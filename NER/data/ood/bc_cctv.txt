how O
the O

Ah O

about B-TIME
11:00 I-TIME
m. I-TIME
yesterday I-TIME

I O
happened O

through O
an O
SMS O
when O
I O
was O

Uh-huh O

Uh-huh O

I O
was O
going O
to O
have O
lunch O

a O

SMS O
, O
Uh-huh O
. O
saying O
he O
would O
come O
pick O
me O
up O
to O

After O

, O
I O
received O
an O
SMS O
from O

Uh-huh O
, O
it O
was O
through O
an O
SMS O
. O

And O

, O
Yang B-PERSON
Yang I-PERSON
? O

A O
friend O
happened O
to O
call O
me O
. O

You O
were O
not O
at O
work O
that B-DATE
day I-DATE
? O

No O
. O

The O
station O
called O
me O
at O
noon B-TIME
and O
said O
something O
happened O
at O
Jingguang B-FAC
Bridge I-FAC
and O
that O
I O
had O
to O
go O
to O
the O
station O
immediately O
to O
research O
the O
upcoming O
program O
. O

Uh-huh O
, O
that O
means O
, O
er O
, O
you O
found O
out O
the O
accident O
through O
an O
information O
source O
at O
the O
station O
. O

Right O
, O
right O
, O
right O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Well O
, O
like O
Professor O
Zhou B-PERSON
, O
I O
also O
received O
this O
news O
, O
ha O
, O
through O
a O
mobile O
phone O
SMS O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
, O
it O
can O
be O
said O
that O
this O
SMS O
was O
among O
the O
many O
, O
ha O
, O
SMS O
containing O
New B-EVENT
Year I-EVENT
wishes O
, O
like O
Happy O
New B-EVENT
Year I-EVENT
, O
received O
after O
the O
start O
of O
the B-EVENT
New I-EVENT
Year I-EVENT
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Ah O
, O
actually O
I O
felt O
a O
lot O
of O
warmth O
when O
I O
received O
that O
SMS O
. O

Although O
we O
live O
in O
the O
west O
instead O
of O
the O
east O
and O
it O
did O
not O
affect O
us O
much O
, O
I O
think O
it O
is O
very O
useful O
, O
ah O
, O
to O
inform O
people O
of O
this O
kind O
of O
news O
. O

Yes O
, O
exceptionally O
. O

Yes O
, O
exceptionally O
. O

Well O
, O
what O
in O
fact O
was O
the O
content O
of O
that O
SMS O
? O

Let O
's O
take O
a O
look O
via O
this O
footage O
, O
ha O
. O

I O
remember O
the O
SMS O
was O
written O
like O
this O
at O
that O
time O
, O
saying O
that O
, O
ah O
, O
there O
was O
a O
sewage O
pipe O
leakage O
accident O
on O
the O
side O
road O
at O
the O
southeast O
corner O
of O
Jingguang B-FAC
Bridge I-FAC
at O
East B-FAC
Third I-FAC
Ring I-FAC
Road I-FAC
, O
and O
, O
well O
, O
traffic O
supervision O
was O
implemented O
near O
Chaoyang B-FAC
Road I-FAC
, O
Jingguang B-FAC
Bridge I-FAC
, O
and O
East B-FAC
Third I-FAC
Ring I-FAC
Road I-FAC
, O
and O
requesting O
cars O
to O
make O
a O
detour O
. O

Some O
car O
owners O
said O
that O
it O
was O
very O
good O
that O
the O
SMS O
was O
sent O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
there O
was O
one B-CARDINAL
last O
sentence O
in O
that O
SMS O
thanking O
citizens O
for O
their O
cooperation O
and O
support O
. O

Ah O
, O
after O
the O
SMS O
was O
sent O
, O
, O
I O
felt O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
that O
Beijing B-GPE
Municipality I-GPE
, O
ah O
, O
used O
an O
SMS O
to O
give O
notification O
at O
the O
time O
of O
a O
public O
emergency O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
all O
of O
us O
are O
living O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
, O
is O
this O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
, O
Professor O
Zhou B-PERSON
? O

Yes O
, O
in O
terms O
of O
an O
official O
notification O
, O
this O
should O
be O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
one O
was O
sent O
officially O
through O
1860 B-CARDINAL
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
in O
private O
life O
, O
people O
have O
used O
SMS O
countless O
times O
to O
spread O
news O
. O

Yes O
. O

Other O
places O
in O
the O
country O
must O
have O
used O
this O
too O
. O

Uh-huh O
, O
uh-huh O
. O

Must O
have O
used O
this O
too O
. O

Actually O
, O
I O
remember O
receiving O
an O
SMS O
like O
this O
one O
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
before O
it O
snowed O
, O
since O
snowfall O
would O
affect O
road O
conditions O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
to O
a O
rather O
large O
extent O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

However O
, O
it O
did O
not O
give O
people O
such O
a O
special O
feeling O
as O
it O
did O
this O
time O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Ah O
, O
when O
an O
SMS O
is O
sent O
to O
inform O
citizens O
of O
such O
an O
incident O
, O
can O
it O
be O
considered O
a O
work O
method O
or O
expression O
of O
government O
information O
transparency O
? O

Yes O
, O
this O
is O
indeed O
through O
the O
very O
successful O
response O
to O
this O
emergency O
, O
ah O
, O
by O
Beijing B-ORG
Municipality I-ORG
, O
Uh-huh O
. O
an O
extremely O
good O
point O
that O
is O
worth O
pondering O
deeply O
, O
worthy O
innovation O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
previously O
our O
news O
announcements O
were O
made O
through O
some O
conventional O
methods O
, O
but O
this O
time O
it O
was O
made O
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
mobile O
phone O
SMS O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
this O
is O
a O
method O
highly O
emphasized O
in O
various O
countries O
' O
development O
of O
e-government O
. O

We O
usually O
make O
it O
sound O
like O
e-government O
is O
something O
unattainable O
. O

Yes O
, O
when O
we O
talked O
about O
e-government O
in O
the O
past O
, O
it O
seemed O
to O
be O
only O
done O
through O
the O
Internet O
. O

Right O
. O

It O
seemed O
that O
computers O
, O
ah O
, O
and O
the O
Internet O
, O
ah O
, O
were O
an O
expression O
of O
e-government O
, O
to O
let O
people O
find O
out O
information O
. O

Well O
, O
presently O
in O
fact O
, O
e-governments O
in O
various O
countries O
apply O
this O
so O
- O
called O
last O
multiple O
- O
exposure O
method O
, O
such O
as O
call O
centers O
, O
such O
as O
electronic O
IDs O
, O
and O
such O
as O
, O
these O
electronic O
signatures O
. O

These O
are O
quite O
sophisticated O
forms O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
more O
terminals O
, O
such O
as O
, O
this O
cable O
television O
, O
ah O
, O
, O
this O
digital O
television O
, O
ah O
, O
and O
mobile O
phone O
SMS O
, O
are O
applied O
in O
e-government O
. O

Hence O
, O
I O
think O
this O
is O
, O
a O
test O
of O
e-government O
because O
, O
as O
I O
remember O
, O
during O
SARS O
in O
2003 B-DATE
, O
people O
at O
that O
time O
criticized O
e-government O
during O
the O
spread O
of O
SARS O
, O
ah O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

They O
said O
that O
e-government O
was O
very O
good O
but O
was O
not O
put O
into O
use O
. O

Well O
, O
this O
time O
I O
think O
that O
a O
short O
SMS O
like O
this O
can O
fully O
create O
interaction O
between O
the O
government O
and O
the O
public O
through O
this O
e-government O
form O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Yes O
. O

We O
drive O
often O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
, O
ha O
, O
Yang B-PERSON
Yang I-PERSON
. O

If O
people O
were O
not O
informed O
of O
such O
a O
traffic O
accident O
through O
SMS O
on O
that B-DATE
day I-DATE
and O
they O
continued O
to O
head O
there O
, O
what O
do O
you O
think O
would O
happen O
if O
people O
did O
not O
know O
what O
was O
going O
on O
and O
the O
jam O
did O
not O
clear O
? O

Yes O
. O

Ah O
, O
well O
, O
I O
think O
it O
would O
have O
been O
real O
paralysis O
. O

This O
is O
the O
most O
appropriate O
word O
to O
use O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
I O
think O
that O
when O
SMS O
was O
used O
to O
announce O
the O
news O
, O
it O
should O
be O
said O
to O
have O
fit O
the O
conditions O
in O
our O
China B-GPE
very O
well O
. O

Why O
is O
that O
so O
? O

This O
is O
because O
, O
it O
should O
be O
said O
that O
China B-GPE
is O
the O
country O
with O
the O
highest O
SMS O
usage O
. O

There O
are O
probably O
not O
as O
many O
chances O
to O
use O
SMS O
in O
foreign O
countries O
compared O
with O
domestically O
, O
in O
China B-GPE
, O
ah O
. O

So O
, O
it O
can O
be O
said O
that O
penetration O
was O
quite O
high O
this O
time O
, O
by O
using O
the O
most O
familiar O
method O
, O
most O
used O
by O
everyone O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
most O
prompt O
and O
most O
convenient O
method O
, O
for O
the O
announcement O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
noticed O
that O
many O
friends O
, O
around O
me O
received O
it O
. O

It O
seems O
that O
almost O
everyone O
received O
this O
SMS O
. O

Yes O
. O

Yes O
. O

The O
effect O
was O
extremely O
good O
, O
ha O
. O

So O
, O
how O
exactly O
did O
citizens O
react O
? O

Let O
's O
take O
a O
look O
at O
the O
reactions O
of O
citizens O
. O

-- O
an O
SMS O
. O

I O
saw O
it O
was O
that B-FAC
Jingguang I-FAC
Bridge I-FAC
. O

Hey O
, O
I O
say O
, O
this O
is O
quite O
good O
, O
quite O
good O
. O

Have O
you O
received O
information O
like O
this O
before O
? O

No O
, O
no O
. O

This O
was O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
. O

The O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
? O

Yes O
, O
yes O
. O

Well O
, O
what O
do O
you O
think O
of O
the O
speed O
at O
which O
the O
government O
responded O
this O
time O
? O

Quite O
fast O
. O

Really O
quite O
fast O
, O
ah O
. O

So O
, O
I O
did O
not O
drive O
today B-DATE
. O

I O
set O
out O
a O
bit O
earlier O
and O
took O
the O
subway O
here O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
that O
the O
response O
of O
the O
government O
was O
fast O
this O
time O
? O

Ah O
, O
the O
response O
was O
quite O
fast O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
various O
media O
announcements O
were O
also O
quite O
prompt O
. O

Colleagues O
and O
friends O
also O
informed O
one O
another O
by O
phone O
calls O
and O
SMS O
. O

I O
think O
this O
plan O
was O
quite O
speedy O
. O

It O
seems O
that O
through O
this O
kind O
of O
SMS O
, O
citizens O
responded O
very O
well O
and O
the O
effect O
was O
excellent O
, O
ha O
. O

Well O
, O
apart O
from O
the O
, O
ah O
, O
point O
on O
information O
disclosure O
brought O
out O
by O
this O
accident O
, O
the O
fact O
is O
that O
the O
activation O
of O
emergency O
contingency O
plans O
by O
the O
, O
ah O
, O
government O
has O
also O
left O
people O
with O
a O
very O
deep O
impression O
. O

Let O
's O
find O
out O
the O
situation O
at O
that O
time O
through O
some O
footage O
. O

Well O
, O
we O
know O
that O
after O

Well O

you O
all O
gave O
an O
extensive O
live O
broadcast O
this O
morning O
. O

A O
special O
program O
. O

Yes O
, O
a O
special O
program O
on O
this O
traffic O
. O

So O
, O
let O
's O
first B-ORDINAL
turn O
our O
attention O
to O
the O
impact O
on O
traffic O
after O
the O
accident O
. O

Judging O
from O
the O
traffic O
control O
measures O
taken O
after O
the O
accident O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
eventual O
impact O
caused O
, O
what O
do O
you O
think O
are O
the O
effects O
? O

Actually O
, O
concerning O
this O
, O
I O
think O
both O
of O
you O
are O
very O
familiar O
with O
the O
traffic O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
. O

Previously O
we O
had O
a O
statistic O
, O
especially O
for O
the O
ring O
roads O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
. O

That O
is O
, O
if O
we O
have O
an O
ordinary O
fender O
bender O
or O
tailgate O
accident O
on O
a O
bridge O
such O
as O
the B-FAC
Jingguang I-FAC
Bridge I-FAC
of O
the B-FAC
Third I-FAC
Ring I-FAC
Road I-FAC
, O
it O
might O
cause O
the O
entire O
Third B-FAC
Ring I-FAC
Road I-FAC
to O
have O
bumper O
- O
to O
- O
bumper O
traffic O
jams O
during O
these O
morning O
and O
evening O
peak O
periods O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

It O
might O
even O
impact O
traffic O
on O
the O
Second B-FAC
Ring I-FAC
Road I-FAC
and O
Fourth B-FAC
Ring I-FAC
Road I-FAC
. O

Well O
, O
ah O
, O
if O
there O
is O
an O
accident O
, O
from O
the O
time O
it O
occurs O
until O
the O
time O
all O
traffic O
is O
cleared O
, O
it O
probably O
takes O
about B-TIME
half I-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME
to I-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME
during O
peak O
periods O
. O

Well O
, O
we O
could O
not O
imagine O
imposing O
temporary O
traffic O
restriction O
measures O
on O
a O
long O
section O
of O
road O
stretching O
from O
Jingguang B-FAC
Bridge I-FAC
to O
Changhong B-FAC
Bridge I-FAC
from O
the O
south O
all O
the O
way O
to O
Guomao B-FAC
Bridge I-FAC
, O
blocking O
the O
main O
and O
side O
roads O
. O

Well O
, O
the O
situation O
would O
be O
unthinkable O
during O
this O
peak O
period O
that O
is O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
day O
of O
work O
for O
everyone O
. O

Hence O
, O
at O
that O
time O
, O
before O
6:30 B-TIME
a I-TIME
.m I-TIME
. I-TIME
today I-TIME
, O
before O
our O
live O
broadcast O
, O
we O
moved O
the O
broadcast O
forward O
, O
and O
before O
the O
live O
broadcast O
we O
were O
very O
worried O
. O

However O
, O
actually O
after O
the B-DATE
entire I-DATE
day I-DATE
today I-DATE
, O
I O
came O
here O
right O
after O
ending O
the O
live O
broadcast O
this O
evening O
to O
continue O
with O
the O
live O
broadcast O
here O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
today B-DATE
people O
indeed O
experienced O
an O
extremely O
high O
volume O
of O
traffic O
flow O
on O
the O
roads O
surrounding O
the O
section O
under O
traffic O
control O
, O
and O
indeed O
there O
was O
a O
very O
big O
traffic O
jam O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

However O
, O
the O
affected O
area O
was O
not O
as O
large O
as O
expected O
. O

Moreover O
, O
some O
people O
made O
detours O
once O
they O
received O
the O
news O
. O

Right O
. O

Psychologically O
, O
people O
felt O
quite O
relieved O
. O

Because O
I O
know O
this O
situation O
. O

Right O
, O
like O
those O
whom O
we O
interviewed O
just O
now O
. O

It O
was O
easy O
to O
handle O
once O
everyone O
understood O
. O

Yes O
, O
ah O
, O
, O
a O
citizen O
, O
he O
said O
, O
I O
set O
out O
today B-DATE
before O
the O
incident O
, O
and O
I O
did O
not O
drive O
after O
I O
was O
informed O
. O

That O
person O
did O
not O
even O
drive O
. O

Right O
. O

Actually O
, O
in O
this O
aspect O
, O
I O
think O
that O
citizens O
were O
really O
quite O
cooperative O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
this O
evening O
, O
we O
, O
received O
an O
SMS O
. O

A O
friend O
said O
, O
I O
work O
on O
the O
12th B-ORDINAL
floor O
of O
the B-FAC
China I-FAC
World I-FAC
Trade I-FAC
Center I-FAC
at O
the B-FAC
Guomao I-FAC
Bridge I-FAC
, O
ah O
. O

We O
were O
discussing O
that O
we O
could O
go O
home O
in O
fewer O
cars O
since O
everyone O
was O
on O
the O
same O
route O
. O

Later O
on O
, O
we O
suggested O
to O
him O
and O
said O
, O
you O
, O
ah O
, O
might O
as O
well O
take O
the O
subway O
, O
because O
you O
can O
directly O
reach O
the O
subway O
once O
you O
get O
down O
from O
the B-FAC
China I-FAC
World I-FAC
Trade I-FAC
Center I-FAC
. O

Right O
. O

Hey O
, O
he O
said O
this O
was O
quite O
a O
good O
idea O
. O

Actually O
, O
I O
think O
everyone O
was O
quite O
cooperative O
and O
also O
quite O
supportive O
in O
this O
aspect O
. O

Yes O
, O
many O
, O
viewers O
not O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
may O
not O
be O
quite O
familiar O
, O
ah O
, O
with O
this O
road O
section O
we O
just O
mentioned O
, O
where O
, O
ah O
, O
the O
accident O
occurred O
. O

Ah O
, O
we O
can O
take O
a O
look O
later O
through O
an O
animation O
. O

This O
road O
represents O
a O
main O
road O
on O
East B-FAC
Third I-FAC
Ring I-FAC
Road I-FAC
, O
with O
problems O
on O
both O
the O
main O
and O
side O
roads O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
Chaoyang B-FAC
Road I-FAC
is O
an O
intersection O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Whether O
it O
is O
Chaoyang B-FAC
Road I-FAC
in O
the O
east O
- O
west O
direction O
or O
the O
main O
and O
side O
roads O
of O
East B-FAC
Third I-FAC
Ring I-FAC
Road I-FAC
in O
the O
south O
- O
north O
direction O
, O
as O
we O
can O
see O
from O
this O
diagram O
, O
it O
can O
be O
said O
that O
the O
area O
at O
the O
main O
and O
side O
roads O
of O
East B-FAC
Third I-FAC
Ring I-FAC
Road I-FAC
normally O
has O
quite O
heavy O
traffic O
, O
especially O
during O
commuting O
times O
. O

Well O
, O
Chaoyang B-FAC
Road I-FAC
is O
a O
very O
important O
artery O
in O
the O
east O
- O
west O
direction O
. O

Yes O
. O

When O
people O
living O
in O
the O
west O
want O
to O
cross O
over O
from O
the O
city O
, O
they O
have O
to O
go O
via O
this O
road O
. O

Hence O
, O
if O
a O
traffic O
accident O
occurs O
at O
this O
place O
, O
we O
can O
indeed O
imagine O
, O
ha O
, O
how O
widespread O
, O
ah O
, O
the O
extent O
of O
the O
impact O
will O
be O
, O
such O
as O
the O
number O
of O
cars O
caught O
in O
traffic O
jams O
. O

Yes O
, O
actually O
I O
think O
everyone O
can O
see O
that O
from O
the O
buses O
that O
cross O
Jingguang B-FAC
Bridge I-FAC
. O

Yes O
. O

As O
buses O
that O
cross O
the B-FAC
Third I-FAC
Ring I-FAC
Road I-FAC
are O
currently O
, O
right O
now O
affected O
by O
the O
Jingguang B-FAC
Bridge I-FAC
accident O
, O
ah O
, O
the O
latest O
results O
this O
morning O
show O
that O
32 B-CARDINAL
bus O
routes O
throughout O
the O
neighborhood O
have O
had O
to O
be O
rerouted O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
think O
that O
perhaps O
many O
friends O
in O
other O
places O
are O
wondering O
how O
one B-CARDINAL
place O
is O
able O
to O
accommodate O
32 B-CARDINAL
commuter O
routes O
. O

If O
the O
accident O
did O
not O
happen O
, O
perhaps O
everyone O
would O
not O
know O
that O
this O
place O
could O
normally O
have O
so O
many O
-- O

It O
is O
really O
like O
this O
, O
just O
look O
at O
the O
bus O
signs O
. O

Right O
. O

Have O
not O
seen O
so O
many O
buses O
. O

Right O
. O

Its O
effect O
on O
people O
has O
been O
extremely O
extensive O
. O

Yes O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Well O
, O
what O
measures O
did O
the O
traffic O
control O
department O
eventually O
take O
to O
direct O
traffic O
? O

Our O
correspondent O
specially O
interviewed O
Director O
Meng B-PERSON
Xianlong I-PERSON
, O
Mr. O
Meng B-PERSON
Xianlong I-PERSON
, O
of O
the B-ORG
Command I-ORG
Center I-ORG
of I-ORG
the I-ORG
Beijing I-ORG
Municipal I-ORG
Traffic I-ORG
Administration I-ORG
. O

Let O
's O
hear O
what O
Director O
Meng B-PERSON
said O
. O

Um O
, O
our O
traffic O
control O
department O
immediately O
activated O
the O
traffic O
emergency O
response O
plan O
. O

In O
the O
roads O
close O
to O
where O
the O
problem O
emerged O
, O
we O
first B-ORDINAL
set O
up O
traffic O
diversion O
points O
for O
traffic O
control O
at O
the O
southern O
and O
northern O
ends O
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
all O
vehicles O
going O
along O
East B-FAC
Third I-FAC
Ring I-FAC
Road I-FAC
had O
to O
make O
a O
detour O
to O
go O
on O
roads O
on O
the O
east O
and O
west O
sides O
. O

East B-FAC
Third I-FAC
Ring I-FAC
Road I-FAC
is O
a O
traffic O
artery O
in O
the O
east O
of O
Beijing B-GPE
that O
links O
the O
north O
and O
the O
south O
. O

In O
order O
to O
ensure O
smooth O
traffic O
in O
the O
eastern O
district O
, O
we O
formulated O
a O
set O
of O
traffic O
diversion O
control O
plans O
. O

We O
set O
up O
traffic O
diversion O
points O
at O
68 B-CARDINAL
locations O
along O
East B-FAC
Second I-FAC
Ring I-FAC
Road I-FAC
, O
East B-FAC
Fourth I-FAC
Ring I-FAC
Road I-FAC
, O
West B-FAC
Dawang I-FAC
Road I-FAC
, O
ah O
, O
and O
related O
roads O
to O
the O
east O
and O
west O
, O
and O
deployed O
more O
than O
210 B-CARDINAL
additional O
police O
officers O
to O
divert O
and O
direct O
traffic O
. O

It O
can O
be O
said O
that O
measures O
were O
very O
promptly O
taken O
. O

Ah O
, O
today B-DATE
is O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
workday O
after O
the O
New B-EVENT
Year I-EVENT
holiday O
. O

Well O
, O
what O
exactly O
was O
the O
situation O
this O
morning O
? O

We O
specially O
sent O
a O
reporter O
to O
the O
scene O
this B-CARDINAL
morning I-CARDINAL
to O
shoot O
some O
footage O
. O

Let O
's O
take O
a O
look O
at O
the O
situation O
this O
morning O
through O
this O
footage O
. O

Well O
, O
from O
this O
footage O
, O
we O
can O
see O
that O
, O
ha O
, O
at O
East B-FAC
Third I-FAC
Ring I-FAC
Road I-FAC
, O
ah O
, O
near O
Guanghua B-FAC
Bridge I-FAC
, O
the O
roads O
here O
that O
lead O
to O
the O
vicinity O
of O
Jingguang B-FAC
Bridge I-FAC
have O
come O
under O
control O
and O
, O
well O
, O
various O
kinds O
of O
signs O
have O
also O
been O
placed O
at O
very O
conspicuous O
locations O
. O

Although O
the O
outdoor O
temperature O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
has O
fallen O
to O
minus B-QUANTITY
3 I-QUANTITY
degrees I-QUANTITY
, O
the O
traffic O
police O
deployed O
additional O
manpower O
on O
the O
roads O
to O
direct O
traffic O
, O
ah O
, O
and O
guide O
drivers O
in O
making O
detours O
. O

Well O
, O
since O
direction O
of O
traffic O
was O
carried O
out O
on O
the O
periphery O
, O
the O
number O
of O
vehicles O
at O
the O
section O
of O
the O
accident O
was O
significantly O
less O
than O
usual O
, O
with O
road O
traffic O
very O
orderly O
. O

Ah O
, O
it O
can O
be O
said O
, O
ah O
, O
Yang B-PERSON
Yang I-PERSON
, O
citizens O
, O
regardless O
of O
whether O
they O
took O
the O
bus O
or O
drove O
, O
their O
mentality O
, O
in O
terms O
of O
being O
understanding O
or O
calm O
, O
ah O
, O
was O
a O
very O
important O
factor O
in O
having O
orderly O
traffic O
at O
the O
scene O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Right O
, O
right O
. O

, O
through O
your O
listeners O
, O
what O
kind O
of O
feedback O
did O
you O
find O
out O
from O
them O
? O

Actually O
, O
this O
morning O
, O
some O
listeners O
, O
ah O
, O
also O
happened O
to O
tell O
us O
about O
it O
via O
mobile O
phone O
SMS O
. O

Since O
we O
know O
that O
Jingguang B-FAC
Bridge I-FAC
is O
located O
in O
the O
CBD B-GPE
district O
, O
well O
there O
are O
many O
office O
buildings O
, O
ah O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
them O
, O
as O
well O
as O
quite O
a O
lot O
of O
friends O
who O
get O
up O
early B-TIME
in I-TIME
the I-TIME
morning I-TIME
to O
go O
to O
work O
. O

Therefore O
, O
they O
sent O
SMS O
saying O
, O
hey O
, O
it O
is O
unusual O
, O
ah O
, O
for O
me O
to O
be O
walking O
to O
the O
bus O
station O
today B-DATE
or O
going O
to O
take O
the O
bus O
. O

Well O
, O
it O
is O
unusual O
for O
me O
to O
enjoy O
a O
very O
pleasant O
morning O
. O

We O
then O
reminded O
everyone O
to O
wear O
extra O
clothing O
. O

This O
shows O
that O
when O
people O
encounter O
such O
kind O
of O
emergency O
, O
they O
have O
started O
to O
be O
able O
to O
face O
it O
with O
a O
very O
calm O
and O
pleasant O
state O
of O
mind O
. O

I O
think O
that O
this O
mentality O
in O
facing O
emergencies O
, O
in O
one B-CARDINAL
respect O
shows O
a O
great O
change O
of O
mentality O
that O
Beijing B-GPE
citizens O
now O
have O
after O
enduring O
several O
tests O
in O
the O
past O
, O
and O
a O
kind O
of O
calmness O
and O
maturity O
after O
having O
experienced O
frustrations O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
I O
think O
it O
can O
also O
fully O
show O
the O
level O
of O
people O
's O
satisfaction O
with O
emergency O
mechanisms O
of O
the O
operational O
departments O
of O
the O
government O
in O
handling O
this O
incident O
. O

That O
is O
, O
they O
think O
that O
the O
government O
has O
tried O
its O
best O
. O

Well O
, O
in O
this O
respect O
, O
we O
citizens O
should O
also O
contribute O
our O
efforts O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

As O
such O
, O
in O
this O
regard O
, O
I O
think O
people O
's O
mentality O
can O
become O
very O
calm O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Well O
, O
Professor O
Zhou B-PERSON
, O
from O
this O
perspective O
, O
is O
this O
one B-CARDINAL
highly O
positive O
effect O
achieved O
after O
information O
was O
disclosed O
? O

Yes O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
citizens O
' O
mentality O
. O

Yes O
, O
in O
fact O
it O
can O
be O
seen O
from O
this O
particular O
case O
. O

That O
is O
, O
when O
the O
government O
was O
handling O
this O
kind O
of O
public O
emergency O
, O
well O
, O
it O
went O
from O
a O
traditionally O
unilateral O
administrative O
management O
method O
, O
well O
, O
a O
method O
in O
which O
information O
was O
quite O
delayed O
, O
to O
disclosure O
and O
transparency O
of O
information O
, O
and O
very O
fast O
as O
well O
. O

We O
know O
that O
in O
the O
past O
, O
disclosure O
of O
information O
had O
to O
be O
reported O
to O
higher O
authorities O
, O
level O
by O
level O
, O
until O
the O
highest O
authorities O
had O
given O
approval O
, O
before O
information O
could O
be O
disclosed O
. O

Time O
was O
lost O
. O

Well O
, O
yes O
, O
the B-ORG
State I-ORG
Council I-ORG
has O
, O
er O
, O
put O
forth O
a O
regulation O
concerning O
the O
establishment O
of O
public O
early O
warning O
mechanisms O
. O

That O
is O
, O
related O
information O
that O
can O
be O
publicized O
will O
be O
publicized O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
in O
order O
to O
guide O
people O
in O
what O
to O
do O
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
related O
interaction O
between O
the O
government O
and O
the O
people O
can O
be O
formed O
. O

That O
is O
, O
in O
modern O
public O
management O
, O
ah O
, O
this O
is O
a O
very O
good O
case O
, O
that O
is O
, O
of O
shifting O
from O
a O
kind O
of O
unilateral O
administrative O
management O
to O
public O
management O
and O
to O
positive O
interaction O
between O
the O
government O
and O
the O
people O
. O

I O
think O
in O
fact O
, O
we O
can O
sum O
up O
many O
beneficial O
experiences O
from O
this O
case O
and O
actually O
extend O
them O
to O
other O
areas O
. O

Yes O
, O
this O
is O
when O
we O
look O
at O
this O
case O
from O
the O
perspective O
of O
traffic O
. O

Traffic O
was O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
thing O
to O
be O
impacted O
when O
this O
, O
cave O
- O
in O
accident O
occurred O
. O

However O
, O
this O
accident O
actually O
involved O
many O
underground O
pipes O
, O
such O
as O
sewage O
pipes O
, O
ah O
, O
or O
water O
, O
ah O
, O
and O
gas O
, O
ah O
, O
pipes O
, O
that O
affect O
the O
lives O
of O
citizens O
in O
many O
other O
aspects O
. O

Yes O
. O

Yang B-PERSON
Yang I-PERSON
, O
do O
you O
know O
how O
many O
pipes O
there O
are O
underground O
? O

Right O
now O
, O
there O
should O
be O
seven O
main O
types O
of O
pipes O
buried O
underground O
. O

They O
include O
those O
like O
you O
just O
mentioned O
, O
as O
well O
as O
pipes O
like O
those O
for O
heating O
and O
communication O
, O
among O
others O
. O

Truly O
, O
these O
pipes O
are O
closely O
linked O
to O
the O
lives O
of O
citizens O
. O

Closely O
linked O
. O

Yes O
, O
therefore O
besides O
our O
attention O
to O
the O
traffic O
issue O
just O
now O
, O
people O
are O
also O
very O
concerned O
, O
ah O
, O
with O
the O
situation O
after O
the O
accident O
, O
with O
other O
aspects O
affecting O
citizens O
' O
lives O
. O

Let O
's O
take O
a O
look O
again O
at O
this O
footage O
of O
the O
situation O
of O
dealing O
with O
the O
current O
scene O
. O

Ah O
, O
according O
to O
our O
understanding O
of O
the O
situation O
, O
the B-ORG
Beijing I-ORG
Municipal I-ORG
Construction I-ORG
Commission I-ORG
, O
ah O
, O
the B-ORG
Communication I-ORG
Commission I-ORG
, O
ah O
, O
and O
telecommunication O
, O
traffic O
, O
and O
other O
departments O
have O
assigned O
personnel O
to O
participate O
in O
emergency O
repair O
work O
. O

Relevant O
departments O
said O
that O
they O
will O
adopt O
a O
full O
range O
of O
measures O
to O
minimize O
the O
level O
of O
impact O
on O
people O
's O
daily O
lives O
and O
work O
, O
in O
order O
to O
ensure O
stable O
order O
in O
society O
during O
the O
recovery O
period O
. O

Well O
, O
looking O
at O
the O
government O
's O
response O
to O
this O
cave O
- O
in O
accident O
, O
ah O
, O
we O
should O
say O
it O
was O
very O
prompt O
with O
traffic O
management O
and O
emergency O
repair O
, O
ah O
, O
because O
it O
involved O
various O
aspects O
of O
life O
. O

Well O
, O
ah O
, O
Professor O
Zhou B-PERSON
, O
as O
this O
incident O
involved O
many O
departments O
after O
it O
took O
place O
, O
how O
do O
you O
think O
the O
various O
departments O
should O
coordinate O
between O
themselves O
? O

Yes O
. O

This O
is O
also O
-- O

It O
is O
not O
the O
case O
that O
this O
problem O
will O
be O
totally O
solved O
when O
one O
department O
shows O
up O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
think O
as O
we O
build O
this O
kind O
, O
er O
, O
of O
public O
, O
this O
kind O
of O
emergency O
mechanism O
for O
public O
incidents O
, O
ah O
, O
has O
been O
the O
, O
most O
difficult O
to O
resolve O
, O
an O
actual O
problem O
that O
has O
been O
the O
most O
difficult O
to O
resolve O
among O
administrative O
management O
reforms O
in O
various O
countries O
. O

How O
many O
groups O
of O
people O
will O
be O
sent O
? O

Many O
groups O
. O

Yes O
, O
this O
is O
because O
social O
management O
requires O
division O
of O
labor O
in O
society O
. O

It O
is O
necessarily O
a O
labor O
division O
trend O
that O
involves O
many O
departments O
, O
and O
in O
addition O
, O
a O
kind O
of O
modern O
management O
public O
administration O
model O
which O
is O
diversified O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

How O
can O
cooperation O
be O
formed O
between O
departments O
in O
this O
kind O
of O
situation O
? O

Well O
, O
sometimes O
under O
normal O
circumstances O
, O
sometimes O
, O
we O
often O
feel O
that O
it O
is O
very O
difficult O
for O
departments O
to O
cooperate O
with O
one O
another O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
there O
are O
too O
many O
law O
enforcement O
departments O
and O
, O
ah O
, O
too O
many O
administrative O
departments O
, O
and O
very O
often O
in O
the O
end O
, O
they O
are O
unable O
to O
coordinate O
. O

However O
, O
this O
time O
, O
through O
the O
execution O
of O
emergency O
contingency O
plans O
by O
Beijing B-GPE
Municipality I-GPE
this O
time O
, O
ah O
, O
it O
should O
be O
said O
that O
the O
response O
speed O
of O
the O
different O
departments O
of O
Beijing B-GPE
Municipality I-GPE
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
integrated O
emergency O
mechanisms O
, O
played O
a O
great O
role O
. O

Hence O
, O
I O
think O
this O
was O
also O
a O
kind O
of O
, O
er O
, O
trial O
of O
interdepartmental O
cooperation O
mechanisms O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

It O
was O
a O
very O
successful O
, O
er O
, O
response O
. O

I O
think O
many O
good O
things O
can O
be O
summed O
up O
from O
this O
. O

Yes O
. O

Yang B-PERSON
Yang I-PERSON
, O
based O
on O
your O
understanding O
, O
ah O
, O
as O
pipes O
that O
directly O
affect O
many O
common O
people O
's O
lives O
were O
damaged O
after O
the O
accident O
, O
based O
on O
your O
understanding O
of O
the O
situation O
, O
how O
was O
remedial O
work O
carried O
out O
? O

For O
instance O
, O
it O
is O
very O
cold O
during O
winter O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
, O
and O
the O
temperature O
last B-TIME
night I-TIME
dropped O
to O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
lowest O
points O
recently O
. O

Er O
, O
heating O
pipes O
were O
indeed O
damaged O
. O

Well O
, O
at O
the O
time O
, O
it O
affected O
residents O
living O
in O
an O
area O
of O
about B-QUANTITY
70,000 I-QUANTITY
square I-QUANTITY
meters I-QUANTITY
of O
Beijing B-GPE
. O

Well O
, O
, O
in O
this O
regard O
, O
the O
Chaoyang B-GPE
district O
government O
did O
a O
very O
good O
job O
. O

After O
it O
, O
er O
, O
received O
this O
order O
from O
the O
municipal O
government O
, O
it O
immediately O
sent O
, O
electric O
heaters O
to O
residents O
in O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
200 I-CARDINAL
households O
within O
this O
area O
. O

It O
should O
be O
said O
that O
many O
residents O
spent O
quite O
a O
warm O
night O
at O
home O
yesterday B-DATE
. O

Well O
, O
furthermore O
, O
in O
the O
emergency O
repair O
process O
, O
ah O
, O
it O
should O
be O
said O
that O
the O
heating O
pipeline O
was O
restored O
relatively O
quickly O
. O

Hence O
, O
over O
here O
, O
I O
think O
the O
municipal O
government O
, O
ah O
, O
including O
sub-district O
offices O
, O
made O
a O
lot O
of O
effort O
to O
take O
good O
care O
of O
resident O
households O
. O

I O
think O
it O
was O
done O
in O
a O
very O
humanitarian O
manner O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Professor O
Zhou B-PERSON
, O
actually O
for O
such O
a O
large O
scale O
city O
as O
Beijing B-GPE
that O
has O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
14 I-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
people O
, O
ah O
, O
for O
such O
a O
big O
city O
, O
a O
suddenly O
occurring O
public O
emergency O
like O
this O
should O
be O
said O
to O
be O
relatively O
common O
. O

Yes O
. O

I O
think O
it O
should O
be O
unexpected O
yet O
at O
the O
same O
time O
within O
expectations O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
we O
see O
that O
other O
, O
er O
, O
domestic O
and O
overseas O
cities O
have O
experienced O
similar O
incidents O
. O

Perhaps O
many O
overseas O
cities O
have O
had O
such O
kind O
of O
thing O
before O
. O

This O
is O
because O
a O
city O
is O
a O
gathering O
place O
for O
modern O
life O
. O

It O
is O
a O
highly O
civilized O
place O
, O
as O
well O
as O
, O
however O
, O
in O
fact O
a O
gathering O
point O
for O
various O
conflicts O
, O
social O
, O
economic O
, O
security O
, O
various O
aspects O
of O
conflict O
. O

Hence O
it O
is O
not O
at O
all O
surprising O
for O
such O
an O
accident O
to O
occur O
. O

The O
critical O
thing O
is O
-- O

But O
the O
critical O
thing O
is O
how O
emergency O
plans O
are O
activated O
after O
the O
occurrence O
of O
such O
accidents O
, O
and O
for O
a O
city O
, O
this O
is O
a O
test O
of O
its O
response O
capabilities O
. O

Yes O
. O

Yes O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
think O
through O
a O
few O
incidents O
that O
happened O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
Municipality I-GPE
over O
recent B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
such O
as O
SARS O
, O
the O
snowfall O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
the O
heavy O
rains O
two O
years O
ago O
, O
and O
the O
road O
cave O
- O
in O
at O
East B-FAC
Third I-FAC
Ring I-FAC
Road I-FAC
this O
time O
, O
I O
think O
it O
can O
be O
seen O
that O
Beijing B-GPE
Municipality I-GPE
's I-GPE
response O
capabilities O
continued O
to O
improve O
each O
time O
. O

Right O
. O

It O
can O
be O
said O
that O
this O
time O
, O
what O
was O
done O
has O
received O
favorable O
comments O
from O
everyone O
. O

Um O
, O
well O
, O
I O
think O
, O
Yang B-PERSON
Yang I-PERSON
, O
perhaps O
you O
have O
stronger O
feelings O
on O
this O
aspect O
, O
ah O
. O

Yes O
. O

Because O
you O
often O
have O
this O
kind O
of O
direct O
SMS O
exchange O
with O
listeners O
. O

It O
is O
because O
, O
we O
, O
Beijing B-ORG
Traffic I-ORG
Radio I-ORG
Station I-ORG
, O
has O
become O
a O
part O
of O
emergency O
planning O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
. O

Well O
, O
Beijing B-ORG
Traffic I-ORG
Radio I-ORG
Station I-ORG
is O
to O
be O
activated O
as O
a O
media O
for O
emergency O
plans O
that O
are O
grade O
three B-CARDINAL
and O
above O
. O

Well O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
as O
people O
still O
vividly O
remember O
, O
at O
the O
time O
of O
that O
snowfall O
just O
mentioned O
by O
Professor O
Zhou B-PERSON
that O
people O
still O
vividly O
remember O
, O
there O
were O
no O
plans O
. O

Beijing B-GPE
Municipality I-GPE
still O
had O
no O
emergency O
plan O
. O

Well O
, O
at O
that O
time O
, O
it O
happened O
that O
I O
was O
hosting O
the O
Unblocked B-ORG
All I-ORG
the I-ORG
Way I-ORG
program O
in O
the O
studio O
that B-TIME
evening I-TIME
. O

Well O
, O
at O
that O
time O
, O
traffic O
was O
not O
at O
all O
unblocked O
. O

Ah O
, O
at O
that O
time O
there O
was O
none O
of O
this O
kind O
of O
interaction O
. O

It O
was O
not O
clear O
, O
it O
was O
very O
congested O
. O

You O
sat O
inside O
the O
studio O
and O
only O
knew O
about O
the O
heavy O
snowfall O
. O

You O
could O
find O
out O
other O
news O
only O
by O
telephone O
. O

The O
various O
methods O
and O
channels O
were O
extremely O
unclear O
. O

Well O
, O
later O
, O
when O
we O
experienced O
that O
rainfall O
in O
Beijing O
, O
that O
rainfall O
two B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
as O
well O
as O
some O
days O
of O
sand O
storms O
, O
all O
channels O
and O
early O
warning O
mechanisms O
were O
activated O
in O
quite O
an O
orderly O
manner O
. O

From O
our O
perspective O
as O
media O
, O
I O
think O
it O
was O
precisely O
by O
going O
through O
those O
breaking O
- O
in O
, O
trials O
that O
we O
could O
be O
so O
calm O
in O
handling O
such O
an O
emergency O
today B-DATE
, O
ah O
, O
and O
give O
everyone O
the O
most O
effective O
announcements O
and O
notifications O
, O
and O
instructions O
. O

Yes O
, O
therefore O
, O
as O
a O
local O
media O
in O
this O
city O
, O
it O
should O
become O
a O
proactive O
participant O
when O
there O
is O
a O
public O
emergency O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Yes O
. O

It O
should O
play O
its O
individual O
role O
in O
the O
process O
of O
resolving O
emergencies O
. O

Ah O
, O
apart O
from O
this O
, O
Professor O
Zhou B-PERSON
, O
what O
do O
you O
think O
are O
the O
areas O
for O
improvement O
for O
a O
city O
, O
especially O
a O
booming O
city O
, O
when O
handling O
this O
kind O
of O
public O
emergency O
? O

Right O
, O
I O
think O
this O
gave O
us O
many O
revelations O
, O
ah O
. O

First B-ORDINAL
, O
I O
think O
one O
that O
should O
be O
especially O
important O
is O
early O
warnings O
and O
forecasts O
. O

This O
is O
because O
currently O
, O
there O
are O
, O
ah O
, O
frequently O
various O
kinds O
of O
risks O
lurking O
in O
cities O
, O
ah O
. O

Early O
warnings O
and O
forecasts O
. O

Yes O
, O
this O
kind O
of O
early O
warning O
and O
forecast O
mechanism O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

It O
is O
not O
only O
for O
, O
this O
kind O
of O
sudden O
road O
cave O
- O
in O
, O
it O
also O
includes O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
security O
incidents O
, O
ah O
, O
in O
our O
society O
, O
as O
well O
as O
natural O
disasters O
, O
ah O
, O
and O
including O
public O
health O
incidents O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

That O
is O
, O
this O
kind O
of O
scientific O
early O
warning O
and O
forecast O
mechanism O
must O
be O
set O
up O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
you O
can O
manage O
and O
resolve O
an O
abnormal O
situation O
by O
turning O
it O
into O
a O
normal O
situation O
, O
without O
evolving O
into O
a O
sudden O
public O
emergency O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Another O
thing O
I O
want O
to O
say O
is O
that O
besides O
, O
ah O
, O
emergency O
response O
and O
speedy O
integration O
mechanisms O
, O
I O
think O
some O
corresponding O
improvements O
should O
be O
made O
to O
the O
release O
of O
information O
, O
incident O
investigation O
, O
ah O
, O
and O
the O
relevant O
post-incident O
, O
responsibility O
system O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
, O
that O
is O
, O
we O
should O
say O
that O
the O
government O
already O
has O
quite O
a O
number O
of O
relevant O
systems O
in O
this O
respect O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
we O
have O
an O
administrative O
investigation O
system O
for O
incidents O
of O
major O
responsibility O
. O

We O
have O
regulations O
on O
investigation O
procedures O
for O
very O
major O
incidents O
, O
as O
well O
as O
others O
such O
as O
emergency O
response O
methods O
for O
handling O
public O
health O
incidents O
and O
public O
health O
emergencies O
, O
among O
others O
. O

That O
is O
to O
say O
, O
we O
have O
many O
corresponding O
systems O
. O

However O
, O
the O
question O
is O
how O
city O
management O
, O
er O
, O
handles O
these O
various O
kinds O
of O
perhaps O
unpredictable O
cases O
. O

Since O
we O
are O
entering O
new O
circumstances O
of O
human O
living O
, O
circumstances O
that O
contain O
high O
risk O
and O
have O
an O
increasingly O
developed O
urbanized O
life O
, O
well O
, O
I O
think O
corresponding O
improvements O
should O
be O
made O
to O
the O
formation O
of O
a O
series O
of O
systems O
that O
includes O
scientific O
planning O
, O
early O
warning O
and O
forecast O
, O
emergency O
response O
, O
accident O
investigation O
, O
and O
accountability O
. O

Um O
, O
well O
, O
based O
on O
your O
understanding O
of O
the O
situation O
, O
and O
from O
an O
international O
perspective O
, O
what O
are O
some O
better O
ways O
of O
urban O
management O
that O
are O
worthwhile O
for O
us O
to O
learn O
? O

I O
think O
, O
in O
comparison O
to O
China B-GPE
, O
we O
should O
say O
that O
urbanization O
in O
foreign O
countries O
developed O
earlier O
and O
is O
more O
widespread O
. O

Their O
level O
of O
development O
is O
more O
advanced O
than O
ours O
. O

Although O
the O
scale O
of O
our O
urbanization O
is O
currently O
expanding O
at O
a O
rate O
of O
1 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
per O
year O
, O
I O
think O
, O
with O
our O
economic O
development O
being O
relatively O
backward O
, O
we O
actually O
still O
have O
many O
aspects O
of O
urban O
management O
to O
learn O
from O
foreign O
countries O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
many O
of O
the O
pipes O
involved O
in O
this O
incident O
were O
basic O
infrastructure O
, O
public O
utilities O
industries O
. O

With O
a O
background O
of O
liberalization O
, O
marketization O
, O
and O
privatization O
, O
how O
can O
the O
government O
strengthen O
supervision O
of O
public O
utilities O
industries O
? O

How O
can O
a O
safe O
, O
assured O
system O
be O
established O
? O

Well O
, O
we O
need O
to O
learn O
and O
manage O
this O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
regarding O
information O
disclosure O
, O
well O
, O
our O
speed O
of O
information O
disclosure O
this O
time O
was O
very O
fast O
. O

However O
, O
we O
still O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
work O
to O
do O
in O
making O
the O
information O
disclosure O
, O
er O
, O
system O
more O
standardized O
, O
that O
is O
, O
to O
really O
implement O
a O
system O
of O
levels O
of O
responsibility O
. O

Well O
, O
we O
also O
need O
to O
explore O
how O
cooperation O
mechanisms O
between O
departments O
execute O
cooperation O
under O
normal O
situations O
and O
, O
well O
, O
how O
departments O
should O
cooperate O
with O
one O
another O
under O
these O
kinds O
of O
public O
emergency O
circumstances O
. O

Well O
, O
for O
some O
of O
our O
emergency O
contingency O
plans O
, O
well O
, O
ah O
, O
how O
will O
these O
emergency O
contingency O
plans O
withstand O
these O
tests O
? O

We O
know O
that O
currently O
, O
many O
ministries O
and O
commissions O
, O
as O
well O
as O
people O
's O
governments O
at O
the O
provincial O
level O
, O
along O
with O
those O
at O
municipal O
and O
district O
levels O
, O
have O
set O
up O
emergency O
contingency O
plans O
for O
public O
emergencies O
, O
but O
many O
of O
them O
have O
not O
been O
put O
to O
the O
test O
. O

Well O
, O
how O
will O
they O
undergo O
testing O
? O

These O
also O
include O
some O
of O
our O
command O
and O
policy O
- O
making O
systems O
. O

So O
, O
with O
the O
growth O
of O
urbanization O
and O
with O
more O
and O
more O
of O
such O
complicated O
issues O
, O
ah O
, O
I O
think O
there O
will O
be O
increasingly O
high O
requirements O
on O
the O
systems O
. O

That O
is O
, O
development O
of O
future O
systems O
is O
one O
of O
the O
top O
current O
priorities O
. O

How O
can O
we O
institutionalize O
our O
response O
mechanisms O
and O
make O
them O
into O
a O
system O
so O
as O
to O
ensure O
the O
lifestyle O
of O
people O
who O
live O
in O
such O
a O
large O
- O
scale O
city O
? O

The B-ORG
State I-ORG
Council I-ORG
has O
proposed O
a O
public O
emergency O
contingency O
plan O
, O
called O
One B-CARDINAL
Plan O
, O
Three B-CARDINAL
Systems O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

" O
One B-CARDINAL
plan O
" O
refers O
to O
the O
contingency O
plan O
, O
and O
" O
three B-CARDINAL
systems O
" O
refers O
to O
systems O
of O
organizations O
, O
mechanisms O
, O
and O
laws O
. O

So O
, O
I O
think O
we O
still O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
work O
to O
do O
in O
these O
three B-CARDINAL
areas O
of O
organizations O
, O
mechanisms O
, O
and O
laws O
. O

Yes O
. O

Well O
, O
finally O
, O
let O
's O
turn O
our O
attention O
to O
handling O
of O
the O
situation O
, O
ah O
, O
during O
the O
latter O
stages O
of O
the O
cave O
- O
in O
accident O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
. O

Traffic O
, O
ah O
, O
can O
be O
said O
to O
have O
been O
directed O
, O
and O
is O
basically O
under O
control O
now O
. O

Well O
, O
following O
this O
, O
repairs O
have O
to O
be O
made O
on O
this O
road O
section O
where O
the O
accident O
occurred O
, O
including O
for O
many O
pipes O
. O

Well O
, O
Yang B-PERSON
Yang I-PERSON
, O
based O
on O
your O
understanding O
, O
how O
long O
will O
it O
take O
? O

I O
think O
that O
the O
time O
really O
depends O
on O
how O
the O
overall O
repair O
goes O
. O

This O
is O
because O
exploration O
, O
assessment O
, O
and O
repair O
are O
carried O
out O
in O
succession O
. O

Therefore O
, O
regarding O
this O
work O
progress O
, O
to O
repair O
this O
road O
section O
in O
the O
shortest O
time O
, O
um O
, O
this O
will O
depend O
on O
the O
work O
progress O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

This O
is O
because O
repair O
is O
probably O
not O
a O
matter O
of O
repairing O
the O
road O
surface O
alone O
. O

There O
is O
also O
an O
issue O
with O
many O
of O
the O
pipes O
below O
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
pipes O
below O
. O

Right O
, O
as O
it O
is O
winter O
, O
we O
know O
that O
carrying O
out O
construction O
during O
winter O
, O
especially O
that O
which O
requires O
pouring O
concrete O
and O
then O
-- O

Moreover O
, O
it O
is O
especially O
difficult O
for O
concrete O
to O
set O
during O
winter O
. O

Yes O
, O
preparation O
mix O
for O
making O
it O
dry O
faster O
, O
has O
already O
been O
added O
. O

But O
in O
the O
end O
, O
it O
requires O
time O
. O

Hence O
, O
it O
depends O
very O
much O
on O
factors O
like O
temperature O
. O

Just O
now O
, O
you O
mentioned O
that O
there O
are O
many O
pipes O
, O
ah O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
there O
is O
a O
key O
heating O
pipeline O
. O

The O
first O
thing O
is O
to O
ensure O
that O
it O
is O
connected O
in O
time O
. O

Yes O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
waste O
discharge O
is O
also O
very O
important O
. O

Waste O
discharged O
has O
currently O
blocked O
this O
up O
. O

Um O
, O
and O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
optical O
fibers O
, O
ah O
. O

Er O
, O
right O
now O
, O
if O
the O
optical O
fibers O
break O
, O
people O
in O
many O
households O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
watch O
television O
. O

Yes O
. O

At O
present O
, O
we O
should O
not O
have O
a O
problem O
with O
watching O
television O
. O

They O
are O
not O
broken O
. O

It O
is O
just O
that O
, O
as O
the O
other O
pipes O
have O
to O
be O
repaired O
, O
the O
optical O
fibers O
have O
to O
be O
rearranged O
, O
to O
be O
hung O
up O
it O
seems O
. O

After O
that O
, O
or O
it O
seems O
that O
a O
few O
steel O
pipes O
have O
been O
added O
below O
to O
make O
it O
safer O
to O
walk O
across O
this O
section O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
let O
's O
take O
water O
pipes O
as O
an O
example O
. O

Because O
they O
were O
exposed O
, O
The O
water O
pipes O
were O
not O
-- O

after O
that O
, O
yes O
, O
these O
were O
not O
damaged O
. O

they O
were O
not O
damaged O
and O
this O
is O
quite O
normal O
. O

Um O
, O
there O
is O
no O
problem O
with O
water O
supply O
. O

Okay O
, O
well O
, O
today B-DATE
both O
of O
you O
have O
come O
to O
the O
studio O
and O
given O
us O
a O
lot O
of O
specific O
details O
concerning O
this O
road O
cave O
- O
in O
accident O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
Municipality I-GPE
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
you O
have O
also O
analyzed O
, O
from O
a O
system O
perspective O
, O
how O
the O
government O
has O
reinforced O
emergency O
contingency O
plans O
to O
handle O
such O
public O
emergency O
cases O
. O

Okay O
