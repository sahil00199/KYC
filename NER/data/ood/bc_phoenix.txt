Children O
are O
left O
at O
home O
in O
the O
rural O
areas O
, O
after O
parents O
leave O
to O
work O
in O

These O
are O
called O
left O

children O

The O

are O
also O
forced O
to O
work O
in O
the O

In O
fact O
, O
they O
have O
no O

to O
make O
such O
a O
decision O

There O
are O
120 B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
farmers O
who O
work O
in O
the O

all O
year O
round O
in O
China B-GPE

thus O
creating O
nearly O
20 B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
left O

behind O
children O
. O

I O
want O
to O
tell O
them O
that O
I O
miss O
them O
a O

. O

Day O
after O
day O
and O
year O
after O

, O
they O
long O
for O
love O
in O
loneliness O
and O
wait O
for O

affection O
in O

I O
think O
that O
it O
is O
especially O
important O
to O
have O
emotional O

with O
the O
children O

Visit O
the O
children O
more O

the O

of O

, O
the O

the O
task O
force O
to O
conduct O
many O
field O
interviews O
and O
investigations O
on O
left O
- O
behind O
children O
in O
numerous O
rural O
areas O
in O
central O
and O
western O
China B-GPE
, O
including O
Shaanxi B-GPE
, O
Ningxia B-GPE
, O
Hebei B-GPE
, O
and O
Beijing B-GPE
. O

Why O
did O
you O
pick O
the O
central O
and O
western O
parts O
of O
China B-GPE
, O
and O
not O
the O
south O
, O
to O
conduct O
this O
study O
? O

First B-ORDINAL
of O
all O
, O
for O
people O
who O
work O
in O
the O
city O
from O
the O
central O
and O
western O
regions O
um O
, O
uh O
, O
according O
to O
their O
educational O
level O
, O
they O
generally O
engage O
in O
strenuous O
manual O
labor O
when O
they O
leave O
for O
the O
city O
to O
work O
. O

They O
are O
not O
in O
a O
position O
to O
bring O
their O
children O
to O
the O
city O
. O

When O
we O
conducted O
this O
research O
study O
, O
our O
focus O
was O
to O
analyze O
the O
impact O
on O
children O
when O
their O
parents O
, O
work O
in O
the O
city O
. O

, O
its O
main O
impact O
is O
the O
lack O
of O
love O
because O
of O
the O
absence O
of O
their O
parents O
. O

Therefore O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
whether O
it O
's O
in O
southern O
or O
northern O
part O
, O
no O
matter O
which O
part O
of O
the O
country O
the O
research O
is O
conducted O
in O
, O
the O
results O
should O
be O
consistent O
. O

According O
to O
your O
estimation O
, O
how O
many O
left O
- O
behind O
children O
are O
there O
in O
China B-GPE
now O
? O

This O
group O
should O
be O
the O
biggest O
in O
number O
. O

Um O
, O
the O
most O
conservative O
statistics O
for O
the O
group O
of O
people O
who O
leave O
the O
country O
to O
work O
in O
the O
city O
in O
our O
country O
is O
100 B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
. O

Nowadays O
, O
um O
, O
, O
um O
, O
many O
places O
, O
um O
, O
cite O
a O
figure O
of O
120 B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
. O

Many O
people O
quote O
a O
figure O
of O
150 B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
. O

Let O
's O
think O
about O
it O
this O
way O
. O

If O
we O
actually O
use O
120 B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
as O
the O
statistic O
for O
the O
group O
who O
leave O
the O
country O
to O
work O
in O
the O
city O
, O
, O
at O
least O
half B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
are O
um O
, O
married O
before O
they O
work O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
families O
of O
these O
married O
people O
will O
usually O
have O
children O
. O

Moreover O
, O
they O
will O
usually O
have O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
child O
in O
rural O
areas O
. O

So O
you O
can O
imagine O
. O

I O
believe O
the O
left O
- O
behind O
children O
group O
is O
definitely O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
10 I-CARDINAL
or I-CARDINAL
20 I-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
. O

It O
, O
uh O
, O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
should O
be O
around O
50 B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
. O

Of O
course O
, O
we O
have O
not O
conducted O
exact O
statistical O
calculations O
. O

I O
believe O
the O
number O
of O
this O
group O
should O
be O
particularly O
large O
. O

According O
to O
the O
study O
by O
the O
task O
force O
, O
at O
present O
, O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
main O
types O
of O
custody O
for O
left O
- O
behind O
children O
include O
single O
- O
parent O
custody O
, O
skip O
- O
generation O
custody O
, O
relative O
custody O
, O
and O
same O
- O
generation O
custody O
. O
Among O
which O
, O
single O
- O
parent O
custody O
had O
the O
highest O
number O
, O
accounting O
for O
79.2 B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
of O
the O
people O
surveyed O
. O

The O
next O
one B-CARDINAL
was O
skip O
- O
generation O
custody O
, O
accounting O
for O
16.9 B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
. O
While O
those O
who O
lived O
with O
relatives O
or O
were O
entrusted O
to O
the O
care O
of O
someone O
else O
made O
up O
4.1 B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
and O
.9 B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
of O
the O
total O
number O
of O
left O
- O
behind O
children O
, O
respectively O
. O

According O
to O
your O
study O
, O
what O
do O
these O
left O
- O
behind O
children O
generally O
do O
with O
their O
daily O
life O
if O
their O
parents O
or O
parent O
work O
in O
the O
city O
? O

Different O
types O
of O
custody O
have O
different O
impacts O
on O
their O
life O
. O

No O
doubt O
, O
, O
single O
- O
parent O
custody O
definitely O
creates O
less O
impact O
compared O
to O
the O
other O
types O
. O

The O
impact O
of O
single O
- O
parent O
custody O
is O
smaller O
because O
at O
least O
the O
mother O
is O
at O
home O
. O

There O
is O
no O
major O
problem O
in O
the O
children O
's O
material O
life O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
there O
are O
many O
impacts O
in O
other O
aspects O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
peer O
socialization O
. O

The O
one B-CARDINAL
that O
creates O
a O
huge O
impact O
is O
definitely O
skip O
- O
generation O
custody O
. O

Skip O
- O
generation O
custody O
means O
the O
grandparents O
look O
after O
the O
children O
. O

There O
is O
also O
relative O
or O
neighbor O
custody O
that O
asks O
neighbors O
or O
relatives O
to O
look O
after O
the O
children O
, O
and O
there O
is O
a O
type O
called O
self O
- O
custody O
. O

These O
three B-CARDINAL
types O
create O
the O
biggest O
and O
the O
most O
impact O
. O

If O
we O
want O
to O
discuss O
this O
in O
more O
detail O
, O
let O
's O
say O
, O
the O
skip O
- O
generation O
custody O
. O

First B-ORDINAL
, O
in O
skip O
- O
generation O
custody O
, O
their O
material O
life O
will O
no O
doubt O
be O
a O
lot O
less O
taken O
care O
of O
when O
compared O
to O
the O
usual O
both O
parents O
or O
one O
parent O
at O
home O
situation O
. O

This O
is O
indisputable O
. O

This O
type O
of O
family O
is O
not O
as O
good O
as O
the O
others O
. O

We O
had O
an O
example O
of O
a O
child O
in O
Shaanxi B-GPE
province I-GPE
. O

Um O
, O
there O
was O
a O
family O
! O

This O
family O
had O
an O
older O
brother O
and O
a O
younger O
sister O
. O

Both O
parents O
wanted O
to O
go O
to O
the O
city O
to O
work O
. O

The O
father O
went O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
and O
later O
the O
mother O
wanted O
to O
go O
, O
too O
. O

What O
happened O
to O
these O
two B-CARDINAL
children O
? O

The O
grandparents O
were O
unwilling O
to O
take O
care O
of O
them O
because O
in O
rural O
areas O
, O
grandparents O
also O
have O
to O
work O
in O
the O
field O
! O

As O
a O
result O
, O
, O
this O
mother O
sent O
, O
these O
brother O
and O
sister O
, O
to O
martial O
arts O
school O
to O
study O
. O

After O
they O
went O
to O
the O
martial O
arts O
school O
for O
a O
while O
, O
um O
, O
their O
mother O
was O
, O
um O
, O
a O
little O
worried O
, O
so O
she O
went O
to O
visit O
them O
. O

She O
went O
to O
visit O
them O
. O

When O
she O
saw O
them O
, O
, O
the O
girl O
cried O
to O
her O
and O
said O
, O
" O
I O
really O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
stay O
here O
. O

I O
want O
to O
go O
home O
. O
" O

Later O
, O
the O
mother O
was O
moved O
and O
brought O
, O
this O
girl O
home O
and O
had O
the O
grandparents O
look O
after O
her O
. O

Um O
, O
she O
still O
, O
ai O
, O
left O
him O
at O
the O
martial O
arts O
school O
. O

Um O
, O
um O
, O
after O
the O
girl O
returned O
, O
the O
mother O
continued O
to O
work O
in O
the O
city O
. O

When O
she O
came O
back O
one B-CARDINAL
time O
in O
between O
work O
, O
she O
found O
that O
the O
girl O
's O
body O
was O
dotted O
with O
red O
marks O
and O
red O
swellings O
. O

She O
then O
discovered O
ah O
, O
um O
, O
the O
grandparents O
had O
not O
washed O
her O
clothes O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time O
. O

The O
situation O
you O
mentioned O
, O
is O
it O
common O
or O
is O
it O
a O
rather O
extreme O
example O
, O
because O
generally O
, O
people O
will O
think O
that O
grandparents O
will O
particularly O
love O
and O
care O
about O
their O
grandchildren O
? O

The O
situation O
that O
I O
just O
mentioned O
regarding O
skip O
- O
generation O
custody O
is O
no O
doubt O
common O
. O

Why O
is O
it O
so O
? O

You O
said O
that O
grandparents O
certainly O
have O
special O
love O
for O
the O
children O
. O

It O
is O
true O
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
they O
will O
go O
out O
of O
their O
way O
to O
pamper O
the O
children O
. O

However O
, O
for O
the O
elderly O
, O
with O
the O
difference O
in O
age O
and O
time O
, O
, O
their O
, O
ways O
of O
taking O
care O
and O
loving O
the O
children O
are O
different O
. O

They O
are O
influenced O
by O
their O
own O
habits O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
there O
was O
a O
child O
who O
was O
sick O
. O

Um O
, O
the O
grandparents O
asked O
him O
to O
take O
, O
a O
small O
pill O
that O
was O
made O
in O
Shaanxi B-GPE
. O

They O
did O
not O
even O
know O
what O
it O
was O
made O
of O
. O

It O
was O
a O
local O
method O
. O

Um O
, O
after O
all O
, O
they O
are O
different O
from O
, O
um O
, O
young O
people O
in O
this O
respect O
. O

Instead O
of O
sending O
the O
child O
to O
the O
hospital O
as O
quickly O
as O
possible O
, O
they O
are O
influenced O
by O
, O
some O
habits O
in O
this O
aspect O
. O

, O
they O
raised O
this O
point O
themselves O
. O

Another O
important O
point O
they O
mentioned O
was O
that O
they O
had O
to O
take O
care O
of O
the O
entire O
family O
. O

" O
Her O
father O
and O
mother O
are O
not O
home O
, O
so O
the O
entire O
family O
falls O
onto O
our O
shoulders O
, O
especially O
when O
we O
still O
have O
to O
be O
responsible O
for O
the O
farm O
work O
on O
the O
farmland O
. O

So O
, O
all O
I O
can O
do O
is O
to O
feed O
her O
and O
make O
sure O
that O
she O
is O
not O
cold O
. O
" O

They O
also O
had O
to O
face O
such O
a O
reality O
, O
one O
that O
they O
could O
not O
resolve O
. O

After O
all O
, O
a O
family O
that O
had O
so O
many O
people O
in O
the O
beginning O
, O
, O
the O
parents O
of O
the O
children O
were O
a O
very O
important O
um O
, O
workforce O
. O

Now O
it O
was O
down O
to O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
grandparents O
. O

No O
doubt O
, O
they O
could O
not O
help O
. O

In O
the O
study O
of O
left O
- O
behind O
children O
, O
many O
staff O
found O
out O
by O
surprise O
that O
the O
biological O
cycle O
of O
the O
farmers O
who O
work O
in O
the O
city O
, O
and O
the O
inculcation O
and O
upbringing O
cycle O
of O
their O
children O
, O
have O
formed O
two B-CARDINAL
parallel O
lines O
that O
will O
never O
meet O
. O

Farmers O
who O
work O
in O
the O
city O
are O
generally O
a O
young O
workforce O
in O
their O
prime O
, O
while O
this O
is O
the O
period O
in O
which O
their O
children O
attend O
primary O
or O
junior O
high O
school O
. O

Originally O
, O
they O
work O
in O
the O
city O
out O
of O
the O
hope O
that O
their O
children O
can O
receive O
a O
better O
education O
. O

However O
, O
adolescent O
children O
need O
the O
loving O
care O
and O
guidance O
of O
their O
parents O
even O
more O
. O

During O
this O
period O
, O
the O
absence O
of O
both O
or O
even O
one O
parent O
will O
create O
obstacles O
to O
the O
character O
development O
of O
the O
children O
. O

This O
pair O
of O
unavoidable O
contradictions O
has O
made O
the O
problem O
of O
left O
- O
behind O
children O
in O
rural O
areas O
become O
more O
obvious O
. O

You O
have O
seen O
many O
kinds O
of O
left O
- O
behind O
children O
. O

Was O
there O
a O
particular O
case O
or O
a O
particular O
child O
who O
had O
left O
an O
especially O
deep O
impression O
on O
you O
that O
you O
still O
remember O
now O
? O

, O
um O
, O
there O
was O
a O
child O
in O
Ningxia B-GPE
whose O
name O
was O
Yao B-PERSON
Zhengang I-PERSON
. O

This O
child O
, O
um O
, O
did O
not O
do O
exceptionally O
well O
in O
school O
. O

What O
impressed O
me O
the O
most O
about O
him O
was O
that O
he O
really O
missed O
his O
parents O
. O

He O
felt O
particularly O
lonely O
and O
especially O
wanted O
his O
father O
to O
come O
back O
. O

He O
said O
that O
he O
was O
sick O
one B-CARDINAL
time O
. O

His O
father O
worked O
in O
Guyuan B-GPE
, O
about O
40 B-QUANTITY
to I-QUANTITY
50 I-QUANTITY
kilometers I-QUANTITY
away O
from O
home O
. O

After O
his O
father O
learned O
that O
he O
was O
very O
sick O
, O
he O
ran O
back O
to O
the O
village O
right O
away O
. O

After O
he O
arrived O
at O
the O
village O
, O
he O
did O
not O
say O
anything O
, O
but O
to O
put O
him O
on O
his O
back O
and O
carry O
him O
to O
the O
town O
to O
see O
a O
doctor O
. O

He O
just O
carried O
him O
like O
that O
without O
saying O
a O
word O
. O

When O
the O
doctor O
in O
the O
town O
took O
a O
look O
and O
told O
him O
that O
they O
were O
unable O
to O
cure O
the O
sickness O
, O
he O
carried O
the O
child O
to O
the O
county O
. O

When O
Yao B-PERSON
Zhengang I-PERSON
told O
us O
what O
happened O
, O
he O
said O
, O
" O
My O
father O
had O
never O
bought O
me O
so O
many O
tasty O
foods O
before O
. O

On O
that B-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
he O
bought O
me O
a O
lot O
of O
tasty O
food O
while O
we O
were O
in O
the O
county O
, O
but O
he O
did O
not O
eat O
any O
himself O
. O
" O

I O
thought O
about O
this O
at O
that O
time O
. O

After O
I O
heard O
this O
incident O
, O
I O
particularly O
understood O
what O
was O
in O
the O
mind O
of O
Yao B-PERSON
Zhengang I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
father O
. O

He O
might O
have O
felt O
especially O
guilty O
toward O
his O
child O
. O

What O
he O
felt O
was O
that O
" O
I O
go O
out O
to O
work O
and O
leave O
my O
child O
home O
. O
" O

He O
said O
that O
his O
child O
had O
also O
said O
, O
" O
When O
he O
was O
at O
home O
, O
he O
always O
encouraged O
me O
. O
" O

He O
would O
say O
, O
" O
No O
problem O
. O
You O
work O
hard O
and O
get O
a O
better O
grade O
next O
time O
, O
" O
when O
I O
had O
low O
grades O
. O

If O
he O
could O
receive O
many O
, O
such O
encouragements O
, O
he O
would O
not O
have O
um O
, O
um O
, O
disliked O
school O
sometimes O
. O

He O
does O
not O
want O
to O
go O
to O
school O
now O
. O

However O
, O
in O
his O
example O
, O
I O
could O
imagine O
what O
went O
through O
his O
father O
's O
mind O
at O
that O
time O
. O

I O
think O
that O
he O
felt O
very O
guilty O
toward O
his O
child O
. O

Therefore O
, O
I O
can O
feel O
that O
um O
, O
um O
, O
parents O
who O
work O
in O
the O
city O
also O
have O
no O
alternative O
. O

They O
are O
forced O
into O
making O
such O
decisions O
. O

Um O
, O
there O
was O
also O
this O
child O
. O

There O
was O
a O
child O
, O
a O
girl O
in O
Xixiang B-GPE
county I-GPE
, O
Shaanxi B-GPE
province I-GPE
. O

Um O
, O
when O
I O
asked O
, O
" O
What O
do O
you O
think O
are O
the O
changes O
that O
your O
parents O
working O
in O
the O
city O
have O
caused O
you O
? O
" O
She O
did O
not O
answer O
. O

She O
went O
home O
to O
get O
a O
small O
box O
. O

There O
was O
a O
small O
finger O
inside O
the O
box O
. O

This O
was O
a O
very O
terrifying O
incident O
. O

What O
was O
the O
small O
finger O
all O
about O
? O

What O
happened O
was O
that O
when O
her O
um O
, O
parents O
left O
to O
work O
in O
the O
city O
, O
her O
grandparents O
looked O
after O
her O
. O

They O
had O
a O
cellar O
at O
home O
and O
inside O
was O
a O
hay O
cutter O
for O
cutting O
hay O
. O

When O
she O
went O
downstairs O
to O
play O
by O
herself O
, O
an O
accident O
happened O
. O

Her O
grandparents O
said O
, O
" O
We O
ca O
n't O
help O
. O

We O
ca O
n't O
keep O
an O
eye O
on O
her O
all O
the O
time O
. O
" O

, O
before O
they O
went O
to O
work O
in O
the O
city O
, O
they O
could O
watch O
her O
and O
forbade O
her O
to O
go O
down O
to O
the O
cellar O
. O

He O
had O
told O
her O
not O
to O
do O
that O
before O
. O

However O
, O
I O
said O
that O
sometimes O
it O
is O
very O
difficult O
to O
ask O
children O
to O
have O
self O
control O
. O

That O
was O
why O
she O
turned O
this O
way O

We O

He O
was O
only O
eight B-DATE

at O
that O

The O
only O
connection O
that O
little O
Beiwen B-PERSON
has O
with O
his O
parents O
now O
is O
to O
talk O
on O
the O
phone O
with O
them O
once O
a O
week O
. O

In O
his O
opinion O
, O
affection O
among O
family O
members O
is O
something O
unreachable O
. O

How O
often O
can O
your O
mother O
call O
you O
? O

Uh O
, O
once O
a O
week O
! O

What O
do O
you O
talk O
about O
? O

I O
will O
talk O
about O
my O
studies O
and O
life O
. O

My O
schoolwork O
was O
not O
quite O
good O
when O
I O
first B-ORDINAL
came O
! O

My O
mother O
scolded O
me O
in O
the O
beginning O
when O
my O
schoolwork O
was O
poor O
. O

She O
said O
that O
I O
was O
losing O
honor O
for O
not O
doing O
well O
at O
school O
! O

Then O
I O
cried O
and O
after O
that O
, O
my O
mother O
cried O
, O
too O
. O

Since O
they O
move O
from O
place O
to O
place O
in O
the O
city O
to O
work O
all O
year O
round O
, O
parents O
of O
left O
- O
behind O
children O
have O
little O
communication O
with O
their O
children O
. O

While O
for O
temporary O
custodians O
, O
they O
are O
only O
limited O
to O
providing O
superficial O
care O
, O
such O
as O
making O
sure O
the O
children O
have O
food O
and O
stay O
warm O
, O
but O
can O
not O
fulfill O
the O
responsibility O
of O
educating O
the O
children O
. O

The O
survey O
found O
that O
36.7 B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
of O
the O
children O
had O
never O
been O
to O
their O
parents O
' O
workplace O
. O

8.2 B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
of O
the O
parents O
almost O
never O
contacted O
their O
children O
. O

21.4 B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
of O
the O
parents O
contacted O
their O
children O
less O
than O
once O
a O
month O
. O

Since O
their O
parents O
are O
absent O
, O
how O
can O
these O
children O
communicate O
and O
exchange O
with O
their O
parents O
? O

Our O
study O
found O
that O
um O
, O
um O
, O
the O
principal O
means O
of O
contact O
between O
the O
left O
- O
behind O
children O
and O
their O
parents O
was O
through O
the O
telephone O
. O

However O
, O
contrary O
to O
our O
belief O
that O
they O
could O
talk O
on O
the O
phone O
for O
a O
long O
time O
when O
they O
called O
, O
approximately B-PERCENT
50 I-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
of O
the O
left O
- O
behind O
children O
we O
surveyed O
talked O
on O
the O
phone O
with O
their O
parents O
for O
three B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
or O
so O
. O

What O
could O
they O
talk O
about O
in O
three B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
? O

I O
think O
it O
is O
hard O
to O
say O
anything O
meaningful O
in O
three B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
. O

Of O
course O
, O
we O
also O
studied O
what O
these O
children O
talked O
to O
their O
parents O
about O
in O
these O
three B-TIME
- I-TIME
minute I-TIME
telephone O
conversations O
. O

What O
did O
the O
parents O
who O
worked O
in O
the O
city O
talk O
about O
with O
their O
children O
? O

What O
touched O
us O
very O
deeply O
was O
that O
70 B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
of O
the O
content O
of O
the O
children O
's O
conversations O
with O
their O
parents O
was O
to O
ask O
about O
their O
safety O
and O
not O
other O
things O
, O
such O
as O
how O
much O
they O
had O
earned O
. O

As O
for O
the O
content O
of O
the O
parents O
' O
conversations O
with O
their O
children O
, O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
it O
was O
school O
. O

Whether O
they O
were O
good O
and O
how O
their O
schoolwork O
was O
. O

Second B-ORDINAL
, O
it O
was O
whether O
they O
obeyed O
their O
custodians O
and O
what O
they O
ate O
and O
things O
like O
that O
. O

Uh O
, O
as O
for O
safety O
matters O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
they O
could O
not O
have O
any O
emotional O
exchange O
. O

We O
know O
that O
sometimes O
when O
we O
talk O
on O
the O
phone O
, O
even O
a O
pause O
is O
a O
need O
for O
emotional O
exchange O
. O

However O
, O
the O
parents O
may O
not O
have O
realized O
this O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
the O
child O
has O
stopped O
talking O
. O

He O
stops O
talking O
because O
he O
needs O
to O
pause O
to O
consider O
how O
to O
say O
what O
is O
in O
his O
mind O
. O

The O
parents O
may O
not O
have O
realized O
this O
point O
, O
so O
they O
hang O
up O
the O
phone O
immediately O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
for O
three B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
, O
why O
was O
it O
only O
for O
three B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
? O

In O
many O
cases O
, O
it O
was O
because O
they O
worried O
about O
the O
charge O
. O

, O
many O
left O
- O
behind O
children O
told O
us O
that O
they O
especially O
wanted O
to O
call O
their O
parents O
on O
the O
phone O
. O

However O
, O
um O
, O
they O
considered O
that O
um O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
, O
sometimes O
they O
did O
not O
have O
a O
telephone O
at O
home O
. O

It O
was O
very O
difficult O
for O
children O
to O
borrow O
the O
phone O
from O
their O
neighbors O
. O

Second B-ORDINAL
, O
um O
, O
they O
considered O
that O
they O
needed O
money O
to O
make O
a O
phone O
call O
. O

Some O
children O
told O
me O
, O
" O
I O
secretly O
called O
my O
parents O
when O
my O
custodians O
were O
not O
home O
. O
" O

The O
children O
have O
a O
great O
need O
for O
this O
type O
of O
telephone O
exchange O
. O

Do O
the O
left O
- O
behind O
children O
understand O
why O
their O
parents O
work O
in O
the O
city O
? O

Um O
, O
um O
, O
we O
conducted O
a O
survey O
on O
this O
question O
. O

We O
were O
very O
surprised O
to O
find O
that O
40 B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
of O
the O
left O
- O
behind O
children O
had O
no O
idea O
what O
jobs O
their O
parents O
held O
away O
from O
home O
. O

How O
could O
that O
be O
possible O
? O

How O
could O
that O
be O
possible O
? O

We O
interviewed O
some O
left O
- O
behind O
children O
, O
their O
custodians O
, O
and O
the O
people O
who O
work O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Why O
would O
n't O
the O
children O
know O
what O
they O
did O
? O

First B-ORDINAL
, O
we O
can O
tell O
from O
the O
content O
of O
the O
three B-TIME
- I-TIME
minute I-TIME
telephone O
conversations O
we O
mentioned O
earlier O
that O
children O
are O
particularly O
concerned O
about O
the O
safety O
of O
the O
parents O
who O
work O
in O
the O
city O
. O

However O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
work O
that O
the O
parents O
engaged O
in O
is O
dangerous O
work O
, O
including O
coalmines O
, O
construction O
, O
and O
some O
others O
, O
many O
of O
them O
are O
dangerous O
jobs O
. O

Thus O
, O
I O
believe O
the O
parents O
of O
these O
left O
- O
behind O
children O
also O
choose O
not O
to O
take O
the O
initiative O
and O
tell O
them O
the O
nature O
of O
their O
job O
. O

Why O
do O
they O
do O
that O
? O

It O
is O
because O
they O
are O
afraid O
that O
their O
children O
will O
worry O
. O

Second B-ORDINAL
, O
, O
parents O
, O
especially O
fathers O
, O
who O
work O
in O
the O
city O
have O
a O
particularly O
lofty O
image O
in O
the O
children O
's O
mind O
. O

Maybe O
they O
do O
not O
want O
their O
children O
to O
know O
about O
the O
nature O
of O
their O
job O
or O
tell O
them O
what O
they O
do O
. O

They O
, O
do O
not O
want O
to O
destroy O
the O
lofty O
image O
of O
themselves O
in O
the O
child O
's O
mind O
. O

At O
noon B-TIME
, O
the O
maternal O
grandmother O
and O
maternal O
grandfather O
went O
to O
work O
in O
the O
field O
and O
did O
not O
come O
home O

Jiang B-PERSON

has O
to O

This O
happens O
to O
him O
very O
often O

He O
could O
look O

What O

are O
you O
going O

do O
today B-DATE

other O

cooking O

Uh O

I O
will O

the O

I O

If O
it O
is O
Sunday B-DATE

I O
am O

I O
will O

Uh O

I O
will O

uh O

when O
we O
are O
in O
a O

the O

I O
will O
help O

Do O
you O
still O
remember O
your O

cooking O

Uh O
huh O
, O
I O
do O
. O

It O
was O

Now O
, O
the O
most O
I O
want O
to O
know O
is O

my O
parents O

health O
. O

Why O
do O
you O
want O
to O
know O
about O
that O
? O

It O
is O
because O
I O
care O
about O
my O
parents O
very O
much O
. O

I O
think O
about O
their O
work O
because O
I O
know O
that O
they O
work O
in O
the O
city O
because O
of O
me O
, O
so O
I O
care O
about O
them O
a O
lot O
. O

They O
will O
be O
worn O
out O
from O
working O
in O
the O
city O
, O
working O
in O
the O
city O
to O
make O
money O
. O

I O
believe O
it O
is O
also O
because O
of O
me O
, O
so O
I O
care O
about O
their O
health O
a O
lot O
. O

Because O
of O
you O
, O
why O
is O
it O
because O
of O
you O
? O

Because O
if O
they O
did O
n't O
have O
me O
, O
I O
think O
they O
uh O
, O
would O
be O
a O
lot O
more O
, O
relaxed O
when O
they O
worked O
. O

Then O
, O
are O
these O
children O
willing O
to O
live O
with O
their O
parents O
? O
Or O
go O
to O
the O
city O
with O
them O
? O

In O
regard O
to O
this O
, O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
, O
children O
all O
want O
their O
parents O
to O
come O
back O
to O
live O
with O
them O
. O

However O
, O
51 B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
of O
the O
children O
we O
surveyed O
were O
unwilling O
to O
go O
to O
the O
city O
with O
their O
parents O
, O
go O
to O
the O
city O
, O
to O
live O
in O
the O
city O
. O

However O
, O
they O
all O
wanted O
their O
parents O
to O
come O
back O
, O
but O
half B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
children O
did O
not O
want O
to O
go O
to O
the O
city O
. O

We O
also O
asked O
them O
why O
they O
did O
not O
want O
to O
go O
to O
the O
city O
. O

This O
was O
also O
very O
surprising O
to O
us O
. O

They O
said O
that O
the O
city O
is O
another O
world O
and O
they O
were O
especially O
worried O
. O

They O
were O
afraid O
that O
once O
they O
go O
to O
the O
city O
, O
they O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
assimilate O
into O
the O
schools O
and O
things O
like O
that O
. O

Second B-ORDINAL
, O
they O
realized O
that O
it O
is O
already O
a O
very O
difficult O
task O
for O
their O
parents O
to O
work O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Their O
parents O
have O
to O
send O
money O
home O
, O
among O
other O
things O
. O

If O
they O
go O
live O
with O
them O
, O
they O
will O
add O
more O
burdens O
to O
their O
parents O
. O

If O
we O
are O
in O
the O
city O
every O
day O
, O
live O
in O
the O
city O
every O
day O
, O
we O
may O
know O
that O
oh O
, O
city O
life O
is O
like O
this O
. O

As O
for O
children O
from O
rural O
areas O
and O
people O
from O
rural O
areas O
who O
work O
in O
the O
city O
, O
they O
are O
not O
familiar O
with O
this O
world O
and O
they O
have O
a O
type O
of O
fear O
. O

As O
for O
parents O
, O
are O
they O
more O
willing O
to O
bring O
their O
children O
with O
them O
or O
leave O
them O
at O
home O
? O

I O
believe O
when O
parents O
make O
this O
decision O
, O
their O
main O
consideration O
is O
not O
willing O
or O
unwilling O
. O

All O
parents O
, O
I O
can O
say O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
parents O
, O
definitely O
want O
to O
live O
with O
their O
children O
. O

However O
, O
with O
the O
reality O
that O
they O
have O
to O
face O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
they O
can O
not O
solve O
this O
problem O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
we O
know O
what O
the O
reality O
is O
. O

First B-ORDINAL
, O
their O
families O
are O
rather O
poor O
to O
begin O
with O
. O

Only O
the O
lower O
- O
middle O
class O
will O
leave O
the O
rural O
areas O
and O
work O
in O
the O
city O
. O

They O
have O
to O
make O
money O
to O
support O
the O
family O
. O

They O
will O
need O
a O
huge O
sum O
of O
money O
in O
order O
to O
bring O
their O
children O
to O
the O
city O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
I O
believe O
there O
are O
also O
many O
other O
reasons O
. O

They O
also O
have O
to O
consider O
whether O
their O
children O
can O
go O
to O
school O
in O
the O
city O
. O

They O
have O
to O
find O
a O
place O
to O
live O
. O

All O
these O
are O
problems O
that O
they O
need O
to O
resolve O
. O

The O
problems O
they O
face O
are O
too O
many O
. O

If O
the O
children O
go O
to O
the O
city O
, O
the O
expenses O
will O
be O
very O
high O
. O

Since O
circumstances O
do O
not O
permit O
, O
they O
can O
not O
bring O
their O
children O
with O
them O
, O
according O
to O
their O
will O
or O
their O
psychological O
need O
. O

Many O
parents O
are O
unable O
to O
bring O
their O
children O
with O
them O
. O

What O
would O
you O
tell O
your O
parents O
if O
you O
could O
see O
them O
now O
? O

I O
want O
to O
tell O
them O
that O
I O
miss O
them O
very O
much O
. O

Judging O
from O
the O
surface O
, O
is O
there O
any O
obvious O
difference O
between O
the O
character O
of O
these O
left O
- O
behind O
children O
and O
non-left O
- O
behind O
children O
? O

It O
is O
hard O
to O
tell O
from O
the O
surface O
. O

Why O
is O
it O
so O
? O

For O
these O
children O
, O
it O
depends O
on O
how O
long O
their O
parents O
have O
been O
working O
in O
the O
city O
. O

For O
example O
, O
some O
have O
just O
gone O
for O
a B-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
while O
others O
have O
gone O
for O
10 B-DATE
years I-DATE
already O
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
um O
, O
generally O
speaking O
, O
uh O
, O
we O
did O
not O
conduct O
any O
psychological O
testing O
or O
comparison O
in O
this O
psychological O
aspect O
. O

However O
, O
many O
schools O
and O
custodians O
reported O
that O
many O
left O
- O
behind O
children O
had O
become O
very O
withdrawn O
. O

They O
had O
very O
strange O
um O
, O
um O
, O
temperaments O
. O

They O
did O
not O
like O
to O
speak O
. O

There O
was O
, O
a O
child O
who O
was O
in O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
year I-DATE
of O
junior O
high O
school O
. O

Um O
, O
um O
, O
he O
told O
us O
himself O
that O
he O
particularly O
, O
um O
, O
um O
, O
misses O
his O
father O
. O

He O
was O
very O
good O
at O
school O
. O

However O
, O
one O
time O
we O
visited O
him O
, O
his O
um O
, O
family O
told O
us O
that O
he O
was O
second B-ORDINAL
in O
his O
class O
in O
his O
examination O
. O

After O
that O
, O
he O
became O
extremely O
, O
extremely O
, O
annoyed O
. O

Um O
, O
um O
, O
um O
, O
his O
language O
and O
other O
things O
became O
very O
strange O
. O

Um O
, O
um O
, O
we O
also O
asked O
his O
um O
, O
um O
, O
grandparents O
who O
had O
custody O
of O
him O
. O

They O
said O
that O
when O
his O
father O
was O
home O
, O
he O
would O
always O
encourage O
him O
and O
um O
, O
exchange O
with O
him O
. O

Um O
, O
of O
course O
, O
it O
was O
not O
necessarily O
because O
his O
parents O
worked O
in O
the O
city O
. O

However O
, O
for O
some O
left O
- O
behind O
children O
, O
their O
parents O
working O
in O
the O
city O
has O
caused O
some O
psychological O
abnormalities O
and O
unusual O
development O
. O

This O
situation O
indeed O
exists O
. O

After O
all O
, O
these O
are O
families O
whose O
love O
is O
inadequate O
and O
incomplete O
. O

I O
believe O
love O
is O
especially O
important O
. O

Children O
need O
love O
from O
the O
time O
they O
are O
small O
. O

We O
have O
to O
understand O
our O
Chinese B-NORP
saying O
, O
" O
The O
child O
is O
father O
to O
the O
man O
. O
" O

What O
it O
says O
is O
that O
the O
character O
that O
children O
form O
at O
a O
very O
young O
age O
will O
affect O
their O
entire O
life O
. O

Only O
children O
who O
are O
loved O
and O
who O
realize O
the O
importance O
of O
love O
since O
they O
are O
young O
will O
be O
able O
to O
love O
other O
people O
in O
the O
future O
. O

This O
is O
the O
case O
. O

Therefore O
, O
for O
this O
type O
, O
um O
, O
um O
, O
um O
, O
this O
group O
of O
left O
- O
behind O
children O
, O
psychologically O
, O
they O
do O
not O
have O
family O
love O
. O

Um O
, O
, O
if O
the O
parents O
work O
in O
the O
city O
, O
these O
children O
perhaps O
will O
not O
receive O
timely O
attention O
when O
they O
encounter O
many O
difficulties O
at O
home O
. O

Perhaps O
the O
neighbors O
around O
are O
all O
facing O
different O
realities O
and O
can O
not O
offer O
them O
timely O
love O
. O

Under O
this O
situation O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
I O
am O
not O
sure O
, O
um O
, O
I O
am O
unwilling O
to O
imagine O
what O
mentality O
and O
character O
these O
children O
will O
develop O
when O
they O
grow O
up O
. O

Will O
they O
believe O
there O
is O
love O
in O
society O
or O
not O
? O

Will O
they O
think O
that O
love O
is O
important O
in O
society O
or O
not O
, O
because O
they O
have O
never O
experienced O
it O
. O

They O
have O
never O
completely O
experienced O
it O
. O

Thus O
, O
if O
such O
a O
large O
group O
in O
society O
does O
not O
realize O
that O
love O
should O
be O
, O
um O
, O
given O
or O
received O
in O
society O
, O
I O
think O
this O
is O
, O
something O
that O
I O
do O
not O
want O
to O
imagine O
. O

Despite O
the O
guarantee O
in O
food O
, O
clothing O
, O
and O
school O
that O
left O
- O
behind O
children O
get O
because O
their O
parents O
work O
in O
the O
city O
to O
make O
money O
, O
they O
do O
not O
have O
the O
psychological O
and O
physiological O
satisfaction O
that O
they O
require O
. O

According O
to O
the O
survey O
, O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
half I-CARDINAL
of O
the O
left O
- O
behind O
children O
were O
dissatisfied O
with O
their O
current O
life O
. O

58 B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
of O
the O
left O
- O
behind O
children O
believed O
that O
they O
were O
unhappy O
. O

Are O
the O
parents O
worried O
about O
leaving O
their O
children O
at O
home O
by O
themselves O
? O

Do O
they O
understand O
the O
living O
conditions O
of O
their O
children O
at O
home O
? O

They O
thought O
that O
this O
was O
a O
reality O
that O
they O
could O
not O
um O
, O
um O
, O
face O
. O

They O
were O
condemned O
to O
this O
reality O
. O

No O
doubt O
, O
I O
think O
some O
, O
um O
, O
parents O
have O
not O
had O
such O
profound O
consideration O
. O

Why O
do O
n't O
they O
? O

I O
believe O
people O
are O
all O
the O
same O
. O

If O
they O
face O
such O
an O
urgent O
need O
for O
a O
livelihood O
, O
their O
first B-ORDINAL
consideration O
will O
be O
the O
need O
for O
a O
livelihood O
. O

They O
can O
not O
consider O
the O
deeper O
issue O
of O
children O
's O
safety O
and O
psychology O
when O
their O
livelihood O
has O
not O
been O
solved O
, O
satisfied O
, O
and O
guaranteed O
. O

For O
example O
, O
there O
were O
two B-CARDINAL
sisters O
who O
lived O
in O
a O
cave O
dwelling O
in O
Shaanxi B-GPE
province I-GPE
. O

Many O
people O
whom O
we O
interviewed O
lived O
in O
cave O
dwellings O
. O

Once O
there O
was O
a O
flood O
. O

, O
these O
sisters O
stayed O
in O
the O
cave O
dwelling O
to O
look O
after O
the O
home O
! O

This O
happened O
in O
the O
rural O
area O
. O

These O
two B-CARDINAL
children O
were O
looking O
after O
the O
home O
. O

Their O
uncle O
saved O
them O
when O
the O
flood O
was O
almost O
past O
their O
bellies O
. O

Their O
father O
called O
later O
to O
see O
if O
they O
were O
fine O
. O

The O
family O
told O
him O
that O
they O
were O
fine O
. O

He O
did O
not O
come O
back O
after O
that O
. O

He O
did O
not O
come O
back O
to O
check O
if O
everything O
was O
fine O
. O

I O
believe O
the O
reason O
he O
did O
not O
return O
was O
that O
he O
would O
ponder O
whether O
he O
should O
return O
or O
not O
. O
