the O

We O
learned O
from O
John B-PERSON
King I-PERSON
, O
traveling O
with O
the O
President O
, O
that O
the O
new O

will O

neither O
by O
U.S. B-GPE
/ O
British B-NORP
coalition O
or O
United B-ORG

, O
but O
by O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
people O
. O

That O
some O
of O
what O
the O
Prime O
Minister O

President O
shared O
with O
reporters O
at O
news O
conference O
following O
their O

. O

The O
President O
went O
on O

say O
that O
an O
interim O
authority O
composed O
of O
Iraq B-GPE
GRS O
inside O

outside O
the O

will O
run O

Do O

They O
really O

any O

what O
the O

They O
said O
there O
will O
definitely O
be O
some O
kind O
of O
role O
for O
the B-ORG
United I-ORG

. O

They O
think O
it O

very O
important O
for O
the O
European B-NORP
nations O
to O
be O
on O

once O

The O

you O

The O

Qusay B-PERSON

a O

pulled O

I O
thought O

horrible O
scene O
. O

General O
Brooks B-PERSON
talking O
about O
three B-CARDINAL
major O
points O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
is O
the O
capture O
of O
number O
24 B-CARDINAL
as O
it O
's O
described O
, O
Samir B-PERSON
who O
is O
responsible O
for O
the O
Baghdad B-GPE
district O
. O

Indications O
are O
the O
Kurds B-NORP
in O
the O
north O
handed O
this O
man O
over O
so O
this O
is O
number O
4 B-CARDINAL
out O
of O
that O
playing O
card O
deck O
of O
55 B-CARDINAL
that O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
is O
after O
, O
top O
leaders O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

Also O
that O
bomb O
site O
in O
Baghdad B-GPE
hit O
about B-DATE
a I-DATE
week I-DATE
and I-DATE
a I-DATE
half I-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
the O
Mansour B-GPE
district O
. O

No O
remains O
identified O
just O
yet O
, O
General O
Brooks B-PERSON
says O
, O
but O
only O
the O
initial O
surveys O
have O
been O
completed O
so O
far O
. O

There O
is O
strong O
speculation O
that O
his O
two B-CARDINAL
sons O
were O
inside O
of O
that O
building O
when O
it O
was O
hit O
by O
coalition O
bombs O
, O
or O
may O
have O
left O
prior O
to O
the O
bombing O
taking O
place O
. O

Again O
, O
all O
this O
is O
an O
outstanding O
issue O
right O
now O
. O

In O
the O
north O
, O
you O
're O
going O
to O
hear O
a O
lot O
about O
the O
shallow O
graves O
today O
. O

At B-CARDINAL
least I-CARDINAL
1500 I-CARDINAL
, O
maybe O
1600 B-CARDINAL
graves O
located O
in O
the O
north O
. O

you O

Good O

you O

That O
's O
what O
happens O
when O
you O
sell O
books O
. O

I O
know O
. O

Let O
's O
talk O
about O
what O
Barbara B-PERSON
Starr I-PERSON
was O
reporting O
from O
the O
Pentagon B-FAC
. O

She O
says O
there O
is O
an O
acknowledgment O
from O
those O
officials O
that O
there O
are O
not O
enough O
ground O
troops O
in O
place O
and O
particularly O
in O
Baghdad B-GPE
to O
control O
what O
our O
Nic B-PERSON
Robertson I-PERSON
is O
saying O
is O
a O
stage O
of O
anarchy O
in O
some O
parts O
of O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

Do O
you O
think O
the O
administration O
underestimated O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
after I-DATE
? O

because O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
after I-DATE
came O
so O
fast O
and O
so O
suddenly O
in O
a O
way O
, O
I O
think O
that O
there O
's O
been O
a O
pattern O
here O
not O
just O
with O
this O
administration O
, O
but O
over O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
ten I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
Bosnia B-GPE
, O
Kosovo B-GPE
, O
Afghanistan B-GPE
, O
where O
we O
do O
n't O
quite O
recognize O
when O
the O
old O
order O
collapses O
, O
you O
very O
quickly O
have O
to O
rush O
in O
and O
fill O
it O
with O
some O
kind O
of O
new O
order O
. O

In O
the O
short O
term O
, O
that O
's O
going O
to O
have O
to O
mean O
the O
American B-NORP
military O
, O
but O
the O
key O
question O
, O
which O
I O
try O
to O
address O
in O
the O
book O
, O
is O
What O
do O
you O
do O
after O
that O
? O
What O
kind O
of O
authority O
do O
you O
create O
in O
a O
society O
going O
through O
this O
kind O
of O
transition O
. O

And O
how O
do O
you O
know O
that O
the O
local O
Iraqi B-NORP
citizens O
will O
make O
up O
this O
government O
or O
are O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
interested O
in O
democracy O
? O

There O
's O
no O
proof O
of O
that O
. O

Well O
, O
the O
key O
here O
is O
the O
only O
way O
to O
get O
that O
kind O
of O
legitimate O
government O
to O
have O
it O
look O
good O
is O
to O
hold O
elections O
, O
but O
if O
you O
hold O
elections O
, O
you O
stop O
the O
whole O
process O
of O
building O
a O
rule O
of O
law O
, O
creating O
courts O
, O
creating O
administration O
. O

We O
've O
seen O
in O
the O
past O
in O
Bosnia B-GPE
for O
example O
, O
you O
held O
elections O
and O
all O
of O
the O
old O
ethnic O
thugs O
get O
into O
power O
because O
they O
have O
organization O
and O
they O
have O
money O
and O
they O
stop O
the O
process O
of O
genuine O
building O
of O
democracy O
. O

There O
is O
this O
tension O
here O
which O
is O
the O
only O
way O
to O
make O
this O
look O
good O
is O
in O
some O
way O
get O
legitimate O
Iraqi B-NORP
authority O
, O
but O
the O
faster O
you O
get O
that O
, O
the O
more O
likely O
you O
stop O
this O
process O
. O

So O
what O
do O
you O
think O
of O
this O
interim O
government O
? O

You O
got O
Deputy O
Defense B-ORG
Secretary O
Paul B-PERSON
Wolfowitz I-PERSON
saying O
that O
American B-NORP
and O
British B-NORP
military O
forces O
would O
play O
a O
leading O
role O
in O
setting O
up O
an O
Iraqi B-NORP
government O
and O
then O
later O
draw O
civilians O
into O
the O
process O
. O

Is O
that O
going O
to O
work O
? O

I O
think O
it O
will O
work O
if O
it O
's O
truly O
broad O
- O
based O
and O
truly O
consensual O
, O
try O
and O
include O
all O
different O
people O
and O
including O
them O
in O
creating O
a O
constitution O
which O
would O
take O
a O
few O
years O
. O

What O
I O
point O
out O
is O
the O
places O
where O
you O
've O
had O
quick O
transitions O
-- O

You O
've O
heard O
the O
old O
saying O
, O
the O
best O
offense O
is O
a O
good O
defense O
? O

Perhaps O
with O
that O
in O
mind O
, O
the O
nation O
's O
threat O
level O
back O
at O
orange O
, O
or O
high O
, O
to O
discourage O
and O
thwart O
potential O
terrorist O
attacks O
. O

What O
does O
this O
mean O
if O
you O
're O
traveling O
you O
might O
ask O
. O

To O
CNN B-ORG
's O

National I-FAC

What O
are O

to O
do O
and O
, O
for O
that O
matter O
, O
not O
to O
do O
? O

Reporter O

Miles B-PERSON

what O
that O
means O
is O
tighter O
security O
at O

across O

, O

that O

potentially O
slow O

Reporter O
: O

The O
findings O
are O
heightening O
concerns O
among O
coalition O
forces O
approaching O
Baghdad B-GPE
since O
, O
as O
the O
Iraqis B-NORP
should O
know O
, O
U.S. B-GPE
and O
British B-NORP
forces O
do O
not O
use O
chemical O
weapons O

U.S. B-GPE
officials O
say O
some O
intelligence O
indicates O
a O
red O
line O

been O
drawn O
around O
the O
capital O

Republican B-ORG

suggesting O
Republican B-ORG

have O
been O

There O
has O

who O
knows O
how O
accurate O
they O
are O

chatter O
in O

that O
suggests O
that O
the O
closer O
that O
coalition O

get O
to O
Baghdad B-GPE
and O
Tikrit B-GPE
the O
greater O
the O
likelihood O

that O
some O

it O

not O

any O

of O

When O

we O

we O
always O
knew O

Reporter O
: O

Experts O
say O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON

forces O
will O
likely O
try O

hoping O
to O
build O
international O
pressure O
on O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
and O
Britain B-GPE
to O
back O
down O

In O
that O
sense O
any O
use O
of O
chemical O
weapons O
would O
be O
counterproductive O
to O
Saddam B-PERSON

because O
it O

The O

we O

a O

what O
some O

a O

does O
not O
seem O

be O
directed O
by O
one O

from O
the O

and O
that O
raises O
questions O
, O
questions O
that O

in O

of O
us O
since O
that O
first B-ORDINAL

perhaps O
his O

That O

somewhat O

If O

you O

We O

How O
many O

In O

we O

13 B-CARDINAL
major O

here O
attaching O
East B-GPE
Baghdad I-GPE
to O
West B-GPE
Baghdad I-GPE
and O
the O

This O
is O
one O
technique O
, O
one O
possible O
way O
U.S. B-GPE
forces O
might O
seize O
a O
bridge O
, O
a O
bridge O
that O
might O
be O
defended O
by O
Iraqis B-NORP
. O

Let O
's O
look O
at O
the O
animation O

Typical O
scenario O
there O

It O
does O
n't O
really O
matter O
for O
this O
scenario O
that O
we O
're O
laying O
out O
here O

This O
would O
be O
representing O
M1 B-PRODUCT

A1 I-PRODUCT
tanks O
coming O
towards O
the O
bridge O
firing O
. O

You O
have O
to O
bundle O
up O
and O
line O
up O
to O
go O
across O
that O
bridge O
. O

Makes O
it O
vulnerable O
to O
fire O
from O
the O
other O
side O
. O

Potentially O
chemical O
weapons O
, O
too O
. O

As O
we O
turn O
the O
other O
direction O
, O
what O
you O
'll O
see O
are O
these O
Iraqi B-NORP
tanks O
that O
are O
kind O
of O
fortified O
there O
. O

They O
have O
burns O
in O
front O
of O
them O
, O
artillery O
behind O
them O
firing O
back O
. O

there O
goes O
the O
smoke O
screen O
. O

The O
idea O
of O
the O
smoke O
screen O
is O
to O
obscure O
the O
oncoming O
forces O
firing O
at O
you O
from O
being O
able O
to O
see O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
work O

though O
. O

It O
works O
both O
ways O
. O

It O
obscures O
you O
but O
also O
obscures O
them O

Here O
's O
an O
f O

He O
comes O
in O

wants O
to O
identify O

We O

some O

show O
you O

Somewhere O
near O
we O
can O
put O
down O
special O

Back O
to O
something O
Kelly B-PERSON

She O
was O

the O
somewhat O

the O

The B-ORG

The O

as O
an O
afterthought O
, O
citizens O

It O
gives O
you O
a O
sense O

perhaps O
what O
50 B-DATE
years I-DATE
of O
tension O

war O
will O
do O
to O
your O

but O
it O
does O
also O
say O
that O
the O
Israelis B-NORP

a O

more O
blase O

if O
that O

President O

John B-PERSON

So O
even O
at O
the O
very O
early O
stages O
of O
a O
defining O
moment O
of O
Bush B-PERSON
presidency O
, O
the O
President O
trying O
to O
make O
the O
case O
his O
eyes O
and O
especially O
the O
eyes O
of O
his O
cabinet O
still O
on O
the O
domestic O
affairs O
of O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
as O
the O
early O
prosecution O
of O
the O
war O
continues O
. O

One O
thing O
the O
President O
said O
that O
will O
be O
the O
point O
of O
contention O
around O
the O
world O
, O
the O
President O
called O
it O
an O
ever O
- O
growing O
coalition O
of O
40 B-CARDINAL
countries O
. O

That O
is O
handful O
more O
nations O
that O
were O
actively O
involved O
in O
the O
coalition O
his O
father O
assembled O
12 O
years O
ago O
for O
the B-EVENT
Persian I-EVENT
Gulf I-EVENT
War I-EVENT
, O
but O
there O
is O
a O
significant O
difference O
, O
of O
course O
. O

In O
this O
coalition O
, O
it O
is O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
doing O
the O
overwhelming O
load O
of O
the O
fighting O
. O

British B-NORP
forces O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
Australian B-NORP
troops O
scheduled O
to O
take O
part O
, O
perhaps O
in O
some O
way O
. O

In O
the O
last O
Gulf B-EVENT

, O
you O
had O
Arab B-NORP

, O
the O

ABC O

the O
President O
says O
, O
This O
is O
a O
growing O
coalition O
, O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
big O
geopolitical O
debates O
going O
on O
around O
the O
world O
as O
the O
President O
-- O

Seven B-CARDINAL

Once O

the O

Doctors O

the O
six B-CARDINAL

one B-CARDINAL

so O
they O

They O

Medical O

yesterday B-DATE
the O
threat O

The O

bring O
terror O
to O

Other O

this O

They O

You O

You O
had O
unprecedented O

the O

How O
vulnerable O
do O
we O
continue O
to O
be O
? O

Well O
, O
quite O
vulnerable O
in O
some O
places O
and O
yet O
we O
've O
made O
great O
strides O

The O
access O
I O
had O
was O
not O
only O
at O

the O
people O
who O
were O
on O

this O

everything O
they O

I O
think O
we O
decided O
on O
the B-TIME
morning I-TIME
of O
September B-DATE
12th I-DATE
we O
're O
not O
going O

we O
have O
taken O
all O

but O
we O
are O
vulnerable O

We O
're O
vulnerable O
right O
out O
on O
the O
streets O
here O
. O

We O
're O
vulnerable O
in O
mass O

because O
we O
ca O

infinitely O

We O
've O

They O
'll O
be O

They O
'll O
also O

for O
Israeli B-NORP

They O
also O
want O
to O
review O
what O
the O
status O
is O
of O
Northern B-GPE
Ireland I-GPE
right O
now O
as O
that O
peace O
process O
seems O
to O
be O
taking O

Been O
relatively O
quiet O
in O
Northern B-GPE
Ireland I-GPE
over O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
few I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

This O
is O
the O
third B-ORDINAL
time O
in O
as B-DATE
many I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
that O
President O
Bush B-PERSON
and O
Prime O

will O

sitting O

war O

go O
forward O

close O
allies O
in O
trying O
to O
help O
put O
together O
a O
new O
Iraq B-GPE

There O
are O
some O
significant O
differences O
in O
their O
strategy O
, O
including O
what O
role O
precisely O
the B-ORG
United I-ORG
Nations I-ORG
should O
have O
in O
determining O
the O
future O
of O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

They O
'll O
try O
to O
thrash O
all O
of O
that O
out O
. O

You O
're O
looking O
at O
the O
picture O
of O
Air B-PRODUCT
Force I-PRODUCT
One I-PRODUCT
taxiing O
in O
on O
the O
tarmac O
, O
getting O
ready O
for O
the O
President O

As O
we O
watched O
this O
picture O
of O
the B-PRODUCT
Air I-PRODUCT
Force I-PRODUCT
One I-PRODUCT
getting O
into O
this O
airport O
I O
want O
to O
bring O
in O
our O
military O
analyst O
General O
Dan B-PERSON
Crisman I-PERSON
to O
go O
over O
what O
is O
happening O
in O
Baghdad B-GPE
. O

Seems O
pretty O
far O
away O
from O
Belfast B-GPE
right O
now O
, O
General O
, O
but O
decisions O
that O
these O
two B-CARDINAL
leaders O
make O
could O
have O
a O
significant O
impact O
on O
the O
future O
of O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

First B-ORDINAL
of O
all O
, O
General O
, O
we O
'll O
keep O
this O
picture O
up O
of O
Air B-PRODUCT
Force I-PRODUCT
One I-PRODUCT
, O
talk O
about O
what O
you O
sense O
is O
happening O
on O
the O
streets O
of O
Baghdad B-GPE
right O
now O
. O

Wolf B-PERSON
, O
it O
's O
clearly O
the O
final O
phase O
, O
the O
endgame O
which O
is O
unfolding O
right O
now O
. O

I O
think O
it O
's O
very O
significant O
not O
only O
in O
Baghdad B-GPE
but O
Basra B-GPE
itself O
. O

You O
have O
coalition O
forces O
there O
in O
some O
strength O
. O

Apparently O
three B-CARDINAL
battalians O
of O
the B-ORG
U.S. I-ORG
3rd I-ORG
Division I-ORG
in O
Baghdad B-GPE
three B-CARDINAL
coalition O
assets O
, O
three B-CARDINAL
huge O
battle O
groups O
in O
Basra B-GPE
itself O
which O
the O
U.K. B-GPE
has O
there O
. O

What O
they O
've O
developed O
here O
, O
Wolf B-PERSON
, O
over O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
several I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
is O
very O
clear O
and O
increasingly O
clear O
intelligence O
as O
to O
what O
the O
final O
remnants O
of O
the O
regime O
leadership O
are O
in O
terms O
of O
where O
they O
are O
embedded O
in O
the O
cities O
. O

What O
they O
're O
doing O
is O
going O
in O
now O
, O
very O
carefully O
, O
obviously O
some O
symbolic O
raids O
against O
palaces O
, O
but O
the O
more O
important O
presence O
is O
to O
go O
after O
what O
intelligence O
delivers O
and O
that O
's O
where O
these O
key O
leaders O
are O
located O
. O

They O
're O
going O
to O
be O
defended O
fanatically O
but O
intelligence O
is O
so O
crucial O
from O
aerial O
platforms O
and O
special O
ops O
personnel O
to O
give O
the O
three B-CARDINAL
assets O
the O
intel O
which O
they O
need O
to O
close O
with O
and O
eliminate O
final O
remnants O
of O
the O
regime O
in O
those O
citys O
. O

This O
is O
a O
very O
important O
final O
phase O
here O
, O
Wolf B-PERSON
, O
and O
it O
looks O
like O
the O
closure O
is O
coming O
here O
now O
more O
rapidly O
than O
we O
anticipated O
. O

As O
we O
continue O
to O
watch O
Air B-PRODUCT
Force I-PRODUCT
One I-PRODUCT
, O
now O
on O
the O
ground O
outside O
Belfast B-GPE
, O
Northern B-GPE
Ireland I-GPE
, O
we O
'll O
be O
watching O
President O
Bush B-PERSON
emerge O
from O
the O
plane O
momentarily O
. O

We O
'll O
continue O
to O
have O
live O
coverage O
of O
that O
. O

When O
Walter B-PERSON
Rodgers I-PERSON
, O
our O
embedded O

with O

3rd I-ORG

says O
three B-CARDINAL
battalions O
of O
troops O
are O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
inside O
Baghdad B-GPE
itself O
, O
have O
taken O
up O
positions O
they O
're O
going O
to O
spend O
the B-TIME
night I-TIME
there O
presumably O
, O
how O
many O

are O
we O
talking O
about O
right O
now O
? O

The O

probably O
built O
around O

It O

a O

heavy O

It O

and O
some O
may O
remember O
the O
story O
of O
Leon B-PERSON
Clinghover I-PERSON
. O

He O
was O
in O
a O
wheelchair O
and O
the O
terrorists O
shot O
him O
and O
pushed O
him O
over O
the O
side O
of O
the O
ship O
into O
the O
Mediterranean B-LOC
where O
he O
obviously O
, O
died O
. O

This O
man O
, O
Abu B-PERSON
Abbas I-PERSON
has O
lived O
an O
itinerant O
life O
, O
he O
's O
been O
in O
Tunas B-GPE
, O
he O
's O
been O
in O
Libya B-GPE
and O
he O
's O
been O
living O
under O
the O
protection O
of O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
in O
Baghdad B-GPE
, O
but O
he O
is O
wanted O
for O
murder O
in O
Italy B-GPE
. O

There O
are O
, O
U.S. B-GPE
charges O
which O
have O
expired O
but O
could O
, O
I O
am O
told O
, O
possibly O
be O
restarted O
for O
piracy O
, O
hostage O
taking O
and O
conspiracy O
. O

So O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
oldest O
cases O
of O
terrorism O
that O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
oldest O

There O

a O
significant O

A O
family O

$ O
40,000 B-MONEY
would O
receive O
a O
96 B-PERCENT

. O

Instead O

Applause O

That O
means O
extra O
money O
in O
the O
family O
budget O
year O

. O

That O
money O
can O
cover O

That O

can O
help O

That O

which O
will O

good O
for O
our O

Applause O

And O
this O
plan O
will O
help O
our O
small O
business O
sector O
. O

The O
benefits O
of O
the O
growth O
plan O
will O
come O
from O
increased O
consumer O
spending O
and O
, O
as O
importantly O
, O
from O
a O
lower O
income O
tax O
rates O
on O
the O
small O
businesses O
themselves O
. O

It O
is O
important O
for O
our O
fellow O
citizens O
to O
understand O
that O
most O
small O
businesses O
pay O
their O
business O
taxes O
at O
the O
individual O
rates O
. O

Most O
small O
businesses O
are O
sole O
proprietorships O
, O
limited O
partnerships O
, O
are O
subchapter O
SS O
, O
and O
, O
therefore O
, O
when O
you O
reduce O
individual O
tax O
rates O
, O
you O
benefit O
small O
business O
formation O
. O

As O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
under O
this O
plan O
, O
some B-CARDINAL
23 I-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
small O
business O
owners O
will O
see O
their O
taxes O
cut O
, O
which O
leaves O
more O
money O
for O
investment O
, O
more O
money O
for O
growth O
, O
more O
money O
for O
job O
creation O
. O

A O
growing O
economy O
also O
needs O
small O
business O
investment O
, O
and O
our O
tax O
code O
should O
encourage O
investment O
. O

Today B-DATE
a O
small O
business O
can O
deduct O
a O
maximum O
of O
$ O
25,000 B-MONEY
in O
the B-DATE
year I-DATE
in O
which O
they O
buy O
equipment O
. O

We O
need O
to O
triple O
the O
amount O
that O
can O
be O
deducted O
in O
the B-DATE
year I-DATE
in O
which O
they O
buy O
equipment O
. O

Applause O

So O
I O
propose O
to O
Congress B-ORG
that O
limit O
ought O
to O
be O
increased O
to O
$ O
75,000 B-MONEY
and O
that O
limit O
ought O
to O
be O
indexed O
to O
inflation O
. O

By O
doing O
so O
, O
we O
promote O
greater O
investment O
in O
machinery O
, O
and O
when O
a O
small O
business O
buys O
machine O
that O
enhances O
their O
company O
's O
productivity O
as O
well O
as O
it O
means O
machinery O
manufacturer O
is O
likely O
to O
have O
more O
work O
available O
. O

More O
investment O
equals O
jobs O
, O
and O
what O
we O
are O
interested O
in O
in O
this O
administration O
is O
helping O
people O
who O
look O
for O
work O
find O
a O
job O
. O

Applause O

We O
can O
also O
promote O
economic O
growth O
and O
job O
creation O
by O
removing O
the O
double O
tax O
on O
dividends O
. O

Applause O

Taxing O
corporate O
income O
once O
is O
fair O
. O

It O
is O
not O
fair O
for O
the O
federal O
government O
to O
tax O
the O
same O
money O
twice O
. O

The O
burden O
of O
double O
taxation O
falls O
on O
the O
millions B-CARDINAL
of O
individuals O
who O
receive O
dividends O
, O
falls O
especially O
hard O
on O
seniors O
who O
receive O
half B-CARDINAL
of O
all O
dividend O
income O
. O

Removal O
of O
double O
taxation O
would O
put O
more O
money O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
investors O
. O

It O
would O
encourage O
more O
investment O
in O
American B-NORP
businesses O
. O

Economists O
say O
that O
this O
plan O
will O
help O
our O
stock O
markets O
, O
and O
since O
half B-CARDINAL
of O
American B-NORP
families O
own O
stock O
, O
the O
reform O
will O
help O
them O
save O
and O
help O
our O
economy O
grow O
. O

Now O
, O
these O
measures O
were O
presented O
to O
Congress B-ORG
in O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
week I-DATE
of I-DATE
this I-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

The O
pro-growth O
package O
was O
urgent O
in O
January B-DATE
. O

It O
's O
even O
more O
urgent O
today B-DATE
. O

Applause O

It O
is O
important O
for O
you O
all O
to O
understand O
and O
for O
our O
fellow O
Americans B-NORP
to O
understand O
the O
tax O
relief O
that O
I O
have O
proposed O
and O
will O
push O
for O
until O
enacted O
applause O
will O
create O
1.4 B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
new O
jobs O
by O
the B-DATE
end I-DATE
of I-DATE
2004 I-DATE
. O

In O
two B-DATE
years I-DATE
time O
, O
this O
nation O
has O
experienced O
war O
, O
a O
recession O
and O
a O
national O
emergency O
, O
which O
has O
caused O
our O
government O
to O
run O
a O
deficit O
. O

The O
best O
way O
to O
reduce O
the O
deficit O
is O
with O
more O
growth O
in O
our O
economy O
, O
which O
means O
more O
revenues O
to O
our O
treasury O
, O
and O
less O
spending O
in O
Washington B-GPE
, I-GPE
D.C I-GPE

applause O

I O
am O
pleased O
that O
both O
the O
House B-ORG
and O
Senate B-ORG
have O
passed O
budget O
resolutions O
that O
show O
real O
spending O
restraint O
, O
and O
now O
the O
Congress B-ORG
must O
focus O
on O
a O
robust O
and O
effective O
growth O
package O
. O

We O
need O
at B-MONEY
least I-MONEY
$ I-MONEY
550 I-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
in O
that O
package O
because O
the O
more O
tax O
relief O
that O
goes O
to O
the O
American B-NORP
people O
, O
the O
more O

we O
will O
create O
in O
this O

. O

Reporter O
: O

Well O
, O
Lou B-PERSON
, O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
that O
the O
coroner O
has O
been O
able O
to O
determine O
is O
that O
the O
skeletal O
remains O
are O
those O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
, O
an O
adult O
female O
, O
and O
two B-CARDINAL
, O
the O
remains O
of O
the O
almost O
full O
- O
term O
baby O
boy O
, O
and O
of O
course O
, O
this O
is O
significant O
because O
Laci B-PERSON
Peterson I-PERSON
, O
when O
she O
disappeared O
from O
her O
Modesto B-GPE
home O
, O
was O
7 B-DATE
1 I-DATE
/ I-DATE
2 I-DATE
months I-DATE
pregnant O
. O

That O
was O
on O
Christmas B-DATE
Eve I-DATE
. O

Her O
husband O
, O
Scott B-PERSON
, O
at O
the O
time O
said O
that O
he O
was O
fishing O
in O
the O
Berkeley B-GPE
marina O
. O

Now O
, O
in O
a O
strange O
twist O
in O
all O
of O
this O
, O
just B-DATE
yesterday I-DATE
separate O
from O
the O
skeletal O
remains O
I O
alluded O
to O
earlier O
a O
man O
hiking O
near O
the O
Berkeley B-GPE
marina O
found O
a O
bone O
, O
and O
they O
are O
now O
looking O
at O
that O
as O
another O
possible O
lead O
in O
this O
case O
. O

This O
person O
came O
across O
the O
bone O
at O
the O
shore O
. O

He O
brought O
it O
home O
and O
contacted O
the O
authorities O
, O
and O
we O
took O
possession O
of O
it O
. O

And O
you O
're O
trying O
to O
connect O
it O
to O
the O
other O
-- O

Well O
, O
we O
're O
trying O
to O
find O
out O
if O
it O
's O
a O
human O
bone O
and O
whether O
or O
not O
it O
is O
related O
to O
the O
others O
. O

Reporter O
: O

And O
yet O
another O
reason O
why O
that O
bone O
could O
be O
a O
key O
link O
, O
there O
are O
reports O
that O
have O
surfaced O
that O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
female O
remains O
that O
were O
found O
the O
skeleton O
was O
not O
completely O
intact O
. O

Now O
this O
case O
is O
also O
taking O
on O
, O
we O
should O
say O
, O
almost O
a O
TV O
episodic O
forensic O
pathology O
angle O
because O
they O
're O
going O
to O
bring O
in O
an O
expert O
on O
what O
's O
called O
alufating O
decay O
, O
and O
basically O
this O
person O
is O
going O
to O
come O
in O
here O
and O
look O
at O
the O
body O
. O

This O
is O
in O
the O
damage O
aspect O
of O
it O
. O

And O
they O
say O
these O
experts O
will O
be O
able O
to O
tell O
how O
long O
the O
body O
had O
been O
in O
there O
and O
if O
the O
remains O
of O
the O
almost O
full O
- O
term O
baby O
boy O
were O
inside O
the O
female O
's O
remains O
at O
the O
time O
of O
death O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
coroner O
could O
know O
right O
now O
but O
is O
not O
saying O
if O
there O
was O
some O
sort O
of O
trauma O
to O
either O
of O
these O
skeletons O
. O

For O
example O
, O
if O
they O
could O
see O
the O
bone O
compromised O
in O
some O
way O
they O
could O
tell O
if O
there O
had O
been O
a O
stab O
or O
a O
shooting O
. O

We O
may O
learn O
a O
lot O
more O
on O
this O
in O
just B-TIME
15 I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
. O

That O
's O
because O
Modesto B-GPE
police O
have O
scheduled O
a O
news O
conference O
and O
while O
they O
may O
not O
say O
much O
at O
all O
they O
could O
also O
drop O
some O
major O
bomb O
shells O

Paul B-PERSON

let O
me O
ask O
you O
, O
if O
I O
may O
, O
quickly O
, O
is O
there O
any O
reason O
for O
us O
to O
expect O
that O
there O
would O
be O
the O
ability O
to O
identify O
those O
remains O
as O
a O
result O
of O
these O
autopsies O
this B-TIME
afternoon I-TIME
? O

Reporter O
: O

It O
sounds O
like O
all O
of O
this O
will O
be O
too O
quick O
, O
and O
it O
seems O
underlying O
all O
this O
is O
there O
could O
be O
an O
absence O
of O
dental O
records O
. O

That O
's O
particularly O
important O
for O
the O
adult O
female O
remains O
. O

So O
now O
they O
're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
turn O
to O
DNA O
, O
and O
that O
's O
why O
they O
're O
calling O
in O
these O
experts O

Some O
DNA O
testing O
can O
be O
very O

Hi O

Michele B-PERSON

Hi O
, O
Chuck B-PERSON
. O

, O
the O
Bush B-PERSON
cabinet O
do O
you O
think O
it O
will O
be O
diverse O
and O
will O
he O
reach O
out O
to O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
aisle O
? O

He O
's O
saying O
that O
he O
will O
, O
but O
this O
may O
be O
an O
impossible O
task O
, O
not O
because O
he O
is O
n't O
interested O
in O
appointing O
Democrats B-NORP
, O
but O
because O
the O
word O
has O
gone O
out O
not O
to O
accept O
a O
position O
. O

Now O
, O
this O
, O
of O
course O
, O
is O
part O
of O
their O
tactic O
to O
try O
to O
regain O
control O
of O
the O
House B-ORG
and O
Senate B-ORG
in O
2002 B-DATE
and O
2004 B-DATE
. O

It O
may O
be O
not O
Bush B-PERSON
's O
fault O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
see O
any O
of O
the O
Democratic B-NORP
faces O
around O
the O
table O
. O

It O
's O
not O
for O
want O
on O
his O
part O
. O

So O
there O
is O
word O
among O
Democrats B-NORP
not O
to O
accept O
a O
cabinet O
post O
? O

Yes O
. O

How O
can O
they O
make O
everybody O
fall O
into O
line O
on O
that O
? O

It O
's O
easy O
. O

You O
want O
the O
campaign O
funds O
when O
you O
run O
in O
2002 B-DATE
? O

It O
's O
fairly O
easy O
to O
put O
pressure O
like O
that O
on O
Democrats B-NORP
. O

There O
might O
be O
rogue O
Democrats B-NORP
who O
is O
more O
conservative O
that O
really O
does O
n't O
care O
and O
is O
interested O
in O
serving O
in O
a O
Cabinet O
post O
. O

That O
may O
be O
where O
he O
finds O
the O
best O
luck O
. O

He O
's O
probably O
going O
to O
appoint O
two B-CARDINAL
prominant O
African B-NORP
- I-NORP
Americans I-NORP
, O
Rice B-PERSON
and O
Powell B-PERSON
. O

Any O
other O
outreach O
to O
the O
black O
community O
? O

I O
think O
those O
are O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
main O
appointees O
and O
the O
glittering O
stars O
in O
the O
crown O
. O

That O
's O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
his O
way O
in O
reaching O
out O
to O
the O
black O
community O
which O
feels O
more O
than O
alienated O
after O
this O
election O
if O
some O
of O
the O
leaders O
are O
to O
be O
believed O
. O

Is O
there O
a O
risk O
if O
he O
becomes O
a O
centrist O

does O
he O
risk O
alienating O
the O
hard O

Jim B-PERSON

takes O

Ask O
passengers O
what O
they O
think O
of O
the O
air O
they O
're O
breathing O
aboard O
a O
plane O
, O
and O
you O
may O
get O
answers O
similar O
to O
these O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
a O
safe O
or O
healthy O
quality O
of O
air O
. O

It O
's O
of O
low O
quality O
, O
because O
it O
's O
been O
recirculated O
and O
recirculated O

Very O
frequent O
complaint O

They O
call O
us O
, O
they O
have O
a O
little O
fever O
, O
perhaps O
, O
sinus O
congestion O
cold O
. O

There O
is O
a O
pervasive O
belief O
that O
the O
air O
on O
planes O
is O
teaming O
with O
dangerous O
microorganisms O
, O
but O
that O
has O
never O
been O
scientifically O
proven O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
the O
air O
in O
your O
own O
home O
could O
be O
dirtier O
than O
what O
you O
're O
breathing O
on O
the O
plane O
. O

Possible O
because O
the O
fresh O
air O
pulled O
in O
during O
flight O
may O
be O
less O
polluted O
than O
the O
air O
closer O
to O
the O
ground O
, O
and O
though O
a O
portion O
of O
the O
air O
on O
planes O
is O
recirculated O
, O
it O
must O
pass O
through O
very O
restrictive O
filters O
. O

These O
are O
called O
high O

efficiency O
particulate O
air O
filters O
. O

These O
filters O
screen O
out O
very O

very O

very O
fine O
particles O

Particles O
such O
as O
viruses O

But O
powerful O
as O
those O

they O
ca O
n't O
remedy O
everything O

There O
is O
no O

that O
is O
going O

protect O
you O

the O

It O

a O

Thomas B-PERSON

that O
story O

When O
Fidel B-PERSON
Castro I-PERSON
and O
his O
rebels O
stormed O
Havana B-GPE
, O
they O
were O
joined O
by O
an O
intrepid O
American B-NORP
photographer O
who O
spoke O
little O
Spanish B-LANGUAGE
. O

His O
name O
is O
Burt B-PERSON
Glinn I-PERSON
, O
and O
now O
most O
Cubans B-NORP
are O
getting O
their O
first O
look O
at O
his O
photos O
on O
display O
in O
Havana B-GPE
until O
the O
end O
of O
the O

The O
collection O
is O
called O
`` O

Some O
of O
the O
other O
photographers O
that O
were O
there O
had O
to O
go O
back O
to O
their O
newspapers O
and O
had O
to O
go O
back O
to O
their O
offices O
to O
send O
their O
film O
in O
, O
but O
I O
stayed O
because O
, O
to O
me O
, O
it O
was O
more O
than O
a O
news O
event O
. O

It O
was O
about O
history O
, O
so O
I O
wanted O
the O
whole O
story O
. O

Capturing O
the O
whole O
story O
was O
not O
easy O
. O

Glinn B-PERSON
borrowed O
money O
from O
friends O
just O
to O
get O
to O
Cuba B-GPE
, O
and O
had O
to O
shoot O
many O
of O
the O
photos O
barefoot O
after O
he O
lost O
his O
shoes O
while O
being O
pushed O
in O
a O
crowd O
. O

The O
resulting O
photos O
show O
the O
passion O
of O
the O
Cuban B-NORP
people O
and O
the O
charisma O
of O
their O
new O
leader O
, O
standing O
at O
the O
center O
of O
it O
all O
, O
just O
as O
he O
is O
42 O
years O
later O
. O

Glinn B-PERSON
is O
75 B-DATE
now O
-- O
about O
the O
same O
age O
as O
Castro B-PERSON
-- O
and O
this O
is O
his O
second B-ORDINAL
trip O
back O
to O
Cuba B-PERSON
since O
the O
revolution O
. O

When O
he O
looks O
back O
at O
his O
long O
career O
, O
including O
stints O
in O
South B-GPE
Africa I-GPE
and O
the O
former O
Soviet B-GPE
Union I-GPE
, O
one B-CARDINAL
assignment O
stands O
out O
, O
and O
this O
was O
the O
most O
exciting O
, O
because O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
not O
a O
story O
about O
Fidel B-PERSON
Castro I-PERSON
. O

It O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
story O
about O
the O
Cuban B-NORP
people O
, O
and O
how O
they O
received O
the O
revolution O
, O
and O
it O
's O
so O
important O
, O
because O
the O
visions O
that O
foreigners O
have O
-- O
particularly O
Americans B-NORP
-- O
about O
the O
revolution O
are O
completely O
different O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
understand O
the O
kind O
of O
popular O
joy O
that O
was O
here O
. O

While O
some O
might O
disagree O
about O
Cuba B-GPE
's O
present O
, O
and O
plot O
different O
courses O
for O
its O
future O
, O
these O

Stewart B-PERSON

found O
the O

I O
think O
the O

The O
goal O
had O

There O

a O
reason O

the O

that O
she O

a O

who O
now O

Her O
defense O
has O

that O

when O
the O

The O
broker O
standing O
by O
that O

The O
only O
reason O
it O

because O
there O

the B-ORG

the O

from O

taken O
a O
tremendous O
toll O

Martha B-PERSON
Stewart I-PERSON
told O
me O
that O
the O

itself O
had O
cost O
her O
about B-MONEY

400 I-MONEY
million I-MONEY

in O

Ironic O

less B-MONEY

50,000 I-MONEY

She O
'll O
never O
fully O
recover O

You O
know O

almost O
like O
e.g. O
you O
get O
off O

hook O

but O
are O
you O
really O
off O
the O
hook O
because O
people O
always O
believe O
you O
were O
guilty O

And O
it O

hard O

win O
back O
that O
sort O

equity O
that O
she O

lost O

Reporter O

Stewart B-PERSON
is O
vowing O
to O
clear O
her O
name O
of O
the O

She O
is O
so O
focused O

so O
determined O
that O
this O
investigation O

terribly O

not O

something O
that O

He O
says O
Stewart B-PERSON
is O
still O
taken O
aback O
by O
the O
reaction O
to O
her O
legal O
troubles O

I O
think O

been O
stunned O
at O
how O
much O
joy O
so O
many O
people O
have O
taken O
at O
her O
misfortune O

She O
does O

quite O

that O
the O

say O

Oh O
, O
is O

it O

see O
someone O

Martha B-PERSON
does O
n't O
like O

about O
how O
unpleasant O
things O
have O
been O

but O
you O
can O
get O
signals O

it O
in O

ways O

When O
we O
sat O
down O
to O
lunch O
, O
she O
had O
put O
out O
these O
beautiful O
chop O

which O
I O
commented O
on O

She O
said O
, O
in O
China B-GPE
, O
the O

with O
the O
thinnest O
chop O
sticks O
has O
the O
highest O

of O

I O
had O
to O
get O
the O

Then O
she O
paused O

said O
, O
That O

why O

The O

on O
a O

near O
the O
Afghan B-NORP

The O
Pentagon B-ORG
says O
the O

was O
Taliban B-ORG

There O
was O
an O

Reporter O

But O
the O
strikes O
prove O
controversial O

Local O
Afghans B-NORP
in O
the O

say O
it O
was O
a O

to O
the O
inaugural O
ceremony O
for O
interim O
Afghan B-NORP
leader O

Analysts O
believe O
some O

have O
taken O

firepower O
by O
accusing O

leaders O
of O

The O

very O

Our O

Ted B-PERSON
Turner I-PERSON

has O
sold O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
half I-CARDINAL

stake O

AOL B-ORG
Time I-ORG

That O

a O

Andy B-PERSON

you O

now O

Chitchat O
in O

Building I-FAC
here O
at O
AOL B-ORG
and O
all O
over O
Wall B-FAC

, O
Ted B-PERSON
Turner I-PERSON
selling O
60 B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
shares O
for O
$ B-MONEY
800 I-MONEY
million I-MONEY

more B-CARDINAL

in O
the O

He O
opens O
40 B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
plus I-CARDINAL
now O
. O

Question O
is O
, O
Why O
? O
Why O
is O
he O
selling O
? O

I O
think O
, O
he O
's O
at O
least O
-- O
hedging O
his O
bets O
by O
keeping O
40 B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
shares O
but O
basically O
he O
's O
decided O
that O
the O
company O
is O
not O
going O
where O
he O
wants O
it O
to O
go O
and O
he O
's O
bailing O
out O
. O

You O
know O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
concern O
obviously O
by O
people O
who O
still O
own O
the O
stock O
. O

My O
point O
about O
this O
, O
if O
Ted B-PERSON
Turner I-PERSON
were O
so O
smart O
and O
he O
's O
a O
very O
smart O
guy O
but O
he O
did O
not O
sell O
at O
the O
top O
, O
okay O
? O

He O
did O
n't O
sell O
at O
$ O
60 B-MONEY
. O

Hind O
sight O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
have O
gotten O
that O
. O

He O
believed O
in O
the O
merger O
like O
most O
other O
people O
did O
. O

We O
'll O
look O
back O
five B-DATE
years I-DATE
from O
now O
, O
you O
can O
see O
, O
he O
has O
lost O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
. O

You O
know O
, O
He O
still O
had O
$ B-MONEY
1.7 I-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
, O
we O
're O
not O
shedding O
tears O
. O

He O
did O
have O
$ B-MONEY
8 I-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
. O

He O
's O
left O
a O
lot O
on O
the O
table O
. O

We O
'll O
look O
back O
five B-DATE
years I-DATE
from O
now O
, O
when O
the O
stock O
is O
either O
at O
$ B-MONEY
13 I-MONEY
still O
or O
$ B-MONEY
8 I-MONEY
or O
$ B-MONEY
30 I-MONEY
and O
say O
, O
he O
was O
either O
very O
smart O
or O
not O
smart O
at O
all O
. O

He O
's O
still O
hedging O
his O
bet O
by O
keeping O
40 B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
stake O
. O

I O
hope O
he O
's O
wrong O
. O

Me O
, O
too O
. O

The O
question O
, O
I O
'm O
an O
AOL B-ORG
shareholder O
sitting O
at O
home O
, O
hearing O
this O
news O
, O
Does O
this O
set O
off O
a O
few O
alarms O
? O
Will O
people O
panic O
and O
everybody O
sell O
it O
? O

I O
think O
the O

will O
be O
weaker O
today B-DATE
. O

Again O
, O
you O
know O
, O
the O

has O
drifted O
below O
$ O
10 B-MONEY

It O
's O
been O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
for O
a O
while O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
see O
the O
thing O
going O
down O
a O
lot O
. O

Interesting O
point O
here O
also O
, O
people O
are O
suggesting O
he O
may O
be O
raising O
this O
money O
to O
buy O
those O
Atlanta B-GPE
sports O
teams O
that O
apparently O
are O
on O
the O
block O
. O

The O
Braves B-ORG
and O
Thrashers B-ORG
. O

You O
really O
think O
? O

You O
know O
, O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
. O

apparently O
they O
're O
for O
sale O
. O

We O
'll O
have O
to O
see O
about O
that O
. O

That O

support O
his O

will O

with O
them O
but O
how O
long O
will O
he O
? O

We O
could O
find O
out O
today B-DATE
. O

His O
punishment O
, O
suspension O
for O
using O
a O
corked O
bat O
which O
is O
illegal O
during O
a O
game O
. O

Since O
the O
incident O
33,000 B-CARDINAL
fans O
in O
the O
stands O
for O
a O
night O
game O
he O
received O
a O
standing O
ovation O
from O
almost O
all O
of O
them O
. O

I O
heard O
a O
few O
boos O
but O
almost O
everyone O
standing O
. O

Not O
everyone O
believing O
this O
man O
's O
story O
, O
which O
is O
it O
was O
a O
mistake O
but O
he O
's O
a O
hero O
here O
. O

These O
people O
want O
to O
believe O
his O
story O
. O

It O
happened O
Tuesday B-TIME
night I-TIME
. O

In O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
inning O
he O
hit O
a O
ground O
ball O
, O
scored O
a O
run O
. O

When O
he O
hit O
the O
ball O
, O
the O
bat O
broke O
. O

The O
umpires O
found O
cork O
in O
the O
bat O
. O

It O
's O
illegal O
because O
when O
you O
put O
it O
in O
the O
bat O
it O
makes O
the O
bat O
lighter O
. O

They O
hollow O
out O
the O
bat O
and O
stick O
the O
cork O
in O
there O
to O
mask O
the O
hollow O
sound O
. O

Then O
you O
can O
swing O
it O
lighter O
and O
you O
can O
swing O
it O
faster O
. O

They O
took O
76 B-CARDINAL
of O
his O
bats O
for O
analysis O
. O

They O
x-rayed O
the O
bats O
. O

The O
x-rays O
all O
came O
back O
negative O
. O

But O
did O
Major B-ORG
League I-ORG
Baseball I-ORG
have O
all O
of O
Sammy B-PERSON
Sosa I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
bats O
? O

We O
are O
, O
as O
I O
said O
, O
confident O
, O
based O
on O
not O
only O
the O
presence O
of O
security O
in O
the O
club O
house O
but O
also O
the O
level O
of O
cooperation O
, O
the O
record O
keeping O
that O
we O
reviewed O
and O
so O
forth O
, O
that O
we O
have O
all O
of O
the O
bats O
. O

So O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
anyone O
to O
misconstrue O
what O
I O
said O
. O

It O
is O
conceivable O
because O
we O
did O
n't O
have O
physical O
presence O
in O
the O
club O
house O
that O
we O
do O
not O
have O
them O
all O
but O
we O
are O
very O
confident O
that O
we O
do O
. O

I O
'm O
man O
enough O
to O
take O
everything O
that O
I O
've O
done O
for O
, O
and O
I O
still O
walk O
yesterday B-DATE
like O
a O
man O
and O
take O
the O
blame O
, O
but O
the O
media O
today B-DATE
, O
they O
got O
it O
like O
I O
'm O
a O
criminal O
and O
that O
's O
something O
that O
really O
bothered O

He O

James B-PERSON

So O
, O
again O

to O

exactly O
what O
happened O
we O
need O
a O
full O

inquiry O

The O
Israeli B-NORP

said O
its O

were O
returning O

that O
Miller B-PERSON

suggesting O

Those O

We O

we O

This O
is O
very O
worrying O

I O
believe O
the B-ORG
Israeli I-ORG

should O
take O
special O
measures O
to O
prevent O
this O

The O
message O
from O
the O
Israeli B-NORP
government O
is O
that O
its O
soldiers O
are O
not O
targeting O
journalists O
, O
but O
that O
journalists O
who O
travel O

places O
where O
there O
could O
be O
live O
fire O
exchange O
between O
Israeli B-NORP
forces O

Palestinian B-NORP
gunmen O
have O
a O
responsibility O
to O
take O
greater O
precautions O

They O
have O
to O
realize O
that O
this O
is O
not O
a O
game O
going O
on O
there O
. O

It O
's O
a O
life O

death O
situation O
. O

Soldiers O
are O
basically O
thinking O
about O
their O

at O
that O

They O
do O

have O
time O

We O

it O

before O

got O

in O
San B-LOC

looking O

more O

in O
the O

That O

Numerous O

Right O

an O

police O
say O
that O
is O
where O
Scott B-PERSON

that O
he O
did O
go O
fishing O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
that O
Laci B-PERSON
Peterson I-PERSON
did O
disappear O
. O

Now O
, O
a O
source O
close O
to O
the O
investigation O
has O
told O
me O
that O
what O
they O
are O
really O
looking O
for O
are O
concrete O
anchors O
or O
weights O
which O
may O
have O
parts O
of O
Laci B-PERSON
Peterson I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
body O
or O

or O
something O
attached O
to O
it O

that O
they O
did O
discover O
a O
concrete O
weight O
in O
Scott B-PERSON
Peterson I-PERSON

If O
it O
matched O
, O
that O
would O
be O
something O
that O
could O
link O
Scott B-PERSON
Peterson I-PERSON
-- O
it O
would O
be O
like O
a O
smoking O
gun O
in O
this O

Inevitably O
they O
are O
looking O
for O
something O
linked O
to O
Laci B-PERSON

, O
whether O
-- O

That O
standing O

that O
Sammy B-PERSON

A O

official O
is O
scheduled O
to O
conduct O

in O
Chicago B-GPE

Those O
interviews O
could O
be O
a O
factor O
as O
the O

decides O
how O
Sammy B-PERSON

will O
be O
punished O
for O
using O
a O
cork O

The O

this B-TIME

, O
once O
again O
, O
Sammy B-PERSON
Sosa I-PERSON
will O
be O
in O
the O

he O
could O
find O
out O
as O
early O
as O
today B-DATE
what O
his O
punishment O
will O
be O
and O
how O
many O

he O

Last B-TIME
night I-TIME
when O
he O
went O
to O
play O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
, O
most O
of O
the O
fans O
on O
Wrigley B-FAC
Field I-FAC
gave O
him O
a O
standing O
ovation O
. O

In O
all O
fairness O
, O
not O
all O
of O
them O
totally O
believed O
Sammy B-PERSON
Sosa I-PERSON
but O
he O
's O
a O
hero O
here O
and O
they O
want O
to O
believe O
Sammy B-PERSON
Sosa I-PERSON
. O

He O
hit O
the O
ground O
ball O
on O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
inning O
, O
that O
scored O
a O
run O
, O
but O
the O
run O
was O
taken O
away O
. O

Sosa B-PERSON
was O
kicked O
out O
of O
the O
game O
after O
he O
was O
found O
out O
he O
had O
a O
cork O
during O
the O
bat O
. O

He O
meant O
not O
to O
use O
it O
during O
the O
game O
, O
but O
he O
did O
use O
it O
during O
the O
game O
. O

Major B-ORG
League I-ORG

took O
76 B-CARDINAL

x-rayed O
them O

Those O
x-rays O
were O
negative O
. O

That O
was O
conducted O
by O
a O
trained O
radiological O
technician O
. O

We O
believe O
the O
x-ray O
process O
was O
sufficient O
to O
determine O
the O
state O
of O
those O
bats O
and O
we O
're O
very O
confident O
that O
all O
of O
those O
bats O
were O
clean O
and O
had O
no O
foreign O
substances O
within O
them O

It O
was O
a O

We O
're O
all O

Nobody O

Reporter O

Last B-TIME
night I-TIME
with O
the O
bat O
, O
we O
assumed O
was O
not O
cork O
, O
Sammy B-PERSON
Sosa I-PERSON
struck O
out O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
three B-CARDINAL
times O
up O

He O
did O
hit O

the O
ninth B-ORDINAL

in O
a O
losing O
effort O
for O
the B-ORG
Chicago I-ORG

Back O
to O
you O

There O
's O
a O
concern O
with O
the O
huge O
series O
there O
this O
weekend O
with O
the O
Yankees B-ORG
coming O
to O
town O
that O
Sammy B-PERSON
would O
be O
suspended O

that O
. O

The O
Yankees B-ORG
vpts O
been O

since O
the O
1930s B-DATE
since O
they O
played O
the O
Cubs B-ORG
in O
the O
1930s B-DATE
. O

Sosa B-PERSON
could O
get O
a O
suspension O
, O
but O
he O
could O
appeal O
suspension O
. O

So O
if O
he O
wanted O
to O
play O
against O
the O
Yankees B-ORG
, O
he O
probably O
will O
be O
able O
to O
. O

all O

Reporter O

The O
revelations O
about O
Kennedy B-PERSON
's O
alleged O
affair O
with O
an O
intern O
make O
up O
just O
a O
couple O
lines O
in O
historian O
Robert B-PERSON
Dowd I-PERSON
's O
700 B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
plus I-CARDINAL
page O
biography O
. O

The O
information O
comes O
from O
a O
single O
source O
, O
an O
interview O
with O
a O
former O
Kennedy B-PERSON
staffer O
who O
says O
she O
does O
not O
remember O
the O
intern O
's O
last O
name O
. O

Although O
he O
finds O
the O
reports O
of O
Kennedy B-PERSON
's O
womanizing O
credible O
, O
he O
believes O
new O
information O
about O
Kennedy B-PERSON
's O
health O
problems O
is O
more O
significant O
. O

JFK B-PERSON
's O
public O
image O
was O
one O
of O
youthful O
vigor O
but O
in O
truth O
he O
battled O
serious O
medical O
problems O
his O
entire O
life O
. O

Twice O
before O
becoming O
President O
he O
was O
so O
sick O
, O
a O
priest O
was O
brought O
in O
to O
give O
him O
last O
rites O
. O

While O
researching O
his O
new O
book O
on O
JFK B-PERSON
, O
Dallic B-PERSON
uncovered O
previously O
sealed O
medical O
records O
that O
detailed O
the O
extent O
of O
his O
medical O
troubles O
and O
the O
lengths O
he O
went O
to O
conceal O
them O
from O
the O
public O
. O

There O
are O
many O
stories O
about O
politicians O
who O
used O
political O
influence O
to O
get O
out O
of O
military O
conflict O
, O
but O
Dallic B-PERSON
shows O
he O
used O
his O
family O
's O
influence O
to O
get O
into O
the O
Navy B-ORG
just O
as O
America B-GPE
was O
on O
the O
verge O
of O
World B-EVENT
War I-EVENT
II I-EVENT
. O

In O
1941 B-DATE
, O
he O
flunked O
two B-CARDINAL
military O
medical O
exams O
. O

His O
powerful O
father O
intervened O
, O
getting O
yet O
another O
exam O
. O

Reading O
the O
report O
of O
his O
exam O
, O
one O
would O
think O
he O
never O
had O
a O
serious O
physical O
problem O
in O
his O
life O
. O

It O
was O
a O
complete O
whitewash O
that O
would O
never O
have O
been O
possible O
without O
his O
father O
's O
help O
. O

Kennedy B-PERSON
entered O
the O
Navy B-ORG
earning O
hero O
status O
for O
saving O
his O
ship O
mates O
when O
his O
boat O
Pt O
was O
sunk O
by O
the O
Japanese B-NORP
. O

Dallek B-PERSON
says O
Kennedy B-PERSON
's O
brushes O
with O
death O
, O
combined O
with O
the O
deaths O
of O
his O
sister O
and O
brother O
, O
fueled O
the O
ambition O
that O
led O
him O
to O
become O
the O
youngest O
person O
elected O
President O
in O
American B-NORP
history O
. O

Kennedy B-PERSON
told O
a O

before O
he O
entered O

, O
you O

Five B-CARDINAL
motions O
are O
being O
heard O
today B-DATE
in O
the O
case O
of O
Lee B-PERSON
Boyd I-PERSON
Malvo I-PERSON
, O
the O
teenage O
sniper O
suspect O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
for O
a O
change O
of O
venue O
. O

Defense O
attorneys O
argue O
that O
there O
has O
been O
so O
much O
pretrial O
publicity O
, O
including O
an O
alleged O
confession O
from O
Malvo B-PERSON
, O
that O
this O
has O
tainted O
the O
jury O
pool O
. O

Their O
more O
intriguing O
argument O
is O
that O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
charges O
against O
Malvo B-PERSON
is O
under O
Virginia B-GPE
's O
anti-terrorism O
statute O
and O
they O
argue O
that O
every O
resident O
of O
Fairfax B-GPE
County I-GPE
is O
potentially O
a O
member O
of O
the O
victim O
's O
class O
. O
And O
therefore O
, O
disqualified O
from O
serving O
as O
a O
juror O
. O

The O
prosecutor O
will O
argue O
against O
this O
motion O
. O

He O
calls O
it O
factually O
proposterous O
. O

If O
history O
is O
any O
guide O
, O
this O
motion O
will O
have O
a O
tough O
time O
. O

No O
case O
has O
been O
moved O
out O
of O
Fairfax B-GPE
County I-GPE
since O
1974 B-DATE
. O

There O
also O
is O
a O
motion O
to O
dismiss O
this O
case O
. O

Defense O
attorneys O
argue O
that O
an O
individual O
can O
not O
be O
charged O
under O
federal O
law O
and O
then O
state O
law O
for O
the O
same O
act O
. O

Prosecutors O
again O
will O
argue O
against O
the O
motion O
. O

Three B-CARDINAL
other O
motions O
as O
well O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
of O
those O
for O
a O
handwriting O
expert O
, O
the O
other O
motions O
relate O
to O
getting O
background O
information O
relating O
to O
ballistics O
testing O

DNA O
testing O

about O
that O
in O
just O
a O

First B-ORDINAL

though O

what O
some O

Lawyers O

much O
time O
to O
go O
over O
the O
government O

evidence O
and O
prepare O
their O
case O
. O

Two B-CARDINAL
of O
the O

Samiel B-PERSON

This O
conflict O
over O
individual O

hardly O
new O
. O

President O
Lincoln B-PERSON
dealt O
with O
it O
during O
the B-EVENT
civil I-EVENT
war I-EVENT
, O
F.D.R. O
did O
in O
World B-EVENT
War I-EVENT
II I-EVENT
, O
and O
it O
is O
often O
true O
that O
decisions O
made O
in O
the O
heat O
of O
a O
moment O
, O
a O
war O
or O
after O
an O
attack O
look O
pretty O
good O
at O
the O

not O
so O
good O
as O

Whether O
that O
is O
true O
now O
, O
we O
can O
not O
say O

Others O
, O
however O
, O
have O
thoughts O
and O
Mr. O
Barr B-PERSON

among O
them O
, O
a O
Republican B-NORP
from O
the O
state O
of O
Georgia B-GPE

the O
result O

a O

Right O
now O
, O
cast O
our O
eyes O
to O
the B-LOC
Middle I-LOC

, O
getting O
word O
that O
a O
massive O
assembly O
of O
Shiite B-NORP
Muslims I-NORP
is O
now O
come O
together O
in O
Beirut B-GPE
, O
Lebanon B-GPE
. O

This O
is O
a O
rather O
remarkable O
arrangement O
because O
they O
are O
cheering O
there O
the O
arrival O
of O
Khatami B-PERSON
, O
the O
President O
of O
Iran B-GPE
. O

Now O
, O
he O
is O
making O
a O
trip O
and O
you O
see O
him O
there O
with O
his O
hands O
raised O
, O
there O
with O
the O
cloak O
on O
, O
shaking O
his O
fists O

hands O
clasped O
there O
, O
in O
a O
salute O
to O
the O
crowd O
. O

President O
Khatami B-PERSON
is O
in O
Beirut B-GPE
and O
what O
is O
observed O
here O
is O
very O
closely O
watched O
, O
what O
kind O
of O
words O
he O
'll O
utter O
when O
he O
speaks O
to O
this O
crowd O
. O

Iran B-GPE
now O
being O
pressured O
by O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
to O

Hezbollah B-ORG

an O
organization O
based O
in O
Lebanon B-GPE
that O
has O
been O
tied O
to O
terrorist O
activity O
and O
Peter B-PERSON
Bergen I-PERSON
mentioned O
Saudi B-NORP
Hezbollah B-ORG
an O
organization O
working O
in O
that O
country O
. O

The O
key O
is O
going O
to O
fwo O
see O
whether O
or O
not O
Khatami B-PERSON
actually O
does O
signal O
that O
he O
is O
going O
to O
be O
heeding O
the O
word O
of O
President O
Bush B-PERSON
and O
backing O
off O
in O
some O
way O
in O
supporting O
Hezbollah B-ORG
. O

That O
will O
be O
a O
very O
important O
development O
as O
we O
continue O

the O
Mideast B-LOC
peace O

report O

work O
, O
but O
instead O
, O
2,000 B-CARDINAL
showed O
up O
because O
they O
heard O
about O
it O
on O
the O
radio O
, O
so O
the O
whole O
college O
was O
swarmed O
with O
police O
officers O

this O
gentleman O
was O
kind O

the O
whole O
operation O

one O
man O
has O
his O

Was O
basically O
an O
angry O
officer O

We O
came O
across O
a O

there O
were O
about O
maybe O
five B-CARDINAL

six B-CARDINAL
Iraqi B-NORP
locals O
with O
AK O
machine O
guns O

checking O

Those O

the O

are O
taking O
pride O
in O
the O

We O
had O

rumors O

an O
underground O

and O

had O
it O
there O
was O
a O
bunch O
of O
Kuwaitis B-NORP
and O
one B-CARDINAL
American B-NORP
held O
in O
this O
underground O
prison O
that O
people O

so O
we O
went O

find O
a O

run O

Michael B-PERSON

no O

Sears B-PERSON
was O
serving O
a O
30 B-DATE

confessed O
1992 B-DATE
killing O

his O

but O
after O
a O

unlikely O
to O
commit O
such O

again O

the O

got O
him O

He O

nine I-DATE

Maryland B-GPE
is O
the O

unchecked O
judicial O
reconsideration O
, O
allowing O
judges O
to O
reduce O
prison O
terms O
at O
any O
time O

Those O
favoring O
the O
rule O
say O
it O
gives O
convicts O
incentive O
to O
behave O
in O
prison O

enables O
judges O
to O
release O
prisoners O
if O
new O

Last B-DATE

an O

A O

, O
and O
2001 O
, O
we O
passed O
what O
's O
called O
the O
No B-LAW
Child I-LAW
Left I-LAW
Behind I-LAW
legislation O
. O

I O
love O
that O
phrase O
, O
because O
it O
's O
a O
commitment O
of O
our O
nation O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
not O
only O
does O
every O
child O
excel O
, O
but O
no O
child O
gets O
left O
behind O
. O

Members O
of O
both O
parties O
, O
both O
Republicans B-NORP
and O
Democrats B-NORP
came O
together O
to O
pass O
this O
law O
. O

Inherent O
in O
the O
law O
is O
the O
vision O
of O
high O
standards O
, O
and O
money O
to O
meet O
the O
standards O
. O

An O
historic O
reforms O
. O

All O
of O
which O
put O
the O
education O
decisions O
of O
America B-GPE
in O
the O
hands O
of O
teachers O
and O
principals O
and O
local O
officials O
. O

But O
we O
also O
said O
that O
as O
we O
seek O
excellence O
for O
every O
child O
, O
we O
must O
design O
accountability O
systems O
at O
the O
state O
level O
to O
determine O
whether O
or O
not O
each O
child O
is O
learning O
. O

In O
order O
to O
make O
sure O
no O
child O
gets O
left O
behind O
, O
we O
must O
understand O
whether O
or O
not O
each O
child O
is O
learning O
to O
read O
and O
write O
and O
add O
and O
subtract O
. O

If O
there O
are O
, O
there O
will O
be O
plenty O
of O
praise O
. O

If O
not O
, O
we O
will O
work O
to O
design O

to O
make O
sure O
no O

left O

That O
's O
the O

Why O

I O

that O
quickly O
. O

I O

few I-TIME
hours I-TIME
after O
the B-ORG

. O

The O
reason O
you O

we O

the O

It O
was O
a O
horrific O
sight O
, O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
go O

obviously O
, O
we O
can O
only O
imagine O
how O
bad O
it O
might O
have O
been O
. O

It O
probably O
was O
, O
indeed O
, O
based O
on O
your O
eyewitness O
accounts O
. O

What O
happened O
? O

They O
were O
collecting O
evidence O
as O
you O
were O
there O
, O
the O
law O
enforcement O
authorities O
? O

They O
had O
been O
collecting O
their O
evidence O
and O
, O
of O
course O
, O
when O
I O
got O
there O
they O
showed O
me O
the O
location O
and O
, O
of O
course O
, O
then O

Martha B-PERSON

4,000 B-CARDINAL

of O

that O
netted O
her O
about B-MONEY
$ I-MONEY
225,000 I-MONEY

How O
does O
this O
compare O
with O
other O
corporate O
scandals O
? O

Enron B-ORG

cost O
thousands B-CARDINAL
of O

both O

The O

the O
only O
one O

WorldCom B-ORG
once O

Tyco B-ORG

At O

, O
Martha B-PERSON
Stewart I-PERSON
was O
worth O
in O
the O
neighborhood O

$ B-MONEY
1 I-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
, O
so O
you O
could O
make O
the O
argument O
she O
might O
have O
been O
guilty O
of O
stupidity O
. O

But O
the O
question O
Is O
she O
being O
unfairly O
singled O
out O
for O
prosecution O
? O

The O
e-mail O
address O
is O
am@cnn.com. O

I O
'm O

we O
will O
select O
some O
of O
the O
responses O

share O
them O
with O
you O
a O

What O
makes O
something O
worth O
a B-MONEY
billion I-MONEY

have O
to O
grab O
the O
phone O
after O
losing O
two B-CARDINAL
grand I-CARDINAL

a O

It O

Joining O

is O
Tom B-PERSON
Rinks I-PERSON
with O

John B-PERSON
Doza I-PERSON

Tom B-PERSON
, O
you O
've O
got O
to O
be O
happy O
with O
the O

I O
know O
they O
're O
going O
to O
appeal O
, O
but O
first B-ORDINAL
tell O
me O
how O
you O
came O
up O
with O
the O
Chihuahua O
character O
? O

Joe B-PERSON
and O
myself O
, O
he O
's O
the O
partner O
, O
we O
were O
looking O
to O
design O
some O
licenses O
to O
put O
on O
some O
t O
- O
shirts O
, O
and O
at O
the O
time O
big O
dogs O
were O
big O
, O
and O
all O
the O
mean O
dogs O
, O
and O
no O
fear O
was O
a O
big O
hit O
, O
and O
we O
thought O
it O
was O
time O
for O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
change O
for O
the O
18 B-CARDINAL
crowd O
. O

So O
we O
actually O
took O
the O
opposite O
of O
all O
that O
, O
and O
looked O
for O
the O
smallest O
, O
weakest O
, O
most O
timid O
animal O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
make O
him O
cool O
, O
tried O
to O
make O
him O
big O
, O
and O
we O
knew O
if O
he O
gave O
him O
some O
spunk O
, O
everybody O
would O
root O
for O
him O
. O

How O
did O
the O
Taco B-ORG
Bell I-ORG
folks O
run O
into O
you O
? O

They O
actually O
came O
to O
us O
at O
a O
licensing O
show O
. O

We O
had O
been O
licensing O
to O
a O
bunch O
of O
different O
manufacturers O
, O
and O
in O
1996 B-DATE
we O
were O
at O
a O
show O
in O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
City I-GPE
where O
Nick B-PERSON
Loada I-PERSON
and O
Universal B-ORG
Studios I-ORG
, O
and O
Taco B-ORG
Bell I-ORG
walked O
up O
to O
us O
and O
said O
they O
were O
looking O
for O
a O
masscot O
for O
their O
brand O
and O
this O
would O
be O
perfect O
. O

That O
started O
a O
year O
relationship O
we O
had O
with O
them O
. O

And O
it O
went O
on O
for O
a B-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
and O
you O
thought O
it O
did O
n't O
pan O
out O
and O
then O
you O
pick O
up O
a O
trade O
paper O
and O
read O
they O
're O
going O
ahead O
with O
it O
? O

After O
we O
'd O
finalized O
all O
the O
commercials O
, O
and O
actually O
done O
the O
campaign O
for O
them O
, O
they O
hired O
a O
new O
ad O
agency O
, O
and O
telephone O
calls O
just O
started O
staggering O
off O
. O

Then O
they O
stopped O
coming O
, O
and O
we O
heard O
about O
the O
ads O
, O
and O
they O
were O
exactly O
what O
we O
had O
presented O
for O
over B-DATE
a I-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

When O
you O
first B-ORDINAL
heard O
that O
, O
or O
read O
that O
, O
did O
you O
just O
go O
ballistic O
? O

I O
mean O
, O
no O
offense O
, O
but O
it O
was O
you O
and O
one O
other O
guy O
who O
created O
this O
thing O
. O

They O
're O
a O
huge O
, O
huge O

Yeah O
, O
it O
was O
devastating O
, O
to O

did O

The O

A O

they O

It O
looks O

the O

you O

a O

Bill B-PERSON

I O

I.K. B-PERSON
in O

a O

I O
can O
tell O
you O
without O
hesitation O
, O
a O
chicken O
can O
not O
be O
nursed O
. O

Only O
mammals O
that O
have O
distinct O

Chickens O
are O
also O
devoid O

much O
to O
the O

city O
people O
? O

No O
. O

Our O
viewers O
are O
nice O

not O
nasty O

Here O
is O
the O
explanation O

This O
is O
the O
real O
deal O

Any O
farm O
kid O
knows O
that O
certain O

can O
not O

The O

try O

nurse O
the O
chicken O
hen O

They O
do O
that O
by O
feel O
, O
not O
sight O
. O

A O
chicken O
hen O
is O
warm O

comfortable O

so O
they O
try O
their O
luck O

eventually O
feel O
their O
way O
back O

the O
mother O

where O
things O

better O

the O

Both O

Barak B-PERSON
told O

he O

the O

He O
said O
U.S. B-GPE

I O
believe O
that O
an O
end O
to O
violence O
could O
be O
accomplished O
, O
and O
in O
a O
way O
should O
be O
accomplished O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
the O
mechanism O
for O
making O
kind O
of O
tighter O
control O
, O
maybe O
American B-NORP
, O
Israeli B-NORP
, O
Palestinian B-NORP
mechanism O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
the O

Palestinian B-NORP
leaders O

A O
Palestinian B-ORG
Council I-ORG
member O
says O
anger O
is O
growing O

Even O
the O
language O
betrays O
a O
sort O
of O
racist O
mentality O
, O
where O
they O
view O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
people O
as O
either O
a O
regimented O
army O
or O
a O
herd O
of O
sheep O
to O
be O
given O
orders O
and O
to O
be O
led O
blindly O
. O

No O
, O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
people O
have O
a O
will O
of O
their O
own O
. O

They O
have O
been O
long O
victimized O
. O

They O
have O
suffered O
under O
the O
peace O
process O
and O
under O
the O
Israeli B-NORP
occupation O
, O
in O
a O
way O
which O
is O
most O
brutal O
and O
violent O
. O

The O
Israelis B-NORP
have O
been O
using O
the O
peace O
process O
as O
a O
cover O
to O
perpetuate O
the O
occupation O

and O
, O
therefore O
, O
the O
feelings O

justice O

a O

some O

mention O
it O

the O

something O

They O
can O
respond O

The O

but O
growth O
in O

was O
unchanged O

That O
as O
October B-DATE

far O
fewer O

than O
expected O
and O
September B-DATE

So O
far O
this O

the O

averaging O
182,000 B-CARDINAL

again O

the O

One B-CARDINAL

above O
market O
expectations O
. O

Average O
hourly O

now O
up O
3.8 B-PERCENT

Some O

note O
that O
's O
been O
the O
trend O
for O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
few I-DATE
years I-DATE
and O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
main O
reasons O
the O
Fed B-ORG
remains O
on O
inflation O
alert O
despite O
other O
signs O
the O
economy O
is O
cooling O
. O

I O
think O
this O
number O
will O
certainly O
continue O
to O
calm O
the O
fears O
of O
policymakers O
, O
but O
I O
think O
it O
will O
put O
off O
that O
belief O
that O
the O
Fed B-ORG
is O
going O
to O
lower O
interest O
rates O
anytime O
soon O
. O

Meantime O
, O
the O

could O
n't O
wait O
to O
put O
a O
positive O
spin O
on O
the O
nation O
's O
unemployment O
rate O
, O
which O
stayed O
at O
a O
30 B-DATE
- I-DATE
year I-DATE
low O
. O

We O
have O
an O
economy O
that O
's O
in O
balance O
. O

Obviously O
, O
we O
continue O
to O
see O
signs O
of O
moderation O
, O
but O
let O

remember O
this O
is O
still O
the O
longest O
and O
strongest O
boom O
in O
all O
of O
American B-NORP
history O

For O
now O
, O
most O

see O
a O
portrait O

Such O
a O
move O

is O
considered O
highly O
unusual O
unless O
the O
information O

the O

the O
greatest O

Two B-DATE

existence O

information O

just O
this O
Monday B-DATE

handed O
it O
over O

defense O

Teams O

now O
fanned O
out O
to O
conduct O
interviews O
related O
to O
this O
new O
information O
for O
the O
defense O
team O

That O
information O
could O
cause O
the O
trial O
to O
be O
delayed O
even O
further O
. O

The O
defense O
team O
has O
already O
told O

that O
more O

may O
be O
required O

react O

So O
far O
, O
the O
three B-CARDINAL

That O
may O
change O
next B-DATE

if O
and O
when O
another O
delay O

the O
trial O
is O
requested O
by O
the O
defense O
. O

Just O
how O
important O
is O
the O
new O
information O
? O

That O
is O
difficult O
to O
say O
, O
because O
so O
far O
, O
only O
investigators O
and O
lawyers O
for O
the O
defense O
and O
prosection O
know O
what O
it O
is O
. O

In O
court O
on O
Tuesday B-DATE
, O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
lawyers O
for O
the O

defended O
all O
the O
secrecy O
saying O
, O
`` O

At O
one O

reading O

a O

Yeah O

That O

one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O

that O
was O
most O

to O

was O
in O

I O
thought O
it O
was O
for O

Yeah O

I O
guess O
apparently O
not O
and O
a O
lot O
of O
the O

making O

from O

Are O
they O
reporting O
it O

I O
guess O
at B-CARDINAL

one I-CARDINAL

A O

In O

Anyone O
who O
knows O
me O
knows O
my O
obsession O
with O
tween O
stars O
. O

They O
're O
kids O
eight B-DATE
to O
14 B-DATE
, O
and O
for O
millions B-CARDINAL
, O
their O
heroes O
barely O
occupy O
puberty O
. O

The O
reason O
for O
my O
obsession O
is O
simple O
, O
deep O
seething O
jealousy O
. O

It O
is O
n't O
enough O
for O
these O
tween O
stars O
to O
be O
on O
the O
TV O
or O
movie O
. O

They O
want O
to O
own O
every O
form O
of O
media O
and O
want O
to O
own O
it O
now O
. O

Unlike O
the B-PERSON
Corey I-PERSON
Feldman I-PERSON
of O
the O
' O
80s B-DATE
, O
today O
's O
tweens O
are O
n't O

with O
succeeding O

just O
one B-CARDINAL
of O

. O

Mary B-PERSON
Kate I-PERSON
and O
Ashley B-PERSON
Olsen I-PERSON
started O
it O
all O
. O

Now O
they O
have O
a O
billion B-MONEY

empire O
built O
on O

, O
clothing O
perfume O
and O
more O
. O

And O
then O
there O

the O

Hilary B-PERSON
Duff I-PERSON

off O
. O

Then O
when O
they O
're O
ready O
to O
breed O
they O
go O
to O
the O
WB B-ORG
. O

Why O
such O
a O
focus O
on O
these O
tween O
stars O
? O

It O
has O
little O
to O
do O
with O
their O
artistic O
vision O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
star O
told O
Vanity B-ORG
Fair I-ORG
their O
favorite O
author O
is O
whoever O
wrote O
the O
Bible B-WORK_OF_ART
. O

These O
kids O
are O
at O
that O
magical O
age O
when O
new O
multibillion B-CARDINAL
declare O
spending O
power O
is O
put O
in O
service O
of O
intense O
peer O

leading O

that O
can O
last O
a O

. O

The O
flip O
side O
between O
stars O
, O
though O
, O
is O
once O
the O
fans O
grow O
up O
their O
star O
power O
may O
dim O
. O

Do O
n't O
believe O
it O
just O
ask O
one O
of O
the O
Coreys B-PERSON
. O

These O
tweens O
are O
everywhere O
. O

They O
're O
right O
on O
the O
cover O
of O
Vanity B-ORG
Fair I-ORG
. O

Tweens O
are O
all O
over O
it O
. O

That O
's O
the O
issue O
right O
there O
. O

So O
we O
have O
with O
us O
Vanity B-ORG
Fair I-ORG
Fashion O
Director O
Elizabeth B-PERSON
Olsen I-PERSON
. O

I O
was O
shocked O
when O
I O
saw O
them O
cover O
the O
tweens O
. O

Why O
are O
they O
so O
important O
? O

They O
're O
important O
because O
we O
report O
on O
what O
's O
happening O
. O

We O
report O
on O
the O
culture O
of O
what O

now O
, O
what O

, O
what O
the O

is O
, O
what O
's O
next O
. O

And O
they O
're O
making O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
. O

A O
much O
more O
than O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
. O

Unlike O
stars O
of O
the O
past O
, O
they O
really O
are O
not O
content O
to O
be O
singers O
or O
dancers O
, O
they O
are O
like O
Omnimedia B-ORG
, O
mini O
Martha B-PERSON
Stewart I-PERSON
. O

They O
're O
more O
than O
that O
, O
actually O
, O
because O
they O
have O
a O
television O
show O
to O
back O
themselves O
up O
, O
then O
the O
movie O
, O
then O
the O
clothing O

. O

They O
have O
much O
more O
and O
reach O
a O
much O
broader O
audience O
as O
well O
. O

I O
saw O
one O
interviewed O
, O
and O
they O
said O
, O

, O
when O
I O

What O
happened O
to O
being O
kids O
? O

That O
was O
the O
great O
thing O
about O
the O
photo O

. O

They O
're O
still O
young O
, O
ambitious O
, O
excited O
, O
they O
play O
dressup O
and O
have O
pillow O

. O

Who O
's O
the O
ultimate O
tween O
? O

you O
have O
to O
talk O
about O
Hilary B-PERSON
Duff I-PERSON
, O
and O
you O
have O
to O
talk O
about O
the O
Olsen B-PERSON
twins O
. O

Because O
the O
Olsen B-PERSON
twins O
started O
it O
all O
. O

They O
created O
it O
, O
maybe O
. O

They O
more O
than O
started O
it O
. O

And O
they O
started O
prenatal O
. O

But O
they O
turned O
it O
into O
an O
empire O
, O
what O
Shirley B-PERSON
Temple I-PERSON
could O
have O
done O
. O

Had O
she O
only O
known O
. O

I O
think O
their O

Dual B-ORG

. O

Like O
a O
gross O
of O
a B-MONEY
billion I-MONEY

last B-DATE

. O

They O
work O
hard O
. O

They O
're O
not O
just O
sitting O
there O
hiring O
people O
to O
do O
their O
business O
. O

They O
do O
their O
own O
business O
, O
and O
they O
're O
well O
- O
rounded O
and O
polite O
people O
. O

Are O
they O
nice O
? O

They O
're O
so O
nice O
and O
cool O
. O

How O
about O
that O
? O

They O
're O
actually O
very O
, O
very O
cool O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
sure O
of O
that O
. O

And O
Hilary B-PERSON
Duff I-PERSON
is O
a O
star O
, O
and O
I O
guarantee O
you O
, O
they O
will O
grace O
their O
own O
cover O
. O

Do O
they O
all O
have O
staying O
power O
? O

One O
ca O
n't O
predict O
that O
all O
have O
it O
, O
but O
some O
have O
it O
. O

It O
depends O
on O
who O
's O
managing O
it O
, O
what O
career O
choices O
they O
make O
, O
what O
their O
parents O
help O
them O
to O

It O
would O
be O
interesting O
to O
see O
the O
audience O
that O
sort O
of O
adores O
them O
now O
, O
whether O

The O

It O

come O

it O

I O
think O
these O
are O
profitable O
childrens O
' O
book O

so O
very O
popular O

I O
think O
that O
people O
think O
they O
probably O
are O

for O
them O

As O
you O
mentioned O
, O
if O
anyone O
is O

to O
be O
selling O
these O
on O
the O

They O
will O
be O

Is O
that O
why O
you O
think O
they O
were O
stolen O
, O
sale O
before O
the O
deadline O
or O
after O
? O

I O
think O
probably O
they O
know O
they O
can O
make O
more O
money O
before O
the O
deadline O
on O
these O
books O
, O
but O
I O
know O
no O
reputable O
book O
shop O
will O
take O
these O
stolen O
goods O
and O
sell O
them O
. O

I O
think O
we O
are O
looking O
at O
in O

sales O
over O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
coming I-DATE
days I-DATE

We O
have O

will O

buying O
them O

For O
example O
, O
what O
will O
happen O
to O
the O
baby O
, O
and O
what O
will O
happen O
to O
JDS B-PERSON
? O

Of O
course O
, O
according O
to O
the O
guardian O
, O
she O
's O
very O
worried O
about O
that O
, O
too O
, O
and O
she O
has O
warned O
the O
court O
that O
she O
hopes O
the O
mother O
will O
be O
placed O
in O
a O
better O
home O
when O
all O
of O
this O
is O
over O
, O
one O
where O
she O
is O
far O
better O
protected O
than O
she O
was O
by O
the O
state O
in O
a O
home O
where O
police O
say O
she O
was O
raped O
. O

Aaron B-PERSON
? O

Well O
, O
two B-CARDINAL
questions O
. O

Do O
they O
know O
who O
the O
rapist O
is O
? O

That O
's O
sort O
a O
yes O
or O
no O
, O
I O
suppose O
. O

And O
the O
other O
is O
, O
Has O
the O
state O
done O
anything O
? O

Is O
it O
doing O
anything O
to O
tighten O
up O
security O
in O
these O
places O
with O
respect O
defenseless O
people O
are O
being O
attacked O
? O

Reporter O
: O

Well O
, O
first B-ORDINAL
of O
all O
, O
regarding O
the O
rape O
, O
they O
hope O
to O
find O
out O
who O
the O
father O
is O
once O
she O
gives O
birth O
because O
they O
will O
analyze O
DNA O
from O
the O
baby O
in O
order O
to O
try O
to O
determine O
paternity O
in O
this O
case O
, O
and O
the O
governor O
has O
ordered O
a O
panel O
of O
experts O
now O
to O
study O
this O
issue O
of O
security O
. O

Far O
better O
security O
than O
is O
clearly O
needed O
for O
people O
such O
as O
this O
woman O
, O
JDS B-PERSON
, O
living O
in O
group O

. O

Well O

One O
of O
the O

questions O
about O

is O
when O
or O
whether O
humans O
will O
ever O
be O
able O

It O

an O
idea O

the O
contributing O
editor O
. O

Good O
to O
see O
you O
, O
Jeff B-PERSON
. O

Thank O
you O
. O

It O
was O
only O
about B-DATE
30 I-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
when O
we O
went O
to O
the O
moon O
. O

So O
what O
's O
the O
difficulty O
in O
being O
able O
to O
go O
to O
Mars B-LOC
? O

It O
's O
unimaginably O
difficult O
and O
different O
. O

Mars B-LOC
is O
at O
most O
times O
100 B-QUANTITY
million I-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
away O
from O
us O
. O

It O
's O
a O
nine B-DATE
- I-DATE
month I-DATE
trip O
. O

Then O
if O
we O
stay O
there O
for O
about O
a O
year B-DATE
or I-DATE
two I-DATE
, O
the O
whole O
trip O
could O
last O
about B-DATE
three I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

We O
're O
talking O
about O
conditions O
where O
there O
's O
radiation O
in O
space O
cosmic O
radiation O
that O
could O
cause O
cancer O
. O

The O
communications O
conditions O
once O
you O
're O
on O
Mars B-LOC
, O
just O
to O
talk O
to O
people O
on O
earth O
, O
there O
's O
a O
20 B-TIME
minute I-TIME
delay O
in O
the O
conversation O
. O

So O
you O
know O
, O
the O
issues O
are O
so O
much O
larger O
than O
going O
to O
the O
moon O
. O

And O
for O
now O
, O
it O
's O
250 B-DATE
days I-DATE
, O
which O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
maximum O
for O
astronauts O
in O
space O
anyway O
, O
but O
as O
you O
say O
, O
it O
's O
a O
much O
further O
travel O
. O

But O
let O
's O
talk O
about O
some O
of O
the O
hurdles O
that O
hamper O
humans O
to O
be O
able O
to O
survive O
there O
. O

The O
dust O
, O
for O
one O
thing O
. O

Cataracts O
another O
. O

Let O
's O
talk O
about O
the O
right O
kind O
of O
spacecraft O
that O
would O
be O
able O
to O
allow O
humans O
to O
actually O
get O
that O
far O
and O
to O
survive O
. O

Right O
. O

Well O
, O
first O
of O
all O
, O
the O
spacecraft O
would O
not O
be O
launched O
from O
Earth B-LOC
. O

You O
'd O
have O
to O
launch O
it O
from O
in O
space O
already O
, O
which O
means O
we O
would O
have O
to O
build O
it O
in O
space O
. O

So O
that O
means O
we O
need O
a O
good O
shuttle O
that O
's O
going O
to O
take O
us O
back O
and O
forth O
to O
build O
the O
spacecraft O
. O

Then O
we O
have O
to O
come O
up O
with O
the O
fuel O
that O
will O
take O
it O
out O
of O
the O
Earth B-LOC
's O
orbit O
all O
the O
way O
to O
Mars B-LOC
. O

That O
's O
probably O
going O
to O
be O
nuclear O
propulsion O
at O
this O
point O
again O
something O
we O
have O
n't O
really O
developed O
yet O
, O
because O
we O
could O
n't O
carry O
that O
much O
fuel O
, O
obviously O
. O

Liquid O
oxygen O
would O
be O
way O
too O
heavy O
to O
carry O
all O
the O
way O
to O
Mars B-LOC
. O

The O
bigger O
issue O
is O
once O
we O
get O
there O
, O
we O
ca O
n't O
carry O
oxygen O
or O
water O
or O
food O
to O
stay O
there O
three B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
so O
we O
're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
do O
all O
of O
that O
on O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
planet O
. O

And O
think O
of O
it O
. O

Mars B-LOC
is O
carbon O
dioxide O
, O
so O
we O
ca O
n't O
breathe O
there O
. O

So O
we O
're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
come O
up O
with O
some O
conversion O
technique O
to O
create O
water O
, O
to O
create O
oxygen O
and O
then O
some O
way O
of O
growing O
food O
on O
the O
planet O
itself O
. O

All O
of O
this O
is O
in O
the O
works O
now O
, O
but O
I O
think O
it O
's O
going O
to O
take O
quite B-DATE
a I-DATE
few I-DATE
years I-DATE
to O
develop O
it O
. O

You O
talk O
about O
the O
cosmic O
radiation O
. O

Then O
of O
course O
there O
is O
the O
zero B-CARDINAL
G O
bone O
loss O
, O
almost O
like O
the O
eroding O
of O
bone O
to O
humans O
that O
would O
be O
at O
risk O
as O
well O
. O

Absolutely O
. O

There O
could O
be O
as B-PERCENT
much I-PERCENT
as I-PERCENT
50 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
bone O
loss O
in O
astronauts O
in O
Mars B-LOC
. O

Why O
? O

During O
the O
time O
in O
Mars B-LOC
. O

Because O
when O
there O
is O
no O
gravity O
as O
there O
is O
on O
Mars B-LOC
, O
the O
body O
does O
n't O
pick O
up O
the O
calcium O
in O
the O
bones O
, O
so O
it O
does O
n't O
keep O
getting O
the O
bones O
stronger O
and O
stronger O
, O
so O
they O
will O
just O
lose O
it O
. O

They O
will O
be O
almost O
like O
old O
people O
even O
at O
the B-DATE
age I-DATE
of I-DATE
40 I-DATE
. O

Jeff O

it O
will O

That O

before O

Thanks O

Tell O

a O
little O
about O
this O
journey O
, O
that O
moment O
when O
you O
first O
saw O
her O
. O

You O
traveled O
. O

This O
is O
going O
on O
two B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

You O
battled O
bureaucracy O
, O
traveling O
thousands B-QUANTITY
of I-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
, O
facing O
disease O
. O

What O
was O
that O
like O
? O

Incredible O
, O
you O
know O
, O
just O
to O
hold O
her O
in O
our O
arms O
, O
have O
her O
with O
us O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
you O
count O
the O
moments O
, O
and O
it O
was O
just O
anticipation O
all O
the O
way O
there O
. O

So O
it O
was O
relief O
. O

It O
was O
, O
you O
know O
, O
a O
dream O
come O
true O
. O

she O
's O
really O
a O
delight O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
though O
it O
was O
a O
little O
pandemonium O
at O
the O
moment O
, O
she O
's O
wonderful O
. O

We O
love O
her O
. O

And O
, O
Mark B-PERSON
, O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
you O
were O
holding O
her O
, O
it O
looked O
like O
she O
was O
crying O
a O
lot O
. O

She O
seemed O
startled O
to O
see O
someone O
that O
looked O
so O
different O
. O

Yes O
, O
this O
was O
probably O
her O
first B-ORDINAL
experience O
ever O
seeing O
a O
fair O
- O
skinned O
, O
bearded O
goatee O
, O
monster O
- O
looking O
guy O
and O
she O
just O
freaked O
out O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
she O
saw O
me O
. O

It O
took O
about B-DATE
a I-DATE
day I-DATE
and I-DATE
a I-DATE
half I-DATE
for O
her O
to O
warm O
up O
. O

I O
had O
to O
hide O
in O
the O
hotel O
room O
. O

She O
would O
find O
me O
in O
the O
room O
and O
start O
crying O
every O
time O
she O
saw O
me O
. O

You O
had O
to O
hide O
in O
the O
hotel O
room O
? O

Yeah O
, O
she O
'd O
find O
me O
across O
the O
room O
and O
break O
into O
tears O
. O

It O
was O
kind O
of O
that O
way O
with O
anyone O
that O
was O
blond O
, O
that O
was O
fair O
- O
skinned O
. O

Yeah O
. O

When O
you O
first B-ORDINAL
heard O
about O
Sars O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
did O
you O
suddenly O
think O
, O
this O
may O
not O
happen O
? O
this O
could O
stop O
the O
whole O
thing O
. O

Sure O
. O

We O
got O
calls O
that B-TIME
morning I-TIME
saying O
`` O
Did O
you O
hear O
that O
they O
're O
halting O
all O
travel O
? O
'' O
and O
we O
put O
in O
a O
call O
to O
the O
agency O
, O
we O
were O
going O
, O
and O
we O
put O
a O
lot O
of O
trust O
in O
our O
agency O
, O
and O
they O
were O
great O
. O

You O
know O
, O
unless O
we O
were O
absolutely O
stopped O
, O
we O
were O
going O
. O

Right O
. O

After O
two B-DATE
years I-DATE
of O
working O
towards O
it O
, O
we O
were O
almost O
more O
afraid O
not O
to O
go O
than O
to O
go O
at O
the O
very O
end O
. O

You O
know O
, O
Mark B-PERSON
, O
I O
hope O
this O
is O
n't O
too O
personal O
a O
question O
. O

If O
it O
is O
, O
just O
simply O
tell O
me O
to O
shut O
up O
. O

But O
in O
the O
story O
I O
saw O
Abby B-PERSON
was O
abandoned O
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
road O
, O
which O
it O
's O
unthinkable O
. O

You O
ca O
n't O
even O
imagine O
a O
parent O
doing O
that O
. O

What O
do O
you O
think O
you O
're O
going O
to O
tell O
her O
when O
she O
grows O
up O
about O
how O
she O
came O
to O
live O
with O
you O
? O

Well O
, O
I O
get O
emotional O
every O
time O
someone O
asks O
that O
, O
but O
we O
're O
going O
to O
give O
her O
the O
best O
love O
and O
affection O
we O
can O
and O
give O
her O
a O
strong O
self O
esteem O

we O

going O

teach O
her O

we O
were O
100 B-PERCENT

sure O
we O

absolutely O

because O
we O
came O
very O
close O

our O

out O

So O
I O

I O
saw O
the O

that O

an O

At O
the O
very O

it O

out O

The O
Prime O

now O
contend O
with O
the O
rejection O

side O
Palestinian B-NORP
and O
Israeli B-NORP
states O
, O
a O
cornerstone O
of O
the O

He O

trying O
to O
get O
Hamas B-ORG
to O
co-exist O
with O
Israel B-GPE

Conservative O
Israelis B-NORP

skeptical O

He O
is O
not O

Hamas B-ORG

he O
is O
working O

He O
is O
negotiating O
with O
them O

He O
is O
not O
telling O
them O
to O
disband O

regulate O
their O
weapons O
, O
so O
I O
have O
no O
faith O
in O
the O
ability O
of O
Abu B-PERSON
Mazen I-PERSON
to O
put O
terror O
aside O
. O

I O
think O

if O
the O
only O

you O

fight O

if O
that O
's O
what O
they O
are O
requiring O
Abu B-PERSON
Mazen I-PERSON

do O
, O
they O
are O
almost O
mandating O
that O
he O

The O
main O
test O
of O
