The O

over O

face O
trial O
for O

but O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
, O
which O
has O
spent O
enormous O
amounts O
of O
time O
and O
energy O
fighting O
Milosevic B-PERSON
, O
seems O
more O
willing O
to O
wait O
tonight B-TIME

Tonight B-TIME
the O
U.S. B-GPE
is O
still O
offering O
to O
pay O
$ B-MONEY
5 I-MONEY
million I-MONEY
for O
information O
leading O
to O
the O
arrest O
and O
conviction O
of O
Slobodan B-PERSON
Milosevic I-PERSON
for O
war O
crimes O
. O

I O
believe O
we O
can O
not O
ignore O
the O
actions O
of O
the O
war O
crimes O
tribunal O
. O

I O
think O
we O
have O
to O
continue O
to O
support O
it O
, O
but O
there O
no O
longer O
seems O
to O
be O
any O
urgency O
about O
grabbing O
Milosevic B-PERSON
. O

The O
important O
thing O
first O
is O
to O
get O
him O
out O
of O
any O
position O
of O
any O
kind O
of O
power O
. O

Senior O
administration O
officials O
are O
now O
saying O
privately O
that O
if O
Milosevic B-PERSON
never O
comes O
to O
trial O
, O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
might O
not O
like O
it O
, O
but O
could O
live O
with O
it O
, O
as O
long O
as O
the O
man O
is O
gone O
. O

The O
new O
President O
of O
Yugoslavia B-GPE
, O
Vojislav B-PERSON
Kostunica I-PERSON
, O
has O
made O
it O
clear O
he O
would O
not O
be O
likely O
to O
turn O
over O
Milosevic B-PERSON
or O
anyone O
else O
to O
the O
war O
crimes O
tribunal O
. O

He O
says O
the O
tribunal O
is O
not O
fair O
and O
is O
manipulated O
by O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
-- O
the O
same O
criticism O
Milosevic B-PERSON
had O
, O
but O
in O
most O
ways O
, O
Milosevic B-PERSON
and O
Vojislav B-PERSON
Kostunica I-PERSON
have O
starkly O
different O
views O
. O

On O
freedom O
of O
the O
press O
, O
rule O
of O
law O
and O
a O
free O
market O
economy O
, O
Milosevic B-PERSON
opposed O
them O
all O
. O

Kostunica B-PERSON
supports O
them O
. O

His O
great O
advantage O
above O
all O
else O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
is O
not O
corrupt O
. O

He O
's O
clean O
. O

He O
seems O
as O
the O
most O
honorable O
man O
in O
Serbian B-NORP
politics O
. O

Like O
most O
Serbs B-NORP
, O
Kostunica B-PERSON
is O
bitterly O
critical O
of O
Nato B-ORG
's O
bombing O
campaign O
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

He O
also O
thinks O
the O
Clinton B-PERSON
administration O
and O
especially O
Madeleine B-PERSON
Albright I-PERSON
pursued O
anti-Serbian B-NORP
policies O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
in O
many O
respects O
, O
he O
is O
very O
pro-American B-NORP
. O

To O
help O
him O
, O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
is O
moving O
quickly O
to O
lift O
economic O
sanctions O
and O
is O
exploring O
ways O
to O
send O
aid O
. O

The O
U.S. B-GPE
now O
has O
10,000 B-CARDINAL
troops O
in O
the O
Balkans B-LOC
, O
at O
a O
cost O
of O
$ B-MONEY
4 I-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
a O
year O
. O

The O
next O
step O
will O
be O
to O
look O
for O
ways O
to O
cut O
those O
numbers O

no O

about O
it O

it O
is O
also O

Mexicans B-NORP

voting O

a O
man O
who O
has O
charmed O

Fox B-PERSON

from O

His O
grandfather O
was O
an O
Irishman B-NORP

but O
as O
a O

Fox B-PERSON
left O
the O

Working O

working O
hard O
, O
man O

But O
it O
will O
clearly O
take O
much O
more O
than O

work O
to O
make O
changes O
that O
will O
affect O
not O
only O
Mexico B-GPE

the B-GPE
United I-GPE

. O

He O
says O
he O
will O
drive O
out O
the O
drug O

He O
promised O
to O
reduce O
poverty O
, O
which O
could O
mean O
an O
open O
border O
with O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE

since O
fewer O
Mexicans B-NORP
would O
want O
to O
cross O
over O
for O
jobs O
. O

He O
's O
even O
promised O
to O
stamp O
out O
corruption O
. O

Corruption O
is O
the O
evil O
of O
all O
evils O
. O

When O
you O
were O
campaigning O
, O
you O
called O

`` O

Do O
you O

I O
am O
inviting O

But O
why O
should O
they O
help O
you O

You O
beat O

You O
destroyed O

Well O

I O
'm O
sure O
in O
their O
heart O
they O
still O
love O
Mexico B-GPE

Many O
people O
here O
believe O
Fox B-PERSON
is O
naive O

The O
danger O
is O
probably O
he O
can O
not O
deliver O
the O

that O
he O
made O
during O

If O

The O
investigation O

the O

crippled O

a O
positive O
turn O
when O
Yemeni B-NORP

it O

, O
to O

one O

lesson O

On O

night I-TIME
Postville B-GPE
feels O
like O
Hometown B-GPE
, I-GPE
USA I-GPE
, O
but O
a O
look O
around O
this O
town O
of O
2,000 B-CARDINAL
shows O
it O
's O
become O
a O
miniature O
Ellis B-LOC
Island I-LOC

This O
was O
an O
all O

white O

all O

christian B-NORP
community O
that O
all O
the O
sudden O
was O
taken O
over O

not O
taken O
over O
, O
that O
's O
a O
very O
bad O
choice O
of O
words O
, O
but O
invaded O
by O
, O
perhaps O
different O
groups O
. O

It O
began O
when O
a O
Hasidic B-NORP
Jewish I-NORP
family O
bought O
one O
of O
the O

Ukrainians B-NORP
. O

The O
plant O
and O
another O
next O
door O
changed O
the O
face O
of O
Postville B-GPE
. O

I O
think O
Postville B-GPE
might O
be O
catching O
up O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
America B-GPE
. O

If O
you O
look O
all O
over O
America B-GPE
, O
if O
you O
did O
a O
study O
of O
any O
great O
city O
, O
you O
would O
see O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

The O
plants O
helped O
spur O
economic O
development O
in O
a O
town O
that O
had O
long O
been O
stagnant O
. O

Stores O

there O
are O
hundreds B-CARDINAL

making O

almost O
nonexistent O

What O
else O
would O
you O
like O
? O

Postville B-GPE
now O
has O
22 B-CARDINAL
different O
nationalities O
, O
but O
some O
residents O
have O
n't O
welcomed O
the O

They O
have O
no O

They O

It O

a O

that O
it O

Mr. O

this O
the O
way O
he O
did O
in O
the B-ORG

Yes O
, O
it O
took O
a O
while O
last B-TIME

to O
sort O
out O
precisely O
what O
the O

had O
decided O
by O
such O
a O
narrow O
margin O
. O

It O
is O
case O

it O

Here O
's O
ABC B-ORG

Jackie B-PERSON
Judd I-PERSON
. O

The B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
cleared O
the O
way O
for O
George B-PERSON
W. I-PERSON
Bush I-PERSON
to O
become O
President O
by O
interpreting O
the O
principle O
of O
`` O
equal O
protection O
under O
the O
law O
'' O
in O
a O
way O
it O
had O
never O
done O
before O
. O

Equal O
protection O
cases O
often O
deal O
with O
discrimination O
based O
on O
race O
. O

Here O
, O
the O
court O
applied O
it O
to O
counting O
voters O
' O
ballots O
. O

It O
's O
now O
become O
clear O
, O
that O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
federal O
law O
, O
there O
have O
to O
be O
reasonably O
uniform O
standards O
for O
collecting O
people O
's O
votes O
and O
for O
interpreting O
those O
votes O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
equal O
protection O
became O
the O
single B-CARDINAL
issue O
this O
divided O
court O
could O
find O
a O
majority O
to O
support O
. O

This O
was O
a O
stabilizing O
decision O
that O
restored O
order O
to O
a O
very O
chaotic O
situation O
. O

And O
with O
that O
in O
mind O
, O
the O
justices O
-- O
in O
a O
highly O
unusual O
move O
-- O
said O
their O
ruling O
`` O
is O
limited O
to O
the O
present O
circumstances O
'' O
only O
, O
meaning O
it O
applies O
just O
to O
Bush B-PERSON
v. O
Gore B-PERSON
. O

Not O
likely O
, O
say O
many O
legal O
experts O
. O

What O
they O
've O
done O
now O
amounts O
to O
, O
what O
could O
be O
a O
very O
important O
general O
principle O
, O
and O
take O
it O
right O
back O
again O
immediately O
by O
saying O
, O
`` O
well O
, O
we O
do O
n't O
intend O
to O
enforce O
this O
in O
any O
other O
case O
. O
'' O

Even O
those O
who O
support O
aspects O
of O
the O
ruling O
still O
expect O
it O
to O
affect O
many O
states O
with O
election O
laws O
similar O
to O
Florida B-GPE
. O

That O
raises O
a O
host O
of O
new O
questions O
, O
not O
just O
about O
recounts O
, O
but O
about O
different O
voting O
machines O
and O
differences O
between O
one B-CARDINAL
city O
and O
another O
city O
within O
the O
same O
state O
. O

Even O
it O
raises O
questions O
about O
differences O
between O
citizens O
of O
different O
states O
. O

This O
historic O
decision O
will O
certainly O
be O
remembered O
as O
the O
one O
that O
put O
a O
President O
in O
the B-FAC
White I-FAC

but O
it O
may O
also O

even O

It O
's O
just O
that O
Tennessee B-GPE
is O
a O
genuine O
two B-CARDINAL
- O
party O
state O
and O
has O
been O
for O
a O
long O

although O

never O

`` O
we O

'' O

You O
've O
got O
a O
Republican B-NORP

, O
two B-CARDINAL
Republican B-NORP
senators O
, O
the O
majority O

They O
'd O

nothing O
better O
than O
for O
them O
to O
embarrass O
him O
in O
his O

state O
. O

So O
, O
Tennessee B-GPE
's O
most O
illustrious O
modern O

is O
having O
to O
work O
mighty O
hard O
at O

1 I-MONEY

something O
they O
did O

on O
. O

Can O
you O
come O
out O
and O
work O
hard O
for O
him O
one B-CARDINAL
more O
time O
? O

The O
importance O
of O
Tennessee B-GPE
to O
my O
family O
goes O
way O
beyond O
its O
11 B-CARDINAL

Sure O
, O
it O
's O
a O
matter O

Those O

there O
had O

in O

If O
we O
use O
25 B-CARDINAL

then O
that O
roughly O
adds O
up O

little O
less O
than O
500 B-CARDINAL

within O

tonight B-TIME
he O
went O

-- O
something O
Milosevic B-PERSON
never O

Disdain O

Yesterday B-DATE

targeted O
mostly O
at O
him O

The O

focused O
much O

anything O
associated O
with O
Milosevic B-PERSON

This O
is O
the O
local O
party O

As O
you O
can O
see O
, O
every O
window O
is O
broken O

the O

is O
trashed O

The O
mob O
also O
singled O
out O
and O
destroyed O
the O
store O
owned O
by O
Milosevic B-PERSON

They O
burned O
the O
TV O

that O
carried O

beat O
the O

tonight B-TIME
, O
the O
people O
seem O
to O
be O
turning O
away O

praying O
instead O
for O
a O

a O
Canadian B-NORP
province O

For O
as O
long O
as O
they O

fishermen O
on O

not O
too O

another O

salmon O

Oh O
, O
yeah O
, O
we O
used O
to O
get O
salmon O
in O
the O
spring B-DATE
, O
but O
we O
do O
n't O
see O
it O
anymore O
. O

I O
think O
they O
are O
pretty O
well O
wiped O
out O

But O
only O
two B-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
away O
, O
Atlantic B-LOC
salmon O
are O
thriving O
, O
and O
that O
's O
an O
understatement O

These O
experimental O
salmon O
are O
on O
the O
cutting O
edge O
of O
the O
debate O
over O
genetically O
engineered O

because O
a O

found O
a O
way O

How O

this O

Same O

It O
is O
up O
to O
the B-ORG
Food I-ORG

Administration I-ORG
to O
decide O
if O
these O
will O
be O
the O

genetically O

But O
is O
that O

capable O

judging O
what O

it O

Senior O
government O
wildlife O

their O
doubts O

I O
think O
it O

asking O
more O
of O
the O
FDA B-ORG
than O
it O
should O
be O
asked O
to O
turn O
it O
into O
a O
wildlife O
agency O

The O
FDA B-ORG
says O
it O
has O
hired O
experts O
in O
the O
field O
, O
but O
unlike O
wildlife O
agencies O
, O
the O
FDA B-ORG
keeps O
its O
research O
and O
evaluations O
secret O
from O
the O
public O
. O

Laws O
do O
stipulate O
that O
there O
are O
certain O
types O
of O
material O
that O
we O
need O
to O
hold O
in O
confidence O
. O

Which O
worries O
some O
who O
think O
it O
's O
important O
people O
know O
if O
creating O
supersalmon O
to O
feed O
human O
appetites O
could O
threaten O
normal O
salmon O
. O

We O
have O
shown O
they O
have O
a O
tremendous O
potential O
to O
upset O
the O
balance O
of O
nature O

The O
company O
producing O
the O
supersalmon O
says O
it O
can O
solve O
that O
problem O
by O
engineering O
fish O
that O
never O
mate O
, O
but O
the O
balance O
of O
nature O
grows O
more O
complicated O

controversial O

American B-NORP

'' O

Early O
on O
investigators O
theorized O
it O
was O
an O
inside O
job O

much O
of O
the O
focus O
was O
on O

the O

had O

arrival O

Now O
the O
FBI B-ORG
believes O
all O
the O

needed O
to O
do O
was O
look O
out O

to O
go O

before O

Learning O
the O
