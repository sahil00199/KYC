of O

appear O

more O
receptive O
to O
criticism O
of O
the O

skeptical O

/. O

We O

we O
need O
to O

One B-CARDINAL
analyst O
says O
that O
if O

fourteen B-CARDINAL
marines O

today B-DATE
had O
been O
ambushed O
last B-DATE

the O
election O
results O
might O
have O
been O

Secondly B-ORDINAL
Schmidt B-PERSON

close O
call O
may O
suggest O
that O
aligning O
with O
the O
administration O
on O
immigration O

social O

precarious O

finally O
there O
is O
an O
advantage O
to O

I O

once O

Hardball B-WORK_OF_ART

More O
on O
that O
congressional O
race O
in O
Ohio B-GPE
and O
what O
it O
means O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
country O
/. O

We O
're O
joined O
right O
now O
by O
Ohio B-GPE
Democratic B-NORP
congressman O
Sherrod B-PERSON
Brown I-PERSON
and O
Ohio B-GPE
's O
Republican B-NORP
Secretary O
of O
State B-ORG
Ken B-PERSON
Blackwell I-PERSON
who O
's O
also O
a O
candidate O
for O
governor O
who O
is O
in O
fact O
a O
candidate O
for O
governor O
/. O

Uh O
Mr. O
Secretary O
thank O
you O
very O
much O
Ken B-PERSON
for O
coming O
on O
the O
show O
/. O

You O
're O
running O
for O
governor O
/. O

Are O
you O
worried O
that O
this O
uh O
strongly O
Republican B-NORP
district O
uh O
barely O
came O
through O
for O
the O
Republican B-NORP
candidate O
against O
an O
anti-war O
Democrat B-NORP
/? O

you O
know O
I O
think O
it O
was O
a O
wake O
- O
up O
call O
particularly O
for O
those O
Republicans B-NORP
that O
campaign O
like O
Ronald B-PERSON
Reagan I-PERSON
and O
then O
govern O
like O
Mike B-PERSON
Dukakis I-PERSON
/. O

Uh O
what O
the O
base O
is O
saying O
is O
that O
we O
expect O
you O
to O
get O
up O
every B-TIME
morning I-TIME
and O
be O
who O
you O
say O
you O
are O
and O
do O
what O
you O
say O
you O
're O
going O
to O
do O
/. O

And O
I O
think O
that O
is O
a O
wake O
- O
up O
call O
/. O

And O
if O
the B-ORG
Republican I-ORG
party I-ORG
uh O
grasps O
that O
then O
we O
will O
go O
about O
the O
business O
of O
reestablishing O
the O
line O
of O
distinction O
between O
Republicans B-NORP
and O
Democrats B-NORP
particularly O
on O
fiscal O
matters O
because O
the O
Democrats B-NORP
do O
n't O
represent O
change O
/. O

they O
're O
not O
saying O
they O
want O
to O
cut O
taxes O
and O
grow O
out O
our O
economy O
and O
create O
jobs O
/. O

They O
're O
not O
saying O
they O
want O
a O
right O
- O
sized O
government O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
we O
check O
runaway O
state O
government O
spending O
and O
put O
more O
emphasis O
on O
the O
private O
sector O
/. O

So O
they O
do O
n't O
represent O
any O
change O
but O
the O
change O
of O
being O
from O
the O
outside O
to O
the O
inside O
/. O

And O
so O
Republicans B-NORP
that O
are O
going O
to O
be O
successful O
next B-DATE
year I-DATE
are O
Republicans B-NORP
that O
show O
a O
real O
distinction O
between O
the O
status O
quo O
and O
getting O
our O
economy O
moving O
again O
by O
cutting O
taxes O
and O
right O
- O
sizing O
government O
/. O

Okay O
let O
's O
go O
to O
Sherrod B-PERSON
Brown I-PERSON
/. O

Thank O
you O
congressman O
/. O

uh O
I O
think O
the O
Secretary O
of O
State B-ORG
of O
your O
state O
seems O
like O
he O
's O
trashing O
George B-PERSON
Bush I-PERSON
who O
's O
running O
a O
half B-MONEY
trillion I-MONEY
dollar I-MONEY
deficit O
for O
not O
being O
a O
real O
conservative O
/. O

Yeah O
I O
look O
at O
who O
conservatives O
really O
are O
/. O

what O
I O
always O
learned O
was O
that O
they O
wanted O
smaller O
government O
uh O
not O
no O
national O
debt O
and O
they O
wanted O
to O
stay O
out O
of O
foreign O
entanglements O
/. O

and O
we O
're O
seeing O
exactly O
the O
opposite O
/. O

But O
what O
happened O
in O
southwest O
Ohio B-GPE
Secretary O
Blackwell B-PERSON
's O
right O
/. O

it O
's O
a O
wake O
- O
up O
call O
with O
a O
message O
/. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
Mike B-PERSON
Dukakis I-PERSON
has O
to O
do O
with O
it O
/. O

But O
the O
message O
clearly O
is O
that O
the O
ethical O
problems O
in O
Columbus B-GPE
the O
ties O
of O
this O
candidate O
that O
barely O
squeaked O
through O
this O
election O
when O
George B-PERSON
Bush I-PERSON
carried O
that O
district O
two B-CARDINAL
to O
one B-CARDINAL
and O
the O
former O
congressman O
carried O
it O
almost O
three B-CARDINAL
to O
one B-CARDINAL
the O
ties O
she O
had O
to O
Secretary O
Blackwell B-PERSON
to O
Governor O
Taft B-PERSON
to O
President O
Bush B-PERSON
/- O

President O
Bush B-PERSON
made O
rowboat O
calls O
in O
to O
every O
Republican B-NORP
voter O
in O
that O
district O
/. O

and O
she O
barely O
won O
/. O

I O
think O
that O
's O
the O
message O
that O
/- O

What O
does O
that O
mean O
in O
Ohio B-GPE
/? O

I O
would O
n't O
want O
to O
be O
on O
the O
ballot O
next B-DATE
year I-DATE
running O
for O
governor O
if O
I O
were O
Ken B-PERSON
Blackwell I-PERSON
or O
anyone O
else O
/. O

Did O
you O
associate O
uh O
/- O

I O
'm O
not O
sure O
/- O

not O
much O
internationally O
/. O

Congressman O
do O
you O
associate O
with O
the O
remarks O
of O
uh O
Paul B-PERSON
Hackett I-PERSON
the O
fellow O
who O
lost O
the O
race O
last B-TIME
night I-TIME
who O
used O
terms O
like O
son O
of O
a O
bitch O
and O
chicken O
hawk O
/? O

Do O
you O
think O
those O
are O
appropriate O
terms O
to O
refer O
to O
the O
President O
of O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
with O
/? O

Well O
I O
think O
that O
uh O
Mr. O
Hackett B-PERSON
/- O

Considering O
he O
was O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
he O
did O
n't O
think O
the O
war O
was O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
begin O
with O
/. O

He O
stood O
with O
his O
commander O
in O
chief O
/. O

He O
has O
heard O
the O
President O
and O
the O
Vice O
President O
accuse O
uh O
people O
who O
disagree O
with O
his O
war O
policy O
like O
Paul B-PERSON
Hackett I-PERSON
/. O

has O
accused O
them O
of O
not O
being O
patriotic O
/. O

I O
think O
whatever O
Mr. O
Hackett B-PERSON
said O
was O
understandable O
/. O

But O
the O
issue O
is O
that O
Paul B-PERSON
Hackett I-PERSON
ran O
incredibly O
well O
when O
George B-PERSON
Bush I-PERSON
put O
his O
name O
on O
the O
line O
and O
Bob B-PERSON
Taft I-PERSON
put O
his O
name O
on O
the O
line O
in O
that O
district O
/. O

And O
that O
tells O
you O
then O
the O
problems O
that O
both O
the O
national O
and O
state O
Republicans B-NORP
have O
/. O

Okay O
let O
me O
go O
to O
Secretary O
of O
State B-ORG
Ken B-PERSON
Blackwell I-PERSON
/. O

Mr. O
Secretary O
are O
you O
happy O
as O
a O
candidate O
for O
governor O
of O
Ohio B-GPE
with O
the O
way O
this O
war O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
has O
been O
fought O
by O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE

Are O
you O
happy O
with O
the O
progress O
and O
prosecution O
of O
this O
war O

First O
Chris B-PERSON
let O
me O
say O
that O
my O
heart O
aches O
for O
the O
twenty B-CARDINAL
families O
that O
lost O
loved O
ones O
in O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
forty I-DATE
eight I-DATE
hours I-DATE
/. O

Uh O
Marines B-NORP
are O
from O
the O
state O
of O
Ohio B-GPE
/. O

Uh O
what O
I O
am O
for O
is O
firm O
resolution O
and O
a O
strategy O
that O
will O
lead O
us O
to O
victory O
/. O

I O
think O
the O
President O
, O
I O
think O
the O
Secretary O
of O
Defense B-ORG
and O
all O
others O
who O
are O
responsible O
for O
offering O
that O
sort O
of O
leadership O
in O
this O
country O
have O
those O
same O
objectives O
/. O

And O
I O
think O
to O
try O
to O
undercut O
that O
resolve O
and O
to O
second B-ORDINAL
- O
guess O
the O
Commander O
in O
Chief O
is O
a O
mistake O
/. O

Let O
me O
just O
say O
to O
you O
Chris B-PERSON
that O
what O
I O
said O
was O
that O
Ronald B-PERSON
Reagan I-PERSON
and O
George B-PERSON
Bush I-PERSON
cut O
taxes O
and O
they O
started O
to O
restrain O
state O
government O
spending O
/. O

What O
has O
happened O
in O
the O
state O
of O
Ohio B-GPE
is O
that O
Bob B-PERSON
Taft I-PERSON
has O
increased O
spending O
and O
he O
has O
in O
fact O
raised O
taxes O
/. O

And O
I O
think O
that O
anybody O
that O
runs O
on O
a O
tax O
raising O
runaway O
spending O
platform O
is O
going O
to O
lose O
because O
they O
're O
going O
to O
undercut O
our O
base O
/. O

And O
let O
me O
say O
to O
the O
congressman O
that O
the B-ORG
Oversight I-ORG
Committee I-ORG

the B-ORG
Bureau I-ORG
of I-ORG
Worker I-ORG

all O
the O

five B-CARDINAL

two B-CARDINAL

one B-CARDINAL

know O

one B-CARDINAL

the O

a O
bipartisan O

that O
's O
going O
to O
take O
responsible O
and O
bipartisan O
leadership O
to O
get O
involved O

And O
I O
think O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
step O
to O
getting O
towards O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
scandal O
in O
Columbus B-GPE

They O
saw O

from O

Uh O
uh O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
things O
that O
they O
got O

uh O
they O
visited O
an O
exercise O
cage O

a O
concrete O

chain O

Through O
the O

you O
could O

one B-CARDINAL
uh O
detainee O
as O
they O
call O

There O
was O
a O
soccer O

there O

Uh O
they O
sort O

get O
um O
uh O
a O
feel O

what O
uh O

we O

we O

that B-TIME

at O
night B-TIME

when O
it O

dark O

they O
ca O
n't O
see O
uh O
anything O

But O
as O
you O
suggested O
there O

a O
bunch O

these O

more B-CARDINAL

Uh O
that O
's O
such O
a O
regular O
thing O
down O
there O

we O
went O
into O

one B-CARDINAL

I O

you O

there O

a O

they O

go O

it O

the O
idea O

to O
show O
uh O

the O
better O
part O

what O
's O
happening O
there O

Each O

what O

I O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
have O
seen O
a O

they O
're O

Um O
uh O
we O
did O
n't O
talk O
to O
any O
detainees O
/. O

The O
uh O
congressmen O
uh O
who O
had O
security O
clearances O
did O
see O
a O
brief O
uh O
interrogation O
/. O

and O
uh O
the O
military O
said O
it O
was O
authentic O
/. O

Uh O
basically O
it O
was O
an O
inmate O
who O
was O
arguing O
that O
he O
wanted O

uh O
get O

He O
fought O

he O
was O
arguing O
to O
get O
back O

But O
they O
make O
a O
big O
deal O
about O
how O

how O

the O

lasts O

Well O
now O
the B-ORG
House I-ORG
uh I-ORG
Government I-ORG
Reform I-ORG
Committee I-ORG
which O
held O
those O

Congressman O
Steven B-PERSON
Lynch I-PERSON

Massachusetts B-GPE

a O
member O

is O

Congressman O
Lynch B-PERSON
are O
you O
uh O
uh O
/- O

uh O
you O
want O
to O
get O
a O
hold O
of O
those O
documents O
those O
drug O
test O
results O
right O
from O
Palmeiro B-PERSON
/? O

Certainly O
uh O
it O
would O
answer O
the O
question O
that O
Mr. O
Canseco B-PERSON
has O
raised O
about O
how O
long O
uh O
it O
was O
in O
his O
system O
and O
whether O
or O
not O
it O
was O
from O
a O
residual O
use O
/. O

What O
difference O
does O
it O
make O
whether O
he O
lied O
before O
and O
was O
using O
before O
and O
is O
found O
out O
now O
or O
he O
's O
been O
using O
lately O
/? O

Well O
if O
he O
was O
using O
steroids O
during O
his O
testimony O
or O
prior O
to O
his O
testimony O
obviously O
he O
has O
committed O
perjury O
and O
has O
tried O
to O
mislead O
the O
Congress B-ORG
in O
an O
ongoing O
investigation O
/. O

So O
uh O
it O
has O
uh O
a O
lot O
to O
do O
about O
what O
happens O
next O
/. O

Would O
you O
like O
to O
see O
him O
charged O
with O
perjury O
uh O
if O
there O
's O
evidence O
now O
hard O
evidence O
to O
a O
drug O
test O
that O
he O
was O
in O
fact O
using O
steroids O
back O
then O
before O
the O
testimony O
/? O

Because O
there O
's O
only O
two B-CARDINAL
options O
here O
as O
you O
point O
out O
/. O

and O
you O
elucidate O
this O
/. O

If O
he O
's O
used O
the O
drugs O
and O
never O
used O
them O
before O
since O
the O
hearings O
that O
's O
almost O
insane O
to O
think O
he O
did O
that O
/. O

Yeah O
/. O

So O
uh O
his O
defense O
or O
the O
defense O
that O
Canseco B-PERSON
offered O
on O
this O
show O
last B-TIME
night I-TIME
was O
that O
he O
may O
have O
used O
them O
a O
while O
ago O
in O
other O
words O
before O
he O
testified O
that O
he O
never O
had O
, O
therefore O
he O
's O
guilty O
of O
perjury O
/. O

Right O
/. O

I O
'm O
not O
sure O
if O
Canseco B-PERSON
is O
just O
offering O
his O
opinion O
uh O
uh O
/. O

Certainly O
Palmeiro B-PERSON
never O
contested O
the O
positive O
result O
on O
the O
test O
/. O

Uh O
so O
we O
have O
n't O
actually O
got O
him O
in O
/. O

He O
's O
agreed O
today B-DATE
verbally O
to O
release O
all O
the O
documents O
/. O

However O
I O
believe O
that O
the O
committee O
needs O
to O
get O
a O
similar O
release O
from O
the O
union O
because O
the O
confidentiality O
agreement O
is O
part O
of O
a O
collective O
bargaining O
agreement O
/. O

so O
we O
need O
to O
go O
to O
that O
step O
as O
well O
/. O

Yeah O
but O
assuming O
you O
get O
by O
that O
step O
do O
you O
think O
this O
guy O
should O
be O
hit O
with O
a O
perjury O
charge O
/? O

Well O
if O
he O
meets O
the O
requirements O
yes O
/. O

We O
're O
trying O
to O
protect O
the O
process O
/. O

When O
people O
come O
before O
Congress B-ORG
and O
they O
are O
sworn O
to O
testify O
truthfully O
there O
has O
to O
be O
consequences O
when O
they O
do O
not O
do O
so O
/. O

So O
this O
is O
about O
the O
integrity O
of O
the O
congressional O
process O
/. O

This O
is O
not O
about O
going O
after O
Mr. O
Palmeiro B-PERSON

We O
had O

there O

in O
this O

But O
that O
's O
not O
the O
typical O
position O

No O
/. O

They O
usually O
want O
a O
strong O
anti-drug O
policy O
to O
make O
a O
better O

Well O
of O

it O

also O
for O

But O
let O
's O
get O
back O
to O
MLB B-ORG
Major B-ORG
League I-ORG
Baseball I-ORG
/. O

do O
you O
believe O
the O
whole O
major O
league O
uh O
establishment O
has O
been O
benefitting O
from O
all O
these O
homeruns O
all B-DATE
these I-DATE
years I-DATE
and O
big O
muscles O
that O
produce O
these O
homeruns O
/? O

Absolutely O
/. O

Following O
the O
strike O
I O
think O
the O
thing O
that O
brought O
people O
back O
to O
baseball O
was O
the O
big O
homerun O
contest O
between O
Sosa B-PERSON
and O
Maguire B-PERSON
eh O
. O
and O
in O
a O
very O
real O
way O
steroid O
use O
/. O

if O
those O
two B-CARDINAL
gentlemen O
uh O
you O
know O
were O
guilty O
of O
it O
and O
there O
's O
some O
evidence O
that O
they O
were O
uh O
they O
put O
people O
back O
into O
the O
seats O
/. O

So O
baseball O
is O
benefitting O
by O
the O
performance O
enhancement O
of O
the O
individual O
players O
which O
makes O
it O
even O
more O
troublesome O
in O
terms O
of O
eradicating O
steroid O
use O
/. O

Congressman O
when O
you O
and O
I O
were O
growing O
up O
in O
the B-DATE
fifties I-DATE

sixties I-DATE
baseball O
players O
were O
skinny O

Do O
you O

was O

so O
strong O

I O

I O

and O
that O

the O
most O

and O
that O
is O
the O
proper O
role O

the O

It O
's O
a O
debate O
by O
the O
way O
that O
all O
of O
us O
went O
through O
at O
some O
point O
in O
our O

But O
Madame O

we O
talk O
all O
the O

about O
spreading O
democracy O

and O
your O

This O

most O
people O

live O

it O
's O
also O
a O
far O
cry O
from O
the O
Taliban B-ORG

This O
is O
a O
country O
that O
has O
come O
an O
enormous O
way O
in O
four B-DATE
years I-DATE
where O
yes O
the O
uh O
issues O
of O
the O
constitution O
are O
going O
to O
be O
debated O
in O
this O
very O
traditional O
society O
that O
is O
trying O
now O
to O
move O
to O
a O
modern O
political O
system O

I O
would O
just O
ask O
people O
to O
remember O
how O
hard O
this O
was O
for O
us O
/. O

Tim B-PERSON
I O
am O
I O
hate O
to O
say O
fifty B-DATE
one I-DATE
years I-DATE
old O
/. O

but O
it O
's O
in O
my O
lifetime O
that O
uh O
black O
Americans B-NORP
were O
guaranteed O
the O
right O
to O
vote O
/. O

Who O
are O
we O
to O
be O
uh O
uh O
eh O
so O
insistent O
that O
people O
must O
do O
this O
overnight O
/? O

We O
're O
working O
with O
the O
Afghan B-NORP
government O
/. O

They O
're O
moving O
in O
a O
democratic O
fashion O
/. O

It O
's O
going O
to O
be O
hard O
/. O

But O
when O
something O
arises O
uh O
as O
with O
Mister O
Rahman B-PERSON
it O
is O
the O
obligation O
of O
the O
international O
community O
and O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
and O
there O
has O
been O
support O
across O
Europe B-LOC
for O
this O
that O
the O
Afghans B-NORP
be O
reminded O
that O
in O
their O
own O
constitution O
they O
have O
enshrined O
the O
universal O
declaration O
on O
human O
rights O
which O
guarantees O
certain O
religious O
freedoms O
/. O

We O
did O
n't O
have O
that O
constitution O
with O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
to O
work O
with O
/. O

So O
Christians B-NORP
should O
be O
able O
to O
worship O
/? O

People O
should O
be O
able O
to O
convert O
to O
Christianity B-NORP
in O
Afghanistan B-GPE
/. O

of O
course O
Tim B-PERSON
/. O

eh O
the O
universal O
declaration O
of O
human O
rights O
is O
clear O
on O
this O
/. O

but O
I O
would O
have O
to O
say O
that O
Afghans B-NORP
are O
going O
to O
have O
to O
work O
through O
some O
of O
the O
difficulties O
and O
contradictions O
/. O

But O
it O
ca O
n't O
be O
done O
on O
a O
case O
by O

It O
has O
to O
be O

They O
will O
have O
to O
work O
through O

we O
have O
to O
interpret O
the O

They O
will O
have O

work O

I O
'm O
quite O
certain O
that O
the O
evolution O
of O
Afghan B-NORP

is O
going O
in O
the O
right O

But O
I O
would O
just O
remind O

that O
four B-DATE

the O
Taliban B-ORG

executing O
people O
wantonly O

And O
this O
issue O
could O
be O
very O
decisive O
as O
we O
play O
it O
through O
/. O

Well O
let O
's O
do O
n't O
forget O
one B-CARDINAL
other O
thing O
Tim B-PERSON
/. O

This O
was O
raised O
in O
the O
Virginia B-GPE
governor O

race O
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
by O
the O
republican B-NORP
candidate O
who O
went O
after O
some O
of O
these O
job O
centers O
that O
attract O
illegal O
immigrants O

Did O
n't O
work O

him O

so O
sometimes O
the O
emotion O
of O
the O
issue O
does O
n't O
always O
prevail O
/. O

Let O
me O
turn O
to O
Iraq B-GPE
the O
big O
discussion O
in O
our O
country O
about O
Iraq B-GPE
the O
way O
the O
issue O
is O
being O
covered O
by O
the O
media O
/. O

Uh O
Vice O
President O
Cheney B-PERSON
last B-DATE
Sunday I-DATE
made O
these O
comments O
/. O

There O
's O
a O
constant O
sort O
of O
perception O
if O
you O
will O
that O
is O
created O
because O
what O
's O
newsworthy O
is O
the O
car O
bomb O
in O
Baghdad B-GPE
it O
's O
not O
all O
the O
work O
that O
went O
on O
that B-DATE
day I-DATE
in O
fifteen B-CARDINAL
other O
provinces O
in O
terms O
of O
making O
progress O
towards O
rebuilding O
Iraq B-GPE
/. O

Secretary O
of O
Defense O
Rumsfeld B-PERSON
weighed O
in O
/. O

The O
terrorists O
seem O
to O
recognize O
that O
they O
're O
losing O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
/. O

I O
believe O
that O
history O
will O
show O
that O
to O
be O
the O
case O
/. O

Fortunately O
history O
is O
not O
made O
up O
of O
daily O
headlines O
blogs O
on O
the O
websites O
or O
the O
latest O
sensational O
attack O

And O
then O
this B-DATE
Wednesday I-DATE
President O
Bush B-PERSON
went O
to O
a O
town O
meeting O
in O
West B-GPE
Virginia I-GPE
of O
his O
supporters O
/. O

and O
here O
's O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
questions O
that O
was O
asked O
/. O

And O
I O
ask O
you O
this O
from O
the O
bottom O
of O
my O
heart O
for O
a O
solution O
to O
this O
because O
it O
seems O
that O
our O
major O
media O
networks O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
portray O
the O
good O
. O
They O
just O
want O
to O
focus O
/- O

Okay O
hold O
on O
a B-TIME
second I-TIME
/. O

They O
just O
want O
to O
focus O
on O
another O
car O
bomb O
/. O

or O
they O
just O
want O
to O
focus O
on O
some O
more O
bloodshed O
/. O

Does O
that O
issue O
work O
that O
it O
's O
the O
mainstream O
media O
that O
's O
distorting O
the O
good O
news O
that O
's O
coming O
out O
of O
Iraq B-GPE
/? O

I O
think O
it O
helps O
with O
the O
republican B-NORP
base O
/. O

but O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
helps O
with O
swing O
voters O
at O
all O
/. O

First B-ORDINAL
of O
all O
it O
's O
the O
nature O
of O
news O
/. O

I O
mean O
on O
the O
evening O
news O
at O
night O
a O
car O
that O
is O
n't O
in O
a O
wreck O
is O
n't O
in O
the O
news O
/. O

A O
house O
that O
does O
n't O
burn O
a O
building O
that O
does O
n't O
burn O
a O
killing O
that O
does O
n't O
take O
place O
/. O

News O
is O
the O
aberration O
is O
the O
change O
from O
normalcy O
/. O

Secondly B-ORDINAL
uh O
eighty B-CARDINAL
journalists O
so O
far O
have O
been O
killed O
over O
there O
/. O

Um O
I O
mean O
I O
mean O
getting O
out O
there O
and O
looking O
around O
wandering O
around O
Iraq B-GPE
looking O
for O
good O
news O
sounds O
to O
me O
like O
a O
good O
way O
to O
get O
killed O
/. O

And O
then O
the O
third B-ORDINAL
thing O
is O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
they O
really O
want O
to O
try O
to O
sell O
this O
because O
people O
do O
n't O
think O
uh O
that O
everything O
's O
fine O
/. O

I O
think O
this O
is O
just O
an O
extenuation O
of O
holding O
the O
banner O
that O
says O
mission O
accomplished O
/. O

The O
people O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
well O
/. O

They O
can O
see O
that O
it O
's O
not O
going O
well O
/. O

And O
what O
happens O
in O
fifteen B-CARDINAL
provinces O
does O
n't O
matter O
/. O

if O
they O
think O
that O
this O
thing O
is O
just O
really O
going O
to O
hell O
in O
a O
handbasket O
um O
I O
mean O
you O
know O
that O
's O
that O
/. O

David B-PERSON
Broder I-PERSON

The O

has O
a O
very O
thoughtful O
analysis O
of O
this O
question O
in O
the O
paper O
today B-DATE
which O
I O
would O
refer O
people O
to O
/. O

I O
think O
the O
answer O
is O
that O
when O
there O
is O
this O
level O
of O
violence O
and O
turmoil O
in O
a O
country O
that O
has O
to O

the O
heart O

should O
they O
dominate O
the O

It O
's O
a O
very O
weak O
argument O
/. O

when O
you O
have O
as O
Charlie B-PERSON
said O
journalists O
over O
there O
who O
can O
not O
move O
around O
the O
country O
to O
report O
because O
they O
know O
that O
they O
're O
in O
danger O

not O
good O

the O
other O
thing O
that O

interesting O
what O
you O

I O
was O

jump O

fact O

I O

obviously O
he O
did O

to O

She O
did O
it O

the O
point O

he O

a B-TIME

You O
know O

I O
understand O
your O
frustration O

we O

We O
ca O
n't O
tell O
them O

He O
pulled O
back O
somewhat O
from O
her O
comment O

and O
I O
think O
you O
're O
right O
Charlie B-PERSON
that O
they O
know O
they O
ca O
n't O
sell O
this O
and O
when O
they O
've O
tried O
in O
the O
past O
it O
has O
backfired O
on O
them O

But O
the O
President O
also O
said O
do O
n't O
be O
afraid O
to O
go O
to O
blogs O
and O
find O
out O
some O
more O
information O

Yes O
I O
mean O
I O

these O
are O
gradations O
here O
in O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
response O

But O
is O
the B-ORG

a O
little O
bit O

of O
course O
not O
/. O

They O
do O
it O
all O
the O
time O

uh O
and O
they O
complain O
all O
the O
time O
about O
what O
we O
do O

but O
I O
have O
noticed O
this O
past O
week O
Scott B-PERSON
McClellan I-PERSON
saying O
the O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
Press O
Secretary O
you O
know O
we O

blaming O

said O
that O
a O
couple B-CARDINAL

this B-DATE

so O
again O
they O
're O
being O
a O
little O
more O
careful O

did O
you O
really O
fall O

was O
that O
a O

completely O
inaccurate O

I O
wo O
n't O

off O

a O
difference O

uh O
David B-PERSON
Broder I-PERSON
let O
me O
turn O
to O
the O
rebellion O
that O
I O
sense O
with O
some O
House B-ORG
members O
uh O
particularly O
in O
the B-ORG

you O
go O

The O
conflict O
over O

Pennsylvania B-FAC

The O
harmony O

deference O
that O

the O
normal O

then O
this O

Congressman O

spokesman O

joins O
me O
uh O
now O
by O

/. O

Captain O
I O
'm O
sorry O
we O
keep O
having O
to O
talk O
under O
these O
kinds O
of O
circumstances O
/. O

Let O
me O
ask O
you O
first O
specifically O
about O
the O
tape O
/. O

You O
've O
seen O
the O
tape O
/. O

it O
looks O
horrible O
/. O

What O
do O
you O
make O
of O
it O
/? O

Well O
the O
tape O
is O
troubling O
/. O

You O
know O
when O
this O
was O
brought O
on O
yesterday B-DATE
morning B-TIME
uh O
the O
superintendent O
who O
was O
out O
of O
town O
uh O
assembled O
his O
senior O
managers O
including O
myself O
/. O

We O
had O
gone O
to O
see O
the O
tape O
/. O

and O
of O
course O
the O
tape O
was O
troubling O
to O
the O
point O
where O
we O
believe O
that O
the O
officers O
involved O
uh O
uh O
used O
more O
than O
was O
necessary O
/. O

Uh O
clearly O
we O
believe O
that O
Davis B-PERSON
was O
resisting O
/. O

However O
we O
believe O
that O
the O
force O
used O
by O
the O
officers O
was O
not O
acceptable O
based O
on O
department O
policy O
as O
well O
as O
the O
training O
that O
we O
give O
police O
officers O
/. O

Um O
and O
I O
should O
say O
you O
're O
on O
a O
cell O
phone O
so O
we O
're O
having O
a O
little O
trouble O
/. O

uh O
if O
we O
continue O
to O
have O
this O
we O
'll O
have O
you O
call O
back O
/. O

But O
uh O
Captain O
is O
it O
fair O
to O
ask O
the O
question O
are O
some O
on O
the O
police O
department O
kind O
of O
losing O
it O
/? O

I O
mean O
even O
when O
I O
was O
down O
there O
I O
saw O
the O
kinds O
of O
hours O
uh O
that O
people O
were O
working O
etcetera O
/. O

and O
I O
know O
that O
the O
goal O
was O
to O
give O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
some O
time O
off O
uh O
right O
after O
this O
happened O
in O
order O
to O
allow O
them O
to O
get O
their O
wits O
back O
to O
be O
able O
to O
relax O
a O
little O
bit O
/. O

But O
you O
know O
you O
look O
at O
this O
guy O
you O
know O
punching O
the O
one O
guy O
grabbing O
the O
AP O
producer O
you O
know O
/. O

these O
three B-CARDINAL
at O
least O
give O
you O
the O
sense O
that O
some O
on O
the O
force O
are O
kind O
of O
losing O
it O
/. O

Well O
I O
certainly O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
uh O
any O
kind O
of O
excuse O
the O
officers O
involved O
/. O

but O
you O
know O
police O
officers O
have O
been O
working O
for O
the O
last O
six B-CARDINAL
weeks O
uh O
under O
some O
very O
challenging O
times O
/. O

Uh O
but O
let O
me O
just O
say O
we O
have O
more O
than O
two B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
employees O
on O
the O
police O
department O
and O
certainly O
the O
incident O
that O
occured O
on O
Saturday B-DATE
night B-TIME
uh O
does O
not O
reflect O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
the O
hard O
working O
men O
and O
women O
of O
this O
department O
/. O

But O
um O
just O
so O
we O
're O
clear O
you O
are O
not O
defending O
the O
actions O
of O
those O
police O
officers O
, O
correct O
/? O

No O
I O
'm O
not O
/. O

otherwise O
I O
would O
n't O
have O
suspended O
them O
and O
have O
them O
charged O
with O
battery O
/. O

So O
no O
/. O

but O
clearly O
the O
police O
department O
/- O

When O
this O
was O
brought O
to O
our O
attention O
um O
uh O
quick O
and O
decisive O
action O
was O
taken O
/. O

And O
I O
think O
that O
's O
very O
important O
for O
the O
public O
that O
's O
listening O
to O
this O
or O
looking O
at O
this O
newscast O
that O
uh O
question O
answered O
that O
once O
these O
types O
of O
issues O
are O
brought O
to O
the O
attention O
of O
the O
administration O
what O
is O
the O
administration O
going O
to O
do O
/? O

And O
certainly O
um O
we O
have O
a O
zero O
tolerance O
for O
this O
type O
of O
behavior O
/. O

and O
when O
something O
of O
this O
magnitude O
occurs O
we O
're O
going O
to O
take O
the O
appropriate O
action O
/. O

and O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
swift O
and O
decisive O
and O
effective O
/. O

Captain O
final O
question O
/. O

the O
attorney O
for O
that O
man O
is O
saying O
he O
was O
n't O
even O
drinking O
uh O
that O
night O
/. O

You O
know O
anything O
about O
that O
/? O

No O
that O
's O
the O
first O
I O
've O
heard O
of O
that O
/. O

And O
again O
um O
everyone O
will O
have O
their O
day O
in O
court O
/. O

You O
know O
the O
officers O
are O
going O
to O
have O
their O
day O
in O
court O
/. O

Mr. O
Davis B-PERSON
is O
going O
to O
have O
his O
day O
in O
court O
/. O

and O
let O
me O
just O
go O
on O
to O
say O
how O
serious O
this O
department O
is O
about O
discipline O
/. O

the O
uh O
Associated B-WORK_OF_ART
Press I-WORK_OF_ART
producer O
did O
not O
want O
to O
press O
charges O
/. O

Uh O
the O
police O
department O
decided O
that O
we O
're O
going O
to O
pursue O
charges O
on O
the O
behalf O
of O
/. O

so O
uh O
that O
's O
how O
serious O
we O
are O
about O
making O
sure O
that O
our O
officers O
do O
the O
right O
thing O
/. O

And O
let O
me O
also O
add O
that O
you O
know O
there O
's O
not O
a O
police O
department O
in O
America B-LOC
that O
's O
not O
having O
personnel O
problems O
/. O

The O
question O
is O
again O
once O
you O
find O
you O
have O
problem O
personnel O
what O
do O
you O
do O
with O
them O
/? O

do O
you O
uh O
/. O

or O
do O
you O
deal O
with O
issues O
/? O

And O
we O
dealt O
with O
those O
issues O
/. O

Well O
look O
it O
is O
good O
to O
see O
uh O
that O
we O
're O
not O
hearing O
what O
we O
sometimes O
hear O
in O
these O
kinds O
of O
cases O
which O
is O
well O
you O
know O
you O
got O
to O
understand O
the O
circumstances O
and O
the O
tape O
is O
n't O
showing O
everything O
/. O

Basically O
you O
're O
saying O
look O
we O
took O
action O
/. O

it O
was O
unacceptable O
/. O

Captain O

how O

it O
work O

we O

if O
we O

we O
will O
ask O
the O

you O
think O
it O

fair O
do O

you O
Mr. O

to O
look O
at O
this O

any O

Uh O
uh O
this O
footage O

it O

actually O
first O
let O
me O
go O
to O
Joe B-PERSON

on O
that O
/. O

Joe B-PERSON
is O
that O
a O
legal O

could O
these O

come O
into O

say O
we O
were O
so O
traumatized O

everything O

happened O

it O
eventually O
led O
to O
this O
/? O

Yes O
Dan B-PERSON
quite O
frankly O
it O
is O
/. O

I O
mean O
it O
'd O
be O
unusual O
in O
a O
plea O
um O
sort O
of O
defense O
when O
you O
're O
defending O
cops O
because O
normally O
their O
mental O
health O
is O
not O
in O
question O
/. O

But O
in O
this O
instance O
it O
could O
be O
a O
defense O
/. O

and O
more O
importantly O
as O
a O
trial O
lawyer O
what O
it O
would O
really O
be O
called O

What O
you O
're O

a O

really O
no O
excuse O

it O

Um O
it O
was O
unjustified O
by O
any O
training O
manual O
across O
the O
country O
/. O

but O
what O
I O
just O
heard O
from O
that O
doctor O
from O
LSU B-ORG
and O
what O
the O
fact O
of O
the O
matter O
is O
is O
that O
these O

were O
working O

twenty B-DATE

he O
had O
clearly O
at O
that O

these O
are O

slept O
in O

twenty B-DATE

uh O
what O

I O
was O
dropping O
Taylor B-PERSON

Um O
she O
was O

him O

Ben B-PERSON

was O
their O
roommate O

And O
frankly O
I O
did O
n't O
get O
a O
sense O
of O
urgency O
at O
that O
point O
because O
I O
had O
no O
idea O

thought O
he O
was O
just O

it O

you O

there O
was O

any O
great O

I O
ca O

uh O
that O
uh O
Karl B-PERSON

I O
do O
agree O

a O
conservative O

the O
President O
after O

if O

you O

I O
think O

absolutely O
right O

The O
concerns O

I O
suspect O
that O
what O
Dobson B-PERSON
found O
out O

him O
to O
believe O
that O
she O
will O
vote O
the O
way O

do O
a O

it O

all O

at O
this O
time O
are O
claiming O
she O

not O
qualified O
are O
just O
looking O
for O
an O
excuse O

I O
assure O
you O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
them O
would O
welcome O
a O
poorly O
qualified O
but O
guaranteed O
hardcore O
conservative O
/. O

The O
far O
right O
is O
only O
resorting O
to O
talk O
about O
her O
judicial O
experience O
and O
qualifications O
because O
they O
want O
someone O
with O
experience O
that O
proves O
she O
'll O
vote O
their O
way O
not O
because O
they O
truly O
are O
concerned O
about O
her O
ability O
to O
uh O
evaluate O
constitutional O
issues O
/. O

It O
's O
almost O
humorous O
to O
hear O
some O
of O
the O
same O
people O
who O
regularly O
mock O
the O
so O
called O
elite O
point O
out O
that O
her O
law O
school O
SMU B-ORG
is O
not O
among O
the O
nation O
's O
most O
respected O
/. O

Now O
some O
on O
the O
left O
engaged O
in O
a O
similar O
type O
of O
dishonest O
attack O
during O
John B-PERSON
Roberts I-PERSON

confirmation O
process O

They O
could O
n't O
hide O
behind O
the O
cloak O
of O
inadequate O
qualifications O

After O
all O
the O
Harvard B-ORG
law O

for O
the B-ORG

a O

/. O

So O
instead O
the O
twenty B-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL
senators O
who O
opposed O
Roberts B-PERSON
claimed O
that O
they O
could O
n't O

about O

The O
reality O
they O
could O

would O
not O

conservative O
justices O

rebuke O

repudiation O
of O
the O
broad O
authority O
That O
the O

been O
claiming O

nine B-EVENT
eleven I-EVENT

Well O
first B-ORDINAL
and O
most O
importantly O
the O
decision O
did O
not O
require O
the O
President O

release O
the O

Nor O
did O
it O
require O
the O
president O

Correct O
/. O

It O
said O
that O
uh O
in O
order O
to O
try O
these O
individuals O
an O
appropriate O
thing O
to O
do O
would O
be O
for O
the O
President O
to O
get O
the O
Congress B-ORG
uh O

create O
military O
commission O

Or O
there O
were O
two B-CARDINAL
other O
options O

which O
I O
think O
were O
clearly O
unacceptable O
/. O

So O
what O
I O
think O
Congress B-ORG
will O
be O
doing O
is O
creating O
military O
commission O
/. O

And O
second B-ORDINAL
a O
very O
disturbing O
aspect O
of O
the O
decision O
was O
that O
the O
court O
held O
uh O
common O
article B-LAW
three I-LAW

Geneva I-LAW

this O
means O
that O
American B-NORP

potentially O
can O

accused O

I O
think O
Congress B-ORG

to O
deal O

that O
as O
well O
when O
it O
enacts O
these O
military O

And O
I O
think O
we O
need O
to O
do O
it O
soon O

uh O
and O
so O
we O
'll O
be O
dealing O

that O
in O

you O
have O
time O

you O

nothing O
more O

I O
think O
uh O
we O
will O
have O
to O
act O

very O
soon O

July B-DATE

in O

uh O
in O
the B-DATE

Senator O

will O
this O
be O
a O
bipartisan O
effort O

can O
you O
agree O

the O
fix O

think O
it O
will O

uh O

Had O

come O

Congress B-ORG
a B-DATE
few I-DATE

on O
this O
issue O
my O
guess O
is O
they O
would O
have O
gotten O
most O
of O
what O
they O
wanted O

But O
what O

happened O
here O

because O
there O
is O
such O
a O
view O
that O
the O
President O

power O
is O
infinite O
and O
unchecked O
by O
anybody O
first B-ORDINAL

ever O
a O

had O
those O
kinds O

keep O
running O

this O
case O
a B-ORG

has O
generally O

And O
so O
we O

not O

look O

this O

We O
're O

this O

undercuts O

of O

done O

on O
giving O
the O
President O
what O
he O
needs O

giving O
our O

going O

Well O
let O
's O
break O
it O
down O
here O
Because O
this O
ruling O
does O
indicate O
to O
some O
human O

that O
this O
applies O
to O
the O

Are O
we O
going O
to O
see O
a O
flood O

Senator O

Well O
I O
think O
clearly O
we O
've O
got O
to O
act O
/. O

And O
I O
'm O
pleased O
to O
hear O
that O
Chuck B-PERSON
thinks O
that O
we O
may O
be O
able O
to O
do O
this O
on O
a O
bipartisan O
basis O

I O
think O
it O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
this O
president O
has O
n't O
done O
anything O
with O
regard O
to O
enemy O
combatants O
that O
had O
n't O
been O
done O
by O
previous O
presidents O
/. O

The O
Court B-ORG
now O
has O
stepped O
eh O
eh O
into O
the O
field O
And O
said O
we O
must O
create O
these O
commissions O

Well O
we O
're O
happy O
to O
do O
that O
/. O

And O
I O
'm O
hopeful O
it O
'll O
be O
done O
on O
a O
bipartisan O
basis O
/. O

But O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
we O
're O
going O
to O
pass O
something O
that O
's O
going O
to O
have O
our O
military O
servicemen O
uh O
subject O
uh O
to O
some O
kind O
of O
international O
rules O
/. O

Of O
course O
not O
/. O

But O
we O
are O
signatories O
to O
the B-LAW
Geneva I-LAW

Why O
should O
n't O
our O
servicemen O
be O

but O
the O
enemy O
is O
not O
a O

the B-LAW

So O
why O
should O
these O
uh O
terrorists O
uh O
be O
subjected O
uh O
to O
something O
they O
're O
not O
signatories O

The O
good O
news O
Andrea B-PERSON
is O
that O
the O
Court B-ORG
particularly O
Breyer B-PERSON
's O
decision O
said O
Congress B-ORG
could O
change O
the O
rules O

And O
we O
have O
to O
change O
the O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
there O
's O
disagreement O
on O
that O
/. O

And O
we O
will O

Security O

have O
a O
tenuous O

careful O
balance O

this O

It O
changes O
from O

should O

But O
the O
problem O
here O
again O
/- O

you O
're O
right O
/. O

There O
're O
going O
to O
be O
hundreds B-CARDINAL
of O
court O

This O
is O
going O
to O
create O
huge O
discombobulation O
/. O

We O
're O
going O
to O
be O
far O
worse O
off O
than O
if O
the O
administration O
had O
come O
to O
Congress B-ORG
originally O
and O
gotten O
this O
done O
/. O

But O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
agree O
with O
Mitch B-PERSON
here O
This O
view O
that O
the O
President O
has O
the O
sole O
right O
based O
on O
the O
use O
of O
military O
force O
doctrine O
when O
none O
of O
this O
was O
even O
discussed O
or O
mentioned O
is O
the O
wrong O
view O

and O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
said O
it O

Andrea B-PERSON
could O
I O
just O
/- O

Senator O

should O
Guantanamo B-FAC

just O
be O
closed O

No O
I O
d- O
I O
I O
/- O

Because O
it O
's O
just O
been O
such O
a O
black O
eye O
diplomatically O

what O
are O
we O
going O
to O
do O
with O
these O
people O

I O
mean O
we O
want O
them O
to O
free O
them O
so O
they O
can O
come O
kill O
us O
again O
/? O

Look O
I O
think O
the O
Congress B-ORG
is O
very O
very O
likely O
to O
give O
the O
President O
exactly O
what O
he O
thinks O
he O
needs O
to O
continue O
to O
fight O
the O
war O
on O
terror O
/. O

And O
it O
's O
important O
for O
all O
of O
us O
to O
remember O
that O
we O
have O
n't O
been O
attacked O
again O

since O
nine B-EVENT
eleven I-EVENT

That O

It O
's O
not O
an O
accident O
/. O

The O
policies O
that O
we O
've O
pursued O
are O
protecting O
us O
here O
at O
home O
/. O

But O
is O
this O
Court B-ORG
ruling O
a O
strong O
signal O
to O
the B-ORG
White I-ORG
House I-ORG
that O
it O
should O
now O
agree O
with O
Senator O
McCain B-PERSON
Senator O
Lindsey B-PERSON
Graham I-PERSON
and O
others O
in O
your O
party O
who O
believe O
that O
it O
should O
go O
along O
with O
the B-LAW
Geneva I-LAW
Convention I-LAW
in O
terms O
of O
rules O
of O
the O
road O
for O
our O
soldiers O
/? O

I O
think O
Congress B-ORG
is O
going O
to O
be O
very O
reluctant O
to O
subject O
American B-NORP
military O
people O
to O
potential O
war O
crimes O
uh O
violations O
/. O

So O
John B-PERSON
McCain I-PERSON
is O
wrong O
on O
this O

Well O
we O
'll O
see O
/. O

we O
're O
looking O
for O
the O
administration O

advice O
about O
what O
they O
need O
to O
fight O
the O
war O
on O

My O
guess O
is O
that O
the O
Congress B-ORG
is O
very O
likely O
to O
give O
the O
President O
what O
he O
thinks O
he O
needs O
the O
tools O
he O
thinks O
he O
needs O
to O
protect O
us O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
quite O
that O
simple O
/. O

I O
think O
that O
there O
will O
be O
a O
careful O
looking O
again O
at O
what O
certain O
due O
process O
elements O
are O
that O
the O
Constitution B-LAW

the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG

has O
required O
in O
the O
past O
/. O

But O
giving O
the O
President O
the O
tool O
he O
needs O
yes O
/. O

But O
there O
's O
one B-CARDINAL
other O
thing O
that O
ought O
to O
be O
done O
Andrea B-PERSON
given O
the O
sweeping O
nature O
of O
this O
decision O
not O
so O
much O

the O
specifics O

what O
can O
be O

on O
how O
it O
ought O

I O
've O
sent O

for O

it O

as O
a O

let O

any O

making O

the O

Andrea O
let O
me O
say O
a O
couple O
of O
things O
/. O

First B-ORDINAL
you O
asked O
about O
a O
double O
standard O

There O
clearly O
is O
a O
double O
standard O

It O
's O
with O
the O
administration O

They O
leak O
things O
they O
want O
to O
leak O

And O
when O
the O
Plame B-PERSON
leak O
came O
out O
there O
was O
no O
outrage O

there O
was O
no O
high O
dudgeon O
/. O

In O
fact O
regardless O
of O
the O
criminal O
standard O
which O
uh O
special O
prosecutor O
Fitzgerald B-PERSON
is O
handling O
it O
's O
clear O
that O
there O
were O
leaks O
/. O

There O
's O
been O
no O
punishment O
no O
outcry O
etcetera O
/. O

I O
mean O
you O
ca O
n't O
have O
it O
both O
ways O

use O
leaks O
when O
you O
want O
to O

do O
n't O
use O
leaks O
when O
you O
do O
n't O
/. O

But O
there O
's O
a O
second B-ORDINAL
point O
here O
/. O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
difficult O
situations O
and O
clearly O
Iraq B-GPE
now O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
And O
uh O
this O
administration O
has O
a O
penchant O
for O
diversion O
and O
scapegoating O
/. O

And O
here O
's O
the O
good O
news O
the O
good O
news O
for O
America B-GPE

I O
think O
the O
good O
news O
in O
many O
ways O

They O
're O
going O

solve O
the O
problem O

problem O

deteriorating O

And O
I O
think O
the O
American B-NORP

are O
tired O

see O
through O
these O

real O
solutions O

Let O

you O

Campaign O
Chairman O

of O
presenting O
an O
alternative O

Let O
me O
say O
this O
/. O

I O
think O
what O
the O
American B-NORP

want O

for O
the O
Congress B-ORG
to O
hold O
the O

Now O
we O
did O
present O
an O
alternative O
The O
one O
that O
a O
vast O
majority O
of O
Democrats B-NORP
voted O
for O
including O
some O
who O
voted O
for O
the O
other O
one O
which O
said O
it O
was O
drafted O
by O
Senator O
Levin B-PERSON
and O
Senator O
Jack B-PERSON
Reed I-PERSON
of O
Rhode B-GPE
Island I-GPE
/. O

And O
it O
basically O
said O
we O
're O
going O
to O
tell O
the O
Iraqis B-NORP
in O
a O
period O
of O
time O
not O
public O
you O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
set O
a O
specific O
deadline O
that O
's O
what O
the O
resolution O
did O
n't O
like O
that O
we O
are O
not O
go O
this O
commitment O
is O
not O
open O
- O
ended O
and O
they O
better O
get O
their O
act O
together O
or O
they O
're O
not O
going O
to O
keep O
us O
there O
/. O

But O
make O
no O
mistake O
about O
it O
Andrea B-PERSON
/. O

A O
minority O
party O
in O
the O
Congress B-ORG
has O
a O
job O

The O
job O

one O

We O
are O

So O
to O

a O
general O
direction O
the O
way O
we O
did O
in O
the B-LAW
Reed I-LAW

Levin I-LAW
amendment I-LAW
is O
correct O

I O
think O
what O
the O
American B-NORP

are O
most O
upset O
about O
is O
the O
Republican B-NORP

is O
not O

with O
all O
due O

this O
Senator O

Oh O
I O
do O
n't O
buy O
that O
/. O

And O
this O
is O
what O
Senator O

to O

last B-DATE

about O
those O

I O
can O
tell O

the O
one O

I O
'm O
sure O
of O
Tim O

the O
American B-NORP

the O
United B-GPE

does O
n't O
get O
it O

the O
majority O

is O
out O

Dana B-PERSON
let O
me O
point O
out O
that O
The B-ORG
Washington I-ORG
Post I-ORG
your O
newspaper O
was O
behind O
the O
others O

also O
did O
publish O
this O
story O

And O
a O
story O
you O
wrote O
last B-DATE

disclosing O
the O
secret O

the B-WORK_OF_ART
Pulitzer I-WORK_OF_ART

But O
it O
also O
led O
to O
William B-PERSON
Bennett I-PERSON
sitting O
here O
saying O
that O
three B-CARDINAL
reporters O

won O
the B-WORK_OF_ART

you O
for O
that O

Jim B-PERSON
Risen I-PERSON

another O

not O
worthy O

worthy O

Dana B-PERSON
how O
do O
you O
plead O

Well O
um O
it O
's O
not O
a O
crime O
to O
publish O
classified O
information O
/. O

And O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
things O
Mr. O
Bennett B-PERSON
keeps O
telling O
people O
that O
it O
is O
/. O

But O
in O
fact O
there O
are O
some O
narrow O
categories O
of O
information O
you O
ca O
n't O
publish O

signals O

the O
names O
of O
covert O
operatives O

nuclear O
secrets O

Now O
why O
is O
n't O
it O
a O
crime O

I O
mean O
some O
people O
would O
like O
to O
make O
casino O
gambling O
a O
crime O

But O
it O
is O
not O
a O
crime O
/. O

Why O
is O
n't O
it O
not O
a O
crime O
/? O

Because O
the O
framers O
of O
the O
Constitution B-LAW
wanted O
to O
protect O
the O

that O
they O
could O
perform O

you O

that O

the O

the O
Winstar B-PRODUCT

Littlejohn B-PERSON

I O
'm O
a O
likely O
suspect O

I O

I O
was O

supposed O

A O

been O

His O

was O
used O
there O
at O
seven B-TIME

Further O
a O

Finally O
there O
are O
no O
witnesses O

other O
evidence O
to O
support O
Littlejohn B-PERSON

claim O
that O

visited O

Did O
you O

Imette B-PERSON

No O
I O
did O

Another O
problem O
of O
course O
is O
that O
he O
told O
the O
Daily B-ORG
News I-ORG

that O
he O
hardly O
even O
remembered O

I O
walked O

out O

All O
right O
so O
Janna B-PERSON
look O
this O
defense O
attorney O
is O
out O
there O
uh O
you O
know O
talking O
a O
big O
game O

saying O
I O
've O
got O
a O
solid O
defense O
here O
/. O

uh O
he O
took O
the O
subway O
home O

he O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
this O

Yeah O
and O
what O
's O
wrong O
with O
that O
/? O

He O
's O
going O
to O
present O
the O
uh O
some O
other O
dude O
defense O
did O
it O
/. O

And O
that O
could O
work O
in O
this O
case O
Dan B-PERSON
because O
we O
do O
n't O
have O
a O

of O
solid O
evidence O

linking O
Littlejohn B-PERSON

Imette B-PERSON
St. I-PERSON
Guillen I-PERSON

her O
murder O

Well O
you O
mean O
you O
're O
ignoring O
all O
the O
evidence O
that O
Ray B-PERSON
Kelly I-PERSON
's O
explaining O
/? O

No O
you O
know O
what O
/. O

because O
that O
evidence O
is O
weak O
at O
best O
/. O

I O
mean O
you O
could O
have O
an O
alternate O
explanation O
for O
all O
of O
that O
/. O

The O
fibers O
transference O
that O
's O
easy O
/. O

I O
mean O
it O
is O
/. O

Oh O
yeah O
/. O

No O
but O
listen O
/. O

if O
the O
theory O
is O
that O
she O
was O
raped O
and O
killed O
why O
is O
n't O
Littlejohn B-PERSON
's O
DNA O
all O
over O
her O
body O
/? O

We O
have O
no O
semen O
/. O

We O
have O
no O
evidence O
of O
rape O
/. O

I O
'm O
sorry O
/. O

have O
you O
not O
been O
involved O
in O
any O
cases O
where O
there O
were O
rapes O
where O
there O
was O
no O
semen O
/? O

eh O
It O
's O
highly O
unlikely O
Dan B-PERSON
/. O

Oh O
really O
/? O

Yeah O
/. O

I O
mean O
you O
know O
I O
'm O
not O
actually O
going O
to O
claim O
that O
the O
rapist O
was O
polite O
and O
used O
a O
condom O

and O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
was O
the O
case O
/. O

Hold O
on O
/. O

I O
/. O

Is O
there O
any O
evidence O

that O
/? O

No O
/. O

So O
uh O
at O
worst O
we O
might O
have O
a O
couple O
of O
people O
involved O
in O
this O
crime O
/. O

But O
we O
have O
no O
evidence O
that O
this O

raped O
her O

The O
theory O
is O
rape O
and O
murder O

All O
right O
I O
know O

/. O

but O
Gail B-PERSON
this O
is O
what O

do O

They O
change O

they O

we O

it O

not O

a B-PERCENT

the O
thing O
Dan B-PERSON
/. O

with O
all O

this O

not O

rape O

be O
an O
crime O

there O

the O

the O

to O
really O
be O
basically O
saying O
that O
your O

should O
be O
forced O

Exactly O
/. O

And O
on O
one B-CARDINAL
hand O
he O
basically O
says O
that O
he O
is O
uh O
you O
know O
appalled O
that O
a O

would O
do O
this O
to O
a O
child O

And O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
he O
's O
saying O
that O

you O

under O
twelve B-DATE

nobody O
likes O

even O

so O
um O
basically O
um O

needed O

um O
I O
have O
to O
tell O
you O
I O
've O
just O
been O
mostly O
shocked O

the O

really O
did O
not O

consider O

all O

you O

issued O

You O
know O
look O
I O
made O
a O
lot O
of O
comments O
yesterday B-DATE

saying O
that O
I O
thought O
that O
a O

suggesting O
that O
your O
son O
be O
forced O
to O

in O
this O

I O
was O
saying O
that O
the O

people O
who O
are O
usually O
out O
there O
yelling O

screaming O
for O
the O
victims O
we O

suddenly O

oh O
you O

do O

really O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
the O
victim O

this O

Exactly O
/. O

there O
was O
no O
one O

wanted O
her O

uh O
we O

at O
the O

spotted O

called O

asked O

I O
want O
to O
get O
your O
reaction O

My O
greatest O
regret O

the O
fact O
that O
I O
put O

that O

she O

what O
happened O
that O
she O
goes O

she O

why O

it O

she O
just O

no O

to O
stay O

I O
asked O

she O

she O
was O
brainwashed O

or O
is O
she O
saying O
she O
does O

know O

No O
she O
's O
basically O
saying O
she O
was O
brainwashed O

and O
her O
father O
feels O
she O
was O
as O
well O

um O
/. O

How O
did O
she O
come O
to O
then O
/? O

But O
how O
did O
she O
come O
to O
uh O
just O
recently O
/? O

Well O
she O
explains O
it O
as O
over O
the O
past O
ten O
months O
she O
had O
some O
more O
freedom O
to O
go O
out O
/. O

She O
started O
going O
out O
/. O

She O
volunteered O
at O
a O
church O
/. O

uh O
She O
was O
wearing O
a O
purple O
ribbon O
/. O

I O
asked O
her O
what O
that O
was O
about O
/. O

She O
said O
it O
was O
for O
Lent B-EVENT
/. O

So O
she O
was O
out O
and O
about O
in O
the O
public O
/. O

and O
she O
started O
making O
friends O
especially O
a O
man O
at O
um O
a O
deli O
/. O

And O
people O
kept O
questioning O
her O
/. O

How O
come O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
driver O
's O
license O
/? O

How O
come O
you O
did O
n't O
graduate O
from O
high O
school O
/? O

You O
do O
n't O
work O
/. O

You O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
job O
/. O

And O
she O
could O
n't O
really O
come O
up O
with O
the O
right O
answers O
/. O

And O
then O
She O
says O
finally O
she O
broke O
down O
and O
told O
this O
man O
at O
the O
deli O
everything O
because O
she O
just O
did O
n't O
have O
any O
answers O
for O
these O
questions O
anymore O
/. O

And O
she O
felt O
that O
she O
had O
people O
she O
could O
trust O
and O
that O
she O
could O
turn O
to O
/. O

She O
said O
her O
biggest O
fear O
was O
that O
if O
she O
tried O
to O
escape O
or O
if O
she O
told O
people O
they O
would O
n't O
believe O
her O
and O
she O
'd O
be O
out O
on O
the O
street O
/. O

She O
'd O
be O
living O
on O
the O
street O
/. O

Yeah O
/. O

And O
she O
did O
n't O
want O
that O
/. O

Well O
no O
question O
/. O

There O
's O
a O
lot O
unanswered O
questions O
here O
/. O

and O
uh O
we O
'll O
follow O
this O
to O
try O
and O
help O
get O
some O
of O
those O
answered O
/. O

not O

It O

deeply O

they O
chose O

in O

it O

you O

My O

uh O
If O
you O
can O
explain O
this O
to O
us O
/. O

Well O
Dan B-PERSON
there O
's O
really O
two B-CARDINAL
things O
at O
play O
/. O

In O
Afghanistan B-GPE
there O
is O
a O
power O
struggle O
going O
on O
between O
those O
who O
want O
to O
bring O
the O
country O
back O
into O
the O
community O
of O
nations O
and O
make O
it O
modern O
and O
democratic B-NORP
country O
and O
the O
Islamic B-NORP
conservatives O
who O
have O
really O
run O
the O
country O
uh O
for O
the O
last O
decade O
/. O

Even O
before O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
there O
was O
also O
an O
Islamic O
government O
/. O

and O
many O
of O
those O
same O
people O
are O
back O
in O
power O
/. O

And O
Afghanistan B-GPE
really O
represents O
something O
that O
's O
happening O
in O
the O
broader O
Islamic B-NORP
world O
which O
is O
a O
tension O
between O
democratic B-NORP
values O
on O
one B-CARDINAL
hand O
and O
Islamic B-NORP
values O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
/. O

I O
mean O
because O
the O
Afghan B-NORP
constitution O
article B-LAW
two I-LAW
point I-LAW
two I-LAW
says O
followers O
of O
other O
religions O
are O
free O
to O
exercise O
their O
faith O
and O
perform O
their O
religious O
rights O
within O
the O
limits O
of O
the O
provisions O
of O
law O
/. O

Seems O
pretty O
straightforward O
/. O

That O
's O
right O
/. O

uh O
And O
article B-LAW
seven I-LAW
of O
the O
constitution O
also O
cites O
the B-LAW
universal I-LAW
declaration I-LAW
of I-LAW
human I-LAW
rights I-LAW
which O
specifically O
says O
that O
people O
should O
have O
freedom O
to O
choose O
their O
own O
religion O
/. O

let O
me O
read O
that O
/. O

The O
state O
shall O
abide O
by O
the O
UN B-ORG
charter O
international O
treaties O
international O
conventions O
that O
Afghanistan B-GPE
has O
signed O
and O
the O
universal O
declaration O
of O
human O
rights O
/. O

That O
's O
exactly O
right O
/. O

But O
there O
are O
contradictions O
within O
this O
constitution O
/. O

Article B-LAW
three I-LAW
of O
the O
constitution O
says O
that O
no O
law O
shall O
eh O
contradict O
the O
beliefs O
or O
provisions O
of O
Islam B-NORP
/. O

And O
article B-LAW
one I-LAW
thirty I-LAW
of O
the O
constitution O
says O
that O
if O
there O
is O
not O
something O
specific O
in O
Afghan B-NORP
law O
that O
speaks O
to O
a O
certain O
situation O
then O
judges O
should O
use O
their O
interpretation O
of O
Islamic B-NORP
law O
/. O

In O
this O
case O
there O
is O
nothing O
in O
the O
Afghan B-NORP
criminal O
code O
which O
actually O
talks O
about O
the O
crime O
of O
apostasy O
or O
changing O
one O
's O
religion O
/. O

Well O
let O
me O
ask O
you O
about O
/- O

I O
mean O
since O
you O
were O
involved O
in O
helping O
them O
create O
their O
constitution O
and O
their O
law O
when O
you O
were O
helping O
them O
do O
that O
did O
you O
foresee O
something O
like O
this O
maybe O
happening O
/? O

We O
absolutely O
did O
/. O

uh O
and O
there O
were O
several O
of O
us O
who O
really O
advised O
strongly O
both O
uh O
to O
the O
Afghan B-NORP
government O
and O
the O
people O
drafting O
the O
constitution O
as O
well O
as O
our O
own O
government O
that O
there O
were O
some O
very O
potentially O
dangerous O
contradictions O
within O
the O
constitution O
/. O

um O
This O
was O
ultimately O
a O
document O
that O
was O
agreed O
upon O
That O
was O
drafted O
by O
the O
Afghans B-NORP
and O
agreed O
upon O
by O
the O
Afghans B-NORP
/. O

And O
in O
the O
final O
negotiations O
they O
actually O
made O
the O
document O
even O
more O
Islamic B-NORP
and O
made O
the O
judiciary O
even O
more O
powerful O
um O
than O
what O
the O
original O
draft O
has O
done O
/. O

So O
we O
did O
foresee O
some O
of O
these O
problems O
/. O

here O
's O
the O
president O
talking O
about O
how O
he O
hopes O
to O
deal O
with O
this O
/. O

I O
want O
to O
listen O
to O
this O
and O
then O
ask O
you O
if O
you O
think O
that O
they O
're O
going O
to O
be O
able O
to O
achieve O
this O
/. O

We O
can O
solve O
this O
problem O
by O
working O
closely O
with O
the O
government O
that O
uh O
we O
've O
got O
contacts O
with O
and O
will O
/. O

We O
'll O
deal O
with O
the O
issue O
diplomatically O
and O
remind O
people O
that O
there O
is O
something O
as O
universal O
as O
being O
able O
to O
choose O
religions O
/. O

It O
is O
hard O
to O
believe O
right O
uh O
as O
outsiders O
uh O
that O
this O
is O
a O
country O
that O
uh O
has O
been O
liberated O
by O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
uh O
that O
there O
are O
still O
many O
US B-GPE
troops O
there O
fighting O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
et O
cetera O
and O
somehow O
uh O
we O
now O
have O
to O
negotiate O
the O
right O
of O
citizens O
there O
to O
practice O
Christianity B-NORP
/. O

You O
're O
right O
Dan B-PERSON
/. O

it O
's O
a O
travesty O
um O
that O
something O
like O
this O
could O
happen O
anywhere O
in O
the O
world O
/. O

And O
I O
think O
that O
it O
really O
contains O
a O
very O
important O
lesson O
for O
us O
in O
that O
we O
really O
need O
to O
pay O
close O
attention O
not O
to O
just O
broad O
questions O
like O
elections O
but O
specifically O
the O
law O
in O
countries O
like O
this O
/. O

We O
could O
have O
worked O
over O
the O
last O
four B-CARDINAL
years O
I O
believe O
much O
harder O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
Afghanistan B-GPE
had O
a O
competent O
non-ideological O
and O
non-political O
judiciary O
/. O

um O
And O
we O
're O
really O
going O
to O
have O
to O
work O
very O
closely O
with O
the O
Afghans B-NORP
in O
the O
future O
to O
help O
them O
improve O
their O
judicial O
system O
/. O

Is O
it O
going O
to O
work O
/? O

I O
mean O
is O
the O
President O
going O
to O
be O
able O
to O
work O
on O
this O
diplomatically O
as O
he O
says O
and O
with O
the O
people O
that O
they O
have O
contacts O
with O
and O
resolve O
this O
/? O

I O
mean O
it O
sounds O
like O
what O
's O
going O
to O
happen O
is O
the O
government O
's O
going O
to O
declare O
this O
guy O
mentally O
ill O
/. O

Well O
I O
think O
that O
the O
government O
is O
really O
looking O
for O
a O
way O
out O
of O
this O
/. O

They O
have O
come O
under O
a O
tremendous O
amount O
of O
pressure O
/. O

and O
obviously O
when O
Secretary O
of O
State O
Rice B-PERSON
and O
the O
President O
weigh O
in O
uh O
this O
is O
of O
uh O
uh O
extreme O
importance O
at O
the O
highest O
levels O
/. O

And O
so O
I O
have O
little O
doubt O
that O
the O
Afghan B-NORP
government O
will O
find O
some O
way O
to O
wiggle O
out O
of O
this O
either O
by O
declaring O
him O
insane O
or O
perhaps O
quietly O
letting O
him O
slip O
out O
of O
the O
country O
to O
seek O
asylum O
elsewhere O
/. O

I O

only O
half O
kidding O

I O
really O

the O

uh O
yes O
he O
may O
be O
ruffling O
feathers O

to O
deal O

pretty O
hardline O
way O

uh O
well O
let O
me O
ask O
you O
this O
about O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
appointment O

he O
can O
only O
be O
appointed O
through O
uh O
the O

how O
can O
he O
really O

I O
think O

Uh O
It O
is O
a O
question O
that O
was O
posed O
to O
the O
UN B-ORG
secretary O

general O
today B-DATE

I O
mean O
the O
bottom O
line O
is O
that O
the O

has O
got O
some O
time O
to O
work O
with O
him O

He O
has O
a B-DATE

Everybody O
up O

that O

he O
can O
push O
the O
US B-GPE
agenda O

And O
then O
we O
'll O
see O
what O
happens O

I O
mean O
if O
he O
can O
prove O
to O
some O
Democrats B-NORP
that O
uh O
he O
can O
work O
well O
with O
others O
up O

perhaps O
he O
changes O
some O
minds O

Maybe O
uh O
that O
's O
not O
going O
to O
happen O
/. O

but O
the O
bottom O
line O
is O
that O
this O
is O
not O
an O
administration O
that O
thinks O
very O
highly O
of O
the B-ORG
United I-ORG

and O
the O
only O
real O
engagement O
we O
want O

to O
try O
to O
clean O
the O

up O

so O
they O
're O
going O
to O
stand O
by O
the O
guy O
they O
think O
who O
can O
really O
do O
that O

and O
this O
is O
very O
much O
a O
statement O
that O
the O
president O
was O
not O

deterred O
from O
making O
in O

views O

how O

fight O
for O
him O

the O
point O

naming O
him O
a O
recess O

I O
think O
huge O
/. O

in O
fact O
it O
's O
the O
vice O
president O

very O
close O

has O
been O
a O
real O
stalwart O
for O
him O

this O
process O

And O
I O
think O
it O
's O
perfectly O
clear O
uh O
that O
he O
made O
the O
argument O
to O
the O
president O
that O
you O
do O
n't O
wobble O
on O
this O
one O

that O
this O
is O

Kofi B-PERSON
Annan I-PERSON

I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
a O
mistake O
to O
simply O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON

a O
tough O
guy O

is O
going O

push O

around O

But O
he O
knows O
how O
to O
get O
things O

The O
moment O
for O

now O

and O
if O
we O
miss O
that O

shame O
on O
us O
/. O

Do O
you O
worry O
about O
him O
rattling O
the O
cage O

the O
head O

North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
with O
comments O
like O
he O

a O
tyrannical O

You O
're O
dealing O

a O

living O

most O
of O
the O

delusions O

Do O
you O

it O

safe O

call O
him O

You O
're O
not O

John B-PERSON

right O

Do O

Chris B-PERSON
Chris B-PERSON

you O

I O
should O

crazy O

He O
might O
hear O
this O

How O
about O
an O
unusual O
leader O
/? O

Eh O
everything O
that O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
said O
about O
Kim B-PERSON
Jong I-PERSON
was O
approved O
by O
the B-ORG
State I-ORG

There O

not O
a O

it O

a O

I O
sat O
through O
all O

read O
all O
the O

there O
's O
not O
a O
single O
thing O
that O
John B-PERSON

said O
that O
was O

higher O

Tyrannical O
dictator O
hellish O
nightmare O
on O
the B-DATE
eve I-DATE
of O
the O
six B-CARDINAL
nation O
talks O
/? O

That O
's O
what O
he O
is O
/. O

Oh O
yeah O
we O
know O
that O
/. O

The O
truth O
hurts O
so O
much O
with O
this O
guy O
/- O

So O
your O
listeners O
understand O
there O
's O
not O
a O
single O
thing O
that O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
said O
during O
that O
entire O
process O
that O
was O
not O
vetted O
, O
that O
was O
not O
cleared O
and O
that O
was O
not O
approved O

So O
he O
is O
a O
tyrannical O
dictator O
for O
whatever O
reason O
folks O
said O
/. O

that O
's O
the O
approach O
we O
're O
going O
to O
use O
/. O

and O
so O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
was O
n't O
off O
the O
reservation O
and O
was O
n't O
speaking O
out O
of O
school O
/. O

he O
was O
speaking O
truth O
/. O

and O
it O
was O
approved O
truth O
/. O

What O
do O
you O
think O
about O
his O
comment O
that O
we O
could O
lose O
the O
top O
ten B-CARDINAL
floors O
of O
the O
UN B-ORG
building O
and O
it O
would O
n't O
hurt O
/? O

I O
hope O
he O
does O
n't O
have O
an O
office O
on O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
those O
top O
ten B-CARDINAL
floors O
/. O

Uh O
yeah O
you O
sound O
like O
Barbara B-PERSON
Boxer I-PERSON
now O
Chris B-PERSON
/. O

You O
know O
the O
reality O
he O
was O
saying O
that O
comment O
to O
a O
group O
of O
folks O
/. O

it O
was O
a O
meeting O
in O
which O
they O
're O
talking O
about O
one B-CARDINAL
world O
government O
/. O

He O
was O
saying O
hey O
folks O
it O
's O
not O
going O
to O
happen O
/. O

Oh O
do O
n't O
/. O

no O
no O
/. O

now O
we O
're O
at O
war O
/. O

What O
did O
you O
just O
say O
/? O

Uh O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
so O
/. O

It O
's O
not O
going O
to O
happen O
/. O

And O
the O
bottom O
line O
is O
that O
a O
lot O
of O
folks O
would O
say O
the O
UN B-ORG
has O
not O
been O
as O
effective O
as O
it O
should O
be O
/. O

My O
investigation O
has O
shown O
mismanagement O
at O
least O
perhaps O
corruption O
at O
worst O
/. O

Right O
/. O

and O
so O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
folks O
saying O
you O
got O
to O
make O
change O
in O
the O
UN B-ORG
/. O

That O
's O
what O
that O
was O
all O
about O
/. O

And O
the O
UN B-ORG
recognized O
it O
now O
/. O

That O
's O
why O
they O
're O
holding O
this O
meeting O
on O
reform O
/. O

That O
's O
why O
the O
president O
is O
going O
to O
be O
speaking O
there O
/. O

And O
he O
has O
got O
a O
guy O
by O
his O
side O
who O
can O
help O
make O
that O
happen O
/. O

So O
I O
should O
n't O
have O
quoted O
him O
/. O

I O
made O
a O
mistake O
there O
Senator O
/. O

you O
just O
jumped O
on O
me O
because O
I O
quoted O
him O
saying O
it O
would O
be O
all O
right O
if O
they O
lost O
the O
top O
ten B-CARDINAL
floors O
of O
the O
UN B-FAC
/. O

and O
was O
I O
wrong O
to O
do O
that O
/? O

No O
/. O

it O
was O
a O
comment O
/. O

eh O
eh O
it O
was O
n't O
your O
quote O

it O
was O
your O
comment O

that O
you O
said O
how O
would O
you O
feel O
if O
you O
were O
on O
one B-CARDINAL

those O
floors O
/. O

Tell O
me O
what O
you O
should O
do O
here O
/. O

That O
's O
what O
Brabara B-PERSON

said O
in O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
our O

Oh O
did O
she O
say O
that O

Oh O
oh O
that O
was O
a O
mistake O
on O
my O
part O

Yeah O
absolutely O
/. O

wait O
and O
the O
reality O
is O
again O
the O
context O
in O
which O
he O
said O
that O
was O
very O
clear O
I O
think O
few O
would O
argue O
with O
it O
and O
that O
is O
we O
're O
not O
going O
to O
a O
one B-CARDINAL
world O
government O
/. O

The O
UN B-ORG
is O
not O
going O
to O
dictate O
American B-NORP
foreign O
policy O
and O
how O
America B-GPE
defends O
itself O
/. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
we O
need O
to O
work O
with O
the O
UN B-ORG
/. O

John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
has O
showed O
the O
ability O
to O
do O
that O
/. O

and O
I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
a O
mistake O
to O
mischaracterize O
him O
simply O
as O
a O
tough O
or O
a O
tough O
guy O
or O
a O
bully O
/. O

Did O
it O
bother O
you O
that O
when O
he O
filled O
out O
that O
questionnaire O
uh O
uh O
before O
your O
Senate B-ORG
Foreign I-ORG

that O
he O
failed O

it O
bothers O
me O
any O
time O
uh O
somebody O
says O
something O
and O
it O
turns O
out O
not O
to O
be O
accurate O
/. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
if O
he O
was O
simply O
somebody O
that O
somebody O
talked O
to O

there O
is O
n't O
any O
indication O
he O
was O
involved O
central O

the O
story O
I O
have O
less O
concern O

But O
does O
it O
bother O
me O
/? O

Yes O
it O
did O
/. O

I O
wish O
it O
did O
n't O
happen O
/. O

Do O
you O
think O
the O
UN B-ORG
can O
still O
play O
the O
role O
that O
FDR B-PERSON
and O
the O
other O
Americans B-NORP
at O
that O
time O
thought O
it O
could O

Chris B-PERSON

hope O

I O
think O
that O

the O

this O

effort O

That O

what O
this O

that O
we O
really O
do O
have O
to O
get O
rid O

the B-ORG
Human I-ORG

We O
have O
to O
change O
the O

they O
're O
not O
spending O
one B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL

sixty I-CARDINAL

nine I-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL

twenty B-CARDINAL

we O

we O
've O
got O
to O
do O
internal O

If O
it O

in O

the O
UN B-ORG
can O
live O

it O

supposed O

It O

'd O

More O
now O
on O
the O
recess O
appointment O
of O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON

the B-ORG
United I-ORG

NBC B-ORG
News I-ORG
chief O
foreign O
affairs O
correspondent O
Andrea B-PERSON
Mitchell I-PERSON
joins O
us O
now O
/. O

Andrea B-PERSON
there O
are O
two B-CARDINAL
paradigms O
for O
UN B-ORG
ambassador O
/. O

There O
's O
Adlai B-PERSON
Stevenson I-PERSON
the O
old O
liberal O
who O
really O
came O
through O
during O
the B-EVENT
Cuban I-EVENT
Missile I-EVENT
Crisis I-EVENT
because O
everybody O
in O
the O
world O
believed O
he O
was O
n't O
a O
hawk O
/. O

And O
then O
there O
was O
Daniel B-PERSON
Patrick I-PERSON
Moynihan I-PERSON
who O
went O
over O
there O
and O
took O
on O
the B-LOC
Third I-LOC
World I-LOC
on O
issues O
like O
uh O
the O
issues O
of O
anti-Israel B-GPE
sort O
of O
rhetoric O
over O
there O
and O
he O
won O
those O
battles O
/. O

What O
are O
we O
looking O
at O
here O
a O
smart O
diplomat O
or O
a O
tough O
talker O
/? O

I O
think O
a O
tough O
talker O
/. O

But O
what O
he O
needs O
to O
learn O
and O
what O
I O
think O
he O
's O
been O
warned O
about O
uh O
from O
diplomats O
up O
there O
is O
that O
you O
need O
votes O
/. O

And O
he O
ca O
n't O
go O
in O
with O
a O
mandate O
that O
the O
president O
has O
given O
him O
to O
shake O
the O
place O
up O
with O
some O
of O
those O
pungent O
sound O
bites O
and O
get O
along O
with O
enough O
people O
especially O
because O
his O
own O
credibility O
was O
really O
on O
the O
line O
on O
some O
of O
the O
tough O
issues O
that O
he O
's O
going O
to O
confront O
Iran B-GPE
Iraq B-GPE
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
/. O

So O
since O
he O
's O
been O
accused O
of O
twisting O
the O
intelligence O
on O
exactly O
those O
issues O
He O
needs O
some O
allies O
/. O

and O
he O
's O
going O
to O
have O
to O
develop O
those O
allies O
now O
/. O

He O
will O
have O
the O
Brits B-NORP
and O
some O
of O
the O
other O
traditional O
American B-NORP
allies O
/. O

but O
he O
does O
n't O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
goodwill O
up O
there O
/. O

That O
said O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
has O
experience O
/. O

He O
was O
very O
successful O
in O
a O
previous O
incarnation O
in O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
when O
he O
was O
able O
to O
defeat O
the O
Zionism B-NORP
is O
racism O
uh O
resolution O
there O
back O
then O
/. O

And O
he O
's O
a O
smart O
guy O
/. O

So O
I O
would O
n't O
bet O
against O
him O
/. O

What O
about O
the O
European B-NORP
and O
the O
world O
press O
/. O

are O
they O
going O
to O
destroy O
him O
before O
he O
gets O
started O
for O
being O
a O
recess O
appointment O
/? O

Sure O
but O
Kofi B-PERSON
Annan I-PERSON
look O
does O
n't O
have O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
strength O
himself O
especially O
with O
critics O
here O
in O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
/. O

So O
while O
he O
would O
like O
to O
warn O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
as O
he O
did O
today B-DATE
that O
there O
are O
a B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
ninety I-CARDINAL
other O
representatives O
the O
US B-GPE
has O
a O
certain O
special O
clout O
/. O

and O
Annan B-PERSON
is O
going O
to O
have O
to O
listen O
to O
him O
/. O

Uh O
I O
guess O
that O
if O
Bolton B-PERSON
had O
not O
said O
some O
of O
the O
things O
that O
he O
had O
said O
in O
the O
past O
that O
you O
know O
the O
UN B-ORG
secretariat O
has O
thirty B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
eight I-CARDINAL
floors O
and O
you O
could O
lose O
ten B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
without O
losing O
anything O
those O
kinds O
of O
quotes O
are O
going O
to O
kind O
of O
haunt O
him O
/. O

Do O
you O
think O
there O
's O
any O
danger O
in O
the O
world O
of O
causing O
a O
real O
war O
in O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
again O
another B-EVENT
Korean I-EVENT
war I-EVENT
by O
calling O
the O
North B-NORP
Korean I-NORP
dictator O
what O
he O
is O
/? O

I O
mean O
he O
calls O
him O
a O
tyrannical O
dictator O
/. O

and O
he O
says O
it O
's O
a O
nightmare O
all O
over O
there O
/. O

all O
true O
/. O

But O
here O
's O
a O
guy O
on O
Jack B-PRODUCT
Daniels I-PRODUCT
most O
of O
the O
time O
in O
a O
world O
of O
delusion O
/. O

Is O
there O
any O
chance O
he O
might O
just O
rattle O
that O
cage O
too O
hard O
/? O

Well O
actually O
Condi B-PERSON
Rice I-PERSON
herself O
in O
her O
own O
confirmation O
hearing O
had O
rattled O
that O
cage O
/. O

And O
they O
've O
walked O
way O
back O
from O
that O
/. O

What O
Rice B-PERSON
is O
proving O
as O
secretary O
is O
that O
she O
's O
much O
more O
pragmatic O
as O
secretary O
of O
state B-ORG
than O
she O
was O
a O
national O
security O
adviser O
on O
Iran B-GPE
and O
on O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
/. O

So O
she O
's O
taken O
this O
posture O
she O
's O
reflecting O
the O
president O
's O
view O
as O
adjusted O
for O
second B-ORDINAL
term O
and O
Bolton B-PERSON
is O
going O
to O
have O
to O
follow O
that O
line O
/. O

He O
ca O
n't O
really O
go O
off O
on O
his O
own O
/. O

And O
if O
he O
does O
I O
think O
she O
'll O
reel O
him O
right O
back O
in O
/. O

How O
many O
months B-DATE
before O
Condi B-PERSON
Rice I-PERSON
has O
to O
apologize O
or O
defend O
uh O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
his O

Maybe O
two B-CARDINAL

Okay O
thank O

I O
actually O

no O

twenty B-QUANTITY

and O
sweating O
through O
your O

trying O

stay O
hydrated O
um O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
sandstorm O
um O
where O
we O
were O
trapped O
on O
a O
couple O
of O
different O
occasions O
it O
was O
pretty O
grueling O
tough O
work O
and O
an O
assignment O
that O
made O
me O
have O
a O
tremendous O
appreciation O
of O
what O
our O
troops O
are O
going O
through O
on O
a O
day O
to O
day O
basis O
in O
Iraq B-GPE

what O
did O
you O
get O
from O
the O
Iraqis B-NORP

Do O
they O
like O
us O

Do O
they O
dislike O

Are O
they O
neutral O

Are O
they O
waiting O
to O
see O
who O
wins O

what O
/? O

I O
think O
that O
many O
of O
the O
Iraqis B-NORP
at O
least O
the O
ones O
with O
whom O
I O
spoke O
felt O
very O
strongly O
that O
they O
appreciated O
the O
American B-NORP
presence O
there O

They O
are O
obviously O
extremely O
concerned O
about O
the O
level O
of O
violence O
that O
is O
coming O
from O
the O
insurgency O
/. O

but O
there O
's O
a O
reason O
for O
it O
/. O

and O
you O
have O
n't O
heard O
this O
discussed O
in O
the O
mainstream O

because O
nobody O
has O
brought O
it O
up O
/. O

The O
reason O
why O
they O
are O
concerned O
is O
because O
they O
know O
that O
uh O
the O
constitutional O
referendum O
is O
terribly O
important O
/. O

the O
insurgency O
made O
a O
strategic O
and O
tactical O
error O
by O
not O
disrupting O
the O
last O
election O
back O
in O
January B-DATE
/. O

They O
know O
that O
it O
's O
coming O
time O
around O
/. O

But O
if O
those O
elections O
go O
successfully O
as O
the O
American B-NORP
military O
is O
hoping O

planning O
for O
as O
well O
as O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP

then O
we O
are O
going O
to O
start O
discussing O
the O
possibility O
of O
drawing O
down O
our O

And O
that O
's O
something O
that O
I O
learned O

reported O
on O
while O
I O
was O
in O

And O
it O
was O

ten B-DATE

your O
reaction O

Melanie B-PERSON

I O
think O
it O

great O

some O

headed O
over O

trying O

a O

I O

the O

what O
they O

how O
do O
we O
get O
the O
straight O
scoop O
on O
what O
's O
happening O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
because O
people O
tell O
me O
there O
's O
only O
two B-CARDINAL
ways O
to O
go O
over O
there O
as O
a O
journalist O
I O
think O
your O
experience O
confirms O
this O
you O
either O
go O
over O
there O
and O
stay O
in O
the B-LOC
green I-LOC
zone I-LOC
or O
that O
part O
uh O
uh O
which O
is O
very O
secure O
and O
it O
's O
basically O
a O
compound O
or O
you O
go O
out O
with O
a O
unit O
as O
uh O
basically O
part O
of O
the O
unit O
an O
embedded O
reporter O
/. O

You O
never O
really O
get O
to O
mix O
with O
the O
locals O
/. O

Uh O
how O
do O
you O
do O
it O
to O
find O
out O
whether O
we O
're O
actually O
winning O
the O
uh O
war O
over O
there O
/. O

Well O
that O
's O
exactly O
what O
I O
did O
/. O

I O
went O
out O
um O
and O
visited O
with O
the O
troops O
/. O

and O
I O
went O
outside O
of O
the B-LOC
green I-LOC
zone I-LOC
unlike O
uh O
Mr. O
Rieckhoff B-PERSON
has O
accused O
me O
of O
doing O
/. O

But O
outside O
that O
how O
do O
you O
get O
out O
there O
with O
the O
people O
/? O

Well O
because O
you O
get O
out O
there O
with O
the O
troops O
/. O

They O
take O
you O
in O
Humvees B-PRODUCT
and O
in O
armored O

Then O
you O
get O
out O
of O
the O
Humvees B-PRODUCT
/. O

and O
you O
hand O
out O
soccer O
balls O
/. O

and O
you O
go O
to O
orphanages O

and O
you O
talk O
uh O
and O
hold O
babies O

talk O
with O
the O
people O

are O
taking O

All O
of O
these O
things O
that O
fourteen B-CARDINAL

did O

do O

No O

Chris B-PERSON
uh O
let O
me O
just O
say O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
/. O

Before O
Mr. O
Rieckhoff B-PERSON
has O
written O
um O
that O
our O
group O
are O
a O
bunch O
of O
bigots O
idiots O
and O
propagandists O
/. O

and O
that O
's O
before O
he O
even O
cracked O
a O
sweat O
/. O

Now O
I O
want O
to O
tell O
you O
that O
there O
is O
something O
very O
important O
a O
message O
that O
is O
very O
important O
that O
I O
wanted O
to O
articulate O
here O
/. O

Our O
men O
and O
women O
are O
living O
and O
dying O
in O
ghastly O
conditions O
/. O

Uh O
it O
's O
hot O
a B-QUANTITY
hundred I-QUANTITY
and I-QUANTITY
twenty I-QUANTITY
- I-QUANTITY
five I-QUANTITY
degrees I-QUANTITY
/. O

They O
are O
making O
peace O
in O
sandstorms O
/. O

They O
are O
doing O
their O
dead O
level O
best O
to O
make O
this O
policy O
that O
the O
Bush B-PERSON
administration O
has O
put O
forth O
work O
/. O

I O
think O
that O
as O
an O
American B-NORP
people O
the O
stories O
that O
I O
tell O
from O
Iraq B-GPE
and O
that O
our O
fellow O
talk O
show O
hosts O
told O
um O
eh O
uh O
hopefully O
will O
engender O
a O
little O
bit O
more O
patience O
and O
endurance O
by O
the O
American B-NORP
people O
/. O

I O
think O
we O
owe O
our O
troops O
that O
/. O

Let O
me O
ask O
you O
the O
same O
question O
Paul B-PERSON
/. O

How O
do O
you O
get O
the O
the O
true O
scoop O
over O
there O
if O
you O
're O
always O
with O
the O
American B-NORP
troops O
/? O

I O
mean O
do O
you O
ever O
get O
to O
talk O
to O
the O
Iraqis B-NORP
/? O

Maybe O
it O
's O
just O
a O
catch O
twenty B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL
/. O

they O
're O
too O
dangerous O
to O
deal O
with O
/. O

But O
how O
do O
you O
get O
the O
story O
/? O

the O
reality O
is O
you O
do O
n't O
/. O

And O
I O
think O
Ms. O
Morgan B-PERSON
is O
really O
insulting O
all O
the O
troops O
who O
've O
been O
there O
to O
assume O
that O
by O
going O
for O
ten B-DATE
days I-DATE
and O
taking O
a O
few O
casual O
leisurely O
trips O
outside O
the B-LOC
Green I-LOC
Zone I-LOC
that O
she O
got O
a O
full O
taste O
of O
combat O
/. O

I O
think O
the O
reality O
is O
much O
different O
/. O

And O
if O
reporters O
really O
want O
to O
do O
some O
investigative O
reporting O
they O
can O
fly O
into O
Jordan B-GPE
and O
go O
unembedded O
/. O

Now O
there O
is O
a O
chance O
they O
might O
get O
their O
head O
cut O
off O
/. O

But O
that O
's O
the O
reality O
that O
we O
face O
as O
soldiers O
every B-DATE
day I-DATE
/. O

I O
think O
really O
the O
best O
way O
to O
do O
it O
is O
to O
talk O
to O
the O
troops O
coming O
home O
/. O

We O
're O
ready O
/. O

we O
're O
willing O
and O
able O
to O
come O
on O
your O
program O

others O

talk O

our O
experiences O

really O
try O
to O
educate O

the O
reality O

all O
sides O

this O
conflict O

Well O
guess O
what O

that O

exactly O
what O
we O
did O

We O
stuck O

We O

What O
I O
want O
to O
say O
is O
that O
we O
took O
our O
microphones O
to O
the O
US B-GPE
troops O
/. O

and O
if O
you O
think O
that O
what O
we O
heard O
from O
them O
are O
lies O
then O
you O
are O
accusing O
the O
troops O
of O
being O
liars O
because O
we O
did O
not O
filter O
or O
editorialize O
or O
in O
any O
way O

They O
gave O

and O
if O
you O
do O

believe O

Ma'am O

go O

Oh O
let O
me O
go O
Paul B-PERSON
before O

What O
I O
keep O
doing O
here O
is O
asking O
people O

off O

who O
come O
on O
this O
program O
high O

ranking O
officers O

Uh O
I O
get O
sometimes O

time O
two B-CARDINAL
different O
versions O
the O
version O
they O
give O
me O
on O

The O
version O

The O
version O
they O
give O
me O
off O
the O

is O
Rumsfeld B-PERSON
is O
crazy O
there O
are O
n't O
enough O

enough O

we O
should O

sometimes O

It O
is O
n't O
always O
a O
straight O

/. O

when O
you O
go O

they O
want O
to O
be O
loyal O

That O

exactly O
right O

Chris B-PERSON

what O
