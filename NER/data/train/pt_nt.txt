So O
, O
my O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
those O
chosen O
by O
God O
to O
be O
his O
holy O
people O
, O
think O
about O
Jesus O
. O

He O
is O
the O
one O
we O
believe O
God O
sent O
to O
save O
us O
and O
to O
be O
our O
high O
priest O
. O

God O
made O
him O
our O
high O
priest O
, O
and O
he O
was O
faithful O
to O
God O
just O
as O
Moses O
was O
. O

He O
did O
everything O
God O
wanted O
him O
to O
do O
in O
God O
's O
house O
. O

When O
someone O
builds O
a O
house O
, O
people O
will O
honor O
the O
builder O
more O
than O
the O
house O
. O

It O
is O
the O
same O
with O
Jesus O
. O

He O
should O
have O
more O
honor O
than O
Moses O
. O

Every O
house O
is O
built O
by O
someone O
, O
but O
God O
built O
everything O
. O

Moses O
was O
faithful O
as O
a O
servant O
in O
God O
's O
whole O
house O
. O

He O
told O
people O
what O
God O
would O
say O
in O
the O
future O
. O

But O
Christ O
is O
faithful O
in O
ruling O
God O
's O
house O
as O
the O
Son O
. O

And O
we O
are O
God O
's O
house O
, O
if O
we O
remain O
confident O
of O
the O
great O
hope O
we O
are O
glad O
to O
say O
we O
have O
. O

So O
it O
is O
just O
as O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
says O
: O
`` O
If O
you O
hear O
God O
's O
voice O
today O
, O
do O
n't O
be O
stubborn O
as O
you O
were O
in O
the O
past O
, O
when O
you O
turned O
against O
God O
. O

That O
was O
the O
day O
you O
tested O
God O
in O
the O
desert O
. O

For O
40 O
years O
in O
the O
desert O
your O
people O
saw O
what O
I O
did O
. O

But O
they O
tested O
me O
and O
my O
patience O
. O

So O
I O
was O
angry O
with O
them O
. O

I O
said O
, O
' O
Their O
thoughts O
are O
always O
wrong O
. O

They O
have O
never O
understood O
my O
ways O
. O
' O

So O
I O
was O
angry O
and O
made O
a O
promise O
: O
' O
They O
will O
never O
enter O
my O
place O
of O
rest O
. O
' O
'' O

So O
, O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
be O
careful O
that O
none O
of O
you O
has O
the O
evil O
thoughts O
that O
cause O
so O
much O
doubt O
that O
you O
stop O
following O
the O
living O
God O
. O

But O
encourage O
each O
other O
every O
day O
, O
while O
you O
still O
have O
something O
called O
`` O
today O
. O
'' O

Help O
each O
other O
so O
that O
none O
of O
you O
will O
be O
fooled O
by O
sin O
and O
become O
too O
hard O
to O
change O
. O

We O
have O
the O
honor O
of O
sharing O
in O
all O
that O
Christ O
has O
if O
we O
continue O
until O
the O
end O
to O
have O
the O
sure O
faith O
we O
had O
in O
the O
beginning O
. O

That O
's O
why O
the O
Spirit O
said O
, O
`` O
If O
you O
hear O
God O
's O
voice O
today O
, O
do O
n't O
be O
stubborn O
as O
in O
the O
past O
when O
you O
turned O
against O
God O
. O
'' O

Who O
were O
those O
who O
heard O
God O
's O
voice O
and O
turned O
against O
him O
? O

It O
was O
all O
the O
people O
Moses O
led O
out O
of O
Egypt O
. O

And O
who O
was O
God O
angry O
with O
for O
40 O
years O
? O

He O
was O
angry O
with O
those O
who O
sinned O
. O

And O
their O
dead O
bodies O
were O
left O
in O
the O
desert O
. O

And O
which O
people O
was O
God O
talking O
to O
when O
he O
promised O
that O
they O
would O
never O
enter O
his O
place O
of O
rest O
? O

He O
was O
talking O
to O
those O
who O
did O
not O
obey O
him O
. O

So O
we O
see O
that O
they O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
enter O
and O
have O
God O
's O
rest O
, O
because O
they O
did O
not O
believe O
. O

So O
we O
should O
be O
finished O
with O
the O
beginning O
lessons O
about O
Christ O
. O

We O
should O
not O
have O
to O
keep O
going O
back O
to O
where O
we O
started O
. O

We O
began O
our O
new O
life O
by O
turning O
away O
from O
the O
evil O
we O
did O
in O
the O
past O
and O
by O
believing O
in O
God O
. O

That O
's O
when O
we O
were O
taught O
about O
baptisms O
, O
laying O
hands O
on O
people O
, O
the O
resurrection O
of O
those O
who O
have O
died O
, O
and O
the O
final O
judgment O
. O

Now O
we O
need O
to O
go O
forward O
to O
more O
mature O
teaching O
. O

And O
that O
's O
what O
we O
will O
do O
if O
God O
allows O
. O

After O
people O
have O
left O
the O
way O
of O
Christ O
, O
can O
you O
make O
them O
change O
their O
lives O
again O
? O

I O
am O
talking O
about O
people O
who O
once O
learned O
the O
truth O
, O
received O
God O
's O
gift O
, O
and O
shared O
in O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
. O

They O
were O
blessed O
to O
hear O
God O
's O
good O
message O
and O
see O
the O
great O
power O
of O
his O
new O
world O
. O

But O
then O
they O
left O
it O
all O
behind O
, O
and O
it O
is O
not O
possible O
to O
make O
them O
change O
again O
. O

That O
's O
because O
those O
who O
leave O
Christ O
are O
nailing O
him O
to O
the O
cross O
again O
, O
shaming O
him O
before O
everyone O
. O

Some O
people O
are O
like O
land O
that O
gets O
plenty O
of O
rain O
and O
produces O
a O
good O
crop O
for O
those O
who O
farm O
it O
. O

That O
kind O
of O
land O
has O
God O
's O
blessing O
. O

But O
other O
people O
are O
like O
land O
that O
grows O
only O
thorns O
and O
weeds O
. O

It O
is O
worthless O
and O
in O
danger O
of O
being O
cursed O
by O
God O
. O

It O
will O
be O
destroyed O
by O
fire O
. O

Dear O
friends O
, O
I O
am O
not O
saying O
this O
because O
I O
think O
it O
is O
happening O
to O
you O
. O

We O
really O
expect O
that O
you O
will O
do O
better O
-- O
that O
you O
will O
do O
the O
good O
things O
that O
will O
result O
in O
your O
salvation O
. O

God O
is O
fair O
, O
and O
he O
will O
remember O
all O
the O
work O
you O
have O
done O
. O

He O
will O
remember O
that O
you O
showed O
your O
love O
to O
him O
by O
helping O
his O
people O
and O
that O
you O
continue O
to O
help O
them O
. O

We O
want O
each O
of O
you O
to O
be O
willing O
and O
eager O
to O
show O
your O
love O
like O
that O
the O
rest O
of O
your O
life O
. O

Then O
you O
will O
be O
sure O
to O
get O
what O
you O
hope O
for O
. O

We O
do O
n't O
want O
you O
to O
be O
lazy O
. O

We O
want O
you O
to O
be O
like O
those O
who O
, O
because O
of O
their O
faith O
and O
patience O
, O
will O
get O
what O
God O
has O
promised O
. O

God O
made O
a O
promise O
to O
Abraham O
. O

And O
there O
is O
no O
one O
greater O
than O
God O
, O
so O
he O
made O
the O
promise O
with O
an O
oath O
in O
his O
own O
name O
-- O
an O
oath O
that O
he O
would O
do O
what O
he O
promised O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
will O
surely O
bless O
you O
. O

I O
will O
give O
you O
many O
descendants O
. O
'' O

Abraham O
waited O
patiently O
for O
this O
to O
happen O
, O
and O
later O
he O
received O
what O
God O
promised O
. O

People O
always O
use O
the O
name O
of O
someone O
greater O
than O
themselves O
to O
make O
a O
promise O
with O
an O
oath O
. O

The O
oath O
proves O
that O
what O
they O
say O
is O
true O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
more O
arguing O
about O
it O
. O

God O
wanted O
to O
prove O
that O
his O
promise O
was O
true O
. O

He O
wanted O
to O
prove O
this O
to O
those O
who O
would O
get O
what O
he O
promised O
. O

He O
wanted O
them O
to O
understand O
clearly O
that O
his O
purposes O
never O
change O
. O

So O
God O
said O
something O
would O
happen O
, O
and O
he O
proved O
what O
he O
said O
by O
adding O
an O
oath O
. O

These O
two O
things O
can O
not O
change O
: O
God O
can O
not O
lie O
when O
he O
says O
something O
, O
and O
he O
can O
not O
lie O
when O
he O
makes O
an O
oath O
. O

So O
these O
two O
things O
are O
a O
great O
help O
to O
us O
who O
have O
come O
to O
God O
for O
safety O
. O

They O
encourage O
us O
to O
hold O
on O
to O
the O
hope O
that O
is O
ours O
. O

This O
hope O
is O
like O
an O
anchor O
for O
us O
. O

It O
is O
strong O
and O
sure O
and O
keeps O
us O
safe O
. O

It O
goes O
behind O
the O
curtain O
. O

Jesus O
has O
already O
entered O
there O
and O
opened O
the O
way O
for O
us O
. O

He O
has O
become O
the O
high O
priest O
forever O
, O
just O
like O
Melchizedek O
. O

Faith O
is O
what O
makes O
real O
the O
things O
we O
hope O
for O
. O

It O
is O
proof O
of O
what O
we O
can O
not O
see O
. O

God O
was O
pleased O
with O
the O
people O
who O
lived O
a O
long O
time O
ago O
because O
they O
had O
faith O
like O
this O
. O

Faith O
helps O
us O
understand O
that O
God O
created O
the O
whole O
world O
by O
his O
command O
. O

This O
means O
that O
the O
things O
we O
see O
were O
made O
by O
something O
that O
can O
not O
be O
seen O
. O

Cain O
and O
Abel O
both O
offered O
sacrifices O
to O
God O
. O

But O
Abel O
offered O
a O
better O
sacrifice O
to O
God O
because O
he O
had O
faith O
. O

God O
said O
he O
was O
pleased O
with O
what O
Abel O
offered O
. O

And O
so O
God O
called O
him O
a O
good O
man O
because O
he O
had O
faith O
. O

Abel O
died O
, O
but O
through O
his O
faith O
he O
is O
still O
speaking O
. O

Enoch O
was O
carried O
away O
from O
this O
earth O
, O
so O
he O
never O
died O
. O

The O
Scriptures O
tell O
us O
that O
before O
he O
was O
carried O
off O
, O
he O
was O
a O
man O
who O
pleased O
God O
. O

Later O
, O
no O
one O
knew O
where O
he O
was O
, O
because O
God O
had O
taken O
Enoch O
to O
be O
with O
him O
. O

This O
all O
happened O
because O
he O
had O
faith O
. O

Without O
faith O
no O
one O
can O
please O
God O
. O

Whoever O
comes O
to O
God O
must O
believe O
that O
he O
is O
real O
and O
that O
he O
rewards O
those O
who O
sincerely O
try O
to O
find O
him O
. O

Noah O
was O
warned O
by O
God O
about O
things O
that O
he O
could O
not O
yet O
see O
. O

But O
he O
had O
faith O
and O
respect O
for O
God O
, O
so O
he O
built O
a O
large O
boat O
to O
save O
his O
family O
. O

With O
his O
faith O
, O
Noah O
showed O
that O
the O
world O
was O
wrong O
. O

And O
he O
became O
one O
of O
those O
who O
are O
made O
right O
with O
God O
through O
faith O
. O

God O
called O
Abraham O
to O
travel O
to O
another O
place O
that O
he O
promised O
to O
give O
him O
. O

Abraham O
did O
not O
know O
where O
that O
other O
place O
was O
. O

But O
he O
obeyed O
God O
and O
started O
traveling O
because O
he O
had O
faith O
. O

Abraham O
lived O
in O
the O
country O
that O
God O
promised O
to O
give O
him O
. O

He O
lived O
there O
like O
a O
visitor O
who O
did O
not O
belong O
. O

He O
did O
this O
because O
he O
had O
faith O
. O

He O
lived O
in O
tents O
with O
Isaac O
and O
Jacob O
, O
who O
also O
received O
the O
same O
promise O
from O
God O
. O

Abraham O
was O
waiting O
for O
the O
city O
that O
has O
real O
foundations O
. O

He O
was O
waiting O
for O
the O
city O
that O
is O
planned O
and O
built O
by O
God O
. O

Sarah O
was O
not O
able O
to O
have O
children O
, O
and O
Abraham O
was O
too O
old O
. O

But O
he O
had O
faith O
in O
God O
, O
trusting O
him O
to O
do O
what O
he O
promised O
. O

And O
so O
God O
made O
them O
able O
to O
have O
children O
. O

Abraham O
was O
so O
old O
he O
was O
almost O
dead O
. O

But O
from O
that O
one O
man O
came O
as O
many O
descendants O
as O
there O
are O
stars O
in O
the O
sky O
. O

So O
many O
people O
came O
from O
him O
that O
they O
are O
like O
grains O
of O
sand O
on O
the O
seashore O
. O

All O
these O
great O
people O
continued O
living O
with O
faith O
until O
they O
died O
. O

They O
did O
not O
get O
the O
things O
God O
promised O
his O
people O
. O

But O
they O
were O
happy O
just O
to O
see O
those O
promises O
coming O
far O
in O
the O
future O
. O

They O
accepted O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
were O
like O
visitors O
and O
strangers O
here O
on O
earth O
. O

When O
people O
accept O
something O
like O
that O
, O
they O
show O
they O
are O
waiting O
for O
a O
country O
that O
will O
be O
their O
own O
. O

If O
they O
were O
thinking O
about O
the O
country O
they O
had O
left O
, O
they O
could O
have O
gone O
back O
. O

But O
they O
were O
waiting O
for O
a O
better O
country O
-- O
a O
heavenly O
country O
. O

So O
God O
is O
not O
ashamed O
to O
be O
called O
their O
God O
. O

And O
he O
has O
prepared O
a O
city O
for O
them O
. O

God O
tested O
Abraham O
's O
faith O
. O

God O
told O
him O
to O
offer O
Isaac O
as O
a O
sacrifice O
. O

Abraham O
obeyed O
because O
he O
had O
faith O
. O

He O
already O
had O
the O
promises O
from O
God O
. O

And O
God O
had O
already O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
It O
is O
through O
Isaac O
that O
your O
descendants O
will O
come O
. O
'' O

But O
Abraham O
was O
ready O
to O
offer O
his O
only O
son O
. O

He O
did O
this O
because O
he O
had O
faith O
. O

He O
believed O
that O
God O
could O
raise O
people O
from O
death O
. O

And O
really O
, O
when O
God O
stopped O
Abraham O
from O
killing O
Isaac O
, O
it O
was O
as O
if O
he O
got O
him O
back O
from O
death O
. O

Isaac O
blessed O
the O
future O
of O
Jacob O
and O
Esau O
. O

He O
did O
that O
because O
he O
had O
faith O
. O

And O
Jacob O
, O
also O
because O
he O
had O
faith O
, O
blessed O
each O
one O
of O
Joseph O
's O
sons O
. O

He O
did O
this O
while O
he O
was O
dying O
, O
leaning O
on O
his O
rod O
and O
worshiping O
God O
. O

And O
when O
Joseph O
was O
almost O
dead O
, O
he O
spoke O
about O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
leaving O
Egypt O
. O

And O
he O
told O
them O
what O
they O
should O
do O
with O
his O
body O
. O

He O
did O
this O
because O
he O
had O
faith O
. O

And O
the O
mother O
and O
father O
of O
Moses O
hid O
him O
for O
three O
months O
after O
he O
was O
born O
. O

They O
did O
this O
because O
they O
had O
faith O
. O

They O
saw O
that O
Moses O
was O
a O
beautiful O
baby O
. O

And O
they O
were O
not O
afraid O
to O
disobey O
the O
king O
's O
order O
. O

Moses O
grew O
up O
and O
became O
a O
man O
. O

He O
refused O
to O
be O
called O
the O
son O
of O
Pharaoh O
's O
daughter O
. O

He O
chose O
not O
to O
enjoy O
the O
pleasures O
of O
sin O
that O
last O
such O
a O
short O
time O
. O

Instead O
, O
he O
chose O
to O
suffer O
with O
God O
's O
people O
. O

He O
did O
this O
because O
he O
had O
faith O
. O

He O
thought O
it O
was O
better O
to O
suffer O
for O
the O
Christ O
than O
to O
have O
all O
the O
treasures O
of O
Egypt O
. O

He O
was O
waiting O
for O
the O
reward O
that O
God O
would O
give O
him O
. O

Moses O
left O
Egypt O
because O
he O
had O
faith O
. O

He O
was O
not O
afraid O
of O
the O
king O
's O
anger O
. O

He O
continued O
strong O
as O
if O
he O
could O
see O
the O
God O
no O
one O
can O
see O
. O

Moses O
prepared O
the O
Passover O
and O
spread O
the O
blood O
on O
the O
doorways O
of O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
, O
so O
that O
the O
angel O
of O
death O
would O
not O
kill O
their O
firstborn O
sons O
. O

Moses O
did O
this O
because O
he O
had O
faith O
. O

And O
God O
's O
people O
all O
walked O
through O
the O
Red O
Sea O
as O
if O
it O
were O
dry O
land O
. O

They O
were O
able O
to O
do O
this O
because O
they O
had O
faith O
. O

But O
when O
the O
Egyptians O
tried O
to O
follow O
them O
, O
they O
were O
drowned O
. O

And O
the O
walls O
of O
Jericho O
fell O
because O
of O
the O
faith O
of O
God O
's O
people O
. O

They O
marched O
around O
the O
walls O
for O
seven O
days O
, O
and O
then O
the O
walls O
fell O
. O

And O
Rahab O
, O
the O
prostitute O
, O
welcomed O
the O
Israelite O
spies O
like O
friends O
. O

And O
because O
of O
her O
faith O
, O
she O
was O
not O
killed O
with O
the O
ones O
who O
refused O
to O
obey O
. O

Do O
I O
need O
to O
give O
you O
more O
examples O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
have O
enough O
time O
to O
tell O
you O
about O
Gideon O
, O
Barak O
, O
Samson O
, O
Jephthah O
, O
David O
, O
Samuel O
, O
and O
the O
prophets O
. O

All O
of O
them O
had O
great O
faith O
. O

And O
with O
that O
faith O
they O
defeated O
kingdoms O
. O

They O
did O
what O
was O
right O
, O
and O
God O
helped O
them O
in O
the O
ways O
he O
promised O
. O

With O
their O
faith O
some O
people O
closed O
the O
mouths O
of O
lions O
. O

And O
some O
were O
able O
to O
stop O
blazing O
fires O
. O

Others O
escaped O
from O
being O
killed O
with O
swords O
. O

Some O
who O
were O
weak O
were O
made O
strong O
. O

They O
became O
powerful O
in O
battle O
and O
defeated O
other O
armies O
. O

There O
were O
women O
who O
lost O
loved O
ones O
but O
got O
them O
back O
when O
they O
were O
raised O
from O
death O
. O

Others O
were O
tortured O
but O
refused O
to O
accept O
their O
freedom O
. O

They O
did O
this O
so O
that O
they O
could O
be O
raised O
from O
death O
to O
a O
better O
life O
. O

Some O
were O
laughed O
at O
and O
beaten O
. O

Others O
were O
tied O
up O
and O
put O
in O
prison O
. O

They O
were O
killed O
with O
stones O
. O

They O
were O
cut O
in O
half O
. O

They O
were O
killed O
with O
swords O
. O

The O
only O
clothes O
some O
of O
them O
had O
were O
sheepskins O
or O
goatskins O
. O

They O
were O
poor O
, O
persecuted O
, O
and O
treated O
badly O
by O
others O
. O

The O
world O
was O
not O
good O
enough O
for O
these O
great O
people O
. O

They O
had O
to O
wander O
in O
deserts O
and O
mountains O
, O
living O
in O
caves O
and O
holes O
in O
the O
ground O
. O

God O
was O
pleased O
with O
all O
of O
them O
because O
of O
their O
faith O
. O

But O
not O
one O
of O
them O
received O
God O
's O
great O
promise O
. O

God O
planned O
something O
better O
for O
us O
. O

He O
wanted O
to O
make O
us O
perfect O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
he O
wanted O
those O
great O
people O
to O
be O
made O
perfect O
too O
, O
but O
not O
before O
we O
could O
all O
enjoy O
that O
blessing O
together O
. O

So O
we O
must O
be O
more O
careful O
to O
follow O
what O
we O
were O
taught O
. O

We O
must O
be O
careful O
so O
that O
we O
will O
not O
be O
pulled O
away O
from O
the O
true O
way O
. O

The O
teaching O
that O
God O
spoke O
through O
angels O
was O
shown O
to O
be O
true O
. O

And O
every O
time O
his O
people O
did O
something O
against O
that O
teaching O
, O
they O
were O
punished O
for O
what O
they O
did O
. O

They O
were O
punished O
when O
they O
did O
not O
obey O
that O
teaching O
. O

So O
surely O
we O
also O
will O
be O
punished O
if O
we O
do O
n't O
pay O
attention O
to O
the O
salvation O
we O
have O
that O
is O
so O
great O
. O

It O
was O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
who O
first O
told O
people O
about O
it O
. O

And O
those O
who O
heard O
him O
proved O
to O
us O
that O
it O
is O
true O
. O

God O
also O
proved O
it O
by O
using O
miraculous O
signs O
, O
wonders O
, O
and O
all O
kinds O
of O
miracles O
. O

And O
he O
proved O
it O
by O
giving O
people O
various O
gifts O
through O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
in O
just O
the O
way O
he O
wanted O
. O

God O
did O
not O
choose O
angels O
to O
be O
the O
rulers O
over O
the O
new O
world O
that O
was O
coming O
. O

That O
future O
world O
is O
the O
world O
we O
have O
been O
talking O
about O
. O

It O
is O
written O
some O
place O
in O
the O
Scriptures O
, O
`` O
Why O
are O
people O
so O
important O
to O
you O
? O

Why O
do O
you O
even O
think O
about O
them O
? O

Why O
do O
you O
care O
about O
the O
son O
of O
man O
? O

Is O
he O
so O
important O
? O

For O
a O
short O
time O
you O
made O
him O
lower O
than O
the O
angels O
. O

You O
crowned O
him O
with O
glory O
and O
honor O
. O

You O
put O
everything O
under O
his O
control O
. O
'' O

If O
God O
put O
everything O
under O
his O
control O
, O
then O
there O
was O
nothing O
left O
that O
he O
did O
not O
rule O
. O

But O
we O
do O
n't O
yet O
see O
him O
ruling O
over O
everything O
. O

For O
a O
short O
time O
Jesus O
was O
made O
lower O
than O
the O
angels O
, O
but O
now O
we O
see O
him O
wearing O
a O
crown O
of O
glory O
and O
honor O
because O
he O
suffered O
and O
died O
. O

Because O
of O
God O
's O
grace O
, O
Jesus O
died O
for O
everyone O
. O

God O
-- O
the O
one O
who O
made O
all O
things O
and O
for O
whose O
glory O
all O
things O
exist O
-- O
wanted O
many O
people O
to O
be O
his O
children O
and O
share O
his O
glory O
. O

So O
he O
did O
what O
he O
needed O
to O
do O
. O

He O
made O
perfect O
the O
one O
who O
leads O
those O
people O
to O
salvation O
. O

He O
made O
Jesus O
a O
perfect O
Savior O
through O
his O
suffering O
. O

Jesus O
, O
the O
one O
who O
makes O
people O
holy O
, O
and O
those O
who O
are O
made O
holy O
are O
from O
the O
same O
family O
. O

So O
he O
is O
not O
ashamed O
to O
call O
them O
his O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
. O

He O
says O
, O
`` O
God O
, O
I O
will O
tell O
my O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
about O
you O
. O

Before O
all O
your O
people O
I O
will O
sing O
your O
praises O
. O
'' O

He O
also O
says O
, O
`` O
I O
will O
trust O
in O
God O
. O
'' O

And O
he O
says O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
here O
, O
and O
with O
me O
are O
the O
children O
God O
has O
given O
me O
. O
'' O

These O
children O
are O
people O
with O
physical O
bodies O
. O

So O
Jesus O
himself O
became O
like O
them O
and O
had O
the O
same O
experiences O
they O
have O
. O

Jesus O
did O
this O
so O
that O
, O
by O
dying O
, O
he O
could O
destroy O
the O
one O
who O
has O
the O
power O
of O
death O
-- O
the O
devil O
. O

Jesus O
became O
like O
these O
people O
and O
died O
so O
that O
he O
could O
free O
them O
. O

They O
were O
like O
slaves O
all O
their O
lives O
because O
of O
their O
fear O
of O
death O
. O

Clearly O
, O
it O
is O
not O
angels O
that O
Jesus O
helps O
. O

He O
helps O
the O
people O
who O
are O
from O
Abraham O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
Jesus O
had O
to O
be O
made O
like O
us O
, O
his O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
in O
every O
way O
. O

He O
became O
like O
people O
so O
that O
he O
could O
be O
their O
merciful O
and O
faithful O
high O
priest O
in O
service O
to O
God O
. O

Then O
he O
could O
bring O
forgiveness O
for O
the O
people O
's O
sins O
. O

And O
now O
he O
can O
help O
those O
who O
are O
tempted O
. O

He O
is O
able O
to O
help O
because O
he O
himself O
suffered O
and O
was O
tempted O
. O

We O
have O
all O
these O
great O
people O
around O
us O
as O
examples O
. O

Their O
lives O
tell O
us O
what O
faith O
means O
. O

So O
we O
, O
too O
, O
should O
run O
the O
race O
that O
is O
before O
us O
and O
never O
quit O
. O

We O
should O
remove O
from O
our O
lives O
anything O
that O
would O
slow O
us O
down O
and O
the O
sin O
that O
so O
often O
makes O
us O
fall O
. O

We O
must O
never O
stop O
looking O
to O
Jesus O
. O

He O
is O
the O
leader O
of O
our O
faith O
, O
and O
he O
is O
the O
one O
who O
makes O
our O
faith O
complete O
. O

He O
suffered O
death O
on O
a O
cross O
. O

But O
he O
accepted O
the O
shame O
of O
the O
cross O
as O
if O
it O
were O
nothing O
because O
of O
the O
joy O
he O
could O
see O
waiting O
for O
him O
. O

And O
now O
he O
is O
sitting O
at O
the O
right O
side O
of O
God O
's O
throne O
. O

Think O
about O
Jesus O
. O

He O
patiently O
endured O
the O
angry O
insults O
that O
sinful O
people O
were O
shouting O
at O
him O
. O

Think O
about O
him O
so O
that O
you O
wo O
n't O
get O
discouraged O
and O
stop O
trying O
. O

You O
are O
struggling O
against O
sin O
, O
but O
you O
have O
not O
had O
to O
give O
up O
your O
life O
for O
the O
cause O
. O

You O
are O
children O
of O
God O
, O
and O
he O
speaks O
words O
of O
comfort O
to O
you O
. O

You O
have O
forgotten O
these O
words O
: O
`` O
My O
child O
, O
do O
n't O
think O
the O
Lord O
's O
discipline O
is O
worth O
nothing O
, O
and O
do O
n't O
stop O
trying O
when O
he O
corrects O
you O
. O

The O
Lord O
disciplines O
everyone O
he O
loves O
; O
and O
he O
punishes O
everyone O
he O
accepts O
as O
a O
child O
. O
'' O

So O
accept O
sufferings O
like O
a O
father O
's O
discipline O
. O

God O
does O
these O
things O
to O
you O
like O
a O
father O
correcting O
his O
children O
. O

You O
know O
that O
all O
children O
are O
disciplined O
by O
their O
fathers O
. O

So O
, O
if O
you O
never O
receive O
the O
discipline O
that O
every O
child O
must O
have O
, O
you O
are O
not O
true O
children O
and O
do O
n't O
really O
belong O
to O
God O
. O

We O
have O
all O
had O
fathers O
here O
on O
earth O
who O
corrected O
us O
with O
discipline O
. O

And O
we O
respected O
them O
. O

So O
it O
is O
even O
more O
important O
that O
we O
accept O
discipline O
from O
the O
Father O
of O
our O
spirits O
. O

If O
we O
do O
this O
, O
we O
will O
have O
life O
. O

Our O
fathers O
on O
earth O
disciplined O
us O
for O
a O
short O
time O
in O
the O
way O
they O
thought O
was O
best O
. O

But O
God O
disciplines O
us O
to O
help O
us O
so O
that O
we O
can O
be O
holy O
like O
him O
. O

We O
do O
n't O
enjoy O
discipline O
when O
we O
get O
it O
. O

It O
is O
painful O
. O

But O
later O
, O
after O
we O
have O
learned O
our O
lesson O
from O
it O
, O
we O
will O
enjoy O
the O
peace O
that O
comes O
from O
doing O
what O
is O
right O
. O

You O
have O
become O
weak O
, O
so O
make O
yourselves O
strong O
again O
. O

Live O
in O
the O
right O
way O
so O
that O
you O
will O
be O
saved O
and O
your O
weakness O
will O
not O
cause O
you O
to O
be O
lost O
. O

Try O
to O
live O
in O
peace O
with O
everyone O
. O

And O
try O
to O
keep O
your O
lives O
free O
from O
sin O
. O

Anyone O
whose O
life O
is O
not O
holy O
will O
never O
see O
the O
Lord O
. O

Be O
careful O
that O
no O
one O
fails O
to O
get O
God O
's O
grace O
. O

Be O
careful O
that O
no O
one O
loses O
their O
faith O
and O
becomes O
like O
a O
bitter O
weed O
growing O
among O
you O
. O

Someone O
like O
that O
can O
ruin O
your O
whole O
group O
. O

Be O
careful O
that O
no O
one O
commits O
sexual O
sin O
. O

And O
be O
careful O
that O
no O
one O
is O
like O
Esau O
and O
never O
thinks O
about O
God O
. O

As O
the O
oldest O
son O
, O
Esau O
would O
have O
inherited O
everything O
from O
his O
father O
. O

But O
he O
sold O
all O
that O
for O
a O
single O
meal O
. O

You O
remember O
that O
after O
Esau O
did O
this O
, O
he O
wanted O
to O
get O
his O
father O
's O
blessing O
. O

He O
wanted O
that O
blessing O
so O
much O
that O
he O
cried O
. O

But O
his O
father O
refused O
to O
give O
him O
the O
blessing O
, O
because O
Esau O
could O
find O
no O
way O
to O
change O
what O
he O
had O
done O
. O

You O
have O
not O
come O
to O
a O
place O
that O
can O
be O
seen O
and O
touched O
, O
like O
the O
mountain O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
saw O
, O
which O
was O
burning O
with O
fire O
and O
covered O
with O
darkness O
, O
gloom O
, O
and O
storms O
. O

There O
is O
no O
sound O
of O
a O
trumpet O
or O
a O
voice O
speaking O
words O
like O
those O
they O
heard O
. O

When O
they O
heard O
the O
voice O
, O
they O
begged O
never O
to O
hear O
another O
word O
. O

They O
did O
not O
want O
to O
hear O
the O
command O
: O
`` O
If O
anything O
, O
even O
an O
animal O
, O
touches O
the O
mountain O
, O
it O
must O
be O
killed O
with O
stones O
. O
'' O

What O
they O
saw O
was O
so O
terrible O
that O
Moses O
said O
, O
`` O

I O
am O
shaking O
with O
fear O
. O
'' O

But O
you O
have O
come O
to O
Mount O
Zion O
, O
to O
the O
city O
of O
the O
living O
God O
, O
the O
heavenly O
Jerusalem O
. O

You O
have O
come O
to O
a O
place O
where O
thousands O
of O
angels O
have O
gathered O
to O
celebrate O
. O

You O
have O
come O
to O
the O
meeting O
of O
God O
's O
firstborn O
children O
. O

Their O
names O
are O
written O
in O
heaven O
. O

You O
have O
come O
to O
God O
, O
the O
judge O
of O
all O
people O
. O

And O
you O
have O
come O
to O
the O
spirits O
of O
good O
people O
who O
have O
been O
made O
perfect O
. O

You O
have O
come O
to O
Jesus O
-- O
the O
one O
who O
brought O
the O
new O
agreement O
from O
God O
to O
his O
people O
. O

You O
have O
come O
to O
the O
sprinkled O
blood O
that O
tells O
us O
about O
better O
things O
than O
the O
blood O
of O
Abel O
. O

Be O
careful O
and O
do O
n't O
refuse O
to O
listen O
when O
God O
speaks O
. O

Those O
people O
refused O
to O
listen O
to O
him O
when O
he O
warned O
them O
on O
earth O
. O

And O
they O
did O
not O
escape O
. O

Now O
God O
is O
speaking O
from O
heaven O
. O

So O
now O
it O
will O
be O
worse O
for O
those O
who O
refuse O
to O
listen O
to O
him O
. O

When O
he O
spoke O
before O
, O
his O
voice O
shook O
the O
earth O
. O

But O
now O
he O
has O
promised O
, O
`` O
Once O
again O
I O
will O
shake O
the O
earth O
, O
but O
I O
will O
also O
shake O
heaven O
. O
'' O

The O
words O
`` O
once O
again O
'' O
clearly O
show O
us O
that O
everything O
that O
was O
created O
will O
be O
destroyed O
-- O
that O
is O
, O
the O
things O
that O
can O
be O
shaken O
. O

And O
only O
what O
can O
not O
be O
shaken O
will O
remain O
. O

So O
we O
should O
be O
thankful O
because O
we O
have O
a O
kingdom O
that O
can O
not O
be O
shaken O
. O

And O
because O
we O
are O
thankful O
, O
we O
should O
worship O
God O
in O
a O
way O
that O
will O
please O
him O
. O

We O
should O
do O
this O
with O
respect O
and O
fear O
, O
because O
our O
God O
is O
like O
a O
fire O
that O
can O
destroy O
us O
. O

Continue O
loving O
each O
other O
as O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
in O
Christ O
. O

Always O
remember O
to O
help O
people O
by O
welcoming O
them O
into O
your O
home O
. O

Some O
people O
have O
done O
that O
and O
have O
helped O
angels O
without O
knowing O
it O
. O

Do O
n't O
forget O
those O
who O
are O
in O
prison O
. O

Remember O
them O
as O
though O
you O
were O
in O
prison O
with O
them O
. O

And O
do O
n't O
forget O
those O
who O
are O
suffering O
. O

Remember O
them O
as O
though O
you O
were O
suffering O
with O
them O
. O

Marriage O
should O
be O
honored O
by O
everyone O
. O

And O
every O
marriage O
should O
be O
kept O
pure O
between O
husband O
and O
wife O
. O

God O
will O
judge O
guilty O
those O
who O
commit O
sexual O
sins O
and O
adultery O
. O

Keep O
your O
lives O
free O
from O
the O
love O
of O
money O
. O

And O
be O
satisfied O
with O
what O
you O
have O
. O

God O
has O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
will O
never O
leave O
you O
; O
I O
will O
never O
run O
away O
from O
you O
. O
'' O

So O
we O
can O
feel O
sure O
and O
say O
, O
`` O
The O
Lord O
is O
my O
helper O
; O
I O
will O
not O
be O
afraid O
. O

People O
can O
do O
nothing O
to O
me O
. O
'' O

Remember O
your O
leaders O
. O

They O
taught O
God O
's O
message O
to O
you O
. O

Remember O
how O
they O
lived O
and O
died O
, O
and O
copy O
their O
faith O
. O

Jesus O
Christ O
is O
the O
same O
yesterday O
, O
today O
, O
and O
forever O
. O

Do O
n't O
let O
all O
kinds O
of O
strange O
teachings O
lead O
you O
into O
the O
wrong O
way O
. O

Depend O
only O
on O
God O
's O
grace O
for O
spiritual O
strength O
, O
not O
on O
rules O
about O
foods O
. O

Obeying O
those O
rules O
does O
n't O
help O
anyone O
. O

We O
have O
a O
sacrifice O
. O

And O
those O
priests O
who O
serve O
in O
the O
Holy O
Tent O
can O
not O
eat O
from O
the O
sacrifice O
we O
have O
. O

The O
high O
priest O
carries O
the O
blood O
of O
animals O
into O
the O
Most O
Holy O
Place O
and O
offers O
that O
blood O
for O
sins O
. O

But O
the O
bodies O
of O
those O
animals O
are O
burned O
outside O
the O
camp O
. O

So O
Jesus O
also O
suffered O
outside O
the O
city O
. O

He O
died O
to O
make O
his O
people O
holy O
with O
his O
own O
blood O
. O

So O
we O
should O
go O
to O
Jesus O
outside O
the O
camp O
and O
accept O
the O
same O
shame O
that O
he O
had O
. O

Here O
on O
earth O
we O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
city O
that O
lasts O
forever O
. O

But O
we O
are O
waiting O
for O
the O
city O
that O
we O
will O
have O
in O
the O
future O
. O

So O
through O
Jesus O
we O
should O
never O
stop O
offering O
our O
sacrifice O
to O
God O
. O

That O
sacrifice O
is O
our O
praise O
, O
coming O
from O
lips O
that O
speak O
his O
name O
. O

And O
do O
n't O
forget O
to O
do O
good O
and O
to O
share O
what O
you O
have O
with O
others O
, O
because O
sacrifices O
like O
these O
are O
very O
pleasing O
to O
God O
. O

Obey O
your O
leaders O
. O

Be O
willing O
to O
do O
what O
they O
say O
. O

They O
are O
responsible O
for O
your O
spiritual O
welfare O
, O
so O
they O
are O
always O
watching O
to O
protect O
you O
. O

Obey O
them O
so O
that O
their O
work O
will O
give O
them O
joy O
, O
not O
grief O
. O

It O
wo O
n't O
help O
you O
to O
make O
it O
hard O
for O
them O
. O

Continue O
praying O
for O
us O
. O

We O
feel O
right O
about O
what O
we O
do O
, O
because O
we O
always O
try O
to O
do O
what O
is O
best O
. O

And O
I O
beg O
you O
to O
pray O
that O
God O
will O
send O
me O
back O
to O
you O
soon O
. O

I O
want O
this O
more O
than O
anything O
else O
. O

I O
pray O
that O
the O
God O
of O
peace O
will O
give O
you O
every O
good O
thing O
you O
need O
so O
that O
you O
can O
do O
what O
he O
wants O
. O

God O
is O
the O
one O
who O
raised O
from O
death O
our O
Lord O
Jesus O
, O
the O
Great O
Shepherd O
of O
his O
sheep O
. O

He O
raised O
him O
because O
Jesus O
sacrificed O
his O
blood O
to O
begin O
the O
new O
agreement O
that O
never O
ends O
. O

I O
pray O
that O
God O
will O
work O
through O
Jesus O
Christ O
to O
do O
the O
things O
in O
us O
that O
please O
him O
. O

To O
him O
be O
glory O
forever O
. O

Amen O
. O

My O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
I O
beg O
you O
to O
listen O
patiently O
to O
what O
I O
have O
said O
. O

I O
wrote O
this O
letter O
to O
strengthen O
you O
. O

And O
it O
is O
not O
very O
long O
. O

I O
want O
you O
to O
know O
that O
our O
brother O
Timothy O
is O
out O
of O
prison O
. O

If O
he O
comes O
to O
me O
soon O
, O
we O
will O
both O
come O
to O
see O
you O
. O

Give O
my O
greetings O
to O
all O
your O
leaders O
and O
to O
all O
God O
's O
people O
. O

All O
those O
from O
Italy O
send O
you O
their O
greetings O
. O

God O
's O
grace O
be O
with O
you O
all O
. O

And O
we O
still O
have O
the O
promise O
that O
God O
gave O
those O
people O
. O

That O
promise O
is O
that O
we O
can O
enter O
his O
place O
of O
rest O
. O

So O
we O
should O
be O
very O
careful O
that O
none O
of O
you O
fails O
to O
get O
that O
promise O
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
good O
news O
about O
it O
was O
told O
to O
us O
just O
as O
it O
was O
to O
them O
. O

But O
the O
message O
they O
heard O
did O
not O
help O
them O
. O

They O
heard O
it O
but O
did O
not O
accept O
it O
with O
faith O
. O

Only O
we O
who O
believe O
it O
are O
able O
to O
enter O
God O
's O
place O
of O
rest O
. O

As O
God O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
was O
angry O
and O
made O
a O
promise O
: O
' O
They O
will O
never O
enter O
my O
place O
of O
rest O
. O
' O
'' O

But O
God O
's O
work O
was O
finished O
from O
the O
time O
he O
made O
the O
world O
. O

Yes O
, O
somewhere O
in O
the O
Scriptures O
he O
talked O
about O
the O
seventh O
day O
of O
the O
week O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
So O
on O
the O
seventh O
day O
God O
rested O
from O
all O
his O
work O
. O
'' O

But O
in O
the O
Scripture O
above O
God O
said O
, O
`` O
They O
will O
never O
enter O
my O
place O
of O
rest O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
opportunity O
is O
still O
there O
for O
some O
to O
enter O
and O
enjoy O
God O
's O
rest O
. O

But O
those O
who O
first O
heard O
the O
good O
news O
about O
it O
did O
not O
enter O
, O
because O
they O
did O
not O
obey O
. O

So O
God O
planned O
another O
special O
day O
. O

It O
is O
called O
`` O
today O
. O
'' O

He O
spoke O
about O
that O
day O
through O
David O
a O
long O
time O
later O
using O
the O
words O
we O
quoted O
before O
: O
`` O
If O
you O
hear O
God O
's O
voice O
today O
, O
do O
n't O
be O
stubborn O
. O
'' O

We O
know O
that O
Joshua O
did O
not O
lead O
the O
people O
into O
the O
place O
of O
rest O
that O
God O
promised O
. O

We O
know O
this O
because O
God O
spoke O
later O
about O
another O
day O
for O
rest O
. O

This O
shows O
that O
the O
seventh O
- O
day O
rest O
for O
God O
's O
people O
is O
still O
to O
come O
. O

God O
rested O
after O
he O
finished O
his O
work O
. O

So O
everyone O
who O
enters O
God O
's O
place O
of O
rest O
will O
also O
have O
rest O
from O
their O
own O
work O
just O
as O
God O
did O
. O

So O
let O
us O
try O
as O
hard O
as O
we O
can O
to O
enter O
God O
's O
place O
of O
rest O
. O

We O
must O
try O
hard O
so O
that O
none O
of O
us O
will O
be O
lost O
by O
following O
the O
example O
of O
those O
who O
refused O
to O
obey O
God O
. O

God O
's O
word O
is O
alive O
and O
working O
. O

It O
is O
sharper O
than O
the O
sharpest O
sword O
and O
cuts O
all O
the O
way O
into O
us O
. O

It O
cuts O
deep O
to O
the O
place O
where O
the O
soul O
and O
the O
spirit O
are O
joined O
. O

God O
's O
word O
cuts O
to O
the O
center O
of O
our O
joints O
and O
our O
bones O
. O

It O
judges O
the O
thoughts O
and O
feelings O
in O
our O
hearts O
. O

Nothing O
in O
all O
the O
world O
can O
be O
hidden O
from O
God O
. O

He O
can O
clearly O
see O
all O
things O
. O

Everything O
is O
open O
before O
him O
. O

And O
to O
him O
we O
must O
explain O
the O
way O
we O
have O
lived O
. O

We O
have O
a O
great O
high O
priest O
who O
has O
gone O
to O
live O
with O
God O
in O
heaven O
. O

He O
is O
Jesus O
the O
Son O
of O
God O
. O

So O
let O
us O
continue O
to O
express O
our O
faith O
in O
him O
. O

Jesus O
, O
our O
high O
priest O
, O
is O
able O
to O
understand O
our O
weaknesses O
. O

When O
Jesus O
lived O
on O
earth O
, O
he O
was O
tempted O
in O
every O
way O
. O

He O
was O
tempted O
in O
the O
same O
ways O
we O
are O
tempted O
, O
but O
he O
never O
sinned O
. O

With O
Jesus O
as O
our O
high O
priest O
, O
we O
can O
feel O
free O
to O
come O
before O
God O
's O
throne O
where O
there O
is O
grace O
. O

There O
we O
receive O
mercy O
and O
kindness O
to O
help O
us O
when O
we O
need O
it O
. O

In O
the O
past O
God O
spoke O
to O
our O
people O
through O
the O
prophets O
. O

He O
spoke O
to O
them O
many O
times O
and O
in O
many O
different O
ways O
. O

And O
now O
in O
these O
last O
days O
, O
God O
has O
spoken O
to O
us O
again O
through O
his O
Son O
. O

He O
made O
the O
whole O
world O
through O
his O
Son O
. O

And O
he O
has O
chosen O
his O
Son O
to O
have O
all O
things O
. O

The O
Son O
shows O
the O
glory O
of O
God O
. O

He O
is O
a O
perfect O
copy O
of O
God O
's O
nature O
, O
and O
he O
holds O
everything O
together O
by O
his O
powerful O
command O
. O

The O
Son O
made O
people O
clean O
from O
their O
sins O
. O

Then O
he O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
right O
side O
of O
God O
, O
the O
Great O
One O
in O
heaven O
. O

The O
Son O
became O
much O
greater O
than O
the O
angels O
, O
and O
God O
gave O
him O
a O
name O
that O
is O
much O
greater O
than O
any O
of O
their O
names O
. O

God O
never O
said O
this O
to O
any O
of O
the O
angels O
: O
`` O
You O
are O
my O
Son O
. O

Today O
I O
have O
become O
your O
Father O
. O
'' O

God O
also O
never O
said O
about O
an O
angel O
, O
`` O
I O
will O
be O
his O
Father O
, O
and O
he O
will O
be O
my O
son O
. O
'' O

And O
then O
, O
when O
God O
sent O
his O
firstborn O
Son O
into O
the O
world O
, O
he O
said O
, O
`` O
Let O
all O
God O
's O
angels O
worship O
the O
Son O
. O
'' O

This O
is O
what O
God O
said O
about O
the O
angels O
: O
`` O
He O
changes O
his O
angels O
into O
winds O
and O
his O
servants O
into O
flaming O
fire O
. O
'' O

But O
this O
is O
what O
he O
said O
about O
his O
Son O
: O
`` O
God O
your O
kingdom O
will O
last O
forever O
and O
ever O
. O

You O
use O
your O
authority O
for O
justice O
. O

You O
love O
what O
is O
right O
and O
hate O
what O
is O
wrong O
. O

So O
God O
, O
your O
God O
, O
has O
chosen O
you O
, O
giving O
you O
more O
honor O
and O
joy O
than O
anyone O
like O
you O
. O
'' O

God O
also O
said O
, O
`` O
O O
Lord O
, O
in O
the O
beginning O
you O
made O
the O
earth O
, O
and O
your O
hands O
made O
the O
sky O
. O

These O
things O
will O
disappear O
, O
but O
you O
will O
stay O
. O

They O
will O
all O
wear O
out O
like O
old O
clothes O
. O

You O
will O
fold O
them O
up O
like O
a O
coat O
, O
and O
they O
will O
be O
changed O
like O
clothes O
. O

But O
you O
never O
change O
, O
and O
your O
life O
will O
never O
end O
. O
'' O

And O
God O
never O
said O
this O
to O
an O
angel O
: O
`` O
Sit O
at O
my O
right O
side O
until O
I O
put O
your O
enemies O
under O
your O
power O
. O
'' O

All O
the O
angels O
are O
spirits O
who O
serve O
God O
and O
are O
sent O
to O
help O
those O
who O
will O
receive O
salvation O
. O

Every O
Jewish O
high O
priest O
is O
chosen O
from O
among O
men O
. O

That O
priest O
is O
given O
the O
work O
of O
helping O
people O
with O
the O
things O
they O
must O
do O
for O
God O
. O

He O
must O
offer O
to O
God O
gifts O
and O
sacrifices O
for O
sins O
. O

The O
high O
priest O
has O
his O
own O
weaknesses O
. O

So O
he O
is O
able O
to O
be O
gentle O
with O
those O
who O
do O
wrong O
out O
of O
ignorance O
. O

He O
offers O
sacrifices O
for O
their O
sins O
, O
but O
he O
must O
also O
offer O
sacrifices O
for O
his O
own O
sins O
. O

To O
be O
a O
high O
priest O
is O
an O
honor O
. O

But O
no O
one O
chooses O
himself O
for O
this O
work O
. O

That O
person O
must O
be O
chosen O
by O
God O
just O
as O
Aaron O
was O
. O

It O
is O
the O
same O
with O
Christ O
. O

He O
did O
not O
choose O
himself O
to O
have O
the O
honor O
of O
becoming O
a O
high O
priest O
. O

But O
God O
chose O
him O
. O

God O
said O
to O
Christ O
, O
`` O
You O
are O
my O
Son O
. O

Today O
I O
have O
become O
your O
Father O
. O
'' O

And O
in O
another O
part O
of O
the O
Scriptures O
God O
says O
, O
`` O

You O
are O
a O
priest O
forever O
-- O
the O
kind O
of O
priest O
Melchizedek O
was O
. O
'' O

While O
Christ O
lived O
on O
earth O
he O
prayed O
to O
God O
, O
asking O
for O
help O
from O
the O
one O
who O
could O
save O
him O
from O
death O
. O

He O
prayed O
to O
God O
with O
loud O
cries O
and O
tears O
. O

And O
his O
prayers O
were O
answered O
because O
of O
his O
great O
respect O
for O
God O
. O

Jesus O
was O
the O
Son O
of O
God O
, O
but O
he O
still O
suffered O
, O
and O
through O
his O
sufferings O
he O
learned O
to O
obey O
whatever O
God O
says O
. O

This O
made O
him O
the O
perfect O
high O
priest O
, O
who O
provides O
the O
way O
for O
everyone O
who O
obeys O
him O
to O
be O
saved O
forever O
. O

God O
made O
him O
high O
priest O
, O
just O
like O
Melchizedek O
. O

We O
have O
many O
things O
to O
tell O
you O
about O
this O
. O

But O
it O
is O
hard O
to O
explain O
because O
you O
have O
stopped O
trying O
to O
understand O
. O

You O
have O
had O
enough O
time O
that O
by O
now O
you O
should O
be O
teachers O
. O

But O
you O
need O
someone O
to O
teach O
you O
again O
the O
first O
lessons O
of O
God O
's O
teaching O
. O

You O
still O
need O
the O
teaching O
that O
is O
like O
milk O
. O

You O
are O
not O
ready O
for O
solid O
food O
. O

Anyone O
who O
lives O
on O
milk O
is O
still O
a O
baby O
and O
is O
not O
able O
to O
understand O
much O
about O
living O
right O
. O

But O
solid O
food O
is O
for O
people O
who O
have O
grown O
up O
. O
> O

From O
their O
experience O
they O
have O
learned O
to O
see O
the O
difference O
between O
good O
and O
evil O
. O

Here O
is O
the O
point O
of O
what O
we O
are O
saying O
: O
We O
have O
a O
high O
priest O
like O
that O
, O
who O
sits O
on O
the O
right O
side O
of O
God O
's O
throne O
in O
heaven O
. O

Our O
high O
priest O
serves O
in O
the O
Most O
Holy O
Place O
. O

He O
serves O
in O
the O
true O
place O
of O
worship O
that O
was O
made O
by O
God O
, O
not O
by O
anyone O
here O
on O
earth O
. O

Every O
high O
priest O
has O
the O
work O
of O
offering O
gifts O
and O
sacrifices O
to O
God O
. O

So O
our O
high O
priest O
must O
also O
offer O
something O
to O
God O
. O

If O
our O
high O
priest O
were O
now O
living O
on O
earth O
, O
he O
would O
not O
be O
a O
priest O
. O

I O
say O
this O
because O
there O
are O
already O
priests O
here O
who O
follow O
the O
law O
by O
offering O
gifts O
to O
God O
. O

The O
work O
that O
these O
priests O
do O
is O
really O
only O
a O
copy O
and O
a O
shadow O
of O
what O
is O
in O
heaven O
. O

That O
is O
why O
God O
warned O
Moses O
when O
he O
was O
ready O
to O
build O
the O
Holy O
Tent O
: O
`` O
Be O
sure O
to O
make O
everything O
exactly O
like O
the O
pattern O
I O
showed O
you O
on O
the O
mountain O
. O
'' O

But O
the O
work O
that O
has O
been O
given O
to O
Jesus O
is O
much O
greater O
than O
the O
work O
that O
was O
given O
to O
those O
priests O
. O

In O
the O
same O
way O
, O
the O
new O
agreement O
that O
Jesus O
brought O
from O
God O
to O
his O
people O
is O
much O
greater O
than O
the O
old O
one O
. O

And O
the O
new O
agreement O
is O
based O
on O
better O
promises O
. O

If O
there O
was O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
the O
first O
agreement O
, O
then O
there O
would O
be O
no O
need O
for O
a O
second O
agreement O
. O

But O
God O
found O
something O
wrong O
with O
the O
people O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
time O
is O
coming O
, O
says O
the O
Lord O
, O
when O
I O
will O
give O
a O
new O
agreement O
to O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
and O
to O
the O
people O
of O
Judah O
. O

It O
will O
not O
be O
like O
the O
agreement O
that O
I O
gave O
to O
their O
fathers O
. O

That O
is O
the O
agreement O
I O
gave O
when O
I O
took O
them O
by O
the O
hand O
and O
led O
them O
out O
of O
Egypt O
. O

They O
did O
not O
continue O
following O
the O
agreement O
I O
gave O
them O
, O
and O
I O
turned O
away O
from O
them O
, O
says O
the O
Lord O
. O

This O
is O
the O
new O
agreement O
I O
will O
give O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
. O

I O
will O
give O
this O
agreement O
in O
the O
future O
, O
says O
the O
Lord O
: O
I O
will O
put O
my O
laws O
in O
their O
minds O
, O
and O
I O
will O
write O
my O
laws O
on O
their O
hearts O
. O

I O
will O
be O
their O
God O
, O
and O
they O
will O
be O
my O
people O
. O

Never O
again O
will O
anyone O
have O
to O
teach O
their O
neighbors O
or O
their O
family O
to O
know O
the O
Lord O
. O

All O
people O
-- O
the O
greatest O
and O
the O
least O
important O
-- O
will O
know O
me O
. O

And O
I O
will O
forgive O
the O
wrongs O
they O
have O
done O
, O
and O
I O
will O
not O
remember O
their O
sins O
. O
'' O

God O
called O
this O
a O
new O
agreement O
, O
so O
he O
has O
made O
the O
first O
agreement O
old O
. O

And O
anything O
that O
is O
old O
and O
useless O
is O
ready O
to O
disappear O
. O

Melchizedek O
was O
the O
king O
of O
Salem O
and O
a O
priest O
for O
God O
the O
Most O
High O
. O

He O
met O
Abraham O
when O
Abraham O
was O
coming O
back O
after O
defeating O
the O
kings O
. O

That O
day O
Melchizedek O
blessed O
him O
. O

Then O
Abraham O
gave O
him O
a O
tenth O
of O
everything O
he O
had O
. O

The O
name O
Melchizedek O
, O
king O
of O
Salem O
, O
has O
two O
meanings O
. O

First O
, O
Melchizedek O
means O
`` O
king O
of O
justice O
. O
'' O

And O
`` O
king O
of O
Salem O
'' O
means O
`` O
king O
of O
peace O
. O
'' O

No O
one O
knows O
who O
his O
father O
or O
mother O
was O
or O
where O
he O
came O
from O
. O

And O
no O
one O
knows O
when O
he O
was O
born O
or O
when O
he O
died O
. O

Melchizedek O
is O
like O
the O
Son O
of O
God O
in O
that O
he O
will O
always O
be O
a O
priest O
. O

You O
can O
see O
that O
Melchizedek O
was O
very O
great O
. O

Abraham O
, O
our O
great O
ancestor O
, O
gave O
him O
a O
tenth O
of O
everything O
he O
won O
in O
battle O
. O

Now O
the O
law O
says O
that O
those O
from O
the O
tribe O
of O
Levi O
who O
become O
priests O
must O
get O
a O
tenth O
from O
their O
own O
people O
, O
even O
though O
they O
and O
their O
people O
are O
both O
from O
the O
family O
of O
Abraham O
. O

Melchizedek O
was O
not O
even O
from O
the O
tribe O
of O
Levi O
, O
but O
Abraham O
gave O
him O
a O
tenth O
of O
what O
he O
had O
. O

And O
Melchizedek O
blessed O
Abraham O
-- O
the O
one O
who O
had O
God O
's O
promises O
. O

And O
everyone O
knows O
that O
the O
more O
important O
person O
always O
blesses O
the O
less O
important O
person O
. O

Those O
priests O
get O
a O
tenth O
, O
but O
they O
are O
only O
men O
who O
live O
and O
then O
die O
. O

But O
Melchizedek O
, O
who O
got O
a O
tenth O
from O
Abraham O
, O
continues O
to O
live O
, O
as O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
. O

Now O
those O
from O
the O
family O
of O
Levi O
are O
the O
ones O
who O
get O
a O
tenth O
from O
the O
people O
. O

But O
we O
can O
say O
that O
when O
Abraham O
paid O
Melchizedek O
a O
tenth O
, O
then O
Levi O
also O
paid O
it O
. O

Levi O
was O
not O
yet O
born O
, O
but O
he O
already O
existed O
in O
his O
ancestor O
Abraham O
when O
Melchizedek O
met O
him O
. O

The O
people O
were O
given O
the O
law O
under O
the O
system O
of O
priests O
from O
the O
tribe O
of O
Levi O
. O

But O
no O
one O
could O
be O
made O
spiritually O
perfect O
through O
that O
system O
of O
priests O
. O

So O
there O
was O
a O
need O
for O
another O
priest O
to O
come O
. O

I O
mean O
a O
priest O
like O
Melchizedek O
, O
not O
Aaron O
. O

And O
when O
a O
different O
kind O
of O
priest O
comes O
, O
then O
the O
law O
must O
be O
changed O
too O
. O

We O
are O
talking O
about O
our O
Lord O
Christ O
, O
who O
belonged O
to O
a O
different O
tribe O
. O

No O
one O
from O
that O
tribe O
ever O
served O
as O
a O
priest O
at O
the O
altar O
. O

It O
is O
clear O
that O
Christ O
came O
from O
the O
tribe O
of O
Judah O
. O

And O
Moses O
said O
nothing O
about O
priests O
belonging O
to O
that O
tribe O
. O

And O
these O
things O
become O
even O
clearer O
when O
we O
see O
that O
another O
priest O
has O
come O
who O
is O
like O
Melchizedek O
. O

He O
was O
made O
a O
priest O
, O
but O
not O
because O
he O
met O
the O
requirement O
of O
being O
born O
into O
the O
right O
family O
. O

He O
became O
a O
priest O
by O
the O
power O
of O
a O
life O
that O
will O
never O
end O
. O

This O
is O
what O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
about O
him O
: O
`` O
You O
are O
a O
priest O
forever O
-- O
the O
kind O
of O
priest O
Melchizedek O
was O
. O
'' O

The O
old O
rule O
is O
now O
ended O
because O
it O
was O
weak O
and O
worthless O
. O

The O
Law O
of O
Moses O
could O
not O
make O
anything O
perfect O
. O

But O
now O
a O
better O
hope O
has O
been O
given O
to O
us O
. O

And O
with O
that O
hope O
we O
can O
come O
near O
to O
God O
. O

Also O
, O
it O
is O
important O
that O
God O
made O
a O
promise O
with O
an O
oath O
when O
he O
made O
Jesus O
high O
priest O
. O

When O
those O
other O
men O
became O
priests O
, O
there O
was O
no O
oath O
. O

But O
Christ O
became O
a O
priest O
with O
God O
's O
oath O
. O

God O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
The O
Lord O
has O
made O
a O
promise O
with O
an O
oath O
and O
will O
not O
change O
his O
mind O
: O
' O
You O
are O
a O
priest O
forever O
. O
' O
'' O

So O
this O
means O
that O
Jesus O
is O
the O
guarantee O
of O
a O
better O
agreement O
from O
God O
to O
his O
people O
. O

Also O
, O
when O
one O
of O
those O
other O
priests O
died O
, O
he O
could O
not O
continue O
being O
a O
priest O
. O

So O
there O
were O
many O
of O
those O
priests O
. O

But O
Jesus O
lives O
forever O
. O

He O
will O
never O
stop O
serving O
as O
a O
priest O
. O

So O
Christ O
can O
save O
those O
who O
come O
to O
God O
through O
him O
. O

Christ O
can O
do O
this O
forever O
, O
because O
he O
always O
lives O
and O
is O
ready O
to O
help O
people O
when O
they O
come O
before O
God O
. O

So O
Jesus O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
high O
priest O
we O
need O
. O

He O
is O
holy O
. O

He O
has O
no O
sin O
in O
him O
. O

He O
is O
pure O
and O
not O
influenced O
by O
sinners O
. O

And O
he O
is O
raised O
above O
the O
heavens O
. O

He O
is O
not O
like O
those O
other O
priests O
. O

They O
had O
to O
offer O
sacrifices O
every O
day O
, O
first O
for O
their O
own O
sins O
, O
and O
then O
for O
the O
sins O
of O
the O
people O
. O

But O
Jesus O
does O
n't O
need O
to O
do O
that O
. O

He O
offered O
only O
one O
sacrifice O
for O
all O
time O
. O

He O
offered O
himself O
. O

The O
law O
chooses O
high O
priests O
who O
are O
men O
and O
have O
the O
same O
weaknesses O
that O
all O
people O
have O
. O

But O
after O
the O
law O
, O
God O
spoke O
the O
oath O
that O
made O
his O
Son O
high O
priest O
. O

And O
that O
Son O
, O
made O
perfect O
through O
suffering O
, O
will O
serve O
forever O
. O

Think O
about O
what O
we O
have O
in O
Christ O
: O
the O
encouragement O
he O
has O
brought O
us O
, O
the O
comfort O
of O
his O
love O
, O
our O
sharing O
in O
his O
Spirit O
, O
and O
the O
mercy O
and O
kindness O
he O
has O
shown O
us O
. O

If O
you O
enjoy O
these O
blessings O
, O
then O
do O
what O
will O
make O
my O
joy O
complete O
: O
Agree O
with O
each O
other O
, O
and O
show O
your O
love O
for O
each O
other O
. O

Be O
united O
in O
your O
goals O
and O
in O
the O
way O
you O
think O
. O

In O
whatever O
you O
do O
, O
do O
n't O
let O
selfishness O
or O
pride O
be O
your O
guide O
. O

Be O
humble O
, O
and O
honor O
others O
more O
than O
yourselves O
. O

Do O
n't O
be O
interested O
only O
in O
your O
own O
life O
, O
but O
care O
about O
the O
lives O
of O
others O
too O
. O

In O
your O
life O
together O
, O
think O
the O
way O
Christ O
Jesus O
thought O
. O

He O
was O
like O
God O
in O
every O
way O
, O
but O
he O
did O
not O
think O
that O
his O
being O
equal O
with O
God O
was O
something O
to O
use O
for O
his O
own O
benefit O
. O

Instead O
, O
he O
gave O
up O
everything O
, O
even O
his O
place O
with O
God O
. O

He O
accepted O
the O
role O
of O
a O
servant O
, O
appearing O
in O
human O
form O
. O

During O
his O
life O
as O
a O
man O
, O
he O
humbled O
himself O
by O
being O
fully O
obedient O
to O
God O
, O
even O
when O
that O
caused O
his O
death O
-- O
death O
on O
a O
cross O
. O

So O
God O
raised O
him O
up O
to O
the O
most O
important O
place O
and O
gave O
him O
the O
name O
that O
is O
greater O
than O
any O
other O
name O
. O

God O
did O
this O
so O
that O
every O
person O
will O
bow O
down O
to O
honor O
the O
name O
of O
Jesus O
. O

Everyone O
in O
heaven O
, O
on O
earth O
, O
and O
under O
the O
earth O
will O
bow O
. O

They O
will O
all O
confess O
, O
`` O
Jesus O
Christ O
is O
Lord O
, O
'' O
and O
this O
will O
bring O
glory O
to O
God O
the O
Father O
. O

My O
dear O
friends O
, O
you O
always O
obeyed O
what O
you O
were O
taught O
. O

Just O
as O
you O
obeyed O
when O
I O
was O
with O
you O
, O
it O
is O
even O
more O
important O
for O
you O
to O
obey O
now O
that O
I O
am O
not O
there O
. O

So O
you O
must O
continue O
to O
live O
in O
a O
way O
that O
gives O
meaning O
to O
your O
salvation O
. O

Do O
this O
with O
fear O
and O
respect O
for O
God O
. O

Yes O
, O
it O
is O
God O
who O
is O
working O
in O
you O
. O

He O
helps O
you O
want O
to O
do O
what O
pleases O
him O
, O
and O
he O
gives O
you O
the O
power O
to O
do O
it O
. O

Do O
everything O
without O
complaining O
or O
arguing O
so O
that O
you O
will O
be O
blameless O
and O
pure O
, O
children O
of O
God O
without O
any O
fault O
. O

But O
you O
are O
living O
with O
evil O
people O
all O
around O
you O
, O
who O
have O
lost O
their O
sense O
of O
what O
is O
right O
. O

Among O
those O
people O
you O
shine O
like O
lights O
in O
a O
dark O
world O
, O
and O
you O
offer O
them O
the O
teaching O
that O
gives O
life O
. O

So O
I O
can O
be O
proud O
of O
you O
when O
Christ O
comes O
again O
. O

You O
will O
show O
that O
my O
work O
was O
not O
wasted O
-- O
that O
I O
ran O
in O
the O
race O
and O
won O
. O

Your O
faith O
makes O
you O
give O
your O
lives O
as O
a O
sacrifice O
in O
serving O
God O
. O

Maybe O
I O
will O
have O
to O
offer O
my O
own O
life O
with O
your O
sacrifice O
. O

But O
if O
that O
happens O
, O
I O
will O
be O
glad O
, O
and O
I O
will O
share O
my O
joy O
with O
all O
of O
you O
. O

You O
also O
should O
be O
glad O
and O
share O
your O
joy O
with O
me O
. O

With O
the O
blessing O
of O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
, O
I O
hope O
I O
will O
be O
able O
to O
send O
Timothy O
to O
you O
soon O
. O

I O
will O
be O
glad O
to O
learn O
how O
you O
are O
. O

I O
have O
no O
one O
else O
like O
Timothy O
, O
who O
genuinely O
cares O
for O
you O
. O

Others O
are O
interested O
only O
in O
their O
own O
lives O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
care O
about O
the O
work O
of O
Christ O
Jesus O
. O

You O
know O
the O
kind O
of O
person O
Timothy O
is O
. O

He O
has O
served O
with O
me O
in O
telling O
the O
Good O
News O
like O
a O
son O
with O
his O
father O
. O

I O
plan O
to O
send O
him O
to O
you O
quickly O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
know O
what O
will O
happen O
to O
me O
. O

I O
am O
sure O
the O
Lord O
will O
help O
me O
come O
to O
you O
soon O
. O

For O
now O
, O
I O
think O
I O
must O
send O
Epaphroditus O
back O
to O
you O
. O

He O
is O
my O
brother O
in O
God O
's O
family O
, O
who O
works O
and O
serves O
with O
me O
in O
the O
Lord O
's O
army O
. O

When O
I O
needed O
help O
, O
you O
sent O
him O
to O
me O
, O
but O
now O
he O
wants O
very O
much O
to O
see O
all O
of O
you O
again O
. O

He O
is O
worried O
because O
you O
heard O
that O
he O
was O
sick O
. O

He O
was O
sick O
and O
near O
death O
. O

But O
God O
helped O
him O
and O
me O
too O
, O
so O
that O
I O
would O
not O
have O
even O
more O
grief O
. O

So O
I O
want O
very O
much O
to O
send O
him O
to O
you O
. O

When O
you O
see O
him O
, O
you O
can O
be O
happy O
. O

And O
I O
can O
stop O
worrying O
about O
you O
. O

Welcome O
him O
in O
the O
Lord O
with O
much O
joy O
. O

Give O
honor O
to O
people O
like O
Epaphroditus O
. O

He O
should O
be O
honored O
because O
he O
almost O
died O
for O
the O
work O
of O
Christ O
. O

He O
put O
his O
life O
in O
danger O
so O
that O
he O
could O
help O
me O
. O

This O
was O
help O
that O
you O
could O
not O
give O
me O
. O

My O
dear O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
I O
love O
you O
and O
want O
to O
see O
you O
. O

You O
bring O
me O
joy O
and O
make O
me O
proud O
of O
you O
. O

Continue O
following O
the O
Lord O
as O
I O
have O
told O
you O
. O

Euodia O
and O
Syntyche O
, O
you O
both O
belong O
to O
the O
Lord O
, O
so O
please O
agree O
with O
each O
other O
. O

For O
this O
I O
make O
a O
special O
request O
to O
my O
friend O
who O
has O
served O
with O
me O
so O
faithfully O
: O
Help O
these O
women O
. O

They O
worked O
hard O
with O
me O
in O
telling O
people O
the O
Good O
News O
, O
together O
with O
Clement O
and O
others O
who O
worked O
with O
me O
. O

Their O
names O
are O
written O
in O
the O
book O
of O
life O
. O

Always O
be O
filled O
with O
joy O
in O
the O
Lord O
. O

I O
will O
say O
it O
again O
. O

Be O
filled O
with O
joy O
. O

Let O
everyone O
see O
that O
you O
are O
gentle O
and O
kind O
. O

The O
Lord O
is O
coming O
soon O
. O

Do O
n't O
worry O
about O
anything O
, O
but O
pray O
and O
ask O
God O
for O
everything O
you O
need O
, O
always O
giving O
thanks O
for O
what O
you O
have O
. O

And O
because O
you O
belong O
to O
Christ O
Jesus O
, O
God O
's O
peace O
will O
stand O
guard O
over O
all O
your O
thoughts O
and O
feelings O
. O

His O
peace O
can O
do O
this O
far O
better O
than O
our O
human O
minds O
. O

Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
continue O
to O
think O
about O
what O
is O
good O
and O
worthy O
of O
praise O
. O

Think O
about O
what O
is O
true O
and O
honorable O
and O
right O
and O
pure O
and O
beautiful O
and O
respected O
. O

And O
do O
what O
you O
learned O
and O
received O
from O
me O
-- O
what O
I O
told O
you O
and O
what O
you O
saw O
me O
do O
. O

And O
the O
God O
who O
gives O
peace O
will O
be O
with O
you O
. O

I O
am O
so O
happy O
, O
and O
I O
thank O
the O
Lord O
that O
you O
have O
again O
shown O
your O
care O
for O
me O
. O

You O
continued O
to O
care O
about O
me O
, O
but O
there O
was O
no O
way O
for O
you O
to O
show O
it O
. O

I O
am O
telling O
you O
this O
, O
but O
not O
because O
I O
need O
something O
. O

I O
have O
learned O
to O
be O
satisfied O
with O
what O
I O
have O
and O
with O
whatever O
happens O
. O

I O
know O
how O
to O
live O
when O
I O
am O
poor O
and O
when O
I O
have O
plenty O
. O

I O
have O
learned O
the O
secret O
of O
how O
to O
live O
through O
any O
kind O
of O
situation O
-- O
when O
I O
have O
enough O
to O
eat O
or O
when O
I O
am O
hungry O
, O
when O
I O
have O
everything O
I O
need O
or O
when O
I O
have O
nothing O
. O

Christ O
is O
the O
one O
who O
gives O
me O
the O
strength O
I O
need O
to O
do O
whatever O
I O
must O
do O
. O

But O
it O
was O
good O
that O
you O
helped O
me O
when O
I O
needed O
help O
. O

You O
people O
in O
Philippi O
remember O
when O
I O
first O
told O
the O
Good O
News O
there O
. O

When O
I O
left O
Macedonia O
, O
you O
were O
the O
only O
church O
that O
gave O
me O
help O
. O

Several O
times O
you O
sent O
me O
things O
I O
needed O
when O
I O
was O
in O
Thessalonica O
. O

Really O
, O
it O
is O
not O
that O
I O
want O
to O
get O
gifts O
from O
you O
. O

But O
I O
want O
you O
to O
have O
the O
benefit O
that O
comes O
from O
giving O
. O

I O
have O
everything O
I O
need O
. O

I O
have O
even O
more O
than O
I O
need O
. O

I O
have O
all O
I O
need O
because O
Epaphroditus O
brought O
your O
gift O
to O
me O
. O

Your O
gift O
is O
like O
a O
sweet O
- O
smelling O
sacrifice O
offered O
to O
God O
. O

God O
accepts O
that O
sacrifice O
and O
it O
pleases O
him O
. O

My O
God O
will O
use O
his O
glorious O
riches O
to O
give O
you O
everything O
you O
need O
. O

He O
will O
do O
this O
through O
Christ O
Jesus O
. O

Glory O
to O
our O
God O
and O
Father O
forever O
and O
ever O
. O

Amen O
. O

Give O
our O
greetings O
to O
God O
's O
people O
there O
-- O

to O
each O
one O
who O
belongs O
to O
Christ O
Jesus O
. O

Those O
in O
God O
's O
family O
who O
are O
with O
me O
send O
you O
their O
greetings O
. O

And O
greetings O
to O
you O
from O
all O
of O
God O
's O
people O
here O
, O
especially O
those O
who O
work O
in O
the O
service O
of O
the O
emperor O
. O

The O
grace O
of O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
be O
with O
you O
all O
. O

Greetings O
from O
Paul O
and O
Timothy O
, O
servants O
of O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

To O
all O
of O
you O
in O
Philippi O
who O
are O
God O
's O
holy O
people O
in O
Christ O
Jesus O
, O
including O
your O
elders O
and O
special O
servants O
. O

Grace O
and O
peace O
to O
you O
from O
God O
our O
Father O
and O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

I O
thank O
God O
every O
time O
I O
remember O
you O
. O

And O
I O
always O
pray O
for O
all O
of O
you O
with O
joy O
. O

I O
thank O
God O
for O
the O
help O
you O
gave O
me O
while O
I O
told O
people O
the O
Good O
News O
. O

You O
helped O
from O
the O
first O
day O
you O
believed O
until O
now O
. O

I O
am O
sure O
that O
the O
good O
work O
God O
began O
in O
you O
will O
continue O
until O
he O
completes O
it O
on O
the O
day O
when O
Jesus O
Christ O
comes O
again O
. O

I O
know O
I O
am O
right O
to O
think O
like O
this O
about O
all O
of O
you O
because O
you O
are O
so O
close O
to O
my O
heart O
. O

This O
is O
because O
you O
have O
all O
played O
such O
an O
important O
part O
in O
God O
's O
grace O
to O
me O
-- O
now O
, O
during O
this O
time O
that O
I O
am O
in O
prison O
, O
and O
whenever O
I O
am O
defending O
and O
proving O
the O
truth O
of O
the O
Good O
News O
. O

God O
knows O
that O
I O
want O
very O
much O
to O
see O
you O
. O

I O
love O
all O
of O
you O
with O
the O
love O
of O
Christ O
Jesus O
. O

This O
is O
my O
prayer O
for O
you O
: O
that O
your O
love O
will O
grow O
more O
and O
more O
; O
that O
you O
will O
have O
knowledge O
and O
understanding O
with O
your O
love O
; O
that O
you O
will O
see O
the O
difference O
between O
what O
is O
important O
and O
what O
is O
not O
and O
choose O
what O
is O
important O
; O
that O
you O
will O
be O
pure O
and O
blameless O
for O
the O
coming O
of O
Christ O
; O
that O
your O
life O
will O
be O
full O
of O
the O
many O
good O
works O
that O
are O
produced O
by O
Jesus O
Christ O
to O
bring O
glory O
and O
praise O
to O
God O
. O

Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
I O
want O
you O
to O
know O
that O
all O
that O
has O
happened O
to O
me O
has O
helped O
to O
spread O
the O
Good O
News O
. O

All O
the O
Roman O
guards O
and O
all O
the O
others O
here O
know O
that O
I O
am O
in O
prison O
for O
serving O
Christ O
. O

My O
being O
in O
prison O
has O
caused O
most O
of O
the O
believers O
to O
put O
their O
trust O
in O
the O
Lord O
and O
to O
show O
more O
courage O
in O
telling O
people O
God O
's O
message O
. O

Some O
people O
are O
telling O
the O
message O
about O
Christ O
because O
they O
are O
jealous O
and O
bitter O
. O

Others O
do O
it O
because O
they O
want O
to O
help O
. O

They O
are O
doing O
it O
out O
of O
love O
. O

They O
know O
that O
God O
gave O
me O
the O
work O
of O
defending O
the O
Good O
News O
. O

But O
those O
others O
tell O
about O
Christ O
because O
of O
their O
selfish O
ambition O
. O

Their O
reason O
for O
doing O
it O
is O
wrong O
. O

They O
only O
do O
it O
because O
they O
think O
it O
will O
make O
trouble O
for O
me O
in O
prison O
. O

But O
that O
does O
n't O
matter O
. O

What O
is O
important O
is O
that O
they O
are O
telling O
people O
about O
Christ O
, O
whether O
they O
are O
sincere O
or O
not O
. O

So O
I O
am O
glad O
they O
are O
doing O
it O
. O

I O
will O
continue O
to O
be O
glad O
, O
because O
I O
know O
that O
your O
prayers O
and O
the O
help O
the O
Spirit O
of O
Jesus O
Christ O
gives O
me O
will O
cause O
this O
trouble O
to O
result O
in O
my O
freedom O
. O

I O
am O
full O
of O
hope O
and O
feel O
sure O
I O
will O
not O
have O
any O
reason O
to O
be O
ashamed O
. O

I O
am O
certain O
I O
will O
continue O
to O
have O
the O
same O
boldness O
to O
speak O
freely O
that O
I O
always O
have O
. O

I O
will O
let O
God O
use O
my O
life O
to O
bring O
more O
honor O
to O
Christ O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
matter O
whether O
I O
live O
or O
die O
. O

To O
me O
, O
the O
only O
important O
thing O
about O
living O
is O
Christ O
. O

And O
even O
death O
would O
be O
for O
my O
benefit O
. O

If O
I O
continue O
living O
here O
on O
earth O
, O
I O
will O
be O
able O
to O
work O
for O
the O
Lord O
. O

But O
what O
would O
I O
choose O
-- O
to O
live O
or O
to O
die O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

It O
would O
be O
a O
hard O
choice O
. O

Sometimes O
I O
want O
to O
leave O
this O
life O
and O
be O
with O
Christ O
. O

That O
would O
be O
much O
better O
for O
me O
; O
however O
, O
you O
people O
need O
me O
here O
alive O
. O

I O
am O
sure O
of O
this O
, O
so O
I O
know O
that O
I O
will O
stay O
here O
and O
be O
with O
you O
to O
help O
you O
grow O
and O
have O
joy O
in O
your O
faith O
. O

When O
I O
am O
there O
with O
you O
again O
, O
you O
will O
be O
bursting O
with O
pride O
over O
what O
Christ O
Jesus O
did O
to O
help O
me O
. O

Just O
be O
sure O
you O
live O
as O
God O
's O
people O
in O
a O
way O
that O
honors O
the O
Good O
News O
of O
Christ O
. O

Then O
if O
I O
come O
and O
visit O
you O
or O
if O
I O
am O
away O
from O
you O
, O
I O
will O
hear O
good O
things O
about O
you O
. O

I O
will O
know O
that O
you O
stand O
together O
with O
the O
same O
purpose O
and O
that O
you O
work O
together O
like O
a O
team O
to O
help O
others O
believe O
the O
Good O
News O
. O

And O
you O
will O
not O
be O
afraid O
of O
those O
who O
are O
against O
you O
. O

All O
of O
this O
is O
proof O
from O
God O
that O
you O
are O
being O
saved O
and O
that O
your O
enemies O
will O
be O
lost O
. O

God O
has O
blessed O
you O
in O
ways O
that O
serve O
Christ O
. O

He O
allowed O
you O
to O
believe O
in O
Christ O
. O

But O
that O
is O
not O
all O
. O

He O
has O
also O
given O
you O
the O
honor O
of O
suffering O
for O
Christ O
. O

Both O
of O
these O
bring O
glory O
to O
Christ O
. O

You O
saw O
the O
difficulties O
I O
had O
to O
face O
, O
and O
you O
hear O
that O
I O
am O
still O
having O
troubles O
. O

Now O
you O
must O
face O
them O
too O
. O

And O
now O
, O
my O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
be O
filled O
with O
joy O
in O
the O
Lord O
. O

It O
is O
no O
trouble O
for O
me O
to O
write O
the O
same O
things O
to O
you O
again O
. O

I O
want O
to O
be O
sure O
that O
you O
are O
prepared O
. O

Be O
careful O
of O
the O
dogs O
-- O
those O
people O
whose O
work O
does O
no O
one O
any O
good O
. O

They O
want O
to O
cut O
off O
everyone O
who O
is O
n't O
circumcised O
. O

But O
we O
are O
the O
ones O
who O
have O
the O
true O
circumcision O
-- O
we O
who O
worship O
God O
through O
his O
Spirit O
. O

We O
do O
n't O
trust O
in O
ourselves O
or O
anything O
we O
can O
do O
. O

We O
take O
pride O
only O
in O
Christ O
Jesus O
. O

Even O
if O
I O
am O
able O
to O
trust O
in O
myself O
, O
still O
I O
do O
n't O
do O
it O
. O

If O
anyone O
else O
thinks O
they O
have O
a O
reason O
to O
trust O
in O
themselves O
, O
they O
should O
know O
that O
I O
have O
a O
greater O
reason O
for O
doing O
so O
. O

I O
was O
circumcised O
on O
the O
eighth O
day O
after O
my O
birth O
. O

I O
am O
from O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
and O
the O
tribe O
of O
Benjamin O
. O

I O
am O
a O
true O
Jew O
, O
and O
so O
were O
my O
parents O
. O

The O
law O
was O
very O
important O
to O
me O
. O

That O
is O
why O
I O
became O
a O
Pharisee O
. O

I O
was O
such O
a O
fanatic O
that O
I O
persecuted O
the O
church O
. O

And O
no O
one O
could O
find O
fault O
with O
how O
I O
always O
obeyed O
the O
law O
. O

At O
one O
time O
all O
these O
things O
were O
important O
to O
me O
. O

But O
because O
of O
Christ O
, O
I O
decided O
that O
they O
are O
worth O
nothing O
. O

Not O
only O
these O
things O
, O
but O
now O
I O
think O
that O
all O
things O
are O
worth O
nothing O
compared O
with O
the O
greatness O
of O
knowing O
Christ O
Jesus O
my O
Lord O
. O

Because O
of O
Christ O
, O
I O
lost O
all O
these O
things O
, O
and O
now O
I O
know O
that O
they O
are O
all O
worthless O
trash O
. O

All O
I O
want O
now O
is O
Christ O
. O

I O
want O
to O
belong O
to O
him O
. O

In O
Christ O
I O
am O
right O
with O
God O
, O
but O
my O
being O
right O
does O
not O
come O
from O
following O
the O
law O
. O

It O
comes O
from O
God O
through O
faith O
. O

God O
uses O
my O
faith O
in O
Christ O
to O
make O
me O
right O
with O
him O
. O

All O
I O
want O
is O
to O
know O
Christ O
and O
the O
power O
that O
raised O
him O
from O
death O
. O

I O
want O
to O
share O
in O
his O
sufferings O
and O
be O
like O
him O
even O
in O
his O
death O
. O

Then O
there O
is O
hope O
that O
I O
myself O
will O
somehow O
be O
raised O
from O
death O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
mean O
that O
I O
am O
exactly O
what O
God O
wants O
me O
to O
be O
. O

I O
have O
not O
yet O
reached O
that O
goal O
. O

But O
I O
continue O
trying O
to O
reach O
it O
and O
make O
it O
mine O
. O

That O
's O
what O
Christ O
Jesus O
wants O
me O
to O
do O
. O

It O
is O
the O
reason O
he O
made O
me O
his O
. O

Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
I O
know O
that O
I O
still O
have O
a O
long O
way O
to O
go O
. O

But O
there O
is O
one O
thing O
I O
do O
: O
I O
forget O
what O
is O
in O
the O
past O
and O
try O
as O
hard O
as O
I O
can O
to O
reach O
the O
goal O
before O
me O
. O

I O
keep O
running O
hard O
toward O
the O
finish O
line O
to O
get O
the O
prize O
that O
is O
mine O
because O
God O
has O
called O
me O
through O
Christ O
Jesus O
to O
life O
up O
there O
in O
heaven O
. O

All O
of O
us O
who O
have O
grown O
to O
be O
spiritually O
mature O
should O
think O
this O
way O
too O
. O

And O
if O
there O
is O
any O
of O
this O
that O
you O
do O
n't O
agree O
with O
, O
God O
will O
make O
it O
clear O
to O
you O
. O

But O
we O
should O
continue O
following O
the O
truth O
we O
already O
have O
. O

Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
join O
together O
in O
following O
my O
example O
. O

Also O
, O
learn O
by O
watching O
those O
who O
are O
living O
the O
way O
we O
showed O
you O
. O

There O
are O
many O
who O
live O
like O
enemies O
of O
the O
cross O
of O
Christ O
. O

I O
have O
often O
told O
you O
about O
them O
. O

And O
it O
makes O
me O
cry O
to O
tell O
you O
about O
them O
now O
. O

The O
way O
they O
live O
is O
leading O
them O
to O
destruction O
. O

They O
have O
replaced O
God O
with O
their O
own O
desires O
. O

They O
do O
shameful O
things O
, O
and O
they O
are O
proud O
of O
what O
they O
do O
. O

They O
think O
only O
about O
earthly O
things O
. O

But O
the O
government O
that O
rules O
us O
is O
in O
heaven O
. O

We O
are O
waiting O
for O
our O
Savior O
, O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
, O
to O
come O
from O
there O
. O

He O
will O
change O
our O
humble O
bodies O
and O
make O
them O
like O
his O
own O
glorious O
body O
. O

Christ O
can O
do O
this O
by O
his O
power O
, O
with O
which O
he O
is O
able O
to O
rule O
everything O
. O

So O
I O
ask O
, O
`` O
Did O
God O
force O
his O
people O
to O
leave O
him O
? O
'' O

Of O
course O
not O
. O

I O
myself O
am O
an O
Israelite O
. O

I O
am O
from O
the O
family O
of O
Abraham O
, O
from O
the O
tribe O
of O
Benjamin O
. O

God O
chose O
the O
Israelites O
to O
be O
his O
people O
before O
they O
were O
born O
. O

And O
he O
did O
not O
force O
them O
to O
leave O
. O

Surely O
you O
know O
what O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
about O
Elijah O
. O

The O
Scriptures O
tell O
about O
Elijah O
praying O
to O
God O
against O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
they O
have O
killed O
your O
prophets O
and O
destroyed O
your O
altars O
. O

I O
am O
the O
only O
prophet O
still O
living O
, O
and O
they O
are O
trying O
to O
kill O
me O
now O
. O
'' O

But O
what O
answer O
did O
God O
give O
to O
Elijah O
? O

God O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
have O
kept O
for O
myself O
seven O
thousand O
men O
who O
have O
never O
given O
worship O
to O
Baal O
. O
'' O

It O
is O
the O
same O
now O
. O

God O
has O
chosen O
a O
few O
people O
by O
his O
grace O
. O

And O
if O
he O
chose O
them O
by O
grace O
, O
then O
it O
is O
not O
what O
they O
have O
done O
that O
made O
them O
his O
people O
. O

If O
they O
could O
be O
made O
his O
people O
by O
what O
they O
did O
, O
his O
gift O
of O
grace O
would O
not O
really O
be O
a O
gift O
. O

So O
this O
is O
what O
has O
happened O
: O
The O
people O
of O
Israel O
wanted O
God O
's O
blessing O
, O
but O
they O
did O
not O
all O
get O
it O
. O

The O
people O
he O
chose O
did O
get O
his O
blessing O
, O
but O
the O
others O
became O
hard O
and O
refused O
to O
listen O
to O
him O
. O

As O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
God O
caused O
the O
people O
to O
fall O
asleep O
. O
'' O

`` O
God O
closed O
their O
eyes O
so O
that O
they O
could O
not O
see O
, O
and O
he O
closed O
their O
ears O
so O
that O
they O
could O
not O
hear O
. O

This O
continues O
until O
now O
. O
'' O

And O
David O
says O
, O
`` O
Let O
those O
people O
be O
caught O
and O
trapped O
at O
their O
own O
feasts O
. O

Let O
them O
fall O
and O
be O
punished O
. O

Let O
their O
eyes O
be O
closed O
so O
that O
they O
can O
not O
see O
. O

And O
let O
them O
be O
troubled O
forever O
. O
'' O

So O
I O
ask O
: O
When O
the O
Jews O
fell O
, O
did O
that O
fall O
destroy O
them O
? O

No O
! O

But O
their O
mistake O
brought O
salvation O
to O
those O
who O
are O
not O
Jews O
. O

The O
purpose O
of O
this O
was O
to O
make O
the O
Jews O
jealous O
. O

Their O
mistake O
brought O
rich O
blessings O
to O
the O
world O
. O

And O
what O
they O
lost O
brought O
rich O
blessings O
to O
the O
non-Jewish O
people O
. O

So O
surely O
the O
world O
will O
get O
much O
richer O
blessings O
when O
enough O
Jews O
become O
the O
kind O
of O
people O
God O
wants O
. O

Now O
I O
am O
speaking O
to O
you O
people O
who O
are O
not O
Jews O
. O

I O
am O
an O
apostle O
to O
the O
non-Jewish O
people O
. O

So O
while O
I O
have O
that O
work O
, O
I O
will O
do O
the O
best O
I O
can O
. O

I O
hope O
I O
can O
make O
my O
own O
people O
jealous O
. O

That O
way O
, O
maybe O
I O
can O
help O
some O
of O
them O
to O
be O
saved O
. O

God O
turned O
away O
from O
the O
Jews O
. O

When O
that O
happened O
, O
he O
became O
friends O
with O
the O
other O
people O
in O
the O
world O
. O

So O
when O
he O
accepts O
the O
Jews O
, O
it O
will O
be O
like O
bringing O
people O
to O
life O
after O
death O
. O

If O
the O
first O
piece O
of O
bread O
is O
offered O
to O
God O
, O
then O
the O
whole O
loaf O
is O
made O
holy O
. O

If O
the O
roots O
of O
a O
tree O
are O
holy O
, O
the O
tree O
's O
branches O
are O
holy O
too O
. O

It O
is O
as O
if O
some O
of O
the O
branches O
from O
an O
olive O
tree O
have O
been O
broken O
off O
, O
and O
the O
branch O
of O
a O
wild O
olive O
tree O
has O
been O
joined O
to O
that O
first O
tree O
. O

If O
you O
are O
not O
a O
Jew O
, O
you O
are O
the O
same O
as O
that O
wild O
branch O
, O
and O
you O
now O
share O
the O
strength O
and O
life O
of O
the O
first O
tree O
. O

But O
do O
n't O
act O
as O
if O
you O
are O
better O
than O
those O
branches O
that O
were O
broken O
off O
. O

You O
have O
no O
reason O
to O
be O
proud O
of O
yourself O
, O
because O
you O
do O
n't O
give O
life O
to O
the O
root O
. O

The O
root O
gives O
life O
to O
you O
. O

You O
might O
say O
, O
`` O
Branches O
were O
broken O
off O
so O
that O
I O
could O
be O
joined O
to O
their O
tree O
. O
'' O

That O
is O
true O
. O

But O
those O
branches O
were O
broken O
off O
because O
they O
did O
not O
believe O
. O

And O
you O
continue O
to O
be O
part O
of O
the O
tree O
only O
because O
you O
believe O
. O

Do O
n't O
be O
proud O
, O
but O
be O
afraid O
. O

If O
God O
did O
not O
let O
the O
natural O
branches O
of O
that O
tree O
stay O
, O
he O
will O
not O
let O
you O
stay O
if O
you O
stop O
believing O
. O

So O
you O
see O
that O
God O
is O
kind O
, O
but O
he O
can O
also O
be O
very O
strict O
. O

He O
punishes O
those O
who O
stop O
following O
him O
. O

But O
he O
is O
kind O
to O
you O
, O
if O
you O
continue O
trusting O
in O
his O
kindness O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
continue O
depending O
on O
him O
, O
you O
will O
be O
cut O
off O
from O
the O
tree O
. O

And O
if O
the O
Jews O
will O
believe O
in O
God O
again O
, O
he O
will O
accept O
them O
back O
. O

He O
is O
able O
to O
put O
them O
back O
where O
they O
were O
. O

It O
is O
not O
natural O
for O
a O
wild O
branch O
to O
become O
part O
of O
a O
good O
tree O
. O

But O
you O
non-Jewish O
people O
are O
like O
a O
branch O
cut O
from O
a O
wild O
olive O
tree O
. O

And O
you O
were O
joined O
to O
a O
good O
olive O
tree O
. O

But O
those O
Jews O
are O
like O
a O
branch O
that O
grew O
from O
the O
good O
tree O
. O

So O
surely O
they O
can O
be O
joined O
to O
their O
own O
tree O
again O
. O

I O
want O
you O
to O
understand O
this O
secret O
truth O
, O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
. O

This O
truth O
will O
help O
you O
understand O
that O
you O
do O
n't O
know O
everything O
. O

The O
truth O
is O
this O
: O
Part O
of O
Israel O
has O
been O
made O
stubborn O
, O
but O
that O
will O
change O
when O
enough O
non-Jewish O
people O
have O
come O
to O
God O
. O

And O
that O
is O
how O
all O
Israel O
will O
be O
saved O
. O

The O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
The O
Savior O
will O
come O
from O
Zion O
; O
he O
will O
take O
away O
all O
evil O
from O
the O
family O
of O
Jacob O
. O

And O
I O
will O
make O
this O
agreement O
with O
those O
people O
when O
I O
take O
away O
their O
sins O
. O
'' O

The O
Jews O
refuse O
to O
accept O
the O
Good O
News O
, O
so O
they O
are O
God O
's O
enemies O
. O

This O
has O
happened O
to O
help O
you O
who O
are O
not O
Jews O
. O

But O
they O
are O
still O
God O
's O
chosen O
people O
, O
and O
he O
loves O
them O
because O
of O
the O
promises O
he O
made O
to O
their O
ancestors O
. O

God O
never O
changes O
his O
mind O
about O
the O
people O
he O
calls O
. O

He O
never O
decides O
to O
take O
back O
the O
blessings O
he O
has O
given O
them O
. O

At O
one O
time O
you O
refused O
to O
obey O
God O
. O

But O
now O
you O
have O
received O
mercy O
, O
because O
the O
Jews O
refused O
to O
obey O
. O

And O
now O
they O
are O
the O
ones O
who O
refuse O
to O
obey O
, O
because O
God O
showed O
mercy O
to O
you O
. O

But O
this O
happened O
so O
that O
they O
can O
also O
receive O
mercy O
from O
him O
. O

All O
people O
have O
refused O
to O
obey O
God O
. O

And O
he O
has O
put O
them O
all O
together O
as O
people O
who O
do O
n't O
obey O
him O
so O
that O
he O
can O
show O
mercy O
to O
everyone O
. O

Yes O
, O
God O
's O
riches O
are O
very O
great O
! O

His O
wisdom O
and O
knowledge O
have O
no O
end O
! O

No O
one O
can O
explain O
what O
God O
decides O
. O

No O
one O
can O
understand O
his O
ways O
. O

As O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
Who O
can O
know O
what O
is O
on O
the O
Lord O
's O
mind O
? O

Who O
is O
able O
to O
give O
him O
advice O
? O
'' O

`` O
Who O
has O
ever O
given O
God O
anything O
? O

God O
owes O
nothing O
to O
anyone O
. O
'' O

Yes O
, O
God O
made O
all O
things O
. O

And O
everything O
continues O
through O
him O
and O
for O
him O
. O

To O
God O
be O
the O
glory O
forever O
! O

Amen O
. O

So O
, O
do O
Jews O
have O
anything O
that O
others O
do O
n't O
have O
? O

Do O
they O
get O
any O
benefit O
from O
being O
circumcised O
? O

Yes O
, O
the O
Jews O
have O
many O
benefits O
. O

The O
most O
important O
one O
is O
this O
: O
God O
trusted O
the O
Jews O
with O
his O
teachings O
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
some O
Jews O
were O
not O
faithful O
to O
God O
. O

But O
will O
that O
stop O
God O
from O
doing O
what O
he O
promised O
? O

No O
, O
even O
if O
everyone O
else O
is O
a O
liar O
, O
God O
will O
always O
do O
what O
he O
says O
. O

As O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
about O
him O
, O
`` O
You O
will O
be O
proved O
right O
in O
what O
you O
say O
, O
and O
you O
will O
win O
when O
people O
accuse O
you O
. O
'' O

When O
we O
do O
wrong O
, O
that O
shows O
more O
clearly O
that O
God O
is O
right O
. O

So O
can O
we O
say O
that O
God O
does O
wrong O
when O
he O
punishes O
us O
? O

-LRB- O
That O
's O
the O
way O
some O
people O
think O
. O
-RRB- O

Of O
course O
not O
. O

If O
God O
could O
not O
punish O
us O
, O
how O
could O
he O
judge O
the O
world O
? O

Someone O
might O
say O
, O
`` O
When O
I O
lie O
, O
it O
really O
gives O
God O
glory O
, O
because O
my O
lie O
makes O
his O
truth O
easier O
to O
see O
. O

So O
why O
am O
I O
judged O
a O
sinner O
? O
'' O

It O
would O
be O
the O
same O
to O
say O
, O
`` O
We O
should O
do O
evil O
so O
that O
good O
will O
come O
. O
'' O

Many O
people O
criticize O
us O
, O
saying O
that O
's O
what O
we O
teach O
. O

They O
are O
wrong O
, O
and O
they O
should O
be O
condemned O
for O
saying O
that O
. O

So O
are O
we O
Jews O
better O
than O
other O
people O
? O

No O
, O
we O
have O
already O
said O
that O
those O
who O
are O
Jews O
, O
as O
well O
as O
those O
who O
are O
not O
Jews O
, O
are O
the O
same O
. O

They O
are O
all O
guilty O
of O
sin O
. O

As O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
There O
is O
no O
one O
doing O
what O
is O
right O
, O
not O
even O
one O
. O

There O
is O
no O
one O
who O
understands O
. O

There O
is O
no O
one O
who O
is O
trying O
to O
be O
with O
God O
. O

They O
have O
all O
turned O
away O
from O
him O
, O
and O
now O
they O
are O
of O
no O
use O
to O
anyone O
. O

There O
is O
no O
one O
who O
does O
good O
, O
not O
even O
one O
. O
'' O

`` O
Their O
words O
come O
from O
mouths O
that O
are O
like O
open O
graves O
. O

They O
use O
their O
lying O
tongues O
to O
deceive O
others O
. O
'' O

`` O
Their O
words O
are O
like O
the O
poison O
of O
snakes O
. O
'' O

`` O
Their O
mouths O
are O
full O
of O
cursing O
and O
angry O
words O
. O
'' O

`` O
They O
are O
always O
ready O
to O
kill O
someone O
. O

Everywhere O
they O
go O
they O
cause O
trouble O
and O
ruin O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
to O
live O
in O
peace O
. O
'' O

`` O
They O
have O
no O
fear O
or O
respect O
for O
God O
. O
'' O

What O
the O
law O
says O
is O
for O
those O
who O
are O
under O
the O
law O
. O

It O
stops O
anyone O
from O
making O
excuses O
. O

And O
it O
brings O
the O
whole O
world O
under O
God O
's O
judgment O
, O
because O
no O
one O
can O
be O
made O
right O
with O
God O
by O
following O
the O
law O
. O

The O
law O
only O
shows O
us O
our O
sin O
. O

But O
God O
has O
a O
way O
to O
make O
people O
right O
, O
and O
it O
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
law O
. O

He O
has O
now O
shown O
us O
that O
new O
way O
, O
which O
the O
law O
and O
the O
prophets O
told O
us O
about O
. O

God O
makes O
people O
right O
through O
their O
faith O
in O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

He O
does O
this O
for O
all O
who O
believe O
in O
Christ O
. O

Everyone O
is O
the O
same O
. O

All O
have O
sinned O
and O
are O
not O
good O
enough O
to O
share O
God O
's O
divine O
greatness O
. O

They O
are O
made O
right O
with O
God O
by O
his O
grace O
. O

This O
is O
a O
free O
gift O
. O

They O
are O
made O
right O
with O
God O
by O
being O
made O
free O
from O
sin O
through O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

God O
gave O
Jesus O
as O
a O
way O
to O
forgive O
people O
's O
sins O
through O
their O
faith O
in O
him O
. O

God O
can O
forgive O
them O
because O
the O
blood O
sacrifice O
of O
Jesus O
pays O
for O
their O
sins O
. O

God O
gave O
Jesus O
to O
show O
that O
he O
always O
does O
what O
is O
right O
and O
fair O
. O

He O
was O
right O
in O
the O
past O
when O
he O
was O
patient O
and O
did O
not O
punish O
people O
for O
their O
sins O
. O

And O
in O
our O
own O
time O
he O
still O
does O
what O
is O
right O
. O

God O
worked O
all O
this O
out O
in O
a O
way O
that O
allows O
him O
to O
judge O
people O
fairly O
and O
still O
make O
right O
any O
person O
who O
has O
faith O
in O
Jesus O
. O

So O
do O
we O
have O
any O
reason O
to O
boast O
about O
ourselves O
? O

No O
reason O
at O
all O
. O

And O
why O
not O
? O

Because O
we O
are O
depending O
on O
the O
way O
of O
faith O
, O
not O
on O
what O
we O
have O
done O
in O
following O
the O
law O
. O

I O
mean O
we O
are O
made O
right O
with O
God O
through O
faith O
, O
not O
through O
what O
we O
have O
done O
to O
follow O
the O
law O
. O

This O
is O
what O
we O
believe O
. O

God O
is O
not O
only O
the O
God O
of O
the O
Jews O
. O

He O
is O
also O
the O
God O
of O
those O
who O
are O
not O
Jews O
. O

There O
is O
only O
one O
God O
. O

He O
will O
make O
Jews O
right O
with O
him O
by O
their O
faith O
, O
and O
he O
will O
also O
make O
non-Jews O
right O
with O
him O
through O
their O
faith O
. O

So O
do O
we O
destroy O
the O
law O
by O
following O
the O
way O
of O
faith O
? O

Not O
at O
all O
! O

In O
fact O
, O
faith O
causes O
us O
to O
be O
what O
the O
law O
actually O
wants O
. O

So O
do O
you O
think O
we O
should O
continue O
sinning O
so O
that O
God O
will O
give O
us O
more O
and O
more O
grace O
? O

Of O
course O
not O
! O

Our O
old O
sinful O
life O
ended O
. O

It O
's O
dead O
. O

So O
how O
can O
we O
continue O
living O
in O
sin O
? O

Did O
you O
forget O
that O
all O
of O
us O
became O
part O
of O
Christ O
Jesus O
when O
we O
were O
baptized O
? O

In O
our O
baptism O
we O
shared O
in O
his O
death O
. O

So O
when O
we O
were O
baptized O
, O
we O
were O
buried O
with O
Christ O
and O
took O
part O
in O
his O
death O
. O

And O
just O
as O
Christ O
was O
raised O
from O
death O
by O
the O
wonderful O
power O
of O
the O
Father O
, O
so O
we O
can O
now O
live O
a O
new O
life O
. O

Christ O
died O
, O
and O
we O
have O
been O
joined O
with O
him O
by O
dying O
too O
. O

So O
we O
will O
also O
be O
joined O
with O
him O
by O
rising O
from O
death O
as O
he O
did O
. O

We O
know O
that O
our O
old O
life O
was O
put O
to O
death O
on O
the O
cross O
with O
Christ O
. O

This O
happened O
so O
that O
our O
sinful O
selves O
would O
have O
no O
power O
over O
us O
. O

Then O
we O
would O
not O
be O
slaves O
to O
sin O
. O

Anyone O
who O
has O
died O
is O
made O
free O
from O
sin O
's O
control O
. O

If O
we O
died O
with O
Christ O
, O
we O
know O
that O
we O
will O
also O
live O
with O
him O
. O

Christ O
was O
raised O
from O
death O
. O

And O
we O
know O
that O
he O
can O
not O
die O
again O
. O

Death O
has O
no O
power O
over O
him O
now O
. O

Yes O
, O
when O
Christ O
died O
, O
he O
died O
to O
defeat O
the O
power O
of O
sin O
one O
time O
-- O
enough O
for O
all O
time O
. O

He O
now O
has O
a O
new O
life O
, O
and O
his O
new O
life O
is O
with O
God O
. O

In O
the O
same O
way O
, O
you O
should O
see O
yourselves O
as O
being O
dead O
to O
the O
power O
of O
sin O
and O
alive O
for O
God O
through O
Christ O
Jesus O
. O

But O
do O
n't O
let O
sin O
control O
your O
life O
here O
on O
earth O
. O

You O
must O
not O
be O
ruled O
by O
the O
things O
your O
sinful O
self O
makes O
you O
want O
to O
do O
. O

Do O
n't O
offer O
the O
parts O
of O
your O
body O
to O
serve O
sin O
. O

Do O
n't O
use O
your O
bodies O
to O
do O
evil O
, O
but O
offer O
yourselves O
to O
God O
, O
as O
people O
who O
have O
died O
and O
now O
live O
. O

Offer O
the O
parts O
of O
your O
body O
to O
God O
to O
be O
used O
for O
doing O
good O
. O

Sin O
will O
not O
be O
your O
master O
, O
because O
you O
are O
not O
under O
law O
. O

You O
now O
live O
under O
God O
's O
grace O
. O

So O
what O
should O
we O
do O
? O

Should O
we O
sin O
because O
we O
are O
under O
grace O
and O
not O
under O
law O
? O

Certainly O
not O
! O

Surely O
you O
know O
that O
you O
become O
the O
slaves O
of O
whatever O
you O
give O
yourselves O
to O
. O

Anything O
or O
anyone O
you O
follow O
will O
be O
your O
master O
. O

You O
can O
follow O
sin O
, O
or O
you O
can O
obey O
God O
. O

Following O
sin O
brings O
spiritual O
death O
, O
but O
obeying O
God O
makes O
you O
right O
with O
him O
. O

In O
the O
past O
you O
were O
slaves O
to O
sin O
-- O
sin O
controlled O
you O
. O

But O
thank O
God O
, O
you O
fully O
obeyed O
what O
you O
were O
taught O
. O

You O
were O
made O
free O
from O
sin O
, O
and O
now O
you O
are O
slaves O
to O
what O
is O
right O
. O

I O
use O
this O
example O
from O
everyday O
life O
because O
you O
need O
help O
in O
understanding O
spiritual O
truths O
. O

In O
the O
past O
you O
offered O
the O
parts O
of O
your O
body O
to O
be O
slaves O
to O
your O
immoral O
and O
sinful O
thoughts O
. O

The O
result O
was O
that O
you O
lived O
only O
for O
sin O
. O

In O
the O
same O
way O
, O
you O
must O
now O
offer O
yourselves O
to O
be O
slaves O
to O
what O
is O
right O
. O

Then O
you O
will O
live O
only O
for O
God O
. O

In O
the O
past O
you O
were O
slaves O
to O
sin O
, O
and O
you O
did O
not O
even O
think O
about O
doing O
right O
. O

You O
did O
evil O
things O
, O
and O
now O
you O
are O
ashamed O
of O
what O
you O
did O
. O

Did O
those O
things O
help O
you O
? O

No O
, O
they O
only O
brought O
death O
. O

But O
now O
you O
are O
free O
from O
sin O
. O

You O
have O
become O
slaves O
of O
God O
, O
and O
the O
result O
is O
that O
you O
live O
only O
for O
God O
. O

This O
will O
bring O
you O
eternal O
life O
. O

When O
people O
sin O
, O
they O
earn O
what O
sin O
pays O
-- O
death O
. O

But O
God O
gives O
his O
people O
a O
free O
gift O
-- O
eternal O
life O
in O
Christ O
Jesus O
our O
Lord O
. O

I O
want O
you O
to O
know O
that O
you O
can O
trust O
our O
sister O
in O
Christ O
, O
Phoebe O
. O

She O
is O
a O
special O
servant O
of O
the O
church O
in O
Cenchrea O
. O

I O
ask O
you O
to O
accept O
her O
in O
the O
Lord O
. O

Accept O
her O
the O
way O
God O
's O
people O
should O
. O

Help O
her O
with O
anything O
she O
needs O
from O
you O
. O

She O
has O
helped O
me O
very O
much O

has O
helped O
many O
others O

Erastus O
is O

. O

Praise O
God O
! O

He O
is O
the O
one O
who O
can O
make O
you O
strong O
in O
faith O
. O

He O
can O
use O
the O
Good O
News O
that O
I O
teach O
to O
make O
you O
strong O
. O

It O
is O
the O
message O
about O
Jesus O
Christ O
that O
I O
tell O
people O
. O

That O
message O
is O
the O
secret O
truth O
that O
was O
hidden O
for O
ages O
and O
ages O
but O
has O
been O
made O
known O
. O

It O
has O
now O
been O
shown O
to O
us O
. O

It O
was O
made O
known O
by O
what O
the O
prophets O
wrote O
, O
as O
God O
commanded O
. O

And O
it O
has O
now O
been O
made O
known O
to O
all O
people O
so O
that O
they O
can O
believe O
and O
obey O
God O
, O
who O
lives O
forever O
. O

Glory O
forever O
to O
the O
only O
wise O
God O
through O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

Amen O
. O

So O
now O
anyone O
who O
is O
in O
Christ O
Jesus O
is O
not O
judged O
guilty O
. O

That O
is O
because O
in O
Christ O
Jesus O
the O
law O
of O
the O
Spirit O
that O
brings O
life O
made O
you O
free O
. O

It O
made O
you O
free O
from O
the O
law O
that O
brings O
sin O
and O
death O
. O

The O
law O
was O
without O
power O
because O
it O
was O
made O
weak O
by O
our O
sinful O
selves O
. O

But O
God O
did O
what O
the O
law O
could O
not O
do O
: O
He O
sent O
his O
own O
Son O
to O
earth O
with O
the O
same O
human O
life O
that O
everyone O
else O
uses O
for O
sin O
. O

God O
sent O
him O
to O
be O
an O
offering O
to O
pay O
for O
sin O
. O

So O
God O
used O
a O
human O
life O
to O
destroy O
sin O
. O

He O
did O
this O
so O
that O
we O
could O
be O
right O
just O
as O
the O
law O
said O
we O
must O
be O
. O

Now O
we O
do O
n't O
live O
following O
our O
sinful O
selves O
. O

We O
live O
following O
the O
Spirit O
. O

People O
who O
live O
following O
their O
sinful O
selves O
think O
only O
about O
what O
they O
want O
. O

But O
those O
who O
live O
following O
the O
Spirit O
are O
thinking O
about O
what O
the O
Spirit O
wants O
them O
to O
do O
. O

If O
your O
thinking O
is O
controlled O
by O
your O
sinful O
self O
, O
there O
is O
spiritual O
death O
. O

But O
if O
your O
thinking O
is O
controlled O
by O
the O
Spirit O
, O
there O
is O
life O
and O
peace O
. O

Why O
is O
this O
true O
? O

Because O
anyone O
whose O
thinking O
is O
controlled O
by O
their O
sinful O
self O
is O
against O
God O
. O

They O
refuse O
to O
obey O
God O
's O
law O
. O

And O
really O
they O
are O
not O
able O
to O
obey O
it O
. O

Those O
who O
are O
ruled O
by O
their O
sinful O
selves O
can O
not O
please O
God O
. O

But O
you O
are O
not O
ruled O
by O
your O
sinful O
selves O
. O

You O
are O
ruled O
by O
the O
Spirit O
, O
if O
that O
Spirit O
of O
God O
really O
lives O
in O
you O
. O

But O
whoever O
does O
not O
have O
the O
Spirit O
of O
Christ O
does O
not O
belong O
to O
Christ O
. O

Your O
body O
will O
always O
be O
dead O
because O
of O
sin O
. O

But O
if O
Christ O
is O
in O
you O
, O
then O
the O
Spirit O
gives O
you O
life O
, O
because O
Christ O
made O
you O
right O
with O
God O
. O

God O
raised O
Jesus O
from O
death O
. O

And O
if O
God O
's O
Spirit O
lives O
in O
you O
, O
he O
will O
also O
give O
life O
to O
your O
bodies O
that O
die O
. O

Yes O
, O
God O
is O
the O
one O
who O
raised O
Christ O
from O
death O
, O
and O
he O
will O
raise O
you O
to O
life O
through O
his O
Spirit O
living O
in O
you O
. O

So O
, O
my O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
we O
must O
not O
be O
ruled O
by O
our O
sinful O
selves O
. O

We O
must O
not O
live O
the O
way O
our O
sinful O
selves O
want O
. O

If O
you O
use O
your O
lives O
to O
do O
what O
your O
sinful O
selves O
want O
, O
you O
will O
die O
spiritually O
. O

But O
if O
you O
use O
the O
Spirit O
's O
help O
to O
stop O
doing O
the O
wrong O
things O
you O
do O
with O
your O
body O
, O
you O
will O
have O
true O
life O
. O

The O
true O
children O
of O
God O
are O
those O
who O
let O
God O
's O
Spirit O
lead O
them O
. O

The O
Spirit O
that O
we O
received O
is O
not O
a O
spirit O
that O
makes O
us O
slaves O
again O
and O
causes O
us O
to O
fear O
. O

The O
Spirit O
that O
we O
have O
makes O
us O
God O
's O
chosen O
children O
. O

And O
with O
that O
Spirit O
we O
cry O
out O
, O
`` O
Abba O
, O
Father O
. O
'' O

And O
the O
Spirit O
himself O
speaks O
to O
our O
spirits O
and O
makes O
us O
sure O
that O
we O
are O
God O
's O
children O
. O

If O
we O
are O
God O
's O
children O
, O
we O
will O
get O
the O
blessings O
God O
has O
for O
his O
people O
. O

He O
will O
give O
us O
all O
that O
he O
has O
given O
Christ O
. O

But O
we O
must O
suffer O
like O
Christ O
suffered O
. O

Then O
we O
will O
be O
able O
to O
share O
his O
glory O
. O

We O
have O
sufferings O
now O
, O
but O
these O
are O
nothing O
compared O
to O
the O
great O
glory O
that O
will O
be O
given O
to O
us O
. O

Everything O
that O
God O
made O
is O
waiting O
with O
excitement O
for O
the O
time O
when O
he O
will O
show O
the O
world O
who O
his O
children O
are O
. O

The O
whole O
world O
wants O
very O
much O
for O
that O
to O
happen O
. O

Everything O
God O
made O
was O
allowed O
to O
become O
like O
something O
that O
can O
not O
fulfill O
its O
purpose O
. O

That O
was O
not O
its O
choice O
, O
but O
God O
made O
it O
happen O
with O
this O
hope O
in O
view O
: O
That O
the O
creation O
would O
be O
made O
free O
from O
ruin O
-- O
that O
everything O
God O
made O
would O
have O
the O
same O
freedom O
and O
glory O
that O
belong O
to O
God O
's O
children O
. O

We O
know O
that O
everything O
God O
made O
has O
been O
waiting O
until O
now O
in O
pain O
like O
a O
woman O
ready O
to O
give O
birth O
to O
a O
child O
. O

Not O
only O
the O
world O
, O
but O
we O
also O
have O
been O
waiting O
with O
pain O
inside O
us O
. O

We O
have O
the O
Spirit O
as O
the O
first O
part O
of O
God O
's O
promise O
. O

So O
we O
are O
waiting O
for O
God O
to O
finish O
making O
us O
his O
own O
children O
. O

I O
mean O
we O
are O
waiting O
for O
our O
bodies O
to O
be O
made O
free O
. O

We O
were O
saved O
to O
have O
this O
hope O
. O

If O
we O
can O
see O
what O
we O
are O
waiting O
for O
, O
that O
is O
not O
really O
hope O
. O

People O
do O
n't O
hope O
for O
something O
they O
already O
have O
. O

But O
we O
are O
hoping O
for O
something O
we O
do O
n't O
have O
yet O
, O
and O
we O
are O
waiting O
for O
it O
patiently O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
Spirit O
helps O
us O
. O

We O
are O
very O
weak O
, O
but O
the O
Spirit O
helps O
us O
with O
our O
weakness O
. O

We O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
to O
pray O
as O
we O
should O
, O
but O
the O
Spirit O
himself O
speaks O
to O
God O
for O
us O
. O

He O
begs O
God O
for O
us O
, O
speaking O
to O
him O
with O
feelings O
too O
deep O
for O
words O
. O

God O
already O
knows O
our O
deepest O
thoughts O
. O

And O
he O
understands O
what O
the O
Spirit O
is O
saying O
, O
because O
the O
Spirit O
speaks O
for O
his O
people O
in O
the O
way O
that O
agrees O
with O
what O
God O
wants O
. O

We O
know O
that O
in O
everything O
God O
works O
for O
the O
good O
of O
those O
who O
love O
him O
. O

These O
are O
the O
people O
God O
chose O
, O
because O
that O
was O
his O
plan O
. O

God O
knew O
them O
before O
he O
made O
the O
world O
. O

And O
he O
decided O
that O
they O
would O
be O
like O
his O
Son O
. O

Then O
Jesus O
would O
be O
the O
firstborn O
of O
many O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
. O

God O
planned O
for O
them O
to O
be O
like O
his O
Son O
. O

He O
chose O
them O
and O
made O
them O
right O
with O
him O
. O

And O
after O
he O
made O
them O
right O
, O
he O
gave O
them O
his O
glory O
. O

So O
what O
should O
we O
say O
about O
this O
? O

If O
God O
is O
for O
us O
, O
no O
one O
can O
stand O
against O
us O
. O

And O
God O
is O
with O
us O
. O

He O
even O
let O
his O
own O
Son O
suffer O
for O
us O
. O

God O
gave O
his O
Son O
for O
all O
of O
us O
. O

So O
now O
with O
Jesus O
, O
God O
will O
surely O
give O
us O
all O
things O
. O

Who O
can O
accuse O
the O
people O
God O
has O
chosen O
? O

No O
one O
! O

God O
is O
the O
one O
who O
makes O
them O
right O
. O

Who O
can O
say O
that O
God O
's O
people O
are O
guilty O
? O

No O
one O
! O

Christ O
Jesus O
died O
for O
us O
, O
but O
that O
is O
not O
all O
. O

He O
was O
also O
raised O
from O
death O
. O

And O
now O
he O
is O
at O
God O
's O
right O
side O
, O
speaking O
to O
him O
for O
us O
. O

Can O
anything O
separate O
us O
from O
Christ O
's O
love O
? O

Can O
trouble O
or O
problems O
or O
persecution O
separate O
us O
from O
his O
love O
? O

If O
we O
have O
no O
food O
or O
clothes O
or O
face O
danger O
or O
even O
death O
, O
will O
that O
separate O
us O
from O
his O
love O
? O

As O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
For O
you O
we O
are O
in O
danger O
of O
death O
all O
the O
time O
. O

People O
think O
we O
are O
worth O
no O
more O
than O
sheep O
to O
be O
killed O
. O
'' O

But O
in O
all O
these O
troubles O
we O
have O
complete O
victory O
through O
God O
, O
who O
has O
shown O
his O
love O
for O
us O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
that O
nothing O
can O
separate O
us O
from O
God O
's O
love O
-- O
not O
death O
, O
life O
, O
angels O
, O
or O
ruling O
spirits O
. O

I O
am O
sure O
that O
nothing O
now O
, O
nothing O
in O
the O
future O
, O
no O
powers O
, O
nothing O
above O
us O
or O
nothing O
below O
us O
-- O
nothing O
in O
the O
whole O
created O
world O
-- O
will O
ever O
be O
able O
to O
separate O
us O
from O
the O
love O
God O
has O
shown O
us O
in O
Christ O
Jesus O
our O
Lord O
. O

So O
do O
you O
think O
that O
you O
can O
judge O
those O
other O
people O
? O

You O
are O
wrong O
. O

You O
too O
are O
guilty O
of O
sin O
. O

You O
judge O
them O
, O
but O
you O
do O
the O
same O
things O
they O
do O
. O

So O
when O
you O
judge O
them O
, O
you O
are O
really O
condemning O
yourself O
. O

God O
judges O
all O
who O
do O
such O
things O
, O
and O
we O
know O
his O
judgment O
is O
right O
. O

And O
since O
you O
do O
the O
same O
things O
as O
those O
people O
you O
judge O
, O
surely O
you O
understand O
that O
God O
will O
punish O
you O
too O
. O

How O
could O
you O
think O
you O
would O
be O
able O
to O
escape O
his O
judgment O
? O

God O
has O
been O
kind O
to O
you O
. O

He O
has O
been O
very O
patient O
, O
waiting O
for O
you O
to O
change O
. O

But O
you O
think O
nothing O
of O
his O
kindness O
. O

Maybe O
you O
do O
n't O
understand O
that O
God O
is O
kind O
to O
you O
so O
that O
you O
will O
decide O
to O
change O
your O
lives O
. O

But O
you O
are O
so O
stubborn O
! O

You O
refuse O
to O
change O
. O

So O
you O
are O
making O
your O
own O
punishment O
greater O
and O
greater O
. O

You O
will O
be O
punished O
on O
the O
day O
when O
God O
will O
show O
his O
anger O
. O

On O
that O
day O
everyone O
will O
see O
how O
right O
God O
is O
to O
judge O
people O
. O

He O
will O
reward O
or O
punish O
everyone O
for O
what O
they O
have O
done O
. O

Some O
people O
live O
for O
God O
's O
glory O
, O
for O
honor O
, O
and O
for O
life O
that O
can O
not O
be O
destroyed O
. O

They O
live O
for O
those O
things O
by O
always O
continuing O
to O
do O
good O
. O

God O
will O
give O
eternal O
life O
to O
them O
. O

But O
others O
are O
selfish O
and O
refuse O
to O
follow O
truth O
. O

They O
follow O
evil O
. O

God O
will O
show O
his O
anger O
and O
punish O
them O
. O

He O
will O
give O
trouble O
and O
suffering O
to O
everyone O
who O
does O
evil O
-- O
to O
the O
Jews O
first O
and O
also O
to O
those O
who O
are O
not O
Jews O
. O

But O
he O
will O
give O
glory O
, O
honor O
, O
and O
peace O
to O
everyone O
who O
does O
good O
-- O
to O
the O
Jews O
first O
and O
also O
to O
those O
who O
are O
not O
Jews O
. O

God O
judges O
everyone O
the O
same O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
matter O
who O
they O
are O
. O

People O
who O
have O
the O
law O
and O
those O
who O
have O
never O
heard O
of O
the O
law O
are O
all O
the O
same O
when O
they O
sin O
. O

People O
who O
do O
n't O
have O
the O
law O
and O
are O
sinners O
will O
be O
lost O
. O

And O
, O
in O
the O
same O
way O
, O
those O
who O
have O
the O
law O
and O
are O
sinners O
will O
be O
judged O
by O
the O
law O
. O

Hearing O
the O
law O
does O
not O
make O
people O
right O
with O
God O
. O

They O
will O
be O
right O
before O
him O
only O
if O
they O
always O
do O
what O
the O
law O
says O
. O

Those O
who O
are O
not O
Jews O
do O
n't O
have O
the O
law O
. O

But O
when O
they O
naturally O
do O
what O
the O
law O
commands O
without O
even O
knowing O
the O
law O
, O
then O
they O
are O
their O
own O
law O
. O

This O
is O
true O
even O
though O
they O
do O
n't O
have O
the O
written O
law O
. O

They O
show O
that O
in O
their O
hearts O
they O
know O
what O
is O
right O
and O
wrong O
, O
the O
same O
as O
the O
law O
commands O
, O
and O
their O
consciences O
agree O
. O

Sometimes O
their O
thoughts O
tell O
them O
that O
they O
have O
done O
wrong O
, O
and O
this O
makes O
them O
guilty O
. O

And O
sometimes O
their O
thoughts O
tell O
them O
that O
they O
have O
done O
right O
, O
and O
this O
makes O
them O
not O
guilty O
. O

All O
this O
will O
happen O
on O
the O
day O
when O
God O
will O
judge O
people O
's O
secret O
thoughts O
through O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

This O
is O
part O
of O
the O
Good O
News O
that O
I O
tell O
everyone O
. O

What O
about O
you O
? O

You O
say O
you O
are O
a O
Jew O
. O

You O
trust O
in O
the O
law O
and O
proudly O
claim O
to O
be O
close O
to O
God O
. O

You O
know O
what O
God O
wants O
you O
to O
do O
. O

And O
you O
know O
what O
is O
important O
, O
because O
you O
have O
learned O
the O
law O
. O

You O
think O
you O
are O
a O
guide O
for O
people O
who O
do O
n't O
know O
the O
right O
way O
, O
a O
light O
for O
those O
who O
are O
in O
the O
dark O
. O

You O
think O
you O
can O
show O
foolish O
people O
what O
is O
right O
. O

And O
you O
think O
you O
are O
a O
teacher O
for O
those O
who O
are O
just O
beginning O
to O
learn O
. O

You O
have O
the O
law O
, O
and O
so O
you O
think O
you O
know O
everything O
and O
have O
all O
truth O
. O

You O
teach O
others O
, O
so O
why O
do O
n't O
you O
teach O
yourself O
? O

You O
tell O
them O
not O
to O
steal O
, O
but O
you O
yourself O
steal O
. O

You O
say O
they O
must O
not O
commit O
adultery O
, O
but O
you O
yourself O
are O
guilty O
of O
that O
sin O
. O

You O
hate O
idols O
, O
but O
you O
steal O
them O
from O
their O
temples O
. O

You O
are O
so O
proud O
that O
you O
have O
God O
's O
law O
, O
but O
you O
bring O
shame O
to O
God O
by O
breaking O
his O
law O
. O

As O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
People O
in O
other O
nations O
insult O
God O
because O
of O
you O
. O
'' O

If O
you O
follow O
the O
law O
, O
then O
your O
circumcision O
has O
meaning O
. O

But O
if O
you O
break O
the O
law O
, O
then O
it O
is O
as O
if O
you O
were O
never O
circumcised O
. O

Those O
who O
are O
not O
Jews O
are O
not O
circumcised O
. O

But O
if O
they O
do O
what O
the O
law O
says O
, O
it O
is O
as O
if O
they O
were O
circumcised O
. O

You O
have O
the O
written O
law O
and O
circumcision O
, O
but O
you O
break O
the O
law O
. O

So O
those O
who O
are O
not O
circumcised O
in O
their O
bodies O
, O
but O
still O
obey O
the O
law O
, O
will O
show O
that O
you O
are O
guilty O
. O

You O
are O
not O
a O
true O
Jew O
if O
you O
are O
only O
a O
Jew O
in O
your O
physical O
body O
. O

True O
circumcision O
is O
not O
only O
on O
the O
outside O
of O
the O
body O
. O

A O
true O
Jew O
is O
one O
who O
is O
a O
Jew O
inside O
. O

True O
circumcision O
is O
done O
in O
the O
heart O
. O

It O
is O
done O
by O
the O
Spirit O
, O
not O
by O
the O
written O
law O
. O

And O
anyone O
who O
is O
circumcised O
in O
the O
heart O
by O
the O
Spirit O
gets O
praise O
from O
God O
, O
not O
from O
people O
. O

We O
have O
been O
made O
right O
with O
God O
because O
of O
our O
faith O
. O

So O
we O
have O
peace O
with O
God O
through O
our O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

Through O
our O
faith O
, O
Christ O
has O
brought O
us O
into O
that O
blessing O
of O
God O
's O
grace O
that O
we O
now O
enjoy O
. O

And O
we O
are O
very O
happy O
because O
of O
the O
hope O
we O
have O
of O
sharing O
God O
's O
glory O
. O

And O
we O
are O
also O
happy O
with O
the O
troubles O
we O
have O
. O

Why O
are O
we O
happy O
with O
troubles O
? O

Because O
we O
know O
that O
these O
troubles O
make O
us O
more O
patient O
. O

And O
this O
patience O
is O
proof O
that O
we O
are O
strong O
. O

And O
this O
proof O
gives O
us O
hope O
. O

And O
this O
hope O
will O
never O
disappoint O
us O
. O

We O
know O
this O
because O
God O
has O
poured O
out O
his O
love O
to O
fill O
our O
hearts O
through O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
he O
gave O
us O
. O

Christ O
died O
for O
us O
when O
we O
were O
unable O
to O
help O
ourselves O
. O

We O
were O
living O
against O
God O
, O
but O
at O
just O
the O
right O
time O
Christ O
died O
for O
us O
. O

Very O
few O
people O
will O
die O
to O
save O
the O
life O
of O
someone O
else O
, O
even O
if O
it O
is O
for O
a O
good O
person O
. O

Someone O
might O
be O
willing O
to O
die O
for O
an O
especially O
good O
person O
. O

But O
Christ O
died O
for O
us O
while O
we O
were O
still O
sinners O
, O
and O
by O
this O
God O
showed O
how O
much O
he O
loves O
us O
. O

We O
have O
been O
made O
right O
with O
God O
by O
the O
blood O
sacrifice O
of O
Christ O
. O

So O
through O
Christ O
we O
will O
surely O
be O
saved O
from O
God O
's O
anger O
. O

I O
mean O
that O
while O
we O
were O
God O
's O
enemies O
, O
he O
made O
friends O
with O
us O
through O
his O
Son O
's O
death O
. O

And O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
are O
now O
God O
's O
friends O
makes O
it O
even O
more O
certain O
that O
he O
will O
save O
us O
through O
his O
Son O
's O
life O
. O

And O
not O
only O
will O
we O
be O
saved O
, O
but O
we O
also O
rejoice O
right O
now O
in O
what O
God O
has O
done O
for O
us O
through O
our O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

It O
is O
because O
of O
Jesus O
that O
we O
are O
now O
God O
's O
friends O
. O

Sin O
came O
into O
the O
world O
because O
of O
what O
one O
man O
did O
. O

And O
with O
sin O
came O
death O
. O

So O
this O
is O
why O
all O
people O
must O
die O
-- O
because O
all O
people O
have O
sinned O
. O

Sin O
was O
in O
the O
world O
before O
the O
Law O
of O
Moses O
. O

But O
God O
does O
not O
consider O
people O
guilty O
of O
sin O
if O
there O
is O
no O
law O
. O

But O
from O
the O
time O
of O
Adam O
to O
the O
time O
of O
Moses O
, O
everyone O
had O
to O
die O
. O

Adam O
died O
because O
he O
sinned O
by O
not O
obeying O
God O
's O
command O
. O

But O
even O
those O
who O
did O
not O
sin O
that O
same O
way O
had O
to O
die O
. O

That O
one O
man O
, O
Adam O
, O
can O
be O
compared O
to O
Christ O
, O
the O
one O
who O
was O
coming O
in O
the O
future O
. O

But O
God O
's O
free O
gift O
is O
not O
like O
Adam O
's O
sin O
. O

Many O
people O
died O
because O
of O
the O
sin O
of O
that O
one O
man O
. O

But O
the O
grace O
that O
people O
received O
from O
God O
was O
much O
greater O
. O

Many O
received O
God O
's O
gift O
of O
life O
by O
the O
grace O
of O
this O
other O
man O
, O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

After O
Adam O
sinned O
once O
, O
he O
was O
judged O
guilty O
. O

But O
the O
gift O
of O
God O
is O
different O
. O

His O
free O
gift O
came O
after O
many O
sins O
, O
and O
it O
makes O
people O
right O
with O
him O
. O

One O
man O
sinned O
, O
and O
so O
death O
ruled O
all O
people O
because O
of O
that O
one O
man O
. O

But O
now O
some O
people O
accept O
God O
's O
full O
grace O
and O
his O
great O
gift O
of O
being O
made O
right O
. O

Surely O
they O
will O
have O
true O
life O
and O
rule O
through O
the O
one O
man O
, O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

So O
that O
one O
sin O
of O
Adam O
brought O
the O
punishment O
of O
death O
to O
all O
people O
. O

But O
in O
the O
same O
way O
, O
Christ O
did O
something O
so O
good O
that O
it O
makes O
all O
people O
right O
with O
God O
. O

And O
that O
brings O
them O
true O
life O
. O

One O
man O
disobeyed O
God O
and O
many O
became O
sinners O
. O

But O
in O
the O
same O
way O
, O
one O
man O
obeyed O
God O
and O
many O
will O
be O
made O
right O
. O

The O
law O
was O
brought O
in O
so O
that O
more O
people O
would O
sin O
the O
way O
Adam O
did O
. O

But O
where O
sin O
increased O
, O
there O
was O
even O
more O
of O
God O
's O
grace O
. O

Sin O
once O
used O
death O
to O
rule O
us O
. O

But O
God O
gave O
us O
more O
of O
his O
grace O
so O
that O
grace O
could O
rule O
by O
making O
us O
right O
with O
him O
. O

And O
this O
brings O
us O
eternal O
life O
through O
Jesus O
Christ O
our O
Lord O
. O

So O
what O
can O
we O
say O
about O
Abraham O
, O
the O
father O
of O
our O
people O
? O

What O
did O
he O
learn O
about O
faith O
? O

If O
Abraham O
was O
made O
right O
by O
the O
things O
he O
did O
, O
he O
had O
a O
reason O
to O
boast O
about O
himself O
. O

But O
God O
knew O
different O
. O

That O
's O
why O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
Abraham O
believed O
God O
, O
and O
because O
of O
this O
he O
was O
accepted O
as O
one O
who O
is O
right O
with O
God O
. O
'' O

When O
people O
work O
, O
their O
pay O
is O
not O
given O
to O
them O
as O
a O
gift O
. O

They O
earn O
the O
pay O
they O
get O
. O

But O
people O
can O
not O
do O
any O
work O
that O
will O
make O
them O
right O
with O
God O
. O

So O
they O
must O
trust O
in O
him O
. O

Then O
he O
accepts O
their O
faith O
, O
and O
that O
makes O
them O
right O
with O
him O
. O

He O
is O
the O
one O
who O
makes O
even O
evil O
people O
right O
. O

David O
said O
the O
same O
thing O
when O
he O
was O
talking O
about O
the O
blessing O
people O
have O
when O
God O
accepts O
them O
as O
good O
without O
looking O
at O
what O
they O
have O
done O
: O
`` O
It O
is O
a O
great O
blessing O
when O
people O
are O
forgiven O
for O
the O
wrongs O
they O
have O
done O
, O
when O
their O
sins O
are O
erased O
! O

It O
is O
a O
great O
blessing O
when O
the O
Lord O
accepts O
people O
as O
if O
they O
are O
without O
sin O
! O
'' O

Is O
this O
blessing O
only O
for O
those O
who O
are O
circumcised O
? O

Or O
is O
it O
also O
for O
those O
who O
are O
not O
circumcised O
? O

We O
have O
already O
said O
that O
it O
was O
because O
of O
Abraham O
's O
faith O
that O
he O
was O
accepted O
as O
one O
who O
is O
right O
with O
God O
. O

So O
how O
did O
this O
happen O
? O

Did O
God O
accept O
Abraham O
before O
or O
after O
he O
was O
circumcised O
? O

God O
accepted O
him O
before O
his O
circumcision O
. O

Abraham O
was O
circumcised O
later O
to O
show O
that O
God O
accepted O
him O
. O

His O
circumcision O
was O
proof O
that O
he O
was O
right O
with O
God O
through O
faith O
before O
he O
was O
circumcised O
. O

So O
Abraham O
is O
the O
father O
of O
all O
those O
who O
believe O
but O
are O
not O
circumcised O
. O

They O
believe O
and O
are O
accepted O
as O
people O
who O
are O
right O
with O
God O
. O

And O
Abraham O
is O
also O
the O
father O
of O
those O
who O
have O
been O
circumcised O
. O

But O
it O
is O
not O
their O
circumcision O
that O
makes O
him O
their O
father O
. O

He O
is O
their O
father O
only O
if O
they O
live O
following O
the O
faith O
that O
our O
father O
Abraham O
had O
before O
he O
was O
circumcised O
. O

Abraham O
and O
his O
descendants O
received O
the O
promise O
that O
they O
would O
get O
the O
whole O
world O
. O

But O
Abraham O
did O
not O
receive O
that O
promise O
because O
he O
followed O
the O
law O
. O

He O
received O
that O
promise O
because O
he O
was O
right O
with O
God O
through O
his O
faith O
. O

If O
people O
could O
get O
God O
's O
promise O
by O
following O
the O
law O
, O
then O
faith O
is O
worthless O
. O

And O
God O
's O
promise O
to O
Abraham O
is O
worthless O
, O
because O
the O
law O
can O
only O
bring O
God O
's O
anger O
on O
those O
who O
disobey O
it O
. O

But O
if O
there O
is O
no O
law O
, O
then O
there O
is O
nothing O
to O
disobey O
. O

So O
people O
get O
what O
God O
promised O
by O
having O
faith O
. O

This O
happens O
so O
that O
the O
promise O
can O
be O
a O
free O
gift O
. O

And O
if O
the O
promise O
is O
a O
free O
gift O
, O
then O
all O
of O
Abraham O
's O
people O
will O
get O
that O
promise O
. O

The O
promise O
is O
not O
just O
for O
those O
who O
live O
under O
the O
Law O
of O
Moses O
. O

It O
is O
for O
all O
who O
live O
with O
faith O
as O
Abraham O
did O
. O

He O
is O
the O
father O
of O
us O
all O
. O

As O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
I O
have O
made O
you O
a O
father O
of O
many O
nations O
. O
'' O

This O
is O
true O
before O
God O
, O
the O
one O
Abraham O
believed O
-- O
the O
God O
who O
gives O
life O
to O
the O
dead O
and O
speaks O
of O
things O
that O
do O
n't O
yet O
exist O
as O
if O
they O
are O
real O
. O

There O
was O
no O
hope O
that O
Abraham O
would O
have O
children O
, O
but O
Abraham O
believed O
God O
and O
continued O
to O
hope O
. O

And O
that O
is O
why O
he O
became O
the O
father O
of O
many O
nations O
. O

As O
God O
told O
him O
, O
`` O
You O
will O
have O
many O
descendants O
. O
'' O

Abraham O
was O
almost O
a O
hundred O
years O
old O
, O
so O
he O
was O
past O
the O
age O
for O
having O
children O
. O

Also O
, O
Sarah O
could O
not O
have O
children O
. O

Abraham O
was O
well O
aware O
of O
this O
, O
but O
his O
faith O
in O
God O
never O
became O
weak O
. O

He O
never O
doubted O
that O
God O
would O
do O
what O
he O
promised O
. O

He O
never O
stopped O
believing O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
he O
grew O
stronger O
in O
his O
faith O
and O
just O
praised O
God O
. O

Abraham O
felt O
sure O
that O
God O
was O
able O
to O
do O
what O
he O
promised O
. O

So O
that O
's O
why O
`` O
he O
was O
accepted O
as O
one O
who O
is O
right O
with O
God O
. O
'' O

These O
words O
-LRB- O
`` O
he O
was O
accepted O
'' O
-RRB- O
were O
written O
not O
only O
for O
Abraham O
. O

They O
were O
also O
written O
for O
us O
. O

God O
will O
also O
accept O
us O
because O
we O
believe O
. O

We O
believe O
in O
the O
one O
who O
raised O
Jesus O
our O
Lord O
from O
death O
. O

Jesus O
was O
handed O
over O
to O
die O
for O
our O
sins O
, O
and O
he O
was O
raised O
from O
death O
to O
make O
us O
right O
with O
God O
. O

Greetings O

of O

to O

an O
apostle O

is O
about O
God O
's O
Son O
, O
Jesus O
Christ O
our O
Lord O
. O

As O
a O
human O
, O
he O
was O
born O
from O
the O
family O
of O
David O
, O
but O
through O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
he O
was O
shown O
to O
be O
God O
's O
powerful O
Son O
when O
he O
was O
raised O
from O
death O
. O

Through O
Christ O
, O
God O
gave O
me O
the O
special O
work O
of O
an O
apostle O
-- O
to O
lead O
people O
of O
all O
nations O
to O
believe O
and O
obey O
him O
. O

I O
do O
all O
this O
to O
honor O
Christ O
. O

You O
are O
some O
of O
those O
who O
have O
been O
chosen O
to O
belong O
to O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

This O
letter O
is O
to O
all O
of O
you O
in O
Rome O
. O

God O
loves O
you O
, O
and O
he O
has O
chosen O
you O
to O
be O
his O
holy O
people O
. O

Grace O
and O
peace O
to O
you O
from O
God O
our O
Father O
and O
from O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

First O
I O
want O
to O
say O
that O
I O
thank O
my O
God O
through O
Jesus O
Christ O
for O
all O
of O
you O
. O

I O
thank O
him O
because O
people O
everywhere O
in O
the O
world O
are O
talking O
about O
your O
great O
faith O
. O

Every O
time O
I O
pray O
, O
I O
always O
remember O
you O
. O

God O
knows O
this O
is O
true O
. O

He O
is O
the O
one O
I O
serve O
with O
all O
my O
heart O
by O
telling O
people O
the O
Good O
News O
about O
his O
Son O
. O

I O
pray O
that O
I O
will O
be O
allowed O
to O
come O
to O
you O
. O

It O
will O
happen O
if O
God O
wants O
it O
. O

I O
want O
very O
much O
to O
see O
you O
and O
give O
you O
some O
spiritual O
gift O
to O
make O
your O
faith O
stronger O
. O

I O
mean O
that O
I O
want O
us O
to O
help O
each O
other O
with O
the O
faith O
that O
we O
have O
. O

Your O
faith O
will O
help O
me O
, O
and O
my O
faith O
will O
help O
you O
. O

Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
I O
want O
you O
to O
know O
that O
I O
have O
planned O
many O
times O
to O
come O
to O
you O
, O
but O
something O
always O
happens O
to O
change O
my O
plans O
. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
see O
the O
same O
good O
result O
among O
you O
that O
I O
have O
had O
from O
my O
work O
among O
the O
other O
non-Jewish O
people O
. O

I O
must O
serve O
all O
people O
-- O
those O
who O
share O
in O
Greek O
culture O
and O
those O
who O
are O
less O
civilized O
, O
the O
educated O
as O
well O
as O
the O
ignorant O
. O

That O
is O
why O
I O
want O
so O
much O
to O
tell O
the O
Good O
News O
to O
you O
there O
in O
Rome O
. O

I O
am O
proud O
of O
the O
Good O
News O
, O
because O
it O
is O
the O
power O
God O
uses O
to O
save O
everyone O
who O
believes O
-- O
to O
save O
the O
Jews O
first O
, O
and O
now O
to O
save O
those O
who O
are O
not O
Jews O
. O

The O
Good O
News O
shows O
how O
God O
makes O
people O
right O
with O
himself O
. O

God O
's O
way O
of O
making O
people O
right O
begins O
and O
ends O
with O
faith O
. O

As O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
The O
one O
who O
is O
right O
with O
God O
by O
faith O
will O
live O
forever O
. O
'' O

God O
shows O
his O
anger O
from O
heaven O
against O
all O
the O
evil O
and O
wrong O
things O
that O
people O
do O
. O

Their O
evil O
lives O
hide O
the O
truth O
they O
have O
. O

This O
makes O
God O
angry O
because O
they O
have O
been O
shown O
what O
he O
is O
like O
. O

Yes O
, O
God O
has O
made O
it O
clear O
to O
them O
. O

There O
are O
things O
about O
God O
that O
people O
can O
not O
see O
-- O
his O
eternal O
power O
and O
all O
that O
makes O
him O
God O
. O

But O
since O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
world O
, O
those O
things O
have O
been O
easy O
for O
people O
to O
understand O
. O

They O
are O
made O
clear O
in O
what O
God O
has O
made O
. O

So O
people O
have O
no O
excuse O
for O
the O
evil O
they O
do O
. O

People O
knew O
God O
, O
but O
they O
did O
not O
honor O
him O
as O
God O
, O
and O
they O
did O
not O
thank O
him O
. O

Their O
ideas O
were O
all O
useless O
. O

There O
was O
not O
one O
good O
thought O
left O
in O
their O
foolish O
minds O
. O

They O
said O
they O
were O
wise O
, O
but O
they O
became O
fools O
. O

Instead O
of O
honoring O
the O
divine O
greatness O
of O
God O
, O
who O
lives O
forever O
, O
they O
traded O
it O
for O
the O
worship O
of O
idols O
-- O
things O
made O
to O
look O
like O
humans O
, O
who O
get O
sick O
and O
die O
, O
or O
like O
birds O
, O
animals O
, O
and O
snakes O
. O

People O
wanted O
only O
to O
do O
evil O
. O

So O
God O
left O
them O
and O
let O
them O
go O
their O
sinful O
way O
. O

And O
so O
they O
became O
completely O
immoral O
and O
used O
their O
bodies O
in O
shameful O
ways O
with O
each O
other O
. O

They O
traded O
the O
truth O
of O
God O
for O
a O
lie O
. O

They O
bowed O
down O
and O
worshiped O
the O
things O
God O
made O
instead O
of O
worshiping O
the O
God O
who O
made O
those O
things O
. O

He O
is O
the O
one O
who O
should O
be O
praised O
forever O
. O

Amen O
. O

Because O
people O
did O
those O
things O
, O
God O
left O
them O
and O
let O
them O
do O
the O
shameful O
things O
they O
wanted O
to O
do O
. O

Women O
stopped O
having O
natural O
sex O
with O
men O
and O
started O
having O
sex O
with O
other O
women O
. O

In O
the O
same O
way O
, O
men O
stopped O
having O
natural O
sex O
with O
women O
and O
began O
wanting O
each O
other O
all O
the O
time O
. O

Men O
did O
shameful O
things O
with O
other O
men O
, O
and O
in O
their O
bodies O
they O
received O
the O
punishment O
for O
those O
wrongs O
. O

People O
did O
not O
think O
it O
was O
important O
to O
have O
a O
true O
knowledge O
of O
God O
. O

So O
God O
left O
them O
and O
allowed O
them O
to O
have O
their O
own O
worthless O
thinking O
. O

And O
so O
they O
do O
what O
they O
should O
not O
do O
. O

They O
are O
filled O
with O
every O
kind O
of O
sin O
, O
evil O
, O
greed O
, O
and O
hatred O
. O

They O
are O
full O
of O
jealousy O
, O
murder O
, O
fighting O
, O
lying O
, O
and O
thinking O
the O
worst O
things O
about O
each O
other O
. O

They O
gossip O
and O
say O
evil O
things O
about O
each O
other O
. O

They O
hate O
God O
. O

They O
are O
rude O
, O
proud O
, O
and O
brag O
about O
themselves O
. O

They O
invent O
ways O
of O
doing O
evil O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
obey O
their O
parents O
, O
they O
are O
foolish O
, O
they O
do O
n't O
keep O
their O
promises O
, O
and O
they O
show O
no O
kindness O
or O
mercy O
to O
others O
. O

They O
know O
God O
's O
law O
says O
that O
anyone O
who O
lives O
like O
that O
should O
die O
. O

But O
they O
not O
only O
continue O
to O
do O
these O
things O
themselves O
, O
but O
they O
also O
encourage O
others O
who O
do O
them O
. O

So O
I O
beg O
you O
, O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
because O
of O
the O
great O
mercy O
God O
has O
shown O
us O
, O
offer O
your O
lives O
as O
a O
living O
sacrifice O
to O
him O
-- O
an O
offering O
that O
is O
only O
for O
God O
and O
pleasing O
to O
him O
. O

Considering O
what O
he O
has O
done O
, O
it O
is O
only O
right O
that O
you O
should O
worship O
him O
in O
this O
way O
. O

Do O
n't O
change O
yourselves O
to O
be O
like O
the O
people O
of O
this O
world O
, O
but O
let O
God O
change O
you O
inside O
with O
a O
new O
way O
of O
thinking O
. O

Then O
you O
will O
be O
able O
to O
understand O
and O
accept O
what O
God O
wants O
for O
you O
. O

You O
will O
be O
able O
to O
know O
what O
is O
good O
and O
pleasing O
to O
him O
and O
what O
is O
perfect O
. O

God O
has O
given O
me O
a O
special O
gift O
, O
and O
that O
is O
why O
I O
have O
something O
to O
say O
to O
each O
one O
of O
you O
. O

Do O
n't O
think O
that O
you O
are O
better O
than O
you O
really O
are O
. O

You O
must O
see O
yourself O
just O
as O
you O
are O
. O

Decide O
what O
you O
are O
by O
the O
faith O
God O
has O
given O
each O
of O
us O
. O

Each O
one O
of O
us O
has O
one O
body O
, O
and O
that O
body O
has O
many O
parts O
. O

These O
parts O
do O
n't O
all O
do O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

In O
the O
same O
way O
, O
we O
are O
many O
people O
, O
but O
in O
Christ O
we O
are O
all O
one O
body O
. O

We O
are O
the O
parts O
of O
that O
body O
, O
and O
each O
part O
belongs O
to O
all O
the O
others O
. O

We O
all O
have O
different O
gifts O
. O

Each O
gift O
came O
because O
of O
the O
grace O
God O
gave O
us O
. O

Whoever O
has O
the O
gift O
of O
prophecy O
should O
use O
that O
gift O
in O
a O
way O
that O
fits O
the O
kind O
of O
faith O
they O
have O
. O

Whoever O
has O
the O
gift O
of O
serving O
should O
serve O
. O

Whoever O
has O
the O
gift O
of O
teaching O
should O
teach O
. O

Whoever O
has O
the O
gift O
of O
comforting O
others O
should O
do O
that O
. O

Whoever O
has O
the O
gift O
of O
giving O
to O
help O
others O
should O
give O
generously O
. O

Whoever O
has O
the O
gift O
of O
leading O
should O
work O
hard O
at O
it O
. O

Whoever O
has O
the O
gift O
of O
showing O
kindness O
to O
others O
should O
do O
it O
gladly O
. O

Your O
love O
must O
be O
real O
. O

Hate O
what O
is O
evil O
. O

Do O
only O
what O
is O
good O
. O

Love O
each O
other O
in O
a O
way O
that O
makes O
you O
feel O
close O
like O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
. O

And O
give O
each O
other O
more O
honor O
than O
you O
give O
yourself O
. O

As O
you O
serve O
the O
Lord O
, O
work O
hard O
and O
do O
n't O
be O
lazy O
. O

Be O
excited O
about O
serving O
him O
! O

Be O
happy O
because O
of O
the O
hope O
you O
have O
. O

Be O
patient O
when O
you O
have O
troubles O
. O

Pray O
all O
the O
time O
. O

Share O
with O
God O
's O
people O
who O
need O
help O
. O

Look O
for O
people O
who O
need O
help O
and O
welcome O
them O
into O
your O
homes O
. O

Wish O
only O
good O
for O
those O
who O
treat O
you O
badly O
. O

Ask O
God O
to O
bless O
them O
, O
not O
curse O
them O
. O

When O
others O
are O
happy O
, O
you O
should O
be O
happy O
with O
them O
. O

And O
when O
others O
are O
sad O
, O
you O
should O
be O
sad O
too O
. O

Live O
together O
in O
peace O
with O
each O
other O
. O

Do O
n't O
be O
proud O
, O
but O
be O
willing O
to O
be O
friends O
with O
people O
who O
are O
not O
important O
to O
others O
. O

Do O
n't O
think O
of O
yourself O
as O
smarter O
than O
everyone O
else O
. O

If O
someone O
does O
you O
wrong O
, O
do O
n't O
try O
to O
pay O
them O
back O
by O
hurting O
them O
. O

Try O
to O
do O
what O
everyone O
thinks O
is O
right O
. O

Do O
the O
best O
you O
can O
to O
live O
in O
peace O
with O
everyone O
. O

My O
friends O
, O
do O
n't O
try O
to O
punish O
anyone O
who O
does O
wrong O
to O
you O
. O

Wait O
for O
God O
to O
punish O
them O
with O
his O
anger O
. O

It O
is O
written O
: O
`` O
I O
am O
the O
one O
who O
punishes O
; O
I O
will O
pay O
people O
back O
, O
'' O
says O
the O
Lord O
. O

But O
you O
should O
do O
this O
: O
`` O
If O
you O
have O
enemies O
who O
are O
hungry O
, O
give O
them O
something O
to O
eat O
. O

If O
you O
have O
enemies O
who O
are O
thirsty O
, O
give O
them O
something O
to O
drink O
. O

In O
doing O
this O
you O
will O
make O
them O
feel O
ashamed O
. O
'' O

Do O
n't O
let O
evil O
defeat O
you O
, O
but O
defeat O
evil O
by O
doing O
good O
. O

All O
of O
you O
must O
obey O
the O
government O
rulers O
. O

Everyone O
who O
rules O
was O
given O
the O
power O
to O
rule O
by O
God O
. O

And O
all O
those O
who O
rule O
now O
were O
given O
that O
power O
by O
God O
. O

So O
anyone O
who O
is O
against O
the O
government O
is O
really O
against O
something O
God O
has O
commanded O
. O

Those O
who O
are O
against O
the O
government O
bring O
punishment O
on O
themselves O
. O

People O
who O
do O
right O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
fear O
the O
rulers O
. O

But O
those O
who O
do O
wrong O
must O
fear O
them O
. O

Do O
you O
want O
to O
be O
free O
from O
fearing O
them O
? O

Then O
do O
only O
what O
is O
right O
, O
and O
they O
will O
praise O
you O
. O

Rulers O
are O
God O
's O
servants O
to O
help O
you O
. O

But O
if O
you O
do O
wrong O
, O
you O
have O
reason O
to O
be O
afraid O
. O

They O
have O
the O
power O
to O
punish O
, O
and O
they O
will O
use O
it O
. O

They O
are O
God O
's O
servants O
to O
punish O
those O
who O
do O
wrong O
. O

So O
you O
must O
obey O
the O
government O
, O
not O
just O
because O
you O
might O
be O
punished O
, O
but O
because O
you O
know O
it O
is O
the O
right O
thing O
to O
do O
. O

And O
this O
is O
why O
you O
pay O
taxes O
too O
. O

Those O
rulers O
are O
working O
for O
God O
, O
and O
they O
give O
all O
their O
time O
to O
the O
work O
of O
ruling O
. O

Give O
everyone O
what O
you O
owe O
them O
. O

If O
you O
owe O
them O
any O
kind O
of O
tax O
, O
then O
pay O
it O
. O

Show O
respect O
to O
those O
you O
should O
respect O
. O

And O
show O
honor O
to O
those O
you O
should O
honor O
. O

You O
should O
owe O
nothing O
to O
anyone O
, O
except O
that O
you O
will O
always O
owe O
love O
to O
each O
other O
. O

The O
person O
who O
loves O
others O
has O
done O
all O
that O
the O
law O
commands O
. O

The O
law O
says O
, O
`` O
You O
must O
not O
commit O
adultery O
, O
you O
must O
not O
murder O
anyone O
, O
you O
must O
not O
steal O
, O
you O
must O
not O
want O
what O
belongs O
to O
someone O
else O
. O
'' O

All O
these O
commands O
and O
all O
other O
commands O
are O
really O
only O
one O
rule O
: O

`` O
Love O
your O
neighbor O
the O
same O
as O
you O
love O
yourself O
. O
'' O

Love O
does O
n't O
hurt O
others O
. O

So O
loving O
is O
the O
same O
as O
obeying O
all O
the O
law O
. O

I O
say O
this O
because O
you O
know O
that O
we O
live O
in O
an O
important O
time O
. O

Yes O
, O
it O
is O
now O
time O
for O
you O
to O
wake O
up O
from O
your O
sleep O
. O

Our O
salvation O
is O
nearer O
now O
than O
when O
we O
first O
believed O
. O

The O
night O
is O
almost O
finished O
. O

The O
day O
is O
almost O
here O
. O

So O
we O
should O
stop O
doing O
whatever O
belongs O
to O
darkness O
. O

We O
should O
prepare O
ourselves O
to O
fight O
evil O
with O
the O
weapons O
that O
belong O
to O
the O
light O
. O

We O
should O
live O
in O
a O
right O
way O
, O
like O
people O
who O
belong O
to O
the O
day O
. O

We O
should O
not O
have O
wild O
parties O
or O
be O
drunk O
. O

We O
should O
not O
be O
involved O
in O
sexual O
sin O
or O
any O
kind O
of O
immoral O
behavior O
. O

We O
should O
not O
cause O
arguments O
and O
trouble O
or O
be O
jealous O
. O

But O
be O
like O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
, O
so O
that O
when O
people O
see O
what O
you O
do O
, O
they O
will O
see O
Christ O
. O

Do O
n't O
think O
about O
how O
to O
satisfy O
the O
desires O
of O
your O
sinful O
self O
. O

Be O
willing O
to O
accept O
those O
who O
still O
have O
doubts O
about O
what O
believers O
can O
do O
. O

And O
do O
n't O
argue O
with O
them O
about O
their O
different O
ideas O
. O

Some O
people O
believe O
they O
can O
eat O
any O
kind O
of O
food O
, O
but O
those O
who O
have O
doubts O
eat O
only O
vegetables O
. O

Those O
who O
know O
they O
can O
eat O
any O
kind O
of O
food O
must O
not O
feel O
that O
they O
are O
better O
than O
those O
who O
eat O
only O
vegetables O
. O

And O
those O
who O
eat O
only O
vegetables O
must O
not O
decide O
that O
those O
who O
eat O
all O
foods O
are O
wrong O
. O

God O
has O
accepted O
them O
. O

You O
can O
not O
judge O
the O
servants O
of O
someone O
else O
. O

Their O
own O
master O
decides O
if O
they O
are O
doing O
right O
or O
wrong O
. O

And O
the O
Lord O
's O
servants O
will O
be O
right O
, O
because O
the O
Lord O
is O
able O
to O
make O
them O
right O
. O

Some O
people O
might O
believe O
that O
one O
day O
is O
more O
important O
than O
another O
. O

And O
others O
might O
believe O
that O
every O
day O
is O
the O
same O
. O

Everyone O
should O
be O
sure O
about O
their O
beliefs O
in O
their O
own O
mind O
. O

Those O
who O
think O
one O
day O
is O
more O
important O
than O
other O
days O
are O
doing O
that O
for O
the O
Lord O
. O

And O
those O
who O
eat O
all O
kinds O
of O
food O
are O
doing O
that O
for O
the O
Lord O
. O

Yes O
, O
they O
give O
thanks O
to O
God O
for O
that O
food O
. O

And O
those O
who O
refuse O
to O
eat O
some O
foods O
do O
that O
for O
the O
Lord O
. O

They O
also O
give O
thanks O
to O
God O
. O

We O
do O
n't O
live O
or O
die O
just O
for O
ourselves O
. O

If O
we O
live O
, O
we O
are O
living O
for O
the O
Lord O
. O

And O
if O
we O
die O
, O
we O
are O
dying O
for O
the O
Lord O
. O

So O
living O
or O
dying O
, O
we O
belong O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

That O
is O
why O
Christ O
died O
and O
rose O
from O
death O
to O
live O
again O
-- O
so O
that O
he O
could O
be O
Lord O
over O
those O
who O
have O
died O
and O
those O
who O
are O
living O
. O

So O
why O
do O
you O
judge O
your O
brother O
or O
sister O
in O
Christ O
? O

Or O
why O
do O
you O
think O
that O
you O
are O
better O
than O
they O
are O
? O

We O
will O
all O
stand O
before O
God O
, O
and O
he O
will O
judge O
us O
all O
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
' O
As O
surely O
as O
I O
live O
, O
' O
says O
the O
Lord O
, O
' O
Everyone O
will O
bow O
before O
me O
; O
everyone O
will O
say O
that O
I O
am O
God O
. O
' O
'' O

So O
each O
of O
us O
will O
have O
to O
explain O
to O
God O
about O
the O
things O
we O
do O
. O

So O
we O
should O
stop O
judging O
each O
other O
. O

Let O
's O
decide O
not O
to O
do O
anything O
that O
will O
cause O
a O
problem O
for O
a O
brother O
or O
sister O
or O
hurt O
their O
faith O
. O

I O
know O
that O
there O
is O
no O
food O
that O
is O
wrong O
to O
eat O
. O

The O
Lord O
Jesus O
is O
the O
one O
who O
convinced O
me O
of O
that O
. O

But O
if O
someone O
believes O
that O
something O
is O
wrong O
, O
then O
it O
is O
wrong O
for O
that O
person O
. O

If O
you O
hurt O
the O
faith O
of O
your O
brother O
or O
sister O
because O
of O
something O
you O
eat O
, O
you O
are O
not O
really O
following O
the O
way O
of O
love O
. O

Do O
n't O
destroy O
anyone O
's O
faith O
by O
eating O
something O
they O
think O
is O
wrong O
. O

Christ O
died O
for O
them O
. O

Do O
n't O
allow O
what O
is O
good O
for O
you O
to O
become O
something O
they O
say O
is O
evil O
. O

In O
God O
's O
kingdom O
, O
what O
we O
eat O
and O
drink O
is O
not O
important O
. O

Here O
is O
what O
is O
important O
: O
a O
right O
way O
of O
life O
, O
peace O
, O
and O
joy O
-- O
all O
from O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
. O

Whoever O
serves O
Christ O
by O
living O
this O
way O
is O
pleasing O
God O
, O
and O
they O
will O
be O
accepted O
by O
others O
. O

So O
let O
's O
try O
as O
hard O
as O
we O
can O
to O
do O
what O
will O
bring O
peace O
. O

Let O
's O
do O
whatever O
will O
help O
each O
other O
grow O
stronger O
in O
faith O
. O

Do O
n't O
let O
the O
eating O
of O
food O
destroy O
the O
work O
of O
God O
. O

All O
food O
is O
right O
to O
eat O
, O
but O
it O
is O
wrong O
for O
anyone O
to O
eat O
something O
that O
hurts O
the O
faith O
of O
another O
person O
. O

It O
is O
better O
not O
to O
eat O
meat O
or O
drink O
wine O
or O
do O
anything O
else O
that O
hurts O
the O
faith O
of O
your O
brother O
or O
sister O
. O

You O
should O
keep O
your O
beliefs O
about O
these O
things O
a O
secret O
between O
yourself O
and O
God O
. O

It O
is O
a O
blessing O
to O
be O
able O
to O
do O
what O
you O
think O
is O
right O
without O
feeling O
guilty O
. O

But O
anyone O
who O
eats O
something O
without O
being O
sure O
it O
is O
right O
is O
doing O
wrong O
. O

That O
is O
because O
they O
did O
not O
believe O
it O
was O
right O
. O

And O
if O
you O
do O
anything O
that O
you O
believe O
is O
not O
right O
, O
it O
is O
sin O
. O

Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
you O
all O
understand O
the O
Law O
of O
Moses O
. O

So O
surely O
you O
know O
that O
the O
law O
rules O
over O
people O
only O
while O
they O
are O
alive O
. O

It O
's O
like O
what O
the O
law O
says O
about O
marriage O
: O
A O
woman O
must O
stay O
married O
to O
her O
husband O
as O
long O
as O
he O
is O
alive O
. O

But O
if O
her O
husband O
dies O
, O
she O
is O
made O
free O
from O
the O
law O
of O
marriage O
. O

But O
if O
she O
marries O
another O
man O
while O
her O
husband O
is O
still O
alive O
, O
the O
law O
says O
she O
is O
guilty O
of O
adultery O
. O

But O
if O
her O
husband O
dies O
, O
she O
is O
made O
free O
from O
the O
law O
of O
marriage O
. O

So O
if O
she O
marries O
another O
man O
after O
her O
husband O
dies O
, O
she O
is O
not O
guilty O
of O
adultery O
. O

In O
the O
same O
way O
, O
my O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
your O
old O
selves O
died O
and O
you O
became O
free O
from O
the O
law O
through O
the O
body O
of O
Christ O
. O

Now O
you O
belong O
to O
someone O
else O
. O

You O
belong O
to O
the O
one O
who O
was O
raised O
from O
death O
. O

We O
belong O
to O
Christ O
so O
that O
we O
can O
be O
used O
in O
service O
to O
God O
. O

In O
the O
past O
we O
were O
ruled O
by O
our O
sinful O
selves O
. O

The O
law O
made O
us O
want O
to O
do O
sinful O
things O
. O

And O
those O
sinful O
desires O
controlled O
our O
bodies O
, O
so O
that O
what O
we O
did O
only O
brought O
us O
spiritual O
death O
. O

In O
the O
past O
the O
law O
held O
us O
as O
prisoners O
, O
but O
our O
old O
selves O
died O
, O
and O
we O
were O
made O
free O
from O
the O
law O
. O

So O
now O
we O
serve O
God O
in O
a O
new O
way O
, O
not O
in O
the O
old O
way O
, O
with O
the O
written O
rules O
. O

Now O
we O
serve O
God O
in O
the O
new O
way O
, O
with O
the O
Spirit O
. O

You O
might O
think O
I O
am O
saying O
that O
sin O
and O
the O
law O
are O
the O
same O
. O

That O
is O
not O
true O
. O

But O
the O
law O
was O
the O
only O
way O
I O
could O
learn O
what O
sin O
means O
. O

I O
would O
never O
have O
known O
it O
is O
wrong O
to O
want O
something O
that O
is O
not O
mine O
. O

But O
the O
law O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
must O
not O
want O
what O
belongs O
to O
someone O
else O
. O
'' O

And O
sin O
found O
a O
way O
to O
use O
that O
command O
and O
make O
me O
want O
all O
kinds O
of O
things O
that O
were O
n't O
mine O
. O

So O
sin O
came O
to O
me O
because O
of O
the O
command O
. O

But O
without O
the O
law O
, O
sin O
has O
no O
power O
. O

Before O
I O
knew O
the O
law O
, O
I O
was O
alive O
. O

But O
when O
I O
heard O
the O
law O
's O
command O
, O
sin O
began O
to O
live O
, O
and O
I O
died O
spiritually O
. O

The O
command O
was O
meant O
to O
bring O
life O
, O
but O
for O
me O
it O
brought O
death O
. O

Sin O
found O
a O
way O
to O
fool O
me O
by O
using O
the O
command O
to O
make O
me O
die O
. O

Now O
the O
law O
is O
holy O
, O
and O
the O
command O
is O
holy O
and O
right O
and O
good O
. O

Does O
this O
mean O
that O
something O
that O
is O
good O
brought O
death O
to O
me O
? O

No O
, O
it O
was O
sin O
that O
used O
the O
good O
command O
to O
bring O
me O
death O
. O

This O
shows O
how O
terrible O
sin O
really O
is O
. O

It O
can O
use O
a O
good O
command O
to O
produce O
a O
result O
that O
shows O
sin O
at O
its O
very O
worst O
. O

We O
know O
that O
the O
law O
is O
spiritual O
, O
but O
I O
am O
not O
. O

I O
am O
so O
human O
. O

Sin O
rules O
me O
as O
if O
I O
were O
its O
slave O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
understand O
why O
I O
act O
the O
way O
I O
do O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
do O
the O
good O
I O
want O
to O
do O
, O
and O
I O
do O
the O
evil O
I O
hate O
. O

And O
if O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
do O
what O
I O
do O
, O
that O
means O
I O
agree O
that O
the O
law O
is O
good O
. O

But O
I O
am O
not O
really O
the O
one O
doing O
the O
evil O
. O

It O
is O
sin O
living O
in O
me O
that O
does O
it O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
know O
that O
nothing O
good O
lives O
in O
me O
-- O
I O
mean O
nothing O
good O
lives O
in O
the O
part O
of O
me O
that O
is O
not O
spiritual O
. O

I O
want O
to O
do O
what O
is O
good O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
do O
it O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
do O
the O
good O
that O
I O
want O
to O
do O
. O

I O
do O
the O
evil O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
do O
. O

So O
if O
I O
do O
what O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
do O
, O
then O
I O
am O
not O
really O
the O
one O
doing O
it O
. O

It O
is O
the O
sin O
living O
in O
me O
that O
does O
it O
. O

So O
I O
have O
learned O
this O
rule O
: O
When O
I O
want O
to O
do O
good O
, O
evil O
is O
there O
with O
me O
. O

In O
my O
mind O
I O
am O
happy O
with O
God O
's O
law O
. O

But O
I O
see O
another O
law O
working O
in O
my O
body O
. O

That O
law O
makes O
war O
against O
the O
law O
that O
my O
mind O
accepts O
. O

That O
other O
law O
working O
in O
my O
body O
is O
the O
law O
of O
sin O
, O
and O
that O
law O
makes O
me O
its O
prisoner O
. O

What O
a O
miserable O
person O
I O
am O
! O

Who O
will O
save O
me O
from O
this O
body O
that O
brings O
me O
death O
? O

I O
thank O
God O
for O
his O
salvation O
through O
Jesus O
Christ O
our O
Lord O
! O

So O
in O
my O
mind O
I O
am O
a O
slave O
to O
God O
's O
law O
, O
but O
in O
my O
sinful O
self O
I O
am O
a O
slave O
to O
the O
law O
of O
sin O
. O

Some O
of O
us O
have O
no O
problem O
with O
these O
things O
. O

So O
we O
should O
be O
patient O
with O
those O
who O
are O
not O
so O
strong O
and O
have O
doubts O
. O

We O
should O
not O
do O
what O
pleases O
us O
but O
do O
what O
pleases O
them O
and O
is O
for O
their O
good O
. O

We O
should O
do O
whatever O
helps O
everyone O
grow O
stronger O
in O
faith O
. O

Even O
Christ O
did O
not O
live O
trying O
to O
please O
himself O
. O

As O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
about O
him O
, O
`` O
Those O
people O
who O
insulted O
you O
have O
also O
insulted O
me O
. O
'' O

Everything O
that O
was O
written O
in O
the O
past O
was O
written O
to O
teach O
us O
. O

Those O
things O
were O
written O
so O
that O
we O
could O
have O
hope O
. O

That O
hope O
comes O
from O
the O
patience O
and O
encouragement O
that O
the O
Scriptures O
give O
us O
. O

All O
patience O
and O
encouragement O
come O
from O
God O
. O

And O
I O
pray O
that O
God O
will O
help O
you O
all O
agree O
with O
each O
other O
, O
as O
Christ O
Jesus O
wants O
. O

Then O
you O
will O
all O
be O
joined O
together O
. O

And O
all O
together O
you O
will O
give O
glory O
to O
God O
the O
Father O
of O
our O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

Christ O
accepted O
you O
, O
so O
you O
should O
accept O
each O
other O
. O

This O
will O
bring O
honor O
to O
God O
. O

I O
tell O
you O
that O
Christ O
became O
a O
servant O
of O
the O
Jews O
to O
show O
that O
God O
has O
done O
what O
he O
promised O
their O
great O
ancestors O
. O

Christ O
also O
did O
this O
so O
that O
the O
non-Jewish O
people O
could O
praise O
God O
for O
the O
mercy O
he O
gives O
to O
them O
. O

The O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
So O
I O
will O
give O
thanks O
to O
you O
among O
the O
people O
of O
other O
nations O
; O
I O
will O
sing O
praise O
to O
your O
name O
. O
'' O

And O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
You O
people O
of O
other O
nations O
should O
be O
happy O
together O
with O
God O
's O
people O
. O
'' O

The O
Scriptures O
also O
say O
, O
`` O
Praise O
the O
Lord O
all O
you O
people O
of O
other O
nations O
; O
all O
people O
should O
praise O
the O
Lord O
. O
'' O

And O
Isaiah O
says O
, O
`` O
Someone O
will O
come O
from O
Jesse O
's O
family O
. O

He O
will O
come O
to O
rule O
over O
the O
nations O
, O
and O
they O
will O
put O
their O
hope O
in O
him O
. O
'' O

I O
pray O
that O
the O
God O
who O
gives O
hope O
will O
fill O
you O
with O
much O
joy O
and O
peace O
as O
you O
trust O
in O
him O
. O

Then O
you O
will O
have O
more O
and O
more O
hope O
, O
and O
it O
will O
flow O
out O
of O
you O
by O
the O
power O
of O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
. O

My O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
I O
know O
without O
a O
doubt O
that O
you O
are O
full O
of O
goodness O
and O
have O
all O
the O
knowledge O
you O
need O
. O

So O
you O
are O
certainly O
able O
to O
counsel O
each O
other O
. O

But O
I O
have O
written O
to O
you O
very O
openly O
about O
some O
things O
that O
I O
wanted O
you O
to O
remember O
. O

I O
did O
this O
because O
God O
gave O
me O
this O
special O
gift O
: O
to O
be O
a O
servant O
of O
Christ O
Jesus O
for O
those O
who O
are O
not O
Jews O
. O

I O
serve O
like O
a O
priest O
whose O
duty O
it O
is O
to O
tell O
God O
's O
Good O
News O
. O

He O
gave O
me O
this O
work O
so O
that O
you O
non-Jewish O
people O
could O
be O
an O
offering O
that O
he O
will O
accept O
-- O
an O
offering O
made O
holy O
by O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
. O

That O
is O
why O
I O
feel O
so O
good O
about O
what O
I O
have O
done O
for O
God O
in O
my O
service O
to O
Christ O
Jesus O
. O

I O
will O
not O
talk O
about O
anything O
I O
did O
myself O
. O

I O
will O
talk O
only O
about O
what O
Christ O
has O
done O
with O
me O
in O
leading O
the O
non-Jewish O
people O
to O
obey O
God O
. O

They O
have O
obeyed O
him O
because O
of O
what O
I O
have O
said O
and O
done O
. O

And O
they O
obeyed O
him O
because O
of O
the O
power O
of O
the O
miraculous O
signs O
and O
wonders O
that O
happened O
-- O
all O
because O
of O
the O
power O
of O
God O
's O
Spirit O
. O

I O
have O
told O
people O
the O
Good O
News O
about O
Christ O
in O
every O
place O
from O
Jerusalem O
to O
Illyricum O
. O

And O
so O
I O
have O
finished O
that O
part O
of O
my O
work O
. O

I O
always O
want O
to O
tell O
the O
Good O
News O
in O
places O
where O
people O
have O
never O
heard O
of O
Christ O
. O

I O
do O
this O
because O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
build O
on O
the O
work O
that O
someone O
else O
has O
already O
started O
. O

But O
as O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
Those O
who O
were O
not O
told O
about O
him O
will O
see O
, O
and O
those O
who O
have O
not O
heard O
about O
him O
will O
understand O
. O
'' O

That O
's O
what O
has O
kept O
me O
so O
busy O
and O
prevented O
my O
coming O
to O
see O
you O
even O
though O
I O
have O
wanted O
to O
come O
many O
times O
. O

Now O
I O
have O
finished O
my O
work O
in O
these O
areas O
. O

And O
for O
many O
years O
I O
have O
wanted O
to O
visit O
you O
. O

So O
I O
will O
visit O
you O
when O
I O
go O
to O
Spain O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
hope O
to O
visit O
you O
while O
I O
am O
traveling O
to O
Spain O
, O
and O
I O
will O
stay O
and O
enjoy O
being O
with O
you O
. O

Then O
you O
can O
help O
me O
continue O
on O
my O
trip O
. O

Now O
I O
am O
going O
to O
Jerusalem O
to O
help O
God O
's O
people O
there O
. O

Some O
of O
them O
are O
poor O
, O
and O
the O
believers O
in O
Macedonia O
and O
Achaia O
wanted O
to O
help O
them O
. O

So O
they O
gathered O
some O
money O
to O
send O
them O
. O

They O
were O
happy O
to O
do O
this O
. O

And O
it O
was O
like O
paying O
something O
they O
owed O
them O
, O
because O
as O
non-Jews O
they O
have O
been O
blessed O
spiritually O
by O
the O
Jews O
. O

So O
now O
they O
should O
use O
the O
material O
blessings O
they O
have O
to O
help O
the O
Jews O
. O

I O
am O
going O
to O
Jerusalem O
to O
make O
sure O
the O
poor O
get O
this O
money O
that O
has O
been O
given O
for O
them O
. O

After O
I O
finish O
that O
, O
I O
will O
leave O
for O
Spain O
and O
stop O
to O
visit O
you O
on O
the O
way O
. O

And O
I O
know O
that O
when O
I O
visit O
you O
, O
I O
will O
bring O
you O
Christ O
's O
full O
blessing O
. O

Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
I O
beg O
you O
to O
help O
me O
in O
my O
work O
by O
praying O
to O
God O
for O
me O
. O

Do O
this O
because O
of O
our O
Lord O
Jesus O
and O
the O
love O
that O
the O
Spirit O
gives O
us O
. O

Pray O
that O
I O
will O
be O
saved O
from O
those O
in O
Judea O
who O
refuse O
to O
accept O
our O
message O
. O

And O
pray O
that O
this O
help O
I O
am O
bringing O
to O
Jerusalem O
will O
please O
God O
's O
people O
there O
. O

Then O
, O
if O
God O
wants O
me O
to O
, O
I O
will O
come O
to O
you O
. O

I O
will O
come O
with O
joy O
, O
and O
together O
you O
and O
I O
will O
have O
a O
time O
of O
rest O
. O

The O
God O
who O
gives O
peace O
be O
with O
you O
all O
. O

Amen O
. O

Now O
, O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
I O
want O
you O
to O
remember O
the O
Good O
News O
I O
told O
you O
about O
. O

You O
received O
that O
Good O
News O
message O
, O
and O
you O
continue O
to O
base O
your O
life O
on O
it O
. O

It O
is O
that O
Good O
News O
that O
saves O
you O
, O
but O
you O
must O
continue O
believing O
the O
message O
just O
as O
I O
told O
it O
to O
you O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
, O
then O
you O
believed O
for O
nothing O
. O

I O
gave O
you O
the O
message O
that O
I O
received O
. O

I O
told O
you O
the O
most O
important O
truths O
: O
that O
Christ O
died O
for O
our O
sins O
, O
as O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
; O
that O
he O
was O
buried O
and O
was O
raised O
to O
life O
on O
the O
third O
day O
, O
as O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
; O
and O
that O
he O
appeared O
to O
Peter O
and O
then O
to O
the O
twelve O
apostles O
. O

After O
that O
, O
Christ O
appeared O
to O
more O
than O
500 O

of O
the O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

Most O
of O
them O
are O
still O
living O
today O
, O
but O
some O
have O
died O
. O

Then O
he O
appeared O
to O
James O
and O
later O
to O
all O
the O
apostles O
. O

Last O
of O
all O
, O
he O
appeared O
to O
me O
. O

I O
was O
different O
, O
like O
a O
baby O
born O
before O
the O
normal O
time O
. O

All O
the O
other O
apostles O
are O
greater O
than O
I O
am O
. O

I O
say O
this O
because O
I O
persecuted O
the O
church O
of O
God O
. O

That O
is O
why O
I O
am O
not O
even O
good O
enough O
to O
be O
called O
an O
apostle O
. O

But O
, O
because O
of O
God O
's O
grace O
, O
that O
is O
what O
I O
am O
. O

And O
his O
grace O
that O
he O
gave O
me O
was O
not O
wasted O
. O

I O
worked O
harder O
than O
all O
the O
other O
apostles O
. O

-LRB- O
But O
I O
was O
not O
really O
the O
one O
working O
. O

It O
was O
God O
's O
grace O
that O
was O
with O
me O
. O
-RRB- O

So O
then O
it O
is O
not O
important O
if O
I O
told O
you O
God O
's O
message O
or O
if O
it O
was O
the O
other O
apostles O
who O
told O
you O
-- O
we O
all O
tell O
people O
the O
same O
message O
, O
and O
this O
is O
what O
you O
believed O
. O

We O
tell O
everyone O
that O
Christ O
was O
raised O
from O
death O
. O

So O
why O
do O
some O
of O
you O
say O
that O
people O
will O
not O
be O
raised O
from O
death O
? O

If O
no O
one O
will O
ever O
be O
raised O
from O
death O
, O
then O
Christ O
has O
never O
been O
raised O
. O

And O
if O
Christ O
has O
never O
been O
raised O
, O
then O
the O
message O
we O
tell O
is O
worth O
nothing O
. O

And O
your O
faith O
is O
worth O
nothing O
. O

And O
we O
will O
also O
be O
guilty O
of O
lying O
about O
God O
, O
because O
we O
have O
told O
people O
about O
him O
, O
saying O
that O
he O
raised O
Christ O
from O
death O
. O

And O
if O
no O
one O
is O
raised O
from O
death O
, O
then O
God O
never O
raised O
Christ O
from O
death O
. O

If O
those O
who O
have O
died O
are O
not O
raised O
, O
then O
Christ O
has O
not O
been O
raised O
either O
. O

And O
if O
Christ O
has O
not O
been O
raised O
from O
death O
, O
then O
your O
faith O
is O
for O
nothing O
; O
you O
are O
still O
guilty O
of O
your O
sins O
. O

And O
those O
in O
Christ O
who O
have O
already O
died O
are O
lost O
. O

If O
our O
hope O
in O
Christ O
is O
only O
for O
this O
life O
here O
on O
earth O
, O
then O
people O
should O
feel O
more O
sorry O
for O
us O
than O
for O
anyone O
else O
. O

But O
Christ O
really O
has O
been O
raised O
from O
death O
-- O
the O
first O
one O
of O
all O
those O
who O
will O
be O
raised O
. O

Death O
comes O
to O
people O
because O
of O
what O
one O
man O
did O
. O

But O
now O
there O
is O
resurrection O
from O
death O
because O
of O
another O
man O
. O

I O
mean O
that O
in O
Adam O
all O
of O
us O
die O
. O

And O
in O
the O
same O
way O
, O
in O
Christ O
all O
of O
us O
will O
be O
made O
alive O
again O
. O

But O
everyone O
will O
be O
raised O
to O
life O
in O
the O
right O
order O
. O

Christ O
was O
first O
to O
be O
raised O
. O

Then O
, O
when O
Christ O
comes O
again O
, O
those O
who O
belong O
to O
him O
will O
be O
raised O
to O
life O
. O

Then O
the O
end O
will O
come O
. O

Christ O
will O
destroy O
all O
rulers O
, O
authorities O
, O
and O
powers O
. O

Then O
he O
will O
give O
the O
kingdom O
to O
God O
the O
Father O
. O

Christ O
must O
rule O
until O
God O
puts O
all O
enemies O
under O
his O
control O
. O

The O
last O
enemy O
to O
be O
destroyed O
will O
be O
death O
. O

As O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
God O
put O
everything O
under O
his O
control O
. O
'' O

When O
it O
says O
that O
`` O
everything O
'' O
is O
put O
under O
him O
, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
this O
does O
not O
include O
God O
himself O
. O

God O
is O
the O
one O
putting O
everything O
under O
Christ O
's O
control O
. O

After O
everything O
has O
been O
put O
under O
Christ O
, O
then O
the O
Son O
himself O
will O
be O
put O
under O
God O
. O

God O
is O
the O
one O
who O
put O
everything O
under O
Christ O
. O

And O
Christ O
will O
be O
put O
under O
God O
so O
that O
God O
will O
be O
the O
complete O
ruler O
over O
everything O
. O

If O
no O
one O
will O
ever O
be O
raised O
from O
death O
, O
then O
what O
will O
the O
people O
do O
who O
are O
baptized O
for O
those O
who O
have O
died O
? O

If O
the O
dead O
are O
never O
raised O
, O
then O
why O
are O
people O
baptized O
for O
them O
? O

And O
what O
about O
us O
? O

Why O
do O
we O
put O
ourselves O
in O
danger O
every O
hour O
? O

I O
face O
death O
every O
day O
. O

That O
is O
true O
, O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
just O
as O
it O
is O
true O
that O
I O
am O
proud O
of O
what O
you O
are O
because O
of O
Christ O
Jesus O
our O
Lord O
. O

I O
fought O
wild O
animals O
in O
Ephesus O
. O

If O
I O
did O
that O
only O
for O
human O
reasons O
, O
then O
I O
have O
gained O
nothing O
. O

If O
we O
are O
not O
raised O
from O
death O
, O
`` O
Let O
us O
eat O
and O
drink O
, O
because O
tomorrow O
we O
die O
. O
'' O

Do O
n't O
be O
fooled O
: O
`` O
Bad O
friends O
will O
ruin O
good O
habits O
. O
'' O

Come O
back O
to O
your O
right O
way O
of O
thinking O
and O
stop O
sinning O
. O

Some O
of O
you O
do O
n't O
know O
God O
. O

I O
say O
this O
to O
shame O
you O
. O

But O
someone O
may O
ask O
, O
`` O
How O
are O
the O
dead O
raised O
? O

What O
kind O
of O
body O
will O
they O
have O
? O
'' O

These O
are O
stupid O
questions O
. O

When O
you O
plant O
something O
, O
it O
must O
die O
in O
the O
ground O
before O
it O
can O
live O
and O
grow O
. O

And O
when O
you O
plant O
something O
, O
what O
you O
plant O
does O
not O
have O
the O
same O
`` O
body O
'' O
that O
it O
will O
have O
later O
. O

What O
you O
plant O
is O
only O
a O
seed O
, O
maybe O
wheat O
or O
something O
else O
. O

But O
God O
gives O
it O
the O
body O
that O
he O
has O
planned O
for O
it O
, O
and O
he O
gives O
each O
kind O
of O
seed O
its O
own O
body O
. O

All O
things O
made O
of O
flesh O
are O
not O
the O
same O
: O
People O
have O
one O
kind O
of O
flesh O
, O
animals O
have O
another O
, O
birds O
have O
another O
, O
and O
fish O
have O
yet O
another O
kind O
. O

Also O
there O
are O
heavenly O
bodies O
and O
earthly O
bodies O
. O

But O
the O
beauty O
of O
the O
heavenly O
bodies O
is O
one O
kind O
, O
and O
the O
beauty O
of O
the O
earthly O
bodies O
is O
another O
. O

The O
sun O
has O
one O
kind O
of O
beauty O
, O
the O
moon O
has O
another O
kind O
, O
and O
the O
stars O
have O
another O
. O

And O
each O
star O
is O
different O
in O
its O
beauty O
. O

It O
will O
be O
the O
same O
when O
those O
who O
have O
died O
are O
raised O
to O
life O
. O

The O
body O
that O
is O
`` O
planted O
'' O
in O
the O
grave O
will O
ruin O
and O
decay O
, O
but O
it O
will O
be O
raised O
to O
a O
life O
that O
can O
not O
be O
destroyed O
. O

When O
the O
body O
is O
`` O
planted O
, O
'' O
it O
is O
without O
honor O
. O

But O
when O
it O
is O
raised O
, O
it O
will O
be O
great O
and O
glorious O
. O

When O
the O
body O
is O
`` O
planted O
, O
'' O
it O
is O
weak O
. O

But O
when O
it O
is O
raised O
, O
it O
will O
be O
full O
of O
power O
. O

The O
body O
that O
is O
`` O
planted O
'' O
is O
a O
physical O
body O
. O

When O
it O
is O
raised O
, O
it O
will O
be O
a O
spiritual O
body O
. O

There O
is O
a O
physical O
body O
. O

So O
there O
is O
also O
a O
spiritual O
body O
. O

As O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
The O
first O
man O
, O
Adam O
, O
became O
a O
living O
person O
. O
'' O

But O
the O
last O
Adam O
is O
a O
life O
- O
giving O
spirit O
. O

The O
spiritual O
man O
did O
not O
come O
first O
. O

It O
was O
the O
physical O
man O
that O
came O
first O
; O
then O
came O
the O
spiritual O
. O

The O
first O
man O
came O
from O
the O
dust O
of O
the O
earth O
. O

The O
second O
man O
came O
from O
heaven O
. O

All O
people O
belong O
to O
the O
earth O
. O

They O
are O
like O
that O
first O
man O
of O
earth O
. O

But O
those O
who O
belong O
to O
heaven O
are O
like O
that O
man O
of O
heaven O
. O

We O
were O
made O
like O
that O
man O
of O
earth O
, O
so O
we O
will O
also O
be O
made O
like O
that O
man O
of O
heaven O
. O

I O
tell O
you O
this O
, O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
: O
Our O
bodies O
of O
flesh O
and O
blood O
can O
not O
have O
a O
part O
in O
God O
's O
kingdom O
. O

Something O
that O
will O
ruin O
can O
not O
have O
a O
part O
in O
something O
that O
never O
ruins O
. O

But O
listen O
, O
I O
tell O
you O
this O
secret O
: O
We O
will O
not O
all O
die O
, O
but O
we O
will O
all O
be O
changed O
. O

It O
will O
only O
take O
the O
time O
of O
a O
second O
. O

We O
will O
be O
changed O
as O
quickly O
as O
an O
eye O
blinks O
. O

This O
will O
happen O
when O
the O
last O
trumpet O
blows O
. O

The O
trumpet O
will O
blow O
and O
those O
who O
have O
died O
will O
be O
raised O
to O
live O
forever O
. O

And O
we O
will O
all O
be O
changed O
. O

This O
body O
that O
ruins O
must O
clothe O
itself O
with O
something O
that O
will O
never O
ruin O
. O

And O
this O
body O
that O
dies O
must O
clothe O
itself O
with O
something O
that O
will O
never O
die O
. O

So O
this O
body O
that O
ruins O
will O
clothe O
itself O
with O
that O
which O
never O
ruins O
. O

And O
this O
body O
that O
dies O
will O
clothe O
itself O
with O
that O
which O
never O
dies O
. O

When O
this O
happens O
, O
the O
Scriptures O
will O
be O
made O
true O
: O
`` O
Death O
is O
swallowed O
in O
victory O
. O
'' O

`` O
O O
death O
, O
where O
is O
your O
victory O
? O

Where O
is O
your O
power O
to O
hurt O
? O
'' O

Death O
's O
power O
to O
hurt O
is O
sin O
, O
and O
the O
power O
of O
sin O
is O
the O
law O
. O

But O
we O
thank O
God O
who O
gives O
us O
the O
victory O
through O
our O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
! O

So O
, O
my O
dear O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
stand O
strong O
. O

Do O
n't O
let O
anything O
change O
you O
. O

Always O
give O
yourselves O
fully O
to O
the O
work O
of O
the O
Lord O
. O

You O
know O
that O
your O
work O
in O
the O
Lord O
is O
never O
wasted O
. O

Greetings O
from O
Paul O
. O

I O
was O
chosen O
to O
be O
an O
apostle O
of O
Christ O
Jesus O
. O

God O
chose O
me O
because O
that O
is O
what O
he O
wanted O
. O

Greetings O
also O
from O
Sosthenes O
, O
our O
brother O
in O
Christ O
. O

To O
God O
's O
church O
in O
Corinth O
, O
you O
who O
have O
been O
made O
holy O
because O
you O
belong O
to O
Christ O
Jesus O
. O

You O
were O
chosen O
to O
be O
God O
's O
holy O
people O
together O
with O
all O
people O
everywhere O
who O
trust O
in O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
-- O
their O
Lord O
and O
ours O
. O

Grace O
and O
peace O
to O
you O
from O
God O
our O
Father O
and O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

I O
always O
thank O
my O
God O
for O
you O
because O
of O
the O
grace O
that O
he O
has O
given O
you O
through O
Christ O
Jesus O
. O

In O
him O
you O
have O
been O
blessed O
in O
every O
way O
. O

You O
have O
been O
blessed O
in O
all O
your O
speaking O
and O
all O
your O
knowledge O
. O

This O
proves O
that O
what O
we O
told O
you O
about O
Christ O
is O
true O
. O

Now O
you O
have O
every O
gift O
from O
God O
while O
you O
wait O
for O
our O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
to O
come O
again O
. O

He O
will O
keep O
you O
strong O
until O
the O
end O
so O
that O
on O
the O
day O
when O
our O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
comes O
, O
you O
will O
be O
free O
from O
all O
blame O
. O

God O
is O
faithful O
. O

He O
is O
the O
one O
who O
has O
chosen O
you O
to O
share O
life O
with O
his O
Son O
, O
Jesus O
Christ O
our O
Lord O
. O

Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
by O
the O
authority O
of O
our O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
, O
I O
beg O
all O
of O
you O
to O
agree O
with O
each O
other O
. O

You O
should O
not O
be O
divided O
into O
different O
groups O
. O

Be O
completely O
joined O
together O
again O
with O
the O
same O
kind O
of O
thinking O
and O
the O
same O
purpose O
. O

My O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
some O
members O
of O
Chloe O
's O
family O
told O
me O
that O
there O
are O
arguments O
among O
you O
. O

This O
is O
what O
I O
mean O
: O
One O
of O
you O
says O
, O
`` O
I O
follow O
Paul O
, O
'' O
and O
someone O
else O
says O
, O
`` O
I O
follow O
Apollos O
. O
'' O

Another O
says O
, O
`` O
I O
follow O
Peter O
, O
'' O
and O
someone O
else O
says O
, O
`` O
I O
follow O
Christ O
. O
'' O

Christ O
can O
not O
be O
divided O
into O
different O
groups O
. O

It O
was O
n't O
Paul O
who O
died O
on O
the O
cross O
for O
you O
, O
was O
it O
? O

Were O
you O
baptized O
in O
Paul O
's O
name O
? O

I O
am O
thankful O
that O
I O
did O
not O
baptize O
any O
of O
you O
except O
Crispus O
and O
Gaius O
. O

I O
am O
thankful O
because O
now O
no O
one O
can O
say O
that O
you O
were O
baptized O
in O
my O
name O
. O

-LRB- O
I O
also O
baptized O
the O
family O
of O
Stephanas O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
remember O
that O
I O
myself O
baptized O
any O
others O
. O
-RRB- O

Christ O
did O
not O
give O
me O
the O
work O
of O
baptizing O
people O
. O

He O
gave O
me O
the O
work O
of O
telling O
the O
Good O
News O
. O

But O
he O
sent O
me O
to O
tell O
the O
Good O
News O
without O
using O
clever O
speech O
, O
which O
would O
take O
away O
the O
power O
that O
is O
in O
the O
cross O
of O
Christ O
. O

The O
teaching O
about O
the O
cross O
seems O
foolish O
to O
those O
who O
are O
lost O
. O

But O
to O
us O
who O
are O
being O
saved O
it O
is O
the O
power O
of O
God O
. O

As O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
I O
will O
destroy O
the O
wisdom O
of O
the O
wise O
. O

I O
will O
confuse O
the O
understanding O
of O
the O
intelligent O
. O
'' O

So O
what O
does O
this O
say O
about O
the O
philosopher O
, O
the O
law O
expert O
, O
or O
anyone O
in O
this O
world O
who O
is O
skilled O
in O
making O
clever O
arguments O
? O

God O
has O
made O
the O
wisdom O
of O
the O
world O
look O
foolish O
. O

This O
is O
what O
God O
in O
his O
wisdom O
decided O
: O
Since O
the O
world O
did O
not O
find O
him O
through O
its O
own O
wisdom O
, O
he O
used O
the O
message O
that O
sounds O
foolish O
to O
save O
those O
who O
believe O
it O
. O

The O
Jews O
ask O
for O
miraculous O
signs O
, O
and O
the O
Greeks O
want O
wisdom O
. O

But O
this O
is O
the O
message O
we O
tell O
everyone O
: O

Christ O
was O
killed O
on O
a O
cross O
. O

This O
message O
is O
a O
problem O
for O
Jews O
, O
and O
to O
other O
people O
it O
is O
nonsense O
. O

But O
Christ O
is O
God O
's O
power O
and O
wisdom O
to O
the O
people O
God O
has O
chosen O
, O
both O
Jews O
and O
Greeks O
. O

Even O
the O
foolishness O
of O
God O
is O
wiser O
than O
human O
wisdom O
. O

Even O
the O
weakness O
of O
God O
is O
stronger O
than O
human O
strength O
. O

Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
God O
chose O
you O
to O
be O
his O
. O

Think O
about O
that O
! O

Not O
many O
of O
you O
were O
wise O
in O
the O
way O
the O
world O
judges O
wisdom O
. O

Not O
many O
of O
you O
had O
great O
influence O
, O
and O
not O
many O
of O
you O
came O
from O
important O
families O
. O

But O
God O
chose O
the O
foolish O
things O
of O
the O
world O
to O
shame O
the O
wise O
. O

He O
chose O
the O
weak O
things O
of O
the O
world O
to O
shame O
the O
strong O
. O

And O
God O
chose O
what O
the O
world O
thinks O
is O
not O
important O
-- O
what O
the O
world O
hates O
and O
thinks O
is O
nothing O
. O

He O
chose O
these O
to O
destroy O
what O
the O
world O
thinks O
is O
important O
. O

God O
did O
this O
so O
that O
no O
one O
can O
stand O
before O
him O
and O
boast O
about O
anything O
. O

It O
is O
God O
who O
has O
made O
you O
part O
of O
Christ O
Jesus O
. O

And O
Christ O
has O
become O
for O
us O
wisdom O
from O
God O
. O

He O
is O
the O
reason O
we O
are O
right O
with O
God O
and O
pure O
enough O
to O
be O
in O
his O
presence O
. O

Christ O
is O
the O
one O
who O
set O
us O
free O
from O
sin O
. O

So O
, O
as O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
Whoever O
boasts O
should O
boast O
only O
about O
the O
Lord O
. O
'' O

I O
may O
speak O
in O
different O
languages O
, O
whether O
human O
or O
even O
of O
angels O
. O

But O
if O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
love O
, O
I O
am O
only O
a O
noisy O
bell O
or O
a O
ringing O
cymbal O
. O

I O
may O
have O
the O
gift O
of O
prophecy O
, O
I O
may O
understand O
all O
secrets O
and O
know O
everything O
there O
is O
to O
know O
, O
and O
I O
may O
have O
faith O
so O
great O
that O
I O
can O
move O
mountains O
. O

But O
even O
with O
all O
this O
, O
if O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
love O
, O
I O
am O
nothing O
. O

I O
may O
give O
away O
everything O
I O
have O
to O
help O
others O
, O
and O
I O
may O
even O
give O
my O
body O
as O
an O
offering O
to O
be O
burned O
. O

But O
I O
gain O
nothing O
by O
doing O
all O
this O
if O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
love O
. O

Love O
is O
patient O
and O
kind O
. O

Love O
is O
not O
jealous O
, O
it O
does O
not O
brag O
, O
and O
it O
is O
not O
proud O
. O

Love O
is O
not O
rude O
, O
it O
is O
not O
selfish O
, O
and O
it O
can O
not O
be O
made O
angry O
easily O
. O

Love O
does O
not O
remember O
wrongs O
done O
against O
it O
. O

Love O
is O
never O
happy O
when O
others O
do O
wrong O
, O
but O
it O
is O
always O
happy O
with O
the O
truth O
. O

Love O
never O
gives O
up O
on O
people O
. O

It O
never O
stops O
trusting O
, O
never O
loses O
hope O
, O
and O
never O
quits O
. O

Love O
will O
never O
end O
. O

But O
all O
those O
gifts O
will O
come O
to O
an O
end O
-- O
even O
the O
gift O
of O
prophecy O
, O
the O
gift O
of O
speaking O
in O
different O
kinds O
of O
languages O
, O
and O
the O
gift O
of O
knowledge O
. O

These O
will O
all O
end O
because O
this O
knowledge O
and O
these O
prophecies O
we O
have O
are O
not O
complete O
. O

But O
when O
perfection O
comes O
, O
the O
things O
that O
are O
not O
complete O
will O
end O
. O

When O
I O
was O
a O
child O
, O
I O
talked O
like O
a O
child O
, O
I O
thought O
like O
a O
child O
, O
and O
I O
made O
plans O
like O
a O
child O
. O

When O
I O
became O
a O
man O
, O
I O
stopped O
those O
childish O
ways O
. O

It O
is O
the O
same O
with O
us O
. O

Now O
we O
see O
God O
as O
if O
we O
are O
looking O
at O
a O
reflection O
in O
a O
mirror O
. O

But O
then O
, O
in O
the O
future O
, O
we O
will O
see O
him O
right O
before O
our O
eyes O
. O

Now O
I O
know O
only O
a O
part O
, O
but O
at O
that O
time O
I O
will O
know O
fully O
, O
as O
God O
has O
known O
me O
. O

So O
these O
three O
things O
continue O
: O
faith O
, O
hope O
, O
and O
love O
. O

And O
the O
greatest O
of O
these O
is O
love O
. O

Dear O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
when O
I O
came O
to O
you O
, O
I O
told O
you O
the O
secret O
truth O
of O
God O
. O

But O
I O
did O
not O
use O
fancy O
words O
or O
great O
wisdom O
. O

I O
decided O
that O
while O
I O
was O
with O
you O
I O
would O
forget O
about O
everything O
except O
Jesus O
Christ O
and O
his O
death O
on O
the O
cross O
. O

When O
I O
came O
to O
you O
, O
I O
was O
weak O
and O
shook O
with O
fear O
. O

My O
teaching O
and O
my O
speaking O
were O
not O
with O
wise O
words O
that O
persuade O
people O
. O

But O
the O
proof O
of O
my O
teaching O
was O
the O
power O
that O
the O
Spirit O
gives O
. O

I O
did O
this O
so O
that O
your O
faith O
would O
be O
in O
God O
's O
power O
, O
not O
in O
human O
wisdom O
. O

We O
teach O
wisdom O
to O
people O
who O
are O
mature O
, O
but O
the O
wisdom O
we O
teach O
is O
not O
from O
this O
world O
. O

It O
is O
not O
the O
wisdom O
of O
the O
rulers O
of O
this O
world O
, O
who O
are O
losing O
their O
power O
. O

But O
we O
speak O
God O
's O
secret O
wisdom O
that O
has O
been O
hidden O
from O
everyone O
until O
now O
. O

God O
planned O
this O
wisdom O
for O
our O
glory O
. O

He O
planned O
it O
before O
the O
world O
began O
. O

None O
of O
the O
rulers O
of O
this O
world O
understood O
this O
wisdom O
. O

If O
they O
had O
understood O
it O
, O
they O
would O
not O
have O
killed O
our O
great O
and O
glorious O
Lord O
on O
a O
cross O
. O

But O
as O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
No O
one O
has O
ever O
seen O
, O
no O
one O
has O
ever O
heard O
, O
no O
one O
has O
ever O
imagined O
what O
God O
has O
prepared O
for O
those O
who O
love O
him O
. O
'' O

But O
God O
has O
shown O
us O
these O
things O
through O
the O
Spirit O
. O

The O
Spirit O
knows O
all O
things O
. O

The O
Spirit O
even O
knows O
the O
deep O
secrets O
of O
God O
. O

It O
is O
like O
this O
: O
No O
one O
knows O
the O
thoughts O
that O
another O
person O
has O
. O

Only O
the O
person O
's O
spirit O
that O
lives O
inside O
knows O
those O
thoughts O
. O

It O
is O
the O
same O
with O
God O
. O

No O
one O
knows O
God O
's O
thoughts O
except O
God O
's O
Spirit O
. O

We O
received O
the O
Spirit O
that O
is O
from O
God O
, O
not O
the O
spirit O
of O
the O
world O
. O

We O
received O
God O
's O
Spirit O
so O
that O
we O
can O
know O
all O
that O
God O
has O
given O
us O
. O

When O
we O
say O
this O
, O
we O
do O
n't O
use O
words O
taught O
to O
us O
by O
human O
wisdom O
. O

We O
use O
words O
taught O
to O
us O
by O
the O
Spirit O
. O

We O
use O
the O
Spirit O
's O
words O
to O
explain O
spiritual O
truths O
. O

People O
who O
do O
not O
have O
God O
's O
Spirit O
do O
not O
accept O
the O
things O
that O
come O
from O
his O
Spirit O
. O

They O
think O
these O
things O
are O
foolish O
. O

They O
can O
not O
understand O
them O
, O
because O
they O
can O
only O
be O
understood O
with O
the O
Spirit O
's O
help O
. O

We O
who O
have O
the O
Spirit O
are O
able O
to O
make O
judgments O
about O
all O
these O
things O
. O

But O
anyone O
without O
the O
Spirit O
is O
not O
able O
to O
make O
proper O
judgments O
about O
us O
. O

As O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
Who O
can O
know O
what O
is O
on O
the O
Lord O
's O
mind O
? O

Who O
is O
able O
to O
give O
him O
advice O
? O
'' O

But O
we O
have O
been O
given O
Christ O
's O
way O
of O
thinking O
. O

When O
one O
of O
you O
has O
something O
against O
someone O
else O
in O
your O
group O
, O
why O
do O
you O
go O
to O
the O
judges O
in O
the O
law O
courts O
? O

The O
way O
they O
think O
and O
live O
is O
wrong O
. O

So O
why O
do O
you O
let O
them O
decide O
who O
is O
right O
? O

Why O
do O
n't O
you O
let O
God O
's O
holy O
people O
decide O
who O
is O
right O
? O

Do O
n't O
you O
know O
that O
God O
's O
people O
will O
judge O
the O
world O
? O

So O
if O
you O
will O
judge O
the O
world O
, O
then O
surely O
you O
can O
judge O
small O
arguments O
like O
this O
. O

You O
know O
that O
in O
the O
future O
we O
will O
judge O
angels O
. O

So O
surely O
we O
can O
judge O
life O
's O
ordinary O
problems O
. O

So O
if O
you O
have O
such O
matters O
to O
be O
judged O
, O
why O
do O
you O
take O
them O
to O
those O
who O
are O
not O
part O
of O
the O
church O
? O

They O
mean O
nothing O
to O
you O
. O

I O
say O
this O
to O
shame O
you O
. O

Surely O
there O
is O
someone O
in O
your O
group O
wise O
enough O
to O
judge O
a O
complaint O
between O
two O
believers O
. O

But O
now O
one O
believer O
goes O
to O
court O
against O
another O
, O
and O
you O
let O
people O
who O
are O
not O
believers O
judge O
their O
case O
! O

The O
lawsuits O
that O
you O
have O
against O
each O
other O
show O
that O
you O
are O
already O
defeated O
. O

It O
would O
be O
better O
for O
you O
to O
let O
someone O
wrong O
you O
. O

It O
would O
be O
better O
to O
let O
someone O
cheat O
you O
. O

But O
you O
are O
the O
ones O
doing O
wrong O
and O
cheating O
. O

And O
you O
do O
this O
to O
your O
own O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
in O
Christ O
! O

Surely O
you O
know O
that O
people O
who O
do O
wrong O
will O
not O
get O
to O
enjoy O
God O
's O
kingdom O
. O

Do O
n't O
be O
fooled O
. O

These O
are O
the O
people O
who O
will O
not O
get O
to O
enjoy O
his O
kingdom O
: O
those O
who O
sin O
sexually O
, O
those O
who O
worship O
idols O
, O
those O
who O
commit O
adultery O
, O
men O
who O
let O
other O
men O
use O
them O
for O
sex O
or O
who O
have O
sex O
with O
other O
men O
, O
those O
who O
steal O
, O
those O
who O
are O
greedy O
, O
those O
who O
drink O
too O
much O
, O
those O
who O
abuse O
others O
with O
insults O
, O
and O
those O
who O
cheat O
. O

In O
the O
past O
some O
of O
you O
were O
like O
that O
. O

But O
you O
were O
washed O
clean O
, O
you O
were O
made O
holy O
, O
and O
you O
were O
made O
right O
with O
God O
in O
the O
name O
of O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
and O
by O
the O
Spirit O
of O
our O
God O
. O

`` O
I O
am O
allowed O
to O
do O
anything O
, O
'' O
you O
say O
. O

My O
answer O
to O
this O
is O
that O
not O
all O
things O
are O
good O
. O

Even O
if O
it O
is O
true O
that O
`` O
I O
am O
allowed O
to O
do O
anything O
, O
'' O
I O
will O
not O
let O
anything O
control O
me O
like O
a O
slave O
. O

Someone O
else O
says O
, O
`` O
Food O
is O
for O
the O
stomach O
, O
and O
the O
stomach O
for O
food O
. O
'' O

Yes O
, O
and O
God O
will O
destroy O
them O
both O
. O

But O
the O
body O
is O
not O
for O
sexual O
sin O
. O

The O
body O
is O
for O
the O
Lord O
, O
and O
the O
Lord O
is O
for O
the O
body O
. O

And O
God O
will O
raise O
our O
bodies O
from O
death O
with O
the O
same O
power O
he O
used O
to O
raise O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
. O

Surely O
you O
know O
that O
your O
bodies O
are O
parts O
of O
Christ O
himself O
. O

So O
I O
must O
never O
take O
what O
is O
part O
of O
Christ O
and O
join O
it O
to O
a O
prostitute O
! O

The O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
The O
two O
people O
will O
become O
one O
. O
'' O

So O
you O
should O
know O
that O
anyone O
who O
is O
joined O
with O
a O
prostitute O
becomes O
one O
with O
her O
in O
body O
. O

But O
anyone O
who O
is O
joined O
with O
the O
Lord O
is O
one O
with O
him O
in O
spirit O
. O

So O
run O
away O
from O
sexual O
sin O
. O

It O
involves O
the O
body O
in O
a O
way O
that O
no O
other O
sin O
does O
. O

So O
if O
you O
commit O
sexual O
sin O
, O
you O
are O
sinning O
against O
your O
own O
body O
. O

You O
should O
know O
that O
your O
body O
is O
a O
temple O
for O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
that O
you O
received O
from O
God O
and O
that O
lives O
in O
you O
. O

You O
do O
n't O
own O
yourselves O
. O

God O
paid O
a O
very O
high O
price O
to O
make O
you O
his O
. O

So O
honor O
God O
with O
your O
body O
. O

Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
when O
I O
was O
there O
, O
I O
could O
not O
talk O
to O
you O
the O
way O
I O
talk O
to O
people O
who O
are O
led O
by O
the O
Spirit O
. O

I O
had O
to O
talk O
to O
you O
like O
ordinary O
people O
of O
the O
world O
. O

You O
were O
like O
babies O
in O
Christ O
. O

And O
the O
teaching O
I O
gave O
you O
was O
like O
milk O
, O
not O
solid O
food O
. O

I O
did O
this O
because O
you O
were O
not O
ready O
for O
solid O
food O
. O

And O
even O
now O
you O
are O
not O
ready O
. O

You O
are O
still O
not O
following O
the O
Spirit O
. O

You O
are O
jealous O
of O
each O
other O
, O
and O
you O
are O
always O
arguing O
with O
each O
other O
. O

This O
shows O
that O
you O
are O
still O
following O
your O
own O
selfish O
desires O
. O

You O
are O
acting O
like O
ordinary O
people O
of O
the O
world O
. O

One O
of O
you O
says O
, O
`` O
I O
follow O
Paul O
, O
'' O
and O
someone O
else O
says O
, O
`` O
I O
follow O
Apollos O
. O
'' O

When O
you O
say O
things O
like O
that O
, O
you O
are O
acting O
like O
people O
of O
the O
world O
. O

Is O
Apollos O
so O
important O
? O

Is O
Paul O
so O
important O
? O

We O
are O
only O
servants O
of O
God O
who O
helped O
you O
believe O
. O

Each O
one O
of O
us O
did O
the O
work O
God O
gave O
us O
to O
do O
. O

I O
planted O
the O
seed O
and O
Apollos O
watered O
it O
. O

But O
God O
is O
the O
one O
who O
made O
the O
seed O
grow O
. O

So O
the O
one O
who O
plants O
is O
not O
important O
, O
and O
the O
one O
who O
waters O
is O
not O
important O
. O

Only O
God O
is O
important O
, O
because O
he O
is O
the O
one O
who O
makes O
things O
grow O
. O

The O
one O
who O
plants O
and O
the O
one O
who O
waters O
have O
the O
same O
purpose O
. O

And O
each O
one O
will O
be O
rewarded O
for O
his O
own O
work O
. O

We O
are O
workers O
together O
for O
God O
, O
and O
you O
are O
like O
a O
farm O
that O
belongs O
to O
God O
. O

And O
you O
are O
a O
house O
that O
belongs O
to O
God O
. O

Like O
an O
expert O
builder O
I O
built O
the O
foundation O
of O
that O
house O
. O

I O
used O
the O
gift O
that O
God O
gave O
me O
to O
do O
this O
. O

Other O
people O
are O
building O
on O
that O
foundation O
. O

But O
everyone O
should O
be O
careful O
how O
they O
build O
. O

The O
foundation O
that O
has O
already O
been O
built O
is O
Jesus O
Christ O
, O
and O
no O
one O
can O
build O
any O
other O
foundation O
. O

People O
can O
build O
on O
that O
foundation O
using O
gold O
, O
silver O
, O
jewels O
, O
wood O
, O
grass O
, O
or O
straw O
. O

But O
the O
work O
that O
each O
person O
does O
will O
be O
clearly O
seen O
, O
because O
the O
Day O
will O
make O
it O
plain O
. O

That O
Day O
will O
appear O
with O
fire O
, O
and O
the O
fire O
will O
test O
everyone O
's O
work O
. O

If O
the O
building O
they O
put O
on O
the O
foundation O
still O
stands O
, O
they O
will O
get O
their O
reward O
. O

But O
if O
their O
building O
is O
burned O
up O
, O
they O
will O
suffer O
loss O
. O

They O
will O
be O
saved O
, O
but O
it O
will O
be O
like O
someone O
escaping O
from O
a O
fire O
. O

You O
should O
know O
that O
you O
yourselves O
are O
God O
's O
temple O
. O

God O
's O
Spirit O
lives O
in O
you O
. O

If O
you O
destroy O
God O
's O
temple O
, O
God O
will O
destroy O
you O
, O
because O
God O
's O
temple O
is O
holy O
. O

You O
yourselves O
are O
God O
's O
temple O
. O

Do O
n't O
fool O
yourselves O
. O

Whoever O
thinks O
they O
are O
wise O
in O
this O
world O
should O
become O
a O
fool O
. O

That O
's O
the O
only O
way O
they O
can O
be O
wise O
. O

I O
say O
this O
because O
the O
wisdom O
of O
this O
world O
is O
foolishness O
to O
God O
. O

As O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
He O
catches O
those O
who O
think O
they O
are O
wise O
in O
their O
own O
clever O
traps O
. O
'' O

The O
Scriptures O
also O
say O
, O
`` O
The O
Lord O
knows O
the O
thoughts O
of O
the O
wise O
. O

He O
knows O
that O
their O
thoughts O
are O
worth O
nothing O
. O
'' O

So O
there O
is O
not O
a O
person O
on O
earth O
that O
any O
of O
you O
should O
be O
boasting O
about O
. O

Everything O
is O
yours O
: O
Paul O
, O
Apollos O
, O
Peter O
, O
the O
world O
, O
life O
, O
death O
, O
the O
present O
, O
and O
the O
future O
-- O
all O
these O
are O
yours O
. O

And O
you O
belong O
to O
Christ O
, O
and O
Christ O
belongs O
to O
God O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
believe O
what O
I O
am O
hearing O
-- O

that O
there O
is O
sexual O
sin O
among O
you O
. O

And O
it O
is O
such O
a O
bad O
kind O
of O
sexual O
sin O
that O
even O
those O
who O
have O
never O
known O
God O
do O
n't O
allow O
it O
. O

People O
say O
that O
a O
man O
there O
has O
his O
father O
's O
wife O
. O

And O
still O
you O
are O
proud O
of O
yourselves O
! O

You O
should O
have O
been O
filled O
with O
sadness O
. O

And O
the O
man O
who O
committed O
that O
sin O
should O
be O
put O
out O
of O
your O
group O
. O

I O
can O
not O
be O
there O
with O
you O
in O
person O
, O
but O
I O
am O
with O
you O
in O
spirit O
. O

And O
I O
have O
already O
judged O
the O
man O
who O
did O
this O
. O

I O
judged O
him O
the O
same O
as O
I O
would O
if O
I O
were O
really O
there O
. O

Come O
together O
in O
the O
name O
of O
our O
Lord O
Jesus O
. O

I O
will O
be O
with O
you O
in O
spirit O
, O
and O
you O
will O
have O
the O
power O
of O
our O
Lord O
Jesus O
with O
you O
. O

Then O
turn O
this O
man O
over O
to O
Satan O
. O

His O
sinful O
self O
has O
to O
be O
destroyed O
so O
that O
his O
spirit O
will O
be O
saved O
on O
the O
day O
when O
the O
Lord O
comes O
again O
. O

Your O
proud O
talk O
is O
not O
good O
. O

You O
know O
the O
saying O
, O
`` O
Just O
a O
little O
yeast O
makes O
the O
whole O
batch O
of O
dough O
rise O
. O
'' O

Take O
out O
all O
the O
old O
yeast O
, O
so O
that O
you O
will O
be O
a O
new O
batch O
of O
dough O
. O

You O
really O
are O
bread O
without O
yeast O
-- O
Passover O
bread O
. O

Yes O
, O
Christ O
our O
Passover O
Lamb O
has O
already O
been O
killed O
. O

So O
let O
us O
eat O
our O
Passover O
meal O
, O
but O
not O
with O
the O
bread O
that O
has O
the O
old O
yeast O
, O
the O
yeast O
of O
sin O
and O
wrongdoing O
. O

But O
let O
us O
eat O
the O
bread O
that O
has O
no O
yeast O
. O

This O
is O
the O
bread O
of O
goodness O
and O
truth O
. O

I O
wrote O
to O
you O
in O
my O
letter O
that O
you O
should O
not O
associate O
with O
people O
who O
sin O
sexually O
. O

But O
I O
did O
not O
mean O
the O
people O
of O
this O
world O
. O

You O
would O
have O
to O
leave O
the O
world O
to O
get O
away O
from O
all O
the O
people O
who O
sin O
sexually O
, O
or O
who O
are O
greedy O
and O
cheat O
each O
other O
, O
or O
who O
worship O
idols O
. O

I O
meant O
you O
must O
not O
associate O
with O
people O
who O
claim O
to O
be O
believers O
but O
continue O
to O
live O
in O
sin O
. O

Do O
n't O
even O
eat O
with O
a O
brother O
or O
sister O
who O
sins O
sexually O
, O
is O
greedy O
, O
worships O
idols O
, O
abuses O
others O
with O
insults O
, O
gets O
drunk O
, O
or O
cheats O
people O
. O

It O
is O
not O
my O
business O
to O
judge O
those O
who O
are O
not O
part O
of O
the O
group O
of O
believers O
. O

God O
will O
judge O
them O
, O
but O
you O
must O
judge O
those O
who O
are O
part O
of O
your O
group O
. O

The O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
Make O
the O
evil O
person O
leave O
your O
group O
. O
'' O

Now O
, O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
I O
want O
you O
to O
understand O
about O
spiritual O
gifts O
. O

You O
remember O
the O
lives O
you O
lived O
before O
you O
were O
believers O
. O

You O
let O
yourselves O
be O
influenced O
and O
led O
away O
to O
worship O
idols O
-- O
things O
that O
have O
no O
life O
. O

So O
I O
tell O
you O
that O
no O
one O
who O
is O
speaking O
with O
the O
help O
of O
God O
's O
Spirit O
says O
, O
`` O
Jesus O
be O
cursed O
. O
'' O

And O
no O
one O
can O
say O
, O
`` O
Jesus O
is O
Lord O
, O
'' O
without O
the O
help O
of O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
. O

There O
are O
different O
kinds O
of O
spiritual O
gifts O
, O
but O
they O
are O
all O
from O
the O
same O
Spirit O
. O

There O
are O
different O
ways O
to O
serve O
, O
but O
we O
serve O
the O
same O
Lord O
. O

And O
there O
are O
different O
ways O
that O
God O
works O
in O
people O
, O
but O
it O
is O
the O
same O
God O
who O
works O
in O
all O
of O
us O
to O
do O
everything O
. O

Something O
from O
the O
Spirit O
can O
be O
seen O
in O
each O
person O
. O

The O
Spirit O
gives O
this O
to O
each O
one O
to O
help O
others O
. O

The O
Spirit O
gives O
one O
person O
the O
ability O
to O
speak O
with O
wisdom O
. O

And O
the O
same O
Spirit O
gives O
another O
person O
the O
ability O
to O
speak O
with O
knowledge O
. O

The O
same O
Spirit O
gives O
faith O
to O
one O
person O
and O
to O
another O
he O
gives O
gifts O
of O
healing O
. O

The O
Spirit O
gives O
to O
one O
person O
the O
power O
to O
do O
miracles O
, O
to O
another O
the O
ability O
to O
prophesy O
, O
and O
to O
another O
the O
ability O
to O
judge O
what O
is O
from O
the O
Spirit O
and O
what O
is O
not O
. O

The O
Spirit O
gives O
one O
person O
the O
ability O
to O
speak O
in O
different O
kinds O
of O
languages O
, O
and O
to O
another O
the O
ability O
to O
interpret O
those O
languages O
. O

One O
Spirit O
, O
the O
same O
Spirit O
, O
does O
all O
these O
things O
. O

The O
Spirit O
decides O
what O
to O
give O
each O
one O
. O

A O
person O
has O
only O
one O
body O
, O
but O
it O
has O
many O
parts O
. O

Yes O
, O
there O
are O
many O
parts O
, O
but O
all O
those O
parts O
are O
still O
just O
one O
body O
. O

Christ O
is O
like O
that O
too O
. O

Some O
of O
us O
are O
Jews O
and O
some O
of O
us O
are O
not O
; O
some O
of O
us O
are O
slaves O
and O
some O
of O
us O
are O
free O
. O

But O
we O
were O
all O
baptized O
to O
become O
one O
body O
through O
one O
Spirit O
. O

And O
we O
were O
all O
given O
the O
one O
Spirit O
. O

And O
a O
person O
's O
body O
has O
more O
than O
one O
part O
. O

It O
has O
many O
parts O
. O

The O
foot O
might O
say O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
not O
a O
hand O
, O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
belong O
to O
the O
body O
. O
'' O

But O
saying O
this O
would O
not O
stop O
the O
foot O
from O
being O
a O
part O
of O
the O
body O
. O

The O
ear O
might O
say O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
not O
an O
eye O
, O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
belong O
to O
the O
body O
. O
'' O

But O
saying O
this O
would O
not O
make O
the O
ear O
stop O
being O
a O
part O
of O
the O
body O
. O

If O
the O
whole O
body O
were O
an O
eye O
, O
it O
would O
not O
be O
able O
to O
hear O
. O

If O
the O
whole O
body O
were O
an O
ear O
, O
it O
would O
not O
be O
able O
to O
smell O
anything O
. O

If O
each O
part O
of O
the O
body O
were O
the O
same O
part O
, O
there O
would O
be O
no O
body O
. O

But O
as O
it O
is O
, O
God O
put O
the O
parts O
in O
the O
body O
as O
he O
wanted O
them O
. O

He O
made O
a O
place O
for O
each O
one O
. O

So O
there O
are O
many O
parts O
, O
but O
only O
one O
body O
. O

The O
eye O
can O
not O
say O
to O
the O
hand O
, O
`` O
I O
do O
n't O
need O
you O
! O
'' O

And O
the O
head O
can O
not O
say O
to O
the O
foot O
, O
`` O
I O
do O
n't O
need O
you O
! O
'' O

No O
, O
those O
parts O
of O
the O
body O
that O
seem O
to O
be O
weaker O
are O
really O
very O
important O
. O

And O
the O
parts O
that O
we O
think O
are O
not O
worth O
very O
much O
are O
the O
parts O
we O
give O
the O
most O
care O
to O
. O

And O
we O
give O
special O
care O
to O
the O
parts O
of O
the O
body O
that O
we O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
show O
. O

The O
more O
beautiful O
parts O
do O
n't O
need O
this O
special O
care O
. O

But O
God O
put O
the O
body O
together O
and O
gave O
more O
honor O
to O
the O
parts O
that O
need O
it O
. O

God O
did O
this O
so O
that O
our O
body O
would O
not O
be O
divided O
. O

God O
wanted O
the O
different O
parts O
to O
care O
the O
same O
for O
each O
other O
. O

If O
one O
part O
of O
the O
body O
suffers O
, O
then O
all O
the O
other O
parts O
suffer O
with O
it O
. O

Or O
if O
one O
part O
is O
honored O
, O
then O
all O
the O
other O
parts O
share O
its O
honor O
. O

All O
of O
you O
together O
are O
the O
body O
of O
Christ O
. O

Each O
one O
of O
you O
is O
a O
part O
of O
that O
body O
. O

And O
in O
the O
church O
God O
has O
given O
a O
place O
first O
to O
apostles O
, O
second O
to O
prophets O
, O
and O
third O
to O
teachers O
. O

Then O
God O
has O
given O
a O
place O
to O
those O
who O
do O
miracles O
, O
those O
who O
have O
gifts O
of O
healing O
, O
those O
who O
can O
help O
others O
, O
those O
who O
are O
able O
to O
lead O
, O
and O
those O
who O
can O
speak O
in O
different O
kinds O
of O
languages O
. O

Not O
all O
are O
apostles O
. O

Not O
all O
are O
prophets O
. O

Not O
all O
are O
teachers O
. O

Not O
all O
do O
miracles O
. O

Not O
all O
have O
gifts O
of O
healing O
. O

Not O
all O
speak O
in O
different O
kinds O
of O
languages O
. O

Not O
all O
interpret O
those O
languages O
. O

Continue O
to O
give O
your O
attention O
to O
the O
spiritual O
gifts O
you O
consider O
to O
be O
the O
greatest O
. O

But O
now O
I O
want O
to O
point O
out O
a O
way O
of O
life O
that O
is O
even O
greater O
. O

You O
should O
think O
of O
us O
as O
servants O
of O
Christ O
, O
the O
ones O
God O
has O
trusted O
to O
do O
the O
work O
of O
making O
known O
his O
secret O
truths O
. O

Those O
who O
are O
trusted O
with O
such O
an O
important O
work O
must O
show O
that O
they O
are O
worthy O
of O
that O
trust O
. O

But O
I O
do O
n't O
consider O
your O
judgment O
on O
this O
point O
to O
be O
worth O
anything O
. O

Even O
an O
opinion O
from O
a O
court O
of O
law O
would O
mean O
nothing O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
even O
trust O
my O
own O
judgment O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
of O
any O
wrong O
I O
have O
done O
, O
but O
that O
does O
not O
make O
me O
right O
. O

The O
Lord O
is O
the O
one O
who O
must O
decide O
if O
I O
have O
done O
well O
or O
not O
. O

So O
do O
n't O
judge O
anyone O
now O
. O

The O
time O
for O
judging O
will O
be O
when O
the O
Lord O
comes O
. O

He O
will O
shine O
light O
on O
everything O
that O
is O
now O
hidden O
in O
darkness O
. O

He O
will O
make O
known O
the O
secret O
purposes O
of O
our O
hearts O
. O

Then O
the O
praise O
each O
person O
should O
get O
will O
come O
from O
God O
. O

Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
I O
have O
used O
Apollos O
and O
myself O
as O
examples O
for O
you O
. O

I O
did O
this O
so O
that O
you O
could O
learn O
from O
us O
the O
meaning O
of O
the O
words O
, O
`` O
Follow O
what O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
. O
'' O

Then O
you O
will O
not O
brag O
about O
one O
person O
and O
criticize O
another O
. O

Who O
do O
you O
think O
you O
are O
? O

Everything O
you O
have O
was O
given O
to O
you O
. O

So O
, O
if O
everything O
you O
have O
was O
given O
to O
you O
, O
why O
do O
you O
act O
as O
if O
you O
got O
it O
all O
by O
your O
own O
power O
? O

You O
think O
you O
have O
everything O
you O
need O
. O

You O
think O
you O
are O
rich O
. O

You O
think O
you O
have O
become O
kings O
without O
us O
. O

I O
wish O
you O
really O
were O
kings O
. O

Then O
we O
could O
rule O
together O
with O
you O
. O

But O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
God O
has O
given O
me O
and O
the O
other O
apostles O
the O
last O
place O
. O

We O
are O
like O
prisoners O
condemned O
to O
die O
, O
led O
in O
a O
parade O
for O
the O
whole O
world O
to O
see O
-- O
not O
just O
people O
but O
angels O
too O
. O

We O
are O
fools O
for O
Christ O
, O
but O
you O
think O
you O
are O
so O
wise O
in O
Christ O
. O

We O
are O
weak O
, O
but O
you O
think O
you O
are O
so O
strong O
. O

People O
give O
you O
honor O
, O
but O
they O
do O
n't O
honor O
us O
. O

Even O
now O
we O
still O
do O
n't O
have O
enough O
to O
eat O
or O
drink O
, O
and O
we O
do O
n't O
have O
enough O
clothes O
. O

We O
often O
get O
beatings O
. O

We O
have O
no O
homes O
. O

We O
work O
hard O
with O
our O
own O
hands O
to O
feed O
ourselves O
. O

When O
people O
insult O
us O
, O
we O
ask O
God O
to O
bless O
them O
. O

When O
people O
treat O
us O
badly O
, O
we O
accept O
it O
. O

When O
people O
say O
bad O
things O
about O
us O
, O
we O
try O
to O
say O
something O
that O
will O
help O
them O
. O

But O
people O
still O
treat O
us O
like O
the O
world O
's O
garbage O
-- O
everyone O
's O
trash O
. O

I O
am O
not O
trying O
to O
make O
you O
feel O
ashamed O
, O
but O
I O
am O
writing O
this O
to O
counsel O
you O
as O
my O
own O
dear O
children O
. O

You O
may O
have O
ten O
thousand O
teachers O
in O
Christ O
, O
but O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
many O
fathers O
. O

Through O
the O
Good O
News O
I O
became O
your O
father O
in O
Christ O
Jesus O
. O

So O
I O
beg O
you O
to O
be O
like O
me O
. O

That O
is O
why O
I O
am O
sending O
Timothy O
to O
you O
. O

He O
is O
my O
son O
in O
the O
Lord O
. O

I O
love O
him O
and O
trust O
him O
. O

He O
will O
help O
you O
remember O
the O
way O
I O
live O
in O
Christ O
Jesus O
-- O
a O
way O
of O
life O
that O
I O
teach O
in O
all O
the O
churches O
everywhere O
. O

Some O
of O
you O
are O
acting O
so O
proud O
, O
it O
seems O
as O
though O
you O
think O
I O
wo O
n't O
be O
coming O
there O
again O
. O

But O
I O
will O
come O
to O
you O
very O
soon O
, O
the O
Lord O
willing O
. O

Then O
I O
will O
see O
if O
these O
proud O
talkers O
have O
the O
power O
to O
do O
anything O
more O
than O
talk O
. O

God O
's O
kingdom O
is O
not O
seen O
in O
talk O
but O
in O
power O
. O

Which O
do O
you O
want O
: O
that O
I O
come O
to O
you O
with O
punishment O
, O
or O
that O
I O
come O
with O
love O
and O
gentleness O
? O

Now O
, O
about O
the O
collection O
of O
money O
for O
God O
's O
people O
: O
Do O
the O
same O
as O
I O
told O
the O
Galatian O
churches O
to O
do O
. O

On O
the O
first O
day O
of O
every O
week O
, O
each O
of O
you O
should O
take O
some O
of O
your O
money O
and O
put O
it O
in O
a O
special O
place O
. O

Save O
up O
as O
much O
as O
you O
can O
from O
what O
you O
are O
blessed O
with O
. O

Then O
you O
will O
not O
have O
to O
gather O
it O
all O
after O
I O
come O
. O

When O
I O
arrive O
, O
I O
will O
send O
some O
men O
to O
take O
your O
gift O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

These O
will O
be O
the O
ones O
you O
all O
agree O
should O
go O
. O

I O
will O
send O
them O
with O
letters O
of O
introduction O
. O

If O
it O
seems O
good O
for O
me O
to O
go O
too O
, O
we O
can O
all O
travel O
together O
. O

I O
plan O
to O
go O
through O
Macedonia O
, O
so O
I O
will O
come O
to O
you O
after O
that O
. O

Maybe O
I O
will O
stay O
with O
you O
for O
a O
time O
. O

I O
might O
even O
stay O
all O
winter O
. O

Then O
you O
can O
help O
me O
on O
my O
trip O
, O
wherever O
I O
go O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
come O
see O
you O
now O
, O
because O
I O
would O
have O
to O
leave O
to O
go O
to O
other O
places O
. O

I O
hope O
to O
stay O
a O
longer O
time O
with O
you O
, O
if O
the O
Lord O
allows O
it O
. O

But O
I O
will O
stay O
in O
Ephesus O
until O
Pentecost O
. O

I O
will O
stay O
here O
, O
because O
a O
good O
opportunity O
for O
a O
great O
and O
growing O
work O
has O
been O
given O
to O
me O
now O
. O

And O
there O
are O
many O
people O
working O
against O
it O
. O

Timothy O
might O
come O
to O
you O
. O

Try O
to O
make O
him O
feel O
comfortable O
with O
you O
. O

He O
is O
working O
for O
the O
Lord O
the O
same O
as O
I O
am O
. O

So O
none O
of O
you O
should O
refuse O
to O
accept O
Timothy O
. O

Help O
him O
continue O
on O
his O
trip O
in O
peace O
so O
that O
he O
can O
come O
back O
to O
me O
. O

I O
am O
expecting O
him O
to O
come O
back O
with O
the O
other O
brothers O
. O

Now O
about O
our O
brother O
Apollos O
: O
I O
strongly O
encouraged O
him O
to O
visit O
you O
with O
the O
other O
brothers O
. O

He O
prefers O
not O
to O
come O
now O
, O
but O
he O
will O
come O
when O
he O
has O
the O
opportunity O
. O

Be O
careful O
. O

Hold O
firmly O
to O
your O
faith O
. O

Have O
courage O
and O
be O
strong O
. O

Do O
everything O
in O
love O
. O

You O
know O
that O
Stephanas O
and O
his O
family O
were O
the O
first O
believers O
in O
Achaia O
. O

They O
have O
given O
themselves O
to O
the O
service O
of O
God O
's O
people O
. O

I O
ask O
you O
, O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
to O
follow O
the O
leading O
of O
people O
like O
these O
and O
others O
who O
work O
hard O
and O
serve O
together O
with O
them O
. O

I O
am O
happy O
that O
Stephanas O
, O
Fortunatus O
, O
and O
Achaicus O
have O
come O
. O

You O
are O
not O
here O
, O
but O
they O
have O
filled O
your O
place O
. O

They O
have O
been O
a O
great O
encouragement O
to O
me O
and O
to O
you O
as O
well O
. O

You O
should O
recognize O
the O
value O
of O
such O
people O
. O

The O
churches O
in O
Asia O
send O
you O
their O
greetings O
. O

Aquila O
and O
Priscilla O
greet O
you O
in O
the O
Lord O
. O

Also O
the O
church O
that O
meets O
in O
their O
house O
sends O
greetings O
. O

All O
the O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
send O
their O
greetings O
. O

Give O
each O
other O
the O
special O
greeting O
of O
God O
's O
people O
. O

Here O
's O
my O
greeting O
in O
my O
own O
handwriting O
-- O
Paul O
. O

If O
anyone O
does O
not O
love O
the O
Lord O
, O
let O
that O
person O
be O
separated O
from O
God O
-- O
lost O
forever O
! O

Come O
, O
O O
Lord O
! O

The O
grace O
of O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
be O
with O
you O
. O

My O
love O
be O
with O
all O
of O
you O
in O
Christ O
Jesus O
. O

Now O
I O
will O
write O
about O
meat O
that O
is O
sacrificed O
to O
idols O
. O

We O
know O
that O
`` O
we O
all O
have O
knowledge O
, O
'' O
as O
you O
say O
. O

But O
this O
knowledge O
puffs O
a O
person O
up O
with O
pride O
, O
while O
love O
helps O
the O
church O
grow O
stronger O
. O

Whoever O
thinks O
they O
know O
something O
does O
not O
yet O
know O
anything O
as O
they O
should O
. O

But O
whoever O
loves O
God O
is O
known O
by O
God O
. O

So O
this O
is O
what O
I O
say O
about O
eating O
meat O
: O
We O
know O
that O
an O
idol O
is O
really O
nothing O
in O
the O
world O
, O
and O
we O
know O
that O
there O
is O
only O
one O
God O
. O

It O
's O
really O
not O
important O
if O
there O
are O
things O
called O
gods O
in O
heaven O
or O
on O
earth O
-- O
and O
there O
are O
many O
of O
these O
`` O

gods O
'' O
and O
`` O
lords O
'' O
out O
there O
. O

For O
us O
there O
is O
only O
one O
God O
, O
and O
he O
is O
our O
Father O
. O

All O
things O
came O
from O
him O
, O
and O
we O
live O
for O
him O
. O

And O
there O
is O
only O
one O
Lord O
, O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

All O
things O
were O
made O
through O
him O
, O
and O
we O
also O
have O
life O
through O
him O
. O

But O
not O
all O
people O
know O
this O
. O

Some O
have O
had O
the O
habit O
of O
worshiping O
idols O
. O

So O
now O
when O
they O
eat O
meat O
, O
they O
still O
feel O
as O
if O
it O
belongs O
to O
an O
idol O
. O

They O
are O
not O
sure O
that O
it O
is O
right O
to O
eat O
this O
meat O
. O

So O
when O
they O
eat O
it O
, O
they O
feel O
guilty O
. O

But O
food O
will O
not O
bring O
us O
closer O
to O
God O
. O

Refusing O
to O
eat O
does O
not O
make O
us O
less O
pleasing O
to O
God O
, O
and O
eating O
does O
not O
make O
us O
closer O
to O
him O
. O

But O
be O
careful O
with O
your O
freedom O
. O

Your O
freedom O
to O
eat O
anything O
may O
make O
those O
who O
have O
doubts O
about O
what O
they O
can O
eat O
fall O
into O
sin O
. O

You O
understand O
that O
it O
's O
all O
right O
to O
eat O
anything O
, O
so O
you O
can O
eat O
even O
in O
an O
idol O
's O
temple O
. O

But O
someone O
who O
has O
doubts O
might O
see O
you O
eating O
there O
, O
and O
this O
might O
encourage O
them O
to O
eat O
meat O
sacrificed O
to O
idols O
too O
. O

But O
they O
really O
think O
it O
is O
wrong O
. O

So O
this O
weak O
brother O
or O
sister O
-- O
someone O
Christ O
died O
for O
-- O
is O
lost O
because O
of O
your O
better O
understanding O
. O

When O
you O
sin O
against O
your O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
in O
Christ O
in O
this O
way O
and O
you O
hurt O
them O
by O
causing O
them O
to O
do O
things O
they O
feel O
are O
wrong O
, O
you O
are O
also O
sinning O
against O
Christ O
. O

So O
if O
the O
food O
I O
eat O
makes O
another O
believer O
fall O
into O
sin O
, O
I O
will O
never O
eat O
meat O
again O
. O

I O
will O
stop O
eating O
meat O
, O
so O
that O
I O
will O
not O
make O
my O
brother O
or O
sister O
sin O
. O

Now O
I O
will O
discuss O
the O
things O
you O
wrote O
me O
about O
. O

You O
asked O
if O
it O
is O
better O
for O
a O
man O
not O
to O
have O
any O
sexual O
relations O
at O
all O
. O

But O
sexual O
sin O
is O
a O
danger O
, O
so O
each O
man O
should O
enjoy O
his O
own O
wife O
, O
and O
each O
woman O
should O
enjoy O
her O
own O
husband O
. O

The O
husband O
should O
give O
his O
wife O
what O
she O
deserves O
as O
his O
wife O
. O

And O
the O
wife O
should O
give O
her O
husband O
what O
he O
deserves O
as O
her O
husband O
. O

The O
wife O
does O
not O
have O
power O
over O
her O
own O
body O
. O

Her O
husband O
has O
the O
power O
over O
her O
body O
. O

And O
the O
husband O
does O
not O
have O
power O
over O
his O
own O
body O
. O

His O
wife O
has O
the O
power O
over O
his O
body O
. O

Do O
n't O
refuse O
to O
give O
your O
bodies O
to O
each O
other O
. O

But O
you O
might O
both O
agree O
to O
stay O
away O
from O
sex O
for O
a O
while O
so O
that O
you O
can O
give O
your O
time O
to O
prayer O
. O

Then O
come O
together O
again O
so O
that O
Satan O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
tempt O
you O
in O
your O
weakness O
. O

I O
say O
this O
only O
to O
give O
you O
permission O
to O
be O
separated O
for O
a O
time O
. O

It O
is O
not O
a O
rule O
. O

I O
wish O
everyone O
could O
be O
like O
me O
. O

But O
God O
has O
given O
each O
person O
a O
different O
ability O
. O

He O
makes O
some O
able O
to O
live O
one O
way O
, O
others O
to O
live O
a O
different O
way O
. O

Now O
for O
those O
who O
are O
not O
married O
and O
for O
the O
widows O
I O
say O
this O
: O
It O
is O
good O
for O
you O
to O
stay O
single O
like O
me O
. O

But O
if O
you O
can O
not O
control O
your O
body O
, O
then O
you O
should O
marry O
. O

It O
is O
better O
to O
marry O
than O
to O
burn O
with O
sexual O
desire O
. O

Now O
, O
I O
have O
a O
command O
for O
those O
who O
are O
married O
. O

Actually O
, O
it O
is O
not O
from O
me O
; O
it O
is O
what O
the O
Lord O
commanded O
. O

A O
wife O
should O
not O
leave O
her O
husband O
. O

But O
if O
a O
wife O
does O
leave O
, O
she O
should O
remain O
single O
or O
get O
back O
together O
with O
her O
husband O
. O

And O
a O
husband O
should O
not O
divorce O
his O
wife O
. O

The O
advice O
I O
have O
for O
the O
others O
is O
from O
me O
. O

The O
Lord O
did O
not O
give O
us O
any O
teaching O
about O
this O
. O

If O
you O
have O
a O
wife O
who O
is O
not O
a O
believer O
, O
you O
should O
not O
divorce O
her O
if O
she O
will O
continue O
to O
live O
with O
you O
. O

And O
if O
you O
have O
a O
husband O
who O
is O
not O
a O
believer O
, O
you O
should O
not O
divorce O
him O
if O
he O
will O
continue O
to O
live O
with O
you O
. O

The O
husband O
who O
is O
not O
a O
believer O
is O
set O
apart O
for O
God O
through O
his O
believing O
wife O
. O

And O
the O
wife O
who O
is O
not O
a O
believer O
is O
set O
apart O
for O
God O
through O
her O
believing O
husband O
. O

If O
this O
were O
not O
true O
, O
your O
children O
would O
be O
unfit O
for O
God O
's O
use O
. O

But O
now O
they O
are O
set O
apart O
for O
him O
. O

But O
if O
the O
husband O
or O
wife O
who O
is O
not O
a O
believer O
decides O
to O
leave O
, O
let O
them O
leave O
. O

When O
this O
happens O
, O
the O
brother O
or O
sister O
in O
Christ O
is O
free O
. O

God O
chose O
you O
to O
have O
a O
life O
of O
peace O
. O

Wives O
, O
maybe O
you O
will O
save O
your O
husband O
; O
and O
husbands O
, O
maybe O
you O
will O
save O
your O
wife O
. O

You O
do O
n't O
know O
now O
what O
will O
happen O
later O
. O

But O
each O
one O
of O
you O
should O
continue O
to O
live O
the O
way O
the O
Lord O
God O
has O
given O
you O
to O
live O
-- O
the O
way O
you O
were O
when O
God O
chose O
you O
. O

This O
is O
a O
rule O
I O
make O
for O
all O
the O
churches O
. O

If O
a O
man O
was O
already O
circumcised O
when O
he O
was O
chosen O
, O
he O
should O
not O
change O
his O
circumcision O
. O

If O
a O
man O
was O
without O
circumcision O
when O
he O
was O
chosen O
, O
he O
should O
not O
be O
circumcised O
. O

It O
is O
not O
important O
if O
anyone O
is O
circumcised O
or O
not O
. O

What O
is O
important O
is O
obeying O
God O
's O
commands O
. O

Each O
one O
of O
you O
should O
stay O
the O
way O
you O
were O
when O
God O
chose O
you O
. O

If O
you O
were O
a O
slave O
when O
God O
chose O
you O
, O
do O
n't O
let O
that O
bother O
you O
. O

But O
if O
you O
can O
be O
free O
, O
then O
do O
it O
. O

If O
you O
were O
a O
slave O
when O
the O
Lord O
chose O
you O
, O
you O
are O
now O
free O
in O
the O
Lord O
. O

You O
belong O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

In O
the O
same O
way O
, O
if O
you O
were O
free O
when O
you O
were O
chosen O
, O
you O
are O
now O
Christ O
's O
slave O
. O

God O
paid O
a O
high O
price O
for O
you O
, O
so O
do O
n't O
be O
slaves O
to O
anyone O
else O
. O

Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
in O
your O
new O
life O
with O
God O
, O
each O
one O
of O
you O
should O
continue O
the O
way O
you O
were O
when O
God O
chose O
you O
. O

Now O
I O
write O
about O
people O
who O
are O
not O
married O
. O

I O
have O
no O
command O
from O
the O
Lord O
about O
this O
, O
but O
I O
give O
my O
opinion O
. O

And O
I O
can O
be O
trusted O
, O
because O
the O
Lord O
has O
given O
me O
mercy O
. O

This O
is O
a O
time O
of O
trouble O
. O

So O
I O
think O
it O
is O
good O
for O
you O
to O
stay O
the O
way O
you O
are O
. O

If O
you O
have O
a O
wife O
, O
do O
n't O
try O
to O
get O
free O
from O
her O
. O

If O
you O
are O
not O
married O
, O
do O
n't O
try O
to O
find O
a O
wife O
. O

But O
if O
you O
decide O
to O
marry O
, O
that O
is O
not O
a O
sin O
. O

And O
it O
is O
not O
a O
sin O
for O
a O
girl O
who O
has O
never O
married O
to O
get O
married O
. O

But O
those O
who O
marry O
will O
have O
trouble O
in O
this O
life O
, O
and O
I O
want O
you O
to O
be O
free O
from O
this O
trouble O
. O

Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
this O
is O
what O
I O
mean O
: O

We O
do O
n't O
have O
much O
time O
left O
. O

So O
starting O
now O
, O
those O
who O
have O
wives O
should O
be O
the O
same O
as O
those O
who O
do O
n't O
. O

It O
should O
not O
be O
important O
whether O
you O
are O
sad O
or O
whether O
you O
are O
happy O
. O

If O
you O
buy O
something O
, O
it O
should O
not O
matter O
to O
you O
that O
you O
own O
it O
. O

You O
should O
use O
the O
things O
of O
the O
world O
without O
letting O
them O
become O
important O
to O
you O
. O

This O
is O
how O
you O
should O
live O
, O
because O
this O
world O
, O
the O
way O
it O
is O
now O
, O
will O
soon O
be O
gone O
. O

I O
want O
you O
to O
be O
free O
from O
worry O
. O

A O
man O
who O
is O
not O
married O
is O
busy O
with O
the O
Lord O
's O
work O
. O

He O
is O
trying O
to O
please O
the O
Lord O
. O

But O
a O
man O
who O
is O
married O
is O
busy O
with O
things O
of O
the O
world O
. O

He O
is O
trying O
to O
please O
his O
wife O
. O

He O
must O
think O
about O
two O
things O
-- O
pleasing O
his O
wife O
and O
pleasing O
the O
Lord O
. O

A O
woman O
who O
is O
not O
married O
or O
a O
girl O
who O
has O
never O
married O
is O
busy O
with O
the O
Lord O
's O
work O
. O

She O
wants O
to O
give O
herself O
fully O
-- O
body O
and O
spirit O
-- O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

But O
a O
married O
woman O
is O
busy O
with O
things O
of O
the O
world O
. O

She O
is O
trying O
to O
please O
her O
husband O
. O

I O
am O
saying O
this O
to O
help O
you O
. O

I O
am O
not O
trying O
to O
limit O
you O
, O
but O
I O
want O
you O
to O
live O
in O
the O
right O
way O
. O

And O
I O
want O
you O
to O
give O
yourselves O
fully O
to O
the O
Lord O
without O
giving O
your O
time O
to O
other O
things O
. O

A O
man O
might O
think O
that O
he O
is O
not O
doing O
the O
right O
thing O
with O
his O
fiancee O
. O

She O
might O
be O
almost O
past O
the O
best O
age O
to O
marry O
. O

So O
he O
might O
feel O
that O
he O
should O
marry O
her O
. O

He O
should O
do O
what O
he O
wants O
. O

It O
is O
no O
sin O
for O
them O
to O
get O
married O
. O

But O
another O
man O
might O
be O
more O
sure O
in O
his O
mind O
. O

There O
may O
be O
no O
need O
for O
marriage O
, O
so O
he O
is O
free O
to O
do O
what O
he O
wants O
. O

If O
he O
has O
decided O
in O
his O
own O
heart O
not O
to O
marry O
his O
fiancee O
, O
he O
is O
doing O
the O
right O
thing O
. O

So O
the O
man O
who O
marries O
his O
fiancee O
does O
right O
, O
and O
the O
man O
who O
does O
not O
marry O
does O
better O
. O

A O
woman O
should O
stay O
with O
her O
husband O
as O
long O
as O
he O
lives O
. O

But O
if O
the O
husband O
dies O
, O
the O
woman O
is O
free O
to O
marry O
any O
man O
she O
wants O
, O
but O
he O
should O
belong O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

The O
woman O
is O
happier O
if O
she O
does O
not O
marry O
again O
. O

This O
is O
my O
opinion O
, O
and O
I O
believe O
that O
I O
have O
God O
's O
Spirit O
. O

Follow O
my O
example O
, O
just O
as O
I O
follow O
the O
example O
of O
Christ O
. O

I O
praise O
you O
because O
you O
remember O
me O
in O
all O
things O
. O

You O
follow O
closely O
the O
teachings O
I O
gave O
you O
. O

But O
I O
want O
you O
to O
understand O
this O
: O
The O
head O
of O
every O
man O
is O
Christ O
. O

And O
the O
head O
of O
a O
woman O
is O
the O
man O
. O

And O
the O
head O
of O
Christ O
is O
God O
. O

Every O
man O
who O
prophesies O
or O
prays O
with O
his O
head O
covered O
brings O
shame O
to O
his O
head O
. O

But O
every O
woman O
who O
prays O
or O
prophesies O
should O
have O
her O
head O
covered O
. O

If O
her O
head O
is O
not O
covered O
, O
she O
brings O
shame O
to O
her O
head O
. O

Then O
she O
is O
the O
same O
as O
a O
woman O
who O
has O
her O
head O
shaved O
. O

If O
a O
woman O
does O
not O
cover O
her O
head O
, O
it O
is O
the O
same O
as O
cutting O
off O
all O
her O
hair O
. O

But O
it O
is O
shameful O
for O
a O
woman O
to O
cut O
off O
her O
hair O
or O
to O
shave O
her O
head O
. O

So O
she O
should O
cover O
her O
head O
. O

But O
a O
man O
should O
not O
cover O
his O
head O
, O
because O
he O
is O
made O
like O
God O
and O
is O
God O
's O
glory O
. O

But O
woman O
is O
man O
's O
glory O
. O

Man O
did O
not O
come O
from O
woman O
. O

Woman O
came O
from O
man O
. O

And O
man O
was O
not O
made O
for O
woman O
. O

Woman O
was O
made O
for O
man O
. O

So O
that O
is O
why O
a O
woman O
should O
have O
her O
head O
covered O
with O
something O
that O
shows O
she O
is O
under O
authority O
. O

Also O
, O
she O
should O
do O
this O
because O
of O
the O
angels O
. O

But O
in O
the O
Lord O
the O
woman O
needs O
the O
man O
, O
and O
the O
man O
needs O
the O
woman O
. O

This O
is O
true O
because O
woman O
came O
from O
man O
, O
but O
also O
man O
is O
born O
from O
woman O
. O

Really O
, O
everything O
comes O
from O
God O
. O

Decide O
this O
for O
yourselves O
: O
Is O
it O
right O
for O
a O
woman O
to O
pray O
to O
God O
without O
something O
on O
her O
head O
? O

Even O
nature O
itself O
teaches O
you O
that O
wearing O
long O
hair O
is O
shameful O
for O
a O
man O
. O

But O
wearing O
long O
hair O
is O
a O
woman O
's O
honor O
. O

Long O
hair O
is O
given O
to O
the O
woman O
to O
cover O
her O
head O
. O

Some O
people O
may O
still O
want O
to O
argue O
about O
this O
. O

But O
we O
and O
the O
churches O
of O
God O
do O
n't O
accept O
what O
those O
people O
are O
doing O
. O

In O
the O
things O
I O
tell O
you O
now O
I O
do O
n't O
praise O
you O
. O

Your O
meetings O
hurt O
you O
more O
than O
they O
help O
you O
. O

First O
, O
I O
hear O
that O
when O
you O
meet O
together O
as O
a O
church O
you O
are O
divided O
. O

And O
this O
is O
not O
hard O
to O
believe O
because O
of O
your O
idea O
that O
you O
must O
have O
separate O
groups O
to O
show O
who O
the O
real O
believers O
are O
! O

When O
you O
all O
come O
together O
, O
it O
is O
not O
really O
the O
Lord O
's O
Supper O
you O
are O
eating O
. O

I O
say O
this O
because O
when O
you O
eat O
, O
each O
one O
eats O
without O
waiting O
for O
the O
others O
. O

Some O
people O
do O
n't O
get O
enough O
to O
eat O
or O
drink O
, O
while O
others O
have O
too O
much O
. O

You O
can O
eat O
and O
drink O
in O
your O
own O
homes O
. O

It O
seems O
that O
you O
think O
God O
's O
church O
is O
not O
important O
. O

You O
embarrass O
those O
who O
are O
poor O
. O

What O
can O
I O
say O
? O

Should O
I O
praise O
you O
? O

No O
, O
I O
can O
not O
praise O
you O
for O
this O
. O

The O
teaching O
I O
gave O
you O
is O
the O
same O
that O
I O
received O
from O
the O
Lord O
: O
On O
the O
night O
when O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
was O
handed O
over O
to O
be O
killed O
, O
he O
took O
bread O
and O
gave O
thanks O
for O
it O
. O

Then O
he O
divided O
the O
bread O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
This O
is O
my O
body O
; O
it O
is O
for O
you O
. O

Eat O
this O
to O
remember O
me O
. O
'' O

In O
the O
same O
way O
, O
after O
they O
ate O
, O
Jesus O
took O
the O
cup O
of O
wine O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
This O
cup O
represents O
the O
new O
agreement O
from O
God O
, O
which O
begins O
with O
my O
blood O
sacrifice O
. O

When O
you O
drink O
this O
, O
do O
it O
to O
remember O
me O
. O
'' O

This O
means O
that O
every O
time O
you O
eat O
this O
bread O
and O
drink O
this O
cup O
, O
you O
are O
telling O
others O
about O
the O
Lord O
's O
death O
until O
he O
comes O
again O
. O

So O
if O
you O
eat O
the O
bread O
or O
drink O
the O
cup O
of O
the O
Lord O
in O
a O
way O
that O
does O
not O
fit O
its O
meaning O
, O
you O
are O
sinning O
against O
the O
body O
and O
the O
blood O
of O
the O
Lord O
. O

Before O
you O
eat O
the O
bread O
and O
drink O
the O
cup O
, O
you O
should O
examine O
your O
own O
attitude O
. O

If O
you O
eat O
and O
drink O
without O
paying O
attention O
to O
those O
who O
are O
the O
Lord O
's O
body O
, O
your O
eating O
and O
drinking O
will O
cause O
you O
to O
be O
judged O
guilty O
. O

That O
is O
why O
many O
in O
your O
group O
are O
sick O
and O
weak O
, O
and O
many O
have O
died O
. O

But O
if O
we O
judged O
ourselves O
in O
the O
right O
way O
, O
then O
God O
would O
not O
judge O
us O
. O

But O
when O
the O
Lord O
judges O
us O
, O
he O
punishes O
us O
to O
show O
us O
the O
right O
way O
. O

He O
does O
this O
so O
that O
we O
will O
not O
be O
condemned O
with O
the O
world O
. O

So O
, O
my O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
when O
you O
come O
together O
to O
eat O
, O
wait O
for O
each O
other O
. O

If O
some O
are O
too O
hungry O
to O
wait O
, O
they O
should O
eat O
at O
home O
. O

Do O
this O
so O
that O
your O
meeting O
together O
will O
not O
bring O
God O
's O
judgment O
on O
you O
. O

I O
will O
tell O
you O
what O
to O
do O
about O
the O
other O
things O
when O
I O
come O
. O

Love O
should O
be O
the O
goal O
of O
your O
life O
, O
but O
you O
should O
also O
want O
to O
have O
the O
gifts O
that O
come O
from O
the O
Spirit O
. O

And O
the O
gift O
you O
should O
want O
most O
is O
to O
be O
able O
to O
prophesy O
. O

I O
will O
explain O
why O
. O

Those O
who O
have O
the O
gift O
of O
speaking O
in O
a O
different O
language O
are O
not O
speaking O
to O
people O
. O

They O
are O
speaking O
to O
God O
. O

No O
one O
understands O
them O
-- O
they O
are O
speaking O
secret O
things O
through O
the O
Spirit O
. O

But O
those O
who O
prophesy O
are O
speaking O
to O
people O
. O

They O
help O
people O
grow O
stronger O
in O
faith O
, O
and O
they O
give O
encouragement O
and O
comfort O
. O

Those O
who O
speak O
in O
a O
different O
language O
are O
helping O
only O
themselves O
. O

But O
those O
who O
prophesy O
are O
helping O
the O
whole O
church O
. O

I O
would O
like O
all O
of O
you O
to O
have O
the O
gift O
of O
speaking O
in O
different O
languages O
. O

But O
what O
I O
want O
more O
is O
for O
you O
to O
prophesy O
. O

Anyone O
who O
prophesies O
is O
more O
important O
than O
those O
who O
can O
only O
speak O
in O
different O
languages O
. O

However O
, O
if O
they O
can O
also O
interpret O
those O
languages O
, O
they O
are O
as O
important O
as O
the O
one O
who O
prophesies O
. O

If O
they O
can O
interpret O
, O
then O
the O
church O
can O
be O
helped O
by O
what O
they O
say O
. O

Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
will O
it O
help O
you O
if O
I O
come O
to O
you O
speaking O
in O
different O
languages O
? O

No O
, O
it O
will O
help O
you O
only O
if O
I O
bring O
you O
a O
new O
truth O
or O
some O
knowledge O
, O
prophecy O
, O
or O
teaching O
. O

This O
is O
true O
even O
with O
lifeless O
things O
that O
make O
sounds O
-- O
like O
a O
flute O
or O
a O
harp O
. O

If O
the O
different O
musical O
notes O
are O
not O
made O
clear O
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
understand O
what O
song O
is O
being O
played O
. O

Each O
note O
must O
be O
played O
clearly O
for O
you O
to O
be O
able O
to O
understand O
the O
tune O
. O

And O
in O
a O
war O
, O
if O
the O
trumpet O
does O
not O
sound O
clearly O
, O
the O
soldiers O
will O
not O
know O
it O
is O
time O
to O
prepare O
for O
fighting O
. O

It O
is O
the O
same O
with O
you O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
speak O
clearly O
in O
a O
language O
people O
know O
, O
they O
can O
not O
understand O
what O
you O
are O
saying O
. O

You O
will O
be O
talking O
to O
the O
air O
! O

It O
is O
true O
that O
there O
are O
many O
different O
languages O
in O
the O
world O
, O
and O
they O
all O
have O
meaning O
. O

But O
if O
I O
do O
n't O
understand O
the O
meaning O
of O
what O
someone O
is O
saying O
, O
it O
will O
just O
be O
strange O
sounds O
to O
me O
, O
and O
I O
will O
sound O
just O
as O
strange O
to O
them O
. O

That O
's O
why O
you O
who O
want O
spiritual O
gifts O
so O
much O
should O
prefer O
those O
gifts O
that O
help O
the O
church O
grow O
stronger O
. O

So O
those O
who O
have O
the O
gift O
of O
speaking O
in O
a O
different O
language O
should O
pray O
that O
they O
can O
also O
interpret O
what O
they O
say O
. O

If O
I O
pray O
in O
a O
different O
language O
, O
my O
spirit O
is O
praying O
, O
but O
my O
mind O
does O
nothing O
. O

So O
what O
should O
I O
do O
? O

I O
will O
pray O
with O
my O
spirit O
, O
but O
I O
will O
also O
pray O
with O
my O
mind O
. O

I O
will O
sing O
with O
my O
spirit O
, O
but O
I O
will O
also O
sing O
with O
my O
mind O
. O

You O
might O
be O
praising O
God O
with O
your O
spirit O
. O

But O
someone O
there O
without O
understanding O
can O
not O
say O
`` O
Amen O
'' O
to O
your O
prayer O
of O
thanks O
, O
because O
they O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
you O
are O
saying O
. O

You O
may O
be O
thanking O
God O
in O
a O
good O
way O
, O
but O
others O
are O
not O
helped O
. O

I O
thank O
God O
that O
my O
gift O
of O
speaking O
in O
different O
kinds O
of O
languages O
is O
greater O
than O
any O
of O
yours O
. O

But O
in O
the O
church O
meetings O
I O
would O
rather O
speak O
five O
words O
that O
I O
understand O
than O
thousands O
of O
words O
in O
a O
different O
language O
. O

I O
would O
rather O
speak O
with O
my O
understanding O
, O
so O
that O
I O
can O
teach O
others O
. O

Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
do O
n't O
think O
like O
children O
. O

In O
evil O
things O
be O
like O
babies O
, O
but O
in O
your O
thinking O
you O
should O
be O
like O
full O
- O
grown O
adults O
. O

As O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
Using O
those O
who O
speak O
a O
different O
language O
and O
using O
the O
lips O
of O
foreigners O
, O
I O
will O
speak O
to O
these O
people O
. O

But O
even O
then O
, O
they O
will O
not O
obey O
me O
. O
'' O

This O
is O
what O
the O
Lord O
says O
. O

And O
from O
this O
we O
see O
that O
the O
use O
of O
different O
languages O
shows O
how O
God O
deals O
with O
those O
who O
do O
n't O
believe O
, O
not O
with O
those O
who O
believe O
. O

And O
prophecy O
shows O
how O
God O
works O
through O
those O
who O
believe O
, O
not O
through O
unbelievers O
. O

Suppose O
the O
whole O
church O
meets O
together O
and O
you O
all O
speak O
in O
different O
languages O
. O

If O
some O
people O
come O
in O
who O
are O
without O
understanding O
or O
do O
n't O
believe O
, O
they O
will O
say O
you O
are O
crazy O
. O

But O
suppose O
you O
are O
all O
prophesying O
and O
someone O
comes O
in O
who O
does O
not O
believe O
or O
who O
is O
without O
understanding O
. O

Their O
sin O
will O
be O
shown O
to O
them O
, O
and O
they O
will O
be O
judged O
by O
everything O
you O
say O
. O

The O
secret O
things O
in O
their O
heart O
will O
be O
made O
known O
. O

So O
they O
will O
bow O
down O
and O
worship O
God O
. O

They O
will O
say O
, O
`` O
Without O
a O
doubt O
, O
God O
is O
here O
with O
you O
. O
'' O

So O
, O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
what O
should O
you O
do O
? O

When O
you O
meet O
together O
, O
one O
person O
has O
a O
song O
, O
another O
has O
a O
teaching O
, O
and O
another O
has O
a O
new O
truth O
from O
God O
. O

One O
person O
speaks O
in O
a O
different O
language O
, O
and O
another O
interprets O
that O
language O
. O

The O
purpose O
of O
whatever O
you O
do O
should O
be O
to O
help O
everyone O
grow O
stronger O
in O
faith O
. O

When O
you O
meet O
together O
, O
if O
anyone O
speaks O
to O
the O
group O
in O
a O
different O
language O
, O
it O
should O
be O
only O
two O
or O
no O
more O
than O
three O
people O
who O
do O
this O
. O

And O
they O
should O
speak O
one O
after O
the O
other O
. O

And O
someone O
else O
should O
interpret O
what O
they O
say O
. O

But O
if O
there O
is O
no O
interpreter O
, O
then O
anyone O
who O
speaks O
in O
a O
different O
language O
should O
be O
quiet O
in O
the O
church O
meeting O
. O

They O
should O
speak O
only O
to O
themselves O
and O
to O
God O
. O

And O
only O
two O
or O
three O
prophets O
should O
speak O
. O

The O
others O
should O
judge O
what O
they O
say O
. O

And O
if O
a O
message O
from O
God O
comes O
to O
someone O
who O
is O
sitting O
, O
the O
first O
speaker O
should O
be O
quiet O
. O

You O
can O
all O
prophesy O
one O
after O
the O
other O
. O

This O
way O
everyone O
can O
be O
taught O
and O
encouraged O
. O

The O
spirits O
of O
prophets O
are O
under O
the O
control O
of O
the O
prophets O
themselves O
. O

God O
is O
not O
a O
God O
of O
confusion O
but O
a O
God O
of O
peace O
. O

This O
is O
the O
rule O
for O
all O
the O
meetings O
of O
God O
's O
people O
. O

The O
women O
should O
keep O
quiet O
in O
these O
church O
meetings O
. O

They O
are O
not O
allowed O
to O
speak O
out O
but O
should O
be O
under O
authority O
, O
as O
the O
Law O
of O
Moses O
says O
. O

If O
there O
is O
something O
they O
want O
to O
know O
, O
they O
should O
ask O
their O
own O
husbands O
at O
home O
. O

It O
is O
shameful O
for O
a O
woman O
to O
speak O
up O
like O
that O
in O
the O
church O
meeting O
. O

God O
's O
teaching O
did O
not O
come O
from O
you O
, O
and O
you O
are O
not O
the O
only O
ones O
who O
have O
received O
it O
. O

If O
you O
think O
you O
are O
a O
prophet O
or O
that O
you O
have O
a O
spiritual O
gift O
, O
you O
should O
understand O
that O
what O
I O
am O
writing O
to O
you O
is O
the O
Lord O
's O
command O
. O

If O
you O
do O
not O
accept O
this O
, O
you O
will O
not O
be O
accepted O
. O

So O
my O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
continue O
to O
give O
your O
attention O
to O
prophesying O
. O

And O
do O
n't O
stop O
anyone O
from O
using O
the O
gift O
of O
speaking O
in O
different O
languages O
. O

But O
everything O
should O
be O
done O
in O
a O
way O
that O
is O
right O
and O
orderly O
. O

Later O
, O
Paul O
left O
Athens O
and O
went O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Corinth O
. O

There O
he O
met O
a O
Jewish O
man O
named O
Aquila O
, O
who O
was O
born O
in O
the O
country O
of O
Pontus O
. O

But O
he O
and O
his O
wife O
, O
Priscilla O
, O
had O
recently O
moved O
to O
Corinth O
from O
Italy O
. O

They O
left O
Italy O
because O
Claudius O
had O
given O
an O
order O
for O
all O
Jews O
to O
leave O
Rome O
. O

Paul O
went O
to O
visit O
Aquila O
and O
Priscilla O
. O

They O
were O
tentmakers O
, O
the O
same O
as O
Paul O
, O
so O
he O
stayed O
with O
them O
and O
worked O
with O
them O
. O

Every O
Sabbath O
day O
Paul O
went O
to O
the O
synagogue O
and O
talked O
with O
both O
Jews O
and O
Greeks O
, O
trying O
to O
persuade O
them O
to O
believe O
in O
Jesus O
. O

But O
after O
Silas O
and O
Timothy O
came O
from O
Macedonia O
, O
Paul O
spent O
all O
his O
time O
telling O
God O
's O
message O
to O
the O
Jews O
, O
trying O
to O
convince O
them O
that O
Jesus O
is O
the O
Christ O
. O

But O
they O
disagreed O
with O
what O
Paul O
was O
teaching O
and O
started O
insulting O
him O
. O

So O
Paul O
shook O
the O
dust O
from O
his O
clothes O
. O

He O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
If O
you O
are O
not O
saved O
, O
it O
will O
be O
your O
own O
fault O
! O

I O
have O
done O
all O
I O
can O
do O
. O

After O
this O
I O
will O
go O
only O
to O
the O
non-Jewish O
people O
. O
'' O

Paul O
left O
the O
synagogue O
and O
moved O
into O
the O
home O
of O
Titius O
Justus O
, O
a O
man O
who O
was O
a O
worshiper O
of O
the O
true O
God O
. O

His O
house O
was O
next O
to O
the O
synagogue O
. O

Crispus O
was O
the O
leader O
of O
that O
synagogue O
. O

He O
and O
all O
the O
people O
living O
in O
his O
house O
believed O
in O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
. O

Many O
other O
people O
in O
Corinth O
also O
listened O
to O
Paul O
. O

They O
, O
too O
, O
believed O
and O
were O
baptized O
. O

During O
the O
night O
, O
Paul O
had O
a O
vision O
. O

The O
Lord O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
be O
afraid O
, O
and O
do O
n't O
stop O
talking O
to O
people O
. O

I O
am O
with O
you O
, O
and O
no O
one O
will O
be O
able O
to O
hurt O
you O
. O

Many O
of O
my O
people O
are O
in O
this O
city O
. O
'' O

Paul O
stayed O
there O
for O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
teaching O
God O
's O
message O
to O
the O
people O
. O

During O
the O
time O
that O
Gallio O
was O
the O
governor O
of O
Achaia O
, O
some O
of O
the O
Jews O
came O
together O
against O
Paul O
. O

They O
took O
him O
to O
court O
. O

They O
said O
to O
Gallio O
, O
`` O
This O
man O
is O
teaching O
people O
to O
worship O
God O
in O
a O
way O
that O
is O
against O
our O
law O
! O
'' O

Paul O
was O
ready O
to O
say O
something O
, O
but O
Gallio O
spoke O
to O
the O
Jews O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
would O
listen O
to O
you O
if O
your O
complaint O
was O
about O
a O
crime O
or O
other O
wrong O
. O

But O
it O
is O
only O
about O
words O
and O
names O
-- O
arguments O
about O
your O
own O
law O
. O

So O
you O
must O
solve O
this O
problem O
yourselves O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
be O
a O
judge O
of O
these O
matters O
. O
'' O

So O
Gallio O
made O
them O
leave O
the O
court O
. O

Then O
they O
all O
grabbed O
Sosthenes O
, O
the O
leader O
of O
the O
synagogue O
. O

They O
beat O
him O
before O
the O
court O
. O

But O
this O
did O
not O
bother O
Gallio O
. O

Paul O
stayed O
with O
the O
believers O
for O
many O
days O
. O

Then O
he O
left O
and O
sailed O
for O
Syria O
. O

Priscilla O
and O
Aquila O
were O
also O
with O
him O
. O

At O
Cenchrea O
Paul O
cut O
off O
his O
hair O
, O
because O
he O
had O
made O
a O
promise O
to O
God O
. O

Then O
they O
went O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Ephesus O
, O
where O
Paul O
left O
Priscilla O
and O
Aquila O
. O

While O
Paul O
was O
in O
Ephesus O
, O
he O
went O
into O
the O
synagogue O
and O
talked O
with O
the O
Jews O
. O

They O
asked O
him O
to O
stay O
longer O
, O
but O
he O
refused O
. O

He O
left O
them O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
will O
come O
back O
to O
you O
again O
if O
God O
wants O
me O
to O
. O
'' O

And O
so O
he O
sailed O
away O
from O
Ephesus O
. O

When O
Paul O
arrived O
at O
Caesarea O
, O
he O
went O
to O
Jerusalem O
and O
visited O
the O
church O
there O
. O

After O
that O
, O
he O
went O
to O
Antioch O
. O

Paul O
stayed O
in O
Antioch O
for O
a O
while O
. O

Then O
he O
left O
there O
and O
went O
through O
the O
countries O
of O
Galatia O
and O
Phrygia O
. O

He O
traveled O
from O
town O
to O
town O
in O
these O
countries O
, O
helping O
all O
the O
followers O
grow O
stronger O
in O
their O
faith O
. O

A O
Jew O
named O
Apollos O
came O
to O
Ephesus O
. O

Born O
in O
the O
city O
of O
Alexandria O
, O
he O
was O
an O
educated O
man O
who O
knew O
the O
Scriptures O
well O
. O

He O
had O
been O
taught O
about O
the O
Lord O
and O
was O
always O
excited O
to O
talk O
to O
people O
about O
Jesus O
. O

What O
he O
taught O
was O
right O
, O
but O
the O
only O
baptism O
he O
knew O
about O
was O
the O
baptism O
that O
John O
taught O
. O

Apollos O
began O
to O
speak O
very O
boldly O
in O
the O
synagogue O
. O

When O
Priscilla O
and O
Aquila O
heard O
him O
speak O
, O
they O
took O
him O
to O
their O
home O
and O
helped O
him O
understand O
the O
way O
of O
God O
better O
. O

Apollos O
wanted O
to O
go O
to O
Achaia O
. O

So O
the O
believers O
in O
Ephesus O
helped O
him O
. O

They O
wrote O
a O
letter O
to O
the O
Lord O
's O
followers O
in O
Achaia O
and O
asked O
them O
to O
accept O
Apollos O
. O

When O
he O
arrived O
there O
, O
he O
was O
a O
great O
help O
to O
those O
who O
had O
believed O
in O
Jesus O
because O
of O
God O
's O
grace O
. O

He O
argued O
very O
strongly O
against O
the O
Jews O
before O
all O
the O
people O
. O

He O
clearly O
proved O
that O
the O
Jews O
were O
wrong O
. O

He O
used O
the O
Scriptures O
and O
showed O
that O
Jesus O
is O
the O
Christ O
. O

Saul O
agreed O
that O
the O
killing O
of O
Stephen O
was O
a O
good O
thing O
. O

Some O
godly O
men O
buried O
Stephen O
and O
cried O
loudly O
for O
him O
. O

On O
that O
day O
the O
Jews O
began O
to O
persecute O
the O
church O
in O
Jerusalem O
, O
making O
them O
suffer O
very O
much O
. O

Saul O
was O
also O
trying O
to O
destroy O
the O
group O
. O

He O
went O
into O
their O
houses O
, O
dragged O
out O
men O
and O
women O
, O
and O
put O
them O
in O
jail O
. O

All O
the O
believers O
left O
Jerusalem O
. O

Only O
the O
apostles O
stayed O
. O

The O
believers O
went O
to O
different O
places O
in O
Judea O
and O
Samaria O
. O

They O
were O
scattered O
everywhere O
, O
and O
in O
every O
place O
they O
went O
, O
they O
told O
people O
the O
Good O
News O
. O

Philip O
went O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Samaria O
and O
told O
people O
about O
the O
Christ O
. O

The O
people O
there O
heard O
Philip O
and O
saw O
the O
miraculous O
signs O
he O
was O
doing O
. O

They O
all O
listened O
carefully O
to O
what O
he O
said O
. O

Many O
of O
these O
people O
had O
evil O
spirits O
inside O
them O
, O
but O
Philip O
made O
the O
evil O
spirits O
leave O
them O
. O

The O
spirits O
made O
a O
lot O
of O
noise O
as O
they O
came O
out O
. O

There O
were O
also O
many O
weak O
and O
crippled O
people O
there O
. O

Philip O
made O
these O
people O
well O
too O
. O

What O
a O
happy O
day O
this O
was O
for O
that O
city O
! O

Now O
there O
was O
a O
man O
named O
Simon O
who O
lived O
in O
that O
city O
. O

Before O
Philip O
came O
there O
, O
Simon O
had O
been O
doing O
magic O
and O
amazing O
all O
the O
people O
of O
Samaria O
. O

He O
bragged O
and O
called O
himself O
a O
great O
man O
. O

All O
the O
people O
-- O
the O
least O
important O
and O
the O
most O
important O
-- O
believed O
what O
he O
said O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
This O
man O
has O
the O
power O
of O
God O
that O
is O
called O
' O
the O
Great O
Power O
. O
' O
'' O

Simon O
amazed O
the O
people O
with O
his O
magic O
for O
so O
long O
that O
the O
people O
became O
his O
followers O
. O

But O
Philip O
told O
the O
people O
the O
Good O
News O
about O
God O
's O
kingdom O
and O
the O
power O
of O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

Men O
and O
women O
believed O
Philip O
and O
were O
baptized O
. O

Simon O
himself O
also O
believed O
, O
and O
after O
he O
was O
baptized O
, O
he O
stayed O
close O
to O
Philip O
. O

When O
he O
saw O
the O
miraculous O
signs O
and O
powerful O
things O
Philip O
did O
, O
he O
was O
amazed O
. O

The O
apostles O
in O
Jerusalem O
heard O
that O
the O
people O
of O
Samaria O
had O
accepted O
the O
word O
of O
God O
. O

So O
they O
sent O
Peter O
and O
John O
to O
the O
people O
in O
Samaria O
. O

When O
Peter O
and O
John O
arrived O
, O
they O
prayed O
for O
the O
Samaritan O
believers O
to O
receive O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
. O

These O
people O
had O
been O
baptized O
in O
the O
name O
of O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
, O
but O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
had O
not O
yet O
come O
down O
on O
any O
of O
them O
. O

This O
is O
why O
Peter O
and O
John O
prayed O
. O

When O
the O
two O
apostles O
laid O
their O
hands O
on O
the O
people O
, O
they O
received O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
. O

Simon O
saw O
that O
the O
Spirit O
was O
given O
to O
people O
when O
the O
apostles O
laid O
their O
hands O
on O
them O
. O

So O
he O
offered O
the O
apostles O
money O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Give O
me O
this O
power O
so O
that O
when O
I O
lay O
my O
hands O
on O
someone O
, O
they O
will O
receive O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
. O
'' O

Peter O
said O
to O
Simon O
, O
`` O
You O
and O
your O
money O
should O
both O
be O
destroyed O
because O
you O
thought O
you O
could O
buy O
God O
's O
gift O
with O
money O
. O

You O
can O
not O
share O
with O
us O
in O
this O
work O
. O

Your O
heart O
is O
not O
right O
before O
God O
. O

Change O
your O
heart O
! O

Turn O
away O
from O
these O
evil O
thoughts O
and O
pray O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

Maybe O
he O
will O
forgive O
you O
. O

I O
see O
that O
you O
are O
full O
of O
bitter O
jealousy O
and O
can O
not O
stop O
yourself O
from O
doing O
wrong O
. O
'' O

Simon O
answered O
, O
`` O
Both O
of O
you O
pray O
to O
the O
Lord O
for O
me O
, O
so O
that O
what O
you O
have O
said O
will O
not O
happen O
to O
me O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
two O
apostles O
told O
the O
people O
what O
they O
had O
seen O
Jesus O
do O
. O

They O
told O
them O
the O
message O
of O
the O
Lord O
. O

Then O
they O
went O
back O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

On O
the O
way O
, O
they O
went O
through O
many O
Samaritan O
towns O
and O
told O
people O
the O
Good O
News O
. O

An O
angel O
of O
the O
Lord O
spoke O
to O
Philip O
. O

The O
angel O
said O
, O
`` O
Get O
ready O
and O
go O
south O
on O
the O
road O
that O
leads O
down O
to O
Gaza O
from O
Jerusalem O
-- O
the O
road O
that O
goes O
through O
the O
desert O
. O
'' O

So O
Philip O
got O
ready O
and O
went O
. O

On O
the O
road O
he O
saw O
a O
man O
from O
Ethiopia O
. O

He O
was O
a O
eunuch O
and O
an O
important O
officer O
in O
the O
service O
of O
Candace O
, O
the O
queen O
of O
the O
Ethiopians O
. O

He O
was O
responsible O
for O
taking O
care O
of O
all O
her O
money O
. O

This O
man O
had O
gone O
to O
Jerusalem O
to O
worship O
. O

Now O
he O
was O
on O
his O
way O
home O
. O

He O
was O
sitting O
in O
his O
chariot O
reading O
from O
the O
book O
of O
Isaiah O
the O
prophet O
. O

The O
Spirit O
said O
to O
Philip O
, O
`` O
Go O
to O
that O
chariot O
and O
stay O
near O
it O
. O
'' O

So O
he O
went O
toward O
the O
chariot O
, O
and O
he O
heard O
the O
man O
reading O
from O
Isaiah O
the O
prophet O
. O

Philip O
asked O
him O
, O
`` O
Do O
you O
understand O
what O
you O
are O
reading O
? O
'' O

The O
man O
answered O
, O
`` O
How O
can O
I O
understand O
? O

I O
need O
someone O
to O
explain O
it O
to O
me O
. O
'' O

Then O
he O
invited O
Philip O
to O
climb O
in O
and O
sit O
with O
him O
. O

The O
part O
of O
the O
Scriptures O
that O
he O
was O
reading O
was O
this O
: O
`` O
He O
was O
like O
a O
sheep O
being O
led O
to O
the O
butcher O
. O

He O
was O
like O
a O
lamb O
that O
makes O
no O
sound O
as O
its O
wool O
is O
being O
cut O
off O
. O

He O
said O
nothing O
. O

He O
was O
shamed O
, O
and O
all O
his O
rights O
were O
taken O
away O
. O

His O
life O
on O
earth O
has O
ended O
. O

So O
there O
will O
be O
no O
story O
about O
his O
descendants O
. O
'' O

The O
officer O
said O
to O
Philip O
, O
`` O
Please O
, O
tell O
me O
, O
who O
is O
the O
prophet O
talking O
about O
? O

Is O
he O
talking O
about O
himself O
or O
about O
someone O
else O
? O
'' O

Philip O
began O
to O
speak O
. O

He O
started O
with O
this O
same O
Scripture O
and O
told O
the O
man O
the O
Good O
News O
about O
Jesus O
. O

While O
they O
were O
traveling O
down O
the O
road O
, O
they O
came O
to O
some O
water O
. O

The O
officer O
said O
, O
`` O
Look O
, O
here O
is O
water O
! O

What O
is O
stopping O
me O
from O
being O
baptized O
? O
'' O

Then O
the O
officer O
ordered O
the O
chariot O
to O
stop O
. O

Both O
Philip O
and O
the O
officer O
went O
down O
into O
the O
water O
, O
and O
Philip O
baptized O
him O
. O

When O
they O
came O
up O
out O
of O
the O
water O
, O
the O
Spirit O
of O
the O
Lord O
took O
Philip O
away O
; O
the O
officer O
never O
saw O
him O
again O
. O

The O
officer O
continued O
on O
his O
way O
home O
. O

He O
was O
very O
happy O
. O

But O
Philip O
appeared O
in O
a O
city O
called O
Azotus O
. O

He O
was O
going O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Caesarea O
. O

He O
told O
people O
the O
Good O
News O
in O
all O
the O
towns O
on O
the O
way O
from O
Azotus O
to O
Caesarea O
. O

Paul O
said O
, O
`` O
My O
brothers O
and O
fathers O
, O
listen O
to O
me O
! O

I O
will O
make O
my O
defense O
to O
you O
. O
'' O

When O
the O
Jews O
heard O
Paul O
speaking O
Aramaic O
, O
they O
became O
very O
quiet O
. O

Then O
Paul O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
a O
Jew O
, O
born O
in O
Tarsus O
in O
the O
country O
of O
Cilicia O
. O

I O
grew O
up O
in O
this O
city O
. O

I O
was O
a O
student O
of O
Gamaliel O
, O
who O
carefully O
taught O
me O
everything O
about O
the O
law O
of O
our O
fathers O
. O

I O
was O
very O
serious O
about O
serving O
God O
, O
the O
same O
as O
all O

here O
today O

I O
persecuted O
the O
people O
who O
followed O
the O
Way O

Some O
of O
them O
were O
killed O
because O
of O
me O

I O
arrested O
men O
and O
women O
and O
put O
them O
in O
jail O

`` O
The O
high O
priest O
and O
the O
whole O
council O
of O
older O
Jewish O
leaders O
can O
tell O
you O
that O
this O
is O
true O
. O

One O
time O
these O
leaders O
gave O
me O
some O
letters O
. O

The O
letters O
were O
to O
the O
Jewish O
brothers O
in O
the O
city O
of O
Damascus O
. O

I O
was O
going O
there O
to O
arrest O
the O
followers O
of O
Jesus O
and O
bring O
them O
back O
to O
Jerusalem O
for O
punishment O
. O

`` O
But O
something O
happened O
to O
me O
on O
my O
way O
to O
Damascus O
. O

It O
was O
about O
noon O
when O
I O
came O
close O
to O
Damascus O
. O

Suddenly O
a O
bright O
light O
from O
heaven O
shined O
all O
around O
me O
. O

I O
fell O
to O
the O
ground O
and O
heard O
a O
voice O
saying O
to O
me O
, O
' O
Saul O
, O
Saul O
, O
why O
are O
you O
persecuting O
me O
? O
' O

`` O
I O
asked O
, O
' O
Who O
are O
you O
, O
Lord O
? O
' O

The O
voice O
said O
, O
' O
I O
am O
Jesus O
from O
Nazareth O
, O
the O
one O
you O
are O
persecuting O
. O
' O

The O
men O
who O
were O
with O
me O
did O
not O
understand O
the O
voice O
, O
but O
they O
saw O
the O
light O
. O

`` O
I O
said O
, O
' O
What O
shall O
I O
do O
, O
Lord O
? O
' O

The O
Lord O
answered O
, O
' O
Get O
up O
and O
go O
into O
Damascus O

There O
you O
will O
be O
told O
all O
that O
I O
have O
planned O
for O
you O
to O
do O

' O

I O
could O
not O
see O
, O
because O
the O
bright O
light O
had O
made O
me O
blind O
. O

So O
the O
men O
led O
me O
into O
Damascus O
. O

`` O
In O
Damascus O
a O
man O
named O
Ananias O
came O
to O
me O
. O

He O
was O
a O
man O
who O
was O
devoted O
to O
God O
and O
obeyed O
the O
Law O
of O
Moses O
. O

All O
the O
Jews O
who O
lived O
there O
respected O
him O
. O

He O
came O
to O
me O
and O
said O
, O
' O
Saul O
, O
my O
brother O
, O
look O
up O
and O
see O
again O
! O
' O

Immediately O
I O
was O
able O
to O
see O
him O

`` O
Ananias O
told O
me O
, O
' O
The O
God O
of O
our O
fathers O
chose O
you O
long O
ago O
to O
know O
his O
plan O

He O
chose O
you O
to O
see O
the O
Righteous O
One O
and O
to O
hear O
words O
from O
him O

You O
will O
be O
his O
witness O
to O
all O
people O

You O
will O
tell O
them O
what O
you O
have O

Now O

do O

wait O
any O

Get O
up O

be O
baptized O

wash O
away O
your O
sins O

trusting O
in O
Jesus O
to O
save O
you O

`` O
Later O
, O
I O
came O
back O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

I O
was O
praying O
in O
the O
Temple O
area O
, O
and O
I O
saw O
a O
vision O
. O

I O
saw O
Jesus O
, O
and O
he O
said O
to O
me O
, O
' O
Hurry O
and O
leave O
Jerusalem O
now O
! O

The O
people O
here O
will O
not O
accept O
the O
truth O
you O
tell O
them O
about O
me O

' O

`` O
I O
said O
, O
' O
But O
, O
Lord O
, O
the O
people O
know O
that O
I O
was O
the O
one O
who O
put O
the O
believers O
in O
jail O
and O
beat O
them O
. O

I O
went O
through O
all O
the O
synagogues O
to O
find O
and O
arrest O
the O
people O
who O
believe O
in O
you O
. O

The O
people O
also O
know O
that O
I O
was O
there O
when O
Stephen O
, O
your O
witness O
, O
was O
killed O
. O

I O
stood O
there O
and O
agreed O
that O
they O
should O
kill O
him O
. O

I O
even O
held O
the O
coats O
of O
the O
men O
who O
were O
killing O
him O
! O
' O

`` O
But O
Jesus O
said O
to O
me O
, O
' O
Leave O
now O
. O

I O
will O
send O
you O
far O
away O
to O
the O
non-Jewish O
people O
. O
' O
'' O

The O
people O
stopped O
listening O
when O
Paul O
said O
this O
last O
thing O
. O

They O
all O
shouted O
, O
`` O
Get O
rid O
of O
this O
man O
! O

He O
does O
n't O
deserve O
to O
live O
. O
'' O

They O
kept O
on O
shouting O
, O
ripping O
off O
their O
clothes O
and O
throwing O
dust O
into O
the O
air O
. O

Then O
the O
commander O
told O
the O
soldiers O
to O
take O
Paul O
into O
the O
army O
building O
and O
beat O
him O
. O

He O
wanted O
to O
make O
Paul O
tell O
why O
the O
people O
were O
shouting O
against O
him O
like O
this O
. O

So O
the O
soldiers O
were O
tying O
Paul O
, O
preparing O
to O
beat O
him O
. O

But O
he O
said O
to O
an O
army O
officer O
there O
, O
`` O
Do O
you O
have O
the O
right O
to O
beat O
a O
Roman O
citizen O
who O
has O
not O
been O
proven O
guilty O
? O
'' O

When O
the O
officer O
heard O
this O
, O
he O
went O
to O
the O
commander O
and O
told O
him O
about O
it O
. O

The O
officer O
said O
, O
`` O
Do O
you O
know O
what O
you O
are O
doing O
? O

This O
man O
is O
a O
Roman O
citizen O
! O
'' O

The O
commander O
came O
to O
Paul O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Tell O
me O
, O
are O
you O
really O
a O
Roman O
citizen O
? O
'' O

He O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O
. O
'' O

The O
commander O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
paid O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
to O
become O
a O
Roman O
citizen O
. O
'' O

But O
Paul O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
was O
born O
a O
citizen O
. O
'' O

The O
men O
who O
were O
preparing O
to O
question O
Paul O
moved O
away O
from O
him O
immediately O
. O

The O
commander O
was O
afraid O
because O
he O
had O
already O
put O
Paul O
in O
chains O
, O
and O
he O
was O
a O
Roman O
citizen O
. O

The O
next O
day O
the O
commander O
decided O
to O
learn O
why O
the O
Jews O
were O
accusing O
Paul O
. O

So O
he O
ordered O
the O
leading O
priests O
and O
the O
whole O
high O
council O
to O
meet O
together O
. O

He O
had O
Paul O
's O
chains O
taken O
off O
and O
had O
him O
brought O
in O
to O
face O
the O
council O
. O

Paul O
and O
Silas O
traveled O
through O
the O
cities O
of O
Amphipolis O
and O
Apollonia O
. O

They O
came O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Thessalonica O
, O
where O
there O
was O
a O
Jewish O
synagogue O
. O

Paul O
went O
into O
the O
synagogue O
to O
see O
the O
Jews O
as O
he O
always O
did O
. O

The O
next O
three O
weeks O
, O
on O
each O
Sabbath O
day O
, O
he O
discussed O
the O
Scriptures O
with O
them O
. O

He O
explained O
the O
Scriptures O
to O
show O
them O
that O
the O
Christ O
had O
to O
die O
and O
then O
rise O
from O
death O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
This O
Jesus O
that O
I O
am O
telling O
you O
about O
is O
the O
Christ O
. O
'' O

Some O
of O
the O
Jews O
there O
believed O
Paul O
and O
Silas O
and O
decided O
to O
join O
them O
. O

Also O
, O
a O
large O
number O
of O
Greeks O
who O
were O
worshipers O
of O
the O
true O
God O
and O
many O
important O
women O
joined O
them O
. O

But O
the O
Jews O
who O
did O
not O
believe O
became O
jealous O
, O
so O
they O
got O
some O
bad O
men O
from O
around O
the O
city O
center O
to O
make O
trouble O
. O

They O
formed O
a O
mob O
and O
caused O
a O
riot O
in O
the O
city O
. O

They O
went O
to O
Jason O
's O
house O
, O
looking O
for O
Paul O
and O
Silas O
. O

They O
wanted O
to O
bring O
them O
out O
before O
the O
people O
. O

When O
they O
did O
not O
find O
them O
, O
they O
dragged O
Jason O
and O
some O
of O
the O
other O
believers O
to O
the O
city O
leaders O
. O

The O
people O
shouted O
, O
`` O
These O
men O
have O
made O
trouble O
everywhere O
in O
the O
world O
, O
and O
now O
they O
have O
come O
here O
too O
! O

Jason O
is O
keeping O
them O
in O
his O
house O
. O

They O
all O
do O
things O
against O
the O
laws O
of O
Caesar O
. O

They O
say O
there O
is O
another O
king O
called O
Jesus O
. O
'' O

When O
the O
city O
leaders O
and O
the O
other O
people O
heard O
this O
, O
they O
became O
very O
upset O
. O

They O
made O
Jason O
and O
the O
other O
believers O
deposit O
money O
to O
guarantee O
that O
there O
would O
be O
no O
more O
trouble O
. O

Then O
they O
let O
them O
go O
. O

That O
same O
night O
the O
believers O
sent O
Paul O
and O
Silas O
to O
another O
city O
named O
Berea O
. O

When O
they O
arrived O
there O
, O
they O
went O
to O
the O
Jewish O
synagogue O
. O

The O
people O
in O
Berea O
were O
more O
open O
- O
minded O
than O
those O
in O
Thessalonica O
. O

They O
were O
so O
glad O
to O
hear O
the O
message O
Paul O
told O
them O
. O

They O
studied O
the O
Scriptures O
every O
day O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
what O
they O
heard O
was O
really O
true O
. O

The O
result O
was O
that O
many O
of O
them O
believed O
, O
including O
many O
important O
Greek O
women O
and O
men O
. O

But O
when O
the O
Jews O
in O
Thessalonica O
learned O
that O
Paul O
was O
telling O
people O
God O
's O
message O
in O
Berea O
, O
they O
came O
there O
too O
. O

They O
upset O
the O
people O
and O
made O
trouble O
. O

So O
the O
believers O
immediately O
sent O
Paul O
away O
to O
the O
coast O
, O
but O
Silas O
and O
Timothy O
stayed O
in O
Berea O
. O

Those O
who O
went O
with O
Paul O
took O
him O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Athens O
. O

They O
returned O
with O
a O
message O
for O
Silas O
and O
Timothy O
to O
come O
and O
join O
him O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
could O
. O

While O
Paul O
was O
waiting O
for O
Silas O
and O
Timothy O
in O
Athens O
, O
he O
was O
upset O
because O
he O
saw O
that O
the O
city O
was O
full O
of O
idols O
. O

In O
the O
synagogue O
he O
talked O
with O
the O
Jews O
and O
with O
the O
Greeks O
who O
were O
worshipers O
of O
the O
true O
God O
. O

He O
also O
went O
to O
the O
public O
square O
every O
day O
and O
talked O
with O
everyone O
who O
came O
by O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
Epicurean O
and O
some O
of O
the O
Stoic O
philosophers O
argued O
with O
him O
. O

Some O
of O
them O
said O
, O
`` O
This O
man O
does O
n't O
really O
know O
what O
he O
is O
talking O
about O
. O

What O
is O
he O
trying O
to O
say O
? O
'' O

Paul O
was O
telling O
them O
the O
Good O
News O
about O
Jesus O
and O
the O
resurrection O
. O

So O
they O
said O
, O
`` O
He O
seems O
to O
be O
telling O
us O
about O
some O
other O
gods O
. O
'' O

They O
took O
Paul O
to O
a O
meeting O
of O
the O
Areopagus O
council O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Please O
explain O
to O
us O
this O
new O
idea O
that O
you O
have O
been O
teaching O
. O

The O
things O
you O
are O
saying O
are O
new O
to O
us O
. O

We O
have O
never O
heard O
this O
teaching O
before O
, O
and O
we O
want O
to O
know O
what O
it O
means O
. O
'' O

-LRB- O
The O
people O
of O
Athens O
and O
the O
foreigners O
who O
lived O
there O
spent O
all O
their O
time O
either O
telling O
or O
listening O
to O
all O
the O
latest O
ideas O
. O
-RRB- O

Then O
Paul O
stood O
up O
before O
the O
meeting O
of O
the O
Areopagus O
council O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Men O
of O
Athens O
, O
everything O
I O
see O
here O
tells O
me O
you O
are O
very O
religious O
. O

I O
was O
going O
through O
your O
city O
and O
I O
saw O
the O
things O
you O
worship O
. O

I O
found O
an O
altar O
that O
had O
these O
words O
written O
on O
it O
: O
' O
to O
an O
unknown O
god O
. O
' O

You O
worship O
a O
god O
that O
you O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

This O
is O
the O
God O
I O
want O
to O
tell O
you O
about O
. O

`` O
He O
is O
the O
God O
who O
made O
the O
whole O
world O
and O
everything O
in O
it O
. O

He O
is O
the O
Lord O
of O
the O
land O
and O
the O
sky O
. O

He O
does O
not O
live O
in O
temples O
built O
by O
human O
hands O
. O

He O
is O
the O
one O
who O
gives O
people O
life O
, O
breath O
, O
and O
everything O
else O
they O
need O
. O

He O
does O
not O
need O
any O
help O
from O
them O
. O

He O
has O
everything O
he O
needs O
. O

God O
began O
by O
making O
one O
man O
, O
and O
from O
him O
he O
made O
all O
the O
different O
people O
who O
live O
everywhere O
in O
the O
world O
. O

He O
decided O
exactly O
when O
and O
where O
they O
would O
live O
. O

`` O
God O
wanted O
people O
to O
look O
for O
him O
, O
and O
perhaps O
in O
searching O
all O
around O
for O
him O
, O
they O
would O
find O
him O
. O

But O
he O
is O
not O
far O
from O
any O
of O
us O
. O

It O
is O
through O
him O
that O
we O
are O
able O
to O
live O
, O
to O
do O
what O
we O
do O
, O
and O
to O
be O
who O
we O
are O
. O

As O
your O
own O
poets O
have O
said O
, O
' O
We O
all O
come O
from O
him O
. O
' O

`` O
That O
's O
right O
. O

We O
all O
come O
from O
God O
. O

So O
you O
must O
not O
think O
that O
he O
is O
like O
something O
people O
imagine O
or O
make O
. O

He O
is O
not O
made O
of O
gold O
, O
silver O
, O
or O
stone O
. O

In O
the O
past O
people O
did O
not O
understand O
God O
, O
and O
he O
overlooked O
this O
. O

But O
now O
he O
is O
telling O
everyone O
in O
the O
world O
to O
change O
and O
turn O
to O
him O
. O

He O
has O
decided O
on O
a O
day O
when O
he O
will O
judge O
all O
the O
people O
in O
the O
world O
in O
a O
way O
that O
is O
fair O
. O

To O
do O
this O
he O
will O
use O
a O
man O
he O
chose O
long O
ago O
. O

And O
he O
has O
proved O
to O
everyone O
that O
this O
is O
the O
man O
to O
do O
it O
. O

He O
proved O
it O
by O
raising O
him O
from O
death O
! O
'' O

When O
the O
people O
heard O
about O
Jesus O
being O
raised O
from O
death O
, O
some O
of O
them O
laughed O
. O

But O
others O
said O
, O
`` O
We O
will O
hear O
more O
about O
this O
from O
you O
later O
. O
'' O

So O
Paul O
left O
the O
council O
meeting O
. O

But O
some O
of O
the O
people O
joined O
with O
Paul O
and O
became O
believers O
. O

Among O
these O
were O
Dionysius O
, O
a O
member O
of O
the O
Areopagus O
council O
, O
a O
woman O
named O
Damaris O
, O
and O
some O
others O
. O

There O
was O
a O
man O
named O
Ananias O

His O
wife O
's O
name O
was O
Sapphira O

Ananias O
sold O
some O
land O
he O
had O
, O
but O
he O
gave O
only O
part O
of O
the O
money O
to O
the O
apostles O
. O

He O
secretly O
kept O
some O
of O
the O
money O
for O
himself O
. O

His O
wife O
knew O
this O
, O
and O
she O
agreed O
with O
it O
. O

Peter O
said O
, O
`` O
Ananias O
, O
why O
did O
you O
let O
Satan O
fill O
your O
mind O
with O
such O
an O
idea O
? O

You O
kept O
part O
of O
the O
money O
for O
yourself O
and O
lied O
about O
it O
to O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
! O

Before O
you O
sold O
the O
field O
, O
it O
belonged O
to O
you O
, O
right O
? O

And O
even O
after O
you O
sold O
it O
, O
you O
could O
have O
used O
the O
money O
any O
way O
you O
wanted O
. O

How O
could O
you O
even O
think O
of O
doing O
such O
a O
thing O
? O

You O
lied O
to O
God O
, O
not O
to O
us O
! O
'' O

When O
Ananias O
heard O
this O
, O
he O
fell O
down O
and O
died O
. O

Some O
young O
men O
came O
and O
wrapped O
his O
body O
. O

They O
carried O
it O
out O
and O
buried O
it O
. O

And O
everyone O
who O
heard O
about O
this O
was O
filled O
with O
fear O
. O

About O
three O
hours O
later O
his O
wife O
came O
in O
. O

Sapphira O
did O
not O
know O
about O
what O
had O
happened O
to O
her O
husband O
. O

Peter O
said O
to O
her O
, O
`` O
Tell O
me O
how O
much O
money O
you O
got O
for O
your O
field O
. O

Was O
it O
this O
much O
? O
'' O

Sapphira O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
that O
was O
all O
we O
got O
for O
the O
field O
. O
'' O

Peter O
said O
to O
her O
, O
`` O
Why O
did O
you O
and O
your O
husband O
agree O
to O
test O
the O
Spirit O
of O
the O
Lord O
? O

Listen O
! O

Do O
you O
hear O
those O
footsteps O
? O

The O
men O
who O
buried O
your O
husband O
are O
at O
the O
door O
. O

They O
will O
carry O
you O
out O
in O
the O
same O
way O
. O
'' O

At O
that O
moment O
Sapphira O
fell O
down O
by O
his O
feet O
and O
died O
. O

The O
young O
men O
came O
in O
and O
saw O
that O
she O
was O
dead O
. O

They O
carried O
her O
out O
and O
buried O
her O
beside O
her O
husband O
. O

The O
whole O
group O
of O
believers O
and O
all O
the O
other O
people O
who O
heard O
about O
this O
were O
filled O
with O
fear O
. O

The O
apostles O
were O
given O
the O
power O
to O
do O
many O
miraculous O
signs O
and O
wonders O
among O
the O
people O
. O

They O
were O
together O
in O
Solomon O
's O
Porch O
, O
and O
they O
all O
had O
the O
same O
purpose O
. O

None O
of O
the O
other O
people O
dared O
to O
stand O
with O
the O
apostles O
, O
but O
everyone O
was O
saying O
wonderful O
things O
about O
them O
. O

More O
and O
more O
people O
believed O
in O
the O
Lord O
, O
and O
many O
men O
and O
women O
were O
added O
to O
the O
group O
of O
believers O
. O

So O
the O
people O
brought O
those O
who O
were O
sick O
into O
the O
streets O
and O
put O
them O
on O
little O
beds O
and O
mats O
. O

They O
were O
hoping O
that O
Peter O
's O
shadow O
might O
fall O
on O
them O
as O
he O
walked O
by O
. O

People O
came O
from O
all O
the O
towns O
around O
Jerusalem O
. O

They O
brought O
those O
who O
were O
sick O
or O
troubled O
by O
evil O
spirits O
. O

All O
of O
them O
were O
healed O
. O

The O
high O
priest O
and O
all O
his O
friends O
, O
a O
group O
called O
the O
Sadducees O
, O
became O
very O
jealous O
. O

They O
grabbed O
the O
apostles O
and O
put O
them O
in O
jail O
. O

But O
during O
the O
night O
, O
an O
angel O
of O
the O
Lord O
opened O
the O
doors O
of O
the O
jail O
. O

The O
angel O
led O
the O
apostles O
outside O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Go O
and O
stand O
in O
the O
Temple O
area O
. O

Tell O
the O
people O
everything O
about O
this O
new O
life O
. O
'' O

When O
the O
apostles O
heard O
this O
, O
they O
did O
what O
they O
were O
told O
. O

They O
went O
into O
the O
Temple O
area O
about O
sunrise O
and O
began O
to O
teach O
the O
people O
. O

The O
high O
priest O
and O
his O
friends O
came O
together O
and O
called O
a O
meeting O
of O
the O
high O
council O
and O
all O
the O
older O
Jewish O
leaders O
. O

They O
sent O
some O
men O
to O
the O
jail O
to O
bring O
the O
apostles O
to O
them O
. O

When O
the O
men O
went O
to O
the O
jail O
, O
they O
could O
not O
find O
the O
apostles O
there O
. O

So O
they O
went O
back O
and O
told O
the O
Jewish O
leaders O
about O
this O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
jail O
was O
closed O
and O
locked O
. O

The O
guards O
were O
standing O
at O
the O
doors O
. O

But O
when O
we O
opened O
the O
doors O
, O
the O
jail O
was O
empty O
! O
'' O

The O
captain O
of O
the O
Temple O
guards O
and O
the O
leading O
priests O
heard O
this O
. O

They O
were O
confused O
and O
wondered O
what O
it O
all O
meant O
. O

Then O
another O
man O
came O
and O
told O
them O
, O
`` O
Listen O
! O

The O
men O
you O
put O
in O
jail O
are O
standing O
in O
the O
Temple O
area O
teaching O
the O
people O
. O
'' O

The O
captain O
and O
his O
men O
went O
out O
and O
brought O
the O
apostles O
back O
. O

But O
the O
soldiers O
did O
not O
use O
force O
, O
because O
they O
were O
afraid O
of O
the O
people O
. O

They O
were O
afraid O
the O
people O
would O
stone O
them O
to O
death O
. O

The O
soldiers O
brought O
the O
apostles O
in O
and O
made O
them O
stand O
before O
the O
council O
. O

The O
high O
priest O
questioned O
them O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
We O
told O
you O
never O
again O
to O
teach O
as O
followers O
of O
that O
man O
. O

But O
look O
at O
what O
you O
have O
done O
! O

You O
have O
filled O
Jerusalem O
with O
your O
teaching O
. O

And O
you O
are O
trying O
to O
blame O
us O
for O
his O
death O
. O
'' O

Peter O
and O
the O
other O
apostles O
answered O
, O
`` O
We O
must O
obey O
God O
, O
not O
you O
! O

You O
killed O
Jesus O
by O
nailing O
him O
to O
a O
cross O
. O

But O
God O
, O
the O
same O
God O
our O
fathers O
had O
, O
raised O
Jesus O
up O
from O
death O
. O

Jesus O
is O
the O
one O
God O
honored O
by O
giving O
him O
a O
place O
at O
his O
right O
side O
. O

He O
made O
him O
our O
Leader O
and O
Savior O
. O

God O
did O
this O
to O
give O
all O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
the O
opportunity O
to O
change O
and O
turn O
to O
God O
to O
have O
their O
sins O
forgiven O
. O

We O
saw O
all O
these O
things O
happen O
, O
and O
we O
can O
say O
that O
they O
are O
true O
. O

The O
Holy O
Spirit O
also O
shows O
that O
these O
things O
are O
true O
. O

God O
has O
given O
this O
Spirit O
to O
all O
those O
who O
obey O
him O
. O
'' O

When O
the O
council O
members O
heard O
this O
, O
they O
became O
very O
angry O
. O

They O
began O
to O
plan O
a O
way O
to O
kill O
the O
apostles O
. O

But O
one O
member O
of O
the O
council O
, O
a O
Pharisee O
named O
Gamaliel O
, O
stood O
up O
. O

He O
was O
a O
teacher O
of O
the O
law O
, O
and O
all O
the O
people O
respected O
him O
. O

He O
told O
the O
men O
to O
make O
the O
apostles O
leave O
the O
meeting O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
. O

Then O
he O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Men O
of O
Israel O
, O
be O
careful O
of O
what O
you O
are O
planning O
to O
do O
to O
these O
men O
. O

Remember O
when O
Theudas O
appeared O
? O

He O
said O
he O
was O
an O
important O
man O
, O
and O
about O
400 O
men O
joined O
him O
. O

But O
he O
was O
killed O
, O
and O
all O
who O
followed O
him O
were O
scattered O
and O
ran O
away O
. O

They O
were O
not O
able O
to O
do O
anything O
. O

Later O
, O
during O
the O
time O
of O
the O
census O
, O
a O
man O
named O
Judas O
came O
from O
Galilee O
. O

Many O
people O
joined O
his O
group O
, O
but O
he O
was O
also O
killed O
, O
and O
all O
his O
followers O
were O
scattered O
. O

And O
so O
now O
I O
tell O
you O
, O
stay O
away O
from O
these O
men O
. O

Leave O
them O
alone O
. O

If O
their O
plan O
is O
something O
they O
thought O
up O
, O
it O
will O
fail O
. O

But O
if O
it O
is O
from O
God O
, O
you O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
stop O
them O
. O

You O
might O
even O
be O
fighting O
against O
God O
himself O
! O
'' O

The O
Jewish O
leaders O
agreed O
with O
what O
Gamaliel O
said O
. O

They O
called O
the O
apostles O
in O
again O
. O

They O
beat O
them O
and O
told O
them O
not O
to O
talk O
to O
people O
about O
Jesus O
again O
. O

Then O
they O
let O
them O
go O
free O
. O

The O
apostles O
left O
the O
council O
meeting O
. O

They O
were O
happy O
because O
they O
were O
given O
the O
honor O
of O
suffering O
dishonor O
for O
Jesus O
. O

The O
apostles O
did O
not O
stop O
teaching O
the O
people O
. O

They O
continued O
to O
tell O
the O
Good O
News O
-- O
that O
Jesus O
is O
the O
Christ O
. O

They O
did O
this O
every O
day O
in O
the O
Temple O
area O
and O
in O
people O
's O
homes O
. O

Five O
days O
later O
Ananias O
, O
the O
high O
priest O
, O
went O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Caesarea O
. O

He O
brought O
with O
him O
some O
of O
the O
older O
Jewish O
leaders O
and O
a O
lawyer O
named O
Tertullus O
. O

They O
went O
to O
Caesarea O
to O
make O
charges O
against O
Paul O
before O
the O
governor O
. O

Paul O
was O
called O
into O
the O
meeting O
, O
and O
Tertullus O
began O
to O
make O
his O
accusations O
. O

Tertullus O
said O
, O
`` O
Most O
Honorable O
Felix O
, O
our O
people O
enjoy O
much O
peace O
because O
of O
you O
, O
and O
many O
wrong O
things O
in O
our O
country O
are O
being O
made O
right O
through O
your O
wise O
help O
. O

For O
this O
we O
all O
continue O
to O
be O
very O
thankful O
. O

But O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
take O
any O
more O
of O
your O
time O
. O

So O
I O
will O
say O
only O
a O
few O
words O
. O

Please O
be O
patient O
. O

This O
man O
is O
a O
troublemaker O
. O

He O
causes O
trouble O
with O
the O
Jews O
everywhere O
in O
the O
world O
. O

He O
is O
a O
leader O
of O
the O
Nazarene O
group O
. O

Also O
, O
he O
was O
trying O
to O
make O
the O
Temple O
unclean O
, O
but O
we O
stopped O
him O
. O

You O
can O
decide O
if O
all O
this O
is O
true O
. O

Ask O
him O
some O
questions O
yourself O
. O
'' O

The O
other O
Jews O
agreed O
and O
said O
it O
was O
all O
true O
. O

The O
governor O
made O
a O
sign O
for O
Paul O
to O
speak O
. O

So O
Paul O
answered O
, O
`` O
Governor O
Felix O
, O
I O
know O
that O
you O
have O
been O
a O
judge O
over O
this O
nation O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

So O
I O
am O
happy O
to O
defend O
myself O
before O
you O
. O

I O
went O
to O
worship O
in O
Jerusalem O
only O
twelve O
days O
ago O
. O

You O
can O
learn O
for O
yourself O
that O
this O
is O
true O
. O

These O
Jews O
who O
are O
accusing O
me O
did O
not O
find O
me O
arguing O
with O
anyone O
at O
the O
Temple O
or O
making O
trouble O
with O
the O
people O
. O

And O
I O
was O
not O
making O
trouble O
or O
arguing O
in O
the O
synagogues O
or O
any O
other O
place O
in O
the O
city O
. O

These O
men O
can O
not O
prove O
the O
things O
they O
are O
saying O
against O
me O
now O
. O

`` O
But O
I O
will O
tell O
you O
this O
: O
I O
worship O
the O
God O
of O
our O
fathers O
as O
a O
follower O
of O
the O
Way O
, O
which O
these O
Jews O
say O
is O
not O
the O
right O
way O
, O
and O
I O
believe O
everything O
that O
is O
taught O
in O
the O
Law O
of O
Moses O
and O
all O
that O
is O
written O
in O
the O
books O
of O
the O
prophets O
. O

I O
have O
the O
same O
hope O
in O
God O
that O
these O
Jews O
have O
-- O
the O
hope O
that O
all O
people O
, O
good O
and O
bad O
, O
will O
be O
raised O
from O
death O
. O

This O
is O
why O
I O
always O
try O
to O
do O
what O
I O
believe O
is O
right O
before O
God O
and O
before O
everyone O
. O

`` O
I O
was O
away O
from O
Jerusalem O
for O
many O
years O
. O

I O
went O
back O
there O
to O
take O
money O
to O
help O
my O
people O
. O

I O
also O
had O
some O
gifts O
to O
offer O
at O
the O
Temple O
. O

I O
was O
doing O
this O
when O
some O
Jews O
saw O
me O
there O
. O

I O
had O
finished O
the O
cleansing O
ceremony O
. O

I O
had O
not O
made O
any O
trouble O
, O
and O
no O
one O
was O
gathering O
around O
me O
. O

But O
some O
Jews O
from O
Asia O
were O
there O
. O

They O
should O
be O
here O
, O
standing O
before O
you O
. O

If O
I O
have O
really O
done O
anything O
wrong O
, O
they O
are O
the O
ones O
who O
should O
accuse O
me O
. O

They O
were O
there O
! O

Ask O
these O
men O
here O
if O
they O
found O
any O
wrong O
in O
me O
when O
I O
stood O
before O
the O
high O
council O
meeting O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

I O
did O
say O
one O
thing O
when O
I O
stood O
before O
them O
and O
shouted O
, O
' O
You O
are O
judging O
me O
today O
because O
I O
believe O
that O
people O
will O
rise O
from O
death O
! O
' O
'' O

Felix O
already O
understood O
a O
lot O
about O
the O
Way O
. O

He O
stopped O
the O
trial O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
When O
commander O
Lysias O
comes O
here O
, O
I O
will O
decide O
what O
to O
do O
with O
you O
. O
'' O

Felix O
told O
the O
army O
officer O
to O
keep O
Paul O
guarded O
but O
to O
give O
him O
some O
freedom O
and O
to O
let O
his O
friends O
bring O
whatever O
he O
needed O
. O

After O
a O
few O
days O
Felix O
came O
with O
his O
wife O
Drusilla O
, O
who O
was O
a O
Jew O
. O

Felix O
asked O
for O
Paul O
to O
be O
brought O
to O
him O
. O

He O
listened O
to O
Paul O
talk O
about O
believing O
in O
Christ O
Jesus O
. O

But O
Felix O
became O
afraid O
when O
Paul O
spoke O
about O
things O
like O
doing O
right O
, O
self-control O
, O
and O
the O
judgment O
that O
will O
come O
in O
the O
future O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Go O
away O
now O
. O

When O
I O
have O
more O
time O
, O
I O
will O
call O
for O
you O
. O
'' O

But O
Felix O
had O
another O
reason O
for O
talking O
with O
Paul O
. O

He O
hoped O
Paul O
would O
pay O
him O
a O
bribe O
, O
so O
he O
sent O
for O
Paul O
often O
and O
talked O
with O
him O
. O

But O
after O
two O
years O
, O
Porcius O
Festus O
became O
governor O
. O

So O
Felix O
was O
no O
longer O
governor O
. O

But O
he O
left O
Paul O
in O
prison O
to O
please O
the O
Jews O
. O

The O
apostles O
and O
the O
believers O
in O
Judea O
heard O
that O
non-Jewish O
people O
had O
accepted O
God O
's O
teaching O
too O
. O

But O
when O
Peter O
came O
to O
Jerusalem O
, O
some O
Jewish O
believers O
argued O
with O
him O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
went O
into O
the O
homes O
of O
people O
who O
are O
not O
Jews O
and O
are O
not O
circumcised O
, O
and O
you O
even O
ate O
with O
them O
! O
'' O

So O
Peter O
explained O
the O
whole O
story O
to O
them O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
was O
in O
the O
city O
of O
Joppa O
. O

While O
I O
was O
praying O
, O
I O
had O
a O
vision O
. O

I O
saw O
something O
coming O
down O
from O
heaven O
. O

It O
looked O
like O
a O
big O
sheet O
being O
lowered O
to O
the O
ground O
by O
its O
four O
corners O
. O

It O
came O
down O
close O
to O
me O
, O
and O
I O
looked O
inside O
. O

I O
saw O
all O
kinds O
of O
animals O
, O
including O
wild O
ones O
, O
as O
well O
as O
reptiles O
and O
birds O
. O

I O
heard O
a O
voice O
say O
to O
me O
, O
' O
Get O
up O
, O
Peter O
. O

Kill O
anything O
here O
and O
eat O
it O
! O
' O

`` O
But O
I O
said O
, O
' O
I O
ca O
n't O
do O
that O
, O
Lord O
! O

I O
have O
never O
eaten O
anything O
that O
is O
not O
pure O
or O
fit O
to O
be O
used O
for O
food O
. O
' O

`` O
But O
the O
voice O
from O
heaven O
answered O
again O
, O
' O
God O
has O
made O
these O
things O
pure O
. O

Do O
n't O
say O
they O
are O
unfit O
to O
eat O
! O
' O

`` O
This O
happened O
three O
times O
. O

Then O
the O
whole O
thing O
was O
taken O
back O
into O
heaven O
. O

Suddenly O
there O
were O
three O
men O
standing O
outside O
the O
house O
where O
I O
was O
staying O
. O

They O
had O
been O
sent O
from O
Caesarea O
to O
get O
me O
. O

The O
Spirit O
told O
me O
to O
go O
with O
them O
without O
wondering O
if O
it O
was O
all O
right O
. O

These O
six O
brothers O
here O
also O
went O
with O
me O
, O
and O
we O
went O
to O
the O
house O
of O
Cornelius O
. O

He O
told O
us O
about O
the O
angel O
he O
had O
seen O
standing O
in O
his O
house O
. O

The O
angel O
said O
, O
' O
Send O
some O
men O
to O
Joppa O
to O
get O
Simon O
, O
the O
one O
who O
is O
also O
called O
Peter O
. O

He O
will O
speak O
to O
you O
, O
and O
what O
he O
tells O
you O
will O
save O
you O
and O
everyone O
living O
in O
your O
house O
. O
' O

`` O
After O
I O
began O
speaking O
, O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
came O
on O
them O
just O
as O
he O
came O
on O
us O
at O
the O
beginning O
. O

Then O
I O
remembered O
the O
words O
of O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
: O
' O
John O
baptized O
people O
in O
water O
, O
but O
you O
will O
be O
baptized O
in O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
. O
' O

God O
gave O
these O
people O
the O
same O
gift O
he O
gave O
us O
who O
believed O
in O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

So O
how O
could O
I O
object O
to O
what O
God O
wanted O
to O
do O
? O
'' O

When O
the O
Jewish O
believers O
heard O
this O
, O
they O
stopped O
arguing O
. O

They O
praised O
God O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
So O
God O
is O
also O
allowing O
the O
non-Jewish O
people O
to O
change O
their O
hearts O
and O
have O
the O
life O
he O
gives O
! O
'' O

The O
believers O
were O
scattered O
by O
the O
persecution O
that O
began O
when O
Stephen O
was O
killed O
. O

Some O
of O
them O
went O
as O
far O
as O
Phoenicia O
, O
Cyprus O
, O
and O
Antioch O
. O

They O
told O
the O
Good O
News O
in O
these O
places O
, O
but O
only O
to O
Jews O
. O

Some O
of O
these O
believers O
were O
men O
from O
Cyprus O
and O
Cyrene O
. O

When O
these O
men O
came O
to O
Antioch O
, O
they O
began O
speaking O
to O
people O
who O
were O
not O
Jews O
. O

They O
told O
them O
the O
Good O
News O
about O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
. O

The O
Lord O
was O
helping O
these O
men O
, O
and O
a O
large O
number O
of O
people O
believed O
and O
decided O
to O
follow O
the O
Lord O
. O

When O
the O
church O
in O
Jerusalem O
heard O
about O
this O
, O
they O
sent O
Barnabas O
to O
Antioch O
. O

Barnabas O
was O
a O
good O
man O
, O
full O
of O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
and O
faith O
. O

When O
he O
went O
to O
Antioch O
and O
saw O
how O
God O
had O
blessed O
the O
believers O
there O
, O
he O
was O
very O
happy O
. O

He O
encouraged O
them O
all O
, O
saying O
, O
`` O
Always O
be O
faithful O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

Serve O
him O
with O
all O
your O
heart O
. O
'' O

Many O
more O
people O
became O
followers O
of O
the O
Lord O
. O

Then O
Barnabas O
went O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Tarsus O
to O
look O
for O
Saul O
. O

When O
he O
found O
him O
, O
he O
brought O
him O
to O
Antioch O
. O

They O
stayed O
there O
a O
whole O
year O
. O

Every O
time O
the O
church O
came O
together O
, O
Barnabas O
and O
Saul O
met O
with O
them O
and O
taught O
many O
people O
. O

It O
was O
in O
Antioch O
that O
the O
followers O
were O
called O
`` O
Christ O
- O
followers O
'' O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

About O
that O
same O
time O
some O
prophets O
went O
from O
Jerusalem O
to O
Antioch O
. O

One O
of O
them O
, O
named O
Agabus O
, O
stood O
up O
and O
spoke O
with O
the O
help O
of O
the O
Spirit O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
A O
very O
bad O
time O
is O
coming O
to O
the O
whole O
world O
. O

There O
will O
be O
no O
food O
for O
people O
to O
eat O
. O
'' O

-LRB- O
This O
time O
of O
famine O
happened O
when O
Claudius O
was O
emperor O
. O
-RRB- O

The O
Lord O
's O
followers O
decided O
that O
they O
would O
each O
send O
as O
much O
as O
they O
could O
to O
help O
their O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
who O
lived O
in O
Judea O
. O

They O
gathered O
the O
money O
and O
gave O
it O
to O
Barnabas O
and O
Saul O
, O
who O
took O
it O
to O
the O
elders O
in O
Judea O
. O

Paul O
went O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Derbe O
and O
then O
to O
Lystra O
, O
where O
a O
follower O
of O
Jesus O
named O
Timothy O
lived O
. O

Timothy O
's O
mother O
was O
a O
Jewish O
believer O
, O
but O
his O
father O
was O
a O
Greek O
. O

The O
believers O
in O
the O
cities O
of O
Lystra O
and O
Iconium O
had O
only O
good O
things O
to O
say O
about O
him O
. O

Paul O
wanted O
Timothy O
to O
travel O
with O
him O
, O
but O
all O
the O
Jews O
living O
in O
that O
area O
knew O
that O
his O
father O
was O
a O
Greek O
. O

So O
Paul O
circumcised O
Timothy O
to O
please O
the O
Jews O
. O

Then O
Paul O
and O
those O
with O
him O
traveled O
through O
other O
cities O
. O

They O
gave O
the O
believers O
the O
rules O
and O
decisions O
from O
the O
apostles O
and O
elders O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

They O
told O
them O
to O
obey O
these O
rules O
. O

So O
the O
churches O
were O
becoming O
stronger O
in O
the O
faith O
and O
were O
growing O
bigger O
every O
day O
. O

Paul O
and O
those O
with O
him O
went O
through O
the O
areas O
of O
Phrygia O
and O
Galatia O
because O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
did O
not O
allow O
them O
to O
tell O
the O
Good O
News O
in O
the O
province O
of O
Asia O
. O

When O
they O
reached O
the O
border O
of O
Mysia O
, O
they O
tried O
to O
go O
on O
into O
Bithynia O
, O
but O
the O
Spirit O
of O
Jesus O
did O
not O
let O
them O
go O
there O
. O

So O
they O
passed O
by O
Mysia O
and O
went O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Troas O
. O

That O
night O
Paul O
saw O
a O
vision O
. O

In O
it O
, O
a O
man O
from O
Macedonia O
came O
to O
Paul O
. O

The O
man O
stood O
there O
and O
begged O
, O
`` O
Come O
across O
to O
Macedonia O
and O
help O
us O
. O
'' O

After O
Paul O
had O
seen O
the O
vision O
, O
we O
immediately O
prepared O
to O
leave O
for O
Macedonia O
. O

We O
understood O
that O
God O
had O
called O
us O
to O
tell O
the O
Good O
News O
to O
those O
people O
. O

We O
left O
Troas O
in O
a O
ship O
and O
sailed O
to O
the O
island O
of O
Samothrace O
. O

The O
next O
day O
we O
sailed O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Neapolis O
. O

Then O
we O
went O
to O
Philippi O
, O
a O
Roman O
colony O
and O
the O
leading O
city O
in O
that O
part O
of O
Macedonia O
. O

We O
stayed O
there O
for O
a O
few O
days O
. O

On O
the O
Sabbath O
day O
we O
went O
out O
the O
city O
gate O
to O
the O
river O
. O

There O
we O
thought O
we O
might O
find O
a O
special O
place O
for O
prayer O
. O

Some O
women O
had O
gathered O
there O
, O
so O
we O
sat O
down O
and O
talked O
with O
them O
. O

There O
was O
a O
woman O
there O
named O
Lydia O
from O
the O
city O
of O
Thyatira O
. O

Her O
job O
was O
selling O
purple O
cloth O
. O

She O
was O
a O
worshiper O
of O
the O
true O
God O
. O

Lydia O
was O
listening O
to O
Paul O
, O
and O
the O
Lord O
opened O
her O
heart O
to O
accept O
what O
Paul O
was O
saying O
. O

She O
and O
all O
the O
people O
living O
in O
her O
house O
were O
baptized O
. O

Then O
she O
invited O
us O
into O
her O
home O
. O

She O
said O
, O
`` O
If O
you O
think O
I O
am O
a O
true O
believer O
in O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
, O
come O
stay O
in O
my O
house O
. O
'' O

She O
persuaded O
us O
to O
stay O
with O
her O
. O

One O
day O
we O
were O
going O
to O
the O
place O
for O
prayer O
, O
and O
a O
servant O
girl O
met O
us O
. O

She O
had O
a O
spirit O
in O
her O
that O
gave O
her O
the O
power O
to O
tell O
what O
would O
happen O
in O
the O
future O
. O

By O
doing O
this O
she O
earned O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
for O
the O
men O
who O
owned O
her O
. O

She O
started O
following O
Paul O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
around O
. O

She O
kept O
shouting O
, O
`` O
These O
men O
are O
servants O
of O
the O
Most O
High O
God O
! O

They O
are O
telling O
you O
how O
you O
can O
be O
saved O
! O
'' O

She O
continued O
doing O
this O
for O
many O
days O
. O

This O
bothered O
Paul O
, O
so O
he O
turned O
and O
said O
to O
the O
spirit O
, O
`` O
By O
the O
power O
of O
Jesus O
Christ O
, O
I O
command O
you O
to O
come O
out O
of O
her O
! O
'' O

Immediately O
, O
the O
spirit O
came O
out O
. O

When O
the O
men O
who O
owned O
the O
servant O
girl O
saw O
this O
, O
they O
realized O
that O
they O
could O
no O
longer O
use O
her O
to O
make O
money O
. O

So O
they O
grabbed O
Paul O
and O
Silas O
and O
dragged O
them O
to O
the O
public O
square O
to O
meet O
with O
the O
authorities O
. O

They O
brought O
Paul O
and O
Silas O
before O
the O
Roman O
officials O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
These O
men O
are O
Jews O
, O
and O
they O
are O
making O
trouble O
in O
our O
city O
. O

They O
are O
telling O
people O
to O
do O
things O
that O
are O
not O
right O
for O
us O
as O
Romans O
to O
do O
. O
'' O

The O
whole O
crowd O
turned O
against O
Paul O
and O
Silas O
. O

The O
officials O
tore O
the O
clothes O
off O
both O
men O
and O
ordered O
that O
they O
be O
beaten O
with O
rods O
. O

They O
were O
beaten O
severely O
and O
thrown O
into O
jail O
. O

The O
officials O
told O
the O
jailer O
, O
`` O
Guard O
them O
very O
carefully O
! O
'' O

When O
the O
jailer O
heard O
this O
special O
order O
, O
he O
put O
Paul O
and O
Silas O
far O
inside O
the O
jail O
and O
bound O
their O
feet O
between O
large O
blocks O
of O
wood O
. O

About O
midnight O
Paul O
and O
Silas O
were O
praying O
and O
singing O
songs O
to O
God O
. O

The O
other O
prisoners O
were O
listening O
to O
them O
. O

Suddenly O
there O
was O
an O
earthquake O
so O
strong O
that O
it O
shook O
the O
foundation O
of O
the O
jail O
. O

All O
the O
doors O
of O
the O
jail O
opened O
, O
and O
the O
chains O
on O
all O
the O
prisoners O
fell O
off O
. O

The O
jailer O
woke O
up O
and O
saw O
that O
the O
jail O
doors O
were O
open O
. O

He O
thought O
that O
the O
prisoners O
had O
already O
escaped O
, O
so O
he O
got O
his O
sword O
and O
was O
ready O
to O
kill O
himself O
. O

But O
Paul O
shouted O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
hurt O
yourself O
! O

We O
are O
all O
here O
! O
'' O

The O
jailer O
told O
someone O
to O
bring O
a O
light O
. O

Then O
he O
ran O
inside O
and O
, O
shaking O
with O
fear O
, O
fell O
down O
in O
front O
of O
Paul O
and O
Silas O
. O

Then O
he O
brought O
them O
outside O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Men O
, O
what O
must O
I O
do O
to O
be O
saved O
? O
'' O

They O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Believe O
in O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
and O
you O
will O
be O
saved O
-- O
you O
and O
all O
who O
live O
in O
your O
house O
. O
'' O

So O
Paul O
and O
Silas O
told O
the O
message O
of O
the O
Lord O
to O
the O
jailer O
and O
all O
the O
people O
who O
lived O
in O
his O
house O
. O

It O
was O
late O
at O
night O
, O
but O
the O
jailer O
took O
Paul O
and O
Silas O
and O
washed O
their O
wounds O
. O

Then O
the O
jailer O
and O
all O
his O
people O
were O
baptized O
. O

After O
this O
the O
jailer O
took O
Paul O
and O
Silas O
home O
and O
gave O
them O
some O
food O
. O

All O
the O
people O
were O
very O
happy O
because O
they O
now O
believed O
in O
God O
. O

The O
next O
morning O
the O
Roman O
officials O
sent O
some O
soldiers O
to O
tell O
the O
jailer O
, O
`` O
Let O
these O
men O
go O
free O
. O
'' O

The O
jailer O
said O
to O
Paul O
, O
`` O
The O
officials O
have O
sent O
these O
soldiers O
to O
let O
you O
go O
free O
. O

You O
can O
leave O
now O
. O

Go O
in O
peace O
. O
'' O

But O
Paul O
said O
to O
the O
soldiers O
, O
`` O
Those O
officials O
did O
not O
prove O
that O
we O
did O
anything O
wrong O
, O
but O
they O
beat O
us O
in O
public O
and O
put O
us O
in O
jail O
. O

And O
we O
are O
Roman O
citizens O
. O

Now O
they O
want O
us O
to O
go O
away O
quietly O
. O

No O
, O
they O
must O
come O
here O
themselves O
and O
lead O
us O
out O
! O
'' O

The O
soldiers O
told O
the O
officials O
what O
Paul O
said O
. O

When O
they O
heard O
that O
Paul O
and O
Silas O
were O
Roman O
citizens O
, O
they O
were O
afraid O
. O

So O
they O
came O
and O
told O
them O
they O
were O
sorry O
. O

They O
led O
them O
out O
of O
the O
jail O
and O
asked O
them O
to O
leave O
the O
city O
. O

But O
when O
Paul O
and O
Silas O
came O
out O
of O
the O
jail O
, O
they O
went O
to O
Lydia O
's O
house O
. O

They O
saw O
some O
of O
the O
believers O
there O
and O
encouraged O
them O
. O

Then O
they O
left O
. O

One O
day O
Peter O
and O
John O
went O
to O
the O
Temple O
area O
. O

It O
was O
three O
o'clock O
in O
the O
afternoon O
, O
which O
was O
the O
time O
for O
the O
daily O
Temple O
prayer O
service O
. O

As O
they O
were O
entering O
the O
Temple O
area O
, O
a O
man O
was O
there O
who O
had O
been O
crippled O
all O
his O
life O
. O

He O
was O
being O
carried O
by O
some O
friends O
who O
brought O
him O
to O
the O
Temple O
every O
day O
. O

They O
put O
him O
by O
one O
of O
the O
gates O
outside O
the O
Temple O
. O

It O
was O
called O
Beautiful O
Gate O
. O

There O
he O
begged O
for O
money O
from O
the O
people O
going O
to O
the O
Temple O
. O

That O
day O
he O
saw O
Peter O
and O
John O
going O
into O
the O
Temple O
area O
. O

He O
asked O
them O
for O
money O
. O

Peter O
and O
John O
looked O
at O
the O
crippled O
man O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Look O
at O
us O
! O
'' O

He O
looked O
at O
them O
; O
he O
thought O
they O
would O
give O
him O
some O
money O
. O

But O
Peter O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
any O
silver O
or O
gold O
, O
but O
I O
do O
have O
something O
else O
I O
can O
give O
you O
. O

By O
the O
power O
of O
Jesus O
Christ O
from O
Nazareth O
-- O
stand O
up O
and O
walk O
! O
'' O

Then O
Peter O
took O
the O
man O
's O
right O
hand O
and O
lifted O
him O
up O
. O

Immediately O
his O
feet O
and O
legs O
became O
strong O
. O

He O
jumped O
up O
, O
stood O
on O
his O
feet O
, O
and O
began O
to O
walk O
. O

He O
went O
into O
the O
Temple O
area O
with O
them O
. O

He O
was O
walking O
and O
jumping O
and O
praising O
God O
. O

All O
the O
people O
recognized O
him O
. O

They O
knew O
he O
was O
the O
crippled O
man O
who O
always O
sat O
by O
the O
Beautiful O
Gate O
to O
beg O
for O
money O
. O

Now O
they O
saw O
this O
same O
man O
walking O
and O
praising O
God O
. O

They O
were O
amazed O
. O

They O
did O
not O
understand O
how O
this O
could O
happen O
. O

The O
man O
was O
holding O
on O
to O
Peter O
and O
John O
. O

All O
the O
people O
were O
amazed O
. O

They O
ran O
to O
Peter O
and O
John O
at O
Solomon O
's O
Porch O
. O

When O
Peter O
saw O
this O
, O
he O
said O
to O
the O
people O
, O
`` O
My O
Jewish O
brothers O
, O
why O
are O
you O
surprised O
at O
this O
? O

You O
are O
looking O
at O
us O
as O
if O
it O
was O
our O
power O
that O
made O
this O
man O
walk O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
this O
was O
done O
because O
we O
are O
good O
? O

No O
, O
God O
did O
it O
! O

He O
is O
the O
God O
of O
Abraham O
, O
the O
God O
of O
Isaac O
, O
and O
the O
God O
of O
Jacob O
. O

He O
is O
the O
God O
of O
all O
our O
fathers O
. O

He O
gave O
glory O
to O
Jesus O
, O
his O
special O
servant O
. O

But O
you O
handed O
him O
over O
to O
be O
killed O
. O

Pilate O
decided O
to O
let O
him O
go O
free O
. O

But O
you O
told O
Pilate O
you O
did O
not O
want O
him O
. O

Jesus O
was O
holy O
and O
good O
, O
but O
you O
said O
you O
did O
not O
want O
him O
. O

You O
told O
Pilate O
to O
give O
you O
a O
murderer O
instead O
of O
Jesus O
. O

And O
so O
you O
killed O
the O
one O
who O
gives O
life O
! O

But O
God O
raised O
him O
from O
death O
. O

We O
are O
witnesses O
of O
this O
-- O
we O
saw O
it O
with O
our O
own O
eyes O
. O

`` O
This O
crippled O
man O
was O
healed O
because O
we O
trusted O
in O
Jesus O
. O

It O
was O
Jesus O
' O
power O
that O
made O
him O
well O
. O

You O
can O
see O
this O
man O
, O
and O
you O
know O
him O
. O

He O
was O
made O
completely O
well O
because O
of O
faith O
in O
Jesus O
. O

You O
all O
saw O
it O
happen O
! O

`` O
My O
brothers O
, O
I O
know O
that O
what O
you O
did O
to O
Jesus O
was O
done O
because O
you O
did O
not O
understand O
what O
you O
were O
doing O
. O

And O
your O
leaders O
did O
not O
understand O
any O
more O
than O
you O
did O
. O

But O
God O
said O
these O
things O
would O
happen O
. O

Through O
the O
prophets O
he O
said O
that O
his O
Christ O
would O
suffer O
and O
die O
. O

I O
have O
told O
you O
how O
God O
made O
this O
happen O
. O

So O
you O
must O
change O
your O
hearts O
and O
lives O
. O

Come O
back O
to O
God O
, O
and O
he O
will O
forgive O
your O
sins O
. O

Then O
the O
Lord O
will O
give O
you O
times O
of O
spiritual O
rest O
. O

He O
will O
send O
you O
Jesus O
, O
the O
one O
he O
chose O
to O
be O
the O
Christ O
. O

`` O
But O
Jesus O
must O
stay O
in O
heaven O
until O
the O
time O
when O
all O
things O
will O
be O
made O
right O
again O
. O

God O
told O
about O
this O
time O
when O
he O
spoke O
long O
ago O
through O
his O
holy O
prophets O
. O

Moses O
said O
, O
' O
The O
Lord O
your O
God O
will O
give O
you O
a O
prophet O
. O

That O
prophet O
will O
come O
from O
among O
your O
own O
people O
. O

He O
will O
be O
like O
me O
. O

You O
must O
obey O
everything O
he O
tells O
you O
. O

And O
anyone O
who O
refuses O
to O
obey O
that O
prophet O
will O
die O
, O
separated O
from O
God O
's O
people O
. O
' O

`` O
Samuel O
, O
and O
all O
the O
other O
prophets O
who O
spoke O
for O
God O
after O
Samuel O
, O
said O
that O
this O
time O
would O
come O
. O

And O
what O
those O
prophets O
talked O
about O
is O
for O
you O
, O
their O
descendants O
. O

You O
have O
received O
the O
agreement O
that O
God O
made O
with O
your O
fathers O
. O

God O
said O
to O
your O
father O
Abraham O
, O
' O
Every O
nation O
on O
earth O
will O
be O
blessed O
through O
your O
descendants O

' O

God O
has O
sent O
his O
special O
servant O
Jesus O
. O

He O
sent O
him O
to O
you O
first O
. O

He O
sent O
him O
to O
bless O
you O
by O
causing O
each O
of O
you O
to O
turn O
away O
from O
your O
evil O
ways O
. O
'' O

It O
was O
decided O
that O
we O
would O
sail O
for O
Italy O
. O

An O
army O
officer O
named O
Julius O
, O
who O
served O
in O
the O
emperor O
's O
special O
army O
, O
was O
put O
in O
charge O
of O
guarding O
Paul O
and O
some O
other O
prisoners O
on O
the O
trip O
. O

We O
got O
on O
a O
ship O
from O
the O
city O
of O
Adramyttium O
that O
was O
ready O
to O
sail O
to O
different O
places O
in O
Asia O
. O

Aristarchus O
, O
a O
man O
from O
Thessalonica O
in O
Macedonia O
, O
went O
with O
us O
. O

The O
next O
day O
we O
came O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Sidon O
. O

Julius O
was O
very O
good O
to O
Paul O
and O
gave O
him O
freedom O
to O
go O
visit O
his O
friends O
there O
, O
who O
gave O
him O
whatever O
he O
needed O
. O

We O
left O
that O
city O
and O
sailed O
close O
to O
the O
island O
of O
Cyprus O
because O
the O
wind O
was O
blowing O
against O
us O
. O

We O
went O
across O
the O
sea O
by O
Cilicia O
and O
Pamphylia O
. O

Then O
we O
came O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Myra O
in O
Lycia O
. O

There O
the O
army O
officer O
found O
a O
ship O
from O
the O
city O
of O
Alexandria O
that O
was O
going O
to O
Italy O
. O

So O
he O
put O
us O
on O
it O
. O

We O
sailed O
slowly O
for O
many O
days O
. O

It O
was O
hard O
for O
us O
to O
reach O
the O
city O
of O
Cnidus O
because O
the O
wind O
was O
blowing O
against O
us O
. O

We O
could O
not O
go O
any O
farther O
that O
way O
, O
so O
we O
sailed O
by O
the O
south O
side O
of O
the O
island O
of O
Crete O
near O
Salmone O
. O

We O
sailed O
along O
the O
coast O
, O
but O
the O
sailing O
was O
hard O
. O

Then O
we O
came O
to O
a O
place O
called O
Safe O
Harbors O
, O
near O
the O
city O
of O
Lasea O
. O

We O
had O
lost O
much O
time O
, O
and O
it O
was O
now O
dangerous O
to O
sail O
, O
because O
it O
was O
already O
after O
the O
Jewish O
day O
of O
fasting O
. O

So O
Paul O
warned O
them O
, O
`` O
Men O
, O
I O
can O
see O
that O
there O
will O
be O
a O
lot O
of O
trouble O
on O
this O
trip O
. O

The O
ship O
, O
everything O
in O
it O
, O
and O
even O
our O
lives O
may O
be O
lost O
! O
'' O

But O
the O
captain O
and O
the O
owner O
of O
the O
ship O
did O
not O
agree O
with O
Paul O
. O

So O
the O
army O
officer O
accepted O
what O
they O
said O
instead O
of O
believing O
Paul O
. O

Also O
, O
that O
harbor O
was O
not O
a O
good O
place O
for O
the O
ship O
to O
stay O
for O
the O
winter O
, O
so O
most O
of O
the O
men O
decided O
that O
we O
should O
leave O
there O
. O

They O
hoped O
we O
could O
reach O
Phoenix O
, O
where O
the O
ship O
could O
stay O
for O
the O
winter O
. O

Phoenix O
, O
a O
city O
on O
the O
island O
of O
Crete O
, O
had O
a O
harbor O
that O
faced O
southwest O
and O
northwest O
. O

Then O
a O
good O
wind O
began O
to O
blow O
from O
the O
south O
. O

The O
men O
on O
the O
ship O
thought O
, O
`` O
This O
is O
the O
wind O
we O
wanted O
, O
and O
now O
we O
have O
it O
! O
'' O

So O
they O
pulled O
up O
the O
anchor O
. O

We O
sailed O
very O
close O
to O
the O
island O
of O
Crete O
. O

But O
then O
a O
very O
strong O
wind O
called O
the O
`` O
Northeaster O
'' O
came O
from O
across O
the O
island O
. O

This O
wind O
took O
the O
ship O
and O
carried O
it O
away O
. O

The O
ship O
could O
not O
sail O
against O
the O
wind O
, O
so O
we O
stopped O
trying O
and O
let O
the O
wind O
blow O
us O
. O

We O
went O
below O
a O
small O
island O
named O
Cauda O
. O

With O
the O
island O
protecting O
us O
from O
the O
wind O
, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
bring O
in O
the O
lifeboat O
, O
but O
it O
was O
very O
hard O
to O
do O
. O

After O
the O
men O
brought O
the O
lifeboat O
in O
, O
they O
tied O
ropes O
around O
the O
ship O
to O
hold O
it O
together O
. O

The O
men O
were O
afraid O
that O
the O
ship O
would O
hit O
the O
sandbanks O
of O
Syrtis O
. O

So O
they O
lowered O
the O
sail O
and O
let O
the O
wind O
carry O
the O
ship O
. O

The O
next O
day O
the O
storm O
was O
blowing O
against O
us O
so O
hard O
that O
the O
men O
threw O
some O
things O
out O
of O
the O
ship O
. O

A O
day O
later O
they O
threw O
out O
the O
ship O
's O
equipment O
. O

For O
many O
days O
we O
could O
not O
see O
the O
sun O
or O
the O
stars O
. O

The O
storm O
was O
very O
bad O
. O

We O
lost O
all O
hope O
of O
staying O
alive O
-- O
we O
thought O
we O
would O
die O
. O

The O
men O
did O
not O
eat O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

Then O
one O
day O
Paul O
stood O
up O
before O
them O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Men O
, O
I O
told O
you O
not O
to O
leave O
Crete O
. O

You O
should O
have O
listened O
to O
me O
. O

Then O
you O
would O
not O
have O
all O
this O
trouble O
and O
loss O
. O

But O
now O
I O
tell O
you O
to O
be O
happy O
. O

None O
of O
you O
will O
die O
, O
but O
the O
ship O
will O
be O
lost O
. O

Last O
night O
an O
angel O
came O
to O
me O
from O
God O
-- O
the O
God O
I O
worship O
and O
belong O
to O
. O

The O
angel O
said O
, O
' O
Paul O
, O
do O
n't O
be O
afraid O
! O

You O
must O
stand O
before O
Caesar O
. O

And O
God O
has O
given O
you O
this O
promise O
: O
He O
will O
save O
the O
lives O
of O
all O
those O
sailing O
with O
you O
. O
' O

So O
men O
, O
there O
is O
nothing O
to O
worry O
about O
. O

I O
trust O
God O
, O
and O
I O
am O
sure O
everything O
will O
happen O
just O
as O
his O
angel O
told O
me O
. O

But O
we O
will O
crash O
on O
an O
island O
. O
'' O

On O
the O
fourteenth O
night O
we O
were O
still O
being O
blown O
around O
in O
the O
Adriatic O
Sea O
. O

The O
sailors O
thought O
we O
were O
close O
to O
land O
. O

They O
threw O
a O
rope O
into O
the O
water O
with O
a O
weight O
on O
the O
end O
of O
it O
. O

They O
found O
that O
the O
water O
was O
120 O
feet O
deep O
. O

They O
went O
a O
little O
farther O
and O
threw O
the O
rope O
in O
again O
. O

It O
was O
90 O
feet O
deep O
. O

The O
sailors O
were O
afraid O
that O
we O
would O
hit O
the O
rocks O
, O
so O
they O
threw O
four O
anchors O
into O
the O
water O
. O

Then O
they O
prayed O
for O
daylight O
to O
come O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
sailors O
wanted O
to O
leave O
the O
ship O
, O
and O
they O
lowered O
the O
lifeboat O
to O
the O
water O
. O

They O
wanted O
the O
other O
men O
to O
think O
that O
they O
were O
throwing O
more O
anchors O
from O
the O
front O
of O
the O
ship O
. O

But O
Paul O
told O
the O
army O
officer O
and O
the O
other O
soldiers O
, O
`` O
If O
these O
men O
do O
not O
stay O
in O
the O
ship O
, O
you O
will O
lose O
all O
hope O
of O
survival O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
soldiers O
cut O
the O
ropes O
and O
let O
the O
lifeboat O
fall O
into O
the O
water O
. O

Just O
before O
dawn O
Paul O
began O
persuading O
all O
the O
people O
to O
eat O
something O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
For O
the O
past O
two O
weeks O
you O
have O
been O
waiting O
and O
watching O
. O

You O
have O
not O
eaten O
for O
14 O
days O
. O

Now O
I O
beg O
you O
to O
eat O
something O
. O

You O
need O
it O
to O
stay O
alive O
. O

None O
of O
you O
will O
lose O
even O
one O
hair O
off O
your O
heads O
. O
'' O

After O
he O
said O
this O
, O
Paul O
took O
some O
bread O
and O
thanked O
God O
for O
it O
before O
all O
of O
them O
. O

He O
broke O
off O
a O
piece O
and O
began O
eating O
. O

All O
the O
men O
felt O
better O
and O
started O
eating O
too O
. O

-LRB- O
There O
were O
276 O
people O
on O
the O
ship O
. O
-RRB- O

We O
ate O
all O
we O
wanted O
. O

Then O
we O
began O
making O
the O
ship O
lighter O
by O
throwing O
the O
grain O
into O
the O
sea O
. O

When O
daylight O
came O
, O
the O
sailors O
saw O
land O
, O
but O
they O
did O
not O
know O
what O
land O
it O
was O
. O

They O
saw O
a O
bay O
with O
a O
beach O
and O
wanted O
to O
sail O
the O
ship O
to O
the O
beach O
if O
they O
could O
. O

So O
they O
cut O
the O
ropes O
to O
the O
anchors O
and O
left O
the O
anchors O
in O
the O
sea O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
they O
untied O
the O
ropes O
that O
were O
holding O
the O
rudders O
. O

Then O
they O
raised O
the O
front O
sail O
into O
the O
wind O
and O
sailed O
toward O
the O
beach O
. O

But O
the O
ship O
hit O
a O
sandbank O
. O

The O
front O
of O
the O
ship O
stuck O
there O
and O
could O
not O
move O
. O

Then O
the O
big O
waves O
began O
to O
break O
the O
back O
of O
the O
ship O
to O
pieces O
. O

The O
soldiers O
decided O
to O
kill O
the O
prisoners O
so O
that O
none O
of O
the O
prisoners O
could O
swim O
away O
and O
escape O
. O

But O
Julius O
the O
army O
officer O
wanted O
to O
let O
Paul O
live O
. O

So O
he O
did O
not O
allow O
the O
soldiers O
to O
kill O
the O
prisoners O
. O

He O
told O
the O
people O
who O
could O
swim O
to O
jump O
into O
the O
water O
and O
swim O
to O
land O
. O

The O
others O
used O
wooden O
boards O
or O
pieces O
of O
the O
ship O
. O

And O
this O
is O
how O
all O
the O
people O
went O
safely O
to O
land O
. O

Festus O
became O
governor O
, O
and O
three O
days O
later O
he O
went O
from O
Caesarea O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

The O
leading O
priests O
and O
the O
important O
Jewish O
leaders O
made O
charges O
against O
Paul O
before O
Festus O
. O

They O
asked O
Festus O
to O
do O
them O
a O
favor O
. O

They O
wanted O
him O
to O
send O
Paul O
back O
to O
Jerusalem O
because O
they O
had O
a O
plan O
to O
kill O
Paul O
on O
the O
way O
. O

But O
Festus O
answered O
, O
`` O
No O
, O
Paul O
will O
be O
kept O
in O
Caesarea O
. O

I O
will O
be O
going O
there O
soon O
myself O
, O
and O
your O
leaders O
can O
go O
with O
me O
. O

If O
this O
man O
has O
really O
done O
anything O
wrong O
, O
they O
can O
accuse O
him O
there O
. O
'' O

Festus O
stayed O
in O
Jerusalem O
another O
eight O
or O
ten O
days O
and O
then O
went O
back O
to O
Caesarea O
. O

The O
next O
day O
Festus O
told O
the O
soldiers O
to O
bring O
Paul O
before O
him O
. O

Festus O
was O
seated O
on O
the O
judgment O
seat O
. O

Paul O
came O
into O
the O
room O
, O
and O
the O
Jews O
who O
had O
come O
from O
Jerusalem O
stood O
around O
him O
. O

They O
made O
many O
serious O
charges O
against O
him O
, O
but O
they O
could O
not O
prove O
anything O
. O

Paul O
defended O
himself O
, O
saying O
, O
`` O
I O
have O
done O
nothing O
wrong O
against O
the O
Jewish O
law O
, O
against O
the O
Temple O
, O
or O
against O
Caesar O
. O
'' O

But O
Festus O
wanted O
to O
please O
the O
Jews O
. O

So O
he O
asked O
Paul O
, O
`` O
Do O
you O
want O
to O
go O
to O
Jerusalem O
for O
me O
to O
judge O
you O
there O
on O
these O
charges O
? O
'' O

Paul O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
standing O
at O
Caesar O
's O
judgment O
seat O
now O
. O

This O
is O
where O
I O
should O
be O
judged O
. O

I O
have O
done O
nothing O
wrong O
to O
the O
Jews O
, O
and O
you O
know O
it O
. O

If O
I O
have O
done O
something O
wrong O
, O
and O
the O
law O
says O
I O
must O
die O
, O
then O
I O
agree O
that O
I O
should O
die O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
ask O
to O
be O
saved O
from O
death O
. O

But O
if O
these O
charges O
are O
not O
true O
, O
then O
no O
one O
can O
hand O
me O
over O
to O
these O
people O
. O

No O
, O
I O
want O
Caesar O
to O
hear O
my O
case O
! O
'' O

Festus O
talked O
about O
this O
with O
his O
advisors O
. O

Then O
he O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
have O
asked O
to O
see O
Caesar O
, O
so O
you O
will O
go O
to O
Caesar O
! O
'' O

A O
few O
days O
later O
King O
Agrippa O
and O
Bernice O
came O
to O
Caesarea O
to O
visit O
Festus O
. O

They O
stayed O
there O
many O
days O
, O
and O
Festus O
told O
the O
king O
about O
Paul O
's O
case O
. O

Festus O
said O
, O
`` O
There O
is O
a O
man O
that O
Felix O
left O
in O
prison O
. O

When O
I O
went O
to O
Jerusalem O
, O
the O
leading O
priests O
and O
the O
older O
Jewish O
leaders O
there O
made O
charges O
against O
him O
. O

They O
wanted O
me O
to O
order O
his O
death O
. O

But O
I O
told O
them O
, O
' O
When O
a O
man O
is O
accused O
of O
doing O
something O
wrong O
, O
Romans O
do O
n't O
hand O
him O
over O
for O
others O
to O
judge O
. O

First O
, O
he O
must O
face O
the O
people O
accusing O
him O
. O

And O
then O
he O
must O
be O
allowed O
to O
defend O
himself O
against O
their O
charges O
. O
' O

`` O
So O
when O
these O
Jews O
came O
here O
for O
the O
trial O
, O
I O
did O
not O
waste O
time O
. O

The O
next O
day O
I O
sat O
on O
the O
judgment O
seat O
and O
ordered O
Paul O
to O
be O
brought O
in O
. O

The O
Jews O
stood O
up O
and O
accused O
him O
. O

But O
they O
did O
not O
accuse O
him O
of O
the O
kind O
of O
crimes O
I O
thought O
they O
would O
. O

Their O
charges O
were O
all O
about O
their O
own O
religion O
and O
about O
a O
man O
named O
Jesus O
. O

Jesus O
died O
, O
but O
Paul O
said O
that O
he O
is O
still O
alive O
. O

I O
did O
not O
have O
any O
idea O
about O
how O
to O
judge O
these O
matters O
. O

So O
I O
asked O
Paul O
, O
' O
Do O
you O
want O
to O
go O
to O
Jerusalem O
and O
be O
judged O
there O
? O
' O

But O
Paul O
asked O
to O
be O
kept O
in O
Caesarea O
. O

He O
wants O
a O
decision O
from O
the O
emperor O
. O

So O
I O
ordered O
that O
he O
be O
held O
until O
I O
could O
send O
him O
to O
Caesar O
in O
Rome O
. O
'' O

Agrippa O
said O
to O
Festus O
, O
`` O
I O
would O
like O
to O
hear O
this O
man O
too O
. O
'' O

Festus O
said O
, O
`` O
Tomorrow O
you O
can O
hear O
him O
. O
'' O

The O
next O
day O
Agrippa O
and O
Bernice O
came O
to O
the O
meeting O
with O
great O
show O
, O
acting O
like O
very O
important O
people O
. O

They O
entered O
the O
room O
with O
military O
leaders O
and O
important O
men O
of O
the O
city O
. O

Festus O
ordered O
the O
soldiers O
to O
bring O
Paul O
in O
. O

Festus O
said O
, O
`` O
King O
Agrippa O
and O
all O
of O
you O
gathered O
here O
with O
us O
, O
you O
see O
this O
man O
. O

All O
the O
Jewish O
people O
, O
here O
and O
in O
Jerusalem O
, O
have O
complained O
to O
me O
about O
him O
. O

When O
they O
complain O
about O
him O
, O
they O
shout O
that O
he O
should O
be O
killed O
. O

When O
I O
judged O
him O
, O
I O
did O
not O
find O
him O
guilty O
of O
any O
crime O
worthy O
of O
death O
. O

But O
he O
asked O
to O
be O
judged O
by O
Caesar O
, O
so O
I O
decided O
to O
send O
him O
to O
Rome O
. O

However O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
really O
know O
what O
to O
tell O
Caesar O
that O
this O
man O
has O
done O
wrong O
. O

So O
I O
have O
brought O
him O
before O
all O
of O
you O
-- O
especially O
you O
, O
King O
Agrippa O
. O

I O
hope O
that O
you O
can O
question O
him O
and O
give O
me O
something O
to O
write O
to O
Caesar O
. O

I O
think O
it O
is O
foolish O
to O
send O
a O
prisoner O
to O
Caesar O
without O
making O
some O
charges O
against O
him O
. O
'' O

When O
the O
day O
of O
Pentecost O
came O
, O
they O
were O
all O
together O
in O
one O
place O
. O

Suddenly O
a O
noise O
came O
from O
heaven O
. O

It O
sounded O
like O
a O
strong O
wind O
blowing O
. O

This O
noise O
filled O
the O
whole O
house O
where O
they O
were O
sitting O
. O

They O
saw O
something O
that O
looked O
like O
flames O
of O
fire O
. O

The O
flames O
were O
separated O
and O
stood O
over O
each O
person O
there O
. O

They O
were O
all O
filled O
with O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
, O
and O
they O
began O
to O
speak O
different O
languages O
. O

The O
Holy O
Spirit O
was O
giving O
them O
the O
power O
to O
do O
this O
. O

There O
were O
some O
godly O
Jews O
in O
Jerusalem O
at O
this O
time O
. O

They O
were O
from O
every O
country O
in O
the O
world O
. O

A O
large O
crowd O
came O
together O
because O
they O
heard O
the O
noise O
. O

They O
were O
surprised O
because O
, O
as O
the O
apostles O
were O
speaking O
, O
everyone O
heard O
in O
their O
own O
language O
. O

They O
were O
all O
amazed O
at O
this O
. O

They O
did O
not O
understand O
how O
the O
apostles O
could O
do O
this O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Look O
! O

These O
men O
we O
hear O
speaking O
are O
all O
from O
Galilee O
. O

But O
we O
hear O
them O
in O
our O
own O
languages O
. O

How O
is O
this O
possible O
? O

We O
are O
from O
all O
these O
different O
places O
: O
Parthia O
, O
Media O
, O
Elam O
, O
Mesopotamia O
, O
Judea O
, O
Cappadocia O
, O
Pontus O
, O
Asia O

the O
areas O
of O
Libya O
near O
the O
city O
of O
Cyrene O
, O
Rome O
, O
Crete O
, O
and O
Arabia O
. O

Some O
of O
us O
were O
born O
Jews O
, O
and O
others O
have O
changed O
their O
religion O
to O
worship O
God O
like O
Jews O
. O

We O
are O
from O
these O
different O
countries O
, O
but O
we O
can O
hear O
these O
men O
in O
our O
own O
languages O
! O

We O
can O
all O
understand O
the O
great O
things O
they O
are O
saying O
about O
God O
. O
'' O

The O
people O
were O
all O
amazed O
and O
confused O
. O

They O
asked O
each O
other O
, O
`` O
What O
is O
happening O
? O
'' O

But O
others O
were O
laughing O
at O
the O
apostles O
, O
saying O
they O
were O
drunk O
from O
too O
much O
wine O
. O

Then O
Peter O
stood O
up O
with O
the O
other O
eleven O
apostles O
. O

He O
spoke O
loudly O
so O
that O
all O
the O
people O
could O
hear O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
My O
Jewish O
brothers O

all O
of O
you O
who O
live O
in O
Jerusalem O

listen O
to O
me O

I O
will O
tell O
you O
something O
you O
need O
to O
know O

Listen O
carefully O

These O
men O
are O
not O
drunk O
as O
you O
think O
; O
it O
's O
only O
nine O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning O
. O

But O
Joel O
the O
prophet O
wrote O
about O
what O
you O
see O
happening O
here O
today O
. O

This O
is O
what O
he O
wrote O
: O
' O
God O
says O
: O
In O
the O
last O
days O
I O
will O
pour O
out O
my O
Spirit O
on O
all O
people O

Your O
sons O
and O
daughters O
will O
prophesy O

Your O
young O
men O
will O
see O
visions O

Your O
old O
men O
will O
have O
special O
dreams O

In O
those O
days O
I O
will O
pour O
out O
my O
Spirit O
on O
my O
servants O

they O
will O
prophesy O

I O
will O
work O
wonders O
in O
the O
sky O
above O

I O
will O
cause O
miraculous O
signs O
on O
the O
earth O
below O

There O
will O
be O
blood O

fire O

and O
thick O
smoke O

The O
sun O
will O
be O
changed O
into O
darkness O

and O
the O
moon O
will O
be O
as O
red O
as O
blood O

Then O
the O
great O
and O
glorious O
day O
of O
the O
Lord O
will O
come O

And O
everyone O
who O
trusts O
in O
the O
Lord O
will O
be O
saved O

' O

`` O
My O
fellow O
Israelites O
, O
listen O
to O
these O
words O
: O

Jesus O
from O
Nazareth O
was O
a O
very O
special O
man O
. O

God O
clearly O
showed O
this O
to O
you O
. O

He O
proved O
it O
by O
the O
miracles O
, O
wonders O
, O
and O
miraculous O
signs O
he O
did O
through O
Jesus O
. O

You O
all O
saw O
these O
things O
, O
so O
you O
know O
this O
is O
true O
. O

Jesus O
was O
handed O
over O
to O
you O
, O
and O
you O
killed O
him O
. O

With O
the O
help O
of O
evil O
men O
, O
you O
nailed O
him O
to O
a O
cross O
. O

But O
God O
knew O
all O
this O
would O
happen O
. O

It O
was O
his O
plan O
-- O
a O
plan O
he O
made O
long O
ago O
. O

Jesus O
suffered O
the O
pain O
of O
death O
, O
but O
God O
made O
him O
free O
. O

He O
raised O
him O
from O
death O
. O

There O
was O
no O
way O
for O
death O
to O
hold O
him O
. O

David O
said O
this O
about O
him O
: O
' O
I O
saw O
the O
Lord O
before O
me O
always O
; O
he O
is O
at O
my O
right O
side O
to O
keep O
me O
safe O

So O
my O
heart O
is O
happy O
, O
and O
the O
words O
I O
speak O
are O
words O
of O
joy O
. O

Yes O
, O
even O
my O
body O
will O
live O
with O
hope O
, O
because O
you O
will O
not O
leave O
me O
in O
the O
place O
of O
death O
. O

You O
will O
not O
let O
the O
body O
of O
your O
Holy O
One O
rot O
in O
the O
grave O
. O

You O
taught O
me O
how O
to O
live O

You O
will O
come O
close O
to O
me O
and O
give O
me O
great O
joy O

`` O
My O
brothers O
, O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
for O
sure O
about O
David O
, O
our O
great O
ancestor O
. O

He O
died O
, O
was O
buried O
, O
and O
his O
tomb O
is O
still O
here O
with O
us O
today O
. O

He O
was O
a O
prophet O
and O
knew O
something O
that O
God O
had O
said O
. O

God O
had O
promised O
David O
that O
someone O
from O
his O
own O
family O
would O
sit O
on O
David O
's O
throne O
as O
king O
. O

David O
knew O
this O
before O
it O
happened O
. O

That O
is O
why O
he O
said O
this O
about O
that O
future O
king O
: O
' O
He O
was O
not O
left O
in O
the O
place O
of O
death O
. O

His O
body O
did O
not O
rot O
in O
the O
grave O
. O
' O

David O
was O
talking O
about O
the O
Christ O
rising O
from O
death O
. O

So O
Jesus O
is O
the O
one O
God O
raised O
from O
death O
. O

We O
are O
all O
witnesses O
of O
this O
. O

We O
saw O
him O

Jesus O
was O
lifted O
up O
to O
heaven O
. O

Now O
he O
is O
with O
God O
, O
at O
God O
's O
right O
side O
. O

The O
Father O
has O
given O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
to O
him O
, O
as O
he O
promised O
. O

So O
Jesus O
has O
now O
poured O
out O
that O
Spirit O
. O

This O
is O
what O
you O
see O
and O
hear O
. O

David O
was O
not O
the O
one O
who O
was O
lifted O
up O
to O
heaven O
. O

David O
himself O
said O
, O
' O
The O
Lord O
God O
said O
to O
my O
Lord O
: O
Sit O
at O
my O
right O
side O
, O
until O
I O
put O
your O
enemies O
under O
your O
power O
. O
' O

`` O
So O
, O
all O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
should O
know O
this O
for O
certain O
: O
God O
has O
made O
Jesus O
to O
be O
Lord O
and O
Christ O
. O

He O
is O
the O
man O
you O
nailed O
to O
the O
cross O
! O
'' O

When O
the O
people O
heard O
this O
, O
they O
felt O
very O
, O
very O
sorry O
. O

They O
asked O
Peter O
and O
the O
other O
apostles O
, O
`` O
Brothers O
, O
what O
should O
we O
do O
? O
'' O

Peter O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Change O
your O
hearts O
and O
lives O
and O
be O
baptized O
, O
each O
one O
of O
you O
, O
in O
the O
name O
of O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

Then O
God O
will O
forgive O
your O
sins O
, O
and O
you O
will O
receive O
the O
gift O
of O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
. O

This O
promise O
is O
for O
you O
. O

It O
is O
also O
for O
your O
children O
and O
for O
the O
people O
who O
are O
far O
away O
. O

It O
is O
for O
everyone O
the O
Lord O
our O
God O
calls O
to O
himself O
. O
'' O

Peter O
warned O
them O
with O
many O
other O
words O
; O
he O
begged O
them O
, O
`` O
Save O
yourselves O
from O
the O
evil O
of O
the O
people O
who O
live O
now O
! O
'' O

Then O
those O
who O
accepted O
what O
Peter O
said O
were O
baptized O
. O

On O
that O
day O
about O
3000 O
people O
were O
added O
to O
the O
group O
of O
believers O
. O

The O
believers O
spent O
their O
time O
listening O
to O
the O
teaching O
of O
the O
apostles O
. O

They O
shared O
everything O
with O
each O
other O
. O

They O
ate O
together O
and O
prayed O
together O
. O

Many O
wonders O
and O
miraculous O
signs O
were O
happening O
through O
the O
apostles O
, O
and O
everyone O
felt O
great O
respect O
for O
God O
. O

All O
the O
believers O
stayed O
together O
and O
shared O
everything O
. O

They O
sold O
their O
land O
and O
the O
things O
they O
owned O
. O

Then O
they O
divided O
the O
money O
and O
gave O
it O
to O
those O
who O
needed O
it O
. O

The O
believers O
shared O
a O
common O
purpose O
, O
and O
every O
day O
they O
spent O
much O
of O
their O
time O
together O
in O
the O
Temple O
area O
. O

They O
also O
ate O
together O
in O
their O
homes O
. O

They O
were O
happy O
to O
share O
their O
food O
and O
ate O
with O
joyful O
hearts O
. O

The O
believers O
praised O
God O
and O
were O
respected O
by O
all O
the O
people O
. O

More O
and O
more O
people O
were O
being O
saved O
every O
day O
, O
and O
the O
Lord O
was O
adding O
them O
to O
their O
group O
. O

More O
and O
more O
people O
were O
becoming O
followers O
of O
Jesus O
. O

But O
during O
this O
same O
time O
, O
the O
Greek O
- O
speaking O
followers O
began O
to O
complain O
against O
the O
other O
Jewish O
followers O
. O

They O
said O
that O
their O
widows O
were O
not O
getting O
their O
share O
of O
what O
the O
followers O
received O
every O
day O
. O

The O
twelve O
apostles O
called O
the O
whole O
group O
of O
followers O
together O
. O

The O
apostles O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
It O
would O
not O
be O
right O
for O
us O
to O
give O
up O
our O
work O
of O
teaching O
God O
's O
word O
in O
order O
to O
be O
in O
charge O
of O
getting O
food O
to O
people O
. O

So O
, O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
choose O
seven O
of O
your O
men O
who O
have O
a O
good O
reputation O
. O

They O
must O
be O
full O
of O
wisdom O
and O
the O
Spirit O
. O

We O
will O
give O
them O
this O
work O
to O
do O
. O

Then O
we O
can O
use O
all O
our O
time O
to O
pray O
and O
to O
teach O
the O
word O
of O
God O
. O
'' O

The O
whole O
group O
liked O
the O
idea O
. O

So O
they O
chose O
these O
seven O
men O
: O
Stephen O
-LRB- O
a O
man O
with O
great O
faith O
and O
full O
of O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
-RRB- O
, O
Philip O
, O
Prochorus O
, O
Nicanor O
, O
Timon O
, O
Parmenas O
, O
and O
Nicolaus O
-LRB- O
a O
man O
from O
Antioch O
who O
had O
become O
a O
Jew O
-RRB- O
. O

Then O
they O
put O
these O
men O
before O
the O
apostles O
, O
who O
prayed O
and O
laid O
their O
hands O
on O
them O
. O

The O
word O
of O
God O
was O
reaching O
more O
and O
more O
people O
. O

The O
group O
of O
followers O
in O
Jerusalem O
became O
larger O
and O
larger O
. O

Even O
a O
big O
group O
of O
Jewish O
priests O
believed O
and O
obeyed O
. O

Stephen O
received O
a O
great O
blessing O
. O

God O
gave O
him O
power O
to O
do O
great O
wonders O
and O
miraculous O
signs O
among O
the O
people O
. O

But O
some O
of O
the O
Jews O
there O
were O
from O
the O
synagogue O
of O
Free O
Men O
, O
as O
it O
was O
called O
. O

The O
group O
included O
Jews O
from O
Cyrene O
, O
Alexandria O
, O
Cilicia O
, O
and O
Asia O
. O

They O
started O
arguing O
with O
Stephen O
. O

But O
the O
Spirit O
was O
helping O
him O
speak O
with O
wisdom O
. O

His O
words O
were O
so O
strong O
that O
these O
Jews O
could O
not O
argue O
with O
him O
. O

So O
they O
told O
some O
men O
to O
say O
, O
`` O
We O
heard O
Stephen O
say O
bad O
things O
against O
Moses O
and O
against O
God O
! O
'' O

By O
doing O
this O
, O
these O
Jews O
upset O
the O
people O
, O
the O
older O
Jewish O
leaders O
, O
and O
the O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
. O

They O
became O
so O
angry O
that O
they O
came O
and O
grabbed O
Stephen O
and O
took O
him O
to O
a O
meeting O
of O
the O
high O
council O
. O

The O
Jews O
brought O
some O
men O
into O
the O
meeting O
to O
tell O
lies O
about O
Stephen O
. O

These O
men O
said O
, O
`` O
This O
man O
is O
always O
saying O
things O
against O
this O
holy O
place O
and O
against O
the O
Law O
of O
Moses O
. O

We O
heard O
him O
say O
that O
Jesus O
from O
Nazareth O
will O
destroy O
this O
place O
and O
change O
what O
Moses O
told O
us O
to O
do O
. O
'' O

Everyone O
there O
in O
the O
council O
meeting O
was O
staring O
at O
Stephen O
. O

They O
saw O
that O
his O
face O
looked O
like O
the O
face O
of O
an O
angel O
. O

When O
we O
were O
safe O
on O
land O
, O
we O
learned O
that O
the O
island O
was O
called O
Malta O
. O

The O
people O
who O
lived O
there O
were O
very O
good O
to O
us O
. O

It O
was O
raining O
and O
very O
cold O
, O
so O
they O
built O
a O
fire O
and O
welcomed O
all O
of O
us O
. O

Paul O
gathered O
a O
pile O
of O
sticks O
for O
the O
fire O
. O

He O
was O
putting O
the O
sticks O
on O
the O
fire O
, O
and O
a O
poisonous O
snake O
came O
out O
because O
of O
the O
heat O
and O
bit O
him O
on O
the O
hand O
. O

When O
the O
people O
living O
on O
the O
island O
saw O
the O
snake O
hanging O
from O
his O
hand O
, O
they O
said O
, O
`` O
This O
man O
must O
be O
a O
murderer O
! O

He O
did O
not O
die O
in O
the O
sea O
, O
but O
Justice O
does O
not O
want O
him O
to O
live O
. O
'' O

But O
Paul O
shook O
the O
snake O
off O
into O
the O
fire O
and O
was O
not O
hurt O
. O

The O
people O
thought O
he O
would O
swell O
up O
or O
fall O
down O
dead O
. O

They O
waited O
and O
watched O
him O
for O
a O
long O
time O
, O
but O
nothing O
bad O
happened O
to O
him O
. O

So O
they O
changed O
their O
opinion O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
He O
is O
a O
god O
! O
'' O

There O
were O
some O
fields O
around O
that O
same O
area O
. O

They O
were O
owned O
by O
a O
man O
named O
Publius O
, O
the O
most O
important O
Roman O
official O
on O
the O
island O
. O

He O
welcomed O
us O
into O
his O
home O
and O
was O
very O
good O
to O
us O
. O

We O
stayed O
in O
his O
house O
for O
three O
days O
. O

Publius O
' O
father O
was O
very O
sick O
. O

He O
had O
a O
fever O
and O
dysentery O
, O
but O
Paul O
went O
to O
him O
and O
prayed O
for O
him O
. O

He O
laid O
his O
hands O
on O
the O
man O
and O
healed O
him O
. O

After O
this O
happened O
, O
all O
the O
other O
sick O
people O
on O
the O
island O
came O
to O
Paul O
, O
and O
he O
healed O
them O
too O
. O

The O
people O
on O
the O
island O
gave O
us O
many O
honors O
. O

And O
after O
we O
had O
been O
there O
three O
months O
and O
were O
ready O
to O
leave O
, O
they O
provided O
us O
everything O
we O
needed O
for O
our O
trip O
. O

We O
got O
on O
a O
ship O
from O
Alexandria O
that O
had O
stayed O
on O
the O
island O
of O
Malta O
during O
the O
winter O
. O

On O
the O
front O
of O
the O
ship O
was O
the O
sign O
for O
the O
twin O
gods O
. O

We O
stopped O
at O
the O
city O
of O
Syracuse O
. O

We O
stayed O
there O
three O
days O
and O
then O
left O
. O

We O
came O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Rhegium O
. O

The O
next O
day O
a O
wind O
began O
to O
blow O
from O
the O
southwest O
, O
so O
we O
were O
able O
to O
leave O
. O

A O
day O
later O
we O
came O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Puteoli O
. O

We O
found O
some O
believers O
there O
, O
who O
asked O
us O
to O
stay O
with O
them O
a O
week O
. O

Finally O
, O
we O
came O
to O
Rome O
. O

The O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
in O
Rome O
heard O
about O
us O
and O
came O
out O
to O
meet O
us O
at O
the O
Market O
of O
Appius O
and O
at O
the O
Three O
Inns O
. O

When O
Paul O
saw O
these O
believers O
, O
he O
thanked O
God O
and O
felt O
encouraged O
. O

When O
we O
came O
to O
Rome O
, O
Paul O
was O
allowed O
to O
live O
alone O
. O

But O
a O
soldier O
stayed O
with O
him O
to O
guard O
him O
. O

Three O
days O
later O
Paul O
sent O
for O
some O
of O
the O
most O
important O
Jews O
. O

When O
they O
came O
together O
, O
he O
said O
, O
`` O
My O
brothers O
, O
I O
have O
done O
nothing O
against O
our O
people O
or O
against O
the O
customs O
of O
our O
fathers O
. O

But O
I O
was O
arrested O
in O
Jerusalem O
and O
handed O
over O
to O
the O
Romans O
. O

They O
asked O
me O
many O
questions O
, O
but O
they O
could O
not O
find O
any O
reason O
why O
I O
should O
be O
put O
to O
death O
. O

So O
they O
wanted O
to O
let O
me O
go O
free O
. O

But O
the O
Jews O
there O
did O
not O
want O
that O
. O

So O
I O
had O
to O
ask O
to O
come O
to O
Rome O
to O
have O
my O
trial O
before O
Caesar O
. O

That O
does O
n't O
mean O
I O
am O
accusing O
my O
people O
of O
doing O
anything O
wrong O
. O

That O
is O
why O
I O
wanted O
to O
see O
you O
and O
talk O
with O
you O
. O

I O
am O
bound O
with O
this O
chain O
because O
I O
believe O
in O
the O
hope O
of O
Israel O
. O
'' O

The O
Jews O
answered O
Paul O
, O
`` O
We O
have O
received O
no O
letters O
from O
Judea O
about O
you O
. O

None O
of O
our O
Jewish O
brothers O
who O
have O
traveled O
from O
there O
brought O
news O
about O
you O
or O
told O
us O
anything O
bad O
about O
you O
. O

We O
want O
to O
hear O
your O
ideas O
. O

We O
know O
that O
people O
everywhere O
are O
speaking O
against O
this O
new O
group O
. O
'' O

Paul O
and O
the O
Jews O
chose O
a O
day O
for O
a O
meeting O
. O

On O
that O
day O
many O
more O
of O
these O
Jews O
met O
with O
Paul O
at O
his O
house O
. O

He O
spoke O
to O
them O
all O
day O
long O
, O
explaining O
God O
's O
kingdom O
to O
them O
. O

He O
used O
the O
Law O
of O
Moses O
and O
the O
writings O
of O
the O
prophets O
to O
persuade O
them O
to O
believe O
in O
Jesus O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
Jews O
believed O
what O
he O
said O
, O
but O
others O
did O
not O
believe O
. O

They O
had O
an O
argument O
among O
themselves O
and O
were O
ready O
to O
leave O
. O

But O
Paul O
said O
one O
more O
thing O
to O
them O
: O
`` O
The O
Holy O
Spirit O
spoke O
the O
truth O
to O
your O
fathers O
through O
Isaiah O
the O
prophet O
. O

He O
said O
, O
' O
Go O
to O
this O
people O
and O
tell O
them O
: O
You O
will O
listen O
and O
you O
will O
hear O
, O
but O
you O
will O
not O
understand O
. O

You O
will O
look O
and O
you O
will O
see O
, O
but O
you O
will O
not O
understand O
what O
you O
see O
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
minds O
of O
these O
people O
are O
now O
closed O
. O

They O
have O
ears O
, O
but O
they O
do O
n't O
listen O
. O

They O
have O
eyes O
, O
but O
they O
refuse O
to O
see O
. O

If O
their O
minds O
were O
not O
closed O
, O
they O
might O
see O
with O
their O
eyes O
; O
they O
might O
hear O
with O
their O
ears O
; O
they O
might O
understand O
with O
their O
minds O
. O

Then O
they O
might O
turn O
back O
to O
me O
and O
be O
healed O
. O
' O

`` O
I O
want O
you O
Jews O
to O
know O
that O
God O
has O
sent O
his O
salvation O
to O
the O
non-Jewish O
people O
. O

They O
will O
listen O
! O
'' O

Paul O
stayed O
two O
full O
years O
in O
his O
own O
rented O
house O
. O

He O
welcomed O
all O
the O
people O
who O
came O
and O
visited O
him O
. O

He O
told O
them O
about O
God O
's O
kingdom O
and O
taught O
them O
about O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

He O
was O
very O
bold O
, O
and O
no O
one O
tried O
to O
stop O
him O
from O
speaking O
. O

Paul O
and O
Barnabas O
went O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Iconium O
. O

As O
they O
did O
in O
Antioch O
, O
they O
entered O
the O
Jewish O
synagogue O
. O

They O
spoke O
to O
the O
people O
there O
. O

They O
spoke O
so O
well O
that O
many O
Jews O
and O
Greeks O
believed O
what O
they O
said O
. O

But O
some O
of O
the O
Jews O
did O
not O
believe O
. O

They O
said O
things O
that O
caused O
the O
non-Jewish O
people O
to O
be O
angry O
and O
turn O
against O
the O
Lord O
's O
followers O
. O

So O
Paul O
and O
Barnabas O
stayed O
in O
Iconium O
a O
long O
time O
, O
and O
they O
spoke O
bravely O
for O
the O
Lord O
. O

They O
told O
the O
people O
about O
God O
's O
grace O
. O

The O
Lord O
proved O
that O
what O
they O
said O
was O
true O
by O
causing O
miraculous O
signs O
and O
wonders O
to O
be O
done O
through O
them O
. O

But O
some O
of O
the O
people O
in O
the O
city O
agreed O
with O
the O
Jews O
who O
did O
not O
believe O
Paul O
and O
Barnabas O
. O

Others O
followed O
the O
apostles O
. O

So O
the O
city O
was O
divided O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
Jews O
there O
, O
as O
well O
as O
their O
leaders O
and O
some O
of O
the O
non-Jewish O
people O
, O
were O
determined O
to O
hurt O
Paul O
and O
Barnabas O
. O

They O
wanted O
to O
stone O
them O
to O
death O
. O

When O
Paul O
and O
Barnabas O
learned O
about O
this O
, O
they O
left O
the O
city O
. O

They O
went O
to O
Lystra O
and O
Derbe O
, O
cities O
in O
Lycaonia O
, O
and O
to O
the O
surrounding O
areas O
. O

They O
told O
the O
Good O
News O
there O
too O
. O

In O
Lystra O
there O
was O
a O
man O
who O
had O
something O
wrong O
with O
his O
feet O
. O

He O
had O
been O
born O
crippled O
and O
had O
never O
walked O
. O

He O
was O
sitting O
and O
listening O
to O
Paul O
speak O
. O

Paul O
looked O
straight O
at O
him O
and O
saw O
that O
the O
man O
believed O
God O
could O
heal O
him O
. O

So O
Paul O
shouted O
, O
`` O
Stand O
up O
on O
your O
feet O
! O
'' O

The O
man O
jumped O
up O
and O
began O
walking O
around O
. O

When O
the O
people O
saw O
what O
Paul O
did O
, O
they O
shouted O
in O
their O
own O
Lycaonian O
language O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
gods O
have O
come O
down O
to O
us O
in O
the O
form O
of O
humans O
! O
'' O

The O
people O
began O
to O
call O
Barnabas O
`` O
Zeus O
, O
'' O
and O
they O
called O
Paul O
`` O
Hermes O
, O
'' O
because O
he O
was O
the O
main O
speaker O
. O

The O
temple O
of O
Zeus O
was O
near O
the O
city O
. O

The O
priest O
of O
this O
temple O
brought O
some O
bulls O
and O
flowers O
to O
the O
city O
gates O
. O

The O
priest O
and O
the O
people O
wanted O
to O
offer O
a O
sacrifice O
to O
Paul O
and O
Barnabas O
. O

But O
when O
the O
apostles O
, O
Barnabas O
and O
Paul O
, O
understood O
what O
the O
people O
were O
doing O
, O
they O
tore O
their O
own O
clothes O
. O

Then O
they O
ran O
in O
among O
the O
people O
and O
shouted O
to O
them O
: O
`` O
Men O
, O
why O
are O
you O
doing O
this O
? O

We O
are O
not O
gods O
. O

We O
are O
human O
just O
like O
you O
. O

We O
came O
to O
tell O
you O
the O
Good O
News O
. O

We O
are O
telling O
you O
to O
turn O
away O
from O
these O
worthless O
things O
. O

Turn O
to O
the O
true O
living O
God O
, O
the O
one O
who O
made O
the O
sky O
, O
the O
earth O
, O
the O
sea O
, O
and O
everything O
that O
is O
in O
them O
. O

`` O
In O
the O
past O
God O
let O
all O
the O
nations O
do O
what O
they O
wanted O
. O

But O
God O
was O
always O
there O
doing O
the O
good O
things O
that O
prove O
he O
is O
real O
. O

He O
gives O
you O
rain O
from O
heaven O
and O
good O
harvests O
at O
the O
right O
times O
. O

He O
gives O
you O
plenty O
of O
food O
and O
fills O
your O
hearts O
with O
joy O
. O
'' O

Even O
after O
saying O
all O
this O
, O
Paul O
and O
Barnabas O
still O
could O
hardly O
stop O
the O
people O
from O
offering O
sacrifices O
to O
them O
. O

Then O
some O
Jews O
came O
from O
Antioch O
and O
Iconium O
and O
persuaded O
the O
people O
to O
turn O
against O
Paul O
. O

So O
they O
threw O
stones O
at O
him O
and O
dragged O
him O
out O
of O
the O
town O
. O

They O
thought O
they O
had O
killed O
him O
. O

But O
when O
the O
followers O
of O
Jesus O
gathered O
around O
him O
, O
he O
got O
up O
and O
went O
back O
into O
the O
town O
. O

The O
next O
day O
he O
and O
Barnabas O
left O
and O
went O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Derbe O
. O

They O
also O
told O
the O
Good O
News O
in O
the O
city O
of O
Derbe O
, O
and O
many O
people O
became O
followers O
of O
Jesus O
. O

Then O
Paul O
and O
Barnabas O
returned O
to O
the O
cities O
of O
Lystra O
, O
Iconium O
, O
and O
Antioch O
. O

In O
those O
cities O
they O
helped O
the O
followers O
grow O
stronger O
in O
their O
faith O
and O
encouraged O
them O
to O
continue O
trusting O
God O
. O

They O
told O
them O
, O
`` O
We O
must O
suffer O
many O
things O
on O
our O
way O
into O
God O
's O
kingdom O
. O
'' O

They O
also O
chose O
elders O
for O
each O
church O
and O
stopped O
eating O
for O
a O
period O
of O
time O
to O
pray O
for O
them O
. O

These O
elders O
were O
men O
who O
had O
put O
their O
trust O
in O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
, O
so O
Paul O
and O
Barnabas O
put O
them O
in O
his O
care O
. O

Paul O
and O
Barnabas O
went O
through O
the O
country O
of O
Pisidia O
. O

Then O
they O
came O
to O
the O
country O
of O
Pamphylia O
. O

They O
told O
people O
the O
message O
of O
God O
in O
the O
city O
of O
Perga O
, O
and O
then O
they O
went O
down O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Attalia O
. O

And O
from O
there O
they O
sailed O
away O
to O
Antioch O
in O
Syria O
. O

This O
is O
the O
city O
where O
the O
believers O
had O
put O
them O
into O
God O
's O
care O
and O
sent O
them O
to O
do O
this O
work O
. O

Now O
they O
had O
finished O
it O
. O

When O
they O
arrived O
, O
they O
gathered O
the O
church O
together O
and O
told O
them O
about O
all O
that O
God O
had O
done O
with O
them O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
God O
opened O
a O
door O
so O
that O
the O
non-Jewish O
people O
could O
also O
believe O
! O
'' O

And O
they O
stayed O
there O
a O
long O
time O
with O
the O
Lord O
's O
followers O
. O

The O
high O
priest O
said O
to O
Stephen O
, O
`` O
Is O
all O
this O
true O
? O
'' O

Stephen O
answered O
, O
`` O
My O
Jewish O
fathers O
and O
brothers O
, O
listen O
to O
me O
. O

Our O
great O
and O
glorious O
God O
appeared O
to O
Abraham O
, O
our O
ancestor O
, O
when O
he O
was O
in O
Mesopotamia O
. O

This O
was O
before O
he O
lived O
in O
Haran O
. O

God O
said O
to O
him O
, O
' O
Leave O
your O
country O
and O
your O
people O
, O
and O
go O
to O
the O
country O
I O
will O
show O
you O
. O
' O

`` O
So O
Abraham O
left O
the O
country O
of O
Chaldea O
. O

He O
went O
to O
live O
in O
Haran O
. O

After O
his O
father O
died O
, O
God O
sent O
him O
to O
this O
place O
, O
where O
you O
live O
now O
. O

But O
God O
did O
not O
give O
Abraham O
any O
of O
this O
land O
, O
not O
even O
a O
foot O
of O
it O
. O

But O
God O
promised O
that O
in O
the O
future O
he O
would O
give O
Abraham O
this O
land O
for O
himself O
and O
for O
his O
children O
. O

This O
was O
before O
Abraham O
had O
any O
children O
. O

`` O
This O
is O
what O
God O
said O
to O
him O
: O
' O
Your O
descendants O
will O
live O
in O
another O
country O
. O

They O
will O
be O
strangers O
. O

The O
people O
there O
will O
make O
them O
slaves O
and O
do O
bad O
things O
to O
them O
for O
400 O
years O
. O

But O
I O
will O
punish O
the O
nation O
that O
made O
them O
slaves O
. O
' O

And O
God O
also O
said O
, O
' O
After O
those O
things O
happen O
, O
your O
people O
will O
come O
out O
of O
that O
country O

Then O
they O
will O
worship O
me O
here O
in O
this O
place O

' O

`` O
God O
made O
an O
agreement O
with O
Abraham O
; O
the O
sign O
for O
this O
agreement O
was O
circumcision O
. O

And O
so O
when O
Abraham O
had O
a O
son O
, O
he O
circumcised O
him O
when O
he O
was O
eight O
days O
old O
. O

His O
son O
's O
name O
was O
Isaac O
. O

Isaac O
also O
circumcised O
his O
son O
Jacob O
. O

And O
Jacob O
did O
the O
same O
for O
his O
sons O
who O
became O
the O
twelve O
great O
ancestors O
of O
our O
people O
. O

`` O
These O
ancestors O
of O
ours O
became O
jealous O
of O
their O
brother O
Joseph O
and O
sold O
him O
to O
be O
a O
slave O
in O
Egypt O
. O

But O
God O
was O
with O
him O
and O
saved O
him O
from O
all O
his O
troubles O
. O

Pharaoh O
was O
the O
king O
of O
Egypt O
then O
. O

He O
liked O
Joseph O
and O
respected O
him O
because O
of O
the O
wisdom O
God O
gave O
him O
. O

Pharaoh O
gave O
Joseph O
the O
job O
of O
being O
a O
governor O
of O
Egypt O
. O

He O
even O
let O
him O
rule O
over O
all O
the O
people O
in O
Pharaoh O
's O
house O
. O

But O
all O
the O
land O
of O
Egypt O
and O
of O
Canaan O
became O
dry O
. O

It O
became O
so O
dry O
that O
food O
could O
not O
grow O
, O
and O
the O
people O
suffered O
very O
much O
. O

Our O
people O
could O
not O
find O
anything O
to O
eat O
. O

`` O
But O
Jacob O
heard O
that O
there O
was O
food O
in O
Egypt O
. O

So O
he O
sent O
our O
people O
there O
. O

This O
was O
their O
first O
trip O
to O
Egypt O
. O

Then O
they O
went O
there O
a O
second O
time O
. O

This O
time O
Joseph O
told O
his O
brothers O
who O
he O
was O
. O

And O
Pharaoh O
learned O
about O
Joseph O
's O
family O
. O

Then O
Joseph O
sent O
some O
men O
to O
tell O
Jacob O
, O
his O
father O
, O
to O
come O
to O
Egypt O
. O

He O
also O
invited O
all O
his O
relatives O
, O
a O
total O
of O
75 O
people O
. O

So O
Jacob O
went O
down O
to O
Egypt O
. O

He O
and O
our O
other O
ancestors O
lived O
there O
until O
they O
died O
. O

Later O
, O
their O
bodies O
were O
moved O
to O
Shechem O
, O
where O
they O
were O
put O
in O
a O
tomb O
. O

It O
was O
the O
same O
tomb O
that O
Abraham O
had O
bought O
in O
Shechem O
from O
the O
sons O
of O
Hamor O
. O

He O
paid O
them O
with O
silver O
. O

`` O
The O
number O
of O
our O
people O
in O
Egypt O
grew O

There O
were O
more O

more O
of O
our O
people O
there O
. O

The O
promise O
that O
God O
made O
to O
Abraham O
was O
soon O
to O
come O
true O
. O

Then O
a O
different O
king O
began O
to O
rule O
Egypt O
, O
one O
who O
knew O
nothing O
about O
Joseph O
. O

This O
king O
tricked O
our O
people O

He O
treated O
them O
badly O
, O
making O
them O
leave O
their O
children O
outside O
to O
die O

`` O
This O
was O
the O
time O

Moses O

was O
a O
very O
beautiful O
child O

and O
for O
three O
months O
his O
parents O
took O
care O

him O
at O
home O

When O
they O
put O
him O
outside O

Pharaoh O

daughter O
took O
him O

She O
raised O
him O
as O
her O
own O
son O

The O
Egyptians O
taught O
Moses O
everything O
they O
knew O

He O
was O
powerful O
in O
all O
he O
said O

did O

`` O
When O
Moses O
was O
about O
40 O
years O
old O

he O
decided O
to O
visit O
his O
own O
people O

the O
people O
of O
Israel O

He O
saw O
one O
of O
them O
being O
mistreated O
by O
an O
Egyptian O

so O
he O
defended O
him O

Moses O
hit O
the O
Egyptian O
to O
pay O
him O
back O
for O
hurting O
the O
man O

He O
hit O
him O
so O
hard O
that O
it O
killed O
him O

Moses O
thought O
that O
his O
people O
would O
understand O
that O
God O
was O
using O
him O
to O
save O
them O

But O
they O
did O
not O

`` O
The O
next O
day O

Moses O
saw O
two O
of O
his O
own O
people O
fighting O

He O
tried O
to O
make O
peace O
between O

The O
man O
who O
was O
hurting O
the O

pushed O

away O

said O
to O
him O

Egyptian O
yesterday O

When O
Moses O
heard O
him O
say O
this O

he O
left O
Egypt O

He O
went O
to O
live O
in O
the O
land O
of O
Midian O
, O
where O
he O
was O
a O
stranger O

During O

time O

Forty O

An O

him O

the O
flame O
of O

said O
to O
Aaron O
, O
' O
Moses O
led O
us O
out O
of O
the O
country O
of O
Egypt O
. O

But O
we O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
has O
happened O
to O
him O
. O

So O
make O
some O
gods O
to O
go O
before O
us O
and O
lead O
us O
. O
' O

So O
the O
people O
made O
an O
idol O
that O
looked O
like O
a O
calf O
. O

Then O
they O
brought O
sacrifices O
to O
it O
. O

They O
were O
very O
happy O
with O
what O
they O
had O
made O
with O
their O
own O
hands O
. O

But O
God O
turned O
against O
them O
and O
let O
them O
continue O
worshiping O
the O
army O
of O
false O
gods O
in O
the O
sky O
. O

This O
is O
what O
God O
says O
in O
the O
book O
that O
contains O
what O
the O
prophets O
wrote O
: O
' O
People O
of O
Israel O
, O
you O
did O
not O
bring O
me O
blood O
offerings O
and O
sacrifices O
in O
the O
desert O
for O
40 O
years O
; O
You O
carried O
with O
you O
the O
tent O
for O
worshiping O
Moloch O
and O
the O
image O
of O
the O
star O
of O
your O
god O
Rephan O
. O

These O
were O
the O
idols O
you O
made O
to O
worship O
. O

So O
I O
will O
send O
you O
away O
beyond O
Babylon O
. O
' O

`` O
The O
Holy O
Tent O
was O
with O
our O
ancestors O
in O
the O
desert O
. O

God O
told O
Moses O
how O
to O
make O
this O
tent O
. O

He O
made O
it O
like O
the O
plan O
that O
God O
showed O
him O
. O

Later O
, O
Joshua O
led O
our O
ancestors O
to O
capture O
the O
lands O
of O
the O
other O
nations O
. O

Our O
people O
went O
in O
and O
God O
made O
the O
other O
people O
go O
out O
. O

When O
our O
people O
went O
into O
this O
new O
land O
, O
they O
took O
with O
them O
this O
same O
tent O
. O

Our O
people O
received O
this O
tent O
from O
their O
fathers O
, O
and O
our O
people O
kept O
it O
until O
the O
time O
of O
David O
. O

God O
was O
very O
pleased O
with O
David O
. O

He O
asked O
God O
to O
let O
him O
build O
a O
Temple O
for O
the O
people O
of O
Jacob O
. O

But O
Solomon O
was O
the O
one O
who O
built O
the O
Temple O
. O

`` O
But O
the O
Most O
High O
God O
does O
not O
live O
in O
houses O
built O
by O
human O
hands O
. O

This O
is O
what O
the O
prophet O
writes O
: O
' O
The O
Lord O
says O
, O
Heaven O
is O
my O
throne O
, O
and O
the O
earth O
is O
where O
I O
rest O
my O
feet O
. O

So O
do O
you O
think O
you O
can O
build O
a O
house O
for O
me O
? O

Do O
I O
need O
a O
place O
to O
rest O
? O

Remember O
, O
I O
made O
all O
these O
things O
! O
' O
'' O

Then O
Stephen O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
stubborn O
Jewish O
leaders O
! O

You O
refuse O
to O
give O
your O
hearts O
to O
God O
or O
even O
listen O
to O
him O
. O

You O
are O
always O
against O
what O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
wants O
you O
to O
do O
. O

That O
's O
how O
your O
ancestors O
were O
, O
and O
you O
are O
just O
like O
them O
! O

They O
persecuted O
every O
prophet O
who O
ever O
lived O
. O

They O
even O
killed O
those O
who O
long O
ago O
said O
that O
the O
Righteous O
One O
would O
come O
. O

And O
now O
you O
have O
turned O
against O
that O
Righteous O
One O
and O
killed O
him O
. O

You O
are O
the O
people O
who O
received O
God O
's O
law O
, O
which O
he O
gave O
you O
through O
his O
angels O
. O

But O
you O
do O
n't O
obey O
it O
! O
'' O

When O
those O
in O
the O
council O
meeting O
heard O
this O
, O
they O
became O
very O
angry O
. O

They O
were O
so O
mad O
they O
were O
grinding O
their O
teeth O
at O
him O
. O

But O
Stephen O
was O
full O
of O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
. O

He O
looked O
up O
into O
heaven O
and O
saw O
the O
glory O
of O
God O
. O

And O
he O
saw O
Jesus O
standing O
at O
God O
's O
right O
side O
. O

Stephen O
said O
, O
`` O
Look O
! O

I O
see O
heaven O
open O
. O

And O
I O
see O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O
standing O
at O
God O
's O
right O
side O
. O
'' O

Everyone O
there O
started O
shouting O
loudly O
, O
covering O
their O
ears O
with O
their O
hands O
. O

Together O
they O
all O
ran O
at O
Stephen O
. O

They O
took O
him O
out O
of O
the O
city O
and O
began O
throwing O
stones O
at O
him O
. O

The O
men O
who O
told O
lies O
against O
Stephen O
gave O
their O
coats O
to O
a O
young O
man O
named O
Saul O
. O

As O
they O
were O
throwing O
the O
stones O
at O
him O
, O
Stephen O
was O
praying O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Lord O
Jesus O
, O
receive O
my O
spirit O
! O
'' O

He O
fell O
on O
his O
knees O
and O
shouted O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
do O
n't O
blame O
them O
for O
this O
sin O
! O
'' O

These O
were O
his O
last O
words O
before O
he O
died O
. O

Dear O
Theophilus O
, O
The O
first O
book O
I O
wrote O
was O
about O
everything O
Jesus O
did O
and O
taught O
from O
the O
beginning O
until O
the O
day O
he O
was O
carried O
up O
into O
heaven O
. O

Before O
he O
went O
, O
he O
talked O
to O
the O
apostles O
he O
had O
chosen O
. O

With O
the O
help O
of O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
, O
he O
told O
them O
what O
they O
should O
do O
. O

This O
was O
after O
his O
death O
, O
but O
he O
showed O
them O
that O
he O
was O
alive O
, O
proving O
it O
to O
them O
in O
many O
ways O
. O

The O
apostles O
saw O
Jesus O
many O
times O
during O
the O
40 O
days O
after O
he O
was O
raised O
from O
death O
. O

He O
spoke O
to O
them O
about O
God O
's O
kingdom O
. O

One O
time O
when O
Jesus O
was O
eating O
with O
them O
, O
he O
told O
them O
not O
to O
leave O
Jerusalem O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Wait O
here O
until O
you O
receive O
what O
the O
Father O
promised O
to O
send O
. O

Remember O
, O
I O
told O
you O
about O
it O
before O
. O

John O
baptized O
people O
with O
water O
, O
but O
in O
a O
few O
days O
you O
will O
be O
baptized O
with O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
. O
'' O

The O
apostles O
were O
all O
together O
. O

They O
asked O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
is O
this O
the O
time O
for O
you O
to O
give O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
their O
kingdom O
again O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
The O
Father O
is O
the O
only O
one O
who O
has O
the O
authority O
to O
decide O
dates O
and O
times O
. O

They O
are O
not O
for O
you O
to O
know O
. O

But O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
will O
come O
on O
you O
and O
give O
you O
power O
. O

You O
will O
be O
my O
witnesses O
. O

You O
will O
tell O
people O
everywhere O
about O
me O
-- O
in O
Jerusalem O
, O
in O
the O
rest O
of O
Judea O
, O
in O
Samaria O
, O
and O
in O
every O
part O
of O
the O
world O
. O
'' O

After O
Jesus O
said O
this O
, O
he O
was O
lifted O
up O
into O
the O
sky O
. O

While O
they O
were O
watching O
, O
he O
went O
into O
a O
cloud O
, O
and O
they O
could O
not O
see O
him O
. O

They O
were O
staring O
into O
the O
sky O
where O
he O
had O
gone O
. O

Suddenly O
two O
men O
wearing O
white O
clothes O
were O
standing O
beside O
them O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Men O
from O
Galilee O
, O
why O
are O
you O
standing O
here O
looking O
into O
the O
sky O
? O

You O
saw O
Jesus O
carried O
away O
from O
you O
into O
heaven O
. O

He O
will O
come O
back O
in O
the O
same O
way O
you O
saw O
him O
go O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
apostles O
went O
back O
to O
Jerusalem O
from O
the O
Mount O
of O
Olives O
. O

This O
mountain O
is O
about O
a O
half O
mile O
from O
Jerusalem O
. O

When O
they O
entered O
the O
city O
, O
they O
went O
to O
the O
upstairs O
room O
where O
they O
were O
staying O
. O

These O
are O
the O
ones O
who O
were O
there O
: O
Peter O
, O
John O
, O
James O
, O
Andrew O
, O
Philip O
, O
Thomas O
, O
Bartholomew O
, O
Matthew O
, O
James O

the O
son O
of O
Alphaeus O
-RRB- O
, O
Simon O
, O
the O
Zealot O
, O
and O
Judas O
-LRB- O
the O
son O
of O
James O
-RRB- O
. O

The O
apostles O
were O
all O
together O
. O

They O
were O
constantly O
praying O
with O
the O
same O
purpose O
. O

Some O
women O
, O
Mary O
the O
mother O
of O
Jesus O
, O
and O
his O
brothers O
were O
there O
with O
the O
apostles O
. O

After O
a O
few O
days O
there O
was O
a O
meeting O
of O
the O
believers O
. O

There O
were O
about O
120 O
of O
them O
. O

Peter O
stood O
up O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
in O
the O
Scriptures O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
said O
through O
David O
that O
something O
must O
happen O
. O

He O
was O
talking O
about O
Judas O
, O
one O
of O
our O
own O
group O
. O

Judas O
served O
together O
with O
us O
. O

The O
Spirit O
said O
that O
Judas O
would O
lead O
men O
to O
arrest O
Jesus O
. O
'' O

-LRB- O
Judas O
was O
paid O
money O
for O
doing O
this O
. O

His O
money O
was O
used O
to O
buy O
him O
a O
field O
. O

But O
he O
fell O
on O
his O
head O
, O
his O
body O
broke O
open O
, O
and O
all O
his O
intestines O
poured O
out O
. O

And O
all O
the O
people O
of O
Jerusalem O
learned O
about O
this O
. O

That O
is O
why O
they O
named O
that O
field O
Akeldama O
, O
which O
in O
their O
language O
means O
`` O
field O
of O
blood O
. O
'' O
-RRB- O

Peter O
said O
, O
`` O
In O
the O
book O
of O
Psalms O
, O
this O
is O
written O
about O
Judas O
: O
' O
People O
should O
not O
go O
near O
his O
land O
; O
no O
one O
should O
live O
there O
. O
' O

And O
it O
is O
also O
written O
: O
' O
Let O
another O
man O
have O
his O
work O
. O
' O

`` O
So O
now O
another O
man O
must O
join O
us O
and O
be O
a O
witness O
of O
Jesus O
' O
resurrection O

He O
must O
be O
one O
of O
those O
men O
who O
were O
part O
of O
our O
group O
during O
all O
the O
time O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
was O
with O
us O
. O

He O
must O
have O
been O
with O
us O
from O
the O
time O
John O
was O
baptizing O
people O
until O
the O
day O
when O
Jesus O
was O
carried O
up O
from O
us O
into O
heaven O
. O
'' O

They O
put O
two O
men O
before O
the O
group O
. O

One O
was O
Joseph O
Barsabbas O
. O

He O
was O
also O
called O
Justus O
. O

The O
other O
man O
was O
Matthias O
. O

They O
prayed O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
you O
know O
the O
minds O
of O
all O
people O
. O

Show O
us O
which O
one O
of O
these O
two O
men O
you O
choose O
to O
do O
this O
work O

Judas O
turned O
away O
from O
it O
and O
went O
where O
he O
belongs O
. O

Lord O
, O
show O
us O
which O
man O
should O
take O
his O
place O
as O
an O
apostle O
! O
'' O

Then O
they O
used O
lots O
to O
choose O
one O
of O
the O
two O
men O
. O

The O
lots O
showed O
that O
Matthias O
was O
the O
one O
the O
Lord O
wanted O
. O

So O
he O
became O
an O
apostle O
with O
the O
other O
eleven O
. O

While O
Peter O
and O
John O
were O
speaking O
to O
the O
people O
, O
some O
Jewish O
leaders O
came O
up O
to O
them O
. O

There O
were O
some O
priests O
, O
the O
captain O
of O
the O
soldiers O
that O
guarded O
the O
Temple O
, O
and O
some O
Sadducees O
. O

They O
were O
upset O
because O
of O
what O
Peter O
and O
John O
were O
teaching O
the O
people O
. O

By O
telling O
people O
about O
Jesus O
, O
the O
apostles O
were O
teaching O
that O
people O
will O
rise O
from O
death O
. O

The O
Jewish O
leaders O
arrested O
Peter O
and O
John O
and O
put O
them O
in O
jail O
. O

It O
was O
already O
night O
, O
so O
they O
kept O
them O
in O
jail O
until O
the O
next O
day O
. O

But O
many O
of O
the O
people O
who O
heard O
the O
apostles O
believed O
what O
they O
said O
. O

There O
were O
now O
about O
5000 O
men O
in O
the O
group O
of O
believers O
. O

The O
next O
day O
the O
Jewish O
rulers O
, O
the O
older O
Jewish O
leaders O
, O
and O
the O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
met O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

Annas O
the O
high O
priest O
, O
Caiaphas O
, O
John O
, O
and O
Alexander O
were O
there O
. O

Everyone O
from O
the O
high O
priest O
's O
family O
was O
there O
. O

They O
made O
Peter O
and O
John O
stand O
before O
all O
the O
people O
. O

They O
asked O
them O
over O
and O
over O
, O
`` O
How O
did O
you O
make O
this O
crippled O
man O
well O

What O
power O
did O
you O
use O
? O

By O
whose O
authority O
did O
you O
do O
this O
? O
'' O

Then O
Peter O
was O
filled O
with O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
and O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Rulers O
of O
the O
people O

you O
older O
leaders O

are O
you O
questioning O
us O
today O
about O
what O
we O
did O
to O
help O
this O
crippled O
man O

Are O
you O
asking O
us O
what O
made O
him O
well O

We O
want O
all O
of O
you O

all O
the O
people O
of O

know O
that O
this O
man O
was O
made O
well O
by O
the O
power O
of O
Jesus O
Christ O
from O
Nazareth O

You O
nailed O
Jesus O
to O
a O
cross O
, O
but O
God O
raised O
him O
from O
death O

This O
man O
was O
crippled O
, O
but O
he O
is O
now O
well O
. O

He O
is O
able O
to O
stand O
here O
before O
you O

of O
the O
power O
of O
Jesus O

Jesus O
is O

the O
stone O
that O
you O
builders O
thought O
was O
not O
important O

But O
this O
stone O
has O
become O
the O
cornerstone O

' O

Jesus O
is O
the O
only O
one O
who O
can O
save O
people O

His O
name O
is O
the O
only O
power O
in O
the O
world O
that O
has O
been O
given O
to O
save O
anyone O

We O
must O
be O
saved O
through O
him O

'' O

The O
Jewish O
leaders O
understood O
that O
Peter O
and O
John O
had O
no O
special O
training O
or O
education O
. O

But O
they O
also O
saw O
that O
they O
were O
not O
afraid O
to O
speak O
. O

So O
the O
leaders O
were O
amazed O
. O

They O
also O
realized O
that O
Peter O
and O
John O
had O
been O
with O
Jesus O
. O

They O
saw O
the O
crippled O
man O
standing O
there O
beside O
the O
apostles O
. O

They O
saw O
that O
he O
was O
healed O
, O
so O
they O
could O
say O
nothing O
against O
the O
apostles O
. O

The O
Jewish O
leaders O
told O
them O
to O
leave O
the O
council O
meeting O
. O

Then O
the O
leaders O
talked O
to O
each O
other O
about O
what O
they O
should O
do O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
What O
shall O
we O
do O
with O
these O
men O

in O
Jerusalem O
knows O
about O
the O
miracle O
they O
did O
as O
a O
sign O
from O
God O
. O

It O
's O
too O
obvious O
. O

We O
ca O
n't O
say O
it O
did O
n't O
happen O
. O

But O
we O
must O
make O
them O
afraid O
to O
talk O
to O
anyone O
again O
about O
that O
man O
. O

Then O
this O
problem O
will O
not O
spread O
among O
the O
people O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
Jewish O
leaders O
called O
Peter O
and O
John O
in O
again O
. O

They O
told O
the O
apostles O
not O
to O
say O
anything O
or O
to O
teach O
anything O
in O
the O
name O
of O
Jesus O
. O

But O
Peter O
and O
John O
answered O
them O
, O
`` O
What O
do O
you O
think O
is O
right O
? O

What O
would O
God O
want O
? O

Should O
we O
obey O
you O
or O
God O
? O

We O
can O
not O
be O
quiet O
. O

We O
must O
tell O
people O
about O
what O
we O
have O
seen O
and O
heard O
. O
'' O

The O
Jewish O
leaders O
could O
not O
find O
a O
way O
to O
punish O
the O
apostles O
, O
because O
all O
the O
people O
were O
praising O
God O
for O
what O
had O
been O
done O
. O

This O
miracle O
was O
a O
sign O
from O
God O
. O

The O
man O
who O
was O
healed O
was O
more O
than O
40 O
years O
old O
. O

So O
the O
Jewish O
leaders O
warned O
the O
apostles O
again O
and O
let O
them O
go O
free O
. O

Peter O
and O
John O
left O
the O
meeting O
of O
Jewish O
leaders O
and O
went O
to O
their O
own O
group O
. O

They O
told O
the O
group O
everything O
that O
the O
leading O
priests O
and O
the O
older O
Jewish O
leaders O
had O
said O
to O
them O
. O

When O
the O
believers O
heard O
this O
, O
they O
all O
prayed O
to O
God O
with O
one O
purpose O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Master O
, O
you O
are O
the O
one O
who O
made O
the O
sky O
, O
the O
earth O
, O
the O
sea O
, O
and O
everything O
in O
the O
world O
. O

Our O
ancestor O
David O
was O
your O
servant O
. O

With O
the O
help O
of O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
he O
wrote O
these O
words O
: O
' O
Why O
are O
the O
nations O
shouting O
? O

Why O
are O
the O
people O
planning O
such O
useless O
things O
? O

The O
kings O
of O
the O
earth O
prepare O
themselves O
to O
fight O
, O
and O
the O
rulers O
all O
come O
together O
against O
the O
Lord O
and O
against O
his O
Christ O
. O
' O

That O
's O
what O
actually O
happened O
when O
Herod O
, O
Pontius O
Pilate O
, O
the O
other O
nations O
, O
and O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
all O
came O
together O
against O
Jesus O
here O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

He O
is O
your O
holy O
Servant O
, O
the O
one O
you O
made O
to O
be O
the O
Christ O
. O

These O
people O
who O
came O
together O
against O
Jesus O
made O
your O
plan O
happen O
. O

It O
was O
done O
because O
of O
your O
power O
and O
your O
will O
. O

And O
now O
, O
Lord O
, O
listen O
to O
what O
they O
are O
saying O
. O

They O
are O
trying O
to O
make O
us O
afraid O
. O

We O
are O
your O
servants O
. O

Help O
us O
to O
say O
what O
you O
want O
us O
to O
say O
without O
fear O
. O

Help O
us O
to O
be O
brave O
by O
showing O
us O
your O
power O
. O

Make O
sick O
people O
well O
. O

Cause O
miraculous O
signs O
and O
wonders O
to O
happen O
by O
the O
authority O
of O
Jesus O
, O
your O
holy O
servant O
. O
'' O

After O
the O
believers O
prayed O
, O
the O
place O
where O
they O
were O
meeting O
shook O
. O

They O
were O
all O
filled O
with O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
, O
and O
they O
continued O
to O
speak O
God O
's O
message O
without O
fear O
. O

The O
whole O
group O
of O
believers O
was O
united O
in O
their O
thinking O
and O
in O
what O
they O
wanted O
. O

None O
of O
them O
said O
that O
the O
things O
they O
had O
were O
their O
own O
. O

Instead O
, O
they O
shared O
everything O
. O

With O
great O
power O
the O
apostles O
were O
making O
it O
known O
to O
everyone O
that O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
was O
raised O
from O
death O
. O

And O
God O
blessed O
all O
the O
believers O
very O
much O
. O

None O
of O
them O
could O
say O
they O
needed O
anything O
. O

Everyone O
who O
owned O
fields O
or O
houses O
sold O
them O
. O

They O
brought O
the O
money O
they O
got O
and O
gave O
it O
to O
the O
apostles O
. O

Then O
everyone O
was O
given O
whatever O
they O
needed O
. O

One O
of O
the O
believers O
was O
named O
Joseph O
. O

The O
apostles O
called O
him O
Barnabas O
, O
a O
name O
that O
means O
`` O
one O
who O
encourages O
others O
. O
'' O

He O
was O
a O
Levite O
born O
in O
Cyprus O
. O

Joseph O
sold O
a O
field O
he O
owned O
. O

He O
brought O
the O
money O
and O
gave O
it O
to O
the O
apostles O
. O

After O
we O
said O
goodbye O
to O
the O
elders O
, O
we O
sailed O
away O
straight O
to O
Cos O
island O
. O

The O
next O
day O
we O
went O
to O
the O
island O
of O
Rhodes O
, O
and O
from O
there O
we O
went O
to O
Patara O
. O

There O
we O
found O
a O
ship O
that O
was O
going O
to O
the O
area O
of O
Phoenicia O
. O

We O
got O
on O
the O
ship O
and O
sailed O
away O
. O

We O
sailed O
near O
the O
island O
of O
Cyprus O
. O

We O
could O
see O
it O
on O
the O
north O
side O
, O
but O
we O
did O
not O
stop O
. O

We O
sailed O
to O
the O
country O
of O
Syria O
. O

We O
stopped O
at O
Tyre O
because O
the O
ship O
needed O
to O
unload O
its O
cargo O
there O
. O

We O
found O
the O
Lord O
's O
followers O
there O
and O
stayed O
with O
them O
for O
seven O
days O
. O

They O
warned O
Paul O
not O
to O
go O
to O
Jerusalem O
because O
of O
what O
the O
Spirit O
had O
told O
them O
. O

But O
when O
our O
time O
there O
was O
up O
, O
we O
returned O
to O
the O
ship O
to O
continue O
our O
trip O
. O

All O
the O
followers O
, O
even O
the O
women O
and O
children O
, O
came O
with O
us O
to O
the O
seashore O
. O

We O
all O
knelt O
down O
on O
the O
beach O
, O
prayed O
, O
and O
said O
goodbye O
. O

Then O
we O
got O
on O
the O
ship O
, O
and O
the O
followers O
went O
home O
. O

We O
continued O
our O
trip O
from O
Tyre O
and O
went O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Ptolemais O
. O

We O
greeted O
our O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
in O
God O
's O
family O
there O
and O
stayed O
with O
them O
one O
day O
. O

The O
next O
day O
we O
left O
Ptolemais O
and O
went O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Caesarea O
. O

We O
went O
into O
the O
home O
of O
Philip O
and O
stayed O
with O
him O
. O

He O
had O
the O
work O
of O
telling O
the O
Good O
News O
. O

He O
was O
one O
of O
the O
seven O
helpers O
. O

He O
had O
four O
unmarried O
daughters O
who O
had O
the O
gift O
of O
prophesying O
. O

After O
we O
had O
been O
there O
for O
several O
days O
, O
a O
prophet O
named O
Agabus O
came O
from O
Judea O
. O

He O
came O
to O
us O
and O
borrowed O
Paul O
's O
belt O
. O

He O
used O
it O
to O
tie O
his O
own O
hands O
and O
feet O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
Holy O
Spirit O
tells O
me O
, O
' O
This O
is O
how O
the O
Jews O
in O
Jerusalem O
will O
tie O
up O
the O
man O
who O
wears O
this O
belt O
. O

Then O
they O
will O
hand O
him O
over O
to O
people O
who O
do O
n't O
know O
God O
. O
' O
'' O

When O
we O
heard O
this O
, O
we O
and O
the O
other O
followers O
there O
begged O
Paul O
not O
to O
go O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

But O
he O
said O
, O
`` O
Why O
are O
you O
crying O
and O
making O
me O
feel O
so O
sad O
? O

I O
am O
willing O
to O
be O
put O
in O
jail O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

I O
am O
even O
ready O
to O
die O
for O
the O
name O
of O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
! O
'' O

We O
could O
not O
persuade O
him O
to O
stay O
away O
from O
Jerusalem O
. O

So O
we O
stopped O
begging O
him O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
We O
pray O
that O
what O
the O
Lord O
wants O
will O
be O
done O
. O
'' O

After O
this O
, O
we O
got O
ready O
and O
left O
for O
Jerusalem O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
followers O
of O
Jesus O
from O
Caesarea O
went O
with O
us O
. O

These O
followers O
took O
us O
to O
the O
home O
of O
Mnason O
, O
a O
man O
from O
Cyprus O
, O
who O
was O
one O
of O
the O
first O
people O
to O
be O
a O
follower O
of O
Jesus O
. O

They O
took O
us O
to O
his O
home O
so O
that O
we O
could O
stay O
with O
him O
. O

The O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
in O
Jerusalem O
were O
very O
happy O
to O
see O
us O
. O

The O
next O
day O
Paul O
went O
with O
us O
to O
visit O
James O
, O
and O
all O
the O
elders O
were O
there O
. O

After O
greeting O
them O
, O
Paul O
told O
them O
point O
by O
point O
all O
that O
God O
had O
used O
him O
to O
do O
among O
the O
non-Jewish O
people O
. O

When O
the O
leaders O
heard O
this O
, O
they O
praised O
God O
. O

Then O
they O
said O
to O
Paul O
, O
`` O
Brother O
, O
you O
can O
see O
that O
thousands O
of O
Jews O
have O
become O
believers O
, O
but O
they O
think O
it O
is O
very O
important O
to O
obey O
the O
Law O
of O
Moses O
. O

They O
have O
been O
told O
that O
you O
teach O
the O
Jews O
who O
live O
in O
non-Jewish O
regions O
to O
stop O
following O
the O
Law O
of O
Moses O
. O

They O
have O
heard O
that O
you O
tell O
them O
not O
to O
circumcise O
their O
sons O
or O
follow O
our O
other O
customs O
. O

`` O
What O
should O
we O
do O
? O

The O
Jewish O
believers O
here O
will O
learn O
that O
you O
have O
come O
. O

So O
we O
will O
tell O
you O
what O
to O
do O
: O
Four O
of O
our O
men O
have O
made O
a O
vow O
to O
God O
. O

Take O
these O
men O
with O
you O
and O
share O
in O
their O
cleansing O
ceremony O
. O

Pay O
their O
expenses O
so O
that O
they O
can O
shave O
their O
heads O
. O

This O
will O
prove O
to O
everyone O
that O
the O
things O
they O
have O
heard O
about O
you O
are O
not O
true O
. O

They O
will O
see O
that O
you O
obey O
the O
Law O
of O
Moses O
in O
your O
own O
life O
. O

`` O
In O
regard O
to O
the O
non-Jewish O
believers O
, O
we O
have O
already O
sent O
a O
letter O
to O
them O
saying O
what O
we O
think O
they O
should O
do O
: O
' O
Do O
n't O
eat O
food O
that O
has O
been O
given O
to O
idols O
. O

Do O
n't O
eat O
meat O
from O
animals O
that O
have O
been O
strangled O
or O
any O
meat O
that O
still O
has O
the O
blood O
in O
it O
. O

Do O
n't O
be O
involved O
in O
sexual O
sin O
. O
' O
'' O

So O
Paul O
took O
the O
four O
men O
with O
him O
. O

The O
next O
day O
he O
shared O
in O
their O
cleansing O
ceremony O
. O

Then O
he O
went O
to O
the O
Temple O
area O
and O
announced O
the O
time O
when O
the O
days O
of O
the O
cleansing O
ceremony O
would O
be O
finished O
. O

On O
the O
last O
day O
an O
offering O
would O
be O
given O
for O
each O
of O
the O
men O
. O

When O
the O
seven-day O
period O
was O
almost O
finished O
, O
some O
Jews O
from O
Asia O
saw O
Paul O
in O
the O
Temple O
area O
. O

They O
stirred O
up O
everyone O
into O
an O
angry O
mob O
. O

They O
grabbed O
Paul O
and O
shouted O
, O
`` O
Men O
of O
Israel O
, O
help O
us O
! O

This O
is O
the O
man O
who O
is O
teaching O
things O
that O
are O
against O
the O
Law O
of O
Moses O
, O
against O
our O
people O
, O
and O
against O
this O
Temple O
of O
ours O
. O

This O
is O
what O
he O
teaches O
people O
everywhere O
. O

And O
now O
he O
has O
brought O
some O
Greeks O
into O
the O
Temple O
area O
and O
has O
made O
this O
holy O
place O
unclean O
! O
'' O

-LRB- O
The O
Jews O
said O
this O
because O
they O
had O
seen O
Trophimus O
with O
Paul O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

Trophimus O
was O
a O
man O
from O
Ephesus O
. O

The O
Jews O
thought O
that O
Paul O
had O
taken O
him O
into O
the O
holy O
area O
of O
the O
Temple O
. O
-RRB- O

An O
angry O
reaction O
spread O
throughout O
the O
city O
, O
and O
everyone O
came O
running O
to O
the O
Temple O
. O

They O
grabbed O
Paul O
and O
dragged O
him O
out O
of O
the O
holy O
area O
, O
and O
the O
gates O
were O
closed O
immediately O
. O

While O
they O
were O
trying O
to O
kill O
Paul O
, O
the O
commander O
of O
the O
Roman O
army O
in O
Jerusalem O
got O
word O
that O
the O
whole O
city O
was O
in O
a O
state O
of O
riot O
. O

Immediately O
the O
commander O
ran O
to O
where O
the O
crowd O
had O
gathered O
, O
taking O
with O
him O
some O
army O
officers O
and O
soldiers O
. O

When O
the O
people O
saw O
the O
commander O
and O
his O
soldiers O
, O
they O
stopped O
beating O
Paul O
. O

The O
commander O
went O
over O
to O
Paul O
and O
arrested O
him O
. O

He O
told O
his O
soldiers O
to O
tie O
him O
up O
with O
two O
chains O
. O

Then O
he O
asked O
, O
`` O
Who O
is O
this O
man O
? O

What O
has O
he O
done O
wrong O
? O
'' O

Some O
people O
there O
were O
shouting O
one O
thing O
, O
and O
others O
were O
shouting O
something O
else O
. O

Because O
of O
all O
this O
confusion O
and O
shouting O
, O
the O
commander O
could O
not O
learn O
the O
truth O
about O
what O
had O
happened O
. O

So O
he O
told O
the O
soldiers O
to O
take O
Paul O
to O
the O
army O
building O
. O

The O
whole O
crowd O
was O
following O
them O
. O

When O
the O
soldiers O
came O
to O
the O
steps O
, O
they O
had O
to O
carry O
Paul O
. O

They O
did O
this O
to O
protect O
him O
, O
because O
the O
people O
were O
ready O
to O
hurt O
him O
. O

The O
people O
were O
shouting O
, O
`` O
Kill O
him O
! O
'' O

When O
the O
soldiers O
were O
ready O
to O
take O
Paul O
into O
the O
army O
building O
, O
he O
asked O
the O
commander O
, O
`` O
Can O
I O
say O
something O
to O
you O
? O
'' O

The O
commander O
said O
, O
`` O
Oh O
, O
you O
speak O
Greek O
? O

Then O
you O
are O
not O
the O
man O
I O
thought O
you O
were O
. O

I O
thought O
you O
were O
the O
Egyptian O
who O
started O
some O
trouble O
against O
the O
government O
not O
long O
ago O
and O
led O
four O
thousand O
terrorists O
out O
to O
the O
desert O
. O
'' O

Paul O
said O
, O
`` O
No O
, O
I O
am O
a O
Jew O
from O
Tarsus O
in O
the O
country O
of O
Cilicia O
. O

I O
am O
a O
citizen O
of O
that O
important O
city O
. O

Please O
, O
let O
me O
speak O
to O
the O
people O
. O
'' O

The O
commander O
told O
Paul O
he O
could O
speak O
. O

So O
he O
stood O
on O
the O
steps O
and O
waved O
his O
hand O
so O
that O
the O
people O
would O
be O
quiet O
. O

The O
people O
became O
quiet O
and O
Paul O
spoke O
to O
them O
in O
Aramaic O
. O

Paul O
looked O
at O
the O
council O
members O
and O
said O
, O
`` O

Brothers O
, O
I O
have O
lived O
my O
life O
in O
a O
good O
way O
before O
God O
. O

I O
have O
always O
done O
what O
I O
thought O
was O
right O
. O
'' O

Ananias O
, O
the O
high O
priest O
, O
was O
there O
. O

When O
he O
heard O
this O
, O
he O
told O
the O
men O
who O
were O
standing O
near O
Paul O
to O
hit O
him O
in O
the O
mouth O
. O

Paul O
said O
to O
Ananias O
, O
`` O
God O
will O
hit O
you O
too O
! O

You O
are O
like O
a O
dirty O
wall O
that O
has O
been O
painted O
white O
. O

You O
sit O
there O
and O
judge O
me O
, O
using O
the O
Law O
of O
Moses O
. O

But O
you O
are O
telling O
them O
to O
hit O
me O
, O
and O
that O
is O
against O
the O
law O
. O
'' O

The O
men O
standing O
near O
Paul O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Are O
you O
sure O
you O
want O
to O
insult O
God O
's O
high O
priest O
like O
that O
? O
'' O

Paul O
said O
, O
`` O
Brothers O
, O
I O
did O
not O
know O
this O
man O
was O
the O
high O
priest O
. O

The O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
' O
You O
must O
not O
say O
bad O
things O
about O
a O
leader O
of O
your O
people O
. O
' O
'' O

Paul O
knew O
that O
some O
of O
the O
men O
in O
the O
council O
meeting O
were O
Sadducees O
and O
some O
were O
Pharisees O
. O

So O
he O
shouted O
, O
`` O
My O
brothers O
, O
I O
am O
a O
Pharisee O
and O
my O
father O
was O
a O
Pharisee O
! O

I O
am O
on O
trial O
here O
because O
I O
believe O
that O
people O
will O
rise O
from O
death O
. O
'' O

When O
Paul O
said O
this O
, O
a O
big O
argument O
started O
between O
the O
Pharisees O
and O
the O
Sadducees O
. O

The O
group O
was O
divided O
. O

-LRB- O
The O
Sadducees O
believe O
that O
after O
people O
die O
, O
they O
will O
not O
live O
again O
as O
an O
angel O
or O
as O
a O
spirit O
. O

But O
the O
Pharisees O
believe O
in O
both O
. O
-RRB- O

All O
these O
Jews O
began O
shouting O
louder O
and O
louder O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
, O
who O
were O
Pharisees O
, O
stood O
up O
and O
argued O
, O
`` O
We O
find O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
this O
man O
. O

Maybe O
an O
angel O
or O
a O
spirit O
really O
did O
speak O
to O
him O
. O
'' O

The O
argument O
turned O
into O
a O
fight O
, O
and O
the O
commander O
was O
afraid O
that O
the O
Jews O
would O
tear O
Paul O
to O
pieces O
. O

So O
he O
told O
the O
soldiers O
to O
go O
down O
and O
take O
Paul O
away O
from O
these O
Jews O
and O
put O
him O
in O
the O
army O
building O
. O

The O
next O
night O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
came O
and O
stood O
by O
Paul O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Be O
brave O
! O

You O
have O
told O
people O
in O
Jerusalem O
about O
me O
. O

You O
must O
do O
the O
same O
in O
Rome O
. O
'' O

The O
next O
morning O
some O
of O
the O
Jews O
made O
a O
plan O
to O
kill O
Paul O
. O

They O
made O
a O
promise O
to O
themselves O
that O
they O
would O
not O
eat O
or O
drink O
anything O
until O
they O
had O
killed O
him O
. O

There O
were O
more O
than O
40 O
of O
them O
who O
made O
this O
plan O
. O

They O
went O
and O
talked O
to O
the O
leading O
priests O
and O
the O
older O
Jewish O
leaders O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
We O
have O
promised O
ourselves O
that O
we O
will O
not O
eat O
or O
drink O
until O
we O
have O
killed O
Paul O
. O

So O
this O
is O
what O
we O
want O
you O
to O
do O
: O
Send O
a O
message O
to O
the O
commander O
from O
you O
and O
the O
high O
council O
. O

Tell O
him O
you O
want O
him O
to O
bring O
Paul O
out O
to O
you O
. O

Say O
that O
you O
want O
to O
ask O
him O
more O
questions O
. O

We O
will O
be O
waiting O
to O
kill O
him O
while O
he O
is O
on O
the O
way O
here O
. O
'' O

But O
Paul O
's O
nephew O
heard O
about O
this O
plan O
. O

He O
went O
to O
the O
army O
building O
and O
told O
Paul O
. O

Then O
Paul O
called O
one O
of O
the O
army O
officers O
and O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Take O
this O
young O
man O
to O
the O
commander O
. O

He O
has O
a O
message O
for O
him O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
army O
officer O
brought O
Paul O
's O
nephew O
to O
the O
commander O
. O

The O
officer O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
prisoner O
Paul O
asked O
me O
to O
bring O
this O
young O
man O
to O
you O
. O

He O
has O
something O
to O
tell O
you O
. O
'' O

The O
commander O
led O
the O
young O
man O
to O
a O
place O
where O
they O
could O
be O
alone O
. O

The O
commander O
asked O
, O
`` O
What O
do O
you O
want O
to O
tell O
me O
? O
'' O

The O
young O
man O
said O
, O
`` O
Some O
Jews O
have O
decided O
to O
ask O
you O
to O
bring O
Paul O
down O
to O
their O
council O
meeting O
tomorrow O
. O

They O
want O
you O
to O
think O
that O
they O
plan O
to O
ask O
Paul O
more O
questions O
. O

But O
do O
n't O
believe O
them O
! O

More O
than O
40 O
of O
them O
are O
hiding O
and O
waiting O
to O
kill O
him O
. O

They O
have O
all O
promised O
not O
to O
eat O
or O
drink O
until O
they O
have O
killed O
him O
. O

Now O
they O
are O
waiting O
for O
you O
to O
say O
yes O
. O
'' O

The O
commander O
sent O
the O
young O
man O
away O
, O
telling O
him O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
tell O
anyone O
that O
you O
have O
told O
me O
about O
their O
plan O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
commander O
called O
two O
army O
officers O
. O

He O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
I O
need O
some O
men O
to O
go O
to O
Caesarea O
. O

Get O
200 O
soldiers O
ready O
. O

Also O
, O
get O
70 O
soldiers O
on O
horses O
and O
200 O
men O
to O
carry O
spears O
. O

Be O
ready O
to O
leave O
at O
nine O
o'clock O
tonight O
. O

Get O
some O
horses O
for O
Paul O
to O
ride O
so O
that O
he O
can O
be O
taken O
to O
Governor O
Felix O
safely O
. O
'' O

The O
commander O
wrote O
a O
letter O
that O
said O
: O
> O
From O
Claudius O
Lysias O
. O

To O
the O
Most O
Honorable O
Governor O
Felix O
. O

Greetings O
: O
Some O
Jews O
had O
taken O
this O
man O
and O
planned O
to O
kill O
him O
. O

But O
I O
learned O
that O
he O
is O
a O
Roman O
citizen O
, O
so O
I O
went O
with O
my O
soldiers O
and O
saved O
him O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
know O
why O
they O
were O
accusing O
him O
. O

So O
I O
brought O
him O
before O
their O
council O
meeting O
. O

This O
is O
what O
I O
learned O
: O
The O
Jews O
said O
this O
man O
did O
some O
things O
that O
were O
wrong O
. O

But O
these O
charges O
were O
about O
their O
own O
Jewish O
laws O
, O
and O
there O
was O
nothing O
worthy O
of O
jail O
or O
death O
. O

I O
was O
told O
that O
some O
of O
the O
Jews O
were O
making O
a O
plan O
to O
kill O
him O
. O

So O
I O
decided O
to O
send O
him O
to O
you O
. O

I O
also O
told O
those O
Jews O
to O
tell O
you O
what O
they O
have O
against O
him O
. O

The O
soldiers O
did O
what O
they O
were O
told O
. O

They O
got O
Paul O
and O
took O
him O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Antipatris O
that O
night O
. O

The O
next O
day O
the O
soldiers O
on O
horses O
went O
with O
Paul O
to O
Caesarea O
, O
but O
the O
other O
soldiers O
and O
the O
spearmen O
went O
back O
to O
the O
army O
building O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

The O
soldiers O
on O
horses O
entered O
Caesarea O
, O
gave O
the O
letter O
to O
Governor O
Felix O
, O
and O
then O
turned O
Paul O
over O
to O
him O
. O

The O
governor O
read O
the O
letter O
and O
asked O
Paul O
, O
`` O
What O
country O
are O
you O
from O
? O
'' O

The O
governor O
learned O
that O
Paul O
was O
from O
Cilicia O
. O

The O
governor O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
will O
hear O
your O
case O
when O
the O
Jews O
who O
are O
accusing O
you O
come O
here O
too O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
governor O
gave O
orders O
for O
Paul O
to O
be O
kept O
in O
the O
palace O
built O
by O
Herod O
. O

Then O
some O
men O
came O
to O
Antioch O
from O
Judea O
and O
began O
teaching O
the O
non-Jewish O
believers O
: O
`` O
You O
can O
not O
be O
saved O
if O
you O
are O
not O
circumcised O
as O
Moses O
taught O
us O
. O
'' O

Paul O
and O
Barnabas O
were O
against O
this O
teaching O
and O
argued O
with O
these O
men O
about O
it O
. O

So O
the O
group O
decided O
to O
send O
Paul O
, O
Barnabas O
, O
and O
some O
others O
to O
Jerusalem O
to O
talk O
more O
about O
this O
with O
the O
apostles O
and O
elders O
. O

The O
church O
helped O
them O
get O
ready O
to O
leave O
on O
their O
trip O
. O

The O
men O
went O
through O
the O
countries O
of O
Phoenicia O
and O
Samaria O
, O
where O
they O
told O
all O
about O
how O
the O
non-Jewish O
people O
had O
turned O
to O
the O
true O
God O
. O

This O
made O
all O
the O
believers O
very O
happy O
. O

When O
the O
men O
arrived O
in O
Jerusalem O
, O
the O
apostles O
, O
the O
elders O
, O
and O
the O
whole O
church O
welcomed O
them O
. O

Paul O
, O
Barnabas O
, O
and O
the O
others O
told O
about O
all O
that O
God O
had O
done O
with O
them O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
believers O
in O
Jerusalem O
had O
belonged O
to O
the O
Pharisees O
. O

They O
stood O
up O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
non-Jewish O
believers O
must O
be O
circumcised O
. O

We O
must O
tell O
them O
to O
obey O
the O
Law O
of O
Moses O
! O
'' O

Then O
the O
apostles O
and O
the O
elders O
gathered O
to O
study O
this O
problem O
. O

After O
a O
long O
debate O
, O
Peter O
stood O
up O
and O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
My O
brothers O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
you O
remember O
what O
happened O
in O
the O
early O
days O
. O

God O
chose O
me O
from O
among O
you O
to O
tell O
the O
Good O
News O
to O
those O
who O
are O
not O
Jewish O
. O

It O
was O
from O
me O
that O
they O
heard O
the O
Good O
News O
and O
believed O
. O

God O
knows O
everyone O
, O
even O
their O
thoughts O
, O
and O
he O
accepted O
these O
non-Jewish O
people O
. O

He O
showed O
this O
to O
us O
by O
giving O
them O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
the O
same O
as O
he O
did O
to O
us O
. O

To O
God O
, O
those O
people O
are O
not O
different O
from O
us O
. O

When O
they O
believed O
, O
God O
made O
their O
hearts O
pure O
. O

So O
now O
, O
why O
are O
you O
putting O
a O
heavy O
burden O
around O
the O
necks O
of O
the O
non-Jewish O
followers O
? O

Are O
you O
trying O
to O
make O
God O
angry O
? O

We O
and O
our O
fathers O
were O
not O
able O
to O
carry O
that O
burden O
. O

No O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
we O
and O
these O
people O
will O
be O
saved O
the O
same O
way O
-- O
by O
the O
grace O
of O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
whole O
group O
became O
quiet O
. O

They O
listened O
while O
Paul O
and O
Barnabas O
told O
about O
all O
the O
miraculous O
signs O
and O
wonders O
that O
God O
had O
done O
through O
them O
among O
the O
non-Jewish O
people O
. O

When O
they O
finished O
speaking O
, O
James O
said O
, O
`` O
My O
brothers O
, O
listen O
to O
me O
. O

Simon O
Peter O
has O
told O
us O
how O
God O
showed O
his O
love O
for O
the O
non-Jewish O
people O
. O

For O
the O
first O
time O
God O
accepted O
them O
and O
made O
them O
his O
people O
. O

The O
words O
of O
the O
prophets O
agree O
with O
this O
too O
: O
' O
I O
will O
return O
after O
this O
. O

I O
will O
build O
David O
's O
house O
again O
. O

It O
has O
fallen O
down O
. O

I O
will O
build O
again O
the O
parts O
of O
his O
house O
that O
have O
been O
pulled O
down O
. O

I O
will O
make O
his O
house O
new O
. O

Then O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
will O
look O
for O
the O
Lord O
God O
-- O
all O
those O
of O
other O
nations O
who O
are O
my O
people O
too O
. O

The O
Lord O
said O
this O
. O

And O
he O
is O
the O
one O
who O
does O
all O
these O
things O
. O
' O

' O
All O
this O
has O
been O
known O
from O
the O
beginning O
of O
time O
. O
' O

`` O
So O
I O
think O
we O
should O
not O
make O
things O
hard O
for O
those O
who O
have O
turned O
to O
God O
from O
among O
the O
non-Jewish O
people O
. O

Instead O
, O
we O
should O
send O
a O
letter O
telling O
them O
only O
the O
things O
they O
should O
not O
do O
: O
Do O
n't O
eat O
food O
that O
has O
been O
given O
to O
idols O
. O

This O
makes O
the O
food O
unclean O
. O

Do O
n't O
be O
involved O
in O
sexual O
sin O
. O

Do O
n't O
eat O
meat O
from O
animals O
that O
have O
been O
strangled O
or O
any O
meat O
that O
still O
has O
the O
blood O
in O
it O
. O

They O
should O
not O
do O
any O
of O
these O
things O
, O
because O
there O
are O
still O
men O
in O
every O
city O
who O
teach O
the O
Law O
of O
Moses O
. O

The O
words O
of O
Moses O
have O
been O
read O
in O
the O
synagogue O
every O
Sabbath O
day O
for O
many O
years O
. O
'' O

The O
apostles O
, O
the O
elders O
, O
and O
the O
whole O
church O
wanted O
to O
send O
some O
men O
with O
Paul O
and O
Barnabas O
to O
Antioch O
. O

The O
group O
decided O
to O
choose O
some O
of O
their O
own O
men O
. O

They O
chose O
Judas O
-LRB- O
also O
called O
Barsabbas O
-RRB- O
and O
Silas O
, O
men O
who O
were O
respected O
by O
the O
believers O
. O

The O
group O
sent O
the O
letter O
with O
these O
men O
. O

The O
letter O
said O
: O
> O
From O
the O
apostles O
and O
elders O
, O
your O
brothers O

To O
all O
the O
non-Jewish O
brothers O
in O
the O
city O
of O
Antioch O
and O
in O
the O
countries O
of O
Syria O
and O
Cilicia O

Dear O
Brothers O
: O
We O
have O
heard O
that O
some O
men O
have O
come O
to O
you O
from O
our O
group O
. O

What O
they O
said O
troubled O
and O
upset O
you O
. O

But O
we O
did O
not O
tell O
them O
to O
do O
this O
. O

We O
have O
all O
agreed O
to O
choose O
some O
men O
and O
send O
them O
to O
you O
. O

They O
will O
be O
with O
our O
dear O
friends O
, O
Barnabas O
and O
Paul O
. O

Barnabas O
and O
Paul O
have O
given O
their O
lives O
to O
serve O
our O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

So O
we O
have O
sent O
Judas O
and O
Silas O
with O
them O
. O

They O
will O
tell O
you O
the O
same O
things O
. O

We O
agree O
with O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
that O
you O
should O
have O
no O
more O
burdens O
, O
except O
for O
these O
necessary O
things O
: O
Do O
n't O
eat O
food O
that O
has O
been O
given O
to O
idols O
. O

Do O
n't O
eat O
meat O
from O
animals O
that O
have O
been O
strangled O
or O
any O
meat O
that O
still O
has O
the O
blood O
in O
it O
. O

Do O
n't O
be O
involved O
in O
sexual O
sin O
. O

If O
you O
stay O
away O
from O
these O
, O
you O
will O
do O
well O
. O

We O
say O
goodbye O
now O
. O

So O
Paul O
, O
Barnabas O
, O
Judas O
, O
and O
Silas O
left O
Jerusalem O
and O
went O
to O
Antioch O
. O

There O
they O
gathered O
the O
group O
of O
believers O
together O
and O
gave O
them O
the O
letter O
. O

When O
the O
believers O
read O
it O
, O
they O
were O
happy O
. O

The O
letter O
comforted O
them O
. O

Judas O
and O
Silas O
, O
who O
were O
also O
prophets O
, O
said O
many O
things O
to O
encourage O
the O
believers O
and O
make O
them O
stronger O
in O
their O
faith O
. O

After O
Judas O
and O
Silas O
stayed O
there O
for O
a O
while O
, O
they O
left O
. O

They O
received O
a O
blessing O
of O
peace O
from O
the O
believers O
. O

Then O
they O
went O
back O
to O
those O
who O
had O
sent O
them O
. O

But O
Paul O
and O
Barnabas O
stayed O
in O
Antioch O
. O

They O
and O
many O
others O
taught O
the O
believers O
and O
told O
other O
people O
the O
Good O
News O
about O
the O
Lord O
. O

A O
few O
days O
later O
, O
Paul O
said O
to O
Barnabas O
, O
`` O
We O
should O
go O
back O
to O
all O
the O
towns O
where O
we O
told O
people O
the O
message O
of O
the O
Lord O
. O

We O
should O
visit O
our O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
in O
God O
's O
family O
to O
see O
how O
they O
are O
doing O
. O
'' O

Barnabas O
wanted O
to O
bring O
John O
Mark O
with O
them O
too O
. O

But O
on O
their O
first O
trip O
John O
Mark O
did O
not O
continue O
with O
them O
in O
the O
work O
. O

He O
had O
left O
them O
at O
Pamphylia O
. O

So O
Paul O
did O
not O
think O
it O
was O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
take O
him O
this O
time O
. O

Paul O
and O
Barnabas O
had O
a O
big O
argument O
about O
this O
. O

It O
was O
so O
bad O
that O
they O
separated O
and O
went O
different O
ways O
. O

Barnabas O
sailed O
to O
Cyprus O
and O
took O
Mark O
with O
him O
. O

Paul O
chose O
Silas O
to O
go O
with O
him O
. O

The O
believers O
in O
Antioch O
put O
Paul O
into O
the O
Lord O
's O
care O
and O
sent O
him O
out O
. O

Paul O
and O
Silas O
went O
through O
the O
countries O
of O
Syria O
and O
Cilicia O
, O
helping O
the O
churches O
grow O
stronger O
. O

Agrippa O
said O
to O
Paul O
, O
`` O
You O
may O
now O
speak O
to O
defend O
yourself O
. O
'' O

Paul O
raised O
his O
hand O
to O
get O
their O
attention O
and O
began O
to O
speak O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
King O
Agrippa O
, O
I O
feel O
fortunate O
that O
I O
can O
stand O
here O
before O
you O
today O
and O
answer O
all O
the O
charges O
these O
Jews O
have O
made O
against O
me O
. O

I O
am O
very O
happy O
to O
talk O
to O
you O
, O
because O
you O
know O
so O
much O
about O
all O
the O
Jewish O
customs O
and O
the O
things O
the O
Jews O
argue O
about O
. O

Please O
listen O
to O
me O
patiently O
. O

`` O
All O
the O
Jews O
know O
about O
my O
whole O
life O
. O

They O
know O
the O
way O
I O
lived O
from O
the O
beginning O
in O
my O
own O
country O
and O
later O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

These O
Jews O
have O
known O
me O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

If O
they O
want O
to O
, O
they O
can O
tell O
you O
that O
I O
was O
a O
good O
Pharisee O
. O

And O
the O
Pharisees O
obey O
the O
laws O
of O
the O
Jewish O
religion O
more O
carefully O
than O
any O
other O
group O
. O

Now O
I O
am O
on O
trial O
because O
I O
hope O
for O
the O
promise O
that O
God O
made O
to O
our O
fathers O
. O

This O
is O
the O
promise O
that O
all O
the O
twelve O
tribes O
of O
our O
people O
hope O
to O
receive O
. O

For O
this O
hope O
the O
Jews O
serve O
God O
day O
and O
night O
. O

My O
king O
, O
the O
Jews O
have O
accused O
me O
because O
I O
hope O
for O
this O
same O
promise O
. O

Why O
do O
you O
people O
think O
it O
is O
impossible O
for O
God O
to O
raise O
people O
from O
death O
? O

`` O
I O
used O
to O
think O
that O
I O
should O
do O
everything O
I O
could O
against O
Jesus O
from O
Nazareth O
. O

And O
that O
's O
what O
I O
did O
, O
beginning O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

The O
leading O
priests O
gave O
me O
the O
authority O
to O
put O
many O
of O
God O
's O
people O
in O
jail O
. O

And O
when O
they O
were O
being O
killed O
, O
I O
agreed O
that O
it O
was O
a O
good O
thing O
. O

I O
visited O
all O
the O
synagogues O
and O
punished O
them O
, O
trying O
to O
make O
them O
curse O
Jesus O
. O

My O
anger O
against O
these O
people O
was O
so O
strong O
that O
I O
went O
to O
other O
cities O
to O
find O
them O
and O
punish O
them O
. O

`` O
One O
time O
the O
leading O
priests O
gave O
me O
permission O
and O
the O
authority O
to O
go O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Damascus O
. O

On O
the O
way O
there O
, O
at O
noon O
, O
I O
saw O
a O
light O
from O
heaven O
, O
brighter O
than O
the O
sun O
. O

It O
shined O
all O
around O
me O
and O
those O
traveling O
with O
me O
. O

We O
all O
fell O
to O
the O
ground O
. O

Then O
I O
heard O
a O
voice O
talking O
to O
me O
in O
Aramaic O
. O

The O
voice O
said O
, O
' O
Saul O
, O
Saul O
, O
why O
are O
you O
persecuting O
me O
? O

You O
are O
only O
hurting O
yourself O
by O
fighting O
me O
. O
' O

`` O
I O
said O
, O
' O
Who O
are O
you O
, O
Lord O
? O
' O

`` O
The O
Lord O
said O
, O
' O
I O
am O
Jesus O
. O

I O
am O
the O
one O
you O
are O
persecuting O
. O

Stand O
up O
! O

I O
have O
chosen O
you O
to O
be O
my O
servant O
. O

You O
will O
tell O
people O
about O
me O
-- O
what O
you O
have O
seen O
today O
and O
what O
I O
will O
show O
you O
. O

This O
is O
why O
I O
have O
come O
to O
you O
. O

I O
will O
keep O
you O
safe O
from O
your O
own O
people O
and O
from O
the O
non-Jewish O
people O
, O
the O
ones O
I O
am O
sending O
you O
to O
. O

You O
will O
make O
them O
able O
to O
understand O
the O
truth O
. O

They O
will O
turn O
away O
from O
darkness O
to O
the O
light O
. O

They O
will O
turn O
away O
from O
the O
power O
of O
Satan O
, O
and O
they O
will O
turn O
to O
God O
. O

Then O
their O
sins O
can O
be O
forgiven O
, O
and O
they O
can O
be O
given O
a O
place O
among O
God O
's O
people O
-- O
those O
who O
have O
been O
made O
holy O
by O
believing O
in O
me O
. O
' O
'' O

Paul O
continued O
speaking O
: O
`` O
King O
Agrippa O
, O
after O
I O
had O
this O
vision O
from O
heaven O
, O
I O
obeyed O
it O
. O

I O
began O
telling O
people O
to O
change O
their O
hearts O
and O
lives O
and O
turn O
back O
to O
God O
. O

And O
I O
told O
them O
to O
do O
what O
would O
show O
that O
they O
had O
really O
changed O
. O

I O
went O
first O
to O
people O
in O
Damascus O
. O

Then O
I O
went O
to O
Jerusalem O
and O
to O
every O
part O
of O
Judea O
and O
told O
the O
people O
there O
. O

I O
also O
went O
to O
the O
non-Jewish O
people O
. O

`` O
This O
is O
why O
the O
Jews O
grabbed O
me O
and O
were O
trying O
to O
kill O
me O
at O
the O
Temple O
. O

But O
God O
helped O
me O
, O
and O
he O
is O
still O
helping O
me O
today O
. O

With O
God O
's O
help O
I O
am O
standing O
here O
today O
and O
telling O
all O
people O
what O
I O
have O
seen O
. O

But O
I O
am O
saying O
nothing O
new O
. O

I O
am O
saying O
only O
what O
Moses O
and O
the O
prophets O
said O
would O
happen O
. O

They O
said O
that O
the O
Christ O
would O
die O
and O
be O
the O
first O
to O
rise O
from O
death O
. O

They O
said O
that O
he O
would O
bring O
the O
light O
of O
God O
's O
saving O
truth O
to O
the O
Jewish O
people O
and O
to O
the O
non-Jewish O
people O
. O
'' O

While O
Paul O
was O
still O
defending O
himself O
, O
Festus O
shouted O
, O
`` O
Paul O
, O
you O
are O
out O
of O
your O
mind O
! O

Too O
much O
study O
has O
made O
you O
crazy O
. O
'' O

Paul O
said O
, O
`` O
Most O
Honorable O
Festus O
, O
I O
am O
not O
crazy O
. O

What O
I O
am O
saying O
is O
true O
. O

It O
all O
makes O
perfect O
sense O
. O

King O
Agrippa O
knows O
about O
all O
this O
, O
and O
I O
can O
speak O
freely O
to O
him O
. O

I O
know O
that O
he O
has O
heard O
about O
these O
things O
, O
because O
they O
happened O
where O
everyone O
could O
see O
them O
. O

King O
Agrippa O
, O
do O
you O
believe O
what O
the O
prophets O
wrote O
? O

I O
know O
you O
believe O
! O
'' O

King O
Agrippa O
said O
to O
Paul O
, O
`` O
Do O
you O
think O
you O
can O
persuade O
me O
to O
become O
a O
' O
Christ O
- O
follower O
' O
so O
easily O
? O
'' O

Paul O
said O
, O
`` O
It O
is O
not O
important O
if O
it O
is O
easy O
or O
if O
it O
is O
hard O
. O

I O
pray O
to O
God O
that O
not O
only O
you O
but O
that O
everyone O
listening O
to O
me O
today O
could O
be O
saved O
and O
be O
just O
like O
me O
-- O
except O
for O
these O
chains O
I O
have O
! O
'' O

King O
Agrippa O
, O
Governor O
Festus O
, O
Bernice O
, O
and O
all O
the O
people O
sitting O
with O
them O
stood O
up O
and O
left O
the O
room O
. O

They O
were O
talking O
to O
each O
other O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
This O
man O
has O
done O
nothing O
worthy O
of O
being O
put O
to O
death O
or O
even O
put O
in O
jail O
. O
'' O

And O
Agrippa O
said O
to O
Festus O
, O
`` O
We O
could O
let O
him O
go O
free O
, O
but O
he O
has O
asked O
to O
see O
Caesar O
. O
'' O

During O
this O
same O
time O
, O
King O
Herod O
began O
to O
persecute O
some O
of O
the O
people O
who O
were O
part O
of O
the O
church O
. O

He O
ordered O
James O
, O
the O
brother O
of O
John O
, O
to O
be O
killed O
with O
a O
sword O
. O

Herod O
saw O
that O
many O
of O
the O
Jews O
liked O
this O
, O
so O
he O
decided O
to O
arrest O
Peter O
too O
. O

This O
happened O
during O
the O
Festival O
of O
Unleavened O
Bread O
. O

He O
arrested O
Peter O
and O
put O
him O
in O
jail O
, O
where O
he O
was O
guarded O
by O
a O
group O
of O
16 O
soldiers O
. O

Herod O
planned O
to O
bring O
Peter O
before O
the O
people O
, O
but O
he O
wanted O
to O
wait O
until O
after O
the O
Passover O
festival O
. O

So O
Peter O
was O
kept O
in O
jail O
, O
but O
the O
church O
was O
constantly O
praying O
to O
God O
for O
him O
. O

One O
night O
, O
Peter O
, O
bound O
with O
two O
chains O
, O
was O
sleeping O
between O
two O
of O
the O
soldiers O
. O

More O
soldiers O
were O
guarding O
the O
door O
of O
the O
jail O
. O

Herod O
was O
planning O
to O
bring O
Peter O
out O
before O
the O
people O
the O
next O
day O
. O

Suddenly O
an O
angel O
of O
the O
Lord O
was O
standing O
there O
, O
and O
the O
room O
was O
filled O
with O
light O
. O

The O
angel O
tapped O
Peter O
on O
the O
side O
and O
woke O
him O
up O
. O

The O
angel O
said O
, O
`` O
Hurry O
, O
get O
up O
! O
'' O

The O
chains O
fell O
off O
Peter O
's O
hands O
. O

The O
angel O
said O
, O
`` O
Get O
dressed O
and O
put O
on O
your O
sandals O
. O
'' O

Peter O
did O
as O
he O
was O
told O
. O

Then O
the O
angel O
said O
, O
`` O
Put O
on O
your O
coat O
and O
follow O
me O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
angel O
went O
out O
and O
Peter O
followed O
. O

He O
did O
not O
know O
if O
the O
angel O
was O
really O
doing O
this O
. O

He O
thought O
he O
might O
be O
seeing O
a O
vision O
. O

Peter O
and O
the O
angel O
went O
past O
the O
first O
guard O
and O
the O
second O
guard O
. O

Then O
they O
came O
to O
the O
iron O
gate O
that O
separated O
them O
from O
the O
city O
. O

The O
gate O
opened O
for O
them O
by O
itself O
. O

After O
they O
went O
through O
the O
gate O
and O
walked O
about O
a O
block O
, O
the O
angel O
suddenly O
left O
. O

Peter O
realized O
then O
what O
had O
happened O
. O

He O
thought O
, O
`` O
Now O
I O
know O
that O
the O
Lord O
really O
sent O
his O
angel O
to O
me O
. O

He O
rescued O
me O
from O
Herod O
and O
from O
everything O
those O
Jews O
thought O
would O
happen O
to O
me O
. O
'' O

When O
Peter O
realized O
this O
, O
he O
went O
to O
the O
home O
of O
Mary O
, O
the O
mother O
of O
John O
, O
who O
was O
also O
called O
Mark O
. O

Many O
people O
were O
gathered O
there O
and O
were O
praying O
. O

Peter O
knocked O
on O
the O
outside O
door O
. O

A O
servant O
girl O
named O
Rhoda O
came O
to O
answer O
it O
. O

She O
recognized O
Peter O
's O
voice O
, O
and O
she O
was O
very O
happy O
. O

She O
even O
forgot O
to O
open O
the O
door O
. O

She O
ran O
inside O
and O
told O
the O
group O
, O
`` O
Peter O
is O
at O
the O
door O
! O
'' O

The O
believers O
said O
to O
her O
, O
`` O
You O
are O
crazy O
! O
'' O

But O
she O
continued O
to O
say O
that O
it O
was O
true O
. O

So O
they O
said O
, O
`` O
It O
must O
be O
Peter O
's O
angel O
. O
'' O

But O
Peter O
continued O
to O
knock O
. O

When O
the O
believers O
opened O
the O
door O
, O
they O
saw O
him O
. O

They O
were O
amazed O
. O

Peter O
made O
a O
sign O
with O
his O
hand O
to O
tell O
them O
to O
be O
quiet O
. O

He O
explained O
to O
them O
how O
the O
Lord O
led O
him O
out O
of O
the O
jail O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Tell O
James O
and O
the O
other O
brothers O
what O
happened O
. O
'' O

Then O
he O
left O
and O
went O
to O
another O
place O
. O

The O
next O
day O
the O
soldiers O
were O
very O
upset O
. O

They O
wondered O
what O
happened O
to O
Peter O
. O

Herod O
looked O
everywhere O
for O
him O
but O
could O
not O
find O
him O
. O

So O
he O
questioned O
the O
guards O
and O
then O
ordered O
that O
they O
be O
killed O
. O

Later O
, O
Herod O
moved O
from O
Judea O
. O

He O
went O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Caesarea O
and O
stayed O
there O
a O
while O
. O

Herod O
was O
very O
angry O
with O
the O
people O
from O
the O
cities O
of O
Tyre O
and O
Sidon O
. O

But O
these O
cities O
needed O
food O
from O
his O
country O
, O
so O
a O
group O
of O
them O
came O
to O
ask O
him O
for O
peace O
. O

They O
were O
able O
to O
get O
Blastus O
, O
the O
king O
's O
personal O
servant O
, O
on O
their O
side O
. O

Herod O
decided O
on O
a O
day O
to O
meet O
with O
them O
. O

On O
that O
day O
he O
was O
wearing O
a O
beautiful O
royal O
robe O
. O

He O
sat O
on O
his O
throne O
and O
made O
a O
speech O
to O
the O
people O
. O

The O
people O
shouted O
, O
`` O
This O
is O
the O
voice O
of O
a O
god O
, O
not O
a O
man O
! O
'' O

Herod O
did O
not O
give O
the O
glory O
to O
God O
. O

So O
an O
angel O
of O
the O
Lord O
caused O
him O
to O
get O
sick O
. O

He O
was O
eaten O
by O
worms O
inside O
him O
, O
and O
he O
died O
. O

The O
message O
of O
God O
was O
spreading O
, O
reaching O
more O
and O
more O
people O
. O

After O
Barnabas O
and O
Saul O
finished O
their O
work O
in O
Jerusalem O
, O
they O
returned O
to O
Antioch O
, O
taking O
John O
Mark O
with O
them O
. O

In O
the O
church O
at O
Antioch O
there O
were O
some O
prophets O
and O
teachers O
. O

They O
were O
Barnabas O
, O
Simeon O
-LRB- O
also O
called O
Niger O
-RRB- O
, O
Lucius O
-LRB- O
from O
the O
city O
of O
Cyrene O
-RRB- O
, O
Manaen O
-LRB- O
who O
had O
grown O
up O
with O
King O
Herod O
-RRB- O
, O
and O
Saul O
. O

These O
men O
were O
all O
serving O
the O
Lord O
and O
fasting O
when O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Appoint O
Barnabas O
and O
Saul O
to O
do O
a O
special O
work O
for O
me O
. O

They O
are O
the O
ones O
I O
have O
chosen O
to O
do O
it O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
church O
fasted O
and O
prayed O
. O

They O
laid O
their O
hands O
on O
Barnabas O
and O
Saul O
and O
sent O
them O
out O
. O

Barnabas O
and O
Saul O
were O
sent O
out O
by O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
. O

They O
went O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Seleucia O
. O

Then O
they O
sailed O
from O
there O
to O
the O
island O
of O
Cyprus O
. O

When O
Barnabas O
and O
Saul O
came O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Salamis O
, O
they O
told O
the O
message O
of O
God O
in O
the O
Jewish O
synagogues O
. O

John O
Mark O
was O
with O
them O
to O
help O
. O

They O
went O
across O
the O
whole O
island O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Paphos O
. O

There O
they O
met O
a O
Jewish O
man O
named O
Barjesus O
who O
did O
magic O
. O

He O
was O
a O
false O
prophet O
. O

He O
always O
stayed O
close O
to O
Sergius O
Paulus O
, O
who O
was O
the O
governor O
and O
a O
very O
smart O
man O
. O

He O
invited O
Barnabas O
and O
Saul O
to O
come O
visit O
him O
, O
because O
he O
wanted O
to O
hear O
the O
message O
of O
God O
. O

But O
the O
magician O
Elymas O
-LRB- O
as O
Barjesus O
was O
called O
in O
Greek O
-RRB- O
spoke O
against O
them O
, O
trying O
to O
stop O
the O
governor O
from O
believing O
in O
Jesus O
. O

But O
Saul O
-LRB- O
also O
known O
as O
Paul O
-RRB- O
, O
filled O
with O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
, O
looked O
hard O
at O
Elymas O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
son O
of O
the O
devil O
, O
full O
of O
lies O
and O
all O
kinds O
of O
evil O
tricks O
! O

You O
are O
an O
enemy O
of O
everything O
that O
is O
right O
. O

Will O
you O
never O
stop O
trying O
to O
change O
the O
Lord O
's O
truths O
into O
lies O
? O

Now O
the O
Lord O
will O
touch O
you O
and O
you O
will O
be O
blind O
. O

For O
a O
time O
you O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
see O
anything O
-- O
not O
even O
the O
light O
from O
the O
sun O
. O
'' O

Then O
everything O
became O
dark O
for O
Elymas O
. O

He O
walked O
around O
lost O
. O

He O
was O
trying O
to O
find O
someone O
to O
lead O
him O
by O
the O
hand O
. O

When O
the O
governor O
saw O
this O
, O
he O
believed O
. O

He O
was O
amazed O
at O
the O
teaching O
about O
the O
Lord O
. O

Paul O
and O
the O
people O
with O
him O
sailed O
away O
from O
Paphos O
. O

They O
came O
to O
Perga O
, O
a O
city O
in O
Pamphylia O
. O

There O
John O
Mark O
left O
them O
and O
returned O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

They O
continued O
their O
trip O
from O
Perga O
and O
went O
to O
Antioch O
, O
a O
city O
near O
Pisidia O
. O

On O
the O
Sabbath O
day O
they O
went O
into O
the O
Jewish O
synagogue O
and O
sat O
down O
. O

The O
Law O
of O
Moses O
and O
the O
writings O
of O
the O
prophets O
were O
read O
. O

Then O
the O
leaders O
of O
the O
synagogue O
sent O
a O
message O
to O
Paul O
and O
Barnabas O
: O
`` O
Brothers O
, O
if O
you O
have O
something O
to O
say O
that O
will O
help O
the O
people O
here O
, O
please O
speak O
. O
'' O

Paul O
stood O
up O
, O
raised O
his O
hand O
to O
get O
their O
attention O
, O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
People O
of O
Israel O
and O
all O
you O
others O
who O
worship O
the O
true O
God O
, O
please O
listen O
to O
me O
! O

The O
God O
of O
Israel O
chose O
our O
ancestors O
. O

And O
during O
the O
time O
our O
people O
lived O
in O
Egypt O
as O
foreigners O
, O
he O
made O
them O
great O
. O

Then O
he O
brought O
them O
out O
of O
that O
country O
with O
great O
power O
. O

And O
he O
was O
patient O
with O
them O
for O
40 O
years O
in O
the O
desert O
. O

God O
destroyed O
seven O
nations O
in O
the O
land O
of O
Canaan O
and O
gave O
their O
land O
to O
his O
people O
. O

All O
this O
happened O
in O
about O
450 O
years O
. O

`` O
After O
this O
, O
God O
gave O
our O
people O
judges O
until O
the O
time O
of O
Samuel O
the O
prophet O
. O

Then O
the O
people O
asked O
for O
a O
king O
. O

God O
gave O
them O
Saul O
, O
the O
son O
of O
Kish O
. O

Saul O
was O
from O
the O
tribe O
of O
Benjamin O
. O

He O
was O
king O
for O
40 O
years O
. O

After O
God O
took O
Saul O
away O
, O
God O
made O
David O
their O
king O
. O

This O
is O
what O
God O
said O
about O
David O
: O
' O
David O
, O
the O
son O
of O
Jesse O
, O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
person O
who O
does O
what O
pleases O
me O
. O

He O
will O
do O
everything O
I O
want O
him O
to O
do O
. O
' O

`` O
As O
he O
promised O
, O
God O
has O
brought O
one O
of O
David O
's O
descendants O
to O
Israel O
to O
be O
their O
Savior O
. O

That O
descendant O
is O
Jesus O
. O

Before O
he O
came O
, O
John O
told O
all O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
what O
they O
should O
do O
. O

He O
told O
them O
to O
be O
baptized O
to O
show O
they O
wanted O
to O
change O
their O
lives O
. O

When O
John O
was O
finishing O
his O
work O
, O
he O
said O
, O
' O
Who O
do O
you O
think O
I O
am O
? O

I O
am O
not O
the O
Christ O
. O

He O
is O
coming O
later O
, O
and O
I O
am O
not O
worthy O
to O
be O
the O
slave O
who O
unties O
his O
sandals O
. O
' O

`` O
My O
brothers O
, O
sons O
in O
the O
family O
of O
Abraham O
, O
and O
you O
other O
people O
who O
also O
worship O
the O
true O
God O
, O
listen O
! O

The O
news O
about O
this O
salvation O
has O
been O
sent O
to O
us O
. O

The O
Jews O
living O
in O
Jerusalem O
and O
their O
leaders O
did O
not O
realize O
that O
Jesus O
was O
the O
Savior O
. O

The O
words O
the O
prophets O
wrote O
about O
him O
were O
read O
every O
Sabbath O
day O
, O
but O
they O
did O
not O
understand O
. O

They O
condemned O
Jesus O
. O

When O
they O
did O
this O
, O
they O
made O
the O
words O
of O
the O
prophets O
come O
true O
. O

They O
could O
not O
find O
any O
real O
reason O
why O
Jesus O
should O
die O
, O
but O
they O
asked O
Pilate O
to O
kill O
him O
. O

`` O
These O
Jews O
did O
all O
the O
bad O
things O
that O
the O
Scriptures O
said O
would O
happen O
to O
Jesus O
. O

Then O
they O
took O
Jesus O
down O
from O
the O
cross O
and O
put O
him O
in O
a O
tomb O
. O

But O
God O
raised O
him O
up O
from O
death O
! O

After O
this O
, O
for O
many O
days O
, O
those O
who O
had O
gone O
with O
Jesus O
from O
Galilee O
to O
Jerusalem O
saw O
him O
. O

They O
are O
now O
his O
witnesses O
to O
our O
people O
. O

`` O
We O
tell O
you O
the O
Good O
News O
about O
the O
promise O
God O
made O
to O
our O
ancestors O
. O

We O
are O
their O
descendants O
, O
and O
God O
has O
made O
this O
promise O
come O
true O
for O
us O
. O

God O
did O
this O
by O
raising O
Jesus O
from O
death O
. O

We O
also O
read O
about O
this O
in O
Psalm O
2 O
: O
' O
You O
are O
my O
Son O
. O

Today O
I O
have O
become O
your O
Father O
. O
' O

God O
raised O
Jesus O
from O
death O
. O

Jesus O
will O
never O
go O
back O
to O
the O
grave O
and O
become O
dust O
. O

So O
God O
said O
, O
' O
I O
will O
give O
you O
the O
true O
and O
holy O
promises O
that O
I O
made O
to O
David O
. O
' O

But O
in O
another O
Psalm O
it O
says O
, O
' O
You O
will O
not O
let O
your O
Holy O
One O
rot O
in O
the O
grave O
. O
' O

David O
did O
God O
's O
will O
during O
the O
time O
he O
lived O
. O

Then O
he O
died O
and O
was O
buried O
like O
all O
his O
ancestors O
. O

And O
his O
body O
did O
rot O
in O
the O
grave O
! O

But O
the O
one O
God O
raised O
from O
death O
did O
not O
rot O
in O
the O
grave O
. O

Brothers O
, O
understand O
what O
we O
are O
telling O
you O
. O

You O
can O
have O
forgiveness O
of O
your O
sins O
through O
this O
Jesus O
. O

The O
Law O
of O
Moses O
could O
not O
free O
you O
from O
your O
sins O
. O

But O
you O
can O
be O
made O
right O
with O
God O
if O
you O
believe O
in O
Jesus O
. O

So O
be O
careful O
! O

Do O
n't O
let O
what O
the O
prophets O
said O
happen O
to O
you O
: O
' O
Listen O
, O
you O
people O
who O
doubt O
! O

You O
can O
wonder O
, O
but O
then O
go O
away O
and O
die O
; O
because O
during O
your O
time O
, O
I O
will O
do O
something O
that O
you O
will O
not O
believe O
. O

You O
will O
not O
believe O
it O
, O
even O
if O
someone O
explains O
it O
to O
you O
! O
' O
'' O

As O
Paul O
and O
Barnabas O
were O
leaving O
the O
synagogue O
, O
the O
people O
asked O
them O
to O
come O
again O
on O
the O
next O
Sabbath O
day O
and O
tell O
them O
more O
about O
these O
things O
. O

After O
the O
meeting O
, O
many O
of O
the O
people O
followed O
Paul O
and O
Barnabas O
, O
including O
many O
Jews O
and O
people O
who O
had O
changed O
their O
religion O
to O
be O
like O
Jews O
and O
worship O
the O
true O
God O
. O

Paul O
and O
Barnabas O
encouraged O
them O
to O
continue O
trusting O
in O
God O
's O
grace O
. O

On O
the O
next O
Sabbath O
day O
, O
almost O
all O
the O
people O
in O
the O
city O
came O
together O
to O
hear O
the O
word O
of O
the O
Lord O
. O

When O
the O
Jews O
there O
saw O
all O
these O
people O
, O
they O
became O
very O
jealous O
. O

Shouting O
insults O
, O
they O
argued O
against O
everything O
Paul O
said O
. O

But O
Paul O
and O
Barnabas O
spoke O
very O
boldly O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
We O
had O
to O
tell O
God O
's O
message O
to O
you O
Jews O
first O
, O
but O
you O
refuse O
to O
listen O
. O

You O
have O
made O
it O
clear O
that O
you O
are O
not O
worthy O
of O
having O
eternal O
life O
. O

So O
we O
will O
now O
go O
to O
those O
who O
are O
not O
Jews O
. O

This O
is O
what O
the O
Lord O
told O
us O
to O
do O
: O
' O
I O
have O
made O
you O
a O
light O
for O
the O
other O
nations O
, O
to O
show O
people O
all O
over O
the O
world O
the O
way O
to O
be O
saved O
. O
' O
'' O

When O
the O
non-Jewish O
people O
heard O
Paul O
say O
this O
, O
they O
were O
happy O
. O

They O
gave O
honor O
to O
the O
message O
of O
the O
Lord O
, O
and O
many O
of O
them O
believed O
it O
. O

These O
were O
the O
ones O
chosen O
to O
have O
eternal O
life O
. O

And O
so O
the O
message O
of O
the O
Lord O
was O
being O
told O
throughout O
the O
whole O
country O
. O

But O
the O
Jews O
there O
caused O
some O
of O
the O
important O
religious O
women O
and O
the O
leaders O
of O
the O
city O
to O
be O
angry O
and O
turn O
against O
Paul O
and O
Barnabas O
and O
throw O
them O
out O
of O
town O
. O

So O
Paul O
and O
Barnabas O
shook O
the O
dust O
off O
their O
feet O
. O

Then O
they O
went O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Iconium O
. O

But O
the O
Lord O
's O
followers O
in O
Antioch O
were O
happy O
and O
filled O
with O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
. O

Most O
Honorable O
Theophilus O
: O
Many O
others O
have O
tried O
to O
give O
a O
report O
of O
the O
things O
that O
happened O
among O
us O
to O
complete O
God O
's O
plan O
. O

What O
they O
have O
written O
agrees O
with O
what O
we O
learned O
from O
the O
people O
who O
saw O
those O
events O
from O
the O
beginning O
. O

They O
also O
served O
God O
by O
telling O
people O
his O
message O
. O

I O
studied O
it O
all O
carefully O
from O
the O
beginning O
. O

Then O
I O
decided O
to O
write O
it O
down O
for O
you O
in O
an O
organized O
way O
. O

I O
did O
this O
so O
that O
you O
can O
be O
sure O
that O
what O
you O
have O
been O
taught O
is O
true O
. O

During O
the O
time O
when O
Herod O
ruled O
Judea O
, O
there O
was O
a O
priest O
named O
Zechariah O
. O

He O
belonged O
to O
Abijah O
's O
group O
. O

His O
wife O
came O
from O
the O
family O
of O
Aaron O
. O

Her O
name O
was O
Elizabeth O
. O

Zechariah O
and O
Elizabeth O
were O
both O
good O
people O
who O
pleased O
God O
. O

They O
did O
everything O
the O
Lord O
commanded O
, O
always O
following O
his O
instructions O
completely O
. O

But O
they O
had O
no O
children O
. O

Elizabeth O
could O
not O
have O
a O
baby O
, O
and O
both O
of O
them O
were O
very O
old O
. O

Zechariah O
was O
serving O
as O
a O
priest O
before O
God O
for O
his O
group O
. O

It O
was O
his O
group O
's O
time O
to O
serve O
. O

The O
priests O
always O
chose O
one O
priest O
to O
offer O
the O
incense O
, O
and O
Zechariah O
was O
the O
one O
chosen O
this O
time O
. O

So O
he O
went O
into O
the O
Temple O
of O
the O
Lord O
to O
offer O
the O
incense O
. O

There O
was O
a O
large O
crowd O
outside O
praying O
at O
the O
time O
the O
incense O
was O
offered O
. O

Then O
, O
on O
the O
right O
side O
of O
the O
incense O
table O
an O
angel O
of O
the O
Lord O
came O
and O
stood O
before O
Zechariah O
. O

When O
he O
saw O
the O
angel O
, O
Zechariah O
was O
upset O
and O
very O
afraid O
. O

But O
the O
angel O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Zechariah O
, O
do O
n't O
be O
afraid O
. O

Your O
prayer O
has O
been O
heard O
by O
God O
. O

Your O
wife O
Elizabeth O
will O
give O
birth O
to O
a O
baby O
boy O
, O
and O
you O
will O
name O
him O
John O
. O

You O
will O
be O
very O
happy O
, O
and O
many O
others O
will O
share O
your O
joy O
over O
his O
birth O
. O

He O
will O
be O
a O
great O
man O
for O
the O
Lord O
. O

He O
will O
never O
drink O
wine O
or O
beer O
. O

Even O
before O
he O
is O
born O
, O
he O
will O
be O
filled O
with O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
. O

`` O
John O
will O
help O
many O
people O
of O
Israel O
return O
to O
the O
Lord O
their O
God O
. O

John O
himself O
will O
go O
ahead O
of O
the O
Lord O
and O
make O
people O
ready O
for O
his O
coming O
. O

He O
will O
be O
powerful O
like O
Elijah O
and O
will O
have O
the O
same O
spirit O
. O

He O
will O
make O
peace O
between O
fathers O
and O
their O
children O
. O

He O
will O
cause O
people O
who O
are O
not O
obeying O
God O
to O
change O
and O
start O
thinking O
the O
way O
they O
should O
. O
'' O

Zechariah O
said O
to O
the O
angel O
, O
`` O
How O
can O
I O
know O
that O
what O
you O
say O
is O
true O
? O

I O
am O
an O
old O
man O
, O
and O
my O
wife O
is O
also O
old O
. O
'' O

The O
angel O
answered O
him O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
Gabriel O
, O
the O
one O
who O
always O
stands O
ready O
before O
God O
. O

He O
sent O
me O
to O
talk O
to O
you O
and O
to O
tell O
you O
this O
good O
news O
. O

Now O
, O
listen O
! O

You O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
talk O
until O
the O
day O
when O
these O
things O
happen O
. O

You O
will O
lose O
your O
speech O
because O
you O
did O
not O
believe O
what O
I O
told O
you O
. O

But O
everything O
I O
said O
will O
really O
happen O
. O
'' O

Outside O
, O
the O
people O
were O
still O
waiting O
for O
Zechariah O
. O

They O
were O
surprised O
that O
he O
was O
staying O
so O
long O
in O
the O
Temple O
. O

Then O
Zechariah O
came O
outside O
, O
but O
he O
could O
not O
speak O
to O
them O
. O

So O
the O
people O
knew O
that O
he O
had O
seen O
a O
vision O
inside O
the O
Temple O
. O

He O
was O
not O
able O
to O
speak O
, O
so O
he O
could O
only O
make O
signs O
to O
the O
people O
. O

When O
his O
time O
of O
service O
was O
finished O
, O
he O
went O
home O
. O

Later O
, O
Zechariah O
's O
wife O
Elizabeth O
became O
pregnant O
. O

So O
she O
did O
not O
go O
out O
of O
her O
house O
for O
five O
months O
. O

She O
said O
, O
`` O
Look O
what O
the O
Lord O
has O
done O
for O
me O
! O

He O
decided O
to O
help O
me O
. O

Now O
people O
will O
stop O
thinking O
there O
is O
something O
wrong O
with O
me O
. O
'' O

During O
Elizabeth O
's O
sixth O
month O
of O
pregnancy O
, O
God O
sent O
the O
angel O
Gabriel O
to O
a O
virgin O
girl O
who O
lived O
in O
Nazareth O
, O
a O
town O
in O
Galilee O
. O

She O
was O
engaged O
to O
marry O
a O
man O
named O
Joseph O
from O
the O
family O
of O
David O
. O

Her O
name O
was O
Mary O
. O

The O
angel O
came O
to O
her O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Greetings O
! O

The O
Lord O
is O
with O
you O
; O
you O
are O
very O
special O
to O
him O
. O
'' O

But O
Mary O
was O
very O
confused O
about O
what O
the O
angel O
said O
. O

She O
wondered O
, O
`` O
What O
does O
this O
mean O
? O
'' O

The O
angel O
said O
to O
her O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
be O
afraid O
, O
Mary O
, O
because O
God O
is O
very O
pleased O
with O
you O
. O

Listen O
! O

You O
will O
become O
pregnant O
and O
have O
a O
baby O
boy O
. O

You O
will O
name O
him O
Jesus O
. O

He O
will O
be O
great O
. O

People O
will O
call O
him O
the O
Son O
of O
the O
Most O
High O
God O
, O
and O
the O
Lord O
God O
will O
make O
him O
king O
like O
his O
ancestor O
David O
. O

He O
will O
rule O
over O
the O
people O
of O
Jacob O
forever O
; O
his O
kingdom O
will O
never O
end O
. O
'' O

Mary O
said O
to O
the O
angel O
, O
`` O
How O
will O
this O
happen O
? O

I O
am O
still O
a O
virgin O
. O
'' O

The O
angel O
said O
to O
Mary O
, O
`` O
The O
Holy O
Spirit O
will O
come O
to O
you O
, O
and O
the O
power O
of O

will O
cover O
you O

The O
baby O
will O
be O
holy O
and O
will O
be O
called O
the O
Son O
of O
God O
. O

And O
here O
's O
something O
else O
: O
Your O
relative O
Elizabeth O
is O
pregnant O
. O

She O
is O
very O
old O
, O
but O
she O
is O
going O
to O
have O
a O
son O
. O

Everyone O
thought O
she O
could O
not O
have O
a O
baby O
, O
but O
she O
has O
been O
pregnant O
now O
for O
six O
months O
. O

God O
can O
do O
anything O
! O
'' O

Mary O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
the O
servant O
of O
the O
Lord O
God O
. O

Let O
this O
thing O
you O
have O
said O
happen O
to O
me O
! O
'' O

Then O
the O
angel O
went O
away O
. O

Mary O
got O
up O
and O
went O
quickly O
to O
a O
town O
in O
the O
hill O
country O
of O
Judea O
. O

She O
went O
into O
Zechariah O
's O
house O
and O
greeted O
Elizabeth O
. O

When O
Elizabeth O
heard O
Mary O
's O
greeting O
, O
the O
unborn O
baby O
inside O
her O
jumped O
, O
and O
she O
was O
filled O
with O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
. O

In O
a O
loud O
voice O
she O
said O
to O
Mary O
, O
`` O
God O
has O
blessed O
you O
more O
than O
any O
other O
woman O

And O
God O
has O
blessed O
the O
baby O
you O
will O
have O

You O
are O
the O
mother O
of O
my O
Lord O

and O
you O
have O
come O
to O
me O
! O

Why O
has O
something O
so O
good O
happened O
to O
me O
? O

When O
I O
heard O
your O
voice O
, O
the O
baby O
inside O
me O
jumped O
with O
joy O
. O

Great O
blessings O
are O
yours O
because O
you O
believed O
what O
the O
Lord O
said O
to O
you O
! O

You O
believed O
this O
would O
happen O

'' O

Then O
Mary O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
praise O
the O
Lord O

all O
my O
heart O

I O
am O
very O
happy O
because O
God O
is O
my O
Savior O

I O
am O
not O
important O
, O
but O
he O
has O
shown O
his O
care O
for O
me O
, O
his O
lowly O
servant O

From O
now O
until O
the O
end O
of O
time O
, O
people O
will O
remember O
how O
much O
God O
blessed O
me O

Yes O
, O
the O
Powerful O
One O
has O
done O
great O
things O
for O
me O

His O
name O
is O
very O
holy O
. O

He O
always O
gives O
mercy O
to O
those O
who O
worship O
him O
. O

He O
reached O
out O
his O
arm O
and O
showed O
his O
power O
. O

He O
scattered O
those O
who O
are O
proud O
and O
think O
great O
things O
about O
themselves O
. O

He O
brought O
down O
rulers O
from O
their O
thrones O
and O
raised O
up O
the O
humble O
people O

He O
filled O
the O
hungry O
with O
good O
things O
, O

he O
sent O
the O
rich O
away O
with O
nothing O
. O

God O
has O
helped O
Israel O
-- O
the O
people O
he O
chose O
to O
serve O
him O
. O

He O
did O
not O
forget O
his O
promise O
to O
give O
us O
his O
mercy O

He O
has O
done O
what O
he O
promised O
to O
our O
ancestors O
, O
to O
Abraham O
and O
his O
children O
forever O
. O
'' O

Mary O
stayed O
with O
Elizabeth O
for O
about O
three O
months O
and O
then O
went O
home O
. O

When O
it O
was O
time O
for O
Elizabeth O
to O
give O
birth O
, O
she O
had O
a O
boy O
. O

Her O
neighbors O
and O
relatives O
heard O
that O
the O
Lord O
was O
very O
good O
to O
her O
, O
and O
they O
were O
happy O
for O
her O
. O

When O
the O
baby O
was O
eight O
days O
old O
, O
they O
came O
to O
circumcise O
him O
. O

They O
wanted O
to O
name O
him O
Zechariah O
because O
this O
was O
his O
father O
's O
name O
. O

But O
his O
mother O
said O
, O
`` O
No O
, O
he O
will O
be O
named O
John O
. O
'' O
The O
people O
said O
to O
Elizabeth O
, O
`` O
But O
no O
one O
in O
your O
family O
has O
that O
name O

'' O

Then O
they O
made O
signs O
to O
his O
father O
, O
`` O
What O
would O
you O
like O
to O
name O
him O
? O
'' O

Zechariah O
asked O
for O
something O
to O
write O
on O
. O

Then O
he O
wrote O
, O
`` O
His O
name O
is O
John O
. O
'' O
Everyone O
was O
surprised O
. O

Then O
Zechariah O
could O
talk O
again O
, O
and O
he O
began O
praising O
God O
. O

And O
all O
their O
neighbors O
were O
afraid O
. O

In O
all O
the O
hill O
country O
of O
Judea O
people O
continued O
talking O
about O
these O
things O
. O

Everyone O
who O
heard O
about O
these O
things O
wondered O
about O
them O
. O

They O
thought O
, O
`` O
What O
will O
this O
child O
be O
? O
'' O

They O
could O
see O
that O
the O
Lord O
was O
with O
him O
. O

Then O
Zechariah O
, O
John O
's O
father O
, O
was O
filled O
with O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
and O
told O
the O
people O
a O
message O
from O
God O
: O
`` O
Praise O
to O
the O
Lord O
God O
of O
Israel O
. O

He O
has O
come O
to O
help O
his O
people O
and O
has O
given O
them O
freedom O
. O

He O
has O
given O
us O
a O
powerful O
Savior O
from O
the O
family O
of O
his O
servant O
David O
. O

This O
is O
what O
he O
promised O
through O
his O
holy O
prophets O
long O
ago O
. O

He O
will O
save O
us O
from O
our O
enemies O
and O
from O
the O
power O
of O
all O
those O
who O
hate O
us O
. O

God O
said O
he O
would O
show O
mercy O
to O
our O
fathers O
, O
and O
he O
remembered O
his O
holy O
agreement O
. O

This O
was O
the O
promise O
he O
made O
to O
our O
father O
Abraham O
, O
a O
promise O
to O
free O
us O
from O
the O
power O
of O
our O
enemies O
, O
so O
that O
we O
could O
serve O
him O
without O
fear O
in O
a O
way O
that O
is O
holy O
and O
right O
for O
as O
long O
as O
we O
live O
. O

`` O
Now O
you O
, O
little O
boy O
, O
will O
be O
called O
a O
prophet O
of O
the O
Most O
High O
God O
. O

You O
will O
go O
first O
before O
the O
Lord O
to O
prepare O
the O
way O
for O
him O
. O

You O
will O
make O
his O
people O
understand O
that O
they O
will O
be O
saved O
by O
having O
their O
sins O
forgiven O
. O

`` O
With O
the O
loving O
mercy O
of O
our O
God O
, O
a O
new O
day O
from O
heaven O
will O
shine O
on O
us O
. O

It O
will O
bring O
light O
to O
those O
who O
live O
in O
darkness O
, O
in O
the O
fear O
of O
death O
. O

It O
will O
guide O
us O
into O
the O
way O
that O
brings O
peace O

'' O

And O
so O
the O
little O
boy O
John O
grew O
up O
and O
became O
stronger O
in O
spirit O
. O

Then O
he O
lived O
in O
areas O
away O
from O
other O
people O
until O
the O
time O
when O
he O
came O
out O
to O
tell O
God O
's O
message O
to O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
. O

Then O
Jesus O
taught O
the O
followers O
that O
they O
should O
always O
pray O
and O
never O
lose O
hope O
. O

He O
used O
this O
story O
to O
teach O
them O
: O
`` O
Once O
there O
was O
a O
judge O
in O
a O
town O
. O

He O
did O
not O
care O
about O
God O
. O

He O
also O
did O
not O
care O
what O
people O
thought O
about O
him O
. O

In O
that O
same O
town O
there O
was O
a O
woman O
whose O
husband O
had O
died O
. O

She O
came O
many O
times O
to O
this O
judge O
and O
said O
, O
' O
There O
is O
a O
man O
who O
is O
doing O
bad O
things O
to O
me O
. O

Give O
me O
my O
rights O
! O
' O

But O
the O
judge O
did O
not O
want O
to O
help O
the O
woman O
. O

After O
a O
long O
time O
, O
the O
judge O
thought O
to O
himself O
, O
' O
I O
do O
n't O
care O
about O
God O
. O

And O
I O
do O
n't O
care O
about O
what O
people O
think O
. O

But O
this O
woman O
is O
bothering O
me O
. O

If O
I O
give O
her O
what O
she O
wants O
, O
then O
she O
will O
leave O
me O
alone O

But O
if O
I O
do O
n't O
give O
her O
what O
she O
wants O
, O
she O
will O
bother O
me O
until O
I O
am O
sick O

' O
'' O

The O
Lord O
said O
, O
`` O
Listen O
, O
there O
is O
meaning O
in O
what O
the O
bad O
judge O
said O

to O
him O
night O
and O
day O
, O
and O
he O
will O
always O
give O
them O
what O
is O
right O

He O
will O
not O
be O
slow O
to O
answer O
them O
. O

I O
tell O
you O
, O
God O
will O
help O
his O
people O
quickly O

But O
when O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O
comes O
again O
, O
will O
he O
find O
people O
on O
earth O
who O
believe O
in O
him O
? O
'' O

There O
were O
some O
people O
who O
thought O
they O
were O
very O
good O
and O
looked O
down O
on O
everyone O
else O
. O

Jesus O
used O
this O
story O
to O
teach O
them O
: O
`` O
One O
time O
there O
was O
a O
Pharisee O
and O
a O
tax O
collector O
. O

One O
day O
they O
both O
went O
to O
the O
Temple O
to O
pray O
. O

The O
Pharisee O
stood O
alone O
, O
away O
from O
the O
tax O
collector O
. O

When O
the O
Pharisee O
prayed O
, O
he O
said O
, O
O O
God O
, O
I O
thank O
you O
that O
I O
am O
not O
as O
bad O
as O
other O
people O

I O
am O
not O
like O
men O
who O
steal O
, O
cheat O
, O
or O
commit O
adultery O

I O
thank O
you O
that O
I O
am O
better O
than O
this O
tax O
collector O

I O
fast O
twice O
a O
week O

and O
I O
give O
a O
tenth O
of O
everything O
I O

' O

`` O
The O
tax O
collector O
stood O
alone O
too O

But O
when O
he O
prayed O
, O
he O
would O
not O
even O
look O
up O
to O
heaven O

He O
felt O
very O
humble O
before O
God O
. O

He O
said O
, O
O O
God O
, O
have O
mercy O
on O
me O
. O

I O
am O
a O
sinner O
! O
' O

I O
tell O
you O
, O
when O
this O
man O
finished O
his O
prayer O
and O
went O
home O
, O
he O
was O
right O
with O
God O
. O

But O
the O
Pharisee O
, O
who O
felt O
that O
he O
was O
better O
than O
others O
, O
was O
not O
right O
with O
God O
. O

People O
who O
make O
themselves O
important O
will O
be O
made O
humble O
. O

But O
those O
who O
make O
themselves O
humble O
will O
be O
made O
important O
. O
'' O

Some O
people O
brought O
their O
small O
children O
to O
Jesus O
so O
that O
he O
could O
lay O
his O
hands O
on O
them O
to O
bless O
them O
. O

But O
when O
the O
followers O
saw O
this O
, O
they O
told O
the O
people O
not O
to O
do O
this O
. O

But O
Jesus O
called O
the O
little O
children O
to O
him O
and O
said O
to O
his O
followers O
, O
`` O
Let O
the O
little O
children O
come O
to O
me O
. O

Do O
n't O
stop O
them O
, O
because O
God O
's O
kingdom O
belongs O
to O
people O
who O
are O
like O
these O
little O
children O
. O

The O
truth O
is O
, O
you O
must O
accept O
God O
's O
kingdom O
like O
a O
little O
child O
accepts O
things O
, O
or O
you O
will O
never O
enter O
it O
. O
'' O

A O
religious O
leader O
asked O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
Good O
Teacher O
, O
what O
must O
I O
do O
to O
get O
eternal O
life O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Why O
do O
you O
call O
me O
good O
? O

Only O
God O
is O
good O
. O

And O
you O
know O
his O
commands O
: O
' O
You O
must O
not O
commit O
adultery O
, O
you O
must O
not O
murder O
anyone O
, O
you O
must O
not O
steal O
, O
you O
must O
not O
tell O
lies O
about O
others O
, O
you O
must O
respect O
your O
father O
and O
mother O
. O
. O
. O
. O
' O
'' O

But O
the O
leader O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
have O
obeyed O
all O
these O
commands O
since O
I O
was O
a O
boy O
. O
'' O

When O
Jesus O
heard O
this O
, O
he O
said O
to O
the O
leader O
, O
`` O
But O
there O
is O
still O
one O
thing O
you O
need O
to O
do O
. O

Sell O
everything O
you O
have O
and O
give O
the O
money O
to O
those O
who O
are O
poor O
. O

You O
will O
have O
riches O
in O
heaven O
. O

Then O
come O
and O
follow O
me O
. O
'' O

But O
when O
the O
man O
heard O
Jesus O
tell O
him O
to O
give O
away O
his O
money O
, O
he O
was O
sad O
. O

He O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
do O
this O
, O
because O
he O
was O
very O
rich O
. O

When O
Jesus O
saw O
that O
the O
man O
was O
sad O
, O
he O
said O
, O
`` O
It O
will O
be O
very O
hard O
for O
rich O
people O
to O
enter O
God O
's O
kingdom O
. O

It O
is O
easier O
for O
a O
camel O
to O
go O
through O
the O
eye O
of O
a O
needle O
than O
for O
a O
rich O
person O
to O
enter O
God O
's O
kingdom O
. O
'' O

When O
the O
people O
heard O
this O
, O
they O
said O
, O
`` O
Then O
who O
can O
be O
saved O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
God O
can O
do O
things O
that O
are O
not O
possible O
for O
people O
to O
do O
. O
'' O

Peter O
said O
, O
`` O
Look O
, O
we O
left O
everything O
we O
had O
and O
followed O
you O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
can O
promise O
that O
everyone O
who O
has O
left O
their O
home O
, O
wife O
, O
brothers O
, O
parents O
, O
or O
children O
for O
God O
's O
kingdom O
will O
get O
much O
more O
than O
they O
left O
. O

They O
will O
get O
many O
times O
more O
in O
this O
life O
. O

And O
in O
the O
world O
that O
is O
coming O
they O
will O
get O
the O
reward O
of O
eternal O
life O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
talked O
to O
the O
twelve O
apostles O
alone O
. O

He O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Listen O
, O
we O
are O
going O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

Everything O
that O
God O
told O
the O
prophets O
to O
write O
about O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O
will O
happen O
. O

He O
will O
be O
handed O
over O
to O
the O
foreigners O
, O
who O
will O
laugh O
at O
him O
, O
insult O
him O
, O
and O
spit O
on O
him O
. O

They O
will O
beat O
him O
with O
whips O
and O
then O
kill O
him O
. O

But O
on O
the O
third O
day O
after O
his O
death O
, O
he O
will O
rise O
to O
life O
again O
. O
'' O

The O
apostles O
tried O
to O
understand O
this O
, O
but O
they O
could O
not O
; O
the O
meaning O
was O
hidden O
from O
them O
. O

Jesus O
came O
near O
the O
city O
of O
Jericho O
. O

There O
was O
a O
blind O
man O
sitting O
beside O
the O
road O
. O

He O
was O
begging O
people O
for O
money O
. O

When O
he O
heard O
the O
people O
coming O
down O
the O
road O
, O
he O
asked O
, O
`` O
What O
is O
happening O
? O
'' O

They O
told O
him O
, O
`` O
Jesus O
, O
the O
one O
from O
Nazareth O
, O
is O
coming O
here O
. O
'' O

The O
blind O
man O
was O
excited O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Jesus O
, O
Son O
of O
David O
, O
please O
help O
me O
! O
'' O

The O
people O
who O
were O
in O
front O
, O
leading O
the O
group O
, O
criticized O
the O
blind O
man O
. O

They O
told O
him O
to O
be O
quiet O
. O

But O
he O
shouted O
more O
and O
more O
, O
`` O
Son O
of O
David O
, O
please O
help O
me O
! O
'' O

Jesus O
stopped O
there O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Bring O
that O
man O
to O
me O
! O
'' O

When O
he O
came O
close O
, O
Jesus O
asked O
him O
, O
`` O
What O
do O
you O
want O
me O
to O
do O
for O
you O
? O
'' O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
I O
want O
to O
see O
again O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
You O
can O
see O
now O
. O

You O
are O
healed O
because O
you O
believed O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
man O
was O
able O
to O
see O
. O

He O
followed O
Jesus O
, O
thanking O
God O
. O

Everyone O
who O
saw O
this O
praised O
God O
for O
what O
happened O
. O

Very O
early O
Sunday O
morning O
, O
the O
women O
came O
to O
the O
tomb O
where O
Jesus O
' O
body O
was O
laid O
. O

They O
brought O
the O
sweet O
- O
smelling O
spices O
they O
had O
prepared O
. O

They O
saw O
that O
the O
heavy O
stone O
that O
covered O
the O
entrance O
had O
been O
rolled O
away O
. O

They O
went O
in O
, O
but O
they O
did O
not O
find O
the O
body O
of O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
. O

They O
did O
not O
understand O
this O
. O

While O
they O
were O
wondering O
about O
it O
, O
two O
men O
in O
shining O
clothes O
stood O
beside O
them O
. O

The O
women O
were O
very O
afraid O
. O

They O
bowed O
down O
with O
their O
faces O
to O
the O
ground O
. O

The O
men O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Why O
are O
you O
looking O
for O
a O
living O
person O
here O
? O

This O
is O
a O
place O
for O
dead O
people O
. O

Jesus O
is O
not O
here O
. O

He O
has O
risen O
from O
death O
. O

Do O
you O
remember O
what O
he O
said O
in O
Galilee O
? O

He O
said O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O
must O
be O
handed O
over O
to O
the O
control O
of O
sinful O
men O
, O
be O
killed O
on O
a O
cross O
, O
and O
rise O
from O
death O
on O
the O
third O
day O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
women O
remembered O
what O
Jesus O
had O
said O
. O

The O
women O
left O
the O
tomb O
and O
went O
to O
the O
eleven O
apostles O
and O
the O
other O
followers O
. O

They O
told O
them O
everything O
that O
happened O
at O
the O
tomb O
. O

These O
women O
were O
Mary O
Magdalene O
, O
Joanna O
, O
Mary O
, O
the O
mother O
of O
James O
, O
and O
some O
others O
. O

They O
told O
the O
apostles O
everything O
that O
happened O
. O

But O
the O
apostles O
did O
not O
believe O
what O
they O
said O
. O

It O
sounded O
like O
nonsense O
. O

But O
Peter O
got O
up O
and O
ran O
to O
the O
tomb O
to O
see O
. O

He O
looked O
in O
, O
but O
he O
saw O
only O
the O
cloth O
that O
Jesus O
' O
body O
had O
been O
wrapped O
in O
. O

It O
was O
just O
lying O
there O
. O

Peter O
went O
away O
to O
be O
alone O
, O
wondering O
what O
had O
happened O
. O

That O
same O
day O
two O
of O
Jesus O
' O
followers O
were O
going O
to O
a O
town O
named O
Emmaus O
. O

It O
is O
about O
seven O
miles O
from O
Jerusalem O
. O

They O
were O
talking O
about O
everything O
that O
had O
happened O
. O

While O
they O
were O
talking O
, O
discussing O
these O
things O
, O
Jesus O
himself O
came O
near O
and O
walked O
with O
them O
. O

-LRB- O
But O
the O
two O
men O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
recognize O
Jesus O
. O
-RRB- O

He O
asked O
them O
, O
`` O
What O
's O
this O
I O
hear O
you O
discussing O
with O
each O
other O
as O
you O
walk O
? O
'' O

The O
two O
men O
stopped O
, O
their O
faces O
looking O
very O
sad O
. O

The O
one O
named O
Cleopas O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
must O
be O
the O
only O
person O
in O
Jerusalem O
who O
does O
n't O
know O
what O
has O
just O
happened O
there O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
What O
are O
you O
talking O
about O
? O
'' O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
It O
's O
about O
Jesus O
, O
the O
one O
from O
Nazareth O
. O

To O
God O
and O
to O
all O
the O
people O
he O
was O
a O
great O
prophet O
. O

He O
said O
and O
did O
many O
powerful O
things O
. O

But O
our O
leaders O
and O
the O
leading O
priests O
handed O
him O
over O
to O
be O
judged O
and O
killed O
. O

They O
nailed O
him O
to O
a O
cross O
. O

We O
were O
hoping O
that O
he O
would O
be O
the O
one O
to O
free O
Israel O
. O

But O
then O
all O
this O
happened O
. O

`` O
And O
now O
something O
else O
: O
It O
has O
been O
three O
days O
since O
he O
was O
killed O
, O
but O
today O
some O
of O
our O
women O
told O
us O
an O
amazing O
thing O
. O

Early O
this O
morning O
they O
went O
to O
the O
tomb O
where O
the O
body O
of O
Jesus O
was O
laid O
. O

But O
they O
did O
not O
find O
his O
body O
there O
. O

They O
came O
and O
told O
us O
they O
had O
seen O
some O
angels O
in O
a O
vision O
. O

The O
angels O
told O
them O
Jesus O
was O
alive O
! O

So O
some O
of O
our O
group O
went O
to O
the O
tomb O
too O
. O

It O
was O
just O
as O
the O
women O
said O
. O

They O
saw O
the O
tomb O
, O
but O
they O
did O
not O
see O
Jesus O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
to O
the O
two O
men O
, O
`` O
You O
are O
foolish O
and O
slow O
to O
realize O
what O
is O
true O
. O

You O
should O
believe O
everything O
the O
prophets O
said O
. O

The O
prophets O
said O
the O
Christ O
must O
suffer O
these O
things O
before O
he O
begins O
his O
time O
of O
glory O
. O
'' O

Then O
he O
began O
to O
explain O
everything O
that O
had O
been O
written O
about O
himself O
in O
the O
Scriptures O
. O

He O
started O
with O
the O
books O
of O
Moses O
and O
then O
he O
talked O
about O
what O
the O
prophets O
had O
said O
about O
him O
. O

They O
came O
near O
the O
town O
of O
Emmaus O
, O
and O
Jesus O
acted O
as O
if O
he O
did O
not O
plan O
to O
stop O
there O
. O

But O
they O
wanted O
him O
to O
stay O
. O

They O
begged O
him O
, O
`` O
Stay O
with O
us O
. O

It O
's O
almost O
night O
. O

There O
's O
hardly O
any O
daylight O
left O
. O
'' O

So O
he O
went O
in O
to O
stay O
with O
them O
. O

Joining O
them O
at O
the O
supper O
table O
, O
Jesus O
took O
some O
bread O
and O
gave O
thanks O
. O

Then O
he O
broke O
some O
off O
and O
gave O
it O
to O
them O
. O

Just O
then O
the O
men O
were O
allowed O
to O
recognize O
him O
. O

But O
when O
they O
saw O
who O
he O
was O
, O
he O
disappeared O
. O

They O
said O
to O
each O
other O
, O
`` O
When O
he O
talked O
to O
us O
on O
the O
road O
, O
it O
felt O
like O
a O
fire O
burning O
in O
us O
. O

How O
exciting O
it O
was O
when O
he O
explained O
to O
us O
the O
true O
meaning O
of O
the O
Scriptures O
! O
'' O

So O
the O
two O
men O
got O
up O
then O
and O
went O
back O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

There O
they O
found O
the O
followers O
of O
Jesus O
meeting O
together O
. O

The O
eleven O
apostles O
and O
the O
people O
with O
them O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
Lord O
really O
has O
risen O
from O
death O
! O

He O
appeared O
to O
Simon O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
two O
men O
told O
what O
had O
happened O
on O
the O
road O
. O

They O
talked O
about O
how O
they O
recognized O
Jesus O
when O
he O
shared O
the O
bread O
with O
them O
. O

While O
the O
two O
men O
were O
saying O
these O
things O
to O
the O
other O
followers O
, O
Jesus O
himself O
came O
and O
stood O
among O
them O
. O

He O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Peace O
be O
with O
you O
. O
'' O

This O
surprised O
the O
followers O
. O

They O
were O
afraid O
. O

They O
thought O
they O
were O
seeing O
a O
ghost O
. O

But O
Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Why O
are O
you O
troubled O
? O

Why O
do O
you O
doubt O
what O
you O
see O
? O

Look O
at O
my O
hands O
and O
my O
feet O
. O

It O
's O
really O
me O
. O

Touch O
me O
. O

You O
can O
see O
that O
I O
have O
a O
living O
body O
; O
a O
ghost O
does O
not O
have O
a O
body O
like O
this O
. O
'' O

After O
Jesus O
told O
them O
this O
, O
he O
showed O
them O
his O
hands O
and O
his O
feet O
. O

The O
followers O
were O
amazed O
and O
very O
, O
very O
happy O
to O
see O
that O
Jesus O
was O
alive O
. O

They O
still O
could O
not O
believe O
what O
they O
saw O
. O

He O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Do O
you O
have O
any O
food O
here O
? O
'' O

They O
gave O
him O
a O
piece O
of O
cooked O
fish O
. O

While O
the O
followers O
watched O
, O
he O
took O
the O
fish O
and O
ate O
it O
. O

Jesus O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Remember O
when O
I O
was O
with O
you O
before O
? O

I O
said O
that O
everything O
written O
about O
me O
must O
happen O
-- O
everything O
written O
in O
the O
Law O
of O
Moses O
, O
the O
books O
of O
the O
prophets O
, O
and O
the O
Psalms O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
helped O
the O
followers O
understand O
these O
Scriptures O
about O
him O
. O

Jesus O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
It O
is O
written O
that O
the O
Christ O
would O
be O
killed O
and O
rise O
from O
death O

the O
third O
day O

You O
saw O
these O
things O
happen O
-- O
you O
are O
witnesses O

You O
must O
go O
and O
tell O
people O
that O
they O
must O
change O
and O
turn O
to O
God O
, O
which O
will O
bring O
them O
his O
forgiveness O

You O
must O
start O
from O
Jerusalem O
and O
tell O
this O
message O
in O
my O
name O
to O
the O
people O
of O
all O
nations O
. O

Remember O
that O
I O
will O
send O
you O
the O
one O
my O
Father O
promised O
. O

Stay O
in O
the O
city O
until O
you O
are O
given O
that O
power O
from O
heaven O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
led O
his O
followers O
out O
of O
Jerusalem O
almost O
to O
Bethany O
. O

He O
raised O
his O
hands O
and O
blessed O
his O
followers O
. O

While O
he O
was O
blessing O
them O
, O
he O
was O
separated O
from O
them O
and O
carried O
into O
heaven O
. O

They O
worshiped O
him O
and O
went O
back O
to O
Jerusalem O
very O
happy O
. O

They O
stayed O
at O
the O
Temple O
all O
the O
time O
, O
praising O
God O
. O

Then O
the O
whole O
group O
stood O
up O
and O
led O
Jesus O
away O
to O
Pilate O
. O

They O
began O
to O
accuse O
Jesus O
and O
said O
to O
Pilate O
, O
`` O
We O
caught O
this O
man O
trying O
to O
change O
the O
thinking O
of O
our O
people O
. O

He O
says O
we O
should O
not O
pay O
taxes O
to O
Caesar O
. O

He O
calls O
himself O
the O
Christ O
, O
a O
king O
. O
'' O

Pilate O
asked O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
Are O
you O
the O
king O
of O
the O
Jews O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
what O
you O
say O
is O
true O
. O
'' O

Pilate O
said O
to O
the O
leading O
priests O
and O
the O
people O
, O
`` O

I O
find O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
this O
man O
. O
'' O

But O
they O
kept O
on O
saying O
, O
`` O
His O
teaching O
is O
causing O
trouble O
all O
over O
Judea O
. O

He O
began O
in O
Galilee O
, O
and O
now O
he O
is O
here O
! O
'' O

Pilate O
heard O
this O
and O
asked O
if O
Jesus O
was O
from O
Galilee O
. O

He O
learned O
that O
Jesus O
was O
under O
Herod O
's O
authority O
. O

Herod O
was O
in O
Jerusalem O
at O
that O
time O
, O
so O
Pilate O
sent O
Jesus O
to O
him O
. O

When O
Herod O
saw O
Jesus O
, O
he O
was O
very O
happy O
. O

He O
had O
heard O
all O
about O
him O
and O
had O
wanted O
to O
meet O
him O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

Herod O
wanted O
to O
see O
a O
miracle O
, O
so O
he O
was O
hoping O
that O
Jesus O
would O
do O
one O
. O

He O
asked O
him O
many O
questions O
, O
but O
Jesus O
said O
nothing O
. O

The O
leading O
priests O
and O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
were O
standing O
there O
shouting O
things O
against O
Jesus O
. O

Then O
Herod O
and O
his O
soldiers O
laughed O
at O
him O
. O

They O
made O
fun O
of O
him O
by O
dressing O
him O
in O
clothes O
like O
kings O
wear O
. O

Then O
Herod O
sent O
him O
back O
to O
Pilate O
. O

In O
the O
past O
Pilate O
and O
Herod O
had O
always O
been O
enemies O
. O

But O
on O
that O
day O
they O
became O
friends O
. O

Pilate O
called O
all O
the O
people O
together O
with O
the O
leading O
priests O
and O
the O
Jewish O
leaders O
. O

He O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
You O
brought O
this O
man O
to O
me O
. O

You O
said O
he O
was O
trying O
to O
change O
the O
people O
. O

But O
I O
judged O
him O
before O
you O
all O
and O
have O
not O
found O
him O
guilty O
of O
the O
things O
you O
say O
he O
has O
done O
. O

Herod O
did O
n't O
find O
him O
guilty O
either O
. O

He O
sent O
him O
back O
to O
us O
. O

Look O
, O
he O
has O
done O
nothing O
bad O
enough O
for O
the O
death O
penalty O
. O

So O
, O
after O
I O
punish O
him O
a O
little O
, O
I O
will O
let O
him O
go O
free O
. O
'' O

But O
they O
all O
shouted O
, O
`` O
Kill O
him O
! O

Let O
Barabbas O
go O
free O
! O
'' O

-LRB- O
Barabbas O
was O
a O
man O
who O
was O
in O
jail O
for O
starting O
a O
riot O
in O
the O
city O
and O
for O
murder O
. O
-RRB- O

Pilate O
wanted O
to O
let O
Jesus O
go O
free O
. O

So O
again O
Pilate O
told O
them O
that O
he O
would O
let O
him O
go O
. O

But O
they O
shouted O
again O
, O
`` O
Kill O
him O
! O

Kill O
him O
on O
a O
cross O
! O
'' O

A O
third O
time O
Pilate O
said O
to O
the O
people O
, O
`` O
Why O
? O

What O
wrong O
has O
he O
done O
? O

He O
is O
not O
guilty O
. O

I O
can O
find O
no O
reason O
to O
kill O
him O
. O

So O
I O
will O
let O
him O
go O
free O
after O
I O
punish O
him O
a O
little O
. O
'' O

But O
the O
people O
continued O
to O
shout O
. O

They O
demanded O
that O
Jesus O
be O
killed O
on O
a O
cross O
. O

Their O
shouting O
got O
so O
loud O
that O
Pilate O
decided O
to O
give O
them O
what O
they O
wanted O
. O

They O
wanted O
Barabbas O
to O
go O
free O
-- O
the O
one O
who O
was O
in O
jail O
for O
starting O
a O
riot O
and O
for O
murder O
. O

Pilate O
let O
Barabbas O
go O
free O
. O

And O
he O
handed O
Jesus O
over O
to O
be O
killed O
. O

This O
is O
what O
the O
people O
wanted O
. O

The O
soldiers O
led O
Jesus O
away O
. O

At O
that O
same O
time O
there O
was O
a O
man O
from O
Cyrene O
named O
Simon O
coming O
into O
the O
city O
from O
the O
fields O
. O

The O
soldiers O
forced O
him O
to O
carry O
Jesus O
' O
cross O
and O
walk O
behind O
him O
. O

A O
large O
crowd O
followed O
Jesus O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
women O
were O
sad O
and O
crying O
. O

They O
felt O
sorry O
for O
him O
. O

But O
Jesus O
turned O
and O
said O
to O
the O
women O
, O
`` O
Women O
of O
Jerusalem O
, O
do O
n't O
cry O
for O
me O
. O

Cry O
for O
yourselves O
and O
for O
your O
children O
too O
. O

The O
time O
is O
coming O
when O
people O
will O
say O
, O
' O
The O
women O
who O
can O
not O
have O
babies O
are O
the O
ones O
God O
has O
blessed O
. O

It O
's O
really O
a O
blessing O
that O
they O
have O
no O
children O
to O
care O
for O
. O
' O

Then O
the O
people O
will O
say O
to O
the O
mountains O
, O
' O
Fall O
on O
us O
! O
' O

They O
will O
say O
to O
the O
hills O
, O
' O
Cover O
us O
! O
' O

If O
this O
can O
happen O
to O
someone O
who O
is O
good O
, O
what O
will O
happen O
to O
those O
who O
are O
guilty O
? O
'' O

There O
were O
also O
two O
criminals O
led O
out O
with O
Jesus O
to O
be O
killed O
. O

They O
were O
led O
to O
a O
place O
called O
`` O
The O
Skull O
. O
'' O

There O
the O
soldiers O
nailed O
Jesus O
to O
the O
cross O
. O

They O
also O
nailed O
the O
criminals O
to O
crosses O
beside O
Jesus O
-- O
one O
on O
the O
right O
and O
the O
other O
on O
the O
left O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Father O
, O
forgive O
them O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
they O
are O
doing O

The O
soldiers O
threw O
dice O
to O
divide O
Jesus O
' O
clothes O
between O
them O
. O

The O
people O
stood O
there O
watching O
everything O
. O

The O
Jewish O
leaders O
laughed O
at O
Jesus O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
If O
he O
is O
God O

Chosen O
One O

the O
Christ O

then O
let O
him O

He O
saved O
others O

did O
n't O
he O
? O
'' O

Even O
the O
soldiers O
laughed O
at O
Jesus O
and O
made O
fun O
of O
him O
. O

They O
came O
and O
offered O
him O
some O
sour O
wine O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
If O
you O
are O
the O
king O
of O
the O
Jews O
, O
save O
yourself O

-LRB- O
At O
the O
top O
of O
the O
cross O
these O
words O
were O
written O
: O
`` O
this O
is O
the O
king O
of O
the O
jews O

-RRB- O

One O
of O
the O
criminals O
hanging O
there O
began O
to O
shout O
insults O
at O
Jesus O
: O
`` O
Are O
n't O
you O
the O
Christ O

Then O
save O
yourself O
, O
and O
save O
us O
too O
! O

But O
the O
other O
criminal O
stopped O
him O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
should O
fear O
God O
. O

All O
of O
us O
will O
die O
soon O

You O
and O
I O
are O
guilty O

We O
deserve O
to O
die O
because O
we O
did O
wrong O

But O
this O
man O
has O
done O
nothing O

Then O
he O
said O
, O
`` O
Jesus O
, O
remember O
me O
when O
you O
begin O
ruling O
as O
king O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
I O
promise O
you O

today O
you O
will O
be O
with O
me O
in O

It O
was O
about O
noon O
, O
but O
it O
turned O
dark O
throughout O
the O
land O
until O
three O
o'clock O
in O
the O
afternoon O
, O
because O
the O
sun O
stopped O
shining O

The O
curtain O
in O
the O
Temple O
was O
torn O
into O
two O
pieces O

Jesus O
shouted O
, O
`` O
Father O

I O
put O
my O
life O

your O
hands O

After O
Jesus O
said O
this O
, O
he O
died O

The O
army O
officer O
there O
saw O
what O
happened O
. O

He O
praised O
God O
, O
saying O
, O
`` O
I O
know O
this O
man O
was O
a O
good O
man O
! O
'' O

Many O
people O
had O
come O
out O
of O
the O
city O
to O
see O
all O
this O
. O

When O
they O
saw O
it O
, O
they O
felt O
very O
sorry O
and O
left O
. O

The O
people O
who O
were O
close O
friends O
of O
Jesus O
were O
there O
. O

Also O
, O
there O
were O
some O
women O
who O
had O
followed O
Jesus O
from O
Galilee O
. O

They O
all O
stood O
far O
away O
from O
the O
cross O
and O
watched O
these O
things O
. O

A O
man O
named O
Joseph O
was O
there O
from O
the O
Jewish O
town O
of O
Arimathea O
. O

He O
was O
a O
good O
man O
, O
who O
lived O
the O
way O
God O
wanted O
. O

He O
was O
waiting O
for O
God O
's O
kingdom O
to O
come O
. O

Joseph O
was O
a O
member O
of O
the O
Jewish O
council O
. O

But O
he O
did O
not O
agree O
when O
the O
other O
Jewish O
leaders O
decided O
to O
kill O
Jesus O
. O

He O
went O
to O
Pilate O
and O
asked O
for O
the O
body O
of O
Jesus O
. O

He O
took O
the O
body O
down O
from O
the O
cross O
and O
wrapped O
it O
in O
cloth O
. O

Then O
he O
put O
it O
in O
a O
tomb O
that O
was O
dug O
in O
a O
wall O
of O
rock O
. O

This O
tomb O
had O
never O
been O
used O
before O
. O

It O
was O
late O
on O
Preparation O
day O
. O

When O
the O
sun O
went O
down O
, O
the O
Sabbath O
day O
would O
begin O
. O

The O
women O
who O
had O
come O
from O
Galilee O
with O
Jesus O
followed O
Joseph O
. O

They O
saw O
the O
tomb O
. O

Inside O
they O
saw O
where O
he O
put O
Jesus O
' O
body O
. O

Then O
they O
left O
to O
prepare O
some O
sweet O
- O
smelling O
spices O
to O
put O
on O
the O
body O
. O

On O
the O
Sabbath O
day O
they O
rested O
, O
as O
commanded O
in O
the O
Law O
of O
Moses O
. O

One O
time O
on O
a O
Sabbath O
day O
, O
Jesus O
was O
walking O
through O
some O
grain O
fields O
. O

His O
followers O
picked O
the O
grain O
, O
rubbed O
it O
in O
their O
hands O
, O
and O
ate O
it O
. O

Some O
Pharisees O
said O
, O
`` O
Why O
are O
you O
doing O
that O
? O

It O
is O
against O
the O
Law O
of O
Moses O
to O
do O
that O
on O
the O
Sabbath O
day O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
You O
have O
read O
about O
what O
David O
did O
when O
he O
and O
the O
people O
with O
him O
were O
hungry O
. O

David O
went O
into O
God O
's O
house O
. O

He O
took O
the O
bread O
that O
was O
offered O
to O
God O
and O
ate O
it O
. O

And O
he O
gave O
some O
of O
the O
bread O
to O
the O
people O
with O
him O
. O

This O
was O
against O
the O
Law O
of O
Moses O
, O
which O
says O
that O
only O
the O
priests O
can O
eat O
that O
bread O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
to O
the O
Pharisees O
, O
`` O
The O
Son O
of O
Man O
is O
Lord O
over O
the O
Sabbath O
day O
. O
'' O

On O
another O
Sabbath O
day O
Jesus O
went O
into O
the O
synagogue O
and O
taught O
the O
people O
. O

A O
man O
with O
a O
crippled O
right O
hand O
was O
there O
. O

The O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
and O
the O
Pharisees O
were O
watching O
Jesus O
closely O
. O

They O
were O
waiting O
to O
see O
if O
he O
would O
heal O
on O
the O
Sabbath O
day O
. O

They O
wanted O
to O
see O
him O
do O
something O
wrong O
so O
that O
they O
could O
accuse O
him O
. O

But O
Jesus O
knew O
what O
they O
were O
thinking O
. O

He O
said O
to O
the O
man O
with O
the O
crippled O
hand O
, O
`` O
Get O
up O
and O
stand O
here O
where O
everyone O
can O
see O
. O
'' O

The O
man O
got O
up O
and O
stood O
there O
. O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
I O
ask O
you O
, O
which O
is O
the O
right O
thing O
to O
do O
on O
the O
Sabbath O
day O
: O
to O
do O
good O
or O
to O
do O
evil O
? O

Is O
it O
right O
to O
save O
a O
life O
or O
to O
destroy O
one O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
looked O
around O
at O
all O
of O
them O
, O
then O
said O
to O
the O
man O
, O
`` O
Hold O
out O
your O
hand O
. O
'' O

The O
man O
held O
out O
his O
hand O
, O
and O
it O
was O
healed O
. O

The O
Pharisees O
and O
the O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
got O
so O
mad O
they O
could O
n't O
think O
straight O
. O

They O
talked O
to O
each O
other O
about O
what O
they O
could O
do O
to O
Jesus O
. O

A O
few O
days O
later O
, O
Jesus O
went O
out O
to O
a O
mountain O
to O
pray O
. O

He O
stayed O
there O
all O
night O
praying O
to O
God O
. O

The O
next O
morning O
he O
called O
his O
followers O
. O

He O
chose O
twelve O
of O
them O
and O
called O
them O
apostles O

These O
are O
the O
ones O
he O
chose O
: O
Simon O

Jesus O

came O
down O
from O

Jesus O

A O

up O

ground O
in O
front O
of O
everyone O
. O

Then O
the O
evil O
spirit O
left O
the O
man O
and O
did O
not O
hurt O
him O
. O

The O
people O
were O
amazed O
. O

They O
said O
to O
each O
other O
, O
`` O
What O
does O
this O
mean O
? O

With O
authority O
and O
power O
he O
commands O
evil O
spirits O
and O
they O
come O
out O
. O
'' O

And O
so O
the O
news O
about O
Jesus O
spread O
to O
every O
place O
in O
the O
whole O
area O
. O

Jesus O
left O
the O
synagogue O
and O
went O
to O
Simon O
's O
house O
. O

Simon O
's O
mother O
- O
in O
- O
law O
was O
very O
sick O
. O

She O
had O
a O
high O
fever O
. O

They O
asked O
Jesus O
to O
do O
something O
to O
help O
her O
. O

He O
stood O
very O
close O
to O
her O
and O
ordered O
the O
sickness O
to O
go O
away O
. O

The O
sickness O
left O
her O
, O
and O
she O
got O
up O
and O
began O
serving O
them O
. O

When O
the O
sun O
went O
down O
, O
the O
people O
brought O
their O
sick O
friends O
to O
Jesus O
. O

They O
had O
many O
different O
kinds O
of O
sicknesses O
. O

Jesus O
laid O
his O
hands O
on O
each O
sick O
person O
and O
healed O
them O
all O
. O

Demons O
came O
out O
of O
many O
people O
. O

The O
demons O
shouted O
, O
`` O
You O
are O
the O
Son O
of O
God O
. O
'' O

But O
Jesus O
gave O
a O
strong O
command O
for O
the O
demons O
not O
to O
speak O
, O
because O
they O
knew O
he O
was O
the O
Christ O
. O

The O
next O
day O
Jesus O
went O
to O
a O
place O
to O
be O
alone O
. O

The O
people O
looked O
for O
him O
. O

When O
they O
found O
him O
, O
they O
tried O
to O
stop O
him O
from O
leaving O
. O

But O
he O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
I O
must O
tell O
the O
Good O
News O
about O
God O
's O
kingdom O
to O
other O
towns O
too O
. O

This O
is O
why O
I O
was O
sent O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
told O
the O
Good O
News O
in O
the O
synagogues O
in O
Judea O
. O

It O
was O
almost O
time O
for O
the O
Jewish O
Festival O
of O
Unleavened O
Bread O
, O
called O
the O
Passover O
. O

The O
leading O
priests O
and O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
wanted O
to O
kill O
Jesus O
. O

But O
they O
were O
trying O
to O
find O
a O
quiet O
way O
to O
do O
it O
, O
because O
they O
were O
afraid O
of O
what O
the O
people O
would O
do O
. O

One O
of O
Jesus O
' O
twelve O
apostles O
was O
named O
Judas O
Iscariot O
. O

Satan O
entered O
him O
, O
and O
he O
went O
and O
talked O
with O
the O
leading O
priests O
and O
some O
of O
the O
soldiers O
who O
guarded O
the O
Temple O
. O

He O
talked O
to O
them O
about O
a O
way O
to O
hand O
Jesus O
over O
to O
them O
. O

The O
priests O
were O
very O
happy O
about O
this O
. O

They O
promised O
to O
give O
Judas O
money O
for O
doing O
this O
. O

He O
agreed O
. O

Then O
he O
waited O
for O
the O
best O
time O
to O
hand O
him O
over O
to O
them O
. O

He O
wanted O
to O
do O
it O
when O
no O
one O
was O
around O
to O
see O
it O
. O

The O
Day O
of O
Unleavened O
Bread O
came O
. O

This O
was O
the O
day O
when O
the O
Jews O
always O
killed O
the O
lambs O
for O
the O
Passover O
. O

Jesus O
said O
to O
Peter O
and O
John O
, O
`` O
Go O
and O
prepare O
the O
Passover O
meal O
for O
us O
to O
eat O
. O
'' O

They O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Where O
do O
you O
want O
us O
to O
prepare O
the O
meal O
? O
'' O

He O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
When O
you O
go O
into O
the O
city O
, O
you O
will O
see O
a O
man O
carrying O
a O
jar O
of O
water O
. O

Follow O
him O
. O

He O
will O
go O
into O
a O
house O
. O

Tell O
the O
owner O
of O
the O
house O
, O
' O
The O
Teacher O
asks O
that O
you O
please O
show O
us O
the O
room O
where O
he O
and O
his O
followers O
can O
eat O
the O
Passover O
meal O
. O
' O

Then O
the O
owner O
will O
show O
you O
a O
large O
room O
upstairs O
that O
is O
ready O
for O
us O
. O

Prepare O
the O
meal O
there O
. O
'' O

So O
Peter O
and O
John O
left O
. O

Everything O
happened O
the O
way O
Jesus O
said O
. O

So O
they O
prepared O
the O
Passover O
meal O
. O

The O
time O
came O
for O
them O
to O
eat O
the O
Passover O
meal O
. O

Jesus O
and O
the O
apostles O
were O
together O
at O
the O
table O
. O

Jesus O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
I O
wanted O
very O
much O
to O
eat O
this O
Passover O
meal O
with O
you O
before O
I O
die O
. O

I O
will O
never O
eat O
another O
Passover O
meal O
until O
it O
is O
given O
its O
full O
meaning O
in O
God O
's O
kingdom O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
took O
a O
cup O
of O
wine O
. O

He O
gave O
thanks O
to O
God O
for O
it O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Take O
this O
cup O
and O
give O
it O
to O
everyone O
here O
. O

I O
will O
never O
drink O
wine O
again O
until O
God O
's O
kingdom O
comes O
. O
'' O

Then O
he O
took O
some O
bread O
and O
thanked O
God O
for O
it O
. O

He O
broke O
off O
some O
pieces O
, O
gave O
them O
to O
the O
apostles O
and O
said O
, O
`` O

This O
bread O
is O
my O
body O
that O
I O
am O
giving O
for O
you O
. O

Eat O
this O
to O
remember O
me O
. O
'' O

In O
the O
same O
way O
, O
after O
supper O
, O
Jesus O
took O
the O
cup O
of O
wine O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
This O
wine O
represents O
the O
new O
agreement O
from O
God O
to O
his O
people O
. O

It O
will O
begin O
when O
my O
blood O
is O
poured O
out O
for O
you O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
But O
here O
on O
this O
table O
is O
the O
hand O
of O
the O
one O
who O
will O
hand O
me O
over O
to O
my O
enemies O
. O

The O
Son O
of O
Man O
will O
do O
what O
God O
has O
planned O
. O

But O
it O
will O
be O
very O
bad O
for O
the O
one O
who O
hands O
over O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O
to O
be O
killed O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
apostles O
asked O
each O
other O
, O
`` O
Which O
one O
of O
us O
would O
do O
that O
? O
'' O

Later O
, O
the O
apostles O
began O
to O
argue O
about O
which O
one O
of O
them O
was O
the O
most O
important O
. O

But O
Jesus O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
The O
kings O
of O
the O
world O
rule O
over O
their O
people O
, O
and O
those O
who O
have O
authority O
over O
others O
want O
to O
be O
called O
' O
the O
great O
providers O
for O
the O
people O
. O
' O

But O
you O
must O
not O
be O
like O
that O
. O

The O
one O
with O
the O
most O
authority O
among O
you O
should O
act O
as O
if O
he O
is O
the O
least O
important O
. O

The O
one O
who O
leads O
should O
be O
like O
one O
who O
serves O
. O

Who O
is O
more O
important O
: O
the O
one O
serving O
or O
the O
one O
sitting O
at O
the O
table O
being O
served O
? O

Everyone O
thinks O
it O
's O
the O
one O
being O
served O
, O
right O
? O

But O
I O
have O
been O
with O
you O
as O
the O
one O
who O
serves O
. O

`` O
You O
men O
have O
stayed O
with O
me O
through O
many O
struggles O
. O

So O
I O
give O
you O
authority O
to O
rule O
with O
me O
in O
the O
kingdom O
the O
Father O
has O
given O
me O
. O

You O
will O
eat O
and O
drink O
at O
my O
table O
in O
that O
kingdom O
. O

You O
will O
sit O
on O
thrones O
and O
judge O
the O
twelve O
tribes O
of O
Israel O
. O

`` O
Satan O
has O
asked O
to O
test O
you O
men O
like O
a O
farmer O
tests O
his O
wheat O
. O
O O

Simon O
, O
Simon O
, O
I O
have O
prayed O
that O
you O
will O
not O
lose O
your O
faith O
! O

Help O
your O
brothers O
be O
stronger O
when O
you O
come O
back O
to O
me O
. O
'' O

But O
Peter O
said O
to O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
I O
am O
ready O
to O
go O
to O
jail O
with O
you O
. O

I O
will O
even O
die O
with O
you O
! O
'' O

But O
Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Peter O
, O
before O
the O
rooster O
crows O
tomorrow O
morning O
, O
you O
will O
say O
you O
do O
n't O
know O
me O
. O

You O
will O
say O
this O
three O
times O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
to O
the O
apostles O
, O
`` O
Remember O
when O
I O
sent O
you O
out O
without O
money O
, O
a O
bag O
, O
or O
sandals O
? O

Did O
you O
need O
anything O
? O
'' O

The O
apostles O
said O
, O
`` O
No O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
But O
now O
if O
you O
have O
money O
or O
a O
bag O
, O
carry O
that O
with O
you O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
sword O
, O
sell O
your O
coat O
and O
buy O
one O
. O

The O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
' O
He O
was O
considered O
a O
criminal O
. O
' O

This O
Scripture O
must O
happen O
. O

It O
was O
written O
about O
me O
, O
and O
it O
is O
happening O
now O
. O
'' O

The O
followers O
said O
, O
`` O
Look O
, O
Lord O
, O
here O
are O
two O
swords O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
That O
's O
enough O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
left O
the O
city O
and O
went O
to O
the O
Mount O
of O
Olives O
. O

His O
followers O
went O
with O
him O
. O

-LRB- O
He O
went O
there O
often O
. O
-RRB- O

He O
said O
to O
his O
followers O
, O
`` O
Pray O
for O
strength O
against O
temptation O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
went O
about O
50 O
steps O
away O
from O
them O
. O

He O
knelt O
down O
and O
prayed O
, O
`` O
Father O
, O
if O
you O
are O
willing O
, O
please O
do O
n't O
make O
me O
drink O
from O
this O
cup O
. O

But O
do O
what O
you O
want O
, O
not O
what O
I O
want O
. O
'' O

Then O
an O
angel O
from O
heaven O
came O
to O
help O
him O
. O

Jesus O
was O
full O
of O
pain O
; O
he O
struggled O
hard O
in O
prayer O
. O

Sweat O
dripped O
from O
his O
face O
like O
drops O
of O
blood O
falling O
to O
the O
ground O
. O

When O
he O
finished O
praying O
, O
he O
went O
to O
his O
followers O
. O

He O
found O
them O
asleep O
, O
worn O
out O
from O
their O
grieving O
. O

Jesus O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Why O
are O
you O
sleeping O
? O

Get O
up O
and O
pray O
for O
strength O
against O
temptation O
. O
'' O

While O
Jesus O
was O
speaking O
, O
a O
crowd O
came O
up O
. O

It O
was O
led O
by O
Judas O
, O
one O
of O
the O
twelve O
apostles O
. O

He O
came O
over O
to O
Jesus O
to O
kiss O
him O
. O

But O
Jesus O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Judas O
, O
are O
you O
using O
the O
kiss O
of O
friendship O
to O
hand O
over O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O
to O
his O
enemies O
? O
'' O

The O
followers O
of O
Jesus O
were O
standing O
there O
too O
. O

They O
saw O
what O
was O
happening O
and O
said O
to O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
should O
we O
use O
our O
swords O
? O
'' O

And O
one O
of O
them O
did O
use O
his O
sword O
. O

He O
cut O
off O
the O
right O
ear O
of O
the O
servant O
of O
the O
high O
priest O
. O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Stop O
! O
'' O

Then O
he O
touched O
the O
servant O
's O
ear O
and O
healed O
him O
. O

Jesus O
spoke O
to O
the O
group O
that O
came O
to O
arrest O
him O
. O

They O
were O
the O
leading O
priests O
, O
the O
older O
Jewish O
leaders O
, O
and O
the O
Jewish O
soldiers O
. O

He O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Why O
did O
you O
come O
out O
here O
with O
swords O
and O
clubs O
? O

Do O
you O
think O
I O
am O
a O
criminal O
? O

I O
was O
with O
you O
every O
day O
in O
the O
Temple O
area O
. O

Why O
did O
n't O
you O
try O
to O
arrest O
me O
there O
? O

But O
this O
is O
your O
time O
-- O
the O
time O
when O
darkness O
rules O
. O
'' O

They O
arrested O
Jesus O
and O
took O
him O
away O
to O
the O
house O
of O
the O
high O
priest O
. O

Peter O
followed O
Jesus O
but O
stayed O
back O
at O
a O
distance O
. O

The O
soldiers O
started O
a O
fire O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
yard O
and O
sat O
together O
. O

Peter O
sat O
with O
them O
. O

A O
servant O
girl O
saw O
him O
sitting O
there O
. O

She O
could O
see O
because O
of O
the O
light O
from O
the O
fire O
. O

She O
looked O
closely O
at O
Peter O
's O
face O
. O

Then O
she O
said O
, O
`` O
This O
man O
was O
also O
with O
Jesus O
. O
'' O

But O
Peter O
said O
this O
was O
not O
true O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Lady O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
him O
. O
'' O

A O
short O
time O
later O
, O
someone O
else O
saw O
Peter O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
are O
also O
one O
of O
them O
. O
'' O

But O
Peter O
said O
, O
`` O
Man O
, O
I O
am O
not O
! O
'' O

About O
an O
hour O
later O
, O
another O
man O
said O
, O
`` O
It O
's O
true O
. O

I O
'm O
sure O
this O
man O
was O
with O
him O
, O
because O
he O
is O
from O
Galilee O
. O
'' O

But O
Peter O
said O
, O
`` O
Man O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
you O
are O
talking O
about O
! O
'' O

Immediately O
, O
while O
he O
was O
still O
speaking O
, O
a O
rooster O
crowed O
. O

Then O
the O
Lord O
turned O
and O
looked O
into O
Peter O
's O
eyes O
. O

And O
Peter O
remembered O
what O
the O
Lord O
had O
said O
, O
`` O
Before O
the O
rooster O
crows O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
you O
will O
say O
three O
times O
that O
you O
do O
n't O
know O
me O
. O
'' O

Then O
Peter O
went O
outside O
and O
cried O
bitterly O
. O

The O
men O
guarding O
Jesus O
made O
fun O
of O
him O
and O
beat O
him O
. O

They O
covered O
his O
eyes O
so O
that O
he O
could O
not O
see O
them O
. O

Then O
they O
hit O
him O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Be O
a O
prophet O
and O
tell O
us O
who O
hit O
you O
! O
'' O

And O
they O
shouted O
all O
kinds O
of O
insults O
at O
him O
. O

The O
next O
morning O
, O
the O
older O
leaders O
of O
the O
people O
, O
the O
leading O
priests O
, O
and O
the O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
came O
together O
. O

They O
led O
Jesus O
away O
to O
their O
high O
council O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
If O
you O
are O
the O
Christ O
, O
then O
tell O
us O
that O
you O
are O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
If O
I O
tell O
you O
I O
am O
the O
Christ O
, O
you O
will O
not O
believe O
me O

if O
I O
ask O
you O
, O
you O
will O
not O
answer O
. O

But O
beginning O
now O
, O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O
will O
sit O
at O
the O
right O
side O
of O
God O
All O
- O
Powerful O
. O
'' O

They O
all O
said O
, O
`` O
Then O
are O
you O
the O
Son O
of O
God O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
You O
are O
right O
in O
saying O
that O
I O
am O
. O
'' O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Why O
do O
we O
need O
witnesses O
now O
? O

We O
all O
heard O
what O
he O
said O
! O
'' O

On O
a O
Sabbath O
day O
, O
Jesus O
went O
to O
the O
home O
of O
a O
leading O
Pharisee O
to O
eat O
with O
him O
. O

The O
people O
there O
were O
all O
watching O
him O
very O
closely O
. O

A O
man O
with O
a O
bad O
disease O
was O
there O
in O
front O
of O
him O
. O

Jesus O
said O
to O
the O
Pharisees O
and O
experts O
in O
the O
law O
, O
`` O
Is O
it O
right O
or O
wrong O
to O
heal O
on O
the O
Sabbath O
day O
? O
'' O

But O
they O
would O
not O
answer O
his O
question O
. O

So O
he O
took O
the O
man O
and O
healed O
him O
. O

Then O
he O
sent O
the O
man O
away O
. O

Jesus O
said O
to O
the O
Pharisees O
and O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
, O
`` O
If O
your O
son O
or O
work O
animal O
falls O
into O
a O
well O
on O
the O
Sabbath O
day O
, O
you O
know O
you O
would O
pull O
him O
out O
immediately O
. O
'' O

The O
Pharisees O
and O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
could O
say O
nothing O
against O
what O
he O
said O
. O

Then O
Jesus O
noticed O
that O
some O
of O
the O
guests O
were O
choosing O
the O
best O
places O
to O
sit O
. O

So O
he O
told O
this O
story O
: O
`` O
When O
someone O
invites O
you O
to O
a O
wedding O
, O
do O
n't O
sit O
in O
the O
most O
important O
seat O
. O

They O
may O
have O
invited O
someone O
more O
important O
than O
you O
. O

And O
if O
you O
are O
sitting O
in O
the O
most O
important O
seat O
, O
they O
will O
come O
to O
you O
and O
say O
, O
' O
Give O
this O
man O
your O
seat O
! O
' O

Then O
you O
will O
have O
to O
move O
down O
to O
the O
last O
place O
and O
be O
embarrassed O
. O

`` O
So O
when O
someone O
invites O
you O
, O
go O
sit O
in O
the O
seat O
that O
is O
not O
important O
. O

Then O
they O
will O
come O
to O
you O
and O
say O
, O
' O
Friend O
, O
move O
up O
here O
to O
this O
better O
place O
! O
' O

What O
an O
honor O
this O
will O
be O
for O
you O
in O
front O
of O
all O
the O
other O
guests O
. O

Everyone O
who O
makes O
themselves O
important O
will O
be O
made O
humble O
. O

But O
everyone O
who O
makes O
themselves O
humble O
will O
be O
made O
important O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
to O
the O
Pharisee O
who O
had O
invited O
him O
, O
`` O
When O
you O
give O
a O
lunch O
or O
a O
dinner O
, O
do O
n't O
invite O
only O
your O
friends O
, O
brothers O
, O
relatives O
, O
and O
rich O
neighbors O
. O

At O
another O
time O
they O
will O
pay O
you O
back O
by O
inviting O
you O
to O
eat O
with O
them O
. O

Instead O
, O
when O
you O
give O
a O
feast O
, O
invite O
the O
poor O
, O
the O
crippled O
, O
and O
the O
blind O
. O

Then O
you O
will O
have O
great O
blessings O
, O
because O
these O
people O
can O
not O
pay O
you O
back O
. O

They O
have O
nothing O
. O

But O
God O
will O
reward O
you O
at O
the O
time O
when O
all O
godly O
people O
rise O
from O
death O

'' O

One O
of O
the O
men O
sitting O
at O
the O
table O
with O
Jesus O
heard O
these O
things O

The O
man O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
It O

Jesus O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
A O

gave O
a O
big O
dinner O

He O
invited O
many O

When O
it O

he O
sent O
his O

But O
all O

said O
they O
could O

Each O
one O
made O
an O

The O
first O
one O

`` O
So O
the O

returned O

told O

The O

was O

He O
said O

Then O
Jesus O
said O

`` O

I O
tell O

But O
he O
will O
surely O
get O
up O

So O
I O
tell O
you O

continue O

God O

Continue O

Whoever O

whoever O

Do O
any O

you O

What O
would O
you O
do O
if O
your O

you O
for O

Would O
any O

Even O
you O

So O
surely O
your O
heavenly O
Father O
knows O
how O

the O
Holy O
Spirit O

ask O

One O
time O
Jesus O
was O
sending O

could O
not O

When O
the O
demon O
came O
out O

the O
man O
was O
able O
to O

The O
crowds O
were O
amazed O

But O
some O
of O
the O
people O
said O
, O
`` O
He O
uses O
the O
power O

Satan O

ruler O

Some O
others O
there O
wanted O
to O
test O
Jesus O

They O
asked O
him O
to O
do O
a O
miracle O
as O
a O
sign O
from O
God O
. O

But O
he O
knew O
what O
they O
were O
thinking O

So O
he O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Every O
kingdom O
that O

itself O
will O
be O
destroyed O

And O
a O

that O

break O

So O
if O
Satan O
is O
fighting O
against O
himself O
, O
how O
will O
his O
kingdom O
survive O
? O

You O
say O
that O
I O
use O
the O
power O
of O
Satan O

force O
out O

But O
if O
I O
use O
Satan O

power O

force O
out O
demons O
, O
then O
what O
power O
do O
your O
people O
use O
when O
they O
force O
out O
demons O
? O

So O
your O
own O
people O
will O
prove O
that O
you O
are O
wrong O
. O

But O
I O
use O
the O
power O
of O
God O
to O
force O
out O
demons O

This O
shows O
that O
God O

kingdom O
has O
come O

`` O
When O

But O
suppose O
a O
stronger O
man O
comes O

him O

The O
stronger O
man O
will O
take O
away O
the O
weapons O
that O
the O
first O
man O
trusted O
to O

Then O
the O
stronger O

do O
what O

`` O

When O

it O

it O

When O

it O
finds O

the O
evil O
spirit O
goes O
out O

brings O
back O
seven O

more O
evil O

all O

more O

that O
happened O
to O
Jonah O
. O

Jonah O
was O
a O
sign O
for O
those O
who O
lived O
in O
Nineveh O
. O

It O
is O
the O
same O
with O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O
. O

He O
will O
be O
a O
sign O
for O
the O
people O
of O
this O
time O

`` O
On O
the O
judgment O
day O
, O
you O
people O
who O
live O
now O
will O
be O
compared O
with O
the O
Queen O
of O
the O
South O
, O
and O
she O
will O
be O
a O
witness O
who O
shows O
how O
guilty O
you O
are O
. O

Why O
do O
I O
say O
this O
? O

Because O
she O
traveled O
from O
far O
, O
far O
away O
to O
listen O
to O
Solomon O
's O
wise O
teaching O
. O

And O
I O
tell O
you O
that O
someone O
greater O
than O
Solomon O
is O
right O
here O
, O
but O
you O
wo O
n't O
listen O
! O

`` O
On O
the O
judgment O
day O
, O
you O
people O
who O
live O
now O
will O
also O
be O
compared O

people O
from O
Nineveh O

and O
they O
will O
be O
witnesses O
who O
show O
how O
guilty O
you O
are O

I O
say O
this O
because O
when O
Jonah O
preached O
to O
those O
people O
, O
they O
changed O
their O
hearts O
and O
lives O
. O

And O
you O
are O
listening O
to O
someone O
greater O
than O
Jonah O
, O
but O
you O
refuse O
to O
change O

`` O
No O
one O
takes O
a O
light O
and O
puts O
it O
under O
a O
bowl O
or O
hides O
it O

Instead O
, O
they O
put O
it O
on O
a O
lampstand O
so O
that O
the O
people O
who O
come O
in O
can O
see O
. O

The O
only O
source O
of O
light O
for O
the O
body O
is O
the O
eye O

When O
you O
look O
at O
people O
and O
want O
to O
help O
them O
, O
you O
are O
full O
of O
light O

But O
when O
you O
look O
at O
people O
in O
a O
selfish O
way O
, O
you O
are O
full O

darkness O

So O
be O
careful O

Do O
n't O
let O
the O

there O
is O
no O

then O
you O

After O
Jesus O
had O
finished O
speaking O
, O
a O
Pharisee O
asked O
Jesus O
to O
eat O
with O
him O
. O

So O
he O
went O
and O
took O
a O
place O
at O
the O
table O
. O

But O
the O
Pharisee O
was O
surprised O
when O
he O
saw O
that O
Jesus O
did O
not O
wash O
his O
hands O
first O
before O
the O
meal O
. O

The O
Lord O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
The O
washing O
you O
Pharisees O
do O
is O
like O
cleaning O
only O
the O
outside O
of O
a O
cup O
or O
a O
dish O
. O

But O
what O
is O
inside O
you O
? O

You O
want O
only O
to O
cheat O
and O
hurt O
people O
. O

You O
are O
foolish O
! O

The O
same O
one O
who O
made O
what O
is O
outside O
also O
made O
what O
is O
inside O
. O

So O
pay O
attention O
to O
what O
is O
inside O
. O

Give O
to O
the O
people O
who O
need O
help O
. O

Then O
you O
will O
be O
fully O
clean O

`` O
But O
it O
will O
be O
bad O
for O
you O

You O
give O
God O
a O

you O

One O

When O
Jesus O
went O
out O
, O
the O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
and O
the O
Pharisees O
began O
to O
give O
him O
much O
trouble O

They O
tried O
to O
make O
him O
answer O
questions O
about O
many O
things O

They O
were O
trying O
to O
find O
a O
way O
to O
catch O
Jesus O
saying O
something O
wrong O
. O

Jesus O
finished O
saying O
all O
these O
things O
to O
the O
people O
. O

Then O
he O
went O
into O
Capernaum O
. O

In O
Capernaum O
there O
was O
an O
army O
officer O
. O

He O
had O
a O
servant O
who O
was O
very O
sick O
; O
he O
was O
near O
death O

The O
officer O
loved O
the O
servant O
very O
much O
. O

When O
he O
heard O
about O
Jesus O
, O
he O
sent O
some O
older O
Jewish O
leaders O
to O
him O
. O

He O
wanted O
the O
men O
to O
ask O
Jesus O
to O
come O
and O
save O
the O
life O
of O
his O
servant O

The O
men O
went O
to O
Jesus O
. O

They O
begged O
Jesus O
to O
help O
the O
officer O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
This O
officer O

worthy O

He O
loves O
our O
people O

the O
synagogue O

So O
Jesus O
went O
with O
them O
. O

He O
was O
coming O
near O
the O
officer O

house O
when O
the O
officer O
sent O
friends O
to O
say O

`` O

not O
good O
enough O

That O
is O
why O
I O
did O
not O
come O

you O

You O
need O
only O
to O
give O
the O
order O

and O
my O
servant O

I O
know O
this O

I O

I O

When O
Jesus O
heard O
this O
, O
he O
was O
amazed O

He O
turned O
to O
the O
people O
following O
him O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
tell O
you O

the O

The O
group O
that O
was O
sent O
to O
Jesus O
went O
back O
to O
the O
house O

There O
they O
found O
that O
the O
servant O
was O
healed O

The O
next O
day O
Jesus O
and O
his O
followers O
went O
to O
a O
town O
called O
Nain O
. O

A O
big O
crowd O
was O
traveling O
with O
them O
. O

When O
Jesus O
came O
near O
the O
town O
gate O
, O
he O
saw O
some O
people O
carrying O
a O
dead O
body O
. O

It O
was O
the O
only O
son O
of O
a O
woman O
who O
was O
a O
widow O

Walking O
with O
her O
were O
many O
other O
people O
from O
the O
town O

When O
the O
Lord O
saw O
the O
woman O
, O
he O
felt O
very O
sorry O
for O
her O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
cry O

He O
walked O
to O
the O
open O
coffin O
and O
touched O
it O
. O

The O
men O
who O
were O
carrying O
the O
coffin O
stopped O

Jesus O
spoke O
to O
the O
dead O
son O
: O
`` O
Young O
man O
, O
I O
tell O
you O
, O
get O
up O
! O
'' O

Then O
the O
boy O
sat O
up O
and O
began O
to O
talk O
, O
and O
Jesus O
gave O
him O
back O
to O
his O
mother O
. O

Everyone O
was O
filled O
with O
fear O

They O
began O
praising O
God O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
A O
great O

here O
with O
us O

'' O

and O
`` O
God O
is O
taking O
care O
of O
his O
people O

This O
news O
about O
Jesus O
spread O
all O
over O
Judea O
and O
to O
all O
the O
other O
places O
around O
there O
. O

John O
's O
followers O
told O
him O
about O
all O
these O
things O
. O

John O
called O
for O
two O
of O
his O
followers O
. O

He O
sent O
them O
to O
the O
Lord O
to O
ask O
, O
`` O
Are O
you O
the O
one O
we O
heard O
was O
coming O

should O

wait O

So O
the O
men O
came O
to O
Jesus O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
John O
the O
Baptizer O

Right O
then O
Jesus O
healed O
many O
people O

their O
sicknesses O

diseases O

He O
healed O
those O
who O
had O
evil O
spirits O

made O
many O
who O

blind O
able O

again O

Good O

When O
John O

followers O
left O

Jesus O
began O
talking O
to O
the O
people O
about O
John O
: O
`` O

out O
into O

out O

a O
prophet O

tell O

is O
more O
than O

greater O

least O
important O

greater O

the O
people O

all O

the O

house O
. O

So O
the O
woman O
brought O
some O
expensive O
perfume O
in O
an O
alabaster O
jar O
. O

She O
stood O
at O
Jesus O
' O
feet O
, O
crying O
. O

Then O
she O
began O
to O
wash O
his O
feet O
with O
her O
tears O
. O

She O
dried O
his O
feet O
with O
her O
hair O
. O

She O
kissed O
his O
feet O
many O
times O
and O
rubbed O
them O
with O
the O
perfume O
. O

When O
the O
Pharisee O
who O
asked O
Jesus O
to O
come O
to O
his O
house O
saw O
this O
, O
he O
thought O
to O
himself O
, O
`` O
If O
this O
man O
were O
a O
prophet O
, O
he O
would O
know O
that O
the O
woman O
who O
is O
touching O
him O
is O
a O
sinner O
! O
'' O

In O
response O
, O
Jesus O
said O
to O
the O
Pharisee O
, O
`` O
Simon O
, O
I O
have O
something O
to O
say O
to O
you O
. O
'' O

Simon O
said O
, O
`` O
Let O
me O
hear O
it O
, O
Teacher O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
There O
were O
two O
men O
. O

Both O
men O
owed O
money O
to O
the O
same O
banker O
. O

One O
man O
owed O
him O
500 O
silver O
coins O
. O

The O
other O
man O
owed O
him O
50 O
silver O
coins O
. O

The O
men O
had O
no O
money O
, O
so O
they O
could O
not O
pay O
their O
debt O
. O

But O
the O
banker O
told O
the O
men O
that O
they O
did O
not O
have O
to O
pay O
him O
. O

Which O
one O
of O
those O
two O
men O
will O
love O
him O
more O
? O
'' O

Simon O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
the O
one O
who O
owed O
him O
the O
most O
money O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
You O
are O
right O
. O
'' O

Then O
he O
turned O
to O
the O
woman O
and O
said O
to O
Simon O
, O
`` O
Do O
you O
see O
this O
woman O
? O

When O
I O
came O
into O
your O
house O
, O
you O
gave O
me O
no O
water O
for O
my O
feet O
. O

But O
she O
washed O
my O
feet O
with O
her O
tears O
and O
dried O
my O
feet O
with O
her O
hair O
. O

You O
did O
not O
greet O
me O
with O
a O
kiss O
, O
but O
she O
has O
been O
kissing O
my O
feet O
since O
I O
came O
in O
. O

You O
did O
not O
honor O
me O
with O
oil O
for O
my O
head O
, O
but O
she O
rubbed O
my O
feet O
with O
her O
sweet O
- O
smelling O
oil O
. O

I O
tell O
you O
that O
her O
many O
sins O
are O
forgiven O
. O

This O
is O
clear O
, O
because O
she O
showed O
great O
love O
. O

People O
who O
are O
forgiven O
only O
a O
little O
will O
love O
only O
a O
little O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
to O
her O
, O
`` O
Your O
sins O
are O
forgiven O
. O
'' O

The O
people O
sitting O
at O
the O
table O
began O
to O
think O
to O
themselves O
, O
`` O
Who O
does O
this O
man O
think O
he O
is O
? O

How O
can O
he O
forgive O
sins O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
to O
the O
woman O
, O
`` O
Because O
you O
believed O
, O
you O
are O
saved O
from O
your O
sins O
. O

Go O
in O
peace O
. O
'' O

The O
next O
day O
, O
Jesus O
traveled O
through O
some O
cities O
and O
small O
towns O
. O

Jesus O
told O
the O
people O
a O
message O
from O
God O
, O
the O
Good O
News O
about O
God O
's O
kingdom O
. O

The O
twelve O
apostles O
were O
with O
him O
. O

There O
were O
also O
some O
women O
with O
him O
. O

Jesus O
had O
healed O
these O
women O
of O
sicknesses O
and O
evil O
spirits O
. O

One O
of O
them O
was O
Mary O
, O
who O
was O
called O
Magdalene O
. O

Seven O
demons O
had O
come O
out O
of O
her O
. O

Also O
with O
these O
women O
were O
Joanna O
, O
the O
wife O
of O
Chuza O
-LRB- O
the O
manager O
of O
Herod O
's O
property O
-RRB- O
, O
Suzanna O
, O
and O
many O
other O
women O
. O

These O
women O
used O
their O
own O
money O
to O
help O
Jesus O
and O
his O
apostles O
. O

A O
large O
crowd O
came O
together O
. O

People O
came O
to O
Jesus O
from O
every O
town O
, O
and O
he O
told O
them O
this O
story O
: O

`` O
A O
farmer O
went O
out O
to O
sow O
seed O
. O

While O
he O
was O
scattering O
the O
seed O
, O
some O
of O
it O
fell O
beside O
the O
road O
. O

People O
walked O
on O
the O
seed O
, O
and O
the O
birds O
ate O
it O
all O
. O

Other O
seed O
fell O
on O
rock O
. O

It O
began O
to O
grow O
but O
then O
died O
because O
it O
had O
no O
water O
. O

Some O
other O
seed O
fell O
among O
thorny O
weeds O
. O

This O
seed O
grew O
, O
but O
later O
the O
weeds O
stopped O
the O
plants O
from O
growing O
. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
seed O
fell O
on O
good O
ground O
. O

This O
seed O
grew O
and O
made O
100 O
times O
more O
grain O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
finished O
the O
story O
. O

Then O
he O
called O
out O
, O
`` O
You O
people O
who O
hear O
me O
, O
listen O
! O
'' O

Jesus O
' O
followers O
asked O
him O
, O
`` O
What O
does O
this O
story O
mean O
? O
'' O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
have O
been O
chosen O
to O
know O
the O
secret O
truths O
about O
God O
's O
kingdom O
. O

But O
I O
use O
stories O
to O
speak O
to O
other O
people O
. O

I O
do O
this O
so O
that O
, O
' O
They O
will O
look O
, O
but O
they O
will O
not O
see O
, O
and O
they O
will O
listen O
, O
but O
they O
will O
not O
understand O
. O
' O

`` O
This O
is O
what O
the O
story O
means O
: O
The O
seed O
is O
God O
's O
teaching O
. O

Some O
people O
are O
like O
the O
seed O
that O
fell O
beside O
the O
path O
. O

They O
hear O
God O
's O
teaching O
, O
but O
then O
the O
devil O
comes O
and O
causes O
them O
to O
stop O
thinking O
about O
it O
. O

This O
keeps O
them O
from O
believing O
it O
and O
being O
saved O
. O

Others O
are O
like O
the O
seed O
that O
fell O
on O
rock O
. O

That O
is O
like O
the O
people O
who O
hear O
God O
's O
teaching O
and O
gladly O
accept O
it O
. O

But O
they O
do O
n't O
have O
deep O
roots O
. O

They O
believe O
for O
a O
while O
. O

But O
when O
trouble O
comes O
, O
they O
turn O
away O
from O
God O
. O

`` O
What O
about O
the O
seed O
that O
fell O
among O
the O
thorny O
weeds O
? O

That O
is O
like O
the O
people O
who O
hear O
God O
's O
teaching O
, O
but O
they O
let O
the O
worries O
, O
riches O
, O
and O
pleasures O
of O
this O
life O
stop O
them O
from O
growing O
. O

So O
they O
never O
produce O
a O
crop O
. O

And O
what O
about O
the O
seed O
that O
fell O
on O
the O
good O
ground O
? O

That O
is O
like O
the O
people O
who O
hear O
God O
's O
teaching O
with O
a O
good O
, O
honest O
heart O
. O

They O
obey O
it O
and O
patiently O
produce O
a O
good O
crop O
. O

`` O
No O
one O
lights O
a O
lamp O
and O
then O
covers O
it O
with O
a O
bowl O
or O
hides O
it O
under O
a O
bed O
. O

Instead O
, O
they O
put O
the O
lamp O
on O
a O
lampstand O
so O
that O
the O
people O
who O
come O
in O
will O
have O
enough O
light O
to O
see O
. O

Everything O
that O
is O
hidden O
will O
become O
clear O
. O

Every O
secret O
thing O
will O
be O
made O
known O
, O
and O
everyone O
will O
see O
it O
. O

So O
think O
carefully O
about O
what O
you O
are O
hearing O
. O

The O
people O
who O
have O
some O
understanding O
will O
receive O
more O
. O

But O
those O
who O
do O
not O
have O
understanding O
will O
lose O
even O
what O
they O
think O
they O
have O

'' O

Jesus O
' O
mother O
and O
brothers O
came O
to O
visit O
him O
. O

But O
they O
could O
not O
get O
close O
to O
him O
, O
because O
there O
were O
so O
many O
people O

Someone O
said O
to O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
Your O
mother O

your O
brothers O
are O
standing O
outside O

They O
want O
to O
see O
you O

Jesus O
answered O
them O
, O
`` O
My O

my O

are O
those O
who O
listen O
to O
God O

One O
day O
Jesus O
and O
his O
followers O
got O
into O
a O
boat O
. O

He O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Come O
with O
me O
across O
the O
lake O

'' O

And O
so O
they O
started O
across O
. O

While O
they O
were O
sailing O
, O
Jesus O
slept O
. O

A O
big O
storm O
blew O
across O
the O
lake O
, O
and O
the O
boat O
began O
to O
fill O
with O
water O
. O

They O
were O
in O
danger O
. O

The O
followers O
went O
to O
Jesus O
and O
woke O
him O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Master O
! O

Master O
! O

We O
will O
drown O
! O
'' O

Jesus O
got O
up O
. O

He O
gave O
a O
command O
to O
the O
wind O
and O
the O
waves O
. O

The O
wind O
stopped O
, O
and O
the O
lake O
became O
calm O
. O

He O
said O
to O
his O
followers O
, O
`` O
Where O
is O
your O
faith O
? O
'' O

They O
were O
afraid O
and O
amazed O
. O

They O
said O
to O
each O
other O
, O
`` O
What O
kind O
of O
man O
is O
this O
? O

He O
commands O
the O
wind O
and O
the O
water O
, O
and O
they O
obey O
him O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
and O
his O
followers O
sailed O
on O
across O
the O
lake O
. O

They O
sailed O
to O
the O
area O
where O
the O
Gerasene O
people O
live O
, O
across O
from O
Galilee O
. O

When O
Jesus O
got O
out O
of O
the O
boat O
, O
a O
man O
from O
that O
town O
came O
to O
him O
. O

This O
man O
had O
demons O
inside O
him O
. O

For O
a O
long O
time O
he O
had O
worn O
no O
clothes O
. O

He O
did O
not O
live O
in O
a O
house O
but O
in O
the O
caves O
where O
the O
dead O
are O
buried O
. O

The O
demon O
inside O
the O
man O
had O
often O
seized O
him O
, O
and O
he O
had O
been O
put O
in O
jail O
with O
his O
hands O
and O
feet O
in O
chains O
. O

But O
he O
would O
always O
break O
the O
chains O
. O

The O
demon O
inside O
him O
would O
force O
him O
to O
go O
out O
to O
the O
places O
where O
no O
one O
lived O
. O

Jesus O
commanded O
the O
evil O
spirit O
to O
come O
out O
of O
the O
man O
. O

When O
the O
man O
saw O
Jesus O
, O
he O
fell O
down O
before O
him O
, O
shouting O
loudly O
, O
`` O
What O
do O
you O
want O
with O
me O
, O
Jesus O
, O
Son O
of O
the O
Most O
High O
God O
? O

Please O
, O
do O
n't O
punish O
me O
! O
'' O

Jesus O
asked O
him O
, O
`` O
What O
is O
your O
name O
? O
'' O

The O
man O
answered O
, O
`` O
Legion O
. O
'' O

-LRB- O
He O
said O
his O
name O
was O
`` O
Legion O
'' O
because O
many O
demons O
had O
gone O
into O
him O
. O
-RRB- O

The O
demons O
begged O
Jesus O
not O
to O
send O
them O
into O
the O
bottomless O
pit O
. O

On O
that O
hill O
there O
was O
a O
big O
herd O
of O
pigs O
eating O
. O

The O
demons O
begged O
Jesus O
to O
allow O
them O
to O
go O
into O
the O
pigs O
. O

So O
he O
allowed O
them O
to O
do O
this O
. O

Then O
the O
demons O
came O
out O
of O
the O
man O
and O
went O
into O
the O
pigs O
. O

The O
herd O
of O
pigs O
ran O
down O
the O
hill O
into O
the O
lake O
, O
and O
all O
were O
drowned O
. O

The O
men O
who O
were O
caring O
for O
the O
pigs O
ran O
away O
and O
told O
the O
story O
in O
the O
fields O
and O
in O
the O
town O
. O

People O
went O
out O
to O
see O
what O
had O
happened O
. O

They O
came O
to O
Jesus O
and O
found O
the O
man O
sitting O
there O
at O
the O
feet O
of O
Jesus O
. O

The O
man O
had O
clothes O
on O
and O
was O
in O
his O
right O
mind O
again O
; O
the O
demons O
were O
gone O
. O

This O
made O
the O
people O
afraid O
. O

The O
men O
who O
saw O
these O
things O
happen O
told O
the O
others O
all O
about O
how O
Jesus O
made O
the O
man O
well O
. O

All O
those O
who O
lived O
in O
the O
area O
around O
Gerasa O
asked O
Jesus O
to O
go O
away O
because O
they O
were O
afraid O
. O

So O
Jesus O
got O
into O
the O
boat O
to O
go O
back O
to O
Galilee O
. O

The O
man O
he O
had O
healed O
begged O
to O
go O
with O
him O
. O

But O
Jesus O
sent O
him O
away O
, O
saying O
, O
`` O
Go O
back O
home O
and O
tell O
people O
what O
God O
did O
for O
you O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
man O
went O
all O
over O
town O
telling O
what O
Jesus O
had O
done O
for O
him O
. O

When O
Jesus O
went O
back O
to O
Galilee O
, O
the O
people O
welcomed O
him O
. O

Everyone O
was O
waiting O
for O
him O
. O

A O
man O
named O
Jairus O
came O
to O
him O
. O

He O
was O
a O
leader O
of O
the O
synagogue O
. O

He O
had O
only O
one O
daughter O
. O

She O
was O
twelve O
years O
old O
, O
and O
she O
was O
dying O
. O

So O
Jairus O
bowed O
down O
at O
the O
feet O
of O
Jesus O
and O
begged O
him O
to O
come O
to O
his O
house O
. O

While O
Jesus O
was O
going O
to O
Jairus O
' O
house O
, O
the O
people O
crowded O
all O
around O
him O
. O

A O
woman O
was O
there O
who O
had O
been O
bleeding O
for O
twelve O
years O
. O

She O
had O
spent O
all O
her O
money O
on O
doctors O
, O
but O
no O
doctor O
was O
able O
to O
heal O
her O
. O

The O
woman O
came O
behind O
Jesus O
and O
touched O
the O
bottom O
of O
his O
coat O
. O

At O
that O
moment O
, O
her O
bleeding O
stopped O
. O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Who O
touched O
me O
? O
'' O

They O
all O
said O
they O
had O
not O
touched O
him O
. O

And O
Peter O
said O
, O
`` O
Master O
, O
people O
are O
all O
around O
you O
, O
pushing O
against O
you O
. O
'' O

But O
Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Someone O
touched O
me O
. O

I O
felt O
power O
go O
out O
from O
me O
. O
'' O

When O
the O
woman O
saw O
that O
she O
could O
not O
hide O
, O
she O
came O
forward O
, O
shaking O
. O

She O
bowed O
down O
before O
Jesus O
. O

While O
everyone O
listened O
, O
she O
told O
why O
she O
touched O
him O
. O

Then O
she O
said O
that O
she O
was O
healed O
immediately O
when O
she O
touched O
him O
. O

Jesus O
said O
to O
her O
, O
`` O
My O
daughter O
, O
you O
are O
made O
well O
because O
you O
believed O
. O

Go O
in O
peace O
. O
'' O

While O
Jesus O
was O
still O
speaking O
, O
someone O
came O
from O
the O
house O
of O
the O
synagogue O
leader O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Your O
daughter O
has O
died O
! O

Do O
n't O
bother O
the O
Teacher O
anymore O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
heard O
this O
and O
said O
to O
Jairus O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
be O
afraid O
! O

Just O
believe O
and O
your O
daughter O
will O
be O
well O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
went O
to O
the O
house O
. O

He O
let O
only O
Peter O
, O
John O
, O
James O
, O
and O
the O
girl O
's O
father O
and O
mother O
go O
inside O
with O
him O
. O

Everyone O
was O
crying O
and O
feeling O
sad O
because O
the O
girl O
was O
dead O
. O

But O
Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
cry O
. O

She O
is O
not O
dead O
. O

She O
is O
only O
sleeping O
. O
'' O

The O
people O
laughed O
at O
him O
, O
because O
they O
knew O
that O
the O
girl O
was O
dead O
. O

But O
Jesus O
held O
her O
hand O
and O
called O
to O
her O
, O
`` O
Little O
girl O
, O
stand O
up O
! O
'' O

Her O
spirit O
came O
back O
into O
her O
, O
and O
she O
stood O
up O
immediately O
. O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Give O
her O
something O
to O
eat O
. O
'' O

The O
girl O
's O
parents O
were O
amazed O
. O

He O
told O
them O
not O
to O
tell O
anyone O
about O
what O
happened O
. O

As O
Jesus O
stood O
beside O
Lake O
Galilee O
, O
a O
crowd O
of O
people O
pushed O
to O
get O
closer O
to O
him O
and O
to O
hear O
the O
teachings O
of O
God O
. O

Jesus O
saw O
two O
boats O
at O
the O
shore O
of O
the O
lake O
. O

The O
fishermen O
were O
washing O
their O
nets O
. O

Jesus O
got O
into O
the O
boat O
that O
belonged O
to O
Simon O
. O

He O
asked O
Simon O
to O
push O
off O
a O
little O
from O
the O
shore O
. O

Then O
he O
sat O
down O
in O
the O
boat O
and O
taught O
the O
people O
on O
the O
shore O
. O

When O
Jesus O
finished O
speaking O
, O
he O
said O
to O
Simon O
, O
`` O

Take O
the O
boat O
into O
the O
deep O
water O
. O

If O
all O
of O
you O
will O
put O
your O
nets O
into O
the O
water O
, O
you O
will O
catch O
some O
fish O
. O
'' O

Simon O
answered O
, O
`` O
Master O
, O
we O
worked O
hard O
all O
night O
trying O
to O
catch O
fish O
and O
caught O
nothing O
. O

But O
you O
say O
I O
should O
put O
the O
nets O
into O
the O
water O
, O
so O
I O
will O
. O
'' O

The O
fishermen O
put O
their O
nets O
into O
the O
water O
. O

Their O
nets O
were O
filled O
with O
so O
many O
fish O
that O
they O
began O
to O
break O
. O

They O
called O
to O
their O
friends O
in O
the O
other O
boat O
to O
come O
and O
help O
them O
. O

The O
friends O
came O
, O
and O
both O
boats O
were O
filled O
so O
full O
of O
fish O
that O
they O
were O
almost O
sinking O
. O

The O
fishermen O
were O
all O
amazed O
at O
the O
many O
fish O
they O
caught O
. O

When O
Simon O
Peter O
saw O
this O
, O
he O
bowed O
down O
before O
Jesus O
and O
said O
, O
`` O

Go O
away O
from O
me O
, O
Lord O
. O

I O
am O
a O
sinful O
man O
! O
'' O

James O
and O
John O
, O
the O
sons O
of O
Zebedee O
, O
were O
amazed O
too O
. O

-LRB- O
James O
and O
John O
worked O
together O
with O
Simon O
. O
-RRB- O

Jesus O
said O
to O
Simon O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
be O
afraid O
. O

From O
now O
on O
your O
work O
will O
be O
to O
bring O
in O
people O
, O
not O
fish O
! O
'' O

The O
men O
brought O
their O
boats O
to O
the O
shore O
. O

They O
left O
everything O
and O
followed O
Jesus O
. O

One O
time O
Jesus O
was O
in O
a O
town O
where O
a O
very O
sick O
man O
lived O
. O

This O
man O
was O
covered O
with O
leprosy O
. O

When O
the O
man O
saw O
Jesus O
, O
he O
bowed O
before O
Jesus O
and O
begged O
him O
, O
`` O

Lord O
, O
you O
have O
the O
power O
to O
heal O
me O
if O
you O
want O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
want O
to O
heal O
you O
. O

Be O
healed O
! O
'' O

Then O
he O
touched O
the O
man O
, O
and O
immediately O
the O
leprosy O
disappeared O
. O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
tell O
anyone O
about O
what O
happened O
. O

But O
go O
and O
let O
the O
priest O
look O
at O
you O
. O

And O
offer O
a O
gift O
to O
God O
for O
your O
healing O
as O
Moses O
commanded O
. O

This O
will O
show O
people O
that O
you O
are O
healed O
. O
'' O

But O
the O
news O
about O
Jesus O
spread O
more O
and O
more O
. O

Many O
people O
came O
to O
hear O
him O
and O
to O
be O
healed O
of O
their O
sicknesses O
. O

Jesus O
often O
went O
away O
to O
other O
places O
to O
be O
alone O
so O
that O
he O
could O
pray O
. O

One O
day O
Jesus O
was O
teaching O
the O
people O
. O

The O
Pharisees O
and O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
were O
sitting O
there O
too O
. O

They O
had O
come O
from O
every O
town O
in O
Galilee O
and O
Judea O
and O
from O
Jerusalem O
. O

The O
Lord O
was O
giving O
Jesus O
the O
power O
to O
heal O
people O
. O

There O
was O
a O
man O
who O
was O
paralyzed O
, O
and O
some O
other O
men O
were O
carrying O
him O
on O
a O
mat O
. O

They O
tried O
to O
bring O
him O
and O
put O
him O
down O
before O
Jesus O
. O

But O
there O
were O
so O
many O
people O
that O
they O
could O
not O
find O
a O
way O
to O
Jesus O
. O

So O
they O
went O
up O
on O
the O
roof O
and O
lowered O
the O
crippled O
man O
down O
through O
a O
hole O
in O
the O
ceiling O
. O

They O
lowered O
the O
mat O
into O
the O
room O
so O
that O
the O
crippled O
man O
was O
lying O
before O
Jesus O
. O

Jesus O
saw O
how O
much O
faith O
they O
had O
and O
said O
to O
the O
sick O
man O
, O
`` O
Friend O
, O
your O
sins O
are O
forgiven O
. O
'' O

The O
Jewish O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
and O
the O
Pharisees O
thought O
to O
themselves O
, O
`` O
Who O
is O
this O
man O
who O
dares O
to O
say O
such O
things O
? O

What O
an O
insult O
to O
God O
! O

No O
one O
but O
God O
can O
forgive O
sins O
. O
'' O

But O
Jesus O
knew O
what O
they O
were O
thinking O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Why O
do O
you O
have O
these O
questions O
in O
your O
minds O
? O

The O
Son O
of O
Man O
has O
power O
on O
earth O
to O
forgive O
sins O
. O

But O
how O
can O
I O
prove O
this O
to O
you O
? O

Maybe O
you O
are O
thinking O
it O
was O
easy O
for O
me O
to O
say O
, O
' O
Your O
sins O
are O
forgiven O
. O
' O

There O
's O
no O
proof O
that O
it O
really O
happened O
. O

But O
what O
if O
I O
say O
to O
the O
man O
, O
' O
Stand O
up O
and O
walk O
' O
? O

Then O
you O
will O
be O
able O
to O
see O
that O
I O
really O
have O
this O
power O
. O
'' O

So O
Jesus O
said O
to O
the O
paralyzed O
man O
, O
`` O
I O
tell O
you O
, O
stand O
up O
! O

Take O
your O
mat O
and O
go O
home O
! O
'' O

The O
man O
immediately O
stood O
up O
in O
front O
of O
everyone O
. O

He O
picked O
up O
his O
mat O
and O
walked O
home O
, O
praising O
God O
. O

Everyone O
was O
completely O
amazed O
and O
began O
to O
praise O
God O
. O

They O
were O
filled O
with O
great O
respect O
for O
God O
's O
power O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Today O
we O
saw O
amazing O
things O
! O
'' O

After O
this O
Jesus O
went O
out O
and O
saw O
a O
tax O
collector O
sitting O
at O
his O
place O
for O
collecting O
taxes O
. O

His O
name O
was O
Levi O
. O

Jesus O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Follow O
me O
! O
'' O

Levi O
got O
up O
, O
left O
everything O
, O
and O
followed O
Jesus O
. O

Then O
Levi O
gave O
a O
big O
dinner O
at O
his O
house O
for O
Jesus O
. O

At O
the O
table O
there O
were O
many O
tax O
collectors O
and O
some O
other O
people O
too O
. O

But O
the O
Pharisees O
and O
those O
who O
taught O
the O
law O
for O
the O
Pharisees O
began O
to O
complain O
to O
the O
followers O
of O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
Why O
do O
you O
eat O
and O
drink O
with O
tax O
collectors O
and O
other O
sinners O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
them O
, O
`` O
It O
is O
the O
sick O
people O
who O
need O
a O
doctor O
, O
not O
those O
who O
are O
healthy O
. O

I O
have O
not O
come O
to O
ask O
good O
people O
to O
change O
. O

I O
have O
come O
to O
ask O
sinners O
to O
change O
the O
way O
they O
live O
. O
'' O

They O
said O
to O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
John O
's O
followers O
often O
fast O
and O
pray O
, O
the O
same O
as O
the O
followers O
of O
the O
Pharisees O
. O

But O
your O
followers O
eat O
and O
drink O
all O
the O
time O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
At O
a O
wedding O
you O
ca O
n't O
ask O
the O
friends O
of O
the O
bridegroom O
to O
be O
sad O
and O
fast O
while O
he O
is O
still O
with O
them O
. O

But O
the O
time O
will O
come O
when O
the O
groom O
will O
be O
taken O
away O
from O
them O
. O

Then O
his O
friends O
will O
fast O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
told O
them O
this O
story O
: O
`` O
No O
one O
takes O
cloth O
off O
a O
new O
coat O
to O
cover O
a O
hole O
in O
an O
old O
coat O
. O

That O
would O
ruin O
the O
new O
coat O
, O
and O
the O
cloth O
from O
the O
new O
coat O
would O
not O
be O
the O
same O
as O
the O
old O
cloth O
. O

Also O
, O
no O
one O
ever O
pours O
new O
wine O
into O
old O
wineskins O
. O

The O
new O
wine O
would O
break O
them O
. O

The O
wine O
would O
spill O
out O
, O
and O
the O
wineskins O
would O
be O
ruined O
. O

You O
always O
put O
new O
wine O
into O
new O
wineskins O
. O

No O
one O
who O
drinks O
old O
wine O
wants O
new O
wine O
. O

They O
say O
, O
' O
The O
old O
wine O
is O
just O
fine O
. O
' O
'' O

It O
was O
the O
15th O
year O
of O
the O
rule O
of O
Tiberius O
Caesar O
. O

These O
men O
were O
under O
Caesar O
: O
Pontius O
Pilate O
, O
the O
governor O
of O
Judea O
; O
Herod O
, O
the O
ruler O
of O
Galilee O
; O
Philip O
, O
Herod O
's O
brother O
, O
the O
ruler O
of O
Iturea O
and O
Trachonitis O
; O
Lysanias O
, O
the O
ruler O
of O
Abilene O
. O

Annas O
and O
Caiaphas O
were O
the O
high O
priests O
. O

During O
this O
time O
, O
John O
, O
the O
son O
of O
Zechariah O
, O
was O
living O
in O
the O
desert O
, O
and O
he O
received O
a O
message O
from O
God O
. O

So O
he O
went O
through O
the O
whole O
area O
around O
the O
Jordan O
River O
and O
told O
the O
people O
God O
's O
message O
. O

He O
told O
them O
to O
be O
baptized O
to O
show O
that O
they O
wanted O
to O
change O
their O
lives O
, O
and O
then O
their O
sins O
would O
be O
forgiven O
. O

This O
is O
like O
the O
words O
written O
in O
the O
book O
of O
Isaiah O
the O
prophet O
: O
`` O
There O
is O
someone O
shouting O
in O
the O
desert O
: O
' O
Prepare O
the O
way O
for O
the O
Lord O
. O

Make O
the O
road O
straight O
for O
him O
. O

Every O
valley O
will O
be O
filled O
, O
and O
every O
mountain O
and O
hill O
will O
be O
made O
flat O
. O

Crooked O
roads O
will O
be O
made O
straight O
, O
and O
rough O
roads O
will O
be O
made O
smooth O
. O

Then O
everyone O
will O
see O
how O
God O
will O
save O
his O
people O
! O
' O
'' O

Crowds O
of O
people O
came O
to O
be O
baptized O
by O
John O
. O

But O
he O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
You O
are O
all O
snakes O
! O

Who O
warned O
you O
to O
run O
from O
God O
's O
judgment O
that O
is O
coming O
? O

Change O
your O
hearts O
! O

And O
show O
by O
your O
lives O
that O
you O
have O
changed O
. O

I O
know O
what O
you O
are O
about O
to O
say O
-- O
`` O
but O
Abraham O
is O
our O
father O
! O
' O

That O
means O
nothing O
. O

I O
tell O
you O
that O
God O
can O
make O
children O
for O
Abraham O
from O
these O
rocks O
! O

The O
ax O
is O
now O
ready O
to O
cut O
down O
the O
trees O
. O

Every O
tree O
that O
does O
not O
produce O
good O
fruit O
will O
be O
cut O
down O
and O
thrown O
into O
the O
fire O
. O
'' O

The O
people O
asked O
John O
, O
`` O
What O
should O
we O
do O
? O
'' O

He O
answered O
, O
`` O
If O
you O
have O
two O
shirts O
, O
share O
with O
someone O
who O
does O
not O
have O
one O
. O

If O
you O
have O
food O
, O
share O
that O
too O
. O
'' O

Even O
the O
tax O
collectors O
came O
to O
John O
. O

They O
wanted O
to O
be O
baptized O
. O

They O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Teacher O
, O
what O
should O
we O
do O
? O
'' O

He O
told O
them O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
take O
more O
taxes O
from O
people O
than O
you O
have O
been O
ordered O
to O
collect O
. O
'' O

The O
soldiers O
asked O
him O
, O
`` O
What O
about O
us O
? O

What O
should O
we O
do O
? O
'' O

He O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
use O
force O
or O
lies O
to O
make O
people O
give O
you O
money O
. O

Be O
happy O
with O
the O
pay O
you O
get O
. O
'' O

Everyone O
was O
hoping O
for O
the O
Christ O
to O
come O
, O
and O
they O
wondered O
about O
John O
. O

They O
thought O
, O
`` O
Maybe O
he O
is O
the O
Christ O
. O
'' O

John O
's O
answer O
to O
this O
was O
, O
`` O
I O
baptize O
you O
in O
water O
, O
but O
there O
is O
someone O
coming O
later O
who O
is O
able O
to O
do O
more O
than O
I O
can O
. O

I O
am O
not O
good O
enough O
to O
be O
the O
slave O
who O
unties O
his O
sandals O
. O

He O
will O
baptize O
you O
with O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
and O
with O
fire O
. O

He O
will O
come O
ready O
to O
clean O
the O
grain O
. O

He O
will O
separate O
the O
good O
grain O
from O
the O
straw O
, O
and O
he O
will O
put O
the O
good O
part O
into O
his O
barn O
. O

Then O
he O
will O
burn O
the O
useless O
part O
with O
a O
fire O
that O
can O
not O
be O
stopped O
. O
'' O

John O
said O
many O
other O
things O
like O
this O
to O
encourage O
the O
people O
to O
change O
, O
and O
he O
told O
them O
the O
Good O
News O
. O

John O
criticized O
Herod O
the O
ruler O
for O
what O
he O
had O
done O
with O
Herodias O
, O
the O
wife O
of O
Herod O
's O
brother O
, O
as O
well O
as O
for O
all O
the O
other O
bad O
things O
he O
had O
done O
. O

So O
Herod O
added O
another O
bad O
thing O
to O
all O
his O
other O
wrongs O
: O
He O
put O
John O
in O
jail O
. O

When O
all O
the O
people O
were O
being O
baptized O
, O
Jesus O
came O
and O
was O
baptized O

`` O

Suppose O

you O
has O
100 O
sheep O

but O
one O

What O

you O

? O

You O
will O
leave O
the O

99 O
sheep O
there O
in O
the O
field O

go O
out O

look O

You O

And O
when O
you O
find O
it O

you O

You O

more O

do O

A O

there O
was O

him O
into O
the O
fields O
to O
feed O
pigs O
. O

He O
was O
so O
hungry O
that O
he O
wanted O
to O
eat O
the O
food O
the O
pigs O
were O
eating O
. O

But O
no O
one O
gave O
him O
anything O
. O

`` O
The O
son O
realized O
that O
he O
had O
been O
very O
foolish O
. O

He O
thought O
, O
' O
All O
my O
father O
's O
hired O
workers O
have O
plenty O
of O
food O
. O

But O
here O
I O
am O
, O
almost O
dead O
because O
I O
have O
nothing O
to O
eat O
. O

I O
will O
leave O
and O
go O
to O
my O
father O
. O

I O
will O
say O
to O
him O
: O
Father O
, O
I O
have O
sinned O
against O
God O
and O
have O
done O
wrong O
to O
you O
. O

I O
am O
no O
longer O
worthy O
to O
be O
called O
your O
son O
. O

But O
let O
me O
be O
like O
one O
of O
your O
hired O
workers O
. O
' O

So O
he O
left O
and O
went O
to O
his O
father O
. O

`` O
While O
the O
son O
was O
still O
a O
long O
way O
off O
, O
his O
father O
saw O
him O
coming O
and O
felt O
sorry O
for O
him O
. O

So O
he O
ran O
to O
him O
and O
hugged O
and O
kissed O
him O
. O

The O
son O
said O
, O
' O
Father O
, O
I O
have O
sinned O
against O
God O
and O
have O
done O
wrong O
to O
you O
. O

I O
am O
no O
longer O
worthy O
to O
be O
called O
your O
son O
. O
' O

`` O
But O
the O
father O
said O
to O
his O
servants O
, O
' O
Hurry O
! O

Bring O
the O
best O
clothes O
and O
put O
them O
on O
him O
. O

Also O
, O
put O
a O
ring O
on O
his O
finger O
and O
good O
sandals O
on O
his O
feet O
. O

And O
bring O
our O
best O
calf O
and O
kill O
it O
so O
that O
we O
can O
celebrate O
with O
plenty O
to O
eat O
. O

My O
son O
was O
dead O
, O
but O
now O
he O
is O
alive O
again O
! O

He O
was O
lost O
, O
but O
now O
he O
is O
found O
! O
' O

So O
they O
began O
to O
have O
a O
party O
. O

`` O
The O
older O
son O
had O
been O
out O
in O
the O
field O
. O

When O
he O
came O
near O
the O
house O
, O
he O
heard O
the O
sound O
of O
music O
and O
dancing O
. O

So O
he O
called O
to O
one O
of O
the O
servant O
boys O
and O
asked O
, O
' O
What O
does O
all O
this O
mean O
? O
' O

The O
boy O
said O
, O
' O
Your O
brother O
has O
come O
back O
, O
and O
your O
father O
killed O
the O
best O
calf O
to O
eat O
. O

He O
is O
happy O
because O
he O
has O
his O
son O
back O
safe O
and O
sound O
. O
' O

`` O
The O
older O
son O
was O
angry O
and O
would O
not O
go O
in O
to O
the O
party O
. O

So O
his O
father O
went O
out O
and O
begged O
him O
to O
come O
in O
. O

But O
he O
said O
to O
his O
father O
, O
' O
Look O
, O
for O
all O
these O
years O
I O
have O
worked O
like O
a O
slave O
for O
you O

I O
have O
always O
done O
what O
you O
told O
me O
to O
do O
, O
and O
you O
never O
gave O
me O
even O
a O
young O
goat O
for O
a O
party O
with O
my O
friends O
. O

But O
then O
this O
son O
of O
yours O
comes O
home O
after O
wasting O
your O
money O
on O
prostitutes O
, O
and O
you O
kill O
the O
best O
calf O
for O
him O
! O
' O

`` O
His O
father O
said O
to O
him O
, O
' O
Oh O
, O
my O
son O
, O
you O
are O
always O
with O
me O
, O
and O
everything O
I O
have O
is O
yours O
. O

But O
this O
was O
a O
day O
to O
be O
happy O
and O
celebrate O
. O

Your O
brother O
was O
dead O
, O
but O
now O
he O
is O
alive O
. O

He O
was O
lost O
, O
but O
now O
he O
is O
found O

' O
'' O

It O
was O
about O
that O
same O
time O
that O
Augustus O
Caesar O
sent O
out O
an O
order O
to O
all O
people O
in O
the O
countries O
that O
were O
under O
Roman O
rule O
. O

The O
order O
said O
that O
everyone O
's O
name O
must O
be O
put O
on O
a O
list O
. O

This O
was O
the O
first O
counting O
of O
all O
the O
people O
while O
Quirinius O
was O
governor O
of O
Syria O
. O

Everyone O
traveled O
to O
their O
own O
hometowns O
to O
have O
their O
name O
put O
on O
the O
list O
. O

So O
Joseph O
left O
Nazareth O
, O
a O
town O
in O
Galilee O
, O
and O
went O
to O
the O
town O
of O
Bethlehem O
in O
Judea O
. O

It O
was O
known O
as O
the O
town O
of O
David O
. O

Joseph O
went O
there O
because O
he O
was O
from O
the O
family O
of O
David O
. O

Joseph O
registered O
with O
Mary O
because O
she O
was O
engaged O
to O
marry O
him O
. O

-LRB- O
She O
was O
now O
pregnant O
. O
-RRB- O

While O
Joseph O
and O
Mary O
were O
in O
Bethlehem O
, O
the O
time O
came O
for O
her O
to O
have O
the O
baby O
. O

She O
gave O
birth O
to O
her O
first O
son O
. O

She O
wrapped O
him O
up O
well O
and O
laid O
him O
in O
a O
box O
where O
cattle O
are O
fed O
. O

She O
put O
him O
there O
because O
the O
guest O
room O
was O
full O
. O

That O
night O
, O
some O
shepherds O
were O
out O
in O
the O
fields O
near O
Bethlehem O
watching O
their O
sheep O
. O

An O
angel O
of O
the O
Lord O
appeared O
to O
them O
, O
and O
the O
glory O
of O
the O
Lord O
was O
shining O
around O
them O
. O

The O
shepherds O
were O
very O
afraid O
. O

The O
angel O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
be O
afraid O
. O

I O
have O
some O
very O
good O
news O
for O
you O
-- O
news O
that O
will O
make O
everyone O
happy O
. O

Today O
your O
Savior O
was O
born O
in O
David O
's O
town O
. O

He O
is O
Christ O
, O
the O
Lord O
. O

This O
is O
how O
you O
will O
know O
him O
: O
You O
will O
find O
a O
baby O
wrapped O
in O
pieces O
of O
cloth O
and O
lying O
in O
a O
feeding O
box O
. O
'' O

Then O
a O
huge O
army O
of O
angels O
from O
heaven O
joined O
the O
first O
angel O
, O
and O
they O
were O
all O
praising O
God O
, O
saying O
, O
`` O

Praise O
God O
in O
heaven O
, O
and O
on O
earth O
let O
there O
be O
peace O
to O
the O
people O
who O
please O
him O
. O
'' O

The O
angels O
left O
the O
shepherds O
and O
went O
back O
to O
heaven O
. O

The O
shepherds O
said O
to O
each O
other O
, O
`` O
Let O
's O
go O
to O
Bethlehem O
and O
see O
this O
great O
event O
the O
Lord O
has O
told O
us O
about O
. O
'' O

So O
they O
went O
running O
and O
found O
Mary O
and O
Joseph O
. O

And O
there O
was O
the O
baby O
, O
lying O
in O
the O
feeding O
box O
. O

When O
they O
saw O
the O
baby O
, O
they O
told O
what O
the O
angels O
said O
about O
this O
child O
. O

Everyone O
was O
surprised O
when O
they O
heard O
what O
the O
shepherds O
told O
them O
. O

Mary O
continued O
to O
think O
about O
these O
things O
, O
trying O
to O
understand O
them O
. O

The O
shepherds O
went O
back O
to O
their O
sheep O
, O
praising O
God O
and O
thanking O
him O
for O
everything O
they O
had O
seen O
and O
heard O
. O

It O
was O
just O
as O
the O
angel O
had O
told O
them O
. O

When O
the O
baby O
was O
eight O
days O
old O
, O
he O
was O
circumcised O
, O
and O
he O
was O
named O
Jesus O
. O

This O
name O
was O
given O
by O
the O
angel O
before O
the O
baby O
began O
to O
grow O
inside O
Mary O
. O

The O
time O
came O
for O
Mary O
and O
Joseph O
to O
do O
the O
things O
the O
Law O
of O
Moses O
taught O
about O
being O
made O
pure O
. O

They O
brought O
Jesus O
to O
Jerusalem O
so O
that O
they O
could O
present O
him O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

It O
is O
written O
in O
the O
law O
of O
the O
Lord O
: O
`` O
When O
a O
mother O
's O
first O
baby O
is O
a O
boy O
, O
he O
shall O
be O
called O
' O
special O
for O
the O
Lord O
. O
' O
'' O

The O
law O
of O
the O
Lord O
also O
says O
that O
people O
must O
give O
a O
sacrifice O
: O
`` O
You O
must O
sacrifice O
two O
doves O
or O
two O
young O
pigeons O
. O
'' O

So O
Joseph O
and O
Mary O
went O
to O
Jerusalem O
to O
do O
this O
. O

A O
man O
named O
Simeon O
lived O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

He O
was O
a O
good O
man O
who O
was O
devoted O
to O
God O
. O

He O
was O
waiting O
for O
the O
time O
when O
God O
would O
come O
to O
help O
Israel O
. O

The O
Holy O
Spirit O
was O
with O
him O
. O

The O
Holy O
Spirit O
told O
him O
that O
he O
would O
not O
die O
before O
he O
saw O
the O
Christ O
from O
the O
Lord O
. O

The O
Spirit O
led O
Simeon O
to O
the O
Temple O
. O

So O
he O
was O
there O
when O
Mary O
and O
Joseph O
brought O
the O
baby O
Jesus O
to O
do O
what O
the O
Jewish O
law O
said O
they O
must O
do O
. O

Simeon O
took O
the O
baby O
in O
his O
arms O
and O
thanked O
God O
: O
`` O
Now O
, O
Lord O
, O
you O
can O
let O
me O
, O
your O
servant O
, O
die O
in O
peace O
as O
you O
said O
. O

I O
have O
seen O
with O
my O
own O
eyes O
how O
you O
will O
save O
your O
people O
. O

Now O
all O
people O
can O
see O
your O
plan O
. O

He O
is O
a O
light O
to O
show O
your O
way O
to O
the O
other O
nations O
. O

And O
he O
will O
bring O
honor O
to O
your O
people O
Israel O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
' O
father O
and O
mother O
were O
amazed O
at O
what O
Simeon O
said O
about O
him O
. O

Then O
Simeon O
blessed O
them O
and O
said O
to O
Mary O
, O
`` O
Many O
Jews O
will O
fall O
and O
many O
will O
rise O
because O
of O
this O
boy O
. O

He O
will O
be O
a O
sign O
from O
God O
that O
some O
will O
not O
accept O
. O

So O
the O
secret O
thoughts O
of O
many O
will O
be O
made O
known O
. O

And O
the O
things O
that O
happen O
will O
be O
painful O
for O
you O
-- O
like O
a O
sword O
cutting O
through O
your O
heart O
. O
'' O

Anna O
, O
a O
prophetess O
, O
was O
there O
at O
the O
Temple O
. O

She O
was O
from O
the O
family O
of O
Phanuel O
in O
the O
tribe O
of O
Asher O
. O

She O
was O
now O
very O
old O
. O

She O
had O
lived O
with O
her O
husband O
seven O
years O
before O
he O
died O
and O
left O
her O
alone O
. O

She O
was O
now O
84 O
years O
old O
. O

Anna O
was O
always O
at O
the O
Temple O
; O
she O
never O
left O
. O

She O
worshiped O
God O
by O
fasting O
and O
praying O
day O
and O
night O
. O

Anna O
was O
there O
when O
Joseph O
and O
Mary O
came O
to O
the O
Temple O
. O

She O
praised O
God O
and O
talked O
about O
Jesus O
to O
all O
those O
who O
were O
waiting O
for O
God O
to O
free O
Jerusalem O
. O

Joseph O
and O
Mary O
finished O
doing O
all O
the O
things O
that O
the O
law O
of O
the O
Lord O
commanded O
. O

Then O
they O
went O
home O
to O
Nazareth O
, O
their O
own O
town O
in O
Galilee O
. O

The O
little O
boy O
Jesus O
was O
developing O
into O
a O
mature O
young O
man O
, O
full O
of O
wisdom O
. O

God O
was O
blessing O
him O
. O

Every O
year O
Jesus O
' O
parents O
went O
to O
Jerusalem O
for O
the O
Passover O
festival O
. O

When O
Jesus O
was O
twelve O
years O
old O
, O
they O
went O
to O
the O
festival O
as O
usual O
. O

When O
the O
festival O
was O
over O
, O
they O
went O
home O
, O
but O
Jesus O
stayed O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

His O
parents O
did O
not O
know O
about O
it O
. O

They O
traveled O
for O
a O
whole O
day O
thinking O
that O
Jesus O
was O
with O
them O
in O
the O
group O
. O

They O
began O
looking O
for O
him O
among O
their O
family O
and O
close O
friends O
, O
but O
they O
did O
not O
find O
him O
. O

So O
they O
went O
back O
to O
Jerusalem O
to O
look O
for O
him O
there O
. O

After O
three O
days O
they O
found O
him O
. O

Jesus O
was O
sitting O
in O
the O
Temple O
area O
with O
the O
religious O
teachers O
, O
listening O
and O
asking O
them O
questions O
. O

Everyone O
who O
heard O
him O
was O
amazed O
at O
his O
understanding O
and O
wise O
answers O
. O

When O
his O
parents O
saw O
him O
, O
they O
wondered O
how O
this O
was O
possible O
. O

And O
his O
mother O
said O
, O
`` O
Son O
, O
why O
did O
you O
do O
this O
to O
us O
? O

Your O
father O
and O
I O
were O
very O
worried O
about O
you O
. O

We O
have O
been O
looking O
for O
you O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Why O
did O
you O
have O
to O
look O
for O
me O
? O

You O
should O
have O
known O
that O
I O
must O
be O
where O
my O
Father O
's O
work O
is O
. O
'' O

But O
they O
did O
not O
understand O
the O
meaning O
of O
what O
he O
said O
to O
them O
. O

Jesus O
went O
with O
them O
to O
Nazareth O
and O
obeyed O
them O
. O

His O
mother O
was O
still O
thinking O
about O
all O
these O
things O
. O

As O
Jesus O
grew O
taller O
, O
he O
continued O
to O
grow O
in O
wisdom O
. O

God O
was O
pleased O
with O
him O
and O
so O
were O
the O
people O
who O
knew O
him O
. O

Some O
people O
there O
with O
Jesus O
at O
that O
time O
told O
him O
about O
what O
had O
happened O
to O
some O
worshipers O
from O
Galilee O
. O

Pilate O
had O
them O
killed O
. O

Their O
blood O
was O
mixed O
with O
the O
blood O
of O
the O
animals O
they O
had O
brought O
for O
sacrificing O
. O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
Do O
you O
think O
this O
happened O
to O
those O
people O
because O
they O
were O
more O
sinful O
than O
all O
other O
people O
from O
Galilee O
? O

No O
, O
they O
were O
not O
. O

But O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
decide O
now O
to O
change O
your O
lives O
, O
you O
will O
all O
be O
destroyed O
like O
those O
people O
! O

And O
what O
about O
those O
18 O
people O
who O
died O
when O
the O
tower O
of O
Siloam O
fell O
on O
them O
? O

Do O
you O
think O
they O
were O
more O
sinful O
than O
everyone O
else O
in O
Jerusalem O
? O

They O
were O
not O
. O

But O
I O
tell O
you O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
decide O
now O
to O
change O
your O
lives O
, O
you O
will O
all O
be O
destroyed O
too O
! O
'' O

Jesus O
told O
this O
story O
: O
`` O
A O
man O
had O
a O
fig O
tree O
. O

He O
planted O
it O
in O
his O
garden O
. O

He O
came O
looking O
for O
some O
fruit O
on O
it O
, O
but O
he O
found O
none O
. O

He O
had O
a O
servant O
who O
took O
care O
of O
his O
garden O
. O

So O
he O
said O
to O
his O
servant O
, O
' O
I O
have O
been O
looking O
for O
fruit O
on O
this O
tree O
for O
three O
years O
, O
but O
I O
never O
find O
any O

should O
it O

the O
servant O
answered O
, O

Master O
, O
let O
the O
tree O

one O

the O
tree O
will O
have O
fruit O
on O
it O
next O

If O
it O
still O

not O

you O

Jesus O
taught O
in O
one O
of O
the O
synagogues O
on O
the O
Sabbath O
day O
. O

A O
woman O
was O
there O
who O
had O
an O
evil O
spirit O
inside O
her O
. O

It O
had O
made O
the O
woman O
crippled O
for O
18 O
years O
. O

Her O
back O
was O
always O
bent O
; O
she O
could O
not O
stand O
up O
straight O
. O

When O
Jesus O
saw O
her O
, O
he O
called O
to O
her O
, O
`` O
Woman O
, O
you O
have O
been O
made O
free O
from O
your O
sickness O
! O
'' O

He O
laid O
his O
hands O
on O
her O
, O
and O
immediately O
she O
was O
able O
to O
stand O
up O
straight O
. O

She O
began O
praising O
God O
. O

The O
synagogue O
leader O
was O
angry O
because O
Jesus O
healed O
on O
the O
Sabbath O
day O
. O

He O
said O
to O
the O
people O
, O
`` O
There O
are O
six O
days O
for O
work O
. O

So O
come O
to O
be O
healed O
on O
one O
of O
those O
days O
. O

Do O
n't O
come O
for O
healing O
on O
the O
Sabbath O
day O
. O
'' O

The O
Lord O
answered O
, O
`` O
You O
people O
are O
hypocrites O
! O

All O
of O
you O
untie O
your O
work O
animals O
and O
lead O
them O
to O
drink O
water O
every O
day O
-- O
even O
on O
the O
Sabbath O
day O
. O

This O
woman O
that O
I O
healed O
is O
a O
true O
descendant O
of O
Abraham O
. O

But O
Satan O
has O
held O
her O
for O
18 O
years O
. O

Surely O
it O
is O
not O
wrong O
for O
her O
to O
be O
made O
free O
from O
her O
sickness O
on O
a O
Sabbath O
day O
! O
'' O

When O
Jesus O
said O
this O
, O
all O
those O
who O
were O
criticizing O
him O
felt O
ashamed O
of O
themselves O
. O

And O
all O
the O
people O
were O
happy O
for O
the O
wonderful O
things O
he O
was O
doing O
. O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
What O
is O
God O
's O
kingdom O
like O
? O

What O
can O
I O
compare O
it O
to O
? O

God O
's O
kingdom O
is O
like O
the O
seed O
of O
the O
mustard O
plant O
. O

Someone O
plants O
this O
seed O
in O
their O
garden O
. O

The O
seed O
grows O
and O
becomes O
a O
tree O
, O
and O
the O
birds O
build O
nests O
on O
its O
branches O

Jesus O
said O
again O
, O
`` O
What O
can O
I O
compare O
God O
's O
kingdom O
with O

It O
is O
like O
yeast O
that O
a O
woman O
mixes O
into O
a O
big O
bowl O
of O
flour O

Jesus O
was O
teaching O
in O
every O
town O
and O
village O
. O

He O
continued O
to O
travel O
toward O
Jerusalem O

Someone O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O

`` O

hard O

Many O

will O
want O
to O
enter O
there O

they O
will O
not O

If O
a O

Lord O

'' O

Jesus O
said O
to O
his O
followers O
, O
`` O
Once O
there O
was O
a O
rich O
man O
. O

He O
hired O
a O
manager O
to O
take O
care O
of O
his O
business O
. O

Later O
, O
he O
learned O
that O
his O
manager O
was O
cheating O
him O
. O

So O
he O
called O
the O
manager O
in O
and O
said O
to O
him O
, O
' O
I O
have O
heard O
bad O
things O
about O
you O
. O

Give O
me O
a O
report O
of O
what O
you O
have O
done O
with O
my O
money O

You O
ca O
n't O
be O
my O
manager O
anymore O

' O

`` O
So O
, O
the O
manager O
thought O
to O
himself O
, O
' O
What O
will O
I O
do O
? O

My O
master O
is O
taking O
my O
job O
away O
from O
me O

I O
am O
not O
strong O
enough O
to O
dig O
ditches O
. O

I O
am O
too O
proud O
to O
beg O

I O
know O
what O
I O
will O
do O

I O
will O
do O
something O
to O
make O

so O
that O
when O
I O
lose O
my O
job O

they O
will O
welcome O
me O

homes O

`` O
So O
the O
manager O
called O
in O
each O
person O
who O
owed O
the O
master O
some O
money O

He O
asked O
the O
first O
one O
, O
' O
How O
much O
do O
you O
owe O
my O
master O
? O
' O

He O
answered O
, O
' O
I O
owe O
him O
100 O
jars O
of O
olive O
oil O
. O
' O

The O
manager O
said O
to O
him O
, O
' O
Here O
is O
your O
bill O
. O

Hurry O
! O

Sit O
down O
and O
make O
the O
bill O
less O
. O

Write O
50 O
jars O
. O
' O

`` O
Then O
the O
manager O
asked O
another O
one O
, O
' O
How O
much O
do O
you O
owe O
my O
master O
? O
' O

He O
answered O
, O
' O
I O
owe O
him O
100 O
measures O
of O
wheat O
. O
' O

Then O
the O
manager O
said O
to O
him O
, O
' O
Here O
is O
your O
bill O
; O
you O
can O
make O
it O
less O
. O

Write O
80 O
measures O
. O
' O

`` O
Later O
, O
the O
master O
told O
the O
dishonest O
manager O
that O
he O
had O
done O
a O
smart O
thing O
. O

Yes O
, O
worldly O
people O
are O
smarter O
in O
their O
business O
with O
each O
other O

are O

Then O
, O
when O
those O
things O
are O
gone O

you O
will O
be O
welcomed O

were O
listening O
to O
all O
these O

criticized O

all O
loved O

said O

Jesus O

of O

used O
this O

`` O
There O

His O
land O
grew O

he O

I O
can O
say O

saved O
enough O

more O
important O

They O
do O

you O

add O
any O

do O

But O
I O
tell O
you O
that O
even O
Solomon O

the O
great O

was O
not O
dressed O

beautifully O

God O
makes O
what O
grows O
in O
the O
field O
so O
beautiful O

what O
do O
you O
think O
he O
will O
do O
for O
you O

That O
's O
just O
grass O

one O
day O
it O
's O
alive O
, O
and O
the O
next O
day O
someone O
throws O
it O
into O
a O
fire O

But O
God O
cares O
enough O
to O
make O
it O
beautiful O

Surely O
he O
will O
do O
much O
more O
for O
you O

Your O
faith O
is O
so O
small O

`` O
So O
do O
n't O
always O

what O
all O
those O

your O

you O
need O

What O
you O
should O
be O

midnight O
or O
later O
for O
their O
master O
. O

But O
they O
will O
be O
glad O
they O
did O
when O
he O
comes O
in O
and O
finds O
them O
still O
waiting O
. O

`` O
Remember O
this O
: O
If O
the O
owner O
of O
the O
house O
knew O
what O
time O
a O
thief O
was O
coming O
, O
he O
would O
not O
allow O
the O
thief O
to O
enter O
his O
house O
. O

So O
you O
also O
must O
be O
ready O
, O
because O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O
will O
come O
at O
a O
time O
when O
you O
do O
n't O
expect O
him O
! O
'' O

Peter O
said O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
did O
you O
tell O
this O
story O
for O
us O
or O
for O
all O
people O
? O
'' O

The O
Lord O
said O
, O
`` O
Who O
is O
the O
wise O
and O
trusted O
servant O
? O

The O
master O
trusts O
one O
servant O
to O
give O
the O
other O
servants O
their O
food O
at O
the O
right O
time O
. O

Who O
is O
the O
servant O
that O
the O
master O
trusts O
to O
do O
that O
work O
? O

When O
the O
master O
comes O
and O
finds O
him O
doing O
the O
work O
he O
gave O
him O
, O
it O
will O
be O
a O
day O
of O
blessing O
for O
that O
servant O
! O

I O
can O
tell O
you O
without O
a O
doubt O
, O
the O
master O
will O
choose O
that O
servant O
to O
take O
care O
of O
everything O
he O
owns O
. O

`` O
But O
what O
will O
happen O
if O
that O
servant O
is O
evil O
and O
thinks O
his O
master O
will O
not O
come O
back O
soon O
? O

He O
will O
begin O
to O
beat O
the O
other O
servants O
, O
men O
and O
women O
. O

He O
will O
eat O
and O
drink O
until O
he O
has O
had O
too O
much O
. O

Then O
the O
master O
will O
come O
when O
the O
servant O
is O
not O
ready O
, O
at O
a O
time O
when O
the O
servant O
is O
not O
expecting O
him O
. O

Then O
the O
master O
will O
punish O
that O
servant O
and O
send O
him O
away O
to O
be O
with O
the O
other O
people O
who O
do O
n't O
obey O
. O

`` O
That O
servant O
knew O
what O
his O
master O
wanted O
him O
to O
do O
. O

But O
he O
did O
not O
make O
himself O
ready O
or O
try O
to O
do O
what O
his O
master O
wanted O
. O

So O
that O
servant O
will O
be O
punished O
very O
much O
! O

But O
what O
about O
the O
servant O
who O
does O
not O
know O
what O
his O
master O
wants O
? O

He O
also O
does O
things O
that O
deserve O
punishment O
. O

But O
he O
will O
get O
less O
punishment O
than O
the O
servant O
who O
knew O
what O
he O
should O
do O
. O

Whoever O
has O
been O
given O
much O
will O
be O
responsible O
for O
much O
. O

Much O
more O
will O
be O
expected O
from O
the O
one O
who O
has O
been O
given O
more O

Jesus O
continued O
speaking O
: O
`` O
I O

There O

I O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
to O
the O
people O

`` O
When O
you O
see O
clouds O

in O

you O

coming O

And O
soon O
it O
begins O

When O
you O
feel O
the O
wind O

blow O
from O
the O
south O
, O
you O
say O
, O
' O
It O
will O
be O
a O
hot O
day O

' O

And O
you O
are O
right O
. O

You O
hypocrites O
! O

You O
can O
understand O
the O
weather O
. O

Why O
do O
n't O
you O
understand O
what O
is O
happening O
now O
? O

`` O
Why O
ca O
n't O
you O
decide O
for O
yourselves O
what O
is O
right O
? O

Suppose O
someone O
is O
suing O
you O
, O
and O
you O
are O
both O
going O
to O
court O
. O

Try O
hard O
to O
settle O
it O
on O
the O
way O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
settle O
it O
, O
you O
may O
have O
to O
go O
before O
the O
judge O
. O

And O
the O
judge O
will O
hand O
you O
over O
to O
the O
officer O
, O
who O
will O
throw O
you O
into O
jail O

I O
tell O
you O
, O
you O
will O
not O
get O
out O
of O
there O
until O
you O

paid O
every O
cent O
you O

'' O

So O
then O
, O
stop O
doing O
anything O
to O
hurt O
others O

Do O
n't O
lie O
anymore O
, O
and O
stop O
trying O
to O
fool O
people O

Do O
n't O
be O
jealous O
or O
say O
bad O
things O
about O
others O
. O

Like O
newborn O
babies O
hungry O
for O
milk O
, O
you O
should O
want O
the O
pure O
teaching O
that O
feeds O
your O
spirit O
. O

With O
it O
you O
can O
grow O
up O
and O
be O
saved O
. O

You O
have O
already O
tasted O
the O
goodness O
of O
the O
Lord O
. O

The O
Lord O
Jesus O
is O
the O
living O
stone O
. O

The O
people O
of O
the O
world O
decided O
that O
they O
did O
not O
want O
this O
stone O
. O

But O
he O
is O
the O
one O
God O
chose O
as O
one O
of O
great O
value O
. O

So O
come O
to O
him O
. O

You O
also O
are O
like O
living O
stones O
, O
and O
God O
is O
using O
you O
to O
build O
a O
spiritual O
house O
. O

You O
are O
to O
serve O
God O
in O
this O
house O
as O
holy O
priests O
, O
offering O
him O
spiritual O
sacrifices O
that O
he O
will O
accept O
because O
of O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

The O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
Look O
, O
I O
have O
chosen O
a O
cornerstone O
of O
great O
value O
, O
and O
I O
put O
that O
stone O
in O
Zion O

Anyone O
who O
trusts O
in O
him O
will O
never O
be O
disappointed O

'' O

So O
, O
that O
stone O
means O
honor O
for O
you O
who O
believe O
. O

But O
for O
those O
who O
do O
n't O
believe O
he O
is O
`` O
the O
stone O
that O
the O
builders O
refused O
to O
accept O
, O
which O
became O
the O
most O
important O
stone O

'' O

For O
them O
he O
is O
also O
`` O
a O
stone O
that O
makes O
people O
stumble O
, O
a O
rock O
that O
makes O
people O
fall O

'' O

People O
stumble O
because O
they O
do O
n't O
obey O
what O
God O
says O
. O

This O
is O
what O
God O
planned O
to O
happen O
to O
those O
people O
. O

But O
you O
are O
his O
chosen O
people O
, O
the O
King O
's O
priests O
. O

You O
are O
a O
holy O
nation O
, O
people O
who O
belong O
to O
God O

He O
chose O
you O
to O
tell O
about O
the O
wonderful O
things O
he O
has O
done O
. O

He O
brought O
you O
out O
of O
the O
darkness O
of O
sin O
into O
his O
wonderful O
light O
. O

In O
the O
past O
you O
were O
not O
a O
special O
people O
, O
but O
now O
you O
are O
God O
's O
people O
. O

Once O
you O
had O
not O
received O
mercy O
, O
but O
now O
God O
has O
given O
you O
his O
mercy O

Dear O
friends O
, O
you O
are O
like O
visitors O
and O
strangers O
in O
this O
world O

So O
I O
beg O
you O
to O
keep O
your O
lives O
free O
from O
the O
evil O
things O
you O
want O
to O
do O
, O
those O
desires O
that O
fight O
against O
your O
true O
selves O
. O

People O
who O
do O
n't O
believe O
are O
living O
all O
around O
you O
. O

They O
may O
say O
that O
you O
are O
doing O
wrong O
. O

So O
live O
such O
good O
lives O
that O
they O
will O
see O
the O
good O
you O
do O
, O
and O
they O
will O
give O
glory O
to O
God O
on O
the O
day O
he O
comes O
. O

Be O
willing O
to O
serve O
the O
people O
who O
have O
authority O
in O
this O
world O
. O

Do O
this O
for O
the O
Lord O
. O

Obey O
the O
king O
, O
the O
highest O
authority O
. O

And O
obey O
the O
leaders O
who O
are O
sent O
by O
the O
king O
. O

They O
are O
sent O
to O
punish O
those O
who O
do O
wrong O
and O
to O
praise O
those O
who O
do O
good O
. O

When O
you O
do O
good O
, O
you O
stop O
ignorant O
people O
from O
saying O
foolish O
things O
about O
you O
. O

This O
is O
what O
God O
wants O
. O

Live O
like O
free O
people O
, O
but O
do O
n't O
use O
your O
freedom O
as O
an O
excuse O
to O
do O
evil O
. O

Live O
as O
those O
who O
are O
serving O
God O
. O

Show O
respect O
for O
all O
people O
. O

Love O
all O
the O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
of O
God O
's O
family O

Respect O
God O
, O
and O
honor O
the O
king O

Slaves O
, O
be O
willing O
to O
serve O
your O
masters O
. O

Do O
this O
with O
all O
respect O
. O

You O
should O
obey O
the O
masters O
who O
are O
good O
and O
kind O
, O
and O
you O
should O
obey O
the O
masters O
who O
are O
bad O
. O

One O
of O
you O
might O
have O
to O
suffer O
even O
when O
you O
have O
done O
nothing O
wrong O
. O

If O
you O
think O
of O
God O
and O
bear O
the O
pain O
, O
this O
pleases O
God O
. O

But O
if O
you O
are O
punished O
for O
doing O
wrong O
, O
there O
is O
no O
reason O
to O
praise O
you O
for O
bearing O
that O
punishment O
. O

But O
if O
you O
suffer O
for O
doing O
good O
and O
you O
are O
patient O
, O
this O
pleases O
God O
. O

This O
is O
what O
you O
were O
chosen O
to O
do O
. O

Christ O
gave O
you O
an O
example O
to O
follow O
. O

He O
suffered O
for O
you O
. O

So O
you O
should O
do O
the O
same O
as O
he O
did O
: O
`` O
He O
never O
sinned O
, O
and O
he O
never O
told O
a O
lie O
. O
'' O

People O
insulted O
him O
, O
but O
he O
did O
not O
insult O
them O
back O
. O

He O
suffered O
, O
but O
he O
did O
not O
threaten O
anyone O
. O

No O
, O
he O
let O
God O
take O
care O
of O
him O
. O

God O
is O
the O
one O
who O
judges O
rightly O
. O

Christ O
carried O
our O
sins O
in O
his O
body O
on O
the O
cross O
. O

He O
did O
this O
so O
that O
we O
would O
stop O
living O
for O
sin O
and O
live O
for O
what O
is O
right O
. O

By O
his O
wounds O
you O
were O
healed O
. O

You O
were O
like O
sheep O
that O
went O
the O
wrong O
way O
. O

But O
now O
you O
have O
come O
back O
to O
the O
Shepherd O
and O
Protector O
of O
your O
lives O
. O

Now O
I O
have O
something O
to O
say O
to O
the O
elders O
in O
your O
group O
. O

I O
am O
also O
an O
elder O
. O

I O
myself O
have O
seen O
Christ O
's O
sufferings O
. O

And O
I O
will O
share O
in O
the O
glory O
that O
will O
be O
shown O
to O
us O
. O

I O
beg O
you O
to O
take O
care O
of O
the O
group O
of O
people O
you O
are O
responsible O
for O
. O

They O
are O
God O
's O
flock O
. O

Watch O
over O
that O
flock O
because O
you O
want O
to O
, O
not O
because O
you O
are O
forced O
to O
do O
it O
. O

That O
is O
how O
God O
wants O
it O
. O

Do O
it O
because O
you O
are O
happy O
to O
serve O
, O
not O
because O
you O
want O
money O
. O

Do O
n't O
be O
like O
a O
ruler O
over O
those O
you O
are O
responsible O
for O
. O

But O
be O
good O
examples O
to O
them O
. O

Then O
when O
Christ O
the O
Ruling O
Shepherd O
comes O
, O
you O
will O
get O
a O
crown O
-- O
one O
that O
will O
be O
glorious O
and O
never O
lose O
its O
beauty O
. O

Young O
people O
, O
I O
have O
something O
to O
say O
to O
you O
too O
. O

You O
should O
accept O
the O
authority O
of O
the O
elders O
. O

You O
should O
all O
have O
a O
humble O
attitude O
in O
dealing O
with O
each O
other O
. O

`` O
God O
is O
against O
the O
proud O
, O
but O
he O
is O
kind O
to O
the O
humble O
. O
'' O

So O
be O
humble O
under O
God O
's O
powerful O
hand O
. O

Then O
he O
will O
lift O
you O
up O
when O
the O
right O
time O
comes O
. O

Give O
all O
your O
worries O
to O
him O
, O
because O
he O
cares O
for O
you O
. O

Control O
yourselves O
and O
be O
careful O
! O

The O
devil O
is O
your O
enemy O
, O
and O
he O
goes O
around O
like O
a O
roaring O
lion O
looking O
for O
someone O
to O
attack O
and O
eat O
. O

Refuse O
to O
follow O
the O
devil O
. O

Stand O
strong O
in O
your O
faith O
. O

You O
know O
that O
your O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
all O
over O
the O
world O
are O
having O
the O
same O
sufferings O
that O
you O
have O
. O

Yes O
, O
you O
will O
suffer O
for O
a O
short O
time O
. O

But O
after O
that O
, O
God O
will O
make O
everything O
right O
. O

He O
will O
make O
you O
strong O
. O

He O
will O
support O
you O
and O
keep O
you O
from O
falling O
. O

He O
is O
the O
God O
who O
gives O
all O
grace O
. O

He O
chose O
you O
to O
share O
in O
his O
glory O
in O
Christ O
. O

That O
glory O
will O
continue O
forever O
. O

All O
power O
is O
his O
forever O
. O

Amen O
. O

Silas O
will O
bring O
this O
letter O
to O
you O
. O

I O
know O
that O
he O
is O
a O
faithful O
brother O
in O
Christ O
. O

I O
wrote O
this O
short O
letter O
to O
encourage O
you O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
tell O
you O
that O
this O
is O
the O
true O
grace O
of O
God O
. O

Stand O
strong O
in O
that O
grace O
. O

The O
church O
in O
Babylon O
sends O
you O
greetings O
. O

They O
were O
chosen O
just O
as O
you O
were O
. O

Mark O
, O
my O
son O
in O
Christ O
, O
also O
sends O
his O
greetings O
. O

Give O
each O
other O
a O
special O
greeting O
of O
love O
when O
you O
meet O
. O

Peace O
to O
all O
of O
you O
who O
are O
in O
Christ O
. O

Christ O
suffered O
while O
he O
was O
in O
his O
body O
. O

So O
you O
should O
strengthen O
yourselves O
with O
the O
same O
kind O
of O
thinking O
Christ O
had O
. O

The O
one O
who O
accepts O
suffering O
in O
this O
life O
has O
clearly O
decided O
to O
stop O
sinning O
. O

Strengthen O
yourselves O
so O
that O
you O
will O
live O
your O
lives O
here O
on O
earth O
doing O
what O
God O
wants O
, O
not O
the O
evil O
things O
that O
people O
want O
to O
do O
. O

In O
the O
past O
you O
wasted O
too O
much O
time O
doing O
what O
those O
who O
do O
n't O
know O
God O
like O
to O
do O
. O

You O
were O
living O
immoral O
lives O
, O
doing O
the O
evil O
things O
you O
wanted O
to O
do O
. O

You O
were O
always O
getting O
drunk O
, O
having O
wild O
drinking O
parties O
, O
and O
doing O
shameful O
things O
in O
your O
worship O
of O
idols O
. O

Now O
those O
`` O
friends O
'' O
think O
it O
is O
strange O
that O
you O
no O
longer O
join O
them O
in O
all O
the O
wild O
and O
wasteful O
things O
they O
do O
. O

And O
so O
they O
say O
bad O
things O
about O
you O
. O

But O
they O
will O
have O
to O
face O
God O
to O
explain O
what O
they O
have O
done O
. O

He O
is O
the O
one O
who O
will O
soon O
judge O
everyone O
-- O
those O
who O
are O
still O
living O
and O
those O
who O
have O
died O
. O

Some O
were O
told O
the O
Good O
News O
before O
they O
died O
. O

They O
were O
criticized O
by O
others O
in O
their O
life O
here O
on O
earth O
. O

But O
it O
was O
God O
's O
plan O
that O
they O
hear O
the O
Good O
News O
so O
that O
they O
could O
have O
a O
new O
life O
through O
the O
Spirit O
. O

The O
time O
is O
near O
when O
all O
things O
will O
end O
. O

So O
keep O
your O
minds O
clear O
, O
and O
control O
yourselves O
. O

This O
will O
help O
you O
in O
your O
prayers O
. O

Most O
important O
of O
all O
, O
love O
each O
other O
deeply O
, O
because O
love O
makes O
you O
willing O
to O
forgive O
many O
sins O
. O

Open O
your O
homes O
to O
each O
other O
and O
share O
your O
food O
without O
complaining O
. O

God O
has O
shown O
you O
his O
grace O
in O
many O
different O
ways O
. O

So O
be O
good O
servants O
and O
use O
whatever O
gift O
he O
has O
given O
you O
in O
a O
way O
that O
will O
best O
serve O
each O
other O
. O

If O
your O
gift O
is O
speaking O
, O
your O
words O
should O
be O
like O
words O
from O
God O
. O

If O
your O
gift O
is O
serving O
, O
you O
should O
serve O
with O
the O
strength O
that O
God O
gives O
. O

Then O
it O
is O
God O
who O
will O
be O
praised O
in O
everything O
through O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

Power O
and O
glory O
belong O
to O
him O
forever O
and O
ever O
. O

Amen O
. O

My O
friends O
, O
do O
n't O
be O
surprised O
at O
the O
painful O
things O
that O
you O
are O
now O
suffering O
, O
which O
are O
testing O
your O
faith O
. O

Do O
n't O
think O
that O
something O
strange O
is O
happening O
to O
you O
. O

But O
you O
should O
be O
happy O
that O
you O
are O
sharing O
in O
Christ O
's O
sufferings O
. O

You O
will O
be O
happy O
and O
full O
of O
joy O
when O
Christ O
shows O
his O
glory O
. O

When O
people O
say O
bad O
things O
to O
you O
because O
you O
follow O
Christ O
, O
consider O
it O
a O
blessing O
. O

When O
that O
happens O
, O
it O
shows O
that O
God O
's O
Spirit O
, O
the O
Spirit O
of O
glory O
, O
is O
with O
you O
. O

You O
may O
suffer O
, O
but O
do O
n't O
let O
it O
be O
because O
you O
murder O
, O
steal O
, O
make O
trouble O
, O
or O
try O
to O
control O
other O
people O
's O
lives O
. O

But O
if O
you O
suffer O
because O
you O
are O
a O
`` O
Christ O
- O

follower O
, O
'' O
do O
n't O
be O
ashamed O
. O

You O
should O
praise O
God O
for O
that O
name O
. O

It O
is O
time O
for O
judging O
to O
begin O
. O

That O
judging O
will O
begin O
with O
God O
's O
family O
. O

If O
it O
begins O
with O
us O
, O
then O
what O
will O
happen O
to O
those O
who O
do O
n't O
accept O
the O
Good O
News O
of O
God O
? O

`` O
If O
it O
is O
hard O
for O
even O
a O
good O
person O
to O
be O
saved O
, O
what O
will O
happen O
to O
the O
one O
who O
is O
against O
God O
and O
full O
of O
sin O
? O
'' O

So O
if O
God O
wants O
you O
to O
suffer O
, O
you O
should O
trust O
your O
lives O
to O
him O
. O

He O
is O
the O
one O
who O
made O
you O
, O
and O
you O
can O
trust O
him O
. O

So O
continue O
to O
do O
good O
. O

In O
the O
same O
way O
, O
you O
wives O
should O
be O
willing O
to O
serve O
your O
husbands O
. O

Then O
, O
even O
those O
who O
have O
refused O
to O
accept O
God O
's O
teaching O
will O
be O
persuaded O
to O
believe O
because O
of O
the O
way O
you O
live O
. O

You O
will O
not O
need O
to O
say O
anything O
. O

Your O
husbands O
will O
see O
the O
pure O
lives O
that O
you O
live O
with O
respect O
for O
God O
. O

It O
is O
not O
fancy O
hair O
, O
gold O
jewelry O
, O
or O
fine O
clothes O
that O
should O
make O
you O
beautiful O
. O

No O
, O
your O
beauty O
should O
come O
from O
inside O
you O
-- O
the O
beauty O
of O
a O
gentle O
and O
quiet O
spirit O
. O

That O
beauty O
will O
never O
disappear O
. O

It O
is O
worth O
very O
much O
to O
God O
. O

It O
was O
the O
same O
with O
the O
holy O
women O
who O
lived O
long O
ago O
and O
followed O
God O
. O

They O
made O
themselves O
beautiful O
in O
that O
same O
way O
. O

They O
were O
willing O
to O
serve O
their O
husbands O
. O

I O
am O
talking O
about O
women O
like O
Sarah O
. O

She O
obeyed O
Abraham O
, O
her O
husband O
, O
and O
called O
him O
her O
master O
. O

And O
you O
women O
are O
true O
children O
of O
Sarah O
if O
you O
always O
do O
what O
is O
right O
and O
are O
not O
afraid O
. O

In O
the O
same O
way O
, O
you O
husbands O
should O
live O
with O
your O
wives O
in O
an O
understanding O
way O
, O
since O
they O
are O
weaker O
than O
you O
. O

You O
should O
show O
them O
respect O
, O
because O
God O
gives O
them O
the O
same O
blessing O
he O
gives O
you O
-- O
the O
grace O
of O
true O
life O
. O

Do O
this O
so O
that O
nothing O
will O
stop O
your O
prayers O
from O
being O
heard O
. O

So O
all O
of O
you O
should O
live O
together O
in O
peace O
. O

Try O
to O
understand O
each O
other O
. O

Love O
each O
other O
like O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
. O

Be O
kind O
and O
humble O
. O

Do O
n't O
do O
wrong O
to O
anyone O
to O
pay O
them O
back O
for O
doing O
wrong O
to O
you O
. O

Or O
do O
n't O
insult O
anyone O
to O
pay O
them O
back O
for O
insulting O
you O
. O

But O
ask O
God O
to O
bless O
them O
. O

Do O
this O
because O
you O
yourselves O
were O
chosen O
to O
receive O
a O
blessing O
. O

The O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
If O
you O
want O
to O
enjoy O
true O
life O
and O
have O
only O
good O
days O
, O
then O
avoid O
saying O
anything O
hurtful O
, O
and O
never O
let O
a O
lie O
come O
out O
of O
your O
mouth O
. O

Stop O
doing O
what O
is O
wrong O
, O
and O
do O
good O
. O

Look O
for O
peace O
, O
and O
do O
all O
you O
can O
to O
help O
people O
live O
peacefully O
. O

The O
Lord O
watches O
over O
those O
who O
do O
what O
is O
right O
, O
and O
he O
listens O
to O
their O
prayers O
. O

But O
he O
is O
against O
those O
who O
do O
evil O
. O
'' O

If O
you O
are O
always O
trying O
to O
do O
good O
, O
no O
one O
can O
really O
harm O
you O
. O

But O
you O
may O
suffer O
for O
doing O
right O
. O

If O
that O
happens O
, O
you O
have O
God O
's O
blessing O
. O

`` O
Do O
n't O
be O
afraid O
of O
the O
people O
who O
make O
you O
suffer O
; O
do O
n't O
be O
worried O
. O
'' O

But O
keep O
the O
Lord O
Christ O
holy O
in O
your O
hearts O
. O

Always O
be O
ready O
to O
answer O
everyone O
who O
asks O
you O
to O
explain O
about O
the O
hope O
you O
have O
. O

But O
answer O
them O
in O
a O
gentle O
way O
with O
respect O
. O

Keep O
your O
conscience O
clear O
. O

Then O
people O
will O
see O
the O
good O
way O
you O
live O
as O
followers O
of O
Christ O
, O
and O
those O
who O
say O
bad O
things O
about O
you O
will O
be O
ashamed O
of O
what O
they O
said O
. O

It O
is O
better O
to O
suffer O
for O
doing O
good O
than O
for O
doing O
wrong O
. O

Yes O
, O
it O
is O
better O
if O
that O
is O
what O
God O
wants O
. O

Christ O
himself O
suffered O
when O
he O
died O
for O
you O
, O
and O
with O
that O
one O
death O
he O
paid O
for O
your O
sins O
. O

He O
was O
not O
guilty O
, O
but O
he O
died O
for O
people O
who O
are O
guilty O
. O

He O
did O
this O
to O
bring O
all O
of O
you O
to O
God O
. O

In O
his O
physical O
form O
he O
was O
killed O
, O
but O
he O
was O
made O
alive O
by O
the O
Spirit O
. O

And O
by O
the O
Spirit O
he O
went O
and O
preached O
to O
the O
spirits O
in O
prison O
. O

Those O
were O
the O
spirits O
who O
refused O
to O
obey O
God O
long O
ago O
in O
the O
time O
of O
Noah O
. O

God O
was O
waiting O
patiently O
for O
people O
while O
Noah O
was O
building O
the O
big O
boat O
. O

And O
only O
a O
few O
-- O
eight O
in O
all O
-- O
were O
saved O
in O
the O
boat O
through O
the O
floodwater O
. O

And O
that O
water O
is O
like O
baptism O
, O
which O
now O
saves O
you O
. O

Baptism O
is O
not O
the O
washing O
of O
dirt O
from O
the O
body O
. O

It O
is O
asking O
God O
for O
a O
clean O
conscience O
. O

It O
saves O
you O
because O
Jesus O
Christ O
was O
raised O
from O
death O
. O

Now O
he O
has O
gone O
into O
heaven O
. O

He O
is O
at O
God O
's O
right O
side O
and O
rules O
over O
angels O
, O
authorities O
, O
and O
powers O
. O

Greetings O
from O
Peter O
, O
an O
apostle O
of O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

To O
God O
's O
chosen O
people O
who O
are O
away O
from O
their O
homes O
-- O
people O
scattered O
all O
over O
the O
areas O
of O
Pontus O
, O
Galatia O
, O
Cappadocia O
, O
Asia O
, O
and O
Bithynia O
. O

God O
planned O
long O
ago O
to O
choose O
you O
and O
to O
make O
you O
his O
holy O
people O
, O
which O
is O
the O
Spirit O
's O
work O
. O

God O
wanted O
you O
to O
obey O
him O
and O
to O
be O
made O
clean O
by O
the O
blood O
sacrifice O
of O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

I O
pray O
that O
you O
will O
enjoy O
more O
and O
more O
of O
God O
's O
grace O
and O
peace O
. O

Praise O
be O
to O
the O
God O
and O
Father O
of O
our O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

God O
has O
great O
mercy O
, O
and O
because O
of O
his O
mercy O
he O
gave O
us O
a O
new O
life O
. O

This O
new O
life O
brings O
us O
a O
living O
hope O
through O
Jesus O
Christ O
's O
resurrection O
from O
death O
. O

Now O
we O
wait O
to O
receive O
the O
blessings O
God O
has O
for O
his O
children O
. O

These O
blessings O
are O
kept O
for O
you O
in O
heaven O
. O

They O
can O
not O
be O
ruined O
or O
be O
destroyed O
or O
lose O
their O
beauty O
. O

God O
's O
power O
protects O
you O
through O
your O
faith O
, O
and O
it O
keeps O
you O
safe O
until O
your O
salvation O
comes O
. O

That O
salvation O
is O
ready O
to O
be O
given O
to O
you O
at O
the O
end O
of O
time O
. O

I O
know O
the O
thought O
of O
that O
is O
exciting O
, O
even O
if O
you O
must O
suffer O
through O
different O
kinds O
of O
troubles O
for O
a O
short O
time O
now O
. O

These O
troubles O
test O
your O
faith O
and O
prove O
that O
it O
is O
pure O
. O

And O
such O
faith O
is O
worth O
more O
than O
gold O
. O

Gold O
can O
be O
proved O
to O
be O
pure O
by O
fire O
, O
but O
gold O
will O
ruin O
. O

When O
your O
faith O
is O
proven O
to O
be O
pure O
, O
the O
result O
will O
be O
praise O
and O
glory O
and O
honor O
when O
Jesus O
Christ O
comes O
. O

You O
have O
not O
seen O
Christ O
, O
but O
still O
you O
love O
him O
. O

You O
ca O
n't O
see O
him O
now O
, O
but O
you O
believe O
in O
him O
. O

You O
are O
filled O
with O
a O
wonderful O
and O
heavenly O
joy O
that O
can O
not O
be O
explained O
. O

Your O
faith O
has O
a O
goal O
, O
and O
you O
are O
reaching O
that O
goal O
-- O
your O
salvation O
. O

The O
prophets O
studied O
carefully O
and O
tried O
to O
learn O
about O
this O
salvation O
. O

They O
spoke O
about O
the O
grace O
that O
was O
coming O
to O
you O
. O

The O
Spirit O
of O
Christ O
was O
in O
those O
prophets O
. O

And O
the O
Spirit O
was O
telling O
about O
the O
sufferings O
that O
would O
happen O
to O
Christ O
and O
about O
the O
glory O
that O
would O
come O
after O
those O
sufferings O
. O

The O
prophets O
tried O
to O
learn O
about O
what O
the O
Spirit O
was O
showing O
them O
-- O
when O
it O
would O
happen O
and O
what O
the O
world O
would O
be O
like O
at O
that O
time O
. O

It O
was O
made O
clear O
to O
them O
that O
their O
service O
was O
not O
for O
themselves O
. O

They O
were O
serving O
you O
when O
they O
told O
about O
the O
things O
you O
have O
now O
heard O
. O

You O
heard O
them O
from O
those O
who O
told O
you O
the O
Good O
News O
with O
the O
help O
of O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
sent O
from O
heaven O
. O

Even O
the O
angels O
would O
like O
very O
much O
to O
know O
more O
about O
these O
things O
you O
were O
told O
. O

So O
prepare O
your O
minds O
for O
service O
. O

With O
complete O
self O
- O
control O
put O
all O
your O
hope O
in O
the O
grace O
that O
will O
be O
yours O
when O
Jesus O
Christ O
comes O
. O

In O
the O
past O
you O
did O
not O
have O
the O
understanding O
you O
have O
now O
, O
so O
you O
did O
the O
evil O
things O
you O
wanted O
to O
do O
. O

But O
now O
you O
are O
children O
of O
God O
, O
so O
you O
should O
obey O
him O
and O
not O
live O
the O
way O
you O
did O
before O
. O

Be O
holy O
in O
everything O
you O
do O
, O
just O
as O
God O
is O
holy O
. O

He O
is O
the O
one O
who O
chose O
you O
. O

In O
the O
Scriptures O
God O
says O
, O
`` O
Be O
holy O
, O
because O
I O
am O
holy O
. O
'' O

You O
pray O
to O
God O
and O
call O
him O
Father O
, O
but O
he O
will O
judge O
everyone O
the O
same O
way O
-- O
by O
what O
they O
do O
. O

So O
while O
you O
are O
visiting O
here O
on O
earth O
, O
you O
should O
live O
with O
respect O
for O
God O
. O

You O
know O
that O
in O
the O
past O
the O
way O
you O
were O
living O
was O
useless O
. O

It O
was O
a O
way O
of O
life O
you O
learned O
from O
those O
who O
lived O
before O
you O
. O

But O
you O
were O
saved O
from O
that O
way O
of O
living O
. O

You O
were O
bought O
, O
but O
not O
with O
things O
that O
ruin O
like O
gold O
or O
silver O
. O

You O
were O
bought O
with O
the O
precious O
blood O
of O
Christ O
's O
death O
. O

He O
was O
a O
pure O
and O
perfect O
sacrificial O
Lamb O
. O

Christ O
was O
chosen O
before O
the O
world O
was O
made O
, O
but O
he O
was O
shown O
to O
the O
world O
in O
these O
last O
times O
for O
you O
. O

You O
believe O
in O
God O
through O
Christ O
. O

God O
is O
the O
one O
who O
raised O
him O
from O
death O
and O
gave O
honor O
to O
him O
. O

So O
your O
faith O
and O
your O
hope O
are O
in O
God O
. O

You O
have O
made O
yourselves O
pure O
by O
obeying O
the O
truth O
. O

Now O
you O
can O
have O
true O
love O
for O
your O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
. O

So O
love O
each O
other O
deeply O
-- O
with O
all O
your O
heart O
. O

You O
have O
been O
born O
again O
. O

This O
new O
life O
did O
not O
come O
from O
something O
that O
dies O
. O

It O
came O
from O
something O
that O
can O
not O
die O
. O

You O
were O
born O
again O
through O
God O
's O
life O
- O
giving O
message O
that O
lasts O
forever O
. O

The O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
Our O
lives O
are O
like O
the O
grass O
of O
spring O
, O
and O
any O
glory O
we O
enjoy O
is O
like O
the O
beauty O
of O
a O
wildflower O
. O

The O
grass O
dries O
up O
and O
dies O
, O
and O
the O
flower O
falls O
to O
the O
ground O
. O

But O
the O
word O
of O
the O
Lord O
lasts O
forever O
. O
'' O

And O
that O
word O
is O
the O
Good O
News O
that O
was O
told O
to O
you O
. O

In O
the O
past O
there O
were O
false O
prophets O
among O
God O
's O
people O
. O

It O
is O
the O
same O
now O
. O

You O
will O
have O
some O
false O
teachers O
in O
your O
group O
. O

They O
will O
teach O
things O
that O
are O
wrong O
-- O
ideas O
that O
will O
cause O
people O
to O
be O
lost O
. O

And O
they O
will O
teach O
in O
a O
way O
that O
will O
be O
hard O
for O
you O
to O
see O
that O
they O
are O
wrong O
. O

They O
will O
even O
refuse O
to O
follow O
the O
Master O
who O
bought O
their O
freedom O
. O

And O
so O
they O
will O
quickly O
destroy O
themselves O
. O

Many O
people O
will O
follow O
them O
in O
the O
morally O
wrong O
things O
they O
do O
. O

And O
because O
of O
them O
, O
others O
will O
say O
bad O
things O
about O
the O
way O
of O
truth O
we O
follow O
. O

These O
false O
teachers O
only O
want O
your O
money O
. O

So O
they O
will O
use O
you O
by O
telling O
you O
things O
that O
are O
not O
true O
. O

But O
the O
judgment O
against O
these O
false O
teachers O
has O
been O
ready O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

And O
they O
will O
not O
escape O
God O
who O
will O
destroy O
them O
. O

When O
angels O
sinned O
, O
God O
did O
not O
let O
them O
go O
free O
without O
punishment O
. O

He O
sent O
them O
to O
hell O
. O

He O
put O
those O
angels O
in O
caves O
of O
darkness O
, O
where O
they O
are O
being O
held O
until O
the O
time O
when O
God O
will O
judge O
them O
. O

And O
God O
punished O
the O
evil O
people O
who O
lived O
long O
ago O
. O

He O
brought O
a O
flood O
to O
the O
world O
that O
was O
full O
of O
people O
who O
were O
against O
God O
. O

But O
he O
saved O
Noah O
and O
seven O
other O
people O
with O
him O
. O

Noah O
was O
a O
man O
who O
told O
people O
about O
living O
right O
. O

God O
also O
punished O
the O
evil O
cities O
of O
Sodom O
and O
Gomorrah O
. O

He O
burned O
them O
until O
there O
was O
nothing O
left O
but O
ashes O
. O

He O
used O
those O
cities O
as O
an O
example O
of O
what O
will O
happen O
to O
people O
who O
are O
against O
God O
. O

But O
he O
saved O
Lot O
, O
a O
good O
man O
who O
lived O
there O
. O

Lot O
was O
greatly O
troubled O
by O
the O
morally O
bad O
lives O
of O
those O
evil O
people O
. O

This O
good O
man O
lived O
with O
those O
evil O
people O
every O
day O
, O
and O
his O
good O
heart O
was O
hurt O
by O
the O
evil O
things O
he O
saw O
and O
heard O
. O

So O
you O
see O
that O
the O
Lord O
God O
knows O
how O
to O
save O
those O
who O
are O
devoted O
to O
him O
. O

He O
will O
save O
them O
when O
troubles O
come O
. O

And O
the O
Lord O
will O
hold O
evil O
people O
to O
punish O
them O
on O
the O
day O
of O
judgment O
. O

That O
punishment O
is O
for O
those O
who O
are O
always O
doing O
the O
evil O
that O
their O
sinful O
selves O
want O
to O
do O
. O

It O
is O
for O
those O
who O
hate O
the O
Lord O
's O
authority O
. O

These O
false O
teachers O
do O
whatever O
they O
want O
, O
and O
they O
are O
so O
proud O
of O
themselves O
. O

They O
are O
not O
afraid O
even O
to O
say O
bad O
things O
against O
the O
glorious O
ones O
. O

The O
angels O
are O
much O
stronger O
and O
more O
powerful O
than O
these O
beings O
. O

But O
even O
the O
angels O
do O
n't O
accuse O
them O
and O
say O
bad O
things O
about O
them O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

But O
these O
false O
teachers O
speak O
evil O
against O
what O
they O
do O
n't O
understand O
. O

They O
are O
like O
animals O
that O
do O
things O
without O
really O
thinking O
-- O
like O
wild O
animals O
that O
are O
born O
to O
be O
caught O
and O
killed O
. O

And O
, O
like O
wild O
animals O
, O
they O
will O
be O
destroyed O
. O

They O
have O
made O
many O
people O
suffer O
. O

So O
they O
themselves O
will O
suffer O
. O

That O
is O
their O
pay O
for O
what O
they O
have O
done O
. O

They O
think O
it O
is O
fun O
to O
do O
evil O
where O
everyone O
can O
see O
them O
. O

They O
enjoy O
the O
evil O
things O
that O
please O
them O
. O

So O
they O
are O
like O
dirty O
spots O
and O
stains O
among O
you O
-- O
they O
bring O
shame O
to O
you O
in O
the O
meals O
you O
eat O
together O
. O

Every O
time O
they O
look O
at O
a O
woman O
, O
they O
want O
her O
. O

They O
are O
always O
sinning O
this O
way O
. O

And O
they O
lead O
weaker O
people O
into O
the O
trap O
of O
sin O
. O

They O
have O
taught O
themselves O
well O
to O
be O
greedy O
. O

They O
are O
under O
a O
curse O
. O

These O
false O
teachers O
left O
the O
right O
way O
and O
went O
the O
wrong O
way O
. O

They O
followed O
the O
same O
way O
that O
the O
prophet O
Balaam O
went O
. O

He O
was O
the O
son O
of O
Beor O
, O
who O
loved O
being O
paid O
for O
doing O
wrong O
. O

But O
a O
donkey O
told O
him O
that O
he O
was O
doing O
wrong O
. O

A O
donkey O
can O
not O
talk O
, O
of O
course O
, O
but O
that O
donkey O
spoke O
with O
a O
man O
's O
voice O
and O
stopped O
the O
prophet O
from O
acting O
so O
crazy O
. O

These O
false O
teachers O
are O
like O
springs O
that O
have O
no O
water O
. O

They O
are O
like O
clouds O
that O
are O
blown O
by O
a O
storm O
. O

A O
place O
in O
the O
deepest O
darkness O
has O
been O
kept O
for O
them O
. O

They O
boast O
with O
words O
that O
mean O
nothing O
. O

They O
lead O
people O
into O
the O
trap O
of O
sin O
. O

They O
find O
people O
who O
have O
just O
escaped O
from O
a O
wrong O
way O
of O
life O
and O
lead O
them O
back O
into O
sin O
. O

They O
do O
this O
by O
using O
the O
evil O
things O
people O
want O
to O
do O
in O
their O
human O
weakness O
. O

These O
false O
teachers O
promise O
those O
people O
freedom O
, O
but O
they O
themselves O
are O
not O
free O
. O

They O
are O
slaves O
to O
a O
mind O
that O
has O
been O
ruined O
by O
sin O
. O

Yes O
, O
people O
are O
slaves O
to O
anything O
that O
controls O
them O
. O

People O
can O
be O
made O
free O
from O
the O
evil O
in O
the O
world O
. O

They O
can O
be O
made O
free O
by O
knowing O
our O
Lord O
and O
Savior O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

But O
if O
they O
go O
back O
into O
those O
evil O
things O
and O
are O
controlled O
by O
them O
, O
then O
it O
is O
worse O
for O
them O
than O
it O
was O
before O
. O

Yes O
, O
it O
would O
be O
better O
for O
them O
to O
have O
never O
known O
the O
right O
way O
. O

That O
would O
be O
better O
than O
to O
know O
the O
right O
way O
and O
then O
to O
turn O
away O
from O
the O
holy O
teaching O
that O
was O
given O
to O
them O
. O

What O
they O
did O
is O
like O
these O
true O
sayings O
: O
`` O
A O
dog O
vomits O
and O
goes O
back O
to O
what O
it O
threw O
up O
. O
'' O

And O
, O
`` O
After O
a O
pig O
is O
washed O
, O
it O
goes O
back O
and O
rolls O
in O
the O
mud O
again O

'' O

My O
friends O
, O
this O
is O
the O
second O
letter O
I O
have O
written O
to O
you O
. O

I O
wrote O
both O
letters O
to O
you O
to O
help O
your O
honest O
minds O
remember O
something O
. O

I O
want O
you O
to O
remember O
the O
words O
that O
the O
holy O
prophets O
spoke O
in O
the O
past O
. O

And O
remember O
the O
command O
that O
our O
Lord O
and O
Savior O
gave O
us O
. O

He O
gave O
us O
that O
command O
through O
your O
apostles O
. O

It O
is O
important O
for O
you O
to O
understand O
what O
will O
happen O
in O
the O
last O
days O
. O

People O
will O
laugh O
at O
you O

They O
will O
live O
following O
the O
evil O
they O
want O
to O
do O

They O
will O
say O
, O
`` O
Jesus O
promised O
to O
come O
again O

Where O
is O
he O
? O

Our O
fathers O
have O
died O

but O
the O
world O
continues O
the O
way O
it O
has O
been O
since O
it O
was O
made O
. O
'' O

But O
these O
people O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
remember O
what O
happened O
long O
ago O
. O

The O
skies O
were O
there O
, O
and O
God O
made O
the O
earth O
from O
water O
and O
with O
water O
. O

All O
this O
happened O
by O
God O
's O
word O
. O

Then O
the O
world O
was O
flooded O
and O
destroyed O
with O
water O
. O

And O
that O
same O
word O
of O
God O
is O
keeping O
the O
skies O
and O
the O
earth O
that O
we O
have O
now O
. O

They O
are O
being O
kept O
to O
be O
destroyed O
by O
fire O
. O

They O
are O
kept O
for O
the O
day O
of O
judgment O
and O
the O
destruction O
of O
all O
people O
who O
are O
against O
God O
. O

But O
do O
n't O
forget O
this O
one O
thing O
, O
dear O
friends O
: O
To O
the O
Lord O
a O
day O
is O
like O
a O
thousand O
years O
, O
and O
a O
thousand O
years O
is O
like O
a O
day O
. O

The O
Lord O
is O
not O
being O
slow O
in O
doing O
what O
he O
promised O
-- O
the O
way O
some O
people O
understand O
slowness O
. O

But O
God O
is O
being O
patient O
with O
you O
. O

He O
does O
n't O
want O
anyone O
to O
be O
lost O
. O

He O
wants O
everyone O
to O
change O
their O
ways O
and O
stop O
sinning O
. O

But O
the O
day O
when O
the O
Lord O
comes O
again O
will O
surprise O
everyone O
like O
the O
coming O
of O
a O
thief O
. O

The O
sky O
will O
disappear O
with O
a O
loud O
noise O
. O

Everything O
in O
the O
sky O
will O
be O
destroyed O
with O
fire O
. O

And O
the O
earth O
and O
everything O
in O
it O
will O
be O
burned O
up O
. O

Everything O
will O
be O
destroyed O
in O
this O
way O
. O

So O
what O
kind O
of O
people O
should O
you O
be O
? O

Your O
lives O
should O
be O
holy O
and O
devoted O
to O
God O
. O

You O
should O
be O
looking O
forward O
to O
the O
day O
of O
God O
, O
wanting O
more O
than O
anything O
else O
for O
it O
to O
come O
soon O
. O

When O
it O
comes O
, O
the O
sky O
will O
be O
destroyed O
with O
fire O
, O
and O
everything O
in O
the O
sky O
will O
melt O
with O
heat O
. O

But O
God O
made O
a O
promise O
to O
us O
. O

And O
we O
are O
waiting O
for O
what O
he O
promised O
-- O
a O
new O
sky O
and O
a O
new O
earth O
. O

That O
will O
be O
the O
place O
where O
goodness O
lives O
. O

Dear O
friends O
, O
we O
are O
waiting O
for O
this O
to O
happen O
. O

So O
try O
as O
hard O
as O
you O
can O
to O
be O
without O
sin O
and O
without O
fault O
. O

Try O
to O
be O
at O
peace O
with O
God O
. O

Remember O
that O
we O
are O
saved O
because O
our O
Lord O
is O
patient O
. O

Our O
dear O
brother O
Paul O
told O
you O
that O
same O
thing O
when O
he O
wrote O
to O
you O
with O
the O
wisdom O
that O
God O
gave O
him O
. O

That O
's O
what O
he O
says O
in O
all O
his O
letters O
when O
he O
writes O
about O
these O
things O
. O

There O
are O
parts O
of O
his O
letters O
that O
are O
hard O
to O
understand O
, O
and O
some O
people O
give O
a O
wrong O
meaning O
to O
them O
. O

These O
people O
are O
ignorant O
and O
weak O
in O
faith O
. O

They O
also O
give O
wrong O
meanings O
to O
the O
other O
Scriptures O
. O

But O
they O
are O
destroying O
themselves O
by O
doing O
that O
. O

Dear O
friends O
, O
you O
already O
know O
about O
this O
. O

So O
be O
careful O
. O

Do O
n't O
let O
these O
evil O
people O
lead O
you O
away O
by O
the O
wrong O
they O
do O
. O

Be O
careful O
that O
you O
do O
not O
fall O
from O
your O
strong O
faith O
. O

But O
grow O
in O
the O
grace O
and O
knowledge O
of O
our O
Lord O

Glory O

all O
of O
you O

share O
in O
the O
same O
valuable O
faith O

we O
have O

This O
faith O
was O
given O

Grace O

his O

everything O
we O
need O

live O
a O
life O
devoted O

We O
have O
these O
things O

we O
know O
him O

chose O
us O
by O
his O
glory O

goodness O

through O
which O
he O

the O
very O
great O

rich O
gifts O
that O
he O

With O
these O
gifts O
you O
can O
share O
in O
being O
like O
God O
. O

And O
so O
you O
will O
escape O
the O
ruin O
that O
comes O
to O
people O
in O
the O
world O
because O
of O
the O
evil O
things O
they O
want O
. O

Because O
you O
have O
these O
blessings O
, O
do O
all O
you O
can O
to O
add O
to O
your O
life O
these O
things O
: O

your O

toward O
your O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
in O
Christ O
, O
and O
to O
this O
kindness O
add O
love O

If O
all O
these O
things O
are O
in O
you O
and O
growing O
, O
you O
will O
never O
fail O
to O
be O
useful O
to O
God O
. O

You O
will O
produce O
the O
kind O
of O
fruit O
that O
should O
come O
from O
your O
knowledge O
of O
our O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

But O
those O
who O
do O
n't O
grow O
in O
these O
blessings O
are O
blind O
. O

They O
can O
not O
see O
clearly O
what O
they O
have O
. O

They O
have O
forgotten O
that O
they O
were O
cleansed O
from O
their O
past O
sins O
. O

My O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
God O
called O
you O
and O
chose O
you O
to O
be O
his O
. O

Do O
your O
best O
to O
live O
in O
a O
way O
that O
shows O
you O
really O
are O
God O
's O
called O
and O
chosen O
people O
. O

If O
you O
do O
all O
this O
, O
you O
will O
never O
fall O
. O

And O
you O
will O
be O
given O
a O
very O
great O
welcome O
into O
the O
kingdom O
of O
our O
Lord O
and O
Savior O
Jesus O
Christ O
, O
a O
kingdom O
that O
never O
ends O
. O

You O
already O
know O
these O
things O
. O

You O
are O
very O
strong O
in O
the O
truth O
you O
have O
. O

But O
I O
am O
always O
going O
to O
help O
you O
remember O
them O
. O

While O
I O
am O
still O
living O
here O
on O
earth O
, O
I O
think O
it O
is O
right O
for O
me O
to O
remind O
you O
of O
them O
. O

I O
know O
that O
I O
must O
soon O
leave O
this O
body O
. O

Our O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
has O
shown O
me O
that O
. O

I O
will O
try O
my O
best O
to O
make O
sure O
you O
remember O
these O
things O
even O
after O
I O
am O
gone O
. O

We O
told O
you O
about O
the O
power O
of O
our O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

We O
told O
you O
about O
his O
coming O
. O

The O
things O
we O
told O
you O
were O
not O
just O
clever O
stories O
that O
people O
invented O
. O

No O
, O
we O
saw O
the O
greatness O
of O
Jesus O
with O
our O
own O
eyes O
. O

Jesus O
heard O
the O
voice O
of O
the O
great O
and O
glorious O
God O
. O

That O
was O
when O
he O
received O
honor O
and O
glory O
from O
God O
the O
Father O
. O

The O
voice O
said O
, O
`` O
This O
is O
my O
Son O
, O
the O
one O
I O
love O
. O

I O
am O
very O
pleased O
with O
him O
. O
'' O

And O
we O
heard O
that O
voice O
. O

It O
came O
from O
heaven O
while O
we O
were O
with O
Jesus O
on O
the O
holy O
mountain O
. O

This O
makes O
us O
more O
sure O
about O
what O
the O
prophets O
said O
. O

And O
it O
is O
good O
for O
you O
to O
follow O
closely O
what O
they O
said O
, O
which O
is O
like O
a O
light O
shining O
in O
a O
dark O
place O
. O

You O
have O
that O
light O
until O
the O
day O
begins O
and O
the O
morning O
star O
brings O
new O
light O
to O
your O
minds O
. O

Most O
important O
of O
all O
, O
you O
must O
understand O
this O
: O
No O
prophecy O
in O
the O
Scriptures O
comes O
from O
the O
prophet O
's O
own O
understanding O
. O

No O
prophecy O
ever O
came O
from O
what O
some O
person O
wanted O
to O
say O
. O

But O
people O
were O
led O
by O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
and O
spoke O
words O
from O
God O
. O

Children O
, O
obey O
your O
parents O
the O
way O
the O
Lord O
wants O
, O
because O
this O
is O
the O
right O
thing O
to O
do O
. O

The O
command O
says O
, O
`` O
You O
must O
respect O
your O
father O
and O
mother O
. O
'' O

That O
is O
the O
first O
command O
that O
has O
a O
promise O
with O
it O
. O

That O
promise O
is O
: O
`` O
Then O
all O
will O
go O
well O
with O
you O
, O
and O
you O
will O
have O
a O
long O
life O
on O
the O
earth O
. O
'' O

Fathers O
, O
do O
n't O
make O
your O
children O
angry O
, O
but O
raise O
them O
with O
the O
kind O
of O
teaching O
and O
training O
you O
learn O
from O
the O
Lord O
. O

Slaves O
, O
obey O
your O
masters O
here O
on O
earth O
with O
fear O
and O
respect O
. O

And O
do O
this O
with O
a O
heart O
that O
is O
true O
, O
just O
as O
you O
obey O
Christ O
. O

You O
must O
do O
this O
not O
just O
to O
please O
your O
masters O
while O
they O
are O
watching O
, O
but O
all O
the O
time O
. O

Since O
you O
are O
really O
slaves O
of O
Christ O
, O
you O
must O
do O
with O
all O
your O
heart O
what O
God O
wants O
. O

Do O
your O
work O
, O
and O
be O
happy O
to O
do O
it O
. O

Work O
as O
though O
it O
is O
the O
Lord O
you O
are O
serving O
, O
not O
just O
an O
earthly O
master O
. O

Remember O
that O
the O
Lord O
will O
give O
everyone O
a O
reward O
for O
doing O
good O
. O

Everyone O
, O
slave O
or O
free O
, O
will O
get O
a O
reward O
for O
the O
good O
things O
they O
do O
. O

Masters O
, O
in O
the O
same O
way O
, O
be O
good O
to O
your O
slaves O
. O

Do O
n't O
say O
things O
to O
scare O
them O
. O

You O
know O
that O
the O
one O
who O
is O
your O
Master O
and O
their O
Master O
is O
in O
heaven O
, O
and O
he O
treats O
everyone O
the O
same O
. O

To O
end O
my O
letter O
I O
tell O
you O
, O
be O
strong O
in O
the O
Lord O
and O
in O
his O
great O
power O
. O

Wear O
the O
full O
armor O
of O
God O
. O

Wear O
God O
's O
armor O
so O
that O
you O
can O
fight O
against O
the O
devil O
's O
clever O
tricks O
. O

Our O
fight O
is O
not O
against O
people O
on O
earth O
. O

We O
are O
fighting O
against O
the O
rulers O
and O
authorities O
and O
the O
powers O
of O
this O
world O
's O
darkness O
. O

We O
are O
fighting O
against O
the O
spiritual O
powers O
of O
evil O
in O
the O
heavenly O
places O
. O

That O
is O
why O
you O
need O
to O
get O
God O
's O
full O
armor O
. O

Then O
on O
the O
day O
of O
evil O
you O
will O
be O
able O
to O
stand O
strong O
. O

And O
when O
you O
have O
finished O
the O
whole O
fight O
, O
you O
will O
still O
be O
standing O
. O

So O
stand O
strong O
with O
the O
belt O
of O
truth O
tied O
around O
your O
waist O
, O
and O
on O
your O
chest O
wear O
the O
protection O
of O
right O
living O
. O

On O
your O
feet O
wear O
the O
Good O
News O
of O
peace O
to O
help O
you O
stand O
strong O
. O

And O
also O
use O
the O
shield O
of O
faith O
with O
which O
you O
can O
stop O
all O
the O
burning O
arrows O
that O
come O
from O
the O
Evil O
One O
. O

Accept O
God O
's O
salvation O
as O
your O
helmet O
. O

And O
take O
the O
sword O
of O
the O
Spirit O
-- O
that O
sword O
is O
the O
teaching O
of O
God O
. O

Pray O

our O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

In O
Christ O
, O
God O
has O
given O
us O
every O
spiritual O
blessing O
in O
heaven O
. O

In O
Christ O
, O
he O
chose O
us O
before O
the O
world O
was O
made O
. O

He O
chose O
us O
in O
love O
to O
be O
his O
holy O
people O
-- O
people O
who O
could O
stand O
before O
him O
without O
any O
fault O
. O

And O
before O
the O
world O
was O
made O
, O
God O
decided O
to O
make O
us O
his O
own O
children O
through O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

This O
was O
what O
God O
wanted O
, O
and O
it O
pleased O
him O
to O
do O
it O
. O

And O
this O
brings O
praise O
to O
God O
because O
of O
his O
wonderful O
grace O
. O

God O
gave O
that O
grace O
to O
us O
freely O
. O

He O
gave O
us O
that O
grace O
in O
Christ O
, O
the O
one O
he O
loves O
. O

In O
Christ O
we O
are O
made O

his O
blood O

. O

We O
have O
forgiveness O
of O
sins O
because O
of O
God O
's O
rich O
grace O
. O

God O
gave O
us O
that O
grace O
fully O
and O
freely O
. O

With O
full O
wisdom O
and O
understanding O
he O
let O
us O
know O
his O
secret O
plan O
. O

This O
was O
what O
God O
wanted O
, O
and O
he O
planned O
to O
do O
it O
through O
Christ O
. O

God O
's O
goal O
was O
to O
finish O
his O
plan O
when O
the O
right O
time O
came O
. O

He O
planned O
that O
all O
things O
in O
heaven O
and O
on O
earth O
be O
joined O
together O
with O
Christ O
as O
the O
head O
. O

In O
Christ O
we O
were O
chosen O
to O
be O
God O
's O
people O
. O

God O
had O
already O
planned O
for O
us O
to O
be O
his O
people O
, O
because O
that O
is O
what O
he O
wanted O
. O

And O
he O
is O
the O
one O
who O
makes O
everything O
agree O
with O
what O
he O
decides O
and O
wants O
. O

We O
Jews O
were O
the O
first O
to O
hope O
in O
Christ O
. O

And O
we O
were O
chosen O
so O
that O
we O
would O
bring O
praise O
to O
God O
in O
all O
his O
glory O
. O

It O
is O
the O
same O
with O
you O
. O

You O
heard O
the O
true O
message O
, O
the O
Good O
News O
about O
your O
salvation O
. O

When O
you O
heard O
that O
Good O
News O
, O
you O
believed O
in O
Christ O
. O

And O
in O
Christ O
, O
God O
put O
his O
special O
mark O
on O
you O
by O
giving O
you O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
that O
he O
promised O
. O

The O
Spirit O
is O
the O
first O
payment O
that O
guarantees O
we O
will O
get O
all O
that O
God O
has O
for O
us O
. O

Then O
we O
will O
enjoy O
complete O
freedom O
as O
people O
who O
belong O
to O
him O
. O

The O
goal O
for O
all O
of O
us O
is O
the O
praise O
of O
God O
in O
all O
his O
glory O
. O

That O
is O
why O
I O
always O
remember O
you O
in O
my O
prayers O
and O
thank O
God O
for O
you O
. O

I O
have O
done O
this O
ever O
since O
I O
heard O
about O
your O
faith O
in O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
and O
your O
love O
for O
all O
of O
God O
's O
people O
. O

I O
always O
pray O
to O
the O
great O
and O
glorious O
Father O
, O
the O
God O
of O
our O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

I O
pray O
that O
he O
will O
give O
you O
the O
Spirit O
, O
who O
will O
let O
you O
know O
truths O
about O
God O
and O
help O
you O
understand O
them O
, O
so O
that O
you O
will O
know O
him O
better O
. O

I O
pray O
that O
God O
will O
open O
your O
minds O
to O
see O
his O
truth O
. O

Then O
you O
will O
know O
the O
hope O
that O
he O
has O
chosen O
us O
to O
have O
. O

You O
will O
know O
that O
the O
blessings O
God O
has O
promised O
his O
holy O
people O
are O
rich O
and O
glorious O
. O

And O
you O
will O
know O
that O
God O
's O
power O
is O
very O
great O
for O
us O
who O
believe O
. O

It O
is O
the O
same O
as O
the O
mighty O
power O
he O
used O
to O
raise O
Christ O
from O
death O
and O
put O
him O
at O
his O
right O
side O
in O
the O
heavenly O
places O
. O

He O
put O
Christ O
over O
all O
rulers O
, O
authorities O
, O
powers O
, O
and O
kings O
. O

He O
gave O
him O
authority O
over O
everything O
that O
has O
power O
in O
this O
world O
or O
in O
the O
next O
world O
. O

God O
put O
everything O
under O
Christ O
's O
power O
and O
made O
him O
head O
over O
everything O
for O
the O
church O
. O

The O
church O
is O
Christ O
's O
body O
. O

It O
is O
filled O
with O
him O
. O

He O
makes O
everything O
complete O
in O
every O
way O
. O

In O
the O
past O
you O
were O
spiritually O
dead O
because O
of O
your O
sins O
and O
the O
things O
you O
did O
against O
God O
. O

Yes O
, O
in O
the O
past O
your O
lives O
were O
full O
of O
those O
sins O
. O

You O
lived O
the O
way O
the O
world O
lives O
, O
following O
the O
ruler O
of O
the O
evil O
powers O
over O
the O
earth O
. O

That O
same O
spirit O
is O
now O
working O
in O
those O
who O
refuse O
to O
obey O
God O
. O

In O
the O
past O
all O
of O
us O
lived O
like O
that O
, O
trying O
to O
please O
our O
sinful O
selves O
. O

We O
did O
all O
the O
things O
our O
bodies O
and O
minds O
wanted O
. O

Like O
everyone O
else O
in O
the O
world O
, O
we O
deserved O
to O
suffer O
God O
's O
anger O
just O
because O
of O
the O
way O
we O
were O
. O

But O
God O
is O
rich O
in O
mercy O
, O
and O
he O
loved O
us O
very O
much O
. O

We O
were O
spiritually O
dead O
because O
of O
all O
we O
had O
done O
against O
him O
. O

But O
he O
gave O
us O
new O
life O
together O
with O
Christ O
. O

-LRB- O
You O
have O
been O
saved O
by O
God O
's O
grace O
. O
-RRB- O

Yes O
, O
it O
is O
because O
we O
are O
a O
part O
of O
Christ O
Jesus O
that O
God O
raised O
us O
from O
death O
and O
seated O
us O
together O
with O
him O
in O
the O
heavenly O
places O
. O

God O
did O
this O
so O
that O
his O
kindness O
to O
us O
who O
belong O
to O
Christ O
Jesus O
would O
clearly O
show O
for O
all O
time O
to O
come O
the O
amazing O
richness O
of O
his O
grace O
. O

I O
mean O
that O
you O
have O
been O
saved O
by O
grace O
because O
you O
believed O
. O

You O
did O
not O
save O
yourselves O
; O
it O
was O
a O
gift O
from O
God O
. O

You O
are O
not O
saved O
by O
the O
things O
you O
have O
done O
, O
so O
there O
is O
nothing O
to O
boast O
about O
. O

God O
has O
made O
us O
what O
we O
are O
. O

In O
Christ O
Jesus O
, O
God O
made O
us O
new O
people O
so O
that O
we O
would O
spend O
our O
lives O
doing O
the O
good O
things O
he O
had O
already O
planned O
for O
us O
to O
do O
. O

You O
were O
not O
born O
as O
Jews O
. O

You O
are O
the O
people O
the O
Jews O
call O
`` O
uncircumcised O
. O
'' O

Those O
Jews O
who O
call O
you O
`` O
uncircumcised O
'' O
call O
themselves O
`` O

circumcised O
. O
'' O

-LRB- O
Their O
circumcision O
is O
only O
something O
they O
themselves O
do O
to O
their O
bodies O
. O
-RRB- O

Remember O
that O
in O
the O
past O
you O
were O
without O
Christ O
. O

You O
were O
not O
citizens O
of O
Israel O
, O
and O
you O
did O
not O
know O
about O
the O
agreements O
with O
the O
promises O
that O
God O
made O
to O
his O
people O
. O

You O
had O
no O
hope O
, O
and O
you O
did O
not O
know O
God O
. O

Yes O
, O
at O
one O
time O
you O
were O
far O
away O
from O
God O
, O
but O
now O
in O
Christ O
Jesus O
, O
you O
are O
brought O
near O
to O
him O
. O

You O
are O
brought O
near O
to O
God O
through O
the O
blood O
sacrifice O
of O
Christ O
. O

Christ O
is O
the O
reason O
we O
are O
now O
at O
peace O
. O

He O
made O
us O
Jews O
and O
you O
who O
are O
not O
Jews O
one O
people O
. O

We O
were O
separated O
by O
a O
wall O
of O
hate O
that O
stood O
between O
us O
, O
but O
Christ O
broke O
down O
that O
wall O
. O

By O
giving O
his O
own O
body O
, O
Christ O
ended O
the O
law O
with O
its O
many O
commands O
and O
rules O
. O

His O
purpose O
was O
to O
make O
the O
two O
groups O
become O
one O
in O
him O
. O

By O
doing O
this O
he O
would O
make O
peace O
. O

Through O
the O
cross O
Christ O
ended O
the O
hate O
between O
the O
two O
groups O
. O

And O
after O
they O
became O
one O
body O
, O
he O
wanted O
to O
bring O
them O
both O
back O
to O
God O
. O

He O
did O
this O
with O
his O
death O
on O
the O
cross O
. O

Christ O
came O
and O
brought O
the O
message O
of O
peace O
to O
you O
non-Jews O
who O
were O
far O
away O
from O
God O
. O

And O
he O
brought O
that O
message O
of O
peace O
to O
those O
who O
were O
near O
to O
God O
. O

Yes O
, O
through O
Christ O
we O
all O
have O
the O
right O
to O
come O
to O
the O
Father O
in O
one O
Spirit O
. O

So O
now O
you O
non-Jewish O
people O
are O
not O
visitors O
or O
strangers O
, O
but O
you O
are O
citizens O
together O
with O
God O
's O
holy O
people O
. O

You O
belong O
to O
God O
's O
family O
. O

You O
believers O
are O
like O
a O
building O
that O
God O
owns O
. O

That O
building O
was O
built O
on O
the O
foundation O
that O
the O
apostles O
and O
prophets O
prepared O
. O

Christ O
Jesus O
himself O
is O
the O
most O
important O
stone O
in O
that O
building O
. O

The O
whole O
building O
is O
joined O
together O
in O
Christ O
, O
and O
he O
makes O
it O
grow O
and O
become O
a O
holy O
temple O
in O
the O
Lord O
. O

And O
in O
Christ O
you O
are O
being O
built O
together O
with O
his O
other O
people O
. O

You O
are O
being O
made O
into O
a O
place O
where O
God O
lives O
through O
the O
Spirit O
. O

You O
are O
God O
's O
dear O
children O
, O
so O
try O
to O
be O
like O
him O
. O

Live O
a O
life O
of O
love O
. O

Love O
others O
just O
as O
Christ O
loved O
us O
. O

He O
gave O
himself O
for O
us O
-- O
a O
sweet O
- O
smelling O
offering O
and O
sacrifice O
to O
God O
. O

But O
there O
must O
be O
no O
sexual O
sin O
among O
you O
. O

There O
must O
not O
be O
any O
kind O
of O
evil O
or O
selfishly O
wanting O
more O
and O
more O
, O
because O
such O
things O
are O
not O
right O
for O
God O
's O
holy O
people O
. O

Also O
, O
there O
must O
be O
no O
evil O
talk O
among O
you O
. O

Do O
n't O
say O
things O
that O
are O
foolish O
or O
filthy O
. O

These O
are O
not O
for O
you O
. O

But O
you O
should O
be O
giving O
thanks O
to O
God O
. O

You O
can O
be O
sure O
of O
this O
: O
No O
one O
will O
have O
a O
place O
in O
the O
kingdom O
of O
Christ O
and O
of O
God O
if O
that O
person O
commits O
sexual O
sins O
, O
or O
does O
evil O
things O
, O
or O
is O
a O
person O
who O
selfishly O
wants O
more O
and O
more O
. O

A O
greedy O
person O
like O
that O
is O
serving O
a O
false O
god O
. O

Do O
n't O
let O
anyone O
fool O
you O
with O
words O
that O
are O
not O
true O
. O

God O
gets O
very O
angry O
when O
people O
who O
do O
n't O
obey O
him O
talk O
like O
that O
. O

So O
do O
n't O
have O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
them O
. O

In O
the O
past O
you O
were O
full O
of O
darkness O
, O
but O
now O
you O
are O
full O
of O
light O
in O
the O
Lord O
. O

So O
live O
like O
children O
who O
belong O
to O
the O
light O
. O

This O
light O
produces O
every O
kind O
of O
goodness O
, O
right O
living O
, O
and O
truth O
. O

Try O
to O
learn O
what O
pleases O
the O
Lord O
. O

Have O
no O
part O
in O
the O
things O
that O
people O
in O
darkness O
do O
, O
which O
produce O
nothing O
good O
. O

Instead O
, O
tell O
everyone O
how O
wrong O
those O
things O
are O
. O

It O
is O
really O
very O
shameful O
to O
even O
talk O
about O
the O
things O
those O
people O
do O
in O
secret O
. O

But O
the O
light O
makes O
clear O
how O
wrong O
those O
things O
are O
. O

Yes O
, O
everything O
is O
made O
clear O
by O
the O
light O
. O

This O
is O
why O
we O
say O
, O
`` O
Wake O
up O
, O
you O
who O
are O
sleeping O
! O

Rise O
from O
death O
, O
and O
Christ O
will O
shine O
on O
you O
. O
'' O

So O
be O
very O
careful O
how O
you O
live O
. O

Live O
wisely O
, O
not O
like O
fools O
. O

I O
mean O
that O
you O
should O
use O
every O
opportunity O
you O
have O
for O
doing O
good O
, O
because O
these O
are O
evil O
times O
. O

So O
do O
n't O
be O
foolish O
with O
your O
lives O
, O
but O
learn O
what O
the O
Lord O
wants O
you O
to O
do O
. O

Do O
n't O
be O
drunk O
with O
wine O
, O
which O
will O
ruin O
your O
life O
, O
but O
be O
filled O
with O
the O
Spirit O
. O

Encourage O
each O
other O
with O
psalms O
, O
hymns O
, O
and O
spiritual O
songs O
. O

Sing O
and O
make O
music O
in O
your O
hearts O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

Always O
give O
thanks O
to O
God O
the O
Father O
for O
everything O
in O
the O
name O
of O
our O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

Be O
willing O
to O
serve O
each O
other O
out O
of O
respect O
for O
Christ O
. O

Wives O
, O
be O
willing O
to O
serve O
your O
husbands O
the O
same O
as O
the O
Lord O
. O

A O
husband O
is O
the O
head O
of O
his O
wife O
, O
just O
as O
Christ O
is O
the O
head O
of O
the O
church O
. O

Christ O
is O
the O
Savior O
of O
the O
church O
, O
which O
is O
his O
body O
. O

The O
church O
serves O
under O
Christ O
, O
so O
it O
is O
the O
same O
with O
you O
wives O
. O

You O
should O
be O
willing O
to O
serve O
your O
husbands O
in O
everything O
. O

Husbands O
, O
love O
your O
wives O
the O
same O
as O
Christ O
loved O
the O
church O
and O
gave O
his O
life O
for O
it O
. O

He O
died O
to O
make O
the O
church O
holy O
. O

He O
used O
the O
telling O
of O
the O
Good O
News O
to O
make O
the O
church O
clean O
by O
washing O
it O
with O
water O
. O

Christ O
died O
so O
that O
he O
could O
give O
the O
church O
to O
himself O
like O
a O
bride O
in O
all O
her O
beauty O
. O

He O
died O
so O
that O
the O
church O
could O
be O
holy O
and O
without O
fault O
, O
with O
no O
evil O
or O
sin O
or O
any O
other O
thing O
wrong O
in O
it O
. O

And O
husbands O
should O
love O
their O
wives O
like O
that O
. O

They O
should O
love O
their O
wives O
as O
they O
love O
their O
own O
bodies O
. O

The O
man O
who O
loves O
his O
wife O
loves O
himself O
, O
because O
no O
one O
ever O
hates O
his O
own O
body O
, O
but O
feeds O
and O
takes O
care O
of O
it O
. O

And O
that O
is O
what O
Christ O
does O
for O
the O
church O
because O
we O
are O
parts O
of O
his O
body O
. O

The O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
That O
is O
why O
a O
man O
will O
leave O
his O
father O
and O
mother O
and O
join O
his O
wife O
, O
and O
the O
two O
people O
will O
become O
one O
. O
'' O

That O
secret O
truth O
is O
very O
important O
-- O
I O
am O
talking O
about O
Christ O
and O
the O
church O
. O

But O
each O
one O
of O
you O
must O
love O
his O
wife O
as O
he O
loves O
himself O
. O

And O
a O
wife O
must O
respect O
her O
husband O
. O

So O
I O
, O
Paul O
, O
am O
a O
prisoner O
because O
I O
serve O
Christ O
Jesus O
for O
you O
who O
are O
not O
Jews O
. O

Surely O
you O
know O
that O
God O
gave O
me O
this O
work O
through O
his O
grace O
to O
help O
you O
. O

God O
let O
me O
know O
his O
secret O
plan O
by O
showing O
it O
to O
me O
. O

I O
have O
already O
written O
a O
little O
about O
this O
. O

And O
if O
you O
read O
what O
I O
wrote O
, O
you O
can O
see O
that O
I O
understand O
the O
secret O
truth O
about O
Christ O
. O

People O
who O
lived O
in O
other O
times O
were O
not O
told O
that O
secret O
truth O
. O

But O
now O
, O
through O
the O
Spirit O
, O
God O
has O
made O
it O
known O
to O
his O
holy O
apostles O
and O
prophets O
. O

And O
this O
is O
the O
secret O
truth O
: O
that O
by O
hearing O
the O
Good O
News O
, O
those O
who O
are O
not O
Jews O
will O
share O
with O
the O
Jews O
in O
the O
blessings O
God O
has O
for O
his O
people O
. O

They O
are O
part O
of O
the O
same O
body O
, O
and O
they O
share O
in O
the O
promise O
God O
made O
through O
Christ O
Jesus O
. O

By O
God O
's O
special O
gift O
of O
grace O
, O
I O
became O
a O
servant O
to O
tell O
that O
Good O
News O
. O

He O
gave O
me O
that O
grace O
by O
using O
his O
power O
. O

I O
am O
the O
least O
important O
of O
all O
God O
's O
people O
. O

But O
he O
gave O
me O
this O
gift O
-- O
to O
tell O
the O
non-Jewish O
people O
the O
Good O
News O
about O
the O
riches O
Christ O
has O
. O

These O
riches O
are O
too O
great O
to O
understand O
fully O
. O

And O
God O
gave O
me O
the O
work O
of O
telling O
all O
people O
about O
the O
plan O
for O
his O
secret O
truth O
. O

That O
secret O
truth O
has O
been O
hidden O
in O
him O
since O
the O
beginning O
of O
time O
. O

He O
is O
the O
one O
who O
created O
everything O
. O

His O
purpose O
was O
that O
all O
the O
rulers O
and O
powers O
in O
the O
heavenly O
places O
will O
now O
know O
the O
many O
different O
ways O
he O
shows O
his O
wisdom O
. O

They O
will O
know O
this O
because O
of O
the O
church O
. O

This O
agrees O
with O
the O
plan O
God O
had O
since O
the O
beginning O
of O
time O
. O

He O
did O
what O
he O
planned O
, O
and O
he O
did O
it O
through O
Christ O
Jesus O
our O
Lord O
. O

In O
Christ O
we O
come O
before O
God O
with O
freedom O
and O
without O
fear O
. O

We O
can O
do O
this O
because O
of O
our O
faith O
in O
Christ O
. O

So O
I O
ask O
you O
not O
to O
be O
discouraged O
because O
of O
what O
is O
happening O
to O
me O
. O

My O
sufferings O
are O
for O
your O
benefit O
-- O
for O
your O
honor O
and O
glory O
. O

So O
I O
bow O
in O
prayer O
before O
the O
Father O
. O

Every O
family O
in O
heaven O
and O
on O
earth O
gets O
its O
true O
name O
from O
him O
. O

I O
ask O
the O
Father O
with O
his O
great O
glory O
to O
give O
you O
the O
power O
to O
be O
strong O
in O
your O
spirits O
. O

He O
will O
give O
you O
that O
strength O
through O
his O
Spirit O
. O

I O
pray O
that O
Christ O
will O
live O
in O
your O
hearts O
because O
of O
your O
faith O
. O

I O
pray O
that O
your O
life O
will O
be O
strong O
in O
love O
and O
be O
built O
on O
love O
. O

And O
I O
pray O
that O
you O
and O
all O
God O
's O
holy O
people O
will O
have O
the O
power O
to O
understand O
the O
greatness O
of O
Christ O
's O
love O
-- O
how O
wide O
, O
how O
long O
, O
how O
high O
, O
and O
how O
deep O
that O
love O
is O
. O

Christ O
's O
love O
is O
greater O
than O
anyone O
can O
ever O
know O
, O
but O
I O
pray O
that O
you O
will O
be O
able O
to O
know O
that O
love O
. O

Then O
you O
can O
be O
filled O
with O
everything O
God O
has O
for O
you O
. O

With O
God O
's O
power O
working O
in O
us O
, O
he O
can O
do O
much O
, O
much O
more O
than O
anything O
we O
can O
ask O
or O
think O
of O
. O

To O
him O
be O
glory O
in O
the O
church O
and O
in O
Christ O
Jesus O
for O
all O
time O
, O
forever O
and O
ever O
. O

Amen O
. O

So O
, O
as O
a O
prisoner O
for O
the O
Lord O
, O
I O
beg O
you O
to O
live O
the O
way O
God O
's O
people O
should O
live O
, O
because O
he O
chose O
you O
to O
be O
his O
. O

Always O
be O
humble O
and O
gentle O
. O

Be O
patient O
and O
accept O
each O
other O
with O
love O
. O

You O
are O
joined O
together O
with O
peace O
through O
the O
Spirit O
. O

Do O
all O
you O
can O
to O
continue O
as O
you O
are O
, O
letting O
peace O
hold O
you O
together O
. O

There O
is O
one O
body O
and O
one O
Spirit O
, O
and O
God O
chose O
you O
to O
have O
one O
hope O
. O

There O
is O
one O
Lord O
, O
one O
faith O
, O
and O
one O
baptism O
. O

There O
is O
one O
God O
and O
Father O
of O
us O
all O
, O
who O
rules O
over O
everyone O
. O

He O
works O
through O
all O
of O
us O
and O
in O
all O
of O
us O
. O

Christ O
gave O
each O
one O
of O
us O
a O
special O
gift O
. O

Everyone O
received O
what O
he O
wanted O
to O
give O
them O
. O

That O
is O
why O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
He O
went O
up O
high O
into O
the O
sky O
; O
he O
took O
prisoners O
with O
him O
, O
and O
he O
gave O
gifts O
to O
people O
. O
'' O

When O
it O
says O
, O
`` O
He O
went O
up O
, O
'' O
what O
does O
it O
mean O
? O

It O
means O
that O
he O
first O
came O
down O
low O
to O
earth O
. O

So O
Christ O
came O
down O
, O
and O
he O
is O
the O
same O
one O
who O
went O
up O
. O

He O
went O
up O
above O
the O
highest O
heaven O
in O
order O
to O
fill O
everything O
with O
himself O
. O

And O
that O
same O
Christ O
gave O
these O
gifts O
to O
people O
: O
He O
made O
some O
to O
be O
apostles O
, O
some O
to O
be O
prophets O
, O
some O
to O
go O
and O
tell O
the O
Good O
News O
, O
and O
some O
to O
care O
for O
and O
teach O
God O
's O
people O
. O

Christ O
gave O
these O
gifts O
to O
prepare O
God O
's O
holy O
people O
for O
the O
work O
of O
serving O
, O
to O
make O
the O
body O
of O
Christ O
stronger O
. O

This O
work O
must O
continue O
until O
we O
are O
all O
joined O
together O
in O
what O
we O
believe O
and O
in O
what O
we O
know O
about O
the O
Son O
of O
God O
. O

Our O
goal O
is O
to O
become O
like O
a O
full O
- O
grown O
man O
-- O
to O
look O
just O
like O
Christ O
and O
have O
all O
his O
perfection O
. O

Then O
we O
will O
no O
longer O
be O
like O
babies O
. O

We O
will O
not O
be O
people O
who O
are O
always O
changing O
like O
a O
ship O
that O
the O
waves O
carry O
one O
way O
and O
then O
another O
. O

We O
will O
not O
be O
influenced O
by O
every O
new O
teaching O
we O
hear O
from O
people O
who O
are O
trying O
to O
deceive O
us O
-- O
those O
who O
make O
clever O
plans O
and O
use O
every O
kind O
of O
trick O
to O
fool O
others O
into O
following O
the O
wrong O
way O
. O

No O
, O
we O
will O
speak O
the O
truth O
with O
love O
. O

We O
will O
grow O
to O
be O
like O
Christ O
in O
every O
way O
. O

He O
is O
the O
head O
, O
and O
the O
whole O
body O
depends O
on O
him O
. O

All O
the O
parts O
of O
the O
body O
are O
joined O
and O
held O
together O
, O
with O
each O
part O
doing O
its O
own O
work O
. O

This O
causes O
the O
whole O
body O
to O
grow O
and O
to O
be O
stronger O
in O
love O
. O

I O
have O
something O
from O
the O
Lord O
to O
tell O
you O
. O

I O
warn O
you O
: O
Do O
n't O
continue O
living O
like O
those O
who O
do O
n't O
believe O
. O

Their O
thoughts O
are O
worth O
nothing O
. O

They O
have O
no O
understanding O
, O
and O
they O
know O
nothing O
because O
they O
refuse O
to O
listen O
. O

So O
they O
can O
not O
have O
the O
life O
that O
God O
gives O
. O

They O
have O
lost O
their O
feeling O
of O
shame O
and O
use O
their O
lives O
to O
do O
what O
is O
morally O
wrong O
. O

More O
and O
more O
they O
want O
to O
do O
all O
kinds O
of O
evil O
. O

But O
that O
way O
of O
life O
is O
nothing O
like O
what O
you O
learned O
when O
you O
came O
to O
know O
Christ O
. O

I O
know O
that O
you O
heard O
about O
him O
, O
and O
in O
him O
you O
were O
taught O
the O
truth O
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
truth O
is O
in O
Jesus O
. O

You O
were O
taught O
to O
leave O
your O
old O
self O
. O

This O
means O
that O
you O
must O
stop O
living O
the O
evil O
way O
you O
lived O
before O
. O

That O
old O
self O
gets O
worse O
and O
worse O
, O
because O
people O
are O
fooled O
by O
the O
evil O
they O
want O
to O
do O
. O

You O
must O
be O
made O
new O
in O
your O
hearts O
and O
in O
your O
thinking O
. O

Be O
that O
new O
person O
who O
was O
made O
to O
be O
like O
God O
, O
truly O
good O
and O
pleasing O
to O
him O
. O

So O
you O
must O
stop O
telling O
lies O
. O

`` O
You O
must O
always O
speak O
the O
truth O
to O
each O
other O
, O
'' O
because O
we O
all O
belong O
to O
each O
other O
in O
the O
same O
body O
. O

`` O
When O
you O
are O
angry O
, O
do O
n't O
let O
that O
anger O
make O
you O
sin O
, O
'' O
and O
do O
n't O
stay O
angry O
all O
day O
. O

Do O
n't O
give O
the O
devil O
a O
way O
to O
defeat O
you O
. O

Whoever O
has O
been O
stealing O
must O
stop O
it O
and O
start O
working O
. O

They O
must O
use O
their O
hands O
for O
doing O
something O
good O
. O

Then O
they O
will O
have O
something O
to O
share O
with O
those O
who O
are O
poor O
. O

When O
you O
talk O
, O
do O
n't O
say O
anything O
bad O
. O

But O
say O
the O
good O
things O
that O
people O
need O
-- O
whatever O
will O
help O
them O
grow O
stronger O
. O

Then O
what O
you O
say O
will O
be O
a O
blessing O
to O
those O
who O
hear O
you O
. O

And O
do O
n't O
make O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
sad O
. O

God O
gave O
you O
his O
Spirit O
as O
proof O
that O
you O
belong O
to O
him O
and O
that O
he O
will O
keep O
you O
safe O
until O
the O
day O
he O
makes O
you O
free O
. O

Never O
be O
bitter O
, O
angry O
, O
or O
mad O
. O

Never O
shout O
angrily O
or O
say O
things O
to O
hurt O
others O
. O

Never O
do O
anything O
evil O
. O

Be O
kind O
and O
loving O
to O
each O
other O
. O

Forgive O
each O
other O
the O
same O
as O
God O
forgave O
you O
through O
Christ O
. O

Greetings O
from O
Paul O
, O
an O
apostle O
. O

I O
was O
chosen O
to O
be O
an O
apostle O
, O
but O
not O
by O
any O
group O
or O
person O
here O
on O
earth O
. O

My O
authority O
came O
from O
none O
other O
than O
Jesus O
Christ O
and O
God O
the O
Father O
, O
who O
raised O
Jesus O
from O
death O
. O

Greetings O
also O
from O
all O
those O
in O
God O
's O
family O
who O
are O
with O
me O
. O

To O
the O
churches O
in O
Galatia O
: O
I O
pray O
that O
God O
our O
Father O
and O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
will O
be O
good O
to O
you O
and O
give O
you O
peace O
. O

Jesus O
gave O
himself O
for O
our O
sins O
to O
free O
us O
from O
this O
evil O
world O
we O
live O
in O
. O

This O
is O
what O
God O
our O
Father O
wanted O
. O

The O
glory O
belongs O
to O
God O
forever O
and O
ever O
. O

Amen O
. O

A O
short O
time O
ago O
God O
chose O
you O
to O
follow O
him O
. O

He O
chose O
you O
through O
his O
grace O
that O
came O
through O
Christ O
. O

But O
now O
I O
am O
amazed O
that O
you O
are O
already O
turning O
away O
and O
believing O
something O
different O
from O
the O
Good O
News O
we O
told O
you O
. O

There O
is O
no O
other O
message O
that O
is O
the O
Good O
News O
, O
but O
some O
people O
are O
confusing O
you O
. O

They O
want O
to O
change O
the O
Good O
News O
about O
Christ O
. O

We O
told O
you O
the O
true O
Good O
News O
message O
. O

So O
anyone O
who O
tells O
you O
a O
different O
message O
should O
be O
condemned O
-- O
even O
if O
it O
's O
one O
of O
us O
or O
even O
an O
angel O
from O
heaven O
! O

I O
said O
this O
before O
. O

Now O
I O
say O
it O
again O
: O
You O
have O
already O
accepted O
the O
Good O
News O
. O

Anyone O
who O
tells O
you O
another O
way O
to O
be O
saved O
should O
be O
condemned O
! O

Now O
do O
you O
think O
I O
am O
trying O
to O
make O
people O
accept O
me O
? O

No O
, O
God O
is O
the O
one O
I O
am O
trying O
to O
please O
. O

Am O
I O
trying O
to O
please O
people O
? O

If O
I O
wanted O
to O
please O
people O
, O
I O
would O
not O
be O
a O
servant O
of O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
I O
want O
you O
to O
know O
that O
the O
Good O
News O
message O
I O
told O
you O
was O
not O
made O
up O
by O
anyone O
. O

I O
did O
not O
get O
my O
message O
from O
any O
other O
human O
. O

The O
Good O
News O
is O
not O
something O
I O
learned O
from O
other O
people O
. O

Jesus O
Christ O
himself O
gave O
it O
to O
me O
. O

He O
showed O
me O
the O
Good O
News O
that O
I O
should O
tell O
people O
. O

You O
have O
heard O
about O
my O
past O
life O
in O
the O
Jewish O
religion O
. O

I O
persecuted O
the O
church O
of O
God O
very O
much O
. O

I O
tried O
to O
destroy O
his O
people O
. O

I O
was O
becoming O
a O
leader O
in O
the O
Jewish O
religion O
. O

I O
did O
better O
than O
most O
other O
Jews O
my O
own O
age O
. O

I O
tried O
harder O
than O
anyone O
else O
to O
follow O
the O
traditions O
we O
got O
from O
our O
ancestors O
. O

But O
God O
had O
special O
plans O
for O
me O
even O
before O
I O
was O
born O
. O

So O
he O
chose O
me O
through O
his O
grace O
. O

He O
wanted O
me O
to O
tell O
the O
Good O
News O
about O
his O
Son O
to O
the O
non-Jewish O
people O
. O

So O
God O
let O
me O
see O
and O
learn O
about O
his O
Son O
. O

When O
this O
happened O
, O
I O
did O
not O
get O
advice O
or O
help O
from O
anyone O
. O

I O
did O
not O
go O
to O
Jerusalem O
to O
see O
those O
who O
were O
apostles O
before O
I O
was O
. O

But O
, O
without O
waiting O
, O
I O
went O
away O
to O
Arabia O
. O

Later O
, O
I O
went O
back O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Damascus O
. O

Three O
years O
later O
I O
went O
to O
Jerusalem O
to O
meet O
Peter O
. O

I O
stayed O
with O
him O
15 O
days O
. O

I O
met O
no O
other O
apostles O
-- O
only O
James O
, O
the O
brother O
of O
the O
Lord O
. O

God O
knows O
there O
is O
nothing O
untrue O
in O
any O
of O
this O
. O

Later O
, O
I O
went O
to O
the O
areas O
of O
Syria O
and O
Cilicia O
. O

The O
groups O
of O
believers O
in O
Judea O
who O
belong O
to O
Christ O
had O
never O
met O
me O
before O
. O

They O
had O
only O
heard O
this O
about O
me O
: O
`` O
This O
man O
was O
persecuting O
us O
. O

But O
now O
he O
is O
telling O
people O
about O
the O
same O
faith O
that O
he O
once O
tried O
to O
destroy O
. O
'' O

These O
believers O
praised O
God O
because O
of O
me O
. O

Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
someone O
in O
your O
group O
might O
do O
something O
wrong O
. O

You O
who O
are O
following O
the O
Spirit O
should O
go O
to O
the O
one O
who O
is O
sinning O
. O

Help O
make O
that O
person O
right O
again O
, O
and O
do O
it O
in O
a O
gentle O
way O
. O

But O
be O
careful O
, O
because O
you O
might O
be O
tempted O
to O
sin O
too O
. O

Help O
each O
other O
with O
your O
troubles O
. O

When O
you O
do O
this O
, O
you O
are O
obeying O
the O
law O
of O
Christ O
. O

If O
you O
think O
you O
are O
too O
important O
to O
do O
this O
, O
you O
are O
only O
fooling O
yourself O
. O

Do O
n't O
compare O
yourself O
with O
others O
. O

Just O
look O
at O
your O
own O
work O
to O
see O
if O
you O
have O
done O
anything O
to O
be O
proud O
of O
. O

You O
must O
each O
accept O
the O
responsibilities O
that O
are O
yours O
. O

Whoever O
is O
being O
taught O
God O
's O
word O
should O
share O
the O
good O
things O
they O
have O
with O
the O
one O
who O
is O
teaching O
them O
. O

If O
you O
think O
you O
can O
fool O
God O
, O
you O
are O
only O
fooling O
yourselves O
. O

You O
will O
harvest O
what O
you O
plant O
. O

If O
you O
live O
to O
satisfy O
your O
sinful O
self O
, O
the O
harvest O
you O
will O
get O
from O
that O
will O
be O
eternal O
death O
. O

But O
if O
you O
live O
to O
please O
the O
Spirit O
, O
your O
harvest O
from O
the O
Spirit O
will O
be O
eternal O
life O
. O

We O
must O
not O
get O
tired O
of O
doing O
good O
. O

We O
will O
receive O
our O
harvest O
of O
eternal O
life O
at O
the O
right O
time O
. O

We O
must O
not O
give O
up O
. O

When O
we O
have O
the O
opportunity O
to O
do O
good O
to O
anyone O
, O
we O
should O
do O
it O
. O

But O
we O
should O
give O
special O
attention O
to O
those O
who O
are O
in O
the O
family O
of O
believers O
. O

This O
is O
my O
own O
handwriting O
. O

You O
can O
see O
how O
big O
the O
letters O
are O
. O

Those O
men O
who O
are O
trying O
to O
force O
you O
to O
be O
circumcised O
are O
only O
doing O
it O
so O
that O
their O
people O
will O
accept O
them O
. O

They O
are O
afraid O
they O
will O
be O
persecuted O
if O
they O
follow O
only O
the O
cross O
of O
Christ O
. O

They O
are O
circumcised O
, O
but O
they O
do O
n't O
obey O
the O
law O
themselves O
. O

They O
want O
you O
to O
be O
circumcised O
so O
that O
they O
can O
boast O
about O
what O
they O
did O
to O
you O
. O

I O
hope O
I O
will O
never O
boast O
about O
things O
like O
that O
. O

The O
cross O
of O
our O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
is O
my O
only O
reason O
for O
boasting O
. O

Through O
Jesus O
' O
death O
on O
the O
cross O
the O
world O
is O
dead O
to O
me O
, O
and O
I O
am O
dead O
to O
the O
world O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
matter O
if O
anyone O
is O
circumcised O
or O
not O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
matters O
is O
this O
new O
life O
we O
have O
from O
God O
. O

Peace O
and O
mercy O
to O
those O
who O
follow O
this O
rule O
-- O
to O
all O
God O
's O
people O
. O

So O
do O
n't O
give O
me O
any O
more O
trouble O
. O

I O
have O
scars O
on O
my O
body O
that O
show O
I O
belong O
to O
Jesus O
. O

My O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
I O
pray O
that O
the O
grace O
of O
our O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
will O
be O
with O
your O
spirits O
. O

Amen O
. O

After O
14 O
years O
I O
went O
back O
to O
Jerusalem O
with O
Barnabas O
and O
took O
Titus O
with O
me O
. O

I O
went O
there O
because O
God O
showed O
me O
that O
I O
should O
go O
. O

I O
explained O
to O
them O
the O
message O
that O
I O
tell O
the O
non-Jewish O
people O
. O

I O
also O
met O
alone O
with O
those O
who O
were O
considered O
to O
be O
the O
leaders O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
be O
sure O
we O
were O
in O
agreement O
so O
that O
my O
past O
work O
and O
the O
work O
I O
do O
now O
would O
not O
be O
wasted O
. O

Titus O
, O
who O
was O
with O
me O
, O
is O
a O
Greek O
. O

But O
these O
leaders O
still O
did O
not O
force O
him O
to O
be O
circumcised O
. O

We O
needed O
to O
talk O
about O
these O
problems O
, O
because O
some O
who O
pretended O
to O
be O
our O
brothers O
had O
come O
into O
our O
group O
secretly O
. O

They O
came O
in O
like O
spies O
to O
find O
out O
about O
the O
freedom O
we O
have O
in O
Christ O
Jesus O
. O

They O
wanted O
to O
make O
us O
slaves O
, O
but O
we O
did O
not O
agree O
with O
anything O
those O
false O
brothers O
wanted O
. O

We O
wanted O
the O
truth O
of O
the O
Good O
News O
to O
continue O
for O
you O
. O

Those O
men O
who O
were O
considered O
to O
be O
important O
did O
not O
change O
the O
Good O
News O
message O
I O
tell O
people O
. O

-LRB- O
It O
does O
n't O
matter O
to O
me O
if O
they O
were O
`` O
important O
'' O
or O
not O
. O

To O
God O
everyone O
is O
the O
same O
. O
-RRB- O

But O
these O
leaders O
saw O
that O
God O
had O
given O
me O
a O
special O
work O
, O
the O
same O
as O
Peter O
. O

God O
gave O
Peter O
the O
work O
of O
telling O
the O
Good O
News O
to O
the O
Jews O
. O

But O
God O
gave O
me O
the O
work O
of O
telling O
the O
Good O
News O
to O
the O
non-Jewish O
people O
. O

God O
gave O
Peter O
the O
power O
to O
work O
as O
an O
apostle O
for O
the O
Jewish O
people O
. O

God O
gave O
me O
the O
power O
to O
work O
as O
an O
apostle O
too O
, O
but O
for O
those O
who O
are O
not O
Jews O
. O

James O
, O
Peter O
, O
and O
John O
seemed O
to O
be O
the O
leaders O
. O

And O
they O
saw O
that O
God O
had O
given O
me O
this O
special O
gift O
of O
ministry O
, O
so O
they O
accepted O
Barnabas O
and O
me O
. O

They O
said O
to O
us O
, O
`` O
We O
agree O
that O
you O
should O
go O
to O
those O
who O
are O
not O
Jews O
, O
and O
we O
will O
go O
to O
the O
Jews O
. O
'' O

They O
asked O
us O
to O
do O
only O
one O
thing O
-- O
to O
remember O
to O
help O
those O
who O
are O
poor O
. O

And O
this O
was O
something O
that O
I O
really O
wanted O
to O
do O
. O

When O
Peter O
came O
to O
Antioch O
, O
he O
did O
something O
that O
was O
not O
right O
. O

I O
stood O
against O
him O
, O
because O
he O
was O
wrong O
. O

This O
is O
what O
happened O
: O
When O
Peter O
first O
came O
to O
Antioch O
, O
he O
ate O
and O
associated O
with O
the O
non-Jewish O
people O
. O

But O
when O
some O
Jewish O
men O
came O
from O
James O
, O
Peter O
separated O
himself O
from O
the O
non-Jews O
. O

He O
stopped O
eating O
with O
them O
, O
because O
he O
was O
afraid O
of O
the O
Jews O
who O
believe O
that O
all O
non-Jewish O
people O
must O
be O
circumcised O
. O

So O
Peter O
was O
a O
hypocrite O
. O

The O
other O
Jewish O
believers O
joined O
with O
him O
, O
so O
they O
were O
hypocrites O
too O
. O

Even O
Barnabas O
was O
influenced O
by O
what O
these O
Jewish O
believers O
did O
. O

They O
were O
not O
following O
the O
truth O
of O
the O
Good O
News O
. O

When O
I O
saw O
this O
, O
I O
spoke O
to O
Peter O
in O
front O
of O
everyone O
. O

I O
said O
, O
`` O
Peter O
, O
you O
are O
a O
Jew O
, O
but O
you O
do O
n't O
live O
like O
one O
. O

You O
live O
like O
someone O
who O
is O
not O
a O
Jew O
. O

So O
why O
are O
you O
trying O
to O
force O
those O
who O
are O
not O
Jewish O
to O
live O
like O
Jews O
? O
'' O

We O
are O
Jews O
by O
birth O
. O

We O
were O
not O
born O
`` O
sinners O
, O
'' O
as O
we O
call O
those O
who O
are O
not O
Jews O
. O

But O
we O
know O
that O
no O
one O
is O
made O
right O
with O
God O
by O
following O
the O
law O
. O

It O
is O
trusting O
in O
Jesus O
Christ O
that O
makes O
a O
person O
right O
with O
God O
. O

So O
we O
have O
put O
our O
faith O
in O
Christ O
Jesus O
, O
because O
we O
wanted O
to O
be O
made O
right O
with O
God O
. O

And O
we O
are O
right O
with O
him O
because O
we O
trusted O
in O
Christ O
-- O
not O
because O
we O
followed O
the O
law O
. O

I O
can O
say O
this O
because O
no O
one O
can O
be O
made O
right O
with O
God O
by O
following O
the O
law O
. O

We O
Jews O
came O
to O
Christ O
to O
be O
made O
right O
with O
God O
, O
so O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
we O
were O
sinners O
too O
. O

Does O
this O
mean O
that O
Christ O
makes O
us O
sinners O
? O

Of O
course O
not O
. O

But O
I O
would O
be O
wrong O
to O
begin O
teaching O
again O
those O
things O
that O
I O
gave O
up O
. O

It O
was O
the O
law O
itself O
that O
caused O
me O
to O
end O
my O
life O
under O
the O
law O
. O

I O
died O
to O
the O
law O
so O
that O
I O
could O
live O
for O
God O
. O

I O
have O
been O
nailed O
to O
the O
cross O
with O
Christ O
. O

So O
I O
am O
not O
the O
one O
living O
now O
-- O
it O
is O
Christ O
living O
in O
me O
. O

I O
still O
live O
in O
my O
body O
, O
but O
I O
live O
by O
faith O
in O
the O
Son O
of O
God O
. O

He O
is O
the O
one O
who O
loved O
me O
and O
gave O
himself O
to O
save O
me O
. O

I O
am O
not O
the O
one O
destroying O
the O
meaning O
of O
God O
's O
grace O
. O

If O
following O
the O
law O
is O
how O
people O
are O
made O
right O
with O
God O
, O
then O
Christ O
did O
not O
have O
to O
die O
. O

We O
have O
freedom O
now O
, O
because O
Christ O
made O
us O
free O
. O

So O
stand O
strong O
in O
that O
freedom O
. O

Do O
n't O
go O
back O
into O
slavery O
again O
. O

Listen O
! O

I O
, O
Paul O
, O
tell O
you O
that O
if O
you O
start O
following O
the O
law O
by O
being O
circumcised O
, O
then O
Christ O
can O
not O
help O
you O
. O

Again O
, O
I O
warn O
everyone O
: O
If O
you O
allow O
yourselves O
to O
be O
circumcised O
, O
then O
you O
must O
follow O
the O
whole O
law O
. O

If O
you O
try O
to O
be O
made O
right O
with O
God O
through O
the O
law O
, O
your O
life O
with O
Christ O
is O
finished O
-- O
you O
have O
left O
God O
's O
grace O
. O

I O
say O
this O
because O
our O
hope O
of O
being O
right O
with O
God O
comes O
through O
faith O
. O

And O
the O
Spirit O
helps O
us O
feel O
sure O
as O
we O
wait O
for O
that O
hope O
. O

When O
someone O
belongs O
to O
Christ O
Jesus O
, O
it O
is O
not O
important O
if O
they O
are O
circumcised O
or O
not O
. O

The O
important O
thing O
is O
faith O
-- O
the O
kind O
of O
faith O
that O
works O
through O
love O
. O

You O
were O
doing O
so O
well O
. O

Who O
caused O
you O
to O
stop O
following O
the O
truth O
? O

It O
certainly O
was O
n't O
the O
one O
who O
chose O
you O
. O

Be O
careful O
! O

`` O
Just O
a O
little O
yeast O
makes O
the O
whole O
batch O
of O
dough O
rise O
. O
'' O

I O
trust O
in O
the O
Lord O
that O
you O
will O
not O
believe O
those O
different O
ideas O
. O

Someone O
is O
trying O
to O
confuse O
you O
. O

Whoever O
it O
is O
will O
be O
punished O
. O

My O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
teach O
that O
a O
man O
must O
be O
circumcised O
. O

If O
I O
do O
teach O
circumcision O
, O
then O
why O
am O
I O
still O
being O
persecuted O
? O

If O
I O
still O
taught O
circumcision O
, O
then O
my O
message O
about O
the O
cross O
would O
not O
be O
a O
problem O
. O

I O
wish O
those O
people O
who O
are O
bothering O
you O
would O
add O
castration O
to O
their O
circumcision O
. O

My O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
God O
chose O
you O
to O
be O
free O
. O

But O
do O
n't O
use O
your O
freedom O
as O
an O
excuse O
to O
do O
what O
pleases O
your O
sinful O
selves O
. O

Instead O
, O
serve O
each O
other O
with O
love O
. O

The O
whole O
law O
is O
made O
complete O
in O
this O
one O
command O
: O
`` O
Love O
your O
neighbor O
the O
same O
as O
you O
love O
yourself O
. O
'' O

If O
you O
continue O
hurting O
each O
other O
and O
tearing O
each O
other O
apart O
, O
be O
careful O
, O
or O
you O
will O
completely O
destroy O
each O
other O
. O

So O
I O
tell O
you O
, O
live O
the O
way O
the O
Spirit O
leads O
you O
. O

Then O
you O
will O
not O
do O
the O
evil O
things O
your O
sinful O
self O
wants O
. O

The O
sinful O
self O
wants O
what O
is O
against O
the O
Spirit O
, O
and O
the O
Spirit O
wants O
what O
is O
against O
the O
sinful O
self O
. O

They O
are O
always O
fighting O
against O
each O
other O
, O
so O
that O
you O
do O
n't O
do O
what O
you O
really O
want O
to O
do O
. O

But O
if O
you O
let O
the O
Spirit O
lead O
you O
, O
you O
are O
not O
under O
law O
. O

The O
wrong O
things O
the O
sinful O
self O
does O
are O
clear O
: O

committing O
sexual O
sin O
, O
being O
morally O
bad O
, O
doing O
all O
kinds O
of O
shameful O
things O
, O
worshiping O
false O
gods O
, O
taking O
part O
in O
witchcraft O
, O
hating O
people O
, O
causing O
trouble O
, O
being O
jealous O
, O
angry O
or O
selfish O
, O
causing O
people O
to O
argue O
and O
divide O
into O
separate O
groups O
, O
being O
filled O
with O
envy O
, O
getting O
drunk O
, O
having O
wild O
parties O
, O
and O
doing O
other O
things O
like O
this O
. O

I O
warn O
you O
now O
as O
I O
warned O
you O
before O
: O
The O
people O
who O
do O
these O
things O
will O
not O
have O
a O
part O
in O
God O
's O
kingdom O
. O

But O
the O
fruit O
that O
the O
Spirit O
produces O
in O
a O
person O
's O
life O
is O
love O
, O
joy O
, O
peace O
, O
patience O
, O
kindness O
, O
goodness O
, O
faithfulness O
, O
gentleness O
, O
and O
self O
- O
control O
. O

There O
is O
no O
law O
against O
these O
kinds O
of O
things O
. O

Those O
who O
belong O
to O
Christ O
Jesus O
have O
crucified O
their O
sinful O
self O
. O

They O
have O
given O
up O
their O
old O
selfish O
feelings O
and O
the O
evil O
things O
they O
wanted O
to O
do O
. O

We O
get O
our O
new O
life O
from O
the O
Spirit O
, O
so O
we O
should O
follow O
the O
Spirit O
. O

We O
must O
not O
feel O
proud O
and O
boast O
about O
ourselves O
. O

We O
must O
not O
cause O
trouble O
for O
each O
other O
or O
be O
jealous O
of O
each O
other O
. O

You O
people O
in O
Galatia O
are O
so O
foolish O
! O

Why O
do O
I O
say O
this O
? O

Because O
I O
told O
you O
very O
clearly O
about O
the O
death O
of O
Jesus O
Christ O
on O
the O
cross O
. O

But O
now O
it O
seems O
as O
though O
you O
have O
let O
someone O
use O
their O
magical O
powers O
to O
make O
you O
forget O
. O

Tell O
me O
this O
one O
thing O
: O
How O
did O
you O
receive O
the O
Spirit O
? O

Did O
you O
receive O
the O
Spirit O
by O
following O
the O
law O
? O

No O
, O
you O
received O
the O
Spirit O
because O
you O
heard O
the O
message O
about O
Jesus O
and O
believed O
it O
. O

You O
began O
your O
life O
in O
Christ O
with O
the O
Spirit O
. O

Now O
do O
you O
try O
to O
complete O
it O
by O
your O
own O
power O
? O

That O
is O
foolish O
. O

You O
have O
experienced O
many O
things O
. O

Were O
all O
those O
experiences O
wasted O
? O

I O
hope O
they O
were O
not O
wasted O
! O

Does O
God O
give O
you O
the O
Spirit O
because O
you O
follow O
the O
law O
? O

Does O
God O
work O
miracles O
among O
you O
because O
you O
follow O
the O
law O
? O

No O
, O
God O
gives O
you O
his O
Spirit O
and O
works O
miracles O
among O
you O
because O
you O
heard O
the O
message O
about O
Jesus O
and O
believed O
it O
. O

The O
Scriptures O
say O
the O
same O
thing O
about O
Abraham O
. O

`` O
Abraham O
believed O
God O
, O
and O
because O
of O
this O
faith O
he O
was O
accepted O
as O
one O
who O
is O
right O
with O
God O
. O
'' O

So O
you O
should O
know O
that O
the O
true O
children O
of O
Abraham O
are O
those O
who O
have O
faith O
. O

The O
Scriptures O
told O
what O
would O
happen O
in O
the O
future O
. O

These O
writings O
said O
that O
God O
would O
make O
the O
non-Jewish O
people O
right O
through O
their O
faith O
. O

God O
told O
this O
Good O
News O
to O
Abraham O
before O
it O
happened O
. O

God O
said O
to O
Abraham O
, O
`` O
I O
will O
use O
you O
to O
bless O
all O
the O
people O
on O
earth O
. O
'' O

Abraham O
believed O
this O
, O
and O
because O
he O
believed O
, O
he O
was O
blessed O
. O

All O
people O
who O
believe O
are O
blessed O
the O
same O
as O
Abraham O
was O
. O

But O
people O
who O
depend O
on O
following O
the O
law O
to O
make O
them O
right O
are O
under O
a O
curse O
. O

As O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
They O
must O
do O
everything O
that O
is O
written O
in O
the O
law O
. O

If O
they O
do O
not O
always O
obey O
, O
they O
are O
under O
a O
curse O
. O
'' O

So O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
no O
one O
can O
be O
made O
right O
with O
God O
by O
the O
law O
. O

The O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
The O
one O
who O
is O
right O
with O
God O
by O
faith O
will O
live O
forever O
. O
'' O

The O
law O
does O
not O
depend O
on O
faith O
. O

No O
, O
it O
says O
that O
the O
only O
way O
a O
person O
will O
find O
life O
by O
the O
law O
is O
to O
obey O
its O
commands O
. O

The O
law O
says O
we O
are O
under O
a O
curse O
for O
not O
always O
obeying O
it O
. O

But O
Christ O
took O
away O
that O
curse O
. O

He O
changed O
places O
with O
us O
and O
put O
himself O
under O
that O
curse O
. O

The O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
Anyone O
who O
is O
hung O
on O
a O
tree O
is O
under O
a O
curse O
. O
'' O

Because O
of O
what O
Jesus O
Christ O
did O
, O
the O
blessing O
God O
promised O
to O
Abraham O
was O
given O
to O
all O
people O
. O

Christ O
died O
so O
that O
by O
believing O
in O
him O
we O
could O
have O
the O
Spirit O
that O
God O
promised O
. O

Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
let O
me O
give O
you O
an O
example O
from O
everyday O
life O
: O
Think O
about O
an O
agreement O
that O
one O
person O
makes O
with O
another O
. O

After O
that O
agreement O
is O
made O
official O
, O
no O
one O
can O
stop O
it O
or O
add O
anything O
to O
it O
, O
and O
no O
one O
can O
ignore O
it O
. O

God O
made O
promises O
to O
Abraham O
and O
his O
Descendant O
. O

The O
Scripture O
does O
not O
say O
, O
`` O
and O
to O
your O
descendants O
. O
'' O

That O
would O
mean O
many O
people O
. O

But O
it O
says O
, O
`` O
and O
to O
your O
Descendant O
. O
'' O

That O
means O
only O
one O
, O
and O
that O
one O
is O
Christ O
. O

This O
is O
what O
I O
mean O
: O
The O
agreement O
that O
God O
gave O
to O
Abraham O
was O
made O
official O
long O
before O
the O
law O
came O
. O

The O
law O
came O
430 O
years O
later O
. O

So O
the O
law O
could O
not O
take O
away O
the O
agreement O
and O
change O
God O
's O
promise O
. O

Can O
following O
the O
law O
give O
us O
the O
blessing O
God O
promised O
? O

If O
we O
could O
receive O
it O
by O
following O
the O
law O
, O
then O
it O
would O
not O
be O
God O
's O
promise O
that O
brings O
it O
to O
us O
. O

But O
God O
freely O
gave O
his O
blessings O
to O
Abraham O
through O
the O
promise O
God O
made O
. O

So O
what O
was O
the O
law O
for O
? O

The O
law O
was O
given O
to O
show O
the O
wrong O
things O
people O
do O
. O

The O
law O
would O
continue O
until O
the O
special O
Descendant O
of O
Abraham O
came O
. O

This O
is O
the O
Descendant O
mentioned O
in O
the O
promise O
, O
which O
came O
directly O
from O
God O
. O

But O
the O
law O
was O
given O
through O
angels O
, O
and O
the O
angels O
used O
Moses O
as O
a O
mediator O
to O
give O
the O
law O
to O
the O
people O
. O

But O
when O
God O
gave O
the O
promise O
, O
there O
was O
no O
mediator O
, O
because O
a O
mediator O
is O
not O
needed O
when O
there O
is O
only O
one O
side O
, O
and O
God O
is O
one O
. O

Does O
this O
mean O
that O
the O
law O
works O
against O
God O
's O
promises O
? O

Of O
course O
not O
. O

The O
law O
was O
never O
God O
's O
way O
of O
giving O
new O
life O
to O
people O
. O

If O
it O
were O
, O
then O
we O
could O
be O
made O
right O
with O
God O
by O
following O
the O
law O
. O

But O
this O
is O
not O
possible O
. O

The O
Scriptures O
put O
the O
whole O
world O
in O
prison O
under O
the O
control O
of O
sin O
, O
so O
that O
the O
only O
way O
for O
people O
to O
get O
what O
God O
promised O
would O
be O
through O
faith O
in O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

It O
is O
given O
to O
those O
who O
believe O
in O
him O
. O

Before O
this O
faith O
came O
, O
the O
law O
held O
us O
as O
prisoners O
. O

We O
had O
no O
freedom O
until O
God O
showed O
us O
the O
way O
of O
faith O
that O
was O
coming O
. O

I O
mean O
the O
law O
was O
the O
guardian O
in O
charge O
of O
us O
until O
Christ O
came O
. O

After O
he O
came O
, O
we O
could O
be O
made O
right O
with O
God O
through O
faith O
. O

Now O
that O
the O
way O
of O
faith O
has O
come O
, O
we O
no O
longer O
need O
the O
law O
to O
be O
our O
guardian O
. O

You O
were O
all O
baptized O
into O
Christ O
, O
and O
so O
you O
were O
all O
clothed O
with O
Christ O
. O

This O
shows O
that O
you O
are O
all O
children O
of O
God O
through O
faith O
in O
Christ O
Jesus O
. O

Now O
, O
in O
Christ O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
matter O
if O
you O
are O
a O
Jew O
or O
a O
Greek O
, O
a O
slave O
or O
free O
, O
male O
or O
female O
. O

You O
are O
all O
the O
same O
in O
Christ O
Jesus O
. O

You O
belong O
to O
Christ O
, O
so O
you O
are O
Abraham O
's O
descendants O
. O

You O
get O
all O
of O
God O
's O
blessings O
because O
of O
the O
promise O
that O
God O
made O
to O
Abraham O
. O

This O
is O
what O
I O
am O
saying O
: O
When O
young O
children O
inherit O
all O
that O
their O
father O
owned O
, O
they O
are O
still O
no O
different O
from O
his O
slaves O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
matter O
that O
they O
own O
everything O
. O

While O
they O
are O
children O
, O
they O
must O
obey O
those O
who O
are O
chosen O
to O
care O
for O
them O
. O

But O
when O
they O
reach O
the O
age O
the O
father O
set O
, O
they O
are O
free O
. O

It O
is O
the O
same O
for O
us O
. O

We O
were O
once O
like O
children O
, O
slaves O
to O
the O
useless O
rules O
of O
this O
world O
. O

But O
when O
the O
right O
time O
came O
, O
God O
sent O
his O
Son O
, O
who O
was O
born O
from O
a O
woman O
and O
lived O
under O
the O
law O
. O

God O
did O
this O
so O
that O
he O
could O
buy O
the O
freedom O
of O
those O
who O
were O
under O
the O
law O
. O

God O
's O
purpose O
was O
to O
make O
us O
his O
children O
. O

Since O
you O
are O
now O
God O
's O
children O
, O
he O
has O
sent O
the O
Spirit O
of O
his O
Son O
into O
your O
hearts O
. O

The O
Spirit O
cries O
out O
, O
`` O
Abba O
, O
Father O
. O
'' O

Now O
you O
are O
not O
slaves O
like O
before O
. O

You O
are O
God O
's O
children O
, O
and O
you O
will O
receive O
everything O
he O
promised O
his O
children O
. O

In O
the O
past O
you O
did O
not O
know O
God O
. O

You O
were O
slaves O
to O
gods O
that O
were O
not O
real O
. O

But O
now O
you O
know O
the O
true O
God O
. O

Really O
, O
though O
, O
it O
is O
God O
who O
knows O
you O
. O

So O
why O
do O
you O
turn O
back O
to O
the O
same O
kind O
of O
weak O
and O
useless O
rules O
you O
followed O
before O
? O

Do O
you O
want O
to O
be O
slaves O
to O
those O
things O
again O
? O

It O
worries O
me O
that O
you O
follow O
teachings O
about O
special O
days O
, O
months O
, O
seasons O
, O
and O
years O
. O

I O
fear O
that O
my O
work O
for O
you O
has O
been O
wasted O
. O

Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
I O
became O
like O
you O
. O

So O
please O
become O
like O
me O
. O

You O
were O
very O
good O
to O
me O
before O
. O

You O
know O
that O
I O
came O
to O
you O
the O
first O
time O
because O
I O
was O
sick O
. O

That O
was O
when O
I O
told O
the O
Good O
News O
to O
you O
. O

My O
sickness O
was O
a O
burden O
to O
you O
, O
but O
you O
did O
not O
stop O
showing O
me O
respect O
or O
make O
me O
leave O
. O

Instead O
, O
you O
welcomed O
me O
as O
if O
I O
were O
an O
angel O
from O
God O
. O

You O
accepted O
me O
as O
if O
I O
were O
Jesus O
Christ O
himself O
! O

You O
were O
very O
happy O
then O
. O

Where O
is O
that O
joy O
now O
? O

I O
can O
say O
without O
a O
doubt O
that O
you O
would O
have O
done O
anything O
to O
help O
me O
. O

If O
it O
had O
been O
possible O
, O
you O
would O
have O
taken O
out O
your O
own O
eyes O
and O
given O
them O
to O
me O
. O

Am O
I O
now O
your O
enemy O
because O
I O
tell O
you O
the O
truth O
? O

Those O
people O
are O
working O
hard O
to O
persuade O
you O
, O
but O
this O
is O
not O
good O
for O
you O
. O

They O
want O
to O
persuade O
you O
to O
turn O
against O
us O
and O
work O
hard O
for O
them O
. O

It O
is O
good O
for O
you O
to O
work O
hard O
, O
Of O
course O
, O
if O
it O
is O
for O
something O
good O
. O

That O
's O
something O
you O
should O
do O
whether O
I O
am O
there O
or O
not O
. O

My O
little O
children O
, O
I O
am O
in O
pain O
again O
over O
you O
, O
like O
a O
mother O
giving O
birth O
. O

I O
will O
feel O
this O
pain O
until O
people O
can O
look O
at O
you O
and O
see O
Christ O
. O

I O
wish O
I O
could O
be O
with O
you O
now O
. O

Then O
maybe O
I O
could O
change O
the O
way O
I O
am O
talking O
to O
you O
. O

Now O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
to O
do O
about O
you O
. O

Some O
of O
you O
people O
want O
to O
be O
under O
the O
law O
. O

Tell O
me O
, O
do O
you O
know O
what O
the O
law O
says O
? O

The O
Scriptures O
say O
that O
Abraham O
had O
two O
sons O
. O

The O
mother O
of O
one O
son O
was O
a O
slave O
woman O
, O
and O
the O
mother O
of O
the O
other O
son O
was O
a O
free O
woman O
. O

Abraham O
's O
son O
from O
the O
slave O
woman O
was O
born O
in O
the O
normal O
human O
way O
. O

But O
the O
son O
from O
the O
free O
woman O
was O
born O
because O
of O
the O
promise O
God O
made O
to O
Abraham O
. O

This O
true O
story O
makes O
a O
picture O
for O
us O
. O

The O
two O
women O
are O
like O
the O
two O
agreements O
between O
God O
and O
his O
people O
. O

One O
agreement O
is O
the O
law O
that O
God O
made O
on O
Mount O
Sinai O
. O

The O
people O
who O
are O
under O
this O
agreement O
are O
like O
slaves O
. O

The O
mother O
named O
Hagar O
is O
like O
that O
agreement O
. O

So O
Hagar O
is O
like O
Mount O
Sinai O
in O
Arabia O
. O

She O
is O
a O
picture O
of O
the O
earthly O
Jewish O
city O
of O
Jerusalem O
. O

This O
city O
is O
a O
slave O
, O
and O
all O
its O
people O
are O
slaves O
to O
the O
law O
. O

But O
the O
heavenly O
Jerusalem O
that O
is O
above O
is O
like O
the O
free O
woman O
, O
who O
is O
our O
mother O
. O

The O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
Be O
happy O
, O
woman O
-- O
you O
who O
can O
not O
have O
children O
. O

Be O
glad O
you O
never O
gave O
birth O
. O

Shout O
and O
cry O
with O
joy O
! O

You O
never O
felt O
those O
labor O
pains O
. O

The O
woman O
who O
is O
alone O
will O
have O
more O
children O
than O
the O
woman O
who O
has O
a O
husband O
. O
'' O

My O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
you O
are O
children O
who O
were O
born O
because O
of O
God O
's O
promise O
, O
just O
as O
Isaac O
was O
. O

But O
the O
other O
son O
of O
Abraham O
, O
who O
was O
born O
in O
the O
normal O
way O
, O
caused O
trouble O
for O
the O
one O
who O
was O
born O
by O
the O
power O
of O
the O
Spirit O
. O

It O
is O
the O
same O
today O
. O

But O
what O
do O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
? O

`` O
Throw O
out O
the O
slave O
woman O
and O
her O
son O
! O

The O
son O
of O
the O
free O
woman O
will O
receive O
everything O
his O
father O
has O
, O
but O
the O
son O
of O
the O
slave O
woman O
will O
receive O
nothing O
. O
'' O

So O
, O
my O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
we O
are O
not O
children O
of O
the O
slave O
woman O
. O

We O
are O
children O
of O
the O
free O
woman O
. O

Jesus O
left O
and O
went O
back O
to O
his O
hometown O
. O

His O
followers O
went O
with O
him O
. O

On O
the O
Sabbath O
day O
Jesus O
taught O
in O
the O
synagogue O
, O
and O
many O
people O
heard O
him O
. O

They O
were O
amazed O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Where O
did O
this O
man O
get O
this O
teaching O
? O

How O
did O
he O
get O
such O
wisdom O
? O

Who O
gave O
it O
to O
him O
? O

And O
where O
did O
he O
get O
the O
power O
to O
do O
miracles O
? O

Is O
n't O
he O
just O
the O
carpenter O
we O
know O
-- O
Mary O
's O
son O
, O
the O
brother O
of O
James O
, O
Joses O
, O
Judas O
, O
and O
Simon O
? O

And O
do O
n't O
his O
sisters O
still O
live O
here O
in O
town O
? O
'' O

So O
they O
had O
a O
problem O
accepting O
him O
. O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
People O
everywhere O
give O
honor O
to O
a O
prophet O
, O
except O
in O
his O
own O
town O
, O
with O
his O
own O
people O
, O
or O
in O
his O
home O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
was O
not O
able O
to O
do O
any O
miracles O
there O
except O
the O
healing O
of O
some O
sick O
people O
by O
laying O
his O
hands O
on O
them O
. O

He O
was O
surprised O
that O
the O
people O
there O
had O
no O
faith O
. O

Then O
he O
went O
to O
other O
villages O
in O
that O
area O
and O
taught O
. O

Jesus O
called O
his O
twelve O
apostles O
together O
. O

He O
sent O
them O
out O
in O
groups O
of O
two O
and O
gave O
them O
power O
over O
evil O
spirits O
. O

This O
is O
what O
he O
told O
them O
: O
`` O
Take O
nothing O
for O
your O
trip O
except O
a O
stick O
for O
walking O
. O

Take O
no O
bread O
, O
no O
bag O
, O
and O
no O
money O
. O

You O
can O
wear O
sandals O
, O
but O
do O
n't O
take O
extra O
clothes O
. O

When O
you O
enter O
a O
house O
, O
stay O
there O
until O
you O
leave O
that O
town O
. O

If O
any O
town O
refuses O
to O
accept O
you O
or O
refuses O
to O
listen O
to O
you O
, O
then O
leave O
that O
town O
and O
shake O
the O
dust O
off O
your O
feet O
as O
a O
warning O
to O
them O
. O
'' O

The O
apostles O
left O
and O
went O
to O
other O
places O
. O

They O
talked O
to O
the O
people O
and O
told O
them O
to O
change O
their O
hearts O
and O
lives O
. O

They O
forced O
many O
demons O
out O
of O
people O
and O
put O
olive O
oil O
on O
many O
who O
were O
sick O
and O
healed O
them O
. O

King O
Herod O
heard O
about O
Jesus O
, O
because O
Jesus O
was O
now O
famous O
. O

Some O
people O
said O
, O
`` O
He O
is O
John O
the O
Baptizer O
. O

He O
must O
have O
risen O
from O
death O
, O
and O
that O
is O
why O
he O
can O
do O
these O
miracles O
. O
'' O

Other O
people O
said O
, O
`` O
He O
is O
Elijah O
. O
'' O

And O
others O
said O
, O
`` O
He O
is O
a O
prophet O
. O

He O
is O
like O
the O
prophets O
who O
lived O
long O
ago O
. O
'' O

Herod O
heard O
these O
things O
about O
Jesus O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
killed O
John O
by O
cutting O
off O
his O
head O
. O

Now O
he O
has O
been O
raised O
from O
death O
! O
'' O

Herod O
himself O
had O
ordered O
his O
soldiers O
to O
arrest O
John O
and O
put O
him O
in O
prison O
. O

Herod O
did O
this O
to O
please O
his O
wife O
Herodias O
. O

She O
had O
been O
married O
to O
Herod O
's O
brother O
Philip O
, O
but O
then O
Herod O
married O
her O
. O

John O
told O
Herod O
, O
`` O
It O
is O
not O
right O
for O
you O
to O
be O
married O
to O
your O
brother O
's O
wife O
. O
'' O

So O
Herodias O
hated O
John O
. O

She O
wanted O
him O
dead O
, O
but O
she O
was O
not O
able O
to O
persuade O
Herod O
to O
kill O
him O
. O

Herod O
was O
afraid O
to O
kill O
John O
, O
because O
he O
knew O
that O
he O
was O
a O
good O
and O
holy O
man O
. O

So O
he O
protected O
him O
. O

He O
liked O
listening O
to O
John O
, O
although O
what O
John O
said O
left O
him O
with O
so O
many O
questions O
. O

Then O
the O
right O
time O
came O
for O
Herodias O
to O
cause O
John O
's O
death O
. O

It O
happened O
on O
Herod O
's O
birthday O
. O

Herod O
gave O
a O
dinner O
party O
for O
the O
most O
important O
government O
leaders O
, O
the O
commanders O
of O
his O
army O
, O
and O
the O
most O
important O
people O
in O
Galilee O
. O

The O
daughter O
of O
Herodias O
came O
to O
the O
party O
and O
danced O
. O

When O
she O
danced O
, O
Herod O
and O
the O
people O
eating O
with O
him O
were O
very O
pleased O
. O

So O
King O
Herod O
said O
to O
the O
girl O
, O
`` O
I O
will O
give O
you O
anything O
you O
want O
. O
'' O

He O
promised O
her O
, O
`` O
Anything O
you O
ask O
for O
I O
will O
give O
to O
you O
-- O
even O
half O
of O
my O
kingdom O
. O
'' O

The O
girl O
went O
to O
her O
mother O
and O
asked O
, O
`` O
What O
should O
I O
ask O
King O
Herod O
to O
give O
me O
? O
'' O

Her O
mother O
answered O
, O
`` O
Ask O
for O
the O
head O
of O
John O
the O
Baptizer O
. O
'' O

So O
right O
then O
the O
girl O
went O
back O
in O
to O
the O
king O
. O

She O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Please O
give O
me O
the O
head O
of O
John O
the O
Baptizer O
. O

Bring O
it O
to O
me O
now O
on O
a O
plate O
. O
'' O

King O
Herod O
was O
very O
sad O
, O
but O
he O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
break O
the O
promise O
he O
had O
made O
to O
her O
in O
front O
of O
his O
guests O
. O

So O
he O
sent O
a O
soldier O
to O
cut O
off O
John O
's O
head O
and O
bring O
it O
to O
him O
. O

The O
soldier O
went O
and O
cut O
off O
John O
's O
head O
in O
the O
prison O
. O

He O
brought O
the O
head O
back O
on O
a O
plate O
and O
gave O
it O
to O
the O
girl O
, O
and O
the O
girl O
gave O
it O
to O
her O
mother O
. O

John O
's O
followers O
heard O
about O
what O
happened O
, O
so O
they O
came O
and O
got O
John O
's O
body O
and O
put O
it O
in O
a O
tomb O
. O

The O
apostles O
Jesus O
had O
sent O
out O
came O
back O
to O
him O
. O

They O
gathered O
around O
him O
and O
told O
him O
about O
all O
they O
had O
done O
and O
taught O
. O

Jesus O
and O
his O
followers O
were O
in O
a O
very O
busy O
place O
. O

There O
were O
so O
many O
people O
that O
he O
and O
his O
followers O
did O
not O
even O
have O
time O
to O
eat O
. O

He O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Come O
with O
me O
. O

We O
will O
go O
to O
a O
quiet O
place O
to O
be O
alone O
. O

There O
we O
will O
get O
some O
rest O
. O
'' O

So O
Jesus O
and O
his O
followers O
went O
away O
alone O
. O

They O
went O
in O
a O
boat O
to O
a O
place O
where O
no O
one O
lived O
. O

But O
many O
people O
saw O
them O
leave O
and O
knew O
who O
they O
were O
. O

So O
people O
from O
every O
town O
ran O
to O
the O
place O
where O
they O
were O
going O
and O
got O
there O
before O
Jesus O
. O

As O
Jesus O
stepped O
out O
of O
the O
boat O
, O
he O
saw O
a O
large O
crowd O
waiting O
. O

He O
felt O
sorry O
for O
them O
, O
because O
they O
were O
like O
sheep O
without O
a O
shepherd O
to O
care O
for O
them O
. O

So O
he O
taught O
the O
people O
many O
things O
. O

It O
was O
now O
very O
late O
in O
the O
day O
. O

Jesus O
' O
followers O
came O
to O
him O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
No O
one O
lives O
around O
here O
, O
and O
it O
is O
already O
very O
late O
. O

So O
send O
the O
people O
away O
. O

They O
need O
to O
go O
to O
the O
farms O
and O
towns O
around O
here O
to O
buy O
some O
food O
to O
eat O
. O
'' O

But O
Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
You O
give O
them O
some O
food O
to O
eat O
. O
'' O

They O
said O
to O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
We O
ca O
n't O
buy O
enough O
bread O
to O
feed O
all O
these O
people O
. O

We O
would O
all O
have O
to O
work O
a O
month O
to O
earn O
enough O
to O
buy O
that O
much O
bread O
! O
'' O

Jesus O
asked O
them O
, O
`` O
How O
many O
loaves O
of O
bread O
do O
you O
have O
now O
? O

Go O
and O
see O
. O
'' O

They O
counted O
their O
loaves O
of O
bread O
. O

They O
came O
to O
Jesus O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
We O
have O
five O
loaves O
of O
bread O
and O
two O
fish O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Tell O
everyone O
to O
sit O
in O
groups O
on O
the O
green O
grass O
. O
'' O

So O
all O
the O
people O
sat O
in O
groups O
. O

There O
were O
about O
50 O
or O
100 O
people O
in O
each O
group O
. O

Jesus O
took O
the O
five O
loaves O
and O
two O
fish O
. O

He O
looked O
up O
to O
the O
sky O
and O
thanked O
God O
for O
the O
food O
. O

Then O
he O
broke O
the O
bread O
into O
pieces O
, O
which O
he O
gave O
to O
his O
followers O
to O
distribute O
to O
the O
people O
. O

Then O
he O
divided O
the O
two O
fish O
among O
everyone O
there O
. O

They O
all O
ate O
until O
they O
were O
full O
. O

After O
they O
finished O
eating O
, O
the O
followers O
filled O
twelve O
baskets O
with O
the O
pieces O
of O
bread O
and O
fish O
that O
were O
left O
. O

There O
were O
about O
5000 O
men O
there O
who O
ate O
. O

Then O
Jesus O
told O
the O
followers O
to O
get O
into O
the O
boat O
. O

He O
told O
them O
to O
go O
to O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
lake O
to O
Bethsaida O
. O

He O
said O
he O
would O
come O
later O
. O

He O
stayed O
there O
to O
tell O
everyone O
they O
could O
go O
home O
. O

After O
he O
said O
goodbye O
to O
them O
, O
he O
went O
up O
into O
the O
hills O
to O
pray O
. O

That O
night O
, O
the O
boat O
was O
still O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
lake O
. O

Jesus O
was O
alone O
on O
the O
land O
. O

He O
saw O
the O
boat O
far O
away O
on O
the O
lake O
. O

And O
he O
saw O
the O
followers O
working O
hard O
to O
row O
the O
boat O
. O

The O
wind O
was O
blowing O
against O
them O
. O

Sometime O
between O
three O
and O
six O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
Jesus O
went O
out O
to O
the O
boat O
, O
walking O
on O
the O
water O
. O

He O
continued O
walking O
until O
he O
was O
almost O
past O
the O
boat O
. O

But O
the O
followers O
saw O
Jesus O
walking O
on O
the O
water O
. O

They O
thought O
he O
was O
a O
ghost O
, O
and O
they O
started O
screaming O
. O

It O
scared O
them O
all O
to O
see O
him O
. O

But O
he O
spoke O
to O
them O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
worry O
! O

It O
's O
me O
! O

Do O
n't O
be O
afraid O
. O
'' O

When O
he O
got O
into O
the O
boat O
with O
the O
followers O
, O
the O
wind O
stopped O
. O

The O
followers O
were O
completely O
amazed O
. O

They O
could O
not O
believe O
what O
happened O
. O

It O
was O
like O
the O
miracle O
he O
did O
with O
the O
bread O
. O

They O
still O
did O
n't O
understand O
what O
that O
meant O
. O

Jesus O
and O
his O
followers O
went O
across O
the O
lake O
and O
came O
to O
shore O
at O
Gennesaret O
. O

They O
tied O
the O
boat O
there O
. O

When O
they O
were O
out O
of O
the O
boat O
, O
the O
people O
there O
saw O
Jesus O
. O

They O
knew O
who O
he O
was O
, O
so O
they O
ran O
to O
tell O
others O
throughout O
that O
area O
. O

They O
brought O
sick O
people O
on O
mats O
to O
every O
place O
Jesus O
went O
. O

Jesus O
went O
into O
towns O
, O
cities O
, O
and O
farms O
around O
that O
area O
. O

And O
every O
place O
he O
went O
, O
the O
people O
brought O
sick O
people O
to O
the O
marketplaces O
. O

They O
begged O
him O
to O
let O
them O
touch O
any O
part O
of O
his O
coat O
. O

And O
all O
those O
who O
touched O
him O
were O
healed O
. O

Jesus O
was O
leaving O
the O
Temple O
area O
. O

One O
of O
his O
followers O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Teacher O
, O
look O
how O
big O
those O
stones O
are O
! O

What O
beautiful O
buildings O
! O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Do O
you O
see O
these O
great O
buildings O
? O

They O
will O
all O
be O
destroyed O
. O

Every O
stone O
will O
be O
thrown O
down O
to O
the O
ground O
. O

Not O
one O
stone O
will O
be O
left O
on O
another O

'' O

Later O
, O
Jesus O
was O
sitting O
at O
a O
place O
on O
the O
Mount O
of O
Olives O
. O

He O
was O
alone O
with O
Peter O
, O
James O
, O
John O
, O
and O
Andrew O
. O

They O
could O
all O
see O
the O
Temple O
, O
and O
they O
said O
to O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
Tell O
us O
when O
these O
things O
will O
happen O
. O

And O
what O
will O
show O
us O
it O
is O
time O
for O
them O
to O
happen O

'' O

Jesus O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Be O
careful O

Do O
n't O
let O
anyone O
fool O
you O

Many O

They O
will O
say O
, O
' O
I O
am O

will O
fool O
many O

you O
will O
hear O
stories O
about O

do O
n't O
be O
afraid O

These O
things O
must O
happen O
before O

end O
comes O

Nations O
will O
fight O
against O
other O

will O
fight O
against O

There O
will O
be O
times O
when O
there O
is O
no O
food O
for O
people O
to O
eat O
. O

And O
there O
will O
be O
earthquakes O
in O
different O
places O

These O
things O
are O
only O
the O
beginning O
of O
troubles O

of O
a O

`` O
No O

You O

`` O
It O
's O
like O
a O
man O

goes O
on O
a O
trip O
and O
leaves O
his O
house O
in O
the O
care O
of O
his O
servants O

He O
gives O
each O
one O
a O
special O
job O

do O

He O
tells O
the O
servant O
guarding O
the O
door O

always O

And O
this O
is O
what O
I O
am O
telling O
you O
now O

You O
must O
always O

You O
do O
n't O
know O
when O
the O
owner O
of O
the O
house O
will O
come O
back O

He O
might O
come O
in O
the O
afternoon O

at O
midnight O

in O
the O
early O
morning O

If O
you O

he O
will O
not O
find O
you O
sleeping O

even O
if O
he O
comes O
back O
earlier O
than O
expected O

I O
tell O
you O
this O

I O
say O
it O
to O
everyone O

The O
next O
day O
after O
the O
Sabbath O
day O
, O
Mary O
Magdalene O
, O
Salome O
, O
and O
Mary O
the O
mother O
of O
James O
bought O
some O
sweet O
- O
smelling O
spices O
to O
put O
on O
Jesus O
' O
body O
. O

Very O
early O
on O
that O
day O
, O
the O
first O
day O
of O
the O
week O
, O
the O
women O
were O
going O
to O
the O
tomb O
. O

It O
was O
very O
early O
after O
sunrise O
. O

The O
women O
said O
to O
each O
other O
, O
`` O
There O
is O
a O
large O
stone O
covering O
the O
entrance O
of O
the O
tomb O
. O

Who O
will O
move O
the O
stone O
for O
us O
? O
'' O

Then O
the O
women O
looked O
and O
saw O
that O
the O
stone O
was O
moved O
. O

The O
stone O
was O
very O
large O
, O
but O
it O
was O
moved O
away O
from O
the O
entrance O
. O

The O
women O
walked O
into O
the O
tomb O
and O
saw O
a O
young O
man O
there O
wearing O
a O
white O
robe O
. O

He O
was O
sitting O
on O
the O
right O
side O
of O
the O
tomb O
. O

The O
women O
were O
afraid O
. O

But O
the O
man O
said O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
be O
afraid O
. O

You O
are O
looking O
for O
Jesus O
from O
Nazareth O
, O
the O
one O
who O
was O
killed O
on O
a O
cross O
. O

He O
has O
risen O
from O
death O
! O

He O
is O
not O
here O
. O

Look O
, O
here O
is O
the O
place O
they O
put O
him O
when O
he O
was O
dead O
. O

Now O
go O
and O
tell O
his O
followers O
. O

And O
be O
sure O
to O
tell O
Peter O
. O

Tell O
them O
, O
' O
Jesus O
is O
going O
into O
Galilee O
and O
will O
be O
there O
before O
you O
come O
. O

You O
will O
see O
him O
there O
, O
as O
he O
told O
you O
before O
. O
' O
'' O

The O
women O
were O
very O
afraid O
and O
confused O
. O

They O
left O
the O
tomb O
and O
ran O
away O
. O

They O
did O
not O
tell O
about O
what O
happened O
, O
because O
they O
were O
afraid O
. O

Jesus O
rose O
from O
death O
early O
on O
the O
first O
day O
of O
the O
week O
. O

He O
appeared O
first O
to O
Mary O
Magdalene O
. O

One O
time O
in O
the O
past O
Jesus O
had O
forced O
seven O
demons O
out O
of O
Mary O
. O

After O
Mary O
saw O
Jesus O
, O
she O
went O
and O
told O
his O
followers O
. O

They O
were O
very O
sad O
and O
were O
crying O
. O

But O
Mary O
told O
them O
that O
Jesus O
was O
alive O
. O

She O
said O
that O
she O
had O
seen O
Jesus O
, O
but O
they O
did O
not O
believe O
her O
. O

Later O
, O
Jesus O
appeared O
to O
two O
followers O
while O
they O
were O
walking O
in O
the O
country O
. O

But O
Jesus O
did O
not O
look O
the O
same O
as O
before O
he O
was O
killed O
. O

These O
followers O
went O
back O
to O
the O
other O
followers O
and O
told O
them O
what O
happened O
. O

Again O
, O
the O
followers O
did O
not O
believe O
them O
. O

Later O
, O
Jesus O
appeared O
to O
the O
eleven O
followers O
while O
they O
were O
eating O
. O

He O
criticized O
them O
because O
they O
had O
so O
little O
faith O
. O

They O
were O
stubborn O
and O
refused O
to O
believe O
the O
people O
who O
said O
Jesus O
had O
risen O
from O
death O
. O

He O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Go O
everywhere O
in O
the O
world O
. O

Tell O
the O
Good O
News O
to O
everyone O
. O

Whoever O
believes O
and O
is O
baptized O
will O
be O
saved O
. O

But O
those O
who O
do O
not O
believe O
will O
be O
judged O
guilty O
. O

And O
the O
people O
who O
believe O
will O
be O
able O
to O
do O
these O
things O
as O
proof O
: O
They O
will O
use O
my O
name O
to O
force O
demons O
out O
of O
people O
. O

They O
will O
speak O
in O
languages O
they O
never O
learned O
. O

If O
they O
pick O
up O
snakes O
or O
drink O
any O
poison O
, O
they O
will O
not O
be O
hurt O
. O

They O
will O
lay O
their O
hands O
on O
sick O
people O
, O
and O
they O
will O
get O
well O
. O
'' O

After O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
said O
these O
things O
to O
his O
followers O
, O
he O
was O
carried O
up O
into O
heaven O
. O

There O
, O
Jesus O
sat O
at O
the O
right O
side O
of O
God O
. O

The O
followers O
went O
everywhere O
in O
the O
world O
telling O
people O
the O
Good O
News O
, O
and O
the O
Lord O
helped O
them O
. O

By O
giving O
them O
power O
to O
do O
miracles O
the O
Lord O
proved O
that O
their O
message O
was O
true O
. O

Another O
time O
Jesus O
began O
teaching O
by O
the O
lake O
, O
and O
a O
large O
crowd O
gathered O
around O
him O
. O

He O
got O
into O
a O
boat O
so O
that O
he O
could O
sit O
and O
teach O
from O
the O
lake O
. O

All O
the O
people O
stayed O
on O
the O
shore O
near O
the O
water O
. O

Jesus O
used O
stories O
to O
teach O
them O
many O
things O
. O

One O
of O
his O
lessons O
included O
this O
story O
: O
`` O
Listen O
! O

A O
farmer O
went O
out O
to O
sow O
seed O
. O

While O
he O
was O
scattering O
the O
seed O
, O
some O
of O
it O
fell O
by O
the O
road O
. O

The O
birds O
came O
and O
ate O
all O
that O
seed O
. O

Other O
seed O
fell O
on O
rocky O
ground O
, O
where O
there O
was O
not O
enough O
dirt O
. O

It O
grew O
quickly O
there O
because O
the O
soil O
was O
not O
deep O
. O

But O
then O
the O
sun O
rose O
and O
the O
plants O
were O
burned O
. O

They O
died O
because O
they O
did O
not O
have O
deep O
roots O
. O

Some O
other O
seed O
fell O
among O
thorny O
weeds O
. O

The O
weeds O
grew O
and O
stopped O
the O
good O
plants O
from O
growing O
. O

So O
they O
did O
not O
make O
grain O
. O

But O
some O
of O
the O
seed O
fell O
on O
good O
ground O
. O

There O
it O
began O
to O
grow O
, O
and O
it O
made O
grain O
. O

Some O
plants O
made O
30 O
times O
more O
grain O
, O
some O
60 O
times O
more O
, O
and O
some O
100 O
times O
more O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
people O
who O
hear O
me O
, O
listen O
! O
'' O

Later O
, O
Jesus O
was O
away O
from O
the O
people O
. O

The O
twelve O
apostles O
and O
his O
other O
followers O
asked O
him O
about O
the O
stories O
. O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Only O
you O
can O
know O
the O
secret O
truth O
about O
God O
's O
kingdom O
. O

But O
to O
those O
other O
people O
I O
tell O
everything O
by O
using O
stories O
. O

I O
do O
this O
so O
that O
, O
' O
They O
will O
look O
and O
look O
but O
never O
really O
see O
; O
they O
will O
listen O
and O
listen O
but O
never O
understand O
. O

If O
they O
saw O
and O
understood O
, O
they O
might O
change O
and O
be O
forgiven O
. O
' O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
to O
the O
followers O
, O
`` O
Do O
you O
understand O
this O
story O
? O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
, O
how O
will O
you O
understand O
any O
story O
? O

The O
farmer O
is O
like O
someone O
who O
plants O
God O
's O
teaching O
in O
people O
. O

Sometimes O
the O
teaching O
falls O
on O
the O
path O
. O

That O
is O
like O
some O
people O
who O
hear O
the O
teaching O
of O
God O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
they O
hear O
it O
, O
Satan O
comes O
and O
takes O
away O
the O
teaching O
that O
was O
planted O
in O
them O
. O

`` O
Other O
people O
are O
like O
the O
seed O
planted O
on O
rocky O
ground O
. O

They O
hear O
the O
teaching O
, O
and O
they O
quickly O
and O
gladly O
accept O
it O
. O

But O
they O
do O
n't O
allow O
it O
to O
go O
deep O
into O
their O
lives O
. O

They O
keep O
it O
only O
a O
short O
time O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
trouble O
or O
persecution O
comes O
because O
of O
the O
teaching O
they O
accepted O
, O
they O
give O
up O
. O

`` O
Others O
are O
like O
the O
seed O
planted O
among O
the O
thorny O
weeds O
. O

They O
hear O
the O
teaching O
, O
but O
their O
lives O
become O
full O
of O
other O
things O
: O
the O
worries O
of O
this O
life O
, O
the O
love O
of O
money O
, O
and O
everything O
else O
they O
want O
. O

This O
keeps O
the O
teaching O
from O
growing O
, O
and O
it O
does O
not O
produce O
a O
crop O
in O
their O
lives O
. O

`` O
And O
others O
are O
like O
the O
seed O
planted O
on O
the O
good O
ground O
. O

They O
hear O
the O
teaching O
and O
accept O
it O
. O

Then O
they O
grow O
and O
produce O
a O
good O
crop O
-- O
sometimes O
30 O
times O
more O
, O
sometimes O
60 O
times O
more O
, O
and O
sometimes O
100 O
times O
more O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
You O
do O
n't O
take O
a O
lamp O
and O
hide O
it O
under O
a O
bowl O
or O
a O
bed O
, O
do O
you O
? O

Of O
course O
not O
. O

You O
put O
it O
on O
a O
lampstand O
. O

Everything O
that O
is O
hidden O
will O
be O
made O
clear O
. O

Every O
secret O
thing O
will O
be O
made O
known O
. O

You O
people O
who O
hear O
me O
, O
listen O
! O

Think O
carefully O
about O
what O
you O
are O
hearing O
. O

God O
will O
know O
how O
much O
to O
give O
you O
by O
how O
much O
you O
understand O
now O
. O

But O
he O
will O
give O
you O
more O
than O
you O
deserve O
. O

The O
people O
who O
have O
some O
understanding O
will O
receive O
more O
. O

But O
those O
who O
do O
not O
have O
much O
will O
lose O
even O
the O
small O
amount O
they O
have O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
God O
's O
kingdom O
is O
like O
a O
man O
who O
plants O
seed O
in O
the O
ground O
. O

The O
seed O
begins O
to O
grow O
. O

It O
grows O
night O
and O
day O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
matter O
whether O
the O
man O
is O
sleeping O
or O
awake O
, O
the O
seed O
still O
grows O
. O

He O
does O
n't O
know O
how O
it O
happens O
. O

Without O
any O
help O
the O
ground O
produces O
grain O
. O

First O
the O
plant O
grows O
, O
then O
the O
head O
, O
and O
then O
all O
the O
grain O
in O
the O
head O
. O

When O
the O
grain O
is O
ready O
, O
the O
man O
cuts O
it O
. O

This O
is O
the O
harvest O
time O

'' O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
What O
can O
I O
use O
to O
show O
you O
what O
God O
's O
kingdom O
is O
like O
? O

What O
story O
can O
I O
use O
to O
explain O
it O
? O

God O
's O
kingdom O
is O
like O
a O
mustard O
seed O
, O
which O
is O
smaller O
than O
any O
other O
seed O
on O
earth O
that O
you O
can O
plant O
. O

But O
when O
you O
plant O
it O
, O
it O
grows O
and O
becomes O
the O
largest O
of O
all O
the O
plants O
in O
your O
garden O
. O

It O
has O
branches O
that O
are O
very O
big O
. O

The O
wild O
birds O
can O
come O
and O
make O
nests O
there O
and O
be O
protected O
from O
the O
sun O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
used O
many O
stories O
like O
these O
to O
teach O
the O
people O
. O

He O
taught O
them O
all O
they O
could O
understand O
. O

He O
always O
used O
stories O
to O
teach O
them O
. O

But O
when O
he O
was O
alone O
with O
his O
followers O
, O
Jesus O
explained O
everything O
to O
them O
. O

That O
day O
, O
at O
evening O
, O
Jesus O
said O
to O
his O
followers O
, O
`` O
Come O
with O
me O
across O
the O
lake O
. O
'' O

So O
they O
left O
the O
crowd O
behind O
and O
went O
with O
Jesus O
in O
the O
boat O
he O
was O
already O
in O
. O

There O
were O
also O
other O
boats O
that O
went O
with O
them O
. O

A O
very O
bad O
wind O
came O
up O
on O
the O
lake O
. O

The O
waves O
were O
coming O
over O
the O
sides O
and O
into O
the O
boat O
, O
and O
it O
was O
almost O
full O
of O
water O
. O

Jesus O
was O
inside O
the O
boat O
, O
sleeping O
with O
his O
head O
on O
a O
pillow O
. O

The O
followers O
went O
and O
woke O
him O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Teacher O
, O
do O
n't O
you O
care O
about O
us O
? O

We O
are O
going O
to O
drown O
! O
'' O

Jesus O
stood O
up O
and O
gave O
a O
command O
to O
the O
wind O
and O
the O
water O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Quiet O
! O

Be O
still O
! O
'' O

Then O
the O
wind O
stopped O
, O
and O
the O
lake O
became O
calm O
. O

He O
said O
to O
his O
followers O
, O
`` O
Why O
are O
you O
afraid O
? O

Do O
you O
still O
have O
no O
faith O
? O
'' O

They O
were O
very O
afraid O
and O
asked O
each O
other O
, O
`` O
What O
kind O
of O
man O
is O
this O
? O

Even O
the O
wind O
and O
the O
water O
obey O
him O
! O
'' O

Jesus O
and O
his O
followers O
were O
coming O
closer O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

They O
came O
to O
the O
towns O
of O
Bethphage O
and O
Bethany O
at O
the O
Mount O
of O
Olives O
. O

There O
Jesus O
sent O
two O
of O
his O
followers O
to O
do O
something O
. O

He O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Go O
to O
the O
town O
you O
can O
see O
there O

When O
you O
enter O
it O
, O
you O
will O
find O
a O
young O
donkey O
that O
no O
one O

ridden O

Untie O
it O

bring O
it O
here O
to O
me O

If O
anyone O
asks O
you O
why O
you O
are O
taking O
the O
donkey O
, O
tell O
them O
, O
' O
The O
Master O
needs O
it O
. O

He O
will O
send O
it O
back O
soon O
. O
' O
'' O

The O
followers O
went O
into O
the O
town O
. O

They O
found O
a O
young O
donkey O
tied O
in O
the O
street O
near O
the O
door O
of O
a O
house O
, O
and O
they O
untied O
it O
. O

Some O
people O
were O
standing O
there O
and O
saw O
this O
. O

They O
asked O
, O
`` O
What O
are O
you O
doing O
? O

Why O
are O
you O
untying O
that O
donkey O
? O
'' O

The O
followers O
answered O
the O
way O
Jesus O
told O
them O
, O
and O
the O
people O
let O
them O
take O
the O
donkey O
. O

The O
followers O
brought O
the O
donkey O
to O
Jesus O
. O

They O
put O
their O
coats O
on O
it O
, O
and O
Jesus O
sat O
on O
it O
. O

Many O
people O
spread O
their O
coats O
on O
the O
road O
for O
Jesus O
. O

Others O
cut O
branches O
in O
the O
fields O
and O
spread O
the O
branches O
on O
the O
road O
. O

Some O
of O
them O
were O
walking O
ahead O
of O
Jesus O
. O

Others O
were O
walking O
behind O
him O
. O

Everyone O
shouted O
, O
`` O
' O
Praise O
Him O
! O
' O
' O

Welcome O
! O

God O
bless O
the O
one O
who O
comes O
in O
the O
name O
of O
the O
Lord O
! O
' O

`` O
God O
bless O
the O
kingdom O
of O
our O
father O
David O
. O

That O
kingdom O
is O
coming O
! O

Praise O
to O
God O
in O
heaven O
! O
'' O

Jesus O
entered O
Jerusalem O
and O
went O
to O
the O
Temple O
. O

He O
looked O
at O
everything O
in O
the O
Temple O
area O
, O
but O
it O
was O
already O
late O
. O

So O
he O
went O
to O
Bethany O
with O
the O
twelve O
apostles O
. O

The O
next O
day O
, O
Jesus O
was O
leaving O
Bethany O
. O

He O
was O
hungry O
. O

He O
saw O
a O
fig O
tree O
with O
leaves O
. O

So O
he O
went O
to O
the O
tree O
to O
see O
if O
it O
had O
any O
figs O
growing O
on O
it O
. O

But O
he O
found O
no O
figs O
on O
the O
tree O
. O

There O
were O
only O
leaves O
, O
because O
it O
was O
not O
the O
right O
time O
for O
figs O
to O
grow O
. O

So O
Jesus O
said O
to O
the O
tree O
, O
`` O
People O
will O
never O
eat O
fruit O
from O
you O
again O
. O
'' O

His O
followers O
heard O
him O
say O
this O
. O

Jesus O
went O
to O
Jerusalem O
and O
entered O
the O
Temple O
area O
. O

He O
began O
driving O
out O
the O
people O
who O
were O
buying O
and O
selling O
things O
there O
. O

He O
turned O
over O
the O
tables O
that O
belonged O
to O
those O
who O
were O
exchanging O
different O
kinds O
of O
money O
. O

And O
he O
turned O
over O
the O
benches O
of O
those O
who O
were O
selling O
doves O
. O

He O
refused O
to O
allow O
anyone O
to O
carry O
things O
through O
the O
Temple O
area O
. O

Then O
Jesus O
began O
teaching O
the O
people O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
It O
is O
written O
in O
the O
Scriptures O
, O
' O
My O
Temple O
will O
be O
called O
a O
house O
of O
prayer O
for O
all O
nations O
. O
' O

But O
you O
have O
changed O
it O
into O
a O
' O
hiding O
place O
for O
thieves O
. O
' O
'' O

When O
the O
leading O
priests O
and O
the O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
heard O
what O
Jesus O
said O
, O
they O
began O
trying O
to O
find O
a O
way O
to O
kill O
him O
. O

They O
were O
afraid O
of O
him O
because O
all O
the O
people O
were O
amazed O
at O
his O
teaching O
. O

That O
night O
Jesus O
and O
his O
followers O
left O
the O
city O
. O

The O
next O
morning O
Jesus O
was O
walking O
with O
his O
followers O
. O

They O
saw O
the O
fig O
tree O
that O
he O
spoke O
to O
the O
day O
before O
. O

The O
tree O
was O
dry O
and O
dead O
, O
even O
the O
roots O
. O

Peter O
remembered O
the O
tree O
and O
said O
to O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
Teacher O
, O
look O
! O

Yesterday O
, O
you O
told O
that O
fig O
tree O
to O
die O
. O

Now O
it O
is O
dry O
and O
dead O
! O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
Have O
faith O
in O
God O
. O

The O
truth O
is O
, O
you O
can O
say O
to O
this O
mountain O
, O
' O
Go O
, O
mountain O
, O
fall O
into O
the O
sea O
. O
' O

And O
if O
you O
have O
no O
doubts O
in O
your O
mind O
and O
believe O
that O
what O
you O
say O
will O
happen O
, O
then O
God O
will O
do O
it O
for O
you O
. O

So O
I O
tell O
you O
to O
ask O
for O
what O
you O
want O
in O
prayer O
. O

And O
if O
you O
believe O
that O
you O
have O
received O
those O
things O
, O
then O
they O
will O
be O
yours O
. O

When O
you O
are O
praying O
, O
and O
you O
remember O
that O
you O
are O
angry O
with O
another O
person O
about O
something O
, O
then O
forgive O
that O
person O
. O

Forgive O
them O
so O
that O
your O
Father O
in O
heaven O
will O
also O
forgive O
your O
sins O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
and O
his O
followers O
went O
again O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

Jesus O
was O
walking O
in O
the O
Temple O
area O
. O

The O
leading O
priests O
, O
the O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
, O
and O
the O
older O
Jewish O
leaders O
came O
to O
him O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Tell O
us O
! O

What O
authority O
do O
you O
have O
to O
do O
these O
things O
? O

Who O
gave O
you O
this O
authority O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
will O
ask O
you O
a O
question O
. O

You O
answer O
my O
question O

Then O
I O
will O
tell O
you O
whose O
authority O
I O
use O
to O
do O
these O
things O
. O

Tell O
me O
: O
When O
John O
baptized O
people O
, O
did O
his O
authority O
come O
from O
God O
or O
was O
it O
only O
from O
other O
people O
? O

Answer O
me O
. O
'' O

These O
Jewish O
leaders O
talked O
about O
Jesus O
' O
question O
. O

They O
said O
to O
each O
other O
, O
`` O
If O
we O
answer O
, O
' O
John O
's O
baptism O
was O
from O
God O
, O
' O
then O
he O
will O
say O
, O
' O
Then O
why O
did O
n't O
you O
believe O
John O
? O
' O

But O
we O
ca O
n't O
say O
that O
John O
's O
baptism O
was O
from O
someone O
else O
. O
'' O

-LRB- O
These O
leaders O
were O
afraid O
of O
the O
people O
, O
because O
the O
people O
believed O
that O
John O
was O
a O
prophet O
. O
-RRB- O

So O
the O
leaders O
answered O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
We O
do O
n't O
know O
the O
answer O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Then O
I O
will O
not O
tell O
you O
who O
gave O
me O
the O
authority O
to O
do O
these O
things O
. O
'' O

Another O
time O
Jesus O
went O
into O
the O
synagogue O
. O

In O
the O
synagogue O
there O
was O
a O
man O
with O
a O
crippled O
hand O
. O

Some O
Jews O
there O
were O
watching O
Jesus O
closely O
. O

They O
were O
waiting O
to O
see O
if O
he O
would O
heal O
the O
man O
on O
a O
Sabbath O
day O
. O

They O
wanted O
to O
see O
Jesus O
do O
something O
wrong O
so O
that O
they O
could O
accuse O
him O
. O

Jesus O
said O
to O
the O
man O
with O
the O
crippled O
hand O
, O
`` O
Stand O
up O
here O
so O
that O
everyone O
can O
see O
you O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
asked O
the O
people O
, O
`` O
Which O
is O
the O
right O
thing O
to O
do O
on O
the O
Sabbath O
day O
: O
to O
do O
good O
or O
to O
do O
evil O
? O

Is O
it O
right O
to O
save O
a O
life O
or O
to O
destroy O
one O
? O
'' O

The O
people O
said O
nothing O
to O
answer O
him O
. O

Jesus O
looked O
at O
the O
people O
. O

He O
was O
angry O
, O
but O
he O
felt O
very O
sad O
because O
they O
were O
so O
stubborn O
. O

He O
said O
to O
the O
man O
, O
`` O
Hold O
out O
your O
hand O
. O
'' O

The O
man O
held O
out O
his O
hand O
, O
and O
it O
was O
healed O
. O

Then O
the O
Pharisees O
left O
and O
made O
plans O
with O
the O
Herodians O
about O
a O
way O
to O
kill O
Jesus O
. O

Jesus O
went O
away O
with O
his O
followers O
to O
the O
lake O
. O

A O
large O
crowd O
of O
people O
from O
Galilee O
followed O
them O
. O

Many O
also O
came O
from O
Judea O
, O
from O
Jerusalem O
, O
from O
Idumea O
, O
from O
the O
area O
across O
the O
Jordan O
River O
, O
and O
from O
the O
area O
around O
Tyre O
and O
Sidon O
. O

These O
people O
came O
because O
they O
heard O
about O
all O
that O
Jesus O
was O
doing O
. O

Jesus O
saw O
how O
many O
people O
there O
were O
, O
so O
he O
told O
his O
followers O
to O
get O
a O
small O
boat O
and O
make O
it O
ready O
for O
him O
. O

He O
wanted O
the O
boat O
so O
that O
the O
crowds O
of O
people O
could O
not O
push O
against O
him O
. O

He O
had O
healed O
many O
of O
them O
, O
so O
all O
the O
sick O
people O
were O
pushing O
toward O
him O
to O
touch O
him O
. O

Some O
people O
had O
evil O
spirits O
inside O
them O
. O

When O
the O
evil O
spirits O
saw O
Jesus O
, O
they O
bowed O
before O
him O
and O
shouted O
, O
`` O
You O
are O
the O
Son O
of O
God O
! O
'' O

But O
Jesus O
gave O
the O
spirits O
a O
strong O
warning O
not O
to O
tell O
anyone O
who O
he O
was O
. O

Then O
Jesus O
went O
up O
on O
a O
hill O
and O
invited O
those O
he O
wanted O
to O
go O
with O
him O
. O

So O
they O
joined O
him O
there O
. O

And O
he O
chose O
twelve O
men O
and O
called O
them O
apostles O
. O

He O
wanted O
these O
twelve O
men O
to O
be O
with O
him O
, O
and O
he O
wanted O
to O
send O
them O
to O
other O
places O
to O
tell O
people O
God O
's O
message O
. O

He O
also O
wanted O
them O
to O
have O
the O
power O
to O
force O
demons O
out O
of O
people O
. O

These O
are O
the O
names O
of O
the O
twelve O
men O
Jesus O
chose O
: O

Simon O
-LRB- O
the O
one O
Jesus O
named O
Peter O
-RRB- O
, O
James O
and O
his O
brother O
John O
, O
the O
sons O
of O
Zebedee O
-LRB- O
the O
ones O
Jesus O
named O
Boanerges O
, O
which O
means O
`` O
Sons O
of O
Thunder O
'' O
-RRB- O
, O
Andrew O
, O
Philip O
, O
Bartholomew O
, O
Matthew O
, O
Thomas O
, O
James O
, O
the O
son O
of O
Alphaeus O
, O
Thaddaeus O
, O
Simon O
, O
the O
Zealot O
, O
Judas O
Iscariot O
-LRB- O
the O
one O
who O
handed O
Jesus O
over O
to O
his O
enemies O
-RRB- O
. O

Then O
Jesus O
went O
home O
, O
but O
again O
a O
large O
crowd O
gathered O
there O
. O

There O
were O
so O
many O
people O
that O
he O
and O
his O
followers O
could O
not O
eat O
. O

His O
family O
heard O
about O
all O
these O
things O
. O

They O
went O
to O
get O
him O
because O
people O
said O
he O
was O
crazy O
. O

And O
the O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
from O
Jerusalem O
said O
, O
`` O
Satan O
is O
living O
inside O
him O
! O

He O
uses O
power O
from O
the O
ruler O
of O
demons O
to O
force O
demons O
out O
of O
people O
. O
'' O

So O
Jesus O
called O
them O
together O
and O
talked O
to O
them O
using O
some O
stories O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Satan O
will O
not O
force O
his O
own O
demons O
out O
of O
people O
. O

A O
kingdom O
that O
fights O
against O
itself O
will O
not O
survive O
. O

And O
a O
family O
that O
is O
divided O
will O
not O
survive O
. O

If O
Satan O
is O
against O
himself O
and O
is O
fighting O
against O
his O
own O
people O
, O
he O
will O
not O
survive O
. O

That O
would O
be O
the O
end O
of O
Satan O
. O

`` O
Whoever O
wants O
to O
enter O
a O
strong O
man O
's O
house O
and O
steal O
his O
things O
must O
first O
tie O
him O
up O
. O

Then O
they O
can O
steal O
the O
things O
from O
his O
house O
. O

`` O
I O
want O
you O
to O
know O
that O
people O
can O
be O
forgiven O
for O
all O
the O
sinful O
things O
they O
do O
. O

They O
can O
even O
be O
forgiven O
for O
the O
bad O
things O
they O
say O
against O
God O
. O

But O
anyone O
who O
speaks O
against O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
will O
never O
be O
forgiven O
. O

They O
will O
always O
be O
guilty O
of O
that O
sin O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
this O
because O
the O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
had O
accused O
him O
of O
having O
an O
evil O
spirit O
inside O
him O
. O

Then O
Jesus O
' O
mother O
and O
brothers O
came O
. O

They O
stood O
outside O
and O
sent O
someone O
in O
to O
tell O
him O
to O
come O
out O
. O

Many O
people O
were O
sitting O
around O
Jesus O
. O

They O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Your O
mother O
and O
brothers O
are O
waiting O
for O
you O
outside O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
asked O
, O
`` O
Who O
is O
my O
mother O
? O

Who O
are O
my O
brothers O
? O
'' O

Then O
he O
looked O
at O
the O
people O
sitting O
around O
him O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
These O
people O
are O
my O
mother O
and O
my O
brothers O
! O

My O
true O
brother O
and O
sister O
and O
mother O
are O
those O
who O
do O
what O
God O
wants O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
and O
his O
followers O
went O
across O
the O
lake O
to O
the O
area O
where O
the O
Gerasene O
people O
lived O
. O

When O
Jesus O
got O
out O
of O
the O
boat O
, O
a O
man O
came O
to O
him O
from O
the O
caves O
where O
the O
dead O
are O
buried O
. O

This O
man O
had O
an O
evil O
spirit O
living O
inside O
him O
. O

He O
lived O
in O
the O
burial O
caves O
. O

No O
one O
could O
keep O
him O
tied O
up O
, O
even O
with O
chains O
. O

Many O
times O
people O
had O
put O
chains O
on O
his O
hands O
and O
feet O
, O
but O
he O
broke O
the O
chains O
. O

No O
one O
was O
strong O
enough O
to O
control O
him O
. O

Day O
and O
night O
he O
stayed O
around O
the O
burial O
caves O
and O
on O
the O
hills O
. O

He O
would O
scream O
and O
cut O
himself O
with O
rocks O
. O

While O
Jesus O
was O
still O
far O
away O
, O
the O
man O
saw O
him O
. O

He O
ran O
to O
Jesus O
and O
bowed O
down O
before O
him O
. O

As O
Jesus O
was O
saying O
, O
`` O
You O
evil O
spirit O
, O
come O
out O
of O
this O
man O
, O
'' O
the O
man O
shouted O
loudly O
, O
`` O
What O
do O
you O
want O
with O
me O
, O
Jesus O
, O
Son O
of O
the O
Most O
High O
God O
? O

I O
beg O
you O
in O
God O
's O
name O
not O
to O
punish O
me O

'' O

Then O
Jesus O
asked O
the O
man O
, O
`` O
What O
is O
your O
name O
? O
'' O

The O
man O
answered O
, O
`` O
My O
name O
is O
Legion O
, O
because O
there O
are O
many O
spirits O
inside O
me O

'' O

The O
spirits O
inside O
the O
man O
begged O
Jesus O
again O
and O
again O
not O
to O
send O
them O
out O
of O
that O
area O
. O

A O
large O
herd O
of O
pigs O
was O
eating O
on O
a O
hill O
near O
there O
. O

The O
evil O
spirits O
begged O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
Send O
us O
to O
the O
pigs O
. O

Let O
us O
go O
into O
them O
. O
'' O

So O
Jesus O
allowed O
them O
to O
do O
this O
. O

The O
evil O
spirits O
left O
the O
man O
and O
went O
into O
the O
pigs O
. O

Then O
the O
herd O
of O
pigs O
ran O
down O
the O
hill O
and O
into O
the O
lake O
. O

They O
were O
all O
drowned O
. O

There O
were O
about O
2000 O
pigs O
in O
that O
herd O
. O

The O
men O
who O
had O
the O
work O
of O
caring O
for O
the O
pigs O
ran O
away O
. O

They O
ran O
to O
the O
town O
and O
to O
the O
farms O
and O
told O
everyone O
what O
happened O
. O

The O
people O
went O
out O
to O
see O
. O

They O
came O
to O
Jesus O
, O
and O
they O
saw O
the O
man O
who O
had O
the O
many O
evil O
spirits O
. O

He O
was O
sitting O
down O
and O
was O
wearing O
clothes O
. O

He O
was O
in O
his O
right O
mind O
again O
. O

When O
they O
saw O
this O
, O
they O
were O
afraid O
. O

Those O
who O
had O
seen O
what O
Jesus O
did O
told O
the O
others O
what O
happened O
to O
the O
man O
who O
had O
the O
demons O
living O
in O
him O
. O

And O
they O
also O
told O
about O
the O
pigs O
. O

Then O
the O
people O
began O
to O
beg O
Jesus O
to O
leave O
their O
area O
. O

Jesus O
was O
preparing O
to O
leave O
in O
the O
boat O
. O

The O
man O
who O
was O
now O
free O
from O
the O
demons O
begged O
to O
go O
with O
him O
. O

But O
Jesus O
did O
not O
allow O
the O
man O
to O
go O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Go O
home O
to O
your O
family O
and O
friends O
. O

Tell O
them O
about O
all O
that O
the O
Lord O
did O
for O
you O
. O

Tell O
them O
how O
the O
Lord O
was O
good O
to O
you O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
man O
left O
and O
told O
the O
people O
in O
the O
Ten O
Towns O
about O
the O
great O
things O
Jesus O
did O
for O
him O
. O

Everyone O
was O
amazed O
. O

Jesus O
went O
back O
to O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
lake O
in O
the O
boat O
. O

There O
, O
a O
large O
crowd O
of O
people O
gathered O
around O
him O
on O
the O
shore O
. O

A O
leader O
of O
the O
synagogue O
came O
. O

His O
name O
was O
Jairus O
. O

He O
saw O
Jesus O
and O
bowed O
down O
before O
him O
. O

He O
begged O
Jesus O
again O
and O
again O
, O
saying O
, O
`` O
My O
little O
daughter O
is O
dying O
. O

Please O
come O
and O
lay O
your O
hands O
on O
her O
. O

Then O
she O
will O
be O
healed O
and O
will O
live O
. O
'' O

So O
Jesus O
went O
with O
Jairus O
. O

Many O
people O
followed O
Jesus O
. O

They O
were O
pushing O
very O
close O
around O
him O
. O

There O
among O
the O
people O
was O
a O
woman O
who O
had O
been O
bleeding O
for O
the O
past O
twelve O
years O
. O

She O
had O
suffered O
very O
much O
. O

Many O
doctors O
had O
tried O
to O
help O
her O
, O
and O
all O
the O
money O
she O
had O
was O
spent O
, O
but O
she O
was O
not O
improving O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
her O
sickness O
was O
getting O
worse O
. O

The O
woman O
heard O
about O
Jesus O
, O
so O
she O
followed O
him O
with O
the O
other O
people O
and O
touched O
his O
coat O
. O

She O
thought O
, O
`` O
If O
I O
can O
just O
touch O
his O
clothes O
, O
that O
will O
be O
enough O
to O
heal O
me O
. O
'' O

As O
soon O
as O
she O
touched O
his O
coat O
, O
her O
bleeding O
stopped O
. O

She O
felt O
that O
her O
body O
was O
healed O
from O
all O
the O
suffering O
. O

Jesus O
immediately O
felt O
power O
go O
out O
from O
him O
, O
so O
he O
stopped O
and O
turned O
around O
. O

`` O
Who O
touched O
my O
clothes O
? O
'' O

he O
asked O
. O

The O
followers O
said O
to O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
There O
are O
so O
many O
people O
pushing O
against O
you O
. O

But O
you O
ask O
, O
' O
Who O
touched O
me O
? O
' O
'' O

But O
Jesus O
continued O
looking O
for O
the O
one O
who O
touched O
him O
. O

The O
woman O
knew O
that O
she O
was O
healed O
, O
so O
she O
came O
and O
bowed O
at O
Jesus O
' O
feet O
. O

She O
was O
shaking O
with O
fear O
. O

She O
told O
Jesus O
the O
whole O
story O
. O

He O
said O
to O
her O
, O
`` O
Dear O
woman O
, O
you O
are O
made O
well O
because O
you O
believed O
. O

Go O
in O
peace O
. O

You O
will O
not O
suffer O
anymore O
. O
'' O

While O
Jesus O
was O
still O
there O
speaking O
, O
some O
men O
came O
from O
the O
house O
of O
Jairus O
, O
the O
synagogue O
leader O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Your O
daughter O
is O
dead O
. O

There O
is O
no O
need O
to O
bother O
the O
Teacher O
. O
'' O

But O
Jesus O
did O
not O
care O
what O
the O
men O
said O
. O

He O
said O
to O
the O
synagogue O
leader O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
be O
afraid O
; O
just O
believe O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
let O
only O
Peter O
, O
James O
, O
and O
John O
the O
brother O
of O
James O
go O
with O
him O
. O

They O
went O
to O
the O
synagogue O
leader O
's O
house O
, O
where O
Jesus O
saw O
many O
people O
crying O
loudly O
. O

There O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
confusion O
. O

He O
entered O
the O
house O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Why O
are O
you O
people O
crying O
and O
making O
so O
much O
noise O
? O

This O
child O
is O
not O
dead O
. O

She O
is O
only O
sleeping O
. O
'' O

But O
everyone O
laughed O
at O
him O
. O

Jesus O
told O
the O
people O
to O
leave O
the O
house O
. O

Then O
he O
went O
into O
the O
room O
where O
the O
child O
was O
. O

He O
brought O
the O
child O
's O
father O
and O
mother O
and O
his O
three O
followers O
into O
the O
room O
with O
him O
. O

Then O
Jesus O
held O
the O
girl O
's O
hand O
and O
said O
to O
her O
, O
`` O
Talitha O
, O
koum O
! O
'' O

-LRB- O
This O
means O
`` O
Little O
girl O
, O
I O
tell O
you O
to O
stand O
up O
! O
'' O

-RRB- O
The O
girl O
immediately O
stood O
up O
and O
began O
walking O
. O

-LRB- O
She O
was O
twelve O
years O
old O
. O
-RRB- O

The O
father O
and O
mother O
and O
the O
followers O
were O
amazed O
. O

Jesus O
gave O
the O
father O
and O
mother O
very O
strict O
orders O
not O
to O
tell O
people O
about O
this O
. O

Then O
he O
told O
them O
to O
give O
the O
girl O
some O
food O
to O
eat O
. O

Very O
early O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
the O
leading O
priests O
, O
the O
older O
Jewish O
leaders O
, O
the O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
, O
and O
the O
whole O
high O
council O
decided O
what O
to O
do O
with O
Jesus O
. O

They O
tied O
him O
, O
led O
him O
away O
, O
and O
handed O
him O
over O
to O
Governor O
Pilate O
. O

Pilate O
asked O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
Are O
you O
the O
king O
of O
the O
Jews O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
that O
is O
right O
. O
'' O

The O
leading O
priests O
accused O
Jesus O
of O
many O
things O
. O

So O
Pilate O
asked O
Jesus O
another O
question O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
can O
see O
that O
these O
people O
are O
accusing O
you O
of O
many O
things O
. O

Why O
do O
n't O
you O
answer O
? O
'' O

But O
Jesus O
still O
did O
not O
answer O
, O
and O
this O
really O
surprised O
Pilate O
. O

Every O
year O
at O
the O
Passover O
time O
the O
governor O
would O
free O
one O
prisoner O
-- O
whichever O
one O
the O
people O
wanted O
. O

There O
was O
a O
man O
in O
prison O
at O
that O
time O
named O
Barabbas O
. O

He O
and O
the O
rebels O
with O
him O
had O
been O
put O
in O
prison O
for O
committing O
murder O
during O
a O
riot O
. O

The O
people O
came O
to O
Pilate O
and O
asked O
him O
to O
free O
a O
prisoner O
as O
he O
always O
did O
. O

Pilate O
asked O
them O
, O
`` O
Do O
you O
want O
me O
to O
free O
the O
king O
of O
the O
Jews O
? O
'' O

Pilate O
knew O
that O
the O
leading O
priests O
had O
handed O
Jesus O
over O
to O
him O
because O
they O
were O
jealous O
of O
him O
. O

But O
the O
leading O
priests O
persuaded O
the O
people O
to O
ask O
Pilate O
to O
free O
Barabbas O
, O
not O
Jesus O
. O

Pilate O
asked O
the O
people O
again O
, O
`` O
So O
what O
should O
I O
do O
with O
this O
man O
you O
call O
the O
king O
of O
the O
Jews O
? O
'' O

The O
people O
shouted O
, O
`` O
Kill O
him O
on O
a O
cross O
! O
'' O

Pilate O
asked O
, O
`` O
Why O
? O

What O
wrong O
has O
he O
done O
? O
'' O

But O
the O
people O
shouted O
louder O
and O
louder O
, O
`` O
Kill O
him O
on O
a O
cross O
! O
'' O

Pilate O
wanted O
to O
please O
the O
people O
, O
so O
he O
set O
Barabbas O
free O
for O
them O
. O

And O
he O
told O
the O
soldiers O
to O
beat O
Jesus O
with O
whips O
. O

Then O
he O
handed O
him O
over O
to O
the O
soldiers O
to O
be O
killed O
on O
a O
cross O
. O

Pilate O
's O
soldiers O
took O
Jesus O
into O
the O
governor O
's O
palace O
-LRB- O
called O
the O
Praetorium O
-RRB- O
. O

They O
called O
all O
the O
other O
soldiers O
together O
. O

They O
put O
a O
purple O
robe O
on O
Jesus O
, O
made O
a O
crown O
from O
thorny O
branches O
, O
and O
put O
it O
on O
his O
head O
. O

Then O
they O
began O
shouting O
, O
`` O
Welcome O
, O
king O
of O
the O
Jews O
! O
'' O

They O
kept O
on O
beating O
his O
head O
with O
a O
stick O
and O
spitting O
on O
him O
. O

Then O
they O
bowed O
down O
on O
their O
knees O
and O
pretended O
to O
honor O
him O
as O
a O
king O
. O

After O
they O
finished O
making O
fun O
of O
him O
, O
they O
took O
off O
the O
purple O
robe O
and O
put O
his O
own O
clothes O
on O
him O
again O
. O

Then O
they O
led O
him O
out O
of O
the O
palace O
to O
be O
killed O
on O
a O
cross O
. O

There O
was O
a O
man O
from O
Cyrene O
named O
Simon O
walking O
into O
the O
city O
from O
the O
fields O
. O

He O
was O
the O
father O
of O
Alexander O
and O
Rufus O
. O

The O
soldiers O
forced O
him O
to O
carry O
Jesus O
' O
cross O
. O

They O
led O
Jesus O
to O
the O
place O
called O
Golgotha O
. O

-LRB- O
Golgotha O
means O
`` O
The O
Place O
of O
the O
Skull O
. O
'' O
-RRB- O

There O
they O
gave O
him O
some O
wine O
mixed O
with O
myrrh O
, O
but O
he O
refused O
to O
drink O
it O
. O

The O
soldiers O
nailed O
Jesus O
to O
a O
cross O
. O

Then O
they O
divided O
his O
clothes O
among O
themselves O
, O
throwing O
dice O
to O
see O
who O
would O
get O
what O
. O

It O
was O
nine O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning O
when O
they O
nailed O
Jesus O
to O
the O
cross O
. O

There O
was O
a O
sign O
with O
the O
charge O
against O
him O
written O
on O
it O
. O

It O
said O
, O
`` O
the O
king O
of O
the O
jews O
. O
'' O

They O
also O
nailed O
two O
criminals O
to O
crosses O
beside O
Jesus O
-- O
one O
on O
the O
right O
and O
the O
other O
on O
the O
left O
. O

People O
walked O
by O
and O
said O
bad O
things O
to O
Jesus O
. O

They O
shook O
their O
heads O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
said O
you O
could O
destroy O
the O
Temple O
and O
build O
it O
again O
in O
three O
days O

So O
save O
yourself O

Come O
down O
from O
that O
cross O
! O
'' O

The O
leading O
priests O
and O
the O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
were O
also O
there O
. O

They O
made O
fun O
of O
Jesus O
the O
same O
as O
the O
other O
people O
did O
. O

They O
said O
to O
each O
other O
, O
`` O
He O
saved O
others O
, O
but O
he O
ca O
n't O
save O
himself O

If O
he O
is O
really O
the O
Christ O
, O
the O
king O
of O
Israel O
, O
he O
should O
come O
down O
from O
the O
cross O
now O

When O
we O
see O
this O
, O
then O
we O
will O
believe O
in O
him O
. O
'' O

The O
criminals O
on O
the O
crosses O
beside O
Jesus O
also O
said O
bad O
things O
to O
him O
. O

At O
noon O
the O
whole O
country O
became O
dark O
. O

This O
darkness O
continued O
until O
three O
o'clock O
. O

At O
three O
o'clock O
Jesus O
cried O
out O
loudly O
, O
`` O
Eloi O
, O
Eloi O
, O
lama O
sabachthani O
. O
'' O

This O
means O
`` O
My O
God O
, O
my O
God O
, O
why O
have O
you O
left O
me O
alone O
? O
'' O

Some O
of O
the O
people O
standing O
there O
heard O
this O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Listen O
! O

He O
is O
calling O
Elijah O
. O
'' O

One O
man O
there O
ran O
and O
got O
a O
sponge O
. O

He O
filled O
the O
sponge O
with O
sour O
wine O
and O
tied O
it O
to O
a O
stick O
. O

Then O
he O
used O
the O
stick O
to O
give O
the O
sponge O
to O
Jesus O
to O
get O
a O
drink O
from O
it O
. O

The O
man O
said O

`` O
We O

see O
if O

will O
come O
to O
take O
him O
down O

Then O
Jesus O
cried O
out O
loudly O
and O
died O
. O

When O
Jesus O
died O
, O
the O
curtain O
in O
the O
Temple O
was O
torn O
into O
two O
pieces O
. O

The O
tear O
started O
at O
the O
top O
and O
tore O
all O
the O
way O

the O
bottom O

The O
army O

who O
was O
standing O
there O
in O
front O
of O
the O
cross O
saw O
what O
happened O
when O
Jesus O

The O
officer O
said O
, O
`` O
This O
man O
really O
was O
the O
Son O

Some O
women O
were O
standing O

It O

A O

high O
council O
. O

He O
was O
one O
of O
the O
people O
who O
wanted O
God O
's O
kingdom O
to O
come O
. O

Pilate O
was O
surprised O
to O
hear O
that O
Jesus O
was O
already O
dead O
. O

So O
he O
called O
for O
the O
army O
officer O
in O
charge O
and O
asked O
him O
if O
Jesus O
was O
already O
dead O
. O

When O
Pilate O
heard O
it O
from O
the O
officer O
, O
he O
told O
Joseph O
he O
could O
have O
the O
body O
. O

Joseph O
bought O
some O
linen O
cloth O
. O

He O
took O
the O
body O
from O
the O
cross O
, O
wrapped O
it O
in O
the O
linen O
, O
and O
put O
the O
body O
in O
a O
tomb O
that O
was O
dug O
in O
a O
wall O
of O
rock O
. O

Then O
he O
closed O
the O
tomb O
by O
rolling O
a O
large O
stone O
to O
cover O
the O
entrance O
. O

Mary O
Magdalene O
and O
Mary O
the O
mother O
of O
Joses O
saw O
the O
place O
where O
Jesus O
was O
put O
. O

Another O
time O
there O
were O
many O
people O
with O
Jesus O
. O

The O
people O
had O
nothing O
to O
eat O
. O

So O
he O
called O
his O
followers O
to O
him O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
feel O
sorry O
for O
these O
people O
. O

They O
have O
been O
with O
me O
for O
three O
days O
, O
and O
now O
they O
have O
nothing O
to O
eat O
. O

I O
should O
not O
send O
them O
home O
hungry O
. O

If O
they O
leave O
without O
eating O
, O
they O
will O
faint O
on O
the O
way O
home O
. O

Some O
of O
them O
live O
a O
long O
way O
from O
here O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
' O
followers O
answered O
, O
`` O
But O
we O
are O
far O
away O
from O
any O
towns O
. O

Where O
can O
we O
get O
enough O
bread O
to O
feed O
all O
these O
people O
? O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
asked O
them O
, O
`` O
How O
many O
loaves O
of O
bread O
do O
you O
have O
? O
'' O

They O
answered O
, O
`` O
We O
have O
seven O
loaves O
of O
bread O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
told O
the O
people O
to O
sit O
on O
the O
ground O
. O

Then O
he O
took O
the O
seven O
loaves O
and O
gave O
thanks O
to O
God O
. O

He O
broke O
the O
bread O
into O
pieces O
and O
gave O
them O
to O
his O
followers O
. O

He O
told O
them O
to O
give O
the O
bread O
to O
the O
people O
, O
and O
they O
did O
as O
he O
said O
. O

The O
followers O
also O
had O
a O
few O
small O
fish O
. O

Jesus O
gave O
thanks O
for O
the O
fish O
and O
told O
them O
to O
give O
the O
fish O
to O
the O
people O
. O

They O
all O
ate O
until O
they O
were O
full O
. O

Then O
the O
followers O
filled O
seven O
baskets O
with O
the O
pieces O
of O
food O
that O
were O
left O
. O

There O
were O
about O
4000 O
men O
who O
ate O
. O

After O
they O
ate O
, O
Jesus O
told O
them O
to O
go O
home O
. O

Then O
he O
went O
in O
a O
boat O
with O
his O
followers O
to O
the O
area O
of O
Dalmanutha O
. O

The O
Pharisees O
came O
to O
Jesus O
and O
asked O
him O
questions O
. O

They O
wanted O
to O
test O
him O
. O

So O
they O
asked O
him O
to O
do O
a O
miracle O
as O
a O
sign O
from O
God O
. O

Jesus O
sighed O
deeply O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Why O
do O
you O
people O
ask O
to O
see O
a O
miracle O
as O
a O
sign O
? O

I O
want O
you O
to O
know O
that O
no O
miracle O
will O
be O
done O
to O
prove O
anything O
to O
you O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
left O
them O
and O
went O
in O
the O
boat O
to O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
lake O
. O

The O
followers O
had O
only O
one O
loaf O
of O
bread O
with O
them O
in O
the O
boat O
. O

They O
forgot O
to O
bring O
more O
bread O
. O

Jesus O
warned O
them O
, O
`` O
Be O
careful O
! O

Guard O
against O
the O
yeast O
of O
the O
Pharisees O
and O
the O
yeast O
of O
Herod O
. O
'' O

The O
followers O
discussed O
the O
meaning O
of O
this O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
He O
said O
this O
because O
we O
have O
no O
bread O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
knew O
that O
the O
followers O
were O
talking O
about O
this O
. O

So O
he O
asked O
them O
, O
`` O
Why O
are O
you O
talking O
about O
having O
no O
bread O
? O

Do O
you O
still O
not O
see O
or O
understand O
? O

Are O
you O
not O
able O
to O
understand O
? O

Do O
you O
have O
eyes O
that O
ca O
n't O
see O
? O

Do O
you O
have O
ears O
that O
ca O
n't O
hear O
? O

Remember O
what O
I O
did O
before O
, O
when O
we O
did O
not O
have O
enough O
bread O
? O

I O
divided O
five O
loaves O
of O
bread O
for O
5000 O
people O
. O

Remember O
how O
many O
baskets O
you O
filled O
with O
pieces O
of O
food O
that O
were O
not O
eaten O
? O
'' O

The O
followers O
answered O
, O
`` O
We O
filled O
twelve O
baskets O
. O
'' O

`` O
And O
when O
I O
divided O
seven O
loaves O
of O
bread O
for O
4000 O
people O
, O
how O
many O
baskets O
did O
you O
fill O
with O
the O
leftover O
pieces O
? O
'' O

They O
answered O
, O
`` O
We O
filled O
seven O
baskets O
. O
'' O

Then O
he O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
You O
remember O
these O
things O
I O
did O
, O
but O
you O
still O
do O
n't O
understand O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
and O
his O
followers O
came O
to O
Bethsaida O
. O

Some O
people O
brought O
a O
blind O
man O
to O
him O
and O
begged O
him O
to O
touch O
the O
man O
. O

So O
Jesus O
held O
the O
blind O
man O
's O
hand O
and O
led O
him O
out O
of O
the O
village O
. O

Then O
he O
spit O
on O
the O
man O
's O
eyes O
. O

He O
laid O
his O
hands O
on O
him O
and O
asked O
, O
`` O
Can O
you O
see O
now O
? O
'' O

The O
man O
looked O
up O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
I O
see O
people O
. O

They O
look O
like O
trees O
walking O
around O
. O
'' O

Again O
Jesus O
laid O
his O
hands O
on O
the O
man O
's O
eyes O
, O
and O
the O
man O
opened O
them O
wide O
. O

His O
eyes O
were O
healed O
, O
and O
he O
was O
able O
to O
see O
everything O
clearly O
. O

Jesus O
told O
him O
to O
go O
home O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
go O
into O
the O
town O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
and O
his O
followers O
went O
to O
the O
towns O
in O
the O
area O
of O
Caesarea O
Philippi O
. O

While O
they O
were O
traveling O
, O
Jesus O
asked O
the O
followers O
, O
`` O
Who O
do O
people O
say O
I O
am O
? O
'' O

They O
answered O
, O
`` O
Some O
people O
say O
you O
are O
John O
the O
Baptizer O
. O

Others O
say O
you O
are O
Elijah O
. O

And O
others O
say O
you O
are O
one O
of O
the O
prophets O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
asked O
, O
`` O
Who O
do O
you O
say O
I O
am O
? O
'' O

Peter O
answered O
, O
`` O
You O
are O
the O
Christ O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
told O
the O
followers O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
tell O
anyone O
who O
I O
am O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
began O
to O
teach O
his O
followers O
that O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O
must O
suffer O
many O
things O
. O

He O
taught O
that O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O
would O
not O
be O
accepted O
by O
the O
older O
Jewish O
leaders O
, O
the O
leading O
priests O
, O
and O
the O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
. O

He O
said O
that O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O
must O
be O
killed O
and O
then O
rise O
from O
death O
after O
three O
days O
. O

Jesus O
told O
them O
everything O
that O
would O
happen O
. O

He O
did O
not O
keep O
anything O
secret O
. O

Peter O
took O
Jesus O
away O
from O
the O
other O
followers O
to O
talk O
to O
him O
alone O
. O

Peter O
criticized O
him O
for O
saying O
these O
things O
. O

But O
Jesus O
turned O
and O
looked O
at O
his O
followers O
. O

Then O
he O
criticized O
Peter O
. O

He O
said O
to O
Peter O
, O
`` O
Get O
away O
from O
me O
, O
Satan O
! O

You O
do O
n't O
care O
about O
the O
same O
things O
God O
does O
. O

You O
care O
only O
about O
things O
that O
people O
think O
are O
important O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
called O
the O
crowd O
and O
his O
followers O
to O
him O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Any O
of O
you O
who O
want O
to O
be O
my O
follower O
must O
stop O
thinking O
about O
yourself O
and O
what O
you O
want O
. O

You O
must O
be O
willing O
to O
carry O
the O
cross O
that O
is O
given O
to O
you O
for O
following O
me O
. O

Any O
of O
you O
who O
try O
to O
save O
the O
life O
you O
have O
will O
lose O
it O
. O

But O
you O
who O
give O
up O
your O
life O
for O
me O
and O
for O
the O
Good O
News O
will O
save O
it O
. O

It O
is O
worth O
nothing O
for O
you O
to O
have O
the O
whole O
world O
if O
you O
yourself O
are O
lost O
. O

You O
could O
never O
pay O
enough O
to O
buy O
back O
your O
life O
. O

People O
today O
are O
so O
sinful O
. O

They O
have O
not O
been O
faithful O
to O
God O
. O

As O
you O
live O
among O
them O
, O
do O
n't O
be O
ashamed O
of O
me O
and O
my O
teaching O
. O

If O
that O
happens O
, O
I O
will O
be O
ashamed O
of O
you O
when O
I O
come O
with O
the O
glory O
of O
my O
Father O
and O
the O
holy O
angels O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
used O
stories O
to O
teach O
the O
people O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
A O
man O
planted O
a O
vineyard O
. O

He O
put O
a O
wall O
around O
the O
field O
and O
dug O
a O
hole O
for O
a O
winepress O
. O

Then O
he O
built O
a O
tower O
. O

He O
leased O
the O
land O
to O
some O
farmers O
and O
left O
for O
a O
trip O
. O

`` O
Later O
, O
it O
was O
time O
for O
the O
grapes O
to O
be O
picked O
. O

So O
the O
man O
sent O
a O
servant O
to O
the O
farmers O
to O
get O
his O
share O
of O
the O
grapes O
. O

But O
the O
farmers O
grabbed O
the O
servant O
and O
beat O
him O
. O

They O
sent O
him O
away O
with O
nothing O
. O

Then O
the O
man O
sent O
another O
servant O
to O
the O
farmers O
. O

They O
hit O
this O
servant O
on O
the O
head O
, O
showing O
no O
respect O
for O
him O
. O

So O
the O
man O
sent O
another O
servant O
. O

The O
farmers O
killed O
this O
servant O
. O

The O
man O
sent O
many O
other O
servants O
to O
the O
farmers O
. O

The O
farmers O
beat O
some O
of O
them O
and O
killed O
the O
others O
. O

`` O
The O
man O
had O
only O
one O
person O
left O
to O
send O
to O
the O
farmers O
. O

It O
was O
his O
son O
. O

He O
loved O
his O
son O
, O
but O
he O
decided O
to O
send O
him O
. O

He O
said O
, O
' O
The O
farmers O
will O
respect O
my O
son O
. O
' O

`` O
But O
the O
farmers O
said O
to O
each O
other O
, O
' O
This O
is O
the O
owner O
's O
son O
, O
and O
this O
vineyard O
will O
be O
his O
. O

If O
we O
kill O
him O
, O
it O
will O
be O
ours O
. O
' O

So O
they O
took O
the O
son O
, O
threw O
him O
out O
of O
the O
vineyard O
, O
and O
killed O
him O
. O

`` O
So O
what O
will O
the O
man O
who O
owns O
the O
vineyard O
do O
? O

He O
will O
go O
and O
kill O
those O
farmers O
. O

Then O
he O
will O
lease O
the O
land O
to O
others O
. O

Surely O
you O
have O
read O
this O
in O
the O
Scriptures O
: O
' O
The O
stone O
that O
the O
builders O
refused O
to O
accept O
became O
the O
cornerstone O
. O

The O
Lord O
did O
this O
, O
and O
it O
is O
wonderful O
to O
us O
. O
' O
'' O

When O
these O
Jewish O
leaders O
heard O
this O
story O
, O
they O
knew O
it O
was O
about O
them O
. O

They O
wanted O
to O
find O
a O
way O
to O
arrest O
Jesus O
, O
but O
they O
were O
afraid O
of O
what O
the O
crowd O
would O
do O
. O

So O
they O
left O
him O
and O
went O
away O
. O

Later O
, O
the O
Jewish O
leaders O
sent O
some O
Pharisees O
and O
some O
men O
from O
the O
group O
called O
Herodians O
to O
Jesus O
. O

They O
wanted O
to O
catch O
him O
saying O
something O
wrong O
. O

They O
went O
to O
Jesus O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Teacher O
, O
we O
know O
that O
you O
are O
an O
honest O
man O

You O
are O
not O
afraid O
of O
what O
others O
think O
about O
you O

All O
people O
are O
the O
same O
to O
you O
. O

And O
you O
teach O
the O
truth O
about O
God O
's O
way O
. O

Tell O
us O
, O
is O
it O
right O
to O
pay O
taxes O
to O
Caesar O
? O

Should O
we O
pay O
them O
or O
not O
? O
'' O

But O
Jesus O
knew O
that O
these O
men O
were O
really O
trying O
to O
trick O
him O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Why O
are O
you O
trying O
to O
catch O
me O
saying O
something O
wrong O
? O

Bring O
me O
a O
silver O
coin O
. O

Let O
me O
see O
it O
. O
'' O

They O
gave O
Jesus O
a O
coin O
and O
he O
asked O
, O
`` O
Whose O
picture O
is O
on O
the O
coin O
? O

And O
whose O
name O
is O
written O
on O
it O
? O
'' O

They O
answered O
, O
`` O
It O
is O
Caesar O
's O
picture O
and O
Caesar O
's O
name O

'' O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Give O
to O
Caesar O
what O
belongs O
to O
Caesar O
, O
and O
give O
to O
God O
what O
belongs O

'' O

The O
men O
were O
amazed O
at O
what O
Jesus O
said O
. O

Then O
some O
Sadducees O
came O
to O
Jesus O
. O

-LRB- O
Sadducees O
believe O
that O
no O
one O
will O
rise O
from O
death O
. O
-RRB- O

They O
asked O
him O
a O
question O
: O
`` O
Teacher O
, O
Moses O
wrote O
that O
if O
a O
married O
man O
dies O
and O
had O
no O
children O
, O
his O
brother O
must O
marry O
the O
woman O
. O

Then O
they O
will O
have O
children O
for O
the O
dead O
brother O
. O

There O
were O
seven O
brothers O
. O

The O
first O
brother O
married O
but O
died O
. O

He O
had O
no O
children O
. O

So O
the O
second O
brother O
married O
the O
woman O

But O
he O
also O
died O
and O
had O
no O
children O

The O

thing O
happened O
with O
the O
third O
brother O

All O
seven O

married O
the O
woman O

died O

None O
of O
the O

had O
any O

And O
she O
was O
the O
last O
to O
die O

all O
seven O

had O
married O
her O

So O
at O
the O
time O
when O
people O
rise O
from O
death O
, O
whose O
wife O
will O
she O
be O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
How O
could O
you O
be O
so O
wrong O
? O

It O
's O
because O
you O
do O

know O
what O
the O

And O
you O
do O
n't O
know O
anything O
about O
God O
's O
power O
. O

When O
people O
rise O
from O
death O
, O
there O
will O
be O
no O
marriage O
. O

People O
will O
not O
be O
married O
to O
each O
other O
. O

All O
people O
will O
be O
like O
angels O
in O
heaven O
. O

Surely O
you O
have O
read O
what O
God O
said O
about O
people O
rising O
from O
death O
. O

In O
the O
book O
where O
Moses O
wrote O
about O
the O
burning O
bush O
, O
it O
says O
that O
God O
told O
Moses O
this O
: O
' O
I O
am O
the O
God O
of O
Abraham O
, O
the O
God O
of O
Isaac O
, O
and O
the O
God O
of O
Jacob O
. O
' O

So O
they O
were O
not O
still O
dead O
, O
because O
he O
is O
the O
God O
only O
of O
living O
people O
. O

You O
Sadducees O
are O
so O
wrong O
! O
'' O

One O
of O
the O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
came O
to O
Jesus O
. O

He O
heard O
Jesus O
arguing O
with O
the O
Sadducees O
and O
the O
Pharisees O
. O

He O
saw O
that O
Jesus O
gave O
good O
answers O
to O
their O
questions O
. O

So O
he O
asked O
him O
, O
`` O
Which O
of O
the O
commands O
is O
the O
most O
important O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
The O
most O
important O
command O
is O
this O
: O
' O
People O
of O
Israel O
, O
listen O
! O

The O
Lord O
our O
God O
is O
the O
only O
Lord O
. O

Love O
the O
Lord O
your O
God O
with O
all O
your O
heart O
, O
all O
your O
soul O
, O
all O
your O
mind O
, O
and O
all O
your O
strength O
. O
' O

The O
second O
most O
important O
command O
is O
this O
: O
' O
Love O
your O
neighbor O
the O
same O
as O
you O
love O
yourself O
. O
' O

These O
two O
commands O
are O
the O
most O
important O
. O
'' O

The O
man O
answered O
, O
`` O
That O
was O
a O
good O
answer O
, O
Teacher O
. O

You O
are O
right O
in O
saying O
that O
God O
is O
the O
only O
Lord O
and O
that O
there O
is O
no O
other O
God O
. O

And O
you O
must O
love O
God O
with O
all O
your O
heart O
, O
all O
your O
mind O
, O
and O
all O
your O
strength O
. O

And O
you O
must O
love O
others O
the O
same O
as O
you O
love O
yourself O
. O

These O
commands O
are O
more O
important O
than O
all O
the O
animals O
and O
sacrifices O
we O
offer O
to O
God O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
saw O
that O
the O
man O
answered O
him O
wisely O
. O

So O
he O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
You O
are O
close O
to O
God O
's O
kingdom O
. O
'' O

And O
after O
that O
time O
, O
no O
one O
was O
brave O
enough O
to O
ask O
Jesus O
any O
more O
questions O
. O

Jesus O
was O
teaching O
in O
the O
Temple O
area O
. O

He O
asked O
, O
`` O
Why O
do O
the O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
say O
that O
the O
Christ O
is O
the O
son O
of O
David O
? O

With O
the O
help O
of O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
, O
David O
himself O
says O
, O
' O
The O
Lord O
God O
said O
to O
my O
Lord O
: O
Sit O
by O
me O
at O
my O
right O
side O
, O
and O
I O
will O
put O
your O
enemies O
under O
your O
control O
. O
' O

David O
himself O
calls O
the O
Christ O
' O
Lord O
. O
' O

So O
how O
can O
the O
Christ O
be O
David O
's O
son O
? O
'' O

Many O
people O
listened O
to O
Jesus O
and O
were O
very O
pleased O
. O

Jesus O
continued O
teaching O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Be O
careful O
of O
the O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
. O

They O
like O
to O
walk O
around O
wearing O
clothes O
that O
look O
important O
. O

And O
they O
love O
for O
people O
to O
show O
respect O
to O
them O
in O
the O
marketplaces O
. O

They O
love O
to O
have O
the O
most O
important O
seats O
in O
the O
synagogues O
and O
the O
places O
of O
honor O
at O
banquets O
. O

But O
they O
cheat O
widows O
and O
take O
their O
homes O
. O

Then O
they O
try O
to O
make O
themselves O
look O
good O
by O
saying O
long O
prayers O
. O

God O
will O
punish O
them O
very O
much O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
sat O
near O
the O
Temple O
collection O
box O
and O
watched O
as O
people O
put O
money O
into O
it O
. O

Many O
rich O
people O
put O
in O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
. O

Then O
a O
poor O
widow O
came O
and O
put O
in O
two O
very O
small O
copper O
coins O
, O
worth O
less O
than O
a O
penny O
. O

Jesus O
called O
his O
followers O
to O
him O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
This O
poor O
widow O
put O
in O
only O
two O
small O
coins O
. O

But O
the O
truth O
is O
, O
she O
gave O
more O
than O
all O
those O
rich O
people O
. O

They O
have O
plenty O
, O
and O
they O
gave O
only O
what O
they O
did O
not O
need O
. O

This O
woman O
is O
very O
poor O
, O
but O
she O
gave O
all O
she O
had O
. O

It O
was O
money O
she O
needed O
to O
live O
on O
. O
'' O

A O
few O
days O
later O
, O
Jesus O
came O
back O
to O
Capernaum O
. O

The O
news O
spread O
that O
he O
was O
back O
home O
. O

A O
large O
crowd O
gathered O
to O
hear O
him O
speak O
. O

The O
house O
was O
so O
full O
that O
there O
was O
no O
place O
to O
stand O
, O
not O
even O
outside O
the O
door O
. O

While O
Jesus O
was O
teaching O
, O
some O
people O
brought O
a O
paralyzed O
man O
to O
see O
him O
. O

He O
was O
being O
carried O
by O
four O
of O
them O
. O

But O
they O
could O
not O
get O
the O
man O
inside O
to O
Jesus O
because O
the O
house O
was O
so O
full O
of O
people O
. O

So O
they O
went O
to O
the O
roof O
above O
Jesus O
and O
made O
a O
hole O
in O
it O
. O

Then O
they O
lowered O
the O
mat O
with O
the O
paralyzed O
man O
on O
it O
. O

When O
Jesus O
saw O
how O
much O
faith O
they O
had O
, O
he O
said O
to O
the O
paralyzed O
man O
, O
`` O
Young O
man O
, O
your O
sins O
are O
forgiven O
. O
'' O

Some O
of O
the O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
were O
sitting O
there O
. O

They O
saw O
what O
Jesus O
did O
, O
and O
they O
said O
to O
themselves O
, O
`` O
Why O
does O
this O
man O
say O
things O
like O
that O
? O

What O
an O
insult O
to O
God O
! O

No O
one O
but O
God O
can O
forgive O
sins O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
knew O
immediately O
what O
these O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
were O
thinking O
. O

So O
he O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Why O
do O
you O
have O
these O
questions O
in O
your O
minds O
? O

The O
Son O
of O
Man O
has O
power O
on O
earth O
to O
forgive O
sins O
. O

But O
how O
can O
I O
prove O
this O
to O
you O
? O

Maybe O
you O
are O
thinking O
it O
was O
easy O
for O
me O
to O
say O
to O
the O
crippled O
man O
, O
' O
Your O
sins O
are O
forgiven O
. O
' O

There O
's O
no O
proof O
it O
really O
happened O
. O

But O
what O
if O
I O
say O
to O
the O
man O
, O
' O
Stand O
up O
. O

Take O
your O
mat O
and O
walk O
' O
? O

Then O
you O
will O
be O
able O
to O
see O
if O
I O
really O
have O
this O
power O
or O
not O
. O
'' O

So O
Jesus O
said O
to O
the O
paralyzed O
man O
, O
`` O
I O
tell O
you O
, O
stand O
up O
. O

Take O
your O
mat O
and O
go O
home O
. O
'' O

Immediately O
the O
paralyzed O
man O
stood O
up O
. O

He O
picked O
up O
his O
mat O
and O
walked O
out O
of O
the O
room O
. O

Everyone O
could O
see O
him O
. O

They O
were O
amazed O
and O
praised O
God O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
This O
is O
the O
most O
amazing O
thing O
we O
have O
ever O
seen O
! O
'' O

Jesus O
went O
to O
the O
lake O
again O
, O
and O
many O
people O
followed O
him O
there O
. O

So O
Jesus O
taught O
them O
. O

He O
was O
walking O
beside O
the O
lake O
, O
and O
he O
saw O
a O
man O
named O
Levi O
, O
son O
of O
Alphaeus O
. O

Levi O
was O
sitting O
at O
his O
place O
for O
collecting O
taxes O
. O

Jesus O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Follow O
me O
. O
'' O

Then O
Levi O
stood O
up O
and O
followed O
Jesus O
. O

Later O
that O
day O
, O
Jesus O
and O
his O
followers O
ate O
at O
Levi O
's O
house O
. O

There O
were O
also O
many O
tax O
collectors O
and O
others O
with O
bad O
reputations O
eating O
with O
them O
. O

-LRB- O
There O
were O
many O
of O
these O
people O
who O
followed O
Jesus O
. O
-RRB- O

When O
some O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
who O
were O
Pharisees O
saw O
Jesus O
eating O
with O
such O
bad O
people O
, O
they O
asked O
his O
followers O
, O
`` O
Why O
does O
he O
eat O
with O
tax O
collectors O
and O
sinners O
? O
'' O

When O
Jesus O
heard O
this O
, O
he O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
It O
is O
the O
sick O
people O
who O
need O
a O
doctor O
, O
not O
those O
who O
are O
healthy O
. O

I O
did O
not O
come O
to O
invite O
good O
people O
. O

I O
came O
to O
invite O
sinners O
. O
'' O

The O
followers O
of O
John O
and O
the O
Pharisees O
were O
fasting O
. O

Some O
people O
came O
to O
Jesus O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
John O
's O
followers O
fast O
, O
and O
the O
followers O
of O
the O
Pharisees O
fast O
. O

But O
your O
followers O
do O
n't O
fast O
. O

Why O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
At O
a O
wedding O
the O
friends O
of O
the O
bridegroom O
are O
not O
sad O
while O
he O
is O
with O
them O

They O
can O
not O
fast O
while O
the O
bridegroom O
is O
still O
there O

But O
the O
time O
will O
come O
when O
the O
bridegroom O
will O
be O
taken O
from O
them O

Then O
they O
will O
fast O

`` O
When O
someone O
sews O
a O
patch O
over O
a O
hole O
in O
an O
old O
coat O
, O
they O
never O
use O
a O
piece O
of O
cloth O
that O
is O
not O
yet O
shrunk O

If O
they O
do O
, O
the O
patch O
will O
shrink O
and O
pull O
away O
from O
the O
coat O
. O

Then O
the O
hole O
will O
be O
worse O

Also O
, O
no O
one O
ever O
pours O
new O
wine O
into O
old O
wineskins O

The O
wine O
would O
break O
them O

and O
the O
wine O
would O
be O
ruined O
along O
with O
the O
wineskins O

You O
always O
put O
new O
wine O
into O
new O
wineskins O

'' O

On O
the O
Sabbath O
day O
, O
Jesus O
and O
his O
followers O
were O
walking O
through O
some O
grain O
fields O
. O

The O
followers O
picked O
some O
grain O
to O
eat O
. O

Some O
Pharisees O
said O
to O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
Why O
are O
your O
followers O
doing O
this O
? O

It O
is O
against O
the O
law O
to O
pick O
grain O
on O
the O
Sabbath O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
You O
have O
read O
what O
David O
did O
when O
he O
and O
the O
people O
with O
him O
were O

needed O
food O

It O
was O
during O
the O
time O
of O
Abiathar O
the O
high O
priest O

David O
went O
into O
God O

house O
and O
ate O
the O
bread O
that O
was O
offered O
to O
God O

And O
the O
Law O
of O
Moses O
says O
that O
only O
priests O
can O
eat O
that O
bread O

David O
also O
gave O
some O
of O
the O
bread O
to O

Jesus O

The O
leading O

trying O

a O
way O

arrest O

Bethany O

leper O

While O
he O
was O
eating O
there O

a O
woman O
came O
to O
him O

She O
had O
an O
alabaster O
jar O
filled O
with O
expensive O
perfume O
made O
of O
pure O
nard O

She O
opened O
the O
jar O

poured O
the O
perfume O
on O
Jesus O

head O

Some O
of O
the O
followers O
there O
saw O
this O

They O
were O
upset O

complained O
to O
each O
other O

said O
, O
`` O
Why O
waste O

It O
was O
worth O

the O
money O

And O
they O
told O
the O
woman O
what O
a O

had O
done O

you O

Then O
Judas O

one O
of O

went O
to O
talk O

You O
will O
see O
a O
man O
carrying O
a O
jar O
of O
water O
. O

He O
will O
come O
to O
you O
. O

Follow O
him O
. O

He O
will O
go O
into O
a O
house O
. O

Tell O
the O
owner O
of O
the O
house O
, O
' O
The O
Teacher O
asks O
that O
you O
show O
us O
the O
room O
where O
he O
and O
his O
followers O
can O
eat O
the O
Passover O
meal O
. O
' O

The O
owner O
will O
show O
you O
a O
large O
room O
upstairs O
that O
is O
ready O
for O
us O
. O

Prepare O
the O
meal O
for O
us O
there O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
followers O
left O
and O
went O
into O
the O
city O
. O

Everything O
happened O
the O
way O
Jesus O
said O
. O

So O
the O
followers O
prepared O
the O
Passover O
meal O
. O

In O
the O
evening O
, O
Jesus O
went O
to O
that O
house O
with O
the O
twelve O
apostles O
. O

While O
they O
were O
all O
at O
the O
table O
eating O
, O
he O
said O
, O
`` O

Believe O
me O
when O
I O
say O
that O
one O
of O
you O
will O
hand O
me O
over O
to O
my O
enemies O
-- O
one O
of O
you O
eating O
with O
me O
now O
. O
'' O

The O
followers O
were O
very O
sad O
to O
hear O
this O
. O

Each O
one O
said O
to O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
Surely O
I O
am O
not O
the O
one O
! O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
It O
is O
one O
of O
you O
twelve O
-- O
the O
one O
who O
is O
dipping O
his O
bread O
in O
the O
same O
bowl O
with O
me O
. O

The O
Son O
of O
Man O
will O
suffer O
what O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
will O
happen O
to O
him O
. O

But O
it O
will O
be O
very O
bad O
for O
the O
one O
who O
hands O
over O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O
to O
be O
killed O
. O

It O
would O
be O
better O
for O
him O
if O
he O
had O
never O
been O
born O
. O
'' O

While O
they O
were O
eating O
, O
Jesus O
took O
some O
bread O
and O
thanked O
God O
for O
it O
. O

He O
broke O
off O
some O
pieces O
, O
gave O
them O
to O
his O
followers O
and O
said O
, O
`` O

Take O
and O
eat O
this O
bread O
. O

It O
is O
my O
body O
. O
'' O

Then O
he O
took O
a O
cup O
of O
wine O
, O
thanked O
God O
for O
it O
, O
and O
gave O
it O
to O
them O
. O

They O
all O
drank O
from O
the O
cup O
. O

Then O
he O
said O
, O
`` O
This O
wine O
is O
my O
blood O
, O
which O
will O
be O
poured O
out O
for O
many O
to O
begin O
the O
new O
agreement O
from O
God O
to O
his O
people O
. O

I O
want O
you O
to O
know O
, O
I O
will O
not O
drink O
this O
wine O
again O
until O
that O
day O
when O
I O
drink O
it O
in O
God O
's O
kingdom O
and O
the O
wine O
is O
new O
. O
'' O

They O
all O
sang O
a O
song O
and O
then O
went O
out O
to O
the O
Mount O
of O
Olives O
. O

Then O
Jesus O
told O
the O
followers O
, O
`` O
You O
will O
all O
lose O
your O
faith O
. O

The O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
' O
I O
will O
kill O
the O
shepherd O
, O
and O
the O
sheep O
will O
run O
away O
. O
' O

But O
after O
I O
am O
killed O
, O
I O
will O
rise O
from O
death O
. O

Then O
I O
will O
go O
to O
Galilee O
. O

I O
will O
be O
there O
before O
you O
come O
. O
'' O

Peter O
said O
, O
`` O
All O
the O
other O
followers O
may O
lose O
their O
faith O
. O

But O
my O
faith O
will O
never O
be O
shaken O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
The O
truth O
is O
, O
tonight O
you O
will O
say O
you O
do O
n't O
know O
me O
. O

You O
will O
say O
it O
three O
times O
before O
the O
rooster O
crows O
twice O
. O
'' O

But O
Peter O
strongly O
protested O
, O
`` O
I O
will O
never O
say O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
you O
! O

I O
will O
even O
die O
with O
you O
! O
'' O

And O
all O
the O
other O
followers O
said O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

Jesus O
and O
his O
followers O
went O
to O
a O
place O
named O
Gethsemane O
. O

He O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Sit O
here O
while O
I O
pray O
. O
'' O

But O
he O
told O
Peter O
, O
James O
, O
and O
John O
to O
come O
with O
him O
. O

He O
began O
to O
be O
very O
distressed O
and O
troubled O
, O
and O
he O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
My O
heart O
is O
so O
heavy O
with O
grief O
, O
I O
feel O
as O
if O
I O
am O
dying O
. O

Wait O
here O
and O
stay O
awake O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
went O
on O
a O
little O
farther O
away O
from O
them O
, O
fell O
to O
the O
ground O
, O
and O
prayed O
. O

He O
asked O
that O
, O
if O
possible O
, O
he O
would O
not O
have O
this O
time O
of O
suffering O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Abba O
, O
Father O
! O

You O
can O
do O
all O
things O
. O

Do O
n't O
make O
me O
drink O
from O
this O
cup O
. O

But O
do O
what O
you O
want O
, O
not O
what O
I O
want O
. O
'' O

Then O
he O
went O
back O
to O
his O
followers O
and O
found O
them O
sleeping O
. O

He O
said O
to O
Peter O
, O
`` O
Simon O
, O
why O
are O
you O
sleeping O
? O

Could O
you O
not O
stay O
awake O
with O
me O
for O
one O
hour O
? O

Stay O
awake O
and O
pray O
for O
strength O
against O
temptation O
. O

Your O
spirit O
wants O
to O
do O
what O
is O
right O
, O
but O
your O
body O
is O
weak O
. O
'' O

Again O
Jesus O
went O
away O
and O
prayed O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

Then O
he O
went O
back O
to O
the O
followers O
and O
again O
found O
them O
sleeping O
. O

They O
could O
not O
stay O
awake O
. O

They O
did O
not O
know O
what O
they O
should O
say O
to O
him O
. O

After O
Jesus O
prayed O
a O
third O
time O
, O
he O
went O
back O
to O
his O
followers O
. O

He O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Are O
you O
still O
sleeping O
and O
resting O
? O

That O
's O
enough O
! O

The O
time O
has O
come O
for O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O
to O
be O
handed O
over O
to O
the O
control O
of O
sinful O
men O
. O

Stand O
up O
! O

We O
must O
go O
. O

Here O
comes O
the O
man O
who O
is O
handing O
me O
over O
to O
them O
. O
'' O

While O
Jesus O
was O
still O
speaking O
, O
Judas O
, O
one O
of O
the O
twelve O
apostles O
, O
came O
there O
. O

He O
had O
a O
big O
crowd O
of O
people O
with O
him O
, O
all O
carrying O
swords O
and O
clubs O
. O

They O
had O
been O
sent O
from O
the O
leading O
priests O
, O
the O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
, O
and O
the O
older O
Jewish O
leaders O
. O

Judas O
planned O
to O
do O
something O
to O
show O
them O
which O
one O
was O
Jesus O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
one O
I O
kiss O
will O
be O
Jesus O
. O

Arrest O
him O
and O
guard O
him O
while O
you O
lead O
him O
away O
. O
'' O

So O
Judas O
went O
over O
to O
Jesus O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Teacher O
! O
'' O

Then O
he O
kissed O
him O
. O

The O
men O
grabbed O
Jesus O
and O
arrested O
him O
. O

One O
of O
the O
followers O
standing O
near O
Jesus O
grabbed O
his O
sword O
and O
pulled O
it O
out O
. O

He O
swung O
it O
at O
the O
servant O
of O
the O
high O
priest O
and O
cut O
off O
his O
ear O
. O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Why O
do O
you O
come O
to O
get O
me O
with O
swords O
and O
clubs O
as O
if O
I O
were O
a O
criminal O
? O

Every O
day O
I O
was O
with O
you O
teaching O
in O
the O
Temple O
area O
. O

You O
did O
not O
arrest O
me O
there O
. O

But O
all O
these O
things O
have O
happened O
to O
show O
the O
full O
meaning O
of O
what O
the O
Scriptures O
said O
. O
'' O
Then O
all O
of O
Jesus O
' O
followers O
left O
him O
and O
ran O
away O
. O

One O
of O
those O
following O
Jesus O
was O
a O
young O
man O
wearing O
only O
a O
linen O
cloth O
. O

When O
the O
people O
tried O
to O
grab O
him O
, O
he O
left O
the O
cloth O
in O
their O
hands O
and O
ran O
away O
naked O
. O

Those O
who O
arrested O
Jesus O
led O
him O
to O
the O
house O
of O
the O
high O
priest O
. O

All O
the O
leading O
priests O
, O
the O
older O
Jewish O
leaders O
, O
and O
the O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
were O
gathered O
there O
. O

Peter O
followed O
Jesus O
but O
stayed O
back O
at O
a O
distance O
. O

He O
followed O
him O
to O
the O
yard O
of O
the O
high O
priest O
's O
house O
. O

He O
went O
into O
the O
yard O
and O
sat O
there O
with O
the O
guards O
, O
warming O
himself O
by O
their O
fire O
. O

The O
leading O
priests O
and O
the O
whole O
high O
council O
tried O
to O
find O
something O
that O
Jesus O
had O
done O
wrong O
so O
they O
could O
kill O
him O
. O

But O
the O
council O
could O
find O
no O
proof O
that O
would O
allow O
them O
to O
kill O
Jesus O
. O

Many O
people O
came O
and O
told O
lies O
against O
Jesus O
, O
but O
they O
all O
said O
different O
things O
. O

None O
of O
them O
agreed O
. O

Then O
some O
others O
stood O
up O
and O
told O
more O
lies O
against O
Jesus O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
We O
heard O
this O
man O
say O
, O
' O
I O
will O
destroy O
this O
Temple O
built O
by O
human O
hands O
. O

And O
three O
days O
later O
, O
I O
will O
build O
another O
Temple O
not O
made O
by O
human O
hands O
. O
' O
'' O

But O
also O
what O
these O
people O
said O
did O
not O
agree O
. O

Then O
the O
high O
priest O
stood O
up O
before O
everyone O
and O
said O
to O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
These O
people O
said O
things O
against O
you O
. O

Do O
you O
have O
something O
to O
say O
about O
their O
charges O
? O

Are O
they O
telling O
the O
truth O
? O
'' O

But O
Jesus O
said O
nothing O
to O
answer O
him O
. O

The O
high O
priest O
asked O
Jesus O
another O
question O
: O
`` O
Are O
you O
the O
Christ O
, O
the O
Son O
of O
the O
blessed O
God O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
I O
am O
the O
Son O
of O
God O
. O

And O
in O
the O
future O
you O
will O
see O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O
sitting O
at O
the O
right O
side O
of O
God O
All O
- O
Powerful O
. O

And O
you O
will O
see O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O
coming O
on O
the O
clouds O
of O
heaven O
. O
'' O

When O
the O
high O
priest O
heard O
this O
, O
he O
tore O
his O
clothes O
in O
anger O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
We O
do O
n't O
need O
any O
more O
witnesses O
! O

You O
all O
heard O
these O
insults O
to O
God O
. O

What O
do O
you O
think O
? O
'' O

Everyone O
agreed O
that O
Jesus O
was O
guilty O
and O
must O
be O
killed O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
people O
there O
spit O
at O
him O
. O

They O
covered O
his O
eyes O
and O
hit O
him O
with O
their O
fists O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Be O
a O
prophet O
and O
tell O
us O
who O
hit O
you O
! O
'' O

Then O
the O
guards O
led O
Jesus O
away O
and O
beat O
him O
. O

While O
Peter O
was O
still O
in O
the O
yard O
, O
a O
servant O
girl O
of O
the O
high O
priest O
came O
there O
. O

She O
saw O
him O
warming O
himself O
by O
the O
fire O
. O

She O
looked O
closely O
at O
him O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
were O
with O
Jesus O
, O
that O
man O
from O
Nazareth O
. O
'' O

But O
Peter O
said O
this O
was O
not O
true O
. O

`` O
That O
makes O
no O
sense O
, O
'' O
he O
said O
. O

`` O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
you O
are O
talking O
about O
! O
'' O

Then O
he O
left O
and O
went O
to O
the O
entrance O
of O
the O
yard O
, O
and O
a O
rooster O
crowed O
. O

When O
the O
servant O
girl O
saw O
him O
there O
, O
she O
began O
saying O
again O
to O
the O
people O
standing O
around O
, O
`` O
This O
man O
is O
one O
of O
them O
. O
'' O

Again O
Peter O
said O
it O
was O
not O
true O
. O

A O
short O
time O
later O
, O
the O
people O
standing O
there O
said O
, O
`` O
We O
know O
you O
are O
one O
of O
them O
, O
because O
you O
are O
from O
Galilee O
. O
'' O

Then O
Peter O
began O
to O
curse O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
swear O
to O
God O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
this O
man O
you O
are O
talking O
about O
! O
'' O

As O
soon O
as O
Peter O
said O
this O
, O
the O
rooster O
crowed O
the O
second O
time O
. O

Then O
he O
remembered O
what O
Jesus O
had O
told O
him O
: O
`` O
Before O
the O
rooster O
crows O
twice O
, O
you O
will O
say O
three O
times O
that O
you O
do O
n't O
know O
me O
. O
'' O

Then O
Peter O
began O
to O
cry O
. O

The O
Good O
News O
about O
Jesus O
Christ O
, O
the O
Son O
of O
God O
, O
begins O
with O
what O
the O
prophet O
Isaiah O
said O
would O
happen O
. O

He O
wrote O
: O
`` O
Listen O
! O

I O
will O
send O
my O
messenger O
ahead O
of O
you O
. O

He O
will O
prepare O
the O
way O
for O
you O
. O
'' O

`` O
There O
is O
someone O
shouting O
in O
the O
desert O
: O
' O
Prepare O
the O
way O
for O
the O
Lord O
. O

Make O
the O
road O
straight O
for O
him O
. O
' O
'' O

So O
John O
the O
Baptizer O
came O
and O
was O
baptizing O
people O
in O
the O
desert O
area O
. O

He O
told O
them O
to O
be O
baptized O
to O
show O
that O
they O
wanted O
to O
change O
their O
lives O
, O
and O
then O
their O
sins O
would O
be O
forgiven O
. O

All O
the O
people O
from O
Judea O
, O
including O
everyone O
from O
Jerusalem O
, O
came O
out O
to O
John O
. O

They O
confessed O
the O
bad O
things O
they O
had O
done O
, O
and O
he O
baptized O
them O
in O
the O
Jordan O
River O
. O

John O
wore O
clothes O
made O
from O
camel O
's O
hair O
and O
a O
leather O
belt O
around O
his O
waist O
. O

He O
ate O
locusts O
and O
wild O
honey O
. O

This O
is O
what O
John O
told O
the O
people O
: O
`` O
There O
is O
someone O
coming O
later O
who O
is O
able O
to O
do O
more O
than O
I O
can O
. O

I O
am O
not O
good O
enough O
to O
be O
the O
slave O
who O
stoops O
down O
to O
untie O
his O
sandals O
. O

I O
baptize O
you O
with O
water O
, O
but O
the O
one O
who O
is O
coming O
will O
baptize O
you O
with O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
. O
'' O

About O
that O
time O
Jesus O
came O
from O
the O
town O
of O
Nazareth O
in O
Galilee O
to O
the O
place O
where O
John O
was O
. O

John O
baptized O
Jesus O
in O
the O
Jordan O
River O
. O

As O
Jesus O
was O
coming O
up O
out O
of O
the O
water O
, O
he O
saw O
the O
sky O
torn O
open O
. O

The O
Spirit O
came O
down O
on O
him O
like O
a O
dove O
. O

A O
voice O
came O
from O
heaven O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
are O
my O
Son O
, O
the O
one O
I O
love O
. O

I O
am O
very O
pleased O
with O
you O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
Spirit O
sent O
Jesus O
into O
the O
desert O
alone O
. O

He O
was O
there O
for O
40 O
days O
, O
being O
tempted O
by O
Satan O
. O

During O
this O
time O
he O
was O
out O
among O
the O
wild O
animals O
. O

Then O
angels O
came O
and O
helped O
him O
. O

After O
John O
was O
put O
in O
prison O
, O
Jesus O
went O
into O
Galilee O
and O
told O
people O
the O
Good O
News O
from O
God O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
right O
time O
is O
now O
here O
. O

God O
's O
kingdom O
is O
near O
. O

Change O
your O
hearts O
and O
lives O
, O
and O
believe O
the O
Good O
News O
! O
'' O

Jesus O
was O
walking O
by O
Lake O
Galilee O
. O

He O
saw O
Simon O
and O
his O
brother O
, O
Andrew O
. O

These O
two O
men O
were O
fishermen O
, O
and O
they O
were O
throwing O
a O
net O
into O
the O
lake O
to O
catch O
fish O
. O

Jesus O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Come O
, O
follow O
me O
, O
and O
I O
will O
make O
you O
a O
different O
kind O
of O
fishermen O
. O

You O
will O
bring O
in O
people O
, O
not O
fish O
. O
'' O

So O
they O
immediately O
left O
their O
nets O
and O
followed O
Jesus O
. O

Jesus O
continued O
walking O
by O
Lake O
Galilee O
. O

He O
saw O
two O
more O
brothers O
, O
James O
and O
John O
, O
the O
sons O
of O
Zebedee O
. O

They O
were O
in O
their O
boat O
, O
preparing O
their O
nets O
to O
catch O
fish O
. O

Their O
father O
Zebedee O
and O
the O
men O
who O
worked O
for O
him O
were O
in O
the O
boat O
with O
the O
brothers O
. O

When O
Jesus O
saw O
the O
brothers O
, O
he O
told O
them O
to O
come O
. O

They O
left O
their O
father O
and O
followed O
Jesus O
. O

Jesus O
and O
his O
followers O
went O
to O
Capernaum O
. O

On O
the O
Sabbath O
day O
, O
Jesus O
went O
into O
the O
synagogue O
and O
taught O
the O
people O
. O

They O
were O
amazed O
at O
his O
teaching O
. O

He O
did O
not O
teach O
like O
their O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
. O

He O
taught O
like O
someone O
with O
authority O
. O

While O
Jesus O
was O
in O
the O
synagogue O
, O
a O
man O
was O
there O
who O
had O
an O
evil O
spirit O
inside O
him O
. O

The O
man O
shouted O
, O
`` O
Jesus O
of O
Nazareth O
! O

What O
do O
you O
want O
with O
us O
? O

Did O
you O
come O
to O
destroy O
us O
? O

I O
know O
who O
you O
are O
-- O
God O
's O
Holy O
One O
! O
'' O

Jesus O
, O
his O
voice O
full O
of O
warning O
, O
said O
, O
`` O
Be O
quiet O
, O
and O
come O
out O
of O
him O
! O
'' O

The O
evil O
spirit O
made O
the O
man O
shake O
. O

Then O
the O
spirit O
made O
a O
loud O
noise O
and O
came O
out O
of O
him O
. O

The O
people O
were O
amazed O
. O

They O
asked O
each O
other O
, O
`` O
What O
is O
happening O
here O
? O

This O
man O
is O
teaching O
something O
new O
, O
and O
he O
teaches O
with O
authority O
! O

He O
even O
commands O
evil O
spirits O
, O
and O
they O
obey O
him O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
news O
about O
Jesus O
spread O
quickly O
everywhere O
in O
the O
area O
of O
Galilee O
. O

Jesus O
and O
the O
followers O
left O
the O
synagogue O
. O

They O
all O
went O
with O
James O
and O
John O
to O
the O
home O
of O
Simon O
and O
Andrew O
. O

Simon O
's O
mother O
- O
in O
- O
law O
was O
very O
sick O
. O

She O
was O
in O
bed O
and O
had O
a O
fever O
. O

The O
people O
there O
told O
Jesus O
about O
her O
. O

So O
he O
went O
to O
her O
bed O
. O

Jesus O
held O
her O
hand O
and O
helped O
her O
stand O
up O
. O

The O
fever O
left O
her O
, O
and O
she O
was O
healed O
. O

Then O
she O
began O
serving O
them O
. O

That O
night O
, O
after O
the O
sun O
went O
down O
, O
the O
people O
brought O
to O
Jesus O
many O
who O
were O
sick O
. O

They O
also O
brought O
those O
who O
had O
demons O
inside O
them O
. O

Everyone O
in O
the O
town O
gathered O
at O
the O
door O
of O
that O
house O
. O

Jesus O
healed O
many O
of O
those O
who O
had O
different O
kinds O
of O
sicknesses O
. O

He O
also O
forced O
many O
demons O
out O
of O
people O
. O

But O
he O
would O
not O
allow O
the O
demons O
to O
speak O
, O
because O
they O
knew O
who O
he O
was O
. O

The O
next O
morning O
Jesus O
woke O
up O
very O
early O
. O

He O
left O
the O
house O
while O
it O
was O
still O
dark O
and O
went O
to O
a O
place O
where O
he O
could O
be O
alone O
and O
pray O
. O

Later O
, O
Simon O
and O
his O
friends O
went O
to O
look O
for O
Jesus O
. O

They O
found O
him O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Everyone O
is O
looking O
for O
you O
! O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
We O
should O
go O
to O
another O
place O
. O

We O
can O
go O
to O
other O
towns O
around O
here O
, O
and O
I O
can O
tell O
God O
's O
message O
to O
those O
people O
too O
. O

That O
is O
why O
I O
came O
. O
'' O

So O
Jesus O
traveled O
everywhere O
in O
Galilee O
. O

He O
spoke O
in O
the O
synagogues O
, O
and O
he O
forced O
demons O
out O
of O
people O
. O

A O
man O
who O
had O
leprosy O
came O
to O
Jesus O
. O

The O
man O
bowed O
on O
his O
knees O
and O
begged O
him O
, O
`` O
You O
have O
the O
power O
to O
heal O
me O
if O
you O
want O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
felt O
sorry O
for O
the O
man O
. O

So O
he O
touched O
him O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
want O
to O
heal O
you O
. O

Be O
healed O
! O
'' O

Immediately O
the O
leprosy O
disappeared O
, O
and O
the O
man O
was O
healed O
. O

Jesus O
told O
the O
man O
to O
go O
, O
but O
he O
gave O
him O
a O
strong O
warning O
: O
`` O
Do O
n't O
tell O
anyone O
about O
what O
I O
did O
for O
you O
. O

But O
go O
and O
let O
the O
priest O
look O
at O
you O
. O

And O
offer O
a O
gift O
to O
God O
because O
you O
have O
been O
healed O
. O

Offer O
the O
gift O
that O
Moses O
commanded O
. O

This O
will O
show O
everyone O
that O
you O
are O
healed O
. O
'' O

The O
man O
left O
there O
and O
told O
everyone O
he O
saw O
that O
Jesus O
had O
healed O
him O
. O

So O
the O
news O
about O
Jesus O
spread O
. O

And O
that O
is O
why O
he O
could O
not O
enter O
a O
town O
if O
people O
saw O
him O
. O

He O
stayed O
in O
places O
where O
people O
did O
not O
live O
. O

But O
people O
came O
from O
all O
the O
towns O
to O
the O
places O
where O
he O
was O
. O

Some O
Pharisees O
and O
some O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
came O
from O
Jerusalem O
and O
gathered O
around O
Jesus O
. O

They O
saw O
that O
some O
of O
his O
followers O
ate O
food O
with O
hands O
that O
were O
not O
clean O
, O
meaning O
that O
they O
did O
not O
wash O
their O
hands O
in O
a O
special O
way O
. O

The O
Pharisees O
and O
all O
the O
other O
Jews O
never O
eat O
before O
washing O
their O
hands O
in O
this O
special O
way O
. O

They O
do O
this O
to O
follow O
the O
traditions O
they O
have O
from O
their O
great O
leaders O
who O
lived O
long O
ago O
. O

And O
when O
these O
Jews O
buy O
something O
in O
the O
market O
, O
they O
never O
eat O
it O
until O
they O
wash O
it O
in O
a O
special O
way O
. O

They O
also O
follow O
other O
rules O
from O
their O
people O
who O
lived O
before O
them O
. O

They O
follow O
rules O
like O
the O
washing O
of O
cups O
, O
pitchers O
, O
and O
pots O
. O

The O
Pharisees O
and O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
said O
to O
Jesus O
, O
`` O

Your O
followers O
do O
n't O
follow O
the O
traditions O
we O
have O
from O
our O
great O
leaders O
who O
lived O
long O
ago O
. O

They O
eat O
their O
food O
with O
hands O
that O
are O
not O
clean O
. O

Why O
do O
they O
do O
this O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
You O
are O
all O
hypocrites O
. O

Isaiah O
was O
right O
when O
he O
wrote O
these O
words O
from O
God O
about O
you O
: O
' O
These O
people O
honor O
me O
with O
their O
words O
, O
but O
I O
am O
not O
really O
important O
to O
them O
. O

Their O
worship O
of O
me O
is O
worthless O
. O

The O
things O
they O
teach O
are O
only O
human O
rules O
. O
' O

You O
have O
stopped O
following O
God O
's O
commands O
, O
preferring O
instead O
the O
man O
- O
made O
rules O
you O
got O
from O
others O
. O
'' O

Then O
he O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
show O
great O
skill O
in O
avoiding O
the O
commands O
of O
God O
so O
that O
you O
can O
follow O
your O
own O
teachings O
! O

Moses O
said O
, O
' O
You O
must O
respect O
your O
father O
and O
mother O
. O
' O

He O
also O
said O
, O
' O
Whoever O
says O
anything O
bad O
to O
their O
father O
or O
mother O
must O
be O
killed O
. O
' O

But O
you O
teach O
that O
people O
can O
say O
to O
their O
father O
or O
mother O
, O
' O
I O
have O
something O
I O
could O
use O
to O
help O
you O
, O
but O
I O
will O
not O
use O
it O
for O
you O
. O

I O
will O
give O
it O
to O
God O

' O

You O
are O
telling O
people O
that O
they O
do O
not O
have O
to O
do O
anything O
for O
their O
father O
or O
mother O
. O

So O
you O
are O
teaching O
that O
it O
is O
not O
important O
to O
do O
what O
God O
said O
. O

You O
think O
it O
is O
more O
important O
to O
follow O
those O
traditions O
you O
have O
, O
which O
you O
pass O
on O
to O
others O
. O

And O
you O
do O
many O
things O
like O
that O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
called O
the O
people O
to O
him O
again O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Everyone O
should O
listen O
to O
me O
and O
understand O
what O
I O
am O
saying O

There O
is O
nothing O
people O
can O
put O
in O
their O
mouth O
that O
will O
make O
them O
wrong O

People O
are O
made O
wrong O
by O
what O
comes O
from O
inside O
them O

'' O

Then O
Jesus O
left O
the O
people O
and O
went O
into O
the O
house O
. O

The O
followers O
asked O
Jesus O
about O
what O
he O
had O
told O
the O
people O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Do O
you O
still O
have O
trouble O
understanding O
? O

Surely O
you O
know O
that O
nothing O
that O
enters O

the O
outside O

make O

not O

It O
goes O
into O
the O

Then O
it O
goes O
out O

When O
Jesus O
said O

meant O
there O
is O
no O

is O
wrong O

And O
Jesus O
said O

`` O
The O

Jesus O
went O
from O
there O
to O
the O
area O
around O
Tyre O

He O
did O
not O
want O
the O
people O
in O
that O
area O
to O
know O
he O
was O
there O
, O
so O
he O
went O
into O
a O
house O

But O
he O
could O
not O
stay O
hidden O

A O
woman O
heard O
that O
he O
was O
there O
. O

Her O
little O
daughter O
had O
an O
evil O
spirit O
inside O
her O

So O
the O
woman O
came O
to O
Jesus O
and O
bowed O
down O
near O
his O
feet O

She O
was O
not O
a O
Jew O

She O
was O
born O
in O
Phoenicia O

an O
area O
in O
Syria O

She O
begged O
Jesus O
to O
force O
the O
demon O
out O
of O
her O
daughter O

Jesus O
told O
the O
woman O
, O
`` O
It O

`` O

Then O
he O
told O

The O

went O
home O
and O
found O
her O
daughter O
lying O
on O
the O
bed O

The O
demon O
was O
gone O

Jesus O
left O
the O
area O
around O
Tyre O

went O
through O
Sidon O

On O
his O
way O
to O
Lake O
Galilee O
he O
went O
through O
the O
area O
of O
the O
Ten O

While O
he O
was O
there O

some O
people O
brought O
a O
man O

him O

was O
deaf O

The O

Jesus O
looked O
up O

new O
voice O
to O
people O
who O
could O
not O
talk O
. O
'' O

My O
dear O
friends O
, O
many O
false O
prophets O
are O
in O
the O
world O
now O
. O

So O
do O
n't O
believe O
every O
spirit O
, O
but O
test O
the O
spirits O
to O
see O
if O
they O
are O
from O
God O
. O

This O
is O
how O
you O
can O
recognize O
God O
's O
Spirit O
. O

One O
spirit O
says O
, O
`` O
I O
believe O
that O
Jesus O
is O
the O
Christ O
who O
came O
to O
earth O
and O
became O
a O
man O
. O
'' O

That O
Spirit O
is O
from O
God O
. O

Another O
spirit O
refuses O
to O
say O
this O
about O
Jesus O
. O

That O
spirit O
is O
not O
from O
God O
. O

This O
is O
the O
spirit O
of O
the O
enemy O
of O
Christ O
. O

You O
have O
heard O
that O
the O
enemy O
of O
Christ O
is O
coming O
, O
and O
now O
he O
is O
already O
in O
the O
world O
. O

My O
dear O
children O
, O
you O
belong O
to O
God O
, O
so O
you O
have O
already O
defeated O
these O
false O
prophets O
. O

That O
's O
because O
the O
one O
who O
is O
in O
you O
is O
greater O
than O
the O
one O
who O
is O
in O
the O
world O
. O

And O
they O
belong O
to O
the O
world O
, O
so O
what O
they O
say O
is O
from O
the O
world O
too O
. O

And O
the O
world O
listens O
to O
what O
they O
say O
. O

But O
we O
are O
from O
God O
. O

So O
the O
people O
who O
know O
God O
listen O
to O
us O
. O

But O
the O
people O
who O
are O
not O
from O
God O
do O
n't O
listen O
to O
us O
. O

That O
is O
how O
we O
know O
the O
Spirit O
that O
is O
true O
and O
the O
spirit O
that O
is O
false O
. O

Dear O
friends O
, O
we O
should O
love O
each O
other O
, O
because O
love O
comes O
from O
God O
. O

Everyone O
who O
loves O
has O
become O
God O
's O
child O
. O

And O
so O
everyone O
who O
loves O
knows O
God O
. O

Anyone O
who O
does O
not O
love O
does O
not O
know O
God O
, O
because O
God O
is O
love O
. O

This O
is O
how O
God O
showed O
his O
love O
to O
us O
: O
He O
sent O
his O
only O
Son O
into O
the O
world O
to O
give O
us O
life O
through O
him O
. O

True O
love O
is O
God O
's O
love O
for O
us O
, O
not O
our O
love O
for O
God O
. O

He O
sent O
his O
Son O
as O
the O
way O
to O
take O
away O
our O
sins O
. O

That O
is O
how O
much O
God O
loved O
us O
, O
dear O
friends O
! O

So O
we O
also O
must O
love O
each O
other O
. O

No O
one O
has O
ever O
seen O
God O
. O

But O
if O
we O
love O
each O
other O
, O
God O
lives O
in O
us O
. O

If O
we O
love O
each O
other O
, O
God O
's O
love O
has O
reached O
its O
goal O
-- O
it O
is O
made O
perfect O
in O
us O
. O

We O
know O
that O
we O
live O
in O
God O
and O
God O
lives O
in O
us O
. O

We O
know O
this O
because O
he O
gave O
us O
his O
Spirit O
. O

We O
have O
seen O
that O
the O
Father O
sent O
his O
Son O
to O
be O
the O
Savior O
of O
the O
world O
, O
and O
this O
is O
what O
we O
tell O
people O
now O
. O

Anyone O
who O
says O
, O
`` O
I O
believe O
that O
Jesus O
is O
the O
Son O
of O
God O
, O
'' O
is O
a O
person O
who O
lives O
in O
God O
, O
and O
God O
lives O
in O
that O
person O
. O

So O
we O
know O
the O
love O
that O
God O
has O
for O
us O
, O
and O
we O
trust O
that O
love O
. O

God O
is O
love O
. O

Everyone O
who O
lives O
in O
love O
lives O
in O
God O
, O
and O
God O
lives O
in O
them O
. O

If O
God O
's O
love O
is O
made O
perfect O
in O
us O
, O
we O
can O
be O
without O
fear O
on O
the O
day O
when O
God O
judges O
the O
world O
. O

We O
will O
be O
without O
fear O
, O
because O
in O
this O
world O
we O
are O
like O
Jesus O
. O

Where O
God O
's O
love O
is O
, O
there O
is O
no O
fear O
, O
because O
God O
's O
perfect O
love O
takes O
away O
fear O
. O

It O
is O
his O
punishment O
that O
makes O
a O
person O
fear O
. O

So O
his O
love O
is O
not O
made O
perfect O
in O
the O
one O
who O
has O
fear O
. O

We O
love O
because O
God O
first O
loved O
us O
. O

If O
we O
say O
we O
love O
God O
but O
hate O
any O
of O
our O
brothers O
or O
sisters O
in O
his O
family O
, O
we O
are O
liars O
. O

If O
we O
do O
n't O
love O
someone O
we O
have O
seen O
, O
how O
can O
we O
love O
God O
? O

We O
have O
never O
even O
seen O
him O
. O

God O
gave O
us O
this O
command O
: O
If O
we O
love O
God O
, O
we O
must O
also O
love O
each O
other O
as O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
. O

We O
want O
to O
tell O
you O
about O
the O
Word O
that O
gives O
life O
-- O
the O
one O
who O
existed O
before O
the O
world O
began O
. O

This O
is O
the O
one O
we O
have O
heard O
and O
have O
seen O
with O
our O
own O
eyes O
. O

We O
saw O
what O
he O
did O
, O
and O
our O
hands O
touched O
him O
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
one O
who O
is O
life O
was O
shown O
to O
us O
. O

We O
saw O
him O
, O
and O
so O
we O
can O
tell O
others O
about O
him O
. O

We O
now O
tell O
you O
about O
him O
. O

He O
is O
the O
eternal O
life O
that O
was O
with O
God O
the O
Father O
and O
was O
shown O
to O
us O
. O

We O
are O
telling O
you O
about O
what O
we O
have O
seen O
and O
heard O
because O
we O
want O
you O
to O
have O
fellowship O
with O
us O
. O

The O
fellowship O
we O
share O
together O
is O
with O
God O
the O
Father O
and O
his O
Son O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

We O
write O
these O
things O
to O
you O
so O
that O
you O
can O
be O
full O
of O
joy O
with O
us O
. O

We O
heard O
the O
true O
teaching O
from O
God O
. O

Now O
we O
tell O
it O
to O
you O
: O
God O
is O
light O
, O
and O
in O
him O
there O
is O
no O
darkness O
. O

So O
if O
we O
say O
that O
we O
share O
in O
life O
with O
God O
, O
but O
we O
continue O
living O
in O
darkness O
, O
we O
are O
liars O
, O
who O
do O
n't O
follow O
the O
truth O
. O

We O
should O
live O
in O
the O
light O
, O
where O
God O
is O
. O

If O
we O
live O
in O
the O
light O
, O
we O
have O
fellowship O
with O
each O
other O
, O
and O
the O
blood O
sacrifice O
of O
Jesus O
, O
God O
's O
Son O
, O
washes O
away O
every O
sin O
and O
makes O
us O
clean O
. O

If O
we O
say O
that O
we O
have O
no O
sin O
, O
we O
are O
fooling O
ourselves O
, O
and O
the O
truth O
is O
not O
in O
us O
. O

But O
if O
we O
confess O
our O
sins O
, O
God O
will O
forgive O
us O
. O

We O
can O
trust O
God O
to O
do O
this O
. O

He O
always O
does O
what O
is O
right O
. O

He O
will O
make O
us O
clean O
from O
all O
the O
wrong O
things O
we O
have O
done O
. O

If O
we O
say O
that O
we O
have O
not O
sinned O
, O
we O
are O
saying O
that O
God O
is O
a O
liar O
and O
that O
we O
do O
n't O
accept O
his O
true O
teaching O
. O

My O
dear O
children O
, O
I O
write O
this O
letter O
to O
you O
so O
that O
you O
will O
not O
sin O
. O

But O
if O
anyone O
sins O
, O
we O
have O
Jesus O
Christ O
to O
help O
us O
. O

He O
always O
did O
what O
was O
right O
, O
so O
he O
is O
able O
to O
defend O
us O
before O
God O
the O
Father O
. O

Jesus O
is O
the O
way O
our O
sins O
are O
taken O
away O
. O

And O
he O
is O
the O
way O
all O
people O
can O
have O
their O
sins O
taken O
away O
too O
. O

If O
we O
obey O
what O
God O
has O
told O
us O
to O
do O
, O
then O
we O
are O
sure O
that O
we O
know O
him O
. O

If O
we O
say O
we O
know O
God O
but O
do O
not O
obey O
his O
commands O
, O
we O
are O
lying O
. O

The O
truth O
is O
not O
in O
us O
. O

But O
when O
we O
obey O
God O
's O
teaching O
, O
his O
love O
is O
truly O
working O
in O
us O
. O

This O
is O
how O
we O
know O
that O
we O
are O
living O
in O
him O
. O

If O
we O
say O
we O
live O
in O
God O
, O
we O
must O
live O
the O
way O
Jesus O
lived O
. O

My O
dear O
friends O
, O
I O
am O
not O
writing O
a O
new O
command O
to O
you O
. O

It O
is O
the O
same O
command O
you O
have O
had O
since O
the O
beginning O
. O

This O
command O
is O
the O
teaching O
you O
have O
already O
heard O
. O

But O
what O
I O
write O
is O
also O
a O
new O
command O
. O

It O
is O
a O
true O
one O
; O
you O
can O
see O
its O
truth O
in O
Jesus O
and O
in O
yourselves O
. O

The O
darkness O
is O
passing O
away O
, O
and O
the O
true O
light O
is O
already O
shining O
. O

Someone O
might O
say O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
in O
the O
light O
, O
'' O
but O
if O
they O
hate O
any O
of O
their O
brothers O
or O
sisters O
in O
God O
's O
family O
, O
they O
are O
still O
in O
the O
darkness O
. O

Those O
who O
love O
their O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
live O
in O
the O
light O
, O
and O
there O
is O
nothing O
in O
them O
that O
will O
make O
them O
do O
wrong O
. O

But O
whoever O
hates O
their O
brother O
or O
sister O
is O
in O
darkness O
. O

They O
live O
in O
darkness O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
know O
where O
they O
are O
going O
, O
because O
the O
darkness O
has O
made O
them O
blind O
. O

I O
write O
to O
you O
, O
dear O
children O
, O
because O
your O
sins O
are O
forgiven O
through O
Christ O
. O

I O
write O
to O
you O
, O
fathers O
, O
because O
you O
know O
the O
one O
who O
existed O
from O
the O
beginning O
. O

I O
write O
to O
you O
, O
young O
people O
, O
because O
you O
have O
defeated O
the O
Evil O
One O
. O

I O
write O
to O
you O
, O
children O
, O
because O
you O
know O
the O
Father O
. O

I O
write O
to O
you O
, O
fathers O
, O
because O
you O
know O
the O
one O
who O
existed O
from O
the O
beginning O
. O

I O
write O
to O
you O
, O
young O
people O
, O
because O
you O
are O
strong O
. O

The O
word O
of O
God O
lives O
in O
you O
, O
and O
you O
have O
defeated O
the O
Evil O
One O
. O

Do O
n't O
love O
this O
evil O
world O
or O
the O
things O
in O
it O
. O

If O
you O
love O
the O
world O
, O
you O
do O
not O
have O
the O
love O
of O
the O
Father O
in O
you O
. O

This O
is O
all O
there O
is O
in O
the O
world O
: O
wanting O
to O
please O
our O
sinful O
selves O
, O
wanting O
the O
sinful O
things O
we O
see O
, O
and O
being O
too O
proud O
of O
what O
we O
have O
. O

But O
none O
of O
these O
comes O
from O
the O
Father O
. O

They O
come O
from O
the O
world O
. O

The O
world O
is O
passing O
away O
, O
and O
all O
the O
things O
that O
people O
want O
in O
the O
world O
are O
passing O
away O
. O

But O
whoever O
does O
what O
God O
wants O
will O
live O
forever O
. O

My O
dear O
children O
, O
the O
end O
is O
near O
! O

You O
have O
heard O
that O
the O
enemy O
of O
Christ O
is O
coming O
. O

And O
now O
many O
enemies O
of O
Christ O
are O
already O
here O
. O

So O
we O
know O
that O
the O
end O
is O
near O
. O

These O
enemies O
were O
in O
our O
group O
, O
but O
they O
left O
us O
. O

They O
did O
not O
really O
belong O
with O
us O
. O

If O
they O
were O
really O
part O
of O
our O
group O
, O
they O
would O
have O
stayed O
with O
us O
. O

But O
they O
left O
. O

This O
shows O
that O
none O
of O
them O
really O
belonged O
with O
us O
. O

You O
have O
the O
gift O
that O
the O
Holy O
One O
gave O
you O
. O

So O
you O
all O
know O
the O
truth O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
I O
am O
writing O
this O
letter O
because O
you O
do O
n't O
know O
the O
truth O
? O

No O
, O
I O
am O
writing O
because O
you O
do O
know O
the O
truth O
. O

And O
you O
know O
that O
no O
lie O
comes O
from O
the O
truth O
. O

So O
who O
is O
the O
liar O
? O

It O
is O
the O
one O
who O
says O
Jesus O
is O
not O
the O
Christ O
. O

Whoever O
says O
that O
is O
the O
enemy O
of O
Christ O
-- O
the O
one O
who O
does O
not O
believe O
in O
the O
Father O
or O
in O
his O
Son O
. O

Whoever O
does O
not O
believe O
in O
the O
Son O
does O
not O
have O
the O
Father O
, O
but O
whoever O
accepts O
the O
Son O
has O
the O
Father O
too O
. O

Be O
sure O
that O
you O
continue O
to O
follow O
the O
teaching O
you O
heard O
from O
the O
beginning O
. O

If O
you O
do O
that O
, O
you O
will O
always O
be O
in O
the O
Son O
and O
in O
the O
Father O
. O

And O
this O
is O
what O
the O
Son O
promised O
us O
-- O
eternal O
life O
. O

I O
am O
writing O
this O
letter O
about O
those O
who O
are O
trying O
to O
lead O
you O
into O
the O
wrong O
way O
. O

Christ O
gave O
you O
a O
special O
gift O
. O

You O
still O
have O
this O
gift O
in O
you O
. O

So O
you O
do O
n't O
need O
anyone O
to O
teach O
you O
. O

The O
gift O
he O
gave O
you O
teaches O
you O
about O
everything O
. O

It O
is O
a O
true O
gift O
, O
not O
a O
false O
one O
. O

So O
continue O
to O
live O
in O
Christ O
, O
as O
his O
gift O
taught O
you O
. O

Yes O
, O
my O
dear O
children O
, O
live O
in O
him O
. O

If O
we O
do O
this O
, O
we O
can O
be O
without O
fear O
on O
the O
day O
when O
Christ O
comes O
again O
. O

We O
will O
not O
need O
to O
hide O
and O
be O
ashamed O
when O
he O
comes O
. O

You O
know O
that O
Christ O
always O
did O
what O
was O
right O
. O

So O
you O
know O
that O
all O
those O
who O
do O
what O
is O
right O
are O
God O
's O
children O
. O

The O
people O
who O
believe O
that O
Jesus O
is O
the O
Christ O
are O
God O
's O
children O
. O

Anyone O
who O
loves O
the O
Father O
also O
loves O
the O
Father O
's O
children O
. O

How O
do O
we O
know O
that O
we O
love O
God O
's O
children O
? O

We O
know O
because O
we O
love O
God O
and O
we O
obey O
his O
commands O
. O

Loving O
God O
means O
obeying O
his O
commands O
. O

And O
God O
's O
commands O
are O
not O
too O
hard O
for O
us O
, O
because O
everyone O
who O
is O
a O
child O
of O
God O
has O
the O
power O
to O
win O
against O
the O
world O
. O

It O
is O
our O
faith O
that O
has O
won O
the O
victory O
against O
the O
world O
. O

So O
who O
wins O
against O
the O
world O
? O

Only O
those O
who O
believe O
that O
Jesus O
is O
the O
Son O
of O
God O
. O

Jesus O
Christ O
is O
the O
one O
who O
came O
. O

He O
came O
with O
water O
and O
with O
blood O
. O

He O
did O
not O
come O
by O
water O
only O
. O

No O
, O
Jesus O
came O
by O
both O
water O
and O
blood O
. O

And O
the O
Spirit O
tells O
us O
that O
this O
is O
true O
. O

The O
Spirit O
is O
the O
truth O
. O

So O
there O
are O
three O
witnesses O
that O
tell O
us O
about O
Jesus O
: O
the O
Spirit O
, O
the O
water O
, O
and O
the O
blood O
. O

These O
three O
witnesses O
agree O
. O

We O
believe O
people O
when O
they O
say O
something O
is O
true O
. O

But O
what O
God O
says O
is O
more O
important O
. O

And O
this O
is O
what O
God O
told O
us O
: O
He O
told O
us O
the O
truth O
about O
his O
own O
Son O
. O

Whoever O
believes O
in O
the O
Son O
of O
God O
has O
the O
truth O
that O
God O
told O
us O
. O

But O
people O
who O
do O
not O
believe O
God O
make O
God O
a O
liar O
, O
because O
they O
do O
not O
believe O
what O
God O
told O
us O
about O
his O
Son O
. O

This O
is O
what O
God O
told O
us O
: O
God O
has O
given O
us O
eternal O
life O
, O
and O
this O
life O
is O
in O
his O
Son O
. O

Whoever O
has O
the O
Son O
has O
life O
, O
but O
whoever O
does O
not O
have O
the O
Son O
of O
God O
does O
not O
have O
life O
. O

I O
write O
this O
letter O
to O
you O
who O
believe O
in O
the O
Son O
of O
God O
. O

I O
write O
so O
that O
you O
will O
know O
that O
you O
have O
eternal O
life O
now O
. O

We O
can O
come O
to O
God O
with O
no O
doubts O
. O

This O
means O
that O
when O
we O
ask O
God O
for O
things O
-LRB- O
and O
those O
things O
agree O
with O
what O
God O
wants O
for O
us O
-RRB- O
, O
God O
cares O
about O
what O
we O
say O
. O

He O
listens O
to O
us O
every O
time O
we O
ask O
him O
. O

So O
we O
know O
that O
he O
gives O
us O
whatever O
we O
ask O
from O
him O
. O

Suppose O
you O
see O
your O
fellow O
believer O
sinning O
-LRB- O
sin O
that O
does O
not O
lead O
to O
eternal O
death O
-RRB- O
. O

You O
should O
pray O
for O
them O
. O

Then O
God O
will O
give O
them O
life O
. O

I O
am O
talking O
about O
people O
whose O
sin O
does O
not O
lead O
to O
eternal O
death O
. O

There O
is O
sin O
that O
leads O
to O
death O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
mean O
that O
you O
should O
pray O
about O
that O
kind O
of O
sin O
. O

Doing O
wrong O
is O
always O
sin O
. O

But O
there O
is O
sin O
that O
does O
not O
lead O
to O
eternal O
death O
. O

We O
know O
that O
those O
who O
have O
been O
made O
God O
's O
children O
do O
not O
continue O
to O
sin O
. O

The O
Son O
of O
God O
keeps O
them O
safe O
. O

The O
Evil O
One O
can O
not O
hurt O
them O
. O

We O
know O
that O
we O
belong O
to O
God O
, O
but O
the O
Evil O
One O
controls O
the O
whole O
world O
. O

And O
we O
know O
that O
the O
Son O
of O
God O
has O
come O
and O
has O
given O
us O
understanding O
. O

So O
now O
we O
can O
know O
the O
one O
who O
is O
true O
, O
and O
we O
live O
in O
that O
true O
God O
. O

We O
are O
in O
his O
Son O
, O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

He O
is O
the O
true O
God O
, O
and O
he O
is O
eternal O
life O
. O

So O
, O
dear O
children O
, O
keep O
yourselves O
away O
from O
false O
gods O
. O

The O
Father O
has O
loved O
us O
so O
much O
! O

This O
shows O
how O
much O
he O
loved O
us O
: O
We O
are O
called O
children O
of O
God O
. O

And O
we O
really O
are O
his O
children O
. O

But O
the O
people O
in O
the O
world O
do O
n't O
understand O
that O
we O
are O
God O
's O
children O
, O
because O
they O
have O
not O
known O
him O
. O

Dear O
friends O
, O
now O
we O
are O
children O
of O
God O
. O

We O
have O
not O
yet O
been O
shown O
what O
we O
will O
be O
in O
the O
future O
. O

But O
we O
know O
that O
when O
Christ O
comes O
again O
, O
we O
will O
be O
like O
him O
. O

We O
will O
see O
him O
just O
as O
he O
is O
. O

He O
is O
pure O
, O
and O
everyone O
who O
has O
this O
hope O
in O
him O
keeps O
themselves O
pure O
like O
Christ O
. O

Anyone O
who O
sins O
breaks O
God O
's O
law O
. O

Yes O
, O
sinning O
is O
the O
same O
as O
living O
against O
God O
's O
law O
. O

You O
know O
that O
Christ O
came O
to O
take O
away O
people O
's O
sins O
. O

There O
is O
no O
sin O
in O
Christ O
. O

So O
whoever O
lives O
in O
Christ O
does O
not O
continue O
to O
sin O
. O

If O
they O
continue O
to O
sin O
, O
they O
have O
never O
really O
understood O
Christ O
and O
have O
never O
known O
him O
. O

Dear O
children O
, O
do O
n't O
let O
anyone O
lead O
you O
into O
the O
wrong O
way O
. O

Christ O
always O
did O
what O
was O
right O
. O

So O
to O
be O
good O
like O
Christ O
, O
you O
must O
do O
what O
is O
right O
. O

The O
devil O
has O
been O
sinning O
since O
the O
beginning O
. O

Anyone O
who O
continues O
to O
sin O
belongs O
to O
the O
devil O
. O

The O
Son O
of O
God O
came O
for O
this O
: O
to O
destroy O
the O
devil O
's O
work O
. O

Those O
who O
are O
God O
's O
children O
do O
not O
continue O
to O
sin O
, O
because O
the O
new O
life O
God O
gave O
them O
stays O
in O
them O
. O

They O
can O
not O
keep O
sinning O
, O
because O
they O
have O
become O
children O
of O
God O
. O

So O
we O
can O
see O
who O
God O
's O
children O
are O
and O
who O
the O
devil O
's O
children O
are O
. O

These O
are O
the O
ones O
who O
are O
not O
God O
's O
children O
: O
those O
who O
do O
n't O
do O
what O
is O
right O
and O
those O
who O
do O
not O
love O
their O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
in O
God O
's O
family O
. O

This O
is O
the O
teaching O
you O
have O
heard O
from O
the O
beginning O
: O
We O
must O
love O
each O
other O
. O

Do O
n't O
be O
like O
Cain O
. O

He O
belonged O
to O
the O
Evil O
One O
. O

Cain O
killed O
his O
brother O
. O

But O
why O
did O
he O
kill O
him O
? O

Because O
what O
Cain O
did O
was O
evil O
, O
and O
what O
his O
brother O
did O
was O
good O
. O

Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
do O
n't O
be O
surprised O
when O
the O
people O
of O
this O
world O
hate O
you O
. O

We O
know O
that O
we O
have O
left O
death O
and O
have O
come O
into O
life O
. O

We O
know O
this O
because O
we O
love O
each O
other O
as O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
. O

Anyone O
who O
does O
not O
love O
is O
still O
in O
death O
. O

Anyone O
who O
hates O
a O
fellow O
believer O
is O
a O
murderer O
. O

And O
you O
know O
that O
no O
murderer O
has O
eternal O
life O
. O

This O
is O
how O
we O
know O
what O
real O
love O
is O
: O
Jesus O
gave O
his O
life O
for O
us O
. O

So O
we O
should O
give O
our O
lives O
for O
each O
other O
as O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
. O

Suppose O
a O
believer O
who O
is O
rich O
enough O
to O
have O
all O
the O
necessities O
of O
life O
sees O
a O
fellow O
believer O
who O
is O
poor O
and O
does O
not O
have O
even O
basic O
needs O
. O

What O
if O
the O
rich O
believer O
does O
not O
help O
the O
poor O
one O
? O

Then O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
God O
's O
love O
is O
not O
in O
that O
person O
's O
heart O
. O

My O
children O
, O
our O
love O
should O
not O
be O
only O
words O
and O
talk O
. O

No O
, O
our O
love O
must O
be O
real O
. O

We O
must O
show O
our O
love O
by O
the O
things O
we O
do O
. O

That O
's O
how O
we O
know O
we O
belong O
to O
the O
way O
of O
truth O
. O

And O
when O
our O
hearts O
make O
us O
feel O
guilty O
, O
we O
can O
still O
have O
peace O
before O
God O
, O
because O
God O
is O
greater O
than O
our O
hearts O
. O

He O
knows O
everything O
. O

My O
dear O
friends O
, O
if O
we O
do O
n't O
feel O
that O
we O
are O
doing O
wrong O
, O
we O
can O
be O
without O
fear O
when O
we O
come O
to O
God O
. O

And O
God O
gives O
us O
what O
we O
ask O
for O
. O

We O
receive O
it O
because O
we O
obey O
God O
's O
commands O
and O
do O
what O
pleases O
him O
. O

This O
is O
what O
God O
commands O
: O
that O
we O
believe O
in O
his O
Son O
Jesus O
Christ O
, O
and O
that O
we O
love O
each O
other O
as O
he O
commanded O
. O

All O
who O
obey O
God O
's O
commands O
live O
in O
God O
. O

And O
God O
lives O
in O
them O
. O

How O
do O
we O
know O
that O
God O
lives O
in O
us O
? O

We O
know O
because O
of O
the O
Spirit O
he O
gave O
us O
. O

I O
want O
you O
to O
know O
that O
I O
am O
trying O
very O
hard O
to O
help O
you O
. O

And O
I O
am O
trying O
to O
help O
those O
in O
Laodicea O
and O
others O
who O
have O
never O
seen O
me O
. O

I O
want O
them O
to O
be O
strengthened O
and O
joined O
together O
with O
love O
and O
to O
have O
the O
full O
confidence O
that O
comes O
from O
understanding O
. O

I O
want O
them O
to O
know O
completely O
the O
secret O
truth O
that O
God O
has O
made O
known O
. O

That O
truth O
is O
Christ O
himself O
. O

In O
him O
all O
the O
treasures O
of O
wisdom O
and O
knowledge O
are O
kept O
safe O
. O

I O
tell O
you O
this O
so O
that O
no O
one O
can O
fool O
you O
by O
telling O
you O
ideas O
that O
seem O
good O
, O
but O
are O
false O
. O

Even O
though O
I O
am O
far O
away O
, O
my O
thoughts O
are O
always O
with O
you O
. O

I O
am O
happy O
to O
see O
your O
good O
lives O
and O
your O
strong O
faith O
in O
Christ O
. O

You O
accepted O
Christ O
Jesus O
as O
Lord O
, O
so O
continue O
to O
live O
following O
him O
. O

You O
must O
depend O
on O
Christ O
only O
, O
drawing O
life O
and O
strength O
from O
him O
. O

Just O
as O
you O
were O
taught O
the O
truth O
, O
continue O
to O
grow O
stronger O
in O
your O
understanding O
of O
it O
. O

And O
never O
stop O
giving O
thanks O
to O
God O
. O

Be O
sure O
you O
are O
not O
led O
away O
by O
the O
teaching O
of O
those O
who O
have O
nothing O
worth O
saying O
and O
only O
plan O
to O
deceive O
you O
. O

That O
teaching O
is O
not O
from O
Christ O
. O

It O
is O
only O
human O
tradition O
and O
comes O
from O
the O
powers O
that O
influence O
this O
world O
. O

I O
say O
this O
because O
all O
of O
God O
lives O
in O
Christ O
fully O
, O
even O
in O
his O
life O
on O
earth O
. O

And O
because O
you O
belong O
to O
Christ O
you O
are O
complete O
, O
having O
everything O
you O
need O
. O

Christ O
is O
ruler O
over O
every O
other O
power O
and O
authority O
. O

In O
Christ O
you O
had O
a O
different O
kind O
of O
circumcision O
, O
one O
that O
was O
not O
done O
by O
human O
hands O
. O

That O
is O
, O
you O
were O
made O
free O
from O
the O
power O
of O
your O
sinful O
self O
. O

That O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
circumcision O
Christ O
does O
. O

When O
you O
were O
baptized O
, O
you O
were O
buried O
with O
Christ O
, O
and O
you O
were O
raised O
up O
with O
him O
because O
of O
your O
faith O
in O
God O
's O
power O
. O

God O
's O
power O
was O
shown O
when O
he O
raised O
Christ O
from O
death O
. O

You O
were O
spiritually O
dead O
because O
of O
your O
sins O
and O
because O
you O
were O
not O
free O
from O
the O
power O
of O
your O
sinful O
self O
. O

But O
God O
gave O
you O
new O
life O
together O
with O
Christ O
. O

He O
forgave O
all O
our O
sins O
. O

Because O
we O
broke O
God O
's O
laws O
, O
we O
owed O
a O
debt O
-- O
a O
debt O
that O
listed O
all O
the O
rules O
we O
failed O
to O
follow O
. O

But O
God O
forgave O
us O
of O
that O
debt O
. O

He O
took O
it O
away O
and O
nailed O
it O
to O
the O
cross O
. O

He O
defeated O
the O
rulers O
and O
powers O
of O
the O
spiritual O
world O
. O

With O
the O
cross O
he O
won O
the O
victory O
over O
them O
and O
led O
them O
away O
as O
defeated O
and O
powerless O
prisoners O
for O
the O
whole O
world O
to O
see O
. O

So O
do O
n't O
let O
anyone O
make O
rules O
for O
you O
about O
eating O
and O
drinking O
or O
about O
Jewish O
customs O
-LRB- O
festivals O
, O
New O
Moon O
celebrations O
, O
or O
Sabbath O
days O
-RRB- O
. O

In O
the O
past O
these O
things O
were O
like O
a O
shadow O
that O
showed O
what O
was O
coming O
. O

But O
the O
new O
things O
that O
were O
coming O
are O
found O
in O
Christ O
. O

Some O
people O
enjoy O
acting O
as O
if O
they O
are O
humble O
and O
love O
to O
worship O
angels O
. O

They O
always O
talk O
about O
the O
visions O
they O
have O
seen O
. O

Do O
n't O
listen O
to O
them O
when O
they O
say O
you O
are O
wrong O
because O
you O
do O
n't O
do O
these O
things O
. O

It O
is O
so O
foolish O
for O
them O
to O
feel O
such O
pride O
, O
because O
it O
is O
all O
based O
on O
their O
own O
human O
ideas O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
keep O
themselves O
under O
the O
control O
of O
the O
head O
. O

Christ O
is O
the O
head O
, O
and O
the O
whole O
body O
depends O
on O
him O
. O

Because O
of O
Christ O
all O
the O
parts O
of O
the O
body O
care O
for O
each O
other O
and O
help O
each O
other O
. O

So O
the O
body O
is O
made O
stronger O
and O
held O
together O
as O
God O
causes O
it O
to O
grow O
. O

You O
died O
with O
Christ O
and O
were O
made O
free O
from O
the O
powers O
that O
influence O
this O
world O
. O

So O
why O
do O
you O
act O
as O
if O
you O
still O
belong O
to O
the O
world O
? O

I O
mean O
, O
why O
do O
you O
follow O
rules O
like O
these O
: O
`` O

Do O
n't O
eat O
this O
, O
'' O
`` O
Do O
n't O
taste O
that O
, O
'' O
`` O
Do O
n't O
touch O
that O
'' O
? O

These O
rules O
are O
talking O
about O
earthly O
things O
that O
are O
gone O
after O
they O
are O
used O
. O

They O
are O
only O
human O
commands O
and O
teachings O
. O

These O
rules O
may O
seem O
to O
be O
wise O
as O
part O
of O
a O
made O
- O
up O
religion O
in O
which O
people O
pretend O
to O
be O
humble O
and O
punish O
their O
bodies O
. O

But O
they O
do O
n't O
help O
people O
stop O
doing O
the O
evil O
that O
the O
sinful O
self O
wants O
to O
do O
. O

You O
were O
raised O
from O
death O
with O
Christ O
. O

So O
live O
for O
what O
is O
in O
heaven O
, O
where O
Christ O
is O
sitting O
at O
the O
right O
hand O
of O
God O
. O

Think O
only O
about O
what O
is O
up O
there O
, O
not O
what O
is O
here O
on O
earth O
. O

Your O
old O
self O
has O
died O
, O
and O
your O
new O
life O
is O
kept O
with O
Christ O
in O
God O
. O

Yes O
, O
Christ O
is O
now O
your O
life O
, O
and O
when O
he O
comes O
again O
, O
you O
will O
share O
in O
his O
glory O
. O

So O
put O
everything O
evil O
out O
of O
your O
life O
: O
sexual O
sin O
, O
doing O
anything O
immoral O
, O
letting O
sinful O
thoughts O
control O
you O
, O
and O
wanting O
things O
that O
are O
wrong O
. O

And O
do O
n't O
keep O
wanting O
more O
and O
more O
for O
yourself O
, O
which O
is O
the O
same O
as O
worshiping O
a O
false O
god O
. O

God O
will O
show O
his O
anger O
against O
those O
who O
do O
n't O
obey O
him O
, O
because O
they O
do O
these O
evil O
things O
. O

You O
also O
did O
these O
things O
in O
the O
past O
, O
when O
you O
lived O
like O
them O
. O

But O
now O
put O
these O
things O
out O
of O
your O
life O
: O
anger O
, O
losing O
your O
temper O
, O
doing O
or O
saying O
things O
to O
hurt O
others O
, O
and O
saying O
shameful O
things O
. O

Do O
n't O
lie O
to O
each O
other O
. O

You O
have O
taken O
off O
those O
old O
clothes O
-- O
the O
person O
you O
once O
were O
and O
the O
bad O
things O
you O
did O
then O
. O

Now O
you O
are O
wearing O
a O
new O
life O
, O
a O
life O
that O
is O
new O
every O
day O
. O

You O
are O
growing O
in O
your O
understanding O
of O
the O
one O
who O
made O
you O
. O

You O
are O
becoming O
more O
and O
more O
like O
him O
. O

In O
this O
new O
life O
it O
does O
n't O
matter O
if O
you O
are O
a O
Greek O
or O
a O
Jew O
, O
circumcised O
or O
not O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
matter O
if O
you O
speak O
a O
different O
language O
or O
even O
if O
you O
are O
a O
Scythian O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
matter O
if O
you O
are O
a O
slave O
or O
free O
. O

Christ O
is O
all O
that O
matters O
, O
and O
he O
is O
in O
all O
of O
you O
. O

God O
has O
chosen O
you O
and O
made O
you O
his O
holy O
people O
. O

He O
loves O
you O
. O

So O
your O
new O
life O
should O
be O
like O
this O
: O
Show O
mercy O
to O
others O
. O

Be O
kind O
, O
humble O
, O
gentle O
, O
and O
patient O
. O

Do O
n't O
be O
angry O
with O
each O
other O
, O
but O
forgive O
each O
other O
. O

If O
you O
feel O
someone O
has O
wronged O
you O
, O
forgive O
them O
. O

Forgive O
others O
because O
the O
Lord O
forgave O
you O
. O

Together O
with O
these O
things O
, O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
your O
new O
life O
is O
to O
love O
each O
other O
. O

Love O
is O
what O
holds O
everything O
together O
in O
perfect O
unity O
. O

Let O
the O
peace O
that O
Christ O
gives O
control O
your O
thinking O
. O

It O
is O
for O
peace O
that O
you O
were O
chosen O
to O
be O
together O
in O
one O
body O
. O

And O
always O
be O
thankful O
. O

Let O
the O
teaching O
of O
Christ O
live O
inside O
you O
richly O
. O

Use O
all O
wisdom O
to O
teach O
and O
counsel O
each O
other O
. O

Sing O
psalms O
, O
hymns O
, O
and O
spiritual O
songs O
with O
thankfulness O
in O
your O
hearts O
to O
God O
. O

Everything O
you O
say O
and O
everything O
you O
do O
should O
be O

for O
Jesus O
your O
Lord O
. O

And O
in O

Servants O

everything O
. O

Obey O
all O
the O
time O
, O
even O
when O
they O
ca O
n't O
see O
you O
. O

Do O
n't O
just O
pretend O
to O
work O
hard O
so O
that O
they O
will O
treat O
you O
well O
. O

No O
, O
you O
must O
serve O
your O
masters O
honestly O
because O
you O
respect O
the O
Lord O
. O

In O
all O
the O
work O
you O
are O
given O
, O
do O
the O
best O
you O

. O

Work O
as O

you O

working O
for O
the O
Lord O

not O
any O

Remember O
that O
you O
will O
receive O
your O
reward O

the O
Lord O
, O
who O
will O
give O
you O
what O

Also O
pray O

this O

News O
is O
bringing O
blessings O

is O
spreading O

And O
that O
's O
what O
has O
been O
happening O
among O
you O
since O
the O
first O
time O
you O
heard O
it O
and O
understood O
the O
truth O
about O
God O
's O
grace O
. O

You O
heard O
it O
from O
Epaphras O
, O
our O
dear O
friend O
and O

. O

He O
is O
a O
faithful O

. O

He O
also O

us O
about O
the O
love O

Spirit O
. O

Since O
the O
day O
we O
heard O
these O
things O
about O
you O
, O
we O
have O
continued O
praying O
for O
you O
. O

This O
is O
what O
we O
pray O
: O
that O
God O
will O
make O
you O
completely O
sure O
of O
what O
he O
wants O
by O
giving O
you O
all O
the O
wisdom O
and O
spiritual O
understanding O
you O
need O
; O
that O
this O
will O
help O
you O
live O
in O
a O
way O
that O
brings O
honor O
to O
the O
Lord O
and O
pleases O
him O
in O
every O
way O
; O
that O
your O
life O
will O
produce O
good O
works O
of O
every O
kind O
and O
that O
you O
will O
grow O
in O
your O
knowledge O
of O
God O
; O
that O
God O
will O
strengthen O
you O
with O
his O
own O
great O
power O
, O
so O
that O
you O
will O
be O
patient O
and O
not O
give O
up O
when O
troubles O
come O
. O

Then O
you O
will O
be O
happy O
and O
give O
thanks O
to O
the O
Father O
. O

He O
has O
made O
you O
able O
to O
have O
what O
he O
has O
promised O
to O
give O
all O
his O
holy O
people O
, O
who O
live O
in O
the O
light O
. O

God O
made O
us O
free O
from O
the O
power O
of O
darkness O
. O

And O
he O
brought O
us O
into O
the O
kingdom O
of O
his O
dear O
Son O
. O

The O
Son O
paid O
the O
price O
to O
make O
us O
free O
. O

In O
him O
we O
have O
forgiveness O
of O
our O
sins O
. O

No O
one O
can O
see O
God O
, O
but O
the O
Son O
is O
exactly O
like O
God O
. O

He O
rules O
over O
everything O
that O
has O
been O
made O
. O

Through O
his O
power O
all O
things O
were O
made O
: O
things O
in O
heaven O
and O
on O
earth O
, O
seen O
and O
not O
seen O
-- O
all O
spiritual O
rulers O
, O
lords O
, O
powers O
, O
and O
authorities O
. O

Everything O
was O
made O
through O
him O
and O
for O
him O
. O

The O
Son O
was O
there O
before O
anything O
was O
made O
. O

And O
all O
things O
continue O
because O
of O
him O
. O

He O
is O
the O
head O
of O
the O
body O
, O
which O
is O
the O
church O
. O

He O
is O
the O
beginning O
of O
everything O
else O
. O

And O
he O
is O
the O
first O
among O
all O
who O
will O
be O
raised O
from O
death O
. O

So O
in O
everything O
he O
is O
most O
important O
. O

God O
was O
pleased O
for O
all O
of O
himself O
to O
live O
in O
the O
Son O
. O

And O
through O
him O
, O
God O
was O
happy O
to O
bring O
all O
things O
back O
to O
himself O
again O
-- O
things O
on O
earth O
and O
things O
in O
heaven O
. O

God O
made O
peace O
by O
using O
the O
blood O
sacrifice O
of O
his O
Son O
on O
the O
cross O
. O

At O
one O
time O
you O
were O
separated O
from O
God O
. O

You O
were O
his O
enemies O
in O
your O
minds O
, O
because O
the O
evil O
you O
did O
was O
against O
him O
. O

But O
now O
he O
has O
made O
you O
his O
friends O
again O
. O

He O
did O
this O
by O
the O
death O
Christ O
suffered O
while O
he O
was O
in O
his O
body O
. O

He O
did O
it O
so O
that O
he O
could O
present O
you O
to O
himself O
as O
people O
who O
are O
holy O
, O
blameless O
, O
and O
without O
anything O
that O
would O
make O
you O
guilty O
before O
him O
. O

And O
that O
is O
what O
will O
happen O
if O
you O
continue O
to O
believe O
in O
the O
Good O
News O
you O
heard O
. O

You O
must O
remain O
strong O
and O
sure O
in O
your O
faith O
. O

You O
must O
not O
let O
anything O
cause O
you O
to O
give O
up O
the O
hope O
that O
became O
yours O
when O
you O
heard O
the O
Good O
News O
. O

That O
same O
Good O
News O
has O
been O
told O
to O
everyone O
on O
earth O
, O
and O
that O
's O
the O
work O
that O
I O
, O
Paul O
, O
was O
given O
to O
do O
. O

I O
am O
happy O
in O
my O
sufferings O
for O
you O
. O

There O
is O
much O
that O
Christ O
must O
still O
suffer O
. O

And O
I O
gladly O
accept O
my O
part O
of O
those O
sufferings O
in O
my O
body O
for O
the O
good O
of O
his O
body O
, O
the O
church O
. O

I O
became O
a O
servant O
of O
the O
church O
because O
God O
gave O
me O
a O
special O
work O
to O
do O
. O

This O
work O
helps O
you O
. O

My O
work O
is O
to O
tell O
the O
complete O
message O
of O
God O
. O

This O
message O
is O
the O
secret O
truth O
that O
was O
hidden O
since O
the O
beginning O
of O
time O
. O

It O
was O
hidden O
from O
everyone O
for O
ages O
, O
but O
now O
it O
has O
been O
made O
known O
to O
God O
's O
holy O
people O
. O

God O
decided O
to O
let O
his O
people O
know O
just O
how O
rich O
and O
glorious O
that O
truth O
is O
. O

That O
secret O
truth O
, O
which O
is O
for O
all O
people O
, O
is O
that O
Christ O
lives O
in O
you O
, O
his O
people O
. O

He O
is O
our O
hope O
for O
glory O
. O

So O
we O
continue O
to O
tell O
people O
about O
Christ O
. O

We O
use O
all O
wisdom O
to O
counsel O
every O
person O
and O
teach O
every O
person O
. O

We O
are O
trying O
to O
bring O
everyone O
before O
God O
as O
people O
who O
have O
grown O
to O
be O
spiritually O
mature O
in O
Christ O
. O

To O
do O
this O
, O
I O
work O
and O
struggle O
using O
the O
great O
strength O
that O
Christ O
gives O
me O
. O

That O
strength O
is O
working O
in O
my O
life O
. O

You O
, O
however O
, O
must O
tell O
everyone O
how O
to O
live O
in O
a O
way O
that O
agrees O
with O
the O
true O
teaching O
. O

Teach O
the O
older O
men O
to O
have O
self O
- O
control O
, O
to O
be O
serious O
, O
and O
to O
be O
wise O
. O

They O
must O
be O
strong O
in O
faith O
, O
in O
love O
, O
and O
in O
patience O
. O

Also O
, O
teach O
the O
older O
women O
to O
live O
the O
way O
those O
who O
serve O
the O
Lord O
should O
live O
. O

They O
should O
not O
go O
around O
saying O
bad O
things O
about O
others O
or O
be O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
drinking O
too O
much O
. O

They O
should O
teach O
what O
is O
good O
. O

By O
doing O
this O
they O
will O
teach O
the O
younger O
women O
to O
love O
their O
husbands O
and O
children O
. O

They O
will O
teach O
them O
to O
be O
wise O
and O
pure O
, O
to O
take O
care O
of O
their O
homes O
, O
to O
be O
kind O
, O
and O
to O
be O
willing O
to O
serve O
their O
husbands O
. O

Then O
no O
one O
will O
be O
able O
to O
criticize O
the O
teaching O
God O
gave O
us O
. O

In O
the O
same O
way O
, O
tell O
the O
young O
men O
to O
be O
wise O
. O

You O
should O
be O
an O
example O
for O
them O
in O
every O
way O
by O
the O
good O
things O
you O
do O
. O

When O
you O
teach O
, O
be O
honest O
and O
serious O
. O

And O
your O
teaching O
should O
be O
clearly O
right O
so O
that O
you O
can O
not O
be O
criticized O
. O

Then O
anyone O
who O
is O
against O
you O
will O
be O
ashamed O
. O

There O
will O
not O
be O
anything O
bad O
they O
can O
say O
about O
us O
. O

And O
tell O
this O
to O
those O
who O
are O
slaves O
: O
They O
should O
be O
willing O
to O
serve O
their O
masters O
at O
all O
times O
; O
they O
should O
try O
to O
please O
them O
, O
not O
argue O
with O
them O
; O
they O
should O
not O
steal O
from O
them O
; O
and O
they O
should O
show O
their O
masters O
that O
they O
can O
be O
trusted O
. O

Then O
, O
in O
everything O
they O
do O
, O
they O
will O
show O
that O
the O
teaching O
of O
God O
our O
Savior O
is O
good O
. O

That O
is O
the O
way O
we O
should O
live O
, O
because O
God O
's O
grace O
has O
come O
. O

That O
grace O
can O
save O
everyone O
. O

It O
teaches O
us O
not O
to O
live O
against O
God O
and O
not O
to O
do O
the O
bad O
things O
the O
world O
wants O
to O
do O
. O

It O
teaches O
us O
to O
live O
on O
earth O
now O
in O
a O
wise O
and O
right O
way O
-- O
a O
way O
that O
shows O
true O
devotion O
to O
God O
. O

We O
should O
live O
like O
that O
while O
we O
are O
waiting O
for O
the O
coming O
of O
our O
great O
God O
and O
Savior O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

He O
is O
our O
great O
hope O
, O
and O
he O
will O
come O
with O
glory O
. O

He O
gave O
himself O
for O
us O
. O

He O
died O
to O
free O
us O
from O
all O
evil O
. O

He O
died O
to O
make O
us O
pure O
-- O
people O
who O
belong O
only O
to O
him O
and O
who O
always O
want O
to O
do O
good O
. O

These O
are O
the O
things O
you O
should O
tell O
people O
. O

Encourage O
them O
, O
and O
when O
they O
are O
wrong O
, O
correct O
them O
. O

You O
have O
full O
authority O
to O
do O
this O
, O
so O
do O
n't O
let O
anyone O
think O
they O
can O
ignore O
you O
. O

Remind O
your O
people O
that O
they O
should O
always O
be O
under O
the O
authority O
of O
rulers O
and O
government O
leaders O
. O

They O
should O
obey O
these O
leaders O
and O
be O
ready O
to O
do O
good O
. O

Tell O
them O
not O
to O
speak O
evil O
of O
anyone O
but O
to O
live O
in O
peace O
with O
others O
. O

They O
should O
be O
gentle O
and O
polite O
to O
everyone O
. O

In O
the O
past O
we O
were O
foolish O
too O
. O

We O
did O
not O
obey O
, O
we O
were O
wrong O
, O
and O
we O
were O
slaves O
to O
the O
many O
things O
our O
bodies O
wanted O
and O
enjoyed O
. O

We O
lived O
doing O
evil O
and O
being O
jealous O
. O

People O
hated O
us O
and O
we O
hated O
each O
other O
. O

But O
then O
the O
kindness O
and O
love O
of O
God O
our O
Savior O
was O
made O
known O
. O

He O
saved O
us O
because O
of O
his O
mercy O
, O
not O
because O
of O
any O
good O
things O
we O
did O
. O

He O
saved O
us O
through O
the O
washing O
that O
made O
us O
new O
people O
. O

He O
saved O
us O
by O
making O
us O
new O
through O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
. O

God O
poured O
out O
to O
us O
that O
Holy O
Spirit O
fully O
through O
Jesus O
Christ O
our O
Savior O
. O

We O
were O
made O
right O
with O
God O
by O
his O
grace O
. O

God O
saved O
us O
so O
that O
we O
could O
be O
his O
children O
and O
look O
forward O
to O
receiving O
life O
that O
never O
ends O
. O

This O
is O
a O
true O
statement O
. O

And O
I O
want O
you O
to O
be O
sure O
that O
the O
people O
understand O
these O
things O
. O

Then O
those O
who O
believe O
in O
God O
will O
be O
careful O
to O
use O
their O
lives O
for O
doing O
good O
. O

These O
things O
are O
good O
and O
will O
help O
everyone O
. O

Stay O
away O
from O
those O
who O
have O
foolish O
arguments O
, O
who O
talk O
about O
useless O
family O
histories O
, O
or O
who O
make O
trouble O
and O
fight O
about O
what O
the O
Law O
of O
Moses O
teaches O
. O

These O
things O
are O
useless O
and O
will O
not O
help O
anyone O
. O

Give O
a O
warning O
to O
all O
those O
who O
cause O
arguments O
. O

If O
they O
continue O
to O
cause O
trouble O
after O
a O
second O
warning O
, O
then O
do O
n't O
associate O
with O
them O
. O

You O
know O
that O
people O
like O
that O
are O
evil O
and O
sinful O
. O

Their O
sins O
prove O
they O
are O
wrong O
. O

I O
will O
send O
Artemas O
and O
Tychicus O
to O
you O
. O

When O
I O
send O
them O
, O
try O
hard O
to O
come O
to O
me O
at O
Nicopolis O
. O

I O
have O
decided O
to O
stay O
there O
this O
winter O
. O

Zenas O
the O
lawyer O
and O
Apollos O
will O
be O
traveling O
from O
there O
. O

Do O
all O
that O
you O
can O
to O
help O
them O
prepare O
for O
their O
trip O
. O

Be O
sure O
that O
they O
have O
everything O
they O
need O
. O

Our O
people O
must O
learn O
to O
use O
their O
lives O
for O
doing O
good O
and O
helping O
anyone O
who O
has O
a O
need O
. O

Then O
they O
will O
not O
have O
empty O
lives O
. O

All O
the O
people O
with O
me O
here O
send O
you O
their O
greetings O
. O

Give O
my O
greetings O
to O
those O
who O
love O
us O
in O
the O
faith O
. O

Grace O
be O
with O
you O
all O
. O

Greetings O
from O
Paul O
, O
a O
servant O
of O
God O
and O
an O
apostle O
of O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

I O
was O
sent O
to O
help O
God O
's O
chosen O
people O
have O
faith O
and O
understand O
the O
truth O
that O
produces O
a O
life O
of O
devotion O
to O
God O
. O

This O
faith O
and O
knowledge O
make O
us O
sure O
that O
we O
have O
eternal O
life O
. O

God O
promised O
that O
life O
to O
us O
before O
time O
began O
-- O
and O
God O
does O
not O
lie O
. O

At O
the O
right O
time O
, O
God O
let O
the O
world O
know O
about O
that O
life O
. O

He O
did O
this O
through O
the O
telling O
of O
the O
Good O
News O
message O
, O
and O
he O
trusted O
me O
with O
that O
work O
. O

I O
told O
people O
that O
message O
because O
God O
our O
Savior O
commanded O
me O
to O
. O

To O
Titus O
, O
a O
true O
son O
to O
me O
in O
the O
faith O
we O
share O
together O
. O

Grace O
and O
peace O
to O
you O
from O
God O
the O
Father O
and O
Christ O
Jesus O
our O
Savior O
. O

I O
left O
you O
in O
Crete O
so O
that O
you O
could O
finish O
doing O
what O
still O
needed O
to O
be O
done O
. O

And O
I O
also O
left O
you O
there O
so O
that O
you O
could O
choose O
men O
to O
be O
elders O
in O
every O
town O
. O

To O
be O
an O
elder O
, O
a O
man O
must O
not O
be O
guilty O
of O
living O
in O
a O
wrong O
way O
. O

He O
must O
be O
faithful O
to O
his O
wife O
, O
and O
his O
children O
must O
be O
faithful O
to O
God O
. O

They O
must O
not O
be O
known O
as O
children O
who O
are O
wild O
or O
do O
n't O
obey O
. O

An O
elder O
has O
the O
job O
of O
taking O
care O
of O
God O
's O
work O
. O

So O
people O
should O
not O
be O
able O
to O
say O
that O
he O
lives O
in O
a O
wrong O
way O
. O

He O
must O
not O
be O
someone O
who O
is O
proud O
and O
selfish O
or O
who O
gets O
angry O
quickly O
. O

He O
must O
not O
drink O
too O
much O
, O
and O
he O
must O
not O
be O
someone O
who O
likes O
to O
fight O
. O

He O
must O
not O
be O
a O
man O
who O
will O
do O
almost O
anything O
for O
money O
. O

An O
elder O
must O
be O
ready O
to O
help O
people O
by O
welcoming O
them O
into O
his O
home O
. O

He O
must O
love O
what O
is O
good O
. O

He O
must O
be O
wise O
. O

He O
must O
live O
right O
. O

He O
must O
be O
devoted O
to O
God O
and O
pleasing O
to O
him O
. O

And O
he O
must O
be O
able O
to O
control O
himself O
. O

An O
elder O
must O
be O
faithful O
to O
the O
same O
true O
message O
we O
teach O
. O

Then O
he O
will O
be O
able O
to O
encourage O
others O
with O
teaching O
that O
is O
true O
and O
right O
. O

And O
he O
will O
be O
able O
to O
show O
those O
who O
are O
against O
this O
teaching O
that O
they O
are O
wrong O
. O

This O
is O
important O
, O
because O
there O
are O
many O
people O
who O
refuse O
to O
obey O
-- O
people O
who O
talk O
about O
worthless O
things O
and O
mislead O
others O
. O

I O
am O
talking O
especially O
about O
those O
who O
say O
that O
men O
who O
are O
not O
Jews O
must O
be O
circumcised O
to O
please O
God O
. O

These O
people O
must O
be O
stopped O
, O
because O
they O
are O
destroying O
whole O
families O
by O
teaching O
what O
they O
should O
not O
teach O
. O

They O
teach O
only O
to O
cheat O
people O
and O
make O
money O
. O

Even O
one O
of O
their O
own O
prophets O
said O
, O
`` O
Cretans O
are O
always O
liars O
. O

They O
are O
evil O
animals O
and O
lazy O
people O
who O
do O
nothing O
but O
eat O
. O
'' O

The O
words O
that O
prophet O
said O
are O
true O
. O

So O
tell O
those O
people O
that O
they O
are O
wrong O
. O

You O
must O
be O
strict O
with O
them O
. O

Then O
they O
will O
become O
strong O
in O
the O
faith O
, O
and O
they O
will O
stop O
paying O
attention O
to O
the O
stories O
told O
by O
those O
Jews O
. O

They O
will O
stop O
following O
the O
commands O
of O
those O
who O
have O
turned O
away O
from O
the O
truth O
. O

To O
people O
who O
are O
pure O
, O
everything O
is O
pure O
. O

But O
to O
those O
who O
are O
full O
of O
sin O
and O
do O
n't O
believe O
, O
nothing O
is O
pure O
. O

Really O
, O
their O
thinking O
has O
become O
evil O
and O
their O
consciences O
have O
been O
ruined O
. O

They O
say O
they O
know O
God O
, O
but O
the O
evil O
things O
they O
do O
show O
that O
they O
do O
n't O
accept O
him O
. O

They O
are O
disgusting O
. O

They O
refuse O
to O
obey O
God O
and O
are O
not O
capable O
of O
doing O
anything O
good O
. O

When O
Jesus O
finished O
these O
instructions O
for O
his O
twelve O
followers O
, O
he O
left O
there O
. O

He O
went O
to O
the O
towns O
in O
Galilee O
to O
teach O
the O
people O
and O
tell O
them O
God O
's O
message O
. O

When O
John O
was O
in O
prison O
, O
he O
heard O
about O
the O
things O
that O
were O
happening O
-- O
things O
the O
Christ O
would O
do O
. O

So O
he O
sent O
some O
of O
his O
followers O
to O
Jesus O
. O

They O
asked O
him O
, O
`` O
Are O
you O
the O
one O
we O
have O
been O
expecting O
, O
or O
should O
we O
wait O
for O
someone O
else O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
Go O
tell O
John O
what O
you O
have O
heard O
and O
seen O
: O
The O
blind O
can O
see O
. O

The O
crippled O
can O
walk O
. O

People O
with O
leprosy O
are O
healed O
. O

The O
deaf O
can O
hear O
. O

The O
dead O
are O
brought O
back O
to O
life O
. O

And O
the O
Good O
News O
is O
being O
told O
to O
the O
poor O
. O

Great O
blessings O
belong O
to O
those O
who O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
problem O
accepting O
me O
. O
'' O

When O
John O
's O
followers O
left O
, O
Jesus O
began O
talking O
to O
the O
people O
about O
John O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
What O
did O
you O
people O
go O
out O
to O
the O
desert O
to O
see O
? O

Someone O
who O
is O
weak O
, O
like O
a O
stem O
of O
grass O
blowing O
in O
the O
wind O
? O

Really O
, O
what O
did O
you O
expect O
to O
see O
? O

Someone O
dressed O
in O
fine O
clothes O
? O

Of O
course O
not O
. O

People O
who O
wear O
fine O
clothes O
are O
all O
in O
kings O
' O
palaces O
. O

So O
what O
did O
you O
go O
out O
to O
see O
? O

A O
prophet O
? O

Yes O
, O
John O
is O
a O
prophet O
. O

But O
I O
tell O
you O
, O
he O
is O
more O
than O
that O
. O

This O
Scripture O
was O
written O
about O
him O
: O
' O
Listen O
! O

I O

`` O
The O
truth O
is O
that O
John O
the O
Baptizer O
is O
greater O
than O
anyone O
who O
has O
ever O
come O
into O
this O
world O
. O

But O
even O
the O
least O
important O
person O
in O
God O
's O
kingdom O
is O
greater O
than O
John O
. O

Since O
the O
time O
John O
the O
Baptizer O
came O
until O
now O
, O
God O
's O
kingdom O
has O
been O
going O
forward O
strongly O
. O

And O
people O
have O
been O
trying O
to O
take O
control O
of O
it O
by O
force O
. O

Before O
John O
came O
, O
the O
Law O
of O
Moses O
and O
all O
the O
prophets O
told O
about O
the O
things O
that O
would O
happen O
. O

And O
if O
you O
believe O
what O
they O
said O
, O
then O
John O
is O
Elijah O
. O

He O
is O
the O
one O
they O
said O
would O
come O
. O

You O
people O
who O
hear O
me O
, O
listen O
! O

`` O
What O
can O
I O
say O
about O
the O
people O
who O
live O
today O
? O

What O
are O
they O
like O
? O

The O
people O
today O
are O
like O
children O
sitting O
in O
the O
marketplace O
. O

One O
group O
of O
children O
calls O
to O
the O
other O
group O
, O
' O
We O
played O
flute O
music O
for O
you O
, O
but O
you O
did O
not O
dance O
; O
we O
sang O
a O
funeral O
song O
, O
but O
you O
were O
not O
sad O
. O
' O

Why O
do O
I O
say O
people O
are O
like O
that O
? O

Because O
John O
came O
, O
not O
eating O
like O
other O
people O
or O
drinking O
wine O
, O
and O
people O
say O
, O
' O
He O
has O
a O
demon O
inside O
him O
. O
' O

The O
Son O
of O
Man O
came O
eating O
and O
drinking O
, O
and O
people O
say O
, O
' O
Look O
at O
him O
! O

He O
eats O
too O
much O
and O
drinks O
too O
much O
wine O

He O
's O
a O
friend O
of O
tax O
collectors O
and O
other O
sinners O
. O
' O

But O
wisdom O
is O
shown O
to O
be O
right O
by O
what O
it O
does O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
criticized O
the O
cities O
where O
he O
did O
most O
of O
his O
miracles O
. O

He O
criticized O
these O
cities O
because O
the O
people O
there O
did O
not O
change O
their O
lives O
and O
stop O
sinning O
. O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
It O
will O
be O
bad O
for O
you O
Chorazin O

It O
will O
be O
bad O
for O
you O
Bethsaida O

I O
did O
many O
miracles O
in O
you O

If O
these O

miracles O
had O
happened O
in O
Tyre O
and O
Sidon O
, O
the O
people O
there O
would O
have O
changed O
their O
lives O
a O
long O
time O
ago O
. O

They O
would O
have O
worn O
sackcloth O
and O
put O
ashes O
on O
themselves O
to O
show O
that O
they O
were O
sorry O
for O
their O
sins O
. O

But O
I O
tell O
you O
, O
on O
the O
day O
of O
judgment O
it O
will O
be O
worse O
for O
you O
than O
for O
Tyre O
and O
Sidon O

`` O
And O
you O

Capernaum O
, O
will O
you O

No O

You O
will O
be O
thrown O
down O
to O
the O
place O
of O
death O

I O
did O
many O
miracles O
in O

If O
these O

miracles O
had O
happened O
in O
Sodom O
, O
the O
people O
there O
would O
have O
stopped O
sinning O

it O
would O
still O

a O
city O
today O

But O
I O
tell O

will O
be O
worse O

in O
the O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
praise O
you O

Father O

I O
am O

these O
things O

those O
who O
are O
so O
wise O

so O
smart O

But O
you O
have O
shown O
them O
to O
people O
who O
are O
like O
little O
children O

Yes O
, O
Father O
, O
you O
did O
this O
because O
it O

what O
you O
really O
wanted O
to O
do O

`` O

And O
no O
one O

And O
the O
only O
people O
who O
will O

`` O

Yes O
, O
the O
teaching O
that O
I O

easy O

The O
load O
I O
give O

After O
Jesus O
finished O
saying O
all O
these O
things O
, O
he O
said O
to O
his O
followers O
, O
`` O
You O
know O
that O
the O

day O

will O
be O
handed O
over O
to O
his O
enemies O

be O
killed O
on O
a O
cross O

'' O

Then O
the O
leading O
priests O
and O
the O
older O
Jewish O
leaders O
had O
a O
meeting O
at O
the O
palace O
where O
the O
high O
priest O
lived O
. O

The O
high O
priest O
's O
name O
was O
Caiaphas O
. O

In O
the O
meeting O
they O
tried O
to O
find O
a O
way O
to O
arrest O
and O
kill O
Jesus O
without O
anyone O
knowing O
what O
they O
were O
doing O
. O

They O
planned O
to O
arrest O
Jesus O
and O
kill O
him O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
We O
can O
not O
arrest O
Jesus O
during O
Passover O

We O
do O
n't O
want O
the O
people O

become O
angry O
and O
cause O
a O
riot O

'' O

Jesus O
was O
in O
Bethany O
at O
the O
house O
of O
Simon O
the O
leper O
. O

While O
he O
was O
there O
, O
a O
woman O
came O
to O
him O
. O

She O
had O
an O
alabaster O
jar O
filled O
with O
expensive O
perfume O
. O

She O
poured O
the O
perfume O
on O
Jesus O
' O
head O
while O
he O
was O
eating O
. O

The O
followers O
saw O
the O
woman O
do O
this O
and O
were O
upset O
at O
her O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Why O
waste O
that O
perfume O
? O

It O
could O
be O
sold O
for O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
, O
and O
the O
money O
could O
be O
given O
to O
those O
who O
are O
poor O

'' O

But O
Jesus O
knew O
what O
happened O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Why O
are O
you O
bothering O
this O
woman O
? O

She O
did O
a O
very O
good O
thing O
for O

You O
will O
always O
have O
the O
poor O
with O
you O

But O
you O
will O
not O
always O
have O
me O
. O

This O
woman O
poured O
perfume O
on O
my O
body O
. O

She O
did O
this O
to O
prepare O
me O
for O
burial O
after O
I O
die O
. O

The O
Good O
News O
will O
be O
told O
to O
people O
all O
over O
the O
world O

And O
I O
can O
assure O
you O
that O
everywhere O
the O
Good O
News O
is O
told O
, O
the O
story O
of O
what O
this O
woman O
did O
will O
also O
be O
told O
, O
and O
people O
will O
remember O
her O

'' O

Then O
one O
of O
the O
twelve O
followers O
went O
to O
talk O
to O
the O
leading O
priests O
. O

This O
was O
the O
follower O
named O
Judas O
Iscariot O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
will O
hand O
Jesus O
over O
to O
you O

What O
will O
you O
pay O
me O
for O
doing O
this O
? O
'' O

The O
priests O
gave O
him O
30 O
silver O
coins O
. O

After O
that O
, O
Judas O
waited O
for O
the O
best O
time O
to O
hand O
Jesus O
over O
to O
them O
. O

On O
the O
first O
day O
of O
the O
Festival O
of O
Unleavened O
Bread O
, O
the O
followers O
came O
to O
Jesus O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
We O
will O
prepare O
everything O

eat O
the O
Passover O
meal O

Where O
do O
you O
want O
us O
to O
have O
the O
meal O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
Go O
into O
the O
city O

Go O
to O
a O
man O
I O
know O

Tell O
him O

Teacher O

chosen O
time O

the O
Passover O
meal O

my O

your O
house O

They O
obeyed O
and O
did O
what O
Jesus O
told O
them O
to O
do O
. O

They O
prepared O
the O
Passover O
meal O

In O
the O
evening O
Jesus O
was O
at O
the O
table O
with O
the O
twelve O
followers O
. O

They O
were O
all O
eating O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Believe O
me O
when O
I O
say O
that O
one O
of O
you O
twelve O
here O
will O
hand O
me O
over O

my O
enemies O

The O
followers O
were O
very O
sad O
to O
hear O
this O
. O

Each O
one O
said O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
surely O
I O
am O
not O
the O
one O
! O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
One O
who O
has O
dipped O
his O
bread O
in O
the O
same O
bowl O
with O
me O
will O
be O
the O
one O
to O
hand O
me O
over O

The O
Son O
of O
Man O
will O
suffer O
what O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
will O
happen O
to O
him O

But O
it O
will O
be O
very O
bad O
for O
the O
one O
who O
hands O
over O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O
to O
be O
killed O

It O
would O
be O
better O
for O
him O
if O

had O
never O
been O
born O

Then O
Judas O
, O
the O
very O
one O
who O
would O
hand O
him O
over O

said O
to O
Jesus O
, O
`` O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
it O
is O
you O

While O
they O
were O
eating O
, O
Jesus O
took O
some O
bread O
and O
thanked O
God O
for O
it O
. O

He O
broke O
off O
some O
pieces O
, O
gave O
them O
to O
his O
followers O
and O
said O
, O
`` O

Take O
this O
bread O
and O
eat O
it O

Then O
he O
took O
a O
cup O
of O
wine O
, O
thanked O
God O
for O
it O
, O
and O
gave O
it O
to O
them O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Each O
one O
of O

some O
of O
it O

This O
wine O
is O
my O
blood O

which O
will O
be O
poured O
out O

forgive O
the O
sins O

begin O
the O
new O
agreement O
from O
God O

I O
want O

I O

it O
again O

They O
all O
sang O
a O
song O
and O
then O
went O
out O
to O
the O
Mount O
of O
Olives O
. O

Jesus O
told O
the O
followers O
, O
`` O
Tonight O
you O
will O
all O
lose O
your O
faith O

The O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
' O
I O
will O
kill O
the O
shepherd O

sheep O

run O
away O

But O
after O
I O
am O
killed O
, O
I O
will O
rise O
from O
death O

Then O
I O
will O
go O
into O
Galilee O

I O
will O
be O
there O
before O
you O
go O
there O

Peter O
answered O
, O
`` O
All O
the O

may O
lose O
their O
faith O
in O
you O

But O
my O
faith O

never O
be O
shaken O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
The O
truth O
is O

tonight O
you O
will O
say O
you O
do O

will O
deny O
me O
three O
times O
before O
the O
rooster O
crows O

But O
Peter O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O

I O
will O
even O
die O

you O

And O
all O
the O
other O
followers O
said O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

Then O
Jesus O
went O
with O
his O
followers O
to O
a O
place O
called O
Gethsemane O
. O

He O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Sit O
here O
while O
I O
go O
there O
and O
pray O

He O
told O
Peter O
and O
the O
two O
sons O
of O
Zebedee O
to O
come O
with O
him O
. O

Then O
he O
began O
to O
be O
very O
sad O
and O
troubled O
. O

Jesus O
said O
to O
Peter O
and O
the O
two O
sons O
of O
Zebedee O
, O
`` O
My O
heart O
is O
so O
heavy O
with O
grief O
, O
I O
feel O
as O
if O
I O
am O
dying O

Wait O
here O
and O
stay O
awake O
with O
me O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
went O
on O
a O
little O
farther O
away O
from O
them O
. O

He O
fell O
to O
the O
ground O
and O
prayed O
, O
`` O
My O
Father O
, O
if O
it O
is O
possible O
, O
do O
n't O
make O
me O
drink O
from O
this O
cup O
. O

But O
do O
what O
you O
want O
, O
not O
what O
I O
want O

'' O

Then O
he O
went O
back O
to O
his O
followers O
and O
found O
them O
sleeping O

He O
said O
to O
Peter O
, O
`` O
Could O
you O
men O
not O
stay O
awake O
with O
me O
for O
one O
hour O
? O

Stay O
awake O
and O
pray O
for O
strength O
against O
temptation O
. O

Your O
spirit O
wants O
to O
do O
what O
is O
right O
, O
but O
your O
body O
is O
weak O

'' O

Then O
Jesus O
went O
away O
a O
second O
time O
and O
prayed O
, O
`` O

My O
Father O
, O
if O
I O
must O
do O
this O
and O
it O

it O

then O
I O
pray O
that O
what O

Then O
he O
went O
back O
to O
the O
followers O

Again O
he O
found O
them O
sleeping O

They O
could O
not O
stay O
awake O

So O
he O
left O
them O
and O
went O
away O
one O
more O
time O
and O
prayed O
. O

This O
third O
time O
he O
prayed O
, O
he O
said O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

Then O
Jesus O
went O
back O
to O
the O
followers O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Are O
you O
still O
sleeping O

resting O

time O

was O
still O
speaking O

one O
of O
the O
twelve O
apostles O
came O
there O
. O

He O
had O
a O
big O
crowd O
of O
people O
with O
him O
, O
all O
carrying O
swords O
and O
clubs O
. O

They O
had O
been O
sent O
from O
the O
leading O
priests O
and O
the O
older O
leaders O
of O
the O
people O
. O

Judas O
planned O
to O
do O
something O
to O
show O
them O
which O
one O
was O
Jesus O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
one O
I O
kiss O
will O
be O
Jesus O
. O

Arrest O
him O
. O
'' O

So O
he O
went O
to O
Jesus O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Hello O
, O
Teacher O
! O
'' O

Then O
Judas O
kissed O
him O
. O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
Friend O
, O
do O
the O
thing O
you O
came O
to O
do O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
men O
came O
and O
grabbed O
Jesus O
and O
arrested O
him O
. O

When O
that O
happened O
, O
one O
of O
the O
followers O
with O
Jesus O
grabbed O
his O
sword O
and O
pulled O
it O
out O
. O

He O
swung O
it O
at O
the O
servant O
of O
the O
high O
priest O
and O
cut O
off O
his O
ear O
. O

Jesus O
said O
to O
the O
man O
, O
`` O
Put O
your O
sword O
back O
in O
its O
place O
. O

People O
who O
use O
swords O
will O
be O
killed O
with O
swords O
. O

Surely O
you O
know O
I O
could O
ask O
my O
Father O
and O
he O
would O
give O
me O
more O
than O
twelve O
armies O
of O
angels O
. O

But O
it O
must O
happen O
this O
way O
to O
show O
the O
truth O
of O
what O
the O
Scriptures O
said O
. O
'' O
Then O
Jesus O
said O
to O
the O
crowd O
, O
`` O
Why O
do O
you O
come O
to O
get O
me O
with O
swords O
and O
clubs O
as O
if O
I O
were O
a O
criminal O
. O

Every O
day O
I O
sat O
in O
the O
Temple O
area O
teaching O
. O

You O
did O
not O
arrest O
me O
there O
. O

But O
all O
these O
things O
have O
happened O
to O
show O
the O
full O
meaning O
of O
what O
the O
prophets O
wrote O
. O
'' O

Then O
all O
of O
Jesus O
' O
followers O
left O
him O
and O
ran O
away O
. O

The O
men O
who O
arrested O
Jesus O
led O
him O
to O
the O
house O
of O
Caiaphas O
the O
high O
priest O
. O

The O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
and O
the O
older O
Jewish O
leaders O
were O
gathered O
there O
. O

Peter O
followed O
Jesus O
but O
stayed O
back O
at O
a O
distance O
. O

He O
followed O
him O
to O
the O
yard O
of O
the O
high O
priest O
's O
house O
. O

Peter O
went O
in O
and O
sat O
with O
the O
guards O
. O

He O
wanted O
to O
see O
what O
would O
happen O
to O
Jesus O
. O

The O
leading O
priests O
and O
the O
high O
council O
tried O
to O
find O
something O
against O
Jesus O
so O
that O
they O
could O
kill O
him O
. O

They O
tried O
to O
find O
people O
to O
lie O
and O
say O
that O
Jesus O
had O
done O
wrong O
. O

Many O
people O
came O
and O
told O
lies O
about O
him O
. O

But O
the O
council O
could O
find O
no O
real O
reason O
to O
kill O
him O
. O

Then O
two O
people O
came O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
This O
man O
said O
, O
' O
I O
can O
destroy O
the O
Temple O
of O
God O
and O
build O
it O
again O
in O
three O
days O
. O
' O
'' O

Then O
the O
high O
priest O
stood O
up O
and O
said O
to O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
you O
have O
anything O
to O
say O
about O
these O
charges O
against O
you O
? O

Are O
they O
telling O
the O
truth O
? O
'' O

But O
Jesus O
said O
nothing O
. O

Again O
the O
high O
priest O
said O
to O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
You O
are O
now O
under O
oath O
. O

I O
command O
you O
by O
the O
power O
of O
the O
living O
God O
to O
tell O
us O
the O
truth O
. O

Tell O
us O
, O
are O
you O
the O
Christ O
, O
the O
Son O
of O
God O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
that O
's O
right O
. O

But O
I O
tell O
you O
, O
in O
the O
future O
you O
will O
see O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O
sitting O
at O
the O
right O
side O
of O
God O
. O

And O
you O
will O
see O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O
coming O
on O
the O
clouds O
of O
heaven O
. O
'' O

When O
the O
high O
priest O
heard O
this O
, O
he O
tore O
his O
clothes O
in O
anger O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
This O
man O
has O
said O
things O
that O
insult O
God O
! O

We O
do O
n't O
need O
any O
more O
witnesses O
. O

You O
all O
heard O
his O
insulting O
words O
. O

What O
do O
you O
think O
? O
'' O

The O
Jewish O
leaders O
answered O
, O
`` O
He O
is O
guilty O
, O
and O
he O
must O
die O
. O
'' O

Then O
some O
there O
spit O
in O
Jesus O
' O
face O
, O
and O
they O
hit O
him O
with O
their O
fists O
. O

Others O
slapped O
him O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Show O
us O
that O
you O
are O
a O
prophet O
, O
Christ O
! O

Tell O
us O
who O
hit O
you O
! O
'' O

While O
Peter O
was O
sitting O
outside O
in O
the O
yard O
, O
a O
servant O
girl O
came O
up O
to O
him O
. O

She O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
were O
with O
Jesus O
, O
that O
man O
from O
Galilee O
. O
'' O

But O
Peter O
told O
everyone O
there O
that O
this O
was O
not O
true O
. O

`` O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
you O
are O
talking O
about O
, O
'' O
he O
said O
. O

Then O
he O
left O
the O
yard O
. O

At O
the O
gate O
another O
girl O
saw O
him O
and O
said O
to O
the O
people O
there O
, O
`` O

This O
man O
was O
with O
Jesus O
of O
Nazareth O
. O
'' O

Again O
, O
Peter O
said O
he O
was O
never O
with O
Jesus O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
swear O
to O
God O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
the O
man O
! O
'' O

A O
short O
time O
later O
those O
standing O
there O
went O
to O
Peter O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
We O
know O
you O
are O
one O
of O
them O
. O

It O
's O
clear O
from O
the O
way O
you O
talk O
. O
'' O

Then O
Peter O
began O
to O
curse O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
swear O
to O
God O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
the O
man O
! O
'' O

As O
soon O
as O
he O
said O
this O
, O
a O
rooster O
crowed O
. O

Then O
he O
remembered O
what O
Jesus O
had O
told O
him O
: O
`` O

Before O
the O
rooster O
crows O
, O
you O
will O
say O
three O
times O
that O
you O
do O
n't O
know O
me O
. O
'' O

Then O
Peter O
went O
outside O
and O
cried O
bitterly O
. O

Jesus O
and O
his O
followers O
were O
coming O
closer O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

But O
first O
they O
stopped O
at O
Bethphage O
at O
the O
hill O
called O
the O
Mount O
of O
Olives O
. O

From O
there O
Jesus O
sent O
two O
of O
his O
followers O
into O
town O
. O

He O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Go O
to O
the O
town O
you O
can O
see O
there O
. O

When O
you O
enter O
it O
, O
you O
will O
find O
a O
donkey O
with O
her O
colt O
. O

Untie O
them O
both O
, O
and O
bring O
them O
to O
me O
. O

If O
anyone O
asks O
you O
why O
you O
are O
taking O
the O
donkeys O
, O
tell O
them O
, O
' O
The O
Master O
needs O
them O
. O

He O
will O
send O
them O
back O
soon O
. O
' O
'' O

This O
showed O
the O
full O
meaning O
of O
what O
the O
prophet O
said O
: O
`` O
Tell O
the O
people O
of O
Zion O
, O
' O
Now O
your O
king O
is O
coming O
to O
you O
. O

He O
is O
humble O
and O
riding O
on O
a O
donkey O
. O

He O
is O
riding O
on O
a O
young O
donkey O
, O
born O
from O
a O
work O
animal O
. O
' O
'' O

The O
followers O
went O
and O
did O
what O
Jesus O
told O
them O
to O
do O
. O

They O
brought O
the O
mother O
donkey O
and O
the O
young O
donkey O
to O
him O
. O

They O
covered O
the O
donkeys O
with O
their O
coats O
, O
and O
Jesus O
sat O
on O
them O
. O

On O
the O
way O
to O
Jerusalem O
many O
people O
spread O
their O
coats O
on O
the O
road O
for O
Jesus O
. O

Others O
cut O
branches O
from O
the O
trees O
and O
spread O
them O
on O
the O
road O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
people O
were O
walking O
ahead O
of O
Jesus O
. O

Others O
were O
walking O
behind O
him O
. O

They O
all O
shouted O
, O
`` O
Praise O
to O
the O
Son O
of O
David O
! O
' O

Welcome O
! O

God O
bless O
the O
one O
who O
comes O
in O
the O
name O
of O
the O
Lord O
! O
' O

Praise O
to O
God O
in O
heaven O
! O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
went O
into O
Jerusalem O
. O

All O
the O
people O
in O
the O
city O
were O
confused O
. O

They O
asked O
, O
`` O
Who O
is O
this O
man O
? O
'' O

The O
crowds O
following O
Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
This O
is O
Jesus O
. O

He O
is O
the O
prophet O
from O
the O
town O
of O
Nazareth O
in O
Galilee O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
went O
into O
the O
Temple O
area O
. O

He O
threw O
out O
all O
those O
who O
were O
selling O
and O
buying O
things O
there O
. O

He O
turned O
over O
the O
tables O
that O
belonged O
to O
those O
who O
were O
exchanging O
different O
kinds O
of O
money O
. O

And O
he O
turned O
over O
the O
benches O
of O
those O
who O
were O
selling O
doves O
. O

Jesus O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
The O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
' O
My O
Temple O
will O
be O
called O
a O
house O
of O
prayer O
. O
' O

But O
you O
are O
changing O
it O
into O
a O
' O
hiding O
place O
for O
thieves O
. O
' O
'' O

Some O
blind O
people O
and O
some O
who O
were O
crippled O
came O
to O
Jesus O
in O
the O
Temple O
area O
. O

Jesus O
healed O
them O
. O

The O
leading O
priests O
and O
the O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
saw O
the O
wonderful O
things O
he O
was O
doing O
. O

And O
they O
saw O
the O
children O
praising O
him O
in O
the O
Temple O
area O
. O

The O
children O
were O
shouting O
, O
`` O
Praise O
to O
the O
Son O
of O
David O
. O
'' O

All O
this O
made O
the O
priests O
and O
the O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
angry O
. O

They O
asked O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
Do O
you O
hear O
what O
these O
children O
are O
saying O
? O
'' O

He O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O
. O

The O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
' O
You O
have O
taught O
children O
and O
babies O
to O
give O
praise O
. O
' O

Have O
you O
not O
read O
that O
Scripture O
? O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
left O
them O
and O
went O
out O
of O
the O
city O
to O
Bethany O
, O
where O
he O
spent O
the O
night O
. O

Early O
the O
next O
morning O
, O
Jesus O
was O
going O
back O
to O
the O
city O
. O

He O
was O
very O
hungry O
. O

He O
saw O
a O
fig O
tree O
beside O
the O
road O
and O
went O
to O
get O
a O
fig O
from O
it O
. O

But O
there O
were O
no O
figs O
on O
the O
tree O
. O

There O
were O
only O
leaves O
. O

So O
Jesus O
said O
to O
the O
tree O
, O
`` O
You O
will O
never O
again O
produce O
fruit O
! O
'' O

The O
tree O
immediately O
dried O
up O
and O
died O
. O

When O
the O
followers O
saw O
this O
, O
they O
were O
very O
surprised O
. O

They O
asked O
, O
`` O
How O
did O
the O
fig O
tree O
dry O
up O
and O
die O
so O
quickly O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
The O
truth O
is O
, O
if O
you O
have O
faith O
and O
no O
doubts O

you O
will O

do O

you O

And O
if O

it O

If O

you O
will O
get O
anything O

Jesus O
went O
into O
the O
Temple O
area O

While O
Jesus O
was O
teaching O
there O
, O
the O
leading O
priests O
and O
the O
older O
leaders O
of O
the O
people O
came O
to O
him O

said O

: O
When O
John O
baptized O

did O
his O

was O
it O
only O
from O

The O
priests O

the O
Jewish O
leaders O
talked O
about O

They O
said O
to O
each O

`` O

But O
we O

are O
afraid O
of O
the O
people O

they O
all O
believe O

a O
prophet O

So O
they O
told O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
We O
do O

Jesus O
said O

`` O

You O
saw O
that O
happening O

but O
you O
would O
not O
change O

You O
still O
refused O
to O
believe O
him O

`` O
Listen O
to O
this O
story O
: O
There O
was O
a O
man O
who O
owned O
a O
vineyard O
. O

He O
put O
a O
wall O
around O
the O
field O
and O
dug O
a O
hole O
for O
a O
winepress O
. O

Then O
he O
built O
a O
tower O
. O

He O
leased O
the O
land O
to O
some O
farmers O
and O
then O
left O
on O
a O
trip O
. O

Later O
, O
it O
was O
time O
for O
the O
grapes O
to O
be O
picked O
. O

So O
the O
man O
sent O
his O
servants O
to O
the O
farmers O
to O
get O
his O
share O
of O
the O
grapes O
. O

`` O
But O
the O
farmers O
grabbed O
the O
servants O
and O
beat O
one O
. O

They O
killed O
another O
one O
and O
then O
stoned O
to O
death O
a O
third O
servant O
. O

So O
the O
man O
sent O
some O
other O
servants O
to O
the O
farmers O
. O

He O
sent O
more O
servants O
than O
he O
sent O
the O
first O
time O
. O

But O
the O
farmers O
did O
the O
same O
thing O
to O
them O
that O
they O
did O
the O
first O
time O
. O

So O
the O
man O
decided O
to O
send O
his O
son O
to O
the O
farmers O
. O

He O
said O
, O
' O
The O
farmers O
will O
respect O
my O
son O
. O
' O

`` O
But O
when O
the O
farmers O
saw O
the O
son O
, O
they O
said O
to O
each O
other O
, O
' O
This O
is O
the O
owner O
's O
son O
. O

This O
vineyard O
will O
be O
his O
. O

If O
we O
kill O
him O
, O
it O
will O
be O
ours O
. O
' O

So O
the O
farmers O
took O
the O
son O
, O
threw O
him O
out O
of O
the O
vineyard O
, O
and O
killed O
him O
. O

`` O
So O
what O
will O
the O
owner O
of O
the O
vineyard O
do O
to O
these O
farmers O
when O
he O
comes O
? O
'' O

The O
Jewish O
priests O
and O
leaders O
said O
, O
`` O
He O
will O
surely O
kill O
those O
evil O
men O
. O

Then O
he O
will O
lease O
the O
land O
to O
other O
farmers O
, O
who O
will O
give O
him O
his O
share O
of O
the O
crop O
at O
harvest O
time O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Surely O
you O
have O
read O
this O
in O
the O
Scriptures O
: O
' O
The O
stone O
that O
the O
builders O
refused O
to O
accept O
became O
the O
cornerstone O

The O
Lord O
did O
this O
, O
and O
it O
is O
wonderful O
to O
us O

`` O
So O
I O
tell O
you O
that O
God O

kingdom O
will O
be O
taken O
away O

It O
will O

given O
to O

do O
what O
God O
wants O
in O

broken O

it O

All O
this O
happened O
to O
make O
clear O
the O
full O

of O
what O
the O
Lord O
said O
through O
the O
prophet O
: O
`` O
The O
virgin O
will O
be O

When O

did O
what O

He O

he O

The O

came O
to O

They O
wanted O
to O
test O
him O

So O
they O
asked O
him O
to O
show O
them O
a O
miracle O
as O
a O
sign O
from O
God O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
When O
you O
people O
see O
the O
sunset O
, O
you O
know O
what O
the O
weather O
will O
be O

If O
the O
sky O
is O

you O
say O
we O
will O
have O
good O
weather O

And O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
if O
the O
sky O
is O
dark O
and O
red O
, O
you O
say O
that O
it O
will O
be O
a O
rainy O
day O

These O
are O
signs O
of O
the O
weather O

You O
see O
these O
signs O
in O
the O
sky O
and O
know O
what O
they O
mean O

In O
the O
same O
way O
, O
you O
see O
the O
things O
that O
are O
happening O
now O

These O
are O
also O
signs O
, O
but O
you O
do O
n't O
know O
their O
meaning O

It O
is O
the O
evil O
and O
sinful O
people O
who O
want O
to O
see O
a O
miracle O
as O
a O
sign O
from O
God O

But O
no O
miracle O
will O
be O
done O
to O
prove O
anything O
to O
them O
. O

The O
only O
sign O
will O
be O
the O
miracle O
that O
happened O
to O
Jonah O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
went O
away O
from O
there O
. O

Jesus O
and O
his O
followers O
went O
across O
the O
lake O
. O

But O
the O
followers O
forgot O
to O
bring O
bread O
. O

Jesus O
said O
to O
the O
followers O
, O
`` O
Be O
careful O
! O

Guard O
against O
the O
yeast O
of O
the O
Pharisees O
and O
the O
Sadducees O
. O
'' O

The O
followers O
discussed O
the O
meaning O
of O
this O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Did O
Jesus O
say O
this O
because O
we O
forgot O
to O
bring O
bread O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
knew O
that O
they O
were O
talking O
about O
this O
. O

So O
he O
asked O
them O
, O
`` O
Why O
are O
you O
talking O
about O
not O
having O
bread O
? O

Your O
faith O
is O
small O

Do O
you O
still O
not O
understand O
? O

Remember O
the O
five O
loaves O
of O
bread O
that O
fed O
the O
5000 O
people O
and O
the O
many O
baskets O
you O
filled O
with O
the O
bread O
that O
was O
left O
? O

And O
remember O
the O
seven O
loaves O
of O
bread O
that O
fed O
the O
4000 O
people O
and O
the O
many O
baskets O
you O
filled O
that O
time O
? O

So O
how O
could O
you O
think O
that O
I O
am O
concerned O
about O
bread O
? O

I O
am O
telling O
you O
to O
be O
careful O
and O
guard O
against O
the O
yeast O
of O
the O
Pharisees O
and O
the O
Sadducees O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
followers O
understood O
what O
Jesus O
meant O
. O

He O
was O
not O
telling O
them O
to O
guard O
against O
the O
yeast O
used O
in O
bread O
. O

He O
was O
telling O
them O
to O
guard O
against O
the O
teaching O
of O
the O
Pharisees O

the O
Sadducees O

Jesus O
went O
to O
the O
area O
of O
Caesarea O

He O
said O
to O
his O
followers O
, O
`` O
Who O
do O

They O
answered O

`` O
Some O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
to O
his O
followers O
, O
`` O
And O
who O
do O
you O
say O
I O
am O

Simon O
Peter O
answered O
, O
`` O
You O
are O
the O
Christ O

the O
Son O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O

Simon O
son O
of O

No O
one O
taught O
you O
that O

showed O
you O
who O
I O

So O
I O
tell O
you O

you O
are O
Peter O

And O
I O
will O
build O
my O
church O
on O
this O
rock O

The O
power O

not O

to O
defeat O
my O

I O
will O
give O
you O
the O
keys O
to O
God O

When O
you O
speak O
judgment O
here O
on O

that O
judgment O
will O

promise O
forgiveness O
here O

that O

Then O
Jesus O
warned O
his O
followers O
not O
to O
tell O
anyone O
he O
was O
the O
Christ O

> O
From O
that O
time O
Jesus O
began O
telling O
his O
followers O
that O
he O
must O
go O
to O
Jerusalem O

He O
explained O
that O
the O
older O
Jewish O
leaders O
, O
the O
leading O
priests O
, O
and O
the O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
would O
make O
him O
suffer O
many O
things O

And O
he O
told O
his O

that O
he O
must O
be O
killed O

Then O
, O
on O
the O
third O
day O
, O
he O
would O
be O
raised O
from O

Peter O
took O
Jesus O
away O
from O
the O
other O
followers O
to O
talk O
to O
him O
alone O

He O
began O
to O
criticize O
him O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
God O
save O
you O
from O
those O
sufferings O

That O

`` O
Get O

He O
asked O

They O
answered O

`` O
In O

Then O
Herod O

a O
private O

first O
saw O
the O

Then O
he O
sent O
them O
to O

I O

After O
the O
wise O
men O
heard O
the O
king O

they O
left O

They O
saw O
the O
same O
star O
they O
had O
seen O
in O
the O
east O
, O
and O
they O
followed O
it O
. O

The O
star O
went O
before O
them O
until O
it O
stopped O
above O
the O
place O
where O
the O
child O
was O
. O

They O
were O
very O
happy O
and O
excited O
to O
see O
the O
star O

The O
wise O
men O
came O
to O
the O
house O
where O
the O
child O
was O
with O
his O
mother O
Mary O

They O
bowed O
down O

worshiped O
him O

Then O
they O
opened O
the O
boxes O
of O
gifts O
they O
had O
brought O
for O
him O

They O
gave O
him O
treasures O
of O
gold O

frankincense O

myrrh O

But O
God O
warned O
the O
wise O
men O
in O
a O
dream O
not O
to O
go O
back O
to O
Herod O

So O
they O
went O
home O
to O
their O
own O
country O
a O
different O
way O

After O
the O
wise O
men O
left O
, O
an O
angel O
from O
the O
Lord O
came O
to O
Joseph O
in O
a O
dream O
. O

The O
angel O
said O
, O
`` O
Get O
up O
! O

Take O
the O
child O
with O
his O
mother O
and O
escape O
to O
Egypt O

Herod O
wants O
to O
kill O
the O
child O
and O
will O
soon O
start O
looking O
for O
him O
. O

Stay O
in O
Egypt O
until O
I O
tell O
you O
to O
come O
back O

So O
Joseph O
got O
ready O
and O
left O
for O
Egypt O
with O
the O
child O

the O
mother O

They O
left O
during O
the O
night O

Joseph O
stayed O
in O
Egypt O
until O
Herod O

This O
gave O
full O

what O
the O
Lord O
said O

: O
`` O

I O
called O

out O

Herod O
saw O
that O

had O
fooled O
him O

he O
was O
very O
angry O

So O
he O
gave O
an O
order O

kill O
all O
the O
baby O

in O
Bethlehem O

the O
whole O
area O
around O
Bethlehem O

Herod O
had O
learned O
from O

time O
the O
baby O
was O
born O

It O
was O
now O
two O
years O

said O

kill O
all O

were O
two O

: O
`` O
A O
sound O
was O
heard O
in O
Ramah O
-- O
bitter O
crying O
and O
great O
sadness O
. O

Rachel O
cries O
for O
her O
children O
, O
and O
she O
can O
not O
be O
comforted O
, O
because O
her O
children O
are O
gone O
. O
'' O

While O
Joseph O
was O
in O
Egypt O
, O
Herod O
died O
. O

An O
angel O
from O
the O
Lord O
came O
to O
Joseph O
in O
a O
dream O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Get O
up O
! O

Take O
the O
child O
with O
his O
mother O
and O
go O
to O
Israel O
. O

Those O
who O
were O
trying O
to O
kill O
the O
child O
are O
now O
dead O
. O
'' O

So O
Joseph O
took O
the O
child O
and O
the O
mother O
and O
went O
to O
Israel O
. O

But O
he O
heard O
that O
Archelaus O
was O
now O
king O
in O
Judea O
. O

Archelaus O
became O
king O
when O
his O
father O
Herod O
died O
. O

So O
Joseph O
was O
afraid O
to O
go O
there O
. O

Then O
, O
after O
being O
warned O
in O
a O
dream O
, O
he O
went O
away O
to O
the O
area O
of O
Galilee O
. O

He O
went O
to O
a O
town O
called O
Nazareth O
and O
lived O
there O
. O

This O
gave O
full O
meaning O
to O
what O
God O
said O
through O
the O
prophets O
. O

God O
said O
the O
Christ O
would O
be O
called O
a O
Nazarene O
. O

That O
same O
day O
Jesus O
went O
out O
of O
the O
house O
and O
sat O
by O
the O
lake O
. O

A O
large O
crowd O
gathered O
around O
him O
. O

So O
he O
got O
into O
a O
boat O
and O
sat O
down O
. O

All O
the O
people O
stayed O
on O
the O
shore O
. O

Then O
Jesus O
used O
stories O
to O
teach O
them O
many O
things O
. O

He O
told O
them O
this O
story O
: O
`` O
A O
farmer O
went O
out O
to O
sow O
seed O
. O

While O
he O
was O
scattering O
the O
seed O
, O
some O
of O
it O
fell O
by O
the O
road O
. O

The O
birds O
came O
and O
ate O
all O
that O
seed O
. O

Other O
seed O
fell O
on O
rocky O
ground O
, O
where O
there O
was O
not O
enough O
dirt O
. O

It O
grew O
very O
fast O
there O
, O
because O
the O
soil O
was O
not O
deep O
. O

But O
when O
the O
sun O
rose O
, O
it O
burned O
the O
plants O
. O

The O
plants O
died O
because O
they O
did O
not O
have O
deep O
roots O
. O

Some O
other O
seed O
fell O
among O
thorny O
weeds O
. O

The O
weeds O
grew O
and O
stopped O
the O
good O
plants O
from O
growing O
. O

But O
some O
of O
the O
seed O
fell O
on O
good O
ground O
. O

There O
it O
grew O
and O
made O
grain O
. O

Some O
plants O
made O
100 O
times O
more O
grain O
, O
some O
60 O
times O
more O
, O
and O
some O
30 O
times O
more O
. O

You O
people O
who O
hear O
me O
, O
listen O
! O
'' O

The O
followers O
came O
to O
Jesus O
and O
asked O
, O
`` O
Why O
do O
you O
use O
these O
stories O
to O
teach O
the O
people O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
Only O
you O
can O
know O
the O
secret O
truths O
about O
God O
's O
kingdom O
. O

Those O
other O
people O
can O
not O
know O
these O
secret O
truths O
. O

The O
people O
who O
have O
some O
understanding O
will O
be O
given O
more O
. O

And O
they O
will O
have O
even O
more O
than O
they O
need O
. O

But O
those O
who O
do O
not O
have O
much O
understanding O
will O
lose O
even O
the O
little O
understanding O
that O
they O
have O
. O

This O
is O
why O
I O
use O
these O
stories O
to O
teach O
the O
people O
: O
They O
see O
, O
but O
they O
do O
n't O
really O
see O
. O

They O
hear O
, O
but O
they O
do O
n't O
really O
hear O
or O
understand O
. O

So O
they O
show O
that O
what O
Isaiah O
said O
about O
them O
is O
true O
: O
' O
You O
people O
will O
listen O
and O
listen O
, O
but O
you O
will O
not O
understand O
. O

You O
will O
look O
and O
look O
, O
but O
you O
will O
not O
really O
see O
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
minds O
of O
these O
people O
are O
now O
closed O
. O

They O
have O
ears O
, O
but O
they O
do O
n't O
listen O
. O

They O
have O
eyes O
, O
but O
they O
refuse O
to O
see O
. O

If O
their O
minds O
were O
not O
closed O
, O
they O
might O
see O
with O
their O
eyes O
; O
they O
might O
hear O
with O
their O
ears O
; O
they O
might O
understand O
with O
their O
minds O
. O

Then O
they O
might O
turn O
back O
to O
me O
and O
be O
healed O
. O
' O

But O
God O
has O
blessed O
you O
. O

You O
understand O
what O
you O
see O
with O
your O
eyes O
. O

And O
you O
understand O
what O
you O
hear O
with O
your O
ears O
. O

I O
can O
assure O
you O
, O
many O
prophets O
and O
godly O
people O
wanted O
to O
see O
what O
you O
now O
see O
. O

But O
they O
did O
not O
see O
it O
. O

And O
many O
prophets O
and O
godly O
people O
wanted O
to O
hear O
what O
you O
now O
hear O
. O

But O
they O
did O
not O
hear O
it O
. O

`` O
So O
listen O
to O
the O
meaning O
of O
that O
story O
about O
the O
farmer O
: O
`` O
What O
about O
the O
seed O
that O
fell O
by O
the O
path O
? O

That O
is O
like O
the O
people O
who O
hear O
the O
teaching O
about O
God O
's O
kingdom O
but O
do O
not O
understand O
it O
. O

The O
Evil O
One O
comes O
and O
takes O
away O
what O
was O
planted O
in O
their O
hearts O
. O

`` O
And O
what O
about O
the O
seed O
that O
fell O
on O
rocky O
ground O
? O

That O
is O
like O
the O
people O
who O
hear O
the O
teaching O
and O
quickly O
and O
gladly O
accept O
it O
. O

But O
they O
do O
not O
let O
the O
teaching O
go O
deep O
into O
their O
lives O
. O

They O
keep O
it O
only O
a O
short O
time O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
trouble O
or O
persecution O
comes O
because O
of O
the O
teaching O
they O
accepted O
, O
they O
give O
up O
. O

`` O
And O
what O
about O
the O
seed O
that O
fell O
among O
the O
thorny O
weeds O
? O

That O
is O
like O
the O
people O
who O
hear O
the O
teaching O
but O
let O
worries O
about O
this O
life O
and O
love O
for O
money O
stop O
it O
from O
growing O
. O

So O
it O
does O
not O
produce O
a O
crop O
in O
their O
lives O
. O

`` O
But O
what O
about O
the O
seed O
that O
fell O
on O
the O
good O
ground O
? O

That O
is O
like O
the O
people O
who O
hear O
the O
teaching O
and O
understand O
it O
. O

They O
grow O
and O
produce O
a O
good O
crop O
, O
sometimes O
100 O
times O
more O
, O
sometimes O
60 O
times O
more O
, O
and O
sometimes O
30 O
times O
more O

Then O
Jesus O
used O
another O
story O
to O
teach O
them O
. O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
God O
's O
kingdom O

like O
a O

That O
night O
, O
while O
everyone O
was O
asleep O
, O
the O
man O
's O
enemy O
came O
and O
planted O
weeds O
among O
the O
wheat O
and O
then O
left O

Later O
, O
the O
wheat O
grew O
, O
and O
heads O
of O
grain O
grew O
on O
the O
plants O

But O
at O
the O
same O
time O
the O
weeds O
also O
grew O
. O

Then O
the O
man O
's O
servants O
came O
to O
him O
and O
said O
, O
' O
You O
planted O
good O
seed O
in O
your O
field O

Where O
did O
the O

come O
from O

`` O
The O

`` O
The O

up O

`` O
He O
answered O
, O
' O
No O

because O
when O
you O
pull O
up O

you O
might O
also O

Let O
the O
weeds O

the O
wheat O
grow O
together O
until O
the O
harvest O
time O

At O
the O
harvest O
time O
I O
will O
tell O
the O
workers O
this O
: O
First O
, O
gather O
the O
weeds O

tie O
them O
together O

Then O
gather O
the O

bring O
it O
to O
my O
barn O

Then O
Jesus O
told O
the O
people O
another O
story O
: O
`` O
God O

like O
a O
mustard O

is O

But O
when O
it O
grows O
, O
it O
is O
the O
largest O
of O

It O
becomes O
a O

enough O
for O

make O
nests O

its O
branches O

Then O
Jesus O
told O
them O
another O
story O
: O

The O
yeast O
makes O

'' O

Jesus O
used O
stories O
to O
tell O
all O
these O
things O
to O
the O
people O

He O
always O
used O
stories O
to O
teach O

was O
to O
make O
clear O

Jesus O
left O

So O
every O

When O
Jesus O

he O
left O
there O

went O

the O
town O

up O

He O
taught O
the O
people O

the O
synagogue O

they O
were O
amazed O

said O

`` O

did O
this O

get O
such O

this O

they O
had O
a O
problem O
accepting O
him O

Jesus O
said O
to O

any O
honor O

Jesus O
did O
not O
do O
many O
miracles O
there O

because O
the O

not O

Then O
some O
Pharisees O

of O
the O

came O

came O

asked O
him O

bad O
to O
their O
father O
or O
mother O
must O
be O
killed O
. O
' O

But O
you O
teach O
that O
a O
person O
can O
say O
to O
their O
father O
or O
mother O
, O
' O
I O
have O
something O
I O
could O
use O
to O
help O
you O
. O

But O
I O
will O
not O
use O
it O
for O
you O
. O

I O
will O
give O
it O
to O
God O
. O
' O

You O
are O
teaching O
them O
not O
to O
respect O
their O
father O
. O

So O
you O
are O
teaching O
that O
it O
is O
not O
important O
to O
do O
what O
God O
said O
. O

You O
think O
it O
is O
more O
important O
to O
follow O
those O
traditions O
you O
have O
. O

You O
are O
hypocrites O
! O

Isaiah O
was O
right O
when O
he O
spoke O
for O
God O
about O
you O
: O
' O
These O
people O
honor O
me O
with O
their O
words O
, O
but O
I O
am O
not O
really O
important O
to O
them O
. O

Their O
worship O
of O
me O
is O
worthless O
. O

The O
things O
they O
teach O
are O
only O
human O
rules O
. O
' O
'' O

Jesus O
called O
the O
people O
to O
him O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Listen O
and O
understand O
what O
I O
am O
saying O
. O

It O
is O
not O
what O
people O
put O
in O
their O
mouth O
that O
makes O
them O
wrong O
. O

It O
is O
what O
comes O
out O
of O
their O
mouth O
that O
makes O
them O
wrong O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
followers O
came O
to O
Jesus O
and O
asked O
, O
`` O
Do O
you O
know O
that O
the O
Pharisees O
are O
upset O
about O
what O
you O
said O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
Every O
plant O
that O
my O
Father O
in O
heaven O
has O
not O
planted O
will O
be O
pulled O
up O
by O
the O
roots O
. O

Stay O
away O
from O
the O
Pharisees O
. O

They O
lead O
the O
people O
, O
but O
they O
are O
like O
blind O
men O
leading O
other O
blind O
men O
. O

And O
if O
a O
blind O
man O
leads O
another O
blind O
man O
, O
both O
of O
them O
will O
fall O
into O
a O
ditch O
. O
'' O

Peter O
said O
, O
`` O
Explain O
to O
us O
what O
you O
said O
earlier O
to O
the O
people O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Do O
you O
still O
have O
trouble O
understanding O
? O

Surely O
you O
know O
that O
all O
the O
food O
that O
enters O
the O
mouth O
goes O
into O
the O
stomach O
. O

Then O
it O
goes O
out O
of O
the O
body O
. O

But O
the O
bad O
things O
people O
say O
with O
their O
mouth O
come O
from O
the O
way O
they O
think O
. O

And O
that O
's O
what O
can O
make O
people O
wrong O
. O

All O
these O
bad O
things O
begin O
in O
the O
mind O
: O
evil O
thoughts O
, O
murder O
, O
adultery O
, O
sexual O
sins O
, O
stealing O
, O
lying O
, O
and O
insulting O
people O
. O

These O
are O
the O
things O
that O
make O
people O
wrong O
. O

Eating O
without O
washing O
their O
hands O
will O
never O
make O
people O
unacceptable O
to O
God O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
went O
from O
there O
to O
the O
area O
of O
Tyre O
and O
Sidon O
. O

A O
Canaanite O
woman O
from O
that O
area O
came O
out O
and O
began O
shouting O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
Son O
of O
David O
, O
please O
help O
me O
! O

My O
daughter O
has O
a O
demon O
inside O
her O
, O
and O
she O
is O
suffering O
very O
much O
. O
'' O

But O
Jesus O
did O
not O
answer O
her O
. O

So O
the O
followers O
came O
to O
him O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Tell O
her O
to O
go O
away O
. O

She O
keeps O
crying O
out O
and O
will O
not O
leave O
us O
alone O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
God O
sent O
me O
only O
to O
the O
lost O
people O
of O
Israel O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
woman O
came O
over O
to O
Jesus O
and O
bowed O
before O
him O
. O

She O
said O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
help O
me O
! O
'' O

He O
answered O
her O
with O
this O
saying O
: O
`` O
It O
is O
not O
right O
to O
take O
the O
children O
's O
bread O
and O
give O
it O
to O
the O
dogs O
. O
'' O

The O
woman O
said O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
Lord O
, O
but O
even O
the O
dogs O
eat O
the O
pieces O
of O
food O
that O
fall O
from O
their O
master O
's O
table O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
Woman O
, O
you O
have O
great O
faith O
! O

You O
will O
get O
what O
you O
asked O
for O
. O
'' O

And O
right O
then O
the O
woman O
's O
daughter O
was O
healed O
. O

Then O
Jesus O
went O
from O
there O
to O
the O
shore O
of O
Lake O
Galilee O
. O

He O
went O
up O
on O
a O
hill O
and O
sat O
down O
. O

A O
large O
crowd O
of O
people O
came O
to O
him O
. O

They O
brought O
many O
other O
sick O
people O
and O
put O
them O
before O
him O
. O

There O
were O
people O
who O
could O
not O
walk O
, O
people O
who O
were O
blind O
, O
crippled O
, O
or O
deaf O
, O
and O
many O
others O
. O

Jesus O
healed O
them O
all O
. O

People O
were O
amazed O
when O
they O
saw O
that O
those O
who O
could O
not O
speak O
were O
now O
able O
to O
speak O
. O

Crippled O
people O
were O
made O
strong O
. O

Those O
who O
could O
not O
walk O
were O
now O
able O
to O
walk O
. O

The O
blind O
were O
able O
to O
see O
. O

Everyone O
thanked O
the O
God O
of O
Israel O
for O
this O
. O

Jesus O
called O
his O
followers O
to O
him O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
feel O
sorry O
for O
these O
people O
. O

They O
have O
been O
with O
me O
three O
days O
, O
and O
now O
they O
have O
nothing O
to O
eat O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
send O
them O
away O
hungry O
. O

They O
might O
faint O
while O
going O
home O
. O
'' O

The O
followers O
asked O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
Where O
can O
we O
get O
enough O
bread O
to O
feed O
all O
these O
people O
? O

We O
are O
a O
long O
way O
from O
any O
town O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
asked O
, O
`` O
How O
many O
loaves O
of O
bread O
do O
you O
have O
? O
'' O

They O
answered O
, O
`` O
We O
have O
seven O
loaves O
of O
bread O
and O
a O
few O
small O
fish O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
told O
the O
people O
to O
sit O
on O
the O
ground O
. O

He O
took O
the O
seven O
loaves O
of O
bread O
and O
the O
fish O
. O

Then O
he O
gave O
thanks O
to O
God O
for O
the O
food O
. O

He O
broke O
the O
bread O
into O
pieces O
, O
which O
he O
gave O
to O
the O
followers O
, O
and O
they O
gave O
the O
food O
to O
the O
people O
. O

All O
the O
people O
ate O
until O
they O
were O
full O
. O

After O
this O
, O
the O
followers O
filled O
seven O
baskets O
with O
the O
pieces O
of O
food O
that O
were O
not O
eaten O
. O

There O
were O
about O
4000 O
men O
there O
who O
ate O
. O

There O
were O
also O
some O
women O
and O
children O
. O

After O
they O
all O
ate O
, O
Jesus O
told O
the O
people O
they O
could O
go O
home O
. O

He O
got O
into O
the O
boat O
and O
went O
to O
the O
area O
of O
Magadan O
. O

Then O
the O
Spirit O
led O
Jesus O
into O
the O
desert O
. O

He O
was O
taken O
there O
to O
be O
tempted O
by O
the O
devil O
. O

Jesus O
ate O
nothing O
for O
40 O
days O
and O
nights O
. O

After O
this O
, O
he O
was O
very O
hungry O
. O

The O
devil O
came O
to O
tempt O
him O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
If O
you O
are O
the O
Son O
of O
God O
, O
tell O
these O
rocks O
to O
become O
bread O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
him O
, O
`` O
The O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
' O
It O
is O
not O
just O
bread O
that O
keeps O
people O
alive O
. O

Their O
lives O
depend O
on O
what O
God O
says O
. O
' O
'' O
Then O
the O
devil O
led O
Jesus O
to O
the O
holy O
city O
of O
Jerusalem O
and O
put O
him O
on O
a O
high O
place O
at O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
Temple O
area O
. O

He O
said O
to O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
If O
you O
are O
the O
Son O
of O
God O
, O
jump O
off O
, O
because O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
' O
God O
will O
command O
his O
angels O
to O
help O
you O
, O
and O
their O
hands O
will O
catch O
you O
, O
so O
that O
you O
will O
not O
hit O
your O
foot O
on O
a O
rock O
. O
' O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
The O
Scriptures O
also O
say O
, O
' O
You O
must O
not O
test O
the O
Lord O
your O
God O
. O
' O
'' O

Then O
the O
devil O
led O
Jesus O
to O
the O
top O
of O
a O
very O
high O
mountain O
and O
showed O
him O
all O
the O
kingdoms O
of O
the O
world O
and O
all O
the O
wonderful O
things O
in O
them O
. O

The O
devil O
said O
, O
`` O
If O
you O
will O
bow O
down O
and O
worship O
me O
, O
I O
will O
give O
you O
all O
these O
things O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Get O
away O
from O
me O
, O
Satan O
! O

The O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
' O
You O
must O
worship O
the O
Lord O
your O
God O
. O

Serve O
only O
him O
! O
' O
'' O

So O
the O
devil O
left O
him O
. O

Then O
some O
angels O
came O
to O
Jesus O
and O
helped O
him O
. O

Jesus O
heard O
that O
John O
was O
put O
in O
prison O
, O
so O
he O
went O
back O
to O
Galilee O
. O

But O
he O
did O
not O
stay O
in O
Nazareth O
. O

He O
went O
to O
live O
in O
Capernaum O
, O
a O
town O
near O
Lake O
Galilee O
in O
the O
area O
near O
Zebulun O
and O
Naphtali O
. O

He O
did O
this O
to O
give O
full O
meaning O
to O
what O
the O
prophet O
Isaiah O
said O
: O
`` O
Listen O
, O
land O
of O
Zebulun O
and O
land O
of O
Naphtali O
, O
lands O
by O
the O
road O
that O
goes O
to O
the O
sea O
, O
the O
area O
past O
the O
Jordan O
River O
-- O
Galilee O
, O
where O
those O
from O
other O
nations O
live O
. O

The O
people O
who O
live O
in O
spiritual O
darkness O
have O
seen O
a O
great O
light O
. O

The O
light O
has O
shined O
for O
those O
who O
live O
in O
the O
land O
that O
is O
as O
dark O
as O
a O
grave O
. O
'' O

> O
From O
that O
time O
Jesus O
began O
to O
tell O
people O
his O
message O
: O
`` O
Change O
your O
hearts O
and O
lives O
, O
because O
God O
's O
kingdom O
is O
coming O
soon O
. O
'' O

As O
Jesus O
was O
walking O
by O
Lake O
Galilee O
, O
he O
saw O
two O
brothers O
, O
Simon O
-LRB- O
called O
Peter O
-RRB- O
and O
Simon O
's O
brother O
Andrew O
. O

These O
brothers O
were O
fishermen O
, O
and O
they O
were O
fishing O
in O
the O
lake O
with O
a O
net O
. O

Jesus O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Come O
, O
follow O
me O
, O
and O
I O
will O
make O
you O
a O
different O
kind O
of O
fishermen O
. O

You O
will O
bring O
in O
people O
, O
not O
fish O
. O
'' O

Simon O
and O
Andrew O
immediately O
left O
their O
nets O
and O
followed O
him O
. O

Jesus O
continued O
walking O
by O
Lake O
Galilee O
. O

He O
saw O
two O
other O
brothers O
, O
James O
and O
John O
, O
the O
sons O
of O
Zebedee O
. O

They O
were O
in O
a O
boat O
with O
their O
father O
Zebedee O
. O

They O
were O
preparing O
their O
nets O
to O
catch O
fish O
. O

Jesus O
told O
the O
brothers O
to O
come O
with O
him O
. O

So O
they O
immediately O
left O
the O
boat O
and O
their O
father O
, O
and O
they O
followed O
Jesus O
. O

Jesus O
went O
everywhere O
in O
the O
country O
of O
Galilee O
. O

He O
taught O
in O
the O
synagogues O
and O
told O
the O
Good O
News O
about O
God O
's O
kingdom O
. O

And O
he O
healed O
all O
the O
people O
's O
diseases O
and O
sicknesses O
. O

The O
news O
about O
Jesus O
spread O
all O
over O
Syria O
, O
and O
people O
brought O
to O
him O
all O
those O
who O
were O
sick O
. O

They O
were O
suffering O
from O
different O
kinds O
of O
diseases O
and O
pain O
. O

Some O
had O
demons O
inside O
them O
, O
some O
suffered O
from O
seizures O
, O
and O
some O
were O
paralyzed O
. O

Jesus O
healed O
them O
all O
. O

Large O
crowds O
followed O
him O
-- O
people O
from O
Galilee O
, O
the O
Ten O
Towns O
, O
Jerusalem O
, O
Judea O
, O
and O
the O
area O
across O
the O
Jordan O
River O
. O

Jesus O
came O
down O
from O
the O
hill O
, O
and O
a O
large O
crowd O
followed O
him O
. O

Then O
a O
man O
sick O
with O
leprosy O
came O
to O
him O
. O

The O
man O
bowed O
down O
before O
Jesus O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
you O
have O
the O
power O
to O
heal O
me O
if O
you O
want O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
touched O
the O
man O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
want O
to O
heal O
you O
. O

Be O
healed O
! O
'' O

Immediately O
the O
man O
was O
healed O
from O
his O
leprosy O
. O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
tell O
anyone O
about O
what O
happened O
. O

But O
go O
and O
let O
the O
priest O
look O
at O
you O
. O

And O
offer O
the O
gift O
that O
Moses O
commanded O
for O
people O
who O
are O
made O
well O
. O

This O
will O
show O
everyone O
that O
you O
are O
healed O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
went O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Capernaum O
. O

When O
he O
entered O
the O
city O
, O
an O
army O
officer O
came O
to O
him O
and O
begged O
for O
help O
. O

The O
officer O
said O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
my O
servant O
is O
very O
sick O
at O
home O
in O
bed O
. O

He O
ca O
n't O
move O
his O
body O
and O
has O
much O
pain O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
to O
the O
officer O
, O
`` O
I O
will O
go O
and O
heal O
him O
. O
'' O

The O
officer O
answered O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
I O
am O
not O
good O
enough O
for O
you O
to O
come O
into O
my O
house O
. O

You O
need O
only O
to O
give O
the O
order O
, O
and O
my O
servant O
will O
be O
healed O
. O

I O
know O
this O
, O
because O
I O
understand O
authority O
. O

There O
are O
people O
who O
have O
authority O
over O
me O
, O
and O
I O
have O
soldiers O
under O
my O
authority O
. O

I O
tell O
one O
soldier O
, O
' O
Go O
, O
' O
and O
he O
goes O
. O

I O
tell O
another O
soldier O
, O
' O
Come O
, O
' O
and O
he O
comes O

I O
say O
to O
my O
servant O
, O
' O
Do O
this O
, O
' O
and O
my O
servant O
obeys O
me O
. O
'' O

When O
Jesus O
heard O
this O
, O
he O
was O
amazed O
. O

He O
said O
to O
those O
who O
were O
with O
him O
, O
`` O
The O
truth O
is O
, O
this O
man O
has O
more O
faith O
than O
anyone O

have O
found O

in O
Israel O
. O

Many O
people O
will O
come O
from O
the O
east O
and O
from O
the O
west O

These O
people O
will O
sit O
and O
eat O
with O
Abraham O
, O
Isaac O
, O
and O
Jacob O
in O
God O
's O
kingdom O
. O

And O
those O
who O
should O
have O
the O
kingdom O
will O
be O
thrown O
out O
. O

They O
will O
be O
thrown O
outside O
into O
the O
darkness O
, O
where O
people O
will O
cry O
and O
grind O
their O
teeth O
with O
pain O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
to O
the O
officer O
, O
`` O
Go O
home O
. O

Your O
servant O
will O
be O
healed O
the O
way O
you O
believed O
he O
would O
. O
'' O

Right O
then O
his O
servant O
was O
healed O
. O

Jesus O
went O
to O
Peter O
's O
house O
. O

He O
saw O
that O
Peter O
's O
mother O
- O
in O
- O
law O
was O
in O
bed O
with O
a O
high O
fever O
. O

He O
touched O
her O
hand O
, O
and O
the O
fever O
left O
her O
. O

Then O
she O
stood O
up O
and O
began O
to O
serve O
him O
. O

That O
evening O
people O
brought O
to O
Jesus O
many O
people O
who O
had O
demons O
inside O
them O
. O

He O
spoke O
and O
the O
demons O
left O
the O
people O
. O

He O
healed O
all O
those O
who O
were O
sick O
. O

So O
Jesus O
made O
clear O
the O
full O
meaning O
of O
what O
Isaiah O
the O
prophet O
said O
: O
`` O
He O
took O
away O
our O
diseases O
and O
carried O
away O
our O
sicknesses O
. O
'' O

When O
Jesus O
saw O
the O
crowd O
around O
him O
, O
he O
told O
his O
followers O
to O
go O
to O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
lake O
. O

Then O
a O
teacher O
of O
the O
law O
came O
to O
him O
and O
said O
, O
`` O

Teacher O
, O
I O
will O
follow O
you O
any O
place O
you O
go O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
The O
foxes O
have O
holes O
to O
live O
in O
. O

The O
birds O
have O
nests O
. O

But O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O
has O
no O
place O
to O
rest O
. O
'' O

Another O
of O
Jesus O
' O
followers O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
I O
will O
follow O
you O
too O
, O
but O
let O
me O
go O
and O
bury O
my O
father O
first O
. O
'' O

But O
Jesus O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Follow O
me O
, O
and O
let O
those O
who O
are O
dead O
bury O
their O
own O
dead O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
got O
into O
a O
boat O
, O
and O
his O
followers O
went O
with O
him O
. O

After O
the O
boat O
left O
the O
shore O
, O
a O
very O
bad O
storm O
began O
on O
the O
lake O
. O

The O
waves O
covered O
the O
boat O
. O

But O
Jesus O
was O
sleeping O
. O

The O
followers O
went O
to O
him O
and O
woke O
him O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
save O
us O
! O

We O
will O
drown O
! O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
Why O
are O
you O
afraid O
? O

You O
do O
n't O
have O
enough O
faith O
. O
'' O

Then O
he O
stood O
up O
and O
gave O
a O
command O
to O
the O
wind O
and O
the O
water O
. O

The O
wind O
stopped O
, O
and O
the O
lake O
became O
very O
calm O
. O

The O
men O
were O
amazed O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
What O
kind O
of O
man O
is O
this O
? O

Even O
the O
wind O
and O
the O
water O
obey O
him O
! O
'' O

Jesus O
arrived O
at O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
lake O
in O
the O
country O
of O
the O
Gadarene O
people O
. O

There O
, O
two O
men O
who O
had O
demons O
inside O
them O
came O
to O
him O
. O

They O
lived O
in O
the O
burial O
caves O
and O
were O
so O
dangerous O
that O
no O
one O
could O
use O
the O
road O
by O
those O
caves O
. O

They O
came O
to O
Jesus O
and O
shouted O
, O
`` O
What O
do O
you O
want O
with O
us O
, O
Son O
of O
God O
? O

Did O
you O
come O
here O
to O
punish O
us O
before O
the O
right O
time O
? O
'' O

Near O
that O
place O
there O
was O
a O
large O
herd O
of O
pigs O
feeding O
. O

The O
demons O
begged O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
If O
you O
make O
us O
leave O
these O
men O
, O
please O
send O
us O
into O
that O
herd O
of O
pigs O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Go O
! O
'' O

So O
the O
demons O
left O
the O
men O
and O
went O
into O
the O
pigs O
. O

Then O
the O
whole O
herd O
of O
pigs O
ran O
down O
the O
hill O
into O
the O
lake O
, O
and O
all O
were O
drowned O
. O

The O
men O
who O
had O
the O
work O
of O
caring O
for O
the O
pigs O
ran O
away O
. O

They O
went O
into O
town O
and O
told O
the O
people O
everything O
that O
happened O
, O
especially O
about O
the O
men O
who O
had O
the O
demons O
. O

Then O
the O
whole O
town O
went O
out O
to O
see O
Jesus O
. O

When O
the O
people O
saw O
him O
, O
they O
begged O
him O
to O
leave O
their O
area O
. O

`` O
Be O
careful O
! O

When O
you O
do O
something O
good O
, O
do O
n't O
do O
it O
in O

of O

so O
that O
they O
will O
see O

If O
you O
do O
that O

you O
will O

`` O
When O

the O
hypocrites O

When O
they O
are O
in O
the O
synagogues O
and O
on O
the O
streets O
, O
they O
blow O
trumpets O
before O
they O
give O
so O
that O
people O
will O
see O
them O

They O
want O
everyone O
to O
praise O
them O

The O
truth O
is O
, O
that O
's O
all O
the O
reward O

will O
get O

So O
when O
you O
give O
to O
the O
poor O
, O
do O
n't O
let O
anyone O
know O
what O
you O
are O

Your O
Father O
can O

he O
will O
reward O
you O

`` O
When O
you O
pray O
, O
do O
n't O
be O

They O
love O
to O
stand O
in O
the O
synagogues O
and O
on O
the O
street O
corners O
and O
pray O
loudly O

They O

The O
truth O
is O
, O
that O
's O
all O
the O
reward O

will O
get O

But O
when O
you O
pray O
, O
you O
should O
go O
into O
your O
room O
and O
close O
the O
door O
. O

Then O
pray O
to O
your O
Father O
. O

He O
is O
there O
in O
that O
private O

He O
can O
see O

will O
reward O

`` O
And O
when O
you O

They O

Your O

this O
is O
how O
you O

Forgive O

Yes O
, O
if O
you O

then O
your O
Father O

will O
also O

But O
if O

`` O
When O

You O
can O

add O
any O

by O
worrying O

`` O
And O
why O

how O

They O
do O

But O
I O
tell O

even O
Solomon O

great O

rich O
king O

was O
not O
dressed O

If O
God O

what O
do O
you O
think O
he O
will O
do O
for O

It O
's O
just O
grass O

one O
day O
it O
's O
alive O

and O
the O
next O
day O
someone O
throws O
it O
into O
a O
fire O

But O
God O
cares O
enough O
to O
make O
it O
beautiful O

Surely O
he O
will O
do O
much O
more O
for O
you O

Your O
faith O

so O
small O

`` O
Do O

Six O
days O
later O
, O
Jesus O
took O
Peter O
, O
James O
, O
and O
John O
the O
brother O
of O
James O
and O
went O
up O
on O
a O
high O
mountain O
. O

They O
were O
all O
alone O
there O
. O

While O
these O
followers O
watched O
him O
, O
Jesus O
was O
changed O
. O

His O
face O
became O
bright O
like O
the O
sun O
, O
and O
his O
clothes O
became O
white O
as O
light O
. O

Then O
two O
men O
were O
there O
, O
talking O
with O
him O
. O

They O
were O
Moses O
and O
Elijah O
. O

Peter O
said O
to O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
it O
is O
good O
that O
we O
are O
here O
. O

If O
you O
want O
, O
I O
will O
put O
three O
tents O
here O
-- O
one O
for O
you O
, O
one O
for O
Moses O
, O
and O
one O
for O
Elijah O
. O
'' O

While O
Peter O
was O
talking O
, O
a O
bright O
cloud O
came O
over O
them O
. O

A O
voice O
came O
from O
the O
cloud O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
This O
is O
my O
Son O
, O
the O
one O
I O
love O
. O

I O
am O
very O
pleased O
with O
him O
. O

Obey O
him O
! O
'' O

The O
followers O
with O
Jesus O
heard O
this O
voice O
. O

They O
were O
very O
afraid O
, O
so O
they O
fell O
to O
the O
ground O
. O

But O
Jesus O
came O
to O
them O
and O
touched O
them O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Stand O
up O
. O

Do O
n't O
be O
afraid O
. O
'' O

The O
followers O
looked O
up O
, O
and O
they O
saw O
that O
Jesus O
was O
now O
alone O
. O

As O
Jesus O
and O
the O
followers O
were O
coming O
down O
the O
mountain O
, O
he O
gave O
them O
this O
command O
: O
`` O
Do O
n't O
tell O
anyone O
about O
what O
you O
saw O
on O
the O
mountain O
. O

Wait O
until O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O
has O
been O
raised O
from O
death O
. O

Then O
you O
can O
tell O
people O
about O
what O
you O
saw O
. O
'' O

The O
followers O
asked O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
Why O
do O
the O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
say O
that O
Elijah O
must O
come O
before O
the O
Christ O
comes O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
They O
are O
right O
to O
say O
Elijah O
is O
coming O
. O

And O
it O
is O
true O
that O
Elijah O
will O
make O
all O
things O
the O
way O
they O
should O
be O
. O

But O
I O
tell O
you O
, O
Elijah O
has O
already O
come O
. O

People O
did O
not O
know O
who O
he O
was O
, O
and O
they O
treated O
him O
badly O
, O
doing O
whatever O
they O
wanted O
to O
do O
. O

It O
is O
the O
same O
with O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O
. O

Those O
same O
people O
will O
make O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O
suffer O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
followers O
understood O
that O
when O
Jesus O
said O
Elijah O
, O
he O
was O
really O
talking O
about O
John O
the O
Baptizer O
. O

Jesus O
and O
the O
followers O
went O
back O
to O
the O
people O
. O

A O
man O
came O
to O
Jesus O
and O
bowed O
before O
him O
. O

The O
man O
said O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
be O
kind O
to O
my O
son O
. O

He O
suffers O
so O
much O
from O
the O
seizures O
he O
has O
. O

He O
often O
falls O
into O
the O
fire O
or O
into O
the O
water O
. O

I O
brought O
him O
to O
your O
followers O
, O
but O
they O
could O
not O
heal O
him O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
You O
people O
today O
have O
no O
faith O

Your O
lives O
are O
so O
wrong O
! O

How O
long O
must O
I O
stay O
with O
you O
? O

How O
long O
must O
I O
continue O
to O
be O
patient O
with O
you O
? O

Bring O
the O
boy O
here O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
gave O
a O
strong O
command O
to O
the O
demon O
inside O
the O
boy O
. O

The O
demon O
came O
out O
of O
the O
boy O
, O
and O
the O
boy O
was O
healed O
. O

Then O
the O
followers O
came O
to O
Jesus O
alone O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
We O
tried O
to O
force O
the O
demon O
out O
of O
the O
boy O
, O
but O
we O
could O
not O
. O

Why O
were O
we O
not O
able O
to O
make O
the O
demon O
go O
out O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
You O
were O
not O
able O
to O
make O
the O
demon O
go O
out O
, O
because O
your O
faith O
is O
too O
small O
. O

Believe O
me O
when O
I O
tell O
you O
, O
if O
your O
faith O
is O
only O
as O
big O
as O
a O
mustard O
seed O
you O
can O
say O
to O
this O
mountain O
, O
' O
Move O
from O
here O
to O
there O
, O
' O
and O
it O
will O
move O

You O
will O
be O
able O
to O
do O
anything O

'' O

Later O
, O
the O
followers O
met O
together O
in O
Galilee O
. O

Jesus O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
The O
Son O
of O
Man O
will O
be O
handed O
over O
to O
the O
control O
of O
other O
men O
, O

will O
kill O
him O

But O
on O
the O
third O
day O
he O
will O
be O
raised O
from O
death O

'' O

The O
followers O
were O
very O
sad O
to O
hear O
that O
Jesus O
would O
be O
killed O
. O

Jesus O
and O
his O
followers O
went O
to O
Capernaum O
. O

There O
the O
men O
who O
collect O
the O
two O
- O
drachma O
Temple O
tax O
came O
to O
Peter O
and O
asked O
, O
`` O
Does O
your O
teacher O
pay O
the O
Temple O
tax O
? O
'' O

Peter O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
he O
does O
. O
'' O

Peter O
went O
into O
the O
house O
where O
Jesus O
was O
. O

Before O
Peter O
could O
speak O
, O
Jesus O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
The O
kings O
on O
the O
earth O
get O
different O
kinds O
of O
taxes O
from O
people O
. O

But O
who O
are O
those O
who O
pay O
the O
taxes O
? O

Are O
they O
the O
king O
's O
children O
? O

Or O
do O
other O
people O
pay O
the O
taxes O
? O

What O
do O
you O
think O
? O
'' O

Peter O
answered O
, O
`` O
The O
other O
people O
pay O
the O
taxes O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Then O
the O
children O
of O
the O
king O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
pay O
taxes O
. O

But O
we O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
upset O
these O
tax O
collectors O
. O

So O
do O
this O
: O
Go O
to O
the O
lake O
and O
fish O
. O

After O
you O
catch O
the O
first O
fish O
, O
open O
its O
mouth O
. O

Inside O
its O
mouth O
you O
will O
find O
a O
four O
- O
drachma O
coin O
. O

Take O
that O
coin O
and O
give O
it O
to O
the O
tax O
collectors O
. O

That O
will O
pay O
the O
tax O
for O
you O
and O
me O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
left O
the O
Temple O
area O
and O
was O
walking O
away O
. O

But O
his O
followers O
came O
to O
him O
to O
show O
him O
the O
Temple O
's O
buildings O
. O

He O
asked O
them O
, O
`` O
Are O
you O
looking O
at O
these O
buildings O
? O

The O
fact O
is O
, O
they O
will O
be O
destroyed O

Every O
stone O
will O
be O
thrown O
down O
to O
the O
ground O
. O

Not O
one O
stone O
will O
be O
left O
on O
another O

Later O
, O
Jesus O
was O
sitting O
at O
a O
place O
on O
the O
Mount O
of O
Olives O
. O

The O
followers O
came O
to O
be O
alone O
with O
him O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Tell O

prepare O
us O

your O
coming O

the O
end O

answered O
, O
`` O
Be O

Many O
people O

will O
choose O

what O
will O
happen O

the O

punish O

He O

him O
away O

The O
day O
after O
the O
Sabbath O

the O
first O

That O
day O
at O
dawn O
Mary O
Magdalene O
and O
the O
other O
woman O
named O

went O
to O
look O
at O
the O
tomb O

Suddenly O
an O
angel O
of O
the O
Lord O
came O
from O
the O
sky O
, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
huge O
earthquake O
. O

The O
angel O
went O
to O
the O
tomb O
and O
rolled O
the O
stone O
away O
from O
the O
entrance O
. O

Then O
he O
sat O
on O
top O
of O
the O
stone O
. O

The O
angel O
was O
shining O
as O
bright O
as O
lightning O
. O

His O
clothes O
were O
as O
white O
as O
snow O
. O

The O
soldiers O
guarding O
the O
tomb O
were O
very O
afraid O
of O
the O
angel O
. O

They O
shook O
with O
fear O
and O
then O
became O
like O
dead O
men O
. O

The O
angel O
said O
to O
the O
women O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
be O
afraid O

I O
know O
you O
are O
looking O
for O

the O
one O
who O
was O
killed O
on O
the O
cross O

But O
he O
is O
not O
here O

He O
has O
risen O
from O
death O
, O
as O
he O
said O
he O
would O

Come O
and O
see O
the O
place O
where O
his O
body O
was O

And O
go O
quickly O
and O
tell O
his O
followers O
, O
' O
Jesus O
has O
risen O
from O
death O

He O
is O
going O
into O
Galilee O
and O
will O
be O
there O
before O
you O

You O
will O
see O
him O
there O

'' O

Then O
the O
angel O
said O
, O
`` O
Now O
I O
have O
told O
you O

'' O

So O
the O
women O
left O
the O
tomb O
quickly O
. O

They O
were O
afraid O
, O
but O
they O
were O
also O
very O
happy O
. O

They O
ran O
to O
tell O
his O
followers O
what O
happened O
. O

Suddenly O
, O
Jesus O
was O
there O
in O
front O
of O
them O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Hello O
! O
'' O

The O
women O
went O
to O
him O
and O
, O
holding O
on O
to O
his O
feet O
, O
worshiped O
him O
. O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
be O
afraid O

Go O
tell O
my O
followers O
to O
go O
to O
Galilee O
. O

They O
will O
see O
me O
there O

'' O

The O
women O
went O
to O
tell O
the O
followers O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
some O
of O
the O
soldiers O
who O
were O
guarding O
the O
tomb O
went O
into O
the O
city O
. O

They O
went O
to O
tell O
the O
leading O
priests O
everything O
that O
happened O
. O

Then O
the O
priests O
met O
with O
the O
older O
Jewish O
leaders O
and O
made O
a O
plan O
. O

They O
paid O
the O
soldiers O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
and O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Tell O
the O
people O
that O
Jesus O
' O
followers O
came O
during O
the O
night O
and O
stole O
the O
body O
while O
you O
were O
sleeping O

If O
the O
governor O
hears O
about O
this O
, O
we O
will O
talk O
to O
him O
and O
keep O
you O
out O
of O
trouble O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
soldiers O
kept O
the O
money O
and O
obeyed O
the O
priests O
. O

And O
that O
story O
is O
still O
spread O
among O
the O
Jews O
even O
today O
. O

The O
eleven O
followers O
went O
to O
Galilee O
, O
to O
the O
mountain O
where O
Jesus O
told O
them O
to O
go O
. O

On O
the O
mountain O
the O
followers O
saw O
Jesus O
. O

They O
worshiped O
him O
. O

But O
some O
of O
the O
followers O
did O
not O
believe O
that O
it O
was O
really O
Jesus O
. O

So O
he O
came O
to O
them O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
All O
authority O
in O
heaven O
and O
on O
earth O

So O
go O

all O
people O

Baptize O

name O

obey O

do O

You O
can O
be O
sure O
that O
I O
will O
be O
with O
you O
always O

I O
will O
continue O
with O
you O
until O
the O
end O
of O
time O

'' O

About O
that O
time O
the O
followers O
came O
to O
Jesus O
and O
asked O
, O
`` O
Who O
is O
the O
greatest O
in O
God O
's O
kingdom O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
called O
a O
little O
child O
to O
come O
to O
him O
. O

He O
stood O
the O
child O
in O
front O
of O
the O
followers O
. O

Then O
he O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
truth O
is O
, O
you O
must O
change O
your O
thinking O
and O
become O
like O
little O
children O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
do O
this O
, O
you O
will O
never O
enter O
God O
's O
kingdom O

The O
greatest O
person O
in O
God O
's O
kingdom O
is O
the O
one O
who O
makes O
himself O
humble O
like O
this O
child O

`` O
Whoever O
accepts O

little O
child O

this O

accepting O
me O

`` O

one O
of O
these O
little O
children O
believes O
in O
me O
, O
and O
someone O
causes O
that O
child O
to O
sin O
, O
it O
will O
be O
very O
bad O
for O
that O
person O
. O

It O
would O
be O
better O
for O
them O
to O
have O
a O
millstone O
tied O
around O
their O
neck O
and O
be O
drowned O
in O
the O
deep O
sea O
. O

I O
feel O
sorry O

the O
world O

very O
bad O

happen O

`` O
If O
your O
hand O
or O
your O
foot O
makes O
you O
sin O

cut O
it O
off O

throw O
it O
away O

is O
better O

Then O
Peter O
came O
to O

asked O

Jesus O
answered O

`` O
I O
tell O
you O
, O
you O

You O

seventy O

seven O

`` O
So O
God O

kingdom O
is O
like O
a O
king O
who O
decided O
to O
collect O
the O
money O
his O
servants O
owed O
him O
. O

The O
king O
began O
to O
collect O
his O
money O
. O

One O
servant O
owed O
him O
several O
thousand O
pounds O
of O
silver O
. O

He O
was O
not O
able O
to O
pay O
the O
money O
to O
his O
master O
, O
the O
king O
. O

So O
the O
master O
ordered O
that O
he O
and O
everything O
he O
owned O
be O
sold O
, O
even O
his O
wife O
and O
children O
. O

The O
money O
would O
be O
used O
to O
pay O
the O
king O
what O
the O
servant O
owed O
. O

`` O
But O
the O
servant O
fell O
on O
his O

begged O
, O
' O
Be O
patient O
with O
me O
. O

I O
will O
pay O
you O
everything O
I O
owe O
. O
' O

The O
master O
felt O
sorry O
for O
him O
. O

So O
he O
told O
the O
servant O
he O
did O
not O
have O
to O
pay O
. O

He O
let O
him O
go O
free O
. O

`` O
Later O
, O
that O
same O
servant O
found O
another O
servant O
who O
owed O
him O
a O
hundred O
silver O
coins O
. O

He O
grabbed O
him O
around O
the O
neck O
and O
said O
, O
' O
Pay O
me O
the O
money O
you O
owe O
me O
! O
' O

`` O
The O
other O
servant O
fell O
on O

begged O
him O

I O
will O
pay O

`` O
But O
the O
first O
servant O
refused O
to O
be O
patient O

He O
told O
the O
judge O
that O
the O
other O
servant O
owed O
him O
money O
, O
and O
that O
servant O
was O
put O
in O
jail O
until O
he O
could O
pay O
everything O
he O

All O
the O
other O
servants O
saw O
what O
happened O

They O
felt O
very O
sorry O
for O
the O
man O

So O
they O
went O
and O
told O
their O
master O
everything O
that O
happened O

`` O
Then O
the O
master O
called O
his O
servant O
in O
and O
said O
, O
' O
You O
evil O
servant O

You O
begged O
me O
to O
forgive O
your O
debt O
, O
and O
I O
said O
you O
did O
not O
have O
to O
pay O
anything O

So O
you O
should O
have O
given O
that O
other O
man O
who O
serves O
with O
you O
the O
same O
mercy O
I O
gave O
you O

' O

The O
master O
was O
very O
angry O
, O
so O
he O
put O
the O
servant O
in O
jail O
to O
be O
punished O
. O

And O
he O
had O
to O
stay O
in O
jail O
until O
he O
could O
pay O
everything O
he O
owed O

`` O
This O
king O
did O
the O

as O
my O

Father O

do O
to O
you O

You O
must O
forgive O
your O

all O
your O

my O
heavenly O
Father O

'' O

Early O
the O
next O
morning O
, O
all O
the O
leading O
priests O
and O
older O
leaders O
of O
the O
people O
met O
and O
decided O
to O
kill O
Jesus O
. O

They O
tied O
him O
, O
led O
him O
away O
, O
and O
handed O
him O
over O
to O
Pilate O
, O
the O
governor O
. O

Judas O
saw O
that O
they O
had O
decided O
to O
kill O
Jesus O
. O

He O
was O
the O
one O
who O
had O
handed O
him O
over O
. O

When O
he O
saw O
what O
happened O
, O
he O
was O
very O
sorry O
for O
what O
he O
had O
done O
. O

So O
he O
took O
the O
30 O
silver O
coins O
back O
to O
the O
priests O
and O
the O
older O
leaders O
. O

Judas O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
sinned O
. O

I O
handed O
over O
to O
you O
an O
innocent O
man O
to O
be O
killed O
. O
'' O

The O
Jewish O
leaders O
answered O
, O
`` O
We O
do O
n't O
care O
! O

That O
's O
a O
problem O
for O
you O
, O
not O
us O
. O
'' O

So O
Judas O
threw O
the O
money O
into O
the O
Temple O
. O

Then O
he O
went O
out O
from O
there O
and O
hanged O
himself O
. O

The O
leading O
priests O
picked O
up O
the O
silver O
coins O
in O
the O
Temple O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Our O
law O
does O
not O
allow O
us O
to O
keep O
this O
money O
with O
the O
Temple O
money O
, O
because O
this O
money O
has O
paid O
for O
a O
man O
's O
death O
. O
'' O

So O
they O
decided O
to O
use O
the O
money O
to O
buy O
a O
field O
called O
Potter O
's O
Field O
. O

This O
field O
would O
be O
a O
place O
to O
bury O
people O
who O
died O
while O
visiting O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

That O
is O
why O
that O
field O
is O
still O
called O
the O
Field O
of O
Blood O
. O

This O
showed O
the O
full O
meaning O
of O
what O
Jeremiah O
the O
prophet O
said O
: O
`` O
They O
took O
30 O
silver O
coins O
. O

That O
was O
how O
much O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
decided O
to O
pay O
for O
his O
life O
. O

They O
used O
those O
30 O
silver O
coins O
to O
buy O
the O
potter O
's O
field O
, O
as O
the O
Lord O
commanded O
me O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
stood O
before O
Pilate O
, O
the O
governor O
, O
who O
asked O
him O
, O
`` O
Are O
you O
the O
king O
of O
the O
Jews O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
that O
's O
right O
. O
'' O

Then O
, O
when O
the O
leading O
priests O
and O
the O
older O
Jewish O
leaders O
made O
their O
accusations O
against O
Jesus O
, O
he O
said O
nothing O
. O

So O
Pilate O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
you O
hear O
all O
these O
charges O
they O
are O
making O
against O
you O
? O

Why O
do O
n't O
you O
answer O
? O
'' O

But O
Jesus O
did O
not O
say O
anything O
, O
and O
this O
really O
surprised O
the O
governor O
. O

Every O
year O
at O
Passover O
time O
the O
governor O
would O
free O
one O
prisoner O
-- O
whichever O
one O
the O
people O
wanted O
him O
to O
free O
. O

At O
that O
time O
there O
was O
a O
man O
in O
prison O
who O
was O
known O
to O
be O
very O
bad O
. O

His O
name O
was O
Barabbas O
. O

When O
a O
crowd O
gathered O
, O
Pilate O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
I O
will O
free O
one O
man O
for O
you O
. O

Which O
one O
do O
you O
want O
me O
to O
free O
: O
Barabbas O
or O
Jesus O
who O
is O
called O
the O
Christ O
? O
'' O

Pilate O
knew O
that O
they O
had O
handed O
Jesus O
over O
to O
him O
because O
they O
were O
jealous O
of O
him O
. O

While O
Pilate O
was O
sitting O
there O
in O
the O
place O
for O
judging O
, O
his O
wife O
sent O
a O
message O
to O
him O
. O

It O
said O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
do O
anything O
with O
that O
man O
. O

He O
is O
not O
guilty O
. O

Last O
night O
I O
had O
a O
dream O
about O
him O
, O
and O
it O
troubled O
me O
very O
much O
. O
'' O

But O
the O
leading O
priests O
and O
older O
Jewish O
leaders O
told O
the O
people O
to O
ask O
for O
Barabbas O
to O
be O
set O
free O
and O
for O
Jesus O
to O
be O
killed O
. O

Pilate O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
have O
Barabbas O
and O
Jesus O
. O

Which O
one O
do O
you O
want O
me O
to O
set O
free O
for O
you O
? O
'' O

The O
people O
answered O
, O
`` O
Barabbas O
! O
'' O

Pilate O
asked O
, O
`` O
So O
what O
should O
I O
do O
with O
Jesus O
, O
the O
one O
called O
the O
Christ O
? O
'' O

All O
the O
people O
said O
, O
`` O
Kill O
him O
on O
a O
cross O
! O
'' O

Pilate O
asked O
, O
`` O
Why O
do O
you O
want O
me O
to O
kill O
him O
? O

What O
wrong O
has O
he O
done O
? O
'' O

But O
they O
shouted O
louder O
, O
`` O
Kill O
him O
on O
a O
cross O
! O
'' O

Pilate O
saw O
that O
there O
was O
nothing O
he O
could O
do O
to O
make O
the O
people O
change O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
looked O
as O
if O
there O
would O
be O
a O
riot O
. O

So O
he O
took O
some O
water O
and O
washed O
his O
hands O
in O
front O
of O
them O
all O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
not O
guilty O
of O
this O
man O
's O
death O
. O

You O
are O
the O
ones O
who O
are O
doing O
it O
! O
'' O

The O
people O
answered O
, O
`` O
We O
will O
take O
full O
responsibility O
for O
his O
death O
. O

You O
can O
blame O
us O
and O
even O
our O
children O
! O
'' O

Then O
Pilate O
set O
Barabbas O
free O
. O

And O
he O
told O
some O
soldiers O
to O
beat O
Jesus O
with O
whips O
. O

Then O
he O
handed O
him O
over O
to O
the O
soldiers O
to O
be O
killed O
on O
a O
cross O
. O

Then O
Pilate O
's O
soldiers O
took O
Jesus O
into O
the O
governor O
's O
palace O
. O

All O
the O
soldiers O
gathered O
around O
him O
. O

They O
took O
off O
Jesus O
' O
clothes O
and O
put O
a O
red O
robe O
on O
him O
. O

Then O
they O
made O
a O
crown O
from O
thorny O
branches O
and O
put O
it O
on O
his O
head O
, O
and O
they O
put O
a O
stick O
in O
his O
right O
hand O
. O

Then O
they O
bowed O
before O
him O
, O
making O
fun O
of O
him O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
We O
salute O
you O
, O
king O
of O
the O
Jews O
! O
'' O

They O
spit O
on O
him O
. O

Then O
they O
took O
his O
stick O
and O
kept O
hitting O
him O
on O
the O
head O
with O
it O
. O

After O
they O
finished O
making O
fun O
of O
him O
, O
the O
soldiers O
took O
off O
the O
robe O
and O
put O
his O
own O
clothes O
on O
him O
again O
. O

Then O
they O
led O
him O
away O
to O
be O
killed O
on O
a O
cross O
. O

The O
soldiers O
were O
going O
out O
of O
the O
city O
with O
Jesus O
. O

They O
saw O
a O
man O
from O
Cyrene O
named O
Simon O
, O
and O
they O
forced O
him O
to O
carry O
Jesus O
' O
cross O

They O
came O
to O
the O
place O
called O
Golgotha O

-LRB- O
Golgotha O
means O
`` O
The O
Place O
of O

Skull O

-RRB- O

There O
the O
soldiers O
gave O
Jesus O
some O
wine O
mixed O
with O
gall O

But O
when O
he O
tasted O
it O
, O
he O
refused O
to O
drink O
it O
. O

The O
soldiers O
nailed O
Jesus O
to O
a O
cross O

Then O
they O
threw O
dice O
to O
divide O
his O
clothes O
between O
them O
. O

The O
soldiers O
stayed O
there O
to O
guard O
him O
. O

They O
put O
a O
sign O
above O
his O
head O
with O
the O
charge O
against O
him O
written O
on O
it O
: O
`` O
this O
is O

the O
king O
of O

jews O

Two O
criminals O
were O
nailed O
to O
crosses O
beside O
Jesus O

one O
on O
the O
right O

the O
other O
on O
the O
left O

People O
walked O
by O

shouted O
insults O
at O

shook O
their O
heads O

said O

, O
but O
he O
ca O
n't O
save O
himself O
! O

People O
say O
he O
is O
the O
king O
of O
Israel O
. O

If O
he O
is O
the O
king O
, O
he O
should O
come O
down O
now O
from O
the O
cross O
. O

Then O
we O
will O
believe O
in O
him O
. O

He O
trusted O
God O
. O

So O
let O
God O
save O
him O
now O
, O
if O
God O
really O
wants O
him O
. O

He O
himself O
said O
, O
' O
I O
am O
the O
Son O
of O
God O
. O
' O
'' O

And O
in O
the O
same O
way O
, O
the O
criminals O
on O
the O
crosses O
beside O
Jesus O
also O
insulted O
him O
. O

At O
noon O
the O
whole O
country O
became O
dark O
. O

The O
darkness O
continued O
for O
three O
hours O
. O

About O
three O
o'clock O
Jesus O
cried O
out O
loudly O
, O
`` O
Eli O
, O
Eli O
, O
lema O
sabachthani O
? O
'' O

This O
means O
`` O
My O
God O
, O
my O
God O
, O
why O
have O
you O
left O
me O
alone O
? O
'' O

Some O
of O
the O
people O
standing O
there O
heard O
this O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
He O
is O
calling O
Elijah O
. O
'' O

Quickly O
, O
one O
of O
them O
ran O
and O
got O
a O
sponge O
. O

He O
filled O
the O
sponge O
with O
sour O
wine O
and O
tied O
the O
sponge O
to O
a O
stick O
. O

Then O
he O
used O
the O
stick O
to O
give O
the O
sponge O
to O
Jesus O
to O
get O
a O
drink O
from O
it O
. O

But O
the O
others O
said O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
bother O
him O
. O

We O
want O
to O
see O
if O
Elijah O
will O
come O
to O
save O
him O
. O
'' O

Again O
Jesus O
cried O
out O
loudly O
and O
then O
died O
. O

When O
Jesus O
died O
, O
the O
curtain O
in O
the O
Temple O
was O
torn O
into O
two O
pieces O
. O

The O
tear O
started O
at O
the O
top O
and O
tore O
all O
the O
way O
to O
the O
bottom O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
earth O
shook O
and O
rocks O
were O
broken O
. O

The O
graves O
opened O
, O
and O
many O
of O
God O
's O
people O
who O
had O
died O
were O
raised O
from O
death O
. O

They O
came O
out O
of O
the O
graves O
. O

And O
after O
Jesus O
was O
raised O
from O
death O
, O
they O
went O
into O
the O
holy O
city O
, O
and O
many O
people O
saw O
them O
. O

The O
army O
officer O
and O
the O
soldiers O
guarding O
Jesus O
saw O
this O
earthquake O
and O
everything O
that O
happened O
. O

They O
were O
very O
afraid O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
He O
really O
was O
the O
Son O
of O
God O
! O
'' O

Many O
women O
were O
standing O
away O
from O
the O
cross O
, O
watching O
. O

These O
were O
the O
women O
who O
had O
followed O
Jesus O
from O
Galilee O
to O
care O
for O
him O

Mary O

Mary O

mother O
of O
James O
and O
Joseph O
, O
and O
the O
mother O
of O
James O

John O
were O
there O
. O

That O
evening O
a O
rich O
man O
named O
Joseph O
came O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

He O
was O
a O
follower O
of O
Jesus O
from O
the O
town O
of O

`` O

When O
Jesus O
finished O
speaking O
, O
the O
people O
were O
amazed O
at O
his O
teaching O

He O
did O
not O
teach O
like O
their O
teachers O

He O
taught O
like O
someone O
who O
has O
authority O

About O
that O

time O
, O
Jesus O
was O
walking O
through O
the O
fields O
of O
grain O
on O
a O
Sabbath O
day O
. O

His O
followers O
were O
with O
him O
, O
and O
they O
were O
hungry O
. O

So O
they O
began O
to O
pick O
the O
grain O
and O
eat O
it O
. O

The O
Pharisees O
saw O
this O
. O

They O
said O
to O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
Look O
! O

Your O
followers O
are O
doing O
something O
that O
is O
against O
the O
law O

do O
on O

Sabbath O
day O

'' O

Jesus O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
You O
have O
read O
what O
David O
did O
when O
he O
and O
those O
with O
him O
were O
hungry O
. O

David O
went O
into O
God O
's O
house O
. O

He O
and O
those O
with O
him O
ate O
the O
bread O
that O
was O
offered O
to O
God O
. O

It O
was O
against O
the O
law O
for O
David O
or O
those O
with O
him O
to O
eat O
that O
bread O
. O

Only O
the O
priests O
were O
allowed O
to O
eat O
it O
. O

And O
you O
have O
read O
in O
the O
Law O
of O
Moses O
that O
on O
every O
Sabbath O
day O
the O
priests O
at O
the O
Temple O
break O
the O
law O
about O
the O
Sabbath O
day O
. O

But O
they O
are O
not O
wrong O
for O
doing O
that O
. O

I O
tell O
you O
that O
there O
is O
something O
here O
that O
is O
greater O
than O
the O
Temple O
. O

The O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
' O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
animal O
sacrifices O
; O
I O
want O
you O
to O
show O
kindness O
to O
people O
. O
' O

You O
do O
n't O
really O
know O
what O
that O
means O
. O

If O
you O
understood O
it O
, O
you O
would O
not O
judge O
those O
who O
have O
done O
nothing O
wrong O
. O

`` O
The O
Son O
of O
Man O
is O
Lord O
over O
the O
Sabbath O
day O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
went O
from O
there O
to O
their O
synagogue O
. O

In O
the O
synagogue O
there O
was O
a O
man O
with O
a O
crippled O
hand O
. O

Some O
Jews O
there O
were O
looking O
for O
a O
reason O
to O
accuse O
Jesus O
of O
doing O
wrong O
. O

So O
they O
asked O
him O
, O
`` O
Is O
it O
right O
to O
heal O
on O
the O
Sabbath O
day O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
If O
any O
of O
you O
has O
a O
sheep O
and O
it O
falls O
into O
a O
ditch O
on O
the O
Sabbath O
day O
, O
you O
will O
take O
the O
sheep O
and O
help O
it O
out O
of O
the O
ditch O
. O

Surely O
a O
man O
is O
more O
important O
than O
a O
sheep O
. O

So O
it O
is O
right O
to O
do O
good O
on O
the O
Sabbath O
day O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
to O
the O
man O
with O
the O
crippled O
hand O
, O
`` O
Hold O
out O
your O
hand O
. O
'' O

The O
man O
held O
out O
his O
hand O
, O
and O
it O
became O
well O
again O
, O
the O
same O
as O
the O
other O
hand O
. O

But O
the O
Pharisees O
left O
and O
made O
plans O
to O
kill O
Jesus O
. O

Jesus O
knew O
what O
the O
Pharisees O
were O
planning O
. O

So O
he O
left O
that O
place O
, O
and O
many O
people O
followed O
him O
. O

He O
healed O
all O
who O
were O
sick O
, O
but O
he O
warned O
them O
not O
to O
tell O
others O
who O
he O
was O
. O

This O
was O
to O
give O
full O
meaning O
to O
what O
Isaiah O
the O
prophet O
said O
when O
he O
spoke O
for O
God O
: O
`` O
Here O
is O
my O
servant O
, O
the O
one O
I O
have O
chosen O
. O

He O
is O
the O
one O
I O
love O
, O
and O
I O
am O
very O
pleased O
with O
him O
. O

I O
will O
fill O
him O
with O
my O
Spirit O
, O
and O
he O
will O
bring O
justice O
to O
the O
nations O
. O

He O
will O
not O
argue O
or O
shout O
; O
no O
one O
will O
hear O
his O
voice O
in O
the O
streets O
. O

He O
will O
not O
break O
off O
even O
a O
bent O
stem O
of O
grass O
. O

He O
will O
not O
put O
out O
even O
the O
weakest O
flame O
. O

He O
will O
not O
give O
up O
until O
he O
has O
made O
justice O
victorious O
. O

All O
people O
will O
hope O
in O
him O
. O
'' O

Then O
some O
people O
brought O
a O
man O
to O
Jesus O
. O

This O
man O
was O
blind O
and O
could O
not O
talk O
, O
because O
he O
had O
a O
demon O
inside O
him O
. O

Jesus O
healed O
the O
man O
, O
and O
he O
could O
talk O
and O
see O
. O

All O
the O
people O
were O
amazed O
at O
what O
Jesus O
did O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Maybe O
he O
is O
the O
promised O
Son O
of O
David O
! O
'' O

When O
the O
Pharisees O
heard O
this O
, O
they O
said O
, O
`` O

This O
man O
uses O
the O
power O
of O
Satan O
to O
force O
demons O
out O
of O
people O
. O

Satan O
is O
the O
ruler O
of O
demons O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
knew O
what O
the O
Pharisees O
were O
thinking O
. O

So O
he O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Every O
kingdom O
that O
fights O
against O
itself O
will O
be O
destroyed O
. O

And O
every O
city O
or O
family O
that O
is O
divided O
against O
itself O
will O
not O
survive O
. O

So O
if O
Satan O
forces O
out O
his O
own O
demons O
, O
then O
he O
is O
fighting O
against O
himself O
, O
and O
his O
kingdom O
will O
not O
survive O
. O

You O
say O
that O
I O
use O
the O
power O
of O
Satan O
to O
force O
out O
demons O
. O

If O
that O
is O
true O
, O
then O
what O
power O
do O
your O
people O
use O
when O
they O
force O
out O
demons O
? O

So O
your O
own O
people O
will O
prove O
that O
you O
are O
wrong O
. O

But O
I O
use O
the O
power O
of O
God O
's O
Spirit O
to O
force O
out O
demons O
, O
and O
this O
shows O
that O
God O
's O
kingdom O
has O
come O
to O
you O
. O

Whoever O
wants O
to O
enter O
a O
strong O
man O
's O
house O
and O
steal O
his O
things O
must O
first O
tie O
him O
up O
. O

Then O
they O
can O
steal O
the O
things O
from O
his O
house O
. O

Whoever O
is O
not O
with O
me O
is O

So O
I O
tell O
you O

can O
be O

for O
every O

they O
do O

for O
every O

against O
God O

But O
anyone O
who O
speaks O
against O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
will O
not O
be O
forgiven O

You O
can O
even O
speak O
against O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O
and O
be O
forgiven O

But O
anyone O
who O
speaks O
against O

never O

`` O
If O
you O

good O

you O
must O
make O
the O

good O

If O
your O
tree O
is O
not O
good O

it O

You O

You O
are O
so O
evil O

How O
can O
you O
say O
anything O
good O
? O

What O
people O
say O
with O
their O
mouths O
comes O
from O
what O
fills O
their O
hearts O
. O

Those O
who O
are O
good O
have O
good O
things O
saved O
in O
their O
hearts O

That O

why O
they O
say O
good O

But O
those O
who O
are O
evil O
have O
hearts O
full O
of O
evil O

that O
's O
why O
they O
say O
things O
that O
are O
evil O

I O
tell O
you O
that O
everyone O
will O
have O

all O
the O

This O
will O
happen O
on O

day O

judgment O

Your O
words O
will O
be O
used O
to O
judge O
you O

What O
you O
have O
said O
will O
show O
whether O
you O
are O
right O
or O
whether O
you O
are O
guilty O
. O
'' O

Then O
some O
of O
the O
Pharisees O
and O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
answered O
Jesus O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Teacher O
, O
we O
want O
to O
see O
you O
do O
a O
miracle O

a O
sign O
from O

'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
Evil O
and O
sinful O
people O
are O
the O
ones O
who O
want O
to O
see O
a O
miracle O
as O
a O
sign O
. O

But O
no O
miracle O
will O
be O
done O
to O
prove O
anything O
to O
them O
. O

The O
only O
sign O
will O
be O
the O
miracle O
that O
happened O
to O
the O
prophet O
Jonah O
. O

Jonah O
was O
in O
the O
stomach O
of O
the O
big O
fish O
for O
three O
days O
and O
three O
nights O

In O
the O

the O
Son O
of O
Man O
will O
be O
in O
the O

three O
days O

three O
nights O

On O
the O
judgment O

, O
you O

will O
be O

the O
people O
from O
Nineveh O
, O
and O
they O
will O
be O
witnesses O
who O
show O
how O
guilty O
you O
are O

Why O
do O
I O
say O
this O
? O

Because O
when O
Jonah O
preached O
to O
those O
people O
, O
they O
changed O
their O
lives O
. O

And O
you O
are O
listening O

someone O
greater O
than O
Jonah O

you O
refuse O
to O
change O
! O

`` O
On O
the O
judgment O

you O
people O

now O

also O
be O

the O
Queen O
of O
the O
South O

and O
she O
will O
be O
a O
witness O
who O
shows O
how O
guilty O
you O
are O

I O
say O
this O
because O
she O
traveled O
from O
far O
, O
far O
away O
to O
listen O
to O
Solomon O
's O
wise O
teaching O

And O
I O
tell O
you O
that O
someone O
greater O

Solomon O
is O
right O
here O

you O
wo O
n't O
listen O

`` O
When O
an O

dry O

for O
a O

it O

it O

it O

Then O
the O

out O

seven O

all O

Some O

The O

the O

Then O
the O

left O

made O

Is O
it O
right O

But O
Jesus O
knew O
that O
these O

trick O
him O

he O
said O

`` O
You O

a O
silver O

They O
answered O
, O
`` O
It O
is O
Caesar O

Jesus O

`` O

When O
they O
heard O
what O
Jesus O
said O
, O
they O
were O
amazed O

They O
left O
him O

went O
away O

That O
same O
day O
some O
Sadducees O
came O
to O
Jesus O
. O

-LRB- O
Sadducees O
believe O
that O
no O
one O
will O
rise O
from O
death O
. O
-RRB- O

The O
Sadducees O
asked O
Jesus O
a O
question O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Teacher O
, O
Moses O
told O
us O
that O
if O
a O
married O
man O
dies O
and O
had O
no O
children O
, O
his O
brother O
must O
marry O
the O
woman O
. O

Then O
they O
will O
have O
children O
for O
the O
dead O
brother O

There O
were O
seven O
brothers O
among O
us O
. O

The O
first O
brother O
married O
but O
died O
. O

He O
had O
no O
children O

So O
his O
brother O
married O
the O
woman O

Then O
the O
second O
brother O
also O
died O

The O
same O
thing O
happened O
to O
the O
third O
brother O
and O
all O
the O
other O
brothers O

The O
woman O
was O
the O
last O
to O
die O
. O

But O
all O
seven O
men O
had O
married O
her O
. O

So O
when O
people O
rise O
from O
death O
, O
whose O
wife O
will O
she O
be O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
You O
are O
so O
wrong O
! O

You O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
the O
Scriptures O
say O

And O
you O
do O
n't O
know O
anything O
about O
God O
's O
power O

At O
the O
time O
when O
people O
rise O
from O
death O
, O
there O
will O
be O
no O
marriage O

People O
will O
not O
be O
married O
to O
each O
other O
. O

Everyone O
will O
be O
like O
the O
angels O
in O
heaven O
. O

Surely O
you O
have O
read O
what O
God O
said O
to O
you O
about O
people O
rising O
from O
death O

God O
said O
, O
' O
I O
am O
the O
God O
of O
Abraham O
, O
the O
God O
of O
Isaac O
, O
and O
the O
God O
of O
Jacob O
. O
' O

So O
they O
were O
not O
still O
dead O
, O
because O
he O
is O
the O
God O
only O
of O
living O
people O
. O
'' O

When O
the O
people O
heard O
this O
, O
they O
were O
amazed O
at O
Jesus O
' O
teaching O
. O

The O
Pharisees O
learned O
that O
Jesus O
had O
made O
the O
Sadducees O
look O
so O
foolish O
that O
they O
stopped O
trying O
to O
argue O
with O
him O
. O

So O
the O
Pharisees O
had O
a O
meeting O
. O

Then O
one O
of O
them O
, O
an O
expert O
in O
the O
Law O
of O
Moses O
, O
asked O
Jesus O
a O
question O
to O
test O
him O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Teacher O
, O
which O
command O
in O
the O
law O
is O
the O
most O
important O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
' O
Love O
the O
Lord O
your O
God O
with O
all O
your O
heart O
, O
all O
your O
soul O

and O
all O
your O
mind O

' O

This O
is O
the O
first O
and O
most O
important O
command O
. O

And O
the O
second O
command O
is O
like O
the O
first O
: O
' O
Love O
your O
neighbor O
the O
same O
as O
you O
love O
yourself O
. O
' O

All O
the O
law O
and O
the O
writings O
of O
the O
prophets O
take O
their O
meaning O
from O
these O
two O
commands O
. O
'' O

So O
while O
the O
Pharisees O
were O
together O
, O
Jesus O
asked O
them O
a O
question O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
What O
do O
you O
think O
about O
the O
Christ O
? O

Whose O
son O
is O
he O
? O
'' O

The O
Pharisees O
answered O
, O
`` O
The O
Christ O
is O
the O
Son O
of O
David O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Then O
why O
did O
David O
call O
him O
' O
Lord O
' O
? O

David O
was O
speaking O
by O
the O
power O
of O
the O
Spirit O
. O

He O
said O
, O
' O
The O
Lord O
God O
said O
to O
my O
Lord O
: O
Sit O
by O
me O
at O
my O
right O
side O
, O
and O
I O
will O
put O
your O
enemies O
under O
your O
control O
. O
' O

David O
calls O
the O
Christ O
' O
Lord O

' O

So O
how O
can O
he O
be O
David O
's O
son O
? O
'' O

None O
of O
the O
Pharisees O
could O
answer O
Jesus O
' O

question O

And O
after O
that O
day O
, O
no O
one O
was O
brave O
enough O
to O
ask O
him O
any O
more O
questions O
. O

When O
it O
was O
the O
right O
time O
, O
John O
the O
Baptizer O
began O
telling O
people O
a O
message O
from O
God O
. O

This O
was O
out O
in O
the O
desert O
area O
of O
Judea O
. O

John O
said O
, O
`` O
Change O
your O
hearts O

lives O

because O
God O

kingdom O

coming O
soon O

John O
is O
the O
one O
Isaiah O
the O
prophet O
was O
talking O
about O
when O
he O
said O
, O
`` O

in O

John O

clothes O
were O
made O
from O

hair O

he O
had O
a O
leather O
belt O
around O
his O
waist O

For O
food O

ate O
locusts O

wild O
honey O

came O
to O
John O
from O
Jerusalem O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
Judea O
and O
from O
all O
the O
areas O
along O
the O
Jordan O
River O
. O

They O
confessed O
the O
bad O
things O
they O
had O
done O
, O
and O
John O
baptized O
them O
in O
the O
Jordan O
. O

Many O
Pharisees O
and O
Sadducees O
came O
to O
where O
John O
was O
baptizing O
people O
. O

When O
John O
saw O
them O
, O
he O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
are O
all O
snakes O
! O

Who O
warned O
you O
to O
run O
from O
God O
's O
judgment O
that O
is O
coming O
? O

Change O
your O
hearts O
! O

And O
show O
by O
the O
way O
you O
live O
that O
you O
have O
changed O
. O

I O
know O
what O
you O
are O
thinking O
. O

You O
want O
to O
say O
, O
' O
but O
Abraham O
is O
our O
father O
! O
' O

That O
means O
nothing O
. O

I O
tell O
you O
, O
God O
could O
make O
children O
for O
Abraham O
from O
these O
rocks O
. O

The O
ax O
is O
now O
ready O
to O
cut O
down O
the O
trees O
. O

Every O
tree O
that O
does O
not O
produce O
good O
fruit O
will O
be O
cut O
down O
and O
thrown O
into O
the O
fire O
. O

`` O
I O
baptize O
you O
with O
water O
to O
show O
that O
you O
have O
changed O
your O
hearts O
and O
lives O
. O

But O
there O
is O
someone O
coming O
later O
who O
is O
able O
to O
do O
more O
than O
I O
can O
. O

I O
am O
not O
good O
enough O
to O
be O
the O
slave O
who O
takes O
off O
his O
sandals O
. O

He O
will O
baptize O
you O
with O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
and O
with O
fire O
. O

He O
will O
come O
ready O
to O
clean O
the O
grain O
. O

He O
will O
separate O
the O
good O
grain O
from O
the O
straw O
, O
and O
he O
will O
put O
the O
good O
part O
into O
his O
barn O
. O

Then O
he O
will O
burn O
the O
useless O
part O
with O
a O
fire O
that O
can O
not O
be O
stopped O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
came O
from O
Galilee O
to O
the O
Jordan O
River O
. O

He O
came O
to O
John O
, O
wanting O
John O
to O
baptize O
him O
. O

But O
John O
tried O
to O
stop O
him O
. O

John O
said O
, O
`` O
Why O
do O
you O
come O
to O
me O
to O
be O
baptized O
? O

I O
should O
be O
baptized O
by O
you O
! O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
Let O
it O
be O
this O
way O
for O
now O
. O

We O
should O
do O
whatever O
God O
says O
is O
right O
. O
'' O

Then O
John O
agreed O
. O

So O
Jesus O
was O
baptized O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
he O
came O
up O
out O
of O
the O
water O
, O
the O
sky O
opened O
, O
and O
he O
saw O
God O
's O
Spirit O
coming O
down O
on O
him O
like O
a O
dove O
. O

A O
voice O
from O
heaven O
said O
, O
`` O
This O
is O
my O
Son O
, O
the O
one O
I O
love O
. O

I O
am O
very O
pleased O
with O
him O
. O
'' O

`` O
At O
that O
time O
God O
's O
kingdom O
will O
be O
like O
ten O
girls O
who O
went O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
bridegroom O
. O

They O
took O
their O
lamps O
with O
them O
. O

Five O
of O
the O
girls O
were O
foolish O
, O
and O
five O
were O
wise O
. O

The O
foolish O
girls O
took O
their O
lamps O
with O
them O
, O
but O
they O
did O
not O
take O
extra O
oil O
for O
the O
lamps O
. O

The O
wise O
girls O
took O
their O
lamps O
and O
more O
oil O
in O
jars O
. O

When O
the O
bridegroom O
was O
very O
late O
, O
the O
girls O
could O
not O
keep O
their O
eyes O
open O
, O
and O
they O
all O
fell O
asleep O
. O

`` O
At O
midnight O
someone O
announced O
, O
' O
The O
bridegroom O
is O
coming O
! O

Come O
and O
meet O
him O
! O
' O

`` O
Then O
all O
the O
girls O
woke O
up O
. O

They O
made O
their O
lamps O
ready O
. O

But O
the O
foolish O
girls O
said O
to O
the O
wise O
girls O
, O
' O
Give O
us O
some O
of O
your O
oil O
. O

The O
oil O
in O
our O
lamps O
is O
all O
gone O
. O
' O

`` O
The O
wise O
girls O
answered O
, O
' O
No O
! O

The O
oil O
we O
have O
might O
not O
be O
enough O
for O
all O
of O
us O
. O

But O
go O
to O
those O
who O
sell O
oil O
and O
buy O
some O
for O
yourselves O
. O
' O

`` O
So O
the O
foolish O
girls O
went O
to O
buy O
oil O
. O

While O
they O
were O
gone O
, O
the O
bridegroom O
came O
. O

The O
girls O
who O
were O
ready O
went O
in O
with O
the O
bridegroom O
to O
the O
wedding O
feast O
. O

Then O
the O
door O
was O
closed O
and O
locked O
. O

`` O
Later O
, O
the O
other O
girls O
came O
. O

They O
said O
, O
' O
Sir O
, O
sir O
! O

Open O
the O
door O
to O
let O
us O
in O
. O
' O

`` O
But O
the O
bridegroom O
answered O
, O
' O
Certainly O
not O
! O

I O
do O
n't O
even O
know O
you O
. O
' O

`` O
So O
always O
be O
ready O

You O
do O
n't O
know O
the O
day O
or O
the O
time O
when O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O
will O
come O
. O

`` O
At O
that O
time O
God O

will O
also O
be O
like O
a O
man O
leaving O
home O
to O
travel O
to O
another O
place O
for O
a O
visit O
. O

Before O
he O
left O
, O
he O
talked O
with O
his O
servants O

He O
told O
his O
servants O
to O
take O
care O
of O
his O
things O
while O
he O
was O
gone O
. O

He O
decided O
how O
much O
each O
servant O
would O
be O
able O
to O
care O
for O
. O

The O
man O
gave O
one O
servant O
five O
bags O
of O
money O

He O
gave O
another O
servant O
two O
bags O

And O
he O
gave O
a O
third O
servant O
one O
bag O
. O

Then O
he O
left O

The O
servant O
who O
got O
five O
bags O
went O
quickly O
to O
invest O
the O
money O
. O

Those O
five O
bags O
of O
money O
earned O
five O
more O
. O

It O
was O
the O
same O
with O
the O
servant O
who O
had O
two O
bags O
. O

That O
servant O
invested O
the O
money O
and O
earned O
two O
more O
. O

But O
the O
servant O
who O
got O
one O
bag O
of O
money O
went O
away O
and O
dug O
a O
hole O
in O
the O
ground O

Then O
he O
hid O
his O
master O

money O
in O
the O
hole O

`` O
After O
a O
long O
time O
the O
master O
came O
home O

He O
asked O
the O
servants O
what O
they O
did O
with O
his O
money O

The O
servant O
who O
got O
five O
bags O
brought O
that O
amount O
and O
five O
more O
bags O
of O
money O
to O
the O
master O

The O
servant O
said O
, O
' O

you O
trusted O
me O

I O
used O

five O

You O
did O
well O
with O
that O
small O

you O

Then O
, O
when O
I O
came O
home O

I O
would O

would O

wanted O
. O

Herodias O
told O
her O
daughter O
what O
to O
ask O
for O
. O

So O
she O
said O
to O
Herod O
, O
`` O
Give O
me O
the O
head O
of O
John O
the O
Baptizer O
here O
on O
this O
plate O
. O
'' O

King O
Herod O
was O
very O
sad O
. O

But O
he O
had O
promised O
to O
give O
the O
daughter O
anything O
she O
wanted O
. O

And O
the O
people O
eating O
with O
Herod O
had O
heard O
his O
promise O
. O

So O
he O
ordered O
what O
she O
asked O
to O
be O
done O
. O

He O
sent O
men O
to O
the O
prison O
, O
where O
they O
cut O
off O
John O
's O
head O
. O

And O
the O
men O
brought O
John O
's O
head O
on O
a O
plate O
and O
gave O
it O
to O
the O
girl O
. O

Then O
she O
took O
the O
head O
to O
her O
mother O
, O
Herodias O
. O

John O
's O
followers O
came O
and O
got O
his O
body O
and O
buried O
it O
. O

Then O
they O
went O
and O
told O
Jesus O
what O
happened O
. O

When O
Jesus O
heard O
what O
happened O
to O
John O
, O
he O
left O
in O
a O
boat O
. O

He O
went O
alone O
to O
a O
place O
where O
no O
one O
lived O
. O

But O
the O
people O
heard O
that O
Jesus O
had O
left O
. O

So O
they O
left O
their O
towns O
and O
followed O
him O
. O

They O
went O
by O
land O
to O
the O
same O
place O
he O
went O
. O

When O
Jesus O
got O
out O
of O
the O
boat O
, O
he O
saw O
a O
large O
crowd O
of O
people O
. O

He O
felt O
sorry O
for O
them O
, O
and O
he O
healed O
the O
ones O
who O
were O
sick O
. O

Late O
that O
afternoon O
, O
the O
followers O
came O
to O
Jesus O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
No O
one O
lives O
in O
this O
place O
. O

And O
it O
is O
already O
late O
. O

Send O
the O
people O
away O
so O
they O
can O
go O
to O
the O
towns O
and O
buy O
food O
for O
themselves O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
people O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
go O
away O
. O

You O
give O
them O
some O
food O
to O
eat O
. O
'' O

The O
followers O
answered O
, O
`` O
But O
we O
have O
only O
five O
loaves O
of O
bread O
and O
two O
fish O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Bring O
the O
bread O
and O
the O
fish O
to O
me O
. O
'' O

Then O
he O
told O
the O
people O
to O
sit O
down O
on O
the O
grass O
. O

He O
took O
the O
five O
loaves O
of O
bread O
and O
the O
two O
fish O
. O

He O
looked O
into O
the O
sky O
and O
thanked O
God O
for O
the O
food O
. O

Then O
he O
broke O
the O
bread O
into O
pieces O
, O
which O
he O
gave O
to O
the O
followers O
, O
and O
they O
gave O
the O
food O
to O
the O
people O
. O

Everyone O
ate O
until O
they O
were O
full O
. O

When O
they O
finished O
eating O
, O
the O
followers O
filled O
twelve O
baskets O
with O
the O
pieces O
of O
food O
that O
were O
not O
eaten O
. O

There O
were O
about O
5000 O
men O
there O
who O
ate O
. O

There O
were O
also O
women O
and O
children O
who O
ate O
. O

Then O
Jesus O
made O
the O
followers O
get O
into O
the O
boat O
. O

He O
told O
them O
to O
go O
to O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
lake O
. O

He O
said O
he O
would O
come O
later O
. O

He O
stayed O
there O
to O
tell O
everyone O
they O
could O
go O
home O
. O

After O
Jesus O
said O
goodbye O
to O
the O
people O
, O
he O
went O
up O
into O
the O
hills O
by O
himself O
to O
pray O
. O

It O
was O
late O
, O
and O
he O
was O
there O
alone O
. O

By O
this O
time O
the O
boat O
was O
already O
a O
long O
way O
from O
shore O
. O

Since O
the O
wind O
was O
blowing O
against O
it O
, O
the O
boat O
was O
having O
trouble O
because O
of O
the O
waves O
. O

Between O
three O
and O
six O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
Jesus O
' O
followers O
were O
still O
in O
the O
boat O
. O

Jesus O
came O
to O
them O
. O

He O
was O
walking O
on O
the O
water O
. O

When O
they O
saw O
him O
walking O
on O
the O
water O
, O
it O
scared O
them O
. O

`` O
It O
's O
a O
ghost O
! O
'' O

they O
said O
, O
screaming O
in O
fear O
. O

But O
Jesus O
quickly O
spoke O
to O
them O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
worry O
! O

It O
's O
me O
! O

Do O
n't O
be O
afraid O
. O
'' O

Peter O
said O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
if O
that O
is O
really O
you O
, O
tell O
me O
to O
come O
to O
you O
on O
the O
water O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Come O
, O
Peter O
. O
'' O

Then O
Peter O
left O
the O
boat O
and O
walked O
on O
the O
water O
to O
Jesus O
. O

But O
while O
Peter O
was O
walking O
on O
the O
water O
, O
he O
saw O
the O
wind O
and O
the O
waves O
. O

He O
was O
afraid O
and O
began O
sinking O
into O
the O
water O
. O

He O
shouted O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
save O
me O
! O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
caught O
Peter O
with O
his O
hand O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Your O
faith O
is O
small O
. O

Why O
did O
you O
doubt O
? O
'' O

After O
Peter O
and O
Jesus O
were O
in O
the O
boat O
, O
the O
wind O
stopped O
. O

Then O
the O
followers O
in O
the O
boat O
worshiped O
Jesus O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
really O
are O
the O
Son O
of O
God O
. O
'' O

After O
they O
crossed O
the O
lake O
, O
they O
came O
to O
the O
shore O
at O
Gennesaret O
. O

Some O
men O
there O
saw O
Jesus O
and O
knew O
who O
he O
was O
. O

So O
they O
sent O
word O
to O
the O
other O
people O
throughout O
that O
area O
that O
Jesus O
had O
come O
. O

The O
people O
brought O
all O
their O
sick O
people O
to O
him O
. O

They O
begged O
Jesus O
to O
let O
them O
only O
touch O
the O
edge O
of O
his O
coat O
to O
be O
healed O
. O

And O
all O
the O
sick O
people O
who O
touched O
his O
coat O
were O
healed O
. O

Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
you O
know O
that O
our O
visit O
to O
you O
was O
not O
a O
failure O
. O

Before O
we O
came O
to O
you O
, O
people O
in O
Philippi O
abused O
us O
with O
insults O
and O
made O
us O
suffer O
. O

You O
know O
all O
about O
that O
. O

And O
then O
, O
when O
we O
came O
to O
you O
, O
many O
people O
there O
caused O
trouble O
for O
us O
. O

But O
our O
God O
gave O
us O
the O
courage O
we O
needed O
to O
tell O
you O
his O
Good O
News O
. O

When O
we O
encourage O
people O
to O
believe O
the O
Good O
News O
, O
it O
's O
not O
out O
of O
wrong O
motives O
. O

We O
are O
not O
trying O
to O
trick O
or O
fool O
anyone O
. O

No O
, O
it O
was O
God O
who O
gave O
us O
this O
work O
but O
only O
after O
he O
tested O
us O
and O
saw O
that O
we O
could O
be O
trusted O
to O
do O
it O
. O

So O
when O
we O
speak O
, O
we O
are O
not O
trying O
to O
please O
people O
. O

We O
are O
only O
trying O
to O
please O
God O
. O

He O
is O
the O
one O
who O
can O
see O
what O
is O
in O
our O
hearts O
. O

You O
know O
that O
we O
never O
tried O
to O
influence O
you O
by O
saying O
nice O
things O
about O
you O
. O

We O
were O
not O
trying O
to O
get O
your O
money O
. O

We O
had O
no O
greed O
to O
hide O
from O
you O
. O

God O
knows O
that O
this O
is O
true O
. O

We O
were O
not O
looking O
for O
praise O
from O
people O
-- O
not O
from O
you O
or O
anyone O
else O
. O

When O
we O
were O
with O
you O
, O
as O
apostles O
of O
Christ O
we O
could O
have O
used O
our O
authority O
to O
make O
you O
help O
us O
. O

But O
we O
were O
very O
gentle O
with O
you O
. O

We O
were O
like O
a O
mother O
caring O
for O
her O
little O
children O
. O

We O
loved O
you O
very O
much O
, O
so O
we O
were O
happy O
to O
share O
God O
's O
Good O
News O
with O
you O
. O

But O
not O
only O
that O
-- O
we O
were O
also O
happy O
to O
share O
even O
our O
own O
lives O
with O
you O
. O

Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
I O
know O
that O
you O
remember O
how O
hard O
we O
worked O
. O

We O
worked O
night O
and O
day O
to O
support O
ourselves O
, O
so O
that O
we O
would O
not O
be O
a O
burden O
to O
anyone O
while O
we O
did O
the O
work O
of O
telling O
you O
God O
's O
Good O
News O
. O

When O
we O
were O
there O
with O
you O
believers O
, O
we O
were O
pure O
, O
honest O
, O
and O
without O
fault O
in O
the O
way O
we O
lived O
. O

You O
know O
, O
just O
as O
God O
does O
, O
that O
this O
is O
true O
. O

You O
know O
that O
we O
treated O
each O
one O
of O
you O
the O
way O
a O
father O
treats O
his O
own O
children O
. O

We O
encouraged O
you O
, O
we O
comforted O
you O
, O
and O
we O
told O
you O
to O
live O
good O
lives O
for O
God O
. O

He O
calls O
you O
to O
be O
part O
of O
his O
glorious O
kingdom O
. O

Also O
, O
we O
always O
thank O
God O
because O
of O
the O
way O
you O
accepted O
his O
message O
. O

You O
heard O
it O
and O
accepted O
it O
as O
God O
's O
message O
, O
not O
our O
own O
. O

And O
it O
really O
is O
God O
's O
message O
. O

And O
it O
works O
in O
you O
who O
believe O
. O

Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
you O
are O
like O
God O
's O
churches O
in O
Christ O
Jesus O
that O
are O
in O
Judea O
. O

You O
were O
treated O
badly O
by O
your O
own O
people O
, O
just O
as O
God O
's O
people O
in O
Judea O
were O
treated O
badly O
by O
the O
other O
Jews O
there O
. O

Those O
Jews O
killed O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
and O
the O
prophets O
. O

And O
they O
forced O
us O
to O
leave O
their O
country O
. O

They O
are O
not O
pleasing O
to O
God O
, O
and O
they O
are O
against O
everyone O
else O
. O

And O
they O
are O
trying O
to O
stop O
us O
from O
teaching O
those O
who O
are O
not O
Jews O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
want O
them O
to O
be O
saved O
. O

But O
they O
are O
just O
adding O
more O
and O
more O
sins O
to O
the O
ones O
they O
already O
have O
. O

Now O
the O
time O
has O
come O
for O
them O
to O
suffer O
God O
's O
anger O
. O

Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
we O
were O
separated O
from O
you O
for O
a O
short O
time O
. O

But O
even O
though O
we O
were O
not O
there O
, O
our O
thoughts O
were O
still O
with O
you O
. O

We O
wanted O
very O
much O
to O
see O
you O
, O
and O
we O
tried O
very O
hard O
to O
do O
this O
. O

Yes O
, O
we O
wanted O
to O
come O
to O
you O
. O

I O
, O
Paul O
, O
tried O
more O
than O
once O
to O
come O
, O
but O
Satan O
stopped O
us O
. O

You O
are O
our O
hope O
, O
our O
joy O
, O
and O
the O
crown O
we O
will O
be O
proud O
of O
when O
our O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
comes O
. O

You O
bring O
us O
honor O
and O
joy O
. O

Now O
, O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
we O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
write O
to O
you O
about O
times O
and O
dates O
. O

You O
know O
very O
well O
that O
the O
day O
when O
the O
Lord O
comes O
again O
will O
be O
a O
surprise O
, O
like O
a O
thief O
who O
comes O
at O
night O
. O

People O
will O
say O
, O
`` O
We O
have O
peace O
and O
we O
are O
safe O
. O
'' O

At O
that O
time O
destruction O
will O
come O
to O
them O
quickly O
, O
like O
the O
pains O
of O
a O
woman O
giving O
birth O
. O

And O
those O
people O
will O
not O
escape O
. O

But O
you O
, O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
are O
not O
living O
in O
darkness O
. O

And O
so O
that O
day O
will O
not O
surprise O
you O
like O
a O
thief O
. O

You O
are O
all O
people O
who O
belong O
to O
the O
light O
. O

You O
belong O
to O
the O
day O
. O

We O
do O
n't O
belong O
to O
the O
night O
or O
to O
darkness O
. O

So O
we O
should O
not O
be O
like O
other O
people O
. O

We O
should O
not O
be O
sleeping O
. O

We O
should O
be O
awake O
and O
have O
self O
- O
control O
. O

People O
who O
sleep O
, O
sleep O
at O
night O
. O

People O
who O
drink O
too O
much O
, O
drink O
at O
night O
. O

But O
we O
belong O
to O
the O
day O
, O
so O
we O
should O
control O
ourselves O
. O

We O
should O
wear O
faith O
and O
love O
to O
protect O
us O
. O

And O
the O
hope O
of O
salvation O
should O
be O
our O
helmet O
. O

God O
did O
not O
choose O
us O
to O
suffer O
his O
anger O
. O

God O
chose O
us O
to O
have O
salvation O
through O
our O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

Jesus O
died O
for O
us O
so O
that O
we O
can O
live O
together O
with O
him O
. O

It O
is O
not O
important O
if O
we O
are O
alive O
or O
dead O
when O
Jesus O
comes O
. O

So O
encourage O
each O
other O
and O
help O
each O
other O
grow O
stronger O
in O
faith O
, O
just O
as O
you O
are O
already O
doing O
. O

Now O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
we O
ask O
you O
to O
recognize O
the O
value O
of O
those O
who O
work O
hard O
among O
you O
-- O
those O
who O
, O
as O
followers O
of O
the O
Lord O
, O
care O
for O
you O
and O
tell O
you O
how O
to O
live O
. O

Show O
them O
the O
highest O
respect O
and O
love O
because O
of O
the O
work O
they O
do O
. O

Live O
in O
peace O
with O
each O
other O
. O

We O
ask O
you O
, O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
to O
warn O
those O
who O
will O
not O
work O
. O

Encourage O
those O
who O
are O
afraid O
. O

Help O
those O
who O
are O
weak O
. O

Be O
patient O
with O
everyone O
. O

Be O
sure O
that O
no O
one O
pays O
back O
wrong O
for O
wrong O
. O

But O
always O
try O
to O
do O
what O
is O
good O
for O
each O
other O
and O
for O
all O
people O
. O

Always O
be O
full O
of O
joy O
. O

Never O
stop O
praying O
. O

Whatever O
happens O
, O
always O
be O
thankful O
. O

This O
is O
how O
God O
wants O
you O
to O
live O
in O
Christ O
Jesus O
. O

Do O
n't O
stop O
the O
work O
of O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
. O

Do O
n't O
treat O
prophecy O
like O
something O
that O
is O
not O
important O
. O

But O
test O
everything O
. O

Keep O
what O
is O
good O
, O
and O
stay O
away O
from O
everything O
that O
is O
evil O
. O

We O
pray O
that O
God O
himself O
, O
the O
God O
of O
peace O
, O
will O
make O
you O
pure O
-- O
belonging O
only O
to O
him O
. O

We O
pray O
that O
your O
whole O
self O
-- O
spirit O
, O
soul O
, O
and O
body O
-- O

Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
God O
loves O
you O
. O

And O
we O
know O
that O
he O
has O
chosen O
you O
to O
be O
his O
people O
. O

When O
we O
brought O
the O
Good O
News O
to O
you O
, O
we O
came O
with O
more O
than O
words O
. O

We O
brought O
that O
Good O
News O
with O
power O
, O
with O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
, O
and O
with O
the O
sure O
knowledge O
that O
it O
was O
true O
. O

Also O
you O
know O
how O
we O
lived O
when O
we O
were O
with O
you O
. O

We O
lived O
that O
way O
to O
help O
you O
. O

And O
you O
became O
like O
us O
and O
like O
the O
Lord O
. O

You O
suffered O
much O
, O
but O
still O
you O
accepted O
the O
teaching O
with O
joy O
. O

The O
Holy O
Spirit O
gave O
you O
that O
joy O
. O

You O
became O
an O
example O
to O
all O
the O
believers O
in O
Macedonia O
and O
Achaia O
. O

The O
Lord O
's O
teaching O
has O
spread O
from O
you O
throughout O
Greece O
and O
beyond O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
your O
faith O
in O
God O
has O
become O
known O
everywhere O
, O
so O
we O
never O
have O
to O
tell O
anyone O
about O
it O
. O

People O
everywhere O
are O
already O
telling O
the O
story O
about O
the O
good O
way O
you O
accepted O
us O
when O
we O
were O
there O
with O
you O
. O

They O
tell O
about O
how O
you O
stopped O
worshiping O
idols O
and O
changed O
to O
serve O
the O
living O
and O
true O
God O
. O

And O
you O
began O
waiting O
for O
God O
's O
Son O
to O
come O
from O
heaven O
-- O
the O
Son O
God O
raised O
from O
death O
. O

He O
is O
Jesus O
, O
who O
saves O
us O
from O
God O
's O
angry O
judgment O
that O
is O
coming O
. O

We O
could O
not O
come O
to O
you O
, O
but O
it O
was O
very O
hard O
to O
wait O
any O
longer O
. O

So O
we O
decided O
to O
send O
Timothy O
to O
you O
and O
stay O
in O
Athens O
alone O
. O

Timothy O
is O
our O
brother O
. O

He O
works O
with O
us O
for O
God O
to O
tell O
people O
the O
Good O
News O
about O
Christ O
. O

We O
sent O
Timothy O
to O
strengthen O
and O
encourage O
you O
in O
your O
faith O
. O

We O
sent O
him O
so O
that O
none O
of O
you O
would O
be O
upset O
by O
the O
troubles O
we O
have O
now O
. O

You O
yourselves O
know O
that O
we O
must O
have O
these O
troubles O
. O

Even O
when O
we O
were O
with O
you O
, O
we O
told O
you O
that O
we O
would O
all O
have O
to O
suffer O
. O

And O
you O
know O
that O
it O
happened O
just O
as O
we O
said O
. O

This O
is O
why O
I O
sent O
Timothy O
to O
you O
, O
so O
that O
I O
could O
know O
about O
your O
faith O
. O

I O
sent O
him O
when O
I O
could O
not O
wait O
anymore O
. O

I O
was O
afraid O
that O
the O
devil O
who O
tempts O
people O
might O
have O
defeated O
you O
with O
temptations O
. O

Then O
our O
hard O
work O
would O
have O
been O
wasted O
. O

But O
now O
Timothy O
has O
come O
back O
from O
his O
visit O
with O
you O
and O
told O
us O
good O
news O
about O
your O
faith O
and O
love O
. O

He O
told O
us O
that O
you O
always O
remember O
us O
in O
a O
good O
way O
. O

He O
told O
us O
that O
you O
want O
very O
much O
to O
see O
us O
again O
. O

And O
it O
is O
the O
same O
with O
us O
-- O
we O
want O
very O
much O
to O
see O
you O
. O

So O
, O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
we O
are O
encouraged O
about O
you O
because O
of O
your O
faith O
. O

We O
have O
much O
trouble O
and O
suffering O
, O
but O
still O
we O
are O
encouraged O
. O

Our O
life O
is O
really O
full O
if O
you O
stand O
strong O
in O
the O
Lord O
. O

We O
have O
so O
much O
joy O
before O
our O
God O
because O
of O
you O
! O

So O
we O
thank O
God O
for O
you O
. O

But O
we O
can O
not O
thank O
him O
enough O
for O
all O
the O
joy O
we O
feel O
. O

Night O
and O
day O
we O
continue O
praying O
with O
all O
our O
heart O
that O
we O
can O
come O
there O
and O
see O
you O
again O
. O

We O
want O
to O
give O
you O
everything O
you O
need O
to O
make O
your O
faith O
strong O
. O

We O
pray O
that O
our O
God O
and O
Father O
and O
our O
Lord O
Jesus O
will O
prepare O
the O
way O
for O
us O
to O
come O
to O
you O
. O

We O
pray O
that O
the O
Lord O
will O
make O
your O
love O
grow O
. O

We O
pray O
that O
he O
will O
give O
you O
more O
and O
more O
love O
for O
each O
other O
and O
for O
all O
people O
. O

We O
pray O
that O
you O
will O
love O
everyone O
in O
the O
same O
way O
we O
love O
you O
. O

This O
will O
strengthen O
your O
desire O
to O
do O
what O
is O
right O
, O
and O
you O
will O
be O
holy O
and O
without O
fault O
before O
our O
God O
and O
Father O
when O
our O
Lord O
Jesus O
comes O
with O
all O
his O
holy O
people O
. O

Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
now O
I O
have O
some O
other O
things O
to O
tell O
you O
. O

We O
taught O
you O
how O
to O
live O
in O
a O
way O
that O
will O
please O
God O
. O

And O
you O
are O
living O
that O
way O
. O

Now O
we O
ask O
and O
encourage O
you O
in O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
to O
live O
that O
way O
more O
and O
more O
. O

You O
know O
all O
that O
we O
told O
you O
to O
do O
by O
the O
authority O
of O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
. O

God O
wants O
you O
to O
be O
holy O
. O

He O
wants O
you O
to O
stay O
away O
from O
sexual O
sins O
. O

God O
wants O
each O
one O
of O
you O
to O
learn O
to O
control O
your O
own O
body O
. O

Use O
your O
body O
in O
a O
way O
that O
is O
holy O
and O
that O
gives O
honor O
to O
God O
. O

Do O
n't O
let O
your O
sexual O
desires O
control O
you O
like O
the O
people O
who O
do O
n't O
know O
God O
. O

Never O
wrong O
any O
of O
your O
fellow O
believers O
or O
cheat O
them O
in O
this O
way O
. O

The O
Lord O
will O
punish O
those O
who O
do O
that O
. O

We O
have O
already O
told O
you O
this O
and O
warned O
you O
about O
it O
. O

God O
chose O
us O
to O
be O
holy O
. O

He O
does O
not O
want O
us O
to O
live O
in O
sin O
. O

So O
anyone O
who O
refuses O
to O
obey O
this O
teaching O
is O
refusing O
to O
obey O
God O
, O
not O
us O
. O

And O
God O
is O
the O
one O
who O
gives O
you O
his O
Holy O
Spirit O
. O

We O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
write O
to O
you O
about O
having O
love O
for O
your O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
in O
Christ O
. O

God O
has O
already O
taught O
you O
to O
love O
each O
other O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
you O
love O
the O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
in O
all O
of O
Macedonia O
. O

We O
encourage O
you O
now O
, O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
to O
show O
your O
love O
more O
and O
more O
. O

Do O
all O
you O
can O
to O
live O
a O
peaceful O
life O
. O

Mind O
your O
own O
business O
, O
and O
earn O
your O
own O
living O
, O
as O
we O
told O
you O
before O
. O

If O
you O
do O
these O
things O
, O
then O
those O
who O
are O
not O
believers O
will O
respect O
the O
way O
you O
live O
. O

And O
you O
will O
not O
have O
to O
depend O
on O
others O
for O
what O
you O
need O
. O

Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
we O
want O
you O
to O
know O
about O
those O
who O
have O
died O
. O

We O
do O
n't O
want O
you O
to O
be O
sad O
like O
other O
people O
-- O
those O
who O
have O
no O
hope O
. O

We O
believe O
that O
Jesus O
died O
, O
but O
we O
also O
believe O
that O
he O
rose O
again O
. O

So O
we O
believe O
that O
God O
will O
raise O
to O
life O
through O
Jesus O
any O
who O
have O
died O
and O
bring O
them O
together O
with O
him O
when O
he O
comes O
. O

What O
we O
tell O
you O
now O
is O
the O
Lord O
's O
own O
message O
. O

Those O
of O
us O
who O
are O
still O
living O
when O
the O
Lord O
comes O
again O
will O
join O
him O
, O
but O
not O
before O
those O
who O
have O
already O
died O
. O

The O
Lord O
himself O
will O
come O
down O
from O
heaven O
with O
a O
loud O
command O
, O
with O
the O
voice O
of O
the O
archangel O
, O
and O
with O
the O
trumpet O
call O
of O
God O
. O

And O
the O
people O
who O
have O
died O
and O
were O
in O
Christ O
will O
rise O
first O
. O

After O
that O
, O
we O
who O
are O
still O
alive O
at O
that O
time O
will O
be O
gathered O
up O
with O
those O
who O
have O
died O
. O

We O
will O
be O
taken O
up O
in O
the O
clouds O
and O
meet O
the O
Lord O
in O
the O
air O
. O

And O
we O
will O
be O
with O
the O
Lord O
forever O
. O

So O
encourage O
each O
other O
with O
these O
words O
. O

You O
rich O
people O
, O
listen O
! O

Cry O
and O
be O
very O
sad O
because O
much O
trouble O
will O
come O
to O
you O
. O

Your O
riches O
will O
rot O
and O
be O
worth O
nothing O
. O

Your O
clothes O
will O
be O
eaten O
by O
moths O
. O

Your O
gold O
and O
silver O
will O
rust O
, O
and O
that O
rust O
will O
be O
a O
proof O
that O
you O
were O
wrong O
. O

That O
rust O
will O
eat O
your O
bodies O
like O
fire O
. O

You O
saved O
your O
treasure O
in O
the O
last O
days O
. O

People O
worked O
in O
your O
fields O
, O
but O
you O
did O
not O
pay O
them O
. O

They O
are O
crying O
out O
against O
you O
. O

They O
harvested O
your O
crops O
. O

Now O
the O
Lord O
All O
- O
Powerful O
has O
heard O
their O
cries O
. O

Your O
life O
on O
earth O
was O
full O
of O
rich O
living O
. O

You O
pleased O
yourselves O
with O
everything O
you O
wanted O
. O

You O
made O
yourselves O
fat O
, O
like O
an O
animal O
ready O
for O
the O
day O
of O
slaughter O
. O

You O
showed O
no O
mercy O
to O
good O
people O
. O

They O
were O
not O
against O
you O
, O
but O
you O
killed O
them O
. O

Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
be O
patient O
; O
the O
Lord O
will O
come O
. O

So O
be O
patient O
until O
that O
time O
. O

Look O
at O
the O
farmers O
. O

They O
have O
to O
be O
patient O
. O

They O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
their O
valuable O
crop O
to O
grow O
and O
produce O
a O
harvest O
. O

They O
wait O
patiently O
for O
the O
first O
rain O
and O
the O
last O
rain O
. O

You O
must O
be O
patient O
too O
. O

Never O
stop O
hoping O
. O

The O
Lord O
is O
coming O
soon O
. O

Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
do O
n't O
complain O
against O
each O
other O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
stop O
complaining O
, O
you O
will O
be O
judged O
guilty O
. O

And O
the O
Judge O
is O
ready O
to O
come O
! O

Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
follow O
the O
example O
of O
the O
prophets O
who O
spoke O
for O
the O
Lord O
. O

They O
suffered O
many O
bad O
things O
, O
but O
they O
were O
patient O
. O

And O
we O
say O
that O
those O
who O
accepted O
their O
troubles O
with O
patience O
now O
have O
God O
's O
blessing O
. O

You O
have O
heard O
about O
Job O
's O
patience O
. O

You O
know O
that O
after O
all O
his O
troubles O
, O
the O
Lord O
helped O
him O
. O

This O
shows O
that O
the O
Lord O
is O
full O
of O
mercy O
and O
is O
kind O
. O

My O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
it O
is O
very O
important O
that O
you O
not O
use O
an O
oath O
when O
you O
make O
a O
promise O
. O

Do O
n't O
use O
the O
name O
of O
heaven O
, O
earth O
, O
or O
anything O
else O
to O
prove O
what O
you O
say O
. O

When O
you O
mean O
yes O
, O
say O
only O
`` O
yes O
. O
'' O

When O
you O
mean O
no O
, O
say O
only O
`` O
no O
. O
'' O

Do O
this O
so O
that O
you O
will O
not O
be O
judged O
guilty O
. O

Are O
you O
having O
troubles O
? O

You O
should O
pray O
. O

Are O
you O
happy O
? O

You O
should O
sing O
. O

Are O
you O
sick O
? O

Ask O
the O
elders O
of O
the O
church O
to O
come O
and O
rub O
oil O
on O
you O
in O
the O
name O
of O
the O
Lord O
and O
pray O
for O
you O
. O

If O
such O
a O
prayer O
is O
offered O
in O
faith O
, O
it O
will O
heal O
anyone O
who O
is O
sick O
. O

The O
Lord O
will O
heal O
them O
. O

And O
if O
they O
have O
sinned O
, O
he O
will O
forgive O
them O
. O

So O
always O
tell O
each O
other O
the O
wrong O
things O
you O
have O
done O
. O

Then O
pray O
for O
each O
other O
. O

Do O
this O
so O
that O
God O
can O
heal O
you O
. O

Anyone O
who O
lives O
the O
way O
God O
wants O
can O
pray O
, O
and O
great O
things O
will O
happen O
. O

Elijah O
was O
a O
person O
just O
like O
us O
. O

He O
prayed O
that O
it O
would O
not O
rain O
. O

And O
it O
did O
not O
rain O
on O
the O
land O
for O
three O
and O
a O
half O
years O
! O

Then O
Elijah O
prayed O
that O
it O
would O
rain O
. O

And O
the O
rain O
came O
down O
from O
the O
sky O
, O
and O
the O
land O
grew O
crops O
again O
. O

My O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
if O
anyone O
wanders O
away O
from O
the O
truth O
and O
someone O
helps O
that O
person O
come O
back O
, O
remember O
this O
: O
Anyone O
who O
brings O
a O
sinner O
back O
from O
the O
wrong O
way O
will O
save O
that O
person O
from O
eternal O
death O
and O
cause O
many O
sins O
to O
be O
forgiven O
. O

Do O
you O
know O
where O
your O
fights O
and O
arguments O
come O
from O
? O

They O
come O
from O
the O
selfish O
desires O
that O
make O
war O
inside O
you O
. O

You O
want O
things O
, O
but O
you O
do O
n't O
get O
them O
. O

So O
you O
kill O
and O
are O
jealous O
of O
others O
. O

But O
you O
still O
can O
not O
get O
what O
you O
want O
. O

So O
you O
argue O
and O
fight O
. O

You O
do O
n't O
get O
what O
you O
want O
because O
you O
do O
n't O
ask O
God O
. O

Or O
when O
you O
ask O
, O
you O
do O
n't O
receive O
anything O
, O
because O
the O
reason O
you O
ask O
is O
wrong O
. O

You O
only O
want O
to O
use O
it O
for O
your O
own O
pleasure O
. O

You O
people O
are O
not O
faithful O
to O
God O
! O

You O
should O
know O
that O
loving O
what O
the O
world O
has O
is O
the O
same O
as O
hating O
God O
. O

So O
anyone O
who O
wants O
to O
be O
friends O
with O
this O
evil O
world O
becomes O
God O
's O
enemy O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
the O
Scriptures O
mean O
nothing O
? O

The O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
The O
Spirit O
God O
made O
to O
live O
in O
us O
wants O
us O
only O
for O
himself O
. O
'' O

But O
the O
kindness O
God O
shows O
is O
greater O
. O

As O
the O
Scripture O
says O
, O
`` O
God O
is O
against O
the O
proud O
, O
but O
he O
is O
kind O
to O
the O
humble O
. O
'' O

So O
give O
yourselves O
to O
God O
. O

Stand O
against O
the O
devil O
, O
and O
he O
will O
run O
away O
from O
you O
. O

Come O
near O
to O
God O
and O
he O
will O
come O
near O
to O
you O
. O

You O
are O
sinners O
, O
so O
clean O
sin O
out O
of O
your O
lives O
. O

You O
are O
trying O
to O
follow O
God O
and O
the O
world O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

Make O
your O
thinking O
pure O
. O

Be O
sad O
, O
be O
sorry O
, O
and O
cry O
! O

Change O
your O
laughter O
into O
crying O
. O

Change O
your O
joy O
into O
sadness O
. O

Be O
humble O
before O
the O
Lord O
, O
and O
he O
will O
make O
you O
great O
. O

Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
do O
n't O
say O
anything O
against O
each O
other O
. O

If O
you O
criticize O
your O
brother O
or O
sister O
in O
Christ O
or O
judge O
them O
, O
you O
are O
criticizing O
and O
judging O
the O
law O
they O
follow O
. O

And O
when O
you O
are O
judging O
the O
law O
, O
you O
are O
not O
a O
follower O
of O
the O
law O
. O

You O
have O
become O
a O
judge O
. O

God O
is O
the O
one O
who O
gave O
us O
the O
law O
, O
and O
he O
is O
the O
Judge O
. O

He O
is O
the O
only O
one O
who O
can O
save O
and O
destroy O
. O

So O
it O
is O
not O
right O
for O
you O
to O
judge O
anyone O
. O

Some O
of O
you O
say O
, O
`` O
Today O
or O
tomorrow O
we O
will O
go O
to O
some O
city O
. O

We O
will O
stay O
there O
a O
year O
, O
do O
business O
, O
and O
make O
money O
. O
'' O

Listen O
, O
think O
about O
this O
: O
You O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
will O
happen O
tomorrow O
. O

Your O
life O
is O
like O
a O
fog O
. O

You O
can O
see O
it O
for O
a O
short O
time O
, O
but O
then O
it O
goes O
away O
. O

So O
you O
should O
say O
, O
`` O
If O
the O
Lord O
wants O
, O
we O
will O
live O
and O
do O
this O
or O
that O
. O
'' O

But O
now O
you O
are O
proud O
and O
boast O
about O
yourself O
. O

All O
such O
boasting O
is O
wrong O
. O

If O
you O
fail O
to O
do O
what O
you O
know O
is O
right O
, O
you O
are O
sinning O
. O

My O
dear O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
you O
are O
believers O
in O
our O
glorious O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

So O
do O
n't O
treat O
some O
people O
better O
than O
others O
. O

Suppose O
someone O
comes O
into O
your O
meeting O
wearing O
very O
nice O
clothes O
and O
a O
gold O
ring O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
a O
poor O
person O
comes O
in O
wearing O
old O
, O
dirty O
clothes O
. O

You O
show O
special O
attention O
to O
the O
person O
wearing O
nice O
clothes O
. O

You O
say O
, O
`` O
Sit O
here O
in O
this O
good O
seat O
. O
'' O

But O
you O
say O
to O
the O
poor O
person O
, O
`` O
Stand O
there O
! O
'' O

or O
`` O
Sit O
on O
the O
floor O
by O
our O
feet O
! O
'' O

Does O
n't O
this O
show O
that O
you O
think O
some O
people O
are O
more O
important O
than O
others O
? O

You O
set O
yourselves O
up O
as O
judges O
-- O
judges O
who O
make O
bad O
decisions O
. O

Listen O
, O
my O
dear O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
. O

God O
chose O
the O
poor O
people O
in O
the O
world O
to O
be O
rich O
in O
faith O
. O

He O
chose O
them O
to O
receive O
the O
kingdom O
God O
promised O
to O
those O
who O
love O
him O
. O

But O
you O
show O
no O
respect O
to O
those O
who O
are O
poor O
. O

And O
you O
know O
that O
the O
rich O
are O
the O
ones O
who O
always O
try O
to O
control O
your O
lives O
. O

And O
they O
are O
the O
ones O
who O
take O
you O
to O
court O
. O

And O
the O
rich O
are O
the O
ones O
who O
insult O
the O
wonderful O
name O
of O
Christ O
, O
the O
name O
by O
which O
you O
are O
known O
. O

One O
law O
rules O
over O
all O
other O
laws O
. O

This O
royal O
law O
is O
found O
in O
the O
Scriptures O
: O
`` O
Love O
your O
neighbor O
the O
same O
as O
you O
love O
yourself O
. O
'' O

If O
you O
obey O
this O
law O
, O
you O
are O
doing O
right O
. O

But O
if O
you O
are O
treating O
one O
person O
as O
more O
important O
than O
another O
, O
you O
are O
sinning O
. O

You O
are O
guilty O
of O
breaking O
God O
's O
law O
. O

You O
might O
follow O
all O
of O
God O
's O
law O
. O

But O
if O
you O
fail O
to O
obey O
only O
one O
command O
, O
you O
are O
guilty O
of O
breaking O
all O
the O
commands O
in O
that O
law O
. O

God O
said O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
commit O
adultery O
. O
'' O

The O
same O
God O
also O
said O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
kill O
. O
'' O

So O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
commit O
adultery O
, O
but O
you O
kill O
someone O
, O
you O
are O
guilty O
of O
breaking O
all O
of O
God O
's O
law O
. O

You O
will O
be O
judged O
by O
the O
law O
that O
makes O
people O
free O
. O

You O
should O
remember O
this O
in O
everything O
you O
say O
and O
do O
. O

Yes O
, O
you O
must O
show O
mercy O
to O
others O
. O

If O
you O
do O
not O
show O
mercy O
, O
then O
God O
will O
not O
show O
mercy O
to O
you O
when O
he O
judges O
you O
. O

But O
the O
one O
who O
shows O
mercy O
can O
stand O
without O
fear O
before O
the O
Judge O
. O

My O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
if O
a O
person O
claims O
to O
have O
faith O
but O
does O
nothing O
, O
that O
faith O
is O
worth O
nothing O
. O

Faith O
like O
that O
can O
not O
save O
anyone O
. O

Suppose O
a O
brother O
or O
sister O
in O
Christ O
comes O
to O
you O
in O
need O
of O
clothes O
or O
something O
to O
eat O
. O

And O
you O
say O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
God O
be O
with O
you O
! O

I O
hope O
you O
stay O
warm O
and O
get O
plenty O
to O
eat O
, O
'' O
but O
you O
do O
n't O
give O
them O
the O
things O
they O
need O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
help O
them O
, O
your O
words O
are O
worthless O
. O

It O
is O
the O
same O
with O
faith O
. O

If O
it O
is O
just O
faith O
and O
nothing O
more O
-- O
if O
it O
does O
n't O
do O
anything O
-- O
it O
is O
dead O
. O

But O
someone O
might O
argue O
, O
`` O
Some O
people O
have O
faith O
, O
and O
others O
have O
good O
works O
. O
'' O

My O
answer O
would O
be O
that O
you O
ca O
n't O
show O
me O
your O
faith O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
do O
anything O
. O

But O
I O
will O
show O
you O
my O
faith O
by O
the O
good O
I O
do O
. O

You O
believe O
there O
is O
one O
God O
. O

That O
's O
good O
, O
but O
even O
the O
demons O
believe O
that O
! O

And O
they O
shake O
with O
fear O
. O

You O
fool O
! O

Faith O
that O
does O
nothing O
is O
worth O
nothing O
. O

Do O
you O
want O
me O
to O
prove O
this O
to O
you O
? O

Our O
father O
Abraham O
was O
made O
right O
with O
God O
by O
what O
he O
did O
. O

He O
offered O
his O
son O
Isaac O
to O
God O
on O
the O
altar O
. O

So O
you O
see O
that O
Abraham O
's O
faith O
and O
what O
he O
did O
worked O
together O
. O

His O
faith O
was O
made O
perfect O
by O
what O
he O
did O
. O

This O
shows O
the O
full O
meaning O
of O
the O
Scriptures O
that O
say O
, O
`` O
Abraham O
believed O
God O
, O
and O
because O
of O
this O
faith O
he O
was O
accepted O
as O
one O
who O
is O
right O
with O
God O
. O
'' O

Abraham O
was O
called O
`` O
God O
's O
friend O
. O
'' O

So O
you O
see O
that O
people O
are O
made O
right O
with O
God O
by O
what O
they O
do O
. O

They O
can O
not O
be O
made O
right O
by O
faith O
alone O
. O

Another O
example O
is O
Rahab O
. O

She O
was O
a O
prostitute O
, O
but O
she O
was O
made O
right O
with O
God O
by O
something O
she O
did O
. O

She O
helped O
those O
who O
were O
spying O
for O
God O
's O
people O
. O

She O
welcomed O
them O
into O
her O
home O
and O
helped O
them O
escape O
by O
a O
different O
road O
. O

A O
person O
's O
body O
that O
does O
not O
have O
a O
spirit O
is O
dead O
. O

It O
is O
the O
same O
with O
faith O
-- O
faith O
that O
does O
nothing O
is O
dead O
! O

My O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
not O
many O
of O
you O
should O
be O
teachers O
. O

I O
say O
this O
because O
, O
as O
you O
know O
, O
we O
who O
teach O
will O
be O
judged O
more O
strictly O
than O
others O
. O

We O
all O
make O
many O
mistakes O
. O

A O
person O
who O
never O
said O
anything O
wrong O
would O
be O
perfect O
. O

Someone O
like O
that O
would O
be O
able O
to O
control O
their O
whole O
body O
too O
. O

We O
put O
bits O
into O
the O
mouths O
of O
horses O
to O
make O
them O
obey O
us O
. O

With O
these O
bits O
we O
can O
control O
their O
whole O
body O
. O

It O
is O
the O
same O
with O
ships O
. O

A O
ship O
is O
very O
big O
, O
and O
it O
is O
pushed O
by O
strong O
winds O
. O

But O
a O
very O
small O
rudder O
controls O
that O
big O
ship O
. O

And O
the O
one O
who O
controls O
the O
rudder O
decides O
where O
the O
ship O
will O
go O
. O

It O
goes O
where O
he O
wants O
it O
to O
go O
. O

It O
is O
the O
same O
with O
our O
tongue O
. O

It O
is O
a O
small O
part O
of O
the O
body O
, O
but O
it O
can O
boast O
about O
doing O
great O
things O
. O

A O
big O
forest O
fire O
can O
be O
started O
with O
only O
a O
little O
flame O
. O

The O
tongue O
is O
like O
a O
fire O
. O

It O
is O
a O
world O
of O
evil O
among O
the O
parts O
of O
our O
body O
. O

It O
spreads O
its O
evil O
through O
our O
whole O
body O
and O
starts O
a O
fire O
that O
influences O
all O
of O
life O
. O

It O
gets O
this O
fire O
from O
hell O
. O

Humans O
have O
control O
over O
every O
kind O
of O
wild O
animal O
, O
bird O
, O
reptile O
, O
and O
fish O
, O
and O
they O
have O
controlled O
all O
these O
things O
. O

But O
no O
one O
can O
control O
the O
tongue O
. O

It O
is O
wild O
and O
evil O
, O
full O
of O
deadly O
poison O
. O

We O
use O
our O
tongues O
to O
praise O
our O
Lord O
and O
Father O
, O
but O
then O
we O
curse O
people O
who O
were O
created O
in O
God O
's O
likeness O
. O

These O
praises O
and O
curses O
come O
from O
the O
same O
mouth O
. O

My O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
this O
should O
not O
happen O
. O

Do O
good O
water O
and O
bad O
water O
flow O
from O
the O
same O
spring O
? O

Of O
course O
not O
. O

My O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
can O
a O
fig O
tree O
make O
olives O
? O

Or O
can O
a O
grapevine O
make O
figs O
? O

No O
, O
and O
a O
well O
full O
of O
salty O
water O
can O
not O
give O
good O
water O
. O

Are O
there O
any O
among O
you O
who O
are O
really O
wise O
and O
understanding O
? O

Then O
you O
should O
show O
your O
wisdom O
by O
living O
right O
. O

You O
should O
do O
what O
is O
good O
with O
humility O
. O

A O
wise O
person O
does O
not O
boast O
. O

If O
you O
are O
selfish O
and O
have O
bitter O
jealousy O
in O
your O
hearts O
, O
you O
have O
no O
reason O
to O
boast O
. O

Your O
boasting O
is O
a O
lie O
that O
hides O
the O
truth O
. O

That O
kind O
of O
`` O
wisdom O
'' O
does O
not O
come O
from O
God O
. O

That O
`` O
wisdom O
'' O
comes O
from O
the O
world O
. O

It O
is O
not O
spiritual O
. O

It O
is O
from O
the O
devil O
. O

Where O
there O
is O
jealousy O
and O
selfishness O
, O
there O
will O
be O
confusion O
and O
every O
kind O
of O
evil O
. O

But O
the O
wisdom O
that O
comes O
from O
God O
is O
like O
this O
: O

First O
, O
it O
is O
pure O
. O

It O
is O
also O
peaceful O
, O
gentle O
, O
and O
easy O
to O
please O
. O

This O
wisdom O
is O
always O
ready O
to O
help O
people O
who O
have O
trouble O
and O
to O
do O
good O
for O
others O
. O

This O
wisdom O
is O
always O
fair O
and O
honest O
. O

People O
who O
work O
for O
peace O
in O
a O
peaceful O
way O
get O
the O
blessings O
that O
come O
from O
right O
living O
. O

Greetings O
from O
James O
, O
a O
servant O
of O
God O
and O
of O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

To O
God O
's O
people O
who O
are O
scattered O
all O
over O
the O
world O
. O

My O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
you O
will O
have O
many O
kinds O
of O
trouble O
. O

But O
this O
gives O
you O
a O
reason O
to O
be O
very O
happy O
. O

You O
know O
that O
when O
your O
faith O
is O
tested O
, O
you O
learn O
to O
be O
patient O
in O
suffering O
. O

If O
you O
let O
that O
patience O
work O
in O
you O
, O
the O
end O
result O
will O
be O
good O
. O

You O
will O
be O
mature O
and O
complete O
. O

You O
will O
be O
all O
that O
God O
wants O
you O
to O
be O
. O

Do O
any O
of O
you O
need O
wisdom O
? O

Ask O
God O
for O
it O
. O

He O
is O
generous O
and O
enjoys O
giving O
to O
everyone O
. O

So O
he O
will O
give O
you O
wisdom O
. O

But O
when O
you O
ask O
God O
, O
you O
must O
believe O
. O

Do O
n't O
doubt O
him O
. O

Whoever O
doubts O
is O
like O
a O
wave O
in O
the O
sea O
that O
is O
blown O
up O
and O
down O
by O
the O
wind O
. O

People O
like O
that O
are O
thinking O
two O
different O
things O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

They O
can O
never O
decide O
what O
to O
do O
. O

So O
they O
should O
not O
think O
they O
will O
receive O
anything O
from O
the O
Lord O
. O

Believers O
who O
are O
poor O
should O
be O
glad O
that O
God O
considers O
them O
so O
important O
. O

Believers O
who O
are O
rich O
should O
be O
glad O
when O
bad O
things O
happen O
that O
humble O
them O
. O

Their O
riches O
wo O
n't O
keep O
them O
from O
disappearing O
as O
quickly O
as O
wildflowers O
. O

As O
the O
sun O
rises O
and O
gets O
hotter O
, O
its O
heat O
dries O
up O
the O
plants O
, O
and O
the O
flowers O
fall O
off O
. O

The O
flowers O
that O
were O
so O
beautiful O
are O
now O
dead O
. O

That O
's O
how O
it O
is O
with O
the O
rich O
. O

While O
they O
are O
still O
making O
plans O
for O
their O
business O
, O
they O
will O
die O
. O

Great O
blessings O
belong O
to O
those O
who O
are O
tempted O
and O
remain O
faithful O
! O

After O
they O
have O
proved O
their O
faith O
, O
God O
will O
give O
them O
the O
crown O
of O
eternal O
life O
. O

God O
promised O
this O
to O
all O
people O
who O
love O
him O
. O

Whenever O
you O
feel O
tempted O
to O
do O
something O
bad O
, O
you O
should O
not O
say O
, O
`` O
God O
is O
tempting O
me O
. O
'' O

Evil O
can O
not O
tempt O
God O
, O
and O
God O
himself O
does O
not O
tempt O
anyone O
. O

You O
are O
tempted O
by O
the O
evil O
things O
you O
want O
. O

Your O
own O
desire O
leads O
you O
away O
and O
traps O
you O
. O

Your O
desire O
grows O
inside O
you O
until O
it O
results O
in O
sin O
. O

Then O
the O
sin O
grows O
bigger O
and O
bigger O
and O
finally O
ends O
in O
death O
. O

My O
dear O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
do O
n't O
be O
fooled O
about O
this O
. O

Everything O
good O
comes O
from O
God O
. O

Every O
perfect O
gift O
is O
from O
him O
. O

These O
good O
gifts O
come O
down O
from O
the O
Father O
who O
made O
all O
the O
lights O
in O
the O
sky O
. O

But O
God O
never O
changes O
like O
the O
shadows O
from O
those O
lights O
. O

He O
is O
always O
the O
same O
. O

God O
decided O
to O
give O
us O
life O
through O
the O
true O
message O
he O
sent O
to O
us O
. O

He O
wanted O
us O
to O
be O
the O
most O
important O
of O
all O
that O
he O
created O
. O

My O
dear O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
always O
be O
more O
willing O
to O
listen O
than O
to O
speak O
. O

Keep O
control O
of O
your O
anger O
. O

Anger O
does O
not O
help O
you O
live O
the O
way O
God O
wants O
. O

So O
get O
rid O
of O
everything O
evil O
in O
your O
lives O
-- O
every O
kind O
of O
wrong O
you O
do O
. O

Be O
humble O
and O
accept O
God O
's O
teaching O
that O
is O
planted O
in O
your O
hearts O
. O

This O
teaching O
can O
save O
you O
. O

Do O
what O
God O
's O
teaching O
says O
; O
do O
n't O
just O
listen O
and O
do O
nothing O
. O

When O
you O
only O
sit O
and O
listen O
, O
you O
are O
fooling O
yourselves O
. O

Hearing O
God O
's O
teaching O
and O
doing O
nothing O
is O
like O
looking O
at O
your O
face O
in O
the O
mirror O
and O
doing O
nothing O
about O
what O
you O
saw O
. O

You O
go O
away O
and O
immediately O
forget O
how O
bad O
you O
looked O
. O

But O
when O
you O
look O
into O
God O
's O
perfect O
law O
that O
sets O
people O
free O
, O
pay O
attention O
to O
it O
. O

If O
you O
do O
what O
it O
says O
, O
you O
will O
have O
God O
's O
blessing O
. O

Never O
just O
listen O
to O
his O
teaching O
and O
forget O
what O
you O
heard O
. O

You O
might O
think O
you O
are O
a O
very O
religious O
person O
. O

But O
if O
your O
tongue O
is O
out O
of O
control O
, O
you O
are O
fooling O
yourself O
. O

Your O
careless O
talk O
makes O
your O
offerings O
to O
God O
worthless O
. O

The O
worship O
that O
God O
wants O
is O
this O
: O
caring O
for O
orphans O
or O
widows O
who O
need O
help O
and O
keeping O
yourself O
free O
from O
the O
world O
's O
evil O
influence O
. O

This O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
worship O
that O
God O
accepts O
as O
pure O
and O
good O
. O

And O
now O
, O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
pray O
for O
us O
. O

Pray O
that O
the O
Lord O
's O
teaching O
will O
continue O
to O
spread O
quickly O
. O

And O
pray O
that O
people O
will O
give O
honor O
to O
that O
teaching O
, O
the O
same O
as O
happened O
with O
you O
. O

And O
pray O
that O
we O
will O
be O
protected O
from O
crooked O
and O
evil O
people O
. O

Not O
everyone O
believes O
in O
the O
Lord O
, O
you O
know O
. O

But O
the O
Lord O
is O
faithful O
. O

He O
will O
give O
you O
strength O
and O
protect O
you O
from O
the O
Evil O
One O
. O

The O
Lord O
gives O
us O
confidence O
that O
you O
are O
doing O
what O
we O
told O
you O
and O
that O
you O
will O
continue O
to O
do O
it O
. O

We O
pray O
that O
the O
Lord O
will O
cause O
you O
to O
feel O
God O
's O
love O
and O
remember O
Christ O
's O
patient O
endurance O
. O

Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
by O
the O
authority O
of O
our O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
we O
tell O
you O
to O
stay O
away O
from O
any O
believer O
who O
refuses O
to O
work O
. O

People O
who O
refuse O
to O
work O
are O
not O
following O
the O
teaching O
that O
we O
gave O
them O
. O

You O
yourselves O
know O
that O
you O
should O
live O
like O
we O
do O
. O

We O
were O
not O
lazy O
when O
we O
were O
with O
you O
. O

We O
never O
accepted O
food O
from O
anyone O
without O
paying O
for O
it O
. O

We O
worked O
and O
worked O
so O
that O
we O
would O
not O
be O
a O
burden O
to O
any O
of O
you O
. O

We O
worked O
night O
and O
day O
. O

We O
had O
the O
right O
to O
ask O
you O
to O
help O
us O
. O

But O
we O
worked O
to O
take O
care O
of O
ourselves O
so O
that O
we O
would O
be O
an O
example O
for O
you O
to O
follow O
. O

When O
we O
were O
with O
you O
, O
we O
gave O
you O
this O
rule O
: O
`` O
Whoever O
will O
not O
work O
should O
not O
be O
allowed O
to O
eat O
. O
'' O

We O
hear O
that O
some O
people O
in O
your O
group O
refuse O
to O
work O
. O

They O
are O
doing O
nothing O
except O
being O
busy O
in O
the O
lives O
of O
others O
. O

Our O
instruction O
to O
them O
is O
to O
stop O
bothering O
others O
, O
to O
start O
working O
and O
earn O
their O
own O
food O
. O

It O
is O
by O
the O
authority O
of O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
that O
we O
are O
urging O
them O
to O
do O
this O
. O

Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
never O
get O
tired O
of O
doing O
good O
. O

If O
there O
are O
some O
there O
who O
refuse O
to O
do O
what O
we O
tell O
you O
in O
this O
letter O
, O
remember O
who O
they O
are O
. O

Do O
n't O
associate O
with O
them O
. O

Then O
maybe O
they O
will O
feel O
ashamed O
. O

But O
do O
n't O
treat O
them O
as O
enemies O
. O

Counsel O
them O
as O
fellow O
believers O
. O

We O
pray O
that O
the O
Lord O
of O
peace O
will O
give O
you O
peace O
at O
all O
times O
and O
in O
every O
way O
. O

The O
Lord O
be O
with O
you O
all O
. O

Here O
's O
my O
greeting O
in O
my O
own O
handwriting O
-- O
Paul O
. O

I O
do O
this O
in O
all O
my O
letters O
to O
show O
they O
are O
from O
me O
. O

This O
is O
the O
way O
I O
write O
. O

The O
grace O
of O
our O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
be O
with O
you O
all O
. O

Greetings O
from O
Paul O
, O
Silas O
, O
and O
Timothy O
. O

To O
the O
church O
of O
those O
in O
Thessalonica O
, O
who O
are O
in O
God O
our O
Father O
and O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

Grace O
and O
peace O
to O
you O
from O
God O
the O
Father O
and O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

We O
thank O
God O
for O
you O
always O
. O

And O
that O
's O
what O
we O
should O
do O
, O
because O
you O
give O
us O
good O
reason O
to O
be O
thankful O
: O
Your O
faith O
is O
growing O
more O
and O
more O
. O

And O
the O
love O
that O
every O
one O
of O
you O
has O
for O
each O
other O
is O
also O
growing O
. O

So O
we O
tell O
the O
other O
churches O
of O
God O
how O
proud O
we O
are O
of O
you O
. O

We O
tell O
them O
how O
you O
patiently O
continue O
to O
be O
strong O
and O
have O
faith O
, O
even O
though O
you O
are O
being O
persecuted O
and O
are O
suffering O
many O
troubles O
. O

This O
is O
proof O
that O
God O
is O
right O
in O
his O
judgment O
. O

He O
wants O
you O
to O
be O
worthy O
of O
his O
kingdom O
. O

Your O
suffering O
is O
for O
that O
kingdom O
. O

God O
will O
do O
what O
is O
right O
. O

He O
will O
punish O
those O
who O
are O
causing O
you O
trouble O
. O

And O
he O
will O
bring O
relief O
to O
you O
who O
are O
troubled O
. O

He O
will O
bring O
it O
to O
you O
and O
to O
us O
when O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
comes O
from O
heaven O
for O
all O
to O
see O
, O
together O
with O
his O
powerful O
angels O
. O

He O
will O
come O
with O
burning O
fire O
to O
punish O
those O
who O
do O
n't O
know O
God O
-- O
those O
who O
refuse O
to O
accept O
the O
Good O
News O
about O
our O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

They O
will O
be O
punished O
with O
a O
destruction O
that O
never O
ends O
. O

They O
will O
not O
be O
allowed O
to O
be O
with O
the O
Lord O
but O
will O
be O
kept O
away O
from O
his O
great O
power O
. O

This O
will O
happen O
on O
the O
day O
when O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
comes O
to O
receive O
honor O
with O
his O
holy O
people O
. O

He O
will O
be O
admired O
among O
all O
who O
have O
believed O
. O

And O
this O
includes O
you O
because O
you O
believed O
what O
we O
told O
you O
. O

That O
is O
why O
we O
always O
pray O
for O
you O
. O

We O
ask O
our O
God O
to O
help O
you O
live O
the O
good O
way O
he O
wanted O
when O
he O
chose O
you O
. O

The O
goodness O
you O
have O
makes O
you O
want O
to O
do O
good O
. O

And O
the O
faith O
you O
have O
makes O
you O
work O
. O

We O
pray O
that O
with O
his O
power O
God O
will O
help O
you O
do O
these O
things O
more O
and O
more O
. O

Then O
the O
name O
of O
our O
Lord O
Jesus O
will O
be O
honored O
because O
of O
you O
, O
and O
you O
will O
be O
honored O
because O
of O
him O
. O

This O
can O
happen O
only O
by O
the O
grace O
of O
our O
God O
and O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
we O
have O
something O
to O
say O
about O
the O
coming O
of O
our O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

We O
want O
to O
talk O
to O
you O
about O
that O
time O
when O
we O
will O
meet O
together O
with O
him O
. O

Do O
n't O
let O
yourselves O
be O
easily O
upset O
or O
worried O
if O
you O
hear O
that O
the O
day O
of O
the O
Lord O
has O
already O
come O
. O

Someone O
might O
say O
that O
this O
idea O
came O
from O
us O
-- O
in O
something O
the O
Spirit O
told O
us O
, O
or O
in O
something O
we O
said O
, O
or O
in O
a O
letter O
we O
wrote O
. O

Do O
n't O
be O
fooled O
by O
anything O
they O
might O
say O
. O

That O
day O
of O
the O
Lord O
will O
not O
come O
until O
the O
turning O
away O
from O
God O
happens O
. O

And O
that O
day O
will O
not O
come O
until O
the O
Man O
of O
Evil O
appears O
, O
the O
one O
who O
belongs O
to O
hell O
. O

He O
will O
stand O
against O
and O
put O
himself O
above O
everything O
that O
people O
worship O
or O
think O
is O
worthy O
of O
worship O
. O

He O
will O
even O
go O
into O
God O
's O
Temple O
and O
sit O
there O
, O
claiming O
that O
he O
is O
God O
. O

I O
told O
you O
before O
that O
all O
these O
things O
would O
happen O
. O

Remember O
? O

And O
you O
know O
what O
is O
stopping O
that O
Man O
of O
Evil O
now O
. O

He O
is O
being O
stopped O
now O
so O
that O
he O
will O
appear O
at O
the O
right O
time O
. O

The O
secret O
power O
of O
evil O
is O
already O
working O
in O
the O
world O
now O
. O

But O
there O
is O
one O
who O
is O
stopping O
that O
secret O
power O
of O
evil O
. O

And O
he O
will O
continue O
to O
stop O
it O
until O
he O
is O
taken O
out O
of O
the O
way O
. O

Then O
that O
Man O
of O
Evil O
will O
appear O
. O

But O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
will O
kill O
him O
with O
the O
breath O
that O
comes O
from O
his O
mouth O
. O

The O
Lord O
will O
come O
in O
a O
way O
that O
everyone O
will O
see O
, O
and O
that O
will O
be O
the O
end O
of O
the O
Man O
of O
Evil O
. O

When O
that O
Man O
of O
Evil O
comes O
, O
it O
will O
be O
the O
work O
of O
Satan O
. O

He O
will O
come O
with O
great O
power O
, O
and O
he O
will O
do O
all O
kinds O
of O
false O
miracles O
, O
signs O
, O
and O
wonders O
. O

The O
Man O
of O
Evil O
will O
use O
every O
kind O
of O
evil O
to O
fool O
those O
who O
are O
lost O
. O

They O
are O
lost O
because O
they O
refused O
to O
love O
the O
truth O
and O
be O
saved O
. O

So O
God O
will O
send O
them O
something O
powerful O
that O
leads O
them O
away O
from O
the O
truth O
and O
causes O
them O
to O
believe O
a O
lie O
. O

They O
will O
all O
be O
condemned O
because O
they O
did O
not O
believe O
the O
truth O
and O
because O
they O
enjoyed O
doing O
evil O
. O

Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
you O
are O
people O
the O
Lord O
loves O
. O

And O
we O
always O
thank O
God O
for O
you O
. O

That O
's O
what O
we O
should O
do O
, O
because O
God O
chose O
you O
to O
be O
some O
of O
the O
first O
people O
to O
be O
saved O
. O

You O
are O
saved O
by O
the O
Spirit O
making O
you O
holy O
and O
by O
your O
faith O
in O
the O
truth O
. O

God O
chose O
you O
to O
have O
that O
salvation O
. O

He O
chose O
you O
by O
using O
the O
Good O
News O
that O
we O
told O
you O
. O

You O
were O
chosen O
so O
that O
you O
can O

and O

that O
has O
no O

and O

Grace O
and O
peace O
to O
you O
from O
God O
our O
Father O
and O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

I O
remember O
you O
in O
my O
prayers O
. O

And O
I O
always O
thank O
my O
God O
for O
you O
. O

I O
thank O
God O
because O
I O
hear O
about O
the O
love O
you O
have O
for O
all O
of O
God O
's O
holy O
people O
and O
the O
faith O
you O
have O
in O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
. O

I O
pray O
that O
the O
faith O
you O
share O
will O
make O
you O
understand O
every O
blessing O
we O
have O
in O
Christ O
. O

My O
brother O
, O
you O
have O
shown O
love O
to O
God O
's O
people O
, O
and O
your O
help O
has O
greatly O
encouraged O
them O
. O

What O
a O
great O
joy O
and O
encouragement O
that O
has O
been O
to O
me O
. O

There O
is O
something O
that O
you O
should O
do O
. O

And O
because O
of O
the O
authority O
I O
have O
in O
Christ O
, O
I O
feel O
free O
to O
command O
you O
to O
do O
it O
. O

But O
I O
am O
not O
commanding O
you O
; O
I O
am O
asking O
you O
to O
do O
it O
out O
of O
love O
. O

I O
, O
Paul O
, O
am O
an O
old O
man O
now O
, O
and O
I O
am O
a O
prisoner O
for O
Christ O
Jesus O
. O

I O
am O
asking O
you O
for O
my O
son O
Onesimus O
. O

He O
became O
my O
son O
while O
I O
was O
in O
prison O
. O

In O
the O
past O
he O
was O
useless O
to O
you O
. O

But O
now O
he O
has O
become O
useful O
for O
both O
you O
and O
me O
. O

I O
am O
sending O
him O
back O
to O
you O
, O
but O
it O
's O
as O
hard O
as O
losing O
part O
of O
myself O
. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
keep O
him O
here O
to O
help O
me O
while O
I O
am O
still O
in O
prison O
for O
telling O
the O
Good O
News O
. O

By O
helping O
me O
here O
, O
he O
would O
be O
representing O
you O
. O

But O
I O
did O
not O
want O
to O
do O
anything O
without O
asking O
you O
first O
. O

Then O
whatever O
you O
do O
for O
me O
will O
be O
what O
you O
want O
to O
do O
, O
not O
what O
I O
forced O
you O
to O
do O
. O

Onesimus O
was O
separated O
from O
you O
for O
a O
short O
time O
. O

Maybe O
that O
happened O
so O
that O
you O
could O
have O
him O
back O
forever O
, O
not O
to O
be O
just O
a O
slave O
, O
but O
better O
than O
a O
slave O
, O
to O
be O
a O
dear O
brother O
. O

That O
's O
what O
he O
is O
to O
me O
. O

And O
I O
know O
he O
will O
mean O
even O
more O
to O
you O
, O
both O
as O
your O
slave O
and O
as O
one O
who O
shares O
your O
faith O
in O
the O
Lord O
. O

If O
you O
accept O
me O
as O
your O
friend O
, O
then O
accept O
Onesimus O
back O
. O

Welcome O
him O
like O
you O
would O
welcome O
me O
. O

If O
he O
has O
done O
any O
wrong O
to O
you O
or O
owes O
you O
anything O
, O
charge O
that O
to O
me O
. O

I O
, O
Paul O
, O
am O
writing O
this O
in O
my O
own O
handwriting O
: O

I O
will O
pay O
back O
anything O
Onesimus O
owes O
. O

And O
I O
will O
say O
nothing O
about O
what O
you O
owe O
me O
for O
your O
own O
life O
. O

So O
, O
my O
brother O
, O
as O
a O
follower O
of O
the O
Lord O
please O
do O
this O
favor O
for O
me O
. O

It O
would O
be O
such O
a O
great O
encouragement O
to O
me O
as O
your O
brother O
in O
Christ O
. O

I O
write O
this O
letter O
knowing O
that O
you O
will O
do O
what O
I O
ask O
, O
and O
even O
more O
than O
I O
ask O
. O

Also O
, O
please O
prepare O
a O
room O
for O
me O
. O

I O
hope O
that O
God O
will O
answer O
your O
prayers O
and O
that O
I O
will O
be O
able O
to O
come O
and O
see O
you O
. O

Epaphras O
is O
a O
prisoner O
with O
me O
for O
Christ O
Jesus O
. O

He O
sends O
you O
his O
greetings O
. O

Also O
Mark O
, O
Aristarchus O
, O
Demas O
, O
and O
Luke O
send O
their O
greetings O
. O

They O
are O
workers O
together O
with O
me O
. O

The O
grace O
of O
our O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
be O
with O
your O
spirit O
. O

Dear O
friends O
, O
we O
have O
these O
promises O
from O
God O
. O

So O
we O
should O
make O
ourselves O
pure O
-- O
free O
from O
anything O
that O
makes O
our O
body O
or O
our O
soul O
unclean O
. O

Our O
respect O
for O
God O
should O
make O
us O
try O
to O
be O
completely O
holy O
in O
the O
way O
we O
live O
. O

Open O
your O
hearts O
to O
us O
. O

We O
have O
not O
done O
wrong O
to O
anyone O
or O
caused O
harm O
to O
anyone O
. O

And O
we O
have O
not O
cheated O
anyone O
. O

I O
do O
not O
say O
this O
to O
blame O
you O
. O

I O
told O
you O
before O
that O
we O
love O
you O
so O
much O
we O
would O
live O
or O
die O
with O
you O
. O

I O
feel O
that O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
anything O
. O

I O
am O
very O
proud O
of O
you O
. O

Even O
with O
all O
the O
troubles O
we O
have O
had O
, O
I O
am O
greatly O
encouraged O
and O
feel O
very O
happy O
. O

When O
we O
came O
into O
Macedonia O
, O
we O
had O
no O
rest O
. O

We O
found O
trouble O
all O
around O
us O
. O

We O
had O
fighting O
on O
the O
outside O
and O
fear O
on O
the O
inside O
. O

But O
God O
encourages O
those O
who O
are O
troubled O
, O
and O
he O
certainly O
encouraged O
us O
by O
bringing O
Titus O
to O
us O
. O

It O
was O
so O
good O
to O
see O
him O
, O
but O
we O
were O
encouraged O
even O
more O
to O
hear O
about O
the O
encouragement O
you O
gave O
him O
. O

He O
told O
us O
that O
you O
really O
want O
to O
see O
me O
and O
that O
you O
are O
very O
sorry O
for O
what O
you O
did O
. O

And O
he O
told O
us O
how O
ready O
and O
willing O
you O
are O
to O
help O
me O
. O

When O
I O
heard O
this O
, O
I O
was O
so O
much O
happier O
. O

Even O
if O
the O
letter O
I O
wrote O
you O
made O
you O
sad O
, O
I O
am O
not O
sorry O
I O
wrote O
it O
. O

I O
know O
that O
letter O
made O
you O
sad O
, O
and O
I O
was O
sorry O
for O
that O
. O

But O
it O
made O
you O
sad O
only O
for O
a O
short O
time O
. O

Now O
I O
am O
happy O
, O
not O
because O
you O
were O
made O
sad O
, O
but O
because O
your O
sorrow O
made O
you O
decide O
to O
change O
. O

That O
is O
what O
God O
wanted O
, O
so O
you O
were O
not O
hurt O
by O
us O
in O
any O
way O
. O

The O
kind O
of O
sorrow O
God O
wants O
makes O
people O
decide O
to O
change O
their O
lives O
. O

This O
leads O
them O
to O
salvation O
, O
and O
we O
can O
not O
be O
sorry O
for O
that O
. O

But O
the O
kind O
of O
sorrow O
the O
world O
has O
will O
bring O
death O
. O

You O
had O
the O
kind O
of O
sorrow O
God O
wanted O
you O
to O
have O
. O

Now O
see O
what O
that O
sorrow O
has O
brought O
you O
: O
It O
has O
made O
you O
very O
serious O
. O

It O
made O
you O
want O
to O
prove O
that O
you O
were O
not O
wrong O
. O

It O
made O
you O
angry O
and O
afraid O
. O

It O
made O
you O
want O
to O
see O
me O
. O

It O
made O
you O
care O
. O

It O
made O
you O
want O
the O
right O
thing O
to O
be O
done O
. O

You O
proved O
that O
you O
were O
not O
guilty O
in O
any O
part O
of O
that O
problem O
. O

The O
main O
reason O
I O
wrote O
that O
letter O
was O
not O
because O
of O
the O
one O
who O
did O
the O
wrong O
or O
the O
one O
who O
was O
hurt O
. O

I O
wrote O
so O
that O
you O
would O
realize O
, O
before O
God O
, O
how O
very O
much O
you O
care O
for O
us O
. O

And O
that O
is O
what O
was O
so O
encouraging O
to O
us O
. O

We O
were O
greatly O
encouraged O
, O
but O
we O
were O
especially O
pleased O
to O
see O
how O
happy O
Titus O
was O
. O

You O
all O
made O
him O
feel O
so O
much O
better O
. O

I O
had O
bragged O
about O
you O
to O
Titus O
, O
and O
you O
did O
n't O
embarrass O
me O
. O

We O
have O
always O
told O
you O
the O
truth O
, O
and O
now O
what O
we O
told O
Titus O
about O
you O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
be O
true O
. O

And O
his O
love O
for O
you O
is O
stronger O
when O
he O
remembers O
that O
you O
were O
all O
ready O
to O
obey O
. O

You O
welcomed O
him O
with O
respect O
and O
fear O
. O

I O
am O
so O
happy O
that O
I O
can O
trust O
you O
fully O
. O

We O
know O
that O
our O
body O
-- O
the O
tent O
we O
live O
in O
here O
on O
earth O
-- O
will O
be O
destroyed O
. O

But O
when O
that O
happens O
, O
God O
will O
have O
a O
home O
for O
us O
to O
live O
in O
. O

It O
will O
not O
be O
the O
kind O
of O
home O
people O
build O
here O
. O

It O
will O
be O
a O
home O
in O
heaven O
that O
will O
continue O
forever O
. O

But O
now O
we O
are O
tired O
of O
this O
body O
. O

We O
want O
God O
to O
give O
us O
our O
heavenly O
home O
. O

It O
will O
clothe O
us O
and O
we O
will O
not O
be O
naked O
. O

While O
we O
live O
in O
this O
tent O
, O
we O
have O
burdens O
and O
so O
we O
complain O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
mean O
that O
we O
want O
to O
remove O
this O
tent O
, O
but O
we O
want O
to O
be O
clothed O
with O
our O
heavenly O
home O
. O

Then O
this O
body O
that O
dies O
will O
be O
covered O
with O
life O
. O

This O
is O
what O
God O
himself O
made O
us O
for O
. O

And O
he O
has O
given O
us O
the O
Spirit O
as O
the O
first O
payment O
to O
guarantee O
the O
life O
to O
come O
. O

So O
we O
always O
have O
confidence O
. O

We O
know O
that O
while O
we O
live O
in O
this O
body O
, O
we O
are O
away O
from O
the O
Lord O
. O

We O
live O
by O
what O
we O
believe O
will O
happen O
, O
not O
by O
what O
we O
can O
see O
. O

So O
I O
say O
that O
we O
have O
confidence O
. O

And O
we O
really O
want O
to O
be O
away O
from O
this O
body O
and O
be O
at O
home O
with O
the O
Lord O
. O

Our O
only O
goal O
is O
to O
always O
please O
the O
Lord O
, O
whether O
we O
are O
living O
here O
in O
this O
body O
or O
there O
with O
him O
. O

We O
must O
all O
stand O
before O
Christ O
to O
be O
judged O
. O

Everyone O
will O
get O
what O
they O
should O
. O

They O
will O
be O
paid O
for O
whatever O
they O
did O
-- O
good O
or O
bad O
-- O
when O
they O
lived O
in O
this O
earthly O
body O
. O

We O
know O
what O
it O
means O
to O
fear O
the O
Lord O
, O
so O
we O
try O
to O
help O
people O
accept O
the O
truth O
. O

God O
knows O
what O
we O
really O
are O
, O
and O
I O
hope O
that O
in O
your O
hearts O
you O
know O
us O
too O
. O

We O
are O
not O
trying O
to O
prove O
ourselves O
to O
you O
again O
. O

But O
we O
are O
telling O
you O
about O
ourselves O
. O

We O
are O
giving O
you O
reasons O
to O
be O
proud O
of O
us O
. O

Then O
you O
will O
have O
an O
answer O
for O
those O
who O
are O
proud O
about O
what O
can O
be O
seen O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
care O
about O
what O
is O
in O
a O
person O
's O
heart O
. O

If O
we O
are O
crazy O
, O
it O
is O
for O
God O
. O

If O
we O
have O
our O
right O
mind O
, O
it O
is O
for O
you O
. O

The O
love O
of O
Christ O
controls O
us O
, O
because O
we O
know O
that O
one O
person O
died O
for O
everyone O
. O

So O
all O
have O
died O
. O

He O
died O
for O
all O
so O
that O
those O
who O
live O
would O
not O
continue O
to O
live O
for O
themselves O
. O

He O
died O
for O
them O
and O
was O
raised O
from O
death O
so O
that O
they O
would O
live O
for O
him O
. O

> O
From O
this O
time O
on O
we O
do O
n't O
think O
of O
anyone O
as O
the O
world O
thinks O
of O
people O
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
in O
the O
past O
we O
thought O
of O
Christ O
as O
the O
world O
thinks O
. O

But O
we O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
way O
now O
. O

When O
anyone O
is O
in O
Christ O
, O
it O
is O
a O
whole O
new O
world O
. O

The O
old O
things O
are O
gone O
; O
suddenly O
, O
everything O
is O
new O
! O

All O
this O
is O
from O
God O
. O

Through O
Christ O
, O
God O
made O
peace O
between O
himself O
and O
us O
. O

And O
God O
gave O
us O
the O
work O
of O
bringing O
people O
into O
peace O
with O
him O
. O

I O
mean O
that O
God O
was O
in O
Christ O
, O
making O
peace O
between O
the O
world O
and O
himself O
. O

In O
Christ O
, O
God O
did O
not O
hold O
people O
guilty O
for O
their O
sins O
. O

And O
he O
gave O
us O
this O
message O
of O
peace O
to O
tell O
people O
. O

So O
we O
have O
been O
sent O
to O
speak O
for O
Christ O
. O

It O
is O
like O
God O
is O
calling O
to O
people O
through O
us O
. O

We O
speak O
for O
Christ O
when O
we O
beg O
you O
to O
be O
at O
peace O
with O
God O
. O

Christ O
had O
no O
sin O
, O
but O
God O
made O
him O
become O
sin O
so O
that O
in O
Christ O
we O
could O
be O
right O
with O
God O
. O

There O
is O
more O
that O
I O
have O
to O
say O
about O
myself O
. O

It O
wo O
n't O
help O
, O
but O
I O
will O
talk O
now O
about O
visions O
and O
revelations O
from O
the O
Lord O
. O

I O
know O
a O
man O
in O
Christ O
who O
was O
taken O
up O
to O
the O
third O
heaven O
. O

This O
happened O
14 O
years O
ago O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
the O
man O
was O
in O
his O
body O
or O
out O
of O
his O
body O
, O
but O
God O
knows O
. O

And O
I O
know O
that O
this O
man O
was O
taken O
up O
to O
paradise O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
he O
was O
in O
his O
body O
or O
away O
from O
his O
body O
, O
but O
he O
heard O
things O
that O
he O
is O
not O
able O
to O
explain O
. O

He O
heard O
things O
that O
no O
one O
is O
allowed O
to O
tell O
. O

I O
will O
boast O
about O
a O
man O
like O
that O
, O
but O
I O
will O
not O
boast O
about O
myself O
. O

I O
will O
boast O
only O
about O
my O
weaknesses O
. O

But O
if O
I O
wanted O
to O
say O
more O
about O
myself O
, O
I O
would O
not O
be O
a O
fool O
, O
because O
I O
would O
be O
telling O
the O
truth O
. O

But O
I O
wo O
n't O
say O
any O
more O
, O
because O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
people O
to O
think O
more O
of O
me O
than O
what O
they O
see O
me O
do O
or O
hear O
me O
say O
. O

But O
I O
must O
not O
be O
too O
proud O
of O
the O
wonderful O
things O
that O
were O
shown O
to O
me O
. O

So O
a O
painful O
problem O
was O
given O
to O
me O
-- O
an O
angel O
from O
Satan O
, O
sent O
to O
make O
me O
suffer O
, O
so O
that O
I O
would O
not O
think O
that O
I O
am O
better O
than O
anyone O
else O
. O

I O
begged O
the O
Lord O
three O
times O
to O
take O
this O
problem O
away O
from O
me O
. O

But O
the O
Lord O
said O
, O
`` O
My O
grace O
is O
all O
you O
need O
. O

Only O
when O
you O
are O
weak O
can O
everything O
be O
done O
completely O
by O
my O
power O
. O
'' O

So O
I O
will O
gladly O
boast O
about O
my O
weaknesses O
. O

Then O
Christ O
's O
power O
can O
stay O
in O
me O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
am O
glad O
to O
have O
weaknesses O
if O
they O
are O
for O
Christ O
. O

I O
am O
glad O
to O
be O
insulted O
and O
have O
hard O
times O
. O

I O
am O
glad O
when O
I O
am O
persecuted O
and O
have O
problems O
, O
because O
it O
is O
when O
I O
am O
weak O
that O
I O
am O
really O
strong O
. O

I O
have O
been O
talking O
like O
a O
fool O
, O
but O
you O
made O
me O
do O
it O
. O

You O
people O
are O
the O
ones O
who O
should O
say O
good O
things O
about O
me O
. O

I O
am O
worth O
nothing O
, O
but O
those O
`` O
super O
apostles O
'' O
are O
not O
worth O
any O
more O
than O
I O
am O
! O

When O
I O
was O
with O
you O
, O
I O
patiently O
did O
the O
things O
that O
prove O
I O
am O
an O
apostle O
-- O
signs O
, O
wonders O
, O
and O
miracles O
. O

So O
you O
received O
everything O
that O
the O
other O
churches O
have O
received O
. O

Only O
one O
thing O
was O
different O
: O
I O
was O
not O
a O
burden O
to O
you O
. O

Forgive O
me O
for O
this O
! O

I O
am O
now O
ready O
to O
visit O
you O
for O
the O
third O
time O
, O
and O
I O
will O
not O
be O
a O
burden O
to O
you O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
want O
any O
of O
the O
things O
you O
own O
. O

I O
only O
want O
you O
. O

Children O
should O
not O
have O
to O
save O
things O
to O
give O
to O
their O
parents O
. O

Parents O
should O
save O
to O
give O
to O
their O
children O
. O

So O
I O
am O
happy O
to O
give O
everything O
I O
have O
for O
you O
. O

I O
will O
even O
give O
myself O
for O
you O
. O

If O
I O
love O
you O
more O
, O
will O
you O
love O
me O
less O
? O

It O
is O
clear O
that O
I O
was O
not O
a O
burden O
to O
you O
, O
but O
you O
think O
that O
I O
was O
tricky O
and O
used O
lies O
to O
catch O
you O
. O

Did O
I O
cheat O
you O
by O
using O
any O
of O
the O
men O
I O
sent O
to O
you O
? O

You O
know O
I O
did O
n't O
. O

I O
asked O
Titus O
to O
go O
to O
you O
, O
and O
I O
sent O
our O
brother O
with O
him O
. O

Titus O
did O
not O
cheat O
you O
, O
did O
he O
? O

No O
, O
you O
know O
that O
his O
actions O
and O
his O
attitude O
were O
the O
same O
as O
ours O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
that O
we O
have O
been O
defending O
ourselves O
to O
you O
all O
this O
time O
? O

No O
, O
we O
say O
these O
things O
in O
Christ O
and O
before O
God O
. O

You O
are O
our O
dear O
friends O
, O
and O
everything O
we O
do O
is O
to O
make O
you O
stronger O
. O

I O
do O
this O
because O
I O
am O
afraid O
that O
when O
I O
come O
, O
you O
will O
not O
be O
what O
I O
want O
you O
to O
be O
. O

And O
I O
am O
afraid O
that O
I O
will O
not O
be O
what O
you O
want O
me O
to O
be O
. O

I O
am O
afraid O
that O
I O
will O
find O
arguing O
, O
jealousy O
, O
anger O
, O
selfish O
fighting O
, O
evil O
talk O
, O
gossip O
, O
pride O
, O
and O
confusion O
there O
. O

I O
am O
afraid O
that O
when O
I O
come O
to O
you O
again O
, O
my O
God O
will O
make O
me O
humble O
before O
you O
. O

I O
may O
have O
to O
cry O
over O
the O
loss O
of O
some O
who O
sinned O
before O
. O

Many O
of O
them O
have O
still O
not O
changed O
their O
hearts O
to O
be O
sorry O
for O
their O
evil O
lives O
, O
their O
sexual O
sins O
, O
and O
the O
shameful O
things O
they O
have O
done O
. O

So O
I O
decided O
that O
my O
next O
visit O
to O
you O
would O
not O
be O
another O
visit O
to O
make O
you O
sad O
. O

If O
I O
make O
you O
sad O
, O
then O
who O
will O
make O
me O
happy O
? O

Only O
you O
can O
make O
me O
happy O
-- O
you O
, O
the O
ones O
I O
made O
sad O
. O

I O
wrote O
you O
a O
letter O
so O
that O
when O
I O
came O
to O
you O
I O
would O
not O
be O
made O
sad O
by O
those O
who O
should O
make O
me O
happy O
. O

I O
felt O
sure O
that O
all O
of O
you O
would O
share O
my O
joy O
. O

When O
I O
wrote O
to O
you O
before O
, O
I O
was O
very O
troubled O
and O
my O
heart O
was O
full O
of O
sadness O
. O

I O
wrote O
with O
many O
tears O
. O

I O
did O
not O
write O
to O
make O
you O
sad O
, O
but O
to O
let O
you O
know O
how O
much O
I O
love O
you O
. O

Someone O
in O
your O
group O
has O
caused O
sadness O
-- O
not O
to O
me O
, O
but O
to O
all O
of O
you O
. O

I O
mean O
he O
has O
caused O
sadness O
to O
all O
in O
some O
way O
. O

-LRB- O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
make O
it O
sound O
worse O
than O
it O
really O
is O
. O
-RRB- O

The O
punishment O
that O
most O
of O
your O
group O
gave O
him O
is O
enough O
for O
him O
. O

But O
now O
you O
should O
forgive O
him O
and O
encourage O
him O
. O

This O
will O
keep O
him O
from O
having O
too O
much O
sadness O
and O
giving O
up O
completely O
. O

So O
I O
beg O
you O
to O
show O
him O
that O
you O
love O
him O
. O

This O
is O
why O
I O
wrote O
to O
you O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
test O
you O
and O
see O
if O
you O
obey O
in O
everything O
. O

If O
you O
forgive O
someone O
, O
then O
I O
also O
forgive O
them O
. O

And O
what O
I O
have O
forgiven O
-- O
if O
I O
had O
anything O
to O
forgive O
-- O
I O
forgave O
it O
for O
you O
, O
and O
Christ O
was O
with O
me O
. O

I O
did O
this O
so O
that O
Satan O
would O
not O
win O
anything O
from O
us O
. O

We O
know O
very O
well O
what O
his O
plans O
are O
. O

I O
went O
to O
Troas O
to O
tell O
people O
the O
Good O
News O
of O
Christ O
. O

The O
Lord O
gave O
me O
a O
good O
opportunity O
there O
. O

But O
I O
had O
no O
peace O
because O
I O
did O
not O
find O
my O
brother O
Titus O
. O

So O
I O
said O
goodbye O
and O
went O
to O
Macedonia O
. O

But O
thanks O
be O
to O
God O
, O
who O
always O
leads O
us O
in O
victory O
through O
Christ O
. O

God O
uses O
us O
to O
spread O
his O
knowledge O
everywhere O
like O
a O
sweet O
- O
smelling O
perfume O
. O

Our O
offering O
to O
God O
is O
to O
be O
the O
perfume O
of O
Christ O
that O
goes O
out O
to O
those O
who O
are O
being O
saved O
and O
to O
those O
who O
are O
being O
lost O
. O

To O
those O
who O
are O
being O
lost O
, O
this O
perfume O
smells O
like O
death O
, O
and O
it O
brings O
them O
death O
. O

But O
to O
those O
who O
are O
being O
saved O
, O
it O
has O
the O
sweet O
smell O
of O
life O
, O
and O
it O
brings O
them O
life O
. O

So O
who O
is O
good O
enough O
to O
do O
this O
work O
? O

Certainly O
not O
those O
who O
are O
out O
there O
selling O
God O
's O
message O
for O
a O
profit O
! O

But O
we O
do O
n't O
do O
that O
. O

With O
Christ O
's O
help O
we O
speak O
God O
's O
truth O
honestly O
, O
knowing O
that O
we O
must O
answer O
to O
him O
. O

I O
wish O
you O
would O
be O
patient O
with O
me O
even O
when O
I O
am O
a O
little O
foolish O
. O

But O
you O
are O
already O
patient O
with O
me O
. O

I O
am O
jealous O
for O
you O
with O
a O
jealousy O
that O
comes O
from O
God O
. O

I O
promised O
to O
give O
you O
to O
Christ O
. O

He O
must O
be O
your O
only O
husband O
. O

I O
want O
to O
give O
you O
to O
Christ O
to O
be O
his O
pure O
bride O
. O

But O
I O
am O
afraid O
that O
your O
minds O
will O
be O
led O
away O
from O
your O
true O
and O
pure O
following O
of O
Christ O
. O

This O
could O
happen O
just O
as O
Eve O
was O
tricked O
by O
that O
snake O
with O
his O
clever O
lies O
. O

You O
seem O
to O
be O
quite O
patient O
with O
anyone O
who O
comes O
to O
you O
and O
tells O
you O
about O
a O
Jesus O
that O
is O
different O
from O
the O
Jesus O
we O
told O
you O
about O
. O

You O
seem O
very O
willing O
to O
accept O
a O
spirit O
or O
a O
message O
that O
is O
different O
from O
the O
Spirit O
and O
message O
that O
you O
received O
from O
us O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
those O
`` O
super O
apostles O
'' O
are O
any O
better O
than O
I O
am O
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
I O
am O
not O
a O
trained O
speaker O
, O
but O
I O
do O
have O
knowledge O
. O

We O
have O
shown O
this O
to O
you O
clearly O
in O
every O
way O
. O

I O
did O
the O
work O
of O
telling O
God O
's O
Good O
News O
to O
you O
without O
pay O
. O

I O
humbled O
myself O
to O
make O
you O
important O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
that O
was O
wrong O
? O

I O
accepted O
pay O
from O
other O
churches O
. O

I O
took O
their O
money O
so O
that O
I O
could O
serve O
you O
. O

If O
I O
needed O
something O
when O
I O
was O
with O
you O
, O
I O
did O
not O
trouble O
any O
of O
you O
. O

The O
brothers O
who O
came O
from O
Macedonia O
gave O
me O
all O
that O
I O
needed O
. O

I O
did O
not O
allow O
myself O
to O
be O
a O
burden O
to O
you O
in O
any O
way O
. O

And O
I O
will O
never O
be O
a O
burden O
to O
you O
. O

No O
one O
there O
in O
Achaia O
will O
stop O
me O
from O
boasting O
about O
that O
. O

I O
say O
this O
with O
the O
truth O
of O
Christ O
in O
me O
. O

And O
why O
do O
I O
not O
burden O
you O
? O

Do O
you O
think O
it O
is O
because O
I O
do O
n't O
love O
you O
? O

God O
knows O
that O
I O
love O
you O
. O

And O
I O
will O
continue O
doing O
what O
I O
am O
doing O
now O
, O
because O
I O
want O
to O
stop O
those O
people O
from O
having O
a O
reason O
to O
boast O
. O

They O
would O
like O
to O
say O
that O
the O
work O
they O
boast O
about O
is O
the O
same O
as O
ours O
. O

They O
are O
false O
apostles O
, O
lying O
workers O
. O

They O
only O
pretend O
to O
be O
apostles O
of O
Christ O
. O

That O
does O
not O
surprise O
us O
, O
because O
even O
Satan O
changes O
himself O
to O
look O
like O
an O
angel O
of O
light O
. O

So O
it O
does O
not O
surprise O
us O
if O
Satan O
's O
servants O
make O
themselves O
look O
like O
servants O
who O
work O
for O
what O
is O
right O
. O

But O
in O
the O
end O
those O
people O
will O
get O
the O
punishment O
they O
deserve O
. O

I O
tell O
you O
again O
: O
No O
one O
should O
think O
that O
I O
am O
a O
fool O
. O

But O
if O
you O
think O
I O
am O
a O
fool O
, O
then O
accept O
me O
as O
you O
would O
accept O
a O
fool O
. O

Then O
I O
can O
boast O
a O
little O
too O
. O

But O
I O
am O
not O
talking O
the O
way O
the O
Lord O
would O
talk O
. O

I O
am O
boasting O
like O
a O
fool O
. O

Others O
are O
boasting O
about O
their O
lives O
in O
the O
world O
. O

So O
I O
will O
boast O
too O
. O

You O
are O
wise O
, O
so O
you O
will O
gladly O
be O
patient O
with O
fools O
! O

I O
say O
this O
because O
you O
are O
even O
patient O
with O
someone O
who O
forces O
you O
to O
do O
things O
and O
uses O
you O
. O

You O
are O
patient O
with O
those O
who O
trick O
you O
, O
or O
think O
they O
are O
better O
than O
you O
, O
or O
hit O
you O
in O
the O
face O
! O

I O
am O
ashamed O
to O
say O
it O
, O
but O
we O
were O
too O
`` O

weak O
'' O
to O
do O
such O
things O
to O
you O
. O

But O
if O
anyone O
dares O
to O
boast O
, O
I O
will O
too O
. O

almost O
killed O
with O
rocks O
. O

Three O
times O
I O
was O
in O
ships O
that O
were O
wrecked O
, O
and O
one O
of O
those O
times O
I O
spent O
the O
night O
and O
the O
next O
day O
in O
the O
sea O
. O

In O
my O
constant O
traveling O
I O
have O
been O
in O
danger O
from O
rivers O
, O
from O
thieves O
, O
from O
my O
own O
people O
, O
and O
from O
people O
who O
are O
not O
Jews O
. O

I O
have O
been O
in O
danger O
in O
cities O
, O
in O
places O
where O
no O
one O
lives O
, O
and O
on O
the O
sea O
. O

And O
I O
have O
been O
in O
danger O
from O
people O
who O
pretend O
to O
be O
believers O
but O
are O
not O
. O

I O
have O
done O
hard O
and O
tiring O
work O
, O
and O
many O
times O
I O
did O
not O
sleep O
. O

I O
have O
been O
hungry O
and O
thirsty O
. O

Many O
times O
I O
have O
been O
without O
food O
. O

I O
have O
been O
cold O
and O
without O
clothes O
. O

And O
there O
are O
many O
other O
problems O
. O

One O
of O
these O
is O
the O
care O
I O
have O
for O
all O
the O
churches O
. O

I O
worry O
about O
them O
every O
day O
. O

I O
feel O
weak O
every O
time O
another O
person O
is O
weak O
. O

I O
feel O
deeply O
upset O
every O
time O
another O
person O
is O
led O
into O
sin O
. O

If O
I O
must O
boast O
, O
I O
will O
boast O
about O
the O
things O
that O
show O
I O
am O
weak O
. O

God O
knows O
that O
I O
am O
not O
lying O
. O

He O
is O
the O
God O
and O
Father O
of O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
, O
and O
he O
is O
to O
be O
praised O
forever O
. O

When O
I O
was O
in O
Damascus O
, O
the O
governor O
under O
King O
Aretas O
wanted O
to O
arrest O
me O
, O
so O
he O
put O
guards O
around O
the O
city O
. O

But O
some O
friends O
put O
me O
in O
a O
basket O
. O

Then O
they O
put O
the O
basket O
through O
a O
hole O
in O
the O
wall O
and O
lowered O
me O
down O
. O

So O
I O
escaped O
from O
the O
governor O
. O

Greetings O
from O
Paul O
, O
an O
apostle O
of O
Christ O
Jesus O
. O

I O
am O
an O
apostle O
because O
that O
is O
what O
God O
wanted O
. O

Greetings O
also O
from O
Timothy O
our O
brother O
in O
Christ O
. O

To O
God O
's O
church O
in O
Corinth O
and O
to O
all O
of O
God O
's O
holy O
people O
throughout O
Achaia O
. O

Grace O
and O
peace O
to O
you O
from O
God O
our O
Father O
and O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

Praise O
be O
to O
the O
God O
and O
Father O
of O
our O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

He O
is O
the O
Father O
who O
is O
full O
of O
mercy O
, O
the O
God O
of O
all O
comfort O
. O

He O
comforts O
us O
every O
time O
we O
have O
trouble O
so O
that O
when O
others O
have O
trouble O
, O
we O
can O
comfort O
them O
with O
the O
same O
comfort O
God O
gives O
us O
. O

We O
share O
in O
the O
many O
sufferings O
of O
Christ O
. O

In O
the O
same O
way O
, O
much O
comfort O
comes O
to O
us O
through O
Christ O
. O

If O
we O
have O
troubles O
, O
it O
is O
for O
your O
comfort O
and O
salvation O
. O

If O
we O
are O
comforted O
, O
it O
is O
so O
that O
we O
can O
comfort O
you O
. O

And O
this O
helps O
you O
patiently O
accept O
the O
same O
sufferings O
we O
have O
. O

Our O
hope O
for O
you O
is O
strong O
. O

We O
know O
that O
you O
share O
in O
our O
sufferings O
. O

So O
we O
know O
that O
you O
also O
share O
in O
our O
comfort O
. O

Brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
we O
want O
you O
to O
know O
about O
the O
trouble O
we O
suffered O
in O
Asia O
. O

We O
had O
great O
burdens O
there O
, O
which O
were O
greater O
than O
our O
own O
strength O
. O

We O
even O
gave O
up O
hope O
for O
life O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
seems O
like O
God O
has O
been O
telling O
us O
we O
are O
going O
to O
die O
. O

But O
this O
is O
so O
that O
we O
will O
not O
trust O
in O
ourselves O
but O
in O
God O
, O
who O
raises O
people O
from O
death O
. O

He O
saved O
us O
from O
these O
great O
dangers O
of O
death O
, O
and O
he O
will O
continue O
to O
save O
us O
. O

We O
feel O
sure O
he O
will O
always O
save O
us O
. O

And O
you O
can O
help O
us O
with O
your O
prayers O
. O

Then O
many O
people O
will O
give O
thanks O
for O
us O
-- O
that O
God O
blessed O
us O
because O
of O
their O
many O
prayers O
. O

This O
is O
what O
we O
are O
proud O
of O
, O
and O
I O
can O
say O
with O
a O
clear O
conscience O
that O
it O
is O
true O
: O
In O
everything O
we O
have O
done O
in O
the O
world O
, O
we O
have O
done O
it O
with O
an O
honest O
and O
pure O
heart O
from O
God O
. O

And O
this O
is O
even O
truer O
in O
what O
we O
have O
done O
with O
you O
. O

We O
did O
this O
by O
God O
's O
grace O
, O
not O
by O
the O
kind O
of O
wisdom O
the O
world O
has O
. O

We O
write O
to O
you O
only O
what O
you O
can O
read O
and O
understand O
. O

And O
I O
hope O
you O
will O
fully O
understand O
, O
just O
as O
you O
already O
understand O
many O
things O
about O
us O
. O

I O
hope O
you O
will O
understand O
that O
you O
can O
be O
proud O
of O
us O
, O
just O
as O
we O
will O
be O
proud O
of O
you O
on O
the O
day O
when O
our O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
comes O
again O
. O

I O
was O
very O
sure O
of O
all O
this O
. O

That O
is O
why O
I O
made O
plans O
to O
visit O
you O
first O
. O

Then O
you O
could O
be O
blessed O
twice O
. O

I O
planned O
to O
visit O
you O
on O
my O
way O
to O
Macedonia O
and O
again O
on O
my O
way O
back O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
get O
help O
from O
you O
for O
my O
trip O
to O
Judea O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
that O
I O
made O
these O
plans O
without O
really O
thinking O
? O

Or O
maybe O
you O
think O
I O
make O
plans O
as O
the O
world O
does O
, O
saying O
yes O
and O
no O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

But O
if O
you O
can O
believe O
God O
, O
then O
you O
can O
believe O
that O
what O
we O
tell O
you O
is O
never O
both O
yes O
and O
no O
. O

The O
Son O
of O
God O
, O
Jesus O
Christ O
, O
the O
one O
that O
Silas O
, O
Timothy O
, O
and O
I O
told O
you O
about O
was O
not O
yes O
and O
no O
. O

In O
Christ O
it O
has O
always O
been O
yes O
. O

The O
yes O
to O
all O
of O
God O
's O
promises O
is O
in O
Christ O
. O

And O
that O
is O
why O
we O
say O
`` O
Amen O
'' O
through O
Christ O
to O
the O
glory O
of O
God O
. O

And O
God O
is O
the O
one O
who O
makes O
you O
and O
us O
strong O
in O
Christ O
. O

God O
is O
also O
the O
one O
who O
chose O
us O
for O
his O
work O
. O

He O
put O
his O
mark O
on O
us O
to O
show O
that O
we O
are O
his O
. O

Yes O
, O
he O
put O
his O
Spirit O
in O
our O
hearts O
as O
the O
first O
payment O
that O
guarantees O
all O
that O
he O
will O
give O
us O
. O

I O
tell O
you O
this O
, O
and O
I O
ask O
God O
to O
be O
my O
witness O
that O
this O
is O
true O
: O
The O
reason O
I O
did O
not O
come O
back O
to O
Corinth O
was O
that O
I O
did O
not O
want O
to O
punish O
or O
hurt O
you O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
mean O
that O
we O
are O
trying O
to O
control O
your O
faith O
. O

You O
are O
strong O
in O
faith O
. O

But O
we O
are O
workers O
with O
you O
for O
your O
own O
happiness O
. O

God O
, O
with O
his O
mercy O
, O
gave O
us O
this O
work O
to O
do O
, O
so O
we O
do O
n't O
give O
up O
. O

But O
we O
have O
turned O
away O
from O
secret O
and O
shameful O
ways O
. O

We O
do O
n't O
use O
trickery O
, O
and O
we O
do O
n't O
change O
the O
teaching O
of O
God O
. O

We O
teach O
the O
truth O
plainly O
. O

This O
is O
how O
we O
show O
people O
who O
we O
are O
. O

And O
this O
is O
how O
they O
can O
know O
in O
their O
hearts O
what O
kind O
of O
people O
we O
are O
before O
God O
. O

The O
Good O
News O
that O
we O
tell O
people O
may O
be O
hidden O
, O
but O
it O
is O
hidden O
only O
to O
those O
who O
are O
lost O
. O

The O
ruler O
of O
this O
world O
has O
blinded O
the O
minds O
of O
those O
who O
do O
n't O
believe O
. O

They O
can O
not O
see O
the O
light O
of O
the O
Good O
News O
-- O
the O
message O
about O
the O
divine O
greatness O
of O
Christ O
. O

Christ O
is O
the O
one O
who O
is O
exactly O
like O
God O
. O

We O
do O
n't O
tell O
people O
about O
ourselves O
. O

But O
we O
tell O
people O
that O
Jesus O
Christ O
is O
Lord O
, O
and O
we O
tell O
them O
that O
we O
are O
your O
servants O
for O
Jesus O
. O

God O
once O
said O
, O
`` O
Let O
light O
shine O
out O
of O
the O
darkness O
! O
'' O

And O
this O
is O
the O
same O
God O
who O
made O
his O
light O
shine O
in O
our O
hearts O
to O
let O
us O
know O
that O
his O
own O
divine O
greatness O
is O
seen O
in O
the O
face O
of O
Christ O
. O

We O
have O
this O
treasure O
from O
God O
, O
but O
we O
are O
only O
like O
clay O
jars O
that O
hold O
the O
treasure O
. O

This O
is O
to O
show O
that O
the O
amazing O
power O
we O
have O
is O
from O
God O
, O
not O
from O
us O
. O

We O
have O
troubles O
all O
around O
us O
, O
but O
we O
are O
not O
defeated O
. O

We O
often O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
to O
do O
, O
but O
we O
do O
n't O
give O
up O
. O

We O
are O
persecuted O
, O
but O
God O
does O
not O
leave O
us O
. O

We O
are O
hurt O
sometimes O
, O
but O
we O
are O
not O
destroyed O
. O

So O
we O
constantly O
experience O
the O
death O
of O
Jesus O
in O
our O
own O
bodies O
, O
but O
this O
is O
so O
that O
the O
life O
of O
Jesus O
can O
also O
be O
seen O
in O
our O
bodies O
. O

We O
are O
alive O
, O
but O
for O
Jesus O
we O
are O
always O
in O
danger O
of O
death O
, O
so O
that O
the O
life O
of O
Jesus O
can O
be O
seen O
in O
our O
bodies O
that O
die O
. O

So O
death O
is O
working O
in O
us O
, O
but O
the O
result O
is O
that O
life O
is O
working O
in O
you O
. O

The O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
I O
believed O
, O
so O
I O
spoke O
. O
'' O

Our O
faith O
is O
like O
that O
too O
. O

We O
believe O
, O
and O
so O
we O
speak O
. O

God O
raised O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
from O
death O
, O
and O
we O
know O
that O
he O
will O
also O
raise O
us O
with O
Jesus O
. O

God O
will O
bring O
us O
together O
with O
you O
, O
and O
we O
will O
stand O
before O
him O
. O

All O
these O
things O
are O
for O
you O
. O

And O
so O
the O
grace O
of O
God O
is O
being O
given O
to O
more O
and O
more O
people O
. O

This O
will O
bring O
more O
and O
more O
thanks O
to O
God O
for O
his O
glory O
. O

That O
is O
why O
we O
never O
give O
up O
. O

Our O
physical O
body O
is O
becoming O
older O
and O
weaker O
, O
but O
our O
spirit O
inside O
us O
is O
made O
new O
every O
day O
. O

We O
have O
small O
troubles O
for O
a O
while O
now O
, O
but O
these O
troubles O
are O
helping O
us O
gain O
an O
eternal O
glory O
. O

That O
eternal O
glory O
is O
much O
greater O
than O
our O
troubles O
. O

So O
we O
think O
about O
what O
we O
can O
not O
see O
, O
not O
what O
we O
see O
. O

What O
we O
see O
lasts O
only O
a O
short O
time O
, O
and O
what O
we O
can O
not O
see O
will O
last O
forever O
. O

This O
will O
be O
my O
third O
time O
to O
visit O
you O
. O

And O
remember O
, O
`` O
For O
every O
complaint O
there O
must O
be O
two O
or O
three O
people O
to O
say O
that O
they O
know O
it O
is O
true O
. O
'' O

When O
I O
was O
with O
you O
the O
second O
time O
, O
I O
gave O
a O
warning O
to O
those O
who O
had O
sinned O
. O

I O
am O
not O
there O
now O
, O
but O
I O
am O
giving O
another O
warning O
to O
them O
and O
to O
anyone O
else O
who O
has O
sinned O
: O
When O
I O
come O
to O
you O
again O
, O
I O
will O
punish O
you O
. O

You O
want O
proof O
that O
Christ O
is O
speaking O
through O
me O
. O

My O
proof O
is O
that O
he O
is O
not O
weak O
in O
dealing O
with O
you O
but O
is O
showing O
his O
power O
among O
you O
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
Christ O
was O
weak O
when O
he O
was O
killed O
on O
the O
cross O
, O
but O
he O
lives O
now O
by O
God O
's O
power O
. O

It O
is O
also O
true O
that O
we O
share O
his O
weakness O
, O
but O
in O
dealing O
with O
you O
we O
will O
be O
alive O
in O
him O
by O
God O
's O
power O
. O

Look O
closely O
at O
yourselves O
. O

Test O
yourselves O
to O
see O
if O
you O
are O
living O
in O
the O
faith O
. O

Do O
n't O
you O
realize O
that O
Christ O
Jesus O
is O
in O
you O
? O

Of O
course O
, O
if O
you O
fail O
the O
test O
, O
he O
is O
not O
in O
you O
. O

But O
I O
hope O
you O
will O
see O
that O
we O
have O
not O
failed O
the O
test O
. O

We O
pray O
to O
God O
that O
you O
will O
not O
do O
anything O
wrong O
. O

Our O
concern O
here O
is O
not O
for O
people O
to O
see O
that O
we O
have O
passed O
the O
test O
in O
our O
work O
with O
you O
. O

Our O
main O
concern O
is O
that O
you O
do O
what O
is O
right O
, O
even O
if O
it O
looks O
as O
if O
we O
have O
failed O
the O
test O
. O

We O
can O
not O
do O
anything O
that O
is O
against O
the O
truth O
but O
only O
what O
promotes O
the O
truth O
. O

We O
are O
happy O
to O
be O
weak O
if O
you O
are O
strong O
. O

And O
this O
is O
what O
we O
pray O
-- O
that O
your O
lives O
will O
be O
made O
completely O
right O
again O
. O

I O
'm O
writing O
this O
before O
I O
come O
so O
that O
when O
I O
am O
there O
I O
will O
not O
have O
to O
use O
my O
authority O
to O
punish O
you O
. O

The O
Lord O
gave O
me O
that O
authority O
to O
make O
you O
stronger O
, O
not O
to O
destroy O
you O
. O

Now O
, O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
be O
filled O
with O
joy O
. O

Try O
to O
make O
everything O
right O
, O
and O
do O
what O
I O
have O
asked O
you O
to O
do O
. O

Agree O
with O
each O
other O
, O
and O
live O
in O
peace O
. O

Then O
the O
God O
of O
love O
and O
peace O
will O
be O
with O
you O
. O

Give O
each O
other O
the O
special O
greeting O
of O
God O
's O
people O
. O

All O
of O
God O
's O
holy O
people O
here O
send O
you O
their O
greetings O
. O

I O
pray O
that O
you O
will O
enjoy O
the O
grace O
of O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
, O
the O
love O
of O
God O
, O
and O
the O
fellowship O
of O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
. O

We O
are O
workers O
together O
with O
God O
. O

So O
we O
beg O
you O
: O
Do O
n't O
let O
the O
grace O
that O
you O
received O
from O
God O
be O
for O
nothing O
. O

God O
says O
, O
`` O
I O
heard O
you O
at O
the O
right O
time O
, O
and O
I O
gave O
you O
help O
on O
the O
day O
of O
salvation O
. O
'' O

I O
tell O
you O
that O
the O
`` O
right O
time O
'' O
is O
now O
. O

The O
`` O
day O
of O
salvation O
'' O
is O
now O
. O

We O
do O
n't O
want O
people O
to O
find O
anything O
wrong O
with O
our O
work O
. O

So O
we O
do O
nothing O
that O
will O
be O
a O
problem O
to O
others O
. O

But O
in O
every O
way O
we O
show O
that O
we O
are O
servants O
of O
God O
. O

We O
never O
give O
up O
, O
even O
though O
we O
face O
troubles O
, O
difficulties O
, O
and O
problems O
of O
every O
kind O
. O

We O
are O
beaten O
and O
thrown O
into O
prison O
. O

People O
get O
upset O
at O
us O
and O
fight O
against O
us O
. O

We O
work O
hard O
, O
and O
sometimes O
we O
get O
no O
sleep O
or O
food O
. O

We O
show O
that O
we O
are O
God O
's O
servants O
by O
our O
pure O
lives O
, O
by O
our O
understanding O
, O
by O
our O
patience O
, O
and O
by O
our O
kindness O
. O

We O
show O
it O
by O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
, O
by O
genuine O
love O
, O
by O
speaking O
the O
truth O
, O
and O
by O
depending O
on O
God O
's O
power O
. O

This O
right O
way O
of O
living O
has O
prepared O
us O
to O
defend O
ourselves O
against O
every O
kind O
of O
attack O
. O

Some O
people O
honor O
us O
, O
but O
others O
shame O
us O
. O

Some O
people O
say O
good O
things O
about O
us O
, O
but O
others O
say O
bad O
things O
. O

Some O
people O
say O
we O
are O
liars O
, O
but O
we O
speak O
the O
truth O
. O

To O
some O
people O
we O
are O
not O
known O
, O
but O
we O
are O
well O
known O
. O

We O
seem O
to O
be O
dying O
, O
but O
look O
! O

We O
continue O
to O
live O
. O

We O
are O
punished O
, O
but O
we O
are O
not O
killed O
. O

We O
have O
much O
sadness O
, O
but O
we O
are O
always O
rejoicing O
. O

We O
are O
poor O
, O
but O
we O
are O
making O
many O
people O
rich O
in O
faith O
. O

We O
have O
nothing O
, O
but O
really O
we O
have O
everything O
. O

We O
have O
spoken O
freely O
to O
you O
people O
in O
Corinth O
. O

We O
have O
opened O
our O
hearts O
to O
you O
. O

Our O
feelings O
of O
love O
for O
you O
have O
not O
stopped O
. O

It O
is O
you O
who O
have O
stopped O
your O
feelings O
of O
love O
for O
us O
. O

I O
speak O
to O
you O
as O
if O
you O
were O
my O
children O
. O

Do O
the O
same O
as O
we O
have O
done O
-- O
open O
your O
hearts O
also O
. O

You O
are O
not O
the O
same O
as O
those O
who O
do O
n't O
believe O
. O

So O
do O
n't O
join O
yourselves O
to O
them O
. O

Good O
and O
evil O
do O
n't O
belong O
together O
. O

Light O
and O
darkness O
can O
not O
share O
the O
same O
room O
. O

How O
can O
there O
be O
any O
unity O
between O
Christ O
and O
the O
devil O
? O

What O
does O
a O
believer O
have O
in O
common O
with O
an O
unbeliever O
? O

God O
's O
temple O
can O
not O
have O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
idols O
, O
and O
we O
are O
the O
temple O
of O
the O
living O
God O
. O

As O
God O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
will O
live O
with O
them O
and O
walk O
with O
them O
; O
I O
will O
be O
their O
God O
, O
and O
they O
will O
be O
my O
people O
. O
'' O

`` O
So O
come O
away O
from O
those O
people O
and O
separate O
yourselves O
from O
them O
, O
says O
the O
Lord O
. O

Do O
n't O
touch O
anything O
that O
is O
not O
clean O
, O
and O
I O
will O
accept O
you O
. O
'' O

`` O
I O
will O
be O
your O
father O
, O
and O
you O
will O
be O
my O
sons O
and O
daughters O
, O
says O
the O
Lord O
All O
- O
Powerful O
. O
'' O

And O
now O
, O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
we O
want O
you O
to O
know O
about O
the O
grace O
that O
God O
gave O
the O
churches O
in O
Macedonia O
. O

Those O
believers O
have O
been O
tested O
by O
great O
troubles O
, O
and O
they O
are O
very O
poor O
. O

But O
they O
gave O
much O
because O
of O
their O
great O
joy O
. O

I O
can O
tell O
you O
that O
they O
gave O
as O
much O
as O
they O
were O
able O
and O
even O
more O
than O
they O
could O
afford O
. O

No O
one O
told O
them O
to O
do O
this O
. O

It O
was O
their O
idea O
. O

But O
they O
asked O
us O
again O
and O
again O
-- O
they O
begged O
us O
to O
let O
them O
share O
in O
this O
service O
for O
God O
's O
people O
. O

And O
they O
gave O
in O
a O
way O
that O
we O
did O
not O
expect O
: O

They O
gave O
themselves O
to O
the O
Lord O
and O
to O
us O
before O
they O
gave O
their O
money O
. O

This O
is O
what O
God O
wants O
. O

So O
we O
asked O
Titus O
to O
help O
you O
finish O
this O
special O
work O
of O
giving O
. O

He O
is O
the O
one O
who O
started O
this O
work O
. O

You O
are O
rich O
in O
everything O
-- O
in O
faith O
, O
in O
speaking O
ability O
, O
in O
knowledge O
, O
in O
the O
willingness O
to O
help O
, O
and O
in O
the O
love O
you O
learned O
from O
us O
. O

And O
so O
we O
want O
you O
to O
also O
be O
rich O
in O
this O
work O
of O
giving O
. O

I O
am O
not O
ordering O
you O
to O
give O
, O
but O
I O
want O
to O
see O
how O
real O
your O
love O
is O
by O
comparing O
you O
with O
others O
who O
have O
been O
so O
ready O
and O
willing O
to O
help O
. O

You O
know O
the O
grace O
of O
our O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

You O
know O
that O
he O
gave O
up O
his O
heavenly O
riches O
for O
you O
. O

He O
gave O
up O
everything O
so O
that O
you O
could O
be O
richly O
blessed O
. O

This O
is O
what O
I O
think O
you O
should O
do O
: O
Last O
year O
you O
were O
the O
first O
to O
want O
to O
give O
, O
and O
you O
were O
the O
first O
who O
gave O
. O

So O
now O
finish O
the O
work O
you O
started O
. O

Then O
your O
`` O
doing O
'' O
will O
be O
equal O
to O
your O
`` O
wanting O
to O
do O
. O
'' O

Give O
from O
what O
you O
have O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
give O
, O
your O
gift O
will O
be O
accepted O
. O

Your O
gift O
will O
be O
judged O
by O
what O
you O
have O
, O
not O
by O
what O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
. O

We O
do O
n't O
want O
you O
to O
have O
troubles O
while O
others O
are O
comforted O
. O

We O
want O
everything O
to O
be O
equal O
. O

At O
this O
time O
you O
have O
plenty O
and O
can O
provide O
what O
they O
need O
. O

Then O
later O
, O
when O
they O
have O
plenty O
, O
they O
can O
provide O
what O
you O
need O
. O

Then O
everyone O
will O
have O
an O
equal O
share O
. O

As O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
Those O
who O
gathered O
much O
did O
not O
have O
too O
much O
, O
and O
those O
who O
gathered O
little O
did O
not O
have O
too O
little O
. O
'' O

I O
thank O
God O
because O
he O
gave O
Titus O
the O
same O
love O
for O
you O
that O
I O
have O
. O

Titus O
agreed O
to O
do O
what O
we O
asked O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
he O
himself O
wanted O
very O
much O
to O
come O
see O
you O
. O

We O
are O
sending O
with O
Titus O
the O
brother O
who O
is O
praised O
by O
all O
the O
churches O
. O

He O
is O
praised O
because O
of O
his O
service O
to O
the O
Good O
News O
. O

Also O
, O
he O
was O
chosen O
by O
the O
churches O
to O
go O
with O
us O
when O
we O
carry O
this O
gift O
. O

We O
are O
doing O
this O
service O
to O
bring O
honor O
to O
the O
Lord O
and O
to O
show O
that O
we O
really O
want O
to O
help O
. O

We O
are O
being O
careful O
so O
that O
no O
one O
will O
criticize O
us O
about O
the O
way O
we O
are O
caring O
for O
this O
large O
gift O
. O

We O
are O
trying O
to O
do O
what O
is O
right O
. O

We O
want O
to O
do O
what O
the O
Lord O
accepts O
as O
right O
and O
also O
what O
people O
think O
is O
right O
. O

Also O
, O
we O
are O
sending O
with O
them O
our O
brother O
who O
is O
always O
ready O
to O
help O
. O

He O
has O
proved O
this O
to O
us O
in O
many O
ways O
. O

And O
he O
wants O
to O
help O
even O
more O
now O
because O
he O
has O
much O
faith O
in O
you O
. O

Now O
about O
Titus O
-- O
he O
is O
my O
partner O
. O

He O
is O
working O
together O
with O
me O
to O
help O
you O
. O

And O
about O
the O
other O
brothers O
-- O
they O
are O
sent O
from O
the O
churches O
, O
and O
they O
bring O
honor O
to O
Christ O
. O

So O
show O
these O
men O
that O
you O
really O
have O
love O
. O

Show O
them O
why O
we O
are O
proud O
of O
you O
. O

Then O
all O
the O
churches O
can O
see O
it O
. O

Why O
are O
we O
beginning O
again O
to O
tell O
you O
all O
these O
good O
things O
about O
ourselves O
? O

Do O
we O
need O
letters O
of O
introduction O
to O
you O
or O
from O
you O
, O
like O
some O
other O
people O
? O

No O
, O
you O
yourselves O
are O
our O
letter O
, O
written O
on O
our O
hearts O
. O

It O
is O
known O
and O
read O
by O
all O
people O
. O

You O
show O
that O
you O
are O
a O
letter O
from O
Christ O
that O
he O
sent O
through O
us O
. O

This O
letter O
is O
not O
written O
with O
ink O
but O
with O
the O
Spirit O
of O
the O
living O
God O
. O

It O
is O
not O
written O
on O
stone O
tablets O
but O
on O
human O
hearts O
. O

We O
can O
say O
this O
, O
because O
through O
Christ O
we O
feel O
sure O
before O
God O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
mean O
that O
we O
are O
able O
to O
do O
anything O
good O
ourselves O
. O

It O
is O
God O
who O
makes O
us O
able O
to O
do O
all O
that O
we O
do O
. O

He O
made O
us O
able O
to O
be O
servants O
of O
a O
new O
agreement O
from O
himself O
to O
his O
people O
. O

It O
is O
not O
an O
agreement O
of O
written O
laws O
, O
but O
it O
is O
of O
the O
Spirit O
. O

The O
written O
law O
brings O
death O
, O
but O
the O
Spirit O
gives O
life O
. O

The O
old O
agreement O
that O
brought O
death O
, O
written O
with O
words O
on O
stone O
, O
came O
with O
God O
's O
glory O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
face O
of O
Moses O
was O
so O
bright O
with O
glory O
-LRB- O
a O
glory O
that O
was O
ending O
-RRB- O
that O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
could O
not O
continue O
looking O
at O
his O
face O
. O

So O
surely O
the O
new O
agreement O
that O
comes O
from O
the O
life O
- O
giving O
Spirit O
has O
even O
more O
glory O
. O

This O
is O
what O
I O
mean O
: O
That O
old O
agreement O
judged O
people O
guilty O
of O
sin O
, O
but O
it O
had O
glory O
. O

So O
surely O
the O
new O
agreement O
that O
makes O
people O
right O
with O
God O
has O
much O
greater O
glory O
. O

That O
old O
agreement O
had O
glory O
. O

But O
it O
really O
loses O
its O
glory O
when O
it O
is O
compared O
to O
the O
much O
greater O
glory O
of O
the O
new O
agreement O
. O

If O
the O
agreement O
that O
was O
brought O
to O
an O
end O
came O
with O
glory O
, O
then O
the O
agreement O
that O
never O
ends O
has O
much O
greater O
glory O
. O

We O
are O
so O
sure O
of O
this O
hope O
that O
we O
can O
speak O
very O
openly O
. O

We O
are O
not O
like O
Moses O
, O
who O
put O
a O
covering O
over O
his O
face O
. O

He O
covered O
his O
face O
so O
that O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
would O
not O
see O
it O
. O

The O
glory O
was O
disappearing O
, O
and O
Moses O
did O
not O
want O
them O
to O
see O
it O
end O
. O

But O
their O
minds O
were O
closed O
. O

And O
even O
today O
, O
when O
those O
people O
read O
the O
writings O
of O
the O
old O
agreement O
, O
that O
same O
covering O
hides O
the O
meaning O
. O

That O
covering O
has O
not O
been O
removed O
for O
them O
. O

It O
is O
taken O
away O
only O
through O
Christ O
. O

Yes O
, O
even O
today O
, O
when O
they O
read O
the O
Law O
of O
Moses O
, O
there O
is O
a O
covering O
over O
their O
minds O
. O

But O
when O
someone O
changes O
and O
follows O
the O
Lord O
, O
that O
covering O
is O
taken O
away O
. O

The O
Lord O
is O
the O
Spirit O
, O
and O
where O
the O
Spirit O
of O
the O
Lord O
is O
, O
there O
is O
freedom O
. O

And O
our O
faces O
are O
not O
covered O
. O

We O
all O
show O
the O
Lord O
's O
glory O
, O
and O
we O
are O
being O
changed O
to O
be O
like O
him O
. O

This O
change O
in O
us O
brings O
more O
and O
more O
glory O
, O
which O
comes O
from O
the O
Lord O
, O
who O
is O
the O
Spirit O
. O

Greetings O
from O
the O
Elder O
. O

To O
my O
dear O
friend O
Gaius O
, O
a O
person O
I O
truly O
love O
. O

My O
dear O
friend O
, O
I O
know O
that O
you O
are O
doing O
well O
spiritually O
. O

So O
I O
pray O
that O
everything O
else O
is O
going O
well O
with O
you O
and O
that O
you O
are O
enjoying O
good O
health O
. O

Some O
believers O
came O
and O
told O
me O
about O
the O
truth O
in O
your O
life O
. O

They O
told O
me O
that O
you O
continue O
to O
follow O
the O
way O
of O
truth O
. O

This O
made O
me O
very O
happy O
. O

It O
always O
gives O
me O
the O
greatest O
joy O
when O
I O
hear O
that O
my O
children O
are O
following O
the O
way O
of O
truth O
. O

My O
dear O
friend O
, O
it O
is O
good O
that O
you O
continue O
to O
help O
the O
believers O
. O

They O
are O
people O
you O
do O
n't O
even O
know O
. O

They O
told O
the O
church O
about O
the O
love O
you O
have O
. O

Please O
help O
them O
to O
continue O
their O
trip O
. O

Help O
them O
in O
a O
way O
that O
will O
please O
God O
. O

They O
went O
on O
their O
trip O
to O
serve O
Christ O
. O

They O
did O
not O
accept O
any O
help O
from O
people O
who O
are O
not O
believers O
. O

So O
we O
should O
help O
them O
. O

When O
we O
help O
them O
, O
we O
share O
with O
their O
work O
for O
the O
truth O
. O

I O
wrote O
a O
letter O
to O
the O
church O
, O
but O
Diotrephes O
will O
not O
listen O
to O
what O
we O
say O
. O

He O
always O
wants O
to O
be O
the O
leader O
. O

When O
I O
come O
, O
I O
will O
talk O
with O
him O
about O
what O
he O
is O
doing O
. O

He O
lies O
and O
says O
evil O
things O
about O
us O
, O
but O
that O
is O
not O
all O
. O

He O
refuses O
to O
welcome O
and O
help O
the O
believers O
who O
travel O
there O
. O

And O
he O
will O
not O
let O
anyone O
else O
help O
them O
. O

If O
they O
do O
, O
he O
makes O
them O
leave O
the O
church O
. O

My O
dear O
friend O
, O
do O
n't O
follow O
what O
is O
bad O
; O
follow O
what O
is O
good O
. O

Whoever O
does O
what O
is O
good O
is O
from O
God O
. O

But O
whoever O
does O
evil O
has O
never O
known O
God O
. O

Everyone O
says O
good O
things O
about O
Demetrius O
, O
and O
the O
truth O
agrees O
with O
what O
they O
say O
. O

Also O
, O
we O
say O
good O
about O
him O
. O

And O
you O
know O
that O
what O
we O
say O
is O
true O
. O

I O
have O
many O
things O
I O
want O
to O
tell O
you O
. O

But O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
use O
pen O
and O
ink O
. O

I O
hope O
to O
visit O
you O
soon O
. O

Then O
we O
can O
be O
together O
and O
talk O
. O

Peace O
to O
you O
. O

The O
friends O
here O
with O
me O
send O
their O
love O
. O

Please O
give O
our O
love O
to O
each O
one O
of O
the O
friends O
there O

Greetings O
from O
Jude O
, O
a O
servant O
of O
Jesus O
Christ O
and O
a O
brother O
of O
James O
. O

To O
those O
who O
have O
been O
chosen O
and O
are O
loved O
by O
God O
the O
Father O
and O
have O
been O
kept O
safe O
in O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

Mercy O
, O
peace O
, O
and O
love O
be O
yours O
more O
and O
more O
. O

Dear O
friends O
, O
I O
wanted O
very O
much O
to O
write O
to O
you O
about O
the O
salvation O
we O
all O
share O
together O
. O

But O
I O
felt O
the O
need O
to O
write O
to O
you O
about O
something O
else O
: O
I O
want O
to O
encourage O
you O
to O
fight O
hard O
for O
the O
faith O
that O
God O
gave O
his O
holy O
people O
. O

God O
gave O
this O
faith O
once O
, O
and O
it O
is O
good O
for O
all O
time O
. O

Some O
people O
have O
secretly O
entered O
your O
group O
. O

These O
people O
have O
already O
been O
judged O
guilty O
for O
what O
they O
are O
doing O
. O

Long O
ago O
the O
prophets O
wrote O
about O
them O
. O

They O
are O
against O
God O
. O

They O
have O
used O
the O
grace O
of O
our O
God O
in O
the O
wrong O
way O
-- O
to O
do O
sinful O
things O
. O

They O
refuse O
to O
follow O
Jesus O
Christ O
, O
our O
only O
Master O
and O
Lord O
. O

I O
want O
to O
help O
you O
remember O
some O
things O
you O
already O
know O
: O
Remember O
that O
the O
Lord O
saved O
his O
people O
by O
bringing O
them O
out O
of O
the O
land O
of O
Egypt O
. O

But O
later O
he O
destroyed O
all O
those O
who O
did O
not O
believe O
. O

And O
remember O
the O
angels O
who O
lost O
their O
authority O
to O
rule O
. O

They O
left O
their O
proper O
home O
. O

So O
the O
Lord O
has O
kept O
them O
in O
darkness O
, O
bound O
with O
everlasting O
chains O
, O
to O
be O
judged O
on O
the O
great O
day O
. O

Also O
, O
remember O
the O
cities O
of O
Sodom O
and O
Gomorrah O
and O
the O
other O
towns O
around O
them O
. O

Like O
those O
angels O
they O
were O
full O
of O
sexual O
sin O
and O
involved O
themselves O
in O
sexual O
relations O
that O
are O
wrong O
. O

And O
they O
suffer O
the O
punishment O
of O
eternal O
fire O
, O
an O
example O
for O
us O
to O
see O
. O

It O
is O
the O
same O
way O
with O
these O
people O
who O
have O
entered O
your O
group O
. O

They O
are O
guided O
by O
dreams O
. O

They O
make O
themselves O
dirty O
with O
sin O
. O

They O
reject O
God O
's O
authority O
and O
say O
bad O
things O
against O
the O
glorious O
ones O
. O

Not O
even O
the O
archangel O
Michael O
did O
this O
. O

Michael O
argued O
with O
the O
devil O
about O
who O
would O
have O
the O
body O
of O
Moses O
. O

But O
Michael O
did O
not O
dare O
to O
condemn O
even O
the O
devil O
for O
his O
false O
accusations O
. O

Instead O
, O
Michael O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
Lord O
punish O
you O
! O
'' O

But O
these O
people O
criticize O
things O
they O
do O
n't O
understand O
. O

They O
do O
understand O
some O
things O
. O

But O
they O
understand O
these O
things O
not O
by O
thinking O
, O
but O
by O
feeling O
, O
the O
way O
dumb O
animals O
understand O
things O
. O

And O
these O
are O
the O
things O
that O
destroy O
them O
. O

It O
will O
be O
bad O
for O
them O
. O

They O
have O
followed O
the O
way O
that O
Cain O
went O
. O

To O
make O
money O
, O
they O
have O
given O
themselves O
to O
following O
the O
wrong O
way O
that O
Balaam O
went O
. O

They O
have O
fought O
against O
God O
like O
Korah O
did O
. O

And O
like O
Korah O
, O
they O
will O
be O
destroyed O
. O

These O
people O
are O
like O
dirty O
spots O
among O
you O
-- O
they O
bring O
shame O
to O
you O
in O
the O
special O
meals O
you O
share O
together O
. O

They O
eat O
with O
you O
and O
have O
no O
fear O
. O

They O
take O
care O
of O
only O
themselves O
. O

They O
are O
like O
clouds O
without O
rain O
. O

The O
wind O
blows O
them O
around O
. O

They O
are O
like O
trees O
that O
have O
no O
fruit O
at O
harvest O
time O
and O
are O
pulled O
out O
of O
the O
ground O
. O

So O
they O
are O
twice O
dead O
. O

Like O
the O
dirty O
foam O
on O
the O
wild O
waves O
in O
the O
sea O
, O
everyone O
can O
see O
the O
shameful O
things O
they O
do O
. O

They O
are O
like O
stars O
that O
wander O
in O
the O
sky O
. O

A O
place O
in O
the O
blackest O
darkness O
has O
been O
kept O
for O
them O
forever O
. O

Enoch O
, O
the O
seventh O
descendant O
from O
Adam O
, O
said O
this O
about O
these O
people O
: O
`` O
Look O
, O
the O
Lord O
is O
coming O
with O
thousands O
and O
thousands O
of O
his O
holy O
angels O
to O
judge O
everyone O
. O

He O
will O
punish O
all O
those O
who O
are O
against O
him O
for O
all O
the O
evil O
they O
have O
done O
in O
their O
lack O
of O
respect O
for O
him O
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
Lord O
will O
punish O
all O
these O
sinners O
who O
do O
n't O
honor O
him O
. O

He O
will O
punish O
them O
for O
all O
the O
evil O
things O
they O
have O
said O
against O
him O
. O
'' O

These O
people O
always O
complain O
and O
find O
wrong O
in O
others O
. O

They O
always O
do O
the O
evil O
things O
they O
want O
to O
do O
. O

They O
boast O
about O
themselves O
. O

The O
only O
reason O
they O
say O
good O
things O
about O
others O
is O
to O
get O
what O
they O
want O
. O

Dear O
friends O
, O
remember O
what O
the O
apostles O
of O
our O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
said O
would O
happen O
. O

They O
told O
you O
, O
`` O
In O
the O
last O
times O
there O
will O
be O
people O
who O
laugh O
at O
God O
and O
do O
only O
what O
they O
want O
to O
do O
-- O
things O
that O
are O
against O
God O
. O
'' O

These O
are O
the O
people O
who O
divide O
you O
. O

They O
are O
not O
spiritual O
, O
because O
they O
do O
n't O
have O
the O
Spirit O
. O

But O
you O
, O
dear O
friends O
, O
use O
your O
most O
holy O
faith O
to O
build O
yourselves O
up O
even O
stronger O
. O

Pray O
with O
the O
help O
of O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
. O

Keep O
yourselves O
safe O
in O
God O
's O
love O
, O
as O
you O
wait O
for O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
in O
his O
mercy O
to O
give O
you O
eternal O
life O
. O

Help O
those O
who O
have O
doubts O
. O

Rescue O
those O
who O
are O
living O
in O
danger O
of O
hell O
's O
fire O
. O

There O
are O
others O
you O
should O
treat O
with O
mercy O
, O
but O
be O
very O
careful O
that O
their O
filthy O
lives O
do O
n't O
rub O
off O
on O
you O
. O

God O
is O
strong O
and O
can O
keep O
you O
from O
falling O
. O

He O
can O
bring O
you O
before O
his O
glory O
without O
any O
wrong O
in O
you O
and O
give O
you O
great O
joy O
. O

He O
is O
the O
only O
God O
, O
the O
one O
who O
saves O
us O
. O

To O
him O
be O
glory O
, O
greatness O
, O
power O
, O
and O
authority O
through O
Jesus O
Christ O
our O
Lord O
for O
all O
time O
past O
, O
now O
, O
and O
forever O
. O

Amen O
. O

Before O
God O
and O
Jesus O
Christ O
I O
give O
you O
a O
command O
. O

Christ O
Jesus O
is O
the O
one O
who O
will O
judge O
all O
people O
-- O
those O
who O
are O
living O
and O
those O
who O
have O
died O
. O

He O
is O
coming O
again O
to O
rule O
in O
his O
kingdom O
. O

So O
I O
give O
you O
this O
command O
: O
Tell O
everyone O
God O
's O
message O
. O

Be O
ready O
at O
all O
times O
to O
do O
whatever O
is O
needed O
. O

Tell O
people O
what O
they O
need O
to O
do O
, O
tell O
them O
when O
they O
are O
doing O
wrong O
, O
and O
encourage O
them O
. O

Do O
this O
with O
great O
patience O
and O
careful O
teaching O
. O

The O
time O
will O
come O
when O
people O
will O
not O
listen O
to O
the O
true O
teaching O
. O

But O
people O
will O
find O
more O
and O
more O
teachers O
who O
please O
them O
. O

They O
will O
find O
teachers O
who O
say O
what O
they O
want O
to O
hear O
. O

People O
will O
stop O
listening O
to O
the O
truth O
. O

They O
will O
begin O
to O
follow O
the O
teaching O
in O
false O
stories O
. O

But O
you O
should O
control O
yourself O
at O
all O
times O
. O

When O
troubles O
come O
, O
accept O
them O
. O

Do O
the O
work O
of O
telling O
the O
Good O
News O
. O

Do O
all O
the O
duties O
of O
a O
servant O
of O
God O
. O

My O
life O
is O
being O
given O
as O
an O
offering O
for O
God O
. O

The O
time O
has O
come O
for O
me O
to O
leave O
this O
life O
here O
. O

I O
have O
fought O
the O
good O
fight O
. O

I O
have O
finished O
the O
race O
. O

I O
have O
served O
the O
Lord O
faithfully O
. O

Now O
, O
a O
prize O
is O
waiting O
for O
me O
-- O
the O
crown O
that O
will O
show O
I O
am O
right O
with O
God O
. O

The O
Lord O
, O
the O
judge O
who O
judges O
rightly O
, O
will O
give O
it O
to O
me O
on O
that O
Day O
. O

Yes O
, O
he O
will O
give O
it O
to O
me O
and O
to O
everyone O
else O
who O
is O
eagerly O
looking O
forward O
to O
his O
coming O
. O

Do O
your O
best O
to O
come O
to O
me O
as O
soon O
as O
you O
can O
. O

Demas O
loved O
this O
world O
too O
much O
. O

That O
is O
why O
he O
left O
me O
. O

He O
went O
to O
Thessalonica O
. O

Crescens O
went O
to O
Galatia O
. O

And O
Titus O
went O
to O
Dalmatia O
. O

Luke O
is O
the O
only O
one O
still O
with O
me O
. O

Get O
Mark O
and O
bring O
him O
with O
you O
when O
you O
come O
. O

He O
can O
help O
me O
in O
my O
work O
here O
. O

I O
sent O
Tychicus O
to O
Ephesus O
. O

When O
I O
was O
in O
Troas O
, O
I O
left O
my O
coat O
there O
with O
Carpus O
. O

So O
when O
you O
come O
, O
bring O
it O
to O
me O
. O

Also O
, O
bring O
my O
books O
. O

The O
books O
written O
on O
parchment O
are O
the O
ones O
I O
need O
. O

Alexander O
the O
metalworker O
caused O
me O
so O
much O
harm O
. O

The O
Lord O
will O
punish O
him O
for O
what O
he O
did O
. O

He O
fought O
against O
everything O
we O
teach O
. O

You O
should O
be O
careful O
that O
he O
does O
n't O
hurt O
you O
too O
. O

The O
first O
time O
I O
defended O
myself O
, O
no O
one O
helped O
me O
. O

Everyone O
left O
me O
. O

I O
pray O
that O
God O
will O
forgive O
them O
. O

But O
the O
Lord O
stayed O
with O
me O
. O

The O
Lord O
gave O
me O
strength O
so O
that O
I O
could O
tell O
the O
Good O
News O
everywhere O
. O

He O
wanted O
all O
those O
who O
are O
not O
Jews O
to O
hear O
that O
Good O
News O
. O

So O
I O
was O
saved O
from O
the O
lion O
's O
mouth O
. O

The O
Lord O
will O
save O
me O
when O
anyone O
tries O
to O
hurt O
me O
. O

He O
will O
bring O
me O
safely O
to O
his O
heavenly O
kingdom O
. O

Glory O
forever O
and O
ever O
be O
the O
Lord's O
. O

Amen O
. O

Give O
my O
greetings O

Priscilla O
and O
Aquila O
and O
to O
the O
family O
of O
Onesiphorus O

Erastus O
stayed O
in O
Corinth O
. O

And O
I O
left O
Trophimus O
in O
Miletus O

because O
we O
belong O
to O
Christ O
Jesus O
. O

What O
you O
have O
heard O
me O
teach O
publicly O
you O
should O
teach O
to O
others O
. O

Share O
these O
teachings O
with O
people O
you O
can O
trust O
. O

Then O
they O
will O
be O
able O
to O
teach O
others O
these O
same O
things O
. O

As O
a O
good O
soldier O
of O
Christ O
Jesus O
, O
accept O
your O
share O
of O
the O
troubles O
we O
have O
. O

A O
soldier O
wants O
to O
please O
his O
commanding O
officer O
, O
so O
he O
does O
not O
spend O
any O
time O
on O
activities O
that O
are O
not O
a O
part O
of O
his O
duty O

Athletes O

a O

obey O
all O

The O
farmer O
who O

hard O
deserves O
the O
first O
part O

the O
harvest O

Think O
about O

I O
am O
saying O
. O

The O
Lord O
will O
help O
you O
understand O
it O
all O

Remember O

was O
raised O
from O
death O
. O

This O
is O
the O
Good O
News O
that O
I O
tell O
people O
. O

And O
because O
I O
tell O
that O
message O
, O
I O
am O
suffering O
. O

I O
am O
even O
bound O
with O
chains O
like O
someone O
who O
has O
really O
done O
wrong O
. O

But O
God O
's O
message O
is O
not O
bound O
. O

So O
I O
patiently O
accept O
all O
these O
troubles O
. O

I O
do O
this O
to O
help O
the O
people O
God O
has O
chosen O
so O
that O
they O
can O
have O
the O
salvation O
that O
is O
in O
Christ O
Jesus O
. O

With O
this O
salvation O
comes O
glory O
that O
never O
ends O
. O

Here O
is O
a O
true O
statement O
: O
If O
we O
died O
with O
him O
, O
we O
will O
also O
live O
with O
him O
. O

If O
we O
remain O
faithful O
even O
in O
suffering O
, O
we O
will O
also O
rule O
with O
him O
. O

If O
we O
refuse O
to O
say O
we O
know O
him O
, O
he O
will O
refuse O
to O
say O
he O
knows O
us O
. O

If O
we O
are O
not O
faithful O
, O
he O
will O
still O
be O
faithful O
, O
because O
he O
can O
not O
be O
false O
to O
himself O
. O

Keep O
on O
telling O
everyone O
these O
truths O
. O

And O
warn O
them O
before O
God O
not O
to O
argue O
about O
words O
. O

Such O
arguments O
do O
n't O
help O
anyone O
, O
and O
they O
ruin O
those O
who O
listen O
to O
them O
. O

Do O
your O
best O
to O
be O
the O
kind O
of O
person O
God O
will O
accept O
, O
and O
give O
yourself O
to O
him O
. O

Be O
a O
worker O
who O
has O
no O
reason O
to O
be O
ashamed O
of O
his O
work O
, O
one O
who O
applies O
the O
true O
teaching O
in O
the O
right O
way O
. O

Stay O
away O
from O
people O
who O
talk O
about O
useless O
things O
that O
are O
not O
from O
God O
. O

That O
kind O
of O
talk O
will O
lead O
a O
person O
more O
and O
more O
against O
God O
. O

Their O
evil O
teaching O
will O
spread O
like O
a O
sickness O
inside O
the O
body O
. O

Hymenaeus O
and O
Philetus O
are O
men O
like O
that O
. O

They O
have O
left O
the O
true O
teaching O
. O

They O
say O
that O
the O
day O
when O
people O
will O
be O
raised O
from O
death O
has O
already O
come O
and O
gone O
. O

And O
they O
are O
destroying O
the O
faith O
of O
some O
people O
. O

But O
God O
's O
strong O
foundation O
never O
moves O
, O
and O
these O
words O
are O
written O
on O
it O
: O
`` O
The O
Lord O
knows O
those O
who O
belong O
to O
him O
. O
'' O

Also O
, O
these O
words O
are O
written O
there O
: O
`` O
Everyone O
who O
says O
they O
believe O
in O
the O
Lord O
must O
stop O
doing O
wrong O
. O
'' O

In O
a O
large O
house O
there O
are O
things O
made O
of O
gold O
and O
silver O
. O

But O
there O
are O
also O
things O
made O
of O
wood O
and O
clay O
. O

Some O
of O
these O
are O
used O
for O
special O
purposes O
, O
others O
for O
ordinary O
jobs O
. O

The O
Lord O
wants O
to O
use O
you O
for O
special O
purposes O
, O
so O
make O
yourself O
clean O
from O
all O
evil O
. O

Then O
you O
will O
be O
holy O
, O
and O
the O
Master O
can O
use O
you O
. O

You O
will O
be O
ready O
for O
any O
good O
work O
. O

Stay O
away O
from O
the O
evil O
things O
a O
young O
person O
like O
you O
typically O
wants O
to O
do O
. O

Do O
your O
best O
to O
live O
right O
and O
to O
have O
faith O
, O
love O
, O
and O
peace O
, O
together O
with O
others O
who O
trust O
in O
the O
Lord O
with O
pure O
hearts O
. O

Stay O
away O
from O
foolish O
and O
stupid O
arguments O
. O

You O
know O
that O
these O
arguments O
grow O
into O
bigger O
arguments O
. O

As O
a O
servant O
of O
the O
Lord O
, O
you O
must O
not O
argue O
. O

You O
must O
be O
kind O
to O
everyone O
. O

You O
must O
be O
a O
good O
teacher O
, O
and O
you O
must O
be O
patient O
. O

You O
must O
gently O
teach O
those O
who O
do O
n't O
agree O
with O
you O
. O

Maybe O
God O
will O
let O
them O
change O
their O
hearts O
so O
that O
they O
can O
accept O
the O
truth O
. O

The O
devil O
has O
trapped O
them O
and O
now O
makes O
them O
do O
what O
he O
wants O
. O

But O
maybe O
they O
can O
wake O
up O
to O
see O
what O
is O
happening O
and O
free O
themselves O
from O
the O
devil O
's O
trap O
. O

Remember O
this O
: O
There O
are O
some O
terrible O
times O
coming O
in O
the O
last O
days O
. O

People O
will O
love O
only O
themselves O
and O
money O
. O

They O
will O
be O
proud O
and O
boast O
about O
themselves O
. O

They O
will O
abuse O
others O
with O
insults O
. O

They O
will O
not O
obey O
their O
parents O
. O

They O
will O
be O
ungrateful O
and O
against O
all O
that O
is O
pleasing O
to O
God O
. O

They O
will O
have O
no O
love O
for O
others O
and O
will O
refuse O
to O
forgive O
anyone O
. O

They O
will O
talk O
about O
others O
to O
hurt O
them O
and O
will O
have O
no O
self O
- O

control O
. O

They O
will O
be O
cruel O
and O
hate O
what O
is O
good O
. O

People O
will O
turn O
against O
their O
friends O
. O

They O
will O
do O
foolish O
things O
without O
thinking O
and O
will O
be O
so O
proud O
of O
themselves O
. O

Instead O
of O
loving O
God O
, O
they O
will O
love O
pleasure O
. O

They O
will O
go O
on O
pretending O
to O
be O
devoted O
to O
God O
, O
but O
they O
will O
refuse O
to O
let O
that O
`` O
devotion O
'' O
change O
the O
way O
they O
live O
. O

Stay O
away O
from O
these O
people O
! O

Some O
of O
them O
go O
into O
homes O
and O
get O
control O
over O
weak O
women O
, O
whose O
lives O
are O
full O
of O
sin O
-- O
women O
who O
are O
led O
into O
sin O
by O
all O
the O
things O
they O
want O
. O

These O
women O
always O
want O
to O
learn O
something O
new O
, O
but O
they O
are O
never O
able O
to O
fully O
understand O
the O
truth O
. O

Just O
as O
Jannes O
and O
Jambres O
fought O
against O
Moses O
, O
these O
people O
fight O
against O
the O
truth O
. O

Their O
thinking O
has O
been O
confused O
. O

The O
faith O
they O
have O
and O
teach O
is O
worthless O
. O

But O
they O
will O
not O
succeed O
in O
what O
they O
are O
trying O
to O
do O
. O

Everyone O
will O
see O
how O
foolish O
they O
are O
. O

That O
is O
what O
happened O
to O
Jannes O
and O
Jambres O
. O

But O
you O
know O
all O
about O
me O
. O

You O
know O
what O
I O
teach O
and O
the O
way O
I O
live O
. O

You O
know O
my O
goal O
in O
life O
. O

You O
know O
my O
faith O
, O
my O
patience O
, O
and O
my O
love O
. O

You O
know O
that O
I O
never O
stop O
trying O
. O

You O
know O
about O
my O
persecutions O
and O
my O
sufferings O
. O

You O
know O
all O
the O
things O
that O
happened O
to O
me O
in O
Antioch O
, O
Iconium O
, O
and O
Lystra O
-- O
the O
persecution O
I O
suffered O
in O
those O
places O
. O

But O
the O
Lord O
saved O
me O
from O
all O
of O
it O
. O

Everyone O
who O
wants O
to O
live O
showing O
true O
devotion O
to O
God O
in O
Christ O
Jesus O
will O
be O
persecuted O
. O

People O
who O
are O
evil O
and O
cheat O
others O
will O
become O
worse O
and O
worse O
. O

They O
will O
fool O
others O
, O
but O
they O
will O
also O
be O
fooling O
themselves O
. O

But O
you O
should O
continue O
following O
the O
teaching O
you O
learned O
. O

You O
know O
it O
is O
true O
, O
because O
you O
know O
you O
can O
trust O
those O
who O
taught O
you O
. O

You O
have O
known O
the O
Holy O
Scriptures O
since O
you O
were O
a O
child O
. O

These O
Scriptures O
are O
able O
to O
make O
you O
wise O
. O

And O
that O
wisdom O
leads O
to O
salvation O
through O
faith O
in O
Christ O
Jesus O
. O

All O
Scripture O
is O
given O
by O
God O
. O

And O
all O
Scripture O
is O
useful O
for O
teaching O
and O
for O
showing O
people O
what O
is O
wrong O
in O
their O
lives O
. O

It O
is O
useful O
for O
correcting O
faults O
and O
teaching O
the O
right O
way O
to O
live O
. O

Using O
the O
Scriptures O
, O
those O
who O
serve O
God O
will O
be O
prepared O
and O
will O
have O
everything O
they O
need O
to O
do O
every O
good O
work O
. O

Greetings O
from O
Paul O
, O
an O
apostle O
of O
Christ O
Jesus O
. O

I O
am O
an O
apostle O
because O
God O
wanted O
me O
to O
be O
. O

God O
sent O
me O
to O
tell O
people O
about O
the O
promise O
of O
life O
that O
is O
in O
Christ O
Jesus O
. O

To O
Timothy O
, O
a O
dear O
son O
to O
me O
. O

Grace O
, O
mercy O
, O
and O
peace O
to O
you O
from O
God O
the O
Father O
and O
from O
Christ O
Jesus O
our O
Lord O
. O

I O
always O
remember O
you O
in O
my O
prayers O
day O
and O
night O
. O

And O
in O
these O
prayers O
I O
thank O
God O
for O
you O
. O

He O
is O
the O
God O
my O
ancestors O
served O
, O
and O
I O
have O
always O
served O
him O
with O
a O
clear O
conscience O
. O

I O
remember O
that O
you O
cried O
for O
me O
. O

I O
want O
very O
much O
to O
see O
you O
so O
that O
I O
can O
be O
filled O
with O
joy O
. O

I O
remember O
your O
true O
faith O
. O

That O
kind O
of O
faith O
first O
belonged O
to O
your O
grandmother O
Lois O
and O
to O
your O
mother O
Eunice O
. O

I O
know O
you O
now O
have O
that O
same O
faith O
. O

That O
is O
why O
I O
want O
you O
to O
remember O
the O
gift O
God O
gave O
you O
. O

God O
gave O
you O
that O
gift O
when O
I O
laid O
my O
hands O
on O
you O
. O

Now O
I O
want O
you O
to O
use O
that O
gift O
and O
let O
it O
grow O
more O
and O
more O
, O
like O
a O
small O
flame O
grows O
into O
a O
fire O
. O

The O
Spirit O
God O
gave O
us O
does O
not O
make O
us O
afraid O
. O

His O
Spirit O
is O
a O
source O
of O
power O
and O
love O
and O
self O
- O
control O
. O

So O
do O
n't O
be O
ashamed O
to O
tell O
people O
about O
our O
Lord O
Jesus O
. O

And O
do O
n't O
be O
ashamed O
of O
me O
-- O
I O
am O
in O
prison O
for O
the O
Lord O
. O

But O
suffer O
with O
me O
for O
the O
Good O
News O
. O

God O
gives O
us O
the O
strength O
to O
do O
that O
. O

God O
saved O
us O
and O
chose O
us O
to O
be O
his O
holy O
people O
, O
but O
not O
because O
of O
anything O
we O
ourselves O
did O
. O

God O
saved O
us O
and O
made O
us O
his O
people O
because O
that O
was O
what O
he O
wanted O
and O
because O
of O
his O
grace O
. O

That O
grace O
was O
given O
to O
us O
through O
Christ O
Jesus O
before O
time O
began O
. O

And O
now O
it O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
us O
in O
the O
coming O
of O
our O
Savior O
Christ O
Jesus O
. O

He O
destroyed O
death O
and O
showed O
us O
the O
way O
to O
have O
life O
. O

Yes O
, O
through O
the O
Good O
News O
Jesus O
showed O
us O
the O
way O
to O
have O
life O
that O
can O
not O
be O
destroyed O
. O

I O
was O
chosen O
to O
tell O
people O
that O
message O
as O
an O
apostle O
and O
teacher O
. O

And O
I O
suffer O
now O
because O
of O
that O
work O
. O

But O
I O
am O
not O
ashamed O
. O

I O
know O
the O
one O
I O
have O
believed O
, O
and O
I O
am O
sure O
that O
he O
is O
able O
to O
protect O
what O
he O
has O
trusted O
me O
with O
until O
that O
Day O
. O

What O
you O
heard O
me O
teach O
is O
an O
example O
of O
what O
you O
should O
teach O
. O

Follow O
that O
model O
of O
right O
teaching O
with O
the O
faith O
and O
love O
we O
have O
in O
Christ O
Jesus O
. O

This O
teaching O
is O
a O
treasure O
that O
you O
have O
been O
trusted O
with O
. O

Protect O
it O
with O
the O
help O
of O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
, O
who O
lives O
inside O
us O
. O

You O
know O
that O
everyone O
in O
Asia O
has O
left O
me O
. O

Even O
Phygelus O
and O
Hermogenes O
have O
left O
me O
. O

I O
pray O
that O
the O
Lord O
will O
show O
mercy O
to O
the O
family O
of O
Onesiphorus O
. O

Many O
times O
Onesiphorus O
encouraged O
me O
. O

He O
was O
not O
ashamed O
that O
I O
was O
in O
prison O
. O

No O
, O
he O
was O
not O
ashamed O
. O

When O
he O
came O
to O
Rome O
, O
he O
looked O
and O
looked O
for O
me O
until O
he O
found O
me O
. O

I O
pray O
that O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
will O
make O
sure O
Onesiphorus O
receives O
mercy O
from O
the O
Lord O
God O
on O
that O
Day O
. O

You O
know O
how O
many O
ways O
this O
brother O
helped O
me O
in O
Ephesus O
. O

Greetings O
from O
the O
Elder O
. O

To O
the O
lady O
chosen O
by O
God O
and O
to O
her O
children O
. O

I O
truly O
love O
all O
of O
you O
. O

And O
I O
am O
not O
the O
only O
one O
. O

All O
those O
who O
know O
the O
truth O
love O
you O
in O
the O
same O
way O
. O

We O
love O
you O
because O
of O
the O
truth O
-- O
the O
truth O
that O
lives O
in O
us O
. O

That O
truth O
will O
be O
with O
us O
forever O
. O

Grace O
, O
mercy O
, O
and O
peace O
will O
be O
with O
us O
from O
God O
the O
Father O
and O
from O
his O
Son O
, O
Jesus O
Christ O
, O
as O
we O
live O
in O
truth O
and O
love O
. O

I O
was O
very O
happy O
to O
learn O
about O
some O
of O
your O
children O
. O

I O
am O
happy O
that O
they O
are O
following O
the O
way O
of O
truth O
, O
just O
as O
the O
Father O
commanded O
us O
. O

And O
now O
, O
dear O
lady O
, O
I O
tell O
you O
: O
We O
should O
all O
love O
each O
other O
. O

This O
is O
not O
a O
new O
command O
. O

It O
is O
the O
same O
command O
we O
had O
from O
the O
beginning O
. O

And O
loving O
means O
living O
the O
way O
he O
commanded O
us O
to O
live O
. O

And O
God O
's O
command O
is O
this O
: O
that O
you O
live O
a O
life O
of O
love O
. O

You O
heard O
this O
command O
from O
the O
beginning O
. O

Many O
false O
teachers O
are O
in O
the O
world O
now O
. O

They O
refuse O
to O
say O
that O
Jesus O
Christ O
came O
to O
earth O
and O
became O
a O
man O
. O

Anyone O
who O
refuses O
to O
accept O
this O
fact O
is O
a O
false O
teacher O
and O
the O
enemy O
of O
Christ O
. O

Be O
careful O
! O

Do O
n't O
lose O
the O
reward O
you O
have O
worked O
for O
. O

Be O
careful O
so O
that O
you O
will O
receive O
all O
of O
your O
reward O
. O

Everyone O
must O
continue O
to O
follow O
only O
the O
teaching O
about O
Christ O
. O

Whoever O
changes O
that O
teaching O
does O
not O
have O
God O
. O

But O
whoever O
continues O
to O
follow O
the O
teaching O
about O
Christ O
has O
both O
the O
Father O
and O
his O
Son O

Do O
n't O
accept O
those O
who O
come O
to O
you O
but O
do O
not O
bring O
this O
teaching O
. O

Do O
n't O
invite O
them O
into O
your O
house O
. O

Do O
n't O
welcome O
them O
in O
any O
way O
. O

If O
you O
do O
, O
you O
are O
helping O
them O
with O
their O
evil O
work O
. O

I O
have O
much O
to O
say O
to O
you O
. O

But O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
use O
paper O
and O
ink O
. O

Instead O
, O
I O
hope O
to O
come O
visit O
you O
. O

Then O
we O
can O
be O
together O
and O
talk O
. O

That O
will O
make O
us O
very O
happy O
. O

The O
children O
of O
your O
sister O
who O
was O
chosen O
by O
God O
send O
you O
their O
love O
. O

Before O
the O
world O
began O
, O
the O
Word O
was O
there O
. O

The O
Word O
was O
with O
God O
, O
and O
the O
Word O
was O
God O
. O

He O
was O
there O
with O
God O
in O
the O
beginning O
. O

Everything O
was O
made O
through O
him O
, O
and O
nothing O
was O
made O
without O
him O
. O

In O
him O
there O
was O
life O
, O
and O
that O
life O
was O
a O
light O
for O
the O
people O
of O
the O
world O
. O

The O
light O
shines O
in O
the O
darkness O
, O
and O
the O
darkness O
has O
not O
defeated O
it O
. O

There O
was O
a O
man O
named O
John O
, O
who O
was O
sent O
by O
God O
. O

He O
came O
to O
tell O
people O
about O
the O
light O
. O

Through O
him O
all O
people O
could O
hear O
about O
the O
light O
and O
believe O
. O

John O
was O
not O
the O
light O
. O

But O
he O
came O
to O
tell O
people O
about O
the O
light O
. O

The O
true O
light O
was O
coming O
into O
the O
world O
. O

This O
is O
the O
true O
light O
that O
gives O
light O
to O
all O
people O
. O

The O
Word O
was O
already O
in O
the O
world O
. O

The O
world O
was O
made O
through O
him O
, O
but O
the O
world O
did O
not O
know O
him O
. O

He O
came O
to O
the O
world O
that O
was O
his O
own O
. O

And O
his O
own O
people O
did O
not O
accept O
him O
. O

But O
some O
people O
did O
accept O
him O
. O

They O
believed O
in O
him O
, O
and O
he O
gave O
them O
the O
right O
to O
become O
children O
of O
God O
. O

They O
became O
God O
's O
children O
, O
but O
not O
in O
the O
way O
babies O
are O
usually O
born O
. O

It O
was O
not O
because O
of O
any O
human O
desire O
or O
plan O
. O

They O
were O
born O
from O
God O
himself O
. O

The O
Word O
became O
a O
man O
and O
lived O
among O
us O
. O

We O
saw O
his O
divine O
greatness O
-- O
the O
greatness O
that O
belongs O
to O
the O
only O
Son O
of O
the O
Father O
. O

The O
Word O
was O
full O
of O
grace O
and O
truth O
. O

John O
told O
people O
about O
him O
. O

He O
said O
loudly O
, O
`` O
This O
is O
the O
one O
I O
was O
talking O
about O
when O
I O
said O
, O
' O
The O
one O
who O
is O
coming O
after O
me O
is O
greater O
than O
I O
am O
, O
because O
he O
was O
living O
before O
I O
was O
even O
born O
. O
' O
'' O

Yes O
, O
the O
Word O
was O
full O
of O
grace O
and O
truth O
, O
and O
from O
him O
we O
all O
received O
one O
blessing O
after O
another O
. O

That O
is O
, O
the O
law O
was O
given O
to O
us O
through O
Moses O
, O
but O
grace O
and O
truth O
came O
through O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

No O
one O
has O
ever O
seen O
God O
. O

The O
only O
Son O
is O
the O
one O
who O
has O
shown O
us O
what O
God O
is O
like O
. O

He O
is O
himself O
God O
and O
is O
very O
close O
to O
the O
Father O
. O

The O
Jewish O
leaders O
in O
Jerusalem O
sent O
some O
priests O
and O
Levites O
to O
John O
to O
ask O
him O
, O
`` O
Who O
are O
you O
? O
'' O

He O
told O
them O
the O
truth O
. O

Without O
any O
hesitation O
he O
said O
openly O
and O
plainly O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
not O
the O
Christ O
. O
'' O

They O
asked O
him O
, O
`` O
Then O
who O
are O
you O
? O

Are O
you O
Elijah O
? O
'' O

He O
answered O
, O
`` O
No O
, O
I O
am O
not O
Elijah O
. O
'' O

They O
asked O
, O
`` O
Are O
you O
the O
Prophet O
? O
'' O

He O
answered O
, O
`` O
No O
, O
I O
am O
not O
the O
Prophet O
. O
'' O

Then O
they O
said O
, O
`` O
Who O
are O
you O
? O

Tell O
us O
about O
yourself O
. O

Give O
us O
an O
answer O
to O
tell O
the O
people O
who O
sent O
us O
. O

What O
do O
you O
say O
about O
yourself O
? O
'' O

John O
told O
them O
the O
words O
of O
the O
prophet O
Isaiah O
: O
`` O
I O
am O
the O
voice O
of O
someone O
shouting O
in O
the O
desert O
: O
' O
Make O
a O
straight O
road O
ready O
for O
the O
Lord O
. O
' O
'' O

These O
Jews O
were O
sent O
from O
the O
Pharisees O
. O

They O
said O
to O
John O
, O
`` O
You O
say O
you O
are O
not O
the O
Christ O
. O

You O
say O
you O
are O
not O
Elijah O
or O
the O
Prophet O
. O

Then O
why O
do O
you O
baptize O
people O
? O
'' O

John O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
baptize O
people O
with O
water O
. O

But O
there O
is O
someone O
here O
with O
you O
that O
you O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

He O
is O
the O
one O
who O
is O
coming O
later O
. O

I O
am O
not O
good O
enough O
to O
be O
the O
slave O
who O
unties O
the O
strings O
on O
his O
sandals O
. O
'' O

These O
things O
all O
happened O
at O
Bethany O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
Jordan O
River O
. O

This O
is O
where O
John O
was O
baptizing O
people O
. O

The O
next O
day O
John O
saw O
Jesus O
coming O
toward O
him O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Look O
, O
the O
Lamb O
of O
God O
. O

He O
takes O
away O
the O
sins O
of O
the O
world O
! O

This O
is O
the O
one O
I O
was O
talking O
about O
when O
I O
said O
, O
' O
There O
is O
a O
man O
coming O
after O
me O
who O
is O
greater O
than O
I O
am O
, O
because O
he O
was O
living O
even O
before O
I O
was O
born O
. O
' O

I O
did O
not O
know O
who O
he O
was O
. O

But O
I O
came O
baptizing O
people O
with O
water O
so O
that O
Israel O
could O
know O
that O
Jesus O
is O
the O
Christ O
. O
'' O

Then O
John O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
also O
did O
not O
know O
who O
the O
Christ O
was O
. O

But O
the O
one O
who O
sent O
me O
to O
baptize O
with O
water O
told O
me O
, O
' O
You O
will O
see O
the O
Spirit O
come O
down O
and O
rest O
on O
a O
man O
. O

He O
is O
the O
one O
who O
will O
baptize O
with O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
. O
' O

I O
have O
seen O
this O
happen O
. O

I O
saw O
the O
Spirit O
come O
down O
from O
heaven O
like O
a O
dove O
and O
rest O
on O
this O
man O
. O

So O
this O
is O
what O
I O
tell O
people O
: O
' O
He O
is O
the O
Son O
of O
God O
. O
' O
'' O

The O
next O
day O
John O
was O
there O
again O
and O
had O
two O
of O
his O
followers O
with O
him O
. O

He O
saw O
Jesus O
walking O
by O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Look O
, O
the O
Lamb O
of O
God O
! O
'' O

The O
two O
followers O
heard O
him O
say O
this O
, O
so O
they O
followed O
Jesus O
. O

Jesus O
turned O
and O
saw O
the O
two O
men O
following O
him O
. O

He O
asked O
, O
`` O
What O
do O
you O
want O
? O
'' O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Rabbi O
, O
where O
are O
you O
staying O
? O
'' O

-LRB- O
`` O
Rabbi O
'' O
means O
`` O
Teacher O
. O
'' O
-RRB- O

He O
answered O
, O
`` O
Come O
with O
me O
and O
you O
will O
see O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
two O
men O
went O
with O
him O
. O

They O
saw O
the O
place O
where O
he O
was O
staying O
, O
and O
they O
stayed O
there O
with O
him O
that O
day O
. O

It O
was O
about O
four O
o'clock O
. O

These O
men O
followed O
Jesus O
after O
they O
had O
heard O
about O
him O
from O
John O
. O

One O
of O
them O
was O
Andrew O
, O
the O
brother O
of O
Simon O
Peter O
. O

The O
first O
thing O
Andrew O
did O
was O
to O
go O
and O
find O
his O
brother O
Simon O
. O

Andrew O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
We O
have O
found O
the O
Messiah O
. O
'' O

-LRB- O
`` O
Messiah O
'' O
means O
`` O
Christ O
. O
'' O

-RRB- O
Then O
Andrew O
brought O
Simon O
to O
Jesus O
. O

Jesus O
looked O
at O
him O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
are O
Simon O
, O
the O
son O
of O
John O
. O

You O
will O
be O
called O
Cephas O
. O
'' O

-LRB- O
`` O
Cephas O
'' O
means O
`` O
Peter O
. O
'' O

-RRB- O
The O
next O
day O
Jesus O
decided O
to O
go O
to O
Galilee O
. O

He O
met O
Philip O
and O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Follow O
me O
. O
'' O

Philip O
was O
from O
the O
town O
of O
Bethsaida O
, O
the O
same O
as O
Andrew O
and O
Peter O
. O

Philip O
found O
Nathanael O
and O
told O
him O
, O
`` O
We O
have O
found O
the O
man O
that O
Moses O
wrote O
about O
in O
the O
law O
. O

The O
prophets O
wrote O
about O
him O
too O
. O

He O
is O
Jesus O
, O
the O
son O
of O
Joseph O
. O

He O
is O
from O
Nazareth O
. O
'' O

But O
Nathanael O
said O
to O
Philip O
, O
`` O
Nazareth O
! O

Can O
anything O
good O
come O
from O
Nazareth O
? O
'' O

Philip O
answered O
, O
`` O
Come O
and O
see O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
saw O
Nathanael O
coming O
toward O
him O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
This O
man O
coming O
is O
a O
true O
Israelite O
, O
one O
you O
can O
trust O
. O
'' O

Nathanael O
asked O
, O
`` O
How O
do O
you O
know O
me O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
saw O
you O
when O
you O
were O
under O
the O
fig O
tree O
, O
before O
Philip O
told O
you O
about O
me O
. O
'' O

Then O
Nathanael O
said O
, O
`` O
Teacher O
, O
you O
are O
the O
Son O
of O
God O
. O

You O
are O
the O
King O
of O
Israel O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Do O
you O
believe O
this O
just O
because O
I O
said O
I O
saw O
you O
under O
the O
fig O
tree O
? O

You O
will O
see O
much O
greater O
things O
than O
that O
! O
'' O

Then O
he O
said O
, O
`` O
Believe O
me O
when O
I O
say O
that O
you O
will O
all O
see O
heaven O
open O
. O

You O
will O
see O
' O
angels O
of O
God O
going O
up O
and O
coming O
down O
' O
on O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O
. O
'' O

It O
was O
almost O
time O
for O
the O
Jewish O
Passover O
festival O
. O

Jesus O
knew O
that O
the O
time O
had O
come O
for O
him O
to O
leave O
this O
world O
and O
go O
back O
to O
the O
Father O
. O

Jesus O
had O
always O
loved O
the O
people O
in O
the O
world O
who O
were O
his O
. O

Now O
was O
the O
time O
he O
showed O
them O
his O
love O
the O
most O
. O

Jesus O
and O
his O
followers O
were O
at O
the O
evening O
meal O
. O

The O
devil O
had O
already O
persuaded O
Judas O
Iscariot O
to O
hand O
Jesus O
over O
to O
his O
enemies O
. O

-LRB- O
Judas O
was O
the O
son O
of O
Simon O
. O
-RRB- O

The O
Father O
had O
given O
Jesus O
power O
over O
everything O
. O

Jesus O
knew O
this O
. O

He O
also O
knew O
that O
he O
had O
come O
from O
God O
. O

And O
he O
knew O
that O
he O
was O
going O
back O
to O
God O
. O

So O
while O
they O
were O
eating O
, O
Jesus O
stood O
up O
and O
took O
off O
his O
robe O
. O

He O
got O
a O
towel O
and O
wrapped O
it O
around O
his O
waist O
. O

Then O
he O
poured O
water O
into O
a O
bowl O
and O
began O
to O
wash O
the O
followers O
' O
feet O
. O

He O
dried O
their O
feet O
with O
the O
towel O
that O
was O
wrapped O
around O
his O
waist O
. O

He O
came O
to O
Simon O
Peter O
. O

But O
Peter O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
you O
should O
not O
wash O
my O
feet O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
You O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
I O
am O
doing O
now O
. O

But O
later O
you O
will O
understand O
. O
'' O

Peter O
said O
, O
`` O
No O
! O

You O
will O
never O
wash O
my O
feet O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
If O
I O
do O
n't O
wash O
your O
feet O
, O
you O
are O
not O
one O
of O
my O
people O
. O
'' O

Simon O
Peter O
said O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
after O
you O
wash O
my O
feet O
, O
wash O
my O
hands O
and O
my O
head O
too O
! O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
After O
a O
person O
has O
a O
bath O
, O
his O
whole O
body O
is O
clean O
. O

He O
needs O
only O
to O
wash O
his O
feet O
. O

And O
you O
are O
clean O
, O
but O
not O
all O
of O
you O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
knew O
who O
would O
hand O
him O
over O
to O
his O
enemies O
. O

That O
is O
why O
he O
said O
, O
`` O
Not O
all O
of O
you O
are O
clean O
. O
'' O

When O
Jesus O
finished O
washing O
their O
feet O
, O
he O
put O
on O
his O
clothes O
and O
went O
back O
to O
the O
table O
. O

He O
asked O
, O
`` O
Do O
you O
understand O
what O
I O
did O
for O
you O
? O

You O
call O
me O
' O
Teacher O
. O
' O

And O
you O
call O
me O
' O
Lord O
. O
' O

And O
this O
is O
right O
, O
because O
that O
is O
what O
I O
am O
. O

I O
am O
your O
Lord O
and O
Teacher O
. O

But O
I O
washed O
your O
feet O
. O

So O
you O
also O
should O
wash O
each O
other O
's O
feet O
. O

I O
did O
this O
as O
an O
example O
for O
you O
. O

So O
you O
should O
serve O
each O
other O
just O
as O
I O
served O
you O
. O

Believe O
me O
, O
servants O
are O
not O
greater O
than O
their O
master O
. O

Those O
who O
are O
sent O
to O
do O
something O
are O
not O
greater O
than O
the O
one O
who O
sent O
them O
. O

If O
you O
know O
these O
things O
, O
great O
blessings O
will O
be O
yours O
if O
you O
do O
them O
. O

`` O
I O
am O
not O
talking O
about O
all O
of O
you O

I O
know O
the O
people O
I O
have O
chosen O

But O
what O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
must O
happen O
: O
' O
The O
man O
who O
shared O
my O
food O
has O
turned O
against O
me O
. O
' O

I O
am O
telling O
you O
this O
now O
before O
it O
happens O

Then O
when O
it O
happens O
, O
you O
will O
believe O

I O
AM O
. O

I O
assure O
you O
, O
whoever O
accepts O
the O
person O
I O
send O
also O
accepts O
me O
. O

And O
whoever O
accepts O
me O
also O
accepts O
the O
one O
who O
sent O
me O
. O
'' O

After O
Jesus O
said O
these O
things O
, O
he O
felt O
very O
troubled O
. O

He O
said O
openly O
, O
`` O
Believe O
me O
when O
I O
say O
that O
one O
of O
you O
will O
hand O
me O
over O
to O
my O
enemies O
. O
'' O

His O
followers O
all O
looked O
at O
each O
other O
. O

They O
did O
not O
understand O
who O
Jesus O
was O
talking O
about O
. O

One O
of O
the O
followers O
was O
next O
to O
Jesus O
and O
was O
leaning O
close O
to O
him O
. O

This O
was O
the O
one O
Jesus O
loved O
very O
much O
. O

Simon O
Peter O
made O
signs O
to O
this O
follower O
to O
ask O
Jesus O
who O
he O
was O
talking O
about O
. O

That O
follower O
leaned O
closer O
to O
Jesus O
and O
asked O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
who O
is O
it O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
him O
, O
`` O
I O
will O
dip O
this O
bread O
into O
the O
dish O
. O

The O
man O
I O
give O
it O
to O
is O
the O
one O
. O
'' O

So O
Jesus O
took O
a O
piece O
of O
bread O
, O
dipped O
it O
, O
and O
gave O
it O
to O
Judas O
Iscariot O
, O
the O
son O
of O
Simon O
. O

When O
Judas O
took O
the O
bread O
, O
Satan O
entered O
him O
. O

Jesus O
said O
to O
Judas O
, O
`` O
What O
you O
will O
do O
-- O
do O
it O
quickly O
! O
'' O

No O
one O
at O
the O
table O
understood O
why O
Jesus O
said O
this O
to O
Judas O
. O

Since O
Judas O
was O
the O
one O
in O
charge O
of O
the O
money O
, O
some O
of O
them O
thought O
that O
Jesus O
meant O
for O
him O
to O
go O
and O
buy O
some O
things O
they O
needed O
for O
the O
feast O
. O

Or O
they O
thought O
that O
Jesus O
wanted O
him O
to O
go O
give O
something O
to O
the O
poor O
. O

Judas O
ate O
the O
bread O
Jesus O
gave O
him O
. O

Then O
he O
immediately O
went O
out O
. O

It O
was O
night O
. O

When O
Judas O
was O
gone O
, O
Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Now O
is O
the O
time O
for O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O
to O
receive O
his O
glory O
. O

And O
God O
will O
receive O
glory O
through O
him O
. O

If O
God O
receives O
glory O
through O
him O
, O
he O
will O
give O
glory O
to O
the O
Son O
through O
himself O
. O

And O
that O
will O
happen O
very O
soon O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
My O
children O
, O
I O
will O
be O
with O
you O
only O
a O
short O
time O
more O
. O

You O
will O
look O
for O
me O
, O
but O
I O
tell O
you O
now O
what O
I O
told O
the O
Jewish O
leaders O
: O
Where O
I O
am O
going O
you O
can O
not O
come O
. O

`` O
I O
give O
you O
a O
new O
command O
: O
Love O
each O
other O
. O

You O
must O
love O
each O
other O
just O
as O
I O
loved O
you O
. O

All O
people O
will O
know O
that O
you O
are O
my O
followers O
if O
you O
love O
each O
other O
. O
'' O

Simon O
Peter O
asked O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
where O
are O
you O
going O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
Where O
I O
am O
going O
you O
can O
not O
follow O
now O
. O

But O
you O
will O
follow O
later O
. O
'' O

Peter O
asked O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
why O
ca O
n't O
I O
follow O
you O
now O
? O

I O
am O
ready O
to O
die O
for O
you O
! O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
Will O
you O
really O
give O
your O
life O
for O
me O
? O

The O
truth O
is O
, O
before O
the O
rooster O
crows O
, O
you O
will O
say O
three O
times O
that O
you O
do O
n't O
know O
me O
. O
'' O

After O
this O
, O
Jesus O
traveled O
around O
the O
country O
of O
Galilee O
. O

He O
did O
not O
want O
to O
travel O
in O
Judea O
, O
because O
the O
Jewish O
leaders O
there O
wanted O
to O
kill O
him O
. O

It O
was O
time O
for O
the O
Jewish O
Festival O
of O
Shelters O
. O

So O
his O
brothers O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
You O
should O
leave O
here O
and O
go O
to O
the O
festival O
in O
Judea O
. O

Then O
your O
followers O
there O
can O
see O
the O
miracles O
you O
do O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
be O
well O
known O
, O
you O
must O
not O
hide O
what O
you O
do O
. O

So O
, O
if O
you O
can O
do O
such O
amazing O
things O
, O
let O
the O
whole O
world O
see O
you O
do O
them O
. O

Let O
them O
see O
these O
things O
you O
do O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
' O
brothers O
said O
this O
because O
even O
they O
did O
not O
believe O
in O
him O
. O

Jesus O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
The O
right O
time O
for O
me O
has O
not O
yet O
come O
, O
but O
any O
time O
is O
right O
for O
you O
to O
go O
. O

The O
world O
can O
not O
hate O
you O
. O

But O
the O
world O
hates O
me O
, O
because O
I O
tell O
the O
people O
in O
the O
world O
that O
they O
do O
evil O
things O
. O

So O
you O
go O
to O
the O
festival O
. O

I O
will O
not O
go O
now O
, O
because O
the O
right O
time O
for O
me O
has O
not O
yet O
come O
. O
'' O

After O
Jesus O
said O
this O
, O
he O
stayed O
in O
Galilee O
. O

So O
his O
brothers O
left O
to O
go O
to O
the O
festival O
. O

After O
they O
left O
, O
Jesus O
went O
too O
, O
but O
he O
did O
not O
let O
people O
see O
him O
. O

At O
the O
festival O
the O
Jewish O
leaders O
were O
looking O
for O
him O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Where O
is O
that O
man O
? O
'' O

There O
was O
a O
large O
group O
of O
people O
there O
. O

Many O
of O
them O
were O
talking O
secretly O
to O
each O
other O
about O
Jesus O
. O

Some O
people O
said O
, O
`` O
He O
is O
a O
good O
man O
. O
'' O

But O
others O
said O
, O
`` O
No O
, O
he O
fools O
the O
people O
. O
'' O

But O
no O
one O
was O
brave O
enough O
to O
talk O
about O
him O
openly O
. O

They O
were O
afraid O
of O
the O
Jewish O
leaders O
. O

When O
the O
festival O
was O
about O
half O
finished O
, O
Jesus O
went O
to O
the O
Temple O
area O
and O
began O
to O
teach O
. O

The O
Jewish O
leaders O
were O
amazed O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
How O
did O
this O
man O
learn O
so O
much O
? O

He O
never O
had O
the O
kind O
of O
teaching O
we O
had O
! O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
What O
I O
teach O
is O
not O
my O
own O
. O

My O
teaching O
comes O
from O
the O
one O
who O
sent O
me O
. O

People O
who O
really O
want O
to O
do O
what O
God O
wants O
will O
know O
that O
my O
teaching O
comes O
from O
God O
. O

They O
will O
know O
that O
this O
teaching O
is O
not O
my O
own O
. O

If O
I O
taught O
my O
own O
ideas O
, O
I O
would O
just O
be O
trying O
to O
get O
honor O
for O
myself O
. O

But O
if O
I O
am O
trying O
to O
bring O
honor O
to O
the O
one O
who O
sent O
me O
, O
I O
can O
be O
trusted O
. O

Anyone O
doing O
that O
is O
not O
going O
to O
lie O
. O

Moses O
gave O
you O
the O
law O
, O
right O
? O

But O
you O
do O
n't O
obey O
that O
law O
. O

If O
you O
do O
, O
then O
why O
are O
you O
trying O
to O
kill O
me O
? O
'' O

The O
people O
answered O
, O
`` O
A O
demon O
is O
making O
you O
crazy O
! O

We O
are O
not O
trying O
to O
kill O
you O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
I O
did O
one O
miracle O
on O
a O
Sabbath O
day O
, O
and O
you O
were O
all O
surprised O
. O

But O
you O
obey O
the O
law O
Moses O
gave O
you O
about O
circumcision O
-- O
and O
sometimes O
you O
do O
it O
on O
a O
Sabbath O
day O
. O

-LRB- O
Really O
, O
Moses O
is O
not O
the O
one O
who O
gave O
you O
circumcision O
. O

It O
came O
from O
our O
ancestors O
who O
lived O
before O
Moses O
. O
-RRB- O

Yes O
, O
you O
often O
circumcise O
baby O
boys O
on O
a O
Sabbath O
day O
. O

This O
shows O
that O
someone O
can O
be O
circumcised O
on O
a O
Sabbath O
day O
to O
obey O
the O
Law O
of O
Moses O
. O

So O
why O
are O
you O
angry O
with O
me O
for O
healing O
a O
person O
's O
whole O
body O
on O
the O
Sabbath O
day O
? O

Stop O
judging O
by O
the O
way O
things O
look O
. O

Be O
fair O
and O
judge O
by O
what O
is O
really O
right O
. O
'' O

Then O
some O
of O
the O
people O
who O
lived O
in O
Jerusalem O
said O
, O
`` O
This O
is O
the O
man O
they O
are O
trying O
to O
kill O
. O

But O
he O
is O
teaching O
where O
everyone O
can O
see O
and O
hear O
him O
. O

And O
no O
one O
is O
trying O
to O
stop O
him O
from O
teaching O
. O

Maybe O
the O
leaders O
have O
decided O
that O
he O
really O
is O
the O
Christ O
. O

But O
when O
the O
real O
Christ O
comes O
, O
no O
one O
will O
know O
where O
he O
comes O
from O
. O

And O
we O
know O
where O
this O
man O
's O
home O
is O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
was O
still O
teaching O
in O
the O
Temple O
area O
when O
he O
said O
loudly O
, O
`` O
Do O
you O
really O
know O
me O
and O
where O
I O
am O
from O
? O

I O
am O
here O
, O
but O
not O
by O
my O
own O
decision O
. O

I O
was O
sent O
by O
one O
who O
is O
very O
real O
. O

But O
you O
do O
n't O
know O
him O
. O

I O
know O
him O
because O
I O
am O
from O
him O

He O
is O
the O
one O
who O
sent O
me O
. O
'' O

When O
Jesus O
said O
this O
, O
the O
people O
tried O
to O
grab O
him O
. O

But O
no O
one O
was O
able O
even O
to O
touch O
him O
, O
because O
the O
right O
time O
for O
him O
had O
not O
yet O
come O

But O
many O
of O
the O
people O
believed O
in O
Jesus O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
We O
are O
waiting O
for O
the O
Christ O
to O
come O

When O
he O
comes O
, O
will O
he O
do O
more O
miraculous O
signs O
than O
this O
man O
has O
done O
? O
'' O

The O
Pharisees O
heard O
what O
the O
people O
were O
saying O
about O
Jesus O
. O

So O
the O
leading O
priests O
and O
the O
Pharisees O
sent O
some O
Temple O
police O
to O
arrest O
him O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
will O
be O
with O
you O
a O
little O
while O
longer O

Then O
I O
will O
go O
back O
to O
the O
one O
who O
sent O
me O

You O
will O
look O
for O
me O

you O
will O
not O
find O
me O

And O
you O
can O
not O
come O
where O
I O

These O
Jews O
said O
to O
each O
other O
, O
`` O
Where O
will O
this O
man O
go O
that O
we O
can O
not O

the O
Greek O
cities O

our O
people O

Will O
he O
teach O
the O

He O

me O

He O
also O
says O
, O
' O
You O
can O
not O

I O

What O
does O
this O
mean O
? O
'' O

The O
last O
day O
of O
the O
festival O
came O
. O

It O
was O
the O
most O
important O
day O
. O

On O
that O
day O
Jesus O
stood O
up O
and O
said O
loudly O
, O
`` O
Whoever O
is O
thirsty O
may O
come O
to O
me O
and O
drink O
. O

If O
anyone O
believes O
in O
me O
, O
rivers O
of O
living O
water O
will O
flow O
out O
from O
their O
heart O
. O

That O
is O
what O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
was O
talking O
about O
the O
Spirit O
. O

The O
Spirit O
had O
not O
yet O
been O
given O
to O
people O
, O
because O
Jesus O
had O
not O
yet O
been O
raised O
to O
glory O
. O

But O
later O
, O
those O
who O
believed O
in O
Jesus O
would O
receive O
the O
Spirit O
. O

When O
the O
people O
heard O
the O
things O
that O
Jesus O
said O
, O
some O
of O
them O
said O
, O
`` O
This O
man O
really O
is O
the O
Prophet O

Other O
people O
said O
, O
`` O
He O

Christ O

And O
others O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
Christ O
will O
not O
come O
from O
Galilee O

The O
Scriptures O
say O
that O
he O
will O
come O
from O
the O
family O
of O
David O

And O
they O
say O
that O
he O
will O
come O
from O
Bethlehem O
, O
the O
town O
where O
David O
lived O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
people O
did O
not O
agree O
with O
each O
other O
about O
Jesus O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
people O
wanted O
to O
arrest O
him O
. O

But O
no O
one O
tried O
to O
do O
it O

The O
Temple O
police O
went O
back O
to O
the O
leading O
priests O
and O
the O
Pharisees O
. O

The O
priests O
and O
the O
Pharisees O
asked O
, O
`` O
Why O
did O
n't O
you O
bring O
Jesus O

'' O

The O
Temple O
police O
answered O
, O
`` O
We O
have O
never O
heard O
anyone O
say O
such O
amazing O
things O

The O
Pharisees O
answered O

`` O
So O
he O
has O
fooled O

You O
do O

any O
of O
us O

believing O

do O
you O

But O
those O
people O
out O
there O
know O
nothing O
about O
the O
law O

They O
are O
under O
God O
's O
curse O
! O
'' O

But O
Nicodemus O
was O
there O
in O
that O
group O
. O

He O
was O
the O
one O
who O
had O
gone O
to O
see O
Jesus O
before O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Our O
law O
will O
not O

us O
judge O
anyone O

first O
hearing O
them O
and O
finding O

The O
Jewish O
leaders O
answered O
, O
`` O
You O
must O
be O
from O

Study O
the O
Scriptures O

You O
will O
find O
nothing O

Then O
they O
all O
left O
and O
went O
home O

Later O
, O
Jesus O
went O
across O
Lake O
Galilee O
-LRB- O
also O
known O
as O
Lake O
Tiberias O
-RRB- O
. O

A O
great O
crowd O
of O
people O
followed O
him O
because O
they O
saw O
the O
miraculous O
signs O
he O
did O
in O
healing O
the O
sick O
. O

Jesus O
went O
up O
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
hill O
and O
sat O
there O
with O
his O
followers O
. O

It O
was O
almost O
the O
time O
for O
the O
Jewish O
Passover O
festival O
. O

Jesus O
looked O
up O
and O
saw O
a O
crowd O
of O
people O
coming O
toward O
him O

He O
said O
to O
Philip O
, O
`` O
Where O
can O
we O
buy O
enough O
bread O
for O
all O
these O
people O
to O
eat O
? O
'' O

He O
asked O
Philip O
this O
question O
to O
test O
him O
. O

Jesus O
already O
knew O
what O
he O
planned O
to O
do O
. O

Philip O
answered O
, O
`` O
We O
would O
all O
have O
to O
work O
a O
month O
to O
buy O
enough O
bread O
for O
each O
person O
here O
to O
have O
only O
a O
little O
piece O
! O
'' O

Another O
follower O
there O
was O
Andrew O
, O
the O
brother O
of O
Simon O
Peter O
. O

Andrew O
said O
, O
`` O
Here O
is O
a O
boy O
with O
five O
loaves O
of O
barley O
bread O
and O
two O
little O
fish O
. O

But O
that O
is O
not O
enough O
for O
so O
many O
people O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Tell O
everyone O
to O
sit O
down O
. O
'' O

This O
was O
a O
place O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
grass O
, O
and O
about O
5000 O
men O
sat O
down O
there O
. O

Jesus O
took O
the O
loaves O
of O
bread O
and O
gave O
thanks O
for O
them O
. O

Then O
he O
gave O
them O
to O
the O
people O
who O
were O
waiting O
to O
eat O
. O

He O
did O
the O
same O
with O
the O
fish O
. O

He O
gave O
them O
as O
much O
as O
they O
wanted O
. O

They O
all O
had O
plenty O
to O
eat O
. O

When O
they O
finished O
, O
Jesus O
said O
to O
his O
followers O
, O
`` O
Gather O
the O
pieces O
of O
fish O
and O
bread O
that O
were O
not O
eaten O
. O

Do O
n't O
waste O
anything O
. O
'' O

So O
they O
gathered O
up O
the O
pieces O
that O
were O
left O
. O

The O
people O
had O
started O
eating O
with O
only O
five O
loaves O
of O
barley O
bread O
. O

But O
the O
followers O
filled O
twelve O
large O
baskets O
with O
the O
pieces O
of O
food O
that O
were O
left O
. O

The O
people O
saw O
this O
miraculous O
sign O
that O
Jesus O
did O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
He O
must O
be O
the O
Prophet O
who O
is O
coming O
into O
the O
world O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
knew O
that O
the O
people O
planned O
to O
come O
get O
him O
and O
make O
him O
their O
king O
. O

So O
he O
left O
and O
went O
into O
the O
hills O
alone O
. O

That O
evening O
Jesus O
' O
followers O
went O
down O
to O
the O
lake O
. O

It O
was O
dark O
now O
, O
and O
Jesus O
had O
not O
yet O
come O
back O
to O
them O
. O

They O
got O
into O
a O
boat O
and O
started O
going O
across O
the O
lake O
to O
Capernaum O
. O

The O
wind O
was O
blowing O
very O
hard O
. O

The O
waves O
on O
the O
lake O
were O
becoming O
bigger O
. O

They O
rowed O
the O
boat O
about O
three O
or O
four O
miles O
. O

Then O
they O
saw O
Jesus O
. O

He O
was O
walking O
on O
the O
water O
, O
coming O
to O
the O
boat O
. O

They O
were O
afraid O
. O

But O
he O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
be O
afraid O
. O

It O
's O
me O
. O
'' O

When O
he O
said O
this O
, O
they O
were O
glad O
to O
take O
him O
into O
the O
boat O
. O

And O
then O
the O
boat O
reached O
the O
shore O
at O
the O
place O
they O
wanted O
to O
go O
. O

The O
next O
day O
came O
. O

Some O
people O
had O
stayed O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
lake O
. O

They O
knew O
that O
Jesus O
did O
not O
go O
with O
his O
followers O
in O
the O
boat O
. O

They O
knew O
that O
the O
followers O
had O
left O
in O
the O
boat O
alone O
. O

And O
they O
knew O
it O
was O
the O
only O
boat O
that O
was O
there O
. O

But O
then O
some O
boats O
from O
Tiberias O
came O
and O
landed O
near O
the O
place O
where O
the O
people O
had O
eaten O
the O
day O
before O
. O

This O
was O
where O
they O
had O
eaten O
the O
bread O
after O
the O
Lord O
gave O
thanks O
. O

The O
people O
saw O
that O
Jesus O
and O
his O
followers O
were O
not O
there O
now O
. O

So O
they O
got O
into O
the O
boats O
and O
went O
to O
Capernaum O
to O
find O
Jesus O
. O

The O
people O
found O
Jesus O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
lake O
. O

They O
asked O
him O
, O
`` O
Teacher O
, O
when O
did O
you O
come O
here O
? O
'' O

He O
answered O
, O
`` O
Why O
are O
you O
looking O
for O
me O
? O

Is O
it O
because O
you O
saw O
miraculous O
signs O
? O

The O
truth O
is O
, O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
me O
because O
you O
ate O
the O
bread O
and O
were O
satisfied O
. O

But O
earthly O
food O
spoils O
and O
ruins O
. O

So O
do O
n't O
work O
to O
get O
that O
kind O
of O
food O
. O

But O
work O
to O
get O
the O
food O
that O
stays O
good O
and O
gives O
you O
eternal O
life O
. O

The O
Son O
of O
Man O
will O
give O
you O
that O
food O
. O

He O
is O
the O
only O
one O
qualified O
by O
God O
the O
Father O
to O
give O
it O
to O
you O
. O
'' O

The O
people O
asked O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
What O
does O
God O
want O
us O
to O
do O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
The O
work O
God O
wants O
you O
to O
do O
is O
this O
: O
to O
believe O
in O
the O
one O
he O
sent O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
people O
asked O
, O
`` O
What O
miraculous O
sign O
will O
you O
do O
for O
us O
? O

If O
we O
can O
see O
you O
do O
a O
miracle O
, O
then O
we O
will O
believe O
you O
. O

What O
will O
you O
do O
? O

Our O
ancestors O
were O
given O
manna O
to O
eat O
in O
the O
desert O
. O

As O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
' O
He O
gave O
them O
bread O
from O
heaven O
to O
eat O
. O
' O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
can O
assure O
you O
that O
Moses O
was O
not O
the O
one O
who O
gave O
your O
people O

heaven O

But O
my O
Father O
gives O
you O
the O
true O
bread O
from O

God O

the O
one O
who O
comes O
down O
from O

and O
gives O

The O
people O
said O
, O
`` O
Sir O
, O
from O
now O
on O
give O
us O
bread O
like O
that O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O

No O

down O

what O

not O
what O
I O

I O
must O
not O

I O

up O

the O

what O
my O

'' O

Some O
Jews O
began O
to O
complain O
about O
Jesus O
because O
he O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
the O
bread O
that O
comes O
down O

They O
said O

all O

was O

-LRB- O
Jesus O
knew O
the O
people O

did O
not O
believe O

He O
knew O
this O
from O
the O
beginning O

And O
he O
knew O
the O
one O
who O
would O
hand O
him O
over O
to O

Jesus O
said O

`` O

After O
Jesus O
said O
these O

many O
of O

left O

Jesus O
asked O
the O
twelve O

`` O
Do O
you O
want O
to O
leave O
too O

Simon O
Peter O
answered O
him O

`` O
Lord O

where O
would O

We O
know O
that O
you O

Holy O

Then O
Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
chose O
all O
twelve O
of O
you O

But O
one O
of O
you O
is O
a O
devil O

He O
was O
talking O
about O
Judas O
, O
the O
son O
of O
Simon O
Iscariot O
. O

Judas O
was O
one O
of O
the O
twelve O
apostles O

but O
later O
he O
would O
hand O
Jesus O
over O
to O
his O
enemies O
. O

`` O
I O
have O
told O
you O
all O
this O
so O
that O
you O
wo O
n't O
lose O
your O
faith O
when O
you O
face O
troubles O

People O
will O
tell O
you O
to O
leave O
their O
synagogues O
and O
never O
come O
back O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
time O
will O
come O
when O
they O
will O
think O
that O
killing O
you O
would O
be O
doing O
service O
for O
God O

They O
will O
do O
this O
because O
they O
have O
not O
known O
the O
Father O

and O
they O
have O
not O
known O
me O

I O
have O
told O
you O
all O

you O

So O
when O
the O
time O
comes O
for O
these O
things O
to O
happen O
, O
you O
will O
remember O
that O
I O
warned O
you O

`` O
I O
did O
not O

Now O
I O

none O
of O
you O
asks O
me O
, O
' O
Where O
are O
you O
going O
? O
' O

But O
you O
are O
filled O
with O
sadness O
because O
I O
have O
told O
you O
all O
this O
. O

Let O
me O
assure O
you O
, O
it O
is O
better O
for O
you O
that O
I O
go O
away O

I O
say O
this O
because O
when O
I O
go O
away O
I O
will O
send O
the O
Helper O
to O
you O
. O

But O
if O
I O
did O
not O
go O
, O
the O
Helper O
would O
not O
come O

`` O
When O
the O
Helper O

wrong O

are O
about O
sin O

about O
being O
right O
with O

and O
about O
judgment O

He O
will O
prove O
that O
they O
are O
guilty O
of O
sin O

they O
do O

He O
will O
show O
them O
how O
wrong O
they O
are O
about O
how O
to O
be O
right O
with O
God O
. O

The O
Helper O
will O
do O
this O
, O
because O
I O
am O
going O
to O
the O
Father O
. O

You O
will O
not O
see O
me O
then O
. O

And O
he O
will O
show O
them O
how O
wrong O
their O
judgment O
is O
, O
because O
their O
leader O
has O
already O
been O
condemned O
. O

`` O
I O
have O
so O
much O
more O
to O
tell O
you O
, O
but O
it O
is O
too O
much O
for O
you O
to O
accept O
now O

But O
when O
the O
Spirit O
of O
truth O
comes O
, O
he O
will O
lead O
you O
into O
all O
truth O

He O
will O
not O
speak O
his O
own O
words O
. O

He O
will O
speak O
only O
what O
he O
hears O
and O
will O
tell O
you O
what O
will O
happen O
in O
the O
future O
. O

The O
Spirit O
of O
truth O
will O
bring O
glory O
to O
me O
by O
telling O
you O
what O
he O
receives O
from O
me O
. O

All O
that O
the O
Father O
has O
is O
mine O

That O
is O
why O
I O
said O
that O
the O
Spirit O

tell O

`` O

Then O
after O
another O
short O
time O
you O
will O
see O
me O
again O
. O
'' O

Some O
of O
the O
followers O
said O
to O
each O
other O
, O
`` O
What O
does O
he O
mean O
when O
he O
says O
, O

Then O
after O
another O
short O

see O

And O
what O
does O
he O
mean O
when O
he O
says O
, O
' O
Because O
I O
am O
going O
to O
the O
Father O
' O
? O
'' O

They O
also O
asked O
, O
`` O
What O
does O
he O
mean O
by O
a O
short O
time O
' O
? O

We O
do O
n't O
understand O
what O
he O
is O
saying O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
saw O
that O
the O
followers O
wanted O
to O
ask O
him O
about O
this O
. O

So O
he O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Are O
you O
asking O
each O
other O
what O
I O
meant O
when O
I O
said O
, O
' O
After O
a O

time O
you O

Then O
after O
another O
short O
time O
you O
will O
see O
me O
again O
' O
? O

The O
truth O
is O
, O
you O
will O
cry O
and O
be O
sad O
, O
but O
the O
world O
will O
be O
happy O
. O

You O
will O
be O
sad O
, O
but O
then O
your O
sadness O
will O
change O
to O
happiness O
. O

`` O
When O
a O
woman O
gives O
birth O
to O
a O
baby O
, O
she O
has O
pain O
, O
because O
her O
time O
has O
come O
. O

But O
when O
her O
baby O
is O
born O
, O
she O
forgets O
the O
pain O
. O

She O
forgets O
because O
she O
is O
so O
happy O
that O
a O
child O
has O
been O
born O
into O
the O
world O
. O

It O
is O
the O
same O
with O
you O

Now O
you O
are O
sad O
, O
but O
I O
will O
see O
you O
again O
, O
and O
you O
will O
be O
happy O

You O
will O
have O
a O
joy O
that O
no O
one O
can O
take O
away O
. O

In O
that O
day O
you O
will O
not O
have O
to O
ask O
me O
about O
anything O

And O
I O
assure O
you O
, O
my O
Father O
will O
give O
you O
anything O
you O
ask O
him O
for O
in O
my O
name O

You O
have O
never O
asked O
for O
anything O
in O
this O
way O
before O
. O

But O
ask O
in O
my O
name O
, O
and O
you O
will O
receive O
. O

And O
you O
will O
have O
the O
fullest O
joy O
possible O
. O

`` O
I O
have O
told O
you O
these O
things O

using O
words O
that O

the O

But O
the O
time O
will O
come O
when O
I O
will O
not O
use O
words O
like O
that O
to O
tell O
you O
things O

I O
will O
speak O
to O
you O
in O
plain O
words O
about O
the O
Father O

Then O
you O
will O
be O
able O
to O
ask O
the O
Father O
for O
things O
in O
my O
name O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
saying O
that O
I O
will O
have O
to O
ask O
the O
Father O
for O
you O

The O
Father O
himself O
loves O
you O
because O
you O
have O
loved O
me O
. O

And O
he O
loves O
you O
because O
you O
have O
believed O
that O
I O
came O
from O
God O

I O
came O
from O
the O
Father O
into O

Now O
I O
am O
leaving O
the O
world O
and O
going O
back O
to O
the O
Father O

'' O

Then O
his O
followers O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
are O
already O
speaking O
plainly O
to O
us O

You O
are O
not O
using O
words O
that O

the O

We O
can O
see O
now O
that O
you O
know O
all O
things O

You O
answer O
our O
questions O
even O
before O
we O
ask O
them O

This O
makes O
us O
believe O
that O
you O
came O
from O
God O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
So O
now O
you O
believe O

Listen O
to O
me O

A O
time O

his O

In O
fact O
, O
that O
time O
is O

here O

You O
will O
leave O
me O

I O
will O
be O
alone O

But O
I O
am O
never O
really O
alone O

the O
Father O
is O
with O

`` O
I O

I O

'' O

Two O
days O
later O
there O
was O
a O
wedding O
in O
the O
town O
of O
Cana O
in O
Galilee O
, O
and O
Jesus O
' O
mother O
was O
there O
. O

Jesus O
and O
his O
followers O
were O
also O
invited O
. O

At O
the O
wedding O
there O
was O
not O
enough O
wine O
, O
so O
Jesus O
' O

mother O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
They O
have O
no O
more O
wine O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
Dear O
woman O
, O
why O
are O
you O
telling O
me O
this O
? O

It O
is O
not O
yet O
time O
for O
me O
to O
begin O
my O
work O
. O
'' O

His O
mother O
said O
to O
the O
servants O
, O
`` O
Do O
what O
he O
tells O
you O
. O
'' O

There O
were O
six O
large O
stone O
waterpots O
there O
that O
were O
used O
by O
the O
Jews O
in O
their O
washing O
ceremonies O
. O

Each O
one O
held O
about O
20 O
or O
30 O
gallons O
. O

Jesus O
said O
to O
the O
servants O
, O
`` O
Fill O
the O
waterpots O
with O
water O
. O
'' O

So O
they O
filled O
them O
to O
the O
top O
. O

Then O
he O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Now O
dip O
out O
some O
water O
and O
take O
it O
to O
the O
man O
in O
charge O
of O
the O
feast O
. O
'' O

So O
they O
did O
what O
he O
said O
. O

Then O
the O
man O
in O
charge O
tasted O
it O
, O
but O
the O
water O
had O
become O
wine O
. O

He O
did O
not O
know O
where O
the O
wine O
had O
come O
from O
, O
but O
the O
servants O
who O
brought O
the O
water O
knew O
. O

He O
called O
the O
bridegroom O
and O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
People O
always O
serve O
the O
best O
wine O
first O
. O

Later O
, O
when O
the O
guests O
are O
drunk O
, O
they O
serve O
the O
cheaper O
wine O
. O

But O
you O
have O
saved O
the O
best O
wine O
until O
now O
. O
'' O

This O
was O
the O
first O
of O
all O
the O
miraculous O
signs O
Jesus O
did O
. O

He O
did O
it O
in O
the O
town O
of O
Cana O
in O
Galilee O
. O

By O
this O
he O
showed O
his O
divine O
greatness O
, O
and O
his O
followers O
believed O
in O
him O
. O

Then O
Jesus O
went O
to O
the O
town O
of O
Capernaum O
. O

His O
mother O
and O
brothers O
and O
his O
followers O
went O
with O
him O
. O

They O
all O
stayed O
there O
a O
few O
days O
. O

It O
was O
almost O
time O
for O
the O
Jewish O
Passover O
, O
so O
Jesus O
went O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

There O
in O
the O
Temple O
area O
he O
saw O
men O
selling O
cattle O
, O
sheep O
, O
and O
doves O
. O

He O
saw O
others O
sitting O
at O
tables O
, O
exchanging O
and O
trading O
people O
's O
money O
. O

Jesus O
made O
a O
whip O
with O
some O
pieces O
of O
rope O
. O

Then O
he O
forced O
all O
these O
men O
and O
the O
sheep O
and O
cattle O
to O
leave O
the O
Temple O
area O
. O

He O
turned O
over O
the O
tables O
of O
the O
money O
traders O
and O
scattered O
their O
money O
. O

Then O
he O
said O
to O
those O
who O
were O
selling O
pigeons O
, O
`` O
Take O
these O
things O
out O
of O
here O
! O

Do O
n't O
make O
my O
Father O
's O
house O
a O
place O
for O
buying O
and O
selling O
! O
'' O

When O
this O
happened O
, O
his O
followers O
remembered O
what O
was O
written O
in O
the O
Scriptures O
: O
`` O
My O
strong O
devotion O
to O
your O
Temple O
will O
destroy O
me O
. O
'' O

Some O
Jews O
said O
to O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
Show O
us O
a O
miracle O
as O
a O
sign O
from O
God O
. O

Prove O
that O
you O
have O
the O
right O
to O
do O
these O
things O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
Destroy O
this O
temple O
and O
I O
will O
build O
it O
again O
in O
three O
days O
. O
'' O

They O
answered O
, O
`` O
People O
worked O
46 O
years O
to O
build O
this O
Temple O
! O

Do O
you O
really O
believe O
you O
can O
build O
it O
again O
in O
three O
days O
? O
'' O

But O
the O
temple O
Jesus O
meant O
was O
his O
own O
body O
. O

After O
he O
was O
raised O
from O
death O
, O
his O
followers O
remembered O
that O
he O
had O
said O
this O
. O

So O
they O
believed O
the O
Scriptures O
, O
and O
they O
believed O
the O
words O
Jesus O
said O
. O

Jesus O
was O
in O
Jerusalem O
for O
the O
Passover O
festival O
. O

Many O
people O
believed O
in O
him O
because O
they O
saw O
the O
miraculous O
signs O
he O
did O
. O

But O
Jesus O
did O
not O
trust O
them O
, O
because O
he O
knew O
how O
all O
people O
think O
. O

He O
did O
not O
need O
anyone O
to O
tell O
him O
what O
a O
person O
was O
like O
. O

He O
already O
knew O
. O

There O
was O
a O
man O
named O
Nicodemus O
, O
one O
of O
the O
Pharisees O
. O

He O
was O
an O
important O
Jewish O
leader O
. O

One O
night O
he O
came O
to O
Jesus O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Teacher O
, O
we O
know O
that O
you O
are O
a O
teacher O
sent O
from O
God O
. O

No O
one O
can O
do O
these O
miraculous O
signs O
that O
you O
do O
unless O
they O
have O
God O
's O
help O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
assure O
you O
, O
everyone O
must O
be O
born O
again O
. O

Anyone O
who O
is O
not O
born O
again O
can O
not O
be O
in O
God O
's O
kingdom O
. O
'' O

Nicodemus O
said O
, O
`` O
How O
can O
a O
man O
who O
is O
already O
old O
be O
born O
again O
? O

Can O
he O
go O
back O
into O
his O
mother O
's O
womb O
and O
be O
born O
a O
second O
time O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
Believe O
me O
when O
I O
say O
that O
everyone O
must O
be O
born O
from O
water O
and O
the O
Spirit O

Anyone O
who O
is O
not O
born O
from O
water O
and O
the O
Spirit O
can O
not O
enter O
God O
's O
kingdom O
. O

The O
only O
life O
people O
get O
from O
their O
human O
parents O
is O
physical O
. O

But O
the O
new O
life O
that O
the O
Spirit O
gives O
a O
person O
is O
spiritual O
. O

Do O
n't O
be O
surprised O
that O
I O
told O
you O
, O

You O
must O
be O
born O
again O

The O
wind O
blows O

it O
wants O
to O

You O
hear O
it O

you O
do O
n't O
know O
where O
it O
is O
coming O
from O
or O
where O
it O
is O
going O

It O
is O
the O
same O
with O
everyone O
who O
is O
born O
from O
the O
Spirit O

'' O

Nicodemus O
asked O
, O
`` O
How O
is O
all O
this O
possible O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
are O
an O
important O
teacher O
of O
Israel O
, O
and O
you O
still O
do O
n't O
understand O

things O
? O

The O
truth O
is O
, O
we O
talk O
about O
what O
we O
know O
. O

We O
tell O
about O
what O
we O
have O
seen O

But O
you O
people O
do O

what O
we O

have O
told O
you O
about O
things O
here O
on O
earth O

but O
you O
do O
not O

So O
I O
'm O
sure O
you O
will O
not O
believe O
me O
if O
I O
tell O
you O
about O
heavenly O
things O
! O

The O
only O
one O
who O
has O
ever O
gone O
up O
to O
heaven O
is O
the O
one O
who O
came O
down O
from O
heaven O

the O
Son O
of O
Man O

`` O
Moses O
lifted O
up O

in O
the O
desert O

It O
is O
the O
same O
with O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O

He O
must O
be O
lifted O
up O
too O

Then O
everyone O
who O
believes O
in O
him O
can O
have O
eternal O
life O

Yes O
, O
God O
loved O
the O
world O
so O
much O
that O
he O
gave O
his O
only O
Son O
, O
so O
that O
everyone O
who O
believes O
in O
him O
would O
not O
be O
lost O
but O
have O
eternal O
life O

God O
sent O
his O
Son O
into O
the O
world O

He O
did O
not O
send O
him O
to O
judge O
the O
world O
guilty O

to O
save O
the O
world O
through O
him O

People O
who O
believe O
in O
God O

are O
not O
judged O
guilty O

But O
people O
who O
do O
not O
believe O
are O
already O
judged O

because O
they O
have O
not O
believed O
in O
God O

only O

They O
are O
judged O
by O
this O
fact O
: O
The O
light O
has O
come O
into O
the O
world O
. O

But O
they O
did O
not O
want O
light O
. O

They O
wanted O
darkness O
, O
because O
they O
were O
doing O
evil O
things O

Everyone O
who O
does O
evil O
hates O
the O
light O

They O
will O
not O
come O

the O
light O

because O
the O
light O
will O
show O
all O
the O
bad O
things O
they O
have O
done O

But O
anyone O
who O
follows O
the O
true O
way O
comes O
to O
the O
light O

Then O
the O
light O
will O
show O
that O
whatever O
they O
have O
done O
was O
done O
through O
God O

After O
this O
, O
Jesus O

went O
into O
the O
area O
of O
Judea O

There O
he O
stayed O

Aenon O
, O
a O
place O
near O
Salim O
with O
plenty O
of O
water O
. O

People O
were O
going O
there O
to O
be O
baptized O
. O

This O
was O
before O
John O
was O
put O
in O
prison O
. O

Some O
of O
John O
's O
followers O
had O
an O
argument O
with O
another O
Jew O
about O
religious O
washing O
. O

Then O
they O
came O
to O
John O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Teacher O
, O
remember O
the O
man O
who O
was O
with O
you O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
Jordan O
River O
? O

He O
is O
the O
one O
you O
were O
telling O
everyone O
about O
. O

He O
is O
also O
baptizing O
people O
, O
and O
many O
are O
going O
to O
him O
. O
'' O

John O
answered O
, O
`` O
A O
person O
can O
receive O
only O
what O
God O
gives O
. O

You O
yourselves O
heard O
me O
say O
, O
' O
I O
am O
not O
the O
Christ O

I O
am O
only O
the O
one O
God O
sent O
to O
prepare O
the O
way O
for O
him O

The O
bride O

belongs O
to O
the O
bridegroom O

The O
friend O
who O
helps O
the O
bridegroom O
just O
waits O
and O
listens O
. O

He O
is O
happy O
just O
to O
hear O
the O
bridegroom O
talk O

That O
's O
how O
I O
feel O
now O
. O

I O
am O
so O
happy O
that O
he O
is O
here O
. O

He O
must O
become O
more O
and O
more O
important O
, O
and O
I O
must O
become O
less O
important O

`` O
The O
one O
who O
comes O
from O
above O
is O
greater O
than O
all O
others O

The O
one O
who O
is O
from O
the O
earth O
belongs O
to O
the O
earth O
. O

He O
talks O
about O
things O
that O
are O
on O
the O
earth O

But O
the O
one O
who O
comes O
from O
heaven O
is O
greater O
than O
all O
others O

He O
tells O
what O
he O
has O
seen O
and O
heard O
, O
but O
people O
do O
n't O
accept O
what O
he O
says O
. O

Whoever O
accepts O
what O
he O
says O
has O
given O
proof O
that O
God O
speaks O
the O
truth O
. O

God O
sent O
him O
, O
and O
he O
tells O
people O
what O
God O
says O
. O

God O
gives O
him O
the O
Spirit O
fully O
. O

The O
Father O
loves O
the O
Son O
and O
has O
given O
him O
power O
over O
everything O

Whoever O
believes O
in O
the O
Son O
has O
eternal O
life O
. O

But O
those O
who O
do O
not O
obey O
the O
Son O
will O
never O
have O
that O
life O
. O

They O
can O
not O
get O
away O
from O
God O
's O
anger O

'' O

Six O
days O
before O
the O
Passover O
festival O
, O
Jesus O
went O
to O
Bethany O
. O

That O
is O
where O
Lazarus O
lived O
, O
the O
man O
Jesus O
raised O
from O
death O
. O

There O
they O
had O
a O
dinner O
for O
Jesus O
. O

Martha O
served O
the O
food O
, O
and O
Lazarus O
was O
one O
of O
the O
people O
eating O
with O
Jesus O
. O

Mary O
brought O
in O
a O
pint O
of O
expensive O
perfume O
made O
of O
pure O
nard O
. O

She O
poured O
the O
perfume O
on O
Jesus O
' O
feet O
. O

Then O
she O
wiped O
his O
feet O
with O
her O
hair O
. O

And O
the O
sweet O
smell O
from O
the O
perfume O
filled O
the O
whole O
house O
. O

Judas O
Iscariot O
, O
one O
of O
Jesus O
' O
followers O
, O
was O
there O
-- O
the O
one O
who O
would O
later O
hand O
Jesus O
over O
to O
his O
enemies O
. O

Judas O
said O
, O
`` O
That O
perfume O
was O
worth O
a O
full O
year O
's O
pay O
. O

It O
should O
have O
been O
sold O
, O
and O
the O
money O
should O
have O
been O
given O
to O
the O
poor O
people O
. O
'' O

But O
Judas O
did O
not O
really O
care O
about O
the O
poor O
. O

He O
said O
this O
because O
he O
was O
a O
thief O
. O

He O
was O
the O
one O
who O
kept O
the O
moneybag O
for O
the O
group O
of O
followers O
. O

And O
he O
often O
stole O
money O
from O
the O
bag O
. O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
stop O
her O
. O

It O
was O
right O
for O
her O
to O
save O
this O
perfume O
for O
today O
-- O
the O
day O
for O
me O
to O
be O
prepared O
for O
burial O
. O

You O
will O
always O
have O
those O
who O
are O
poor O
with O
you O
. O

But O
you O
will O
not O
always O
have O
me O
. O
'' O

Many O
of O
the O
Jews O
heard O
that O
Jesus O
was O
in O
Bethany O
, O
so O
they O
went O
there O
to O
see O
him O
. O

They O
also O
went O
there O
to O
see O
Lazarus O
, O
the O
one O
Jesus O
raised O
from O
death O
. O

So O
the O
leading O
priests O
made O
plans O
to O
kill O
Lazarus O
too O
. O

Because O
of O
him O
, O
many O
Jews O
were O
leaving O
them O
and O
believing O
in O
Jesus O
. O

That O
is O
why O
they O
wanted O
to O
kill O
Lazarus O
too O
. O

The O
next O
day O
the O
people O
in O
Jerusalem O
heard O
that O
Jesus O
was O
coming O
there O
. O

These O
were O
the O
crowds O
of O
people O
who O
had O
come O
to O
the O
Passover O
festival O
. O

They O
took O
branches O
of O
palm O
trees O
and O
went O
out O
to O
meet O
Jesus O
. O

They O
shouted O
, O
`` O
' O
Praise O
Him O
! O
' O
' O

Welcome O
! O

God O
bless O
the O
one O
who O
comes O
in O
the O
name O
of O
the O
Lord O
! O
' O

God O
bless O
the O
King O
of O
Israel O
! O
'' O

Jesus O
found O
a O
donkey O
and O
rode O
on O
it O
, O
as O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
Do O
not O
be O
afraid O
, O
people O
of O
Zion O
! O

Look O
! O

Your O
king O
is O
coming O
. O

He O
is O
riding O
on O
a O
young O
donkey O
. O
'' O

The O
followers O
of O
Jesus O
did O
not O
understand O
at O
that O
time O
what O
was O
happening O
. O

But O
after O
he O
was O
raised O
to O
glory O
, O
they O
understood O
that O
this O
was O
written O
about O
him O
. O

Then O
they O
remembered O
that O
they O
had O
done O
these O
things O
for O
him O
. O

There O
were O
many O
people O
with O
Jesus O
when O
he O
raised O
Lazarus O
from O
death O
and O
told O
him O
to O
come O
out O
of O
the O
tomb O
. O

Now O
they O
were O
telling O
others O
about O
what O
Jesus O
did O
. O

That O
's O
why O
so O
many O
people O
went O
out O
to O
meet O
him O
-- O
because O
they O
had O
heard O
about O
this O
miraculous O
sign O
he O
did O
. O

So O
the O
Pharisees O
said O
to O
each O
other O
, O
`` O
Look O
! O

Our O
plan O
is O
not O
working O
. O

The O
people O
are O
all O
following O
him O
! O
'' O

There O
were O
some O
Greeks O
there O
too O
. O

These O
were O
some O
of O
the O
people O
who O
went O
to O
Jerusalem O
to O
worship O
at O
the O
Passover O
festival O
. O

They O
went O
to O
Philip O
, O
who O
was O
from O
Bethsaida O
in O
Galilee O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Sir O
, O
we O
want O
to O
meet O
Jesus O
. O
'' O

Philip O
went O
and O
told O
Andrew O
. O

Then O
Andrew O
and O
Philip O
went O
and O
told O
Jesus O
. O

Jesus O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
The O
time O
has O
come O
for O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O
to O
receive O
his O
glory O
. O

It O
is O
a O
fact O
that O
a O
grain O
of O
wheat O
must O
fall O
to O
the O
ground O
and O
die O
before O
it O
can O
grow O
and O
produce O
much O
more O
wheat O
. O

If O
it O
never O
dies O
, O
it O
will O
never O
be O
more O
than O
a O
single O
seed O
. O

Whoever O
loves O
the O
life O
they O
have O
now O
will O
lose O
it O
. O

But O
whoever O
is O
willing O
to O
give O
up O
their O
life O
in O
this O
world O
will O
keep O
it O
. O

They O
will O
have O
eternal O
life O
. O

Whoever O
serves O
me O
must O
follow O
me O
. O

My O
servants O
must O
be O
with O
me O
everywhere O
I O
am O
. O

My O
Father O
will O
give O
honor O
to O
anyone O
who O
serves O
me O
. O

`` O
Now O
I O
am O
very O
troubled O
. O

What O
should O
I O
say O
? O

Should O
I O
say O
, O
' O
Father O
save O
me O
from O
this O
time O
of O
suffering O
' O
? O

No O
, O
I O
came O
to O
this O
time O
so O
that O
I O
could O
suffer O
. O

Father O
, O
do O
what O
will O
bring O
you O
glory O
! O
'' O

Then O
a O
voice O
came O
from O
heaven O
, O
`` O
I O
have O
already O
brought O
glory O
to O
myself O
. O

I O
will O
do O
it O
again O
. O
'' O

The O
people O
standing O
there O
heard O
the O
voice O
. O

They O
said O
it O
was O
thunder O
. O

But O
others O
said O
, O
`` O
An O
angel O
spoke O
to O
him O
! O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
That O
voice O
was O
for O
you O
and O
not O
for O
me O
. O

Now O
is O
the O
time O
for O
the O
world O
to O
be O
judged O
. O

Now O
the O
ruler O
of O
this O
world O
will O
be O
thrown O
out O
. O

I O
will O
be O
lifted O
up O
from O
the O
earth O
. O

When O
that O
happens O
, O
I O
will O
draw O
all O
people O
to O
myself O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
this O
to O
show O
how O
he O
would O
die O
. O

The O
people O
said O
, O
`` O
But O
our O
law O
says O
that O
the O
Christ O
will O
live O
forever O
. O

So O
why O
do O
you O
say O
, O
' O
The O
Son O
of O
Man O
must O
be O
lifted O
up O
' O
? O

Who O
is O
this O
' O
Son O
of O
Man O
' O
? O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
light O
will O
be O
with O
you O
for O
only O
a O
short O
time O
more O
. O

So O
walk O
while O
you O
have O
the O
light O
. O

Then O
the O
darkness O
will O
not O
catch O
you O
. O

People O
who O
walk O
in O
the O
darkness O
do O
n't O
know O
where O
they O
are O
going O
. O

So O
put O
your O
trust O
in O
the O
light O
while O
you O
still O
have O
it O
. O

Then O
you O
will O
be O
children O
of O
light O
. O
'' O

When O
Jesus O
finished O
saying O
these O
things O
, O
he O
went O
away O
to O
a O
place O
where O
the O
people O
could O
not O
find O
him O
. O

The O
people O
saw O
all O
these O
miraculous O
signs O
Jesus O
did O
, O
but O
they O
still O
did O
not O
believe O
in O
him O
. O

This O
was O
to O
give O
full O
meaning O
to O
what O
Isaiah O
the O
prophet O
said O
: O
`` O
Lord O
, O
who O
believed O
what O
we O
told O
them O
? O

Who O
has O
seen O
the O
Lord O
's O
power O
? O
'' O

This O
is O
why O
the O
people O
could O
not O
believe O
. O

Because O
Isaiah O
also O
said O
, O
`` O
God O
made O
the O
people O
blind O
. O

He O
closed O
their O
minds O
. O

He O
did O
this O
so O
that O
they O
would O
not O
see O
with O
their O
eyes O
and O
understand O
with O
their O
minds O
. O

He O
did O
it O
so O
that O
they O
would O
not O
turn O
and O
be O
healed O
. O
'' O

Isaiah O
said O
this O
because O
he O
saw O
Jesus O
' O
divine O
greatness O
. O

So O
he O
spoke O
about O
him O
. O

But O
many O
people O
believed O
in O
Jesus O
. O

Even O
many O
of O
the O
Jewish O
leaders O
believed O
in O
him O
, O
but O
they O
were O
afraid O
of O
the O
Pharisees O
, O
so O
they O
did O
not O
say O
openly O
that O
they O
believed O
. O

They O
were O
afraid O
they O
would O
be O
ordered O
to O
stay O
out O
of O
the O
synagogue O
. O

They O
loved O
praise O
from O
people O
more O
than O
praise O
from O
God O
. O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
loudly O
, O
`` O
Everyone O
who O
believes O
in O
me O
is O
really O
believing O
in O
the O
one O
who O
sent O
me O
. O

Everyone O
who O
sees O
me O
is O
really O
seeing O
the O
one O
who O
sent O
me O
. O

I O
came O
into O
this O
world O
as O
a O
light O
. O

I O
came O
so O
that O
everyone O
who O
believes O
in O
me O
will O
not O
stay O
in O
darkness O
. O

`` O
I O
did O
not O
come O
into O
the O
world O
to O
judge O
people O
. O

I O
came O
to O
save O
the O
people O
in O
the O
world O
. O

So O
I O
am O
not O
the O
one O
who O
judges O
those O
who O
hear O
my O
teaching O
and O
do O
not O
obey O
. O

But O
there O
is O
a O
judge O
for O
all O
those O
who O
refuse O
to O
believe O
in O
me O
and O
do O
not O
accept O
what O
I O
say O
. O

The O
message O
I O
have O
spoken O
will O
judge O
them O
on O
the O
last O
day O
. O

That O
is O
because O
what O
I O
taught O
was O
not O
from O
myself O
. O

The O
Father O
who O
sent O
me O
told O
me O
what O
to O
say O
and O
what O
to O
teach O
. O

And O
I O
know O
that O
whatever O
he O
says O
to O
do O
will O
bring O
eternal O
life O
. O

So O
the O
things O
I O
say O
are O
exactly O
what O
the O
Father O
told O
me O
to O
say O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
learned O
that O
the O
Pharisees O
had O
heard O
the O
report O
that O
he O
was O
making O
and O
baptizing O
more O
followers O
than O
John O
. O

-LRB- O
But O
really O
, O
Jesus O
himself O
did O
not O
baptize O
anyone O
; O
his O
followers O
baptized O
people O
for O
him O
. O
-RRB- O

So O
he O
left O
Judea O
and O
went O
back O
to O
Galilee O
. O

On O
the O
way O
to O
Galilee O
he O
had O
to O
go O
through O
the O
country O
of O
Samaria O
. O

In O
Samaria O
Jesus O
came O
to O
the O
town O
called O
Sychar O
, O
which O
is O
near O
the O
field O
that O
Jacob O
gave O
to O
his O
son O
Joseph O
. O

Jacob O
's O
well O
was O
there O
. O

Jesus O
was O
tired O
from O
his O
long O
trip O
, O
so O
he O
sat O
down O
beside O
the O
well O
. O

It O
was O
about O
noon O
. O

A O
Samaritan O
woman O
came O
to O
the O
well O
to O
get O
some O
water O
, O
and O
Jesus O
said O
to O
her O
, O
`` O
Please O
give O
me O
a O
drink O
. O
'' O

This O
happened O
while O
his O
followers O
were O
in O
town O
buying O
some O
food O
. O

The O
woman O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
surprised O
that O
you O
ask O
me O
for O
a O

You O
are O
a O
Jew O

-LRB- O
Jews O
have O
nothing O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O

one O
who O
gave O
us O
this O
well O
. O

He O
drank O
from O
it O
himself O
, O
and O
his O
sons O
and O
all O
his O
animals O
drank O
from O
it O
too O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
Everyone O
who O
drinks O
this O
water O
will O
be O
thirsty O
again O
. O

But O
anyone O
who O
drinks O
the O
water O
I O
give O
will O
never O
be O
thirsty O
again O
. O

The O
water O
I O
give O
people O
will O
be O
like O
a O
spring O
flowing O
inside O
them O
. O

It O
will O
bring O
them O
eternal O
life O
. O
'' O

The O
woman O
said O
to O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
Sir O
, O
give O
me O
this O
water O
. O

Then O
I O
will O
never O
be O
thirsty O
again O
and O
wo O
n't O
have O
to O
come O
back O
here O
to O
get O
more O
water O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
told O
her O
, O
`` O
Go O
get O
your O
husband O
and O
come O
back O
. O
'' O

The O
woman O
answered O
, O
`` O
But O
I O
have O
no O
husband O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
to O
her O
, O
`` O
You O
are O
right O
to O
say O
you O
have O
no O
husband O
. O

That O
's O
because O
, O
although O
you O
have O
had O
five O
husbands O
, O
the O
man O
you O
live O
with O
now O
is O
not O
your O
husband O
. O

That O
much O
was O
the O
truth O
. O
'' O

The O
woman O
said O
, O
`` O
Sir O
, O
I O
can O
see O
that O
you O
are O
a O
prophet O
. O

Our O
fathers O
worshiped O
on O
this O
mountain O
. O

But O
you O
Jews O
say O
that O
Jerusalem O
is O
the O
place O
where O
people O
must O
worship O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Believe O
me O
, O
woman O
! O

The O
time O
is O
coming O
when O
you O
will O
not O
have O
to O
be O
in O
Jerusalem O
or O
on O
this O
mountain O
to O
worship O
the O
Father O
. O

You O
Samaritans O
worship O
something O
you O
do O
n't O
understand O
. O

We O
Jews O
understand O
what O
we O
worship O
, O
since O
salvation O
comes O
from O
the O
Jews O
. O

But O
the O
time O
is O
coming O
when O
the O
true O
worshipers O
will O
worship O
the O
Father O
in O
spirit O
and O
truth O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
that O
time O
is O
now O
here O
. O

And O
these O
are O
the O
kind O
of O
people O
the O
Father O
wants O
to O
be O
his O
worshipers O
. O

God O
is O
spirit O
. O

So O
the O
people O
who O
worship O
him O
must O
worship O
in O
spirit O
and O
truth O
. O
'' O

The O
woman O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
know O
that O
the O
Messiah O
is O
coming O
. O
'' O

-LRB- O
Messiah O
is O
the O
one O
called O
Christ O
. O
-RRB- O

`` O
When O
he O
comes O
, O
he O
will O
explain O
everything O
to O
us O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
He O
is O
talking O
to O
you O
now O
-- O
I O
am O
the O
Messiah O
. O
'' O

Just O
then O
Jesus O
' O
followers O
came O
back O
from O
town O
. O

They O
were O
surprised O
because O
they O
saw O
Jesus O
talking O
with O
a O
woman O
. O

But O
none O
of O
them O
asked O
, O
`` O
What O
do O
you O
want O
? O
'' O

or O
`` O
Why O
are O
you O
talking O
with O
her O
? O
'' O

Then O
the O
woman O
left O
her O
water O
jar O
and O
went O
back O
to O
town O
. O

She O
told O
the O
people O
there O
, O
`` O
A O
man O
told O
me O
everything O
I O
have O
ever O
done O
. O

Come O
see O
him O
. O

Maybe O
he O
is O
the O
Christ O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
people O
left O
the O
town O
and O
went O
to O
see O
Jesus O
. O

While O
the O
woman O
was O
in O
town O
, O
Jesus O
' O
followers O
were O
begging O
him O
, O
`` O
Teacher O
, O
eat O
something O
! O
'' O

But O
Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
have O
food O
to O
eat O
that O
you O
know O
nothing O
about O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
followers O
asked O
themselves O
, O
`` O
Did O
someone O
already O
bring O
him O
some O
food O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
My O
food O
is O
to O
do O
what O
the O
one O
who O
sent O
me O
wants O
me O
to O
do O
. O

My O
food O
is O
to O
finish O
the O
work O
that O
he O
gave O
me O
to O
do O
. O

When O
you O
plant O
, O
you O
always O
say O
, O
' O
Four O
more O
months O
to O
wait O
before O
we O
gather O
the O
grain O
. O
' O

But O
I O
tell O
you O
, O
open O
your O
eyes O
, O
and O
look O
at O
the O
fields O
. O

They O
are O
ready O
for O
harvesting O
now O
. O

Even O
now O
, O
the O
people O
who O
harvest O
the O
crop O
are O
being O
paid O
. O

They O
are O
gathering O
crops O
for O
eternal O
life O
. O

So O
now O
the O
people O
who O
plant O
can O
be O
happy O
together O
with O
those O
who O
harvest O
. O

It O
is O
true O
when O
we O
say O
, O
' O
One O
person O
plants O
, O
but O
another O
person O
harvests O
the O
crop O
. O
' O

I O
sent O
you O
to O
harvest O
a O
crop O
that O
you O
did O
not O
work O
for O
. O

Others O
did O
the O
work O
, O
and O
you O
get O
the O
profit O
from O
their O
work O
. O
'' O

Many O
of O
the O
Samaritan O
people O
in O
that O
town O
believed O
in O
Jesus O
. O

They O
believed O
because O
of O
what O
the O
woman O
had O
told O
them O
about O
him O
. O

She O
had O
told O
them O
, O
`` O
He O
told O
me O
everything O
I O
have O
ever O
done O
. O
'' O

The O
Samaritans O
went O
to O
Jesus O
. O

They O
begged O
him O
to O
stay O
with O
them O
. O

So O
he O
stayed O
there O
two O
days O
. O

Many O
more O
people O
became O
believers O
because O
of O
the O
things O
he O
said O
. O

The O
people O
said O
to O
the O
woman O
, O
`` O
First O
we O
believed O
in O
Jesus O
because O
of O
what O
you O
told O
us O
. O

But O
now O
we O
believe O
because O
we O
heard O
him O
ourselves O
. O

We O
know O
now O
that O
he O
really O
is O
the O
one O
who O
will O
save O
the O
world O
. O
'' O

Two O
days O
later O
Jesus O
left O
and O
went O
to O
Galilee O
. O

-LRB- O
Jesus O
had O
said O
before O
that O
a O
prophet O
is O
not O
respected O
in O
his O
own O
country O
. O
-RRB- O

When O
he O
arrived O
in O
Galilee O
, O
the O
people O
there O
welcomed O
him O
. O

They O
had O
been O
at O
the O
Passover O
festival O
in O
Jerusalem O
and O
had O
seen O
everything O
he O
did O
there O
. O

Jesus O
went O
to O
visit O
Cana O
in O
Galilee O
again O
. O

Cana O
is O
where O
he O
had O
changed O
the O
water O
into O
wine O
. O

One O
of O
the O
king O
's O
important O
officials O
lived O
in O
the O
city O
of O
Capernaum O
. O

This O
man O
's O
son O
was O
sick O
. O

The O
man O
heard O
that O
Jesus O
had O
come O
from O
Judea O
and O
was O
now O
in O
Galilee O
. O

So O
he O
went O
to O
Jesus O
and O
begged O
him O
to O
come O
to O
Capernaum O
and O
heal O
his O
son O
, O
who O
was O
almost O
dead O
. O

Jesus O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
You O
people O
must O
see O
miraculous O
signs O
and O
wonders O
before O
you O
will O
believe O
in O
me O
. O
'' O

The O
king O
's O
official O
said O
, O
`` O
Sir O
, O
come O
before O
my O
little O
son O
dies O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
Go O
. O

Your O
son O
will O
live O
. O
'' O

The O
man O
believed O
what O
Jesus O
told O
him O
and O
went O
home O
. O

On O
the O
way O
home O
the O
man O
's O
servants O
came O
and O
met O
him O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Your O
son O
is O
well O
. O
'' O

The O
man O
asked O
, O
`` O
What O
time O
did O
my O
son O
begin O
to O
get O
well O
? O
'' O

They O
answered O
, O
`` O
It O
was O
about O
one O
o'clock O
yesterday O
when O
the O
fever O
left O
him O
. O
'' O

The O
father O
knew O
that O
one O
o'clock O
was O
the O
same O
time O
that O
Jesus O
had O
said O
, O
`` O
Your O
son O
will O
live O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
man O
and O
everyone O
in O
his O
house O
believed O
in O
Jesus O
. O

That O
was O
the O
second O
miraculous O
sign O
that O
Jesus O
did O
after O
coming O
from O
Judea O
to O
Galilee O
. O

Later O
, O
Jesus O
appeared O
again O
to O
his O
followers O
by O
Lake O
Galilee O
. O

This O
is O
how O
it O
happened O
: O
Some O
of O
the O
followers O
were O
together O
-- O
Simon O
Peter O
, O
Thomas O
-LRB- O
called O
Didymus O
-RRB- O
, O
Nathanael O
from O
Cana O
in O
Galilee O
, O
the O
two O
sons O
of O
Zebedee O
, O
and O
two O
other O
followers O
. O

Simon O
Peter O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
going O
out O
to O
fish O
. O
'' O

The O
other O
followers O
said O
, O
`` O
We O
will O
go O
with O
you O
. O
'' O

So O
all O
of O
them O
went O
out O
and O
got O
into O
the O
boat O
. O

They O
fished O
that O
night O
but O
caught O
nothing O
. O

Early O
the O
next O
morning O
Jesus O
stood O
on O
the O
shore O
. O

But O
the O
followers O
did O
not O
know O
it O
was O
Jesus O
. O

Then O
he O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Friends O
, O
have O
you O
caught O
any O
fish O
? O
'' O

They O
answered O
, O
`` O
No O
. O
'' O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Throw O
your O
net O
into O
the O
water O
on O
the O
right O
side O
of O
your O
boat O
. O

You O
will O
find O
some O
fish O
there O
. O
'' O

So O
they O
did O
this O
. O

They O
caught O
so O
many O
fish O
that O
they O
could O
not O
pull O
the O
net O
back O
into O
the O
boat O
. O

The O
follower O
Jesus O
loved O
very O
much O
said O
to O
Peter O
, O
`` O
That O
man O
is O
the O
Lord O
! O
'' O

When O
Peter O
heard O
him O
say O
it O
was O
the O
Lord O
, O
he O
wrapped O
his O
coat O
around O
himself O
. O

-LRB- O
He O
had O
taken O
his O
clothes O
off O
to O
work O
. O
-RRB- O

Then O
he O
jumped O
into O
the O
water O
. O

The O
other O
followers O
went O
to O
shore O
in O
the O
boat O
. O

They O
pulled O
the O
net O
full O
of O
fish O
. O

They O
were O
not O
very O
far O
from O
shore O
, O
only O
about O
100 O
yards O
. O

When O
they O
stepped O
out O
of O
the O
boat O
and O
onto O
the O
shore O
, O
they O
saw O
a O
fire O
of O
hot O
coals O
. O

There O
were O
fish O
on O
the O
fire O
and O
some O
bread O
there O
too O
. O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Bring O
some O
of O
the O
fish O
that O
you O
caught O
. O
'' O

Simon O
Peter O
got O
into O
the O
boat O
and O
pulled O
the O
net O
to O
the O
shore O
. O

It O
was O
full O
of O
big O
fish O
-- O
153 O
of O
them O
! O

But O
even O
with O
that O
many O
fish O
, O
the O
net O
did O
not O
tear O
. O

Jesus O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Come O
and O
eat O
. O
'' O

None O
of O
the O
followers O
would O
ask O
him O
, O
`` O
Who O
are O
you O
? O
'' O

They O
knew O
he O
was O
the O
Lord O
. O

Jesus O
walked O
over O
to O
get O
the O
bread O
and O
gave O
it O
to O
them O
. O

He O
also O
gave O
them O
the O
fish O
. O

This O
was O
now O
the O
third O
time O
Jesus O
appeared O
to O
his O
followers O
after O
he O
was O
raised O
from O
death O
. O

When O
they O
finished O
eating O
, O
Jesus O
said O
to O
Simon O
Peter O
, O
`` O
Simon O
, O
son O
of O
John O
, O
do O
you O
love O
me O
more O
than O
these O
other O
men O
love O
me O
? O
'' O

Peter O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
Lord O
, O
you O
know O
that O
I O
love O
you O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Take O
care O
of O
my O
lambs O
. O
'' O

Again O
Jesus O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Simon O
, O
son O
of O
John O
, O
do O
you O
love O
me O
? O
'' O

Peter O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
Lord O
, O
you O
know O
that O
I O
love O
you O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Take O
care O
of O
my O
sheep O
. O
'' O

A O
third O
time O
Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Simon O
, O
son O
of O
John O
, O
do O
you O
love O
me O
? O
'' O

Peter O
was O
sad O
because O
Jesus O
asked O
him O
three O
times O
, O
`` O
Do O
you O
love O
me O
? O
'' O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
you O
know O
everything O
. O

You O
know O
that O
I O
love O
you O
! O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Take O
care O
of O
my O
sheep O
. O

The O
truth O
is O
, O
when O
you O
were O
young O
, O
you O
tied O
your O
own O
belt O
and O
went O
where O
you O
wanted O
. O

But O
when O
you O
are O
old O
, O
you O
will O
put O
out O
your O
hands O
, O
and O
someone O
else O
will O
tie O
your O
belt O
. O

They O
will O
lead O
you O
where O
you O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
go O
. O
'' O

-LRB- O
Jesus O
said O
this O
to O
show O
how O
Peter O
would O
die O
to O
give O
glory O
to O
God O
. O
-RRB- O

Then O
he O
said O
to O
Peter O
, O
`` O
Follow O
me O
! O
'' O

Peter O
turned O
and O
saw O
the O
follower O
Jesus O
loved O
very O
much O
walking O
behind O
them O
. O

-LRB- O
This O
was O
the O
follower O
who O
had O
leaned O
against O
Jesus O
at O
the O
supper O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
who O
is O
it O
that O
will O
hand O
you O
over O
? O
'' O

-RRB- O
When O
Peter O
saw O
him O
behind O
them O
, O
he O
asked O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
what O
about O
him O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
Maybe O
I O
want O
him O
to O
live O
until O
I O
come O
. O

That O
should O
not O
matter O
to O
you O
. O

You O
follow O
me O
! O
'' O

So O
a O
story O
spread O
among O
the O
followers O
of O
Jesus O
. O

They O
were O
saying O
that O
this O
follower O
would O
not O
die O
. O

But O
Jesus O
did O
not O
say O
he O
would O
not O
die O
. O

He O
only O
said O
, O
`` O
Maybe O
I O
want O
him O
to O
live O
until O
I O
come O
. O

That O
should O
not O
matter O
to O
you O
. O
'' O

That O
follower O
is O
the O
one O
who O
is O
telling O
these O
things O
. O

He O
is O
the O
one O
who O
has O
now O
written O
them O
all O
down O
. O

We O
know O
that O
what O
he O
says O
is O
true O
. O

There O
are O
many O
other O
things O
that O
Jesus O
did O
. O

If O
every O
one O
of O
them O
were O
written O
down O
, O
I O
think O
the O
whole O
world O
would O
not O
be O
big O
enough O
for O
all O
the O
books O
that O
would O
be O
written O
. O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O

trust O
in O
me O

There O
are O
many O
rooms O
in O
my O
Father O

house O

I O
would O
not O
tell O
you O
this O
if O
it O
were O
not O
true O

I O
am O
going O
there O
to O
prepare O

After O
I O
go O
and O
prepare O
a O
place O
for O
you O
, O
I O
will O
come O
back O

Then O
I O
will O
take O
you O
with O
me O
, O
so O
that O
you O
can O
be O
where O
I O
am O

You O
know O
the O
way O

the O
place O

I O

Thomas O
said O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
we O
do O
n't O
know O
where O
you O
are O
going O

so O
how O
can O
we O
know O
the O
way O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
the O
way O

the O
truth O

and O
the O
life O

The O
only O
way O

the O
Father O
is O
through O
me O

If O
you O
really O
knew O
me O

you O
would O
know O

But O
now O
you O
know O
the O
Father O

You O
have O
seen O
him O

Philip O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
show O
us O
the O
Father O

That O
is O
all O
we O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
Philip O
, O
I O
have O
been O
with O
you O

long O
time O

So O
you O

me O

Anyone O
who O
has O

seen O

So O
why O
do O
you O
say O
, O
' O
Show O
us O
the O
Father O

Do O
n't O
you O
believe O
that O
I O
am O
in O
the O
Father O

the O
Father O

in O
me O

The O
things O
I O
have O
told O
you O
do O
n't O
come O
from O
me O

The O
Father O
lives O
in O
me O

and O
he O
is O
doing O
his O
own O
work O

Believe O
me O
when O
I O
say O
that O
I O
am O
in O
the O
Father O
and O
the O
Father O
is O
in O
me O

Or O
believe O
because O
of O
the O
miracles O
I O
have O
done O

`` O
I O
can O
assure O
you O
that O
whoever O
believes O
in O

will O
do O
the O

things O

have O
done O

And O
they O
will O
do O
even O
greater O
things O
than O
I O
have O
done O

because O
I O
am O
going O
to O
the O
Father O

And O
if O
you O
ask O
for O
anything O
in O
my O
name O
, O
I O
will O
do O
it O
for O
you O

Then O
the O
Father O

If O
you O

`` O
If O

Father O

and O
he O
will O
give O
you O
another O
Helper O

forever O

The O
Helper O
is O
the O
Spirit O
of O
truth O
. O

The O
people O
of O
the O
world O
can O
not O
accept O
him O
, O
because O
they O
do O
n't O
see O
him O
or O
know O
him O

But O
you O
know O
him O

He O
lives O
with O

and O
he O
will O
be O
in O

`` O
I O

I O

In O
a O
very O
short O
time O
the O
people O
in O

you O
will O
see O

You O
will O
live O
because O
I O
live O

On O
that O
day O
you O
will O
know O
that O
I O
am O
in O
the O
Father O

You O
will O
know O
that O
you O
are O
in O
me O
and O
I O
am O
in O

Those O
who O
really O
love O

are O
the O
ones O
who O
not O

know O
my O

also O
obey O

My O

I O
will O
love O

I O
will O
make O
myself O
known O

'' O

Then O
Judas O
-LRB- O
not O
Judas O
Iscariot O
-RRB- O
said O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
how O
will O
you O
make O
yourself O
known O

not O
to O

'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
All O
who O
love O
me O
will O
obey O
my O
teaching O

My O
Father O
will O
love O
them O

My O
Father O
and O
I O
will O
come O
to O
them O
and O
live O
with O
them O
. O

But O
anyone O
who O
does O
not O
love O
me O
does O
not O
obey O
my O
teaching O
. O

This O
teaching O
that O
you O
hear O
is O
not O
really O
mine O
. O

It O
is O
from O
my O
Father O
who O
sent O
me O
. O

`` O
I O
have O
told O
you O
all O
these O
things O
while O
I O
am O
with O
you O
. O

But O
the O
Helper O
will O
teach O
you O
everything O
and O
cause O
you O
to O
remember O
all O
that O
I O
told O
you O
. O

This O
Helper O
is O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
that O
the O
Father O
will O
send O
in O
my O
name O
. O

`` O
I O
leave O
you O
peace O
. O

It O
is O
my O
own O
peace O
I O
give O
you O
. O

I O
give O
you O
peace O
in O
a O
different O
way O
than O
the O
world O
does O
. O

So O
do O
n't O
be O
troubled O
. O

Do O
n't O
be O
afraid O
. O

You O
heard O
me O
say O
to O
you O
, O
' O
I O
am O
leaving O
, O
but O
I O
will O
come O
back O
to O
you O
. O
' O

If O
you O
loved O
me O
, O
you O
would O
be O
happy O
that O
I O
am O
going O
back O
to O
the O
Father O
, O
because O
the O
Father O
is O
greater O
than O
I O
am O
. O

I O
have O
told O
you O
this O
now O
, O
before O
it O
happens O
. O

Then O
when O
it O
happens O
, O
you O
will O
believe O
. O

`` O
I O
will O
not O
talk O
with O
you O
much O
longer O
. O

The O
ruler O
of O
this O
world O
is O
coming O
. O

He O
has O
no O
power O
over O
me O
. O

But O
the O
world O
must O
know O
that O
I O
love O
the O
Father O
. O

So O
I O
do O
exactly O
what O
the O
Father O
told O
me O
to O
do O
. O

`` O
Come O
now O
, O
let O
's O
go O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
went O
to O
the O
Mount O
of O
Olives O
. O

Early O
in O
the O
morning O
he O
went O
back O
to O
the O
Temple O
area O
. O

The O
people O
all O
came O
to O
him O
, O
and O
he O
sat O
and O
taught O
them O
. O

The O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
and O
the O
Pharisees O
brought O
a O
woman O
they O
had O
caught O
in O
bed O
with O
a O
man O
who O
was O
not O
her O
husband O
. O

They O
forced O
her O
to O
stand O
in O
front O
of O
the O
people O
. O

They O
said O
to O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
Teacher O
, O
this O
woman O
was O
caught O
in O
the O
act O
of O
adultery O
. O

The O
Law O
of O
Moses O
commands O
us O
to O
stone O
to O
death O
any O
such O
woman O
. O

What O
do O
you O
say O
we O
should O
do O
? O
'' O

They O
were O
saying O
this O
to O
trick O
Jesus O
. O

They O
wanted O
to O
catch O
him O
saying O
something O
wrong O
so O
that O
they O
could O
have O
a O
charge O
against O
him O
. O

But O
Jesus O
stooped O
down O
and O
started O
writing O
on O
the O
ground O
with O
his O
finger O
. O

The O
Jewish O
leaders O
continued O
to O
ask O
him O
their O
question O
. O

So O
he O
stood O
up O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Anyone O
here O
who O
has O
never O
sinned O
should O
throw O
the O
first O
stone O
at O
her O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
stooped O
down O
again O
and O
wrote O
on O
the O
ground O
. O

When O
they O
heard O
this O
, O
they O
began O
to O
leave O
one O
by O
one O
. O

The O
older O
men O
left O
first O
, O
and O
then O
the O
others O
. O

Jesus O
was O
left O
alone O
with O
the O
woman O
standing O
there O
in O
front O
of O
him O
. O

He O
looked O
up O
again O
and O
said O
to O
her O
, O
`` O
Where O
did O
they O
all O
go O
? O

Did O
no O
one O
judge O
you O
guilty O
? O
'' O

She O
answered O
, O
`` O
No O
one O
, O
sir O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
do O
n't O
judge O
you O
either O
. O

You O
can O
go O
now O
, O
but O
do O
n't O
sin O
again O
. O
'' O

Later O
, O
Jesus O
talked O
to O
the O
people O
again O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
the O
light O
of O
the O
world O
. O

Whoever O
follows O
me O
will O
never O
live O
in O
darkness O
. O

They O
will O
have O
the O
light O
that O
gives O
life O
. O
'' O

But O
the O
Pharisees O
said O
to O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
When O
you O
talk O
about O
yourself O
, O
you O
are O
the O
only O
one O
to O
say O
that O
these O
things O
are O
true O
. O

So O
we O
can O
not O
accept O
what O
you O
say O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
I O
am O
saying O
these O
things O
about O
myself O
. O

But O
people O
can O
believe O
what O
I O
say O
, O
because O
I O
know O
where O
I O
came O
from O
. O

And O
I O
know O
where O
I O
am O
going O
. O

But O
you O
do O
n't O
know O
where O
I O
came O
from O
or O
where O
I O
am O
going O
. O

You O
judge O
me O
the O
way O
people O
judge O
other O
people O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
judge O
anyone O
. O

But O
if O
I O
judge O
, O
my O
judging O
is O
true O
, O
because O
when O
I O
judge O
I O
am O
not O
alone O
. O

The O
Father O
who O
sent O
me O
is O
with O
me O
. O

Your O
own O
law O
says O
that O
when O
two O
witnesses O
say O
the O
same O
thing O
, O
you O
must O
accept O
what O
they O
say O
. O

I O
am O
one O
of O
the O
witnesses O
who O
speaks O
about O
myself O
. O

And O
the O
Father O
who O
sent O
me O
is O
my O
other O
witness O
. O
'' O

The O
people O
asked O
, O
`` O
Where O
is O
your O
father O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
You O
do O
n't O
know O
me O
or O
my O
Father O
. O

But O
if O
you O
knew O
me O
, O
you O
would O
know O
my O
Father O
too O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
these O
things O
while O
he O
was O
teaching O
in O
the O
Temple O
area O
, O
near O
the O
room O
where O
the O
Temple O
offerings O
were O
kept O
. O

But O
no O
one O
arrested O
him O
, O
because O
the O
right O
time O
for O
him O
had O
not O
yet O
come O
. O

Again O
, O
Jesus O
said O
to O
the O
people O
, O
`` O
I O
will O
leave O
you O
. O

You O
will O
look O
for O
me O
, O
but O
you O
will O
die O
in O
your O
sin O
. O

You O
can O
not O
come O
where O
I O
am O
going O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
Jewish O
leaders O
asked O
themselves O
, O
`` O
Will O
he O
kill O
himself O
? O

Is O
that O
why O
he O
said O
, O
' O
You O
can O
not O
come O
where O
I O
am O
going O
' O
? O
'' O

But O
Jesus O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
You O
people O
are O
from O
here O
below O
, O
but O
I O
am O
from O
above O
. O

You O
belong O
to O
this O
world O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
belong O
to O
this O
world O
. O

I O
told O
you O
that O
you O
would O
die O
in O
your O
sins O
. O

Yes O
, O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
believe O
that O
I O
AM O
, O
you O
will O
die O
in O
your O
sins O
. O
'' O

They O
asked O
, O
`` O
Then O
who O
are O
you O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
what O
I O
have O
told O
you O
from O
the O
beginning O
. O

I O
have O
much O
more O
I O
could O
say O
to O
judge O
you O
. O

But O
I O
tell O
people O
only O
what O
I O
have O
heard O
from O
the O
one O
who O
sent O
me O
, O
and O
he O
speaks O
the O
truth O
. O
'' O

They O
did O
not O
understand O
who O
he O
was O
talking O
about O
. O

He O
was O
telling O
them O
about O
the O
Father O
. O

So O
he O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
You O
will O
lift O
up O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O
. O

Then O
you O
will O
know O
that O
I O
AM O
. O

You O
will O
know O
that O
whatever O
I O
do O
is O
not O
by O
my O
own O
authority O
. O

You O
will O
know O
that O
I O
say O
only O
what O
the O
Father O
has O
taught O
me O
. O

The O
one O
who O
sent O
me O
is O
with O
me O
. O

I O
always O
do O
what O
pleases O
him O
. O

So O
he O
has O
not O
left O
me O
alone O
. O
'' O

While O
he O
was O
saying O
these O
things O
, O
many O
people O
believed O
in O
him O
. O

So O
Jesus O
said O
to O
the O
Jews O
who O
believed O
in O
him O
, O
`` O
If O
you O
continue O
to O
accept O
and O
obey O
my O
teaching O
, O
you O
are O
really O
my O
followers O
. O

You O
will O
know O
the O
truth O
, O
and O
the O
truth O
will O
make O
you O
free O
. O
'' O

They O
answered O
, O
`` O
We O
are O
Abraham O
's O
descendants O
. O

And O
we O
have O
never O
been O
slaves O
. O

So O
why O
do O
you O
say O
that O
we O
will O
be O
free O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
truth O
is O
, O
everyone O
who O
sins O
is O
a O
slave O
-- O
a O
slave O
to O
sin O
. O

A O
slave O
does O
not O
stay O
with O
a O
family O
forever O
. O

But O
a O
son O
belongs O
to O
the O
family O
forever O
. O

So O
if O
the O
Son O
makes O
you O
free O
, O
you O
are O
really O
free O
. O

I O
know O
you O
are O
Abraham O
's O
descendants O
. O

But O
you O
want O
to O
kill O
me O
, O
because O
you O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
accept O
my O
teaching O
. O

I O
am O
telling O
you O
what O
my O
Father O
has O
shown O
me O
. O

But O
you O
do O
what O
your O
father O
has O
told O
you O
. O
'' O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Our O
father O
is O

'' O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
If O
you O
were O
really O
Abraham O

you O
would O
do O

I O
am O
someone O
who O

But O
you O
are O
trying O

kill O
me O

Abraham O
did O
nothing O

So O
you O
are O
doing O
what O
your O
own O

did O

'' O

But O
they O
said O

`` O
We O

Jesus O

to O
them O

`` O
If O
God O

now O
I O
am O
here O

I O
did O
not O
come O
by O
my O
own O
authority O

God O
sent O
me O
. O

You O
do O
n't O
understand O
the O
things O
I O
say O
, O
because O
you O
can O
not O
accept O
my O
teaching O
. O

Your O
father O
is O
the O
devil O
. O

You O
belong O
to O
him O
. O

You O
want O
to O
do O
what O
he O
wants O

He O
was O
a O
murderer O
from O
the O
beginning O

He O
was O
always O
against O
the O
truth O

There O
is O
no O

He O
is O
like O
the O

he O
tells O

, O
the O

is O
a O

He O
is O
the O

`` O
I O
am O
telling O
you O
the O

that O
's O
why O

Can O
any O
of O
you O
prove O
that O
I O
am O
guilty O
of O
sin O

If O
I O
tell O
the O
truth O

why O
do O
n't O
you O
believe O
me O

Whoever O
belongs O
to O
God O
accepts O
what O
he O
says O

But O
you O
do O
n't O
accept O
what O
God O

you O

The O
Jews O
there O
answered O
, O
`` O
We O
say O
you O
are O
a O
Samaritan O

We O
say O
a O

Are O

not O
right O
when O
we O

this O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
have O
no O
demon O
in O

I O
give O
honor O
to O
my O

no O

I O

There O
is O
one O

this O

He O

I O
promise O
you O

whoever O
continues O

The O
Jews O
said O
to O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
Now O
we O
know O
that O
you O
have O
a O
demon O
in O
you O

Even O
Abraham O

died O

But O
you O
say O
, O
' O
Whoever O
obeys O

never O

Do O
you O
think O
you O

greater O

our O

He O
died O

and O
so O
did O
the O

Who O
do O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
If O
I O

, O
that O
honor O
is O
worth O
nothing O

The O
one O
who O
gives O

is O
my O
Father O

And O
you O
say O
that O
he O

you O
do O

I O

If O
I O
said O
I O
did O
not O

I O
would O
be O
a O

But O
I O
do O
know O
him O
, O
and O
I O
obey O
what O
he O
says O

Your O
father O
Abraham O
was O
very O
happy O
that O
he O
would O
see O
the O
day O
when O
I O
came O

He O
saw O
that O
day O

was O
happy O

The O
Jews O
said O
to O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
What O
? O

How O
can O
you O
say O
you O
have O
seen O
Abraham O
? O

You O
are O
not O
even O
50 O
years O
old O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
The O
fact O
is O
, O
before O
Abraham O
was O
born O
, O
I O
AM O

When O
he O
said O
this O
, O
they O
picked O
up O
stones O
to O
throw O
at O
him O
. O

But O
Jesus O
hid O
, O
and O
then O
he O
left O
the O
Temple O
area O
. O

When O
Jesus O
finished O
praying O
, O
he O
left O
with O
his O
followers O
and O
went O
across O
the O
Kidron O
Valley O
. O

He O
went O
into O
a O
garden O
there O
, O
his O
followers O
still O
with O
him O
. O

Judas O
, O
the O
one O
responsible O
for O
handing O
Jesus O
over O
, O
knew O
where O
this O
place O
was O
. O

He O
knew O
because O
Jesus O
often O
met O
there O
with O
his O
followers O
. O

So O
Judas O
led O
a O
group O
of O
soldiers O
to O
the O
garden O
, O
along O
with O
some O
guards O
from O
the O
leading O
priests O
and O
the O
Pharisees O
. O

They O
were O
carrying O
torches O

lanterns O
, O
and O
weapons O
. O

Jesus O
already O
knew O
everything O
that O
would O
happen O
to O
him O
. O

So O
he O
went O
out O
and O
asked O
them O
, O
`` O
Who O
are O
you O
looking O
for O
? O
'' O

They O
answered O
, O
`` O
Jesus O
from O
Nazareth O

He O
said O

`` O
I O

Judas O

the O
one O
responsible O

When O
Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
am O

, O
'' O
the O
men O
moved O
back O
and O
fell O
to O
the O
ground O

He O
asked O
them O
again O
, O
`` O
Who O
are O
you O
looking O
for O
? O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Jesus O
from O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
told O
you O
that O

So O
if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
me O
, O
let O
these O

men O
go O
free O

This O
was O
to O
show O
the O
truth O
of O
what O
Jesus O
said O
earlier O
: O

`` O
I O
have O
not O
lost O
anyone O
you O
gave O
me O

'' O

Simon O
Peter O
had O
a O
sword O
, O
which O
he O
pulled O
out O
. O

He O
struck O
the O
servant O
of O
the O
high O
priest O
and O
cut O
off O
his O
right O
ear O

-LRB- O
The O
servant O
's O
name O
was O
Malchus O

Jesus O
said O
to O
Peter O
, O
`` O
Put O
your O
sword O
back O

its O
place O

I O
must O
drink O
from O
the O
cup O

Father O
has O
given O
me O

'' O

Then O
the O
soldiers O
with O
their O
commander O
and O
the O
Jewish O
guards O
arrested O
Jesus O
. O

They O
tied O
him O
and O
brought O
him O
to O
Annas O
, O
the O
father O
- O

in O
- O
law O
of O
Caiaphas O
. O

Caiaphas O
was O
the O
high O
priest O
that O
year O
. O

He O
was O
also O
the O
one O
who O
had O
told O
the O
other O
Jewish O
leaders O
that O
it O
would O
be O
better O
if O
one O
man O
died O
for O
all O
the O
people O
. O

Simon O
Peter O
and O
another O
one O
of O
Jesus O
' O
followers O
went O
with O
Jesus O
. O

This O
follower O
knew O
the O
high O
priest O
. O

So O
he O
went O
with O
Jesus O
into O
the O
yard O
of O
the O
high O
priest O
's O
house O
. O

But O
Peter O
waited O
outside O
near O
the O
door O
. O

The O
follower O
who O
knew O
the O
high O
priest O
came O
back O
outside O
and O
spoke O
to O
the O
gatekeeper O
. O

Then O
he O
brought O
Peter O
inside O
. O

The O
girl O
at O
the O
gate O
said O
to O
Peter O
, O
`` O
Are O
you O
also O
one O
of O
the O
followers O
of O
that O
man O
? O
'' O

Peter O
answered O
, O
`` O
No O
, O
I O
am O
not O
! O
'' O

It O
was O
cold O
, O
so O
the O
servants O
and O
guards O
had O
built O
a O
fire O
. O

They O
were O
standing O
around O
it O
, O
warming O
themselves O
, O
and O
Peter O
was O
standing O
with O
them O
. O

The O
high O
priest O
asked O
Jesus O
questions O
about O
his O
followers O
and O
what O
he O
taught O
them O
. O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
have O
always O
spoken O
openly O
to O
all O
people O

I O
always O
taught O
in O
the O
synagogues O

in O
the O
Temple O
area O
. O

All O
the O
Jews O
come O
together O
there O
. O

I O
never O
said O
anything O
in O
secret O
. O

So O
why O
do O
you O
question O
me O
? O

Ask O
the O
people O
who O
heard O
my O
teaching O
. O

They O
know O
what O
I O
said O
. O
'' O
When O
Jesus O
said O
this O
, O
one O
of O
the O
guards O
standing O
there O
hit O
him O
. O

The O
guard O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
should O
not O
talk O
to O
the O
high O
priest O
like O
that O
! O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
If O
I O
said O
something O
wrong O
, O
tell O
everyone O
here O
what O
was O
wrong O

But O
if O
what O
I O
said O
is O
right O

then O
why O
do O
you O
hit O
me O
? O
'' O

So O
Annas O
sent O
Jesus O
to O
Caiaphas O
the O
high O
priest O
. O

He O
was O
still O
tied O
. O

Simon O
Peter O
was O
standing O
at O
the O
fire O
, O
keeping O
himself O
warm O
. O

The O
other O
people O
said O
to O
Peter O
, O
`` O
Are O
n't O
you O
one O
of O
the O
followers O
of O
that O
man O

'' O

Peter O
denied O
it O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
No O
, O
I O
am O
not O
. O
'' O

One O
of O
the O
servants O
of O
the O
high O
priest O
was O
there O
. O

He O
was O
a O
relative O
of O
the O
man O
whose O
ear O
Peter O
had O
cut O
off O
. O

The O
servant O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
think O
I O
saw O
you O
with O
him O
in O
the O
garden O

'' O

But O
again O
Peter O
said O
, O
`` O
No O
, O
I O
was O
not O
with O
him O

As O
soon O
as O
he O
said O
this O
, O
a O
rooster O
crowed O

Then O
the O
guards O
took O
Jesus O
from O
Caiaphas O
' O
house O
to O
the O
Roman O
governor O
's O
palace O
. O

It O
was O
early O
in O
the O
morning O
. O

The O
Jews O
there O
would O
not O
go O
inside O
the O
palace O
. O

They O
did O
not O
want O
to O
make O
themselves O
unclean O
, O
because O
they O
wanted O
to O
eat O
the O
Passover O
meal O
. O

So O
Pilate O
went O
outside O
to O
them O
and O
asked O
, O
`` O
What O
do O
you O
say O
this O
man O
has O
done O
wrong O
? O
'' O

They O
answered O
, O
`` O
He O
is O
a O
bad O
man O
. O

That O
is O
why O
we O
brought O
him O
to O
you O
. O
'' O

Pilate O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
You O
take O
him O
yourselves O
and O
judge O
him O
by O
your O
own O
law O
. O
'' O

The O
Jewish O
leaders O
answered O
, O
`` O
But O
your O
law O
does O
not O
allow O
us O
to O
punish O
anyone O
by O
killing O
them O

-LRB- O
This O
was O
to O
show O
the O
truth O
of O
what O
Jesus O
said O
about O
how O
he O
would O
die O

-RRB- O

Then O
Pilate O
went O
back O
inside O
the O
palace O

He O
called O
for O
Jesus O
and O
asked O
him O
, O
`` O
Are O
you O
the O
king O
of O
the O
Jews O

Jesus O
said O

`` O
Is O
that O
your O

question O

did O

people O
tell O
you O
about O

Pilate O
said O
, O
`` O
I O

not O

It O
was O
your O

their O

brought O

What O

Jesus O
said O

`` O
My O

If O

No O

my O

Pilate O
said O
, O
`` O
So O
you O
are O
a O
king O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
You O
are O
right O
to O
say O
that O

I O
was O

Pilate O
said O

`` O

Then O
he O
went O
out O
to O
the O
Jewish O
leaders O
again O
and O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
I O
can O
find O
nothing O

`` O

-LRB- O
Barabbas O

Later O
, O
Jesus O
went O
to O
Jerusalem O
for O
a O
special O
Jewish O
festival O
. O

In O
Jerusalem O
there O
is O
a O
pool O
with O
five O
covered O
porches O
. O

In O
Aramaic O
it O
is O
called O
Bethzatha O
. O

This O
pool O
is O
near O
the O
Sheep O
Gate O
. O

Many O
sick O
people O
were O
lying O
on O
the O
porches O
beside O
the O
pool O
. O

Some O
of O
them O
were O
blind O
, O
some O
were O
crippled O
, O
and O
some O
were O
paralyzed O
. O

One O
of O
the O
men O
lying O
there O
had O
been O
sick O
for O
38 O
years O
. O

Jesus O
saw O
him O
lying O
there O
and O
knew O
that O
he O
had O
been O
sick O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time O
. O

So O
he O
asked O
him O
, O
`` O
Do O
you O
want O
to O
be O
well O
? O
'' O

The O
sick O
man O
answered O
, O
`` O
Sir O
, O
there O
is O
no O
one O
to O
help O
me O
get O
into O
the O
water O
when O
it O
starts O
moving O
. O

I O
try O
to O
be O
the O
first O
one O
into O
the O
water O
. O

But O
when O
I O
try O
, O
someone O
else O
always O
goes O
in O
before O
I O
can O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Stand O
up O
! O

Pick O
up O
your O
mat O
and O
walk O

'' O

Immediately O
the O
man O
was O
well O
. O

He O
picked O
up O
his O
mat O
and O
started O
walking O
. O

The O
day O
all O
this O
happened O
was O
a O
Sabbath O
day O

So O
some O
Jews O
said O
to O
the O
man O
who O
had O
been O
healed O
, O
`` O

Today O
is O
the O
Sabbath O

It O
is O
against O
our O
law O
for O
you O
to O
carry O
your O

on O
the O
Sabbath O

But O
he O
answered O
, O
`` O
The O

made O
me O
well O

They O
asked O

But O
the O

were O
many O
people O
there O
, O
and O
Jesus O
had O
left O
. O

Later O
, O
Jesus O
found O
the O
man O
at O
the O
Temple O
and O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
See O
, O
you O
are O
well O
now O
. O

But O
stop O
sinning O
or O
something O
worse O
may O
happen O
to O
you O
! O
'' O

Then O
the O
man O
left O
and O
went O
back O
to O
the O
Jews O
who O
questioned O
him O
. O

He O
told O
them O
that O
Jesus O
was O
the O
one O
who O
made O
him O
well O
. O

Jesus O
was O
doing O
all O
this O
on O
the O
Sabbath O
day O
. O

So O
these O
Jews O
began O
trying O
to O
make O
him O
stop O
. O

But O
he O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
My O
Father O
never O
stops O
working O
, O
and O
so O
I O
work O
too O
. O
'' O

This O
made O
them O
try O
harder O
to O
kill O
him O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
First O
this O
man O
was O
breaking O
the O
law O
about O
the O
Sabbath O
day O
. O

Then O
he O
said O
that O
God O
is O
his O
Father O
! O

He O
is O
making O
himself O
equal O
with O
God O
! O
'' O

But O
Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
assure O
you O
that O
the O
Son O
can O
do O
nothing O
alone O
. O

He O
does O
only O
what O
he O
sees O
his O
Father O
doing O
. O

The O
Son O
does O
the O
same O
things O
that O
the O
Father O
does O
. O

The O
Father O
loves O
the O
Son O
and O
shows O
him O
everything O
he O
does O
. O

This O
man O
was O
healed O
. O

But O
the O
Father O
will O
show O
the O
Son O
greater O
things O
than O
this O
to O
do O
. O

Then O
you O
will O
all O
be O
amazed O
. O

The O
Father O
raises O
the O
dead O
and O
gives O
them O
life O
. O

In O
the O
same O
way O
, O
the O
Son O
gives O
life O
to O
those O
he O
wants O
to O
. O

`` O
Also O
, O
the O
Father O
judges O
no O
one O
. O

He O
has O
given O
the O
Son O
power O
to O
do O
all O
the O
judging O
. O

God O
did O
this O
so O
that O
all O
people O
will O
respect O
the O
Son O
the O
same O
as O
they O
respect O
the O
Father O
. O

Anyone O
who O
does O
not O
respect O
the O
Son O
does O
not O
respect O
the O
Father O
. O

He O
is O
the O
one O
who O
sent O
the O
Son O
. O

`` O
I O
assure O
you O
, O
anyone O
who O
hears O
what O
I O
say O
and O
believes O
in O
the O
one O
who O
sent O
me O
has O
eternal O
life O
. O

They O
will O
not O
be O
judged O
guilty O
. O

They O
have O
already O
left O
death O
and O
have O
entered O
into O
life O
. O

Believe O
me O
, O
an O
important O
time O
is O
coming O
. O

That O
time O
is O
already O
here O
. O

People O
who O
are O
dead O
will O
hear O
the O
voice O
of O
the O
Son O
of O
God O
. O

And O
those O
who O
listen O
will O
live O
. O

Life O
comes O
from O
the O
Father O
himself O
. O

So O
the O
Father O
has O
also O
allowed O
the O
Son O
to O
give O
life O
. O

And O
the O
Father O
has O
given O
him O
the O
power O
to O
judge O
all O
people O
because O
he O
is O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O
. O

`` O
Do O
n't O
be O
surprised O
at O
this O

A O
time O
is O
coming O
when O
all O
people O
who O
are O
dead O
and O
in O
their O
graves O
will O
hear O
his O
voice O
. O

Then O
they O
will O
come O
out O
of O
their O
graves O
. O

Those O
who O
did O
good O
in O
this O
life O
will O
rise O
and O
have O
eternal O
life O
. O

But O
those O
who O
did O
evil O
will O
rise O
to O
be O
judged O
guilty O
. O

`` O
I O
can O
do O
nothing O
alone O
. O

I O
judge O
only O
the O
way O
I O
am O
told O
. O

And O
my O
judgment O
is O
right O
, O
because O
I O
am O
not O
trying O
to O
please O
myself O
. O

I O
want O
only O
to O
please O
the O
one O
who O

`` O
If O
I O

not O

sure O
that O

But O
there O
is O
someone O
else O
who O
tells O
people O
about O

and O
I O
know O
that O
what O
he O

`` O
You O

I O
do O

anyone O

but O
I O
remind O
you O
of O
what O
John O

so O
that O
you O

John O
was O
like O
a O
lamp O
that O
burned O
and O
gave O
light O

you O
were O
happy O
to O
enjoy O
his O

things O
I O

my O

These O
are O
what O
my O
Father O
gave O
me O
to O

that O

And O
the O
Father O

has O
given O
proof O
about O

But O
you O
have O
never O
heard O
his O
voice O

You O
have O
never O
seen O
what O
he O
looks O
like O
. O

The O
Father O
's O
teaching O
does O
not O
live O
in O
you O
, O
because O
you O
do O
n't O
believe O
in O
the O
one O
the O
Father O
sent O

You O
carefully O
study O
the O
Scriptures O
. O

You O
think O
that O
they O
give O
you O
eternal O
life O

These O
same O
Scriptures O
tell O
about O
me O
! O

But O
you O
refuse O
to O
come O
to O
me O
to O
have O
that O
life O

`` O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
praise O

you O

any O
other O
human O

But O
I O
know O
you O

I O
know O
that O
you O

I O
have O

my O

you O

But O
when O
other O

come O
speaking O
only O
for O
themselves O

you O
accept O
them O

You O
like O

But O
you O
never O
try O
to O
get O
the O
praise O
that O
comes O

So O
how O
can O
you O
believe O

Do O
n't O
think O
that O
I O
will O
be O
the O
one O
to O
stand O
before O

Moses O

the O
one O

he O

If O
you O
really O

Moses O
, O
you O
would O
believe O

because O
he O
wrote O
about O

But O
you O
do O
n't O
believe O

you O

I O

'' O

There O
was O
a O
man O
named O
Lazarus O
who O
was O
sick O
. O

He O
lived O
in O
the O
town O
of O
Bethany O
, O
where O
Mary O
and O
her O
sister O
Martha O
lived O
. O

-LRB- O
Mary O
is O
the O
same O
woman O
who O
put O
perfume O
on O
the O
Lord O
and O
wiped O
his O
feet O
with O
her O
hair O
. O
-RRB- O

Mary O
's O
brother O
was O
Lazarus O
, O
the O
man O
who O
was O
now O
sick O
. O

So O
Mary O
and O
Martha O
sent O
someone O
to O
tell O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
your O
dear O
friend O
Lazarus O
is O
sick O
. O
'' O

When O
Jesus O
heard O
this O
he O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
end O
of O
this O
sickness O
will O
not O
be O
death O
. O

No O
, O
this O
sickness O
is O
for O
the O
glory O
of O
God O
. O

This O
has O
happened O
to O
bring O
glory O
to O
the O
Son O
of O
God O

'' O

Jesus O
loved O
Martha O
and O
her O
sister O
and O
Lazarus O
. O

So O
when O
he O
heard O
that O
Lazarus O
was O
sick O
, O
he O
stayed O
where O
he O
was O
two O
more O
days O
and O
then O
said O
to O
his O
followers O
, O
`` O
We O
should O
go O
back O
to O
Judea O
. O
'' O

They O
answered O
, O
`` O
But O
Teacher O
, O
those O
Jews O
there O
tried O
to O
stone O
you O
to O
death O
. O

That O
was O
only O
a O
short O
time O
ago O
. O

Now O
you O
want O
to O
go O
back O
there O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
There O
are O
twelve O
hours O
of O
light O
in O
the O
day O
. O

Whoever O
walks O
in O
the O
day O
will O
not O
stumble O
and O
fall O
because O
they O
can O
see O
with O
the O
light O
from O
the O
sun O
. O

But O
whoever O
walks O
at O
night O
will O
stumble O
because O
there O
is O
no O
light O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Our O
friend O
Lazarus O
is O
now O
sleeping O
, O
but O
I O
am O
going O
there O
to O
wake O
him O
. O
'' O

The O
followers O
answered O
, O
`` O
But O
, O
Lord O
, O
if O
he O
can O
sleep O
, O
he O
will O
get O
well O
. O
'' O

They O
thought O
Jesus O
meant O
that O
Lazarus O
was O
literally O
sleeping O
, O
but O
he O
really O
meant O
that O
Lazarus O
was O
dead O
. O

So O
then O
Jesus O
said O
plainly O
, O
`` O
Lazarus O
is O
dead O
. O

And O
I O
am O
glad O
I O
was O
not O
there O
. O

I O
am O
happy O
for O
you O
because O
now O
you O
will O
believe O
in O
me O
. O

We O
will O
go O
to O
him O
now O
. O
'' O

Then O
Thomas O
, O
the O
one O
called O
`` O
Twin O
, O
'' O
said O
to O
the O
other O
followers O
, O
`` O
We O
will O
go O
too O
. O

We O
will O
die O
there O
with O
Jesus O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
arrived O
in O
Bethany O
and O
found O
that O
Lazarus O
had O
already O
been O
dead O
and O
in O
the O
tomb O
for O
four O
days O
. O

Bethany O
was O
about O
two O
miles O
from O
Jerusalem O
. O

Many O
Jews O
had O
come O
to O
see O
Martha O
and O
Mary O
. O

They O
came O
to O
comfort O
them O
about O
their O
brother O
Lazarus O
. O

When O
Martha O
heard O
that O
Jesus O
was O
coming O
, O
she O
went O
out O
to O
greet O
him O
. O

But O
Mary O
stayed O
home O
. O

Martha O
said O
to O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
if O
you O
had O
been O
here O
, O
my O
brother O
would O
not O

But O
I O
know O
that O
even O
now O
God O
will O
give O
you O
anything O
you O
ask O

'' O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Your O
brother O
will O
rise O
and O
be O
alive O
again O

'' O

Martha O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
know O
that O
he O
will O
rise O
to O
live O
again O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
resurrection O
on O
the O
last O
day O

'' O

Jesus O
said O
to O
her O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
the O
resurrection O

I O
am O
life O

Everyone O
who O
believes O
in O
me O

have O
life O

even O
if O
they O
die O

And O
everyone O
who O
lives O
and O
believes O
in O
me O
will O
never O
really O
die O
. O

Martha O
, O
do O
you O
believe O
this O
? O
'' O

Martha O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
Lord O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
you O
are O
the O
Christ O
, O
the O
Son O
of O
God O
. O

You O
are O
the O
one O
who O
was O
coming O
to O
the O
world O
. O
'' O

After O
Martha O
said O
these O
things O
, O
she O
went O
back O
to O
her O
sister O
Mary O
. O

She O
talked O
to O
Mary O
alone O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
Teacher O
is O
here O
. O

He O
is O
asking O
for O
you O

'' O

When O
Mary O
heard O
this O
, O
she O
stood O
up O
and O
went O
quickly O
to O
Jesus O
. O

He O
had O
not O
yet O
come O
into O
the O
village O
. O

He O
was O
still O
at O
the O
place O
where O
Martha O
met O
him O
. O

The O
Jews O
who O
were O
in O
the O
house O
comforting O
Mary O
saw O
her O
get O
up O
and O
leave O
quickly O
. O

They O
thought O
she O
was O
going O
to O
the O
tomb O
to O
cry O
there O
. O

So O
they O
followed O
her O
. O

Mary O
went O
to O
the O
place O
where O
Jesus O
was O
. O

When O
she O
saw O
him O
, O
she O
bowed O
at O
his O
feet O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
if O
you O
had O
been O
here O
, O
my O
brother O
would O
not O
have O
died O
. O
'' O

When O
Jesus O
saw O
Mary O
crying O
and O
the O
people O
with O
her O
crying O
too O
, O
he O
was O
very O
upset O
and O
deeply O
troubled O
. O

He O
asked O
, O
`` O
Where O
did O
you O
put O
him O
? O
'' O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
come O
and O
see O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
cried O
. O

And O
the O
Jews O
said O
, O
`` O
Look O
! O

He O
loved O
Lazarus O
very O
much O
! O
'' O

But O
some O
of O
them O
said O
, O
`` O
Jesus O
healed O
the O
eyes O
of O
the O
blind O
man O
. O

Why O
did O
n't O
he O
help O
Lazarus O
and O
stop O
him O
from O
dying O
? O
'' O

Again O
feeling O
very O
upset O
, O
Jesus O
came O
to O
the O
tomb O
. O

It O
was O
a O
cave O
with O
a O
large O
stone O
covering O
the O
entrance O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Move O
the O
stone O
away O
. O
'' O

Martha O
said O
, O
`` O
But O
, O
Lord O
, O
it O
has O
been O
four O
days O
since O
Lazarus O
died O
. O

There O
will O
be O
a O
bad O
smell O
. O
'' O

Martha O
was O
the O
sister O
of O
the O
dead O
man O
. O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
to O
her O
, O
`` O
Remember O
what O
I O
told O
you O
? O

I O
said O
that O
if O
you O
believed O
, O
you O
would O
see O
God O
's O
divine O
greatness O

'' O

So O
they O
moved O
the O
stone O
away O
from O
the O
entrance O
. O

Then O
Jesus O
looked O
up O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Father O
, O
I O
thank O
you O
that O
you O
heard O
me O
. O

I O
know O
that O
you O
always O
hear O
me O

But O
I O
said O
these O
things O
because O
of O
the O
people O
here O
around O
me O
. O

I O
want O
them O
to O
believe O
that O
you O
sent O
me O
. O
'' O

After O
Jesus O
said O
this O
he O
called O
in O
a O
loud O
voice O
, O
`` O
Lazarus O
, O
come O
out O
! O
'' O

The O
dead O
man O
came O
out O
. O

His O
hands O
and O
feet O
were O
wrapped O
with O
pieces O
of O
cloth O
. O

He O
had O
a O
handkerchief O
covering O
his O
face O
. O

Jesus O
said O
to O
the O
people O
, O
`` O
Take O
off O
the O
cloth O
and O
let O
him O
go O
. O
'' O

There O
were O
many O
Jews O
who O
came O
to O
visit O
Mary O
. O

When O
they O
saw O
what O
Jesus O
did O
, O
many O
of O
them O
believed O
in O
him O
. O

But O
some O
of O
them O
went O
to O
the O
Pharisees O
and O
told O
them O
what O
Jesus O
did O
. O

Then O
the O
leading O
priests O
and O
Pharisees O
called O
a O
meeting O
of O
the O
high O
council O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
What O
should O
we O
do O
? O

This O
man O
is O
doing O
many O
miraculous O
signs O
. O

If O
we O
let O
him O
continue O
doing O
these O
things O
, O
everyone O
will O
believe O
in O
him O
. O

Then O
the O
Romans O
will O
come O
and O
take O
away O
our O
Temple O
and O
our O
nation O
. O
'' O

One O
of O
the O
men O
there O
was O
Caiaphas O
. O

He O
was O
the O
high O
priest O
that O
year O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
people O
know O
nothing O
! O

It O
is O
better O
for O
one O
man O
to O
die O
for O
the O
people O
than O
for O
the O
whole O
nation O
to O
be O
destroyed O
. O

But O
you O
do O
n't O
realize O
this O
. O
'' O

Caiaphas O
did O
not O
think O
of O
this O
himself O
. O

As O
that O
year O
's O
high O
priest O
, O
he O
was O
really O
prophesying O
that O
Jesus O
would O
die O
for O
the O
Jewish O
people O
. O

Yes O
, O
he O
would O
die O
for O
the O
Jewish O
people O
. O

But O
he O
would O
also O
die O
for O
God O
's O
other O
children O
scattered O
all O
over O
the O
world O
. O

He O
would O
die O
to O
bring O
them O
all O
together O
and O
make O
them O
one O
people O
. O

That O
day O
the O
Jewish O
leaders O
began O
planning O
to O
kill O
Jesus O
. O

So O
Jesus O
stopped O
traveling O
around O
openly O
among O
the O
Jews O
. O

He O
went O
away O
to O
a O
town O
called O
Ephraim O
in O
an O
area O
near O
the O
desert O
. O

He O
stayed O
there O
with O
his O
followers O
. O

It O
was O
almost O
time O
for O
the O
Jewish O
Passover O
festival O
. O

Many O
people O
from O
the O
country O
went O
to O
Jerusalem O
before O
the O
Passover O
. O

They O
went O
to O
do O
the O
special O
things O
to O
make O
themselves O
pure O
for O
the O
festival O
. O

The O
people O
looked O
for O
Jesus O
. O

They O
stood O
in O
the O
Temple O
area O
and O
asked O
each O
other O
, O
`` O
Is O
he O
coming O
to O
the O
festival O
? O

What O
do O
you O
think O
? O
'' O

But O
the O
leading O
priests O
and O
the O
Pharisees O
had O
given O
a O
special O
order O
about O
Jesus O
. O

They O
said O
that O
anyone O
who O
knew O
where O
he O
was O
must O
tell O
them O
so O
that O
they O
could O
arrest O
him O
. O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
the O
true O
vine O
, O
and O
my O
Father O
is O
the O
gardener O
. O

He O
cuts O
off O
every O
branch O
of O
mine O
that O
does O
not O
produce O
fruit O
. O

He O
also O
trims O
every O
branch O
that O
produces O
fruit O
to O
prepare O
it O
to O
produce O
even O
more O

You O
have O

the O

me O
and O
I O
will O
stay O
joined O
to O
you O

No O
branch O
can O
produce O
fruit O
alone O

It O
must O
stay O
connected O
to O
the O
vine O

It O
is O
the O
same O
with O
you O

You O
can O
not O

You O

`` O
I O

you O

I O
to O
you O

you O
will O
produce O
plenty O
of O
fruit O

But O
separated O
from O
me O
you O
wo O
n't O
be O
able O
to O
do O
anything O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
stay O
joined O
to O
me O
, O
you O
will O
be O
like O
a O
branch O
that O
has O
been O
thrown O
out O
and O
has O
dried O
up O
. O

All O
the O
dead O
branches O
like O
that O
are O
gathered O
up O
, O
thrown O
into O
the O
fire O
and O
burned O

Stay O
joined O
together O
with O
me O
, O
and O
follow O
my O
teachings O

If O
you O
do O
this O
, O
you O
can O
ask O
for O
anything O
you O
want O

and O
it O
will O
be O
given O
to O
you O
. O

Show O
that O
you O
are O
my O
followers O
by O
producing O
much O
fruit O

This O
will O
bring O
honor O
to O
my O
Father O

`` O
I O
have O
loved O
you O

the O
Father O

loved O

Now O
continue O
in O
my O

I O
have O
obeyed O
my O
Father O

commands O

and O
he O
continues O
to O

In O
the O

way O
, O
if O
you O
obey O
my O
commands O
, O
I O
will O
continue O
to O
love O
you O

I O
have O
told O
you O
these O
things O
so O
that O
you O
can O
have O
the O
true O
happiness O
that O
I O
have O

I O
want O
you O
to O
be O

This O
is O
what O
I O
command O
you O
: O
Love O
each O

as O
I O
have O
loved O
you O
. O

The O
greatest O
love O
people O
can O
show O
is O
to O
die O
for O
their O
friends O

You O
are O
my O

you O
do O
what O
I O
tell O
you O
to O
do O

I O
no O
longer O
call O
you O
servants O
, O
because O
servants O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
their O
master O
is O
doing O
. O

But O
now O
I O
call O
you O
friends O
, O
because O
I O
have O
told O
you O
everything O
that O
my O
Father O
told O
me O
. O

`` O
You O
did O
not O
choose O
me O
. O

I O
chose O
you O
. O

And O
I O
gave O
you O
this O
work O
: O
to O
go O
and O
produce O
fruit O
-- O
fruit O
that O
will O
last O
. O

Then O
the O
Father O
will O
give O
you O
anything O
you O
ask O
for O
in O
my O
name O
. O

This O
is O
my O
command O
: O
Love O
each O
other O
. O

`` O
If O
the O
world O
hates O
you O
, O
remember O
that O
they O
hated O
me O
first O
. O

If O
you O
belonged O
to O
the O
world O
, O
the O
world O
would O
love O
you O
as O
it O
loves O
its O
own O
people O
. O

But O
I O
have O
chosen O
you O
to O
be O
different O
from O
those O
in O
the O
world O
. O

So O
you O
do O
n't O
belong O
to O
the O
world O
, O
and O
that O
is O
why O
the O
world O
hates O
you O
. O

`` O
Remember O
the O
lesson O
I O
told O
you O
: O
Servants O
are O
not O
greater O
than O
their O
master O
. O

If O
people O
treated O
me O
badly O
, O
they O
will O
treat O
you O
badly O
too O
. O

And O
if O
they O
obeyed O
my O
teaching O
, O
they O
will O
obey O
yours O
too O
. O

They O
will O
do O
to O
you O
whatever O
they O
did O
to O
me O
, O
because O
you O
belong O
to O
me O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
know O
the O
one O
who O
sent O
me O
. O

If O
I O
had O
not O
come O
and O
spoken O
to O
the O
people O
of O
the O
world O
, O
they O
would O
not O
be O
guilty O
of O
sin O
. O

But O
now O
I O
have O
spoken O
to O
them O
. O

So O
they O
have O
no O
excuse O
for O
their O
sin O
. O

`` O
Whoever O
hates O
me O
also O
hates O
my O
Father O

I O
did O
things O
among O
the O
people O
of O
the O
world O
that O
no O
one O
else O
has O
ever O
done O
. O

If O
I O
had O
not O
done O
those O
things O
, O
they O
would O
not O
be O
guilty O
of O
sin O
. O

But O
they O
have O
seen O
what O
I O
did O
, O
and O
still O
they O
hate O
me O
and O
my O
Father O
. O

But O
this O
happened O
to O
make O
clear O
the O
full O
meaning O
of O
what O
is O
written O
in O
their O
law O
: O
' O
They O
hated O
me O
for O
no O
reason O

' O

`` O
I O
will O
send O
you O
the O
Helper O
from O
the O
Father O

The O
Helper O
is O
the O
Spirit O
of O
truth O
who O
comes O
from O
the O
Father O
. O

When O
he O
comes O
, O
he O
will O
tell O
about O
me O
. O

And O
you O
will O
tell O
people O
about O
me O
too O
, O
because O
you O
have O
been O
with O
me O
from O
the O
beginning O
. O

After O
Jesus O
said O
these O
things O
, O
he O
looked O
toward O
heaven O
and O
prayed O
, O
`` O
Father O
, O
the O

so O
that O

The O

there O
was O
silence O
in O

for O
about O
half O
an O
hour O

I O
saw O
the O
seven O
angels O

stand O
before O
God O

They O
were O
given O
seven O
trumpets O

Another O
angel O
came O

stood O
at O
the O
altar O

This O
angel O
had O
a O
golden O
holder O
for O
incense O

The O
angel O
was O
given O
much O
incense O

offer O
with O
the O
prayers O

all O
God O

The O
angel O
put O
this O
offering O
on O
the O
golden O
altar O

the O
throne O

The O
smoke O
from O
the O
incense O
went O
up O
from O
the O
angel O

hand O

God O

The O
smoke O
went O
up O
with O
the O
prayers O
of O
God O
's O
people O

Then O
the O
angel O
filled O
the O
incense O
holder O
with O
fire O
from O
the O
altar O
and O
threw O
it O
down O
on O
the O
earth O
. O

Then O
there O
were O
flashes O
of O
lightning O
, O
thunder O
and O
other O
noises O
, O
and O
an O
earthquake O
. O

Then O
the O
seven O
angels O
with O
the O
seven O
trumpets O
prepared O
to O
blow O
their O
trumpets O
. O

The O
first O
angel O
blew O
his O
trumpet O
. O

Then O
hail O
and O
fire O
mixed O
with O
blood O
was O
poured O
down O
on O
the O
earth O

And O
a O
third O
of O
the O
earth O
and O
all O
the O
green O
grass O
and O
a O
third O
of O
the O
trees O
were O
burned O
up O

The O
second O
angel O
blew O
his O
trumpet O

Then O
something O
that O
looked O
like O
a O
big O
mountain O
burning O
with O
fire O
was O
thrown O
into O
the O
sea O

And O
a O
third O
of O
the O
sea O
became O
blood O

And O
a O
third O

the O
created O

in O
the O

a O
third O

The O
third O
angel O
blew O
his O

Then O
a O
large O
star O
, O
burning O
like O
a O
torch O
, O
fell O
from O
the O
sky O

It O
fell O
on O
a O
third O
of O
the O
rivers O

on O
the O
springs O
of O
water O

The O
name O
of O
the O
star O
was O
Bitterness O

And O
a O
third O
of O
all O
the O
water O
became O
bitter O

Many O
people O
died O
from O
drinking O
this O
bitter O
water O

The O
fourth O
angel O
blew O
his O
trumpet O

Then O
a O
third O
of O
the O
sun O
and O
a O
third O
of O
the O
moon O

a O
third O

the O
stars O

struck O

So O
a O
third O
of O
them O
became O
dark O

A O
third O
of O
the O
day O
and O
night O
was O
without O
light O

While O
I O
watched O
, O
I O
heard O
an O
eagle O
that O
was O
flying O
high O
in O
the O
air O

The O
eagle O
said O
in O
a O
loud O
voice O
, O
`` O

Terrible O

How O
terrible O
for O
those O
who O
live O

The O
terrible O
trouble O
will O
begin O
after O
the O
sounds O
of O
the O
trumpets O
that O
the O
other O
three O
angels O
will O
blow O

Then O
I O
looked O
, O
and O
there O
before O
me O
was O
an O
open O
door O
in O
heaven O
. O

And O
I O
heard O
the O
same O
voice O
that O
spoke O
to O
me O
before O
. O

It O
was O
the O
voice O
that O
sounded O
like O
a O
trumpet O
. O

It O
said O
, O
`` O
Come O
up O
here O
, O
and O
I O
will O
show O
you O
what O
must O
happen O
after O
this O

'' O

Immediately O
the O
Spirit O
took O
control O
of O
me O
, O
and O
there O
in O
heaven O
was O
a O
throne O
with O
someone O
sitting O
on O
it O
. O

The O
one O
sitting O
there O
was O
as O
beautiful O
as O
precious O
stones O
, O
like O
jasper O
and O
carnelian O
. O

All O
around O
the O
throne O
was O
a O
rainbow O
with O
clear O
colors O
like O
an O
emerald O
. O

In O
a O
circle O
around O
the O
throne O
were O
24 O
other O
thrones O
with O
24 O
elders O
sitting O
on O
them O
. O

The O
elders O
were O
dressed O
in O
white O
, O
and O
they O
had O
golden O
crowns O
on O
their O
heads O
. O

Lightning O
flashes O
and O
noises O
of O
thunder O
came O
from O
the O
throne O
. O

Before O
the O
throne O
there O
were O
seven O
lamps O
burning O
, O
which O
are O
the O
seven O
Spirits O
of O
God O
. O

Also O
before O
the O
throne O
there O
was O
something O
that O
looked O
like O
a O
sea O
of O
glass O
, O
as O
clear O
as O
crystal O
. O

In O
front O
of O
the O
throne O
and O
on O
each O
side O
of O
it O
there O
were O
four O
living O
beings O
. O

They O
had O
eyes O
all O
over O
them O
, O
in O
front O
and O
in O
back O
. O

The O
first O
living O
being O
was O
like O
a O
lion O
. O

The O
second O
was O
like O
a O
bull O
. O

The O
third O
had O
a O
face O
like O
a O
man O
. O

The O
fourth O
was O
like O
a O
flying O
eagle O
. O

Each O
of O
these O
four O
living O
beings O
had O
six O
wings O
. O

They O
were O
covered O
all O
over O
with O
eyes O
, O
inside O
and O
out O
. O

Day O
and O
night O
they O
never O
stopped O
saying O
, O
`` O
Holy O
, O
holy O
, O
holy O
is O
the O
Lord O
God O
All O

Powerful O

He O
always O

, O
he O

is O
coming O

These O
living O
beings O
were O
giving O
glory O
and O
honor O
and O
thanks O
to O
the O
one O
who O
sits O
on O
the O
throne O
, O
the O
one O
who O
lives O
forever O
and O
ever O

And O
every O
time O
they O
did O
this O
, O
the O
24 O
elders O
bowed O
down O
before O
the O
one O
who O
sits O
on O
the O
throne O
. O

They O
worshiped O
him O
who O
lives O
forever O
and O
ever O
. O

They O
put O
their O
crowns O
down O
before O
the O
throne O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Our O
Lord O

are O
worthy O

You O
made O
all O
things O

Everything O
existed O

was O
made O
because O
you O
wanted O
it O
. O
'' O

Then O
I O
saw O
a O
beast O
coming O
up O
out O
of O
the O
sea O
. O

It O
had O
ten O
horns O
and O
seven O
heads O
. O

There O
was O
a O
crown O
on O
each O
of O
its O
horns O
. O

It O
had O
an O
evil O
name O
written O
on O
each O
head O
. O

This O
beast O
looked O
like O
a O
leopard O
, O
with O
feet O
like O
a O
bear O
's O
feet O
. O

It O
had O
a O
mouth O
like O
a O
lion O
's O
mouth O
. O

The O
dragon O
gave O
the O
beast O
all O
of O
its O
power O
and O
its O
throne O
and O
great O
authority O
. O

One O
of O
the O
heads O
of O
the O
beast O
looked O
as O
if O
it O
had O
been O
wounded O
and O
killed O
, O
but O
the O
death O
wound O
was O
healed O
. O

All O
the O
people O
in O
the O
world O
were O
amazed O
, O
and O
they O
all O
followed O
the O
beast O
. O

People O
worshiped O
the O
dragon O
because O
it O
had O
given O
its O
power O
to O
the O
beast O
, O
and O
they O
also O
worshiped O
the O
beast O
. O

They O
asked O
, O
`` O
Who O
is O
as O
powerful O
as O
the O
beast O
? O

Who O
can O
make O
war O
against O
it O
? O
'' O

The O
beast O
was O
allowed O
to O
boast O
and O
speak O
insults O
against O
God O
. O

It O
was O
allowed O
to O
use O
its O
power O
for O
42 O
months O
. O

The O
beast O
opened O
its O
mouth O
to O
insult O
God O
-- O
to O
insult O
his O
name O
, O
the O
place O
where O
he O
lives O
, O
and O
all O
those O
who O
live O
in O
heaven O

It O
was O
given O
power O
to O
make O
war O
against O
God O
's O
holy O
people O
and O
to O
defeat O
them O
. O

It O
was O
given O
power O
over O
every O
tribe O
, O
race O
of O
people O
, O
language O
, O
and O
nation O
. O

Everyone O
living O
on O
earth O
would O
worship O
the O
beast O
. O

These O
are O
all O
the O
people O
since O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
world O
whose O
names O
are O
not O
written O
in O
the O
Lamb O
's O
book O
of O
life O
. O

The O
Lamb O
is O
the O
one O
who O
was O
killed O
. O

Anyone O
who O
hears O
these O
things O
should O
listen O
to O
this O
: O
Whoever O
is O
to O
be O
a O
prisoner O
, O
will O
be O
a O
prisoner O

Whoever O
is O
to O
be O
killed O
with O
a O
sword O
, O
will O
be O
killed O
with O
a O
sword O
. O

This O
means O
that O
God O

holy O
people O
must O
have O
patience O
and O
faith O

Then O
I O
saw O
another O
beast O
coming O
up O
out O
of O
the O
earth O
. O

He O
had O
two O
horns O
like O
a O
lamb O
, O
but O
he O
talked O
like O
a O
dragon O

This O
beast O
stood O
before O
the O
first O
beast O
and O
used O
the O
same O
power O
the O
first O
beast O
had O
. O

He O
used O
this O
power O
to O
make O
everyone O
living O
on O
the O
earth O
worship O
the O
first O
beast O
. O

The O
first O
beast O
was O
the O
one O
that O
had O
the O
death O
wound O
that O
was O
healed O
. O

The O
second O
beast O
did O
great O
miracles O
. O

He O
even O
made O
fire O
come O
down O
from O
heaven O
to O
earth O
while O
people O
were O
watching O
. O

This O
second O
beast O
fooled O
the O
people O
living O
on O
earth O
by O
using O
the O
miracles O
that O
he O
had O
been O
given O
the O
power O
to O
do O
for O
the O
first O
beast O
. O

He O
ordered O
people O
to O
make O
an O
idol O
to O
honor O
the O
first O
beast O
, O
the O
one O
that O
was O
wounded O
by O
the O
sword O
but O
did O
not O
die O
. O

The O
second O
beast O
was O
given O
power O
to O
give O
life O
to O
the O
idol O
of O
the O
first O
beast O
. O

Then O
the O
idol O
could O
speak O
and O
order O
all O
those O
who O
did O
not O
worship O
it O
to O
be O
killed O
. O

The O
second O
beast O
also O
forced O
all O
people O
, O
small O
and O
great O
, O
rich O
and O
poor O
, O
free O
and O
slave O
, O
to O
have O
a O
mark O
put O
on O
their O
right O
hand O
or O
on O
their O
forehead O
. O

No O
one O
could O
buy O
or O
sell O
without O
this O
mark O
. O

-LRB- O
This O
mark O
is O
the O
name O
of O
the O
beast O
or O
the O
number O
of O
its O
name O
. O
-RRB- O

Anyone O
who O
has O
understanding O
can O
find O
the O
meaning O
of O
the O
beast O
's O
number O
. O

This O
requires O
wisdom O
. O

This O
number O
is O
the O
number O
of O
a O
man O
. O

It O
is O
666 O
. O

Then O
I O
saw O
another O
wonder O
in O
heaven O
. O

It O
was O
great O
and O
amazing O
. O

There O
were O
seven O
angels O
bringing O
seven O
plagues O
. O

These O
are O
the O
last O
plagues O
, O
because O
after O
these O
, O
God O
's O
anger O
is O
finished O
. O

I O
saw O
what O
looked O
like O
a O
sea O
of O
glass O
mixed O
with O
fire O
. O

All O
those O
who O
had O
won O
the O
victory O
over O
the O
beast O
and O
his O
idol O
and O
over O
the O
number O
of O
its O
name O
were O
standing O
by O
the O
sea O
. O

These O
people O
had O
harps O
that O
God O
had O
given O
them O
. O

They O
sang O
the O
song O
of O
Moses O
, O
the O
servant O
of O
God O
, O
and O
the O
song O
of O
the O
Lamb O
: O
`` O

the O

the O

in O

It O
was O

the O

were O

clean O

shining O

They O
wore O
golden O
bands O
tied O
around O
their O

Then O
one O
of O
the O
four O
living O
beings O
gave O
seven O
golden O
bowls O
to O
the O
seven O
angels O
. O

The O
bowls O
were O
filled O
with O
the O
anger O
of O
God O
, O
who O
lives O
forever O

ever O
. O

The O
temple O
was O
filled O
with O
smoke O
from O
the O
glory O

the O
power O
of O
God O
. O

No O
one O
could O
enter O
the O

the O

were O
white O
like O
wool O
-- O
wool O
that O
is O
white O
as O
snow O
. O

His O
eyes O
were O
like O
flames O
of O
fire O
. O

His O
feet O
were O
like O
brass O
that O
glows O
hot O
in O
a O
furnace O
. O

His O
voice O
was O
like O
the O
noise O
of O
flooding O
water O
. O

He O
held O
seven O
stars O
in O
his O
right O
hand O
. O

A O
sharp O
two O
- O
edged O
sword O
came O
out O
of O
his O
mouth O
. O

He O
looked O
like O
the O
sun O
shining O
at O
its O
brightest O
time O
. O

When O
I O
saw O
him O
, O
I O
fell O
down O
at O
his O
feet O
like O
a O
dead O
man O
. O

He O
put O
his O
right O
hand O
on O
me O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
be O
afraid O
! O

I O
am O
the O
First O
and O
the O
Last O
. O

I O
am O
the O
one O

lives O

I O
was O
dead O

look O
, O
I O
am O
alive O
forever O

ever O

And O
I O
hold O
the O
keys O
of O
death O
and O
Hades O

So O
write O
what O
you O
see O
. O

Write O
the O
things O
that O
happen O
now O
and O
the O
things O
that O
will O
happen O
later O

Here O
is O
the O
hidden O
meaning O
of O
the O
seven O
stars O
that O
you O
saw O
in O
my O
right O
hand O
and O
the O
seven O
golden O
lampstands O
that O
you O
saw O
: O
The O
seven O
lampstands O
are O
the O
seven O
churches O
. O

The O
seven O
stars O
are O
the O
angels O
of O
the O
seven O
churches O
. O

The O
angel O
showed O
me O
the O
river O
of O
the O
water O
of O
life O
, O
clear O
as O
crystal O
. O

The O
river O
flows O
from O
the O
throne O
of O
God O
and O
the O
Lamb O
. O

It O
flows O
down O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
street O
of O
the O
city O
. O

The O
tree O
of O
life O
is O
on O
each O
side O
of O
the O
river O
, O
and O
it O
produces O
fruit O
every O
month O
, O
twelve O
times O
a O
year O
. O

The O
leaves O
of O
the O
tree O
are O
for O
healing O
the O
nations O
. O

Nothing O
that O
God O
judges O
guilty O
will O
be O
there O
in O
that O
city O
. O

The O
throne O
of O
God O
and O
the O
Lamb O
will O
be O
in O
the O
city O
. O

God O
's O
servants O
will O
worship O
him O
. O

They O
will O
see O
his O
face O
. O

God O
's O
name O
will O
be O
written O
on O
their O
foreheads O
. O

There O
will O
never O
be O
night O
again O

People O
will O
not O
need O
the O
light O
of O
a O
lamp O
or O
the O
light O
of O
the O
sun O

The O
Lord O
God O
will O
give O
them O
light O

And O
they O
will O
rule O
like O
kings O
forever O
and O
ever O

Then O
the O

said O
to O
me O
, O
`` O

four O

angel O

I O

There O
were O
144 O

I O

bowed O
down O

one O

me O

But O
you O

not O

So O
I O
am O
ready O

spit O
you O
out O

You O

You O
think O
you O

But O
you O
do O

Buy O

the O
Spirit O

'' O

Then O
I O
saw O
a O
scroll O
in O
the O
right O
hand O
of O
the O
one O
sitting O
on O
the O
throne O
. O

The O
scroll O
had O
writing O
on O
both O
sides O
and O
was O
kept O
closed O
with O
seven O
seals O
. O

And O
I O
saw O
a O
powerful O
angel O
, O
who O
called O
in O
a O
loud O
voice O
, O
`` O
Who O
is O
worthy O
to O
break O
the O
seals O
and O
open O
the O

'' O

But O
there O
was O
no O
one O
in O
heaven O
or O
on O
earth O
or O
under O
the O
earth O
who O
could O
open O
the O

look O
inside O
it O

I O
cried O
and O
cried O
because O
there O
was O
no O
one O
who O
was O
worthy O
to O
open O
the O
scroll O
or O
look O
inside O
. O

But O
one O
of O
the O
elders O
said O
to O
me O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
cry O
! O

The O
Lion O
from O
the O
tribe O
of O
Judah O
has O
won O
the O
victory O

He O
is O
David O

descendant O

He O
is O
able O
to O
open O
the O
scroll O
and O
its O
seven O
seals O

'' O

Then O
I O
saw O
a O
Lamb O
standing O
in O
the O
center O
near O
the O
throne O
with O
the O
four O
living O
beings O
around O
it O
. O

The O
elders O
were O
also O
around O
the O
Lamb O
. O

The O
Lamb O
looked O
as O
if O
it O
had O
been O
killed O
. O

It O
had O
seven O
horns O
and O
seven O
eyes O
, O
which O
are O
the O
seven O
spirits O
of O
God O
that O
were O
sent O
into O
all O
the O
world O
. O

The O
Lamb O
came O
and O
took O
the O
scroll O
from O
the O
right O
hand O
of O
the O
one O
sitting O
on O
the O
throne O
. O

After O
the O
Lamb O
took O
the O
scroll O
, O
the O
four O
living O
beings O
and O
the O
24 O
elders O
bowed O
down O
before O
the O
Lamb O
. O

Each O
one O
of O
them O
had O
a O
harp O
. O

Also O
, O
they O
were O
holding O
golden O
bowls O
full O
of O
incense O
, O
which O
are O
the O
prayers O
of O
God O
's O
holy O
people O
. O

And O
they O
all O
sang O
a O
new O
song O
to O
the O
Lamb O
: O
`` O
You O
are O
worthy O
to O
take O
the O
scroll O
and O
to O
open O
its O
seals O
, O
because O
you O
were O
killed O
, O
and O
with O
your O
blood O
sacrifice O
you O
bought O
people O
for O
God O
from O
every O
tribe O
, O
language O
, O
race O
of O
people O
, O
and O
nation O

You O
made O
them O
to O
be O
a O
kingdom O
and O
to O
be O
priests O
for O
our O
God O

And O
they O
will O
rule O
on O
the O
earth O

'' O

Then O
I O
looked O
, O
and O
I O
heard O
the O
voices O
of O
many O
angels O
. O

The O
angels O
were O
around O
the O
throne O
, O
the O
four O
living O
beings O
, O
and O
the O
elders O
. O

There O
were O
thousands O
and O
thousands O
of O
angels O
-- O
10 O
, O
000 O
times O
10 O
, O
000 O

The O
angels O
said O
in O
a O
loud O
voice O
, O
`` O
All O
power O

wealth O
, O
wisdom O
, O
and O
strength O
belong O

killed O
. O

He O
is O
worthy O
to O
receive O
honor O
, O
glory O
, O
and O
praise O

'' O

Then O
I O
heard O
every O
created O
being O
that O
is O
in O
heaven O
and O
on O
earth O
and O
under O
the O
earth O
and O
in O
the O

everything O

`` O

to O

'' O

The O
four O
living O
beings O
said O
, O
`` O
Amen O

'' O

And O
the O
elders O
bowed O
down O
and O
worshiped O
. O

And O
then O
a O
great O
wonder O
appeared O
in O
heaven O
: O

There O
was O
a O
woman O
who O
was O
clothed O
with O
the O
sun O
, O
and O
the O
moon O
was O
under O
her O
feet O
. O

She O
had O
a O
crown O
of O
twelve O
stars O
on O
her O
head O
. O

She O
was O
pregnant O
and O
cried O
out O
with O
pain O
because O
she O
was O
about O
to O
give O
birth O
. O

Then O
another O
wonder O
appeared O
in O
heaven O
: O
There O
was O
a O
giant O
red O
dragon O
there O
. O

The O
dragon O
had O
seven O
heads O
with O
a O
crown O
on O
each O
head O
. O

It O
also O
had O
ten O
horns O
. O

Its O
tail O
swept O
a O
third O
of O
the O
stars O
out O
of O
the O
sky O
and O
threw O
them O
down O
to O
the O
earth O
. O

It O
stood O
in O
front O
of O
the O
woman O
who O
was O
ready O
to O
give O
birth O
to O
the O
baby O
. O

It O
wanted O
to O
eat O
the O
woman O
's O
baby O
as O
soon O
as O
it O
was O
born O
. O

The O
woman O
gave O
birth O
to O
a O
son O
, O
who O
would O
rule O
all O
the O
nations O
with O
an O
iron O
rod O
. O

And O
her O
child O
was O
taken O
up O
to O
God O
and O
to O
his O
throne O
. O

The O
woman O
ran O
away O
into O
the O
desert O
to O
a O
place O
that O
God O
had O
prepared O
for O
her O
. O

There O
she O
would O
be O
taken O
care O
of O
for O
1260 O
days O
. O

Then O
there O
was O
a O
war O
in O
heaven O
. O

Michael O
and O
his O
angels O
fought O
against O
the O
dragon O
. O

The O
dragon O
and O
its O
angels O
fought O
back O
, O
but O
they O
were O
not O
strong O
enough O
. O

The O
dragon O
and O
its O
angels O
lost O
their O
place O
in O
heaven O
. O

It O
was O
thrown O
down O
out O
of O
heaven O
. O

-LRB- O
This O
giant O
dragon O
is O
that O
old O
snake O

the O
one O
called O
the O
devil O

Satan O

who O
leads O
the O
whole O

-RRB- O

The O
dragon O
and O
its O
angels O
were O
thrown O
to O
the O
earth O
. O

Then O
I O
heard O
a O
loud O
voice O
in O
heaven O
say O
, O
`` O
The O
victory O
and O
the O
power O
and O
the O
kingdom O
of O
our O
God O
and O
the O
authority O
of O
his O
Christ O
have O
now O
come O

These O
things O
have O
come O
, O
because O
the O
accuser O
of O
our O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
has O
been O
thrown O
out O
. O

He O
is O
the O
one O
who O
accused O
them O
day O
and O
night O
before O
our O
God O
. O

They O
defeated O
him O
by O
the O
blood O
sacrifice O
of O
the O
Lamb O
and O
by O
the O
message O
of O
God O
that O
they O
told O
people O
. O

They O
did O
not O
love O
their O
lives O
too O
much O
. O

They O
were O
not O
afraid O
of O
death O
. O

So O
rejoice O
, O
you O
heavens O
and O
all O
who O
live O
there O
! O

But O
it O
will O
be O
terrible O
for O
the O
earth O
and O
sea O
, O
because O
the O
devil O
has O
gone O
down O
to O
you O
. O

He O
is O
filled O
with O
anger O
. O

He O
knows O
he O
does O
n't O
have O
much O
time O

'' O

The O
dragon O
saw O
that O
he O
had O
been O
thrown O
down O
to O
the O
earth O
. O

So O
he O
chased O
the O
woman O
who O
had O
given O
birth O
to O
the O
child O
. O

But O
the O
woman O
was O
given O
the O
two O
wings O
of O
a O
great O
eagle O
. O

Then O
she O
could O
fly O
to O
the O
place O
that O
was O
prepared O
for O
her O
in O
the O
desert O
. O

There O
she O
would O
be O
taken O
care O
of O
for O
three O
and O
a O
half O
years O
. O

There O
she O
would O
be O
away O
from O
the O
dragon O
. O

Then O
the O
dragon O
poured O
water O
out O
of O
its O
mouth O
like O
a O
river O
. O

It O
poured O
the O
water O
toward O
the O
woman O
so O
that O
the O
flood O
would O
carry O
her O
away O
. O

But O
the O
earth O
helped O
the O
woman O
. O

The O
earth O
opened O
its O
mouth O
and O
swallowed O
the O
river O
that O
came O
from O
the O
mouth O
of O
the O
dragon O
. O

Then O
the O
dragon O
was O
very O
angry O
with O
the O
woman O
. O

It O
went O
away O
to O
make O
war O
against O
all O
her O
other O
children O
. O

Her O
children O
are O
those O
who O
obey O
God O
's O
commands O
and O
have O
the O
truth O
that O
Jesus O
taught O
. O

The O
dragon O
stood O
on O
the O
seashore O
. O

Then O
I O
watched O
as O
the O
Lamb O
opened O
the O
first O
of O
the O
seven O
seals O
. O

Then O
I O
heard O
one O
of O
the O
four O
living O
beings O
speak O
with O
a O
voice O
like O
thunder O
. O

It O
said O
, O
`` O
Come O
! O

I O
looked O
, O
and O
there O
before O
me O
was O
a O
white O
horse O

The O
rider O
on O
the O
horse O
held O
a O
bow O
and O
was O
given O
a O
crown O

He O
rode O
out O
to O
defeat O
the O
enemy O
and O
win O
the O
victory O

The O
Lamb O
opened O
the O
second O
seal O

Then O
I O
heard O
the O
second O
living O
being O
say O
, O
`` O
Come O
! O

Then O
another O
horse O
came O
out O
, O
a O
red O
one O
. O

The O
rider O
on O
the O
horse O
was O
given O
power O
to O
take O
away O
peace O
from O
the O
earth O
so O
that O
people O
would O
kill O
each O
other O

He O
was O
given O
a O
big O
sword O

The O
Lamb O
opened O
the O
third O
seal O

Then O
I O
heard O
the O
third O
living O

say O
, O
`` O
Come O

I O
looked O

and O
there O
before O
me O
was O
a O
black O
horse O

The O
rider O
on O
the O
horse O
held O
a O
pair O
of O
scales O
in O
his O
hand O
. O

Then O
I O
heard O
something O
that O
sounded O
like O
a O
voice O
. O

The O
voice O
came O
from O
where O
the O
four O
living O
beings O
were O
. O

It O
said O
, O
`` O
A O
quart O
of O
wheat O

three O
quarts O
of O
barley O
will O
cost O
a O
full O

But O
do O
n't O
harm O
the O
supply O
of O
olive O
oil O
and O
wine O

The O
Lamb O
opened O
the O
fourth O
seal O

Then O
I O
heard O
the O
voice O
of O
the O
fourth O
living O
being O
say O
, O
`` O
Come O

I O
looked O
, O
and O
there O
before O
me O
was O
a O
pale O
- O

colored O
horse O

The O
rider O
on O
the O
horse O
was O
death O
, O
and O
Hades O
was O
following O
close O
behind O
him O

They O
were O
given O
power O
over O
a O
fourth O
of O
the O
earth O
-- O
power O
to O
kill O
people O
with O
the O
sword O
, O
by O
starving O
, O
by O
disease O

and O
with O
the O
wild O
animals O
of O
the O
earth O

The O
Lamb O
opened O
the O
fifth O
seal O
. O

Then O
I O
saw O
some O
souls O
under O
the O
altar O
. O

They O
were O
the O
souls O
of O
those O
who O
had O
been O
killed O
because O
they O
were O
faithful O
to O
God O
's O
message O
and O
to O
the O
truth O
they O
had O
received O
. O

These O
souls O
shouted O
in O
a O
loud O
voice O
, O
`` O
Holy O
and O
true O
Lord O

how O
long O
until O
you O
judge O
the O
people O

punish O
them O
for O
killing O
us O

Then O
each O
one O
of O
them O
was O
given O
a O
white O
robe O
. O

They O
were O
told O
to O
wait O
a O
short O
time O
longer O

There O
were O
still O
some O
of O
their O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
in O
the O
service O
of O
Christ O
who O
must O
be O
killed O
as O
they O
were O

These O
souls O
were O
told O
to O
wait O
until O
all O
the O
killing O
was O
finished O

Then O
I O
watched O
while O
the O
Lamb O
opened O
the O
sixth O
seal O
. O

There O
was O
a O
great O
earthquake O
, O
and O
the O
sun O
became O
as O
black O
as O
sackcloth O
. O

The O
full O
moon O
became O
red O
like O
blood O
. O

The O
stars O
in O
the O
sky O
fell O
to O
the O
earth O
like O
a O
fig O
tree O
dropping O
its O
figs O
when O
the O
wind O
blows O
. O

The O
sky O
was O
split O
in O
the O
middle O
and O
both O
sides O
rolled O
up O
like O
a O
scroll O
. O

And O
every O
mountain O
and O
island O
was O
moved O
from O
its O
place O

Then O
all O
the O
people O

the O
rulers O

said O
to O
the O
mountains O

the O
rocks O
, O
`` O

Fall O

us O
from O

throne O

Hide O
us O
from O
the O
anger O
of O
the O
Lamb O

The O
great O
day O
for O
their O
anger O
has O
come O
. O

No O
one O
can O
stand O
against O
it O

'' O

Then O
I O
was O
given O
a O
measuring O
rod O
as O
long O
as O
a O
walking O
stick O
. O

I O
was O
told O
, O
`` O
Go O
and O
measure O
the O
temple O
of O
God O
and O
the O
altar O
, O
and O
count O
the O
people O
worshiping O
there O
. O

But O
do O
n't O
measure O
the O
yard O
outside O
the O
temple O

Leave O
it O
alone O
. O

It O
has O
been O
given O
to O
those O
who O
are O
not O
God O
's O
people O
. O

They O
will O
show O
their O
power O
over O
the O
holy O
city O
for O
42 O
months O
. O

And O
I O
will O
give O
power O
to O
my O
two O
witnesses O
. O

And O
they O
will O
prophesy O
for O
1260 O
days O
. O

They O
will O
be O
dressed O
in O
sackcloth O
. O
'' O

These O
two O
witnesses O
are O
the O
two O
olive O
trees O
and O
the O
two O
lampstands O
that O
stand O
before O
the O
Lord O
of O
the O
earth O
. O

If O
anyone O
tries O
to O
hurt O
the O
witnesses O
, O
fire O
comes O
from O
the O
mouths O
of O
the O
witnesses O
and O
kills O
their O
enemies O
. O

Anyone O
who O
tries O
to O
hurt O
them O
will O
die O
like O
this O
. O

These O
witnesses O
have O
the O
power O
to O
stop O
the O
sky O
from O
raining O
during O
the O
time O
they O
are O
prophesying O
. O

These O
witnesses O
have O
power O
to O
make O
the O
water O
become O
blood O
. O

They O
have O
power O
to O
send O
every O
kind O
of O
plague O
to O
the O
earth O
. O

They O
can O
do O
this O
as O
many O
times O
as O
they O
want O
. O

When O
the O
two O
witnesses O
have O
finished O
telling O
their O
message O
, O
the O
beast O
will O
fight O
against O
them O
. O

This O
is O
the O
beast O
that O
comes O
up O
from O
the O
bottomless O
pit O
. O

It O
will O
defeat O
and O
kill O
them O
. O

The O
bodies O
of O
the O
two O
witnesses O
will O
lie O
in O
the O
street O
of O
the O
great O
city O
. O

This O
city O
is O
named O
Sodom O
and O
Egypt O
. O

These O
names O
for O
the O
city O
have O
a O
special O
meaning O
. O

This O
is O
the O
city O
where O
the O
Lord O
was O
killed O
. O

People O
from O
every O
race O
of O
people O
, O
tribe O
, O
language O
, O
and O
nation O
will O
look O
at O
the O
bodies O
of O
the O
two O
witnesses O
for O
three O
and O
a O
half O
days O
. O

The O
people O
will O
refuse O
to O
bury O
them O
. O

Everyone O
on O
the O
earth O
will O
be O
happy O
because O
these O
two O
are O
dead O
. O

They O
will O
have O
parties O
and O
send O
each O
other O
gifts O
. O

They O
will O
do O
this O
because O
these O
two O
prophets O
brought O
much O
suffering O
to O
the O
people O
living O
on O
earth O
. O

But O
after O
three O
and O
a O
half O
days O
, O
God O
let O
life O
enter O
the O
two O
witnesses O
again O
. O

They O
stood O
on O
their O
feet O
. O

All O
those O
who O
saw O
them O
were O
filled O
with O
fear O
. O

Then O
the O
two O
witnesses O
heard O
a O
loud O
voice O
from O
heaven O
say O
, O
`` O
Come O
up O
here O
! O
'' O

And O
both O
of O
them O
went O
up O
into O
heaven O
in O
a O
cloud O
. O

Their O
enemies O
watched O
them O
go O
. O

At O
that O
same O
time O
there O
was O
a O
great O
earthquake O
. O

A O
tenth O
of O
the O
city O
was O
destroyed O
. O

And O
7000 O
people O
were O
killed O
in O
the O
earthquake O
. O

Those O
who O
did O
not O
die O
were O
very O
afraid O
. O

They O
gave O
glory O
to O
the O
God O
of O
heaven O
. O

The O
second O
terror O
is O
now O
past O
. O

The O
third O
terror O
is O
coming O
soon O
. O

The O
seventh O
angel O
blew O
his O
trumpet O
. O

Then O
there O
were O
loud O
voices O
in O
heaven O
. O

The O
voices O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
kingdom O
of O
the O
world O
has O
now O
become O
the O
kingdom O
of O
our O
Lord O
and O
of O
his O
Christ O
. O

And O
he O
will O
rule O
forever O
and O
ever O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
24 O
elders O
bowed O
down O
on O
their O
faces O
and O
worshiped O
God O
. O

These O
are O
the O
elders O
who O
sit O
on O
their O
thrones O
before O
God O
. O

The O
elders O
said O
, O
`` O
We O
give O
thanks O
to O
you O
, O
Lord O
God O
All O
- O
Powerful O

You O
are O
the O
one O
who O
is O
and O
who O
always O
was O
. O

We O
thank O
you O
because O
you O
have O
used O
your O
great O
power O
and O
have O
begun O
to O
rule O
. O

The O
people O
of O
the O
world O
were O
angry O
, O
but O
now O
is O
the O
time O
for O
your O
anger O
. O

Now O
is O
the O
time O
for O
the O
dead O
to O
be O
judged O
. O

It O
is O
time O
to O
reward O
your O
servants O
, O
the O

and O
to O
reward O
your O
holy O
people O
, O
the O
people O
, O
great O
and O
small O
, O
who O
respect O
you O
. O

It O
is O
time O
to O
destroy O
those O
people O
who O
destroy O
the O
earth O
! O
'' O

Then O
God O
's O
temple O
in O
heaven O
was O
opened O
. O

The O
Box O
of O
the O
Agreement O
could O
be O
seen O
in O
his O
temple O
. O

Then O
there O
were O
flashes O
of O
lightning O
, O
noises O
, O
thunder O
, O
an O
earthquake O
, O
and O
a O
great O
hailstorm O
. O

Then O
I O
looked O
, O
and O
there O
before O
me O
was O
the O
Lamb O
, O
who O
was O
standing O
on O
Mount O
Zion O
. O

There O
were O
144 O
, O
000 O
people O
with O
him O
. O

They O
all O
had O
his O
name O
and O
his O
Father O
's O
name O
written O
on O
their O
foreheads O
. O

And O
I O
heard O
a O
sound O
from O
heaven O
as O
loud O
as O
the O
crashing O
of O
floodwaters O
or O
claps O
of O
thunder O
. O

But O
it O
sounded O
like O
harpists O
playing O
their O
harps O
. O

The O
people O
sang O
a O
new O
song O
before O
the O
throne O
and O
before O
the O
four O
living O
beings O
and O
the O
elders O
. O

The O
only O
ones O
who O
could O
learn O
the O
new O
song O
were O
the O
144 O
, O
000 O
who O
had O
been O
bought O
from O
the O
earth O
. O

No O
one O
else O
could O
learn O
it O
. O

These O
are O
the O
ones O
who O
did O
not O
do O
sinful O
things O
with O
women O
. O

They O
kept O
themselves O
pure O
. O

Now O
they O
follow O
the O
Lamb O
wherever O
he O
goes O
. O

They O
were O
bought O
from O
among O
the O
people O
of O
the O
earth O
as O
the O
first O
to O
be O
offered O
to O
God O
and O
the O
Lamb O
. O

They O
are O
not O
guilty O
of O
telling O
lies O
; O
they O
are O
without O
fault O
. O

Then O
I O
saw O
another O
angel O
flying O
high O
in O
the O
air O
. O

The O
angel O
had O
the O
eternal O
Good O
News O
to O
announce O
to O
the O
people O
living O
on O
earth O
-- O
to O
every O
nation O
, O
tribe O
, O
language O
, O
and O
race O
of O
people O
. O

The O
angel O
said O
in O
a O
loud O
voice O
, O
`` O
Fear O
God O
and O
give O
him O
praise O

The O
time O
has O
come O
for O

He O
made O
the O
heavens O
, O
the O
earth O
, O
the O
sea O

and O
the O
springs O
of O
water O

'' O

Then O
the O
second O
angel O
followed O
the O
first O
angel O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
She O
is O
destroyed O
! O

The O
great O
city O
of O
Babylon O
is O
destroyed O

She O
made O
all O

nations O
drink O
the O
wine O
of O
her O
sexual O
sin O

of O
God O

anger O

'' O

A O
third O
angel O
followed O
the O
first O
two O
angels O
. O

This O
third O
angel O
said O
in O
a O
loud O
voice O
, O
`` O
God O
will O
punish O
all O
those O
who O
worship O
the O
beast O

the O

to O
have O
the O
beast O

mark O
on O
their O
forehead O
or O
on O
their O
hand O
. O

They O
will O
drink O
the O
wine O
of O
God O

anger O

This O
wine O
is O
prepared O
with O
all O
its O
strength O
in O
the O
cup O
of O
God O

anger O

They O
will O
be O
tortured O
with O
burning O
sulfur O
before O
the O
holy O
angels O
and O
the O
Lamb O
. O

And O
the O
smoke O
from O
their O
burning O
pain O
will O
rise O
forever O
and O
ever O

There O
will O
be O
no O
rest O

day O
or O
night O

for O
those O
who O
worship O
the O
beast O
and O
its O
idol O
or O
who O
wear O
the O
mark O
of O
its O
name O

'' O

This O
means O
that O
God O

holy O
people O
must O
be O
patient O

They O
must O
obey O
God O
's O
commands O
and O
keep O
their O
faith O
in O
Jesus O

Then O
I O
heard O
a O
voice O
from O
heaven O
. O

It O
said O
, O
`` O
Write O
this O
: O
From O

The O
Spirit O
says O

`` O

I O
looked O
and O
there O
before O
me O
, O
sitting O
on O
a O
white O
cloud O
, O
was O
one O
who O
looked O
like O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O

He O
had O
a O
gold O
crown O
on O
his O
head O
and O
a O
sharp O
sickle O
in O
his O
hand O
. O

Then O
another O
angel O
came O
out O
of O
the O

This O
angel O
called O

So O
the O
one O
who O
was O
sitting O
on O
the O
cloud O
swung O
his O
sickle O
over O
the O
earth O

And O
the O

was O
harvested O

Then O
another O
angel O
came O
out O

This O

also O
had O
a O
sharp O

And O
then O
another O
angel O
, O
one O
with O
power O
over O
the O
fire O
, O
came O
from O
the O
altar O

He O
called O

the O
angel O
with O
the O
sharp O
sickle O

said O

`` O

The O

swung O
his O

He O
gathered O

threw O
them O
into O
the O

The O
grapes O
were O
squeezed O
in O
the O
winepress O
outside O
the O

Blood O
flowed O
out O

the O

It O
rose O
as O
high O
as O
the O
heads O

the O
horses O
for O
a O
distance O
of O
200 O

I O
saw O

One O
of O
the O
seven O
angels O
came O
and O
spoke O
to O
me O
. O

This O
was O
one O
of O
the O
angels O
that O
had O
the O
seven O
bowls O
. O

The O
angel O
said O
, O
`` O
Come O

and O
I O
will O
show O
you O
the O
punishment O

She O

the O
one O

The O
rulers O

The O
people O
of O
the O
earth O
became O
drunk O
from O
the O
wine O
of O
her O

sin O

'' O

Then O
the O
angel O
carried O
me O
away O
by O
the O
Spirit O
to O
the O
desert O
. O

There O
I O
saw O
a O
woman O
sitting O
on O
a O
red O
beast O
. O

The O
beast O
was O
covered O
with O
evil O
names O
. O

It O
had O
seven O
heads O
and O
ten O
horns O
. O

The O
woman O
was O
dressed O
in O
purple O
and O
red O
. O

She O
was O
shining O
with O
the O
gold O
, O
jewels O
, O
and O
pearls O
that O
she O
was O
wearing O
. O

She O
had O
a O
golden O
cup O
in O
her O
hand O
. O

This O
cup O
was O
filled O
with O
terribly O
evil O
things O
and O
the O
filth O
of O
her O
sexual O
sin O
. O

She O
had O
a O
title O
written O
on O
her O
forehead O
. O

This O
title O
has O
a O
hidden O
meaning O
. O

This O
is O
what O
was O
written O
: O
the O
great O
babylon O
mother O
of O
prostitutes O
and O
the O
evil O
things O
of O
the O
earth O
I O
saw O
that O
the O
woman O
was O
drunk O
. O

She O
was O
drunk O
with O
the O
blood O
of O
God O
's O
holy O
people O

She O
was O
drunk O
with O
the O
blood O
of O
those O
who O
told O
about O
their O
faith O
in O
Jesus O
. O

When O
I O
saw O
the O
woman O
, O
I O
was O
fully O
amazed O
. O

Then O
the O
angel O
said O
to O
me O
, O
`` O
Why O
are O
you O
amazed O

I O
will O
tell O
you O
the O
hidden O
meaning O
of O
this O
woman O
and O
the O
beast O
she O
rides O
-- O
the O
beast O
with O
seven O
heads O
and O
ten O
horns O

The O
beast O
you O
saw O
was O
once O
alive O

but O
now O
it O
is O
not O
. O

However O
, O
it O
will O
come O
up O
out O
of O
the O
bottomless O
pit O
and O
go O
away O
to O
be O
destroyed O
. O

The O
people O
who O
live O
on O
the O
earth O
will O
be O
amazed O
when O
they O
see O
the O
beast O
, O
because O
it O
was O
once O
alive O
, O
is O
no O
longer O
living O
, O
but O
will O
come O
again O
. O

These O
are O
the O
people O
whose O
names O
have O
never O
been O
written O
in O
the O
book O
of O
life O
since O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O

`` O
You O
need O
wisdom O
to O
understand O
this O
. O

The O
seven O
heads O
on O
the O
beast O
are O
the O
seven O
hills O
where O
the O
woman O
sits O

They O
are O
also O
seven O
rulers O

Five O
of O
the O

One O
of O
the O

now O

the O
last O
ruler O
is O
coming O

When O
he O
comes O
, O
he O
will O
stay O
only O
a O
short O
time O

The O
beast O
that O
was O
once O
alive O
but O
is O
no O

living O
is O
an O
eighth O
ruler O

This O
eighth O

he O

go O
away O

destroyed O

`` O
The O
ten O
horns O
you O
saw O

ten O
rulers O

These O
ten O
rulers O
have O
not O
yet O
received O
their O
kingdom O
, O
but O
they O
will O
receive O
power O
to O
rule O
with O
the O
beast O
for O
one O
hour O

All O
ten O
of O
these O
rulers O
have O
the O

purpose O

And O
they O
will O
give O
their O
power O

authority O
to O
the O
beast O

They O
will O
make O
war O
against O
the O
Lamb O

But O
the O
Lamb O
will O
defeat O
them O
, O
because O
he O
is O
Lord O
of O
lords O
and O
King O
of O
kings O

And O
with O
him O
will O
be O
his O

has O
called O

his O

Then O
the O
angel O
said O
to O
me O
, O
`` O
You O
saw O
the O
waters O

The O

to O

the O
great O

rules O
over O

Then O
I O
heard O
a O
loud O
voice O
from O
the O
temple O

It O
said O
to O
the O
seven O
angels O
, O
`` O
Go O
and O
pour O
out O

The O
first O

He O
poured O

Then O
all O
those O
who O
had O
the O
mark O
of O
the O
beast O
and O
who O
worshiped O
its O
idol O
got O
sores O
that O
were O
ugly O

painful O

The O
second O
angel O
poured O
out O
his O
bowl O
on O
the O
sea O

Then O
the O
sea O
became O
blood O
like O
a O
dead O
man O

blood O

And O
everything O
living O
in O
the O
sea O
died O

The O
third O
angel O
poured O
out O

bowl O
on O
the O
rivers O

the O
springs O
of O
water O

The O
rivers O
and O
the O
springs O

Then O
I O
heard O
the O
angel O

say O
to O
God O

`` O
You O

Now O
you O

given O
those O
people O

This O
is O
what O
they O
deserve O

And O
I O
heard O
the O
altar O

, O
`` O
Yes O

your O
judgments O

The O
fourth O
angel O
poured O
out O
his O
bowl O
on O
the O
sun O

The O
sun O
was O
given O
power O
to O
burn O
the O
people O
with O
fire O

The O
people O
were O
burned O
by O
the O
great O
heat O

They O
cursed O
the O
name O

who O
had O
control O
over O
these O
plagues O

But O
they O
refused O
to O
change O
their O
hearts O

lives O
and O
give O
glory O
to O
God O

The O
fifth O
angel O
poured O
out O
his O
bowl O
on O
the O
throne O
of O
the O
beast O

And O
darkness O
covered O
the O
beast O

kingdom O

People O
bit O
their O
tongues O
because O
of O
the O
pain O

They O
cursed O
the O
God O

sores O

But O
they O

The O

the O
great O
river O

The O
water O
in O
the O
river O
was O
dried O
up O

This O
prepared O
the O
way O
for O
the O
rulers O
from O
the O
east O
to O
come O
. O

Then O
I O
saw O
three O
evil O
spirits O
that O
looked O
like O
frogs O

They O
came O
out O
of O
the O
mouth O
of O
the O
dragon O

out O
of O
the O
mouth O
of O
the O
beast O
, O
and O
out O
of O
the O
mouth O
of O
the O
false O

These O
evil O
spirits O
are O
the O
spirits O
of O
demons O

They O
have O
power O

do O
miracles O

They O
go O
out O
to O
the O
rulers O

gather O
them O
for O
battle O
on O
the O
great O
day O

`` O
Listen O
! O

I O
will O
come O
at O
a O
time O
you O
do O

expect O

like O
a O
thief O

Great O
blessings O
belong O
to O
those O
who O
stay O
awake O
and O
keep O
their O
clothes O
with O
them O

They O
will O
not O
have O
to O
go O
without O
clothes O

be O
ashamed O

see O
them O

Then O
the O
evil O
spirits O
gathered O
the O
rulers O
together O
to O
the O
place O
that O
in O
Hebrew O
is O
called O
Armageddon O
. O

The O
seventh O
angel O
poured O
out O
his O
bowl O
into O
the O
air O
. O

Then O
a O
loud O
voice O
came O
out O
of O
the O
temple O
from O
the O
throne O
. O

It O
said O
, O
`` O
It O
is O
finished O
! O

Then O
there O
were O
flashes O
of O
lightning O
, O
noises O
, O
thunder O
, O
and O
a O
big O
earthquake O
. O

This O
was O
the O
worst O
earthquake O
that O
has O
ever O
happened O
since O
people O
have O
been O
on O
earth O
. O

The O
great O
city O
split O
into O
three O
parts O
. O

The O
cities O
of O
the O
nations O
were O
destroyed O
. O

And O
God O
did O
not O
forget O
to O
punish O
Babylon O
the O
Great O
. O

He O
gave O
that O
city O
the O
cup O
filled O
with O
the O
wine O
of O
his O
terrible O
anger O
. O

Every O
island O
disappeared O
and O
there O
were O
no O
more O
mountains O
. O

Giant O
hailstones O
fell O
on O
the O
people O
from O
the O
sky O
. O

These O
hailstones O
weighed O
almost O
100 O
pounds O
each O
. O

People O
cursed O
God O
because O
of O
this O
plague O
of O
the O
hail O
. O

It O
was O
terrible O
. O

Do O
n't O
speak O
angrily O
to O
an O
older O
man O
. O

But O
talk O
to O
him O
as O
if O
he O
were O
your O
father O

Treat O
the O
younger O
men O
like O
brothers O

Treat O
the O
older O
women O
like O
mothers O

And O
treat O
the O
younger O
women O
with O
respect O
like O
sisters O

Take O
care O
of O
widows O
who O
really O
need O
help O
. O

But O
if O
a O
widow O
has O
children O
or O
grandchildren O
, O
the O
first O
thing O
they O
need O
to O
learn O
is O
this O
: O
to O
show O
their O
devotion O
to O
God O
by O
taking O
care O
of O
their O
own O
family O
. O

They O
will O
be O
repaying O
their O
parents O
, O
and O
this O
pleases O
God O
. O

A O
widow O
who O
really O
needs O
help O
is O
one O
who O
has O
been O
left O
all O
alone O
. O

She O
trusts O
God O
to O
take O
care O
of O
her O
. O

She O
prays O
all O
the O
time O
, O
night O
and O
day O
, O
and O
asks O
God O
for O
help O
. O

But O
the O
widow O
who O
uses O
her O
life O
to O
please O
herself O
is O
really O
dead O
while O
she O
is O
still O
living O
. O

Tell O
the O
believers O
there O
to O
take O
care O
of O
their O
family O
so O
that O
no O
one O
can O
say O
they O
are O
doing O
wrong O
. O

Everyone O
should O
take O
care O
of O
all O
their O
own O
people O
. O

Most O
important O
, O
they O
should O
take O
care O
of O
their O
own O
family O

If O
they O
do O
not O
do O
that O
, O
then O
they O
do O
not O
accept O
what O
we O
believe O
. O

They O
are O
worse O
than O
someone O
who O
does O
not O
even O
believe O
in O
God O
. O

To O
be O
added O
to O
your O
list O
of O
widows O
, O
a O
woman O
must O
be O
60 O
years O
old O
or O
older O
. O

She O
must O
have O
been O
faithful O
to O
her O
husband O
. O

She O
must O
be O
known O
for O
the O
good O
she O
has O
done O
: O
raising O
children O
, O
welcoming O
travelers O
into O
her O
home O
, O
serving O
the O
needs O
of O
God O
's O
people O
, O
helping O
those O
in O
trouble O
, O
and O
using O
her O
life O
to O
do O
all O
kinds O
of O
good O
. O

But O
do O
n't O
put O
younger O
widows O
on O
that O
list O
. O

When O
their O
strong O
physical O
needs O
pull O
them O
away O
from O
their O
commitment O
to O
Christ O
, O
they O
will O
want O
to O
marry O
again O
. O

Then O
they O
will O
be O
guilty O
of O
not O
doing O
what O
they O
first O
promised O
to O
do O
. O

Also O
, O
these O
younger O
widows O
begin O
to O
waste O
their O
time O
going O
from O
house O
to O
house O
. O

They O
also O
begin O
to O
gossip O
and O
try O
to O
run O
other O
people O
's O
lives O
. O

They O
say O
things O
they O
should O
not O
say O
. O

So O
I O
want O
the O
younger O
widows O
to O
marry O
, O
have O
children O
, O
and O
take O
care O
of O
their O
homes O
. O

If O
they O
do O
this O
, O
our O
enemy O
will O
not O
have O
any O
reason O
to O
criticize O
them O
. O

But O
some O
of O
the O
younger O
widows O
have O
already O
turned O
away O
to O
follow O
Satan O
. O

If O
any O
woman O
who O
is O
a O
believer O
has O
widows O
in O
her O
family O
, O
she O
should O
take O
care O
of O
them O
herself O
. O

Then O
the O
church O
will O
not O
have O
that O
burden O
and O
will O
be O
able O
to O
care O
for O
the O
widows O
who O
have O
no O
one O
else O
to O
help O
them O
. O

The O
elders O
who O
lead O
the O
church O
in O
a O
good O
way O
should O
receive O
double O
honor O
-- O
in O
particular O
, O
those O
who O
do O
the O
work O
of O
counseling O
and O
teaching O
. O

As O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
When O
a O
work O
animal O
is O
being O
used O
to O
separate O
grain O
, O
do O
n't O
keep O
it O
from O
eating O
the O
grain O
. O
'' O

And O
the O
Scriptures O
also O
say O
, O
`` O
A O
worker O
should O
be O
given O
his O
pay O
. O
'' O

Do O
n't O
listen O
to O
someone O
who O
accuses O
an O
elder O
. O

You O
should O
listen O
to O
them O
only O
if O
there O
are O
two O
or O
three O
others O
who O
can O
say O
what O
the O
elder O
did O
wrong O
. O

Tell O
those O
who O
sin O
that O
they O
are O
wrong O
. O

Do O
this O
in O
front O
of O
the O
whole O
church O
so O
that O
the O
others O
will O
have O
a O
warning O
. O

Before O
God O
and O
Jesus O
Christ O
and O
the O
chosen O
angels O
, O
I O
tell O
you O
to O
make O
these O
judgments O
without O
any O
prejudice O
. O

Treat O
every O
person O
the O
same O
. O

Think O
carefully O
before O
you O
lay O
your O
hands O
on O
anyone O
to O
make O
him O
an O
elder O
. O

Do O
n't O
share O
in O
the O
sins O
of O
others O
. O

Keep O
yourself O
pure O
. O

Timothy O
, O
stop O
drinking O
only O
water O
, O
and O
drink O
a O
little O
wine O
. O

This O
will O
help O
your O
stomach O
, O
and O
you O
will O
not O
be O
sick O
so O
often O
. O

The O
sins O
of O
some O
people O
are O
easy O
to O
see O
. O

Their O
sins O
show O
that O
they O
will O
be O
judged O
. O

But O
the O
sins O
of O
some O
others O
are O
seen O
only O
later O
. O

It O
is O
the O
same O
with O
the O
good O
things O
people O
do O
. O

Some O
are O
easy O
to O
see O
. O

But O
even O
if O
they O
are O
not O
obvious O
now O
, O
none O
of O
them O
will O
stay O
hidden O
forever O
. O

Greetings O
from O
Paul O
, O
an O
apostle O
of O
Christ O
Jesus O
. O

I O
am O
an O
apostle O
by O
the O
command O
of O
God O
our O
Savior O
and O
Christ O
Jesus O
our O
hope O
. O

To O
Timothy O
, O
a O
true O
son O
to O
me O
in O
the O
faith O
we O
share O
. O

Grace O
, O
mercy O
, O
and O
peace O
from O
God O
the O
Father O
and O
Christ O
Jesus O
our O
Lord O
. O

When O
I O
went O
to O
Macedonia O
, O
I O
asked O
you O
to O
stay O
in O
Ephesus O
. O

Some O
people O
there O
are O
teaching O
things O
that O
are O
not O
true O
, O
and O
I O
want O
you O
to O
tell O
them O
to O
stop O
. O

Tell O
them O
not O
to O
give O
their O
time O
to O
meaningless O
stories O
and O
to O
long O
lists O
of O
names O
to O
prove O
their O
family O
histories O
. O

Such O
things O
only O
cause O
arguments O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
help O
God O
's O
work O
, O
which O
is O
done O
only O
by O
faith O
. O

My O
purpose O
in O
telling O
you O
to O
do O
this O
is O
to O
promote O
love O
-- O
the O
kind O
of O
love O
shown O
by O
those O
whose O
thoughts O
are O
pure O
, O
who O
do O
what O
they O
know O
is O
right O
, O
and O
whose O
faith O
in O
God O
is O
real O
. O

But O
some O
have O
missed O
this O
key O
point O
in O
their O
teaching O
and O
have O
gone O
off O
in O
another O
direction O
. O

Now O
they O
talk O
about O
things O
that O
help O
no O
one O
. O

They O
want O
to O
be O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
, O
but O
they O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
they O
are O
talking O
about O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
even O
understand O
the O
things O
they O
say O
they O
are O
sure O
of O
. O

We O
know O
that O
the O
law O
is O
good O
if O
someone O
uses O
it O
right O
. O

We O
also O
know O
that O
the O
law O
is O
not O
made O
for O
those O
who O
do O
what O
is O
right O
. O

It O
is O
made O
for O
those O
who O
are O
against O
the O
law O
and O
refuse O
to O
follow O
it O
. O

The O
law O
is O
for O
sinners O
who O
are O
against O
God O
and O
all O
that O
is O
pleasing O
to O
him O
. O

It O
is O
for O
those O
who O
have O
no O
interest O
in O
spiritual O
things O
and O
for O
those O
who O
kill O
their O
fathers O
or O
mothers O
or O
anyone O
else O
. O

It O
is O
for O
those O
who O
commit O
sexual O
sins O
, O
homosexuals O
, O
those O
who O
sell O
slaves O
, O
those O
who O
tell O
lies O
, O
those O
who O
do O
n't O
tell O
the O
truth O
under O
oath O
, O
and O
those O
who O
are O
against O
the O
true O
teaching O
of O
God O
. O

That O
teaching O
is O
part O
of O
the O
Good O
News O
that O
our O
blessed O
God O
gave O
me O
to O
tell O
. O

In O
it O
we O
see O
his O
glory O
. O

I O
thank O
Christ O
Jesus O
our O
Lord O
because O
he O
trusted O
me O
and O
gave O
me O
this O
work O
of O
serving O
him O
. O

He O
gives O
me O
strength O
. O

In O
the O
past O
I O
insulted O
Christ O
. O

As O
a O
proud O
and O
violent O
man O
, O
I O
persecuted O
his O
people O
. O

But O
God O
gave O
me O
mercy O
because O
I O
did O
not O
know O
what O
I O
was O
doing O
. O

I O
did O
that O
before O
I O
became O
a O
believer O
. O

But O
our O
Lord O
gave O
me O
a O
full O
measure O
of O
his O
grace O
. O

And O
with O
that O
grace O
came O
the O
faith O
and O
love O
that O
are O
in O
Christ O
Jesus O
. O

Here O
is O
a O
true O
statement O
that O
should O
be O
accepted O
without O
question O
: O
Christ O
Jesus O
came O
into O
the O
world O
to O
save O
sinners O
, O
and O
I O
am O
the O
worst O
of O
them O
. O

But O
I O
was O
given O
mercy O
so O
that O
in O
me O
Christ O
Jesus O
could O
show O
that O
he O
has O
patience O
without O
limit O
. O

Christ O
showed O
his O
patience O
with O
me O
, O
the O
worst O
of O
all O
sinners O
. O

He O
wanted O
me O
to O
be O
an O
example O
for O
those O
who O
would O
believe O
in O
him O
and O
have O
eternal O
life O
. O

Honor O
and O
glory O
to O
the O
King O
who O
rules O
forever O
. O

He O
can O
not O
be O
destroyed O
and O
can O
not O
be O
seen O
. O

Honor O
and O
glory O
forever O
and O
ever O
to O
the O
only O
God O
. O

Amen O
. O

Timothy O
, O
you O
are O
like O
a O
son O
to O
me O
. O

What O
I O
am O
telling O
you O
to O
do O
agrees O
with O
the O
prophecies O
that O
were O
told O
about O
you O
in O
the O
past O
. O

I O
want O
you O
to O
remember O
those O
prophecies O
and O
fight O
the O
good O
fight O
of O
faith O
. O

Continue O
to O
trust O
in O
God O
and O
do O
what O
you O
know O
is O
right O
. O

Some O
people O
have O
not O
done O
this O
, O
and O
their O
faith O
is O
now O
in O
ruins O
. O

Hymenaeus O
and O
Alexander O
are O
men O
like O
that O
. O

I O
have O
given O
them O
to O
Satan O
so O
that O
they O
will O
learn O
not O
to O
speak O
against O
God O
. O

It O
is O
a O
true O
statement O
that O
anyone O
whose O
goal O
is O
to O
serve O
as O
an O
elder O
has O
his O
heart O
set O
on O
a O
good O
work O
. O

An O
elder O
must O
be O
such O
a O
good O
man O
that O
no O
one O
can O
rightly O
criticize O
him O
. O

He O
must O
be O
faithful O
to O
his O
wife O
. O

He O
must O
have O
self O
- O
control O
and O
be O
wise O
. O

He O
must O
be O
respected O
by O
others O
. O

He O
must O
be O
ready O
to O
help O
people O
by O
welcoming O
them O
into O
his O
home O
. O

He O
must O
be O
a O
good O
teacher O
. O

He O
must O
not O
drink O
too O
much O
, O
and O
he O
must O
not O
be O
someone O
who O
likes O
to O
fight O
. O

He O
must O
be O
gentle O
and O
peaceful O
. O

He O
must O
not O
be O
someone O
who O
loves O
money O
. O

He O
must O
be O
a O
good O
leader O
of O
his O
own O
family O
. O

This O
means O
that O
his O
children O
obey O
him O
with O
full O
respect O
. O

If O
a O
man O
does O
not O
know O
how O
to O
lead O
his O
own O
family O
, O
he O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
take O
care O
of O
God O
's O
church O
. O

An O
elder O
must O
not O
be O
a O
new O
believer O
. O

It O
might O
make O
him O
too O
proud O
of O
himself O
. O

Then O
he O
would O
be O
condemned O
for O
his O
pride O
the O
same O
as O
the O
devil O
was O
. O

An O
elder O
must O
also O
have O
the O
respect O
of O
people O
who O
are O
not O
part O
of O
the O
church O
. O

Then O
he O
will O
not O
be O
criticized O
by O
others O
and O
be O
caught O
in O
the O
devil O
's O
trap O
. O

In O
the O
same O
way O
, O
the O
men O
who O
are O
chosen O
to O
be O
special O
servants O
must O
have O
the O
respect O
of O
others O
. O

They O
must O
not O
be O
men O
who O
say O
things O
they O
do O
n't O
mean O
or O
who O
spend O
their O
time O
drinking O
too O
much O
. O

They O
must O
not O
be O
men O
who O
will O
do O
almost O
anything O
for O
money O
. O

They O
must O
follow O
the O
true O
faith O
that O
God O
has O
now O
made O
known O
to O
us O
and O
always O
do O
what O
they O
know O
is O
right O
. O

You O
should O
test O
them O
first O
. O

Then O
, O
if O
you O
find O
that O
they O
have O
done O
nothing O
wrong O
, O
they O
can O
be O
special O
servants O
. O

In O
the O
same O
way O
, O
the O
women O
must O
have O
the O
respect O
of O
others O
. O

They O
must O
not O
be O
women O
who O
speak O
evil O
about O
other O
people O
. O

They O
must O
have O
self O
- O
control O
and O
be O
women O
who O
can O
be O
trusted O
in O
everything O
. O

The O
men O
who O
are O
special O
servants O
must O
be O
faithful O
in O
marriage O
. O

They O
must O
be O
good O
leaders O
of O
children O
and O
their O
own O
families O
. O

Those O
who O
do O
well O
as O
special O
servants O
are O
making O
an O
honorable O
place O
for O
themselves O
. O

And O
they O
will O
feel O
very O
sure O
of O
their O
faith O
in O
Christ O
Jesus O
. O

I O
hope O
I O
can O
come O
to O
you O
soon O
. O

But O
I O
am O
writing O
this O
to O
you O
now O
, O
so O
that O
, O
even O
if O
I O
can O
not O
come O
soon O
, O
you O
will O
know O
how O
people O
should O
live O
in O
the O
family O
of O
God O
. O

That O
family O
is O
the O
church O
of O
the O
living O
God O
. O

And O
God O
's O
church O
is O
the O
support O
and O
foundation O
of O
the O
truth O
. O

Without O
a O
doubt O
, O
the O
secret O
of O
our O
life O
of O
worship O
is O
great O
: O
Christ O
was O
shown O
to O
us O
in O
human O
form O
; O
the O
Spirit O
proved O
that O
he O
was O
right O
; O
he O
was O
seen O
by O
angels O
. O

The O
message O
about O
him O
was O
told O
to O
the O
nations O
; O
people O
in O
the O
world O
believed O
in O
him O
; O
he O
was O
taken O
up O
to O
heaven O
in O
glory O
. O

All O
those O
who O
are O
slaves O
should O
show O
full O
respect O
to O
their O
masters O
. O

Then O
God O
's O
name O
and O
our O
teaching O
will O
not O
be O
criticized O
. O

Some O
slaves O
have O
masters O
who O
are O
believers O
, O
so O
they O
are O
brothers O
. O

Does O
this O
mean O
they O
should O
show O
their O
masters O
any O
less O
respect O
? O

No O
, O
they O
should O
serve O
them O
even O
better O
, O
because O
they O
are O
helping O
believers O
, O
people O
they O
should O
love O
. O

This O
is O
what O
you O
must O
teach O
and O
tell O
everyone O
to O
do O
. O

Some O
people O
will O
teach O
what O
is O
false O
and O
will O
not O
agree O
with O
the O
true O
teaching O
of O
our O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

They O
will O
not O
accept O
the O
teaching O
that O
produces O
a O
life O
of O
devotion O
to O
God O
. O

They O
are O
proud O
of O
what O
they O
know O
, O
but O
they O
understand O
nothing O
. O

They O
are O
sick O
with O
a O
love O
for O
arguing O
and O
fighting O
about O
words O
. O

And O
that O
brings O
jealousy O
, O
quarrels O
, O
insults O
, O
and O
evil O
mistrust O
. O

They O
are O
always O
making O
trouble O
, O
because O
they O
are O
people O
whose O
thinking O
has O
been O
confused O
. O

They O
have O
lost O
their O
understanding O
of O
the O
truth O
. O

They O
think O
that O
devotion O
to O
God O
is O
a O
way O
to O
get O
rich O
. O

Devotion O
to O
God O
is O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
a O
way O
for O
people O
to O
be O
very O
rich O
, O
but O
only O
if O
it O
makes O
them O
satisfied O
with O
what O
they O
have O
. O

When O
we O
came O
into O
the O
world O
, O
we O
brought O
nothing O
. O

And O
when O
we O
die O
, O
we O
can O
take O
nothing O
out O
. O

So O
, O
if O
we O
have O
food O
and O
clothes O
, O
we O
will O
be O
satisfied O
with O
that O
. O

People O
who O
want O
to O
be O
rich O
bring O
temptations O
to O
themselves O
. O

They O
are O
caught O
in O
a O
trap O
. O

They O
begin O
to O
want O
many O
foolish O
things O
that O
will O
hurt O
them O
. O

These O
things O
ruin O
and O
destroy O
people O
. O

The O
love O
of O
money O
causes O
all O
kinds O
of O
evil O
. O

Some O
people O
have O
turned O
away O
from O
what O
we O
believe O
because O
they O
want O
to O
get O
more O
and O
more O
money O
. O

But O
they O
have O
caused O
themselves O
a O
lot O
of O
pain O
and O
sorrow O
. O

But O
you O
belong O
to O
God O
. O

So O
you O
should O
stay O
away O
from O
all O
those O
things O
. O

Always O
try O
to O
do O
what O
is O
right O
, O
to O
be O
devoted O
to O
God O
, O
and O
to O
have O
faith O
, O
love O
, O
patience O
, O
and O
gentleness O
. O

We O
have O
to O
fight O
to O
keep O
our O
faith O
. O

Try O
as O
hard O
as O
you O
can O
to O
win O
that O
fight O
. O

Take O
hold O
of O
eternal O
life O
. O

It O
is O
the O
life O
you O
were O
chosen O
to O
have O
when O
you O
confessed O
your O
faith O
in O
Jesus O
-- O
that O
wonderful O
truth O
that O
you O
spoke O
so O
openly O
and O
that O
so O
many O
people O
heard O
. O

Before O
God O
and O
Christ O
Jesus O
I O
give O
you O
a O
command O
. O

Jesus O
is O
the O
one O
who O
confessed O
that O
same O
wonderful O
truth O
when O
he O
stood O
before O
Pontius O
Pilate O
. O

And O
God O
is O
the O
one O
who O
gives O
life O
to O
everything O
. O

Now O
I O
tell O
you O
this O
: O
Do O
what O
you O
were O
commanded O
to O
do O
without O
fault O
or O
blame O
until O
the O
time O
when O
our O
Lord O
Jesus O
Christ O
comes O
again O
. O

God O
will O
make O
that O
happen O
at O
the O
right O
time O
. O

God O
is O
the O
blessed O
and O
only O
Ruler O
. O

He O
is O
the O
King O
of O
all O
kings O
and O
the O
Lord O
of O
all O
lords O
. O

God O
is O
the O
only O
one O
who O
never O
dies O
. O

He O
lives O
in O
light O
so O
bright O
that O
people O
can O
not O
go O
near O
it O
. O

No O
one O
has O
ever O
seen O
him O
; O
no O
one O
is O
able O
to O
see O
him O
. O

All O
honor O
and O
power O
belong O
to O
him O
forever O
. O

Amen O
. O

Give O
this O
command O
to O
those O
who O
are O
rich O
with O
the O
things O
of O
this O
world O
. O

Tell O
them O
not O
to O
be O
proud O
. O

Tell O
them O
to O
hope O
in O
God O
, O
not O
their O
money O
. O

Money O
can O
not O
be O
trusted O
, O
but O
God O
takes O
care O
of O
us O
richly O
. O

He O
gives O
us O
everything O
to O
enjoy O
. O

Tell O
those O
who O
are O
rich O
to O
do O
good O
-- O
to O
be O
rich O
in O
good O
works O
. O

And O
tell O
them O
they O
should O
be O
happy O
to O
give O
and O
ready O
to O
share O
. O

By O
doing O
this O
, O
they O
will O
be O
saving O
up O
a O
treasure O
for O
themselves O
. O

And O
that O
treasure O
will O
be O
a O
strong O
foundation O
on O
which O
their O
future O
life O
will O
be O
built O
. O

They O
will O
be O
able O
to O
have O
the O
life O
that O
is O
true O
life O
. O

Timothy O
, O
God O
has O
trusted O
you O
with O
many O
things O
. O

Keep O
these O
things O
safe O
. O

Stay O
away O
from O
people O
who O
talk O
about O
useless O
things O
that O
are O
not O
from O
God O
and O
who O
argue O
against O
you O
with O
a O
`` O
knowledge O
'' O
that O
is O
not O
knowledge O
at O
all O
. O

Some O
people O
who O
claim O
to O
have O
that O
`` O
knowledge O
'' O
have O
gone O
completely O
away O
from O
what O
we O
believe O
. O

God O
's O
grace O
be O
with O
you O
all O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
I O
ask O
that O
you O
pray O
for O
all O
people O
. O

Ask O
God O
to O
bless O
them O
and O
give O
them O
what O
they O
need O
. O

And O
give O
thanks O
. O

You O
should O
pray O
for O
rulers O
and O
for O
all O
who O
have O
authority O
. O

Pray O
for O
these O
leaders O
so O
that O
we O
can O
live O
quiet O
and O
peaceful O
lives O
-- O
lives O
full O
of O
devotion O
to O
God O
and O
respect O
for O
him O
. O

This O
is O
good O
and O
pleases O
God O
our O
Savior O
. O

God O
wants O
everyone O
to O
be O
saved O
and O
to O
fully O
understand O
the O
truth O
. O

There O
is O
only O
one O
God O
, O
and O
there O
is O
only O
one O
way O
that O
people O
can O
reach O
God O
. O

That O
way O
is O
through O
Christ O
Jesus O
, O
who O
as O
a O
man O
gave O
himself O
to O
pay O
for O
everyone O
to O
be O
free O
. O

This O
is O
the O
message O
that O
was O
given O
to O
us O
at O
just O
the O
right O
time O
. O

And O
I O
was O
chosen O
as O
an O
apostle O
to O
tell O
people O
that O
message O
. O

-LRB- O
I O
am O
telling O
the O
truth O
. O

I O
am O
not O
lying O
. O
-RRB- O

I O
was O
chosen O
to O
teach O
those O
who O
are O
not O
Jews O
to O
believe O
and O
understand O
the O
truth O
. O

I O
want O
the O
men O
everywhere O
to O
pray O
. O

Men O
who O
lift O
their O
hands O
in O
prayer O
must O
be O
devoted O
to O
God O
and O
pleasing O
to O
him O
. O

They O
must O
be O
men O
who O
keep O
themselves O
from O
getting O
angry O
and O
having O
arguments O
. O

And O
I O
want O
the O
women O
to O
make O
themselves O
attractive O
in O
the O
right O
way O
. O

Their O
clothes O
should O
be O
sensible O
and O
appropriate O
. O

They O
should O
not O
draw O
attention O
to O
themselves O
with O
fancy O
hairstyles O
or O
gold O
jewelry O
or O
pearls O
or O
expensive O
clothes O
. O

But O
they O
should O
make O
themselves O
attractive O
by O
the O
good O
things O
they O
do O
. O

That O
is O
more O
appropriate O
for O
women O
who O
say O
they O
are O
devoted O
to O
God O
. O

A O
woman O
should O
learn O
while O
listening O
quietly O
and O
being O
completely O
willing O
to O
obey O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
allow O
a O
woman O
to O
teach O
a O
man O
or O
tell O
him O
what O
to O
do O
. O

She O
must O
listen O
quietly O
, O
because O
Adam O
was O
made O
first O
. O

Eve O
was O
made O
later O
. O

Also O
, O
Adam O
was O
not O
the O
one O
who O
was O
tricked O
. O

It O
was O
the O
woman O
who O
was O
tricked O
and O
became O
a O
sinner O
. O

But O
women O
will O
be O
saved O
in O
their O
work O
of O
having O
children O
. O

They O
will O
be O
saved O
if O
they O
continue O
to O
live O
in O
faith O
, O
love O
, O
and O
holiness O
with O
sensible O
behavior O
. O

The O
Spirit O
clearly O
says O
that O
in O
the O
last O
times O
some O
will O
turn O
away O
from O
what O
we O
believe O
. O

They O
will O
obey O
spirits O
that O
tell O
lies O
. O

And O
they O
will O
follow O
the O
teachings O
of O
demons O
. O

Those O
teachings O
come O
through O
people O
who O
tell O
lies O
and O
trick O
others O
. O

These O
evil O
people O
can O
not O
see O
what O
is O
right O
and O
what O
is O
wrong O
. O

It O
is O
like O
their O
conscience O
has O
been O
destroyed O
with O
a O
hot O
iron O
. O

They O
say O
that O
it O
is O
wrong O
to O
marry O
. O

And O
they O
say O
that O
there O
are O
some O
foods O
that O
people O
must O
not O
eat O
. O

But O
God O
made O
these O
foods O
, O
and O
those O
who O
believe O
and O
who O
understand O
the O
truth O
can O
eat O
them O
with O
thanks O
. O

Everything O
that O
God O
made O
is O
good O
. O

Nothing O
he O
made O
should O
be O
refused O
if O
it O
is O
accepted O
with O
thanks O
to O
him O
. O

Everything O
he O
created O
is O
made O
holy O
by O
what O
he O
has O
said O
and O
by O
prayer O
. O

Tell O
this O
to O
the O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
there O
. O

This O
will O
show O
that O
you O
are O
a O
good O
servant O
of O
Christ O
Jesus O
. O

You O
will O
show O
that O
you O
are O
made O
strong O
by O
the O
words O
of O
faith O
and O
good O
teaching O
you O
have O
followed O
. O

People O
tell O
silly O
stories O
that O
do O
n't O
agree O
with O
God O
's O
truth O
. O

Do O
n't O
follow O
what O
these O
stories O
teach O
. O

But O
teach O
yourself O
to O
be O
devoted O
to O
God O
. O

Training O
your O
body O
helps O
you O
in O
some O
ways O
. O

But O
devotion O
to O
God O
helps O
you O
in O
every O
way O
. O

It O
brings O
you O
blessings O
in O
this O
life O
and O
in O
the O
future O
life O
too O
. O

Here O
is O
a O
true O
statement O
that O
should O
be O
accepted O
without O
question O
: O
We O
hope O
in O
the O
living O
God O
, O
the O
Savior O
of O
all O
people O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
he O
is O
the O
Savior O
of O
all O
those O
who O
believe O
in O
him O
. O

This O
is O
why O
we O
work O
and O
struggle O
. O

Command O
and O
teach O
these O
things O
. O

You O
are O
young O
, O
but O
do O
n't O
let O
anyone O
treat O
you O
as O
if O
you O
are O
not O
important O
. O

Be O
an O
example O
to O
show O
the O
believers O
how O
they O
should O
live O
. O

Show O
them O
by O
what O
you O
say O
, O
by O
the O
way O
you O
live O
, O
by O
your O
love O
, O
by O
your O
faith O
, O
and O
by O
your O
pure O
life O
. O

Continue O
to O
read O
the O
Scriptures O
to O
the O
people O
, O
encourage O
them O
, O
and O
teach O
them O
. O

Do O
this O
until O
I O
come O
. O

Remember O
to O
use O
the O
gift O
you O
have O
, O
which O
was O
given O
to O
you O
through O
a O
prophecy O
when O
the O
group O
of O
elders O
laid O
their O
hands O
on O
you O
. O

Continue O
to O
do O
these O
things O
. O

Give O
your O
life O
to O
doing O
them O
. O

Then O
everyone O
can O
see O
that O
your O
work O
is O
progressing O
. O

Be O
careful O
in O
your O
life O
and O
in O
your O
teaching O
. O

Continue O
to O
live O
and O
teach O
rightly O
. O

Then O
you O
will O
save O
yourself O
and O
those O
who O
listen O
to O
your O
teaching O
. O
