I O
will O
come O
back O
once O
more O
uh O
, O
to O
listen O
to O
, O
uh O
, O
Mr. O
Elie B-PERSON
Ferzli I-PERSON
and O
uh O
, O
he O
is O
with O
us O
again O
. O

Your O
Excellency O
, O
Minister O
, O
the O
government O
warned O
against O
descending O
into O
the O
street O
, O
uh O
, O
previously O
, O
that O
there O
would O
be O
another O
street O
and O
there O
might O
be O
provocations O
and O
friction O
that O
may O
lead O
to O
disastrous O
consequences O
in O
Lebanon B-GPE
. O

Why O
has O
n't O
the O
government O
brought O
its O
supporters O
to O
the O
street O
after O
this O
opposition O
crowd O
went O
out O
? O

in O
our O
personal O
judgment O
, O
to O
threaten O
one O
street O
with O
another O
street O
, O
which O
was O
issued O
by O
some O
, O
uh O
, O
mouthpieces O
of O
the O
authorities O
and O
some O
figures O
, O
uh O
, O
of O
the O
parliamentary O
majority O
, O
uh O
, O
its O
purpose O
was O
to O
stir O
up O
agitation O
in O
the O
path O
of O
the O
opposition O
and O
, O
as O
a O
result O
, O
to O
be O
satisfied O
and O
not O
resort O
to O
expressing O
itself O
through O
this O
huge O
phenomenon O
that O
is O
taking O
place O
in O
the O
, O
uh O
, O
well O
known O
squares O
of O
Beirut B-GPE
. O

Uh O
, O
however O
, O
when O
they O
sensed O
the O
seriousness O
, O
uh O
, O
of O
going O
out O
and O
they O
sensed O
the O
seriousness O
of O
this O
popular O
flood O
, O
the O
seriousness O
of O
this O
popular O
presence O
, O
and O
the O
seriousness O
of O
the O
existing O
division O
, O
they O
felt O
they O
had O
to O
be O
satisfied O
, O
uh O
, O
uh O
, O
because O
their O
descent O
into O
the O
street O
, O
uh O
, O
would O
have O
been O
a O
descent O
against O
the O
authorities O
, O
because O
demonstrating O
usually O
is O
one O
. O

Is O
it O
permissible O
for O
the O
government O
to O
lead O
a O
riot O
among O
the O
people O
, O
to O
push O
people O
against O
people O
? O

Usually O
in O
all O
the O
countries O
of O
the O
world O
, O
we O
know O
that O
the O
opposition O
descends O
to O
express O
its O
opinion O
within O
the O
confines O
of O
the O
constitution O
in O
a O
peaceful O
and O
civilized O
way O
, O
and O
this O
is O
what O
happened O
against O
the O
existing O
authorities O
. O

Our O
authorities O
here O
make O
people O
descend O
unless O
their O
objective O
is O
to O
push O
things O
towards O
an O
internal O
riot O
, O
and O
this O
I O
think O
is O
something O
that O
will O
leave O
very O
negative O
fingerprints O
on O
it O
. O

Um O
. O

Yes O
. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O

Hello O

good O
evening O

If O

Lebanon B-GPE
, O
I O
mean O
, O
uh O
, O
Hajj B-PERSON
Hassan I-PERSON
Ezz I-PERSON
Eddine I-PERSON
, O
how O
would O
you O
evaluate O
the O
situation O
now O
in O
the O
light O
of O
successive O
developments O
with O
regards O
to O
initiatives O
and O
mediations O
, O
whether O
spiritual O
or O
political O
, O
Lebanese B-NORP
and O
Arab B-NORP
? O

I O
mean O
, O
in O
the O
last O
minutes O
before O
the O
program O
, O
uh O
, O
some O
glimmers O
of O
hope O
started O
to O
appear O
on O
the O
chances O
of O
success O
of O
the O
Arab B-NORP
initiative O
. O

How O
do O
you O
in O
Hezbollah B-ORG
read O
it O
? O

I O
mean O
, O
to O
begin O
with O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
say O
that O
what O
happened O
yesterday O
was O
a O
historic O
referendum O
in O
the O
history O
of O
Lebanon B-GPE
, O
since O
its O
establishment O
and O
until O
this O
moment O
. O

Yes O
. O

This O
national O
opposition O
, O
with O
its O
varied O
sectarian O
powers O
and O
varied O
political O
powers O
also O
, O
uh O
, O
was O
, O
uh O
, O
of O
one O
tendency O
that O
it O
is O
uh O
, O
no O
longer O
possible O
to O
continue O
with O
, O
this O
authority O
which O
, O
uh O
, O
extorted O
, O
uh O
, O
governance O
. O

It O
is O
illegitimate O
and O
unconstitutional O
. O

It O
still O
covers O
its O
ears O
and O
, O
uh O
, O
does O
not O
see O
what O
happens O
meters O
away O
from O
it O
. O

Uh O
, O
it O
claims O
democracy O
; O
it O
did O
not O
respond O
to O
the O
will O
of O
people O
. O

Uh O
, O
the O
opposition O
determined O
, O
uh O
, O
its O
goals O
, O
uh O
, O
that O
without O
a O
national O
unity O
government O
, O
there O
is O
no O
meaning O
for O
any O
proposition O
or O
for O
any O
initiative O
that O
could O
come O
, O
uh O
, O
at O
the O
local O
level O
, O
or O
at O
the O
regional O
level O
, O
or O
at O
the O
international O
level O
. O

Doctor O
Imad B-PERSON
, O
I O
mean O
, O
until O
when O
do O
you O
expect O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
the O
lack O
of O
stability O
in O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
matter O
? O

I O
mean O
, O
uh O
, O
at O
the O
start O
, O
what O
you O
presented O
in O
a O
compilation O
of O
conflicting O
news O
uh O
, O
uh O
, O
takes O
us O
towards O
optimism O
then O
takes O
us O
back O
to O
pessimism O
, O
of O
questions O
you O
put O
forward O
at O
the O
end O
of O
your O
introduction O
, O
I O
think O
, O
uh O
, O
this O
represents O
the O
essence O
of O
what O
is O
the O
reality O
now O
in O
the B-GPE
Palestinian I-GPE
Territories I-GPE
. O

The O
impasse O
continues O
and O
the O
crisis O
continues O
and O
beyond O
optimism O
, O
and O
pessimism O
and O
hopes O
, O
I O
think O
that O
the O
crisis O
will O
be O
with O
us O
, O
uh O
, O
for O
a O
long O
time O
because O
, O
quite O
simply O
, O
the O
priority O
for O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
factions O
now O
are O
the O
factions O
' O
issue O
at O
the O
expense O
of O
the O
general O
Palestinian B-NORP
issue O
. O

Uh O
, O
all O
, O
uh O
, O
uh O
, O
the O
leaders O
, O
when O
they O
talk O
, O
and O
we O
're O
talking O
specifically O
about O
Fatah B-ORG
and O
Hamas B-ORG
in O
particular O
, O
offer O
good O
intentions O
. O

The O
Palestinian B-NORP
Prime O
Minister O
Ismail B-PERSON
Haniya I-PERSON
, O
contrary O
to O
what O
the O
program O
of O
the O
movement O
says O
, O
offered O
a O
new O
vision O
that O
says O
the O
movement O
will O
accept O
a O
Palestinian B-NORP
state O
along O
the B-LOC
'67 I-LOC
borders I-LOC
. O

Olmert B-PERSON
, O
at O
Ben B-PERSON
Gurion I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
grave O
, O
said O
he O
was O
ready O
to O
withdraw O
from O
the B-GPE
Palestinian I-GPE
West I-GPE
Bank I-GPE
along O
the B-LOC
'67 I-LOC
border I-LOC
, O
contiguous O
in O
its O
parts O
and O
geographically O
. O

Uh O
, O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
side O
constantly O
declares O
that O
we O
are O
very O
close O
to O
forming O
a O
new O
national O
unity O
government O
and O
what O
is O
more O
important O
to O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
situation O
. O
If O
we O
put O
together O
all O
these O
issues O
, O
it O
would O
be O
possible O
to O
say O
that O
perhaps O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
issue O
can O
be O
resolved O
tomorrow O
or O
the O
day O
after O
. O

What O
is O
stopping O
the O
talks O
from O
starting O
when O
Olmert B-PERSON
is O
ready O
? O

You O
used O
a O
very O
particular O
expression O
, O
which O
is O
the O
imbalance O
the O
Israeli B-NORP
government O
is O
going O
through O
, O
an O
extremely O
serious O
matter O
because O
there O
are O
calculations O
behind O
uh O
the O
speech O
Olmert B-PERSON
made O
at O
, O
uh O
, O
Ben B-PERSON
Gurion I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
grave O
and O
he O
said O
in O
it O
that O
these O
matters O
are O
all O
words O
directed O
at O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
of I-GPE
America I-GPE
, O
words O
directed O
at O
the B-ORG
Quartet I-ORG
Committee I-ORG
and O
those O
in O
Israel B-GPE
. O

I O
begin O
with O
Mr. O
Mohammed B-PERSON
Al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Dini I-PERSON
; O
he O
is O
with O
us O
live O
from O
Amman B-GPE
. O

Are O
we O
experiencing O
a O
Sunni B-NORP
Shiite B-NORP
strife O
that O
is O
beginning O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
? O

Uh O
, O
in O
the O
name O
of O
God O
most O
merciful O
most O
compassionate O
. O

Uh O
, O
when O
America B-GPE
came O
and O
occupied O
, O
uh O
, O
Iraq B-GPE
, O
uh O
, O
it O
undertook O
the O
destruction O
of O
everything O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
, O
uh O
, O
including O
the O
destruction O
of O
the O
structures O
, O
uh O
, O
of O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
State O
, O
which O
is O
more O
than O
80 B-DATE
years I-DATE
old O
, O
uh O
, O
since O
, O
uh O
, O
it O
destroyed O
uh O

all O
these O
institutions O

the O
military O
institutions O
, O
the O
services O
, O
economic O
and O
security O
institutions O
, O
and O
even O
the O
oil O
institutions O
. O

That O
in O
itself O
, O
it O
uh O
, O
is O
a O
real O
collapse O
and O
a O
comprehensive O
destruction O
of O
the O
real O
structure O
of O
uh O
, O
society O
in O
Iraq B-GPE

Are O
we O
in O
a O
civil O
war O
now O
, O
Mr. O
Mohammed B-PERSON
? O

Uh O
, O
-- O

Uh O
, O
now O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
disagree O
with O
those O
who O
say O
that O
there O
is O
a O
civil O
war O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
now O
. O

There O
is O
, O
uh O
, O
political O
sectarian O
uh O

strife O
, O
uh O
, O
that O
came O
along O
with O
the O
occupier O
and O
with O
the O
agenda O
of O
the O
occupier O
that O
is O
nourished O
on O
a O
large O
scale O
by O
, O
uh O
, O
neighboring O
countries O
of O
Iraq B-GPE
, O
and O
specifically O
here O
Iran B-GPE

uh O

which O
is O
acting O

stir O
up O

time O

He O

if O

I O
remember O
that O
day O
Speaker O
Nabih B-PERSON
Berri I-PERSON

confronting O

and O
telling O
him O
, O
Prime O

oh O

told O

: O
Mr. O
Fouad B-PERSON
Siniora I-PERSON
, O
Prime O
Minister O
, O
by O
God O
it O
is O
a O
shame O

a O
disgrace O
that O
you O

us O
, O
you O
give O
us O
two O
options O
, O
either O
to O

over O
our O

Aharon B-PERSON
Barak I-PERSON
in O
the B-FAC
Supreme I-FAC
Court I-FAC

Justice I-FAC
yesterday O
that O
the O

the O
right O

this O

not O
against O

Please O

Me O
or O
you O
, O
it O
is O
good O
that O
you O
started O
with O
this O
question O
because O
in O
my O
opinion O
it O
is O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
that O
appeared O
in O
the O
newspaper O
in O
the O
headlines O
in O
the O
Hebrew B-LANGUAGE

today O
. O

Aha O

I O

this O
ah O
ah O
represents O
an O
underlying O
bias O

the O
Israeli B-NORP
judiciary O
as O
a O
whole O
for O
the O
logic O
of O

Aha O

legitimizing O
killings O

to O
everyone O
that O
the O
Israeli B-NORP
judicial O
establishment O
with O
its O
highest O
authority O
is O
part O
of O
the O
ruling O
Israeli B-NORP
establishment O
, O
part O
of O
the O
occupation O
, O
part O
of O
the O
suppression O
process O
the O
occupation O
country O
is O
practicing O
against O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
people O
. O

Ah O
previously O
, O
the O
legal O
system O
would O
ignore O
incidents O
of O
lawbreaking O
and O
violations O
, O
and O
as O
we O
know O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
during O
long O
years O
of O
the O
uprising O
and O
years O
of O
occupation O
, O
we O
did O
not O
witness O
any O
case O
of O
a O
real O
trial O
for O
ah O
anyone O
committing O
one O
of O
these O
crimes O
, O
neither O
at O
the O
political O
level O
, O
nor O
at O
the O
military O
level O
. O

Aha O
. O

Aha O
. O

Aha O
. O

Now O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
Barak B-PERSON
as O
they O
say O
, O
and O
admits O
that O
killing O
outside O
the O
framework O
of O
the O
law O
is O
permissible O
, O
gives O
it O
legitimacy O
, O
this O
is O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
impudence O
in O
itself O
no O
more O
. O

In O
your O
opinion O
such O
law O
, O
how O
could O
it O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
be O
used O
on O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
and O
diplomatic O
levels O
in O
front O
of O
the O
world O
? O

The O
Israeli B-NORP
judiciary O
gives O
an O
authorization O
to O
every O
Israeli B-NORP
soldier O
to O
commit O
murder O
and O
he O
wo O
n't O
be O
punished O
. O

Actually O
, O
there O
are O
ah O
tens O
of O
files O
that O
the O
Palestinians B-NORP
and O
the O
Arabs B-NORP
ah O
should O
use O
, O
starting O
from O
the B-ORG
Wall I-ORG
File I-ORG
, O
The O
Hague B-ORG
and O
all O
the O
United B-ORG
Nations I-ORG
resolutions O
regarding O
the O
occupation O
and O
settlement O
. O

Aha O
. O

This O
issue O
increases O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
definitely O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
it O
is O
supposed O
ah O
to O
grant O
Palestinians B-NORP
and O
Arabs B-NORP
ah O
a O
right O
and O
legal O
weapon O
on O
the O
international O
level O
to O
reveal O
the O
discrimination O
of O
this O
occupying O
state O
and O
reveal O
that O
it O
is O
a O
country O
outside O
ah O
ah O
international O
law O
. O

Aha O
. O

It O
considered O
itself O
above O
the O
law O
, O
does O
not O
abide O
by O
any O
law O
or O
by O
any O
legal O
standards O
, O
neither O
on O
the O
international O
level O
, O
nor O
even O
on O
the O
local O
level O
. O

Yasser O
, O
some O
people O
might O
put O
forward O
a O
question O
, O
which O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
you O
to O
analyze O
, O
but O
some O
people O
might O
say O
that O
Jordan O
does O
not O
go O
far O
in O
this O
mediation O
because O
it O
's O
seen O
as O
backing O
one O
side O
and O
not O
the O
other O
while O
there O
has O
been O
a O
misunderstanding O
regarding O
Haniya O
's O
latest O
visit O
which O
was O
to O
be O
to O
Jordan O
. O

Jordan O
its O
position O
of O
supporting O
the O
Palestinian O
Authority O
is O
known O
and O
, O
uh O
, O
its O
bias O
towards O
the O
project O
adopted O
by O
the O
Fatah O
movement O
, O
the O
peaceful O
settlement O
project O
. O

Jordan O
's O
relationship O
with O
Hamas O
is O
a O
relationship O
that O
passed O
through O
bad O
phases O
and O
even O
after O
the O
Hamas O
victory O
, O
the O
relationship O
with O
Hamas O
, O
uh O
, O
was O
very O
bad O
and O
, O
uh O
, O
especially O
after O
the O
issue O
known O
as O
arms O
smuggling O
and O
so O
forth O
. O

But O
uh O
with O
regard O
to O
Hamas O
, O
uh O
, O
there O
remain O
open O
lines O
with O
Jordan O
on O
security O
levels O
and O
Hamas O
welcomes O
this O
relationship O
, O
according O
to O
what O
more O
than O
one O
Hamas O
officials O
has O
said O
more O
than O
once O
. O

Now O
Jordan O
's O
relationship O
with O
Hamas O
falls O
within O
the O
framework O
of O
mediation O
uh O
according O
to O
statements O
by O
Jordanian O
officials O
, O
mediation O
to O
preserve O
Palestinian O
blood O
. O

Now O
, O
uh O
, O
accepting O
this O
mediation O
or O
rejecting O
it O
is O
up O
to O
Hamas O
and O
the O
Palestinian O
Authority O
. O

As O
I O
told O
you O
, O
the O
Palestinian O
Authority O
may O
reject O
, O
uh O
, O
mediation O
, O
and O
perhaps O
certain O
sides O
in O
the O
Palestinian O
Authority O
may O
attempt O
to O
block O
Hamas O
and O
stop O
it O
leaving O
Jordan O
or O
somewhere O
other O
than O
Jordan O
, O
and O
this O
is O
a O
matter O
for O
the O
Palestinians O
. O

Um O
. O

Yes O
, O
Yasser O
. O

Yes O
. O

Jordan O
ended O
it O
role O
by O
inviting O
the O
sides O
to O
the O
Palestinian O
dispute O
at O
this O
stage O
to O
the O
reconciliation O
in O
Amman O
. O

Okay O
. O

Thank O
you O
, O
Yasser O
Abu O
Helal O
, O
head O
of O
Al O
Jazeera O
's O
Amman O
desk O
. O

Mr. O
Azzam B-PERSON
, O
to O
begin O
with O
, O
could O
you O
guide O
us O
, O
if O
possible O
, O
to O
a O
clear O
and O
numbered O
provision O
in O
the O
constitution O
that O
allows O
President O
Abbas B-PERSON
to O
call O
for O
these O
early O
elections O
? O

I O
mean O
, O
first O
of O
all O
, O
uh O
, O
the O
president O
is O
an O
elected O
president O
, O
and O
is O
the O
steward O
of O
Palestinian B-NORP
interests O
. O

There O
is O
no O
clear O
provision O
in O
the O
statute O
that O
stipulates O
the O
right O
of O
the O
president O
to O
dissolve O
the O
legislative O
council O
. O

Here O
I O
say O
that O
the O
call O
for O
elections O
does O
not O
mean O
the O
dissolution O
of O
the O
legislative O
council O
. O

According O
to O
our O
system O
, O
the O
previous O
council O
remains O
in O
place O
and O
its O
term O
ends O
with O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
term O
of O
the O
new O
council O
, O
as O
happened O
in O
the O
past O
. O

And O
there O
is O
no O
provision O
that O
prevents O
the O
president O
from O
calling O
for O
early O
elections O
, O
so O
the O
original O
case O
is O
permissible O
. O

French B-NORP
law O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
prominent O
laws O
among O
the O
countries O
, O
uh O
, O
that O
provide O
for O
that O
. O

Okay O
. O

Okay O
, O
Mr. O
Azzam B-PERSON
, O
do O
you O
agree O
that O
the O
step O
that O
President O
Abbas B-PERSON
has O
taken O
, O
uh O
, O
in O
fact O
represents O
a O
violation O
of O
the O
principle O
of O
the O
separation O
of O
powers O
. O

Is O
n't O
that O
so O
? O

No O
. O

The O
president O
is O
the O
head O
of O
the O
executive O
power O
, O
and O
is O
the O
sponsor O
of O
the O
three O
powers O
, O
according O
to O
statute O
and O
we O
're O
in O
a O
real O
trouble O
, O
political O
trouble O
. O

The O
Palestinian B-NORP
political O
powers O
have O
failed O
to O
agree O
in O
order O
to O
get O
out O
of O
the O
crisis O
. O

The O
president O
has O
to O
take O
action O
. O

This O
is O
what O
the O
people O
, O
and O
all O
the O
polls O
, O
have O
demanded O
. O

According O
to O
the O
last O
poll O
, O
92 O
percent O
of O
the O
people O
surveyed O
said O
that O
the O
president O
has O
to O
take O
action O
so O
that O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
people O
can O
get O
out O
of O
the O
tragedy O
they O
are O
in O
. O

Okay O
. O

And O
joining O
us O
from O
Tripoli B-GPE
Libya B-GPE
is O
our O
correspondent O
Khaled B-PERSON
El I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Deeb I-PERSON
. O

Khaled B-PERSON
, O
first O
, O
what O
are O
the O
aspects O
of O
this O
ruling O
and O
can O
the O
defense O
appeal O
it O
? O

Yes O
, O
the O
ruling O
relied O
on O
Article B-LAW
53 I-LAW
of I-LAW
the I-LAW
Libyan I-LAW
Penal I-LAW
Code I-LAW
, O
which O
pertains O
to O
spreading O
diseases O
. O

This B-LAW
Article I-LAW
confirms O
that O
if O
the O
epidemic O
is O
spread O
to O
one O
person O
, O
the O
sentence O
will O
be O
life O
in O
prison O
, O
but O
if O
the O
epidemic O
was O
spread O
to O
more O
than O
one O
person O
, O
the O
sentence O
is O
the O
death O
penalty O
. O

This O
is O
the O
uh O
, O
legal O
aspect O
in O
this O
case O
. O

As O
for O
background O
of O
this O
case O
, O
this O
sentence O
, O
despite O
its O
strength O
and O
despite O
its O
impact O
, O
the O
defendants O
still O
have O
an O
opportunity O
to O
appeal O
the O
ruling O
before O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
. O

Yes O
, O
so O
what O
was O
the O
impact O
of O
the O
ruling O
on O
those O
present O
, O
especially O
on O
the O
defendants O
and O
also O
on O
the O
families O
of O
the O
victims O
? O

With O
respect O
to O
the O
defendants O
, O
there O
was O
no O
strong O
reaction O
; O
in O
fact O
, O
some O
received O
it O
with O
a O
smile O
, O
but O
outside O
the O
walls O
of O
the O
Court B-FAC
, O
the O
families O
of O
the O
victims O
were O
impatiently O
waiting O
for O
the O
issuing O
of O
this O
sentence O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
the O
ruling O
was O
issued O
, O
shouts O
and O
shrill O
cries O
arose O
, O
and O
uh O
, O
they O
confirmed O
that O
this O
was O
just O
punishment O
and O
that O
truth O
had O
prevailed O
for O
them O
, O
and O
that O
their O
suffering O
, O
which O
lasted O
more O
than O
eight O
years O
, O
had O
found O
its O
way O
to O
a O
solution O
, O
or O
at O
least O
punishment O
, O
while O
waiting O
to O
set O
up O
what O
wasagreed O
agreed O
upon O
in O
a O
humanitarian O
aspect O
, O
apart O
from O
the O
legal O
aspect O
, O
which O
is O
the O
International O
Compensation O
Fund O
that O
was O
agreed O
upon O
. O

But O
so O
far O
, O
the O
way O
to O
make O
it O
an O
effective O
international O
fund O
has O
not O
been O
found O
. O

Khaled B-PERSON
El I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Deeb I-PERSON
, O
our O
correspondent O
in O
Tripoli B-GPE
, O
thank O
you O
. O

Let O
me O
shift O
to O
Beirut B-GPE
, O
to O
Mr. O
Fayyad B-PERSON
Habib I-PERSON
. O

Mr. O
Fayyad B-PERSON
, O
I O
mean O
, O
after O
Amr B-PERSON
Moussa I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
talks O
today O
, O
can O
we O
say O
there O
is O
any O
progress O
in O
the O
air O
? O

Well O
, O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
is O
that O
if O
the O
decision O
were O
left O
to O
the O
ruling O
party O
in O
Lebanon B-GPE
, O
perhaps O
there O
would O
be O
a O
possibility O
of O
success O
for O
the O
Arab B-NORP
initiative O
. O

But O
unfortunately O
, O
the O
Lebanese B-NORP
crisis O
at O
this O
time O
in O
particular O
defies O
resolution O
, O
because O
the O
key O
to O
the O
solution O
is O
not O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
any O
of O
the O
Lebanese B-NORP
. O

Instead O
, O
the O
key O
to O
the O
solution O
right O
now O
is O
in O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
of I-GPE
America I-GPE
. O

And O
since O
the O
American B-NORP
orientation O
so O
far O
has O
not O
been O
completely O
elaborated O
, O
especially O
after O
, O
the O
Baker B-PERSON
- O
Hamilton B-PERSON
report O
, O
in O
my O
estimation O
, O
the O
situation O
in O
Lebanon B-GPE
will O
remain O
pending O
the O
clarification O
of O
perceptions O
that O
the O
American B-NORP
administration O
wants O
to O
adopt O
at O
the O
level O
of O
the O
region O
as O
a O
whole O
. O

Consequently O
, O
Lebanon B-GPE
in O
this O
situation O
does O
not O
, O
you O
know O
, O
represent O
an O
independent O
issue O
for O
the O
American B-NORP
administration O
as O
much O
as O
it O
is O
an O
arena O
or O
a O
pressure O
card O
through O
which O
it O
wants O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
other O
relevant O
parties O
in O
the O
region O
. O

Welcome O

say O
on O
this O

to O
all O
of O
us O
? O

The O
thirty O
- O
fifth O
anniversary O
ah O
of O
the O
federation O
, O
a O
special O
occasion O
to O
all O
of O
us O
. O

Ah O
an O
occasion O
ah O
I O
mean O
, O
during O
which O
we O
think O
of O
the O
great O
achievements O
of O
this O
nation O
, O
we O
think O
of O
ah O
how O
we O
became O
ah O
of O
the O
pioneer O
Arab B-NORP
countries O
that O
are O
pointed O
to O
ah O
with O
the O
fingers O
after O
I O
mean O
ah O
hard O
beginnings O
. O

And O
actually O
ah O
I O
mean O
, O
we O
have O
been O
blessed O
with O
a O
political O
leadership O
ah O
I O
mean O
insightful O
, O
ambitious O
, O
and O
on O
top O
of O
it O
of O
course O
the O
late O
Sheikh O
Zayed B-PERSON
Bin I-PERSON
Sultan I-PERSON
Al I-PERSON
Nahyan I-PERSON
, O
God O
bless O
his O
soul O
. O

I O
am O
from O
the O
federation O
generation O
, O
I O
am O
ah O
from O
those O
, O
I O
mean O
ah O
ah O
who O
were O
sent O
abroad O
, O
and O
I O
studied O
abroad O
, O
and O
I O
lived O
all O
those O
stages O
, O
and O
I O
say O
that O
the O
human O
being O
has O
ah O
I O
mean O
an O
amazing O
ability O
to O
ah O
I O
mean O
accept O
change O
. O

But O
there O
ah O
the O
human O
being O
also O
has O
moments O
in O
which O
he O
stops O
with O
patience O
and O
ah O
thinks O
of O
the O
stages O
that O
passed O
in O
order O
to O
realize O
the O
reality O
of O
the O
greatness O
of O
the O
experience O
and O
the O
greatness O
of O
the O
journey O
that O
ah O
I O
mean O
we O
have O
accomplished O
. O

A O
blessed O
journey O
ah O
led O
today O
by O
His O
Highness O
Sheikh O
Khalifa B-PERSON
Bin I-PERSON
Zayed I-PERSON
Al I-PERSON
Nahyan I-PERSON
and O
His O
Highness O
Sheikh O
Mohamed B-PERSON
ah I-PERSON
Bin I-PERSON
Rashid I-PERSON
Al I-PERSON
Maktoum I-PERSON
. O

Ah O
and O
we O
expect O
, O
God O
willing O
, O
in O
the O
coming O
periods O
that O
we O
go O
from O
success O
to O
another O
success O
; O
it O
is O
a O
very O
special O
occasion O
and O
a O
precious O
national O
anniversary O
. O

Yes O
. O

Yes O
, O
allow O
me O
to O
go O
back O
to O
Dr. O
Saged B-PERSON
Hamid I-PERSON
. O

Dr. O
Saged B-PERSON
ah O
I O
would O
like O
to O
pause O
with O
the O
bombing O
that O
happened O
today O
in O
al B-LOC
- I-LOC
Tayaran I-LOC
Square I-LOC
, O
I O
mean O
, O
which O
is O
considered O
the O
fourth O
to O
target O
this O
square O
in O
mid-Baghdad B-GPE
. O

First O
, O
why O
this O
targeting O
, O
especially O
that O
those O
who O
were O
present O
there O
, O
as O
you O
know O
, O
were O
ordinary O
construction O
workers O
and O
they O
do O
not O
represent O
any O
official O
agency O
or O
specific O
sect O
? O

I O
mean O
, O
and O
why O
have O
n't O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
security O
agencies O
learned O
how O
to O
deal O
with O
such O
bombings O
or O
limit O
them O
, O
or O
even O
defeat O
them O
if O
they O
could O
do O
so O
? O

And O
some O
also O
ask O
about O
those O
who O
support O
these O
groups O
and O
who O
support O
these O
bombings O
which O
were O
able O
to O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
penetrate O
all O
the O
security O
barriers O
that O
surround O
Baghdad B-GPE
. O

I O
believe O
the O
goal O
of O
these O
operations O
is O
to O
paralyze O
life O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
, O
especially O
in O
Baghdad B-GPE
, O
the O
capital O
. O

Yes O
. O

You O
find O
that O
assassinations O
include O
university O
professors O
, O
craftsmen O
and O
ordinary O
workers O
, O
and O
all O
areas O
of O
life O
, O
even O
the O
poorer O
districts O
. O

The O
goal O
is O
to O
create O
a O
shake O
- O
up O
of O
stability O
, O
political O
instability O
and O
a O
shake O
up O
of O
security O
, O
and O
accordingly O
to O
spread O
terror O
and O
fear O
, O
especially O
that O
the O
crime O
of O
terrorism O
has O
a O
political O
aim O
, O
a O
crime O
, O
its O
goal O
is O
to O
spread O
horror O
and O
terrorism O
and O
loss O
of O
trust O
in O
the O
nation O
and O
the O
security O
agencies O
, O
and O
accordingly O
the O
citizen O
loses O
his O
loyalty O
to O
his O
nation O
and O
does O
not O
trust O
the O
government O
and O
the O
nation O
. O

Okay O
, O
Mr. O
Demis B-PERSON
from O
Portland B-GPE
, O
do O
you O
share O
Mr. O
Vegan B-PERSON
Zino I-PERSON
's O
opinion O
? O

How O
can O
the O
new O
Security B-ORG
Council I-ORG
resolutions O
change O
, O
especially O
with O
relation O
to O
the O
Middle B-LOC
East I-LOC
issues O
, O
and O
he O
mentioned O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
in O
particular O
and O
Bolton B-PERSON
's O
push O
towards O
imposing O
sanctions O
on O
it O
and O
the O
efforts O
he O
made O
for O
that O
purpose O
? O

Will O
this O
perhaps O
positively O
be O
reflected O
now O
that O
Bolton B-PERSON
has O
left O
with O
his O
hard O
line O
policy O
and O
even O
his O
way O
of O
talking O
about O
various O
issues O
? O

I O
think O
that O
most O
of O
Bolton B-PERSON
's O
efforts O
were O
aimed O
at O
the O
hawkish O
view O
towards O
Iran B-GPE
. O

We O
have O
to O
say O
something O
on O
this O
issue O
. O

From O
the O
start O
, O
they O
exerted O
pressure O
in O
order O
to O
impose O
sanctions O
and O
a O
strict O
policy O
, O
stricter O
than O
the O
policies O
of O
other O
Security B-ORG
Council I-ORG
member O
states O
, O
and O
this O
is O
why O
Security B-ORG
Council I-ORG
member O
states O
and O
other O
states O
did O
n't O
agree O
with O
these O
policies O
, O
and O
this O
led O
to O
division O
. O

Of O
course O
the O
other O
parties O
did O
n't O
exert O
this O
kind O
of O
pressure O
and O
did O
n't O
want O
this O
policy O
against O
Iran B-GPE
. O

Bolton B-PERSON
did O
n't O
hesitate O
to O
follow O
this O
strict O
policy O
against O
Iran B-GPE
, O
and O
he O
was O
n't O
able O
to O
convince O
the O
other O
states O
to O
follow O
this O
same O
policy O
. O

He O
may O
even O
, O
at O
times O
, O
have O
overstated O
the O
importance O
of O
the O
Iranian B-NORP
nuclear O
issue O
. O

Then O
, O
I O
predict O
that O
the O
person O
who O
will O
replace O
Bolton B-PERSON
wo O
n't O
be O
from O
the O
military O
or O
from O
the O
hard O
liners O
, O
especially O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
Iranian B-NORP
nuclear O
issue O
. O

This O
may O
lead O
to O
improvements O
in O
Iranian B-NORP
American B-NORP
relations O
. O

How O
accurate O
is O
the O
revelation O
of O
armed O
groups O
leaders O
or O
gunmen O
who O
direct O
armed O
activity O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
from O
neighboring O
countries O
? O

And O
uh O
, O
some O
of O
them O
have O
been O
captured O
with O
coordination O
between O
the O
intelligence O
services O
of O
the O
two O
sides O
. O

Have O
you O
gotten O
to O
the O
point O
of O
revealing O
the O
papers O
, O
what O
was O
paid O
, O
the O
price O
? O

I O
can O
say O
that O
coordination O
was O
not O
sufficiently O
adequate O
. O

But O
recently O
, O
there O
has O
been O
a O
degree O
of O
coordination O
in O
the O
area O
of O
information O
, O

It O
may O
have O
helped O
Iraq B-GPE
and O
helped O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
security O
services O
in O
capturing O
some O
of O
them O
or O
exposing O
some O
terrorist O
organizations O
. O

But O
allow O
me O
to O
say O
: O
you O
did O
not O
ask O
about O
this O
, O
but O
what O
gave O
us O
the O
ability O
to O
pursue O
the O
terrorists O
, O
and O
specifically O
those O
who O
are O
foreigners O
or O
from O
neighboring O
countries O
, O
is O
the O
feeling O
and O
awareness O
among O
many O
Iraqis B-NORP
who O
, O
uh O
, O
apparently O
out O
of O
well O
- O
meaning O
and O
good O
intentions O
, O
joined O
these O
organizations O
-- O
or O
out O
of O
carelessness O
. O

Now O
they O
have O
begun O
to O
feel O
guilty O
in O
their O
conscience O
and O
accountable O
because O
they O
harmed O
their O
nation O
, O
they O
harmed O
their O
families O
, O
they O
harmed O
their O
country O
. O

This O
is O
why O
they O
came O
back O
, O
and O
brought O
back O
a O
lot O
of O
information O
, O
which O
gave O
our O
security O
services O
huge O
capabilities O
in O
hunting O
the O
terrorists O
. O

And O
this O
operation O
will O
continue O
. O

And O
the O
awakening O
will O
continue O
, O
the O
awakening O
of O
our O
citizens O
opens O
for O
us O
a O
new O
horizon O
every O
day O
, O
they O
who O
were O
led O
astray O
by O
lies O
, O
religious O
slogans O
or O
political O
deceptions O
. O

And O
our O
guest O
, O
Azam B-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Ahmed I-PERSON
, O
Chairman O
of O
the B-ORG
Fatah I-ORG
Movement I-ORG
Parliament I-ORG
Bloc I-ORG
. O

Mr. O
Azam B-PERSON
Al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Ahmed I-PERSON
, O
at O
a O
time O
when O
the O
international O
community O
is O
actually O
demanding O
Hamas B-ORG
to O
recognize O
Israel B-GPE
and O
reject O
violence O
, O
we O
hear O
some O
of O
your O
colleagues O
actually O
criticizing O
Hamas B-ORG
, O
that O
its O
members O
have O
not O
fired O
one O
shot O
at O
the O
Israelis B-NORP
since O
the O
truce O
agreement O
. O

How O
ah O
I O
mean O
, O
can O
we O
reconcile O
these O
two O
subjects O
? O

I O
mean O
, O
maybe O
some O
statements O
are O
released O
inaccurately O
but O
amid O
ah O
the O
skirmishes O
and O
harassment O
, O
some O
statements O
come O
out O
, O
I O
mean O
ah O
that O
the O
only O
aim O
behind O
them O
in O
my O
estimation O
is O
harassment O
, O
not O
more O
than O
that O
. O

We O
say O
yes O
, O
Hamas B-ORG
was O
the O
regiment O
most O
committed O
to O
the O
truce O
that O
was O
announced O
in O
Cairo B-GPE
, O
and O
this O
is O
not O
at O
all O
a O
fault O
, O
but O
rather O
we O
rather O
respect O
this O
position O
. O

Ok O
, O
Mr. O
Azam B-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Ahmed I-PERSON
, O
from O
another O
perspective O
, O
ah O
as O
you O
know O
Fatah B-ORG
formed O
all O
, O
if O
not O
most O
, O
of O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
governments O
that O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
have O
existed O
since O
the B-LAW
Oslo I-LAW
Agreement I-LAW
; O
Fatah B-ORG
also O
complied O
with O
international O
standards O
, O
as O
foreign O
officials O
say O
. O

But O
what O
was O
the O
outcome O
of O
that O
? O

I O
mean O
, O
we O
signed O
an O
agreement O
as O
a B-ORG
Palestinian I-ORG
Liberation I-ORG
Organization I-ORG
and O
ah O
the O
governments O
committed O
by O
the O
successive O
, O
and O
by O
the O
way O
ah O
we O
were O
continuously O
, O
Fatah B-ORG
, O
inviting O
everyone O
to O
participate O
. O

Those O
who O
accepted O
participation O
, O
like O
the B-ORG
Al I-ORG
- I-ORG
Shaab I-ORG
Party I-ORG
, O
Feda B-ORG
, O
Popular B-ORG
Resistance I-ORG
Front I-ORG
, O
some O
of O
the O
independents O
and O
the B-ORG
Islamic I-ORG
Current I-ORG
, O
were O
always O
members O
of O
the O
government O
. O

The O
outcome O
: O
we O
signed O
a O
principle O
agreement O
for O
a O
three O
year O
period O
. O

Israel B-GPE
ah O
was O
setting O
up O
barriers O
. O

We O
succeeded O
first O
in O
establishing O
organizations O
, O
the O
nucleus O
of O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
entity O
on O
the O
land O
of O
Palestine B-GPE
, O
on O
the O
way O
to O
establishing O
the O
independent O
Palestinian B-NORP
state O
. O

Yes O
. O

About O
a O
quarter O
million O
Palestinians B-NORP
returned O
thanks O
to O
the O
agreement O
that O
was O
signed O
. O

And O
when O
Israel B-GPE
started O
to O
disclaim O
the O
agreements O
, O
we O
clashed O
with O
it O
and O
Sharon B-PERSON
, O
who O
actually O
opposed O
and O
is O
still O
opposing O
and O
his O
party O
still O
opposes O
the B-LAW
Oslo I-LAW
Agreement I-LAW
, O
won O
in O
the O
Knesset B-ORG
elections O
. O

Okay O
. O

And O
we O
entered O
a O
struggle O
since O
the O
year O
2000 B-DATE
till O
now O
, O
and O
before O
that O
the B-EVENT
Al I-EVENT
- I-EVENT
Nafaq I-EVENT
uprising I-EVENT
also O
, O
let O
us O
remember O
it O
well O
; O
this O
is O
why O
Yasser B-PERSON
Arafat I-PERSON
was O
put O
under O
siege O
and O
there O
was O
the B-EVENT
Al I-EVENT
- I-EVENT
Aqsa I-EVENT
Intifadah I-EVENT
and O
there O
was O
a O
re-invasion O
, O
because O
the O
struggle O
was O
renewed O
, O
because O
we O
refused O
ah O
to O
accept O
the O
Israeli B-NORP
dictates O
. O

Okay O
. O

Okay O
. O

We O
return O
again O
, O
our O
viewers O
, O
to O
our O
guest O
on O
today O
's O
episode O
, O
Dr. O
Khattar B-PERSON
Abu I-PERSON
Diab I-PERSON
. O

Uh O
, O
Dr. O
Khattar B-PERSON
, O
the B-ORG
New I-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
, O
uh O
, O
cites O
a O
neutral O
poll O
that O
indicates O
that O
, O
uh O
, O
the O
popularity O
of O
Abbas B-PERSON
is O
ahead O
of O
the O
popularity O
of O
Haniyeh B-PERSON
by O
at O
least O
six B-QUANTITY
points O
. O

Uh O
, O
in O
your O
opinion O
, O
does O
this O
justify O
the O
rejection O
by O
Hamas B-ORG
of O
Abbas B-PERSON
's O
call O
for O
early O
elections O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
Hamas B-ORG
's O
rejection O
is O
linked O
to O
the O
results O
of O
this O
poll O
or O
to O
its O
fear O
of O
its O
declining O
popularity O
. O

There O
is O
an O
impasse O
, O
which O
is O
the O
impasse O
of O
the B-ORG
Palestinian I-ORG
National I-ORG
Authority I-ORG
in O
itself O
. O

This O
Authority B-ORG
was O
built O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
agreements O
that O
have O
not O
been O
implemented O
. O

And O
the O
advent O
of O
the B-ORG
Hamas I-ORG
Movement I-ORG
came O
to O
add O
complexity O
to O
things O
because O
effectively O
, O
it O
did O
not O
recognize O
the O
framework O
through O
which O
it O
came O
to O
power O
. O

Also O
adding O
complexity O
to O
things O
is O
the O
American B-GPE
and O
British B-GPE
rejection O
of O
the B-ORG
Hamas I-ORG
Movement I-ORG
, O
i.e. O
there O
was O
a O
contradiction O
in O
supporting O
, O
for O
example O
, O
the O
Siniora B-ORG
government O
in O
Lebanon B-GPE
and O
not O
recognizing O
a O
democratically O
elected O
government O
in O
Palestine B-GPE
as O
well O
. O

And O
among O
the O
repercussions O
in O
the O
matter O
is O
the O
lack O
of O
clarity O
concerning O
a O
successor O
to O
Arafat B-PERSON
and O
the O
lack O
of O
clarity O
of O
the O
position O
within O
the B-ORG
Fatah I-ORG
Movement I-ORG
itself O
. O

All O
of O
this O
led O
to O
complicating O
the O
position O
in O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
arena O
, O
but O
we O
should O
not O
be O
surprised O
, O
because O
there O
is O
reshuffling O
in O
every O
national O
liberation O
movement O
. O

During O
the O
days O
of O
Arafat B-PERSON
, O
this O
reshuffling O
was O
long O
delayed O
, O
and O
now O
it O
is O
happening O
, O
but O
not O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
people O
. O

Yes O
. O

Because O
when O
this O
people O
is O
headed O
towards O
a O
civil O
war O
, O
neither O
Hamas B-ORG
leadership O
nor O
Fatah B-ORG
leadership O
is O
of O
use O
any O
longer O
; O
rather O
the O
gains O
that O
were O
achieved O
in O
the O
recent O
period O
may O
be O
threatened O
as O
a O
whole O
. O

Yes O
. O

Yes O
. O

Joining O
us O
from O
Paris B-GPE
is O
Abdul B-PERSON
Amir I-PERSON
Al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Rekaby I-PERSON
, O
the O
secretary O
general O
of O
the B-ORG
Iraqi I-ORG
National I-ORG
Democratic I-ORG
Current I-ORG
. O

Mr. O
Rekaby B-PERSON
, O
normally O
uh O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
uh O
, O
a O
prime O
minister O
does O
n't O
need O
to O
hold O
a O
press O
conference O
to O
declare O
his O
views O
, O
uh O
, O
uh O
, O
to O
make O
statements O
. O

Could O
it O
be O
said O
that O
uh O
, O
Mr. O
Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Maliki I-PERSON
's O
conference O
was O
a O
reaction O
perhaps O
to O
Abdul B-PERSON
Aziz I-PERSON
Al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Hakim I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
visit O
to O
Washington B-GPE
and O
the O
views O
expressed O
by O
Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Hakim I-PERSON
in O
this O
regard O
? O

No O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
there O
is O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
mean O
a O
split O
between O
Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Hakim I-PERSON
and O
Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Maliki I-PERSON
. O

Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Maliki I-PERSON
uh O
, O
is O
trying O
once O
again O
to O
say O
that O
he O
is O
doing O
something O
. O

The O
capabilities O
available O
to O
him O
are O
zero O
uh O
, O
as O
is O
already O
known O
, O
because O
this O
conference O
issue O
was O
previously O
proposed O
, O
but O
it O
failed O
. O

It O
did O
n't O
happen O
. O

And O
regional O
conferences O
and O
neighboring O
states O
' O
meeting O
are O
also O
held O
regularly O
, O
but O
have O
stopped O
lately O
, O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
this O
talk O
has O
any O
significance O
or O
political O
implication O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
major O
problem O
, O
whether O
for O
the O
Americans B-NORP
or O
for O
those O
leaders O
of O
the O
American B-NORP
political O
process O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
who O
are O
cooperating O
with O
them O
, O
is O
that O
they O
're O
going O
in O
circles O
in O
a O
vacuum O
. O

They O
're O
telling O
stories O
, O
which O
uh O
, O
uh O
, O
show O
that O
they O
want O
to O
evade O
real O
solutions O
, O
and O
they O
are O
stubborn O
; O
they O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
admit O
that O
their O
political O
process O
has O
reached O
a O
dead O
end O
, O
has O
collapsed O
, O
has O
ended O
, O
and O
uh O
, O
is O
worn O
away O
by O
time O
. O

Who O
is O
it O
that O
today O
wants O
to O
blow O
things O
up O
in O
Lebanon B-GPE
, O
Doctor O
? O

There O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
what O
is O
going O
on O
now O
is O
a O
repercussion O
of O
the B-EVENT
July I-EVENT
12th I-EVENT
War I-EVENT
. O

Uh O
, O
obviously O
, O
Israel B-GPE
has O
never O
in O
its O
history O
encountered O
, O
since O
it O
came O
into O
existence O
until O
today O
, O
a O
resistance O
like O
the O
resistance O
it O
met O
in O
this O
war O
. O

A O
slap O
in O
the O
face O
in O
return O
, O
that O
is O
. O

And O
to O
this O
day O
, O
we O
still O
hear O
the O
repercussions O
within O
Israel B-GPE
. O

Let O
me O
go O
back O
a O
little O
to O
the O
creation O
of O
Israel B-GPE
. O

Israel B-GPE
and O
the O
Arab B-NORP
countries O
have O
been O
close O
to O
each O
other O
during O
the O
time O
of O
their O
existence O
, O
about O
50 B-DATE
or I-DATE
60 I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

And O
during O
those O
years O
, O
Israel B-GPE
waged O
well O
coordinated O
wars O
, O
in O
which O
it O
was O
victorious O
because O
of O
the O
unlimited O
support O
it O
received O
from O
the O
superpowers O
. O

But O
what O
Israel B-GPE
did O
not O
fail O
to O
observe O
was O
that O
the O
societal O
war O
, O
if O
it O
were O
able O
to O
wage O
it O
and O
destroy O
Arab B-NORP
society O
from O
the O
inside O
, O
then O
it O
would O
have O
the O
final O
victory O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Because O
we O
are O
in O
civilized O
societies O
whose O
age O
goes O
back O
thousands B-DATE
of I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

Therefore O
, O
Israel B-GPE
understands O
this O
premise O
and O
it O
wants O
to O
dismantle O
societies O
from O
the O
inside O
. O

Therefore O
it O
resorts O
to O
sectarian O
strife O
, O
to O
religious O
incitement O
and O
to O
racial O
and O
ethnic O
strife O
and O
so O
on O
. O

This O
leads O
naturally O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
someone O
in O
Lebanon B-GPE
is O
working O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
Israeli B-NORP
interests O
, O
someone O
working O
for O
the O
interests O
of O
Israel B-GPE
. O

Of O
course O
, O
of O
course O
, O
of O
course O
, O
of O
course O
. O

they O
are O
the O
ones O
who O
are O
stirring O
up O
all O
these O
waves O
we O
are O
seeing O
at O
this O
stage O
. O

With O
me O
from O
Mogadishu B-GPE
is O
our O
correspondent O
Fahd B-PERSON

Fahd B-PERSON
, O
you O
are O
in O
Mogadishu B-GPE
; O
what O
's O
the O
latest O
information O
you O
have O
received O
so O
far O
? O

Uh O
, O
the O
latest O
information O
that O
we O
received O
so O
far O
is O
that O
these O
battles O
between O
the O
two O
sides O
, O
uh O
, O
started O
after O
the O
Friday B-DATE
prayers O
and O
they O
started O
exactly O
in O
a O
place O
known O
, O
a O
small O
village O
called O
Safar B-GPE
Nooley I-GPE
, O
said O
to O
be O
80 B-QUANTITY
kilometers O
away O
from O
Dinsor B-GPE
in O
the O
direction O
of O
Baidoa B-GPE
. O

Uh O
, O
however O
, O
the O
news O
from O
the O
transitional O
government O
says O
that O
the O
battles O
were O
actually O
in O
places O
close O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Dinsor B-GPE
. O

And O
the O
battles O
were O
very O
fierce O
and O
lasted O
more O
than O
two O
hours O
, O
uh O
, O
we O
had O
tried O
to O
communicate O
with O
the O
cities O
close O
to O
it O
, O
but O
because O
communications O
from O
that O
city O
were O
cut O
off O
for O
more O
than O
a O
week O
, O
it O
hindered O
uh O
, O
that O
we O
find O
detailed O
news O
or O
eyewitnesses O
in O
that B-GPE
city I-GPE
. O

Uh O
, O
but O
a O
short O
while O
ago O
, O
and O
according O
to O
a O
communication O
with O
one O
of O
the O
officials O
in O
the B-ORG
Islamic I-ORG
Courts I-ORG
, O
Mr. O
Mukhtar B-PERSON
Abu I-PERSON
Mansour I-PERSON
, O
who O
is O
the O
representative O
of O
the B-ORG
Security I-ORG
Office I-ORG
of I-ORG
the I-ORG
Islamic I-ORG
Courts I-ORG
, O
he O
says O
that O
the O
battle O
is O
over O
and O
that O
they O
were O
able O
to O
control O
, O
uh O
, O
that B-GPE
village I-GPE
. O

Uh O
, O
and O
we O
asked O
him O
, O
is O
it O
the O
city O
of O
Dinsor B-GPE
, O
that O
is O
, O
is O
any O
of O
the O
city O
of O
Dinsor B-GPE
in O
their O
hands O
? O

He O
added O
that O
this B-GPE
city I-GPE
is O
still O
in O
their O
hands O
, O
uh O
, O
but O
the O
transitional O
government O
side O
is O
still O
insisting O
that O
the O
battle O
is O
ongoing O
at O
this O
moment O
and O
that O
it O
is O
on O
the O
outskirts O
of O
the O
town O
of O
Dinsor B-GPE
. O

Fahd B-PERSON
, O
a O
few O
, O
uh O
, O
days O
ago O
also O
, O
uh O
, O
the O
situation O
was O
still O
the O
same O
and O
communications O
were O
cut O
off O
as O
they O
still O
are O
in O
Dinsor B-GPE
, O
uh O
, O
but O
at O
the O
time O
, O
the O
government O
said O
that O
it O
had O
regained O
control O
over O
it O
, O
and O
as O
a O
result O
, O
uh O
, O
this O
dispute O
could O
still O
be O
going O
on O
till O
now O
, O
each O
side O
saying O
that O
it O
has O
controlled O
it O
, O
right O
? O

This O
is O
true O
, O
because O
the O
problem O
in O
this B-GPE
city I-GPE
, O
uh O
, O
even O
the O
situation O
in O
Somalia B-GPE
, O
if O
such O
a O
war O
had O
occurred O
, O
the O
news O
would O
have O
reached O
us O
as O
fast O
as O
possible O
, O
but O
because O
communications O
are O
cut O
off O
from O
that B-GPE
city I-GPE
, O
uh O
, O
the O
news O
remains O
, O
because O
it O
is O
a O
marginal O
city O
given O
the O
location O
of O
the B-GPE
city I-GPE
. O

And O
so O
, O
uh O
, O
days O
ago O
, O
as O
you O
and O
I O
said O
, O
the O
government O
was O
saying O
it O
had O
recaptured O
, O
but O
today O
uh O
the O
situation O
happened O
again O
and O
the B-ORG
Islamic I-ORG
Courts I-ORG
and O
the O
forces O
of O
the O
transitional O
government O
are O
still O
fighting O
each O
other O
on O
the O
outskirts O
of O
the O
city O
, O
the O
city O
of O
Dinsor B-GPE
. O

Uh O
, O
but O
the B-ORG
Islamic I-ORG
Courts I-ORG
, O
as O
I O
told O
you O
, O
the O
battle O
is O
outside O
the O
city O
of O
Dinsor B-GPE
at O
a O
distance O
of O
40 B-QUANTITY
kilometers O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
the O

Mr. O
Samir B-PERSON
, O
I O

from O
our O
viewing O
, O
uh O
, O
this O
report O
, O
we O
saw O
that O
, O
uh O
, O
Le B-ORG
Point I-ORG
magazine O
, O
Paris B-ORG
Match I-ORG
and O
L'Express B-ORG
sort O
of O
focused O
on O
a O
single O
issue O
, O
uh O
, O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
assassination O
, O
uh O
, O
of O
the O
young O
minister O
and O
MP O
Pierre B-PERSON
Gemayel I-PERSON
. O

Uh O
, O
how O
do O
you O
see O
the O
points O
of O
similarity O
that O
, O
uh O
, O
were O
made O
, O
uh O
, O
by O
Le B-ORG
Point I-ORG
between O
the O
Kennedy B-PERSON
family O
and O
Gemayel B-PERSON
family O
? O

There O
is O
an O
error O
reported O
by O
Le B-ORG
Point I-ORG
, O
uh O
, O
not O
a O
minor O
one O
, O
which O
is O
that O
Pierre B-PERSON
Gemayel I-PERSON
the O
grandfather O
was O
assassinated O
. O

The O
fact O
is O
that O
he O
died O
I O
mean O
, O
when O
his O
time O
came O
, O
his O
time O
, O
a O
natural O
death O
. O

but O
there O
are O
some O
members O
of O
the O
Gemayel B-PERSON
family O
and O
their O
in-laws O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
that O
is O
the O
Aswad B-PERSON
family O
, O
were O
assassinated O
under O
circumstances O
we O
all O
know O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
sad O
thing O
in O
this O
matter O
is O
that O
not O
only O
the O
Gemayel B-PERSON
family O
has O
this O
similarity O
with O
the O
Kennedys B-PERSON
; O
there O
are O
many O
families O
in O
Lebanon B-GPE
that O
have O
lost O
the O
father O
and O
the O
grandfather O
and O
sometimes O
the O
grandson O
, O
including O
the O
Jumblatts B-PERSON
, O
including O
the O
Chamouns B-PERSON
and O
others O
. O

Yes O
. O

And O
to O
the O
slip O
of O
the O
tongue O
that O
was O
made O
by O
Ehud B-PERSON
Olmert I-PERSON
, O
in O
which O
he O
admitted O
that O
the O
Israeli B-NORP
entity O
has O
nuclear O
weapons O
. O

This O
interview O
was O
in O
Germany B-GPE
with O
German B-NORP
television O
. O

But O
stranger O
than O
that O
was O
the O
reply O
to O
him O
by O
Mordechai B-PERSON
Vanunu I-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
detained O
for O
several O
years O
after O
he O
revealed O
the O
secrets O
of O
the O
nuclear O
weapons O
inside O
the O
Israeli B-NORP
entity O
. O

Vanunu B-PERSON
said O
that O
the O
whole O
world O
knows O
about O
what O
Ehud B-PERSON
Olmert I-PERSON
declared O
. O

And O
in O
any O
case O
, O
specifically O
Roni B-PERSON
Shaked I-PERSON
wrote O
, O
I O
was O
not O
surprised O
by O
Olmert B-PERSON
's O
statements O
. O

The O
entire O
world O
knows O
that O
Israel B-GPE
has O
nuclear O
weapons O
. O

It O
was O
necessary O
for O
a O
person O
with O
an O
official O
capacity O
in O
Israel B-GPE
to O
stand O
up O
and O
say O
that O
, O
and O
Olmert B-PERSON
said O
that O
yesterday O
, O

That O
was O
the O
response O
of O
the O
nuclear O
spy O
Mordechai B-PERSON
Vanunu I-PERSON
to O
the O
slip O
of O
the O
tongue O
by O
Olmert B-PERSON
. O

Vanunu B-PERSON
gave O
an O
interview O
yesterday O
with O
the O
Al B-ORG
- I-ORG
Ayyam I-ORG
Palestinian B-NORP
newspaper O
that O
is O
published O
in O
Ramallah B-GPE
. O

The O
former O
spy O
said O
: O
Years O
ago O
, O
I O
spoke O
about O
the O
nuclear O
weapons O
that O
Israel B-GPE
possesses O
, O
after O
I B-GPE
had O
spoken O
, O
Israel B-GPE
was O
obliged O
to O
admit O
that O
it O
possessed O
nuclear O
weapons O
. O

I O
hope O
now O
, O
and O
in O
the O
aftermath O
of O
the O
statements O
by O
the O
prime O
minister O
, O
that O
Israel B-GPE
will O
change O
its O
policy O
. O

Mr. O
Ahmad B-PERSON
Rafiq I-PERSON
, O
I O
mean O
, O
uh O
, O
uh O
, O
Vanunu B-PERSON
says O
that O
as O
you O
noticed O
, O
it O
is O
trying O
to O
make O
it O
look O
as O
though O
Olmert B-PERSON
broke O
the O
taboo O
, O
but O
Vanunu B-PERSON
says O
that O
this O
is O
incorrect O
, O
that O
the O
whole O
world O
knows O
that O
the O
Israeli B-NORP
entity O
possess O
nuclear O
weapons O
. O

Mr. O
Abdel B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
, O
I O
mean O
, O
today O
, O
after O
the O
bombing O
that O
occurred O
at O
Al B-FAC
- I-FAC
Tayaran I-FAC
Square I-FAC
leaving O
dozens O
of O
innocent O
civilians O
victims O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
Mr. O
Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Maliki I-PERSON
issued O
a O
statement O
and O
said O
that O
the O
terrorists O
and O
the O
Takfiris B-NORP
and O
their O
Saddamist B-NORP
allies O
are O
behind O
this O
crime O
and O
most O
of O
the O
crimes O
that O
take O
place O
, O
which O
target O
Iraqi B-NORP
citizens O
daily O
in O
the O
capital O
and O
the O
other O
governorates O
. O

He O
also O
said O
that O
it O
reveals O
that O
the O
terrorist O
groups O
that O
stand O
behind O
it O
seek O
to O
spread O
the O
anarchy O
of O
killing O
and O
crime O
and O
to O
drag O
Iraq B-GPE
into O
the O
crucible O
of O
war O
and O
sectarian O
sedition O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
there O
were O
indications O
that O
the O
conference O
, O
the O
National O
Reconciliation O
Conference O
, O
would O
pave O
the O
way O
for O
a O
national O
dialogue O
with O
some O
of O
the O
armed O
groups O
. O

First O
, O
do O
you O
expect O
that O
the O
Conference O
will O
meet O
the O
demands O
of O
these O
groups O
? O

The O
truth O
is O
, O
when O
the O
objective O
is O
either O
I O
rule O
over O
you O
or O
I O
kill O
you O
, O
or O
the O
objective O
is O
either O
I O
take O
hold O
of O
everything O
I O
can O
without O
consideration O
of O
national O
interests O
, O
or O
without O
consideration O
, O
uh O
, O
of O
the O
complexities O
of O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
circumstances O
, O
then O
, O
in O
reality O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
think O
that O
continuing O
in O
this O
situation O
wo O
n't O
change O
anything O
in O
the O
reality O
of O
situation O
, O
uh O
, O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

The O
issue O
is O
, O
either O
there O
is O
a O
sincere O
patriotic O
intention O
to O
transcend O
this O
situation O
towards O
a O
better O
situation O
, O
transcend O
, O
uh O
, O
the O
phase O
of O
dictatorship O
that O
Iraq B-GPE
experienced O
, O
then O
the O
phase O
of O
the O
mistakes O
of O
the O
American B-NORP
occupation O
whose O
price O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
people O
are O
paying O
. O

Actually O
, O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
people O
are O
paying O
for O
mistakes O
they O
have O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
. O

A O
representative O
in O
the B-ORG
Iraqi I-ORG
Parliament I-ORG
and O
a O
leader O
in O
the O
al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Sadr I-PERSON
current O
, O
Mr. O
Salam B-PERSON
. O

First O
ah O
as O
we O
know O
that O
Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Sadr I-PERSON
current O
had O
announced O
the O
suspension O
of O
its O
participation O
in O
the O
government O
and O
the O
parliament O
in O
opposition O
to O
the O
meeting O
of O
Bush B-PERSON
and O
Al B-PERSON
Maliki I-PERSON
, O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
Prime O
Minister O
. O

This O
is O
not O
the O
first O
time O
an O
Iraqi B-NORP
Prime O
Minister O
has O
met O
with O
President O
Bush B-PERSON
, O
right O
? O

In O
the O
Name O
of O
Allah O
, O
the O
Most O
Beneficent O
, O
the O
Most O
Merciful O
. O

Naturally O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
ah O
it O
is O
going O
through O
a O
crisis O
and O
dangerous O
escalation O
in O
acts O
of O
violence O
and O
terrorism O
. O

believes O
that O
all O
these O
acts O
of O
violence O
or O
what O
is O
going O
on O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
and O
the O
deterioration O
of O
the O
situation O
, O
that O
the O
reason O
for O
that O
is O
the O
occupation O
forces O
. O

So O
, O
when O
the O
Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Sadr I-PERSON
current O
opposed O
ah O
ah O
the O
meeting O
of O
Mr. O
Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Maliki I-PERSON
with O
Bush B-PERSON
, O
considering O
the O
Americans B-NORP
are O
responsible O
, O
a O
direct O
responsibility O
, O
for O
what O
is O
happening O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

That O
is O
why O
there O
should O
be O
a O
strong O
position O
from O
the O
government O
, O
in O
which O
it O
demands O
ah O
receiving O
the O
security O
dossier O
and O
controlling O
the O
security O
situation O
in O
order O
to O
stop O
the O
bloodshed O
and O
to O
avoid O
continuing O
this O
blood O
- O
letting O
. O

Once O
again O
, O
did O
this O
responsibility O
come O
up O
now O
, O
as O
you O
say O
the O
responsibility O
of O
the O
Americans B-NORP
for O
what O
is O
happening O
, O
or O
was O
it O
the O
reason O
in O
the O
past O
, O
for O
example O
, O
Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Ja'fari I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
government O
Prime O
Minister O
Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Ja'fari I-PERSON
, O
to O
be O
in O
this O
government O
, O
he O
met O
with O
Bush B-PERSON
, O
it O
did O
not O
cause O
any O
fuss O
? O

Certainly O
, O
certainly O
, O
but O
now O
things O
started O
to O
get O
more O
dangerous O
and O
to O
get O
more O
heated O
, O
and O
the O
security O
situations O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
started O
to O
deteriorate O
bit O
by O
bit O
, O
so O
actually O
we O
have O
reached O
a O
stage O
the O
street O
would O
not O
be O
able O
to O
handle O
what O
is O
going O
on O
. O

So O
, O
we O
said O
that O
there O
should O
be O
an O
earnest O
and O
effective O
step O
from O
the O
government O
to O
receive O
the O
security O
dossier O
, O
because O
the O
situation O
of O
the O
dead O
and O
the O
situation O
of O
what O
is O
happening O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
has O
become O
a O
terrifying O
and O
very O
frightening O
situation O
. O

Yes O
. O

Ok O
. O

Mr. O
Salam B-PERSON
, O
personally O
, O
do O
you O
consider O
this O
step O
successful O
? O

Definitely O
, O
it O
is O
ah O
a O
political O
justification O
, O
or O
a O
political O
position O
that O
the O
Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Sadr I-PERSON
current O
adopted O
, O
I O
hope O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
that O
there O
would O
be O
a O
round O
of O
dialogue O
between O
ah O
the O
political O
powers O
and O
the O
government O
in O
order O
to O
coordinate O
the O
position O
before O
announcing O
it O
. O

Ah O
we O
hope O
the O
government O
has O
a O
strong O
position O
and O
I O
mean O
, O
a O
strong O
will O
in O
stabilizing O
the O
security O
dossier O
, O
and O
through O
dialogue O
with O
the O
Americans B-NORP
; O
so O
the O
position O
of O
the O
Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Sadr I-PERSON
current O
, O
is O
a O
political O
position O
. O

Ok O
. O

Ok O
, O
Bush B-PERSON
did O
not O
only O
meet O
with O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
, O
but O
he O
also O
met O
with O
Abd B-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Aziz I-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Hakim I-PERSON
, O
one O
of O
the O
senior O
Shiite B-NORP
leaders O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
, O
as O
you O
know O
. O

Are O
you O
going O
to O
apply O
the O
same O
thing O
you O
did O
with O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
to O
Bush B-PERSON
's O
meeting O
with O
Abd B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
al I-PERSON
Aziz I-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Hakim I-PERSON
? O

No O
, O
naturally O
, O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Council I-ORG
has O
its O
own O
policy O
, O
and O
I O
believe O
it O
is O
a O
party O
that O
has O
its O
political O
plan O
. O

As O
for O
the O
government O
, O
it O
is O
responsible O
for O
the O
security O
of O
Iraq B-GPE
as O
a O
whole O
; O
so O
when O
the O
Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Sadr I-PERSON
current O
announced O
its O
position O
, O
it O
was O
asking O
the O
government O
to O
have O
the O
power O
in O
controlling O
the O
security O
situation O
, O
and O
it O
has O
the O
bigger O
role O
in O
receiving O
the O
security O
dossier O
. O

So O
, O
we O
also O
gave O
ah O
I O
mean O
ah O
power O
and O
support O
to O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
in O
order O
to O
demand O
to O
receive O
the O
file O
, O
as O
the O
street O
is O
now O
congested O
and O
does O
not O
want O
to O
continue O
in O
that O
situation O
. O

You O
are O
belittling O
in O
this O
case O
the O
influence O
of O
Abd B-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Aziz I-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Hakim I-PERSON
, O
I O
mean O
, O
you O
say O
he O
has O
no O
importance O
compared O
to O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
, O
right O
? O

No O
, O
certainly O
Abd B-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Aziz I-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Hakim I-PERSON
is O
a O
political O
man O
, O
who O
has O
his O
political O
project O
, O
but O
we O
are O
demanding O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
, O
he O
has O
the O
bigger O
authority O
in O
the O
administration O
of O
Iraq B-GPE
as O
a O
whole O
, O
but O
Mr. O
Abd B-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Aziz I-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Hakim I-PERSON
is O
a O
contributing O
party O
in O
the O
political O
process O
, O
and O
he O
has O
his O
political O
role O
. O

Ok O
. O

Abd B-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Aziz I-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Hakim I-PERSON
, O
I O
mean O
, O
you O
want O
to O
say O
, O
has O
his O
political O
program O
; O
his O
political O
program O
is O
different O
from O
your O
program O
? O

Definitely O
, O
we O
disagree O
with O
the O
brothers O
in O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Council I-ORG
with O
our O
political O
project O
, O
we O
have O
a O
project O
of O
resistance O
, O
reform O
and O
change O
. O

They O
have O
a O
project O
of O
the O
Americans B-NORP
. O

They O
do O
not O
have O
a O
project O
of O
change O
and O
reform O
, O
you O
say O
? O

No O
, O
no O
, O
not O
change O
and O
reform O
, O
but O
they O
do O
not O
believe O
in O
resistance O
at O
the O
time O
being O
, O
and O
so O
they O
entered O
the O
political O
process O
from O
its O
beginning O
, O
before O
the O
fall O
of O
the O
regime O
. O

And O
there O
were O
rounds O
of O
dialogue O
between O
them O
and O
the O
Americans B-NORP
, O
and O
you O
know O
where O
the O
mistake O
is O
, O
but O
we O
do O
not O
want O
to O
engage O
in O
dialogue O
with O
the O
Americans B-NORP
we O
did O
not O
believe O
in O
the O
political O
process O
from O
the O
beginning O
; O
we O
hold O
the O
occupation O
accountable O
for O
what O
is O
happening O
. O

Yes O
. O

Well O
, O
the O
latest O
information O
is O
that O
there O
is O
a O
problem O
in O
the O
area O
of O
Arab B-NORP
Al B-LOC
- I-LOC
Barbir I-LOC
neighborhood I-LOC
, O
uh O
, O
about O
50 B-QUANTITY
people O
entered O
the O
area O
who O
were O
apparently O
returning O
from O
the O
sit O
- O
in O
or O
going O
to O
it O
, O
to O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

And O
there O
were O
problems O
that O
occurred O
in O
the O
beginning O
with O
the O
residents O
and O
with O
, O
and O
there O
was O
smashing O
of O
cars O
but O
the O
army O
arrived O
on O
the O
scene O
and O
it O
seems O
that O
at O
that O
moment O
, O
it O
began O
controlling O
the O
situation O
. O

Yes O
, O
but O
the O
opposition O
is O
accusing O
you O
that O
you O
are O
provoking O
those O
demonstrators O
; O
how O
do O
you O
respond O
? O

I O
mean O
, O
do O
you O
have O
according O
to O
the O
investigations O
any O
information O
, O
especially O
about O
the O
victim O
who O
was O
killed O
yesterday O
in O
the B-LOC
Qasqas I-LOC
area I-LOC
? O

with O
respect O
to O
the O
victim O
may O
God O
bless O
his O
soul O
, O
the O
prime O
minister O
was O
with O
him O
, O
uh O
, O
and O
he O
was O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
a O
victim O
of O
all O
that O
is O
happening O
and O
a O
victim O
of O
all O
Lebanon B-GPE
, O
uh O
, O
and O
consequently O
, O
uh O
, O
there O
is O
a O
military O
investigation O
being O
conducted O
by O
the O
military O
court O
and O
those O
details O
of O
the O
investigation O
are O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
military O
judiciary O
and O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
Lebanese B-NORP
army O
with O
everyone O
. O

there O
is O
no O
doubt O
about O
that O
subject O
. O

Uh O
, O
there O
are O
also O
no O
details O
, O
the O
site O
of O
the O
shooting O
, O
it O
seems O
that O
it O
came O
from O
a O
remote O
unidentified O
direction O
, O
uh O
, O
and O
specifically O
no O
one O
can O
level O
an O
accusation O
at O
any O
group O
. O

And O
unfortunately O
, O
what O
was O
said O
on O
Al B-ORG
- I-ORG
Manar I-ORG
station O
that O
the O
militia O
, O
uh O
, O
of O
the O
Future O
, O
first O
of O
all O
we O
have O
no O
militia O
and O
no O
gunmen O
, O
and O
we O
in O
the B-ORG
Future I-ORG
Movement I-ORG
have O
never O
used O
weapons O
or O
given O
weapons O
to O
anyone O
. O

And O
everyone O
knows O
that O
, O
and O
there O
is O
one O
armed O
party O
in O
all O
this O
mess O
, O
uh O
, O
in O
the O
Lebanese B-NORP
interior O
. O

in O
regard O
to O
the O
provocations O
, O
this O
is O
a O
strange O
and O
amazing O
thing O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
if O
we O
take O
the O
outcome O
from O
the O
clashes O
that O
took O
place O
, O
uh O
, O
over O
the O
past O
24 B-TIME
hours I-TIME
, O
especially O
yesterday B-TIME
evening I-TIME
, O
we O
see O
where O
they O
take O
place O
and O
who O
suffers O
the O
damage O
, O
we O
discover O
uh O
, O
that O
they O
occur O
more O
in O
the O
regions O
with O
a O
majority O
belonging O
to O
the B-ORG
Future I-ORG
Movement I-ORG
politically O
or O
to O
March B-DATE
14 I-DATE
, O
and O
not O
in O
the O
regions O
that O
are O
affiliated O
with O
any O
of O
, O
uh O
, O
the O
March B-DATE
8 I-DATE
followers O
. O

Therefore O
, O
it O
is O
clear O
who O
is O
making O
these O
provocations O
and O
who O
causes O
the O
damage O
. O

There O
is O
no O
decision O
; O
it O
seems O
that O
taking O
to O
the O
street O
is O
not O
as O
safe O
as O
it O
has O
been O
announced O
. O

Yes O

The B-ORG

to O
examine O
the O
Iranian B-NORP
request O

Diplomats O
said O
that O
most O
Western B-LOC
and O
developing O
countries O
in O
the O
Agency B-ORG
have O
temporarily O
agreed O
to O
freeze O
the O
Iranian B-NORP
request O
, O
because O
of O
fears O
that O
it O
might O
result O
in O
the O
subsequent O
production O
of O
plutonium O
; O
this O
in O
response O
to O
the O
fears O
of O
the O
developing O
countries O
that O
this O
will O
set O
a O
precedent O
to O
deprive O
technical O
assistance O
to O
the O
peaceful O
nuclear O
energy O
programs O
of O
these O
countries O
. O

Seven B-QUANTITY
other O
requests O
submitted O
by O
Tehran B-GPE
are O
seen O
as O
not O
constituting O
any O
risk O
for O
the O
proliferation O
of O
atomic O
bombs O
, O
since O
they O
basically O
address O
the O
medical O
and O
civilian O
aspects O
of O
atomic O
energy O
, O
and O
which O
most O
members O
of O
the B-ORG
Board I-ORG
of I-ORG
Governors I-ORG
are O
convinced O
will O
not O
increase O
Iran B-GPE

capacity O
to O
enrich O
uranium O
and O
recycle O
the O
spent O

to O

The O
construction O
of O
the B-FAC

reactor I-FAC
, O
which O
operates O
with O
heavy O
water O
, O
and O
for O
which O
Tehran B-GPE
is O
requesting O
technical O
assistance O
from O
the B-ORG
International I-ORG
Atomic I-ORG
Energy I-ORG
Agency I-ORG
pertaining O
to O
radiation O
safety O
measures O

will O
be O
the O
focus O
of O
the O
Agency B-ORG

meeting O
today O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
fear O
of O
Western B-LOC
countries O
, O
particularly O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
of I-GPE
America I-GPE
, O
that O
Iran B-GPE
might O
use O
this O
reactor O
to O
produce O
plutonium O
to O
make O
nuclear O
weapons O
, O

noting O
that O
Tehran B-GPE
must O
not O
receive O
special O
assistance O
on O
the O
Arak B-FAC
project O
. O

Joining O
us O
from O
Gaza B-GPE
is O
Nemer O
Hammad B-PERSON
, O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
President O
's O
Political O
Affairs O
Advisor O
. O

Sir O
, O
uh O
, O
to O
begin O
with O
, O
uh O
, O
to O
the O
observer O
of O
Palestinian B-NORP
affairs O
and O
Palestinian B-NORP
statements O
, O
things O
may O
appear O
somewhat O
ambiguous O
. O

At O
times O
, O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
President O
announces O
that O
these O
consultations O
have O
reached O
an O
impasse O
, O
and O
at O
other O
times O
he O
says O
that O
the O
situation O
has O
hope O
in O
, O
uh O
, O
reaching O
a O
solution O
for O
this O
government O
. O

And O
Erekat B-PERSON
today O
confirms O
that O
the O
current O
government O
may O
be O
one O
of O
the O
options O
proposed O
to O
President O
Abbas B-PERSON
. O

What O
is O
the O
truth O
of O
the O
matter O
? O

Well O
, O
the O
fact O
is O
that O
everyone O
knows O
that O
there O
have O
been O
times O
and O
moments O
where O
there O
was O
really O
great O
optimism O
of O
possibly O
reaching O
an O
agreement O
. O

Then O
some O
problems O
appeared O
, O
which O
are O
not O
a O
secret O
either O
, O
and O
I O
can O
say O
them O
clearly O
. O

So O
the O
brothers O
in O
Hamas B-ORG
put O
forth O
the O
issue O
that O
, O
uh O
, O
the O
essential O
portfolios O
must O
not O
be O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
independents O
, O
and O
that O
this O
would O
be O
an O
insult O
to O
the O
leaders O
of O
the O
factions O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
this O
was O
a O
surprise O
. O

Historically O
, O
as O
an O
example O
, O
the O
first O
Finance O
Minister O
in O
the O
Authority B-ORG
was O
brother O
Muhammad B-PERSON
Zuhdi I-PERSON
Al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Nashashibi I-PERSON
, O
and O
he O
is O
an O
independent O
. O

The O
first O
Palestinian B-NORP
Interior O
Minister O
to O
be O
appointed O
, O
uh O
, O
was O
Major O
General O
Abdel B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Razzaq I-PERSON
Al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Yahya I-PERSON
, O
and O
he O
is O
an O
independent O
. O

So O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
problems O
that O
surfaced O
. O

Yet O
another O
problem O
surfaced O
and O
it O
was O
a O
surprise O
, O
and O
now O
it O
is O
being O
repeated O
in O
the O
statements O
of O
some O
of O
the O
brothers O
in O
the O
Hamas B-ORG
leadership O
, O
which O
is O
that O
the O
appointment O
letter O
by O
the O
president O
and O
the B-LAW
National I-LAW
Reconciliation I-LAW
document I-LAW
I O
mean O
are O
not O
sufficient O
in O
order O
, O
uh O
, O
for O
the O
government O
to O
obtain O
the O
vote O
of O
confidence O
. O

Um O
. O

The O
government O
receives O
encouragement O
from O
the B-ORG
Legislative I-ORG
Council I-ORG
, O
thus O
it O
becomes O
effective O
as O
if O
the O
appointment O
letter O
and O
the B-LAW
National I-LAW
Reconciliation I-LAW
document I-LAW
or O
the O
prisoners O
are O
worthless O
. O

The O
problems O
exist O
. O

Yes O
. O

They O
exist O
under O
an O
economic O
and O
financial O
siege O
, O
and O
also O
a O
political O
siege O
. O

Okay O
, O
speaking O
about O
this O
economic O
and O
financial O
siege O
, O
today O
Abbas B-PERSON
said O
that O
we O
want O
a O
government O
capable O
of O
lifting O
the O
siege O
now O
with O
these O
efforts O
that O
have O
resulted O
so O
far O
in O
a O
kind O
of O
, O
uh O
, O
untangling O
, O
uh O
, O
of O
some O
of O
, O
uh O
, O
these O
difficulties O
that O
have O
befallen O
or O
or O
are O
facing O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
people O
. O

There O
is O
a O
Qatari B-NORP
initiative O
to O
pay O
the O
salaries O
of O
some O
employees O
in O
uh O
, O
Palestine B-GPE

On O

First O
, O
I O
begin O
with O
Mr. O
Ahmed B-PERSON
Karim I-PERSON
from O
Sofia B-GPE
. O

Mr. O
Ahmed B-PERSON
, O
welcome O
to O
you O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
this O
huge O
amount O
of O
reactions O
to O
a O
judicial O
decision O
from O
a O
Libyan B-NORP
court O
, O
is O
it O
normal O
in O
your O
opinion O
? O

Ah O
, O
I O
do O
not O
believe O
that O
all O
of O
what O
is O
happening O
in O
the O
Arab B-NORP
world O
and O
the O
Islamic B-NORP
world O
, O
even O
if O
it O
is O
normal O
, O
it O
is O
normal O
for O
the O
West B-LOC
, O
especially O
the O
Zionist B-NORP
fronts O
that O
are O
waiting O
to O
provoke O
whatever O
issue O
and O
exploit O
it O
against O
the O
Arabs B-NORP
and O
against O
Muslims B-NORP
in O
general O
. O

Em O
. O

So O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
the O
trial O
going O
on O
now O
once O
again O
for O
those O
accused O
of O
killing O
tens O
of O
children O
of O
Libyan B-NORP
brothers O
is O
a O
crime O
that O
can O
not O
be O
discussed O
in O
any O
other O
way O
, O
and O
calling O
it O
a O
crime O
, O
an O
ugly O
and O
mass O
crime O
. O

Yes O
. O

But O
, O
there O
are O
many O
sides O
to O
every O
issue O
, O
as O
you O
mentioned O
. O

Yes O
. O

On O
the O
judicial O
side O
, O
if O
the O
judiciary O
reached O
a O
total O
conviction O
and O
after O
thorough O
checking O
and O
scrutiny O
, O
uh O
, O
that O
this O
crime O
was O
committed O
deliberately O
and O
on O
purpose O
and O
was O
premeditated O
, O
then O
the O
judiciary O
would O
have O
its O
final O
word O
in O
this O
issue O
and O
they O
deserve O
what O
they O
deserve O
. O

As O
I O
take O
the O
other O
side O
of O
this O
issue O
and O
its O
reactions O
, O
as O
I O
mentioned O
, O
to O
the O
world O
, O
it O
is O
normal O
that O
it O
caused O
a O
turmoil O
and O
a O
turmoil O
especially O
in O
Bulgaria B-GPE
and O
the O
countries O
of O
the O
world O
in O
particular O
, O
until O
the O
US B-NORP
Secretary O
of O
State O
, O
Condoleezza B-PERSON
Rice I-PERSON
, O
tackled O
the O
issue O
. O

Yes O
, O
as O
we O
mentioned O
before O
, O
yes O
, O
yes O
. O

Em O
. O

And O
also O
, O
she O
condemned O
this O
issue O
and O
considered O
it O
as O
an O
inhuman O
act O
. O

But O
she O
did O
not O
refer O
to O
the O
other O
side O
, O
the O
victims O
among O
the O
innocent O
children O
, O
that O
is O
a O
crime O
against O
all O
laws O
and O
divine O
-- O
as O
well O
as O
earthly O
-- O
norms O
. O

Em O
. O

Following O
the O
loss O
of O
the B-ORG
Republican I-ORG
Party I-ORG
led O
by O
US B-NORP
President O
George B-PERSON
Bush I-PERSON
in O
the O
midterm O
congressional B-ORG
elections O
, O
which O
were O
considered O
a O
referendum O
on O
US B-NORP
involvement O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
, O
came O
the O
Study B-ORG
Group I-ORG
report O
on O
US B-NORP
policy O
options O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
, O
which O
is O
co-chaired O
by O
former O
Secretary O

James B-PERSON
Baker I-PERSON
, O
a O
Republican B-NORP
, O
and O
former O
Congressman O
Lee B-PERSON
Hamilton I-PERSON
, O
a O
Democrat B-NORP
. O

It O
is O
assumed O
that O
this O
report O
, O
drawn O
up O
by O
the O
group O
composed O
of O
five B-CARDINAL
Democrats B-NORP
and O
five B-CARDINAL
Republicans B-NORP
, O
will O
serve O
as O
a O
political O
cover O
for O
US B-NORP
President O
George B-PERSON
Bush I-PERSON
to O
reconsider O
his O
policy O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
at O
a O
time O
when O
security O
chaos O
is O
on O
the O
rise O
in O
the O
country O
. O

Although O
the O
group O
's O
work O
was O
entirely O
confidential O
, O
leaks O
published O
by O
the O
New B-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
newspaper O
said O
that O
the O
group O
agreed O
on O
the O
need O
for O
a O
regional O
conference O
including O
Iraq B-GPE
's O
neighboring O
countries O
to O
discuss O
means O
of O
putting O
an O
end O
to O
the O
violence O
in O
the O
country O
. O
As O
well O
as O
to O
urge O
Bush B-PERSON
to O
abandon O
his O
reservations O
regarding O
talks O
with O
Iran B-GPE
and O
Syria B-GPE
, O
who O
neighbor O
this O
country O
. O

Despite O
the O
group O
's O
division O
on O
the O
issue O
of O
setting O
a O
timetable O
for O
the O
withdrawal O
of O
US B-NORP
occupation O
forces O
from O
Iraq B-GPE
, O
Democrat B-NORP
Senator O
Jack B-PERSON
Reed I-PERSON
expressed O
his O
belief O
that O
the O
group O
may O
reach O
an O
agreement O
to O
provide O
general O
recommendations O
rather O
than O
specific O
ones O
in O
this O
regard O
. O

The B-ORG
New I-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
said O
that O
the O
group O
defined O
its O
mission O
as O
providing O
the B-GPE
US I-GPE
government I-GPE
with O
proposed O
solutions O
to O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
situation O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
this O
article O
reminds O
me O
also O
, O
doctor O
, O
of O
one O
of O
the O
articles O
that O
was O
mentioned O
with O
us O
in O
the O
program O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
uh O
, O
where O
it O
indicated O
that O
dividing O
the O
region O
after O
the B-EVENT
Second I-EVENT
World I-EVENT
War I-EVENT
was O
not O
successful O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
we O
are O
witnessing O
today O
the O
repercussions O
of O
this O
division O
, O
which O
did O
not O
take O
into O
consideration O
sectarian O
geography O
, O
if O
the O
expression O
is O
right O
. O

What O
is O
your O
comment O
? O

The O
reality O
is O
that O
the O
Sykes B-PERSON
- O
Picot B-PERSON
case O
, O
at O
that O
time O
, O
when O
it O
was O
set O
, O
only O
paid O
attention O
to O
the O
interests O
of O
the O
countries O
and O
the O
outcome O
, O
ah O
, O
uh O
, O
the O
balance O
of O
power O
among O
them O
, O
that O
is O
, O
between O
France B-GPE
in O
the O
first O
place O
and O
Britain B-GPE
or O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
Kingdom I-GPE
. O

But O
now O
, O
we O
see O
that O
there O
are O
divisions O
being O
confirmed O
inside O
the O
Arab B-NORP
countries O
. O

In O
reality O
, O
they O
serve O
the O
main O
, O
Israeli B-NORP
goal O
, O
which O
is O
to O
change O
the O
region O
into O
, O
ah O
, O
a O
mosaic O
of O
small O
countries O
based O
on O
denominational O
thinking O
, O
religious O
thinking O
, O
or O
sectarian O
thinking O
. O

Yes O
. O

So O
we O
see O
that O
what O
is O
happening O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
, O
in O
reality O
, O
ah O
, O
under O
the O
sights O
of O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
, O
which O
is O
-- O
occupying O
Iraq B-GPE
; O
we O
see O
that O
Iraq B-GPE
might O
actually O
be O
divided O
into O
three O
districts O
, O
ah O
these O
areas O
agree O
to O
a O
great O
extent O
with O
the O
idea O
of O
sectarianism O
and O
factionism O
existing O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
. O

And O
if O
%pw O
-- O

Go O
ahead O
, O
in O
brief O
, O
please O
. O

Ah O
, O
no O
, O
I O
want O
to O
say O
that O
this O
tendency O
, O
there O
are O
efforts O
to O
expand O
it O
and O
generalize O
it O
in O
the O
region O
, O
or O
what O
is O
sometimes O
called O
Balkanizing O
the O
region O
like O
what O
happened O
, O
uh O
, O
after O
the O
collapse O
of O
the B-GPE
Soviet I-GPE
Union I-GPE
and O
the O
collapse O
of O
socialism O
in O
some O
countries O
of O
Western B-LOC
Europe I-LOC

Yes O
. O

This O
is O
clear O
, O
thank O
you O
so O
much O

Dr. O

Mr. O

Alfa I-PERSON
, O
well O
, O
despite O
all O
that O
went O
on O
in O
Lebanon B-GPE
today O
, O
there O
is O
still O
some O
hope O
pinned O
, O
in O
some O
way O
or O
another O
, O
on O
Speaker O
Nabih B-PERSON
Berri I-PERSON
to O
play O
a O
certain O
role O
towards O
resolution O
, O
towards O
returning O
to O
the O

, O
and O
so O
forth O
. O

Can O
Speaker O
Nabih B-PERSON
Berri I-PERSON
today O
take O
some O
sort O
of O
step O
? O

I O
mean O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
could O
an O
attractive O
offer O
come O
along O
, O
uh O
, O
that O
would O
urge O
Speaker O
Nabih B-PERSON
Berri I-PERSON
to O
, O
uh O
, O
call O
once O
again O
upon O
the O

table O
? O

Uh O
, O
Abir B-PERSON
, O
I O
mean O
, O
the B-ORG
14 I-ORG
February I-ORG
Forces I-ORG
mainly O
tried O
to O
manipulate O
, O
uh O
, O
Shiite B-NORP
bilateralism O
, O
thinking O
there O
could O
be O
certain O
differences O
, O
well O
, O
or O
political O
diversity O
, O
or O
paradoxes O
, O
or O
possibly O
political O
differences O
between O
Speaker O
Berri B-PERSON
on O
the O
one O
hand O
and O
the O
resistance O
and O
Mr. O
Nasrallah B-PERSON
on O
the O
other O
. O

But O
, O
of O
course O
these O
flattering O
and O
laudatory O
attempts O
failed O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Speaker O
Berri B-PERSON
had O
pointed O
out O
at O
the O
dialog O
table O
and O
at O
the O
discussion O
table O
that O
although O
he O
may O
be O
adopting O
an O
initiative O
calling O
for O
unity O
, O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
day O
he O
is O
an O
involved O
party O
and O
will O
remain O
so O
. O

Therefore O
, O
he O
will O
express O
his O
views O
as O
an O
involved O
party O
. O

Speaker O
Berri B-PERSON
, O
today O
, O
and O
until O
the O
last O
moments O
of O
the O
divorce O
kept O
saying O
that O
the O
marriage O
could O
still O
be O
patched O
up O
, O
the O
combination O
of O
national O
accord O
and O
dialog O
were O
still O
possible O
, O
but O
when O
all O
these O
windows O
were O
closed O
, O
the O
final O
cure O
was O
cauterization O
, O
as O
you O
mentioned O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
episode O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
today O
there O
have O
been O
attempts O
to O
revive O
Speaker O
Berri B-PERSON
's O
role O
in O
this O
direction O
, O
but O
let O
's O
admit O
that O
what O
's O
going O
on O
today O
in O
Martyr B-LOC
Square I-LOC
and O
Riyadh B-LOC
Al I-LOC
- I-LOC
Sulh I-LOC

dictates O
a O
new O
national O
political O
game O
to O
Speaker O
Berri B-PERSON
, O
as O
well O
as O
all O
the O
Lebanese B-NORP
parties O
involved O
. O

Today O
there O
can O
be O
no O
return O
to O
any O
discussion O
table O
or O
dialog O
table O
to O
discuss O
matters O
that O
have O
become O
part O
of O
the O
past O
. O

The O
solution O
now O
lies O
in O
devising O
an O
appropriate O
formula O
to O
form O
a O
national O
unity O
government O
and O
calling O
for O
early O
elections O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
form O
Speaker O
Berri B-PERSON
's O
possible O
initiative O
might O
take O
; O
however O
, O
under O
the O
weight O
of O
these O
two O
demands O
, O
it O
is O
impossible O
for O
Speaker O
Berri B-PERSON
to O
make O
any O
new O
moves O
. O

The O

set O
for O
the O

to O
respond O
to O
its O

The O

The O

conducted O
exercises O
with O

ammunition O
and O
marched O
patrols O
through O
the O
capital O
city O
, O
Suva B-GPE
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
fifteen B-QUANTITY
ministers O
from O
the O
sixteen B-QUANTITY
Southern B-ORG
Pacific I-ORG
Association I-ORG
countries O
have O
met O
in O
Sydney B-GPE
in O
Australia B-GPE
to O
discuss O
the O
future O
situations O
and O
come O
up O
with O
a O
solution O
that O
satisfies O
the O
parties O
in O
the O
Fiji B-GPE
crisis O
. O

Joining O
us O
live O
from O
Jeddah B-GPE
is O
Doctor O
Zuhair B-PERSON
Al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Harithy I-PERSON
, O
the O
writer O
and O
researcher O
on O
political O
issues O
. O

Doctor O
Zuhair B-PERSON
, O
do O
you O
expect O
this O
summit O
to O
be O
any O
different O
from O
previous O
summits O
? O

Well O
, O
by O
God O
, O
we O
hope O
so O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
uh O
, O
when O
, O
uh O
, O
we O
feel O
that O
the O
attendance O
of O
all O
the O
leaders O
, O
uh O
, O
reflects O
, O
uh O
, O
the O
importance O
of O
this O
summit O
. O

And O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
also O
relate O
what O
you O
said O
about O
the O
speech O
of O
the O
Custodian O
of O
the B-FAC
Two I-FAC
Holy I-FAC
Shrines I-FAC
today O
, O
which O
was O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
unconventional O
and O
revealed O
that O
there O
is O
actually O
a O
serious O
desire O
to O
come O
out O
with O
complementary O
resolutions O
that O
would O
benefit O
, O
uh O
, O
the O
Council B-ORG
states O
and O
their O
peoples O
. O

Okay O
, O
Doctor O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
uh O
, O
you O
mentioned O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
king O
's O
speech O
. O

There O
's O
no O
doubt O
that O
in O
the O
speech O
, O
he O
pinpointed O
a O
lot O
of O
painful O
areas O
in O
the O
Arab B-NORP
body O
politic O
. O

How O
would O
you O
evaluate O
the O
issues O
to O
be O
addressed O
, O
and O
especially O
those O
related O
to O
the O
Lebanese B-NORP
and O
Iraqi B-NORP
issues O
? O

I O
mean O
, O
I O
think O
that O
the O
Council B-ORG
's O
stance O
on O
these O
two O
issues O
is O
also O
related O
to O
the O
stance O
of O
the B-ORG
Arab I-ORG
League I-ORG
, O
I O
mean O
, O
it O
wo O
n't O
be O
anything O
new O
. O

And O
we O
've O
heard O
resolutions O
and O
political O
stances O
from O
each O
individual O
state O
, O
uh O
, O
which O
uh O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
stress O
the O
unity O
of O
Iraq B-GPE
as O
a O
country O
and O
also O
support O
legitimacy O
in O
Lebanon B-GPE
. O

I O
mean O
, O
these O
are O
the O
two O
main O
issues O
which O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
I O
think O
the O
summit O
will O
focus O
on O
. O

But O
I O
would O
also O
like O
to O
add O
that O
the O
Custodian O
of O
the B-FAC
Two I-FAC
Holy I-FAC
Shrines I-FAC
referred O
today O
to O
an O
important O
point O
when O
he O
indicated O
that O
there O
is O
a O
flaw O
in O
the B-LAW
constitution I-LAW
of I-LAW
the I-LAW
Council I-LAW
. O

He O
pointed O
out O
we O
support O
or O
contribute O
to O
solving O
these O
issues O
outside O
the O
Council B-ORG
states O
or O
those O
related O
to O
the O
region O
and O
we O
can O
not O
solve O
our O
problems O
within O
the O
Council B-ORG
. O

He O
demanded O
that O
when O
there O
is O
a O
unified O
stance O
and O
a O
unified O
word O
, O
it O
can O
contribute O
to O
solving O
the O
pending O
problems O
in O
the O
region O
, O
which O
I O
mean O
, O
have O
reasons O
and O
implications O
that O
affect O
the O
Council B-ORG
states O
. O

Okay O
, O
Doctor O
Zuhair B-PERSON
, O
regarding O
Oman B-GPE
's O
refusal O
to O
join O
the B-ORG
Monetary I-ORG
Union I-ORG
in O
2010 O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
in O
your O
opinion O
, O
how O
much O
impact O
will O
that O
have O
? O

I O
mean O
, O
I O
think O
it O
's O
not O
Oman B-GPE
. O

It O
's O
that O
we O
suffer O
from O
problems O
in O
each O
state O
. O

Each O
country O
has O
temporary O
desires O
and O
interests O
. O

If O
we O
follow O
this O
path O
, O
it O
would O
be O
difficult O
to O
activate O
the O
states O
of O
the B-ORG
Cooperation I-ORG
Council I-ORG
. O

I O
think O
that O
if O
there O
are O
sincere O
intentions O
and O
a O
serious O
desire O
among O
leaders O
for O
the O
good O
of O
the O
people O
, O
not O
only O
with O
regard O
to O
economic O
issues O
or O
even O
the O
military O
issue O
, O
which O
is O
more O
dangerous O
, O
when O
we O
feel O
that O
there O
is O
, O
uh O
, O
uh O
, O
a O
strong O
Iranian B-NORP
presence O
in O
the O
region O
, O
and O
if O
this B-ORG
Cooperation I-ORG
Council I-ORG
does O
not O
transform O
into O
a O
regional O
power O
among O
its O
individuals O
and O
peoples O
in O
order O
to O
realize O
their O
interests O
, O
it O
will O
certainly O
fail O
in O
the O
long O
run O
. O

Um O
. O

Um O
. O

Yes O
. O

Um O
. O

Yes O
. O

Tell O
me O
your O
opinion O
on O
the O
Baker B-ORG
- I-ORG
Hamilton I-ORG
committee I-ORG
recommendations O
? O

First O
of O
all O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
and O
as O
it O
is O
the O
fact O
, O
that O
the O
report O
is O
written O
for O
the O
US B-NORP
administration O
and O
not O
for O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
people O
. O

It O
also O
seems O
, O
as O
far O
as O
I O
know O
, O
that O
it O
represents O
recommendations O
and O
reviews O
rather O
than O
decisions O
. O

The O
decision O
remains O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
US B-NORP
administration O
. O

And O
I O
know O
that O
much O
of O
its O
content O
does O
not O
represent O
the O
will O
and O
direction O
followed O
by O
the O
Administration B-ORG
. O

I O
can O
also O
say O
that O
it O
set O
off O
from O
shaky O
ground O
, O
because O
the O
review O
was O
not O
complete O
in O
covering O
the O
entire O
background O
and O
its O
outcome O
after O
the O
collapse O
of O
the O
regime O
. O

And O
it O
should O
have O
reviewed O
events O
more O
accurately O
, O
and O
made O
them O
into O
a O
fertile O
ground O
for O
a O
solution O
. O

However O
, O
the O
report O
brought O
together O
contradictions O
in O
the O
vision O
and O
recommendations O
. O

The O
vision O
that O
we O
find O
at O
the O
beginning O
may O
differ O
from O
the O
vision O
towards O
the O
end O
and O
the O
initial O
recommendations O
differ O
from O
the O
recommendations O
in O
the O
middle O
, O
perhaps O
due O
to O
it O
being O
written O
by O
multiple O
authors O
or O
for O
having O
a O
muddled O
vision O
. O

But O
they O
expressed O
it O
and O
said O
there O
are O
no O
magic O
solutions O
. O

Perhaps O
the O
reality O
that O
Iraq B-GPE
and O
the O
region O
are O
going O
through O
may O
impose O
itself O
through O
the O
difficulties O
encountered O
by O
those O
who O
think O
they O
are O
providing O
the O
solution O
. O

But O
if O
I O
were O
asked O
to O
briefly O
, O
uh O
, O
evaluate O
the O
report O
, O
I O
would O
say O
that O
it O
is O
not O
lacking O
in O
good O
indications O
related O
to O
the O
political O
course O
and O
the O
unity O
of O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
not O
devoid O
either O
of O
offences O
or O
negative O
trends O
regarding O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
course O
and O
the O
review O
of O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
crisis O
issue O
. O

To O
us O
, O
all O
of O
these O
are O
subject O
to O
revision O
by O
the O
political O
powers O
to O
examine O
the O
positive O
trends O
and O
separate O
them O
from O
the O
negative O
trends O
that O
are O
not O
in O
tune O
with O
the O
prospects O
of O
political O
leaders O
. O

The B-DATE

Ah O
I O
mean O
, O
to O
give O
more O
successful O
opportunities O
to O
the O
conference O
, O
because O
by O
the O
success O
of O
the O
conference O
, O
there O
is O
a O
very O
big O
chance O
for O
Lebanon B-GPE
, O
the O
Lebanese B-NORP
economy O
would O
improve O
, O
the O
living O
conditions O
of O
people O
would O
improve O
, O
and O
Lebanon B-GPE
would O
go O
back O
to O
regain O
its O
position O
and O
regional O
role O
. O

The O
government O

these O
are O
questions O
I O
have O
no O
answer O

but O
the O
answer O
I O
do O
have O
is O
to O
continue O

The O

another O

at O

the O

on O

5,000 B-DATE

Presumed O

With O

evidently O
this O
road O
was O
covered O
and O
people O
built O
over O
it O
, O
and O
uh O
, O
when O
we O
thought O
about O
it O
, O
uh O
, O
really O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
if O
not O
for O
the O
assistance O
of O
Her O
Excellency O
the O
Minister O
Fayza B-PERSON
Aboul I-PERSON
Naga I-PERSON
, O
just O
so O
that O
everyone O
gets O
credit O
in O
Egypt B-GPE
and O
knows O
who O
did O
what O
, O
she O
gave O
us O
this O
financial O
assistance O
of O
240 B-MONEY
million I-MONEY
pounds I-MONEY
. O

Without O
that O
, O
this O
road O
would O
have O
remained O
for O
eternity O
, O
and O
then O
it O
would O
broken O
up O
and O
been O
covered O
. O

So O
she O
gave O
us O
this O
support O
, O
with O
which O
we O
compensated O
the O
residents O
who O
were O
on O
it O
, O
the O
land O
, O
we O
built O
them O
other O
new O
residences O
instead O
. O

So O
now O
we O
have O
seen O
the O
result O
which O
is O
, O
with O
God O
's O
help O
, O
that O
we O
dug O
and O
found O
the O
rams O
intact O
, O

and O
uh O
, O
re-opening O
the B-FAC
Rams I-FAC
Road I-FAC
will O
turn O
Luxor B-GPE
into O
the O
largest O
open O

the O
world O
. O

The O
tourist O
arrives O
in O
the O
temple O
of O
Luxor B-GPE
and O
walks O
on O
the B-FAC
Rams I-FAC
Road I-FAC
until O
Karnak B-GPE

the O

ancient O

The O
