I O
think O

Really O
. O

Right O

Herb O
is O
blowing O
great O
you O
know O

he O
retired O
from O
the O
radio O
finally O

yeah O

I O
knew O
that O

I O
knew O
that O

He O
went O
to O
L B-GPE
A I-GPE

made O
a O
recording O
there O

all O
Al B-PERSON
Cone I-PERSON

He O
's O
actually O
going O

play O
with O
us O
in O
Murenau B-GPE

town O
near O
here O
on O
November B-DATE
thirtieth I-DATE

and O
then O
on O
the B-DATE
following I-DATE
Monday I-DATE
he O
'll O
play O
with O
us O

and O
our O
last O
one O
December B-DATE
%uh I-DATE
eighteenth I-DATE
or O
something O
John B-PERSON
Marshall I-PERSON
is O
coming O
down O
. O

okay O
. O

%huh O
? O

What O
price O
? O

%uh O
, O
free O
Free O
! O
which O
is O
even O
better O
, O
yes O

Wow O
. O

mhm O
. O

But O
what O
about O
you O
? O

%uh O
, O
then O
I O
'll O
work O
on O
me O
. O

%uh O
because O
see O
if O
I O
do O
n't O
get O
back O
%uh O
like O
next B-DATE
week I-DATE
it O
's O
no O
big O
deal O
. O

I O
could O
just O
stay O
here O
. O

So O
it O
's O
not O
important O
for O
me O
. O

Right O
. O

You O
see O
? O

So O
the O
main O
thing O
is O
to O
get O
your O
deal O
. O

So O
you O
might O
not O
come O
back O
here O
? O

Right O
. O

Got O
you O
. O

See O
I O
'm O
only O
be O
there O
for O
like B-DATE
three I-DATE
or I-DATE
four I-DATE
days I-DATE
. O

Right O
. O

So O
I O
mean O
if O
it O
's O
going O
to O
cost O
me O
an O
arm O
and O
a O
leg O
it O
's O
cheaper O
if O
I O
just O
stay O
here O
. O

Right O
. O

So O
you O
do O
n't O
need O

Because O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
do O
anything O
but O
work O
that B-DATE
day I-DATE

so O
. O

Right O
. O

Well O
what O
happens O
to O
your O
work O
then O
? O

Well O
I O
just O
wo O
n't O
do O
it O
. O

But O
I O
mean O
if O
I O
have O
to O
pay O
you O
know O
, O
a B-MONEY
thousand I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
it O
's O
not O
expeditious O
to O
make O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
and O
That O
's O
a O
big O
word O
. O
Those O
crosswords O
are O
making O
you O
use O
big O
words O
. O
pay O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
. O

Is O
that O
what O
it O
is O
? O

Getting O
better O
? O

uh-huh O
. O

mhm O
%hm O

That O
's O
the O
purpose O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

Increase O
your O
word O
power O
. O

mhm O
. O

So O
%um O
Well O
you O
know O
that O
would O
be O
the O
thing O
. O

I O
mean O
there O
's O
no O
way O

I O
'm O
sure O
you O
're O
not O
going O
to O
get O
back O
%uh O
you O
know O
within B-DATE
a I-DATE
day I-DATE
or I-DATE
two I-DATE
of O
the O
time O
. O
You O
know O
because O
there O
're O
eighteen B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
flights O
%uh O
that O
go O
back O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
on O
American B-ORG
. O

On O
American B-ORG
. O

On O
American B-ORG
. O

They O
go O
from O
London B-GPE
. O

oh O
this O
is O
a O
flight O
to O
London B-GPE
? O

Right O
. O

I O
see O
. O

Right O
. O

And O
then O
%uh O
just O
get O
the O
%uh O
connecting O
flight O
. O

Can O
you O
get O
me O
a O
connecting O
flight O
? O

Well O
that O
should O
n't O
be O
a O
problem O
. O

Susan B-PERSON
said O
there O
's O
no O
inter-Europe O
flights O
. O

Right O
. O

Right O
. O

No O
, O

I O
can O
go O
down O
to O
the O
place O
here O
and O

Sure O
. O

Sure O
. O

%uh O
%uh O
nothing O
's O
%uh O
%uh O
possible O
with O
Susan B-PERSON
. O

No O
, O

everybody O
who O
does O
n't O
have O
a O
ticket O
a B-DATE
month I-DATE
ago I-DATE
is O
not O
going O
to O
fly O
for O
the B-DATE
rest I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

So O
you O
do O
n't O
want O
a O
ticket O
to O
Milan B-GPE
, O
for O
nine B-MONEY
hundred I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
? O

Well O
again O
that O
's O
the O
point O
. O

I O
mean O
if O
it O
's O
going O
to O
cost O
that O
%uh O
It O
's O
easier O
for O
me O
just O
to O
get O
yours O
than O
not O
do O
one O
. O

okay O

You O
see O
? O

mhm O
. O

%um O

I O
'm O
eating O
a O
banana O
, O

excuse O
me O
. O

It O
just O

I O
see O
. O

You O
know O
it O
just O
%uh O
depends O
on O
if O
you O
would O
just O
like O
the O
you O
know O
stand O
by O

that O
's O
the O

Well O

You O
know O
to O
have O
a O
sh- O

you O
know O

And O
I O
'd O
have O
to O
stand O
by O
in O
London B-GPE
by O
myself O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

Like O
a O
big O
girl O
, O

yes O
. O

Yes O
. O

Exactly O
. O

but O
exactly O
. O

that O
's O
the O
thing O
. O

You O
know O
we O
Amazing O
. O
just O
pick O
a O
day O
%uh O
you O
know O

like O
probably O
the O
Tuesday B-DATE
like O
the B-DATE
%uh I-DATE
first I-DATE
of I-DATE
August I-DATE
would O
be O
the O
best O
time O
. O

Right O
. O

%um O
Mondays B-DATE
sometimes O
people O
coming O
back O

but O
%uh O
, O
you O
know O
nobody O
leaves O
on O
Tuesdays B-DATE
. O

Well O
do O
you O
think O
it O
would O
be O
better O
to O
come O
like O
on O
that B-DATE
Friday I-DATE
the I-DATE
twenty I-DATE
- I-DATE
first I-DATE

and O
then O
I O
'd O
be O
closer O
to O
the B-DATE
middle I-DATE
of I-DATE
August I-DATE
anyways O
? O

%uh O
, O
well O
I O
mean O
Can O
we O
do O
that O
? O
%mm O
that O
's O
something O
you O
could O
do O
. O

%uh O
, O
you O
know O
the O
other O
thing O
is O

Because O
if O
you O
're O
not O
coming O
anyways O
then O
Right O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
fly O
with O
you O
so O
I O
could O
just O
come O
that B-DATE
Friday I-DATE
. O

Right O
. O

Well O
, O
the O
other O
thing O
is O
that O
you O
could O
just O
stay O
longer O
. O

Right O
. O

Exactly O
. O

Get O
a O
short O
flight O
. O

Just O
stay O
longer O
. O

Well O
, O
yeah O
, O

but O

mhm O
. O

Maybe O
you O
came O
like O
the B-DATE
twenty I-DATE
first I-DATE
%uh O
, O

It O
would O
be O
%uh O
a B-DATE
little I-DATE
over I-DATE
three I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
instead O
of O

Right O
. O

mhm O
. O

I O
think O
I O
should O
go O
back O
to O
work O

but O
I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
better O
if O
I O
came O
on O
the B-DATE
twenty I-DATE
first I-DATE

that O
way O
then O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

If O
you O
can O
change O
it O
. O

Well O
I O
can O
probably O
change O
it O
. O

Because O
that O
way O
oh O
. O
I O
'll O
be O
closer O
to O
the B-DATE
middle I-DATE
of I-DATE
August I-DATE

and O
hopefully O
when O
the O
problems O
arise O

good O
restaurant O
. O

They O
were O
people O
who O
went O
to O
the O
jazz O
festival O
with O
me O
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

They O
own O
the O
restaurant O
. O

oh O
sure O
. O

So O
they O
'll O
probably O
want O
to O
go O
with O
us O
this B-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

That O
's O
fine O
. O

Nice O
people O
. O

Cool O

Cool O
. O

Cool O
. O

Cool O

yes O
yes O
. O

So O
have O
any O
of O
your O
things O
closed O
? O

No O
. O

Nothing O

Nothing O
. O

I O
just O
had O
a O
nice O
dream O
though O
that O
David B-PERSON
was O
just O
fine O
. O
uh-huh O
. O
That O
he O
got O
his O
money O
in O
today B-DATE
like O
he O
's O
supposed O
to O
. O

Right O
. O

That O
was O
a O
dream O
. O

So O
he O
still O
has O
n't O
made O
any O
inroads O
? O

%uh O
%uh O
. O

Nothing O
%huh O
? O

He O
's O
having O
trouble O
closing O
his O
station O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

It O
may O
not O
happen O
. O

oh O
god O
. O

If O
that O
does O
n't O
happen O
he O
'll O
commit O
suicide O
. O

The O
station O
? O

Right O
. O

If O
he O
does O
n't O
get O
the O
station O
. O
Probably O
. O
He O
'll O
commit O
suicide O
. O

He O
'll O
be O
in O
bad O
shape O
. O

mhm O

and O
then O
that O
's O
because O
everybody O
involved O
will O
get O
sued O
. O

What O
do O
you O
mean O
? O

Everybody O
involved O
? O

Does O
that O
mean O
Shirl B-PERSON
Clay I-PERSON
? O

Probably O
. O

Why O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
they O
can O

but O
I O
think O
they O
'll O
try O
. O

You O
know O
how O
people O
are O
. O

could O
you O
enroll O
in O
two B-CARDINAL
other O
courses O
if O
you O
wanted O
to O
? O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
one B-CARDINAL
you O
're O
already O
in O
, O
are O
there O
two B-CARDINAL
other O
things O
that O
you O
'd O
also O
like O
to O
take O
? O

For O
example O
. O

I O
know O
there O
's O
a O
limit O
for O
students O
who O
e- O

%uh O
a O
limit O
for O
what O
? O

You O
know O
I O
'm O
thinking O
a O
lot O
about O
this O
job O
that O
I O
just O
took O
that O
you O
know O
you O
seem O
to O
think O
is O
a O
dead O
end O
and O
obviously O
does O
n't O
make O
enough O
money O

and O
you O
know O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
like O
it O
. O

You O
do O
n't O
know O
that O
going O
into O
a O
job O
. O

There O
's O

I O
understand O
that O
. O

Well O
tha- O

I O
understand O
that O
. O

You O
've O
taken O
it O

and O
that O
's O
a O

I O
feel O
like O
I O
just O
made O
a O
big O
mistake O
. O

Liz B-PERSON
I O
ca O
n't O
tell O
you O
whether O
you O
did O
or O
not O
. O

It O
just O
feels O
lousy O
. O

And O
I O
just O
tried O
for O
the O
longest O
time O
to O
figure O
out O
what O
to O
do O
. O

Liz B-PERSON
, O
Liz B-PERSON
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
whether O
you O
made O
a O
mistake O
or O
not O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
possibly O
tell O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
even O
have O
enough O
information O
to O
say O
whether O
you O
did O
or O
not O
. O

And O
you O
will O
find O
out O
. O

And O
if O
it O
's O
a O
huge O
mistake O
you O
'll O
just O
quit O
, O

that O
's O
all O
. O

You O
have O
no O
way O
of O
knowing O
. O

Did O
you O
tell O
the O
public O
health O
people O
that O
you O
definitely O
do O
n't O
want O
that O
job O
? O

No O

I O
did O
n't O
tell O
them O
anything O
. O

oh O
okay O
. O

is O
that O
really O
such O
an O
awful O
job O
? O

Sounded O
to O
me O
like O
a O
lot O
of O
interesting O
things O
. O

Sounded O
to O
me O
like O
too O
much O

but O
it O
sounded O
like O
a O
very O
interesting O
set O
of O
things O
. O

Is O
that O
something O
you O
definitely O
would O
not O
want O
to O
do O
? O

I O
you O
had O
said O
that O
was O
an O
easier O
job O
in O
some O
ways O
. O

What O
? O

Actually O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
so O
anymore O
because O
I O
think O
that O
it O
's O
too O
many O
things O
. O

for O
either O
one O
of O
them O
are O
you O
going O
to O
have O
to O
spend O
hours O
preparing O
outside O
of O
the O
hours O
that O
you O
actually O
get O
paid O
for O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
yet O
. O

Because O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
that O
would O
be O
warranted O
-- O
-- O
at O
the O
salary O
that O
they O
're O
giving O
you O
. O

I O
think O
that O
you O
ought O
to O
be O
able O
to O
circumscribe O
your O
hours O
very O
carefully O
. O

I O
just O
got O
this O
call O
yesterday O
from O
this O

I O
mean O
I O
j- O

Liz B-PERSON

it O
was O
on O
a O
message O
on O
my O
machine O
when O
I O
came O
home O
from O
this O
nurse O
at O
a O
high O
school O
nearby O
saying O
I O
should O
call O
her O
about O
openings O
in O
the O
district O
that O
she O
called O
me O
because O
of O
one O
of O
the O
letters O
I O
wrote O
to O
one O
of O
the O
principals O
oh O
yeah O
? O
who O
knows O
what O
kinds O
of O
openings O
there O
are O
. O

mhm O
. O

mhm O
. O

So O
may- O

Lizzy B-PERSON
I O
know O
how O
up O
in O
the O
a- O

you O
know O
when O
I O
was O
in O
graduate O
school O
I O
spent O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
in O
my O
last O
year O
of O
college O
thinking O
about O
whether O
wanted O
to O
go O
into O
biophysics O
or O
wanted O
to O
teach O
little O
kids O
. O

And O
I O
knew O
it O
was O
obviously O
because O
what O
I O
really O
wanted O
to O
do O
was O
go O
into O
biophysics O
but O
also O
have O
my O
own O
little O
kids O
. O

But O
I O
went O
into O
biophysics O
. O

By O
the B-DATE
end I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
year I-DATE
I O
'd O
met O
Daddy O

and O
I O
decided O
that O
was O
going O
to O
be O
it O
. O

I O
really O

Daddy O
was O
really O
going O
to O
be O
the O
one O
. O

I O
got O
very O
unhappy O
with O
the O
science O
. O

and O
I O
just O
walked O
out O
of O
one O
lab O

and O
I O
said O
no O
this O
is O
it O
. O

I O
just O
do O
n't O
want O
it O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
be O
teaching O
little O
kids O
. O

Because O
Daddy O
was O
at O
that O
point O
noncommittal O
to O
say O
the O
least O
. O

%um O
and O
he O
was O
also O
leaving O
for O
Syracuse B-GPE
. O

And O
so O
a O
friend O
of O
mine O
sat O
down O
with O
me O
, O
Wayne B-PERSON
Meyers I-PERSON

and O
he O
said O
he O
was O
a O
very O
bright O
guy O
. O

He O
was O
the O
one O
whose O
shoulder O
I O
cried O
on O
when O
I O
took O
Dexadrin B-PRODUCT
that O
time O
too O
for O

the O
doctor O
had O
given O
it O
to O
me O
for O
cramps O

and O
I O
ended O
up O
getting O
%um O
depressed O
for O
twenty B-TIME
- I-TIME
four I-TIME
hours I-TIME
. O

%um O
and O
he O
said O
to O
me O
you O
really O
want O
to O
change O
. O

I O
said O
yeah O
I O
really O
want O
to O
go O
. O

He O
says O
well O
take O
the O
bus O
across O
the O
river O
this O
afternoon O
because O
I O
had O
already O
applied O
and O
been O
accepted O
to O
the O

I O
mean O
it O
went O
so O
far O
that O
I O
applied O
both O
to O
biophysics O
and O
to O
%um O
Harvard B-ORG
School I-ORG
of I-ORG
Ed I-ORG
. O

And O
I O
did O
n't O
apply O
to O
any O
other O
ed O
schools O
because O
I O
figured O
I O
could O
get O
in O
there O
which O
I O
had O
. O

And O
I O
went O
across O
the O
river O
that O
day O

and O
I O
said O
can O
I O
get O
into O
your O
next B-DATE
year I-DATE
's O
class O
. O

And O
they O
said O
absolutely O
. O

And O
I O
mean O
by O
then O
it O
was O
like O
May B-DATE
. O

Certainly O
April B-DATE
. O

Certainly O
April B-DATE
not O
earlier O
. O

And O
I O
remember O
Mama O
Sadie B-PERSON
was O
upset O
about O
it O
. O

But O
everybody O
knew O
why O
I O
was O
doing O
it O

and O
everybody O
kn- O

it O
was O
obvious O
even O
to O
Daddy O
why O
I O
had O
to O
do O
that O
for O
a O
while O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
just O
study O
science O
for O
a O
while O
. O

And O
I O
was O
twenty B-DATE
- I-DATE
two I-DATE
. O
Twenty B-DATE
- I-DATE
one I-DATE
. O

and O
%um O
yeah O
I O
guess O
I O
was O
twenty B-DATE
- I-DATE
two I-DATE
already O
. O

%um O
and O
it O
's O
not O
any O
rational O
kind O
of O
thing O
Liz B-PERSON
. O

It O
's O
hormonal O
. O

It O
's O
absolutely O
hormonal O
. O

I O
mean O
here O
you O
are O
, O

you O
are O
thirty O
. O

And O
it O
's O
no O
wonder O
that O
you O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
you O
want O
to O
do O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
know O
what O
I O
wanted O
to O
do O
at O
that O
stage O
. O

Well O
I O
did O

but O
it O
was O
out O
of O
reach O
. O

And O
for O
you O
it O
's O
obviously O
out O
of O
reach O
too O
. O

Unless O
it O
works O
out O
with O
Matt B-PERSON
you O
have O
n't O
met O
him O
. O

And O
therefore O
I O
'm O
disappointed O
in O
how O
you O
're O
going O
about O
it O
because O
I O
've O
known O
so O
many O
people O
who O
did O
n't O
get O
married O
and O
so O
many O
people O
who O
got O
married O
too O
late O
to O
have O
children O
. O

It O
's O
very O
sad O
. O

I O
find O
it O
very O
sad O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
expect O
that O
I O
would O
be O
in O
this O
position O
with O
my O
children O
. O

Well O
actually O
I O
expected O
it O
with O
Jonathan B-PERSON
. O

I O
expected O
to O
worry O
about O
him O
not O
you O
because O
he O
was O
very O
slow O
socially O
. O

and O
you O
know O
you O
never O
can O
tell O
with O
life O
. O

There O
are O
n't O
any O
rules O
about O
it O

and O
%uh O
nobody O
has O
written O
the O
future O
. O

And O
it O
's O
%uh O
%eh O
prayer O

and O
%uh O
%eh O
penitence O
does O
n't O
really O
help O
. O

It O
's O
going O
to O
happen O
, O

things O
are O
going O
to O
happen O
when O
they O
happen O
. O

But O
there O
are O
ways O
to O
help O
them O
along O
. O

There O
are O
ways O
to O
help O
them O
along O
. O

And O
maybe O
you O
're O
doing O
them O

but O
I O
do O
n't O
see O
it O
. O

I O
know O
you O
went O
out O
with O
some O
guy O
the O
other O
night O
. O

maybe O
you O
are O
looking O
actively O

but O
I O
do O
n't O
see O
it O
. O

So O
all O
I O
can O
do O
is O
sit O
and O
worry O
and O
be O
concerned O

and O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
Can O
we O
talk O
about O
the O
job O
things O
now O
? O
that O

Well O
what O
about O
the O
job O
things O
? O

I O
ca O
n't O
talk O
about O
them O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
anything O
about O
them O
. O

You O
want O
to O
tell O
me O
about O
them O
? O

Well O
you O
do O
n't O
like O
the O
job O
I O
just O
took O
. O

Now O
wait O
a O
moment O
. O

Do O
n't O

Well O
Daddy O
says O
they O
're O
less O
important O
than O
the O
other O
stuff O

and O
I O
agree O
. O

But O
do O
n't O
tell O
me O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
the O
job O
you O
just O
took O
Lizzy B-PERSON
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
enough O
about O
it O
. O

You O
know O
I O
raised O
you O

and O
I O
thought O
I O
was O

So O
maybe O
I O
can O
sign O
ten O
hours O
in O
the O
school O
district O
doing O
something O
else O
. O

Maybe O
you O
can O
. O

%eh O
that O
would O
be O
interesting O
if O
you O
know O
you O
have O
hours O
during O
the O
week O
that O
are O
available O
. O

do O
n't O
block O
them O
out O
until O
you O
find O
out O
whether O
or O
not O
you O
can O
take O
an O
art O
course O
during O
the O
week O
. O
so O
that O
you O
can O
have O
your O

I O
mean O
you O
know O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
see O
you O
flying O
down O
to O
%um O
where O
was O
it O
that O
they O
had O
that O
hiking O
group O
San B-GPE
Francisco I-GPE
for O
the O
weekends O
. O

mhm O

I O
want O
to O
fly O
out O
to O
Michigan B-GPE
and O
visit O
Matt B-PERSON
. O

That O
's O
where O
I O
want O
to O
fly O
. O

%uh O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
see O
you O
do O
that O
too O
. O

All O
I O
want O
is O
your O
happiness O
Liz B-PERSON
. O

And O
I O
think O
I O
know O
what O
will O
make O
you O
happy O
. O

Well O
I O
just O
want O
to O
figure O
out O
what O
I O
want O
to O
do O
with O
my O
life O
. O

You O
know O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
'm O
never O
going O
to O
figure O
it O
out O
. O

Lizzy B-PERSON
, O
you O
might O
not O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
figured O
out O
mine O
yet O
. O

You O
're O
a O
scientist O
. O

I O
'm O
a O
scientist O
. O

Liz B-PERSON
, O
that O
's O
a O
pretty O
poor O
showing O
for O
a O
scientist O
. O

Ma O
, O
are O
you O
kidding O
? O

Look O
how O
many O
days O
you O
go O
into O
the O
lab O
. O

I O
know O
. O

Look O
what O
I O
've O
published O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
paper O
. O

So O
who O
cares O
about O
publishing O
. O

Well O
that O
's O
what O

otherwise O
, O
I O
'm O
cooking O

and O
nobody O
's O
eating O
it O
. O

it O
's O
recycling O

it O
's O
it O
's O
working O
that O
nobody O
ever O
knows O
about O
. O

That O
's O
not O
what O
defines O
me O
as O
a O
person O
. O

What O
defines O
me O
as O
a O
person O
is O
my O
family O
. O

And O
your O
failure O
daughter O
. O

That O
's O
what O
I O
'm O
feeling O
sad O
about O
at O
the O
moment O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
going O
to O
be O
able O
to O
figure O
out O
what O
I O
want O
to O
do O
. O

I O
just O
did O
n't O
know O
. O

I O
thought O
this O
might O
be O
interesting O
okay O
. O

and O
maybe O

That O
's O
fine O
. O

I O
do O
n't O

that O
's O
not O
my O
big O
worry O

And O
now O
%um O
Mindy B-PERSON
is O
coming O
with O
her O

Monday B-DATE

so O
we O
decided O
we O
'd O
take O
about O
five B-DATE
days I-DATE
off O
. O

They O
'll O
be O
here O
for O
two B-DATE
weeks I-DATE

so O
we O
'll O
be O
here O
for O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
week O
with O
them O
. O

And O
that O
will O
be O
good O
. O

%uh O

yeah O
. O

Anyhow O
, O
she O
's O
so O
busy O

did O
you O
get O
her O
invitation O
for O
the O

I O
did O

and O
I O
sent O
back O
%uh O
my O
oh O
good O
. O
R O
S O
V O
P O
just O
for O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
us O
though O
because O
yeah O
. O
that O
's O
the O
same O
day O
that O
%um O

you O
know O
the O
thing O
that O
%uh O
we O
usually O
go O
to O
in O
Boca B-GPE
Raton I-GPE
? O

yeah O

down O
in O
Florida B-GPE

yeah O

yeah O
, O

well O
this O
year O
they O
switched O
it O
from O
Where O

it O
? O
November B-DATE
October B-DATE
or O
from O
December B-DATE
whenever O
it O
was O
yeah O
right O
to O
that O

it O
starts O
that O
day O
. O

oh O
phoo O
. O

So O
, O

Now O
where O
is O
it O
taking O
place O
now O
? O

In O
Boca B-GPE
Raton I-GPE
again O
. O

oh O
again O
. O
%ah O

So O
I O
think O
what O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
do O
is O
%um O
, O

well O
we O
'll O
both O
probably O

the O
way O
it O
works O
I O
'll O
just O
leave O
the O
same O
time O
except O
I O
will O
head O
for O
yeah O
yeah O
oh O
great O
. O
there O
and O
he O
'll O
head O
for O
Florida B-GPE

great O
. O

oh O
great O
. O

Well O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
take O
%uh O
a O
room O
in O
the O
hotel O
too O
over O
the O
weekend O

I O
think O
I O
'll O
probably O
go O
in O
earlier O
in O
the O
week O

And O
%uh O

but O
I O
thought O
I O
'd O
also O
stay O
at O
the O
hotel O
because O
there O
will O
be O
so O
many O
people O
there O
that O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
see O
. O

%ah O

So O
I O

if O
you O
%uh O
saw O
that O
response O
card O
it O
said O
something O
about O
calling O
the O
Hilton B-ORG

and O
Mindy B-PERSON
had O
a O
rate O
yeah O
. O
for O
the O
family O
which O
was O
seventy B-MONEY
- I-MONEY
nine I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY

so O
if O
it O
's O
anything O
other O
than O
that O
insist O
that O
you O
're O
with O
the O
Landau B-PERSON
party O
. O

oh O
. O
okay O
. O

Because O
Huck B-PERSON
's O
sister O
had O
called O
and O
they O
had O
told O
her O
ninety B-MONEY
- I-MONEY
nine I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY

and O
when O
I O
spoke O
to O
Mindy B-PERSON
she O
said O
she O
had O
just O
rechecked O
with O
them O
this B-DATE
week I-DATE

so O
there O
was O
some O
misunderstanding O
there O

%huh O
! O

but O
nevertheless O
. O
We O
're O
looking O
forward O
to O
it O
. O

It O
's O
the O
first O
family O
get O
- O
together O

've O
had O
in O

that O
's O
why O
I O
yeah O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
miss O
it O
. O

I O

yeah O

and O
so O
it O
should O
be O
fun O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
%uh O
. O

hey O
you O
know O
I O
wrote O
my O
dad O
and O
asked O
him O
if O
he O
was O
going O
or O

oh O
I O
should O
hope O
so O
. O

Gosh O
. O

I O
hope O

too O
. O

is O
n't O

far O
for O
them O

's O

No O

oh O
yeah O
. O
%um O

anyway O
yeah O
yeah O
. O
%um O
Bob B-PERSON

Pearl B-PERSON

another O
setback O
about B-DATE
two I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
ago I-DATE

she O
had O
a O
small O
stroke O

oh O
my O
God O

but O
she O
was O
in O
the O
hospital O
with O
that O
for O
a O
week B-DATE

but O
I O
just O
talked O
to O
her O

her O
left O
arm O
and O
she O
happens O
to O
be O
lefthanded O
%uh O
was O
hit O

and O
%um O
she O
said O
she O
's O
getting O
it O
back O
. O

She O
's O
almost O
able O
to O
write O
again O
. O

In O
fact O
she O
's O
been O
trying O
to O
. O

%uh O

But O
yesterday B-DATE
was O
really O
her O
first B-ORDINAL
day O
that O
she O
was O
out O

and O
%ah O
she O
's O
so O
fantastic O
. O

Every O
time O
I O
call O
her O
she O
just O
you O
know O
always O
sounds O
so O
up O
. O

Of O

I O
talked O
to O
Jackie B-PERSON
too O

and O
Jackie B-PERSON
always O
sounds O
so O
down O

yeah O
, O

I O
think O
j- O

she O
's O
so O

oh O
it O
's O
really O
hitting O
Jackie B-PERSON
so O
hard O
. O

She O
's O
just O
very O
upset O
about O
it O
. O

But O
oh O
I O
just O
hope O
to O
God O
she O
gets O
over O
the O
cancer O
part O
. O

That O
's O
the O
worst O
part O

and O
I O
have O

I O
think O
that O
the O
other O
lung O
is O
affected O
too O

but O
sh- O

yeah O
. O

oh O
God O

not O
going O
to O
do O
chemotherapy O
again O
. O

She O
just O
does O
n't O
want O
to O

%uh O

I O
had O
been O
down O
to O
Atlantic B-GPE
City I-GPE

oh O
I O
think O
it O
was O
my O
fiftieth B-ORDINAL
high O
school O
reunion O
early B-DATE
June I-DATE

and O
I O
stayed O
with O
them O
that O
weekend O

and O
we O
had O
such O
a O
good O
time O
. O

She O
was O
great O

and O
that O
Sunday B-DATE
night O
while O
we O
were O
there O
she O
had O
that O
small O
heart O
attack O
. O

Did O
you O
know O
about O
that O
? O

No O
. O

yeah O
, O

%eh O
she O
had O
a O
heart O
attack O
that O
night O

%uh O

She O
was O
having O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
pressure O
and O
pain O

and O
you O
know O
we O
thought O
maybe O
it O
's O
indigestion O
or O
this O
or O
that O

and O
she O
oh O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
go O
to O
the O
hospital O
there O

so O
they O
went O
straight O
on O
home O

and O
it O
was O
hard O
for O
them O

she O
was O
in O
a O
lot O
of O
pain O

but O
she O
did O
have O
a O
heart O
attack O

oh O
well O
that O
's O
of O
course O
related O
to O
the O
stroke O
that O
she O
just O
had O
. O

oh O

%uh O

yeah O

I O
tell O
you O

it O
's O
just O
been O
one O
thing O
after O
another O

and O
as O
soon O
she O
has O
gotten O
over O
one O
she O
's O
just O
hit O
with O
something O
else O

but O
when O
you O
talk O
to O
her O
she O
's O
just O
wonderful O
you O
know O

she O
just O
really O
tries O
to O
keep O
her O
spirits O
up O
and O
tries O
to O
help O
everybody O
else O
. O

her O
kids O
have O
been O
great O

and O
Jackie O
has O
been O
great O

poor O

Jackie B-PERSON
did O
get O
to O
Atlantic B-GPE
City I-GPE
for O
a O
month B-DATE
. O

She O
had O
rented O
a O
place O
there O
. O

oh O

yeah O

so O
she O
had O
a O
good O
month O

that O
's O
good O

It O
was O
n't O
until O
the O
end O
that O
%uh O
Pearl B-PERSON
was O
n't O
feeling O
so O
well O
again O
. O

oh O

But O
it O
's O
stinky O
! O

It O
is O
. O

It O
is O
just O

I O
know O
. O

We O
've O
had O
a O
very O
stinky O
%um O

We O
're O
fine O

yeah O

but O
we O
've O
had O
so O
many O
friends O
actually O

I O
think O
that O
's O
part O
of O
what O
has O
occupied O
me O
since O
really O
really O
April O
I O
think O
whatever O
the O
day O
of O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
Real- O
Seder O

yeah O

You O
probably O
even O
remember O
him O
. O

Remember O
our O
friend O
Dick B-PERSON
Bryner I-PERSON
. O

He O
's O
a O
judge O

he O
has O
white O
hair O

he O
's O
just O
absolutely O
charming O
guy O

mhm O
mhm O

I O
'm O
not O
sure O
that O
I O
do O
remember O

oh O

and O
%uh O
he O
was O
part O
of O
the O
biking O
group O

uh-huh O

and O
I O
think O
he O
had O
a O
bad O
bike O
accident O
%um O

really O

but O
they O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
it O
was O
a O
bad O
bike O
accident O
or O
a O
major O
stroke O
that O
uh-huh O
created O
a O
bi- O

but O
he O
nearly O
died O

we O
spent O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
there O

he O
was O

oh O

you O
know O
if O

right O
after O
the O
accident O
? O

yeah O

then O
I O
mean O
the O
accident O
nearly O
killed O
him O

oh O
God O

and O
he O
's O
still O
in O
a O
rehabilitation O
oh O
really O
hospital O
did O
n't O
die O

but O
he O
's O
paralysed O
on O
one O
side O

and O
he O
's O
oh O
God O
half O
blind O

and O
he O

oh O
what O
a O
shame O

is O
he O
about O
Bob B-PERSON
's O
age O
? O

and O
so O
that O

yeah O

and O
it O

I O
mean O

really O
a O
very O
good O
friend O

and O
it O
's O
been O
horrible O

yeah O

really O

oh O

and O
his O
mind O
seems O
I O
mean O
to O
be O
back O
almost O
which O
is O
oh O
yeah O
yeah O
wonderful O

but O
that O
was O
awful O

and O
then O
I O
have O
%uh O
%huh O
another O
friend O
%uh O
who O
was O
also O
at O
the O
party O
%mm O
who O
just O
%um O
got O
%uh O

soon O
except O
maybe O
this O
is O
just O
%um O

but O
I O
was O
thinking O
about O
it O
because O
I O
even O
thought O
I O
wanted O

about O
it O
because O
I O
thought O
there O
's O
no O
word O
for O

yeah O

oh O

you O
know O
when O
people O
say O
how O
are O

I O
've O
been O
so O
depre- O

you O
just O

count O
your O
blessings O

Deloitte B-ORG
Touche I-ORG
Wow O
developed O
these O
separate O
wings O
of O
management O
consultants O
to O
go O
out O
and O

%uh O
this O
is O
a O
retooling O
kind O
of O
of O
uh-huh O
Blue B-ORG
Shield I-ORG
of O
California B-GPE
that O

really O
good O
time O

oh O

now O
and O
then O
. O

yeah O
, O

is O
he O
enjoying O
the O
work O
that O
he O
's O
doing O
? O

yeah O
, O

at O
first O
it O
completely O
intimidated O
him O
because O
oh O
. O
they O
really O
are O
asking O
him O
to O
research O
a O
rather O
major O
part O
of O
it O

and O
he O
thought O
oh O
my O
g- O

he O
said O
it O
felt O
like O
oh O
. O
being O
suddenly O
told O
you O
're O
in O
the O
Olympics B-EVENT
and O
here O
's O
the O
torch O
and O
get O
it O

oh O

but O
after O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
he O
said O
he O
thought O
he O
understood O
what O
he O
was O
doing O
. O

That O
's O
good O
. O

and O
he O
's O
done O
wonderfully O
in O
school O
. O

not O
really O
very O
far O

and O
you O
know O
it O
's O
a O
question B-PERSON
of O
having B-GPE
a O
few O
solid O
days O
to O
work O
on O
it O
you O
know O
which O
I O
just O
have O
n't O
had O

I O
mean O

Well O
I O
mean O
is O
it O
too O
much O
to O
ask O
you O
to O
just O
come O
up O
to O
Windsor B-DATE
and O
finish O
it O
after O
you O
get O
back O
. O

Well O
we O
've O
got O
to O
move O

and O
I O
've O
got O
to O
do O
my O
classes O

you O
know O
but O
you O
know O
I O
'm O
only O
teaching O
I O
think O
one O
class O

so O
I O
'll O
have O

I O
just O
would O
feel O
better O
if O
you O
had O
it O
done O
before O
you O
turned O
up O
at O
the O
department O
. O

I O
mean O
you O
're O
coming O
back O
the O
thirty O
- O
first O

you O
do O
n't O
start O
teaching O
until O
when O
? O

Like O
the O
fifth O
or O
sixth O

I O
mean O

%ach O
. O

yeah O
. O

Lord O
. O

yeah O

no O

it O
's O
n- O

yeah O

you O
know O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
a O
big O
deal O

%uh O
I O
really O
kind O
of O
doubt O
that O
Michelle B-PERSON
-- O
-- O
will O
be O
ready O
to O
go O

%um O
you O
know O
she O
was O
already O
talking O
about O
sort O
of O
middle O
of O
September O
%um O
in O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
spring O
. O

oh O
god O
. O

yeah O

but O
she O
's O
got O
more O
leeway O
than O
you O
I O
think O
. O

yeah O

but O
I O
've O
got O
so O
much O
more O
going O
for O
me O
than O
she B-DATE
does I-DATE
. O
I O
know O
. O
You O
know O
in O
the O
larger O
scheme O
. O

If O
they O
do O
n't O
tenure O
you O
we O
'll O
sue O
them B-DATE
. O

We O
wo O
n't O
sue O
them O

but O
no O

anyway O
so O
It O
'll O
work O
out O

so O
I O
'm O

I O
mean O
I O
caught O
myself O
today O
just O
getting O
a O
little O
sort O
of O

Edgy O
. O

yeah O
. O

Well O
look O
%um O

but O

If O
you O
change O
your O
mind O
and O
you O
want O
to O
just O
come O
right O
up O
to O
Windsor O
and O
%um O
finesse O
the O
move O
we O
can O
do O
that O
. O

No O
. O

No O

I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
do O
that O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
do O
that O
. O
because O
it O
'll O
be O
better O
to O
do O
the O
move O
right O
away O
anyway O
because O
you O
know O
I O
ca O
n't O
come O
home O
and O
go O
right O
to O
work O

I O
just O
ca O
n't O
do O
that O
. O

You O
'll O
be O
exhausted O

yeah O
. O

yeah O

and O
I O
wo O
n't O
want O
to O
do O
it O
. O

I O
wo O
n't O
be O
able O
to O
concentrate O
. O

Right O

whereas O
we O
can O
do O
things B-PERSON

Whereas O
spending O
time O
together O
and O
moving O
and O
settling O
in O
while O
moving O
is O
fine O

yeah O
. O

yeah O
. O

All O
right O

well O
%um O
I O
guess O
we O
'll O
have O
to O
figure O
out O
our O
respective O
movements O
when B-TIME
it O
gets O
closer O

but O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
%um O
Ashfield O
with O
Greg O
uh-huh O
. O
tomorrow O

uh-huh O
. O

And O
%um O

Stay O
up O
there O
? O

Well O
Greg O
and O
%uh O
Jimco O
and B-PERSON
the I-PERSON
kids I-PERSON
are O
leaving O
for O
Japan O
tomorrow B-DATE

uh-huh O
. O

and O
%um O
%uh O
Greg O
's O
going O
to O
go O
up O
on O
a O
hiking O
trip O
with O
a O
friend O

uh-huh O

but O
he O
's O
going O
to O
%um O
stop O
by O
Ashfield O
to O
drop O
off O
the O
dogs O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

So O
he O
can O
take B-PERSON
me O
and O
the O
baby O
up O

uh-huh O
. O

and O
then O
I O
'll O
maybe O
come O
back O
down O
with O
him O

he O
's O
coming O
back O
down O
I O
guess O
ten O
days O
later O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

I O
mean O
he O
's O
not O
staying O
the O
whole O
time O

but O
he O
'll O
come O
back O
the O
last O
weekend O
of O
the O
month O
I O
think O
they O
said O
uh-huh O
. O
and O
then O
go O
back O
down O
to O
New O
York O

and O
he O
can O
probably O
take O
us O
then O
because O
it O
's O
gotten O
to O
be O
just O
moving O
on O
my O
own O
is O
just O
very O
very O
difficult O
. O

No O

stay O
up O
there O
. O

%um O
well O
and B-PERSON
I O
'm O
going O
to O
try O
and O
get O
back O
to O
work O
on O
my O
paper O
which O
is O
just O
ridiculous O

but O
yeah B-DATE
. O
uh-huh O
. O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
make O
an B-PERSON
effort O
. O

Well O
we O
can B-PERSON
both O
make O
an O
effort O
you O
know O

I O
'll O
finish O
my O
book O

you O
finish O
your O
paper B-PERSON
you O
know O
. O
yeah O
. O
if O
you O
have O
n't B-PERSON
already O

Although O
you O
know O
CUNY O
classes B-PERSON
start O
really O
early O
. O

uh-huh O

yeah O

but O
then O
do O
n't O
you O
have O
all O
those O
holidays O
right O
at O
the O
beginning O
? O

That O
's O
true B-PERSON
. O

That O
's O
a O
good O
point O
. O

I O
should O
really O
use O
those O
should O
n't O
I O
? O

yeah O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
lined O
up O
any O
childcare O
yet O

I O
'm O
being O
really O
flaky O
about O
it O

and O
I O
know O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
hate O
myself O
later O
. O

You O
know O
I O
really O
ought O
to O
take O
the O
semester O
off O

but O
did O
I O
tell O
you O
this O
is B-PERSON
the O
last O
year O
of O
the O

is O
that O
for O
sure O
? O

It O
's O
not O
for B-PERSON
sure O
yet O

uh-huh O
. O
%um O
but O
they O
've O
sent O
CUNY O
a O
letter O
uh-huh O
. O
saying O
that O
the O
President O
did O
not O
ask O
for O
funding O
for O
it O
in O
his O
budget O
uh-huh O
. O
and O
it O
looks O
quite O
doubtful O
that O
the O
Senate O
is O
going O
to O
want O
to O
put O
it O
back O
in O
. O
uh-huh O
%um O
so O
that O
CUNY O
thinks O
that O
this O
is O
the O
last O
year O
of O
it O

so O
I O
'm O
reluctant O
to O
take O
a O
semester O
off O
uh-huh O
. O
considering O
that O
I O
would O
only O
then O
have O
one O
semester O
left O
. O

Well O
anyway B-DATE
I O
mean O
apart O
from O
the O
tenure O
and O
the O
book O
you O
know O
this O
is O
not O
going O
to O
be O
a O
killing O
term O
for O
me O
. O

I O
'm O
only O
teaching O
one O
class O

and O
I O
've O
taught O
it O
before O

uh-huh O
. O

so O
you O
know O

and O
I O

Well O
once O
your O
tenure O
file O
goes O
in O
I O
'll O
be O
ready O
to O
believe O
that O

but O
until O
you O
get O
it O
in O
I O
think O
you O
know O
you O
should O
not O
be O
cutting O
corners O
on O
putting O
that O
file O
together O
. O

Obvious O
. O

That O
's O
like O
critical O
for O
us O
. O

yeah O

yeah O
. O

So O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
you O
to O
take O
on O
a O
lot O
of O
extra O
stuff O
at O
the O
beginning O
because O
well O
I O
it O
does O
n't O
make O
sense O
. O

yeah O
. O

believe O
me O
dear O

once O
you O
have O
tenure O
I O
will O
have O
no O
mercy O
. O

Good O
good O
. O

Especially O
because O
you O
're O
going O
to O
be O
away O
every O
summer O
yeah O
. O
you O
're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
take O
a O
lot O
of O
responsibility O
during O
the O
year O
to O
make O
me O
feel O
like O
things O
are O
at B-DATE
all I-DATE
equal O
. O

Right O
. O

But O
not O
immediately O
this O
semester O
just O
because O
okay O
. O
you O
know O
you O
've O
got O
a O
child O
now O
. O

That O
's O
right O
. O

You O
've O
got O
to B-CARDINAL
get O
tenure O
. O

That O
's O
right O
. O

So O
what O
was O
the O
time O
in O
New O
Mexico O
like O
? O

So O

oh O
god B-CARDINAL
it O
was O
horrible O
. O

Really O
? O

It O
was O
horrible O
. O

Why O
? O

I O
was O
so O
tense O

and O
the O
baby O
was O
so O
unhappy O

because O
you O
were O
tense O

and O
I O
think O
that O
's O
what O
it O
is O
yeah B-DATE
sure O
. O
because O
the O
minute O
I O
got O
here O
I O
relaxed B-DATE
completely O

and O
she O
's O
been B-DATE
just O
an O
angel O
. O

yeah O

but O
I O
mean O
that O
makes O
perfect O
sense O
. O

yeah O

I O
know O
it O
does O
. O

Like O
dogs O
. O

yeah O
. O

yeah O
. O

It O
was O
awful O

you O
know O
we O
may O
get O
cut O
off O
at O
some O
moment O

so O
uh-huh O
. O
if O
we O
do O
you O
know O
I O
'll O
call O
you O
when O
I O
get O
to O
Ashfield O
. O

okay O
. O

%um O
it O
was O
just O
awful O

I O
was O
stuck O
up O
on O
that O
hill O

%uh O
they O
only O
had O
the O
Legend O

uh-huh O
. O

and O
they O
kept O
telling O
me O
I O
did O
n't O
need O
to O
rent O
a O
car O
which O
I B-DATE
absolutely I-DATE
did I-DATE
. O

uh-huh O
. O

%um O
so O
anyway O
I O
did O
n't O
have O
my O
own O
transportation O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

They O
were O
buying O
a O
house O
. O

They O
have O
now O
bought O
a O
house O
. O

So B-DATE
they I-DATE
were I-DATE
just O
out O
driving O
around O
all O
day O
. O

They O
were O
completely O
stressed O
out O
. O

They O
had O
finished O
looking O
by O
the O
time O
I O
had O
got O
there O

but O
they O
were O
trying O
to O
make O
an O
offer O

uh-huh O
. O

and O
Alexis O
you O
know O
has O
no O
confidence O
about O
this O

uh-huh O
. O

and O
he O
had O
the O
most O
ridiculous O
realtor B-PERSON
you O
've O
ever O
seen O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

%um O
and O
%uh O
he O
hates O
owning O
property O

and O
he O
could O
only O
buy O
a O
house O
for O
three B-PERSON
hundred I-PERSON
and O
thirty O
thousand O
dollars B-PERSON
which O
was O
-- O
-- O
about O
half O
of O
what O
he O
wanted O
to O
spend O

and B-PERSON
%um O
he O
was O
a O
wreck O

uh-huh O
. O

and O
then O
Joel O
showed O
up O

uh-huh O
. O

Jemma O
was O
there O

and O
mom O
was O
picking O
on O
Jemma O
like O
she O
always O
does O
even O
though O
Jemma O
's O
a O
doll O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

Joel O
then O
turned O
up O
the O
day O
after O
I O
arrived B-CARDINAL
and I-CARDINAL
drove O
us O
mad O
. O

Drove O
us O
crazy O
. O

He O
was O
more O
obnoxious O
than O
he O
's O
ever O
been O
. O

uh-huh O

how O
do O
you O
know O
? O

You O
have O
n't O
seen O
him O
in O
ages B-GPE
. O

Well O
Jemma O
said O
so O
. O

I O
think O
I O
have O
greater O
tolerance O
for O
Joel O
than O
anyone O
in O
your O
family O
does O
. O

I O
think O
you O
do O
. O

I O
think O
you O
do O

but O
he O
really O
was O
a O
pain O
in O
the O
neck O

and O
Jemma O
said B-DATE
it O
's O
because O
his O
girlfriend O
just B-TIME
dumped O
him O
. O

uh-huh O
uh-huh O
. O

%um O
but O
anyway O

so O
mom O
and O
Alexis O
were O
freaking O
out O
because O
of O
that O

but O
they O
have O
no O
ability O
to O
set O
any O
limits O
you O
know O
. O

So O
like O
they O
ca O
n't O
say O
to O
Joel O
look O
you O
know O
go O
away O
for O
a O
while O

or O
I O
mean O
she O
could O
n't O
say O
to O
Judith O
no O
they O
ca O
n't O
come O
that O
week O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

you O
know O

and O
we O
were O
supposed O
to O
go O
out O
to B-CARDINAL
dinner O
one O
night O

and O
they O
showed O
up O
unexpectedly O
. O

They O
were O
supposed O
to O
be O
out O
. O

They O
had O
gone O
to O
the O
Grand O
Canyon O
, O
and O
did O
n't O
expect O
them O
back O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

And O
they O
showed O
up O
unexpectedly O

and O
you O
know O
mom O
and O
Alexis O
could O
not O
bring O
themselves O
to O
say O
we O
're O
taking O
Claire O
out O
to O
a O
nice O
dinner O

uh-huh O
. O

see O
you O
later O

this O
is O
our O
only O
evening O
with O
her O
yeah O
. O
you O
know O

we O
want O
to O
have O
some O
time O
with O
her O
. O

They O
could O
n't O
bring O
themselves O
to O
say O
that O

but O
they O
were O
so O
upset O
that O
he O
'd O
come O
back O
that O
the O
evening O
was O
just O
like O
a O
complete O

it O
was O
painful O
. O

Good O
. O

And O
we O
went O
to O
a O
different O
restaurant O
a O
cheap O
restaurant O

I O
mean O
it O
was O
just O
painful O

and O
I O
felt O
so O
pissed O
off O
because O
you O
know O
there O
I O
was O
expecting O
a O
family O
vacation O

I O
mean O
it O
's O
not O
so O
much O
Joel O

I O
mean O
oh O
well O
anyway O
yeah O

I O
mean O
it O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
a O
family O
vacation B-GPE

yeah O
. O

and O
it O
was O
like O
so O
stressful O

I O
mean O
I O
did O
n't O
know O
why O
I O
had O
bothered O
to O
go O
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
then O
you O
know O
Eve O
and O
Seth O
were O
down O
in O
their O
house O

and O
all O
of O
her O
energies O
seemed O
to O
be O
going O
towards O
protecting O
Eve O
from O
too O
many B-NORP
distractions O
uh-huh O
because O
Eve O
had O
to O
work O
. O

yeah O
. O

So O
you O
know O
you O
could O
n't O
go O
to O
Eve O
's O
house O

or O
you O
could O
n't O
ask O
Eve O
to O
have O
Joel O
and O
Jemma O
for O
a O
night O
uh-huh O
. O
although O
she O
was O
perfectly O
capable O
of O
having O
Guy O
and O
Jenny O
for O
a O
night O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

I O
was O
furious O
. O

And O
then O
Guy O
came O

and O
he O
was O
kind O
of O
a O
jerk O
you O
know O
. O

He O
was O
kind O
of O
harsh O
with O
me O
and O
%um O
you O
know O
just O
sort O
of O
not O
very O
sensitive O
and O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
help O
with O
Joel O
and O
Jemma B-PERSON
at O
all O
. O

We O
finally O
made O
him O
take O
them O
out O
for O
an O
afternoon O
. O

I O
mean O
it O
was O
all O
you O
know O
just O
ridiculous O
. O

and O
it O
was O
n't O
so O
great O
with O
Eve O
either O
. O

she O
said O
she O
wanted O
to O
spend O
a O
day O
with O
me O
. O

uh-huh O

you O
know O
I O
set O
aside O
the O
day O
she O
told O
me O

uh-huh O

and O
what O
it O
came O
down O
to O
was O
my O
going O
to O
her O
hairdresser O
with O
her O
uh-huh O
and O
sitting B-ORDINAL
there O
while O
she B-ORDINAL
talked O
to O
her O
hairdresser O
for O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
. O
and O
then O
going O
out O
to O
lunch O
with O
her O
and O
her O
babysitter B-PERSON
uh-huh O
Who O
brought O
the B-DATE
baby I-DATE
to O
meet O
us O

and O
I O
thought O
that O
the O
reason O
the O
babysitter B-PERSON
was O
staying B-PERSON
for O
lunch O
was O
because O
she O
would O
then O
take O
the O
baby O
away O
again O

Right O

But O
at O
the O
end O
of O
lunch O
, O
Eve O
just O
told O
her O
to O
go O
home O
. O

uh-huh O

So O
we O
'd O
have O
this O
two O
hour O
lunch O
with O
the O
babysitter B-PRODUCT
. O

uh-huh O

and O
then O
we O
had O
like O
half O
an O
hour O
to O
go O
into O
some O
shops O

and O
that O
was O
the O
end O
of O
the O
day O

And O
I O
mean O
%uh O
it O
was O
almost O
if O
she O
was O
protecting O
herself O
from O
spending O
time O
with O
me O
. O

yeah O

It O
was O
really O
weird O
. O

%um O
and O
then O
they B-DATE
wanted I-DATE
to O
borrow O
the O
Baby O
Bjorn O
for O
their O
ha- O

they O
're O
on O
a O
camping O
trip O
right O
now O
with O
the O
baby O
. O

uh-huh O

and O
I O
got O
kind O
of O
peeved O

and O
I O
decided O
I O
was O
n't O
going O
to O
lend O
it O
to O
them O

Well O
y- O

I O
mean O

I O
just O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
, O

Well O
anyway O
you O
use O
it O
, O
right B-PERSON
? O

Well O
I O
have O
n't O
used O
it O
on O
Long O
Island O
although O
I O
did O
think O
I O
was O
going O
to O
. O

Well O
but O
I O
mean O
what O
they O
were O
going O
to O
take O
it O
and O
then O
mail O
it O
back O
to O
you O

or O

yeah O

yeah O

but O
I O
was O
like O
forget O
it O

I O
'm O
going O
to O
lend O
this O
thing O
to O

No O

that O
's O
insane O
. O

No O

they B-ORG
can O
go O
fucking O
spend O
some O
of O
their O
own O
money O
for O
a O
change O

So O

'm O
fine O

How O
are O
you O
? O

I O
'm O
alright O

'm O

You O
sound O
really O
far O
away O
. O

I O
think O
this O
is O
a O
really O
bad O
connection O
because O
, O
there O
's O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
a O
lag O
. O

And O
it O
's O
really O
**staticky** O
. O

Do O
I O
sound O
**staticky** O
to O
you O
? O

No O
, O
you O
sound O
quite O
clear O
. O

oh O
. O

Well O
I O
suppose O

. O

I O
'll O
just O
have O

it O
then O
. O

kind O
of O

do O
you O
go O
through O
like O
a O
three B-CARDINAL

a O
lot O
of O
time O
with O

lot O
of O
fun O

very O
interesting O
, O
actually O
. O

I O
'll O
bet O
. O

she O
went O
across O
the B-LOC
Sahara I-LOC
desert I-LOC
by O
camel O
. O

, O
her O
husband O
is O
a O
writer O
, O

his O
name O
is O
Michael B-PERSON
Ascher I-PERSON
. O

Michael B-PERSON
what O
? O

Ascher B-PERSON

+unknown+ B-PERSON

Ascher B-PERSON
, O

Ascher O
, O

I O
've O
never O
heard O
of O
him O
. O

when O
they O
got O
married O
, O
their O
honeymoon O
was O
a O
nine O
month O
trip O
across O
the O
Sahara O
desert O
. O

Ugh O
. O

I O
think O
they O
started O
out O
in O
Morocco O
and O
made O
their O
way O
down O
and O
all O
the O
way O
%um O
, O
through O
the O
Sudan O
. O

oh O
my O
god O
! O

yeah O
. O

Can O
you O
imagine O
? O

yeah O
. O

oh O
yeah O
. O

I O
think O
she O
was O
%um O
, O
the O
first O
European O
woman O
to O
do O
that O
. O

oh O
my O
god O
. O

That O
must O
have O
been O
hellish O
. O

he O
wrote O
a O
book O
about O
it O
. O

%hm O
. O

So O

Is O
he O
American O
? O

No O
, O
he O
's O
English O
. O

uh-huh O

interesting O

so O
, O
her O
Arabic O
must O
be O
really O
good O
. O

It O
's O
pretty O
good O
. O

It O
's O
not O
any B-LANGUAGE
better O
than O
mine O
. O

Well O
, O
your O
Arabic O
is O
really O
good O
. O

it O
's O
gotten O
pretty O
good O
, O
actually O
. O

I O
've O
learned O
some O
interesting O
stuff O
here O
this O
year O
. O

Are O
you O
doing O
simultaneous O
stuff O
? O

No O
, O
we O
're O
not O
doing O
any O
simultaneous O
. O

Why O
not O
? O

Not O
at O
all O
. O

Because O
, O
%um O
, O
for O
one O
thing O
you O
have O
to O
be O
a O
lot O
better O
at O
Arabic O
than O
I O
am O
to O
do O
it O
. O

But O
, O
%um O
, O
mostly O
we O
spend O
most O
of O
our O
time O
on O
translation O
. O

%hm O
. O

And O
, O
only O
a O
very O
little O
bit O
on O
interpreting O
. O

And O
the O
interpreting O
we O
do O
is O
a O
consecutive O
liaison O
interpreting O
. O

What O
does O
that O
mean O
? O

It O
means O
that O
, O
%um O
, O
you O
, O
actually O
, O

it O

well O
you O
do O
it O
by O
paragraph O
. O

mhm O
. O

small O
bits O
of O
speech O
. O

And O
, O
in O
some O
ways O
, O
it O
's O
harder O
than O
simultaneous O
%um O
, O
because O
, O
you O
have O
to O
not O
only O
remember O
what O
was O
said O
, O
but O
you O
have O
to O
get O
all O
the O
facts O
right O
, O
you O
know O
? O

You O
ha- O

Right O
, O

right O
. O

You O
've O
got O
to O
remember O
it O
all O

and O

yeah O
, O

all O
the O
dates O
and O
amounts O
and O
, O
you O
know O
. O

So O
, O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
practice O
in O
note O
- O
taking O
, O
and O
devising O
your O
own O
sort O
of O
set O
of O
symbols O
that O
will O
jog O
your O
memory O
mhm O
. O
you O
know O
because O
you O
ca O
n't O
keep O
notes O
on O
a O
whole O
paragraph O
of O
what O
somebody O
says O
. O

Right O
. O

you O
just O
ca O
n't O
do O
it O
. O

It O
was O
very O
hard O
remember O
when O
we O
were O
waitressing O

I O
know O

I O
'm O
just O
shit O
labor O

cacca O
pay O

yeah O

And O
just O
because O
we O
're O
owners O
now O
nothing O
's O
changed O

I O
feel O
like O
an O
employee O
of O
our O
own O
you O
know O
endeavors O

aw O

So O
we O
were O
working O
really O
hard O

and O
what O
I O
was O
doing O
I O
would O
go O
in O
early O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
leave O
kind O
of O
around O
ten O
or O
eleven O
at O
night O

and O
Gabe O
would O
stay O
on O

and O
we O
'd O
close O
at O
one O
o'clock O
in O
the O
evening O

and O
he O
would O
stay O
until O
four O
or O
five O
and O
all O
these O
gorgeous O
young O
girls O
that O
you O
know O
he O
insisted O
on O
hiring O
young O
beautiful O
girls O

and O
I O
said O
Gabe O
this O
is O
going O
to O
be O
a O
problem O

you O
're O
just O
jealous O

I O
said O
I O
'm O
not O
jealous O

I O
feel O
shitty O
that O
you O
're O
not O
spending O
time O
with O
me O
and O
you O
're O
spending O
time O
with O
these O
girls O

and O
it O
's O
going O
to O
lead O
into O
a O
problem O

no O
you O
're O
just O
paranoid O

%mm O

Sure O
enough O
he O
you O
know O
started O
coming O
home O
four O
five O
six O
in O
the O
morning O

and O
I O
'm O
going O
what O
's O
going O
on O

he O
goes O
oh O
I O
just O
need O
to O
unwind O

and O
I O
said O
yeah O

talk O
to O
the O
girls O

yeah O

well O
you O
know O
they O
're O
so O
nice O
and O
so O
intelligent O

I O
said O
listen O

%hm O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
see O
a O
problem O
with O
that O
you O
better O
wake O
up O
I O
said O
because O
how O
would O
you O
feel O
if O
I O
stayed O
out O
until O
four O
or O
five O
in O
the O
morning O
talking O
to O
some O
young O
guys O
because O
you O
know O
I O
need O
the O
conversation O
need O
to O
unwind O

he O
say O
yeah O
I O
guess O
I O
'd O
be O
pissed O

I O
said O
well O
ditto O

mhm O

Anyway O

and O
then O
I O
would O
call O
him O
like O
at O
midnight O

and O
the O
phone O
would O
be O
busy O
in O
the O
restaurant O

I O
knew O
who O
it O
was O

it O
was O
the O
girl O

I O
mean O
she O
was O
so O
stupid O
and O
obvious O

yeah O

and O
come O
into O
the O
restaurant O

she O
'd O
see O
me O
jump O
up O
and O
leave O

she O
'd O
you O
know O
come O
visit O
on O
her O
off O
days O

and O
I O
was O
like O
yeah O
right O

yeah O

So O
I O
said O
to O
Gabe O
what O
's O
going O
on O

nothing O
nothing O
nothing O

then O
I O
called O
one O
day O

and O
the O
line O
was O
busy O

and O
I O
called O
his O
friend O
because O
he O
always O
uses O
him O
as O
an O
alibi O

and O
of O
course O
this O
guy O
was O
you O
know O
not O
busy O
on O
the O
phone O

%huh O
you O
're O
right O

And O
I O
called O
Gabe O
back O

and O
he O
said O
oh O
I O
was O
talking O
to O
that O
guy O

I O
said O
no O
you O
were O
n't O
. O

oh O

Yes O
I O
was O

I O
said O
no O
you O
were O
n't O

he O
goes O
%uh O

I O
was O
n't O

you O
want O
to O
know O

I O
said O
yeah O

he O
goes O
well O
I O
've O
been O
this O
girl O

oh O

I O
said O
that O
's O
it O

goodbye O

oh O

So O
it O
's O
been O
two O
and O
half O
weeks O

it O
's O
been O
hell O
because O
he O
's O
still O

he O
comes O
home O
six O
in O
the O
morning O

and O
I O
leave O
around O
seven O
or O
eight O
. O

So O
we O
have O
one O
or O
two O
hours O
together O

I O
try O
to O
spend O
all O
day O
because O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
see O
him O

and O
it O
's O
just O
been O
really O
hard O
because O
he O
's O
like O

let O
's O
talk O

and O
as O
far O
as O
I O
'm O
concerned O
we O

yeah O

He O

you O
know O
I O
never O
really O
wanted O
you O
physically O
you O
know O

if O
this O
is O
a O
problem O
then O
I O
guess O
the O
chemistry O
between O

has O
n't O
been O
good O

but O
I O
love O
you O
more O
than O
anybody O
else O
in O
the O
whole O
world O

I O
'm O
going O

think O
I O
deserve O
more O

bad O

but O
occasionally O
some O
things O
have O
got O
lost O

yeah O

Right O

anyway O
%um O

So O
%eh O
it O
was O
kind O
of O
upsetting O
because O
I O
had O
hoped O
that O
we O
could O
do O
some O
other O
fun O
things O
together O

we O
did O
n't O
take O

Dave O
was O
like O
we O
do O
n't O
have O
the O
time O

and O
we O
do O
n't O
have O
the O
money O

mhm O

and O
you O
know O
it O
turns O
out O
he O
just O
does O
n't O
want O
to O
spend O
any O
time O
alone O
with O
me O

mhm O

so O
he O
does O
n't O
want O
to O
because O
he O
says O
it O
makes O
him O
too O
anxious O
to O
go O
out O
with O
me O

So O
I O
said O
okay O

What O
am O
I O
going O
to O
do O
about O
this O
you O
know O

like O
what O
can O
I O
do O

how O
can O
I O
take O
a O
toss O

okay O
what O
does O
he O
like O
to O
do O

okay O
he O
likes O
to O
watch O
baseball O
on O
T O
V O

And O
I O
hate O
it O

for O
years O
I O
always O
just O
go O
in O
the O
bedroom O
and O
read O
when O
he O
does O
it O
in O
the O
summertime O
. O

mhm O

But O
I O
said O
okay O
I O
'll O
watch O
baseball O
with O
him O

So O
I O
sat O
there O

and O
you O
know O
what O
I O
realized O

Right O

I O
did O
n't O
really O
put O
it O
together O
over O
the O
Summer O

but O
he O
stopped O
watching O
baseball O

oh O

Every O
other O
Summer O
we O
've O
been O
together O
every O
single O
night O
he O
spent O
watching O
baseball O

mhm O

And O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
sit O
down O
and O
do O
it O
with O
him O
he O
stops O

%mm O

mhm O

Anyway O
so O
we O
did O
n't O
spend O
any O
time O
together O

and O
then O
we O
went O
to O
England O

and O
his O
parents O
were O
really O
mean O
to O
me O

oh O

And O
Dave O
just O
said O
well O
because O
we O
split O
up O
I O
need O
to O
earn O
my O
way O
back O
to O
the O
family O

mhm O

He O
said O
it O
's O
understandable O
that O
they O
should O
be O
angry O
with O
me O

because O
you O
took O
his O
son O
away O
from O
him O

What O
did O
I O
do O

I O
mean O
when O
I O
left O
with O
his O
son O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
it O
was O
you O
know O
with O
his O
understanding O

mhm O

it O
was O
supposedly O
an O
agreement O
we O
made O
together O
that O
he O
approved O
of O

yeah O

So O
why O
are O
his O
parents O
punishing O
me O

%hm O

They O
were O
really O
dreadful O
and O
very O
very O
cold O

And O
you O
know O
I O
have O
just O
been O
so O
devoted O
and O
so O
loving O

I O
mean O
I O
'm O
taking O
this O
huge O
trip O
to O
go O
see O
them O
yeah O
as O
my O
only O
vacation O

we O
spent O
all O
of O
our O
money O
to O
go O
do O
that O
you O
know O

And O
they O
treat O
you O
like O
shit O

And O
they O
treated O
me O
like O
shit O

and O
it O
was O
very O
upsetting O

thanks O
a O
lot O
al O

and O
I O
do O
n't O
believe O

And O
Dave O
did O
n't O
stand O
up O
for O
me O
. O

You O
know O
what O
I O
mean O
. O

mhm O

And O
then O
afterwards O
everyone O
was O
very O
upset O

and O
he O
did O
n't O
you O
know O
say O
oh O
they O
were O
wrong O
to O
treat O
you O
that O
way O
You O
know O

nothing O
like O
that O

What O
was O
his O
reasoning O

Right O

well O
what O
is O
it O

I O
mean O
he O
says O
well O
they O
're O
mad O
at O
you O

and O
you O
know O
I O
mean O
he O
says O
it O
like O
you O
know O
because O
he O
's O
English O
so O
he O
does O
n't O
spell O
it O
all O
out O
you O
know O

yeah O

But O
he O
says O
it O
and O
leaves O
it O
open O
for O
me O
to O
infer O
that O
he O
agrees O
with O
them O

%mm O

And O
then O
he O
does O
n't O
contradict O
it O
You O
know O

and O
I O
say O
do O
you O
agree O
with O
them O

and O
he O
does O
n't O
say O
anything O
you O
know O

that O
kind O
of O
thing O

yeah O

yeah O

%um O
So O
they O
're O
coming O
for O
three O
weeks O

I O
'm O
supposed O
to O
spend O
My O
Christmas O
vacation O
in O
Texas O
with O
them O

mhm O

They O
're O
coming O
for O
three O
weeks O
the O
only O
time O
that O
we O
both O
have O
free O

mhm O

and O
meanwhile O
it O
's O
like O
he O
just O
ignores O
me O
when O
we O
're O
around O
them O

and O
I O
end O
up O

three O
of O
the O
days O
we O
were O
there O
he O
and O
his O
brother O
and O
his O
father O
sat O
and O
watched O
cricket O
all O
day O

and O
I O
had O
to O
like O
clean O
the O
house O
and O
do O
the O
cooking O
and O
watch O
Sam O

I O
know O

%mm O

You O
know O
it O
's O
incredible O

And O
this O
is O
my O
only O
vacation O

yeah O

So O
I O
'm O
supposed O
to O
spend O
my O
Christmas O
vacation O
which O
is O
the O
only O
time O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
get O
to O
see O
him O
yeah O
with O
them O

and O
I O
said O
I O
ca O
n't O
do O
it O

and O
%um O
Then O
I O
told O
him O
that O
I O
really O
wanted O
him O
to O
come O
up O
for O
Christmas O
mhm O
So O
we O
can O
all O
be O
together O
for O
Christmas O

and O
I O
just O
ca O
n't O
be O
with O
them O
every O
time O

I O
mean O
I O
really O
struggled O
with O
it O

I O
really O
tried O
to O
get O
psyched O
myself O
to O
do O
it O

every O
time O
I O
thought O
about O
it O
I O
'd O
just O
burst O
into O
tears O

yeah O

You O
know O
I O
love O
Christmas O

and O
thing O
is O
that O
I O
loved O
these O
people O

mhm O

I O
really O
loved O
them O

and O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
could O
turn O
on O
me O
like O
that O
showed O
me O
that O
they O
never O
really O
cared O
about O
me O
they O
obviously O
never O
approved O
of O
me O

or O
why O
would O
they O
be O
treating O
me O
like O
this O

No O
no O

I O
think O

They O
should O
be O
so O
happy O
that O
we O
're O
back O
together O
right O
? O

yeah O

but O
maybe O
at O
the O
time O
they O
took O
their O
son O
's O
side O

and O
you O
know O
they O
thought O
oh O
my O
gosh O
you O
know O
she O
took O
the O
child O
away O

and O
she O
hurt O
I O
mean O

Right O
. O

Parents O
always O
take O
a O
boy O
's O
side O

they O
always O
take O
the O
you O
know O

I O
know O

I O
know O

but O
it O
just O
really O
hurt O
that O
they O
could O
just O
turn O
on O
me O
like O
that O

I O
mean O
I O
think O
that O
they O
should O
have O
seen O
that O
I O
'm O
sure O
you O
know O
maybe O
this O
was O
nobody O
's O
fault O
maybe O
it O
was O
both O
of O
our O
faults O

and O
certainly O
they O
should O
be O
very O
happy O
for O
all O
of O
us O
that O
we O
're O
together O
again O
and O
support O
us O
Absolutely O
Instead O
of O
Did O
you O
try O
talking O
to O
them O
punishing O
me O

No O

because O
I O
did O
n't O
really O
realize O
what O
was O
going O
on O
when O
we O
were O
there O

I O
just O
knew O
I O
was O
feeling O
bad O

yeah O

And O
because O
they O
're O
so O
indirect O

mhm O

They O
have O
this O
weird O
English O
oh O
no O
we O
're O
nice O
and O
polite O

yeah O

yeah O

yeah O

but O
meanwhile O
cold O
like O
ice O

yeah O

exactly O

yeah O

exactly O

So O
it O
was O
very O
hard O
to O
put O
it O
together O

and O
Dave O
was O
the O
one O

I O
thought O
that O
they O
were O
being O
very O
%um O
disapproving O
of O
Sam O

but O
Dave O
was O
the O
one O
who O
told O
me O
no O
it O
was O
me O

I O
mean O
most O
the O
stuff O
I O
'm O
getting O
about O
them O
I O
'm O
getting O
from O
him O

oh O

So O
I O
do O
n't O
even O
know O
like O
what O

is O
he O
just O
trying O
to O
make O
me O
feel O
bad O

you O
know O
what O
I O
mean O

yeah O

but O
I O
think O
that O
it O
's O
true O

I O
mean O
at O
some O
time O
he O
could O
be O
doing O
things O
to O
help O
keep O
me O
from O
feeling O
so O
bad O
You O
know O

mhm O

Like O
he O
does O
n't O
have O
to O
tell O
me O
all O
these O
things O

I O
think O
he O
really O
wanted O
me O
to O
feel O
bad O

he O
really O
wanted O
me O
to O
be O
punished O
mhm O
You O
know O

and O
what O
did O
I O
do O

I O
mean O
I O
was O
the O
one O
who O
got O
us O
back O
together O

and O
I O
bent O
over O
backwards O
to O
make O
the O
relationship O
work O

I O
've O
done O
everything O
he O
said O
I O
was O
doing O
wrong O
that O
was O
keeping O
him O
from O
being O
happy O

Well O

nah O
it O
does O
n't O
work O
that O
way O

%hm O
I O
know O
it O
does O
n't O

but O
you O
know O
it O
's O
like O
uch O
it O
's O
just O
all O
a O
mess O

and O
it O
's O
disgusting O

But O
anyway O

so O
that O
's O
been O
the O
most O
recent O

So O
how O
do O
you O
feel O
about O
them O

is O
it O
okay O

now O
it O
's O
okay O

How O
are O
you O
handling O
all O
this O
stuff O

you O
know O
I O
feel O
completely O
broken O
- O
hearted O
and O
devastated O

yeah O

well O

I O
really O
do O

I O
feel O
like O
I O
have O
put O
my O
life O
into O
this O
relationship O

I O
spent O
seven O
years O
with O
him O

I O
had O
a O
child O
with O
him O

mhm O
. O

You O
know O
I O
've O
devoted O
myself O
to O
him O
. O

and O
%um O
I O
do O
n't O
know O

I O
had O
so O
much O
invested O
in O
this O
you O
know O

yeah O

yup O

I O
just O
feel O
like O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
I O
can O
ever O
really O
recover O
from O
it O
because O
it O
's O
just O
been O
such O
a O
enormous O
colossal O
failure O
You O
know O

Well O
then O
why O
force O
it O

maybe O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
better O
with O
somebody O
else O

oh O
no O

we O
're O
not O
I O
mean O

yeah O

yeah O

no O
no O

because O
actually O
I O
know O
him O
Sara O

I O
've O
done O
nine O
and O
half O
years O
with O
Gabe O

yeah O

that O
's O
right O

and O
it O
really O
does O
feel O
like O
I O
have O
done O
nothing O
to O
change O
him O

I O
know O

You O
know O
I O
've O
been O
trying O
to O
help O
him O
fix O
him O

but O
I O
said O
to O
him O
you O
know O
what O

you O
're O
a O
typical O
Hungarian O
male O

oh O
this O
is O
perfect O
timing O
because O
%um O
my O
baby O
's O
sleeping O

's O
great O
. O

oh O
good O
. O

all O

was O
the O
last O
day O

've O
had O
this O

to O
know O
what O
it O
was O
like O
to O
live O
other O
places O
and O
enjoyed O
other O
places O

and O
now O
it O
makes O
it O
more O
enjoyable O
to O
be O
back O
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
it O
was O
just O
right O
. O

We O
'd O
been O
praying O
for O
years O
what O
we O
were O
supposed O
to O
do O
. O

We O
always O
thought O
we O
were O
going O
to O
move O
to O
Denver B-GPE
and O
live O
in O
my O
grandmother O
's O
house O
that O
had O
died O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

But O
that O
did O
n't O
work O
out O

and O
about B-DATE
two I-DATE
months I-DATE
ago I-DATE
one O
morning O
I O
told O
Barry B-PERSON
I O
said O
honey O
I O
said O
really O
think O
that O
we O
're O
to O
move O
to O
Casper B-GPE

and O
the O
next O
day O
I O
talked O
to O
my O
granny O

and O
she O
had O
moved O
up O
here O
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
mhm O
. O
to O
be O
by O
mom O

and O
she O
said O
she O
had O
felt O
that O
for O
a O
whole O
year O
after O
praying O
that O
we O
were O
to O
move O
here O
too O

she O
just O
had O
never O
said O
anything O
to O
anybody O
. O

mhm O
. O

And O
so O
she O
told O
me O
she O
had O
thought O
we O
should O
look O
for O
a O
house O
that O
had O
a O
big O
backyard O
and O
apartments O
that O
we O
could O
rent O
to O
pay O
the O
mortgage O
that O
she O
just O
thought O
there O
would O
be O
one O
we O
could O
find O
like O
that O

so O
we O
started O
looking O
on O
vacation O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks B-DATE
ago I-DATE

and O
we O
found O
one O

it O
's O
a B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
and I-CARDINAL
fifty I-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL

and O
I O
said O
granny O
I O
said O
we O
ca O
n't O
afford O
that O

she O
said O
well O
you O
know O
if O
that O
's O
what O
God O
wants O
he O
'll O
provide O
it O

so O
we O
did O
all O
the O
paperwork O

and O
the O
bank O
turned O
us O
down O

but O
then O
we O
did O
find O
the O
house O
. O

We O
found O
another O
one O
for O
half O
the O
price O
for O
sixty B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
six I-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL

had O
two B-CARDINAL
apartments O
in O
the O
back O
that O
the O
lady O
had O
fixed O
up O
brand O
new O
and O
a O
big O
backyard O
for O
the O
kids O
with O
a O
big O
cedar O
fence O

just O
like O
grandma O
had O
thought O
we O
should O
have O
we O
found O
it O

and O
we O
are O
getting O
the O
house O
. O

That O
's O
great O
. O

yep O

she O
had O
prayed O

Are O
you O
staying O
with O
your O
mom O
at O
the O

And O
about B-DATE
two I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
before O

moved O
here O
she O
called O
me O
at O
home O

and O
she O
said O
she O
'd O
been O
praying O
all O
morning O
for O
us O

and O
she O
said O
Alison B-PERSON
she O
said O
I O
just O
felt O
real O
strong O
I O
needed O
to O
call O
and O
tell O
you O
that O
God O
's O
taking O
you O
to O
your O
promised O
land O

and O
she O
said O
%um O

see O
she O
does O
n't O
know O
my O
personal O
life O
you O
know O

we O
just O
share O

you O
know O
what O
I O
mean O

but O
she O
does O
n't O
know O
like O
me O
personally O
you O
know O
everything O
about O
us O

but O
it O
was O
amazing O
the O
insight O
she O
had O
into O
us O

you O
know O
she O
said O
God O
showed O
me O
that O
you O
guys O
made O
the O
best O
out O
of O
Omaha B-GPE
and O
you O
were O
like O
the O
children O
of O
Israel B-GPE

did O
n't O
complain O
and O
kick O
and O
scream O
in O
the O
wilderness O
you O
know O
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
so O
because O
you O
trusted O
God O
and O
made O
the O
best O
of O
it O
he O
's O
taking O
you O
to O
your O
promised O
land O
quicker O
than O
if O
you O
'd O
complained O
the O
whole O
time O

and O
she O
just O
had O
this O
wonderful O

oh O
it O
just O
gave O
me O
chills O
all O
over O
. O

I O
started O
crying O
. O

oh O
. O

and O
she O
said O
so O
you O
know O
just O
trust O
Him O
because O
he O
's O
taking O
you O
to O
where O
he O
wants O
you O
to O
be O
because O
you O
were O
faithful O
you O
know O
in O
Omaha B-GPE
and O
it O
was O
kind O
of O
like O
a O
wilderness O
. O

We O
did O
make O
the O
best O
of O
it O
you O
know O
. O

yeah O
. O

But O
her O
insight O
was O
so O
perceptive O
. O

I O
started O
crying O
. O

I O
was O
like O
oh O
that O
's O
wonderful O
. O

And O
so O
then O
she O
says O
well O
we O
love O
you O

good O
bye O
. O

aw O
. O

And O
that O
is O
what O
it O
was O
like O
too O
you O

. O

We O
made O
the O
best O
of O
it O
tried O
not O
to O
complain O
You O
really O
have O
to O
yeah O
. O
and O
made O
the O
best O
of O
it O

and O
then O
this O
is O
like O
the O
promised O
land O
to O
us O
. O

It O
might O
not O
be O
to O
someone O
else O

. O

mhm O

But O
for O
us O

it O

because O
he O
was O
teasing O
me O
and O
saying O
we O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
use O
anything O
because O
it O
's O
impossible O
to O

she O
'll O

and O
the O
day O
before O

I O
got O
a O
phone O
call O
from O
the O
university O
here O
that O
I O
used O

them O

My O

Right O

and O
they O
needed O
somebody O

was O
actually O
starting O
kind O
of O
like O
the O
week O
I O
was O
supposed O
to O
have O
the O
baby O

so O
they O
gave O
me O
two B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
off O

and O
then O
I O
've O
started O
doing O
that O

and O
it O
's O
only O
one B-CARDINAL
day O
a O
week O

and O
it O
's O
for O

like O

three B-CARDINAL
classes O

and O
then O
they O
pay O
me O
to O
mark O

so O
like O
in O
the B-DATE
fourteen I-DATE

doing O
that O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
make O
about O
%um O
oh O
it O
's O
nice O

little O
less O
than O
three O

dollars O

so O
the O
Lord O
's O
really O
looked O
after O
me O
that O
way O

that O
will O
practically O
pay O
for O
my O

. O

And O
I O
finish O
right O
before O

I O
do O

yeah O
i- O
because O
it O
really O
goes O
into O

%um O
if B-PERSON
you O

you O
know O
it O
must O
have O
started O
with O
one O
little O
fucking O
flea O
you O
know O

%uh O
it O
's O
really O
bizarre O
the O
whole O
story O
how O
it O
got O
in O
there O

you O
know O
it O
's O
like O
the O
thing O

like O
I O
was O
horrified O
when O
Kristen O
told O
me O

and O
I O
was O
even O
getting O
mad O

and O
I O
was O
like O
saying O
like O
did O
n't O
you O
ever O
clean O
the O
place O
. O
you O
know O

and O
apparently O
it O
does O
n't O
have O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
that O
No O
like O
if O
the O
place O
is O
clean O
or O
not O
you O
know O

No O

and O
my O
sister O
Lisa O
said O
that O
her O
house O
has O
been O
infested O
%um O
several O
times O
with O
fleas O
while O
they O
were B-CARDINAL
living O
in O
it O
just O
because O
of O
the O
dog O
you O
know O

and O
%um O
the O
dog O
was O
always O
running O
around O
outside O

and O
you O
know O
the O
place O
gets O
completely O
%um O
infested O

and O
she O
had O
to O
bomb O
while O
they O
were O
living O
there O

and O
what O
they O
did O
was O
they O
bombed O
everything O
but O
the O
kitchen O
you O
know O

mhm O

and O
then O
%um O
like O
they O
put O
down O
a O
plastic O
thing O
over O
the O
dining O
room O
table O
and O
things O
like O
that O

and O
you O
know O
it O
's O
like O

and O
you O
just O
lived O
in O
the O
poison O
afterwards O

and O
she O
said O
well O
yeah O
you O
know O

%um O
that O
's O

yeah O

well O
I O
mean O
all O
you O
can O
do O
is O
like O
just O
wash O
everything O
do O
a O
Spring O
clean O
when O
you O
get O
that O

yeah O

yeah O

yeah O

Well O
when O
I O
get O
back O
you O
know O
I O
mean O
if O
Tamara O
washed O
the B-GPE
plates I-GPE
that O
's O
very O
nice O

but O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
take O
them O
all O
out O

and O
then O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
wash O
down O
that O
%um B-GPE
you I-GPE
know O
that O
thing O

and O
%uh O
I O
'm O
supposed O
to O
be O
speaking O
native O
English O
. O

Well O
she O
did O
that O

she O
did O
that O

the O
kitchen O
shelf O
the O
white O
one O

though O
she B-ORDINAL
did O
n't O
get O
everything O
out O
of O
the O
cupboard O

and O

I O
mean O
you O
still O
have O
to O
do O
that O
. O

yeah O

the O
white O

no O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
you O
have O
to O
do O
that O
really O

I O
mean O
we O
do O
n't O
use O
those O

You O
know O
we O
noticed O
afterwards O
that O
the O
door O
was O
a O
little O
bit O
open O
you O
know O
one O
of O
the O
doors O

so O

yeah O

so O
that O
's O
okay O

but O
%um O
I O
think O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
's O
in O
there O
are O
glasses O

we O
wash O
the O
glasses O

yeah O

yeah O

but O
that O
's O
so O
sweet O
of O
her O

I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
she O
did O
that O

oh O

it O
's O
okay O

oh O
Christian O

he O
's O
like O
%um O
mhm B-NORP
getting I-NORP
a O
little O
bit O
tired O
of O

here O
because O
like O
it O
's O
so O
hard O
to B-NORP
%um O
break O
into O
the O
scene O

like O
there B-NORP
's I-NORP
so O
many O
musicians O
here O
that O
even O
if O
you O
go O
to O
like O
a O
session O
and O
you O
play O
really O
good O
and O
people O
see O
that O
you O
're O
playing O
good O
and B-NORP
turn O
their O
heads O
and O
stuff O
like O
that O
, O
nobody B-NORP
comes O
up O
to O
him B-NORP
and I-NORP
asks O
him O
who O
he B-NORP
is O
-- O
yeah O
-- O
because O
they O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
know O
anybody O
new O
you O
know O

it O
's O
like O
they O
do O

like O

but O

yeah O

I O
sit O
here O

and O
I O
do O
n't O
even O
know O
that O
she O
's O
under O
the O
material O

oh O
god O

and B-LANGUAGE
then O
I O
'll O
let O
my O
arm O
hanging O
down O

and O
then O
she O
like O
you O
know O
jumps O
at O
my O
arm O
and O
starts O

and O
she O
thinks O
I O
want O
to O
play O
with O
her O

and O
then O
sometimes O
I O
'm O
just O
really O
like O
shocked O

she O
's O
very O
very O
playful O

yeah O

she O
's O
very O
playful O

oh O
%uh O

that O
's O
going O
to O
be O
nice O
to O
see O
Lilly O
again O

we O
have O
two O
cats B-GPE
here O

and O
one O
them O
is O
kind O
of O
dumb O

So O
, O
how O
are O
you O
? O

I O
'm O
fine O
. O

I O
'm O
very O
fine O
. O

How O
are O
you O
? O

I O
have O
n't O
talked O
to O
you O
in O
a O
long O
time O
. O

I O
feel O
like O
I O
talk O
to O
David B-PERSON
almost O
every O
day O
. O

yeah O

Is O
n't O
that O
wild O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
it O

there O
's O
really O
no O
difference O
between O
writing O
a O
letter O
and O
the O
way O
we O
correspond O
. O

As O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
what O
I O
do O
is O
I O
sit O
down O
and O
write O
a O
letter O
at O
my O
own O
leisure O
, O
you O
know O
, O
at O
the O
word O
processor O

and O
then O
late O
at O
night O
I O
send O
it O
on O
email O
-- O

Right O

-- O
and O
there O
's O
really O
no O
reason O
why O
we O
could O
n't O
have O
written O
letters O
like O
this O
all O
these O
years O
and O
put O
them O
in O
the O
mailbox O
. O

Well O
, O
you O
know O
what O

I O
do O
n't O

I O
do O
n't O
know O

there O
's O
something O
about O
this O
that O
's O
easier O
, O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
to O
explain O
it O
. O

That O
you O
find O
the O
email O
is O
easier O
? O

yeah O
, O

it O
's O
this O
I O
guess O
that O
it O
's O
no O
different O
except O
that O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
go O
out O
and O
get O
stamps O
and O
put O
it O
in O
the O
mailbox O
. O

I O
think O
also O
you O
know O
that O
someone O
's O
going O
to O
be O
reading O
it O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
not O
possibly O
in B-DATE
a I-DATE
week I-DATE
. O

you O
know O
that O
what O
you O
're O
saying O
is O
going O
to O
be O
heard O
. O

Sometimes O
when O
you O
write O
a O
letter O
you O
figure O
eventually O
they O
're O
going O
to O
get O
this O
and O
it O
's O
already O
going O
to O
be O
old O
news O

and O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
're O
really O
communicating O
with O
email O
. O

yeah O
. O

Kind O
of O
, O

%eh O
even O
though O
there O
is O
a O
delay O
. O

But O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
it O
's O
like O
cute O
. O

Also O
I O
get O
a O
kick O
out O
of O
pressing O
all O
those O
buttons O
and O
everything O
. O

So O
tell O
me O
. O

okay O
, O

first O
what O
you O
have O

to O
start O
off O
tell O
me O
about O
all O
your O
kids O
. O

Start O
at O
the O
beginning O
. O

Or O
should O
I O

I O
'll O
start O
at O
the O
end O
. O

okay O
. O

Avi O
is O
very O
cute O
. O

yeah O

like O
, O
%um O
, O
he O
's O
nine B-DATE
months I-DATE
old I-DATE
already O
. O

oh O
, O
my O
God O
. O

Believe O
it O
or O
not O
. O

What O
's O
he O
doing O
? O

Tell O
me O
every- O

He O
's O
only O
like O
seven B-DATE
months I-DATE
old I-DATE
. O

Right O
. O

But O
the O
truth O
is O
, O
like O
all O
my O
children O
, O
he O
's O
really O
only O
like O
five B-DATE
months I-DATE
old I-DATE
. O

He O
's O
a O
lump O
on O
a O
log O
. O
I O
would O
be O
surprised O

oh O
he O
's O
very O
alert O
, O

he O
's O
very O
alert O
%um O
and O
very O
responsive O
and O
laughs O
and O
eats O
well O
. O

Hello O
? O

No O
, O
I O
'm O
here O
, O

I O
just O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
interrupt O
because O
I O
hate O
that O
echo O
thing O
. O

okay O
. O

okay O
. O

%ah O
, O
%uh O
but O
he O
does O
n't O
move O
. O

okay O
, O

well O
that O
's O
normal O
, O

you O
're O
not O
worried O
about O
that O

That O
's O
all O
your O
kids O

No O

but O
you O
know O
because O
he O
was O
premature O
, O
he O
's O
getting O
a O
lot O
of O
attention O
. O

Right O
. O

So O
we O
go O
to O
physical O
therapy O
once O
a O
week O
, O

and O
the O
truth O
is O
what O
I O
'm O
learning O
about O
it O
oh O
because O
I O
spend O
so O
much O
time O
with O
the O
physical O
therapist O
is O
that O
all O
my O
kids O
could O
have O
used O
physical O
therapy O
in O
this O
case O
. O

The O
truth O
is O
we O
could O
all O
use O
physical O
therapy O
because O
it O
would O
all O
make O
us O
more O
balanced O
people O
between O
the O
right O
and O
our O
left O
hemispheres O

and O
something O
about O
being O
organized O
internally O
gets O
you O
organized O
ext- O

I O
've O
learned O
a O
lot O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O

half O
of O
it O
is O
probably O
baloney O
, O

but O
if O
any O
of O
it O
's O
true O
they O
all O
needed O
physical O
therapy O
. O

At O
a O
very O
young O
age O
. O

oh O
god O
. O

How O
often O
do O
you O
have O
to O
take O
him O
? O

No O

because O
they O
do O
n't O
like O
to O
pl- O

How O
often O
do O
you O
take O
him O
? O

I O
take O
him O
once O
a O
week O

I O
'm O
sorry O
, O

what O
? O

Once O
a O
week O
. O

Once O
a O
week O
. O

okay O
. O

mhm O

%um O
and O
, O
%uh O
he O
does O
n't O
like O
to O
play O
on O
his O
stomach O
, O

he O
only O
likes O
to O
be O
on O
his O
back O
. O

Right O
. O

So O
as O
soon O
as O
you O
put O
him O
on O
it O
, O
he O
can O
lift O
his O
head O
and O
everything O

and O
now O
he O
's O
starting O
to O
extend O
his O
hands O
out O
even O

Right O

but O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
gets O
that O
toy O
, O
he O
just O
rolls O
over O
to O
play O
with O
it O
on O
his O
back O
. O

oh O
. O

So O
%uh O
. O

No O
, O

but O
%uh O
they O
were O
all O
like O
that O
, O
every O
one O
of O
them O
. O

So O
you O
do O
n't O
think O
personally O
it O
has O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
him O
being O
premature O
? O

Personally O
, O
no O
. O

mhm O

No O
. O

But O
it O
does O
n't O
hurt O
. O

But O
I O
see O
. O

Right O
, O

but O
I O
see O
that O
the O
he- O

no O
but O
it O
's O
helping O

mhm O
. O

It O
's O
helping O
him O
be O
more O
, O

he O
's O
advancing O
better O
, O
I O
think O
. O

Right O
. O

Who O
knows O
? O

And O
physically O
he O
's O
feeling O
good O
? O

Do O
n't O
know O
. O

We O
'll O
find O
out O
. O

Physically O
he O
's O
fine O
? O

yeah O
. O

He O
's O
fine O
. O

He O
's O
fine O
. O

Fine O
, O
fine O
. O

He O
was O
sick O
. O
once O
with O
%um O
an O
ear O
infection O

and O
once O
he O
got O
this O
cough O

and O
he O
was O
like O
asthmatic O
. O

mhm O
. O

So O
you O
know O
, O
he O
had O
to O
have O
you O
know O
%eh O
a O
mask O
thing O
%hm O
and O
these O
%eh O
you O
know O

but O
it O
was O
n't O

no O

at O
home O
, O

nothing O
serious O
, O

Right O
. O

Right O
. O

%uh O
but O
%eh O
because O
those O
things O
usually O
return O
and O
it O
usually O
is O
a O
condition O
. O

You O
know O
, O
they O
prepared O
me O
for O
that O
and O
said O
oh O
you O
know O
, O
but O
because O
millions O
of O
kids O
here O
have O
it O
Right O
a O
lot O
of O
kids O
and O
a O
lot O
of O
Hagim O
a O
lot O
of O
%uh O
preemies O
get O
it O
. O

%hm O

But O
he O
has O
n't O
had O
another O
attack O
since O
, O

so O
it O
was O
fair O
to O
assume O
then O
it O
was O
a O
one O
time O
thing O
, O
too O
. O

And O
how O
did O
the O

They O
said O

Well O
, O
wait O
. O

How O
do O
the O
kids O
deal O
with O
him O
? O

Are O
they O
happy O
with O
him O
? O

Are O
they O
getting O
jealous O
of O
him O
? O

Are O
they O
okay O
? O

oh O
, O
yeah O
, O

they O
're O
fine O
. O

They O
're O
big O
. O

You O
know O
, O
they O
're O
not O
%uh O

Right O
. O

What O
about O
Jochanan B-PERSON
? O

At O
the O
beginning O

Jochanan B-PERSON
's O
five B-DATE
year's I-DATE
old I-DATE
. O

I O
know O
. O

Jochanan B-PERSON
liked O
him O

Jochanan O
liked O
him O
pretty O
much O
right O
away O
. O

Everyone O
you O
know O
they O
invested O
so O
much O
in O
him O
, O
too O
. O

At O
the O
beginning O
%um O
, O
it O
was O
as O
if O
there O
was O
a O
novelty O
, O
because O
they O
waited O
so O
long O
to O
bring O
him O
home O
. O

mhm O

Right O
. O

And O
then O
you O
know O
the O
novelty O
's O
worn O
off O
, O
which O
is O
good O
. O

Right O

It O
wore O
off O
a O
long O
time O
ago O
. O

And O
he O
says O
%uh O
you O
know O
lots O
of O
people O
have O
babies O
in O
their O
houses O
. O

It O
's O
you O
know O
, O
they O
're O
just O
another O
family O
with O
a O
baby O
in O
the O
house O
. O

Right O
. O

And O
that O
was O
good O
. O

That O
's O
the O
way O
it O
should O
be O
. O

How O
do O
you O
have O
the O
kids O
in O
the O
house O
? O

Who O
's O
in O
which O
room O
? O

Well O
, O
Uriel O
was O
in O
a O
room O
before O
Gabby B-PERSON
came O
home O
. O

Uriel O
was O
in O
a O
room O
by O
himself O
. O

mhm O
. O

And O
Noam B-PERSON
and O
Jochanan B-PERSON
shared O
. O

Right O
. O

But O
before O
we O
brought O
the O
baby O
home O
, O
we O
switched O
it O
, O
because O
Uriel B-PERSON
's O
room O
was O
like O
a O
bacteria O
haven O
. O

when O
I O
was O
up O
it O
was O
a O
few O
weeks O
before O
we O
brought O
him O
home O

we O
cleaned O
out O
the O
room O
to O
switch O

and O
you O
know O
I O
said O
, O
we O
could O
n't O
put O
any O
baby O
in O
this O
room O
. O

Poor O
Noam B-PERSON
got O
him O
back O

and O
Jochanan B-PERSON
you O
know O
you O
can O
control O
it O
better O
. O

So O
it O
's O
Jochanan B-PERSON
and O
Gabby B-PERSON
and O
Uriel B-PERSON
and O
Noam B-PERSON
. O
the O
way O
they O
used O
to O
be O
together O
. O

okay O
. O

So O
you O
still O
have O
your O
office O
as O
your O
office O
? O

Right O
. O

I O
'm O
sitting O
in O

's O
with O
your O
working O
? O

What O
's O
your O
new O
working O
thing O
? O

depressing O

It O
's O
depressing O
. O

Is O
it O
depressing O

or O

it O
give O
you O
a O
lot O
of O
anxiety O
? O

%mm O

A O
and O
B O

All O
of O
the O
above O
. O
I O
also O
have O
taboo O
subjects O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
talk O
about O
. O

No O
, O

I O
do O
n't O
mind O
talking O
about O
it O
, O

but O
I O
ca O
n't O
jam O
it O
into O
fifteen B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
. O

That O
's O
too O
depressing O
. O

%um O
. O
Well O
, O
we O
have O
half B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME
. O

I O
mean O
, O
we O
could O
talk O
for O
half B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME
, O

it O
's O
just O
that O
we O
have O
to O
guarantee O
them O
fifteen B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
, O

so O
, O
%uh O

has O
his O
own O
number O

have O
a O
half O
an O
hour O
. O

It O

nothing O
to O
do O
with O
him O
. O

It O
's O
very O
depressing O
and O
very O
anxiety O
- O
ridden O
. O

Well O

summed O
it O
up O
. O

So O

Thorazine B-PRODUCT
? O

. O

I O
hate O
being O
home O

I O
hate O

. O

I O
really O
do O
. O

I O
hate O
being O
home O
. O

You O
hate O
being O
home O
. O

You O
feel O
like O
you O
want O
more O
people O
interaction O
? O

%eh O
it O
's O
the O
lot O
well O
of O

first O
of O
all O
, O
I O
'm O
upset O
about O
what O
happened O
. O

mhm O

I O
'm O
upset O
. O

Now O
I O
'm O
upset O
, O

I O
was O
n't O
upset O
so O
much O
when O
it O
happened O
because O
at O
the O
time O
I O
was O
just O
taking O
everything O
in O
stride O
and O
everything O
you O
know O

gomzila O
tova O

and O
everything O
will O
be O
okay O
because O
%eh O
the O
baby O
was O
still O
in O
the O
hospital O

mhm O

and O
you O
know O
I O
was O
still O
recovering O
from O
a O

Well O
, O
you O
're O
not O
working O
at O
all O
now O
? O

Like O
, O
it O
was O
a O
really O
hard O
experience O

Are O
you O
not O
working O
at O

I O
'm O
working O
on O

Go O
on O

No O
, O

I O
heard O
you O
. O

there O
is O
a O
terrible O
**thingy** O
a O
delay O
. O

%um O
, O
I O
'm O
working O
on O
my O
own O
, O
some O
private O
projects O
. O
Yes O
Right O
mhm O
. O
%um O
, O
which O
I O
enjoy O
, O

but O
it O
's O
not O
enou- O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
I O
have O
the O
mindset O
to O
be O
%um O
independent O
. O

I O
think O
I O
need O
to O
be O
an O
employee O
. O

mhm O
. O

I O
think O
it O
's O
more O
suitable O
to O
my O
personality O
and O
to O

it O
's O
my O
personality O
professionally O
as O
well O
as O
financially O
. O

mhm O
. O

I O
just O
think O
the O
way O
we O
manage O
money O
, O
it O
's O
just O
better O
. O

You O
like O
getting O
that O
paycheck O
once O
a O
week O
and O
not O
just O
waiting O
for O
the O
end O
of O
a O
project O
or O
something O
. O

It O
's O

Right O
. O

I O
enjoy O
the O
flexibility O
of O
working O
at O
home O
and O
working O
when O
I O
want O
, O
things O
like O
that O

but O
I O
do O
n't O
enjoy O
the O
pressure O
of O
it O
. O

Like O
you O
can O

It O
's O
always O
hanging O
over O
your O
head O
. O

Right O
. O

With O
i- O

and O
I O
have O
no O
problem O
you O
know O
, O
ignoring O
the O
laundry O
-- O
Right O
. O
-- O
and O
ignoring O
the O
kids O
and O
working O
, O

I O
just O
do O
n't O
like O
, O

it O
's O
just O
not O
suitable O
to O
me O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
I O
do O
it O
. O

I O
did O
it O
for O
a O
while O

and O
I O
hated O
it O
also O
. O

That O
was O
one O
of O
my O
kids O
, O
I O
think O
. O
I O
absolutely O
hated O
it O
because O
like O
I O
would O
be O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
like O
changing O
a O
kid O
's O
diaper O
and O
the O
phone O
would O
ring O
and O
it O
would O
you O
know O
be O
a O
business O
thing O
and O

Could O
be O
a O
client O
, O

yeah O
. O

Right O

right O

and O
like O
you O
have O
to O
try O
to O
act O
mature O
, O

your O
kids O
are O
screaming O
in O
the O
other O
room O

and O
you O
like O
have O
to O
pretend O
that O
nothing O
's O
go- O
you O
know O

and O
you O
really O
want O
to O
be O
in O
the O
other O
room O
, O
settling O
what O
's O
going O
on O

but O
you O
have O
to O
drop O
everything O
whenever O
, O

you O
never O
know O
. O

It O
's O
like O
there O
is O
a O
bomb O
waiting O
to O
go O
off O
always O
. O

But O
you O
can O
never O
relax O
. O

Right O

and O
I O
'd O
rather O
not O
be O
in O
the O
other O
room O
. O

I O
'd O
rather O
just O
be O
on O
the O
phone O
with O
the O
client O
. O

Right O
. O

But O
you O
know O
you O
also O
can O
never O
relax O
, O
because O
as O
soon O
as O
you O
sit O
down O
to O
read O
a O
book O
or O
do O
anything O
you O
're O
thinking O
, O
well O
, O
I O
really O
should O
be O
doing O
this O
or O
you O
know O
whatever O
. O

Well O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
that O
problem O
, O
because O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
steady O
flow O
of O
work O
, O
either O
. O

mhm O
. O

It O
comes O

and O
it O
goes O

and O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
that O
many O
things O

and O
I O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
people O
to O
refer O
them O

and O
I O
have O
to O
go O
get O
them O

and O
as O
many O
times O
as O
I O
go O
over O
every O
decision O
that O
I O
made O
along O
the O
way O
even O
over O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
three I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
and O
every O
decision O
was O
the O
right O
decision O
at O
the O
right O
time O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
it O
was O
n't O
anything O
I O
did O
, O
you O
know O

I O
mean O
, O
we O
had O
this O
great O
master O
plan O
%mm O
a O
few O
years O
ago O
that O
when O
I O
was O
working O
at O
the O
consulting O
company O
and O
doing O
freelance O
projects O
at O
night O
mhm O
. O
and O
going O
a O
little O
crazy O
because O
with O
three B-CARDINAL
kids O
at O
home O
and O
commuting O
%uh O
three B-TIME
hours I-TIME
a O
day O
really O
it O
was O
hard O
, O

but O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
give O
it O
up O
because O
it O
was O
n't O
so O
much O
the O
money O
it O
was O
I O
was O
trying O
to O
see O
if O
this O
was O
something O
I O
could O
really O
do O
. O
mhm O
. O
mhm O
. O
If O
I O
liked O
it O
and O
if O
I O
was O
good O
at O
it O
. O

Right O
. O

and O
when O
we O
wanted O
to O
have O
another O
baby O
mhm O
and O
we O
figured O

oh O
you O
know O
and O
Phil B-PERSON
wanted O
to O
work O
more O
. O

He O
wanted O
to O
invest O
more O
in O
his O
career O

Right O
. O

So O
, O
we O
figured O
our O
plan O
, O

all O
the O
best O
laid O
plans O
, O
right O
? O

mhm O

and O
the O
truth O
is O
our O
plans O
came O
better O
than O
they O
could O
've O
. O

%mm O
%mm O

They O
would O
have O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
have O
another O
baby O

and O
then O
I O
would O
have O
%um O
what O
's O
it O
called O
, O
a O
maternity O
leave O
, O

that O
I O
would O
take O
an O
extended O
one O
because O
I O
had O
been O
at O
this O
job O
for O
a O
while O
. O

Right O
. O

and O
that O
's O
when O
I O
would O
try O
to O
freelance O
a O
little O
bit O
and O
see O
and O
feel O
my O
oats O
in O
this O

but O
I O
would O
have O
a O
job O
waiting O
for O
me O
if O
I O
did O
n't O
like O
it O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
you O
gave O
me O
an O
address O
, O
though O
. O

I O
might O
not O
have O
had O
one O
then O
. O

Right O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
get O
it O
right O
at O
first O
. O

So O

So O
, O
when O
did O
you O
get O
there O
? O

I O
started O
work O
August B-DATE
first I-DATE

so O
what O
's O
today O
, O

the O
twentieth B-DATE
or O
something O
? O

uh-huh O
. O

The O
twentieth B-DATE

yeah O
. O

yeah O

%um O
and O
I O
arrived O
in O
Detroit B-GPE
just O
the O
night O
before O
I O
started O
work O

so O
I O
had O
been O
here O
just O
three B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
. O

It O
will O
be O
three B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
Tuesday B-DATE
That O
I O
started O
work O

and O
%um O
so O
I O
worked O
in O
the O
office O
for O
a B-DATE
week I-DATE
in I-DATE
a I-DATE
half I-DATE

and O
then O
we O
had O
our O
orientation O
for O
the O
new O

uh-huh O
. O

And O
that O
was O
out O
in O
western B-LOC
Michigan I-LOC
on O
Lake B-LOC
Michigan I-LOC
about B-TIME
four I-TIME
hours I-TIME
from O

and O
spent O
almost B-DATE
a I-DATE

I O
did O
n't O
want O

I O
broke O

so O

mhm O

And O
I O
have O
n't O
been O
to O
Texas B-GPE

I O
thought O

I O
think O
well O

for O
that O

%mm O
. O

mhm O

And O
then O
I O
'll O

them O

so O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
about O
Thanksgiving B-EVENT
yet O
. O

That O
's O
too O
far O
away O
to O
figure O
out O

so O

I O
will O
be O
. O

Gosh O
, O
are O
you O
happy O
? O

yeah O
, O

I O
am O

it O
was O
really O
hard O

one O
point O
decided O
no O
I O
'm O
not O
going O
to O

like O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
I O
want O

and O
-- O
mhm O
. O
I O
'm O
liking O
being O
in O
Omaha B-GPE
and O
all O
that O
sort O
of O
thing O

and O
so O
I O
called O
and O
told O
the O
director O
you O
know O
I O
thought O
about O
it O
a O
lot O
blah O
blah O
blah O

but O
I O
%eh O
just O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
right O
for O
me O
right O
now O

and O
mhm O
He O
was O
like O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
him O
very O
well O

but O
%uh O
he O
had O
strep O
throat O
when O
I O
was O
here O

I O

he O
just O
was O
n't O

really O
hard O
on O

? O

%eh O

She O
's O
like O

just O
want O
you O

more O
thing O

and O
%eh O
the O
job O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
a O
two O
year O
commitment O

uh-huh O
. O

and O
that O
was O
kind O
of O
like O
one O
of O
the O
things O
that O
I O
'm O
thinking O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
about O
doing O
a O
two B-DATE
year I-DATE
commitment O
%eh O
you O
know O
all O

or O
it O
was O
too O
short O
. O

well O
-- O
no O
, O

I O
mean O
it O
could O
be O
longer O

so O
it O
's O
not O
like O
it O
was O
too O
short O
. O

It O
was O
just O
. O
you O
know O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
I O
was O
thinking O

but O
anyway O
so O
they O
're O
like O
what O
if O
it O
was O
just O
a O
one B-DATE
year I-DATE
commitment O

and O
I O
said O
well O
I O
'll O
think O
about O
it O

kind O
of O
threw O
me O
off O

then O
I O
called O

I O
asked O
the O
director O

%um O

I O
said O

and O
a O
second B-ORDINAL
year O
area O
director O
makes O

thousand I-CARDINAL
five I-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
. O

First B-ORDINAL
year O
you O
get O
three B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
vacation O
. O

Second B-ORDINAL
year O
you O
get O
four B-DATE
weeks I-DATE

and O
I O
said O
well O
would O
you O
be O
willing O
to O
hire O
me O
as O
if O
I O
was O
coming O
in O
at O
a O
second B-ORDINAL
year O
mhm O
. O
%um O
%eh O
at O
eighteen B-CARDINAL
five B-CARDINAL
with O
four B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
of O
vacation O

and O
he O
said O
yeah O
he O
would O
be O
willing O
to O
do O
that O
. O

Wow O
that O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
vacation O
. O

yeah O

it O
is O
which O
is O
wonderful O

That O
's O
great O
. O

%mm O
. O
And O
that O
's O
more O
important O
to O
me O
than O
money O

so O

Right O

yeah O

and O
we O
get O
the O
whole O
week O
from O
Christmas B-EVENT
to O
New B-EVENT
Year I-EVENT

that O
's O
one O
of O
our O
weeks O
of O
vacation O

so O
it O
's O
only O
mhm O
. O
you O
know O
in O
addition O
to O
that O

So O
anyway O
, O

And O
the O
rest O
you O
can O
take O
pretty O
much O
%eh O
when O
you O
want O

I O
mean O
you O
work O
it O
around O
your O
schedule O
. O

Right O
. O

yeah O
, O

you O
got O
to O
work O
it O
around O
your O
schedule O
which O
is O

in O
you O
know O
summer O
is O
not O
a O
really O
good O
time O
to O
take O
it O
because O
you O
're O
ending O
one B-DATE
year I-DATE
and O
starting O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
year I-DATE
and O
you O
know O
doing O
a O
lot O
with O
the O
volunteers O
coming O
in O

mhm O
. O

-- O
so O
I O
'll O
probably O
try O
to O
take O
most O
of O
it O
before O
next O
summer O
, O

we O
'll O
see O
. O

mhm O
. O

%um O
so O
I O
thought O
about O
it O
that O
day O

and O
I O
ended O
up O
calling O
back O
and O
saying O
okay O
I O
'm O
coming O
to O
Detroit B-GPE

so O
It O
's O
been O
really O
good O
since O
I O
've O

I O
mean O
actually O
I O
made O
the O
decision O

and O
I O
thought O
oh O
God O
what O
am O
I O
doing O
you O
know O

I O
just O
was O
still O
unsure O
about O
it O

but O
in O
a O
couple O
days O
I O
just O
felt O
really O
at O
peace O
with O
it O
and O
remained O
so O
throughout O
the O
time O
that O
I O
prepared O
to O
leave O

and O
then O
ever O
since O
I O
've O
been O
here O
I O
keep O
thinking O
okay O
why O
am O
I O
so O
okay O
with O
this O

I O
'm O
going O
to O
be O
falling O
apart O
any O
minute O
, O
right O
you O
know O
? O

Because O
I O
'm O
really O
used O
to O
transition O
hitting O
me O
a O
little O
bit O
harder O
especially O
when O
I O
was O
so O
ambivalent O
about O
the O
decision O

but O
Right O
. O
%um O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

It O
's O
been O
great O

That O
's O
great O
. O

So O

yeah O
. O

Great O
. O

Do O
n't O
question O
it O
? O

Go O
with O
it O

yeah O

exac- O

that O
's O
what O
I O
said O
finally O
%um O

I O
was O
telling O
somebody O

somebody O
is O
like O
well O
how O
you O
doing O
? O

I O
said O
well O
I O
'm O
fine O
you O
know O

I O
keep O
wondering O
how O
long O
that O
's O
going O
to O
last O
. O

I O
'm O
fine O

what O
's O
wrong O
with O
me O

and O
then O
finally O
I O
'm O
like O
you O
know O
I O
am O
just O
going O
to O
be O
okay O
that O
I O
'm O
okay O

and O
if O
I O
'm O
not O
okay O
later O
that O
's O
fine O

but O
right O
now O
I O
'm O
okay O

I O
have O
to O
stop O
wondering O
when O
it O
's O
going O
to O
end O

So O
that O
's O
kind O
of O
where O
I O
've O
been O
. O

%hm O
%hm O
So O
tell O
me O
about O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE

got O
your O
postcard O

%um O
I O
loved O
the O
city O
. O

It O
was O

yeah O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O

I O
did O
n't O
expect O
to O
enjoy O
the O
city O
so O
much O
. O

You O
had O
been O
there O
before O
though O
had O
n't O
you O

no O
? O

Just O
really O
briefly O
. O

I O
went O
to O
Long O
Island O
for O
a O
friend O
's O
wedding O

and O
Katie B-PERSON
and O
I O
, O
my O
housemate O
from O
Oregon B-GPE
went O
together O

uh-huh O
. O

and O
we O
took O
a O
train O
into O
the O
city O
, O
a O
cab O
to O
the B-ORG
Metropolitan I-ORG
Museum I-ORG
&of I-ORG
Art I-ORG
ran O
around O
there O
for O
an O
hour O
and O
half O
, O
took O
a O
cab O
back O
, O
and O
then O
the O
train O
back O
to O
Long B-GPE
Island I-GPE

so O
I O
mean O
that O
was O
it O
. O

That O
's O
all O
we O
saw O
. O

oh O
that O
was O
it O
. O

%um O
and O
I O
liked O
that O

but O
it O
did O
n't O
even O
feel O
like O
I O
had O
actually O
been O
in O
the O
city O
you O
know O
. O

mhm O
. O

%um O
so O
this O
was O
more O
like O

you O
know O
we O
did O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
**touristy** O
stuff O
and O
walked O
on O
the B-FAC
Brooklyn I-FAC
Bridge I-FAC
and O
mhm O
. O
took O
the O
ferry O
and O
%um O
walked O
in O
Central B-LOC
Park I-LOC
and O
went O
to O
a O
show O
and O
all O
that O
sort O
of O
stuff O

so O
it O
was O
really O
fun O
%um O

Sounds O
great O

and O
we O
also O
went O
out O
to O
Long B-GPE
Island I-GPE
where O
Joe B-PERSON
's O
mom O
lives O
-- O
uh-huh O
. O
and O
spent O
time O
with O
the O
whole O
family O
So O
-- O
which O
was O
okay O
. O

It O
was O
good O
. O

. O
At O
first O
when O
we O
were O
planning O
the O
trip O
he O
's O
like O
oh O
I O
hope O
we O
can O
go O
out O
and O
you O
know O
go O
to O
the O
beach O
and O
you O
can O
meet O
my O
brother O
and O
my O
nieces O
and O
nephe- O

he O
's O
got O
three B-CARDINAL
brothers O

%um O
two B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
live O
on O
Long B-GPE
Island I-GPE
. O

You O
want O
to O
meet O
my O
brothers O
and O
my O
nieces O
and O
nephews O

and O
I O
'm O
like O
%um O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
Joe B-PERSON

I O
do O
n't O

I O
said O
I O
think O
maybe O
we O
need O
the O
time O
just O
to O
kind O
of O
figure O
out O
where O
our O
relationship O
is O
before O

mhm O
. O

I O
said O
it O
's O
not O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
meet O
your O
family O

it O
's O
just O

I O
do O
n't O
know O

-- O
That O
's O
a O
lot O
at O
once O
. O
I O
know O
his O
mom O
too O

and O
I O
think O
she O
's O
a O
little O
bit O
leery O
of O
this O
whole O
relationship O
based O
on O
what O
happened O
in O
the O
past O
you O
know O

mhm O
. O

and O
I O
hurt O
her O
son O
and O
all O
that O
sort O
of O
thing O
. O

I O
'm O
like O
I O
just O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
I O
'm O
ready O
for O
that O

but O
it O
ended O
up O
happening O
that O
it O
was O
his O
brother O
's O
birthday O

and O
we O
were O
out O
there O
to O
go O
to O
the O
beach O

and O
so O
I O
'm O
like O
okay O
you O
know O
I O
can O
handle O
this O

and O
%uh O
it O
was O
very O
nice O
actually O

so O
Good O
. O
that O
was O
fine O

and O
%uh O

So O
where O
did O
things O
end O
up O
? O

oh O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
Vick B-PERSON
, O

%um O
it O
was O
really O
fun O

and O
I O
mean O
in O
some O
ways O
Joe B-PERSON
is O
somebody O
I O
've O
known O
a O
long O
time O
and O
and O
know O
pretty O
well O

but O
in O
other O
ways O
it O
's O
like O
this O
is O
a O
whole O
new O
relationship O

mhm O
. O

so O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
weird O
to O
walk O
that O
balance O
like O
well O
you O
know O
, O
one B-TIME
minute I-TIME
we O
're O
talking O
seriously O
like O
where O
would O
we O
live O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
be O
together O
and O
the O
next O
you O
know O
I O
'm O
like O
Wow O
. O
wait O
a O
minute O

I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
we O
're O
talking O
about O
this O

I O
mean O

What O
's O
he O
doing O
now O
? O

He O
's O
in O
his O
last O
year O
of O
graduate O
school O
at O
Columbia O
University O
. O

He O
's O
getting O
his O
Masters O
in O
Public O
Administration O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

And O
he O
's O
been O
working O
with O
this O
man O
who O
's O
starting O
a O
new O
nonprofit O
organization O

%um O

he O
worked O
with O
him O
last O
summer O
and O
this O
summer O
and O
probably O
will O
work O
with O
during O
the O
school O
year O
. O

Beyond O
that O
he O
does O
n't O
know O
what O
he O
's O
going O
to O
do O
you O
know O

but O
you O
know O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
hard O
because O
-- O
Kind O
of O
open O
but O
I O
mean O
chances O
are O
really O
good O
that O
he O
'll O
want O
to O
stay O
in O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
or O
at O
least O
on O
the O
east O
coast O
, O
you O
know O
? O

Right O
. O

Kind O
of O
interested O
in O
politics O

so O
D B-GPE
C I-GPE
would O
be O
an O
option O

and O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

It O
's O
just O
hard O
because O
that O
's O
not O
really O
yeah O
where O
I O
'm O
at O

but O
I O
mean O
we O
're O
both O
sort O
of O
like O
we O
do O
n't O
know O
where O
life O
is O
taking O
us O

and O

Hard O
to O
start O
a O
relationship O
when O
that O

yeah O
, O

so O
what O
do O
we O
do O

you O
know O
do O
we O
make O
decisions O
based O
on O
each O
other O

I O
mean O
this O
was O
just O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
weekend O
we O
've O
seen O
each O
other O

so O
he O
's O
coming O
here O
over O
Labor B-EVENT
Day I-EVENT
weekend O
-- O

mhm O
. O

and O
then O
because O
my O
schedule O
gets O
so O
crazy O
starting O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
October O
I O
am O
going O
to O
go O
there O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
weekend I-DATE
of I-DATE
October I-DATE
. O

That O
was O
kind O
of O
hard O
for O
us O
to O
decide O

you O
know O
he O
has O
n't O
even O
been O
here O
yet O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
seen O
him O
since O
the O
Fourth B-DATE
of I-DATE
July I-DATE
weekend O

and O
we O
decided O
well O
you O
know O
let O
's O
go O
ahead O

uh-huh O
. O

You O
know O

so O
Sure O
. O
I O
get O
that O
plus O
%uh O
you O
know O
the O
one B-CARDINAL
day O
a O
week O
. O

Plus O
. O

And O
I O
live O
modestly O
you O
know O
. O

how O
well O
I O
know O
that O
. O

yeah O
. O

You O
know O
this O
is O
my O
theory O
too O
to O
live O
modestly O
. O

mhm O
. O

Like O
wearing O
one O
dress O
. O

I O
still O
have O
a O

n't O
admit O

would O
n't O
admit O
. O

's O
right O

with O
all O

work O
. O

had O
a O
play O
about O
their O

they O
want O

time O

so O
I O
've O
got O
that O
. O

mhm O
. O

You O
know O
I O
've O
got O
it O
sitting O
here O

so O
I O
ca O
n't O
ignore O
it O

but O
I O
really O

Sure O
. O

You O
know O
that O
's O
not O
my O
expertise O

shape O
or O
form O

But O
yeah O
yeah O
. O
They O
're O
making O
it O

right O
. O

So O

. O

Sure O

sure O

And O
%uh O
I O

%um O

last O

. O

oh O
. O

%uh O
they O
have O
a O

is O
a O

that O
car- O

and O
he O
's O
the O
purchaser O
for O

three B-CARDINAL
or O
four B-DATE

but O
they O
you O
know O
occasionally O

. O

And O
so O
they O
spent O
three B-CARDINAL
or O
four B-DATE
days I-DATE
in O
Ann B-GPE
Arbor I-GPE

and O

oh O
he O
lives O

Ann B-GPE
Arbor I-GPE

different O
uh-huh O
. O

yeah O

i- O

yeah O

I O
think O
it O
's O
the O
granddaughter O
. O

The O
granddaughter O
uh-huh O

yeah O

she O

and O
what O
does O
her O
husband O
do O

do O
you O
know O
? O

Elsa B-PERSON
's O
? O

Yes O
. O

No O

%uh O
the O
couple O
of O
times O
that O
I O
%uh O
went O
to O
Tucson B-GPE
%uh O
she O
would O
come O
you O
know O
when O
they O
would O
invite O
relatives O
in O
like O
their O
kids O
that O
live O
there O

Yes O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

and O
they O
'd O
always O
invite O
Elsa B-PERSON

one O
year O
in O
fact O
when O
I O
was O
there O
Lida B-PERSON
and O
Irv B-PERSON
were O

they O
spend O
a O
month O
in O
Tucson B-GPE
every O
year O
. O

mhm O
. O

I O
think O
it O
's O
February B-DATE
you O
know O
the O
worst O
of O
the O
winter O
. O

Sure O
. O

oh O
the O
worst O
of O
the O
winter O
right O
. O

yeah O

and O
%um O
I O
know O
I O
've O
met O
her O
each O
time O
. O

He O
must O
be O
some O
sort O
of O
a O
salesman O
because O
both O
times O
I O
think O
he O
was O
in O
Texas B-GPE
which O
is O
n't O
far O
you O
know O
mhm O
. O
mhm O
mhm O
. O
when O
you O
're O
in O
that O
part O
of O
the O
world O
. O

Sure O

right O

I O
know O
it O
's O
close O
. O

%um O
but O
always O
on O
business O

and O
I O
remember O
they O
told O
me O
that O
he O
's O
gone O
a O
lot O
so O
you O
know O
he O
's O
in O
and O
out O
but O
that O
she O
manages O
very O
well O
. O

mhm O
. O

mhm O
. O
mhm O

They O
all O
felt O
she O
was O
just O
a O
great O
mother O
you O
know O
the O
way O
she O
took O
care O
of O
her O
kids O
. O

That O
's O
wonderful O

%uh O
you O
know O
%uh O
I O
think O
you O
learn O
a O
lot O
when O
you O
have O
such O
a O
big O
family O

you O
learn O
how O
to O
juggle O
it O
around O
you O
know O
. O

really O
. O

really O
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
apparently O
she O

%uh O
%eh O
my O
impression O
is O
they O
're O
not O
wealthy O
you O
know O

in O
fact O
I O
got O
the O
impression O
they O
were O
struggling O
just O
a O
little O
bit O
%uh O
that O
's O
Elsa B-PERSON
and O
her O
husband O
when O
the O
babies O
were O
little O

Well O
you O
know O
the O
big O
family O
like O
that O
right O
. O

yeah O

and O
she O
could O
n't O
have O
been O
working O
very O
much O
at O
that O
point O
if O
at O
all O
. O

Either O

right O
right O
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
so O
probably O
one O
%uh O
income O
just O
you O
know O
was O
making O
it O

%eh O
makes O
it O
hard O
of O
course O
. O

yeah O

you O
know O
. O

Now O
is O
n't O
there O
another O
daughter O

or O
do O
n't O

is O
it O
another O
daughter O
or O
another O
son O
? O

oh O

uh-huh O
. O

And O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
either O

What O
's O
there O

uh-huh O
. O

I O
've O
only O
met O
those O
two B-CARDINAL

but O
you O
're O
right O

there O
's O
one B-CARDINAL
other O
chil- O

I O
think O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
another O
child O
. O

%uh O
I O
'm O
positive O
you O
're O
right O

%eh O
it O
just O
registered O
. O

Right O
. O

it O
seems O
to O
me O
they O
may O
even O
have O
said O
something O
about O
him O

but O
I O
never O
met O
the O
third B-ORDINAL
one O

so O
you O
know O
mhm O
. O
mhm O
. O
it O
did O
n't O
stick O
with O
me O
whatever O
they O
said O
. O

That O
was O
nice O
to O
see O
family O
you O
know O
%uh O
over O
the O
years O

it O
's O
very O
interesting O
. O

mhm O
. O

Is O
n't O
it O
? O

mhm O
. O

Do O
you O
ever O
see O
Abe B-PERSON
? O

He O
also O
lives O
in O
Ann B-GPE
Arbor I-GPE
. O

He O
's O
very O
sick O
. O

oh O
. O

He O
had O
major O
surgery O
four B-CARDINAL
or O
five B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE

and O
he O
walked O
around O
That O
I O
remember O
. O
yeah O
. O
yeah O
like O
a O
walking O
skeleton O
. O

mhm O
. O

And O
the O
only O
time O
I O
see O
him O
now O
is O
if O
I O
call O
and O
ask O
them O
to O
come O

mhm O
. O

and O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
now O
that O
you O
mention O
it O

it O
's O
been O
about O
a O
year O
. O

mhm O
. O

Before O
you O
know O
when O
he O
was O
still O
quite O
well O
he O
would O
occasionally O
drop O
in O
mhm O
. O
because O
their O
daughter O
lives O
mhm O
. O
I O
think O
actually O
on O
the O
eastern O
part O
of O
the O
city O
. O

mhm O
. O

y- O

Not O
in O
Detroit B-GPE
but O
you O
know O

it O
's O
not O
Warren B-GPE

Sterling B-GPE
Heights I-GPE

I O
do O
n't O
know O

something O
like O
that O
. O

yeah O
. O

yeah O

yeah O
. O

yeah O

yeah O

oh O

So O
if O
he O
was O
going O
to O
visit O
her O
he O
would O
you O
know O
occasionally O
stop O
in O
here O
on O
his O
way O
home O
. O

Sure O
. O

Sure O
. O

But O
since O
he O
's O
been O
ill O
he O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
do O
that O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
sure O
that O

their O
daughter O
is O
Linda B-PERSON

Yes O

yes O
. O

and O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
whether O
she O
got O
married O
or O
she O
's O
just O
been O
living O
with O
this O
man O
for O
a O
long O
while O

but O
they O
tell O
me O
he O
works O
at O
Chrysler B-ORG

and O
he O
makes O
nice O
money O

and O
they O
seem O
to O
have O
a O
very O
nice O
home O
mhm O
. O
mhm O
. O
you O
know O
. O

Well O
that O
's O
good O
. O

yeah O

yeah O

You O
know O
considering O
everything O
I O
say O
that O
's O
good O
. O

mhm O
. O

a- O

So O
we O
took O
care O
of O
them O
. O

yeah O
. O

Now O
%uh O
we O
did O
n't O
take O
care O
of O
your O
children O
yet O
. O

Well O
%uh O
I O
still O
have O
two B-CARDINAL
in O
San B-GPE
Jose I-GPE
. O

And O
you O
know O
I O
'm O
so O
angry O
at O
you O

you O
send O
me O
a O
card O

uh-huh O
. O

you O
never O
send O
me O
an O
address O
or O
a O
telephone O
number O

and O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
where O
to O
respond O
. O

%ah O
. O

And O
I O
'm O
left O
stymied O

and O
I O
read O
it O
and O
read O
it O

and O
I O
say O
why O
did O
n't O
she O
give O
me O
a O
telephone O
number O

I O
'd O
call O
her O
back O
. O

yeah O

I O
never O
even O
think O
of O
it O
. O

You O
will O
next O
time O
. O

yeah O

now O
that O
you O
said O
it O
I O
sure O
will O
. O

Sure O
it O
's O
the O

%uh O
get O
me O
a O
telephone O
number O
on O
that O
card O
so O
I O
can O
call O
you O

All O

. O

You O
go O
there O
. O

You O
go O
there O
f- O
%uh O

do O
n't O
you O
start O
a O

Well O
I O
have O
n't O
been O
the- O

once O
a O
year O
. O

A O
lot O
of O
people O
who O
come O
from O
two B-CARDINAL
different O
religions O
go O
there O
. O

oh O
yeah O
. O

yeah O
, O

. O

yeah O
. O

mhm O
%hm O
. O

So O
it O
was O
wonderful O

and O
%um O

And O
then O
what O
was O
the O
, O
%um O
, O
reception O
like O
? O

Well O
we O
went O
out O
into O
the O
garden O
and O
sort O
of O
had O
an O
informal O
receiving O
line O
, O

and O
then O
everybody O
went O
up O
to O
North B-LOC
Park I-LOC
and O
changed O
clothes O
, O

and O
uh-huh O
. O
we O
played O
softball O
, O
and O
, O
%uh O

four O
square O
, O
and O
had O
dancing O
and O
music O
and O
great O
food O
, O
and O

Wow O
, O
that O
sounds O
like O
a O
lot O
of O
fun O
. O

It O
was O
. O

Wow O
. O

It O
sounds O
like O
it O
was O
great O

yeah O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
told O
us O
it O
was O
the O
best O
wedding O
they O
had O
ever O
been O
to O
, O

and O
that O
's O
, O
I O
guess O
, O
the O
highest O
compliment O
you O
can O
get O
. O

Wow O
. O

So O
, O

and O
where O
, O
did O
you O
guys O
go O
on O
a O
honeymoon O
? O

We O
went O
on O
a O
honeymoon O
to O
this O
island O
off O
the O
coast O
of O
Puerto B-GPE
Rico I-GPE
. O
oh O
god O
. O
In O
the B-LOC
Carribean I-LOC
. O

But O
the O
hardest O
part O
was O
getting O
there O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
we O
had O
to O
take O
three B-CARDINAL
planes O
to O
get O
there O
. O

But O
the O

We O
got O
this O
book O
from O
my O
mom O
about O
the B-LOC
Carribean I-LOC
. O

And O
, O
%um O
. O
I O
'd O
always O
wanted O
to O
go O
to O
the B-LOC
Carribean I-LOC
. O

So O
we O
just O
decided O
okay O
, O
we O
'll O
go O
. O

We O
only O
went O
for O
five B-DATE
days I-DATE
. O

It O
was O
pretty O
short O

but O
, O
%um O
. O
uh-huh O
. O
The O
place O
was O
totally O
laid O
back O
. O

It O
was O
this O
old O
plantation O
house O
that O
, O
%um O
, O
had O
this O
twenty B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
four I-CARDINAL
rooms O
. O

and O
, O
they O
said O
in O
the O
book O
like O
you O
wo O
n't O
be O
able O
to O
tell O
the O
guests O
from O
the O
staff O
. O

And O
mhm O
. O
%um O
, O
it O
was O
really O
, O
really O
cool O
. O

And O
they O
have O
, O
you O
know O
, O
mismatched O
sheets O
and O
stuff O
. O

It O
was O
n't O
fancy O
at O
all O
, O

but O
it O
was O
really O
cheap O
. O

And O
uh-huh O
They O
just O
had O
the O
bar O
open O
all O
the O
time O
. O

You O
could O
go O
and O
get O
whatever O
you O
wanted O
and O
just O
write O
it O
on O
your O
guest O
ticket O
. O

And O
oh O
my O
god O
. O
They O
picked O
fresh O
mangoes O
from O
the O
yard O
for O
breakfast O
, O
and O
stuff O
. O

It O
was O
great O
. O

Wow O
, O
it O
sounds O
idyllic O
. O

It O
was O
really O
tiny O
, O

so O
, O

the O
island O
is O
only O
ten B-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
long O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

%um O
. O
But O
it O
was O
good O
cause O
you O
know O
, O
everybody O
speaks O
English B-LANGUAGE
, O

and O
yet O
it O
's O
still O
pretty O
exotic O
, O
you O
know O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

We O
went O
snorkeling O
. O

And O
, O
it O
wa- O

God O
, O
it O
sounds O
great O
. O

That O
's O
something O
I O
really O
regret O
is O
that O
Norm B-PERSON
and O
I O
did O
n't O
have O
a O
honeymoon O
. O

yeah O
, O

well O
you O
should O

anyway O

we O
were O
planning O
on O
going O
on O
one O
one O
of O
these O
days O
, O

but O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
now O
what O
's O
going O
to O
happen O
. O

Well O
, O
you O
'll O
just O
have O
to O
take O
your O
kid O
. O

I O
know O

I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
really O
funny O
if O
we O
go O
right O
now O
and O
tell O
people O
we O
're O
going O
on O
our O
honeymoon O
. O

How O
big O
are O
you O
? O

%um O
, O
well O
actually O
I O
've O
only O
gained O
four B-QUANTITY
pounds I-QUANTITY
. O
uh-huh O
. O
But O
is O
it O
showing O
? O
Which O
is O
not O
a O
lot O
you O
know O
, O
for O
how O
far O
I O
am O
, O

but O
I O
'm O
definitely O
pregnant O
. O

yeah O

I O
mean O
I O
have O
all O
of O
the O
. O

You O
know O
I O
need O
to O
give O
myself O
the O
extra O
support O
when O
I O
get O
up O
. O

And O
uh-huh O
. O
like O
, O
you O
know O
like O
how O
wide O
you O
put O
your O
feet O
apart O
when O
you O
get O
up O
? O

uh-huh O
. O

Well O
I O
have O
to O
probably O
put O
my O
feet O
like O
five B-QUANTITY
inches I-QUANTITY
further O
apart O
and O
kind O
of O
hoist O
myself O
up O
sort O
of O
like O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

So O
. O

Which O
is O
pretty O
funny O

yeah O
, O

I O
'm O
definitely O
pregnant O
. O

But O
I O
'm O
not O
huge O
by O
any O
means O
. O

But O
what O
are O
you O
five B-DATE
and I-DATE
a I-DATE
half I-DATE
months I-DATE
now O
? O

yeah O
. O

So O
, O
it O
's O
just O
starting O
to O
get O
into O
the O
part O
where O
you O
start O
to O
show O
. O
And O
uh-huh O
. O
start O
to O
get O
big O
and O
the O
whole O
bit O

%um O
, O
like O
I O
'm O
not O
fatter O
in O

Except O

stomach O
. O

I O
mean O
it O
honestly O
looks O
like O
I O
swallowed O

I O
mean O
it O
's O
really O
weird O
. O

Like O
You O
can O
s- O
. O

I O
've O
never O
really O
like O
been O
up O
close O
to O
a O
pregnant O
woman O
before O

but O
you O
know O
, O
like O
I O
've O
seen O
them O
at O
the O
gym O
and O
stuff O
like O
that O
, O
but O
never O
had O
a O
good O
friend O
that O
lived O
close O
by O
that O
was O
pregnant O
that O
I O
could O
like O
actually O
look O
at O
her O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

But O
you O
can O
see O
the O
line O
of O
your O
uterus O
. O

You O
can O
see O
in O
your O
stomach O
where O
it O
is O
. O

It O
's O
like O
this O
big O
circle O

and O
it O
sticks O
out O
in O
that O
big O
circle O
. O

And O
it O
's O
filling O
up O
with O
a O
-- O
yeah O
. O
-- O
thing O
. O
An O
alien O
presence O
. O

That O
's O
totally O
what O
it O
feels O
like O
. O

Really O
. O

Does O
it O
move O
around O
yet O
? O

oh O
yeah O
. O

he O
kicks O
a O
lot O
. O

I O
do O
n't O

just O
started O
this B-DATE
week I-DATE
. O

He O
started O
rolling O
that O
I O
can O
feel O
. O

I O
mean O
they O
roll O
the O
whole O
time O
, O

but O
now O
I O
can O
feel O
him O
rolling O
, O

and O
it O
's O
totally O
bizarre O
. O

It O
's O

Do O
you O
have O
a O
name O
for O
it O
, O
I O
mean O
like O
you O
know O
a O
joke O
name O

Like O

No O

Thumper B-PERSON
, O
cause O
he O
just O
kicks O
so O
much O
. O

He O
's O
really O
an O
active O
baby O
. O

Thumper B-PERSON
. O

Well O
that O
's O
good O
. O

yeah O
. O

Healthy O
. O

Well O
, O
also O
the O
monster O
child O
is O
the O
other O
thing O
I O
call O
him O
. O

The O
monster O
child O
. O

Rosemary B-PERSON
's O
baby O
. O

I O
know O
. O

Well O
, O
%um O
. O
Because O
he O
kicks O
so O
much O
, O
you O
know O
, O
it O
's O
really O
annoying O
. O

I O
mean O

Does O
it O
wake O
you O
up O
? O

No O
he O
has O
n't O
woken O
me O
up O
yet O
, O

but O
if O
I O
wake O
up O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night O
, O
he O
does O
kick O

and O
so O
you O
can O
feel O
him O
kicking O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night O
if O
you O
wake O
up O
. O

What O
if O
it O
's O
a O
girl O
? O

Well O
, O
it O
's O
probably O
not O
a O
girl O
, O
because O
in O
our O
family O
, O
if O
you O
go O
on O
both O
sides O
of O
our O
family O
, O
and O
you O
look O
at O
all O
our O
first B-ORDINAL
cousins O
, O
and O
everything O
, O
it O
's O
like O
seventy B-PERCENT
five I-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
male O
. O

%huh O
. O

But O
it O
might O
be O
a O
girl O
. O

I O
was O
positive O
it O
was O
a O
girl O
. O

Like O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
three I-DATE
months I-DATE
, O
I O
was O
absolutely O
positive O
it O
was O
a O
girl O
. O

And O
then O
I O
changed O
my O
mind O
an- O

now O
she O
is O
a O
boy O
. O

Well O
that O
'll O
be O
a O
surprise O
then O
. O

yeah O
, O

yeah O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

Are O
you O
going O
to O
ask O
them O
not O
to O
tell O
you O
if O
you O
had O

oh O
we O
're O
not O
having O
an O
ultrasound O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

Because O
it O
's O
really O
like O
, O

We O
went O
and O
looked O
up O
all O
this O
research O
. O

There O
's O
all O
this O
stuff O
. O

You O
'll O
see O
when O
you O
get O
pregnant O
. O

And O
, O
if O
you O
want O
to O
know O
, O
just O
send O
me O
email O
. O
Because O
I O
looked O
up O
a O
bunch O
of O
stuff O
, O

but O
, O
there O
's O
all O
different O
kinds O
of O
prenatal O
tests O
that O
you O
can O
get O
now O
. O

It O
's O
not O
just O
amnio O
, O

it O
's O
like O
other O
stuff O
too O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

And O
then O
there O
's O
also O
, O
%um O
, O
you O
know O
, O
%uh O
, O
the O
ultrasound O
. O

But O
in O
fact O
, O
like O
if O
you O
look O
at O
the O
latest O
research O
on O
ultrasound O
, O
it O
's O
like O
, O
they O
really O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

Like O
they O
assume O
that O
it O
's O
safe O
, O
because O
, O
you O
know O
, O
they O
've O
had O
it O
for O
twenty B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
right O
. O

And O
nothing O
has O
happened O
? O

They O
never O

Ye- O
, O

well O
they O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

They O
've O
never O
really O
done O
any O
big O
studies O
on O
it O
or O
anything O
. O

but O
if O
you O
're O
a O
normal O
, O
low O
, O

like O
there O
's O
reasons O
to O
have O
an O
ultrasound O
. O

And O
if O
you O
have O
to O
have O
an O
ultrasound O
, O
then O
it O
's O
a O
really O
good O
diagnostic O
tool O
, O
right O
? O

Right O
. O

But O
in O
a O
normal O
low O
risk O
pregnancy O
like O
mine O
it O
's O
not O
a O
good O
diagnostic O
tool O
at O
all O
. O

Like O
, O
they O
find O
as O
many O
, O
%um O
, O
false O
positives O
as O
they O
do O
false O
negatives O
. O

for O
spina O
bifida O
and O
stuff O
? O

Well O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
can O
really O
check O
, O
they O
can O
check O
the O
heart O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

And O
then O
they O
can O
check O
to O
see O
if O
the O
baby O
has O
a O
brain O
. O

yeah O
. O
But O
then O
they O
can O
do O
some O
measurements O
to O
see O
if O
the O
baby O
has O
, O
%um O
, O
%ah O

Defects O
of O
various O
kinds O
. O

Like O
Down B-PERSON
's O
Syndrome O
. O

Like O
sometimes O
y- O
. O

But O
that O
's O
not O
really O
very O
good O
. O

Like O
amnio O
is O
the O
only O
sure O
way O
to O
find O
out O
. O

Right O
. O

But O
it O
could O
give O
you O
like O
some O
indications O
that O
the O
baby O
might O
have O
Down B-PERSON
's O
or O
something O
. O

But O
it O
's O
really O
not O
a O
very O
good O
diagnostic O
tool O
at O
all O
for O
people O
with O
low O
risk O
pregnancies O
. O

So O
, O
yeah O
. O
I O
did O
n't O
bother O
getting O
one O
. O

yeah O
, O

good O
. O

I O
'm O
sure O
everything O
will O
be O
fine O
. O

oh O
yeah O
. O

And O
if O
it O
's O
not O
, O
it O
's O
like O
, O
you O
know O
, O
you O
're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
deal O
with O
it O
anyway O
. O

Well O
what O
are O
you O
going O
to O
do O
I O
mean O
, O
if O
it O
's O
not O
, O
like O

and O
we O
did O
n't O
do O
any O
of O
the O
testing O
because O
, O
like O
, O
I O
've O
met O
like O
three B-CARDINAL
people O
since O
I O
got O
pregnant O
, O
where O
the O
baby O
had O
Down B-PERSON
's O
, O
right O
. O

They O
found O
out O
the O
baby O
had O
Down B-PERSON
's O
. O

And O
they O
aborted O
it O
. O

They O
had O
, O

well O
, O
it O
's O
not O
called O
abortion O
, O
it O
's O
called O
termina- O

Termination O
, O

that O
's O
right O
. O

And O
I O
just O
could O
n't O
have O
done O
that O
. O

I O
just O
. O

We O
talked O
about O
it O
a O
little O
bit O
, O

you O
know O
what O
I O
mean O
. O

Like O
obviously O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
my O
baby O
to O
have O
a O
mental O
defect O
or O
anything O
like O
that O
. O

But O

But O
if O
it O
does O
, O
you O
'll O
deal O
with O
it O
. O

I O
just O
could O
not O
have O
done O
that O
. O

So O
it O
was O
n't O
worth O
doing O
the O
prenatal O
testing O
. O
Because O
, O
you O
know O

If O
you O
're O
not O
going O
to O
abort O
anyway O
, O
then O
there O
's O
no O
reason O
to O
have O
it O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
mean O
there O
are O
some O
conditions O
that O
they O
can O
test O
for O
that O
are O
sort O
of O
incompatible O
with O
life O
. O

Right O
. O

But O
then O
I O
figured O
, O
well O
, O
I O
'll O
just O
go O
through O
the B-DATE
nine I-DATE
months I-DATE
of O
pregnancy O
and O
then O
the O
baby O
will O
die O
when O
it O
's O
born O
. O
You O
know O
. O

If O
it O
's O
like O
that O
. O

yeah O
. O

yeah O
, O

we O
had O
this O
friend O
. O

This O
is O
not O
supposed O
to O
scare O
you O
, O

it O
's O
just O
because O
it O
was O
on O
the O
topic O
. O

%um O
, O
but O
, O
the O
baby O
died O
at O
like B-DATE
eight I-DATE
and I-DATE
a I-DATE
half I-DATE
months I-DATE
. O

%mm O
. O

I O
know O
. O

I O
read O
so O
many O
of O
those O
stories O
. O

They O
just O
freak O
me O
out O
. O

You O
know O
. O

And O
of O
course O
they O
make O
you O
give O
birth O
anyway O
. O

You O
know O
you O
ca O
n't O
have O
an O

You O
have O
to O
. O

I O
mean O
what O
are O
. O

I O
mean O
that O
's O
how O
you O
have O
an O
abortion O
is O
you O
give O
birth O
you O
kn- O

yeah O
. O

And O
it O
's O
dead O

you O
know O
it O
's O
dead O
. O

And O
it O
's O
a O
hassle O
, O
you O
know O
. O

And O
you O
've O
got O
to O
go O
through O
all O
that O
pain O
knowing O
the O
baby O
's O
not O
even O
alive O
anyway O
. O

yeah O
. O

But O
, O
you O
know O
. O
She O
's O
pregnant O
again O
. O

You O
know O
, O
they O
're O
fine O
. O

And O
what O
happened O
to O
the O
baby O
? O

Do O
they O
know O
? O

They O
got O
over O
it O
. O

I O
think O
it O
got O
either O
strangled O
by O
its O
cord O
or O
some O
kind O
of O

yeah O

that O
's O
what O
they O
g- O
. O

They O
always O
say O
that O
g- O

They O
say O
that O

but O

cord O
accident O
. O

it O
was O
an O
accident O
. O

It O
's O
like O
they O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

yeah O
, O

you O
know O
. O
It O
's O
like O
something O
happened O
. O

or O
maybe O
it O
went O
into O
oxygen O
deficiency O
or O
something O
. O

Like O
something O
happened O
to O
her O

and O
she O
was O
asleep O
at O
the O
time O
, O

yeah O
. O

mhm O
. O

and O
so O
she O
did O
n't O
even O
know O
it O
until O
the B-TIME
next I-TIME
morning I-TIME
. O

And O

It O
was O
something O
like O
that O
. O

Wow O
. O

That O
is O
so O
scary O
. O

But O
obviously O
, O
you O
know O
, O
when O
you O
have O
a O
baby O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
its O
life O
and O
your O
life O
, O
you O
have O
to O
worry O
that O
it O
might O
die O
, O
you O
know O
, O
or O
something O
will O
happen O
to O
it O
. O

oh O
I O
know O
it O
is O
so O
scary O
. O

It O
's O
awful O
. O

That O
's O
got O
to O
be O
the O
worst O
thing O
. O

Well O

did O
you O
get O
to O
meet O

Tim O

a O
nice O
house O

I O
started O
looking O

I O
was O
thinking O
about O
California O
style O
homes O

yeah O

had O
a O
beautiful O
house O

I O
never O

about O
it O
a O

they O
had O
a O
really O
nice O
house O
. O

It O
's O
just O
modern O

yeah O

Tim O

house O
right O
? O
Crappy O
house O

house O

and O
then O
his O
%uh O

probably O
took O
him O
for O
half O
of O
it O
now O

so O

I O
'm O
just O
joking O

Who O
knows O

owns O
the O
house O

do O
n't O

that O
other O
one O
too O
that O
had O
a O
really O
nice O
house O
%um O
the O
one O
whose O
husband O
died O
and O
then O
she O
moved O
to O
Los O
Angeles O
and O
they O
never O
heard O
hide O
nor O
hair O
of O
her O
again O
. O

%um O
Arlene O

her O
name O

was O
Philippino O

but O
she O
was O
some O
kind O
of O
Asian O

oh O
I O
do O
n't O
remember O
who O
that O
was O

oh O

You O
remember O
her O

%uh O
no O

I O
do O
n't O

her O

Her O
husband O
went O
down O
to O
Mexico O
Because O
Arlene O
was O
Tim O
's O
wife O

okay O
yeah O

and O
then O
there O
was O
another O
one O

a O
doctor O

appointment O
yesterday O

and O
%uh O
Everything O
is O
fine O

my O
doctor O
is O
like O
the O
most O
non O
%uh O

like O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
whether O
he O
's O
just O
not O
interested O
or O
he O
just O
does O
n't O
care O
or O
what O

but O
he O
told O
me O
I O
did O
n't O
even O
have O
to O
come O
in O
next O
week O
if O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
oh O
if O
I O
could O
find O
someone O
to O
take O
my O
blood O
pressure O

%mm O

What O
was O
it O

take O
my O
blood O
pressure O
and O
check O
my O
urine O
I O
think O

yeah O

I O
'm O
like O
I O
have O
friends O
that O
%uh O
where O
the O
hell O
am O
I O
going O
to O
find O
someone O
to O
do O
that O

Well O
when O
I O
had O
Tyson O
we O
had O
something O
called O
share O
care O
%hm O
because O

well O
you O
said O
that O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
%um O
private O

it O
's O
all O
public O
there O
is O
n't O
%uh O

yeah O

there O
's O
no O
such O
thing O
as O
private O
here O

yeah O

so O
I O
paid O
for O
a O
private O
doctor O

and O
%uh O
if O
I O
had O
private O
health O
insurance O
I O
could O
've O
had O
him O

but O
I O
paid O
for O
him O

and O
%um O
uh-huh O
he O
would O
just O
do O
most O
of O
my O
checkups O
towards O
the O
end O

like O
he O
did O
it O
at O
twenty O
weeks O
and O
then O
like O
at O
twenty O
- O
eight O
weeks O

and O
then O
%um O
as O
of O
about O
I O
think O
the O
last O
month O
I O
had O
to O
see O
him O
once O
a O
week O
now O

yeah O

I O
almost O
could O
've O
bagged O
those O
visits O

and O
it O
's O
a O
good O
thing O
he O
came O
to O
Harvey O
Bay O

he O
does O
n't O
come O
here O
anymore O
now O
that O
the O
only O
private O
obstetrician O
that O
we O
have O
in O
town O
is O
only O
in O
Mayorborough O
okay O
which O
is O
a O
half O
hour O
away O

yeah O

and O
you O
basically O
just O
sit O
in O
the O
office O

and O
you O
come O
in O

and O
they O
just O
take O
your O
blood O
pressure O

and O
they O
talk O
to O
you O
how O
you O
're O
going O

and O
they O
might O
feel O
around O
the O
baby O
a O
little O
bit O

and O
there O
's O
no O
internal O
exam O
of O
course O

and O
then O
that O
's O
it O

I O
mean O
I O
could O
go O
to O
my O
doctor O
and O
do O
the O
same O
. O

so O
I O
'm O
a O
little O
bit O
torn O
as O
to O
how O
to O
go O
next O
time O
as O
far O
as O
%um O
you O
know O
going O
private O
at O
all O

yeah O

I O
would O
be O
so O
much O
different O
if O
I O
had O
a O
baby O
again O

I O
mean O
well O
we O
do O
plan O
actually O
on O
having O
more O
than O
one O

but O
%uh O

yeah O

You O
know O
I O
mean O
I O
just O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
so O
different O

I O
mean O
I O
find O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
see O
the O
doctor O

I O
have O
no O
desire O
to O
see O
the O
doctor O
you O
know O

yeah O

you O
get O
a O
bit O
afraid O
you O
know O

like O
you O
know O
I O
was O
always O
good O
with O
my O
visits O
and O
did O
my O
visits O

and O
I O
sort O
of O
realized O
that O

and O
I O
thought O
I O
would O

yeah O

%uh O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
I O
actually O
did O
my O
follow O
- O
up O
with O
Doctor O
Stokes O
because O

oh O
no O
I O
did O
one O
follow O
- O
up O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

but O
I O
had O
to O
do O
another O
one O

I O
just O
did O
n't O
show O
up O
for O
that O
one O
because O
it O
was O
sort O
of O
ridiculous O
at O
that O
point O

the O
follow O
- O
up O
that O
he O
saw O
me O
after O
I O
had O
the O
baby O
was O
How O
's O
the O
baby O

how O
are O
you O
? O

yeah O

How O
's O
it O
going O

fine O

well O

your O

I O
know O

That O
's O
it O

see O
you O

I O
know O

that O
's O
what O
the O
doctor O
does O

he O
makes O
sure O
that O
the O
baby O
is O
head O
down O

%hm O

He O
takes O
my O
blood O
pressure O

and O
that O
's O
it O
you O
know O

and O
it O
's O
like O
you O
know O
by O
the O
time O
you O
've O
been O
pregnant O
for O
you O
know O
X O
number O
of O
months O
%hm O
you O
're O
the O
one O
who O
's O
going O
to O
know O
whether O
there O
's O
something O
wrong O
more O
than O
the O
doctor O

Yes O

I O
know O

So O
you O
know O
it O
's O
all O
up O
to O
movement O

if O
the O
baby O
stops O
moving O
then O
you O
know O
you O
do O
n't O
call O
up O
the O
doctor O

you O
go O
straight O
to O
the O
hospital O

Absolutely O

So O

yes O

and O
that O
's O
the O
scary O
thing O
is O
n't O
it O

oh O
my O
god O
I O
know O

I O
hate O
it O
when O
he O
stops O
moving O

you O

yeah O

actually O
I O
was O
a O
bit O
bad O
too O
because O
%um O
you O
know O
you O
had O
to O
keep O
register O
of O
%uh O
the O
movement O

mhm O

oh O
no O

they O
do O
n't O
make O

uh-huh O

and O
he O
needs O
to O
know O
whether O
there O
'll O
be O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
set O
up O
, O
or O
just B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
set O
up O

just B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL

now O
the O
set O
up O
would O
be O
you O
know O
, O
everybody O
being O
photographed O
in O
the O
same O
place O

yeah O
, O

I O
know O
, O

yeah O

just B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL

one B-CARDINAL
. O

okay O

and O
then O
he O
needs O
to O
kno- O

but O
just O
tell O
him O
I O
want O
black O
velvet O

%huh O
? O

I O
want O
black O
velvet O
okay O
backdrop O

and O
that O
's O
it O
really O

okay O
. O

okay O
. O

and O
then O
%uh O
, O
he O
needs O
to O
know O
how O
many O
different O
shots O
you O
anticipate O

yeah O

I O
have O
to O
think O
about O
that O
. O

okay O
, O

okay O
. O

we O
'll O

I O
told O
him O
how O
many O
rolls O
I O
wanted O

uh-huh O

%um O
, O
did O
he O
, O

I O
told O
him O
I O
wanted O
ten B-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL
and I-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL
quarter I-CARDINAL

okay O
, O

okay O

but O
I O
think O
it O
might O
actually O
have O
to O
be O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
ten I-CARDINAL

mhm O

Well O
, O
I O
mean O
obviously O
, O
you O
know O
, O
the O
expenses O
go O
up O
the O
more O
he O
has O
to O
shoot O

You O
know O
what O
I O
mean O
? O

yeah O
, O

yeah O

Like O
there O
's O
a O
relationship O
between O
the O
number O
of O
rolls O
he O
shoots O
and O
the O
cost O
of O
the O
whole O
-- O
oh O
yeah O
-- O
thing O

no O
, O
I O
know O
, O

well O
yeah O
, O

because O
he O
has O
to O
take O
it O
to O
a O
place O
and O
then O
got O
a O
contact O
all O
of O
them O
and O
right O
stuff O
like O
that O

right O
, O

right O
. O

Well O
will O
all O
of O
it O
be O
black O
and O
white O
? O

%um O
yes O

yes O
alright O

and O
if O
it O
's O
not O
going O
to O
cost O
too O
much O
, O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
buy O
one O
of O
the O
rolls O
, O

whichever O
roll O
is O
the O
nicest O
one O
uh-huh O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
buy O
that O
roll O

uh-huh O

okay O

okay O

okay O
, O

so O
you O
'll O
have O
to O
think O
about O
how O
many O
different O
shots O
there O
would O
be O
like O
people O
setups O

mhm O
. O

yeah O
. O

okay O
. O

and O
then O
do O
you O
actually O
want O
any O
photograph O
taken O
during O
the O
ceremony O
itself O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
so O
. O

what O
do O
you O
think O

okay O

I O
think O
it O
's O
tacky O
. O

yeah O
. O

no O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
either O
. O

okay O

mommy O
never O
no- O

mommy O
and O
I O
did O
not O
have O
any O
at O
all O

no O

I O
think O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
hard O
enough O
, O

and O
%uh O
yeah O
right O
, O
and O
this O
g- O
I O
do O
n't O
need O
that O

right O

and O
because O
in O
that O
environment O
I O
do O
n't O
, O

I O
think O
you O
're O
right O
on O
that O
, O

I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
awkward O
. O

mhm O

%um O
, O
and O
so O
I O
think O
that O
's O
better O
actually O
, O

so O
, O
if O
you O
know O
, O

this O
way O
he O
could O
just O
take O
all O
the O
pictures O
he O
needs O
to O
take O
actually O
before O
the O
ceremony O
itself O
. O

mhm O
. O

and O
what O
I O
would O
like O
to O
do O
which O
you O
know O
I O
heard O
about O
people O
doing O
elsewhere O
, O
for O
the O
color O
ones O
during O
the O
meal O
%hm O
is O
you O
know O
, O
put O
some O
of O
those O
disposable O
cameras O
on O
some O
tables O
and O
let O
, O
you O
know O

mhm O
mhm O
mhm O

because O
then O
I O
'll O
be O
sure O
to O
get O
pictures O
from O
my O
friends O
and O
stuff O

mhm O
, O
mhm O

yeah O
, O

that O
's O
good O

that O
's O
good O

everything O

What O
do O
you O
think O
of O
that O
? O

yeah O

that O
's O
fine O
. O

okay O

yeah O
, O

I O
think O
that O
's O
fine O
. O

mhm O

okay O
, O

well O
I O
told O
him O
I O
would O
get O
back O
to O
him O
. O

How O
many O
rolls O
did O
you O
tell O
him O
? O

I O
told O
him O
ten B-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL
and I-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL
quarter I-CARDINAL
, O

but O
okay O
I O
think O
it O
's O
going O
to O
have O
to O
be O
more O
than O
that O
. O

uh-huh O

like B-CARDINAL
twelve I-CARDINAL
to I-CARDINAL
fifteen I-CARDINAL
. I-CARDINAL

uh-huh O

yeah O

okay O

well O
anyway O
, O
what O
you O
do O
have O
to O
think O
about O
is O
the O
number O
of O
sort O
of O
people O
poses O

mhm O
. O

yeah O
. O

no O
I O
do O
. O

uh-huh O

because O
I O
mean O
, O
you O
know O
, O
%ah O
, O
he O
has O
to O
allot O
enough O
time O
in O
order O
to O
accomplish O
all O
of O
that O
. O

mhm O

you O
know O
, O
it O
's O
not O
as O
if O
, O

and O
I O
mean O
I O
know O
what O
it O
's O
like O
at O
Drexel B-ORG
you O
know O
, O
when O
we O
have O
bunches O
of O
people O
getting O
their O
pictures O
taken O

mhm O

%uh O
, O
it O
takes O
a O
while O
to O
get O
them O
appropriately O
set O
up O
you O
know O

and O
you O
have O
to O
take O
several O
shots O
of O
each O
grouping O

and O
mhm O
all O
of O
that O
can O
take O
a O
considerable O
amount O
of O
time O

yeah O

yeah O
, O

I O
'll O
think O
about O
all O
that O
. O

yeah O
, O
okay O

and O
%uh O

yeah O
, O

I O
'm O
also O
going O
to O

yeah O
, O

okay O

well O
you O
know O
, O
any O
time O
you O
f- O
, O

you O
could O
probably O
let O
them O
know O
that O
when O
you O
come O
back O
here O

you O
think O
so O

I O
would O
think O
so O

okay O

I O
can O
call O
him O
and O
ask O
him O
, O
%ah O
, O

but O
I O
think O
you O
can O
probably O
let O
them O
know O
pretty O
close O
to O
the O
time O
itself O

okay O

but O
anyway O
, O
we O
'll O
find O

a O
whole O
country O
that O
's O

Everyone O

in O
danger O

I O
do O
n't O
care O
where O

what O
they O

Everyone O

blow O
himself O
up O
it O
makes O
it O
very O
difficult O
. O

Well O

it O
. O

But O
it O

No O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
it O
has O
really O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
sure O
. O

Because O
I O
feel O
that O
the O
people O
would O
like O
to O
seal O
off O
the O
Arab B-NORP
countries O
from O
Gaza B-LOC
, O
for O
example O
and O
just O
not O
let O
them O
come O
in O
anymore O
and O
let O
them O
do O
whatever O
they O
have O
to O
do O
. O

the O

Look O

they O
should O
also O
be O
able O
to O
do O
-- O
Yes O
but O
you O
've O
got O
-- O
and O
determine O
their O
own O
futures O
. O

But O
you O
see O
you O
've O
got O
a O
religious O
element O
both O
here O
in O
America O
and O
in O
Israel O
-- O
-- O
who O
refuse O
to O
give O
up O
-- O
But O
Gaza B-LOC
is O
not O
the O
-- O
g- O
-- O
any O
of O
the O
holy O
land O
. O

yeah O
, O

but O
not O
Gaza B-LOC
. O

not O
Gaza B-LOC
. O

Not O
Gaza B-LOC
. O

Not O
Gaza B-LOC

but O
the O
%uh O

Gaza B-LOC
does O
n't O
come O
under O
this O
thing O
. O

yeah O

but O
the O
%uh O
West B-LOC
Bank I-LOC
and O
so O
on O

yeah O

we O
did O
n't O
get O
to O
that O
yet O
. O

We O
're O
not O
finished O
with O
Gaza B-LOC
. O

We O
've O
got O
no O
end O
. O

we O
do O
n't O
know O
where O
to O
run O
first O
, O
you O
know O
? O

It O
's O
like O
a O
fire O
. O

So O
sad O
. O

uch O
, O
it O
's O
so O
sad O
. O

It O
is O
very O
devastating O
every O
day O
to O
get O
up O
and O
hear O
of O
another O
blast O
. O

It O
's O
very O
devastating O
. O

yeah O
. O

It O
's O
terrible O
. O

And O
you O
know O
I O
get O
up O
early O
. O

I O
got O
up O
at O
five B-TIME
. O

So O
I O
get O
the O
news O
very O
early O
. O
Because O
I O
bring O
in O
the O
-- O
yeah O
the O
bad O
news O
. O
-- O
paper O
and O
hear O
the O
radio O
and O
it O
's O
-- O

That O
's O
terrible O
. O

I O
'm O
just O
worried O
how O
long O
this O
can O
go O
on O
. O
Because O
, O
you O
see O
, O
Rabin B-PERSON
is O
having O
a O
hell O
of O
a O
time O
to O
satisfy O
the O
elements O
. O
You O
know O
. O

Well O
he O
has O
to O
continue O
. O

Well O
of O
course O
. O

%uh O
, O
there O
's O
no O
choice O
. O

He O
must O
continue O
what O
he O
started O
. O

yeah O
. O

You O
see O
Grace B-PERSON
, O
this O
goes O
-- O
No O
. O
-- O
back O
to O
nineteen B-DATE
sixty I-DATE
seven I-DATE
after O
the O
six B-DATE
day I-DATE
war O
. O

Right O
. O

I O
was O
teaching O
Pinchas B-PERSON
Sapir I-PERSON
English B-LANGUAGE
at O
the O
Kiriyah B-FAC

Right O
. O

and O
I O
had O
some O
very O
interesting O
discussions O
with O
him O
back O
-- O
mhm O
. O
-- O
then O
when O
I O
said O
to O
him O
we O
've O
go O
to O
settle O
with O
the O
Arabs B-NORP
before O
they O
get O
strong O

and O
he O
laughed O
at O
me O
. O

I O
said O
some O
day O
you O
'll O
know O
what O
I O
have O
said O
. O

Yes O
. O

This O
should O
be O
settled O
because O
the O
longer O
you O
wait O
the O
stronger O
they O
become O
. O

It O
should O
have O
been O
settled O
in O
nineteen B-DATE
sixty I-DATE
seven I-DATE
. O

We O
should O
have O
given O
it O
back O
right O
then O
and O
there O
. O

And O
get O
it O
over O
with O
. O

yeah O

because O

But O
you O
see O

Well O
I O
'm O
very O
mad O
with O
Golda B-PERSON
because O
she O
refused O
to O
do O
it O
. O

But O
you O
see O
the O
whole O
thing O
was O
we O
're O
proud O

we O
showed O
them O
we O
could O
defeat O
them O

and O
so O
therefore O
why O
should O
we O
talk O
to O
them O

they O
're O
the O
underdog O
now O
. O

And O
so O
I O
will O
never O
forget O
what O
some O
of O
the O
girls O
said O
to O
me O
in O
seminar O
Levinsky B-PERSON
-- O
oh O
it O
's O
too O
terrible O
. O
-- O
when O
I O
brought O
up O
the O
issue O

they O
were O
ready O
to O
choke O
me O

they O
said O
what O
do O
you O
mean O

they O
were O
ready O
to O
throw O
us O
into O
the O
sea O

now O
we O
can O
throw O
them O
into O
the O
sea O
. O

Well O
yeah O
. O
I O
still O
remember O
those O
discussions O

and O
I O
said O
from O
the O
beginning O
this O
is O
wrong O
. O

Well O
, O
this O
is O
what O
's O
happened O
. O

Of O
course O
it O
's O
wrong O
. O

You O
see O
nations O
make O
mistakes O
. O

tough O
luck O

they O
did O
n't O
like O
us O
anyway O
. O

%eh O
%eh O
the O
best O
news O
is O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

Well O
that O
the O
world O
can O
at O
least O
see O
something O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
yet O
what O
will O
be O
with O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

You O
never O
know O
, O

you O
never O
know O
the O
game O
. O

Well O
You O
never O
know O

but O
there O
is O
a O
well O
, O

but O
the O
response O
of O
the O
world O
should O
be O
very O
strong O
against O
him O
. O

Now O
Grace B-PERSON
are O
you O
looking O
for O
justice O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
where O
justice O
exists O
. O

No O

I O
'm O
not O
looking O
for O
justice O
. O

I O
'm O
looking O
for O
an O
end O
to O
these O
hostilities O
. O

Well O
if O
you O
look O
at O
justice O
, O
you O
would O
think O
-- O
That O
's O
all O
. O
-- O
that O
Iraq B-GPE
should O
've O
been O
killed O
a O
long O
time O
ago O
. O

But O
I O
've O
given O
up O
on O
justice O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
where O
justice O
exists O
anymore O
. O

yeah O
, O

but O
I O
want O
to O
tell O
you O
something O
Ida B-PERSON
. O

The O
average O
person O
on O
the O
street O
like O
you O
and O
me O
one O
day O
he O
's O
got O
to O
prevail O

he O
just O
simply O
has O
to O
. O

I O
can O
assure O
you O
that O
those O
Arab B-NORP
women O
feel O
the O
same O
thing O
about O
their O
sons O
that O
we O
feel O
about O
ours O
. O

Of O
course O
. O
Of O
course O
. O

There O
's O
no O
question O
. O

And O
one O
day O
the O
people O
will O
have O
enough O
of O
it O
. O

I O
believe O
in O
the O
people O
Ida O
. O

Of O
course O
. O

I O
really O
do O
. O

Of O
course O
. O
Of O
course O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
believe O
in O
justice O

but O
I O
believe O
in O
the O
common O
man O
. O

He O
'll O
have O
it O
up O
to O
his O
eyelashes O

and O
he O
wo O
n't O
be O
able O
to O
stand O
it O
anymore O

Captain O
Picard B-PERSON
. O

%mm O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
which O
one O
that O
is O
. O

yeah O
that O
's O
the O
earlier O
one O
. O

I O
like O
the O
new O
one O
Next B-WORK_OF_ART
Generation I-WORK_OF_ART

that O
's O
pretty O
cool O

you O
should O
look O
into O
it O

uh-huh O
. O

Anyway O

You O
're O
so O
bad O
. O

Anyway O

so O
that O
's O
why O
I O
'm O
yawning O
. O

%um O
but O
%um O
anyway O
%uh O

what O
was O
I O
going O
to O
say O
%um O

so O
it O
took O
me O
a O
while O
to O
settle O
in O
because O

and O
I O
'm O
still O
not O
totally O
settled O
in O
. O

I O
've O
started O
to O
do O
%um O
some O
work O

the O
first B-ORDINAL
month O
that O
I O
was O
here O
I O
took O
a O
class O
in O
digital O
music O
%um O
which O
is O
like O
electronic O
you O
know O
like O
music O
editing O
and O
stuff O
like O
that O
. O

oh O
cool O

mhm O

oh O
that O
's O
great O
. O

And O
because O
I O
've O
been O
you O
know O
working O
with O
sound O
and O
I O
'm O
interested O
in O
working O
more O
with O
sound O
and O
stuff O

and O
so O
that O
was O
really O
good O

there O
was O
a O
concert O
at O
the O
end O
of O
it O

and O
I O
felt O
that O
's O
great O
pretty O
good O
about O
my O
contribution O
to O
that O

like O
it O
was O
n't O
really O
exactly O
what O
I O
would O
want O

but O
I O
felt O
like O
I O

oh O
that O
's O
great O
. O

yeah O

so O
that O
was O
good O

that O
was O
something O
that O
you O
know O
like O
being O
here O
gave O
me O
access O
to O
. O

I O
'm O
also O
learning O
a O
lot O
%um O
like O
about O
other O
things O
about O
computers O
like O
about O
%um O
you O
know O
how O
to O
do O
email O
and O
how O
to O
do O
like O
Email O
's O
interesting O
. O
networking O

yeah O

yeah O

I O
mean O
if O
you O
get O
a O
laptop O
and O
you O
should O
also O
try O
to O
get O
a O
modem O
and O
hook O
it O
up O
to O
a O
phone O
because O
then O
you O
can O
have O

I O
may O
have O
to O

well O
I O
mean O
like O
I O
have O
a O
an O
email O
address O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
who O
else O
that O
you O
know O
has O
an O
email O
address O

but O
it O
's O
the O
kind O
of O
thing O
that O
I O
would O
like O

I O
'm O
trying O
to O
t- O

You O
can O
get O
contact O
with O
people O
easy O
. O

yeah O

I O
'm O
trying O
to O
like O
tell O
people O
because O
it O
only O
costs O
like O
a O
local O
phone O
call O

like O
I O
mean O
if O
you O
wanted O
to O
write O
to O
somebody O
in O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
you O
could O
like O
type O
it O
up O

It O
's O
like O
%eh O
a O
fax O
%uh O
thing O
. O

yeah O

but O
it O
's O
better O

it O
's O
even O
cheaper O
than O
a O
fax O
I O
think O
because O
it O
's O
%um O

yeah O

and O
it O
goes O
into O
the O
computer O

it O
's O
not O
like O
with O
paper O
. O

Right O

it O
's O
not O
with O
paper O

and O
it O
's O
cheaper O
because O
it O
's O
the O
cost O
of O
a O
local O
phone O
call O
whereas O
a O
fax O
takes O
the O
amount O
of O
time O
that O
the O
phone O
call O

oh O
that O
's O
great O
. O

No O

it O
's O
really O
great O

and O
then O
you O
can O
get O
access O
to O
any O
information O
you O
really O
need O

I O
mean O
if O
you O
needed O
something O
about O
research O
or O
whatever O
you O

Right O

right O

yeah O

This O
is O
amazing O
to O
me O
. O

yeah O

so O
yeah O
like O
the O
internet O
and O
all O
that O
kind O
of O
stuff O

so O
that O
's O
like O

so O
I O
'm O
learning O
about O
that O

so O
that O
's O
kind O
of O
cool O

%uh O
That O
's O
great O
and O
I O
'm O
supposed O
to O
start O
teaching O
in O
September B-DATE
. O

I O
mean O
I O
'm O
a O
little O
bit O
nervous O
about O
that O
because O
I O
have O
to O
still O
put O
together O
%um O
like O
a O
course O
syllabus O
and O

Joan B-PERSON
get O
to O
work O

's O
two B-DATE
weeks I-DATE

like O

's O

I O
'm O
just O
joking O

but O

uh-huh O

one O
second O

The B-ORG
University I-ORG
of I-ORG
Pennsylvania I-ORG
%um O

oh O
fanta- O

%ah O
America B-GPE

So O
anyway O

so O

%um O
well O
yeah O

it O
's O
like O
I O
am O
a O
little O
ner- O

I O
mean O
the O
thing O
is O
I O
've O
never O
taught O
a O
class O

well O
that O
's O
not O
true O
. O

I O
taught O
the O
same O
class O
in O
Germany B-GPE

but O
it O
was O
different O
%um O

yeah O

what O
about O
upstate B-LOC
New I-LOC
York I-LOC

you O
did O
it O

you O
teach O

I O
was O
teaching O
three B-CARDINAL
D O
design O
which O
is O
really O
different O
because O
that O
was O
freshmen O

these O
are O
like O
graduate O
students O
I O
think O

oh O
really O

oh O
that O
's O
intense O

well O
how O
often O
do O
you O
see O
them O

it O
's O
twice O
a O
week O
for O
th- O

we O
meet O
for O
three B-TIME
hours I-TIME

and O
%um O

anyway O
so O
that O
's O
going O
on O

so O
%um O

That O
's O
great O
though O
. O

but O
I O
mean O
it O
's O
good O

it O
's O
weird O

like O
I O
've O
been O
having O
you O
know O

the O
thing O
you O
're O
saying O
like O
about O
you O
know O
like O
giving O
up O
the O
apartment O
in O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
and O
those O
kinds O
of O
things O
I O
mean O
I O
've O
been O
thinking O
about O
those O
kinds O
of O
things O
again O
also O
yeah O
. O
because O
you O
know O
I O
think O
to O
myself O
like O
you O
know O
I O
could O
make O
life O
easier O
for O
myself O

I O
could O
come O
to O
Berlin B-GPE

I O
could O
probably O
like O
you O
know O
you O
know O
you O
know O
get O
the O
paperwork O
in O
order O
and O
make O
a O
way O

very O
easily O
. O

oh O
I O
got O
your O
%um O
message O
today O
. O

I O
wrote O
you O
back O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
you O
checked O
it O
or O
not O
. O

%um O
I O
was O
there O
in O
the O
afternoon O
. O

%mm O
. O

%um O
which O
message O
? O

yeah O

yeah O

you O
did O

oh O
about O
the O
prayers O
like O

yeah O

yeah O

did O
you O
get O
that O
one O
? O

mhm O
. O

okay O
. O

edit O

so O
you O
did O
n't O
get O
my O
answer O
? O

oh O
no O

no O

I O
wrote O
you O
back O
. O

I O
answered O
you O
back O
oh O
he O
is O
at O
another O
time O
because O
I O
read O
your O
message O

oh O
great O

she O
says O
something O
totally O
opposite O
of O
what O
the O
other O
person O
said O

what O
am O
I O
going O
to O
do O
. O

So O
I O
just O
wrote O
this O
long O
drawn O
out O
thing O
on O
the O
net O

and O
I O
was O
like O

complaining O
about O
all O
the O
different O
versions O
of O
every O
rule O
that O
you O
ever O
hear O
. O

No O

%um O
I O
got O
kind O
of O
personal O
with O
it O
because O
I O
always O
like O
start O
off O
you O
know O

and O
he O
'd O
answer O
, O
bah O
bah O
bah O
, O

and O
then O
I O
'd O
just O
end O
up O
like O
talking O
about O
myself O
like O
you O
know O
because O
I O
know O
people O
are O
wondering O
oh O
why O
does O
she O
want O
to O
know O
how O
you O
make O
up O
a O
prayer O
you O
know O
Well O
I O
mean O
it O
happens O
to O
everybody O
. O
and O
all O
that O
other O
stuff O

yeah O

but O
some O
people O
are O
on O
this O
like O
kick O
that O
you O
know O
you O
're O
not O
supposed O
to O
ask O
stuff O
like O
that O
you O
know O
like O
what O
Dalia B-PERSON
will O
post O
on O
the O
net O
. O

I O
bet O
some O
people O
are O
freaking O
out O
over O
that O

and O
I O
think O
that O
's O
perfectly O
natural O
to O
want O
to O
know O
, O
you O
know O
, O
stuff O
like O
that O
? O

yeah O

I O
mean O
that O
was O
the O
purpose O
of O
this O
net O
. O

yeah O

but O
some O
people O
like O

%um O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
you O
were O
on O
%um O
last O
year O
when O
%um O
Jemilla B-PERSON

I O
just O
started O
. O

yeah O

there O
was O
this O
big O
thing O
%um O
last B-DATE
year I-DATE

and O
I O
took O
myself O
off O
because O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
deal O
with O
it O
. O

This O
%um O
sister O
she O
wrote O
about O
%uh O
this O
like O
cookie O
dough O
thing O
you O
know O
one O
of O
those O
like O
sexually O
perverted O
kind O
of O
jokey O
kind O
of O
postings O
things O

and O
so O
everyone O
was O
so O
offended O

and O
like O
you O
know O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
arguing O
back O
and O
forth O
. O

They O
got O
really O
petty O

and O
mhm O
. O
it O

taken O
out O
of O
context O

and O
people O
get O
offended O
and O
stuff O
like O
that O
. O

yeah O

and O
plus O
because O
your O
're O
dealing O
with O
so O
many O
completely O
different O
kinds O
of O
people O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
really O
realize O
that O
though O
. O

I O
thought O
it O
was O
I O
%eh O

this O
is O
a O
really O
diverse O
network O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
know O
there O
was O
so O
many O
people O
. O

yeah O

so O
people O
where O
getting O
mad O
at O
Delila B-PERSON
's O
though O
? O

I O
mean O
just O
read O
in O
the O
post O

people O

like O
you O
know O

All O
right O

I O
mean O
not O
today O

I O
'm O
supposed O

Really O
, O

Michigan B-GPE
? O

No O
she O
lives O
in O
Chicago B-GPE
. O

oh O
. O

But O
I O
'm O
going O
up O
to O
Chicago B-GPE
because O
there O
's O
%um O
this O
Sufi O
conference O

oh O

and O
%um O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
stay O
with O
her O
until O
%uh O

oh O
that O
's O
great O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
wait O
. O

yeah O
, O

should O
be O
fun O

Because O
I O
have O
not O
left O
my O

well O
I O
mean O
I O
was O
in O
Germany B-GPE
for O
one O
year O

and O
then O
I O
came O
back O
from O
Germany B-GPE
last O
fall O

mhm O
. O

and O
then O
I O
have O
not O
been O
anywhere O
except O
for O
my O
house O
and O
school O
since O
then O
oh O
. O
and O
like O
the O
road O
in O
between O

it O
's O
like O
I O
got O
to O
get O
out O
. O

yeah O

that O
's O
good O

so O
how O
long O
is O
the O
conference O
? O

It O
's O
just O
for O
one B-CARDINAL
day O
. O

oh O

And O
it O
's O
free O
. O

That O
's O
the O
best O
thing O
about O
it O
. O

It O
's O
free O
? O

yeah O
. O

Wow O
. O

yeah O
. O

You O
just O
have O
to O
find O
the O
means O
to O
get O
there O
, O
right O
? O

for O
some O
reason O
I O

yeah O
, O

I O
am O
going O
to O
take O
the O
train O
, O
I O
think O
. O

oh O
. O

%mm O
So O
you O
're O
still O
going O
to O
go O
to O
the O

yeah O
, O

I O
want O
to O
actually O
a O
little O

I O
mean O
%eh O
Robin B-PERSON
already O
like O
paid O
for O
everything O

so O
I O
feel O
really O
bad O
if O
I O
do O
n't O
go O

and O
I O
think O
he O
's O
kind O
of O
counting O
on O
me O
to O
go O
too O

so O
yeah O
. O
I O
'm O
just O
going O
to O
go O
. O

all O
I O
have O
to O
do O
is O
find O
a O
way O
to O
get O
there O
which O
I O
have O
n't O
found O
yet O

and O
it O
's O
really O

oh O
really O
? O

yeah O

it O
's O
coming O
up O
really O
soon O
. O

Because O
I O
thought O
you O
got O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
I O
'll O
take O
a O
plane O
there O

but O
%uh O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O

a O
bus O
or O
a O
train O
or O
something O
. O

oh O

because O
I O
mean O
if O
you O
got O
here O
you O
could O
probably O
ride O
with O
Robin B-PERSON
. O

yeah O
, O

I O
was O
thinking O
of O
that O
too O

but O
I O
do O
n't O
even O

But O
that O
will O
probably O
cost O
the O
same O
just O
to O
come O
here O
as O

yeah O
. O

I O
brought O

like O
she O
said O
she O
was O
driving O
alone O

so O
I O
would O
n't O
mind O

like O
I O
even O
said O
to O
her O
you O
know O
I O
'll O
come O
there O

and O
then O
I O
can O
drive O
with O
you O
. O

yeah O

actually O
I O
kind O
of O
probably O

I O
mean O
, O
is O
she O
driving O
there O
by O
herself O
? O

yeah O
. O

yeah O

because O
I O
mean O
I O
think O
she O
's O
okay O
right O
now O

but O
it O
would O
be O
much O
better O
if O
she O
did O
n't O
have O
to O
drive O
by O
herself O
. O

yeah O
, O

I O
think O
so O
too O

you O
know O
I O
want O
to O
do O
that O

but O
I O
think O
she O
does O
n't O
want O
me O
to O
go O
through O
all O
that O
trouble O

yeah O
. O

but O
I O
told O
her O
it O
's O
no O
big O
deal O
. O

I O
figure O
take O
the O
bus O
or O
the O
train O
there O
and O
then O
we O
can O
drive O
down O
together O
you O
know O
. O

yeah O
, O

I O
mean O
I O
think O
that O
would O
be O
nice O
. O

I O
mean O
and O
also O
because O
it O
is O
nice O
like O
if O
you O
are O
going O
to O
a O
big O
place O
not O
to O
go O
along O
yeah O
because O
who O
knows O
how O
hard O
it O
'll O
be O
to O
find O
somebody O
once O
you O
're O
there O

right O

and O
I O
'll O
be O
alone O

I O
wo O
n't O
know O
anything O
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
she O
's O
been O
here O
before O
like O
to O
the O
conference O

but O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
she O
's O
been O
to O
Ohio B-GPE
, O
right O
? O

yeah O
. O

yeah O

It O
's O
in O
Columbus B-GPE
? O

yeah O
, O

and O
also O
I O
'm O
kind O
of O
worried O
about O
her O
because O
like O
you O
d- O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
she O
talked O
to O
you O
about O
her O
health O

yeah O
, O

she O
has O
. O

yeah O

%eh O
yeah O

yeah O

because O
there O
's O

I O
mean O
a O
few O
weeks O
ago O
she O
was O
like O
losing O
control O
of O
her O
hand O

and O
%uh O
now O
she O
's O
on O
some O
kind O
of O
medication O
that O
's O
like O
put O
it O
back O

like O
she O
can O
use O
her O
hands O
again O

mhm O
. O

But O
like O
she O
had O
to O
have O
her O
hand O
bandaged O
up O
and O
stuff O

and O
like O
she O
was O
having O
a O
real O
hard O
time O
at O
work O

so O
that O
would O
me O
nervous O
like O
if O
she O
was O
going O
to O
drive O
by O
herself O
you O
know O

like O
what O
happens O
you O
know O
if O
something O
**cooky** O
goes O
wrong O
with O
her O
hand O
and O
she O
ca O
n't O
drive O

but O
I O
guess O
she O
's O
taking O
some O
medication O
now O

so O
I O
guess O
it O
's O
okay O

but O

%hm O
. O

yeah O
, O

I O
tried O
calling O
her O
tonight O

but O
I O
got O
her O
answering O
machine O

so O
I O
left O
her O
a O
message O
to O
her O

%hm O

She O
calls O
me O
back O
I O
'll O
tell O
her O
that O
's O
what O
I O
'll O
do O
because O
I O
was O
thinking O
about O
that O
too O

but O
you O
know O
she O
like O
throws O
it O
off O
make O
it O
seems O
like O
it O
's O
no O
big O
deal O

and O
I O
think O
oh O
well O

but O
%um O

well O
just O
tell O
her O
that O
you O
'd O
prefer O
her O
company O
or O
something O

then O
it O
wo O
n't O
be O
like O
you O
know O
she O
does O
n't O
want O
to O
put O
you O
out O
for O
%um O
you O
know O
inconvenience O

but O
if O
you O
make O
it O
sound O
like O
you O
want O
to O
do O
it O
then O
she O
'll O
probably O
agree O
. O

yeah O

yeah O
. O

So O
you O
still O
are O
not O
thinking O
of O
going O
, O
right O
? O

No O
, O
I O
think O
not O
. O

yeah O
. O

yeah O
, O

I O
mean O
because O
even O
before O
all O
that O
weird O
stuff O
you O
know O
I O
've O
been O
talking O
about O
I O
've O
always O
like O
had O
a O
kind O
of O
weird O
feeling O
about O
them O
anyway O
. O

I O
mean O
the O
whole O
organization O
just O
because O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
it O
seems O
kind O
of O
strange O

like O
%um O
I O
do O
n't O
know O

it O
's O
hard O
to O
explain O

but O
just O
real O
%um O

Like O
someone O
me O
today O

and O
you O
know O
she O
said O
you O
know O
we O
should O
really O
go O
to O
a O
conference O
you O
know O
as O
a O
group O
because O
I O
'll O
be O
living O
with O
like O
four B-CARDINAL
or O
five B-CARDINAL
sisters O
this O
fall O
who O
rented O
a O
place O

yeah O
. O

and O
so O
she O
said O
%um O
you O
know O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
if O
we O
could O
go O
to O
a O
conference O

but O
it O
would O
have O
to O
be O
all O
females O
because O
she O
hears O
that O
some O
of O
them O
are O
meat O
markets O

so O
I O
've O
heard O
other O
th- O

oh O
really O
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
I O
was O
like O
whoa O
you O
know O
I O
did O
n't O
even O
think O
of O
that O

but O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
true O
. O

A O
lot O
of O
%eh O
People O
looking O
for O
a O
eligible O
women O
right O
yeah O
in O
one O
place O

but O
I O
do O
n't O
know O

I O
do O
n't O
know O

%mm O

If O
I O
hate O
the O
experience O
then O
I O
'll O
never O
go O
to O
another O
one O

but O
if O
it O
turns O
out O
to O
be O
okay O
then O
you O
know O
it O
's O
okay O

yeah O
. O

I O
mean O
I O
heard O
I O
mean O
that O
it O
is O
enjoyable O
you O
know O

people O
talk O
about O
you O
know O
religious O
things O
and O
get O
really O
into O
it O
and O
stuff O

yeah O
. O

%um O
I O
guess O
that O
what O
I O
had O
heard O
bad O
about O
it O
was O
just O
that O
they O
were O
so O
into O
talking O
about O
like O
%um O
the O
Koran B-WORK_OF_ART
and O
stuff O
but O
that O
they O
were O
n't O
using O
this O
as O
being O
like O
a O
tool O
for O
social O
change O
at O
all O
like O
they O
were O
n't O
talking O
about O
what O
we O
could O
possibly O
do O
%mm O
. O
As O
Muslims B-NORP
to O
like O
improve O
the O
world O
but O
rather O
well O
just O
spend O
all O
your O
time O
praying O
kind O
of O
philosophy O
. O

oh O
. O

And O
%um O
so O
e- O

Nine B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
people O
and O
that O
's O
it O
, O
%huh O
? O

%huh O
? O

I O
said O
nine B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
people O
and O
that O
's O
all O
they O
find O
to O
do O
with O
that O

you O
know O
they O
have O
like O
%uh O
%uh O
a O
large O
group O
of O
people O
, O

they O
could O
really O
make O
a O
difference O

but O
they O

I O
do O
n't O
know O

I O
have O
n't O
been O
to O
one O

so O
I O
d- O

yeah O

yeah O

I O
have O
n't O
been O
to O
it O
either O

so O
I O
ca O
n't O
really O
talk O
. O

%mm O

But O
, O

yeah O
, O

I O
think O
that O
they O
just O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
get O
really O
radical O
Right O
. O
I O
mean O
because O
I O
guess O
like O
Saudi B-GPE
Arabia I-GPE
funds O
it O
a O
lot O

and O
%um O

yeah O
, O

they O
were O
talking O
about O
Azum O

is O
that O
the O
person O
's O
name O
Azarahim B-PERSON

I O
've O
never O
heard O
of O
like O
this O
person O

yeah O
, O

I O
've O
never O
heard O
of O
him O
either O
. O

and O
they O
said O
that O
he O
's O
a O
murderer O
and O
stuff O
like O
that O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

And O
then O
there O
's O
the O
Mike B-PERSON
Tyson I-PERSON
thing O
that O
a O
lot O
of O
us O
have O

not O
too O
you O
know O
happy O
about O
that O
. O

yeah O

And O
%uh O

Well O
, O
it O
will O
be O
interesting O
to O
see O
what O
he O
has O
to O
say O
. O

yeah O

Did O
you O
read O
my O
post O
like O
what O
I O
wrote O
about O
him O
and O
stuff O
like O

That O
he O
was O
talking O
about O
his O
girlfriend O
or O
something O
. O

yeah O
, O

he O
's O
talking O
about O
well O
I O
ca O
n't O
even O
kiss O
my O
girlfriend O

and O
I O
was O
like O
no O
you O
do O
n't O
do O
that O
to O
your O
girlfriend O
, O

what O
is O
that O
. O

So O
it O
's O
like O
he O
does O
n't O
really O
know O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

he O
does O
n't O
even O
have O
the O
basics O
down O
you O
know O

like O
like O
we O
were O
at O
the O
beginning O
stage O

like O
I O
have O
the O
basics O
down O

and O
that O
's O
it O

but O
he O
does O
n't O
even O
have O
that O

like O
I O
mean O
there O
was O
no O
like O
girlfriend O
boyfriend O
thing O
you O
know O
, O
and O
other O
stuff O
. O

No O
pork O
any O
of O
that O
stuff O

but O
it O
's O
like O
he O
's O
just O
you O
know O
yeah O
I O
out O
of O
it O
. O

He O
does O
n't O
have O
control O
over O
his O
life O
. O

That O
's O
what O
I O
think O

and O
so O
you O
know O
when O
people O
rag O
on O
him O
I O
tend O
to O
take O
like O
the O
side O
of O
you O
know O
like O
Mike B-PERSON
Tyson I-PERSON
because O
he O
really O
does O
n't O
know O
. O

I O
mean O
he O
knew O
what O
he O
did O

but O
it O
's O
not O
all O
him O
, O
you O
know O
. O

Other O
people O
control O
him O
and O
tell O
him O
what O
to O
do O
and O
where O
to O
spend O
his O
money O
and O
stuff O
like O
that O
. O

yeah O

I O
mean O
I O
generally O
just O
stay O
away O
from O
the O
T O
V O
anyway O
. O

yeah O
, O

I O
'm O
a O
T O
V O
magnet O
. O

So O
I O
never O
know O
about O
these O
things O
except O
for O
when O
people O
talk O
about O
it O

I O
'm O
a O
T O
V O
magnet O
. O

So O
%um O
I O
forgot O
what O
you O
did O
, O

you O
're O
a O
grad O
student O
, O
right O
? O

No O
, O
actually O
I O
'm O
the O
%uh O
eternal O
bachelor O
's O
student O
. O

You O
're O
a O
what O
? O

A O
bachelor O
's O
or O
undergrad O
or O
whatever O
you O
call O
it O
? O

oh O
really O
. O

yeah O
. O

What O
year O
are O
you O
? O

Working O
on O

I O
think O
this O
is O
my O
fifth B-ORDINAL
year O
. O

oh O
really O
. O

oh O
that O
's O
not O
bad O
. O

I O
'll O
be O
a O
fifth B-ORDINAL
year O
. O

I O
mean O
I O
wo O
n't O
be O
one O
next B-DATE
year I-DATE

but O
it O
's O
going O
to O
get O
to O
that O
point O

I O
ca O
n't O
finish O
my O
major O
in O
three O
years O
. O

I O
'm O
going O
to O
need O
three B-CARDINAL
because O
my O
first B-ORDINAL
two B-DATE
years I-DATE
I O
ca O
n't O
tell O
you O
what O
I O
did O
with O
those O

yeah O

So O
%uh O
it O
's O
like O
I O
'm O
in O
the O
same O
boat O
too O
. O

yeah O
, O

what O
do O
you O
ma- O

But O
you O
've O
already O
graduated O
though O
, O
right O
? O

What O
? O

You O
've O
already O
graduated O
, O
right O
? O

No O
, O

see O
I O
'm O
working O
on O
like O
three B-CARDINAL
degrees O
at O
one O
time O

so O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
another B-DATE
three I-DATE
years I-DATE
before O
I O
graduate O
. O
oh O
. O
Unless O
I O
just O
decide O
to O
give O
up O
and O
just O
take O
what O
I O
've O
got O
. O

So O
what O
do O
you O
have O
so O
far O
? O

or O
do O
you O

Well O
right O
now O
if O
I O

I O
could O
graduate O
with O
a O
German B-NORP
degree O
right O
now O

mhm O
. O

but O
German B-NORP
degree O
is O
useless O
. O
Right O
. O
Unless O
you O
get O
a O
P O
h O
D O
or O
something O
. O

mhm O
. O

So O
, O
I O
'm O
also O
working O
on O
an O
English B-LANGUAGE
degree O
because O
that O
's O
my O
real O
interest O
. O

You O
really O

English B-LANGUAGE
literature O
, O
right O
? O

yeah O

well O
what O
I O
really O
really O
love O
is O
like O
medieval O
stuff O

oh O
wow O
. O

and O
that O
's O
why O
I O
really O
think O
that O
like O
English B-LANGUAGE
and O
German B-LANGUAGE
goes O
together O
really O
well O
if O
you O
're O
interested O
in O
medieval O
%mm O
. O
because O
%um O
in O
the O
past O
English B-LANGUAGE
and O
German B-LANGUAGE
used O
to O
be O
the O
same O
language O
like O
before O
the O
year O
seven O
hundred O
. O

Wow O
. O

You O
know O
, O
because O
like O
in O
Europe B-GPE
it O
was O
all O
like O
wandering O
pagan O
tribes O
and O
you O
know O
they O
came O
down O
the O
Goths B-NORP
and O
all O
them O

mhm O
. O

like O
I O
mean O
they O
spoke O
Germanic B-NORP
language O

and O
some O
of O
them O
settled O
in O
Germany B-GPE

and O
some O
people O
kept O
on O
walking O
and O
kept O
on O
going O
to O
England B-LANGUAGE

and O
so O
the O
language O
gradually O
changed O
after O
that O

Wow O
. O

%um O
I O
took O
them O
to O
%uh O
Jill O
's O

and O
they O
spent O
two B-DATE
days I-DATE
there O

and O
I O
guess O
she O
could O
n't O
take O
them O

and O
their O
mom O
and O
dad O
came O
. O

You O
mean O
in O
Texas B-GPE
? O

yeah O
. O

And O
their O
mom O
and O
dad O
drove O
down O
there O
and O
got O
them O
. O

mhm O

Got O
them O
. O

yeah O
. O

So O
how O
are O
they O
getting O
back O
? O

Driving O
them O

driving O
them O
back O
. O

oh O
. O

Darn O
it O
. O

I O
thought O
I O
was O
going O
to O
get O
to O
see O
everybody O
. O

Well O
They O
was O
supposed O
to O
%um O
come O
back O
like O
a O
while O
ago O

but O
Jill B-PERSON
like O
she O
keeps O
farting O
around O
and O
wo O
n't O
want O
to O
go O
get O
them O

and O

%mm O
. O

So O
I O
said O

and O
then O
she O
j- O

Did O
she O
have O
her O
baby O
yet O
? O

yeah O
. O

She O

You O

in O
Illinois O
recently O

Her O

Well O
Jill B-PERSON

at O

You O

Well O

sucked O
into O

. O

oh O
I O
'm O
not O
. O

Her O
baby O
's O
got O
colic O

and O
she O
did O
funny O
. O

oh O
. O

Sounds O
like O
a O
real O
mess O
. O

Too O
bad O
. O

So O
is O
she O
home O
for O
good O
? O

No O
. O

He O
took O
her O
back O
? O

No O
. O

He O
did O
n't O
take O
her O
back O

but O
his O
%uh O
mom O
was O
going O
to O
buy O
her O
a O
car O
-- O
-- O
so O
that O
she O
'd O
stay O
out O
there O

and O
sure O
enough O
she O
's O
staying O
out O
there O
. O

oh O
yeah O
. O

She O
working O

. O

%huh O
? O

She O
working O
it O

So O
anyway O
she O
called O
me O
a B-DATE
couple I-DATE
days I-DATE
before O
she O
was O
going O
to O
come O
home O

and O
I O

not O
wanted O
in O
a O
state O
you O
know O
where O
you O
do O
n't O

hardly O
anybody O
. O

So O
then O
that O
's O
when O
it O
all O
came O
out O

I O
think O
her O
name O

going O
to O
buy O
me O
a O
car O
. O

She O
's O
going O
to O
help O
me O
out O
. O

I O
said O
Kara B-PERSON
you O
know O
why O
she O
's O
going O
to O
do O
that O
is O
because O
she O
wants O
the O
kid O
to O
stay O
there O
so O
she O
can O
see O
your O
grandson O
. O

mhm O
. O

so O
she O
got O
all O
pissed O
off O
at O
me O
. O

I O
said O
you O
're O
being O
used O
. O

You O
're O
being O
bought O
. O

Man O
she O
going O
to O
be O
like O
Jill B-PERSON

I O
said O
why O
do O
n't O
you O
stand O
up O
on O
your O
own O
two B-CARDINAL
feet O
. O

She O
going O
to O
be O
like O
Jill B-PERSON
and O
become O
a O
product O
of O
the O
state O
and O
shit O
live O
off O
welfare O
and O
god O
damn O
. O

Then O
you O
know O
what O
she O
said O
to O
me O
? O

What O
. O

She O
said O

&uh O
, O
and O
this O
sounded O
just O
like O
something O
like O
%uh O
her O
mother O

law O
or O
I O
do O
n't O

the O
hell O
relationsh- O

would O
n't O
be O
mother O

law O
. O
What O
%uh O
Drew B-PERSON

saying O
to O
her O
. O

Kara B-PERSON
says O
well O

to O
do O
what O
's O
right O

David B-PERSON
. O

And O
I O
said O

Kara B-PERSON
you O
have O
to O
do O
what O
's O
right O
for O
Kara B-PERSON
. O

And O
what O
's O
right O
for O
Kara B-PERSON
will O
be O
right O
for O
David B-PERSON
. O

That O
's O
right O
. O

As O
long O
as O
you O
feed O
him O
, O
love O
him O
and O
take O
care O
of O
him O
. O

oh O
well O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
him O
to O
not O
know O
his O
daddy O
. O

I O
'm O
like O

. O

I O
bet O

n't O
you O
think O
they O

And O
%uh O

Mentally O

anymore O
. O
-- O
contact O

. O

I O
mean O
that O

the O
last O
time O
they O
were O

so O
. O

But O
it O
's O
never O
their O

. O

It O
's O
never O
for O
anything O
that O
they O
've O
done O
. O

I O

and O
all O
that O
I O
mean O
. O

Well O
I O
do O
n't O
get O
it O
for O
that O

%um O
so O
then O
dad O
says O
now O
why O
do O
n't O
you O
want O
to O
go O
to O
Des B-GPE
Moines I-GPE

and O
I O
said O
because O
I O
do O
n't O
. O

I O
said O
I O
thought O
we O
'd O
already O
been O
through O
this O
cause O
I O
already O
told O
them O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
go O
to O
Des O
M&oines O
. O

And O
he O
goes O
well O
then O
we O
'll O
drive O
to O
Omaha B-GPE
and O
pick O
up O
%um O
Ryan B-PERSON

and O
then O
we O
'll O
%uh O
bring O
him O
back O
home O
to O
Omaha B-GPE
. O

And O
I O
said O
%mm O
. O
oh O
so O
you O
're O
not O

and O
the O
whole O
thing O
is O
that O
I O
wo O
n't O
let O
them O
stay O
in O
my O
house O
anymore O
. O
Because O
I O
ca O
n't O
have O
that O
twenty O
- O
four O
hour O
bitching O
and O
negative O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
live O
like O
that O
. O

yeah O
. O

yeah O
. O

You O
know O
what O
I O
'm O
saying O
? O

mhm O
. O

It O
's O
just O
twenty B-TIME
- I-TIME
four I-TIME
hours I-TIME
. O

So O
%um O
I O
said O
so O
let O
me O
understand O
this O

so O
you O
're O
coming O
, O

you O
're O
picking O
him O
up O

and O
you O
're O
leaving O
? O

You O
're O
not O
staying O
? O

Right O
. O

And O
I O
go O
%hm O
well O
it O
sounds O
like O
we O
're O
back O
to O
the O
same O
old O
argument O
. O

And O
%um O
I O
said O
so O
you O
're O
going O
to O
punish O
me O
because O
you O
're O
offended O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
particularly O
want O
you O
to O
stay O
here O
in O
my O
home O
. O

Well O
no O
it O
's O
not O
punishing O
. O

I O
said O
well O
then O
what O
do O
you O
call O
it O
. O

I O
mean O
I O
just O
came O
out O
and O
said O
it O
. O

yeah O
. O

No O
you O
just O
do O
n't O
un- O

I O
said O
no O
dad O
. O
I O
think O
it O
's O
you O
do O
n't O
understand O
. O

You O
do O
n't O
understand O
how O
you O
affect O
my O
family O
. O
You O
and O
mom O
. O
and O
more O
importantly O
how O
you O
affect O
me O
. O

And O
he O
said O
that O
's O
your O
problem O
. O

You O
think O
too O
much O
about O
yourself O
. O

And O
I O
said O
goodbye O
dad O
. O

%hm O
. O

And O
I O
hung O
the O
phone O
up O
. O

Good O
for O
you O
. O

why O
does O
our O
life O
have O
to O
be O
like O
this O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
get O
it O
. O

Well O
they O
're O
the O
ones O
who O
created O
it O
. O

They O
're O
n- O

Why O
do O
they O
have O
to O
be O
like O
that O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
know O

and O

Dad O

You O
know O
what O
I O
said O
to O
dad O
%um O
when O
he O
came O
up O
to O
our O
door O
and O
said O
Kara B-PERSON
's O
not O
coming O
cause O
she O
does O
n't O
like O
you O
know O
what O
I O
said O
to O
him O

What O
? O

I O
said O
I O
hope O
that O
my O
sons O
never O
treat O
one O
another O
like O
this O
. O

True O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
my O
kids O
will O
be O
that O
way O
. O

And O
he O
just O
looked O
at O
me O
. O

Well O
you O
've O
got O
a O
point O

but O

So O
tell O
me O
a O
little O
bit O
about O
the O
day O
she O
was O
born O
. O

When O
did O
you O
first O
see O
her O
? O

%um O
what O
happened O
is O
we O
went O
to O
the O
hospital O
, O

she O
was O
induced O
. O

mhm O
. O

So O
we O
get O
a O
phone O
call O

and O
Right O
finally O
. O
%um O
the O
birth O
mom O
was O
supposed O
to O
go O
in O
%um O
, O
it O
's O
my O
thinking O
that O
this O
will O
be O
distributed O
publicly O
. O
Right O
. O
at O
%um O
six B-TIME
thirty I-TIME
in O
the O
morning O

but O
she O
called O

and O
they O
did O
n't O
have O
any O
beds O
. O

oh O
no O
. O

So O
she O
called O
us O
and O
told O
us O
that O
, O

but O
then O
they O
did O
get O
a O
bed O

and O
she O
went O
in O
at O
eight B-TIME
. O
mhm O
. O
Or O
seven B-TIME
thirty I-TIME
or O
, O

I O
guess O
she O
went O
in O
at O
seven B-TIME
thirty I-TIME

and O
they O
started O
her O
at O
eight B-TIME
or O

so O
we O
hopped O
in O
the O
car O
and O
drove O
down O
to O
be O
there O
mhm O
. O
%mm O
mhm O
. O
for O
the O
day O
. O

mhm O
. O

And O
%um O
, O
we O
hung O
out O
all O
day O
. O

%uh O
we O
had O
some O
difficult O
times O
with O
the O
lawyer O
down O
there O
. O

He O
was O
supposed O
to O
show O
up O

%mm O

mhm O
. O

and O
we O
waited O
all O
day O

and O
he O
never O
bloody O
showed O
up O
. O

oh O
no O
. O

and O
also O
she O
was O
expecting O
him O
too O
. O
mhm O
. O
You O
know O

and O
so O
that O
was O
frustrating O
. O

yeah O
. O

But O
anyway O
we O
waited O
all O
day O

%um O
But O
then O
five B-TIME
twenty I-TIME
five I-TIME
Mae B-PERSON
was O
born O
. O

Right O
. O

And O
the O
birth O
mother O
's O
mother O
was O
with O
her O
through O
the O
whole O
thing O

and O
she O
was O
fantastic O
. O

She O
was O
just O
great O
. O

She O
was O
so O
nice O
to O
us O
and O
so O
solid O
there O
for O
her O
daughter O
and O
just O
a O
wonderful O
uh-huh O
. O
mhm O
. O
Woman O
person O

and O
%um O
She O
was O
great O
. O

She O
came O
out O
, O
you O
know O
, O
a O
couple O
times O
during O
the O
day O

she O
came O
out O
and O
gave O
us O
little O
progress O
reports O
of O
how O
things O
were O
going O

and O
actually O
it O
was O
very O
funny O
uh-huh O
. O
because O
the O
first O
time O
she O
out O
, O

I O
mean O
here O
we O
're O
out O
there O
sort O
of O
ringing O
our O
hands O
and O
uh-huh O
. O
sweating O
it O
out O
and O
wondering O
how O
everybody O
is O
going O
and O
everything O

and O
she O
came O
out O

and O
could O
I O
go O
downstairs O
because O
%um O
, O
her O
daughter O
wanted O
playing O
cards O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

So O
I O
guess O
she O
was O
bored O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

You O
know O
passing O
the O
time O

So O
I O
went O
downstairs O
to O
get O
playing O
cards O
with O
her O

uh-huh O
. O
and O
then O
later O
on O
she O
came O
out O

and O
she O
wanted O
some O
chewing O
gum O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

%um O
, O
I O
guess O
your O
mouth O
gets O
dry O

and O
you O
just O
want O
something O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
'm O
sure O
. O

So O
, O
you O
know O
, O
it O
was O
kind O
of O
funny O
these O
very O

Reassuring O
in O
a O
way O
I O
would O
think O
. O

yeah O
, O

but O
these O
very O
%um O
, O

yeah O
. O

you O
know O
they O
're O
such O
sort O
of O
specific O
little O
things O
. O

yeah O
. O

but O
they O
kind O
of O
held O
her O
back O
. O

I O
think O
the O
baby O
would O
've O
been O
born O
sooner O

but O
the O
doctor O
did O
n't O
get O
there O
till O
around B-TIME
three I-TIME
. O

So O

so O
I O
thought O
once O
it O
was O
induced O
there O
was O
like O
no O
stopping O
it O
. O

No O
they O
can O
hold O
you O
back O
%hm O
. O
a O
little O
bit O
, O
you O
know O
. O

%hm O
. O

Once O
, O

depends O
how O
much O
stuff O
they O
give O
you O
. O

How O
much O
stuff O
they O
give O
you O
. O

yeah O
. O

Stuff O
. O

But O
anyway O
I O
think O
they O
were O
holding O
her O
back O
a O
little O
bit O
because O
they O
wanted O
the O
doctor O
there O
. O

mhm O

uh-huh O
. O

%um O
, O
and O
the O
doctor O
showed O
up O
around B-TIME
three I-TIME

and O
Mae B-PERSON
was O
born O
at O
five B-TIME
twenty I-TIME
five I-TIME
. O

mhm O
. O

Eight B-QUANTITY
pounds I-QUANTITY
eight I-QUANTITY
ounces I-QUANTITY
. I-QUANTITY

mhm O
. O

And O
screaming O
. O

mhm O
. O

Really O
screaming O

and O
I O
was O
a O
little O
scared O
. O

I O
thought O
oh O
my O
god O
what O
have O
we O
wrought O
. O

You O
could O
here O
her O
out O
through O
the O
doors O
of O
the O
hall O
, O
you O
know O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

And O
there O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
babies O
being O
born O
. O

You O
did O
n't O
hear O
them O
all O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

And O
I O
, O

and O
%um O
, O
what O
happened O
h- O
, O

I O
guess O
%um O
, O

that O
's O
right O
. O

Her O
mom O
came O
running O
out O
to O
tell O
us O
the O
baby O
was O
born O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

And O
then O
she O
said O
that O
's O
her O
. O

You O
can O
hear O
her O

And O
%um O
, O
said O
it O
was O
a O
beautiful O
birth O
. O

I O
mean O
two B-CARDINAL
pushes O
and O
she O
was O
out O
which O
is O
really O
great O

so O
she O
's O
very O
unsquashed O
and O
unbattered O
looking O
for O
a O
new O
baby O
. O

uh-huh O
mhm O
. O

Right O
. O

Usually O
they O
look O
a O
bit O
bashed O
up O
. O

yeah O
. O

A O
bit O
worn O
. O

But O
she O
's O
got O
a O
nice O
shaped O
head O

and O
, O
you O
know O
she O
does O
n't O
look O
like O
she O
was O
%um O
, O

you O
know O
she O
's O
not O
a O
cone O
head O
. O

mhm O
. O

But O
did O
you O
get O
to O
see O
her O
in O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
hours I-TIME

or O

a- O

Well O
what O
happened O

no O

right O
away O
there O
was O
a O
very O
nice O
%um O
delivery O
nurse O
who O
we O
had O
spoken O
to O
earlier O
in O
the O
day O
named O
Tina B-PERSON
. O

mhm O
. O

mhm O
. O

mhm O
. O

And O
what O
they O
do O
is O
they O
take O
the O
baby O
from O
the O
delivery O
room O
to O
the O
nursery O
. O

mhm O
. O

Normally O
they O
go O
directly O

and O
Tina B-PERSON
very O
, O
very O
sweetly O
zipped O
past O
the O
door O
to O
the O
outer O
part O
of O
the O
nursery O
where O
we O
were O
waiting O
mhm O
. O
mhm O
outside O
mhm O
. O
and O
let O
us O
hold O
her O
. O

mhm O
. O

So O
she O
was O
just O
minutes O
old O
then O
. O

Wow O
. O

So O
we O
held O
her O
for O
just O
a O
couple B-TIME
minutes I-TIME

and O
uh-huh O
. O
it O
was O
really O
funny O
because O
you O
could O
hear O
her O
coming O
up O
the O
hall O
screaming O
uh-huh O
. O
loudly O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

. O

She O
handed O
her O
to O
me O
screaming O
loudly O

and O
I O
said O
to O
Tina B-PERSON
and O
also O
to O
uh-huh O
. O
the O
birth O
mother O
's O
mother O
there O
, O
you O
know O
oh O
Robert B-PERSON
has O
the O
magic O
touch O
. O

I O
handed O
her O
to O
Robert B-PERSON
. O

Instant O
silence O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

Instant O
. O

She O
just O
stopped O
screaming O
immediately O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

So O
he O
held O
her O
for O
a O
little O
while O
. O

And O
then O
the O
nurse O
was O
afraid O
to O
take O
her O
back O
. O

Said O
oh O
she O
's O
going O
to O
scream O
again O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

And O
she O
did O

uh-huh O
. O

And O
off O
they O
went O
to O
the O
nursery O

and O
then O
you O
watched O
through O
the O
glass O

That O
must O
have O
been O
very O
reassuring O
for O
Robert B-PERSON
. O

It O
was O
very O
nice O
was O
n't O
it O
. O

It O
was O
very O
wonderful O
for O
Robert B-PERSON
and O
for O
me O
too O
just O
to O
see O
, O

I O
knew O
it O
would O
work O
too O
. O

Very O
nice O
. O

yeah O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
it O
is O
. O

He O
has O
some O
, O

you O
have O
a O
theory O
. O

Body O
warmth O
or O
something O

but O
anyway O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
think O
it O
's O
partly O
it O

but O
there O
're O
certain O
kind O
of O
men O
who O
, O

I O
think O
it O
's O
men O
who O
have O
like O
these O
big O

I O
have O
this O
theory O
that O
it O
's O
men O
who O
are O
very O
broad O
right O
under O
the O
elbow O
you O
know O
like O
, O

Wait O
a O
minute O
. O

Broad O
under O
the O
elbow O
. O

You O
mean O
in O
the O
chest O
? O

like O

No O
. O

From O
the O
elbow O
down O
towards O
the O
wrist O
. O

oh O
. O

Who O
have O
like O
these O
big O
broad O
forearms O
. O

I O
think O
babies O
like O
that O
. O

You O
think O
it O
gives O
security O
. O

I O
suppose O
. O

Do O
you O
remember O
Otto B-PERSON
who O
moved O
my O
filing O
cabinet O
that O
time O
in O
Philadelphia B-GPE

he O
's O
another O
one O
? O
Yes O
. O
uh-huh O
. O
uh-huh O
. O
yeah O
. O
He O
's O
big O
. O
He O
's O
sort O
of O
solid O
to O
me O
. O
who O

He O
's O
sort O
of O
very O
solid O

and O
they O
just O
love O
it O
. O

But O
Robert B-PERSON
's O
not O
big O
like O
that O
. O

No O
, O

but O
Robert B-PERSON
is O
big O
below O
the O
elbows O
I O
'll O
bet O
if O
you O
check O
. O

I O
'll O
have O
to O
check O
out O
below O
Robert B-PERSON
's O
elbows O

At O
any O
rate O
, O
%um O

So O
that O
was O
nice O

and O
then O
we O
watched O
through O
the O
nursery O
while O
they O
do O
, O

if O
you O
survive O
the O
first O
four O
hours O
of O
life O
in O
the O
nursery O
you O
'll O
survive O
anything O
after O
. O

It O
's O
the O
most O
sort O
of O
appalling O
introduction O
to O
life O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

But O
I O
was O
kind O
of O
scared O
at O
that O
point O
because O
we O
're O
looking O
in O
and O
there O
're O
all O
these O
nice O
sweet O
little O
pale O
babies O
lying O
there O
limp O

uh-huh O
. O

and O
there O
's O
Mae B-PERSON

and O
she O
's O
big O
compared O
to O
the O
rest O

and O
she O
was O
bright O
red O

and O
she O
is O
screaming O

and O
she O
screamed O

and O
she O
screamed O

and O
she O
screamed O

and O
all O
the O
rest O
of O
them O
as O
soon O
as O
they O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

Um O
- O
huh O

uh-huh O

they O
sort O
of O
get O
exhausted O
after O
two B-CARDINAL
screams O
and O
collapse O
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
she O
was O
healthy O
I O
guess O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

And O
she O
just O
screamed O
and O
screamed O
and O
screamed O
and O
screamed O
and O
screamed O

and O
I O
thought O
oh O
my O
god O
what O
have O
we O
wrought O
here O
. O

Did O
they O
tell O
you O
her O
apgar O
or O
whatever O
they O
call O
that O
? O

How O

They O
did O
n't O
tell O
us O
anything O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
at O
the O
hospital O
the O
individual O
people O
we O
had O
contact O
with O
were O
decent O
to O
us O
and O
friendly O

Were O
nice O
. O

but O
%um O
the O
hospital O
policy O
was O
rather O
unfriendly O
to O
us O

and O
they O
would O
n't O
, O

like O
we O
had O
been O
told O
, O

they O
have O
a O
room O
called O
the O
bonding O
room O

yeah O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

and O
the O
whole O
purpose O
of O
the O
room O
is O
to O
let O
people O
be O
in O
it O
with O
the O
baby O
, O
who O
-- O
uh-huh O
. O
-- O
are O
going O
to O
be O
with O
the O
baby O
. O

Right O
. O

And O
they O
would O
n't O
let O
us O
in O
there O

so O
, O
%mm O
. O
it O
was O
really O
quite O
awful O
. O

They O
would O
n't O
let O
us O
, O

they O
did O
n't O
, O

they O
gave O
us O

but O
they O
did O
n't O
tell O
us O
beans O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
mean O
they O
really O
did O
n't O
talk O
to O
us O
. O

They O
did O
n't O
offer O
us O
that O
parenting O
class O
that O
they O
offer O
to O
most O
people O
. O

mhm O
. O

We O
would O
have O
had O
to O
come O
back O
the O
next O
day O
to O
the O
hospital O
which O
of O
course O
we O
were O
n't O
going O
to O
do O
. O

%hm O
. O

mhm O
. O

%um O
, O
you O
know O
they O
really O
were O
n't O
very O
nice O

and O
yeah O
. O
I O
guess O
they O
have O
, O

their O
rules O
are O
just O
very O
rigid O
. O

%mm O
. O

And O
the O
problem O
is O
the O
lawyer O
was O
supposed O
to O
have O
arranged O
for O
%um O
Right O
. O
an O
additional O
bracelet O
. O

mhm O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
what O
happens O
is O
they O
put O
one B-CARDINAL
on O
the O
wrist O
of O
the O
baby O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
on O
the O
ankle O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
on O
the O
birth O
mother O

and O
then O
she O
has O
what O
you O
call O
the O
fourth B-ORDINAL
bracelet O
which O
she O
can O
give O
to O
whoever O
will O
be O
her O
coach O
through O
the O
birth O
and O
stuff O

and O
of O
course O
she O
had O
given O
it O
to O
her O
mother O
, O
%hm O
. O
mhm O
. O
%hm O
. O
I O
see O
. O
I O
see O
. O
which O
makes O
perfect O
sense O
. O

mhm O
. O

Well O
, O
the O
only O
way O
, O

they O
could O
n't O
get O
their O
minds O
around O
the O
notion O
of O
a O
fifth B-ORDINAL
bracelet O
for O
us O
. O

Right O
. O

So O
the O
only O
way O
that O
they O
would O
have O
let O
us O
in O
there O
was O
to O
take O
her O
mothers O
away O
, O
Right O
. O
which O
we O
would O
n't O
ask O
and O
which O
she O
would O
n't O
do O
. O

Right O
. O

Right O
. O

And O
%um O
the O
lawyer O
had O
told O
us O
he O
had O
arranged O
everything O
ahead O
of O
time O

and O
there O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
I O
D O
there O
at O
the O
hospital O
for O
us O

and O
it O
was O
all O
set O

and O
of O
course O
he O
had O
n't O
done O
anything O
. O

I O
see O
. O

He O
had O
n't O
done O
that O
, O
%hm O
. O

No O
. O

He O
had O
n't O
done O
anything O
. O

He O
's O
been O
just O
hopeless O
. O

%hm O
. O

I O
mean O
I O
think O
legally O
he O
's O
not O
hopeless O
. O

I O
think O
he O
's O
done O
all O
the O
necessary O
legal O
things O

but O
%um O
yeah O
. O
you O
know O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
things O
, O

He O
's O
an O
S O
O O
B O

forgive O
me O
tape O
whoever O
you O
are O

but O
he O
was O
a O
fucker O
. O

yeah O
. O

No O
. O

th- O

And O
%um O
I O
'm O
sorry O

but O
he O
was O
. O

I O
think O
they O
said O
published O
actually O
. O

oh O
well O
they O
can O
edit O
that O
word O
I O
guess O

Anyway O
it O
's O
English B-LANGUAGE

so O

yeah O
. O

It O
's O
American B-NORP
English B-LANGUAGE
. O

%um O

You O
know O
he O
said O
things O
to O
me O
like O
well O
you O
'll O
have O
her O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
your O
life O
, O
you O
know O
. O
yeah O
. O
Do O
n't O
worry O
about O
it O
, O
which O
is O
really O
an O
arrogant O
attitude O
to O
take O
, O
you O
know O
. O

yeah O

yeah O

Man O
. O

yeah O
. O

he O
was O
a O
real O
arrogant O
S O
O O
B O
, O

so O

How O
old O
was O
he O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
know O

we O
never O
met O
him O
. O

He O
never O
showed O
up O
. O

oh O
. O

he O
ended O
up O

in O
the O
end O
, O
he O
sent O
his O
partner O
to O
actually O
sign O
the O
papers O
who O
's O
not O
even O
an O
adoption O
attorney O
. O

mhm O

He O
does O
litigation O

Does O

what O
he O
's O
doing O

but O

hope O
he O
did O
what O
his O
partner O
told O
him O
to O
do O
. O

mhm O
. O

%mm O

mhm O
. O

But O
he O
at O
least O
was O
a O
sensitive O
human O
being O
. O

mhm O
. O

%um O
, O
you O
know O
so O
that O
was O
nice O
. O

He O
had O
some O
sensitivity O
. O

We O
're O
going O
to O
get O
cut O
off O
soon O
. O

oh O
no O

And O
I O
want O
to O

. O

No O

I O
'm O
not O

'm O
feeling O
like O
oh O

should O
all O
of O
this O
be O
in O
the O
public O
record O
or O
something O
. O

oh O
yes O
. O

Well O
they O
just O
beeped O

think O
that O
might O
mean O
we O
have O
to O
hang O
up O
. O

okay O
. O

We O
have O
a O
minute O
. O

%um O
. O

I O
want O
to O
tell O
you O
I O
saw O
four O
parakeets O
fly O
across O
the O
street O
in O
Barcelona B-GPE
. O

oh O
neat O
. O

Is O
it O
thirty B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
? O

It O
was O
beautiful O
. O

Is O
it O

It O
's O
going O
to O
be O
thirty B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
in O
about B-TIME
five I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
I O
think O
. O

oh O
okay O

because O
there O
's O
a O
beep O
coming O
on O
my O
end O
. O

yeah O
. O

You O
do O
n't O
hear O
it O
? O

No O
. O

okay O
. O

Well O
ignore O
it O

so O
we O
'll O
let O
them O
go O
on O
. O

Well O
anyway O
. O

oh O
so O
that O
sounds O
very O
nice O
. O

They O
were O
loose O
or O
in O
a O

Well O
they O
were O
loose O

they O
were O

I O
said O
the O
Sheila B-PERSON
I O
think O
I O
hear O
a O
parakeet O
. O

uh-huh O

And O
you O
could O
tell O
he O
thought O
that O
it O
was O
nonsense O
that O
it O
was O
a O
uh-huh O
crow O

and O
then O
I O
saw O
it O

but O
the O
sun O
was O
against O
my O
eyes O

oh O
how O
neat O

so O
I O
could O
n't O
tell O

and O
then O
it O
flew O

and O
when O
it O
flew O
three O
more O
of O
them O
flew O
out O
of O
the O
same O
tree O
. O

oh O
how O
neat O
. O

They O
were O
beautiful O
. O
there O
was O
a O
street O
I O
walked O
down O
in O
Barcelona B-GPE
big O
wide O

with O
all O
the O
bird O
sellers O

Yes O
. O

They O
were O
closed O
up O
that O
day O

but O
I O
'm O
sure O
that O
what O
these O
were O
is O
Well O
it O
was O
a O
wonderful O
place O
I O
mean O
I O
guess O
you O
have O
to O
sort O
of O
discount O
that O
they O
're O
in O
cages O
but O
Escapees O

yeah O

yeah O

it O
's O
part O
of O

it O
was O
beautiful O

yeah O
. O

I O
mean O
it O
was O
just O
so O
beautiful O
with O
all O
these O
amazing O
yeah O
. O
birds O
and O
colors O
. O

And O
also O
in O
parts O
of O
Spain B-GPE
, O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
they O
have O
this O
in O
parts O
of O
France B-GPE
, O

but O
Probably O
not O

I O
saw O
parts O
of O
Spain B-GPE
where O
they O
had O
birds O
on O
the O
shutters O
and O
they O
put O
them O
out O
during O
the O
day O
. O

It O
's O
very O
popular O
in O
Spain B-GPE

but O
it O
's O
not O
so O
popular O
here O
in O
France B-GPE
. O

yeah O
. O

It O
was O
a O
nice O
thing O
. O

yeah O
. O

%um O
I O
've O
seen O
very O
little O
of O
it O
. O

yeah O
. O

y- O

I O
had O
friends O
in O
Madrid B-GPE
whose O
father O
bred O
birds O
actually O
. O

oh O
really O
? O

In O
their O
apartment O
. O

yeah O
. O

It O
's O
quite O
a O
big O
hobby O
. O

Parakeets O
or O
? O

No O
little O
tiny O
birds O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
they O
were O
. O

Little O

Finches O
maybe O
. O

yeah O
. O

Song O
birds O
of O
some O
kind O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

oh O
neat O
. O

And O
he O
was O
good O
at O
breeding O
them O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

so O

oh O
well O
that O
's O
good O

So O

but O
when O
you O
went O
up O
to O
Connecticut B-GPE
, O
all O
was O
well O
? O

Or O
was O
that O
another O
adventure O
? O

up O
to O
Connecticut B-GPE
? O

Did O
I O
go O
to O

Then O
you O
had O
to O
go O
up O
and O
get O
Jack B-PERSON
and O
everything O
after O

oh O
yeah O

it O
's O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
still O

but O
. O

oh O
. O

%um O
yeah O

we O
got O
up O
. O

We O
got O
Jack B-PERSON
. O

We O
went O
to O
our O
lawyer O
who O
's O
been O
mhm O
. O
Absolutely O
fantastic O
start O
to O
finish O
. O

I O
think O
she O
's O
great O
. O

mhm O
. O
mhm O
. O

%um O
and O
then O
came O
home O

and O
yeah O
then O
Robert B-PERSON
's O
mom O
crashed O
the O
car O
. O

oh O
I O
see O

it O
was O
after O
that O
that O
she O
did O
that O
. O

So O
yeah O

actually O
we O
had O
to O
do O
that O
at O
like O
eight O
o'clock O
the O
next O
morning O
because O
Martha B-PERSON
was O
leaving O
by O
nine B-TIME
. O

So O
mom O
and O
dad O
were O
down O
there O
for O
how O
long O
? O

They O
came O
Saturday B-DATE
and O
stayed O
Saturday B-DATE
night O
and O
Sunday B-DATE
and O
left O
Monday B-DATE

uh-huh O
. O

This O
past O
Monday B-DATE
like O

he O
did O
n't O
command O
the O
legs O
, O
%huh O
? O

mhm O

sometimes O
not O
as O
much O
as O
he O
would O
like O
to O
be O
, O

but O
he O
's O
doing O
really O
good O
. O

and O
Now O
I O
think O
that O
he O
's O
got O
kind O
of O
control O

uh-huh O

he O
's O
much O
sweeter O

uh-huh O

188.81_192.55_B: O
yeah O
, O

he O
seems O
to O
have O
a O
, O

well O
I O
mean O
he O
was O
sweet O
before O
, O

but O

well O
, O
it O
's O
a O
frustrating O
process O
to O
be O
always O
falling O
down O
, O
%huh O
? O

yeah O
, O

and O
now O
he O
's O
usually O
better O
, O

now O
he O
's O
pretty O
fussy O

but O
oi O

yeah O

so O
, O
how O
have O
you O
been O
? O

work O
and O
Elizabeth B-PERSON
? O

and O

yeah O
, O

that O
was O
a O
hard O
trip O

%uh O
, O
she O
's O
not O
at O
all O
well O
, O
matter O
of O
fact O

I O
would O
n't O
be O
surprised O
to O
get O
a O
phone O
call O
anytime O
. O

oh O
, O
really O
? O

yeah O
, O

she O
was O
wanting O
to O
die O
while O
we O
were O
there O
. O

really O
. O

yeah O
, O

she O
's O
had O
her O
fourth O
stroke O

and O
oh O
gosh O
. O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
pain O
on O
her O
left O
side O
, O

and O
she O
ca O
n't O
walk O
without O
a O
walker O
, O

and O
she O
ca O
n't O
go O
but O
a O
few O
steps O
, O

and O
%mm O
so O
she O
lives O
in O
a O
chair O
and O
on O
couch O
and O
back O
in O
her O
hospital O
bed O
, O
right O
there O
within O
a O
few O
feet O
of O
each O
other O
. O

%mm O

and O
she O
's O
so O
used O
to O
being O
, O
you O
know O
up O
and O
busy O
, O
and O
in O
control O
, O
and O
able O
to O
do O
and O

and O
she O
ca O
n't O

finishing O
her O
autobiography O
and O
then O
%uh O
wanting O
to O
die O
, O
but O
not O
lifting O

yeah O
. O

but O
her O
mother O

waiting O

Wait O
a O
second O
, O

what O
's O
going O
on O
? O

well O
I O
'm O
a O
Finnish B-NORP
T O
V O
star O
. O

374.10_374.55_A: O
are O
you O
? O

yeah O
, O

you O
were O
on O
T O
V O
? O

well O

Thursday I-DATE
. O

Alexia B-PERSON
are O
you O
okay O
? O

and O
, O
%um O
, O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
a O
cultural O
show O
, O
%um O

uh-huh O
, O
inter O
-- O
to O
-- O
view O
the O
Americans B-NORP
? O

yeah O
, O

and O
we O
do O
like O
little O
skits O
on O
like O
how O
%um O
, O
Americans B-NORP
react O
to O
things O
differently O
than O
other O
cultures O
, O
and O
oh O
, O
neat O
Finnish B-NORP
culture O
, O

so O
we O
like O
do O
the O
subway O
scene O
of O
Americans B-NORP
in O
the O
subway O
, O
and O
Finns B-NORP
in O
the O
subway O
. O

they O
're O
pretty O
funny O

I O
'll O
bet O
that O
was O
fun O
, O
%huh O
? O

yeah O
, O

I O
think O
it O
'll O
be O
pretty O
interesting O

it O
does O
n't O
%um O
air O
until O
January B-DATE
fifteenth I-DATE
, O

but O
it O
's O
pretty O
fun O
I O
think O
, O
because O
they O
had O
French B-NORP
, O
and O
German B-NORP
, O
and O
Asian B-NORP
, O
and O

I O
'll O
be O
interested O
to O
see O
how O
they O
put O
it O
all O
together O
. O

yeah O

%um O
, O
yeah O
, O

see O
how O
it O
ends O
up O
, O

so O

, O
so O
will O
it O
be O
in O
Finnish B-LANGUAGE
, O

or O

no O
. O

well O
we O
spoke O
in O
English B-LANGUAGE
, O

but O
it O
's O
like O
a O
Finnish B-NORP
documentary O
. O

it O
's O
a O
Finnish B-NORP
documentary O

but O
it O
has O
all O
these O
sections O
to O
it O
? O

yeah O

yeah O
, O

neat O

yeah O
, O

like O
different O
parts O
of O
movies O
and O
stuff O
, O

so O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
see O
if O
I O
can O
get O
my O
American B-NORP
friend O
to O
tape O
it O
. O

neat O
. O

Yammi B-PERSON

saving O
up O
for O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
those O
V O
C O
R's O

so O
maybe O
by O
then O
we O
'll O
have O
one O
, O

we O
can O
tape O
it O

and O
yes O
it O
seems O
interesting O
what O
they O
're O
doing O
, O

so O

yeah O
, O

so O
it O
'll O
be O
a O
cross O
culture O
center O
%huh O
? O

yeah O
, O

and O
they O
're O
paying O
me O

so O

? O

yeah O
, O

I O
thought O
it O
's O
pretty O

I O
guess O

, O
not O

's O
what O
we O

Lloyd I-PERSON
Wright I-PERSON

, O

I O

a O
masters' O
program O
here O
yeah O
in O
, O

and O
they O
cost O
seventy B-MONEY
thousand I-MONEY
marks I-MONEY
a O

twenty B-CARDINAL
four I-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
or O
something O
? O

you O
're O
kidding O
. O

no O
. O

I O
thought O
, O
whoa O
. O

that O
's O
pretty O
steep O
considering O
all O
the O
other O
education O
's O
free O
here O
, O

yeah O
. O

yeah O
, O

so O
what O
's O
the O
deal O
? O

well O
, O
it O
's O
especially O
for O
-- O

private O
school O

well O
no O
, O

but O
, O
they O
, O
do O
n't O
have O
masters O
program O

does O
kind O
of O
, O

it O
's O
new O
, O
starting O
out O
this O
year O

and O
it O
's O
%um O
designed O
to O
fit O
the O
States O
' O
idea O
of O
undergrad O
and O
masters O
program O
, O
you O
know O

%uh O

so O
, O
I O
'm O
going O
to O

about O
trying O
to O
just O
get O

the O
regular O
school O
, O
and O
trying O
to O
continue O
like O
maybe O
next B-DATE
year I-DATE
or O

being O
a O
Finnish B-NORP
citizen O
, O
or O
being O
married O
to O
a O
Finnish B-NORP
citizen O
does O
n't O
help O
you O
in O
that O
way O
, O

that O

well O
not O
for O
that O
masters O
program O
it O
does O
n't O

but O
for O
just O
going O
, O
if O
I O
wanted O
just O
to O
take O
classes O
to O
receive O
a O
Finnish B-NORP
degree O
, O
which O
is O
equivalent O
to O
a O

's O
four B-CARDINAL
six B-CARDINAL
two B-CARDINAL
two B-CARDINAL
six B-CARDINAL
is O
n't O
it O
? O

two B-CARDINAL
two B-CARDINAL
six B-CARDINAL

six B-CARDINAL

okay O
, O
thanks O
. O

Because O
we O
had O
it O
all O
ready O
, O
and O
then O
went O
to O
look O
, O

and O
I O
was O
like O
I O
have O
their O
phone O
number O
, O

and O
that O
's O
it O
. O

so O

I O
bought O
you O
a O
little O
coffee O
cup O
from O
Tullyesa B-ORG

and O
I O
still O
hav O
n't O
gotten O
it O
in O
the O
mail O
, O

so O

About O
the O
fall O
one O
you O
mean O
? O

yeah O
. O

yeah O
. O

trying O
to O
figure O
out O

Well O
, O
I O
told O
him O
too O
that O
I O
'll O
mention O
to O
him O
again O
on O
Monday B-DATE

but O
, O
well O
of O
coarse O
Mister O
Oharshi B-PERSON
is O
not O
always O
prompt O
in O
his O
answer O
either O

but O
maybe O
Mister O
Furobiashi B-PERSON
too O
will O

Well O
, O
I O
was O
just O
wondering O
should O
I O
just O
pick O
a O
date O
and O
say O
I O
'm O
coming O
. O

yeah O
, O

because O
I O
think O
, O
you O
know O
, O
at O
first O
we O
were O
talking O
about O
that O
trying O
to O
work O
it O
in O
with O
the O
festival O

but O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
good O
because O
of O
the O
fact O
Right O
that O
we O
foreign O
teachers O
many O
of O
us O
want O
to O
go O
down O
to O
that O
Sure O
which O
is O
right O
after O
you O
know O
which O
we O
'll O
leave O
like O
on O
the B-DATE
Friday I-DATE
night I-DATE
%uh O
, O
the B-DATE
third I-DATE
and O
then O
be O
down O
for O
the B-DATE
fourth I-DATE
and I-DATE
fifth I-DATE
. O

mhm O
. O

so O
I O
think O
probably O
just O
work O
it O
in O
to O
your O
general O
scheduling O
you O
know O
like O
you O
've O
done O
before O
and O
not O
bother O
hit O
it O
on O
that O
weekend O
. O

We- O
, O

yeah O
. O

okay O
. O

Well O
I O
'm O
, O
%um O
, O

what O
I O
was O
trying O
to O
figure O
I O
asked O
some O
of O
the O
students O
here O
whether O
they O
thought O
it O
was O
better O
to O
be O
there O
before O
or O
after O
the O
fall O
festival O

and O
they O
said O
after O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

Do O
you O
agree O
? O

Yes O
. O

Well O
, O
mainly O
because O
there O
are O
, O

especially O
if O
it O
's O
just O
the B-DATE
few I-DATE
days I-DATE
before I-DATE
, O

that O
's O
when O
the O
students O
finally O
get O
down O
to O
preparing O
for O
the O
festival O

and O
so O
those B-DATE
days I-DATE
are O
really O
yeah O
. O
pretty O
busy O
. O

And O
so O
after O
the O
festival O
%uh O
, O
they O
're O
a O
lot O
freer O

so O
if O
you O
could O
make O
it O
after O
that O
weekend O
. O

What O
about O
, O
just O
, O

I O
'm O
looking O
at O
the O
calendar O
trying O
to O
figure O
, O

what O
about O
, O
say O
on O
November B-DATE

say O
if O
I O
either O
come O
in O
on O
the B-DATE
ninth I-DATE
or O
you O
know O
the B-TIME
evening I-TIME
of I-TIME

last O
place O

days I-DATE
might O
be O
like O
? O

days B-DATE
? O

Eighth B-DATE
, O
or O
eighth B-DATE
and I-DATE
ninth I-DATE
? O

or O

%uh O
, O
ninth B-DATE

just O
that O
there O
are O
no O

second B-ORDINAL
period O

the O
students O
have O
this O
special O
chapel O

but O
you O

would O
be O
fine O
. O

I O
'd O
like O
to O
meet O
with O
the O
parents O
again O
, O

that O
seemed O
to O
be O
so O
well O
received O
, O
%uh O

mhm O
. O

%um O
, O

the O
beginning O
of O
a O
much O
bigger O
-- O
you O
would O

You O

n't O
start O
until O
five B-TIME
ten I-TIME
. O

oh O
, O
okay O
. O

Five B-TIME
ten I-TIME

So O
it O
would O
be O
better O
to O
come O

, O
like O
the B-TIME
morning I-TIME
of I-TIME
the I-TIME
ninth I-TIME
or O
like O

trying O
to O
put O
this O
together O

but O
I O
did O
n't O
know O
how O
to O
organize O
it O
. O

I O
really O
wanted O

J O

J O
C O

been O
the O
kingpin O

%uh O
, O
group O
. O

Now O
Mister O
Furobiashi B-PERSON
the O
last O
time O
I O
did O
hear O
from O
t- O
, O

or O
, O
no O
I O
guess O
it O
was O
a O
graduate O
that O
was O
just O
over O
there O
and O
came O
back O

and O
she O
said O
when O
she O
talked O
to O
him O
that O
he O
indicated O
there O
were O
not O
many O
%um O
interested O
in O
studying O
in O
the B-GPE
U I-GPE
S I-GPE
because O
they O
were O
a O
not O
very O
motivated O
group O
. O

yeah O
. O

the O
present O
check O
at O
your O
students O
, O

yeah O

Now O

the O
first B-ORDINAL
year O
bunch O
are O
different O

I O
mean O
oh O
they O
seemed O
to O
be O
more O
motivated O

so O
it O
's O
true O
that O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
how O
many O
there O
will O
be O
in O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
although O
there O
are O
two B-CARDINAL
second B-ORDINAL
year O

She O

minimal O

mhm O
. O

He O
's O
doing O
the O
minimal O

But O

another O
Japanese B-NORP
girl O
in O
his O

who O

very O
poor O

uh-huh O

and O
%uh O
Hiroki B-PERSON
has O
appointed O
himself O
as O

protector O

oh O
dear O

and O
consequently O
she O
's O
failing O

%mm O

and O
by O
her O
testing O
she O
should O
be O
the O
top O
student O
in O
the O

oh O

she O
could O
be O
easily O

but O
she O
you O
know O

puts O
on O

drag O
outs O
with O
her O
. O

%mm O

She O
's O
just O
really O
immature O
the O
other O
Japanese B-NORP
girls O
say O
, O

oh O
, O
she O
's O
just O

you O
know O
, O
it O
's O
immaturity O
. O

mhm O
. O

But O
, O
%uh O
, O
because O
he O
just O
identifies O
with O
her O
mhm O
. O
you O
know O
he O
is O
not O
performing O
to O
where O
he O
could O
perform O
or O
should O
perform O
. O

mhm O
. O

And O
so O
when O

's O
not O
around O
he O
does O
better O
%uh O
you O
know O
, O
not O
great O
but O

got O
to O
be O

%uh O
in O
January B-DATE
with O
the O
baby O
to O
%uh O
-- O
-- O

%uh O
-- O
-- O
the O

it O
'll O
come O
out O
to O
see O
the O
relatives O
. O

Show O
off O
le O
bebe O
. O

yeah O
. O

Show O
off O
le O
bebe O
. O

Excellent O

Do O
you O
think O
ei- O

I O
mean O
eight B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
is O
not O
really O

well O
it O
'll O
be O
older O
than O
eight B-DATE
weeks I-DATE

it O
'll O
be O
like O
ten B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
by O
then O
. O

That O
's O
not O
too O
early O
to O
travel O
is O
it O
? O

Nope O
. O

I O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
like O
much O
easier O
to O
travel O
if O
we O
went O
when O
he O
was O
ten B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
than O
-- O
yep O
, O
yep O
, O
yep O
. O
-- O
you O
know O
after O
that O
. O

when O
they O
're O
new O
infants O
it O
's O
like O
bring O
along O
a O
blanket O
so O
you O
can O
nurse O
them O
. O

And O
like O
you O
could O
do O
anything O
. O

You O
could O
probably O
go O
like O
do O
skydiving O
or O
something O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
know O
. O

And O
if O
you O
were O
nursing O
the O
baby O
while O
you O
were O
skydiving O
the O
baby O
would O
be O
like O
okay O
. O

yeah O
. O

Alright O
. O

As O
long O
as O
we O
're O
nursing O
while O
we O
're O
doing O
this O
that O
's O
okay O
. O

That O
's O
what O
I O
thought O
too O
. O

And O
they O
do O
n't O
need O
that O
many O
clothes O
when O
they O
're O
that O
young O
. O

And O
they O
do O
n't O
need O
toys O
. O

So O
. O

You O
know O
basically O
you O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
bring O
anything O
. O
%uh O
but O
you O
know O
your O
two B-CARDINAL
boobs O
. O

%uh O
And O
since O
I O
ca O
n't O
really O
go O
anywhere O
without O
those O
anyhow O

They O
're O
hard O
to O
forget O

yeah O
. O

Hard O
to O
leave O
behind O
. O

yeah O
. O

So O
I O
mean O
you O
know O
then O
we O
can O
just O
use O
disposables O
if O
we O
're O
travelling O
, O

so O

oh O
definitely O
. O

Do O
n't O

we O
did O

one B-CARDINAL
time O
like O
we O
were O
travelling O
in O
the O
car O

we O
were O
like O
oh O
we O
can O
just O
bring O
a O
little O
mini O
diaper O
pail O
and O
all O
. O

yeah O
. O

That O
was O
after O
one B-CARDINAL
time O

I O
went O
never O
again O
. O

Disposables O
for O
travelling O
. O

And O
%um O
Absolutely O
. O
Every O
now O
did O
you O
supplement O
nursing O
with O
bottles O
at O
all O
or O
did O
n't O
you O
? O

No O
. O

No O
. O

Somehow O
like O
I O
read O
too O
many O
of O
the O
books O

so O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
like O
no O
formula O
. O

It O
does O
make O
a O
difference O

like O
I O
always O
thought O
formula O
smells O
kind O
of O
disgusting O

oh O
yeah O
. O

Like O
when O
they O
throw O
up O
it O
smells O
disgusting O

and O
when O
they O
make O
their O
little O
doo O
- O
doo's O
it O
smells O
grosser O
if O
they O
're O
on O
formula O
. O

now O
you O
'll O
find O
this O
hard O
this O
believe O
but O
if O
they O
're O
totally O
breast O
milk O
for O
like O
the O
first O
couple O
months O
-- O
mhm O
. O
their O
number O
twos O
do O
n't O
smell O
at O
all O
. O

oh O
okay O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
smell O
like O
anything O
. O

It O
's O
like O
it O
looks O
like O
shit O
but O
it O
does O
n't O
smell O
like O
anything O
. O

oh O
okay O
. O

And O
did O
you O
pump O
or O
not O
? O

yeah O
I O
pumped O
. O

What O
joy O
that O
was O
. O

Did O
you O
use O
a O
manual O
or O
%uh O
did O
you O
get O
one O
of O
those O
little O
battery O
ones O
? O

Battery O
operated O
deal O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
think O
so O
too O
. O

Now O
like O
I O
can O
tell O
you O

I O
can O
find O
the O
exact O
brand O
name O
of O
it O
if O
you O
want O
some O
time O
. O

But O
like O
it O
had O
like O
this O
little O
like O
nozzle O
attachment O
thing O
on O
it O
which O
was O
what O
it O
said O
you O
were O
supposed O
to O
use O
. O

mhm O
. O

mhm O
. O

And O
I O
used O
it O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
for O
like O
three B-TIME
seconds I-TIME

I O
was O
like O
-- O
-- O
%ah O
get O
this O
thing O
off O
me O
. O

That O
really O
hurt O
. O

Do O
n't O
ever O
do O
that O
again O
. O

And O
I O
forget O
what O
it O
said O
it O
was O
for O

I O
think O
it O
said O
it O
was O
for O
if O
you O
had O
small O
breasts O
or O
something O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O

oh O
okay O
. O

so O
like O
I O
took O
that O
thing O

and O
I O
threw O
it O
away O
. O

It O
was O
like O
a O
little O
part O
you O
put O
on O
top O
of O
a O
nozzle O
thing O
. O

It O
was O
just O
like O
an O
extra O
attachment O

and O
I O
took O
that O

and O
I O
-- O
mhm O
okay O
. O
-- O
threw O
it O
away O

okay O
. O

And O
then O
it O
was O
fine O
. O

okay O
. O

So O
. O

yeah O
. O

That O
seemed O
to O
work O
fine O

ye- O

You O
know O
if O
you O
could O
avoid O
it O
you O
know O
if O
it O
was O
a O
choice O
in O
your O
life O
to O
say O
well O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
couple O
months O
I O
'll O
just O
be O
home O

and O
I O
'll O
just O
get O
a O
lot O
of O
rest O

and O
I O
'll O
take O
it O
easy O

and O
if O
I O
'm O
not O
-- O
-- O
sleeping O
at O
night O
I O
'll O
just O
sleep O
during O
the O
day O
or O
sleep O
when O
the O
baby O
sleeps O
. O

yeah O
. O

Not O
do O
this O
whole O
pumping O
thing O

I O
mean O
if O
I O
had O
to O
do O
it O
all O
over O
that O
's O
what O
I O
would O
do O
. O

oh O
yeah O

because O
I O
was O
thinking O
it O
would O
be O
easier O
because O
then O
other O
people O
could O
feed O
the O
baby O
and O
you O
would O
n't O
have O
to O
be O
so O
tied O
to O
it O
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
if O
you O
want O
to O
go O
out O
to O
a O
movie O
or O
something O
. O

Mean O
that O
you O
know O
did O
you O

Well O
we O
never O
go O
out O
. O

I O
mean O
you O
know O
what O
Norm B-PERSON
and O
I O
are O
like O

I O
mean O
. O

Well O
believe O
me O

when O
you O
have O
a O
baby O
you O
'll O
want O
, O
to O
put O
it O
in O
someone O
else O
's O
house O
or O
someone O
come O
watch O
it O
in O
your O
house O
and O
go O
anywhere O
else O
. O

See O
that O
's O
what O
I O
was O
thinking O
like O
for O
my O
in O
laws O
and O
stuff O
when O
we O
go O
home O
for O
Christmas B-DATE
. O

mhm O
. O

It O
would O
be O
so O
nice O
to O
just O
you O
know O
leave O
the O
baby O
with O
them O

but O
you O
ca O
n't O
leave O
the O
baby O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
mean O
you O
know O
you O
might O
have O
to O
try O
one B-CARDINAL
or O
two B-CARDINAL
before O
you O
find O
one B-CARDINAL
that O
works O

but O
yeah O
. O
once O

and O
you O
know O
they O
have O
like O
things O
and O
like O
can O
set O
the O
tension O
or O
whatever O

they O
get O
suck O
power O
. O

the O
tension O

they O
're O
like O
the O
little O
knob O
on O
your O
sewing O
machine O
. O

You O
can O
set O
the O
power O
level O
and O
stuff O

and O
it O
g- O

Or O
like O
extra O
suck O
for O
just O
starting O
to O
suck O
. O

You O
know O
it O
's O
like O
once O
you O
get O
used O
it O
i- O

you O
know O
at O
first O
you O
feel O
like O
what O
am O
I O
doing O
putting O
this O
machine O
on O
me O

it O
's O
disgusting O
or O
obscene O
or O
something O
. O

But O
once O
you O
get O
used O
to O
it O
%uh O
you O
know O
you O
can O
like O
read O
while O
you O
're O
doing O
it O
. O

It O
was O
like O
boring O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

okay O
. O

And O
what O
does O
it O
go O
into O

like O
a O
little O
plastic O
bag O
**thingy** O
? O

%uh O
well O
the O
thing O
I O
had O
was O
-- O
-- O
like O
you O
screwed O
on O
this O
whole O
motor O
suction O
part O
-- O
uh-huh O
. O
-- O
on O
to O
something O
that O
was O
just O
like O
a O
jar O
bottom O
. O

You O
know O
just O
looked O
like O
a O
screw O
thing O
so O
that O
it O
went O
to O
this O
plastic O
container O
. O

okay O
. O

And O
you O
can O
reuse O
the O
plastic O
container O
? O

And O
then O
what O
I O
would O
do O
is O
just O
%uh O
I O
would O
bring O
little O
bags O
like O
that O
you O
're O
supposed O
to O
put O
formula O
in O
with O
me O
to O
work O
. O

oh O
okay O
. O

And O
then O
I O
'd O
pour O
it O
from O
the O
container O
into O
the O
plastic O
bag O
and O
seal O
it O
up O
and O
then O
go O
you O
know O
rinse O
out O
the O
container O
thing O
and O
wash O
it O
the O
next O
day O
. O

And O
did O
you O
throw O
away O
the O
plastic O
bags O
when O
you O
were O
done O
? O

Well O
see O
then O
the O
plastic O
bag O
is O
designed O
to O
go O
inside O
a O
bottle O
thing O
. O

yeah O
. O

so O
you O
throw O
the O
plastic O
bag O
away O
when O
you O
're O
done O
. O

After O
your O
baby O
drinks O
the O
milk O
yeah O
. O

yeah O

okay O

okay O
. O

I O
'm O
just O
trying O
to O
you O
know O

we O
have O
a O
f- O
%um O
%uh O
%uh O

And O
that O
way O
you O
can O
freeze O
them O

so O
you O
know O
we O
'd O
end O
up O

yeah O
. O

there O
was O
sort O
of O
like O
a O
go O
or O
no O
go O
for O
breast O
pumping O

like O
once O
you O
just O
kind O
of O
got O
everything O
going O
it O
was O
like O
it O
ended O
up O
I O
was O
pumping O
too O
much O
you O
know O

it O
was O
like O
%mm O
okay O
. O
we O
ended O
up O
with O
a O
freezer O
full O

like O
we O
found O
a B-DATE
year I-DATE
later I-DATE
a O
freezer O
full O
of O
breast O
milk O
. O

God O
. O

oh O
let O
's O
just O
throw O
this O
all O
away O
. O

It O
's O
like O
all O
that O
hard O
work O

but O
you O
know O
it O
was O
either O
explode O
or O
you O
know O
pretty O
much O

But O
I O
thought O
like O
you O
totally O
got O
down O
to O
the O
level O
so O
even O
if O
you O
only O
breast O
fed O
you O
know O
once O
a O
day O
that O
that O
's O
how O
much O
milk O
you O
would O
have O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

All O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
is O
to O
get O
a O
big O
bag O
. O

okay O

It O
's O
like O
once O
I O
started O
at O
work O
I O
you O
know O

once O
he O
was O
getting O
bigger O
or O
something O
there O
was O

like O
I O
was O
making O
two B-CARDINAL
bags O

and O
it O
was O
like O
if O
you O
sat O
down O
you O
either O
did O
two B-CARDINAL
bags O
or O
you O
'd O
explode O

that O
was O
it O
. O

And O
she O
just O
could O
n't O
quite O
drink O
that O
much O

so O

%mm O
okay O
. O

You O
know O
that O
was O
why O
I O
was O
working O
in O
the O
morning O

the O
morning O
's O
when O
you O
do O
the O
most O
. O

Everybody O
's O
different O

so O
it O
probably O

yeah O

yeah O

that O
's O
true O
. O

Well O
I O
only O
have O
fourteen B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
left O

so O
. O

Wow O

're O
getting O

miscarriage O
anxiety O
starting O
with O

anxiety O
. O

I O
know O

oh O
no O
. O

I O
had O
the O
miscarriage O
anxiety O
up O
until O
the O

you O
know O
because O
you O
have O
all O
those O
well O
wishers O
you O
know O
telling O
you O
about O
all O
those O
things O
you O
know O
. O

ooh O
everybody O
wants O
to O
start O
telling O
you O
these O
things O

like O
people O
would O
like O
corner O
me O
to O
tell O
me O
about O
their O
hysterectomies O
. O

It O
's O
like O
somehow O
some O
O O
B O
gyn O
connection O
that O
they O
see O
you O
and O
they O
think O
of O
O O
B O
gyn O
and O
they O
've O
got O
to O
tell O
you O
about O

. O

oh O
my O

. O

you O
know O

yeah O

Well O
I O
've O
heard O
the O

me O
like O
totally O

completely O
freaked O
out O
. O

are O
you O

yeah O

I O
'm O
still O
here O

oh O

so O
I O
talked O
to O
my O
doctor O
about O
it O

and O
apparently O
it O
's O
very O
rare O

so O
do O
n't O
ask O
me O
why O
I O
've O
heard O
so O
many O
stories O
about O
it O

but O

oh O
yeah O

and O
then O
there O
was O
this O
friend O
I O
had O

she O
was O
eight B-DATE
and I-DATE
a I-DATE
half I-DATE
months I-DATE
pregnant O

and O
you O
know O
baby O
had O
a O
cord O
accident O

and O
she O
died O
. O

Like O
most O
people O
they O
just O
have O
babies O

it O
all O
works O
out O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
know O
. O

I O
know O

so O
I O
'm O
not O
so O
freaked O
out O
anymore O
. O

Good O
. O

That O
was O
like O

I O
was O
talking O
to O
Erica B-PERSON
on O
the O
phone O

and O
%uh O
that O
's O
what O
she O
told O
me O

she O
's O
like O
but O
d- O

to O
say O
that O
it O
was O
okay O
she O
was O
like O
saying O
that O
well O
you O
know O
but O
this O
woman O
is O
pregnant O
again O
and O
you O
know O
will O
have O
her O
baby O
again O
soon O

so O
it O
was O
like O
no O
big O
deal O
. O

No O

yeah O
. O

But O
having O
never O
been O
pregnant O
before O
, O
you O
know O
I O
'm O
sure O
Erica B-PERSON
has O
like O
no O
idea O

this O
woman O
must O
be O
on O
just O
you O
know O
absolute O
. O
pins O
and O
needles O
. O

She O
must O
be O
having O
the O
most O
miserable O
pregnancy O
in O
the O
whole O
world O
. O

yeah O

that O
's O
such O
a O
public O
thing O
. O

Like O
everyone O
knew O
she O
was O
pregnant O
. O

I O
mean O
once O
you O
're O
eight B-DATE
and I-DATE
half I-DATE
months I-DATE
, O
man O
, O
I O
mean O
there O
was O
nothing O
nice O
about O
it O

I O
know O
. O

you O
know O
if O
you O
've O
made O
it O
through O
the B-DATE
eight I-DATE
and I-DATE
a I-DATE
half I-DATE
months I-DATE
, O
man O
, O
you O
deserve O
a O
baby O
. O

I O
bet O

I O
know O

you O
know O
and O
then O
to O
have O
to O
go O
back O
to O
work O
and O
you O
know O

and O
then O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
pregnancy O
must O
be O
just O
like O
fraught O
with O
anxiety O
and O
especially O
since O
it O
happened O
at O
eight B-DATE
and I-DATE
a I-DATE
half I-DATE
months I-DATE
, O
you O
know O
. O

yeah O

and O
everybody O
is O
probably O
saying O
now O
you O
better O
really O
drink O
milk O
this O
time O
. O

You O
better O
eat O
your O
cottage O
cheese O
now O
. O

I O
Know O
. O

I O
know O

I O
know O

yeah O
. O

I O
actually O
did O
start O
drinking O
more O
milk O

and O
it O
has O
helped O
with O
all O
my O
little O
aches O
and O
pains O
and O
stuff O
. O

So O
what O
have O
you O
been O
up O
to O
? O

%ah O
nothing O
really O
. O

%uh O
yeah O
We O
've O
had O
a O
big O
change O
of O
%uh O
leadership O
over O
here O
. O

oh O
yeah O
? O

yeah O
, O

the O
base O
C O
O O
changed O
. O

The O
clinic O
O O
I O
C O
changed O
. O

The O
clinic O
C O
U O
nurse O
changed O
. O

And O
, O
just O
trying O
to O
get O
%uh O
, O
you O
know O
, O
the O
feel O
for O
how O
everybody O
else O
is O
you O
know O
, O
going O
to O
respond O
to O
them O
, O
and O
how O
they O
're O
going O
to O
respond O
to O
everybody O
else O
, O
has O
been O
trying O
, O
to O
say O
the O
least O
, O
for O
the O
past O
oh O
, O
probably O
, O
month O
or O
so O
. O

yeah O
. O

So O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
mean O
that O
's O
still O
a O
possibility O
. O

I O
mean O
I O
just O
did O
n't O
-- O
yeah O
. O
-- O
feel O
like O
it O
was O
the O
right O
time O
when O
I O
was O
home O
last O
. O

So O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O

I O
saw O
Sayonara O
again O
. O

I O
still O
see O
you O
with O
some O
little O
gal O
flying O
around O
going O
kari O
san O
, O
kari O
san O
. O

The O
supper O
is O
ready O
. O

Get O
thy O
ass O
on O
the O
table O
. O

No O
. O

Nothing O
like O
that O
going O
on O
over O
here O
. O

yeah O
. O

Well O
I O
'll O
tell O
you O
another O
a- O
, O
y- O
. O

Did O
you O
hear O
about O
Martha B-PERSON
getting O
married O
? O

No O
! O

Well O
this O
supposedly O
is O
going O
to O
happen O
. O

Now O
it O
has O
n't O
actually O
happened O
yet O
. O

So O
we O
may O
be O
at O
ground O
zero O
. O

I O
called O
her O
to O
chat O
I O
guess O
about B-DATE
two I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
ago I-DATE
. O

%um O
. O
And O
she O
'd O
said O
, O
oh O
, O
hey O
Bill O
. O
By O
the O
way O
, O
I O
'm O
getting O
married O
. O

This O
is O
a O
typical O
Martha B-PERSON
pronouncement O
. O

Ye- O

It O
's O
like O
, O
oh O
, O
okay O
. O

%uh O
, O
you O
know O
, O
tell O
me O
about O
this O
guy O
. O

How O
long O
have O
you O
known O
him O
and O
all O
that O
. O

oh O
well O
I O
've O
been O
dating O
him O
since B-DATE
April I-DATE

but O
I O
have O
n't O
really O
told O
anybody O
. O

And O
I O
thought O
well O
this O
is O
true O
, O
cause O
Martha B-PERSON
you O
and O
I O
have O
been O
in O
pretty O
good O
touch O
since B-DATE
April I-DATE
, O
and O
you O
never O
mentioned O
it O
. O

But O
this O
guy O
supposedly O
is O
a O
retired O
Marine O
pilot O
. O

%um O
. O

He O
just O
retired O
out O
, O

so O
he O
's O
kind O
of O
thinking O
what O
he O
wants O
to O
do O
now O
. O

I O
think O
for O
some O
reason O
the O
guy O
was O
an O
A O
six B-CARDINAL
driver O
. O

And O
, O
%uh O
, O
it O
seems O
like O
they O
just O
really O
hit O
it O
off O
and O
clicked O
. O

And O
I O
think O
he O
has O
one O
child O
but O
he O
does O
n't O
have O
custody O
. O

%um O
. O
So O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
scoop O
on O
this O
guy O
. O

But O
they O
have O
n't O
set O
a O
date O
or O
anything O
. O

They O
just O
decided O
they O
were O
going O
to O
get O
married O
, O
and O
do O
it O
real O
informal O
and O
all O
this O

and O

I O
know O
. O

So O
. O
I O
asked O
if O
he O
was O
drinking O
buddies O
with O
Luke B-PERSON

and O
that O
did O
n't O
go O
over O
real O
good O
. O

So O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
the O
scoop O
. O

But O
, O
%uh O
, O
she O
's O
still O
in O
San B-GPE
Diego I-GPE
and O
seems O
to O
have O
settled O
pretty O
much O
there O
. O

%uh O
. O
In O
mine O
%uh O
, O
I O
've O
changed O
qui- O
. O

I O
'm O
trying O
to O
remember O
. O

Last O
time O
I O
probably O
talked O
to O
you O
was O
what O
, O
last O
spring O
? O

yeah O
. O

I O
know O
, O

we O
're O
the O
world O
's O
best O
at O
keeping O
in O
touch O
. O

Well O
I O
'm O
on O
the O
road O
now O
moving O
from O
New B-GPE
Orleans I-GPE
. O

I O
'm O
finally O
left O
The O
Big O
Easy O
, O

and O
I O
'm O
going O
up O
to O
Vermont B-GPE
, O
believe O
it O
or O
not O
, O
for O
graduate O
school O
. O

oh O
, O
you O
are O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
finally O
decided O
to O
go O
ahead O
and O
get O
on O
the O
ball O
. O

And O
, O
I O
knew O
I O
wanted O
to O
teach O
English B-LANGUAGE
as O
a O
second O
language O
as O
a O
career O

but O
I O
'd O
never O
really O
done O
anything O
about O
it O
. O

So O
I O
started O
doing O
it O
in O
New B-GPE
Orleans I-GPE
as O
a O
private O
tutor O
and O
then O
got O
picked O
up O
by O
a O
little O
private O
school O
down O
there O
to O
teach O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
And O
knew O
this O
was O
what O
I O
wanted O
to O
do O

so O
I O
got O
it O

%uh O
I O
applied O
and O
got O
accepted O
into O
graduate O
school O
up O
in O
Vermont B-GPE
, O

specializes O
in O
kicking O
you O
out O
into O
a O
one B-DATE
year I-DATE
Master O
's O
program O
. O

do O
that O
. O

So O
this O
starts O
in O
late B-DATE
August I-DATE

and O
I O
'm O
on O
the O
way O
up O
there O
kind O
of O
meandering O
up O
to O
the O
states O
and O
seeing O
anybody O
and O
everybody O
. O

So O
if O
your O
dead O
old O
behind O
was O
in O
the B-GPE
States I-GPE
, O
I O
could O
, O
you O
know O
, O
make O
a O
point O
to O
go O
by O
and O
find O
you O

but O
since O
you O
're O
still O
in O
-- O
yeah O
. O
the O
land O
of O
large O
explosions O
, O
I O
have O
n't O
been O
able O
to O
do O
that O
. O

yeah O
. O

Well O
your O
tour O
is O
what O
three B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
Ker O
, O

or O

I O
've O
only O
got O
about B-DATE
six I-DATE
months I-DATE
left O
over O
here O
. O

I O
was O
going O
to O
say O
I O
thought O

know O
where O
you O
're O
going O
yet O
? O

Stumps O
. O

You O
're O
kidding O

. O

No O

I O
think O
I O
know O
some O
folks O
out O
there O
. O

yeah O
, O

well O
, O
you O
know O
. O
I O
called O
the O
detailer O

and O
, O
I O
had O
originally O
, O
%uh O
, O
applied O
for O
a O
fellowship O
to O
work O
with O
the O
Joint O
Commission O
&on O
Accreditation O
&of O
Hospitals O
. O
mhm O
Which O
would O
have O
been O
a O
year O
long O
out O
service O
fellowship O
up O
in O
Chicago B-GPE
which O

the O
town O
that O
they O
had O
this O

ten B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
from O
where O
I O
went O
to O

Right O

So O
I O
thought O

'd O
be O
great O
. O
You O
know O
. O

But O
, O
%uh O
, O
they O
picked O
some O
physician O
to O
go O
. O

yeah O
. O

So O
the O
only O
other O
choice O
they O
gave O
me O
was O
either O
, O
%uh O
, O
Great O
Mistakes O
mhm O
or O
Twenty B-CARDINAL
Nine I-CARDINAL
Palms O

mhm O
. O

And O
, O
the O
detailer O

%uh O
. O

I O
said O
, O
well O
, O
let O
me O
think O
about O
it O
for O
a O
while O
. O

and O
, O
probably O
forty B-TIME
five I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
after O
I O
hung O
up O
with O
her O
, O
she O
called O
me O
back O

the O
director O
of O

out O
there O
wanted O
me O
to O
be O
the O
department O
head O
for O
emergency O
nursing O
. O

Wow O

%um O

I O

soon O
would O
commander O
be O
coming O
around O
the O
pike O
for O
you O
Kerry B-PERSON
? O

%ah O
, O
well O
, O
I O
would O
be O
in O
zone O
next O
year O
. O

okay O
, O

so O
that O
would O
n't O
blow O
the O
department O
head O
thing O
if O
you O
pick O
up O
commander O
would O
it O
? O

But O

No O
, O
no O
, O
%uh O
%uh O
. O

But O
guess O
who O
got O
deep O
selected O
. O

For O
commander O
? O

yeah O
. O

Let O
me O
think O
. O

oh O
, O
it O
's O
got O
to O
be O
Barney B-PERSON
. O

oh O
yeah O
. O

Well O
now O
, O
I O
also O
heard O
. O

Now O
I O
think O
I O
heard O
this O
from O
Martha B-PERSON
. O

I O
heard O
Barney O
had O
some O
kind O
of O
terminal O
disease O
. O

Well O
, O
Barney B-PERSON
has O
cancer O
. O

okay O
. O

%uh O
he O
had O
some O
sort O
of O
%uh O
, O
-- O
-- O
%uh O
, O
-- O
-- O
mouth O
and O
throat O
cancer O
. O

yeah O
. O

You O
know O
he O
's O
a O
big O
golfer O
. O

Right O
. O

And O
after O
they O
tee O
off O
they O
stick O
their O
golf O
tee O
in O
their O
mouth O
? O

oh O
no O
. O

yeah O
, O

well O
they O
think O
that O
this O
cancer O
developed O
from O
the O
bug O
spray O
and O
the O
weed O
killer O
that O
they O
put O
on O
the O
grass O
. O

oh O
man O
. O

yeah O
, O

so O
I O
saw O
Barn- O
. O

I O
was O
back O
in O
the B-GPE
States I-GPE
in O
March B-DATE
. O

And O
, O
%uh O
, O
I O
saw O
Barney B-PERSON
at O
this O
convention O
that O
I O
was O
at O
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
, O
he O
was O
as O
skinny O
as O
you O
are O
. O

You O
're O
kidding O
me O
. O

No O
. O

Good O
god O
. O

Cause O
he O
was O
always O
built O
like O
a O
seal O
or O
something O
. O

He O
was O
huge O
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
%uh O
, O
you O
know O
he O
had O
gone O
through O
chemo O
, O
and O
was O
in O
the O
process O
of O
getting O
radiation O

so O
he O
like O
had O
you O
know O
, O
one O
hair O
per O
square O
inch O
on O
his O
head O
. O
yeah O
. O
And O
, O
%uh O
, O
could O
barely O
talk O
because O
that O
's O
where O
they O
were O
focusing O
the O
radiation O
. O

Right O
. O

%uh O
, O
and O
he O
looked O
like O
death O
warmed O
over O
. O

You O
know O
he O

yeah O
. O

You O
see O
the O
Auschwitz B-FAC
pictures O
, O

and O
that O
was O
Barney B-PERSON
. O

Barney B-PERSON
&von I-PERSON
Lipstien I-PERSON
. I-PERSON

yeah O
. O

yeah O
. O

But O
, O
%um O
, O

yeah O

he O
worked O
for O
, O
%uh O
, O
General O
%uh O
-- O
-- O
Krulac B-PERSON
. O

okay O
. O
okay O
. O

You O
just O
said O
the O
magic O
words O
. O

So O
mhm O
. O

I O
got O
you O
. O

yeah O

I O
've O
got O
another O
buddy O
who O
, O
%uh O
, O
is O
a O
marine O
pilot O
. O

I O
'm O
trying O
to O
think O
if O
you O
had O
ever O
met O
this O
guy O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
so O
. O

He O
, O
%um O
, O
worked O
for O
him O
as O
an O
aide O
. O

And O
so O
he O
was O
chuckling O
the O
other O
day O
, O
well O
probably O
the O
other O
day O
the O
other O
year O
when O
he O
heard O
Krulac B-PERSON
had O
been O
selected O
to O
be O
the O
next O
big O
boy O
. O

And O
he O
thought O
you O
know O
, O
Bill B-PERSON
whatever O
happens O
, O
I O
'm O
good O
to O
go O
now O
, O
I O
'm O
golden O
. O

oh O
yeah O
. O

yeah O
, O

it O
was O
a O
real O
surprise O
to O
hear O
, O

and O
when O
I O
talked O
to O
Barney B-PERSON
-- O
Wow O
. O
we O
did O
n't O
really O
spend O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
time O
talking O
about O
the O
. O

yeah O
. O

yeah O
. O

But O
you O
know O
, O
I O
asked O
him O
point O
blank O
, O

I O
said O
what O
was O
what O
the O
prognosis O
was O
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
he O
said O
poor O
. O

%um O
, O
but O
he O
did O
n't O
say O
terminal O
. O

yeah O
. O

%um O

okay O
I O
think O
I O
had O
kind O
of O
assumed O
that O
I O
guess O
from O
talking O
to O
Martha B-PERSON
because O
she O
may O
have O
over O
glorified O
it O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

Well O
, O
you O
know O
, O
and O
Barney B-PERSON
's O
wife O
Barb B-PERSON
is O
down O
in O
Sansabel B-GPE

mhm O

And O
I O
talk O
to O
her O
fairly O
frequently O
. O

And O
she O
said O
that O
%um O
, O
mhm O
she O
just O
saw O
him O
a B-DATE
couple I-DATE
of I-DATE
months I-DATE
ago I-DATE
mhm O
. O
And O
that O
he O
was O
starting O
to O
gain O
weight O
back O
again O
. O

So O
Super O
. O
You O
know O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
whether O
they O
managed O
to O
get O
all O
the O
cancer O
with O
the O
chemo O
and O
the O
radiation O
or O
what O
. O

yeah O
. O

But O
%uh O
You O
know O
I O
knew O
when O
the O
list O
came O
out O

I O
did O
n't O
even O
have O
to O
look O
, O
you O
know O
, O
because O
I O
knew O
that O
both O
Barney B-PERSON
and O
I O
were O
, O
%um O
, O
eligible O
. O
mhm O
Not O
in O
zone O
but O
eligible O
. O

mhm O
. O

And O
I O
knew O
of O
anybody O
, O
he O
would O
be O
the O
one O
that O
would O
be O
deep O
selected O
. O

Well O
, O
being O
%uh O
buds O
with O
old O
Chuck B-PERSON
Krulac I-PERSON
did O
n't O
hurt O
things O
a O
whole O
lot O
either O
. O

oh O
no O
. O

Not O
at O
all O
. O

And O
, O
you O
know O
, O
when O
I O
ran O
into O
him O
, O
%uh O
, O
in O
March B-DATE
, O
it O
was O
at O
some O
symposium O
in O
San B-GPE
Diego I-GPE
, O
a O
Nurse B-ORG
Corps I-ORG
thing O
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
, O
%um O
, O
Admiral O
Engel B-PERSON
, O
the O
Nurse B-ORG
Corps I-ORG
admiral O
was O
there O
. O

And O
You O
know O
, O
Barney B-PERSON
knows O
her O
like O
they O
're O
best O
buds O
. O

So O
, O
you O
know O
, O
I O
'm O

No O
more O
new O
pictures O
with O
vice O
president O
sons O
on O
stretchers O
. O

%uh O
, O
no O
, O
not O
yet O
. O

I O
was O
expecting O
to O
see O
him O
taping O
up O
Socks O
or O
Chelsea B-PERSON
any O
day O
now O
. O

Well O
, O
it O
would O
n't O
surprise O
me O
either O
. O

Emergency O
surgeon O
Barney B-PERSON
Berens I-PERSON
flown O
into O
the B-FAC
White I-FAC
House I-FAC
today O
. O

he O
's O
talking O
about O
going O
to O
D O
C O
next O
. O

But O
mhm O
I O
guess O
you O
got O
to O
spend O
a B-DATE
year I-DATE
in O
San B-GPE
Diego I-GPE
for O
follow O
up O
. O

yeah O
. O

oh O
. O

And O
then O
, O
%uh O
, O
after O
the O
whole O
episode O
called O
her O
back O
later O
, O

did O
n't O
remember O
it O
ever O
happened O
, O
and O
said O
you O
know O
, O
we O
got O
to O
get O
together O
sometime O
. O

oh O
jeez O
. O

So O
I O
think O
this O
is O
what O
preempted O
Martha B-PERSON
to O
, O
%uh O
. O

All O
her O
old O
beaus O
are O
definitely O
losing O
it O
. O

I O
think O
it O
prompted O
her O
to O
get O
married O
. O

I O
'm O
trying O
to O
think O
if O
I O
've O
got O
any O
other O
news O

I O
had O
n't O
been O
as O
much O
in O
touch O
with O
the O
other O
folks O
tha- O
know O
Martha B-PERSON
. O

I O
usually O
am O
at O
least O
keeping O
abreast O
of O
things O
. O

I O
think O
Pete B-PERSON
and O
Jennifer B-PERSON
still O
there O

you O
know O
she O
picked O
up O
lieutenant O
commander O

yeah O

I O
saw O
Jennifer B-PERSON
at O
the O
same O
conference O
. O

oh O
okay O
. O

yeah O

Does O
she O
still O
look O
like O
a O
Teutonic B-NORP
%uh O
pin O
- O
up O
? O

mhm O

oh O
man O
. O

Although O
her O
%uh O
hair O
color O
is O
getting O
a O
little O
darker O
. O

oh O
really O
? O

yeah O

%uh O
she O
's O
not O
bleaching O
it O
out O
quite O
as O
much O

I O
did O
n't O
know O
she O
was O
a O
bleached O
blond O

Are O
you O
kidding O
me O

oh O
yeah O

I O
'm O
good O

how O
are O
you O
? O

%eh O
, O
okay O

my O
flight O
plans O
everything O
are O
so O
crazy O
you O
know O

if O
your O
mom O
was O
getting O
married O
one B-DATE
week I-DATE
later I-DATE
uh-huh O
. O
I O
would O
've O
been O
able O
to O
save O
about B-MONEY
three I-MONEY
hundred I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
. O

oh O
no O
. O

Because O
all O
the O
airlines O
are O
dropping O
their O
rates O
September B-DATE
fifth I-DATE
to O
six B-MONEY
hundred I-MONEY
and I-MONEY
fifty I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
round O
trip O
. O

oh O
. O

but O
%uh O
it O
was O
too O
late O

yeah O
. O

That O
's O
too O
bad O
. O

And O
when O
I O
'm O
coming O
into O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
the O
first O
day O
apparently O
I O
'm O
stuck O
their O
for O
twelve B-TIME
hours I-TIME
in O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
get O
a O
continuing O
flight O
to O
Buffalo B-GPE
until O
five B-TIME
in I-TIME
the I-TIME
evening I-TIME
. O

I O
'm O
landing O
at O
five B-TIME
in I-TIME
the I-TIME
morning I-TIME
. O

oh O
. O

But O
, O
hopefully O
, O
my O
friend O
Bea B-PERSON
who O
was O
in O
the O
American B-NORP
class O
-- O
yeah O
. O
-- O
quite O
a O
few O
y- O
. O

she O
lives O
in O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
city I-GPE
in O
the O
area O
now O
. O

So O
hopefully O
she O
'll O
be O
meeting O
me O
for O
the O
day O
. O

oh O
that O
's O
good O
. O

So O
, O
it O
should O
n't O
be O
too O
bad O
then O
, O
you O
know O
, O
if O
we O
can O
spend O
the O
day O
together O

You O
know O
Hugo B-PERSON
and O
Shoshana B-PERSON

Hugo B-PERSON
and O
Shoshana B-PERSON
? O

%um O

I O
guess O
it O
's O
like O
%um O
Opa B-PERSON
's O

is O
Hugo B-PERSON

so O
it O
was O
like O
Ferdie B-PERSON
's O
-- O
yeah O
-- O
uncle O
or O
cousin O
or O
something O

No O
I O
remember O
the O
name O
. O

They O
're O
really O
nice O

and O
they O
come O
to O
Israel B-GPE
every O
once O
in O
a O
while O
because O
one O
of O
their O
kids O
lives O
in O
Israel B-GPE

and O

oh O
wait O
, O

is O
that O
the O
one O
that O
lived O
in O
Jerusalem B-GPE
? O

Beanie B-PERSON

%um O
. O
What O
? O

There O
's O
some O
relative O
of O
Ferdie B-PERSON
's O
that O
lives O
in O
Jerusalem B-GPE
. O

No O
, O
it O
's O
not O
them O
. O

Those O
are O
the O
Epsteins B-PERSON
. O

%ah O
, O
the O
Epsteins B-PERSON
. O

okay O
. O

%um O
no O

But O
that O
's O
your O
mother O
's O
side O
, O
the O
Epsteins B-PERSON
, O

No O
actually O
that O
's O
Ferdie B-PERSON
's O
side O

-- O
I O
mean O
your O
. O

Ferdie B-PERSON
's O
mother O
's O
side O
, O
right O
? O

Right O
, O
right O
. O

Right O
. O

But O
anyway O
, O
they O
live O
in O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
City I-GPE
in O
Queens B-GPE

and O
they O
're O
really O
nice O

so O
if O
you O
get O
stuck O
like O
you O
know O
I O
could O
give O
you O
their O
number O
or O
something O
. O

uh-huh O

yeah O

well O
no O
I O

hopefully O
it O
will O
be O
okay O

yeah O
. O

%um O
what O
was O
I O
going O
to O
say O

%um O
%ah O
so O
anyway O
%uh O
what O
I O
'm O
doing O
I O
'll O
be O
just O
like O
only O
four B-DATE
days I-DATE
in O
Buffalo B-GPE
. O

my O
friend O
, O
Cathy B-PERSON
. O

uh-huh O

And O
then O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
Johnny B-PERSON

and O
I O
think O
we O
have O
-- O

When O
are O
you O
getting O
to O
Johnny B-PERSON
's O
? O

I O
'm O
flying O
in O
on O
the O
twenty B-DATE
- I-DATE
eighth I-DATE
. O

oh O
, O
I O
'll O
probably O
just O
be O
leaving O
Michigan B-GPE
then O
. O

By O
ya- O

Like O
to O
drive O
to O
South B-GPE
Carolina I-GPE
. O

uh-huh O
. O

I O

Because O
he O
's O
got O
off O
from O
the O
twenty B-DATE
- I-DATE
eighth I-DATE

and O
right O
now O
I O
've O
got O
a O
flight O
that O
I O
'm O
coming O
in O
like O
ten B-CARDINAL
or O
eleven B-TIME
in I-TIME
the I-TIME
morning I-TIME
something O
like O
that O
. O

okay O
. O

And O
then O

And O
when O
are O
you O
all O
coming O
to O
South B-GPE
Carolina I-GPE
? O

I- O

What O
? O

When O
are O
you O
going O
to O
South B-GPE
Carolina I-GPE
? O

I O
mean O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
he O
's O
planning O
on O
doing O
it O

wait O

the O
luncheon O
or O
dinner O
thing O
is O
on O
the O
second B-DATE
, O
right O
? O

%um O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

Let O
me O

I O
think O
your O
mom O
said O
their O
was O
something O
planned O
the O
day O
before O
for O
the O
family O
. O

yeah O
, O

%um O
I O
have O
to O
find O
that O
calendar O
here O
%um O
. O

yeah O
, O

it O
might O
be O
like O
there O
's O
some O
dinner O
the O
night O
before O

that O
could O
be O
. O

I O
think O
so O
. O

So O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
whether O
we O
'll O
drive O
down O
the O
thirty B-DATE
- I-DATE
first I-DATE
or O
the O
first B-DATE
or O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
exactly O
whether O
he O
's O
going O
to O
do O
it O
in O
you O
know O
one B-DATE
day I-DATE
or O
two B-DATE
days I-DATE
. O

oh O

yeah O
. O

%um O
you O
know O
what O
? O

%um O
Cynthia B-PERSON
's O
coming O
and O
David B-PERSON
and O
their O
kids O

oh O
great O
. O

And O
they O
were O
going O
to O
bring O
Ralph B-PERSON

but O
I O
guess O
they O
're O
not O
sure O
now O
because O
they O
just O
found O
some O
kind O
of O
cancer O
in O
his O
brain O
oh O
no O
they O
Or O
a O
spot O
in O
his O
brain O
li- O

you O
know O
he O
had O
lung O
cancer O

is O
that O

I O
know O

and O
they O
were O
so O
optimistic O
. O

anyway O
they O
just O
found O
something O

and O
they O
're O
going O
to O
start O
treating O
it O
like O
this O
week O

so O
now O
they O
're O
not O
sure O
if O
he O
can O
come O

but O
mom O
thought O
it O
was O
so O
sweet O
that O
he O

have O
E O
D O
U O
at O

yeah O
? O

Mom O

does O
she O
? O

No O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
so O
. O

mhm O
. O

%um O
, O
Lori B-PERSON
, O
I O
'm O
trying O
to O
figure O
out O
my O
plans O
. O

I O
still O
have O
no O
idea O
what O
I O
'm O
doing O
when O
I O
get O
to O
Israel B-GPE

and O
nothing O
has O
worked O
out O

but O
I O
'm O
still O
coming O
. O

You O
're O
kidding O
. O

No O
, O
I O
'm O
serious O
. O

But O
I O
'm O
still O
coming O
. O

did O
you O
ever O
%um O
get O
in O
touch O
with O
%uh O

I O
had O
given O
you O
the O
fax O
of O
the O
number O
of O
the O
girl O
in O
%uh O

You O
mean O
the O

%um O
yeah O

well O
I O
did O
fax O
them O
a O
letter O
. O

It O
was O
little O
bit O
after O
that O
date O
like O
maybe O
a B-DATE
week I-DATE
later I-DATE
. O

yeah O
? O

I O
faxed O
them O
a O
letter O

and O
I O
never O
heard O
from O
them O
. O

and O
I O
ha- O

I O
basically O

what O
she O
kind O
of O
said O
is O
you O
know O
come O
and O
we O
'll O
talk O
sort O
of O
thing O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

yeah O
, O

so O
basically O
the O
one O

okay O

well O
Interns B-ORG
For I-ORG
Peace I-ORG
retracted O
their O
offer O
because O
they O
decided O
I O
was O
n't O
enthusiastic O
enough O
. O

Who O
's O
this O
? O

%um O
Interns B-ORG
For I-ORG
Peace I-ORG
? O

mhm O
. O

Like O
they O
had O
offered O
me O
a O
place O

and O
then O
they O
took O
it O
back O
. O

But O
did O
n't O
you O
also O
say O
you O
still O
were O
n't O
that O
keen O
on O
them O
? O

Right O
, O

I O
was O
n't O

but O
I O
still O
would O
have O
rather O
rejected O
them O
than O
have O
them O
reject O
me O
. O

yeah O
. O

yeah O

%um O
and O
then O
the O
next O
place O
which O
I O
was O
so O
hopeful O
about O
was O
%um O
Moden B-ORG
Nisan I-ORG

yeah O

yeah O

That O
thing O
at O
Haifa B-GPE
with O
%eh O
the B-ORG
Young I-ORG
Women I-ORG
's I-ORG
Leadership I-ORG
Program I-ORG
. O

yeah O
? O

And O
the O
woman O
made O
it O
sound O
so O
promising O

and O
I O
waited O
two B-DATE
months I-DATE
to O
hear O
back O

mhm O
. O

And O
then O
I O
had O
n't O
heard O
from O
her O

and O
it O
was O
after O
the O
date O

so O
I O
called O

mhm O
. O

And O
she O
said O
oh O
I O
was O
going O
to O
fax O
you O
this O
evening O

%um O
you O
know O
we O
're O
not O
really O
sure O
what O
's O
happening O
. O

The O
position O
may O
be O
being O
redefined O

%eh O
. O

And O
then O
a B-DATE
week I-DATE
later I-DATE
, O
she O
called O
me O
and O
left O
a O
message O
saying O
oh O
you O
know O
they O
had O
all O
these O
things O
on O
the O
burner O

and O
I O
should O
really O
look O
someplace O
else O
because O
they O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
's O
going O
on O

and O

%hm O
. O

And O
so O
I O
had O
really O
stopped O
looking O
for O
things O
because O
he O
made O
it O
sound O
so O
promising O
and O
like O
it O
was O
going O
to O
be O
almost O
fulltime O
. O

%hm O
. O

and O
now O
it O
's O
like O
you O
know O
maybe O
a O
ten O
hour O
a O
week O
position O

and O
it O
requires O
fluent O
Hebrew B-LANGUAGE

and O
it O
's O
just O
totally O
different O
than O
what O
we O
had O
talked O
about O
. O

That O
's O
a O
shame O

And O
so O
then O
, O
meanwhile O
, O
Giva B-ORG
- I-ORG
Haviva I-ORG
had O
offered O
me O
a O
very O
short O
term O
parttime O
internship O

yeah O
, O

you O
mentioned O

by O
writing O
up O
something O
to O

yeah O

like O
helping O
with O
grant O
writing O
and O
miscellaneous O
things O
and O
living O
on O
a O
nearby O
kibbutz O
maybe O
is O
it O
Ma'anit B-LOC
? O

%hm O
. O

You O
could O
be O
even O
living O
at O
David B-PERSON
's O
and O
Savia B-PERSON
's O
and O
get O
to O
Giva B-ORG
- I-ORG
Haviva I-ORG
. O

yeah O
, O

but O
it O
might O
be O
nice O
to O
be O
on O
the O
kibbutz O
because O
then O
I O
would O
get O
to O
know O
some O
people O
. O

yeah O
. O

yeah O

But O
anyway O
, O

so O
then O
%ah O

but O
that O
was O
three B-DATE
months I-DATE
ago I-DATE
that O
they O
offered O
me O
that O

and O
you O
know O
who O
knows O
if O
they O
found O
someone O

so O
I O
faxed O
them O
about O
a B-DATE
week I-DATE
and I-DATE
a I-DATE
half I-DATE
ago I-DATE
. O

yeah O
. O

mhm O
. O

And O
I O
had O
n't O
heard O
back O
from O
them O

and O
so O
I O
called O
the O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
office O

and O
she O
said O
she O
'd O
get O
back O
to O
me O
probably O
you O
know O
yesterday B-DATE
or O
today B-DATE
, O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
could O
talk O
with O
them O
. O

%hm O
. O

mhm O
. O

Because O
maybe O
they O
found O
someone O
, O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

yeah O
. O

So O
that O
's O

I O
'm O
really O
hoping O
that O
that O
would O
work O
out O
you O
know O
, O

it O
's O
just O
something O

yeah O
. O

But O
if O
not O
I O
mean O
I O
'm O
just O
coming O
anyway O

but O
I O
have O
no O
idea O
like O
where O
I O
'll O
go O

When O
are O
you O
planning O
on O
coming O
? O

And O

Sometime O
either O
like O
mid B-DATE
to I-DATE
late I-DATE
September I-DATE
or O
early B-DATE
October I-DATE
. O

mhm O
. O
mhm O
. O

%um O

Because O
I O
'm O
thinking O
that O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
stop O
in O
Europe B-GPE
on O
the O
way O
and O
visit O
some O
friends O
. O

I O
have O
a O
friend O
in O
Spain B-GPE
and O
a O
friend O
in O
France B-GPE
and O
a O
friend O
in O
Germany B-GPE

%um O
, O
no O
, O

I O
talked O
to O
**Dougo** O
. O

oh O
, O
how O
's O
he O
doing O
? O

Well O
, O
I O
guess O
. O

well O
the O
thing O
is O
, O
**Dougo O
's** O
kind O
of O
annoying O
me O
a O
little O
bit O
. O

oh O
why O
? O

Well O
, O
the O
first B-ORDINAL

%uh O
first B-ORDINAL
of O
all O
, O

well O
I O
think O
he O
sort O
of O
knew O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
him O
to O
be O
here O
. O

yeah O
. O

But O
still O
he O
oh O
I O
want O
some O
place O
to O
bring O
people O
. O

It O
's O
like O
how O
long O
are O
you O
going O
to O
be O
here O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

So O
I O
really O
%uh O
, O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
it O
's O
very O
appropriate O
or O
so O
forth O
. O

Like O
you O
're O
on O
vacation O
, O

I O
mean O
, O
what O
's O
the O
point O
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
it O
's O
just O
sort O
of O

I O
'm O
just O

that O
kind O
of O
annoys O
me O

it O
's O
kind O
of O
a O

Well O
you O
know O
why O
he O
wants O
to O
bring O
people O
there O
right O
? O

What O
's O
that O
? O

You O
know O
why O
he O
wants O
to O
bring O
people O
there O
right O
? O

Why O
? O

Well O
you O
know O
. O
His O
boyfriends O
and O
stuff O
. O

Yes O
, O

but O
I O
did- O
, O

n't O
want O
another B-PERSON
Lee I-PERSON
Worthy I-PERSON
, O
okay O
? O

yeah O
, O

well O

And O
I O
do O
n't O
, O

I O
'm O
, O

put O
it O
this O
way O
, O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
beyond O
that O
, O
okay O
? O

%huh O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
be- O

well O
I O
think O
Lee B-PERSON
is O
actually O
a O
little O
bit O
cleaner O
than O
. O

It O
's O
what O
I O
'm O
sort O
of O
kind O
of O
figuring O
out O
now O
after O
a O
while O
. O

uh-uh O
. O

And O
I O
just O
do O
n't O
like O
it O
, O

you O
know O
what O
I O
mean O
? O

uh-huh O
. O

This O
is O
not O
a O
motel O
, O
okay O
? O

oh O
, O
I O
know O
. O

okay O
? O

And O
it O
just O
kind O
of O
annoys O
me O
. O

yeah O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

It O
's O
like O
are O
you O
going O
to O
be O
showing O
up O

n't O

any O
of O
that O
other O
stuff O

yeah O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
sweetie O
, O

I O
just O

No O

I O
just O
think O
it O
's O
bullshit O
, O

I O
mean O
I O
have O
to O
b- O

its O

I O
know O
, O

I O
just O
think O
you O
're O
getting O
a O
little O
worked O
up O
about O
th- O

No O
! O

I O
'm O
sorry O
, O

I O
do O
n't O
got O
time O
for O
this O
crap O
, O
okay O
? O

That O
's O
about O
it O
, O
okay O
? O

y- O

I O
have O
to O
feed O
some O
animals O
now O
, O
and O
worry O
about O
that O
now O
. O

And O
then O
this O
other O
-- O
oh O
are O
you O
staying O
over O
there O
? O
-- O
rubbish O
. O

It O
's O
just O
. O

What O
's O
that O
? O

Are O
you O
staying O
over O
there O
? O

%uh O
, O
I O
'm O
thinking O
about O
it O
. O

yeah O
. O

yeah O
, O

well O
then O
why O
not O
, O
you O
know O
<E_S O
? O

I O
just O
wish O
you O
would O
mention O
to O
me O
before O
you O
offer O
. O

I O
did O
. O

Well O
I O
was O
kind O
of O
saying O
, O

I O
was O
kind O
of O
hesitant O
. O

yeah O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
you O
asked O
me O
. O

You O
mentioned O
it O
, O

and O
then O
it O
came O
up O
to O
discussion O
after O
you O
'd O
mentioned O
it O
to O
**dougo** O
. O

But O
beforehand O
, O
I O
'd O
kind O
of O
been O
kind O
of O
like O
negative O
on O
it O
. O

So O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O

I O
guess O
I O
never O
really O
thought O
that O
it O
would O
be O
that O
big O
a O
deal O
, O
you O
know O
. O

yeah O
, O

Well O

I O
mean O
%um O
, O
I O
just O
think O
that O
it O
's O
largely O
because O
you O
're O
in O
a O
really O
high O
stress O
situation O
now O
. O

I O
'm O
in O
a O
situation O
where O
I O
need O
full O
control O
of O
my O
environment O
. O

I O
know O
that O
. O

yeah O
, O

so O
. O

I O
was O
just O

And O
so O
I O
think O
that O
's O
why O
you O
're O

And O
then O

no O

but O
anyway O
he O
does O
n't O
call O
, O

and O
I O
just O

all O
he O
d- O
, O

I O
mean O
Friday B-DATE
, O

and O
all O
he O
did O
was O
give O
this O
message O
today O
, O
I O
want O
a O
key O
. O

I O
mean O
talk O
about O
a O
little O
bit O
rude O
, O

I O
'm O
sorry O
. O

Well O
. O

That O
's O
really O
rude O
, O
if O
you O
ask O
me O
. O

It O
's O
just O
like O
, O
I O
just O
want O
to O
use O
you O
for O
something O
here O
. O

I O
mean O
just O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
like O
that O
sweetie O

I O
think O
you O
're O
overreacting O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
think O
the O
behavior O
indicates O
that O
, O
at O
least O
. O

at O
least O
, O
you O
know O
, O
Mister O
very O
sensitive O
and O
aware O
of O
other O
people O
's O
behavior O
is O
obviously O
not O
super O
aware O
of O
his O
own O
a O
little O
bit O
. O

So O
. O

183.89_184.98_A: O
No O

you O
know O
that O

Well O
, O
no O
, O

but O
you O
know O
that O
he O
acts O
abrupt O
like O
that O
anyway O
, O
right O
? O

Well O
I O
'll O
just O
. O

I O
mean O

I O
'll O
act O
abrupt O
then O
also O
, O

so O
it O
's O
sort O
of O
funny O
. O

Well O

But O
anyway O
. O
The O
movie O
was O
good O
yesterday B-DATE
, O
though O
. O

I O
might O
call O
him O
back O
Monday B-DATE
. O

Well O
sweetie O
, O
what O
am O
I O
supposed O
to O
do O
? O

You O
know O
. O

oh O
you O
're O
not O
supposed O
to O
do O
anything O
, O

I O
'll O
take O
care O
of O
it O
. O

%ah O
I O
am O
going O
to O
mention O
to O
him O
that O
I O
did O
think O
it O
was O
sort O
of O
rude O
that O
he O
did O
n't O
do O
that O

and O
all O
I O
get O
is O
this O
message O
blah O
, O
you O
know O
. O

Well O
, O
you O
could O
, O

yeah O
, O

I O
mean O
I O
think O
it O
's O
valid O
for O
you O
to O
yell O
at O
him O
for O
standing O
you O
guys O
up O
and O
stuff O
. O

And O

Well O
it O
was O
n't O
official O
plan O
, O

but O
, O
it O
's O
not O
as O
if O
he O
gave O
me O
a O
number O
to O
contact O
him O
at O
. O

yeah O
. O

yeah O
, O

so O
I O
was O
%um O
a O
little O
bit O
put O
off O
by O
it O
. O
yeah O
. O
You O
know O
. O

and O
I O
was O
saying O

Well O
he O
could O
probably O
say O
that O
he O
felt O
put O
off O
by O
you O
too O
. O

So O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
so O
. O

I O
was O
the O
one O
who O
suggested O
going O
out O
and O
doing O
something O
. O

yeah O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
he O
can O
be O
say O
put O
off O
by O
me O
is O
that O
my O
life O
hangs O
in O
the O
balance O
, O
and O
I O
would O
like O
to O
be O
left O
alone O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
that O
's O
unreasonable O
. O
yeah O
. O
You O
know O
, O

you O
know O
, O
it O
's O

Well O
, O
I O
know O
, O

I O
agree O
, O

but O
you O
know O
, O
%um O
, O
also O
, O
if O
, O
you O
know O
, O
%uh O
, O
you O
're O
not O
going O
to O
be O
there O
During O
this O
week O
or O
two B-CARDINAL
, O
or O
whatever O

The O
way O
I O
kind O
of O
see O
it O
is O
like O
if O
you O
want O
a O
a O
soft O
place O
to O
lie O
your O
head O
down O
and O
fall O
asleep O
, O
and O
wake O
up O
, O
cook O
food O
or O
whatever O
and O
, O
putz O
around O
once O
in O
a O
while O
, O
that O
's O
fine O
. O

But O
if O
you O
want O
a O
place O
where O
, O
you O
know O
, O
it O
's O
time O
for O
a O
Saturday B-DATE
Night O
Fever O
party O
, O
I O
'm O
sorry O
, O

that O
's O

oh O
, O
come O
on O
. O

he O
's O
not O
quite O
like O
that O
, O

I O
mean O
good O
grief O
. O

Yes O
, O

but O
still O
, O

that O
's O
kind O
of O
my O
, O
you O
know O
. O

no O

he O
's O
got O
people O
that O
he O
has O
n't O
seen O
for O
quite O
a O
while O
. O

But O
do O
n't O
they O
live O
somewhere O

Well O

You O
know O
what O
I O
'm O
saying O
. O

Well O
, O
not O
all O
of O
them O
. O

%eh O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
I O
get O
the O
impression O
not O
all O
of O
them O
can O
go O
back O
to O
that O
place O
. O

I O
mean O
have O
you O
ever O
actually O
talked O
to O
him O
about O
it O
. O

No O
, O

but O
anyway O
. O

Well O
, O
because O
, O
, O
you O
know O
, O
it O
's O

oh O
, O
I O
understand O
, O

I O
think O
I O
understand O
what O
you O
were O
saying O
now O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
think O
I O
figured O
it O
out O
that O
, O

yeah O
. O

So O
he O
would O
like O
to O
have O
a O
place O
where O
%eh O
they O
can O
come O
and O
visit O
him O
. O

yeah O

and O
so O
It O
's O
fine O
with O
me O

Never O
mind O
, O

I O
thought O
about O
a O
hilarious O
word O
play O
. O

But O
anyway O
, O

never O
mind O
. O

What O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
say O
. O

But O
%uh O
, O
it O
's O
a O
word O
play O
on O
what O
you O
just O
said O
, O

it O
's O
kind O
of O
a O
**switcheroony** O
, O

it O
's O
, O

but O
it O
comes O
i- O

there O
's O
some O
truth O
to O
it O
, O
you O
know O
. O

oh O
. O

oh O
. O

what O
is O
it O
? O

Well O
they O
can O
visit O
him O
and O
come O
on O
him O
. O

%ah O
, O
%ha O
, O
%ha O
. O

%uh O
, O
%uh O
. O

Instead O
of O
coming O
and O
visiting O
. O

yeah O
, O

well O
, O
okay O
. O

I O
just O

But O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
anyway O
. O

Anyway O
. O

So O
, O
my O
thought O
on O
the O
whole O
thing O
is O
that O
you O
know O
, O
if O
you O
visited O
him O
, O
you O
would O
n't O
want O
to O
have O
to O
be O
you O
know O
, O
spent O
panting O
and O
spending O
every O
second O
of O
the O
day O
, O
with O
him O
only O
. O
You O
know O
what O
I O
'm O
saying O
and O
that O
probably O
part O
of O
the O
reason O
that O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
actually O
stay O
with O
him O
is O
that O
you O
could O
also O
go O
and O
visit O
the O
sights O
or O
whatever O
and O

Where O
? O

What O
are O
you O
talking O
about O
? O

In O
Japan B-GPE
. O

I O
'm O
not O
going O
to O
Japan B-GPE
. O

No O
, O

but O
I O
mean O

I O
'm O
trying O
to O

maybe O
in O
ten B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
but O
, O
no O
time O
soon O
. O

No O
, O
no O
, O

but O
, O
no O
, O
you O
know O
what O
I O
'm O
saying O
. O

When O
you O
are O
visiting O
a O
town O
and O
you O
stay O
at O
someone O
's O
house O
and O
you O
ca O
n't O
ever O
do O
anything O
on O
your O
own O
and O
stuff O
like O
that O
. O

So O

oh O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
mind O

he O
does O
stuff O
on O
his O
own O
. O

%uh O
, O
you O
know O
, O
I O
mean O
there O
's O
a O
difference O
between O
guests O

and O
there O
's O
a O
difference O
between O
ownership O
, O
I O
think O
. O

I O
think O
that O

I O
know O
. O

but O

There O
, O
I O
mean O
, O

if O
I O
live O
somewhere O
, O
you O
know O
, O
I O
can O
rearrange O
the O
furniture O
. O

yeah O
. O

But O
if O
I O
'm O
staying O
somewhere O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
mean O
I O
'm O
in O
jail O
. O

I O
mean O
just O
because O
I O
'm O
in O
a O
motel O
, O
does O
n't O
mean O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
repaint O
the O
walls O
. O

But O
it O
does O
n't O
mean O
that O
I O
'm O
obligated O
to O
stay O
there O
either O
. O

oh O
well O
I O
know O

but O
e- O

I O
'm O
just O
saying O
there O
are O
different O
degrees O
of O
, O
you O
know O

and O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
he O
's O
obligated O
to O
sit O
there O
and O
hob O
nob O
around O
with O
me O
the O
entire O
time O
either O
. O

I O
would O
n't O
want O
him O
to O
. O

yeah O
. O

You O
know O
I O
told O
him O
, O

I O
said O
I O
have O
no O
time O
to O
do O
anything O
. O

And O
I O
said O
I O

Well O
maybe O
that O
's O
why O
he O
was O
trying O

And O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
move O
back O
here O
, O
he O
's O
out O
. O

I O
totally O
insist O
on O
it O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
care O
if O
he O
never O
talks O
to O
me O
again O
. O

Because O
, O
there O
's O
no O
way O
I O
can O
study O
with O
worrying O
about O
keeping O
somebody O
awake O
, O
or O
, O
you O
know O
, O
I O
have O
to O
worry O
how O
I O
'm O
dressed O
, O
if O
I O
'm O
clean O
. O
You O
know O
. O
Whatever O
. O

yeah O

well O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
that O
sweetie O
. O

But O
, O
in O
that O
case O
, O
I O
think O
that O
while O

I O
mean O
he O
can O
stay O
while O
I O
'm O
at O
Erzhebat O
's O
, O

that O
's O
fine O
. O

That O
's O
just O

Ex- O
, O

that O
was O
my O
point O
. O

That O
was O
my O
whole O
point O
. O

That O

yeah O

okay O
. O

What O
is O
the O
big O
deal O
with O
just O
giving O
him O
a O
key O
and O
telling O
him O
to O
do O
what O
he O
wants O
. O

And O

Well O
I O
have O
to O
go O
make O
a O
copy O
too O
. O

Do O
you O
want O
me O
to O
, O
well O
. O
Give O
him O
the O
keys O
and O

You O
know O
what O
I O
'm O
saying O
. O

And O
I O
'm O
kind O
of O
thinking O
about O
saying O
, O
here O
give O
me O
a B-MONEY
couple I-MONEY
of I-MONEY
bucks I-MONEY
, O

I O
'll O
make O
a O
copy O
. O

yeah O
, O

or O
just O
give O
him O
your O
set O
of O
keys O
one O
day O
when O
you O
're O
studying O

and O
say O
here O
, O

and O
bring O
it O
back O
. O

You O
know O
, O
go O
make O
a O
copy O

and O
then O
bring O
it O
back O
. O

And O
, O
I O
mean O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
that O
unreasonable O
for O
him O
to O
ask O
for O
a O
key O
when O

you O
know O
, O
at O
least O
I O
anyway O
, O
yeah O
. O
yeah O
. O
okay O
maybe O
not O
you O
, O
have O
offered O
long O
time O
ago O
that O
oh O
, O
yes O
, O
you O
can O
stay O
here O
and O
**bladyblah** O
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
he O
knows O
that O
you O
're O
not O
going O
to O
be O
there O
. O

So O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
it O
's O
unreasonable O
at O
all O
. O

okay O
, O

yeah O
. O

I O
just O
think O
he O
needs O
to O
know O
that O
there O
are O
limits O
. O
Or O
whatever O
. O
That O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
it O
, O

I O
mean O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
be O
able O
to O
come O
here O
, O
during O
the O
day O
, O
anytime O
. O
And O
not O
feel O
like O
if O
I O
need O
a O
book O
or O
something O

yeah O

uh-huh O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
feel O
restrained O
because O
it O
'll O
frustrate O
me O
uh-huh O
. O
and O
I O
wo O
n't O
be O
able O
to O
concentrate O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
think O
that O
that O
would O
be O
reasonable O
. O

Just O
make O
an O
agreement O
with O
him O
you O
know O
, O
after O
what O
time O
of O
day O
will O
you O
call O
before O
you O
come O
over O
. O
yeah O
. O
You O
know O
? O

Or O
, O
you O
know O
, O
so O
like O
, O
between O
, O
%um O
, O
eight O
P O
M O
and O
you O
know O
ten B-TIME
A O
M O
if O
I O
have O
to O
come O
over O
then O
I O
'll O
call O
first O
. O

Like O
that O
. O

I O
mean O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
's O
unreasonable O
, O
you O
know O
? O

Or O
something O
like O
that O
. O

yeah O
. O

Because O
then O
he O
can O
feel O
comfortable O
and O
you O
can O
feel O
comfortable O
because O
you O
know O
what O
's O
going O
on O
. O
yeah O
. O
You O
know O
. O

yeah O
. O

and O
plus O
, O
you O
know O
, O
you O
're O
going O
to O
be O
at O
, O
%uh O
, O
Suzanne B-PERSON
's O
for O
what O
, O
till O
the O
eleventh B-DATE
or O
something O
? O

No O
till O

Well O
that O
's O
right O
. O

yeah O

when O
you O
come O
back O
I O
guess O
%uh O
I O
'll O
still O
be O
there O
. O

Still O
be O
there O
right O
. O

So O

because O
you O
'll O
be O
around O

Right O

so O
just O

But O
you O
'll O
be O
over O
here O
packing O
at O
that O
time O
, O
partially O
. O

yeah O
partially O

sure O
of O
course O
. O

I O
deposited O
your O
other O
rent O
loan O
check O
that O
came O
in O
. O

other O

li- O

a O
little O

What O

Laura B-PERSON
say O

Laura B-PERSON

that O
the O
commentators O
seem O
pretty O
high O
on O
the O
Skins O

yeah O

everyone O
did O

actually O
she O

although O
I O
have O
to O
say O
after O
the O
game O
last O
night O
%um O
beating O
Phoenix B-GPE
oh O

No O

n't O
heard O
from O
her O

bu- O

Well O
write O
to O
her O

she O
'll O
like O
that O

I O
try O

it O
's O
so O
hard O
mom O

you O
do O
n't O
understand O
how O
little O
time O
I O
have O
to O
do O
anything O
these O
days O

Yes O
I O
do O

and O
it O
's O
like O
impossible O

I O
've O
been O
waiting O
to O
find O
a B-TIME
half I-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME
when O
I O
could O
call O
because O
like O
it O
's O
like O
I O
have O
to O
use O
the O
whole O
half B-TIME
hour I-TIME

and O
there O
has O
n't O
been O
a O
time O
where O
I O
actually O
could O
just O
sit O
on O
the O
phone O
for O
a B-TIME
half I-TIME
hour I-TIME

oh O

oh O
We O
have O
to O
talk O
for O
a B-TIME
half I-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME

you O
ca O
n't O
split O
it O
up O
? O

No O

Not O
for O
free O

oh O

that O
's O
weird O

Well O
this O
is O
something O
very O
important O

We O
got O
the O
Washingtonian B-WORK_OF_ART

yeah O

uh-huh O

and O
they O
sa- O

but O
did O
you O
get O
Playboy B-WORK_OF_ART
? O

Playboy B-WORK_OF_ART
? O

yeah O

a O
girl O
in O
my O
class O
is O
in O
it O
. O

What O

I O
told O
you O
about O
that O
. O

A O
girl O
in O
my O
med O
school O
class O
is O
in O
this O
month B-DATE
's O
Playboy B-WORK_OF_ART

oh O

oh O
I O
did O
n't O
realize O
that O

I O
thought O
it O
was O
a O
long O
time O
ago O
Playboy B-WORK_OF_ART

No O
she O
did O
the O
posing O
over O
the O
Summer O

yeah O

oh O
I O
see O

but O
it O
's O
this O
month O

%hm O

Yes O

it O
was O
very O
funny O
at O
the O
train O
station O
yesterday O
When O
Elliot B-PERSON
went O
to O
go O
get O
his O
%um O
what O
you O
called O
Baron B-PERSON
's O
whatever O

and O
I O
'm O
like O
oh O
do O
they O
have O
Playboy B-WORK_OF_ART
here O

let O
's O
get O
it O

yeah O

%eh O

and O
everybody O
is O
looking O
at O
me O

Do O
you O
know O
her O

What O
? O

Do O
you O
know O
her O
? O

yeah O

I O
know O
her O
well O

she O
's O
a O
little O
bit O
weird O

She O
's O
beautiful O

%hm O

This O
is O
strange O

does O
n't O
that O
seem O
like O
a O
strange O
thing O
to O
do O

Yes O

I O
think O
so O

I O
think O
it O
's O

I O
mean O
what O
kind O
of O
a O
reception O
did O
it O
get O
? O

Mostly O
just O
like O
a O
gossipy O
I O
mean O

you O
mean O
the O
actual O
picture O

I O
mea- O

i- O

no O
no O
I O
meant O
what O
you O
're O
saying O

just O
gossip O

just O
as O
you O

yeah O

just O
everybody O
talking O
about O
it O

I O
think O
it O
's O
a O
very O
peculiar O
way O
to O
launch O
your O
medical O
career O

and O
I O
agree O

anyway O
so O
what O
about O
Washingtonian B-WORK_OF_ART

y- O

very O
foolish O
girl O

no O
it O
's O
going O
to O
follow O
her O

that O
'll O
follow O
her O
forever O

mhm O

but O
what O
abo- O

It O
really O
might O
not O
be O
bad O

oh O
come O
on O
Bo- O

It O
's O
a O
good O
picture O

yeah O

but O
are O
going O
to O
want O
go O
to O
a O
doctor O
who O
has O
been O
a O
Playboy B-WORK_OF_ART
bunny O
? O

You O
'd O
be O
surprised O
what O
people O
will O
go O
to O

I O
did O
n't O
say O
I O
would O

but O
you O
'd O
be O
surprised O
what O
people O
will O
do O

Well O
I O
w- O

it O
's O
publicity O

maybe O
going O
to O
med O
school O
was O
a O
great O
way O
to O
launch O
her O
career O
as O
a O
Playboy B-WORK_OF_ART
model O

that O
's O
right O

Is O
that O
what O
she O
said O

no O

anyway O
So O
what O
about O
Washington- O

no O
well O
what O
was O

alright O
Washingtonian B-WORK_OF_ART
is O
a O
lot O
more O
important O

They O
said O
that O
Maid B-ORG
Brigade I-ORG
is O
a O
national O
franchise O

So O
if O
you O
need O
a O
maid O
you O
can O
call O
Maid B-ORG
Brigade I-ORG

and O
you O
could O
get O

oh O
god O

but O
I O
already O
cleaned O
up O
my O
apartment O

yeah O

but O
it O
'll O
get O
dirty O
again O

believe O
me O

But O
I O
wrote O
you O
about O
how O
Elliot B-PERSON
cleaned O
it O
up O
this O
weekend O
did O
n't O
I O
? O

But O
does O
he O
always O
want O
to O
do O
it O
? O

No O

and O
he O
did O
n't O
clean O
it O
like O
Maid B-ORG
Brigade I-ORG
would O

he O
just O
picked O
the O
papers O
up O
off O
the O
floor O

I O
sort O
of O
had O
a O
feeling O
that O
might O
be O
the O
case O

he O
actually O
cleaned O
up O
the O
kitchen O
a O
little O
bit O
. O
di- O
and O
made O
and O
got O
brunch O

that O
was O
especially O
good O

Did O
you O
get O
my O
message O
about O
Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE

that O
you O
'll O
try O
and O
that O
I O
should O
make O
su- O

no O

that O

three B-DATE
days I-DATE

How O
many O
days O
and O
all O

yeah O

I O
think O
I O
get O
there O
around B-TIME
noon I-TIME

Lau- O

and O
that O
's O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the B-DATE
three I-DATE
days I-DATE

that O
's O
not O
in O
%uh O

if O
you O
get O
there O
noon B-TIME
that O
means O
you O
wo O
n't O
get O
like O
to O
a O
hotel O
and O
everything O
until O
two B-CARDINAL
three B-TIME
in I-TIME
the I-TIME
afternoon I-TIME
-- O

that O
's O
days O

yeah O

-- O
so O
you O
have O
the O
evening O

you O
have O
one B-CARDINAL
evening O

okay O
well O
I O
can O
do O
another O
day O

the O
problem O
is O
that O
like O
cuts O
down O
my O
time O
in O
Singapore B-GPE

yeah O

tha- O

oh O
oh O
well O
%hm O

like O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
that O
much O
time O

I O
had O
to O
leave O
on O
Sunday B-DATE

do O
you O
have O
to O
make O
the O
decision O
when O
you O
go O
to O
Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE
now O

I O
mean O
can O
you O
change O
the O
reservation O
with O
no O
cost O
later O

I O
've O
got O
until O
like O
the O
twentieth B-ORDINAL
I O
think O

no O
no O
no O

I O
mean O
once O
you O
've O
done O
it O
and O
you O
're O
coming O
out O
here O
and O
you O
decide O
you O
want O
to O
leave O
a O
day O
early O

I O
thought O
you O
know O
how O
those O
things O
are O
I O
could O
probably O
go O
standby O

but O
the O
thing O
is O
the O
flights O
are O
really O
packed O

they O
are O
? O

that O
's O
the O
trouble O

well O
the O
packed O
flights O

I O
sure O
to O
Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE
might O
not O
be O
packed O

right O

granted O

that O
's O

what O
I O
mean O
you O
could O
move O
that O
par- O

except O
there O
's O
the O
flights O
from O
there O
to O
Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE

are O
the O
flights O
back O
to O
the O
States O

and O
we O
're O
talking O
like O
January B-DATE
first I-DATE

Well O
that O
's O
true O

yeah O

and O
so O
that O
's O
when O
everybody O
goes O
back O

But O
you O
're O
not O
going O
to O
change O
that O

You O
're O
right O

No O
no O

not O
that O

you O
're O
missing O
the O
point O

my O
point O
is O
a O
United B-ORG
flight O
from O
Singapore B-GPE
to O
Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE
yeah O
is O
one O
that O
goes O
Singapore B-GPE
Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE
U B-GPE
S I-GPE

It O
'll O
be O
crowded O

yeah O

%um O
U B-GPE
S I-GPE

yeah O

So O
those O
flights O
will O
still O
be O
tight O

You O
would O
n't O
believe O
how O
much O
trouble O
I O
had O
getting O
reservations O

oh O

yeah O

I O
would O

I O
believe O
it O

yeah O

I O
figured O
%uh O

actually O
We O
're O
having O
trouble O
Now O
all O
the O
places O
are O
full O
because O
like O
I O
was O
wait O
listed O
to O
get O
to O
Japan B-GPE

mhm O

and O
then O
this O
woman O
Leigh B-PERSON
Turbush I-PERSON
that O

mhm O

You O
know O
our O
friend O
here O

She O
's O
trying O
to O
go O
to O
Hawaii B-GPE
this O
week O

and O
she O
's O
been O
trying O
for O
weeks O

but O
she O
ca O
n't O
get O
on O

well O
that O
's O
%uh O
Japan B-GPE

Hawaii B-GPE
is O
very O
crowded O

mhm O

yeah O

Japanese B-NORP
are O
just O
%oof O
%uh O
really O
apparently O
travel O

yeah O

but O
I O
mean O
the O
time O
of O
year O
does O
n't O
matter O

no O

apparently O
it O
does O
n't O
matter O

yeah O

you O
should O
have O
heard O

it O
was O
amazing O

I O
called O
every O
airline O
as O
you O
know O
only O
I O
can O
do O

right O

and O
%uh O
it O
was O
with O
much O
hesitancy O
that O
I O
called O
Continental B-ORG
because O
I O
hate O
them O
so O
much O

yeah O

I O
was O
on O
hold O
for O
ten O
minutes O
while O
she O
figured O
out O
this O
route O

I O
should O
've O
known O
that O
if O
it O
took O
her O
ten O
minutes O
I O
should O
've O
hung O
up O

She O
had O
me O
go O
from O
like O
Philadelphia B-GPE
to O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
to O
San B-GPE
Francisco I-GPE
to O
L B-GPE
A I-GPE
to O
Hawaii B-GPE
to O
Guam B-GPE
to O
Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE
to O
Tokyo B-GPE
to O
Singapo- B-GPE

I O
mean O
she O
had O
me O
everywhere O

I O
think O
they O
're O
the O
only O
ones O
who O
go O
to O

and O
she O
'd O
for O
three B-MONEY
thousand I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY

I O
was O
like O
are O
you O
joking O

Uy O

oh O
I O
have O
take O
fr- O

in O
a O
couple O
weeks O
I O
have O
to O
Guam B-GPE

and O
they O
're O
the O
only O
ones O
that O
go O
there O

the O
Continental B-ORG
? O

Continental B-ORG

yeah O

That O
's O
funny O

good O
luck O

can O
you O
at O
least O
go O
business O
class O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
I O
can O
or O
not O

yeah O

oh O
by O
the O
way O
you O
were O
right O
with O
Singapore B-ORG
Air I-ORG

it O
's O
only O
business O
class O
or O
first O
class O
goes O
Right O
miles O
to O
frequent O
flyers O

Right O

yeah O

%um O
Singapore B-ORG
Air I-ORG
takes O
you O
around O
through O
Europe B-GPE

they O
do O
a O
route O
that O
way O

yeah O

yeah O

that O
's O
how O
they O
like O
to O
go O

if O
I O
you O
know O
could O
have O
gone O
specially O
through O
Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE

right O

but O
that O
was O
a O
little O
bit O
more O
expensive O

and O
they O
also O
have O
connections O
with O
Delta B-ORG

yeah O

they O
only O
give O
miles O
on O
Delta B-ORG

but O
you O
can O
buy O
Delta B-ORG
seats O
on O
there O

right O

well O
actually O
they O
were O
going O
to O
send O
me O
on O
T B-FAC
W I-FAC
A I-FAC

I O
almost O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
worth O
it O
to O
do O
that O
instead O
of O
the O
United O
because O
%uh O
fewer O
connections O
instead O
of O
connecting O
in O
%um O

%eh O
well O
I O
mean O
it O
is O
a O
lot O
further O
to O
go O
through O
Japan B-GPE
and O
all O
that O
nonsense O

but O
the O
problem O
with O
Singapore B-ORG
Air I-ORG
is O
I O
have O
to O
through O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
through O
J B-FAC
F I-FAC
K I-FAC
. O
Uy O
which O
I O
now O
remember O
going O
from O
the O
domestic O
terminal O
to O
the O
international O
terminal O

right O

well O
T B-FAC
W I-FAC
A I-FAC
is O
not O
too O
bad O

you O
have O
to O
walk O
a O
little O
bit O

but O

yeah O

no O

I O
mean O
it O
just O
yeah O
it O
's O
not O
saving O
me O
much O
if O
I O
have O
to O
go O
through O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE

but O
Tokyo B-GPE
is O

same O
old O
same O
old O

oh O

Well O
at O
least O
put O
yourself O
on O
the O
waiting O
list O

can O
you O
do O
that O
? O

yeah O

probably O

but O
I O
have O
a O
feeling O
it O
's O
like O
a O
price O
thing O

Might O
not O
be O

I O
do O
n't O
know O

The O
thing O
about O
it O
is O
the O
city O
is O
so O
beautiful O

but O
it O
is O
so O
trashy O
too O

there O
's O
parts O
of O
it O
where O
I O
mean O
nobody O
takes O
care O
of O
it O

I O
mean O
there O
's O
litter O
on O
the O
ground O

and O
I O
mean O
there O
's O
parts O
of O
the O
city O
that O
are O
just O
you O
know O
graffiti O
on O
the O
wall O

and O
%hm O
. O
you O
know O
it O
's O
really O
kind O
of O
sad O
because O
it O
's O
such O
a O
historical O
city O
and O
there O
's O
parts O
of O
it O
that O
is O
not O
taken O
care O
of O
at O
all O

but O
anyway O

so O
we O
did O
a O
service O
project O
and O
%um O
went O
and O
picked O
up O
trash O
you O
know O

and O
%um O
we O
were O
all O
out O
there O
on O
the O
street O
%um O
that O
leads O
down O
to O
the O
old O
city O

and O
you O

all O
these O
Arabs B-NORP
started O
coming O
out O
and O
helping O
us O

and O
their O

started O
coming O
out O

helping O
us O

and O
some O
of O
them O

just O
come O
out O
and O
just O
stare O
you O
know O
just O
be O
like O
all O
and O
just O
kind O
of O
in O
amazement O
wondering O
what O
we O
're O

%um O
the O
whole O
center O
is O
built O
on O
a O
hill O

and O
so O
instead O
of O

I O
mean O
it O
's O
eight B-CARDINAL
floors O

but O
it O
's O
not O
like O
high O
rise O
eight B-CARDINAL
floors O

it O
just O
kind O
of O
cascades O
down O
the O
mountain O

you O
know O
what O
I O
'm O
saying O
? O

yeah O

you O
sent O

so O

oh O
yeah O

so O
you O
kind O
of O
saw O
it O

which O
one O
did O
I O
send O
you O

is O
it O
just O
of O
the O
center O
? O

yeah O

just O
like O
an O
aerial O
view O
. O

oh O
yeah O

okay O
so O
you O
know O
what O
I O
'm O
talking O
about O

yeah O

Anyway O

and O
so O
then O
%um O
like O
our O
room O
is O
on O
the O
fourth B-ORDINAL
floor O

mhm O
. O

and O
you O
actually O
go O
outside O
to O
get O
to O
our O
room O

there O
's O
a O
hallway O
that O
's O
outside O

and O
then O
the O
rooms O
are O
just O

I O
mean O
they O
look O
like O
little O
apartments O
you O
know O
that O
you O
get O
into O

and O
there O
's O
%um O

the O
hallway O
is O
just O
all O
done O
in O
marble O

and O
%um O
you O
know O
there O
's O
trees O
in O
the O
hallway O

and O
there O
's O
ivy O
that O
grows O
on O
the O
wall O

and O
you O
come O
into O
the O
room O

uh-huh O

%um O
and O
you O
know O
it O
's O
got O
our O
beds O
and O
the O
bathroom O
and O
stuff O

and O
then O
there O
's O
a O
patio O
where O
you O
go O
outside O

and O
there O
's O
a O
wooden O
trellis O
that O
kind O
f O
bows O
overhead O
and O
kind O
of O
makes O
a O
little O
roof O
for O
us O
I O
guess O

and O
it O
's O
got O
all O
of O
these O
flowering O
plants O
on O
it O
and O
ivy O

and O
then O
we O
have O
this O
big O
rose O
garden O
in O
front O
of O
us O

and O
then O
you O
just O
have O
this O
perfect O
view O
of O
the O
city O
. O

So O
you O
're O
actually O
above O
the O
city O

what O

yeah O

right O

we O
're O
above O
the O
city O

we O
're O
on O
mount B-LOC
Scopeth I-LOC
which O
is O
right O
next O
to O
the B-LOC
mount I-LOC
Olif I-LOC

and O
so O
%um O
Jerusalem B-GPE
is O
right O
below O
us O

it O
takes O
about B-TIME
fifteen I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
to O
walk O
-- O
Is O
-- O
into O
the O
old O
city O
. O

Is O
the O
Jerusalem B-GPE
center O
on O
the O
highest O
mountain O
around O
there O
? O

%um O
it O
's O

yeah O

well O
pretty O
close O

like O
Hebrew B-ORG
University I-ORG
is O
just O
above O
us O
. O

What O
's O
it O
called O
? O

Hebrew B-ORG
University I-ORG
is O
just O
right O
above O
us O

we O
go O
there O
a O
lot O

we O
have O
access O
to O
all O
of O
their O
stuff O
%um O
their O
library O
and O
everything O
like O
that O

but O
%um O

And O
who O
's O
that O
done O
by O
? O

who O

a O
University O

%um O
I O
think O
it O
is O
just O
a O
state O
university O
you O
know O

From O
Jerusalem B-GPE
%huh O
? O

yeah O

%ah O
well O

no O

I O
mean O
the O
state O
of O
Israel B-GPE

yeah O

ca- O

I O
think O
that O
's O
who O
runs O
it O

but O
%um O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
worldwide O
that O
are O
there O

%huh O

I O
'm O
sorry O

I O
'm O
like O
trying O
to O
wake O
up O

Well O
I O
thought O

I O
guess O
I O
was O
an O
hour O
off O

I O
thought O
it O
'd O
be O
just O
about O
seven B-TIME
o'clock I-TIME

and O
you O
'd O
be O
wide O
awake O
by O
now O

but O
You O
are O
now O

I O
am O
now O

we O
have O
tomorrow O
off O
too O

oh O
do O
you O

what O
's O
nice O
is O
we O
have O
like O
four B-DATE
days I-DATE
of O
classes O
and O
then O
we O
have O
%um O
three B-DATE
days I-DATE

it O
's O
weird O

%huh O
? O

yeah O

it O
is O

Sunday B-DATE
night O

see O
we O
have O
our O
Sabbath B-DATE
on O
Saturday B-DATE

and O
so O
it O
's O
so O
easy O
to O
get O
confused O
with O
days O

I O
forget O
what O
day O
it O
is O
because O
it O
just O
messes O
me O
up O
because O
Sundays O
you O
know O
we O
go O
out O
and O
go O
on O
field O
trips O
and O
everything O
like O
that O

and O

Old B-WORK_OF_ART
Testament I-WORK_OF_ART

And O
then O
I O

'm O
that O
class O

a O
lot O

actually O
we O
study O

my O
Old B-WORK_OF_ART

that O
's O
what O
it O
is O

okay O

'll O
have O
to O
give O
me O
a O
break O
because O
I O
'm O
a O
little O
tired O

Anyway O
%um O
that O
's O
a O
really O
cool O
class O
because O
you O
get O
to O
learn O
all O
the O
history O
behind O
everything O

And O
it O
starts O
making O
things O
in O
the O
Bible B-WORK_OF_ART

I O
love O
listening O

all O
of O

's O
really O
%um O
energetic O

and O

Arab B-NORP
Civilization O
class O
that O
I O
take O
%um O
from O
Brother O

's O
an O
Arab B-NORP
here O
a O
very O
prominent O
Arab B-NORP
%um O
Muslim B-NORP

in O
%um O
getting O

worked O
with O
President O
Hunter B-PERSON
a O
lot O
that O
knew O

very O
well O

he O
is O
so O
neat O

and O
I O
wrote O
this O
in O
my O
letter O
so O
you O
'll O
get O
it O
twice O

but O
%um O
he O
was O
talking O
to O
us O
one O
time O
in O
one B-CARDINAL

classes O

and O
he O
was O

%um O
somebody O
asked O
him O

he O
's O
known O
as O
a O
dry O
Mormon B-NORP
down O

and O
so O
somebody O
asked O
him O
kind O
of O
what O
that O
meant O

and O
he O
said O
he O
just O
started O

he O
kind O

laughed O

and O
he O
started O
going O

about O
how O
he O
first O
came O
in O

started O
to O
cry O

and O
%ah O
he O
you O
know O
had O
to O
stop O
and O
kind O
of O
excuse O
himself O

but O
he O
said O
that O
he O
always O
felt O
like O
in O
Islam B-NORP
they O
believe O
that O
Mohammed B-PERSON
was O
a O
prophet O
%hm O
And O
they O
believe O
in O
all O
the O
other O
prophets O
you O
know O
that O
Jesus B-PERSON
was O
a O
prophet O

an- O

anyway O

but O
they O
believe O
that O
Mohammed B-PERSON
was O
the O
last O
prophet O
you O
know O

and O
so O
he O
was O
the O
seal O
of O
the O
prophet O

they O
do O
n't O
worship O
him O
or O
anything O

and O
it O
's O
funny O
because O
I O
learn O
about O
the O
Jewish B-NORP
religion O
and O
it O
's O
the O
same O
thing O

you O
see O
all O
of O
these O
divisions O
happening O
and O
all O
of O
these O
questions O

and O
you O
ask O

you O
know O
there O
's O
the O
old O
joke O
%um O
if O
you O
ask O
%ah O
three B-CARDINAL
Jewish B-NORP
men O
a O
question O
you O
'll O
get O
four B-CARDINAL
opinions O

You O
know O
tha- O

I O
mean O
they O
're O
very O
you O
know O

you O
really O
do O

I O
've O
talked O
to O
several O
of O
them O

you O
really O
get O
different O
things O
because O
you O
know O
there O
's O
the O
ultra O
orthodox O
and O
the O
reformed O
and O
the O
anyway O
%um O

and O
so O
he O
was O
just O
saying O
that O
%ah O
he O
never O
thought O
that O
that O
was O
right O

and O
he O
said O
%um O
whenever O
I O
am O
with O
your O
prophet O
President O
Hunter B-PERSON
he O
says O
I O
can O
not O
explain O
it O

it O
's O
just O
a O
feeling O
inside O

and O
then O
he O
'd O
say O
do O
you O
know O
what O
I O
mean O

and O
we O
were O
all O
just O
silent O
you O
know O
and O
just O
nodding O
our O
heads O

and O
yup O
he O
says O
I O
just O
can O
not O
help O
but O
feel O
that O
this O
is O
a O
man O
of O
God O

totally O
noticed O
everything O
, O
specially O
like O
when O
we O
were O
on O
this O
tour O
. O

We O
went O
to O
like O
the B-ORG
Schwartz I-ORG
club I-ORG
with O
my O
group O
. O

We O
went O
there O
for O
the O
weekend O

and O
it O
frigging O
like O
rained O
all O
weekend O
long O
. O

We O
got O
there O

we O
were O
like O
let O
off O
on O
top O
of O
this O
fucking O
mountain O
like O

and O
we O
had O
to O
walk O
like O
probably O
like B-QUANTITY
five I-QUANTITY
kilometers I-QUANTITY
like O
to O
the O
place O
where O
we O
were O
sleeping O

and O
it O
was O
raining O

and O
it O
was O
like O
thirty B-CARDINAL
mile O
an O
hour O
wind O

and O
it O
was O
so O
nasty O

and O
we O
had O
to O
like O
walk O
through O
all O
that O
. O

mhm O

and O
%um O
we O
went O
to O
this O
like O
museum O
up O
there O

and O
the O
guy O
had O
like O
such O
a O
heavy O
dialect O
. O

It O
was O
so O
funny O
. O

He O
was O
talking O
to O
this O
little O
kid O

I O
heard O
him O
talking O

and O
he O
's O
like O
hi O
Stacey B-PERSON

I O
'm O
like O
hi O
Stacey B-PERSON

I O
'm O
like O
hi O
Sta- O

I O
'm O
like O
what O
the O
hell O
's O
that O
? O

Because O
they O
all O
say O
like O
S O
H O
instead O
of O
C O
H O

so O

that O
's O
funny O

well O
, O
it O
's O
easier O
. O

yeah O

yeah O
. O

easier O
for O
us O
. O

yeah O

but O
they O
're O
not O
American B-NORP
. O

yes O

well O

How O
are O
things O
with O
you O
? O

busy O

yeah O
? O

yeah O

I O
guess O
I O
sent O
you O
an O
email O

but O
I O
suppose O
you O
have O
n't O
gotten O
it O
. O

What O

like O
I O
have O
to O

It O
's O
at O
the O
university O

so O

yeah O
. O

That O
's O
what O
I O
figured O
. O

yeah O
. O

but O
my O
most O
exciting O
thing O
is O
that O
a O
publisher O
is O
interested O
in O
my O
personal O
ad O
book O
. O

Wow O
. O

yeah O
, O

so O
. O

That O
's O
so O
cool O
. O

Thank O
you O

so O
I O
was O
all O
excited O
. O

And O
I O
got O
this O
letter O

and O
I O
was O
like O

I O
did O
n't O
know O
if O
it O
was O
a O
scam O
or O
something O
. O

yeah O
. O

Well O
I O
'm O
always O
getting O
letters O
from O
vanity O
presses O
and O
shit O
. O

yeah O
. O

You O
know O
what O
I O
mean O
. O

Where O
you O
pay O
them O
to O

you O
pay O
them O
, O

yeah O

yeah O

so O
I O
looked O
them O
up O
in O
Writer B-ORG
's I-ORG
Market I-ORG

and O
they O
did O
do O
thirty B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
of O
their O
publishing O
vanity O
market O

so O
I O
was O
like O
okay O
. O

So O
I O
called O
them O
up O
the O
next O
day O

and O
it O
's O
no O
they O
want O
to O
really O
publish O
it O

Wow O
. O

but O
I O
mean O
the O
thing O
is O
they O
want O
the O
%uh O
completed O
manuscript O
in O
a O
month O
. O

I O
have O
holy O
shit O
. O
fuck O
the O
idea O
of O
how O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
do O
it O

and O
I O
mean O
that O
totally O
does O
n't O
guarantee O
that O
they O
're O
going O
to O
publish O
it O
. O

That O
just O
means O
they O
're O
more O
interested O
and O
they O
'd O
like O

whole O
thing O

the O
university O
and O
all O
the O
professors O
and O
everything O

to O
get O
it O
. O

and O
there O
's O
like O

but O
I O
simply O
can O
not O
do O
that O
. O

It O
's O
just O
not O
an O
option O
, O
you O
know O

yeah O

yeah O

And O
she O
's O
like O
well O
maybe O
we O
can O
meet O

the O

I O
was O
like O
yeah O
I O
'll O

I O
know O

I O
just O
have O
so O
much O
work O
to O
do O

and O
It O
's O
just O
not O
an O
option O
to O

just O
me O
and O
this O
other O
kid O

like O
he O
's O
not O

so O
it O

can O
just O
sit O
there O
and O
pretend O
to O
have O
read O
all O
of O
this O
stuff O

yeah O
. O

and O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
he O
just O
gives O
a O
ton O
of O
reading O
Probably O
not O
remembering O
that O
he O
's O
expecting O
us O
to O
do O
an O
extensive O
research O
paper O
, O
as O
well O
. O

Really O
? O

and O
I O
'm O
already O
up O
to O
my O
eyeballs O
in O
work O

and O
Joanna B-PERSON
Nichols I-PERSON
is O
insisting O
that O
I O
take O
this O
independent O
study O
with O
her O

but O
she O
does O
n't O
want O
to O
teach O
it O

what O
we O
're O
doing O
. O

She O
does O
n't O
want O
to O
meet O
me O
. O

It O
's O
like O

. O

I O
do O
n't O

. O

so O

oh O
she O
was O
on O
N B-ORG
P I-ORG
R I-ORG
last B-DATE
week I-DATE
, O
by O
the O
way O

Really O
? O

that O

she O
taught O

After O
she O
was O
on O
Talk B-WORK_OF_ART
&of I-WORK_OF_ART
&the I-WORK_OF_ART
Nation I-WORK_OF_ART

What O
was O
she O
talking O
about O
? O

She O
was O
talking O
about O
the O
origins O
of O
language O

but O
the O
thing O
is O
I O
did O
n't O
hear O
it O
because O
Eric B-PERSON
heard O
it O
in O
the O
car O
and O
he O
called O
me O
at O
work O
and O
left O
a O
message O
but O
Darren B-PERSON
was O
on O
the O
line O
. O

%uh O

So O
then O
Eric B-PERSON
got O
there O

and O
we O
turned O
it O
on O
. O

I O
only O
heard O
the B-TIME
last I-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
. O

I O
heard O
her O
laugh O
, O
though O
. O

Wow O
. O

What O
'd O
she O
do O
? O

Sit O
on O
a O
whoopie O
cushion O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
know O

but O
I O
mean O
like O
millions O
of O
people O
heard O
her O
laugh O
. O

It O
was O
pretty O
wild O
. O

so O
anyway O
I O
'm O
just O
so O
stressed O
out O
right O
now O
that O
I O
feel O
like O
crying O

and O
it O
's O
like O
the O
last O
thing O
I O
need O
is O
somebody O
going O
to O
me O
let O
's O
go O
out O

let O
's O
go O
out O

let O
's O
go O
out O
. O

It O
's O
like O
I O
ca O
n't O
, O
okay O
. O

But O
I O
feel O
bad O
because O
she O
's O
only O
going O
to O
be O
here O
for O
another O
week O
. O

I O
feel O
bad O
that O
you O
're O
so O
stressed O
again O
. O

I O
thought O
like O
this O
semester O
would O
be O
like O
better O
for O
you O
. O

I O
'm O
only O
stressed O
this O
weekend O
because O
like O
I O
have O
party O
and O
I O
have O
Diana B-PERSON
and O
I O
had O
to O
finish O
up O
that O
book O
review O
for O
Language B-ORG
Magazine I-ORG

yeah O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
even O
read O
the O
book O
. O

Wow O

Well O
, O
I O
hope O
nobody O
listening O
to O
this O
is O
from O
Language B-ORG
Magazine I-ORG
. O

but O
I O
indeed O
do O
a O
book O
notice O
and O
just O
all O
these O
things O
that O
after O
this O
weekend O
, O
like O
half O
of O
them O
will O
go O
away O
yeah O
You O
know O
? O

yeah O

So O
I O
do O
n't O
know O

I O
hope O
I O
go O
to O
Holland B-GPE
. O

Would O
n't O
that O
be O
cool O
? O

That O
would O
be O
so O
cool O
because O
like O
even O
this O
weekend O
I O
was O
just O
thinking O
because O
we O
're O
all O
like O
deciding O
we O
're O
like O
oh O
where O
do O
we O
want O
to O
go O
this O
weekend O
because O
there O
's O
like O
a O
cool O
offer O
%uh O
%um O
with O
the O
trains O
and O
stuff O
. O

for O
Thirty B-MONEY
marks I-MONEY
total O
like O
up O
to O
five B-CARDINAL
people O
can O
go O
anywhere O

so O
it O
's O
only O
like O
you O
know O
like O
five B-MONEY
marks I-MONEY
each O
within O
the O
German B-NORP
border O
for O
the O
weekend O
like O
leave O

How O
much O
is O
that O
? O

%um O
probably O
like B-MONEY
twenty I-MONEY
bucks I-MONEY
. O

uh-huh O
. O

So O
you O
can O
go O
for O
like B-MONEY
twenty I-MONEY
bucks I-MONEY
I O
mean O

but O
like O
really O
like B-MONEY
four I-MONEY
bucks I-MONEY
each I-MONEY
like O
Anywhere O
within O
Germany B-GPE
you O
-- O
uh-huh O
-- O
go O
for O
the O
weekend O

so O
we O
're O
going O

and O
%um O
then O
like O
of O
you O
want O
to O
go O
outside O
the O
border O
then O
you O
can O
like O
pay O
up O
to O
the O
border O

and O
then O
you O
pay O
an O
additional O
little O
fee O
. O

Right O
. O

And O
%um O
so O
we O
're O
going O
to O
like O
Switzerland B-GPE
this B-DATE
weekend I-DATE

but O
when O
we O
were O
all O
just O
like O
deciding O
where O
we O
wanted O
to O
go O
the O
weekend O
I O
'm O
like O
wow O
I O
wish O
Linda B-PERSON
and O
Eric B-PERSON
we O
here O
. O

I O
could O
just O
pop O
up O
to O
Holland B-GPE
and O
see O
them O

%ah O

yeah O
. O

Well O
I O
'm O
trying O
to O
get O
things O
done O

but O
Carl B-PERSON

you O
know O
I O
talked O
to O
Carl B-PERSON
. O

He O
's O
really O
busy O

yeah O

and O
like O
the O
board O
of O
directors O
is O
very O
unhappy O
because O
our O
American B-NORP
business O
is O
not O
doing O
very O
well O

so O
it O
's O
probably O
like O
a O
really O
bad O
time O
for O
you O
to O
be O
irritating O
Carl B-PERSON
about O
this O
yeah O
being O
the O
C O
E O
O O
and O
all O

yeah O
. O

but O
I O
called O
him O
up O

and O
he O
was O
like O
well O
I O
can O
let O
you O
know O

or O
I O
'm O
definitely O
outgoing O

like O
we O
could O
definitely O
go O

But O
did O
I O
tell O
you O
this O
? O

He O
said O
they O
might O
be O
moving O
. O

oh O
no O

So O
that O
means O
that O
they O
would O
n't O
have O
company O
housing O
. O

Where O
would O
they O
be O
moving O
? O

because O
they O
're O
above O
a O
furniture O
store O
right O
now O
like O
doing O
manufacturing O

so O

%ah O

okay O

He O
said O
%um O
but O
you O
know O
we O
'd O
find O
a O
place O
for O
you O
because O
he O
knows O
it O
's O
totally O
impossible O
to O
find O
a O
place O
in O
Utrecht B-GPE

yeah O
. O

It O
's O
like O
we O
'll O
find O
a O
place O
for O
you O

and O
we O
can O
ta- O

all O
I O
wanted O
to O
know O
All O
I O
need O
to O
know O
is O
how O
much O
are O
you O
going O
to O
pay O
me O
and O
what O
are O
you O
going O
to O
give O
me O
in O
this O
package O
? O

yeah O
yeah O
. O

%um O
but O
although O
they O
're O
trying O
to O
solicit O
more O
throughout O
the O
globe O
instead O
of O
just O
Japan B-GPE

mhm O
. O

although O
they O
've O
had O
most O
interest O
in O
Japan B-GPE
. O

mhm O
. O

And O
I O
teach O
probably O
two B-CARDINAL
classes O
and O
then O
do O
administrative O
work O
to O
make O
connections O
for O
these O
people O
to O
have O
tours O
or O
to O
go O
look O
at O
companies O
dealing O
with O
certain O
issues O
that O
they O
're O
working O
on O
in O
their O
classes O
. O

Half O
of O
their O
classes O
are O
business O
half O
are O
English B-LANGUAGE
business O

mhm O

mhm O
. O

mhm O
. O

mhm O

So O
it O
's O
really O
groovy O
because O
I O
mean O
I O
have O
all O
these O
contacts O
for O
them O
because O
of O
my O
experience O
in O
the O
business O
world O
here O
. O

yeah O
. O

yeah O
. O

you O
know O
and O
I O
do O
a O
little O
teaching O
for O
them O
too O
. O

okay O
. O

What O
classes O
did O
you O
teach O
at O
that O
would O
be O
related O
? O

I O
taught O
business O
English B-LANGUAGE
. O

uh-huh O
. O

I O
taught O
listening O
. O

I O
taught O
integrated O
skills O
and O
beginning O
grammar O
. O

okay O
. O

mhm O
. O

I O
'm O
just O
writing O
this O
down O
so O
Cool O
. O
You O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
tell O
them O
about O
or O
anything O
. O

oh O
weird O
. O

You O
know O
what O
? O

What O
? O

I O
had O
a O
dream O
this O
morning O
about O

it O
's O
weird O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
you O
were O
in O
it O
. O

I O
think O
you O
were O
. O

%huh O
. O

But O
Barry B-PERSON
was O
definitely O
in O
it O
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
Barry B-PERSON
and O
I O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

We O
were O
trying O
to O
get O
somewhere O

and O
we O
had O
to O
jump O
in O
this O
water O

but O
she O
would O
n't O
let O
go O
of O
me O
when O
we O
got O
in O
the O
water O

and O
I O
woke O
up O
because O
I O
start O
drowning O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
that O
means O
. O

I O
got O
a O
postcard O
from O
her O
too O
the O
other O
day O

yeah O
. O
That O
's O
a O
scary O
dream O
. O

It O
was O
pretty O
scary O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O

it O
was O
kind O
of O
one O
of O
those O
frustrating O
type O
dreams O
. O

%eh O

it O
difficult O
going O
back O
to O
the B-GPE
U I-GPE
S I-GPE
? O

yeah O
. O

yeah O
. O

It O
was O
harder O
than O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
actually O
. O

yeah O
. O

%um O
harder O
in O
the O
sense O
that O
%uh O
I O
was O
n't O
used O
to O
the O
pace O

mhm O
. O
you O
know O
the O
pace O
is O
totally O
different O
. O

mhm O
. O

%um O

And O
I O
did O
n't O
really O
want O
to O
see O
anybody O
for O
a O
while O
. O

and O
I O
did O
n't O
, O
which O
was O
fine O
. O

And O
I O
really O
missed O

the O
only O
person O
that O
really O
knew O
and O
understood O

And O

that O
was O
really O
tough O
because O
that O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
pressure O
on O
both O
of O
us O
coming O
with O
him O
again O
and O
all O
of O
that O
. O

mhm O

n't O
heard O
from O

at O
all O
. O

She O
sent O

a O
postcard O
. O

In O
fact O
we O
both O
sent O
you O
postcards O
. O

%ah O
. O

All O
right O
. O

yeah O
. O

You O
know O
what O
? O

What O
? O

I O
just O
came O
back O
from O
the B-GPE
U I-GPE
S I-GPE

and O
I O
have O
some O
letters O
for O
you O
including O
that O
little O
package O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
to O
do O
with O
that O
little O
package O
. O

it O
is O
henna O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

And O
%um O
I O
do O
n't O
know O

Well O
I O
think O
, O

no O
you O
know O
what O
I O
think O
you O
should O
do O
. O

Dorota B-PERSON
please O
. O

Really O
. O

%uh O
. O

The O
package O
of O
henna O
, O
share O
it O
with O
Magda B-PERSON
. O

Magda B-PERSON
is O
gone O

so O
maybe O
I O
'll O
do O
it O
in O
my O
hair O
. O

okay O
. O

It O
's O
a O
nice O
brown O
. O

oh O
is O
it O
? O

Good O
, O
good O
. O

yeah O
. O

Well O
a O
friend O
of O
mine O
from O
Florida B-GPE
sent O
that O
to O
me O
. O

%eh O
yeah O
. O

She O
's O
from O
Gainesville B-GPE

Gainesville B-GPE
Florida I-GPE
. O
mhm O
. O

yeah O

And O

yeah O

so O
I O
would O
like O
to O
think O
that O
it O
goes O
to O
a O
good O

because O
sending O
it O
back O
to O
me O
would O
probably O
just O
be O
ludicrous O

so O
you O
know O
why O
do O
n't O
you O
just O

So O
I O
can O
keep O
it O
. O

I O
'm O
opening O
it O
up O
right O
now O
as O
you O
speak O
so O

peace O
stamp O
on O
it O

I O
've O
worked O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE

though O
, O
thank O

. O

Because O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
any O
sick O

Do O
you O
have O

go O
through O
any O
physical O
therapy O
or O
anything O
like O
that O
? O

yeah O
, O

I O

Monday B-DATE
because O
I O
've O
no O
time O
to O
use O
. O
You O
know O
for O
sick O
time O
and O
stuff O
? O

yeah O
, O

because O
you O
took O
time O
when O
you O
had O
your O
surgery O
on O
your O
knee O
too O
, O
right O
? O

mhm O
. O

Exactly O
. O

I O
used O
a O
lot O
of O
it O
up O
at O
that O
time O
. O

mhm O
. O

So O
, O
I O
have O
none O
left O
whatsoever O
. O

I O
had O
to O
use O
up O
my O
last O
two B-CARDINAL
vacation O
days O
because O
they O
make O
you O
do O
that O
now O
for O
some O
reason O
-- O
-- O
which O
is O
fairly O
new O
which O
really O
is O
n't O
fair O

but O

What O
do O
you O
mean O

because O
you O
were O
out O
sick O
or O

Well O
, O

I O
've O
been O
out O
all O
week O

and O
I O
said O
do O
I O
have O
any O
sick O
time O

she O
said O
I O
had O
seven B-TIME
hours I-TIME

and O
I O
said O
well O
just O
give O
me O
the B-TIME
seven I-TIME
hours I-TIME
of O
sick O
and O
that B-TIME
eight I-TIME
hours I-TIME
of O
holiday O
. O

So O
I O
have O
eight B-TIME
hours I-TIME
worth O
of O
pay O

that O
's O
it O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

I O
said O
do O
n't O
use O
my O
vacation O
time O
. O

She O
told O
me O
she O
had O
to O
. O

oh O
. O

Now O
, O
I O
have O
like O
two B-DATE
days I-DATE
left O
. O
uh-huh O

was O
going O
to O
cover O
me O
for O
at O

a O
couple B-DATE
days I-DATE
in I-DATE
August I-DATE
so O
I O
would O
n't O
like O
go O
without O
a O
check O

yeah O
. O

but O
they O
told O
me O
they O
had O
to O
pay O
me O
that B-TIME
sixteen I-TIME
hours I-TIME
of O
vacation O
time O
-- O
%huh O

which O
is O
mandatory O

I O
think O
stinks O

You O

, O

%hm O

n't O
wait O

to O
go O
to O
the O
library O
and O
basically O
box O
myself O
in O
like O
in O
one O
of O
those O
little O
cubicles O
and O
just O
read O
it O
and O
learn O
it O
that O
way O
. O

mhm O
. O

Because O
I O
ca O
n't O
really O
concentrate O
unless O
I O
'm O
totally O
away O
from O
things O
. O

yeah O
. O

Like O
I O
'm O
home O
and O
the O
T O
V O
is O
on O
in O
the O
other O
room O
I O
can O
hear O
it O
. O

Right O
. O

I O
need O
to O
be O
totally O
isolated O
and O
block O
everything O
out O
. O

mhm O
. O

That O
's O
the O
only O
way O
I O
can O
study O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
mean O
I O
ca O
n't O
even O
study O
if O
I O
'm O
with O
Patrick B-PERSON
because O
I O
'll O
sit O
I O
'll O
read O
stuff O

yeah O
. O

like O
I O
can O
read O
a O
book O

but O
I O
ca O
n't O
like O
study O
because O
I O
ca O
n't O
block O
everything O
out O

yeah O
. O

so O

So O
you O
guys O
are O
still O
seeing O
each O
other O
? O

yeah O
, O
it O
's O
weird O
because O
%um O
couple B-DATE
days I-DATE
after O
I O
wrote O
you O
**Mal** O
was O
really O
bummed O
out O
. O

yeah O

And O
we O
talked O
and O
stuff O

and O
%um O
I O
mean O
I O
told O
I O
miss O
him O

and O
I O
was O
crying O
on O
the O
phone O
. O

He O
was O
crying O
on O
the O
phone O
. O

mhm O
. O

Because O
I O
said O
are O
you O
going O
to O
miss O
me O
? O

He O
said O
well O
I O
miss O
you O
already O

and O
it O
was O
like O
you O
know O
why O
we O
doing O
this O
then O
. O

yeah O
. O

So O
I O
figured O
we O
'd O
%um O
-- O
-- O
take O
more O
time O
give O
him O
some O
more O
time O
and O
like O
evaluate O
in O
like O
six B-DATE
months I-DATE
like O
in O
October B-DATE
. O

mhm O
. O

So O
we O
've O
been O
seeing O
each O
other O
up O
until O

and O
you O
know O
we O
still O
have O
been O
seeing O
each O
other O

but O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
go O
to O
family O
things O
of O
his O
mhm O
. O
which O
is O
kind O
of O
weird O

and O
I O
'm O
like O

I O
wrote O
him O
a O
letter O
over O
this B-DATE
past I-DATE
week I-DATE
and O
told O
him O
-- O
-- O
how O
this O
is O
not O
enough O
you O
know O

I O
said O
you O
knew O
this O
was O
going O
to O
happen O
at O
some O
point O

you O
have O
to O
make O
a O
decision O

either O
you O
want O
us O
to O
be O
together O

or O
you O
do O
n't O
. O

yeah O
. O

you O
know O
my O
feelings O

and O
-- O
-- O
that O
's O
just O
the O
way O
it O
has O
to O
be O
. O

I O
said O
this O
is O
n't O
like O
it O
's O
a O
new O
relationship O
. O

We O
've O
known O
each O
other O
for O
ten B-DATE
years I-DATE

and O
we O
've O
gone O
through O
the O
good O
, O
bad O
, O
and O
the O
ugly O

yeah O
. O

and O
we O
were O
still O
here O
because O
we O
love O
each O
other O

so O
that O
should O
mean O
something O

or O
that O
should O
show O
you O
-- O
-- O
you O
know O

that O
should O
be O
significant O
somehow O
. O

mhm O
. O

I O
think O
it O
is O

but O
%um O
we O
're O
going O
to O
talk O
about O
some O
stuff O
on O
Friday B-DATE

and O
then O
we O
're O
spending O
the O
day O
together O
Sunday B-DATE
. O

Is O
he O
working O
now O
? O

No O
, O
in O
fact O
he O
got O
laid O
off O
. O

Did O
you O
know O
that O
? O

I O
think O
h- O

I O
'm O
not O
sure O
if O
he O
got O
laid O
off O
and O
was O
laid O
off O
when O
grandma O
died O
. O

I O
think O
he O
was O

yeah O
. O

I O
think O
he O
was O

but O
%um O
h- O

but O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
he O
was O
going O
to O
do O
something O
. O

Was O
he O
going O
to O
go O
to O

He O
had O
gotten O
some O
money O
for O
school O

yeah O
. O

so O
he O
took O
%um O
English B-LANGUAGE
Comp O
which O
he O
got O
an O
A O
minus O
in O
I O
believe O
because O
he O
's O
a O
really O
good O
writer O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

and O
he O
really O
writes O
from O
his O
soul O

%um O
and O
he O
's O
taking O
of O
all O
things O
Anatomy O
and O
Physiology O
which O
is O
the O
toughest O
thing O
he O
could O
take O

yeah O
I O
know O
I O
do O
n't O
ever O
want O
to O
take O
that O
and O
he O
's O
having O
a O
hard O
time O
with O
it O

but O
he O
's O
busting O
his O
butt O

I O
mean O
he O
's O
done O
some O
work O
and O
has O
gotten O
some O
really O
good O
grades O
and O
some O
just O
mediocre O
grades O

so O
he O
wanted O
to O
prove O
to O
himself O
that O
he O
could O
do O
it O

so O
he O
took O
the O
hardest O
thing O
he O
had O
to O
take O
forever O
. O

Next O
time O
he O
'll O
just O
be O
doing O
the O
A O
and O
P O
of O
the O
%um O
alcohol O
abusive O
person O
. O

mhm O
. O

So O
, O
he O
told O
me O
today O
he O
just O
got O
his O
test O
back O

he O
thought O
he O
did O
really O
well O

but O
he O
got O
a O
sixty O
eight O

and O
he O
's O
so O
ticked O
because O
he O
made O
some O
careless O
errors O

he O
-- O
skipped O
one B-CARDINAL
question O
and O
went O
on O
to O
the O
next O

but O
when O
he O
wrote O
%um O
the O
letters O
in O
, O
he O
put O
it O
on O
that O
particular O
one O

and O
then O
when O
he O
answered O
the O
other O
questions O
the O
other O
three B-CARDINAL
were O
just O
off O
because O
they O
were O
n't O
in O
the O
right O
spot O
. O

oh O

mhm O
. O

At O
the O
last O
four B-CARDINAL
which O
were O
right O
which O
he O
would O
have O
had O
credit O
for O
were O
wrong O
because O
he O
put O
them O
on O
the O
wrong O
space O
. O

Right O
. O

Right O
. O

and O
he O
was O
really O
ticked O
off O
at O
himself O
. O

is O
that O
passing O
? O

yeah O
sixty B-CARDINAL
eight I-CARDINAL
is O
passing O

I O
mean O
a O
D O
is O
passing O
. O

yeah O

well O
see O
there O
's O
different O
scales O
that O
people O
have O
mhm O
. O
for O
grades O

yeah O

and O
sometimes O
%uh O
you O
know O
like O
a O

I O
do O
n't O
know O

I O
do O
n't O
remember O
how O
it O
goes O

but O

It O
's O
passing O

but O
for O
some O
particular O
programs O
you O
have O
to O
have O
at O
least O
a O
C O
or O
better O
. O

mhm O
. O

So O
I O
was O
lucky O
I O
got O
a O
B O
in O
English B-LANGUAGE
Lit O

but O
that O
was O
like O
the O
first O
time O
I O
wrote O
a O
paper O
in O
like O
eight B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

Was O
that O
an O
interesting O
class O
? O

I O
liked O
it O

yeah O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
like O
the O
poetry O
. O
mhm O
. O
and O
having O
to O
analyze O
poetry O

but O
I O
liked O
English B-LANGUAGE
Literature O

I O
liked O
analyzing O
the O
stories O

yeah O
. O

I O
enjoyed O
that O
part O

and O
that O
part O
once O
I O
got O
the O
hang O
of O
it O
was O
okay O

yeah O
. O

and O
my O
first B-ORDINAL
paper O
I O
got O
a O
C O
on O

and O
I O
'd O
knew O
the O
story O
really O
well O
. O

It O
was O
intelligently O
written O

but O
I O
did O
n't O
like O
dig O
into O
it O

mhm O

and O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
paper O
I O
got O
a O
B O
minus O

and O
I O
never O
really O
liked O
the O
author O
of O
that O
story O
either O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
really O
understand O
the O
story O
so O
well O
. O

yeah O
. O

Called O
The B-WORK_OF_ART
Misfit I-WORK_OF_ART

I O
did O
n't O
like O
the O
author O
Flanner B-PERSON
O I-PERSON
'Connery I-PERSON
. O

oh O
. O

I O
've O
heard O
of O
him O
-- O

-- O
but O
I O
've O
never O
read O
anything O

%um O
and O
the O
third B-ORDINAL
one O
we O
did O
is O
Hamlet B-WORK_OF_ART
which O
I O
loved O
. O

I O
love O
Shakespeare B-PERSON
. O

%hm O
. O

So O
I O
had O
to O
write O
a O
paper O
on O
Hamlet B-WORK_OF_ART

Shakespeare B-PERSON
's O
hard O
to O
understand O
I O
think O
. O

It O
is O
because O
you O
have O
to O
keep O
going O
down O
to O
the O
footnotes O
and O
like O
learning O
what O
the O
words O
mean O
and O
stuff O

mhm O
. O

but O
we O
also O
watched O
the O
film O

I O
got O
the O
movie O
with O
Mel B-PERSON
Gibson I-PERSON

and O
oh O
I O
watched O
that O

yeah O
. O

and O
I O
really O
enjoy O
that O
kind O
of O
thing O

mhm O

so O
I O
wrote O
a O
good O
paper O

I O
made O
up O
my O
little O
poem O
at O
the O
end O
of O
it O
. O

and O
I O
got O
a O
B O
plus O
because O
I O
added O
more O
to O
it O
you O
know O
. O

yeah O
. O

it O
was O
really O
well O
- O
done O

I O
really O

and O
that O
was O
the O
easiest O
paper O
for O
me O
to O
write O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
it O
was O
because O
I O
had O
done O
two B-CARDINAL
before O
that O
or O
if O
I O
just O
really O
enjoyed O
the O
material O
I O
was O
working O
with O

yeah O
, O

that O
helps O
. O

but O
I O
got O
a O
really O
good O
grade O
on O
that O

and O
I O
got O
a O
B O
on O
the O
course O

but O

I O
worked O
really O
hard O
for O
it O

and O
it O
was O
n't O
easy O
. O
yeah O
. O
You O
know O

and O
then O
for O
Psych O
and O
Soc O
I O
got O
three O
A's O
on O
my O
test O
for O

And O
then O

A O
. O

%hm O
. O

and O
then O
%um O
I O

final O
next B-DATE

so O
it O
's O
a O

of O
work O
. O

You O
going O
to O

History O
mhm O
. O
or O
take O
a O
philosophy O
and O
maybe O

n't O
even O
know O
if O
I O
even O
want O
to O
tackle O
a O
Spanish B-LANGUAGE
yet O

yeah O
. O

I O
have O
to O
have O
a O
language O

but O
I O
do O
n't O
really O
know O
if O
I O
really O
want O
to O
do O
it O
now O

I O
think O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
take O
it O

do O
you O
guys O
have O
tele O
courses O
? O

Do O
you O
know O
what O
those O
are O
? O

What O
are O
they O
? O

Tele O
courses O
. O

It O
's O
like O
you O
get O
a O
video O

mhm O
. O

and O
you O
just O
you O
know O
watch O
the O
video O
at O
home O

mhm O
. O

and O
you O
do O
the O
reading O
and O
the O
work O
and O
stuff O
at O
home O

and O
then O
you O
go O
in O
however O
so O
often O
they O
have O
a O
schedule O
set O
up O
to O
the O
school O
and O
take O
your O
test O
. O

oh O
really O
? O

It O
's O
like O
in O
a O
testing O
center O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

Wow O
. O

And O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
try O
that O
since O
I O
took O
you O
know O
a O
lot O
of O
French B-LANGUAGE
in O
High O
School O

yeah O
. O

I O
thought O
maybe O
it O
wo O
n't O
be O
too O
hard O
-- O
%huh O
. O
-- O
to O
do O
it O
that O
way O

I O
'm O
going O
to O
try O
and O
take O
it O
. O

that O
would O
be O
interesting O
. O

yeah O
, O

because O
we O
did O
a O
%um O
-- O
we O
'll O
see O
. O
-- O
study O
evaluation O
on O
us O
. O

We O
had O
to O
write O
down O
on O
Psychology O

and O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
I O
'm O
a O
what O
do O
you O
call O
it O
? O
something O
observer O
. O
reflective O
observer O
when O
I O
study O
. O

mhm O
. O

When O
I O
do O
things O
kind O
of O
like O
sit O
back O
and O
watch O
the O
stuff O

and O
yeah O
. O
I O
could O
be O
very O
quiet O
in O
the O
class O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
really O
participate O
a O
lot O
in O
the O
class O
. O

when O
I O
pay O
attention O
I O
'm O
always O
there O

mhm O
. O

but O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
say O
a O
lot O
of O
stuff O

yeah O
. O

Not O
in O
the O
Psychology O
class O
I O
do O
n't O
. O

I O
just O
do O
n't O
feel O
comfortable O
with O
it O
like O
with O
the O
people O
that O
are O
in O
there O

yeah O

so O
I O
listen O

so O
I O
know O
everything O

I O
comprehend O
everything O

I O
know O
it O

but O

Is O
there O
younger O
students O
in O

or O
just O
are O
they O
mostly O
adults O

or O
? O

%um O
there O
's O
a O
mix O
. O

There O
some O
like O
nineteen B-CARDINAL
twenty B-DATE
year I-DATE
old I-DATE

yeah O
. O

and O
there O
's O
some O
married O
women O
in O
there O

an O
older O
woman O
mhm O
. O
and O
then O
younger O
kids O
. O

There O
's O
a O
couple O
black O
people O
in O
there O

yeah O
, O
that O
sounds O
about O
You O
know O
it O
's O
a O
good O
mix O
like O
what O
it O
is O
here O

yeah O

but O
it O
seems O
like O
this O
kid O
who O

I O
'm O
not O
saying O

oh O
I O
hope O
I O
'm O
not O
being O
prejudice O

but O
he O
's O
black O

and O
he O
's O
like O
always O
questioning O
the O
teachers O
and O
stuff O

and O
he O
thinks O
like O
well O
if O
you O
were O
told O
that O
you O
were O
brought O
up O
in O
a O
house O
you O
do O
what O
he O
says O
you O
know O

that O
's O
okay O
to O
learn O
that O
and O
stuff O

and O
that O
's O
okay O
to O
do O
to O
your O
kid O

and O
she O
's O
trying O
to O
teach O
him O
that O
it O
's O
not O
okay O
to O
do O
that O

mhm O

that O
's O
not O
how O
you O
build O
someone O
self O
- O
respect O
and O
to O
do O
things O
like O
that O

and O
it O
's O
like O
a O
couple O
people O
like O
to O
argue O
with O
her O

and O
like O
they O
think O
teachers O
are O
really O
ignorant O
and O
stupid O
you O
know O

well O
she O
got O
to O
be O
the O
teacher O

she O
must O
have O
done O
something O
. O

but O
yeah O
. O

%um O
but O
it O
's O
good O

I O
mean O
it O
's O
been O
interesting O
. O

They O
had O
a O
hypnotist O
come O
in O
the O
other O
day O

but O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
do O
it O
just O
because O
I O
was O
skeptical O
of O
it O
and O
not O
really O
%um O
enthusiastic O
about O
it O

yeah O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
feel O
comfortable O

like O
I O
was O
more O
interested O
in O

great O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O

could O
there O
be O
a O
reason O
for O
that O
? O

There O
could O
be O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
it O
is O
. O

It O
could O
be O
a O
lens O
does O
n't O
adjust O
well O

I O
'm O

Because O
it O
's O
always O
the O
outdoor O
pictures O
. O

right O

this O

I O
took O
a O
lot O
of O
outdoor O

not O
all O
bad O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

oh O
really O
? O

yeah O

maybe O
it O
's O
%huh O
could O
be O
the O
how O
you O
face O
the O
sun O

yeah O

and O
also O
I O
think O
the O
more O
bright O
the O
sun O
is O
the O
fuzzier O
it O
comes O
out O
for O
some O
reason O
. O

could O
be O
when O
it O
's O
too O
bright O
it O
just O
does O
n't O
handle O
it O

yeah O

mhm O

okay O

how O
are O
the O
real O
ones O

good O

go O
enjoy O
. O

Anybody O
coming O
? O

how O
are O
the O
real O
ones O

just O
great O

yummy O
? O

I O
decided O
for O
a B-TIME
half I-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME
I O
can O
tell O
you O
all O
the O
that O
do O
n't O
come O
out O
on O
the O
letter O

One B-TIME
minute I-TIME

your O
little O
daughter O
she O
's O

Which O
one O
? O

very O

the O
little O
one O
very O

yeah O

oh O
yes O

Excuse O
me O
. O
Today O
she O
colored O
up O
the O
walls O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
used O
to O
looking O
out O
for O
her O

and O
there O
she O
is O
with O
a O
red O
crayon O
being O

oh O

Well O
, O
what O
gives O
you O
that O
idea O
? O

The O
look O
in O
her O
eyes O

She O
is O
quite O

very O
mischievous O
looking O
very O

you O
have O
%huh O

this O
is O
quite O

Brachalov B-PERSON
got O
up O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night O

yeah O

and O
she O
was O
wet O

yeah O

yeah O
so O
she O
tells O
me O
she O
's O
all O
wet O
. O

So O
we O
have O
to O
take O
off O
the O
pajamas O

so O
she O
tells O
me O
put O
them O
in O
the O
sun O
. O

In O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night O
? O

yeah O

So O
it O
's O
not O
like O
you O
know O

I O
see O
that O
she O
takes O
the O
knowledge O
that O
she O
picks O
up O
in O
one O
place O
and O
she O
applies O
it O
in O
another O
place O
. O

uh-huh O

I O
think O
one O
of O
the O
most O
intelligent O
things O
she O
's O
said O
so O
far O
is O
one O
time O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
no O
place O
, O
we O
never O
discussed O
it O
or O
anything O
says O
to O
me O
Poppy O
pants O
mommy O
skirt O

oh O
she O
figured O
that O
out O
. O

I O
thought O
that O
was O
pretty O
intelligent O

What O
else O
does O
she O
say O
? O

The O
other O
day O
she O
's O
telling O

%uh O
Sarah B-PERSON
's O
her O
doll O
so O
she O
says O
Sarah O

want O
to O
go O

the O
store O
? O

Come O
into O
the O
carriage O
. O

Come O

we O
're O
going O
to O
the O
store O
. O

okay O

come O

good O
Sarah B-PERSON
. O

and O
then O
you O
felt O
like O
you O
were O
hearing O
a O
tape O
recording O
of O
yourself O
. O

Very O
much O
%uh O
very O
much O

like O
it O
makes O
you O
really O
be O
careful O

yeah O

uh-huh O

%eh O

where O
's O
Sarah B-PERSON
's O
bottle O

do O
n't O

then O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
every O
time O
I O
'm O
about O
to O
answer O
I O
realize O
how O
many O
times O
I O
really O
was O
about O
to O
say O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

mhm O

Like O
if O
she O
'll O
ask O
me O
where O
are O
the O
crayons O
. O
Instead O
of O
saying O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
I O
'll O
say O
%hm O
well O
let O
's O
look O
for O
them O
because O
she O
parrots O
back O
at O
me O
I O
do O
n't O
know O

I O
do O
n't O
know O

a O
shampoo O

herbal O
oils O

you O
put O
it O
into O
a O
squeeze O
bottle O
of O

What O

You O
take O
some O

So O
the O
shampoo O
that O
they O
have O
has O
Rosemarin O
oil O
in O
it O
. O

yeah O

that O
's O
the O
one O
that O
's O
supposed O
to O
be O
most O
effective O
. O

To O
prevent O
? O

yeah O
I O
also O
have O

%um O
%uh O
you O
can O
rub O
it O
behind O
their O
ears O

oh O
thank O
you O

She O
said O
it O

How O
does O
she O

Because O
a O
whole O

. O

uh-huh O

why O

it O
's O
a O
big O
problem O
in O
Lakewood B-GPE
? O

yeah O

Really O

yeah O

Once O
it O
's O
a O
problem O
It O
keeps O
going O
ring O
around O
the O
rosie O

That O
's O
right O
because O
it O
's O
so O
difficult O

From O
A O
to O
B O
to O
C O
to O
D O
to O
E O

and O
then O
it O
goes O
back O
to O
A O

Right O

I O
sometimes O
feel O
like O
I O
want O

keep O
it O
under O

make O

that O
every O

work O
so O
hard O
? O

So O
this O
is O
supposed O

You O
know O
to O
keep O
it O
under O
control O
is O
one O
thing O

all O
right O

so O
this O
is O
the O

she O
said O
the O
kids O
love O
it O

it O
smells O
nice O
. O

I O
hope O
so O

oh O
good O
. O

okay O

a O
try O
that O
's O
for O
sure O

An- O

Right O

Remopolin B-PERSON
Mikhail I-PERSON
and O

Chanamalka B-PERSON

Farrach B-PERSON
's O
sisters O
they O

So O
they O
wanted O
to O
see O
Remopolin B-PERSON

that O
's O
like O
you O
know O
tourist O
attraction O

uh-huh O

So O
I O
met O
them O
in O
a O
park O
in O

and O
we O
had O
a O
a O
nice O
afternoon O
together O
. O

uh-huh O

oh O
very O
nice O

Very O
nice O

I O
have O
n't O
see O
her O
kids O
in O
over O
a O
year O
. O

uh-huh O

for O
sure O
I O
have O
n't O
seen O
her O
Channa O

she O
has O
a O
Channa O
Sarah B-PERSON

yeah O

I O
have O
n't O

and O
I O

yeah O

she O
wanted O
to O
name O
her O
Sarah B-PERSON

but O
she O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
too O
confusing O
Sarah B-PERSON
Sarah B-PERSON
Chimalback I-PERSON

so O
she O
named O
her O
Channa O
Sarah B-PERSON

yeah O

uh-huh O

I O
see O

So O
she O
was O
born O
last O
Shavuos B-EVENT
%eh O
%mm O
you O
know O
%uh O
the B-DATE
year I-DATE
and I-DATE
some I-DATE
ago I-DATE

and O
I O
never O
saw O
her O

uh-huh O

So O
anyway O

Your O
brothers O
are O
working O
hard O
in O
day O
camp O
? O

oh O

oh O
yeah O

but O
then O
they O
're O
also O
enjoying O
it O
. O

oh O
good O

That O
's O
what O
they O
said O
anyway O
. O

You O
could O
ask O
them O
. O

okay O

%um O
I O
wanted O
to O
ask O
you O
did O
they O

you O
know O
you O
have O
this O
lazy O
susan O
in O
your O
cabinet O

yeah O

Is O
that O
a O
common O
item O

do O
they O
still O
sell O
them O
? O

It O
's O
a O
Rubbermaid B-ORG

yeah O

yeah O

you O
want O
one B-CARDINAL
or O
two B-CARDINAL
? O

probably O
Tupperware B-ORG
sells O
it O
also O
. O

who O

I O
was O
thinking O
Tupperware B-ORG
probably O
also O
sells O
it O
no O

I O
do O
n't O
recall O
seeing O
it O
Tupperware B-ORG

but O
maybe O

uh-uh O

if O
they O
have O
like O
a O
two B-CARDINAL
- O
tiered O
one O
yeah O
because O
that O
would O
save O
a O
lot O
of O
space O

and O
you O
know O
my O
cabinets O
are O
very O
high O

and O
things O
are O
always O

I O
think O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
that O
I O
have O
is O
a O
two B-CARDINAL
- O
tier O
that O
I O
took O
apart O
. O

oh O
really O

yeah O

because O
the O
shelves O
are O
relat- O
%eh O
%uh O

oh O

your O
shelves O
are O
high O
? O

not O
so O
high O

but O
yeah O
they O
're O
pretty O
high O
one O
from O
the O
other O
. O

yeah O

And O
so O
what O
happens O
is O
to O
maximize O
the O
space O
everything O
's O
jumbled O
on O
top O
of O
everything O
else O

uh-huh O

okay O

I O
can O
look O

and O
then O
it O
's O
behind O

and O
it O
's O
very O
far O

it O
's O
just O
i- O

whatever O

yeah O

all O
right O

okay O

and O
so O
I O
wanted O
to O
ask O
you O
do O
you O
go O
to O
these O
secondhand O
stores O
some O
or O
you O
go O
only O
when O
you O
have O
a O
free O
. O

Sometimes O

What O

Brecha B-PERSON
could O
use O
some O
winter O
jumpers O

jump O

She O
has O
polo O
shirts O

jumpers O

because O
she O
has O
polo O
shirts O
galore O

I O
always O
look O
for O
jumpers O

but O
it O
's O
not O
a O
common O
thing O
because O
most O
kids O
wear O
pants O

I O

yeah O

sometimes O
Osh B-ORG
Kosh I-ORG
makes O

If O
they O
have O
it O

oh O
yeah O

I O
got O
one O
nice O
one O

my O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
Mindy B-PERSON
when O
Sarah B-PERSON
was O
born O
gave O
me O
a O
very O
nice O
blue O
yeah O
uh-huh O
standard O
I O
think O
it O
's O
Osh B-ORG
Kosh I-ORG
stuff O
%um O
jumper O

so O
she O
has O
a O
ton O
of O
polo O
shirts O
because O
the O
ones O
from O
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
still O
fit O
her O
. O

oh O
uh-huh O

so O
you O
know O
I O

you O
were O
like O
that O

you O
did O
n't O
get O
wider O
on O
top O

uh-huh O

well O
I O
was O
a O
little O
kid O

you O
had O
a O
dress O
that O
Oma O
bought O
you O

and O
you O
kept O
growing O

but O
it O
did O
n't O
get O
tight O
on O
you O
on O
top O
. O

So O
finally O
I O
made O
it O
into O
a O
dropped O
waist O
dre- O

it O
was O
a O
blue O
dress O
with O
a O
white O
ruffle O
. O

I O
bought O
a O
blue O
and O
white O
checkered O
piece O
of O
material O

and O
I O
made O
a O
drop O

oh O
and O
you O
made O
a O
skirt O

It O
was O
a O
dropped O
waist O
dress O

and O
a O
ho- O

Well O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
see O
an- O

What O

I O
was O
saying O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
see O
any O
sisters O
in O
sight O
so O
you O
could O
you O
know O

right O

no O
sisters O

this O
is O
another O
one O
of O
your O
latest O
so O
what O
for O
let O
her O
wear O
it O

Exactly O

but O
I O
was O
n't O
ready O
to O
give O
up O
this O
nice O
dress O
yet O
. O

this O
dress O

uh-huh O

you O
know O
I O
called O
Chayita B-PERSON
yesterday O

and O
I O
said O
if O
anybody O
knows O
about O
this O
deal O
probably O
she O
does O
because O
you O
told O
me O
Mrs. O
Rubin B-PERSON

Her O
mother O
told O
me O
about O
it O

Right O
, O

but O
she O
did O
n't O
know O
anything O
about O
it O

I O
was O
sure O
she O
spoke O
to O
her O
mother O
for O
a B-TIME
half I-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME
last B-DATE
week I-DATE

Her O
mother O
did O
n't O
call O
her O
? O

and O
she O
does O
n't O
know O
anything O
about O
it O
. O

%huh O

So O
what O
's O
the O
whole O
idea O

what O
are O
they O
trying O
to O

They O
're O
studying O
l- O

%eh O
it O
's O
for O
educational O
purposes O
. O

meaning O
do O
I O
sound O
educated O
? O

no O

Too O
bad O
I O
'm O
not O
going O
back O
to O
school O
. O

It O
's O
too O
bad O
. O

Well O
you O
go O
every O
day O
. O

I O
'd O

I O
mean O
I O
guess O
it O
just O
totally O
makes O
sense O
that O
they O
do O
because O
that O
's O
just O
not O
something O
I O
think O
of O
Iranians O
doing O
is O
making O
films O
. O

Gassing O
Kurds O
and O
shooting O
Iraqis O

yeah O

that O
makes O
sense O
that O
they O
do O
that O
. O

Well O
, O
that O
's O
a O
different O
kind O
of O
Iranians O
, O
I O
imagine O
. O

Which O
I O
think O
Nassir O
's O
more O
Persian O

but O
it O
's O
the O
same O
area O

then O
it O
became O
Iran O
later O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
back O
at O
the O
ranch O

I O
thought O
about O
that O
the O
other O
day O
. O

%ha O
I O
use O
that O
all O
the O
time O
, O
still O
. O

It O
's O
kind O
of O
amusing O
. O

Things O
never O
change O
. O

Yes O
, O
they O
do O

Regardless O

So O
what O
's O
happening O
with O
you O
and O
Sharon O
? O

Well O
, O
we O
are O
here O
in O
Italy O
. O
mhm O
In O
Villa O
Verla O
which O
is O
this O
little O
, O
basically O
nowhere O
town O
about O
half O
an O

from O

. O

and O
%uh O

look O
out O
the O

That O

it O
's O
really O
nice O

nice O
dinner O

'll O
come O
to O
clean O
the O
bathroom O
every O
week O
you O
know O
-- O
Right O
-- O
deal O
with O
the O
mundane O
things O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
handle O
well O
-- O
yeah O
-- O
you O
know O
on O
a O
regular O
basis O
when O
I O
start O
feeling O
overloaded O
although O
I O
have O
n't O

it O
's O
so O
much O
easier O
than O
undergrad O
for O
me O
. O

I O
'm O
sorry O

It O
could O
n't O
have O
been O
much O
more O
difficult O
. O

I O
'm O
pretty O
much O
just O
taking O
it O
easy O
. O

that O
's O
cool O

Studying O
a O
bit O
here O
. O

Going O
out O
and O
doing O
stuff O

Watching O
Iranian O
films O

I O
'm O
not O
watching O
them O
. O

Nassir O
is O

oh O
you O
're O
not O
going O
to O
watch O
Iranian O
films O
? O
No O
. O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
see O
my O
friend O
, O
Molly O
and O
some O
other O
Earlham O
friends O
. O

%ah O

I O

Well O
I O
'm O
sort O
of O
disappointed O

I O
wanted O
you O
to O
tell O
me O
what O
Iranian O
film O
was O
like O

but O
you O
can O
ask O
Nassir O
. O

Actually O
this O
week O
he O
told O
me O
%um O
it O
's O
a O
movie O
about O
this O
woman O
who O
I O
think O
was O
a O
nurse O
and O
actually O
did O
a O
lot O
of O
work O
and O
did O
a O
lot O
of O
good O
stuff O

but O
then O
when O
she O
got O
married O
her O
mother O
- O
in O
- O
law O
is O
very O
traditional O

and O
so O
she O
stopped O
working O
because O
it O
was O
making O
her O
husband O
unhappy O

right O

and O
then O
there O
was O
%um O
some O
kind O
of O
disaster O
that O
had O
happened O
a O
plague O
or O
something O
I O
think O

and O
so O
she O
brought O
her O
skills O
back O
out O
into O
the O
open O
and O
cures O
people O
and O
does O
really O
good O
things O

and O
so O
it O
gets O
into O
%um O
some O
of O
the O
problems O
of O
traditional O
society O
and O
roles O
of O
women O
sort O
of O
pro-feminist O
kind O
of O
stuff O

Sounded O
neat O
to O
me O
. O

It O
's O
one O
I O
would O
watch O

yeah O

cool O

Last O
film O
I O
watched O
was O
Star O
Wars O

Bought O
it O
on O
video O
tape O
. O

Twelve O
ninety O
- O
five O
. O

Pretty O
cool O
. O

yeah O
. O

Well O
wh- O

Not O
exactly O
deep O
culture O
, O
though O
. O

, O
well O
, O
it O
's O
very O
cultural O
. O

It O
is O
yeah O
very O
pop O
culture O

Pop O
culture O

Well O
you O
know O
why O
they O
re-released O
them O
for O
the O
last O
time O
, O
right O
? O

yeah O

because O
they O
're O
coming O
out O
with O
the O
new O
ones O
. O

Well O
not O
only O
that O
. O

They O
're O
redoing O
parts O
of O
the O
old O
ones O
. O

I O
guess O
I O
'd O
heard O
something O
about O
they O
're O
going O
to O
do O
like O
computer O
graphics O
or O
something O
like O
that O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

They O
're O
redoing O
parts O
of O
it O
I O
think O
to O
help O
fit O
in O
with O
the O
new O
one O
. O

And O
so O
that O
way O
they O
get O
two O
major O
sales O
of O
the O
three O
video O
tapes O

Seems O
like O
a O
pretty O
good O
deal O
to O
me O
. O

I O
'll O
buy O
them O
. O

I O
'll O
help O
. O

I O
'll O
support O
that O
part O
of O
the O
economy O

Support O
your O
culture O

Your O
taxpayers O
' O
dollars O
at O
work O

Star O
Wars O

yeah O

three O
of O
them O
twice O

try O
that O
. O

It O
's O
**icky** O

yeah O

it O
is O
**icky** O

It O
's O
pure O
sugar O
and O
**ick** O
sugar O
and O
**ick** O

I O
ca O
n't O
eat O
that O
stuff O

I O
'm O
getting O
old O
, O
Rebecca O

oh O

I O
'm O
an O
old O
man O

No O
, O

you O
're O
younger O
than O
I O
am O

I O
creak O
when O
I O
get O
out O
of O
bed O
in O
the O
morning O

ooh O
my O
knees O
crack O
. O

That O
's O
the O
thing O
that O
bothers O
me O
. O

yeah O

anyway O
What O
are O
tho- O

okay O
the O
big O
question O
. O

okay O
. O

are O
you O
going O
to O
be O
back O
in O
this O
country O
any O
time O
? O

whew O
no O
time O
soon O

Just O
though O
you O
might O
come O
home O
for O
Christmas O
or O
something O
. O

Nope O
, O

not O
a O
chance O
. O

%mm O

we O
have O
what O
's O
called O
a O
I O
R O
F O
which O
is O
the O
Initial O
Reaction O
Force O

Turns O
out O
that O
the O
battalion O
I O
'm O
in O
is O
the O
only O
American O
airborne O
in O
fact O
the O
only O
light O
forces O
i.e. O
we O
do O
n't O
have O
big O
tanks O
and O
shit O
in O
Europe O
. O

And O
so O
if O
anything O
really O
really O
bad O
happens O
they O
will O
deploy O
us O
first O
because O
we O
're O
easy O
to O
move O
. O

yeah O
, O

I O
'd O
deploy O
you O
. O

You O
're O
easy O
. O

and O
%uh O
I O
've O
always O
said O
that O

I O
know O
it O
. O

%uh O
So O
we O
rotate O
responsibility O
in O
the O
battalion O
on O
who O
's O
on O
basically O
a O
four O
hour O
alert O
. O

Need O
to O
be O
there O
with O
all O
your O
gear O
in O
four O
hours O

and O
during O
Christmas O
, O
I O
'll O
be O
on O
it O
. O

So O
I O
ai O
n't O
going O
nowhere O
. O

%ah O

oh O
well O

You O
know O
one O
of O
these O
day- O

Should O
come O
to O
Italy O

Yes O
I O
should O
, O
in O
fact O
. O

When O
I O
have O
money O
again O
. O

I O
've O
been O
spending O
more O
than O
I O
ever O
have O
before O
lately O
. O

Probably O
have O
more O
than O
you O
've O
ever O
had O
before O
lately O
. O

Well O
yeah O
. O

yeah O
. O

there O
you O
go O
. O

Now O
what O
's O
the O
size O
of O
it O
compared O
to O
the O
other O
place O
because O
now O
I O
remember O
that O

The O
size O
of O
the O
classrooms O
yeah O
%um O
maybe O
two B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
thirds I-CARDINAL
as O
big O

mhm O
mhm O

But O
see O
I O
have O
fewer O
children O
too O

oh O
that O
's O
good O

how O
many O

About O
twenty B-CARDINAL
or O
twenty B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL
. O

oh O
that O
's O
good O
. O

mhm O
smallest O
class O
in O
the O
school O
. O

%mm O

They O
range O
I O
think O
from O
my O
twenty B-CARDINAL
to O
up O
about B-CARDINAL
thirty I-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL

And O
what O
grade O
is O
it O
again O
? O

Third B-ORDINAL
. O

okay O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
like O
to O
pass O
thirty B-CARDINAL

but O
I O
think O
the O
seventh B-ORDINAL
grade O
has O
thirty B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL
. O

uh-huh O
. O

And O
they O
might O
not O
all O
show O
up O
either O
. O

You O
know O
you O
never O
can O
tell O
with O
people O
like O
that O

Right O
. O

Right O
. O

So O
we O
shall O
see O
. O

oh O
. O

Well O
I O
'm O
glad O
you O
have O
a O
smaller O
number O
now O
. O

oh O

and O
it O
's O
all O
one B-CARDINAL
grade O
. O

all O
one B-CARDINAL
grade O

it O
's O

Tammy B-PERSON
you O
almost O
wo O
n't O
know O
what O
to O
do O
with O
yourself O

oh O
I O
think O
I O
'll O
find O
many O
a O
thing O
to O
do O
somehow O

oh O
oh O
gosh O

so O
have O
you O
seen O
any O
other O
teachers O
? O

oh O
yes O

%um O
see O
when O
the O
principal O
was O
away O
two B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
men O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
grade O
teacher O
John B-PERSON
McCall I-PERSON
who O
's O
a O
lovely O
gentleman O
and O
the O
computer O
teacher O
Mr. O
Deverow B-PERSON
covered O
the O
office O
for O
the O
principal O

%hm O
%hm O

I O
see O
. O

So O
John B-PERSON
McCall I-PERSON
was O
doing O
it O
%uh O
last B-DATE
week I-DATE

and O
Mr. O
Deverow B-PERSON
was O
doing O
it O
the O
week O
before O
that O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

So O
they O
were O
very O
helpful O
. O

Now O
will O
your O
class O
have O
much O
opportunity O
to O
use O
the O
computers O
? O

oh O
yes O

once O
a O
week O
they O
go O
up O
uh-huh O
. O
For O
forty B-TIME
- I-TIME
five I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
. O

I O
have O
three B-CARDINAL
computers O
in O
my O
classroom O
. O

Do O
you O
? O

Yes O

every O
classroom O
has O
two B-CARDINAL
or O
three B-CARDINAL
. O
mhm O
. O

oh O

mhm O

hey O
that O
's O
good O
. O

yeah O

it O
's O
great O
. O

%eh O
they O
're O
real O
old O
you O
know O
the O
ones O
in O
the O
room O

they O
're O
like O
%um O
uh-huh O
. O
the O
old O
Commodores B-PRODUCT
I O
think O

%mm O
. O

but O
they O
're O
I B-PRODUCT
B I-PRODUCT
M I-PRODUCT
compatible O
. O

That O
's O
good O

and O
so O
like O
what O
program O
is O
in O
it O

what O
will O
you O
use O
it O
for O
? O

mhm O

Well O
I O
think O
what O
he O
's O
done O

see O
Mr. O
Deverow B-PERSON
makes O
these O
discs O
uh-huh O
to O
go O
with O
your O
work O

oh O
. O

So O
if O
you O
want O
something O
on O
you O
know O
addition O
of O
facts O
up O
to O
nine B-CARDINAL
, O
he O
'll O
have O
a O
disc O
that O
you O
can O
use O
to O
reinforce O
those O
skills O

Really O
. O

Yes O
, O

he O
's O
done O
that O
. O

hey O
that O
's O
great O
. O

he O
's O
been O
there O
twenty B-DATE
- I-DATE
five I-DATE
years I-DATE
they O
say O

Really O
. O

yeah O

so O
he O
has O
spent O
many O
many O
hours O
just O
making O
discs O
for O
the O
teachers O
. O

That O
's O
fantastic O

mhm O

and O
we O
have O
an O
art O
teacher O
, O
a O
music O
teacher O
, O
and O
a O
gym O
teacher O
Wow O
. O
And O
a O
fulltime O
librarian O
plus O
an O
assistant O
librarian O
who O
's O
a O
Sister O
. O
My O
goodness O
. O
A O
Benedictine O
Sister O

so O
you O
do O
get O
three B-CARDINAL
forty B-TIME
minute I-TIME
periods O
well O
about O
three B-CARDINAL
half B-TIME
- I-TIME
hour I-TIME
periods O
by O
the O
time O
you O
take O
them O
and O
bring O
them O
back O
a O
week O

Yes O

right O

right O
. O

%mm O
. O

but O
I O
think O
you O
also O
have O
to O
stay O
with O
the O
children O
all O
during O
lunch O
and O
recess O

oh O
so O
that O
's O
a O
trade O
- O
off O

I O
think O
you O
need O
that B-TIME
forty I-TIME
minutes I-TIME

So O
when O
do O
you O
get O
your O
lunch O

you O
eat O
with O
them O
? O

Well O
I O
think O
you O
eat O
with O
them O
as O
far O
as O
I O
know O

do O
they O
eat O
in O
their O
room O

is O
that O
it O
? O

In O
the O
classroom O
yes O
as O
far O
as O
I O
know O
. O

aw O
gee O

aw O
gee O
. O

And O
I O
hate O
that O
. O

I O
hate O
to O
have O
food O
in O
the O
room O
I O
do O
too O
yeah O
. O
Because O
it O
makes O
animals O

but O
however O

oh O
dear O

well O
speaking O
of O
animals O
remember O
the O
fleas O
we O
had O
at O
Immaculate B-FAC
Conception I-FAC
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
that O
I O
was O
telling O
you O
about O
? O

Yes O

yeah O
. O

They O
're O
back O
again O
. O

At O
Immaculate B-FAC
Conception I-FAC

oh O

At O
Immaculate B-FAC
Conception I-FAC

Carol B-PERSON
Anne I-PERSON
said O
she O
was O
eaten O
alive O
the O
other O
day O

no O

oh O

And O
Valerie B-PERSON
was O
over O
there O
helping O
her O
with O
something O
on O
the O
computer O

yeah O
. O

Valerie B-PERSON
came O
home O

she O
had O
welts O
all O
over O
her O
whole O
legs O

uh-oh O

I O
said O
where O
were O
you O
today O
? O

She O
said O
Immaculate B-FAC
Conception I-FAC

I O
said O
they O
're O
fleas O

oh O
. O

No O
she O
said O

no O

yes O
they O
are O
Valerie B-PERSON

oh O
. O

So O
Carol B-PERSON
Anne I-PERSON
had O
to O
get O
the O
exterminator O
to O
put O
the O
bombs O
in O
the O
rooms O
again O
. O

oh O
my O
goodness O

They O
closed O
everything O
up O
on O
Friday B-DATE

and O
they O
bombed O
out O
the O
whole O
place O
for O
the O
weekend O

oh O

But O
how O
did O
they O
come O
back O

I O
guess O
all O
the O
eggs O
stay O
in O
the O
rug O

is O
that O
it O
? O

Well O
I O
do O
n't O
know O

I O
guess O
they O
do O

but O
that O
's O
a O
long O
time O
incubating O

I O
mean O
you O
did O
n't O
have O
them O
through O
the O
entire O
year O

and O
then O

yeah O

no O

we O
did O
n't O
have O
them O
again O
unless O
they O
come O
in O
the O
windows O
in O
the O
summer O
. O

%mm O

See O
that O
could O
be O
it O
. O

yeah O

maybe O
there O
's O
some O
way O
And O
they O
infest O
the O
rugs O
Because O
there O
are O
no O
animals O
around O
there O
right O
? O

Animals O
? O

No O

no O
dogs O
or O
cats O
or O
raccoons O

right O

like O
that O

**luch** O

I O
've O
never O
seen O
any O

So O
I O
have O

Hanging O

%um O
that O
's O
awful O
. O

Like O
six O

The O
only O
sleep O
I O
'll O
have O
gotten O
is O
on O
the O
plane O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

And O
then O
Sunday O
night O
I O
'm O
taking O
a O
redeye O
which B-DATE
leaves I-DATE
At O
at O
eleven O
fifteen O

P O
M O
? O

%uh O
, O
Chicago O
at O
four O
fifty O
- O
seven B-DATE

eleven O
fifteen O

the O

, O
honestly O
. O

Is O
this O
the O
one O
that O
goes O

Washington O
? O

%um O
, O
no O
Chicago O
and O
then O
Syracuse O
. O

387.98_388.72_A: O
oh O
that O
's O
nice O
. O

my O
original O
one O
went O
to O
Washington O
and O
then O
Syra- O

Maybe O
you O
should O
take O
that O
one O
, O
though O
, O
because O
it O
comes O
earlier O
, O
does O
n't O
it O
? O

No O
, O
it O
was O
n't O
an O
option O
for O
some O
reason O

oh O
. O

Maybe O
it O
was O
full O
or O
something O
. O

%um O
, O
but O
still O
, O
you O
know O
, O
maybe O
you O
should O
just O
get O
on O
the O
next O
plane O
, O
instead O
of O
waiting O
around O
for O
Ted O
. O

You O
'll O

time O
he O
gets O
there O
. O

You O
would O
. O

yeah O
. O

yeah O
. O

Well O
maybe O
not O
because O
if O
connections O
, O
ca O
n't O
go O
direct O
. O

Whine O
. O

%um O
, O
but O
you O
're O
going O
to O
go O
mountain O
biking O
? O

Maybe B-CARDINAL
. O

That O
would O
be O
fun O
. O

Does O
he O
have O
a O
mountain O
bike O
for O
you O
? O

yeah O

Does O
he O
? O

Well O
apparently O
, O
because O
he O
offered O
. O

Because O
he O
offered O

yeah O
. O

And O
I O
would O
imagine O
that O
he O
would O
know O
that O
you O
're O
not O
travelling O
around O
with O
your O
bicycle O
. O

Right O
. O

And O
that O
you O
do O
n't O
get O
to O
keep O
yours O
as O
a O
souvenir O
. O

Right O
. O

Or O
anything O
fun B-CARDINAL
like O
that O
. O

437.08_438.30_B: O
it O
's O
not O
a O
mountain O
bike O
. O

not O
a O
mountain O
bike O

. O

No O
, O

and O
in O
some O
of O
your O
letters O
it O
sounds O
like O
you O
would O
n't O
really O
want O
to O
keep O
it O
, O
really O
. O

Just O

I O
did O
go O
up O
a O
mountain O
on O
it O
. O

But O

%huh O
? O

I O
did O
go O
up O
a O
mountain O

have O
**ouchies** O

yeah O
. O

And O
I O
, O

yeah O

I O
explained B-CARDINAL
a O
little O
bit O
. O
Trying O
%um O
very O
hard O
not O
to O
be O
silly O
. O

it O
's O
very O
difficult O
to O
explain O
this O
with O
any B-CARDINAL
kind O
of O
straight O
face O

Really O
? O

I O
did O
n't O
mind O
that O
I O
was O
smiling O

like O
, O

you O
ca O
n't O

how O
do O
you O
explain O
it O
? O

I O
'm O
very O
silly O

and O
I O
say O
**ouchies**, O
because O
it O
's O
%ah O
. O

And O
the O
funny O
thing O
is O
it O
was O

, O
you O
know O
, O
standard O
English O
. O

She O
speaks O
standard O
English O
. O

Right O
. O

Standard O
vocabulary O

but O
**ouchies** B-CARDINAL
just O
really O
struck O
her O
as O
something O
very O
odd O
. O

He O

other O
thing O
to O
tell O

Alone O

There O
was O
something O
that O

really O
funny O

something O
really O
funny O
. O

oh O
, O
it O
was O
something O
about O
your O
decision O
. O

oh O
. O
%um O
a O
bad O
, O
not O
a O
hard O
decision O
because O
that O

the O
part O
that O

and O
it O
was O
n't O
you O
that O
had O
the O
problem O

di- O

That O

you O

upset O

That O
was O
long O
mail O
I O
sent O
. O

yeah O
, O
that O
one O
was O
really O
big O
. O

but O
I O
think O
the O
typing O
was O

you O
know O
you O
have O
forty O
- O
four O
pages O
of O
this O
stuff O
? O

Really O
? O

Forty O
- O
three O

I O
have O
some O
information O
about O
this O
call O
. O

That O
's O
cool O
. O

So O
type O
forty B-ORDINAL
- O
three O
pages O
you O
know O
and O
not O
of O
normal O
spacing O
. O

I O
fixed O
it O
all O
so O
it O
short O
like O
the O
email O
kind O
of O
copy O
short O
, O
you O
know O
. O

like O
halfway O
across O
the O
scr- O

forty O
- O
three O

screen O

%um O
weird O
margins O
, O

but O
yeah O

my O
mom O
said O
you O
really O
enjoyed O

She O

yeah O

you O
mentioned O
that O
Je- O

I O
have O
n't O
spoken O
to O
her O
really O

I O
have O
n't O
spoken O
to O
her O
about O
it O

so O
I O
did O
n't O
really O
get O
to O
hear O
about O
it O
. O

But O
I O
'm O
glad O

that O
was O
nice O
. O

yeah O

the O
censored O
version O

and O
then O
I O
saw O
that O
they O
wanted B-ORDINAL
to O
give O
it O
to O
your O
grandparents O

mhm O
yeah O

But O
yeah O

I O
do O
n't O
really O

edit O

%huh O

Did O
she O

%um O
not O
did O

were O
going O
for O
the O
log O
cabin O
because O
you O
know O
they O
have O
maintenance O
on O
the O
outside O
a O
lot O
. O

And O
so O
%um O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
we O
'll O
%uh O
go O
with O
a O
log O
cabin O
house O
. O

%hm O
. O

mhm O
. O

I O
think O
we O
'll O
%uh O

Get O
a O
regular O

or O
a O
thick O
- O
built O
they O
call O
it O
. O
You O
know O
. O

But O
I O
ca O
n't O
do O
that O

oh O
well O

Well O
what O
about O
the O
house O
? O

Is O
that O
lady O
going O
to O
buy O
it O
? O

Well O
the O
lady O
is O
still O
interested O
. O
%um O
But O
not O
ready O
yet O
. O
But O
they O
have O
to O
sell O
their O
home O
first O
. O

oh O
. O

but O
they O
like O
the O
big O
old O
farm O
house O
. O

So O
that O
was O
exciting O
. O

What O
about O
Larry O
and O
Tim O

are O
they O
still O

Well O
the O
thing O
is O
we O
have O
to O
%um O
%uh O
see O
how O
it O
goes O
first O
if O
we O
're O
able O
to O
sell O
it O
. O
You O
know O
. O

And O
if O
not O
then O
we O
'll O
think O
of O
the O
other O

That O
's O
good O
. O

That O
's O
good O
. O

Right O
. O

That O
's O
what O
we O
figure O
. O

But O
what O
was O
the O
hassle O
? O
oh O
nothing O
. O
with O
Larry O

nothing O

oh O
nothing O
. O

uh-uh O
. O

oh O
. O
I O
thought O
they O
gave O
you O
a O
hassle O
. O

No O

oh O
no O
. O

No O
. O

uh-uh O
. O

and O
Larry O

been O
coming O
deer O
hunting O
. O

oh O
really O
. O

he O
has O
a O
blind O
back O
in O
the O
fields O
you O
know O
. O

oh O
jeez O
. O

And O
so O
%um O
he O
comes O
in O

but O
I O
really O
do O
n't O
think O
he O
'll O
get O
one O
because O
he O
said O
shooting O
the O
bow O
and O
arrow O
from O
the O
tree O
is O
kind O
of O
hard O
to O
do O
. O

You O
know O
to O
kill O
a O
deer O
. O

So O

There O
was O
a O
guy O
doing O
it O
back O
there O
when O
I O
was O
out O

He O
was O
up O
in O
the O
tree O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

So O
In O
a O
blind O
. O
That O
's O
what O
they O
have O
to O
do O
. O

%hm O
. O

Anyway O
. O

oh O
Amy O
it O
is O
so O

so O
we O
went O
up O

and O
then O
Ann O
was O
able O
to O
visit O
with O
her O
sister O
. O

And O
then O
we O

So O
we O

Aunt O
Mary O

%uh O
he O
said O

%um O
most O
of O
the O
patients O
that O

that O
are O
in O
a O
wheelchair O
. O

%hm O
So O
%uh O
really O
she O
should O
be O
thankful O
for O
that O
. O

yeah O

So O
what O
else O
to O
tell O
you O

%huh O

I O
ca O

mom O

oh O
you O

. O

How O
many O
times O
do O
I O
have O
to O
explain O
it O
to O
you O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
do O
it O
without O
my O
license O
. O

Great O
. O

What O
should O
we O
talk O
about O
? O

Well O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

Tell O
me O
what O
's O
going O
on O
in O
America B-GPE
. O

I O
have O
n't O
seen O
the O
news O
in O
ages O
. O

Really O
? O

You O
did O
d- O

In O
the O
American B-NORP
news O
I O
mean O

I O
know O
what O
's O
going O
on O
in O
Russia B-GPE

but O

yeah O
. O

Well O
let O
's O
see O
. O

What O
's O
going O
on O
? O
%uh O

You O
want O
me O
to O
just O
give O
you O
some O
headlines O
? O

yeah O
. O

Give O
me O
some O
headlines O
. O

What O
's O
Clinton B-PERSON
up O
to O
? O

up- O

yeah O
. O

I O
was O
just O
going O
to O
say O
Clinton B-PERSON
just O
came O
out O
yesterday O
with O
%uh O
his O
statement O
concerning O
affirmative O
action O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

and O
basically O
he O
has O
in O
the O
past O
said O
that O
he O
was O
not O
in O
favor O
%uh O
you O
know O
of O
making O
%um O
allowances O
strictly O
based O
on O
race O

but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
%uh O
the O
analysis O
in O
the O
news O
shall O
we O
say O
the O
conservative O
analysis O
in O
the O
news O
is O
that O
Clinton O
just O
came O
out O
and O
said O
that O
he O
does O
n't O
believe O
in O
quota O
systems O
and O
in O
reverse O
discrimination O
but O
that O
he O
does O
believe O
that O
affirmative O
action O
is O
necessary O
to O
move O
%uh O
you O
know O
black O
Americans B-NORP
forward O
and O
to O
give O
them O
the O
opportunities O
that O
they O
've O
been O
denied O
. O

So O
he O
's O
kind O
of O
walking O
a O
tight O
rope O
. O

You O
know O
what O
I O
'm O
saying O
? O

Right O
. O

In O
other O
words O
l- O

He O
's O
trying O
to O
please O
everybody O
. O

yeah O
. O

Let O
's O
see O
if O
we O
can O
make O
everybody O
happy O

I O
think O
that O
he O
's O

Then O
he O
just O
ends O
up O
making O
nobody O
happy O
. O

I O
think O
you O
're O
right O
. O

Because O
you O
know O
affirmative O
action O
is O
really O
under O
attack O
in O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
from O
many O
different O
quarters O
right O
now O
. O

and O
it O
's O
a O
big O
issue O
because O
it O
's O
supposed O
to O
be O
a O
race O

%uh O
color O
blind O

we O
're O
supposed O
to O
be O
race O
color O
blind O

and O
yet O
it O
's O
like O
contractors O
that O
are O
bidding O
you O
know O
with O
a O
high O
bid O
or O
higher O
than O
-- O
the O
lowest O
bid O
are O
still O
getting O
the O
contracts O
only O
because O
they O
are O
of O
ethnic O
protected O
you O
know O
black O
or O
whatever O
. O

And O
it O
's O
really O
you O
know O

Right O
. O

And O
then O
so O
they O
're O
taking O
lawsuits O
to O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
and O
all O
of O
this O

so O
it O
's O

Wow O
. O

Another O
thing O
that O
just O
came O
up O
was O
that O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
said O
that O
the O
redistricting O
of O
the O
congressional O
districts O
one O
of O
which O
is O
in O
Georgia B-GPE
violated O
the O
Constitution B-WORK_OF_ART
because O
it O
was O
based O
primarily O
on O
race O
. O

There O
was O
you O
know O
a O
new O

What O
did O
they O
do O
i- O

They O
were O
doing O
it O
because O
like O
they O
were O
trying O
to O
make O
it O
less O
segregated O
? O

They O
were O
trying O
to O
make O
the O
district O
majority O
black O
Americans B-NORP

so O
therefore O
they O
drew O
it O
%uh O
all O
the O
way O
across O
the O
state O
. O

You O
see O
what O
I O
'm O
saying O
? O

oh O
right O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

a O
very O
narrow O
district O

and O
it O
created O
a O
majority O
black O
district O
which O
then O
elected O
a O
black O
representative O

and O
then O
it O
was O
challenged O
because O
it O
said O
well O
the O
only O
reason O
that O
it O
has O
been O
done O
this O
way O
is O
just O
to O
ensure O
that O
it O
was O
majority O
black O

and O
that O
's O
not O

right O

you O
know O

Hello O
? O

I O
'm O
here O
. O

okay O
. O

Anyway O

I O
'm O
mulling O
all O
this O
over O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
mean O
it O

So O
it O
's O
interesting O
because O
we O
're O
doing O
a O
pre-departure O
orientation O

so O
we O
had O
our O
hot O
topics O
discussion O
today O
where O
we O
break O
in O
small O
groups O

and O
we O
talked O
about O
like O
political O
correctness O
and O
racial O
prejudice O
and O
sexual O
harrassment O
, O
feminism O
and O
just O
like O
different O
topics O
that O
they O
might O
encounter O
in O
America O
where O
the O
people O
have O
different O
attitudes O
than O
here O
in O
Russia B-GPE
. O

So O
that O
was O
one O
of O
the O
things O
kind O
of O
like O
that O

But O
I O
'm O
not O
really O
up O
on O
what O
the O
attitude O
is O
in O
America B-GPE
because O
I O
have O
n't O
been O
there O
in O
so O
long O
. O

Well O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
frustration O
I O
think O
over O
the O
fact O
that O
there O
're O
a O
number O
of O
evidences O
that O
the O
affirmative O
action O
program O
is O
in O
fact O
discriminating O
in O
the O
other O
direction O

and O
people O
are O
saying O
wait O
a O
minute O
. O

Why O
do O
n't O
we O
just O
try O
to O
give O
everybody O
an O
equal O
shot O

and O
if O
someone O
feels O
that O
they O
've O
been O
discriminated O
against O
because O
of O
their O
race O
go O
at O
it O
from O
the O
standpoint O
of O
trying O
to O
remedy O
it O
through O
the O
courts O
rather O
than O
saying O
that O
government O
has O
to O
give O
X O
number O
of O
contracts O
to O
minority O
no O
matter O
what O
. O

Right O
. O

And O
as O
a O
result O
some O
people O
are O
getting O
contracts O
just O
because O
of O
the O
color O
of O
their O
skin O

and O
you O
know O
what O
I O
'm O
saying O

it O
's O
still O

When O
they O
might O
not O
even O
be O
the O
most O
qualified O
. O

either O
they O
're O
not O
the O
low O
bid O

you O
know O
normally O
on O
contracts O
you O
take O
the O
low O
bid O
that O
meets O
the O
quality O
specification O
. O

Right O
. O

but O
now O
there O
have O
been O
several O
cases O
where O
clearly O
you O
know O
they O
did O
n't O
get O
it O
because O
they O
just O
were O
n't O
the O
right O
color O
skin O
. O

So O
now O
Right O
. O
is O
that O
really O
remedying O
the O
situation O

or O
is O
it O
's O
creating O
a O
lot O
%uh O
of O
%uh O
resentment O
? O

And O
%uh O
Right O
. O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
too O
bad O
. O

How O
long O

God O
what O
a O
mess O
. O

oh O
it O
's O
a O
mess O
. O

It O
really O
is O
. O

how O
long O
have O
you O
been O
there O
by O
the O
way O
? O

Over O
here O
? O

%um O
it O
'll O
be O
three B-DATE
years I-DATE
in O
November B-DATE
. O

Wow O
. O

So O
you O
really O
are O
out O
of O
touch O
are O
n't O
you O
? O

Well O
I O
like O
to O
think O
I O
'm O
not O
totally O
out O
of O
touch O

Well O
I O
know O
what O
it O
's O
like O
. O

I O
was O
never O
very O
in O
touch O
even O
when O
I O
was O
still O
America B-GPE

so O
. O

oh O
okay O
. O

You O
're O
that O
type O
. O

I O
got O
you O
. O

I O
was O
always O
in O
my O
own O
world O
anyway O

so O
. O

Well O
I O
know O
what O
it O
's O
like O
because O
having O
lived O
over O
in O
Korea B-GPE
for O
almost B-DATE
three I-DATE
years I-DATE
%um O
you O
know O
when O
you O
come O
back O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
you O
know O
the O
society O
has O
changed O
a O
little O
bit O
you O
know O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

New O
terminology O
. O

New O
buzzwords O
. O
And O
all O
that O
stuff O
. O

Right O
. O

Of O
course O
when O
you O
get O
to O
be O
over O
forty O
like O
me O
%um O
, O
you O
can O
miss O
that O
stuff O
just O
being O
an O
American B-NORP
anyway O
. O

It O
all O
passes O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

I O
always O
think O
when O
you O
get O
older O
you O
're O
more O
informed O
. O

When O
I O
was O
in O
college O
I O
did O
n't O
know O
what O
was O
going O
on O
. O

I O
was O
too O
busy O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
'm O
thinking O
of O
%uh O
you O
know O
like O
%uh O
lingo O
that O
the O
young O
people O
come O
up O
with O
you O
know O
. O

Younger O
people O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
think O
I O
'm O
more O
informed O
now O
than O
I O
was O
in O
college O
. O

I O
was O
sort O
of O
out O
of O
it O
in O
college O
. O

But O
%uh O
by O
the O
way O
did O
I O
tell O
you O
that O
I O
have O
a O
new O
job O
? O

Well O
in O
your O
email O
you O
said O
that O
you O
're O
going O
to O
start O
your O
new O
job O
somewhere O
. O

You O
did O
n't O
say O
what O
your O
new O
job O
was O
. O

oh O
okay O
. O

%um O
I O
'm O
resigned O
here O
last B-DATE
week I-DATE
effective O
August B-DATE
tenth I-DATE

and O
I O
'll O
be O
taking O
the O
job O
of O
the O
director O
of O
%um O
the O
English B-LANGUAGE
language O
program O
of O
a O
private O
university O
%uh O
in O
Atlanta B-GPE
a O
larger O
university O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

So O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
a O
step O
up O
for O
me O
. O

it O
's O
called O
Mercer B-ORG
University I-ORG
. O

oh O

well O
you O
'll O
have O
to O
send O
us O
material O
from O
there O

hey O
. O

Now O
we O
're O
talking O
. O

do O
-- O
to O
our O
advisor O
. O
-- O
you O
send O
people O
into O
E O
S O
L O
programs O
? O

Well O
we O
get O
requests O
about O
it O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
many O
people O
actually O
go O
because O
a O
lot O
of O
them O
you O
know O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
money O

but O
we O
get O
students O
every O
year O
that O
ask O
about O
it O
that O
say O
they O
have O
money O
. O

Well O
you O
can O
be O

They O
usually O
do O
n't O
come O
though O
and O
tell O
us O
whether O
or O
not O
they O
go O
. O

yeah O
. O

Well O
you O
can O
be O
sure O
that O
we O
will O
send O
you O
information O
because O
%uh O
you O
know O
I O
've O
got O
to O
go O
down O
there O

and O
we O
're O
trying O
to O
improve O
the O
program O

they O
're O
adding O
thousands O
of O
dollars O
of O
%uh O
state O
of O
the O
art O
language O
%uh O
lab O
equipment O
and O
all O
of O
that O

and O
they O
're O
restructuring O
everything O

so O
that O
's O
what O
I O
'm O
supposed O
to O
do O
next O
. O

Do O
they O
have O
any O
scholarships O
for O
foreign O
students O
? O

I O
've O
never O
heard O
of O
a O
scholarship O
for O
an O
English B-LANGUAGE
language O
program O
personally O

but O
I O
think O

We O
never O
did O
either O

but O
I O
keep O
thinking O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
find O
one O
of O
these O
days O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
know O
. O

I O
'm O
sure O
that O
they O
pro- O

You O
know O
I O
e- O

the O
question O
of O
whether O
they O
have O
scholarships O
for O
international O
students O
%um O
for O
the O
regular O
program O
is O
a O
good O
one O

and O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
find O
out O
. O

I O
'd O
like O
to O
think O
that O
they O
do O

and O
I O
think O
uh-huh O
. O
they O
might O

but O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
yet O
. O

Right O
. O

it O
's O
not O
going O
to O
be O
my O
particular O
area O
of O
expertise O
you O
know O
i- O

Right O
. O

that O
's O
going O
to O
be O
regular O
program O

but O
still O
I O
would O
like O
to O
know O
so O
I O
can O
tell O
people O
like O
you O
. O

So O
were O
you O
looking O
for O
a O
new O
job O

or O
did O
they O
just O
like O
come O
to O
you O
? O

Well O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
new O
job O

and O
I O
've O
been O
looking O
for O
about O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O

%uh O
. O

and O
%uh O
when O
I O
went O
to O
NASA B-ORG
in O
New B-GPE
Orleans I-GPE
you O
know O
the O
one O
that O
you O
missed O

I O
know O
the O
one O
, O
the O
great O
one O
that O
was O
so O
much O
fun O
. O

oh O
it O
was O
a O
blast O

but O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
it O
was O
more O
fun O
than O
Miami B-GPE
I O
mean O
you O
know O
. O

But O
it O
was O
fun O
though O
. O

You O
would O
have O
enjoyed O
it O

and O
as O
I O
said O
to O
you O
in O
the O
email O
%uh O
the O
Russians B-NORP
and O
the O
Siberians B-NORP
and O
all O
of O
these O
people O
were O
just O
hilarious O
. O

I O
mean O
we O
had O
a O
nice O
little O
visit O
. O

We O
really O
did O
. O

%uh O
it O
's O
too O
bad O
I O
did O
n't O

oh O
I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
they O
were O
calling O
her O
Lovie O
. O

We O
were O
in O
stitches O
to O
hear O
that O
she O
was O
calling O
herself O
Lovie O
. O

oh O
really O
? O

You O
did O
n't O
know O
that O
? O

Well O
because O
you O
would O
n't O
say O
that O
. O

Because O
in O
Russian B-NORP
it O
's O
just O
you O
know O
Lyubov B-PERSON

but O
it O
's O
just O
a O
Russian B-NORP
name O
. O

I O
mean O
you O
would O
n't O
think O
of O
translating O
it O
into O
English B-LANGUAGE

but O
the O
thought O
of O
people O
calling O
her O
Lovie O
in O
America B-GPE
is O
so O
funny O
. O

Well O
that O
's O
what O
she O
said O
. O

I O
mean O
I O
did O
n't O
know O
any O

Well O
then O
I O
mean O
like O
it O
's O
just O
so O
her O
to O
do O
that O
that O
I O
just O
think O
it O
's O
hysterical O
. O

Is O
it O
? O

yeah O
. O

You O
should O
have O
seen O
them O
dancing O
around O
with O
the O
crowd O
out O
there O
when O
they O
had O
this O
%uh O
%uh O
Carribean B-NORP
band O
or O
something O
%uh O
running O
through O
the O
streets O
of O
New B-GPE
Orleans I-GPE
. O

It O
was O
kind O
of O
interesting O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

But O
%um O

yeah O
. O

And O
we O
went O
on O
a O
shrimp O
boat O
tour O
also O
. O

It O
was O
kind O
of O
fun O
. O

%um O
you O
know O
you O
got O
to O
sort O
of O
do O
that O
kind O
of O
weird O
stuff O
. O

%um O
I O
interviewed O
for O
this O
job O
at O
NASA B-ORG
. O

So O
that O
's O
kind O
of O
how O
it O
got O
to O
where O
it O
was O
%uh O
you O
know O

that O
was O
a O
major O
point O
to O
reach O
is O
do O
that O
interview O

and O
that O
was O
a O
good O
interview O

so O

Right O
. O

yeah O

%uh O
I O
knew O
they O
were O
trying O
to O
expand O
their O
program O

and O
I O
said O
well O
if O
you O
're O
going O
to O
do O
that O
call O
me O
because O
I O
would O
be O
interested O
in O
an O
opportunity O

and O
so O
I O
've O
taken O
it O
you O
know O
. O

Well O
that O
's O
great O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
'm O
excited O
about O
it O
. O

It O
's O
g- O

Well O
what O
city O
were O
you O
in O
? O

Were O
you O
far O
from O
Atlanta B-GPE
? O

No O
. O

Actually O
%uh O
Branow O
is O
located O
north O
of O
Atlanta B-GPE
about B-QUANTITY
fifty I-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
north O
%uh O
up O
the O
freeway O
which O
around O
here O
is O
you O
know O
not O
even O
considered O
to O
be O
that O
far O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

but O
this O

And O
I O
do O
n't O
even O
live O
in O
Gainesville B-GPE
which O
is O
the O
city O
where O
Branow O
is O

I O
commute O
about B-QUANTITY
thirty I-QUANTITY
three I-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
from O
the O
southwest O
. O

It O
's O
a O
forty B-TIME
five I-TIME
minute I-TIME
ride O
. O

And O
I O
'll O
be O
commuting O

so O
you O
'll O
be O
closer O
now O
. O
[E_S O

Well O
actually O
I O
may O
be O
two B-CARDINAL
or O
three B-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
closer O
. O

I O
'm O
going O
to O
be O
commuting O
down O
into O
Atlanta B-GPE
. O

see O
I O
live O
north O
of O
Atlanta B-GPE
. O

And O
%um O
the O
Jesuit O
who O
explained O
that O
to O
me O
said O
this B-DATE
is O
nothing O
against O
other O
programs O
that O
are O
very O
very O
wonderful O
you O
know O
where O
they B-DATE
give I-DATE
service I-DATE
for O
service O
's O
sake O
-- O

mhm O
. O

-- O
but O
it O
's O
just O
that O
this O
thing O
is O
because O
of O
a O
conversion O
or O
because O
of O
their B-DATE
friendship B-DATE
with O
Christ O
-- O
mhm O
. O
-- O
in O
wanting O
to O
collaborate O
with O
that B-DATE
project O
, O
you O
know O

mhm O
. O

-- O
and O
the O
second O
one O
is O
that O
you O
live O
in O
the O
same O
poor O
area O
where O
you O
're O
going O
to O
work O
. O

mhm O
. O

Now O
let O
me O
say O
that O
I O
have O
seen O
you O
know O
that O
this O
very B-CARDINAL

I O
took O
it O
literally O

and O
you O
know B-PERSON
I I-PERSON
said I-PERSON
to O
Jackie O
this O
is O
very O
important O

and O
we O
did O
n't O
take O
some O
people O
because O
of O
that O

mhm O
. O

You O
know O
in O
fact O
one O
Jewish O
gal O
that O
she O
was O
just O
crazy O
about O
and O
was O
very O
very O
dynamic O
and O
knew O
Spanish O
and O
everything O

but O
I O
said O
Jackie O
how O
will O
we O
say O
she O
's O
doing O
this O
out O
of O
a O
commitment O
to O
Christ O

mhm O
. O

You O
know O
I O
mean O
I O
ca O
n't O
say O
I O
'll O
agree O
and O
this O
is O
my O
commit- O

but O
I O
have O
also O
found O
that O
as O
in O
all O
things O
human O
it O
is O
not O
perfectly O
kept O
down O
here O
. O

mhm O
. O

%uh O
I O
mean O
I O
've O
met O
other O
volunteers O
who O
are O
you O
know O
from O
Spain O
and O
everything O

mhm O

%uh O
but O
anyway O
I O
would O
like O
to O
still O
keep O
that O
and O
not O
change O
that O
with O
Jackie O
-- O

mhm O
. O

-- O
and O
I O
think O
-- O
mhm O
. O
-- O
it O
would O
be O
important O
that O
people O
knew O
that O
. O

oh O
this O
is O
great O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
mean O
it O
is O
great O
for O
me O

I O
'm O
using O
your O
phone O
call O
here O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

Well O
I O
am O
delighted O
. O

oh O
great O
. O

Well O
just O
tell O
me O
a O
little O
bit O
about O
your B-FAC
apostolate I-FAC
because O
you O
said O
to O
me O
in O
your O
letter O
now O
pray O
for O
my O
apostolate O
too O

do O
you O
mean O
with O
the O
girls O
? O

Well O
basically O
in O
the O
college O

yeah O

%um O
but O
%uh O
there O
are O
a B-TIME
couple I-TIME
things O
that O
I O
wanted O
to O
be O
sure O
to O
mention O
to O
you O

yeah O
. O

One O
is O
that O
%um O
Isabelle O
was O
one O
of O
four O
women O
who O
made O
the B-TIME
centering O
prayer O
retreat O
. O

okay O
I O
read O
that B-TIME
sure I-TIME
in I-TIME
your O
letter O

okay O

And O
another O
one O
was O
named O
Guadalupe O
otherwise B-TIME
known O
as O
Lupita O
. O

okay O
. O

And O
apparently B-DATE
sometimes O
she O
teaches B-MONEY
about I-MONEY
third I-MONEY
grade O
maybe O

yeah O

And O
sometimes O
she O
brings O
the O
children O
to O
this B-MONEY
fe I-MONEY
alegria I-MONEY
where B-CARDINAL
you B-CARDINAL
are O

oh O
okay O

So O
you O
may O
meet O
her O

oh O
okay O

Now O

Guadalupe O

and O
she O
's O
called O
Lupita O

Lupita O

yeah O
okay O
. O

Now O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the B-TIME
retreat O
we O
had O
a O
little O
sharing B-PERSON
session O

Yes O

And O
she O
began O
to O
speak O

and O
she O
became O
a O
little O
bit O
emotional O

yeah O

And O
she O
said O
she O
really O
wished O
she O
could O
talk O
more O
about O
her B-PERSON
experience O

but O
she O
could O
n't O
because O
she O
was O
more O
comfortable O
in O
Spanish O
. O

yeah O
okay O

And O
so O
when O
I O
said O
goodbye O
to O
her O
and O
everything O
she O
spoke O
as O
if O
she O
would O
be O
meeting O
you B-DATE
at I-DATE
some O
time O

yeah O
okay O

And O
I O
told O
her O
%um O
I O
was O
n't O
setting O
you B-CARDINAL
up O
to O
be O
a O
spiritual O
director O
or O
anything O

but O
I O
did O
say O
to O
her O
that O
if O
she O
felt O
that O
she O
wanted O
to O
talk O
about B-CARDINAL
her I-CARDINAL
prayer O
experience O
in O
Spanish O
that O
you O
would O
probably O
be O
able O
certainly O
to O
understand O
her O
but O
to O
empathize O
a O
little O
bit O
with O
what O
she O
was O
experiencing O

oh O
sure O

yeah O

yeah O

So O
I O
wanted O
to O
tell O
you O
that O
I O
said O
that O
%um O

okay O

now O
did O
you O
give O
me O
her O
number O
in O
that O
letter B-CARDINAL
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
so O
. O

No O
okay O

but O
Isabelle O
would O
know O
it O
because O
-- O
Yes O
. O
-- O
they O
went O
together O
. O

yeah O
okay O

and O
she O
seems O
t- O

%eh O
%uh O
I O
think O
maybe O
when O
the O
school O
year O
starts O
or O
something O
-- O
yeah O
-- O
Lupita O
will O
be O
up O
there O
with O
her O
students O
doing O
a O
service O
project O

or O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
just O
what O
it O
is O
-- O
okay O
-- O
that O
they O
do O
. O

yeah O
. O

okay O

But O

there O
are O
many O
fe O
alegria O
centers O
-- O

uh-huh O
. O

-- O
so O
it O
's O
possible O
that O
she O
works O
in O
one O
and O
not O
the O
one O
I O
am O
in O

oh O
. O

but O
the O
thing O
is O
with O
Isabelle O
I O
can O
get O
in O
touch B-DATE
with I-DATE
her O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

yeah O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

So O
that O
's O
fine O
. O

mhm O
. O

yeah O
. O

Then O
the O
other O
thing O
I O
wanted O
to O
mention O
to O
you O
is O
%um O
with O
respect O
to O
my O
niece O
and O
my O
nephew O

yeah O
. O

My O
nephew O
's O
name O
is O
Jeff O
McDougal O

yeah O
. O

He O
made O
his O
vows O
in O
the O
Jesuits O
a O
year O
ago O
. O

You O
said O
that O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
remember O
if O
I O
did O
or O
not O
. O

Yes O
. O

And O
so O
he O
spent B-DATE
%uh I-DATE
a O
portion O
of O
the O
summer O
in O
Mexico O
yeah O
And O
then O
went O
to O
El O
Salvador O
after O
he O
finished O
his O
summer O
school O
courses O
. O

okay O
. O

Now O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
he O
will O
come O
back O
again O
. O

I O
have O
a O
feeling O
he O
will O
probably O
spend O
a O
good O
portion O
of O
his O
life O
somewhere O
%mm O
in O
one O
of B-MONEY
the I-MONEY
Central I-MONEY
-- O
yeah O
-- O
American O
or O
South O
American O
countries O
-- O

yeah O
. O

-- O
but O
if O
you O
should O
meet O
him O
, O
I O
know O
you O
'll O
keep O
an O
eye O
on O
him O
or O
-- O
oh O
yes O
-- O
something O
. O

yeah O
. O

Jeff O
McDougal B-DATE

uh-huh O
. O

that O
's O
neat B-ORG
. O

uh-huh O
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
then O
my O
niece O
Anne O
%um O
maybe O
you O
wo O
n't O
meet O
her O
because O
even O
though O
she O
's O
raised O
Catholic O
and O
all O
that O
yeah O
Right O
now O
she O
does O
n't O
want O
to O
associate O
herself O
with O
any O
kind O
of O
a O
religious O
service O
project O
although O
she O
's O
very O
interested O
in O
something O
like O
what O
you O
're B-PERSON
doing I-PERSON

yeah O
yeah O
. O

%um O
so O
we O
'll O
see O
what O
happens O
on O
that O
. O

Where O
is O
she O
living O
? O

right O
now O
she O
's O
in O
Portland O
. O

okay O
okay O

yeah O

%uh O
and O
she O
's O
college O
age O

and O
-- O
yeah O
. O
-- O
%uh O
she O
's O
been O
working O

but O
she O
's O
going O
to O
go O
to O
school O

but O
she O
's O
going O
to O
%um O
%uh O
take O
courses O
in O
Spanish O

and O
she O
's O
kind O
of O
going O
through O
%um O
conversion O
, O
life O
changing O
experience O

-- O
yeah O
yeah O
-- O
and O
when O
she O
's O
all O
done O

I O
mean O
I O
know O
she O
's O
moving O
toward O
a O
simpler O
lifestyle O
and O
a O
life O
of O
service O

and O
yeah O
-- O
how O
much O
God O
is O
going O
to O
be O
in O
the O
picture O
and O
not O
it O
-- O
oh O
-- O
remains O
to O
be O
seen O
. O

yeah O
. O

But O
I O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
hope O
for O
her O
. O

oh O
yes O
. O

yeah O
yeah O
. O

So O
I O
just O
was O
so O
happy O
when O
I O
%um O
you O
know O
discovered O
that O
these O
ladies O
were O
from O
the O
same O
area O
where O
you O
are O
and O
-- O
yeah O
-- O
called O
Peace O
and O
got O
the O
address O

and O
when O
they O
saw O
your O
address O
they O
said O
oh O
they O
wanted O

meet O
you O
and O
give O
you O
chance O
to O
meet O

. O
in O
here O

it O
's O
just O
very O
disorganized O

disorganized O

that O
's O
why O
the O
lights O
are O
constantly O
going O
out O

and O
the O
transportation O
is O
just O

%eh O
but O
anyway O
Jon O
Ward O

everything O
when O
he O
finishes O
-- O
%mm O
. O
his O
stint O
in O
Camden O

but O

Well O
that O
's O
why O
Isabel O
wanted O
to O
bring O
the O
letter O
to O
you O
because O
she O
said O
you O
would O
be O
a O
long O
time O
before O
you O
'd O
get O
it O
otherwise O
. O

yeah O
yeah O

%um O
and O
well O
anyway O
I O
wrote O

a O
little O
note O

you O
'll O
be O
getting O
it O
%um O
-- O
oh O
oh O
nice O
-- O
through O
Don O

-- O
oh O
-- O
%uh O
you O
know O

he O
brought O
them O
all O
with O
him O
today O
and O
everything O

so O
%um O
, O

but O
anyway O
%um O
how O
are O
things O
going O
at O
the O
college O
with O
Peg O
? O

Well O
, O
you O
know O
she O
's O
worked O
very O
hard O
all O
summer O

and O
she O
's O
really O
-- O
1622.82_1623.11_B: O
yeah O
. O
-- O
taking O
every O
area O
and O
working O
from O
the O
ground O
up O
-- O
yeah B-PERSON
-- O
and O
really O
rebuilding O
and O

And O
she O
's O
only O
an O
interim O
is O
n't O
she O
? O

Well O
yes O

but O
I O
mean O
we O
're O
just O
focusing O
on O
what O
has O
to O
be O
done O
right O
now O
-- O
yeah O
the O
present O
-- O
and O
the O
long O
range O
planning O
that O
we O
have O
to O
do O
in O
order O
to O
make O
what O
happens O
now O
happen O

Is O
she O
doing O
a O
good O
job O
? O

oh O
marvelous O

oh O
I O
'm O
so O
glad O

And O
I O
mean O
there O
's O
so O
much O
respect O
for O
her O

I O
have O
not O
heard O
one O
negative O
comment O
anywhere O
. O

yeah O

oh O
good O

oh O
then O
I O
'm O
so O
glad O
. O

So O
I O
think O
that O
if O
we O
're O
going O
to O
make O
it O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
now O

yeah O

And O
if O
we O
're O
not O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
now O

but O
everybody O
's O
just O
giving O
everything O
to O
make O
it O
work O
out O

yeah O
yeah O

So O
we O
're O
hoping O
for O
the O
best O

yeah O

and O
how O
's O
the B-PERSON
enrollment B-GPE
, O
Roseanne O
? O

Well O
it O
's O
not O
good O

yeah O

We O
have O
sixty O
freshman O
coming O

yeah O

and O
is O
that O
not O
good O
? O

that O
's O
correct O

last O
year O
we O
had O
eighty O

and O
we O
were O
very O
distressed O
at O
how O
small O
the O
number O
was O
-- O

oh O
my O
goodness O

oh O
yeah O

-- O
and O
this O
year O
we O
have O
sixty O
. O

yeah O

So O
%uh O
anyway O
we O
're O
really O
doing O
our O
utmost O
to O
do O
some O
creative O
planning O
to O
reverse O
that O
trend O
for O
next O
year O

1685.48_1686.56_B: O
yeah O
yeah O

So O
, O

Well O
Aunt O
Joyce O
it O
's O
been O
really O
nice O
to O
talk O
to O
you O

we O
've O
gone O
over O
our O
half O
hour O

so O

oh O

oh O
okay O

because O
on O
the O
last O
phone O
call O
they O
came O
in O
and O
told O
us O

yeah O
that O
's O
what O
I O
understood O
was O
going O
to O
happen O

so O

yeah O

well O
anyway O
maybe O
they O
're O
anyone O
happened O

but O
anyway O
you O
're O
just O
a O
dear O
to O
have O
taken O
your O
time O
to O
call O
me O
because B-NORP
it O
's O
a O
big O
thrill B-ORG
for I-ORG
me I-ORG
-- O
oh O
. O
-- O
to O
talk B-ORG
to O
our O
sisters O

it O
-- O
uh-huh O
. O
-- O
really O
is O

so O
%um O
I O
think O
you O
know O
we O
'll O
be O
in O
touch O

and O
you O
're O
kind O
of O
as O
you O
said O
my O
liaison O
now O
with O
%uh O
Don O
Ward O

Well O
I O
'll O
be O
that O

and O

can O
be O
mine O
with O
the O
four O
ladies O
Isabel O
and O
Lupita B-PERSON

and O
there O
were B-PERSON
two O

them O
together O

but O
you O
know O

been O
hooked O
up O
with O
%um O
yeah O
different O
programs O

but O
%uh O
%um O
I O
'm O
trying O
to O
think O
what O
else O
is O
going O
on O
%um O
what O
else O
is O
news O

Chris O
and O
Michelle O

mom O
and O
dad O
%um O

What O
's O
Nathan O
doing O
? O

Did O
you O
hear O
about O
that O
? O

No O

%uh O
let O
's O
see O

how O
do O
I O
put O
this O

%um O
%um O
%uh O
he O
actually O
was O
caught O
stealing O

oh O
really O

yeah O

and O
there O
could O
be O
certain O
charges O
pressed O

but O
%um O
%um O
that O
's O
going O
to O
be O
worked O
out O

I O
mean O
that O
happened O
like O
four O
weeks O
ago O

%uh O

So O
it O
's O
pretty O
much O
just O
settled O

but O
he O
was O
%uh O
at O
the O
lumber O
yard O

yeah O

they O
had O
%um O
they O
had O
%uh O
a O
detective O
%um O
%ah O
yeah O
who O
was O

and O
he O
was O
caught O
selling O
you O
know O
to O
a O
person O
lumber O

So O
yeah O

that O
's O

I O
had O
forgotten O
all O
about O
that O
%um O

Well O
you O
mentioned O
that O

I O
was O
under O
the O
impression O
that O
you O
'd O
already O
know O
ab- O

yeah O

I O
know O

that O
's O
okay O

did O
he O
always O
worked O
this O
way O

yeah O

Do O
n't O
worry O

I O
'm O
not O
worried O

yeah O

%uh O
it O
was O
one O
of O
those O

yeah O

in O
fact O
I O
was O
the O
last O
one O
to O
find O
out O

Well O
next O
to O
last O

wait O

yeah O

right O
right O

it O

just O
one O
of O
those O
things O

yeah O

%um O
So O
that O
has O
to O
go O
via O
the O
court O

so O

yeah O

well O
like O
each O
kid O
has O
to O
go O
through O
theirs O
I O
guess O
%huh O

yeah O

there O
's O
always O
something O
new O

yeah O

So O
yeah O

that O
was O
interesting O

but O
%um O

%mm O
%mm O

So O
yeah O

that O
's O
really O

I O
mean O
that O
yeah O
I O
guess O
would O
be O
kind O
of O
like O
the O
major O
news O
then O
%uh O

yeah O

%uh O

I O

this O
is O
for O
both O
of O
us O

it O
's O
our O
last O
year O
of O
residence O

yeah O

And O
then O
once O
we- O

you O
know O
we O
'll O
have O
to O
write O
our O
dissertation O

but O
%um O
We O
wo O
n't O
have O
to O
be O
going O
to O
school O
and O
stuff O
like O
this O

but O

oh O
that O
'll O
be O
nice O

that O
's O
thirty O
years O
of O
school O
%huh O

So O

oh O
yeah O

really O

so O
that O
aspect O
will O
be O
done O

and O
then O
%um O

so O
yeah O

mhm O

So O
I O
'm O
trying O
to O
think O
what O
else O
is O
going O
o- O

are O
you O
following O
the O
pope O
's O
visit O
in O
the O
United O
States O
? O

yeah O

yeah O

yeah O

he O
was O
a O

it O
turned O
out O
very O
good O

That O
's O
good O

I O
heard O
some O
lady O
died O
while O
he O
was O
saying O
mass O
or O
something O

oh O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
I O
'm O
sure O
statistically O
there O
's O
a O
good O
chance O
of O
someone O
dying O

yeah O

yeah O

%um O
the O
sense O
was O
good O
because O
%um O

oh O

a O
lot O

oh O
yeah O

and O
he O
has O
to O
yield O
his O
presence O

uh-huh O
. O

You O
know O
how O
he O
has O
his O
presence O
and O
people O
are O
attracted O
to O
his O
presence O
and O
yeah O
yeah O
feel O
that O
that O
whole O
phenomena O
's O
still O

yeah O

%um O

Because O
the O
Italians O
made O
it O
sound O
that O
he O
was O
n't O
getting O
much O
attention O

And O
the O
reporters O
were O
n't O
ready O

and O
he O
was O
n't O
getting O
%uh O
good O
coverage O
in O
the O
United O
States O

Well O
I O
know O
before O
h- O

well O
that O
may O
be O
true O
%uh O

I O
mean O
to O
some O
extent O
I O
have O
n't O

like O
it O
's O
like O
I O
have O
a O

yeah O

I O
do O
n't O
watch O
T O
V O

so O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
's O
on O
T O
V O

but O
%um O
%um O
the O
news- O

uh-huh O

Well O
see O
before O
they O
had O
various O
theologians O
who O
are O
critics O
of O
them O
yeah O
who O
were O
%um O
you O
know O
saying O
that O
you O
know O
he O
's O
not O
in O
touch O
and O
all O
this O
stuff O

yeah O

there O
was O
that O
aspect O

but O
once O
he O
was O
here O
the O
amazing O
thing O
you O
know O

because O
it O
does O
n't O
make O
any O
difference O
what O
the O
press O
says O
uh-huh O
because O
once O
yeah O
he O
has O
those O
huge O
crowds O
yeah O
yeah O
and O
you O
know O
there O
's O
still O
like O

mind O
boggled O
that O
you O
know O
he O
gets O
these O
huge O
crowds O

yeah O

yeah O

And O
his O
%um O
ability O
to O
have O
like O
instant O
conversions O

I O
mean O
I O
've O
known O
tons O
of O
people O

and O
they O
're O
just O
there O
to O
have O
instant O
conversion O

yeah O

that O
's O
good O

So O
I O
mean O
it O
doe- O

I O
mean O
granted O
he O

the O
process O
does O
n't O
necessarily O
help O

Right O

but O
there O
's O
something O
about O
him O
where O
he O
does O
n't O
need O
the O
press O

yeah O

yeah O

I O
mean O
it O

yeah O

I O
mean O
because O
he O
's O
able O
to O
get O
the O
%um O

you O
know O
so O
that O

yeah O

I O
mean O
in O
in O
j- O

oh O
I O
guess O
you O
just O
become O
so O
it O
's O
so O
much O
part O
of O
What O
you O
expect O

there O
will O
be O
this O
qu- O

like O
they O
'll O
bring O
up O
all O
these O
like O
like O
statistics O
how O
people O
even O
while O
they O
like O
the O
pope O
they O
disagree O
with O
what O
he O
says O

uh-huh O

I O
mean O
they O
always O
do O

so O
you O
kind O
of O
oh O
yeah O
that O
's O
normal O
just O
become O
accustomed O
to O
it O

Right O

But O

%uh O
I O
know O

but O
just O
it O
's O
amazing O
%um O
you O
know O
you O
know O
people O
who O
have O
an O
incredible O
affect O

I O
mean O
I O
do O
n't O
know O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
it O
is O

but O
%um O

So O
yeah O

yeah O
that O
I O
've O
been O
following O
pretty O
closely O
you O
know O
through O
the O
papers O
and O
stuff O

but O
%um O
yeah O

so O
he O
's O
leaving O
about O
right O
now O

he O
'll O
be O
leaving O
pretty O
soon O

yeah O

because O
he O
's O
only O
staying O
five O
days O

yeah O

he O
leaves O
tonight O

%uh O

So O

yeah O

so O
did O

how O
was O
Julius O
stay O
back O
at O

I O
really O
have O
n't O
even O
seen O
her O
since O
she O
got O
back O

I O
only O

one O
of O
the O
sisters O
came O
down O
to O
Sicily O

so O
they O
sent O
me O
the O
letter O
. O

yeah O

%uh O
I O
was O
just O
wondering O
how O
her O
family O
was O
doing O

yeah O

I O
have O
no O
idea O

so O
I O
have O
to O
go O
to O
Italy O
to O
find O
out O

right O

yeah O

because O
I O
have O
n't O
like O
%um O

in O
fact O
Mark O
is O
trying O
to O
get O
hold O
of O
John O
yeah O
yeah O
because O
yeah O
I O
had O
written O
because O
he O
wants O
to O
see O
about O
me O

Mark O
was O
thinking O
about O
going O
to O
some O
type O
of O
vocational O
school O

%um O
And O
John O
is O
in O
the O
school O
%uh O
in O
Saginaw O
or O
Lancing O
areas O

and O

yeah O

yeah O

Saginaw O
I O
think O

but O
I O
do O
n't O
know O

yeah O

So O
I O
'm O
trying O
to O
think O
of O
%um O
what O
else O
is O
happening O
in O
the O
big O
world O
here O

Yes O

it O
's O
just O
basic O
ever- O

we O
're O
back O
to O
the O
grinding O
stone O
of O
papers O
and O
%uh O
stuff O
like O
that O

so O

yeah O

yeah O

I O
with O
one O
of O
the O
people O
I O
teach O
with O
%um O

%uh O
like O
he O
's O
principally O
responsible O
for O
all O
the O
English O
translations O
for O
John O
Paul O
's O
work O

%uh O
I O
see O

%uh O
that O
's O
nice O

yeah O

%um O
so O
it O
was O

%uh O
it O
's O
funny O
to O
hear O
they O
're O
there O

but O
%um O
I O
'm O
trying O
to O
think O
what O
else O
is O

I O
just O
spur O
of O
the O
moment O
called O

I O
had O
no O
i- O

I O
was O
like O
well O
there O
's O
something O

what O
time O
is O
it O
right O
now O
in O
Italy O
? O

okay O

%um O
it O
's O
twenty O
to O
nine O

okay O

We O
already O
changed O
our O
time O

did O
you O
guys O
? O

I O
hope O
I O
did O
n't O

we O
sent O
it O
back O

I O
know O
that O
's O
coming O
up O
pretty O
soon O

I O
do O
n't O

%uh O
yeah O

we O
do O
it O
before O
you O
guys O
do O

okay O

so O
it O
's O
nine O
thirty O

No O

it O
's O
twenty O
to O
nine O
eight O
thirty O

it O
's O
eight O
thirty O

oh O
good O

oh O
you O
're O
only O
like O
five O
hours O
behind O
right O
now O
or O
ahead O
if O
I O

four O
or O
five O
behind O

yeah O

yeah O

yeah O

right O

right O

gosh O
so O
what O
's O

you O
know O
I O
want O
to O
ask O
%um O
how O
is O
this O
with O
%uh O

Is O
there O
anything O
? O

Is O
that O
just O
more O
or O
less O
what O
it O
is O
? O

it O
's O
pretty O
much O
anything O
that O
's O
going O
to O
happen O
or O
not O
going O
to O
happen O
is O
pretty O
much O
done O
right O
? O

%ah O
I O
think O
so O

yeah O

yeah O

How O
's O
the O
mail O
order O

I O
think O
they O
're O
doing O
pretty O
good O
because O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
too O
much O
contact O
with O
them O

Right O

right O

And O
so O
I O
really O
have O
no O
idea O
to O
tell O
you O
the O
truth O

yeah O

%um O
see O
yeah O
because O
I O
know O
that O
this O
Summer O
they O
did O
a O
vocational O
camp O

but O
I O
have O
no O
idea O
how O
it O
went O
Right O
Because O
I O
'm O
being O
down O
in O
Sicily O

you O
know O
we O
're O
down O

yeah O

oh O
yeah O

I O
know O
you O
're O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
%mm O
%mm O

yeah O

I O
'm O
surprised O
you O
guys O
have O
a O
house O
there O

wow O

yeah O

we O
have O
two O
houses O
in O
Sicily O

oh O
really O

yeah O

we O
're O
twenty O
minutes O
apart O

right O

right O

and O
%eh O
next O
year O
we O
should O
be O
going O
to O
Fatima O

oh O
wow O

that O
'll O
be O
a O
big O
break O
for O
you O
guys O
then O

yeah O

yeah O

the O
first O
of O
October O

some O
of O
the O
sisters O
made O
like O

how O
many O
of O
them O

there O
was O
this O

eight O
sisters O
that O
made O
their O
final O
vows O

okay O

And O
on O
the O
twenty O
- O
ninth O
of O
October O
fourteen O
sisters O
make O
their O
first O
vows O

How O
many O
? O

fourteen O

good O

and O
they O
're O
the O
ones O
that O
went O

Diana O
was O
with O
them O

Well O
that O
would O
've O
been O
the O
group O
of O
Di O

okay O

She O
knows O
them O

yeah O

okay O

and O
then O
we O
'll O
have O
three O
that O
enter O
novitiate O

okay O

good O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
many O
well O
%eh O
come O
and O
do O
the O

%eh O
I O
do O
n't O
know O

yeah O

well O
I O
was O
telling O
s- O

I O
seldom O

you O
g- O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
you O
guys O
do O
things O

but O
%um O
like O
if O
there O
's O
any O
of O
the O
sisters O
in O
Rome O
like O

the O
midwest O

they O
should O
go O
to O
Stevenville O

uh-huh O

yeah O

I O
think O
that O
would O
be O
great O
because O
I O
you O
know O
like O
the O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
you O
the O
Dominican O
sisters O
in O
Nashville O

uh-huh O

I O
was O
very O
influential O
helping O
them O
get O
sisters O
in O
the O
Tuperville O
and O
also O
%um O
The O
Daughters O
of O
Saint O
Paul O

yeah O

The O
Daughters O
of O
Saint O
Paul O
are O
good O
sisters O

yeah O

America O

a O
very O
close O
%ah O
you O
know O
relat- O

I O
've O
helped O
him O
out O
in O
so O
many O
different O
ways O
yeah O
getting O
their O
religious O
ed O
programs O
started O

but O
%uh O

parishes O

and O
then O
help O
them O
with O
their O
vocations O

and O

%uh O
%uh O
one O
of O
our O
sisters O
has O
a O
sister O
in O
that O
order O

right O

yeah O

they O
kind O
of O
been O
around O

they O
have O
been O
at O
the O
trench O

I O
mean O

yeah O

because O
they O
always O

of O
course O
the O
ones O
that O
I O
really O
know O
are O
from O
Cleveland O

and O
%uh O
uh-huh O
%uh O
they O
said O
that O
you O
know O
of O
course O
they O
still O
have O
some O
troubles O
like O
with O
the O
%um O
Italian O
sisters O

but O
%um O
uh-huh O
yeah O
yeah O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
they O
meant O

I O
mean O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
exactly O
they O
meant O
by O
that O

but O
I O
mean O
in O
general O
I O
mean O
they O
have O
like O
a O
moderate O
increase O
in O
vocation O
uh-huh O
something O
like O
that O

but O
%um O

yeah O

that O
's O

I O
'll O

but O
if O
you O
ever O
get O
a O
chance O

we O
have O
a O
sister O
that O
lives O
in O
Illinois O

What O
do O
you O
mean O

she O
lives O
there O
? O

I O
mean O
%um O
her O
family O
is O
from O
Illinois O

And O
they O
still O
have O
just O
one B-CARDINAL
daughter O
? O

Yes O

and O
I O
think O
that O
's O
probably O
all O
because O
%um O
I O
think O
Carl B-PERSON
feels O
like O
people O
like O
me O
overpopulate O
the O
world O
. O

I O
have O
three B-CARDINAL
sons O

and O
I O
thought O
no O
he O
's O
so O
forgetful O

he O
'll O
never O
remember O
. O

It O
's O
not O
worth O
it O

Well O
he O
never O
would O

or O
you O
know O
he O
would O
n't O
know O
how O
to O
get O
it O
. O

I O
used O
to O
call O
him O
. O

Well O
, O
just O
Winston B-PERSON

I O
know O

you O
know O
? O

I O
used O
to O
call O
him O
every O
once O
in O
a O
while O

but O
their O
niece O
like O
I O
think O
she O
's O
the O
oldest O
Really O
? O
uh-huh O
of O
all O
the O
kids O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
you O
know O
much O
about O
the O
family O
but O
the O
one O
whose O
father O
got O
killed O
in O
Nicaragua B-GPE
fighting O

but O
anyway O
%um O
No O
. O
she O
was O
living O
in O
the O
house O

and O
she O
's O
kind O
of O

I O
do O
n't O
know O

all O
I O
know O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
she O
would O
've O
been O
this O
way O
if O
she O
had O
n't O
had O
all O
the O
problems O
she O
had O
in O
her O
life O

but O
she O
's O
kind O
of O
a O
goofball O

and O
she O
ran O
up O
such O
big O
bills O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
they O
've O
had O
a O
phone O
for O
a O
whole O
year O
because O
he O
ca O
n't O
pay O
them O
off O

and O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
she O
's O
still O
living O
there O
or O
not O
. O

But O
I O
can O
give O
you O
my O
address O

yeah O

Wow O

%huh O

yeah O

I O
'd O
%uh O

yeah O

I O
'm O
so O
gla- O

you O
know O
how O
I O
have O
your O
number O
? O

I O

I O
was O
wondering O
about O
that O
. O

You O
talked O
to O
Dunya B-PERSON

No O

no O

well O
I O
did O
talk O
to O
Dunya B-PERSON

but O
she O
did O
n't O
give O

well O
actually O
she O
was O
n't O
there O
the O
day O
I O
called O

I O
talked O
to O
Ralph B-PERSON

but O
%um O
the O
last O
time O
I O
was O
in O
Honduras B-GPE
which O
is O
nearing O
two B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O
It O
's O
going O
to O
be O
two B-DATE
years I-DATE
in O
January B-DATE
. O
%um O
I O
saw O
your O
husband O
as O
I O
was O
leaving O
the O
airport O

and O
i- O
had O
my O
billfold O
out O

and O
he O
wrote O
it O
on O
this O
little O
pad O
in O
my O
billfold O

and O
you O
know O
what O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
things O

but O
I O
still O
have O
that O

oh O
my O
gosh O

So O
I O
thought O
well O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
advantage O
of O
it O
. O
So O
%ah O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
remember O
him O
telling O
me O
that O
he O
saw O
you O
. O

oh O
he O
probably O
spaced O
it O

I O
think O
he O
was O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
some O
kind O
of O
work O
project O
or O
something O
maybe O
where O
you O

picking O
up O
people O
from O
Peace B-ORG
Corps I-ORG
probably O

yeah O

Something O
like O
that O

yeah O

but O
that O
was O
right O
af- O

I O
mean O
that O
's O
a O
long O
time O
ago O

that O
was O
right O
after O
%um O
the O
change O
of O
the O
government O
. O

We O
were O
down O
because O
of O
that O
. O

%huh O

So O
anyway O

So O
three O
boys O
, O
Barb B-PERSON
. O

yeah O
. O

Wow O
. O

My O
hands O
are O
so O
full O

yeah O

I O
remember O
you O
said O
last O
time O
that O
the O
doctor O
said O
that O
you O
had O
to O
have O
a O
baby O
because O
of O
your O
ovaries O
or O
whatever O
just O
to O
keep O
everything O
in O
order O

Well O
if O
I O
wanted O
to O
have O
a O
child O
I O
should O
do O
it O
you O
know O

and O
so O
that O
pushed O
me O
. O

He O
said O
that O
we O
do O
n't O
want O
you O
to O
have O
a O
baby O
if O
it O
's O
going O
to O
create O
problems O

but O
if O
you O
want O
to O
have O
one O
this O
is O
the O
time O

and O
it O
actually O
so O
you O
went O
all O
out O
oh O
that O
's O
what O
it O
was O
did O
turn O
everything O
around O
for O
me O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
it O
works O
that O
way O
for O
everybody O

but O
those O
hormones O
kind O
of O
took O
care O
of O
the O
problems O
I O
was O
having O
. O

I O
was O
starting O
to O
have O
the O
problem O
again O
befo- O

like O
it O
was O
only O
maybe B-DATE
three I-DATE
months I-DATE
afterwards I-DATE
I O
got O
pregnant O

but O
I O
could O
already O
feel O
the O
pains O
and O
all O
that O

so O

Wow O
. O

I O
felt O
so O
good O
when O
I O
was O
pregnant O

I O
just O
felt O
like O
it O
was O
a O
miracle O

and O
then O

Really O
? O

oh O
yeah O

and O
then O
breast O
feeding O
those O
hormones O
also O
helped O

so O
I O
feel O
just O
fine O
. O

I O
hope O
I O
never O
have O
to O
deal O
with O
endometriosis O
again O

but O

two B-CARDINAL
girls O

oh O
%ah O
well O
, O
I O
thought O
I O
was O
done O
really O
after O
Thomas B-PERSON

not O
that O
I O
think O
two B-CARDINAL
is O
the O
perfect O
number O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
expect O
to O
get O
pregnant O
a O
third B-ORDINAL
time O

that O
happened O
when O
I O
was O
in O
Honduras B-GPE
last O
time O

that O
was O
really O
so O

mhm O

I O
was O
so O
angry O
at O
Oscar B-PERSON
that O
I O
just O
knew O
there O
was O
no O
way O
that O
I O
could O
ever O
even O
think O
of O
going O
to O
bed O
with O
him O
you O
know O

and O
that O
's O
when O
it O
happened O

but O
I O
love O
my O
little O
baby O

and O
-- O

%huh O

yeah O

but O

And O
you O
're O
still O
with O
Oscar B-PERSON
right O

that O
's O

well O
we O
're O
still O
married O

but O
he O
's O
doing O
his O
own O
thing O
like O
usual O

so O
I O
pretty O
much O
take O
care O
of O
the O
crew O
all O
alone O
. O

He O
calls O
to O
see O
how O
they O
're O
doing O
and O
%huh O
pops O
in O
every O
once O
in O
a O
while O
, O

but O
it O
's O
tough O
. O

It O
really O
is O

and O
see O
his O
daughter O
lives O
here O
too O

wow O

she O
's O
kin- O

She O
does O
? O

Well O
, O
she O
has O
since O

well O
I O
think O
they O
've O
been O
here O
five O
years O
now O
, O
five O
years O
this O
summer O
because O
we O
were O
figuring O
that O
they O
could O
apply O
for O
citizenship O
. O
Both O
Oscar B-PERSON
and O
Lehia B-PERSON
%um O
. O

He O
's O
twenty B-DATE

and O
she O
's O
just O
turned O
eighteen B-DATE
now O

Wow O
. O

he O
does O
n't O
live O
here O
%um O
. O

He O
had O
kind O
of O
, O

well O
, O
so O
it O
's O
a O
long O
long O
story O

but O
%um O
at O
one O
point O
when O
I O
got O
real O
irritated O
with O
Oscar B-PERSON
everybody O
in O
the O
family O
insisted O
that O
I O
was O
an O
idiot O
and O
I O
should O
make O
him O
take O
care O
of O
his O
children O
which O
you O
know O
I O
really O
believed O
when O
I O
was O
there O

and O
I O
mean O
it O
does O
make O
a O
lot O
of O
intellectual O
sense O
, O
I O
guess O
. O

But O
it O
really O

I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
do O
that O
to O
the O
kids O

but O
I O
did O

and O
so O
I O
sent O
them O
to O
stay O
with O
him O

and O
then O
I O
felt O
bad O
about O
it O
immediately O

and O
then O
he O
would O
n't O
let O
them O
come O
back O

and O
so O
it O
turned O
into O
a O
situation O
where O
Lehia B-PERSON
was O
really O
the O
one O
that O
wanted O
to O
come O
back O
and O
Oscar B-PERSON
junior O
kind O
of O
%um O
decided O
that O
living O
with O
his O
father O
was O
what O
he O
wanted O

mhm O

And O
Lehia B-PERSON
's O
mom O
used O
to O
beg O
him O
to O
let O
her O
come O
back O

and O
he O
'd O
say O
yes O

and O
then O
he O
'd O
hang O
up O
the O
phone O

and O
he O
'd O
say O
I O
'd O
never O
let O
you O
go O
back O
there O
you O
know O
. O

I O
mean O
it O
was O
real O
stupid O
. O

It O
was O
n't O
really O
that O
he O
wanted O
her O
around O

but O
it O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

People O
do O
stupid O
things O
. O

%hm O
. O

oh O

%hm O
so O
they O
're O
living O
with O
him O
? O

No O
, O

%um O
now O
how O
long O
? O

Probably O
two O
years O
ago O
then O
she O
and O
I O
worked O
it O
out O
where O
I O
got O
power O
of O
attorney O
from O
her O
mom O
because O
her O
mom O
always O
had O
custody O

and O
she O
called O
me O
one O
day O
when O
there O
was O
nobody O
in O
the O
house O
but O
her O

and O
I O
drove O
and O
got O
her O
and O
kind O
of O
stole O
her O
back O

it O
was O
kind O
of O
exciting O

I O
could O
n't O
believe O
that O
I O
'd O
ever O
do O
that O

but O
oh O
well O
it O
was O
very O
exciting O
actually O
because O
oh O
my O
gosh O
I O
mean O
I O
had O
to O
drive O
like O
two B-TIME
and I-TIME
half I-TIME
hours I-TIME

so O
you O
know O
you O
did O
n't O
know O

at O
any O
moment O
somebody O
might O
be O
coming O
home O
. O

I O
said O
get O
your O
stuff O
ready O

and O
I O
called O
her O
when O
I O
got O
to O
the O
corner O
, O
you O
know O
, O

it O
was O
really O
something O

and O
we O
just O
packed O
the O
car O
full O
. O

I O
mean O
there O
was O
n't O
one O
inch O
of O
space O
left O

and O
then O
we O
just O
flew O
out O
of O
there O
, O

and O
we O
went O
to O
the O
nearest O
McDonalds B-ORG
to O
kind O
of O
repack O
where O
we O
could O
breathe O
easy O

oh O
my O
gosh O
. O

It O
was O
pretty O
funny O

and O
then O
you O
know O
he O
never O
said O
a O
thing O
about O
it O
. O

yeah O

I O
know O
that O
he O
knew O
she O
was O
better O
off O
here O

and O
she O
had O
told O
me O
that O
she O
almost O
committed O
suicide O
once O

but O
you O
know O
he O
does O
n't O
even O
know O
any O
of O
it O
because O
it O
's O
not O
that O
he O
does O
n't O
care O
about O
his O
kids O
but O
he O
's O
not O
really O
capable O
of O
being O
a O
father O
. O

You O
know O
he O
just O
. O

%hm O

close O

So O
what O
's O
Lehia B-PERSON
doing O
? O

Is O
she O
studying O

or O
did O
she O
already O
graduate O
high O
school O
? O

She O
's O
going O
to O
be O
in O
her O
last O
year O
, O
of O
high O
school O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

And O
she O
's O
been O
with O
her O
mom O
for O
two B-DATE
months I-DATE

so O
she O
'll O
be O
coming O
back O
tomorrow B-DATE
. O
%um O

%ah O
. O

so O
that O
's O
what O
we O
have O
here O

and O
then O
he O
graduated O
one B-DATE
year I-DATE
ago I-DATE
from O
high O
school O

and O
he O
started O
going O
to O
school O
in O
Missouri B-GPE

and O
then O
just O
out O
of O
the O
blue O
he O
told O
me O
that O
he O
and O
his O
buddy O
wanted O
to O
move O
back O
to O
Omaha B-GPE
and O
go O
to O
school O
here O
which O
was O
really O
surprising O
and O
that O
he O
was O
kind O
of O
saying O
that O
living O
with O
his O
father O
was O
n't O
what O
you O
know O
, O
he O
kind O
of O
had O

his O
opinion O
on O
it O
had O
changed O
, O

but O
they O
wanted O
to O
live O
in O
an O
apartment O
. O

They O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
burden O
me O
anymore O
were O
his O
words O
, O

but O
you O
know O
I O
know O
it O
's O
that O
they O
want O
freedom O
, O
which O
is O
great O
. O

They O
're O
twenty B-CARDINAL
you O
know O
. O

%hm O

yeah O
. O

So O
they O
just O
moved O
in O
well O
no O
maybe O
farther O
, O
about O
a O
mile O
from O
us O

they O
live O
Wow O
. O
in O
an O
apartment O

and O
I O
hope O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
nice O
. O

His O
buddy O
is O
here O
actually O

and O
Oscar B-PERSON
is O
finishing O
some O
work O
that O
he O
was O
doing O

and O
then O
he O
's O
coming O
up O
sometime O
next B-DATE
week I-DATE

yeah O

but O
that O
's O
kind O
of O
in O
a O
nutshell O
all O
the O
things O
that O
have O
been O
going O
on O

and O

. O

Are O

you O
teaching O
? O

. O

Well O
I O
do O
n't O
teach O

%um O
I O

yeah O
? O

let O
's O
see O
, O

well O
I O
came O
back O

I O
taught O
adult O
basic O
education O
because O
it O
was O
really O
hard O
to O
get O
a O
job O
in O
home O
ec O
which O
is O

it O
's O
probably O
still O
that O
way O

and O
I O
went O
for O
my O
masters O
in O
counseling O

and O
uh-huh O
%um O
actually O
I O
was O
asked O
to O
come O
back O
and O
be O
the O
counselor O
at O
the O
American B-NORP
school O

and O
that O
was O
the O
year O
I O
was O
pregnant O
with O
Noel B-PERSON

and O
I O
was O
really O
torn O

I O
did O
n't O
know O
what O
to O
do O

but O
my O
doctor O
did O
n't O
want O
me O
to O
go O
back O
to O
Honduras B-GPE
because O
I O
'd O
been O
so O
sick O
before O
. O

He O
felt O
that O
y- O

mhm O
. O

I O
really O
needed O
. O

We O
did O
n't O
know O
how O
the O
pregnancy O
was O
going O
to O
go O

but O
I O
feel O
like O

I O
mean O
I O
was O
n't O
really O
paying O
that O
much O
attention O
to O
what O
he O
said O

but O
that O
did O
influence O
a O
little O
bit O
. O

so O
I O
did O
n't O
go O

%hm O
. O

and O
%uh O
, O
let O
's O
see O
, O

what O
would O
I O
, O

I O
guess O
I O
was O
working O
part O
time O
that O
year O
doing O
part O
time O
counseling O
jobs O

and O
then O
that B-DATE
next I-DATE
year I-DATE
well O
I O
had O
one B-CARDINAL
offer O
that O
I O
had O
to O
take O
. O

The O
other O
one O
was O
we O
were O
waiting O
for O
a O
principal O
to O
come O
back O
%um O

mhm O
. O

but O
I O
ended O
up O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
go O
into O
high O
school O
counseling O

but O
I O
could O
n't O
because O
the O
principal O
was O
out O
on O
this O
boat O
they O
told O
me O
and O
he O
had O
to O
make O
the O
decision O

it O
's O
like O
oh O
I O
need O
to O
know O
fast O
because O
I O
'm O
pregnant O
and O
I O
can O
not O
, O
you O
know O
, O
risk O
losing O
a O
job O
. O

So O
I O
ended O
up O
working O
at O
the O
Sure O
. O
community O
college O
which O
was O
n't O
what O
I O
wanted O
at O
the O
time O

but O
as O
it O
's O
turned O
out O
it O
probably O
was O
the O
best O
%um O

and O
I O
like O
it O
real O
well O
. O

I O
counseled O
for O
about O
five O
years O

and O
now O
I O
'm O
in O
administration O
%um O

oh O
great O
. O
