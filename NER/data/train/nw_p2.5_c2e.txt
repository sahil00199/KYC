The O

ECLAC O
-RRB- O
with O
its O
headquarters O
in O
Santiago O
issued O
a O
bulletin O
on O
the O
14th O
, O
noting O
that O
the O
economic O
growth O
rate O
of O
Latin O
America O
and O
the O
Caribbean O
regions O
will O
reach O
5.3 O
% O
in O
2006 O
, O
but O
the O
economic O
growth O
rate O
of O
this O
area O
would O
slow O
down O
to O
4.7 O
% O
in O
2007 O
. O

According O
to O
the O
bulletin O
, O
the O
annual O
economic O
growth O
rate O
in O
Latin O

and O
the O
Caribbean O

stood O
at O
an O
average O
of O
2.2 O
% O
per O
year O
between O
1980 O
and O
2002 O
; O
thereafter O
, O
the O
region O
witnessed O
four O
consecutive O
years O
of O
relatively O
rapid O
growth O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
as O
compared O
to O
other O
developing O
countries O
and O
regions O
, O
economic O
growth O
in O
Latin O
America O
and O
the O
Caribbean O
regions O
is O
still O
considerably O
slow O
. O

ECLAC O
believed O
that O
the O
favorable O
global O
environment O
boosted O
total O
exports O
from O
the O
countries O
in O
Latin O
America O
and O
the O
Caribbean O
regions O
to O
increase O
by O
8.4 O
% O
this O
year O
, O
and O
this O
was O
one O
of O
the O
factors O
that O
spurred O
economic O
growth O
in O
the O
region O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
with O
strengthened O
confidence O
in O
investors O
and O
consumers O
, O
an O
increase O
in O
overseas O
remittance O
and O
public O
expenditures O
, O
and O
a O
rising O
employment O
rate O
that O
boosted O
total O
wages O
, O
domestic O
demand O
had O
strengthened O
in O
the O
countries O
of O
this O
region O
, O
which O
had O
in O
turn O
witnessed O
further O
economic O
growth O
. O

The O
Commission O
believes O
that O
the O
international O
environment O
of O
next O
year O
will O
remain O
conducive O

economic O
development O
in O

According O
to O
news O
from O
Bogota O
, O
Columbia O
and O
the O
US O
today O
signed O
a O
free O
- O
trade O
pact O
. O

But O
it O
is O
still O
not O
clear O
whether O
the O
trade O
agreement O
will O
be O
approved O
by O
the O
currently O
- O
Democratic O
- O
controlled O
US O
Congress O
. O

Although O
US O
Democrats O
do O
n't O
oppose O
the O
free O
- O
trade O
pact O
, O
some O
of O
the O
party O
's O
leaders O
have O
previously O
said O
they O
want O
to O
add O
more O
content O
relating O
to O
labor O
and O
environmental O
restrictions O
to O
treaties O
reached O
with O
other O
countries O
. O

The O
initialing O
of O
the O
free O
trade O
pact O
between O
the O
two O
countries O
took O
place O
at O
the O
headquarters O
of O
the O
Inter-American O
Development O
Bank O
. O

It O
can O
then O
become O
valid O
once O
approved O
by O
the O
two O
countries O
' O
congresses O
. O

The O
US O
trade O
representative O
and O
Columbian O
minister O
of O
trade O
, O

and O
tourism O
signed O
the O
treaty O
. O

Regarding O
the O
difficulties O
that O
would O
occur O
when O
the O
free O
trade O
pact O
was O
handed O
over O
to O
the O
new O
US O
Congress O
, O
Columbian O
President O
Uribe O
said O
that O
it O
was O
" O
necessary O
" O
that O
Congress O
pass O
this O
trade O
agreement O
. O

Many O
investors O
are O
placing O
their O
hopes O
on O
the O
free O
trade O
pact O
because O
it O
is O
the O
final O
agreement O
that O
would O
assure O
long O

entry O
into O

According O
to O

coming O
out O
of O
the O
International O

on O
Underground O

that O
closed O
a O
few O

Beijing O
's O
2nd O

will O
, O
from O
now O
on O
, O
primarily O
consist O
in O
the O
future O
of O
flat O
surface O
pedestrian O
crosswalks O
and O
underground O
street O
- O
crossing O
facilities O
. O

In O
principle O
, O
pedestrian O
overpass O
will O
not O
be O
used O
anymore O
. O

We O
do O
n't O
know O
when O
pedestrian O
overpasses O
started O
to O
become O
popular O
in O
Chinese O
cities O
. O

Even O
the O
capital O
city O
Beijing O
was O
unable O
to O
rise O
above O
the O
convention O
. O

In O
many O
places O
, O
pedestrian O
overpasses O
have O
become O
people O
's O
main O
or O
even O
their O
only O
choice O
to O
cross O
the O
streets O
. O

But O
in O
reality O
pedestrian O
overpasses O
truly O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
drawbacks O
. O

The O
overpasses O
are O
so O
high O
and O
the O
stairways O
so O
long O
that O
climbing O
them O
takes O
a O
lot O
of O
energy O
. O

This O
point O
alone O
has O
seen O
them O
branded O
as O
dehumanizing O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
pedestrian O
overpasses O
have O
carved O
up O
the O
urban O
space O
and O
had O
a O
massive O
impact O
on O
the O
city O
landscape O
. O

Various O
types O
of O
drawbacks O
have O
caused O
many O
pedestrian O
overpasses O
in O
Beijing O
to O
be O
in O
an O
unwelcome O
state O
and O
we O
believe O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
are O
deeply O
bothered O
. O

Similar O
situations O
are O
likewise O
occurring O
in O
many O
cities O
and O
in O
recent O
years O
many O

have O
started O

This O
has O

been O
the O

in O

It O
is O
not O
difficult O
to O

out O

" O
nor O
is O
it O
difficult O
to O

down O
" O

" O
on O

. O

What O
is O
difficult O
is O
putting O
it O
into O
practice O
. O

The O
" O
distance O
of O

" O
of O
taking O
" O

" O
off O
the O

the O

involves O
the O
distribution O
and O
redistribution O
of O
a O
huge O
number O

. O

It O
involves O
a O
reallocation O
of O

. O

It O
involves O
cars O

non-public O
means O
of O

. O

Different O
departments O
have O
prescribed O
different O
treatments O
for O
urban O
gridlock O
, O
such O
as O
building O
more O
streets O
and O
rail O
lines O
, O
and O
adding O
to O
city O
infrastructure O
. O

These O
are O
only O
some O
" O
hardware O
" O
conditions O
. O

But O
concept O
shift O
, O
improving O
management O
and O
raising O
efficiency O
are O
" O
software O
" O
factors O
that O
truly O
can O
not O
be O
ignored O
. O

At O
present O
the O
cost O
of O
building O
a O
subway O
is O
300 O
- O
500 O
million O
yuan O
per O
kilometer O
. O

But O
based O
on O
the O
experience O
of O
Hangzhou O
City O
, O
the O
cost O
of O
28 O
kilometers O
of O
high O
- O
speed O
surface O
public O
transport O
is O
only O
200 O
million O
yuan O
in O
total O
, O
less O
than O
the O
construction O
costs O
of O
one O
kilometer O
of O
subway O
. O

From O
the O
perspective O
of O
construction O
cycle O
, O
a O
city O
constructs O
no O
more O
than O
3 O
- O
5 O
kilometers O
of O
rail O
lines O
in O
a O
year O
. O

Building O
a O
rail O
network O
of O
several O
hundred O
kilometers O
requires O
many O
decades O
. O

But O
by O
constructing O
high O
- O
speed O
public O
transport O
, O
an O
effective O
transport O
network O
can O
be O
formed O
within O
the O
term O
of O
office O
of O
a O

government O
. O

Looked O
at O
it O
in O
this O
way O
, O
if O
you O
want O
to O
relieve O
gridlock O
, O
you O
can O
not O
value O
investment O
only O
and O
ignore O
management O

The O

be O

and O
resolved O
at O
the O

The O
two O

out O
that O

from O

of O

upon O
during O

that O
was O

in O

it O
is O

that O
in O
the O
next O
two O
to O
three O
years O
, O
funds O
that O
need O
to O
be O
set O
aside O
for O
preventive O
efforts O
ought O
to O
be O
increased O
by O
986 O

Looking O
at O
the O
current O
situation O
of O
domestic O
and O
international O
video O
search O
engines O
, O
it O
can O
be O
seen O
that O
the O
scope O
for O
development O
is O
tremendous O
, O
and O
its O
future O
prospects O
is O
also O
very O
optimistic O
. O

But O
in O
terms O
of O
its O
development O
path O
, O
whether O
to O
continue O
to O
use O
the O
development O
model O
of O
traditional O
search O
engines O
, O
or O
more O
exciting O
and O
innovative O
moves O
might O
be O
initiated O
, O
remains O
much O
to O
be O
seen O
and O
anticipated O
. O

But O
no O
matter O
to O
what O
extent O
the O
Internet O
develops O
, O
text O
content O
will O
still O
constitute O
the O
mainstream O
, O
as O
its O
data O
amount O
will O
overwhelmingly O
exceed O
that O
of O
video O
content O
. O

Therefore O
, O
text O
searches O
can O
reach O
the O
level O
of O
" O
when O
there O
is O
a O
question O
, O
let O
's O
Baidu O
" O
, O
because O
text O
content O
on O
the O
Internet O
virtually O
covers O
all O
the O
information O
that O
we O
require O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
. O

But O
video O
contents O
are O
some O
different O
, O
as O
their O
cost O
of O
production O
is O
much O
higher O
than O
that O
of O
text O
contents O
, O
as O
are O
the O
costs O
of O
storage O
and O
transmission O
. O

Therefore O
, O
video O
searches O
should O
be O
classified O
as O
vertical O
searches O
, O
and O
as O
compared O
to O
words O
, O
their O
search O
area O
is O
easier O
to O
circumscribe O
. O

Judging O
from O
the O
current O
situation O
, O
most O
video O
search O
engines O
have O
adopted O
a O
relatively O
professional O
path O
. O

But O
one O
point O
can O
be O
certain O
: O
marketing O
competition O
among O
search O
engines O
will O
become O
more O
intense O
, O
while O
community O
searches O
and O
video O
searches O
have O
become O
the O
new O
hot O
spots O
of O
the O
search O
engine O
industry O
. O

Traditional O
search O
engine O
giants O
have O
entered O
the O
market O
, O
and O
newly O
emerged O
search O
engine O
service O
providers O
have O
further O
seized O
upon O

, O
community O
searches O
and O
the O
like O
as O
excellent O
opportunities O
for O
them O
to O
overtake O
the O
traditional O
giants O
. O

2007 O
will O
be O
a O
decisive O
year O
of O
battle O
for O
the O

30th O
that O
the O
statement O
regarding O
US O
- O
British O
relations O
made O
a O
few O
days O
earlier O
by O
Kendall O
Myers O
, O
an O
official O
with O
the O
US O
State O
Department O
's O
Bureau O
of O
Intelligence O
and O
Research O
, O
was O
mistaken O
and O
did O
not O
reflect O
the O
position O
of O
the O
US O
government O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
Casey O
also O
spoke O
in O
defense O
of O
the O
" O
special O
relationship O
" O
between O
the O
US O
and O
the O
UK O
. O

He O
said O
that O
US O
- O
Anglo O
relations O
were O
very O
unique O
and O
that O
if O
the O
US O
- O
Anglo O
relationship O
did O
not O
exist O
, O
the O
world O
would O
be O
worse O
off O
. O

According O
to O
reports O
by O
US O
media O
, O
Myers O
said O
during O
a O
speech O
at O
John O
- O
Hopkins O
University O
in O
Washington O
that O
relations O
between O
Britain O
and O
the O
US O
were O
" O
completely O
a O
one O
- O
sided O
relationship O
" O
and O
that O
Britain O
's O
role O
as O
a O
bridge O
between O
the O
US O
and O
Europe O
was O
" O
currently O
disappearing O
before O
our O
eyes O
" O
. O

He O
pointed O
out O
that O
although O
Britain O
attempts O
to O
influence O
US O
foreign O
policy O
, O
the O
US O
" O
had O
closed O
its O
eyes O
" O
to O
it O
. O

Recently O
, O
I O
could O
n't O
resist O
the O
temptation O
, O
and O
I O
followed O
fashion O
and O
invested O
several O
thousand O
yuan O
into O
getting O
a O
gas O
card O
from O
one O
of O
the O
big O
state O
companies O
. O

They O
promised O
in O
their O
advertisements O
that O
the O
service O
would O
be O
value O
plus O
. O

Very O
quickly O
I O
became O
greatly O
troubled O
by O
this O
" O
value O
plus O
" O
service O
. O

I O
am O
a O
person O
who O
plans O
my O
expenditure O
carefully O
, O
and O
experts O
all O
explain O
that O
each O
time O
that O
a O
gas O
tank O
is O
not O
filled O
to O
capacity O
, O
the O
car O
will O
save O
a O
bit O
of O
gas O
. O

The O
first O
time O
I O
used O
the O
gas O
card O
, O
I O
told O
the O
gas O
attendant O
to O
" O
put O
in O
one O
hundred O
. O
" O

He O
put O
in O
the O
nozzle O
and O
filled O
it O
up O
to O
one O
hundred O
and O
seventy O
until O
I O
screamed O
out O
. O

Then O
he O
said O
with O
an O
innocent O
face O
, O
" O
I O
thought O
you O
wanted O
a O
fill O
- O
up O
. O
" O

The O
first O
time O
could O
have O
been O
lack O
of O
experience O
, O
but O
the O
second O
time O
, O
and O
the O
third O
time O
were O
both O
the O
same O
. O

Once O
you O
use O
the O
card O
, O
they O
will O
do O
everything O
they O
can O
to O
give O
you O
" O
value O
plus O
" O
by O
adding O
more O
. O

I O
'm O
a O
veteran O
driver O
with O
more O
than O
10 O
years O
of O
experience O
, O
so O
I O
know O
that O
gas O
pumps O
can O
be O
preset O
. O

It O
's O
true O
that O
when O
I O
take O
out O
100 O
yuan O
in O
cash O
, O
they O
would O
want O
to O
stop O
the O
nozzle O
at O
99 O
yuan O
, O
but O
once O
you O
swipe O
a O
card O
-- O
must O
be O
a O
big O
customer O
?! O

They O
can O
put O
in O
as O
much O
as O
they O
want O
. O

XX O

See O
, O
I O
have O
again O
encountered O
this O
" O
value O
plus O
" O
gas O
purchase O
matter O
at O
two O
of O
the O
company O
's O
Beijing O
gas O
stations O
within O
the O
recent O
nine O
days O
. O

They O
all O
had O
the O
same O
attitude O
: O
" O
Sorry O
, O
I O
heard O
wrong O
" O
or O
" O
I O
forgot O
. O
" O

I O
could O
n't O
help O
calling O
the O
customer O
service O
hotline O
twice O
to O
angrily O
complain O
. O

They O
explained O
that O
it O
was O
sub-standard O
service O
and O
then O
added O
, O
" O
Anyway O
, O
the O
extra O
gas O
is O
in O
your O
gas O
tank O
, O
so O
there O
is O
no O
loss O
, O
right O
? O
" O

You O
see O
, O
it O
's O
as O
if O
I O
were O
in O
a O
restaurant O
and O
I O
clearly O
ordered O
half O
a O
catty O
of O
steamed O
meat O
buns O
, O
but O
they O
squeezed O
a O
catty O
into O
my O
mouth O
, O
and O
then O
said O
, O
" O
Anyway O
, O
you O
have O
eaten O
your O
lunch O
and O
dinner O
all O
at O
once O
, O
so O
you O
just O
saved O
yourself O
some O
trouble O
. O

According O

some O

More O
than O
60 O
years O
ago O
, O
when O
the O

was O
introduced O
, O
it O
was O

" O

" O

But O
not O
long O
after O

were O
intoxicated O
by O
their O
victory O

, O
they O
came O
to O
the O
realization O
that O
" O
when O
the O
good O
advances O
by O
one O
step O
, O
its O
evil O
counterpart O
will O
advance O
by O
several O
steps O
. O
" O

The O
speed O
of O
the O
growth O
of O

- O

obviously O
outpaces O
the O
speed O
of O
human O

to O
develop O

. O

World O
Health O

experts O
are O
now O
even O
worried O
that O
" O
a O
super O
all O
- O
drug O
- O

new O
bacteria O
will O
bring O
human O

back O
to O
an O
era O
when O
infectious O
disease O
raged O
. O
" O

The O
birth O
of O
super O
bacteria O
is O
caused O
by O
man O
's O
excessive O
use O
of O
antibiotics O
when O
they O
are O
sick O
. O

There O
are O
two O
dangers O
in O
the O
excessive O
use O
of O
antibiotics O
: O
first O
, O
it O
" O
strengthens O
the O
enemy O
group O
. O
" O

Currently O
, O
antibiotics O
can O
not O
eliminate O
some O
" O
new O
generation O
" O
drug O
- O
resistant O
bacteria O
. O

In O
1928 O
, O
when O
the O
forefather O
of O
antibiotics O
- O
penicillin O
- O
was O
launched O
, O
it O
seemed O
invincible O
, O
but O
now O
, O
it O
is O
getting O
old O
and O
weak O
. O

Now O
, O
even O
the O
top O
antibiotic O
brand O
vancomycin O
is O
also O
challenged O
by O
the O
new O
generation O
Staphylococcus O

. O

Right O
now O
, O
the O
United O

has O
to O
spend O
two O
to O
four O
billion O
U.S. O
Dollars O
each O
year O
to O
fight O
the O
anti-drug O
bacteria O
. O

And O
what O
is O
most O
shocking O
is O
the O
birth O
of O
" O
super O
bacteria O
" O
that O
feed O
on O
antibiotics O
. O

Secondly O
, O
it O
" O
undermines O
the O
united O
front O
. O
" O

There O
are O
many O
healthy O
bacteria O
living O
in O
the O
human O
body O
, O
but O
the O
excessive O
use O
of O
antibiotics O
will O
kill O
these O
" O
allies O
, O
" O
leading O
to O
a O
loss O
of O
alignment O
among O
the O
bacteria O
groups O
, O
and O
hence O
allowing O
anti-drug O
bacteria O
to O
get O
a O
chance O
. O

Some O
of O
them O
may O
cause O
pseudomembranous O
colitis O
, O
which O
has O
a O
death O
rate O
as O
high O
as O
20 O

, O
while O
others O
may O
lead O

? O

Those O

of O
the O
European O

continue O
to O
keep O
raising O
questions O
. O

Indeed O
, O
for O
Cannavaro O
, O
after O
the O
World O
Cup O
, O
his O
second O
half O
of O
the O
year O
in O
the O
Spanish O
first O
division O
competition O
was O
an O
absolute O
disaster O
. O

His O
play O
with O
Real O
Madrid O
was O
extremely O
unstable O
and O
on O
several O
occasions O
his O
stupid O
mistakes O
led O
to O
the O
team O
's O
loss O
of O
the O
game O
. O

It O
did O
n't O
look O
at O
all O
like O
the O
performance O
of O
an O
European O
Footballer O
of O
the O
Year O
. O

But O
people O
familiar O
with O
the O
selection O
of O
the O
European O
Footballer O
of O
the O
Year O
know O
that O
what O
the O
FIFA O
award O
puts O
the O
most O
emphasis O
on O
is O
the O
scores O
in O
FIFA O
- O
organized O
competitions O
. O

This O
is O
why O
once O
a O
World O
Cup O
year O
rolls O
around O
, O
the O
award O
winner O
is O
sure O
to O
be O
a O
key O
player O
from O
the O
World O
Cup O
champion O
team O
. O

Among O
the O
new O
Italian O
World O
Cup O
champion O
team O
, O
the O
midfield O
and O
forward O
players O
were O
unconvincing O
, O
so O
Cannavaro O
was O
naturally O
the O
most O
suitable O
choice O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
Ronaldinho O
could O
be O
selected O
as O
European O
Footballer O
of O
the O
Year O
last O
year O
was O
to O

Australian O
astrophysicist O
Rodney O
Marks O
mysteriously O
died O
in O
Antarctica O
in O
2000 O
. O

Since O
this O
may O
be O
the O
first O
recorded O
murder O
case O
that O
has O
occurred O
in O
Antarctica O
, O
New O

police O
are O
continuing O
to O
open O
the O
investigation O
of O
the O
case O
. O

The O
New O
Zealand O
police O
claimed O
that O
32 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
Rodney O
died O
at O
the O
" O
Scott O
- O
Amundsen O
Sea O
Antarctic O
Research O
Station O
" O
probably O
because O
someone O
intentionally O
killed O
him O
by O
poison O
. O

Preliminary O
autopsy O
results O
show O
that O
Rodney O
died O
from O
methanol O
poisoning O
. O

Recent O
progress O
in O
investigations O
of O
the O
case O
discovered O
that O
Rodney O
loved O
drinking O
, O
and O
often O
used O
alcohol O
to O
control O
his O
Tourette O
syndrome O
, O
an O
inherited O
neurological O
disorder O
. O

Methanol O
is O
a O
fuel O
for O
internal O
combustion O
engine O
. O

Getting O
a O
cup O
of O
methanol O
into O
the O
body O
either O
through O
drinking O
, O
skin O
, O
or O
breathing O
is O
lethal O
. O

Police O
authorities O
had O
believed O
once O
that O
Rodney O
might O
have O
died O
from O
suicide O
, O
but O
such O
possibility O
was O
quickly O
ruled O
out O
, O
because O
the O
decedent O
was O
building O
an O
intimate O
relationship O
with O
a O
woman O
before O
he O
died O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
he O
was O
positive O
and O
optimistic O
, O
and O
got O
along O
well O
with O
his O
colleagues O
at O
the O
research O
station O
. O

He O
did O
not O
have O
any O
financial O
problems O
either O
. O

After O
six O
years O
of O
investigation O
, O
the O
New O
Zealand O
police O
have O
recently O
re-summoned O
the O
coroner O
for O
questions O
because O
no O
confirmed O
evidence O
has O
been O
found O
so O
far O
to O
prove O
how O
the O
" O
murderer O
" O
" O
got O
" O
the O
methanol O
into O
the O
decedent O
's O
body O
. O

However O

efforts O

protect O

have O
already O
become O
a O
social O
consensus O
from O
all O
fields O

After O
the O

explicitly O
spelled O
out O
the O
theory O
of O
developing O
and O
constructing O
cultural O

the O
cultural O

According O

the O

for O
our O

The O
current O
condition O

the O

French O
is O

speak O
not O
only O
English O
, O

Therefore O
, O
the O
first O
difficulty O
faced O
by O

moon O
after O

assumed O

was O
that O
his O
French O

not O
good O

Even O
though O

had O
exerted O
some O

French O
, O
still O
during O
the O

after O

when O

quite O
some O

after O

heard O
out O
the O

with O
a O

that O
if O

he O
could O
handle O

but O
he O
definitely O
could O
not O

the O

By O

it O
was O

that O
his O

Stanford O

Prof. O
Aboujaoude O
said O
, O
" O
In O
the O
past O
three O
or O
four O
years O
, O
we O
frequently O
have O
patients O
coming O
to O
our O
hospital O
for O
treatment O
, O
saying O
that O
the O
Internet O
has O
really O
negatively O
affected O
them O
. O

He O
said O
, O
" O
They O
were O
fired O
because O
of O
excessive O
use O
of O
the O
Internet O
, O
and O
their O
spouses O
had O
also O
threatened O
to O
divorce O
them O
. O

He O
said O
, O
" O
At O
first O
, O
they O
tried O
to O
prove O
that O
their O
behavior O
was O
reasonable O
. O

However O
, O
when O
some O
major O
events O
happened O
, O
they O
then O
began O
to O
understand O
the O
real O
situation O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
only O
when O
they O
were O
disciplined O
or O
dismissed O
from O
their O
jobs O
, O
or O
when O
their O
wives O
or O
husbands O
threatened O
to O
leave O
them O
, O
did O
they O
then O
understand O
that O
the O
behavior O
that O
superfacially O
seems O
harmless O
had O
already O
brought O
them O
a O
host O
of O
problems O
. O

The O
types O
of O

that O
frequently O
lead O
to O
problems O
may O
not O
be O
the O
most O
obvious O

Online O

Prof. O

warned O
that O

stem O

Recently O
, O
in O
light O
of O
increasingly O
serious O
network O
infiltrations O
by O
hackers O
, O
the O
US O
Defense O
Department O
and O
its O
subordinate O
agencies O
have O
taken O
actions O
one O
after O
the O
other O
to O
carefully O
detect O
hacker O
infiltration O
. O

Last O
month O
, O
the O
College O
of O
Naval O
Warfare O
in O
Newport O
, O
Rhode O
Island O
immediately O
shut O
down O
the O
college O
's O
network O
after O
indications O
of O
a O
hacker O
infiltration O
were O
discovered O
. O

Now O
, O
it O
is O
the O
turn O
of O
the O
US O
National O
Defense O
University O
. O

According O
to O
reports O
, O
the O
computer O
network O
system O
of O
the O
National O
Defense O
University O
has O
been O
completely O
shut O
down O
and O
a O
comprehensive O
search O
is O
underway O
for O
traces O
of O
a O
hacker O
infiltration O
. O

On O
the O
surface O
, O
the O
situations O
at O
the O
National O
Defense O
University O
and O
the O
College O
of O
Naval O
Warfare O
differed O
somewhat O
and O
prior O
to O
them O
no O
suspicious O
indications O
had O
been O
found O
. O

The O
one O
- O
month O
shutdown O
of O
the O
network O
is O
for O
the O
so O
- O
called O
" O
maintenance O
" O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
the O
schools O
have O
not O
made O
public O
any O
details O
. O

But O
some O
analysts O
say O
that O
the O
National O
Defense O
University O
's O
network O
was O
indeed O
infiltrated O
by O
hackers O
, O
although O
no O
concrete O
evidence O
has O
been O
found O
so O
far O
. O

The O
US O
has O
agencies O
that O
specialize O
in O
developing O
infiltration O
tools O
and O
that O
are O
specifically O
responsible O
for O
researching O
hackers O
. O

Researchers O
have O
found O
that O
the O
amount O
of O
high O
level O
infiltration O
is O
rapidly O
increasing O
. O

They O
are O
normally O
able O
to O
enter O
and O
exit O
a O
network O
system O
without O
leaving O
a O
trace O
. O

The O
computer O
of O
the O
National O
Defense O
University O
holds O
a O
large O
amount O
of O
important O
data O
. O

If O
it O
was O
indeed O
infiltrated O
by O
hackers O
, O
it O
will O
also O
be O
necessary O
to O
find O
out O
the O
time O
of O
the O
infiltration O
and O
the O
details O
of O
the O
stolen O
data O
. O

Then O
the O
difficulty O
of O
the O
work O
will O
become O
even O
greater O
. O

Judging O
from O

" O

On O
the O

, O
" O

is O
an O
issue O
of O

But O
in O

it O
is O
a O

President O

Wilson O
said O
, O
" O
We O
are O
praying O
wholeheartedly O
for O

and O
God O
will O
send O
us O
a O
blessing O
from O
heaven O
. O

He O
said O
, O
" O
Farmers O
have O
suffered O
grievously O
from O
the O
drought O
, O
so O
we O
are O
joining O
the O
farmers O
in O
praying O
together O
for O
rain O
. O

We O
want O
the O
farmers O
to O
know O
that O
even O
if O
other O
people O
have O
not O
been O
harmed O
directly O
from O
the O
drought O
, O
they O
also O
understand O
the O
agonizing O
struggle O
of O
their O
fellow O
farmers O
at O
this O
moment O
. O

New O
South O
Wales O
Farmers O
Association O
President O
Laurie O
said O
that O
at O
a O
time O
when O
agricultural O
crops O
over O
a O
large O
swath O
of O
the O
country O
had O
been O
damaged O
, O
a O
rainfall O
would O
stimulate O
morale O
and O
the O
will O
to O
fight O
. O

He O
said O
that O
while O
it O
was O
clear O
that O
for O
most O
land O
rain O
would O
now O
not O
seem O
to O
be O
of O
very O
much O
use O
, O
but O
for O
some O
land O
a O
rainfall O
would O
benefit O
the O
growth O
of O
forage O
grass O
that O
is O
for O
feeding O
livestock O
. O

Laurie O
said O
he O
thought O
that O
the O
nation O
- O
wide O
prayer O
for O
rain O
would O
illustrate O
that O
urban O
residents O
are O
beginning O
to O
understand O
the O
impact O
of O
the O
drought O
in O
rural O
regions O
. O

We O
must O
persist O
in O
putting O
the O
" O
Three O
Rural O
Issues O
" O
in O
a O
prominent O
position O
in O
the O
overall O
situation O
of O
economic O
and O
social O
development O
. O

This O
is O
an O
important O
and O
new O
realization O
and O
understanding O
that O
we O
arrived O
at O
in O
the O
process O
of O
implementing O
the O
concept O
of O
scientific O
development O
. O

It O
is O
extremely O
specific O
and O
instructive O
in O
nature O
. O

In O
recent O
years O
, O
the O
central O
government O
has O
adopted O
a O
series O
of O
valid O
policies O
to O
solve O
the O
" O
Three O
Rural O
Issues O
" O
. O

The O
relatively O
good O
agricultural O
situation O
and O
stable O
growth O
in O
grain O
production O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
steady O
increase O
in O
peasants O
' O
harvest O
, O
have O
provided O
important O
support O
for O
smooth O
and O
rapid O
economic O
and O
social O
development O
, O
giving O
us O
the O
initiative O
in O
overall O
planning O
. O

But O
we O
must O
also O
understand O
that O
there O
still O
exist O
many O
problems O
in O
the O
work O
on O
the O
" O
Three O
Rurals O
" O
. O

Peasants O
' O
earnings O
from O
grain O
crops O
have O
decreased O
, O
damaging O
the O
production O
motivation O
. O

The O
agricultural O
base O
is O
weak O
and O
its O
ability O
to O
resist O
disasters O
is O
n't O
strong O
, O
making O
it O
more O
difficult O
for O
peasants O
to O
increase O
harvests O
. O

With O
continued O
bumper O
harvests O
in O
agriculture O
and O
a O
quite O
good O
economic O
situation O
, O
there O
has O
appeared O
a O
tendency O
to O
relax O
in O
agriculture O
and O
in O
particular O
to O
relax O
in O
the O
production O
of O
grains O
. O

A O
high O
level O
of O
attention O
should O
be O
paid O
to O
these O
problems O

A O

on O
the O

forecasts O
that O
the O
Japanese O

will O
continue O
to O
maintain O
growth O
momentum O
in O
the O

year O
. O

After O
excluding O

, O
the O
real O
growth O
rate O
of O
the O
Japanese O
economy O
in O
the O
2007 O
fiscal O
year O
will O
reach O
2 O
% O
, O
making O
it O
the O
sixth O
year O
in O
a O
row O
that O
growth O
has O
been O
maintained O
. O

The O
report O
by O
the O
Cabinet O
Office O
says O
that O
in O
the O
2007 O
fiscal O
year O
, O
Japan O
will O
see O
growth O
in O
its O
average O
aggregate O
price O
and O
will O
completely O
shake O
off O
deflation O
. O

Prior O
to O
this O
, O
the O
Japanese O
government O
forecasted O
that O
commodity O
price O
in O
the O
2006 O
fiscal O
year O
would O
enter O
a O
period O
in O
which O
the O
nominal O
growth O
rate O
would O
surpass O
the O
real O
growth O
rate O
. O

But O
judging O
from O
the O
current O
situation O
, O
owing O
to O
slow O
growth O
in O
commodity O
price O
as O
well O
as O
other O
reasons O
, O
this O
goal O
actually O
can O
no O
longer O
be O
realized O
. O

This O
indicates O
that O
the O
government O
had O
already O
lost O
confidence O
in O
shaking O
off O
deflation O
in O
the O
2006 O
fiscal O
year O
. O

The O
reports O
says O
that O
with O
the O
gradual O
rise O
in O
employment O
and O
personal O
income O
, O
Japanese O
household O
expenditure O
will O
show O
growth O
. O

After O
entering O
the O
2007 O
fiscal O
year O
, O
the O
Japanese O
economy O
, O
pulled O
along O
by O
good O
corporate O
results O

led O
by O

demand O
, O
will O
continue O
to O
look O
upbeat O

the O

not O

that O
