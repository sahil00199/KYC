The O
radio O
station O
also O
provided O
a O
telephone O
number O
for O
complaints O
, O
instigating O
people O
daily O
to O
complain O
. O

What O
do O
complaints O
mean O
? O

Are O
n't O
they O
words O
from O
Hong O
Kong O
and O
Taiwan O
? O

There O
are O
petition O
offices O
everywhere O
at O
our O
leaders O
' O
location O
, O
and O
naturally O
there O
will O
be O
people O
designated O
to O
receive O
letters O
and O
visits O
of O
the O
average O
people O
in O
an O
extremely O
friendly O
and O
cordial O
manner O
. O

There O
's O
no O
need O
for O
a O
radio O
station O
to O
be O
such O
a O
nosy O
parker O
as O
to O
mind O
others O
' O
business O
. O

Actually O
I O
've O
known O
for O
a O
long O
time O
that O
by O
their O
so O
- O
called O
accepting O
complaints O
, O
the O
radio O
station O
is O
intentionally O
collecting O
unfavorable O
and O
negative O
things O
for O
public O
release O
. O

They O
do O
love O
a O
good O
panic O
. O

There O
's O
plenty O
of O
positive O
news O
in O
Nanjing O
, O
which O
I O
've O
never O
seen O
=it O
report O
. O

For O
example O
, O
Nanjing O
's O
No. O
2 O
and O
No. O
3 O
bridges O
are O
magnificent O
and O
fast O
, O
but O
=it O
would O
rather O
focus O
on O
the O
traffic O
jam O
on O
the O
No. O
1 O
Bridge O
. O

The O
marina O
in O
Hexi O
is O
so O
wide O
and O
broad O
that O
even O
a O
plane O
can O
take O
off O
and O
land O
, O
let O
alone O
driving O
a O
car O
. O

Instead O
of O
discussing O
such O
, O
=it O
would O
rather O
focus O
on O
those O
jammed O
junctions O
. O

Nanjing O
leads O
the O
nation O
in O
various O
aspects O
. O

Instead O
of O
publicizing O
such O
, O
=it O
would O
rather O
instigate O
average O
people O
to O
complain O
enthusiastically O
.... O

Who O
does O
n't O
make O
a O
minor O
mistake O
? O

This O
is O
indeed O
finding O
quarrel O
in O
a O
straw O
. O

I O
suppose O
that O
petroleum O
hedge O
funds O
, O
having O
already O
brought O
down O
the O
US O
, O
are O
probably O
now O
looking O
for O
the O
next O
target O
. O

Internationally O
, O
those O
hedge O
funds O
will O
not O
easily O
loosen O
their O
grip O
on O
petroleum O
growth O
stock O
, O
allowing O
the O
trillions O
of O
American O
dollars O
in O
our O
hands O
to O
buy O
even O
more O
oil O
. O

Perhaps O
they O
will O
always O
keep O
the O
oil O
price O
high O
, O
until O
the O
point O
where O
China O
takes O
its O
hands O
off O
oil O
prices O
. O

If O
this O
happens O
, O
the O
issue O
of O
when O
house O
prices O
will O
fall O
turns O
into O
an O
issue O
of O
when O
domestic O
oil O
prices O
are O
let O
loose O
. O

If O
our O
oil O
prices O
fall O
into O
line O
with O
international O
ones O
, O
the O
outcome O
of O
this O
would O
be O
that O
domestic O
real O
estate O
prices O
dive O
. O
Because O
the O
high O
house O
price O
foundation O
that O
is O
derived O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
existing O
economic O
operating O
efficiency O
would O
be O
totally O
lost O
. O

We O
could O
n't O
possibly O
see O
the O
other O
situation O
described O
by O
well O
- O
known O
national O
economists O
: O
the O
rise O
in O
oil O
prices O
drives O
house O
prices O
to O
go O
on O
advancing O
, O
because O
the O
rise O
in O
the O
price O
of O
raw O
materials O
causes O
widespread O
inflation O
to O
occur O
, O
and O
inflationary O
pressure O
then O
promotes O
house O
price O
escalation O
. O

If O
that O
was O
the O
case O
, O
applying O
the O
same O
logic O
one O
would O
arrive O
at O
the O
conclusion O
that O
the O
stock O
market O
should O
skyrocket O
during O
a O
period O
of O
inflation O
. O

And O
I O
have O
already O
posted O
7 O
consecutive O
articles O
in O
this O
column O
concerning O
the O
reasoning O
behind O
" O
No O
bull O
markets O
with O
inflation O
" O
, O
so O
I O
wo O
n't O
linger O
further O

, O
GE O
confirmed O
it O
might O
sell O
or O
spin O
off O
its O

business O
, O
saying O
the O
business O
is O
overly O
concentrated O
in O
the O
United O

. O

With O
a O
total O
of O
13,000 O

globally O
, O
GE O

home O

department O
has O
been O
hardest O
hit O
by O
the O
stagnant O
housing O
market O
over O
the O
past O
couple O
of O
years O
, O
as O
it O
sells O
large O
quantities O
of O

and O
refrigerators O
to O
home O
builders O

MattCollins O

capital O

analyst O
at O
EdwardJones O
, O
said O
that O
with O
the O
weak O
dollar O
, O
the O
deal O
could O
be O
more O
attractive O
to O
an O
overseas O
company O
trying O
to O
get O
a O
foothold O
in O
the O
US O
market O
. O

GE O

business O
, O
which O
generated O

7.2 O

, O
is O
expected O
to O

People O
's O
use O
of O

is O
changing O
from O
being O
focused O
on O
the O
PC O
desktop O
system O
to O
being O
focused O
on O
the O
web O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
in O
the O
past O
we O
put O
everything O
into O
the O
computer O
. O

Once O
the O
computer O
is O
lost O
, O
all O
the O
information O
will O
be O
lost O
as O
well O
. O

However O
, O
in O
this O
new O
web-centric O
mode O
, O
such O
situations O
will O
no O
longer O
occur O
because O
all O
the O
services O
and O
applications O
are O
provided O
online O
-- O

No O
matter O
at O
what O
kind O
of O
terminal O
, O
people O
can O
access O
to O
all O
the O
information O
at O
any O
time O
via O
the O
Internet O
. O

This O
mechanism O
works O
just O
like O
we O
deposit O
our O
money O
in O
a O
bank O
and O
swipe O
our O
cards O
to O
make O
purchases O
instead O
of O
carrying O
cash O
with O
us O
. O

As O
described O
by O
Google O
CEO O
Schmidt O
, O
when O
computer O
networks O
form O
clusters O
, O
they O
can O
process O
huge O
data O
sets O
faster O
, O
and O
their O
speed O
to O
search O
answers O
or O
instructions O
will O
surpass O
that O
of O
any O
single O
computer O
in O
the O
world O
. O

The O
absolute O
majority O
of O
hardware O
is O
not O
installed O
in O
the O
Google O
corporate O
park O
, O
but O
is O
distributed O
all O
over O
the O
world O
. O

It O
may O
be O
running O
at O
high O
speed O
in O
a O
large O
data O
center O
near O
you O
. O

The O
attraction O
of O
this O
mode O
lies O
in O
that O
: O
the O
load O
that O
a O
national O
electricity O
grid O
can O
undertake O
can O
never O
be O
matched O
with O
that O
of O
a O
power O
generator O
. O

When O
I O
got O
up O
in O
the O
morning O
to O
listen O
to O
the O
radio O
, O
I O
was O
originally O
thinking O
of O
listening O
to O
major O
national O
affairs O
, O
such O
as O
meetings O
, O
reports O
, O
and O
activities O
attended O
by O
leaders O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
expect O
to O
hear O
the O
curses O
against O
Nanjing O
the O
moment O
I O
turned O
on O
the O
radio O
. O

In O
this O
city O
, O
traffic O
jams O
occur O
either O
in O
this O
place O
, O
or O
in O
that O
place O
. O

Either O
the O
big O
bridge O
is O
congested O
, O
or O
Beijing O
West O
Road O
is O
jammed O
. O

He O
had O
commented O
on O
all O
the O
places O
in O
Nanjing O
, O
condemning O
them O
all O
, O
without O
a O
single O
nice O
word O
. O

Our O
beautiful O
Nanjing O
, O
the O
Nanjing O
with O
good O
urban O
planning O
, O
the O
Nanjing O
with O
advanced O
transportation O
, O
the O
Nanjing O
with O
towering O
buildings O
, O
the O
Nanjing O
as O
a O
modern O
metropolis O
, O
the O
Nanjing O
we O
love O
is O
described O
overall O
as O
a O
" O
congested O
city O
. O
" O

I O
wondered O
how O
they O
knew O
it O
, O
could O
they O
be O
making O
it O
up O
? O

I O
did O
n't O
realize O
until O
later O
that O
they O
had O
installed O
remote O
cameras O
in O
multiple O
places O
to O
monitor O
numerous O
intersections O
and O
specifically O
selected O
the O
poor O
conditions O
to O
report O
on O
. O

They O
kept O
chattering O
about O
how O
were O
such O
and O
such O
roads O
, O
such O
and O
such O
vehicles O
, O
and O
sometimes O
even O
took O
the O
hard O
- O
working O
traffic O
police O
to O
task O
for O
not O
making O
enough O
effort O
to O
direct O
. O

They O
even O
revealed O
their O
police O
group O
number O
; O
that O
simply O
amounted O
to O
direct O
attacks O
. O

Collapsing O
in O
the O
great O
Wenchuan O
earthquake O
were O
not O
only O
buildings O
, O
but O
also O
a O
culture O
of O
agricultural O
civilization O
. O

Agricultural O
civilization O
, O
characterized O
by O
an O
independent O
individual O
economy O
and O
a O
centralized O
polity O
of O
dependent O
groups O
, O
is O
an O
early O
stage O
in O
human O
civilization O
. O

Transmission O
civilization O
has O
already O
begun O
, O
that O
is O
characterized O
by O
a O
closely O
cooperative O
and O
socially O
integrated O
economy O
, O
and O
a O
polity O
of O
individual O
independence O
, O
autonomy O
, O
and O
more O
choices O
-LRB- O
in O
other O
words O
, O
freedom O
-RRB- O
. O

Industrial O
civilization O
is O
just O
an O
interim O
phase O
between O
these O
two O
civilizations O
. O

The O
massive O
Wenchuan O
earthquake O
marked O
a O
complete O
end O
to O
the O
agricultural O
civilization O
. O

In O
an O
agricultural O
civilization O
, O
people O
live O
close O
to O
the O
land O
, O
and O
roads O
are O
formed O
to O
link O
their O
homes O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
a O
flood O
occurs O
, O
the O
homes O
and O
roads O
that O
have O
been O
built O
up O
over O
generations O
will O
be O
destroyed O
in O
an O
instant O
. O

The O
earthquake O
blocks O
streams O
into O
lakes O
, O
and O
tens O
of O
thousands O
of O
people O
abandon O
their O
homes O
to O
escape O
the O
disaster O
. O

In O
a O
transmission O
civilization O
, O
transport O
and O
telecommunications O
devices O
make O
life O
easier O
for O
people O
. O

People O
can O
live O
where O
they O
want O
. O

The O
unfertile O
, O
rugged O
regions O
of O
an O
agricultural O
civilization O
become O
scenic O
residences O
with O
all O
the O
conveniences O
. O

Both O
Nanjie O
villagers O
and O
cadres O
say O
there O
has O
n't O
been O
any O
restructuring O
. O

Why O
did O
the O
Nandu O
Daily O
asserted O
repeatedly O
that O
" O
there O
's O
solid O
evidence O
that O
Nanjie O
has O
restructured O
" O
and O
that O
Wang O
Hongbin O
has O
" O
privately O
turned O
the O
village O
enterprise O
into O
private O
ownership O
' O
under O
his O
only O
name O
? O
' O
" O

What O
kind O
of O
an O
iron O
whip O
have O
they O
got O
hold O
of O
as O
the O
weapon O
to O
attack O
Nanjie O
Village O
? O

Through O
our O
in O
- O
depth O
investigation O
, O
it O
turns O
out O
to O
be O
like O
this O
. O

Henan O
issued O
a O
document O
in O
2000 O
, O
requesting O
all O
enterprise O
companies O
across O
the O
province O
to O
demutualize O
. O

Industrial O
and O
commercial O
authorities O
asked O
the O
Nanjie O
Village O
Corporation O
to O
register O
its O
demutualization O
. O

The O
village O
cadres O
, O
who O
was O
adamant O
about O
public O
ownership O
-LRB- O
collective O
ownership O
-RRB- O
, O
thinking O
that O
demutualization O
was O
just O
privatization O
, O
did O
n't O
go O
through O
the O
formalities O
, O
because O
they O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
go O
back O
to O
the O
old O
road O
. O

By O
2004 O
, O
due O
to O
the O
pressure O
from O
various O
parties O
, O
with O
no O
loans O
from O
banks O
, O
a O
shortage O
of O
fluid O
funds O
and O
cash O
problems O
, O
the O
person O
in O
charge O
had O
no O
choice O
but O
to O
register O
demutualization O
in O
the O
name O
of O
a O
dozen O
some O
cadres O
in O
the O
village O
council O
. O

Wang O
Hongbin O
's O
9 O
% O
shares O
they O
recorded O
were O
more O
nominal O
than O
real O
. O

This O
is O
a O
forced O
makeshift O
in O
the O
special O
context O
of O
aligning O
with O
the O
market O
economy O
and O
the O
predominant O
trend O
of O
demutualization O
. O

Following O
the O
registration O
, O
it O
is O
announced O
in O
the O
village O
that O
the O
equities O
are O
owned O
by O
all O
villagers O
. O

The O
middle O
school O
he O
was O
at O
was O
Sangzao O
Middle O
School O
, O
Anxian O
, O
Sichuan O
. O

It O
's O
a O
junior O
middle O
school O
extremely O
well O
- O
known O
around O
Mianyang O
. O

The O
school O
had O
the O
top O
middle O
school O
entrance O
exam O
results O
in O
the O
county O
for O
13 O
years O
running O
, O
thanks O
to O
the O
high O
quality O
of O
teaching O
. O

Parents O
in O
the O
surrounding O
region O
all O
scramble O
to O
send O
their O
children O
there O
. O

The O
classes O
with O
the O
most O
students O
have O
over O
80 O
students O
. O

The O
students O
in O
the O
front O
row O
are O
sitting O
almost O
under O
the O
teacher O
's O
chin O
. O

When O
the O
earthquake O
struck O
, O
he O
was O
in O
Mianyang O
doing O
some O
official O
work O
. O

As O
the O
earth O
was O
shaking O
, O
he O
could O
n't O
keep O
upright O
, O
and O
he O
and O
the O
dean O
of O
general O
affairs O
of O
the O
school O
had O
to O
cling O
onto O
each O
other O
. O

He O
could O
n't O
get O
through O
on O
a O
cell O
phone O
, O
and O
the O
phone O
lines O
were O
cut O
. O

After O
the O
first O
wave O
of O
shocks O
had O
passed O
, O
he O
immediately O
rushed O
in O
his O
car O
to O
the O
school O
, O
which O
was O
in O
a O
badly O
- O
hit O
area O
. O

He O
drove O
the O
car O
at O
top O
speed O
, O
and O
he O
did O
n't O
say O
a O
word O
on O
the O
way O
. O

He O
thought O
about O
the O
laboratory O
building O
at O
the O
school O
that O
had O
n't O
been O
inspected O
, O
and O
worried O
most O
that O
something O
had O
happened O
to O
that O
building O
. O

In O
the O
mid O
80s O
of O
the O
last O
century O
, O
when O
that O
building O
was O
built O
, O
the O
school O
had O
n't O
used O
a O
proper O
construction O
company O
. O

It O
had O
been O
built O
in O
fits O
and O
starts O
over O
more O
than O
two O
years O
. O

Later O
, O
no O
- O
one O
dared O
inspect O
the O
building O
. O

When O
the O
new O
laboratory O
building O
was O
finished O
, O
neither O
the O
teachers O
nor O
students O
wanted O
to O
move O
into O
it O
. O

They O
all O
knew O
what O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
construction O
was O
like O
when O
no O
- O
one O
dared O
inspect O
the O
building O
. O

Although O
air O
dropping O
of O
tents O
is O
the O
top O
priority O
, O
such O
that O
the O
self O
- O
saving O
people O
in O
Wenchuan O
have O
a O
place O
to O
shelter O
from O
the O
rain O
, O
now O
it O
's O
already O
20 O
hours O
after O
the O
earthquake O
and O
images O
from O
the O
scene O
in O
Wenchuan O
have O
yet O
to O
feed O
to O
CCTV O
, O
which O
is O
quite O
a O
pity O
. O

Given O
the O
capacity O
of O
the O
satellites O
, O
feeding O
could O
be O
done O
anytime O
. O

It O
's O
the O
same O
for O
surveillance O
aircraft O
, O
which O
have O
no O
communication O
problems O
. O

There O
's O
no O
need O
to O
keep O
this O
confidential O
, O
as O
the O
entire O
nation O
are O
wondering O
exactly O
how O
miserable O
things O
are O
Wenchuan O
! O

Hiding O
information O
is O
not O
advisable O
even O
if O
the O
entire O
town O
has O
been O
buried O
alive O
! O

Now O
areas O
not O
so O
seriously O
affected O
by O
the O
quake O
, O
such O
as O
Chengdu O
, O
Mianyang O
, O
Ya'an O
and O
Dujiangyan O
, O
are O
instead O
more O
easily O
accessible O
. O

Conversely O
, O
Wenchuan O
and O
Li O
County O
, O
both O
hard O
hit O
by O
the O
disaster O
, O
where O
people O
are O
most O
jeopardized O
can O
not O
be O
accessed O
. O

Therefore O
, O
parachuting O
and O
airlifting O
rescue O
must O
be O
carried O
out O
on O
a O
large O
scale O
, O
and O
reporters O
must O
be O
placed O
there O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
, O
provided O
that O
spots O
of O
airlifting O
and O
parachuting O
are O
determined O
first O
by O
way O
of O
airborne O
surveillance O
! O

It O
's O
best O
that O
the O
seven O
military O
area O
commands O
and O
the O
Army O
Air O
Corps O
of O
the O
General O
Staff O
Headquarters O
are O
all O
dispatched O
and O
allocated O
properly O
in O
locations O
where O
rescue O
materials O
, O
medical O
personnel O
and O
engineering O
personnel O
are O
concentrated O
. O

Civil O
aviation O
and O
air O
force O
transport O
aircraft O
are O
responsible O
for O
transporting O
large O
equipment O
and O
backup O
rescue O
troops O
. O

Shuangliu O
Airport O
should O
also O
have O
a O
dedicated O
area O
for O
use O
by O
disaster O
- O
rescue O
aircrews O
. O

Rush O
repair O
of O
facilities O
like O
railways O
, O
roads O
, O
communications O
, O
power O
and O
tap O
water O
pipelines O
should O
also O
be O
done O
in O
a O
prompt O
manner O
. O

Near O
the O
Guanggu O
Square O
, O
a O
fruit O
stand O
merchant O
was O
getting O
ready O
to O
stop O
his O
vehicle O
and O
start O
selling O
. O

In O
the O
distance O
, O
a O
urban O
management O
team O
member O
slowly O
walked O
over O
, O
and O
the O
stand O
merchant O
had O
no O
alternative O
but O
to O
drive O
away O
in O
his O
vehicle O
to O
avoid O
him O
. O

He O
drove O
all O
the O
way O
around O
; O
with O
no O
urban O
management O
officer O
in O
sight O
, O
he O
stopped O
again O
, O
only O
to O
see O
the O
figure O
of O
an O
urban O
management O
officer O
loom O
again O
... O

Such O
" O
hide O
and O
seek O
" O
without O
seething O
confrontation O
often O
ended O
up O
with O
those O
sidewalk O
squatting O
merchants O
" O
pleading O
for O
leniency O
and O
fleeing O
defeated O
. O
" O

This O
method O
of O
law O
enforcement O
called O
" O
waltz O
" O
was O
gradually O
developed O
by O
Yuan O
Caishun O
along O
with O
his O
colleagues O
after O
he O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
Guanshan O
squadron O
in O
2006 O
. O

It O
has O
now O
become O
the O
marvelous O
trick O
in O
civilized O
management O
. O

Yuan O
Caishun O
has O
been O
working O
with O
the O
urban O
management O
for O
nineteen O
years O
. O

He O
knows O
that O
once O
there O
should O
be O
a O
serious O
confrontation O
with O
ordinary O
people O
, O
there O
would O
be O
enormous O
social O
impact O
, O
jeopardizing O
the O
justification O
and O
effect O
of O
law O
enforcement O
. O

He O
often O
says O
to O
his O
colleagues O
: O
Do O
n't O
be O
afraid O
of O
" O
exhausting O
your O
legs O
and O
lips O

Mr. O
Cao O
, O
who O
is O
60 O
years O
old O
this O
year O
, O
simply O
could O
n't O
withstand O
this O
" O
gentle O
offensive O
" O
of O
his O
and O
became O
the O
first O
" O
builder O
of O
illegal O
buildings O
to O
pay O
his O
own O
expenses O
of O
tearing O
down O
an O
illegal O
building O
" O
in O
the O
city O
. O

In O
2005 O
a O
safety O
accident O
took O
place O
in O
one O
of O
the O
factory O
buildings O
illegally O
constructed O
by O
Mr. O
Cao O
. O

According O
to O
the O
regulations O
, O
not O
only O
should O
the O
factory O
building O
be O
torn O
down O
, O
but O
also O
the O
wages O
must O
be O
paid O
by O
the O
owner O
. O

Mr. O
Cao O
was O
adamantly O
unwilling O
. O

Untiringly O
, O
Yuan O
Caishun O
repeatedly O
visited O
him O
at O
home O
to O
persuade O
him O
. O

This O
went O
on O
for O
half O
a O
month O
till O
Mr. O
Cao O
finally O
nodded O
and O
took O
out O
4,000 O
yuan O
in O
cash O
to O
" O
foot O
the O
bill O
" O
for O
tearing O
down O
the O
factory O
building O
he O
himself O
constructed O
at O
the O
cost O
of O
hundreds O
of O
thousands O
yuan O
. O

This O
is O
the O
" O
broken O
window O
theory O
" O
of O
economics O
, O
also O
known O
as O
the O
" O
broken O
window O
fallacy O
" O
. O

This O
theory O
states O
that O
when O
a O
kid O
breaks O
a O
window O
, O
this O
necessarily O
leads O
to O
the O
person O
whose O
window O
it O
is O
replacing O
the O
window O
pane O
. O

This O
puts O
the O
person O
who O
fits O
windows O
and O
the O
person O
who O
manufactures O
glass O
in O
work O
, O
and O
consequently O
creates O
employment O
opportunities O
and O
community O
prosperity O
. O

And O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
" O
multiplier O
theory O
" O
-- O
the O
window O
industry O
person O
earns O
some O
money O
, O
goes O
to O
buy O
a O
cola O
and O
brings O
the O
cola O
manufacturer O
an O
opportunity O
for O
business O
. O

The O
cola O
dealer O
might O
then O
go O
to O
buy O
shoes O
. O

Following O
this O
reasoning O
through O
, O
the O
wealth O
brought O
by O
the O
kid O
breaking O
a O
window O
will O
outweigh O
by O
far O
the O
losses O
involved O
. O

Keynes O
in O
' O
The O
General O
Theory O
of O
Employment O
, O
Interest O
and O
Money O
' O
writes O
" O
If O
the O
Treasury O
stuffed O
all O
the O

they O

full O
with O

, O
put O
these O

down O

" O

He O
went O
on O
to O
even O
suggest O
: O
" O
If O
our O

can O
not O
think O
of O

then O
pyramid O

all O
serve O

" O

If O
Nanjie O

had O
really O
issued O

, O
and O
then O
it O
would O
have O
been O
paying O
dividends O
on O

from O

But O

is O
: O
none O

The O

nice O
as O

that O
the O

live O

Finally O
, O
one O
point O
that O
must O
be O
stressed O
is O
that O
the O
disaster O
rescue O
this O
time O
must O
mainly O
rely O
on O
mechanized O
rescue O
, O
which O
should O
be O
used O
especially O
for O
removing O
obstacles O
and O
clearing O
the O
road O
leading O
to O
Wenchuan O
. O

Repeating O
again O
the O
rescue O
operation O
mode O
for O
the O
great O
Tangshan O
earthquake O
, O
which O
relied O
purely O
on O
manpower O
, O
will O
not O
yield O
good O
results O
. O

Rescue O
dogs O
, O
detectors O
, O
and O
other O
professional O
tools O
also O
need O
to O
be O
urgently O
dispatched O
and O
shipped O
. O

Rescue O
experts O
from O
the O
United O
States O
and O
Japan O
must O
also O
be O
invited O
for O
joint O
consultation O
as O
quickly O
as O
possible O
. O

My O
hometown O
is O
in O
Sichuan O
, O
and O
my O
parents O
are O
still O
there O
. O

Yesterday O
I O
made O
a O
phone O
call O
and O
learned O
they O
were O
safe O
, O
so O
I O
am O
a O
bit O
relieved O
. O

But O
they O
said O
the O
quake O
this O
time O
was O
more O
serious O
than O
all O
the O
earthquakes O
before O
. O

Nobody O
dared O
to O
keep O
staying O
indoors O
; O
they O
were O
just O
scared O
of O
aftershocks O
. O

This O
morning O
I O
called O
again O
. O

Mom O
said O
there O
was O
another O
aftershock O
at O
4:00 O
a.m. O
, O
and O
all O
the O
windows O
rattled O
. O

Communications O
with O
Wenchuan O
and O
Lixian O
remain O
disconnected O
as O
of O
today O
, O
so O
no O
details O
of O
damages O
are O
known O
. O

The O
surrounding O
areas O
such O
as O
Beichuan O
, O
Dujiangyan O
, O
and O
Hanyuan O
were O
severely O
hit O
by O
the O
earthquake O
disaster O
, O
with O
death O
toll O
already O
exceeding O
8,000 O
. O

Adding O
that O
of O
Wenchuan O
and O
Lixian O
, O
I O
estimate O
it O
will O
be O
between O
50,000 O
and O
100,000 O
, O
far O
surpassing O
that O
of O
the O
typhoon O
disaster O
in O
Myanmar O
. O

The O
economic O
losses O
will O
surpass O
that O
of O
the O
nation O
- O
wide O
blizzard O
disaster O
at O
more O
than O
100 O
billion O
at O
least O
. O

I O
thought O
of O
every O
way O
possible O
to O
borrow O
money O
, O
and O
due O
to O
the O
help O
of O
a O
lot O
of O
friends O
and O
relatives O
, O
I O
finally O
bought O
the O
house O
. O

There O
were O
many O
stories O
in O
the O
process O
that O
I O
always O
remember O
with O
gratitude O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
lay O
them O
out O
in O
great O
detail O
. O

Just O
keeping O
them O
in O
my O
mind O
and O
being O
grateful O
for O
a O
lifetime O
will O
do O
. O

After O
the O
house O
was O
bought O
it O
stood O
there O
for O
some O
months O
, O
and O
in O
the O
spring O
equinox O
of O
2007 O
we O
started O
fitting O
it O
out O
. O

That O
really O
was O
a O
time O
full O
of O
hard O
work O
and O
happiness O
. O

Each O
time O
we O
would O
ride O
our O
electric O
bike O
from O
the O
countryside O
dozens O
of O
kilometers O
into O
the O
city O
, O
buying O
some O
things O
and O
then O
wearily O
taking O
the O
long O
road O
back O
again O
. O

We O
rode O
under O
the O
burning O
sun O
, O
through O
wind O
and O
rain O
, O
heard O
the O
sound O
of O
croaking O
frogs O
by O
the O
roadside O
, O
and O
counted O
the O
bright O
stars O
above O
us O
. O

On O
August O
10 O
it O
was O
all O
over O
at O
last O
, O
and O
we O
moved O
into O
the O
house O
that O
belonged O
to O
us O
. O

This O
process O
was O
mostly O
to O
the O
credit O
of O
my O
wife O
. O

If O
it O
was O
n't O
for O
her O
decisiveness O
, O
this O
house O
may O
well O
not O
have O
belonged O
to O
us O
. O

And O
now O
that O
house O
prices O
have O
risen O
a O
lot O
again O
, O
if O
it O
was O
now O
we O
would O
have O
even O
less O
of O
a O
chance O
of O
buying O
. O

While O
during O
the O
whole O
decoration O
process O
, O
with O
her O
sitting O
on O
the O
back O
of O
my O
electric O
bike O
, O
even O
if O
her O
legs O
were O
numb O
, O
even O
if O
the O
wind O
blew O
and O
she O
was O
soaked O
by O
rain O
, O
she O
never O
had O
a O
single O
complaint O
. O

And O
once O
we O
got O
back O
to O
the O
school O
, O
she O
still O
had O
to O
cook O
, O
wash O
clothes O
, O
tidy O
up O
that O
dorm O
room O
where O
we O
lived O
, O
that O
home O
. O

And O
I O
would O
be O
sitting O
in O
front O
of O
the O
computer O
well O
before O
, O
writing O
all O
those O
useless O
articles O
, O
one O
after O
the O
other O
. O

They O
also O
pay O
out O
salary O
specially O
providing O
for O
a O
large O
gang O
of O
female O
duty O
officers O
, O
who O
watch O
the O
screens O
all O
day O
monitoring O
intersections O
, O
and O
not O
a O
few O
minutes O
go O
by O
without O
a O
negative O
report O
. O

That O
female O
voice O
is O
pure O
misery O
. O

I O
am O
No. O
xx O
duty O
officer O
, O
according O
to O
the O
screen O
at O
the O
moment O
, O
such O
and O
such O
an O
intersection O
is O
badly O

Actually O
I O
know O
on O
such O
a O
holiday O
, O
children O
should O
have O
sent O
some O
delicacies O
to O
their O
parents O
. O

In O
the O
past O
, O
when O
my O
paternal O
grandfather O
and O
grandmother O
were O
alive O
, O
my O
aunts O
would O
ask O
others O
to O
send O
something O
up O
here O
, O
and O
the O
elderly O
would O
usually O
feel O
the O
pride O
and O
happiness O
of O
being O
a O
parent O
at O
such O
a O
time O
. O

Now O
I O
've O
got O
my O
own O
small O
family O
, O
but O
I O
've O
never O
thought O
about O
my O
parents O
at O
home O
. O

Every O
time O
I O
think O
of O
them O
, O
it O
's O
often O
a O
time O
when O
we O
are O
short O
of O
food O
at O
our O
own O
home O
. O

I O
should O
be O
the O
one O
who O
feels O
guilty O
and O
upset O
, O
but O
it O
seems O
I O
've O
never O
felt O
this O
way O
. O

During O
the O
telephone O
call O
, O
mother O
also O
told O
me O
that O
my O
maternal O
grandmother O
was O
at O
her O
place O
. O

In O
previous O
years O
, O
mother O
would O
prepare O
something O
and O
ask O
father O
to O
send O
to O
my O
maternal O
grandmother O
's O
place O
. O

My O
maternal O
grandmother O
lives O
about O
five O
li O
from O
us O
, O
but O
it O
's O
a O
mountain O
path O
that O
winds O
around O
the O
mountains O
, O
an O
extremely O
hard O
walk O
. O

Yet O
every O
time O
grandma O
actually O
comes O
on O
her O
own O
. O

You O
should O
know O
grandma O
is O
already O
an O
old O
person O
of O
over O
80 O
. O

I O
was O
a O
bit O
unhappy O
with O
my O
mother O
, O
" O
why O
do O
n't O
go O
and O
get O
her O
. O
" O

Mother O
said O
, O
" O
grandma O
is O
like O
a O
kid O
. O

How O
can O
I O
get O
her O
when O
I O
have O
no O
idea O
when O
she O
wants O
to O
come O

Mr. O
Bo O
Yang O
, O
a O
famous O
scholar O
in O
Taiwan O
, O
passed O
away O
this O
morning O
at O
the O
age O
of O
89 O
. O

His O
tumultuous O
yet O
legendary O
life O
came O
to O
an O
end O
. O

From O
now O
on O
, O
the O
Chinese O
literati O
will O
again O
have O
one O
fewer O
sage O
and O
warrior O
. O

It O
was O
, O
of O
course O
, O
because O
of O
that O
book O
" O
The O
Ugly O
Chinaman O
" O
that O
I O
first O
learned O
about O
Bo O
Yang O
. O

In O
the O
mid O
and O
late O
80s O
of O
the O
last O
century O
, O
I O
was O
in O
middle O
school O
. O

For O
some O
time O
, O
this O
book O
was O
suddenly O
in O
hot O
circulation O
in O
our O
class O
. O

I O
found O
a O
copy O
very O
quickly O
and O
read O
it O
with O
great O
eagerness O
. O

I O
was O
immediately O
attracted O
by O
Bo O
Yang O
's O
vivid O
and O
pungent O
style O
, O
and O
sharp O
and O
unique O
opinion O
. O

What O
impressed O
me O
most O
was O
the O
concept O
of O
" O
soy O
- O
vat O
culture O
" O
proposed O
in O
the O
book O
. O

A O
remark O
that O
made O
people O
most O
angry O
was O
" O
one O
Chinaman O
is O
a O
dragon O
; O
three O
Chinamen O
are O
a O
worm O
. O

One O
Japanese O
is O
a O
worm O
, O
while O
three O
Japanese O
people O
are O
a O
dragon O
. O
" O

I O
remember O
that O
at O
that O
time O
I O
even O
had O
a O
debate O
with O
my O
classmates O
over O
this O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
prove O
that O
" O
three O
Chinamen O
are O
not O
a O
worm O
. O
" O

It O
ended O
up O
in O
nothing O
conclusive O
. O

It O
was O
not O
until O
later O
when O
I O
grew O
older O
and O
gained O
more O
life O
experience O
did O
I O
gradually O
come O
to O
understand O
and O
accept O
this O
statement O
. O

I O
knew O
it O
may O
not O
be O
unbiased O
, O
yet O
it O
indeed O
hit O
the O
nail O
on O
the O
head O
by O
pointing O
out O
a O
major O
weakness O
in O
the O
character O
of O
Chinese O
people O
. O

High O
oil O
prices O
have O
destroyed O
the O
original O
operation O
mode O
of O
the O
U.S. O
economy O
. O

As O
other O
sectors O
of O
the O
U.S. O
economy O
failed O
to O
cope O
with O
high O
oil O
prices O
by O
raising O
labor O
productivity O
, O
their O
investment O
returns O
dropped O
and O
capital O
expenditures O
declined O
. O

Under O
the O
interaction O
of O
these O
two O
factors O
, O
housing O
prices O
plummeted O
and O
the O
subprime O
mortgage O
crisis O
exploded O
. O

I O
am O
probably O
the O
first O
person O
in O
the O
country O
who O
proposed O
that O
the O
rise O
in O
oil O
prices O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
supply O
and O
demand O
nor O
did O
it O
have O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
the O
Middle O
East O
situations O
. O

In O
early O
2004 O
I O
already O
said O
in O
an O
interview O
with O
a O
weekly O
magazine O
: O
The O
hidden O
manipulator O
behind O
oils O
is O
the O
hedge O
fund O
. O

Why O
was O
n't O
Europe O
impacted O
by O
high O
oil O
prices O
? O

The O
European O
Union O
has O
been O
carrying O
out O
its O
obligation O
to O
reduce O
carbon O
dioxide O
emission O
voluntarily O
for O
nearly O
ten O
years O
. O

This O
has O
led O
to O
a O
constant O
adjustment O
of O
the O
economic O
activities O
in O
this O
region O
with O
a O
focus O
on O
emission O
reduction O
and O
energy O
conservation O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
the O
economy O
of O
the O
European O
Union O
, O
restrained O
by O
the O
Kyoto O
Protocol O
, O
adjusted O
itself O
in O
advance O
to O
the O
challenge O
of O
high O
oil O
prices O
, O
and O
the O
overall O
economy O
has O
maintained O
a O
healthy O
operation O
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
euro O
can O
continue O
to O
rise O
during O
the O
period O
of O
rising O
oil O
prices O
. O

Just O
as O
a O
person O
's O
name O
says O
something O
about O
the O
person O
, O
Chen O
's O
" O
first O
pot O
of O
gold O
" O
came O
from O
the O
lumber O
business O
indicated O
in O
his O
name O
. O

In O
1982 O
, O
Chen O
got O
a O
ticket O
for O
a O
=train O
bound O
for O
Xiamen O
in O
exchange O
of O
his O
free O
labor O
. O

This O
was O
the O
first O
time O
that O
he O
saw O
the O
world O
beyond O
the O
countryside O
. O

It O
was O
also O
this O
experience O
that O
gave O
him O
the O
inspiration O
for O
making O
money O
. O

He O
secured O
two O
truckloads O
of O
lumber O
on O
his O
own O
pretty O
good O
credit O
with O
the O
forest O
farm O
in O
the O
countryside O
and O
shipped O
them O
to O
Xiamen O
, O
making O
over O
1,000 O
yuan O
. O

From O
shipping O
by O
trucks O
to O
shipping O
by O
train O
, O
Chen O
made O
himself O
into O
the O
largest O
lumber O
supplier O
in O
Quanzhou O
by O
1986 O
. O

That O
year O
, O
he O
owned O
his O
first O
house O
in O
Xiamen O
. O

However O
, O
unwilling O
to O
stay O
put O
, O
Chen O
Fashu O
mortgaged O
his O
house O
a O
year O
later O
and O
used O
it O
as O
collateral O
to O
purchase O
a O
motor O
tricycle O
. O

Together O
with O
his O
two O
younger O
brothers O
, O
he O
hauled O
goods O
for O
a O
small O
store O
and O
bought O
the O
storefront O
soon O
afterwards O
. O

Since O
then O
, O
Chen O
has O
been O
irrevocably O
committed O
to O
the O
business O
of O
department O
stores O
. O

It O
was O
also O
from O
this O
small O
store O
of O
less O
than O
10 O
square O
meters O
that O
the O
future O
powerful O
Xinhuadu O
Department O
Store O
took O
shape O
. O

An O
old O
Chinese O
saying O
goes O
" O
being O
in O
a O
different O
trade O
is O
like O
being O
in O
another O
world O
. O
" O

So O
if O
virtually O
unrelated O
trades O
, O
such O
as O
trading O
timbers O
, O
selling O
miscellaneous O
goods O
, O
running O
a O
gold O
mine O
, O
project O
contracting O
, O
operating O
tour O
groups O
, O
and O
developing O
real O
estates O
, O
are O
put O
together O
, O
can O
you O
believe O
one O
person O
can O
do O
everything O
successfully O
? O

This O
may O
be O
an O
advantage O
of O
southern O
business O
people O
?? O

Smooth O
and O
slick O
in O
all O
aspects O
. O

At O
present O
, O
chain O
management O
, O
which O
has O
become O
the O
most O
important O
organizational O
form O
of O
domestic O
and O
foreign O
retail O
businesses O
, O
has O
a O
crucial O
role O
in O
circulation O
. O

The O
largest O
retailer O
globally O
Wal O
- O
Mart O
has O
opened O
its O
10,000 O
plus O
stores O
almost O
everywhere O
in O
the O
world O
. O

KFC O
and O
McDonald O
's O
are O
the O
same O
, O
in O
that O
their O
chains O
are O
world O
- O
class O
. O

A O
company O
managed O
as O
a O
chain O
, O
due O
to O
its O
fairly O
clear O

advantage O
and O
a O

improves O
its O

Thus O
, O
some O

have O
shouted O

Yesterday O
I O
called O
home O
again O
. O

Mom O
said O
grandma O
had O
already O
gone O
back O
home O
. O

I O
asked O
if O
she O
walked O
back O
alone O
again O
. O

Mom O
said O
how O
could O
that O
be O
, O
of O
course O
she O
accompanied O
her O
home O
. O

I O
was O
always O
curious O
what O
they O
, O
the O
mother O
and O
daughter O
, O
would O
talk O
about O
on O
the O
way O
back O
. O

Could O
it O
be O
grandma O
talking O
about O
the O
happiness O
of O
having O
a O
full O
house O
of O
grandchildren O
or O
grandma O
feeling O
proud O
reminiscing O
her O
entire O
life O
of O
bringing O
up O
seven O
sons O
and O
daughters O
. O

So O
mom O
must O
be O
listening O
quietly O
. O

At O
this O
moment O
she O
was O
a O
daughter O
just O
like O
I O
am O
her O
son O
at O
this O
moment O
, O
also O
eager O
to O
listen O
quietly O
to O
her O
telling O
about O
the O
hardship O
in O
the O
past O
and O
the O
happiness O
in O
the O
future O
. O

Mom O
said O
on O
the O
phone O
that O
she O
slipped O
by O
accident O
the O
day O
before O
yesterday O
and O
got O
a O
swollen O
bump O
like O
an O
egg O
on O
the O
head O
. O

I O
was O
extremely O
worried O
and O
asked O
if O
mom O
felt O
any O
better O
, O
whether O
her O
head O
hurt O
, O
and O
whether O
she O
felt O
dizzy O
. O

Mom O
said O
no O
, O
it O
was O
just O
a O
bit O
swollen O
still O
, O
nothing O
the O
matter O
. O

All O
of O
a O
sudden O

I O
suddenly O

This O
mom O
, O
who O
used O
to O
sound O
grumpy O
on O
the O
phone O
, O
has O
grown O
old O
. O

Like O
a O
child O
, O
she O
listened O
to O
my O
advice O
and O
kept O
promising O
to O
be O
more O
careful O
. O

Older O
people O
getting O
remarried O
is O
a O
need O
in O
life O
, O
as O

as O

Marriage O
experts O
believe O
older O
people O
getting O
remarried O
on O
one O
hand O
can O
reduce O
the O
burden O
on O
children O
of O
both O
sides O
. O

With O
two O
people O
supporting O
and O
caring O
for O
each O
other O
, O
children O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
get O
overly O
distracted O
and O
anxious O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
by O
getting O
remarried O
, O
older O
people O
will O
have O
somebody O
to O
depend O
on O
at O
an O
older O
age O
. O

They O
can O
support O
each O
other O
economically O
, O
care O
for O
each O
other O
in O
life O
, O
have O
somebody O
who O
respond O
to O
and O
understand O
their O
words O
, O
and O
comfort O
each O
other O
mentally O
, O
which O
is O
good O
for O
the O
wellbeing O
of O
older O
people O
. O

In O
recent O
years O
, O
the O
phenomenon O
of O
older O
people O
getting O
married O
has O
gradually O
increased O
. O

Most O
young O
people O
are O
in O
favor O
of O
their O
parents O
getting O
remarried O
, O
and O
are O
even O
active O
in O
being O
the O
matchmaker O
or O
go O
- O
between O
for O
the O
remarriage O
of O
their O
parents O
, O
which O
is O
a O
manifestation O
of O
social O
civilization O
. O

Some O
young O
people O
oppose O
their O
old O
people O
getting O
remarried O
, O
while O
others O
are O
concerned O
that O
there O
may O
be O
inheritance O
disputes O
after O
their O
parents O
pass O
away O
. O

When O
the O
earth O
is O
still O
unrest O
in O
the O
aftermath O
of O
the O
Great O
Wenchuan O
Earthquake O
that O
rocked O
China O
and O
shocked O
the O
world O
, O
the O
premier O
of O
the O
Chinese O
government O
has O
personally O
travelled O
to O
disaster O
- O
hit O
areas O
to O
organize O
disaster O

rescue O
efforts O
, O
winning O
applause O
from O
Chinese O
worldwide O
and O

respecting O

With O
the O
joint O
effort O
of O
people O
around O
the O
world O
, O
countless O
lives O
have O
been O
promptly O
saved O
and O
homeless O

have O
been O
initially O
placed O
. O

People O
are O
faced O
with O
a O
further O
challenge O
of O
how O
to O
rebuild O
the O
homeland O
for O
several O
million O
people O
hit O
by O
the O
disaster O
. O

After O
days O
of O
hard O
thinking O
, O
from O
countless O
cruel O
realities O
that O
we O
can O
not O
shun O
away O
from O
, O
we O
've O
finally O
found O
a O
tiny O
path O
of O
hope O
. O

Going O
forward O
along O
the O
thorny O
path O
, O
we O
suddenly O
see O
the O
daylight O
and O
a O
bright O
and O
broad O
road O
leading O
to O
the O
future O
. O
That O
is O
moving O
the O
capital O
to O
Chengdu O
to O
rebuild O
western O
Sichuan O
. O

Moving O
the O
capital O
to O
Chengdu O
will O
help O
millions O
of O
people O
in O
the O
disaster O
- O
hit O
areas O
rebuild O
their O
homeland O
at O
an O
early O
time O
. O

Rebuilding O
the O
homeland O
for O
millions O
of O
disaster O
victims O
, O
which O
has O
never O
happened O
and O
never O
to O
happen O
again O
, O
requires O
a O
powerful O
government O
to O
" O
step O
forward O
when O
giving O
directions O
" O
and O
organize O
and O
supervise O
rebuilding O
of O
western O
Sichuan O
by O
itself O
. O

Moving O
the O
capital O
to O
Chengdu O
will O
help O
stabilize O
the O
emotions O
of O
people O
in O
disaster O
- O
hit O
areas O
. O

The O
central O
government O
being O
able O
to O
share O
their O
weal O
and O
woe O
is O
the O
best O
emotional O
support O
and O
mental O
solace O
for O
people O
in O
the O
earthquake O
- O
hit O
area O
of O
Wenchuan O
. O

Moving O
the O
capital O
to O
Chengdu O
will O
help O
provide O
strong O
scientific O
and O
political O
support O
to O
rebuilding O
the O

Various O
news O
sources O
including O
people.com.cn O
all O
reported O
that O
our O
neighbor O
, O
Nepal O
, O
is O
currently O
holding O
an O
election O
. O

So O
, O
the O
election O
already O
seems O
to O
be O
somewhat O
taking O
a O
direction O
, O
with O
the O
Communist O
Party O
of O
Nepal O
-LRB- O
Maoist O
-RRB- O
currently O
in O
the O
lead O
. O

I O
read O
a O
piece O
of O
news O
that O
said O
one O
of O
the O
leaders O
of O
the O
Communist O
Party O
of O
Nepal O
-LRB- O
Maoist O
-RRB- O
, O
Mr. O
Baburam O
, O
got O
far O
more O
votes O
than O
the O
others O
did O
. O

I O
saw O
from O
this O
piece O
of O
news O
that O
there O
are O
mainly O
three O
powerful O
parties O
in O
this O
election O
in O
Nepal O
. O

One O
is O
the O
Communist O
Party O
of O
Nepal O
-LRB- O
Maoist O
-RRB- O
which O
we O
just O
mentioned O
above O
is O
currently O
taking O
the O
lead O
in O
the O
election O
, O
one O
is O
the O
Nepali O
Congress O
Party O
, O
and O
still O
another O
is O
the O
Communist O
Party O
of O
Nepal O
-LRB- O
United O
Marxist O
- O
Leninist O
-RRB- O
. O

At O
first O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
understand O
why O
these O
two O
Communist O
organizations O
in O
Nepal O
did O
n't O
unite O
to O
take O
part O
in O
the O
election O
together O
. O

If O
they O
're O
each O
after O
their O
own O
goals O
, O
would O
n't O
their O
strength O
be O
split O
up O
? O

Only O
when O
I O
read O
an O
explanation O
from O
Mr. O
Baburam O
later O
did O
I O
realize O
the O
reason O
why O
they O
did O
n't O
unite O
to O
take O
part O
in O
the O
election O
together O
. O

I O
was O
startled O
to O
hear O
about O
the O
Sichuan O
earthquake O
, O
where O
nearly O
ten O
thousand O
people O
have O
already O
died O
, O
and O
I O
could O
n't O
help O
feeling O
panicked O
. O

Though O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
any O
relatives O
there O
, O
we O
all O
are O
Chinese O
, O
compatriots O
in O
China O
, O
and O
at O
this O
moment O
of O
calamity O
, O
we O
can O
not O
refrain O
from O
extending O
a O
helping O
hand O
, O
we O
must O
do O
all O
we O
can O
to O
console O
our O
countrymen O
who O
have O
died O
tragically O
as O
well O
as O
our O
own O
consciences O
. O

At O
the O
dinner O
table O
, O
our O
whole O
family O
, O
including O
my O
13 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
daughter O
and O
nearly O
4 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
son O
, O
unanimously O
agreed O
that O
we O
would O
make O
a O
donation O
for O
the O
disaster O
- O
stricken O
people O
. O

My O
daughter O
decided O
to O
contribute O
a O
portion O
from O
the O
money O
she O
earns O
from O
her O
mom O
and O
dad O
by O
doing O
chores O
around O
the O
house O
. O

Saving O
the O
country O
from O
disaster O
is O
the O
duty O
of O
us O
overseas O
Chinese O
, O
and O
it O
is O
also O
the O
fine O
tradition O
of O
us O
overseas O
Chinese O
. O

When O
the O
1911 O
Revolution O
broke O
out O
back O
then O
, O
overseas O
Chinese O
made O
donations O
of O
money O
and O
supplies O
, O
even O
directly O
participating O
in O
the O
revolution O
, O
shedding O
their O
blood O
in O
sacrifice O
and O
making O
a O
huge O
contribution O
for O
the O
revolutionary O
cause O
in O
the O
period O
of O
modern O
China O
. O

When O
the O
Japanese O
aggressors O
invaded O
our O
rivers O
and O
mountains O
, O
Tan O
Kah O
Kee O
rose O
and O
issued O
a O
call O
. O

Overseas O
Chinese O
in O
Southeast O
Asia O
almost O
emptied O
their O
wallets O
to O
donate O
up O
to O
more O
than O
20 O
million O
yuan O
, O
and O
along O
with O
the O
remittances O
overseas O
Chinese O
sent O
to O
their O
relatives O
in O
China O
, O
the O
total O
was O
as O
huge O
as O
several O
hundred O
million O

constituting O
the O
most O
important O
source O
of O
foreign O

for O
the O

at O
that O
time O
. O

Even O
in O
the O
early O

following O
the O

and O
opening O

up O
, O
the O
policy O
of O
the O
Chinese O
government O
of O
inviting O
foreign O

actually O
did O
not O
attract O
much O
investment O
from O

The O

Accepting O
donations O
should O
have O
an O
extent O
. O

We O
ca O
n't O
accept O
or O
not O
refuse O
to O
take O
donations O
from O
everyone O
and O
then O
trumpet O
on O
about O
love O
and O
compassion O
, O
while O
giving O
no O
thought O
to O
whether O
doing O
this O
is O
or O
is O
not O
lacking O
in O
humanity O
. O

Exactly O
- O
these O
poor O
people O
donations O
really O
are O
worth O
calling O
attention O
to O
, O
but O
for O
humane O
sake O
, O
can O
we O
accept O
their O
donations O
? O

We O
ca O
n't O
be O
on O
the O
one O
hand O
treating O
the O
rich O
, O
treating O
the O
capitalists O
generously O
and O
being O
exceptionally O
miserly O
with O
the O
poor O
, O
while O
at O
the O
same O
time O
not O
=passing O
up O
even O
the O
rent O
money O
from O
these O
kind O
of O
poor O
old O
guys O
. O

Exactly O
- O
elderly O
people O
donating O
is O
their O
voluntary O
will O
, O
an O
expression O
of O
the O
elderly O
's O
compassion O
. O

But O
, O
what O
about O
the O
love O
of O
this O
nation O
's O
community O
for O
the O
elderly O
- O
does O
it O
really O
love O
old O
people O
? O

Accepting O
this O
sort O
of O
donation O
from O
the O
poverty O
- O
stricken O
poor O
, O
on O
the O
surface O
appears O
as O
if O
out O
of O
humanity O
. O

Even O
though O
the O
poor O
may O
be O
clothed O
in O
rags O
, O
they O
quite O
clearly O
stand O
on O
the O
moral O
high O
ground O
. O

However O
, O
whether O
we O
look O
at O
it O
from O
its O
pattern O
or O
from O
its O
implications O
, O
accepting O
such O
donations O
from O
the O
poor O
is O
precisely O
what O
causes O
us O
to O
lose O
the O
most O
basic O
humanity O
. O

If O
our O
country O
has O
set O
up O
a O
welfare O
system O
guaranteeing O
the O
peoples O
' O
maternity O
, O
retirement O
, O
health O
and O
funeral O
expenses O
, O
guaranteeing O
the O
basic O
necessities O
of O
life O
, O
nobody O
could O
possibly O
have O
objections O
to O
accepting O
these O
donations O
from O
the O
poor O
. O

But O
have O
we O
done O
this O
? O

In O
Chengdu O
, O
which O
is O
over O
100 O
kms O
away O
from O
the O
epicenter O
, O
the O
earthquake O
should O
not O
have O
an O
intensity O
of O
over O
7 O
, O
or O
8 O
at O
the O
most O
. O

There O
should O
not O
be O
any O
safety O
problems O
for O
Class O
A O
buildings O
like O
those O
at O
the O
airport O
, O
hospitals O
and O
schools O
that O
are O
designed O
to O
withstand O
a O
intensity O
of O
8 O
. O

So O
most O
buildings O
in O
Chengdu O
should O
still O
be O
able O
to O
use O
after O
emergency O
assessment O
, O
and O
citizens O
may O
go O
home O
reassured O
. O

If O
not O
so O
, O
an O
investigation O
should O
be O
conducted O
for O
any O
jerry O
- O
built O
projects O
. O

If O
large O
sums O
of O
money O
have O
been O
spent O
to O
provide O
protection O
, O
yet O
it O
fails O
to O
work O
when O
the O
earthquake O
comes O
, O
such O
that O
nobody O
dares O
to O
live O
at O
home O
, O
is O
able O
to O
use O
hospitals O
, O
or O
accesses O
airports O
, O
then O
has O
the O
money O
been O
thrown O
for O
nothing O
? O

Probably O
some O
would O
say O
the O
national O
building O
criteria O
for O
earthquake O
resistance O
was O
enacted O
in O
recent O
years O
, O
and O
older O
buildings O
may O
not O
comply O
with O
the O
requirements O
. O

However O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
the O
government O
enacted O
the O
earthquake O
resistance O
criteria O
, O
it O
required O
all O
existing O
buildings O
which O
did O
not O
satisfy O
the O
criteria O
to O
be O
reinforced O
and O
removed O
of O
dangers O
in O
a O
timely O
fashion O
. O

Thus O
one O
can O
not O
shirk O
responsibilities O
on O
excuse O
that O
it O
is O
an O
old O
building O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
government O
also O
has O
criteria O
for O
earthquake O
resistance O
and O
prevention O
for O
rural O
buildings O
. O

It O
is O
a O
pity O
that O
in O
this O
unprecedented O
and O
enthusiastic O
surge O
of O
donation O
some O
phenomena O
occurred O
that O
run O
counter O
to O
the O
original O
meaning O
of O
donation O
. O

If O
we O
do O
not O
ponder O
and O
reexamine O
this O
promptly O
, O
it O
will O
affect O
the O
formation O
of O
a O
sustainable O
and O
mature O
donation O
culture O
in O
Chinese O
society O
. O

Being O
voluntary O
and O
asking O
for O
no O
return O
are O
the O
two O
major O
principles O
of O
making O
donations O
. O

Lack O
of O
either O
of O
the O
two O
would O
make O
donations O
taxes O
or O
transactions O
of O
sale O
and O
purchase O
. O

It O
is O
voluntary O
because O
the O
donor O
is O
following O
his O
inner O
call O
of O
morality O
, O
rather O
than O
an O
external O
legal O
obligation O
or O
the O
fear O
of O
sanctions O
. O

When O
no O
return O
is O
sought O
, O
making O
donations O
can O
then O
assume O
no O
nature O
of O
exchange O
of O
interests O
on O
the O
one O
hand O
, O

and O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
more O
importantly O
, O
it O
also O
distinguishes O
donations O
from O
handouts O
. O

It O
wo O
n't O
make O
the O
beneficiary O
feel O
a O
sense O
of O
inequality O
due O
to O
his O
dependency O
and O
need O
to O
feel O
grateful O
. O

Therefore O
, O
if O
donations O
are O
not O
anonymous O
, O
at O
least O
efforts O
should O
be O
made O
to O
prevent O
the O
formation O
of O
direct O
one O
- O
to O
- O
one O
relationship O
between O
the O
donor O
and O
the O
beneficiary O
. O

These O
things O
called O
blogs O
are O
no O
longer O
new O
things O
, O
and O
even O
many O
elementary O
school O
students O
now O
have O
more O
than O
one O
blog O
. O

How O
do O
BSPs O
compete O
? O

The O
technologies O
are O
nearly O
all O
mutually O
known O
, O
and O
there O
are O
just O
those O
few O
functions O
. O

In O
circumstances O
where O
the O
functions O
are O
identical O
and O
the O
technologies O
are O
similar O
, O
to O
win O
or O
lose O
all O
depends O
on O
the O
details O
, O
and O
you O
could O
even O
say O
it O
simply O
depends O
on O
the O
feel O
, O
which O
is O
very O
subtle O
. O

As O
long O
as O
it O
looks O
good O
, O
it O
should O
be O
fine O
. O

Ordinary O
web O
users O
are O
not O
as O
sophisticated O
as O
we O
are O
. O

They O
simply O
need O
a O
space O
that O
looks O
good O
. O

If O
you O
are O
slightly O
better O
than O
the O
others O
, O
you O
can O
win O
back O
the O
whole O
world O
. O

But O
then O
again O
, O
even O
with O
a O
blog O
as O
simple O
as O
mine O
here O
, O
while O
I O
am O
using O
it O
I O
can O
still O
think O
of O
so O
many O
areas O
that O
need O
improvement O
. O

So O
, O
a O
BSP O
with O
so O
many O
users O
must O
have O
some O
areas O
that O
need O
improvement O
. O

If O
a O
product O
turns O
into O
one O
that O
stops O
thinking O
of O
how O
to O
innovate O
, O
then O
it O
will O
sooner O
or O
later O
be O
discarded O
by O
the O
users O
. O

A O
thing O
I O
have O
recently O
been O
using O
most O
is O
QQSpace O
, O
and O
I O
did O
n't O
even O
considered O
it O
a O
BSP O
. O

There O
are O
still O
many O
problems O
with O
QQSpace O
, O
but O
you O
can O
also O
see O
many O
subtle O
improvements O
in O
the O
details O
, O
all O
to O
the O
greater O
satisfaction O
of O
the O
users O
. O

Following O
the O
Great O
Wenchuan O
Earthquake O
this O
time O
, O
there O
were O
compatriots O
who O
struggled O
out O
of O
the O
debris O
, O
wiped O
their O
tears O
and O
buried O
the O
bodies O
of O
their O
families O
, O
but O
they O
braced O
up O
again O
and O
declared O
to O
the O
world O
, O
" O
we O
are O
not O
beaten O
down O
; O
we O
are O
on O
our O
feet O
again O
; O
the O
earthquake O
can O
not O
shake O
the O
staunch O
will O
of O
the O
Chinese O
people O
; O
trials O
and O
tribulations O
serve O
only O
to O
revitalize O
a O
nation O
! O
" O

This O
enables O
us O
to O
see O
the O
fighting O
spirits O
of O
the O
dauntless O
Chinese O
nation O
give O
off O
a O
dazzling O
radiance O
among O
people O
in O
disaster O
- O
hit O
areas O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
these O
words O
are O
spoken O
by O
compatriots O
who O
have O
been O
through O
the O
disaster O
has O
given O
us O
, O
who O
could O
n't O
help O
our O
tears O
at O
the O
sight O
of O
their O
mishaps O
, O
so O
much O
comfort O
and O
encouragement O
. O

It O
gives O
us O
a O
hint O
that O
no O
force O
can O
beat O
down O
the O
Chinese O
people O
. O

However O
, O
the O
words O
-LRB- O
later O
-RRB- O
reappeared O
somewhere O
else O
and O
from O
someone O
unusual O
, O
which O
I O
thought O
about O
for O
a O
few O
days O
. O

I O
feel O
, O
for O
some O
unknown O
reason O
, O
it O
is O
somewhat O
scary O
! O

I O
just O
want O
to O
say O
, O
let O
there O
be O
no O
more O
disasters O
, O
so O
that O
China O
is O
safe O
and O
sound O
from O
now O
on O
and O
disasters O
are O
far O
away O
from O
China O
. O

I O
pray O
to O
the O
God O
to O
open O
his O
eyes O
and O
do O
n't O
let O
disasters O
visit O
the O
Chinese O
land O
again O
! O

We O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
revitalize O
the O
nation O
through O
trials O
and O
tribulations O
, O

but O
rather O
we O
want O
to O
revitalize O
the O
nation O
by O
passing O
our O
days O
safe O
and O
sound O
! O

Whether O
it O
is O
meant O
as O
an O
insult O
or O
compliment O
, O
I O
must O
say O
that O
this O
nickname O
" O
blue O
ants O
" O
is O
quite O
striking O
. O

Millions O
upon O
millions O
of O
little O
blue O
ants O
uniting O
together O
is O
a O
huge O
unstoppable O
force O
. O

Millions O
upon O
millions O
of O
little O
blue O
ants O
, O
each O
one O
industrious O
and O
pragmatic O
, O
diligent O
and O
dedicated O
, O
so O
self O
- O
confident O
, O
unhurried O
, O
relaxed O
and O
hard O
working O
. O

In O
those O
days O
, O
no O
matter O
which O
position O
we O
worked O
in O
, O
everybody O
was O
one O
cog O
in O
the O
wheel O
. O

Our O
motherland O
laid O
down O
the O
basically O
complete O
working O
foundation O
of O
the O
People O
's O
Republic O
with O
the O
labor O
of O
these O
very O
millions O
upon O
millions O
of O
blue O
ants O
, O
constructing O
a O
powerful O
national O
defense O
to O
protect O
the O
peace O
and O
tranquility O
of O
the O
homeland O
, O
pioneering O
the O
working O
people O
's O
very O
own O
revolutionary O
theatre O
. O

Recently O
I O
went O
to O
take O
a O
look O
at O
the O
Changxing O
coal O
mine O
. O

I O
arrived O
just O
when O
the O
miners O
were O
changing O
shifts O
, O
emerging O
one O
by O
one O
, O
faces O
black O
as O
soot O
, O
with O
just O
their O
eyes O
appearing O
especially O
white O
. O
Just O
like O
a O
lot O
of O
black O
ants O
. O

I O
had O
a O
chat O
with O
them O
. O

They O
said O
, O
" O
In O
the O
Mao O
Zedong O
era O
it O
was O
glorious O
to O
be O
a O
miner O
, O
wages O
were O
higher O
than O
other O
occupations O
, O
the O
bosses O
really O
cared O
about O
the O
workers O
, O
and O
also O
often O
went O
down O
the O
mines O
to O
help O
out O
with O
the O
labor O
. O
" O

In O
1955 O
, O
U.S. O
cartoon O
magnate O
Walt O
Disney O
set O
up O
the O
first O
modern O
style O
amusement O
park O
in O
California O
, O
moving O
in O
one O
by O
one O
all O
the O
vivid O
animated O
characters O
from O
his O
films O
. O

In O
this O
amusement O
park O
, O
named O
after O
Disney O
himself O
, O
not O
only O
could O
children O
play O
with O
life O
- O
sized O
cartoon O
figures O
, O
they O
could O
also O
drive O
futurized O
cars O
, O
ride O
in O
Mississippi O
- O
style O
paddle O
steamers O
, O
lose O
themselves O
in O
medieval O
castles O
, O
or O
take O
a O
stroll O
through O
the O
streets O
of O
America O
. O

From O
then O
on O
, O
Disneyland O
became O
the O
promised O
land O
dreamed O
about O
by O
countless O
kids O
all O
over O
the O
world O
, O
influencing O
generation O
after O
generation O
of O
little O
and O
not O
- O
so O
- O
little O
kids O
. O

After O
more O
than O
half O
a O
century O
, O
Disneyland O
's O
fame O
and O
appeal O
continues O
to O
grow O
, O
creating O
astonishing O
wealth O
for O
the O
Disney O
group O
. O

Theme O
parks O
account O
for O
forty O
percent O
of O
Disney O
's O
annual O
revenue O
. O

But O
who O
could O
have O
thought O
that O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
the O
value O
created O
by O
this O
theme O
park O
is O
derived O
from O
services O
. O

Recently O
, O
while O
I O
was O
reading O
a O
book O
on O
management O
, O
I O
had O
this O
feeling O
of O
being O
suddenly O
enlightened O
. O

The O
book O
said O
that O
the O
Disneyland O
in O
Tokyo O
, O
Japan O
was O
packed O
to O
the O
brim O
with O
crowds O
everyday O
. O

There O
have O
been O
lots O
of O
earthquake O
documentations O
since O
ancient O
China O
, O
as O
well O
as O
many O
records O
about O
observations O
of O
the O
nature O
. O

These O
are O
all O
valuable O
legacies O
our O
ancestors O
have O
left O
us O
. O

Have O
we O
treasured O
them O
? O

How O
many O
people O
are O
studying O
these O
documentations O
and O
records O
? O

Have O
those O
who O
conduct O
their O
research O
from O
this O
perspective O
received O
due O
attention O
? O

Have O
their O
results O
been O
applied O
to O
practice O
? O

Western O
countries O
lack O
such O
historic O
accumulation O
-LRB- O
of O
course O
it O
's O
not O
they O
do O
n't O
have O
any O
-RRB- O
, O
so O
they O
could O
only O
rely O
more O
on O
modern O
technological O
methods O
and O
attach O
greater O
importance O
to O
the O
data O
recorded O
by O
instruments O
. O

But O
we O
, O
doing O
nothing O
with O
the O
valuable O
experience O
and O
precious O
data O
left O
by O
our O
ancestors O
, O
have O
been O
making O
efforts O
like O
fools O
along O
Western O
research O
directions O
. O

For O
the O
science O
of O
earthquake O
observation O
, O
maybe O
experts O
believe O
neither O
toads O
crossing O
the O
street O
nor O
birds O
flushing O
are O
reliable O
, O
nor O
are O
ants O
climbing O
trees O
, O
mice O
moving O
, O
fish O
jumping O
over O
the O
pond O
, O
and O
abnormal O
behaviors O
of O
cats O
and O
dogs O
. O

Even O
, O
sparking O
wells O
, O
abnormal O
weather O
, O
and O
even O
the O
appearance O
of O
earthquake O
clouds O
are O
more O
absurd O
and O
unreasonable O
.... O

However O
, O
can O
experts O
give O
a O
reliable O
way O
of O
observation O
? O

Geoelectricity O
, O
magnetic O
fields O
and O
foreshocks O
... O
etc. O
, O
or O
maybe O
other O
more O
advanced O
acoustic O
, O
optic O
and O
electric O
methods O
, O
provided O
that O
only O
those O
observation O
methods O
using O
instruments O
to O
record O
are O
reliable O
. O

This O
is O
typical O
ruining O
one O
's O
own O
skills O
. O

Allowing O
citizens O
freedom O
of O
expression O
would O
make O
the O
government O
continually O
improve O
its O
ability O
to O
rectify O
mistakes O
. O

Clashes O
engendered O
by O
the O
intensity O
of O
conflicts O
between O
some O
local O
governments O
and O
the O
general O
public O
have O
created O
very O
bad O
social O
effects O
. O

An O
important O
reason O
is O
that O
prior O
to O
this O
, O
people O
's O
channels O
for O
freedom O
of O
expression O
were O
blocked O
, O
and O
that O
in O
apparently O
calm O
seas O
it O
is O
easy O
for O
the O
helmsmen O
to O
relax O
vigilance O
. O

Hence O
, O
some O
local O
governments O
always O
believe O
themselves O
to O
be O
definitely O
right O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
public O
policymaking O
. O

And O
when O
the O
situation O
has O
developed O
to O
a O
considerable O
extent O
, O
for O
example O
, O
a O
large O
project O
has O
already O
absorbed O
huge O
preliminary O
funds O
and O
a O
contradiction O
suddenly O
erupts O
, O
the O
government O
departments O
concerned O
will O
find O
themselves O
caught O
in O
an O
impasse O
, O
with O
huge O
social O
costs O
to O
be O
borne O
no O
matter O
how O
it O
is O
dealt O
with O
. O

If O
the O
government O
wants O
to O
make O
fewer O
errors O
, O
then O
it O
should O
allow O
the O
people O
freedom O
of O
expression O
. O

When O
Gun O
tried O
to O
control O
the O
floodwaters O
, O
he O
was O
unable O
to O
stop O
the O
billowing O
floodwaters O
with O
soil O
, O
and O
was O
finally O
killed O
by O
Shun O
on O
Yushan O
. O

His O
son O
, O
Yu O
the O
Great O
, O
took O
a O
different O
approach O
from O
his O
father O
's O
, O
and O
adopted O
the O
dredging O
method O
, O
calming O
the O
floodwaters O
several O
years O
later O
. O

We O
can O
catch O
a O
glimpse O
of O
the O
political O
wisdom O
of O
the O
ancient O
Chinese O
from O
this O
ancient O
myth O
, O
whose O
message O
remains O
valid O
till O
the O
present O
day O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
the O
higher O
the O
level O
of O
fortification O
, O
the O
more O
money O
it O
will O
=cost O
. O

What O
's O
the O
significance O
of O
this O
kind O
of O
fortification O
? O

The O
significance O
is O
when O
an O
earthquake O
really O
strikes O
, O
safety O
can O
be O
guaranteed O
for O
the O
buildings O
that O
meet O
earthquake O
- O
resistance O
standards O
. O

Take O
commercial O
buildings O
for O
example O
. O

Level O
eight O
fortification O
means O
that O
if O
the O
earthquake O
intensity O
of O
the O
local O
area O
is O
below O
the O
seventh O
level O
, O
a O
commercial O
building O
will O
not O
be O
damaged O
, O
will O
not O
need O
repairs O
, O
and O
can O
continue O
to O
be O
used O
normally O
. O

If O
earthquake O
intensity O
reaches O
the O
eighth O
level O
, O
commercial O
buildings O
can O
continue O
to O
be O
used O
after O
necessary O
repairs O
, O
but O
will O
not O
collapse O
and O
people O
's O
lives O
and O
safety O
will O
not O
be O
threatened O
. O

If O
earthquake O
intensity O
reaches O
the O
ninth O
level O
, O
commercial O
buildings O
will O
not O
collapse O
and O
will O
not O
threaten O
people O
's O
lives O
and O
safety O
. O

Our O
country O
still O
does O
n't O
have O
fortification O
standards O
higher O
than O
level O
9 O
; O
the O
basic O
intensity O
of O
most O
areas O
is O
level O
7 O
. O

That O
is O
to O
say O
, O
if O
the O
national O
standards O
for O
earthquake O
resistance O
were O
strictly O
enforced O
, O
buildings O
should O
n't O
collapse O
. O

With O
so O
much O
said O
, O
now O
we O
can O
start O
analyzing O
the O
questions O
concerning O
the O
collapse O
of O
the O
school O
buildings O
and O
public O
buildings O
. O

Why O
did O
so O
many O
school O
buildings O
and O
hospitals O
=crack O
and O
collapse O
so O
severely O
in O
this O
earthquake O
? O

Many O
people O
suspect O
there O
had O
been O
jerry O
- O
built O
projects O
, O
which O
is O
understandable O
. O

But O
proof O
and O
scientific O
analysis O
are O
required O
to O
prove O
this O
suspicion O
. O

No O
matter O
whether O
the O
school O
buildings O
are O
dangerous O
or O
are O
beautiful O
" O
jerry O
- O
built O
buildings O
, O
" O
as O
far O
as O
this O
writer O
knows O
, O
China O
's O
laws O
and O
regulations O
concerning O
construction O
contracts O
are O
very O
complete O
. O

Why O
are O
there O
so O
many O
" O
jerry O
- O
built O
projects O
? O
" O

Because O
the O
" O
owners O
" O
are O
the O
government O
and O
the O
competent O
education O
departments O
. O

When O
people O
in O
possession O
of O
huge O
power O
indulge O
in O
their O
own O
desires O
, O
it O
will O
breed O
corruption O
, O
which O
leads O
to O
sale O
and O
purchase O
of O
official O
posts O
as O
well O
as O
all O
kinds O
of O
" O
jerry O
- O
built O
projects O
. O
" O

Those O
contractors O
who O
like O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
loopholes O
in O
the O
government O
's O
monitoring O
and O
regulations O
, O
they O
know O
that O
the O
cost O
of O
=bribing O
several O
government O
officials O
is O
far O
less O
than O
that O
of O
reducing O
construction O
expenses O
. O

Therefore O
, O
in O
the O
past O
few O
years O
, O
the O
corruption O
in O
the O
education O
sector O
that O
common O
people O
have O
strongly O
lashed O
out O
against O
includes O
precisely O
the O
lack O
of O
openness O
and O
transparency O
concerning O
school O
building O
construction O
, O
which O
has O
led O
to O
the O
non-existence O
of O
rules O
and O
regulations O
for O
project O
management O
and O
the O
sloppy O
enforcement O
of O
quality O
inspection O
, O
leaving O
behind O
large O
numbers O
of O
hazards O
for O
potential O
accidents O
. O

This O
earthquake O
was O
just O
a O
comprehensive O
explosion O
; O
that O
's O
all O
. O

Facing O
the O
" O
jerry O
- O
built O
projects O
, O
" O
some O
leaders O
in O
the O
government O
and O
educational O
departments O
could O
=deny O
by O
all O
means O
what O
they O
did O
and O
could O
put O
the O
blame O
on O
this O
sudden O
natural O
disaster O
, O
but O
how O
could O
they O
also O
get O
rid O
of O
their O
own O
conscience O
, O
and O
how O
could O
they O
face O
those O
parents O
who O
lost O
their O
children O
! O

Even O
so O
, O
donation O
behavior O
and O
the O
treatment O
of O
donation O
behavior O
should O
not O
deviate O
from O
two O
principles O
, O
namely O
that O
it O
is O
voluntary O
and O
does O
not O
seek O
return O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
the O
donation O
loses O
its O
original O
meaning O
. O

In O
actual O
fact O
, O
whether O
it O
is O
McDonalds O
or O
any O
other O
foreign O
owned O
enterprises O
in O
China O
on O
the O
so O
- O
called O
" O
international O
iron O
rooster O
" O
blacklist O
, O
they O
all O
gave O
generously O
to O
the O
cause O
of O
helping O
the O
disaster O
victims O
, O
exhibiting O
their O
social O
responsibility O
. O

Even O
if O
by O
comparison O
some O
companies O
really O
did O
n't O
donate O
a O
huge O
amount O
, O
they O
should O
not O
be O
besieged O
or O
subjected O
to O
verbal O
violence O
in O
the O
arena O
of O
public O
opinion O
. O

Donating O
, O
after O
all O
, O
is O
not O
a O
legal O
obligation O
that O
companies O
must O
carry O
out O
. O

Urging O
businesses O
to O
donate O
apart O
from O
the O
force O
of O
moral O
considerations O
should O
not O
take O
the O
form O
of O
any O
other O
coercive O
means O
. O

As O
long O
as O
a O
company O
's O
source O
of O
income O
is O
legal O
, O
any O
compulsory O
payment O
outside O
of O
legal O
obligations O
is O
a O
kind O
of O
theft O
. O

Even O
in O
an O
abnormal O
circumstance O
such O
as O
disaster O
relief O
, O
legal O
order O
and O
the O
rights O
bestowed O
upon O
by O
law O
should O
be O
respected O
. O

If O
we O
are O
unfortunate O
enough O
to O
be O
unable O
to O
avoid O
becoming O
a O
disaster O
victim O
, O
we O
can O
at O
least O
preserve O
the O
nobility O
and O
dignity O
of O
humanity O
and O
not O
turn O
into O
rabble O
. O

As O
far O
as O
handling O
of O
the O
issue O
of O
the O
" O
Gang O
of O
Four O
" O
goes O
, O
till O
now O
, O
people O
are O
still O
striving O
for O
merit O
and O
fawning O
on O
. O

Little O
do O
they O
know O
that O
breaking O
up O
the O
" O
Gang O
of O
Four O
" O
is O
an O
illegal O
, O
disdainful O
coup O
that O
violates O
internal O
party O
regulations O
. O

Any O
struggle O
in O
the O
CPC O
history O
has O
always O
been O
completed O
through O
legitimate O
conventions O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
matter O
whether O
or O
not O
the O
content O
is O
right O
, O
such O
as O
Gao O
Gang O
, O
Peng O
Dehuai O
, O
Liu O
Shaoqi O
, O
Hua O
Guofeng O
, O
Hu O
Yaobang O
, O
and O
Zhao O
Ziyang O
; O
and O
also O
Chen O
Duxiu O
, O
Qu O
Qiubai O
, O
Li O
Lisan O
, O
Bo O
Gu O
, O
Wang O
Ming O
, O
and O
so O
on O
, O
the O
rules O
and O
procedures O
were O
all O
followed O
. O

But O
the O
handling O
of O
the O
" O
Gang O
of O
Four O
" O
violated O
procedures O
. O

Here O
I O
'm O
not O
saying O
whether O
or O
not O
the O
handling O
of O
Jiang O
Qing O
and O
the O
other O
people O
was O
wrong O
, O
I O
'm O
just O
saying O
that O
the O
method O
of O
handling O
was O
ridiculous O
. O

The O
way O
that O
Hua O
Guofeng O
's O
people O
handled O
the O
issue O
of O
Jiang O
Qing O
was O
completely O
different O
from O
the O
way O
that O
Deng O
Xiaoping O
later O
handled O
the O
issue O
of O
Jiang O
Qing O
. O

The O
way O
Hua O
Guofeng O
handled O
the O
" O
Gang O
of O
Four O
" O
was O
a O
power O
struggle O
. O

The O
starting O
point O
was O
not O
a O
struggle O
of O
political O
courses O
, O
but O
of O
personal O
ambition O
. O

Hua O
Guofeng O
and O
Jiang O
Qing O
were O
on O
the O
same O
political O
course O
. O

The O
struggle O
between O
Deng O
Xiaoping O
and O
the O
" O
Gang O
of O
Four O
" O
was O
over O
political O
course O
disagreements O
, O
and O
not O
a O
fight O
over O
personal O
power O
. O

For O
people O
like O
Hua O
Guofeng O
and O
Wang O
Dongxing O
, O
within O
the O
party O
a O
proposal O
for O
a O
=just O
treatment O
would O
be O
made O
sooner O
or O
later O
. O

The O
Communist O
Party O
of O
China O
should O
not O
, O
under O
any O
circumstances O
, O
allow O
any O
illegal O
feuds O
within O
the O
party O
to O
happen O
again O
. O

Imagine O
for O
a O
moment O
what O
would O
the O
scene O
have O
been O
like O
if O
the O
earthquake O
had O
struck O
in O
a O
fully O
- O
marketized O
China O
? O

In O
that O
time O
, O
the O
government O
itself O
would O
clearly O
not O
have O
the O
same O
power O
as O
it O
has O
now O
. O

With O
no O
state O
- O
owned O
enterprises O
, O
no O
family O
collectives O
either O
, O
everything O
individualized O
-LRB- O
privatized O
-RRB- O
, O
no O
resources O
in O
the O
hand O
, O
the O
government O
would O
need O
to O
depend O
on O
the O
conduct O
of O
the O
rich O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
who O
is O
left O
for O
the O
government O
to O
rule O
in O
" O
small O
government O
, O
big O
society O
" O
? O

Are O
n't O
they O
doing O
parachute O
drops O
? O

With O
no O
oil O
for O
aviation O
, O
petroleum O
refining O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
capitalists O
, O
who O
would O
you O
go O
to O
? O

Right O
now O
, O
one O
word O
, O
one O
phone O
call O
and O
it O
's O
done O
! O

Not O
done O
? O

Only O
if O
he O
did O
n't O
want O
the O
job O
! O

Say O
the O
earthquake O
zone O
really O
needs O
tents O
and O
the O
central O
government O
directly O
gives O
the O
order O
for O
manufacturers O
to O
start O
planning O
- O
how O
much O
they O
need O
, O
when O
they O
should O
be O
ready O
- O
who O
would O
dare O
to O
disobey O
? O

They O
would O
n't O
dare O
to O
disobey O
, O
and O
also O
would O
n't O
dare O
to O
raise O
prices O
arbitrarily O
. O

If O
everything O
was O
privatized O
, O
market O
- O
operated O
, O
and O
the O
government O
purchased O
on O
a O
large O
scale O
, O
supplying O
factories O
would O
grab O
the O
chance O
to O
drive O
up O
prices O
, O
and O
flog O
off O
shoddy O
seconds O
as O
high O
- O
quality O
products O
. O

And O
so O
, O
cases O
like O
the O
evil O
- O
minded O
capitalists O
in O
Shanghai O
swindling O
the O
people O
we O
loved O
the O
most O
during O
the O
time O
of O
the O
War O
to O
Resist O
US O
Aggression O
and O
Aid O
Korea O
would O
re-emerge O
. O

Whether O
the O
Cultural O
Revolution O
was O
correct O
or O
not O
, O
the O
CCP O
launched O
it O
after O
legally O
passing O
it O
through O
resolution O
documents O
and O
assembly O
form O
. O

The O
decision O
to O
bring O
out O
the O
Cultural O
Revolution O
was O
approved O
by O
the O
vast O
majority O
in O
the O
Central O
Committee O
- O
not O
only O
Mao O
Zedong O
, O
Zhou O
Enlai O
, O
Zhu O
De O
, O
and O
Lin O
Biao O
endorsed O
it O
, O
but O
also O
Liu O
Shaoqi O
, O
Deng O
Shaoping O
, O
Chen O
Yun O
and O
such O
old O
revolutionaries O
threw O
in O
their O
votes O
of O
endorsement O
. O

While O
after O
the O
Cultural O
Revolution O
, O
the O
CCP O
official O
and O
media O
's O
verdict O
on O
the O
Cultural O
Revolution O
was O
that O
it O
was O
internal O
disorder O
and O
disaster O
, O
and O
their O
denouncing O
as O
counter-revolutionaries O
of O
Lin O
Biao O
, O
Jiang O
Qing O
and O
those O
leaders O
, O
cadres O
, O
and O
numerous O
red O
guards O
who O
had O
faithfully O
executed O
CCP O
policy O
was O
absurd O
in O
the O
extreme O
. O

If O
the O
Cultural O
Revolution O
was O
wrong O
, O
it O
went O
wrong O
with O
the O
Party O
headquarters O
, O
with O
Chairman O
Mao O
. O

If O
Lin O
Biao O
and O
the O
" O
Gang O
of O
Four O
" O
had O
a O
problem O
, O
it O
was O
that O
they O
were O
extreme O
left O
, O
no O
question O
of O
being O
counter-revolutionaries O
, O
rather O
that O
they O
revolted O
a O
bit O
too O
much O
. O

The O
CCP O
Cultural O
Revolution O
is O
a O
part O
of O
CCP O
history O
, O
it O
can O
not O
be O
cut O
out O
, O

and O
during O
it O
, O
many O
good O
things O
at O
least O
did O
happen O
. O

It O
can O
not O
be O
simply O
written O
off O
as O
internal O
disorder O
and O
disaster O
. O

Trying O
to O
deliver O
a O
verdict O
on O
the O
Cultural O
Revolution O
whilst O
in O
a O
parochial O
and O
emotional O
frame O
of O
mind O
is O
incredibly O
frivolous O
, O
incredibly O
flippant O
and O
it O
will O
certainly O
not O
stand O
up O
to O
the O
test O
of O
time O
, O
and O
will O
be O
laughed O
at O
. O

In O
being O
determined O
to O
make O
the O
Cultural O
Revolution O
, O
which O
the O
CCP O
passed O
through O
formal O
legal O
assembly O
, O
out O
as O
a O
counter-revolutionary O
incident O
, O
saying O
it O
was O
internal O
disorder O
and O
disaster O
is O
the O
CCP O
smearing O
itself O
, O
totally O
uncalled O
for O
, O
and O
is O
the O
second O
absurdity O
in O
the O
CCP O
's O
history O
. O

On O
May O
20 O
, O
the O
McDonald O
's O
in O
the O
city O
of O
Nanchong O
, O
China O
, O
was O
attacked O
by O
crowds O
, O
as O
besiegers O
said O
the O
McDonald O
's O
has O
donated O
too O
little O
for O
disaster O
relief O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
a O
text O
message O
of O
" O
international O
iron O
cocks O
" O
is O
also O
circulated O
across O
China O
, O
which O
blacklists O
well O
- O
known O
international O
companies O
that O
have O
made O
a O
fortune O
in O
China O
but O
donated O
little O
to O
the O
disaster O
- O
hit O
areas O
. O

Klaus O
Deuse O
, O
a O
reporter O
with O
Deutsche O
Welle O
, O
thinks O
making O
donations O
is O
a O
moral O
rather O
than O
a O
legal O
obligation O
. O

Forced O
donation O
is O
against O
the O
meaning O
of O
donating O
and O
may O
be O
suspected O
of O
doing O
violence O
in O
charity O
's O
name O
. O

Such O
a O
behavior O
will O
only O
hurt O
the O
good O
image O
that O
Chinese O
have O
presented O
to O
the O
world O
in O
the O
earthquake O
rescue O
and O
relief O
efforts O
this O
time O
. O

Following O
the O
great O
earthquake O
in O
Sichuan O
, O
China O
, O
Chinese O
people O
both O
at O
home O
and O
abroad O
have O
become O
united O
as O
never O
before O
, O
demonstrating O
unprecedented O
love O
and O
philanthropy O
. O

Countless O
touching O
stories O
able O
to O
move O
people O
to O
tears O
have O
been O
told O
during O
the O
disaster O
relief O
. O

People O
of O
all O
social O
circles O
, O
whether O
rich O
or O
poor O
, O
have O
donated O
generously O
, O
showcasing O
the O
good O
quality O
and O
moral O
height O
of O
Chinese O
nationals O
. O

The O
natural O
disaster O
has O
kindled O
love O
and O
courage O
of O
the O
Chinese O
people O
. O

Two O
big O
words O
" O
human O
nature O
" O
were O
written O
on O
earth O
when O
the O
disaster O
was O
over O
. O

One O
important O
reason O
that O
a O
great O
number O
of O
people O
buried O
or O
trapped O
in O
debris O
in O
the O
Wenchuan O
earthquake O
- O
hit O
area O
were O
saved O
is O
that O
they O
were O
full O
of O
hopes O
and O
firmly O
believed O
the O
PLA O
would O
come O
to O
their O
rescue O
! O

To O
settle O
victims O
, O
thousands O
of O
tents O
that O
stretched O
miles O
were O
soon O
set O
up O
, O
which O
contained O
public O
toilets O
, O
shops O
, O
and O
primary O
schools O
and O
middle O
schools O
. O

Tens O
of O
thousands O
or O
even O
millions O
of O
those O
displaced O
by O
the O
disaster O
have O
gradually O
had O
a O
home O
to O
shelter O
from O
the O
wind O
and O
rain O
! O

If O
everything O
were O
put O
in O
the O
market O
, O
such O
that O
all O
the O
land O
was O
sold O
to O
syndicates O
or O
farm O
owners O
, O
then O
where O
should O
the O
government O
set O
up O
tents O
? O

Do O
they O
expropriate O
the O
land O
on O
the O
spot O
? O

Even O
the O
government O
can O
not O
override O
the O
market O
! O

Supporting O
the O
disaster O
- O
hit O
areas O
has O
tested O
our O
competence O
, O
while O
the O
government O
's O
ability O
to O
rule O
also O
stood O
the O
trial O
! O

At O
critical O
moments O
, O
the O
ruling O
foundation O
--- O
workers O
and O
farmers O
, O
showed O
staunch O
support O
to O
the O
government O
! O

If O
everything O
were O
put O
in O
the O
market O
, O
such O
that O
workers O
and O
farmers O
would O
have O
their O
fates O
controlled O
by O
the O
market O
and O
no O
longer O
count O
on O
or O
rely O
on O
the O
government O
by O
walking O
onto O
a O
path O
of O
the O
so O
- O
called O
" O
finding O
the O
market O
rather O
than O
the O
mayor O
-LRB- O
government O
-RRB- O
, O
" O
then O
what O
power O
would O
the O
government O
have O
? O

The O
post-catastrophe O
hyperinflation O
as O
expected O
by O
foreigners O
has O
not O
come O
either O
! O

The O
government O
has O
human O
and O
financial O
capital O
under O
control O
, O
as O
well O
as O
energy O
and O
resources O
! O

Although O
Wen O
Jiabao O
then O
requested O
that O
access O
to O
disaster O
- O
hit O
areas O
be O
made O
available O
by O
midnight O
the O
13th O
, O
it O
was O
until O
21.30 O
hours O
on O
the O
15th O
that O
relevant O
rescuers O
connected O
the O
road O
from O
Li O
County O
to O
Wenchuan O
for O
the O
first O
time O
, O
which O
was O
already O
79 O
hours O
after O
the O
earthquake O
. O

It O
should O
be O
noted O
that O
at O
the O
time O
, O
rescuers O
were O
still O
unable O
to O
access O
34 O
of O
the O
58 O
townships O
affected O
by O
the O
disaster O
. O

Everyone O
who O
has O
read O
Li O
Bai O
's O
poem O
knows O
, O
" O
the O
roads O
in O
Shu O
are O
so O
harsh O
that O
they O
are O
even O
harsher O
than O
going O
to O
the O
sky O
, O
" O
which O
indicates O
how O
harsh O
and O
dangerous O
geographical O
conditions O
are O
in O
Sichuan O
. O

The O
mankind O
is O
now O
in O
the O
21st O
world O
. O

Under O
the O
modern O
technological O
conditions O
, O
two O
methods O
, O
midair O
helicopters O
and O
quick O
road O
repair O
by O
ground O
engineers O
and O
technicians O
, O
should O
be O
the O
preferred O
effective O
methods O
to O
rescue O
people O
in O
emergency O
situations O
in O
the O
great O
mountainous O
areas O
of O
Sichuan O
. O

When O
quick O
road O
connection O
on O
the O
ground O
encounters O
difficulties O
, O
accessing O
disaster O
- O
hit O
areas O
by O
air O
should O
be O
more O
efficient O
. O

It O
's O
true O
that O
faced O
with O
such O
a O
great O
disaster O
, O
it O
's O
more O
crucial O
to O
repair O
damaged O
roads O
. O

And O
it O
must O
rely O
on O
well O
- O
trained O
and O
flexible O
professional O
technical O
teams O
with O
hands O
- O
on O
experience O
who O
would O
" O
carve O
out O
a O
road O
at O
a O
mountain O
and O
set O
up O
a O
bridge O
at O
a O
river O
. O
" O

However O
, O
none O
of O
these O
were O
realized O
. O

Nine O
Dragons O

went O

in O

On O
the O

she O
looks O
plain O

just O
like O
the O

" O

But O
, O
it O
is O
this O
" O
Dragon O
Queen O
" O
who O
has O
built O
a O
fortune O
starting O
as O
a O
wage O
earner O
, O
who O
shrewdly O
and O
effectively O
put O
forward O
these O
three O
proposals O
: O
" O
exemptions O
from O
permanent O
work O
contracts O
, O
" O
" O
reducing O
the O
tax O

" O
a O
transitional O
tax O
- O
exempt O
period O
for O

protection O
equipment O
. O
" O

This O
wage O
earner O
who O
built O
her O
fortune O
from O
scratch O
has O
finally O
completed O
the O
entire O
process O
from O
a O
worker O
to O
a O
spokesperson O
for O
the O
bosses O
, O
and O
totally O
sides O
with O
the O
bosses O
. O

If O
you O
think O
this O
is O
someone O
who O
has O
experienced O
life O
as O
a O
worker O
and O
who O
will O
be O
always O
soft O
on O
the O
workers O
to O
some O
extent O

will O
still O
have O
a O
bit O
of O
compassion O
left O
for O
her O
same O
kind O
when O
she O
becomes O
a O
boss O
, O
then O
you O
are O
wrong O
. O

The O
three O
proposals O
of O
the O
Dragon O
Queen O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
likes O
of O
" O
sweatshops O
" O
which O
have O
come O
under O
heavy O
criticism O
, O
have O
mercilessly O
smashed O
people O
's O
illusions O
. O

After O
organizing O
donations O
for O
disaster O
relief O
from O
staff O
in O
my O
work O
unit O
, O
this O
party O
member O
, O
in O
line O
with O
standards O
stipulated O
by O
higher O
authorities O
, O
of O
course O
, O
made O
a O
further O
" O
voluntary O
contribution O
" O
also O
. O

Thinking O
of O
how O
" O
you O
can O
do O
nothing O
without O
money O
" O
today O
, O
and O
also O
how O
desperate O
the O
people O
of O
the O
disaster O
zone O
and O
the O
public O
finances O
of O
the O
disaster O
zone O
are O
, O
this O
party O
member O
was O
truly O
happy O
with O
this O
" O
special O
effort O
. O
" O

But O
on O
a O
second O
thought O
, O
I O
felt O
that O
maybe O
there O
were O
many O
people O
who O
ought O
to O
feel O
elated O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
people O
like O
He O
Weifang O
and O
Gao O
Shangquan O
in O
the O
new O
" O
Western O
Hills O
Meeting O
" O
faction O
, O
which O
claims O
" O
the O
Communist O
Party O
has O
broken O
the O
law O
, O
" O
are O
certain O
to O
be O
secretly O
elated O
. O

Can O
the O
people O
who O
curse O
the O
Communist O
Party O
and O
hope O
the O
Communist O
Party O
falls O
from O
power O
still O
have O
the O
party O
spirit O
, O
a O
public O
spirit O
and O
a O
spirit O
of O
compassion O
for O
the O
people O
? O

Therefore O
, O
to O
say O
that O
people O
like O
He O
Weifang O
will O
" O
be O
secretly O
elated O
" O
is O
firstly O
because O
these O
devious O
and O
sharp O
- O
nosed O
poodles O
and O
flunkies O
of O
the O
foreigners O
will O
definitely O
find O
through O
these O
" O
special O
party O
membership O
dues O
" O
that O
" O
special O
party O
members O
" O
are O
created O
based O
on O
the O
amounts O
of O
their O
payments O
of O
dues O
, O
and O
there O
will O
even O
be O
" O
good O
" O
cases O
where O
some O
private O
entrepreneurs O
are O
quickly O
admitted O
into O
the O
party O
due O
to O
their O
large O
sums O
of O
donations O
without O
having O
to O
forgo O
exploitation O
. O

Secondly O
, O
they O
have O
been O
extremely O
aware O
that O
for O
many O
years O
, O
rich O
upstarts O
who O
have O
used O
their O
official O
powers O
to O
seek O
personal O
gains O
and O
embezzled O
public O
money O
to O
fatten O
their O
private O
wallets O
under O
the O
pretext O
of O
reform O
are O
, O
after O
all O
, O
a O
handful O
of O
leading O
party O
cadres O
in O
power O
, O
and O
that O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
party O
members O
and O
ordinary O
cadres O
in O
the O
party O
not O
only O
would O
find O
it O
hard O
to O
strike O
it O
rich O
, O
but O
would O
even O
consider O
it O
not O
bad O
just O
to O
stay O
out O
of O
poverty O
. O

May O
12 O
, O
2008 O
, O
the O
Chinese O
history O
will O
always O
remember O
this O
day O
. O

China O
experienced O
a O
great O
earthquake O
rarely O
seen O
in O
history O
, O
which O
aroused O
the O
concern O
of O
the O
Chinese O
nation O
including O
people O
of O
Chinese O
origins O
across O
the O
globe O
. O

Several O
hours O
after O
the O
earthquake O
, O
the O
respected O
premier O
, O
an O
old O
man O
66 O
years O
of O
age O
who O
was O
a O
thousand O
miles O
away O
, O
risked O
his O
life O
to O
appear O
at O
the O
front O
line O
in O
Sichuan O
's O
worst O
- O
hit O
disaster O
area O
. O

Several O
dozen O
thousand O
PLA O
and O
Armed O
Police O
troops O
marched O
a O
thousand O
miles O
and O
appeared O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
could O
on O
the O
scene O
of O
disaster O
- O
hit O
areas O
. O

China O
Central O
Television O
, O
China O
National O
Radio O
and O
others O
cut O
short O
their O
normal O
broadcasting O
schedules O
and O
committed O
themselves O
to O
live O
broadcast O
throughout O
the O
disaster O
- O
rescue O
effort O
. O

One O
hoarse O
voice O
after O
another O
spread O
across O
the O
Chinese O
land O
through O
these O
media O
, O
over O
which O
so O
many O
hot O
- O
blooded O
young O
people O
shed O
their O
tears O
. O

My O
blood O
surged O
when O
I O
, O
who O
seldom O
watch O
TV O
, O
saw O
the O
premier O
made O
the O
promise O
in O
a O
choking O
and O
hoarse O
voice O
to O
the O
orphans O
who O
lost O
their O
families O
, O
" O
the O
government O
will O
not O
leave O
you O
alone O
and O
will O
take O
care O
of O
you O
as O
if O
you O
were O
home O
. O
" O

I O
believe O
every O
Chinese O
son O
or O
daughter O
who O
sees O
the O
scene O
will O
be O
moved O
. O

When O
I O
took O
a O
look O
at O
the O
headline O
pictures O
of O
the O
earthquake O
on O
the O
front O
as O
well O
as O
the O
following O
pages O
of O
today O
's O
Shenzhen O
Economic O
Daily O
, O
I O
invariably O
noticed O
the O
steel O
reinforcing O
bars O
exposed O
from O
the O
broken O
- O
off O
steel O
reinforced O
concrete O
in O
the O
collapsed O
rubble O
. O

I O
immediately O
wondered O
if O
the O
grade O
of O
this O
steel O
reinforced O
concrete O
was O
up O
to O
standard O
? O

What O
about O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
steel O
reinforcing O
bars O
? O

Because O
I O
could O
also O
clearly O
see O
the O
firm O
- O
standing O
residential O
buildings O
and O
other O
buildings O
right O
beside O
the O
collapsed O
ruins O
. O

Therefore O
, O
it O
is O
suggested O
in O
this O
post O
that O
after O
the O
disaster O
, O
the O
builders O
of O
all O
the O
buildings O
that O
completely O
collapsed O
or O
did O
n't O
completely O
collapse O
should O
be O
found O
. O

The O
builders O
of O
the O
buildings O
that O
did O
n't O
collapse O
should O
be O
graded O
up O
. O

The O
builders O
of O
the O
collapsed O
buildings O
should O
be O
graded O
down O
, O
and O
maybe O
even O
prosecuted O
as O
criminals O
. O

The O
government O
should O
provide O
financial O
subsidies O
to O
the O
builders O
with O
positive O
grades O
and O
award O
them O
with O
some O
titles O
of O
credibility O
. O

For O
builders O
with O
negative O
grades O
, O
even O
if O
no O
issues O
of O
violation O
of O
law O
have O
been O
found O
, O
what O
happened O
to O
their O
buildings O
should O
still O
be O
publicized O
, O
and O
the O
earthquake O
- O
resistance O
statistics O
of O
buildings O
by O
some O
construction O
companies O
should O
be O
calculated O
. O

I O
remember O
that O
during O
the O
era O
of O
Mao O
Zedong O
, O
foreigners O
who O
had O
been O
to O
the O
new O
China O
gave O
our O
country O
's O
working O
class O
a O
name O
; O
it O
is O
called O
-LRB- O
blue O
ants O
-RRB- O
. O

Before O
that O
, O
in O
the O
old O
China O
, O
our O
country O
's O
laborers O
were O
in O
a O
disunited O
state O
capable O
of O
doing O
nothing O
. O

After O
=England O
exported O
large O
amounts O
of O
opium O
to O
our O
country O
, O
causing O
drugs O
to O
run O
rampant O
throughout O
our O
country O
, O
the O
foreigners O
also O
gave O
us O
a O
nickname O
: O
" O
East O
Asian O
weaklings O
. O
" O

And O
because O
of O
this O
, O
they O
bullied O
our O
country O
over O
and O
over O
again O
, O
and O
with O
the O
reasonable O
cooperation O
of O
our O
shameless O
ruling O
group O
, O
many O
unfair O
=traitor O
treaties O
were O
signed O
. O

After O
the O
new O
China O
was O
established O
, O
the O
Chinese O
people O
rose O
up O
under O
the O
leadership O
of O
the O
Communist O
Party O
led O
by O
Chairman O
Mao O
. O

We O
drove O
out O
the O
imperialistic O
foreign O
firms O
and O
their O
agents O
, O
and O
walked O
the O
economic O
development O
path O
of O
-LRB- O
independence O
, O
self O
- O
reliance O
and O
self O
- O
renovation O
-RRB- O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
the O
laborers O
did O
n't O
think O
much O
about O
dressing O
up O
or O
making O
themselves O
up O
, O
most O
of O
them O
wore O
blue O
casual O
suits O
. O

People O
were O
all O
intent O
to O
build O
up O
our O
motherland O
into O
a O
socialist O
country O
with O
people O
's O
democracy O
and O
freedom O
without O
exploitation O
or O
oppression O
. O

The O
third O
phase O
was O
from O
the O
Sino O
- O
British O
negotiations O
on O
the O
reversion O
of O
Hong O
Kong O
to O
the O
6 O
/ O
4 O
massacre O
in O
'89 O
. O

During O
this O
period O
, O
several O
variables O
occurred O
in O
history O
. O

After O
Mao O
Zedong O
died O
, O
the O
CPC O
rulers O
changed O
their O
policies O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
economy O
, O
reform O
and O
opening O
- O
up O
were O
carried O
out O
, O
and O
the O
participation O
of O
Hong O
Kong O
people O
was O
welcomed O
and O
encouraged O
. O

Hong O
Kong O
people O
were O
no O
longer O
enemies O
and O
running O
dogs O
for O
Britain O
; O
no O
action O
would O
be O
taken O
against O
them O
despite O
their O
previous O
" O
defection O
to O
the O
enemy O
and O
treason O
. O
" O

In O
the O
70s O
, O
Hong O
Kong O
's O
economy O
took O
off O
, O
greatly O
enhancing O
the O
self O
confidence O
of O
Hong O
Kong O
people O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
most O
Hong O
Kong O
people O
were O
skeptical O
about O
the O
reversion O
. O

Those O
who O
had O
the O
means O
fled O
, O
carrying O
money O
with O
them O
. O

Even O
if O
Hong O
Kong O
people O
at O
that O
time O
were O
secretly O
against O
the O
reversion O
, O
they O
dared O
not O
speak O
about O
it O
, O
afraid O
they O
would O
be O
labeled O
as O
sinners O
of O
the O
nation O
. O

Those O
who O
were O
reluctant O
to O
leave O
Hong O
Kong O
, O
were O
impoverished O
, O
or O
were O
unable O
to O
emigrate O
had O
the O
right O
chance O
to O
be O
" O
brave O
Chinese O
people O
" O
for O
once O
. O

Since O
Hong O
Kong O
people O
had O
always O
felt O
a O
sense O
of O
identity O
crisis O
, O
most O
Hong O
Kong O
people O
eventually O
endorsed O
the O
reversion O
after O
recalling O
their O
painful O
experience O
. O

Even O
if O
they O
would O
end O
up O
becoming O
" O
boat O
people O
" O
in O
the O
future O
, O
they O
would O
rather O
China O
did O
not O
lose O
this O
land O
. O

The O
patriotism O
-LRB- O
not O
love O
for O
the O
Communist O
Party O
-RRB- O
of O
Hong O
Kong O
people O
was O
beyond O
any O
doubt O
. O

Moreover O
, O
some O
people O
even O
hoped O
that O
the O
reversion O
of O
Hong O
Kong O
would O
bring O
along O
and O
influence O
the O
development O
of O
the O
mainland O
in O
its O
various O
areas O
including O
politics O
, O
economics O
, O
society O
, O
and O
rule O
of O
law O
. O

Conservative O
people O
sincerely O
hoped O
that O
the O
CPC O
's O
=promise O
of O
" O
No O
Change O
for O
50 O
Years O
" O
was O
real O
. O

Faced O
with O
a O
repeatedly O
delayed O
so O
- O
called O
airborne O
rescue O
operation O
, O
Wen O
Jiabao O
on O
the O
14th O
had O
no O
alternative O
but O
to O
say O
to O
those O
responsible O
, O
" O
I O
'll O
just O
say O
one O
thing O
, O
that O
is O
that O
the O
people O
provide O
you O
with O
a O
living O
. O

Do O
as O
you O
yourselves O
feel O
appropriate O
! O
" O

The O
slogan O
" O
I O
am O
available O
to O
secure O
your O
victory O
in O
any O
adverse O
circumstances O
" O
shouted O
out O
in O
the O
news O
only O
means O
that O
they O
just O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
rain O
to O
stop O
in O
order O
to O
take O
to O
the O
skies O
in O
comfort O
. O

When O
we O
saw O
the O
first O
image O
of O
the O
disaster O
in O
Wenchuan O
on O
the O
television O
screen O
, O
it O
was O
already O
43 O
hours O
after O
the O
earthquake O
happened O
. O

During O
this O
massive O
earthquake O
in O
Wenchuan O
, O
the O
most O
severely O
affected O
Beichuan O
and O
Mianzhu O
were O
almost O
razed O
to O
the O
ground O
, O
and O
countless O
disaster O
victims O
were O
suffering O
distress O
across O
a O
fissure O
300 O
kilometers O
in O
length O
. O

Even O
though O
Wen O
Jiabao O
had O
stressed O
time O
and O
again O
that O
we O
must O
bring O
help O
to O
the O
disaster O
area O
whatever O
the O
cost O
, O
there O
were O
, O
according O
to O
Xinhua O
News O
Agency O
reports O
, O
only O
20 O
- O
plus O
helicopters O
heading O
for O
the O
disaster O
area O
before O
the O
14th O
, O
and O
it O
was O
not O
until O
a O
conference O
at O
the O
anti-quake O
relief O
headquarters O
on O
the O
14th O
that O
they O
decided O
to O
request O
the O
dispatch O
of O
rescue O
workers O
by O
airdrop O
on O
the O
15th O
. O

By O
then O
it O
was O
already O
the O
fourth O
day O
after O
the O
quake O
, O
and O
110 O
helicopters O
set O
off O
. O

Since O
May O
12 O
, O
lists O
of O
" O
top O
donors O
" O
have O
appeared O
on O
all O
major O
domestic O
portals O
. O

The O
amount O
of O
donation O
has O
become O
the O
moral O
scale O
that O
measures O
how O
much O
love O
there O
is O
. O

Quite O
a O
few O
busyboys O
have O
even O
dug O
out O
the O
personal O
property O
and O
privacy O
of O
some O
rich O
people O
who O
are O
considered O
to O
have O
donated O
less O
than O
enough O
, O
to O
reveal O
their O
being O
rich O
but O
cruel O
and O
lack O
of O
love O
to O
repay O
society O
. O

In O
quite O
a O
few O
places O
, O
there O
's O
also O
the O
phenomenon O
of O
intentionally O
seeking O
media O
effects O
of O
the O
donation O
by O
redoing O
it O
before O
a O
video O
camera O
. O

An O
old O
speech O
made O
six O
years O
ago O
by O
Ma O
Yun O
, O
chairman O
of O
the O
Board O
of O
Directors O
of O
the O
commercial O
portal O
Alibaba O
, O
about O
making O
donations O
was O
also O
used O
to O
create O
a O
hype O
, O
resulting O
in O
moral O
condemnation O
by O
online O
opinions O
. O

Just O
as O
donating O
is O
a O
person O
's O
active O
moral O
obligation O
, O
not O
donating O
is O
their O
passive O
legal O
right O
. O

In O
a O
society O
that O
truly O
respects O
human O
dignity O
, O
while O
everyone O
enthusiastically O
makes O
a O
donation O
, O
it O
must O
not O
be O
a O
society O
where O
people O
morally O
try O
, O
put O
before O
the O
public O
and O
sneer O
at O
those O
who O
donate O
nothing O
or O
less O
. O

A O
society O
that O
is O
humane O
and O
full O
of O
love O
must O
also O
be O
a O
tolerant O
society O
. O

In O
a O
tolerant O
society O
, O
we O
should O
say O
" O
thank O
you O
" O
to O
even O
to O
donations O
of O
only O
one O
cent O
. O

Once O
a O
former O
reporter O
of O
official O
CCP O
Central O
News O
Agency O
, O
but O
afterwards O
imprisoned O
twice O
spanning O
seven O
years O
for O
daring O
to O
lift O
the O
lid O
on O
CCP O
corruption O
, O
senior O
journalist O
Gao O
Yu O
described O
the O
CCP O
's O
current O
control O
on O
news O
as O
editing O
its O
content O
like O
a O
movie O
before O
release O
to O
the O
public O
. O

She O
also O
noted O
the O
so O
- O
called O
patriotic O
" O
angry O
youth O
" O
phenomenon O
that O
is O
currently O
shocking O
Western O
society O
reminded O
her O
of O
the O
blind O
arrogance O
during O

Revolution O

Its O
roots O
lie O
in O
the O
CCP O

long O

standing O
blockade O
of O

Gao O
Yu O
said O
, O
" O
it O
's O
like O
the O
kind O
of O
exclusion O
of O
Western O
media O
that O
occurred O
during O
the O
Cultural O
Revolution O
, O
the O
exclusion O
of O
Western O
governments O
in O
circumstances O
where O
we O
were O
so O
poor O
that O
five O
people O
could O
n't O
afford O
one O
pair O
of O
trousers O
but O
still O
behaved O
in O
an O
arrogant O
and O
proud O
fashion O
. O

I O
think O
that O
China O
has O
again O
fallen O
into O
a O
very O
foolish O
, O
a O
-LRB- O
ridiculously O
savage O
-RRB- O
sort O
of O
atmosphere O
; O
approaching O
the O
kind O
of O
political O
status O
displayed O
by O
the O
Nazi O
youth O
league O
in O
Germany O
before O
the O
Berlin O
Olympic O
Games O
. O

How O
could O
this O
have O
come O
about O
? O

How O
can O
our O
China O
have O
such O
an O
astonishing O
large O
amount O
of O
angry O
youth O
? O

I O
think O
it O
is O
closely O
related O
to O
the O
lack O
of O
press O
freedom O
in O
China O
. O
" O

In O
fact O
, O
even O
if O
the O
Department O
of O
Earthquake O
Monitoring O
and O
Predicting O
was O
unable O
to O
accurately O
predict O
an O
impending O
quake O
, O
a O
seismic O
situation O
forecast O
would O
just O
be O
as O
important O
. O

Crying O
wolf O
a O
few O
more O
times O
will O
not O
make O
people O
think O
you O
are O
lying O
. O

On O
the O
contrary O
, O
this O
will O
increase O
people O
's O
earthquake O
awareness O
, O
increase O
the O
ability O
of O
an O
area O
to O
combat O
earthquakes O
. O

It O
's O
better O
to O
be O
safe O
than O
sorry O
. O

The O
Earthquake O
Department O
definitely O
needs O
to O
alter O
this O
" O
rather O
not O
report O
than O
report O
wrong O
" O
kind O
of O

The O
scientific O

During O

in O

no O

could O
be O
found O
to O

and O
this O
is O
just O
a O
small O
error O
? O

And O
those O
school O
buildings O
which O
gave O
way O
at O
the O
very O
outset O
of O

, O
was O
it O
out O
of O
the O
question O
that O
it O
gave O
us O
strong O
enough O
alert O

They O
threw O
away O

The O
kind O
of O

that O
can O
only O
be O
found O
in O
a O
martial O

novel O
is O
currently O
playing O
out O
in O
real O
life O
in O
the O
country O

Earthquake O
Department O

A O
number O
of O
rescue O
teams O
from O
Japan O
, O
Taiwan O
and O
Russia O
, O
among O
others O
, O
made O
the O
request O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
. O

China O
refused O
on O
ground O
that O
there O
was O
no O
access O
. O

Now O
it O
's O
clear O
to O
everybody O
that O
while O
there O
's O
no O
access O
to O
places O
like O
Wenchuan O
, O
areas O
like O
Dujiangyan O
and O
Mianyang O
, O
which O
are O
home O
to O
the O
largest O
number O
of O
disaster O
- O
hit O
people O
, O
have O
easy O
access O
. O

There O
was O
also O
a O
serious O
shortage O
of O
professional O
rescue O
teams O
in O
these O
places O
in O
the O
first O
few O
says O
. O

If O
foreign O
rescue O
teams O
could O
make O
it O
there O
several O
days O
earlier O
, O
hundreds O
of O
lives O
must O
have O
been O
saved O
! O

As O
we O
see O
now O
, O
although O
Wen O
Jiabao O
went O
to O
the O
front O
line O
in O
the O
first O
three O
days O
, O
the O
information O
then O
must O
have O
been O
a O
mess O
, O
such O
that O
a O
wrong O
direction O
was O
selected O
to O
focus O
major O
efforts O
on O
. O

One O
principle O
of O
the O
CPC O
's O
way O
is O
that O
it O
will O
never O
let O
an O
organization O
which O
it O
ca O
n't O
control O
into O
an O
area O
where O
information O
is O
unavailable O
. O

This O
is O
the O
only O
reasonable O
explanation O
of O
the O
CPC O
's O
resolute O
refusal O
at O
that O
time O
. O

Its O
symbolic O
acceptance O
of O
several O
foreign O
rescue O
teams O
later O
was O
a O
helpless O
move O
to O
ease O
the O
pressure O
from O
domestic O
and O
foreign O
public O
opinions O
, O
after O
the O
CPC O
has O
regained O
overall O
control O
of O
the O
situation O
in O
disaster O
- O
hit O
areas O
. O

In O
order O
to O
minimize O
the O
" O
negative O
" O
impacts O
, O
rescue O
locations O
assigned O
to O
foreign O
rescue O
teams O
are O
all O
those O
areas O
that O
have O
already O
been O
searched O

abandoned O

Please O
do O
not O
tell O
me O
you O
know O
both O
China O
and O
the O
West O
. O

I O
know O
many O
of O
you O
are O
very O
ignorant O
about O
China O
and O
have O
a O
deep O
prejudice O
against O
the O
West O
. O

Unlike O
us O
, O
you O
did O
n't O
experience O
the O
hard O
process O
of O
ideological O
emancipation O
in O
China O
, O
rinsing O
out O
bit O
by O
bit O
the O
toxic O
liquid O
infused O
into O
the O
marrow O
in O
the O
Old O
Mao O
era O
and O
crystallizing O
the O
need O
for O
individuality O
emancipation O
, O
freedom O
and O
democracy O
from O
your O
own O

Many O
of O
you O
have O
n't O
even O
rinsed O
off O
the O
brands O
imprinted O
in O
the O
era O
of O
the O
Red O
Guards O

Some O
still O
harbor O
the O
Utopia O

of O
the O
era O
of O
educated O
youth O
, O
with O
uncured O
masochism O
left O
from O
the O
Old O
Mao O
era O
and O
still O
indulging O
in O
your O
memory O
of O
Old O
Mao O
and O
vilification O
of O
Deng O

. O

You O
will O
feel O
uncomfortable O
if O
you O
are O
not O
tortured O
and O
envy O
your O
compatriots O
seeing O
them O
continue O
to O
be O
tortured O
. O

Many O
of O
you O
only O
deal O
with O
Chinese O
and O
kill O
time O
day O
and O
night O
before O
CCTV O
, O
indulging O
in O
rubbish O
Chinese O
soap O
operas O
that O
no O
one O
will O
watch O
even O
in O
China O
. O

I O
doubt O
exactly O
how O
many O
of O
you O
in O
the O
protesting O
crowd O
watched O
CNN O
's O
" O
China O
- O
insulting O
" O
words O
and O
how O
many O
could O
understand O
. O

The O
year O
2008 O
is O
destined O
to O
be O
one O
we O
will O
never O
forget O
. O

Just O
as O
we O
were O
filled O
with O
joyful O
anticipation O
of O
the O
advent O
of O
the O
grand O
Olympic O
Games O
, O
one O
crisis O
event O
after O
another O
is O
rendering O
our O
mood O
more O
complex O
. O

I O
suspect O
no O
nation O
holding O
the O
Olympics O
had O
an O
experience O
like O
ours O
during O
the O
Olympic O
year O
. O

Since O
the O
massive O
earthquake O
occurred O
in O
Wenchuan O
in O
Sichuan O
, O
whenever O
we O
've O
gazed O
at O
the O
disaster O
scenes O
brought O
to O
us O
on O
the O
television O
screen O
, O
we O
could O
n't O
accept O
and O
did O
n't O
dare O
to O
face O
the O
huge O
damage O
done O
to O
our O
nation O
by O
these O
sudden O
disasters O
. O

The O
Chinese O
people O
's O
dauntless O
national O
spirit O
was O
once O
again O
unfolded O
, O
behind O
the O
figure O
of O
the O
premier O
in O
particular O
, O
this O
66 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
premier O
who O
was O
just O
the O
same O
as O
an O
ordinary O
old O
Chinese O
person O
, O
rushing O
about O
the O
disaster O
zones O
. O

How O
often O
, O
as O
we O
felt O
compassion O
for O
the O
loss O
of O
a O
myriad O
lives O
in O
an O
instant O
, O
did O
the O
disaster O
relief O
feats O
by O
all O
walks O
of O
society O
make O
us O
feel O
the O
greatness O
of O
the O
Chinese O
nation O
! O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
we O
also O
saw O
the O
state O
's O
emergency O
response O
and O
the O
transparency O
of O
public O
information O
release O
, O
and O
this O
also O
won O
the O
praise O
and O
respect O
of O
the O
nation O
and O
the O
world O
at O
the O
same O
time O
as O
the O
harm O
caused O
by O
the O
calamity O
was O
being O
mitigated O
. O

The O
resolution O
and O
fearlessness O
displayed O
by O
state O
leaders O
faced O
by O
the O
disaster O
has O
given O
us O
even O
more O
confidence O
and O
courage O
for O
the O
future O
. O

" O
As O
long O
as O
the O

cares O
for O
the O

Not O
long O
ago O
, O
a O
piece O
of O
sensational O
news O
emerged O
. O

The O
US O
Department O
of O
State O
's O
Bureau O
of O
Consular O
Affairs O
released O
a O
directive O
calling O
for O
US O
citizens O
heading O
to O
Beijing O
to O
raise O
their O
guard O
: O

China O
's O
guesthouses O
and O
hotels O
would O
be O
installing O
listening O
devices O
. O

They O
were O
going O
to O
fully O
monitor O
every O
single O
foreign O
guest O
. O

In O
response O
to O
this O
sort O
of O
lie O
, O
China O
politely O
offered O
a O
denial O
. O

At O
times O
, O
Chinese O
people O
can O
show O
surprising O
restraint O
. O

For O
example O
Iceland O
singer O
Bjork O
gave O
a O
concert O
in O
Shanghai O
on O
March O
2 O
, O
and O
while O
performing O
a O
number O
" O
Declare O
Independence O
" O
loudly O
shouted O
out O
" O
Tibet O
" O
; O
China O
continued O
to O
treat O
her O
as O
a O
privileged O
guest O
. O

Actually O
China O
was O
well O
within O
its O
rights O
to O
declare O
that O
Bjork O
with O
this O
act O
crudely O
interfered O
with O
China O
's O
domestic O
politics O
. O

In O
the O
end O
it O
was O
left O
to O
the O
Deputy O
Ministry O
of O
Culture O
to O
step O
up O
and O
make O
a O
few O
relevant O
comments O
. O

Not O
long O
before O
, O
Hollywood O
director O
Spielberg O
openly O
announced O
he O
was O
quitting O
his O
post O
as O
artistic O
advisor O
for O
the O
Olympic O
Games O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
China O
can O
still O
successfully O
hold O
an O
Olympics O
without O
Hollywood O
celebrities O
, O
but O
the O
insult O
and O
damage O
were O
already O
inflicted O
. O

I O
feel O
that O
for O
many O
years O
there O
have O
been O
problems O
with O
the O
work O
orientation O
of O
the O
Earthquake O
Administration O
. O

Many O
experts O
at O
the O
Earthquake O
Administration O
all O
put O
their O
minds O
to O
work O
on O
how O
to O
forecast O
earthquakes O
, O
but O
it O
is O
very O
difficult O
to O
make O
great O
progress O
in O
a O
short O
time O
in O
this O
work O
. O

Therefore O
, O
it O
is O
necessary O
for O
the O
Earthquake O
Administration O
to O
focus O
their O
work O
on O
how O
to O
prepare O
against O
earthquakes O
. O

Japan O
is O
an O
earthquake O
- O
prone O
country O
, O
where O
earthquake O
experts O
do O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
earthquake O
simulation O
and O
modeling O
, O
simulating O
various O
kinds O
of O
circumstances O
when O
earthquakes O
occur O
. O

For O
example O
, O
they O
postulate O
that O
a O
7.0 O
magnitude O
or O
stronger O
earthquake O
occurring O
in O
the O
Tokyo O
city O
center O
will O
result O
in O
derailed O
subways O
, O
with O
tens O
of O
thousands O
of O
people O
trapped O
underground O
, O
while O
the O
large O
embankment O
of O
a O
river O
in O
the O
north O
called O
Arakawa O
will O
collapse O
, O
causing O
water O
to O
flood O
into O
the O
subterraneous O
streets O
. O

When O
this O
sort O
of O
the O
worst O
situation O
occurs O
, O
100,000 O
people O
would O
die O
in O
Tokyo O
. O

There O
are O
many O
similar O
simulations O
, O
and O
many O
cities O
such O
as O
Nagoya O
and O
Osaka O
have O
all O
their O
own O
earthquake O
disaster O
simulations O
and O
have O
made O
contingency O
plans O
against O
earthquakes O
based O
on O
these O
simulations O
. O

Besides O
training O
the O
public O
to O
move O
in O
a O
safe O
direction O
when O
an O
earthquake O
occurs O
, O
they O
also O
make O
the O
government O
strengthen O
the O
large O
embankments O
or O
construct O
dual O
embankments O
, O
to O
prolong O
the O
time O
it O
takes O
for O
the O
great O
quantity O
of O
water O
to O
get O
to O
the O
subway O
tunnels O
. O

In O
addition O
they O
also O
conduct O
experiments O
on O
all O
kinds O
of O
housing O
structures O
, O

The O
directions O

prevention O
and O

minimization O
are O
just O
confined O
to O
research O
into O

" O
Nonfood O
inflation O
is O
certain O
to O
go O
higher O
, O
and O
is O
already O
creeping O
up O
, O
" O
said O
Sun O
Mingchun O
, O
an O
economist O
for O
Lehman O
Brothers O
in O
Hong O
Kong O
. O

He O
believes O
that O
if O
food O
prices O
go O
down O
, O
but O
nonfood O
inflation O
goes O
up O
, O
economically O
it O
's O
a O
big O
problem O
. O

According O
to O
statistics O
of O
the O
National O
Bureau O
of O
Statistics O
, O
China O
's O
consumer O
- O
price O
index O
-LRB- O
CPI O
-RRB- O
excluding O
food O
prices O
increased O
by O
1.8 O
% O
in O
March O
, O
while O
it O
hovered O
at O
1 O
% O
or O
less O
for O
most O
of O
2006 O
and O
2007 O
. O

The O
accelerated O
rise O
of O
the O
indicator O
likely O
shows O
that O
higher O
wages O
and O
raw O
- O
material O
costs O
are O
being O
reflected O
in O
a O
broader O
range O
of O
goods O
, O
a O
phenomenon O
that O
will O
impact O
the O
global O
market O
given O
China O
's O
importance O
as O
a O
global O
supplier O
of O
many O
products O
. O

Another O
factor O
that O
drives O
inflation O
up O
is O
: O
higher O
rents O
due O
to O
continued O
housing O
price O
rises O
in O
most O
cities O
. O

J.P. O
Morgan O
economists O
expect O
nonfood O
inflation O
to O
continue O
to O
speed O
up O
to O
an O
average O
2.5 O
% O
for O
all O
of O

After O

We O

Some O

but O
we O
have O

The O
disastrous O
snow O
storms O
had O
just O
passed O
when O
rioting O
and O
violence O
broke O
out O
in O
Lhasa O
again O
. O

Now O
a O
powerful O
earthquake O
has O
struck O
in O
Sichuan O
's O
Wenchuan O
, O
this O
misfortune O
- O
plagued O
homeland O
of O
mine O
. O

The O
earthquake O
disaster O
neatly O
coincided O
with O
the O
Olympic O
torch O
relay O
within O
China O
. O

The O
attack O
of O
the O
quake O
for O
a O
time O
stripped O
away O
the O
luster O
from O
the O
Olympic O
torch O
relay O
, O
and O
it O
lost O
its O
significance O
. O

The O
torch O
relay O
is O
a O
kind O
of O
symbol O
, O
it O
symbolizes O
luck O
, O
peace O
, O
unity O
, O
and O
spirit O
; O
it O
arouses O
the O
nationalistic O
passion O
of O
the O
people O
, O
awakens O
the O
people O
's O
patriotic O
zeal O
. O

The O
transfer O
of O
the O
Olympic O
torch O
clearly O
brings O
with O
it O
a O
kind O
of O
intense O
rejoicing O
and O
an O
atmosphere O
of O
warmth O
. O

But O
all O
this O
has O
dissipated O
because O
of O
the O
quake O
, O
disappearing O
without O
a O
trace O
. O

Can O
the O
torch O
still O
continue O
to O
be O
passed O
on O
the O
same O
way O
it O
was O
in O
the O
past O
? O

I O
'm O
afraid O
it O
can O
not O
. O

Continuing O
the O
relay O
will O
in O
the O
first O
case O
chill O
the O
hearts O
of O
the O
people O
in O
the O
quake O
zone O
, O
and O
then O
serve O
to O
chill O
the O
hearts O
of O
every O
citizen O
in O
the O
country O
. O

Because O
of O
this O
, O
putting O
an O
end O
to O
the O
torch O
relay O
is O
a O
very O
necessary O
action O
. O

When O
compared O
with O
earthquake O
relief O
, O
with O
the O
suffering O
of O
people O
in O
the O
disaster O
zone O
, O
the O
Olympic O
torch O
relay O
is O
not O
worth O
talking O
about O
. O

What O
China O
needs O
now O
is O
all O
the O
people O
with O
one O
mind O
working O
hand O
in O
hand O
for O
the O
rescue O
effort O
. O

Web O
site O
promotion O
became O
much O
more O
complex O
and O
arduous O
. O

From O
exchanging O
links O
, O
logging O
on O
to O
search O
engines O
and O
information O
release O
to O
mailing O
lists O
, O
maintenance O
and O
transmission O
, O
every O
aspect O
involves O
professional O
knowledge O
. O

It O
is O
already O
not O
a O
case O
of O
just O
simply O
studying O
a O
few O
techniques O
such O
as O
Web O
page O
construction O
being O
able O
to O
solve O
the O
problem O
. O

But O
this O
part O
is O
critically O
important O
. O

Because O
of O
this O
, O
I O
have O
the O
following O
advice O
for O
Web O
site O
promotion O
in O
small O
to O
medium O
sized O
businesses O
. O

Outsource O
key O
projects O
, O
undertaking O
other O
promotional O
work O
in O
- O
house O
. O

Key O
projects O
primarily O
refer O
to O
search O
engine O
promotion O
, O
and O
Internet O
advertising O
. O

China O
's O
domestic O
search O
engine O
and O
Internet O
advertising O
providers O
are O
all O
pushing O
agent O
- O
based O
systems O
. O

Their O
authorized O
agents O
in O
any O
region O
can O
be O
found O
on O
the O
Web O
site O
. O

Sometimes O
the O
price O
when O
going O
through O
agents O
is O
even O
cheaper O
than O
the O
price O
quoted O
by O
media O
Web O
sites O
themselves O
. O

But O
if O
your O
company O
does O
n't O
have O
that O
kind O
of O
budget O
, O
you O
can O
only O
log O
in O
for O
free O
on O
Google O
. O

It O
's O
just O
that O
ordinarily O
, O
Web O
site O
planning O
and O
design O
staff O
during O
Web O
site O
construction O
will O
by O
no O
means O
only O
consider O
the O
Web O
page O
optimization O
issue O
of O
Google O
ranking O
, O
so O
in O
actual O
fact O
if O
you O
want O
to O
get O
a O
good O
ranking O
, O
it O
is O
actually O
pretty O
difficult O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
carry O
out O
search O
engine O
optimization O
, O
on O
the O
one O
hand O
it O
is O
going O
to O
involve O
expense O
, O
but O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
is O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
optimization O
. O

From O
the O
conditions O
we O
see O
at O
present O
, O
the O
intensity O
at O
the O
epicenter O
possibly O
exceeded O
reinforcement O
standards O
. O

But O
the O
building O
grade O
for O
such O
types O
of O
public O
buildings O
as O
schools O
and O
hospitals O
ought O
to O
be O
above O
a O
grade O
B O
, O
and O
absolutely O
not O
below O
grade O
C O
. O

If O
construction O
had O
been O
strictly O
carried O
out O
according O
to O
reinforcement O
specifications O
, O
such O
serious O
widespread O
collapsing O
should O
not O
have O
occurred O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
right O
next O
to O
the O
collapsed O
school O
buildings O
were O
buildings O
that O
did O
not O
collapse O
. O

Therefore O
, O
emergency O
assessment O
needs O
to O
be O
carried O
out O
on O
these O
collapsed O
school O
buildings O
, O
hospitals O
and O
other O
public O
buildings O
; O
design O
plans O
, O
components O
, O
concrete O
, O
steel O
reinforcements O
, O
bricks O
etc O
should O
be O
sampled O
and O
notarized O
, O
in O
preparation O
for O
inspection O
and O
appraisal O
. O

If O
it O
is O
found O
that O
some O
aspects O
of O
design O
did O
not O
comply O
with O
mandatory O
national O
standards O
, O
or O
that O
shoddy O
materials O
were O
used O
, O
inferior O
quality O
, O
or O
any O
of O
these O
circumstances O
, O
then O
the O
legal O
responsibilities O
of O
the O
authorities O
and O
people O
involved O
should O
be O
looked O
into O
. O

Only O
this O
way O
can O
we O
lay O
to O
rest O
the O
ghosts O
of O
the O
students O
killed O
in O
the O
disaster O
, O
can O
we O
account O
to O
the O
parents O
of O
the O
victims O
, O
can O
we O
obtain O
justice O
for O
the O
community O
, O
can O
we O
warn O
later O
generations O
of O
the O
lessons O
to O
be O
learned O
. O

Departments O
in O
charge O
need O
to O
take O
the O
initiative O
in O
undertaking O
these O
tasks O
. O

Victims O
and O
the O
public O
can O
also O
help O
, O
remembering O
that O
samples O
must O
undergo O
notarization O
by O
a O
notary O
office O
before O
they O
can O
have O
legal O
validity O
. O

It O
is O
said O
that O
our O
country O
's O
earthquake O
forecasting O
is O
at O
an O
advanced O
level O
in O
the O
world O
. O

But O
the O
glory O
of O
the O
earthquake O
workers O
did O
not O
produce O
good O
luck O
for O
the O
departed O
spirits O
of O
Wenchuan O
. O

So O
, O
we O
again O
hear O
expert O
figures O
emphasizing O
once O
again O
, O
" O
Earthquake O
forecasts O
are O
a O
global O
challenge O
that O
so O
far O
no O
one O
has O
been O
able O
to O
solve O
. O
" O

We O
should O
offer O
earthquake O
workers O
our O
full O
understanding O
. O

Facing O
the O
caprice O
of O
nature O
, O
humankind O
is O
really O
insignificant O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
although O
our O
sense O
of O
security O
increases O
with O
each O
passing O
day O
in O
line O
with O
" O
significant O
advances O
achieved O
" O
in O
seismology O
, O
we O
can O
not O
look O
to O
anyone O
to O
give O
us O
any O
promises O
. O
Because O
, O
once O
someone O
has O
made O
a O
promise O
, O
he O
would O
be O
doomed O
thereafter O
to O
bear O
this O
bloody O
weight O
of O
" O
being O
unable O
to O
effectively O
avoid O
earthquake O
disasters O
. O
" O

And O
by O
not O
issuing O
any O
promises O
, O
he O
could O
actually O
avoid O
being O
censured O
. O
Because O
" O
there O
is O
no O
way O
to O
make O
predictions O
" O
! O

In O
the O
first O
case O
, O
let O
's O
clear O
up O
an O
extremely O
retarded O
error O
in O
understanding O
- O
that O
is O
the O
belief O
that O
helicopters O
can O
do O
anything O
, O
can O
fly O
anytime O
they O
like O
, O
go O
to O
anyplace O
- O
this O
is O
Hollywood O
blockbusters O
, O
this O
is O
not O
fact O
. O

Actually O
, O
helicopters O
are O
the O
weakest O
type O
of O
aircraft O
in O
the O
world O
. O

They O
ca O
n't O
fly O
on O
the O
plateau O
, O
ca O
n't O
fly O
in O
mountainous O
areas O
, O
ca O
n't O
fly O
in O
rain O
and O
wind O
: O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
they O
are O
most O
useful O
in O
places O
like O
Iraq O
. O

But O
when O
it O
came O
to O
attacking O
the O
Southern O
Alliance O
, O
the O
US O
Apache O
helicopter O
squadron O
lost O
4 O
aircraft O
for O
no O
apparent O
reason O
while O
changing O
bases O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
day O
. O

During O
the O
entire O
period O
of O
the O
Kosovo O
war O
-LRB- O
Kosovo O
being O
a O
mountainous O
region O
-RRB- O
, O
America O
's O
armed O
helicopters O
did O
not O
execute O
a O
single O
effective O
combat O
mission O
. O

Why O
? O

Because O
they O
were O
totally O
unable O
to O
take O
off O
, O
the O
wind O
in O
the O
valleys O
was O
lethal O
to O
helicopters O
- O
the O
minute O
they O
took O
off O
they O
were O
blown O
into O
the O
mountains O
. O

In O
that O
case O
, O
is O
it O
OK O
not O
to O
fly O
in O
the O
valleys O
, O
just O
fly O
above O
the O
mountain O
tops O
then O
? O

Normally O
it O
's O
possible O
, O
but O
in O
this O
particular O
earthquake O
it O
is O
n't O
possible O
. O

Because O
Wenchuan O
County O
is O
in O
a O
valley O
, O
you O
must O
descend O
in O
order O
to O
be O
able O
to O
conduct O
a O
rescue O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
for O
Wenchuan O
, O
this O
sort O
of O
place O
lying O
on O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
plateau O
, O
ordinary O
helicopters O
can O
not O
necessarily O
fly O
up O
there O
. O

A O
helicopter O
used O
specifically O
for O
plateaus O
may O
be O
required O
. O

As O
time O
goes O
by O
, O
rescue O
forces O
are O
rapidly O
expanding O
, O

disaster O

and O
major O

Speaking O
of O
Chinese O
traitors O
, O
it O
has O
always O
been O
a O
concept O
taken O
seriously O
by O
our O
countrymen O
in O
traditional O
Chinese O
culture O
. O

Our O
countrymen O
=bitterly O
hate O
Chinese O
traitors O
. O

But O
since O
the O
reform O
and O
opening O
- O
up O
, O
with O
the O
worship O
of O
everything O
foreign O
becoming O
fashionable O
, O
this O
concept O
has O
been O
continuously O
challenged O
. O

Therefore O
, O
in O
order O
to O
deepen O
our O
understanding O
of O
what O
Chinese O
traitors O
and O
their O
harm O
are O
, O
enhance O
our O
concept O
of O
nationality O
, O
and O
take O
action O
to O
resolutely O
combat O
treason O
, O
it O
is O
extremely O
necessary O
to O
analyze O
the O
differences O
and O
similarities O
between O
the O
ancient O
and O
modern O
Chinese O
traitors O
. O

Chinese O
traitors O
, O
as O
the O
name O
implies O
, O
are O
something O
after O
the O
two O
Han O
Dynasties O
in O
Chinese O
history O
. O

But O
the O
concepts O
of O
patriotism O
and O
treason O
appeared O
as O
early O
as O
in O
the O
Spring O
and O
Autumn O
and O
Warring O
States O
period O
. O

The O
characteristics O
of O
the O
states O
in O
that O
period O
and O
those O
of O
the O
states O
after O
that O
greatly O
changed O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
traitors O
who O
were O
intellectuals O
such O
as O
Su O
Qin O
and O
Zhang O
Yi O
were O
as O
numerous O
as O
could O
be O
and O
almost O
became O
fashionable O
, O
but O
in O
the O
end O
, O
as O
most O
of O
them O
sold O
themselves O
to O
the O
Qin O
state O
, O
and O
later O
, O
because O
" O
the O
Qin O
emperor O
swept O
across O
the O
world O
, O
with O
a O
majestic O
glare O
of O
a O
tiger O
, O
" O
and O
China O
was O
reunited O
, O
no O
one O
brought O
it O
up O
any O
more O
. O

As O
for O
patriots O
, O
people O
only O
remember O
one O
person O
, O
Qu O
Yuan O
. O
Because O
Qu O
Yuan O
wrote O
excellent O
poetry O
, O
and O
there O
is O
the O
Dragon O
- O
Boat O
Festival O
, O
his O
story O
has O
been O
passed O
down O
till O
now O
. O

Well O
- O
known O
traitors O
in O
China O
like O
Qin O
Kuai O
, O
Zhang O
Bangchang O
, O
Wang O
Jingwei O
, O
and O
the O
like O
were O
universally O
condemned O
, O
which O
actually O
happened O
later O
on O
. O

Li O
Kaifu O

, O
Google O
's O
future O
lies O
in O
*integrated O
search* O
-LRB- O
or O
universal O
search O
-RRB- O
. O

My O
understanding O
of O
integrated O
search O
is O
that O
search O
results O
by O
other O
products O
are O
included O
in O
web O
search O
- O
the O
most O
important O
product O
of O
a O
search O
engine O
, O
because O
normally O
web O
search O
has O
the O
largest O
number O
of O
users O
. O

This O
way O
, O
users O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
compare O
and O
choose O
from O
a O
large O
variety O
of O
search O
products O
today O
. O

Integrated O
search O
also O
embodies O
the O
trend O
to O
make O
search O
engines O
intelligent O
. O

As O
search O
result O
integration O
is O
based O
on O
analyzing O
and O
judging O
the O
function O
of O
key O
words O
, O
if O
a O
user O
types O
the O
key O
word O
" O
scenery O
" O
in O
Google O
, O
Google O
's O
understanding O
is O
that O
the O
user O
wants O
to O
find O
images O
about O
" O

, O
" O
rather O
than O
an O

Thus O
by O
adding O

, O
it O
has O
realized O
intelligent O

. O

After O
Lee O
Teng O
- O
hui O
put O
forth O
the O
" O
two O

theory O
" O
, O
due O
to O
mainland O
countrymen O
being O
deceived O
by O
the O
CCP O
's O
propaganda O
machine O
, O
many O
people O
advocated O
using O
force O
to O
unite O
Taiwan O
. O

Because O
they O
have O
no O
understanding O
whatsoever O
of O
the O
situation O
in O
Taiwan O
and O
the O
will O
of O
the O
Taiwan O
people O
, O
they O
universally O
exhibited O
extreme O
nationalistic O
sentiment O
. O

Just O
like O
the O
love O
- O
hate O
fusion O
of O
nationalistic O
war O
sentiment O
that O
erupted O
after O
the O
US O
mistakenly O
bombed O
the O
Chinese O
embassy O
. O

They O
similarly O
did O
not O
understand O
the O
real O
story O
in O
Kosovo O
. O

But O
Hong O
Kong O
people O
realize O
that O
first O
there O
was O
the O
Republic O
of O
China O
, O
only O
after O
that O
came O
" O
New O
China O
" O
; O
While O
this O
" O
Two O
States O
Separatist O
Theory O
" O
has O
purely O
and O
simply O
been O
dreamed O
up O
by O
the O
CCP O
. O

Lee O
Teng O
- O
hui O
was O
doing O
nothing O
but O
bringing O
an O
already O
existing O
phenomenon O
to O
light O
. O

Moreover O
, O
the O
grand O
old O
men O
of O
the O
CCP O
who O
handed O
over O
on O
a O
silver O
platter O
a O
huge O
chunk O
of O
land O
in O
Manchuria O
north O
of O
the O
Amur O

, O
who O
gave O
away O
land O
equivalent O
to O
ten O
percent O
of O
national O
territory O
in O
northern O

; O
why O
not O
take O
this O
back O
, O
instead O
of O
insisting O
on O
trying O
to O
grab O
back O
a O
Taiwan O
that O

in O
the O
hands O
of O
Chinese O
people O

However O
, O
even O
though O
Hong O

people O
have O
their O
grumbles O
, O
the O
" O
two O

theory O
" O
has O
in O
no O
way O
triggered O
a O
sentimental O
attachment O
in O
Hong O

for O

Old O

" O

Wang O
Shi O
's O
experience O
of O
being O
under O
public O
condemnation O
underscored O
to O
a O
certain O
extent O
the O
tense O
relationship O
between O
the O
rich O
and O
poor O
classes O
in O
Chinese O
society O
; O
because O
as O
China O
grows O
prosperous O
day O
by O
day O
, O
the O
gap O
of O
wealth O
between O
the O
successful O
elite O
and O
the O
remaining O
1.3 O
billion O
people O
is O
widening O
. O

Thirty O
years O
ago O
, O
people O
had O
basically O
the O
same O
incomes O
, O
which O
were O
all O
deplorably O
meager O
. O

However O
, O
Hurun O
Report O

Hurun O

shows O
that O
by O

Now O
, O
Wang O
Shi O
said O
, O
these O
responses O
have O
had O
effects O
on O

He O
admitted O
that O
he O
was O
not O
sensitive O
enough O
to O
the O
current O
situation O
when O
he O
wrote O
his O

Wang O

noted O

that O
since O
China O
currently O
has O
not O
yet O
established O
a O
sound O
system O
of O

, O
the O

On O

that O
it O

a O
national O

thanks O
to O
his O
success O

, O
was O
also O
blamed O
after O
he O
announced O
his O
donation O
of O
RMB O
two O
million O

because O
a O
rumor O
on O

At O
14:28 O
on O
May O
12 O
, O
2008 O
, O
there O
was O
a O
massive O
earthquake O
with O
a O
magnitude O
of O
7.8 O
in O
the O
Wenchuan O
area O
of O
Sichuan O
province O
. O

From O
that O
point O
on O
, O
an O
impressive O
earthquake O
relief O
effort O
with O
the O
active O
participation O
of O
the O
whole O
party O
, O
the O
whole O
army O
and O
the O
whole O
nation O
and O
people O
began O
on O
the O
Chinese O
mainland O
! O

It O
was O
not O
spontaneous O
; O
it O
was O
an O
organized O
, O
orderly O
, O
and O
large O
- O
scale O
mass O
earthquake O
relief O
effort O
under O
the O
leadership O
of O
party O
organizations O
and O
governments O
at O
all O
levels O
. O

In O
the O
immense O
ranks O
of O
the O
earthquake O
relief O
effort O
, O
Communist O
Party O
cadres O
and O
government O
officials O
of O
all O
levels O
assumed O
the O
directing O
and O
organizing O
positions O
, O
and O
our O
people O
's O
army O
charged O
in O
the O
forefront O
. O

The O
emergency O
relief O
and O
rescue O
brigades O
sent O
from O
all O
parts O
of O
the O
country O
, O
the O
medical O
corps O
, O
the O
anti-epidemic O
corps O
, O
the O
goods O
transportation O
contingent O
and O
also O
the O
volunteers O
followed O
closely O
behind O
, O
heading O
for O
the O
disaster O
zone O
. O

Airplanes O
roared O
; O
vehicle O
wheels O
rumbled O
; O
and O
there O
were O
also O
the O
formidable O
ranks O
on O
foot O
, O
charging O
full O
steam O
ahead O
like O
the O
roll O
of O
an O
ocean O
wave O
, O
as O
the O
heroic O
and O
stirring O
act O
unfolded O
on O
the O
Chinese O
mainland O
! O

The O
earthquake O
was O
a O
lesson O
, O
a O
mirror O
, O
and O
a O
great O
practical O
test O
of O
truth O
! O

A O
suggestion O
to O
the O
Chinese O
government O
, O
that O
is O
more O
precautions O
are O
now O
needed O
instead O
in O
earthquake O
- O
prone O
areas O
where O
earthquakes O
have O
n't O
occurred O
. O

There O
should O
be O
an O
appropriate O
policy O
for O
buildings O
in O
these O
areas O
. O

My O
opinion O
seems O
to O
be O
so O
long O
as O
a O
city O
is O
not O
in O
the O
epicenter O
, O
if O
a O
building O
is O
extremely O
sturdy O
, O
then O
it O
would O
be O
able O
to O
stand O
the O
earthquake O
without O
collapsing O
. O

Regarding O
this O
, O
I O
think O
buildings O
in O
Taiwan O
Province O
are O
also O
worth O
learning O
from O
. O

As O
I O
remember O
, O
when O
an O
earthquake O
struck O
Taiwan O
Province O
, O
I O
noticed O
on O
TV O
that O
while O
many O
residential O
buildings O
were O
already O
tilted O
, O
they O
just O
did O
not O
collapse O
, O
which O
created O
opportunities O
for O
people O
to O
survive O
. O

If O
seems O
a O
concrete O
- O
structured O
building O
is O
comparatively O
sturdy O
, O
since O
it O
's O
a O
whole O
. O

For O
some O
buildings O
that O
collapsed O
in O
this O
earthquake O
, O
such O
as O
collapsed O
school O
buildings O
that O
buried O
students O
underneath O
, O
if O
there O
are O
any O
quality O
problems O
with O
the O
construction O
, O
the O
builders O
should O
be O
held O
accountable O
. O

I O
remember O
during O
the O
Turkish O
earthquake O
last O
time O
, O
many O
real O
estate O
developers O
that O
made O
shoddy O
buildings O
were O
held O
accountable O
. O

People O
have O
also O
criticized O
Walmart O
online O
for O
displaying O
favoritism O
, O
contributing O
just O
3 O
million O
RMB O
-LRB- O
equivalent O
to O
430,700 O
U.S. O
dollars O
-RRB- O
to O
the O
earthquake O
relief O
, O
while O
donating O
2 O
million O
U.S. O
dollars O
for O
Hurricane O
Katrina O
. O

A O
spokesman O
for O
the O
company O
said O
that O
cash O
donation O
was O
just O
one O
part O
of O
a O
larger O
scale O
disaster O
relief O
effort O
of O
the O
company O
, O
and O
that O
Walmart O
had O
also O
made O
use O
of O
its O
professional O
experience O
in O
supply O
and O
logistics O
to O
provide O
assistance O
for O
disaster O
relief O
. O

The O
spokesman O
pointed O
out O
that O
Walmart O
's O
work O
in O
combating O
disasters O
should O
not O
be O
evaluated O
solely O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
amount O
of O
cash O
. O

China O
's O
Minister O
of O
Commerce O
Chen O
Deming O
on O
Thursday O
expressed O
gratitude O
for O
the O
support O
provided O
for O
earthquake O
relief O
by O
foreign O
- O
owned O
enterprises O
. O

At O
a O
press O
conference O
, O
he O
said O
that O
foreign O
- O
owned O
enterprises O
had O
contributed O
a O
total O
of O
1.95 O
billion O
RMB O
in O
donations O
. O

State O

Agency O
, O

provided O
by O
the O
State O
Council O
Information O
Office O
-LRB- O
the O
State O
Council O
Information O
Office O
-RRB- O
, O
reported O
that O
as O
of O
Thursday O
, O
domestic O
and O
international O
donations O
had O
reached O
21.4 O
billion O
RMB O
-LRB- O
approximately O
3 O
billion O
U.S. O
dollars O
-RRB- O
. O

I O
think O
that O
if O
our O
Earthquake O
Administration O
had O
been O
able O
beforehand O
to O
do O
a O
simulation O
of O
big O
earthquakes O
on O
this O
Longmenshan O
mountain O
earthquake O
belt O
, O
then O
on O
that O
day O
of O
May O
12 O
, O
once O
the O
Earthquake O
Administration O
had O
measured O
the O
quake O
at O
a O
magnitude O
of O
7.8 O
, O
we O
would O
have O
been O
able O
to O
broadly O
judge O
the O
extent O
of O
damage O
and O
destruction O
in O
the O
earthquake O
disaster O
zone O
. O

If O
the O
simulation O
program O
was O
well O
designed O
, O
circumstances O
like O
debris O
blocking O
roads O
, O
heavy O
rainfall O
obstructing O
parachute O
drops O
, O
power O
and O
communication O
outages O
should O
all O
have O
been O
within O
expectations O
. O

Instead O
in O
this O
instance O
the O
Liberation O
Army O
headquarters O
emergency O
contingency O
plan O
obviously O
was O
not O
a O
contingency O
plan O
designed O
with O
earthquakes O
as O
the O
assumed O
condition O
, O
as O
the O
soldiers O
all O
rushed O
straight O
to O
Wenchuan O
, O
without O
immediately O
sending O
out O
troops O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
badly O
- O
hit O
areas O
Beichuan O
, O
Qingchuan O
and O
Gansu's O
Longnan O
; O
only O
24 O
hours O
later O
was O
the O
full O
extent O
of O
the O
disaster O
area O
taken O
into O
consideration O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
breakdown O
in O
communication O
also O
brought O
a O
serious O
problem O
to O
the O
surface O
. O

In O
the O
past O
, O
Red O
Army O
regiments O
were O
able O
to O
maintain O
contact O
with O
central O
headquarters O
by O
relying O
on O
just O
one O
battered O
radio O
. O

On O
this O
occasion O
though O
, O
people O
had O
no O
way O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
communication O
failure O
. O

It O
is O
clear O
that O
preparations O
prior O
to O
the O
event O
were O
not O
constructed O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
an O
earthquake O
disaster O
simulation O
. O

After O
the O
May O
12th O
Sichuan O
Earthquake O
, O
overseas O
Chinese O
throughout O
the O
world O
watched O
the O
news O
each O
day O
with O
tears O
in O
their O
eyes O
. O

However O
, O
people O
discovered O
very O
quickly O
that O
Wenchuan O
is O
anxiously O
waiting O
. O

The O
rescue O
process O
seemed O
sluggish O
, O
the O
tears O
of O
the O
Premier O
failing O
to O
move O
the O
officials O
in O
charge O
. O

Possibly O
it O
was O
a O
fault O
in O
the O
rescue O
contingency O
plan O
, O
in O
that O
42 O
hours O
after O
the O
earthquake O
struck O
, O
rescue O
workers O
entering O
the O
devastated O
area O
of O
Wenchuan O
County O
were O
forced O
to O
proceed O
on O
foot O
for O
more O
than O
20 O
hours O
, O
at O
that O
time O
an O
already O
exhausted O
and O
poorly O
equipped O
team O
of O
only O
a O
thousand O
or O
so O
. O

When O
the O
" O
golden O
72 O
hours O
" O
the O
elite O
considered O
had O
arrived O
, O
within O
24 O
hours O
the O
more O
than O
a O
hundred O
thousand O
victims O
trapped O
in O
the O
rubble O
barely O
able O
to O
breathe O
looked O
to O
just O
ten O
thousand O
- O
odd O
, O
empty O
- O
handed O
rescue O
workers O
. O

From O
rescue O
attempts O
at O
the O
scene O
, O
it O
could O
easily O
be O
seen O
that O
to O
save O
one O
person O
from O
the O
rubble O
required O
the O
concerted O
efforts O
of O
at O
least O
3 O
to O
5 O
people O
striving O
manfully O
for O
several O
to O
dozens O
of O
hours O
in O
order O
to O
achieve O
a O
successful O
rescue O
. O

There O
were O
more O
than O
20 O
million O
people O
afflicted O
in O
Sichuan O
this O
time O
, O
affecting O
an O
area O
of O
one O
- O
hundred O
thousand O
square O
kilometers O
; O
in O
the O
58 O
cities O
and O
towns O
in O
the O
most O
badly O
- O
hit O
area O
near O
the O
epicenter O
, O
at O
least O
a O
hundred O
thousand O
people O
were O
buried O
in O
the O
rubble O
, O
which O
is O
to O
say O
, O
at O
the O
very O
least O
, O
a O
rescue O
force O
of O
more O
than O
300 O
thousand O
needed O
to O
be O
dispatched O
. O

On O
the O
same O
day O
around O
9 O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
the O
morning O
market O
held O
in O
the O
square O
in O
front O
of O
the O
city O
hall O
went O
ahead O
as O
usual O
. O

If O
not O
for O
the O
" O
Media O
Please O
Enter O
" O
sign O
, O
perhaps O
nobody O
could O
tell O
that O
an O
important O
activity O
would O
take O
place O
here O
. O

Passing O
through O
the O
maze O
- O
like O
corridors O
of O
the O
city O
hall O
, O
security O
personnel O
carefully O
inspected O
the O
clothing O
of O
reporters O
, O
even O
taking O
an O
on O
- O
the O
- O
spot O
photo O
with O
their O
cameras O
before O
letting O
them O
through O
. O

At O
approximately O
9:30 O
the O
Dalai O
, O
with O
a O
retinue O
including O
the O
Mayor O
of O
Bochum O
, O
attendants O
and O
at O
least O
six O
bodyguards O
entered O
the O
hall O
. O

He O
pulled O
out O
his O
trademark O
smile O
, O
repeatedly O
placing O
his O
palms O
together O
, O
pausing O
now O
and O
then O
to O
shake O
hands O
and O
embrace O
with O
journalists O
lining O
the O
corridors O
. O

After O
shaking O
hands O
with O
a O
German O
reporter O
next O
to O
China O
's O
International O
Herald O
Leader O
journalist O
, O
he O
suddenly O
looked O
back O
to O
discover O
an O
Asian O
face O
. O

The O
Dalai O
walked O
back O
again O
to O
shake O
hands O
, O
and O
patted O
the O
journalist O
on O
the O
shoulder O
, O
saying O
in O
Chinese O
" O
Hello O
! O
Hello O
! O
" O

Following O
the O
commencement O
of O
the O
press O
conference O
, O
the O
Dalai O
expressed O
his O
gratitude O
to O
the O
host O
for O
his O
invitation O
and O
organizing O
work O
, O
all O
the O
while O
with O
his O
palms O
placed O
together O
, O
smiling O
fatuously O
from O
time O
to O
time O
. O

It O
is O
exactly O
these O
childish O
fun O
- O
like O
poses O
that O
he O
relies O
on O
to O
impress O
Europeans O
, O
and O
this O
day O
was O
no O
exception O
, O
with O
" O
knowing O
laughter O
" O
from O
the O
foreign O
journalists O
at O
frequent O
intervals O
. O

However O
, O
the O
Dalai O
made O
not O
the O
slightest O
mention O
of O
the O
Sichuan O
earthquake O
that O
had O
only O
just O
struck O
, O
at O
that O
time O
the O
life O
and O
death O
of O
nationals O
including O
many O
fellow O
Tibetan O
countrymen O
caught O
in O
the O
earthquake O
were O
still O
unknown O
. O

" O
Amid O
tears O
, O
conscience O
has O
come O
back O
; O

on O
ruins O
, O
humanity O
has O
stood O
firm O
. O

The O
great O
earthquake O
has O
shaken O
off O
the O
dusts O
on O
our O
mind O
, O
and O
has O
shattered O
our O
everyday O
masks O
. O
" O

People O
's O
spirits O
exuded O
in O
the O
disaster O
relief O
effort O
are O
apparently O
the O
comeback O
of O
selfless O
collectivism O
, O
rather O
than O
what O
is O
called O
the O
" O
comeback O
of O
conscience O
" O
or O
the O
" O
awakening O
and O
growth O
of O
civil O
consciousness O
. O
" O

What O
stand O
firm O
are O
the O
solidarity O
of O
people O
under O
the O
Party O
's O
leadership O
, O
as O
well O
as O
collectivism O
and O
patriotism O
, O
and O
what O
has O
fallen O
is O
instead O
" O
selfish O
humanity O
. O
" O

It O
's O
not O
even O
the O
empty O
" O
humanity O
of O
love O
. O
" O

How O
can O
it O
be O
explained O
with O
the O
" O
humanity O
of O
love O
" O
that O
many O
ordinary O
heroes O
have O
given O
up O
their O
love O
for O
families O
and O
carried O
forward O
the O
proletarian O
spirits O
of O
selflessness O
, O
interdependent O
friendship O
and O
total O
devotion O
. O

It O
can O
be O
seen O
from O
" O
humanity O
has O
stood O
firm O
, O
" O
which O
is O
eulogized O
in O
the O
article O
, O
that O
it O
advocates O
unrestrained O
humanity O
, O
as O
well O
as O
slandering O
all O
nobility O
as O
" O
everyday O
masks O
" O
and O
" O
dusts O
on O
our O
mind O
. O
" O

However O
, O
does O
n't O
the O
disaster O
relief O
effort O
mark O
the O
reawakening O
of O
the O
noble O
spirits O
rather O
than O
fully O
unrestrained O
humanity O
? O

The O
elite O
are O
in O
the O
majority O
, O
and O
there O
is O
the O
mainstream O
media O
as O
well O
-- O
they O
do O
not O
mention O
or O
seldom O
mention O
the O
socialist O
spirit O
and O
thought O
. O

An O
argument O
is O
also O
unavoidable O
. O

There O
is O
one O
thing O
in O
common O
. O

Let O
me O
say O
it O
once O
again O
: O
everyone O
focuses O
on O
the O
spiritual O
aspect O
, O
political O
aspect O
and O
ideological O
aspect O
; O
follow O
what O
is O
happening O
and O
focus O
! O

This O
point O
has O
particular O
significance O
in O
a O
period O
focused O
on O
the O
economy O
. O

We O
should O
realize O
what O
factors O
influence O
the O
earthquake O
relief O
; O
this O
point O
is O
extremely O
important O
! O

The O
recognition O
of O
this O
point O
began O
with O
the O
fight O
against O
flood O
in O
'98 O
and O
the O
battle O
against O
SARS O
in O
'03 O
. O

Today O
we O
should O
have O
a O
deeper O
and O
clearer O
awareness O
! O

The O
reform O
and O
opening O
- O
up O
as O
well O
as O
the O
socialist O
market O
economy O
have O
also O
undoubtedly O
undergone O
a O
trial O
. O

What O
was O
the O
result O
? O

The O
weaker O
is O
the O
level O
of O
marketization O
, O
the O
stronger O
is O
the O
ability O
to O
resist O
setbacks O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
say O
much O
more O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
there O
is O
no O
absolute O
need O
to O
test O
it O
for O
yourself O
. O

It O
is O
enough O
to O
take O
a O
look O
at O
the O
hurricane O
in O
New O
Orleans O
in O
the O
United O
States O
and O
do O
a O
comparison O
! O

How O
did O
the O
US O
, O
which O
claims O
to O
be O
the O
strongest O
and O
most O
advanced O
in O
the O
world O
, O
perform O
when O
confronted O
with O
the O
New O
Orleans O
hurricane O
? O

It O
has O
remained O
a O
subject O
for O
world O
ridicule O
even O
today O
. O

But O
they O
themselves O
have O
believed O
that O
they O
did O
rather O
well O
. O

Why O
? O

Because O
their O
market O
economy O
is O
so O
standardized O
, O
so O
ubiquitous O
, O
and O
everyone O
believes O
so O
deeply O
in O
the O
almighty O
power O
of O
money O
and O
the O
supremacy O
of O
individual O
rights O
! O

In O
addition O
, O
they O
could O
not O
possibly O
mobilize O
people O
like O
us O
in O
this O
way O
, O
because O
they O
do O
not O
have O
this O
sort O
of O
spiritual O
strength O
that O
we O
have O
! O

Evidence O
shows O
that O
once O
an O
employee O
becomes O
the O
boss O
, O
he O
/ O
she O
will O
never O
show O
mercy O
to O
workers O
, O
with O
even O
wiser O
tricks O
to O
discipline O
staff O
than O
those O
who O
have O
always O
been O
a O
boss O
. O

Having O
come O
from O
the O
camp O
, O
he O
knows O
well O
how O
to O
hit O
the O
tender O
spots O
of O
employees O
. O

Employees O
who O
work O
for O
such O
a O
boss O
can O
never O
find O
a O
loophole O
. O

Such O
a O
kind O
of O
bosses O
are O
even O
more O
fierce O
than O
those O
who O
are O
" O
hereditary O
" O
. O

It O
is O
said O
that O
Zhang O
Yin O
, O
a O
native O
of O
Heilongjiang O
and O
born O
in O
Guangdong O
in O
1957 O
, O
had O
poor O
and O
miserable O
childhood O
due O
to O
her O
father O
's O
persecution O
and O
the O
large O
number O
of O
siblings O
in O
her O
family O
. O

At O
the O
age O
of O
27 O
, O
Zhang O
Yin O
gave O
up O
her O
hard O
- O
earned O
salary O
and O
housing O
and O
took O
with O
her O
RMB O
30,000 O
to O
make O
a O
living O
in O
Hong O
Kong O
, O
starting O
a O
scrap O
paper O
- O
for O
- O
cash O
business O
. O

She O
went O
to O
the O
United O
States O
and O
established O
a O
company O
in O
1990 O
, O
and O
became O
the O
queen O
of O
scrap O
paper O
recycling O
10 O
years O
later O
. O

She O
invested O
in O
a O
new O
factory O
in O
1996 O
in O
Dongguan O
, O
Guangdong O
, O
which O
specializes O
in O
producing O
high O
- O
grade O
wrapping O
paper O
. O

Her O
secret O
to O
success O
is O
an O
industrial O
chain O
constructed O
with O
" O
two O
lows O
, O
" O
which O
involve O
buying O
scrap O
paper O
at O
a O
low O
price O
in O
the O
United O
States O
and O
then O
producing O
highly O
sought O
- O
after O
high O
- O
grade O
paper O
products O
by O
taking O
advantage O
of O
the O
cheap O
land O
, O
energy O
and O
labor O
in O
the O
mainland O
. O

When O
building O
a O
simple O
building O
in O
the O
past O
, O
branches O
, O
ah O
, O
bamboo O
fences O
, O
ah O
, O
are O
used O
to O
build O
buildings O
, O
but O
there O
is O
a O
disadvantage O
to O
these O
kinds O
of O
buildings O
, O
that O
is O
, O
they O
easily O
catch O
fire O
. O

I O
think O
now O
our O
country O
should O
research O
a O
kind O
of O
low O
- O
cost O
plastic O
that O
does O
n't O
catch O
fire O
, O
but O
is O
very O
inexpensive O
. O

What O
would O
it O
be O
like O
to O
use O
this O
kind O
of O
cheap O
plastic O
to O
build O
buildings O
? O

Therefore O
, O
I O
propose O
that O
if O
an O
elementary O
school O
or O
a O
residential O
building O
is O
to O
be O
built O
in O
an O
earthquake O
- O
prone O
area O
in O
our O
country O
, O
it O
should O
depend O
on O
whether O
or O
not O
there O
is O
enough O
money O
to O
construct O
the O
building O
with O
extremely O
strong O
earthquake O
resistance O
? O

This O
point O
-- O
many O
buildings O
of O
ancient O
times O
in O
our O
country O
still O
remain O
today O
, O
and O
there O
are O
also O
some O
experiences O
of O
buildings O
abroad O
, O
plus O
all O
kinds O
of O
modern O
science O
and O
technology O
, O
buildings O
can O
be O
made O
extremely O
sturdy O
. O

If O
there O
is O
indeed O
not O
enough O
money O
, O
then O
they O
should O
rather O
not O
build O
it O
and O
save O
the O
money O
. O

Instead O
they O
should O
rather O
simply O
build O
simple O
buildings O
that O
can O
be O
constructed O
using O
cheap O
and O
fireproof O
plastic O
, O
letting O
students O
take O
classes O
in O
those O
simple O
buildings O
. O

Even O
though O
it O
may O
be O
somewhat O
crude O
, O
it O
actually O
can O
ensure O
the O
safety O
of O
lives O
when O
earthquakes O
strike O
. O

Based O
on O
if O
the O
approach O
is O
moral O
, O
methods O
of O
search O
engine O
optimization O
have O
been O
divided O
into O
two O
groups O
, O
black O
hat O
SEO O
and O
white O
hat O
SEO O
. O

Both O
methods O
can O
help O
you O
-LRB- O
improve O
search O
engine O
ranking O
-RRB- O
, O
and O
one O
of O
them O
enables O
you O
to O
improve O
your O
ranking O
quickly O
. O

However O
, O
this O
more O
aggressive O
method O
may O
make O
your O
website O
punished O
by O
some O
search O
engines O
, O
which O
will O
refuse O
to O
include O
it O
and O
issue O
a O
warning O
to O
you O
. O

These O
search O
engine O
companies O
have O
also O
said O
publicly O
on O
their O
official O
sites O
that O
using O
black O
hat O
SEO O
will O
only O
bring O
you O
trouble O
. O

What O
is O
white O
hat O
SEO O
technology O
? O

White O
hat O
SEO O
means O
that O
one O
does O
not O
attempt O
to O
cheat O
search O
engines O
and O
follow O
the O
rules O
they O
set O
when O
doing O
SEO O
. O

Additionally O
, O
web O
pages O
optimized O
using O
such O
methods O
are O
beneficial O
to O
Internet O
surfing O
and O
manifest O
the O
win O
- O
win O
result O
of O
search O
engines O
and O
network O
administrators O
in O
a O
good O
way O
. O

What O
is O
black O
hat O
SEO O
technology O
? O

Since O
black O
hat O
SEO O
involves O
cheating O
, O
such O
a O
way O
to O
improve O
ranking O
is O
not O
endorsed O
by O
search O
engines O
. O

These O
methods O
include O
over O
- O
redirecting O
to O
pages O
and O
hidden O
texts O
etc O
. O

Even O
if O
search O
engines O
have O
made O
it O
clear O
that O
they O
would O
punish O
websites O
that O
use O
black O
hat O
SEO O
, O
the O
latter O
would O
still O
not O
cease O
their O
acts O
. O

Why O
? O

Let O
's O
put O
aside O
prior O
donations O
Wang O
Shi O
has O
made O
. O

While O
it O
was O
still O
time O
to O
save O
lives O
in O
the O
disaster O
relief O
, O
he O
Wang O
Shi O
had O
been O
to O
the O
Sichuan O
Construction O
Authority O
to O
meet O
with O
officials O
from O
the O
Ministry O
of O
Housing O
and O
Urban O
- O
Rural O
Development O
, O
among O
others O
. O

What O
's O
the O
purpose O
of O
his O
act O
? O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
is O
obvious O
enough O
that O
the O
Sichuan O
Provincial O
Construction O
Authority O
was O
certainly O
an O
important O
player O
in O
post-disaster O
rebuilding O
. O

That O
is O
to O
say O
basically O
all O
future O
rebuilding O
will O
be O
done O
through O
the O
Construction O
Authority O
. O

It O
's O
a O
preemptive O
way O
to O
have O
meetings O
now O
in O
advance O
with O
the O
Construction O
Authority O
amid O
disaster O
relief O
. O

That O
is O
100 O
million O
yuan O
is O
first O
donated O
as O
its O
deposit O
for O
post-disaster O
rebuilding O
, O
such O
that O
Vanke O
's O
income O
will O
not O
be O
100 O
million O
yuan O
, O
but O
a O
substantial O
part O
of O
the O
75 O
billion O
yuan O
the O
country O
will O
invest O
. O

We O
can O
say O
Vanke O
has O
got O
very O
smart O
public O
measures O
, O
which O
proves O
" O
Vanke O
has O
been O
doing O
well O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
government O
relationship O
and O
brand O
image O
. O

This O
is O
their O
specialty O
. O
" O

Therefore O
, O
we O
see O
Vanke O
has O
tried O
to O
hook O
a O
big O
fish O
with O
a O
small O
profit O
-LRB- O
the O
donation O
is O
less O
than O
0.04 O
% O
of O
their O
net O
profit O
-RRB- O
!!! O

What O
on O
earth O
does O
Vanke O
do O
? O

I O
had O
no O
idea O
, O
until O
now O
that O
it O
is O
a O
parasite O
fed O
by O
mortgage O
slaves O
, O
and O
it O
turns O
out O
that O
=it O
would O
be O
such O
a O
miser O
! O

I O
guess O
the O
leaders O
might O
be O
feeling O
a O
bit O
fed O
up O
recently O
. O

Wang O
Dong O
just O
finished O
saying O
free O
oneself O
from O
old O
ideas O
, O
emancipate O
the O
mind O
, O
when O
out O
comes O
some O
Hong O
Kong O
extreme O
left O
- O
wing O
students O
exposing O
and O
criticizing O
" O
sweat O
shops O
" O
. O

Guangdong O
Province O
Federation O
of O
Trade O
Unions O
bosses O
personally O
investigated O
the O
matter O
and O
shot O
the O
whole O
so O
- O
called O
" O
sweat O
shop O
" O
factories O
matter O
down O
in O
flames O
, O
not O
dreaming O
that O
the O
specter O
of O
" O
child O
labor O
" O
would O
then O
rear O
its O
head O
. O

How O
could O
a O
child O
labor O
problem O
arise O
? O

The O
brilliant O
experts O
and O
professors O
immediately O
identified O
the O
root O
of O
the O
problem O
: O
Poverty O
is O
the O
real O
reason O
! O

I O
have O
no O
use O
for O
the O
current O
crop O
of O
intellectuals O
. O

Most O
of O
them O
are O
all O
really O
stupid O
, O
do O
n't O
know O
one O
end O
of O
academia O
from O
the O
other O
, O
while O
a O
few O
clever O
ones O
are O
overdoing O
it O
, O
and O
are O
busy O
being O
lackeys O
for O
the O
bureaucrats O
and O
private O
entrepreneurs O
. O

For O
example O
, O
today O
's O
experts O
often O
ask O
: O
why O
do O
" O
sex O
workers O
" O
always O
come O
back O
? O

This O
is O
also O
due O
to O
poverty O
. O

Although O
we O
know O
that O
" O
Poverty O
is O
not O
Socialism O
" O
, O
however O
I O
suppose O
with O
poverty O
must O
come O
child O
labor O
? O
Must O
come O
" O
sex O
workers O
" O
? O

Poverty O
is O
only O
one O
cause O
leading O
to O
the O
problems O
of O
child O
labor O
and O
" O
sex O
workers O
" O
, O
and O
is O
by O
no O
means O
a O
totally O
necessary O
prerequisite O
. O
Because O
for O
such O
a O
substantial O
period O
of O
history O
, O
China O
although O
still O
very O
much O
in O
" O
poverty O
" O
, O
was O
able O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
issues O
of O
child O
labor O
and O
" O
sex O
workers O
" O
in O
a O
way O
unparalleled O
in O
history O
. O

The O
factory O
managers O
of O
those O
times O
, O
had O
they O
been O
even O
bolder O
, O
would O
never O
have O
entertained O
the O
thought O
of O
exploiting O
child O
labor O
; O

The O
intellectuals O
of O
those O
times O
, O
had O
they O
been O
even O
more O
liberated O
, O
would O
not O
have O
dared O
to O
drum O
up O
support O
for O
the O
" O
out O
in O
the O
sunshine O
" O
management O
of O
" O
sex O
workers O
" O
. O

These O
" O
patriots O
" O
ought O
to O
know O
, O
if O
you O
obtain O
the O
citizenship O
of O
a O
foreign O
country O
you O
are O
no O
longer O
a O
" O
Chinese O
" O
, O
but O
instead O
just O
an O
" O
overseas O
Chinese O
" O
. O

You O
should O
love O
the O
country O
you O
belong O
to O
, O
do O
your O
duty O
towards O
it O
, O
make O
a O
contribution O
; O
this O
is O
the O
minimum O
moral O
standard O
required O
of O
a O
person O
. O

If O
you O
still O
have O
some O
feeling O
for O
your O
native O
land O
, O
please O
help O
it O
move O
from O
savagery O
to O
civilization O
, O
instead O
of O
holding O
a O
candle O
to O
the O
devil O
and O
pulling O
it O
into O
darkness O
; O

If O
you O
have O
got O
yourself O
a O
foreign O
country O
's O
green O
card O
, O
you O
owe O
a O
favor O
to O
both O
your O
mother O
country O
and O
your O
country O
of O
residence O
. O

You O
should O
put O
your O
heart O
and O
soul O
into O
promoting O
understanding O
, O
communication O
and O
friendship O
between O
the O
two O
countries O
. O

If O
you O
guys O
wish O
China O
to O
have O
a O
favorable O
image O
, O
then O
you O
ought O
to O
work O
to O
clean O
away O
the O
grime O
and O
=abscesses O
on O
her O
body O
. O

And O
if O
you O
would O
like O
to O
see O
Chinese O
people O
respected O
by O
the O
world O
, O
you O
guys O
first O
should O
learn O
how O
to O
be O
a O
civilized O
person O
. O

Regrettably O
, O
the O
behavior O
of O
some O
of O
you O
is O
currently O
adding O
substance O
to O
the O
words O
of O
that O
CNN O
anchorman O
. O

You O
guys O
ought O
to O
understand O
that O
maybe O
from O
your O
verbal O
violence O
, O
CNN O
's O
reporters O
will O
no O
longer O
say O
this O
kind O
of O
thing O
, O
but O
there O
will O
be O
more O
people O
who O
will O
say O
it O

Things O
for O
Improvement O
as O
Exposed O
in O
the O
Disaster O
Rescue O
Effort O
I O
'm O
not O
writing O
this O
article O
to O
criticize O
anyone O
. O

As O
I O
was O
not O
personally O
on O
the O
scene O
, O
I O
definitely O
ca O
n't O
grasp O
the O
main O
threads O
of O
the O
matter O
with O
accuracy O
. O

Here O
I O
'm O
simply O
writing O
down O
a O
few O
thoughts O
of O
mine O
. O

In O
the O
fallout O
of O
the O
Wenchuan O
earthquake O
this O
time O
, O
the O
PLA O
entered O
disaster O
- O
hit O
areas O
for O
rescue O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
could O
. O

Due O
to O
the O
urgency O
in O
time O
and O
unprecedented O
transparency O
in O
news O
reports O
, O
I O
've O
been O
able O
to O
see O
some O
of O
the O
things O
more O
clearly O
than O
before O
. O

First O
, O
the O
progress O
of O
the O
PLA O
these O
years O
are O
certainly O
able O
to O
be O
fully O
reflected O
. O

I O
think O
the O
most O
important O
progress O
is O
the O
improvement O
in O
its O
strategic O
airlifting O
capacity O
. O

With O
imported O
IL O
- O
76 O
and O
homemade O
Y O
- O
8 O
, O
the O
PLA O
Air O
Force O
airlifted O
several O
dozen O
thousand O
people O
to O
disaster O
- O
hit O
areas O
within O
an O
extremely O
short O
period O
of O
time O
. O

Troops O
like O
those O
of O
the O
Jinan O
Military O
Area O
Command O
were O
entirely O
airlifted O
, O
which O
was O
definitely O
unimaginable O
before O
. O

However O
, O
personally O
I O
think O
a O
larger O
number O
of O
problems O
have O
been O
exposed O
: O

1. O
Reconnaissance O
capabilities O
are O
seriously O
lacking O
. O

The O
epicenter O
, O
Wenchuan O
, O
was O
insulated O
from O
the O
outside O
world O
following O
the O
earthquake O
, O
making O
it O
hard O
for O
the O
command O
and O
people O
of O
the O
entire O
nation O
to O
know O
the O
situation O
at O
the O
epicenter O
, O
at O
which O
time O
the O
PLA O
's O
various O
reconnaissance O
measures O
should O
have O
been O
of O
great O
use O
, O
yet O
the O
result O
was O
hugely O
surprising O
. O

For O
such O
a O
great O
historic O
event O
as O
the O
Beijing O
Olympics O
, O
Mr. O
Wu O
of O
course O
must O
go O
to O
Beijing O
to O
personally O
experience O
the O
exciting O
scene O
. O

After O
painstaking O
efforts O
, O
he O
reached O
an O
agreement O
with O
his O
boss O
at O
the O
company O
to O
take O
a O
two O
- O
month O
vacation O
. O

In O
accordance O
with O
the O
instructions O
regarding O
the O
visa O
application O
listed O
on O
the O
website O
of O
the O
Chinese O
consulate O
, O
Mr. O
Wu O
prepared O
the O
required O
documents O
, O
photos O
, O
etc O
. O

He O
also O
noticed O
that O
it O
was O
especially O
suggested O
on O
the O
consulate O
website O
that O
visa O
should O
be O
secured O
first O
before O
purchasing O
an O
airline O
ticket O
. O

He O
thought O
the O
comrades O
at O
the O
consulate O
were O
very O
considerate O
and O
thoughtful O
for O
their O
compatriots O
. O

On O
the O
day O
he O
went O
to O
the O
consulate O
in O
New O
York O
, O
he O
told O
a O
lie O
, O
saying O
he O
was O
sick O
and O
=asked O
for O
sick O
leave O
for O
a O
day O
. O

There O
were O
lots O
of O
people O
at O
the O
consulate O
, O
and O
he O
waited O
in O
line O
for O
four O
whole O
hours O
. O

Seeing O
that O
so O
many O
people O
were O
applying O
to O
go O
to O
China O
, O
he O
was O
very O
much O
moved O
. O

The O
motherland O
was O
indeed O
full O
of O
glamour O
, O
and O
he O
felt O
extremely O
proud O
. O

By O
the O
time O
he O
reached O
the O
window O
, O
his O
stuff O
was O
immediately O
thrown O
back O
: O
Materials O
not O
sufficient O
! O

He O
must O
additionally O
submit O
a O
return O
airline O
ticket O
and O
a O
letter O
of O
invitation O
from O
his O
relative O
or O
friend O
in O
China O
. O

" O
But O
it O
is O
said O
on O
the O
website O
of O
your O
consulate O
that O
visa O
application O
should O
be O
made O
first O
before O
purchasing O
an O
airline O
ticket O
. O
" O

The O
answer O
was O
: O
" O
There O
are O
new O
regulations O
now O
, O
and O
new O
regulations O
shall O
prevail O
. O
" O

Somewhat O
astounded O
, O
Mr. O
Wu O
tried O
hard O
to O
blame O
himself O
, O
" O
How O
come O
I O
had O
n't O
thought O
about O
these O
in O
advance O
. O
" O

The O
Chinese O
government O
has O
responded O
quickly O
to O
the O
earthquake O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
all O
of O
the O
media O
, O
primarily O
composed O
of O
state O
- O
owned O
media O
, O
has O
spared O
no O
efforts O
in O
presenting O
the O
government O
's O
best O
face O
to O
the O
Chinese O
people O
who O
have O
united O
as O
never O
before O
. O

This O
is O
all O
helpful O
for O
improving O
the O
image O
of O
the O
central O
government O
, O
demonstrating O
that O
it O
is O
responsible O
and O
highly O
efficient O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
great O
sympathy O
that O
the O
world O
has O
shown O
when O
facing O
this O
disaster O
has O
at O
least O
for O
now O
quieted O
the O
criticism O
of O
Beijing O
about O
Tibet O
and O
other O
issues O
, O
while O
the O
various O
sorts O
of O
condemnation O
earlier O
had O
cast O
a O
shadow O
over O
the O
successful O
hosting O
of O
this O
summer O
's O
Olympics O
by O
Beijing O
. O

Huang O
Jing O
, O
an O
expert O
on O
Chinese O
political O
issues O
at O
the O
East O
Asian O
Institute O
-LRB- O
East O
Asian O
Institute O
-RRB- O
of O
the O
=National O
University O
of O
Singapore O
, O
stated O
that O
although O
Chinese O
leaders O
clearly O
would O
rather O
this O
kind O
of O
disaster O
causing O
tremendous O
losses O
of O
people O
and O
property O
had O
not O
occurred O
, O
this O
earthquake O
has O
provided O
a O
political O
golden O
opportunity O
for O
Beijing O
authorities O
, O
and O
they O
can O
use O
this O
to O
prove O
that O
they O
have O
the O
ability O
to O
take O
good O
care O
of O
the O
Chinese O
people O
and O
have O
the O
ability O
to O
resolve O
this O
kind O
of O
crisis O
. O

Moreover O
, O
in O
the O
area O
of O
furthering O
earthquake O
precautions O
, O
the O
entire O
globe O
has O
not O
seen O
much O
improvement O
. O

However O
, O
I O
do O
believe O
that O
at O
least O
in O
the O
few O
seconds O
just O
before O
an O
earthquake O
strikes O
, O
for O
example O
say O
five O
seconds O
or O
even O
ten O
seconds O
before O
, O
there O
would O
be O
a O
small O
vibration O
that O
the O
human O
body O
can O
not O
detect O
. O

Even O
though O
people O
can O
not O
feel O
it O
, O
instruments O
ought O
to O
be O
more O
sensitive O
. O

The O
minute O
it O
is O
felt O
by O
the O
instruments O
, O
if O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
sound O
an O
alarm O
on O
the O
streets O
ten O
seconds O
ahead O
of O
time O
, O
giving O
people O
a O
chance O
to O
get O
under O
desks O
, O
then O
perhaps O
that O
would O
save O
a O
lot O
of O
lives O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
because O
modern O
instruments O
are O
very O
sensitive O
, O
they O
are O
frequently O
interfered O
with O
by O
the O
sound O
of O
people O
's O
footsteps O
, O
the O
roar O
of O
vehicles O
, O
and O
so O
on O
. O

But O
the O
likely O
emission O
pattern O
of O
these O
man O
- O
made O
sounds O
is O
distinct O
from O
the O
pattern O
of O
underground O
tremors O
, O
so O
this O
is O
asking O
our O
country O
's O
pattern O
recognition O
workers O
to O
put O
some O
time O
and O
effort O
into O
trying O
to O
distinguish O
these O
sounds O
from O
tremors O
, O
try O
to O
separate O
underground O
vibrations O
from O
the O
vibrations O
caused O
by O
people O
. O

This O
ought O
to O
be O
technologically O
feasible O
. O

Since O
the O
Tangshan O
Earthquake O
, O
the O
starting O
point O
for O
construction O
standards O
in O
the O
mainland O
is O
that O
under O
an O
earthquake O
of O
the O
same O
magnitude O
, O
buildings O
should O
preserve O
their O
basic O
frame O
without O
collapsing O
. O

However O
, O
most O
of O
the O
buildings O
in O
this O
hard O
- O
hit O
area O
did O
not O
meet O
these O
requirements O
, O
with O
the O
widespread O
collapse O
of O
school O
buildings O
in O
particular O
arousing O
intense O
public O
disgust O
. O

Raising O
standards O
to O
in O
excess O
of O
Tangshan O
's O
8.0 O
magnitude O
could O
leave O
authorities O
with O
some O
breathing O
space O
for O
explanation O
, O
and O
alleviate O
public O
anger O
. O

According O
to O
information O
leaked O
from O
numerous O
channels O
, O
we O
can O
say O
for O
certain O
that O
before O
the O
earthquake O
struck O
, O
the O
serious O
earthquake O
risk O
in O
the O
Ngawa O
region O
was O
already O
well O
known O
to O
the O
CCP O
. O

Although O
current O
forecasting O
standards O
can O
not O
give O
us O
an O
accurate O
prediction O
of O
the O
exact O
time O
, O
place O
, O
and O
strength O
of O
an O
earthquake O
, O
there O
is O
considerable O
experience O
accumulated O
both O
in O
China O
and O
overseas O
in O
predicting O
to O
within O
the O
timeframe O
of O
a O
month O
, O
and O
the O
area O
of O
a O
province O
. O

In O
regions O
where O
the O
earthquake O
risk O
is O
high O
, O
warning O
the O
public O
and O
spreading O
disaster O
prevention O
awareness O
could O
greatly O
reduce O
casualties O
during O
earthquakes O
; O
this O
is O
the O
very O
minimum O
duty O
that O
any O
responsible O
government O
should O
undertake O
. O

In O
the O
past O
the O
CCP O
has O
done O
a O
lot O
of O
these O
sorts O
of O
things O
, O
but O
on O
this O
occasion O
not O
only O
did O
nothing O
, O
but O
in O
response O
to O
queries O
from O
the O
public O
pulled O
out O
some O
whopping O
lies O
, O
playing O
syntax O
games O
with O
words O
like O
" O
geological O
disaster O
" O
and O
" O
earthquake O
disaster O
" O
. O

At O
present O
, O
our O
nation O
's O
law O
encompasses O
all O
the O
laws O
and O
procedures O
made O
by O
the O
country O

There O
is O
only O
one O
word O
's O
difference O
between O
" O
website O

" O
and O
" O
network O
operations O
, O
" O
so O
it O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
get O
them O
mixed O
up O
. O

Website O
operations O
refers O
to O
operational O
and O
management O
work O
relating O
to O
product O
management O
, O
content O
management O
, O
updating O
the O
content O
and O

and O
so O
on O
of O
a O
website O
on O
the O

. O

In O
broad O
terms O
, O
this O
includes O
several O
components O
, O
such O
as O
website O
planning O
, O
product O
development O
, O
network O
marketing O
and O
customer O
services O
. O

In O
narrow O
terms O
, O
it O
refers O
particularly O
to O
operational O
and O
management O
work O
after O
a O
website O
has O
been O
set O
up O

such O

As O
a O
matter O

fact O
, O
the O
term O
" O

" O
is O
rarely O
used O
and O
can O
not O
mean O
the O
same O
as O
" O
website O

" O

A O
network O
is O
a O
very O
broad O
concept O
and O
refers O
in O
a O
general O
sense O
to O
various O
types O
of O
networks O
formed O
by O
computer O
network O
hardware O
. O

More O
often O
than O
not O
, O
network O
operations O
refers O
to O
the O
operation O
of O
these O
networks O
, O
like O
construction O
of O
and O
connection O
to O
part O
of O
the O

by O
China O

And O
in O
" O

, O
" O
this O
network O
refers O
particularly O
to O

meaning O
activities O

carried O
out O

Mao O
Zedong O
as O
with O
others O
of O
his O
age O
group O
, O
every O
year O
would O
not O
fail O
to O
remember O
his O
birthday O
. O

As O
a O
leader O
with O
sovereign O
authority O
, O
Mao O
Zedong O
was O
entitled O
to O
a O
rousing O
and O
extravagantly O
lavish O
birthday O
celebration O
every O
year O
. O

However O
Mao O
Zedong O
since O
his O
Yan'an O
days O
championed O
a O
party O
- O
wide O
" O
no O
celebration O
, O
no O
gifts O
" O
policy O
. O

After O
the O
liberation O
, O
he O
was O
even O
more O
about O
setting O
the O
example O
and O
strictly O
forbade O
the O
practice O
of O
celebrations O
and O
gift O
- O
giving O
within O
the O
party O
. O

Because O
of O
this O
, O
Mao O
Zedong O
preferred O
to O
spend O
his O
birthday O
in O
a O
very O
mundane O
fashion O
, O
and O
absolutely O
not O
set O
the O
" O
celebrating O
birthday O
and O
giving O
gifts O
" O
trend O
. O

During O
his O
Yan'an O
period O
, O
Mao O
Zedong O
's O
life O
was O
comparatively O
quiet O
, O
but O
each O
year O
on O
his O
birthday O
he O
would O
just O
add O
a O
few O
extra O
dishes O
for O
dinner O
at O
home O
, O
the O
family O
happily O
eating O
a O
birthday O
meal O
together O
. O

December O
26 O
, O
1943 O
was O
Mao O
Zedong O
's O
50th O
birthday O
. O

In O
China O
, O
the O
50th O
birthday O
is O
known O
as O
a O
' O
major O
birthday O
' O
, O
and O
there O
were O
people O
in O
Yan'an O
preparing O
to O
put O
on O
a O
celebration O
for O
Mao O
Zedong O
, O
but O
Mao O
Zedong O
steadfastly O
refused O
. O

And O
so O
Mao O
Zedong O
's O
50th O
birthday O
crept O
by O
in O
the O
flames O
of O
war O
and O
smoke O
of O
guns O
. O

On O
December O
26 O
, O
1953 O
, O
Mao O
Zedong O
turned O
60 O
. O

This O
is O
a O
" O
huajia O
" O
birthday O
, O
which O
Chinese O
people O
have O
valued O
since O
antiquity O
; O
Mao O
Zedong O
also O
thought O
a O
lot O
of O
this O
transition O
, O
since O
after O
huajia O
he O
could O
be O
addressed O
as O
an O
elderly O
person O
. O

But O
Mao O
Zedong O
just O
arranged O
a O
small O
spread O
at O
home O
, O
celebrating O
by O
himself O
. O

Later O
, O
more O
and O
more O
friends O
around O
me O
who O
had O
been O
using O
Sinablog O
have O
moved O
, O
to O
places O
including O
163blog O
, O
Sohublog O
, O
and O
Blogbus O
. O

It O
seem O
Sinablog O
is O
losing O
popularity O
. O

Indeed O
, O
that O
interface O
of O
Sinablog O
, O
I O
guess O
, O
have O
stayed O
unchanged O
for O
at O
least O
two O
years O
. O

The O
more O
I O
look O
at O
it O
, O
the O
grosser O
it O
becomes O
. O

A O
product O
that O
stands O
still O
will O
sooner O
or O
later O
be O
replaced O
. O

-LRB- O
While O
I O
ca O
n't O
say O
Sinablog O
did O
n't O
upgrade O
at O
all O
, O
as O
there O
has O
been O
functional O
upgrades O
, O
but O
there O
have O
been O
few O
changes O
to O
the O
interface O
layout O
. O
-RRB- O

I O
remember O
when O
I O
worked O
on O
the O
blog O
previously O
, O
I O
compared O
quite O
a O
few O
different O
BSPs O
and O
did O
n't O
like O
Sinablog O
even O
back O
then O
. O

I O
've O
registered O
Sinablog O
, O
but O
have O
not O
written O
many O
articles O
or O
even O
tried O
all O
the O
functions O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
registered O
163blog O
, O
but O
many O
friends O
are O
using O
it O
, O
which O
looks O
good O
. O

I O
've O
also O
registered O
Baidu O
Space O
, O
also O
on O
a O
trial O
basis O
, O
but O
it O
also O
feels O
better O
than O
Sina O
's O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
what O
I O
said O
here O
is O
fairly O
subjective O
and O
one O
- O
sided O
, O
even O
with O
a O
tint O
of O
personal O
bias O
. O

Instead O
of O
doing O
a O
test O
, O
I O
'm O
purely O
talking O
about O
my O
own O
feelings O
. O

After O
the O
nineties O
, O
state O
- O
owned O
engineering O
enterprises O
stopped O
recruiting O
construction O
workers O
. O

But O
that O
is O
n't O
to O
say O
they O
stopped O
hiring O
people O
, O
but O
those O
they O
took O
in O
were O
all O
graduates O
with O
professional O
diplomas O
from O
polytechnic O
schools O
, O
technical O
colleges O
, O
and O
universities O
; O
these O
staff O
all O
went O
into O
management O
. O

During O
the O
early O
nineties O
, O
the O
formal O
employees O
of O
this O
enterprise O
still O
had O
complete O
working O
teams O
, O
such O
as O
bricklaying O
teams O
, O
woodwork O
teams O
, O
steel O
reinforcement O
teams O
, O
and O
machinery O
maintenance O
teams O
, O
but O
since O
they O
could O
not O
cope O
with O
a O
large O
volume O
of O
project O
tasks O
, O
they O
were O
already O
cooperating O
with O
some O
migrant O
worker O
units O
, O
in O
other O
words O
the O
familiar O
" O
contracting O
gangs O
" O
. O

A O
collision O
occurred O
between O
tradition O
and O
reality O
. O

Due O
to O
formal O
working O
units O
no O
longer O
taking O
on O
young O
employees O
, O
working O
units O
got O
increasingly O
older O
and O
broken O
up O
. O

Some O
staff O
-LRB- O
extremely O
few O
-RRB- O
entered O
management O
. O

A O
few O
exceptional O
former O
team O
leaders O
gradually O
became O
project O
managers O
. O

Others O
became O
materials O
officers O
, O
safety O
officers O
and O
quality O
control O
officers O
, O
etc O
. O

Those O
without O
connections O
became O
staff O
monitoring O
the O
construction O
site O
------ O
similar O
to O
the O
security O
guards O
of O
today O
. O

The O
workers O
no O
longer O
formed O
complete O
operating O
teams O
. O

And O
at O
this O
time O
, O
migrant O
worker O
units O
gained O
an O
opportunity O
to O
develop O
. O

The O
entire O
on O
- O
site O
operation O
work O
was O
all O
carried O
out O
by O
contracting O
gangs O
. O

Working O
units O
disbanded O
. O

The O
status O
of O
these O
workers O
was O
also O
changing O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
care O
how O
much O
Wang O
Shi O
wastes O
every O
time O
he O
climbs O
a O
mountain O
, O
but O
I O
do O
strongly O
despise O
how O
he O
talks O
and O
the O
way O
he O
acts O
during O
this O
whole O
thing O
. O

After O
donating O
, O
he O
suggested O
that O
charity O
should O
not O
be O
the O
burden O
of O
businesses O
, O
and O
-LRB- O
therefore O
-RRB- O
stipulated O
that O
his O
company O
's O
employee O
donations O
should O
not O
exceed O
10 O
yuan O
. O

Totally O
absurd O
logic O
. O

Wang O
Shi O
's O
reasoning O
is O
that O
making O
donations O
to O
charities O
then O
the O
burden O
of O
businesses O
could O
cause O
companies O
to O
fail O
in O
market O
competition O
; O

But O
we O
can O
see O
such O
philanthropists O
as O
Bill O
Gates O
, O
Li O
Ka O
- O
shing O
, O
Jackie O
Chan O
have O
not O
affected O
the O
growth O
of O
their O
enterprises O
in O
any O
way O
. O

Instead O
, O
they O
have O
actually O
increased O
the O
competitiveness O
of O
their O
companies O
. O

And O
there O
were O
some O
netizens O
who O
hit O
back O
in O
the O
Wang O
Shi O
donations O
issue O
by O
admonishing O
us O
for O
forcing O
donations O
on O
moral O
grounds O
. O

Exactly O
! O

An O
excellent O
justification O
! O

If O
you O
say O
that O
netizens O
rebuking O
Wang O
Shi O
is O
forcing O
donations O
, O
then O
what O
kind O
of O
behavior O
is O
Wang O
Shi O
preventing O
employees O
from O
donating O
more O
than O
10 O
yuan O
? O

Wang O
Shi O
is O
the O
economic O
version O
of O
a O
cold O
- O
blooded O
animal O
, O
and O
we O
do O
n't O
care O
, O

but O
, O
how O
come O
he O
wants O
to O
restrict O
what O
employees O
do O
or O
do O
n't O
do O
on O
moral O
grounds O
? O

This O
really O
is O
a O
case O
of O
one O
rule O
for O
some O
, O
another O
rule O
for O
everyone O
else O
!!! O

People O
in O
disaster O
- O
hit O
areas O
are O
suffering O
pains O
and O
hardships O
. O

If O
people O
continue O
to O
be O
passionate O
, O
hilarious O
, O
joyful O
and O
relaying O
as O
usual O
, O
then O
, O
all O
these O
will O
inevitably O
become O
aloofness O
, O
numbness O
and O
ridiculousness O
. O

If O
the O
torch O
relay O
is O
not O
terminated O
, O
it O
is O
like O
a O
family O
having O
a O
funeral O
on O
the O
one O
hand O
and O
a O
wedding O
on O
the O
other O
, O
which O
is O
unacceptable O
, O
unreasonable O
and O
absurd O
. O

Instead O
, O
terminating O
the O
torch O
relay O
will O
reflect O
a O
kind O
of O
affection O
for O
compatriots O
and O
humane O
care O
, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
kind O
of O
attention O
, O
compassion O
and O
support O
of O
the O
whole O
nation O
towards O
those O
in O
the O
disaster O
- O
hit O
areas O
. O

Terminating O
the O
torch O
relay O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
will O
be O
able O
to O
win O
compassion O
, O
understanding O
and O
support O
of O
the O
international O
community O
, O
as O
well O
as O
understanding O
, O
endorsement O
and O
support O
of O
the O
whole O
nation O
. O

Terminating O
the O
torch O
relay O
will O
only O
present O
an O
image O
to O
the O
international O
community O
that O
the O
Chinese O
people O
face O
up O
to O
realities O
, O
seek O
truth O
and O
pragmatism O
, O
fear O
no O
difficulties O
, O
share O
one O
purpose O
, O
and O
unite O
to O
fight O
against O
the O
disaster O
. O

On O
the O
contrary O
, O
if O
we O
simply O
continue O
the O
relay O
, O
the O
international O
community O
will O
only O
turn O
a O
cold O
shoulder O
to O
and O
look O
down O
upon O
China O
. O

Cancel O
the O
relay O
, O
save O
the O
money O
that O
was O
meant O
for O
the O
relay O
and O
send O
it O
to O
areas O
affected O
by O
the O
disaster O
, O
so O
as O
to O
help O
the O
people O
there O
. O

Today O
, O
although O
our O
country O
has O
become O
much O
richer O
, O
with O
the O
increase O
in O
the O
size O
of O
homes O
and O
businesses O
comes O
huge O
waste O
. O

Every O
year O
regions O
in O
China O
suffer O
from O
droughts O
, O
floods O
, O
snowstorms O
, O
earthquakes O
and O
other O
such O
natural O
disasters O
. O

The O
Premier O
's O
billions O
in O
special O
expenditure O
were O
mainly O
used O
in O
helping O
the O
disaster O
victims O
. O

Although O
China O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
foreign O
exchange O
reserves O
, O
such O
reserves O
are O
used O
for O
purchasing O
foreign O
things O
. O

And O
also O
these O
foreign O
exchange O
reserves O
are O
China O
's O
in O
name O
, O
but O
in O
actual O
fact O
have O
owners O
-LRB- O
businesses O
-RRB- O
, O
and O
the O
country O
can O
not O
call O
upon O
them O
to O
spend O
at O
will O
. O

If O
we O
want O
to O
use O
them O
, O
this O
can O
only O
happen O
after O
buying O
them O
with O
RMB O
from O
the O
owners O
, O

If O
a O
trillion O
in O
foreign O
exchange O
reserves O
was O
used O
, O
the O
country O
would O
then O
have O
to O
issue O
more O
than O
7 O
trillion O
RMB O
to O
pay O
the O
owners O
of O
the O
foreign O
exchange O
reserves O
. O

This O
would O
ruin O
the O
currency O
issue O
regulation O
policy O
of O
the O
People O
's O
Bank O
, O
creating O
inflation O
. O

Only O
with O
donations O
from O
abroad O
can O
the O
country O
spend O
freely O
and O
resolve O
this O
pressing O
situation O
. O

I O
appeal O
to O
the O
overseas O
students O
, O
particularly O
those O
overseas O
Chinese O
countrymen O
who O
have O
a O
green O
card O
or O
citizenship O
and O
middle O
class O
people O
with O
family O
incomes O
to O
the O
tune O
of O
100 O
- O
thousand O
, O
to O
hold O
on O
to O
the O
donations O
going O
to O
your O
American O
alma O
mater O
or O
church O
, O
and O
pledge O
them O
to O
your O
own O

, O
donate O
them O
to O
your O

who O
are O
still O
locked O
in O
the O
struggle O
for O
existence O
! O

December O
26 O
, O
1975 O
, O
Mao O
Zedong O
had O
his O
82th O
birth O
day O
, O
his O
last O
one O
. O

Upon O
turning O
80 O
, O
Mao O
Zedong O
felt O
apparently O
that O
he O
was O
old O
and O
would O
die O
soon O
. O

Therefore O
, O
around O
his O
birthday O
those O
few O
years O
, O
Mao O
Zedong O
had O
always O
talked O
about O
life O
and O
death O
from O
time O
to O
time O
. O

One O
thing O
he O
often O
said O
was O
: O
" O
73 O
and O
84 O
are O
ages O
at O
which O
you O
will O
be O
gone O
even O
if O
the O
King O
of O
Hell O
does O
n't O
call O
you O
. O
" O

Also O
since O
he O
turned O
80 O
, O
people O
had O
been O
paying O
more O
and O
more O
attention O
to O
Mao O
Zedong O
's O
birthday O
. O

Within O
the O
country O
, O
people O
dared O
not O
celebrate O
his O
birthday O
publicly O
, O
so O
they O
would O
celebrate O
quietly O
at O
home O
. O

Local O
governments O
dared O
not O
present O
gifts O
to O
Mao O
Zedong O
, O
but O
would O
convey O
their O
blessings O
to O
Mao O
Zedong O
in O
various O
ways O
. O

In O
the O
years O
before O
Mao O
Zedong O
passed O
away O
, O
his O
hometown O
Hunan O
would O
specially O
send O
things O
like O
long O
life O
noodles O
on O
December O
26 O
every O
year O
. O

For O
this O
, O
Mao O
Zedong O
had O
accepted O
with O
pleasure O
, O
which O
was O
quite O
unusual O
. O

Outside O
the O
country O
, O
socialist O
countries O
like O
North O
Korea O
would O
send O
some O
gifts O
such O
as O
art O
ware O
and O
food O
on O
December O
26 O
every O
year O
. O

Faced O
with O
the O
incoming O
telegraphs O
, O
letters O
and O
gifts O
for O
his O
birthday O
, O
Mao O
Zedong O
had O
occasionally O
been O
quite O
unhappy O
from O
within O
, O
but O
quite O
helpless O
as O
well O
. O

A O
good O
conscience O
can O
be O
seen O
. O

In O
the O
great O
earthquake O
in O
Wenchuan O
, O
when O
numerous O
" O
jerry O
- O
built O
" O
school O
buildings O
became O
the O
graves O
of O
buried O
students O
, O
five O
Hope O
Elementary O
Schools O
, O
built O
from O
donations O
by O
the O
" O
Han O
Long O
Group O
" O
ten O
years O
ago O
, O
are O
safe O
and O
sound O
. O

The O
" O
Greatest O
Hope O
Elementary O
School O
" O
-- O
Liu O
Han O
Hope O
Elementary O
School O
alone O
saved O
the O
lives O
of O
483 O
elementary O
school O
students O
and O
teachers O
. O

The O
five O
schools O
together O
protected O
the O
lives O
and O
safety O
of O
thousands O
of O
students O
and O
teachers O
! O

Obviously O
, O
the O
contribution O
of O
the O
Greatest O
Hope O
Elementary O
Schools O
is O
immeasurable O
. O

Not O
only O
do O
the O
Greatest O
Hope O
Elementary O
Schools O
personify O
good O
conscience O
, O
but O
they O
also O
make O
the O
conscience O
fuller O
. O

When O
some O
officials O
and O
earthquakes O
experts O
swore O
and O
solemnly O
stated O
that O
the O
schools O
could O
have O
easily O
collapsed O
before O
and O
gave O
a O
lot O
of O
reasons O
, O
the O
Hope O
Elementary O
Schools O
that O
did O
n't O
collapse O
exposed O
their O
shameful O
lies O
. O

This O
is O
the O
other O
reason O
why O
the O
Hope O
Elementary O
Schools O
touched O
China O
. O

Therefore O
, O
I O
suggest O
awarding O
a O
" O
People O
's O
Good O
Conscience O
" O
reward O
to O
the O
boss O
of O
the O
" O
Han O
Long O
Group O
" O
company O
, O
Liu O
Han O
, O
who O
is O
the O
donor O
of O
the O
Greatest O
Hope O
Elementary O
Schools O
and O
regards O
project O
quality O
as O
his O
own O
life O
, O
and O
to O
General O
manager O
Sun O
Xiaodong O
, O
to O
thank O
them O
for O
their O
contribution O
of O
cherishing O
human O
life O
and O
safeguarding O
human O
conscience O
. O

We O
should O
call O
on O
the O
whole O
society O
-LRB- O
especially O
the O
developers O
and O
officials O
at O
all O
levels O
who O
are O
already O
corrupt O
, O
becoming O
corrupt O
, O
are O
going O
to O
be O
corrupt O
but O
have O
n't O
yet O
started O
to O
be O
corrupt O
-RRB- O
to O
learn O
from O
them O
and O
spread O
the O
seeds O
of O
good O
conscience O
far O
and O
wide O
