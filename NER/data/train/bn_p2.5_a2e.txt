Your O
Excellency O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
it O
is O
said O
that O
it O
is O
unprecedented O
in O
the O
history O
of O
Lebanon B-GPE
, O
a O
crowd O
of O
such O
, O
uh O
, O
enormous O
size O
. O

The O
opposition O
today B-DATE
took O
to O
the O
streets O
, O
maybe O
this O
was O
the O
last O
option O
after O
it O
, O
uh O
, O
went O
to O
the O
dialogue O
table O
later O
for O
consultation O
. O

The O
roads O
were O
blocked O
and O
they O
took O
to O
the O
streets O
. O

The O
goal O
of O
the O
demonstration O
is O
change O
, O
reform O
, O
uh O
, O
changing O
the O
government O
. O

Will O
anything O
actually O
change O
in O
Lebanon B-GPE
after O
this O
demonstration O
, O
especially O
since O
the O
government O
is O
saying O
that O
it O
is O
staying O
, O
staying O
, O
staying O
? O

First B-ORDINAL
, O
no O
one O
called O
for O
the O
government O
to O
fall O
without O
justification O
. O

the O
first O
demands O
were O
an O
agreement O
to O
expand O
the O
government O
or O
modify O
it O
so O
it O
would O
become O
a O
national O
unity O
government O
. O

Um O
. O

His O
Excellency O
Speaker O
Nabih B-PERSON
Berri I-PERSON
has O
explained O
this O
matter O
and O
said O
, O
the O
matter O
does O
not O
depend O
on O
the O
resignation O
of O
the O
government O
, O
or O
changing O
the O
prime O
minister O
, O
or O
a O
new O
confidence O
. O

All O
that O
there O
is O
to O
it O
, O
is O
that O
the O
issue O
requires O
, O
uh O
, O
a O
national O
consensus O
during O
this O
fateful O
period O
in O
the O
history O
of O
Lebanon B-GPE
. O

And O
when O
these O
demands O
were O
met O
uh O
, O
with O
a O
categorical O
rejection O
, O
they O
were O
left O
with O
no O
option O
. O

There O
was O
no O
other O
way O
but O
to O
take O
to O
the O
street O
because O
the O
basis O
of O
democratic O
rule O
is O
that O
power O
derives O
from O
the O
people O
. O

Um O
. O

The O
people O
are O
the O
source O

authority O

therefore O
let O
us O
seek O
the O
people O

decision O

the O

that O
what O
he O
carries O

him O
is O
a O
plan O

he O
confirmed O
that O
the O

can O
not O
be O
spectators O
in O
a O
very O

is O
that O
Moussa B-PERSON
insists O

making O
a O
crack O

the O
wall O

the O
crisis O
; O
he O
considered O
that O
the O
door O
is O
open O
for O
meetings O
with O
all O
factions O
, O
because O
the O
movement O
aims O
at O
supporting O
all O
Lebanon B-GPE
, O
not O
just O
the O
government O
of O
Prime O
Minister O
Siniora B-PERSON
. O

National O
reconciliation O

as O
he O
views O
it O

is O
the O
basis O
and O
the O
starting O
point O
for O
any O
Arab O
action O
. O

The O
situation O
in O
Lebanon B-GPE
is O
most O
critical O
, O

And O
ah O
all O
Arab B-NORP
leaders O
and O
ah O
the O
joint O
Arab B-NORP
work O
in O
the O
framework O
of O
the B-ORG
Arab I-ORG

is O
trying O
ah O
, O
to O
deal O
with O
this O
situation O
with O
all O
cautiousness O
, O
all O
brotherhood O
, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
with O
all O
optimism O
, O
because O
Lebanon B-GPE
should O
not O
be O
an O
arena O
except O
for O
the O
Lebanese B-NORP
to O
progress O
, O
prove O
or O
consolidate O
their O
national O
unity O
, O
and O
go O
forward O
. O

A O
step O
that O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
seemed O
eager O
for O
the B-ORG
Arab I-ORG
League I-ORG
to O
welcome O
, O
even O
if O
his O
positions O
intersected O
with O
Moussa B-PERSON
in O
not O
calling O
this O
movement O
an O
initiative O
. O

While O
it O
seems O
that O
the O
government O
of O
Prime O
Minister O
Fouad B-PERSON
Siniora I-PERSON
receives O
notable O
Arab B-GPE
and O
international O
support O
, O
the O
parliamentary O
majority O

insisting O

at O

renews O
support O

Prime O

his O

from O

We O

give O
the O

more O
than O
it O
actually O
means O

I O
can O

there O

a O
candidate O

the O

has O
begun O
paving O
his O
way O
to O
the B-FAC
Elysee I-FAC
Palace I-FAC

The O
beginning O
was O
in O
the O
regions O
and O
among O
the O
classes O
that O
have O
been O
most O
harmed O
by O
his O
policies O
, O
the O
suburbs O
and O
their O
residents O
who O
descend O
from O
immigrants O
. O

But O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
policeman O
of O
France B-GPE
did O
not O
resort O
this O
time O
to O
his O
familiar O
vocabulary O
vis O
- O
a O
- O
vis O
the O
people O
of O
the O

Instead O
, O
he O
replaced O
it O
with O
the O
language O
of O
cooperation O
, O
fairness O
and O
the O
promise O
of O
tangible O
solutions O

Monthsaway O
away O
from O

it O
seems O
that O
the O
Interior O
Minister O
has O
chosen O
the O
most O
difficult O
thing O
to O
begin O
his O
campaign O
with O
. O

Nicolas B-PERSON
Sarkozy I-PERSON
welcomed O
to O
his O
ministry O
young O
people O
from O
the O

a O
step O
that O
was O
not O
lacking O
in O
significance O

Equal O
opportunities O
, O
identity O

work O

women O
in O
the O
poor O

all O
subjects O
that O
were O
discussed O
throughout O
an O
entire O
day O

Sarkozy B-PERSON
appeared O
flexible O
this O
time O
without O
losing O
his O
toughness O

stressing O
that O
France B-ORDINAL
will O
not O
accept O
values O
that O
are O
in O
conflict O

the O
values O
of O

I O
assure O
you O
that O

can O
not O
give O
you O
anything O
if O
you O
do O
not O
decide O
, O
by O
yourselves O

to O
improve O
your O
conditions O

Sarkozy B-PERSON

We O
came O
to O

our O

if O

were O
to O
be O
adopted O

that O
is O
our O
hope O

We O
are O
here O
for O

but O
this O
did O
not O
happen O

The O

Long O

the O
democracy O
that O

able O
to O
coexist O
well O
with O

had O
wished O
this O

under O
the O
slogan O
of O
What O
we O
say O

we O

perhaps O
with O

can O
repair O
his O

serious O

up O

Of O

Moussa B-PERSON

very O

on O
the O

and O
second B-ORDINAL
, O
what O

points O

Moussa B-PERSON
arrived O

at O
a O
time O
when O
the O
opposition O

violated O

comment O

these O

Ethiopia B-GPE

the O

It O
also O
denied O
sending O

From O
Turkey B-GPE
, O

Pope O
Benedict B-PERSON
XVI I-PERSON
began O
his O
first B-ORDINAL
visit O
to O
the O
lands O
of O
Islam B-ORG
in O
Ankara B-GPE
. O

The O
Supreme O
Pontiff O
received O
two B-CARDINAL
welcomes O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
official O
that O
was O
not O
lacking O
in O
hospitality O
, O
but O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
was O
popular O
and O
it O
was O
an O
angry O
one O
. O

The O
Pope O
met O
with O
the O
supreme O
religious O
authority O
in O
Turkey B-ORG
and O
called O
for O
a O
dialogue O
of O
civilizations O
. O

In O
spite O
of O
his O
attempts O
at O
distancing O
his O
visit O
from O
any O
political O
character O
, O
he O
nevertheless O
declared O
his O
support O
for O
Turkey B-GPE
's O
accession O
to O
the B-ORG
European I-ORG
Union I-ORG
. O

A O
noticeable O
change O
in O
his O
position O
did O
not O
alter O
the O
resentment O
of O
the O
Turkish B-GPE
street O
on O
account O
of O
his O
previous O
statements O
on O
Islam B-ORG
. O

Ankara B-FAC
Airport I-FAC
is O
the O
first O
Islamic B-NORP
soil O
on O
which O
Pope O
Benedict B-PERSON
XVI I-PERSON
sets O
foot O
since O
his O
ascension O
to O
the O
papal O
throne O
. O

In O
his O
reception O
, O
he O
found O
the O
Turkish B-NORP
Prime O
Minister O
, O
who O
postponed O
his O
trip O
to O
attend O
the O
NATO B-ORG
summit O
in O
Latvia B-GPE
so O
that O
the O
Pope O
would O
not O
seem O
as O
officially O
unwelcome O
as O
he O
is O
popularly O
unwelcome O
. O

But O
the O
diplomacy O
of O
welcomes O
does O
not O
hide O
the O
embarrassment O
of O
both O
sides O
at O
a O
visit O
laden O
with O
veiled O
political O
symbolism O
, O
including O
the O
symbol O
communicated O
by O
the O
Pope O
's O
first B-ORDINAL
activity O
. O

The O
visit O
to O
the O
mausoleum O
of O
the O
founder O
of O
modern O
Turkey B-GPE
, O
Kemal B-PERSON
Ataturk I-PERSON
, O
was O
a O
stance O
on O
the O
proposition O
of O
secularism O
, O
and O
words O
with O
religious O
significance O
written O
by O
the O
Pope O
in O
the O
mausoleum O
's O
golden O
visitors O
' O
book O
and O
a O
stamp O
that O
the O
Pope O
insisted O
on O
displaying O
in O
the O
plane O
that O
carried O
him O
to O
Turkey B-GPE
. O

This O
is O
not O
a O
political O
visit O
; O
it O
is O
a O
religious O
visit O
aiming O
at O
finding O
common O
ground O
for O
peace O
and O
deepening O
the O
dialogue O
. O

A O
dialogue O
between O
the O
various O
cultures O
and O
between O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
religions O
of O
Christianity B-ORG
and O
Islam B-ORG
. O

But O
politics O
has O
followed O
the O
Pope O
as O
it O
has O
preceded O
him O
. O

Erdogan B-PERSON
tried O
to O
ease O
the O
atmosphere O
by O
saying O
that O
the O
Pope O
's O
position O
on O
Turkey B-GPE
's O
accession O
to O
the B-ORG
European I-ORG
Union I-ORG
was O
contrary O
to O
his O
position O
when O
he O
was O
called O
Cardinal O
Ratzinger O
. O

The O
Pope O
said O
in O
reply O
to O
my O
question O
on O
Turkey B-GPE
's O
joining O
the B-ORG
European I-ORG
Union I-ORG
that O
he O
is O
not O
a O
politician O
but O
he O
supports O
this O
accession O
. O

But O
the O
change O
in O
positions O
did O
not O
change O
anything O
in O
the O
universal O
anger O
that O
is O
sweeping O
through O
the O
Turkish B-NORP
street O
. O

Thousands O
of O
Turks B-NORP
came O
out O
under O
the O
vigilant O
eyes O
of O
the O
security O
forces O
to O
reject O
the O
Pope O
's O
visit O
and O
to O
protest O
his O
failure O
to O
retract O
his O
statements O
about O
Islam B-ORG
. O

Several B-DATE
days I-DATE
after O
the O
armed O
confrontations O
between O
supporters O
of O
the O
Fatah B-ORG
and O
Hamas B-ORG
movements O
and O
the O
multiple O
violations O
of O
the O

, O
Prime O
Minister O
Ismail B-PERSON
Haniyeh I-PERSON
expressed O
the O
movement O
's O
readiness O
to O
begin O
a O
dialogue O
to O
form O
a O
government O
according O
to O
Palestinian B-NORP
premises O
and O
conditions O
, O
in O
order O
to O
contain O
the O
confrontations O
in O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
street O
. O

Uh O
, O
what O
is O
required O
, O
uh O
, O
also O
is O
dialogue O
, O
and O
if O
we O
can O
achieve O
a O
Palestinian B-NORP
understanding O
about O
a O
national O
unity O
government O
, O
this O
is O
the O
preferred O
option O
. O

But O
it O
's O
necessary O
to O
deal O
earnestly O
with O
this O
subject O
, O
so O
that O
it O
will O
in O
the O
end O
lead O
clearly O
to O
the O
basis O
of O
an O
agreement O
for O
a O
government O
that O
is O
capable O
of O
resolving O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
siege O
. O

It O
is O
noteworthy O
that O
the O
state O
of O
cautious O
calm O
prevailing O
over O
the B-GPE
West I-GPE
Bank I-GPE
and O
the O
Strip O
comes O
after O
violent O
confrontations O
that O
the O
city O
of O
Nablus B-GPE
saw O
today B-DATE
, O
which O
left O
nine B-CARDINAL
citizens O
injured O
, O
after O
which O
President O
Mahmoud B-PERSON

ordered O
the O
deployment O
of O
the O
security O
forces O
in O
the O
streets O
of O
the O
city O
to O
cordon O
it O
off O

In O
the O
absence O
of O
any O
political O
internal O
, O
uh O
, O
Palestinian B-NORP
, O
uh O
accord O
, O
the O
situation O
of O
internal O
tension O
will O
remain O
open O
to O
the O
likelihood O
of O
infighting O
even O
more O
than O
what O
we O
have O
already O
seen O
, O
in O
the O
next O
period O
. O

And O
any O
political O
escalation O
also O
, O
uh O
, O
uh O
, O
is O
likely O
to O
fuel O
the O
internal O
situation O
which O
is O
going O
towards O
infighting O
, O
as O
we O
saw O
in O
Gaza B-GPE
and O
as O
we O
saw O
in O
the B-GPE
West I-GPE
Bank I-GPE
, O
particularly O
, O
uh O
, O
uh O
, O
in O
Nablus B-GPE

Meanwhile O
, O
the B-ORG

Whereas O

Fatah B-ORG
for O
its O

that O
none O

Ecuador B-GPE

this O

the O

actually O
the O

I O
think O
that O
the O

, O

I O

, O
inspiration O

Of O

he O

face O

no O

and O
specifically O

to O
Hezbollah B-ORG
's O
Secretary O
General O
through O
Hajj B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
Al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Khalil I-PERSON
. O

In O
the O
context O
of O
his O
announcement O
there O
are O
two B-CARDINAL
important O
points O
: O

The O
first B-ORDINAL
point O
relates O
to O
the O
need O
to O
disarm O
the O
resistance O
, O
or O
an O
honor O
pact O
or O
a O
word O
of O
honor O
from O
Sayyed B-PERSON
Hassan I-PERSON
Nasrallah I-PERSON
that O
the O
resistance O
will O
be O
disarmed O
, O
and O
talking O
about O
the O
weapons O
of O
the O
resistance O
, O
specifically O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
Israeli B-NORP
aggression O
against O
, O
uh O
, O
Lebanon B-GPE
. O

He O
explicitly O
clarified O
, O
and O
also O
mentioned O
names O
, O
that O
there O
were O
direct O
mediations O
taking O
place O
between O
member O
of O
Parliament O
Saad B-PERSON
Hariri I-PERSON
and O
Hajj B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
Al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Khalil I-PERSON
. O

And O
he O
mentioned O
Hajj B-PERSON
Akram I-PERSON
Saad I-PERSON
as O
a O
mediator O
. O

He O
also O
mentioned O
Mr. O
Wissam B-PERSON
Al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Hassan I-PERSON
as O
a O
mediator O
from O
the B-ORG
Future I-ORG
Movement I-ORG
. O

He O
also O
discussed O
what O
was O
happening O
with O
the O
French B-NORP
proposal O
to O
stop O
the O
Israeli B-NORP
aggression O
, O
that O
it O
will O
proceed O
or O
a O
resolution O
will O
be O
issued O
by O
the O
Security O
Council O
under O
Chapter O
Seven B-CARDINAL
, O
and O
how O
they O
mostly O
rejected O
this O
. O

The O
outcome O
at O
the O
end O
of O
this O
press O
conference O
is O
the O
advice O
of O
Hajj B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
Al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Khalil I-PERSON
, O
the O
political O
aide O
to O
the O
Secretary O
General O
, O
that O
they O
should O
not O
play O
the O
role O
of O
disguising O
the O
facts O
. O

And O
these O
words O
are O
addressed O
to O
the B-ORG
Future I-ORG
Movement I-ORG
because O
if O
they O
were O
to O
play O
that O
role O
, O
there O
would O
be O
a O
successive O
revealing O
of O
a O
set O
of O
letters O
and O
documents O
that O
condem O
the B-ORG
Future I-ORG
Movement I-ORG
. O

The O
questions O
that O
were O
posed O
by O
the O
journalists O
dealt O
with O
the O
context O
of O
: O
to O
what O
extent O
can O
the O
response O
and O
the O
rebuttal O
to O
the O
response O
end O
? O

Hajj B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
Al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Khalil I-PERSON
answered O
that O
this O
talk O
is O
completely O
different O
, O
as O
are O
talks O
of O
a O
transitional O
government O
, O
talk O
about O
the O
government O
and O
about O
unity O
and O
about O
sitting O
together O
one B-CARDINAL
more O
time O
. O

And O
this O
was O
a O
question O
for O
Al B-ORG
- I-ORG
Alam I-ORG
channel I-ORG
about O
how O
there O
could O
be O
talk O
about O
another O
party O
in O
this O
way O
, O
as O
well O
as O
sitting O
with O
that O
party O
? O

He O
said O
: O
This O
is O
a O
different O
matter O
. O

But O
now O
he O
is O
explaining O
the O
contents O
of O
a O
statement O
made O
yesterday B-DATE
by O
the B-ORG
Future I-ORG
Movement I-ORG
following O
up O
on O
his O
statements O
to O
Al B-ORG
- I-ORG
Manar I-ORG
Television I-ORG
. O

Lebanese B-NORP
President O
Emile B-PERSON
Lahoud I-PERSON
demanded O
that O
the O
opposition O
voices O
who O
are O
calling O
for O
the O
overthrow O
of O
the O
Lebanese B-NORP
government O
demand O
the O
formation O
of O
a O
national O
unity O
government O
instead O
. O

Lahoud B-PERSON
maintained O
in O
an O
interview O
with O
the B-ORG
Abu I-ORG
Dhabi I-ORG
Channel I-ORG
, O
that O
he O
is O
the O
president O
of O
all O
the O
Lebanese B-NORP
, O
is O
entrusted O
with O
the O
constitution O
and O
that O
democracy O
in O
Lebanon B-GPE
is O
based O
on O
agreement O
, O
and O
in O
order O
to O
resolve O
the O
current O
crisis O
, O
the O
cabinet O
has O
to O
be O
based O
on O
agreement O
. O

A O
president O
of O
the O
republic O
in O
Lebanon B-GPE
has O
to O
be O
always O
the O
president O
of O
all O
the O
Lebanese B-NORP
, O
and O
this O
is O
what O
I O
have O
done O
ever O
since O
I O
was O
an O
army O
commander O
. O

The O
president O
of O
the O
republic O
is O
, O
ah O
, O
entrusted O
with O
the O
constitution O
, O

and O
the O
constitution O
is O
clear O
. O

The O
constitution O
says O
in O
its O
preamble O
, O
that O
there O
is O
no O
legitimate O
authority O
unless O
co-existence O
is O
present O
in O
the O
national O
charter O
. O

You O
have O
to O
know O
why O
this O
was O
done O
in O
the O
constitution O
. O

As O
you O
know O
Lebanon B-GPE
is O
an O
agreement O
- O
based O
democracy O
. O

Now O
if O
all O
the O
ministers O
from O
a O
certain O
group O
representing O
approximately B-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL
third I-CARDINAL
of O
Lebanon B-GPE
say O
that O
we O
do O
not O
want O
to O
take O
part O
in O
this O
cabinet O
anymore O
, O
this O
means O
that O
the O
legitimacy O
of O
the O
cabinet O
is O
null O
and O
void O
, O

and O
on O
this O
basis O
, O
what O
I O
say O
, O
is O
that O
before O
things O
deteriorate O
-- O
and O
they O
should O
not O
, O
and O
we O
will O
not O
let O
them O
deteriorate O
-- O
there O
has O
to O
be O
an O
agreement O
- O
based O
cabinet O
, O
national O
for O
all O
the O
Lebanese B-NORP
, O
so O
they O
resolve O
all O
issues O
, O
ah O
, O
especially O
after O
this O
war O
which O
Israel B-GPE
launched O
on O
Lebanon B-GPE
. O

Therefore O
I O
say O
that O
the O
only O
solution O
for O
us O
, O
is O
not O
to O
talk O
about O
overthrowing O
the O
government O
, O
but O
rather O
talk O
about O
forming O
a O
national O
government O
. O

The O
surprise O
victory O
of O
the O
leftist O
candidate O
Rafael B-PERSON
Correa I-PERSON
in O
the O
run O
- O
off O
presidential O
elections O
in O
Ecuador B-GPE
recalled O
the O
rise O
of O
the O
leftist O
tide O
in O
many O
countries O
in O
the O
Latin B-NORP
American I-NORP
states O
region O
. O

The O
victory O
of O
Correa B-PERSON
, O
who O
is O
the O
eighth B-ORDINAL
president O
of O
Ecuador B-GPE
in O
ten B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
will O
strengthen O
the O
campaign O
of O
his O
ally O
, O
Venezuelan B-NORP
President O
Hugo B-PERSON
Chavez I-PERSON
, O
who O
aims O
at O
establishing O
an O
alliance O
of O
the O
leftist O
governments O
facing O
the O
American B-NORP
influence O
in O
the O
region O
. O

The O
initial O
results O
that O
have O
been O
announced O
confirmed O
that O
Rafael B-PERSON
Correa I-PERSON
received O
sixty B-PERCENT
- I-PERCENT
eight I-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
of O
the O
total O
votes O
versus O
thirty B-PERCENT
- I-PERCENT
one I-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
for O
his O
competitor O
, O
the O
rightist O
candidate O
Alvaro B-PERSON
Noboa I-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
won O
the O
majority O
of O
votes O
in O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
round O
of O
the O
elections O
. O

While O
supporters O
of O
Correa B-PERSON
started O
to O
celebrate O
the O
victory O
in O
different O
areas O
of O
Ecuador B-GPE
, O
Alvaro B-PERSON
Noboa I-PERSON
, O
the O
richest O
man O
in O
the O
country O
, O
who O
is O
seeking O
to O
win O
the O
presidency O
position O
for O
the O
third B-ORDINAL
time O
, O
questioned O
the O
accuracy O
of O
these O
results O
. O

The O
winning O
candidate O
, O
Rafael B-PERSON
Correa I-PERSON
, O
who O
preceded O
the O
announcement O
of O
the O
final O
results O
, O
renewed O
his O
intention O
to O
call O
for O
forming O
a O
constitutional O
association O
that O
enjoys O
full O
authority O
, O
and O
opposed O
the O
currently O
stalled O
negotiations O
for O
reaching O
a O
free O
trade O
agreement O
with O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
. O

The O
winning O
president O
in O
these O
elections O
faces O
a O
difficult O
challenge O
to O
his O
ability O
to O
govern O
Ecuador B-GPE
for O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
four I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
as O
it O
is O
a O
politically O
unstable O
country O
that O
has O
overthrown O
many O
presidents O
: O
the O
last O
of O
them O
was O
Lucio B-PERSON
Gutierrez I-PERSON
, O
who O
dissolved O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
and O
appointed O
new O
judges O
who O
cancelled O
an O
arrest O
warrant O
against O
a O
former O
president O
accused O
of O
corruption O
. O

Good O
morning O
and O
good O
day O
. O

In O
principle O
it O
is O
final O
, O
and O
going O
into O
the O
streets O
, O
it O
has O
become O
a O
matter O
of O
hours O
, O
as O
one O
official O
in O
Hezbollah B-ORG
said O
. O

Actions O
are O
about O
to O
happen O
, O
they O
are O
actually O
imminent O
, O
after O
all O
preparations O
for O
them O
have O
been O
finalized O
, O
as O
stated O
by O
Ali B-PERSON
Qanso I-PERSON
, O
leader O
of O
the B-ORG
Syrian I-ORG
Social I-ORG
National I-ORG
Party I-ORG
. O

In O
principle O
also O
, O
all O
the O
political O
mediations O
which O
were O
widely O
talked O
about O
yesterday B-TIME
morning I-TIME
, O
were O
voided O
by O
nighttime B-TIME
, O
because O
the O
calculations O
of O
the O
minority O
or O
the O
opposition O
do O
not O
correspond O
at O
all O
with O
those O
of O
the O
majority O
or O
the O
loyalists O
. O

We O
are O
then O
at O
the O
threshold O
of O
street O
action O
, O
and O
this O
is O
what O
compelled O
the O
vice O
president O
of O
the B-ORG
Higher I-ORG
Shiite I-ORG
Council I-ORG
, O
Abdel B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Amir I-PERSON
Qabalan I-PERSON
to O
warn O
from O
going O
into O
the O
streets O
because O
there O
is O
harm O
and O
corruption O
in O
this O
action O
. O

This O
is O
also O
what O
drove O
President O
Fuad B-PERSON
Siniora I-PERSON
to O
warn O
about O
the O
prevalence O
of O
the O
overthrow O
logic O
over O
democratic O
logic O
. O

This O
also O
drove O
the O
Member O
of O
Parliament O
Saad B-PERSON
Hariri I-PERSON
to O
warn O
of O
the O
continuing O
series O
of O
assassinations O
, O
considering O
that O
the O
turn O
now O
is O
focused O
on O
two B-CARDINAL
: O
Walid B-PERSON
Jumblatt I-PERSON
, O
and O
himself O
personally O
. O

So O
here O
we O
are O
again O
in O
the O
phase O
of O
awaiting O
the O
winds O
of O
the O
storm O
. O

When O
will O
this O
storm O
blow O
, O
how O
, O
and O
where O
? O

and O
will O
it O
succeed O
as O
planned O
or O
as O
its O
executors O
plan O
, O
in O
rooting O
out O
the O
government O
of O
President O
Siniora B-PERSON
, O
or O
introducing O
the O
blocking O
third B-ORDINAL
into O
it O
? O

Or O
will O
this O
storm O
fail O
to O
change O
any O
of O
the O
conditions O
as O
the O
leaders O
of O
the O
majority O
maintain O
? O

And O
in O
this O
context O
, O
what O
about O
the O
fate O
of O
the B-ORG
International I-ORG
Court I-ORG
, O
and O
the O
presidency O
of O
the O
republic O
? O

Then O
again O
, O
what O
about O
the O
fate O
of O
resolution B-LAW
1701 I-LAW
, O
which O
it O
appears O
that O
everyone O
has O
forgotten O
or O
pretended O
to O
forget O
about O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
their O
internal O
preoccupations O
, O
and O
while O
directing O
the O
attention O
away O
from O
Israel B-GPE
's O
goals O
, O
ambitions O
, O
and O
wars O
to O
small O
internal O
wars O
? O

No O
clear O
features O
have O
appeared O
yet O
for O
the O
Jordanian B-NORP
initiative O
seeking O
a O
way O
out O
of O
the O
crisis O
between O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
sides O
of O
the B-ORG
Palestinian I-ORG
Authority I-ORG

Abbas B-PERSON

the O
realities O
in O
the O

warn O
of O

The O
features O
of O
the O
Jordanian B-NORP
initiative O
, O
which O
the O

have O
circulated O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
internal O
Palestinian B-NORP
struggle O
between O
the O
Fatah B-ORG

Hamas B-ORG
movements O

have O
not O

Whereas O
only O
Palestinian B-NORP
President O

an O
invitation O

the O
Jordanian B-NORP
capital O

Sunday I-DATE
, O
the O
Hamas B-ORG
movement O
announced O
its O
welcome O
to O
the O
Jordanian B-NORP
role O
, O
but O
it O
confirmed O
its O
position O
in O
which O
it O
considers O
the O
only O
way O
out O
of O
the O
crisis O
is O
a O
national O
unity O
government O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
the O

, O
and O
not O
according O
to O
American B-NORP
and O
Israeli B-NORP
measures O
, O
according O
to O
Hamas B-ORG
. O

The O
Hamas B-ORG
movement O
declared O
its O
position O
and O
will O
not O
change O
this O
position O
, O
that O
it O
wo O
n't O
accept O
these O
elections O
and O
the O
coup O
on O
the O
will O
of O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
people O

Ah O

the O
only O
alternative O
is O
the O

the B-LAW

Any O
context O
outside O

lead O

agitating O
the O
internal O
situation O

reaching O
a O
stage O
that O
has O
no O
ah O

good O
consequences O
. O

In O
its O
turn O
, O
the O
Fatah B-ORG
movement O
confirmed O
its O
insistence O
on O
the O
necessity O
to O
form O
a O
technocratic O
government O
that O
is O
internationally O
accepted O
and O
aims O
at O
removing O
the O

The O

no O
