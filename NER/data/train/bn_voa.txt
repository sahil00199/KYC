That O

Joe B-PERSON
O'Grossman I-PERSON
is O
a O
professor O
of O
constitutional O
law O
at O
Baltimore B-GPE
's O
Johns B-ORG
Hopkins I-ORG
University I-ORG
. O

He O
says O
that O
in O
this O
instance O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
probably O
felt O
the O
circumstances O
were O
such O
that O
they O
had O
no O
real O
alternative O
but O
to O
take O
the O
case O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
think O
they O
took O
the O
case O
because O
it O
seemed O
like O
it O
was O
such O
a O
important O
issue O
that O
it O
would O
be O
kind O
of O
unseemly O
for O
them O
to O
try O
to O
reject O
it O
out O
of O
hand O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
I O
think O
that O
Lawrence B-PERSON
Tribe I-PERSON
, O
the O
Harvard B-ORG
Law I-ORG
School I-ORG
professor O
who O
is O
arguing O
for O
Gore B-PERSON
tomorrow B-DATE
, O
is O
going O
to O
ask O
the O
court O
to O
hold O
the O
case O
, O
moot O
and O
dismiss O
it O
. O

And O
the O
Bush B-PERSON
campaign O
has O
brought O
the O
case O
, O
but O
recognizes O
that O
the O
particular O
issues O
that O
they O
brought O
to O
the O
court O
last B-DATE
week I-DATE
are O
really O
not O
very O
relevant O
anymore O
. O

, O
well O
, O
I O
know O
what O
they O
are O
going O
to O
do O
. O

They O
are O
going O
to O
try O
to O
broaden O
the O
case O
to O
make O
it O
a O
kind O
of O
a O
general O
referendum O
on O
election O
procedures O
. O

So O
, O
they O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
coronation O
, O
and O
the O
Gore B-PERSON
people O
at O
this O
point O
just O
want O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
this O
case O
, O
because O
they O
think O
they O
have O
a O
better O
chance O
in O
the O
Florida B-GPE
courts O
. O

Republicans B-NORP
generally O
support O
states O
' O
rights O
. O

So O
, O
does O
it O
appear O
somewhat O
ironic O
that O
they O
are O
going O
to O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
in O
this O
instance O
? O

No O
, O
I O
think O
first O
of O
all O
the O
notion O
that O
Republicans B-NORP
favor O
states O
' O
rights O
and O
Democrats B-NORP
oppose O
it O
, O
is O
much O
too O
simplistic O
. O

That O
's O
generally O
true O
, O
but O
it O
's O
only O
true O
on O
some O
issues O
, O
and O
in O
this O
case O
, O
you O
could O
argue O
that O
the O
Bush B-PERSON
people O
are O
going O
to O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
to O
preserve O
the O
right O
of O
Florida B-GPE
, O
to O
determine O
its O
own O
electors O
. O

So O
, O
there O
is O
a O
kind O
of O
states O
' O
rights O
issue O
there O
, O
but O
they O
need O
, O
or O
at O
least O
they O
once O
thought O
they O
needed O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
to O
endorse O
it O
. O

So O
it O
goes O
both O
ways O
. O

What O
are O
the O
justices O
likely O
looking O
for O
? O

Well O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

and O
I O
think O
they O
will O
be O
divided O
, O
I O
mean O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
they O
will O
be O
unanimous O
. O

Obviously O
, O
they O
would O
like O
to O
be O
able O
to O
achieve O
some O
kind O
of O
resolution O
of O
the O
case O
. O

American O
election O
laws O
are O
often O
challenged O
at O
the O
local O
level O
and O
sometimes O
in O
the O
federal O
courts O
, O
but O
this O
is O
certainly O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
we O
have O
had O
a O
Supreme B-ORG
Court I-ORG
challenge O
over O
presidential O
election O
. O

So O
, O
there O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
new O
law O
here O
to O
be O
made O
or O
at O
least O
law O
that O
has O
n't O
been O
made O
yet O
. O

It O
's O
possible O
that O
if O
the O
court O
accepts O
the O
invitation O
of O
the O
Bush B-PERSON
campaign O
, O
at O
least O
as O
it O
is O
expressed O
in O
the O
briefs O
they O
submitted O
yesterday B-DATE
, O
that O
the O
court O
will O
in O
the O
sense O
, O
take O
the O
entire O
issue O
, O
even O
- O
not O
just O
the O
specific O
questions O
that O
it O
was O
asked O
last B-DATE
week I-DATE
and O
try O
to O
resolve O
the O
question O
. O

For O
example O
, O
if O
the O
court O
says O
it O
is O
clearly O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
legislature O
of O
the O
state O
of O
Florida B-GPE
can O
determine O
for O
itself O
who O
its O
electors O
will O
be O
, O
that O
will O
pretty O
much O
end O
the O
case O
, O
because O
that O
's O
what O
the O
legislature O
already O
plans O
to O
do O
, O
and O
that O
does O
n't O
mean O
the O
Gore B-PERSON
people O
wo O
n't O
keep O
trying O
, O
because O
ultimately O
Congress B-ORG
has O
to O
decide O
and O
only O
Congress B-ORG
can O
decide O
if O
there O
are O
competing O
slates O
of O
electors O
submitted O
, O
which O
slate O
to O
accept O
. O

Alzheimer O

give O
a O
progress O
report O
this B-DATE
week I-DATE
in O
the O
journal O
Nature B-WORK_OF_ART
. O

The O
vaccine O
has O
only O
been O
tested O
in O
mice O
that O
have O
been O
bred O
to O
have O
a O
form O
of O
Alzheimer O
's O
Disease O
very O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
humans O
. O

According O
to O
University B-ORG
of I-ORG
Toronto I-ORG
researcher O
David B-PERSON
Westaway I-PERSON
, O
another O
team O
of O
scientists O
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
took O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
step O
toward O
an O
Alzheimer O
's O
vaccine O
. O

That O
team O
injected O
a O
small O
amount O
of O
amyloid O
protein O
, O
which O
accumulates O
in O
brains O
of O
Alzheimer O
's O
patients O
and O
injected O
it O
in O
the O
mice O
's O
abdomens O
. O

The O
injection O
prompted O
the O
animals O
' O
immune O
systems O
to O
kick O
in O
and O
clean O
up O
the O
amyloid O
deposits O
in O
the O
rodents O
' O
brains O
. O

But O
those O
mice O
never O
had O
any O
difficulties O
with O
learning O
and O
memory O
. O

In O
Dr. O
Westaway B-PERSON
's O
view O
, O
this O
made O
the O
vaccine O
sort O
of O
pointless O
, O
since O
learning O
and O
memory O
problems O
are O
a O
hallmark O
of O
Alzheimer O
's O
Disease O
. O

So O
his O
research O
team O
decided O
to O
test O
a O
vaccine O
in O
mice O
with O
Alzheimer O
's O
more O
like O
that O
seen O
in O
many O
humans O
. O

Now O
normally O
Alzheimer O
's O
Disease O
might O
have O
this O
strong O
deficit O
in O
learning O
and O
memory O
, O
actually O
in O
our O
experiments O
the O
ability O
to O
navigate O
around O
a O
small O
tank O
of O
water O
using O
cues O
pinned O
up O
on O
the O
wall O
of O
the O
testing O
room O
, O
and O
once O
we O
started O
immunizing O
the O
mice O
against O
the O
Alzheimer O
Disease O
peptides O
then O
the O
performance O
showed O
a O
dramatic O
improvement O
such O
as O
they O
came O
very O
close O
to O
the O
performance O
of O
regular O
mice O
that O
have O
not O
been O
genetically O
engineered O
to O
resemble O
Alzheimer O
's O
Disease O
. O

A O
second B-ORDINAL
Alzheimer O
's O
vaccine O
experiment O
was O
also O
reported O
in O
the O
journal O
Nature B-WORK_OF_ART
by O
a O
group O
of O
University B-ORG
of I-ORG
South I-ORG
Florida I-ORG
scientists O
in O
Tampa B-GPE
. O

In O
a O
third B-ORDINAL
published O
paper O
researchers O
formally O
described O
how O
they O
genetically O
engineered O
a O
mouse O
model O
of O
Alzheimer O
's O
similar O
to O
the O
human O
disease O
, O
complete O
with O
memory O
and O
learning O

Paul B-PERSON
Chapman I-PERSON
of O
the B-ORG

in O
Wales B-GPE
, O
wrote O
an O
article O
in O
the O
magazine O
commenting O
on O
the O
developments O
. O

We O
all O
know O
we O
've O
got O
a O
long O
way O
to O
go O
before O
we O
have O
a O
cure O
for O
Alzheimer O
's O
Disease O
, O
but O
in O
order O
to O
get O
there O
we O
need O
to O
have O
confidence O
that O
we O
understand O
the O
disease O
and O
that O
we O
have O
what O
we O
call O
a O
model O
system O
for O
predicting O
whether O
these O
treatments O
will O
work O
. O

And O
the O
fact O
that O
these O
papers O
are O
now O
showing O
us O
that O
behaviorally O
these O
models O
do O
what O
humans O
do O
, O
that O
is O
they O
behave O
more O
poorly O
as O
they O
age O
if O
they O
have O
Alzheimer O
's O
genes O
, O
and O
that O
these O
treatments O
can O
reverse O
that O
, O
it O
just O
means O
we O
have O
that O
much O
more O
confidence O
these O
treatments O
will O
work O
in O
humans O
. O

In O

Of O

the O
book O
is O
a O
very O

it O

we O

It O
helps O
, O
but O
it O
's O
not O
necessary O
. O

Some O
filmmakers O

performers O
used O
golf O
as O
a O
setting O
for O
broad O
comedy O
with O
potential O
appeal O
both O
inside O

The O
1996 B-DATE

placed O

that O
some O

consider O

Golf O
can O
be O
a O
very O

game O

So O
, O
any O

I O
guess O
would O
understand O
that O
gag O
in O

And O
anyone O

We O
stressed O

Mr. O

only O

would O
have O
legitimate O
international O
authority O

There O
had O

reports O
the O
Palestinians B-NORP
might O
accept O
an O

several O

not O

The O
Palestinians B-NORP
are O
urging O
the B-ORG

adopt O
a O

resolution O
that O

send O
2000 B-CARDINAL

the B-GPE
West I-GPE

Backers O

the O
resolution O
say O
the O

provide O

The B-GPE

both O

It O

our O

this O

The O

open O

toughen O

The B-ORG
House I-ORG

Representatives I-ORG
is O
expected O
to O
vote O
on O
the O
measure O
next B-DATE

Mr. O
Clinton B-PERSON
says O
he O
will O
withhold O
final O
judgment O
until O
he O
sees O
details O
of O
the O
plan O
, O
which O
Members O
of O
Congress B-ORG
hammered O
out O
Thursday B-DATE
night B-TIME
, O
but O
he O
tells O
reporters O
that O
if O
the O
deal O
was O
what O
it O
appears O
to O
be O
, O
the O
lawmakers O
made O
a O
big O
mistake O
. O

It O
looks O
like O
it O
eases O
the O
embargo O
on O
food O
and O
medicine O
, O
but O
it O
probably O
does O
n't O
very O
much O
because O
it O
does O
n't O
provide O
any O
financing O
credits O
, O
which O
we O
give O
to O
other O
poor O
countries O
, O
whereas O
it O
definitely O
restricts O
the O
ability O
of O
the O
executive O
branch O
to O
increase O
people O
- O
to O
- O
people O
contacts O
between O
Americans B-NORP
and O
Cubans B-NORP
. O

The O
agreement O
which O
is O
part O
of O
a O
larger O
foreign O
bill O
, O
came O
after O
more B-DATE
than I-DATE
a I-DATE
year I-DATE
of O
political O
warfare O
and O
bargaining O
over O
the O
always O
sensitive O
subject O
of O
Cuba B-GPE
. O

The O
measure O
would O
allow O
American B-NORP
food O
and O
medicine O
to O
be O
sold O
there O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
in O
close B-DATE
to I-DATE
40 I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

It O
also O
applies O
to O
four B-CARDINAL
other O
nations O
where O
trade O
has O
been O
restricted O
, O
Iran B-GPE
, O
Sudan B-GPE
, O
Libya B-GPE
and O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
, O
but O
Cuban B-NORP

American I-NORP
House B-ORG
Members O
who O
fiercely O
oppose O
anything O
that O
might O
ease O
pressure O
on O
President O
Castro B-PERSON
demanded O
concessions O
. O

So O
, O
as O
Mr. O
Clinton B-PERSON
noted O
, O
the O
plan O
bars O
American B-NORP
banks O
from O
financing O
the O
food O
sales O
, O
which O
means O
Havana B-GPE
would O
have O
to O
pay O
cash O
or O
obtain O
credits O
from O
third B-ORDINAL
countries O
. O

Another O
part O
of O
the O
legislation O
would O
tighten O
restrictions O
on O
American B-NORP
travel O
to O
Cuba B-GPE
. O

The O
Castro B-PERSON
government O
has O
already O
rejected O
the O
deal O
, O
saying O
it O
will O
not O
buy O
anything O
under O
these O
terms O
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
the O
proposal O
supporters O
call O
it O
an O
opening O
to O
Cuba B-GPE
and O
an O
important O
shift O
in O
policy O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
leading O

, O
the B-ORG
American I-ORG
Farm I-ORG

describes O
it O
as O
a O
positive O
first B-ORDINAL
step O
and O
much O
better O
than O
current O

It O
appears O
Congress B-ORG

scientists O
have O
long O
been O
puzzled O
by O
the O
question O

which O

develop O

why O
. O

We O
know O
that O
the O
complications O
are O
directly O
related O

a O
couple O
of O
things O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
is O
how O
long O
you O
've O
had O
the O
diabetes O
, O
how O
well O
you O
've O
been O
controlled O

it O

clear O
that O
people O
with O
the O

level O

control O
of O
their O
glucose O
, O
same O
duration O
of O
the O
diabetes O
differ O
dramatically O
in O
their O
susceptibility O
to O
these O
complications O
that O
are O
so O
devastating O
. O

Dr. O
Levi B-PERSON
says O
one B-CARDINAL
third I-CARDINAL

insulin O

ends O
up O

kidney O
failure O
and O
80 B-PERCENT

Scientists O

there O
must O
be O
something O
different O
about O
the O
genetic O
make O
- O
up O
of O
diabetics O
who O
develop O
complications O
; O
and O
that O
difference O
may O
have O
to O
do O
with O
haptoglobin O
, O
a O
protein O
whose O
function O
is O
to O
mop O
up O

The O
free O

Andrew B-PERSON

there O

he O

produce O

it O

is O
transplanting O

It O
works O

The O
stimulating O
brain O
protein O
his O
team O
used O
is O
called O
GDNF O
. O

Previous O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
GDNF O
keeps O
dopamine O
cells O
healthy O
but O
the O
problem O
has O
been O
getting O
it O
to O
the O
brain O
. O

As O
a O
defense O
, O
the O
brain O
's O
blood O
vessels O
prevent O
most O
compounds O
from O
entering O
from O
the O
blood O
stream O
making O
it O
difficult O
to O
design O
a O
Parkinson O

drug O
. O

To O
overcome O
this O
, O
Mr. O
Codover B-PERSON

team O
injected O
a O
gene O
to O
make O
GDNF O
right O
into O
the O
monkey O

the O
gene O
, O
Louisiane B-ORG
University I-ORG
researchers O
devised O
an O
HIV O
virus O
stripped O
of O
its O
infecting O
machinery O
. O

When O
they O
injected O
the O
altered O
virus O
into O
brains O
of O
aging O
animals O
with O
early O
Parkinson O
's O
it O
conveyed O
the O
attached O
GDNF O
gene O
efficiently O
, O
causing O
dopamine O
cells O
to O
produce O
the O
rescue O
protein O
on O
site O
. O

When O
we O
delivered O
GDNF O
via O
gene O
therapy O
in O
these O
aged O
monkeys O
we O
were O
able O
to O
completely O
reverse O
all O
the O
cellular O
changes O
, O
degenerative O
changes O
that O
are O
seen O
in O
aged O
monkeys O
as O
they O
relate O
to O
Parkinson O
's O
Disease O
. O

The O
researchers O
report O
in O
the O
journal O
Science B-WORK_OF_ART
that O
the O
gene O
therapy O
also O
restored O
coordinated O
movement O
in O
young O
monkeys O
in O
which O
Parkinson O
's O
was O
chemically O
induced O
. O

The O
benefits O
of O
the O
treatment O
appear O
permanent O
or O
at O
least O
very O
long O
- O
lasting O
as O
GDNF O
genes O
continually O
produce O
the O
rescue O
protein O
. O

Mr. O
Codover B-PERSON
says O
that O
in O
people O
, O
it O
would O
be O
tested O
as O
preventive O
therapy O
rather O
than O
one O
for O
existing O
symptoms O
. O

Most O
current O
clinical O
trials O
in O
Parkinson O
's O
Disease O
are O
directed O
towards O
symptomatic O
therapy O
or O
towards O
more O
advanced O
patients O
. O

This O
type O
of O
therapy O
is O
directed O
towards O
more O
early O
patients O
with O
the O
emphasis O
on O
preventing O
the O
progression O
of O
the O
disease O
rather O
than O
replacing O
lost O
neurons O
or O
more O
symptomatic O
types O
of O
benefits O

In O

Carolinska B-ORG

neuroscientist O
Lars B-PERSON
Olson I-PERSON
says O
if O
gene O
delivery O
works O
well O
in O
people O
, O
it O
would O
be O
the O
best O
Parkinson O
's O
treatment O
yet O
. O

It O
would O
be O
better O
because O
you O
would O
n't O
have O
to O
take O
medication O
and O
you O
would O
n't O
have O
to O
do O
cell O
transplantation O
either O
. O

It O
might O
be O
a O
treatment O
that O
you O
would O
have O
to O
do O
only O
once O
or O
perhaps O
a O
few O
times O
during O
life O
with O
the O
illness O
. O

Mr. O
Olson B-PERSON
says O
the O
treatment O
might O
also O
be O
applied O
to O
other O
brain O
diseases O
in O
which O
nerve O
cells O
degenerate O
, O
but O
he O
warns O
of O
a O
major O
hurdle O
in O
assuring O
patients O
get O
the O
proper O
dose O
of O
gene O
therapy O
because O
too O
much O
is O
bad O
. O

If O
you O
over O
- O
stimulate O
other O
neighboring O
dopamine O
neurons O
you O
might O
get O
side O
effects O
similar O
to O
some O
of O
the O
symptoms O
seen O
in O
schizophrenia O
for O
instance O
. O

For O
use O
in O
patients O
one O
would O
like O
to O
have O
a O
system O
where O
the O
activity O
of O
the O
delivered O
gene O
could O
be O
controlled O
. O

It O

who O

something O

an O
enigmatic O
presence O
in O
the O
Russian B-NORP
political O
scene O
since O
he O
took O
office O
at O
the B-DATE
beginning I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
year I-DATE
2000 I-DATE
, O
is O
apparently O
under O
siege O
yet O
again O
by O
revelations O
that O
the O
Russians B-NORP
might O
possibly O
have O
been O
able O
to O
rescue O
those O
trapped O
sailors O
in O
the O
Kursk B-PRODUCT
submarine O
because O
some O
of O
them O
evidently O
survived O
and O
it O
's O
apparent O
that O
the O
Russian B-NORP
military O
suppressed O
information O
about O
what O
had O
happened O
or O
even O
distorted O
it O
, O
and O
was O
singularly O
slow O
in O
taking O
up O
offers O
of O
assistance O
from O
the O
Norwegians B-NORP
and O
the O
British B-NORP
to O
help O
. O

What O
impact O
do O
you O
think O
this O
new O
revelation O
has O
on O
Putin B-PERSON
's O
political O
stature O
? O

Oh O
, O
I O
think O
it O
is O
another O
step O
in O
a O
diminution O
of O
Putin B-PERSON
. O

I O
think O
a O
number O
of O
things O
have O
happened O
; O

His O
attempt O
to O
restore O
the O
image O
of O
Russia B-GPE
as O
a O
great O
power O
has O
, O
I O
think O
backfired O
generally O
. O

he O
plunged O
Milosevic B-PERSON
long O
after O
it O
was O
clear O
that O
he O
was O
finished O
. O

He O
has O
tried O
to O
form O
a O
strategic O
relationship O
with O
China B-GPE
and O
India B-GPE
, O
but O
this O
I O
think O
has O
reflected O
in O
a O
much O
more O
dramatic O
way O
, O
the O
weakness O
of O
Putin B-PERSON
. O

After O
all O
, O
you O
've O
got O
to O
remember O
that O
when O
the O
Kursk O
went O
down O
, O
he O
was O
on O
vacation O
in O
the B-LOC
Black I-LOC
Sea I-LOC
and O
did O
n't O
bother O
even O
to O
come O
back O
to O
Moscow B-GPE
, O
let O
alone O
going O
to O
Mermonsk B-GPE
at O
the O
scene O
of O
the O
disaster O
and O
they O
held O
back O
for O
days B-DATE
before O
they O
requested O
help O
from O
Norwegian B-NORP
and O
British B-NORP
experts O
and O
those O
kind O
of O
thing O
, O
and O
I O
think O
that O
there O
is O
a O
sense O
that O
it O
may O
have O
contributed O
to O
the O
disaster O
. O

Tom B-PERSON
, O
what O
's O
the O
thinking O
in O
the O
administration O
of O
Putin B-PERSON
's O
performance O
so O
far O
? O

Very O
disappointing O
. O

Putin B-PERSON
, O
it O
's O
clear O
he O
is O
no O
new O
style O
Democrat B-NORP
, O
to O
put O
it O
mildly O
. O

This O
is O
a O
man O
who O
still O
behaves O
like O
a O
KGB B-ORG
operator O
rather O
than O
a O
... O
which O
, O
of O
course O
, O
he O
was O
. O

Yeah O
, O
for O
many O
, O
many O
years O
at O
a O
high O
level O
, O
than O
a O
President O
of O
a O
country O
trying O
to O
grapple O
with O
democracy O
. O

I O
think O
the O
Clinton B-PERSON
administration O
it O
was O
hopeful O
for O
Boris B-PERSON
Yeltsin I-PERSON
and O
then O
it O
got O
disappointed O
in O
Yeltsin B-PERSON
and O
then O
they O
thought O
that O
reluctantly O
Mr. O
Putin B-PERSON
was O
a O
man O
that O
they O
could O
do O
business O
with O
, O
to O
coin O
former O
Prime O
Minister O
of O
Britain B-GPE
Margaret B-PERSON
Thatcher I-PERSON
's O
phrase O
about O
Mikhail B-PERSON
Gorbachov I-PERSON
, O
but O
Putin B-PERSON
is O
disappointing O
the O
United B-GPE
States I-GPE
government O
. O

They O
wo O
n't O
say O
that O
of O
course O
, O
but O
he O
has O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
disappointment O
, O
and O
I O
agree O
with O
Joe B-PERSON
, O
I O
think O
these O
latest O
revelations O
that O
23 B-CARDINAL
sailors O
on O
the O
Kursk B-PRODUCT
survived O
several O
days O
and O
theoretically O
might O
have O
been O
saved O
, O
had O
the O
Russians B-NORP
gotten O
off O
the O
dime O
and O
asked O
for O
help O
sooner O
, O
I O
think O
are O
devastating O
. O

And O
David B-PERSON
, O
I O
think O
it O
's O
important O
the O
views O
that O
I O
think O
is O
gaining O
headway O
in O
the O
Administration O
and O
voiced O
generally O
is O
that O
Putin B-PERSON
is O
a O
bureaucrat O
and O
he O
runs O
the O
government O
in O
a O
bureaucratic O
kind O
of O
way O
and O
that O
it O
has O
no O
chance O
whatever O
of O
rebuilding O
the O
Russian B-NORP
economy O
and O
the O
Russian B-NORP
political O
stability O
, O
and O
that O
a O
continuing O
decline O
appears O
to O
be O
in O
the O
cards O
for O
Russia B-GPE
under O
his O
leadership O
. O

He O

that O

lack O

the O
biggest O
problem O

She O
says O
it O
happens O
all O
the O

that O
she O
loses O

because O
they O
do O

have O
enough O

The O
Ecuadorian B-NORP

resemble O
US B-GPE
coins O
in O
an O
effort O
to O
provide O
more O

it O

some O
time O

reach O
all O
areas O

in O

not O

Ecuador B-GPE

crisis O
atmosphere O
characterized O

She O
says O
the O
immediate O
effect O
of O
the O
dollarization O
has O
been O
the O
stabilization O
of O
the O

. O

She O
says O
1998 B-DATE

1999 B-DATE
were O
years B-DATE

which O
Ecuador B-GPE
suffered O
the O
worst O
economic O

During O

she O

the O

went O
from O
just B-CARDINAL
over I-CARDINAL
6,000 I-CARDINAL
to O
the O

to O
almost B-CARDINAL
25,000 I-CARDINAL
to O
the O

. O

Maria B-PERSON
Delapasvela I-PERSON
says O
conducting O
business O
in O
Ecuador B-GPE
had O
become O
a O
real O
challenge O
as O
factory O
and O
storeowners O
needed O
to O
keep O
an O
eye O
on O
currency O
fluctuation O
almost O
on O
an O
hourly B-TIME
basis O
in O
order O
to O

their O

. O

She O
says O
inflation O
is O
now O
on O
the O
decline O
and O
bank O
deposits O
are O
increasing O
. O

The O
transition O
to O
dollars O
was O
eased O
somewhat O
by O
a O
sharp O
increase O
in O
oil O
prices O
in O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
which O
allowed O
oil O
- O
producing O
Ecuador B-GPE
to O
buy O
plenty O
of O
dollars O
on O
the O
international O
market O
, O
but O
Maria B-PERSON
Delapasvela I-PERSON
says O
now O
is O
the O
time O
to O
start O
thinking O
about O
what O
happens O
when O
the O
situation O
changes O
. O

She O
asks O
what O
will O
happen O
when O
oil O
prices O
go O
back O
down O
and O
the O
country O
can O
no O
longer O
bring O
in O
sufficient O
dollars O
to O
sustain O
its O
economy O
. O

The O
Ecuadorian B-NORP
economist O
says O
now O
is O
the O
time O
for O
the O
government O
to O
implement O
fiscal O
reforms O
and O
to O
stimulate O
competitiveness O
and O
diversification O
in O
the O
economy O
. O

She O
says O
the O
Nobora B-PERSON
government O
is O
rightfully O
proud O
of O
the O
immediate O
short O
- O
term O
effects O
of O
its O
dollarization O
policy O
, O
but O
that O
it O
needs O
to O
concentrate O
on O
the O
medium O
and O
long O
- O
term O
outlook O
. O

She O
says O
, O
unless O
the O
government O
develops O
a O
plan O
soon O
to O
address O
Ecuador B-GPE
's O
fundamental O
structural O
problems O
, O
the O
use O
of O
the O
US B-GPE
dollar O
as O
a O
medium O
of O
exchange O
will O
not O
be O
enough O
to O
keep O
the O
country O
's O
economy O
healthy O
. O

The O
experiment O
in O
Ecuador B-GPE
is O
being O
watched O
closely O
not O
only O
by O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
, O
which O
receives O
a O
certain O
benefit O
from O
the O
increased O
demand O
for O

, O
but O
by O
other O
nations O
in O
the O
region O
. O

The O
concept O
of O
dollarization O
has O
been O
discussed O
from O
Argentina B-GPE
to O
Mexico B-GPE
in O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
few I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

Some O
US B-GPE
economists O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
had O
viewed O
Ecuador B-GPE
as O
a O
poor O
place O
to O
test O
the O
idea O
since O
its O
economy O
is O
still O
burdened O
by O
heavy O
external O
debt O
and O
its O
export O
sector O
is O
relatively O
undeveloped O
. O

Still O
, O
as O
one B-CARDINAL
observer O
puts O
it O
, O
officials O
in O
some O
nations O
may O
conclude O
that O
if O
dollarization O
can O
work O
here O
in O
Ecuador B-GPE
, O
it O
can O
work O
anywhere O
