There O
are O
many O
many O
multifarious O
causes O
leading O
to O
the O
rise O
of O
a O
powerful O
country O
: O
institutional O
, O
cultural O
, O
and O
scientific O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
keep O
them O
clearly O
separate O
. O

But O
there O
is O
one O
point O
. O

It O
is O
always O
the O
new O
rising O
powers O
with O
larger O
population O
that O
replace O
the O
former O
powers O
with O
smaller O
population O
. O

As O
it O
is O
from O
Portugal B-GPE
to O
Spain B-GPE
, O
Holland B-GPE
, O
then O
Britain B-GPE
and O
France B-GPE
, O
then O
Germany B-GPE
, O
Japan B-GPE
and O
Russia B-GPE
, O
and O
then O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
. O

When O
, O
in O
one O
period O
, O
productivity O
develops O
to O
a O
certain O
level O
and O
productivity O
per O
person O
reaches O
an O
utmost O
, O
population O
, O
territory O
, O
and O
resources O
then O
play O
a O
decisive O
role O
. O

Because O
anything O
can O
be O
learned O
, O
but O
population O
ca O
n't O
be O
learned O
and O
territory O
ca O
n't O
be O
learned O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
population O
is O
not O
a O
sufficient O
condition O
, O
but O
it O
is O
definitely O
a O
necessary O
condition O
for O
becoming O
a O
powerful O
country O
. O

Only O
when O
the O
conditions O
of O
other O
aspects O
have O
been O
all O
met O
does O
population O
then O
become O
a O
huge O
momentum O
and O
not O
a O
burden O
. O

I O
dare O
not O
say O
that O
the O
next O
superpower O
to O
replace O
the O
US B-GPE
will O
be O
China B-GPE
, O
but O
I O
do O
dare O
say O
that O
if O
there O
is O
a O
country O
that O
can O
replace O
the O
US B-GPE
to O
become O
the O
new O
superpower O
, O
it O
definitely O
will O
be O
a O
country O
with O
a O
population O
larger O
than O
that O
of O
the O

the O

made O

as O

Sadr B-GPE

Everyone O
knows O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
is O
poor O
. O

Every O
year O
China B-GPE
assists O
with O
such O
a O
great O
amount O
of O
grain O
, O
crude O
oil O
, O
and O
so O
many O
light O
industrial O
products O
. O

From O
this O
we O
can O
see O
the O
degree O
to O
which O
agriculture O
and O
basic O
industries O
in O
this O
country O
have O
been O
reduced O
. O

But O
for O
North B-GPE
Korean I-GPE
athletes O
, O
although O
every O
one O
of O
them O
looks O
very O
skinny O
, O
their O
energy O
is O
no O
less O
than O
that O
of O
our O
athletes O
, O
who O
are O
provided O
with O
three O
scientifically O
formulated O
meals O
a O
day O
. O

A O
women O
's O
soccer O
match O
is O
now O
being O
broadcasted O
live O
. O

Looking O
at O
the O
speed O
and O
fight O
of O
the O
North B-GPE
Korean I-GPE
girls O
, O
I O
basically O
already O
know O
the O
outcome O
of O
this O
match O
. O

Of O
course O
the O
soccer O
ball O
is O
round O
, O
and O
anything O
is O
possible O
, O
but O
to O
be O
able O
to O
excel O
under O
such O
repression O
is O
almost O
an O
impossible O
mission O
. O

I O
have O
been O
thinking O
about O
what O
makes O
North B-GPE
Korean I-GPE
athletes O
so O
full O
of O
energy O
, O

Though O
each O
of O
them O
looks O
sallow O
, O
when O
in O
a O
real O
fight O
, O
let O
alone O
China B-GPE
, O
they O
are O
even O
no O
less O
strong O
-LRB- O
physically O
-RRB- O
than O
the O
European B-NORP
teams O
. O

It O
suddenly O
occurred O
to O
me O
that O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
is O
rich O
in O
Korean B-GPE
ginseng O
. O

There O
is O
n't O
enough O
rice O
, O
but O
they O
can O
mix O
it O
with O
ginseng O
for O
food O
. O

Although O
your O
stomach O
may O
be O
not O
satisfied O
with O
it O
, O
the O
energy O
your O
body O
gets O
is O
surely O
not O
something O
three O
meals O
of O
braised O
pork O
in O
brown O
sauce O
can O
compare O
. O

[] O
I O
left O
Chengdu O
with O
great O
excitement O
, O
accompanied O
by O
Xiao O
Zhao O
, O
my O
friend O
's O
driver O
. O

[] O
Xiao O
Zhao O
is O
a O
Chengdu O
local O
resident O
, O
and O
has O
often O
driven O
visitors O
to O
Jiuzhai O
and O
Huanglong O
to O
tour O
on O
an O
average O
of O
over O
ten O
trips O
a O
year O
; O
hence O
he O
is O
very O
familiar O
with O
the O
routes O
and O
the O
environment O
. O

[] O
The O
total O
distance O
between O
Chengdu O
and O
Jiuzhai O
is O
over O
400 O
km O
, O
and O
it O
takes O
six O
to O
seven O
hours O
. O

To O
get O
there O
within O
a O
day O
would O
be O
too O
rushed O
and O
exhausting O
, O
and O
the O
body O
might O
not O
adjust O
well O
to O
the O
area O
's O
high O
altitude O
while O
touring O
Jiuzhai O
the O
next O
day O
. O

[] O
If O
the O
trip O
is O
divided O
into O
two O
days O
, O
not O
only O
would O
it O
be O
much O
safer O
, O
there O
would O
also O
be O
more O
time O
to O
make O
brief O
stopovers O
at O
tourist O
spots O
and O
ancient O
towns O
along O
the O
way O
. O

[] O
In O
Xiao O
Zhao O
's O
words O
, O
the O
process O
is O
also O
very O
important O
, O
ah O
? O

[] O
Even O
though O
I O
wanted O
to O
reunite O
with O
my O
parents O
, O
who O
had O
already O
arrived O
in O
Jiuzhai O
ealier O
, O
I O
still O
accepted O
Xiao O
's O
careful O
arrangement O
with O
pleasure O
. O

[] O
According O
to O
the O
plan O
, O
the O
first O
day O
's O
route O
was O
from O
Dujianyan O
to O
Wenchuan O
, O
and O
we O
stayed O
overnight O
in O
Maoxian O
. O

[] O
We O
continued O
to O
forge O
ahead O
the O
next O
day O
, O
passing O
through O
Diexi O
Haizi O
, O
Mao'ergai O
, O
Songpan O
, O
and O
finally O
arrived O
at O
Jiuzhaigou O
and O
Huanglong O
scenic O
areas O
. O

In O
the O
past O
, O
China B-GPE
's O
wealth O
was O
entirely O
state O
assets O
or O
collective O
assets O
. O

It O
all O
belonged O
to O
the O
ordinary O
people O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
when O
the O
" O
elite O
" O
first O
began O
to O
clamor O
for O
" O
reform O
" O
, O
wealth O
was O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
ordinary O
people O
and O
" O
reform O
" O
was O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
" O
elite O
. O
" O

After O
reforms O
here O
and O
reforms O
there O
, O
the O
outcome O
was O
that O
wealth O
had O
fled O
into O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
" O
elite O
" O
and O
the O
foreigners O
. O

The O
ordinary O
people O
were O
left O
only O
with O
" O
reform O
" O
, O
while O
the O
" O
elite O
" O
who O
constituted O
less O
than O
10 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
China O
held O
more O
than O
90 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
the O
wealth O
. O

No O
matter O
how O
the O
" O
elite O
" O
sugarcoated O
it O
, O
the O
fact O
was O
still O
a O
fact O
. O

First O
- O
hand O
experience O
is O
more O
authoritative O
than O
any O
smooth O
talk O
. O

As O
long O
as O
an O
ordinary O
Chinese B-NORP
's O
IQ O
is O
not O
the O
same O
as O
that O
of O
the O
house O
dogs O
of O
the O
jet O
set O
, O
they O
can O
not O
possibly O
remained O
indifferent O
when O
faced O
with O
such O
reality O
. O

If O
the O
" O
elite O
" O
want O
the O
ordinary O
people O
to O
have O
no O
opinion O
or O
bitterness O
over O
this O
, O
depriving O
the O
ordinary O
people O
of O
their O
" O
right O
of O
speech O
" O
would O
be O
useless O
, O
using O
" O
entitlement O
theory O
" O
to O
deprive O
the O
ordinary O
people O
of O
their O
right O
to O
thought O
would O
be O
useless O
, O
and O
" O
revealing O
the O
dagger O
at O
the O
end O
" O
by O
using O
politics O
, O
violence O
and O
suppression O
would O
be O
even O
more O
useless O
. O

Reckoning O
all O
the O
options O
, O
it O
seems O
that O
the O
only O
thing O
to O
do O
is O
to O
eliminate O
the O
ordinary O
people O
's O
ability O
to O
perceive O
, O
causing O
the O
ordinary O
people O
to O
have O
absolutely O
no O
consciousness O
of O
any O
of O
the O
suffering O
. O

This O
might O
have O
solved O
the O
problem O
-- O
of O
course O
, O
this O
is O
the O
elite O
's O
" O
most O
ideal O
" O
solution O
. O

As O
long O
as O
this O
day O
dream O
is O
n't O
realized O
, O
ordinary O
people O
will O
inevitably O
have O
their O
own O
assessment O
of O
all O
the O
facts O
, O
and O
it O
is O
unlikely O
that O
the O
" O
reforms O
" O
of O
the O
" O
elite O
" O
wo O
n't O
have O
a O
stink O
about O
them O
in O
the O
minds O
of O
ordinary O
people O
. O

It O
was O
n't O
that O
anybody O
had O
used O
language O
to O
give O
reform O
a O
" O
stink O
" O
, O
but O
that O
the O
" O
elite O
" O
had O
used O
action O
themselves O
to O
make O
themselves O
" O
stink O
" O
and O
make O
their O

stink O

I O
had O
a O
very O
lonely O
childhood O
because O
I O
was O
the O
only O
child O
in O
the O
family O
, O
and O
most O
of O
my O
playmates O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
had O
moved O
to O
the O
cities O
. O

Life O
, O
like O
that O
small O
river O
in O
front O
of O
my O
home O
, O
flowed O
quietly O
without O
the O
slightest O
ripple O
. O

I O
often O
stayed O
on O
the O
riverbank O
by O
myself O
, O
watching O
the O
boats O
pass O
by O
. O

They O
were O
all O
very O
small O
fishing O
boats O
, O
and O
under O
each O
canopy O
was O
a O
household O
. O

I O
did O
not O
know O
where O
they O
came O
from O
or O
where O
they O
were O
going O
. O

It O
seemed O
that O
I O
never O
saw O
the O
same O
boat O
pass O
by O
twice O
. O

My O
mother O
sometimes O
asked O
: O
" O
Huazi B-PERSON
, O
why O
do O
you O
go O
to O
the O
riverbank O
? O
" O

I O
said O
: O
" O
To O
watch O
the O
boats O
. O
" O

I O
could O
not O
see O
either O
end O
of O
the O
river O
. O

I O
started O
to O
think O
that O
this O
world O
must O
be O
very O
large O
, O
but O
that O
it O
does O
not O
belong O
to O
me O
. O

I O
just O
stood O
on O
the O
riverbank O
watching O
. O

The O
year O
when O
I O
was O
eight B-CARDINAL
, O
we O
also O
moved O
to O
live O
on O
a O
street O
in O
the O
center O
of O
a O
small O
town O
. O

Uncle O
Baocheng B-PERSON
still O
lived O
a O
lone O
life O
by O
the O
river O
by O
himself O
. O

I O
would O
still O
go O
visit O
him O
. O

On O
New B-DATE
Year I-DATE
's I-DATE
Day I-DATE
and O
other O
holidays O
, O
my O
parents O
would O
invite O
him O
over O
for O
meals O
. O

In O
a O
flash O
, O
I O
was O
twelve B-CARDINAL
and O
attending O
a O
local O
middle O
school O
that O
had O
a O
bad O
reputation O
. O

Actually O
I O
graduated O
from O
elementary O
school O
with O
very O
good O
grades O
, O
but O
because O
my O
parents O
were O
not O
well O
connected O
, O
I O
was O
rejected O
by O
the O
best O
one O
, O
No. B-ORDINAL
1 I-ORDINAL
Middle O
School O
. O

I O
was O
somewhat O
despondent O
. O

After O
they O
received O
the O
notice O
, O
my O
parents O
were O
very O
down O
. O

I O
went O
out O
by O
myself O
and O
kept O
walking O
until O
dark O
. O

I O
found O
I O
had O
come O
to O
the O
riverbank O
, O
and O
thought O
I O
might O
go O
and O
drop O
a O
visit O
to O
Uncle O
Baocheng B-PERSON
. O

I O
have O
n't O
written O
about O
soccer O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

If O
I O
still O
do O
n't O
write O
anything O
, O
I O
will O
feel O
even O
sorry O
for O
myself O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
you O
can O
ever O
get O
all O
the O
people O
in O
a O
team O
together O
. O

First O
Cambiasso B-PERSON
was O
injured O
. O

Now O
he O
's O
back O
, O
yet O
Cruz B-PERSON
has O
gone O
for O
treatment O
. O

And O
do O
n't O
even O
start O
on O
Boba B-PERSON
; O
he O
's O
always O
injured O
. O

It O
would O
even O
be O
strange O
if O
he O
was O
not O
injured O
. O

But O
it O
's O
OK O
, O
as O
there O
's O
a O
back O
- O
up O
for O
every O
person O
's O
position O
, O
and O
the O
back O
- O
ups O
are O
all O
pretty O
strong O
. O

Now O
if O
Inter B-ORG
Milan I-ORG
formed O
a O
second O
team O
of O
a O
lineup O
, O
it O
would O
be O
also O
very O
strong O
indeed O
. O

Tonight O
they O
're O
playing O
Lisbon B-PERSON
, O
and O
I O
expect O
I O
will O
get O
up O
and O
watch O
the O
game O
. O

Since O
I O
went O
to O
school O
I O
have O
n't O
watched O
much O
soccer O
, O
and O
now O
my O
soccer O
cravings O
have O
kicked O
in O
again O
. O

I O
've O
seen O
a O
lot O
of O
matches O
this O
season O
, O
but O
I O
only O
watched O
up O
to O
the O
match O
where O
they O
lost O
to O
Bayern O
. O

I O
believe O
they O
wo O
n't O
run O
into O
that O
kind O
of O
thing O
again O
tonight O
. O

The O
reason O
they O
lost O
to O
Lisbon B-GPE
in O
the O
first O
leg O
was O
actually O
still O
that O
Inter B-ORG

They O
did O
n't O
give O
much O
thought O
to O
the O

But O
tonight O
it O

different O

they O

lost O
before O
, O
they O
are O

allowed O
to O
lose O

in O
this O
match O
, O

More O

, O
if O
they O
can O
just O
win O
this O
match O
then O
they O
can O
go O
through O
early O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
Mancini B-PERSON
will O
have O
failed O

understand O
the O
importance O
of O
this O
match O
. O

In O
the O

they O
take O
this O
match O
very O
seriously O
. O

They O
think O
it O

as O
important O

a O

that O
this O

it O
has O

influenced O

According O
to O

, O
in O
Henan B-GPE
Province I-GPE
where O

is O
located O
, O
the O
first O
sale O
of O
temporary O

only O
began O
last O

It O
attracted O
multiple O

from O

companies O
. O

France B-GPE
and O
Rwanda B-GPE
have O
fallen O
out O
with O
each O
other O
. O

They O
have O
expelled O
each O
others O
' O
diplomats O
and O
closed O
their O
embassies O
. O

Lastly O
, O
the O
government O
of O
Rwanda B-GPE
announced O
that O
it O
was O
cutting O
off O
diplomatic O
relations O
with O
France B-GPE
entirely O
. O

The O
cause O
is O
said O
to O
be O
that O
a O
French B-NORP
judge O
issued O
an O
international O
warrant O
for O
the O
arrest O
of O
nine B-QUANTITY
important O
members O
of O
the O
Rwandan B-NORP
government O
on O
the O
charge O
that O
they O
participated O
in O
the O
assassination O
of O
Rwanda B-GPE
's O
former O
president O
twelve B-QUANTITY
years O
before O
. O

The O
Rwandan B-NORP
government O
has O
resolutely O
denied O
the O
charge O
, O
while O
the O
international O
community O
has O
likewise O
not O
come O
to O
any O
conclusion O
regarding O
the O
affair O
. O

It O
is O
simply O
that O
the O
families O
of O
the O
French B-NORP
flight O
crew O
have O
brought O
the O
case O
to O
the O
court O
in O
France B-GPE
when O
the O
former O
president O
was O
killed O
and O
thus O
, O
that O
judge O
and O
the O
government O
want O
to O
hold O
their O
own O
law O
over O
the O
heads O
of O
others O
. O

If O
you O
put O
aside O
whether O
the O
evidence O
is O
conclusive O
and O
look O
only O
at O
the O
obstacles O
from O
international O
law O
that O
the O
case O
will O
inevitably O
face O
, O
you O
will O
know O
that O
this O
French B-GPE
faux O
- O
pas O
against O
Rwanda B-GPE
on O
this O
occasion O
is O
extremely O
unwise O
. O

The O
international O
media O
has O
found O
a O
few O
surprises O
during O
President O
Hu B-PERSON
's O
visits O
to O
the O
four B-QUANTITY
nations O
of O
Vietnam B-GPE
, O
Laos B-GPE
, O
India B-GPE
and O
Pakistan B-GPE
: O

Receiving O
" O
extraordinary O
- O
level O
reception O
" O
in O
Vietnam B-GPE
, O
according O
to O
most O
Vietnam B-GPE
media O
, O
were O
, O
Hu B-PERSON
in O
the O
first O
and O
Bush B-PERSON
in O
the O
second O
; O
a O
break O
with O
diplomatic O
convention O
when O
both O
the O
general O
secretary O
and O
the O
chairman O
accompanied O
Hu B-PERSON
during O
the O
troop O
review O
; O
the O
meeting O
of O
Bush B-PERSON
, O
Abe B-PERSON
, O
Roh B-PERSON
Moo I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
hyun I-PERSON
and O
others O
with O
Hu B-PERSON
was O
safely O
held O
in O
the O
hotel O
where O
Hu B-PERSON
was O
staying O
, O
thereby O
making O
it O
resemble O
an O
audience O
with O
an O
emperor O
. O

And O
this O
even O
resulted O
in O
the O
international O
media O
closely O
chasing O
Hu B-PERSON
in O
his O
footsteps O
as O
he O
made O
this O
trip O
on O
his O
subsequent O
trips O
to O
Laos B-GPE
, O
India B-GPE
, O
and O
Pakistan B-GPE
. O

Since O
China B-GPE
had O
already O
taken O
itself O
to O
this O
step O
, O
it O
would O
n't O
seem O
possible O
to O
not O
be O
in O
the O
international O
media O
headlines O
if O
it O
ever O
wishes O
not O
to O
. O

For O
example O
, O
when O
China B-GPE
and O
India B-GPE
shook O
hands O
, O
it O
implied O
that O
25 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
the O
people O
on O
Earth B-LOC
had O
reconciled O
. O

What O
was O
there O
in O
the O
international O
news O
that O
was O
more O
attention O
- O
grabbing O
than O
that O
. O

Following O
the O
government O
's O
announcement O
of O
new B-LAW
immigration I-LAW
regulations I-LAW
, O
all O
travelers O
arriving O
in O
New B-GPE
Zealand I-GPE
will O
receive O
the O
same O
treatment O
as O
they O
would O
receive O
when O
going O
to O
the O
US B-GPE
. O

When O
they O
enter O
the O
country O
, O
they O
will O
be O
asked O
to O
provide O
biometric O
information O
. O

At O
a O
press O
conference O
this O
afternoon O
, O
new B-LAW
immigration I-LAW
law I-LAW
confirmed O
by O
Immigration O
Minister O
David B-PERSON
Cunliffe I-PERSON
will O
give O
immigration O
officials O
the O
power O
to O
collect O
, O
store O
and O
use O
biometric O
information O
of O
non-New B-NORP
Zealand I-NORP
citizens O
. O

These O
so O
- O
called O
non-New B-NORP
Zealand I-NORP
citizens O
include O
people O
with O
a O
tourist O
, O
temporary O
or O
residency O
visa O
. O

These B-LAW
new I-LAW
regulations I-LAW
are O
very O
similar O
to O
procedures O
for O
entering O
the O
US B-GPE
. O

The B-LAW
new I-LAW
immigration I-LAW
law I-LAW
also O
permits O
the O
immigration O
service O
to O
provide O
" O
limited O
" O
biometric O
information O
on O
New B-GPE
Zealand I-GPE
citizens O
to O
neighboring O
countries O
. O

However O
, O
the B-LAW
law I-LAW
does O
not O
explain O
the O
reason O
. O

Cunliffe B-PERSON
said O
, O
it O
has O
presently O
not O
been O
decided O
when O
or O
how O
the O
biometric O
information O
will O
be O
collected O
from O
people O
's O
bodies O
. O

The O
government O
has O
introduced O
legislation O
that O
will O
permit O
further O
collection O
of O
DNA O
samples O
from O
people O
's O
bodies O
. O

The B-LAW
new I-LAW
regulation I-LAW
on O
biometric O
information O
is O
only O
one O
article O
among O
the O
sixty B-QUANTITY
- I-QUANTITY
one I-QUANTITY
articles O
that O
make O
up O
the B-LAW
new I-LAW
regulations I-LAW
. O

Cunliffe B-PERSON
said O
the B-LAW
new I-LAW
regulations I-LAW
will O
effectively O
simplify O
border O
- O
entry O
procedures O
and O
protect O
citizens O
' O
right O
and O
international O
human O
rights O
. O

Prior O
to O
Darwin B-PERSON
, O
there O
were O
two B-CARDINAL
schools O
of O
ecological O
thought O
: O
harmony O
theory O
and O
conflict O
theory O
. O

Darwin B-PERSON
was O
the O
consolidator O
. O

If O
we O
take O
a O
comprehensive O
look O
at O
Darwin B-PERSON
's O
thought O
today O
, O
he O
has O
not O
been O
seen O
, O
as O
we O
initially O
thought O
, O
to O
merely O
inherit O
the O
conflict O
thought O
of O
which O
Malthus B-PERSON
is O
the O
representative O
. O

Darwin B-PERSON
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
also O
inherits O
the O
thought O
of O
harmony O
. O

In O
his O
early O
years O
, O
Darwin B-PERSON
was O
an O
admirer O
of O
Linne B-PERSON
. O

After O
reading O
Linne B-PERSON
's O
works O
, O
Darwin B-PERSON
formulated O
the O
following O
type O
of O
view O
regarding O
the O
natural O
world O
: O
that O
nature O
is O
a O
complex O
network O
and O
is O
replete O
with O
harmony O
and O
interdependence O
. O

For O
example O
, O
can O
a O
species O
of O
plant O
depend O
on O
itself O
to O
survive O
? O

It O
is O
impossible O
. O

When O
it O
blooms O
, O
it O
needs O
help O
from O
bees O
to O
disseminate O
pollen O
for O
it O
. O

When O
it O
bears O
fruit O
, O
it O
needs O
birds O
to O
transfer O
its O
fruit O
elsewhere O
. O

Only O
in O
this O
way O
can O
this O
species O
of O
plant O
propagate O
and O
spread O
its O
own O
future O
generations O
to O
all O
the O
corners O
of O
the O
Earth B-LOC
. O

So O
he O
proposed O
that O
the O
nature O
was O
a O
complex O
network O
and O
that O
its O
members O
were O
interdependent O
. O

This O
was O
the O
first O
stage O
in O
his O
research O
and O
his O
entire O
theory O
. O

met O
with O
Chinese B-NORP

Xia B-PERSON
Deren I-PERSON
briefed O
Ambassador O
Wang B-PERSON
Yi I-PERSON
on O
the O
main O
content O
of O
this O
" O
Week B-EVENT
of I-EVENT
Dalian I-EVENT
" O
event O
and O
on O
the O
friendly O
exchange O
activities O
they O
had O
carried O
out O
with O
some O
Japanese B-NORP
cities O
during O
the O
several O
days O
since O
they O
arrived O
in O
Japan B-GPE

At O
first O
, O
I O
signed O
up O
for O
a O
blog O
on O
DONEWS B-ORG
, O
thinking O
that O
it O
was O
a O
site O
for O
IT O
professionals O
where O
I O
could O
perhaps O
find O
friends O
more O
easily O
. O

Later O
, O
I O
signed O
up O
for O
another O
one O
on O
MSN B-ORG
, O
feeling O
that O
writing O
on O
MSN B-ORG
might O
make O
it O
easier O
for O
me O
to O
communicate O
directly O
with O
my O
MSN B-ORG
pals O
. O

But O
gradually O
, O
I O
discovered O
that O
both O
sites O
were O
not O
very O
good O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
DONEWS B-ORG
did O
not O
have O
the O
function O
of O
tallying O
traffic O
statistics O
-LRB- O
I O
have O
the O
habit O
of O
looking O
at O
the O
statistics O
of O
everything O
-RRB- O
; O
and O
even O
though O
MSN B-ORG
had O
that O
function O
, O
others O
needed O
to O
sign O
on O
to O
MSN B-ORG
before O
they O
could O
reply O
, O
this O
meant O
that O
after O
reading O
the O
entries O
, O
many O
could O
not O
reply O
even O
if O
they O
wanted O
to O
, O
hence O
largely O
reducing O
the O
interactive O
element O
. O

The O
enthusiasm O
with O
writing O
the O
blog O
at O
the O
beginning O
was O
short O
- O
lived O
; O
after O
writing O
a O
few O
original O
articles O
for O
promotion O
, O
I O
did O
not O
continue O
anymore O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
think O
about O
posting O
articles O
from O
other O
sites O
as O
I O
felt O
that O
there O
was O
no O
need O
to O
post O
any O
articles O
if O
I O
could O
not O
come O
up O
with O
anything O
original O
; O
this O
meant O
that O
sometimes O
for O
over O
two O
months O
I O
did O
n't O
even O
update O
a O
new O
entry O
. O

Later O
, O
there O
were O
also O
some O
minor O
problems O
with O
both O
MSN B-ORG
and O
DONEWS B-ORG
, O
so O
I O
became O
more O
unwilling O
to O
post O
new O
articles O
. O

So O
, O
these O
two O
blogs O
have O
not O
really O
been O
very O
popular O
, O
either O

The O
more O
than O
6,000 B-QUANTITY
workers O
that O
this O
group O
used O
to O
have O
were O
all O
bought O
out O
. O

Only O
some O
700 B-QUANTITY
people O
work O
at O
the O
reorganized O
Cinda B-ORG
Changlin I-ORG
Group I-ORG
. O

The O
rest O
of O
them O
have O
all O
scattered O
in O
limbo O
as O
they O
search O
for O
a O
way O
to O
make O
a O
living O
. O

Since O
January B-DATE
2005 I-DATE
, O
they O
themselves O
have O
had O
to O
renew O
insurances O
by O
themselves O
. O

For O
the O
costs O
of O
retirement O
and O
health O
insurances O
at O
current O
levels O
, O
each O
person O
has O
to O
pay O
about O
3,000 B-MONEY
yuan I-MONEY
per O
year O
. O

Where O
can O
they O
go O
to O
get O
the O
money O
? O

This O
month O
Jiangxi B-GPE
Province I-GPE
increased O
pension O
payments O
to O
the O
retirees O
, O
but O
all O
the O
indispensable O
living O
costs O
that O
a O
person O
needs O
to O
pay O
for O
have O
started O
to O
rise O
accordingly O
in O
the O
markets O
. O

The O
government O
's O
" O
average O
wage O
" O
level O
is O
going O
to O
rise O
again O
, O
so O
next O
year O
the O
costs O
of O
retirement O
and O
health O
insurances O
that O
laid O
- O
off O
workers O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
will O
rise O
again O
. O

Even O
for O
those O
laid O
- O
off O
workers O
who O
can O
find O
work O
, O
are O
private O
companies O
going O
to O
give O
them O
higher O
wages O
? O

And O
how O
are O
those O
who O
can O
not O
find O
jobs O
going O
to O
make O
a O
living O
? O

Has O
the O
government O
thought O
about O
this O
? O

If O
there O
are O
problems O
in O
the O
future O
, O
who O
will O
then O
be O
the O
one O
breaking O
the O
" O
law O
" O
? O

After O
entering O
into O
the O
WTO B-ORG
, O
we O
frequently O
see O
that O
the O
viewpoint O
of O
reporters O
when O
criticizing O
domestic O
banks O
is O
: O
When O
the O
foreign O
- O
funded O
banks O
arrive O
later O
on O
, O
if O
your O
service O
attitude O
does O
n't O
improve O
a O
bit O
, O
I O
will O
take O
my O
money O
and O
deposit O
it O
in O
a O
foreign O
- O
funded O
bank O
. O

Then O
we O
'll O
see O
what O
these O
state O
- O
owned O
banks O
do O
! O

Furthermore O
, O
we O
frequently O
see O
theoretical O
articles O
saying O
that O
the O
arrival O
of O
foreign O
- O
funded O
banks O
will O
lead O
to O
domestic O
banks O
suffering O
a O
massive O
loss O
of O
trained O
personnel O
because O
of O
the O
wage O
and O
benefit O
issue O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
there O
are O
many O
areas O
in O
which O
I O
am O
also O
dissatisfied O
naturally O
with O
the O
service O
of O
domestic O
banks O
. O

Regarding O
salaries O
at O
the O
domestic O
banks O
, O
I O
also O
know O
a O
thing O
or O
two O
. O

But O
using O
foreign O
- O
funded O
banks O
to O
scare O
people O
has O
absolutely O
no O
meaning O
with O
regard O
to O
solving O
the O
problem O
. O

The O
first O
thing O
that O
has O
to O
be O
clarified O
is O
that O
foreign O
- O
funded O
banks O
do O
not O
act O
selflessly O
and O
go O
out O
of O
their O
way O
to O
help O
others O
. O

They O
have O
a O
threshold O
. O

Judging O
from O
the O
present O
, O
they O
only O
serve O
the O
wealthy O
portion O
of O
the O
population O
, O
so O
the O
majority O
of O
those O
who O
are O
enthusiastically O
waiting O
in O
anticipation O
will O
probably O
be O
disappointed O
. O

So O
you O
feel O
that O
the O
line O
to O
deposit O
money O
in O
a O
domestic O
bank O
is O
long O
and O
you O
want O
to O
transfer O
to O
a O
foreign O
- O
funded O
bank O
? O

Without O
several O
hundred B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
or O
a O
million B-CARDINAL
, O
even O
if O
you O
want O
to O
become O
somebody O
else O
's O
client O
, O
they O
wo O
n't O
want O
you O
. O

As O
for O
the O
outflow O
of O
trained O
personnel O
, O
most O
employees O
of O
domestic O
banks O
have O
been O
stirred O
into O
an O
frenzy O
by O
the O
media O
and O
can O
hardly O
sit O
still O
as O
they O
wait O
for O
the O
day O
they O
will O
be O
enlisted O
. O

However O
, O
it O
's O
being O
said O
that O
these O
people O
want O
to O
train O
their O
own O
employees O
and O
the O
first O
to O
be O
hired O
will O
be O
fresh O
university O
graduates O
. O

The O
people O
who O
have O
worked O
in O
domestic O
banks O
so O
long O
will O
not O
be O
in O
the O
ranks O
of O
those O
welcomed O
unless O
they O
are O
extremely O
specific O
high O
- O
level O
personnel O
with O
customer O
resources O
. O

In O

[] O
Just O
after O
we O
left O
Chengdu O
, O
it O
again O
began O
the O
pattering O
of O
small O
raindrops O
. O

Very O
soon O
, O
we O
had O
arrived O
at O
Dujiang O
Weir O
. O

[] O
I O
knew O
this O
area O
very O
well O
because O
I O
'd O
been O
here O
many O
times O
before O
. O

Originally O
I O
had O
planned O
to O
drive O
to O
the O
opening O
of O
the O
weir O
and O
take O
a O
couple O
of O
photos O
to O
record O
the O
scenic O
spot O
of O
this O
entire O
journey O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
fog O
was O
even O
thicker O
by O
this O
time O
and O
there O
was O
simply O
no O
way O
to O
see O
the O
scenery O
, O
so O
there O
was O
nothing O
to O
do O
but O
to O
give O
up O
. O

[] O
The O
car O
followed O
the O
west O
route O
of O
the O
Sichuan O
's O
famous O
Jiu O
Huan O
Road O
going O
up O
against O
the O
Minjiang O

[] O
Jiu O
Huan O
Road O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
tourist O
main O
route O
in O
Sichuan O
. O

It O
links O
most O
of O
the O
Sichuan O

scenic O

spots O
, O
including O
Dujiang O

Siguniang O

[] O
At O
the O

the O
Jiu O

also O
links O
the O

The O

us O
at O

My O
wife O
job O
- O
hopped O
from O
a O
Chinese B-NORP
- O
funded O
bank O
to O
a O
foreign O
- O
funded O
bank O
, O

Either O
in O
terms O
of O
her O
experience O
or O
her O
ability O
, O
my O
wife O
is O
not O
my O
match O
, O
and O
most O
of O
the O
time O
I O
am O
her O
professional O
teacher O
. O

Her O
only O
advantage O
is O
her O
foreign O
language O
. O

After O
all O
, O
she O
is O
an O
English B-NORP
major O
graduate O
. O

Now O
that O
she O
joined O
a O
foreign O
- O
funded O
bank O
, O
her O
position O
and O
salary O
are O
both O
higher O
than O
mine O
, O

Many O
times O
I O
would O
tease O
her O
, O
saying O
that O
they O
had O
chosen O
her O
, O
a O
seemingly O
qualified O
candidate O
, O
from O
a O
bunch O
of O
inferiors O
... O

My O
wife O
would O
answer O
: O
too O
bad O
my O
English B-NORP
is O
better O
than O
yours O
!? O

I O
could O
n't O
argue O
with O
that O
, O
as O
English B-NORP
is O
my O
weakness O
. O

I O
have O
gone O
for O
numerous O
recruitment O
interviews O
for O
the O
foreign O
- O
funded O
banks O
in O
the O
past O
few O
years O
, O
and O
also O
have O
had O
some O
contacts O
with O
foreign O
- O
funded O
banks O
. O

My O
wife O
's O
situation O
might O
have O
been O
a O
puzzle O
for O
many O
foreign O
- O
funded O
banks O
' O
recruitment O
. O

It O
is O
inevitable O
for O
foreign O
- O
funded O
banks O
to O
deploy O
a O
strategy O
of O
utilizing O
local O
talent O
. O

Although O
there O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
recruiting O
information O
from O
foreign O
- O
funded O
banks O
on O
the O
Internet O
every O
day O
, O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
the O
satisfactory O
candidates O
that O
they O
can O
find O
are O
very O
few O
. O

It O
has O
been O
almost O
ten O
years O
from O
the O
first O
time O
I O
got O
to O
know O
about O
Inter B-ORG
Milan I-ORG
from O
the O
newspaper O
, O
and O
then O
later O
I O
grew O
to O
like O
Inter B-ORG
Milan I-ORG
and O
to O
the O
time O
when O
I O
fell O
deeply O
in O
love O
with O
Inter B-ORG
Milan I-ORG
. O

Actually O
, O
Inter B-ORG
Milan I-ORG
has O
n't O
achieved O
overly O
spectacular O
results O
in O
the O
last O
ten B-QUANTITY
years O
. O

Except O
a O
few O
prizes O
of O
little O
interest O
like O
a B-EVENT
UEFA I-EVENT
Cup I-EVENT
, O
a O
few O
divisional O
cups O
and O
a O
few O
Super B-EVENT
Cups I-EVENT
, O
it O
has O
never O
once B-ORDINAL
gotten O
a O
hand O
on O
a B-EVENT
Champions I-EVENT
Cup I-EVENT
or O
a B-EVENT
UEFA I-EVENT
Champions I-EVENT
League I-EVENT
Cup I-EVENT
. O

These O
achievements O
simply O
are O
n't O
worth O
mentioning O
when O
compared O
with O
those O
of O
powerhouses O
such O
as O
Manchester B-ORG
United I-ORG
and O
Real B-ORG
Madrid I-ORG
. O

Even O
within O
Italy O
, O
their O
records O
are O
quite O
far O
behind O
Juventus B-ORG
and O
AC B-ORG
. O

Then O
why O
do O
I O
still O
like O
Inter B-ORG
Milan I-ORG
? O

Why O
is O
there O
only O
the O
blue O
and O
blacks O
in O
my O
heart O
? O

When O
I O
first B-ORDINAL
came O
into O
contact O
with O
football O
, O
I O
appreciated O
it O
with O
a O
mindset O
of O
commiseration O
with O
the O
underdog O
. O

Inter B-ORG
Milan I-ORG
's O
just O
a O
step O
away O
from O
the O
championship O
for O
years O
and O
its O
long O
humiliation O
by O
Juventus B-ORG
and O
AC B-ORG
stirred O
a O
sense O
of O
sympathy O
in O
me O
; O

Secondly B-ORDINAL
, O
I O
found O
Inter B-ORG
Milan I-ORG
's I-ORG
blue O
and O
black O
jerseys O
look O
very O
comfortable O
to O
me O
visually O
. O

Gradually O
, O
I O
was O
moved O
by O
the O
persistence O
of O
Inter B-ORG
Milan I-ORG
's I-ORG
chairman O
Mr. B-PERSON
Moratti I-PERSON
. O

Although O
the O
payoff O
has O
been O
small O
after O
decades B-DATE
of O
persistent O
investment O
, O
that O
does O
n't O
change O
his O
absolute O
sincerity O
toward O
Inter B-ORG
Milan I-ORG
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
I O
started O
to O
pay O
more O
attention O
to O
this O
soccer O
team O

Today O

[] O
Another O

Two B-QUANTITY

in O
Baghdad B-GPE
, O
with O
their O
limbs O
flown O
everywhere O
and O
flesh O
all O
over O
the O
bloody O
ground O
. O

This O
results O
in O
the O
biggest O
death O
toll O
since O
the O
deposing O
of O
Saddam B-PERSON
. O

The O
Sunni B-NORP
and O
Shiite B-NORP
factions O
have O
quickly O
competed O
to O
blame O
each O
other O
, O
making O
this O
shocking O
massacre O
, O
which O
no O
one O
will O
admit O
, O
seem O
even O
more O
horrific O
. O

Bush B-PERSON
, O
who O
ca O
n't O
even O
protect O
himself O
, O
has O
long O
given O
up O
his O
cowboy O
act O
. O

Before O
Thanksgiving B-DATE
he O
released O
turkeys O
according O
to O
tradition O
, O
yet O
untraditionally O
, O
he O
admitted O
that O
" O
the O
Iraq B-GPE
war O
is O
now O
like O
the O
Vietnam B-GPE
war O
. O
" O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
the O
Iraqi B-GPE
authorities O
, O
who O
are O
struggling O
hard O
to O
survive O
, O
are O
going O
to O
think O
. O

Perhaps O
the O
summit O
that O
Iran B-GPE
, O
Iraq B-GPE
and O
Syria B-GPE
are O
planning O
is O
their O
move O
to O
seek O
for O
self O
- O
salvation O
. O

But O
one O
of O
the O
participants O
of O
the O
summit O
is O
unexpectedly O
none O
other O
than O
the O
mortal O
enemy O
of O
the O
US B-GPE
. O

As O
Iraq B-GPE
does O
n't O
evade O
it O
, O
and O
the O
US B-GPE
can O
not O
block O
it O
, O
this O
is O
enough O
to O
show O
that O
those O
215 B-QUANTITY
wronged O
spirits O
have O
actually O
found O
peace O
. O

There O
came O
the O
news O
of O
an O
explosion O
at O
Moscow B-FAC
University I-FAC
. O

No O
one O
was O
hurt O
, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
serious O
psychological O
blow O
. O

Moscow B-FAC
University I-FAC
is O
a O
symbol O
of O
Russia B-GPE
. O

Its O
position O
is O
even O
higher O
than O
that O
of O
Harvard B-FAC
in O
the O
US B-GPE
. O

If O
people O
's O
evil O
conduct O
even O
befalls O
such O
hallowed O
ground O
, O
then O
the O
hurt O
it O
causes O
to O
the O
people O
's O
heart O
and O
even O
the O
president O
can O
be O
easily O
imagined O
. O

Putin B-PERSON
was O
already O
feeling O
down O
and O
upset O
. O

The O
West B-LOC
insists O
that O
that O
defected O
spy O
who O
died O
in O
exile O
in O
London B-GPE
was O
eliminated O
on O
Putin B-PERSON

orders O
. O

They O
've O
gone O
on O
to O
call O
Putin B-PERSON
" O
a O
cold O
war O
schemer O
. O
" O

The O
handsome O
and O
cool O
- O
styled O
Putin B-PERSON
has O
become O
furious O
, O
with O
the O
Russian B-NORP
government O
issuing O
a O
very O
strongly O
worded O
denial O
as O
well O
. O

But O
the O
all O
too O
credible O
" O
last O
words O
of O
the O
spy O
, O
" O
together O
with O
Putin B-PERSON
's O
own O
background O
in O
espionage O
, O
have O
still O
managed O
to O
put O
a O
scowl O
on O
the O
face O
of O
this O
modern O
popular O
leader O
at O
the O
Russia B-GPE
- O
EU B-GPE
summit O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
pointing O
out O
the O
commonly O
seen O
advantages O
of O
the O
Caucasians B-NORP
: O
steel O
, O
technologies O
, O
weapons O
, O
central O
and O
unified O
government O
, O
Desmond B-PERSON
especially O
stressed O
one O
little O
- O
known O
factor O
-- O
bacteria O
. O

He O
said O
that O
when O
the O
Caucasians B-NORP
conquered O
the O
new O
continent O
, O
the O
bacteria O
on O
their O
bodies O
killed O
far O
more O
Indians B-NORP
than O
their O
weapons O
. O

In O
1519 B-DATE
, O
six B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
Spaniards B-NORP
landed O
on O
Mexico B-NORP
to O
conquer O
the O
Aztec B-NORP
Empire O
with O
a O
population O
of O
a B-CARDINAL
few I-CARDINAL
millions I-CARDINAL
. O

They O
lost O
two B-PERCENT
thirds I-PERCENT
of O
their O
soldiers O
in O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
clash O
. O

What O
gave O
them O
the O
decisive O
advantage O
was O
smallpox O
. O

In O
1520 B-DATE
the O
Spaniard B-NORP
infected O
the O
opponent O
with O
smallpox O
, O
killing O
half B-PERCENT
of O
the O
people O
in O
the O
Aztec B-NORP
Empire O
including O
its O
emperor O
. O

In O
1618 B-DATE
Mexico B-GPE
's O
twenty B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
people O
were O
reduced O
to O
1.6 B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
due O
to O
the O
epidemic O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
Indians B-NORP
lacked O
a O
kind O
of O
bacteria O
to O
effectively O
attack O
the O
opponent O
party O
. O

Desmond B-PERSON
did O
not O
attribute O
bacteria O
to O
the O
human O
species O
, O
but O
believed O
that O
they O
, O
together O
with O
steel O
, O
guns O
and O
cannons O
, O
directly O
or O
indirectly O
originated O
from O
farming O
. O

More O
than O
half B-PERCENT
of O
the O
UEFA B-ORG
Champions I-ORG
League I-ORG
games O
have O
already O
taken O
place O
, O
and O
basically O
many O
strong O
teams O
are O
guaranteed O
access O
to O
the B-EVENT
elimination I-EVENT
series I-EVENT
. O

Although O
the O
focus O
of O
this O
round O
is O
on O
the O
match O
between O
Basa B-ORG
and O
Chelsea B-ORG
, O
there O
is O
little O
doubt O
that O
they O
would O
jointly O
enter O
the B-EVENT
quarter I-EVENT
- I-EVENT
finals I-EVENT
. O

But O
the O
situation O
is O
very O
complicated O
in O
Group B-ORG
B I-ORG
; O
if O
Bayern B-ORG
does O
its O
best O
and O
judging O
by O
their O
abilities O
, O
they O
should O
entirely O
demolish O
the B-ORG
Sporting I-ORG
Lisbon I-ORG
. O

Internazionale B-ORG
Milan I-ORG
has O
lost O
the O
previous O
two B-QUANTITY
matches O
to O
the O
opponents O
, O
but O
now O
they O
have O
finally O
began O
to O
explode O
; O
it O
remains O
to O
be O
seen O
if O
such O
an O
explosion O
would O
be O
too O
late O
. O

On O
the O
4th B-ORDINAL
day O
of O
the O
matches O
, O
Internazionale B-ORG
Milan I-ORG
would O
be O
in O
freezing O
- O
cold O
Moscow B-GPE
; O
Spartak B-ORG
is O
the O
only O
team O
that O
uses O
artificial O
turf O
, O
and O
it O
will O
be O
a O
great O
test O
for O
the B-ORG
Internazionale I-ORG
Milan I-ORG
. O

Inter B-ORG
Milan I-ORG
is O
without O
its O
four B-QUANTITY
key O
players O
, O
Cambiasso B-PERSON
, O
Recoba B-PERSON
, O
Adriano B-PERSON
, O
and O
Vieira B-PERSON
. O

With O
the O
absence O
of O
these O
four B-QUANTITY
players O
, O
it O
is O
estimated O
that O
Internazionale B-ORG
Milan I-ORG
might O
be O
significantly O
affected O
. O

If O
they O
can O
not O
score O
three B-QUANTITY
points O
in O
this O
match O
, O
their O
mission O
of O
acquiring O
the O
championship O
basically O
comes O
to O
an O
end O
. O

There O
are O
some O
other O
games O
where O
the O
outcomes O
are O
fairly O
certain O
from O
my O
point O
of O
view O
. O

Both O
the B-ORG
English I-ORG
Super I-ORG
and O
Italy B-NORP
's O
Serie B-ORG
A I-ORG
have O
their O
advantages O
to O
some O
extent O
; O
but O
Italy B-NORP
's O
Serie B-ORG
A I-ORG
play O
two B-QUANTITY
games O
within O
a O
week O
, O
and O
this O
would O
put O
their O
physical O
abilities O
to O
the O
test O
. O

Especially O
for O
the B-ORG
Internazionale I-ORG
Milan I-ORG
, O
who O
exerted O
tremendous O
effort O
in O
trying O
to O
win O
the O
big O
game O
against O
AC B-ORG
Milan I-ORG
in O
the O
Derby O
war O
; O
now O
they O
must O
be O
mentally O
and O
physically O
exhausted O
after O
they O
arrived O
in O
Moscow B-GPE

Tmac B-PERSON

problem O
is O
actually O
very O
simple O

that O
is O
: O

who O
do O

pass O
the O
university O
entrance O
exam O
and O
are O
wasting O
their O
days O
at O
home O

anything O

With O
a O
bit O
of O
" O

up O

everything O
will O
be O
okay O

Wrong O
! O

With O
a O
huge O
chunk O
of O
cash O
spent O
, O
the O
frightening O
thing O
is O
that O
the O
payoff O
falls O
far O
short O
of O
expectations O

Even O
more O
frightening O
is O
that O
it O

I O
've O
been O
in O
France B-GPE
for O
several O
years O

What O
I O
have O
experienced O
myself O
or O
, O
even O
more O
, O
what O
I O
have O
seen O
are O
the O
countless O
who O
have O
given O
up O
their O
studies O
year O
by O
year O
, O
those O
with O
wrecked O
health O
everywhere O
, O
those O
who O
sold O
their O
souls O
and O
even O
those O
who O
lost O
their O
lives O
. O

Overseas O
study O
is O
a O
splendid O
term O
, O
but O
in O
return O
it O
demands O
youth O
, O
effort O
and O
staunch O
perseverance O
, O
as O
well O
as O
sufficient O
rationality O
. O

Life O
is O
never O
a O
bed O
of O
roses O
in O
any O
location O
, O
even O
more O
in O
a O
foreign O

where O
there O
is O
a O

Grandma B-PERSON
came O
in O
the O
morning O
. O

Qingqing O
got O
up O
and O
put O
on O
clothes O
by O
himself O
, O
and O
then O
went O
to O
the O
kindergarten O
with O
Grandma B-PERSON
, O

He O
still O
had O
Cola B-PRODUCT

Juan I-PRODUCT
Juan I-PRODUCT

for O
breakfast O
and O
left O
after O
finishing O
eating O
, O

He O
left O
quite O
early O
today O
; O
Grandma B-PERSON
said O
she O
wanted O
to O
see O
Qingqing B-PERSON
do O
physical O
exercise O
today O
. O

He O
did O
not O
want O
to O
eat O
dinner O
in O
the O
evening O
, O

Grandpa B-PERSON
said O
he O
ate O
only O
half O
a O
yam O
, O

There O
was O
still O
yam O
in O
Qingqing B-PERSON
's O
bowl O
, O

In O
the O
end O
, O
the O
yam O
was O
eaten O
, O
but O
the O
rice O
was O
left O
over O
. O

Grandma B-PERSON
said O
Qingqing B-PERSON
practiced O
the O
keyboard O
right O
after O
he O
came O
home O
today O
and O
played O
very O
well O
. O

He O
is O
already O
very O
good O
at O
playing O
" O
Three B-WORK_OF_ART

" O

Back O
then O
Sister O
Yaoyao B-PERSON
was O
so O
frustrated O
by O
this O
tune O
too O
that O
she O
cried O
out O
of O
desperation O
. O

Qingqing B-PERSON
played O
the O
keyboard O
and O
pulled O
Dad B-PERSON
over O
: O
" O
I O
want O
to O
play O
it O
for O
Dad B-PERSON
to O
hear O
. O
" O

By O
the O
side O
, O
Dad B-PERSON
listened O
to O
Qingqing B-PERSON
playing O
, O

Grandma B-PERSON
also O
came O
over O
to O
listen O
to O
Qingqing B-PERSON
play O
, O
and O
also O
counted O
the O
beat O
, O

Qingqing B-PERSON
sat O
on O
the O
mat O
with O
his O
back O
very O
straight O
. O

Grandma B-PERSON
said O
this O
was O
better O
for O
Qingqing B-PERSON
's O
health O
. O

Qingqing B-PERSON
also O
practiced O
very O
seriously O
. O

Grandma B-PERSON
said O
we O
should O
not O
give O
Qingqing B-PERSON
things O
to O
eat O
at O
night O
and O
must O
care O
for O
Qingqing B-PERSON
's O
teeth O
, O

Grandma B-PERSON
said O
to O
Qingqing B-PERSON
: O
" O
If O
your O
Dad O
gives O
you O
things O
to O
eat O
again O
at O
night O
, O
I O
will O
not O
allow O
your O

to O
take O
you O
home O
. O
" O

Qingqing B-PERSON
said O
no O
and O
wanted O
to O
go O
home O
, O

Mom B-PERSON
said O
: O
" O
How O
about O
Grandma B-PERSON
stays O
in O
our O
home O
, O
is O
that O
okay O
? O
" O

Qingqing B-PERSON
did O
not O
agree O
: O
" O
That O
's O
my O
home O
. O

Grandma B-PERSON
has O
her O
own O
home O
. O

Why O
does O
she O
have O
to O
come O
to O
our O
home O

" O

Grandma B-PERSON
said O
: O
" O
Your O

is O
my O
son O
. O

Why O
could O
n't O
I O
stay O
in O
your O

ah O
? O
" O

Qingqing B-PERSON
thought O
for O
a O
moment O
: O
" O
Grandma B-PERSON
, O
let O
me O
tell O
you O
, O
there O

What O
was O
Saddam B-PERSON
prosecuted O
for O
? O

Earlier O
on O
, O
Iran B-GPE
's O
involvement O
with O
the O
Euro B-MONEY
- O
for O
- O
oil O
transactions O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
big O
news O
item O
with O
negligible O
after O
- O
effects O
, O
and O
finally O
it O
became O
a O
non-issue O
, O
and O
hence O
there O
was O
no O
problem O
for O
Iran B-GPE
and O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
. O

But O
this O
time O
, O
Putin B-PERSON
came O
up O
with O
a O
Ruble B-MONEY
- O
for O
- O
oil O
proposal O
, O
and O
even O
began O
intensive O
preparations O
. O

Nobody O
would O
have O
any O
doubts O
about O
the O
technical O
capacity O
of O
Russia B-GPE
, O
not O
to O
mention O
its O
ability O
to O
protect O
its O
own O
resources O
and O
trade O
systems O
, O

The O
intimidation O
that O
Russia B-GPE
had O
inflicted O
on O
Ukraine B-GPE
is O
still O
remembered O
with O
a O
tinge O
of O
fear O
by O
some O
European B-NORP
brother O
- O
like O
countries O
. O

The O
Ruble B-MONEY
is O
allowed O
to O
float O
freely O
now O
, O
but O
everyone O
still O
has O
sufficient O
reasons O
to O
doubt O
the O
replacement O
of O
the O
US B-NORP
dollar O
in O
Dollar B-MONEY
- O
for O
- O
oil O
. O

But O
what O
was O
more O
vicious O
about O
Comrade O
Putin B-PERSON
was O
that O
he O
had O
rolled O
out O
what O
is O
known O
as O
a O
" O
barbarous O
" O
gold O
system O
; O
and O
that O
is O
, O
before O
the O
wide O
acceptance O
of O
the O
Ruble B-MONEY
- O
for O
- O
oil O
, O
a O
portion O
of O
Russia B-GPE
's O
annual O
oil O
revenues O
would O
be O
channeled O
toward O
increasing O
the O
country O
's O
holdings O
of O
gold O
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
among O
all O
major O
countries O
to O
have O
issued O
such O
a O
clear O
proclamation O
- O
no O
wonder O
the O
recent O
link O
between O
gold O
and O
oil O
had O
almost O
been O
severed O
. O

As O
for O
Mao B-PERSON
Zedong I-PERSON
being O
" O
forgotten O
even O
by O
the O
common O
people O
" O
, O
" O
scholars O
who O
study O
Chinese B-NORP
politics O
" O
will O
probably O
have O
to O
patiently O
wait O
for O
a O
period O
of O
time O
. O

Furthermore O
that O
period O
of O
time O
might O
still O
be O
very O
long O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
something O
we O
can O
do O
anything O
about O
. O

If O
we O
make O
the O
" O
symbol O
of O
a O
society O
's O
progress O
" O
a O
country O

founding O
leaders O
being O
forgotten O
by O
their O
own O
citizens O
to O
the O
extent O
that O
they O
are O
" O
forgotten O
even O
by O
the O
common O
people O
" O
, O
then O
, O
first O
of O
all O
, O
I O
think O
the O
Americans B-NORP
would O
n't O
be O
able O
to O
do O
it O
, O

We O
can O
not O
imagine O
that O
the O
Americans B-NORP
, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
" O
social O
progress O
" O
, O
would O
render O
Washington B-PERSON
" O
forgotten O
even O
by O
the O
common O
people O
" O
. O

America B-GPE
's O
capital O
would O
have O
to O
change O
its O
name O
. O

At O
least O
China B-GPE
does O
n't O
have O
a O
" O
Mao B-PERSON
Zedong I-PERSON
City O
" O
. O

I O
think O
on O
the O
contrary O
that O
it O
's O
not O
whether O
Mao B-PERSON
Zedong I-PERSON
has O
been O
" O
forgotten O
even O
by O
the O
common O

" O
, O
but O
rather O
that O
certain O
people O
and O
certain O
powers O
are O
too O
anxious O
and O
too O
impatient O
. O

Each O
time O
September B-DATE

comes O
around O
, O
they O
unaccountably O
fix O
their O
gaze O
on O
the O
" O

" O
in O
" O
China B-GPE
's O
official O

" O
and O
then O
make O
a O
fuss O
over O
it O
, O

Does O
n't O
this O
illustrate O
perfectly O
that O
Mao B-PERSON
Zedong I-PERSON
can O
in O
no O
way O
be O
" O
forgotten O
even O
by O
the O
common O
people O
" O
, O

That O
's O
because O
those O
people O
who O
fervently O
hope O
that O
Mao B-PERSON
Zedong I-PERSON
will O
be O
" O
forgotten O
even O
by O
the O

" O
are O
forever O

Twenty B-QUANTITY

some O

Regardless O
of O
whether O
it O
is O
voices O
of O
eulogy O
or O
words O
uttered O
in O

it O
all O

that O

China B-GPE
Mao B-PERSON

is O
a O
great O
man O
who O

So O
what O
is O
this O
about O

" O

[] O
Many O
of O
the O
yaks O
in O

Only O

[] O
Yaks O
can O
be O
very O
curious O

[] O
In O

time O
it O
took O
for O
us O

out O

take O
a O
picture O

the O
yak O
suddenly O
turned O
its O

started O

[] O
It O
startled O

[] O
Without O

for O
me O

close O

he O
put O

backed O
up O
a O
hundred O

so O
meters O
in O
a O

[] O
We O
waited O
for O
the O

leisurely O
cross O
the O
road O

and O
climb O
a O
hillside O
before O
we O
continued O
to O
go O
on O

[] O
It O

true O
indeed O
, O
they O
are O
the O
landlords O

we O
were O

it O

[] O
The O

We O
finally O
saw O
the O

of O
the O
Minjiang O
River O

[] O
Like O
with O
all O
great O
rivers O

it O
is O
those O

clearly O

it O

also O

The O

by O
the O

In O
the O
face O
of O
criticism O
and O
nitpicking O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
Jesus B-PERSON
is O
weaker O
than O
Darwin B-PERSON
. O

Why O
? O

Because O
Darwin B-PERSON
was O
allowed O
to O
make O
mistakes O
, O
since O
he O
was O
a O
human O
being O
; O
but O
Jesus B-PERSON
was O
not O
allowed O
to O
make O
mistakes O
, O
since O
he O
had O
been O
described O
as O
God B-PERSON
. O

Darwin B-PERSON
proposed O
Evolution B-WORK_OF_ART
Theory I-WORK_OF_ART
, O
but O
it O
was O
just O
a O
theory O
, O
and O
he O
himself O
also O
admitted O
that O
there O
were O
many O
questions O
, O

Others O
may O
agree O
with O
him O
, O
or O
they O
may O
accept O
some O
parts O
while O
disagreeing O
with O
other O
parts O
, O
or O
in O
the O
future O
we O
might O
discover O
that O
the O
general O
direction O
of O
Darwin B-PERSON
's O
evolution O
is O
largely O
correct O
though O
filled O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
errors O
, O
and O
that O
there O
might O
be O
an O
improved O
version O
of O
evolution O
which O
is O
more O
accurate O
and O
comprehensive O
than O
what O
Darwin B-PERSON
had O
proposed O
. O

But O
as O
the O
originator O
, O
Darwin B-PERSON
deserves O
much O
credit O
. O

Jesus B-PERSON
is O
God B-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
Bible B-WORK_OF_ART
is O
the O
word O
of O
God B-PERSON
. O

God B-PERSON
creates O
everything O
, O
understands O
everything O
, O
predicts O
the O
future O
, O
and O
is O
infinitely O
resourceful O
, O
so O
how O
can O
he O
be O
wrong O
! O

Therefore O
, O
if O
you O
find O
a O
sentence O
that O
is O
allegedly O
said O
by O
God B-PERSON
, O
but O
effectively O
turns O
out O
to O
be O
wrong O
, O
then O
this O
god O
will O
be O
overthrown O
. O

Therefore O
, O
Jesus B-PERSON
is O
more O
vulnerable O
to O
criticism O
than O
Darwin B-PERSON
, O
because O
once O
an O
error O
is O
found O
, O
then O
he O
could O
not O
be O
the O
true O
god O
. O

Enterprise O

started O
with O

, O
and O
then O
the O
policy O
of O
" O
invigorating O
the O
large O
enterprises O
while O
relaxing O
control O
over O
the O
smaller O
ones O
" O
was O
implemented O
. O

Then O
through O
preferential O
policies O
and O
methods O
such O
as O
" O
substitution O
of O
tax O
payment O
for O
profit O
delivery O
, O
" O
" O
appropriation O
instead O
of O

, O
" O
" O
using O

to O
exchange O
for O
stocks O
, O
" O
" O
contracting O
, O
" O
and O
" O
joint O
capital O
, O
" O
small O
and O
medium O
- O
sized O
enterprises O
were O
basically O
transformed O
into O
different O
modes O
of O
ownership O
such O
as O
" O
privately O
owned O
, O
" O
" O
joint O
venture O
, O
" O
or O
joint O
stock O
systems O
. O

Now O
we O
have O
reached O
the O
stage O
of O
reforming O
and O
fortifying O
large O
state O
- O
owned O
enterprises O
. O

During O
the O
process O
of O
economic O
restructuring O
, O
economic O
theories O
such O
as O

" O
all O
began O
to O
make O
their O
presence O
one O
after O
another O
, O

Among O
the O
various O
theories O
, O
what O
stood O
out O
was O
the O

" O

Dominated O

. O

In O
the O

of O

off O
, O
state O

been O
greatly O

One B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
hypotheses O
states O
: O
a O
long O
time O
ago O
, O
in O
order O
to O
hide O
from O
wild O
beasts O
roaming O
on O
the O
land O
, O
humans O
had O
ever O
lived O
in O
shallow O
water O
regions O
for O
a O
long O
period O
of O
time O
, O
surviving O
on O
aquatic O
plants O
and O
fishes O
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
body O
hairs O
, O
which O
increased O
the O
friction O
in O
water O
, O
had O
fallen O
off O
. O

The O
reason O
for O
this O
explanation O
is O
that O
the O
fine O
hairs O
on O
the O
back O
of O
humans O
run O
from O
one O
side O
of O
the O
shoulder O
toward O
the O
spine O
, O
a O
different O
direction O
from O
that O
of O
monkeys O
. O

Only O
such O
a O
direction O
could O
reduce O
the O
friction O
in O
water O
, O
and O
provide O
more O
buoyancy O
for O
the O
person O
who O
is O
swimming O
in O
the O
water O
. O

However O
, O
in O
all O
the O
primitive O
gathering O
settlements O
that O
have O
been O
discovered O
so O
far O
, O
we O
have O
not O
seen O
any O
settlement O
where O
people O
lived O
in O
such O
a O
way O
. O

What O
is O
worse O
is O
-- O
from O
the O
perspective O
of O
the O
direction O
of O
the O
fine O
hairs O
as O
well O
-- O
the O
fine O
hairs O
on O
humans O
' O
upper O
arm O
point O
downward O
, O
while O
the O
fine O
hairs O
on O
the O
lower O
arm O
point O
upward O
, O
which O
is O
to O
say O
, O
they O
all O
run O
toward O
the O
elbow O
. O

This O
is O
somewhat O
similar O
to O
monkeys O
who O
have O
hairs O
: O
when O
it O
rains O
, O
they O
would O
hold O
their O
heads O
with O
their O
hands O
, O
and O
such O
a O
direction O
of O
their O
hairs O
would O
be O
easier O
for O
the O
rain O
to O
flow O
away O
along O
their O
elbows O

I O
, O
as O

do O

have O
much O

so O
when O
I O
listen O
to O

the O
best O
is O
purely O
to O
get O
away O
from O
reality O
, O
stuff O

it O

very O

You O
mention O
that O
I O
always O
had O
a O
very O
big O
question O
about O
The B-WORK_OF_ART
Water I-WORK_OF_ART
Margin I-WORK_OF_ART
. O

What O
's O
so O
good O
about O
this O
book O
on O
earth O
that O
it O
is O
grouped O
as O
one O
of O
the O
four O
great O
classic O
novels O
. O

There O
are O
excellent O
parts O
of O
the O
book O
, O
but O
as O
a O
novel O
, O
the O
makeup O
of O
characters O
is O
quite O
flawed O
. O

For O
example O
, O
this B-PERSON
Hu I-PERSON
San I-PERSON
Niang I-PERSON
, O
with O
all O
her O
loved O
ones O
recklessly O
slaughtered O
by O
Li B-PERSON
Kui I-PERSON
, O
if O
she O
had O
any O
guts O
at O
all O
, O
she O
should O
have O
fought O
it O
out O
with O
that O
guy O
. O

Yet O
she O
became O
sworn O
sister O
with O
her O
enemy O
and O
degraded O
herself O
by O
marrying O
a O
short O
ugly O
man O
. O

What O
is O
the O
hell O
going O
on O
here O
. O

This O
group O
of O
so O
- O
called O
heroes O
did O
some O
righteous O
deeds O
, O
but O
they O
did O
a O
lot O
of O
lousy O
things O
as O
well O
. O

By O
mentioning O
that O
, O
it O
's O
a O
lot O
like O
a O
novel O
about O
gangster O
lowlifes O
. O

If O
a O
boy O
uses O
this O
book O
as O
inspiration O
, O
it O
seems O
he O
would O
have O
a O
great O
chance O
of O
going O
down O
the O
road O
of O
a O
criminal O
lowlife O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
its O
historical O
themes O
, O
it O
diverges O
too O
much O
from O
real O
history O
. O

Song B-PERSON
Jiang I-PERSON
's O

not O
that O
awe O
- O
inspiring O
. O

It O
seems O
it O
was O
quelled O
by O
royalist O
Zhang B-PERSON
Shuye I-PERSON
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
The B-WORK_OF_ART

simply O
not O
on O
par O

Chairman O
Mao B-PERSON
was O
in O
charge O
of O
all O
the O
power O
that O
governed O
China B-GPE

From O
beginning O

all O

attest O
that O
only O

voice O
in O

late O

could O
shake O
China B-GPE

and O
could O
shake O

Yet O
, O
in O
terms O
of O
substance O
, O
what O
did O
he O
eat O
? O
What O
kinds O
of O
things O
did O
he O
use O
? O

There O
was O
braised O
pork O
in O

there O
were O
heavily O

and O
this O

Mao B-PERSON

... O

In O
sum O
, O
nothing O
can O
be O
found O
that O
was O
different O
from O
what O
ordinary O
people O
possessed O
. O

The O
changes O
in O
our O
business O
model O
on O
this O
occasion O
are O
that O
we O
want O
to O
promote O
our O
commercial O
edition O
CRM B-PRODUCT
System I-PRODUCT
-- I-PRODUCT
* I-PRODUCT
Easy I-PRODUCT
Client I-PRODUCT
CRM I-PRODUCT
* O
, O
and O
continue O
to O
retain O
and O
develop O
our O
open O
source O
CRM O
system O
-- O
C3CRM O
. O

We O
're O
certainly O
compelled O
to O
make O
this O
choice O
, O

Before O
we O
fully O
undertook O
C3CRM B-PRODUCT
, O
we O
had O
always O
felt O
that O
we O
would O
be O
able O
to O
survive O
in O
China B-GPE
by O
offering O
technical O
support O
and O
services O
. O

More O
than O
four B-DATE
months I-DATE
after O
we O
had O
established O
the O
company O
and O
officially O
gone O
into O
operation O
, O
we O
discovered O
that O
we O
thought O
wrong O
, O

Domestic O
enterprises O
are O
not O
all O
very O
willing O
to O
pay O
for O
services O
. O

Even O
if O
we O
had O
some O
service O
- O
paying O
customers O
, O
they O
would O
pay O
for O
a O
while O
and O
then O
no O
more O
. O

This O
was O
because O
they O
felt O
that O
they O
simply O
did O
not O
need O
our O
services O
and O
that O
by O
paying O
services O
fees O
every O
year O
they O
felt O
they O
would O
lose O
. O

So O
it O
is O
currently O
very O
difficult O
to O
rely O
on O
collecting O
fees O
for O
services O
in O
China B-GPE
. O

Chairman O
Pei B-PERSON
of O
shopex B-ORG
feels O
the O
same O
way O
. O

Previously O
, O
we O
wanted O
to O
collect O
fees O
for O
the O
vtiger B-PRODUCT
Chinese B-NORP
language O
packs O
, O
but O
faced O
opposition O
from O
some O
friends O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
those O
friends O
who O
had O
planned O
to O
use O
vtiger B-PRODUCT
Chinese B-NORP
Edition O
to O
earn O
money O
or O
gain O
profit O
were O
strongly O
opposing O
and O
carried O
out O
a O
trashy O
commentary O
attack O
against O
C3CRM B-PRODUCT
's O
blog O
. O

Some O
friends O
said O
that O
there O
was O
no O
notification O
at O
all O
prior O
to O
the O
translation O
and O
that O
they O
felt O
a O
bit O
cheated O
for O
collecting O
fees O
after O
the O
translation O
was O
done O
. O

Later O
on O
, O
we O
were O
compelled O
by O
pressure O
to O
renew O
the O
free O
distribution O
of O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
language O

. O

In O
the O
future O
, O
we O

" O
Zhu O
" O
means O
chopsticks O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
the O
pronunciation O
of O
chopsticks O
" O
zhu O
" O
also O
means O
" O
stop O
, O
" O
which O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
understand O
, O
since O
we O
use O
chopsticks O
to O
pick O
up O
food O
. O

It O
is O
just O
like O
Grandma B-PERSON
Liu I-PERSON
wanting O
to O
eat O
quail O
eggs O
. O

-LRB- O
Grandma B-PERSON
Liu I-PERSON
picked O
up O
the O
chopsticks O
, O
only O
felt O
that O
she O
could O
not O
master O
it O
, O
so O
she O
said O
, O
" O
The O
chickens O
here O
are O
so O
handsome O
, O
they O
also O
lay O
such O
small O
eggs O
, O
which O
are O
pretty O
handsome O
. O

Let O
me O
try O
one O
. O
" O

This B-PERSON
Grandma I-PERSON
Liu I-PERSON
was O
really O
straightforward O
yet O
humorous O
. O
-RRB- O

But O
another O
pronunciation O
" O
kuai O
" O
for O
chopstick O
just O
has O
the O
meaning O
of O
" O
quick O
, O
" O
which O
is O
just O
opposite O
in O
meaning O
with O
" O
stop O
" O
. O

It O
was O
said O
that O
boatmen O
felt O
that O
" O
stop O
" O
was O
unlucky O
, O
so O
they O
gave O
it O
an O
opposite O
name O
and O
called O
it O
accordingly O
. O

There O
is O
a O
proper O
way O
of O
setting O
up O
and O
laying O
down O
chopsticks O
: O
they O
must O
be O
of O
the O
same O
length O
; O
if O
the O
length O
is O
uneven O
, O
it O
has O
the O
meaning O
of O
really O
bad O
luck O
. O

People O
often O
use O
the O
expression O
" O
three B-QUANTITY
longs O
and O
two B-QUANTITY
shorts O
" O
to O
symbolize O
unpredictable O
changes O
; O
for O
instance O
, O
Sister B-PERSON
Feng I-PERSON
once O
said O
: O
" O
Just O
as O
there O
could O
be O
unpredicted O
winds O
and O
clouds O
in O
the O
sky O
, O
people O
too O
can O
experience O
misfortunes O
and O
fortunes O
at O
any O
time O
. O

At O
this O
little O
age O
, O
if O
I O
have O
any O
long O
or O
short O
because O
of O
this O
illness O
, O
then O
my O
time O
on O
earth O
would O
be O
meaningless O
! O
" O

The O
story O
goes O
that O
in O
ancient O
times O
there O
were O
no O
nails O
to O
seal O
coffins O
firmly O
, O
so O
after O
the O
lid O
was O
placed O
on O
a O
coffin O
, O
three B-QUANTITY
horizontal O
boards O
and O
two O
vertical O
boards O
would O
be O
used O
to O
tie O
the O
coffin O
up O
tightly O
. O

The O
horizontal O
boards O
are O
long O
while O
the O
vertical O
ones O
are O
short O
. O

Hence O
when O
the O
expression O
" O
three B-QUANTITY
longs O
and O
two B-QUANTITY
shorts O
" O
is O
mentioned O
, O
people O
are O
reminded O
of O
the O
sad O
event O
of O
somebody O
's O
death O
, O
which O
would O
move O
people O
to O
tears O
, O
and O
they O
would O
put O
down O
their O
chopsticks O
, O
as O
they O
do O
not O
feel O
like O
eating O
. O

In O
almost O
every O
sociology O
textbook O
, O
there O
is O
always O
a O
chapter O
entitled O
" O
Socialization O
" O
. O

" O
Socialization O
" O
is O
a O
core O
concept O
in O
sociology O
. O

Its O
meaning O
is O
a O
process O
in O
which O
people O
obtain O
their O
characters O
and O
take O
on O
behavioral O
patterns O
. O

Animal O
behavior O
is O
primarily O
inborn O
. O

Human O
behavior O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
is O
primarily O
acquired O
after O
birth O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
a O
newborn O
baby O
is O
still O
an O
animal O
and O
only O
becomes O
a O
person O
after O
undergoing O
" O
socialization O
" O
. O

Socialization O
primarily O
occurs O
during O
a O
person O
's O
growth O
development O
period O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
after O
a O
person O
reaches O
adulthood O
, O
he O
or O
she O
still O
has O
to O
undergo O
" O
resocialization O
" O
. O

If O
you O
follow O
the O
logic O
of O
sociologists O
forward O
, O
you O
will O
feel O
that O
it O
is O
closely O
reasoned O
and O
well O
argued O
. O

But O
there O
is O
one O
point O
that O
they O
do O
n't O
explain O
-- O
why O
is O
it O
that O
the O
acquired O
learning O
portion O
of O
animal O
behavior O
is O
small O
? O

Which O
of O
the O
physical O
characteristics O
in O
which O
humans O
differ O
from O
animals O
result O
in O
the O
smooth O
process O
of O
acquired O
learning O
? O

Why O
have O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
human O
individuals O
not O
rejected O
" O
socialization O
" O
? O

These O
are O
important O
questions O
, O
but O
they O
can O
not O
be O
explained O
by O
sociologists O
. O

I O
think O
that O
sometimes O
it O
is O
not O
a O
bad O
thing O
to O
be O
ticketed O
by O
Uncle B-ORG
Policeman I-ORG
. O

I O
remember O
reading O
a O
post O
by O
a O
fellow O
student O
, O
who O
said O
that O
he O
was O
in O
a O
very O
complicated O
frame O
of O
mind O
after O
seeing O
his O
parents O
taking O
off O
at O
the O
airport O
, O
and O
sped O
up O
to O
120 B-QUANTITY
miles O
on O
the O
highway O
while O
listening O
to O
Swan B-WORK_OF_ART
Lake I-WORK_OF_ART
. O

I O
have O
never O
driven O
on O
the O
highway O
, O
but O
this O
should O
have O
been O
speeding O
, O
right O
. O

I O
feel O
that O
he O
was O
extremely O
unlucky O
not O
to O
have O
encountered O
a O
police O
officer O
, O

Some O
things O
, O
some O
people O
are O
just O
this O
way O
. O

He O
always O
finds O
you O
when O
there O
is O
nothing O
wrong O
, O
but O
disappears O
whenever O
he O
is O
needed O
. O

In O
a O
word O
, O
this O
fellow O
student O
had O
the O
real O
bad O
luck O
not O
to O
have O
encountered O
a O
police O
officer O
. O

In O
the O
end O
, O
he O
drove O
faster O
and O
faster O
until O
finally O
at O
140 B-QUANTITY
miles O
, O
he O
sped O
off O
the O
highway O
and O
plunged O
into O
the O
woods O
. O

But O
fortunately O
, O
people O
's O
luck O
always O
tends O
to O
balance O
out O
. O

Although O
this O
fellow O
student O
did O
not O
encounter O
a O
police O
officer O
, O
at O
least O
he O
was O
not O
injured O
in O
the O
accident O
. O

It O
was O
said O
that O
he O
would O
have O
fallen O
into O
a O
river O
had O
he O
left O
the O
highway O
a O
moment O
later O
. O

So O
upon O
getting O
a O
ticket O
, O
just O
consider O
it O
the O
expense O
of O
averting O
a O
disaster O
. O

[] O
The O
United O
States O
is O
the O
most O
powerful O
nation O
in O
the O
world O
; O
so O
naturally O
the O
U.S. O
police O
are O
also O
the O
world O
's O
most O
powerful O
police O
. O

[] O
The O
United O

complex O

composition O
; O
hence O
the O
task O
of O
safeguarding O
the O
country O
's O
internal O
security O
is O
certainly O
an O
arduous O
one O
, O
and O
it O
can O
be O
imagined O
that O
a O
police O
force O
with O
advanced O
and O
powerful O
equipment O
is O
needed O
. O

[] O
Recently O
, O
the O
U.S. O
police O
could O
be O
said O
to O
be O
in O
the O
spotlight O
, O
and O
have O
repeatedly O
become O
the O
focus O
of O
media O
attention O
; O
however O
, O
what O
put O
them O
in O
the O
spotlight O
was O
not O
their O
heroic O
acts O
or O
their O
extraordinary O
contributions O
in O
protecting O
the O
security O
of O
the O
people O
. O

On O
the O

within O

[] O
The O
tragedy O
of O
a O
wedding O

turning O
into O

[] O
In O
the O
early O
morning O
on O
the O
25th O
of O
this O
month O

23 O

old O
Sean O

invited O
a O
group O

to O
a O
New O

nightclub O
for O
a O
happy O
gathering O
. O

[] O
This O
gathering O
had O
a O
special O
significance O
, O
as O
he O
was O
getting O
married O
that O
day O
, O
and O
the O
party O
was O
to O
allow O
him O
to O
bid O
farewell O
to O
his O
bachelorhood O
. O

[] O
Marriage O
is O
the O
greatest O
event O
in O
life O
, O
and O
Bell O
invited O
more O
than O
200 O
guests O
from O
all O
over O
the O
United O
States O
to O
New O
York O
to O
attend O
his O
wedding O
. O

[] O
However O
, O
he O
never O
thought O
that O
he O
would O
have O
to O
say O
goodbye O
to O
this O
world O
and O
end O
his O
young O
life O
the O
moment O
he O
stepped O
out O
of O
the O
nightclub O
. O

[] O
For O
Bell O
's O
family O
, O
the O
happiest O
event O
has O
unexpectedly O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
the O
most O
tragic O
one O
in O
the O
family O
. O

According O
to O
Mr. B-PERSON
Liu I-PERSON
, O
children O
who O
are O
bullied O
in O
schools O
is O
a O
possible O
reflection O
of O
the O
Japanese B-NORP
social O
norm O
of O
the O
strong O
bullying O
the O
weak O
; O
in O
Japan B-GPE
, O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
are O
in O
a O
weaker O
position O
, O
so O
they O
are O
easily O
the O
target O
of O
bullies O
, O
and O
the O
same O
applies O
to O
children O
: O

" O
Look O
, O
in O
Japan B-GPE
, O
a O
superior O
bullies O
his O
subordinates O
, O
a O
senior O
bullies O
a O
junior O
, O
and O
these O
simply O
are O
very O
normal O
cases O
; O
therefore O
bullying O
others O
is O
something O
born O
and O
bred O
natively O
in O
Japan B-GPE
. O
" O

Facing O
the O
issue O
of O
their O
children O
being O
bullied O
, O
Chinese B-NORP
parents O
have O
also O
raised O
different O
opinions O
. O

Miss B-PERSON
Hong I-PERSON
, O
who O
lives O
in O
Bunkyo B-GPE
- I-GPE
ku I-GPE
district O
, O
said O
, O
" O
When O
children O
are O
bullied O
in O
school O
, O
parents O
should O
not O
dismiss O
it O
; O
rather O
, O
they O
should O
immediately O
contact O
the O
teachers O
and O
other O
parents O
' O
support O
groups O
so O
as O
to O
resolve O
the O
issue O
through O
communications O
; O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
they O
have O
to O
clearly O
remember O
not O
to O
get O
into O
an O
argument O
, O
as O
this O
would O
be O
counter-productive O
. O
" O

Ms B-PERSON
Lee I-PERSON
, O
who O
already O
has O
three B-QUANTITY
children O
, O
said O
, O
" O
Whether O
the O
children O
are O
easily O
bulled O
in O
school O
or O
not O
also O
depends O
on O
the O
social O
skills O
of O
the O
parents O
. O
" O

Many O
Chinese B-NORP
parents O
themselves O
could O
not O
blend O
into O
Japanese B-NORP
society O
, O
and O
even O
try O
to O
avoid O
contact O
with O
other O
Japanese B-NORP
upon O
seeing O
them O
; O
under O
such O
a O
situation O
, O
how O
could O
their O
children O
blend O
in O
? O

Parents O
themselves O
are O
mirrors O
of O
their O
children O
's O
growth O
, O
so O
we O
ourselves O
have O
to O
step O
out O
and O
make O
friends O
, O
so O
that O
our O
children O
can O
voluntarily O
make O
friends O
with O
other O
Japanese B-NORP
children O
. O

When O
they O
have O
friends O
, O
they O
wo O
n't O
be O
so O
easily O
bullied O
. O

Why O
do O
humans O
want O
to O
raise O
offspring O
, O

Some O
say O
this O
is O
human O
nature O
, O

This O
is O
voiced O
from O
the O
perspective O
of O
natural O
human O
instinct O
. O

Yet O
from O
the O
perspective O
of O
human O
socialization O
, O
people O
in O
different O
historical O
periods O
saw O
things O
differently O
, O

For O
example O
, O
in O
China B-GPE
's O
period O
of O
feudalist O
society O
, O
it O
was O
called O
" O
raising O
children O
to O
provide O
for O
old O
age O
, O
" O

But O
when O
the O
retirement O
system O
in O
a O
society O
has O
gradually O
been O
established O
, O
this O
opinion O
no O
longer O
holds O
, O

Have O
n't O
some O
young O
people O
chosen O
so O
- O
called O
DINK O
families O
? O

Have O
n't O
some O
people O
chosen O
to O
be O
what O
they O
call O
single O
aristocrats O
? O

And O
on O
and O
on O
. O

Raising O
a O
child O
is O
a O
great O
hassle O
, O

A O
mother O
has O
to O
go O
through O
various O
kinds O
of O
pregnancy O
- O
related O
discomfort O
during O
pregnancy O
, O

During O
delivery O
, O
it O
takes O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
and O
energy O
if O
it O
is O
a O
natural O
birth O
, O

Sometimes O
she O
might O
suffer O
a O
cut O
on O
her O
belly O
. O

What O
are O
they O
doing O
this O
for O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
according O
to O
the O
opinion O
of O
mainstream O
economists O
, O
these O
women O
can O
only O
be O
great O
fools O
. O

[] O
Very O
soon O
it O
was O
noontime O
, O
and O
young O
Zhao O
parked O
his O
car O
in O
the O
rest O
area O
of O
the O
gas O
station O
, O

[] O
Next O
to O
it O
was O
a O
Pangpang O
Restaurant O
: O
" O
The O
food O
here O
's O
not O
bad O
, O
we O
always O
come O
here O
for O
lunch O
. O

I O
also O
know O
the O
boss O
well O
. O
" O

[] O
I O
let O
young O
Zhao O
be O
our O
host O
and O
order O
some O
real O
farmhouse O
dishes O
. O

[] O
But O
when O
the O
dishes O
came O
, O
I O
was O
knocked O
out O
. O

[] O
Wild O
mushrooms O
fried O
with O
duck O
. O

The O
taste O
was O
definitely O
out O
of O
the O
ordinary O
, O
the O
flavor O
of O
the O
wild O
mushrooms O
as O
it O
went O
into O
your O
mouth O
was O
unforgettable O
. O

[] O
For O
the O
locally O
famous O
Lian O
Mountain O
double O
- O
cooked O
pork O
, O
this O
big O
chunk O
of O
it O
was O
enough O
to O
fill O
me O
up O
. O

[] O
I O
like O
shredded O
pork O
in O
spicy O
sauce O
, O
and O
it O
was O
just O
a O
little O
too O
spicy O
. O

[] O
Spicy O
duck O
blood O
. O

Young O
Zhao O
said O
, O
this O
was O
made O
with O
fresh O
duck O
's O
blood O
, O
not O
with O
duck O
blood O
powder O
. O

[] O
Eh O
? O

There O
's O
duck O
blood O
powder O
? O

[] O
It O
sounded O
very O
dangerous O
. O

[] O
This O
fresh O
spicy O
duck O
blood O
had O
texture O
that O
was O
a O
little O
springy O
and O
very O
tender O
. O

But O
it O
was O
just O
spicy O
, O
too O
spicy O
! O

[] O
Besides O
these O
four O
dishes O
, O
there O
was O
a O
plate O
of O
green O
vegetables O
, O
plus O
a O
big O
tureen O
of O
soup O
. O

[] O
" O
It O
's O
too O
much O
, O
there O

only O
us O
two O
, O
how O
are O
we O
going O
to O
eat O
this O
? O
" O
[] O
I O
asked O
young O
Zhao O
as O
I O
looked O
at O
him O
in O
surprise O
. O

[] O
Several O
dishes O
, O
two O
bowls O
of O
rice O
and O
a O
tureen O
of O
soup O
all O
disappeared O
entirely O
after O
a O
few O
minutes O
of O
slurping O
! O

[] O
Young O
Zhao O
is O
a O
typical O
Sichuan O
man O
. O

He O
's O
not O
tall O
, O
quite O
skinny O
, O
but O
surprisingly O
, O
he O
really O
can O
eat O
. O

[] O
Okay O
, O
on O
this O
trip O
I O
am O
going O
to O
get O
some O
good O
food O

The O
food O
tastes O
best O
when O
you O

[] O
A O
high O
school O
teacher O
teaching O
chemistry O
in O
the O
United O
Kingdom O
has O
appealed O
to O
the O
Department O
of O
Education O
to O
allow O
the O
views O
and O
theories O
that O
God O
created O
everything O
and O
intellectual O
life O
created O
the O
world O
to O
be O
introduced O
into O
school O
to O
be O
taught O
to O
students O
together O
along O
with O
Darwin O
's O
theory O
of O
evolution O
, O
which O
has O
been O
dominating O
the O
scientific O
community O
since O
the O
19th O
century O
, O
and O
let O
students O
judge O
between O
right O
and O
wrong O
for O
themselves O
. O

[] O
The O
long O
- O
standing O
policy O
of O
British O
Department O
of O
Education O
has O
been O
that O
the O
theories O
such O
as O
God O
's O
creation O
are O
" O
unsuitable O
" O
for O
primary O
and O
secondary O
education O
. O

[] O
Critics O
have O
pointed O
out O
that O
some O
scholars O
from O
non-English O
countries O
actually O
have O
long O
mistranslated O
evolution O
theory O
and O
misinterpreted O
Darwin O
's O
original O
intent O
, O
and O
the O
translation O
itself O
has O
a O
natural O
development O
from O
low O
to O
high O
level O
, O
a O
falsehood O
with O
almost O
religious O
bearings O
. O

[] O
Also O
some O
Western O
scholars O
- O
such O
as O
paleontologists O
and O
archaeologists O
from O
the O
United O
Kingdom O
, O
France O
, O
and O
Germany O
in O
the O
19th O
and O
20th O
centuries O
- O
have O
long O
made O
use O
of O
the O
distorted O
theory O
of O
evolution O
and O
social O
Darwinism O
derived O
from O
the O
argument O
to O
attempt O
to O
prove O
their O
point O
that O
certain O
races O
are O
more O
advanced O
than O
others O
. O

After O
the O
collapse O
of O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
dictatorial O
regime O
, O
Iraqi B-NORP
religious O
forces O
had O
entered O
a O
period O
of O
revitalization O
and O
expansion O
, O

Although O
the O
distribution O
system O
of O
the O
new O
legislative O
power O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
had O
generally O
taken O
care O
of O
the O
interests O
of O
all O
parties O
, O
and O
found O
a O
relatively O
reasonable O
balance O
point O
among O
all O
ethnic O
groups O
and O
sects O
-- O
otherwise O
a O
management O
committee O
, O
the O
interim O
constitution O
, O
and O
the O
current O
interim O
government O
would O
not O
have O
been O
successfully O
generated O
-- O
this O
does O
not O
mean O
that O
there O
were O
no O
contradictions O
among O
them O
. O

From O
an O
internal O
point O
of O
view O
, O
Shiites B-NORP
and O
Kurds B-NORP
tend O
to O
see O
eye O
to O
eye O
on O
the O
political O
and O
economic O
benefits O
, O
and O
Iraqi B-NORP
politics O
had O
almost O
become O
the O
arena O
of O
these O
two O
factions O
, O

Although O
under O
the O
balance O
of O
interests O
some O
of O
Sunni B-NORP
political O
figures O
were O
involved O
in O
politics O
, O
what O
the O
Sunni B-NORP
radical O
groups O
were O
most O
concerned O
about O
was O
that O
the O
Shiites B-NORP
would O
turn O
around O
and O
suppress O
them O
in O
the O
future O
. O

In O
February B-DATE
of O
this O
year O
, O
a O
radical O
Sunni B-NORP
organization O
attacked O
the B-FAC
Ali I-FAC
Mosque I-FAC
, O
which O
is O
the O
religious O
shrine O
of O
Shiite B-NORP
Muslims I-NORP
, O
and O
this O
led O
to O
the O
eruption O
of O
the O
conflict O
between O
Iraq B-GPE
's O
two B-QUANTITY
largest O
parties O
. O

We O
ought O
to O
acknowledge O
that O
within O
the O
limits O
of O
a O
specific O
time O
, O
one O
can O
find O
things O
of O
positive O
significance O
in O
many O
events O
in O
the O
history O
. O

But O
take O
note O
, O
these O
things O
of O
positive O
significance O
are O
restricted O
by O
the O
premise O
of O
specific O
time O
. O

Extending O
these O
positive O
significances O
beyond O
that O
premise O
is O
totally O
meaningless O
. O

So O
that O
is O
why O
my O
sense O
of O
uncertainty O
has O
arisen O
. O

I O
clearly O
understand O
that O
the O
so O
- O
called O
" O
positive O
" O
significances O
referred O
to O
in O
The B-WORK_OF_ART
River I-WORK_OF_ART
Elegy I-WORK_OF_ART
only O
exist O
in O
a O
puerile O
fashion O
in O
that O
special O
period O
of O
time O
. O

So O
why O
to O
the O
contrary O
has O
this O
kind O
of O
puerile O
thing O
again O
unexpectedly O
become O
our O
survey O
pole O
and O
flag O
in O
a O
mature O
era O
far O
from O
that O
period O
? O

If O
it O
is O
not O
nonsense O
or O
for O
some O
ulterior O
motive O
, O
then O
we O
probably O
have O
to O
say O
that O
society O
really O
has O
significantly O
regressed O
. O

Does O
such O
a O
grown O
- O
up O
really O
keep O
turning O
back O
as O
he O
lives O
on O
? O

Regarding O
this O
as O
fine O
, O
but O
perhaps O
a O
different O
explanation O
is O
that O
society O
has O
not O
regressed O
, O
but O
just O
that O
there O
are O
some O
people O
who O
have O
not O
progressed O
, O

As O
for O
them O
, O
that O
's O
the O
way O
it O
is O
, O
and O
that O
was O
their O
zenith O
, O

Once O
that O
period O
was O
past O
, O
basically O
they O
became O
the O
same O
as O
those O
about O
to O
be O
buried O
, O
and O
they O
are O
getting O
worse O
day O
by O
day O
. O

Rice O
washing O
water O
is O
said O
to O
be O
a O
very O
good O
natural O
beauty O
product O
. O

Our O
grandmothers O
' O
generation O
uses O
it O
to O
wash O
their O
hair O
and O
faces O
. O

The O
head O
of O
our O
household O
also O
says O
that O
flowers O
watered O
with O
rice O
washing O
water O
grow O
exceptionally O
well O
. O

With O
decreasing O
consumption O
of O
rice O
, O
our O
family O
has O
fewer O
chances O
of O
coming O
into O
contact O
with O
rice O
washing O
water O
. O

When O
I O
was O
a O
kid O
, O
I O
felt O
it O
very O
fun O
watching O
the O
milk O
- O
like O
rice O
washing O
water O
flow O
out O
of O
the O
rice O
pot O
. O

The O
snow O
- O
white O
and O
fragrant O
jasmine O
flowers O
that O
grew O
out O
of O
the O
nourishment O
of O
rice O
washing O
water O
are O
also O
no O
longer O
seen O
. O

The O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
when O
I O
cooked O
rice O
on O
a O
clay O
stove O
as O
a O
kid O
, O
I O
burned O
it O
into O
a O
potful O
of O
charcoal O
. O

It O
also O
cost O
me O
a O
clay O
pot O
. O

In O
spite O
of O
some O
of O
my O
subsequent O
remedies O
such O
as O
using O
a O
section O
of O
the O
white O
parts O
of O
scallions O
to O
expel O
the O
burnt O
smell O
, O
adding O
some O
water O
and O
white O
rice O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
make O
it O
look O
better O
, O
I O
was O
still O
soundly O
scolded O
by O
my O
dear O
old O
mom O
. O

Nowadays O
, O
life O
is O
becoming O
simpler O
, O
more O
refined O
, O
and O
more O
convenient O
, O
yet O
I O
always O
feel O
that O
something O
is O
missing O
. O

stated O
at O
a O
routine O
news O
conference O
on O
the O
16th B-ORDINAL
that O
a O
report O
in O
The B-ORG
Washington I-ORG

about O
" O
a O

" O
was O
not O
factually O
true O
. O

The O
Chinese B-NORP
government O
very O
" O
skillfully O
" O
displayed O
a O
" O
cunning O
" O
ability O
to O
respond O
diplomatically O
. O

During O
the O
entire O
incident O
, O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
military O
did O
not O
say O
a O
word O
from O
start O
to O
finish O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
government O
first O
denied O
it O
, O
then O
later O
played O
it O
down O
. O

It O
was O
absolutely O
an O
attitude O
of O
" O
broaching O
a O
topic O
with O
a O
delicate O
touch O
" O
, O
in O
particular O
the O
phrase O
" O
the O
report O
was O
not O
factually O
true O
" O
. O

How O
very O
" O
cunning O
! O
" O

If O
the O
report O
contained O
just O
one O
point O
that O
was O
not O
factual O
, O
then O
" O
the O
report O
was O
not O
factually O
true O
" O
would O
be O
correct O
. O

It O
sounds O
like O
it O
negates O
everything O
, O
but O
in O
fact O
it O
does O
n't O
negate O
anything O
at O
all O
! O

This O
world O
is O
really O
" O
intriguing O
! O
" O

A O
large O
man O
holding O
a O
machine O
gun O
from O
a O
distance O
runs O
to O
a O
doorway O
of O
the O
home O
of O
a O
small O
man O
, O
then O
sees O
that O
the O
small O
man O
is O
holding O
a O
vegetable O
knife O
with O
which O
he O
is O
about O
to O
slice O
vegetables O
. O

Subsequently O
, O
it O
is O
that O
small O
man O
who O
is O
" O
threatening O
" O
the O
" O
security O
" O
of O
the O
large O
man O
?! O

How O
" O
democratic O
" O
this O
world O
really O
is O
! O

Whoever O
has O
strength O
has O
the O
" O
right O
of O
speech O
! O
" O

So O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
government O
has O
to O
be O
a O
little O
" O
cunning O
. O
" O

If O
China B-GPE
has O
twenty B-QUANTITY
of O
the O
world O
's O
most O
advanced O
aircraft O
carriers O
and O
one B-QUANTITY
of O
them O
encountered O
some O
ship O
or O
another O
outside O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
Harbor I-LOC
, O
I O
'm O
afraid O
that O
it O
would O
be O
the O
others O
who O
were O
threatening O
our O
security O
. O

That O
is O
the O
reality O
of O
this O
world O
. O

The O
assassination O
of O
the O
Lebanese B-NORP
Minister B-PERSON
of I-PERSON
Industry I-PERSON
has O
triggered O
off O
angry O
protests O
from O
supporters O
, O
plunging O
Lebanon B-GPE
into O
yet O
another O
precarious O
situation O
. O

In O
merely O
two B-QUANTITY
short O
years O
, O
this O
minister O
is O
the O
fifth B-ORDINAL
senior O
official O
to O
be O
assassinated O
; O
this O
shows O
that O
even O
after O
the O
forced O
withdrawal O
of O
Israeli B-NORP
troops O
, O
long O
- O
suffering O
Lebanon B-GPE
still O
has O
n't O
ushered O
in O
the O
peace O
that O
it O
hoped O
for O
yet O
. O

The B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
claimed O
that O
the O
Syrian B-NORP
government O
was O
the O
murderer O
, O
but O
Syria B-GPE
retorted O
by O
saying O
that O
the O
accusation O
was O
" O
totally O
without O
foundation O
, O
and O
in O
disregard O
of O
facts O
. O
" O

At O
this O
moment O
, O
the O
real O
murderer O
is O
probably O
tittering O
, O
but O
the O
world O
has O
clearly O
seen O
that O
any O
one O
of O
the O
regimes O
of O
Lebanese B-NORP
and O
Iraqi B-NORP
is O
more O
fragile O
than O
the O
other O
. O

The O
Western B-LOC
media O
said O
that O
in O
the B-DATE
" I-DATE
post-Bush I-DATE
" I-DATE
garbage I-DATE
era I-DATE
, O
countries O
like O
Iraq B-GPE
, O
Syria B-GPE
, O
and O
Lebanon B-GPE
will O
encounter O
a O
lot O
more O
good O
shows O
or O
terrible O
tragedies O
. O

And O
the O
people O
believed O
that O
. O

It O
is O
uncertain O
whether O
the O
Canadian B-NORP
Prime B-PERSON
Minister I-PERSON
had O
taken O
the O
political O
equivalent O
of O
Viagra B-PRODUCT
, O
or O
had O
lost O
his O
mind O
due O
to O
political O
biases O
, O
but O
he O
" O
lost O
his O
temper O
" O
several O
times O
in O
China B-GPE
during O
APEC B-EVENT
, O
and O
almost O
messed O
up O
his O
meeting O
with O
President O
Hu B-PERSON
. O

Fortunately O
President O
Hu B-PERSON
was O
magnanimous O
enough O
not O
to O
take O
it O
to O
heart O
, O
and O
gave O
him O
the O
honor O
of O
a O
15 B-QUANTITY
- O
minute O
meeting O
. O

However O
, O
when O
this O
fellow O
returned O
to O
his O
own O
country O
, O
he O
boasted O
recklessly O
by O
saying O
that O
his O
meeting O
with O
President O
Hu B-PERSON
had O
" O
important O
historical O
significance O
, O
" O
and O
even O
exaggerated O
by O
claiming O
it O
as O
his O
" O
major O
diplomatic O
achievement O
. O
" O

But O
those O
Canadian B-NORP
opponents O
already O
disgruntled O
with O
him O
, O
seeing O
through O
his O
tricks O
, O
could O
immediately O
tell O
that O
the O
meetings O
that O
President O
Hu B-PERSON
had O
such O
as O
with O
Bush B-PERSON
, O
Abe B-PERSON
, O
and O
Putin B-PERSON
all O
lasted O
over O
an O
hour O
; O
a O
mere O
15 B-QUANTITY
- O
minute O
meeting O
with O
you O
-- O
excluding O
the O
pleasantries O
and O
translations O
-- O
was O
no O
different O
from O
an O
extended O
hand O
- O
shake O
. O

Looking O
back O
at O
2006 B-DATE
, O
it O
can O
be O
found O
that O
when O
choosing O
collaboration O
partners O
in O
Chinese B-NORP
market O
, O
more O
and O
more O
multinational O
corporations O
turned O
to O
Baidu B-ORG
. O

Last O
month O
it O
was O
eBay B-ORG
, O
and O
before O
that O
, O
there O
was O
content O
provider O
MTV B-ORG
; O
IT O
hardware O
manufacturer O
Hewlett B-ORG
- I-ORG
Packard I-ORG
, O
IBM B-ORG

and O

manufacturer O
Nokia B-ORG
. O

Microsoft B-ORG
's O
choice O
of O
Baidu B-ORG
this O
time O
has O
yet O
again O
strengthened O
Baidu B-ORG
's O
brand O
name O
. O

Over O
the O
past O
one O
year O
, O
Baidu B-ORG
's O
brand O
name O
has O
established O
a O
polarization O
, O
where O
the O
strong O
becomes O
even O
stronger O
. O

Therefore O
, O
brand O
names O
have O
become O
an O
insurmountable O
barrier O
for O
pursuers O
. O

Multinational O
corporations O
' O
choice O
of O
Baidu B-ORG
was O
based O
on O
the O
selections O
of O
Baidu B-ORG
made O
by O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
market O
as O
well O
as O
Chinese B-NORP
netizens O
. O

According O
to O
the O
latest O
survey O
data O
released O
by O
iResearch B-ORG
, O
Baidu B-ORG
's O
market O
share O
has O
reached O
69 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
, O
while O
the O
market O
share O
of O
its O
major O
competitor O
Google B-ORG
has O
slipped O
to O
about O
19 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
in O
China B-GPE
. O

Recently O
, O
Google B-ORG
has O
raised O
doubts O
about O
the O
survey O
data O
. O

It O
is O
very O
possible O
that O
Google B-ORG
is O
worried O
about O
being O
marginalized O
. O

According O
to O
a O
report O
by O
the O
Spanish B-NORP
newspaper O
Rebellion B-ORG
today O
, O
declassified O
documents O
from O
the O
US B-NORP

One O

The O

what O
they O
called O

" O

The O

In O

On O
March B-DATE
31 I-DATE
, I-DATE
1964 I-DATE
, O
President O
Goulart B-PERSON
was O
overthrown O
by O
a O
military O
coup O
, O
and O
since O
then O
a O
military O
dictatorship O
regime O
had O
been O
established O
in O
Brazil B-GPE
, O
which O
witnessed O
five B-QUANTITY
military O
presidents O
. O

Goulart B-PERSON
handed O
over O
power O
without O
resisting O
and O
died O
in O
1976 B-DATE
during O
exile O

It O
was O
not O
until O
1985 B-DATE
that O
the O
constitutional O
system O
was O
restored O
in O
Brazil B-GPE
and O
Sarney B-PERSON

Limbering O
up O
after O
training O
is O
very O
important O
! O

Today O
team O
members O
and O
I O
played O
a O
one B-CARDINAL
- O
against O
- O
two B-CARDINAL
exercise O
of O
offensive O
and O
defensive O
technique O
. O

I O
led O
Chen O
Long/Zhou O
Wenlong O
in O
practice O
. O

Since O
I O
became O
a O
coach O
, O
I O
have O
had O
little O
time O
to O
take O
on O
the O
court O
and O
play O
a O
match O
with O
team O
members O
because O
once O
the O
coaches O
step O
onto O
the O
court O
, O
the O
other O
team O
members O
will O
stop O
to O
watch O
us O
play O
and O
wo O
n't O
carry O
out O
their O
training O
duties O
very O
well O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
stepped O
onto O
a O
court O
for O
a O
long O
time O
and O
I O
thought O
I O
might O
not O
be O
able O
to O
play O
a O
full O
fifty B-QUANTITY
minutes O
. O

Once O
I O
started O
playing O
, O
I O
played O
fine O
, O
hey O
, O
and O
my O
speed O
was O
still O
pretty O
good O
, O
so O
when O
I O
led O
them O
in O
play O
together O
the O
atmosphere O
was O
really O
good O
. O

I O
played O
for O
fifty B-QUANTITY
minutes O
in O
one B-QUANTITY
sitting O
. O

Afterwards O
when O
I O
rested O
a O
bit O
I O
felt O
a O
bit O
tired O
and O
my O
body O
also O
reacted O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
aching O
pain O
. O

But O
I O
really O
enjoyed O
myself O
! O

After O
training O
, O
you O
have O
to O
remember O
to O
limber O
up O
! O

It O
is O
really O
important O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
do O
a O
good O
job O
in O
limberring O
up O
, O
it O
will O
affect O
your O
training O
in O
the O
next O
day O
! O

Power O
is O
produced O
by O
the O
contraction O
of O
muscle O
. O

After O
vigorous O
exercise O
, O
muscles O
will O
also O
become O
excessively O
tired O
. O

So O
if O
you O
want O
them O
to O
recover O
, O
you O
have O
to O
make O
them O
regain O
their O
elasticity O
. O

We O
have O
to O
help O
them O
by O
putting O
pressure O
on O
the O
ligaments O
and O
make O
muscles O
that O
have O
contracted O
too O
much O
following O
vigorous O
exercise O
regain O
their O
elasticity O
by O
stretching O
them O
. O

This O
is O
what O
we O
call O
limbering O
up O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
allow O
your O
muscles O
to O
loosen O
up O
and O
recover O
each O
time O
after O
training O
, O
eventually O
you O
will O
get O
an O
injury O
. O

This O
is O
Wu O
Bangguo O
's O
second O
visit O
to O
Hong O
Kong O
. O

[] O
After O
he O
arrived O
in O
Hong O
Kong O
on O
the O
2nd O
, O
he O
twice O
stressed O
that O
the O
current O
economy O
and O
people O
's O
livelihood O
in O
Hong O
Kong O
are O
much O
improved O
compared O
with O
the O
last O
time O
he O
visited O
Hong O
Kong O
in O
2000 O
. O

[] O
Six O
years O
ago O
, O
Wu O
Bangguo O
visited O
Hong O
Kong O
in O
a O
position O
of O
Vice O
Premier O
. O

[] O
Wu O
Bangguo O
's O
main O
task O
on O
his O
visit O
to O
Hong O
Kong O
this O
time O
was O
to O
preside O
over O
the O
" O
Telecom O
World O
Expo O
2006 O
" O
that O
opened O
on O
the O
3rd O
. O

[] O
Upon O
arriving O
in O
Hong O
Kong O
, O
he O
first O
gave O
a O
brief O
speech O
at O
the O
airport O
, O
stating O
in O
clear O
terms O
that O
his O
purpose O
of O
this O
visit O
to O
Hong O
Kong O
was O
to O
preside O
over O
the O
opening O
ceremony O
of O
the O
Telecom O
World O
Expo O
. O

The O
company O
that O
I O
previously O
worked O
at O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
encouraged O
employees O
to O
take O
the O
test O
for O
their O
drivers O
' O
licenses O
. O

The O
result O
was O
that O
the O
companies O
had O
a O
pile O
of O
drivers O
who O
possessed O
drivers O
' O
licenses O
but O
did O
not O
know O
how O
to O
drive O
because O
, O
although O
having O
passed O
the O
driver O
's O
test O
, O
they O
had O
too O
little O
actual O
experience O
on O
the O
road O
and O
were O
afraid O
of O
driving O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
take O
a O
road O
test O
in O
the O
US B-GPE
either O
so O
I O
'm O
not O
clear O
how O
it O
's O
actually O
done O
. O

But O
in O
these O
last O
couple O
of O
days O
I O
have O
read O
articles O
about O
road O
tests O
posted O
by O
other O
people O
and O
I O
sensed O
that O
the O
test O
in O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
was O
primarily O
to O
test O
for O
safety O
awareness O
, O

Americans B-NORP
probably O
feel O
that O
there O
's O
not O
much O
to O
test O
for O
technical O
driving O
skills O
since O
most O
cars O
are O
automatic O
vehicles O
, O
and O
who O
would O
not O
be O
able O
to O
learn O
it O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
it O
is O
safety O
awareness O
that O
is O
the O
standard O
for O
detecting O
whether O
a O
driver O
will O
threaten O
his O
own O
life O
or O
the O
life O
of O
anybody O
else O
. O

A O
friend O
once O
told O
me O
that O
his O
classmate O
who O
had O
three B-QUANTITY
years O
of O
driving O
experience O
in O
mainland O
China B-GPE
had O
to O
take O
the O
road O
test O
seven B-CARDINAL
times O
before O
he O
finally O
passed O
it O
in O
the O
US B-GPE
. O

I O
think O
that O
after O
driving O
for O
three B-QUANTITY
years O
the O
classmate O
was O
surely O
able O
to O
drive O
a O
car O
very O
well O
, O
but O
the O
problem O
was O
precisely O
that O
he O
drove O
too O
well O
, O
he O
had O
a O
hard O
time O
adapting O
from O
no O
rules O
to O
rules O
. O

I O
think O
the O
high O
requirements O
placed O
in O
mainland O
China B-GPE
on O
the O
driver O
's O
technical O
skills O
are O
due O
to O
the O
large O
number O
of O
people O
who O
do O
not O
observe O
regulations O
. O

On O
the O
road O
, O
it O
is O
very O
normal O
to O
see O
people O
suddenly O
dart O
out O
, O
so O
good O
technical O
skills O
are O
indispensable O
. O

In O
the O
small O
cities O
here O
, O
there O
are O
few O
people O
along O
the O
big O
avenues O
, O
so O
there O
's O
no O
need O
to O
be O
too O
worried O
about O
such O
things O

When O
comparing O
, O
you O
will O
find O
there O
is O
an O
extremely O
sharp O
contrast O
between O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
countries O
of O
China B-GPE
and O
the O
US B-GPE
on O
the O
issue O
of O
tipping O
, O

Those O
who O
assuredly O
take O
tips O
in O
the O
US B-GPE
are O
precisely O
those O
who O
in O
China B-GPE
are O
not O
allowed O
to O
take O
tips O
. O

In O
China B-GPE
, O
notices O
are O
posted O
in O
many O
restaurants O
, O
and O
even O
massage O
parlors O
, O
prohibiting O
attendants O
from O
accepting O
tips O
from O
customers O
; O

However O
, O
those O
who O
are O
allowed O
to O
take O
tips O
in O
China B-GPE
are O
precisely O
those O
who O
are O
not O
allowed O
to O
take O
tips O
in O
the O
US B-GPE
. O

If O
doctors O
or O
journalists O
in O
the O
US B-GPE
are O
known O
by O
the O
others O
to O
have O
accepted O
" O
red O
envelopes O
, O
" O
they O
should O
plan O
to O
never O
work O
in O
these O
professions O
again O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
their O
lives O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
the O
gap O
between O
the O
poor O
and O
the O
rich O
, O
it O
is O
much O
wider O
in O
China B-GPE
than O
in O
the O
US B-GPE
, O

A O
government O
employee O
in O
the O
US B-ORDINAL
makes O
50,000 B-MONEY
US I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
a O
year O
, O
and O
working O
class O
people O
like O
waiters O
can O
also O
make O
30,000 B-MONEY
US I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
. O
Taxi O
drivers O
make O
even O
more O
. O

Yet O
in O
China B-GPE
, O
a O
government O
employee O
makes O
50,000 B-MONEY
RMB I-MONEY
, O
and O
a O
waiter O
can O
only O
make O
about O
10,000 B-MONEY
RMB I-MONEY
. O

As O
a O
comparison O
, O
why O
do O
n't O
people O
show O
care O
and O
consideration O
to O
government O
employees O
, O
doctors O
, O
teachers O
, O
and O
journalists O
in O
the O
US B-GPE
, O
and O
to O
attendants O
in O
China B-GPE
, O

I O
met O
with O
the O
mayor O
of O
Iowa B-GPE
City O
. O

He O
is O
prohibited O
by O
statute O
from O
accepting O
gifts O
and O
hospitality O
valued O
at O
more O
than O
2.99 B-MONEY

In O

n't O
even O
treat O
him O
to O
a O

a O

His O
life O

" O
it O
