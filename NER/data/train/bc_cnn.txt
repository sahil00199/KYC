the O

I O
sort O

offer O
this O

talk O

just O
start O
the O

I O
guess O

I O
grew O

remind O
my O

they O
have O
to O
be O
willing O

speak O

think O
the O
secret O
keeping O

all O

you O

You O

they O
learn O
of O
the O
side O

first B-ORDINAL

that O

combat O

nothing O

finding O

gaining O
a O

So O
what O
you O
want O
to O
do O

learn O
of O
the O
side O

that O
you O
can O
do O
certain O
things O
for O
yourself O
to O
combat O
them O

Um O

that O
's O
really O
between O
you O

your O
doctor O
to O
try O
to O
find O
your O
way O
through O
um O
those O
side O
effects O
/. O

I O
mean O
you O
know O
what O
a O
terrible O
thing O
to O
be O
menopausal O
/. O

If O
that O
means O
no O
children O
in O
your O
future O
that O
could O
you O
know O
have O
a O
devastating O
effect O
/. O

But O
you O
should O
know O
all O
these O
things O
going O
in O
and O
then O
just O
take O
them O
one O
at O
a O
time O
with O
your O

work O

Rusty B-PERSON

a O

you O

So O
uh O
as O
devastating O
as O
it O
is O
you O
're O
really O
kind O

fortunate O

once O
you O
take O
out O
the O
plaster O

once O
you O
take O
out O
the O
insulation O
make O
sure O
that O
the O
inside O

the O

is O
dry O
uh O
the O

what O

Once O

people O
watching O
what O
's O
going O
on O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
have O
to O
ask O
is O
there O
an O
end O
to O
this O
/? O

Clearly O
there O
is O
an O
end O
to O
this O
/. O

the O
end O
comes O
when O
Iraqi B-NORP
security O
forces O
and O
Iraqi B-NORP
governance O
come O
together O
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
they O
're O
able O
to O
dominate O
the O

/. O

the O
end O
comes O
when O
the O
insurgency O
clearly O
understands O
and O
recognizes O
that O
they O
ca O
n't O
achieve O
any O
progress O
, O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
can O
achieve O
is O
killing O
innocent O
people O
/. O

And O
so O
I O
am O
very O
uh O
clear O
in O
my O
understanding O
that O
we O
're O
moving O
in O
a O
good O
direction O
as O
long O
as O
politics O
moves O
forward O
and O
Iraqi B-NORP
security O
forces O
moves O
forward O
/. O

But O
I O
'm O
also O
very O
realistic O
in O
understanding O
that O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
violence O
ahead O
especially O
as O
we O
move O
through O
the O
political O
process O
and O
the O
insurgence O
will O
try O
to O
challenge O
the O
government O
and O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
security O
forces O
and O
American B-NORP
forces O
in O
an O
effort O
to O
break O
our O
will O
and O
they O
do O
this O
by O
grabbing O
headlines O
/. O

So O
what O
I O
hear O
you O
saying O
is O
that O
the O
United B-GPE
States I-GPE
military O
alone O
ca O
n't O
crush O
this O
insurgency O
/. O

I O
did O
n't O
say O
the O
United B-GPE
States I-GPE
military O
alone O
ca O
n't O
crush O
this O
insurgency O
/. O

I O
wanted O
to O
make O
clear O
that O
crushing O
the O
insurgency O
has O
to O
do O
with O
a O
combination O
of O
politics O
economics O
military O
activity O
and O
diplomatic O
activity O
/. O

Would O
it O
make O
any O
difference O
uh O
let O
me O
rephrase O
the O
question O
if O
the O
US B-GPE
had O
another O
hundred B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
troops O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
/? O

what O
we O
have O
to O
do O
is O
have O
the O
right O
number O
of O
troops O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
/. O

We O
have O
the O
right O
number O
of O
troops O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
/. O

We O
have O
to O
build O
Iraqi B-NORP
security O
forces O
so O
they O
are O
capable O
of O
taking O
the O
lead O
in O
the O
counter-insurgency O
operation O
/. O

The O
strategy O
really O
is O
pretty O
simple O
/. O

and O
it O
's O
pretty O
elegant O
/. O

and O
general O
Casey B-PERSON
has O
done O
a O
great O
job O
in O
developing O
it O
/. O

We O
develop O
Iraqi B-NORP
security O
forces O
/. O

we O
continue O
to O
give O
them O
experience O
/. O

we O
connect O
the O
chain O
of O
command O
/. O

we O
build O
good O
leadership O
/. O

and O
over O
time O
they O
take O
the O
lead O
in O
the O
counter-insurgency O
fight O
/. O

The O
insurgents O
ca O
n't O
beat O
us O
/. O

we O
are O
very O
strong O
militarily O
/. O

there O
seems O
to O
be O
some O
notion O
out O
there O
that O
we O
're O
going O
to O
be O
pushed O
into O
the O
sea O
/. O

That O
's O
not O
going O
to O
be O
anything O
even O
close O
to O
what O
you O
might O
see O
/. O

But O
I O
assume O
they O
think O
that O
if O
they O
keep O
this O
drum O
beat O
this O
deadly O
series O
of O
suicide O
bombings O
IED's O
improvised O
explosive O
devices O
, O
if O
they O
just O
keep O
killing O
a O
lot O
of O
individuals O
Americans B-NORP
and O
Iraqis B-NORP
, O
eventually O
the O
American B-NORP
public O
will O
get O
fed O
up O
and O
the O
US B-GPE
will O
pull O
out O
/. O

Look O
/. O

there O
's O
only B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
way O
for O
the O
insurgents O
to O
win O
/. O

that O
's O
to O
drive O
us O
out O

we O

they O

giving O
their O

away O
from O

At O
first O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
say O
that O
there O
are O
historic O
links O

uh O
we O
have O
been O

And O
if O
you O
look O
at O
the O

you O
see O
that O
uh O
we O
have O
the O
sea O

we O
have O
Syria B-GPE

most O
of O
our O
borders O

uh O
in O
the O

So O
we O
have O
to O
be O
on O
very O
good O
terms O
with O
Syria B-GPE

continue O
to O
do O
that O
/. O

Mr. O
President O
uh O
there O
have O

assassinations O

these O
assassinations O

do O
you O
/? O

Well O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
that O
the O
ones O
that O
did O
this O
abominable O
assassination O
uh O
against O
late O
prime O

the O
enemies O

And O
they O
want O
to O
do O
harm O

And O
who O
could O
be O
the O
enemies O
who O
benefited O
from O
that O
/? O

For O
sure O
it O
's O
not O
Lebanon B-GPE

Syria B-GPE
because O
until O
the O
assassination O
everything O
was O
fine O

the O
stability O

were O

what O

we O
lost O

it O

I O
'm O

it O
could O

must O

the O
enemies O

you O
see O

Well O
it O
could O
be O
one B-CARDINAL

First B-ORDINAL
we O
had O
troubles O

we O
put O

was O

Eh O
and O
at O
this O
time O
we O
were O

we O
did O

We O
said O

they O

listen O

That O
would O

the O
reasons O

There O

we O

He O
suggests O
that O
there O

you O
totally O
disagree O

the O
possibility O
that O
Syrian B-NORP
intelligence O
may O

the O

why O

do O

only B-DATE

As O
you O
know O
we O
have O
still O

and O
it O
could O
be O
that O
they O
are O
trying O

we O

why O
do O
they O
say O
that O
it O
was O

did O

this O
uh O

for O

the O
majority O

We O
still O

this O

you O
can O

it O
must O

the O

because O

it O

and O
it O
should O

be O

All O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
that O
still O
Lebanon B-GPE
is O
at O
war O

it O

not O
at O

As O
you O
know O

they O

one O

And O
this O
is O
a O
very O
grave O

Lebanese B-NORP
consider O

there O

So O
all O
these O
problems O
have O

So O
it O

up O
to O
the O
Lebanese B-NORP

decide O

not O

I O
do O

I O

right O
I O
asked O

ah O
this B-DATE
past I-DATE

about O

Here O
's O
what O
he O
had O
to O

the O
above O
the O
law O
thing O
is O
a O
little O
gratuitous O
ah O
I O
think O
/. O

Ah O
I O
mean O
the O
law O
presented O
Judy B-PERSON
Miller I-PERSON
with O
a O
choice O
she O
could O
betray O
her O
trust O
ah O
or O
she O
could O
go O

and O
she O
took O
what O
I O
believe O
is O
the O
brave O
and O
honorable O
choice O
/. O

she O
went O
to O
jail O
/. O

we O
ran O
out O
of O
law O

Could O
you O
have O
been O
subpeonaed O
ah O
and O
threatened O
with O
jail O
during O
Watergate B-EVENT
/. O

or O
was O
the O
climate O
toward O
the O
press O
so O
much O
different O
then O
/? O

Well O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
that O
it O
's O
different O
/. O

Ah O
assuredly O
Carl O
Berstein O
and O
I O
could O
've O
been O
subpoenaed O
ah O
/. O

Did O
you O
worry O
about O
it O
/? O

Sure O
a O
little O
bit O
/. O

but O
you O
know O
what O
happened O
ah O
/. O

There O
were O
so O
many O
specifics O
in O
our O
stories O
ah O
about O
money O
and O
high O
level O
people O
in O
the B-ORG
White I-ORG
house I-ORG
and O
the O
Nixon B-PERSON
campaign O
that O
the O
prosecutors O
could O
subpoena O
them O

get O
them O
to O
talk O

eventually O
they O
did O
/. O

and O
there O
were O
Senate B-ORG
hearings O
when O
ah O
everyone O
testified O
in O
public O
/. O

So O
you O
had O
ah O
very O
very O
different O
circumstances O

So O
you O
know O
I O
agree O
with O
the O
editor O
of O
the B-ORG
New I-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
that O
ah O
this O
is O
not O
a O
perfect O
case O
Judy B-PERSON
Miller I-PERSON
/. O

but O
the O
idea O
of O
the O
government O
and O
special O
prosecutors O
monkeying O
around O
with O
the O
relationship O
that O
reporters O
have O
with O
sources O
ah O
is O
a O
very O
very O
bad O
thing O
/. O

And O
you O
look O
at O
the O
Matt B-PERSON
Cooper I-PERSON
business O
/. O

and O
you O
know O
not O
to O
ah O
spend O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
on O
the O
details O
/. O

Pull O
a O
camera O
back O
/. O

what O
's O
going O
on O
here O
/. O

But O
you O
know O
better O
than O
anyone O
there O
is O
an O
informal O
network O
of O
reporters O
and O
government O
people O
on O
both O
sides O
democrats B-NORP
republicans B-NORP
ah O
liberals O
conservatives O
who O
talk O
to O
reporters O
/. O

and O
I O
may O
talk O
to O
somebody O
/. O

and O
we O
will O
talk O
about O
ninety B-CARDINAL
or O
a O
hundred B-CARDINAL
subjects O
/. O

what O
's O
going O
on O
/. O

what O
do O
you O
hear O
/. O

what O
does O
this O
look O
like O
/. O

where O
is O
that O
going O
/. O

what O
do O
n't O
we O
know O
/. O

And O
then O
something O
comes O
up O
like O
this O
where O
suddenly O
you O
're O
dealing O
with O
a O
covert O
operative O
/. O

Maybe O
you O
did O
n't O
expect O
the O
person O
to O
say O
that O
/. O

but O
you O
've O
given O
your O
word O
, O
you O
've O
given O
your O
pledge O
, O
you O
're O
going O
to O
protect O
this O
person O
/. O

Yes O
but O
when O
we O
learn O
all O
about O
this O
um O
I O
think O
very O
few O
people O
knew O
she O
was O
a O
covert O
operative O
in O
the O
CIA B-ORG
, O
that O
she O
worked O
in O
the O
CIA B-ORG
as O
a O
weapons O
of O
mass O
destruction O
analyst O
/. O

so O
this O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
banter O
that O
goes O
on O
that O
helps O
the O
public O
and O
us O
figure O
out O
uh O
what O
the O
stories O
are O
, O
what O
's O
being O
hidden O
ah O
what O
games O
are O
being O
played O
and O
so O
forth O
/. O

In O
other O
words O
do O
n't O
underestimate O
the O
importance O
of O
these O
background O
or O
off O
the O
record O
conversations O

/. O

exactly O
it O
sounds O
kind O
of O
like O
a O
BS O
session O
/. O

and O
some O
of O
it O
is O
/. O

but O
it O
's O
a O
vital O
lifeline O
to O
the O
underbelly O
of O
government O
/. O

For O
the O
special O
prosecutor O
to O
come O
roaring O
in O
here O
with O
a O
tank O
and O
say O
ah O
you O
know O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
destroy O

ah O
here O
look O
at O
Judy B-PERSON
Miller I-PERSON

she O
never O
wrote O
a O

this O

totally O
ridiculous O

I O
think O
the O

some O
of O
the O
questions O
about O

Scott B-PERSON
I O

I O

this O

ridiculous O
the O

stand O

somehow O
you O

Now O
that O
Rove B-PERSON

Does O
McClellan B-PERSON

all O

the O
old O

earlier O

in O

get O

now O
to O
the O

your O

then O
the O

grapple O
with O
the O
question O
of O
why O

why O
did O

there O

they O

occurring O

what O
outraged O

in O
your O

you O
have O
an O
assumption O

did O

you O
see O
ah O
/- O

Was O

it O
dangerous O

It O
was O
dangerous O
/. O

but O
we O
set O
up O
these O
clandestine O
meetings O

and O
clandestine O

so O
he O
did O
n't O
have O
to O
risk O
his O
career O
/. O

I O
was O
pledged O
to O
tell O
noone O

he O
set O
up O
this O
system O
so O
noone O
would O
know O
that O
we O
were O
talking O

and O
so O
as O
far O
as O
he O
was O
concerned O
yes O
there O
's O
always O
risk O
in O
something O
like O
this O
/. O

but O
he O
had O
taken O
such O
extreme O
care O
that O
there O
was O
minimal O

Let O
's O
take O
a O
look O
at O
who O
most O
people O
think O
of O
when O
they O
think O
of O
Deep B-PERSON
Throat I-PERSON
/. O

they O
think O
of O
Hal B-PERSON
Holbrook I-PERSON
and O
the O
movie O
All B-WORK_OF_ART
The I-WORK_OF_ART
President I-WORK_OF_ART
's I-WORK_OF_ART

Let O
's O
watch O

The O
story O
has O
stalled O
on O
us O
/. O

And O
you O
thought O
I O
'd O
help O

I O
'll O
never O
quote O
you O

I O
would O
n't O
quote O
you O
even O
as O
an O
anonymous O
source O
/. O

You O
'd O
be O
on O
deep O
background O
/. O

But O
of O
course O
in O
your O
book O
with O
Carl B-PERSON
Bernstein I-PERSON
and O
the O
movie O
you O
do O
describe O
a O
Deep B-PERSON
Throat I-PERSON
character O
/. O

Did O
you O
have O
any O
reservations O
about O
that O
/. O

were O
you O
betraying O
that O
agreement O
we O
just O
saw O
/? O

Ah O
no O
I O
really O
was O
n't O
because O
he O
also O
said O
that O
in O
the O
agreement O
was O
no O
disclosure O
but O
ah O
like O
all O
complicated O
relationships O
he O
said O
push O
me O
/. O

I O
've O
been O
a O

and O
you O
do O
n't O
get O
anywhere O
unless O
you O
push O
people O

Hale B-PERSON
/. O

so O
go O
ahead O
/. O

So O
there O
are O
two B-CARDINAL
tracks O
absolute O
confidentiality O
but O
push O
to O
get O
as O
much O
information O
, O
confirm O
as O
much O
new O
information O
as O
possible O

and O
ah O
when O
we O
wrote O
the O
book O
ah O
All B-WORK_OF_ART
the I-WORK_OF_ART
President I-WORK_OF_ART

I O
thought O
I O

how O
do O
you O
leave O
Deep B-PERSON

out O

Ah O
would O
've O
been O
dishonest O

Ah O
we O
concealed O
his O

a O
way O
ah O
that O
it O
remained O
confidential O
for O
more B-DATE

thirty I-DATE

it O
only O
was O
disclosed O

Mark B-PERSON

decided O
to O
disclose O
it O

How O
did O
you O
feel O
when O
more O
recently O
you O
saw O
that O

memo O
that O

had O
signed O

were O
reporting O
half O

truths O

fiction O
and O
we O
need O
to O
find O
the O
leakers O

at O
the O
very O
time O
when O
he O
was O
meeting O
privately O

secretly O
with O
you O
kind O
of O
duplicitous O
/. O

Yes O
it O
's O
very O
duplicitous O
yes O
/. O

but O
it O
's O
also O
very O
careful O
because O
it O
was O
addressing O
a O
specific O
story O
that O
he O
was O
not O
a O

And O
in O
the O
memo O
he O
says O
yes O
clearly O
ah O
they O
have O
access O
to O
FBI B-ORG
or O
justice O
department O
sources O

And O
then O
in O
the O
process O
of O
this O
leak O
investigation O
which O
he O
is O
running O
he O
finds O
the O
leakers O
somebody O
in O
the B-ORG
White I-ORG
House I-ORG
and O
presumably O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
assistant O

he O
alleges O

so O
it O
's O
perfect O

Ah O
and O
he O
sends O
this O
memo O
to O
the O
acting O
FBI B-ORG
director O
Al B-PERSON
Patrick I-PERSON
Grey I-PERSON

and O
then O
they O
send O
a O
message O
to O
the O
Attorney O

ah O
saying O
you O
know O
case O
closed O
we O
found O
out O
who O
did O
it O
/. O

it O
's O
perfect O

Counter-intelligence O
it O

very O
sophisticated O

it O

what O
somebody O
would O

Um O
did O
that O
change O
your O

he O
engaged O

some O

that O

right O

his O
justification O

there O

it O

ask O

at O

most O

going O

was O
taken O
there O

what O

there O
seems O
to O

we O

The O

infliction O

you O

provide O

you O

you O

basically O
that O
under O
certain O

we O
can O

if O
it O
got O

a O

that O

Well O
if O
it O
gets O
to O
a O
filibuster O

I O
think O
that O
's O
a O
very O
close O
call O
tonight B-TIME
whether O
it O
will O
eventually O
get O
there O
or O
not O
and O
the O
Republicans B-NORP
then O
have O
made O
it O
very O
clear O
that O
they O
would O
likely O
invoke O
the O
nuclear O
option O

and O
that O
is O
to O
kill O
the O
filibuster O

to O
kill O
filibusters O
in O
general O

and O
then O
we O
're O
going O

tribal O

We O
may O
not O
get O
there O
Larry B-PERSON

A O
lot O
depends O

Uh O
the O
hearings O
do O
matter O
/. O

People O
have O
to O
look O
more O
closely O
at O
the O
record O

But O
I O
think O
both O
Senators O
are O
I O
think O
exactly O
right O
to O
say O
we O
're O
going O
to O
wait O

hold O
our O
positions O

You O
can O
tell O
by O
the O
way O
the O
activists O
on O
both O
sides O
are O
lining O
up O
that O
this O
is O
going O

a O
Donnybrook B-EVENT

Senator O

does O
that O
mean O

OK O

'm O
not O
sure O
that O

I O
had O
a O

there O
was O
a O

less O

there O

on O

This O
is O
one O
I O
think O
we O

going O
to O

a O
lot O
more O
about O

I O

this O

good O

should O
have O

everyone O

outstanding O

and O
now O
let O
's O
look O
at O
the O
judicial O
philosophy O

I O
think O
he O
probably O
is O
a O
little O
more O
conservative O

He O
's O
probably O
not O
as O
far O
to O
the O
right O
as O
Ruth B-PERSON

to O
the O
left O

uh O

let O
's O
take O
a O
look O

it O
's O
going O
to O
take O
some O
time O

Speaking O
of O
that O
Senator O

you O

all O
things O

equal O
yes O
I O
would O

preferred O

I O

uh O
the O

made O

Sam B-PERSON

I O
do O
agree O
on O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
Larry B-PERSON
/. O

and O
this O
is O
sort O
of O
interesting O
/. O

we O
both O
agree O
that O
the O

state O
their O
judicial O

us O
some O
idea O

how O
he O

these O

I O
think O
the O
days O
of O
the O

Harriet B-PERSON

clearly O
was O
is O
over O

You O

Supreme B-ORG

have O
tremendous O
tremendous O
power O
over O
every O

the O
only O
time O
you O
really O
get O
to O
question O
them O

what O
they O

is O
when O
the O
Senate B-ORG

its O

I O

true O

you O

that O

one O
thing O

does O
worry O

David B-PERSON
Gergen I-PERSON
on O
this O
program O
Bill B-PERSON
Clinton I-PERSON
said O
that O
often O
judges O
disappoint O
the O
presidents O
who O
appoint O
them O
because O
it O
's O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
in O
their O
life O
they O
have O
a O
job O
where O
they O
're O
not O
appealed O
and O
they O
also O
see O
things O
differently O
/. O

Ah O
that O
's O
true O
/. O

I O
do O
not O
think O
that O
's O
the O
case O
in O
this O
instance O
because O
Judge O
Alito B-PERSON
does O
have O
a O
long O
record O
/. O

He O
's O
got O
fifteen B-DATE
years I-DATE
on O
the O
court O
of O
appeals O
/. O

uh O
and O
the O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
we O
do O
know O
about O
him O
is O
that O
he O
's O
had O
some B-CARDINAL
forty I-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
dissents O
on O
that O
court O
almost O
always O
to O
the O
right O
of O
a O
court O
that O
has O
been O
fairly O
liberal O
/. O

Uh O
and O
I O
think O
he O
has O
a O
consistent O
philosophy O
/. O

Larry B-PERSON
hmm O
the O
President O
deserves O
to O
be O
congratulated O
for O
now O
putting O
forward O
someone O
again O
who O
has O
experience O
and O
who O
is O
talented O
/. O

There O
's O
no O
question O
about O
that O
/. O

He O
appears O
to O
be O
quite O
genial O
/. O

I O
'm O
sure O
he O
'll O
do O
pretty O
well O
in O
the O
hearings O
/. O

My O
sense O
is O
that O
this O
is O
ultimately O
going O
to O
come O
down O
to O
the O
question O
is O
the O
senate B-ORG
going O
to O
confirm O
someone O
who O
is O
going O
to O
be O
a O
reliable O
conservative O
and O
probably O
be O
voting O
consistently O
with O
Scalia B-PERSON
and O
Thomas B-PERSON
or O
will O
the O
Democrats B-NORP
be O
able O
to O
block O
that O
/? O

and O
that O
's O
a O
very O
big O
important O
battle O
over O
the O
judicial O
philosophy O
that O
ought O
to O
guide O
the O
court O
/. O

Senator O
Brownbeck B-PERSON
could O
he O
be O
a O
reliable O
conservative O
and O
still O
vote O
to O
uphold O
Roe B-LAW
vs. I-LAW
Wade I-LAW
/? O

Well O
I O
think O
one O
could O
probably O
look O
at O
that O
/. O

but O
I O
think O
that O
's O
an O
unlikely O
way O
to O
consider O
it O
/. O

Roe B-LAW
vs. I-LAW
Wade I-LAW
the O
right O
to O
an O
abortion O
that O
's O
read O
into O
the O
constitution B-LAW
is O
not O
in O
the O
constitution B-LAW
/. O

Uh O
and O
there O
's O
a O
number O
of O
commentators O
from O
the O
left O
and O
right O
that O
agree O
that O
this O
is O
not O
in O
the O
constitution B-LAW
/. O

It O
should O
be O
debated O
/. O

It O
should O
be O
dealt O
with O
by O
legislators O
across O
the O
country O
/. O

So O
I O
think O
he O
could O
read O
it O
that O
way O
/. O

but O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
unlikely O
on O
somebody O
that O
would O
be O
more O
of O
a O
strict O
constructionist O
on O
the O
constitution B-LAW
/. O

But O
he O
could O
uphold O
just O
on O
precedent O

could O
he O
not O
/? O

because O
he O
has O
said O
in O
the O
past O
that O
he O
favors O
precedent O
/. O

I O
think O
almost O
every O
judge O
and O
justice O
favors O
precedent O
the O
role O
of O
starry O
decises O
that O
once O
a O
law O
is O
settled O
it O
's O
settled O

You O
know O
you O
look O
in O
our O
history O

we O
've O
had O
a O
number O
of O
cases O
in O
the B-ORG
supreme I-ORG
court I-ORG

have O
been O
overturned O
by O
later O

you O
expect O

honestly O

we O
could O

Do O
you O

you O

uh O
odd O

the O
silence O
of O
Dick B-PERSON

maybe O
not O
so O
odd O

he O
has O
been O
silent O

I O
find O
it O
uh O
not O

bizarre O

uh O
just O
unfathomable O

uh O
it O

it O

General O
George B-PERSON
Casey I-PERSON
the O

that O
perhaps O
that O

significantly O
reduced O

in O

/. O

is O
that O
an O
optimistic O
assessment O

realistic O

Uh O
I O
think O
it O
's O
very O
realistic O
/. O

The O
Prime O
Minister O
uh O
Jaafari B-PERSON

proposed O
to O
a O
series O
of O
meetings O
of O
the B-ORG
Ministerial I-ORG
Committee I-ORG
for I-ORG
National I-ORG
Security I-ORG
uh O
uh O
uh O
a O
proposal O
whereby O
the O
multinational O
forces O
will O
pull O
out O
from O
some O
of O
the O
provinces O
some O
of O
the O
cities O
where O
the O
security O
is O
okay O

And O
the O
eh O
eh O
Iraqi B-NORP
police O
and O
new O
Iraqi B-NORP
army O
can O
uh O
maintain O
the O
security O
in O
these O
regions O

So O
we O
believe O
that O
the O
multinational O
forces O
are O
ready O
to O
leave O
some O
of O
these O
cities O
some O
of O
the O
provinces O
and O
we O
take O
over O
uh O
the O
responsibility O
of O
the O
security O
of O
these O
uh O
provinces O

large O

so O
what O
is O
a O
realistic O
number O
for O
the B-DATE
spring I-DATE
/. O

a B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
thirty I-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
nine I-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
going O
down O
to O
what O
/? O

Uh O
let O
me O
uh O
give O
you O
some O
uh O
well O
approximate O
figures O
/. O

Of O
course O
these O
figures O
are O
going O
to O
be O
condition O
based O
because O
until O
and O
unless O
the O
right O
conditions O
are O
created O
in O
some O
of O
these O
areas O
the O
multinational O
forces O
will O
not O
leave O
and O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
government O
will O
not O
ask O
them O
to O
leave O
/. O

and O
we O
are O
working O
very O
hard O
to O
create O
these O
conditions O
in O
some O
of O
these O
provinces O
and O
some O
of O
the O
regions O
as O
well O
as O
districts O
/. O

Uh O
when O
the O
conditions O
are O
right O
then O
we O
will O
ask O
the O
multinational O
forces O
to O
leave O
uh O
these O
areas O
/. O

Uh O
I O
would O
have O
a O
guess O
of O
a O
very O
good O
number O
in O
tens B-CARDINAL
of I-CARDINAL
thousands I-CARDINAL
/. O

they O
will O
leave O
in O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
part O
in O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
half I-DATE
of I-DATE
next I-DATE
year I-DATE
/. O

And O
a O
considerable O
number O
uh O
of O
the O
multinational O
forces O
will O
probably O
leave O
Iraq B-GPE
uh O
by O
before O
the B-DATE
end I-DATE
of I-DATE
next I-DATE
year I-DATE
/. O

So O
in O
other O
words O
it O
would O
go O
down O
from O
a B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
thirty I-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
nine I-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
to O
what O
let O
's O
say O
by O
next B-DATE
summer I-DATE
a B-DATE
year I-DATE
from I-DATE
now I-DATE
/. O

what O
would O
be O
a O
realistic O
number O
/? O

I O
would O
n't O
like O
to O
uh O
guess O
a O
figure O
because O
I O
think O
this O
will O
play O
uh O
into O
the O
terrorists O
' O
hands O
as O
well O
as O
it O

unfair O

the O

let O
me O
tell O

by O

uh O

I O

in O
the O
box O

an O

the B-DATE

you O

would O
you O
guess O

how O

can O
we O

uh O
this O
is O
not O

We O

not O

uh O
Milosevic B-PERSON

or O
uh O
uh O
is O

uh O
give O

uh O
his O
rhetorics O

his O
uh O

We O

we O
stick O

the O

we O
have O

five I-CARDINAL

So O
each O
one O
of O
these O
five B-CARDINAL

we O
have O
now O
against O
Saddam B-PERSON

uh O
probably O

uh O

/. O

Well O
eh O
I O
would O

that O

we O

we O

with O
the O

being O

Uh O
but O
there O
's O
always O
a O
tension O
between O
uh O
uh O
staying O
too O
long O
in O
order O
to O
do O
the O
job O
the O
way O
we O
would O
do O
it O
and O
yet O
giving O

an O
opportunity O

try O

And O
our O

are O
on O

they O
're O
able O

make O
those O
judgments O

and O
I O
think O
we O
have O
to O
defer O
significantly O
to O
their O
judgment O
in O
that O

/. O

The O
other O
argument O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
uh O
Senator O
Lieberman B-PERSON
you O
hear O
from O
Senator O
McCain B-PERSON
and O
others O
/. O

the O
US B-GPE
does O
n't O
have O
enough O
troops O
to O
really O
get O
the O
job O
done O
/. O

now O
more O
troops O
really O
should O
be O
added O
to O
the O
mix O
instead O
of O
withdrawing O
them O
/. O

Well O
I O
've O
said O
that O
along O
the O
way O
/. O

I O
mean O
I O
'll O
be O
real O
direct O
about O
it O
/. O

I O
'd O
be O
surprised O
if O
we O
do O
n't O
increase O
the O
number O
of O
American B-NORP
troops O
coalition O
forces O
we O
have O
on O
the O
ground O
between O
now O
and O
the B-DATE
end I-DATE
of I-DATE
this I-DATE
year I-DATE
because O
we O
have O
got O
the O
referendum O
on O
the O
constitution O
coming O
up O
, O
we O
've O
got O
the O
election O
of O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
assembly O
hopefully O
in O
December B-DATE
/. O

Those O
are O
times O
when O
the O
terrorists O
are O
going O
to O
be O
looking O
to O
create O
havoc O
/. O

and O
we O
want O
to O
secure O
the O
country O
as O
well O
as O
we O
did O
in O
January B-DATE
/. O

So O
the O
number O
from O
a B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
thirty I-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
nine I-CARDINAL
may O
go O
up O
in O
the O
short O
term O
before O
it O
eventually O
starts O
to O
go O
down O
/? O

I O
would O
not O
be O

if O
it O
did O
/. O

Look O
this O
leads O
to O
larger O
question O
just O
to O
mention O
briefly O
Wolf B-PERSON
/. O

a O
bunch O
of O
us O
in O
Congress B-ORG
worry O
that O
the O
Army B-ORG
that O
we O
have O
today B-DATE
is O
not O
big O
enough O
and O
we O
're O
stressing O
it O
and O
the O
people O
in O
it O
sending O
people O
back O
to O
Iraq B-GPE
two B-CARDINAL
three B-CARDINAL
times O
/. O

Um O
maybe O
I O
believe O
we O
do O
actually O
need O
uh O
uh O
an O
increase O
in O
the O
end O
strength O
of O
our O
Army B-ORG
so O
our O
commanders O
in O
the O
field O
will O
have O
the O
troops O
they O
need O
as O
the O
facts O
on O
the O

dictate O
/. O

All O
right O
let O

move O
on O
/. O

we O
'll O
get O
to O
that O
subject O
uh O
on O
another O
occasion O
the O
overall O
strength O
of O
the O
US B-GPE
military O
/. O

The O
war O
on O
terror O
Senator O
Kyl B-PERSON
/. O

what O
about O
your O
estimate O
right O
now O
/? O

Is O
the O
US B-GPE
prepared O
for O
similar O
kinds O
of O
strikes O
that O
we O
have O
seen O
in O
recent O
days O
in O
London B-GPE
two B-CARDINAL
series O
uh O
of O
attacks O
there O
as O
well O
as O
Sharm B-GPE
- I-GPE
el I-GPE
- I-GPE
Sheikh I-GPE
in O
Egypt B-GPE
/? O

Uh O
Wolf B-PERSON
that O
's O
a O
question O
that O
has O
several O
different O
answers O
to O
it O
uh O
/. O

The O
first B-ORDINAL
answer O
is O
we O
can O
never O
assure O
uh O
the O
people O
in O
America B-GPE
that O
they O
are O
totally O
protected O
from O
that O
kind O
of O
attack O
/. O

This O
country O
is O
wide O
open O
/. O

we O
enjoy O
our O
freedoms O
/. O

uh O
it O
is O
simply O
impossible O
to O
protect O
every O
single O
shopping O
center O
every O
single O
bus O
every O
single O
train O
or O
uh O
any O
other O
place O
where O
terrorists O
may O
wish O
to O
strike O
/. O

And O
they O
adjust O
their O
tactics O
in O
order O
to O
find O
out O
what O
we O
are O
protecting O
and O
therefore O
what O
they O
want O
to O
uh O
change O
to O
uh O
to O
attack O
a O
softer O
kind O
of O
target O
that O
is O
n't O
protected O
/. O

So O
our O
strategy O
is O
not O
only O
to O
do O
what O
we O
can O
in O
prioritizing O
protection O
of O
the O
homeland O
but O
frankly O
conducting O
offensive O
operations O
against O
the O
terrorists O
/. O

and O
that O
's O
where O
our O
emphasis O
should O
be O
/. O

That O
means O
uh O
a O
very O
good O
intelligence O
capability O
both O
abroad O
and O
in O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
/. O

That O
's O
what O
makes O
the B-LAW
Patriot I-LAW
Act I-LAW
so O
important O
/. O

But O
have O
you O
seen O
Senator O
Kyl B-PERSON
a O
dramatic O
improvement O
in O
intelligence O
gathering O
human O
intelligence O
infiltrating O
these O

over O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
few I-DATE
years I-DATE
on O
the O
part O
of O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE

/? O

It O
's O
improved O
/. O

I O
would O
n't O
call O
it O
a O
dramatic O
improvement O
/. O

But O
it O
certainly O
is O
an O
improvement O
with O
things O
like O
the B-LAW
Patriot I-LAW
Act I-LAW
strengthening O
the O
FISA B-LAW
uh O
enforcement O
allowing O
the O
intelligence O
agencies O
and O
the O
FBI B-ORG
to O
talk O
to O
each O
other O
/. O

We O
have O
gone O
uh O
since O
nine B-EVENT
eleven I-EVENT
without O
an O
attack O
here O
in O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE

We O
've O
broken O
up O

We O

arrested O
people O

We O
've O

literally O
well B-CARDINAL
over I-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL

abroad O
with O
an O
aggressive O
intelligence O
operation O
/. O

So O
um O
the O
the O
war O
on O
terror O
is O
really O
a O
war O
with O
many O
fronts O

The O
first O

foremost O

We O

Democratic B-NORP

Joe B-PERSON
Lieberman I-PERSON
of O
Connecticut B-GPE
and O
Republican B-NORP
Senator O
John B-PERSON
Kyl I-PERSON
of O
Arizona B-GPE
/. O

Senator O
Lieberman B-PERSON
is O
it O
a O
good O
idea O
for O
the O
President O
to O
give O
uh O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
what O
's O
called O
a O
recess O
appointment O
skirting O
the B-ORG
US I-ORG
Senate I-ORG
as O
the O
next O
US B-GPE
ambassador O
to O
the O
UN B-ORG
/? O

Uh O
it O
would O
have O
been O
a O
lot O
better O
idea O
for O
the O
administration O
to O
give O
the O
senators O
on O
the B-ORG
Foreign I-ORG
Relations I-ORG
Committee I-ORG
the O
information O
they O
said O
they O
needed O
and O
I O
think O
they O
were O
right O
uh O
before O
uh O
they O
could O
vote O
on O
the O
uh O
Bolton B-PERSON
nomination O
/. O

Then O
we O
would O
have O
had O
an O
up O
or O
down O
vote O
/. O

and O
my O
guess O
is O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
would O
have O
been O
confirmed O
/. O

and O
he O
would O
have O
gone O
to O
the O
UN B-ORG
uh O
uh O
without O
a O
cloud O
over O
his O
head O
/. O

A O
recess O
appointment O
which O
I O
gather O
is O
coming O
for O
Bolton B-PERSON
will O
send O
him O
there O
with O
a O
cloud O
over O
his O
head O
/. O

But O
look O
he O
will O
be O
our O
UN B-ORG
ambassador O
/. O

He O
'll O
have O
the O
obvious O
uh O
authority O
of O
the O
President O
of O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
/. O

And O
I O
think O
we O
've O
got O
to O
hope O
he O
does O
the O
best O
job O
he O
can O
in O
a O
tough O
time O
important O
time O
up O
there O
/. O

he O
would O
be O
Senator O
Kyl B-PERSON
the O
first B-ORDINAL
United B-GPE
States I-GPE
ambassador O
to O
the B-ORG
United I-ORG
Nations I-ORG
who O
did O
not O
get O
confirmation O
from O
the B-ORG
United I-ORG

Senate I-ORG
/. O

Is O
that O
a O
problem O
/? O

Uh O
it O
would O
have O
been O
better O
had O
he O
been O
confirmed O
/. O

but O
uh O
under O
the O
circumstances O
everybody O
at O
the O
UN B-ORG
will O
know O
that O
he O
's O
the O
President O
's O
man O
/. O

Uh O
yeah O
he O
's O
a O
tough O
guy O
/. O

but O
I O
think O
they O
appreciate O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
President O
uh O
felt O
at O
this O
time O
in O
the O
UN B-ORG
's O
history O
when O
it O
could O
use O
a O
little O
tough O
love O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
is O
the O
kind O
of O
guy O
to O
do O
the O
job O
that O
the O
President O
wants O
done O
there O
/. O

Senator O
Lieberman B-PERSON
uh O
based O
on O
what O
you O
know O
right O
now O
are O
you O
inclined O
to O
vote O
to O
uh O
confirm O
John B-PERSON
Roberts I-PERSON
as O
the O
next O
US B-GPE
associate O
justice O
of O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
/? O

Too O
early O
to O
say O
Wolf B-PERSON
/. O

I O
think O
this O
is O
a O
nominee O
for O
whom O
the O
hearings O
before O
the B-ORG
Judiciary I-ORG
Committee I-ORG
are O
going O
to O
be O
real O
important O
/. O

but O
I O
'd O
say O
this O
/. O

so O
far O
so O
good O
/. O

You O
know O
I O
was O
a O
member O
of O
the O
group O
of O
fourteen B-CARDINAL
uh O
/. O

we O
got O
together O
to O
stop O
the O
so O
called O
nuclear O
option O
that O
Senator O
Frist B-PERSON
was O
talking O
about O
/. O

But O
I O
think O
in O
a O
larger O
sense O
we O
were O
saying O
to O
the O
President O
Mr. O
President O
uh O
I O
hope O
you O
'll O
send O
us O
someone O
who O
does O

blow O

up O

n't O
create O
his O
own O
or O
her O
own O
sort O
of O
nuclear O
option O
/. O

uh O
and O
I O
think O
that O
the O
President O
has O
done O
that O
/. O

Some O
may O
vote O
against O
/. O

Uh O
but O
this O
is O
a O
clearly O
very O
very O
accomplished O
nominee O
/. O

And O
we O
have O
to O
know O
more O
about O
how O
he O
thinks O
on O
issues O
/. O

There O
are O
some O
conservatives O
uh O
Senator O
Kyl B-PERSON
as O
you O
know O
who O
are O
a O
little O
concerned O
that O
he O
does O
n't O
have O
the O
paper O
trail O
on O
abortion O
rights O
issues O
on O
other O
issues O
that O
would O
make O
him O
more O
acceptable O

to O
you O
/. O

Who O
are O
you O
very O
pleased O
or O
moderately O
pleased O
with O
John B-PERSON
Roberts I-PERSON

I O
think O
he O
's O
an O
excellent O
nominee O

Uh O
frankly O
if O
there O
are O
people O
on O
the O
left O
or O
the O
right O
that O
are O
not O
sure O
how O
he O
's O
going O
to O
rule O
on O
a O
case O
that O
's O
fine O
by O
me O
/. O

He O
's O
a O
judge O

He O
's O
supposed O
to O
take O
the O
facts O
when O
they O
're O
given O
to O
him O
apply O
the O
law O
and O
make O
a O
decision O

And O
I O
think O
he O
's O
the O
kind O
of O
person O
who O
based O
on O
his O
previous O
experience O
uh O
including O
his O
most O
recent O
experience O
as O
a O
judge O
on O
the O
court O
of O
appeals O
has O
demonstrated O
that O
he O
'll O
do O
exactly O
that O

excellent O

Uh O
the O
Senate B-ORG
majority O
leader O
Bill B-PERSON
Frist I-PERSON
this B-DATE
week I-DATE
Senator O
Kyl B-PERSON
came O
out O
in O
favor O
of O
an O
expanded O
version O
of O
stem O
cell O
research O
beyond O
what O
the O

would O
like O
breaking O

the O

Are O
you O
influenced O
by O
what O
Senator O
Frist B-PERSON
says O
/? O

Are O
you O
now O
about O
to O
go O
along O
with O
him O
/? O

Well O
I O
'm O
certainly O
influenced O
by O
what O
Senator O
Frist B-PERSON
says O
because O
he O
's O
a O
respected O
physician O
/. O

He O
knows O
the O
subject O
very O
well O
/. O

Uh O
in O
this O
particular O
case O
I O
agree O
with O
his O
previous O
position O
and O
that O
of O
the O
President O
/. O

I O
'll O
certainly O
listen O
to O
all O
of O
the O
debate O
and O
anything O
that O
Senator O
Frist B-PERSON
Dr. O
Frist B-PERSON
has O
to O
say O
/. O

but O
my O
own O
views O
reflect O
uh O
those O
of O
the O
President O
on O
this O
matter O
/. O
/. O

So O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
an O
open O
mind O
/. O

is O
that O
what O
you O
're O
saying O
/? O

No O
/. O
you O
know O
uh O
my O
father O
always O
used O
to O
say O
always O
have O
an O
open O
mind O
/. O

but O
remember O
there O
's O
a O
difference O
between O
an O
open O
mind O
and O
a O
hole O
in O
the O
head O
/. O

So O
I O
'll O
apply O
my O
own O
judgment O
and O
be O
open O
- O
minded O
/. O

but O
again O
I O
have O
basic O
principles O
that O
I O
apply O
to O
decisions O
as O
well O
/. O

Senator O
Lieberman B-PERSON
uh O
what O
about O
you O
/? O

Uh O
I O
've O
been O
for O
more O
funding O
for O
stem O
cell O
research O
/. O

it O
's O
one O
of O
the O
most O
exciting O
uh O
medical O
developments O
of O
our O
age O
/. O

it O
could O
bring O
better O
treatments O
even O
cures O
for O
diseases O
that O
cause O
a O
lot O
of O
pain O
and O
death O
to O
millions O
of O
people O
/. O

I O
thought O
Bill O
Frist B-PERSON
's O
uh O
statement O
this B-DATE
week I-DATE
took O
a O
lot O
of O
guts O
/. O

he O
changed O
a O
position O
he O
had O
/. O

but O
that O
's O
human O
nature O
/. O

and O
you O
've O
got O
the O
confidence O
to O
do O
that O
/. O

Very O
significant O
/. O

I O
believe O
now O
that O
the O
Senate B-ORG
will O
pass O
the O
legislation O
that O
we O
're O
talking O
about O
which O
is O
more O
funding O
for O
stem O
cell O
research O
on O
frozen O
embryos O
that O
are O
extra O
basically O
have O
been O
set O
aside O
for O
in O

fertilization O
/. O

I O
think O
we O
're O
going O
to O
pass O
it O
by O
more O
than O
the B-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL
thirds I-CARDINAL
required O
to O
overturn O
an O
expected O
presidential O
veto O
/. O

and O
it O
's O
really O
the O
right O
thing O
to O
do O
/. O

But O
that O
also O
has O
to O
pass O
in O
the B-ORG
House I-ORG
of I-ORG

where O
you O
may O
not O
have O
the O
votes O
/. O

You O
're O
absolutely O
right O
/. O

so O
unfortunately O
the O
outcome O
is O
in O
doubt O
/. O

a O
lot O

lives O
are O
on O
the O
line O

I O
guess O
the O
key O
question O
on O

mind O
right O
now O
are O
those O
astronauts O
uh O
in O
danger O
upon O
their O
return O
to O
Earth B-LOC
/? O

good O
morning B-TIME
it O
's O
good O
to O
be O
here O
/. O

and O
the O
answer O
to O
that O
is O
of O
course O
they O
are O
/. O

Returning O

twenty B-QUANTITY

to O
a O
complete O
dead O
stop O
at O
a O
runway O
in O
Florida B-GPE
that O
is O
a O
hazardous O
operation O
/. O

The O
way O
we O
minimize O
the O
risk O
and O
maximize O
the O
safety O
for O
the O
crew O
is O
by O
thorough O
engineering O
analysis O
and O
review O
of O
every O
potential O
hazard O
/. O

And O
we O
are O
in O
the O
process O
of O
doing O
that O
/. O

And O
we O
believe O
that O
the O
crew O
will O
be O
as O
safe O
as O
normal O
coming O
back O
uh O
when O
we O
get O
ready O
to O
a B-DATE
week I-DATE
from I-DATE
today I-DATE
/. O

Are O
they O
in O
greater O
danger O
because O
of O
that O
miscalculation O
of O
that O
small O
piece O
of O
foam O
emerging O
upon O
lift O
- O
off O
/? O

Well O
the O
short O
answer O
is O
no O
/. O

That O
uh O
piece O
of O
foam O
missed O
the O
vehicle O
/. O

and O
any O
damage O
that O
might O
have O
occurred O
is O
uh O
hypothetical O
/. O

That O
is O
the O
problem O
that O
we O
have O
to O
solve O
for O
the O
next O
flight O
/. O

For O
this O
flight O
we O
understand O
what O
happened O
in O
terms O
of O
damage O
to O
the O
orbiter O
/. O

And O
we O
believe O
it O
will O
be O
safe O
to O
re-enter O
/. O

Is O
that O
a B-PERCENT
hundred I-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
sure O
now O
that O
they O
will O
return O
a B-DATE
week I-DATE
from I-DATE
tomorrow I-DATE
uh O
aboard O
the O
Discovery B-PRODUCT
shuttle O
as O
opposed O
to O
some O
emergency O
procedure O
that O
might O
be O
required O
to O
bring O
them O
back O
/? O

We O
have O
maintained O
the O
emergency O
uh O
rescue O
vehicle O
on O
stand O
by O
/. O

and O
we O
will O
continue O
to O
do O
that O
for O
a O
couple O
more O
days O
until O
we O
have O
completed O
all O
our O
entry O
analysis O

At O
that O
time O
we O
'll O
release O
the O
uh O
Atlantis B-PRODUCT

its O

processing O

its O

So O
as O
of O
right O
now O
we O
have O
not O
taken O
a O
rescue O
off O
the O

we O
think O
the O

Listen O

the O

letter O

hard O

the O

We O
looked O
at O
it O
with O
uh O

We O
looked O
at O
it O

a O

Uh O
we O
did O
not O
see O
anything O

So O
right O
now O
we O
are O
scratching O
our O
heads O
trying O
to O
understand O
what O
mechanism O
caused O
this O
piece O
of O

come O
off O

It O
must O
be O
different O
than O
the O
uh O
mechanism O

we O
had O
identified O
earlier O

had O
done O
work O
on O
other O
areas O
to O
prevent O
uh O
foam O

from O
occurring O

So O
the O
engineers O
are O
going O
to O
have O
to O
take O
another O
look O
at O
this O

Uh O
we O
thought O
we O
understood O
what O
we O

clearly O
we O
were O

more O

Is O
that O
true O

Well O
the O
shuttle O
was O
designed O
for O
a B-CARDINAL

flights O
in O
ten B-DATE
years I-DATE

And O
uh O
the O
Discovery B-PRODUCT

almost B-DATE
twenty I-DATE

thirty B-CARDINAL

So O
in O

they O

we O

we O

We O
're O
almost O

out O

a O

question O

When O
do O
you O
believe O
if O
it O
happens O
the O
next O

will O
take O
off O

Well O
we O

putting O
together O

go O
off O

do O
an O
investigation O
uh O

come O
up O
with O
the O
solution O

this O
problem O

and O
I O
am O
very O
hopeful O
that O
the O

short O

Uh O
it O
's O
our O
intention O

fix O
it O

But O
the O
point O
of O
the O
matter O
is O
we O
must O
understand O
what O
this O
problem O
was O
caused O
by O
this O
pal O
ramp O
foam O

provide O
a O

it O
