No O
one O
who O
followed O

his O
assistants O
' O
trial O
session O
for O
the O
Anfal B-PERSON
crimes O
of O
12/06/2006 O
can O
deny O
the O
role O
of O
the O
testimony O
that O
Dr. O
Faek B-PERSON
Mohammed I-PERSON
Kolbi I-PERSON
gave O
. O

As O
an O
eyewitness O
, O
he O
recounted O
real O
events O
as O
a O
doctor O
who O
practiced O
his O
humanitarian O
and O
national O
role O
in O
treating O
victims O
of O
chemical O
weapons O
, O
especially O
as O
he O
performed O
his O
role O
well O
in O
listing O
details O
. O

But O
as O
a O
chairman O
of O
a O
political O
party O
in O
Kurdistan B-GPE
who O
has O
a O
history O
of O
resistance O
in O
the O
Kurdish B-NORP
liberation O
movement O
, O
he O
should O
have O
called O
things O
by O
their O
real O
names O
and O
avoided O
the O
barren O
justification O
that O
previous O
plaintiffs O
and O
witnesses O
used O
when O
they O
mentioned O
the O
role O
of O
merchants O
of O
war O
, O
agents O
of O
the O
former O
regime O
who O
are O
called O
the O
leaders O
of O
the O
Kurdish B-NORP
clans O
, O
or O
consultants O
as O
the O
former O
dictator O
authority O
called O
them O
. O

The O
least O
that O
could O
be O
said O
about O
those O
hireling O
criminals O
is O
that O
they O
are O
despicable O
mercenaries O
, O
for O
the O
crimes O
they O
committed O
that O
can O
not O
be O
justified O
under O
any O
circumstance O
. O

The O
scale O
of O
their O
crimes O
is O
not O
less O
than O
the O
crimes O
of O
the O
tyrant O
and O
his O
bloodthirsty O
cousin O
, O
Chemical B-PERSON
Ali I-PERSON
. O

The O
right O
place O
for O
those O
mercenaries O
is O
beside O
their O
humiliated O
master O
in O
the O
defendant O
's O
cage O
. O

We O
find O
that O
most O
of O
the O
witnesses O
, O
especially O
with O
the O
unqualified O
translators O
that O
the O
court O
has O
appointed O
, O
who O
many O
times O
distorted O
the O
witnesses O
' O
testimonies O
in O
favor O
of O
those O
mercenaries O
as O
when O
they O
called O
them O
consultants O
of O
the O
national O
defense O
forces O
according O
to O
what O
the O
regime O
calls O
them O
. O

Naming O
those O
criminals O
and O
their O
followers O
as O
national O
defense O
regiments O
can O
not O
be O
justified O
. O

This O
is O
enough O
to O
annul O
the O
accusations O
against O
the O
plaintiffs O
in O
the O
Anfal B-PERSON
case O
, O
a O
mass O
annihilation O
. O

How O
could O
troops O
, O
whose O
duty O
was O
to O
defend O
the O
nation O
, O
burn O
the O
nation O
, O
annihilate O
its O
people O
with O
chemical O
weapons O
, O
and O
bury O
them O
alive O
in O
mass O
graves O
? O

Without O
an O
appointment O
, O
and O
without O
a O
meeting O
or O
prior O
knowledge O
, O
I O
found O
one O
of O
my O
writings O
published O
in O
a O
newspapers O
called O
Laila B-ORG
. O

After O
skimming O
through O
this O
magazine O
, O
I O
realized O
that O
its O
editor O
- O
in O
- O
chief O
is O
a O
Lebanese B-NORP
Christian B-NORP
brother O
. O

I O
browsed O
through O
its O
lines O
and O
decided O
to O
continue O
publishing O
all O
my O
writings O
on O
its O
pages O
. O

Eventually O
, O
I O
was O
selected O
as O
one O
of O
its O
permanent O
writers O
. O

I O
consider O
being O
among O
those O
brethren O
an O
honor O
for O
me O
or O
for O
any O
other O
writer O
. O

I O
frankly O
tell O
you O
that O
it O
took O
over O
my O
heart O
and O
came O
to O
rest O
in O
it O
. O

It O
is O
the O
most O
cherished O
newspaper O
among O
the O
many O
newspapers O
in O
which O
I O
publish O
. O

But O
the O
obvious O
question O
is O
: O
why O
am O
I O
writing O
this O
article O
now O
? O

What O
is O
the O
occasion O
? O

Since O
last O
Ramadan B-DATE
, O
I O
have O
been O
receiving O
many O
e-mails O
asking O
why O
I O
publish O
in O
this O
magazine O
and O
inquiring O
why O
I O
insist O
on O
publishing O
in O
this O
newspaper O
, O
and O
the O
secret O
behind O
it O
. O

The O
letters O
intensified O
and O
became O
varied O
in O
how O
they O
flung O
sermons O
and O
religious O
images O
that O
have O
recently O
emerged O
, O
which O
are O
an O
organized O
campaign O
aimed O
at O
social O
unification O
and O
ripping O
apart O
the O
physical O
Arab B-NORP
structure O
of O
Muslims B-NORP
and O
Christians B-NORP
; O
where O
we O
live O
together O
in O
unity O
and O
solidarity O
in O
the O
Arab B-NORP
World O
and O
abroad O
. O

Neither O
Arab B-NORP
countries O
nor O
our O
relationship O
with O
one O
another O
has O
made O
distinctions O
among O
the O
one O
people O
, O
and O
the O
sectarian O
, O
religious O
fanaticism O
has O
not O
attacked O
us O
. O

We O
united O
and O
never O
inquired O
: O
are O
you O
a O
Christian B-NORP
or O
a O
Muslim B-NORP
? O

That O
is O
what O
has O
materialized O
in O
effect O
in O
Lebanon B-GPE
, O
Palestine B-GPE
, O
Egypt B-GPE
, O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
Arab B-NORP
countries O
. O

As O
for O
the O
owners O
of O
those O
poisoned O
pens O
and O
cloned O
minds O
who O
are O
trying O
to O
destroy O
our O
social O
unity O
, O
it O
is O
the O
result O
of O
colonization O
and O
globalization O
spreading O
its O
malignant O
poisons O
to O
continue O
this O
conspiracy O
against O
everything O
that O
is O
Arabic B-NORP

Our O

would O

how O

To O
them O
we O
say O
that O
the O
people O
of O
Palestine B-GPE
were O
living O
safely O
and O
securely O
in O
their O
country O
, O
which O
was O
a O
Syrian B-NORP
province O
under O
Ottoman B-NORP
Sultanate O
rule O
.. O

Britain B-GPE
came O

and O
with O
it O
France B-GPE
, O
and O
engaged O
in O
a O
war O
with O
the O
Ottoman B-NORP
Sultanate O
.. O
to O
end O
the O

his O

in O
the B-LOC
National I-LOC

the O

with O

And O
during O

the O
English B-NORP
Foreign O

Mr. B-PERSON

gave O
his O
promise O
to O
create O
a O
national O
homeland O
for O
the O
Jews B-NORP
in O
Palestine B-GPE
. O

For O
years O
, O
we O
have O
all O
followed O
this O
feverish O
interest O
of O
the O
Western B-NORP
powers O
, O
led O
by O
America B-GPE
, O
in O
Sudan B-GPE
and O
the O
events O
and O
conflicts O
that O
are O
happening O
there O
. O

We O
have O
followed O
this O
international O
intervention O
to O
reach O
a O
solution O
to O
the O
problem O
of O
the O
south O
and O
the O
war O
that O
has O
been O
going O
on O
there O
for O
more O
than O
20 B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

This O
intervention O
resulted O
in O
a O
peace O
agreement O
with O
unfair O
conditions O
that O
are O
considered O
a O
prelude O
to O
the O
separation O
of O
the O
south O
from O
the O
north O
and O
the O
creation O
of O
a O
Christian B-NORP
state O
in O
the O
south O
. O

This O
feverish O
race O
did O
not O
quiet O
down O
after O
the O
signing O
of O
the O
agreement O
and O
its O
entering O
into O
the O
implementation O
phase O
, O
but O
it O
looked O
for O
another O
front O
to O
exploit O
in O
order O
to O
achieve O
its O
objectives O
. O

That O
front O
was O
the O
-LRB- O
Darfur B-GPE
-RRB- O
region O
. O

America B-GPE
and O
the O
major O
powers O
accused O
what O
they O
call O
-LRB- O
the B-ORG
Janjaweed I-ORG
Militias I-ORG
-RRB- O
of O
Arab B-NORP
origin O
of O
carrying O
out O
mass O
killings O
with O
the O
support O
of O
the O
Sudanese B-NORP
government O
, O
and O
launching O
a O
genocidal O
ethnic O
war O
against O
other O
tribes O
of O
African B-NORP
origin O
. O

Even O
though O
they O
are O
all O
Muslims B-NORP
and O
the O
conflicts O
between O
the O
tribes O
in O
the O
-LRB- O
Darfur B-GPE
-RRB- O
region O
are O
old O
, O
all O
because O
of O
the O
encroachments O
made O
by O
shepherds O
on O
the O
fields O
of O
farmers O
to O
feed O
their O
flocks O
, O
the O
conflicts O
are O
settled O
by O
traditional O
councils O
whose O
decisions O
are O
binding O
on O
both O
sides O
. O

In O
spite O
of O
all O
this O
, O
the O
imperialist O
forces O
, O
led O
by O
America B-GPE
, O
have O
invented O
an O
ethnic O
war O
and O
incidents O
of O
rape O
committed O
by O
Muslims B-NORP
against O
other O
Muslims B-NORP
and O
Muslim B-NORP
women O
. O

These O
countries O
have O
taken O
it O
upon O
themselves O
to O
defend O
the O
rights O
of O
those O
oppressed O
Muslims B-NORP
against O
their O
oppressor O
brethren O
who O
are O
also O
Muslims B-NORP
. O

If O
we O
know O
with O
certainty O
that O
America B-GPE
and O
Europe B-GPE
unceasingly O
wage O
war O
on O
Muslims B-NORP
and O
exterminate O
them O
every O
place O
on O
earth O
their O
hands O
can O
reach O
, O
what O
interest O
do O
they O
have O
in O
the O
case O
of O
-LRB- O
Darfur B-GPE
, O
-RRB- O
coming O
to O
intervene O
in O
defense O
of O
a O
group O
of O
Muslims B-NORP
?!! O

This O
is O
a O
puzzle O
. O

There O
was O
a O
young O
Saudi B-NORP
man O
who O
left O
for O
America B-GPE
to O
study O
English B-NORP
and O
reside O
there O
, O
in O
search O
of O
a O
homeland O
that O
would O
appreciate O
his O
talent O
. O

This O
young O
man O
learned O
the O
language O
, O
I O
will O
call O
him O
by O
the O
name O
-LRB- O
Khaled B-PERSON
-RRB- O
, O
but O
he O
is O
no O
Khaled B-PERSON
. O

Khaled B-PERSON
settled O
down O
in O
America B-GPE
for O
ten O
years O
without O
coming O
back O
to O
his O
town O
in O
Saudi B-GPE
Arabia I-GPE
. O

He O
got O
busy O
with O
work O
and O
lived O
in O
American B-NORP
society O
, O
until O
a O
missile O
company O
in O
one O
of O
the O
American B-NORP
states O
realized O
that O
this O
young O
man O
had O
a O
talent O
in O
atomic O
science O
. O

He O
was O
appointed O
manager O
of O
a O
missile O
lathe O
company O
in O
America B-GPE
; O
no O
missile O
would O
even O
leave O
this O
company O
without O
this O
young O
Saudi B-NORP
man O
's O
signature O
. O

One O
day O
, O
after O
ten O
years O
of O
his O
stay O
in O
America B-GPE
, O
coincidentally O
, O
one O
of O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
princes O
came O
to O
the O
state O
where O
this O
young O
man O
resided O
, O
and O
this O
prince O
asked O
for O
a O
translator O
for O
the O
doctors O
. O

They O
told O
him O
that O
there O
was O
a O
Saudi B-NORP
young O
man O
in O
the O
same O
state O
who O
had O
mastered O
the O
English B-NORP
language O
, O
so O
he O
told O
them O
to O
bring O
him O
to O
translate O
for O
me O
what O
the O
doctors O
say O
. O

This O
young O
man O
came O
and O
spent O
a O
month O
with O
the O
prince O
, O
translating O
for O
him O
while O
he O
stayed O
in O
the O
hospital O
. O

One O
month O
after O
the O
prince O
's O
arrival O
in O
America B-GPE
, O
he O
wrote O
a O
poem O
of O
longing O
for O
his O
people O
and O
homeland O
. O

This O
young O
man O
thought O
to O
himself O
and O
said O
, O
I O
have O
been O
here O
in O
America B-GPE
for O
ten O
years O
, O
and O
I O
did O
not O
send O
one O
letter O
to O
my O
family O
. O

I O
do O
not O
know O
anything O
about O
them O
. O

This O
prince O
after O
only O
one O
month O
sent O
a O
poem O
of O
longing O
to O
his O
family O
. O

So O
this O
young O
man O
, O
Khaled B-PERSON
, O
decided O
to O
return O
back O
to O
his O
family O
and O
homeland O
. O

When O
the O
company O
learned O
that O
this O
young O
man O
had O
decided O
to O
return O
to O
his O
homeland O
, O
unfortunately O
America B-GPE
fights O
every O
Arab B-NORP
talented O
mind O
, O
it O
made O
him O
a O
victim O
of O
heroin O
and O
alcohol O
until O
he O
went O
half O
crazy O
. O

After O
that O
, O
they O
allowed O
him O
to O
return O
to O
his O
homeland O
. O

I O
was O
not O
expecting O
what O
happened O
on O
a O
live O
program O
on O
the B-ORG
Nur I-ORG
Dubai I-ORG
channel I-ORG
when O
the O
hosts O
hung O
up O
on O
a O
caller O
who O
was O
complaining O
about O
houses O
being O
flooded O
in O
Al B-LOC
- I-LOC
Rashidiya I-LOC
in O
Dubai B-GPE
. O

The O
reason O
for O
the O
flooding O
was O
n't O
the O
rain O
that O
fell O
in O
the O
Emirates B-GPE
but O
rather O
because O
of O
water O
leaking O
out O
of O
the O
drains O
, O
as O
well O
as O
Dubai B-GPE
municipality O
's O
emergency O
services O
not O
responding O
to O
calls O
. O

Unfortunately O
the O
program O
's O
hosts O
did O
n't O
give O
this O
lady O
a O
chance O
to O
finish O
what O
she O
was O
saying O
with O
" B-PERSON
Bu I-PERSON
Omar I-PERSON
" I-PERSON
attempting O
to O
justify O
the O
municipality O
's O
position O
and O
defend O
them O
in O
a O
bizarre O
way O
that O
I O
would O
n't O
have O
expected O
from O
" B-PERSON
Bu I-PERSON
Omar I-PERSON
" I-PERSON
for O
whom O
I O
have O
immense O
respect O
and O
admiration O
because O
of O
his O
wonderful O
way O
of O
speaking O
. O

My O
main O
criticism O
is O
not O
about O
hanging O
up O
on O
the O
caller O
because O
the O
program O
's O
hosts O
know O
more O
about O
the O
circumstances O
and O
" O
warding O
off O
evil O
takes O
priority O
over O
seeking O
interest O
" O
. O

The O
criticism O
of O
" B-PERSON
Bu I-PERSON
Omar I-PERSON
" I-PERSON
is O
that O
he O
allowed O
the O
Emirates B-GPE
and O
other O
areas O
to O
be O
criticized O
but O
not O
Dubai B-GPE
, O
even O
though O
the O
breakdown O
that O
happened O
in O
other O
areas O
because O
of O
the O
rain O
, O
also O
happened O
in O
Dubai B-GPE
, O
though O
to O
a O
lesser O
extent O
. O

I O
hope O
" B-PERSON
Bu I-PERSON
Omar I-PERSON
" I-PERSON
does O
not O
take O
this O
approach O
again O
to O
avoid O
losing O
people O
's O
faith O
in O
the O
program O
, O
which O
is O
seen O
as O
a O
refuge O
and O
breathing O
space O
for O
many O
people O
. O

I O
ask O
God B-PERSON
to O
grant O
success O
to O
the O
program O
's O
hosts O
in O
fulfilling O
their O
mission O
. O

For O
more O
than O
10 B-CARDINAL
years O
, O
I O
have O
been O
going O
to O
happy O
Yemen B-GPE
on O
most O
of O
my O
vacations O
, O
for O
what O
you O
find O
of O
cheap O
prices O
, O
beauty O
, O
conservatism O
, O
generosity O
, O
and O
the O
undamaged O
nature O
of O
its O
people O
there O
, O
though O
the O
services O
are O
still O
poor O
, O
but O
they O
have O
started O
to O
improve O
. O

I O
go O
to O
Yemen B-GPE
more O
than O
once O
a O
year O
. O

In O
order O
for O
the O
brothers O
to O
benefit O
religiously O
from O
their O
visits O
to O
Yemen B-GPE
, O
I O
invite O
them O
to O
visit O
the O
Quranic B-NORP
houses O
which O
are O
spread O
through O
all O
the O
provinces O
and O
include O
thousands O
of O
students O
spending O
their O
time O
with O
the B-WORK_OF_ART
Holy I-WORK_OF_ART
Quran I-WORK_OF_ART
. O

These O
houses O
are O
spreading O
and O
their O
students O
increase O
in O
number O
during O
summertime B-DATE
. O

There O
are O
things O
there O
that O
please O
the O
mind O
and O
open O
the O
heart O
. O

Also O
, O
visiting O
the O
charity O
associations O
that O
are O
active O
in O
the O
programs O
they O
provide O
, O
like O
the B-ORG
Islah I-ORG
Association I-ORG
, O
Tiba B-ORG
Charity I-ORG
Foundation I-ORG
, O
and O
others O
. O

What O
also O
distinguishes O
Yemen B-GPE
is O
the O
diversity O
of O
cultures O
. O

In O
every O
district O
, O
you O
find O
something O
that O
distinguishes O
it O
from O
the O
other O
. O

It O
has O
enough O
historic O
places O
and O
ancient O
civilizations O
to O
encourage O
visits O
to O
it O
, O
like O
the B-LOC
Throne I-LOC
of I-LOC
Bilqees I-LOC
and O
the B-LOC
Marib I-LOC
Dam I-LOC
. O

It O
has O
coastal O
areas O
and O
beaches O
that O
are O
not O
found O
elsewhere O
, O
like O
the B-LOC
beaches I-LOC
of I-LOC
Al I-LOC
Makla I-LOC
, I-LOC
Aden I-LOC
and I-LOC
Al I-LOC
Khokha I-LOC
. O

It O
is O
worth O
visiting O
and O
getting O
to O
know O
all O
of O
these O
places O
. O

And O
visiting O
Yemen B-GPE
does O
not O
cost O
you O
much O
. O

There O
are O
some O
bad O
habits O
that O
a O
great O
majority O
of O
people O
have O
. O

They O
think O
there O
is O
no O
harm O
in O
them O
, O
and O
that O
they O
are O
even O
good O
habits O
, O
though O
they O
might O
put O
our O
health O
on O
the O
edge O
. O

We O
can O
mention O
some O
of O
them O
in O
brief O
below O
: O

drinking O
tea O
after O
eating O
. O

It O
is O
known O
that O
tea O
contains O
tannin O
, O
a O
substance O
that O
inhibits O
the O
absorption O
of O
iron O
by O
the O
intestines O
, O
which O
deprives O
the O
body O
of O
it O
. O

Consequently O
, O
the O
body O
could O
become O
anemic O
. O

There O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
tea O
is O
beneficial O
at O
more O
than O
one O
level O
, O
but O
we O
should O
be O
cautious O
of O
excessive O
drinking O
of O
it O
, O
as O
its O
detriments O
could O
outweigh O
its O
benefits O

It O
is O
better O
to O
drink O
tea O
outside O
of O
meal O
times O
. O

As O
for O
the O
quantity O
, O
it O
ranges O
from O
two O
to B-CARDINAL
three I-CARDINAL
cups O
per O
day O
, O
no O
more O
. O

Whoever O
drinks O
more O
, O
has O
only O
himself O
to O
blame O
. O

Using O
frying O
oil O
over O
and O
over O
. O

Frying O
oil O
repeatedly O
makes O
it O
oxidize O
and O
, O
as O
a O
result O
it O
releases O
compounds O
that O
are O
harmful O
to O
the O
body O
, O
especially O
to O
the O
arteries O
. O

Moreover O
, O
research O
has O
shown O
that O
these O
compounds O
play O
a O
role O
in O
causing O
cancer O
. O

The O
best O
thing O
that O
can O
be O
done O
is O
to O
throw O
away O
oil O
after O
frying O
in O
it O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

Some O
try O
to O
add O
new O
oil O
to O
old O
oil O
. O

This O
is O
like O
the O
saying O
" O
pouring O
oil O
on O
fire O
. O
" O

Adding O
salt O
to O
meat O
before O
it O
is O
grilled O
. O

This O
habit O
is O
very O
bad O
, O
because O
salt O
absorbs O
water O
from O
the O
meat O
, O
and O
this O
drains O
the O
minerals O
and O
vitamins O
from O
it O
, O
particularly O
iron O
. O

Meat O
should O
first O
be O
grilled O
and O
then O
the O
salt O
added O
to O
it O
. O

New O
specializations O
for O
female O
students O
. O

There O
are O
calls O
for O
more O
areas O
of O
specialization O
to O
be O
opened O
up O
for O
females O
students O
. O

What O
are O
the O
fields O
you O
think O
need O
to O
be O
opened O
up O
to O
them O
rapidly O
? O

Female O
students O
need O
to O
specialize O
in O
the O
fields O
of O
education O
technology O
in O
all O
its O
branches O
. O

This O
is O
not O
empty O
talk O

it O
is O

on O
a O

and O
other O
areas O

by O
the O

. O

This O
is O
what O
market O
requirement O
studies O
have O
shown O
, O
conducted O
in O
order O
to O
delineate O
new O
specializations O
, O
whether O

Do O
you O
back O
a O
single O
academic O
curriculum O
for O
male O
and O
female O
students O
? O

Or O
do O
you O
believe O
each O
side O
has O
their O
specific O
talents O
? O

I O
'm O
for O
a O
single O
curriculum O
, O
apart O
from O
certain O
subjects O
such O
as O
home O

. O

As O
for O
mathematics O
, O
and O
according O
to O
the O
latest O
child O
development O
and O
growth O
studies O
, O
and O
the O
difference O
between O
females O
and O
males O
, O
at O
the O
early O
stages O
, O
it O
's O
preferable O
for O
information O
to O
be O
presented O
differently O
, O
but O
to O
be O
combined O
later O
on O
. O

But O
I O
also O
back O
curricular O
decentralization O
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
details O
, O
standards O
and O
motor O
, O
cognitive O
and O
social O
skills O
are O
defined O
and O
then O
specialist O
companies O
can O
come O
in O
and O
set O
up O
curricula O
according O
to O
the O
areas O
in O
question O
because O
the O
experiences O
and O
interests O
of O
town O
people O
differ O
from O
the O

so O

The O

, O
numbering O
more O
than O
397 O
thousand O
pills O
inside O
his O
Mercedes B-PRODUCT
car O
at O
exactly O
three O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
thinking O
that O
the O
early O
hour O
would O
help O
him O
go O
past O
the O
road O
guards O
on O
his O
way O
to O
Riyadh B-LOC
. O

But O
the O
alertness O
of O
the O
road O
guards O
prevented O
the O
passing O
of O
this O
quantity O
on O
to O
our O
youth O
. O

This O
is O
considered O
one O
of O
the O
biggest O
caches O
seized O
in O
the O
district O
. O

The O
details O
of O
the O
case O
, O
after O
the O
arrest O
of O
the O
first O
person O
in O
whose O
possession O
were O
ten O
pills O
of O
the O
same O
kind O
that O
were O
seized O
, O
are O
that O
while O
there O
was O
no O
relation O
or O
connection O
between O
the O
two O
arrested O
men O
, O
the O
car O
was O
going O
back O
and O
forth O
between O
the B-LOC
Kingdom I-LOC
and O
his O
country O
, O
which O
made O
the O
road O
guards O
suspicious O
of O
a O
concealed O
matter O
. O

Accordingly O
, O
the O
1997 O
Mercedes B-PRODUCT
vehicle O
was O
searched O
. O

Plastic O
bags O
were O
found O
in O
the O
front O
and O
back O
doors O
, O
numbering O
397 O
bags O
, O
each O
containing O
a O
thousand O
pills O
. O

Immediately O
after O
they O
were O
seized O
, O
the O
arrested O
men O
were O
handed O
over O
directly O
to O
the B-ORG
Drug I-ORG
Combating I-ORG
Department I-ORG
. O

Our O
banks O
used O
to O
be O
and O
still O
are O
the O
most O
profitable O
in O
the O
world O
. O

Because O
the O
people O
are O
Muslims B-NORP
and O
do O
not O
accept O
interest O
from O
their O
bank O
accounts O
, O
this O
interest O
goes O
to O
the O
banks O
. O

After O
I O
read O
some O
bank O
publications O
about O
its O
outrageous O
profits O
in O
the B-MONEY
billions I-MONEY
of I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
, O
mostly O
from O
loans O
with O
exorbitant O
interest O
rates O
with O
which O
they O
controlled O
the O
citizens O
' O
salaries O
for O
many O
years O
to O
come O
, O
I O
am O
prompted O
to O
ask O
: O
Have O
you O
ever O
seen O
a O
charitable O
hospital O
for O
the O
citizens O
built O
by O
one O
of O
these O
banks O
? O

Have O
you O
seen O
a O
road O
or O
a O
street O
or O
a O
bridge O
or O
a O

built O
at O
the O
expense O
of O
a O

Have O
you O

a O

Have O
you O

a O

Have O
you O

an O

a O
young O
man O
get O
married O
, O
or O
study O
, O
or O
work O
coming O
from O
a O
bank O
? O

Have O
you O
heard O
about O
treatment O
of O
a O
citizen O
at O
the O
expense O
of O
a O
bank O
? O

Have O
you O
heard O
about O
awareness O
programs O
against O
corruption O
and O
drugs O
, O
support O
for O
the O
Ministry O
of O
Interior O
, O
and O
donations O
to O
eliminate O
them O
? O

All O
we O
have O
seen O
from O
the O
exploiters O
of O
the O
people O
is O
-LRB- O
Jewish B-NORP
interest O
loans O
-RRB O
and O
control O
of O
citizens O
' O
salaries O
for O
many O
years O
to O
come O
. O

We O
have O
heard O
nothing O
about O
their O
donations O
except O
for O
-LRB- O
a O
mosque B-FAC
and O
a O
facility O
to O
wash O
the O
dead O
-RRB- O
donated O
by O
-LRB- O
al O

Rajihi O
-RRB- O
out O
of O
the O
thousands O
of O
millions O
that O
he O
possesses O
in O
most O
cities O
. O

We O
say O
, O
" O
May O
God B-PERSON
reward O
him O
. O
" O

He O
is O
the O
best O
of O
the O
worst O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
donations O
. O

But O
mosques B-FAC
are O
everywhere O
and O
there O
is O
no O
shortage O
. O

The O
state O
has O
been O
and O
still O
is O
building O
mosques B-FAC
, O
but O
the O
nation O
needs O
to O
build O
hospitals B-FAC
, O
and O
to O
donate O
medicines O
and O
equipment O
, O
such O
as O
dialysis O
and O
heart O
equipment O
. O

The O
nation O
needs O
to O
build O
universities O
and O
schools O
, O
construct O
roads O
, O
help O
the O
unemployed O
, O
widows O
, O
orphans O

the O

eliminate O

. O

You O
owners O
of O
banks O
, O
may O
God B-PERSON
take O
away O
his O
blessings O
from O
you O
... O

How O
much O
have O
you O
profited O
and O
consumed O
from O
this O
nation O
? O

How O
often O
have O
you O
been O
ungrateful O
, O
criticized O
, O
done O
injustice O
, O
and O
afflicted O
misery O
on O
this O
nation O
and O
its O
people O
? O

In O
spite O
of O
the O
depressing O
scene O
engulfing O
the O
Arab B-NORP
world O
with O
its O
wars O
and O
crises O
, O
the O
balance O
of O
terror O
and O
the O
fear O
of O
escalating O
wars O
and O
crises O
may O
motivate O
those O
concerned O
into O
trying O
to O
find O
a O
way O
out O
of O
them O
, O
after O
each O
side O
has O
become O
aware O
of O
the O
dangers O
of O
escalation O
and O
the O
impasses O
ahead O
. O

The O
past O
six B-DATE
years I-DATE
have O
seen O
the O
greatest O
degree O
of O
military O
escalation O
and O
political O
aggravation O
in O
all O
the O
crises O
in O
the B-GPE
Middle I-GPE
East I-GPE
, O
and O
neither O
escalation O
nor O
aggravation O
has O
helped O
achieve O
the O
specific O
agendas O
of O
any O
side O
that O
has O
worked O
to O
provoke O
or O
inflame O
these O
crises O
. O

Without O
a O
doubt O
, O
the O
American B-NORP
administration O
is O
primarily O
responsible O
for O
igniting O
new O
crises O
or O
failing O
to O
put O
out O
old O
ones O
in O
the O
region O
. O

Six B-DATE
years I-DATE
have O
passed O
during O
which O
first O
Sharon B-PERSON
then O
Olmert B-PERSON
, O
and O
with O
great O
support O
from O
Bush B-PERSON
's O
administration O
, O
used O
the O
highest O
degree O
of O
Israeli B-NORP
violence O
against O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
people O
yet O
could O
not O
subjugate O
the O
Palestinians B-NORP
or O
put O
an O
end O
to O
their O
resistance O
. O

The O
Israeli B-NORP
military O
apparatus O
also O
conducted O
an O
all O
- O
out O
offensive O
war O
on O
Lebanon B-GPE
, O
with O
the O
open O
support O
of O
Bush B-PERSON
's O
administration O
, O
and O
did O
not O
succeed O
in O
achieving O
its O
goals O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
widespread O
destruction O
it O
created O
. O

As O
for O
Iraq B-GPE
, O
it O
has O
seen O
and O
continues O
to O
see O
the O
greatest O
degree O
of O
American B-NORP
military O
embroilment O
in O
the B-GPE
Middle I-GPE
East I-GPE
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
the O
history O
of O
the O
region O
, O
which O
will O
have O
a O
profound O
effect O
on O
the O
fate O
of O
American B-NORP
interests O
and O
the O
future O
of O
Arab B-NORP
- I-NORP
American I-NORP
relations O
. O

And O
many O
political O
and O
security O
crises O
will O
replicate O
from O
the O
womb O
of O
these O
wars O
in O
the O
lands O
of O
Palestine B-GPE
, O
Lebanon B-GPE
and O
Iraq B-GPE
, O
the O
most O
obvious O
of O
which O
is O
now O
the O
risk O
of O
sectarian O
, O
ideological O
and O
ethnic O
conflicts O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
conflicts O
relating O
to O
politics O
and O
the O
competition O
for O
power O
and O
authority O
, O
and O
at O
times O
even O
for O
opposition O
. O

Who O
in O
the O
construction O
company O
is O
robbing O
us O
? O

Who O
is O
developing O
Riyadh B-LOC
at O
our O
expense O
? O

Is O
the O
construction O
company O
a O
charitable O
company O
so O
that O
it O
should O
provide O
the O
Riyadh B-LOC
area O
with O
services O
at O
its O
own O
expense O
and O
without O
any O
economic O
feasibility O
? O

Does O
it O
make O
sense O
that O
a O
real O
estate O
company O
with O
a B-MONEY
capital I-MONEY
of I-MONEY
one I-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
ca O
n't O
make O
10 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of I-PERCENT
its O
capital O
? O

I O
mean O
, O
if O
you O
gave O
that O
sum O
to O
an O
uneducated O
Indian B-NORP
caretaker O
, O
he O
would O
make O
at O
least O
a O
10 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
profit I-PERCENT
from O
rentals O
. O

Other O
real O
estate O
companies O
make O
at O
least O
30 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
a O
year O
from O
their O
capital O
. O

These O
guys O
have O
set O
up O
a O
charity O
with O
our O
money O
or O
they O
're O
sharing O
out O
the B-PERCENT
20 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
in O
an O
indirect O
way O
!!! O

My O
God B-PERSON
, O
it O
's O
terrible O
that O
we O
should O
put O
our O
trust O
in O
thieves O
like O
these O
and O
I O
think O
we O
should O
stop O
keeping O
quiet O
and O
expose O
them O
... O

Do O
these O
thieves O
think O
we O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
they O
're O
doing O
and O
how O
they O
're O
stealing O
? O
And O
who O
is O
robbing O
us O
behind O
our O
backs O
? O

We O
thought O
they O
would O
stop O
stealing O
and O
give O
us O
what O
we O
are O
due O
but O
it O
seems O
that O
they O
despise O
our O
ability O
to O
stop O
them O
and O
expose O
them O
... O
but O
when O
we O
do O
, O
their O
pleading O
will O
be O
useless O
. O

King O
Abdul B-PERSON
Aziz I-PERSON
, O
God B-PERSON
rest O
his O
soul O
, O
was O
wise O
when O
he O
said O
do O
not O
combine O
government O
and O
trade O
!! O

Choose O
either O
government O
or O
trade O
because O
combining O
the O
two O
sooner O
or O
later O
leads O
to O
the O
government O
being O
toppled O
and O
trade O
being O
unprofitable O
. O

In O
a O
press O
interview O
, O
the O
Israeli B-NORP
Prime O
Minister O
Ehud B-PERSON
Olmert I-PERSON
said O
that O
major O
democratic O
countries O
with O
nuclear O
capabilities O
, O
such O
as O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
, O
France B-GPE
, O
Russia B-GPE
and O
Israel B-GPE
, O
do O
not O
threaten O
to O
exterminate O
and O
crush O
states O
and O
nations O
. O

Olmert B-PERSON
was O
referring O
to O
Iranian B-NORP
President O
Ahmedinejad B-PERSON
's O
statements O
about O
wiping O
Israel B-GPE
off O
the O
map O
... O
but O
what O
is O
significant O
here O
in O
these O
statements O
is O
the O
mention O
of O
Israel B-GPE
as O
one O
of O
the O
major O
countries O
in O
the O
nuclear O
club O
, O
although O
this O
is O
not O
true O
from O
a O
procedural O
point O
of O
view O
. O

However O
, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
time O
an O
Israel B-NORP
official O
, O
represented O
in O
the O
form O
of O
the O
Israeli B-NORP
Prime O
Minister O
, O
has O
formally O
mentioned O
that O
Israel B-GPE
possesses O
nuclear O
weapons O
. O

While O
this O
came O
as O
no O
surprise O
to O
everyone O
near O
and O
far O
, O
this O
announcement O
disturbed O
and O
angered O
various O
Israeli B-NORP
forces O
, O
some O
of O
whom O
went O
about O
calling O
for O
Olmert B-PERSON
's O
resignation O
. O

Since O
Israel B-GPE
started O
its O
nuclear O
program O
in O
the B-DATE
sixties I-DATE
with O
French B-NORP
assistance O
, O
it O
has O
been O
shrouded O
in O
mystery O
. O

Voices O
emerged O
out O
of O
Israel B-GPE
strongly O
denying O
the O
existence O
of O
any O
Israeli B-NORP
nuclear O
weapons O
on O
the O
basis O
that O
no O
nuclear O
test O
explosions O
had O
been O
conducted O
inside O
Israel B-GPE
. O

This O
is O
where O
an O
Arab B-NORP
stance O
was O
needed O
but O
everyone O
greeted O
the O
news O
coolly O
and O
calmly O
, O
as O
if O
the O
whole O
issue O
was O
of O
no O
concern O
to O
us O
, O
whether O
closely O
or O
remotely O
, O
or O
as O
if O
Israel B-GPE
were O
located O
at O
the B-LOC
North I-LOC
Pole I-LOC
. O

An O
issue O
such O
as O
this O
really O
calls O
for O
an O
Arab B-NORP
position O
to O
be O
taken O
and O
anger O
to O
be O
expressed O
but O
it O
is O
as O
if O
Arab B-NORP
anger O
towards O
Israel B-GPE
is O
not O
allowed O
and O
is O
something O
that O
is O
forbidden O
to O
us O
. O

The O
least O
requirement O
is O
to O
engage O
the O
international O
community O
in O
pressuring O
Israel B-GPE
into O
signing O
the O
nuclear O
nonproliferation O
treaty O
, O
which O
the O
majority O
of O
Arab B-NORP
and O
Islamic B-NORP
countries O
have O
signed O
, O
including O
Egypt B-GPE
and O
Iran B-GPE
. O

After O
the O
devastating O
and O
disgraceful O
failure O
whether O
at O
the O
world O
championship O
level O
or O
even O
at O
the O
continental O
championship O
level O
, O
like O
now O
in O
Doha B-GPE
in O
Asia B-GPE
, O
personally O
and O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
female O
gender O
, O
I O
express O
to O
you O
, O
the O
young O
men O
of O
Saudi B-GPE
Arabia I-GPE
, O
our O
complete O
readiness O
as O
members O
of O
the O
female O
gender O
, O
to O
watch O
you O
bring O
about O
the O
defeat O
this O
time O
of O
Doha B-GPE
in O
Qatar B-GPE
. O

And O
in O
any O
international O
forum O
, O
as O
you O
have O
accustomed O
us O
to O
, O
and O
in O
every O
challenge O
to O
human O
strength O
which O
attests O
to O
what O
the O
human O
body O
can O
achieve O
in O
its O
strength O
and O
precision O
, O
its O
patience O
and O
art O
. O
We O
are O
ready O
to O
pat O
you O
on O
the O
back O
and O
caress O
your O
shoulders O
, O
console O
you O
in O
your O
sadness O
, O
wipe O
the O
tears O
from O
your O
cheeks O
. O
And O
to O
recite O
the O
prayers O
of O
the O
old O
ladies O
asking O
the B-PERSON
Creator I-PERSON
to O
compensate O
you O
with O
better O
championships O
next O
time O
. O

It O
has O
become O
the O
norm O
to O
receive O
Saudi B-NORP
youth O
empty O
- O
handed O
. O

It O
has O
become O
the O
norm O
for O
you O
, O
the O
young O
men O
, O
not O
to O
raise O
the O
flag O
of O
monotheism O
among O
the O
flags O
of O
nations O
. O

It O
has O
become O
the O
expected O
scenario O
that O
we O
only O
hear O
from O
you O
, O
young O
men O
, O
promises O
about O
the O
coming O
championships O
. O

Because O
each O
championship O
is O
followed O
by O
another O
, O
there O
is O
no O
definite O
time O
as O
to O
how O
close O
the O
era O
of O
challenge O
is O
or O
the O
golden O
era O
when O
medallions O
are O
drawn O
on O
your O
chests O
, O
not O
in O
the O
near O
future O
nor O
even O
in O
eternity O
. O

Despite O
all O
your O
failures O
we O
find O
you O
depriving O
us O
, O
the O
female O
gender O
, O
and O
in O
a O
discriminating O
way O
, O
of O
engaging O
in O
challenging O
the O
nations O
. O

We O
find O
the O
public O
welfare O
-LRB- O
of O
youth O
-RRB- O
limiting O
its O
activity O
to O
a O
gender O
that O
confirms O
its O
failure O
not O
once O
and O
not O
even O
a O
thousand O
times O
. O

Why O
not O
open O
the O
doors O
for O
girls O
to O
exercise O
their O
human O
rights O
, O
to O
confirm O
their O
freedom O
which O
was O
guaranteed O
by O
religion O
, O
law O
, O
and O
humanity O
, O
so O
they O
can O
stand O
tall O
holding O
the O
flag O
that O
says O
" O
There O
is O
no O
god O
except O
God B-PERSON
, O
and O
Muhammad B-PERSON
is O
the O
messenger O
of O
God B-PERSON
" O
among O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
girls O
of O
the O
Asian B-NORP
continent O
? O

I O
wish O
that O
the O
general O
management O
, O
represented O
by O
the B-ORG
Soccer I-ORG

the O
primary O

in O
the O

There O
are O
only O
two O
major O
reasons O
that O
may O
make O
the O

favor O
one O

over O
another O
. O

The O
first O
one O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
might O
be O
the O
fear O
of O
Al B-ORG

Hilal I-ORG

domineering O

chaotic O

immoral O
, O
and O

the O
reason O

the O

backwardness O
that O

in O

Frankly O
, O
I O
find O
the O
utter O
silence O
from O
the O

strange O
. O

The O
second O
one O
might O
be O
that O
some O
of O
our O

take O
bribes O
, O
God B-PERSON
forbid O
. O

About O
four O
years O

, O
the B-ORG

How O
similar O

today O

The O
refereeing O
mistakes O
that O

the O

all O
continue O

What O
did O
we O
get O
from O

as O
long O
as O
the O
main O
reasons O
have O
not O
been O
removed O
? O

The O
mistakes O
are O
still O
the O
same O
and O
in O
favor O
of O
only O
one O

. O

It O
's O
too O
bad O
about O
our O
money O
, O
our O
effort O
, O
and O
our O

as O
long O
as O
the O
recent O

He O

presence O
through O
its O
continued O
and O
sincere O
work O
in O
spite O
of O
circumstances O
that O
were O
enough O
to O
bring O
down O
any O
other O
government O
. O

As O
time O
passed O
, O
they O
felt O
that O
time O
was O
not O
on O
their O
side O
... O
and O
that O
, O
as O
time O
passed O
, O
Hamas B-NORP
and O
its O
project O
and O
proposals O
were O
becoming O
deeply O
rooted O
in O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
and O
Arab B-NORP
political O
and O
social O
reality O
... O
especially O
after O
the O
recent O
successful O
tour O
by O
Palestinian B-NORP
Prime O
Minister O
Ismail B-PERSON
Haniya I-PERSON
to O
a O
number O
of O
Arab B-NORP
and O
Muslim B-NORP
countries O
. O

Therefore O
, O
these O
parties O
have O
realized O
that O
the O
time O
has O
come O
to O
throw O
in O
the O
final O
card O
in O
a O
series O
of O
plots O
and O
treachery O
... O
by O
means O
of O
a O
coup O
against O
Hamas B-NORP
through O
a O
call O
for O
elections O
. O

Abbas B-PERSON
and O
his O
group O
are O
facing O
Hamas B-NORP
because O
it O
has O
succeeded O
... O
if O
it O
had O
failed O
or O
if O
it O
was O
expected O
to O
fail O
... O
they O
would O
have O
left O
it O
until O
it O
completed O
its O
lawful O
term O
... O
in O
order O
to O
abort O
its O
legitimacy O
... O
its O
project O
... O
and O
its O
popularity O
in O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
arena O
. O

Its O
success O
strips O
them O
bare O
and O
shows O
their O
real O
size O
... O
and O
brings O
down O
their O
proposals O
and O
projects O
. O

Some O
Arabs B-NORP
want O
to O
topple O
Hamas B-NORP
because O
it O
is O
the O
first O
government O
formed O
by O
elected O
Islamists B-NORP
... O
and O
this O
threatens O
the O
mummified O
Arab B-NORP
governments O
... O
these O
relics O
that O
have O
been O
here O
for O
dozens O
of O
years O
! O

In O
spite O
of O
their O
failure O
... O
and O
lack O
of O
popular O
legitimacy O
. O

Next O

God B-PERSON
willing O

the O

The O

will O
be O
available O
in O
the O
Saudi B-NORP

-LRB- O

after O
the O

of O
the O

is O
completed O
without O
any O
media O
fuss O
, O
in O
order O
to O
avoid O
public O
opinion O
, O
which O
causes O
a O
big O
fuss O
, O
refusing O
this O
merge O
. O

The O
Saudi B-NORP
Channel O
started O
preparing O
for O
the O
issue O
two O
days O
ago O
and O
asked O
citizens O
about O
their O
opinion O
on O
consolidating O
the O
water O
and O
electricity O
bills O
. O

The O
only O
reason O
for O
their O
merge O
is O
very O
, O
very O
silly O
; O
namely O
, O
the O
designation O
of O
the B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
of I-ORG
Water I-ORG
and I-ORG
Electricity I-ORG
by O
this O
name O
requires O
also O
a O
consolidated O
bill O
for O
water O
and O
electricity O
. O

The O
fine O
for O
disconnecting O
the O
electricity O
meter O
and O
turning O
back O
the O
reading O
is O
ten B-MONEY
riyals I-MONEY
, O
and O
the O
fine O
for O
pilfering O
water O
is O
two B-MONEY
hundred I-MONEY
riyals I-MONEY
. O

Will O
the O
fine O
for O
pilfering O
water O
be O
consolidated O
with O
the O
electricity O
one O
to O
be O
ten B-MONEY
riyals I-MONEY
? O

Brother O
, O
what O
are O
the O
repercussions O
of O
these O
bills O
on O
a O
large O
section O
of O
citizens O
who O
can O
barely O
pay O
the O
electricity O
bill O
itself O
? O

Why O
should O
you O
care O
about O
the O
water O
and O
electricity O
bill O
? O

Did O
n't O
this O
minister O
see O
the O
women O
sitting O
in O
front O
of O
the O
entrance O
to O
Kharis B-LOC
Services O
with O
the O
electricity O
bills O
in O
their O
hands O
, O
pleading O
for O
the O
reviewers O
to O
help O
them O
pay O
them O
? O

The O
news O
is O
correct O
and O
100 O
% O
confirmed O
, O
for O
correspondence O
. O

I O
can O
not O
assume O
the O
personality O
a O
Lebanese B-NORP
, O
especially O
one O
from O
Hezbollah B-NORP
, O
but O
I O
will O
describe O
some O
of O
the O
daily O
features O
of O
the O
demonstrations O
. O

The O
crowd O
mixture O
of O
demonstrations O
is O
made O
up O
of O
Shiite B-NORP
Lebanese I-NORP
and O
some B-NORP
Christian I-NORP
followers I-NORP
of I-NORP
Aoun I-NORP
. O

Of O
course O
, O
we O
do O
not O
forget O
our O
Syrian B-NORP
brothers O
. O

A O
demonstrator O
is O
paid O
the O
sum O
of O
twenty B-MONEY
American I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
daily O
, O
equivalent O
to O
75 B-MONEY
riyals I-MONEY
per O
day O
. O

If O
we O
multiply O
that O
by O
30 B-DATE
days I-DATE
, O
it O
would O
be O
equivalent O
to O
the O
salary O
of O
a O
Saudi B-NORP
employee O
in O
a O
phone O
kiosk O
, O
maybe O
more O
. O

You O
do O
the O
math O
. O

It O
is O
notable O
that O
the O
demonstrations O
came O
just O
in O
time O
to O
ruin O
the O
holiday O
season O
in O
Lebanon B-LOC
, O
especially O
in O
the O
area O
of O
central O
Beirut B-LOC
, O
known O
by O
the O
Saudis B-NORP
as O
Solidaire B-LOC

Investments O
in O
Solidaire B-LOC
are O
by O
Christians B-NORP
and O
Sunni B-NORP
Muslims I-NORP

There O
are O
no O
Shiite B-NORP
investments O
, O
neither O
in O
tourism O
nor O
in O
Solidaire B-LOC

Their O
investments O
are O
only O
in O
the O
mountain O
restaurants O
on O
the O
South O

Our O

afraid O
to O

in O
Shiite B-NORP

The O
time O

came O
in O

so O
the O
demonstrators O
needed O
heat O
. O

They O
could O
only O
find O
wood O
in O
the O

, O
which O
were O
totally O

Lebanese B-NORP
people O
gather O
in O
the O

a O

them O
smoke O
hashish O

Look O

the O

They O
look O

Imagine O
how O
the O

Four O
years O
ago O
, O
a O
Swiss B-NORP
university O
colleague O
invited O
me O
to O
give O
a O
presentation O
/ O
lecture O
on O
Iraq B-GPE
... O

My O
colleague O
had O
been O
asked O
by O
an O
organization O
concerned O
with O
handicapped O
younth O
to O
prepare O
a O
cultural O
, O
entertaining O
, O
and O
educational O
program O
for O
this O
kind O
of O
audience O
... O

She O
had O
the O
idea O
of O
presenting O
fifteen B-CARDINAL
countries O
as O
a O
representative O
sample O
of O
the O
continents O
and O
cultures O
of O
the O
world O
, O
and O
that O
individuals O
from O
those O
countries O
would O
present O
their O
countries O
... O

She O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
was O
willing O
to O
participate O
and O
present O
Iraq B-GPE
in O
this O
activity O
, O
so O
that O
she O
could O
add O
Iraq B-GPE
to O
the O
list O
of O
those O
countries O
... O

and O
I O
do O
not O
miss O
a O
chance O
to O
talk O
about O
Iraq B-GPE
... O

I O
accepted O
, O
but O
honestly O
, O
I O
was O
scared O
at O
the O
time O
in O
front O
of O
this O
kind O
of O
audience O
, O
which O
requires O
greater O
attention O
and O
effort O
from O
you O
... O

Part O
of O
the O
program O
was O
to O
bring O
in O
something O
to O
taste O
, O
from O
the O
country O
we O
were O
representing O
... O
something O
to O
be O
eaten O
or O
drunk O
that O
the O
participants O
could O
taste O
, O
and O
so O
that O
the O
country O
could O
have O
tangible O
representation O
... O

Without O
hesitation O
, O
I O
gave O
a O
slide O
presentation O
using O
" B-PRODUCT
Power I-PRODUCT
Point I-PRODUCT
" I-PRODUCT
... O

and O
I O
chose O
, O
with O
a O
little O
hesitation O
, O
to O
make O
them O
Iraqi B-NORP
tea O
, O
Abu B-NORP
Al I-NORP
Hail I-NORP
tea O
. O

The O
result O
was O
pleasing O
to O
the O
audience O
, O
who O
liked O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
tea O
and O
the O
slide O

approach O
... O

My O
colleague O
later O
told O
me O
that O
I O
was O
the O
only O

to O
use O
a O

with O

that O
the O

I O
did O
not O
doubt O
the O
power O
of O
this O
program O
on O
the O
imagination O
of O
this O
kind O
of O
audience O

That O
is O
why O
I O
chose O
it O
... O

but O
I O
was O
afraid O
they O
would O
not O
like O
the O
taste O
of O
Abu B-NORP
Al I-NORP
Hail I-NORP
tea O
, O
which O
might O
be O
from O
another O

But O
they O
liked O
it O

a O
great O

I O
was O

I O
was O

At O

and O
I O
wanted O

I O
wish O

so O
the O

the O

The O

is O
that O
the O

shall O

Peace O

What O
I O
want O
to O
talk O
about O
in O
this O
topic O
is O
the O
increase O
in O
the O
price O

everything O
without O

Is O
it O
theft O
or O
is O
it O
a O
genuine O
increase O
which O
is O
subject O

the O
circumstances O
that O
caused O
the O
increase O

Everything O
has O
doubled O
in O
price O
and O
no O
one O
is O
keeping O
an O
eye O
on O
it O

What O
's O
strange O
is O
that O
when O
I O
asked O
someone O
why O
the O
price O
of O
agricultural O
materials O
has O
increased O
when O
most O
of O
it O
is O
produced O
locally O
, O
he O
answered O
me O
, O
" O
Visit O
the O
wholesale O
center O
and O
you O
'll O
discover O
that O
those O
who O
are O
increasing O
the O

are O

an O
eye O
on O
them O
" O
. O

So O
where O
is O
the B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
of I-ORG
Trade I-ORG
to O
give O
us O
the O
main O
reason O
for O
these O
increases O
in O
all O
goods O
? O

What O
is O
strange O
is O
that O
engine O
oil O
is O
priced O
but O
the O
real O
price O
is O
n't O
anything O
like O
it O
, O
I O
mean O
the O
company O
steals O
in O
broad O
daylight O
. O

One O
of O
the O
oil O
sellers O
told O
me O
that O
the O
posted O
price O
is O
just O
a O
suggested O
retail O
price O
and O
not O
the O
real O
price O
and O
that O
you O
have O
to O
buy O
in O
bulk O
to O
get O
the O
real O
price O
. O

So O
who O
is O
responsible O
for O
this O
? O

And O
how O
can O
any O
employee O
with O
a O
salary O
that O
's O
barely O
enough O
to O
live O
on O
cope O
with O
these O
unjustified O
increases O
? O

So O
who O
is O
responsible O
? O

By O
the O
way O
, O
in O
order O
to O
protect O
its O
citizens O
, O
a O
neighboring O
state O
announces O
the O
price O
of O
merchandise O
daily O
over O
the O
radio O
or O
by O
printing O
the O
prices O
in O
one O
of O
the O
newspapers O
. O

So O
what O
is O
the B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
of I-ORG
Trade I-ORG
doing O
to O
protect O
us O
from O
traders O
? O

My O
brother O
Hamid B-PERSON
, O
The O
decision O
to O
close O
down O
the O
group O
is O
basically O
up O
to O
you O
. O

Maybe O
this O
decision O
will O
encourage O
some O
to O
create O
their O
own O
groups O
or O
participate O
more O
. O

I O
do O
not O
know O
. O

In O
all O
cases O
, O
the O
correspondence O
gave O
everyone O
including O
me O
the O
opportunity O
to O
communicate O
and O
learn O
about O
other O
different O
views O
. O

In O
this O
respect O
, O
I O
am O
grateful O
for O
this O
effort O
. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
know O
the O
primary O
goal O
that O
you O
perceived O
when O
you O
decided O
to O
proceed O
with O
this O
initiative O
. O

Maybe O
then O
I O
can O
understand O
your O
decision O
to O
close O
it O
, O
if O
that O
is O
what O
you O
want O
, O
of O
course O
. O

My O
view O
on O
this O
matter O
is O
that O
it O
has O
- O
the O
group O
- O
accomplished O
some O
sort O
of O
achievement O
. O

The O
obvious O
negativity O
from O
some O
does O
not O
mean O
that O
you O
will O
not O
face O
negativity O
in O
life O
, O
in O
the O
community O
. O

This O
is O
important O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
fear O
that O
some O
might O
have O
- O
from O
the O
security O
aspect O
- O
who O
are O
burdened O
with O
ideas O
rejecting O
the O
other O
, O
and O
maybe O
the O
desire O
to O
eliminate O
him O
and O
ca O
n't O
frankly O
and O
openly O
express O
their O
ideas O
to O
the O
extent O
that O
they O
desire O
. O

This O
is O
understandable O
. O

I O
previously O
informed O
those O
who O
want O
to O
participate O
in O
a O
blog O
I O
started O
, O
on O
-LRB- O
blogger O
-RRB- O
but O
got O
no O
response O
. O

Later O
I O
learned O
that O
the O
blogger O
was O
blocked O
. O

I O
hope O
this O
is O
the O
reason O
and O
not O
the O
intellectual O
guardianship O
or O
the O
spiral O
self O
- O
withdrawal O
:--LRB- O

Despite O
my O
feeling O
for O
several O
times O
that O
you O
and O
I O
do O
not O
agree O
, O
I O
wish O
you O
prosperity O
and O
luck O
. O

Greetings O
. O

I O
am O
sorry O
if O
I O
am O
bothering O
you O
, O
but O
I O
found O
your O
email O
on O
the O
blog O
, O
and O
I O
need O
you O
to O
relay O
my O
question O
to O
whoever O
can O
answer O
. O

God B-PERSON
's I-PERSON
will O
for O
me O
was O
that O
I O
was O
in O
an O
accident O
in O
Riyadh B-GPE
four O
months O
ago O
. O

Thank O
God B-PERSON
, O
I O
was O
not O
hurt O
. O

When O
the O
security O
patrols O
arrived O
, O
the O
other O
party O
was O
held O
100 O
% O
responsible O
for O
the O
accident O
. O

The O
other O
party O
carried O
a O
card O
for O
insurance O
under O
the O
name O
Salamat B-ORG
Program I-ORG
. O

After O
assessing O
the O
accident O
, O
the O
amount O
of O
compensation O
amount O
was O
set O
at O
10,000 B-MONEY
riyals I-MONEY
. O

From O
the O
date O
7/25/2006 B-DATE
, O
and O
until O
this O
moment O
, O
I O
have O
been O
requesting O
this O
amount O
from O
the O
insurance O
company O
. O

To O
this O
day O
, O
I O
have O
not O
seen O
one B-MONEY
riyal I-MONEY

I O
found O
nothing O
but O
procrastination O
and O
evasion O
. O

Each O
day O
, O
they O
say O
call O
tomorrow O
, O
that O
is O
, O
if O
you O
find O
someone O
to O
answer O
your O
call O

The O
question O
? O

To O
which O
government O
authority O
should O
I O
file O
my O
complaint O
in O
order O
to O
get O
all O
that O
is O
my O
due O
without O
procrastination O
and O
evasion O
from O
the O
company O
? O

Should O
I O
complain O
to O
the B-ORG
Office I-ORG
of I-ORG
the I-ORG
Ombudsmen I-ORG
, O
or O
the B-ORG
Chambers I-ORG
of I-ORG
Commerce I-ORG
, O
or O
, O

I O
hope O
to O
find O
a O
solution O
through O
you O
, O
knowing O
that O
the O
company O
is O
called O
the B-ORG
United I-ORG
Group I-ORG
for I-ORG
Cooperative I-ORG
Insurance I-ORG
, O
and O
its O
headquarters O
is O
in O
Jeddah B-GPE
. O

I O
thank O
anyone O
who O
tries O
to O
help O
me O
. O

God B-PERSON
grant O
us O
success O
. O

I O
want O
my O
voice O
and O
the O
voice O
of O
every O
citizen O
to O
be O
heard O
, O
male O
and O
female O
, O
who O
cares O
about O
the O
reputation O
of O
Medina B-LOC
, O
in O
the O
form O
and O
substance O
of O
our O
Muslim B-NORP
moral O
values O
, O
of O
what O
we O
the O
people O
of O
Medina B-LOC
, O
neighbors O
of O
the O
Messenger O
of O
God B-PERSON
-LRB- O
Peace O
Be O
Upon O
Him O
-RRB- O
, O
see O
. O
... O
because O
it O
makes O
the O
heart O
bleed O
and O
brings O
tears O
to O
the O
eyes O
... O

what O
we O
see O
on O
this O
street O
depresses O
us O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
it O
has O
turned O
into O
a O
street O
for O
immoral O
youth O
gatherings O
which O
distort O
the O
public O
image O
this O
street O
has O
. O

It O
is O
called O
Sultana B-LOC
Street I-LOC

In O
the O
past O
, O
it O
was O
a O
breathing O
space O
for O
the O
people O
of O
Medina B-LOC
. O

It O
is O
very O
important O
because O
it O
has O
shopping O
malls O
, O
stores O
and O
restaurants O
. O

The O
people O
of O
Medina B-LOC
come O
here O
on O
Wednesdays B-DATE
, I-DATE
Thursdays I-DATE
and I-DATE
Fridays I-DATE
. O

But O
now O
, O
it O
has O
become O
unbearable O
and O
we O
ca O
n't O
go O
there O
even O
if O
we O
have O
our O
men O
with O
us O
. O

So O
we O
have O
to O
make O
do O
with O
small O
restaurants O
and O
shops O
faraway O
from O
this O
street O
. O

There O
are O
groups O
of O
youths O
on O
the O
sidewalks O
and O
as O
for O
their O
clothes O
, O
one O
feels O
too O
embarrassed O
to O
look O
. O

I O
feel O
like O
their O
pants O
are O
about O
to O
drop O
as O
they O
're O
so O
low O
down O
on O
the O
waist O
. O

All O
they O
care O
about O
is O
finding O
women O
and O
harassing O
them O
. O

Even O
a O
married O
woman O
walking O
with O
her O
children O
is O
not O
safe O
from O
their O
harassment O
. O

I O
swear O
, O
some O
groups O
of O
young O
people O
set O
up O
teams O
to O
skate O
on O
the O
sidewalk O
and O
street O
and O
go O
between O
cars O
on O
what O
they O
call O
skateboards B-PRODUCT

In O
behavior O
that O
is O
strange O
to O
Saudi B-NORP
society O
, O
known O
for O
its O
rejection O
of O
all O
forms O
of O

, O
the B-ORG

with O
great O

an O
article O
that O
a O
Saudi B-NORP

published O
for O
one O

He O
asked O
for O
four O
people O
to O
help O
him O
to O
carry O
out O
his O
plan O

and O
he O
explained O
in O

the O
style O
of O
the O
operation O

way O

in O

the O

This O

had O
justified O
his O

the O
result O
of O
the O

The O

that O
the O

This O

in O
an O

He O
also O
described O
the O
current O

previous O

as O
sectarian O
and O
exclusive O
governments O
that O
kill O
Sunnis B-NORP
and O
assist O
the O

doing O
so O

He O
also O
described O
Al B-PERSON

Maliki I-PERSON
as O
the O
most O
exclusive O
person O
, O
whose O
motto O
is O
murder O
, O
then O
murder O

then O
murder O

he O

He O

" O

As O
for O
the O

project O
that O
Al B-PERSON

has O
announced O
, O
Mishaan B-PERSON
said O
this O
project O
has O
no O
basis O
in O
fact O
and O
that O
what O
Al B-PERSON

Maliki I-PERSON
did O
was O
only O
to O
satisfy O
the O
Americans B-NORP
and O
trick O
certain O
politicians O

and O
that O
his O

, O
who O
strive O

the O

is O
nothing O
but O
proof O
of O
this O
. O

Mishaan B-PERSON
Al I-PERSON

Jubouri I-PERSON
accused O
Moqtada B-PERSON
Al I-PERSON
Sadr I-PERSON

his O
Mahdi B-ORG
Army I-ORG

of O
killing O
Sunnis B-NORP

with O

from O
an O
outside O

in O
reference O

He O
said O
that O
there O
was O
a O
committee O

in O
Brussels B-GPE
that O
was O
gathering O
evidence O
on O
the O
crimes O
of O
Moqtada B-PERSON
Al I-PERSON
Sadr I-PERSON
and O
his O
militias O
. O

It O
is O
worth O
noting O
that O
Mishaan B-PERSON
Al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Jubouri I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
immunity O
was O
withdrawn O
due O
to O
accusations O
of O
corruption O
from O

and O
that O
the B-ORG

In O
spite O
of O
the O
crimes O

atrocities O
that O
the B-GPE

is O
committing O
under O
the O
leadership O
of O

the O
number O
one O
terrorist O
in O
the O
world O

his O
gang O
of O
Zionists B-NORP
, O
this O
hoodlum O
continues O
to O
insist O
that O
the O
world O
has O
become O
safer O
after O
all O
this O
destruction O
and O
killing O
of O
Muslims B-NORP
and O
the O
innocent O
everywhere O
. O

It O
is O
obvious O
from O
reading O
about O
all O
these O
events O
that O
we O
find O
that O
the O
American B-NORP
pirate O
is O
looking O
for O
an O
exit O
from O
these O
successive O
defeats O
and O
from O
the O
blows O
that O
assail O
them O
from O
all O
directions O
. O

The O
American B-NORP
giant O
and O
mighty O
colossus O
has O
become O
a O
frightened O
mouse O
thanks O
to O
the O
Islamic B-NORP
resistance O
in O
Afghanistan B-GPE
and O
Iraq B-GPE
, O
and O
through O
the O
cheap O

superficial O
settlement O
of O

question O
with O
the O

that O

ultimately O
at O
the O

That O
is O
why O

supported O
by O
Israel B-GPE
, O
intended O
to O
offer O
some O
concessions O

the O
most O
important O
of O
which O
is O
to O
choke O

besiege O
the O

it O

no O

that O

The O
Arab B-NORP
peninsula O
is O
characterized O
by O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
tribal O
variety O
and O
each O
of O
these O
tribes O
has O
its O
own O
way O
of O
receiving O
guests O
and O
preparing O
feasts O
. O

It O
might O
resemble O
some O
other O
tribes O
or O
be O
unique O
to O
them O
and O
some O
brothers O
may O
be O
surprised O
, O
especially O
local O
residents O
attending O
feasts O
, O
particularly O
if O
it O
is O
in O
their O
' O
stronghold O
' O
, O
i.e. O
the O
area O
they O
live O
in O
. O

Among O
these O
customs O
, O
some O
of O
which O
we O
have O
seen O
and O
some O
of O
which O
we O
have O
heard O
about O
, O
I O
'll O
describe O
a O
few O
and O
I O
look O
forward O
to O
people O
expressing O
their O
opinions O
to O
enrich O
the O
subject O
so O
that O
we O
can O
all O
learn O
about O
these O
customs O
. O

For O
example O
, O
some O
tribes O
will O
only O
eat O
after O
the O
guest O
has O
eaten O
and O
will O
only O
finish O
after O
he O
finishes O
, O
even O
if O
he O
stays O
for O
a O
full O
hour O
. O

Some O
get O
angry O
if O
the O
slaughtered O
animal O
which O
they O
have O
been O
honored O
with O
contains O
certain O
parts O
such O
as O
the O
neck O
, O
for O
example O
, O
or O
that O
you O
eat O
the O
tongue O
of O
the O
slaughtered O
animal O
. O

Some O
will O
offer O
you O
food O
then O
leave O
you O
and O
your O
family O
to O
eat O
alone O
. O

Some O
will O
turn O
off O
the O
lights O
so O
that O
you O
feel O
more O
comfortable O
when O
eating O
your O
food O
and O
so O
that O
you O
do O
n't O
feel O
as O
if O
someone O
is O
watching O
you O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
many O
other O
customs O
. O

And O
perhaps O
there O
are O
even O
stranger O
customs O
other O
than O
the O
ones O
mentioned O
when O
you O
send O
in O
your O
comments O
on O
the O
subject O
. O

So O
see O
you O

As O
a O
woman O
who O
sees O
herself O
as O
belonging O
to O
a O
conservative B-NORP
society O
, O
I O
have O
lived O
for O
many O
years O
of O
my O
life O
in O
ignorance O
of O
this O
world O
... O

My O
knowledge O
about O
male O
interests O
and O
their O
level O
of O
thinking O
and O
thought O
was O
limited O
to O
" O
what O
I O
saw O
" O
from O
my O
male O
relatives O
... O
a O
small O
number O
I O
compared O
a O
whole O
world O
to O
... O

I O
began O
to O
read O
and O
think O
... O
and O
found O
that O
the O
circle O
was O
wider O
than O
I O
had O
thought O
... O

My O
reading O
broadened O
... O
and O
as O
it O
did O
, O
so O
did O
my O
wonder O
! O

The O
relationship O
between O
men O
and O
women O
has O
never O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
been O
one O
of O
conflict O
... O
also O
in O
comparison O
to O
my O
little O
world O
. O

We O
might O
have O
a O
few O
lighthearted O
clashes O
... O

But O
I O
never O
thought O
there O
would O
be O
people O
on O
this O
earth O
who O
would O
embrace O
these O
ideas O
as O
belief O
! O

I O
have O
read O
a O
lot O
about O
the O
marginalization O
of O
women O
... O
their O
degradation O
... O
their O
undervaluing O
... O
by O
Arabs B-NORP
and O
foreigners O
... O
by O
Muslims B-NORP
and O
disbelievers O
... O
by O
the O
ancients O
and O
contemporary O
people O
. O

Such O
talk O
would O
be O
met O
with O
anger O
and O
counter-attacks O
by O
some O
women O
... O
by O
evasion O
and O
disregard O
by O
some O
... O
and O
submission O
and O
defeat O
by O
others O
. O

I O
have O
read O
a O
lot O
of O
proverbs O
that O
belittle O
women O
... O

But O
I O
have O
never O
read O
a O
proverb O
by O
a O
woman O
making O
fun O
of O
men O
... O
how O
sensible O
women O
are O
! O
:-LRB- O

What O
is O
even O
nicer O
is O
that O
I O
did O
not O
find O
an O
offensive O
proverb O
about O
women O
by O
people O
whose O
intellect O
, O
knowledge O
, O
ideas O
and O
religion O
I O
value O
! O

And O
if O
something O
like O
that O
came O
out O
of O
one O
of O
them O
at O
some O
moment O
... O
they O
would O
quickly O
express O
regret O
and O
apologize O
! O

We O
have O
lived O
for O
many O
years O
hearing O
, O
seeing O
and O
reading O
comparisons O
between O
men O
and O
women O

It O
has O
come O

a O

Al B-ORG

succeeded O

Suddenly O

an O

The O

In O
the B-DATE
summer I-DATE
of I-DATE
2006 I-DATE
, O
Hezbollah B-NORP
forces O
crossed O
over O
and O
abducted O
two B-CARDINAL
Israeli B-NORP
soldiers O
and O
killed O
a O
few O
others O
in O
the O
same O
way O
that O
the O
Hamas B-NORP
movement O
did O
unexpectedly O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
days I-DATE
before I-DATE
Hezbollah B-NORP
did O
the O
same O
. O

What O
was O
the O
outcome O
?? O

The O
Israeli B-NORP
forces O
responded O
inhumanely O
and O
viciously O
against O
south O
Lebanon B-GPE
, O
which O
led O
to O
the O
death O
of O
hundreds B-CARDINAL
of O
people O
, O
families O
and O
dreams O
. O

There O
is O
no O
question O
that O
Israel B-GPE
is O
to O
blame O
for O
these O
massacres O
and O
should O
be O
condemned O
and O
punished O
. O

-LRB- O
This O
of O
course O
will O
not O
happen O
now O
-RRB- O
. O

But O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
politics O
is O
harsh O
. O

Politics O
unfortunately O
is O
not O
based O
on O
principles O
and O
idealism O
but O
on O
reality O
. O

When O
you O
are O
in O
a O
zoo O
, O
you O
do O
not O
find O
the O
lions O
roaming O
freely O
, O
rather O
they O
are O
chained O
inside O
cages O
because O
lions O
understand O
only O
their O
instincts O
. O

Unfortunately O
politics O
is O
a O
breeding O
ground O
for O
human O
monsters O
. O

What O
if O
we O
assumed O
that O
Hezbollah B-NORP
's O
intention O
in O
abducting O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
Israeli B-NORP
soldiers O
was O
in O
response O
to O
the O
Israeli B-NORP
oppression O
that O
we O
all O
see O
? O

Is O
n't O
authority O
or O
power O
a O
responsibility O
? O

What O
I O
want O
to O
say O
is O
that O
someone O
working O
in O
politics O
should O
not O
be O
condemned O
for O
his O
idealism O
and O
slogan O
, O
but O
by O
how O
connected O
he O
is O
to O
reality O
and O
his O
ability O
to O
understand O
it O
, O
and O
thus O
concluding O
what O
the O
consequences O
of O
his O
decisions O
and O
actions O
would O
be O
. O

This O
is O
what O
Hezbollah B-NORP
failed O
to O
do O
. O

Yes O
. O

Without O
doubt O
, O
Israel B-NORP
was O
not O
able O
to O
defeat O
Hezbollah B-NORP
militarily O
, O
and O
it O
suffered O
many O
