`` O
This O

a O

because O

up O

'' O

The O
Journal B-ORG
cited O
the O
state O
's O
revenue O
surplus O
as O
a O
major O
reason O
why O
voters O
never O
warmed O
to O
the O
tax O

hike O
idea O
, O
and O
noted O
that O
it O
did O
n't O
help O
that O
Kaine B-PERSON
was O
trying O
to O
raise O
gasoline O
taxes O
amidst O
soaring O
retail O
prices O
at O
the O

I O
wonder O
how O
the O
Journal B-ORG
would O
interpret O
news O
from O
the B-ORG
Washington I-ORG
Post I-ORG
today O
that O
Del. O
David B-PERSON
B. I-PERSON
Albo I-PERSON
, O
R B-NORP
- O
Springfield B-GPE
and O
a O
number O
of O
other O
GOP B-ORG
delegates O
would O
like O
to O
raise O
an O
estimated O
$ B-MONEY
400 I-MONEY
million I-MONEY
a O
year O
from O
Northern B-LOC
Virginia I-LOC
to O
spend O
on O
local O
road O
and O
rail O
projects O
. O

`` O
Roads O
cost O
money O
, O
'' O
the O
Post B-ORG
quotes O
Albo B-PERSON
as O
saying O
. O

`` O
I O
'd O
love O
to O
find O
a O
way O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
things O
we O
need O

not O
raising O
taxes O
and O
using O
existing O
revenue O
, O

but O
I O
'm O
a O
realist O
. O
'' O

While O
most O
GOP B-NORP
delegates O
were O
willing O
to O
hang O
together O
to O
oppose O
a O
statewide O
tax O
increase O
, O
there O
seems O
to O
be O
little O
appreciation O
of O
the O
root O
causes O
of O
transportation O
dysfunction O
in O
Virginia B-GPE
. O

Oh O
, O
sure O
, O
you O
've O
got O
yer O
Bill B-PERSON
Howell I-PERSON
talking O
about O
tolls O
and O
privatization O
, O

and O
you O
've O
got O
yer O
Tim B-PERSON
Hugo I-PERSON
backing O
telework O
, O

and O
the O
House B-ORG
did O
pass O
some O
marginally O
useful O
legislation O
dealing O
with O
VDOT B-ORG
and O
land O
use O
, O

but O
deep O
down O
inside O
, O
in O
their O
heart O
of O
hearts O
, O
most O
delegates O
share O
the O
assumption O
of O
their O
counterparts O
in O
the B-ORG
state I-ORG
Senate I-ORG
that O
the O
cause O
of O
traffic O
congestion O
is O
insufficient O
transportation O
capacity O
. O

The O
disagreement O
is O
over O
how O
much O
money O
the O
state O
can O
afford O
to O
raise O
to O
pay O
for O
improvements O
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
think O
it O
's O
a O
bit O
too O
early O
for O
anyone O
to O
proclaim O
a O
`` O
victory O
. O
'' O

Yes O
, O
the O
House B-ORG
has O
temporarily O
beat O
back O
proposals O
for O
some B-MONEY
$ I-MONEY
1 I-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
in O
tax O
increases O
. O

But O
simply O
starving O
the O
current O
, O
broken O
transportation O
system O
of O
funds O
is O
n't O
going O
to O
solve O
anything O
. O

The O
House B-ORG
, O
along O
with O
everyone O
else O
, O
needs O
to O
get O
on O
with O
the O
business O
of O
re-thinking O
transportation O
fundamentals O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
they O
'll O
end O
up O
like O
Dave B-PERSON
Albo I-PERSON
, O
promoting O
tax O
increases O
through O
the O
back O
door O
. O

The O
business O
of O
re-thinking O
transportation O
fundamentals O
then O
testing O
, O
validating O
, O
and O
implementing O
the O
results O
of O
all O
that O
thinking O
is O
going O
to O
take O
longer O
and O
cost O
more O
than O
what O
they O
have O
saved O
by O
starving O
the O
current O
system O
of O
funds O
. O

It O
is O
going O
to O
take O
much O
more O
than O
a B-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
in O
tax O
increases O
to O
achieve O
any O
alternative O
plan O
, O
and O
then O
the O
alternative O
may O
turn O
out O
to O
be O
like O
the O
inter-county O
connector O
: O

that O
is O
, O
the O
same O
old O
plan O
only O
50 B-DATE
years I-DATE
later I-DATE
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
we O
still O
suffer O
under O
the O
costs O
of O
the O
congestion O
tax O
, O
for O
which O
we O
get O
nothing O
in O
return O
, O

and O
the O
costs O
of O
any O
action O
, O
whether O
alternative O
or O
traditional O
continues O
to O
go O
up O
. O

In O
the O
end O
we O
are O
going O
to O
be O
coming O
around O
to O
the O
back O
door O
like O
beggars O
, O

but O
the O
alms O
will O
be O
around O
$ B-MONEY
4 I-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
instead O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
. O

Yeah O
, O
I O
'd O
say O
it O
was O
too O
early O
to O
claim O
victory O

that O

'' O
is O
challenged O
by O
the O
Post B-ORG
report O
on O
the O
view O
of O
the O
leaders O
in O
the O
Senate B-ORG

They O
say O
the O
state O

less O
populated O
regions O
are O
also O
in O
desperate O
need O
of O
better O
roads O
to O
draw O
jobs O
and O
reverse O
economic O
decline O

Until O
our O
leaders O
recognize O
that O
the O
role O
of O
transportation O
is O
limited O
to O
being O
economic O
enabler O
, O
and O
not O
an O
economic O
driver O
we O
will O
be O
locked O
in O
to O
the O
current O

stalemate O
. O

Spending O
taxpayer O
dollars O
on O
transportation O
to O
`` O
draw O
jobs O
and O
reverse O
economic O
decline O
'' O
is O
like O
pushing O
on O
a O
rope O
. O

Reducing O
the O
costs O
of O
the O
congestion O
tax O
is O
the O
only O
way O
to O
advance O
the O
Virginia B-GPE
's O
economy O
. O

And O
yet O
90 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
the O
state O

roads O
are O
uncongested O
90 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
the O

and O
45 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
all O
travel O
happens O
on O
and O
during O
the O
other O
10 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
. O

How O
hard O
is O
this O
to O
figure O
out O
, O
really O
? O

Traffic O
congestion O
is O
less O
during O
recessions O
, O
and O
some O
cities O
would O
willingly O
trade O
high O
unemployment O
rates O
for O
congestion O
. O

Traffic O
congestion O
becomes O
self O
- O
correcting O
when O
businesses O
choose O
to O
leave O
an O
area O
because O
it O
is O
too O
crowded O
and O
plagued O
by O
delays O
. O

Politicians O
want O
the O
growth O
that O
brings O
congestion O
, O
yet O
they O
also O
want O
to O
control O
or O
reduce O
that O
congestion O
. O

They O
refuse O
to O
implement O
effective O
strategies O
to O
relieve O
congestion O
because O
the O
stringent O
solutions O
required O
might O
, O
like O
congestion O
itself O
, O
redirect O
growth O
to O
other O
areas O
. O

This O
is O
not O
a O
new O
problem O
. O

Rome B-GPE
restricted O
deliveries O
to O
night O
time O
because O
the O
carts O
made O
the O
streets O
dangerous O
, O
but O
night O
deliveries O
interrupted O
sleep O
. O

London B-GPE
had O
parking O
restrictions O
in O
the O
1600's B-DATE
. O

Affordable O
public O
transportation O
was O
developed O
to O
ease O
the O
overcrowding O
and O
polllution O
that O
prevailed O
before O
. O

Zoning O
was O
developed O
in O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
to O
encourage O
people O
to O
move O
out O
of O
the O
city O
center O
, O
subsidized O
by O
flat O
fares O
on O
the O
trolleys O
. O

Later O
, O
trolley O
tracks O
became O
jammed O
with O
trolleys O
and O
the O
system O
became O
overcrowded O
. O

When O
roads O
began O
to O
take O
over O
from O
railroads O
, O
the O
problem O
soon O
became O
obvious O
: O

`` O
None O
of O
us O
should O
delude O
ourselves O
, O
however O
, O
that O
the O
road O
problem O
of O
Virginia B-GPE
... O
will O
be O
solved O
at O
least O
for O
many B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

Those O
who O
use O
the O
roads O
will O
demand O
wider O
, O
smoother O
and O
safer O
roads O
due O
to O
their O
increasing O
use O
and O
the O
consequent O
congestion O
on O

Whether O
you O
call O
Smart O
Growth O

Transit O
oriented O
design O
, O
New O
Urbanism O
, O

Oriented O
Communities O
or O
what O
have O
you O
, O
the O
end O
result O
of O
higher O
densities O
will O
be O
more O
congestion O
in O
more O
localized O
places O
. O

We O
might O
be O
able O
to O
alleviate O
some O
of O
that O
by O
creating O
a O
transit O
system O
that O
is O
20 B-CARDINAL
times O
as O
dense O
as O
we O
have O
, O

but O
I O
doubt O
we O
have O
the O
economic O
stomach O
for O
that O
, O
either O
, O
particularly O
since O
that O
style O
of O
living O
is O
likely O
to O
attract O
only O
15 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
the O
population O

Planners O
and O
environmentalists O
are O
disingenuous O
when O
they O
urge O
us O
to O
fight O
congestion O
through O
smart O
growth O
. O

Politicians O
at O
heart O
, O
they O
really O
want O
more O
congested O
environments O
-LRB- O
for O
everyone O
else O
-RRB- O
but O
presumably O
want O
that O
congestion O
to O
be O
somehow O
managed O
and O
accommodated O
. O

If O
it O
is O
not O
accommodated O
, O
people O
will O
start O
to O
move O
to O
the O
suburbs O
specifically O
to O
avoid O
congestion O
. O

As O
George B-PERSON
will O
put O
it O
, O
`` O
The O
purpose O
of O

to O
prevent O

from O

And O
the O
bland O

is O
the O

under O

, O
it O

not O

need O

It O
is O
OK O
so O

as O

goes O

but O
the O

What O
it O
leaves O
out O
is O
what O
happens O
to O
everybody O
else O
, O
who O
happens O
not O
to O
be O
in O
an O
area O
designated O
for O

friendly O
development O
. O

Are O
you O
also O
willing O
to O
also O
reform O
counterproductive O
zoning O
codes O
that O
requires O
people O
to O
stay O
in O
the O
business O
of O
farming O
, O
for O
example O
? O

If O
more O
density O
is O
good O
for O
some O
areas O
, O
why O
not O
all O
? O

I O
know O
your O
answer O
will O
be O
that O
those O
people O
should O
be O
allowed O
to O
live O
where O
they O
please O
as O
long O
as O
they O
pay O
their O
full O
locational O
costs O
. O

But O
we O
can O
already O
see O
that O
those O
costs O
are O
subject O
to O
maipulation O
: O

people O
whose O
costs O
include O
supporting O
the B-FAC
Dulles I-FAC
Toll I-FAC
road I-FAC
are O
also O
supporting O
the O
transit O
that O
will O
make O
it O
possible O
for O
future O
residents O
to O
live O
in O
transit O
friendly O
neighborhoods O
. O

Whatever O
happened O
to O
THEM O
paying O
their O
full O
locational O
costs O
? O

Transit O
is O
going O
to O
require O
massive O
and O
widespread O
subsidies O
to O
even O
partially O
work O
. O

Here O
, O
again O
, O
some O
allowance O
needs O
to O
be O
made O
for O
the O
idea O
that O
transit O
provides O
some O
limited O
benefit O
to O
non-users O
. O

So O
, O
those O
people O
who O
are O
left O
out O
will O
be O
expected O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
transit O
that O
helps O
make O
those O
included O
in O
development O
areas O
possible O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
they O
will O
likely O
be O
excluded O
from O
increasing O
density O
even O
when O
it O
is O
to O
their O
benefit O
-LRB- O
they O
may O
live O
next O
to O
those B-PERCENT
90 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
roads O
that O
are O
underutilized O
-RRB- O
. O

This O
will O
be O
done O
partially O
in O
order O
to O
artificially O
create O
the O
demand O
required O
to O
fill O
the O
designated O
areas O
, O
and O
the O
cover O
story O
will O
be O
that O
it O
is O
for O
the O
environment O
, O
to O
save O
prime O
farmland O
, O
etc. O

This O
amounts O
to O
disingenuously O
making O
certain O
preferences O
and O
prophesies O
mandatory O
, O

and O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
will O
fly O
. O

When O
Virginia B-GPE
does O
systematically O
explore O
these O
ideas O
they O
may O
very O
well O
come O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
Fundamental O
Change O
is O
a O
really O
lousy O
idea O
, O
and O
that O
, O
bad O
as O
it O
is O
, O
business O
as O
usual O
is O
the O
best O
option O
after O
all O
. O

The O
main O
reson O
they O
are O
likely O
to O
reach O
that O
conclusion O
is O
that O
the O
costs O
for O
all O
this O
theoretical O
thinking O
and O
experimental O
development O
is O
going O
to O
be O
far O
higher O
than O
the O
money O
we O
`` O
saved O
'' O
on O
transportation O
by O
not O
providing O
it O
. O

I O
see O
what O
TMT B-PERSON
says O
as O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
same O
coin O
I O
described O
above O
. O

If O
we O
get O
APF's O
they O
will O
be O
disproportionately O
used O
against O
those O
who O
are O
`` O
left O
out O
'' O
of O
development O
plans O
, O
and O
consequently O
used O
to O
ram O
still O
more O
development O
down O
TMT B-PERSON
's O
throat O
. O

After O
all O
, O
they O
will O
say O
, O
that O
is O
where O
the O
most O
facilities O
are O
; O

even O
if O
they O
are O
inadequate O
, O
they O
are O
more O
adequate O
than O
places O
that O
have O
none O
. O

Will B-PERSON
Rogers I-PERSON
once O
joked O
that O
if O
you O
wanted O
to O
cure O
traffic O
congestion O
, O
just O
make O
people O
pay O
cash O
for O
their O
cars O
up O
front O
. O

The O
APF O
idea O
is O
the O
same O
kind O
of O
joke O
. O

None O
of O
the O
development O
we O
have O
was O
built O
when O
the O
facilities O
were O
adequate O
, O
and O
much O
of O
it O
was O
built O
specifically O
to O
get O
away O
from O
places O
that O
had O
inadequate O
facilities O
and O
were O
over O
built O
. O

We O
are O
not O
going O
to O
pay O
for O
APF's O
up O
front O
, O
so O
it O
is O
a O
recipe O
for O
creating O
either O
no O
development O
or O
only O
hoplessly O
expensive O
development O

-LRB- O
See O
Morgan O
's O
Riflemen O
-RRB- O
. O

APF's O
are O
a O
good O
idea O
only O
if O
you O
are O
willing O
to O
provide O
a O
dedicated O
and O
adequate O
funding O
stream O
for O
them O
, O
same O
as O
for O
Metro B-FAC
. O

And O
that O
means O
you O
need O
a O
lot O
more O
money O
. O

And O
it O
is O
no O
good O
to O
claim O
that O
it O
has O
to O
be O
done O
without O
impacting O
current O
residents O
. O

It O
is O
still O
going O
to O
come O
out O
of O
your O
pocket O
in O
the O
end O
. O

Just O
as O
roads O
benefit O
those O
who O
do O
n't O
drive O
and O
transit O
benefits O
those O
that O
do O
n't O
ride O
, O
development O
benefits O
those O
that O
do O
n't O
build O
. O

This O
last B-ORDINAL
creates O
a O
real O
problem O
and O
hardship O
because O
existing O
residents O
have O
no O
way O
to O
capitalize O
on O
their O
fortune O
unless O
they O
move O
. O

But O
if O
the O
APF's O
are O
disproportionately O
applied O
, O
then O
there O
wo O
n't O
be O
any O
place O
to O
move O
to O
. O

In O
that O
case O
the O
benefits O
and O
disbenefits O
of O
APF's O
cancel O
each O
other O
out O
, O

and O
there O
is O
no O
reason O
to O
implement O
what O
is O
a O
lousy O
idea O
to O
begin O
with O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
have O

access O
to O

but O
did O
it O
really O
refer O

also O

If O
so O
, O
does O
the O

have O
a O

Once O
we O

we O
can O
move O

the O

indeed O
to O

anything O

In O
that O

, O
the O
WSJ B-ORG
got O
its O
information O
very O
wrong O
. O

Yesterday B-DATE
as O
I O

still O
65 B-CARDINAL

a O

was O
running O
at O

75 B-CARDINAL
and O
maybe O
more O
. O

He O
was O
towing O
a O

. O

That O
kind O
of O
behavior O
makes O
you O
think O
there O
might O
be O
some O
value O
in O
Albo B-PERSON
's O
plan O
to O
increase O
fines O
for O
really O

, O
especially O
since O
almost B-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL
third I-CARDINAL
of O

cogestion O
is O
caused O
by O

. O

I O
have O
long O
held O
that O
fines O
for O
professional O

should O
be O
tripled O
- O

these O

should O
know O
better O
. O

Jim B-PERSON
, O
I O
agree O
with O
most O
of O
your O
proposals O
, O
or O
at O
least O
the O
goals O
you O
hope O
to O
achieve O
with O
them O
. O

But O
I O
am O
suspicious O
of O
the O
outsourcing O
and O
private O
partnerships O
. O

I O
'd O
rather O
reform O
public O
entities O
because O
private O
entities O
require O
a O
level O
of O
cost O
public O
ones O
should O
n't O
-- O
profit O
. O

I O
agree O
with O
Ray B-PERSON
that O
even O
non-users O
of O
transportation O
facilities O
benefit O
from O
them O
, O
but O
I O
do O
favor O
higher O
gas O
taxes O
and O
other O
directly O
related O
user O
fees O
. O

And O
with O
congestion O
the O
way O
it O
is O
, O
building O
roads O
to O
nowhere O
in O
the O
hopes O
of O
fostering O
economic O
development O
may O
not O
be O
feasible O
. O

Ray B-PERSON
, O
I O
'm O
surprised O
you O
think O
we O
ca O
n't O
do O
more O
teleworking O
. O

Seems O
we O
have O
many O
opportunities O
to O
expand O
it O
. O

But O
overall O
, O
demanding O
such O
reforms O
before O
expanding O
capacity O
simply O
wo O
n't O
work O
in O
the O
real O
world O
. O

First O
, O
we O
'll O
need O
to O
reform O
American B-NORP
capitalism O
itself O
, O
eliminating O
the O
public O
supported O
breaks O
we O
give O
to O
business O
, O
whether O
they O
be O
home O
developers O
, O
road O
builders O
, O
or O
farmers O
, O
as O
well O
as O
homeowners O
, O
i.e. O
, O
interest O
rate O
deductions O
. O

Bottom O
line O
is O
we O
need O
more O
capacity O
and O
land O
use O
reform O
. O

My O
interest O
is O
the O
politics O
of O
it O
. O

Which O
brings O
me O
back O
to O
the O
same O
question O
, O
asked O
in O
that O
context O
: O

How O
do O
you O
judge O
when O
the O
reforms O
you O
want O
are O
sufficient O
to O
invest O
more O
in O
increasing O
capacity O
? O

Jim B-PERSON
, O
you O
may O
have O
a O
clear O
vision O
in O
your O
head O
about O
what O
that O
threshold O
is O
, O

but O
I O
sense O
from O
the O
SmartGrowth O
folks O
and O
anti-taxers O
who O
make O
many O
of O
the O
same O
arguements O
you O
do O
that O
any O
amount O
of O
reform O
will O
never O
be O
enough O
. O

I O
think O
EMR B-PERSON
convinced O
me O
that O
those O
that O
really O
can O
telework O
already O
do O
so O
. O

There O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
for O
whom O
it O
does O
not O
apply O
, O
retail O
, O
mechanics O
, O
etc. O

There O
is O
more O
we O
can O
do O
on O
telework O
, O

but O
Ed B-PERSON
suggests O
the O
well O
is O
not O
as O
deep O
as O
we O
would O
like O
to O
believe O
. O

Then O
again O
, O
it O
runs O
counter O
or O
provides O
impetus O
that O
is O
counter O
to O
his O
other O
ideas O
. O

I O
was O
formerly O
more O
optimistic O
, O

but O
in O
this O
case O
I O
found O
his O
argument O
persuasive O
. O

I O
'm O
open O
to O
more O
hard O
data O
, O
and O
I O
believe O
the O
biggest O
hindrance O
is O
organizational O
, O
not O
technical O
. O

I O
favor O
higher O
gas O
taxes O
and O
user O
fees O
, O
too O
, O
but O
not O
exclusively O
because O
we O
all O
have O
a O
stake O
in O
roads O
. O

I O
would O
make O
the O
same O
argument O
for O
transit O
: O

it O
is O
OK O
for O
the O
general O
public O
or O
auto O
drivers O
-LRB- O
which O
is O
much O
the O
same O
thing O
-RRB- O

benefit O
to O
everyone O
for O
those O
that O
are O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
once O
we O
understand O
how O
small O
that O
benefit O
really O
is O
we O
might O
decide O
it O
's O
just O
not O
worth O
it O
, O

and O
we O
should O
let O
the O
thing O
be O
privatized O
where O
it O
works O
and O
disappear O
where O
it O
does O
n't O
. O

I O
'm O
with O
you O

We O
can O
not O
take O
hard O
lines O
on O
every O
issue O
and O
make O
progress O
in O
any O
direction O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
for O
some O
, O
strategic O
stalemate O
is O
just O
as O
good O
as O
any O
other O

of O

never O

whatever O
other O
harm O
it O
does O

Such O
events O
are O
becoming O
more O
frequent O
and O
more O
convenient O
to O
more O
Virginia B-GPE
residents O
, O
although O
based O
on O
cod O
's O
comment O
, O
we O
still O
have O
a O
ways O
to O
go O
. O

A O
well O
- O
used O
economic O
development O
tool O
is O
the O
incubator O
, O
typically O
an O
office O
building O
that O
is O
subdivided O
and O
provides O
subsidized O
rent O
and O
admin O
services O
to O
small O
business O
that O
have O
outgrown O
their O
garage O
or O
bedroom O
, O
but O
are O
too O
small O
for O
leased O
space O
. O

These O
incubators O
typically O
cater O
to O
high O
tech O
or O
`` O
clean O
'' O
service O
businesses O
. O

I O
have O
always O
thought O
we O
should O
consider O
setting O
up O
recycling O
`` O
incubators O
'' O
at O
landfills O
and O
transfer O
stations O
. O

E-waste O
and O
construction O
waste O
are O
two B-CARDINAL
potentially O
profitable O
steams O

and O
nurturing O
small O
recycling O
businesses O
might O
serve O
both O
an O
economic O
development O
good O
and O
a O
public O
good O
. O

A O
person O
with O
a O
pick O
- O
up O
truck O
could O
start O
such O
a O
business O
pretty O
easily O
. O

The O
cost O
of O
a O
trailer O
or O
two B-CARDINAL
and O
a O
covered O
space O
would O
probably O
be O
much O
less O
than O
equivalent O
office O
space O
. O

If O
we O
stimulated O
home O
- O
grown O
markets O
, O
we O
might O
not O
send O
so O
much O
to O
China B-GPE
, O
although O
I O
suppose O
anything O
we O
can O
do O
to O
curb O
the O
trade O
deficit O
might O
be O
considered O
a O
good O
thing O
in O
some O
quarters O
. O

That O
's O
right O
. O

I O
know O
a O
guy O
who O
gets O
surplus O
building O
materials O
sorts O
and O
resells O
it O
. O

I O
've O
bought O
quite O
a O
bit O
from O
him O

and O
he O
apparently O
does O
a O
good O
business O
. O

The O
business O
itself O
is O
somewhat O
trashy O
looking O
. O

It O
appears O
that O
it O
is O
located O
on O
part O
of O
an O
old O
family O
farm O
, O

and O
the O
nearby O
houses O
are O
ones O
that O
have O
been O
spun O
off O
to O
family O
memebers O
. O

But O
if O
anybody O
else O
tried O
to O
duplicate O
it O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
think O
of O
anyplace O
in O
my O
county O
where O
it O
would O
be O
allowed O
, O
or O
else O
the O
requirements O
would O
be O
so O
onerous O
it O
could O
n't O
survive O
. O

In O
my O
home O
town O
, O
they O
once O
built O
an O
entire O
tanker O
truck O
for O
the O
fire O
department O
, O
out O
of O
stuff O
that O
came O
from O
the O
dump O
. O

We O
had O
really O
low O
taxes O
. O

The O
dump O
had O
well O
organized O
recycling O
areas O
located O
around O
the O
central O
landfill O
pit O
, O

and O
people O
had O
a O
good O
eye O
for O
things O
that O
others O
might O
want O
. O

Recycling O
is O
a O
really O
good O
idea O
, O

but O
it O
is O
hard O
to O
make O
it O
pay O
, O

and O
it O
has O
a O
waste O
stream O
of O
its O
own O
. O

What O
we O
need O
to O
do O
is O
to O
move O
the O
recycling O
process O
forward O
into O
the O
repair O
world O
. O

The O
Volkswagen B-ORG
Beetle B-PRODUCT
was O
a O
terrible O
car O
, O

but O
it O
was O
eminently O
recyclable O
. O

I O
had O
one B-CARDINAL
for O
almost B-DATE
twenty I-DATE
years I-DATE

and O
at O
the O
end O
there O
was O
n't O
a O
single O
part O
that O
was O
original O
. O

The O
entire O
body O
had O
been O
swapped O
out O
, O
the O
machinery O
several O
times O
, O
and O
the O
running O
gear O
many O
times O
. O

It O
was O
still O
running O
when O
I O
sold O
it O
, O

but O
if O
VDOT B-ORG
ever O
checked O
the O
serial O
numbers O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
would O
happen O
. O

The O
other O
thing O
we O
need O
to O
do O
is O
expand O
the O
deposit O
idea O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
having O
deposits O
on O
soft O
drink O
bottles O
, O
we O
should O
have O
them O
on O
appliances O
, O
autos O
and O
other O
big O
ticket O
items O
where O
they O
can O
do O
some O
good O
. O

The O
deposit O
would O
flow O
to O
the O
recycler O
who O
is O
the O
final O
user O
: O

this O
would O
make O
recycling O
profitable O
. O

He O
would O
claim O
the O
refund O
from O
the O
manufacturer O
. O

This O
would O
ensure O
that O
the O
user O
of O
a O
product O
pays O
for O
its O
disposal O
, O

and O
manufacturers O
would O
have O
an O
incentive O
to O
keep O
the O
deposit O
money O
as O
long O
as O
possible O
by O
building O
items O
that O
can O
be O
repaired O
rather O
than O
disposed O
of O
. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
foreign O
manufacturers O
, O
the O
recycling O
fee O
would O
haqve O
a O
similar O
effect O
as O
an O
import O
duty O
and O
could O
be O
collected O
in O
the O
same O
way O
, O
but O
without O
being O
called O
a O
tariff O
. O

Why O
do O
some O
localities O
charge O
for O
the O
service O
while O
others O
do O
n't O
? O

Just O
curious O
. O

Because O
, O
for O
the O
most O
part O
, O
it O
is O
a O
money O
losing O
operation O
, O
or O
at O
most O
marginal O
. O

Recall O
the O
story O
of O
mandatory O
newspaper O
recycling O
in O
the O
District B-GPE
. O

As O
a O
political O
city O
, O
they O
created O
so O
much O
waste O
product O
they O
flooded O
the O
market O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
look O
down O
the O
road O
, O
think O
about O
what O
is O
going O
to O
happen O
after O
we O
spend O
a B-CARDINAL
few I-CARDINAL
billion I-CARDINAL
to O
meet O
the O
Chesapeake B-LOC
Bay I-LOC
waste O
water O
restrictions O
. O

Where O
are O
we O
going O
to O
put O
all O
the O
sludge O
that O
results O
? O

Once O
we O
stop O
putting O
it O
in O
the O
Bay B-LOC
, O
we O
are O
going O
to O
have O
to O
put O
it O
on O
the O
land O
. O

Then O
we O
will O
have O
regulations O
to O
prevent O
sludge O
runoff O
in O
order O
that O
we O
do O
n't O
pay O
for O
the O
same O
sludge O
creation O
multiple O
times O
. O

Eventually O
we O
will O
outlaw O
gravity O
so O
that O
sludge O
is O
prohibited O
from O
running O
downhill O
. O

Coming O
soon O
to O
a O
farm O
near O
you O
: O
two B-DATE

As O
an O
engineer O
and O
a O
flinty O
New B-NORP
Englander I-NORP
, O
and O
a O
farmer O
, O
I O
spend O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
fixing O
old O
junk O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
stand O
throwing O
something O
away O
. O

Maybe O
some O
of O
it O
comes O
from O
growing O
up O
on O
an O
island O
where O
there O
was O
no O
place O
to O
throw O
it O
. O

My O
father O
used O
to O
say O
that O
garbage O
was O
like O
scotch O
tape O

you O
can O
only O
stick O

'' O

When O
I O
'm O
repairing O
something O
that O
was O
designed O
so O
it O
ca O
n't O
be O
fixed O
, O
it O
makes O
me O
crazy O

I O
want O
to O
go O
find O
some O
enginner O
and O
marketing O
guy O
an O
knock O
heads O
together O

Here O
are O
a O
few O
examples O
. O

A O
rototiller O
with O
gears O
made O
out O
of O
free O
machining O
brass O
. O

Guaranteed O
to O
fail O
. O

A O
windshiel O
wiper O
motor O
installed O
in O
a O
totally O
inaccessible O
place O
under O

It O
was O

When O
the O

rotted O
away O
, O
the O

fell O
on O
the O
floor O
, O
followed O
by O
a O
torrent O
of O
rain O
that O
shorted O
out O
everything O
under O
the O

A O
1/4 B-QUANTITY

you O

Every O

What O
's O
worse O
is O
, O
that O
because O
I O
'm O
good O
at O
this O
, O
people O
think O
I O
like O
it O

Wrong O
. O

I O
hate O
things O

and O
I O
love O
flesh O
. O

I O
'm O
convinced O
that O
things O
are O
inhabited O
with O
Gremlins O
. O

It O
's O
a O
vicious O
circle O
. O

The O
more O
stuff O
you O
have O
the O
more O
stuff O
you O
need O
to O
maintain O
it O
, O
like O
the O
Virginia B-GPE

It O
starts O
with O

next O
thing O
you O

My O
wife O
takes O
great O
glee O
in O
making O
fun O
of O
all O
of O
this O

Then O
I O
pointed O
out O
all O
he O
special O
purpose O
tools O
in O
her O
kithchen O
, O

and O
that O
is O
just O
for O
one B-CARDINAL
job O
. O

She O
carefuly O
forgets O
all O
that O
when O
she O
needs O
something O
and O
it O
turns O
out O
that O
I O
have O
just O
the O
right O
framitz O
to O
manufacture O
a O
repair O
piece O
for O
her O
thing O
- O
a O
- O
bob O
. O

I O
'm O
convinced O
that O
we O
could O
solve O
our O
balance O
of O
payments O
deficits O
if O
we O
just O
passed O
must O
be O
repairable O
laws O
. O

Every O
engineer O
should O
be O
required O
to O
be O
a O
mechanic O
for O
ten B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

For O
many O
of O
us O
our O
life O
has O
come O
down O
to O
buy O
it O
at O
Wal B-ORG

mart I-ORG
and O
take O
it O
to O
the O

Even O
if O
you O
buy O
it O
at O
the O
BMW B-ORG
or O
John B-ORG

dealer O
it O
is O
no O
different O
. O

So O
, O
if O
PEC B-ORG
wants O
to O
make O
a O
supporter O
out O
of O
me O
, O
the O
way O
to O
do O
it O
is O
to O
start O
a O
campaign O
that O
ensures O
things O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
be O
thrown O

, O
not O

I O
'm O
normally O
a O

on O
the O
principle O

all O

But O
I O
'm O
also O
wary O
of O
the O
potential O
for O

upgraded O

act O
as O

-- O
a O
pattern O
of O
development O
that O
would O
negate O
many O
of O
the O
benefits O
of O

. O

If O
the O
Kaine B-PERSON
administration O
wants O
to O
align O
transportation O
and O
land O
use O
planning O
, O
a O
good O
place O
to O
start O
would O
be O
with O
projects O
, O
like O
this O
one O
, O
that O
emanate O
from O
the O
administration O
itself O
. O

Any O
evaluation O
of O
the O
competing O
proposals O
needs O
to O
consider O
the O
impact O
not O
just O
on O
traffic O
counts O
and O
toll O
financing O
but O
local O
human O
settlement O
patterns O
. O

The O
`` O
good O
'' O
part O
about O
private O
investor O
toll O
roads O
is O
that O
real O
money O
is O
riding O
on O
the O
`` O
demand O
'' O
calculation O
and O
when O
real O
money O
is O
involved O
, O
less O
likely O
that O
the O
predicted O
demand O
data O
will O
be O
`` O
cooked O
'' O
to O
justify O
the O
road O
. O

The O
`` O
bad O
'' O
part O
is O
that O
VDOT B-ORG
is O
still O
involved O
and O
I O
'm O
sure O
will O
find O
new O
ways O
to O
screw O
things O
up O
. O

The O
`` O
ugly O
'' O
needs O
some O
explanation O

and O
I O
'll O
use O
the B-ORG
History I-ORG
Channel I-ORG
's I-ORG
show O
on O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
national O
railroad O
. O

Pointed O
out O
in O
that O
program O
that O
the O
`` O
incentives O
'' O
for O
attracting O
private O
investment O
to O
build O
the O
rail O
was O
`` O
free O
land O
'' O
to O
those O
who O
built O
the O
rail O
. O

So O
take O
a O
private O
investor O
.. O
any O
private O
investor O
who O
`` O
proposes O
'' O
to O
build O
a O
major O
road O
- O
like O
460 B-FAC
- O
and O
folks O
will O
fall O
all O
over O
themselves O
about O
their O
good O
fortune O
... O

but O
consider O
... O
if O
those O
same O
investors O
- O
at O
the O
same O
time O
they O
were O
building O
the O
road O
- O
were O
also O
buying O
up O
land O
to O
develop O
- O
that O
would O
be O
more O
easily O
developable O
because O
of O
the O
new O
road O
? O

Now O
.. O
the O
investors O
.. O
I O
'm O
quite O
sure O
would O
be O
saying O
the O
same O
words O
that O
we O
hear O
now O
days O
... O

that O
they O
are O
ONLY O
responding O
to O
a O
demand O
.. O
they O
did O
not O
create O
it O
. O
:--RRB- O

other O
views O
? O

So O
your O
point O
is O
that O
if O
private O
money O
is O
developing O
the O
roads O
and O
private O
money O
is O
developing O
the O
land O
then O
government O
loses O
control O
over O
the O
plan O
. O

Furthermore O
the O
infrastructure O
is O
privately O
owned O
so O
they O
can O
gouge O
all O
they O
want O
. O

Sounds O
like O
a O
plan O
. O

All O
we O
need O
is O
enough O
speculators O
to O
make O
it O
work O
. O

Ray B-PERSON
, O
your O
explanation O
sounds O
good O
to O
me O
. O

Developing O
US B-FAC
460 I-FAC
and O
linking O
it O
to O
a O
rail O
and O
road O
crossing O
from O
the B-FAC
Port I-FAC
of I-FAC
Norfolk I-FAC
is O
the O
way O
to O
take O
traffic O
off O
I O
on O
The O
Peninsula B-LOC
. O

One O
would O
hope O
that O
some O
kind O
of O
safeguards O
have O
been O
put O
into O
the B-LAW
Va I-LAW
Public I-LAW
- I-LAW
Private I-LAW
Law I-LAW
to O
deal O
with O
this O
potential O
. O

Overall O
, O
I O
am O
a O
supporter O
of O
private O
investor O
toll O
roads O
- O
PROVIDED O
they O
utilize O
ORT O
- O
open O
road O
-LRB- O
electronic O
-RRB- O
tolling O
so O
that O
only O
those O
who O
refuse O
to O
obtain O
transponders O
have O
to O
stop O
at O
toll O
plazas O
. O

The O
comment O
on O
rail O
is O
interesting O
because O
some O
of O
the O
opponents O
of O
expanding O
I O
would O
like O
to O
see O
parallel O
rail O
facilities O
so O
that O
the O
scope O
and O
scale O
of O
improving O
of O
I O
might O
be O
more O
modest O
. O

So O
.. O
connecting O
the O
dots O
.. O
Rail O
on O
I O
that O
connects O
to O
rail O
on O
I O
... O
:--RRB- O

Here O
's O
some O
further O
thoughts O
for O
whatever O
they O
might O
be O
worth O
.. O
or O
not O
. O

Let O
's O
start O
with O
the O
premise O
that O
increased O
population O
and O
new O
jobs O
means O
more O
people O
who O
need O
a O
place O
to O
live O
. O

Let O
's O
further O
specify O
that O
many O
folks O
who O
accept O
the O
population O
- O
growth O
realities O
are O
still O
, O
none O
- O
the O
- O
less O
not O
happy O
with O
the O
settlement O
patterns O
that O
result O
from O
free O
- O
market O
responses O
to O
the O
housing O
demand O
. O

Let O
's O
finally O
specify O
that O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
major O
agnsts O
with O
regard O
to O
folks O
' O
views O
with O
respect O
to O
settlement O
patterns O
- O
is O
the O
impacts O
on O
the O
transportation O
network O
- O
in O
the O
form O
of O
increased O
traffic O
and O
congestion O
on O
roads O
not O
designed O
to O
handle O
such O
increased O
volumes O
AND O
no O
money O
available O
to O
upgrade O
them O
anytime O
soon O
. O

So O
... O
enter O
a O
private O
investor O
who O
agrees O
to O
build O
not O
only O
a O
TOLL O
road O
, O
but O
develop O
land O
to O
serve O
the O
housing O
demand O
- O
AND O
... O
what O
he O
-LRB- O
she O
-RRB- O
develops O
IS O
.. O
in O
fact O
, O
New O
Urban O
, O
compact O
developments O
. O

So O
, O
in O
doing O
so O
- O
the O
developer O
solves O
three B-CARDINAL
problems O
: O

1 B-CARDINAL
. O
- O
provides O
needed O
new O
housing O

2 B-CARDINAL
. O
- O
provides O
efficient O
compact O
development O
that O
includes O
bike O
and O
ped O
and O
mixed O
- O
use O
format O
. O

3 B-CARDINAL
. O
- O
provides O
the O
road O
capacity O
to O
serve O
the O
new O
developments O
-LRB- O
via O
a O
new O
toll O
road O
-RRB- O
. O

... O
Why O
would O
such O
a O
thing O
be O
a O
bad O
thing O
? O

is O

I O
always O

the O
ticket O

I O
was O

re O
: O
new O
rail O
/ O
private O
investors O

I O
've O
always O
wondered O
WHY O
private O
rail O
can O
not O
compete O
with O
public O
roads O
for O
the O
transportation O
of O
goods O
. O

I O
've O
heard O
LOTs O
of O
explanations O
.. O
but O
du O
n O
no O
that O
I O
've O
ever O
seen O
a O
clear O
analysis O
. O

For O
that O
matter O
.. O
I O
've O
never O
seen O
a O
comparison O
betwen O
what O
the O
costs O
are O
for O
one B-QUANTITY
mile I-QUANTITY
of O

vs O
one B-QUANTITY
mile I-QUANTITY
of O
18 B-CARDINAL
- O

- O
capable O

right O
- O
of O

.. O
much O
less O
the O
comparative O
operating O
costs O
between O
a O
load O
of O
goods O
transported O
by O
rail O
vs O
road O
. O

But O
my O
point O
is O
... O
rails O
wo O
n't O
be O
used O
instead O
of O
roads O
unless O
/ O
until O
they O
are O
superior O
in O
terms O
of O

and O
effectiveness O
-LRB- O
movement O
of O

from O

-RRB- O

I O
can O
see O
where O
.. O
at O
some O
point O
goods O
MUST O
travel O
by O
truck O
because O
rail O
simply O
can O
not O
go O
everywhere O
that O
our O
road O
network O
does O

but O
when O
we O
still O
transfer O
goods O
across O
the O
country O
- O
by O
truck O
.. O
verses O
rail O
.. O
the O
obvious O
question O
is O
why O
? O

And O
my O
ignorance O
... O
leaves O
me O
with O
`` O
well O
, O
presumedly O
, O
the O
company O
that O
needed O
the O
goods O
shipped O
would O
not O
have O
chosen O
the O
more O
expensive O
method O
'' O
. O

... O
and O
if O
it O
is O
cheaper O
to O
move O
goods O
across O
the O

by O
truck O
.. O
then O
why O
would O
we O
expect O
moving O
goods O
across O
Virginia B-GPE
to O
be O
any O
cheaper O
? O

.... O
all O
things O
being O
equal O
... O
which O
I O
doubt O
seriously O
is O
the O
case O
. O

Lost O
in O
the O
hyperbole O
coming O
from O
Hampton B-LOC
Roads I-LOC
about O
`` O

'' O
being O
the O
only O
way O
to O
save O
our O
so O

called O
`` O

'' O
is O
any O

about O
`` O

'' O
. O

Toll O

are O
4 B-CARDINAL
times O
more O
costly O
to O
run O
, O
than O
by O
using O
the O

. O

And O
in O
fact O
in O
Virginia B-GPE
it O
will O
cost O
even O
more O
as O
there O
is O
no O
big O

the O

The O

typically O
have O
no O
knowlege O
of O
how O

it O

to O
both O

The O
sensible O

logical O

with O

only O
crisis O
in O

have O
in O

is O
a O
loss O
of O

in O
both O
VDOT B-ORG

the O

I O
'm O
with O
Pat B-PERSON
. O

Tolls O
are O
a O
lousy O
idea O
. O

They O
are O
a O
cheap O
shot O
way O
for O
the O
legislators O
to O
push O
their O
fialurs O
off O
on O
the O
faceless O
foreign O
businesses O
, O
and O
they O
are O
supported O
by O
people O
who O
think O
the O
tolls O
wo O
n't O
affect O
them O
. O

If O
this O
catches O
on O
, O
we O
will O
live O
to O
regret O
the O
day O
. O

We O
have O
tried O
private O
tolls O
before O
, O
and O
they O
did O
n't O
work O

As O

forget O
it O
unless O
your O

so O

in O
the O

The O

has O
less O
to O
do O
with O
the O

The O
question O
was O
innocent O
enough O
. O

`` O
What O
's O
going O
on O
with O
contemporary O
art O
these O
days O
? O
'' O

My O
answer O
was O
equally O
candid O
. O

`` O
Beats O
me O
. O
'' O

I O
do O
spend O
a O
sizable O
chunk O
of O
my O
time O
looking O
at O
, O
reading O
about O
and O
thinking O
over O
new O
art O
in O
Los B-GPE
Angeles I-GPE
and O
elsewhere O
, O

but O
the O
days O
when O
a O
succinct O
response O
might O
quickly O
sum O
up O
the O
art O
scene O
are O
long O
gone O
. O

Partly O
that O
's O
because O
contemporary O
art O
has O
gone O
global O
. O

The O
decade O
of O
the O
1980s B-DATE
was O
a O
pivot O
, O
when O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
's I-GPE
postwar O
role O
as O
serious O
art O
's O
only O
serious O
city O
came O
to O
an O
end O
. O

Mostly O
, O
though O
, O
it O
's O
because O
art O
, O
wherever O
it O
is O
made O
, O
no O
longer O
subscribes O
to O
a O
single O
dominant O
trend O
with O
a O
few O
rambunctious O
alternatives O
jostling O
for O
supremacy O
. O

Art O
is O
eclectic O
-- O

and O
today O
we O
take O
that O
eclecticism O
for O
granted O
. O

Look O
around O
. O

The O
extreme O
breadth O
of O
artistic O
diversity O
is O
so O
familiar O
and O
so O
routine O
as O
to O
border O
on O
invisibility O
. O

Take O
the O
2006 B-DATE
California B-EVENT
Biennial I-EVENT
at O
the B-FAC
Orange I-FAC
County I-FAC
Museum I-FAC
of I-FAC
Art I-FAC
, O
opening O
today O
. O

It O
is O
typical O
of O
most O
such O
surveys O
, O
which O
are O
commonplace O
in O
an O
art O
scene O
now O
sprawling O
from O
Berlin B-GPE
to O
Beijing B-GPE
. O

This O
installment O
includes O
Jane B-PERSON
Callister I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
punchy O
abstract O
paintings O
, O
which O
skillfully O
exploit O
the O
capacity O
of O
paint O
to O
multi-task O
. O

Like O
a O
diary O
, O
her O
paint O
records O
the O
artist O
's O
physical O
process O
in O
making O
the O
work O
. O

It O
also O
has O
a O
tendency O
to O
run O
, O
mix O
or O
separate O
of O
its O
own O
accord O
, O
as O
if O
an O
inert O
material O
made O
from O
pigment O
bound O
in O
acrylic O
resin O
had O
an O
independent O
mind O
and O
will O
. O

And O
it O
possesses O
a O
stubborn O
inclination O
to O
represent O
recognizable O
things O
in O
the O
world O
-- O
especially O
landscape O
-- O
in O
wholly O
unexpected O
, O
even O
apocalyptic O
ways O
. O

But O
the B-EVENT
California I-EVENT
Biennial I-EVENT
, O
without O
seeming O
the O
least O
bit O
dissonant O
, O
can O
also O
accommodate O
art O
with O
no O
relationship O
whatever O
to O
Callister B-PERSON
's O
inventive O
reworking O
of O
postwar O
abstraction O
's O
various O
shibboleths O
. O

There O
's O
the O
show O
business O
shtick O
of O
the O
performance O
troupe O
My B-ORG
Barbarian I-ORG
, O
which O
turns O
homemade O

And O
the O
architectural O
photographs O
of O
precarious O
or O
ruined O

by O
Amir B-PERSON
Zaki I-PERSON
assert O
that O
disintegration O
and O

are O
the O
inescapable O
, O
unseen O
corollary O
of O
the O
lovely O

found O
in O
our O

Speaking O
of O
buildings O
, O
for O
a O
current O

in O
Pasadena B-GPE
, O
Carlos B-PERSON
Mollura I-PERSON
has O
inserted O
polyethylene O
cubes O

spheres O
and O
other O
geometric O
shapes O
into O
architectural O
orifices O
at O
a O
Colorado B-FAC
Boulevard I-FAC
shopping O

. O

As O
each O
fat O

inflatable O
form O
strains O
against O
the O
buildings O
' O
walls O
and O
windows O
with O
playful O
, O
even O
comic O
authority O
, O
empty O
space O
becomes O
elastic O
, O
muscular O
and O
apparently O
ready O
to O
burst O
. O

Geometry O
is O
ostensibly O
neutral O
. O

But O
in O
the O
context O
of O
this O
shopping O
arcade O
, O
these O
geometric O
forms O
inescapably O
imply O
that O
hidden O
powers O
of O
urban O
gentrification O
are O
at O
work O
. O

the O

one B-CARDINAL
deceptively O

quite O
a O

Katie B-PERSON

an O

What O
's O
going O
on O
with O

Clearly O
a O
lot O

Yet O
Callister B-PERSON
, O
My B-ORG
Barbarian I-ORG
, O
Ybarra B-PERSON
and O
Zaki B-PERSON
comfortably O
cohabit O
in O
a O
single O

. O

Mollura B-PERSON

Johnson B-PERSON

are O
all O
first B-ORDINAL

and O
none O
makes O

that O
even O

the O

. O

Their O
disparate O
works O
cover O
the O

. O

Many O
of O
these O

do O
evoke O
a O
world O
coming O
apart O
at O
the O

. O

-LRB- O
Given O
current O

, O
how O
could O
they O
not O
? O
-RRB- O

But O
the O
stresses O
and O
strains O
of O
contemporary O
life O
register O
in O
heterogeneous O
ways O
. O

And O
their O
extreme O
eclecticism O
is O
not O
exclusive O
to O
California B-GPE
. O

It O
's O
the O
norm O
everywhere O
today O
. O

' O
Pluralism O
' O
does O
n't O
do O
it O
justice O

I O
use O
the O
word O
`` O
eclectic O
'' O
rather O
than O
`` O
pluralist O
'' O
for O
a O
reason O
. O

Eclecticism O
is O
a O
virtue O
because O
not O
only O
does O
it O
draw O
from O
a O
variety O
of O
sources O
and O
promote O
divergent O
positions O
, O
it O
also O
makes O
an O
argument O
about O
what O
is O
best O
among O
the O
various O
doctrines O
, O
methods O
or O
styles O
it O
employs O
. O

Eclecticism O
is O
elitist O
in O
the O
finest O
sense O
of O
that O
widely O
misused O
word O
, O
which O
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
old O
- O
fashioned O
notions O
of O
exclusive O
aristocratic O
taste O
and O
everything O
to O
do O
with O
embracing O
diversity O
while O
also O
demanding O
quality O
. O

In O
the O
1980s B-DATE
some O
critics O
advanced O
pluralism O
as O
art O
's O
natural O
condition O
. O

They O
were O
partly O
right O
. O

The O
idea O
that O
two B-CARDINAL
or I-CARDINAL
more I-CARDINAL
kinds O
of O
ultimate O
artistic O
reality O
could O
comfortably O
coexist O
has O
n't O
always O
been O
in O
vogue O
. O

Twentieth B-DATE
century I-DATE
art O
was O
long O
charted O
as O
an O
almost O
linear O
succession O
of O
`` O
isms O
'' O
-- O
from O
Fauvism O
in O
1905 B-DATE
to O
Abstract O
Expressionism O
in O
the O
1950s B-DATE
-- O
discrete O
movements O
that O
each O
expressed O
its O
own O
unitary O
view O
of O
things O
. O

The O
monolithic O
view O
that O
had O
congealed O
by O
the O
1960s B-DATE
was O
a O
belief O
that O
the O
eye O
held O
dominion O
over O
art O
. O

That O
limited O
judgment O
was O
toppled O
by O
Conceptualism O
, O
which O
devalued O
everything O
visual O
in O
art O
and O
instead O
polished O
up O
the O
stature O
of O
ideas O
. O

`` O
The O
idea O
becomes O
the O
machine O
that O
makes O
the O
art O
, O
'' O
Sol B-PERSON
LeWitt I-PERSON
famously O
wrote O
in O
1967 B-DATE
to O
explain O
Conceptual O
art O
. O

And O
the O
idea O
could O
range O
far O
and O
wide O
, O
encompassing O
virtually O
any O
subject O
, O
attitude O
or O
experience O
one O
might O
imagine O
. O

Looking O
back O
from O
today O
's O
art O
world O
, O
though O
, O
a O
slightly O
different O
history O
of O
eclectic O
art O
suggests O
itself O
. O

Conceptual O
art O
does O
n't O
mark O
the O
decisive O
break O
, O
just O
the O
elaboration O
and O
consolidation O
of O
an O
idea O
already O
in O
play O
. O

Pop O
art O
marks O
the O
most O
profound O
rupture O
. O

The O
landmark O

of O
Robert B-PERSON
Rauschenberg I-PERSON

1950s B-DATE

of O
painting O
and O

that O

together O
with O
Jasper B-PERSON

, O
set O
the O
stage O

Their O

undermined O
art O

Pop O

tipped O
it O
over O

With O
its O

subject O
matter O
, O
pitch O
- O
perfect O
sense O
of O
style O
, O
wicked O
humor O
, O
easy O
sociability O
and O
serious O
refusal O
to O
take O
art O
too O
seriously O
, O
Pop O
made O
hash O

the O

An O

of O
an O

this O
hierarchy O
of O
high O

was O
traded O
in O

a O

bond O

New B-GPE

Virginia B-GPE
may O
be O
the O
best O
managed O
state O
in O
the O
country O
when O
the O
politicians O
are O
actually O
speaking O
to O
one O
another O

but O
it O
's O
not O
looking O
terribly O
well O
managed O
right O
now O
. O

Only O
two B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
on O
the O
heels O
of O
the O
last O
recession O
, O
Virginia B-GPE
's O
political O
class O
was O
consternated O
that O
the O
state O
's O
AAA O
bond O
rating O
might O
be O
cut O
. O

Would O
n't O
it O
be O
ironic O
if O
, O
despite O
the O
2004 B-DATE
tax O
increase O
and O
a O

, O
the O

agencies O
cut O
Virginia B-GPE

bond O
rating O
anyway O
this B-DATE
year I-DATE
? O

It O
would O
appear O
given O
the O
deadlocks O
and O
disputes O
that O
have O
afflicted O
our O
General B-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
since O
2001 B-DATE
, O
the O
vaunted O
Republican B-NORP
majority O
is O
just O
not O
now O
nor O
has O
it O
ever O
been O
ready O
for O
prime O

governing O
. O

Anon O
: O
' O
Ever O
' O
is O
a O
bit O
of O
hyperbole O
. O

The O
RINOs O
are O
unfit O
to O
govern O
. O

That O
is O
for O
sure O
. O

The O
phony O
bond O
crisis O
of O
04 B-DATE
was O
that O
Virginia B-GPE
could O
' O
only O
' O
borrow O
$ B-MONEY
800 I-MONEY
m I-MONEY
if O
the O
Commonwealth B-GPE
wanted O
to O
do O
so O
. O

Why O
Mr. O
Atticus B-PERSON
Bowden I-PERSON
, O
if O
`` O
ever O
'' O
were O
hyperbole O
perhaps O
you O
could O
tell O
me O
when O
they O
did O
manage O
to O
govern O
-- O
all O
by O
themselves O
, O
of O
course O
? O

The O
last O
time O
they O
did O
have O
a O
chance O
was O
in O
the B-DATE
19th I-DATE
Century I-DATE
. O

As O
I O
recall O
the O
Republican B-NORP
and O
Readjuster B-NORP
movement O
failed O
then O
, O
too O
. O

The O
beauty O
of O
democracy O
is O
that O
people O
get O
the O
government O
they O
deserve O
. O

We O
in O
Virginia B-GPE
drank O
the B-PRODUCT
Kool I-PRODUCT

and O
elected O
a O
bunch O
of O

warrior O
idealogues O
instead O
of O
good O
, O
pragmatic O
stewards O
. O

We O
get O
what O
we O
deserve O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
it O
would O
be O
better O
to O
imperil O
our O
bond O
rating O
than O
to O
pass O
a O
budget O
that O
continues O
the O
taxation O
practices O
of O
the O
past O
two B-CARDINAL
general B-ORG
assemblies I-ORG
. O

I O
patently O
reject O
the O
idea O
that O
the O
only O
way O
out O
of O
this O
morass O
is O
to O
pass O
a O
budget O
that O
has O
a O
net O
tax O
increase O
. O

We O
have O
to O
get O
off O
this O
tax O
and O
spend O
merry O
- O
go O
- O
round O
. O

It O
's O
time O
we O
Republicans B-NORP
return O
to O
our O
roots O
of O
fiscal O
conservancy O
. O

it O
sounds O
like O

After O
seeing O
the O
list O
of O
what O
would O
not O
be O
open O

/ O
or O
on O
duty O
... O
which O
I O
'm O
also O
quite O
sure O
is O
not O
complete O
... O
I O
'll O
go O
out O
on O
a O

.... O
and O
predict O
... O
that O
this O
will O
not O
happen O

and O
what O
is O
really O
going O

is O
the O
GA B-ORG
equivalent O
of O
two B-CARDINAL
cars O
speeding O
towards O
each O
other O
until O
someone O
blinks O
. O

I O
'll O
also O
predict O
... O
that O
the O
classic O
fall O

back O
position O
for O
Virginia B-GPE
is O
the O
same O
one O
used O
by O
the O

- O

continue O
the O

using O
last O

continuing O
resolution O

all O
that O
stuff O
. O

On O
the O
actual O
issue O
of O
how O
much O
tax O
is O
enough O
- O
I O
find O
myself O
influenced O
by O
both O
sides O
' O
arguments O
to O
a O
certain O
extent O

but O
I O
guess O
what O
I O
can O
not O
understand O
is O
that O
all O
things O
being O
equal O
.. O
does O
n't O
population O
growth O
result O
in O
MORE O
tax O
revenues O
that O
would O
be O
allocated O
presumedly O
as O
they O
were O
before O
- O
in O
other O
words O
priorities O
remain O
the O
same O
in O
terms O
of O
allocations O
? O

If O
everyone O
- O
those O
already O
here O
plus O
our O
population O
growth O
is O
to O
pay O
HIGHER O
taxes O
- O
should O
there O
be O
an O
expectation O
on O
the O
part O
of O
taxpayers O
to O
receive O
MORE O
services O
... O
and O
of O
course O
.... O
what O
about O
those O
that O
are O
opposed O
to O
the O
government O
providing O
services O
that O
private O
industry O
could O
do O
- O
for O
less O
. O

This O
certainly O
goes O
for O
transportation O
where O
we O
talk O
about O
a O
`` O
crisis O
'' O
that O
can O
ONLY O
be O
solved O
by O
higher O

The O

`` O

So O
reads O
an O
accurate O
testimonial O
to O
the O
personal O
and O
artistic O
sentiment O
of O
this O
odd O
and O
serious O
filmmaker O
. O

Like O
many O
of O
his O
contemporary O
surrealists O
, O
Bunuel B-PERSON
is O
a O
paradox O
who O
on O
one B-CARDINAL
hand O
claims O
apathy O
towards O
ultimate O
end O
, O
being O
, O
and O
Being O
, O
yet O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
loads O
his O
impressive O
body O
of O
work O
with O
moribund O
imagery O
and O
strange O
ideas O
about O
the O
God O
he O
so O
vociferously O
denies O
. O

Bunuel B-PERSON
exhibits O
a O
radical O
, O
iconoclastic O
view O
of O
the O
world O
in O
which O
he O
finds O
society O
decadent O
and O
antithetical O
to O
human O
liberation O
. O

He O
has O
been O
called O
a O
realist O
, O
a O
surrealist O
, O
a O
Marxist B-NORP
, O
an O
anarchist O
, O
a O
mystic O
, O
an O
anticleric O
, O
a O
Freudian B-NORP
, O
a O
post-Freudian B-NORP
, O
a O
sadist O

a O
moralist O
, O
a O
Christian B-NORP
, O
and O
a O
poet O
- O
showman O
of O
the O
macabre O
. O

His O
scenarios O
range O
from O
the O
absurd O
to O
the O
tragic O
to O
the O
satiric O
to O
the O
erotic O
, O
profusely O
endued O
with O
the O
outrageous O
and O
the O
scandalous O
. O

Luis B-PERSON
Bunuel I-PERSON
has O
long O
been O
recognized O
in O
European B-NORP
critical O
circles O
as O
a O
great O
and O
prolific O
filmmaker O
on O
a O
par O
with O
Eisenstein B-PERSON
, O
Chaplin B-PERSON
, O
and O
Fellini B-PERSON
. O

However O
, O
only O
recently O
has O
his O
reputation O
in O
America B-GPE
begun O
to O
catch O
up O
. O

Over O
his O
fifty B-DATE

directed O

France B-GPE

. O

Utilizing O
sardonic O
humor O
and O
the O
imagery O
of O
surrealism O
, O
Bunuel B-PERSON
set O
out O
to O
undermine O
the O

take O

Bunuel B-PERSON
says O
: O
My O
infancy O
slipped O
by O
in O
an O
almost O
medieval O
atmosphere O
-LRB- O
like O
that O
of O
nearly O
all O
the O
Spanish B-NORP
provinces O
-RRB- O
between O
my O
native O
town O
and O
Zaragova B-GPE

I O
feel O
it O
necessary O
to O
say O
here O
-LRB- O
since O
it O
explains O
in O
part O
the O
trend O
of O
the O
modest O
work O
which O
I O
later O
accomplished O

that O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
basic O
sentiments O
of O
my O
childhood O
which O
stayed O
with O
me O
well O
into O
adolescence O
, O
are O
those O
of O
a O
profound O
eroticism O
, O
at O
first O
sublimated O
in O
a O
great O
religious O
faith O

and O
a O
permanent O
consciousness O
of O
death O
. O

It O
would O
take O
too O
long O
here O
to O
analyze O
the O
reasons O
. O

It O
suffices O
that O
I O
was O
not O
an O
exception O
among O
my O
compatriots O
, O
since O
this O
is O
a O
very O
Spanish B-NORP
characteristic O
, O
and O
our O
art O
, O
exponent O
of O
the O
Spanish B-NORP
spirit O
, O
was O
impregnated O
with O
these O
two B-CARDINAL
sentiments O
. O

The O
last O
civil O
war O
, O
peculiar O
and O
ferocious O
as O
no O
other O
exposed O
them O
clearly O
. O

Coming O
of O
age O
, O
Bunuel B-PERSON
expressed O
a O
strong O
urge O
to O
go O
to O
Paris B-GPE
to O
study O
music O
but O
was O
sent O
instead O
to O
Madrid B-GPE
to O
study O
agricultural O
engineering O
. O

After O
a O
few O
years O
, O
he O
switched O
his O
studies O
to O
entomology O
, O
and O
, O
more O
importantly O
, O
began O
forming O
close O
friendships O
with O
a O
group O
of O
young O
artists O
who O
were O
to O
influence O
him O
strongly O
in O
the O
future O
. O

These O
companions O
included O
the O
poets O
Frederico B-PERSON
Garcia I-PERSON
Lorca I-PERSON
and O
Jose B-PERSON
Moreno I-PERSON
Villa I-PERSON
and O
the O
painter O
Salvador B-PERSON
Dali I-PERSON

In O
the O
Madrid B-GPE
residencia O
Bunuel B-PERSON
developed O
his O
interest O
in O
the O
arts O
, O
theater O
, O
and O
acting O
and O
gained O
his O
introduction O
to O
surrealism O
. O

After O
graduating O
in O
1925 B-DATE
with O
a O
degree O
in O
Philosophy O

Letters O
, O
Bunuel B-PERSON
moved O
to O

joined O

a O
few O
members O

arrived O
in O

highly O
recommended O

was O
introduced O
into O
the O
best O

While O
honing O
his O
skills O
working O
as O
an O
A.D. O
, O
Bunuel B-PERSON
also O
began O
contributing O
articles O
to O
various O
literary O
cinema O
periodicals O
, O
most O
notably O
La B-ORG
Gaceta I-ORG
Hispanoamericana I-ORG

In O
1929 B-DATE
he O
formally O
entered O
the B-ORG
Paris I-ORG
Surrealist I-ORG
Group I-ORG
. O

Within O
this O
setting O
he O
embarked O
on O
his O
first O
film O
project O
as O
director O
, O
a O
collaboration O
with O
his O

friend O
Salvador B-PERSON

Some O
critics O
, O
most O
notably O
Pauline B-PERSON
Kael I-PERSON
and O
Penelope B-PERSON
Gilliatt I-PERSON
, O
now O
regard O
Bunuel B-PERSON
as O
the O
Hitchcock B-PERSON
of O
surrealism O
-- O
a O
venerated O
master O
in O
total O
command O
of O
his O
medium O
and O
for O
whom O
the O
art O
of O
filmic O
manipulation O
became O
a O
`` O
delightful O
form O
of O
play O
. O
'' O

For O
Bunuel B-PERSON
, O
however O
, O
play O
had O
little O
to O
do O
with O
it O
. O

Rather O
, O
he O
saw O
surrealism O
as O
a O
revolutionary O
, O
poetic O
, O
and O
moral O
movement O
: O

All O
of O
us O
were O
supporters O
of O
a O
certain O
concept O
of O
revolution O
, O
and O
although O
the O
surrealists O
did O
n't O
consider O
themselves O
terrorists O
, O
they O
were O
constantly O
fighting O
a O
society O
they O
despised O
. O

The O
principle O
weapon O
was O
not O
guns O
, O
of O
course O
, O
it O
was O
scandal O
. O

Scandal O
was O
a O
potent O
agent O
of O
revelation O
, O
capable O
of O
exposing O
such O
social O
crimes O
as O
exploitation O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
man O
by O
another O
, O
colonialist O
imperialism O
, O
religious O
tyranny O
-- O
in O
sum O
, O
all O
the O
secret O
and O
odious O
underpinnings O
of O
a O
system O
that O
had O
to O
be O
destroyed O
. O

He O
went O
on O
to O
say O
, O
`` O
The O
purpose O
of O
surrealism O
was O
not O
to O
create O
a O

the O

ideology O
, O
`` O
It O
is O
possible O
to O
systematize O
confusion O

Indeed O
, O
the O
intent O
of O
surreal O

is O
to O
move O
one O
from O
the O
conscious O

Bunuel B-PERSON
was O
drawn O
to O
the O
surrealist O
movement O
for O
more O
than O
revolutionary O
or O
psychological O
reasons O
. O

The O
moral O
aspects O
of O
the O
movement O
intrigued O
him O
as O
well O
: O

For O
the O
first O
time O
in O
my O
life O
, O
I O
'd O
come O
into O
contact O
with O
a O
coherent O
moral O
system O
that O
, O
as O
far O
as O
I O
could O
tell O
, O
had O
no O
flaws O
. O

It O
was O
an O
aggressive O
morality O
based O
on O
the O
complete O
rejection O
of O
all O
existing O
values O
. O

We O
had O
other O
criteria O
: O

we O
exalted O
passion O
, O
mystification O
, O
black O
humor O
, O
the O
insult O
, O
and O
the O
call O
of O
the O
abyss O
. O

Inside O
this O
new O
territory O
, O
all O
our O
thoughts O
and O
actions O
seemed O
justifiable O
; O

there O
was O
simply O
no O
room O
for O
doubt O
. O

Everything O
made O
sense O
. O

Our O
morality O
may O
have O
been O
more O
demanding O
and O
more O
dangerous O
than O
the O
prevailing O
order O
, O
but O
it O
was O
also O
stronger O
, O
richer O
, O
more O
coherent O
. O

The O
surreal O
qualities O
in O
Bunuel B-PERSON
's O
films O
can O
be O
traced O
to O
a O
number O
of O
sources O
, O

but O
the O
primary O
impetus O
was O
his O
`` O
irrational O
sensibility O
'' O
as O
evidenced O
by O
his O
treatment O
of O
image O
, O
montage O
, O
and O
sound O
. O

These O
gave O
his O
films O
their O
dreamlike O
quality O

His O
most O
intense O
images O
are O
evocative O
of O
either O
humor O
or O
mystery O

Reading O
between O
the O
lines O
of O
Gowen B-PERSON
's O
story O
, O
however O
, O
there O
seems O
to O
be O
one B-CARDINAL
big O
missing O
piece O
: O

Housing O
. O

Creating O
a O
livelier O
commercial O
district O
is O
a O
worthy O
goal O
. O

But O
creating O
a O
balanced O
community O
with O
a O
mix O
of O
housing O
, O
offices O
, O
shopping O
and O
other O
amenities O
-- O
allowing O
people O
to O
live O
close O
to O
where O
they O
work O
and O
play O
-- O
is O
an O
even O
more O
worthy O
goal O
. O

As O
Ed B-PERSON
Risse I-PERSON
has O
pointed O
out O
, O
the O
relocation O
of O
17,000 B-CARDINAL
jobs O
creates O
a O
rare O
opportunity O
to O
create O
a O
genuine O
balanced O
communities O
in O
Northern B-LOC
Virginia I-LOC
. O

The O
problem O
, O
I O
surmise O
-- O
it O
's O
not O
discussed O
in O
the O
story O
-- O
is O
that O
Arlington B-GPE
is O
concerned O
about O
protecting O
its O
tax O
base O
, O
which O
means O
replacing O
the O
vacated O
offices O
with O
new O
offices O
, O
not O
housing O
. O

It O
's O
hard O
to O
fault O
Arlington B-GPE
for O
pursuing O
its O
short O
- O
term O
self O
interest O
. O

But O
everyone O
needs O
to O
recognize O
that O
Arlington B-GPE
's O
decision O
not O
to O
pursue O
a O
balanced O
community O
means O
that O
housing O
will O
end O
up O
somewhere O
else O
, O
presumably O
in O
outlying O
counties O
. O

And O
employees O
working O
in O
the O
buffed O
up O
Crystal B-LOC
City I-LOC
will O
wind O
up O
commuting O
long O
distances O
and O
clogging O
Northern B-LOC
Virginia I-LOC
thoroughfares O
. O

And O
the O
cry O
for O
new O
transportation O
revenues O
will O
grow O
ever O
more O
deafening O
. O

Right O
on O
. O

Did O
n't O
I O
read O
somewhere O
that O
some O
of O
those O
office O
buildings O
were O
considered O
worn O
out O
and O
that O
they O
would O
be O
demolished O
and O
replaced O
rather O
than O
refurbished O
? O

Would O
that O
be O
an O
opportunity O
for O
more O
mixed O
use O
? O

Is O
it O
an O
example O
of O
`` O
existing O
infrastructure O
'' O
that O
is O
worn O
out O
and O
outlived O
its O
usefuleness O
? O

This O
post O
has O
been O
removed O
by O
the O
author O
. O

Jim B-PERSON
, O
minor O
point O
- O

unlike O
most O
other O
Virginia B-GPE
counties O
, O
Arlington B-GPE
County I-GPE
does O
not O
have O
a B-ORG
Board I-ORG
of I-ORG
Supervisors I-ORG
. O

It O
does O
have O
a B-ORG
County I-ORG
Board I-ORG
. O

Members O
of O
the B-ORG
Arlington I-ORG
County I-ORG
Board I-ORG
are O
addressed O
not O
as O
supervisors O
, O
but O
as O
Board O
Members O
. O

If O
Arlington B-GPE
has O
sufficient O
public O
infrastructure O
to O
support O
housing O
at O
Crystal B-LOC
City I-LOC
, O
adding O
housing O
to O
that O
area O
would O
be O
an O
excellent O
idea O
. O

The O
question O
that O
the O
Arlington B-GPE
community O
needs O
to O
answer O
is O
: O
Whether O
the O
supporting O
infrastructure O
is O
sufficient O
? O

If O
not O
, O
what O
is O
the O
incentive O
for O
Arlingtonians B-NORP
to O
dig O
deeper O
in O
their O
pockets O
to O
pay O
for O
public O
infrastructure O
so O
that O
the O
housing O
does O
not O
get O
constructed O
in O
outlying O
counties O
? O

The O
funds O
run O
one B-CARDINAL
way O
from O
Arlington B-GPE
, O
just O
as O
they O
do O
from O
Fairfax B-GPE
-- O
down O
to O
Richmond B-GPE
and O
then O
around O
the O
state O
. O

Moreover O
, O
while O
I O
'm O
sure O
that O
many O
people O
would O
enjoy O
the O
urban O
life O
of O
a O
newly O
revitalized O
Crystal B-LOC
City I-LOC
, O
many O
others O
would O
not O
. O

Many O
people O
simply O
want O
to O
live O
in O
single O
family O
, O
detached O
homes O
that O
will O
not O
be O
available O
in O
Crystal B-LOC
City I-LOC
. O

Further O
, O
any O
housing O
built O
in O
that O
area O
will O
likey O
be O
quite O
costly O
given O
the O
price O
of O
land O
and O
the O
costs O
to O
construct O
high O
- O
rise O
buildings O
. O

Ray B-PERSON
Hyde I-PERSON
has O
persuaded O
me O
that O
we O
need O
to O
provide O
incentives O
for O
good O
quality O
, O
higher O
paying O
jobs O
to O
locate O
in O
outlying O
areas O
. O

There O
probably O
are O
n't O
enough O
tax O
dollars O
-- O
even O
in O
the O
mind O
of O
John B-PERSON
Chichester I-PERSON
-- O
to O
fix O
NoVA B-LOC
's O
transportation O
and O
other O
infrastructure O
problems O
that O
are O
, O
in O
large O
part O
, O
based O
on O
the O
high O
concentration O
of O
good O
- O
paying O
jobs O
here O
, O
along O
with O
a O
lack O
of O
both O
affordable O
housing O
. O

Unless O
builders O
are O
going O
to O
supply O
affordable O
housing O
at O
a O
loss O
-- O
which O
, O
to O
me O
, O
seems O
absurd O
, O
there O
wo O
n't O
be O
affordable O
housing O
here O
without O
even O
more O
tax O
subsidies O
. O

-LRB- O
Of O
course O
, O
every O
tax O
dollar O
spent O
on O
subsidizing O
housing O
is O
n't O
available O
for O
other O
purposes O
. O
-RRB- O

That O
suggests O
sprawl O
will O
continue O
, O
as O
will O
the O
demand O
for O
more O
and O
more O
roads O
and O
other O
infrastructure O
. O

Virginia B-GPE
needs O
balanced O
job O
growth O
. O

In O
theory O
, O
the O
loss O
of O
these O
jobs O
presents O
an O
opportunity O
to O
do O
something O
different O
in O
terms O
of O
settlement O
patterns O
. O

Perhaps O
to O
replace O
commercial O
businesses O
with O
housing O
and O
/ O
or O
more O
balanced O
mixed O
- O
use O
. O

Lots O
of O
questions O
here O
but O
I O
do O
agree O
.. O
just O
the O
potential O
concept O
is O
provocative O
... O

But O
, O
what O
would O
be O
the O
benefit O
to O
Arlington B-GPE
to O
do O
this O
? O

More O
specifically O
- O
what O
would O
be O
the O
benefit O
to O
those O
who O
already O
live O
and O
pay O
taxes O
in O
Arlington B-GPE
? O

What O
would O
Arlington B-GPE
have O
to O
provide O
in O
the O
way O
of O
additional O
infrastructure O
? O

-LRB- O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
that O
I O
would O
agree O
that O
more O
infrastructure O
would O
be O
needed O
for O
residential O
vs O
commercial O
but O
let O
's O
explore O
it O
. O

It O
would O
seem O
to O
be O
that O
if O
you O
took O
an O
office O
building O
in O
Crystal B-LOC
and O
converted O
it O
to O
apartments O
.. O
you O
'd O
not O
have O
any O
more O
people O
-LRB- O
perhaps O
less O
-RRB- O
so O
you O
would O
n't O
need O
any O
more O
water O
/ O
sewer O
capacity O
... O
and O
ditto O
for O
parking O
places O
... O
at O
least O
it O
would O
seem O
so O
-RRB- O
. O

Ditto O
with O
commuting O
... O

instead O
of O
a O
hoard O
of O
folks O
`` O
in O
commuting O
'' O
from O
outer O
jurisdictions O
to O
Arlington B-GPE
every O
morning O
, O
would O
n't O
you O
have O
instead O
- O
more O
`` O
out O
'' O
commuting O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
folks O
who O
actually O
own O
the O
land O
- O
would O
they O
agree O
to O
a O
change O
in O
the O
zoning O
from O
Office O
Commercial O
to O
Apartment O
Residential O
? O

What O
would O
be O
the O
economics O
of O
this O
with O
respect O
to O
those O
who O
hold O
those O
properties O
as O
investments O
? O

It O
would O
seem O
- O
that O
Arlington B-GPE
and O
the O
other O
area O
jurisdictions O
have O
already O
had O
such O
a O
choice O
for O
years B-DATE
- O
and O
that O
they O
chose O
commercial O
development O
over O
residential O
- O
in O
effect O
- O
letting O
more O
remote O
jurisdictions O
figure O
out O
how O
to O
provide O
residential O
for O
folks O
who O
wanted O
to O
work O
in O
NoVa B-LOC
and O
commute O
to O
the O
outer O
suburbs O
to O
live O
. O

To O
a O
certain O
extent O
- O
one O
could O
say O
that O
No B-LOC
Va I-LOC
jurisdictions O
have O
a O
responsibility O
to O
provide O
housing O
for O
those O
that O
work O
in O
the O
same O
area O
and O
NOT O
force O
workers O
to O
commute O
to O
outer O
jursidictions O
for O
housing O
in O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
place O
. O

In O
the O
end O
- O
every O
worker O
who O
, O
for O
whatever O
reason O
, O
ends O
up O
commuting O
... O
that O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
more O
person O
using O
the O
transportation O
network O
more O
intensively O
than O
those O
that O
live O
locally O
with O
shorter O
commutes O
. O

So O
.. O
here O
's O
a O
concluding O
thought O
. O

What O
kind O
of O
an O
exercise O
would O
it O
be O
for O
each O
NoVa B-LOC
jurisdiction O
to O
total O
up O
the O
number O
of O
jobs O
in O
its O
boundaries O
verses O
the O
amount O
of O
housing O
within O
its O
boundaries O
. O

Would O
we O
see O
a O
big O
disparity O
? O

I O
know O
where O
I O
live O
in O
the O
outer O
suburbs O
that O
there O
IS O
a O
big O
disparity O
in O
the O
opposite O
sense O
. O

We O
have O
far O
, O
far O
more O
people O
in O
homes O
than O
we O
have O
jobs O
for O
them O
. O

In O
other O
words O
a O
huge O
percent O
of O
our O
population O
are O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
NoVa B-LOC
commuters O
. O

With O
respect O
to O
the O
jobs O
/ O
housing O
question O
- O
I O
wonder O
what O
the O
totals O
would O
be O
for O
the O
entire O
NoVa B-LOC
area O
- O
all O
jursidictions O
with O
respect O
to O
jobs O
verses O
housing O
. O

From O
an O
equity O
perspective O
- O
should O
jurisdictions O
provide O
as O
much O
housing O
as O
they O
have O
jobs O
? O

The O
mechanism O
for O
doing O
this O
would O
be O
zoning O
- O

a O
certain O
percentage O
of O
areas O
would O
be O
reserved O
ONLY O
for O
residential O
development O
or O
areas O
designated O
for O
mixed O
use O
development O
would O
have O
a O
hard O
percentage O
cap O
on O
how O
much O
residential O
had O
to O
be O
part O
of O
the O
mixed O
- O
used O
proposal O
. O

Or O
to O
turn O
this O
completely O
around O
- O
would O
folks O
support O
the O
right O
of O
any O
jurisdiction O
to O
zone O
entirely O
that O
jurisdiction O
for O
commercial O
/ O
industrial O
ONLY O
and O
let O
outlying O
jurisdictions O
provide O
residential O
? O

In O
some O
respects O
, O
is O
n't O
that O
essentially O
what O
No B-LOC
Va I-LOC
jursidictions O
are O
doing O
- O
favoring O
non-residential O
development O
and O
letting O
other O
jursidictions O
handle O
the O
residential O
? O

Turning O
this O
on O
its O
head O
- O
what O
is O
the O
incentive O
for O
a O
worker O
in O
Crystal B-LOC
City I-LOC
to O
buy O
there O
? O

Most O
jobs O
now O
do O
n't O
last O
for O
decades B-DATE
- O
no O
one O
expects O
a O
career O
at O
a O
company O
any O
more O
. O

I O
would O
n't O
buy O
a O
house O
for O
one B-DATE
specific O
job O
- O

but O
if O
I O
bought O
at O
Crystal B-LOC
City I-LOC
, O
I O
'd O
be O
locked O
in O
to O
that O
area O
. O

What O
happens O
if O
my O
next O
job O
is O
in O
Silver B-GPE
Spring I-GPE
, O
or O
Leesburg B-GPE
, O
or O
Quantico B-GPE
? O

Am O
I O
supposed O
to O
buy O
and O
sell O
my O
house O
each O
time O
I O
change O
jobs O
? O

I O
've O
been O
through O
six B-CARDINAL
-LRB- O
high O
tech O
-RRB- O
jobs O
in O
the O
past O
14 B-DATE
years I-DATE
- O
all O
while O
living O
at O
the O
same O
house O
, O
all O
good O
jobs O
and O
good O
career O
moves O
. O

If O
I O
changed O
houses O
like O
the O
tech O
field O
requires O
you O
to O
change O
jobs O
, O
I O
'd O
spend O
my O
entire O
life O
packing O
and O
unpacking O
. O

Living O
where O
you O
work O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
those O
`` O
nice O

, O
not O
real O
practical O
'' O

of O

Anonymous O

you O

People O
change O

a O

and O
no O

can O
afford O
to O
move O
to O
a O
new O
house O
every O
time O
they O
get O
a O
new O
job O
. O

That O
's O
why O
people O
pay O
a O
premium O
to O
live O
in O
a O
central O
location O
-- O

it O
gives O
them O
proximity O

Larry B-PERSON
, O
This O
is O
my O
personal O
conviction O
: O

If O
local O
governments O
were O
not O
given O
the O
power O
to O
restrict O
housing O
development O
through O
zoning O
, O
a O
free O
market O
would O
provide O
a O
much O
better O
balance O
of O
housing O
/ O
jobs O
/ O
retail O
/ O
amenities O
than O
what O
we O
have O
now O
. O

The O
answer O
is O
less O
regulation O
, O
not O
more O
. O

Jim B-PERSON
: O
I O
believe O
in O
free O
markets O
as O
well O
, O
but O
I O
also O
hold O
that O
free O
markets O
are O
equally O
as O
free O
of O
economic O
subsidies O
as O
well O
as O
over O
- O
burdensome O
regulation O
. O

What O
is O
the O
argument O
that O
letting O
people O
develop O
their O
property O
as O
desired O
without O
regard O
to O
the O
impact O
on O
existing O
residents O
and O
businesses O
is O
a O
free O
market O
? O

None O
of O
us O
would O
likely O
support O
the O
abolishment O
of O
all O
zoning O
as O
is O
basically O
the O
case O
in O
Houston B-GPE
. O

Would O
we O
find O
it O
acceptable O
to O
allow O
the O
construction O
of O
a O
foundary O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
residential O
neighborhood O
? O

What O
about O
building O
a O
30 B-CARDINAL
- O
story O
building O
in O
the O
flight O
path O
of O
Dulles B-FAC
Airport I-FAC
? O

Few O
of O
us O
would O
likely O
support O
that O
. O

We O
have O
a O
serious O
problem O
with O
public O
infrastructure O
in O
areas O
of O
Virginia B-GPE
. O

Few O
dispute O
that O
. O

What O
we O
argue O
over O
is O
who O
is O
responsible O
to O
fund O
the O
necessary O
infrastructure O
; O
to O
what O
amount O
; O
and O
should O
people O
be O
permitted O
to O
build O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
adequate O
public O
facilities O
. O

Reasonable O
people O
can O
answer O
these O
questions O
differently O
. O

But O
, O
at O
some O
point O
, O
there O
is O
a O
question O
of O
basic O
equity O
that O
must O
be O
answered O
: O

How O
much O
`` O
cost O
'' O
should O
society O
be O
able O
to O
impose O
on O
an O
existing O
resident O
/ O
business O
so O
that O
someone O
else O
can O
use O
his O
or O
her O
property O
as O
they O
desire O
? O

Since O
we O
would O
n't O
permit O
the O
foundary O
to O
built O
in O
the O
residential O
neighborhood O
, O
we O
all O
effectively O
agree O
that O
there O
are O
limits O
to O
how O
much O
cost O
we O
are O
willing O
to O
impose O
on O
existing O
residents O
. O

Stated O
alternatively O
, O
one O
does O
not O
have O
an O
absolute O
right O
to O
use O
his O
/ O
her O
property O
as O
desired O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
question O
we O
might O
ask O
is O
: O
Who O
is O
the O
cost O
- O
causer O
? O

The O
answer O
is O
always O
going O
to O
be O
`` O
the O
newcomer O
. O
'' O

One O
might O
also O
ask O
: O
At O
what O
point O
does O
it O
become O
unfair O
to O
load O
all O
of O
the O
costs O
on O
the O
newcomer O
? O

Few O
would O
likely O
argue O
that O
, O
because O
of O
the O
high O
forward O
- O
looking O
costs O
for O
constructing O
infrastructure O
, O
we O
should O
not O
permit O
any O
building O
in O
Virginia B-GPE
without O
the O
upfront O
payment O
of O
the O
total O
costs O
for O
constructing O
infrastructure O
. O

That O
would O
be O
unfair O
. O

But O
, O
at O
the O
very O
same O
time O
, O
is O
n't O
equally O
unfair O
to O
load O
all O
of O
the O
infrastructure O
costs O
on O
taxpayers O
-- O
especially O
given O
Virginia B-GPE
's O
tax O
structure O
that O
takes O
much O
from O
NoVA B-LOC
and O
gives O
little O
back O
? O

One O
might O
be O
able O
to O
make O
a O
good O
argument O
that O
we O
could O
save O
transportation O
costs O
by O
building O
densely O
in O
NoVA B-LOC
. O

But O
what O
about O
the O
other O
infrastructure O
costs O
that O
are O
then O
imposed O
on O
residents O
of O
NoVA B-LOC
? O

What O
's O
in O
it O
for O
us O
? O

re O
: O
WaPo B-ORG
article O
. O

yes O
, O
agree O
it O
was O
excellent O
in O
describing O
the O
issues O
. O

But O
I O
'm O
perplexed O
... O
as O
usual O
... O

`` O
because O
employers O
' O
first B-ORDINAL
priority O
is O
being O
near O
a O
qualified O
workforce O
, O
and O
residents O
continue O
to O
seek O
affordable O
, O
spacious O
homes O
and O
good O
schools O
in O
more O
distant O
communities O
. O
'' O

I O
found O
this O
rather O
odd O
in O
that O
the O
concept O
of O
`` O
near O
'' O
is O
apparently O
perceived O
differently O
depending O
on O
whether O
you O
were O
an O
employer O
or O
an O
employee O
. O

employers O
want O
to O
be O
`` O
near O
'' O
a O
qualified O
workforce O
but O
employees O
-LRB- O
note O
they O
use O
the O
word O
residents O
-RRB- O
continue O
to O
seek O
... O
homes O
in O
more O
distant O
communities O
. O

Unless O
I O
'm O
not O
reading O
it O
properly O
... O
it O
sounds O
like O
the O
employers O
' O
concept O
of O
`` O
near O
'' O
is O
a O
very O
different O
concept O
than O
the O
employee O
's O
concept O
of O
a O
`` O
near O
'' O
place O
to O
live O
. O

Would O
n't O
one O
presume O
that O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
concepts O
be O
the O
same O
... O
that O
the O
employee O
would O
want O
to O
be O
near O
where O
a O
qualified O
workforce O
lives O
... O
AND O
vice O
versa O
? O

Also O
... O
discussed O
in O
BLOG O
was O
the O
idea O
that O
folks O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
move O
everytime O
they O
change O
jobs O
which O
is O
an O
excellent O
point O
but O
how O
does O
that O
explain O
folks O
who O
move O
to O
the O
outer O
burbs O
... O
and O
then O
change O
jobs O
that O
requires O
even O
a O
longer O
commute O
? O

Are O
n't O
people O
who O
move O
to O
the O
outer O
burbs O
... O
for O
housing O
.. O
locking O
themselves O
in O
to O
a O
less O
flexible O
situation O
the O
same O
way O
that O
someone O
would O
in O
trying O
to O
live O
next O
door O
to O
where O
they O
work O
because O
in O
both O
cases O
.. O
if O
they O
change O
jobs O
- O
they O
've O
probably O
bought O
themselves O
a O
longer O
commute O
. O

Is O
n't O
it O
curious O
the O
employers O
want O
to O
be O
near O
a O
qualified O
work O
force O
? O

Would O
n't O
that O
result O
in O
less O
travel O
rather O
than O
more O
? O

The O
other O
comment O
of O
interest O
was O
that O
most O
residents O
of O
mixed O
use O
communities O
do O
n't O
find O
employment O
there O
. O

To O
the O
extent O
that O
some O
mixed O
use O
residents O
do O
find O
local O
employment O
that O
suits O
their O
skills O
, O
that O
is O
a O
good O
thing O
, O
and O
it O
will O
marginally O
reduce O
travel O
. O

But O
we O
should O
not O
count O
on O
it O
as O
a O
panacea O
, O
and O
it O
does O
not O
conflict O
with O
the O
idea O
that O
we O
need O
more O
places O
. O

`` O
Mixed O
use O
'' O
and O
`` O
more O
places O
'' O
are O
compatible O
ideas O
. O

The O
article O
should O
put O
to O
rest O
the O
argument O
that O
Ed B-PERSON
Risse I-PERSON
and O
I O
have O
had O
about O
job O
growth O
. O

His O
previous O
statement O
was O
that O
while O
the O
percet O
job O
growth O
in O
PW B-GPE
was O
high O
the O
absolute O
number O
was O
small O
. O

Today O
we O
see O
that O
the O
absolute O
numbers O
are O
also O
higher O
. O

If O
we O
choose O
to O
have O
a O
successful O
transportation O
plan O
then O
we O
should O
design O
the O
plan O
to O
meet O
the O
needs O
which O
will O
occur O
as O
a O
result O
of O
what O
is O
happening O
, O
rather O
than O
to O
meet O
the O
needs O
of O
what O
we O
wish O
would O
happen O
. O

Otherwise O
you O
have O
to O
design O
not O
only O
a O
transportation O
plan O
but O
a O
way O
to O
change O
everyone O
's O
decisions O
in O
such O
a O
way O
as O
to O
make O
it O
work O
. O

Today O
's O
article O
shows O
how O
difficult O
that O
is O
, O
so O
why O
choose O
a O
plan O
that O
is O
bound O
to O
fail O
? O

Metro B-FAC
will O
not O
ease O
congestion O
and O
it O
has O
n't O
done O
so O
for O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
thirty I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

What O
it O
does O
do O
is O
allow O
more O
people O
to O
travel O
to O
some O
places O
than O
can O
be O
acommodated O
by O
highways O
. O

It O
does O
that O
by O
offering O
a O
lower O
level O
of O
service O
and O
less O
comfort O
-LRB- O
standing O
room O
only O
-RRB- O
. O

It O
might O
be O
that O
there O
is O
still O
sufficient O
reason O
to O
spend O
billions B-MONEY
of I-MONEY
scarce I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
on O
Metro O
, O
but O
easing O
traffic O
congestion O
is O
n't O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
. O

We O
should O
evaluate O
the O
expenditure O
for O
what O
it O
does O
do O
and O
who O
benefits O
and O
assign O
the O
costs O
accordingly O
, O
if O
the O
expenditure O
is O
still O
reasonable O
. O

Clearly O
, O
that O
does O
not O
include O
billing O
the O
tollroad O
users O
for O
Metro B-FAC
construction O
. O

Making O
Route B-FAC
7 I-FAC
sixteen B-CARDINAL
lanes O
is O
probably O
just O
as O
bad O
an O
idea O
as O
Metro B-FAC
. O

That O
is O
just O
another O
plan O
to O
take O
everyone O
to O
the O
same O
place O
, O
which O
we O
know O
will O
fail O
. O

The O
difference O
is O
that O
those O
who O
use O
that O
route O
will O
have O
individually O
controlled O
climate O
, O
music O
, O
and O
seats O
. O

And O
they O
can O
eat O
or O
smoke O
if O
they O
choose O
. O

Aside O
from O
Gerald B-PERSON
Gordon I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
comments O
, O
you O
have O
Jay B-PERSON
Fissette I-PERSON
saying O
that O
we O
have O
not O
fully O
made O
the O
connection O
between O
land O
use O
and O
transportation O
. O

I O
'd O
say O
that O
most O
people O
have O
made O
the O
connection O
and O
that O
the O
one O
Jay B-PERSON
is O
proposing O
is O
just O
wrong O
. O

Then O
, O
of O
course O
, O
there O
is O
the O
apparently O
obligatory O
and O
generally O
clueless O
comment O
by O
Stewart B-PERSON
Schwartz I-PERSON
that O
such O
articles O
always O
seem O
to O
include O
. O

In O
this O
case O
he O
makes O
the O
completely O
unsupported O
and O
obviously O
wrong O
statement O
that O
the O
conditions O
cited O
in O
the O
article O
leave O
everybody O
worse O
off O
. O

If O
he O
wants O
to O
voice O
the O
opinion O
that O
the O
wrong O
people O
are O
making O
money O
in O
the O
wrong O
places O
, O
that O
's O
different O
; O

but O
the O
claim O
that O
everybody O
is O
worse O
off O
is O
patently O
false O
and O
weakens O
the O
rest O
of O
his O
arguments O
accordingly O
. O

As O
for O
conservation O
easements O
, O
do O
n't O
get O
me O
started O
. O

When O
hundreds B-CARDINAL
of O
organizations O
are O
founded O
to O
accept O
gifts O
from O
thousands B-CARDINAL
of O
people O
, O
then O
stories O
like O
Hyland B-PERSON
's O
are O
inevitable O
. O

If O
conservationists O
want O
to O
conserve O
land O
, O
then O
they O
need O
to O
raise O
the O
money O
and O
go O
buy O
it O
. O

That O
means O
that O
they O
will O
need O
to O
set O
priorities O
as O
to O
what O
land O
is O
most O
worth O
saving O
and O
give O
up O
on O
the O
idea O
of O
saving O
95 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
it O
, O
for O

. O

Or O
, O
we O
can O
come O
up O
with O
some O
method O
of O
providing O
continuing O
income O
to O
those O
that O
are O
already O
conserving O
the O
land O
. O

A O
one B-CARDINAL
shot O
, O
partial O
payment O
in O
the O
form O
a O
conservation O
easement O
can O
not O
possibly O
conserve O
the O
land O
forever O
. O

Even O
when O
land O
is O
publicly O
owned O
, O
we O
ca O
n't O
count O
on O
conservation O
continuing O

In O

what O

? O

re O
: O
infrastructure O
costs O
and O
newcomers O

all O
things O
being O
equal O
.. O
a O
newcomer O
in O
NoVa B-LOC
needs O
infrastructure O
to O
support O
them O
in O
not O
very O
different O
ways O
that O
- O
that O
same O
newcomer O
in O
the O
outer O
burbs O
would O
need O
similar O
infrastructure O
- O

and O
it O
IS O
the O
infrastructure O
costs O
that O
are O
much O
more O
at O
issue O
than O
density O
per O
se O
because O
discussions O
of O
density O
.. O
seem O
to O
always O
flow O
back O
to O
infrastructure O
and O
not O
focus O
on O
density O
itself O
as O
a O
good O
or O
bad O
thing O
. O

If O
a O
newcomer O
did O
not O
have O
enough O
money O
to O
have O
a O
garage O
on O
their O
new O
house O
- O
people O
would O
be O
up O
in O
arms O
if O
their O
property O
taxes O
were O
taken O
to O
pay O
for O
that O
new O
garage O

but O
apparently O
folks O
' O
views O
of O
this O
become O
less O
clear O
if O
we O
're O
talking O
about O
taking O
people O
's O
money O
to O
pay O
for O
.. O
say O
a O
new O
classroom O
.. O
or O
a O
new O
library O
or O
fire O
station O
or O
traffic O
light O
or O
widened O
roadways O
. O

I O
think O
property O
owners O
are O
willing O
for O
the O
most O
part O
to O
pay O
their O
fair O
share O
- O

but O
if O
the O
growth O
rate O
is O
high O
- O
where O
there O
is O
a O
huge O
influx O
of O
newcomers O
then O
we O
have O
significant O
money O
issues O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
our O
locality O
has O
to O
build O
a O
new O
school O
every O
year O
and O
I O
understand O
that O
Loudoun B-GPE
has O
to O
build O
several O
new O
schools O
every O
year O
. O

Schools O
are O
over O
70 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
our O
property O
taxes O
. O

Without O
proffers O
- O
our O
taxes O
would O
have O
easily O
doubled O
and O
then O
some O
not O
to O
mention O
what O
would O
happen O
to O
the O
elected O
officials O
who O
approved O
those O
tax O
increases O
. O

Everyone O
needs O
a O
place O
to O
live O

but O
I O
will O
point O
out O
that O
when O
a O
newcomer O
buys O
a O
home O
twice O
and O
three B-CARDINAL
times O
as O
big O
as O
the O
typical O
house O
in O
the O
outer O
burbs O
.. O
commutes O
solo O
in O
a O
-LRB- O
usually O
new O
-RRB- O
SUV O
50 B-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
a O
day O
and O
then O
expects O
folks O
of O
much O
more O
modest O
means O
to O
pick O
up O
the O
infrastructure O
tab O
.. O
that O
there O
will O
be O
complaints O
. O

`` O
Another O
way O
of O
looking O
at O
this O
is O
that O
if O
new O
folks O
had O
to O
pay O
their O
actual O
share O
of O
infrastructure O
costs O
- O
there O
would O
be O
less O
money O
for O
bigger O
homes O
and O
new O
SUV O
and O
long O
solo O
commutes O
. O
'' O

And O
when O
we O
have O
all O
taxpayers O
picking O
up O
the O
tab O
for O
these O
infrastructure O
costs O
- O
there O
is O
no O
incentive O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
new O
folks O
- O
to O
make O
conservative O
financial O
decisions O
- O

because O
, O
in O
essence O
, O
they O
are O
being O
subsididzed O
. O

The O
more O
that O
each O
person O
has O
to O
pay O
their O
own O
fair O
share O
of O

costs O
- O
the O
more O
it O
will O
impact O
the O
choices O
that O
have O
expensive O
consequences O
- O
for O
either O
them O
.. O
or O
for O
others O
. O

I O
pointed O
out O
in O
another O
post O
the O
problems O
of O
planned O
communities O
. O

There O
, O
the O
existing O
residents O
have O
not O
paid O
enough O
to O
support O
the O
common O
use O
land O
and O
common O
use O
infrastructure O
, O
with O
the O
result O
that O
these O
communities O
are O
now O
resorting O
to O
assessing O
additional O
fees O
, O
but O
only O
on O
newcomers O
. O

In O
this O
case O
the O
newcomers O
are O
not O
causing O
any O
new O
requirements O
, O

but O
they O
are O
still O
being O
expected O
to O
pay O
a O
higher O
price O
than O
existing O
residents O
, O
and O
for O
facilites O
that O
were O
worn O
out O
-LRB- O
by O
existing O
residents O
-RRB- O
before O
the O
new O
residents O
arrived O
. O

It O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
this O
exposes O
a O
critical O
weakness O
in O
what O
we O
psychologically O
view O
as O
fair O
. O

I O
would O
agree O
with O
Larry B-PERSON
if O
: O
a O
-RRB- O
existing O
residents O
were O
already O
paying O
enough O
to O
support O
existing O
infrastructure O
, O
which O
they O
are O
apparently O
not O
. O

-LRB- O
At O
least O
that O
is O
a O
widely O
held O
belief O
. O
-RRB- O

b O
-RRB- O
the O
additional O
costs O
-LRB- O
for O
proffers O
and O
such O
-RRB- O
over O
and O
above O
ordinary O
and O
sufficient O
property O
taxes O
were O
carefully O
examined O
to O
cover O
only O
the O
new O
and O
extraordinary O
capital O
costs O
associated O
solely O
with O
new O
residents O
. O

That O
means O
that O
you O
can O
not O
blame O
the O
new O
residents O
for O
increased O
capital O
costs O
that O
are O
really O
in O
support O
of O
new O
desires O
or O
needs O
on O
the O
part O
of O
all O
residents O
. O

Say O
crime O
is O
up O
50 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
so O
you O
need O
a O
new O
jail O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
new O
residents O
are O
planned O
to O
be O
up O
25 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
. O

How O
much O
of O
the O
cost O
of O
the O
new O
jail O
should O
the O
new O
residents O
pay O
? O

Are O
you O
going O
to O
hold O
them O
responsible O
for O
the B-PERCENT
50 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
increased O
need O
that O
is O
due O
to O
existing O
residents O
? O

I O
understand O
Larry B-PERSON
's O
point O
, O

but O
I O
think O
it O
is O
intellectually O
too O
easy O
to O
be O
correct O
. O

I O
particularly O
like O
this O
: O
Another O
way O
of O
looking O
at O
this O
is O
that O
if O
new O
folks O
had O
to O
pay O
their O
actual O
share O
of O
infrastructure O
costs O
- O
there O
would O
be O
less O
money O
for O
bigger O
homes O
and O
new O
SUV O
and O
long O
solo O
commutes O
. O

That O
is O
absolutely O
correct O
, O

and O
it O
corresponds O
to O
EMR B-PERSON
's O
gloomy O
prediction O
that O
we O
will O
all O
face O
lowered O
expectations O
. O

But O
what O
if O
the O
choice O
is O
a O
smaller O
home O
in O
the O
exurbs O
and O
a O
hybrid O
? O

It O
is O
a O
fine O
argument O
, O

but O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
we O
know O
anywhere O
near O
enough O
to O
actually O
and O
fairly O
assess O
the O
costs O
of O
new O
infrastructure O
, O
on O
the O
one B-CARDINAL
hand O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
if O
the O
newcomers O
pay O
for O
their O
own O
infrastructure O
, O
especially O
if O
we O
*require* O
them O
to O
pay O
for O
their O
own O
infrastructure O
, O
then O
we O
should O
not O
be O
too O
surprised O
if O
they O
claim O
to O
own O
it O
and O
wish O
to O
exclude O
us O
. O

This O
has O
already O
happened O
with O
some O
gated O
communities O
. O

They O
provided O
things O
like O
bike O
paths O
, O
and O
now O
the O
outside O
community O
wants O
connectivity O
to O
those O
assets O
without O
picking O
up O
part O
of O
the O
costs O
. O

It O
is O
the O
same O
with O
riparian O
setbacks O
and O
other O
increased O
demands O
on O
private O
income O
or O
property O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
see O
how O
we O
can O
expect O
it O
to O
be O
shared O
infrastructure O
that O
we O
all O
benefit O
from O
unless O
we O
share O
some O
of O
the O
costs O
. O

At O
present O
, O
we O
ca O
n't O
even O
agree O
on O
what O
`` O
some O
of O
'' O
amounts O
to O
, O
let O
alone O
if O
it O
is O
a O
fair O
distribution O
. O

What O
if O
the O
choice O
is O
between O
a O
larger O
home O
and O
an O
SUV O
in O
the O
exurbs O
or O
a O
smaller O
home O
and O
maybe O
no O
car O
in O
the O
inner O
areas O
, O
AND O
AT O
A O
HIGHER O
PRICE O
, O
including O
travel O
? O

to O
make O
way O
for O

re O
: O
newcomers O
/ O
infrastructure O
/ O
longevity O

Well O
.. O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
infrastructure O
`` O
wears O
out O
'' O
in O
the O
usual O
sense O
but O
I O
do O
accept O
the O
premise O
for O
some O
things O
. O

Roads O
and O
water O
/ O
sewer O
are O
not O
replaced O
. O

They O
are O
, O
instead O
, O
maintained O
. O

Schools O
and O
Prisons O
and O
other O
buildings O
can O
eventually O
wear O
out O
and O
need O
replacement O
. O

But O
I O
am O
talking O
about O
new O
infrastructure O
that O
would O
not O
be O
needed O
if O
an O
area O
was O
not O
experiencing O
growth O
. O

All O
communities O
have O
CIPs O
-LRB- O
capital O
investment O
plans O
-RRB- O
for O
infrastructure O
- O
both O
replacement O
and O
but O
replacement O
infrastructure O
IS O
something O
that O
can O
be O
accomodated O
in O
an O
annual O
budget O
- O
much O
like O
figuring O
out O
how O
many O
buses O
the O
school O
system O
needs O
to O
replace O
- O
every O
year O
- O

it O
's O
a O
known O
calculation O
. O

But O
new O
infrastructure O
is O
not O
because O
it O
depends O
on O
the O
RATE O
of O
growth O

and O
I O
think O
there O
would O
be O
strenuous O
disagreement O
with O
the O
claim O
that O
`` O

rather O
expensive O

Most O

Learning O
from O
the O
Swedes B-NORP

Reader O
Rob B-PERSON
Jackson I-PERSON
calls O
attention O
to O
an O
article O
in O
today O
's O
Wall B-ORG
Street I-ORG
Journal I-ORG
about O
the O
experiment O
in O
Stockholm B-GPE
, O
Sweden B-GPE
, O
with O
congestion O
pricing O
. O

It O
seems O
that O
the O
Swedes B-NORP
, O
for O
all O
their O
skill O
in O
urban O
planning O
and O
their O
investments O
in O
mass O
transit O
, O
are O
suffering O
from O
traffic O
congestion O
. O

Better O
yet O
, O
they O
're O
adopting O
a O
market O
- O
driven O
remedy O
. O

Socialist O
though O
they O
may O
be O
, O
Sweden B-GPE
's O
politicians O
apparently O
have O
a O
firmer O
grasp O
of O
economics O
than O
Virginia B-GPE
's O
. O

The O
Greater B-LOC
Stockholm I-LOC
region O
has O
nearly B-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
people O
. O

The O
central O
city O
, O
built O
upon O
an O
archipelago O
of O
islands O
linked O
by O
bridges O
, O
is O
particularly O
prone O
to O
congestion O
. O

Under O
contract O
with O
IBM B-ORG
, O
the O
national O
government O
has O
set O
up O
23 B-CARDINAL
tolling O
points O
which O
, O
used O
in O
conjunction O
with O
transponder O
boxes O
, O
laser O
detectors O
and O
cameras O
, O
tracks O
the O
path O
of O
every O
car O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Each O
time O
a O
car O
with O
a O
transponder O
passes O
through O
a O
toll O
, O
the O
charge O
is O
automatically O
deducted O
from O
the O
driver O
's O
bank O
account O
. O

Tolls O
vary O
at O
different O
times O
of O
the O
day O
according O
to O
the O
level O
of O
congestion O
, O
ranging O
from O
the O
equivalent O
of O
$ B-MONEY
1.38 I-MONEY
to O
$ O
2.76 B-MONEY
per O
hour O
. O

The O
goal O
was O
to O
alter O
motorist O
behavior O
-- O
and O
that O
's O
exactly O
what O
has O
happened O
. O

Rather O
than O
drive O
to O
and O
from O
work O
at O
the O
same O
time O
every O
day O
, O
some O
Stockholmites B-NORP
-LRB- O
Stockholmers B-NORP
? O
-RRB- O
are O
varying O
their O
commuting O
times O
. O

Some O
are O
taking O
different O
routes O
. O

Some O
are O
riding O
bicycles O
. O

And O
many O
are O
availing O
themselves O
of O
mass O
transit O
. O

As O
the O
WSJ B-ORG
explains O
: O
Before O
the O
trial O
began O
, O
Stockholm B-GPE
spent O
about B-MONEY
$ I-MONEY
180 I-MONEY
million I-MONEY
on O
improvements O
to O
public O
transportation O
. O

It O
bought O
about O
200 B-CARDINAL
new O
buses O
and O
added O
rush O
- O
hour O
trains O
, O
express O
bus O
routes O
and O
more O
park O
- O
and O
- O
ride O
lots O
. O

But O
the O
changes O
had O
little O
impact O
on O
the O
number O
of O
people O
who O
left O
their O
private O
cars O
at O
home O
. O

In O
spring B-DATE
2006 I-DATE
, O
however O
, O
during O
the O
trial O
, O
use O
of O
all O
forms O
of O
public O
transportation O
jumped O
6 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
and O
ridership O
on O
inner O
- O
city O
bus O
routes O
rose O
9 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
, O
compared O
with O
a O
year O
earlier O
. O

Now O
that O
the O
six B-DATE
- I-DATE
month I-DATE
trial O
has O
ended O
, O
the O
city O
has O
scheduled O
a O
referendum O
to O
let O
voters O
decide O
whether O
to O
make O
the O
congestion O
- O
pricing O
scheme O
permanent O
. O

A O
June B-DATE
poll O
found O
that O
52 B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
of O
voters O
favored O
the O
plan O
. O

So O
far O
, O
the O
idea O
of O
congestion O
pricing O
in O
Virginia B-GPE
has O
n't O
gotten O
past O
the O
talking O
stage O
. O

Oh O
yeah O
-- O
a O
system O
that O
tracks O
every O
car O
's O
movements O
through O
transponders O
will O
go O
over O
with O
the O
public O
in O
Va B-GPE
. O

There O
remain O
people O
who O
wo O
n't O
buy O

they O

to O

or O
their O

-RRB- O

It O
strikes O
me O
as O
remarkable O
that O
our O

are O
more O
socialistic O
than O
Sweden B-GPE

I O
do O
n't O
believe O
that O
the O
Swedish B-NORP

EMR B-PERSON

By O
all O
accounts O
the O
Stockholm B-GPE
experiment O
has O
been O
a O
success O
, O
so O
far O
. O

Three B-CARDINAL
issues O
come O
to O
mind O
. O

First B-ORDINAL
, O
Stockholm B-GPE
spent O
$ B-MONEY
180 I-MONEY
million I-MONEY
on O
transportation O
improvements O
before O
the O
experiment O
. O

Would O
the O
experiment O
have O
been O
as O
successful O
if O
they O
had O
not O
spent O
the O
money O
? O

Was O
the O
`` O
success O
'' O
a O
manufactured O
result O
to O
cover O
up O
for O
the O
previously O
failed O
investment O
? O

Second B-ORDINAL
, O
Stockholm B-GPE
had O
the O
presence O
of O
mind O
and O
the O
fairness O
of O
government O
to O
put O
this O
together O
as O
an O
experiment O
, O
and O
allow O
the O
citizens O
to O
dismantle O
it O
later O
if O
they O
thought O
it O
not O
worthwhile O
. O

That O
is O
an O
admirable O
approach O
, O

what O
US B-NORP
government O
has O
ever O
incorporated O
a O
policy O
as O
a O
test O
and O
THEN O
put O
it O
up O
for O
referendum O
? O

One O
of O
our O
problems O
is O
that O
having O
made O
a O
mistake O
, O
it O
is O
impossible O
to O
get O
the O
government O
to O
own O
up O
to O
it O
. O

Where O
is O
the O
referendum O
on O
whether O
we O
should O
spend O
umpteen B-CARDINAL
billion I-CARDINAL
on O
the O
Tyson B-LOC
's O
project O
? O

Focus O
groups O
and O
special O
interests O
do O
n't O
count O
. O

Third B-ORDINAL
, O
granted O
, O
the O
government O
in O
Stockholm B-GPE
has O
every O
incentive O
to O
spin O
this O
in O
a O
good O
light O
, O

and O
all O
the O
reviews O
seem O
good O
. O

I O
'm O
suspicious O
when O
no O
one O
seems O
to O
be O
able O
to O
find O
any O
shortcomings O
. O

In O
London B-GPE
, O
it O
took O
quite O
some O
time O
for O
the O
economic O
effects O
to O
sort O
themselves O
out O
and O
be O
measured O
. O

Although O
the O
London B-GPE
experiment O
also O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
success O
, O
there O
is O
considerable O
movement O
against O
it O
and O
the O
rapid O
rise O
in O

It O
does O
not O
seem O
likely O
that O
it O
will O
be O
repeated O
in O
other O
English B-NORP
cities O
. O

For O
the O
record O
, O
I O
'm O
in O
favor O
of O
congestion O
tolling O
, O
but O
I O
also O
think O
it O
will O
hasten O
the O
de-emphasis O
of O
central O
areas O
. O

In O
London B-GPE
there O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
distinct O
decrease O
in O
business O
just O
inside O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
congestion O
zone O
and O
a O
distinct O
increase O
just O
outside O
. O

It O
is O
too O
soon O
to O
see O
what O
happens O
in O
Stockholm B-GPE
, O

but O
the O
situation O
in O
stockholm B-GPE
is O
a O
lot O
different O
from O
London B-GPE
. O

Singapore B-GPE
is O
another O
example O
of O
effective O
use O
of O
congestion O
pricing O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
usre O
that O
there O
's O
much O
about O
Singapore B-GPE
's O
governmental O
philosophy O
that O
we O
should O
emulate O
-LRB- O
thinly O
disguised O
one B-CARDINAL
- O

-RRB- O
but O
, O
as O
someone O

has O
spent O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
time O
there O
over O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
20 I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
I O
can O
testify O
that O
traffic O
in O
the O
center O
city O
is O
much O
improved O
without O
any O
indication O
that O
economic O
development O
has O
been O
curtailed O
. O

In O
Southern B-LOC
California I-LOC
, O
there O
are O
at B-CARDINAL
least I-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL
tollways O
with O

pricing O
that O
fluctuates O
with O

The O

further O

let O
's O
think O
outside O
the O

here O

what O
makes O
`` O
congestion O
pricing O
'' O
- O
WORK O
? O

It O
's O
electronic O
tolling O
. O

`` O
congestion O
pricing O
'' O
is O
but O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
dozens B-CARDINAL
of O
possible O
outcomes O
based O
on O
the O
underlying O
technology O
. O

The O
privacy O
aspects O
are O
undeniable O
but O
the O
momentum O
towards O
electronic O
tolling O
is O
also O
. O

Right O
now O
.. O
they O
can O
`` O

you O
with O
your O

as O
well O
as O
red O

light O

and O
even O

in O

Electronic O
Tolling O
will O
make O
possible O
other O
methods O
of O
collecting O
revenue O
from O
vehicular O
travel O
besides O
congestion O
pricing O
. O

Obviously O
new O

/ O
expanded O
/ O
improved O

will O
also O
be O
possible O
- O
roads O
that O
we O
currently O
have O
no O
money O
for O
and O
unlikely O
to O
have O
money O
for O
in O
the O
near O

. O

Electronic O
Tolls O
present O
an O
opportunity O
to O
build O
new O
roads O
shortly O
after O
the O
study O
/ O
decision O
is O

The O
primary O
difference O
between O
this O
country O
and O
other O
countries O
' O
use O
of O
electronic O
tolling O
is O
that O
we O
're O
still O
thinking O
of O
individual O
roads O
whereas O
those O
other O
countries O
are O
implementing O
electronic O
tolling O
for O
the O
REGION O
- O
as O
a O
way O
to O
SHAPE O
the O
entire O
network O
's O
congestion O
. O

So O
.. O
think O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
entire O
NoVa B-LOC
area O
with O
a O
connecting O
network O
of O
electronically O
tolled O
roads O
being O
priced O
by O
the O
hour B-TIME
... O
and O
the O
place O
much O
like O
cell O
phone O
minutes O
. O

You O
have O
to O
admit O
- O
the O
cell O
phone O
business O
model O
does O
two B-CARDINAL
things O
very O
, O
very O
well O
. O

First B-ORDINAL
, O
you O
pay O
for O
when O
/ O
where O
and O
do O
n't O
get O
a O
free O
ride O

and O
second B-ORDINAL
, O
the O
cell O
companies O
collect O
enough O
in O
revenues O
to O
keep O
building O
more O
cell O
towers O
and O
expand O
coverage O
. O

think O
about O
the O
same O
model O
with O
roads O
and O
electronic O
tolling O
. O

Larry B-PERSON
, O
the O
cell O
phone O
analogy O
is O
brilliant O
. O

That O
is O
the O
logic O
of O
where O
the O
technology O
will O
take O
us O
-- O
if O
only O
politics O
do O
n't O
stand O
in O
the O
way O
. O

Either O
Nova B-PERSON
Scout I-PERSON
is O
right O
or O
Larry B-PERSON
is O
right O
. O

Congestion O
pricing O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
have O
limited O
Singapore B-GPE
's O
economic O
activity O
, O
but O
how O
would O
you O
know O
? O

For O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
, O
it O
's O
like O
traffic O
congestion O
: O

the O
demand O
is O
so O
high O
that O
even O
if O
you O
build O
new O
roads O
or O
throttle O
the O
demand O
, O
it O
is O
still O
high O
. O

For O
another O
, O
If O
Larry B-PERSON
is O
right O
and O
congestion O
pricing O
has O
shaped O
the O
region O
, O
then O
some O
of O
that O
economic O
activity O
is O
not O
happening O
where O
it O
might O
have O
otherwise O
. O

Transportation O
is O
very O
closey O
connected O
with O
economic O
activity O
. O

So O
in O
that O
sense O
, O
what O
tolling O
does O
is O
impose O
a O
tax O
on O
profits O
that O
have O
not O
yet O
been O
made O
. O

I O
think O
you O
should O
tax O
only O
income O
and O
sales O
, O
but O
I O
suppose O
you O
could O
rationalize O
this O
as O
a O
sales O
tax O
on O
use O
of O
the O
roads O
. O

I O
still O
think O
there O
is O
no O
reason O
to O
institute O
tolling O
except O
in O
special O
circumstances O
: O
Expensive O
bridges O
, O
and O
highly O
congested O
zones O
, O
for O
example O
. O

Otherwise O
a O
gas O
tax O
set O
high O
enough O
to O
do O
its O
job O
is O
still O
a O
fairer O
and O
cheaper O
method O
, O
and O
more O
environmentally O
friendly O
: O

the O
infrastructure O
is O
in O
place O
, O
and O
it O
automatically O
taxes O
by O
distance O
, O
weight O
, O
and O
horsepower O
. O

The O

This O
is O
a O
major O
`` O

'' O
moment O
. O

As O
we O
predicted O
, O
Route B-FAC
288 I-FAC
is O
generating O
residential O
development O
in O
scarcely O
populated O
areas O
all O
around O
its O

, O
overtaxing O
the O
local O

While O
the O

might O
provide O

for O

back O

between O

, O

and O
they O
are O
creating O
traffic O
congestion O
in O
new O
places O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
surprises O
me O
is O
how O
rapidly O
this O
is O
happening O
. O

Even O
I O
thought O
there O
might O

288 B-FAC

, O
the O
need O
for O

will O
soar O
. O

Before O
the O
end O
of O
the O

, O
we O
may O
well O
see O
the O
unfunded O

zoom O
well O
past O
the O
original O
$ B-MONEY
400 I-MONEY
million I-MONEY
it O
took O
to O
build O
the O
original O

To O
the O
brainiacs O
who O
thought O
Route B-FAC
288 I-FAC
was O
such O
a O
great O
idea O
: O

Thanks O
for O
nothing O
. O

I O
think O
we O
could O
have O
spent O
the O
$ B-MONEY
400 I-MONEY
million I-MONEY
better O
elsewhere O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
you O
can O
blame O
288 B-FAC
for O
creating O
those O
people O
. O

If O
there O
enough O
of O
them O
to O
create O
new O
traffic O
congestion O
in O
new O
places O
, O
then O
what O
is O
the O
alternative O
? O

Additional O
traffic O
congestion O
in O
old O

? O

Now O
you O
understand O
how O
people O
like O
TMT B-PERSON
in O
Fairfax B-GPE
feel O
. O

I O
'd O
usually O
take O
the O

position O

with O
the O
glaring O
needs O
in O
other O
parts O

288 B-FAC

excess O

You O
have O

when O

that O
you O
were O
n't O
on O
your O

from O
some O
sort O
of O

It O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
the O
whole O
point O

is O
to O
facilitate O
the O

getting O
to O

from O

the O

still O
, O
the O
overwhelming O
need O
is O
to O
support O
business O

Since O
our O
road O
expenditures O
nowhere O
near O
match O
the O
increase O
in O

or O

domestic O

, O
it O
is O
no O
wonder O
we O
suffer O
congestion O
problems O
. O

If O
we O
recognize O
that O
roads O
primaarily O
benefit O
businesses O
then O
we O
should O
do O
two B-CARDINAL
things O
: O

let O
business O
pay O
for O
more O
of O
our O
transportation O
bill O
, O
-LRB- O
which O
they O
will O
pass O
to O
us O
, O
of O

-RRB- O
and O
incentivize O
them O
to O
locate O
where O
they O
put O
the O
least O
stress O
on O
the O

, O
even O
if O
that O
means O
more O
overall O
travel O
. O

Why O
is O
it O
so O
hard O
to O
understand O
? O

The O
solution O
is O
functional O
human O
settlement O

a O

that O

be O

In O
other O
words O

they O

their O
wishes O

That O
someone O
else O
is O
a O

and O
maybe O
a O

They O
are O
in O
exactly O
the O
same O
boat O
as O
everyone O
else O
: O

their O
assessments O

their O

are O
going O
up O

Why O
are O
they O
going O
up O
? O

because O
all O
of O
the O
rest O

not O
paying O
our O

and O
because O
of O
demand O
that O

not O
in O
anyone O

control O
. O

Now O
, O
the O
assessments O
are O
based O
on O
what O
the O
land O
can O
be O
sold O
for O
on O
an O
unbiased O
exchange O
. O

How O
can O
we O
assess O
property O
on O
that O
value O
and O
then O
prohibit O
the O
sale O
? O

What O
NoSprawlTax.org B-ORG
is O
suggesting O
is O
that O
we O
bias O
the O

. O

If O
we O
do O
that O
, O
then O
we O
destroy O
the O
basis O
for O
making O
the O
assessment O
. O

Say O
the O
land O
was O
taxed O
only O
as O
its O
value O
for O
growing O
crops O
. O

That O
value O
is O
actually O
negative O
, O
in O
this O
area O
. O

At O
best O
, O
if O
NoSprawlTax B-ORG
had O
their O
way O
the O
tax O
collected O
on O
those O
properties O
would O
fall O
and O
everyone O
else O
's O
would O
go O
up O
. O

But O
to O
be O
fair O
, O
if O
we O
are O
going O
to O
eliminate O
all O
opportunity O
for O
those O
people O
other O
than O
the O
negative O
opportunity O
of O
growing O
crops O
-LRB- O
supposedly O
for O
our O
own O
tax O
benefit O
-RRB- O
then O
they O
need O
to O
be O
compensated O
, O

and O
our O
taxes O
will O
go O
up O
even O
more O
. O

Conservation O
is O
expensive O
, O

and O
what O
NoSprawlTax.org B-ORG
wants O
is O
no O
different O
from O
what O
they O
claim O
the O

something O

There O

99 B-PERCENT

Under O

nothing O

That O
is O

the O

What O
Anonymous B-PERSON

has O
n't O
figured O
out O
yet O
, O
is O
that O
special O
interests O
are O
actively O
working O
to O
make O
impossible O
what O
she O
has O
: O

they O
would O
prefer O
that O
there O
be O
nothing O
there O
other O
than O
undisturbed O
and O
unmaintained O
land O
. O

And O
she O
is O
making O
the O
same O
argument O
I O
have O
prevously O
made O
: O

some O
commercial O
development O
makes O
it O
possible O
for O
people O
to O
work O
near O
where O
they O
live O
. O

Sprawl O
, O
if O
you O
choose O
to O
call O
it O
that O
, O
makes O
it O
possible O
for O
more O
people O
to O
own O
and O
maintain O
, O
and O
pay O
the O
taxes O
on O
, O
what O
remains O
of O
our O
rural O
landscape O
. O

To O
the O
extent O
that O
occurs O
, O
people O
like O
her O
wo O
n't O
need O
to O
travel O
much O
farther O
to O
work O
and O
clog O
roads O
that O
are O
already O
overdeveloped O
. O

So O
, O
let O
's O
get O
off O
the O
schtick O
of O
blaming O
everybody O
else O
: O

it O
is O
not O
productive O
. O

Our O
officials O
are O
stuck O
with O
the O
unenviable O
position O
of O
balancing O
opposing O
interests O
. O

Nobody O
likes O
sprawl O

and O
everyone O
supports O
conservation O
, O

but O
it O
is O
going O
to O
be O
expensive O
to O
achieve O
goals O
we O
all O
say O
we O
want O
. O

Our O
officials O
are O
stuck O
with O
making O
their O
decision O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
any O
measurable O
criteria O
, O

and O
the O
special O
interests O
on O
both O
sides O
are O
so O
entrenched O
in O
their O
positions O
that O
someone O
will O
always O
be O
unhappy O
. O

I O
frankly O
do O
n't O
think O
we O
know O
anywhere O
near O
enough O
to O
decide O
what O
the O
best O
use O
of O
transportation O
revenues O
is O
. O

Even O
EMR O
says O
we O
know O
next O
to O
nothing O
about O
how O
we O
settle O
and O
live O
. O

We O
should O
be O
working O
to O
give O
our O
oficials O
tools O
they O
can O
use O
to O
dispassionately O
make O
decisons O
that O
are O
best O
for O
all O
. O

But O
using O
bad O
arguments O
against O
others O
that O
could O
equally O
well O
apply O
to O
ourselves O
does O
nothing O
to O
help O
the O
situation O
. O

We O
should O
spend O
the O
energy O
and O
money O
studying O
what O
works O
and O
what O
does O
n't O
and O
understanding O
why O
and O
how O
to O
measure O
. O

We O
can O
look O
at O
what O
works O
and O
what O
does O
n't O
and O
measure O
the O
characteristics O
of O
those O
places O
. O

We O
should O
duplicate O
the O
ones O
that O
work O
and O
not O
duplicate O
the O
ones O
that O
do O
n't O

And O
we O
should O
expect O

One O
thing O
we O
can O
be O
sure O
of O

that O

they O

they O
are O
bad O
for O

, O
the O
fact O
reamins O
that O
they O
are O
all O
sold O
to O

. O

When O
you O
look O
at O
the B-FAC
Ballston I-FAC
Corridor I-FAC
, O
those O
high O
rises O
were O
essentially O
subdivided O
from O
property O
formerly O
owned O
as O
single O
family O

. O

Those O

were O
sold O
because O
the O

could O
no O
longer O
hold O
on O

them O
at O
the O

being O

no O
different O
fo O

that O

I O
surely O
do O

the O

I O
do O
, O
however O

that O

to O
say O
`` O
no O
'' O
when O
they O
do O
n't O
think O
something O
makes O
good O
sense O
. O

One O
of O
the O
most O
refreshing O
experiences O
is O
to O
have O
an O
elected O
official O
honestly O
tell O
you O
that O
he O
/ O
she O
simply O
can O
not O
support O
your O
request O
because O
It O
's O
too O
expensive O
or O
because O
he O
/ O
she O
simply O
does O
not O
support O
the O
request O
. O

What O
I O
and O
, O
hopefully O
, O
quite O
a O
few O
other O
Virginians B-NORP
want O
to O
see O
is O
our O
elected O

walk O

. O

This O
problem O
flows O
from O
the O
top O
on O
down O
. O

Right O
, O
wrong O
or O
indifferent O
, O
Tim B-PERSON
Kaine I-PERSON
won O
office O
because O
he O
said O
`` O
we O
can O
not O
permit O
more O
development O
where O
the O

can O
not O
handle O
the O
traffic O
'' O

and O
`` O
we O
can O
not O
pave O
our O
way O
out O
of O
this O
mess O
. O
'' O

Yet O
, O
once O
in O
office O
, O
he O
jumps O
to O
the O
other O
side O
. O

Reasonable O
people O
can O
argue O
that O
Kaine B-PERSON
's O
position O
that O
would O
limit O
the O
ability O
to O
develop O
one O
's O
land O
was O
stupid O
or O
plain O
wrong O
. O

But O
we O
should O
all O
agree O
that O
his O
running O
away O
from O
the O
very O
position O
that O
put O
him O
in O
office O
is O
disgraceful O
. O

My O
engineer O
friends O
tell O
me O
that O
one O
can O
prioritize O
transportation O
projects O
based O
on O
what O
expenditures O
would O
produce O
the O
most O
improvement O
in O
traffic O
flow O
, O
etc. O

Yet O
, O
that O
's O
not O
how O
Virginia B-GPE
funds O
transportation O
infrastructure O
. O

We O
do O
it O
based O
on O
lobbying O
the O
CTB B-ORG
. O

What O
the O
NST B-ORG
map O
does O
show O
is O
that O
the O
goal O
of O
the O
sales O
tax O
referendum O
was O
mainly O
to O
build O
or O
expand O
roads O
near O
landholdings O
. O

That O
is O
not O
improving O
transportation O
, O
but O
a O
group O
of O
investors O
seeking O
a O
subsidy O
. O

-LRB- O
I O
have O
a O
good O
friend O
who O
attended O
a O
meeting O
in O
Richmond B-GPE
where O
a O
famous O
developer O
stood O
up O
and O
told O
the O
crowd O
that O
he O
built O
things O
and O
its O
was O
the O
taxpayers O
' O
job O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
infrastructure O
to O
support O
whatever O
he O
built O
. O

That O
's O
the O
Virginia B-GPE
way O
. O
-RRB- O

These O
landowners O
could O
offer O
to O
build O
or O
expand O
the O
roads O
near O
their O
properties O
. O

Look O
at O
the O
roads O
that O
Disney B-ORG
and O
others O
built O
in O
Florida B-GPE
. O

I O
do O
n't O
fault O
the O
landowners O
for O
trying O
. O

I O
do O
fault O
those O
elected O
officials O
who O
fail O
to O
say O
`` O
no O
'' O
to O
projects O
that O
would O
not O
fix O
traffic O
problems O
. O

My O
criticism O
is O
not O
just O
for O
roads O
, O
but O
also O
for O
extending O
Metro B-FAC
to O
Dulles B-GPE
at O
a O
huge O
cost O
that O
will O
not O
improve O

The O
table O
shows O
several O
roads O
with O
LOS O
F O
that O
, O
after O
spending O
billions B-CARDINAL
on O
Metro B-FAC
, O
are O
still O
LOS O
F O
. O

Fixing O
traffic O
problems O
? O

Hardly O
. O

Likewise O
, O
if O
we O
are O
in O
a O
transportation O
mess O
, O
why O
are O
n't O
our O
elected O
officials O
-- O
especially O
the O
Senate B-ORG
-- O
addressing O
VDOT B-ORG
's O
total O
lack O
of O
internal O
cost O
controls O
? O

Walk O
the O
talk O
. O

OK O
. O

Now O
we O
agree O
. O

Lobbying O
groups O
should O
be O
free O
to O
lobby O
. O

But O
they O
had O
better O
bring O
an O
argument O
that O
is O
supportable O
as O
in O
`` O
prioritize O
transportation O
projects O
based O
on O
what O
expenditures O
would O
produce O
the O
most O
improvement O
in O
traffic O
flow O
'' O
and O
not O
as O
in O
`` O
its O
was O
the O

' O
job O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
infrastructure O
to O
support O
whatever O
he O
built O
'' O
, O
and O
not O
as O
in O
`` O
new O
roads O
will O
do O
nothing O
for O
99 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
the O

'' O
. O

And O
officials O
should O
be O
free O
to O
say O
no O
when O
it O
does O
n't O
make O
any O
sense O
. O

That O
goes O
for O
lobbyists O
on O
both O
sides O
of O
the O
fence O
. O

Now O
, O
if O
we O
can O
just O
find O
some O
agreement O
on O
what O
does O
make O
sense O
.... O

I O
agree O
that O
Metro B-FAC
to O
Dulles B-GPE
wo O
n't O
do O
a O
thing O
for O
traffic O
congestion O
, O

but O
I O
'm O
not O
so O
sure O
it O
does O
n't O
make O
some O
sense O
by O
some O
other O
measure O
. O

But O
clearly O
, O
using O
tolls O
to O
pay O
for O
Metro B-FAC
-LRB- O
instead O
of O
road O
improvements O
-RRB- O
while O
simultaneously O
claiming O
that O
cars O
and O
roads O
do O
n't O
pay O
their O
way O
is O
both O
nutso O
and O
egregiously O
unfair O
. O

Those O
that O
benefit O
should O
pay O
, O
but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
we O
ca O
n't O
make O
egregious O
statements O
about O
who O
benefits O
, O
or O
who O
does O
n't O
. O

At O
some O
level O
, O
everybody O
benefits O
, O
but O
the O
benefits O
probably O
decrease O
rapidly O
with O
distance O
. O

Whatever O
formula O
we O
come O
up O
with O
is O
going O
to O
be O
complex O
, O

but O
we O
ought O
to O
be O
able O
to O
come O
up O
with O
something O
that O
is O
a O
-RRB- O
measurable O
and O
b O
-RRB- O
makes O
enough O
sense O
so O
that O
all O
but O
the O
nut O
cases O
can O
see O
the O
sense O
in O
it O

It O
's O
the O
reality O
of O

and O

The O
American B-NORP
public O
can O
adapt O
to O
the O
new O
global O
realities O
by O
changing O
their O
energy O
- O
intensive O
lifestyles O
, O

and O
politicians O
can O
help O
them O
by O
speaking O
honestly O
and O
forthrightly O
about O
why O
the O
price O
of O
gasoline O
is O
increasing O
, O
instead O
of O
demagoguing O
the O
issue O
for O
short O
- O
term O

. O

Here O
in O
Virginia B-GPE
, O
the B-ORG
General I-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
has O
been O
examining O
what O
Virginia B-GPE
can O
do O
to O
increase O
energy O
production O
. O

That O
is O
OK O
, O
as O
far O
as O
it O
goes O
. O

But O
there O
is O
nothing O
that O
Virginia B-GPE
can O
do O
to O
increase O
the O
global O
supply O
of O
oil O
, O
and O
probably O
little O
it O
can O
do O
to O
increase O
the O
petroleum O
refining O
capacity O
needed O
to O
convert O
oil O
to O
gasoline O
. O

What O
the O
political O
and O
business O
leadership O
of O
Virginia B-GPE
has O
so O
far O
failed O
utterly O
to O
do O
is O
admit O
that O
Virginia B-GPE
is O
acutely O
vulnerable O
to O
oil O
price O
shocks O
. O

Virginians B-NORP
consume O
more O
gasoline O
per O
capita O
than O
the O
national O
average O
, O
in O
part O
because O
our O
transportation O
policy O
is O
geared O
toward O
matching O
every O
increase O
in O
automobile O
travel O
with O
an O
increase O
in O
transportation O
capacity O
with O
no O
thought O
of O
modulating O
travel O
demand O
. O

But O
reality O
is O
a O
stubborn O
thing O
. O

With O
each O
increase O
in O
the O
price O
of O
gasoline O
, O
the O
bankruptcy O
of O
the O
old O
order O
becomes O
increasingly O
evident O
. O

Let O
us O
hope O
that O
Gov. O
Kaine B-PERSON
, O
who O
prides O
himself O
on O
straight O
talk O
, O
begins O
leveling O
with O
the O
people O
of O
Virginia B-GPE
. O

Jim B-PERSON
- O
You O
are O
right O
on O
the O
money O
about O
how O
capitalism O
works O
, O

so O
why O
not O
try O
to O
make O
capitalism O
really O
work O
for O
Virginia B-GPE
. O

The O
future O
in O
transportation O
belongs O
to O
the O
nation O
, O
company O
or O
person O
who O
develops O
the O
alternative O
to O
gasoline O
powered O
automobiles O
. O

Why O
not O
do O
everything O
we O
can O
to O
assure O
that O
future O
arises O
from O
Virginia O
? O

Rather O
than O
drilling O
for O
oil O
and O
gas O
off O
the B-LOC
Atlantic I-LOC
Coast I-LOC
, O
we O
should O
be O
offering O
enormous O

for O
comapnies O
and O
individuals O
who O
want O
to O
work O
on O
alternative O
fuel O

to O
locate O
their O

here O
. O

You O
can O
encourage O
R&D O
on O
alternative O

with O
grants O
and O
tax O

. O

AND O
, O
you O
can O
work O
to O
increase O

The O
one B-CARDINAL

They O
could O
double O
their O

without O
leaving O

Why O
has O
n't O
the O

applied O
to O

on O

? O

By O
all O
means O
explore O
for O

in O

. O

Jim O
: O
Speaking O
seriously O
here O
, O
many O

-LRB- O
including O
my O
own O

have O
already O
cut O

What O
then O
? O

My O

and O

are O
all O
within O
a O

already O
a O

We O

I O
'd O
trade O
the O

but O
it O

who O

what O
with O

being O
what O

So O
, O
I O
ask O

, O
what O
are O

hard O

to O
do O
? O

Andrea B-PERSON
: O
How O
about O
a B-MONEY

? O

If O
the O
GA B-ORG
repealed O
the O
unnecessary O
sales O
tax O
from O
last O
year O
, O
then O
the O
average O
citizen O
would O
pick O
up O
some O
cash O
. O

Or O
, O
the O
GA B-ORG
could O
actually O
cut O
the O
sales O
tax O

and O
you O
would O
keep O
some O
more O
of O
your O

. O

Check O
out O
how O
much O
the O
Republican B-NORP

want O
you O

it O
takes O
two B-CARDINAL
arms O

The O
only O
answer O
to O
cutting O
the O
cost O
of O

is O
settlement O
patterns O
that O
require O
less O

all O

that O

Why O

even O

Zone O
pricing O
is O
trying O
to O
do O
much O
more O
than O
reflect O
different O

. O

Take O
a O
look O
at O
the O

Assuming O
the O
general O
accuracy O
of O
the O
data O

differences O
in O
do O
not O
explain O
zone O

. O

Look O
at O
Arizona B-GPE
, O
for O
example O
. O

There O
are O
much O
higher O
transportation O

in O

around O
the B-LOC
Grand I-LOC
Canyon I-LOC
and O
much O
more O

in O
the O
Phoenix B-GPE

Yet O
, O
Phoenix B-GPE
prices O
tend O
to O
be O
signficantly O
higher O
. O

Ditto O
for O
taxes O
. O

From O
what O
I O
quickly O
found O
on O
the O
Internet O
, O
total O

the O
following O
four B-CARDINAL

However O
, O
both O

have O
average O

that O
are O
significantly O
lower O

either O

There O

probably O
less O

suggestion O
to O
follow O
a O

near O
Sabie B-GPE
downhill O
one B-CARDINAL
afternoon O

and O
my O
8 B-DATE

old I-DATE
daughter O
and O
10 B-DATE

son O

Down O
and O
down O
we O
went O
wading O
through O
the O
sparkling O
water O
, O
first B-ORDINAL
broad O
and O
shallow O
then O
narrow O
with O
deep O
pools O
. O

I O
'm O
certain O
that O
neither O
a.m. O
or O
myself O
will O
ever O
lose O
the O
sharp O
frozen O
second O
as O
'Nita O
put O
her O
head O
under O
water O
and O
then O
threw O
it O
back O
with O
her O
long O
hair O
and O
an O
arc O
of O
water O
saying O
youth O
and O
grace O
in O
perfect O
agreement O
. O

And O
sexy O
. O

Then O
more O
descent O
, O
sometimes O
through O
the O
jungle O
on O
either O
side O
to O
bypass O
falls O
. O

Now O
it O
was O
getting O
dark O
. O

It O
was O
cold O
. O

Sometimes O
the O
stream O
bottom O
dropped O
away O
and O
we O
fell O
in O
over O
our O
heads O
. O

There O
was O
whimpering O
from O
all O
except O
'Nita O
, O
our O
rock O
of O
unshakable O
womanly O
determination O
. O

Just O
as O
the O
last B-ORDINAL
light O
faded O
we O
made O
it O
to O
the O
place O
where O
a O
trail O
left O
the O
water O
and O
led O
back O
to O
the O
car O
now O
a B-QUANTITY

us O

Only O

had O

used O

was O
sent O
off O

find O
another O

which O
he O
did O

and O
although O
at O

one B-CARDINAL
of O
us O
had O
to O
do O
a O
step O
of O
5th B-ORDINAL

and O
then O
reach O
back O
for O
the O

the O
all O

before O
9 B-TIME

'Nita O
was O

in O

, O

the O

were O
glad O

be O
alive O
, O

a.m. O
spun O
his O

and O
I O
put O
off O

That O
was O
the O

now O

ah O

not O

-- O

just O
look O
at O
the O

for O

found O

the O
fact O
that O

to O

that O

oh O

how O
did O
that O

more O
to O
the O

why O

we O

why O
? O

of O

January O
1966 O
. O

In O
Nigeria B-GPE
a O
civil O
war O
was O
going O
on O
. O

I O
was O
a O
correspondent O
covering O
the O
war O
. O

On O
a O
cloudy O
day O
I O
left O
Lagos B-GPE
. O

I O
was O
driving O
along O
a O
road O
where O
they O
say O
no O
white O
man O
can O
come O
back O
alive O
. O
I O
was O
driving O
to O
see O
if O
a O
white O
man O
could O
, O
because O
I O
had O
to O
experience O
everything O
for O
myself O
. O

I O
know O
that O
a O
man O
shudders O
in O
the O
forest O
when O
he O
passes O
close O
to O
a O
lion O
. O

I O
got O
close O
to O
a O
lion O
so O
that O
I O
would O
know O
how O
it O
feels O
. O

I O
had O
to O
do O
it O
myself O
because O
I O
knew O
that O
no O
one O
could O
describe O
it O
to O
me O
. O

And O
I O
can O
not O
describe O
it O
myself O
. O

Nor O
can O
I O
describe O
a O
night O
in O
the O
Sahara B-LOC
. O

The O
stars O
over O
the O
Sahara B-LOC
are O
enormous O
. O

They O
sway O
above O
the O
sand O
like O
great O
chandeliers O
. O

The O
light O
of O
those O
stars O
is O
green O
. O

Night O
in O
the O
Sahara B-LOC
is O
as O
green O
as O
a O
Mazowsze* B-LOC
meadow O
. O

I O
drove O
up O
a O
hill O

and O
when O
I O
got O
to O
the O
crest O
I O
could O
see O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
flaming O
roadblock O
down O
below O
. O

Burning O
logs O
blocked O
the O
road O
. O

I O
slowed O
down O
and O
then O
stopped O
; O

it O
would O
have O
been O
impossible O
to O
have O
carried O
on O
. O

I O
could O
see O
a B-CARDINAL
dozen I-CARDINAL
or I-CARDINAL
so I-CARDINAL
young O
people O
. O

Some O
had O
shotguns O
, O

some O
were O
holding O
knives O

and O
the O
rest O
were O
armed O
with O
machetes O
. O

They O
were O
dressed O
alike O
in O
blue O
shirts O
with O
white O
sleeves O
, O
the O
colours O
of O
the O
opposition O
, O
of O
the O
UPGA B-ORG
. O

They O
wore O
black O
and O
white O
caps O
with O
the O
letters O
UPGA B-ORG
. O

They O
had O
pictures O
of O
Chief B-PERSON
Awolowo I-PERSON
pinned O
to O
their O
shirts O
. O

Chief B-PERSON
Awolowo I-PERSON
was O
the O
leader O
of O
the O
opposition O
, O
the O
idol O
of O
the O
party O
. O

They O
must O
have O
been O
smoking O
hashish O
because O
their O
eyes O
were O
mad O

and O
they O
did O
not O
look O
fully O
conscious O
. O

They O
were O
soaked O
in O
sweat O
, O
seemed O
possessed O
, O
frenzied O
. O

They O
descended O
on O
me O
and O
pulled O
me O
out O
of O
the O
car O
. O

I O
could O
hear O
them O
shouting O
' O
UPGA B-ORG
! O
UPGA B-ORG
! O
' O

On O
this O
road O
UPGA B-ORG
ruled O
. O

UPGA B-ORG
held O
me O
in O
its O
sway O
. O

I O
could O
feel O
three B-CARDINAL
knife O
points O
against O
my O
back O

and O
I O
saw O
several O
machetes O
aimed O
at O
my O
head O
. O

Two B-CARDINAL
activists O
stood O
a O
few O
steps O
away O
, O
pointing O
their O
guns O
at O
me O
in O
case O
I O
tried O
to O
get O
away O
. O

My O
African B-NORP
experience O
had O
taught O
me O
that O
the O
worst O
thing O
to O
do O
in O
such O
situations O
is O
to O
betray O
your O
despair O
. O

The O
most O
important O
thing O
was O
keeping O
still O
. O

Keeping O
still O
takes O
practice O
and O
willpower O
, O
because O
everything O
inside O
screams O
that O
you O
should O
run O
for O
it O
or O
jump O
the O
other O
guy O
. O

But O
they O
are O
always O
in O
groups O
and O
that O
means O
certain O
death O
. O

I O
had O
to O
cover O
all O
my O
weaknesses O
, O
hide O
them O
somewhere O
very O
deep O
within O
myself O
. O

This O
was O
Africa B-LOC
, O

I O
was O
in O
Africa B-LOC
. O

They O
did O
not O
know O
that O
I O
was O
not O
their O
enemy O
. O

They O
knew O
that O
I O
was O
white O
, O

and O
the O
only O
white O
they O
had O
known O
was O
the O
colonizer O
, O
who O
abased O
them O
. O

The O
ones O
standing O
in O
the O
road O
wanted O
cash O
. O

They O
wanted O
me O
to O
join O
the O
party O
, O
to O
become O
a O
member O
of O
UPGA B-ORG
and O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
. O

I O
gave O
them O
five B-MONEY
shillings I-MONEY
. O

That O
was O
too O
little O
, O
because O
somebody O
hit O
me O
on O
the O
back O
of O
the O
head O
. O

I O
felt O
pain O
in O
my O
skull O
. O

In O
a O
moment O
there O
was O
another O
blow O
. O

After O
the O
third B-ORDINAL
blow O
I O
felt O
an O
enormous O
tiredness O
. O

I O
was O
fatigued O
and O
sleepy O
; O

I O
asked O
how O
much O
they O
wanted O
. O

They O
wanted O
five B-MONEY
pounds I-MONEY
. O

Everything O
in O
Africa B-LOC
was O
getting O
more O
expensive O
. O

In O
the O
Congo B-GPE
soldiers O
were O
accepting O
people O
into O
the O
party O
for O
one B-CARDINAL
pack O
of O
cigarettes O
and O
one B-CARDINAL
blow O
with O
a O
rifle O
butt O
. O

But O
here O
I O
had O
already O
got O
it O
a O
couple O
of O
times O

and O
I O
was O
still O
supposed O
to O
pay O
five B-MONEY
pounds I-MONEY
. O

I O
must O
have O
hesitated O
because O
the O
boss O
shouted O
to O
the O
activists O
, O
' O
Burn O
the O
car O
! O
' O

and O
that O
car O
, O
the O
Peugeot B-PRODUCT
that O
had O
been O
carrying O
me O
around O
Africa B-LOC
, O
was O
not O
mine O
. O

It O
belonged O
to O
the O
Polish B-NORP
state O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
splashed O
gasoline O
on O
the O
Peugeot B-PRODUCT
. O

I O
understood O
that O
the O
discussion O
had O
ended O
and O
I O
had O
no O
way O
out O
. O

I O
gave O
them O
the B-MONEY
five I-MONEY
pounds I-MONEY
. O

They O
started O
fighting O
over O
it O
. O

But O
they O
allowed O
me O
to O
drive O
on O
. O

Two B-CARDINAL
boys O
moved O
the O
burning O
logs O
aside O
. O

I O
looked O
around O
. O

On O
both O
sides O
of O
the O
road O
there O
was O
a O
village O
and O
the O
village O
crowd O
had O
been O
watching O
the O
action O
. O

The O
people O
were O
silent O
; O

somebody O
in O
the O
crowd O
was O
holding O
up O
a O
UPGA B-ORG
banner O
. O

They O
all O
had O
photographs O
of O
Chief B-PERSON
Awolowo I-PERSON
pinned O
on O
their O
shirts O
. O

I O
liked O
the O
girls O
best O
. O

They O
were O
naked O
to O
the O
waist O
and O
had O
the O
name O
of O
the O
party O
written O
across O
their O
breasts O
: O
UP O
on O
the O
right O
breast O
, O
and O
GA O
on O
the O
left O
one O
. O

I O
started O
off O
. O

I O
could O
not O
turn O
back O
; O

they O
allowed O
me O
only O
to O
go O
forward O
. O

So O
I O
kept O
driving O
through O
a O
country O
at O
war O
, O
a O
cloud O
of O
dust O
behind O
me O
. O

The O
landscape O
was O
beautiful O
here O
, O
all O
vivid O
colours O
, O

Africa B-LOC
the O
way O
I O
like O
it O
. O

Quiet O
, O
empty O
- O
every O
now O
and O
then O
a O
bird O
taking O
flight O
in O
the O
path O
of O
the O
car O
. O

Now O
I O
knew O
the O
price O
: O

UPGA B-ORG
had O
demanded O
five B-MONEY
pounds I-MONEY
of O
me O
. O

I O
had O
less B-MONEY
than I-MONEY
five I-MONEY
pounds I-MONEY
left O
, O
and O
fifty B-QUANTITY
kilometres I-QUANTITY
to O
go O
. O

I O
passed O
a O
burning O
village O
and O
then O
an O
emptying O
village O
, O
people O
fleeing O
into O
the O
bush O
. O

Two B-CARDINAL
goats O
grazed O
by O
the O
roadside O
and O
smoke O
hung O
above O
the O
road O
. O

Beyond O
the O
village O
there O
was O
another O
burning O
roadblock O
. O

Activists O
in O
UPGA B-ORG
uniforms O
, O
knives O
in O
their O
hands O
, O
were O
kicking O
a O
driver O
who O
did O
not O
want O
to O
pay O
his O
membership O
fee O
. O

Nearby O
stood O
a O
bloody O
, O
beaten O
man O
- O

he O
had O
n't O
been O
able O
to O
come O
up O
with O
the O
dues O
, O
either O
. O

Everything O
looked O
like O
the O
first O
roadblock O
. O

At O
this O
one O
, O
though O
, O
I O
had O
n't O
even O
managed O
to O
announce O
my O
desire O
to O
join O
UPGA B-ORG
before O
I O
received O
a O
pair O
of O
hooks O
to O
the O
midsection O
and O
had O
my O
shirt O
torn O
. O

They O
turned O
my O
pockets O
out O
and O
took O
all O
my O
money O
. O

I O
was O
waiting O
for O
them O
to O
set O
me O
on O
fire O
, O
because O
UPGA B-ORG
was O
burning O
many O
people O
alive O
. O

I O
had O
seen O
the O
burnt O
corpses O
. O

The O
boss O
at O
this O
roadblock O
popped O
me O
one B-CARDINAL
in O
the O
face O

and O
I O
felt O
a O
warm O
sweetness O
in O
my O
mouth O
. O

Then O
he O
poured O
benzene O
on O
me O
, O

because O
here O
they O
burn O
people O
in O
benzene O
: O

it O
guarantees O
complete O
incineration O
. O

I O
felt O
an O
animal O
fear O
, O
a O
fear O
that O
struck O
me O
with O
paralysis O
; O

I O
stood O
rooted O
to O
the O
ground O
, O
as O
if O
I O
was O
buried O
up O
to O
the O
neck O
. O

I O
could O
feel O
the O
sweat O
flowing O
over O
me O
, O

but O
under O
my O
skin O
I O
was O
as O
cold O
as O
if O
standing O
naked O
in O
sub-zero B-CARDINAL
frost O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
live O
, O
but O
life O
was O
abandoning O
me O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
live O
, O
but O
I O
did O
not O
know O
how O
to O
defend O
my O
life O
. O

My O
life O
was O
going O
to O
end O
in O
inhuman O
torment O
. O

My O
life O
was O
going O
to O
go O
out O
in O
flames O
. O

The O
boss O
of O
the O
operation O
stuffed O
my O
money O
into O
his O
pocket O
and O
shouted O
at O
me O
, O
blasting O
me O
with O
his O
beery O
breath O
: O
' O
Power O
! O

UPGA B-ORG
must O
get O
power O
! O

We O
want O
power O
! O

UPGA B-ORG
is O
power O
! O
' O

He O
was O
shaking O
, O
swept O
up O
in O
the O
passion O
of O
power O
; O

he O
was O
mad O
on O
power O
; O

the O
very O
word O
' O
power O
' O
sent O
him O
into O
ecstasy O
, O
into O
the O
highest O
rapture O
. O

His O
face O
was O
flooding O
sweat O
, O

the O
veins O
on O
his O
forehead O
were O
bulging O

and O
his O
eyes O
were O
shot O
with O
blood O
and O
madness O
. O

He O
was O
happy O

and O
he O
began O
to O
laugh O
in O
joy O
. O

They O
all O
started O
laughing O
. O

That O
laughter O
saved O
me O
. O

They O
ordered O
me O
to O
drive O
on O
. O

About O
four B-QUANTITY
kilometres I-QUANTITY
down O
the O
road O
the O
third B-ORDINAL
roadblock O
was O
burning O
. O

The O
road O
was O
straight O

and O
I O
could O
see O
the O
smoke O
a O
long O
way O
off O
, O

and O
then O
I O
saw O
the O
fire O
and O
the O
activists O
. O

I O
could O
not O
turn O
back O
. O

There O
were O
two B-CARDINAL
barriers O
behind O
me O
. O

I O
could O
only O
go O
forward O
. O

I O
was O
trapped O
, O
falling O
out O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
ambush O
into O
another O
. O

But O
now O
I O
was O
out O
of O
money O
for O
ransom O
, O

and O
I O
knew O
that O
if O
I O
did O
n't O
pay O
up O
they O
would O
burn O
the O
car O
. O

Above O
all O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
another O
beating O
. O

I O
had O
been O
whipped O
, O
my O
shirt O
was O
in O
tatters O

and O
I O
reeked O
of O
benzene O
. O

There O
was O
only O
one B-CARDINAL
way O
out O
: O
to O
run O
the O
roadblock O
. O

It O
was O
risky O
because O
I O
might O
wreck O
the O
car O
or O
it O
might O
catch O
fire O
. O

But O
I O
had O
no O
choice O
. O

I O
floored O
it O
. O

The O
roadblock O
was O
a O
kilometre B-QUANTITY
ahead O
. O

The O
speedometer O
needle O
jumped O
: O
110 B-CARDINAL
, O
120 B-CARDINAL
, O
140 B-CARDINAL
. O

The O
car O
shimmied O

and O
I O
gripped O
the O
wheel O
more O
tightly O
. O

I O
leaned O
on O
the O
horn O
. O

When O
I O
was O
right O
on O
top O
of O
it O
I O
could O
see O
that O
the O
bonfire O
stretched O
all O
the O
way O
across O
the O
road O
. O

The O
activists O
were O
waving O
their O
knives O
for O
me O
to O
stop O
. O

I O
saw O
that O
two B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
were O
winding O
up O
to O
throw O
bottles O
of O
gasoline O
at O
the O
car O

and O
for O
a O
second O
I O
thought O
, O
so O
, O
this O
is O
the O
end O
, O

this O
is O
the O
end O
, O

but O
there O
was O
no O
turning O
back O
. O

There O
was O
no O
turning O
... O

I O
smashed O
into O
the O
fire O
, O

the O
car O
jumped O
, O

there O
was O
a O
hammering O
against O
the O
belly O
pan O
, O

sparks O
showered O
over O
the O
windshield O
. O

And O
suddenly O
- O
the O
roadblock O
, O
the O
fire O
and O
the O
shouting O
were O
behind O
me O
. O

The O
bottles O
had O
missed O
. O

Hounded O
by O
terror O
I O
drove O
another O
kilometre B-QUANTITY

and O
then O
I O
stopped O
to O
make O
sure O
the O

notice O

and O
a O

The O

that O
Abather B-PERSON

moved O
the O

`` O

Philip B-PERSON

an O

LEWIS I-PERSON

He O
's O
such O
an O
easy O
target O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
Jackson I-PERSON
. O

He O
makes O
even O
the O
weirdest O
of O
the O
weird O
feel O
normal O
. O

But O
unlike O
them O
, O
Jackson B-PERSON
does O
n't O
try O
to O
hide O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
is O
easily O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
most O
screwed O
up O
beings O
on O
the O
planet O
. O

Every O
time O
he O
checks O
in O
for O
yet O
another O
surgery O
, O
he O
is O
announcing O
to O
the O
world O
that O
he O
does O
n't O
know O
who O
he O
is O
, O
where O
he O
is O
going O
, O
and O
that O
he O
thoroughly O
loathes O
himself O
- O
at O
least O
the O
adult O
version O
. O

And O
for O
his O
remarkable O
honesty O
, O
his O
most O
unprivate O
confessions O
, O
he O
is O
subjected O
to O
one B-CARDINAL
public O
humiliation O
after O
another O
. O

Who O
among O
us O
rock O
throwers O
would O
have O
the O
courage O
to O
reveal O
about O
ourselves O
what O
Michael B-PERSON
has O
revealed O
about O
himself O
? O

Next O
to O
the O
towering O
monument O
that O
the O
unedited O
Michael B-PERSON

is O
we O
are O
telephone O

; O

next O
to O
his O
singular O
guilelessness O
and O
candor O
, O
we O
are O
the O
multitude O
of O
the O
prevaricating O
and O
pusillanimous O
. O

Everything O
Michael B-PERSON
has O
done O
and O
said O
during O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
20 I-DATE
years I-DATE
has O
been O
against O
his O
own O
apparent O
self O
- O
interest O
, O
beginning O
with O
unrelenting O
surgical O
assaults O
on O
his O
erstwhile O
good O
looks O
, O
to O
hanging O
his O
child O
-LRB- O
and O
crotch O
for O
that O
matter O
-RRB- O
out O
to O
dry O
, O
to O
entering O
details O
of O
his O
bedroom O
antics O
into O
the O
public O
domain O
. O

Like O
a O
typical O
Dostoievksy B-PERSON
character O
, O
we O
can O
not O
account O
for O
the O
behavior O
if O
it O
were O
n't O
for O
an O
apparently O
overriding O
need O
to O
confess O
and O
proclaim O
-- O
over O
and O
against O
what O
the O
outside O
world O
wants O
to O
believe O
-- O
the O
truth O
of O
who O
we O
are O
. O

The O
on O
- O
going O
spectacle O
of O
Michael B-PERSON
's O
increasingly O
bizarre O
conduct O
is O
his O
confession O
to O
the O
world O
that O
he O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
spectacularly O
psychologically O
- O
challenged O
dude O
. O

Like O
children O
who O
are O
incapable O
of O
dissimulating O
their O
basic O
wants O
and O
needs O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
's O
manner O
of O
being O
in O
the O
world O
is O
uncensored O
and O
spontaneous O
, O

and O
to O
such O
an O
unsuspected O
extent O
I O
propose O
he O
deserves O
to O
be O
considered O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
most O
authentic O
beings O
of O
this O
or O
any O
other O
century O
, O
and O
quite O
properly O
belongs O
to O
that O
exceptional O
society O
of O
authenticity O
- O
questers O
that O
would O
include O
Saint B-PERSON
Augustine I-PERSON
, O
Pascal B-PERSON
and O
Heidegger B-PERSON
. O

The O
facts O
of O
Michael B-PERSON
's O
life O
have O
been O
well O
documented O
. O

We O
know O
that O
by O
the B-DATE
age I-DATE
of I-DATE
25 I-DATE
he O
was O
on O
top O
of O
the O
world O
. O

Thriller B-WORK_OF_ART
had O
sold O
an O
unprecedented O
50 B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
copies O
and O
Billie B-WORK_OF_ART
Jean I-WORK_OF_ART
had O
become O
the O
musical O
drug O
of O
choice O
in O
every O
corner O
of O
the O
world O
. O

Not O
only O
was O
the O
song O
's O
momentum O
and O
tension O
brilliantly O
crafted O
and O
fused O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
's O
riveting O
, O
counterpoint O
choreography O
- O
which O
remains O
unsurpassed O
-- O
revolutionized O
the O
way O
we O
simultaneously O
look O
at O
and O
listen O
to O
music O
. O

Before O
disbelieving O
eyes O
, O
his O
torso O
, O
head O
and O
limbs O
supplied O
never O
- O
before O
- O
seen O
anatomical O
rejoinders O
to O
the O
notes O
-- O
like O
a O
guitarist O
filling O
in O
between O
the O
lyrics O
. O

But O
from O
here O
on O
in O
, O
it O
would O
be O
downhill O
for O
the O
genre O
's O
quintessential O
messenger O
, O
for O
Michael B-PERSON
could O
no O
longer O
sustain O
the O
' O
great O
lie O
' O
he O
was O
living O
. O

The O
child O
's O
' O
tin O
drum O
' O
was O
beating O
ever O
louder O
in O
his O
head O

and O
he O
intuitively O
understood O
that O
he O
was O
developmentally O
under O
- O
equipped O
to O
handle O
the O
adult O
pressures O
of O
stardom O
. O

Far O
more O
compelling O
than O
the O
promise O
of O
even O
greater O
fame O
and O
fortune O
was O
the O
example O
of O
Oskar B-PERSON
, O
from O
Gunther B-PERSON
Grass I-PERSON
' I-PERSON
The B-WORK_OF_ART
Tin I-WORK_OF_ART
Drum I-WORK_OF_ART
-LRB- O
1959 B-DATE
-RRB- O
, O
which O
tells O
the O
story O
of O
a O
boy O
who O
refuses O
to O
grow O
up O
, O
who O
, O
through O
his O
drumming O
, O
rejects O
the O
adult O
world O
and O
the O
horrors O
taking O
place O
in O
Nazi B-NORP
Germany B-GPE
. O

Like O
Oskar B-PERSON
, O
Michael B-PERSON
had O
witnessed O
firsthand B-ORDINAL
the O
abominations O
of O
adult O
behaviour O
and O
refused O
to O
sign O
up O
. O

From O
his O
earliest O
years O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
Jackson I-PERSON
was O
subjected O
to O
both O
extreme O
psychological O
and O
physical O
abuse O
at O
the O
hands O
of O
his O
status O
- O
obsessed O
father O
, O
who O
designated O
Michael B-PERSON
as O
the O
vessel O
into O
which O
he O
would O
mercilessly O
pour O
the O
acid O
of O
his O
unrealized O
ambitions O
. O

To O
this O
single O
end O
, O
Joe B-PERSON
Jackson I-PERSON
was O
ruthlessly O
single O
- O
minded O
. O

Michael B-PERSON
was O
terrified O
of O
him O
, O
whose O
mere O
presence O
could O
induce O
nausea O
. O

At O
the B-DATE
age I-DATE
of I-DATE
5 I-DATE
, O
the O
father O
yanked O
the O
son O
from O
his O
pail O
and O
sandbox O
existence O
and O
made O
him O
run O
Hollywood B-ORG
's O
grimmest O
gauntlets O
. O

The O
little O
mouse O
that O
Michael B-PERSON
was O
suddenly O
found O
himself O
in O
the O
rat O
race O
and O
quickly O
learned O
to O
hate O
it O
, O

and O
like O
Oskar B-PERSON
, O
who O
found O
respite O
in O
the O
beating O
of O
his O
tin O
drum O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
found O
solace O
on O
stage O
, O
performing O
his O
music O
. O

But O
the O
stage O
could O
not O
provide O
Michael B-PERSON
with O
immunity O
against O
the O
constant O
encroachment O
of O
the O
adult O
world O
. O

Listen O
to O
his O
rapid O
breathing O
in O
especially O
Off B-WORK_OF_ART
the I-WORK_OF_ART
Wall I-WORK_OF_ART
and O
Thriller B-WORK_OF_ART
: O
the O
staccato O
- O
like O
panting O
of O
a O
stalked O
animal O
, O
the O
desperate O
breath O
of O
human O
panic O
, O
and O
his O
small O
boy O
's O
voice O
hiding O
behind O
the O
mesmerizing O
slash O
and O
blur O
of O
arms O
and O
legs O
fending O
off O
an O
invisible O
attack O
. O

From O
one B-CARDINAL
track O
to O
the O
next O
, O
the O
lyrics O
are O
n't O
so O
much O
sung O
as O
frantically O
whispered O
, O
the O
vowels O
cut O
short O
to O
the O
quick O
. O

Michael B-PERSON
was O
announcing O
that O
he O
could O
no O
longer O
follow O
the O
course O
Father O
and O
Hollywood B-ORG
had O
staked O
out O
for O
him O
, O
that O
the O
disparity O
between O
his O
real O
self O
and O
the O
role O
he O
was O
thrust O
into O
had O
reached O
unsustainable O
incommensurability O
. O

Only O
the O
child O
within O
could O
save O
the O
defenceless O
adult O
from O
the O
depredations O
of O
the O
adult O
world O
, O

and O
from O
this O
point O
on O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
would O
reduce O
the O
project O
of O
his O
life O
to O
letting O
the O
world O
know O
the O
truth O
of O
who O
he O
was O
: O
a O
confused O
, O
fragile O
, O
lost O
soul O
in O
search O
of O
care O
and O
love O
. O

By O
the O
time O
Michael B-PERSON
had O
attained O
mythic O
status O
, O
he O
was O
so O
far O
removed O
and O
alienated O
from O
himself O
, O
he O
would O
have O
to O
shed O
, O
over O
a O
period O
of O
20 B-DATE
years I-DATE
and O
still O
counting O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
skin O
after O
another O
before O
his O
true O
self O
could O
begin O
to O
emerge O
. O

As O
we O
might O
expect O
from O
someone O
so O
radically O
self O
- O
estranged O
, O
the O
result O
has O
been O
nothing O
less O
than O
a O
metamorphosis O
. O

Michael B-PERSON

journey O
of O
self O

discovery O
is O
a O

the O

when O
the O

Now O
that O

been O

this O

The O

it O
all O
the O
more O
remarkable O
that O

its O

evoking O
the O

Georges B-PERSON

as O

can O

without O
any O
shred O

- O
describe O
Club B-FAC

as O
`` O
probably O
the O

on O
the O

both O

open O
to O
all O
. O

A O
quick O
tour O
around O
Club B-FAC

reveals O
the O
truth O
of O
this O
statement O
. O

Although O
the O
exterior O
is O
discreet O
and O
vaguely O
stylish O
, O
inside O
, O
beyond O

there O
is O
a O

The O
central O
area O
is O
patrolled O
by O

most O
of O
whom O
seem O
not O

the O
buzz O
of O
the O

-LRB- O
mostly O

with O
a O
surprising O
number O
of O

chatty O

lone O

The O

The O
problem O
here O
, O
the O
argument O
runs O

is O
that O
there O
is O
nothing O

This O
began O
in O
the B-DATE
summer I-DATE
of I-DATE
2002 I-DATE
when O
Sarkozy B-PERSON
, O
then O
Minister O

introduced O
harsh O

around O
rue B-FAC

Those O
he O
hit O
hardest O
were O
the O
independent O
working O

almost O
all O
of O
whom O
were O
native O
Parisian B-NORP

working O

known O
as O

These O

were O
also O

a O
form O
of O

The O
traditionelles O
of O
rue B-FAC
Saint I-FAC

found O
themselves O
driven O
out O
of O
the O
city O
centre O
by O
the O
harsh O
laws O
on O
street O

walking O
. O

Many O
were O
reduced O
to O
working O
out O
of O

parked O
at O
Porte B-FAC
Dauphine I-FAC
or O
Vincennes B-FAC
, O
hoping O
to O
pick O
up O

from O
passing O

. O

The O
newspaper O
Le B-ORG
Parisien I-ORG
reported O
angrily O
on O
the O
way O
on O
which O
these O
native O
Parisians B-NORP
were O
being O
driven O
out O
to O
be O
replaced O
by O

from O

Africa I-LOC
run O
by O
gangs O
from O
Kosovo B-GPE
and O
Romania B-GPE
. O

Le B-ORG
Parisien I-ORG
did O
its O
best O
to O
explain O
that O
its O
complaints O
were O
not O
driven O
by O
racism O
but O
that O
traditionelles O
were O
as O
Parisian B-NORP
as O
steak O

, O
cheap O
red O
wine O
and O
Gauloises O
cigarettes O
, O
and O
, O
when O
they O
left O

the O
city O
had O
lost O
a O
vital O
component O
of O
its O
underground O
culture O

The O

who O
had O
worked O
rue B-FAC
Saint I-FAC

Denis I-FAC
for O
nearly B-DATE
20 I-DATE
years I-DATE
complained O
in O
the O
press O
that O
, O
not O
only O
was O
she O
being O
driven O
to O
penury O
, O
but O
that O
the O
city O
was O
losing O
part O
of O
its O
essential O
character O
. O

She O
clearly O
hit O
a O
nerve O
; O
the O
likes O
of O

, O
it O
was O
argued O
by O
those O
who O
took O
up O
the O

defence O
, O
could O
be O
anywhere O
in O
Europe B-LOC
, O
from O
Barcelona B-GPE
to O
Hamburg B-GPE
. O

At O
stake O
, O
it O
was O
further O
argued O
as O
the O
old O
generation O
of O
whores O
began O
to O
leave O
the O
city O
in O
droves O
, O
was O
the O
very O
soul O
of O
Paris B-GPE
itself O
. O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
see O
this O
as O
a O
typically O
Gallic B-NORP
overstatement O
. O

It O
is O
a O
fact O
, O
however O
, O
that O
the O
history O
of O
prostitution O
in O
Paris B-GPE
is O
, O
for O
many O
, O
inextricably O
linked O
to O
the O
political O
fortunes O
of O
the O
city O
. O

This O
tradition O
can O
be O
traced O
to O
18th B-DATE
- I-DATE
century I-DATE
Enlightenment O
ideology O
and O
the O
rise O
of O
a O
new O
class O
of O
thinkers O
, O
the O
libertins O
, O
who O
were O
avowedly O
atheist O
and O
sceptical O
about O
all O
other O
entrenched O
beliefs O
such O
as O
the O
power O
of O
monarchy O
. O

During O
this O
period O
, O
the O
city O
swarmed O
with O
whores O
and O
to O
call O
for O
their O
suppression O
was O
to O
be O
in O
favour O
of O
Church O
and O
King O
and O
other O
superstitions O
. O

The O
growth O
of O
widespread O
prostitution O
in O
Paris B-GPE
was O
paralleled O
by O
the O
rise O
of O
the O
new O
literary O
genre O
of O
pornography O
. O

Much O
early O
pornography O
was O
entirely O
functional O
, O
providing O
a O

This O

Ovidie B-PERSON

with O
her O
book O

Manifesto I-WORK_OF_ART
, O
a O
polemic O
in O
defence O
of O
porn O

Ovidie B-PERSON
's O
big O
idea O
then O
was O
that O
everyday O
Parisian B-NORP
life O
had O
been O
invaded O
by O
`` O
porno O
chic O
'' O
- O
the O
use O
of O
pornographic O
imagery O
in O

and O
that O
this O
was O
a O
betrayal O
of O
the O
intentions O
of O
those O
who O
, O
like O
her O
, O
both O
used O
prostitutes O
and O
made O
`` O
real O

I O
was O
then O
writing O
a O
book O
about O
Paris B-GPE
which O
, O
among O
other O
things O
, O
set O
out O
to O
cover O
the O
underground O
sexuality O
of O
the O
city O

and O
, O
inspired O
by O
her O
call O
for O
a O
return O
to O
older O
Parisian B-NORP
traditions O
of O
sexual O
experience O
, O
I O
went O
to O
speak O
to O
Ovidie B-PERSON
for O
the O
first O
time O
on O
a O
chilly O
September B-DATE
morning O
in O
a O
cafe O
near O
rue B-FAC
Saint I-FAC

Denis I-FAC
. O

In O
those O
days O
, O
Ovidie B-PERSON
was O
tiny O
, O
pierced O
and O
dressed O
in O
black O
pyjamas O
like O
a O
junior O
Maoist B-NORP

She O
began O
by O
quoting O
the O
contemporary O
thinkers O
Jean B-PERSON
Baudrillard I-PERSON
, O
Georges B-PERSON
Bataille I-PERSON
and O
Guy O
Debord B-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
all O
in O
different O
ways O
, O
made O
the O
case O
for O
sexual O
freedom O
, O
and O
cited O
the O
popularity O
of O
porn O
in O
pre-Revolutionary O
Paris B-GPE
, O
before O
explaining O
her O
notion O
that O
, O
because O
it O
is O
based O
on O
a O
universal O
need O
, O
in O
the O
right O
hands O
, O
`` O
porn O
can O
set O
you O
free O
'' O
. O

Ovidie B-GPE
went O
on O
: O

pornography O
, O
she O
said O
, O
was O
about O
nothing O
more O
than O
the O
promise O
of O
human O
happiness O
. O

The O
physical O
and O
economic O
exploitation O
that O
are O
undeniably O
involved O
in O
the O
sex O
industry O
, O
she O
said O
, O
are O
wrong O
only O
because O
they O
are O
a O
betrayal O
of O
this O
original O
, O
quite O
innocent O
trust O
. O

The O
exploitation O
of O
women O
in O
particular O
, O
she O
said O

was O
a O
betrayal O
of O
the O
original O
liberating O
aims O
of O
18th B-DATE

century I-DATE
pornography O
. O

It O
was O
this O
egalitarian O
philosophy O
that O
Ovidie B-PERSON
claimed O
to O
recapture O
in O
her O
work O

This O
did O
not O
preclude O
payment O
: O
indeed O
quite O
the O
opposite O

`` O
I O
have O
sex O
for O
money O

Ovidie B-PERSON
said O
, O

'' O

, O
of O

that O
demands O
respect O

I O
met O
Ovidie B-PERSON
again O
a O
few O
weeks O
back O
in O
Neuilly B-LOC
, O
the O
posh O
part O
of O
Paris B-GPE
where O
she O
now O
lives O
- O
presumably O
having O
made O
a O
packet O
from O
her O
films O
with O
titles O
like O
Orgie B-WORK_OF_ART
en I-WORK_OF_ART
Noir I-WORK_OF_ART
and O
Lilith B-WORK_OF_ART

It O
was O
three B-DATE
years I-DATE
since O
we O
had O
last O
met O
and O
she O
was O
now O
a O
mother O

She O
was O
also O
a O
little O
heftier O
around O
the O
edges O
but O
still O
with O
a O
definitive O
view O
on O
her O
own O
activities O
and O
the O
present O
state O
of O
sex O
in O
the O
city O

`` O
The O
problem O

with O
Paris B-GPE

probably O

told O

`` O
They O

Parisians B-NORP

A O
place O

represents O
everything O

it O

not O

go O

have O
sex O
happily O

a O

It O

just O
gangsters O

The O

there O

that O
you O
read O
in O
Georges B-PERSON
Bataille I-PERSON

may O
not O
have O
been O
entirely O
true O

but O
they O
did O
correspond O
to O
some O
form O

Now O
it O
is O
practically O
impossible O
to O
have O
good O
sex O
with O
strangers O
in O
Paris B-PERSON

'' O

We O
talked O
of O
the O
vogue O

'' O

which O
was O
in O
vogue O
in O
Paris B-GPE
in O
the B-DATE
late I-DATE
1990s I-DATE
and O
- O
as O
famously O
documented O
in O
the O
memoirs O
of O
Catherine B-PERSON
Millet I-PERSON
and O
the O
novels O
of O
Michel B-PERSON
Houellebecq I-PERSON
- O
is O
far O
from O
being O
the O
naff O
and O
suburban O
activity O
that O
it O
is O
in O
Great B-GPE
Britain I-GPE
, O
was O
briefly O
the O
height O
of O
Parisian B-NORP
chic O

`` O
I O
know O
of O
some O
echangistes O
clubs O
that O
are O
still O
charming O

'' O
Ovidie B-PERSON
says O
, O

`` O
but O
really O
all O
that O
too O
has O
gone O

Catherine B-PERSON
Millet I-PERSON
is O
intelligent O

her O
work O
is O
boring O

And O
Michel B-PERSON
Houellebecq I-PERSON
is O
not O
Georges B-PERSON
Bataille I-PERSON
- O

he O
is O
really O
a O
moralist O
and O
his O
work O
does O
not O
celebrate O
sex O
like O
Bataille B-PERSON
but O
condemns O
it O
. O

So O
why O
read O
Houellebecq B-PERSON
or O
Millet B-PERSON
? O

I O
think O
the O
problem O
is O
political O
. O

French B-NORP
people O
despair O
of O
the O
future O
- O
which O
is O
unstable O
and O
dark O
- O
and O
they O
are O
too O
morose O
to O
have O
sex O
properly O
. O
'' O

The O
conversation O
moves O
on O
to O
a O
discussion O
of O
rising O
violence O
in O
the O
suburbs O
, O
a O
disintegrating O
economy O
and O
the O
lack O
of O
a O
political O
solution O
. O

But O
notwithstanding O
the O
prevailing O
gloomy O
moods O
in O
the O
city O
, O
individual O
Parisians B-NORP
still O
take O
a O
chauvinistic O
pride O

their O
horror O

They O
still O
lament O
on O

not O
only O
how O
the O

how O

over O

policed O

for O

it O

The O

Le B-FAC

the O
only O

cinema O
in O
the O
city O

, O
which O
, O
over O
the O
past O
few O
years O
, O
has O
been O
regularly O
preparing O
to O
close O
its O
doors O
for O
the O
last O
time O

This O
cinema O
stands O
at O
the O
top O
edge O
of O
the O
red O
- O
light O
district O
of O
rue B-FAC
Saint I-FAC

not O
quite O
in O

Over O

is O
a O

Most O
of O
the O
old O

in O
Paris B-GPE
were O
swept O
away O
in O
the O
1980s B-DATE
, O
victims O
of O
the O
booming O
video O
trade O
and O
the O
regular O
appearance O
of O
hard O
- O
core O
porn O
on O
mainstream O
television O
. O

Le B-FAC
Beverly I-FAC
somehow O
struggled O
through O
the O
1990s B-DATE
. O

Most O
of O
the O
customers O
who O
now O
come O
are O
visibly O
die O
- O
hards O
. O

Some O
of O
them O
looked O
too O
old O
to O
be O
even O
interested O
in O
sex O
. O

Perhaps O
they O
come O
for O
companionship O
and O
out O
of O
loyalty O
. O

Others O
look O
sinister O
and O
sheepish O
in O
equal O
measure O

Le B-FAC
Beverly I-FAC
has O
never O
been O
respectable O
- O
the O
atmosphere O
in O
the O
pitch O
- O
black O
salle O
de O
spectacle O
is O
tense O
and O
fervid O
, O
with O
more O
than O
a O
hint O
of O
real O
physical O
danger O
. O

But O
to O
visit O
this O
place O
, O
in O
all O
its O
sleazy O
glory O
, O
is O
to O
take O
a O
trip O
to O
a O
bygone O
era O
: O
a O
time O
- O
maybe O
this O
was O
the O
1960s B-DATE
or O
1970s B-DATE
- O
when O
showing O
sex O
in O
a O
public O
space O
was O
a O
real O
transgression O
and O
possibly O
a O
real O
thrill O
. O

These O
days O
, O
as O
a O
short O
stroll O
down O
rue B-FAC
Saint I-FAC
- I-FAC
Denis I-FAC
or O
through O
the O
back O
streets O
of O
Pigalle B-FAC
- O
where O
porn O
DVDs O
are O
on O
sale O
at O
knock O

down O
rates O

reveals O
the O
opposite O
is O
true O
. O

I O
left O
the O
Beverly B-FAC
intrigued O
but O
not O
quite O
convinced O
by O
Ovidie B-PERSON
's O
argument O
that O
writing O
or O
screening O
sex O
is O
in O
itself O
a O
genuinely O
subversive O
statement O
of O
wilful O
and O
unrepentant O
erotic O
intent O
. O

This O
may O
have O
been O
the O
case O
in O
the B-DATE
18th I-DATE
century I-DATE
, O
or O
even O
in O
the O
1970s B-DATE
, O

but O
, O
nowadays O
, O
I O
felt O
the O
vision O
of O
the O
writer O
Michel B-PERSON
Houellebecq I-PERSON
- O
who O
, O
in O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
his O
poems O
, O
brilliantly O
describes O
, O
with O
appalled O
precision O
, O
the O
deadly O
routine O
of O
the O
hand O
- O
jobs O
and O
peep O
- O
shows O
available O
to O
fit O
in O
with O
the O
office O
hours O
of O
the O
central O
city O
- O
was O
indeed O
a O
more O
grimly O
accurate O
vision O
of O
21st B-DATE
- I-DATE
century I-DATE
Paris B-GPE
. O

`` O
Our O
civilisation O
suffers O
from O
vital O
exhaustion O
, O
'' O
Houellebecq B-PERSON
writes O
elsewhere O
, O

`` O
We O
need O
adventure O
and O
eroticism O
because O
we O
need O
to O
hear O
ourselves O
repeat O
that O
life O
is O
marvellous O
and O
exciting O
; O

and O
it O
's O
abundantly O
clear O
that O
we O
rather O
doubt O
this O
. O
'' O

Paris B-GPE
is O
evidently O
no O
longer O
the O
capital O
of O
sex O

but O
it O
is O
mutating O
into O
something O
else O
; O
an O
international O
sex O

As O
I O
walked O
away O
from O
Club B-FAC
88 I-FAC
and O
then O
Le B-FAC
Beverly I-FAC
, O
it O
seemed O
to O
me O
that O
this O
theory O
explained O
the O
strangely O
drab O
and O
haunted O
faces O
on O
the O
whores O
I O
passed O
