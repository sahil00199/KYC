One O
day O
Samuel O
said O
to O
Saul O
, O
`` O
The O
Lord O
sent O
me O
to O
anoint O
you O
king O
over O
his O
people O
Israel O
. O

Now O
listen O
to O
his O
message O
. O

The O
Lord O
All-Powerful O
says O
: O
' O
When O
the O
Israelites O
came O
out O
of O
Egypt O
, O
the O
Amalekites O
tried O
to O
stop O
them O
from O
going O
to O
Canaan O
. O

I O
saw O
what O
the O
Amalekites O
did O
. O

Now O
go O
fight O
against O
the O
Amalekites O
. O

You O
must O
completely O
destroy O
the O
Amalekites O
and O
everything O
that O
belongs O
to O
them O
. O

Do O
n't O
let O
anything O
live O
; O
you O
must O
kill O
all O
the O
men O
and O
women O
and O
all O
of O
their O
children O
and O
little O
babies O
. O

You O
must O
kill O
all O
of O
their O
cattle O
and O
sheep O
and O
all O
of O
their O
camels O
and O
donkeys O
. O
' O
'' O

Saul O
gathered O
the O
army O
together O
at O
Telaim O
. O

There O
were O
200,000 O
foot O
soldiers O
and O
10,000 O
other O
men O
, O
including O
the O
men O
from O
Judah O
. O

Then O
Saul O
went O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Amalek O
and O
waited O
in O
the O
valley O
. O

He O
said O
to O
the O
Kenites O
, O
`` O
Go O
away O
, O
leave O
the O
Amalekites O
. O

Then O
I O
wo O
n't O
destroy O
you O
with O
the O
Amalekites O
. O

You O
showed O
kindness O
to O
the O
Israelites O
when O
they O
came O
out O
of O
Egypt O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
Kenites O
left O
the O
Amalekites O
. O

Saul O
defeated O
the O
Amalekites O
. O

He O
fought O
them O
and O
chased O
them O
all O
the O
way O
from O
Havilah O
to O
Shur O
, O
at O
the O
border O
of O
Egypt O
. O

Agag O
was O
the O
king O
of O
the O
Amalekites O
. O

Saul O
captured O
Agag O
alive O
. O

Saul O
let O
Agag O
live O
, O
but O
he O
killed O
all O
the O
men O
in O
Agag O
's O
army O
. O

Saul O
and O
the O
Israelite O
soldiers O
felt O
bad O
about O
destroying O
everything O
. O

So O
they O
let O
Agag O
live O
. O

They O
also O
kept O
the O
fat O
cattle O
, O
the O
best O
sheep O
, O
and O
the O
lambs O
. O

They O
kept O
everything O
that O
was O
worth O
keeping O
. O

They O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
destroy O
those O
things O
. O

They O
destroyed O
only O
what O
was O
not O
worth O
keeping O
. O

Then O
Samuel O
received O
a O
message O
from O
the O
Lord O
. O

The O
Lord O
said O
, O
`` O
Saul O
has O
stopped O
following O
me O
, O
so O
I O
am O
sorry O
that O
I O
made O
him O
king O
. O

He O
is O
not O
doing O
what O
I O
tell O
him O
. O
'' O

Samuel O
became O
angry O
and O
cried O
to O
the O
Lord O
all O
night O
. O

Samuel O
got O
up O
early O
the O
next O
morning O
and O
went O
to O
meet O
Saul O
. O

But O
the O
people O
told O
Samuel O
, O
`` O
Saul O
went O
to O
Carmel O
. O

He O
went O
there O
to O
set O
up O
a O
stone O
monument O
to O
honor O
himself O
. O

Then O
he O
left O
there O
and O
went O
down O
to O
Gilgal O
. O
'' O

So O
Samuel O
went O
to O
Saul O
. O

Saul O
had O
just O
offered O
the O
first O
part O
of O
the O
things O
he O
took O
from O
the O
Amalekites O
as O
a O
burnt O
offering O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

When O
Samual O
came O
near O
to O
Saul O
, O
Saul O
greeted O
him O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
Lord O
bless O
you O
! O

I O
have O
obeyed O
the O
Lord O
's O
commands O
. O
'' O

But O
Samuel O
said O
, O
`` O
Then O
what O
is O
that O
sound O
I O
hear O
? O

Why O
do O
I O
hear O
sheep O
and O
cattle O
? O
'' O

Saul O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
soldiers O
took O
them O
from O
the O
Amalekites O
. O

They O
saved O
the O
best O
sheep O
and O
cattle O
to O
burn O
as O
sacrifices O
to O
the O
Lord O
your O
God O
. O

But O
we O
destroyed O
everything O
else O
. O
'' O

Samuel O
said O
to O
Saul O
, O
`` O
Stop O
! O

Let O
me O
tell O
you O
what O
the O
Lord O
told O
me O
last O
night O
. O
'' O

Saul O
answered O
, O
`` O
Tell O
me O
what O
he O
said O
. O
'' O

Samuel O
said O
, O
`` O
In O
the O
past O
you O
did O
n't O
think O
that O
you O
were O
important O
, O
but O
the O
Lord O
chose O
you O
to O
be O
the O
king O
. O

So O
you O
became O
the O
leader O
of O
the O
tribes O
of O
Israel O
. O

The O
Lord O
sent O
you O
on O
a O
special O
mission O
. O

He O
said O
, O
' O
Go O
and O
destroy O
all O
the O
Amalekites O
. O

They O
are O
evil O
people O
. O

Destroy O
them O
all O
! O

Fight O
them O
until O
they O
are O
completely O
finished O
' O

So O
why O
did O
n't O
you O
listen O
to O
the O
Lord O
? O

You O
did O
what O
the O
Lord O
said O
is O
wrong O
because O
you O
wanted O
to O
keep O
what O
you O
took O
in O
battle O
. O
'' O

Saul O
said O
, O
`` O
But O
I O
did O
obey O
the O
Lord O
! O

I O
went O
where O
the O
Lord O
sent O
me O
. O

I O
destroyed O
all O
the O
Amalekites O
. O

I O
brought O
back O
only O
one O
-- O
their O
king O
Agag O
. O

And O
the O
soldiers O
took O
the O
best O
sheep O
and O
cattle O
to O
sacrifice O
to O
the O
Lord O
your O
God O
at O
Gilgal O
. O
'' O

But O
Samuel O
answered O
, O
`` O
Which O
pleases O
the O
Lord O
more O
: O
burnt O
offerings O
and O
sacrifices O
or O
obeying O
his O
commands O
? O

It O
is O
better O
to O
obey O
God O
than O
to O
offer O
sacrifices O
to O
him O
. O

It O
is O
better O
to O
listen O
to O
him O
than O
to O
offer O
the O
fat O
from O
rams O
. O

Refusing O
to O
obey O
is O
as O
bad O
as O
the O
sin O
of O
sorcery O
. O

Being O
stubborn O
and O
doing O
what O
you O
want O
is O
like O
the O
sin O
of O
worshiping O
idols O
. O

You O
refused O
to O
obey O
the O
Lord O
's O
command O
, O
so O
he O
now O
refuses O
to O
accept O
you O
as O
king O
. O
'' O

Then O
Saul O
said O
to O
Samuel O
, O
`` O
I O
have O
sinned O
. O

I O
did O
not O
obey O
the O
Lord O
's O
commands O
, O
and O
I O
did O
not O
do O
what O
you O
told O
me O
. O

I O
was O
afraid O
of O
the O
people O
, O
and O
I O
did O
what O
they O
said O
. O

Now O
I O
beg O
you O
, O
forgive O
me O
for O
doing O
this O
sin O
. O

Come O
back O
with O
me O
, O
so O
I O
may O
worship O
the O
Lord O
. O
'' O

But O
Samuel O
said O
to O
Saul O
, O
`` O
I O
wo O
n't O
go O
back O
with O
you O
. O

You O
rejected O
the O
Lord O
's O
command O
, O
and O
now O
he O
rejects O
you O
as O
king O
of O
Israel O
. O
'' O

When O
Samuel O
turned O
to O
leave O
, O
Saul O
caught O
Samuel O
's O
robe O
. O

The O
robe O
tore O
. O

Samuel O
said O
to O
Saul O
, O
`` O
Just O
as O
you O
tore O
my O
robe O
, O
the O
Lord O
has O
torn O
the O
kingdom O
of O
Israel O
from O
you O
today O
. O

The O
Lord O
has O
given O
the O
kingdom O
to O
one O
of O
your O
friends O
. O

This O
man O
is O
a O
better O
person O
than O
you O
are O
. O

The O
Lord O
is O
the O
God O
of O
Israel O
. O

He O
lives O
forever O
. O

He O
does O
not O
lie O
or O
change O
his O
mind O
. O

He O
is O
not O
like O
a O
man O
who O
changes O
his O
mind O
. O
'' O

Saul O
answered O
, O
`` O
All O
right O
, O
I O
sinned O
! O

But O
please O
come O
back O
with O
me O
. O

Show O
me O
some O
respect O
in O
front O
of O
the O
leaders O
and O
the O
Israelites O
. O

Come O
back O
with O
me O
so O
that O
I O
may O
worship O
the O
Lord O
your O
God O
. O
'' O

Samuel O
went O
back O
with O
Saul O
, O
and O
Saul O
worshiped O
the O
Lord O
. O

Samuel O
said O
, O
`` O
Bring O
King O
Agag O
of O
the O
Amalekites O
to O
me O
. O
'' O

Agag O
came O
to O
Samuel O
. O

Agag O
was O
tied O
with O
chains O
and O
thought O
, O
`` O
Surely O
he O
wo O
n't O
kill O
me O
. O
'' O

But O
Samuel O
said O
to O
Agag O
, O
`` O
Your O
sword O
took O
babies O
from O
their O
mothers O
. O

So O
now O
, O
your O
mother O
will O
have O
no O
children O
. O
'' O

And O
Samuel O
cut O
Agag O
to O
pieces O
before O
the O
Lord O
at O
Gilgal O
. O

Then O
Samuel O
left O
and O
went O
to O
Ramah O
. O

And O
Saul O
went O
up O
to O
his O
home O
in O
Gibeah O
. O

After O
that O
, O
Samuel O
never O
saw O
Saul O
again O
. O

Samuel O
was O
very O
sad O
for O
Saul O
. O

And O
the O
Lord O
was O
very O
sorry O
that O
he O
had O
made O
Saul O
king O
of O
Israel O
. O

The O
people O
of O
Ziph O
went O
to O
see O
Saul O
at O
Gibeah O
and O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
David O
is O
hiding O
on O
Hakilah O
Hill O
, O
across O
from O
Jeshimon O
. O
'' O

Saul O
gathered O
3000 O
of O
the O
best O
soldiers O
in O
Israel O
and O
went O
down O
to O
the O
desert O
of O
Ziph O
to O
search O
for O
David O
in O
the O
desert O
of O
Ziph O
. O

Saul O
set O
up O
his O
camp O
by O
the O
road O
at O
Hakilah O
Hill O
, O
across O
from O
Jeshimon O
. O

David O
was O
out O
in O
the O
desert O
and O
saw O
that O
Saul O
had O
come O
out O
into O
the O
desert O
after O
him O
. O

So O
David O
sent O
out O
spies O
to O
know O
for O
certain O
that O
Saul O
had O
come O
after O
him O
again O
. O

Then O
David O
went O
to O
where O
Saul O
had O
set O
up O
his O
camp O
. O

David O
saw O
where O
Saul O
and O
Abner O
were O
sleeping O
. O

-LRB- O
Abner O
son O
of O
Ner O
was O
the O
commander O
of O
Saul O
's O
army O
. O
-RRB- O

Saul O
was O
sleeping O
in O
the O
center O
of O
a O
circle O
of O
men O
that O
surrounded O
him O
. O

David O
talked O
to O
Ahimelech O
the O
Hittite O
and O
Abishai O
son O
of O
Zeruiah O
. O

-LRB- O
Abishai O
was O
Joab O
's O
brother O
. O
-RRB- O

He O
asked O
them O
, O
`` O
Who O
would O
like O
to O
go O
down O
into O
the O
camp O
with O
me O
after O
Saul O
? O
'' O

Abishai O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
'll O
go O
with O
you O
. O
'' O

When O
night O
came O
, O
David O
and O
Abishai O
went O
into O
Saul O
's O
camp O
. O

Saul O
was O
asleep O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
circle O
of O
men O
. O

His O
spear O
was O
stuck O
in O
the O
ground O
near O
his O
head O
. O

Abner O
and O
the O
other O
soldiers O
were O
asleep O
around O
Saul O
. O

Abishai O
said O
to O
David O
, O
`` O
Today O
God O
has O
given O
your O
enemy O
to O
you O
. O

Let O
me O
pin O
Saul O
to O
the O
ground O
with O
his O
spear O
. O

I O
'll O
only O
do O
it O
once O
! O
'' O

But O
David O
said O
to O
Abishai O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
kill O
Saul O
! O

Anyone O
who O
hurts O
the O
Lord O
's O
chosen O
king O
must O
be O
punished O
. O

As O
surely O
as O
the O
Lord O
lives O
, O
the O
Lord O
himself O
will O
punish O
Saul O
. O

Maybe O
Saul O
will O
die O
naturally O
or O
maybe O
he O
will O
be O
killed O
in O
battle O
. O

But O
I O
pray O
that O
the O
Lord O
never O
lets O
me O
hurt O
the O
Lord O
's O
chosen O
king O
. O

Now O
pick O
up O
the O
spear O
and O
water O
jug O
by O
Saul O
's O
head O
and O
then O
let O
's O
go O
. O
'' O

So O
David O
took O
the O
spear O
and O
water O
jug O
that O
were O
near O
Saul O
's O
head O
, O
and O
then O
David O
and O
Abishai O
left O
Saul O
's O
camp O
. O

No O
one O
knew O
what O
had O
happened O
. O

No O
one O
saw O
it O
. O

No O
one O
even O
woke O
up O
. O

Saul O
and O
all O
of O
his O
soldiers O
slept O
because O
the O
Lord O
had O
put O
them O
into O
a O
deep O
sleep O
. O

David O
crossed O
over O
to O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
valley O
. O

He O
stood O
on O
top O
of O
the O
mountain O
across O
the O
valley O
from O
Saul O
's O
camp O
. O

David O
and O
Saul O
's O
camp O
were O
far O
apart O
. O

David O
shouted O
to O
the O
army O
and O
to O
Abner O
son O
of O
Ner O
, O
`` O
Answer O
me O
, O
Abner O
! O
'' O

Abner O
answered O
, O
`` O
Who O
are O
you O
? O

Why O
are O
you O
calling O
the O
king O
? O
'' O

David O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
are O
an O
important O
man O
, O
are O
n't O
you O
? O

You O
are O
better O
than O
any O
other O
man O
in O
Israel O
. O

Is O
that O
right O
? O

So O
why O
did O
n't O
you O
guard O
your O
master O
, O
the O
king O
? O

An O
ordinary O
man O
came O
into O
your O
camp O
to O
kill O
your O
master O
, O
the O
king O
. O

You O
made O
a O
big O
mistake O
. O

As O
surely O
as O
the O
Lord O
is O
alive O
, O
you O
and O
your O
men O
should O
die O
, O
because O
you O
did O
n't O
protect O
your O
master O
, O
the O
Lord O
's O
chosen O
king O
. O

Look O
for O
the O
king O
's O
spear O
and O
the O
water O
jug O
that O
was O
near O
Saul O
's O
head O
. O

Where O
are O
they O
? O
'' O

Saul O
knew O
David O
's O
voice O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Is O
that O
your O
voice O
, O
David O
my O
son O
? O
'' O

David O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
it O
is O
my O
voice O
, O
my O
lord O
the O
king O
. O

Sir O
, O
why O
are O
you O
chasing O
me O
? O

What O
wrong O
have O
I O
done O
? O

What O
am O
I O
guilty O
of O
? O

My O
lord O
the O
king O
, O
listen O
to O
me O
. O

If O
the O
Lord O
caused O
you O
to O
be O
angry O
with O
me O
, O
let O
him O
accept O
an O
offering O
. O

But O
if O
men O
caused O
you O
to O
be O
angry O
with O
me O
, O
I O
ask O
the O
Lord O
to O
curse O
them O
because O
they O
forced O
me O
to O
leave O
the O
land O
that O
the O
Lord O
gave O
me O
and O
told O
me O
to O
go O
serve O
other O
gods O
. O

Now O
do O
n't O
make O
me O
die O
far O
away O
from O
the O
Lord O
's O
presence O
. O

The O
king O
of O
Israel O
has O
come O
out O
looking O
for O
a O
flea O
. O

You O
are O
like O
a O
man O
hunting O
partridges O
in O
the O
mountains O
. O
'' O

Then O
Saul O
said O
, O
`` O
David O
, O
my O
son O
! O

I O
have O
sinned O

Come O
back O

Today O
you O
showed O
me O
that O
my O
life O
is O
important O

you O

so O
I O
wo O
n't O
try O
to O
hurt O
you O
. O

I O
have O
acted O
foolishly O
. O

I O
have O
made O
a O
big O
mistake O
. O
'' O

David O
answered O
, O
`` O
Here O
is O
the O
king O
's O
spear O
. O

Let O
one O
of O
your O
young O
men O
come O
here O
and O
get O
it O
. O

The O
Lord O
pays O
every O
man O
for O
what O
he O
does O
-- O
he O
rewards O
him O
if O
he O
does O
right O
, O
and O
he O
punishes O
him O
if O
he O
does O
wrong O
. O

The O
Lord O
gave O
you O
to O
me O
today O
, O
but O
I O
would O
n't O
hurt O
his O
chosen O
king O
. O

Today O
I O
showed O
you O
that O
your O
life O
is O
important O
to O
me O
. O

In O
the O
same O
way O
the O
Lord O
will O
show O
that O
my O
life O
is O
important O
to O
him O
. O

He O
will O
save O
me O
from O
every O
trouble O
. O
'' O

Then O
Saul O
said O
to O
David O
, O
`` O
God O
bless O
you O
, O
David O
my O
son O
. O

You O
will O
do O
great O
things O
and O
you O
will O
win O
. O
'' O

David O
went O
on O
his O
way O
, O
and O
Saul O
went O
back O
home O
. O

Samuel O
died O
. O

All O
the O
Israelites O
met O
together O
and O
mourned O
his O
death O
. O

They O
buried O
him O
at O
his O
home O
in O
Ramah O
. O

Then O
David O
moved O
to O
the O
Desert O
of O
Maon O
. O

There O
was O
a O
very O
rich O
man O
living O
in O
Maon O
. O

He O
had O
3000 O
sheep O
and O
1000 O
goats O
. O

That O
man O
was O
in O
Carmel O
taking O
care O
of O
some O
business O
. O

He O
went O
there O
to O
cut O
the O
wool O
from O
his O
sheep O
. O

This O
man O
's O
name O
was O
Nabal O
. O

He O
was O
from O
Caleb O
's O
family O
. O

Nabal O
's O
wife O
was O
named O
Abigail O
. O

She O
was O
a O
wise O
and O
beautiful O
woman O
, O
but O
Nabal O
was O
a O
mean O
and O
cruel O
man O
. O

David O
was O
in O
the O
desert O
when O
he O
heard O
that O
Nabal O
was O
cutting O
the O
wool O
from O
his O
sheep O
. O

David O
sent O
ten O
young O
men O
to O
talk O
to O
Nabal O
. O

He O
told O
them O
, O
`` O
Go O
to O
Carmel O
. O

Find O
Nabal O
and O
tell O
him O
' O
Hello O
' O
for O
me O
. O
'' O

David O
gave O
them O
this O
message O
for O
Nabal O
: O
`` O
May O
you O
and O
your O
family O
be O
well O
and O
all O
that O
you O
own O
be O
well O
. O

I O
heard O
that O
you O
are O
cutting O
wool O
from O
your O
sheep O
. O

Your O
shepherds O
were O
with O
us O
for O
a O
while O
, O
and O
we O
did O
nothing O
wrong O
to O
them O
. O

We O
never O
took O
anything O
from O
your O
shepherds O
while O
they O
were O
at O
Carmel O
. O

Ask O
your O
servants O
and O
they O
will O
tell O
you O
this O
is O
true O
. O

Please O
be O
kind O
to O
my O
young O
men O
. O

We O
come O
to O
you O
now O
, O
at O
this O
happy O
time O
. O

Please O
give O
these O
young O
men O
anything O
you O
can O
. O

Please O
do O
this O
for O
me O
, O
your O
friend O
David O
. O
'' O

David O
's O
men O
went O
to O
Nabal O
. O

They O
gave O
his O
message O
to O
Nabal O
, O
but O
Nabal O
said O
, O
`` O
Who O
is O
David O
? O

Who O
is O
this O
son O
of O
Jesse O
? O

There O
are O
many O
slaves O
who O
have O
run O
away O
from O
their O
masters O
these O
days O
. O

I O
have O
bread O
and O
water O
, O
and O
I O
have O
the O
meat O
I O
killed O
for O
my O
servants O
who O
cut O
the O
wool O
from O
my O
sheep O
. O

But O
I O
wo O
n't O
give O
them O
to O
men O
I O
do O
n't O
even O
know O
. O
'' O

David O
's O
men O
went O
back O
and O
told O
him O
everything O
that O
Nabal O
had O
said O
. O

David O
's O
response O
was O
, O
`` O
Put O
on O
your O
swords O
. O
'' O

So O
David O
and O
his O
men O
put O
on O
their O
swords O
. O

About O
400 O
men O
went O
with O
David O
while O
200 O
of O
them O
stayed O
with O
the O
supplies O
. O

One O
of O
Nabal O
's O
servants O
spoke O
to O
Nabal O
's O
wife O
Abigail O
. O

The O
servant O
said O
, O
`` O
David O
sent O
messengers O
from O
the O
desert O
to O
meet O
our O
master O
, O
but O
Nabal O
was O
rude O
to O
them O
. O

These O
men O
were O
very O
good O
to O
us O
while O
we O
were O
out O
in O
the O
fields O
with O
the O
sheep O
. O

David O
's O
men O
were O
with O
us O
the O
whole O
time O
, O
and O
they O
never O
did O
anything O
wrong O
to O
us O
. O

They O
did O
not O
take O
anything O
from O
us O
. O

His O
men O
protected O
us O
night O
and O
day O
. O

They O
were O
like O
a O
wall O
around O
us O
-- O
they O
protected O
us O
while O
we O
were O
with O
them O
caring O
for O
the O
sheep O
. O

Nabal O
was O
foolish O
to O
say O
what O
he O
did O
. O

Terrible O
trouble O
is O
coming O
to O
our O
master O
and O
all O
his O
family O
. O

You O
need O
to O
think O
of O
something O
to O
do O
. O
'' O

Abigail O
quickly O
gathered O
up O
200 O
loaves O
of O
bread O
, O
two O
full O
wine O
bags O
, O
five O
cooked O
sheep O
, O
about O
a O
bushel O
of O
cooked O
grain O
, O
about O
2 O
quarts O
of O
raisins O
, O
and O
200 O
cakes O
of O
pressed O
figs O
. O

She O
put O
them O
on O
donkeys O
. O

Then O
Abigail O
told O
her O
servants O
, O
`` O
Go O
on O
. O

I O
'll O
follow O
you O
. O
'' O

But O
she O
did O
not O
tell O
her O
husband O
. O

Abigail O
rode O
her O
donkey O
down O
to O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
mountain O
. O

She O
met O
David O
and O
his O
men O
coming O
from O
the O
other O
direction O
. O

David O
was O
saying O
, O
`` O
I O
protected O
Nabal O
's O
property O
in O
the O
desert O
. O

I O
made O
sure O
not O
one O
of O
his O
sheep O
was O
missing O
. O

I O
did O
all O
that O
for O
nothing O
. O

I O
was O
good O
to O
him O
, O
but O
he O
was O
rude O
to O
me O
. O

I O
swear O
, O
I O
wo O
n't O
let O
even O
one O
man O
in O
Nabal O
's O
family O
live O
until O
tomorrow O
morning O
. O
'' O

Just O
then O
Abigail O
arrived O
. O

When O
she O
saw O
David O
, O
she O
quickly O
got O
off O
her O
donkey O
and O
bowed O
down O
with O
her O
face O
to O
the O
ground O
in O
front O
of O
him O
. O

Abigail O
fell O
at O
his O
feet O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Sir O
, O
please O
let O
me O
talk O
to O
you O
. O

Listen O
to O
what O
I O
say O
. O

Blame O
me O
for O
what O
happened O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
see O
the O
men O
you O
sent O
. O

Sir O
, O
do O
n't O
pay O
any O
attention O
to O
that O
worthless O
man O
, O
Nabal O
. O

His O
name O
means O
' O
Foolish O
, O
' O
and O
that O
is O
what O
he O
is O
. O

The O
Lord O
has O
kept O
you O
from O
killing O
innocent O
people O
. O

As O
surely O
as O
the O
Lord O
lives O
and O
you O
as O
well O
, O
may O
your O
enemies O
and O
anyone O
else O
who O
wants O
to O
harm O
you O
be O
as O
cursed O
as O
Nabal O
is O
. O

Now O
, O
I O
am O
bringing O
this O
gift O
to O
you O
. O

Please O
give O
these O
things O
to O
your O
men O
. O

Please O
forgive O
me O
for O
doing O
wrong O
. O

I O
know O
the O
Lord O
will O
make O
your O
family O
strong O
because O
you O
fight O
his O
battles O
. O

People O
will O
never O
find O
anything O
bad O
about O
you O
as O
long O
as O
you O
live O
. O

If O
someone O
chases O
you O
to O
kill O
you O
, O
the O
Lord O
your O
God O
will O
save O
your O
life O
. O

But O
he O
will O
throw O
away O
your O
enemies O
like O
a O
stone O
from O
a O
sling O
. O

The O
Lord O
promised O
to O
do O
many O
good O
things O
for O
you O
, O
and O
he O
will O
keep O
his O
promises O
. O

He O
will O
make O
you O
leader O
over O
Israel O
. O

So O
do O
n't O
do O
anything O
that O
would O
make O
you O
guilty O
of O
killing O
innocent O
people O
. O

Please O
do O
n't O
fall O
into O
that O
trap O
. O

Please O
remember O
me O
when O
the O
Lord O
blesses O
you O
. O
'' O

David O
answered O
Abigail O
, O
`` O
Praise O
the O
Lord O
, O
the O
God O
of O
Israel O
. O

Praise O
God O
for O
sending O
you O
to O
meet O
me O
. O

God O
bless O
you O
for O
your O
good O
judgment O
. O

You O
kept O
me O
from O
killing O
innocent O
people O
today O
. O

As O
surely O
as O
the O
Lord O
, O
the O
God O
of O
Israel O
, O
lives O
, O
if O
you O
had O
n't O
come O
quickly O
to O
meet O
me O
, O
not O
one O
man O
in O
Nabal O
's O
family O
would O
have O
lived O
until O
tomorrow O
morning O
. O

But O
the O
Lord O
prevented O
me O
from O
hurting O
you O
. O
'' O

Then O
David O
accepted O
Abigail O
's O
gifts O
. O

He O
told O
her O
, O
`` O
Go O
home O
in O
peace O
. O

I O
have O
listened O
to O
your O
request O
, O
and O
I O
will O
do O
what O
you O
asked O
. O
'' O

Abigail O
went O
back O
to O
Nabal O
, O
who O
was O
in O
the O
house O
. O

He O
had O
been O
eating O
like O
a O
king O
, O
and O
he O
was O
drunk O
and O
feeling O
good O
. O

So O
Abigail O
told O
Nabal O
nothing O
until O
the O
next O
morning O
. O

The O
next O
morning O
, O
Nabal O
was O
sober O
, O
so O
his O
wife O
told O
him O
everything O
. O

He O
had O
a O
heart O
attack O
and O
became O
as O
stiff O
as O
a O
rock O
. O

About O
ten O
days O
later O
, O
the O
Lord O
gave O
him O
a O
stroke O
and O
Nabal O
died O
. O

When O
David O
heard O
that O
Nabal O
was O
dead O
, O
he O
said O
, O
`` O
Praise O
the O
Lord O
! O

Nabal O
insulted O
me O
, O
but O
the O
Lord O
defended O
my O
honor O
. O

The O
Lord O
kept O
me O
from O
doing O
wrong O
and O
made O
Nabal O
pay O
for O
what O
he O
did O
. O
'' O

Then O
David O
sent O
a O
message O
to O
Abigail O
and O
asked O
her O
to O
be O
his O
wife O
. O

His O
servants O
went O
to O
Carmel O
with O
this O
message O
, O
`` O
David O
sent O
us O
to O
get O
you O
. O

He O
wants O
you O
to O
be O
his O
wife O
. O
'' O

Abigail O
bowed O
her O
face O
to O
the O
ground O
. O

She O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
willing O
to O
be O
your O
slave O
woman O
, O
even O
if O
it O
is O
only O
to O
wash O
the O
feet O
of O
my O
master O
's O
servants O
. O
'' O

Abigail O
quickly O
got O
on O
a O
donkey O
and O
brought O
five O
of O
her O
maids O
with O
her O
. O

They O
followed O
David O
's O
messengers O
. O

So O
Abigail O
became O
David O
's O
wife O
. O

David O
had O
also O
married O
Ahinoam O
of O
Jezreel O
. O

Both O
Ahinoam O
and O
Abigail O
were O
David O
's O
wives O
. O

David O
was O
also O
married O
to O
Saul O
's O
daughter O
Michal O
, O
but O
Saul O
had O
taken O
her O
away O
from O
him O
and O
had O
given O
her O
to O
a O
man O
named O
Palti O
, O
son O
of O
Laish O
. O

Palti O
was O
from O
the O
town O
named O
Gallim O
. O

There O
was O
a O
man O
named O
Elkanah O
from O
the O
Zuph O
family O
who O
lived O
in O
Ramah O
in O
the O
hill O
country O
of O
Ephraim O
. O

Elkanah O
was O
the O
son O
of O
Jeroham O
, O
the O
son O
of O
Elihu O
, O
the O
son O
of O
Tohu O
, O
the O
son O
of O
Zuph O
from O
the O
tribe O
of O
Ephraim O
. O

Elkanah O
had O
two O
wives O
. O

One O
wife O
was O
named O
Hannah O
and O
the O
other O
wife O
was O
named O
Peninnah O
. O

Peninnah O
had O
children O
, O
but O
Hannah O
did O
not O
. O

Every O
year O
Elkanah O
left O
his O
town O
of O
Ramah O
and O
went O
up O
to O
Shiloh O
. O

He O
worshiped O
the O
Lord O
All-Powerful O
at O
Shiloh O
and O
offered O
sacrifices O
to O
the O
Lord O
there O
. O

Shiloh O
was O
where O
Eli O
's O
sons O
, O
Hophni O
and O
Phinehas O
, O
served O
as O
priests O
of O
the O
Lord O
. O

Whenever O
Elkanah O
offered O
his O
sacrifices O
, O
he O
always O
gave O
one O
share O
of O
the O
food O
to O
his O
wife O
Peninnah O
and O
a O
share O
of O
the O
food O
to O
each O
of O
Peninnah O
's O
children O
. O

Elkanah O
always O
gave O
an O
equal O
share O
of O
the O
food O
to O
Hannah O
. O

He O
did O
this O
because O
he O
loved O
her O
very O
much O
, O
even O
though O
the O
Lord O
had O
not O
let O
Hannah O
have O
any O
children O
. O

Peninnah O
always O
upset O
Hannah O
and O
made O
her O
feel O
bad O
because O
the O
Lord O
had O
not O
made O
her O
able O
to O
have O
children O
. O

This O
happened O
every O
year O
when O
their O
family O
went O
to O
the O
Lord O
's O
house O
at O
Shiloh O
. O

Peninnah O
would O
upset O
Hannah O
so O
much O
that O
she O
would O
begin O
to O
cry O
and O
would O
not O
eat O
anything O
. O

One O
year O
when O
this O
happened O
, O
her O
husband O
Elkanah O
said O
to O
her O
, O
`` O
Hannah O
, O
why O
are O
you O
crying O
? O

Why O
wo O
n't O
you O
eat O
? O

Why O
are O
you O
so O
sad O
? O

You O
have O
me O
. O

Is O
n't O
that O
better O
than O
having O
even O
ten O
sons O
? O
'' O

After O
eating O
and O
drinking O
, O
Hannah O
quietly O
got O
up O
and O
went O
to O
pray O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

Eli O
the O
priest O
was O
sitting O
on O
a O
chair O
near O
the O
door O
of O
the O
Lord O
's O
Holy O
Building O
. O

Hannah O
was O
so O
sad O
that O
she O
cried O
the O
whole O
time O
she O
was O
praying O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

She O
made O
a O
special O
promise O
to O
God O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Lord O
All-Powerful O
, O
you O
can O
see O
how O
sad O
I O
am O
. O

Remember O
me O
. O

Do O
n't O
forget O
me O
. O

If O
you O
will O
give O
me O
a O
son O
, O
I O
will O
give O
him O
to O
you O
. O

He O
will O
be O
yours O
his O
whole O
life O
, O
and O
as O
a O
Nazirite O
, O
he O
will O
not O
drink O
wine O
or O
strong O
drink O
, O
and O
no O
one O
will O
ever O
cut O
his O
hair O
. O
'' O

Hannah O
prayed O
to O
the O
Lord O
a O
long O
time O
. O

Eli O
was O
watching O
her O
mouth O
while O
she O
was O
praying O
. O

Hannah O
was O
praying O
in O
her O
heart O
. O

Her O
lips O
were O
moving O
, O
but O
since O
she O
did O
not O
say O
the O
words O
out O
loud O
, O
Eli O
thought O
she O
was O
drunk O
. O

He O
said O
to O
her O
, O
`` O
You O
have O
had O
too O
much O
to O
drink O
. O

It O
is O
time O
to O
put O
away O
the O
wine O
. O
'' O

Hannah O
answered O
, O
`` O
Sir O
, O
I O
have O
not O
drunk O
any O
wine O
or O
beer O
. O

I O
am O
deeply O
troubled O
, O
and O
I O
was O
telling O
the O
Lord O
about O
all O
my O
problems O
. O

Do O
n't O
think O
I O
am O
a O
bad O
woman O
. O

I O
have O
been O
praying O
so O
long O
because O
I O
have O
so O
many O
troubles O
and O
am O
very O
sad O
. O
'' O

Eli O
answered O
, O
`` O
Go O
in O
peace O
. O

May O
the O
God O
of O
Israel O
give O
you O
what O
you O
asked O
for O
. O
'' O

Hannah O
said O
, O
`` O
May O
you O
be O
happy O
with O
me O
. O
'' O

Then O
she O
left O
and O
ate O
something O
. O

She O
was O
not O
sad O
anymore O
. O

Early O
the O
next O
morning O
Elkanah O
's O
family O
got O
up O
. O

They O
worshiped O
the O
Lord O
and O
then O
went O
back O
home O
to O
Ramah O
. O

Elkanah O
had O
sexual O
relations O
with O
his O
wife O
Hannah O
, O
and O
the O
Lord O
remembered O
Hannah O
. O

By O
that O
time O
the O
following O
year O
, O
Hannah O
had O
become O
pregnant O
and O
had O
a O
son O
. O

She O
named O
him O
Samuel O
. O

She O
said O
, O
`` O
His O
name O
is O
Samuel O
because O
I O
asked O
the O
Lord O
for O
him O
. O
'' O

That O
year O
Elkanah O
went O
to O
Shiloh O
to O
offer O
sacrifices O
and O
to O
keep O
the O
promises O
he O
made O
to O
God O
. O

He O
took O
his O
family O
with O
him O
. O

But O
Hannah O
did O
not O
go O
. O

She O
told O
Elkanah O
, O
`` O
When O
the O
boy O
is O
old O
enough O
to O
eat O
solid O
food O
, O
I O
will O
take O
him O
to O
Shiloh O
. O

Then O
I O
will O
give O
him O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

He O
will O
become O
a O
Nazirite O
. O

He O
will O
stay O
there O
at O
Shiloh O
. O
'' O

Hannah O
's O
husband O
Elkanah O
said O
to O
her O
, O
`` O
Do O
what O
you O
think O
is O
best O
. O

You O
may O
stay O
home O
until O
the O
boy O
is O
old O
enough O
to O
eat O
solid O
food O
. O

May O
the O
Lord O
do O
what O
you O
have O
said O
. O
'' O

So O
Hannah O
stayed O
at O
home O
to O
nurse O
her O
son O
until O
he O
was O
old O
enough O
to O
eat O
solid O
food O
. O

When O
the O
boy O
was O
old O
enough O
to O
eat O
solid O
food O
, O
Hannah O
took O
him O
to O
the O
Lord O
's O
house O
at O
Shiloh O
. O

She O
also O
took O
a O
bull O
that O
was O
three O
years O
old O
, O
20 O
pounds O
of O
flour O
, O
and O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine O
. O

They O
went O
before O
the O
Lord O
. O

Elkanah O
killed O
the O
bull O
as O
a O
sacrifice O
to O
the O
Lord O
as O
he O
usually O
did O
. O

Then O
Hannah O
gave O
the O
boy O
to O
Eli O
. O

She O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Pardon O
me O
, O
sir O
. O

I O
am O
the O
same O
woman O
who O
stood O
near O
you O
praying O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

I O
promise O
that O
I O
am O
telling O
the O
truth O
. O

I O
prayed O
for O
this O
child O
, O
and O
the O
Lord O
answered O
my O
prayer O
. O

He O
gave O
me O
this O
child O
. O

And O
now O
I O
give O
this O
child O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

He O
will O
serve O
the O
Lord O
all O
his O
life O
. O
'' O

Then O
Hannah O
left O
the O
boy O
there O
and O
worshiped O
the O
Lord O
. O

The O
Philistines O
carried O
God O
's O
Holy O
Box O
, O
from O
Ebenezer O
to O
Ashdod O
. O

They O
carried O
God O
's O
Holy O
Box O
into O
the O
temple O
of O
Dagon O
and O
put O
it O
next O
to O
the O
statue O
of O
Dagon O
. O

The O
next O
morning O
, O
the O
people O
of O
Ashdod O
got O
up O
and O
found O
Dagon O
lying O
face O
down O
on O
the O
ground O
before O
the O
Lord O
's O
Box O
. O

The O
people O
of O
Ashdod O
put O
the O
statue O
of O
Dagon O
back O
in O
its O
place O
. O

But O
the O
next O
morning O
when O
the O
people O
of O
Ashdod O
got O
up O
, O
they O
found O
Dagon O
on O
the O
ground O
again O
. O

Dagon O
had O
fallen O
down O
before O
the O
Lord O
's O
Holy O
Box O
. O

This O
time O
, O
Dagon O
's O
head O
and O
hands O
were O
broken O
off O
and O
were O
lying O
in O
the O
doorway O
. O

Only O
his O
body O
was O
still O
in O
one O
piece O
. O

That O
is O
why O
, O
even O
today O
, O
the O
priests O
or O
other O
people O
refuse O
to O
step O
on O
the O
threshold O
when O
they O
enter O
Dagon O
's O
temple O
at O
Ashdod O
. O

The O
Lord O
made O
life O
hard O
for O
the O
people O
of O
Ashdod O
and O
their O
neighbors O
. O

He O
gave O
them O
many O
troubles O
and O
caused O
them O
to O
get O
tumors O
. O

He O
also O
sent O
mice O
to O
them O
. O

The O
mice O
ran O
all O
over O
their O
ships O
and O
then O
onto O
their O
land O
. O

The O
people O
in O
the O
city O
were O
very O
afraid O
. O

They O
saw O
what O
was O
happening O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
Holy O
Box O
of O
the O
God O
of O
Israel O
ca O
n't O
stay O
here O
. O

God O
is O
punishing O
us O
and O
Dagon O
our O
god O
. O
'' O

The O
people O
of O
Ashdod O
called O
the O
five O
Philistine O
rulers O
together O
and O
asked O
them O
, O
`` O
What O
must O
we O
do O
with O
the O
Holy O
Box O
of O
the O
God O
of O
Israel O
? O
'' O

The O
rulers O
answered O
, O
`` O
Move O
the O
Holy O
Box O
of O
the O
God O
of O
Israel O
to O
Gath O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
Philistines O
moved O
God O
's O
Holy O
Box O
. O

But O
after O
the O
Philistines O
had O
moved O
God O
's O
Holy O
Box O
to O
Gath O
, O
the O
Lord O
punished O
that O
city O
. O

The O
people O
became O
very O
frightened O
. O

God O
caused O
many O
troubles O
for O
all O
the O
people O
-- O
young O
and O
old O
. O

He O
caused O
the O
people O
in O
Gath O
to O
have O
tumors O
. O

So O
the O
Philistines O
sent O
God O
's O
Holy O
Box O
to O
Ekron O
. O

But O
when O
God O
's O
Holy O
Box O
came O
into O
Ekron O
, O
the O
people O
of O
Ekron O
complained O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Why O
are O
you O
bringing O
the O
Box O
of O
the O
God O
of O
Israel O
to O
our O
city O
Ekron O
? O

Do O
you O
want O
to O
kill O
us O
and O
our O
people O
? O
'' O

The O
people O
of O
Ekron O
called O
all O
the O
Philistine O
rulers O
together O
and O
said O
to O
the O
rulers O
, O
`` O
Send O
the O
Box O
of O
the O
God O
of O
Israel O
back O
home O
before O
it O
kills O
us O
and O
our O
people O
! O
'' O

The O
people O
of O
Ekron O
were O
deathly O
afraid O
because O
God O
severely O
punished O
them O
there O
. O

Many O
people O
died O
, O
and O
those O
who O
did O
not O
, O
had O
tumors O
. O

The O
people O
of O
Ekron O
cried O
loudly O
to O
heaven O
. O

The O
men O
of O
Kiriath O
Jearim O
came O
and O
took O
the O
Lord O
's O
Holy O
Box O
up O
the O
hill O
to O
the O
house O
of O
Abinadab O
the O
priest O
. O

They O
performed O
a O
special O
ceremony O
to O
prepare O
Abinadab O
's O
son O
, O
Eleazar O
, O
to O
guard O
the O
Lord O
's O
Holy O
Box O
. O

The O
Box O
stayed O
there O
at O
Kiriath O
Jearim O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

Twenty O
years O
passed O
while O
the O
Holy O
Box O
was O
in O
Kiriath O
Jearim O
, O
and O
the O
Israelites O
began O
to O
follow O
the O
Lord O
again O
. O

Samuel O
told O
the O
Israelites O
, O
`` O
If O
you O
are O
really O
coming O
back O
to O
the O
Lord O
with O
all O
your O
heart O
, O
you O
must O
throw O
away O
your O
foreign O
gods O
and O
your O
idols O
of O
Ashtoreth O
. O

You O
must O
give O
yourselves O
fully O
to O
the O
Lord O
and O
serve O
only O
him O
. O

Then O
he O
will O
save O
you O
from O
the O
Philistines O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
Israelites O
threw O
away O
their O
statues O
of O
Baal O
and O
Ashtoreth O
. O

The O
Israelites O
served O
only O
the O
Lord O
. O

Samuel O
said O
, O
`` O
All O
Israel O
must O
meet O
at O
Mizpah O
. O

I O
will O
pray O
to O
the O
Lord O
for O
you O
. O
'' O

The O
Israelites O
met O
together O
at O
Mizpah O
. O

They O
got O
water O
and O
poured O
it O
out O
before O
the O
Lord O
. O

In O
this O
way O
they O
began O
a O
time O
of O
fasting O
. O

They O
did O
not O
eat O
any O
food O
that O
day O
, O
and O
they O
confessed O
their O
sins O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
We O
have O
sinned O
against O
the O
Lord O
. O
'' O

So O
Samuel O
served O
as O
a O
judge O
of O
Israel O
at O
Mizpah O
. O

When O
the O
Philistines O
heard O
that O
the O
Israelites O
were O
meeting O
at O
Mizpah O
, O
they O
went O
to O
fight O
them O
. O

The O
Israelites O
were O
frightened O
when O
they O
heard O
the O
Philistines O
were O
coming O
and O
said O
to O
Samuel O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
stop O
praying O
to O
the O
Lord O
our O
God O
for O
us O
. O

Ask O
the O
Lord O
to O
save O
us O
from O
the O
Philistines O
. O
'' O

Samuel O
took O
a O
baby O
lamb O
and O
offered O
it O
as O
a O
whole O
burnt O
offering O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

He O
prayed O
to O
the O
Lord O
for O
Israel O
, O
and O
the O
Lord O
answered O
his O
prayer O
. O

The O
Philistines O
came O
closer O
and O
closer O
to O
fight O
the O
Israelites O
while O
Samuel O
offered O
the O
sacrifice O
. O

But O
then O
, O
the O
Lord O
caused O
a O
loud O
clap O
of O
thunder O
to O
hit O
near O
the O
Philistines O
. O

The O
thunder O
scared O
the O
Philistines O
, O
and O
they O
became O
confused O
, O
so O
the O
Israelites O
defeated O
them O
in O
battle O
. O

The O
men O
of O
Israel O
ran O
out O
of O
Mizpah O
and O
chased O
the O
Philistines O
all O
the O
way O
to O
Beth O
Car O
. O

They O
killed O
Philistine O
soldiers O
all O
along O
the O
way O
. O

After O
this O
Samuel O
set O
up O
a O
special O
stone O
to O
help O
people O
remember O
what O
God O
did O
. O

Samuel O
put O
the O
stone O
between O
Mizpah O
and O
Shen O
and O
named O
the O
stone O
`` O
Stone O
of O
Help O
. O
'' O

Samuel O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
Lord O
helped O
us O
all O
the O
way O
to O
this O
place O
. O
'' O

The O
Philistines O
were O
defeated O
and O
did O
not O
enter O
the O
land O
of O
Israel O
again O
. O

The O
Lord O
was O
against O
the O
Philistines O
during O
the O
rest O
of O
Samuel O
's O
life O
. O

The O
Philistines O
had O
taken O
some O
cities O
from O
Israel O
, O
but O
the O
Israelites O
won O
them O
back O
. O

They O
recovered O
those O
cities O
throughout O
the O
Philistine O
area O
, O
from O
Ekron O
to O
Gath O
. O

There O
was O
also O
peace O
between O
Israel O
and O
the O
Amorites O
. O

Samuel O
led O
Israel O
all O
his O
life O
. O

He O
went O
from O
place O
to O
place O
judging O
the O
Israelites O
. O

Every O
year O
he O
traveled O
around O
the O
country O
. O

He O
went O
to O
Bethel O
, O
Gilgal O
, O
and O
Mizpah O
and O
he O
judged O
the O
Israelites O
in O
all O
these O
places O
. O

But O
Samuel O
always O
went O
back O
to O
his O
home O
in O
Ramah O
. O

There O
he O
built O
an O
altar O
to O
the O
Lord O
and O
judged O
Israel O
. O

Later O
, O
the O
Philistines O
gathered O
their O
armies O
to O
fight O
against O
Israel O
. O

Achish O
said O
to O
David O
, O
`` O
Do O
you O
understand O
that O
you O
and O
your O
men O
must O
go O
with O
me O
to O
fight O
against O
Israel O
? O
'' O

David O
answered O
, O
`` O
Certainly O
, O
then O
you O
can O
see O
for O
yourself O
what O
I O
can O
do O
. O
'' O

Achish O
said O
, O
`` O
Fine O
, O
I O
will O
make O
you O
my O
permanent O
bodyguard O
. O
'' O

After O
Samuel O
died O
, O
all O
the O
Israelites O
mourned O
for O
him O
and O
buried O
him O
in O
Ramah O
, O
his O
hometown O
. O

Saul O
had O
removed O
the O
mediums O
and O
fortunetellers O
from O
Israel O
. O

The O
Philistines O
prepared O
for O
war O
. O

They O
came O
to O
Shunem O
and O
made O
their O
camp O
at O
that O
place O
. O

Saul O
gathered O
all O
the O
Israelites O
together O
and O
made O
his O
camp O
at O
Gilboa O
. O

Saul O
saw O
the O
Philistine O
army O
, O
and O
he O
was O
afraid O
. O

His O
heart O
pounded O
with O
fear O
. O

He O
prayed O
to O
the O
Lord O
, O
but O
the O
Lord O
did O
not O
answer O
him O
. O

God O
did O
not O
talk O
to O
Saul O
in O
dreams O
. O

God O
did O
not O
use O
the O
Urim O
to O
give O
him O
an O
answer O
, O
and O
God O
did O
not O
use O
prophets O
to O
speak O
to O
Saul O
. O

Finally O
, O
Saul O
said O
to O
his O
officers O
, O
`` O
Find O
me O
a O
woman O
who O
is O
a O
medium O
. O

Then O
I O
can O
go O
ask O
her O
what O
will O
happen O
. O
'' O

His O
officers O
answered O
, O
`` O
There O
is O
a O
medium O
at O
Endor O
. O
'' O

That O
night O
, O
Saul O
put O
on O
different O
clothes O
so O
that O
no O
one O
would O
know O
who O
he O
was O
. O

Then O
Saul O
and O
two O
of O
his O
men O
went O
to O
see O
the O
woman O
. O

Saul O
said O
to O
her O
, O
`` O
I O
want O
you O
to O
bring O
up O
a O
ghost O
who O
can O
tell O
me O
what O
will O
happen O
in O
the O
future O
. O

You O
must O
call O
for O
the O
ghost O
of O
the O
person O
I O
name O
. O
'' O

But O
the O
woman O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
You O
know O
that O
Saul O
forced O
all O
the O
mediums O
and O
fortunetellers O
to O
leave O
the O
land O
of O
Israel O
. O

You O
are O
trying O
to O
trap O
me O
and O
kill O
me O
. O
'' O

Saul O
used O
the O
Lord O
's O
name O
to O
make O
a O
promise O
to O
the O
woman O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
As O
surely O
as O
the O
Lord O
lives O
, O
you O
wo O
n't O
be O
punished O
for O
doing O
this O
. O
'' O

The O
woman O
asked O
, O
`` O
Who O
do O
you O
want O
me O
to O
bring O
up O
for O
you O
? O
'' O

Saul O
answered O
, O
`` O
Bring O
up O
Samuel O
. O
'' O

And O
it O
happened O
-- O
the O
woman O
saw O
Samuel O
and O
screamed O
. O

She O
said O
to O
Saul O
, O
`` O
You O
tricked O
me O
! O

You O
are O
Saul O
. O
'' O

The O
king O
said O
to O
the O
woman O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
be O
afraid O
! O

What O
do O
you O
see O
? O
'' O

The O
woman O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
see O
a O
spirit O
coming O
up O
out O
of O
the O
ground O
. O
'' O

Saul O
asked O
, O
`` O
What O
does O
he O
look O
like O
? O
'' O

The O
woman O
answered O
, O
`` O
He O
looks O
like O
an O
old O
man O
wearing O
a O
special O
robe O
. O
'' O

Then O
Saul O
knew O
it O
was O
Samuel O
, O
and O
he O
bowed O
down O
. O

His O
face O
touched O
the O
ground O
. O

Samuel O
said O
to O
Saul O
, O
`` O
Why O
did O
you O
bother O
me O
? O

Why O
did O
you O
bring O
me O
up O
? O
'' O

Saul O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
in O
trouble O
! O

The O
Philistines O
have O
come O
to O
fight O
me O
, O
and O
God O
has O
left O
me O
. O

God O
wo O
n't O
answer O
me O
anymore O
. O

He O
wo O
n't O
use O
prophets O
or O
dreams O
to O
answer O
me O
, O
so O
I O
called O
you O
. O

I O
want O
you O
to O
tell O
me O
what O
to O
do O
. O
'' O

Samuel O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
Lord O
left O
you O
and O
is O
now O
your O
enemy O
, O
so O
why O
are O
you O
asking O
me O
for O
advice O
? O

The O
Lord O
used O
me O
to O
tell O
you O
what O
he O
would O
do O
, O
and O
now O
he O
is O
doing O
what O
he O
said O
he O
would O
do O
. O

He O
is O
tearing O
the O
kingdom O
out O
of O
your O
hands O
and O
giving O
it O
to O
your O
neighbor O
, O
David O
. O

The O
reason O
this O
is O
happening O
is O
because O
you O
did O
not O
obey O
the O
Lord O
and O
destroy O
the O
Amalekites O
. O

The O
Lord O
will O
let O
the O
Philistines O
defeat O
you O
and O
the O
army O
of O
Israel O
today O
. O

Tomorrow O
, O
you O
and O
your O
sons O
will O
be O
here O
with O
me O
. O
'' O

Saul O
quickly O
fell O
to O
the O
ground O
and O
lay O
stretched O
out O
there O
. O

Saul O
was O
afraid O
because O
of O
what O
Samuel O
said O
. O

Saul O
was O
also O
very O
weak O
because O
he O
had O
not O
eaten O
any O
food O
all O
that O
day O
and O
night O
. O

The O
woman O
came O
over O
to O
Saul O
and O
saw O
how O
afraid O
he O
was O
. O

She O
said O
, O
`` O
Look O
, O
I O
am O
your O
servant O
. O

I O
have O
obeyed O
you O
. O

I O
risked O
my O
life O
and O
did O
what O
you O
told O
me O
to O
do O
. O

Please O
, O
listen O
to O
me O
. O

You O
need O
to O
eat O
. O

Let O
me O
get O
you O
some O
food O
. O

Then O
you O
will O
have O
enough O
strength O
to O
go O
on O
your O
way O
. O
'' O

But O
Saul O
refused O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
wo O
n't O
eat O
. O
'' O

Saul O
's O
officers O
joined O
the O
woman O
and O
begged O
him O
to O
eat O
. O

Finally O
, O
Saul O
listened O
to O
them O
. O

He O
got O
up O
from O
the O
ground O
and O
sat O
on O
the O
bed O
. O

The O
woman O
had O
a O
calf O
that O
she O
had O
been O
fattening O
. O

She O
quickly O
killed O
the O
calf O
. O

She O
took O
some O
flour O
and O
pressed O
it O
with O
her O
hands O
. O

Then O
she O
baked O
some O
bread O
without O
yeast O
. O

The O
woman O
put O
the O
food O
before O
Saul O
and O
his O
officers O
and O
they O
ate O
. O

Then O
they O
got O
up O
and O
left O
during O
the O
night O
. O

Saul O
was O
30 O
years O
old O
when O
he O
became O
king O
. O

He O
ruled O
over O
Israel O
42 O
years O
. O

Saul O
chose O
3000 O
men O
from O
Israel O
. O

There O
were O
2000 O
men O
who O
stayed O
with O
him O
at O
Micmash O
in O
the O
hill O
country O
of O
Bethel O
. O

There O
were O
1000 O
men O
who O
stayed O
with O
Jonathan O
at O
Gibeah O
in O
Benjamin O
. O

Saul O
sent O
the O
other O
men O
in O
the O
army O
back O
home O
. O

Jonathan O
defeated O
the O
Philistines O
at O
their O
camp O
in O
Geba O
. O

The O
Philistines O
heard O
about O
this O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
Hebrews O
have O
rebelled O
. O
'' O

Saul O
said O
, O
`` O
Let O
the O
Hebrew O
people O
hear O
what O
happened O
. O
'' O

So O
Saul O
told O
the O
men O
to O
blow O
trumpets O
through O
all O
the O
land O
of O
Israel O
. O

All O
the O
Israelites O
heard O
this O
news O
: O
`` O
Saul O
has O
killed O
the O
Philistine O
leader O
. O

Now O
the O
Philistines O
will O
really O
hate O
the O
Israelites O
! O
'' O

The O
Israelites O
were O
called O
to O
join O
Saul O
at O
Gilgal O
. O

The O
Philistines O
gathered O
to O
fight O
Israel O
. O

The O
Philistines O
camped O
at O
Micmash O
, O
east O
of O
Beth O
Aven O
. O

They O
had O
3000 O
chariots O
and O
6000 O
horse O
soldiers O
. O

There O
were O
so O
many O
Philistines O
that O
they O
were O
like O
sand O
on O
the O
seashore O
. O

The O
Israelites O
saw O
that O
they O
were O
in O
trouble O
. O

They O
felt O
trapped O
. O

They O
ran O
away O
to O
hide O
in O
caves O
and O
cracks O
in O
the O
rock O
. O

They O
hid O
among O
the O
rocks O
, O
in O
wells O
, O
and O
in O
other O
holes O
in O
the O
ground O
. O

Some O
Hebrews O
even O
went O
across O
the O
Jordan O
River O
to O
the O
land O
of O
Gad O
and O
Gilead O
. O

Saul O
was O
still O
at O
Gilgal O
. O

All O
the O
men O
in O
his O
army O
were O
shaking O
with O
fear O
. O

Samuel O
said O
he O
would O
meet O
Saul O
at O
Gilgal O
. O

Saul O
waited O
there O
seven O
days O
. O

But O
Samuel O
had O
not O
yet O
come O
to O
Gilgal O
, O
and O
the O
soldiers O
began O
to O
leave O
Saul O
. O

So O
Saul O
said O
, O
`` O
Bring O
me O
the O
burnt O
offerings O
and O
the O
fellowship O
offerings O
. O
'' O

Then O
Saul O
offered O
the O
burnt O
offering O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
Saul O
finished O
offering O
that O
sacrifice O
, O
Samuel O
arrived O
. O

Saul O
went O
out O
to O
meet O
him O
. O

Samuel O
asked O
, O
`` O
What O
have O
you O
done O
? O
'' O

Saul O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
saw O
the O
soldiers O
leaving O
me O
. O

You O
were O
not O
here O
on O
time O
, O
and O
the O
Philistines O
were O
gathering O
at O
Micmash O
. O

I O
thought O
to O
myself O
, O
' O
The O
Philistines O
will O
come O
here O
and O
attack O
me O
at O
Gilgal O
, O
and O
I O
have O
n't O
asked O
the O
Lord O
to O
help O
us O
yet O
. O

So O
I O
forced O
myself O
to O
offer O
the O
burnt O
offering O
. O
' O
'' O

Samuel O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
did O
a O
foolish O
thing O
. O

You O
did O
not O
obey O
the O
Lord O
your O
God O
. O

If O
you O
had O
obeyed O
God O
's O
command O
, O
he O
would O
have O
let O
your O
family O
rule O
Israel O
forever O
. O

But O
now O
your O
kingdom O
wo O
n't O
continue O
. O

The O
Lord O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
man O
who O
wants O
to O
obey O
him O
. O

He O
has O
found O
that O
man O
-- O
and O
the O
Lord O
has O
chosen O
him O
to O
be O
the O
new O
leader O
of O
his O
people O
, O
because O
you O
did O
n't O
obey O
his O
command O
. O
'' O

Then O
Samuel O
got O
up O
and O
left O
Gilgal O
. O

Saul O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
his O
army O
left O
Gilgal O
and O
went O
to O
Gibeah O
in O
Benjamin O
. O

Saul O
counted O
the O
men O
who O
were O
still O
with O
him O
. O

There O
were O
about O
600 O
. O

Saul O
, O
his O
son O
Jonathan O
, O
and O
the O
soldiers O
went O
to O
Geba O
in O
Benjamin O
. O

The O
Philistines O
were O
camped O
at O
Micmash O
. O

So O
their O
best O
soldiers O
began O
the O
attack O
. O

The O
Philistine O
army O
split O
into O
three O
groups O
. O

One O
group O
went O
north O
on O
the O
road O
to O
Ophrah O
, O
near O
Shual O
. O

The O
second O
group O
went O
southeast O
on O
the O
road O
to O
Beth O
Horon O
, O
and O
the O
third O
group O
went O
east O
on O
the O
road O
to O
the O
border O
. O

That O
road O
looks O
over O
the O
Valley O
of O
Zeboim O
toward O
the O
desert O
. O

There O
were O
no O
blacksmiths O
in O
Israel O
. O

The O
Philistines O
would O
not O
allow O
them O
because O
they O
were O
afraid O
the O
Israelites O
would O
make O
iron O
swords O
and O
spears O
. O

Only O
the O
Philistines O
could O
sharpen O
iron O
tools O
. O

So O
if O
the O
Israelites O
needed O
to O
sharpen O
their O
plows O
, O
hoes O
, O
axes O
, O
or O
sickles O
, O
they O
had O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Philistines O
. O

The O
Philistine O
blacksmiths O
charged O
1/3 O
ounce O
of O
silver O
for O
sharpening O
plows O
and O
hoes O
and O
1/6 O
ounce O
of O
silver O
for O
sharpening O
picks O
, O
axes O
, O
and O
the O
iron O
tip O
on O
ox O
goads O
. O

So O
on O
the O
day O
of O
battle O
, O
none O
of O
the O
Israelite O
soldiers O
with O
Saul O
had O
iron O
swords O
or O
spears O
. O

Only O
Saul O
and O
his O
son O
Jonathan O
had O
such O
weapons O
. O

A O
group O
of O
Philistine O
soldiers O
guarded O
the O
mountain O
pass O
at O
Micmash O
. O

About O
a O
month O
later O
, O
Nahash O
the O
Ammonite O
and O
his O
army O
surrounded O
Jabesh O
Gilead O
. O

All O
the O
people O
of O
Jabesh O
said O
to O
Nahash O
, O
`` O
If O
you O
will O
make O
a O
treaty O
with O
us O
, O
we O
will O
serve O
you O
. O
'' O

But O
he O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
will O
make O
a O
treaty O
with O
you O
people O
only O
if O
I O
can O
poke O
out O
the O
right O
eye O
of O
each O
person O
. O

Then O
all O
Israel O
will O
be O
ashamed O
. O
'' O

The O
leaders O
of O
Jabesh O
said O
to O
Nahash O
, O
`` O
Let O
us O
have O
seven O
days O
. O

We O
will O
send O
messengers O
through O
all O
Israel O
. O

If O
no O
one O
comes O
to O
help O
us O
, O
we O
will O
come O
up O
to O
you O
and O
surrender O
to O
you O
. O
'' O

The O
messengers O
came O
to O
Gibeah O
where O
Saul O
lived O
. O

They O
told O
the O
news O
to O
the O
people O
. O

The O
people O
cried O
loudly O
. O

Saul O
had O
been O
out O
in O
the O
field O
with O
his O
oxen O
. O

When O
he O
came O
in O
from O
the O
field O
he O
heard O
the O
people O
crying O
and O
asked O
, O
`` O
What O
's O
wrong O
with O
the O
people O
? O

Why O
are O
they O
crying O
? O
'' O

Then O
the O
people O
told O
Saul O
what O
the O
messengers O
from O
Jabesh O
said O
. O

Saul O
listened O
to O
their O
story O
. O

Then O
God O
's O
Spirit O
came O
on O
him O
with O
great O
power O
. O

Saul O
became O
very O
angry O
. O

He O
took O
a O
pair O
of O
oxen O
and O
cut O
them O
in O
pieces O
. O

Then O
he O
gave O
the O
pieces O
of O
the O
oxen O
to O
messengers O
. O

He O
ordered O
the O
messengers O
to O
carry O
the O
pieces O
throughout O
the O
land O
of O
Israel O
. O

He O
told O
them O
to O
give O
this O
message O
to O
the O
Israelites O
: O
`` O
Come O
follow O
Saul O
and O
Samuel O
. O

If O
anyone O
does O
n't O
come O
and O
help O
them O
, O
this O
same O
thing O
will O
happen O
to O
his O
oxen O
. O
'' O

A O
great O
fear O
from O
the O
Lord O
came O
on O
the O
people O
. O

They O
all O
came O
together O
like O
one O
person O
. O

Saul O
gathered O
the O
men O
together O
at O
Bezek O
. O

There O
were O
300,000 O
men O
from O
Israel O
and O
30,000 O
men O
from O
Judah O
. O

Saul O
and O
his O
army O
told O
the O
messengers O
from O
Jabesh O
, O
`` O
Tell O
the O
people O
at O
Jabesh O
in O
Gilead O
that O
by O
noon O
tomorrow O
, O
you O
will O
be O
saved O
. O
'' O

The O
messengers O
told O
Saul O
's O
message O
to O
the O
people O
at O
Jabesh O
, O
and O
they O
were O
very O
happy O
. O

Then O
the O
people O
of O
Jabesh O
said O
to O
Nahash O
the O
Ammonite O
, O
`` O
Tomorrow O
we O
will O
come O
to O
you O
, O
and O
you O
can O
do O
whatever O
you O
want O
to O
us O
. O
'' O

The O
next O
morning O
Saul O
separated O
his O
soldiers O
into O
three O
groups O
. O

At O
sunrise O
, O
Saul O
and O
his O
soldiers O
entered O
the O
Ammonite O
camp O
. O

Saul O
attacked O
while O
they O
were O
changing O
guards O
that O
morning O
. O

He O
and O
his O
soldiers O
defeated O
the O
Ammonites O
before O
noon O
. O

The O
Ammonite O
soldiers O
all O
ran O
away O
in O
different O
directions O
-- O
no O
two O
soldiers O
stayed O
together O
. O

Then O
the O
people O
said O
to O
Samuel O
, O
`` O
Where O
are O
the O
people O
who O
said O
they O
did O
n't O
want O
Saul O
to O
rule O
as O
king O
? O

Bring O
them O
here O
, O
and O
we O
will O
kill O
them O
. O
'' O

But O
Saul O
said O
, O
`` O
No O
, O
do O
n't O
kill O
anyone O
today O
! O

The O
Lord O
saved O
Israel O
today O
. O
'' O

Then O
Samuel O
said O
to O
the O
people O
, O
`` O
Come O
, O
let O
's O
go O
to O
Gilgal O
. O

At O
Gilgal O
we O
will O
again O
make O
Saul O
the O
king O
. O
'' O

All O
the O
people O
went O
to O
Gilgal O
. O

There O
, O
in O
front O
of O
the O
Lord O
, O
the O
people O
made O
Saul O
king O
. O

They O
offered O
fellowship O
offerings O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

Saul O
and O
all O
the O
Israelites O
had O
a O
great O
celebration O
. O

People O
told O
David O
, O
`` O
Look O
, O
the O
Philistines O
are O
fighting O
against O
the O
city O
of O
Keilah O
. O

They O
are O
robbing O
grain O
from O
the O
threshing O
floors O
. O
'' O

David O
asked O
the O
Lord O
, O
`` O
Should O
I O
go O
and O
fight O
these O
Philistines O
? O
'' O

The O
Lord O
answered O
David O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
go O
attack O
the O
Philistines O
. O

Save O
Keilah O
. O
'' O

But O
David O
's O
men O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Look O
, O
our O
men O
are O
afraid O
here O
in O
Judah O
. O

Just O
think O
how O
afraid O
we O
will O
be O
if O
we O
go O
to O
Keilah O
, O
where O
the O
Philistine O
army O
is O
lined O
up O
and O
ready O
for O
battle O
. O
'' O

David O
again O
asked O
the O
Lord O
. O

And O
the O
Lord O
answered O
David O
, O
`` O
Go O
down O
to O
Keilah O
. O

I O
will O
help O
you O
defeat O
the O
Philistines O
. O
'' O

So O
David O
and O
his O
men O
went O
to O
Keilah O
. O

David O
's O
men O
fought O
the O
Philistines O
. O

They O
defeated O
them O
and O
took O
their O
cattle O
. O

In O
this O
way O
David O
saved O
the O
people O
of O
Keilah O
. O

-LRB- O
When O
Abiathar O
ran O
away O
to O
David O
, O
Abiathar O
took O
an O
ephod O
with O
him O
. O
-RRB- O

People O
told O
Saul O
that O
David O
was O
now O
at O
Keilah O
. O

Saul O
said O
, O
`` O
God O
has O
given O
David O
to O
me O
. O

David O
trapped O
himself O
when O
he O
went O
into O
a O
city O
surrounded O
by O
a O
wall O
with O
gates O
and O
bars O
to O
lock O
them O
. O
'' O

Saul O
called O
all O
his O
army O
together O
for O
battle O
. O

They O
prepared O
to O
go O
down O
to O
Keilah O
to O
attack O
David O
and O
his O
men O
. O

David O
learned O
that O
Saul O
was O
making O
plans O
against O
him O
. O

David O
then O
said O
to O
Abiathar O
the O
priest O
, O
`` O
Bring O
the O
ephod O
. O
'' O

David O
prayed O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
God O
of O
Israel O
, O
I O
have O
heard O
that O
Saul O
plans O
to O
come O
to O
Keilah O
and O
destroy O
the O
town O
because O
of O
me O
. O

Will O
Saul O
come O
to O
Keilah O
? O

Will O
the O
people O
of O
Keilah O
give O
me O
to O
Saul O
? O

Lord O
, O
God O
of O
Israel O
, O
I O
am O
your O
servant O
. O

Please O
tell O
me O
! O
'' O

The O
Lord O
answered O
, O
`` O
Saul O
will O
come O
. O
'' O

Again O
David O
asked O
, O
`` O
Will O
the O
people O
of O
Keilah O
give O
me O
and O
my O
men O
to O
Saul O
? O
'' O

The O
Lord O
answered O
, O
`` O
They O
will O
. O
'' O

So O
David O
and O
his O
men O
left O
Keilah O
. O

There O
were O
about O
600 O
men O
who O
went O
with O
David O
. O

They O
kept O
moving O
from O
place O
to O
place O
. O

Saul O
learned O
that O
David O
had O
escaped O
from O
Keilah O
, O
so O
he O
did O
not O
go O
to O
that O
city O
. O

David O
went O
into O
the O
Desert O
of O
Ziph O
and O
stayed O
in O
the O
mountains O
and O
fortresses O
there O
. O

Saul O
looked O
for O
David O
the O
whole O
time O
, O
but O
the O
Lord O
did O
n't O
let O
Saul O
catch O
him O
. O

David O
was O
at O
Horesh O
in O
the O
Desert O
of O
Ziph O
. O

He O
was O
afraid O
because O
Saul O
was O
coming O
to O
kill O
him O
. O

But O
Saul O
's O
son O
Jonathan O
went O
to O
see O
David O
at O
Horesh O
and O
encouraged O
him O
to O
have O
a O
stronger O
faith O
in O
God O
. O

Jonathan O
told O
David O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
be O
afraid O
. O

My O
father O
Saul O
wo O
n't O
hurt O
you O
. O

You O
will O
become O
the O
king O
of O
Israel O
, O
and O
I O
will O
be O
second O
to O
you O
. O

Even O
my O
father O
knows O
this O
. O
'' O

Jonathan O
and O
David O
both O
made O
an O
agreement O
before O
the O
Lord O
. O

Then O
Jonathan O
went O
home O
, O
and O
David O
stayed O
at O
Horesh O
. O

Some O
people O
from O
Ziph O
went O
to O
Saul O
at O
Gibeah O
and O
told O
him O
, O
`` O
David O
is O
hiding O
in O
our O
area O
. O

He O
is O
at O
the O
fortresses O
of O
Horesh O
on O
Hakilah O
Hill O
, O
south O
of O
Jeshimon O
. O

Now O
, O
King O
, O
come O
down O
any O
time O
you O
want O
. O

It O
is O
our O
duty O
to O
give O
David O
to O
you O
. O
'' O

Saul O
answered O
, O
`` O
May O
the O
Lord O
bless O
you O
for O
helping O
me O
. O

Go O
and O
learn O
more O
about O
David O
. O

Keep O
track O
of O
where O
he O
goes O
and O
who O
goes O
to O
see O
him O
. O

I O
am O
told O
that O
David O
is O
smart O
and O
that O
he O
is O
trying O
to O
trick O
me O
. O

Find O
all O
the O
hiding O
places O
that O
David O
uses O
. O

Then O
come O
back O
to O
me O
and O
tell O
me O
everything O
. O

Then O
I O
'll O
go O
with O
you O
. O

If O
David O
is O
in O
the O
area O
, O
I O
will O
find O
him O
, O
even O
if O
I O
must O
go O
to O
every O
family O
group O
in O
Judah O
. O
'' O

So O
those O
people O
went O
back O
to O
Ziph O
before O
Saul O
. O

David O
and O
his O
men O
were O
in O
the O
Desert O
of O
Maon O
, O
south O
of O
Jeshimon O
. O

Saul O
and O
his O
men O
went O
to O
look O
for O
David O
, O
but O
the O
people O
warned O
him O
. O

They O
told O
David O
that O
Saul O
was O
looking O
for O
him O
. O

So O
David O
then O
went O
down O
to O
`` O
The O
Rock O
'' O
in O
the O
Desert O
of O
Maon O
. O

Saul O
heard O
that O
David O
had O
gone O
to O
the O
Desert O
of O
Maon O
, O
so O
Saul O
went O
to O
that O
place O
to O
find O
him O
. O

Saul O
was O
on O
one O
side O
of O
the O
mountain O
. O

David O
and O
his O
men O
were O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
same O
mountain O
. O

David O
was O
moving O
as O
quickly O
as O
possible O
to O
get O
away O
from O
Saul O
. O

But O
Saul O
and O
his O
soldiers O
were O
going O
around O
the O
mountain O
to O
cut O
them O
off O
and O
trap O
David O
and O
his O
men O
. O

Then O
a O
messenger O
arrived O
and O
told O
Saul O
, O
`` O
Come O
quickly O
! O

The O
Philistines O
are O
attacking O
. O
'' O

So O
Saul O
stopped O
chasing O
David O
and O
went O
to O
fight O
the O
Philistines O
. O

That O
is O
why O
people O
call O
this O
place O
`` O
Slippery O
Rock O
. O
'' O

David O
left O
the O
Desert O
of O
Maon O
and O
went O
to O
the O
fortresses O
near O
En O
Gedi O
. O

After O
Saul O
had O
chased O
the O
Philistines O
away O
, O
people O
told O
him O
, O
`` O
David O
is O
in O
the O
desert O
area O
near O
En O
Gedi O
. O
'' O

So O
Saul O
chose O
3000 O
men O
from O
all O
over O
Israel O
and O
began O
searching O
for O
David O
and O
his O
men O
. O

They O
looked O
near O
Wild O
Goat O
Rocks O
. O

Saul O
came O
to O
some O
sheep O
pens O
beside O
the O
road O
. O

There O
was O
a O
cave O
near O
there O
, O
so O
Saul O
went O
in O
to O
relieve O
himself O
. O

David O
and O
his O
men O
were O
deep O
inside O
that O
same O
cave O
. O

David O
's O
men O
told O
him O
, O
`` O
This O
is O
day O
the O
Lord O
told O
you O
about O
when O
he O
said O
, O
' O
I O
will O
give O
your O
enemy O
to O
you O
, O
and O
you O
can O
do O
whatever O
you O
want O
to O
him O
. O
' O
'' O

So O
David O
crawled O
closer O
and O
closer O
to O
Saul O
and O
cut O
off O
a O
corner O
of O
Saul O
's O
robe O
. O

Saul O
did O
n't O
notice O
what O
happened O
. O

Later O
, O
David O
felt O
bad O
about O
what O
he O
did O
. O

He O
said O
to O
his O
men O
, O
`` O
I O
pray O
the O
Lord O
never O
lets O
me O
do O
anything O
like O
that O
to O
my O
master O
again O
. O

I O
must O
not O
do O
anything O
against O
Saul O
, O
because O
he O
is O
the O
Lord O
's O
chosen O
king O
. O
'' O

David O
said O
these O
things O
to O
stop O
his O
men O
. O

He O
would O
not O
let O
his O
men O
hurt O
Saul O
. O

Saul O
left O
the O
cave O
and O
went O
on O
his O
way O
. O

Later O
, O
David O
came O
out O
of O
the O
cave O
and O
called O
out O
to O
Saul O
, O
`` O
My O
lord O
the O
king O
! O
'' O

Saul O
looked O
back O
. O

David O
bowed O
with O
his O
face O
to O
the O
ground O
to O
show O
his O
respect O
. O

David O
said O
to O
Saul O
, O
`` O
Why O
do O
you O
listen O
when O
people O
say O
, O
' O
David O
plans O
to O
hurt O
you O
' O
? O

You O
can O
see O
that O
with O
your O
own O
eyes O
that O
is O
not O
true O
. O

The O
Lord O
put O
you O
within O
my O
grasp O
today O
in O
the O
cave O
, O
but O
I O
refused O
to O
kill O
you O
. O

I O
was O
merciful O
to O
you O
. O

I O
said O
, O
' O
I O
wo O
n't O
hurt O
my O
master O
. O

Saul O
is O
the O
Lord O
's O
chosen O
king O
. O
' O

Look O
at O
this O
piece O
of O
cloth O
in O
my O
hand O
. O

I O
cut O
off O
the O
corner O
of O
your O
robe O
. O

I O
could O
have O
killed O
you O
, O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
. O

Now O
, O
I O
want O
you O
to O
understand O
this O
. O

I O
want O
you O
to O
know O
that O
I O
am O
not O
planning O
anything O
against O
you O
. O

I O
did O
nothing O
wrong O
to O
you O
, O
but O
you O
are O
hunting O
me O
and O
trying O
to O
kill O
me O
. O

Let O
the O
Lord O
be O
the O
judge O
. O

He O
might O
punish O
you O
for O
the O
wrong O
you O
did O
to O
me O
, O
but O
I O
wo O
n't O
fight O
you O
myself O
. O

There O
is O
an O
old O
saying O
: O
' O
Bad O
things O
come O
from O
bad O
people O
. O
' O

`` O
I O
have O
n't O
done O
anything O
bad O
, O
and O
I O
wo O
n't O
hurt O
you O
. O

Who O
are O
you O
chasing O
? O

Did O
the O
king O
of O
Israel O
bring O
an O
army O
to O
chase O
a O
single O
flea O
or O
a O
dying O
dog O
? O

Let O
the O
Lord O
be O
the O
judge O
. O

Let O
him O
decide O
between O
you O
and O
me O
. O

He O
will O
support O
me O
and O
show O
that O
I O
am O
right O
. O

He O
will O
save O
me O
from O
you O
. O
'' O

When O
David O
finished O
speaking O
, O
Saul O
asked O
, O
`` O
Is O
that O
your O
voice O
, O
David O
my O
son O
? O
'' O

Then O
Saul O
lifted O
his O
voice O
and O
began O
to O
cry O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
are O
right O
, O
and O
I O
am O
wrong O
. O

You O
were O
good O
to O
me O
, O
even O
though O
I O
have O
been O
bad O
to O
you O
. O

You O
yourself O
said O
it O
when O
you O
told O
me O
about O
the O
good O
things O
you O
did O
. O

The O
Lord O
put O
my O
life O
in O
your O
hands O
, O
but O
you O
did O
not O
kill O
me O
. O

This O
shows O
that O
you O
are O
not O
my O
enemy O
. O

A O
man O
does O
n't O
catch O
his O
enemy O
and O
then O
just O
let O
him O
go O
. O

He O
does O
n't O
do O
good O
things O
for O
his O
enemy O
. O

May O
the O
Lord O
reward O
you O
for O
being O
good O
to O
me O
today O
. O

Now O
, O
I O
know O
that O
you O
will O
become O
the O
new O
king O
. O

You O
will O
rule O
the O
kingdom O
of O
Israel O
. O

Now O
make O
a O
promise O
to O
me O
. O

Use O
the O
Lord O
's O
name O
and O
promise O
that O
you O
will O
not O
kill O
my O
descendants O
, O
even O
after O
I O
die O
. O

Promise O
me O
that O
you O
will O
not O
erase O
my O
name O
from O
my O
father O
's O
family O
. O
'' O

So O
David O
made O
a O
promise O
to O
Saul O
. O

He O
promised O
that O
he O
would O
not O
kill O
Saul O
's O
family O
. O

Then O
Saul O
went O
back O
home O
. O

David O
and O
his O
men O
went O
back O
up O
to O
the O
fort O
. O

The O
Lord O
said O
to O
Samuel O
, O
`` O
How O
long O
will O
you O
feel O
sorry O
for O
Saul O
? O

I O
have O
rejected O
him O
as O
king O
of O
Israel O
. O

Fill O
your O
horn O
with O
oil O
and O
go O
to O
Bethlehem O
. O

I O
am O
sending O
you O
to O
Jesse O
who O
lives O
in O
Bethlehem O
, O
because O
I O
have O
chosen O
one O
of O
his O
sons O
to O
be O
the O
new O
king O
. O
'' O

But O
Samuel O
said O
, O
`` O
If O
I O
go O
, O
Saul O
will O
hear O
the O
news O
and O
try O
to O
kill O
me O
. O
'' O

The O
Lord O
said O
, O
`` O
Go O
to O
Bethlehem O
. O

Take O
a O
young O
calf O
with O
you O
and O
tell O
them O
, O
' O
I O
have O
come O
to O
make O
a O
sacrifice O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O
' O

Invite O
Jesse O
to O
the O
sacrifice O
. O

Then O
I O
will O
show O
you O
what O
to O
do O
. O

You O
must O
anoint O
the O
person O
I O
show O
you O
. O
'' O

Samuel O
did O
what O
the O
Lord O
told O
him O
to O
do O
and O
went O
to O
Bethlehem O
. O

The O
elders O
of O
Bethlehem O
shook O
with O
fear O
. O

They O
met O
Samuel O
and O
asked O
, O
`` O
Do O
you O
come O
in O
peace O
? O
'' O

Samuel O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
I O
come O
in O
peace O
. O

I O
come O
to O
make O
a O
sacrifice O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

Prepare O
yourselves O
and O
come O
to O
the O
sacrifice O
with O
me O
. O
'' O

Samuel O
prepared O
Jesse O
and O
his O
sons O
. O

Then O
he O
invited O
them O
to O
come O
and O
share O
the O
sacrifice O
. O

When O
Jesse O
and O
his O
sons O
arrived O
, O
Samuel O
saw O
Eliab O
and O
thought O
, O
`` O
Surely O
this O
is O
the O
man O
who O
the O
Lord O
has O
chosen O
. O
'' O

But O
the O
Lord O
said O
to O
Samuel O
, O
`` O
Eliab O
is O
tall O
and O
handsome O
, O
but O
do O
n't O
judge O
by O
things O
like O
that O
. O

God O
does O
n't O
look O
at O
what O
people O
see O
. O

People O
judge O
by O
what O
is O
on O
the O
outside O
, O
but O
the O
Lord O
looks O
at O
the O
heart O
. O

Eliab O
is O
not O
the O
right O
man O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesse O
called O
his O
second O
son O
, O
Abinadab O
. O

Abinadab O
walked O
by O
Samuel O
. O

But O
Samuel O
said O
, O
`` O
No O
, O
this O
is O
not O
the O
man O
who O
the O
Lord O
chose O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesse O
told O
Shammah O
to O
walk O
by O
Samuel O
. O

But O
Samuel O
said O
, O
`` O
No O
, O
the O
Lord O
did O
not O
choose O
this O
man O
, O
either O
. O
'' O

Jesse O
showed O
seven O
of O
his O
sons O
to O
Samuel O
. O

But O
Samuel O
said O
to O
Jesse O
, O
`` O
The O
Lord O
has O
not O
chosen O
any O
of O
these O
men O
. O
'' O

Then O
he O
asked O
Jesse O
, O
`` O
Are O
these O
all O
the O
sons O
you O
have O
? O
'' O

Jesse O
answered O
, O
`` O
No O
, O
I O
have O
another O
son O
-- O
my O
youngest O
, O
but O
he O
is O
out O
taking O
care O
of O
the O
sheep O
. O
'' O

Samuel O
said O
, O
`` O
Send O
for O
him O
. O

Bring O
him O
here O
. O

We O
wo O
n't O
sit O
down O
to O
eat O
until O
he O
arrives O
. O
'' O

Jesse O
sent O
someone O
to O
get O
his O
youngest O
son O
. O

This O
son O
was O
a O
good-looking O
, O
healthy O
young O
man O
. O

He O
was O
very O
handsome O
. O

The O
Lord O
said O
to O
Samuel O
, O
`` O
Get O
up O
and O
anoint O
him O
. O

He O
is O
the O
one O

Samuel O
took O
the O
horn O
with O
the O
oil O
in O
it O
, O
and O
poured O
the O
special O
oil O
on O
Jesse O
's O
youngest O
son O
in O
front O
of O
his O
brothers O
. O

The O
Spirit O
of O
the O
Lord O
came O
on O
David O
with O
great O
power O
from O
that O
day O
on O
. O

Then O
Samuel O
went O
back O
home O
to O
Ramah O
. O

The O
Lord O
's O
Spirit O
left O
Saul O
. O

Then O
the O
Lord O
sent O
an O
evil O
spirit O
to O
Saul O
that O
caused O
him O
much O
trouble O
. O

Saul O
's O
servants O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
An O
evil O
spirit O
from O
God O
is O
bothering O
you O

Give O
us O
the O
command O
and O
we O
will O
look O
for O
someone O
who O
can O
play O
the O
harp O

If O
the O
evil O
spirit O
from O
God O
comes O
on O
you O
, O
this O
person O
will O
play O
music O
for O
you O
. O

Then O
you O
will O
feel O
better O
. O
'' O

So O
Saul O
said O
to O
his O
servants O
, O
`` O
Find O
someone O
who O
plays O
music O
well O
and O
bring O
him O
to O
me O
. O
'' O

One O
of O
the O
servants O
said O
, O
`` O
There O
is O
a O
man O
named O
Jesse O
living O
in O
Bethlehem O
. O

I O
saw O
Jesse O
's O
son O

He O
knows O
how O
to O
play O
the O
harp O
. O

He O
is O
also O
a O
brave O
man O
and O
fights O
well O
. O

He O
is O
smart O
and O
handsome O
, O
and O
the O
Lord O
is O
with O
him O
. O
'' O

So O
Saul O
sent O
messengers O
to O
Jesse O
. O

They O
told O
Jesse O
, O
`` O
You O
have O
a O
son O
named O
David O
. O

He O
takes O
care O
of O
your O
sheep O
. O

Send O
him O
to O
me O
. O
'' O

So O
Jesse O
got O
some O
things O
as O
a O
gift O
for O
Saul O
. O

Jesse O
got O
a O
donkey O
, O
some O
bread O
and O
a O
leather O
bag O
full O
of O
wine O
, O
and O
a O
young O
goat O
. O

He O
gave O
them O
to O
David O
and O
sent O
him O
to O
Saul O
. O

So O
David O
went O
to O
Saul O
and O
stood O
in O
front O
of O
him O
. O

Saul O
loved O
David O
very O
much O
. O

David O
became O
the O
helper O
who O
carried O
Saul O

weapons O
. O

Saul O
sent O
a O
message O
to O
Jesse O
. O

`` O
Let O
David O
stay O
and O
serve O
me O

I O
like O
him O
very O
much O

'' O

Any O
time O
the O
evil O
spirit O
from O
God O
came O
on O
Saul O
, O
David O
would O
take O
his O
harp O
and O
play O
it O
. O

The O
evil O
spirit O
would O
leave O
Saul O
and O
he O
would O
begin O
to O
feel O
better O
. O

The O
Philistines O
gathered O
their O
armies O
together O
for O
war O
. O

They O
met O
at O
Socoh O
in O
Judah O
. O

Their O
camp O
was O
between O
Socoh O
and O
Azekah O
, O
at O
a O
town O
called O
Ephes O
Dammim O
. O

Saul O
and O
the O
Israelite O
soldiers O
also O
gathered O
together O
. O

Their O
camp O
was O
in O
the O
Valley O
of O
Elah O
. O

Saul O
's O
soldiers O
were O
lined O
up O
and O
ready O
to O
fight O
the O
Philistines O
. O

The O
Philistines O
were O
on O
one O
hill O
. O

The O
Israelites O
were O
on O
the O
other O
hill O
. O

The O
valley O
was O
between O
them O
. O

The O
Philistines O
had O
a O
champion O
fighter O
named O
Goliath O
, O
who O
was O
from O
Gath O
. O

He O
was O
over O
9 O
feet O
tall O
. O

Goliath O
came O
out O
of O
the O
Philistine O
camp O
. O

He O
had O
a O
bronze O
helmet O
on O
his O
head O
. O

He O
wore O
a O
coat O
of O
armor O
that O
was O
made O
like O
the O
scales O
on O
a O
fish O
. O

This O
armor O
was O
made O
of O
bronze O
and O
weighed O
about O
125 O
pounds O
. O

Goliath O
wore O
bronze O
protectors O
on O
his O
legs O
. O

He O
had O
a O
bronze O
javelin O
tied O
on O
his O
back O
. O

The O
wooden O
part O
of O
his O
spear O
was O
as O
big O
as O
a O
weaver O

rod O

The O
spear O

blade O
weighed O
15 O
pounds O

Goliath O
's O
helper O
walked O
in O
front O
of O
him O
, O
carrying O
Goliath O

shield O
. O

Each O
day O
Goliath O
would O
come O
out O
and O
shout O
a O
challenge O
to O
the O
Israelite O
soldiers O
. O

He O
would O
say O
, O
`` O
Why O
are O
all O
of O
your O
soldiers O
lined O
up O
ready O
for O
battle O
? O

You O
are O
Saul O

servants O
. O

I O
am O
a O
Philistine O
. O

So O
choose O
one O
man O
and O
send O
him O
to O
fight O
me O
. O

If O
that O
man O
kills O
me O
, O
he O
wins O
and O
we O
Philistines O
will O
become O
your O
slaves O

But O
if O
I O
kill O
your O
man O
, O
then O
I O
win O
, O
and O
you O
will O
become O
our O
slaves O

You O
will O
have O
to O
serve O
us O

'' O

The O
Philistine O
also O
said O
, O
`` O
Today O
I O
stand O
and O
make O
fun O
of O
the O
army O
of O
Israel O

I O
dare O
you O
to O
send O
me O
one O
of O
your O
men O

let O
us O
fight O

'' O

Saul O
and O
the O
Israelite O
soldiers O
heard O
what O
Goliath O
said O
, O
and O
they O
were O
very O
afraid O
. O

David O
was O
the O
son O
of O
Jesse O
. O

Jesse O
was O
from O
the O
Ephrathah O
family O
in O
Bethlehem O
, O
Judah O
. O

Jesse O
had O
eight O
sons O
. O

In O
Saul O
's O
time O
Jesse O
was O
an O
old O
man O
. O

Jesse O
's O
three O
oldest O
sons O
went O
with O
Saul O
to O
the O
war O
. O

The O
first O
son O
was O
Eliab O
, O
the O
second O
was O
Abinadab O
, O
and O
the O
third O
was O
Shammah O
. O

David O
was O
the O
youngest O
son O
. O

The O
three O
oldest O
sons O
were O
in O
Saul O
's O
army O
, O
but O
David O
left O
Saul O
from O
time O
to O
time O
to O
take O
care O
of O
his O
father O
's O
sheep O
at O
Bethlehem O
. O

The O
Philistine O
came O
out O
every O
morning O
and O
evening O
and O
stood O
before O
the O
Israelite O
army O
. O

Goliath O
insulted O
Israel O
like O
this O
for O
40 O
days O
. O

One O
day O
Jesse O
said O
to O
his O
son O
David O
, O
`` O
Take O
this O
basket O
of O
cooked O
grain O
and O
these O
ten O
loaves O
of O
bread O
to O
your O
brothers O
in O
the O
camp O
. O

Also O
take O
these O
ten O
pieces O
of O
cheese O
for O
the O
officer O
who O
commands O
your O
brothers O
' O
group O
of O
1000 O
soldiers O
. O

See O
how O
your O
brothers O
are O
doing O
. O

Bring O
back O
something O
to O
show O
me O
your O
brothers O
are O
all O
right O
. O

Your O
brothers O
are O
with O
Saul O
and O
all O
the O
Israelite O
soldiers O
in O
the O
Valley O
of O
Elah O
. O

They O
are O
there O
to O
fight O
against O
the O
Philistines O
. O
'' O

Early O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
David O
had O
another O
shepherd O
take O
care O
of O
the O
sheep O
while O
he O
took O
the O
food O
and O
left O
as O
Jesse O
had O
told O
him O
to O
. O

David O
drove O
their O
wagon O
to O
the O
camp O
. O

The O
soldiers O
were O
going O
out O
to O
their O
battle O
positions O
just O
as O
David O
arrived O
. O

The O
soldiers O
began O
shouting O
their O
war O
cry O
. O

The O
Israelites O
and O
Philistines O
were O
lined O
up O
and O
ready O
for O
battle O
. O

David O
left O
the O
food O
with O
the O
man O
who O
kept O
supplies O
. O

Then O
he O
ran O
to O
the O
place O
where O
the O
Israelite O
soldiers O
were O
and O
asked O
about O
his O
brothers O
. O

While O
David O
was O
talking O
with O
his O
brothers O
, O
the O
Philistine O
champion O
fighter O
came O
out O
from O
the O
Philistine O
army O
. O

This O
was O
Goliath O
, O
the O
Philistine O
from O
Gath O
. O

Goliath O
shouted O
things O
against O
Israel O
as O
usual O
. O

David O
heard O
what O
he O
said O
. O

The O
Israelite O
soldiers O
saw O
Goliath O
and O
ran O
away O
. O

They O
were O
all O
afraid O
of O
him O
. O

One O
of O
the O
Israelite O
men O
said O
, O
`` O
Did O
you O
see O
that O
man O
? O

Look O
at O
him O
! O

He O
comes O
out O
each O
day O
and O
makes O
fun O
of O
Israel O
. O

Whoever O
kills O
him O
will O
get O
rich O
. O

King O
Saul O
will O
give O
him O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
. O

Saul O
will O
also O
let O
his O
daughter O
marry O
the O
man O
who O
kills O
Goliath O
. O

He O
will O
also O
make O
that O
man O
's O
family O
free O
from O
taxes O
in O
Israel O
. O
'' O

David O
asked O
the O
men O
standing O
near O
him O
, O
`` O
What O
did O
he O
say O
? O

What O
is O
the O
reward O
for O
killing O
this O
Philistine O
and O
taking O
away O
this O
shame O
from O
Israel O
? O

Who O
is O
this O
Goliath O
anyway O
? O

He O
is O
only O
some O
foreigner O
, O
nothing O
but O
a O
Philistine O
. O

Why O
does O
he O
think O
he O
can O
speak O
against O
the O
army O
of O
the O
living O
God O
? O
'' O

So O
the O
Israelite O
told O
David O
about O
the O
reward O
for O
killing O
Goliath O
. O

David O
's O
oldest O
brother O
Eliab O
heard O
David O
talking O
with O
the O
soldiers O
and O
became O
angry O
. O

Eliab O
asked O
David O
, O
`` O
Why O
did O
you O
come O
here O
? O

Who O
did O
you O
leave O
those O
few O
sheep O
with O
in O
the O
desert O
? O

I O
know O
why O
you O
came O
down O
here O
. O

You O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
do O
what O
you O
were O
told O
to O
do O
. O

You O
just O
wanted O
to O
come O
down O
here O
to O
watch O
the O
battle O
. O
'' O

David O
said O
, O
`` O
What O
did O
I O
do O
now O
? O

I O
did O
n't O
do O
anything O
wrong O
! O

I O
was O
only O
talking O
. O
'' O

He O
turned O
to O
some O
other O
people O
and O
asked O
them O
the O
same O
questions O
. O

They O
gave O
him O
the O
same O
answers O
as O
before O
. O

Some O
men O
heard O
David O
talking O
. O

They O
took O
David O
to O
Saul O
and O
told O
him O
what O
David O
had O
said O
. O

David O
said O
to O
Saul O
, O
`` O
People O
should O
n't O
let O
Goliath O
discourage O
them O
. O

I O
am O
your O
servant O
. O

I O
will O
go O
fight O
this O
Philistine O
. O
'' O

Saul O
answered O
, O
`` O
You O
ca O
n't O
go O
out O
and O
fight O
against O
this O
Philistine O
. O

You O
're O
not O
even O
a O
soldier O
! O

Goliath O
has O
been O
fighting O
in O
wars O
since O
he O
was O
a O
boy O
. O
'' O

But O
David O
said O
to O
Saul O
, O
`` O
There O
were O
times O
when O
I O
was O
taking O
care O
of O
my O
father O
's O
sheep O
that O
wild O
animals O
came O
to O
take O
some O
sheep O
from O
the O
flock O
. O

Once O
there O
was O
a O
lion O
and O
another O
time O
, O
a O
bear O
. O

I O
chased O
that O
wild O
animal O
, O
attacked O
it O
, O
and O
took O
the O
sheep O
from O
its O
mouth O
. O

The O
wild O
animal O
jumped O
on O
me O
, O
but O
I O
caught O
it O
by O
the O
fur O
under O
its O
mouth O
. O

And O
I O
hit O
it O
and O
killed O
it O
. O

I O
killed O
both O
a O
lion O
and O
a O
bear O
like O
that O
! O

And O
I O
will O
kill O
that O
foreigner O
, O
Goliath O
, O
just O
like O
them O
. O

Goliath O
will O
die O
because O
he O
made O
fun O
of O
the O
army O
of O
the O
living O
God O
. O

The O
Lord O
saved O
me O
from O
the O
lion O
and O
the O
bear O
. O

He O
will O
also O
save O
me O
from O
this O
Philistine O
. O
'' O

Saul O
said O
to O
David O
, O
`` O
Go O
and O
may O
the O
Lord O
be O
with O
you O
. O
'' O

Saul O
put O
his O
own O
clothes O
on O
David O
. O

He O
put O
a O
bronze O
helmet O
on O
David O
's O
head O
and O
armor O
on O
his O
body O
. O

David O
put O
on O
the O
sword O
and O
tried O
to O
walk O
around O
. O

He O
tried O
to O
wear O
Saul O
's O
uniform O
, O
but O
David O
was O
not O
used O
to O
all O
those O
heavy O
things O
. O

David O
said O
to O
Saul O
, O
`` O
I O
ca O
n't O
fight O
in O
these O
things O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
used O
to O
them O
. O
'' O

So O
David O
took O
them O
all O
off O
. O

He O
took O
his O
walking O
stick O
in O
his O
hand O
and O
went O
to O
find O
five O
smooth O
stones O
from O
the O
stream O
. O

He O
put O
the O
five O
stones O
in O
his O
shepherd O
's O
bag O
and O
held O
his O
sling O
in O
his O
hand O
. O

Then O
he O
went O
out O
to O
meet O
the O
Philistine O
. O

The O
Philistine O
slowly O
walked O
closer O
and O
closer O
to O
David O
. O

Goliath O
's O
helper O
walked O
in O
front O
of O
him O
, O
carrying O
a O
large O
shield O
. O

Goliath O
looked O
at O
David O
with O
disgust O
. O

He O
saw O
that O
David O
was O
only O
a O
handsome O
, O
healthy O
boy O
. O

Goliath O
said O
to O
David O
, O
`` O
What O
is O
that O
stick O
for O
? O

Did O
you O
come O
to O
chase O
me O
away O
like O
a O
dog O
? O
'' O

Then O
Goliath O
used O
the O
names O
of O
his O
gods O
to O
say O
curses O
against O
David O
. O

He O
said O
to O
David O
, O
`` O
Come O
here O
, O
and O
I O
'll O
feed O
your O
body O
to O
the O
birds O
and O
wild O
animals O
. O
'' O

David O
said O
to O
the O
Philistine O
, O
`` O
You O
come O
to O
me O
using O
sword O
, O
spear O
, O
and O
javelin O

But O
I O
come O
to O
you O
in O
the O
name O
of O
the O
Lord O
All-Powerful O
, O
the O
God O
of O
the O
armies O
of O
Israel O

You O
have O
said O
bad O
things O
about O
him O

Today O
the O
Lord O
will O
let O
me O
defeat O
you O

I O
will O
kill O
you O

I O
will O
cut O
off O
your O
head O
and O
feed O
your O
body O
to O
the O
birds O
and O
wild O
animals O
. O

And O
we O
will O
do O
the O
same O
thing O
to O
all O
the O
other O
Philistines O
too O
. O

Then O
all O
the O
world O
will O
know O
there O
is O
a O
God O
in O
Israel O
. O

All O
the O
people O
gathered O
here O
will O
know O
that O
the O
Lord O
does O
n't O
need O
swords O
or O

save O
people O

The O
battle O
belongs O
to O
the O
Lord O
, O
and O
he O
will O
help O
us O
defeat O
all O
of O
you O

'' O

Goliath O
the O
Philistine O
started O
to O
attack O
David O
. O

He O
slowly O
walked O
closer O
and O
closer O
toward O
David O
, O
but O
David O
ran O
out O
to O
meet O
Goliath O
. O

David O
took O
out O
a O
stone O
from O
his O
bag O
. O

He O
put O
it O
in O
his O
sling O
and O
swung O
the O
sling O

The O
stone O
flew O
from O
the O
sling O
and O
hit O
Goliath O
right O
between O
the O
eyes O
. O

The O
stone O
sank O
deep O
into O
his O
head O
, O
and O
Goliath O
fell O
to O
the O
ground O
-- O
face O
down O
. O

So O
David O
defeated O
the O
Philistine O
with O
only O
a O
sling O
and O
one O
stone O
! O

He O
hit O
the O
Philistine O
and O
killed O
him O
. O

David O
did O
n't O
have O
a O
sword O
, O
so O
he O
ran O
and O
stood O
beside O
the O
Philistine O
. O

Then O
David O
took O
Goliath O
's O
own O
sword O
out O
of O
its O
sheath O
and O
used O
it O
to O
cut O
off O
his O
head O
. O

That O
is O
how O
David O
killed O
the O
Philistine O
. O

When O
the O
other O
Philistines O
saw O
their O
hero O
was O
dead O
, O
they O
turned O
and O
ran O
. O

The O
soldiers O
of O
Israel O
and O
Judah O
shouted O
and O
started O
chasing O
the O
Philistines O
. O

The O
Israelites O
chased O
them O
all O
the O
way O
to O
the O
city O
limits O
of O
Gath O
and O
to O
the O
gates O
of O
Ekron O
. O

They O
killed O
many O
of O
the O
Philistines O
. O

Their O
bodies O
were O
scattered O
along O
the O
Shaaraim O
road O
all O
the O
way O
to O
Gath O
and O
Ekron O
. O

After O
chasing O
the O
Philistines O
, O
the O
Israelites O
came O
back O
to O
the O
Philistine O
camp O
and O
took O
many O
things O
from O
that O
camp O
. O

David O
took O
the O
Philistine O
's O
head O
to O
Jerusalem O
, O
but O
he O
kept O
the O
Philistine O
's O
weapons O
at O
home O
. O

Saul O
watched O
David O
go O
out O
to O
fight O
Goliath O
. O

Saul O
spoke O
to O
Abner O
, O
the O
commander O
of O
the O
army O
. O

`` O
Abner O
, O
who O
is O
that O
young O
man O
's O
father O
? O
'' O

Abner O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
swear O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
sir O
. O
'' O

King O
Saul O
said O
, O
`` O
Find O
out O
who O
his O
father O
is O
. O
'' O

When O
David O
came O
back O
after O
killing O
Goliath O
, O
Abner O
brought O
him O
to O
Saul O
. O

David O
was O
still O
holding O
the O
Philistine O
's O
head O
. O

Saul O
asked O
him O
, O
`` O
Young O
man O
, O
who O
is O
your O
father O
? O
'' O

David O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
the O
son O
of O
your O
servant O
Jesse O
, O
from O
Bethlehem O
. O
'' O

David O
left O
Gath O
and O
ran O
away O
to O
the O
cave O
of O
Adullam O
. O

David O
's O
brothers O
and O
relatives O
heard O
that O
David O
was O
at O
Adullam O
and O
went O
to O
see O
him O
there O
. O

Many O
people O
joined O
David O
. O

There O
were O
men O
who O
were O
in O
some O
kind O
of O
trouble O
, O
men O
who O
owed O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
, O
and O
men O
who O
were O
just O
not O
satisfied O
with O
life O
. O

All O
kinds O
of O
people O
joined O
David O
, O
and O
he O
became O
their O
leader O
. O

He O
had O
about O
400 O
men O
with O
him O
. O

David O
left O
Adullam O
and O
went O
to O
Mizpah O
in O
Moab O
. O

David O
said O
to O
the O
king O
of O
Moab O
, O
`` O
Please O
let O
my O
father O
and O
mother O
come O
and O
stay O
with O
you O
until O
I O
learn O
what O
God O
is O
going O
to O
do O
to O
me O
. O
'' O

So O
David O
left O
his O
parents O
with O
the O
king O
of O
Moab O
. O

They O
stayed O
with O
the O
king O
of O
Moab O
as O
long O
as O
David O
was O
at O
the O
fort O
. O

But O
the O
prophet O
Gad O
said O
to O
David O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
stay O
in O
the O
fort O
. O

Go O
to O
the O
land O
of O
Judah O
. O
'' O

So O
David O
left O
and O
went O
to O
Hereth O
Forest O
. O

Saul O
heard O
the O
report O
about O
David O
and O
his O
men O
while O
sitting O
under O
the O
tree O
on O
the O
hill O
at O
Gibeah O
. O

Saul O
had O
his O
spear O
in O
his O
hand O
. O

All O
of O
his O
officers O
were O
standing O
around O
him O
. O

Saul O
said O
to O
his O
officers O
who O
were O
standing O
around O
him O
, O
`` O
Listen O
, O
men O
of O
Benjamin O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
the O
son O
of O
Jesse O
-LRB- O
David O
-RRB- O
will O
give O
you O
fields O
and O
vineyards O
? O

Do O
you O
think O
he O
will O
promote O
you O
and O
make O
you O
officers O
over O
1000 O
men O
and O
officers O
over O
100 O
men O
? O

No O
, O
but O
all O
of O
you O
are O
plotting O
against O
me O
. O

None O
of O
you O
told O
me O
about O
my O
son O
Jonathan O
and O
the O
agreement O
he O
made O
with O
the O
son O
of O
Jesse O
. O

None O
of O
you O
cares O
enough O
about O
me O
to O
tell O
me O
that O
my O
own O
son O
Jonathan O
encouraged O
David O
to O
turn O
against O
me O
and O
attack O
me O
. O

And O
that O
is O
what O
David O
is O
doing O
now O
. O
'' O

Doeg O
the O
Edomite O
was O
standing O
there O
with O
Saul O
's O
officers O
. O

Doeg O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
saw O
Jesse O
's O
son O
at O
Nob O
. O

David O
came O
to O
see O
Ahimelech O
son O
of O
Ahitub O
. O

Ahimelech O
prayed O
to O
the O
Lord O
for O
David O
and O
gave O
him O
some O
food O
. O

He O
even O
gave O
David O
the O
sword O
of O
Goliath O
the O
Philistine O
. O
'' O

Then O
King O
Saul O
ordered O
some O
men O
to O
bring O
the O
priest O
to O
him O
. O

Saul O
told O
them O
to O
bring O
Ahimelech O
son O
of O
Ahitub O
and O
all O
his O
relatives O
who O
were O
priests O
at O
Nob O
. O

So O
all O
of O
them O
came O
to O
the O
king O
. O

Saul O
said O
to O
Ahimelech O
, O
`` O
Listen O
now O
, O
son O
of O
Ahitub O
. O
'' O

Ahimelech O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
sir O

'' O

Saul O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Why O
did O
you O
and O
Jesse O
's O
son O
make O
secret O
plans O
against O
me O
? O

You O
gave O
David O
bread O
and O
a O
sword O
. O

You O
prayed O
to O
God O
for O
him O
. O

And O
right O
now O
, O
David O
is O
waiting O
to O
attack O
me O
. O
'' O

Ahimelech O
answered O
, O
`` O
David O
is O
very O
faithful O
to O
you O
. O

Not O
one O
of O
your O
other O
officers O
is O
as O
faithful O
as O
David O
. O

He O
is O
your O
own O
son-in-law O
and O
the O
captain O
of O
your O
bodyguards O
. O

Your O
own O
family O
respects O
David O
. O

That O
was O
not O
the O
first O
time O
I O
prayed O
to O
God O
for O
David O
. O

Not O
at O
all O
! O

Do O
n't O
blame O
me O
or O
any O
of O
my O
relatives O
. O

We O
are O
your O
servants O
. O

I O
know O
nothing O
about O
what O
is O
happening O
. O
'' O

But O
the O
king O
said O
, O
`` O
Ahimelech O
, O
you O
and O
all O
your O
relatives O
must O
die O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
king O
told O
the O
guards O
at O
his O
side O
, O
`` O
Go O
and O
kill O
the O
priests O
of O
the O
Lord O
because O
they O
are O
on O
David O

side O
too O
. O

They O
knew O
he O
was O
running O
away O
, O
but O
they O
did O
n't O
tell O
me O
. O
'' O

The O
king O
's O
officers O
refused O
to O
hurt O
the O
priests O
of O
the O
Lord O
. O

So O
the O
king O
gave O
the O
order O
to O
Doeg O
. O

Saul O
said O
, O
`` O
Doeg O
, O
you O
go O
kill O
the O
priests O
. O
'' O

So O
Doeg O
the O
Edomite O
went O
and O
killed O
the O
priests O
. O

That O
day O
he O
killed O
85 O
men O
who O
were O
priests O
. O

Nob O
was O
the O
city O
of O
the O
priests O
. O

Doeg O
killed O
all O
the O
people O
of O
Nob O
. O

He O
used O
his O
sword O
and O
killed O
men O
, O
women O
, O
children O
and O
small O
babies O
. O

He O
even O
killed O
their O
cattle O
, O
donkeys O
, O
and O
sheep O
. O

But O
Abiathar O
son O
of O
Ahimelech O
escaped O
. O

He O
ran O
away O
and O
joined O
David O
. O

Abiathar O
told O
David O
that O
Saul O
had O
killed O
the O
Lord O
's O
priests O
. O

Then O
David O
told O
Abiathar O
, O
`` O
I O
saw O
Doeg O
the O
Edomite O
at O
Nob O
that O
day O
. O

I O
knew O
he O
would O
tell O
Saul O
! O

I O
am O
responsible O
for O
the O
death O
of O
your O
father O
's O
family O
. O

Stay O
with O
me O
. O

Do O
n't O
be O
afraid O
, O
because O
the O
man O
-LRB- O
Saul O
-RRB- O
who O
tried O
to O
kill O
you O
is O
the O
same O
man O
who O
wants O
to O
kill O
me O
. O

I O
will O
protect O
you O
if O
you O
stay O
with O
me O
. O
'' O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
Philistines O
fought O
against O
the O
Israelites O
, O
and O
the O
Israelites O
ran O
from O
them O
. O

There O
were O
many O
dead O
bodies O
that O
fell O
at O
Mount O
Gilboa O
. O

The O
Philistines O
fought O
hard O
against O
Saul O
and O
his O
sons O
. O

They O
killed O
Jonathan O
, O
Abinadab O
, O
and O
Malki O
Shua O
. O

The O
battle O
grew O
even O
more O
intense O
around O
Saul O
. O

The O
archers O
closed O
in O
on O
Saul O
and O
wounded O
him O
with O
many O
arrows O
. O

Saul O
told O
the O
boy O
who O
carried O
his O
armor O
, O
`` O
Take O
your O
sword O
and O
kill O
me O
or O
else O
these O
foreigners O
will O
do O
it O
and O
torment O
me O
as O
well O
! O
'' O

But O
Saul O
's O
helper O
was O
afraid O
and O
refused O
to O
kill O
him O
. O

So O
Saul O
took O
out O
his O
own O
sword O
and O
fell O
on O
it O
. O

When O
the O
helper O
saw O
that O
Saul O
was O
dead O
, O
he O
took O
out O
his O
own O
sword O
, O
fell O
on O
it O
, O
and O
died O
there O
with O
Saul O
. O

So O
Saul O
, O
his O
three O
sons O
, O
and O
the O
boy O
who O
carried O
his O
armor O
all O
died O
together O
that O
day O
. O

The O
Israelites O
who O
lived O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
valley O
saw O
the O
Israelite O
army O
running O
away O
. O

They O
saw O
that O
Saul O
and O
his O
sons O
were O
dead O
, O
so O
they O
left O
their O
cities O
and O
ran O
away O
. O

Then O
the O
Philistines O
came O
and O
lived O
in O
their O
cities O
. O

The O
next O
day O
, O
the O
Philistines O
went O
back O
to O
take O
things O
from O
the O
dead O
bodies O
. O

They O
found O
Saul O
and O
his O
three O
sons O
dead O
on O
Mount O
Gilboa O
. O

The O
Philistines O
cut O
off O
Saul O
's O
head O
and O
took O
all O
his O
armor O
. O

They O
carried O
the O
news O
to O
the O
Philistines O
and O
to O
all O
the O
temples O
of O
their O
idols O
. O

They O
put O
Saul O
's O
armor O
in O
the O
temple O
of O
Ashtoreth O
. O

The O
Philistines O
also O
hung O
Saul O
's O
body O
on O
the O
wall O
of O
Beth O
Shan O
. O

The O
people O
living O
in O
Jabesh O
Gilead O
heard O
what O
the O
Philistines O
did O
to O
Saul O
. O

So O
all O
the O
soldiers O
of O
Jabesh O
went O
to O
Beth O
Shan O
. O

They O
marched O
all O
night O
, O
went O
to O
the O
wall O
of O
Beth O
Shan O
, O
and O
took O
down O
the O
bodies O
of O
Saul O
and O
his O
sons O
. O

Then O
they O
carried O
them O
to O
Jabesh O
. O

There O
the O
people O
of O
Jabesh O
burned O
the O
bodies O
of O
Saul O
and O
his O
three O
sons O
. O

Later O
, O
they O
buried O
the O
bones O
of O
Saul O
and O
his O
three O
sons O
under O
the O
big O
tree O
in O
Jabesh O
. O

Then O
the O
people O
of O
Jabesh O
showed O
their O
sadness O
-- O
they O
did O
not O
eat O
for O
seven O
days O
. O

Samuel O
said O
to O
all O
Israel O
: O
`` O
I O
have O
done O
everything O
you O
wanted O
me O
to O
do O

I O
have O
put O
a O
king O

you O

Now O
you O
have O
a O
king O
to O
lead O
you O
. O

I O
am O
old O
and O
gray O
, O
but O
my O
sons O
are O
here O
with O
you O

I O
have O
been O
your O
leader O
since O
I O
was O
young O
. O

Here O
I O
am O

If O
I O
have O
done O
anything O
wrong O
, O
you O
must O
tell O
these O
things O
to O
the O
Lord O
and O
his O
chosen O
king O

Did O
I O
steal O
anyone O
's O
ox O
or O
donkey O
? O

Did O
I O
hurt O
or O
cheat O
anyone O
? O

Did O
I O
ever O
take O
money O
, O
or O
even O
a O
pair O
of O
sandals O
, O
to O
do O
something O
wrong O
? O

If O
I O
did O
any O
of O
these O
things O
, O
I O
will O
make O
it O
right O

The O
Israelites O
answered O
, O
`` O
No O

you O
never O
did O
anything O
bad O
to O
us O
. O

You O
never O
cheated O
us O

took O
things O

Samuel O
said O
to O
the O
Israelites O
, O
`` O
The O
Lord O

The O
people O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O

Lord O

Then O
Samuel O

to O
the O
people O

`` O
The O

Aaron O

brought O
your O

Now O

stand O
there O

I O
will O

`` O
Jacob O
went O
to O
Egypt O

Later O

the O

made O
life O
hard O

So O
they O
cried O
to O
the O
Lord O
for O
help O

The O
Lord O
sent O
Moses O

Aaron O

they O
took O

`` O
But O
your O

them O
become O
the O

of O
Sisera O

the O
commander O

Hazor O

the O
Lord O
let O

the O
Philistines O

the O
king O
of O
Moab O

all O
fought O
against O

your O

They O
said O

Jephthah O
, O
and O
Samuel O
. O

He O
saved O
you O
from O
your O
enemies O
around O
you O
, O
and O
you O
lived O
in O
safety O
. O

But O
then O
you O
saw O
King O
Nahash O
of O
the O
Ammonites O
coming O
to O
fight O
against O
you O
. O

You O
said O
, O
' O
No O
, O
we O
want O
a O
king O
to O
rule O
over O
us O
! O
' O

You O
said O
that O
, O
even O
though O
the O
Lord O
your O
God O
was O
already O
your O
king O
. O

Now O
, O
here O
is O
the O
king O
you O
chose O
. O

The O
Lord O
put O
this O
king O
over O
you O
. O

You O
must O
fear O
and O
respect O
the O
Lord O
. O

You O
must O
serve O
him O
and O
obey O
his O
commands O
. O

You O
must O
not O
turn O
against O
him O
. O

You O
and O
the O
king O
ruling O
over O
you O
must O
follow O
the O
Lord O
your O
God O
. O

If O
you O
do O
, O
God O
will O
save O
you O
. O

But O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
obey O
the O
Lord O
, O
and O
if O
you O
turn O
against O
him O
, O
he O
will O
be O
against O
you O
. O

The O
Lord O
will O
destroy O
you O
and O
your O
king O
. O

`` O
Now O
stand O
still O
and O
see O
the O
great O
thing O
the O
Lord O
will O
do O
before O
your O
eyes O
. O

Now O
is O
the O
time O
of O
the O
wheat O
harvest O
. O

I O
will O
pray O
to O
the O
Lord O
and O
ask O
him O
to O
send O
thunder O
and O
rain O
. O

Then O
you O
will O
know O
you O
did O
a O
very O
bad O
thing O
against O
the O
Lord O
when O
you O
asked O
for O
a O
king O
. O
'' O

So O
Samuel O
prayed O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

That O
same O
day O
the O
Lord O
sent O
thunder O
and O
rain O
. O

And O
the O
people O
became O
very O
afraid O
of O
the O
Lord O
and O
Samuel O
. O

All O
the O
people O
said O
to O
Samuel O
, O
`` O
Pray O
to O
the O
Lord O
your O
God O
for O
us O
, O
your O
servants O
. O

Do O
n't O
let O
us O
die O
! O

We O
have O
sinned O
many O
times O
. O

And O
now O
we O
have O
added O
to O
these O
sins O
-- O
we O
have O
asked O
for O
a O
king O
. O
'' O

Samuel O
answered O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
be O
afraid O
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
you O
did O
all O
these O
bad O
things O
, O
but O
do O
n't O
stop O
following O
the O
Lord O
. O

Serve O
the O
Lord O
with O
all O
your O
heart O
. O

Idols O
are O
only O
statues O
-- O
they O
ca O
n't O
help O
you O
. O

So O
do O
n't O
worship O
them O
. O

Idols O
ca O
n't O
help O
you O
or O
save O
you O
. O

They O
are O
nothing O
! O

`` O
But O
the O
Lord O
wo O
n't O
leave O
his O
people O
. O

No O
, O
the O
Lord O
was O
pleased O
to O
make O
you O
his O
own O
people O
. O

So O
for O
his O
own O
good O
name O
, O
he O
wo O
n't O
leave O
you O
. O

And O
as O
for O
me O
, O
I O
would O
never O
stop O
praying O
for O
you O
. O

If O
I O
stopped O
praying O
for O
you O
, O
I O
would O
be O
sinning O
against O
the O
Lord O
. O

I O
will O
continue O
to O
teach O
you O
the O
right O
way O
to O
live O
a O
good O
life O
. O

But O
you O
must O
honor O
the O
Lord O
. O

You O
must O
sincerely O
serve O
the O
Lord O
with O
all O
your O
heart O
. O

Remember O
the O
wonderful O
things O
he O
did O
for O
you O
. O

But O
if O
you O
are O
stubborn O
and O
do O
evil O
, O
God O
will O
throw O
you O
and O
your O
king O
away O
-- O
like O
sweeping O
dirt O
out O
with O
a O
broom O
. O
'' O

Saul O
decided O
to O
take O
David O
with O
him O
. O

He O
would O
not O
let O
David O
go O
back O
home O
to O
his O
father O
. O

After O
David O
finished O
talking O
with O
Saul O
, O
Jonathan O
developed O
a O
strong O
friendship O
with O
David O
. O

Jonathan O
loved O
David O
as O
much O
as O
himself O
, O
so O
they O
made O
a O
special O
agreement O
. O

Jonathan O
took O
off O
the O
coat O
he O
was O
wearing O
and O
gave O
it O
to O
David O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
Jonathan O
gave O
David O
his O
whole O
uniform O
-- O
including O
his O
sword O
, O
his O
bow O
, O
and O
even O
his O
belt O
. O

David O
went O
to O
fight O
wherever O
Saul O
sent O
him O
. O

He O
was O
very O
successful O
, O
so O
Saul O
put O
him O
in O
charge O
of O
the O
soldiers O
. O

This O
pleased O
everyone O
, O
even O
Saul O
's O
officers O
. O

David O
would O
go O
out O
to O
fight O
against O
the O
Philistines O
. O

On O
the O
way O
home O
after O
the O
battles O
, O
women O
in O
every O
town O
in O
Israel O
would O
come O
out O
to O
meet O
him O
. O

They O
sang O
and O
danced O
for O
joy O
as O
they O
played O
their O
tambourines O
and O
lyres O
. O

They O
did O
this O
right O
in O
front O
of O
Saul O
! O

The O
women O
sang O
, O
`` O
Saul O
has O
killed O
his O
thousands O
, O
but O
David O
has O
killed O
tens O
of O
thousands O
. O
'' O

This O
song O
upset O
Saul O
and O
he O
became O
very O
angry O
. O

Saul O
thought O
, O
`` O
The O
women O
give O
David O
credit O
for O
killing O
tens O
of O
thousands O
of O
the O
enemy O
, O
and O
they O
give O
me O
credit O
for O
only O
thousands O
. O

A O
little O
more O
of O
this O
and O
they O
will O
give O
him O
the O
kingdom O
itself O
! O
'' O

So O
from O
that O
time O
on O
, O
Saul O
watched O
David O
very O
closely O
. O

The O
next O
day O
, O
an O
evil O
spirit O
from O
God O
took O
control O
of O
Saul O
and O
he O
went O
wild O
in O
his O
house O
. O

David O
played O
the O
harp O
to O
calm O
him O
as O
he O
usually O
did O
, O
but O
Saul O
had O
a O
spear O
in O
his O
hand O
. O

He O
thought O
, O
`` O
I O
'll O
pin O
David O
to O
the O
wall O
. O
'' O

Saul O
threw O
the O
spear O
twice O
, O
but O
David O
jumped O
out O
of O
the O
way O
both O
times O
. O

The O
Lord O
had O
left O
Saul O
and O
was O
now O
with O
David O
, O
so O
Saul O
was O
afraid O
of O
David O
. O

Saul O
sent O
David O
away O
and O
made O
him O
a O
commander O
over O
1000 O
soldiers O
. O

This O
put O
David O
out O
among O
the O
men O
even O
more O
as O
they O
went O
into O
battle O
and O
returned O
. O

The O
Lord O
was O
with O
David O
, O
so O
he O
was O
successful O
in O
everything O
. O

Saul O
saw O
how O
successful O
David O
was O
and O
became O
even O
more O
afraid O
of O
him O
. O

But O
all O
the O
people O
in O
Israel O
and O
Judah O
loved O
David O
because O
he O
was O
out O
among O
them O
and O
led O
them O
into O
battle O
. O

One O
day O
, O
Saul O
said O
to O
David O
, O
`` O
Here O
is O
my O
oldest O
daughter O
, O
Merab O
. O

I O
will O
let O
you O
marry O
her O
. O

Then O
you O
will O
be O
like O
a O
son O
to O
me O
and O
you O
will O
be O
a O
real O
soldier O
. O

Then O
you O
will O
go O
and O
fight O
the O
Lord O
's O
battles O
. O
'' O

Saul O
was O
really O
thinking O
, O
`` O
Now O
I O
wo O
n't O
have O
to O
kill O
David O
. O

I O
will O
let O
the O
Philistines O
kill O
him O
for O
me O
. O
'' O

But O
David O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
not O
an O
important O
man O
from O
an O
important O
family O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
marry O
the O
king O
's O
daughter O
. O
'' O

So O
when O
the O
time O
came O
for O
David O
to O
marry O
Saul O
's O
daughter O
, O
Saul O
let O
her O
marry O
Adriel O
from O
Meholah O
. O

People O
told O
Saul O
that O
his O
daughter O
Michal O
loved O
David O
. O

This O
made O
Saul O
happy O
. O

He O
thought O
, O
`` O
I O
will O
use O
Michal O
to O
trap O
David O
. O

I O
will O
let O
Michal O
marry O
David O
, O
and O
then O
I O
will O
let O
the O
Philistines O
kill O
him O
. O
'' O

So O
Saul O
said O
to O
David O
a O
second O
time O
, O
`` O
You O
can O
marry O
my O
daughter O
today O
. O
'' O

Saul O
commanded O
his O
officers O
to O
speak O
to O
David O
in O
private O
. O

He O
told O
them O
to O
say O
, O
`` O
Look O
, O
the O
king O
likes O
you O
. O

His O
officers O
like O
you O
. O

You O
should O
marry O
his O
daughter O
. O
'' O

Saul O
's O
officers O
said O
these O
things O
to O
David O
, O
but O
David O
answered O
, O
`` O
Do O
you O
think O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
become O
the O
king O
's O
son-in-law O
? O

I O
am O
just O
a O
poor O
, O
ordinary O
man O
. O
'' O

Saul O
's O
officers O
told O
Saul O
what O
David O
said O
. O

Saul O
told O
them O
, O
`` O
Say O
this O
to O
David O
, O
' O
David O
, O
the O
king O
does O
n't O
want O
you O
to O
pay O
money O
for O
his O
daughter O
. O

He O
wants O
to O
get O
even O
with O
his O
enemy O
, O
so O
the O
price O
for O
marrying O
his O
daughter O
is O
100 O
Philistine O
foreskins O
. O
' O
'' O

That O
was O
Saul O
's O
secret O
plan O
. O

He O
thought O
the O
Philistines O
would O
kill O
David O
. O

Saul O
's O
officers O
told O
this O
to O
David O
. O

David O
was O
happy O
that O
he O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
become O
the O
king O
's O
son-in-law O
, O
so O
immediately O
he O
and O
his O
men O
went O
out O
to O
fight O
the O
Philistines O
. O

They O
killed O
200 O
Philistines O
. O

David O
took O
these O
Philistine O
foreskins O
and O
gave O
them O
to O
Saul O
. O

He O
did O
this O
because O
he O
wanted O
to O
become O
the O
king O
's O
son-in-law O
. O

Saul O
let O
David O
marry O
his O
daughter O
Michal O
. O

He O
saw O
that O
the O
Lord O
was O
with O
David O
and O
he O
also O
saw O
that O
his O
daughter O
, O
Michal O
, O
loved O
David O
. O

So O
Saul O
became O
even O
more O
afraid O
of O
David O
and O
was O
against O
him O
all O
that O
time O
. O

The O
Philistine O
commanders O
continued O
to O
go O
out O
to O
fight O
the O
Israelites O
, O
but O
David O
defeated O
them O
every O
time O
. O

He O
became O
famous O
as O
Saul O
's O
best O
officer O
. O

That O
day O
, O
Saul O
's O
son O
Jonathan O
was O
talking O
with O
the O
young O
man O
who O
carried O
his O
weapons O
. O

Jonathan O
said O
, O
`` O
Let O
's O
go O
to O
the O
Philistine O
camp O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
valley O
. O
'' O

But O
Jonathan O
did O
not O
tell O
his O
father O
. O

Saul O
was O
sitting O
under O
a O
pomegranate O
tree O
at O
the O
threshing O
floor O
at O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
hill O
. O

Saul O
had O
about O
600 O
men O
with O
him O
. O

One O
of O
the O
men O
was O
named O
Ahijah O
. O

Ahijah O
was O
a O
son O
of O
Ichabod O
's O
brother O
Ahitub O
. O

Ahitub O
was O
the O
son O
of O
Phinehas O
. O

Phinehas O
was O
the O
son O
of O
Eli O
. O

Eli O
had O
been O
the O
Lord O
's O
priest O
at O
Shiloh O
. O

Now O
Ahijah O
was O
the O
priest O
who O
wore O
the O
ephod O
. O

These O
men O
did O
not O
know O
that O
Jonathan O
had O
left O
. O

Jonathan O
was O
planning O
to O
go O
through O
a O
pass O
to O
get O
to O
the O
Philistine O
camp O
. O

There O
was O
a O
large O
rock O
on O
each O
side O
of O
the O
pass O
. O

The O
large O
rock O
on O
one O
side O
was O
named O
Bozez O
. O

The O
large O
rock O
on O
the O
other O
side O
was O
named O
Seneh O
. O

One O
of O
the O
rocks O
faced O
north O
toward O
Micmash O
, O
and O
the O
other O
faced O
south O
toward O
Geba O
. O

Jonathan O
said O
to O
his O
young O
helper O
who O
carried O
his O
weapons O
, O
`` O
Come O
on O
, O
let O
's O
go O
to O
the O
camp O
of O
those O
foreigners O
. O

Maybe O
the O
Lord O
will O
use O
us O
to O
defeat O
them O
. O

Nothing O
can O
stop O
the O
Lord O
-- O
it O
does O
n't O
matter O
if O
we O
have O
many O
soldiers O
or O
just O
a O
few O
soldiers O
. O
'' O

The O
young O
man O
who O
carried O
Jonathan O
's O
weapons O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Do O
what O
you O
think O
is O
best O
. O

Whatever O
you O
decide O
, O
I O
am O
with O
you O
all O
the O
way O
. O
'' O

Jonathan O
said O
, O
`` O
Let O
's O
go O
! O

We O
'll O
cross O
the O
valley O
and O
go O
to O
the O
Philistine O
guards O
. O

We O
'll O
let O
them O
see O
us O
. O

If O
they O
say O
to O
us O
, O
' O
Stay O
there O
until O
we O
come O
to O
you O
, O
' O
we O
will O
stay O
where O
we O
are O
. O

We O
wo O
n't O
go O
up O
to O
them O
. O

But O
if O
the O
Philistine O
men O
say O
, O
' O
Come O
up O
here O
, O
' O
then O
we O
will O
climb O
up O
to O
them O
. O

That O
will O
be O
a O
sign O
from O
God O
. O

That O
will O
mean O
that O
the O
Lord O
will O
allow O
us O
to O
defeat O
them O

'' O

So O
Jonathan O
and O
his O
helper O
let O
the O
Philistines O
see O
them O
. O

The O
Philistine O
guards O
said O
, O
`` O
Look O
! O

The O
Hebrews O
are O
coming O
out O
of O
the O
holes O
they O
were O
hiding O
in O
. O
'' O

The O
Philistines O
in O
the O
fort O
shouted O
to O
Jonathan O
and O
his O
helper O
, O
`` O
Come O
up O
here O
. O

We O
'll O
teach O
you O
a O
lesson O

'' O

Jonathan O
said O
to O
his O
helper O
, O
`` O
Follow O
me O
up O
the O
hill O
. O

The O
Lord O
is O
letting O
Israel O
defeat O
the O
Philistines O
. O
'' O

So O
Jonathan O
climbed O
up O
the O
hill O
with O
his O
hands O
and O
feet O
, O
and O
his O
helper O
was O
right O
behind O
him O
. O

Jonathan O
and O
his O
helper O
attacked O
them O
. O

In O
the O
first O
attack O
, O
they O
killed O
20 O
Philistines O
in O
an O
area O
about O
one-half O
acre O
in O
size O
. O

Jonathan O
fought O
the O
men O
who O
attacked O
from O
the O
front O
. O

His O
helper O
came O
behind O
him O
and O
killed O
the O
men O
who O
were O
only O
wounded O
. O

Great O
fear O
spread O
among O
the O
Philistine O
soldiers O
-- O
those O
in O
the O
field O
, O
in O
the O
camp O
, O
and O
at O
the O
fort O
. O

Even O
the O
bravest O
soldiers O
were O
afraid O
. O

The O
ground O
began O
to O
shake O
, O
and O
they O
were O
completely O
overcome O
with O
fear O
. O

Saul O
's O
guards O
at O
Gibeah O
in O
the O
land O
of O
Benjamin O
saw O
the O
Philistine O
soldiers O
running O
away O
in O
different O
ways O
. O

Saul O
said O
to O
the O
army O
with O
him O
, O
`` O
Count O
the O
men O

I O
want O
to O
know O
who O
left O
camp O
. O
'' O

They O
counted O
the O
men O
. O

Jonathan O
and O
his O
helper O
were O
gone O
. O

Saul O
said O
to O
Ahijah O
, O
`` O
Bring O
God O
's O
Holy O
Box O
! O
'' O

-LRB- O
At O
that O
time O
God O
's O
Holy O
Box O
was O
there O
with O
the O
Israelites O
. O
-RRB- O

Saul O
was O
talking O
to O
Ahijah O
the O
priest O
waiting O
for O
advice O
from O
God O
. O

But O
the O
noise O
and O
confusion O
in O
the O
Philistine O
camp O
was O
growing O
and O
growing O
. O

Saul O
was O
becoming O
impatient O
. O

Finally O
, O
he O
said O
to O
Ahijah O
the O
priest O
, O
`` O
That O
's O
enough O
. O

Put O
your O
hand O
down O
and O
stop O
praying O
. O
'' O

Saul O
gathered O
his O
army O
together O
and O
went O
to O
the O
battle O
. O

The O
Philistine O
soldiers O
were O
very O
confused O
. O

They O
were O
even O
fighting O
each O
other O
with O
their O
swords O
. O

There O
were O
Hebrews O
who O
served O
the O
Philistines O
in O
the O
past O
and O
who O
stayed O
in O
the O
Philistine O
camp O
. O

But O
now O
these O
Hebrews O
joined O
the O
Israelites O
with O
Saul O
and O
Jonathan O
. O

All O
the O
Israelites O
who O
had O
hidden O
in O
the O
hill O
country O
of O
Ephraim O
heard O
the O
Philistine O
soldiers O
were O
running O
away O
. O

So O
these O
Israelites O
also O
joined O
in O
the O
battle O
and O
began O
chasing O
the O
Philistines O
. O

So O
the O
Lord O
saved O
the O
Israelites O
that O
day O
. O

The O
battle O
moved O
on O
past O
Beth O
Aven O
. O

The O
whole O
army O
was O
with O
Saul O
-- O
he O
now O
had O
about O
10,000 O
men O
. O

The O
battle O
spread O
to O
every O
city O
in O
the O
hill O
country O
of O
Ephraim O
. O

But O
Saul O
made O
a O
big O
mistake O
that O
day O
. O

He O
made O
this O
oath O
: O
`` O
If O
any O
man O
eats O
food O
before O
evening O
comes O
, O
before O
I O
finish O
defeating O
my O
enemies O
, O
he O
will O
be O
under O
a O
curse O
. O
'' O

He O
made O
the O
soldiers O
promise O
not O
to O
eat O
. O

So O
none O
of O
them O
ate O
anything O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
fighting O
, O
the O
people O
went O
into O
some O
woods O
. O

Then O
they O
saw O
a O
honeycomb O
on O
the O
ground O
. O

The O
Israelites O
went O
up O
to O
the O
honeycomb O
, O
but O
they O
did O
n't O
eat O
any O
of O
it O
. O

They O
were O
afraid O
to O
break O
the O
promise O
. O

But O
Jonathan O
did O
n't O
know O
about O
the O
oath O
. O

He O
did O
n't O
hear O
his O
father O
make O
the O
soldiers O
promise O
not O
to O
eat O
. O

Jonathan O
had O
a O
stick O
in O
his O
hand O
, O
so O
he O
dipped O
the O
end O
of O
the O
stick O
into O
the O
honeycomb O
and O
pulled O
out O
some O
honey O
. O

He O
ate O
the O
honey O
and O
began O
to O
feel O
much O
better O
. O

One O
of O
the O
soldiers O
told O
Jonathan O
, O
`` O
Your O
father O
forced O
the O
soldiers O
to O
make O
a O
special O
promise O
. O

He O
said O
that O
any O
man O
who O
eats O
today O
will O
be O
under O
a O
curse O
. O

So O
the O
men O
have O
not O
eaten O
anything O
. O

That O
's O
why O
they O
are O
weak O
. O
'' O

Jonathan O
said O
, O
`` O
My O
father O
has O
brought O
a O
lot O
of O
trouble O
to O
the O
land O
. O

See O
how O
much O
better O
I O
feel O
after O
tasting O
just O
a O
little O
of O
this O
honey O
. O

It O
would O
have O
been O
much O
better O
for O
the O
men O
to O
eat O
the O
food O
that O
they O
took O
from O
their O
enemies O
today O
. O

We O
could O
have O
killed O
more O
Philistines O
. O
'' O

That O
day O
the O
Israelites O
defeated O
the O
Philistines O
. O

They O
fought O
them O
all O
the O
way O
from O
Micmash O
to O
Aijalon O
. O

So O
the O
people O
were O
very O
tired O
and O
hungry O
. O

They O
had O
taken O
sheep O
, O
cattle O
, O
and O
calves O
from O
the O
Philistines O
. O

Now O
they O
were O
so O
hungry O
that O
they O
killed O
the O
animals O
on O
the O
ground O
and O
ate O
them O
. O

And O
the O
blood O
was O
still O
in O
the O
animals O
. O

Someone O
said O
to O
Saul O
, O
`` O
Look O
, O
the O
men O
are O
sinning O
against O
the O
Lord O
. O

They O
're O
eating O
meat O
that O
still O
has O
blood O
in O
it O
! O
'' O

Saul O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
have O
sinned O
. O

Roll O
a O
large O
stone O
over O
here O
now O
! O
'' O

Then O
Saul O
said O
, O
`` O
Go O
to O
the O
men O
and O
tell O
them O
that O
each O
one O
must O
bring O
his O
bull O
and O
sheep O
to O
me O
. O

Then O
the O
men O
must O
kill O
their O
bulls O
and O
sheep O
here O
. O

Do O
n't O
sin O
against O
the O
Lord O
! O

Do O
n't O
eat O
meat O
that O
still O
has O
blood O
in O
it O
. O
'' O

That O
night O
everyone O
brought O
their O
animals O
and O
killed O
them O
there O
. O

Then O
Saul O
built O
an O
altar O
for O
the O
Lord O
. O

Saul O
himself O
began O
building O
that O
altar O
for O
the O
Lord O
. O

Saul O
said O
, O
`` O
Let O
's O
go O
after O
the O
Philistines O
tonight O
. O

We O
will O
take O
everything O
from O
them O
. O

We O
will O
kill O
them O
all O
! O
'' O

The O
army O
answered O
, O
`` O
Do O
whatever O
you O
think O
is O
best O
. O
'' O

But O
the O
priest O
said O
, O
`` O
Let O
's O
ask O
God O
. O
'' O

So O
Saul O
asked O
God O
, O
`` O
Should O
I O
go O
chase O
the O
Philistines O
? O

Will O
you O
let O
us O
defeat O
the O
Philistines O
? O
'' O

But O
God O
did O
not O
answer O
Saul O
that O
day O
. O

So O
Saul O
said O
, O
`` O
Bring O
all O
the O
leaders O
to O
me O
! O

Let O
's O
find O
who O
committed O
the O
sin O
today O

I O
swear O
by O
the O
Lord O
who O
saves O
Israel O
, O
that O
even O
if O
my O
own O
son O
Jonathan O
sinned O
, O
he O
must O
die O
. O
'' O

None O
of O
the O
people O
said O
a O
word O
. O

Then O
Saul O
said O
to O
all O
the O
Israelites O
, O
`` O
You O
stand O
on O
this O
side O

I O
and O
my O
son O

stand O
on O

side O

'' O

The O
soldiers O
answered O
, O
`` O
As O
you O
wish O
, O
sir O
. O
'' O

Then O
Saul O
prayed O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
God O
of O
Israel O
, O
why O
have O
n't O
you O
answered O

Urim O

If O

Thummim O

'' O

Saul O
and O
Jonathan O
were O
chosen O
, O
and O
the O
people O
went O
free O
. O

Saul O
said O
, O
`` O
Throw O

again O

show O
who O

me O

son O

Jonathan O
was O
chosen O

Saul O
said O
to O
Jonathan O
, O
`` O
Tell O
me O
what O
you O

done O

Jonathan O
told O
Saul O
, O
`` O
I O
only O

a O
little O
honey O

end O

Should O

for O
doing O
that O
? O

Saul O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
made O
an O
oath O

asked O

Jonathan O

But O
the O
soldiers O
said O
to O
Saul O
, O
`` O
Jonathan O

a O
great O
victory O

God O

So O
the O
people O
saved O
Jonathan O

He O
was O
not O
put O
to O
death O
. O

Saul O
did O
not O
chase O
the O
Philistines O
. O

The O
Philistines O
went O
back O
to O
their O
place O

Saul O
took O
full O
control O
of O
Israel O
and O
fought O
all O
the O
enemies O
who O
lived O
around O
Israel O

Saul O
fought O
Moab O

the O
Ammonites O
, O
Edom O

the O
king O
of O
Zobah O
, O
and O
the O
Philistines O

tried O
to O
take O
things O
from O

He O
even O
defeated O

Saul O

Ahinoam O

the O

The O
commander O
of O
Saul O

Abner O

Any O
time O
Saul O
saw O
a O
man O

he O
took O
that O
man O

put O
him O
into O
the O
group O

soldiers O

stayed O
near O
the O
king O

Hannah O

Do O

Do O
n't O

bows O

the O
woman O

Elkanah O
and O
his O
family O
went O
home O
to O
Ramah O
, O
but O
the O
boy O
stayed O
in O
Shiloh O
and O
served O
the O
Lord O
under O
Eli O
the O
priest O
. O

Eli O
's O
sons O
were O
evil O
men O
who O
did O
not O
care O
about O
the O
Lord O
. O

They O
did O
not O
care O
about O
how O
priests O
were O
supposed O
to O
treat O
people O
. O

Whenever O
someone O
brings O
a O
sacrifice O
, O
priests O
are O
supposed O
to O
put O
the O
meat O
in O
a O
pot O
of O
boiling O
water O

Then O
their O
servant O
is O
supposed O
get O
the O
three-pronged O
fork O
and O
use O
it O
to O
get O
some O
meat O
out O
of O
the O
pot O
or O
kettle O

The O
priest O
is O
supposed O
to O
take O
whatever O
his O
helper O
removes O
from O
the O
pot O
with O
the O
special O
fork O
. O

This O
is O
what O
the O
priests O
should O
have O
done O
for O
the O
Israelites O
who O
came O
to O
offer O
sacrifices O
at O
Shiloh O
. O

But O
that O
is O
not O
what O
the O
sons O
of O
Eli O
did O
. O

Even O
before O
the O
fat O
was O
burned O
on O
the O
altar O
, O
their O
servant O
would O
go O
to O
the O
people O
offering O
sacrifices O
and O
say O
, O
`` O
Give O
the O
priest O
some O
meat O
to O
roast O

The O
priest O
wo O
n't O
accept O
boiled O
meat O
from O
you O

'' O

Maybe O
the O
man O
offering O
the O
sacrifice O
would O
say O
, O
`` O
Burn O
the O
fat O
first O
, O
and O
then O
you O
can O
take O
whatever O
you O
want O

'' O

But O
the O
servant O
would O
answer O
: O
`` O
No O
, O
give O
me O
the O
meat O
now O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
give O
it O
to O
me O
, O
I O
'll O
take O
it O
from O
you O
! O
'' O

In O
this O
way O
Hophni O
and O
Phinehas O
showed O
that O
they O
did O
not O
respect O
the O
offerings O
made O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

This O
was O
a O
terrible O
sin O
against O
the O
Lord O
. O

But O
Samuel O
served O
the O
Lord O
. O

He O
was O
a O
helper O
who O
wore O
the O
linen O
ephod O
. O

Every O
year O
Samuel O
's O
mother O
made O
a O
robe O
for O
Samuel O

She O
took O
the O
little O
robe O
to O
Samuel O
when O
she O
went O
up O
to O
Shiloh O
with O
her O
husband O
for O
the O
sacrifice O
every O
year O

Eli O
would O
bless O
Elkanah O
and O
his O
wife O

He O
would O
say O
, O
`` O
May O
the O
Lord O
give O
you O
more O
children O

Hannah O

and O
she O
had O
three O
sons O
and O
two O
daughters O
. O

The O
boy O
Samuel O
grew O
up O
at O
the O
holy O
place O
near O
the O
Lord O
. O

Eli O
was O
very O
old O
. O

He O
heard O
about O
the O
bad O
things O
his O
sons O
were O
doing O
to O
the O
Israelites O
at O
Shiloh O
and O
how O
his O
sons O
were O
having O
sexual O
relations O
with O
the O
women O
who O
served O
at O
the O
door O
of O
the O
Meeting O
Tent O
. O

Eli O
said O
to O
his O
sons O
, O
`` O
The O
people O
here O
told O
me O
about O
the O
evil O
things O
you O
have O
done O
. O

Why O
are O
you O
doing O
such O
things O
? O

Sons O
, O
stop O
that O
! O

The O
Lord O
's O
people O
are O
saying O
bad O
things O
about O
you O
. O

If O
you O
sin O
against O
other O
people O
, O
God O
might O
protect O
you O
. O

But O
who O
can O
help O
you O
if O
you O
sin O
against O
the O
Lord O
? O
'' O

Eli O
's O
sons O
refused O
to O
listen O
to O
him O
, O
so O
the O
Lord O
decided O
to O
kill O
them O
. O

The O
boy O
Samuel O
kept O
growing O
. O

He O
was O
pleasing O
to O
God O
and O
to O
the O
people O
. O

A O
man O
of O
God O
came O
to O
Eli O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
Lord O
says O
, O
' O
I O
appeared O
to O
your O
ancestors O
when O
they O
were O
slaves O
of O
Pharaoh O
. O

From O
all O
the O
tribes O
of O
Israel O
, O
I O
chose O
your O
tribe O
to O
be O
my O
priests O
. O

I O
chose O
them O
to O
offer O
sacrifices O
on O
my O
altar O
, O
to O
burn O
incense O
, O
and O
wear O
the O
ephod O
. O

I O
also O
let O
your O
tribe O
have O
the O
meat O
from O
the O
sacrifices O
that O
the O
Israelites O
give O
to O
me O
. O

So O
why O
do O
n't O
you O
respect O
these O
gifts O
and O
sacrifices O
? O

You O
honor O
your O
sons O
more O
than O
me O
. O

You O
become O
fat O
eating O
the O
best O
parts O
of O
the O
meat O
that O
the O
Israelites O
bring O
to O
me O
. O
' O

`` O
The O
Lord O
, O
the O
God O
of O
Israel O
, O
promised O
that O
your O
father O
's O
family O
would O
serve O
him O
forever O
. O

But O
now O
the O
Lord O
says O
, O
' O
That O
will O
never O
be O
! O

I O
will O
honor O
people O
who O
honor O
me O
, O
but O
bad O
things O
will O
happen O
to O
those O
who O
refuse O
to O
respect O
me O
. O

The O
time O
is O
coming O
when O
I O
will O
destroy O
all O
your O
descendants O
. O

No O
one O
in O
your O
family O
will O
live O
to O
be O
an O
old O
man O

Good O
things O
will O
happen O
to O
Israel O
, O
but O
you O
will O
see O
bad O
things O
happening O
at O
home O
. O

No O
one O
in O
your O
family O
will O
live O
to O
be O
an O
old O
man O

There O
is O
only O
one O
man O
I O
will O
save O
to O
serve O
as O
priest O
at O
my O
altar O
. O

He O
will O
live O
until O
his O
eyes O
wear O
out O
and O
his O
strength O
is O
gone O
. O

But O
all O
of O
your O
descendants O
will O
die O
by O
the O
sword O
. O

I O
will O
give O
you O
a O
sign O
to O
show O
that O
these O
things O
will O
come O
true O
. O

Your O
two O
sons O
, O
Hophni O
and O
Phinehas O
, O
will O
die O
on O
the O
same O
day O
. O

I O
will O
choose O
a O
priest O
I O
can O
trust O
. O

This O
priest O
will O
listen O
to O
me O
and O
do O
what O
I O
want O
. O

I O
will O
make O
his O
family O
strong O
, O
and O
he O
will O
always O
serve O
before O
my O
chosen O
king O
. O

Then O
whoever O
is O
left O
in O
your O
family O
will O
come O
and O
bow O
down O
before O
this O
priest O
and O
beg O
for O
a O
little O
money O
or O
a O
piece O
of O
bread O
. O

They O
will O
say O
, O
`` O
Please O
give O
me O
a O
job O
as O
priest O
so O
that O
I O
can O
have O
some O
food O

. O
' O
' O
' O
'' O

Then O
David O
left O
and O
Jonathan O
went O
back O
to O
the O
town O
. O

David O
went O
to O
the O
town O
named O
Nob O
to O
see O
Ahimelech O
the O
priest O
. O

Ahimelech O
went O
out O
to O
meet O
David O
. O

He O
was O
afraid O
of O
David O
and O
asked O
, O
`` O
Why O
are O
you O
alone O
? O

Why O
is O
n't O
anyone O
with O
you O
? O
'' O

David O
answered O
him O
, O
`` O
The O
king O
gave O
me O
a O
special O
order O
. O

He O
told O
me O
, O
' O
Do O
n't O
let O
anyone O
know O
about O
this O
mission O
. O

No O
one O
must O
know O
what O
I O
told O
you O
to O
do O
. O
' O

I O
told O
my O
men O
where O
to O
meet O
me O
. O

Now O
, O
what O
food O
do O
you O
have O
with O
you O
? O

Give O
me O
five O
loaves O
of O
bread O
or O
whatever O
you O
have O
to O
eat O
. O
'' O

The O
priest O
said O
to O
David O
, O
`` O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
any O
ordinary O
bread O
here O
, O
but O
I O
do O
have O
some O
of O
the O
holy O
bread O
. O

Your O
officers O
can O
eat O
it O
if O
they O
have O
not O
had O
sexual O
relations O
with O
any O
women O
. O
'' O

David O
answered O
the O
priest O
, O
`` O
We O
have O
not O
been O
with O
any O
women O
. O

My O
men O
keep O
their O
bodies O
holy O
every O
time O
we O
go O
out O
to O
fight O
, O
even O
on O
ordinary O
missions O
. O

And O
this O
is O
especially O
true O
today O
. O
'' O

There O
was O
no O
bread O
except O
the O
holy O
bread O
, O
so O
the O
priest O
gave O
David O
this O
bread O
. O

This O
was O
the O
bread O
that O
the O
priests O
put O
on O
the O
holy O
table O
before O
the O
Lord O
. O

Each O
day O
they O
took O
this O
bread O
away O
and O
put O
fresh O
bread O
in O
its O
place O
. O

One O
of O
Saul O
's O
officers O
was O
there O
that O
day O
. O

He O
was O
Doeg O
the O
Edomite O
, O
the O
leader O
of O
Saul O
's O
shepherds O
. O

He O
had O
been O
kept O
there O
before O
the O
Lord O
. O

David O
asked O
Ahimelech O
, O
`` O
Do O
you O
have O
a O
spear O
or O
sword O
here O
? O

The O
king O
's O
business O
is O
very O
important O
. O

I O
had O
to O
leave O
quickly O
, O
and O
I O
did O
n't O
bring O
my O
sword O
or O
any O
other O
weapon O
. O
'' O

The O
priest O
answered O
, O
`` O
The O
only O
sword O
here O
is O
the O
sword O
of O
Goliath O
the O
Philistine O
. O

It O
is O
the O
sword O
you O
took O
from O
him O
when O
you O
killed O
him O
in O
the O
Valley O
of O
Elah O
. O

That O
sword O
is O
behind O
the O
ephod O
, O
wrapped O
in O
a O
cloth O
. O

You O
may O
take O
it O
if O
you O
want O
to O
. O
'' O

David O
said O
, O
`` O
Goliath O
's O
sword O
-- O
there O
's O
not O
another O
one O
like O
it O
. O

Give O
it O
to O
me O
. O
'' O

That O
day O
David O
ran O
away O
from O
Saul O
and O
went O
to O
King O
Achish O
of O
Gath O
. O

Achish O
's O
officers O
said O
, O
`` O
Is O
n't O
this O
David O
, O
the O
king O
of O
the O
land O
of O
Israel O
? O

He O
is O
the O
one O
the O
Israelites O
sing O
about O
. O

They O
dance O
and O
sing O
this O
song O
about O
him O
: O
`` O
Saul O
has O
killed O
thousands O
of O
enemies O
, O
but O
David O
has O
killed O
tens O
of O
thousands O
. O
'' O

David O
paid O
close O
attention O
to O
what O
they O
said O
. O

He O
was O
afraid O
of O
King O
Achish O
of O
Gath O
, O
so O
he O
pretended O
to O
be O
crazy O
in O
front O
of O
Achish O
and O
his O
officers O
. O

While O
David O
was O
with O
them O
, O
he O
acted O
like O
a O
crazy O
man O
. O

He O
spat O
on O
the O
doors O
of O
the O
gate O
. O

He O
let O
spit O
fall O
down O
his O
beard O
. O

Achish O
said O
to O
his O
officers O
, O
`` O
Look O
at O
the O
man O
! O

He O
is O
crazy O
. O

Why O
did O
you O
bring O
him O
to O
me O
? O

I O
have O
enough O
crazy O
men O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
need O
you O
to O
bring O
this O
man O
to O
my O
house O
to O
act O
crazy O
in O
front O
of O
me O
. O

Do O
n't O
let O
this O
man O
come O
into O
my O
house O
again O
. O
'' O

But O
David O
thought O
to O
himself O
, O
`` O
Saul O
will O
catch O
me O
some O
day O
. O

The O
best O
thing O
I O
can O
do O
is O
to O
escape O
to O
the O
land O
of O
the O
Philistines O
. O

Then O
Saul O
will O
give O
up O
looking O
for O
me O
in O
Israel O
. O

That O
way O
I O
will O
escape O
from O
Saul O
. O
'' O

So O
David O
and O
his O
600 O
men O
left O
Israel O
and O
went O
to O
Achish O
son O
of O
Maoch O
. O

Achish O
was O
king O
of O
Gath O
. O

David O
, O
his O
men O
, O
and O
their O
families O
lived O
in O
Gath O
with O
Achish O
. O

David O
had O
his O
two O
wives O
with O
him O
-- O
Ahinoam O
of O
Jezreel O
and O
Abigail O
of O
Carmel O
. O

Abigail O
was O
the O
widow O
of O
Nabal O
. O

People O
told O
Saul O
that O
David O
had O
run O
away O
to O
Gath O
, O
so O
Saul O
stopped O
looking O
for O
him O
. O

David O
said O
to O
Achish O
, O
`` O
If O
you O
are O
pleased O
with O
me O
, O
give O
me O
a O
place O
in O
one O
of O
the O
country O
towns O
. O

I O
am O
only O
your O
servant O
. O

I O
should O
live O
there O
, O
not O
here O
with O
you O
in O
this O
royal O
city O
. O
'' O

That O
day O
Achish O
gave O
David O
the O
town O
of O
Ziklag O
. O

And O
Ziklag O
has O
belonged O
to O
the O
kings O
of O
Judah O
ever O
since O
. O

David O
lived O
with O
the O
Philistines O
one O
year O
and O
four O
months O
. O

David O
and O
his O
men O
went O
to O
fight O
the O
Amalekites O
and O
Geshurites O
who O
lived O
in O
the O
area O
from O
Telem O
near O
Shur O
all O
the O
way O
to O
Egypt O
. O

David O
's O
men O
defeated O
them O
and O
took O
their O
wealth O
. O

David O
defeated O
the O
people O
in O
that O
area O
. O

He O
took O
all O
their O
sheep O
, O
cattle O
, O
donkeys O
, O
camels O
, O
and O
clothes O
and O
brought O
them O
back O
to O
Achish O
. O

But O
David O
did O
n't O
let O
any O
of O
those O
people O
live O
. O

David O
did O
this O
many O
times O
. O

Each O
time O
Achish O
asked O
David O
where O
he O
fought O
and O
took O
those O
things O
. O

David O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
fought O
against O
the O
southern O
part O
of O
Judah O
, O
'' O
or O
`` O
I O
fought O
against O
the O
southern O
part O
of O
Jerahmeel O
, O
'' O
or O
`` O
I O
fought O
against O
the O
southern O
part O
of O
the O
Kenizzites O
. O
'' O

David O
never O
brought O
a O
man O
or O
woman O
alive O
to O
Gath O
. O

He O
thought O
, O
`` O
If O
we O
let O
anyone O
live O
, O
they O
might O
tell O
Achish O
what O
I O
really O
did O
. O
'' O

David O
did O
this O
all O
the O
time O
he O
lived O
in O
the O
Philistine O
land O
. O

Achish O
began O
to O
trust O
David O
and O
said O
to O
himself O
, O
`` O
Now O
David O
's O
own O
people O
hate O
him O
. O

The O
Israelites O
hate O
him O
very O
much O
. O

Now O
he O
will O
serve O
me O
forever O
. O
'' O

The O
Philistines O
kept O
the O
Holy O
Box O
in O
their O
land O
for O
seven O
months O
. O

The O
Philistines O
called O
their O
priests O
and O
magicians O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
What O
must O
we O
do O
with O
the O
Lord O
's O
Box O
? O

Tell O
us O
how O
to O
send O
the O
Box O
back O
home O
. O
'' O

The O
priests O
and O
magicians O
answered O
, O
`` O
If O
you O
send O
back O
the O
Holy O
Box O
of O
the O
God O
of O
Israel O
, O
do O
n't O
send O
it O
away O
empty O
. O

You O
must O
offer O
gifts O
to O
the O
God O
of O
Israel O
. O

Then O
you O
will O
be O
healed O
. O

You O
must O
do O
this O
so O
that O
God O
will O
stop O
punishing O
you O
. O
'' O

The O
Philistines O
asked O
, O
`` O
What O
kind O
of O
gifts O
should O
we O
send O
for O
Israel O
's O
God O
to O
forgive O
us O
? O
'' O

The O
priests O
and O
magicians O
answered O
, O
`` O
There O
are O
five O
Philistine O
leaders O
, O
one O
leader O
for O
each O
city O
. O

All O
of O
you O
and O
your O
leaders O
had O
the O
same O
problems O
. O

So O
you O
must O
make O
five O
gold O
models O
to O
look O
like O
five O
tumors O
. O

And O
you O
must O
make O
five O
gold O
models O
to O
look O
like O
five O
mice O
. O

So O
make O
models O
of O
the O
tumors O
and O
models O
of O
the O
mice O
that O
are O
ruining O
the O
country O
. O

Give O
these O
gold O
models O
to O
the O
God O
of O
Israel O
as O
payment O
. O

Then O
maybe O
the O
God O
of O
Israel O
will O
stop O
punishing O
you O
, O
your O
gods O
, O
and O
your O
land O
. O

Do O
n't O
be O
stubborn O
like O
Pharaoh O
and O
the O
Egyptians O
. O

God O
punished O
the O
Egyptians O
. O

That O
is O
why O
the O
Egyptians O
let O
the O
Israelites O
leave O
Egypt O
. O

`` O
You O
must O
build O
a O
new O
wagon O
and O
get O
two O
cows O
that O
just O
had O
calves O
. O

These O
must O
be O
cows O
that O
have O
never O
worked O
in O
the O
fields O
. O

Tie O
the O
cows O
to O
the O
wagon O
so O
that O
they O
can O
pull O
it O
. O

Then O
take O
the O
calves O
back O
home O
and O
put O
them O
in O
their O
pen O
. O

Do O
n't O
let O
them O
follow O
their O
mothers O

Put O
the O
Lord O

Holy O
Box O
on O
the O
wagon O

You O
must O
put O
the O
golden O
models O
in O
the O
bag O
beside O
the O
Box O
. O

They O
are O
your O
gifts O
for O
God O
to O
forgive O
your O
sins O

Send O
the O
wagon O
straight O
on O
its O
way O

Watch O
the O
wagon O

If O
the O
wagon O
goes O
toward O
Beth O
Shemesh O
in O
Israel O

own O
land O

the O
Lord O
has O
given O
us O
this O
great O
sickness O

But O
if O
the O
cows O
do O
n't O
go O
straight O
to O
Beth O
Shemesh O
, O
we O
will O
know O
it O
was O
not O
their O
God O
who O
brought O
this O
sickness O
to O
us O
. O

It O
was O
just O
one O
of O
those O
things O
that O
sometimes O
happen O

'' O

The O
Philistines O
did O
what O
the O

said O

They O
found O
two O

put O
the O
calves O
in O
their O
pens O
at O
home O
. O

Then O
the O
Philistines O
put O
the O
Lord O
's O
Holy O
Box O
on O
the O
wagon O
along O
with O
the O
bag O
with O
the O
golden O
models O
of O
the O
tumors O
and O
mice O
. O

The O
cows O
went O
straight O
to O
Beth O
Shemesh O
. O

The O
cows O
stayed O
on O
the O
road O
, O
mooing O
all O
the O
way O
. O

They O
did O
not O
turn O
right O
or O
left O
. O

The O
Philistine O
rulers O
followed O
the O
cows O
as O
far O
as O
the O
city O
limits O
of O
Beth O
Shemesh O
. O

The O
people O
of O
Beth O
Shemesh O
were O
harvesting O
their O
wheat O
in O
the O
valley O
. O

They O
looked O
up O
and O
saw O
the O
Holy O
Box O
. O

They O
were O
very O
happy O
to O
see O
it O
again O
. O

They O
ran O
to O
get O
it O
. O

The O
wagon O
came O
to O
the O
field O
that O
belonged O
to O
Joshua O
of O
Beth O
Shemesh O
and O
stopped O
there O
near O
a O
large O
rock O
. O

Some O
Levites O
took O
down O
the O
Lord O
's O
Holy O
Box O
and O
the O
bag O
that O
had O
the O
golden O
models O
. O

The O
Levites O
put O
the O
Lord O
's O
Box O
and O
the O
bag O
that O
was O
with O
it O
on O
the O
large O
rock O
. O

The O
people O
of O
Beth O
Shemesh O
cut O
up O
the O
wagon O
and O
killed O
the O
cows O
. O

That O
day O
, O
they O
sacrificed O
the O
cows O
as O
burnt O
offerings O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

The O
five O
Philistine O
rulers O
watched O
the O
people O
of O
Beth O
Shemesh O
do O
this O
and O
then O
went O
back O
to O
Ekron O
that O
same O
day O
. O

In O
this O
way O
the O
Philistines O
sent O
golden O
models O
of O
tumors O
as O
gifts O
for O
their O
sins O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

They O
sent O
one O
golden O
model O
of O
a O
tumor O
for O
each O
of O
the O
Philistine O
towns O
of O
Ashdod O
, O
Gaza O
, O
Ashkelon O
, O
Gath O
, O
and O
Ekron O
. O

The O
Philistines O
also O
sent O
golden O
models O
of O
mice O
. O

The O
number O
of O
these O
golden O
mice O
was O
the O
same O
number O
as O
the O
towns O
that O
belonged O
to O
the O
five O
Philistine O
rulers O
. O

These O
towns O
had O
walls O
around O
them O
, O
and O
each O
town O
had O
villages O
around O
it O
. O

The O
people O
of O
Beth O
Shemesh O
put O
the O
Lord O
's O
Holy O
Box O
on O
a O
rock O
. O

That O
rock O
is O
still O
in O
the O
field O
of O
Joshua O
from O
Beth O
Shemesh O
. O

But O
there O
were O
no O
priests O
there O
, O
and O
the O
men O
of O
Beth O
Shemesh O
looked O
at O
the O
Lord O
's O
Holy O
Box O
. O

So O
the O
Lord O
killed O
70 O
men O
from O
Beth O
Shemesh O
. O

The O
people O
of O
Beth O
Shemesh O
cried O
because O
the O
Lord O
punished O
them O
so O
severely O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Where O
is O
a O
priest O
who O
can O
care O
for O
the O
Holy O
Box O
? O

Where O
should O
the O
Box O
go O
from O
here O
? O
'' O

There O
was O
a O
priest O
at O
Kiriath O
Jearim O
. O

The O
people O
of O
Beth O
Shemesh O
sent O
messengers O
to O
the O
people O
of O
Kiriath O
Jearim O
. O

The O
messengers O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
Philistines O
have O
brought O
back O
the O
Lord O
's O
Holy O
Box O
. O

Come O
down O
and O
take O
it O
to O
your O
city O
. O
'' O

When O
Samuel O
was O
old O
, O
he O
appointed O
his O
sons O
to O
be O
judges O
for O
Israel O
. O

Samuel O
's O
first O
son O
was O
named O
Joel O
. O

His O
second O
son O
was O
named O
Abijah O
. O

Joel O
and O
Abijah O
were O
judges O
in O
Beersheba O
. O

But O
Samuel O
's O
sons O
did O
not O
live O
the O
same O
way O
he O
did O
. O

Joel O
and O
Abijah O
accepted O
bribes O
. O

They O
took O
money O
secretly O
and O
changed O
their O
decisions O
in O
court O
. O

They O
cheated O
people O
in O
court O
. O

So O
all O
the O
elders O
of O
Israel O
met O
together O
and O
went O
to O
Ramah O
to O
meet O
with O
Samuel O
. O

The O
elders O
said O
to O
Samuel O
, O
`` O
You O
're O
old O
, O
and O
your O
sons O
do O
n't O
live O
right O
. O

They O
are O
not O
like O
you O
. O

Now O
, O
give O
us O
a O
king O
to O
rule O
us O
like O
all O
the O
other O
nations O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
elders O
asked O
for O
a O
king O
to O
lead O
them O
. O

Samuel O
thought O
this O
was O
a O
bad O
idea O
, O
so O
he O
prayed O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

The O
Lord O
told O
Samuel O
, O
`` O
Do O
what O
the O
people O
tell O
you O
. O

They O
have O
not O
rejected O
you O
. O

They O
have O
rejected O
me O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
want O
me O
to O
be O
their O
king O
. O

They O
are O
doing O
the O
same O
thing O
they O
have O
always O
done O
. O

I O
took O
them O
out O
of O
Egypt O
, O
but O
they O
left O
me O
and O
served O
other O
gods O
. O

They O
are O
doing O
the O
same O
to O
you O
. O

So O
listen O
to O
the O
people O
and O
do O
what O
they O
say O
. O

But O
give O
them O
a O
warning O
. O

Tell O
the O
people O
what O
a O
king O
will O
do O
to O
them O
. O

Tell O
them O
how O
a O
king O
rules O
people O
. O
'' O

Those O
people O
asked O
for O
a O
king O
. O

So O
Samuel O
told O
them O
everything O
the O
Lord O
said O
. O

Samuel O
said O
, O
`` O
If O
you O
have O
a O
king O

over O

this O
is O
what O
he O

He O
will O
take O
away O
your O
sons O
and O
force O
them O
to O

him O

He O
will O
force O
them O
to O
be O
soldiers O

they O
must O
fight O
from O
his O
chariots O
and O
become O
horse O

in O
his O
army O

Your O
sons O
will O
become O

running O
in O

of O
the O
king O

`` O
A O
king O
will O
force O
your O

He O
will O
choose O
which O
of O

sons O
will O
be O
officers O
over O
1000 O
men O
and O
which O
will O
be O
officers O
over O
50 O

`` O
A O

force O
some O
of O
your O

gather O
his O

He O
will O
force O
some O
of O
your O
sons O
to O
make O
weapons O
for O
war O
and O
to O
make O
things O
for O
his O
chariots O

`` O
A O

some O
of O
them O

him O
and O
some O
to O
cook O
and O

`` O
A O

He O

take O

He O

`` O
And O
you O
yourselves O

When O
that O
time O
comes O
, O
you O
will O
cry O
because O
of O
the O
king O
you O
chose O

But O
the O
Lord O
wo O
n't O
answer O
you O
at O
that O
time O

'' O

But O
the O
people O
would O
not O
listen O
to O
Samuel O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
No O
, O
we O
want O
a O
king O
to O
rule O
over O

Then O
we O
will O

Our O
king O
will O
lead O
us O

He O
will O
go O
before O
us O
and O
fight O
our O
battles O

'' O

Samuel O
listened O
to O
the O
people O
and O
then O
repeated O
their O
words O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

The O
Lord O
answered O
, O
`` O
Listen O
to O
them O
and O
give O
them O
a O
king O
. O
'' O

Then O
Samuel O
told O
the O
Israelites O
, O
`` O
You O
will O
have O
a O
king O
. O

Now O
go O
home O
. O
'' O

The O
boy O
Samuel O
was O
Eli O
's O
helper O
and O
served O
the O
Lord O
with O
him O
. O

At O
that O
time O
the O
Lord O
did O
not O
speak O
directly O
to O
people O
very O
often O
. O

There O
were O
very O
few O
visions O
. O

Eli O
's O
eyes O
were O
getting O
so O
weak O
that O
he O
was O
almost O
blind O
. O

One O
night O
he O
went O
to O
his O
room O
to O
go O
to O
bed O
. O

The O
special O
lamp O
in O
the O
temple O
was O
still O
burning O
, O
so O
Samuel O
lay O
down O
in O
the O
temple O
near O
where O
the O
Holy O
Box O
was O
. O

The O
Lord O
called O
Samuel O
, O
and O
Samuel O
answered O
, O
`` O
Here O
I O
am O
. O
'' O

Samuel O
thought O
Eli O
was O
calling O
him O
, O
so O
he O
ran O
to O
Eli O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Here O
I O
am O
. O

You O
called O
me O
. O
'' O

But O
Eli O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
did O
n't O
call O
you O
. O

Go O
back O
to O
bed O
. O
'' O

So O
Samuel O
went O
back O
to O
bed O
. O

Again O
the O
Lord O
called O
, O
`` O
Samuel O
! O
'' O

Again O
Samuel O
ran O
to O
Eli O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Here O
I O
am O
. O

You O
called O
me O
. O
'' O

Eli O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
did O
n't O
call O
you O
. O

Go O
back O
to O
bed O
. O
'' O

Samuel O
did O
not O
yet O
know O
the O
Lord O
because O
the O
Lord O
had O
not O
spoken O
directly O
to O
him O
before O
. O

The O
Lord O
called O
Samuel O
the O
third O
time O
. O

Again O
Samuel O
got O
up O
and O
went O
to O
Eli O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Here O
I O
am O
. O

You O
called O
me O
. O
'' O

Finally O
, O
Eli O
understood O
that O
the O
Lord O
was O
calling O
the O
boy O
. O

Eli O
told O
Samuel O
, O
`` O
Go O
to O
bed O
. O

If O
he O
calls O
you O
again O
, O
say O
, O
' O
Speak O
, O
Lord O
. O

I O
am O
your O
servant O
, O
and O
I O
am O
listening O
. O
' O
'' O

So O
Samuel O
went O
back O
to O
bed O
. O

The O
Lord O
came O
and O
stood O
there O
. O

He O
called O
as O
he O
did O
before O
, O
saying O
, O
`` O
Samuel O
, O
Samuel O
! O
'' O

Samuel O
said O
, O
`` O
Speak O
. O

I O
am O
your O
servant O
, O
and O
I O
am O
listening O
. O
'' O

The O
Lord O
said O
to O
Samuel O
, O
`` O
I O
will O
soon O
do O
things O
in O
Israel O
that O
will O
shock O
anyone O
who O
hears O
about O
them O
. O

I O
will O
do O
everything O
I O
said O
I O
would O
do O
against O
Eli O
and O
his O
family O
, O
everything O
from O
the O
beginning O
to O
the O
end O
. O

I O
told O
Eli O
I O
would O
punish O
his O
family O
forever O
. O

I O
will O
do O
this O
because O
Eli O
knew O
his O
sons O
were O
saying O
and O
doing O
bad O
things O
against O
God O
. O

But O
he O
failed O
to O
control O
them O
. O

That O
is O
why O
I O
swore O
an O
oath O
that O
sacrifices O
and O
offerings O
will O
never O
take O
away O
the O
sins O
of O
the O
people O
in O
Eli O
's O
family O
. O
'' O

Samuel O
lay O
down O
in O
bed O
until O
the O
morning O
came O
. O

He O
got O
up O
early O
and O
opened O
the O
doors O
of O
the O
Lord O
's O
house O
. O

Samuel O
was O
afraid O
to O
tell O
Eli O
about O
the O
vision O
. O

But O
Eli O
said O
to O
Samuel O
, O
`` O
Samuel O
, O
my O
son O
. O
'' O

Samuel O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
sir O
. O
'' O

Eli O
asked O
, O
`` O
What O
did O
the O
Lord O
say O
to O
you O
? O

Do O
n't O
hide O
it O
from O
me O
. O

God O
will O
punish O
you O
if O
you O
hide O
anything O
from O
the O
message O
he O
spoke O
to O
you O
. O
'' O

So O
Samuel O
told O
Eli O
everything O
. O

He O
did O
not O
hide O
anything O
from O
Eli O
. O

Eli O
said O
, O
`` O
He O
is O
the O
Lord O
. O

Let O
him O
do O
whatever O
he O
thinks O
is O
right O
. O
'' O

The O
Lord O
was O
with O
Samuel O
while O
he O
grew O
up O
. O

He O
did O
not O
let O
any O
of O
Samuel O
's O
messages O
prove O
false O
. O

Then O
all O
Israel O
, O
from O
Dan O
to O
Beersheba O
, O
knew O
that O
Samuel O
was O
a O
true O
prophet O
of O
the O
Lord O
. O

And O
the O
Lord O
continued O
to O
appear O
to O
Samuel O
at O
Shiloh O
. O

He O
revealed O
himself O
to O
Samuel O
as O
the O
word O
of O
the O
Lord O
. O

News O
about O
Samuel O
spread O
throughout O
Israel O
. O

Eli O
was O
very O
old O
. O

His O
sons O
kept O
doing O
bad O
things O
before O
the O
Lord O
. O

At O
that O
time O
the O
Israelites O
went O
out O
to O
fight O
against O
the O
Philistines O
. O

The O
Israelites O
made O
their O
camp O
at O
Ebenezer O
. O

The O
Philistines O
made O
their O
camp O
at O
Aphek O
. O

The O
Philistines O
lined O
up O
their O
soldiers O
in O
front O
of O
the O
Israelites O
and O
began O
the O
attack O
. O

The O
Philistines O
defeated O
the O
Israelites O
. O

They O
killed O
about O
4000 O
soldiers O
from O
Israel O
's O
army O
. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
Israelite O
soldiers O
went O
back O
to O
their O
camp O
. O

The O
elders O
of O
Israel O
asked O
, O
`` O
Why O
did O
the O
Lord O
let O
the O
Philistines O
defeat O
us O
? O

Let O
's O
bring O
the O
Lord O
's O
Box O
of O
the O
Agreement O
from O
Shiloh O
. O

God O
will O
go O
with O
us O
into O
battle O
and O
save O
us O
from O
our O
enemies O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
people O
sent O
men O
to O
Shiloh O
. O

The O
men O
brought O
back O
the O
Lord O
All-Powerful O
's O
Box O
of O
the O
Agreement O
. O

On O
top O
of O
the O
Box O
are O
the O
Cherub O
angels O
. O

They O
are O
like O
the O
throne O
that O
the O
Lord O
sits O
on O
. O

Eli O
's O
two O
sons O
, O
Hophni O
and O
Phinehas O
, O
came O
with O
the O
Box O
. O

When O
the O
Lord O
's O
Box O
of O
the O
Agreement O
came O
into O
the O
camp O
, O
all O
the O
Israelites O
gave O
a O
great O
shout O
loud O
enough O
to O
make O
the O
ground O
shake O
. O

The O
Philistines O
heard O
Israel O
's O
shout O
and O
asked O
, O
`` O
Why O
are O
the O
people O
so O
excited O
in O
the O
Hebrew O
camp O
? O
'' O

Then O
the O
Philistines O
learned O
that O
the O
Lord O
's O
Holy O
Box O
had O
been O
brought O
into O
Israel O
's O
camp O
. O

They O
became O
afraid O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Gods O
have O
come O
to O
their O
camp O
! O

We O
're O
in O
trouble O
. O

This O
has O
never O
happened O
before O
. O

We O
are O
worried O
. O

Who O
can O
save O
us O
from O
these O
powerful O
gods O
? O

These O
gods O
are O
the O
same O
ones O
that O
gave O
the O
Egyptians O
those O
diseases O
and O
terrible O
sicknesses O
. O

Be O
brave O
, O
Philistines O
. O

Fight O
like O
men O
. O

In O
the O
past O
they O
were O
our O
slaves O
, O
so O
fight O
like O
men O
or O
you O
will O
become O
their O
slaves O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
Philistines O
fought O
very O
hard O
and O
defeated O
the O
Israelites O
. O

The O
Israelite O
soldiers O
ran O
away O
and O
went O
home O
. O

It O
was O
a O
terrible O
defeat O
for O
Israel O
. O

30,000 O
Israelite O
soldiers O
were O
killed O
. O

The O
Philistines O
took O
God O
's O
Holy O
Box O
and O
killed O
Eli O
's O
two O
sons O
, O
Hophni O
and O
Phinehas O
. O

One O
of O
the O
men O
who O
ran O
from O
the O
battle O
was O
a O
man O
from O
the O
tribe O
of O
Benjamin O
. O

He O
tore O
his O
clothes O
and O
put O
dust O
on O
his O
head O
to O
show O
his O
great O
sadness O
. O

Eli O
was O
worried O
about O
the O
Holy O
Box O
, O
so O
he O
was O
sitting O
there O
by O
the O
city O
gate O
waiting O
and O
watching O
when O
the O
Benjamite O
man O
came O
into O
Shiloh O
and O
told O
the O
bad O
news O
. O

All O
the O
people O
in O
town O
began O
to O
cry O
loudly O
. O

Eli O
was O
98 O
years O
old O
. O

He O
was O
blind O
, O
so O
he O
could O
not O
see O
what O
was O
happening O
, O
but O
he O
could O
hear O
the O
loud O
noise O
of O
the O
people O
crying O
. O

Eli O
asked O
, O
`` O
Why O
are O
the O
people O
making O
this O
loud O
noise O
? O
'' O

The O
Benjamite O
man O
ran O
to O
Eli O
and O
told O
him O
what O
happened O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
the O
man O
who O
just O
came O
from O
the O
battle O
. O

I O
ran O
away O
from O
the O
battle O
today O
. O
'' O

Eli O
asked O
, O
`` O
What O
happened O
, O
son O
? O
'' O

The O
Benjamite O
man O
answered O
, O
`` O
Israel O
ran O
away O
from O
the O
Philistines O
. O

The O
Israelite O
army O
has O
lost O
many O
soldiers O
. O

Your O
two O
sons O
are O
both O
dead O
, O
and O
the O
Philistines O
took O
God O
's O
Holy O
Box O
. O
'' O

When O
the O
Benjamite O
man O
mentioned O
God O
's O
Holy O
Box O
, O
Eli O
fell O
backward O
off O
his O
chair O
near O
the O
gate O
and O
broke O
his O
neck O
. O

Eli O
was O
old O
and O
fat O
, O
so O
he O
died O
. O

He O
had O
led O
Israel O
for O
20 O
years O
. O

Eli O
's O
daughter-in-law O
, O
the O
wife O
of O
Phinehas O
, O
was O
pregnant O
. O

It O
was O
nearly O
time O
for O
her O
baby O
to O
be O
born O
. O

She O
heard O
the O
news O
that O
God O
's O
Holy O
Box O
was O
taken O
. O

She O
also O
heard O
that O
her O
father-in-law O
Eli O
and O
her O
husband O
Phinehas O
were O
both O
dead O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
she O
heard O
the O
news O
, O
her O
pain O
started O
and O
she O
began O
giving O
birth O
to O
her O
baby O
. O

She O
was O
about O
to O
die O
when O
the O
women O
who O
were O
helping O
her O
said O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
worry O
, O
you O
have O
given O
birth O
to O
a O
son O
. O
'' O

But O
she O
did O
not O
answer O
or O
pay O
attention O
. O

She O
named O
the O
baby O
Ichabod O
, O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
`` O
Israel O
's O
glory O
has O
been O
taken O
away O
. O
'' O

She O
did O
this O
because O
God O
's O
Holy O
Box O
was O
taken O
away O
and O
because O
both O
her O
father-in-law O
and O
her O
husband O
were O
dead O
. O

She O
said O
, O
`` O
Israel O
's O
glory O
has O
been O
taken O
away O
'' O
because O
the O
Philistines O
had O
taken O

him O
. O

Hiram O
was O
the O
king O
of O
Tyre O
. O

He O
had O
always O
been O
David O
's O
friend O
. O

So O
when O
Hiram O
heard O
that O
Solomon O
had O
become O
the O
new O
king O
after O
David O
, O
he O
sent O
his O
servants O
to O
Solomon O
. O

This O
is O
what O
Solomon O
said O
to O
King O
Hiram O
: O
`` O
You O
remember O
that O
my O
father O
, O
King O
David O
, O
had O
to O
fight O
many O
wars O
all O
around O
him O
. O

So O
he O
was O
never O
able O
to O
build O
a O
temple O
to O
honor O
the O
Lord O
his O
God O
. O

King O
David O
was O
waiting O
until O
the O
Lord O
allowed O
him O
to O
defeat O
all O
his O
enemies O
. O

But O
now O
the O
Lord O
my O
God O
has O
given O
me O
peace O
along O
all O
the O
borders O
of O
my O
country O
. O

I O
have O
no O
enemies O
, O
and O
my O
people O
are O
in O
no O
danger O
. O

`` O
The O
Lord O
made O
a O
promise O
to O
my O
father O
David O
. O

He O
said O
, O
' O
I O
will O
make O
your O
son O
king O
after O
you O
, O
and O
he O
will O
build O
a O
temple O
to O
honor O
me O
. O
' O

Now O
, O
I O
plan O
to O
build O
that O
temple O
to O
honor O
the O
Lord O
my O
God O
. O

And O
so O
I O
ask O
you O
to O
help O
me O
. O

Send O
your O
men O
to O
Lebanon O
to O
cut O
down O
cedar O
trees O
for O
me O
. O

My O
servants O
will O
work O
with O
yours O
. O

I O
will O
pay O
you O
any O
price O
that O
you O
decide O
as O
your O
servants O
' O
wages O
, O
but O
I O
need O
your O
help O
. O

Our O
carpenters O
are O
not O
as O
good O
as O
the O
carpenters O
of O
Sidon O
. O
'' O

Hiram O
was O
very O
happy O
when O
he O
heard O
what O
Solomon O
asked O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
praise O
the O
Lord O
today O
for O
giving O
David O
a O
wise O
son O
to O
rule O
this O
great O
nation O
! O
'' O

Then O
Hiram O
sent O
this O
message O
to O
Solomon O
, O
`` O
I O
heard O
what O
you O
asked O
for O
. O

I O
will O
give O
you O
all O
the O
cedar O
trees O
and O
the O
fir O
trees O
you O
want O
. O

My O
servants O
will O
bring O
them O
down O
from O
Lebanon O
to O
the O
sea O
. O

Then O
I O
will O
tie O
them O
together O
and O
float O
them O
down O
the O
shore O
to O
the O
place O
you O
choose O
. O

There O
I O
will O
separate O
the O
logs O
, O
and O
you O
can O
take O
them O
from O
there O
. O

As O
payment O
for O
this O
, O
you O
will O
give O
food O
to O
all O
those O
who O
live O
in O
my O
palace O
. O
'' O

So O
Hiram O
gave O
Solomon O
all O
the O
cedar O
and O
fir O
logs O
that O
he O
wanted O
. O

Solomon O
gave O
Hiram O
about O
120,000 O
bushels O
of O
wheat O
and O
about O
120,000 O
gallons O
of O
pure O
olive O
oil O
every O
year O
for O
his O
family O
. O

The O
Lord O
made O
Solomon O
wise O
as O
he O
had O
promised O
. O

Hiram O
and O
Solomon O
made O
a O
treaty O
between O
themselves O
and O
were O
at O
peace O
with O
one O
another O
. O

King O
Solomon O
forced O
30,000 O
men O
of O
Israel O
to O
help O
in O
this O
work O
. O

He O
chose O
a O
man O
named O
Adoniram O
to O
be O
in O
charge O
of O
them O
. O

Solomon O
divided O
the O
men O
into O
three O
groups O
with O
10,000 O
men O
in O
each O
group O
. O

Each O
group O
worked O
one O
month O
in O
Lebanon O
and O
then O
went O
home O
for O
two O
months O
. O

Solomon O
also O
forced O
80,000 O
men O
to O
work O
in O
the O
hill O
country O
cutting O
stone O
. O

There O
were O
also O
70,000 O
men O
to O
carry O
the O
stones O
. O

There O
were O
3300 O
men O
to O
supervise O
the O
workers O
. O

King O
Solomon O
commanded O
them O
to O
cut O
large O
, O
expensive O
stones O
for O
the O
foundation O
of O
the O
Temple O
. O

Then O
Solomon O
and O
Hiram O
's O
builders O
and O
the O
men O
from O
Byblos O
carved O
the O
stones O
and O
prepared O
them O
and O
the O
logs O
for O
use O
in O
building O
the O
Temple O
. O

Abijah O
became O
the O
new O
king O
of O
Judah O
during O
the O
18th O
year O
that O
Jeroboam O
son O
of O
Nebat O
ruled O
Israel O
. O

Abijah O
ruled O
in O
Jerusalem O
for O
three O
years O
. O

His O
mother O
's O
name O
was O
Maacah O
. O

She O
was O
Absalom O
's O
daughter O
. O

He O
did O
all O
the O
same O
sins O
that O
his O
father O
before O
him O
had O
done O
. O

Abijah O
was O
not O
faithful O
to O
the O
Lord O
his O
God O
. O

In O
this O
way O
he O
was O
not O
like O
his O
grandfather O
, O
David O
. O

But O
for O
David O
's O
sake O
, O
the O
Lord O
gave O
Abijah O
a O
kingdom O
in O
Jerusalem O
and O
allowed O
him O
to O
have O
a O
son O
. O

He O
also O
kept O
Jerusalem O
safe O
. O

David O
had O
always O
done O
what O
the O
Lord O
said O
was O
right O
. O

He O
had O
always O
obeyed O
his O
commands O
. O

The O
only O
time O
David O
did O
not O
obey O
him O
was O
when O
he O
sinned O
against O
Uriah O
the O
Hittite O
. O

Rehoboam O
and O
Jeroboam O
were O
always O
fighting O
against O
each O
other O
. O

The O
rest O
of O
what O
Abijah O
did O
is O
written O
in O
the O
book O
, O
The O
History O
of O
the O
Kings O
of O
Judah O
. O

There O
was O
war O
between O
Abijah O
and O
Jeroboam O
during O
the O
whole O
time O
that O
Abijah O
was O
king O
. O

When O
Abijah O
died O
, O
he O
was O
buried O
in O
the O
City O
of O
David O
. O

Abijah O
's O
son O
Asa O
became O
the O
new O
king O
after O
him O
. O

During O
Jeroboam O
's O
20th O
year O
as O
king O
over O
Israel O
, O
Asa O
became O
king O
of O
Judah O
. O

He O
ruled O
in O
Jerusalem O
for O
41 O
years O
. O

His O
grandmother O
's O
name O
was O
Maacah O
, O
and O
she O
was O
the O
daughter O
of O
Absalom O
. O

Asa O
did O
what O
the O
Lord O
said O
is O
right O
, O
as O
his O
ancestor O
David O
did O
. O

During O
Asa O
's O
time O
there O
were O
men O
who O
served O
other O
gods O
by O
selling O
their O
bodies O
for O
sex O
. O

Asa O
forced O
them O
to O
leave O
the O
country O
. O

He O
took O
away O
the O
idols O
that O
his O
ancestors O
had O
made O
. O

King O
Asa O
also O
took O
away O
the O
right O
of O
his O
mother O
Maacah O
to O
be O
queen O
mother O
. O

He O
did O
this O
because O
she O
had O
set O
up O
one O
of O
those O
awful O
poles O
to O
honor O
the O
goddess O
Asherah O
. O

Asa O
cut O
down O
that O
Asherah O
pole O
and O
smashed O
it O
into O
small O
pieces O
and O
burned O
the O
pieces O
in O
the O
Kidron O
Valley O
. O

Asa O
did O
not O
destroy O
the O
high O
places O
, O
even O
though O
he O
was O
faithful O
to O
the O
Lord O
all O
his O
life O
. O

Asa O
and O
his O
father O
had O
given O
some O
special O
gifts O
to O
God O
. O

Asa O
put O
these O
gifts O
of O
gold O
, O
silver O
, O
and O
other O
things O
into O
the O
Temple O
. O

The O
whole O
time O
that O
King O
Asa O
was O
king O
of O
Judah O
, O
he O
fought O
a O
war O
against O
King O
Baasha O
of O
Israel O
. O

Once O
Baasha O
attacked O
Judah O
and O
then O
built O
up O
the O
city O
of O
Ramah O
to O
keep O
Asa O
from O
leaving O
Judah O
on O
any O
kind O
of O
military O
campaign O
. O

So O
Asa O
took O
gold O
and O
silver O
from O
the O
treasuries O
of O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
and O
the O
king O
's O
palace O
. O

He O
gave O
it O
to O
his O
officials O
and O
sent O
them O
to O
King O
Ben-Hadad O
of O
Aram O
. O

Ben-Hadad O
was O
the O
son O
of O
Tabrimmon O
. O

Tabrimmon O
was O
the O
son O
of O
Hezion O
. O

Damascus O
was O
Ben-Hadad O
's O
capital O
city O
. O

Asa O
sent O
this O
message O
: O
`` O
My O
father O
and O
your O
father O
had O
a O
peace O
agreement O
. O

Now O
I O
want O
to O
make O
a O
peace O
agreement O
with O
you O
. O

I O
am O
sending O
you O
this O
gift O
of O
gold O
and O
silver O
. O

Please O
break O
your O
treaty O
with O
King O
Baasha O
of O
Israel O
and O
make O
him O
leave O
us O
alone O
. O
'' O

King O
Ben-Hadad O
made O
the O
agreement O
with O
King O
Asa O
and O
sent O
his O
army O
to O
fight O
against O
the O
Israelite O
towns O
of O
Ijon O
, O
Dan O
, O
Abel O
Beth O
Maacah O
, O
the O
towns O
near O
Lake O
Galilee O
, O
and O
the O
area O
of O
Naphtali O
. O

When O
Baasha O
heard O
about O
these O
attacks O
, O
he O
stopped O
building O
up O
Ramah O
and O
went O
back O
to O
Tirzah O
. O

Then O
King O
Asa O
gave O
an O
order O
to O
all O
the O
men O
in O
Judah O
. O

Everyone O
had O
to O
help O
. O

They O
had O
to O
go O
to O
Ramah O
and O
carry O
out O
all O
the O
stone O
and O
wood O
that O
Baasha O
was O
using O
to O
build O
up O
the O
city O
. O

They O
carried O
the O
material O
to O
Geba O
in O
Benjamin O
and O
to O
Mizpah O
and O
used O
it O
to O
strengthen O
those O
two O
cities O
. O

All O
the O
other O
things O
about O
Asa O
-- O
the O
great O
things O
he O
did O
and O
the O
cities O
he O
built O
-- O
are O
written O
in O
the O
book O
, O
The O
History O
of O
the O
Kings O
of O
Judah O
. O

When O
Asa O
became O
old O
, O
his O
feet O
became O
infected O
. O

He O
died O
and O
was O
buried O
in O
the O
City O
of O
David O
, O
his O
ancestor O
. O

Then O
Asa O
's O
son O
Jehoshaphat O
became O
the O
new O
king O
after O
him O
. O

During O
Asa O
's O
second O
year O
as O
king O
of O
Judah O
, O
Jeroboam O
's O
son O
Nadab O
became O
king O
of O
Israel O
. O

Nadab O
ruled O
over O
Israel O
for O
two O
years O
. O

He O
did O
what O
the O
Lord O
said O
was O
wrong O
. O

He O
sinned O
just O
as O
his O
father O
Jeroboam O
did O
when O
he O
caused O
the O
Israelites O
to O
sin O
. O

Baasha O
was O
the O
son O
of O
Ahijah O
. O

They O
were O
from O
the O
tribe O
of O
Issachar O
. O

Baasha O
made O
a O
plan O
to O
kill O
King O
Nadab O
. O

Nadab O
and O
all O
Israel O
were O
fighting O
against O
the O
Philistine O
town O
of O
Gibbethon O
. O

And O
that O
is O
where O
Baasha O
killed O
Nadab O
. O

This O
happened O
during O
Asa O
's O
third O
year O
as O
king O
of O
Judah O
. O

So O
Baasha O
became O
the O
next O
king O
of O
Israel O
. O

When O
Baasha O
became O
the O
new O
king O
, O
he O
killed O
everyone O
in O
Jeroboam O
's O
family O
. O

He O
left O
no O
one O
in O
Jeroboam O
's O
family O
alive O
. O

This O
happened O
just O
as O
the O
Lord O
said O
it O
would O
when O
he O
spoke O
through O
his O
servant O
Ahijah O
at O
Shiloh O
. O

This O
happened O
because O
King O
Jeroboam O
had O
committed O
many O
sins O
and O
had O
caused O
the O
Israelites O
to O
sin O
. O

This O
made O
the O
Lord O
, O
the O
God O
of O
Israel O
, O
very O
angry O
. O

The O
other O
things O
that O
Nadab O
did O
are O
written O
in O
the O
book O
, O
The O
History O
of O
the O
Kings O
of O
Israel O
. O

All O
during O
the O
time O
that O
Baasha O
ruled O
over O
Israel O
, O
he O
was O
fighting O
wars O
against O
King O
Asa O
of O
Judah O
. O

Ahijah O
's O
son O
Baasha O
became O
king O
of O
Israel O
during O
the O
third O
year O
that O
Asa O
ruled O
over O
Judah O
. O

Baasha O
ruled O
in O
Tirzah O
for O
24 O
years O
, O
but O
he O
did O
what O
the O
Lord O
said O
was O
wrong O
. O

He O
did O
the O
same O
sins O
that O
Jeroboam O
had O
done O
that O
caused O
the O
Israelites O
to O
sin O
. O

King O
David O
was O
very O
old O
and O
could O
not O
keep O
warm O
. O

His O
servants O
covered O
him O
with O
blankets O
, O
but O
he O
was O
still O
cold O
. O

So O
they O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
We O
will O
find O
a O
young O
woman O
to O
care O
for O
you O
. O

She O
will O
lie O
next O
to O
you O
and O
keep O
you O
warm O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
king O
's O
servants O
began O
looking O
everywhere O
in O
the O
country O
of O
Israel O
for O
a O
beautiful O
young O
woman O
to O
keep O
the O
king O
warm O
. O

They O
found O
a O
young O
woman O
named O
Abishag O
, O
from O
the O
town O
of O
Shunem O
, O
and O
brought O
her O
to O
the O
king O
. O

She O
was O
very O
beautiful O
. O

She O
cared O
for O
the O
king O
and O
served O
him O
, O
but O
King O
David O
did O
not O
have O
sexual O
relations O
with O
her O
. O

Adonijah O
was O
the O
son O
of O
King O
David O
and O
his O
wife O
Haggith O
. O

He O
was O
born O
after O
Absalom O
. O

Adonijah O
was O
a O
very O
handsome O
man O
. O

King O
David O
never O
corrected O
his O
son O
Adonijah O
, O
and O
he O
never O
made O
him O
explain O
his O
actions O
. O

Adonijah O
became O
very O
proud O
and O
decided O
that O
he O
would O
be O
the O
next O
king O
. O

He O
wanted O
very O
much O
to O
be O
the O
king O
, O
so O
he O
got O
himself O
a O
chariot O
, O
horses O
, O
and O
50 O
men O
to O
run O
ahead O
of O
him O
. O

Adonijah O
talked O
with O
Joab O
son O
of O
Zeruiah O
and O
Abiathar O
the O
priest O
. O

They O
decided O
to O
help O
make O
him O
the O
new O
king O
, O
but O
several O
important O
men O
did O
not O
join O
Adonijah O
. O

They O
were O
Zadok O
the O
priest O
, O
Benaiah O
son O
of O
Jehoiada O
, O
Nathan O
the O
prophet O
, O
Shimei O
, O
Rei O
, O
and O
King O
David O
's O
special O
guard O
. O

One O
day O
, O
at O
Zoheleth O
Rock O
near O
En O
Rogel O
, O
Adonijah O
sacrificed O
some O
sheep O
, O
cattle O
, O
and O
fat O
calves O
as O
a O
fellowship O
offering O
. O

He O
invited O
his O
brothers O
-LRB- O
the O
other O
sons O
of O
King O
David O
-RRB- O
and O
all O
the O
officers O
from O
Judah O
. O

But O
he O
did O
not O
invite O
his O
brother O
Solomon O
, O
Nathan O
the O
prophet O
, O
Benaiah O
, O
or O
the O
men O
in O
the O
king O
's O
special O
guard O
. O

When O
Nathan O
heard O
about O
this O
, O
he O
went O
to O
Solomon O
's O
mother O
Bathsheba O
and O
asked O
her O
, O
`` O
Have O
you O
heard O
what O
Haggith O
's O
son O
, O
Adonijah O
, O
is O
doing O
? O

He O
is O
making O
himself O
king O
. O

And O
our O
master O
, O
King O
David O
, O
knows O
nothing O
about O
it O
. O

You O
and O
your O
son O
Solomon O
are O
in O
danger O
, O
but O
I O
will O
tell O
you O
what O
to O
do O
to O
save O
yourself O
. O

Go O
to O
King O
David O
and O
tell O
him O
, O
' O
My O
lord O
and O
king O
, O
you O
promised O
me O
that O
my O
son O
Solomon O
would O
be O
the O
next O
king O
after O
you O
. O

So O
why O
is O
Adonijah O
becoming O
the O
new O
king O
? O
' O

Then O
while O
you O
are O
still O
talking O
with O
him O
, O
I O
will O
come O
in O
. O

After O
you O
leave O
I O
will O
tell O
the O
king O
what O
has O
happened O
. O

This O
will O
show O
that O
what O
you O
said O
is O
true O
. O
'' O

So O
Bathsheba O
went O
in O
to O
see O
the O
king O
in O
his O
bedroom O
. O

The O
king O
was O
very O
old O
. O

Abishag O
, O
the O
girl O
from O
Shunem O
, O
was O
caring O
for O
him O
there O
. O

Bathsheba O
bowed O
down O
before O
the O
king O
. O

The O
king O
asked O
, O
`` O
What O
can O
I O
do O
for O
you O
? O
'' O

Bathsheba O
answered O
, O
`` O
Sir O
, O
you O
used O
the O
name O
of O
the O
Lord O
your O
God O
and O
made O
a O
promise O
to O
me O
. O

You O
said O
, O
' O
Your O
son O
Solomon O
will O
be O
the O
next O
king O
after O
me O
. O

He O
will O
sit O
on O
my O
throne O
. O
' O

Now O
, O
you O
do O
n't O
know O
this O
, O
but O
Adonijah O
is O
making O
himself O
king O
. O

He O
is O
giving O
a O
big O
fellowship O
meal O
. O

He O
has O
killed O
many O
cattle O
and O
the O
best O
sheep O
, O
and O
he O
has O
invited O
all O
of O
your O
sons O
to O
the O
meal O
. O

He O
also O
invited O
Abiathar O
the O
priest O
and O
Joab O
, O
the O
commander O
of O
your O
army O
, O
but O
he O
did O
not O
invite O
your O
faithful O
son O
Solomon O
. O

Now O
, O
my O
lord O
and O
king O
, O
all O
the O
Israelites O
are O
watching O
you O
. O

They O
are O
waiting O
for O
you O
to O
decide O
who O
will O
be O
the O
next O
king O
after O
you O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
decide O
, O
then O
after O
you O
are O
buried O
, O
these O
men O
will O
say O
that O
Solomon O
and O
I O
are O
criminals O
. O
'' O

While O
Bathsheba O
was O
still O
talking O
with O
the O
king O
, O
Nathan O
the O
prophet O
came O
to O
see O
him O
. O

The O
servants O
told O
the O
king O
, O
`` O
Nathan O
the O
prophet O
is O
here O
. O
'' O

Nathan O
went O
in O
to O
speak O
to O
the O
king O
. O

He O
bowed O
down O
before O
the O
king O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
My O
lord O
and O
king O
, O
did O
you O
announce O
that O
Adonijah O
will O
be O
the O
new O
king O
after O
you O
? O

Have O
you O
decided O
that O
he O
will O
rule O
the O
people O
now O
? O

Today O
he O
went O
down O
into O
the O
valley O
to O
offer O
many O
cattle O
and O
the O
best O
sheep O
as O
fellowship O
offerings O
. O

He O
invited O
all O
your O
other O
sons O
, O
the O
commanders O
of O
the O
army O
, O
and O
Abiathar O
the O
priest O
. O

They O
are O
now O
eating O
and O
drinking O
with O
him O
. O

And O
they O
are O
saying O
, O
' O
Long O
live O
King O
Adonijah O
! O
' O

But O
he O
did O
not O
invite O
me O
, O
or O
Zadok O
the O
priest O
, O
or O
Benaiah O
son O
of O
Jehoiada O
, O
or O
your O
son O
Solomon O
. O

My O
lord O
and O
king O
, O
did O
you O
do O
this O
without O
telling O
us O
? O

Please O
tell O
us O
, O
who O
will O
be O
the O
next O
king O

you O
? O
'' O

Then O
King O
David O
said O
, O
`` O
Tell O
Bathsheba O
to O
come O
in O
! O
'' O

So O
she O
came O
in O
and O
stood O
before O
the O
king O
. O

Then O
the O
king O
made O
a O
promise O
: O
`` O
The O
Lord O
God O
has O
saved O
me O
from O
every O
danger O

As O
surely O
as O
he O
lives O

I O
make O
this O
promise O
to O
you O
. O

Today O
I O
will O
do O
what O
I O
promised O
you O
in O
the O
past O

I O
made O
that O
promise O
by O
the O
power O
of O
the O
Lord O
, O
the O
God O
of O
Israel O
. O

I O
promised O
that O
your O
son O
Solomon O
would O
be O
the O
next O
king O
after O
me O
. O

I O
promised O
that O
he O
would O
take O
my O
place O
on O
my O
throne O
, O
and O
I O
will O
keep O
my O
promise O
! O
'' O

Then O
Bathsheba O
bowed O
down O
before O
the O
king O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Long O
live O
King O
David O
! O
'' O

Then O
King O
David O
said O
, O
`` O
Tell O
Zadok O
the O
priest O
, O
Nathan O
the O
prophet O
, O
and O
Benaiah O
son O
of O
Jehoiada O
to O
come O
in O
here O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
three O
men O
came O
in O
to O
meet O
with O
the O
king O
. O

Then O
the O
king O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Take O
my O
officers O
with O
you O
. O

Put O
my O
son O
Solomon O
on O
my O
mule O
and O
take O
him O
to O
Gihon O
Spring O
. O

There O
Zadok O
the O
priest O
and O
Nathan O
the O
prophet O
will O
anoint O
him O
to O
be O
the O
new O
king O
of O
Israel O
. O

Blow O
the O
trumpet O
and O
announce O
, O
' O
This O
is O
the O
new O
king O
, O
Solomon O
! O
' O

Then O
come O
back O
here O
with O
him O
. O

Solomon O
will O
sit O
on O
my O
throne O
and O
be O
the O
new O
king O
in O
my O
place O
. O

I O
have O
chosen O
him O
to O
be O
the O
ruler O
of O
Israel O
and O
Judah O
. O
'' O

Benaiah O
son O
of O
Jehoiada O
answered O
the O
king O
, O
`` O
Amen O
! O

It O
is O
as O
true O
as O
if O
the O
Lord O
God O
himself O
had O
said O
it O
, O
my O
lord O
and O
king O

My O
lord O
and O
king O
, O
the O
Lord O
has O
been O
with O
you O
, O
and O
now O
I O
pray O
the O
Lord O
will O
be O
with O
Solomon O
! O

And O
I O
pray O
King O
Solomon O
's O
kingdom O
will O
grow O
and O
be O
even O
more O
powerful O
than O
yours O
, O
my O
lord O
and O
king O
. O
'' O

So O
Zadok O
, O
Nathan O
, O
Benaiah O
, O
and O
the O
king O
's O
officers O
obeyed O
King O
David O
. O

They O
put O
Solomon O
on O
David O
's O
mule O
and O
went O
with O
him O
down O
to O
Gihon O
Spring O
. O

Zadok O
the O
priest O
carried O
the O
oil O
from O
the O
Holy O
Tent O
and O
poured O
it O
on O
Solomon O
's O
head O
to O
show O
that O
he O
was O
the O
new O
king O
. O

They O
blew O
the O
trumpet O
and O
all O
the O
people O
shouted O
, O
`` O
Long O
live O
King O
Solomon O
! O
'' O

Then O
all O
the O
people O
followed O
Solomon O
back O
into O
the O
city O
. O

They O
were O
very O
happy O
and O
excited O
. O

They O
were O
playing O
flutes O
and O
making O
so O
much O
noise O
that O
the O
ground O
shook O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
Adonijah O
and O
his O
guests O
were O
just O
finishing O
their O
meal O
. O

They O
heard O
the O
sound O
of O
the O
trumpet O
, O
and O
Joab O
asked O
, O
`` O
What O
is O
that O
noise O
? O

What O
is O
happening O
in O
the O
city O
? O
'' O

While O
Joab O
was O
still O
speaking O
, O
Jonathan O
, O
son O
of O
Abiathar O
the O
priest O
, O
arrived O
. O

Adonijah O
said O
, O
`` O
Come O
here O
! O

You O
are O
a O
good O
man O
, O
so O
you O
must O
be O
bringing O
good O
news O
. O
'' O

But O
Jonathan O
answered O
, O
`` O
No O
, O
it O
is O
not O
good O
news O
for O
you O
! O

King O
David O
has O
made O
Solomon O
the O
new O
king O
. O

King O
David O
sent O
Zadok O
the O
priest O
, O
Nathan O
the O
prophet O
, O
Benaiah O
son O
of O
Jehoiada O
, O
and O
all O
the O
king O
's O
officers O
with O
Solomon O
out O
to O
Gihon O
Spring O
. O

They O
put O
Solomon O
on O
the O
king O
's O
mule O
. O

Zadok O
the O
priest O
and O
Nathan O
the O
prophet O
anointed O
Solomon O
at O
Gihon O
Spring O
and O
then O
went O
back O
into O
the O
city O
. O

The O
people O
followed O
them O
, O
and O
now O
everyone O
in O
the O
city O
is O
celebrating O
. O

That O
is O
the O
noise O
you O
hear O
. O

Solomon O
is O
sitting O
on O
the O
king O
's O
throne O
and O
the O
king O
's O
officers O
are O
congratulating O
King O
David O
, O
saying O
, O
' O
King O
David O
, O
you O
are O
a O
great O
king O
! O
' O

And O
now O
we O
pray O
that O
your O
God O
will O
make O
Solomon O
a O
great O
king O
too O
. O

We O
pray O
your O
God O
will O
make O
him O
even O
more O
famous O
than O
you O
. O

And O
we O
pray O
that O
his O
kingdom O
will O
be O
even O
greater O
than O
yours O
is O
! O

Even O
King O
David O
was O
there O
. O

From O
his O
bed O
, O
the O
king O
bowed O
before O
Solomon O
and O
said O
, O
' O
Praise O
the O
Lord O
, O
the O
God O
of O
Israel O
. O

The O
Lord O
put O
one O
of O
my O
own O
sons O
on O
my O
throne O
, O
and O
he O
let O
me O
live O
to O
see O
it O
. O
' O
'' O

All O
of O
Adonijah O
's O
guests O
were O
afraid O
and O
left O
very O
quickly O
. O

Adonijah O
was O
also O
afraid O
of O
Solomon O
, O
so O
he O
went O
to O
the O
altar O
and O
held O
onto O
the O
horns O
of O
the O
altar O
. O

Then O
someone O
told O
Solomon O
, O
`` O
Adonijah O
is O
afraid O
of O
you O
, O
King O
Solomon O
. O

He O
is O
at O
the O
Holy O
Tent O
holding O
onto O
the O
horns O
of O
the O
altar O
, O
and O
he O
refuses O
to O
leave O
. O

Adonijah O
says O
, O
' O
Tell O
King O
Solomon O
to O
promise O
that O
he O
will O
not O
kill O
me O
. O
' O
'' O

So O
Solomon O
answered O
, O
`` O
If O
Adonijah O
shows O
that O
he O
is O
a O
good O
man O
, O
I O
promise O
that O
not O
a O
hair O
on O
his O
head O
will O
be O
hurt O
. O

But O
if O
he O
does O
anything O
wrong O
, O
he O
will O
die O
. O
'' O

Then O
King O
Solomon O
sent O
some O
men O
to O
get O
Adonijah O
and O
brought O
him O
in O
. O

He O
approached O
the O
king O
and O
bowed O
before O
him O
. O

Then O
Solomon O
said O
, O
`` O
Go O
home O
. O
'' O

During O
the O
third O
year O
that O
no O
rain O
fell O
, O
the O
Lord O
said O
to O
Elijah O
, O
`` O
Go O
meet O
with O
King O
Ahab O
, O
and O
I O
will O
make O
it O
rain O
. O
'' O

So O
Elijah O
went O
to O
meet O
with O
Ahab O
. O

The O
famine O
was O
very O
bad O
in O
Samaria O
. O

So O
King O
Ahab O
told O
Obadiah O
to O
come O
to O
him O
. O

Obadiah O
was O
the O
man O
in O
charge O
of O
the O
king O
's O
palace O
. O

-LRB- O
Obadiah O
was O
a O
true O
follower O
of O
the O
Lord O
. O

One O
time O
when O
Jezebel O
was O
killing O
all O
the O
Lord O
's O
prophets O
, O
Obadiah O
hid O
100 O
prophets O
in O
two O
caves O
. O

He O
put O
50 O
prophets O
in O
one O
cave O
and O
50 O
prophets O
in O
another O
cave O
. O

Then O
he O
brought O
them O
food O
and O
water O
. O
-RRB- O

King O
Ahab O
said O
to O
Obadiah O
, O
`` O
Come O
with O
me O
. O

We O
will O
look O
at O
every O
spring O
and O
every O
stream O
in O
the O
land O
. O

We O
will O
see O
if O
we O
can O
find O
enough O
grass O
to O
keep O
our O
horses O
and O
mules O
alive O
. O

Then O
we O
will O
not O
have O
to O
kill O
our O
animals O
. O
'' O

They O
decided O
where O
each O
of O
them O
would O
go O
to O
look O
for O
water O
. O

Ahab O
went O
in O
one O
direction O
by O
himself O
, O
and O
Obadiah O
went O
in O
another O
direction O
by O
himself O
. O

As O
Obadiah O
was O
walking O
along O
the O
road O
by O
himself O
, O
he O
looked O
up O
, O
and O
there O
was O
Elijah O
. O

Obadiah O
recognized O
him O
and O
bowed O
down O
to O
show O
his O
respect O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Elijah O
? O

Is O
it O
really O
you O
, O
master O
? O
'' O

Elijah O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
it O
is O
me O
. O

Now O
, O
go O
and O
tell O
your O
master O
, O
the O
king O
, O
that O
I O
am O
here O
. O
'' O

Obadiah O
said O
, O
`` O
If O
I O
tell O
Ahab O
that O
I O
know O
where O
you O
are O
, O
he O
will O
kill O
me O
! O

I O
have O
done O
nothing O
wrong O
to O
you O
. O

Why O
do O
you O
want O
me O
to O
die O
? O

As O
surely O
as O
the O
Lord O
your O
God O
lives O
, O
the O
king O
has O
been O
looking O
for O
you O
everywhere O
. O

He O
has O
sent O
people O
to O
every O
country O
to O
find O
you O
. O

He O
even O
made O
the O
rulers O
of O
those O
countries O
swear O
that O
you O
were O
not O
there O
. O

Now O
you O
want O
me O
to O
go O
and O
tell O
him O
that O
you O
are O
here O
! O

If O
I O
go O
tell O
King O
Ahab O
that O
you O
are O
here O
, O
the O
Lord O
might O
carry O
you O
away O
. O

Then O
when O
King O
Ahab O
comes O
here O
and O
can O
not O
find O
you O
, O
he O
will O
kill O
me O
! O

I O
have O
followed O
the O
Lord O
since O
I O
was O
a O
boy O
. O

You O
heard O
what O
I O
did O
. O

When O
Jezebel O
was O
killing O
the O
Lord O
's O
prophets O
, O
I O
hid O
100 O
of O
them O
in O
caves O
. O

I O
put O
50 O
prophets O
in O
one O
cave O
and O
50 O
prophets O
in O
another O
cave O
. O

I O
brought O
them O
food O
and O
water O
. O

Now O
you O
want O
me O
to O
go O
and O
tell O
the O
king O
that O
you O
are O
here O
. O

The O
king O
will O
kill O
me O
! O
'' O

Elijah O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
serve O
the O
Lord O
All-Powerful O
. O

As O
surely O
as O
he O
lives O
, O
I O
promise O
that O
I O
will O
stand O
before O
the O
king O
today O
. O
'' O

So O
Obadiah O
went O
to O
King O
Ahab O
and O
told O
him O
where O
Elijah O
was O
. O

King O
Ahab O
went O
to O
meet O
Elijah O
. O

When O
Ahab O
saw O
Elijah O
he O
said O
, O
`` O
Is O
that O
really O
you O
, O
the O
troublemaker O
of O
Israel O
? O
'' O

Elijah O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
have O
not O
made O
trouble O
for O
Israel O
. O

You O
and O
your O
father O
's O
family O
caused O
all O
the O
problems O
when O
you O
stopped O
obeying O
the O
Lord O
's O
commands O
and O
began O
following O
the O
false O
gods O
. O

Now O
tell O
all O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
to O
meet O
me O
at O
Mount O
Carmel O
. O

Also O
bring O
the O
450 O
prophets O
of O
Baal O
and O
the O
400 O
prophets O
of O
the O
goddess O
Asherah O
that O
Queen O
Jezebel O
supports O
. O
'' O

So O
Ahab O
called O
all O
the O
Israelites O
and O
those O
prophets O
to O
Mount O
Carmel O
. O

Elijah O
came O
to O
all O
the O
people O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
must O
decide O
what O
you O
are O
going O
to O
do O
. O

How O
long O
will O
you O
keep O
jumping O
from O
one O
side O
to O
the O
other O
? O

If O
the O
Lord O
is O
the O
true O
God O
, O
follow O
him O
. O

But O
if O
Baal O
is O
the O
true O
God O
, O
then O
follow O
him O
! O
'' O

The O
people O
said O
nothing O
. O

So O
Elijah O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
the O
only O
prophet O
of O
the O
Lord O
here O
, O
but O
there O
are O
450 O
prophets O
of O
Baal O
. O

So O
bring O
us O
two O
bulls O
. O

Let O
the O
prophets O
of O
Baal O
have O
one O
bull O
. O

Let O
them O
kill O
it O
and O
cut O
it O
into O
pieces O
and O
then O
put O
the O
meat O
on O
the O
wood O
. O

But O
do O
n't O
start O
the O
fire O
. O

I O
will O
do O
the O
same O
with O
the O
other O
bull O
, O
and O
I O
will O
not O
start O
the O
fire O
either O
. O

Prophets O
of O
Baal O
, O
pray O
to O
your O
god O
, O
and O
I O
will O
pray O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

Whichever O
god O
answers O
the O
prayer O
and O
starts O
the O
fire O
is O
the O
true O
God O
. O
'' O

All O
the O
people O
agreed O
that O
this O
was O
a O
good O
idea O
. O

Then O
Elijah O
said O
to O
the O
prophets O
of O
Baal O
, O
`` O
There O
are O
many O
of O
you O
, O
so O
you O
go O
first O
. O

Choose O
a O
bull O
and O
prepare O
it O
, O
but O
do O
n't O
start O
your O
fire O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
prophets O
took O
the O
bull O
that O
was O
given O
to O
them O
and O
prepared O
it O
. O

They O
started O
praying O
to O
Baal O
and O
prayed O
until O
noon O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Baal O
, O
please O
answer O
us O
! O
'' O

But O
there O
was O
no O
sound O
. O

No O
one O
answered O
. O

Then O
they O
began O
jumping O
around O
on O
the O
altar O
they O
had O
built O
. O

At O
noon O
Elijah O
began O
to O
make O
fun O
of O
them O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
If O
Baal O
really O
is O
a O
god O
, O
maybe O
you O
should O
pray O
louder O
! O

Maybe O
he O
is O
busy O
. O

Maybe O
he O
is O
thinking O
about O
something O
, O
or O
maybe O
he O
stepped O
out O
for O
a O
moment O
! O

He O
could O
be O
sleeping O
! O

Maybe O
you O
should O
pray O
louder O
and O
wake O
him O
up O
! O
'' O

So O
the O
prophets O
prayed O
louder O
. O

They O
cut O
themselves O
with O
swords O
and O
spears O
. O

-LRB- O
This O
was O
the O
way O
they O
worshiped O
. O
-RRB- O

They O
cut O
themselves O
until O
they O
were O
bleeding O
all O
over O
. O

The O
afternoon O
passed O
but O
the O
fire O
still O
had O
not O
started O
. O

The O
prophets O
were O
out O
of O
control O
and O
continued O
to O
act O
this O
way O
until O
the O
time O
came O
for O
the O
evening O
sacrifice O
. O

But O
nothing O
happened O
-- O
there O
was O
no O
answer O
from O
Baal O
. O

There O
was O
no O
sound O
. O

There O
was O
no O
one O
listening O
. O

Then O
Elijah O
said O
to O
all O
the O
people O
, O
`` O
Now O
come O
here O
. O
'' O

So O
they O
gathered O
around O
Elijah O
. O

The O
Lord O
's O
altar O
had O
been O
torn O
down O
, O
so O
Elijah O
repaired O
it O
. O

Elijah O
found O
twelve O
stones O
. O

There O
was O
one O
stone O
for O
each O
of O
the O
twelve O
tribes O
. O

These O
twelve O
tribes O
were O
named O
for O
the O
twelve O
sons O
of O
Jacob O
, O
the O
man O
who O
the O
Lord O
had O
named O
Israel O
. O

Elijah O
used O
these O
stones O
to O
repair O
the O
altar O
to O
honor O
the O
Lord O
. O

He O
dug O
a O
small O
ditch O
around O
the O
altar O
. O

It O
was O
wide O
enough O
and O
deep O
enough O
to O
hold O
about O
4 O
gallons O
of O
water O
. O

Then O
Elijah O
put O
the O
wood O
on O
the O
altar O
. O

He O
cut O
the O
bull O
into O
pieces O
and O
laid O
the O
pieces O
on O
the O
wood O
. O

Then O
he O
said O
, O
`` O
Fill O
four O
jars O
with O
water O
. O

Pour O
the O
water O
on O
the O
pieces O
of O
meat O
and O
on O
the O
wood O
. O
'' O

Then O
Elijah O
said O
, O
`` O
Do O
it O
again O
. O
'' O

Then O
he O
said O
, O
`` O
Do O
it O
a O
third O
time O
. O
'' O

The O
water O
ran O
down O
off O
the O
altar O
and O
filled O
the O
ditch O
. O

At O
about O
the O
time O
for O
the O
afternoon O
sacrifice O
, O
the O
prophet O
Elijah O
approached O
the O
altar O
and O
prayed O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
the O
God O
of O
Abraham O
, O
Isaac O
, O
and O
Jacob O
, O
I O
ask O
you O
now O
to O
prove O
that O
you O
are O
the O
God O
of O
Israel O
and O
that O
I O
am O
your O
servant O
. O

Show O
these O
people O
that O
it O
was O
you O
who O
commanded O
me O
to O
do O
all O
these O
things O
. O

Lord O
, O
answer O
my O
prayer O
. O

Show O
these O
people O
that O
you O
, O
Lord O
, O
are O
God O
and O
that O
you O
are O
the O
one O
who O
is O
bringing O
them O
back O
to O
you O
. O
'' O

Then O
fire O
came O
down O
from O
the O
Lord O
and O
burned O
the O
sacrifice O
, O
the O
wood O
, O
the O
stones O
, O
and O
the O
ground O
around O
the O
altar O
. O

Then O
it O
dried O
up O
all O
the O
water O
in O
the O
ditch O
. O

All O
the O
people O
saw O
this O
happen O
and O
bowed O
down O
to O
the O
ground O
and O
began O
saying O
, O
`` O
The O
Lord O
is O
God O
! O

The O
Lord O
is O
God O
! O
'' O

Then O
Elijah O
said O
, O
`` O
Get O
the O
prophets O
of O
Baal O
! O

Do O
n't O
let O
any O
of O
them O
escape O
! O
'' O

So O
the O
people O
captured O
all O
the O
prophets O
. O

Then O
Elijah O
led O
them O
down O
to O
Kishon O
Creek O
and O
killed O
them O
all O
. O

Then O
Elijah O
said O
to O
King O
Ahab O
, O
`` O
Now O
go O
eat O
and O
drink O
. O

A O
heavy O
rain O
is O
coming O
. O
'' O

So O
King O
Ahab O
went O
to O
eat O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
Elijah O
climbed O
to O
the O
top O
of O
Mount O
Carmel O
. O

At O
the O
top O
of O
the O
mountain O
Elijah O
bent O
down O
. O

He O
put O
his O
head O
between O
his O
knees O
. O

Then O
Elijah O
said O
to O
his O
servant O
, O
`` O
Go O
up O
higher O
and O
look O
toward O
the O
sea O
. O
'' O

The O
servant O
went O
and O
looked O
. O

He O
came O
back O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
saw O
nothing O
. O
'' O

Elijah O
told O
him O
to O
go O
look O
again O
. O

This O
happened O
seven O
times O
. O

The O
seventh O
time O
, O
the O
servant O
came O
back O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
saw O
a O
small O
cloud O
the O
size O
of O
a O
man O
's O
fist O
that O
was O
coming O
in O
from O
the O
sea O
. O
'' O

Elijah O
told O
the O
servant O
, O
`` O
Go O
tell O
King O
Ahab O
to O
get O
his O
chariot O
ready O
and O
go O
home O
now O
. O

If O
he O
does O
not O
leave O
now O
, O
the O
rain O
will O
stop O
him O
. O
'' O

After O
a O
short O
time O
the O
sky O
was O
covered O
with O
dark O
clouds O
. O

The O
wind O
began O
to O
blow O
, O
and O
a O
heavy O
rain O
began O
to O
fall O
. O

Ahab O
got O
in O
his O
chariot O
and O
started O
back O
to O
Jezreel O
. O

The O
power O
of O
the O
Lord O
came O
to O
Elijah O
. O

He O
used O
his O
belt O
to O
hold O
up O
the O
bottom O
of O
his O
robe O
away O
from O
his O
feet O
. O

Then O
he O
ran O
ahead O
of O
King O
Ahab O
all O
the O
way O
to O
Jezreel O
. O

Then O
the O
Lord O
spoke O
against O
King O
Baasha O
through O
the O
prophet O
, O
Jehu O
son O
of O
Hanani O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
made O
you O
an O
important O
prince O
over O
my O
people O
Israel O
. O

But O
you O
have O
done O
the O
same O
things O
Jeroboam O
did O
. O

You O
have O
caused O
my O
people O
Israel O
to O
sin O
. O

Their O
sins O
have O
made O
me O
angry O
. O

So O
Baasha O
, O
I O
will O
destroy O
you O
and O
your O
family O
, O
just O
as O
I O
did O
Jeroboam O
son O
of O
Nebat O
and O
his O
family O
. O

Dogs O
will O
eat O
the O
bodies O
of O
those O
in O
your O
family O
who O
die O
in O
the O
city O
. O

And O
wild O
birds O
will O
eat O
the O
bodies O
of O
those O
who O
die O
out O
in O
the O
fields O
. O
'' O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
story O
about O
Baasha O
and O
the O
great O
things O
he O
did O
are O
written O
in O
the O
book O
, O
The O
History O
of O
the O
Kings O
of O
Israel O
. O

Baasha O
died O
and O
was O
buried O
in O
Tirzah O
. O

His O
son O
Elah O
became O
the O
new O
king O
after O
him O
. O

That O
book O
also O
has O
the O
story O
of O
the O
time O
the O
Lord O
gave O
the O
message O
to O
Jehu O
the O
prophet O
about O
Baasha O
and O
his O
family O
. O

Baasha O
did O
many O
things O
the O
Lord O
said O
were O
wrong O
, O
just O
as O
Jeroboam O
and O
his O
family O
had O
done O
. O

This O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
Baasha O
had O
killed O
everyone O
in O
Jeroboam O
's O
family O
made O
the O
Lord O
very O
angry O
. O

Elah O
son O
of O
Baasha O
became O
king O
during O
the O
26th O
year O
that O
Asa O
was O
the O
king O
of O
Judah O
. O

He O
ruled O
in O
Tirzah O
for O
two O
years O
. O

Zimri O
was O
one O
of O
King O
Elah O
's O
officers O
. O

Zimri O
commanded O
half O
of O
Elah O
's O
chariots O
, O
but O
Zimri O
plotted O
against O
Elah O
. O

King O
Elah O
was O
in O
Tirzah O
, O
drinking O
and O
getting O
drunk O
at O
Arza O
's O
home O
. O

Arza O
was O
the O
man O
in O
charge O
of O
the O
palace O
at O
Tirzah O
. O

Zimri O
went O
into O
the O
house O
and O
killed O
King O
Elah O
. O

Then O
Zimri O
became O
the O
new O
king O
of O
Israel O
after O
Elah O
. O

This O
was O
during O
the O
27th O
year O
that O
Asa O
was O
king O
in O
Judah O
. O

After O
Zimri O
became O
the O
new O
king O
, O
he O
killed O
all O
of O
Baasha O
's O
family O
and O
friends O
. O

He O
did O
not O
let O
any O
male O
in O
Baasha O
's O
family O
live O
. O

So O
Zimri O
destroyed O
Baasha O
's O
family O
just O
as O
the O
Lord O
said O
he O
would O
when O
he O
spoke O
against O
Baasha O
through O
the O
prophet O
Jehu O
. O

This O
happened O
because O
of O
all O
the O
sins O
of O
Baasha O
and O
his O
son O
, O
Elah O
. O

They O
sinned O
and O
they O
caused O
the O
Israelites O
to O
sin O
. O

They O
worshiped O
worthless O
idols O
, O
and O
this O
made O
the O
Lord O
angry O
. O

The O
rest O
of O
what O
that O
Elah O
did O
is O
written O
in O
the O
book O
, O
The O
History O
of O
the O
Kings O
of O
Israel O
. O

Zimri O
became O
king O
of O
Israel O
during O
the O
27th O
year O
that O
Asa O
was O
king O
of O
Judah O
. O

Zimri O
ruled O
in O
Tirzah O
only O
seven O
days O
. O

This O
is O
what O
happened O
: O
The O
army O
of O
Israel O
was O
at O
Gibbethon O
, O
which O
was O
under O
Philistine O
control O
. O

Omri O
was O
the O
commander O
of O
the O
army O
of O
Israel O
. O

The O
men O
in O
the O
camp O
heard O
that O
Zimri O
had O
made O
secret O
plans O
against O
the O
king O
and O
killed O
him O
. O

So O
in O
the O
camp O
all O
the O
soldiers O
made O
Omri O
the O
new O
king O
. O

Then O
Omri O
and O
all O
the O
soldiers O
of O
Israel O
left O
Gibbethon O
and O
went O
to O
Tirzah O
. O

They O
surrounded O
the O
city O
and O
attacked O
it O
. O

When O
Zimri O
saw O
the O
city O
had O
been O
captured O
, O
he O
ran O
to O
the O
palace O
fortress O
, O
but O
the O
soldiers O
burned O
it O
down O
with O
him O
still O
in O
it O
. O

So O
Zimri O
died O
because O
he O
sinned O
and O
did O
what O
the O
Lord O
said O
was O
wrong O
, O
just O
as O
Jeroboam O
did O
when O
he O
caused O
the O
Israelites O
to O
sin O
. O

The O
story O
about O
Zimri O
's O
secret O
plans O
and O
the O
other O
things O
that O
he O
did O
are O
written O
in O
the O
book O
, O
The O
History O
of O
the O
Kings O
of O
Israel O
. O

Then O
the O
Israelites O
were O
divided O
. O

Half O
of O
the O
people O
followed O
Tibni O
the O
son O
of O
Ginath O
and O
wanted O
to O
make O
him O
king O
. O

The O
other O
half O
of O
the O
people O
followed O
Omri O
. O

But O
Omri O
's O
followers O
were O
stronger O
than O
the O
followers O
of O
Tibni O
son O
of O
Ginath O
. O

Tibni O
died O
, O
and O
Omri O
became O
king O
. O

Omri O
became O
king O
of O
Israel O
during O
Asa O
's O
31st O
year O
as O
the O
king O
of O
Judah O
. O

Omri O
ruled O
over O
Israel O
for O
12 O
years O
. O

Six O
of O
those O
years O
he O
ruled O
from O
Tirzah O
. O

Then O
Omri O
bought O
the O
hill O
of O
Samaria O
from O
Shemer O
for O
about O
150 O
pounds O
of O
silver O
. O

Omri O
built O
a O
city O
on O
that O
hill O
. O

He O
named O
the O
city O
Samaria O
after O
the O
name O
of O
its O
owner O
, O
Shemer O
. O

Omri O
did O
what O
the O
Lord O
said O
was O
wrong O
. O

He O
was O
worse O
than O
all O
the O
kings O
who O
were O
before O
him O
. O

He O
committed O
all O
the O
sins O
that O
Jeroboam O
son O
of O
Nebat O
had O
committed O
when O
he O
caused O
the O
Israelites O
to O
sin O
. O

They O
worshiped O
worthless O
idols O
, O
and O
this O
made O
the O
Lord O
, O
the O
God O
of O
Israel O
, O
very O
angry O
. O

Omri O

The O
History O

of O
Israel O
. O

Omri O
died O
and O
was O
buried O
in O
Samaria O
. O

His O
son O
Ahab O
became O
the O
new O
king O
after O
him O
. O

Ahab O
son O
of O
Omri O
became O
king O
of O
Israel O
during O
the O
38th O
year O
that O
Asa O
was O
king O
of O
Judah O
. O

Ahab O
ruled O
Israel O
from O
the O
town O
of O
Samaria O
for O
22 O
years O
. O

He O
did O
what O
the O
Lord O
said O
was O
wrong O
. O

Ahab O
was O
worse O
than O
all O
the O
kings O
who O
were O
before O
him O
. O

It O
was O
not O
enough O
for O
Ahab O
to O
commit O
the O
same O
sins O
that O
Jeroboam O
, O
son O
of O
Nebat O
, O
had O
done O
. O

Ahab O
also O
married O
Jezebel O
, O
daughter O
of O
King O
Ethbaal O
of O
Sidon O
. O

Then O
Ahab O
began O
to O
serve O
and O
worship O
Baal O
. O

He O
built O
a O
temple O
and O
an O
altar O
in O
Samaria O
for O
worshiping O
Baal O
. O

He O
also O
set O
up O
a O
sacred O
pole O
. O

Ahab O
did O
more O
to O
make O
the O
Lord O
, O
the O
God O
of O
Israel O
, O
angry O
than O
all O
the O
other O
kings O
who O
were O
before O
him O
. O

During O
Ahab O
's O
time O
, O
Hiel O
from O
Bethel O
rebuilt O
the O
town O
of O
Jericho O
. O

When O
Hiel O
started O
work O
on O
the O
city O
, O
his O
oldest O
son O
Abiram O
died O
. O

And O
when O
Hiel O
built O
the O
gates O
of O
the O
city O
, O
his O
youngest O
son O
Segub O
died O
. O

This O
happened O
just O
as O
the O
Lord O
said O
it O
would O
happen O
when O
he O
spoke O
through O
Joshua O
son O
of O
Nun O
. O

King O
Solomon O
loved O
many O
foreign O
women O
, O
including O
the O
daughter O
of O
Pharaoh O
and O
women O
from O
Moab O
, O
Ammon O
, O
Edom O
, O
Sidon O
, O
and O
the O
Hittites O
. O

In O
the O
past O
the O
Lord O
had O
said O
to O
the O
Israelites O
, O
`` O
You O
must O
not O
marry O
people O
from O
other O
nations O
. O

If O
you O
do O
, O
they O
will O
cause O
you O
to O
follow O
their O
gods O
. O
'' O

But O
Solomon O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
these O
women O
. O

He O
had O
700 O
wives O
who O
were O
the O
daughters O
of O
leaders O
from O
other O
nations O
. O

He O
also O
had O
300 O
slave O
women O
who O
were O
like O
wives O
to O
him O
. O

His O
wives O
caused O
him O
to O
turn O
away O
from O
God O
. O

When O
Solomon O
was O
old O
, O
his O
wives O
caused O
him O
to O
follow O
other O
gods O
, O
so O
he O
did O
not O
follow O
the O
Lord O
completely O
as O
his O
father O
David O
did O
. O

Solomon O
worshiped O
Ashtoreth O
, O
the O
goddess O
of O
Sidon O
, O
and O
Milcom O
, O
the O
horrible O
god O
of O
the O
Ammonites O
. O

So O
Solomon O
did O
what O
the O
Lord O
said O
was O
wrong O
. O

He O
did O
not O
follow O
the O
Lord O
completely O
as O
his O
father O
David O
did O
. O

On O
the O
mountain O
next O
to O
Jerusalem O
, O
Solomon O
built O
a O
place O
for O
worshiping O
Chemosh O
, O
that O
horrible O
idol O
of O
the O
Moabites O
. O

On O
the O
same O
mountain O
, O
Solomon O
built O
a O
place O
for O
worshiping O
Molech O
, O
that O
horrible O
idol O
of O
the O
Ammonites O
. O

Solomon O
did O
the O
same O
thing O
for O
all O
of O
his O
other O
foreign O
wives O
who O
burned O
incense O
and O
gave O
sacrifices O
to O
their O
gods O
. O

So O
Solomon O
did O
not O
remain O
faithful O
to O
the O
Lord O
, O
the O
God O
of O
Israel O
, O
even O
though O
God O
had O
appeared O
to O
him O
twice O
. O

The O
Lord O
became O
angry O
with O
him O
. O

He O
had O
told O
Solomon O
that O
he O
must O
not O
follow O
other O
gods O
, O
but O
Solomon O
did O
not O
obey O
the O
Lord O
's O
command O
. O

So O
the O
Lord O
said O
to O
Solomon O
, O
`` O
You O
have O
chosen O
to O
break O
your O
agreement O
with O
me O
. O

You O
have O
not O
obeyed O
my O
commands O
. O

So O
I O
promise O
that O
I O
will O
tear O
your O
kingdom O
away O
from O
you O
and O
give O
it O
to O
one O
of O
your O
servants O
. O

But O
I O
loved O
your O
father O
David O
, O
so O
I O
will O
not O
take O
your O
kingdom O
away O
from O
you O
while O
you O
are O
alive O
. O

I O
will O
wait O
until O
your O
son O
becomes O
king O
. O

Then O
I O
will O
take O
it O
from O
him O
. O

Still O
, O
I O
will O
not O
tear O
away O
all O
the O
kingdom O
from O
your O
son O
. O

I O
will O
leave O
him O
one O
tribe O
to O
rule O
. O

I O
will O
do O
this O
for O
my O
servant O
David O
and O
for O
Jerusalem O
, O
the O
city O
I O
chose O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
Lord O
raised O
up O
Hadad O
the O
Edomite O
to O
become O
Solomon O
's O
enemy O
. O

Hadad O
was O
from O
the O
royal O
family O
of O
Edom O
. O

This O
is O
how O
it O
happened O
. O

In O
the O
past O
David O
fought O
against O
Edom O
. O

Joab O
was O
the O
commander O
of O
David O
's O
army O
. O

Joab O
went O
to O
Edom O
to O
bury O
his O
dead O
soldiers O
. O

While O
there O
Joab O
killed O
all O
the O
Edomite O
men O
who O
were O
still O
alive O
. O

Joab O
and O
the O
men O
of O
Israel O
stayed O
in O
Edom O
for O
six O
months O
until O
they O
killed O
all O
the O
men O
of O
Edom O
. O

At O
the O
time O
Hadad O
was O
only O
a O
young O
boy O
. O

He O
and O
some O
of O
his O
father O
's O
servants O
ran O
away O
to O
Egypt O
. O

They O
left O
Midian O
and O
went O
to O
Paran O
. O

In O
Paran O
some O
other O
people O
joined O
them O
and O
the O
whole O
group O
went O
to O
Egypt O
. O

They O
went O
to O
Pharaoh O
, O
the O
king O
of O
Egypt O
, O
and O
asked O
for O
help O
. O

Pharaoh O
gave O
Hadad O
a O
house O
, O
some O
land O
, O
and O
food O
to O
eat O
. O

Pharaoh O
liked O
Hadad O
so O
much O
that O
he O
gave O
Hadad O
a O
wife O
. O

She O
was O
Pharaoh O
's O
sister-in-law O
. O

-LRB- O
Pharaoh O
's O
wife O
was O
Queen O
Tahpenes O
. O
-RRB- O

Hadad O
and O
the O
sister O
of O
Tahpenes O
had O
a O
son O
named O
Genubath O
. O

Queen O
Tahpenes O
let O
Genubath O
grow O
up O
in O
Pharaoh O
's O
house O
with O
his O
children O
. O

In O
Egypt O
Hadad O
heard O
that O
David O
had O
died O
and O
that O
Joab O
, O
the O
commander O
of O
the O
army O
, O
was O
dead O
. O

So O
Hadad O
said O
to O
Pharaoh O
, O
`` O
Let O
me O
go O
home O
to O
my O
own O
country O
. O
'' O

But O
Pharaoh O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
have O
given O
you O
everything O
you O
need O
here O
. O

Why O
do O
you O
want O
to O
go O
back O
to O
your O
own O
country O
? O
'' O

Hadad O
answered O
, O
`` O
Please O
, O
just O
let O
me O
go O
home O
. O
'' O

God O
also O
raised O
up O
another O
man O
to O
become O
one O
of O
Solomon O
's O
enemies O
. O

This O
man O
was O
Rezon O
, O
son O
of O
Eliada O
. O

Rezon O
ran O
away O
from O
his O
master O
, O
King O
Hadadezer O
of O
Zobah O
. O

After O
David O
defeated O
the O
army O
of O
Zobah O
, O
Rezon O
gathered O
some O
men O
and O
became O
the O
leader O
of O
a O
small O
army O
. O

He O
went O
to O
Damascus O
and O
stayed O
there O
to O
rule O
from O
Damascus O
. O

Rezon O
became O
the O
king O
of O
Aram O
. O

He O
was O
an O
enemy O
of O
Israel O
throughout O
Solomon O
's O
life O
and O
added O
to O
the O
trouble O
that O
Hadad O
created O
for O
Israel O
. O

There O
was O
also O
another O
person O
who O
became O
an O
enemy O
of O
Solomon O
. O

He O
was O
Jeroboam O
son O
of O
Nebat O
. O

He O
was O
an O
Ephraimite O
from O
the O
town O
of O
Zeredah O
. O

His O
mother O
was O
a O
widow O
named O
Zeruah O
. O

He O
was O
one O
of O
Solomon O
's O
servants O
, O
but O
he O
rebelled O
against O
the O
king O
. O

This O
is O
the O
story O
about O
how O
Jeroboam O
turned O
against O
the O
king O
. O

Solomon O
was O
building O
the O
Millo O
and O
repairing O
the O
wall O
around O
the O
city O
of O
David O
, O
his O
father O
. O

Jeroboam O
was O
a O
free O
man O
. O

Solomon O
saw O
that O
this O
young O
man O
was O
a O
skilled O
worker O
, O
so O
he O
made O
him O
the O
supervisor O
over O
all O
the O
workers O
from O
the O
tribes O
that O
descended O
from O
Joseph O
. O

One O
day O
as O
Jeroboam O
was O
leaving O
Jerusalem O
, O
the O
prophet O
Ahijah O
from O
Shiloh O
met O
him O
on O
the O
road O
. O

They O
were O
alone O
out O
in O
the O
country O
, O
and O
Ahijah O
was O
wearing O
a O
new O
coat O
. O

Ahijah O
took O
his O
new O
coat O
and O
tore O
it O
into O
twelve O
pieces O
. O

Then O
he O
said O
to O
Jeroboam O
, O
`` O
Take O
ten O
pieces O
of O
this O
coat O
for O
yourself O
because O
the O
Lord O
, O
the O
God O
of O
Israel O
, O
says O
: O
' O
I O
will O
tear O
the O
kingdom O
away O
from O
Solomon O
, O
and O
I O
will O
give O
you O
ten O
of O
the O
tribes O
. O

I O
will O
let O
David O
's O
family O
keep O
only O
one O
tribe O
. O

I O
will O
do O
this O
because O
of O
my O
servant O
David O
and O
because O
of O
Jerusalem O
, O
the O
city O
that O
I O
chose O
from O
among O
all O
the O
tribes O
of O
Israel O
. O

I O
will O
take O
the O
kingdom O
from O
Solomon O
because O
he O
stopped O
following O
me O
and O
began O
worshiping O
Ashtoreth O
, O
the O
goddess O
of O
Sidon O
; O
Chemosh O
, O
the O
god O
of O
Moab O
; O
and O
Milcom O
, O
the O
god O
of O
the O
Ammonites O
. O

Solomon O
stopped O
following O
my O
ways O
and O
doing O
what O
I O
say O
is O
right O
. O

He O
does O
not O
obey O
my O
laws O
and O
commands O
as O
his O
father O
David O
did O
. O

So O
I O
will O
take O
the O
kingdom O
away O
from O
Solomon O
's O
family O
. O

I O
chose O
David O
because O
he O
obeyed O
all O
my O
laws O
and O
commands O
. O

So O
for O
my O
servant O
David O
, O
I O
will O
let O
Solomon O
be O
the O
king O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
his O
life O
. O

But O
Jeroboam O
, O
I O
will O
take O
the O
ten O
tribes O
away O
from O
his O
son O
and O
give O
them O
to O
you O
. O

I O
will O
let O
Solomon O
's O
son O
keep O
one O
tribe O
to O
rule O
over O
. O

I O
will O
do O
this O
for O
my O
servant O
David O
, O
so O
he O
will O
always O
have O
someone O
to O
rule O
near O
me O
in O
Jerusalem O
, O
the O
city O
that O
I O
chose O
to O
be O
my O
own O
. O

But O
I O
will O
make O
you O
king O
of O
Israel O
. O

You O
will O
rule O
over O
everything O
you O
want O
. O

If O
you O
live O
right O
and O
obey O
all O
my O
commands O
as O
David O
did O
, O
I O
will O
be O
with O
you O
and O
make O
your O
family O
a O
family O
of O
kings O
, O
just O
as O
I O
did O
for O
David O
. O

And O
you O
will O
have O
Israel O
as O
your O
kingdom O
. O

I O
will O
punish O
David O
's O
descendants O
because O
of O
what O
Solomon O
did O
, O
but O
not O
forever O
. O
' O
'' O

Solomon O
tried O
to O
kill O
Jeroboam O
, O
but O
Jeroboam O
ran O
away O
to O
Egypt O
. O

He O
went O
to O
King O
Shishak O
of O
Egypt O
and O
stayed O
there O
until O
Solomon O
died O
. O

Everything O
else O
Solomon O
did O
, O
from O
the O
beginning O
to O
the O
end O
, O
is O
written O
in O
the O
book O
, O
The O
History O
of O
Solomon O
. O

Solomon O
ruled O
in O
Jerusalem O
over O
all O
Israel O
for O
40 O
years O
. O

Then O
he O
died O
and O
was O
buried O
in O
the O
city O
of O
David O
, O
his O
father O
. O

Then O
Solomon O
's O
son O
, O
Rehoboam O
, O
became O
the O
next O
king O
after O
him O
. O

So O
in O
the O
month O
of O
Ziv O
, O
the O
second O
month O
of O
the O
year O
, O
during O
Solomon O
's O
fourth O
year O
as O
king O
, O
he O
began O
work O
on O
the O
Temple O
. O

This O
was O
480 O
years O
after O
the O
Israelites O
left O
Egypt O
. O

The O
Temple O
was O
60 O
cubits O
long O
, O
20 O
cubits O
wide O
, O
and O
30 O
cubits O
high O
. O

The O
porch O
of O
the O
Temple O
was O
20 O
cubits O
long O
and O
10 O
cubits O
wide O
. O

The O
porch O
ran O
along O
the O
front O
of O
the O
main O
part O
of O
the O
Temple O
itself O
. O

Its O
length O
was O
equal O
to O
the O
width O
of O
the O
Temple O
. O

There O
were O
narrow O
windows O
in O
the O
Temple O
. O

These O
windows O
were O
smaller O
on O
the O
inside O
of O
the O
wall O
than O
on O
the O
outside O
. O

Then O
Solomon O
built O
a O
row O
of O
rooms O
around O
the O
main O
part O
of O
the O
Temple O
. O

This O
row O
of O
rooms O
was O
three O
stories O
tall O
with O
the O
rooms O
built O
one O
above O
the O
other O
. O

The O
rooms O
touched O
the O
Temple O
wall O
, O
but O
their O
beams O
were O
not O
built O
into O
that O
wall O
. O

The O
Temple O
wall O
became O
thinner O
at O
the O
top O
, O
so O
the O
rooms O
on O
the O
upper O
floors O
were O
larger O
than O
the O
ones O
below O
them O
. O

The O
rooms O
on O
the O
bottom O
floor O
were O
5 O
cubits O
wide O
. O

The O
rooms O
on O
the O
middle O
floor O
were O
6 O
cubits O
wide O
. O

The O
rooms O
above O
that O
were O
7 O
cubits O
wide O
. O

The O
stones O
were O
completely O
finished O
before O
they O
were O
brought O
into O
the O
Temple O
area O
, O
so O
there O
was O
no O
noise O
of O
hammers O
, O
axes O
, O
or O
any O
other O
iron O
tools O
in O
the O
Temple O
. O

The O
entrance O
to O
these O
rooms O
was O
on O
bottom O
floor O
at O
the O
south O
side O
of O
the O
Temple O
. O

Inside O
there O
were O
stairs O
that O
went O
up O
to O
the O
second O
floor O
and O
from O
there O
to O
the O
third O
floor O
. O

Solomon O
finished O
building O
the O
main O
part O
of O
the O
Temple O
and O
then O
covered O
it O
inside O
with O
cedar O
boards O
. O

Then O
he O
finished O
building O
the O
rooms O
around O
the O
Temple O
. O

Each O
story O
was O
5 O
cubits O
tall O
. O

The O
cedar O
beams O
in O
these O
rooms O
rested O
on O
a O
ledge O
of O
the O
Temple O
wall O
. O

The O
Lord O
said O
to O
Solomon O
, O
`` O
If O
you O
obey O
all O
my O
laws O
and O
commands O
, O
I O
will O
do O
for O
you O
what O
I O
promised O
your O
father O
David O
. O

I O
will O
live O
among O
the O
children O
of O
Israel O
in O
this O
Temple O
that O
you O
are O
building O
, O
and O
I O
will O
never O
leave O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
. O
'' O

When O
Solomon O
finished O
the O
stonework O
on O
the O
Temple O
, O
the O
stone O
walls O
inside O
the O
Temple O
were O
covered O
with O
cedar O
boards O
from O
floor O
to O
ceiling O
. O

Then O
the O
stone O
floor O
was O
covered O
with O
pine O
boards O
. O

They O
built O
an O
inner O
room O
20 O
cubits O
long O
in O
the O
back O
part O
of O
the O
Temple O
. O

This O
room O
was O
called O
the O
Most O
Holy O
Place O

They O
covered O
the O
walls O
in O
this O
room O

In O

This O

was O
40 O
cubits O

. O

They O
covered O
the O
walls O
in O
this O
room O
with O
cedar O
boards O
-- O
none O
of O
the O
stones O
in O
the O
walls O
could O
be O
seen O
. O

They O
carved O
pictures O
of O
flowers O
and O
gourds O
into O
the O
cedar O
. O

Solomon O
finished O
the O
inner O
room O
in O
the O
back O
part O
of O
the O
Temple O
. O

This O
room O
was O
for O
the O

was O
20 O
cubits O

, O
20 O
cubits O
wide O
, O
and O
20 O
cubits O
high O
. O

Solomon O
covered O
this O
room O
with O
pure O
gold O
. O

He O
also O
covered O
the O
cedar O
altar O
with O
gold O
. O

He O
covered O
the O
inside O
of O
the O
Temple O
with O
pure O

and O
wrapped O

around O

and O
the O
altar O
in O

of O
the O
Most O

The O
workers O
made O
two O
statues O
of O
Cherub O
angels O
with O
wings O
. O

They O
made O
the O
statues O
from O
olive O
wood O
and O
put O
them O
in O
the O
Most O
Holy O
Place O
. O

Each O
angel O
was O
10 O

Both O
Cherub O
angels O
were O

Each O

Their O

The O

The O

They O
put O

They O
also O
made O

to O
the O

They O
used O

There O

the O
eighth O
month O
of O
the O
year O
, O
in O
Solomon O
's O
eleventh O
year O
as O
king O
. O

It O
took O
seven O
years O
to O
build O
the O
Temple O
. O

It O
was O
built O
exactly O
as O
planned O
. O

The O
Lord O
commanded O
a O
man O
of O
God O
from O
Judah O
to O
go O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Bethel O
. O

King O
Jeroboam O
was O
standing O
at O
the O
altar O
offering O
incense O
when O
the O
man O
of O
God O
arrived O
. O

The O
Lord O
had O
commanded O
the O
man O
of O
God O
to O
speak O
against O
the O
altar O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Altar O
, O
the O
Lord O
says O
to O
you O
: O
' O
David O
's O
family O
will O
have O
a O
son O
. O

His O
name O
will O
be O
Josiah O
. O

The O
priests O
of O
the O
high O
places O
are O
now O
burning O
incense O
on O
you O
, O
but O
Josiah O
will O
offer O
the O
priests O
on O
you O
and O
burn O
human O
bones O
on O
you O
, O
so O
you O
can O
never O
be O
used O
again O
! O
' O
'' O

The O
man O
of O
God O
gave O
proof O
to O
the O
people O
that O
this O
would O
happen O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
This O
is O
the O
proof O
that O
the O
Lord O
told O
me O
about O
. O

He O
said O
, O
' O
This O
altar O
will O
break O
apart O
, O
and O
the O
ashes O
on O
it O
will O
fall O
onto O
the O
ground O
. O
' O
'' O

When O
King O
Jeroboam O
heard O
the O
message O
from O
the O
man O
of O
God O
about O
the O
altar O
in O
Bethel O
, O
he O
took O
his O
hand O
off O
the O
altar O
and O
pointed O
at O
the O
man O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Arrest O
that O
man O
! O
'' O

But O
when O
the O
king O
said O
this O
, O
his O
arm O
became O
paralyzed O
. O

He O
could O
not O
move O
it O
. O

Then O
the O
altar O
broke O
into O
pieces O
, O
and O
all O
its O
ashes O
fell O
onto O
the O
ground O
. O

This O
proved O
that O
what O
the O
man O
of O
God O
had O
said O
came O
from O
God O
. O

Then O
King O
Jeroboam O
said O
to O
the O
man O
of O
God O
, O
`` O
Please O
pray O
to O
the O
Lord O
your O
God O
for O
me O
. O

Ask O
him O
to O
heal O
my O
arm O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
man O
of O
God O
prayed O
to O
the O
Lord O
, O
and O
the O
king O
's O
arm O
was O
healed O
, O
as O
it O
was O
before O
. O

Then O
the O
king O
said O
to O
the O
man O
of O
God O
, O
`` O
Please O
come O
home O
with O
me O
. O

Come O
and O
eat O
with O
me O
. O

I O
will O
give O
you O
a O
gift O
. O
'' O

But O
the O
man O
of O
God O
said O
to O
the O
king O
, O
`` O
I O
will O
not O
go O
home O
with O
you O
, O
even O
if O
you O
give O
me O
half O
of O
your O
kingdom O
! O

I O
will O
not O
eat O
or O
drink O
anything O
in O
this O
place O
. O

The O
Lord O
commanded O
me O
not O
to O
eat O
or O
drink O
anything O
here O
. O

He O
also O
commanded O
me O
not O
to O
go O
back O
the O
same O
way O
I O
came O
. O
'' O

So O
he O
took O
a O
different O
road O
home O
. O

He O
did O
not O
go O
back O
the O
same O
way O
he O
came O
to O
Bethel O
. O

There O
was O
an O
old O
prophet O
living O
in O
Bethel O
. O

His O
sons O
came O
and O
told O
him O
what O
the O
man O
of O
God O
did O
in O
Bethel O
and O
what O
he O
said O
to O
King O
Jeroboam O
. O

The O
old O
prophet O
said O
, O
`` O
Which O
way O
did O
he O
go O
when O
he O
left O
? O
'' O

So O
the O
sons O
showed O
their O
father O
which O
road O
the O
man O
of O
God O
from O
Judah O
had O
taken O
. O

The O
old O
prophet O
told O
his O
sons O
to O
saddle O
his O
donkey O
. O

They O
put O
the O
saddle O
on O
the O
donkey O
, O
and O
the O
prophet O
left O
. O

The O
old O
prophet O
went O
after O
the O
man O
of O
God O
. O

He O
found O
him O
sitting O
under O
an O
oak O
tree O
and O
asked O
him O
, O
`` O
Are O
you O
the O
man O
of O
God O
who O
just O
came O
from O
Judah O
? O
'' O

The O
man O
of O
God O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
I O
am O

'' O

So O
the O
old O
prophet O
said O
, O
`` O
Please O
come O
home O
and O
eat O
with O
me O

'' O

But O
the O
man O
of O
God O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
can O
not O

with O
you O

I O
can O
not O
eat O
or O
drink O
anything O
in O
this O
place O

The O
Lord O
said O
to O
me O
, O
' O
You O
must O
not O
eat O
or O
drink O
anything O
in O
that O
place O

and O
you O
must O
go O
back O
on O
a O
different O
road O

' O
'' O

The O
old O
prophet O
lied O
to O
him O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
But O
I O
am O
a O
prophet O
like O
you O

And O
an O
angel O
from O
the O
Lord O
came O
to O
me O
and O
told O
me O
to O
bring O
you O
home O
and O
give O
you O
something O
to O
eat O
and O
drink O

'' O

So O
the O
man O
of O
God O
went O
to O
the O
old O
prophet O
's O
house O
and O
ate O
and O
drank O
with O
him O
. O

While O
they O
were O
sitting O
at O
the O
table O
, O
the O
Lord O
spoke O
to O
the O
old O
prophet O
, O
and O
the O
old O
prophet O
spoke O
to O
the O
man O
of O
God O
from O
Judah O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
Lord O
said O
that O
you O

not O
obey O
him O

You O
did O
not O
do O
what O

The O
Lord O
commanded O
you O
not O
to O

anything O
in O
this O
place O
, O
but O
you O
came O
back O
here O
and O
ate O
and O
drank O
. O

So O
your O
body O
will O
not O
be O
buried O
in O
your O
family O
grave O
. O
'' O

The O
man O
of O
God O
finished O
eating O
and O
drinking O
. O

Then O
the O
old O
prophet O
saddled O
the O
man O
's O
donkey O
for O
him O
and O
the O
man O
left O
. O

On O
the O
way O
home O
, O
a O
lion O
attacked O
and O
killed O
the O
man O
of O
God O
. O

His O
body O
was O
lying O
on O
the O
road O
while O
the O
lion O
stood O
next O
to O
it O
. O

The O
donkey O
stood O
nearby O
. O

Some O
people O
came O
walking O
by O
and O
saw O
the O
body O
and O
the O
lion O
standing O
by O
it O
. O

They O
went O
into O
the O
city O
where O
the O
old O
prophet O
lived O
and O
told O
people O
what O
they O
had O
seen O
on O
the O
road O
. O

The O
old O
prophet O
heard O
the O
story O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
This O
is O
the O
man O
of O
God O
who O
did O
not O
obey O
the O
Lord O
's O
command O
, O
so O
the O
Lord O
sent O
a O
lion O
to O
kill O
him O
, O
just O
as O
he O
said O
he O
would O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
prophet O
told O
his O
sons O
to O
saddle O
his O
donkey O
, O
and O
they O
did O
so O
. O

The O
old O
prophet O
went O
to O
find O
the O
body O
lying O
on O
the O
road O
. O

The O
donkey O
and O
the O
lion O
were O
still O
standing O
near O
it O
. O

The O
lion O
had O
not O
eaten O
the O
body O
or O
hurt O
the O
donkey O
. O

The O
old O
prophet O
put O
the O
body O
on O
his O
donkey O
and O
carried O
it O
back O
to O
the O
city O
to O
cry O
for O
him O
and O
bury O
him O
. O

The O
old O
prophet O
buried O
the O
man O
in O
his O
own O
family O
grave O
. O

The O
old O
prophet O
cried O
for O
him O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Oh O
, O
my O
brother O
, O
I O
am O
sorry O
for O
you O

'' O

So O
the O
old O
prophet O
buried O
the O
body O

Then O
he O
said O
to O
his O
sons O
, O
`` O
When O
I O
die O
, O
bury O
me O
in O
this O
same O
grave O

Put O
my O
bones O
next O
to O
his O
. O

What O
the O
Lord O
spoke O
through O
him O
will O
certainly O
come O
true O
. O

The O
Lord O
used O
him O
to O
speak O
against O
the O
altar O
at O
Bethel O
and O
against O
the O
high O
places O
in O
the O
other O
towns O
in O
Samaria O
. O
'' O

King O
Jeroboam O
did O
not O
change O
. O

He O
continued O
doing O
evil O
. O

He O
continued O
to O
choose O
people O
from O
different O
tribes O
to O
serve O
as O
priests O
at O
the O
high O
places O
. O

Whoever O
wanted O
to O
be O
a O
priest O
was O
allowed O
to O
be O
one O
. O

This O
is O
the O
sin O
that O
caused O
the O
ruin O
and O
destruction O
of O
his O
kingdom O
. O

For O
the O
next O
two O
years O
there O
was O
peace O
between O
Israel O
and O
Aram O
. O

Then O
during O
the O
third O
year O
, O
King O
Jehoshaphat O
of O
Judah O
went O
to O
visit O
King O
Ahab O
of O
Israel O
. O

Ahab O
asked O
his O
officials O
, O
`` O
Remember O
when O
the O
king O
of O
Aram O
took O
Ramoth O
Gilead O
from O
us O
? O

That O
city O
is O
ours O
, O
so O
why O
have O
we O
done O
nothing O
to O
get O
it O
back O
? O
'' O

So O
Ahab O
asked O
King O
Jehoshaphat O
, O
`` O
Will O
you O
join O
with O
us O
to O
go O
fight O
the O
Arameans O
at O
Ramoth O
Gilead O
? O
'' O

Jehoshaphat O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
you O
and O
I O
will O
be O
as O
one O
-- O
my O
men O
and O
my O
horses O
will O
be O
as O
yours O
. O

But O
first O
let O
's O
ask O
the O
Lord O
for O
advice O
. O
'' O

So O
Ahab O
called O
a O
meeting O
of O
the O
prophets O
. O

There O
were O
about O
400 O
prophets O
at O
that O
time O
. O

Ahab O
asked O
the O
prophets O
, O
`` O
Should O
I O
go O
and O
attack O
the O
Arameans O
at O
Ramoth O
Gilead O
or O
not O
? O
'' O

The O
prophets O
answered O
Ahab O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
because O
the O
Lord O
will O
let O
you O
defeat O
Ramoth O
Gilead O
. O
'' O

But O
Jehoshaphat O
said O
, O
`` O
Does O
n't O
the O
Lord O
have O
another O
prophet O
here O
? O

Let O
's O
ask O
him O
what O
God O
says O
. O
'' O

King O
Ahab O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
there O
is O
another O
prophet O
. O

His O
name O
is O
Micaiah O
son O
of O
Imlah O
. O

But O
I O
hate O
him O
because O
he O
will O
not O
say O
anything O
good O
about O
me O
when O
he O
speaks O
for O
the O
Lord O
. O

He O
always O
says O
things O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
. O
'' O

Jehoshaphat O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
king O
should O
not O
say O
that O
! O
'' O

So O
King O
Ahab O
told O
one O
of O
his O
officers O
to O
go O
and O
find O
Micaiah O
. O

At O
that O
time O
the O
two O
kings O
were O
sitting O
on O
their O
thrones O
, O
with O
their O
royal O
robes O
on O
, O
at O
the O
judgment O
place O
near O
the O
gates O
of O
Samaria O
. O

All O
the O
prophets O
were O
standing O
before O
them O
, O
prophesying O
. O

One O
of O
the O
prophets O
was O
named O
Zedekiah O
son O
of O
Kenaanah O
. O

Zedekiah O
made O
some O
iron O
horns O
and O
said O
to O
Ahab O
, O
`` O
The O
Lord O
says O
, O
' O
You O
will O
use O
these O
iron O
horns O
to O
fight O
against O
the O
army O
of O
Aram O
. O

You O
will O
defeat O
them O
and O
destroy O
them O
. O
' O
'' O

All O
the O
other O
prophets O
agreed O
with O
Zedekiah O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Your O
army O
should O
march O
now O
to O
go O
fight O
against O
the O
Arameans O
at O
Ramoth O
Gilead O
. O

You O
will O
win O
the O
battle O
. O

The O
Lord O
will O
let O
you O
defeat O
them O
. O
'' O

While O
this O
was O
happening O
, O
the O
officer O
went O
to O
find O
Micaiah O
. O

When O
he O
found O
him O
, O
the O
officer O
told O
him O
, O
`` O
All O
the O
other O
prophets O
have O
said O
that O
the O
king O
will O
succeed O
, O
so O
you O
should O
say O
the O
same O
thing O
. O
'' O

But O
Micaiah O
answered O
, O
`` O
As O
surely O
as O
the O
Lord O
lives O
, O
I O
can O
say O
only O
what O
the O
Lord O
says O
. O
'' O

Micaiah O
went O
and O
stood O
before O
King O
Ahab O
. O

The O
king O
asked O
him O
, O
`` O
Micaiah O
, O
should O
we O
go O
and O
attack O
the O
Arameans O
at O
Ramoth O
Gilead O
or O
not O
? O
'' O

Micaiah O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
go O
and O
be O
successful O
! O

The O
Lord O
will O
let O
you O
take O
the O
city O
. O
'' O

But O
Ahab O
answered O
, O
`` O
How O
many O
times O
do O
I O
have O
to O
tell O
you O
? O

Tell O
me O
the O
truth O
. O

What O
does O
the O
Lord O
say O
? O
'' O

So O
Micaiah O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
can O
see O
the O
army O
of O
Israel O
scattered O
all O
over O
the O
hills O
, O
like O
sheep O
with O
no O
one O
to O
lead O
them O
. O

This O
is O
what O
the O
Lord O
says O
, O
' O
These O
men O
have O
no O
leaders O
. O

Let O
them O
go O
home O
in O
peace O

'' O

Then O
Ahab O
said O
to O
Jehoshaphat O
, O
`` O
See O
, O
I O
told O
you O
! O

This O
prophet O
never O
says O
anything O
good O
about O
me O
. O

He O
always O
says O
something O
bad O
. O
'' O

But O
Micaiah O
said O
, O
`` O
Listen O
to O
this O
message O
from O
the O
Lord O
: O
I O
saw O
the O
Lord O
sitting O
on O
his O
throne O
. O

All O
of O
heaven O
's O
army O
was O
standing O
around O
him O
, O
some O
on O
his O
left O
side O
and O
some O
on O
his O
right O
side O
. O

The O
Lord O
said O
, O
' O
Which O
of O
you O
will O
go O
fool O
Ahab O
into O
attacking O
the O
Arameans O
at O
Ramoth O
Gilead O
so O
that O
he O
will O
be O
killed O
? O
' O

The O
angels O
discussed O
many O
different O
plans O
. O

Then O
a O
spirit O
went O
and O
stood O
before O
the O
Lord O
and O
said O
, O
' O
I O
will O
fool O
him O
! O
' O

The O
Lord O
asked O
, O
' O
How O
will O
you O
do O
it O
? O
' O

The O
angel O
answered O
, O
' O
I O
will O
go O
out O
and O
become O
a O
spirit O
of O
lies O
in O
the O
mouths O
of O
Ahab O
's O
prophets O
-- O
they O
will O
all O
speak O
lies O

' O

So O
the O
Lord O
said O
, O
' O
Yes O
, O
that O
will O
fool O
Ahab O
. O

Go O
out O
and O
do O
that O

' O

`` O
So O
that O
is O
what O
has O
happened O
here O
. O

The O
Lord O
made O
your O
prophets O
lie O
to O
you O
. O

The O
Lord O
himself O
decided O
to O
bring O
this O
disaster O
to O
you O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
prophet O
Zedekiah O
went O
to O
Micaiah O
and O
hit O
him O
on O
the O
face O
. O

Zedekiah O
said O
, O
`` O
How O
is O
it O
that O
the O
Spirit O
of O
the O
Lord O
left O
me O
to O
speak O
through O
you O
? O
'' O

Micaiah O
answered O
, O
`` O
Look O
, O
what O
I O
said O
will O
happen O
! O

And O
you O
will O
see O
it O
one O
day O
when O
you O
are O
in O
a O
secret O
room O
somewhere O
hiding O
. O
'' O

Then O
King O
Ahab O
ordered O
one O
of O
his O
officers O
to O
arrest O
Micaiah O
. O

Ahab O
said O
, O
`` O
Arrest O
him O
and O
take O
him O
to O
Amon O
the O
governor O
of O
the O
city O
and O
prince O
Joash O
. O

Tell O
them O
to O
put O
Micaiah O
in O
prison O
. O

Give O
him O
nothing O
but O
bread O
and O
water O
to O
eat O
. O

Keep O
him O
there O
until O
I O
come O
home O
from O
the O
battle O
. O
'' O

Micaiah O
said O
, O
`` O
Listen O
to O
me O
, O
everyone O
! O

Ahab O
, O
if O
you O
come O
back O
alive O
from O
the O
battle O
, O
the O
Lord O
has O
not O
spoken O
through O
me O
. O
'' O

King O
Ahab O
of O
Israel O
and O
King O
Jehoshaphat O
of O
Judah O
went O
to O
fight O
the O
Arameans O
at O
Ramoth O
Gilead O
. O

Ahab O
said O
to O
Jehoshaphat O
, O
`` O
Disguise O
yourself O
when O
you O
go O
into O
battle O
, O
but O
wear O
your O
own O
clothes O
. O

And O
I O
will O
disguise O
myself O
. O
'' O

The O
king O
of O
Israel O
went O
into O
battle O
dressed O
like O
an O
ordinary O
soldier O
. O

The O
king O
of O
Aram O
had O
32 O
chariot O
commanders O
. O

He O
gave O
them O
this O
command O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
go O
after O
anyone O
except O
the O
king O
of O
Israel O
, O
no O
matter O
how O
important O
they O
are O
. O
'' O

When O
the O
commanders O
saw O
King O
Jehoshaphat O
, O
they O
thought O
he O
was O
the O
king O
of O
Israel O
, O
and O
so O
they O
went O
to O
kill O
him O
. O

Jehoshaphat O
started O
shouting O
. O

When O
the O
commanders O
saw O
that O
he O
was O
not O
King O
Ahab O
, O
they O
stopped O
chasing O
him O
. O

Then O
a O
soldier O
in O
the O
distance O
pulled O
back O
as O
far O
as O
he O
could O
on O
his O
bow O
and O
shot O
an O
arrow O
into O
the O
air O
. O

The O
arrow O
happened O
to O
hit O
the O
king O
of O
Israel O
in O
a O
small O
hole O
where O
his O
armor O
was O
fastened O
together O
. O

King O
Ahab O
said O
to O
his O
chariot O
driver O
, O
`` O
I O
've O
been O
hit O
! O

Turn O
the O
chariot O
around O
and O
take O
me O
off O
the O
battlefield O
! O
'' O

The O
armies O
continued O
to O
fight O
while O
King O
Ahab O
was O
propped O
up O
in O
his O
chariot O
. O

He O
was O
leaning O
against O
the O
sides O
of O
the O
chariot O
, O
looking O
out O
toward O
the O
Arameans O
. O

His O
blood O
ran O
down O
onto O
the O
floor O
of O
the O
chariot O
. O

Later O
in O
the O
evening O
, O
he O
died O
. O

At O
sunset O
all O
the O
Israelites O
cheered O
when O
they O
were O
told O
to O
go O
home O
. O

So O
they O
all O
went O
back O
to O
their O
hometowns O
. O

And O
that O
is O
how O
King O
Ahab O
died O
. O

Some O
men O
carried O
his O
body O
to O
Samaria O
and O
buried O
him O
there O
. O

They O
took O
his O
chariot O
to O
the O
large O
pool O
in O
Samaria O
to O
clean O
it O
. O

The O
dogs O
licked O
up O
Ahab O
's O
blood O
while O
the O
prostitutes O
washed O
the O
chariot O
. O

This O
happened O
just O
as O
the O
Lord O
said O
it O
would O
. O

The O
rest O
of O
what O
King O
Ahab O
did O
during O
the O
time O
he O
ruled O
is O
written O
in O
the O
book O
, O
The O
History O
of O
the O
Kings O
of O
Israel O
. O

That O
book O
tells O
about O
all O
the O
cities O
he O
built O
and O
about O
all O
the O
ivory O
that O
he O
used O
to O
decorate O
his O
palace O
. O

Ahab O
died O
and O
was O
buried O
with O
his O
ancestors O
. O

His O
son O
Ahaziah O
became O
the O
next O
king O
after O
him O
. O

Jehoshaphat O
son O
of O
Asa O
became O
the O
king O
of O
Judah O
in O
Ahab O
's O
fourth O
year O
as O
king O
of O
Israel O
. O

Jehoshaphat O
was O
35 O
years O
old O
when O
he O
became O
king O
, O
and O
he O
ruled O
in O
Jerusalem O
for O
25 O
years O
. O

His O
mother O
was O
Azubah O
, O
the O
daughter O
of O
Shilhi O
. O

Like O
his O
father O
Asa O
, O
Jehoshaphat O
was O
good O
and O
did O
everything O
that O
the O
Lord O
wanted O
, O
but O
he O
did O
not O
destroy O
the O
high O
places O
. O

The O
people O
continued O
offering O
sacrifices O
and O
burning O
incense O
there O
. O

Jehoshaphat O
made O
a O
peace O
agreement O
with O
the O
king O
of O
Israel O
. O

Jehoshaphat O
was O
very O
brave O
and O
fought O
many O
wars O
. O

The O
rest O
of O
what O
he O
did O
is O
written O
in O
the O
book O
, O
The O
History O
of O
the O
Kings O
of O
Judah O
. O

Jehoshaphat O
forced O
all O
the O
men O
and O
women O
who O
sold O
their O
bodies O
for O
sex O
to O
leave O
the O
places O
of O
worship O
. O

They O
had O
served O
in O
these O
places O
of O
worship O
while O
his O
father O
Asa O
was O
king O
. O

In O
those O
days O
Edom O
did O
not O
have O
a O
king O
; O
it O
was O
ruled O
by O
a O
governor O
who O
was O
chosen O
by O
the O
king O
of O
Judah O
. O

King O
Jehoshaphat O
built O
some O
cargo O
ships O
. O

He O
wanted O
the O
ships O
to O
sail O
to O
Ophir O
for O
gold O
, O
but O
they O
never O
went O
there O
-- O
they O
were O
destroyed O
in O
their O
home O
port O
at O
Ezion O
Geber O
. O

Then O
King O
Ahaziah O
of O
Israel O
offered O
to O
put O
some O
of O
his O
own O
sailors O
with O
Jehoshaphat O
's O
men O
on O
the O
ships O
, O
but O
Jehoshaphat O
refused O
to O
accept O
his O
help O
. O

Jehoshaphat O
died O
and O
was O
buried O
with O
his O
ancestors O
in O
the O
City O
of O
David O
. O

Then O
his O
son O
Jehoram O
became O
the O
next O
king O
. O

Ahaziah O
was O
the O
son O
of O
Ahab O
. O

He O
became O
king O
of O
Israel O
during O
the O
17th O
year O
that O
King O
Jehoshaphat O
ruled O
Judah O
. O

Ahaziah O
ruled O
in O
Samaria O
for O
two O
years O
. O

He O
sinned O
against O
the O
Lord O
just O
as O
his O
parents O
, O
Ahab O
and O
Jezebel O
, O
did O
. O

He O
caused O
Israel O
to O
sin O
just O
as O
Jeroboam O
son O
of O
Nabat O
did O
. O

Ahaziah O
served O
the O
false O
god O
Baal O
and O
worshiped O
him O
, O
just O
as O
his O
father O
did O
before O
him O
. O

He O
did O
all O
the O
things O
that O
his O
father O
did O
to O
make O
the O
Lord O
, O
the O
God O
of O
Israel O
, O
angry O
. O

At O
that O
time O
Jeroboam O
's O
son O
Abijah O
became O
very O
sick O
. O

Jeroboam O
said O
to O
his O
wife O
, O
`` O
Go O
to O
Shiloh O
and O
see O
the O
prophet O
Ahijah O
. O

He O
is O
the O
one O
who O
said O
that O
I O
would O
become O
king O
of O
Israel O
. O

Dress O
yourself O
so O
that O
people O
will O
not O
know O
that O
you O
are O
my O
wife O
. O

Give O
the O
prophet O
ten O
loaves O
of O
bread O
, O
some O
cakes O
, O
and O
a O
jar O
of O
honey O
. O

Then O
ask O
him O
what O
will O
happen O
to O
our O
son O
, O
and O
he O
will O
tell O
you O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
king O
's O
wife O
did O
what O
he O
said O
. O

She O
went O
to O
the O
home O
of O
Ahijah O
the O
prophet O
in O
Shiloh O
. O

Ahijah O
was O
very O
old O
and O
had O
become O
blind O
. O

But O
the O
Lord O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Jeroboam O
's O
wife O
is O
coming O
to O
ask O
you O
about O
her O
son O
. O

He O
is O
sick O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
Lord O
told O
Ahijah O
what O
he O
should O
say O
. O

Jeroboam O
's O
wife O
came O
to O
Ahijah O
's O
house O
. O

She O
was O
trying O
not O
to O
let O
people O
know O
who O
she O
was O
. O

Ahijah O
heard O
her O
coming O
to O
the O
door O
. O

So O
he O
said O
, O
`` O
Come O
in O
, O
Jeroboam O
's O
wife O
. O

Why O
are O
you O
trying O
to O
make O
people O
think O
you O
are O
someone O
else O
? O

I O
have O
some O
bad O
news O
for O
you O
. O

Go O
back O
and O
tell O
Jeroboam O
that O
this O
is O
what O
the O
Lord O
, O
the O
God O
of O
Israel O
, O
says O
: O
' O
Jeroboam O
, O
I O
chose O
you O
from O
among O
all O
the O
Israelites O
. O

I O
made O
you O
the O
ruler O
of O
my O
people O
. O

David O
's O
family O
was O
ruling O
the O
kingdom O
of O
Israel O
, O
but O
I O
took O
the O
kingdom O
away O
from O
them O
and O
gave O
it O
to O
you O
. O

But O
you O
are O
not O
like O
my O
servant O
David O
. O

He O
always O
obeyed O
my O
commands O
and O
followed O
me O
with O
his O
whole O
heart O
. O

He O
did O
only O
what O
I O
accepted O
. O

But O
you O
have O
sinned O
worse O
than O
anyone O
who O
ruled O
before O
you O
. O

You O
stopped O
following O
me O
and O
made O
other O
gods O
for O
yourself O
. O

You O
made O
those O
statues O
to O
make O
me O
angry O
. O

So O
Jeroboam O
, O
I O
will O
bring O
troubles O
to O
your O
family O
. O

I O
will O
kill O
all O
the O
men O
in O
your O
family O
. O

I O
will O
destroy O
your O
family O
completely O
, O
like O
fire O
burning O
up O
dung O
. O

Anyone O
from O
your O
family O
who O
dies O
in O
the O
city O
will O
be O
eaten O
by O
dogs O
. O

And O
anyone O
from O
your O
family O
who O
dies O
in O
the O
fields O
will O
be O
eaten O
by O
birds O
. O

The O
Lord O
has O
spoken O
. O
' O
'' O

Then O
Ahijah O
said O
, O
`` O
Now O
, O
go O
home O
. O

Your O
son O
will O
die O
as O
soon O
as O
your O
enter O
the O
city O
. O

All O
Israel O
will O
cry O
for O
him O
. O

They O
will O
bury O
him O
, O
but O
he O
is O
the O
only O
one O
from O
Jeroboam O
's O
family O
who O
will O
be O
buried O
. O

This O
is O
because O
he O
is O
the O
only O
one O
in O
Jeroboam O
's O
family O
who O
pleased O
the O
Lord O
, O
the O
God O
of O
Israel O
. O

Soon O
, O
the O
Lord O
will O
put O
a O
new O
king O
over O
Israel O
who O
will O
destroy O
Jeroboam O
's O
family O
. O

Then O
the O
Lord O
will O
punish O
Israel O
. O

The O
Israelites O
will O
be O
so O
full O
of O
fear O
that O
they O
will O
shake O
like O
tall O
grass O
in O
the O
water O
. O

He O
will O
pull O
Israel O
up O
from O
this O
good O
land O
that O
he O
gave O
their O
ancestors O
. O

He O
will O
scatter O
them O
to O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
Euphrates O
River O
. O

The O
Lord O
will O
do O
this O
because O
the O
people O
made O
him O
angry O
when O
they O
built O
sacred O
poles O
. O

Jeroboam O
sinned O
, O
and O
then O
he O
made O
the O
Israelites O
sin O
. O

So O
the O
Lord O
will O
let O
the O
Israelites O
be O
defeated O
. O
'' O

Jeroboam O
's O
wife O
went O
back O
to O
Tirzah O

As O
soon O
as O
she O
stepped O
into O
the O
house O
, O
the O
boy O
died O

All O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
buried O
him O
and O
cried O
for O
him O

This O
happened O
just O

the O
Lord O
said O
it O
would O
through O
his O
servant O

The O

the O
way O
he O
ruled O

Jeroboam O
ruled O
as O
king O
for O
22 O
years O

Then O
he O
died O

was O
buried O
with O
his O

His O
son O
Nadab O
became O
the O
new O
king O
after O
him O

Solomon O
's O
son O
, O
Rehoboam O
, O
was O
41 O
years O
old O
when O
he O
became O
king O
of O
Judah O
. O

Rehoboam O
ruled O
17 O
years O
in O
Jerusalem O
, O
the O
city O
the O
Lord O
chose O
for O
his O
own O
. O

He O
chose O
this O
city O
from O
all O
the O
other O
tribes O
of O
Israel O
. O

Rehoboam O
's O
mother O
was O
Naamah O
. O

She O
was O
an O
Ammonite O
. O

The O
people O
of O
Judah O
also O
sinned O
and O
did O
what O
that O
the O
Lord O
said O
was O
wrong O
. O

They O
made O
the O
Lord O
angry O
. O

They O
were O
worse O
than O
their O
fathers O
who O
lived O
before O
them O
. O

They O
built O
high O
places O
, O
memorial O
stones O
, O
and O
sacred O
poles O
. O

They O
built O
them O
on O
every O
high O
hill O
and O
under O
every O
green O
tree O
. O

There O
were O
also O
men O
who O
served O
other O
gods O
by O
selling O
their O
bodies O
for O
sex O

So O
the O
people O
of O
Judah O
were O
worse O
than O
the O
people O
who O
had O
lived O
in O
the O
land O
before O
them O
. O

And O
the O
Lord O
took O
the O
land O
away O
from O
those O
people O
to O
give O
it O
to O
the O
Israelites O
. O

In O
the O
fifth O
year O
that O
Rehoboam O
was O
king O
, O
King O
Shishak O
of O
Egypt O
came O
to O
attack O
Jerusalem O

He O
took O
the O
treasures O
from O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
and O
from O
the O
king O
's O
palace O
. O

He O
even O
took O
the O
gold O
shields O
that O
David O
had O
taken O
from O
the O
officers O
of O
King O
Hadadezer O
of O
Aram O
and O
put O
on O
the O
walls O
of O
Jerusalem O

King O
Rehoboam O
made O
more O
shields O
to O
put O
in O
their O
places O
, O
but O
they O
were O
made O
from O
bronze O
. O

He O
gave O
them O
to O
the O
guards O
on O
duty O
at O
the O
palace O
gates O

Every O
time O
the O
king O
went O
to O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
, O
the O
guards O
took O
out O
the O
shields O
and O
went O
with O
him O
. O

After O
they O
were O
finished O

they O
put O
the O
shields O

after O
him O
. O

There O
was O
a O
vineyard O
near O
King O
Ahab O
's O
palace O
in O
Samaria O
. O

A O
man O
from O
Jezreel O
named O
Naboth O
owned O
it O
. O

One O
day O
Ahab O
said O
to O
Naboth O
, O
`` O
Give O
me O
your O
vineyard O
that O
is O
near O
my O
palace O
. O

I O
want O
to O
make O
it O
a O
vegetable O
garden O
. O

I O
will O
give O
you O
a O
better O
vineyard O
in O
its O
place O
. O

Or O
, O
if O
you O
prefer O
, O
I O
will O
pay O
you O
for O
it O
. O
'' O

Naboth O
answered O
, O
`` O
By O
the O
Lord O
, O
I O
will O
never O
give O
my O
land O
to O
you O
. O

This O
land O
belongs O
to O
my O
family O
. O
'' O

So O
Ahab O
went O
home O
angry O
and O
upset O
because O
Naboth O
told O
him O
, O
`` O
I O
will O
not O
give O
you O
my O
family O
's O
land O
. O
'' O

Ahab O
went O
to O
bed O
, O
turned O
away O
from O
everyone O
, O
and O
refused O
to O
eat O
. O

His O
wife O
Jezebel O
went O
to O
him O
and O
asked O
him O
, O
`` O
Why O
are O
you O
upset O
? O

Why O
do O
you O
refuse O
to O
eat O
? O
'' O

Ahab O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
asked O
Naboth O
from O
Jezreel O
to O
give O
me O
his O
vineyard O
. O

I O
told O
him O
that O
I O
would O
pay O
him O
the O
full O
price O
. O

Or O
, O
if O
he O
preferred O
, O
I O
would O
give O
him O
another O
vineyard O
. O

But O
he O
refused O
to O
give O
it O
to O
me O
. O
'' O

Jezebel O
answered O
, O
`` O
But O
you O
are O
the O
king O
over O
Israel O
! O

Get O
out O
of O
bed O
and O
eat O
something O
, O
and O
you O
will O
feel O
better O
. O

I O
will O
get O
Naboth O
's O
vineyard O
for O
you O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jezebel O
wrote O
some O
letters O
. O

She O
signed O
Ahab O
's O
name O
to O
them O
and O
used O
his O
seal O
to O
seal O
the O
letters O
. O

Then O
she O
sent O
them O
to O
the O
elders O
and O
important O
men O
who O
lived O
in O
the O
same O
town O
as O
Naboth O
. O

This O
is O
what O
the O
letter O
said O
: O
`` O
Announce O
that O
there O
will O
be O
a O
day O
of O
fasting O
when O
the O
people O
will O
eat O
nothing O
. O

Then O
call O
all O
the O
people O
of O
the O
town O
together O
for O
a O
meeting O
. O

At O
the O
meeting O
we O
will O
talk O
about O
Naboth O
. O

Find O
some O
men O
who O
will O
tell O
lies O
about O
Naboth O
. O

They O
should O
say O
that O
they O
heard O
Naboth O
speak O
against O
the O
king O
and O
against O
God O
. O

Then O
take O
Naboth O
out O
of O
the O
city O
and O
kill O
him O
with O
stones O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
elders O
and O
important O
men O
of O
Jezreel O
obeyed O
the O
command O
. O

The O
leaders O
announced O
that O
there O
would O
be O
a O
day O
when O
all O
the O
people O
would O
eat O
nothing O
. O

On O
that O
day O
they O
called O
all O
the O
people O
together O
for O
a O
meeting O
. O

They O
put O
Naboth O
in O
a O
special O
place O
before O
the O
people O
. O

Then O
two O
men O
told O
the O
people O
that O
they O
heard O
Naboth O
speak O
against O
God O
and O
the O
king O
. O

So O
the O
people O
carried O
Naboth O
out O
of O
the O
city O
and O
killed O
him O
with O
stones O
. O

Then O
the O
leaders O
sent O
a O
message O
to O
Jezebel O
that O
said O
: O
`` O
Naboth O
has O
been O
killed O
. O
'' O

When O
Jezebel O
heard O
this O
, O
she O
said O
to O
Ahab O
, O
`` O
Naboth O
is O
dead O
. O

Now O
you O
can O
go O
and O
take O
the O
vineyard O
that O
you O
wanted O
. O
'' O

So O
Ahab O
went O
to O
the O
vineyard O
and O
took O
it O
for O
his O
own O
. O

Then O
the O
Lord O
spoke O
to O
Elijah O
, O
the O
prophet O
from O
Tishbe O
. O

The O
Lord O
said O
, O
`` O
Go O
to O
King O
Ahab O
in O
Samaria O
. O

He O
will O
be O
at O
Naboth O
's O
vineyard O
. O

He O
is O
there O
to O
take O
the O
vineyard O
as O
his O
own O
. O

Tell O
Ahab O
that O
I O
, O
the O
Lord O
, O
say O
to O
him O
, O
' O
Ahab O
! O

You O
killed O
the O
man O
Naboth O
and O
now O
you O
are O
taking O
his O
land O
. O

I O
tell O
you O
this O
: O
Where O
the O
dogs O
licked O
up O
the O
blood O
of O
Naboth O
, O
they O
will O
lick O
up O
your O
blood O
as O
well O
. O
' O
'' O

So O
Elijah O
went O
to O
Ahab O
. O

When O
Ahab O
saw O
him O
, O
he O
said O
, O
`` O
Well O
, O
my O
enemy O
has O
found O
me O
again O
! O
'' O

Elijah O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
I O
found O
you O
, O
because O
you O
have O
again O
sold O
yourself O
out O
to O
do O
what O
the O
Lord O
says O
is O
evil O
. O

So O
the O
Lord O
says O
to O
you O
, O
' O
I O
will O
make O
something O
bad O
happen O
to O
you O
. O

I O
will O
kill O
you O
and O
every O
male O
in O
your O
family O
. O

I O
will O
destroy O
your O
family O
just O
as O
I O
destroyed O
the O
families O
of O
King O
Jeroboam O
son O
of O
Nebat O
and O
King O
Baasha O
. O

I O
will O
do O
this O
to O
you O
because O
you O
have O
made O
me O
angry O
and O
you O
have O
caused O
the O
Israelites O
to O
sin O
. O
' O

The O
Lord O
also O
says O
this O
about O
your O
wife O
Jezebel O
: O
' O
Dogs O
will O
eat O
the O
body O
of O
Jezebel O
by O
the O
wall O
of O
the O
city O
of O
Jezreel O
. O

As O
for O
the O
family O
of O
Ahab O
, O
whoever O
dies O
in O
the O
city O
will O
be O
eaten O
by O
dogs O
, O
and O
whoever O
dies O
in O
the O
fields O
will O
be O
eaten O
by O
birds O
. O
' O
'' O

So O
Ahab O
sold O
himself O
out O
to O
do O
what O
the O
Lord O
says O
is O
evil O
. O

There O
is O
no O
one O
who O
did O
as O
much O
evil O
as O
Ahab O
and O
his O
wife O
Jezebel O
, O
who O
caused O
him O
to O
do O
these O
things O
. O

Ahab O
committed O
the O
terrible O
sin O
of O
worshiping O
those O
filthy O
idols O
, O
just O
as O
the O
Amorites O
did O
. O

And O
that O
is O
why O
the O
Lord O
took O
the O
land O
from O
them O
and O
gave O
it O
to O
the O
Israelites O
. O

When O
Ahab O
heard O
what O
Elijah O
said O
, O
he O
tore O
his O
clothes O
to O
show O
how O
sad O
he O
was O
. O

Then O
he O
put O
on O
sackcloth O
and O
refused O
to O
eat O
. O

He O
even O
slept O
in O
these O
clothes O
. O

He O
was O
very O
sad O
and O
upset O
. O

The O
Lord O
said O
to O
the O
prophet O
Elijah O
from O
Tishbe O
, O
`` O
Look O
, O
Ahab O
has O
humbled O
himself O
before O
me O
. O

So O
I O
will O
not O
make O
that O
disaster O
happen O
during O
his O
lifetime O
. O

I O
will O
wait O
until O
his O
son O
is O
king O
. O

Then O
I O
will O
destroy O
his O
family O
. O
'' O

The O
time O
came O
for O
David O
to O
die O
, O
so O
he O
gave O
these O
commands O
to O
Solomon O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
about O
to O
die O
, O
like O
all O
men O
must O
. O

But O
you O
are O
growing O
stronger O
and O
becoming O
a O
man O
. O

Now O
, O
carefully O
obey O
all O
the O
commands O
of O
the O
Lord O
your O
God O
. O

Carefully O
obey O
all O
his O
laws O
, O
commands O
, O
decisions O
, O
and O
agreements O
. O

Obey O
everything O
that O
is O
written O
in O
the O
Law O
of O
Moses O
. O

If O
you O
do O
this O
, O
you O
will O
be O
successful O
at O
whatever O
you O
do O
and O
wherever O
you O
go O
. O

And O
if O
you O
obey O
the O
Lord O
, O
he O
will O
keep O
his O
promise O
about O
me O
. O

He O
said O
, O
' O
If O
your O
sons O
carefully O
live O
the O
way O
I O
tell O
them O
, O
sincerely O
, O
with O
all O
their O
heart O
, O
the O
king O
of O
Israel O
will O
always O
be O
a O
man O
from O
your O
family O
. O
' O
'' O

David O
also O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
remember O
what O
Joab O
son O
of O
Zeruiah O
did O
to O
me O
. O

He O
killed O
two O
of O
the O
commanders O
of O
Israel O
's O
army O
, O
Abner O
son O
of O
Ner O
and O
Amasa O
son O
of O
Jether O
. O

Remember O
, O
it O
was O
during O
a O
time O
of O
peace O
when O
he O
spilled O
the O
blood O
that O
splattered O
onto O
his O
sword O
belt O
and O
army O
boots O
. O

I O
should O
have O
punished O
him O
then O
. O

Use O
your O
wisdom O
, O
but O
do O
n't O
let O
him O
die O
peacefully O
of O
old O
age O
. O

`` O
Also O
, O
be O
kind O
to O
the O
children O
of O
Barzillai O
from O
Gilead O
. O

Be O
friends O
with O
them O
, O
and O
let O
them O
eat O
at O
your O
table O
, O
because O
they O
helped O
me O
when O
I O
ran O
away O
from O
your O
brother O
Absalom O
. O

`` O
And O
remember O
, O
Shimei O
son O
of O
Gera O
is O
still O
around O
. O

He O
is O
the O
Benjamite O
from O
Bahurim O
who O
cursed O
me O
when O
I O
ran O
away O
to O
Mahanaim O
. O

But O
when O
he O
came O
down O
to O
meet O
me O
at O
the O
Jordan O
River O
, O
I O
made O
a O
promise O
to O
him O
before O
the O
Lord O
that O
I O
would O
not O
kill O
him O
. O

Now O
, O
do O
n't O
leave O
him O
unpunished O
. O

You O
are O
a O
wise O
man O
. O

You O
will O
know O
what O
you O
must O
do O
, O
but O
do O
n't O
let O
him O
die O
peacefully O
of O
old O
age O
. O
'' O

Then O
David O
died O
and O
was O
buried O
in O
the O
City O
of O
David O
. O

David O
ruled O
Israel O
40 O
years O
. O

He O
ruled O
seven O
years O
in O
Hebron O
and O
33 O
years O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

Now O
Solomon O
was O
king O
. O

He O
sat O
on O
the O
throne O
of O
his O
father O
David O
and O
was O
in O
complete O
control O
of O
his O
kingdom O
. O

One O
day O
Adonijah O
, O
the O
son O
of O
Haggith O
, O
went O
to O
Solomon O
's O
mother O
, O
Bathsheba O
. O

She O
asked O
him O
, O
`` O
Do O
you O
come O
in O
peace O
? O
'' O

Adonijah O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
this O
is O
a O
peaceful O
visit O
. O

I O
have O
something O
to O
ask O
you O
. O
'' O

Bathsheba O
said O
, O
`` O
Then O
speak O
. O
'' O

Adonijah O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
know O
that O
at O
one O
time O
the O
kingdom O
was O
mine O
. O

All O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
wanted O
me O
to O
be O
their O
king O
. O

But O
things O
have O
changed O
, O
and O
now O
my O
brother O
is O
the O
king O
. O

The O
Lord O
chose O
him O
to O
be O
king O
. O

But O
now O
I O
have O
one O
thing O
to O
ask O
you O
. O

Please O
do O
n't O
refuse O
me O
. O
'' O

Bathsheba O
answered O
, O
`` O
What O
do O
you O
want O
? O
'' O

Adonijah O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
know O
that O
King O
Solomon O
will O
do O
whatever O
you O
ask O

So O
please O
ask O
him O
to O
let O
me O
marry O
Abishag O
, O
the O
woman O
from O
Shunem O
. O
'' O

Then O
Bathsheba O
said O
, O
`` O
Very O
well O
, O
I O
will O
speak O
to O
the O
king O
for O
you O

'' O

So O
Bathsheba O
went O
to O
King O
Solomon O
to O
talk O
with O
him O
. O

When O
the O
king O
saw O
her O
, O
he O
stood O
up O
, O
bowed O
before O
her O
, O
and O
then O
sat O
back O
down O
. O

He O
told O
some O
servants O
to O
bring O
another O
throne O
for O
his O
mother O
, O
and O
she O
sat O
down O
at O
his O
right O
side O
. O

Bathsheba O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
I O
have O
one O
small O
thing O
to O
ask O
you O
. O

Please O
do O
n't O
refuse O
me O

'' O

The O
king O
answered O
, O
`` O
Ask O
whatever O
you O
want O
, O
mother O
. O

I O
will O
not O
refuse O
you O

'' O

So O
Bathsheba O
said O
, O
`` O
Let O
your O
brother O
Adonijah O
marry O
Abishag O
, O
the O
woman O
from O
Shunem O
. O
'' O

King O
Solomon O
answered O
his O
mother O
, O
`` O
Why O
are O
you O
asking O
me O
to O
give O
Abishag O
to O
Adonijah O
? O

Why O
do O
n't O
you O
just O
ask O
me O
to O
give O
him O
the O
whole O
kingdom O
! O

After O
all O
, O
he O
is O
my O
older O
brother O
, O
and O
both O
Abiathar O
the O
priest O
and O
Joab O
support O
him O
! O
'' O

Then O
Solomon O
said O
, O
`` O
By O
the O
Lord O
, O
I O
swear O
I O
'll O
make O
Adonijah O
pay O
for O
this O
with O
his O
life O
! O

The O
Lord O
made O
me O
the O
king O
of O
Israel O
. O

He O
gave O
me O
the O
throne O
of O
my O
father O
David O
. O

The O
Lord O
kept O
his O
promise O
and O
gave O
the O
kingdom O
to O
me O
and O
my O
family O
. O

Now O
, O
as O
surely O
as O
the O
Lord O
lives O
, O
I O
swear O
Adonijah O
will O
die O
today O
! O
'' O

King O
Solomon O
gave O
the O
command O
to O
Benaiah O
, O
and O
Benaiah O
went O
out O
and O
killed O
Adonijah O
. O

Then O
King O
Solomon O
said O
to O
Abiathar O
the O
priest O
, O
`` O
I O
should O
kill O
you O
, O
but O
I O
will O
let O
you O
go O
back O
to O
your O
home O
in O
Anathoth O
. O

I O
will O
not O
kill O
you O
now O
because O
you O
helped O
carry O
the O
Holy O
Box O
of O
the O
Lord O
while O
marching O
with O
my O
father O
David O
. O

And O
I O
know O
that O
you O
shared O
in O
the O
hard O
times O
with O
my O
father O
. O
'' O

So O
Solomon O
told O
Abiathar O
that O
he O
could O
not O
continue O
to O
serve O
as O
a O
priest O
of O
the O
Lord O
. O

This O
happened O
as O
the O
Lord O
said O
it O
would O
when O
he O
told O
Eli O
the O
priest O
what O
would O
happen O
to O
him O
and O
his O
family O
. O

Joab O
had O
supported O
Adonijah O
, O
but O
not O
Absalom O
. O

But O
when O
Joab O
heard O
what O
happened O
to O
Abiathar O
, O
he O
was O
frightened O
and O
ran O
to O
the O
tent O
of O
the O
Lord O
to O
hold O
onto O
the O
horns O
of O
the O
altar O
. O

Someone O
told O
King O
Solomon O
that O
Joab O
was O
at O
the O
altar O
in O
the O
Lord O
's O
Tent O
. O

So O
Solomon O
ordered O
Benaiah O
to O
go O
and O
kill O
him O
. O

Benaiah O
went O
into O
the O
Lord O
's O
Tent O
and O
said O
to O
Joab O
, O
`` O
The O
king O
says O
, O
' O
Come O
out O
! O
' O
'' O

But O
Joab O
answered O
, O
`` O
No O
, O
I O
will O
die O
here O
. O
'' O

Benaiah O
went O
back O
to O
the O
king O
and O
told O
him O
what O
Joab O
had O
said O
. O

The O
king O
commanded O
Benaiah O
, O
`` O
Do O
as O
he O
says O
! O

Kill O
him O
there O
and O
take O
him O
out O
to O
bury O
him O
. O

Then O
my O
family O
and O
I O
will O
be O
free O
of O
Joab O
's O
guilt O
from O
killing O
innocent O
people O
. O

Joab O
killed O
two O
men O
who O
were O
much O
better O
than O
he O
was O
. O

He O
killed O
Abner O
son O
of O
Ner O
, O
the O
commander O
of O
the O
army O
of O
Israel O
, O
and O
Amasa O
son O
of O
Jether O
, O
the O
commander O
of O
the O
army O
of O
Judah O
. O

He O
did O
this O
without O
my O
father O
's O
knowledge O
. O

But O
now O
the O
Lord O
will O
punish O
Joab O
for O
the O
men O
he O
killed O
. O

He O
and O
his O
family O
will O
always O
be O
guilty O
for O
their O
deaths O
. O

But O
the O
Lord O
will O
bring O
peace O
to O
David O
, O
his O
descendants O
, O
his O
family O
of O
kings O
, O
and O
his O
kingdom O
forever O
. O
'' O

So O
Benaiah O
son O
of O
Jehoiada O
killed O
Joab O
, O
and O
he O
was O
buried O
near O
his O
home O
in O
the O
desert O
. O

Solomon O
then O
made O
Benaiah O
son O
of O
Jehoiada O
the O
commander O
of O
the O
army O
in O
Joab O
's O
place O
. O

Solomon O
also O
made O
Zadok O
the O
new O
high O
priest O
in O
Abiathar O
's O
place O
. O

Next O
, O
the O
king O
sent O
for O
Shimei O
and O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Build O
yourself O
a O
house O
here O
in O
Jerusalem O
to O
live O
in O
and O
do O
n't O
leave O
the O
city O
. O

If O
you O
leave O
the O
city O
and O
go O
any O
further O
than O
Kidron O
Brook O
, O
you O
will O
be O
killed O
, O
and O
it O
will O
be O
your O
own O
fault O
. O
'' O

Shimei O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
my O
king O
. O

I O
will O
obey O
you O
. O
'' O

So O
Shimei O
lived O
in O
Jerusalem O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

But O
three O
years O
later O
, O
two O
of O
Shimei O
's O
slaves O
ran O
away O
. O

They O
went O
to O
King O
Achish O
of O
Gath O
, O
who O
was O
the O
son O
of O
Maacah O
. O

Shimei O
heard O
that O
his O
slaves O
were O
in O
Gath O
, O
so O
he O
saddled O
his O
donkey O
and O
went O
to O
King O
Achish O
at O
Gath O
to O
find O
them O
. O

He O
found O
them O
there O
and O
brought O
them O
back O
home O
. O

But O
someone O
told O
Solomon O
that O
Shimei O
had O
left O
Jerusalem O
and O
gone O
to O
Gath O
and O
back O
. O

So O
Solomon O
sent O
for O
him O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
made O
you O
promise O
in O
the O
Lord O
's O
name O
not O
to O
leave O
Jerusalem O
. O

And O
I O
warned O
you O
that O
if O
you O
went O
anywhere O
, O
you O
would O
die O
. O

And O
you O
agreed O
to O
what O
I O
said O
. O

You O
said O
that O
you O
would O
obey O
me O
. O

So O
why O
did O
n't O
you O
obey O
me O
? O

Why O
did O
you O
break O
your O
promise O
? O

You O
know O
all O
the O
bad O
things O
you O
did O
to O
my O
father O
David O
. O

Now O
the O
Lord O
will O
punish O
you O
for O
it O
. O

But O
the O
Lord O
will O
bless O
me O
and O
keep O
David O
's O
throne O
before O
him O
forever O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
king O
ordered O
Benaiah O
to O
kill O
Shimei O
, O
and O
he O
did O
. O

So O
Solomon O
had O
full O
control O
of O
his O
kingdom O
. O

King O
Solomon O
also O
built O
a O
palace O
for O
himself O
. O

It O
took O
13 O
years O
to O
build O
Solomon O
's O
palace O
. O

He O
also O
built O
the O
building O
called O
the O
`` O
Forest O
of O
Lebanon O
. O
'' O

It O
was O
100 O
cubits O
long O
, O
50 O
cubits O
wide O
, O
and O
30 O
cubits O
high O
. O

It O
had O
four O
rows O
of O
cedar O
columns O
. O

On O
top O
of O
each O
column O
was O
a O
cedar O
capital O
. O

There O
were O
cedar O
beams O
going O
across O
the O
rows O
of O
columns O
. O

There O
were O
15 O
beams O
for O
each O
section O
of O
columns O
. O

There O
was O
a O
total O
of O
45 O
beams O
. O

On O
top O
of O
these O
beams O
there O
were O
cedar O
boards O
for O
the O
ceiling O
. O

There O
were O
three O
rows O
of O
windows O
across O
from O
each O
other O
on O
the O
side O
walls O
. O

There O
were O
three O
doors O
at O
each O
end O
. O

All O
the O
door O
openings O
and O
frames O
were O
square O
. O

Solomon O
also O
built O
the O
Porch O
of O
Columns O
. O

It O
was O
50 O
cubits O
long O
and O
30 O
cubits O
wide O
. O

Along O
the O
front O
of O
the O
porch O
, O
there O
was O
a O
covering O
supported O
by O
columns O
. O

He O
also O
built O
a O
throne O
room O
where O
he O
judged O
people O
. O

He O
called O
this O
the O
Judgment O
Hall O
. O

The O
room O
was O
covered O
with O
cedar O
from O
floor O
to O
ceiling O
. O

Behind O
the O
Judgment O
Hall O
was O
a O
courtyard O
. O

The O
palace O
where O
Solomon O
lived O
was O
built O
around O
that O
courtyard O
and O
looked O
like O
the O
Judgment O
Hall O
. O

He O
also O
built O
the O
same O
kind O
of O
palace O
for O
his O
wife O
, O
the O
daughter O
of O
the O
king O
of O
Egypt O
. O

All O
these O
buildings O
were O
made O
with O
expensive O
blocks O
of O
stone O
. O

The O
stones O
were O
cut O
to O
the O
right O
size O
with O
a O
saw O
and O
then O
smoothed O
on O
front O
and O
back O
. O

These O
expensive O
stones O
went O
from O
the O
foundation O
all O
the O
way O
up O
to O
the O
top O
layer O
of O
the O
wall O
. O

Even O
the O
wall O
around O
the O
yard O
was O
made O
with O
expensive O
blocks O
of O
stone O
. O

The O
foundations O
were O
made O
with O
large O
, O
expensive O
stones O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
stones O
were O
10 O
cubits O
long O
and O
the O
others O
were O
8 O
cubits O
long O
. O

On O
top O
of O
these O
stones O
there O
were O
other O
expensive O
stones O
and O
cedar O
beams O
. O

There O
were O
walls O
around O
the O
palace O
yard O
, O
the O
Temple O
yard O
, O
and O
the O
porch O
of O
the O
Temple O
. O

The O
walls O
were O
built O
with O
three O
rows O
of O
stone O
and O
one O
row O
of O
cedar O
timbers O
. O

King O
Solomon O
sent O
for O
a O
man O
named O
Huram O
who O
lived O
in O
Tyre O
and O
brought O
him O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

Huram O
's O
mother O
was O
an O
Israelite O
from O
the O
tribe O
of O
Naphtali O
. O

His O
dead O
father O
was O
from O
Tyre O
. O

Huram O
made O
things O
from O
bronze O
. O

He O
was O
a O
very O
skilled O
and O
experienced O
builder O
. O

So O
King O
Solomon O
asked O
him O
to O
come O
, O
and O
Huram O
accepted O
. O

King O
Solomon O
put O
him O
in O
charge O
of O
all O
the O
bronze O
work O
, O
and O
Huram O
did O
all O
the O
work O
he O
was O
given O
to O
do O
. O

Huram O
made O
two O
bronze O
columns O
for O
the O
porch O
. O

Each O
column O
was O
18 O
cubits O
tall O
and O
12 O
cubits O
around O
. O

The O
columns O
were O
hollow O
and O
their O
metal O
walls O
were O
3 O
inches O
thick O
. O

He O
also O
made O
two O
bronze O
capitals O
that O
were O
5 O
cubits O
tall O
. O

He O
put O
these O
capitals O
on O
top O
of O
the O
columns O
. O

He O
made O
two O
nets O
of O
chain O
to O
cover O
the O
capitals O
on O
top O
of O
the O
two O
columns O
. O

Then O
he O
made O
two O
rows O
of O
bronze O
pomegranates O
. O

He O
put O
the O
bronze O
pomegranates O
on O
the O
nets O
of O
each O
column O
to O
cover O
the O
capitals O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
columns O
. O

The O
capitals O
on O
top O
of O
the O
columns O
were O
shaped O
like O
flowers O
. O

The O
capitals O
were O
on O
top O
of O
the O
columns O
, O
above O
the O
bowl-shaped O
net O
. O

There O
were O
200 O
pomegranates O
in O
rows O
all O
around O
the O
capitals O
. O

Huram O
put O
these O
two O
bronze O
columns O
at O
the O
porch O
of O
the O
Temple O
. O

One O
column O
was O
put O
on O
the O
south O
side O
of O
the O
entrance O
and O
one O
was O
put O
on O
the O
north O
side O
of O
it O
. O

The O
column O
on O
the O
south O
was O
named O
Jakin O
. O

The O
column O
on O
the O
north O
was O
named O
Boaz O
. O

They O
put O
the O
flower-shaped O
capitals O
on O
top O
of O
the O
columns O
, O
and O
the O
work O
on O
the O
two O
columns O
was O
finished O
. O

Then O
Huram O
melted O
bronze O
and O
poured O
it O
into O
a O
huge O
mold O
to O
make O
a O
tank O
, O
which O
was O
called O
`` O
The O
Sea O
. O
'' O

The O
tank O
was O
about O
30 O
cubits O
around O
. O

It O
was O
10 O
cubits O
across O
and O
5 O
cubits O
deep O
. O

There O
was O
a O
rim O
around O
the O
outer O
edge O
of O
the O
tank O
. O

Under O
this O
rim O
there O
were O
two O
rows O
of O
bronze O
gourds O
all O
around O
the O
tank O
. O

The O
bronze O
gourds O
were O
made O
in O
one O
piece O
as O
part O
of O
the O
tank O
. O

The O
tank O
rested O
on O
the O
backs O
of O
12 O
bronze O
bulls O
. O

All O
12 O
of O
the O
bulls O
were O
looking O
out O
, O
away O
from O
the O
tank O
. O

Three O
were O
looking O
north O
, O
three O
east O
, O
three O
south O
, O
and O
three O
west O
. O

The O
sides O
of O
the O
tank O
were O
3 O
inches O
thick O
. O

The O
rim O
around O
the O
tank O
was O
like O
the O
rim O
of O
a O
cup O
or O
like O
the O
petals O
on O
a O
flower O
. O

The O
tank O
held O
about O
11,000 O
gallons O
of O
water O

Then O
Huram O
made O
ten O
bronze O
carts O
. O

Each O
cart O
was O
4 O
cubits O
long O
, O
4 O
cubits O
wide O
, O
and O
3 O
cubits O
high O
. O

The O
carts O
were O
made O
with O
square O
panels O
set O
in O
frames O
. O

On O
the O
panels O
and O
frames O
were O
bronze O
bulls O
, O
lions O
, O
and O
Cherub O
angels O
. O

There O
were O
designs O
of O
flowers O
hammered O
into O
the O
bronze O
above O
and O
below O
the O
bulls O
and O
lions O
. O

Each O
cart O
had O
four O
bronze O
wheels O
with O
bronze O
axles O
. O

At O
the O
corners O
there O
were O
bronze O
supports O
for O
a O
large O
bowl O
. O

The O
supports O
had O
designs O
of O
flowers O
hammered O
into O
the O
bronze O
. O

There O
was O
a O
frame O
around O
the O
top O
with O
an O
opening O
for O
the O
bowl O
. O

The O
frame O
was O
1 O
cubit O
tall O
, O
and O
the O
opening O
was O
1 O
1/2 O
cubits O
in O
diameter O
. O

There O
were O
designs O
carved O
into O
the O
bronze O
on O
the O
frame O
. O

The O
frame O
was O
square O
, O
not O
round O
. O

There O
were O
four O
wheels O
under O
the O
frame O
. O

The O
wheels O
were O
1 O
1/2 O
cubits O
in O
diameter O
. O

The O
axles O
between O
the O
wheels O
were O
made O
as O
one O
piece O
with O
the O
cart O
. O

The O
wheels O
were O
like O
the O
wheels O
on O
a O
chariot O
. O

Everything O
on O
the O
wheels O
-- O
the O
axles O
, O
the O
rims O
, O
the O
spokes O
, O
and O
the O
hubs O
were O
made O
from O
bronze O
. O

There O
were O
supports O
at O
each O
of O
the O
four O
corners O
of O
the O
carts O
. O

They O
were O
made O
as O
one O
piece O
with O
the O
cart O
. O

There O
was O
a O
strip O
of O
bronze O
around O
the O
top O
of O
each O
cart O
. O

It O
was O
made O
as O
one O
piece O
with O
the O
cart O
. O

The O
sides O
of O
the O
cart O
and O
the O
frames O
had O
pictures O
of O
Cherub O
angels O
, O
lions O
, O
and O
palm O
trees O
carved O
into O
the O
bronze O
. O

These O
pictures O
were O
carved O
all O
over O
the O
carts O
-- O
wherever O
there O
was O
room O
. O

And O
there O
were O
flowers O
carved O
on O
the O
frame O
around O
the O
cart O
. O

Huram O
made O
ten O
carts O
, O
and O
they O
were O
all O
the O
same O
. O

Each O
cart O
was O
made O
from O
bronze O
. O

The O
bronze O
was O
melted O
and O
poured O
into O
a O
mold O
. O

So O
all O
the O
carts O
were O
the O
same O
size O
and O
shape O
. O

Huram O
also O
made O
ten O
bowls O
. O

There O
was O
one O
bowl O
for O
each O
of O
the O
ten O
carts O
. O

Each O
bowl O
was O
4 O
cubits O
across O
and O
could O
hold O
about O
230 O
gallons O
. O

He O
put O
five O
carts O
on O
the O
south O
side O
of O
the O
Temple O
and O
five O
carts O
on O
the O
north O
side O
. O

He O
put O
the O
large O
tank O
in O
the O
southeast O
corner O
of O
the O
Temple O
. O

Huram O
also O
made O
pots O
, O
small O
shovels O
, O
and O
small O
bowls O
. O

He O
finished O
making O
all O
the O
things O
King O
Solomon O
wanted O
him O
to O
make O
. O

This O
is O
a O
list O
of O
the O
things O
that O
Huram O
made O
for O
the O
Temple O
of O
the O
Lord O
: O
3 O
columns O
; O
3 O
capitals O
shaped O
like O
bowls O
for O
the O
top O
of O
the O
columns O
; O
3 O
nets O
to O
go O
around O
the O
capitals O
; O
400 O
pomegranates O
for O
the O
two O
nets O
-LRB- O
two O
rows O
of O
pomegranates O
for O
each O
net O
to O
cover O
the O
two O
bowls O
for O
the O
capitals O
on O
top O
of O
the O
columns O
-RRB- O
; O
10 O
carts O
with O
a O
bowl O
on O
each O
cart O
; O
the O
large O
tank O
with O
12 O
bulls O
under O
it O
; O
the O
pots O
, O
small O
shovels O
, O
small O
bowls O
, O
and O
all O
the O
dishes O
for O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
. O

Huram O
made O
everything O
King O
Solomon O
wanted O
. O

They O
were O
all O
made O
from O
polished O
bronze O
. O

Solomon O
never O
weighed O
the O
bronze O
that O
was O
used O
to O
make O
these O
things O
. O

There O
was O
too O
much O
to O
weigh O
. O

So O
the O
total O
weight O
of O
all O
the O
bronze O
was O
never O
known O
. O

The O
king O
ordered O
these O
things O
to O
be O
made O
near O
the O
Jordan O
River O
between O
Succoth O
and O
Zarethan O
. O

They O
made O
them O
by O
melting O
the O
bronze O
and O
pouring O
it O
into O
molds O
in O
the O
ground O
. O

Solomon O
also O
commanded O
that O
all O
these O
things O
be O
made O
from O
gold O
for O
the O
Temple O
: O
the O

So O
King O
Solomon O
finished O
all O
the O
work O
he O
wanted O
to O
do O
for O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
. O

Then O
he O
took O
everything O
his O
father O
David O
had O
saved O
for O
this O
special O
purpose O
and O
put O
them O
in O
the O
Temple O
. O

He O
put O
the O
silver O
and O
gold O
in O
the O
special O
storage O
rooms O
in O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
. O

Then O
King O
Solomon O
told O
all O
the O
elders O
of O
Israel O
, O
the O
heads O
of O
the O
tribes O
, O
and O
the O
leaders O
of O
the O
families O
of O
Israel O
to O
come O
together O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

Solomon O
wanted O
them O
to O
join O
in O
moving O
the O
Box O
of O
the O
Agreement O
from O
the O
City O
of O
David O
up O
to O
the O
Temple O
. O

So O
during O
the O
special O
festival O
in O
the O
month O
of O
Ethanim O
, O
the O
seventh O
month O
of O
the O
year O
, O
all O
the O
men O
of O
Israel O
came O
to O
the O
meeting O
with O
King O
Solomon O
. O

When O
all O
the O
elders O
of O
Israel O
arrived O
, O
the O
priests O
and O
Levites O
carried O
the O
Holy O
Box O
of O
the O
Lord O
up O
to O
the O
Temple O
. O

They O
also O
carried O
the O
Meeting O
Tent O
and O
all O
the O
holy O
things O
that O
were O
in O
it O
up O
to O
the O
Temple O
. O

King O
Solomon O
and O
all O
Israel O
met O
together O
before O
the O
Box O
of O
the O
Agreement O
and O
sacrificed O
so O
many O
sheep O
and O
cattle O
that O
no O
one O
was O
able O
to O
count O
them O
all O
. O

The O
priests O
carried O
the O
Box O
of O
the O
Agreement O
of O
the O
Lord O
to O
its O
proper O
place O
inside O
the O
Most O
Holy O
Place O
in O
the O
Temple O
, O
under O
the O
wings O
of O
the O
Cherub O
angels O
. O

The O
wings O
of O
the O
Cherub O
angels O
spread O
out O
over O
the O
Holy O
Box O
, O
and O
they O
covered O
the O
Holy O
Box O
and O
its O
carrying O
poles O
. O

The O
poles O
are O
still O
there O
today O
. O

They O
are O
too O
long O
for O
the O
Most O
Holy O
Place O
, O
so O
anyone O
standing O
in O
the O
Holy O
Place O
can O
see O
the O
ends O
of O
the O
poles O
, O
although O
no O
one O
outside O
can O
see O
them O
. O

The O
only O
things O
inside O
the O
Holy O
Box O
are O
the O
two O
tablets O
that O
Moses O
put O
there O
at O
Mt. O
Horeb O
. O

This O
is O
where O
the O
Lord O
made O
his O
agreement O
with O
the O
Israelites O
after O
they O
came O
out O
of O
Egypt O
. O

When O
the O
priests O
came O
out O
of O
the O
Holy O
Place O
, O
the O
cloud O
filled O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
. O

The O
priests O
could O
not O
continue O
their O
work O
because O
the O
Temple O
was O
filled O
with O
the O
Glory O
of O
the O
Lord O
. O

Then O
Solomon O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
Lord O
caused O
the O
sun O
to O
shine O
in O
the O
sky O
, O
but O
he O
chose O
to O
live O
in O
a O
dark O
cloud O
. O

Now O
, O
Lord O
, O
I O
have O
built O
a O
beautiful O
Temple O
for O
you O
, O
where O
you O
may O
live O
forever O
. O
'' O

Then O
King O
Solomon O
turned O
toward O
all O
the O
Israelites O
who O
were O
standing O
there O
and O
asked O
God O
to O
bless O
them O
. O

He O
prayed O
this O
long O
prayer O
to O
the O
Lord O
: O
`` O
The O
Lord O
, O
the O
God O
of O
Israel O
, O
is O
great O

He O
has O
done O
what O
he O
promised O
my O
father O
David O

He O
told O
my O
father O
, O
' O
I O
brought O
my O
people O
, O
Israel O
, O
out O
of O
Egypt O
, O
but O
I O
had O
not O
yet O
chosen O
a O
city O
from O
among O
the O
tribes O
of O
Israel O
for O
a O
temple O
to O
honor O
me O
. O

And O
I O
had O
not O
chosen O
a O
man O
to O
be O
leader O
over O
my O
people O
, O
Israel O
. O

But O
now O
I O
have O
chosen O
Jerusalem O
to O
be O
the O
city O
where O
I O
will O
be O
honored O
. O

And O
I O
have O
chosen O
David O
to O
rule O
over O
my O
people O
, O
Israel O
. O
' O

`` O
My O
father O
David O
wanted O
very O
much O
to O
build O
a O
temple O
to O
honor O
the O
Lord O

God O
of O
Israel O

But O
the O
Lord O
said O
to O
my O

, O
' O
I O
know O
that O
you O
want O
very O
much O

it O
is O
good O

you O

`` O

I O
have O
built O

God O

I O
have O
made O

Lord O
made O
with O

out O

Then O
Solomon O
stood O
in O

of O
whole O
assembly O
of O
Israel O
and O
faced O
the O
Lord O
's O
altar O

Solomon O
spread O
his O
hands O

looked O
toward O

and O
said O
, O

said O
, O
`` O
Praise O
the O
Lord O
! O

He O
promised O
to O
give O
rest O
to O
his O
people O
, O
Israel O
. O

And O
he O
has O
given O
us O
rest O
! O

He O
used O
his O
servant O
Moses O
and O
made O
many O
good O
promises O
to O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
. O

And O
he O
has O
kept O
every O
one O
of O
them O
! O

I O
pray O
that O
the O
Lord O
our O
God O
will O
be O
with O
us O
, O
as O
he O
was O
with O
our O
ancestors O
. O

I O
pray O
that O
he O
will O
never O
leave O
us O
. O

I O
pray O
that O
we O
will O
turn O
to O
him O
and O
follow O
him O
. O

Then O
we O
will O
obey O
all O
the O
laws O
, O
decisions O
, O
and O
commands O
that O
he O
gave O
our O
ancestors O
. O

I O
pray O
that O
the O
Lord O
our O
God O
will O
always O
remember O
this O
prayer O
and O
what O
I O
have O
asked O
. O

I O
pray O
that O
he O
will O
do O
these O
things O
for O
his O
servant O
, O
the O
king O
, O
and O
for O
his O
people O
, O
Israel O
. O

I O
pray O
that O
he O
will O
do O
this O
every O
day O
. O

If O
he O
will O
do O
these O
things O
, O
all O
the O
people O
of O
the O
world O
will O
know O
that O
the O
Lord O
is O
the O
only O
true O
God O
. O

You O
people O
must O
be O
loyal O
and O
true O
to O
the O
Lord O
our O
God O
. O

You O
must O
always O
follow O
and O
obey O
all O
of O
his O
laws O
and O
commands O
. O

You O
must O
continue O
to O
obey O
in O
the O
future O
as O
you O
do O
now O
. O
'' O

Then O
King O
Solomon O
and O
all O
the O
Israelites O
with O
him O
offered O
sacrifices O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

Solomon O
killed O
22,000 O
cattle O
and O
120,000 O
sheep O
for O
fellowship O
offerings O
. O

In O
this O
way O
the O
king O
and O
the O
people O
showed O
that O
they O
had O
dedicated O
the O
Temple O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

King O
Solomon O
also O
dedicated O
the O
yard O
in O
front O
of O
the O
Temple O
. O

He O
offered O
burnt O
offerings O
, O
grain O
offerings O
, O
and O
the O
fat O
from O
the O
animals O
that O
were O
used O
as O
fellowship O
offerings O
. O

King O
Solomon O
made O
these O
offerings O
there O
in O
the O
yard O
. O

He O
did O
this O
because O
the O
bronze O
altar O
in O
front O
of O
the O
Lord O
was O
too O
small O
to O
hold O
them O
all O
. O

So O
there O
at O
the O
Temple O
, O
King O
Solomon O
and O
all O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
celebrated O
the O
festival O
. O

People O
came O
from O
as O
far O
away O
as O
Hamath O
Pass O
in O
the O
north O
and O
the O
border O
of O
Egypt O
in O
the O
south O
. O

This O
huge O
crowd O
of O
people O
ate O
, O
drank O
, O
and O
enjoyed O
themselves O
together O
with O
the O
Lord O
for O
seven O
days O
. O

Then O
they O
stayed O
for O
another O
seven O
days O
. O

They O
celebrated O
for O
a O
total O
of O
14 O
days O
. O

The O
next O
day O
Solomon O
told O
the O
people O
to O
go O
home O
. O

All O
the O
people O
thanked O
the O
king O
, O
said O
goodbye O
, O
and O
went O
home O
. O

They O
were O
happy O
because O
of O
all O
the O
good O
things O
that O
the O
Lord O
had O
done O
for O
David O
his O
servant O
and O
for O
his O
people O
Israel O
. O

Solomon O
made O
a O
peace O
treaty O
with O
Pharaoh O
, O
the O
king O
of O
Egypt O
, O
by O
marrying O
his O
daughter O
. O

Solomon O
brought O
her O
to O
the O
City O
of O
David O
. O

This O
was O
when O
Solomon O
was O
still O
building O
his O
palace O
, O
the O
Temple O
of O
the O
Lord O
, O
and O
the O
wall O
around O
Jerusalem O
. O

The O
Temple O
had O
not O
yet O
been O
finished O
, O
so O
people O
were O
still O
making O
animal O
sacrifices O
on O
altars O
at O
the O
high O
places O
. O

Solomon O
showed O
that O
he O
loved O
the O
Lord O
by O
obeying O
everything O
his O
father O
David O
told O
him O
to O
do O
, O
except O
that O
Solomon O
continued O
to O
go O
to O
the O
high O
places O
to O
offer O
sacrifices O
and O
to O
burn O
incense O
. O

King O
Solomon O
went O
to O
Gibeon O
to O
offer O
a O
sacrifice O
because O
that O
was O
the O
most O
important O
high O
place O
. O

He O
offered O
a O
thousand O
burnt O
offerings O
on O
that O
altar O
. O

While O
Solomon O
was O
at O
Gibeon O
, O
the O
Lord O
came O
to O
him O
at O
night O
in O
a O
dream O
. O

God O
said O
, O
`` O
Solomon O
, O
ask O
me O
what O
you O
want O
me O
to O
give O
you O
. O
'' O

Solomon O
answered O
, O
`` O
You O
were O
very O
kind O
and O
loyal O
to O
your O
servant O
, O
my O
father O
David O
. O

He O
was O
faithful O
to O
you O
and O
lived O
a O
good O
, O
honest O
life O
. O

And O
you O
showed O
him O
the O
greatest O
kindness O
when O
you O
let O
his O
son O
take O
his O
place O
as O
king O
. O

Lord O
my O
God O
, O
you O
have O
made O
me O
the O
king O
in O
my O
father O
's O
place O
, O
but O
I O
am O
like O
a O
small O
child O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
have O
the O
wisdom O
I O
need O
to O
do O
what O
I O
must O
do O
. O

I O
am O
your O
servant O
here O
among O
your O
chosen O
people O
. O

There O
are O
so O
many O
that O
they O
can O
not O
be O
counted O
. O

So O
I O
ask O
you O
to O
give O
me O
the O
wisdom O
to O
rule O
and O
judge O
them O
well O
and O
to O
help O
me O
know O
the O
difference O
between O
right O
and O
wrong O
. O

Without O
such O
great O
wisdom O
, O
it O
would O
be O
impossible O
to O
rule O
this O
great O
nation O
. O
'' O

The O
Lord O
was O
happy O
that O
Solomon O
asked O
for O
wisdom O
. O

So O
God O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
You O
did O
not O
ask O
for O
long O
life O
and O
riches O
for O
yourself O
. O

You O
did O
not O
ask O
for O
the O
death O
of O
your O
enemies O
. O

You O
asked O
for O
the O
wisdom O
to O
listen O
and O
make O
the O
right O
decisions O
. O

So O
I O
will O
give O
you O
what O
you O
asked O
for O
. O

I O
will O
make O
you O
wise O
and O
intelligent O
. O

I O
will O
make O
you O
wiser O
than O
anyone O
who O
ever O
lived O
or O
ever O
will O
live O
. O

And O
I O
will O
also O
give O
you O
what O
you O
did O
not O
ask O
for O
. O

You O
will O
have O
riches O
and O
honor O
all O
your O
life O
. O

There O
will O
be O
no O
other O
king O
in O
the O
world O
as O
great O
as O
you O
. O

And O
I O
will O
give O
you O
a O
long O
life O
if O
you O
follow O
me O
and O
obey O
my O
laws O
and O
commands O
as O
your O
father O
David O
did O
. O
'' O

Solomon O
woke O
up O
and O
knew O
that O
God O
had O
spoken O
to O
him O
in O
the O
dream O
. O

Then O
Solomon O
went O
to O
Jerusalem O
and O
stood O
before O
the O
Box O
of O
the O
Lord O
's O
Agreement O
. O

He O
offered O
a O
burnt O
offering O
and O
fellowship O
offerings O
to O
the O
Lord O
and O
then O
gave O
a O
party O
for O
all O
of O
his O
officials O
. O

One O
day O
two O
prostitutes O
came O
to O
Solomon O
and O
stood O
before O
the O
king O
. O

One O
of O
the O
women O
said O
, O
`` O
Sir O
, O
this O
woman O
and O
I O
live O
in O
the O
same O
house O
. O

We O
were O
both O
pregnant O
and O
ready O
to O
give O
birth O
to O
our O
babies O
. O

I O
had O
my O
baby O
while O
she O
was O
there O
with O
me O
. O

Three O
days O
later O
she O
also O
gave O
birth O
to O
her O
baby O
. O

There O
was O
no O
one O
else O
in O
the O
house O
with O
us O
, O
just O
the O
two O
of O
us O
. O

One O
night O
while O
this O
woman O
was O
asleep O
with O
her O
baby O
, O
the O
baby O
died O
. O

That O
night O
while O
I O
was O
asleep O
, O
she O
took O
my O
son O
from O
my O
bed O
and O
carried O
him O
to O
her O
bed O
. O

Then O
she O
put O
the O
dead O
baby O
in O
my O
bed O
. O

In O
the O
morning O
I O
woke O
up O
and O
was O
about O
to O
feed O
the O
baby O
when O
I O
saw O
he O
was O
dead O
. O

When O
I O
looked O
at O
him O
more O
closely O
, O
I O
saw O
that O
he O
was O
not O
my O
baby O
. O
'' O

But O
the O
other O
woman O
said O
, O
`` O
No O
! O

The O
dead O
baby O
is O
yours O
, O
and O
the O
one O
still O
alive O
is O
mine O
! O
'' O

But O
the O
first O
woman O
said O
, O
`` O
No O
, O
you O
are O
wrong O
! O

The O
dead O
baby O
is O
yours O
! O

The O
one O
that O
is O
still O
alive O
is O
mine O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
two O
women O
argued O
in O
front O
of O
the O
king O
. O

Then O
King O
Solomon O
said O
, O
`` O
Each O
of O
you O
says O
that O
the O
living O
baby O
is O
your O
own O
and O
that O
the O
dead O
baby O
belongs O
to O
the O
other O
woman O
. O
'' O

Then O
King O
Solomon O
sent O
his O
servant O
to O
get O
a O
sword O
. O

He O
told O
the O
servant O
, O
`` O
Cut O
the O
living O
baby O
in O
two O
and O
give O
one O
half O
of O
the O
baby O
to O
each O
woman O
. O
'' O

The O
second O
woman O
said O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
cut O
him O
in O
two O
. O

Then O
neither O
of O
us O
will O
have O
him O
. O
'' O

But O
the O
first O
woman O
, O
the O
real O
mother O
, O
loved O
her O
son O
and O
said O
to O
the O
king O
, O
`` O
Please O
, O
sir O
, O
do O
n't O
kill O
the O
baby O
! O

Give O
him O
to O
her O
. O
'' O

Then O
King O
Solomon O
said O
, O
`` O
Stop O
, O
do O
n't O
kill O
the O
baby O
. O

Give O
him O
to O
this O
woman O
. O

She O
is O
the O
real O
mother O
. O
'' O

The O
people O
of O
Israel O
respected O
the O
king O
when O
they O
heard O
about O
this O
decision O
. O

They O
saw O
he O
had O
the O
wisdom O
of O
God O
to O
make O
the O
right O
decisions O
. O

Elijah O
was O
a O
prophet O
from O
the O
town O
of O
Tishbe O
in O
Gilead O
. O

He O
said O
to O
King O
Ahab O
, O
`` O
I O
serve O
the O
Lord O
, O
the O
God O
of O
Israel O
. O

By O
his O
power O
, O
I O
promise O
that O
no O
dew O
or O
rain O
will O
fall O
for O
the O
next O
few O
years O
. O

The O
rain O
will O
fall O
only O
when O
I O
command O
it O
to O
fall O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
Lord O
said O
to O
Elijah O
, O
`` O
Leave O
this O
place O
and O
go O
east O
. O

Hide O
near O
Kerith O
Ravine O
, O
east O
of O
the O
Jordan O
River O
. O

You O
can O
get O
your O
water O
from O
that O
stream O
, O
and O
I O
have O
commanded O
ravens O
to O
bring O
food O
to O
you O
there O
. O
'' O

So O
Elijah O
did O
what O
the O
Lord O
told O
him O
to O
do O
. O

He O
went O
to O
live O
near O
Kerith O
Ravine O
, O
east O
of O
the O
Jordan O
River O
. O

Ravens O
brought O
Elijah O
food O
every O
morning O
and O
every O
evening O
, O
and O
he O
drank O
water O
from O
the O
stream O
. O

There O
was O
no O
rain O
, O
so O
after O
a O
while O
the O
stream O
became O
dry O
. O

Then O
the O
Lord O
said O
to O
Elijah O
, O
`` O
Go O
to O
Zarephath O
in O
Sidon O
and O
stay O
there O
. O

There O
is O
a O
widow O
there O
that O
I O
commanded O
to O
take O
care O
of O
you O
. O
'' O

So O
Elijah O
went O
to O
Zarephath O
. O

He O
went O
to O
the O
town O
gate O
and O
saw O
a O
woman O
there O
gathering O
wood O
for O
a O
fire O
. O

She O
was O
a O
widow O
. O

Elijah O
said O
to O
her O
, O
`` O
Would O
you O
bring O
me O
a O
small O
cup O
of O
water O
to O
drink O
? O
'' O

As O
she O
was O
going O
to O
get O
the O
water O
, O
Elijah O
said O
, O
`` O
Bring O
me O
a O
piece O
of O
bread O
too O
, O
please O
. O
'' O

The O
woman O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
promise O
you O
, O
before O
the O
Lord O
your O
God O
, O
that O
I O
have O
nothing O
but O
a O
handful O
of O
flour O
in O
a O
jar O
and O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
olive O
oil O
in O
a O
jug O
. O

I O
came O
here O
to O
gather O
a O
few O
pieces O
of O
wood O
for O
a O
fire O
to O
cook O
our O
last O
meal O
. O

My O
son O
and O
I O
will O
eat O
it O
and O
then O
die O
from O
hunger O
. O
'' O

Elijah O
said O
to O
the O
woman O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
worry O
. O

Go O
home O
and O
cook O
your O
food O
as O
you O
said O
. O

But O
first O
make O
a O
small O
piece O
of O
bread O
from O
the O
flour O
that O
you O
have O
and O
bring O
it O
to O
me O
. O

Then O
cook O
some O
for O
yourself O
and O
your O
son O
. O

The O
Lord O
, O
the O
God O
of O
Israel O
, O
says O
, O
' O
That O
jar O
of O
flour O
will O
never O
be O
empty O
and O
the O
jug O
will O
always O
have O
oil O
in O
it O
. O

This O
will O
continue O
until O
the O
day O
the O
Lord O
sends O
rain O
to O
the O
land O
. O
' O
'' O

So O
the O
woman O
went O
home O
and O
did O
what O
Elijah O
told O
her O
to O
do O
. O

And O
Elijah O
, O
the O
woman O
, O
and O
her O
son O
had O
enough O
food O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

The O
jar O
of O
flour O
and O
the O
jug O
of O
oil O
were O
never O
empty O
. O

This O
happened O
just O
as O
the O
Lord O
said O
through O
Elijah O
. O

Some O
time O
later O
the O
woman O
's O
son O
became O
sick O
. O

He O
became O
worse O
and O
worse O
until O
he O
stopped O
breathing O
. O

Then O
the O
woman O
said O
to O
Elijah O
, O
`` O
You O
are O
a O
man O
of O
God O
. O

Can O
you O
help O
me O
? O

Or O
did O
you O
come O
here O
only O
to O
remind O
me O
of O
my O
sins O
and O
to O
make O
my O
son O
die O
? O
'' O

Elijah O
said O
to O
her O
, O
`` O
Give O
me O
your O
son O
. O
'' O

He O
took O
the O
boy O
from O
her O
and O
carried O
him O
upstairs O
. O

He O
laid O
him O
on O
the O
bed O
in O
the O
room O
where O
he O
was O
staying O
. O

Then O
Elijah O
prayed O
, O
`` O
Lord O
my O
God O
, O
this O
widow O
is O
letting O
me O
stay O
in O
her O
house O
. O

Will O
you O
do O
this O
bad O
thing O
to O
her O
? O

Will O
you O
cause O
her O
son O
to O
die O
? O
'' O

Then O
Elijah O
lay O
on O
top O
of O
the O
boy O
three O
times O
. O

He O
prayed O
, O
`` O
Lord O
my O
God O
, O
let O
this O
boy O
live O
again O

The O
Lord O
answered O
Elijah O
's O
prayer O
. O

The O
boy O
began O
breathing O
again O
and O
was O
alive O
. O

Elijah O
carried O
the O
boy O
downstairs O
, O
gave O
him O
to O
his O
mother O
, O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Look O
, O
your O
son O
is O
alive O
! O
'' O

The O
woman O
answered O
, O
`` O
Now O
I O
know O
that O
you O
really O
are O
a O
man O
from O
God O
. O

I O
know O
that O
the O
Lord O
really O
speaks O
through O
you O
! O
'' O

Jeroboam O
son O
of O
Nebat O
was O
still O
in O
Egypt O
where O
he O
had O
run O
away O
from O
Solomon O
. O

When O
he O
heard O
about O
Solomon O
's O
death O
, O
he O
returned O
to O
his O
city O
, O
Zeredah O
, O
in O
the O
hills O
of O
Ephraim O
. O

Rehoboam O
and O
all O
the O
Israelites O
went O
to O
Shechem O
to O
make O
him O
the O
king O
. O

The O
people O
said O
to O
Rehoboam O
, O
`` O
Your O
father O
forced O
us O
to O
work O
very O
hard O
. O

Now O
, O
make O
it O
easier O
for O
us O
. O

Stop O
the O
heavy O
work O
that O
your O
father O
forced O
us O
to O
do O
and O
we O
will O
serve O
you O
. O
'' O

Rehoboam O
answered O
, O
`` O
Come O
back O
to O
me O
in O
three O
days O
, O
and O
I O
will O
answer O
you O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
people O
left O
. O

There O
were O
some O
older O
men O
who O
had O
helped O
Solomon O
make O
decisions O
when O
he O
was O
alive O
. O

So O
King O
Rehoboam O
asked O
these O
men O
what O
he O
should O
do O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
How O
do O
you O
think O
I O
should O
answer O
the O
people O
? O
'' O

They O
answered O
, O
`` O
If O
you O
are O
like O
a O
servant O
to O
them O
today O
, O
they O
will O
sincerely O
serve O
you O
. O

If O
you O
speak O
kindly O
to O
them O
, O
they O
will O
always O
work O
for O
you O
. O
'' O

But O
Rehoboam O
did O
not O
listen O
to O
the O
advice O
from O
the O
older O
men O
. O

He O
asked O
the O
young O
men O
who O
were O
his O
friends O
. O

Rehoboam O
asked O
them O
, O
`` O
The O
people O
said O
, O
' O
Give O
us O
easier O
work O
than O
your O
father O
gave O
us O
. O
' O

How O
do O
you O
think O
I O
should O
answer O
them O
? O

What O
should O
I O
tell O
them O
? O
'' O

Then O
the O
young O
men O
who O
grew O
up O
with O
him O
answered O
, O
`` O
Those O
people O
came O
to O
you O
and O
said O
, O
' O
Your O
father O
forced O
us O
to O
work O
very O
hard O
. O

Now O
make O
our O
work O
easier O
. O
' O

So O
you O
should O
tell O
them O
, O
' O
My O
little O
finger O
is O
stronger O
than O
my O
father O
's O
whole O
body O
. O

My O
father O
forced O
you O
to O
work O
hard O
, O
but O
I O
will O
make O
you O
work O
much O
harder O
! O

My O
father O
punished O
you O
with O
whips O
, O
but O
I O
will O
punish O
you O
with O
whips O
that O
have O
sharp O
metal O
tips O
. O
' O
'' O

Three O
days O
later O
, O
Jeroboam O
and O
all O
the O
people O
came O
back O
as O
Rehoboam O
had O
said O
. O

King O
Rehoboam O
did O
not O
listen O
to O
the O
advice O
from O
the O
older O
men O
, O
and O
he O
was O
rude O
to O
the O
people O
. O

He O
did O
what O
his O
friends O
told O
him O
to O
do O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
My O
father O
forced O
you O
to O
work O
hard O
, O
but O
I O
will O
make O
you O
work O
much O
harder O
! O

My O
father O
punished O
you O
with O
whips O
, O
but O
I O
will O
punish O
you O
with O
whips O
that O
have O
sharp O
metal O
tips O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
king O
did O
not O
do O
what O
the O
people O
wanted O
. O

The O
Lord O
caused O
this O
to O
happen O
. O

He O
did O
this O
in O
order O
to O
keep O
the O
promise O
he O
made O
to O
Jeroboam O
son O
of O
Nebat O
when O
he O
sent O
the O
prophet O
Ahijah O
from O
Shiloh O
to O
speak O
to O
him O
. O

The O
Israelites O
saw O
that O
the O
new O
king O
refused O
to O
listen O
to O
them O
, O
so O
they O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
We O
are O
not O
part O
of O
David O
's O
family O
are O
we O
? O

We O
do O
n't O
get O
any O
of O
Jesse O
's O
land O
, O
do O
we O
? O

So O
, O
people O
of O
Israel O
, O
let O
's O
go O
home O
and O
let O
David O
's O
son O
rule O
his O
own O
people O
! O
'' O

So O
the O
Israelites O
went O
home O
. O

But O
Rehoboam O
still O
ruled O
over O
the O
Israelites O
who O
lived O
in O
the O
cities O
of O
Judah O
. O

A O
man O
named O
Adoniram O
was O
one O
of O
the O
men O
who O
directed O
the O
workers O
. O

King O
Rehoboam O
sent O
Adoniram O
to O
talk O
to O
the O
people O
, O
but O
the O
Israelites O
threw O
stones O
at O
him O
until O
he O
died O
. O

King O
Rehoboam O
ran O
to O
his O
chariot O
and O
escaped O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

So O
Israel O
rebelled O
against O
the O
family O
of O
David O
, O
and O
this O
is O
how O
things O
are O
even O
today O
. O

When O
all O
the O
Israelites O
heard O
that O
Jeroboam O
had O
come O
back O
, O
they O
called O
him O
to O
a O
meeting O
and O
made O
him O
king O
over O
all O
Israel O
. O

The O
tribe O
of O
Judah O
was O
the O
only O
tribe O
that O
continued O
to O
follow O
the O
family O
of O
David O
. O

Rehoboam O
went O
back O
to O
Jerusalem O
and O
gathered O
together O
an O
army O
of O
180,000 O
men O
from O
the O
families O
of O
Judah O
and O
the O
tribe O
of O
Benjamin O
. O

Rehoboam O
wanted O
to O
go O
fight O
against O
the O
Israelites O
and O
take O
back O
his O
kingdom O
. O

But O
the O
Lord O
spoke O
to O
a O
man O
of O
God O
named O
Shemaiah O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Talk O
to O
Rehoboam O
, O
the O
son O
of O
Solomon O
, O
king O
of O
Judah O
, O
and O
to O
men O
of O
Judah O
and O
Benjamin O
. O

Say O
to O
them O
, O
' O
The O
Lord O
says O
that O
you O
must O
not O
go O
to O
war O
against O
your O
brothers O
. O

Everyone O
, O
go O
home O
! O

I O
made O
all O
this O
happen O
. O
' O
'' O

So O
all O
the O
men O
in O
Rehoboam O
's O
army O
obeyed O
the O
Lord O
and O
went O
home O
. O

Jeroboam O
rebuilt O
the O
city O
of O
Shechem O
, O
in O
the O
hill O
country O
of O
Ephraim O
, O
and O
lived O
there O
. O

Later O
he O
went O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Penuel O
and O
rebuilt O
it O
. O

Jeroboam O
said O
to O
himself O
, O
`` O
If O
the O
people O
keep O
going O
to O
Jerusalem O
to O
offer O
sacrifices O
at O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
, O
someday O
they O
will O
want O
to O
be O
ruled O
by O
their O
old O
masters O
. O

They O
will O
want O
to O
be O
ruled O
by O
King O
Rehoboam O
of O
Judah O
. O

And O
then O
they O
will O
kill O
me O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
king O
asked O
his O
advisors O
what O
to O
do O
. O

They O
gave O
him O
their O
advice O
, O
and O
King O
Jeroboam O
made O
two O
golden O
calves O
. O

He O
said O
to O
the O
people O
, O
`` O
You O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
go O
to O
Jerusalem O
to O
worship O
anymore O
. O

Israel O
, O
these O
are O
the O
gods O
that O
brought O
you O
out O
of O
Egypt O
. O
'' O

King O
Jeroboam O
put O
one O
golden O
calf O
in O
Bethel O
and O
the O
other O
one O
in O
the O
city O
of O
Dan O
. O

What O
a O
terrible O
sin O
this O
was O
, O
because O
the O
Israelites O
started O
going O
to O
the O
cities O
of O
Dan O
and O
Bethel O
to O
worship O
the O
calves O
. O

Jeroboam O
also O
built O
temples O
at O
the O
high O
places O
and O
chose O
priests O
from O
among O
the O
different O
tribes O
of O
Israel O
. O

-LRB- O
He O
did O
not O
choose O
priests O
only O
from O
the O
tribe O
of O
Levi O
. O
-RRB- O

Then O
King O
Jeroboam O
started O
a O
new O
festival O
that O
was O
like O
the O
festival O
in O
Judah O
, O
but O
it O
was O
on O
the O
15th O
day O
of O
the O
eighth O
month O
. O

At O
this O
time O
the O
king O
offered O
sacrifices O
on O
the O
altar O
at O
Bethel O
. O

He O
and O
the O
priests O
he O
chose O
offered O
the O
sacrifices O
to O
the O
calves O
that O
he O
had O
set O
up O
at O
the O
high O
places O
he O
had O
made O
. O

So O
King O
Jeroboam O
chose O
his O
own O
time O
for O
a O
festival O
for O
the O
Israelites O
, O
the O
15th O
day O
of O
the O
eighth O
month O
. O

And O
during O
that O
time O
he O
offered O
sacrifices O
and O
burned O
incense O
on O
the O
altar O
he O
had O
built O
at O
Bethel O
. O

Ahaz O
son O
of O
Jotham O
became O
king O
of O
Judah O
during O
the O
17th O
year O
that O
Pekah O
son O
of O
Remaliah O
was O
king O
of O
Israel O
. O

Ahaz O
was O
20 O
years O
old O
when O
he O
became O
king O
. O

He O
ruled O
16 O
years O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

Unlike O
his O
ancestor O
David O
, O
Ahaz O
did O
not O
do O
what O
the O
Lord O
said O
was O
right O
. O

He O
did O
the O
same O
bad O
things O
the O
kings O
of O
Israel O
had O
done O
. O

He O
even O
burned O
his O
son O
as O
a O
sacrifice O
. O

He O
copied O
the O
terrible O
sins O
of O
the O
nations O
that O
the O
Lord O
had O
forced O
to O
leave O
the O
country O
when O
the O
Israelites O
came O
. O

Ahaz O
made O
sacrifices O
and O
burned O
incense O
at O
the O
high O
places O
and O
on O
the O
hills O
and O
under O
every O
green O
tree O
. O

King O
Rezin O
of O
Aram O
and O
King O
Pekah O
son O
of O
Remaliah O
of O
Israel O
came O
to O
fight O
against O
Jerusalem O
. O

Rezin O
and O
Pekah O
surrounded O
Ahaz O
, O
but O
could O
not O
defeat O
him O
. O

At O
that O
time O
King O
Rezin O
of O
Aram O
took O
back O
Elath O
for O
Aram O
. O

Rezin O
took O
all O
the O
people O
of O
Judah O
who O
were O
living O
in O
Elath O
. O

The O
Arameans O
settled O
in O
Elath O
, O
and O
they O
still O
live O
there O
today O
. O

Ahaz O
sent O
messengers O
to O
King O
Tiglath O
Pileser O
of O
Assyria O
with O
this O
message O
: O
`` O
I O
am O
your O
servant O
. O

I O
am O
like O
a O
son O
to O
you O
. O

Come O
and O
save O
me O
from O
the O
king O
of O
Aram O
and O
the O
king O
of O
Israel O
. O

They O
have O
come O
to O
fight O
me O
. O
'' O

Ahaz O
also O
took O
the O
silver O
and O
gold O
that O
was O
in O
the O
Temple O
of O
the O
Lord O
and O
in O
the O
treasuries O
of O
the O
king O
's O
palace O
. O

Then O
Ahaz O
sent O
a O
gift O
to O
the O
king O
of O
Assyria O
. O

The O
king O
of O
Assyria O
listened O
to O
Ahaz O
and O
went O
to O
fight O
against O
Damascus O
. O

The O
king O
captured O
that O
city O
and O
took O
the O
people O
from O
Damascus O
as O
prisoners O
to O
Kir O
. O

He O
also O
killed O
Rezin O
. O

King O
Ahaz O
went O
to O
Damascus O
to O
meet O
King O
Tiglath O
Pileser O
of O
Assyria O
. O

Ahaz O
saw O
the O
altar O
at O
Damascus O
. O

He O
sent O
a O
model O
and O
pattern O
of O
this O
altar O
to O
Uriah O
the O
priest O
. O

Then O
Uriah O
the O
priest O
built O
an O
altar O
just O
like O
the O
model O
King O
Ahaz O
had O
sent O
him O
from O
Damascus O
. O

Uriah O
the O
priest O
built O
the O
altar O
this O
way O
before O
King O
Ahaz O
came O
back O
from O
Damascus O
. O

When O
the O
king O
arrived O
from O
Damascus O
, O
he O
saw O
the O
altar O
. O

He O
offered O
sacrifices O
on O
the O
altar O
. O

Ahaz O
burned O
his O
burnt O
offerings O
and O
grain O
offerings O
on O
it O
. O

He O
poured O
his O
drink O
offering O
and O
sprinkled O
the O
blood O
of O
his O
fellowship O
offerings O
on O
this O
altar O
. O

Ahaz O
took O
the O
bronze O
altar O
that O
was O
before O
the O
Lord O
from O
the O
front O
of O
the O
Temple O
. O

This O
bronze O
altar O
was O
between O
Ahaz O
's O
altar O
and O
the O
Temple O
of O
the O
Lord O
. O

Ahaz O
put O
the O
bronze O
altar O
on O
the O
north O
side O
of O
his O
own O
altar O
. O

He O
commanded O
Uriah O
the O
priest O
, O
`` O
Use O
the O
large O
altar O
to O
burn O
the O
morning O
burnt O
offerings O
, O
the O
evening O
grain O
offerings O
, O
and O
the O
drink O
offerings O
from O
all O
the O
people O
of O
this O
country O
. O

Sprinkle O
all O
the O
blood O
from O
the O
burnt O
offering O
and O
other O
sacrifices O
on O
the O
large O
altar O
. O

But O
I O
will O
use O
the O
bronze O
altar O
to O
get O
answers O
from O
God O
. O
'' O

Uriah O
the O
priest O
did O
everything O
that O
King O
Ahaz O
commanded O
him O
to O
do O
. O

In O
the O
time O
of O
Jehoiakim O
, O
King O
Nebuchadnezzar O
of O
Babylon O
came O
to O
the O
country O
of O
Judah O
. O

Jehoiakim O
served O
Nebuchadnezzar O
for O
three O
years O
. O

Then O
Jehoiakim O
turned O
against O
Nebuchadnezzar O
and O
broke O
away O
from O
his O
rule O
. O

The O
Lord O
sent O
groups O
of O
Babylonians O
, O
Arameans O
, O
Moabites O
, O
and O
Ammonites O
to O
fight O
against O
Jehoiakim O
. O

He O
sent O
them O
to O
destroy O
Judah O
. O

This O
happened O
just O
as O
the O
Lord O
had O
said O
. O

He O
used O
his O
servants O
the O
prophets O
to O
say O
those O
things O
. O

The O
Lord O
commanded O
this O
to O
happen O
to O
Judah O
. O

In O
this O
way O
he O
would O
remove O
them O
from O
his O
sight O
. O

He O
did O
this O
because O
of O
all O
the O
sins O
that O
Manasseh O
committed O
. O

He O
did O
this O
because O
Manasseh O
killed O
many O
innocent O
people O
and O
filled O
Jerusalem O
with O
their O
blood O
. O

The O
Lord O
would O
not O
forgive O
these O
sins O
. O

The O
other O
things O
that O
Jehoiakim O
did O
are O
written O
in O
the O
book O
, O
The O
History O
of O
the O
Kings O
of O
Judah O
. O

Jehoiakim O
died O
and O
was O
buried O
with O
his O
ancestors O
. O

His O
son O
Jehoiachin O
became O
the O
new O
king O
after O
him O
. O

The O
king O
of O
Babylon O
captured O
all O
the O
land O
between O
the O
Brook O
of O
Egypt O
and O
the O
Euphrates O
River O
. O

This O
land O
was O
previously O
controlled O
by O
Egypt O
. O

So O
the O
king O
of O
Egypt O
did O
not O
leave O
Egypt O
anymore O
. O

Jehoiachin O
was O
18 O
years O
old O
when O
he O
began O
to O
rule O
. O

He O
ruled O
three O
months O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

His O
mother O
's O
name O
was O
Nehushta O
daughter O
of O
Elnathan O
from O
Jerusalem O
. O

Jehoiachin O
did O
what O
the O
Lord O
said O
was O
wrong O
. O

He O
did O
all O
the O
same O
things O
that O
his O
father O
had O
done O
. O

At O
that O
time O
the O
officers O
of O
King O
Nebuchadnezzar O
of O
Babylon O
came O
to O
Jerusalem O
and O
surrounded O
it O
. O

Then O
King O
Nebuchadnezzar O
of O
Babylon O
came O
to O
the O
city O
. O

King O
Jehoiachin O
of O
Judah O
went O
out O
to O
meet O
the O
king O
of O
Babylon O
. O

His O
mother O
, O
his O
officers O
, O
leaders O
, O
and O
officials O
also O
went O
with O
him O
. O

Then O
the O
king O
of O
Babylon O
captured O
Jehoiachin O
. O

This O
was O
during O
the O
eighth O
year O
of O
Nebuchadnezzar O
's O
rule O
. O

Nebuchadnezzar O
took O
from O
Jerusalem O
all O
the O
treasures O
in O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
and O
all O
the O
treasures O
in O
the O
king O
's O
palace O
. O

He O
cut O
up O
all O
the O
golden O
dishes O
that O
King O
Solomon O
of O
Israel O
had O
put O
in O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
. O

This O
happened O
just O
as O
the O
Lord O
had O
said O
. O

Nebuchadnezzar O
captured O
all O
the O
people O
of O
Jerusalem O
, O
including O
the O
leaders O
and O
other O
wealthy O
people O
. O

He O
took O
10,000 O
people O
and O
made O
them O
prisoners O
. O

He O
took O
all O
the O
skilled O
workers O
and O
craftsmen O
. O

No O
one O
was O
left O
, O
except O
the O
poorest O
of O
the O
common O
people O
. O

Nebuchadnezzar O
took O
Jehoiachin O
to O
Babylon O
as O
a O
prisoner O
. O

He O
also O
took O
the O
king O
's O
mother O
, O
his O
wives O
, O
officers O
, O
and O
the O
leading O
men O
of O
the O
land O
. O

He O
took O
them O
from O
Jerusalem O
to O
Babylon O
as O
prisoners O
. O

There O
were O
7000 O
soldiers O
. O

Nebuchadnezzar O
took O
all O
the O
soldiers O
and O
1000 O
of O
the O
skilled O
workers O
and O
craftsmen O
. O

All O
these O
men O
were O
trained O
soldiers O
, O
ready O
for O
war O
. O

The O
king O
of O
Babylon O
took O
them O
to O
Babylon O
as O
prisoners O
. O

The O
king O
of O
Babylon O
made O
Mattaniah O
the O
new O
king O
. O

Mattaniah O
was O
Jehoiachin O
's O
uncle O
. O

He O
changed O
his O
name O
to O
Zedekiah O
. O

Zedekiah O
was O
21 O
years O
old O
when O
he O
began O
to O
rule O
. O

He O
ruled O
11 O
years O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

His O
mother O
's O
name O
was O
Hamutal O
daughter O
of O
Jeremiah O
from O
Libnah O
. O

Zedekiah O
did O
what O
the O
Lord O
said O
was O
wrong O
. O

He O
did O
all O
the O
same O
things O
that O
Jehoiakim O
did O
. O

The O
Lord O
became O
so O
angry O
with O
Jerusalem O
and O
Judah O
that O
he O
threw O
them O
away O
. O

Zedekiah O
rebelled O
and O
refused O
to O
obey O
the O
king O
of O
Babylon O
. O

After O
King O
Ahab O
died O
, O
Moab O
broke O
away O
from O
Israel O
's O
rule O
. O

One O
day O
Ahaziah O
was O
on O
the O
roof O
of O
his O
house O
in O
Samaria O
. O

He O
fell O
down O
through O
the O
wooden O
bars O
on O
top O
of O
his O
house O
and O
was O
badly O
hurt O
. O

He O
called O
messengers O
and O
told O
them O
, O
`` O
Go O
to O
the O
priests O
of O
Baal O
Zebub O
, O
the O
god O
of O
Ekron O
, O
and O
ask O
them O
if O
I O
will O
get O
well O
from O
my O
injuries O
. O
'' O

But O
the O
Lord O
's O
angel O
said O
to O
Elijah O
the O
Tishbite O
, O
`` O
King O
Ahaziah O
has O
sent O
some O
messengers O
from O
Samaria O
. O

Go O
meet O
those O
men O
and O
ask O
them O
, O
' O
There O
is O
a O
God O
in O
Israel O
, O
so O
why O
are O
you O
men O
going O
to O
ask O
questions O
of O
Baal O
Zebub O
, O
the O
god O
of O
Ekron O
? O

Since O
you O
did O
this O
, O
the O
Lord O
says O
, O
You O
will O
not O
get O
up O
from O
your O
bed O
. O

You O
will O
die O
! O
' O
'' O

Then O
Elijah O
left O
. O

When O
messengers O
came O
back O
to O
Ahaziah O
, O
he O
asked O
them O
, O
`` O
Why O
did O
you O
come O
back O
so O
soon O
? O
'' O

The O
messengers O
said O
to O
Ahaziah O
, O
`` O
A O
man O
came O
up O
to O
meet O
us O
and O
told O
us O
to O
go O
back O
to O
the O
king O
who O
sent O
us O
and O
tell O
him O
what O
the O
Lord O
says O
: O
' O
There O
is O
a O
God O
in O
Israel O
, O
so O
why O
did O
you O
send O
messengers O
to O
ask O
questions O
of O
Baal O
Zebub O
, O
the O
god O
of O
Ekron O
? O

Since O
you O
did O
this O
, O
you O
will O
not O
get O
up O
from O
your O
bed O
. O

You O
will O
die O
! O
' O
'' O

Ahaziah O
said O
to O
the O
messengers O
, O
`` O
What O
did O
the O
man O
look O
like O
who O
met O
you O
and O
told O
you O
this O
? O
'' O

They O
answered O
Ahaziah O
, O
`` O
This O
man O
was O
wearing O
a O
hairy O
coat O
with O
a O
leather O
belt O
around O
his O
waist O
. O
'' O

Then O
Ahaziah O
said O
, O
`` O
That O
was O
Elijah O
the O
Tishbite O
. O
'' O

Ahaziah O
sent O
a O
captain O
and O
50 O
men O
to O
Elijah O
. O

The O
captain O
went O
to O
Elijah O
, O
who O
was O
sitting O
on O
top O
of O
a O
hill O
. O

The O
captain O
said O
to O
Elijah O
, O
`` O
Man O
of O
God O
, O
the O
king O
says O
, O
' O
Come O
down O
! O
' O
'' O

Elijah O
answered O
the O
captain O
of O
50 O
, O
`` O
If O
I O
am O
a O
man O
of O
God O
, O
let O
fire O
come O
down O
from O
heaven O
and O
destroy O
you O
and O
your O
50 O
men O
! O
'' O

So O
fire O
came O
down O
from O
heaven O
and O
destroyed O
the O
captain O
and O
his O
50 O
men O
. O

Ahaziah O
sent O
another O
captain O
with O
50 O
men O
to O
Elijah O
. O

He O
said O
to O
Elijah O
, O
`` O
Man O
of O
God O
, O
the O
king O
says O
, O
' O
Come O
down O
quickly O
! O
' O
'' O

Elijah O
told O
the O
captain O
and O
his O
50 O
men O
, O
`` O
If O
I O
am O
a O
man O
of O
God O
, O
let O
fire O
come O
down O
from O
heaven O
and O
destroy O
you O
and O
your O
50 O
men O
! O
'' O

Then O
God O
's O
fire O
came O
down O
from O
heaven O
and O
destroyed O
the O
captain O
and O
his O
50 O
men O
. O

Ahaziah O
sent O
a O
third O
captain O
with O
50 O
men O
. O

The O
third O
captain O
came O
to O
Elijah O
. O

He O
fell O
down O
on O
his O
knees O
and O
begged O
Elijah O
, O
saying O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Man O
of O
God O
, O
I O
ask O
you O
, O
please O
let O
my O
life O
and O
the O
lives O
of O
your O
50 O
servants O
be O
valuable O
to O
you O
. O

Fire O
came O
down O
from O
heaven O
and O
destroyed O
the O
first O
two O
captains O
and O
their O
50 O
men O
. O

But O
now O
, O
have O
mercy O
and O
let O
us O
live O
! O
'' O

The O
Lord O
's O
angel O
said O
to O
Elijah O
, O
`` O
Go O
with O
the O
captain O
. O

Do O
n't O
be O
afraid O
of O
him O
. O
'' O

So O
Elijah O
went O
with O
the O
captain O
to O
see O
King O
Ahaziah O
. O

Elijah O
told O
Ahaziah O
, O
`` O
This O
is O
what O
the O
Lord O
says O
: O
' O
There O
is O
a O
God O
in O
Israel O
, O
so O
why O
did O
you O
send O
messengers O
to O
ask O
questions O
of O
Baal O
Zebub O
, O
the O
god O
of O
Ekron O
? O

Since O
you O
did O
this O
, O
you O
will O
not O
get O
up O
from O
your O
bed O
. O

You O
will O
die O
! O
' O
'' O

Ahaziah O
died O
, O
just O
as O
the O
Lord O
said O
through O
Elijah O
. O

Ahaziah O
did O
not O
have O
a O
son O
, O
so O
Joram O
became O
the O
new O
king O
after O
Ahaziah O
. O

He O
began O
to O
rule O
during O
the O
second O
year O
that O
Jehoram O
son O
of O
Jehoshaphat O
was O
the O
king O
of O
Judah O
. O

The O
other O
things O
that O
Ahaziah O
did O
are O
written O
in O
the O
book O
, O
The O
History O
of O
the O
Kings O
of O
Israel O
. O

Joash O
began O
to O
rule O
during O
Jehu O
's O
seventh O
year O
as O
king O
of O
Israel O
. O

Joash O
ruled O
40 O
years O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

His O
mother O
was O
named O
Zibiah O
of O
Beersheba O
. O

Joash O
did O
what O
the O
Lord O
said O
was O
right O
. O

He O
obeyed O
the O
Lord O
all O
his O
life O
. O

He O
did O
what O
Jehoiada O
the O
priest O
taught O
him O
, O
but O
he O
did O
not O
destroy O
the O
high O
places O
. O

The O
people O
still O
made O
sacrifices O
and O
burned O
incense O
at O
those O
places O
of O
worship O
. O

Joash O
said O
to O
the O
priests O
, O
`` O
There O
is O
much O
money O
in O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
. O

People O
have O
given O
things O
to O
the O
Temple O
and O
have O
paid O
the O
Temple O
tax O
when O
they O
were O
counted O
. O

And O
they O
have O
given O
money O
simply O
because O
they O
wanted O
to O
. O

You O
priests O
should O
take O
that O
money O
and O
repair O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
. O

Each O
priest O
should O
use O
the O
money O
he O
gets O
from O
the O
people O
he O
serves O
. O

He O
should O
use O
that O
money O
to O
repair O
the O
damage O
to O
the O
Temple O
. O
'' O

In O
the O
23rd O
year O
that O
Joash O
was O
king O
, O
the O
priests O
still O
had O
not O
repaired O
the O
Temple O
, O
so O
King O
Joash O
called O
for O
Jehoiada O
the O
priest O
and O
the O
other O
priests O
. O

Joash O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Why O
have O
n't O
you O
repaired O
the O
Temple O
? O

Stop O
taking O
money O
from O
the O
people O
you O
serve O
. O

That O
money O
must O
be O
used O
to O
repair O
the O
Temple O
. O
'' O

The O
priests O
agreed O
to O
stop O
taking O
money O
from O
the O
people O
, O
but O
they O
also O
decided O
not O
to O
repair O
the O
Temple O
. O

So O
Jehoiada O
the O
priest O
took O
a O
box O
and O
made O
a O
hole O
in O
the O
top O
of O
it O
. O

Then O
Jehoiada O
put O
the O
box O
on O
the O
south O
side O
of O
the O
altar O
. O

This O
box O
was O
by O
the O
door O
where O
people O
came O
into O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
priests O
guarded O
the O
doorway O
of O
the O
Temple O
. O

They O
took O
the O
money O
people O
had O
given O
to O
the O
Lord O
, O
and O
they O
put O
that O
money O
into O
that O
box O
. O

Whenever O
the O
king O
's O
secretary O
and O
the O
high O
priest O
saw O
there O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
in O
the O
box O
, O
they O
came O
and O
took O
the O
money O
from O
the O
box O
. O

They O
put O
the O
money O
in O
bags O
and O
counted O
it O
. O

Then O
they O
paid O
the O
workers O
who O
worked O
on O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
. O

They O
paid O
the O
carpenters O
and O
other O
builders O
who O
worked O
on O
the O
Temple O
. O

They O
used O
that O
money O
to O
pay O
the O
stoneworkers O
and O
stonecutters O
, O
and O
they O
used O
it O
to O
buy O
timber O
, O
cut O
stone O
, O
and O
everything O
else O
to O
repair O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
. O

People O
gave O
money O
for O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
, O
but O
the O
priests O
could O
not O
use O
that O
money O
to O
make O
silver O
cups O
, O
snuffers O
, O
basins O
, O
trumpets O
, O
or O
any O
gold O
and O
silver O
dishes O
. O

That O
money O
was O
used O
to O
pay O
the O
workers O
who O
repaired O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
. O

No O
one O
counted O
all O
the O
money O
or O
forced O
the O
workers O
to O
tell O
what O
happened O
to O
the O
money O
, O
because O
those O
workers O
could O
be O
trusted O
. O

People O
gave O
money O
when O
they O
offered O
guilt O
offerings O
and O
sin O
offerings O
, O
but O
that O
money O
was O
not O
used O
to O
pay O
the O
workers O
. O

It O
belonged O
to O
the O
priests O
. O

Hazael O
was O
the O
king O
of O
Aram O
. O

He O
went O
to O
fight O
against O
the O
city O
of O
Gath O
and O
defeated O
it O
. O

Then O
he O
made O
plans O
to O
go O
fight O
against O
Jerusalem O
. O

Jehoshaphat O
, O
Jehoram O
, O
and O
Ahaziah O
had O
been O
kings O
of O
Judah O
. O

They O
were O
Joash O
's O
ancestors O
. O

They O
had O
given O
many O
things O
to O
the O
Lord O
that O
were O
kept O
in O
the O
Temple O
. O

Joash O
also O
had O
given O
many O
things O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

He O
took O
all O
these O
things O
and O
all O
the O
gold O
that O
was O
in O
the O
Temple O
and O
in O
his O
palace O
. O

Joash O
sent O
all O
these O
expensive O
things O
to O
King O
Hazael O
of O
Aram O
, O
so O
the O
king O
and O
his O
army O
left O
Jerusalem O
. O

All O
the O
great O
things O
that O
Joash O
did O
are O
written O
in O
the O
book O
, O
The O
History O
of O
the O
Kings O
of O
Judah O
. O

Joash O
's O
officers O
made O
plans O
against O
him O
. O

They O
killed O
Joash O
at O
the O
house O
of O
Millo O
on O
the O
road O
that O
goes O
down O
to O
Silla O
. O

Jozabad O
son O
of O
Shimeath O
and O
Jehozabad O
son O
of O
Shomer O
were O
Joash O
's O
officers O
. O

These O
men O
killed O
Joash O
. O

The O
people O
buried O
Joash O
with O
his O
ancestors O
in O
the O
City O
of O
David O
. O

His O
son O
Amaziah O
became O
the O
new O
king O
after O
him O
. O

Joram O
son O
of O
Ahab O
became O
king O
over O
Israel O
at O
Samaria O
. O

He O
began O
to O
rule O
during O
Jehoshaphat O
's O
18th O
year O
as O
king O
of O
Judah O
. O

Joram O
ruled O
12 O
years O
. O

He O
did O
what O
the O
Lord O
said O
was O
wrong O
. O

But O
he O
was O
not O
like O
his O
father O
and O
mother O
, O
because O
he O
removed O
the O
pillar O
that O
his O
father O
had O
made O
for O
worshiping O
Baal O
. O

But O
he O
continued O
to O
do O
the O
sins O
of O
Jeroboam O
son O
of O
Nebat O
who O
had O
caused O
the O
Israelites O
to O
sin O
. O

Joram O
did O
not O
stop O
committing O
the O
sins O
of O
Jeroboam O
. O

Mesha O
was O
the O
king O
of O
Moab O
. O

He O
owned O
many O
sheep O
. O

He O
gave O
the O
wool O
of O
100,000 O
lambs O
and O
100,000 O
rams O
to O
the O
king O
of O
Israel O
. O

But O
when O
Ahab O
died O
, O
the O
king O
of O
Moab O
broke O
away O
from O
the O
rule O
of O
the O
king O
of O
Israel O
. O

Then O
King O
Joram O
went O
out O
of O
Samaria O
and O
gathered O
together O
all O
the O
men O
of O
Israel O
. O

Joram O
sent O
messengers O
to O
Jehoshaphat O
, O
the O
king O
of O
Judah O
. O

Joram O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
king O
of O
Moab O
has O
broken O
away O
from O
my O
rule O
. O

Will O
you O
go O
with O
me O
to O
fight O
against O
Moab O
? O
'' O

Jehoshaphat O
said O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
I O
will O
go O
with O
you O
. O

We O
will O
join O
together O
as O
one O
army O
. O

My O
people O
will O
be O
like O
your O
people O
, O
and O
my O
horses O
will O
be O
like O
your O
horses O
. O
'' O

Jehoshaphat O
asked O
Joram O
, O
`` O
Which O
way O
should O
we O
go O
? O
'' O

Joram O
answered O
, O
`` O
We O
should O
go O
through O
the O
Desert O
of O
Edom O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
king O
of O
Israel O
went O
with O
the O
king O
of O
Judah O
and O
the O
king O
of O
Edom O
. O

They O
traveled O
around O
for O
seven O
days O
. O

There O
was O
not O
enough O
water O
for O
the O
army O
or O
for O
their O
animals O
. O

Finally O
the O
king O
of O
Israel O
said O
, O
`` O
Oh O
, O
I O
think O
the O
Lord O
really O
brought O
us O
three O
kings O
together O
only O
to O
let O
the O
Moabites O
defeat O
us O
! O
'' O

But O
Jehoshaphat O
said O
, O
`` O
Surely O
one O
of O
the O
Lord O
's O
prophets O
is O
here O
. O

Let O
's O
ask O
the O
prophet O
what O
the O
Lord O
says O
we O
should O
do O
. O
'' O

One O
of O
the O
servants O
of O
the O
king O
of O
Israel O
said O
, O
`` O
Elisha O
son O
of O
Shaphat O
is O
here O
. O

Elisha O
was O
Elijah O
's O
servant O
. O
'' O

Jehoshaphat O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
Lord O
's O
word O
is O
with O
Elisha O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
king O
of O
Israel O
, O
Jehoshaphat O
, O
and O
the O
king O
of O
Edom O
went O
down O
to O
see O
Elisha O
. O

Elisha O
said O
to O
the O
king O
of O
Israel O
, O
`` O
What O
do O
you O
want O
from O
me O
? O

Go O
to O
the O
prophets O
of O
your O
father O
and O
mother O
. O
'' O

The O
king O
of O
Israel O
said O
to O
Elisha O
, O
`` O
No O
, O
we O
have O
come O
to O
see O
you O
because O
the O
Lord O
called O
us O
three O
kings O
together O
to O
let O
the O
Moabites O
defeat O
us O
. O
'' O

Elisha O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
respect O
King O
Jehoshaphat O
of O
Judah O
, O
and O
I O
serve O
the O
Lord O
All-Powerful O
. O

As O
surely O
as O
he O
lives O
, O
I O
came O
here O
only O
because O
of O
Jehoshaphat O
. O

I O
tell O
you O
the O
truth O
, O
if O
he O
were O
not O
here O
, O
I O
would O
not O
pay O
any O
attention O
to O
you O
. O

I O
would O
ignore O
you O
completely O
. O

But O
now O
bring O
me O
someone O
who O
plays O
the O
harp O
. O
'' O

When O
the O
person O
played O
the O
harp O
, O
the O
Lord O
's O
power O
came O
on O
Elisha O
. O

Then O
Elisha O
said O
, O
`` O
This O
is O
what O
the O
Lord O
says O
: O
' O
Dig O
holes O
in O
the O
valley O
. O
' O

Yes O
, O
this O
is O
what O
the O
Lord O
says O
: O
' O
You O
will O
not O
see O
wind O
or O
rain O
, O
but O
that O
valley O
will O
be O
filled O
with O
water O
. O

Then O
you O
and O
your O
cattle O
and O
other O
animals O
will O
have O
water O
to O
drink O
. O
' O

This O
is O
an O
easy O
thing O
for O
the O
Lord O
to O
do O
. O

He O
will O
also O
help O
you O
defeat O
the O
Moabites O
. O

You O
will O
attack O
every O
strong O
city O
and O
every O
good O
city O
. O

You O
will O
cut O
down O
every O
good O
tree O
. O

You O
will O
stop O
up O
all O
the O
springs O
of O
water O
. O

You O
will O
ruin O
every O
good O
field O
with O
stones O
. O
'' O

In O
the O
morning O
, O
at O
the O
time O
for O
the O
morning O
sacrifice O
, O
water O
began O
flowing O
from O
the O
direction O
of O
Edom O
and O
filled O
the O
valley O
. O

The O
Moabites O
heard O
that O
the O
kings O
had O
come O
up O
to O
fight O
against O
them O
. O

So O
they O
gathered O
together O
all O
the O
men O
old O
enough O
to O
wear O
armor O
and O
waited O
at O
the O
border O
. O

The O
Moabites O
got O
up O
early O
that O
morning O
. O

The O
rising O
sun O
was O
shining O
on O
the O
water O
in O
the O
valley O
, O
and O
it O
looked O
like O
blood O
to O
the O
Moabites O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Look O
at O
the O
blood O
! O

The O
kings O
must O
have O
fought O
against O
each O
other O
. O

They O
must O
have O
destroyed O
each O
other O
. O

Let O
's O
go O
take O
the O
valuable O
things O
from O
the O
dead O
bodies O
! O
'' O

The O
Moabites O
came O
to O
the O
Israelite O
camp O
, O
but O
the O
Israelites O
came O
out O
and O
attacked O
the O
Moabite O
army O
. O

The O
Moabites O
ran O
away O
from O
the O
Israelites O
. O

The O
Israelites O
followed O
them O
into O
Moab O
to O
fight O
them O
. O

The O
Israelites O
destroyed O
the O
cities O
. O

They O
threw O
their O
stones O
at O
every O
good O
field O
in O
Moab O
. O

They O
stopped O
up O
all O
the O
springs O
of O
water O
and O
cut O
down O
all O
the O
good O
trees O
. O

The O
Israelites O
fought O
all O
the O
way O
to O
Kir O
Hareseth O
. O

The O
soldiers O
surrounded O
Kir O
Hareseth O
and O
attacked O
it O
too O
. O

The O
king O
of O
Moab O
saw O
that O
the O
battle O
was O
too O
strong O
for O
him O
, O
so O
he O
took O
700 O
men O
with O
swords O
to O
break O
through O
to O
the O
king O
of O
Edom O
. O

But O
they O
were O
not O
able O
to O
do O
it O
. O

Then O
the O
king O
of O
Moab O
took O
his O
oldest O
son O
, O
who O
would O
become O
the O
next O
king O
after O
him O
. O

On O
the O
wall O
around O
the O
city O
, O
the O
king O
of O
Moab O
offered O
his O
son O
as O
a O
burnt O
offering O
. O

This O
upset O
the O
Israelites O
very O
much O
. O

So O
the O
Israelites O
left O
the O
king O
of O
Moab O
and O
went O
back O
to O
their O
own O
land O
. O

Naaman O
was O
the O
captain O
of O
the O
army O
of O
the O
king O
of O
Aram O
. O

He O
was O
very O
important O
to O
his O
king O
because O
the O
Lord O
used O
him O
to O
lead O
Aram O
to O
victory O
. O

Naaman O
was O
a O
great O
and O
powerful O
man O
, O
but O
he O
was O
also O
sick O
with O
leprosy O
. O

The O
Aramean O
army O
sent O
many O
groups O
of O
soldiers O
to O
fight O
in O
Israel O
. O

One O
time O
they O
took O
a O
little O
girl O
from O
the O
land O
of O
Israel O
. O

This O
girl O
became O
a O
servant O
of O
Naaman O
's O
wife O
. O

She O
said O
to O
his O
wife O
, O
`` O
I O
wish O
that O
my O
master O
would O
meet O
the O
prophet O
who O
lives O
in O
Samaria O
. O

He O
could O
heal O
Naaman O
of O
his O
leprosy O
. O
'' O

Naaman O
went O
to O
the O
king O
and O
told O
him O
what O
the O
Israelite O
girl O
said O
. O

Then O
the O
king O
of O
Aram O
said O
, O
`` O
Go O
now O
, O
and O
I O
will O
send O
a O
letter O
to O
the O
king O
of O
Israel O
. O
'' O

So O
Naaman O
went O
to O
Israel O
. O

He O
took O
750 O
pounds O
of O
silver O
, O
6000 O
pieces O
of O
gold O
and O
ten O
changes O
of O
clothes O
as O
gifts O
. O

Naaman O
took O
the O
letter O
from O
the O
king O
of O
Aram O
to O
the O
king O
of O
Israel O
. O

The O
letter O
said O
: O
`` O
Now O
this O
letter O
is O
to O
show O
that O
I O
am O
sending O
my O
servant O
Naaman O
to O
you O
. O

Cure O
his O
leprosy O
. O
'' O

When O
the O
king O
of O
Israel O
had O
read O
the O
letter O
, O
he O
tore O
his O
clothes O
to O
show O
he O
was O
sad O
and O
upset O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Am O
I O
God O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
have O
the O
power O
over O
life O
and O
death O
. O

So O
why O
did O
the O
king O
of O
Aram O
send O
a O
man O
sick O
with O
leprosy O
for O
me O
to O
heal O
? O

Think O
about O
it O
, O
and O
you O
will O
see O
that O
it O
is O
a O
trick O
. O

The O
king O
of O
Aram O
is O
trying O
to O
start O
a O
fight O
. O
'' O

Elisha O
, O
the O
man O
of O
God O
, O
heard O
that O
the O
king O
of O
Israel O
had O
torn O
his O
clothes O
. O

So O
Elisha O
sent O
this O
message O
to O
the O
king O
: O
`` O
Why O
did O
you O
tear O
your O
clothes O
? O

Let O
Naaman O
come O
to O
me O
. O

Then O
he O
will O
know O
there O
is O
a O
prophet O
in O
Israel O
. O
'' O

So O
Naaman O
came O
with O
his O
horses O
and O
chariots O
to O
Elisha O
's O
house O
and O
stood O
outside O
the O
door O
. O

Elisha O
sent O
a O
messenger O
to O
Naaman O
who O
said O
, O
`` O
Go O
and O
wash O
in O
the O
Jordan O
River O
seven O
times O
. O

Then O
your O
skin O
will O
be O
healed O
, O
and O
you O
will O
be O
pure O
and O
clean O
. O
'' O

Naaman O
became O
angry O
and O
left O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
thought O
Elisha O
would O
at O
least O
come O
out O
and O
stand O
in O
front O
of O
me O
and O
call O
on O
the O
name O
of O
the O
Lord O
his O
God O
. O

I O
thought O
he O
would O
wave O
his O
hand O
over O
my O
body O
and O
heal O
the O
leprosy O
. O

Abana O
and O
Pharpar O
, O
the O
rivers O
of O
Damascus O
, O
are O
better O
than O
all O
the O
water O
in O
Israel O
. O

Why O
ca O
n't O
I O
wash O
in O
those O
rivers O
in O
Damascus O
and O
become O
clean O
? O
'' O

He O
was O
very O
angry O
and O
turned O
to O
leave O
. O

But O
Naaman O
's O
servants O
went O
to O
him O
and O
talked O
to O
him O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Father O
, O
if O
the O
prophet O
told O
you O
to O
do O
some O
great O
thing O
, O
you O
would O
do O
it O
, O
is O
n't O
that O
right O
? O

But O
he O
said O
, O
' O
Wash O
, O
and O
you O
will O
be O
pure O
and O
clean O
. O
' O
'' O

So O
Naaman O
did O
what O
the O
man O
of O
God O
said O
. O

He O
went O
down O
and O
dipped O
himself O
in O
the O
Jordan O
River O
seven O
times O
, O
and O
he O
became O
pure O
and O
clean O
. O

His O
skin O
became O
soft O
like O
the O
skin O
of O
a O
baby O
. O

Naaman O
and O
his O
whole O
group O
came O
back O
to O
the O
man O
of O
God O
. O

He O
stood O
before O
Elisha O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Look O
, O
I O
now O
know O
there O
is O
no O
God O
in O
all O
the O
earth O
except O
in O
Israel O
. O

Now O
please O
accept O
a O
gift O
from O
me O
. O
'' O

But O
Elisha O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
serve O
the O
Lord O
. O

And O
I O
promise O
, O
as O
the O
Lord O
lives O
, O
I O
will O
not O
accept O
any O
gift O
. O
'' O

Naaman O
tried O
hard O
to O
make O
Elisha O
take O
the O
gift O
, O
but O
he O
refused O
. O

Then O
Naaman O
said O
, O
`` O
If O
you O
will O
not O
accept O
this O
gift O
, O
at O
least O
do O
this O
for O
me O
. O

Let O
me O
have O
enough O
dirt O
from O
Israel O
to O
fill O
the O
baskets O
on O
two O
of O
my O
mules O
. O

I O
ask O
this O
because O
I O
will O
never O
again O
offer O
any O
burnt O
offering O
or O
sacrifice O
to O
any O
other O
gods O
. O

I O
will O
offer O
sacrifices O
only O
to O
the O
Lord O
! O

And O
I O
pray O
that O
the O
Lord O
will O
forgive O
me O
for O
this O
: O
When O
my O
master O
goes O
to O
the O
temple O
of O
Rimmon O
to O
worship O
that O
false O
god O
, O
he O
will O
want O
to O
lean O
on O
me O
for O
support O
. O

So O
I O
must O
bow O
down O
in O
the O
temple O
of O
Rimmon O
. O

I O
ask O
the O
Lord O
now O
to O
forgive O
me O
when O
that O
happens O
. O
'' O

Then O
Elisha O
said O
to O
Naaman O
, O
`` O
Go O
in O
peace O
. O
'' O

So O
Naaman O
left O
Elisha O
and O
went O
a O
short O
way O
. O

But O
Gehazi O
, O
the O
servant O
of O
Elisha O
the O
man O
of O
God O
, O
said O
, O
`` O
Look O
, O
my O
master O
has O
let O
Naaman O
the O
Aramean O
go O
without O
accepting O
the O
gift O
that O
he O
brought O
. O

As O
the O
Lord O
lives O
, O
I O
will O
run O
after O
Naaman O
and O
get O
something O
from O
him O
. O
'' O

So O
Gehazi O
ran O
to O
Naaman O
. O

Naaman O
saw O
someone O
running O
after O
him O
. O

He O
stepped O
down O
from O
the O
chariot O
to O
meet O
Gehazi O
. O

Naaman O
said O
, O
`` O
Is O
everything O
all O
right O
? O
'' O

Gehazi O
said O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
everything O
is O
all O
right O
. O

My O
master O
has O
sent O
me O
. O

He O
said O
, O
' O
Look O
, O
two O
young O
men O
came O
to O
me O
from O
the O
group O
of O
prophets O
in O
the O
hill O
country O
of O
Ephraim O
. O

Please O
give O
them O
75 O
pounds O
of O
silver O
and O
two O
changes O
of O
clothes O
. O
' O
'' O

Naaman O
said O
, O
`` O
Please O
, O
take O
150 O
pounds O
. O
'' O

He O
persuaded O
Gehazi O
to O
take O
the O
silver O
. O

Naaman O
put O
150 O
pounds O
of O
silver O
in O
two O
bags O
and O
took O
two O
changes O
of O
clothes O
. O

Then O
he O
gave O
these O
things O
to O
two O
of O
his O
servants O
. O

The O
servants O
carried O
these O
things O
for O
Gehazi O
. O

When O
Gehazi O
came O
to O
the O
hill O
, O
he O
took O
these O
things O
from O
the O
servants O
. O

He O
sent O
the O
servants O
away O
, O
and O
they O
left O
. O

Then O
he O
hid O
those O
things O
in O
the O
house O
. O

Gehazi O
came O
in O
and O
stood O
before O
his O
master O
. O

Elisha O
said O
to O
Gehazi O
, O
`` O
Where O
have O
you O
been O
Gehazi O
? O
'' O

Gehazi O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
did O
n't O
go O
anywhere O
. O
'' O

Elisha O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
That O
is O
not O
true O
! O

My O
heart O
was O
with O
you O
when O
the O
man O
turned O
from O

Now O
you O

You O

When O
Gehazi O
left O
Elisha O

his O
skin O
was O
as O
white O
as O

He O
was O
sick O
with O

son O
of O
King O
Joash O
of O
Judah O
became O
king O
in O
the O
second O
year O
that O
Jehoash O
son O
of O
Jehoahaz O
was O
king O
of O
Israel O
. O

Amaziah O
was O
25 O
years O
old O
when O
he O
began O
to O
rule O
. O

He O
ruled O
29 O
years O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

His O
mother O
was O
Jehoaddin O
from O
Jerusalem O
. O

Amaziah O
did O
what O
the O
Lord O
said O
was O
right O
, O
but O
he O
did O
not O
follow O
God O
completely O
like O
David O
his O
ancestor O
. O

Amaziah O
did O
everything O
that O
Joash O
his O
father O
had O
done O
. O

He O
did O
not O
destroy O
the O
high O
places O
. O

The O
people O
still O
sacrificed O
and O
burned O
incense O
at O
those O
places O
of O
worship O
. O

At O
the O
time O
that O
Amaziah O
had O
strong O
control O
of O
the O
kingdom O
, O
he O
killed O
the O
officers O
who O
had O
killed O
his O
father O
. O

But O
he O
did O
not O
kill O
the O
children O
of O
the O
murderers O
because O
of O
the O
rules O
written O
in O
the O
book O
, O
The O
Law O
of O
Moses O
. O

The O
Lord O
gave O
this O
command O
in O
there O
: O
`` O
Parents O
must O
not O
be O
put O
to O
death O
for O
something O
their O
children O
did O
. O

And O
children O
must O
not O
be O
put O
to O
death O
for O
something O
their O
parents O
did O
. O

People O
should O
be O
put O
to O
death O
only O
for O
what O
that O
they O
themselves O
did O
. O
'' O

Amaziah O
killed O
10,000 O
Edomites O
in O
the O
Valley O
of O
Salt O
. O

In O
war O
Amaziah O
took O
Sela O
and O
called O
it O
`` O
Joktheel O
. O
'' O

It O
is O
still O
called O
`` O
Joktheel O
'' O
today O
. O

Amaziah O
sent O
messengers O
to O
Jehoash O
son O
of O
Jehoahaz O
, O
son O
of O
King O
Jehu O
of O
Israel O
. O

Amaziah O
's O
message O
said O
, O
`` O
Come O
on O
, O
let O
's O
meet O
together O
face O
to O
face O
and O
fight O
. O
'' O

King O
Jehoash O
of O
Israel O
sent O
an O
answer O
to O
King O
Amaziah O
of O
Judah O
. O

Jehoash O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
thornbush O
in O
Lebanon O
sent O
a O
message O
to O
the O
cedar O
tree O
in O
Lebanon O
. O

It O
said O
, O
' O
Give O
your O
daughter O
for O
my O
son O
to O
marry O
. O
' O

But O
a O
wild O
animal O
from O
Lebanon O
passed O
by O
and O
trampled O
down O
the O
thornbush O
. O

True O
, O
you O
have O
defeated O
Edom O
. O

But O
you O
have O
become O
proud O
because O
of O
your O
victory O
over O
Edom O
. O

But O
stay O
at O
home O
and O
brag O
! O

Do O
n't O
make O
trouble O
for O
yourself O
. O

If O
you O
do O
this O
, O
you O
will O
fall O
, O
and O
Judah O
will O
fall O
with O
you O
! O
'' O

But O
Amaziah O
would O
not O
listen O
to O
Jehoash O
's O
warning O
. O

So O
King O
Jehoash O
of O
Israel O
went O
to O
fight O
against O
King O
Amaziah O
of O
Judah O
at O
Beth O
Shemesh O
in O
Judah O
. O

Israel O
defeated O
Judah O
. O

Every O
man O
of O
Judah O
ran O
home O
. O

At O
Beth O
Shemesh O
, O
King O
Jehoash O
of O
Israel O
captured O
King O
Amaziah O
of O
Judah O
, O
the O
son O
of O
Joash O
, O
the O
son O
of O
Ahaziah O
. O

Jehoash O
took O
Amaziah O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

Jehoash O
broke O
down O
the O
wall O
of O
Jerusalem O
from O
the O
Gate O
of O
Ephraim O
to O
the O
corner O
gate O
, O
about O
600 O
feet O
. O

Then O
Jehoash O
took O
all O
the O
gold O
and O
silver O
and O
all O
the O
dishes O
in O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
and O
in O
the O
treasures O
of O
the O
king O
's O
palace O
. O

Jehoash O
also O
took O
people O
to O
be O
his O
prisoners O
. O

Then O
he O
went O
back O
to O
Samaria O
. O

All O
the O
great O
things O
that O
Jehoash O
did O
, O

how O
he O
fought O

King O
Amaziah O

Jehoash O

He O
was O

with O

Jehoash O

Jeroboam O
became O
the O

king O
after O
him O

King O
Amaziah O
son O
of O
Joash O
of O
Judah O
lived O
15 O
years O
after O
the O
death O
of O
King O
Jehoash O
son O

The O

made O
a O
plan O
against O
Amaziah O
in O
Jerusalem O
, O
so O
he O
ran O
away O
to O
Lachish O
. O

But O
the O
people O
sent O
men O
after O
Amaziah O
to O
Lachish O
, O
and O
they O
killed O
him O
there O
. O

The O
people O
brought O
Amaziah O

body O
back O
on O
horses O
. O

He O
was O
buried O
at O
Jerusalem O
with O
his O
ancestors O
in O
the O
City O

David O

Then O
all O
the O
people O
of O
Judah O
made O
Azariah O
the O
new O
king O
. O

Azariah O
was O
16 O
years O
old O
. O

So O
King O
Amaziah O
died O
and O
was O
buried O
with O
his O
ancestors O
. O

Then O
Azariah O
rebuilt O
Elath O
and O
got O
it O
back O
for O
Judah O
. O

King O
Jeroboam O
son O
of O
Jehoash O
of O
Israel O
began O
to O
rule O
in O
Samaria O
during O
the O
15th O
year O
that O
Amaziah O
son O
of O
Joash O
was O
king O
of O
Judah O
. O

Jeroboam O
ruled O
41 O
years O
. O

Jeroboam O
did O
what O
the O
Lord O
said O
was O
wrong O
. O

He O
did O
not O
stop O
committing O
the O
sins O
of O
Jeroboam O
son O
of O
Nebat O
who O
caused O
Israel O
to O
sin O

Jeroboam O
took O
back O
Israel O
's O
land O
, O
which O
ran O
from O
the O
Lebo O
Hamath O
to O
the O
Arabah O
Sea O
. O

This O
happened O
as O
the O
Lord O
of O
Israel O
had O
told O
his O
servant O
Jonah O
son O
of O
Amittai O
, O
the O
prophet O
from O
Gath O
Hepher O
. O

The O
Lord O
saw O
that O
all O
the O
Israelites O
, O
both O
slaves O
and O
free O
men O
, O
had O
many O
troubles O
. O

No O
one O
was O
left O
who O
could O
help O
Israel O

The O
Lord O
did O
not O
say O
that O
he O
would O
take O
away O
the O
name O
of O
Israel O
from O
the O
world O
. O

So O
he O
used O
Jeroboam O
son O
of O
Jehoash O
to O
save O
the O
Israelites O

He O

He O

made O

statue O
of O
Asherah O

He O
put O
this O
statue O
in O

The O
Lord O
had O
said O
to O
David O

to O
David O

Solomon O
about O
this O
Temple O
: O
`` O
I O
have O
chosen O

I O
will O
not O
cause O
the O
Israelites O
to O
leave O
the O
land O
that O
I O
gave O
to O
their O

I O
will O
let O
the O
people O
stay O
in O

land O
if O
they O
obey O
everything O
I O
commanded O
them O
and O
all O
the O
teachings O
that O
my O
servant O
Moses O
gave O
them O
. O
'' O

But O
the O
people O
did O
not O
listen O
to O
God O
. O

Manasseh O
did O
more O
evil O
things O
than O
all O
the O
nations O
that O
lived O
in O
Canaan O
before O
Israel O
came O
. O

And O
the O
Lord O
destroyed O
those O
nations O
when O
the O
Israelites O
came O
to O
take O
their O
land O
. O

The O
Lord O
used O
his O
servants O
the O
prophets O
to O
say O
this O
: O
`` O
King O
Manasseh O
of O
Judah O

done O

him O

He O
also O
has O
caused O
Judah O

sin O

the O
Lord O
, O
the O
God O

, O
says O
, O
' O
Look O
! O

I O
will O
bring O
so O

anyone O

me O
angry O

up O

He O
filled O

another O

she O
told O
him O
. O

Then O
the O
king O
chose O
an O
officer O
to O
help O
her O
. O

The O
king O
said O
, O
`` O
Give O
to O
the O
woman O
all O
that O
belongs O
to O
her O
. O

And O
give O
her O
all O
the O
harvest O
of O
her O
land O
from O
the O
day O
she O
left O
the O
country O
until O
now O
. O
'' O

Elisha O
went O
to O
Damascus O
. O

King O
Ben-Hadad O
of O
Aram O
was O
sick O
. O

Someone O
told O
Ben-Hadad O
, O
`` O
The O
man O
of O
God O
has O
come O
here O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
King O
Ben-Hadad O
said O
to O
Hazael O
, O
`` O
Take O
a O
gift O
and O
go O
meet O
the O
man O
of O
God O
. O

Ask O
him O
to O
ask O
the O
Lord O
if O
I O
will O
get O
well O
from O
my O
sickness O
. O
'' O

So O
Hazael O
went O
to O
meet O
Elisha O
. O

Hazael O
brought O
a O
gift O
with O
him O
. O

He O
brought O
all O
kinds O
of O
good O
things O
from O
Damascus O
. O

It O
took O
40 O
camels O
to O
carry O
everything O
. O

Hazael O
came O
to O
Elisha O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Your O
follower O
, O
King O
Ben-Hadad O
of O
Aram O
, O
sent O
me O
to O
you O
. O

He O
asks O
if O
he O
will O
get O
well O
from O
his O
sickness O
. O
'' O

Then O
Elisha O
said O
to O
Hazael O
, O
`` O
Go O
and O
tell O
Ben-Hadad O
, O
' O
You O
will O
live O
. O
' O

But O
really O
the O
Lord O
told O
me O
, O
' O
He O
will O
die O
. O
' O
'' O

Elisha O
began O
to O
stare O
. O

He O
stared O
for O
an O
embarrassingly O
long O
time O
. O

Then O
the O
man O
of O
God O
began O
to O
cry O
. O

Hazael O
said O
, O
`` O
Sir O
, O
why O
are O
you O
crying O
? O
'' O

Elisha O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
crying O
because O
I O
know O
the O
bad O
things O
you O
will O
do O
to O
the O
Israelites O
. O

You O
will O
burn O
their O
strong O
cities O
and O
kill O
their O
young O
men O
with O
swords O
. O

You O
will O
kill O
their O
babies O
and O
split O
open O
their O
pregnant O
women O
. O
'' O

Hazael O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
not O
a O
powerful O
man O
! O

How O
can O
I O
do O
these O
great O
things O
? O
'' O

Elisha O
answered O
, O
`` O
The O
Lord O
showed O
me O
that O
you O
will O
be O
king O
over O
Aram O
. O
'' O

Then O
Hazael O
left O
Elisha O
and O
went O
to O
his O
king O
. O

Ben-Hadad O
said O
to O
Hazael O
, O
`` O
What O
did O
Elisha O
say O
to O
you O
? O
'' O

He O
answered O
, O
`` O
Elisha O
told O
me O
that O
you O
will O
live O
. O
'' O

But O
the O
next O
day O
Hazael O
took O
a O
thick O
cloth O
and O
dipped O
it O
in O
water O
. O

Then O
he O
held O
it O
on O
Ben-Hadad O
's O
face O
until O
he O
died O
. O

Then O
Hazael O
became O
the O
new O
king O
. O

Jehoram O
son O
of O
Jehoshaphat O
was O
the O
king O
of O
Judah O
. O

He O
began O
to O
rule O
in O
the O
fifth O
year O
that O
Joram O
son O
of O
Ahab O
was O
king O
of O
Israel O
. O

Jehoram O
was O
32 O
years O
old O
when O
he O
began O
to O
rule O
. O

He O
ruled O
eight O
years O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

But O
Jehoram O
lived O
like O
the O
kings O
of O
Israel O
and O
did O
what O
the O
Lord O
saw O
as O
evil O
. O

He O
lived O
like O
the O
people O
from O
Ahab O
's O
family O
, O
because O
his O
wife O
was O
Ahab O
's O
daughter O
. O

But O
the O
Lord O
would O
not O
destroy O
Judah O
because O
of O
the O
promise O
to O
his O
servant O
David O
. O

The O
Lord O
had O
promised O
David O
that O
someone O
from O
his O
family O
would O
always O
be O
king O
. O

In O
Jehoram O
's O
time O
Edom O
broke O
away O
from O
Judah O
's O
rule O
. O

The O
people O
of O
Edom O
chose O
a O
king O
for O
themselves O
. O

Then O
Jehoram O
and O
all O
his O
chariots O
went O
to O
Zair O
. O

The O
Edomite O
army O
surrounded O
them O
, O
but O
Jehoram O
and O
his O
officers O
attacked O
them O
and O
escaped O
. O

Jehoram O
's O
soldiers O
all O
ran O
away O
and O
went O
home O
. O

So O
the O
Edomites O
broke O
away O
from O
the O
rule O
of O
Judah O
. O

And O
they O
have O
been O
free O
from O
the O
rule O
of O
Judah O
until O
today O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
Libnah O
also O
broke O
away O
from O
Judah O
's O
rule O
. O

All O
the O
things O
Jehoram O
did O
are O
written O
in O
the O
book O
, O
The O
History O
of O
the O
Kings O
of O
Judah O
. O

Jehoram O
died O
and O
was O
buried O
with O
his O
ancestors O
in O
the O
City O
of O
David O
. O

Jehoram O
's O
son O
Ahaziah O
became O
the O
new O
king O
. O

Ahaziah O
son O
of O
Jehoram O
became O
the O
king O
of O
Judah O
in O
the O
12th O
year O
that O
Joram O
son O
of O
Ahab O
was O
king O
of O
Israel O
. O

Ahaziah O
was O
22 O
years O
old O
when O
he O
began O
to O
rule O
. O

He O
ruled O
one O
year O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

His O
mother O
's O
name O
was O
Athaliah O
. O

She O
was O
the O
daughter O
of O
King O
Omri O
of O
Israel O
. O

Ahaziah O
did O
what O
the O
Lord O
said O
was O
wrong O
. O

He O
did O
many O
bad O
things O
, O
just O
as O
the O
people O
from O
Ahab O
's O
family O
had O
done O
. O

He O
lived O
like O
this O
because O
his O
wife O
was O
from O
Ahab O
's O
family O
. O

Joram O
was O
from O
Ahab O
's O
family O
. O

Ahaziah O
went O
with O
Joram O
to O
fight O
against O
King O
Hazael O
of O
Aram O
at O
Ramoth O
Gilead O
. O

The O
Arameans O
wounded O
Joram O
. O

King O
Joram O
went O
back O
to O
Israel O
so O
that O
he O
could O
get O
well O
from O
those O
wounds O
. O

He O
went O
to O
the O
area O
of O
Jezreel O
. O

Ahaziah O
son O
of O
Jehoram O
was O
the O
king O
of O
Judah O
. O

Ahaziah O
went O
to O
Jezreel O
to O
see O
Joram O
. O

Hoshea O
son O
of O
Elah O
began O
to O
rule O
in O
Samaria O
over O
Israel O
. O

This O
was O
during O
the O
12th O
year O
that O
Ahaz O
was O
king O
of O
Judah O
. O

Hoshea O
ruled O
nine O
years O
. O

He O
did O
what O
the O
Lord O
said O
was O
wrong O
, O
but O
he O
was O
not O
as O
bad O
as O
the O
kings O
of O
Israel O
who O
had O
ruled O
before O
him O
. O

King O
Shalmaneser O
of O
Assyria O
came O
to O
fight O
against O
Hoshea O
and O
defeated O
him O
. O

So O
Hoshea O
paid O
tribute O
to O
Shalmaneser O
. O

Later O
, O
Hoshea O
sent O
messengers O
to O
the O
king O
of O
Egypt O
to O
ask O
for O
help O
. O

That O
king O
's O
name O
was O
So O
. O

That O
year O
Hoshea O
did O
not O
pay O
tribute O
to O
the O
king O
of O
Assyria O
as O
he O
did O
every O
other O
year O
. O

The O
king O
of O
Assyria O
learned O
that O
Hoshea O
had O
made O
plans O
against O
him O
. O

So O
he O
arrested O
Hoshea O
and O
put O
him O
in O
jail O
. O

The O
king O
of O
Assyria O
attacked O
many O
places O
in O
Israel O
. O

Then O
he O
came O
to O
Samaria O
and O
fought O
against O
it O
for O
three O
years O
. O

The O
king O
of O
Assyria O
took O
Samaria O
during O
the O
ninth O
year O
that O
Hoshea O
was O
king O
of O
Israel O
. O

He O
captured O
many O
Israelites O
and O
took O
them O
as O
prisoners O
to O
Assyria O
. O

He O
made O
them O
live O
in O
Halah O
by O
the O
Habor O
River O
at O
Gozan O
and O
in O
other O
cities O
of O
the O
Medes O
. O

These O
things O
happened O
because O
the O
Israelites O
had O
sinned O
against O
the O
Lord O
their O
God O
. O

And O
it O
was O
the O
Lord O
who O
brought O
the O
Israelites O
out O
of O
the O
land O
of O
Egypt O
! O

He O
saved O
them O
from O
the O
power O
of O
Pharaoh O
, O
the O
king O
of O
Egypt O
. O

But O
the O
Israelites O
began O
worshiping O
other O
gods O
. O

They O
began O
doing O
the O
same O
things O
that O
other O
people O
did O
. O

And O
the O
Lord O
had O
forced O
those O
people O
to O
leave O
their O
land O
when O
the O
Israelites O
came O
. O

The O
Israelites O
also O
chose O
to O
be O
ruled O
by O
kings O
. O

The O
Israelites O
secretly O
did O
things O
against O
the O
Lord O
their O
God O
, O
and O
those O
things O
were O
wrong O
! O

The O
Israelites O
built O
high O
places O
in O
all O
their O
cities O
-- O
from O
the O
smallest O
town O
to O
the O
largest O
city O
. O

They O
put O
up O
memorial O
stones O
and O
Asherah O
poles O
on O
every O
high O
hill O
and O
under O
every O
green O
tree O
. O

They O
burned O
incense O
there O
in O
all O
those O
places O
for O
worship O
. O

They O
did O
these O
things O
like O
the O
nations O
that O
the O
Lord O
forced O
out O
of O
the O
land O
before O
them O
. O

The O
Israelites O
did O
evil O
things O
that O
made O
the O
Lord O
angry O
. O

They O
served O
idols O
, O
and O
the O
Lord O
had O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
You O
must O
not O
do O
this O
. O
'' O

The O
Lord O
used O
every O
prophet O
and O
every O
seer O
to O
warn O
Israel O
and O
Judah O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Turn O
away O
from O
the O
evil O
things O
you O
do O
. O

Obey O
my O
commands O
and O
laws O
. O

Follow O
all O
the O
law O
that O
I O
gave O
to O
your O
ancestors O
. O

I O
used O
my O
servants O
the O
prophets O
to O
give O
this O
law O
to O
you O
. O
'' O

But O
the O
people O
would O
not O
listen O
. O

They O
were O
very O
stubborn O
like O
their O
ancestors O
. O

Their O
ancestors O
did O
not O
believe O
the O
Lord O
their O
God O
. O

They O
refused O
the O
Lord O
's O
laws O
and O
the O
agreement O
that O
he O
made O
with O
their O
ancestors O
. O

They O
refused O
to O
listen O
to O
the O
Lord O
's O
warnings O
. O

They O
worshiped O
idols O
that O
were O
worth O
nothing O
and O
they O
themselves O
became O
worth O
nothing O
. O

They O
lived O
like O
the O
people O
in O
the O
nations O
around O
them O
. O

They O
did O
those O
bad O
things O
. O

And O
the O
Lord O
had O
warned O
the O
Israelites O
. O

The O
Lord O
told O
them O
not O
to O
do O
those O
bad O
things O
. O

The O
people O
stopped O
following O
the O
commands O
of O
the O
Lord O
their O
God O
. O

They O
made O
two O
gold O
statues O
of O
calves O
. O

They O
made O
Asherah O
poles O
. O

They O
worshiped O
all O
the O
stars O
of O
heaven O
and O
served O
Baal O
. O

They O
sacrificed O
their O
sons O
and O
daughters O
in O
the O
fire O
. O

They O
used O
magic O
and O
witchcraft O
to O
try O
to O
learn O
the O
future O
. O

They O
sold O
themselves O
to O
do O
what O
the O
Lord O
said O
was O
evil O
. O

They O
did O
this O
to O
make O
the O
Lord O
angry O
. O

So O
the O
Lord O
became O
very O
angry O
with O
Israel O
and O
removed O
them O
from O
his O
sight O
. O

There O
were O
no O
Israelites O
left O
, O
except O
the O
tribe O
of O
Judah O
. O

But O
even O
the O
people O
of O
Judah O
did O
not O
obey O
the O
commands O
of O
the O
Lord O
their O
God O
. O

They O
lived O
just O
as O
the O
Israelites O
had O
. O

The O
Lord O
rejected O
all O
the O
Israelites O
. O

He O
brought O
them O
many O
troubles O
. O

He O
let O
people O
destroy O
them O
. O

Finally O
he O
threw O
them O
away O
and O
removed O
them O
from O
his O
sight O
. O

The O
Lord O
tore O
them O
from O
the O
family O
of O
David O
, O
and O
they O
made O
Jeroboam O
son O
of O
Nebat O
their O
king O
. O

Jeroboam O
pulled O
the O
Israelites O
away O
from O
following O
the O
Lord O
. O

He O
caused O
them O
to O
commit O
a O
great O
sin O
. O

So O
the O
Israelites O
sinned O
in O
all O
the O
ways O
Jeroboam O
did O
. O

And O
they O
did O
not O
stop O
committing O
these O
sins O
until O
the O
Lord O
took O
Israel O
away O
from O
his O
sight O
. O

And O
he O
said O
this O
would O
happen O
. O

He O
sent O
his O
prophets O
to O
tell O
the O
people O
this O
would O
happen O
. O

So O
the O
Israelites O
were O
taken O
out O
of O
their O
country O
into O
Assyria O
. O

And O
they O
have O
been O
there O
to O
this O
day O
. O

The O
king O
of O
Assyria O
took O
the O
Israelites O
out O
of O
Samaria O
and O
brought O
in O
other O
people O
from O
Babylon O
, O
Cuthah O
, O
Avva O
, O
Hamath O
, O
and O
Sepharvaim O
. O

They O
took O
over O
Samaria O
and O
lived O
in O
the O
cities O
around O
it O
. O

When O
these O
people O
began O
to O
live O
in O
Samaria O
, O
they O
did O
not O
honor O
the O
Lord O
, O
so O
the O
Lord O
sent O
lions O
to O
attack O
them O
. O

The O
lions O
killed O
some O
of O
them O
. O

Some O
people O
said O
to O
the O
king O
of O
Assyria O
, O
`` O
The O
people O
who O
you O
took O
away O
and O
put O
in O
the O
cities O
of O
Samaria O
do O
n't O
know O
the O
law O
of O
the O
god O
of O
that O
country O
. O

So O
that O
god O
sent O
lions O
to O
attack O
them O
. O

The O
lions O
killed O
them O
because O
they O
do O
n't O
know O
the O
law O
of O
the O
god O
of O
that O
country O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
king O
of O
Assyria O
gave O
this O
command O
: O
`` O
You O
took O
some O
priests O
from O
Samaria O
. O

Send O
one O
of O
them O
who O
I O
captured O
back O
to O
Samaria O
. O

Let O
that O
priest O
go O
and O
live O
there O
. O

Then O
he O
can O
teach O
the O
people O
the O
law O
of O
the O
god O
of O
that O
country O
. O
'' O

So O
one O
of O
the O
priests O
who O
the O
Assyrians O
had O
carried O
away O
from O
Samaria O
came O
to O
live O
in O
Bethel O
. O

He O
taught O
the O
people O
how O
they O
should O
honor O
the O
Lord O
. O

But O
all O
those O
people O
made O
gods O
of O
their O
own O
. O

They O
put O
them O
in O
the O
temples O
at O
the O
high O
places O
that O
the O
people O
of O
Samaria O
had O
made O
. O

They O
did O
this O
wherever O
they O
lived O
. O

The O
people O
of O
Babylon O
made O
the O
false O
god O
Succoth O
Benoth O
. O

The O
people O
of O
Cuthah O
made O
the O
false O
god O
Nergal O
. O

The O
people O
of O
Hamath O
made O
the O
false O
god O
Ashima O
. O

The O
people O
of O
Avva O
made O
the O
false O
gods O
Nibhaz O
and O
Tartak O
. O

The O
people O
from O
Sepharvaim O
also O
burned O
their O
children O
in O
the O
fire O
to O
honor O
their O
false O
gods O
, O
Adrammelech O
and O
Anammelech O
. O

But O
they O
also O
worshiped O
the O
Lord O
. O

They O
chose O
priests O
for O
the O
high O
places O
from O
among O
the O
people O
. O

These O
priests O
made O
sacrifices O
for O
the O
people O
in O
the O
temples O
at O
those O
places O
of O
worship O
. O

They O
respected O
the O
Lord O
but O
also O
served O
their O
own O
gods O
, O
just O
as O
they O
did O
in O
their O
own O
countries O
. O

Even O
today O
they O
live O
like O
they O
did O
in O
the O
past O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
honor O
the O
Lord O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
obey O
the O
rules O
and O
commands O
of O
the O
Israelites O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
obey O
the O
law O
or O
the O
commands O
that O
the O
Lord O
gave O
to O
the O
children O
of O
Jacob O
. O

The O
Lord O
made O
an O
agreement O
with O
the O
Israelites O
. O

The O
Lord O
commanded O
them O
, O
`` O
You O
must O
not O
honor O
other O
gods O
. O

You O
must O
not O
worship O
them O
or O
serve O
them O
or O
offer O
sacrifices O
to O
them O
. O

But O
you O
must O
follow O
the O
Lord O
, O
who O
brought O
you O
out O
of O
Egypt O
. O

He O
used O
his O
great O
power O
to O
save O
you O
. O

You O
must O
worship O
him O
and O
make O
sacrifices O
to O
him O
. O

You O
must O
obey O
the O
rules O
, O
laws O
, O
teachings O
, O
and O
commands O
that O
he O
wrote O
for O
you O
. O

You O
must O
obey O
these O
things O
all O
the O
time O
. O

You O
must O
not O
respect O
other O
gods O
. O

You O
must O
not O
forget O
the O
agreement O
that O
I O
made O
with O
you O
. O

You O
must O
not O
respect O
other O
gods O
. O

No O
, O
you O
must O
respect O
only O
the O
Lord O
your O
God O
. O

Then O
he O
will O
save O
you O
from O
all O
your O
enemies O
. O
'' O

But O
the O
Israelites O
did O
not O
listen O
. O

They O
kept O
on O
doing O
the O
same O
things O
they O
did O
before O
. O

So O
now O
those O
other O
nations O
respected O
the O
Lord O
, O
but O
they O
also O
served O
their O
own O
idols O
. O

Their O
children O
and O
grandchildren O
did O
the O
same O
thing O
their O
ancestors O
did O
. O

They O
still O
do O
these O
things O
to O
this O
day O
. O

A O
man O
from O
the O
group O
of O
prophets O
had O
a O
wife O
. O

This O
man O
died O
, O
and O
his O
wife O
cried O
out O
to O
Elisha O
, O
`` O
My O
husband O
was O
like O
a O
servant O
to O
you O
. O

Now O
he O
is O
dead O
! O

You O
know O
he O
honored O
the O
Lord O
. O

But O
he O
owed O
money O
to O
a O
man O
. O

Now O
that O
man O
is O
coming O
to O
take O
my O
two O
boys O
and O
make O
them O
his O
slaves O
! O
'' O

Elisha O
answered O
, O
`` O
How O
can O
I O
help O
you O
? O

Tell O
me O
, O
what O
do O
you O
have O
in O
your O
house O
? O
'' O

The O
woman O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
anything O
in O
the O
house O
except O
a O
jar O
of O
olive O
oil O
. O
'' O

Then O
Elisha O
said O
, O
`` O
Go O
and O
borrow O
bowls O
from O
all O
your O
neighbors O
. O

They O
must O
be O
empty O
. O

Borrow O
plenty O
of O
bowls O
. O

Then O
go O
to O
your O
house O
and O
close O
the O
doors O
. O

Only O
you O
and O
your O
sons O
will O
be O
in O
the O
house O
. O

Then O
pour O
the O
oil O
into O
all O
the O
bowls O
. O

Fill O
them O
, O
and O
put O
them O
in O
a O
separate O
place O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
woman O
left O
Elisha O
, O
went O
into O
her O
house O
, O
and O
shut O
the O
door O
. O

Only O
she O
and O
her O
sons O
were O
in O
the O
house O
. O

Her O
sons O
brought O
the O
bowls O
to O
her O
and O
she O
poured O
oil O
. O

She O
filled O
many O
bowls O
. O

Finally O
, O
she O
said O
to O
her O
son O
, O
`` O
Bring O
me O
another O
bowl O
. O
'' O

But O
all O
the O
bowls O
were O
full O
. O

One O
of O
the O
sons O
said O
to O
her O
, O
`` O
There O
are O
n't O
any O
more O
bowls O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
oil O
in O
the O
jar O
was O
finished O
! O

When O
she O
told O
the O
man O
of O
God O
what O
had O
happened O
, O
Elisha O
said O
to O
her O
, O
`` O
Go O
, O
sell O
the O
oil O
and O
pay O
your O
debt O
. O

You O
and O
your O
sons O
can O
live O
on O
the O
money O
that O
is O
left O
. O
'' O

One O
day O
Elisha O
went O
to O
Shunem O
, O
where O
an O
important O
woman O
lived O
. O

She O
asked O
Elisha O
to O
stop O
and O
eat O
at O
her O
house O
. O

So O
every O
time O
Elisha O
went O
through O
that O
place O
, O
he O
stopped O
there O
to O
eat O
. O

The O
woman O
said O
to O
her O
husband O
, O
`` O
Look O
, O
I O
can O
see O
that O
Elisha O
is O
a O
holy O
man O
of O
God O
. O

He O
passes O
by O
our O
house O
all O
the O
time O
. O

Please O
, O
let O
's O
make O
a O
little O
room O
on O
the O
roof O
for O
him O
. O

Let O
's O
put O
a O
bed O
in O
this O
room O
and O
a O
table O
, O
a O
chair O
, O
and O
a O
lampstand O
. O

Then O
when O
he O
comes O
to O
our O
house O
, O
he O
can O
have O
this O
room O
for O
himself O
. O
'' O

One O
day O
Elisha O
came O
to O
the O
woman O
's O
house O
. O

He O
went O
to O
this O
room O
and O
rested O
there O
. O

Elisha O
said O
to O
his O
servant O
Gehazi O
, O
`` O
Call O
this O
Shunammite O
woman O
. O
'' O

The O
servant O
called O
the O
Shunammite O
woman O
, O
and O
she O
stood O
in O
front O
of O
Elisha O
. O

Elisha O
told O
his O
servant O
, O
`` O
Now O
say O
to O
her O
, O
' O
Look O
, O
you O
have O
done O
your O
best O
to O
take O
care O
of O
us O
. O

What O
can O
we O
do O
for O
you O
? O

Do O
you O
want O
us O
to O
speak O
to O
the O
king O
for O
you O
, O
or O
to O
the O
captain O
of O
the O
army O
? O
' O
'' O

She O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
fine O
living O
here O
among O
my O
own O
people O
. O
'' O

Elisha O
said O
to O
Gehazi O
, O
`` O
What O
can O
we O
do O
for O
her O
? O
'' O

He O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
know O
! O

She O
does O
not O
have O
a O
son O
, O
and O
her O
husband O
is O
old O
. O
'' O

Then O
Elisha O
said O
, O
`` O
Call O
her O
. O
'' O

So O
Gehazi O
called O
the O
woman O
. O

She O
came O
and O
stood O
at O
his O
door O
. O

Elisha O
said O
, O
`` O
About O
this O
time O
next O
spring O
, O
you O
will O
be O
holding O
your O
own O
baby O
boy O
in O
your O
arms O
. O
'' O

The O
woman O
said O
, O
`` O
No O
, O
sir O
! O

Man O
of O
God O
, O
do O
n't O
lie O
to O
me O
! O
'' O

But O
the O
woman O
did O
become O
pregnant O
and O
gave O
birth O
to O
a O
son O
that O
next O
spring O
, O
just O
as O
Elisha O
had O
said O
. O

The O
boy O
grew O
. O

One O
day O
the O
boy O
went O
out O
into O
the O
fields O
to O
see O
his O
father O
and O
the O
men O
cutting O
the O
grain O
. O

The O
boy O
said O
to O
his O
father O
, O
`` O
Oh O
, O
my O
head O
! O

My O
head O
hurts O
! O
'' O

The O
father O
said O
to O
his O
servant O
, O
`` O
Carry O
him O
to O
his O
mother O
! O
'' O

The O
servant O
took O
the O
boy O
to O
his O
mother O
. O

The O
boy O
sat O
on O
his O
mother O
's O
lap O
until O
noon O
. O

Then O
he O
died O
. O

The O
woman O
laid O
the O
boy O
on O
the O
bed O
of O
Elisha O
, O
the O
man O
of O
God O
. O

Then O
she O
shut O
the O
door O
to O
that O
room O
and O
went O
outside O
. O

She O
called O
to O
her O
husband O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Please O
send O
me O
one O
of O
the O
servants O
and O
a O
donkey O
. O

Then O
I O
will O
go O
quickly O
to O
get O
the O
man O
of O
God O
and O
come O
back O
. O
'' O

The O
woman O
's O
husband O
said O
, O
`` O
Why O
would O
you O
want O
to O
go O
to O
the O
man O
of O
God O
today O
? O

It O
is O
n't O
the O
New O
Moon O
or O
Sabbath O
day O
. O
'' O

She O
said O
, O
`` O
Goodbye O
! O
'' O

Then O
she O
put O
a O
saddle O
on O
a O
donkey O
and O
said O
to O
her O
servant O
, O
`` O
Let O
's O
go O
, O
and O
hurry O
! O

Go O
slow O
only O
when O
I O
tell O
you O
. O
'' O

The O
woman O
went O
to O
Mount O
Carmel O
to O
get O
the O
man O
of O
God O
. O

The O
man O
of O
God O
saw O
the O
Shunammite O
woman O
coming O
from O
far O
away O
and O
said O
to O
his O
servant O
Gehazi O
, O
`` O
Look O
, O
there O
's O
the O
Shunammite O
woman O
! O

Please O
run O
now O
to O
meet O
her O
! O

Say O
to O
her O
, O
' O
Are O
you O
all O
right O
? O

Is O
your O
husband O
all O
right O
? O

Is O
the O
child O
all O
right O
? O
' O
'' O

She O
answered O
, O
`` O
Everything O
is O
all O
right O
. O
'' O

But O
the O
Shunammite O
woman O
went O
up O
the O
hill O
to O
the O
man O
of O
God O
. O

She O
bowed O
down O
and O
touched O
Elisha O
's O
feet O
. O

Gehazi O
came O
near O
to O
pull O
her O
away O
. O

But O
the O
man O
of O
God O
said O
to O
Gehazi O
, O
`` O
Leave O
her O
alone O
! O

She O
's O
very O
upset O
, O
and O
the O
Lord O
did O
n't O
tell O
me O
about O
it O
. O

The O
Lord O
hid O
this O
news O
from O
me O
. O
'' O

Then O
she O
said O
, O
`` O
Sir O
, O
I O
never O
asked O
for O
a O
son O
. O

I O
told O
you O
, O
' O
Do O
n't O
trick O
me O
! O
' O
'' O

Then O
Elisha O
said O
to O
Gehazi O
, O
`` O
Get O
ready O
to O
go O
. O

Take O
my O
walking O
stick O
and O
go O
! O

If O
you O
meet O
anyone O
along O
the O
way O
, O
do O
n't O
even O
stop O
to O
say O
hello O
to O
him O
. O

If O
anyone O
says O
hello O
to O
you O
, O
do O
n't O
answer O
. O

Put O
my O
walking O
stick O
on O
the O
child O
's O
face O
. O
'' O

But O
the O
child O
's O
mother O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
promise O
, O
as O
the O
Lord O
lives O
and O
as O
you O
live O
, O
I O
will O
not O
leave O
without O
you O
! O
'' O

So O
Elisha O
got O
up O
and O
followed O
her O
. O

Gehazi O
arrived O
at O
the O
house O
before O
Elisha O
and O
the O
Shunammite O
woman O
. O

Gehazi O
laid O
the O
walking O
stick O
on O
the O
child O
's O
face O
, O
but O
the O
child O
did O
not O
talk O
or O
show O
any O
sign O
that O
he O
heard O
anything O
. O

Then O
Gehazi O
came O
back O
to O
meet O
Elisha O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
child O
will O
not O
wake O
up O
! O
'' O

Elisha O
went O
into O
the O
house O
, O
and O
there O
was O
the O
child O
, O
lying O
dead O
on O
his O
bed O
. O

Elisha O
went O
into O
the O
room O
and O
shut O
the O
door O
. O

He O
and O
the O
child O
were O
alone O
in O
the O
room O
now O
. O

Then O
he O
prayed O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

Elisha O
went O
to O
the O
bed O
and O
lay O
on O
the O
child O
. O

He O
put O
his O
eyes O
on O
the O
child O
's O
eyes O
, O
his O
mouth O
on O
the O
child O
's O
mouth O
, O
and O
his O
hands O
on O
the O
child O
's O
hands O
. O

He O
lay O
there O
on O
top O
of O
the O
child O
until O
the O
child O
's O
body O
became O
warm O
. O

Then O
Elisha O
turned O
away O
and O
walked O
around O
the O
room O
. O

He O
went O
back O
and O
lay O
on O
the O
child O
until O
the O
child O
sneezed O
seven O
times O
and O
opened O
his O
eyes O
. O

Elisha O
called O
Gehazi O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Call O
the O
Shunammite O
woman O
! O
'' O

Gehazi O
called O
her O
, O
and O
she O
came O
to O
Elisha O
. O

Elisha O
said O
, O
`` O
Pick O
up O
your O
son O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
Shunammite O
woman O
went O
into O
the O
room O
and O
bowed O
down O
at O
Elisha O
's O
feet O
. O

Then O
she O
picked O
up O
her O
son O
and O
went O
out O
. O

Elisha O
went O
to O
Gilgal O
again O
. O

There O
was O
a O
famine O
in O
the O
land O
. O

The O
group O
of O
prophets O
was O
sitting O
in O
front O
of O
Elisha O
. O

Elisha O
said O
to O
his O
servant O
, O
`` O
Put O
the O
large O
pot O
on O
the O
fire O
, O
and O
make O
some O
soup O
for O
the O
group O
of O
prophets O
. O
'' O

One O
man O
went O
out O
into O
the O
field O
to O
gather O
herbs O
. O

He O
found O
a O
wild O
vine O
and O
picked O
the O
fruit O
from O
it O
. O

He O
put O
that O
fruit O
in O
his O
robe O
and O
brought O
it O
back O
. O

He O
cut O
up O
the O
wild O
fruit O
and O
put O
it O
into O
the O
pot O
. O

But O
the O
group O
of O
prophets O
did O
not O
know O
what O
kind O
of O
fruit O
it O
was O
. O

Then O
they O
poured O
some O
of O
the O
soup O
for O
the O
men O
to O
eat O
. O

But O
when O
they O
began O
to O
eat O
the O
soup O
, O
they O
shouted O
out O
, O
`` O
Man O
of O
God O
! O

There O
's O
poison O
in O
the O
pot O
! O
'' O

The O
food O
tasted O
like O
poison O
, O
so O
they O
could O
not O
eat O
that O
food O
. O

But O
Elisha O
said O
, O
`` O
Bring O
some O
flour O
. O
'' O

He O
threw O
the O
flour O
into O
the O
pot O
. O

Then O
he O
said O
, O
`` O
Pour O
the O
soup O
for O
the O
people O
so O
that O
they O
can O
eat O
. O
'' O

And O
there O
was O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
the O
soup O
. O

A O
man O
from O
Baal O
Shalishah O
came O
and O
brought O
bread O
from O
the O
first O
harvest O
to O
the O
man O
of O
God O
. O

This O
man O
brought O
20 O
loaves O
of O
barley O
bread O
and O
fresh O
grain O
in O
his O
sack O
. O

Then O
Elisha O
said O
, O
`` O
Give O
this O
food O
to O
the O
people O
, O
so O
that O
they O
can O
eat O
. O
'' O

Elisha O
's O
servant O
said O
, O
`` O
What O
? O

There O
are O
100 O
men O
here O
. O

How O
can O
I O
give O
this O
food O
to O
all O
those O
men O
? O
'' O

But O
Elisha O
said O
, O
`` O
Give O
the O
food O
to O
the O
people O

The O
Lord O
says O
, O
' O
They O
will O
eat O
and O
there O
will O
still O
be O
food O
left O
over O

'' O

Then O
Elisha O

servant O
put O
the O
food O
in O

of O
the O
group O
of O

had O
done O
. O

But O
he O
did O
not O

People O

made O

Zechariah O

Zechariah O
did O
what O

He O

In O
this O
way O
the O
Lord O
's O
word O
came O
true O
. O

He O
had O
told O
Jehu O
that O
four O
generations O
of O
his O
descendants O
would O
be O
kings O
of O
Israel O
. O

Shallum O
son O

Shallum O

Menahem O

Gadi O
came O
up O
from O
Tirzah O
to O
Samaria O

killed O
Shallum O
son O

Then O

area O
around O
it O
. O

The O
people O
refused O
to O
open O
the O
city O
gate O
for O
him O
. O

So O
Menahem O
defeated O
them O
and O
ripped O
open O
all O
the O
pregnant O
women O
in O
that O
city O
. O

Menahem O
son O

became O
king O
over O
Israel O

that O

Menahem O
ruled O
ten O

Menahem O
did O
what O

He O

. O

King O
Pul O
of O
Assyria O
came O
to O
fight O
against O
Israel O
. O

Menahem O
gave O
Pul O
75,000 O
pounds O
of O
silver O
so O
that O
Pul O
would O
support O
him O
and O
help O
him O
gain O
complete O
control O
of O
the O
kingdom O
. O

Menahem O
raised O
the O
money O
by O
making O
all O
the O
rich O
and O
powerful O
men O
pay O
taxes O
. O

He O
taxed O
each O
man O
20 O
ounces O
of O
silver O
and O
gave O
the O
money O
to O
the O
king O
of O

So O
the O

Assyria O
left O

but O
it O

Let O
's O
go O
to O
the O
Jordan O
River O

cut O
some O
wood O
. O

Each O
of O
us O
will O
get O
a O
log O

we O
will O
build O
us O
a O
place O

Elisha O
answered O
, O
`` O
Go O

'' O

One O
of O

said O
, O
`` O
Please O

Elisha O
said O
, O
`` O
Yes O

I O

So O
Elisha O
went O
with O
the O

When O
they O
arrived O
at O
the O
Jordan O
River O
, O
they O
began O
to O
cut O
down O
some O
trees O
. O

But O
when O
one O
man O
was O
cutting O
down O
a O
tree O
, O
the O
iron O
ax O
head O
slipped O
from O
the O

He O
shouted O
, O
`` O
Oh O

I O

The O
man O

The O
man O
showed O
Elisha O
the O
place O
where O
the O
ax O

Then O
Elisha O
cut O
a O
stick O

threw O
the O
stick O
into O

The O
stick O
made O
the O

Elisha O

`` O
So O

the O

out O

took O
the O
ax O
head O

The O
king O

He O
had O
a O

such O

But O
the O
man O

God O
sent O
a O

Elisha O
said O
, O
`` O
Be O

Do O

And O
the O
king O

Israel O
saved O
quite O
a O
few O
men O
. O

The O
king O
of O
Aram O
was O
very O
upset O
about O
this O
. O

He O
called O
his O
army O
officers O
and O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Tell O
me O

One O
of O
the O
officers O

said O
, O
`` O
My O
lord O

not O
one O

Elisha O

the O

from O

, O
can O
tell O
the O

many O
secret O
things O

even O
the O
words O
that O
you O
speak O
in O
your O
bedroom O
! O
'' O

The O
king O
of O
Aram O
said O
, O
`` O
Find O
Elisha O
, O
and O
I O
will O
send O
men O
to O
catch O
him O

'' O

The O
servants O
told O
the O
king O
of O
Aram O
, O
`` O
Elisha O
is O

Dothan O

'' O

Then O
the O
king O
of O
Aram O
sent O
horses O
, O
chariots O
, O
and O
a O
large O
army O
to O
Dothan O
. O

They O
arrived O
at O
night O
and O
surrounded O
the O
city O

Elisha O
's O
servant O
got O
up O
early O
that O
morning O
. O

When O
he O
went O
outside O
, O
he O
saw O
an O
army O
with O
horses O
and O
chariots O
all O
around O
the O
city O

The O
servant O
said O
to O
Elisha O
, O
`` O
Oh O
, O
my O
master O
, O
what O
can O
we O
do O
? O
'' O

Elisha O
said O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
be O
afraid O
. O

The O
army O
that O
fights O
for O
us O
is O
larger O
than O
the O
army O
that O

'' O

Then O
Elisha O
prayed O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
I O
ask O
you O
, O
open O
my O
servant O

The O
Lord O
opened O
the O

the O

They O
were O
all O

These O
horses O

came O
down O

He O
prayed O
to O
the O
Lord O

said O
, O
`` O
I O
pray O
that O
you O
will O
cause O
these O
people O

Then O
the O
Lord O
did O
what O
Elisha O
asked O
. O

He O
caused O
the O
Aramean O
army O

Elisha O
said O
to O
the O
Aramean O
army O
, O
`` O

I O

Then O
Elisha O
led O
them O
to O
Samaria O

When O
they O
arrived O
at O
Samaria O

Elisha O
said O
, O
`` O

Then O
the O
Lord O
opened O

the O
Aramean O

The O

Israel O
saw O
the O
Aramean O

said O
to O
Elisha O
, O
`` O
My O
father O
, O
should O
I O

Should O
I O
kill O
them O
? O

Elisha O
answered O
, O
`` O
No O
, O
do O

kill O
them O

You O
would O
not O
kill O
people O
who O
you O
captured O
in O
war O
with O
your O
sword O

Give O
the O
Aramean O

some O
bread O

Let O
them O
eat O

Then O
let O
them O
go O
home O

'' O

The O
king O

Israel O
prepared O
much O
food O
for O
the O
Aramean O

After O
they O
ate O

he O
sent O
them O
back O

The O
Arameans O
did O
not O
send O
any O
more O

After O

people O
bring O
food O
into O
the O
city O
, O
so O
there O
was O
a O
time O
of O
terrible O
hunger O
in O
Samaria O
. O

It O
was O
so O
bad O
in O
Samaria O
that O
a O
donkey O
's O
head O
was O
sold O
for O
80 O
pieces O
of O
silver O
and O
one O
pint O
of O
dove O
's O
dung O
sold O
for O
five O
pieces O
of O
silver O
. O

The O
king O
of O
Israel O
was O
walking O
on O
the O
wall O
around O
the O
city O
. O

A O
woman O
shouted O
out O
to O
him O
. O

She O
said O
, O
`` O
My O
lord O
and O
king O
, O
please O
help O
me O
! O
'' O

The O
king O
of O
Israel O
said O
, O
`` O
If O
the O
Lord O
does O
not O
help O
you O
, O
how O
can O
I O
help O
you O
? O

I O
can O
not O
give O
you O
grain O
from O
the O
threshing O
floor O
or O
wine O
from O
the O
winepress O
. O
'' O

Then O
he O
said O
to O
her O
, O
`` O
What O
is O
your O
trouble O
? O
'' O

She O
answered O
, O
`` O
This O
woman O
said O
to O
me O
, O
' O
Give O
me O
your O
son O
so O
that O
we O
can O
eat O
him O
today O
. O

Then O
we O
will O
eat O
my O
son O
tomorrow O
. O
' O

So O
we O
boiled O
my O
son O
and O
ate O
him O
. O

Then O
the O
next O
day O
, O
I O
said O
to O
this O
woman O
, O
' O
Give O
me O
your O
son O
so O
that O
we O
can O
eat O
him O
. O
' O

But O
she O
has O
hidden O
her O
son O
! O
'' O

When O
the O
king O
heard O
the O
woman O
's O
words O
, O
he O
tore O
his O
clothes O
to O
show O
he O
was O
upset O
. O

As O
he O
passed O
by O
on O
the O
wall O
, O
the O
people O
saw O
the O
king O
was O
wearing O
the O
rough O
cloth O
under O
his O
clothes O
to O
show O
he O
was O
sad O
and O
upset O
. O

The O
king O
said O
, O
`` O
May O
God O
punish O
me O
if O
the O
head O
of O
Elisha O
son O
of O
Shaphat O
is O
still O
on O
his O
body O
at O
the O
end O
of O
this O
day O

'' O

The O
king O
sent O
a O
messenger O
to O
Elisha O
. O

Elisha O
was O
sitting O
in O
his O
house O
, O
and O
the O
elders O
were O
sitting O
with O
him O
. O

Before O
the O
messenger O
arrived O
, O
Elisha O
said O
to O
the O
elders O
, O
`` O
Look O
, O
that O
son O
of O
a O
murderer O
is O
sending O
men O

off O
my O

When O
the O
messenger O
arrives O
, O
shut O
the O
door O

Hold O
the O
door O
and O
do O
n't O
let O
him O
in O

I O
hear O
the O
sound O
of O
his O
master O

feet O
coming O
behind O
him O

While O
Elisha O
was O
still O
talking O
with O
the O
elders O
, O
the O
messenger O
came O
to O
him O
. O

This O
was O
the O
message O
: O
`` O
This O
trouble O
has O
come O
from O
the O
Lord O

Why O
should O
I O
wait O
for O
the O
Lord O

'' O

Josiah O
was O
eight O
years O
old O
when O
he O
began O
to O
rule O
. O

He O
ruled O
31 O
years O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

His O
mother O
's O
name O
was O
Jedidah O
the O
daughter O
of O
Adaiah O
of O
Bozkath O
. O

Josiah O
did O
what O
the O
Lord O
said O
was O
right O
. O

He O
followed O
God O
like O
his O
ancestor O
David O
. O

Josiah O
obeyed O
God O
's O
teachings O
-- O
he O
did O
exactly O
what O
God O
wanted O
. O

During O
the O
18th O
year O
that O
Josiah O
was O
king O
, O
he O
sent O
Shaphan O
son O
of O
Azaliah O
son O
of O
Meshullam O
, O
the O
secretary O
, O
to O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O

Josiah O
said O
, O
`` O
Go O
up O
to O
Hilkiah O
the O
high O

Tell O
him O
that O
he O
must O
get O
the O
money O
that O
people O
brought O
to O
the O
Lord O

Temple O
. O

The O
gatekeepers O
collected O
that O
money O
from O
the O
people O
. O

The O
priests O
must O
use O
that O
money O
to O
pay O
the O
workers O
to O
repair O
the O
Lord O

Temple O

They O
must O
give O
that O
money O
to O
the O
men O
who O
supervise O
the O
work O
on O
the O
Lord O

Temple O

Use O
that O
money O
for O
the O
carpenters O
, O
stonemasons O
, O
and O
stonecutters O
. O

Also O
use O
that O
money O
to O
buy O
the O
timber O
and O
cut O
stones O
that O
are O
needed O
to O
repair O
the O
Temple O

Do O

count O
the O
money O

They O
can O
be O
trusted O

'' O

Hilkiah O
the O
high O
priest O
said O
to O
Shaphan O
the O
secretary O
, O
`` O
Look O
, O
I O
found O
the O
Book O

Law O

Lord O

Hilkiah O
gave O
the O
book O
to O
Shaphan O
, O
and O
Shaphan O
read O
it O
. O

He O
went O
to O
King O
Josiah O
and O
told O
him O
what O
happened O
. O

Shaphan O
said O
, O
`` O
Your O
servants O
have O
gathered O
all O
the O
money O
that O
was O

it O
to O
the O
men O
who O
supervise O

the O
Lord O

Then O
he O
told O
the O
king O
, O
`` O
And O
Hilkiah O
the O
priest O
also O
gave O
this O
book O
to O
me O

'' O

Then O
Shaphan O
read O
the O
book O
to O
the O
king O
. O

When O
the O
king O
heard O
the O
words O
of O
the O
Book O
of O
the O
Law O
, O
he O
tore O
his O
clothes O
to O
show O
he O
was O
sad O
and O
upset O
. O

Then O
he O
gave O
a O
command O
to O
Hilkiah O
the O
priest O
, O
Ahikam O
son O
of O
Shaphan O
, O
Acbor O
son O
of O
Micaiah O
, O
Shaphan O
the O
secretary O
, O
and O
Asaiah O
the O
king O

servant O

King O
Josiah O
said O
, O
`` O
Go O
and O
ask O
the O
Lord O
what O
we O
should O
do O
. O

Ask O
for O
me O
, O
for O
the O
people O
, O
and O
for O
all O
Judah O
. O

Ask O
about O
the O
words O
of O
this O
book O
that O
was O
found O
. O

The O
Lord O
is O
angry O
with O
us O
, O
because O
our O
ancestors O
did O
not O
listen O
to O
the O
words O
of O
this O
book O
. O

They O
did O
not O
obey O
all O
the O

'' O

So O
Hilkiah O
the O
priest O
, O
Ahikam O
, O
Acbor O
, O
Shaphan O
, O
and O
Asaiah O
went O
to O
Huldah O
the O
woman O
prophet O

Huldah O
was O
the O
wife O
of O
Shallum O
son O
of O
Tikvah O

son O

He O
took O

of O
the O
priests O

clothes O

Huldah O
was O
living O
in O
the O
second O
quarter O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

They O
went O
and O
talked O
with O
Huldah O

Then O
Huldah O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
The O
Lord O

the O
God O

I O
am O
bringing O
trouble O
on O
this O
place O
and O
on O
the O
people O
who O
live O
here O
. O

These O
are O
the O
troubles O
that O
are O
mentioned O
in O
the O
book O
that O
the O
king O
of O
Judah O
read O
. O

The O
people O
of O
Judah O
have O
left O
me O
and O
have O
burned O
incense O
to O
other O
gods O
. O

They O
made O
me O
very O
angry O
. O

They O
made O
many O
idols O
. O

That O
is O
why O
I O
will O
show O
my O
anger O
against O
this O
place O
. O

My O
anger O
will O
be O
like O
a O
fire O
that O
can O
not O
be O
stopped O

' O

`` O
King O
Josiah O
of O
Judah O
sent O
you O
to O
ask O
advice O
from O
the O
Lord O
. O

Tell O
Josiah O
this O
: O
' O
The O
Lord O
, O
the O
God O
of O
Israel O
, O
said O
the O
words O
that O
you O
heard O
. O

You O
heard O
what O
I O
said O
about O
this O
place O
and O
those O
who O
live O
here O
. O

Your O
heart O
was O
soft O
, O
and O
you O
felt O
sorry O
when O
you O
heard O
those O
things O
. O

I O
said O
that O
terrible O
things O
would O
happen O
to O
this O
place O
. O

You O
tore O
your O
clothes O
to O
show O
your O
sadness O
and O
you O
began O
to O
cry O
. O

That O
is O
why O
I O
heard O
you O
. O
' O

The O
Lord O
says O
this O
. O

' O
I O
will O
bring O
you O
to O
be O
with O
your O
ancestors O
. O

You O
will O
die O
and O
go O
to O
your O
grave O
in O
peace O
. O

So O
your O
eyes O
will O
not O
see O
all O
the O
trouble O
that O
I O
am O
bringing O
on O
this O
place O
. O
' O
'' O

Then O
Hilkiah O
the O
priest O
, O
Ahikam O
, O
Acbor O
, O
Shaphan O
, O
and O
Asaiah O
gave O
that O
message O
to O
the O
king O
. O

Hezekiah O
son O
of O
Ahaz O
was O
king O
of O
Judah O
. O

Hezekiah O
began O
to O
rule O
during O
the O
third O
year O
that O
Hoshea O
son O
of O
Elah O
was O
king O
of O
Israel O
. O

Hezekiah O
was O
25 O
years O
old O
when O
he O
began O
to O
rule O
. O

He O
ruled O
29 O
years O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

His O
mother O
's O
name O
was O
Abi O
, O
the O
daughter O
of O
Zechariah O
. O

Hezekiah O
did O
what O
the O
Lord O
said O
was O
right O
, O
just O
as O
David O
his O
ancestor O
had O
done O
. O

Hezekiah O
destroyed O
the O
high O
places O
. O

He O
broke O
the O
memorial O
stones O
and O
cut O
down O
the O
Asherah O
poles O
. O

At O
that O
time O
the O
Israelites O
burned O
incense O
to O
the O
bronze O
snake O
made O
by O
Moses O
. O

This O
bronze O
snake O
was O
called O
`` O
Nehushtan O
. O
'' O

Hezekiah O
broke O
this O
bronze O
snake O
into O
pieces O
. O

Hezekiah O
trusted O
in O
the O
Lord O
, O
the O
God O
of O
Israel O
. O

There O
was O
no O
one O
like O
Hezekiah O
among O
all O
the O
kings O
of O
Judah O
before O
him O
or O
after O
him O
. O

He O
was O
very O
faithful O
to O
the O
Lord O
and O
did O
not O
stop O
following O
him O
. O

He O
obeyed O
the O
commands O
that O
the O
Lord O
had O
given O
to O
Moses O
. O

The O
Lord O
was O
with O
Hezekiah O
, O
so O
he O
was O
successful O
in O
everything O
he O
did O
. O

Hezekiah O
broke O
away O
from O
the O
king O
of O
Assyria O
and O
stopped O
serving O
him O
. O

Hezekiah O
defeated O
the O
Philistines O
all O
the O
way O
to O
Gaza O
and O
the O
area O
around O
it O
. O

He O
defeated O
all O
the O
Philistine O
cities O
-- O
from O
the O
smallest O
town O
to O
the O
largest O
city O
. O

King O
Shalmaneser O
of O
Assyria O
went O
to O
fight O
against O
Samaria O
. O

His O
army O
surrounded O
the O
city O
. O

This O
happened O
during O
the O
fourth O
year O
that O
Hezekiah O
was O
king O
of O
Judah O
. O

-LRB- O
This O
was O
also O
the O
seventh O
year O
that O
Hoshea O
son O
of O
Elah O
was O
king O
of O
Israel O
. O
-RRB- O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
third O
year O
Shalmaneser O
captured O
Samaria O
. O

He O
took O
Samaria O
during O
the O
sixth O
year O
that O
Hezekiah O
was O
king O
of O
Judah O
. O

-LRB- O
This O
was O
also O
the O
ninth O
year O
that O
Hoshea O
was O
king O
of O
Israel O
. O
-RRB- O

The O
king O
of O
Assyria O
took O
the O
Israelites O
as O
prisoners O
to O
Assyria O
. O

He O
made O
them O
live O
in O
Halah O
, O
on O
the O
Habor O
-LRB- O
the O
river O
of O
Gozan O
-RRB- O
, O
and O
in O
the O
cities O
of O
the O
Medes O
. O

This O
happened O
because O
the O
Israelites O
did O
not O
obey O
the O
Lord O
their O
God O
. O

They O
broke O
his O
agreement O
and O
did O
not O
obey O
everything O
that O
Moses O
, O
the O
Lord O
's O
servant O
, O
had O
commanded O
. O

The O
Israelites O
would O
not O
listen O
to O
the O
Lord O
's O
agreement O
, O
or O
do O
what O
it O
taught O
them O
to O
do O
. O

During O
Hezekiah O
's O
14th O
year O
as O
king O
, O
King O
Sennacherib O
of O
Assyria O
went O
to O
fight O
against O
all O
the O
strong O
cities O
of O
Judah O
. O

Sennacherib O
defeated O
them O
all O
. O

Then O
King O
Hezekiah O
of O
Judah O
sent O
a O
message O
to O
the O
king O
of O
Assyria O
at O
Lachish O
. O

Hezekiah O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
have O
done O
wrong O
. O

Leave O
me O
alone O
, O
and O
I O
will O
pay O
whatever O
you O
want O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
king O
of O
Assyria O
told O
King O
Hezekiah O
of O
Judah O
to O
pay O
over O
11 O
tons O
of O
silver O
and O
over O
1 O
ton O
of O
gold O
. O

Hezekiah O
gave O
all O
the O
silver O
that O
was O
in O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
and O
in O
the O
king O
's O
treasuries O
. O

That O
is O
when O
Hezekiah O
cut O
off O
the O
gold O
that O
he O
had O
put O
on O
the O
doors O
and O
doorposts O
of O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
and O
gave O
it O
to O
the O
king O
of O
Assyria O
. O

The O
king O
of O
Assyria O
sent O
his O
three O
most O
important O
officers O
with O
a O
large O
army O
to O
King O
Hezekiah O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

They O
left O
Lachish O
and O
went O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

They O
stood O
near O
the O
aqueduct O
by O
the O
Upper O
Pool O
, O
on O
the O
street O
that O
leads O
up O
to O
Laundryman O
's O
Field O
. O

These O
men O
called O
for O
the O
king O
, O
but O
Eliakim O
son O
of O
Hilkiah O
, O
Shebna O
, O
and O
Joah O
son O
of O
Asaph O
went O
out O
to O
meet O
them O
. O

Eliakim O
was O
the O
palace O
manager O
, O
Joah O
was O
the O
record O
keeper O
, O
and O
Shebna O
was O
the O
royal O
secretary O
. O

The O
commander O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Tell O
Hezekiah O
this O
is O
what O
the O
great O
king O
, O
the O
king O
of O
Assyria O
says O
: O
' O
What O
are O
you O
trusting O
in O
to O
help O
you O
? O

If O
you O
say O
, O
`` O
I O
trust O
in O
power O
and O
great O
battle O
plans O
, O
'' O
then O
that O
is O
useless O
. O

Now O
I O
ask O
you O
, O
who O
do O
you O
trust O
so O
much O
that O
you O
are O
willing O
to O
rebel O
against O
me O
? O

Are O
you O
depending O
on O
Egypt O
to O
help O
you O
? O

Egypt O
is O
like O
a O
broken O
walking O
stick O
. O

If O
you O
lean O
on O
it O
for O
support O
, O
it O
will O
only O
hurt O
you O
and O
make O
a O
hole O
in O
your O
hand O
. O

Pharaoh O
, O
the O
king O
of O
Egypt O
, O
can O
not O
be O
trusted O
by O
anyone O
who O
depends O
on O
him O
for O
help O
. O

Maybe O
you O
will O
say O
, O
`` O
We O
trust O
the O
Lord O
our O
God O
to O
help O
us O
. O
'' O

But O
I O
know O
that O
Hezekiah O
destroyed O
the O
altars O
and O
high O
places O
where O
people O
worshiped O
the O
Lord O
. O

Hezekiah O
told O
the O
people O
of O
Judah O
and O
Jerusalem O
, O
`` O
You O
must O
worship O
only O
at O
this O
one O
altar O
here O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O
'' O

' O
If O
you O
still O
want O
to O
fight O
my O
master O
, O
the O
king O
of O
Assyria O
, O
I O
will O
make O
this O
agreement O
with O
you O
. O

I O
promise O
that O
I O
will O
give O
you O
2000 O
horses O
if O
you O
can O
find O
enough O
men O
to O
ride O
them O
into O
battle O
. O

But O
even O
then O
you O
could O
n't O
beat O
one O
of O
my O
master O
's O
lowest O
ranking O
officers O
. O

So O
why O
do O
you O
still O
depend O
on O
Egypt O
's O
chariots O
and O
horse O
soldiers O
? O

' O
Now O
, O
do O
you O
think O
I O
came O
to O
this O
country O
to O
destroy O
it O
without O
the O
Lord O
's O
help O
? O

No O
, O
the O
Lord O
said O
to O
me O
, O
`` O
Go O
up O
against O
this O
country O
and O
destroy O
it O
! O
' O
' O
' O
'' O

Then O
Eliakim O
son O
of O
Hilkiah O
, O
Shebna O
, O
and O
Joah O
said O
to O
the O
commander O
, O
`` O
Please O
speak O
to O
us O
in O
Aramaic O
. O

We O
understand O
that O
language O
. O

Do O
n't O
speak O
to O
us O
in O
the O
language O
of O
Judah O
because O
the O
people O
on O
the O
wall O
will O
understand O
you O
. O
'' O

But O
the O
commander O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
My O
master O
did O
not O
send O
me O
to O
speak O
only O
to O
you O
and O
your O
master O

I O
was O
also O
sent O
to O
speak O
to O
those O
people O
sitting O
on O
the O
wall O

They O
, O
too O
, O
will O
not O
have O
enough O
food O
or O
water O
; O
they O
, O
too O
, O
will O
eat O
their O
own O
waste O
and O
drink O
their O
own O
urine O
like O
you O
! O
'' O

Then O
the O
commander O
shouted O
loudly O
in O
Hebrew O
, O
`` O
Hear O
this O
message O
from O
the O
great O
king O
, O
the O
king O
of O
Assyria O

The O
king O
says O
, O
' O
Do O
n't O
let O
Hezekiah O
fool O
you O

because O
he O
can O
not O

you O

my O
power O
. O

Do O
n't O
let O
Hezekiah O
make O
you O
trust O
in O
the O
Lord O
. O
' O

Hezekiah O
says O
, O
' O
The O
Lord O
will O
save O
us O
. O

The O
king O
of O
Assyria O
will O
not O
defeat O
this O
city O

' O

But O
do O
n't O
listen O
to O
Hezekiah O
. O

The O
king O
of O
Assyria O
says O
this O
: O
' O
Do O
this O
favor O
for O
me O
; O
come O
out O
to O
me O
and O
then O
everyone O

own O
vines O

figs O
from O
their O
own O
trees O
, O
and O
water O
from O
their O
own O
well O

You O
can O
do O
this O
until O
I O
come O
and O
take O
you O
away O
to O
a O
land O
like O
your O
own O
. O

In O
that O
new O
land O
, O
you O
will O
have O
good O
grain O
and O
new O
wine O
, O
bread O
, O
vineyards O
, O
olive O
oil O
, O
and O
honey O
. O

Then O
you O
can O
live O
and O
not O
die O
. O

But O
do O
n't O
listen O
to O
Hezekiah O
. O

He O
is O
trying O
to O
change O
your O
mind O
. O

He O
is O
saying O
, O
`` O
The O
Lord O

save O
us O

Did O
any O
of O
the O
gods O
of O
the O
other O
nations O

their O
land O
from O
the O
king O
of O

Where O

Where O

Did O

Did O
any O

No O

So O
do O
you O
think O
the O
Lord O
will O
save O
Jerusalem O

me O

' O
'' O

But O
the O
people O
were O
silent O
. O

They O
did O
not O
say O
a O
word O
to O
the O
commander O
because O
King O
Hezekiah O
had O
commanded O
them O
, O
`` O
Do O

say O
anything O

him O

Then O
the O
palace O
manager O

Eliakim O
son O
of O
Hilkiah O
-RRB- O
, O
the O
royal O
secretary O
-LRB- O

-RRB- O
, O
and O
the O
record O
keeper O
-LRB- O
Joah O
son O

Asaph O
-RRB- O
went O
to O
Hezekiah O
. O

Their O
clothes O
were O
torn O
to O
show O
they O
were O
upset O
. O

They O
told O
Hezekiah O
everything O
the O
Assyrian O
commander O
had O
said O
. O

Elisha O
said O
, O
`` O
Listen O
to O
the O
message O
from O

The O
Lord O
says O
, O

About O
this O

tomorrow O

there O
will O

plenty O

it O

cheap O
again O

A O
person O
will O
be O
able O
to O
buy O
a O
basket O
of O
fine O
flour O
or O
two O
baskets O
of O
barley O
for O
only O
one O
shekel O
in O
the O
marketplace O
by O
the O
city O
gates O
of O
Samaria O
. O
' O
'' O

Then O
the O
officer O
who O
was O
close O
to O
the O
king O
answered O
the O
man O
of O
God O
. O

The O
officer O
said O
, O
`` O
Even O
if O
the O
Lord O
made O
windows O
in O
heaven O
, O
this O
could O
not O
happen O

Elisha O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
will O
see O
it O
with O
your O
own O
eyes O
, O
but O
you O
will O
not O
eat O
any O
of O
that O
food O
. O
'' O

There O
were O
four O
men O
sick O
with O
leprosy O
near O
the O
city O
gate O
. O

They O
said O
to O
each O
other O
, O
`` O
Why O
are O
we O
sitting O
here O
waiting O
to O
die O
? O

There O
is O
no O
food O
in O
Samaria O
. O

If O
we O
go O
into O
the O
city O
, O
we O
will O
die O
there O
. O

If O
we O
stay O
here O
, O
we O
will O
also O
die O
. O

So O
let O
's O
go O
to O
the O
Aramean O
camp O
. O

If O
they O
let O
us O
live O
, O
we O
will O
live O
. O

If O
they O
kill O
us O
, O
we O
will O
just O
die O
. O
'' O

So O
that O
evening O
the O
four O
lepers O
went O
to O
the O
Aramean O
camp O
. O

When O
they O
came O
to O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
camp O
, O
no O
one O
was O
there O
! O

The O
Lord O
had O
caused O
the O
Aramean O
army O
to O
hear O
the O
sound O
of O
chariots O
, O
horses O
, O
and O
a O
large O
army O
. O

So O
the O
Aramean O
soldiers O
said O
to O
each O
other O
, O
`` O
The O
king O
of O
Israel O
has O
hired O
the O
kings O
of O
the O
Hittites O
and O
Egyptians O
to O
come O
against O
us O
. O
'' O

The O
Arameans O
ran O
away O
early O
that O
evening O
. O

They O
left O
everything O
behind O
. O

They O
left O
their O
tents O
, O
horses O
, O
and O
donkeys O
and O
ran O
for O
their O
lives O
. O

When O
these O
lepers O
came O
to O
where O
the O
camp O
began O
, O
they O
went O
into O
one O
tent O
. O

They O
ate O
and O
drank O
. O

Then O
they O
carried O
silver O
, O
gold O
, O
and O
clothes O
out O
of O
the O
camp O
and O
hid O
them O
. O

Then O
they O
came O
back O
and O
entered O
another O
tent O
. O

They O
carried O
things O
out O
from O
this O
tent O
and O
went O
out O
and O
hid O
them O
. O

Then O
they O
said O
to O
each O
other O
, O
`` O
We O
are O
doing O
wrong O
! O

Today O
we O
have O
good O
news O
, O
but O
we O
are O
silent O
. O

If O
we O
wait O
until O
the O
sun O
comes O
up O
, O
we O
will O
be O
punished O
. O

Now O
let O
's O
go O
and O
tell O
the O
people O
who O
live O
in O
the O
king O
's O
palace O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
lepers O
came O
and O
called O
to O
the O
gatekeepers O
of O
the O
city O
. O

They O
told O
the O
gatekeepers O
, O
`` O
We O
went O
to O
the O
Aramean O
camp O
, O
but O
we O
did O
not O
hear O
anyone O
. O

No O
one O
was O
there O
, O
but O
the O
horses O
and O
donkeys O
were O
still O
tied O
up O
, O
and O
the O
tents O
were O
still O
standing O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
gatekeepers O
of O
the O
city O
shouted O
out O
and O
told O
the O
people O
in O
the O
king O
's O
palace O
. O

It O
was O
night O
, O
but O
the O
king O
got O
up O
from O
bed O
and O
said O
to O
his O
officers O
, O
`` O
I O
will O
tell O
you O
what O
the O
Aramean O
soldiers O
are O
doing O
to O
us O
. O

They O
know O
we O
are O
hungry O
. O

They O
left O
the O
camp O
to O
hide O
in O
the O
field O
. O

They O
are O
thinking O
, O
' O
When O
the O
Israelites O
come O
out O
of O
the O
city O
, O
we O
will O
capture O
them O
alive O
. O

And O
then O
we O
will O
enter O
the O
city O
. O
' O
'' O

One O
of O
the O
king O
's O
officers O
said O
, O
`` O
Let O
some O
men O
take O
five O
of O
the O
horses O
that O
are O
still O
left O
in O
the O
city O
. O

The O
horses O
will O
soon O
die O
anyway O
, O
just O
as O
all O
the O
Israelites O
who O
are O
still O
left O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Let O
's O
send O
these O
men O
to O
see O
what O
happened O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
men O
took O
two O
chariots O
with O
horses O
. O

The O
king O
sent O
these O
men O
after O
the O
Aramean O
army O
. O

He O
told O
them O
, O
`` O
Go O
and O
see O
what O
happened O
. O
'' O

The O
men O
went O
after O
the O
Aramean O
army O
as O
far O
as O
the O
Jordan O
River O
. O

All O
along O
the O
road O
there O
were O
clothes O
and O
weapons O
. O

The O
Arameans O
had O
thrown O
these O
things O
down O
when O
they O
hurried O
away O
. O

The O
messengers O
went O
back O
to O
Samaria O
and O
told O
the O
king O
. O

Then O
the O
people O
ran O
out O
to O
the O
Aramean O
camp O
and O
took O
valuable O
things O
from O
there O
. O

So O
it O
happened O
just O
as O
the O
Lord O
had O
said O
. O

A O
person O
could O
buy O
a O
basket O
of O
fine O
flour O
or O
two O
baskets O
of O
barley O
for O
only O
one O
shekel O
. O

There O
was O
one O
officer O
who O
always O
stayed O
close O
by O
the O
king O
to O
help O
him O
. O

The O
king O
sent O
this O
officer O
to O
guard O
the O
gate O
, O
but O
the O
people O
knocked O
him O
down O
and O
trampled O
him O
, O
and O
he O
died O
. O

So O
everything O
happened O
just O
as O
the O
man O
of O
God O
had O
said O
when O
the O
king O
came O
to O
Elisha O
's O
house O
. O

Elisha O
had O
said O
, O
`` O
A O
person O
will O
be O
able O
to O
buy O
a O
basket O
of O
fine O

two O

for O
only O
one O
shekel O
in O
the O

by O
the O

of O
Samaria O

'' O

But O
that O
officer O
had O
answered O
the O
man O
of O
God O
, O
`` O
Even O
if O
the O
Lord O
made O
windows O
in O

, O
this O
could O
not O
happen O
! O
'' O

And O
Elisha O
had O
told O
the O
officer O
, O
`` O
You O
will O
see O
it O
with O
your O
own O
eyes O
, O
but O
you O
will O
not O
eat O

that O
food O

'' O

It O
happened O
to O
the O
officer O
just O
that O
way O
. O

The O
people O
knocked O
him O
down O
at O
the O
gate O
and O
trampled O
him O
, O
and O
he O
died O
. O

Jehoahaz O
son O
of O
Jehu O
became O
king O
over O
Israel O
in O
Samaria O
. O

This O
was O
during O
the O
23rd O
year O
that O
Joash O
son O
of O
Ahaziah O
was O
king O
in O
Judah O
. O

Jehoahaz O
ruled O
17 O
years O
. O

Jehoahaz O
did O
what O
the O
Lord O
said O
was O
wrong O
. O

He O
followed O
the O
sins O
of O
Jeroboam O
son O
of O
Nebat O
who O
caused O
Israel O
to O
sin O
. O

Jehoahaz O
did O
not O
stop O
doing O
those O
things O
. O

Then O
the O
Lord O
was O
angry O
with O
Israel O
. O

He O
let O
King O
Hazael O
of O
Aram O
and O
Hazael O
's O
son O
Ben-Hadad O
gain O
control O
of O
Israel O
. O

Then O
Jehoahaz O
begged O
the O
Lord O
to O
help O
them O
, O
and O
the O
Lord O
listened O
to O
him O
. O

The O
Lord O
had O
seen O
the O
troubles O
of O
Israel O
and O
how O
the O
king O
of O
Aram O
troubled O
the O
Israelites O
. O

So O
the O
Lord O
sent O
a O
man O
to O
save O
Israel O
. O

The O
Israelites O
were O
free O
from O
the O
Arameans O
. O

So O
the O
Israelites O
went O
to O
their O
own O
homes O
, O
as O
they O
did O
before O
. O

But O
the O
Israelites O
still O
did O
not O
stop O
committing O
the O
sins O
of O
the O
family O
of O
Jeroboam O
that O
caused O
Israel O
to O
sin O
. O

The O
Israelites O
continued O
committing O
the O
sins O
of O
Jeroboam O
. O

They O
also O
kept O
the O
Asherah O
poles O
in O
Samaria O
. O

The O
king O
of O
Aram O
defeated O
Jehoahaz O
's O
army O
and O
destroyed O
most O
of O
the O
men O
in O
the O
army O
. O

He O
left O
only O
50 O
horse O
soldiers O
, O
10 O
chariots O
, O
and O
10,000 O
foot O
soldiers O
. O

Jehoahaz O
's O
soldiers O
were O
like O
chaff O
blown O
away O
by O
the O
wind O
at O
the O
time O
of O
threshing O

All O
the O

him O

Elisha O

King O
Jehoash O

Jehoash O
cried O

said O
, O
`` O

Is O

Elisha O

`` O
Take O

and O
some O

'' O

Jehoash O
took O

Then O
Elisha O
said O
to O
the O
king O
of O
Israel O
, O
`` O
Put O
your O
hand O
on O
the O
bow O

'' O

Jehoash O
put O
his O

on O
the O

Then O
Elisha O
put O
his O
hands O
on O
the O
king O
's O
hands O
. O

Elisha O
said O
, O
`` O
Open O
the O
east O
window O

'' O

Jehoash O
opened O
the O
window O
. O

Then O
Elisha O
said O
, O
`` O
Shoot O
. O
'' O

Jehoash O
shot O
. O

Then O
Elisha O
said O
, O
`` O
This O
is O
the O
Lord O
's O
arrow O
of O
victory O
over O
Aram O
! O

You O
will O
defeat O
the O
Arameans O
at O
Aphek O
until O
you O
destroy O
them O

'' O

Elisha O
said O
, O
`` O
Take O
the O
arrows O
. O
'' O

Jehoash O
took O
the O
arrows O
. O

Then O
Elisha O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Hit O

the O
ground O

'' O

Jehoash O
hit O
the O
ground O
three O
times O

Then O
he O
stopped O
. O

The O
man O
of O
God O
was O
angry O
with O
Jehoash O
. O

Elisha O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
should O
have O
hit O
five O
or O
six O
times O
! O

Then O
you O
would O
have O
defeated O
Aram O

you O
destroyed O
it O

But O
now O
, O
you O
will O
defeat O
Aram O
only O
three O
times O

'' O

Elisha O
died O
, O
and O
the O
people O
buried O
him O
. O

One O
time O
in O
the O
spring O
a O
group O
of O
Moabite O
soldiers O
came O
to O
fight O
against O
Israel O
. O

Some O
Israelites O
were O
burying O
a O
dead O
man O
when O
they O
saw O
that O
group O
of O
soldiers O
. O

The O
Israelites O
quickly O
threw O
the O
dead O
man O
into O
Elisha O
's O
grave O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
the O
dead O
man O
touched O
the O
bones O
of O
Elisha O
, O
he O
came O
back O
to O
life O
and O
stood O
up O
on O
his O
feet O
. O

During O
all O
the O
days O
that O
Jehoahaz O
ruled O
, O
King O
Hazael O
of O
Aram O
caused O
trouble O
to O
Israel O
. O

But O
the O
Lord O
was O
kind O
to O
the O
Israelites O
. O

The O
Lord O
had O
mercy O
and O
turned O
to O
the O
Israelites O
, O
because O
of O
his O
agreement O
with O
Abraham O
, O
Isaac O
, O
and O
Jacob O
. O

The O
Lord O
would O
not O
destroy O
the O
Israelites O
or O
throw O
them O
away O
yet O
. O

King O
Hazael O
of O
Aram O
died O
, O
and O
Ben-Hadad O
became O
the O
new O
king O
after O
him O
. O

Before O
he O
died O
, O
Hazael O
had O
taken O
some O
cities O
in O
war O
from O
Jehoahaz O
, O
Jehoash O
's O
father O
. O

But O
now O
Jehoash O
took O
back O
these O
cities O
from O
Hazael O
's O
son O
Ben-Hadad O
. O

Jehoash O
defeated O
Ben-Hadad O
three O
times O
and O
took O
back O
the O
cities O
of O
Israel O
. O

King O
Josiah O
told O
all O
the O
leaders O
of O
Judah O
and O
Jerusalem O
to O
come O
and O
meet O
with O
him O
. O

Then O
the O
king O
went O
up O
to O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
. O

All O
the O
people O
of O
Judah O
and O
the O
people O
who O
lived O
in O
Jerusalem O
went O
with O
him O
. O

The O
priests O
, O
the O
prophets O
, O
and O
all O
the O
people O
-- O
from O
the O
least O
important O
to O
the O
most O
important O
-- O
went O
with O
him O
. O

Then O
he O
read O
the O
Book O
of O
the O
Agreement O
. O

This O
was O
the O
Book O
of O
the O
Law O
that O
was O
found O
in O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
. O

Josiah O
read O
the O
book O
so O
that O
all O
the O
people O
could O
hear O
it O
. O

The O
king O
stood O
by O
the O
column O
and O
made O
an O
agreement O
with O
the O
Lord O
. O

He O
promised O
to O
follow O
the O
Lord O
and O
to O
obey O
his O
commands O
, O
the O
laws O
, O
and O
his O
rules O
. O

He O
promised O
to O
do O
this O
with O
all O
his O
heart O
and O
soul O
. O

He O
promised O
to O
obey O
the O
agreement O
written O
in O
this O
book O
. O

All O
the O
people O
stood O
to O
show O
that O
they O
promised O
to O
follow O
the O
agreement O
. O

Then O
the O
king O
commanded O
Hilkiah O
the O
high O
priest O
, O
the O
other O
priests O
, O
and O
the O
gatekeepers O
to O
bring O
out O
of O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
all O
the O
dishes O
and O
things O
that O
were O
made O
to O
honor O
Baal O
, O
Asherah O
, O
and O
the O
stars O
of O
heaven O
. O

Then O
Josiah O
burned O
those O
things O
outside O
Jerusalem O
in O
the O
fields O
in O
Kidron O
Valley O
. O

Then O
they O
carried O
the O
ashes O
to O
Bethel O
. O

The O
kings O
of O
Judah O
had O
chosen O
some O
ordinary O
men O
to O
serve O
as O
priests O
. O

These O
false O
priests O
were O
burning O
incense O
at O
the O
high O
places O
in O
every O
city O
of O
Judah O
and O
all O
the O
towns O
around O
Jerusalem O
. O

They O
burned O
incense O
to O
honor O
Baal O
, O
the O
sun O
, O
the O
moon O
, O
the O
constellations O
, O
and O
all O
the O
stars O
in O
the O
sky O
. O

But O
Josiah O
stopped O
those O
false O
priests O
. O

Josiah O
removed O
the O
Asherah O
pole O
from O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
. O

He O
took O
the O
Asherah O
pole O
outside O
the O
city O
to O
the O
Kidron O
Valley O
and O
burned O
it O
there O
. O

Then O
he O
beat O
the O
burned O
pieces O
into O
dust O
and O
scattered O
the O
dust O
over O
the O
graves O
of O
the O
common O
people O
. O

Then O
King O
Josiah O
broke O
down O
the O
houses O
of O
the O
male O
prostitutes O
who O
were O
in O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
. O

Women O
also O
used O
these O
houses O
and O
made O
little O
tent O
covers O
to O
honor O
the O
false O
goddess O
Asherah O
. O

At O
that O
time O
the O
priests O
did O
not O
bring O
the O
sacrifices O
to O
Jerusalem O
and O
offer O
them O
on O
the O
altar O
in O
the O
Temple O
. O

The O
priests O
lived O
in O
cities O
all O
over O
Judah O
. O

They O
burned O
incense O
and O
offered O
sacrifices O
at O
the O
high O
places O
in O
those O
cities O
. O

The O
high O
places O
were O
everywhere O
, O
from O
Geba O
to O
Beersheba O
. O

And O
the O
priests O
ate O
their O
unleavened O
bread O
in O
those O
towns O
with O
the O
ordinary O
people O
-- O
not O
at O
the O
special O
place O
for O
priests O
in O
the O
Temple O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

But O
King O
Josiah O
ruined O
the O
high O
places O
and O
brought O
the O
priests O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

Josiah O
also O
destroyed O
the O
high O
places O
that O
were O
on O
the O
left O
side O
of O
the O
city O
gate O
, O
by O
the O
Gate O
of O
Joshua O

-LRB- O
Joshua O
was O
the O

-RRB- O

Topheth O
was O
a O
place O
in O
the O
Valley O
of O
Hinnom O
's O
Son O
where O
people O
killed O
their O
children O
and O
burned O
them O
on O
an O
altar O
to O
honor O
the O
false O
god O
Molech O
. O

Josiah O
ruined O
that O
place O
so O
that O
no O
one O
could O
use O
it O
again O
. O

In O
the O
past O
the O
kings O
of O
Judah O
had O
put O
some O
horses O
and O
a O
chariot O
near O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
. O

This O
was O
near O
the O
room O
of O
an O
important O
official O
named O
Nathan O
Melech O
. O

The O
horses O
and O
chariot O
were O
to O
honor O
the O
sun O
god O
. O

Josiah O
removed O
the O
horses O
and O
burned O
the O
chariot O
. O

In O
the O
past O
the O
kings O
of O
Judah O
had O
built O
altars O
on O
the O
roof O
of O
Ahab O
's O
building O
. O

King O
Manasseh O
had O
also O
built O
altars O
in O
the O
two O
courtyards O
of O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
. O

Josiah O
destroyed O
all O
the O
altars O
and O
threw O
the O
broken O
pieces O
into O
the O
Kidron O
Valley O
. O

In O
the O
past O
King O
Solomon O
built O
some O
high O
places O
on O
Destroyer O
Hill O
near O
Jerusalem O
. O

The O
high O
places O
were O
on O
the O
south O
side O
of O
that O
hill O
. O

King O
Solomon O
built O
one O
of O
these O
places O
of O
worship O
to O
honor O
Ashtoreth O
, O
that O
horrible O
thing O
the O
people O
of O
Sidon O
worship O
. O

He O
also O
built O
one O
to O
honor O
Chemosh O
, O
that O
horrible O
thing O
the O
Moabites O
worship O
. O

And O
King O
Solomon O
built O
one O
high O
place O
to O
honor O
Milcom O
, O
that O
horrible O
thing O
the O
Ammonites O
worship O
. O

But O
King O
Josiah O
ruined O
all O
these O
places O
of O
worship O
. O

He O
broke O
all O
the O
memorial O
stones O
and O
Asherah O
poles O
. O

Then O
he O
scattered O
dead O
men O
's O
bones O
over O
that O
place O
. O

Josiah O
also O
broke O
down O
the O
altar O
and O
high O
place O
at O
Bethel O
. O

Jeroboam O
son O
of O
Nebat O
had O
made O
this O
altar O
. O

Jeroboam O
caused O
Israel O
to O
sin O
. O

Josiah O
broke O
down O
both O
that O
altar O
and O
the O
high O
place O
. O

He O
broke O
the O
stones O
of O
the O
altar O
to O
pieces O
. O

Then O
he O
beat O
it O
into O
dust O
and O
he O
burned O
the O
Asherah O
pole O
. O

Josiah O
looked O
around O
and O
saw O
graves O
on O
the O
mountain O
. O

He O
sent O
men O
, O
and O
they O
took O
the O
bones O
from O
the O
graves O
. O

Then O
he O
burned O
the O
bones O
on O
the O
altar O
. O

In O
this O
way O
Josiah O
ruined O
the O
altar O
. O

This O
happened O
according O
to O
the O
message O
from O
the O
Lord O
that O
the O
man O
of O
God O
announced O
. O

The O
man O
of O
God O
announced O
these O
things O
when O
Jeroboam O
stood O
beside O
the O
altar O
at O
the O
feast O
. O

Then O
Josiah O
looked O
around O
and O
saw O
the O
grave O
of O
the O
man O
of O
God O
. O

Josiah O
said O
, O
`` O
What O
is O
that O
monument O
I O
see O
? O
'' O

The O
people O
of O
the O
city O
told O
him O
, O
`` O
It O
is O
the O
grave O
of O
the O
man O
of O
God O
who O
came O
from O
Judah O
. O

This O
man O
of O
God O
told O
about O
the O
things O
you O
have O
done O
to O
the O
altar O
at O
Bethel O
. O

He O
said O
them O
a O
long O
time O
ago O
. O
'' O

Josiah O
said O
, O
`` O
Leave O
the O
man O
of O
God O
alone O
. O

Do O
n't O
move O
his O
bones O
. O
'' O

So O
they O
left O
his O
bones O
and O
the O
bones O
of O
the O
man O
of O
God O
from O
Samaria O
. O

Josiah O
also O
destroyed O
all O
the O
temples O
at O
the O
high O
places O
in O
the O
cities O
of O
Samaria O
. O

The O
kings O
of O
Israel O
had O
built O
those O
temples O
, O
which O
had O
made O
the O
Lord O
very O
angry O
. O

Josiah O
destroyed O
them O
, O
just O
as O
he O
had O
destroyed O
the O
place O
of O
worship O
at O
Bethel O
. O

Josiah O
killed O
all O
the O
priests O
of O
the O
high O
places O
that O
were O
in O
Samaria O
. O

He O
killed O
the O
priests O
on O
those O
altars O
and O
burned O
men O
's O
bones O
on O
the O
altars O
so O
that O
they O
could O
never O
be O
used O
again O
. O

Then O
he O
went O
back O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

Then O
King O
Josiah O
gave O
a O
command O
to O
all O
the O
people O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Celebrate O
Passover O
for O
the O
Lord O
your O
God O
. O

Do O
this O
just O
as O
it O
is O
written O
in O
the O
Book O
of O
the O
Agreement O

'' O

The O
people O
had O
not O
celebrated O
a O
Passover O

this O
since O
the O
days O
when O
the O
judges O
ruled O
Israel O
. O

None O
of O
the O
kings O
of O
Israel O
or O
the O
kings O
of O
Judah O
ever O
had O
such O
a O
big O
celebration O
for O
Passover O
. O

They O
celebrated O
this O
Passover O
for O
the O
Lord O
in O
Jerusalem O
during O
Josiah O
's O
18th O
year O
as O
king O
. O

Josiah O
destroyed O
the O
mediums O
, O
wizards O
, O
the O
house O
gods O
, O
the O
idols O
, O
and O
all O
the O
horrible O
things O
people O
worshiped O
in O
Judah O
and O
Jerusalem O
. O

He O
did O
this O
to O
obey O
the O
law O
written O
in O
the O
book O
that O
Hilkiah O
the O
priest O
found O
in O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
. O

There O
had O
never O
been O
a O
king O
like O
Josiah O
before O
. O

Josiah O
turned O
to O
the O
Lord O
with O
all O
his O
heart O
, O
with O
all O
his O
soul O
, O
and O
with O
all O
his O
strength O
. O

No O
king O
had O
followed O
all O
the O
Law O
of O
Moses O
like O
Josiah O
. O

And O
there O
has O
never O
been O
another O
king O
like O
Josiah O
since O
that O
time O
. O

But O
the O
Lord O
did O
not O
stop O
being O
angry O
with O
the O
people O
of O
Judah O
. O

He O
was O
still O
angry O
with O
them O
for O
everything O
that O
Manasseh O
had O
done O
. O

The O
Lord O
said O
, O
`` O

I O

I O

All O

While O
Josiah O

Pharaoh O

the O

went O

Josiah O
went O
out O

Pharaoh O
saw O
Josiah O

Josiah O

carried O
him O
from O

They O
buried O
Josiah O

Then O
the O

took O
Josiah O

Jehoahaz O

anointed O
him O

They O
made O
Jehoahaz O

was O
wrong O
. O

He O
did O
all O
the O
same O
things O
that O
his O
ancestors O
had O
done O
. O

Pharaoh O
Neco O
put O
Jehoahaz O
in O
prison O
at O
Riblah O
in O
the O
land O
of O
Hamath O
. O

So O
Jehoahaz O
could O
not O
rule O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

Pharaoh O
Neco O
forced O
Judah O
to O
pay O
7500 O
pounds O
of O
silver O
and O
75 O
pounds O
of O
gold O
. O

Pharaoh O
Neco O
made O
Josiah O
's O
son O
Eliakim O
the O
new O
king O
. O

Eliakim O
took O
the O
place O
of O
Josiah O
his O
father O
. O

Pharaoh O
Neco O
changed O
Eliakim O
's O
name O
to O
Jehoiakim O
. O

And O
Pharaoh O
Neco O
took O
Jehoahaz O
away O
to O
Egypt O
where O
he O
died O
. O

Jehoiakim O
gave O
the O
silver O
and O
the O
gold O
to O
Pharaoh O
. O

But O
Jehoiakim O
made O
the O
common O
people O
pay O
taxes O
and O
used O
that O
money O
to O
give O
to O
Pharaoh O
Neco O
. O

So O
everyone O
paid O
their O
share O
of O
silver O
and O
gold O
, O
and O
King O
Jehoiakim O
gave O
the O
money O
to O
Pharaoh O
Neco O
. O

Jehoiakim O
was O
25 O
years O
old O
when O
he O
became O
king O
. O

He O
ruled O
eleven O
years O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

His O
mother O
's O
name O
was O
Zebidah O
daughter O
of O
Pedaiah O
from O
Rumah O
. O

Jehoiakim O
did O
what O
the O
Lord O
said O
was O
wrong O
. O

He O
did O
all O
the O
same O
things O
his O
ancestors O
had O
done O
. O

So O
King O
Nebuchadnezzar O
of O
Babylon O
and O
all O
his O
army O
came O
to O
fight O
against O
Jerusalem O
. O

This O
happened O
on O
the O
10th O
day O
of O
the O
tenth O
month O
of O
Zedekiah O
's O
ninth O
year O
as O
king O
. O

Nebuchadnezzar O
put O
his O
army O
around O
Jerusalem O
to O
stop O
people O
from O
going O
in O
and O
out O
of O
the O
city O
. O

Then O
he O
built O
a O
wall O
of O
dirt O
around O
the O
city O
. O

His O
army O
stayed O
around O
Jerusalem O
until O
Zedekiah O
's O
eleventh O
year O
as O
king O
of O
Judah O
. O

The O
famine O
was O
getting O
worse O
and O
worse O
in O
the O
city O
. O

By O
the O
9th O
day O
of O
the O
fourth O
month O
there O
was O
no O
more O
food O
for O
the O
common O
people O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Nebuchadnezzar O
's O
army O
finally O
broke O
through O
the O
city O
wall O
. O

That O
night O
King O
Zedekiah O
and O
all O
his O
soldiers O
ran O
away O
. O

They O
used O
the O
secret O
gate O
that O
went O
through O
the O
double O
walls O
. O

It O
was O
by O
the O
king O
's O
garden O
. O

The O
enemy O
soldiers O
were O
all O
around O
the O
city O
, O
but O
Zedekiah O
and O
his O
men O
escaped O
on O
the O
road O
to O
the O
desert O
. O

The O
Babylonian O
army O
chased O
King O
Zedekiah O
and O
caught O
him O
near O
Jericho O
. O

All O
of O
Zedekiah O
's O
soldiers O
left O
him O
and O
ran O
away O
. O

The O
Babylonians O
took O
King O
Zedekiah O
to O
the O
king O
of O
Babylon O
at O
Riblah O
. O

The O
Babylonians O
decided O
to O
punish O
Zedekiah O
. O

They O
killed O
Zedekiah O
's O
sons O
in O
front O
of O
him O
. O

Then O
they O
put O
out O
Zedekiah O
's O
eyes O
. O

They O
put O
chains O
on O
him O
and O
took O
him O
to O
Babylon O
. O

Nebuchadnezzar O
came O
to O
Jerusalem O
on O
the O
7th O
day O
of O
the O
fifth O
month O
of O
his O
nineteenth O
year O
as O
king O
of O
Babylon O
. O

The O
captain O
of O
Nebuchadnezzar O
's O
best O
soldiers O
was O
Nebuzaradan O
. O

Nebuzaradan O
burned O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
, O
the O
king O
's O
palace O
, O
and O
all O
the O
houses O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

He O
destroyed O
even O
the O
largest O
houses O
. O

Then O
the O
Babylonian O
army O
that O
was O
with O
Nebuzaradan O
pulled O
down O
the O
walls O
around O
Jerusalem O
. O

Nebuzaradan O
captured O
all O
the O
people O
who O
were O
still O
left O
in O
the O
city O
. O

He O
took O
all O
the O
people O
as O
prisoners O
, O
even O
those O
who O
had O
tried O
to O
surrender O
. O

He O
let O
only O
the O
poorest O
of O
the O
common O
people O
stay O
there O
. O

He O
let O
them O
stay O
so O
that O
they O
could O
take O
care O
of O
the O
grapes O
and O
other O
crops O
. O

The O
Babylonian O
soldiers O
broke O
into O
pieces O
all O
the O
bronze O
things O
in O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
. O

They O
broke O
the O
bronze O
columns O
, O
the O
bronze O
carts O
, O
and O
the O
large O
bronze O
tank O
. O

Then O
they O
took O
all O
of O
that O
bronze O
to O
Babylon O
. O

The O
Babylonians O
also O
took O
the O
pots O
, O
the O
shovels O
, O
the O
tools O
for O
trimming O
the O
lamps O
, O
the O
spoons O
, O
and O
all O
the O
bronze O
dishes O
that O
were O
used O
in O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
. O

Nebuzaradan O
took O
all O
the O
firepans O
and O
bowls O
. O

He O
took O
all O
the O
things O
made O
of O
gold O
for O
the O
gold O
. O

And O
he O
took O
everything O
made O
of O
silver O
for O
the O
silver O
. O

So O
Nebuzaradan O
took O
the O
large O
bronze O
tank O
and O
the O
2 O
bronze O
columns O
. O

-LRB- O
Each O
column O
was O
about O
31 O
feet O
tall O
. O

The O
capitals O
on O
the O
columns O
were O
over O
5 O
feet O
tall O
. O

They O
were O
made O
from O
bronze O
and O
had O
a O
design O
like O
a O
net O
and O
pomegranates O
. O

Both O
columns O
had O
the O
same O
kind O
of O
design O
. O
-RRB- O

He O
also O
took O
the O
carts O
that O
Solomon O
made O
for O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
. O

The O
bronze O
from O
these O
things O
was O
too O
heavy O
to O
be O
weighed O
. O

From O
the O
Temple O
Nebuzaradan O
took O
Seraiah O
the O
high O
priest O
, O
Zephaniah O
the O
second O
priest O
, O
and O
the O
three O
men O
who O
guarded O
the O
entrance O
. O

From O
the O
city O
Nebuzaradan O
took O
one O
official O
who O
was O
in O
charge O
of O
the O
army O
and O
five O
of O
the O
king O
's O
advisors O
who O
were O
still O
in O
the O
city O
. O

He O
took O
one O
secretary O
of O
the O
commander O
of O
the O
army O
who O
was O
in O
charge O
of O
counting O
the O
common O
people O
and O
choosing O
some O
of O
them O
to O
be O
soldiers O
and O
60 O
people O
who O
just O
happened O
to O
be O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Then O
Nebuzaradan O
took O
all O
these O
people O
to O
the O
king O
of O
Babylon O
at O
Riblah O
in O
the O
area O
of O
Hamath O
. O

The O
king O
of O
Babylon O
killed O
them O
there O
at O
Riblah O
. O

And O
the O
people O
of O
Judah O
were O
led O
away O
as O
prisoners O
from O
their O
land O
. O

King O
Nebuchadnezzar O
of O
Babylon O
left O
some O
people O
in O
the O
land O
of O
Judah O
. O

There O
was O
a O
man O
named O
Gedaliah O
son O
of O
Ahikam O
son O
of O
Shaphan O
. O

Nebuchadnezzar O
made O
Gedaliah O
governor O
over O
the O
people O
in O
Judah O
. O

The O
army O
captains O
were O
Ishmael O
son O
of O
Nethaniah O
, O
Johanan O
son O
of O
Kareah O
, O
Seraiah O
son O
of O
Tanhumeth O
from O
Netophah O
, O
and O
Jaazaniah O
son O
of O
the O
Maachathite O
. O

These O
army O
captains O
and O
their O
men O
heard O
that O
the O
king O
of O
Babylon O
had O
made O
Gedaliah O
governor O
, O
so O
they O
went O
to O
Mizpah O
to O
meet O
with O
him O
. O

Gedaliah O
made O
promises O
to O
these O
officers O
and O
their O
men O
. O

He O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
be O
afraid O
of O
the O
Babylonian O
officers O
. O

Stay O
here O
and O
serve O
the O
king O
of O
Babylon O
. O

Then O
everything O
will O
be O
all O
right O
with O
you O
. O
'' O

Ishmael O
son O
of O
Nethaniah O
son O
of O
Elishama O
was O
from O
the O
king O
's O
family O
. O

In O
the O
seventh O
month O
Ishmael O
and O
ten O
of O
his O
men O
attacked O
Gedaliah O
and O
killed O
all O
the O
men O
of O
Judah O
and O
Babylonians O
who O
were O
with O
Gedaliah O
at O
Mizpah O
. O

Then O
the O
army O
officers O
and O
all O
the O
people O
ran O
away O
to O
Egypt O
. O

Everyone O
, O
from O
the O
least O
important O
to O
the O
most O
important O
, O
ran O
away O
because O
they O
were O
afraid O
of O
the O
Babylonians O
. O

Later O
, O
Evil O
Merodach O
became O
the O
king O
of O
Babylon O
. O

He O
let O
King O
Jehoiachin O
of O
Judah O
out O
of O
prison O
. O

This O
happened O
in O
the O
37th O
year O
after O
Jehoiachin O
was O
captured O
. O

This O
was O
on O
the O
27th O
day O
of O
the O
twelfth O
month O
from O
the O
time O
that O
Evil O
Merodach O
began O
to O
rule O
. O

Evil O
Merodach O
was O
kind O
to O
Jehoiachin O
. O

He O
gave O
him O
a O
more O
important O
place O
to O
sit O
than O
the O
other O
kings O
who O
were O
with O
him O
in O
Babylon O
. O

Evil O
Merodach O
let O
Jehoiachin O
stop O
wearing O
prison O
clothes O
. O

And O
every O
day O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
his O
life O
he O
ate O
at O
the O
same O
table O
with O
the O
king O
. O

And O
each O
day O
, O
for O
as O
long O
as O
Jehoiachin O
lived O
, O
the O
king O
gave O
him O
enough O
money O
to O
pay O
for O
whatever O
he O
needed O
. O

Athaliah O
was O
Ahaziah O
's O
mother O
. O

She O
saw O
that O
her O
son O
was O
dead O
, O
so O
she O
got O
up O
and O
killed O
all O
the O
king O
's O
family O
. O

Jehosheba O
was O
King O
Joram O
's O
daughter O
and O
Ahaziah O
's O
sister O
. O

Joash O
was O
one O
of O
the O
king O
's O
sons O
. O

While O
the O
other O
children O
were O
being O
killed O
, O
Jehosheba O
took O
Joash O
and O
hid O
him O
. O

She O
put O
him O
and O
his O
nurse O
in O
her O
bedroom O
, O
so O
Jehosheba O
and O
the O
nurse O
hid O
Joash O
from O
Athaliah O
. O

That O
way O
Joash O
was O
not O
killed O
. O

Then O
Joash O
and O
Jehosheba O
hid O
in O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
. O

Joash O
hid O
there O
for O
six O
years O
. O

During O
that O
time O
Athaliah O
ruled O
over O
the O
land O
of O
Judah O
. O

In O
the O
seventh O
year O
Jehoiada O
the O
high O
priest O
sent O
for O
the O
captains O
of O
the O
Carites O
and O
guards O
. O

He O
brought O
them O
together O
in O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
and O
made O
an O
agreement O
with O
them O
. O

In O
the O
Temple O
he O
forced O
them O
to O
make O
a O
promise O
. O

Then O
he O
showed O
the O
king O
's O
son O
to O
them O
. O

Then O
Jehoiada O
gave O
them O
a O
command O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
This O
is O
what O
you O
must O
do O
. O

One-third O
of O
you O
, O
from O
those O
who O
go O
on O
duty O
on O
the O
Sabbath O
day O
, O
must O
stand O
guard O
at O
the O
royal O
palace O
. O

Another O
third O
will O
be O
at O
the O
Sur O
Gate O
, O
and O
the O
other O
third O
will O
be O
at O
the O
gate O
behind O
the O
guard O
. O

This O
way O
you O
will O
stand O
guard O
over O
the O
palace O
on O
all O
sides O
. O

Your O
two O
divisions O
who O
go O
off O
duty O
on O
the O
Sabbath O
day O
will O
stand O
guard O
at O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
and O
protect O
King O
Joash O
. O

You O
must O
stay O
with O
him O
wherever O
he O
goes O
. O

The O
whole O
group O
must O
surround O
the O
king O
. O

Each O
guard O
must O
have O
his O
weapon O
in O
his O
hand O
, O
and O
you O
must O
kill O
anyone O
who O
comes O
too O
close O
to O
you O
. O
'' O

The O
captains O
obeyed O
everything O
that O
Jehoiada O
the O
priest O
commanded O
. O

Each O
captain O
took O
his O
men O
, O
both O
those O
who O
were O
going O
on O
duty O
on O
the O
Sabbath O
day O
and O
those O
who O
were O
going O
off O
duty O
. O

All O
these O
men O
went O
to O
Jehoiada O
the O
priest O
, O
and O
he O
gave O
spears O
and O
shields O
to O
the O
captains O
. O

These O
were O
the O
spears O
and O
shields O
David O
put O
in O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
. O

These O
guards O
stood O
with O
their O
weapons O
in O
their O
hands O
from O
the O
right O
corner O
of O
the O
Temple O
to O
the O
left O
corner O
. O

They O
stood O
around O
the O
altar O
and O
the O
Temple O
and O
around O
the O
king O
when O
he O
went O
to O
the O
Temple O
. O

These O
men O
brought O
out O
Joash O
. O

They O
put O
the O
crown O
on O
him O
and O
gave O
him O
a O
copy O
of O
the O
agreement O
. O

Then O
they O
anointed O
him O
and O
made O
him O
the O
new O
king O
. O

They O
clapped O
their O
hands O
and O
shouted O
, O
`` O
Long O
live O
the O
king O
! O
'' O

Queen O
Athaliah O
heard O
the O
noise O
from O
the O
guards O
and O
the O
people O
, O
so O
she O
went O
to O
them O
at O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
. O

Athaliah O
saw O
the O
king O
by O
the O
column O
where O
new O
kings O
usually O
stood O
. O

She O
also O
saw O
the O
leaders O
and O
men O
playing O
the O
trumpets O
for O
him O
. O

She O
saw O
that O
all O
the O
people O
were O
very O
happy O
. O

She O
heard O
the O
trumpets O
, O
and O
she O
tore O
her O
clothes O
to O
show O
she O
was O
upset O
. O

Then O
Athaliah O
shouted O
, O
`` O
Treason O
! O

Treason O
! O
'' O

Jehoiada O
the O
priest O
gave O
a O
command O
to O
the O
captains O
who O
were O
in O
charge O
of O
the O
soldiers O
. O

Jehoiada O
told O
them O
, O
`` O
Take O
Athaliah O
outside O
of O
the O
Temple O
area O
. O

Kill O
any O
of O
her O
followers O
, O
but O
do O
n't O
kill O
them O
in O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
soldiers O
grabbed O
Athaliah O
and O
killed O
her O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
went O
through O
the O
horse O
's O
entrance O
to O
the O
palace O
. O

Then O
Jehoiada O
made O
the O
agreement O
between O
the O
Lord O
and O
the O
king O
and O
the O
people O
. O

This O
agreement O
showed O
that O
the O
king O
and O
the O
people O
belonged O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

Jehoiada O
also O
made O
the O
agreement O
between O
the O
king O
and O
the O
people O
. O

Then O
all O
the O
people O
went O
to O
the O
temple O
of O
Baal O
. O

They O
destroyed O
the O
statue O
of O
Baal O
and O
his O
altars O
. O

They O
broke O
them O
into O
many O
pieces O
. O

They O
also O
killed O
Baal O
's O
priest O
, O
Mattan O
, O
in O
front O
of O
the O
altars O
. O

So O
Jehoiada O
the O
priest O
put O
men O
in O
charge O
of O
maintaining O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
. O

The O
priest O
led O
all O
the O
people O
. O

They O
went O
from O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
to O
the O
king O
's O
palace O
. O

The O
king O
's O
special O
guards O
and O
the O
captains O
went O
with O
the O
king O
, O
and O
all O
the O
other O
people O
followed O
them O
. O

They O
went O
to O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
king O
's O
palace O
. O

Then O
King O
Joash O
sat O
on O
the O
throne O
. O

All O
the O
people O
were O
happy O
, O
and O
the O
city O
was O
peaceful O
. O

And O
Queen O
Athaliah O
was O
killed O
with O
a O
sword O
near O
the O
king O
's O
palace O
. O

Joash O
was O
seven O
years O
old O
when O
he O
became O
king O
. O

It O
was O
near O
the O
time O
for O
the O
Lord O
to O
take O
Elijah O
by O
a O
whirlwind O
up O
into O
heaven O
. O

Elijah O
and O
Elisha O
started O
to O
leave O
Gilgal O
. O

Elijah O
said O
to O
Elisha O
, O
`` O
Please O
stay O
here O
, O
because O
the O
Lord O
told O
me O
to O
go O
to O
Bethel O
. O
'' O

But O
Elisha O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
promise O
, O
as O
the O
Lord O
lives O
and O
as O
you O
live O
, O
I O
will O
not O
leave O
you O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
two O
men O
went O
down O
to O
Bethel O
. O

The O
group O
of O
prophets O
at O
Bethel O
came O
to O
Elisha O
and O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Do O
you O
know O
that O
the O
Lord O
will O
take O
your O
master O
away O
from O
you O
today O
? O
'' O

Elisha O
said O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
I O
know O
. O

Do O
n't O
talk O
about O
it O
. O
'' O

Elijah O
said O
to O
Elisha O
, O
`` O
Please O
stay O
here O
, O
because O
the O
Lord O
told O
me O
to O
go O
to O
Jericho O
. O
'' O

But O
Elisha O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
promise O
, O
as O
the O
Lord O
lives O
and O
as O
you O
live O
, O
I O
will O
not O
leave O
you O
! O
'' O

So O
the O
two O
men O
went O
to O
Jericho O
. O

The O
group O
of O
prophets O
at O
Jericho O
came O
to O
Elisha O
and O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Do O
you O
know O
that O
the O
Lord O
will O
take O
your O
master O
away O
from O
you O
today O
? O
'' O

Elisha O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
I O
know O
. O

Do O
n't O
talk O
about O
it O
. O
'' O

Elijah O
said O
to O
Elisha O
, O
`` O
Please O
stay O
here O
, O
because O
the O
Lord O
told O
me O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Jordan O
River O
. O
'' O

Elisha O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
promise O
, O
as O
the O
Lord O
lives O
and O
as O
you O
live O
, O
I O
will O
not O
leave O
you O
! O
'' O

So O
the O
two O
men O
went O
on O
. O

There O
were O
50 O
men O
from O
the O
group O
of O
prophets O
who O
followed O
them O
. O

Elijah O
and O
Elisha O
stopped O
at O
the O
Jordan O
River O
. O

The O
50 O
men O
stood O
far O
away O
from O
Elijah O
and O
Elisha O
. O

Elijah O
took O
off O
his O
coat O
, O
folded O
it O
, O
and O
hit O
the O
water O
with O
it O
. O

The O
water O
separated O
to O
the O
right O
and O
to O
the O
left O
. O

Then O
Elijah O
and O
Elisha O
crossed O
the O
river O
on O
dry O
ground O
. O

After O
they O
crossed O
the O
river O
, O
Elijah O
said O
to O
Elisha O
, O
`` O
What O
do O
you O
want O
me O
to O
do O
for O
you O
before O
God O
takes O
me O
away O
from O
you O
? O
'' O

Elisha O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
ask O
you O
for O
a O
double O
share O
of O
your O
spirit O
on O
me O
. O
'' O

Elijah O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
have O
asked O
a O
hard O
thing O
. O

If O
you O
see O
me O
when O
I O
am O
taken O
from O
you O
, O
it O
will O
happen O
. O

But O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
see O
me O
when O
I O
am O
taken O
from O
you O
, O
it O
will O
not O
happen O
. O
'' O

Elijah O
and O
Elisha O
were O
walking O
and O
talking O
together O
. O

Suddenly O
, O
some O
horses O
and O
a O
chariot O
came O
and O
separated O
Elijah O
from O
Elisha O
. O

The O
horses O
and O
the O
chariot O
were O
like O
fire O
. O

Then O
Elijah O
was O
carried O
up O
into O
heaven O
in O
a O
whirlwind O
. O

Elisha O
saw O
it O
, O
and O
shouted O
, O
`` O
My O
father O
! O

My O
father O
! O

The O
chariot O
of O
Israel O
and O
his O
horses O
! O
'' O

Elisha O
never O
saw O
Elijah O
again O
. O

Elisha O
grabbed O
his O
own O
clothes O
and O
tore O
them O
in O
two O
to O
show O
his O
sadness O
. O

Elijah O
's O
coat O
had O
fallen O
to O
the O
ground O
, O
so O
Elisha O
picked O
it O
up O
. O

He O
went O
back O
and O
stood O
at O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
Jordan O
River O
. O

He O
hit O
the O
water O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Where O
is O
the O
Lord O
, O
the O
God O
of O
Elijah O
? O
'' O

Just O
as O
Elisha O
hit O
the O
water O
, O
the O
water O
separated O
to O
the O
right O
and O
to O
the O
left O
! O

Then O
Elisha O
crossed O
the O
river O
. O

When O
the O
group O
of O
prophets O
at O
Jericho O
saw O
Elisha O
, O
they O
said O
, O
`` O
Elijah O
's O
spirit O
is O
now O
on O
Elisha O
! O
'' O

They O
came O
to O
meet O
Elisha O
. O

They O
bowed O
very O
low O
to O
the O
ground O
before O
him O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Look O
, O
we O
have O
50 O
good O
men O
. O

Please O
let O
them O
go O
and O
look O
for O
your O
master O
. O

Maybe O
the O
Lord O
's O
Spirit O
has O
taken O
Elijah O
up O
and O
dropped O
him O
on O
some O
mountain O
or O
in O
some O
valley O
. O
'' O

But O
Elisha O
answered O
, O
`` O
No O
, O
do O
n't O
send O
men O
to O
look O
for O
Elijah O
! O
'' O

The O
group O
of O
prophets O
begged O
Elisha O
until O
he O
was O
embarrassed O
. O

Then O
Elisha O
said O
, O
`` O
Send O
the O
men O
to O
look O
for O
Elijah O
. O
'' O

The O
group O
of O
prophets O
sent O
the O
50 O
men O
to O
look O
for O
Elijah O
. O

They O
looked O
three O
days O
, O
but O
they O
could O
not O
find O
him O
. O

So O
the O
men O
went O
to O
Jericho O
where O
Elisha O
was O
staying O
and O
told O
him O
. O

Elisha O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
I O
told O
you O
not O
to O
go O
. O
'' O

The O
men O
of O
the O
city O
said O
to O
Elisha O
, O
`` O
Sir O
, O
you O
can O
see O
this O
city O
is O
in O
a O
nice O
place O
, O
but O
the O
water O
is O
bad O
. O

That O
is O
why O
the O
land O
can O
not O
grow O
crops O
. O
'' O

Elisha O
said O
, O
`` O
Bring O
me O
a O
new O
bowl O
and O
put O
salt O
in O
it O
. O
'' O

They O
brought O
the O
bowl O
to O
Elisha O
. O

Then O
he O
went O
out O
to O
the O
place O
where O
the O
water O
began O
flowing O
from O
the O
ground O
. O

Elisha O
threw O
the O
salt O
into O
the O
water O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
Lord O
said O
, O
' O
I O
am O
making O
this O
water O
pure O
! O

From O
now O
on O
this O
water O
will O
not O
cause O
any O
more O
death O
or O
keep O
the O
land O
from O
growing O
crops O
. O
' O
'' O

The O
water O
became O
pure O
and O
is O
still O
good O
today O
. O

It O
happened O
just O
as O
Elisha O
had O
said O
. O

Elisha O
went O
from O
that O
city O
to O
Bethel O
. O

He O
was O
walking O
up O
the O
hill O
to O
the O
city O
, O
and O
some O
boys O
were O
coming O
down O
out O
of O
the O
city O
. O

They O
began O
making O
fun O
of O
him O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Go O
away O
, O
you O
bald-headed O
man O
! O

Go O
away O
, O
you O
bald-headed O
man O
! O
'' O

Elisha O
looked O
back O
and O
saw O
them O
. O

He O
asked O
the O
Lord O
to O
cause O
bad O
things O
to O
happen O
to O
them O
. O

Then O
two O
bears O
came O
out O
of O
the O
forest O
and O
attacked O
the O
boys O
. O

There O
were O
42 O
boys O
ripped O
apart O
by O
the O
bears O
. O

Elisha O
left O
Bethel O
and O
went O
to O
Mount O
Carmel O
and O
from O
there O
he O
went O
back O
to O
Samaria O
. O

David O
went O
a O
short O
way O
over O
the O
top O
of O
the O
Mount O
of O
Olives O
and O
met O
Ziba O
, O
the O
servant O
of O
Mephibosheth O
. O

Ziba O
had O
two O
donkeys O
with O
saddles O
on O
them O
. O

The O
donkeys O
also O
carried O
200 O
loaves O
of O
bread O
, O
100 O
bunches O
of O
raisins O
, O
100 O
summer O
fruits O
, O
and O
a O
wineskin O
full O
of O
wine O
. O

King O
David O
said O
to O
Ziba O
, O
`` O
What O
are O
these O
things O
for O
? O
'' O

Ziba O
answered O
, O
`` O
The O
donkeys O
are O
for O
the O
king O
's O
family O
to O
ride O
on O
. O

The O
bread O
and O
the O
summer O
fruit O
are O
for O
the O
servants O
to O
eat O
. O

And O
the O
wine O
is O
refreshment O
for O
whoever O
begins O
to O
feel O
weak O
in O
the O
desert O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
king O
asked O
, O
`` O
And O
where O
is O
Mephibosheth O
? O
'' O

Ziba O
answered O
the O
king O
, O
`` O
Mephibosheth O
is O
staying O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

He O
said O
, O
' O
Today O
the O
Israelites O
will O
give O
my O
father O
's O
kingdom O
back O
to O
me O
. O
' O
'' O

Then O
the O
king O
said O
to O
Ziba O
, O
`` O
All O
right O
, O
I O
now O
give O
you O
everything O
that O
belonged O
to O
Mephibosheth O
. O
'' O

Ziba O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
bow O
to O
you O
. O

I O
pray O
I O
will O
always O
be O
able O
to O
please O
you O
. O
'' O

As O
David O
came O
to O
Bahurim O
, O
a O
man O
from O
Saul O
's O
family O
, O
Shimei O
son O
of O
Gera O
, O
came O
out O
cursing O
David O
again O
and O
again O
. O

Shimei O
began O
throwing O
stones O
at O
David O
and O
his O
officers O
. O

Both O
the O
people O
and O
the O
soldiers O
gathered O
around O
David O
to O
protect O
him O
-- O
they O
were O
all O
around O
him O
. O

Shimei O
cursed O
David O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Get O
out O
, O
get O
out O
, O
you O
no-good O
murderer O
! O

The O
Lord O
is O
punishing O
you O
because O
you O
killed O
people O
in O
Saul O
's O
family O
. O

You O
stole O
Saul O
's O
place O
as O
king O
. O

But O
now O
the O
same O
bad O
things O
are O
happening O
to O
you O
. O

The O
Lord O
has O
given O
the O
kingdom O
to O
your O
son O
Absalom O
, O
because O
you O
are O
a O
murderer O
. O
'' O

Abishai O
son O
of O
Zeruiah O
said O
to O
the O
king O
, O
`` O
Why O
should O
this O
dying O
dog O
curse O
you O
, O
my O
lord O
the O
king O
? O

Let O
me O
go O
over O
and O
cut O
off O
Shimei O
's O
head O
. O
'' O

But O
the O
king O
answered O
, O
`` O
What O
can O
I O
do O
, O
sons O
of O
Zeruiah O
? O

Yes O
, O
Shimei O
is O
cursing O
me O
, O
but O
the O
Lord O
told O
him O
to O
curse O
me O
. O

And O
who O
can O
ask O
him O
why O
he O
did O
that O
? O
'' O

David O
also O
said O
to O
Abishai O
and O
all O
his O
servants O
, O
`` O
Look O
, O
my O
very O
own O
son O
is O
trying O
to O
kill O
me O
, O
so O
why O
should O
n't O
this O
man O
from O
the O
tribe O
of O
Benjamin O
want O
to O
do O
the O
same O
? O

Leave O
him O
alone O
. O

Let O
him O
continue O
to O
curse O
me O
. O

The O
Lord O
told O
him O
to O
do O
this O
. O

Maybe O
the O
Lord O
will O
see O
the O
wrong O
things O
that O
are O
happening O
to O
me O
and O
give O
me O
something O
good O
for O
every O
bad O
thing O
that O
Shimei O
says O
today O
. O
'' O

So O
David O
and O
his O
men O
went O
on O
their O
way O
down O
the O
road O
. O

Shimei O
kept O
following O
David O
. O

He O
walked O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
road O
by O
the O
side O
of O
the O
hill O
. O

He O
kept O
cursing O
David O
on O
his O
way O
. O

Shimei O
also O
threw O
stones O
and O
dirt O
at O
David O
. O

King O
David O
and O
all O
his O
people O
came O
to O
the O
Jordan O
River O
. O

They O
were O
tired O
, O
so O
they O
rested O
and O
refreshed O
themselves O
there O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
Absalom O
, O
Ahithophel O
, O
and O
all O
the O
Israelites O
came O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

David O
's O
friend O
, O
Hushai O
the O
Arkite O
, O
came O
to O
Absalom O
and O
told O
him O
, O
`` O
Long O
live O
the O
king O
! O

Long O
live O
the O
king O
! O
'' O

Absalom O
answered O
, O
`` O
Why O
are O
you O
not O
loyal O
to O
your O
friend O
David O
? O

Why O
did O
you O
not O
leave O
Jerusalem O
with O
your O
friend O
? O
'' O

Hushai O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
belong O
to O
the O
one O
that O
the O
Lord O
chooses O
. O

These O
people O
and O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
chose O
you O
. O

I O
will O
stay O
with O
you O
. O

In O
the O
past O
, O
I O
served O
your O
father O
. O

So O
now O
I O
will O
serve O
you O
, O
David O
's O
son O
. O
'' O

Absalom O
said O
to O
Ahithophel O
, O
`` O
Please O
tell O
us O
what O
we O
should O
do O
. O
'' O

Ahithophel O
said O
to O
Absalom O
, O
`` O
Your O
father O
left O
some O
of O
his O
slave O
women O
here O
to O
take O
care O
of O
the O
house O
. O

Go O
and O
have O
sexual O
relations O
with O
them O
. O

Then O
all O
the O
Israelites O
will O
hear O
how O
you O
humiliated O
your O
father O
, O
and O
they O
will O
be O
encouraged O
to O
give O
you O
more O
support O
. O
'' O

Then O
they O
put O
up O
a O
tent O
for O
Absalom O
up O
on O
the O
roof O
of O
the O
house O
. O

Absalom O
had O
sexual O
relations O
with O
his O
father O
's O
wives O
so O
that O
all O
the O
Israelites O
could O
see O
what O
happened O
. O

So O
in O
those O
days O
, O
Ahithophel O
's O
advice O
was O
very O
important O
. O

Both O
David O
and O
Absalom O
accepted O
his O
advice O
as O
though O
it O
were O
the O
word O
of O
God O
. O

Saul O
's O
son O
Ish O
Bosheth O
heard O
that O
Abner O
had O
died O
at O
Hebron O
. O

Ish O
Bosheth O
and O
all O
his O
people O
became O
very O
afraid O
. O

Two O
men O
went O
to O
see O
to O
Saul O
's O
son O
. O

These O
two O
men O
were O
captains O
in O
the O
army O
. O

They O
were O
Recab O
and O
Baanah O
, O
the O
sons O
of O
Rimmon O
from O
Beeroth O
. O

-LRB- O
They O
were O
Benjamites O
because O
the O
town O
Beeroth O
belonged O
to O
the O
tribe O
of O
Benjamin O
. O

But O
all O
the O
people O
in O
Beeroth O
ran O
away O
to O
Gittaim O
, O
and O
they O

Saul O
's O
son O
Jonathan O
had O
a O
son O
named O
Mephibosheth O
. O

He O
was O
five O
years O
old O
when O
the O
news O
came O
from O
Jezreel O
that O
Saul O
and O
Jonathan O
had O
been O
killed O
. O

The O
woman O
who O
cared O
for O
Mephibosheth O
picked O
him O
up O
and O
ran O
away O
. O

But O
while O
running O
away O
, O
she O
dropped O
the O
boy O
, O
and O
he O
became O
crippled O
in O
both O
feet O
. O

Recab O
and O
Baanah O
, O
sons O
of O
Rimmon O
from O
Beeroth O
, O
went O
to O
Ish O
Bosheth O
's O
house O
at O
noon O
. O

Ish O
Bosheth O
was O
resting O
because O
it O
was O
hot O
. O

Recab O
and O
Baanah O
came O
into O
the O
house O
as O
if O
they O
were O
going O
to O
get O
some O
wheat O
. O

Ish O
Bosheth O
was O
lying O
on O
his O
bed O
in O
his O
bedroom O
, O
and O
they O
stabbed O
and O
killed O
him O
. O

Then O
they O
cut O
off O
his O
head O
and O
took O
it O
with O
them O
. O

They O
traveled O
all O
night O
on O
the O
road O
through O
the O
Jordan O
Valley O
. O

When O
they O
arrived O
at O
Hebron O
, O
they O
gave O
Ish O
Bosheth O
's O
head O
to O
David O
. O

Recab O
and O
Baanah O
said O
to O
King O
David O
, O
`` O
Here O
is O
the O
head O
of O
your O
enemy O
, O
Ish O
Bosheth O
son O
of O
Saul O
. O

He O
tried O
to O
kill O
you O
, O
but O
the O
Lord O
has O
punished O
Saul O
and O
his O
family O
for O
you O
today O
. O
'' O

But O
David O
told O
Recab O
and O
his O
brother O
Baanah O
, O
`` O
As O
surely O
as O
the O
Lord O
lives O
, O
it O
is O
the O
Lord O
who O
has O
rescued O
me O
from O
all O
my O
troubles O
! O

Once O
before O
a O
man O
thought O
he O
would O
bring O
me O
good O
news O
. O

He O
told O
me O
, O
' O
Look O
! O

Saul O
is O
dead O
. O
' O

He O
thought O
I O
would O
reward O
him O
for O
bringing O
me O
the O
news O
. O

But O
I O
grabbed O
this O
man O
and O
killed O
him O
at O
Ziklag O
. O

I O
will O
kill O
you O
too O
and O
remove O
this O
evil O
from O
our O
land O
because O
you O
evil O
men O
killed O
a O
good O
man O
sleeping O
on O
his O
own O
bed O
, O
in O
his O
own O
house O
. O
'' O

So O
David O
commanded O
his O
young O
helpers O
to O
kill O
Recab O
and O
Baanah O
. O

The O
young O
men O
cut O
off O
the O
hands O
and O
feet O
of O
Recab O
and O
Baanah O
and O
hanged O
them O
by O
the O
pool O
of O
Hebron O
. O

Then O
they O
took O
the O
head O
of O
Ish O
Bosheth O
and O
buried O
it O
where O
Abner O
was O
buried O
at O
Hebron O
. O

There O
was O
war O
for O
a O
long O
time O
between O
Saul O
's O
family O
and O
David O
's O
family O
. O

David O
became O
stronger O
and O
stronger O
, O
but O
Saul O
's O
family O
became O
weaker O
and O
weaker O
. O

Several O
of O
David O
's O
sons O
were O
born O
at O
Hebron O
. O

The O
first O
son O
was O
Amnon O
. O

Amnon O
's O
mother O
was O
Ahinoam O
from O
Jezreel O
. O

The O
second O
son O
was O
Kileab O
. O

Kileab O
's O
mother O
was O
Abigail O
, O
who O
had O
been O
the O
wife O
of O
Nabal O
from O
Carmel O
. O

The O
third O
son O
was O
Absalom O
. O

His O
mother O
was O
Maacah O
daughter O
of O
King O
Talmai O
of O
Geshur O
. O

The O
fourth O
son O
was O
Adonijah O
. O

Adonijah O
's O
mother O
was O
Haggith O
. O

The O
fifth O
son O
was O
Shephatiah O
. O

Shephatiah O
's O
mother O
was O
Abital O
. O

The O
sixth O
son O
was O
Ithream O
. O

Ithream O
's O
mother O
was O
David O
's O
wife O
Eglah O
. O

These O
sons O
were O
all O
born O
at O
Hebron O
. O

As O
the O
families O
of O
Saul O
and O
David O
fought O
each O
other O
, O
Abner O
became O
more O
and O
more O
powerful O
in O
Saul O
's O
army O
. O

Saul O
had O
a O
slave O
woman O
named O
Rizpah O
daughter O
of O
Aiah O
. O

Ish O
Bosheth O
said O
to O
Abner O
, O
`` O
Why O
did O
you O
have O
sexual O
relations O
with O
my O
father O
's O
servant O
woman O
? O
'' O

This O
made O
Abner O
very O
angry O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
have O
been O
loyal O
to O
Saul O
and O
his O
family O
. O

I O
did O
not O
give O
you O
to O
David O
. O

I O
am O
not O
a O
traitor O
working O
for O
Judah O
. O

But O
now O
you O
are O
saying O
that O
I O
did O
this O
bad O
thing O
. O

The O
Lord O
said O
he O
would O
take O
the O
kingdom O
away O
from O
Saul O
's O
family O
and O
give O
it O
to O
David O
. O

I O
swear O
, O
I O
will O
make O
sure O
that O
happens O
. O

The O
Lord O
will O
make O
David O
king O
of O
Judah O
and O
Israel O
. O

He O
will O
rule O
from O
Dan O
to O
Beersheba O
. O
'' O

Ish O
Bosheth O
was O
too O
afraid O
of O
Abner O
to O
say O
anything O
in O
response O
. O

Abner O
sent O
messengers O
to O
David O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Who O
do O
you O
think O
should O
rule O
this O
country O
? O

Make O
an O
agreement O
with O
me O
, O
and O
I O
will O
help O
you O
become O
the O
ruler O
of O
all O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
. O
'' O

David O
answered O
, O
`` O
Good O
! O

I O
will O
make O
an O
agreement O
with O
you O
. O

But O
I O
ask O
you O
only O
one O
thing O
: O
I O
will O
not O
meet O
with O
you O
until O
you O
bring O
Saul O
's O
daughter O
Michal O
to O
me O
. O
'' O

David O
sent O
messengers O
to O
Saul O
's O
son O
Ish O
Bosheth O
. O

David O
said O
, O
`` O
Give O
me O
my O
wife O
Michal O
. O

She O
was O
promised O
to O
me O
. O

I O
killed O
100 O
Philistines O
to O
get O
her O
. O
'' O

Then O
Ish O
Bosheth O
told O
the O
men O
to O
go O
and O
take O
Michal O
from O
a O
man O
named O
Paltiel O
son O
of O
Laish O
. O

Michal O
's O
husband O
, O
Paltiel O
, O
followed O
them O
, O
crying O
all O
the O
way O
to O
Bahurim O
. O

Finally O
Abner O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Go O
back O
home O
. O
'' O

So O
Paltiel O
went O
back O
home O
. O

Abner O
sent O
this O
message O
to O
the O
leaders O
of O
Israel O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
have O
been O
wanting O
to O
make O
David O
your O
king O
. O

Now O
do O
it O
! O

The O
Lord O
was O
talking O
about O
David O
when O
he O
said O
, O
' O
I O
will O
save O
my O
people O
the O
Israelites O
from O
the O
Philistines O
and O
all O
their O
other O
enemies O
. O

I O
will O
do O
this O
through O
my O
servant O
David O
. O
' O
'' O

Abner O
said O
these O
things O
to O
David O
in O
Hebron O
, O
and O
he O
said O
these O
things O
to O
the O
people O
of O
the O
tribe O
of O
Benjamin O
. O

The O
things O
Abner O
said O
sounded O
good O
to O
the O
tribe O
of O
Benjamin O
and O
to O
all O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
. O

Then O
Abner O
came O
up O
to O
David O
at O
Hebron O
. O

Abner O
brought O
20 O
men O
with O
him O
. O

David O
gave O
a O
party O
for O
Abner O
and O
for O
all O
the O
men O
who O
came O
with O
him O
. O

Abner O
said O
to O
David O
, O
`` O
My O
lord O
and O
king O
, O
let O
me O
go O
bring O
all O
the O
Israelites O
to O
you O
. O

Then O
they O
will O
make O
an O
agreement O
with O
you O
, O
and O
you O
will O
rule O
over O
all O
Israel O
, O
as O
you O
wanted O
. O
'' O

So O
David O
let O
Abner O
leave O
in O
peace O
. O

Joab O
and O
David O
's O
officers O
came O
back O
from O
battle O
. O

They O
had O
many O
valuable O
things O
that O
they O
had O
taken O
from O
the O
enemy O
. O

David O
had O
just O
let O
Abner O
leave O
in O
peace O
. O

So O
Abner O
was O
not O
there O
in O
Hebron O
with O
David O
. O

Joab O
and O
all O
his O
army O
arrived O
at O
Hebron O
. O

The O
army O
said O
to O
Joab O
, O
`` O
Abner O
son O
of O
Ner O
came O
to O
King O
David O
, O
and O
David O
let O
Abner O
leave O
in O
peace O
. O
'' O

Joab O
came O
to O
the O
king O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
What O
have O
you O
done O
? O

Abner O
came O
to O
you O
, O
but O
you O
sent O
him O
away O
without O
hurting O
him O
! O

Why O
? O

You O
know O
Abner O
son O
of O
Ner O
. O

He O
came O
to O
trick O
you O
. O

He O
came O
to O
learn O
all O
about O
what O
you O
are O
doing O
. O
'' O

Joab O
left O
David O
and O
sent O
messengers O
to O
Abner O
at O
the O
well O
of O
Sirah O
. O

The O
messengers O
brought O
Abner O
back O
, O
but O
David O
did O
not O
know O
this O
. O

When O
Abner O
arrived O
at O
Hebron O
, O
Joab O
met O
him O
in O
the O
gateway O
, O
pulled O
him O
aside O
to O
talk O
in O
private O
, O
and O
then O
stabbed O
him O
in O
the O
stomach O
. O

So O
he O
got O
his O
revenge O
against O
Abner O
. O

Joab O
killed O
Abner O
because O
Abner O
had O
killed O
Joab O
's O
brother O
Asahel O
. O

Later O
David O
heard O
the O
news O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
My O
kingdom O
and O
I O
are O
innocent O
of O
the O
death O
of O
Abner O
son O
of O
Ner O
. O

The O
Lord O
knows O
this O
. O

Joab O
and O
his O
family O
are O
responsible O
for O
this O
, O
and O
they O
will O
be O
cursed O
. O

Many O
troubles O
will O
come O
to O
his O
family O
. O

His O
people O
will O
be O
sick O
with O
leprosy O
, O
crippled O
, O
killed O
in O
war O
, O
and O
not O
have O
enough O
food O
to O
eat O
! O
'' O

Joab O
and O
his O
brother O
Abishai O
killed O
Abner O
because O
Abner O
had O
killed O
their O
brother O
Asahel O
in O
the O
battle O
at O
Gibeon O
. O

David O
said O
to O
Joab O
and O
to O
all O
the O
people O
with O
Joab O
, O
`` O
Tear O
your O
clothes O
and O
put O
on O
sackcloth O
. O

Cry O
for O
Abner O
. O
'' O

They O
buried O
Abner O
in O
Hebron O
. O

David O
went O
to O
the O
funeral O
. O

King O
David O
and O
all O
the O
people O
cried O
at O
Abner O
's O
grave O
. O

King O
David O
sang O
this O
sad O
song O
at O
Abner O
's O
funeral O
: O
`` O
Did O
Abner O
die O
like O
some O
foolish O
criminal O
? O

Abner O
, O
your O
hands O
were O
not O
tied O
. O

Your O
feet O
were O
not O
put O
in O
chains O
. O

No O
, O
Abner O
, O
evil O
men O
killed O
you O
! O
'' O

Then O
all O
the O
people O
cried O
again O
for O
Abner O
. O

All O
day O
long O
people O
came O
to O
encourage O
David O
to O
eat O
food O
. O

But O
David O
had O
made O
a O
special O
promise O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
May O
God O
punish O
me O
and O
give O
me O
many O
troubles O
if O
I O
eat O
bread O
or O
any O
other O
food O
before O
the O
sun O
goes O
down O
. O
'' O

All O
the O
people O
saw O
what O
happened O
, O
and O
they O
were O
pleased O
with O
what O
King O
David O
had O
done O
. O

All O
the O
people O
of O
Judah O
and O
Israel O
understood O
that O
King O
David O
had O
not O
killed O
Abner O
son O
of O
Ner O
. O

King O
David O
said O
to O
his O
officers O
, O
`` O
You O
know O
that O
a O
very O
important O
leader O
died O
today O
in O
Israel O
. O

And O
it O
was O
on O
the O
very O
same O
day O
that O
I O
was O
anointed O
to O
be O
the O
king O
. O

These O
sons O
of O
Zeruiah O
have O
caused O
me O
a O
lot O
of O
trouble O
. O

May O
the O
Lord O
give O
them O
the O
punishment O
they O
deserve O
. O
'' O

The O
Lord O
was O
angry O
with O
Israel O
again O
. O

He O
caused O
David O
to O
turn O
against O
the O
Israelites O
. O

He O
told O
David O
, O
`` O
Go O
count O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
and O
Judah O
. O
'' O

King O
David O
said O
to O
Joab O
, O
the O
captain O
of O
the O
army O
, O
`` O
Go O
through O
all O
the O
tribes O
of O
Israel O
from O
Dan O
to O
Beersheba O
, O
and O
count O
the O
people O
. O

Then O
I O
will O
know O
how O
many O
people O
there O
are O
. O
'' O

But O
Joab O
said O
to O
the O
king O
, O
`` O
May O
the O
Lord O
your O
God O
give O
you O
100 O
times O
as O
many O
people O
, O
no O
matter O
how O
many O
there O
are O
! O

And O
may O
your O
eyes O
see O
this O
thing O
happen O
. O

But O
why O
do O
you O
want O
to O
do O
this O
? O
'' O

King O
David O
strongly O
commanded O
Joab O
and O
the O
other O
captains O
of O
the O
army O
to O
count O
the O
people O
. O

So O
they O
went O
out O
from O
the O
king O
to O
count O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
. O

After O
they O
crossed O
over O
the O
Jordan O
River O
, O
they O
made O
their O
camp O
in O
Aroer O
on O
the O
right O
side O
of O
the O
city O
. O

-LRB- O
The O
city O
is O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
valley O
of O
Gad O
, O
on O
the O
way O
to O
Jazer O
. O
-RRB- O

Then O
they O
went O
east O
to O
Gilead O
, O
all O
the O
way O
to O
Tahtim O
Hodshi O
. O

Then O
they O
went O
north O
to O
Dan O
Jaan O
and O
around O
to O
Sidon O
. O

They O
went O
to O
the O
fort O
of O
Tyre O
. O

They O
went O
to O
all O
the O
cities O
of O
the O
Hivites O
and O
of O
the O
Canaanites O
. O

Then O
they O
went O
south O
to O
Beersheba O
in O
the O
southern O
part O
of O
Judah O
. O

It O
took O
them O
nine O
months O
and O
20 O
days O
for O
them O
to O
go O
through O
the O
country O
. O

After O
nine O
months O
and O
20 O
days O
they O
came O
back O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

Joab O
gave O
the O
list O
of O
the O
people O
to O
the O
king O
. O

There O
were O
800,000 O
men O
in O
Israel O
who O
could O
use O
the O
sword O
. O

And O
there O
were O
500,000 O
men O
in O
Judah O
. O

David O
felt O
ashamed O
after O
he O
had O
counted O
the O
people O
and O
said O
to O
the O
Lord O
, O
`` O
I O
have O
sinned O
greatly O
in O
what O
I O
did O
! O

Lord O
, O
I O
beg O
you O
, O
forgive O
me O
for O
my O
sin O
. O

I O
have O
been O
very O
foolish O
. O
'' O

When O
David O
got O
up O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
the O
Lord O
's O
word O
came O
to O
Gad O
, O
David O
's O
seer O
. O

The O
Lord O
told O
Gad O
, O
`` O
Go O
and O
tell O
David O
, O
' O
This O
is O
what O
the O
Lord O
says O
: O
I O
offer O
you O
three O
things O
. O

Choose O
the O
one O
that O
I O
will O
do O
to O
you O
. O
' O
'' O

So O
Gad O
went O
to O
David O
and O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Choose O
one O
of O
these O
three O
things O
: O
seven O
years O
of O
famine O
for O
you O
and O
your O
country O
, O
or O
your O
enemies O
will O
chase O
you O
for O
three O
months O
, O
or O
three O
days O
of O
disease O
in O
your O
country O
. O

Think O
about O
it O
, O
and O
choose O
one O
of O
these O
things O
. O

Then O
I O
will O
tell O
the O
Lord O
who O
sent O
me O
about O
your O
choice O
. O
'' O

David O
said O
to O
Gad O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
really O
in O
trouble O
, O
but O
the O
Lord O
is O
very O
merciful O
. O

So O
I O
choose O
to O
let O
the O
Lord O
punish O
us O
. O

Do O
n't O
let O
my O
punishment O
come O
from O
people O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
Lord O
sent O
a O
disease O
against O
Israel O
. O

It O
began O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
continued O
until O
the O
chosen O
time O
to O
stop O
. O

From O
Dan O
to O
Beersheba O
70,000 O
people O
died O
. O

The O
angel O
raised O
his O
arm O
over O
Jerusalem O
and O
was O
ready O
to O
destroy O
it O
, O
but O
the O
Lord O
felt O
very O
sorry O
about O
the O
bad O
things O
that O
had O
happened O
. O

He O
said O
to O
the O
angel O
who O
destroyed O
the O
people O
, O
`` O
That O
's O
enough O
! O

Put O
down O
your O
arm O
. O
'' O

The O
Lord O
's O
angel O
was O
by O
the O
threshing O
floor O
of O
Araunah O
the O
Jebusite O
. O

When O
he O
saw O
the O
angel O
who O
killed O
the O
people O
, O
David O
spoke O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

David O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
sinned O
! O

I O
did O
wrong O
! O

And O
these O
people O
only O
did O
what O
I O
told O
them O
-- O
they O
only O
followed O
me O
like O
sheep O
. O

They O
did O
nothing O
wrong O
. O

Please O
let O
your O
punishment O
be O
against O
me O
and O
my O
father O
's O
family O
. O
'' O

That O
day O
Gad O
came O
to O
David O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Go O
and O
build O
an O
altar O
to O
the O
Lord O
on O
the O
threshing O
floor O
of O
Araunah O
the O
Jebusite O
. O
'' O

So O
David O
did O
what O
Gad O
told O
him O
to O
. O

David O
did O
what O
the O
Lord O
wanted O
and O
went O
to O
see O
Araunah O
. O

Araunah O
looked O
and O
saw O
King O
David O
and O
his O
officers O
coming O
to O
him O
. O

Araunah O
went O
out O
and O
bowed O
his O
face O
to O
the O
ground O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Why O
has O
my O
lord O
and O
king O
come O
to O
me O
? O
'' O

David O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
came O
to O
buy O
the O
threshing O
floor O
from O
you O
. O

Then O
I O
can O
build O
an O
altar O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

Then O
the O
disease O
will O
stop O
. O
'' O

Araunah O
said O
to O
David O
, O
`` O
My O
lord O
and O
king O
, O
you O
can O
take O
anything O
you O
want O
for O
a O
sacrifice O
. O

Here O
are O
some O
oxen O
for O
the O
burnt O
offering O
, O
and O
the O
threshing O
boards O
and O
the O
yokes O
for O
the O
wood O
. O

O O
King O
, O
I O
give O
everything O
to O
you O
! O
'' O

Araunah O
also O
said O
to O
the O
king O
, O
`` O
May O
the O
Lord O
your O
God O
be O
pleased O
with O
you O
. O
'' O

But O
the O
king O
said O
to O
Araunah O
, O
`` O
No O
! O

I O
tell O
you O
the O
truth O
, O
I O
will O
pay O
you O
for O
these O
things O
. O

I O
will O
not O
offer O
burnt O
offerings O
to O
the O
Lord O
my O
God O
that O
cost O
me O
nothing O
. O
'' O

So O
David O
bought O
the O
threshing O
floor O
and O
the O
oxen O
for O
50 O
shekels O
of O
silver O
. O

Then O
David O
built O
an O
altar O
to O
the O
Lord O
there O
and O
offered O
burnt O
offerings O
and O
peace O
offerings O
. O

The O
Lord O
answered O
his O
prayer O
for O
the O
country O
. O

He O
stopped O
the O
disease O
in O
Israel O
. O

These O
are O
the O
last O
words O
of O
David O
: O
`` O
This O
message O
is O
from O
David O
son O
of O
Jesse O
. O

This O
message O
is O
from O
the O
man O
God O
made O
great O
. O

He O
is O
the O
king O
chosen O
by O
the O
God O
of O
Jacob O
, O
the O
sweet O
singer O
of O
Israel O
. O

The O
Lord O
's O
Spirit O
spoke O
through O
me O
. O

His O
word O
was O
on O
my O
tongue O
. O

The O
God O
of O
Israel O
spoke O
. O

The O
Rock O
of O
Israel O
said O
to O
me O
, O
' O
Whoever O
rules O
people O
fairly O
, O
who O
rules O
with O
respect O
for O
God O
, O
is O
like O
the O
morning O
light O
at O
dawn O
, O
like O
a O
morning O
without O
clouds O
. O

He O
is O
like O
sunshine O
after O
a O
rain O
that O
makes O
tender O
grass O
grow O
from O
the O
ground O
. O
' O

`` O
God O
made O
my O
family O
strong O
and O
secure O
. O

He O
made O
an O
agreement O
with O
me O
forever O
. O

God O
made O
sure O
this O
agreement O
was O
good O
and O
secure O
in O
every O
way O
. O

So O
surely O
he O
will O
give O
me O
every O
victory O
. O

He O
will O
give O
me O
everything O
I O
want O
! O

`` O
But O
evil O
people O
are O
like O
thorns O
. O

People O
do O
n't O
hold O
thorns O
. O

They O
throw O
them O
away O
. O

If O
someone O
touches O
them O
, O
it O
hurts O
like O
a O
spear O
made O
of O
wood O
and O
iron O
. O

Yes O
, O
evil O
people O
are O
like O
thorns O
. O

They O
will O
be O
thrown O
into O
the O
fire O
, O
and O
they O
will O
be O
completely O
burned O
. O
'' O

These O
are O
the O
names O
of O
David O
's O
special O
soldiers O
: O
Josheb O
Basshebeth O
the O
Tahkemonite O
was O
captain O
of O
the O
king O
's O
special O
forces O
. O

He O
used O
his O
spear O
to O
kill O
800 O
men O
at O
one O
time O
. O

Next O
, O
there O
was O
Eleazar O
son O
of O
Dodai O
who O
was O
there O
with O
David O
when O
he O
challenged O
the O
Philistines O
who O
had O
gathered O
for O
battle O
. O

The O
Israelites O
ran O
away O
, O
but O
Eleazar O
stood O
and O
fought O
the O
Philistines O
until O
his O
hand O
became O
so O
tired O
that O
it O
cramped O
around O
his O
sword O
handle O
. O

The O
Lord O
won O
a O
great O
victory O
that O
day O
. O

The O
people O
of O
Israel O
came O
back O
, O
but O
only O
to O
take O
things O
from O
the O
dead O
. O

Next O
there O
was O
Shammah O
son O
of O
Agee O
from O
Harar O
. O

The O
Philistines O
came O
together O
to O
fight O
. O

They O
fought O
in O
a O
field O
of O
lentils O
. O

The O
people O
ran O
away O
from O
the O
Philistines O
. O

But O
Shammah O
stood O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
field O
and O
defended O
it O
. O

He O
defeated O
the O
Philistines O
. O

The O
Lord O
gave O
Israel O
a O
great O
victory O
that O
day O
. O

Once O
during O
harvest O
time O
David O
was O
at O
the O
cave O
of O
Adullam O
, O
and O
three O
of O
the O
Thirty O
Heroes O
went O
down O
to O
meet O
him O
there O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
the O
Philistine O
army O
was O
camped O
in O
the O
Valley O
of O
Rephaim O
. O

Another O
time O
David O
was O
in O
the O
fortress O
, O
and O
a O
group O
of O
Philistines O
soldiers O
was O
stationed O
in O
Bethlehem O
. O

David O
was O
thirsty O
for O
some O
water O
from O
his O
hometown O
, O
so O
he O
said O
, O
`` O
Oh O
, O
if O
only O
I O
could O
have O
some O
water O
from O
that O
well O
by O
the O
gate O
in O
Bethlehem O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
Three O
Heroes O
fought O
their O
way O
through O
the O
Philistine O
army O
and O
got O
some O
water O
from O
the O
well O
near O
the O
city O
gate O
in O
Bethlehem O
. O

They O
took O
it O
to O
David O
, O
but O
he O
refused O
to O
drink O
it O
. O

He O
poured O
it O
on O
the O
ground O
as O
an O
offering O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

David O
said O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
I O
can O
not O
drink O
this O
water O
. O

It O
would O
be O
like O
drinking O
the O
blood O
of O
the O
men O
who O
risked O
their O
lives O
for O
me O
. O
'' O

This O
is O
why O
David O
refused O
to O
drink O
the O
water O
. O

The O
Three O
Heroes O
did O
many O
brave O
things O
like O
that O
. O

Abishai O
was O
the O
brother O
of O
Joab O
son O
of O
Zeruiah O
. O

Abishai O
was O
the O
leader O
of O
the O
Three O
Heroes O
. O

He O
used O
his O
spear O
against O
300 O
enemies O
and O
killed O
them O
. O

He O
became O
as O
famous O
as O
the O
Three O
. O

Abishai O
was O
as O
famous O
as O
the O
Three O
Heroes O
. O

He O
became O
their O
leader O
, O
even O
though O
he O
was O
not O
one O
of O
them O
. O

Then O
there O
was O
Benaiah O
son O
of O
Jehoiada O
, O
from O
Kabzeel O
. O

He O
was O
the O
son O
of O
a O
powerful O
man O
. O

Benaiah O
did O
many O
brave O
things O
. O

He O
killed O
two O
of O
the O
best O
soldiers O
in O
Moab O
. O

One O
day O
when O
it O
was O
snowing O
, O
Benaiah O
went O
down O
into O
a O
hole O
in O
the O
ground O
and O
killed O
a O
lion O
. O

Benaiah O
also O
killed O
a O
big O
Egyptian O
soldier O
. O

The O
Egyptian O
had O
a O
spear O
in O
his O
hand O
, O
and O
Benaiah O
only O
had O
a O
club O
. O

He O
grabbed O
the O
spear O
in O
the O
Egyptian O
's O
hands O
and O
took O
it O
away O
from O
him O
. O

Then O
Benaiah O
killed O
the O
Egyptian O
with O
his O
own O
spear O
. O

Benaiah O
son O
of O
Jehoiada O
did O
many O
more O
brave O
things O
like O
that O
. O

He O
was O
as O
famous O
as O
the O
Three O
Heroes O
. O

Benaiah O
was O
even O
more O
famous O
than O
the O
Thirty O
Heroes O
, O
but O
he O
did O
not O
become O
a O
member O
of O
the O
Three O
Heroes O
. O

David O
made O
Benaiah O
the O
leader O
of O
his O
bodyguards O
. O

There O
were O
37 O
in O
all O
. O

All O
the O
tribes O
of O
Israel O
came O
to O
David O
at O
Hebron O
. O

They O
said O
to O
David O
, O
`` O
Look O
, O
we O
are O
one O
family O
! O

Even O
when O
Saul O
was O
our O
king O
, O
you O
were O
the O
one O
who O
led O
us O
into O
battle O
. O

And O
you O
were O
the O
one O
who O
brought O
Israel O
back O
home O
from O
war O
. O

The O
Lord O
himself O
said O
to O
you O
, O
' O
You O
will O
be O
the O
shepherd O
of O
my O
people O
, O
the O
Israelites O
. O

You O
will O
be O
the O
ruler O
over O
Israel O
. O
' O
'' O

So O
all O
the O
leaders O
of O
Israel O
came O
to O
meet O
with O
King O
David O
at O
Hebron O
. O

He O
made O
an O
agreement O
with O
them O
in O
Hebron O
in O
front O
of O
the O
Lord O
, O
and O
they O
anointed O
David O
to O
be O
the O
king O
of O
Israel O
. O

David O
was O
30 O
years O
old O
when O
he O
began O
to O
rule O
. O

He O
was O
king O
for O
40 O
years O
. O

In O
Hebron O
he O
ruled O
over O
Judah O
for O
7 O
years O
and O
6 O
months O
, O
and O
in O
Jerusalem O
he O
ruled O
over O
all O
Israel O
and O
Judah O
for O
33 O
years O
. O

The O
king O
and O
his O
men O
went O
to O
fight O
against O
the O
Jebusites O
living O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

The O
Jebusites O
said O
to O
David O
, O
`` O
You O
can O
not O
come O
into O
our O
city O
. O

Even O
our O
blind O
and O
crippled O
people O
can O
stop O
you O
. O
'' O

-LRB- O
They O
said O
this O
because O
they O
thought O
that O
David O
would O
not O
be O
able O
to O
enter O
into O
their O
city O
. O

But O
David O
did O
take O
the O
fort O
of O
Zion O
. O

This O
fort O
became O
the O
City O
of O
David O
. O
-RRB- O

That O
day O
David O
said O
to O
his O
men O
, O
`` O
Whenever O
you O
strike O
at O
the O
Jebusites O
, O
aim O
for O
the O
throat O
and O
kill O
them O
. O
'' O

David O
said O
this O
because O
he O
hates O
to O
have O
people O
left O
who O
are O
crippled O
and O
blind O
. O

That O
is O
why O
people O
now O
say O
, O
`` O
The O
lame O
and O
blind O
are O
not O
allowed O
in O
the O
temple O
. O
'' O

David O
lived O
in O
the O
fort O
and O
called O
it O
`` O
The O
City O
of O
David O
. O
'' O

David O
built O
up O
the O
city O
from O
the O
Millo O
inward O
. O

He O
became O
stronger O
and O
stronger O
because O
the O
Lord O
All-Powerful O
was O
with O
him O
. O

King O
Hiram O
of O
Tyre O
sent O
messengers O
to O
David O
. O

He O
also O
sent O
cedar O
trees O
, O
carpenters O
, O
and O
stonemasons O
. O

They O
built O
a O
house O
for O
David O
. O

Then O
David O
knew O
that O
the O
Lord O
had O
really O
made O
him O
king O
of O
Israel O
and O
had O
made O
him O
ruler O
over O
his O
kingdom O
for O
the O
good O
of O
his O
people O
, O
Israel O
. O

David O
moved O
from O
Hebron O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

In O
Jerusalem O
, O
he O
got O
more O
slave O
women O
and O
wives O
. O

So O
David O
had O
more O
children O
who O
were O
born O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

David O
's O
sons O
who O
were O
born O
in O
Jerusalem O
are O
Shammua O
, O
Shobab O
, O
Nathan O
, O
Solomon O
, O
Ibhar O
, O
Elishua O
, O
Nepheg O
, O
Japhia O
, O
Elishama O
, O
Eliada O
, O
and O
Eliphelet O
. O

When O
the O
Philistines O
heard O
that O
the O
Israelites O
had O
anointed O
David O
to O
be O
the O
king O
of O
Israel O
, O
all O
the O
Philistines O
went O
up O
to O
kill O
him O
. O

David O
heard O
about O
this O
and O
went O
down O
into O
the O
fort O
at O
Jerusalem O
. O

The O
Philistines O
came O
and O
camped O
in O
Rephaim O
Valley O
. O

David O
asked O
the O
Lord O
, O
saying O
, O
`` O
Should O
I O
go O
up O
to O
fight O
against O
the O
Philistines O
? O

Will O
you O
help O
me O
defeat O
them O
? O
'' O

The O
Lord O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
I O
certainly O
will O
help O
you O
defeat O
the O
Philistines O
. O
'' O

Then O
David O
went O
to O
Baal O
Perazim O
and O
defeated O
the O
Philistines O
in O
that O
place O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
Lord O
broke O
through O
my O
enemies O
like O
water O
breaking O
through O
a O
dam O
. O
'' O

That O
is O
why O
David O
named O
that O
place O
`` O
Baal O
Perazim O
. O
'' O

The O
Philistines O
left O
the O
statues O
of O
their O
gods O
behind O
at O
Baal O
Perazim O
. O

David O
and O
his O
men O
took O
them O
away O
. O

Again O
the O
Philistines O
came O
up O
and O
camped O
in O
Rephaim O
Valley O
. O

David O
prayed O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

This O
time O
the O
Lord O
told O
him O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
go O
up O
the O
valley O
. O

Go O
around O
them O
to O
the O
other O
side O
of O
their O
army O
. O

Attack O
them O
from O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
balsam O
trees O
. O

When O
you O
hear O
the O
sound O
of O
marching O
in O
the O
tops O
of O
the O
balsam O
trees O
, O
you O
must O
act O
quickly O
because O
that O
is O
the O
sign O
that O
the O
Lord O
has O
gone O
out O
in O
front O
of O
you O
to O
defeat O
the O
Philistines O
. O
'' O

David O
did O
what O
the O
Lord O
commanded O
him O
to O
do O
, O
and O
he O
defeated O
the O
Philistines O
. O

He O
chased O
them O
from O
Geba O
to O
Gezer O
, O
killing O
them O
all O
along O
the O
way O
. O

David O
sang O
this O
song O
to O
the O
Lord O
when O
the O
Lord O
saved O
him O
from O
Saul O
and O
all O
his O
other O
enemies O
. O

The O
Lord O
is O
my O
Rock O
, O
my O
fortress O
, O
my O
place O
of O
safety O
. O

He O
is O
my O
God O
, O
the O
Rock O
I O
run O
to O
for O
protection O
. O

He O
is O
my O
shield O
; O
by O
his O
power O
I O
am O
saved O
. O

He O
is O
my O
hiding O
place O
, O
my O
place O
of O
safety O
, O
high O
in O
the O
hills O
. O

He O
is O
my O
savior O
, O
the O
one O
who O
rescues O
me O
from O
the O
cruel O
enemy O
. O

I O
called O
to O
the O
Lord O
for O
help O
, O
and O
he O
saved O
me O
from O
my O
enemies O
. O

He O
is O
worth O
of O
my O
praise O
! O

Waves O
of O
death O
were O
crashing O
around O
me O
. O

A O
deadly O
flood O
was O
carrying O
me O
away O
. O

The O
ropes O
of O
the O
grave O
wrapped O
around O
me O
. O

Death O
set O
its O
trap O
right O
there O
in O
front O
of O
me O
. O

In O
my O
trouble O
I O
called O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
cried O
out O
to O
my O
God O
for O
help O
. O

There O
in O
his O
temple O
he O
heard O
my O
voice O
. O

He O
heard O
my O
cry O
for O
help O
. O

The O
earth O
shook O
and O
shivered O
. O

The O
foundations O
of O
heaven O
trembled O
. O

They O
shook O
because O
he O
was O
angry O
! O

Smoke O
came O
from O
his O
nose O
. O

Burning O
flames O
came O
from O
his O
mouth O
. O

Red-hot O
coals O
fell O
from O
him O
. O

He O
tore O
open O
the O
sky O
and O
came O
down O
. O

He O
stood O
on O
a O
thick O
, O
dark O
cloud O
. O

He O
flew O
across O
the O
sky O
, O
riding O
on O
a O
Cherub O
angel O
, O
gliding O
on O
the O
wings O
of O
the O
wind O
. O

He O
wrapped O
himself O
in O
darkness O
that O
covered O
him O
like O
a O
tent O
. O

He O
was O
hidden O
by O
dark O
clouds O
filled O
with O
water O
. O

Out O
of O
the O
brightness O
before O
him O
, O
flashes O
of O
lightning O
came O
down O
. O

The O
Lord O
thundered O
from O
the O
sky O
. O

God O
Most O
High O
let O
his O
voice O
be O
heard O
. O

He O
scattered O
the O
enemy O
with O
his O
arrows O
-- O
the O
lightning O
bolts O
that O
threw O
them O
into O
confusion O
. O

The O
Lord O
shouted O
his O
command O
, O
and O
a O
powerful O
wind O
began O
to O
blow O
. O

Then O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
sea O
could O
be O
seen O
, O
and O
the O
earth O
's O
foundations O
were O
uncovered O
. O

The O
Lord O
reached O
down O
from O
above O
and O
grabbed O
me O
. O

He O
pulled O
me O
from O
the O
deep O
water O
. O

He O
saved O
me O
from O
my O
powerful O
enemies O
, O
who O
hated O
me O
. O

They O
were O
too O
strong O
for O
me O
, O
so O
he O
saved O
me O
. O

They O
attacked O
me O
in O
my O
time O
of O
trouble O
, O
but O
the O
Lord O
was O
there O
to O
support O
me O
. O

He O
was O
pleased O
with O
me O
, O
so O
he O
rescued O
me O
. O

He O
took O
me O
to O
a O
safe O
place O
. O

The O
Lord O
rewarded O
me O
for O
doing O
what O
is O
right O
. O

He O
was O
good O
to O
me O
because O
I O
am O
innocent O
. O

The O
Lord O
did O
this O
because O
I O
have O
obeyed O
him O
. O

I O
have O
not O
turned O
against O
my O
God O
. O

I O
always O
remembered O
his O
laws O
. O

I O
never O
stopped O
following O
his O
rules O
. O

He O
knows O
I O
did O
nothing O
that O
was O
wrong O
. O

I O
have O
kept O
myself O
from O
sinning O
. O

So O
the O
Lord O
rewarded O
me O
for O
doing O
what O
is O
right O
. O

He O
could O
see O
that O
I O
am O
innocent O
. O

Lord O
, O
you O
are O
faithful O
to O
those O
who O
are O
faithful O
. O

You O
are O
good O
to O
those O
who O
are O
good O
. O

You O
never O
do O
wrong O
to O
those O
who O
have O
done O
no O
wrong O
. O

But O
you O
outsmart O
the O
wicked O
, O
no O
matter O
how O
clever O
they O
are O
. O

You O
help O
those O
who O
are O
humble O
, O
but O
as O
soon O
as O
you O
see O
the O
proud O
, O
you O
humiliate O
them O
. O

Lord O
, O
you O
are O
my O
lamp O
. O

You O
, O
Lord O
, O
turn O
the O
darkness O
around O
me O
into O
light O
. O

With O
your O
help O
I O
can O
defeat O
an O
army O
. O

If O
my O
God O
is O
with O
me O
, O
I O
can O
climb O
over O
enemy O
walls O
. O

God O
's O
way O
is O
perfect O
. O

The O
Lord O
's O
promise O
always O
proves O
to O
be O
true O
. O

He O
protects O
those O
who O
trust O
in O
him O
. O

There O
is O
no O
God O
except O
the O
Lord O
. O

There O
is O
no O
Rock O
except O
our O
God O
. O

God O
is O
my O
strong O
fortress O
. O

He O
clears O
the O
path O
I O
need O
to O
take O
. O

He O
makes O
my O
feet O
as O
steady O
as O
those O
of O
a O
deer O
. O

Even O
on O
steep O
mountains O
he O
keeps O
me O
from O
falling O
. O

He O
trains O
me O
for O
war O
so O
that O
my O
arms O
can O
bend O
the O
most O
powerful O
bow O
. O

Lord O
, O
you O
have O
given O
me O
your O
shield O
to O
protect O
me O
. O

It O
is O
your O
help O
that O
has O
made O
me O
great O
. O

You O
cleared O
a O
path O
for O
my O
feet O
so O
that O
I O
could O
walk O
without O
stumbling O
. O

I O
chased O
my O
enemies O
and O
defeated O
them O
. O

I O
did O
not O
stop O
until O
they O
were O
destroyed O
. O

I O
destroyed O
my O
enemies O
. O

I O
struck O
them O
down O
. O

They O
did O
not O
get O
up O
again O
. O

They O
fell O
under O
my O
feet O
. O

Lord O
, O
you O
made O
me O
strong O
in O
battle O
. O

You O
made O
my O
enemies O
fall O
before O
me O
. O

You O
made O
my O
enemies O
turn O
and O
run O
away O
. O

I O
destroyed O
those O
who O
hated O
me O
. O

They O
looked O
for O
help O
, O
but O
there O
was O
no O
one O
to O
save O
them O
. O

They O
cried O
out O
to O
the O
Lord O
, O
but O
he O
did O
not O
answer O
them O
. O

I O
beat O
my O
enemies O
to O
pieces O
like O
dust O
on O
the O
ground O
. O

I O
smashed O
them O
and O
walked O
on O
them O
like O
mud O
in O
the O
streets O
. O

You O
saved O
me O
from O
those O
who O
fought O
against O
me O
. O

You O
made O
me O
the O
ruler O
over O
nations O
. O

People O
I O
never O
knew O
now O
serve O
me O
. O

Foreigners O
fall O
helpless O
before O
me O
! O

As O
soon O
as O
they O
heard O
about O
me O
, O
they O
were O
ready O
to O
obey O
. O

They O
lose O
all O
their O
courage O
and O
come O
out O
of O
their O
hiding O
places O
shaking O
with O
fear O
. O

The O
Lord O
lives O
! O

I O
praise O
my O
Rock O
! O

How O
great O
is O
my O
God O
, O
the O
Rock O
who O
saves O
me O
! O

He O
is O
the O
God O
who O
punishes O
my O
enemies O
for O
me O
, O
the O
one O
who O
puts O
people O
under O
my O
rule O
. O

He O
saves O
me O
from O
my O
enemies O
! O

You O
help O
me O
defeat O
those O
who O
attack O
me O
. O

You O
save O
me O
from O
cruel O
people O
. O

Lord O
, O
that O
is O
why O
I O
praise O
you O
among O
the O
nations O
. O

That O
is O
why O
I O
sing O
songs O
of O
praise O
to O
your O
name O
. O

The O
Lord O
helps O
his O
king O
win O
battle O
after O
battle O
. O

He O
shows O
his O
faithful O
love O
to O
the O
one O
he O
has O
chosen O
, O
to O
David O
and O
his O
descendants O
forever O
! O

Later O
David O
asked O
the O
Lord O
for O
advice O
. O

David O
said O
, O
`` O
Should O
I O
take O
control O
of O
any O
of O
the O
cities O
of O
Judah O
? O
'' O

The O
Lord O
said O
to O
David O
, O
`` O
Yes O
. O
'' O

David O
asked O
, O
`` O
Where O
should O
I O
go O
? O
'' O

The O
Lord O
answered O
, O
`` O
To O
Hebron O
. O
'' O

So O
David O
and O
his O
two O
wives O
moved O
to O
Hebron O
. O

-LRB- O
His O
wives O
were O
Ahinoam O
from O
Jezreel O
and O
Abigail O
, O
who O
had O
been O
the O
wife O
of O
Nabal O
from O
Carmel O
. O
-RRB- O

David O
also O
brought O
his O
men O
and O
their O
families O
. O

All O
of O
them O
made O
their O
homes O
in O
Hebron O
and O
the O
towns O
nearby O
. O

The O
men O
of O
Judah O
came O
to O
Hebron O
and O
anointed O
David O
to O
be O
the O
king O
of O
Judah O
. O

Then O
they O
told O
David O
, O
`` O
The O
men O
of O
Jabesh O
Gilead O
buried O
Saul O
. O
'' O

David O
sent O
messengers O
to O
the O
men O
of O
Jabesh O
Gilead O
. O

These O
messengers O
told O
the O
men O
in O
Jabesh O
: O
`` O
The O
Lord O
bless O
you O
, O
because O
you O
have O
shown O
kindness O
to O
your O
lord O
Saul O
by O
burying O
him O
. O

The O
Lord O
will O
be O
kind O
and O
true O
to O
you O
, O
and O
so O
will O
I O
. O

Now O
be O
strong O
and O
brave O
. O

Your O
lord O
, O
Saul O
, O
is O
dead O
, O
but O
the O
tribe O
of O
Judah O
has O
anointed O
me O
to O
be O
their O
king O
. O
'' O

Abner O
son O
of O
Ner O
was O
the O
captain O
of O
Saul O
's O
army O
. O

Abner O
took O
Ish O
Bosheth O
son O
of O
Saul O
to O
Mahanaim O
and O
made O
him O
king O
of O
Gilead O
, O
Asher O
, O
Jezreel O
, O
Ephraim O
, O
Benjamin O
, O
and O
all O
Israel O
. O

Ish O
Bosheth O
son O
of O
Saul O
was O
40 O
years O
old O
when O
he O
began O
to O
rule O
over O
Israel O
. O

He O
ruled O
Israel O
two O
years O
, O
but O
the O
tribe O
of O
Judah O
followed O
David O
. O

David O
ruled O
over O
the O
tribe O
of O
Judah O
from O
Hebron O
for O
seven O
years O
and O
six O
months O
. O

Abner O
son O
of O
Ner O
and O
the O
officers O
of O
Ish O
Bosheth O
son O
of O
Saul O
left O
Mahanaim O
and O
went O
to O
Gibeon O
. O

Joab O
, O
Zeruiah O
's O
son O
, O
and O
the O
officers O
of O
David O
also O
went O
to O
Gibeon O
. O

They O
met O
Abner O
and O
Ish O
Bosheth O
's O
officers O
at O
the O
pool O
of O
Gibeon O
. O

Abner O
's O
group O
sat O
on O
one O
side O
of O
the O
pool O
. O

Joab O
's O
group O
sat O
on O
the O
other O
side O
. O

Abner O
said O
to O
Joab O
, O
`` O
Let O
's O
have O
the O
young O
soldiers O
get O
up O
and O
have O
a O
contest O
here O
. O
'' O

Joab O
said O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
let O
's O
have O
a O
contest O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
young O
soldiers O
got O
up O
. O

The O
two O
groups O
counted O
their O
men O
for O
the O
contest O
. O

They O
chose O
twelve O
men O
from O
the O
tribe O
of O
Benjamin O
to O
fight O
for O
Ish O
Bosheth O
son O
of O
Saul O
, O
and O
they O
chose O
twelve O
men O
from O
David O
's O
officers O
. O

Each O
of O
the O
men O
grabbed O
his O
opponent O
's O
head O
and O
stabbed O
him O
in O
the O
side O
with O
his O
sword O
, O
and O
then O
they O
fell O
down O
together O
. O

That O
is O
why O
this O
place O
in O
Gibeon O
is O
called O
`` O
The O
Field O
of O
the O
Sharp O
Knives O
. O
'' O

That O
contest O
turned O
into O
a O
terrible O
battle O
and O
David O
's O
officers O
defeated O
Abner O
and O
the O
Israelites O
that O
day O
. O

Zeruiah O
had O
three O
sons O
, O
Joab O
, O
Abishai O
, O
and O
Asahel O
. O

Asahel O
was O
a O
fast O
runner O
, O
as O
fast O
as O
a O
wild O
deer O
. O

Asahel O
ran O
straight O
toward O
Abner O
and O
began O
chasing O
him O
. O

Abner O
looked O
back O
and O
asked O
, O
`` O
Is O
that O
you O
, O
Asahel O
? O
'' O

Asahel O
said O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
it O
's O
me O
. O
'' O

Abner O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
hurt O
Asahel O
, O
so O
he O
said O
to O
Asahel O
, O
`` O
Stop O
chasing O
me O
-- O
go O
after O
one O
of O
the O
young O
soldiers O
. O

You O
could O
easily O
take O
his O
armor O
for O
yourself O
. O
'' O

But O
Asahel O
refused O
to O
stop O
chasing O
Abner O
. O

Abner O
again O
said O
to O
Asahel O
, O
`` O
Stop O
chasing O
me O
, O
or O
I O
will O
have O
to O
kill O
you O
. O

Then O
I O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
look O
your O
brother O
Joab O
in O
the O
face O
again O
. O
'' O

But O
Asahel O
refused O
to O
stop O
chasing O
Abner O
. O

So O
Abner O
used O
the O
back O
end O
of O
his O
spear O
and O
pushed O
it O
into O
Asahel O
's O
stomach O
. O

The O
spear O
went O
deep O
into O
Asahel O
's O
stomach O
and O
came O
out O
of O
his O
back O
. O

Asahel O
died O
right O
there O
. O

Asahel O
's O
body O
lay O
on O
the O
ground O
. O

Everyone O
who O
came O
that O
way O
stopped O
to O
look O
at O
Asahel O
, O
but O
Joab O
and O
Abishai O
continued O
chasing O
Abner O
. O

The O
sun O
was O
just O
going O
down O
when O
they O
came O
to O
Ammah O
Hill O
. O

-LRB- O
Ammah O
Hill O
is O
in O
front O
of O
Giah O
on O
the O
way O
to O
the O
Gibeon O
Desert O
. O
-RRB- O

The O
men O
from O
the O
tribe O
of O
Benjamin O
gathered O
around O
Abner O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
hill O
. O

Abner O
shouted O
to O
Joab O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Must O
we O
fight O
and O
kill O
each O
other O
forever O
? O

Surely O
you O
know O
that O
this O
will O
only O
end O
in O
sadness O
. O

Tell O
the O
people O
to O
stop O
chasing O
their O
own O
brothers O
. O
'' O

Then O
Joab O
said O
, O
`` O
As O
surely O
as O
God O
is O
alive O
, O
if O
you O
had O
not O
said O
something O
, O
people O
would O
still O
be O
chasing O
their O
brothers O
in O
the O
morning O
. O
'' O

So O
Joab O
blew O
a O
trumpet O
, O
and O
his O
people O
stopped O
chasing O
the O
Israelites O
. O

They O
did O
not O
try O
to O
fight O
the O
Israelites O
anymore O
. O

Abner O
and O
his O
men O
marched O
all O
night O
through O
the O
Jordan O
Valley O
. O

They O
crossed O
the O
Jordan O
River O
and O
then O
marched O
all O
day O
until O
they O
came O
to O
Mahanaim O
. O

Joab O
stopped O
chasing O
Abner O
and O
turned O
back O
. O

Joab O
had O
gathered O
his O
men O
and O
learned O
that O
19 O
of O
David O
's O
officers O
were O
missing O
, O
including O
Asahel O
. O

But O
David O
's O
officers O
had O
killed O
360 O
of O
Abner O
's O
men O
from O
the O
tribe O
of O
Benjamin O
. O

David O
's O
officers O
took O
Asahel O
and O
buried O
him O
in O
the O
tomb O
of O
his O
father O
at O
Bethlehem O

Joab O
and O
his O
men O
marched O
all O
night O
. O

The O
sun O
came O
up O
just O
as O
they O
reached O
Hebron O
. O

While O
David O
was O
king O
, O
there O
was O
a O
famine O
that O
continued O
for O
three O
years O
. O

So O
David O
prayed O
to O
the O
Lord O
. O

And O
the O
Lord O
answered O
, O
`` O
Saul O
and O
his O
family O
of O
murderers O
are O
the O
reason O
for O
the O
famine O
, O
because O
he O
killed O
the O
Gibeonites O
. O
'' O

-LRB- O
The O
Gibeonites O
were O
not O
Israelites O

They O
were O
a O
group O
of O
Amorites O
. O

The O
Israelites O
had O
promised O
not O
to O
hurt O
them O
, O
but O
Saul O
tried O
to O
kill O
the O
Gibeonites O
. O

He O
did O
this O
because O
of O
his O
strong O
feelings O
for O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
and O
Judah O
. O
-RRB- O

King O
David O
called O
the O
Gibeonites O
together O
and O
talked O
to O
them O
. O

David O
said O
to O
the O
Gibeonites O
, O
`` O
What O
can O
I O
do O
for O
you O
? O

What O
can O
I O
do O

take O
away O
Israel O

, O
so O
that O
you O
can O
bless O
the O
Lord O

people O

'' O

The O
Gibeonites O
said O
to O
David O
, O
`` O
There O
is O

enough O
gold O
and O
silver O
for O
Saul O

But O
we O
do O
n't O
have O
the O
right O
to O
kill O
anyone O
else O
in O
Israel O

'' O

David O
said O
, O
`` O
Well O
, O
what O
can O
I O
do O
for O
you O
? O
'' O

The O
Gibeonites O
said O
to O
King O
David O
, O
`` O
The O
person O
who O
plotted O
against O

was O

destroy O
all O

Give O
us O
seven O
of O
Saul O

Saul O
was O
the O
Lord O

chosen O
king O

so O
we O
will O
hang O
his O
sons O
in O
front O
of O
the O
Lord O
on O
Mount O
Gibeah O
of O
Saul O

King O
David O
said O

`` O
All O

I O

give O
them O

But O
the O
king O
protected O
Jonathan O

son O

Mephibosheth O

Jonathan O
was O
Saul O

son O

and O
David O
had O
made O
a O
promise O
in O
the O
Lord O

So O
the O
king O
did O
not O
let O
them O
hurt O
Mephibosheth O

David O
gave O
them O
Armoni O
and O
Mephibosheth O

These O
were O
the O
sons O
of O
Saul O

Rizpah O

Saul O
also O
had O
a O

named O
Merab O
who O
was O
married O
to O
Adriel O
son O

David O
took O
the O
five O

David O
gave O
these O
seven O

then O
brought O
them O
to O
Mount O

died O

during O
the O
first O
days O
of O
the O
barley O

Rizpah O
the O
daughter O

took O
a O
mourning O

put O
it O

Rizpah O

the O

at O

People O
told O
David O
what O
Saul O

slave O

Rizpah O

Then O
David O

Jabesh O

stole O

After O

the O

that O

The O
Philistines O
started O
another O
war O

Israel O

David O
and O
his O

went O
out O
to O
fight O
the O
Philistines O

but O
David O
became O
very O
tired O

weak O

Ishbi O
Benob O
was O
one O
of O
the O
giants O

His O
spear O
weighed O
about O
7 O
1/2 O

Ishbi O
Benob O

but O
Abishai O
son O

killed O

Then O
David O

made O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
can O

If O
you O

Sibbecai O
the O

Elhanan O

His O
spear O
was O
as O
big O

There O
was O
another O

There O
was O
a O

had O
six O

six O

He O
had O
24 O

This O
man O
was O
also O
one O
of O
the O
giants O

This O
man O
challenged O
Israel O
and O
made O
fun O
of O
them O

Jonathan O
killed O
this O

This O

All O
four O

these O
men O
were O

They O
were O
killed O
by O
David O
and O
his O

Later O
David O
defeated O
the O
Philistines O
and O
took O
control O
of O
a O
large O
area O
of O
land O
around O
Gath O

He O
also O
defeated O
the O
Moabites O

He O
forced O
them O
to O
lie O
on O
the O
ground O
in O
a O
long O
row O

Using O
a O
rope O
to O
measure O

those O

two O

of O
the O
rope O
were O
killed O
and O
those O
within O
every O
third O

were O
allowed O
to O
live O
. O

So O
the O
Moabites O
became O
servants O
of O
David O
and O
paid O
tribute O
to O
him O

David O
went O
to O
an O

Then O
David O

The O
Arameans O
became O

The O

One O

From O

David O

asked O

An O

`` O

She O

She O
went O

then O
she O
went O

Later O

Bathsheba O

She O
sent O

David O
sent O
a O
message O

`` O

So O
Joab O
sent O
Uriah O
to O
David O

When O
Uriah O
came O

David O
asked O
him O
how O
Joab O
was O

how O
the O

how O
the O

Then O
David O
said O
to O
Uriah O

`` O
Go O
home O

So O
Uriah O
left O
the O
king O

The O
king O
also O
sent O
a O
gift O
to O
Uriah O

But O
Uriah O
did O
not O
go O

The O

told O
David O

`` O
Uriah O

Then O
David O

to O
Uriah O

`` O
You O
came O

Why O

it O
is O
not O

As O

David O

David O
called O

Uriah O

The O

carry O
the O
letter O
. O

In O
the O
letter O
David O
wrote O
: O
`` O
Put O
Uriah O
on O
the O
front O
lines O
where O
the O
fighting O
is O
the O
hardest O
. O

Then O
leave O
him O
there O
alone O
, O
and O
let O
him O
be O
killed O
in O
battle O
. O
'' O

Joab O
watched O
the O
city O
and O
saw O
where O
the O
bravest O
Ammonites O
were O
. O

He O
chose O
Uriah O
to O
go O
to O
that O
place O
. O

The O
men O
of O
the O
city O
came O
out O
to O
fight O
against O
Joab O
. O

Some O
of O
David O
's O
men O
were O
killed O
. O

Uriah O
the O
Hittite O
was O
one O
of O
them O
. O

Then O
Joab O
sent O
a O
report O
to O
David O
about O
what O
happened O
in O
the O
battle O
. O

Joab O
told O
the O
messenger O
to O
tell O
King O
David O
what O
had O
happened O
in O
the O
battle O
. O

`` O
The O
king O
might O
get O
upset O
and O
ask O
, O
' O
Why O
did O
Joab O
's O
army O
go O
that O
close O
to O
the O
city O
to O
fight O
? O

Surely O
he O
knows O
that O
there O
are O
men O
on O
the O
city O
walls O
who O
can O
shoot O
arrows O
down O
at O
his O
men O
? O

Surely O
he O
remembers O
that O
at O
Thebez O
a O
woman O
killed O
Abimelech O
son O
of O
Jerub O
Besheth O
when O
he O
threw O
the O
top O
part O
of O
a O
grinding O
stone O
down O
from O
the O
wall O
. O

So O
why O
did O
he O
go O
that O
close O
to O
the O
wall O
? O
' O

If O
King O
David O
says O
something O
like O
that O
, O
tell O
him O
, O
' O
Your O
officer O
, O
Uriah O
the O
Hittite O
, O
also O
died O
. O
' O
'' O

The O
messenger O
went O
in O
and O
told O
David O
everything O
Joab O
told O
him O
to O
say O
. O

The O
messenger O
told O
David O
, O
`` O
The O
men O
of O
Ammon O
attacked O
us O
in O
the O
field O
. O

We O
fought O
them O
and O
chased O
them O
all O
the O
way O
to O
the O
city O
gate O
. O

Then O
the O
men O
on O
the O
city O
wall O
shot O
arrows O
at O
your O
officers O
. O

Some O
of O
your O
officers O
were O
killed O
, O
including O
Uriah O
the O
Hittite O
. O
'' O

David O
said O
to O
the O
messenger O
, O
`` O
Give O
this O
message O
to O
Joab O
: O
' O
Do O
n't O
be O
too O
upset O
about O
this O

A O
sword O
can O
kill O
one O
person O
as O
well O
as O
the O
next O
. O

Make O
a O
stronger O
attack O
against O
Rabbah O
and O
you O
will O
win O
. O
' O

Encourage O
Joab O
with O
these O
words O
. O
'' O

Bathsheba O
heard O
that O
her O
husband O
Uriah O
had O
died O
, O
so O
she O
mourned O
for O
him O
. O

After O
her O
time O
of O
sadness O
, O
David O
sent O
servants O
to O
bring O
her O
to O
his O
house O
. O

She O
became O
David O
's O
wife O
and O
gave O
birth O
to O
a O
son O
for O
David O
. O

But O
the O
Lord O
did O
not O
like O
what O
David O
had O
done O
. O

The O
Lord O
sent O
Nathan O
to O
David O
. O

Nathan O
went O
to O
him O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
There O
were O
two O
men O
in O
a O
city O
. O

One O
man O
was O
rich O
, O
but O
the O
other O
man O
was O
poor O
. O

The O
rich O
man O
had O
lots O
of O
sheep O
and O
cattle O
. O

But O
the O
poor O
man O
had O
nothing O
except O
one O
little O
female O
lamb O
that O
he O
bought O
. O

The O
poor O
man O
fed O
the O
lamb O
, O
and O
the O
lamb O
grew O
up O
with O
this O
poor O
man O
and O
his O
children O
. O

She O
ate O
from O
the O
poor O
man O
's O
food O
and O
drank O
from O
his O
cup O
. O

The O
lamb O
slept O
on O
the O
poor O
man O
's O
chest O
. O

The O
lamb O
was O
like O
a O
daughter O
to O
the O
poor O
man O
. O

`` O
Then O
a O
traveler O
stopped O
to O
visit O
the O
rich O
man O
. O

The O
rich O
man O
wanted O
to O
give O
food O
to O
the O
traveler O
, O
but O
he O
did O
not O
want O
to O
take O
any O
of O
his O
own O
sheep O
or O
cattle O
to O
feed O
the O
traveler O
. O

No O
, O
the O
rich O
man O
took O
the O
lamb O
from O
the O
poor O
man O
and O
cooked O
it O
for O
his O
visitor O
. O
'' O

David O
became O
very O
angry O
with O
the O
rich O
man O
. O

He O
said O
to O
Nathan O
, O
`` O
As O
the O
Lord O
lives O
, O
the O
man O
who O
did O
this O
should O
die O
! O

He O
must O
pay O
four O
times O
the O
price O
of O
the O
lamb O
because O
he O
did O
this O
terrible O
thing O
and O
because O
he O
had O
no O
mercy O
. O
'' O

Then O
Nathan O
said O
to O
David O
, O
`` O
You O
are O
that O
rich O
man O
! O

This O
is O
what O
the O
Lord O
, O
the O
God O
of O
Israel O
, O
says O
: O
' O
I O
chose O
you O
to O
be O
the O
king O
of O
Israel O
. O

I O
saved O
you O
from O
Saul O
. O

I O
let O
you O
take O
his O
family O
and O
his O
wives O
, O
and O
I O
made O
you O
king O
of O
Israel O
and O
Judah O
. O

As O
if O
that O
had O
not O
been O
enough O
, O
I O
would O
have O
given O
you O
more O
and O
more O
. O

So O
why O
did O
you O
ignore O
my O
command O
? O

Why O
did O
you O
do O
what O
I O
say O
is O
wrong O
? O

You O
let O
the O
Ammonites O
kill O
Uriah O
the O
Hittite O
, O
and O
you O
took O
his O
wife O
. O

It O
is O
as O
if O
you O
yourself O
killed O
Uriah O
in O
war O
. O

So O
your O
family O
will O
never O
have O
peace O
! O

When O
you O
took O
Uriah O
's O
wife O
, O
you O
showed O
that O
you O
did O
not O
respect O
me O
. O
' O

`` O
This O
is O
what O
the O
Lord O
says O
: O
' O
I O
am O
bringing O
trouble O
against O
you O
. O

This O
trouble O
will O
come O
from O
your O
own O
family O
. O

I O
will O
take O
your O
wives O
from O
you O
and O
give O
them O
to O
someone O
who O
is O
very O
close O
to O
you O
. O

He O
will O
have O
sexual O
relations O
with O
your O
wives O
, O
and O
everyone O
will O
know O
it O
! O

You O
had O
sexual O
relations O
with O
Bathsheba O
in O
secret O
, O
but O
I O
will O
punish O
you O
so O
that O
all O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
can O
see O
it O
. O
' O
'' O

Then O
David O
said O
to O
Nathan O
, O
`` O
I O
have O
sinned O
against O
the O
Lord O
. O
'' O

Nathan O
said O
to O
David O
, O
`` O
The O
Lord O
will O
forgive O
you O
, O
even O
for O
this O
sin O
. O

You O
will O
not O
die O
. O

But O
you O
did O
things O
that O
made O
the O
Lord O
's O
enemies O
lose O
their O
respect O
for O
him O
, O
so O
your O
new O
baby O
son O
will O
die O
. O
'' O

Then O
Nathan O
went O
home O
. O

And O
the O
Lord O
caused O
the O
baby O
boy O
who O
was O
born O
to O
David O
and O
Uriah O
's O
wife O
to O
become O
very O
sick O
. O

David O
prayed O
to O
God O
for O
the O
baby O
. O

David O
refused O
to O
eat O
or O
drink O
. O

He O
went O
into O
his O
house O
and O
stayed O
there O
and O
lay O
on O
the O
ground O
all O
night O
. O

The O
leaders O
of O
David O
's O
family O
came O
and O
tried O
to O
pull O
David O
up O
from O
the O
ground O
, O
but O
he O
refused O
to O
get O
up O
. O

He O
refused O
to O
eat O
with O
these O
leaders O
. O

On O
the O
seventh O
day O
the O
baby O
died O
. O

David O
's O
servants O
were O
afraid O
to O
tell O
him O
that O
the O
baby O
was O
dead O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Look O
, O
we O
tried O
to O
talk O
to O
David O
while O
the O
baby O
was O
alive O
, O
but O
he O
refused O
to O
listen O
to O
us O
. O

If O
we O
tell O
David O
that O
the O
baby O
is O
dead O
, O
he O
might O
do O
something O
bad O
to O
himself O
. O
'' O

David O
saw O
his O
servants O
whispering O
and O
understood O
that O
the O
baby O
was O
dead O
. O

So O
David O
asked O
his O
servants O
, O
`` O
Is O
the O
baby O
dead O
? O
'' O

The O
servants O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
he O
is O
dead O
. O
'' O

Then O
David O
got O
up O
from O
the O
floor O
. O

He O
washed O
himself O
. O

He O
changed O
his O
clothes O
and O
got O
dressed O
. O

Then O
he O
went O
into O
the O
Lord O
's O
house O
to O
worship O
. O

After O
that O
he O
went O
home O
and O
asked O
for O
something O
to O
eat O
. O

His O
servants O
gave O
him O
some O
food O
, O
and O
he O
ate O
. O

David O
's O
servants O
asked O
him O
, O
`` O
Why O
are O
you O
doing O
this O
? O

When O
the O
baby O
was O
alive O
, O
you O
cried O
and O
refused O
to O
eat O
. O

But O
when O
the O
baby O
died O
you O
got O
up O
and O
ate O
food O
. O
'' O

David O
said O
, O
`` O
While O
the O
baby O
was O
still O
living O
, O
I O
cried O
and O
refused O
to O
eat O
because O
I O
thought O
, O
' O
Who O
knows O
? O

Maybe O
the O
Lord O
will O
feel O
sorry O
for O
me O
and O
let O
the O
baby O
live O
. O
' O

But O
now O
the O
baby O
is O
dead O
, O
so O
why O
should O
I O
refuse O
to O
eat O
? O

Can O
I O
bring O
the O
baby O
back O
to O
life O
? O

No O
. O

Some O
day O
I O
will O
go O
to O
him O
, O
but O
he O
can O
not O
come O
back O
to O
me O
. O
'' O

Then O
David O
comforted O
Bathsheba O
his O
wife O
. O

He O
slept O
with O
her O
and O
had O
sexual O
relations O
with O
her O
. O

Bathsheba O
became O
pregnant O
again O
and O
had O
another O
son O
. O

David O
named O
the O
boy O
Solomon O
. O

The O
Lord O
loved O
Solomon O
. O

The O
Lord O
sent O
word O
through O
Nathan O
the O
prophet O
. O

Nathan O
gave O
Solomon O
the O
name O
, O
Jedidiah O
. O

Nathan O
did O
this O
for O
the O
Lord O
. O

Rabbah O
was O
the O
capital O
city O
of O
the O
Ammonites O
. O

Joab O
fought O
against O
Rabbah O
and O
captured O
it O
. O

Joab O
sent O
messengers O
to O
David O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
have O
fought O
against O
Rabbah O
and O
have O
captured O
its O
water O
supply O
. O

Now O
bring O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
army O
together O
and O
attack O
Rabbah O
. O

Capture O
this O
city O
before O
I O
do O
, O
or O
else O
it O
will O
be O
called O
by O
my O
name O
. O
'' O

So O
David O
gathered O
all O
the O
soldiers O
together O
and O
went O
to O
Rabbah O
. O

He O
fought O
against O
Rabbah O
and O
captured O
the O
city O
. O

David O
took O
the O
crown O
off O
their O
king O
's O
head O
. O

The O
crown O
was O
gold O
and O
weighed O
about O
75 O
pounds O
. O

This O
crown O
had O
precious O
stones O
in O
it O
. O

They O
put O
the O
crown O
on O
David O
's O
head O
. O

David O
took O
many O
valuable O
things O
out O
of O
the O
city O
. O

David O
also O
brought O
out O
the O
people O
of O
the O
city O
of O
Rabbah O
and O
made O
them O
work O
with O
saws O
, O
iron O
picks O
, O
and O
axes O
. O

He O
also O
forced O
them O
to O
build O
things O
with O
bricks O
. O

He O
did O
the O
same O
thing O
to O
all O
the O
Ammonite O
cities O
. O

Then O
David O
and O
the O
army O
went O
back O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

Joab O
son O
of O
Zeruiah O
knew O
that O
King O
David O
missed O
Absalom O
very O
much O
. O

So O
Joab O
sent O
messengers O
to O
Tekoa O
to O
bring O
a O
wise O
woman O
from O
there O
. O

Joab O
said O
to O
this O
wise O
woman O
, O
`` O
Please O
pretend O
to O
be O
very O
sad O
. O

Put O
on O
sackcloth O
. O

Do O
n't O
dress O
up O
. O

Act O
like O
a O
woman O
who O
has O
been O
crying O
many O
days O
for O
someone O
who O
died O
. O

Go O
to O
the O
king O
and O
talk O
to O
him O
using O
these O
words O
that O
I O
tell O
you O
. O
'' O

Then O
Joab O
told O
the O
wise O
woman O
what O
to O
say O
. O

Then O
the O
woman O
from O
Tekoa O
talked O
to O
the O
king O
. O

She O
bowed O
with O
her O
face O
to O
the O
ground O
. O

Then O
she O
said O
, O
`` O
King O
, O
please O
help O
me O
! O
'' O

King O
David O
said O
to O
her O
, O
`` O
What O
's O
your O
problem O
? O
'' O

The O
woman O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
a O
widow O
. O

My O
husband O
is O
dead O
. O

I O
had O
two O
sons O

They O
were O
out O
in O
the O
field O
fighting O
. O

There O
was O
no O
one O
to O
stop O
them O
. O

One O
son O
killed O
the O
other O
son O
. O

Now O
the O
whole O
family O
is O
against O
me O
. O

They O
said O
to O
me O
, O
' O
Bring O
us O
the O
son O
who O
killed O
his O
brother O
and O
we O
will O
kill O
him O
, O
because O
he O
killed O
his O
brother O
. O
' O

My O
son O
is O
like O
the O
last O
spark O
of O
a O
fire O
. O

If O
they O
kill O
my O
son O
, O
that O
fire O
will O
burn O
out O
and O
be O
finished O
. O

He O
is O
the O
only O
son O
left O
alive O
to O
get O
his O
father O
's O
property O
. O

So O
my O
dead O
husband O

property O
will O
go O
to O
someone O
else O
and O
his O
name O
will O
be O
removed O
from O
the O
land O

'' O

Then O
the O
king O
said O
to O
the O
woman O
, O
`` O
Go O
home O

I O
will O
take O
care O
of O
things O

you O

The O
woman O
of O
Tekoa O
said O
to O
the O
king O

`` O
Let O
the O

King O
David O

The O

Why O
have O
you O
planned O
these O
things O
against O
the O
people O
of O
God O
? O

When O
you O
say O
these O
things O
, O
you O
show O
you O
are O
guilty O
because O
you O
have O
not O
brought O
back O
the O
son O
who O
you O
forced O
to O
leave O
home O
. O

We O
will O
all O
die O
some O
day O
. O

We O
will O
be O
like O
water O
that O
is O
spilled O
on O
the O
ground O
. O

No O
one O
can O
gather O
this O
water O
back O
from O
the O
ground O

You O
know O
God O
forgives O
people O

God O
made O
plans O
for O
people O
who O
are O
forced O
to O
run O
away O

God O

My O
lord O

king O
, O
I O
came O
to O
say O
these O
words O
to O
you O
, O
because O
the O
people O
made O
me O
afraid O

I O
said O
to O
myself O
, O
' O
I O
will O
talk O
to O
the O
king O

Maybe O
the O
king O
will O
help O
me O

The O
king O
will O
listen O
to O
me O
and O
save O
me O
from O
the O
man O
who O
wants O
to O
kill O
me O
and O
my O

That O
man O
just O
wants O
to O
keep O
us O
from O
getting O
what O
God O
gave O
us O

' O

I O
know O
that O
the O
words O
of O
my O
lord O
the O
king O
will O
give O
me O
rest O
, O
because O
you O
are O
like O
an O
angel O
from O
God O

You O
know O
what O
is O
good O
and O
what O
is O
bad O
. O

And O
the O
Lord O
your O
God O
is O
with O
you O

'' O

King O
David O
answered O
the O
woman O
, O
`` O
You O
must O
answer O
the O
question O
I O
will O
ask O
you O
. O
'' O

The O
woman O
said O
, O
`` O
My O
lord O
and O
king O
, O
please O
ask O
your O
question O
. O
'' O

The O
king O
said O
, O
`` O
Did O
Joab O
tell O
you O
to O
say O
all O
these O
things O
? O
'' O

The O
woman O
answered O
, O
`` O
As O
you O
live O
, O
my O
lord O
and O
king O
, O
you O
are O
right O
. O

Your O
officer O
Joab O
did O
tell O
me O
to O
say O
these O
things O
. O

Joab O
did O
this O
so O
that O
you O
would O
see O
things O
differently O
. O

My O
lord O
, O
you O
are O
as O
wise O
as O
God O
's O
angel O
. O

You O
know O
everything O
that O
happens O
on O
earth O
. O
'' O

The O
king O
said O
to O
Joab O
, O
`` O
Look O
, O
I O
will O
do O
what O
I O
promised O
. O

Now O
please O
bring O
back O
the O
young O
man O
Absalom O
. O
'' O

Joab O
bowed O
with O
his O
face O
on O
the O
ground O
. O

He O
blessed O
King O
David O
, O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Today O
I O
know O
that O
you O
are O
pleased O
with O
me O
. O

I O
know O
because O
you O
have O
done O
what O
I O
asked O
. O
'' O

Then O
Joab O
got O
up O
and O
went O
to O
Geshur O
and O
brought O
Absalom O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

But O
King O
David O
said O
, O
`` O
Absalom O
must O
go O
back O
to O
his O
own O
house O
. O

He O
can O
not O
come O
to O
see O
me O
. O
'' O

So O
Absalom O
went O
back O
to O
his O
own O
house O
, O
but O
he O
could O
not O
go O
to O
see O
the O
king O
. O

People O
really O
bragged O
about O
how O
good-looking O
Absalom O
was O
. O

No O
man O
in O
Israel O
was O
as O
handsome O
as O
Absalom O
. O

Every O
part O
of O
his O
body O
was O
perfect O
-- O
from O
his O
head O
to O
his O
feet O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
every O
year O
, O
Absalom O
cut O
the O
hair O
from O
his O
head O
and O
weighed O
it O
. O

The O
hair O
weighed O
about O
five O
pounds O
. O

Absalom O
had O
three O
sons O
and O
one O
daughter O
. O

Her O
name O
was O
Tamar O
, O
and O
she O
was O
a O
beautiful O
woman O
. O

Absalom O
lived O
in O
Jerusalem O
for O
two O
full O
years O
without O
being O
allowed O
to O
visit O
King O
David O
. O

Absalom O
sent O
a O
message O
to O
Joab O
, O
asking O
for O
permission O
to O
see O
the O
king O
, O
but O
Joab O
refused O
to O
come O
see O
him O
. O

So O
Absalom O
sent O
a O
second O
message O
to O
Joab O
. O

Again O
, O
Joab O
refused O
to O
come O
see O
him O
. O

Then O
Absalom O
said O
to O
his O
servants O
, O
`` O
Look O
, O
Joab O
's O
field O
is O
next O
to O
my O
field O
. O

He O
has O
barley O
growing O
in O
that O
field O
. O

Go O
burn O
the O
barley O
. O
'' O

So O
Absalom O
's O
servants O
went O
and O
started O
a O
fire O
in O
Joab O
's O
field O
. O

Joab O
got O
up O
and O
came O
to O
Absalom O
's O
house O
and O
said O
to O
Absalom O
, O
`` O
Why O
did O
your O
servants O
burn O
my O
field O
? O
'' O

Absalom O
said O
to O
Joab O
, O
`` O
I O
sent O
a O
message O
to O
you O
. O

I O
asked O
you O
to O
come O
here O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
send O
you O
to O
the O
king O
to O
ask O
him O
why O
he O
asked O
me O
to O
come O
home O
from O
Geshur O
. O

I O
can O
not O
see O
him O
, O
so O
it O
would O
have O
been O
better O
for O
me O
to O
stay O
in O
Geshur O
. O

Now O
let O
me O
see O
the O
king O
. O

If O
I O
have O
sinned O
, O
he O
can O
kill O
me O
! O
'' O

Then O
Joab O
came O
to O
the O
king O
and O
told O
him O
what O
Absalom O
said O
. O

The O
king O
called O
for O
Absalom O
. O

Absalom O
came O
to O
the O
king O
and O
bowed O
low O
on O
the O
ground O
before O
the O
king O
. O

The O
king O
kissed O
him O
. O

Ahithophel O
also O
said O
to O
Absalom O
, O
`` O
Now O
, O
let O
me O
choose O
12,000 O
men O
to O
chase O
David O
tonight O
. O

I O
will O
catch O
him O
while O
he O
is O
tired O
and O
weak O
. O

I O
will O
frighten O
him O
, O
and O
all O
his O
people O
will O
run O
away O
. O

But O
I O
will O
kill O
only O
King O
David O
. O

Then O
I O
will O
bring O
all O
the O
people O
back O
to O
you O
. O

If O
David O
is O
dead O
, O
all O
the O
people O
will O
come O
back O
in O
peace O
. O
'' O

This O
plan O
seemed O
good O
to O
Absalom O
and O
all O
the O
leaders O
of O
Israel O
. O

But O
Absalom O
said O
, O
`` O
Now O
call O
Hushai O
the O
Arkite O
. O

I O
also O
want O
to O
hear O
what O
he O
says O
. O
'' O

Hushai O
came O
to O
Absalom O
. O

Absalom O
said O
to O
Hushai O
, O
`` O
This O
is O
the O
plan O
Ahithophel O
gave O
. O

Should O
we O
follow O
it O
? O

If O
not O
, O
tell O
us O
. O
'' O

Hushai O
said O
to O
Absalom O
, O
`` O
Ahithophel O
's O
advice O
is O
not O
good O
this O
time O
. O
'' O

Hushai O
added O
, O
`` O
You O
know O
that O
your O
father O
and O
his O
men O
are O
strong O
men O
. O

They O
are O
as O
dangerous O
as O
a O
wild O
bear O
when O
something O
has O
taken O
its O
cubs O
. O

Your O
father O
is O
a O
skilled O
fighter O
. O

He O
will O
not O
stay O
all O
night O
with O
the O
people O
. O

He O
is O
probably O
already O
hiding O
in O
a O
cave O
or O
some O
other O
place O
. O

If O
your O
father O
attacks O
your O
men O
first O
, O
people O
will O
hear O
the O
news O
and O
think O
, O
' O
Absalom O
's O
followers O
are O
losing O
! O
' O

Then O
even O
your O
bravest O
men O
will O
be O
frightened O
, O
because O
all O
the O
Israelites O
know O
that O
your O
father O
is O
a O
powerful O
soldier O
and O
that O
his O
men O
are O
very O
brave O
. O

`` O
This O
is O
what O
I O
suggest O
: O
You O
must O
gather O
all O
the O
Israelites O
together O
from O
Dan O
to O
Beersheba O
. O

Then O
there O
will O
be O
many O
people O
, O
like O
the O
sand O
by O
the O
sea O
. O

Then O
you O
yourself O
must O
go O
into O
the O
battle O
. O

We O
will O
catch O
David O
wherever O
he O
is O
hiding O
and O
attack O
him O
with O
so O
many O
soldiers O
that O
they O
will O
be O
like O
the O
dew O
that O
covers O
the O
ground O
. O

We O
will O
kill O
David O
and O
all O
of O
his O
men O
-- O
no O
one O
will O
be O
left O
alive O
. O

But O
if O
David O
escapes O
into O
a O
city O
, O
all O
the O
Israelites O
can O
bring O
ropes O
to O
that O
city O
and O
pull O
its O
walls O
down O
into O
the O
valley O
. O

Not O
even O
a O
small O
stone O
will O
be O
left O
in O
that O
city O
. O
'' O

Absalom O
and O
all O
the O
Israelites O
said O
, O
`` O
Hushai O
's O
advice O
is O
better O
than O
Ahithophel O
's O
. O
'' O

Actually O
, O
Ahithophel O
's O
advice O
was O
good O
, O
but O
they O
said O
this O
because O
the O
Lord O
had O
decided O
to O
make O
Ahithophel O
's O
advice O
useless O
. O

He O
did O
this O
to O
punish O
Absalom O
. O

Hushai O
told O
the O
priests O
, O
Zadok O
and O
Abiathar O
, O
what O
was O
said O
. O

He O
told O
them O
what O
Ahithophel O
suggested O
to O
Absalom O
and O
the O
leaders O
of O
Israel O
. O

Hushai O
also O
told O
them O
what O
he O
himself O
had O
suggested O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Send O
a O
message O
to O
David O
now O
! O

Tell O
him O
not O
to O
spend O
the O
night O
at O
the O
places O
where O
people O
cross O
into O
the O
desert O
. O

Tell O
him O
to O
go O
across O
the O
Jordan O
River O
at O
once O
. O

If O
he O
crosses O
the O
river O
, O
the O
king O
and O
all O
his O
people O
will O
not O
be O
caught O
. O
'' O

The O
priests O
' O
sons O
, O
Jonathan O
and O
Ahimaaz O
, O
did O
not O
want O
to O
be O
seen O
going O
into O
the O
town O
, O
so O
they O
waited O
at O
En O
Rogel O
. O

A O
servant O
girl O
went O
out O
to O
them O
and O
gave O
them O
the O
message O
. O

Then O
Jonathan O
and O
Ahimaaz O
carried O
the O
message O
to O
King O
David O
. O

But O
a O
boy O
saw O
Jonathan O
and O
Ahimaaz O
and O
ran O
to O
tell O
Absalom O
. O

Jonathan O
and O
Ahimaaz O
ran O
away O
quickly O
. O

They O
arrived O
at O
a O
man O
's O
house O
in O
Bahurim O
. O

The O
man O
had O
a O
well O
in O
his O
courtyard O
. O

Jonathan O
and O
Ahimaaz O
went O
down O
into O
this O
well O
. O

The O
man O
's O
wife O
spread O
a O
sheet O
over O
the O
mouth O
of O
the O
well O
and O
covered O
it O
with O
grain O
. O

The O
well O
looked O
like O
a O
pile O
of O
grain O
, O
so O
no O
one O
would O
know O
to O
look O
there O
. O

Absalom O
's O
servants O
came O
to O
the O
woman O
at O
the O
house O
. O

They O
asked O
, O
`` O
Where O
are O
Ahimaaz O
and O
Jonathan O
? O
'' O

The O
woman O
said O
to O
Absalom O
's O
servants O
, O
`` O
They O
have O
already O
crossed O
over O
the O
brook O
. O
'' O

Absalom O
's O
servants O
then O
went O
to O
look O
for O
Jonathan O
and O
Ahimaaz O
, O
but O
they O
could O
not O
find O
them O
. O

So O
Absalom O
's O
servants O
went O
back O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

After O
Absalom O
's O
servants O
left O
, O
Jonathan O
and O
Ahimaaz O
climbed O
out O
of O
the O
well O
and O
went O
to O
King O
David O
. O

They O
said O
to O
David O
, O
`` O
Hurry O
, O
go O
across O
the O
river O
. O

Ahithophel O
is O
planning O
to O
do O
something O
to O
you O
. O
'' O

So O
David O
and O
his O
people O
crossed O
over O
the O
Jordan O
River O
. O

By O
sunrise O
, O
all O
of O
David O
's O
people O
had O
crossed O
the O
Jordan O
River O
. O

No O
one O
was O
left O
behind O
. O

When O
Ahithophel O
saw O
that O
the O
Israelites O
did O
not O
do O
what O
he O
suggested O
, O
he O
saddled O
his O
donkey O
and O
went O
back O
to O
his O
hometown O
. O

He O
made O
plans O
for O
his O
family O
and O
then O
hanged O
himself O
. O

They O
buried O
him O
in O
his O
father O
's O
tomb O
. O

David O
arrived O
at O
Mahanaim O
just O
as O
Absalom O
and O
the O
Israelites O
who O
were O
with O
him O
crossed O
over O
the O
Jordan O
River O
. O

Absalom O
and O
the O
Israelites O
made O
their O
camp O
in O
the O
land O
of O
Gilead O
. O

Absalom O
had O
made O
Amasa O
the O
new O
captain O
of O
the O
army O
. O

He O
took O
Joab O
's O
place O
. O

Amasa O
was O
the O
son O
of O
Ithra O
the O
Ishmaelite O
. O

His O
mother O
was O
Abigail O
, O
the O
daughter O
of O
Nahash O
, O
the O
sister O
of O
Joab O
's O
mother O
, O
Zeruiah O
. O

When O
David O
arrived O
at O
Mahanaim O
, O
Shobi O
, O
Makir O
, O
and O
Barzillai O
were O
there O
. O

Shobi O
son O
of O
Nahash O
was O
from O
the O
Ammonite O
town O
of O
Rabbah O
. O

Makir O
son O
of O
Ammiel O
was O
from O
Lo O
Debar O
. O

Barzillai O
was O
from O
Rogelim O
in O
Gilead O
. O

These O
three O
men O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
people O
are O
tired O
, O
hungry O
, O
and O
thirsty O
from O
the O
desert O
. O
'' O

So O
they O
brought O
many O
things O
to O
David O
and O
those O
with O
him O
. O

They O
brought O
beds O
, O
bowls O
, O
and O
other O
kinds O
of O
dishes O
. O

They O
also O
brought O
wheat O

barley O

flour O

roasted O

beans O
, O
lentils O
, O
dried O
seeds O
, O
honey O
, O
butter O
, O
sheep O
, O
and O
cheese O
made O
from O
cow O

milk O
. O

David O
had O
a O
son O
named O
Absalom O
. O

Absalom O
had O
a O
very O
beautiful O
sister O
named O
Tamar O
. O

Another O
one O
of O
David O
's O
sons O
, O
Amnon O
, O
was O
in O
love O
with O
Tamar O
. O

She O
was O
a O
virgin O
. O

Amnon O
wanted O
her O
very O
much O
, O
but O
he O
did O
not O
think O
it O
was O
possible O
for O
him O
to O
have O
her O
. O

He O
thought O
about O
her O
so O
much O
that O
he O
made O
himself O
sick O
. O

Amnon O
had O
a O
friend O
named O
Jonadab O
son O
of O
Shimeah O
. O

-LRB- O
Shimeah O
was O
David O

brother O

-RRB- O

Jonadab O
was O
a O
very O
clever O
man O

He O
said O
to O
Amnon O
, O
`` O
Every O
day O
you O
look O
thinner O

thinner O

are O

plenty O

so O
why O
are O
you O
losing O
weight O

Tell O
me O

Amnon O
told O
Jonadab O

`` O
I O
love O
Tamar O

she O
is O
the O
sister O

`` O
Go O
to O
bed O
. O

Act O
like O
you O
are O
sick O
. O

Then O
your O
father O
will O
come O
to O
see O
you O
. O

Tell O
him O
, O
' O
Please O
let O
my O
sister O
Tamar O
come O
in O
and O
give O
me O
food O
to O
eat O
. O

Let O
her O
make O
the O
food O
in O
front O
of O
me O
. O

Then O
I O
will O
see O
it O
, O
and O
eat O
it O
from O
her O
hand O
. O
' O
'' O

So O
Amnon O
lay O
down O
in O
bed O
and O
acted O
like O
he O
was O
sick O
. O

King O
David O
came O
in O
to O
see O
Amnon O
. O

He O
said O
to O
King O
David O
, O
`` O
Please O
let O
my O
sister O
Tamar O
come O
in O
. O

Let O
her O
make O
two O
cakes O
for O
me O
while O
I O
watch O
. O

Then O
I O
can O
eat O
from O
her O
hands O
. O
'' O

David O
sent O
messengers O
to O
Tamar O
's O
house O
. O

They O
told O
her O
, O
`` O
Go O
to O
your O
brother O
Amnon O
's O
house O
and O
make O
some O
food O
for O
him O
. O
'' O

So O
Tamar O
went O
to O
the O
house O
of O
her O
brother O
Amnon O
. O

He O
was O
in O
bed O
. O

Tamar O
took O
some O
dough O
, O
pressed O
it O
together O
with O
her O
hands O
, O
and O
cooked O
the O
cakes O
. O

She O
did O
this O
while O
he O
watched O
. O

Then O
Tamar O
took O
the O
cakes O
out O
of O
the O
pan O
and O
set O
them O
out O
for O
him O
. O

But O
he O
refused O
to O
eat O
. O

He O
said O
to O
his O
servants O
, O
`` O
Get O
out O
of O
here O
. O

Leave O
me O
alone O
! O
'' O

So O
all O
of O
his O
servants O
left O
the O
room O
. O

Then O
Amnon O
said O
to O
Tamar O
, O
`` O
Bring O
the O
food O
into O
the O
bedroom O
and O
feed O
me O
by O
hand O
. O
'' O

So O
Tamar O
took O
the O
cakes O
she O
had O
made O
and O
went O
into O
her O
brother O
's O
bedroom O
. O

She O
started O
to O
feed O
Amnon O
, O
but O
he O
grabbed O
her O
hand O
. O

He O
said O
to O
her O
, O
`` O
Sister O
, O
come O
and O
sleep O
with O
me O
. O
'' O

Tamar O
said O
to O
Amnon O
, O
`` O
No O
, O
brother O
! O

Do O
n't O
force O
me O
to O
do O
this O
. O

Do O
n't O
do O
this O
shameful O
thing O
! O

Terrible O
things O
like O
this O
should O
never O
be O
done O
in O
Israel O
! O

I O
would O
never O
get O
rid O
of O
my O
shame O
, O
and O
people O
would O
think O
that O
you O
are O
just O
a O
common O
criminal O
. O

Please O
, O
talk O
with O
the O
king O
. O

He O
will O
let O
you O
marry O
me O
. O
'' O

But O
Amnon O
refused O
to O
listen O
to O
Tamar O
. O

He O
was O
stronger O
than O
she O
was O
, O
so O
he O
forced O
her O
to O
have O
sexual O
relations O
with O
him O
. O

Then O
Amnon O
began O
to O
hate O
Tamar O
. O

He O
hated O
her O
much O
more O
than O
he O
had O
loved O
her O
before O
. O

Amnon O
said O
to O
her O
, O
`` O
Get O
up O
and O
get O
out O
of O
here O
! O
'' O

Tamar O
said O
to O
Amnon O
, O
`` O
No O
! O

Do O
n't O
send O
me O
away O
like O
this O
. O

That O
would O
be O
even O
worse O
than O
what O
you O
did O
before O
! O
'' O

But O
Amnon O
refused O
to O
listen O
to O
Tamar O
. O

He O
called O
his O
servant O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Get O
this O
girl O
out O
of O
this O
room O
, O
now O
! O

And O
lock O
the O
door O
after O
her O
. O
'' O

So O
Amnon O
's O
servant O
led O
Tamar O
out O
of O
the O
room O
and O
locked O
the O
door O
. O

Tamar O
was O
wearing O
a O
long O
robe O
with O
many O
colors O
. O

The O
king O
's O
virgin O
daughters O
wore O
robes O
like O
this O
. O

Tamar O
tore O
her O
robe O
of O
many O
colors O
and O
put O
ashes O
on O
her O
head O
. O

Then O
she O
put O
her O
hand O
on O
her O
head O
and O
began O
crying O
. O

Then O
Tamar O
's O
brother O
Absalom O
said O
to O
her O
, O
`` O
Have O
you O
been O
with O
your O
brother O
Amnon O
? O

Did O
he O
hurt O
you O
? O

Now O
, O
calm O
down O
, O
sister O
. O

Amnon O
is O
your O
brother O
, O
so O
we O
will O
take O
care O
of O
this O
. O

Do O
n't O
let O
it O
upset O
you O
too O
much O
. O
'' O

So O
Tamar O
did O
not O
say O
anything O
. O

She O
quietly O
went O
to O
live O
at O
Absalom O
's O
house O
. O

King O
David O
heard O
the O
news O
and O
became O
very O
angry O
, O
but O
he O
did O
not O
want O
to O
say O
anything O
to O
upset O
Amnon O
, O
because O
he O
loved O
him O
since O
he O
was O
his O
firstborn O
son O
. O

Absalom O
began O
to O
hate O
Amnon O
. O

Absalom O
did O
not O
say O
one O
word O
, O
good O
or O
bad O
, O
to O
Amnon O
, O
but O
he O
hated O
him O
because O
Amnon O
had O
raped O
his O
sister O
Tamar O
. O

Two O
years O
later O
, O
Absalom O
had O
some O
men O
come O
to O
Baal O
Hazor O
to O
cut O
the O
wool O
from O
his O
sheep O
. O

He O
invited O
all O
the O
king O
's O
sons O
to O
come O
and O
watch O
. O

Absalom O
went O
to O
the O
king O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
have O
some O
men O
coming O
to O
cut O
the O
wool O
from O
my O
sheep O
. O

Please O
come O
with O
your O
servants O
and O
watch O
. O
'' O

King O
David O
said O
to O
Absalom O
, O
`` O
No O
, O
son O
. O

We O
will O
not O
all O
go O
. O

It O
will O
be O
too O
much O
trouble O
for O
you O
. O
'' O

Absalom O
begged O
David O
to O
go O
. O

David O
did O
not O
go O
, O
but O
he O
did O
give O
his O
blessing O
. O

Absalom O
said O
, O
`` O
If O
you O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
go O
, O
please O
let O
my O
brother O
Amnon O
go O
with O
me O
. O
'' O

King O
David O
asked O
Absalom O
, O
`` O
Why O
should O
he O
go O
with O
you O
? O
'' O

Absalom O
kept O
begging O
David O
. O

Finally O
, O
David O
let O
Amnon O
and O
all O
the O
king O
's O
other O
sons O
go O
with O
Absalom O
. O

Then O
Absalom O
gave O
this O
command O
to O
his O
servants O
, O
`` O
Watch O
Amnon O
. O

When O
he O
is O
drunk O
and O
feeling O
good O
from O
the O
wine O
, O
I O
will O
give O
you O
the O
command O
. O

You O
must O
attack O
Amnon O
and O
kill O
him O
. O

Do O
n't O
be O
afraid O
of O
being O
punished O
. O

After O
all O
, O
you O
will O
only O
be O
obeying O
my O
command O
. O

Now O
, O
be O
strong O
and O
brave O
. O
'' O

So O
Absalom O
's O
young O
soldiers O
did O
what O
he O
said O
. O

They O
killed O
Amnon O
. O

But O
all O
of O
David O
's O
other O
sons O
escaped O
. O

Each O
son O
got O
on O
his O
mule O
and O
escaped O
. O

The O
king O
's O
sons O
were O
still O
on O
their O
way O
into O
town O
. O

But O
King O
David O
got O
a O
message O
about O
what O
happened O
. O

But O
the O
message O
was O
, O
`` O
Absalom O
has O
killed O
all O
the O
king O
's O
sons O
! O

Not O
one O
of O
the O
sons O
was O
left O
alive O
. O
'' O

King O
David O
tore O
his O
clothes O
and O
lay O
on O
the O
ground O
. O

All O
of O
David O
's O
officers O
standing O
near O
him O
also O
tore O
their O
clothes O
. O

But O
then O
Jonadab O
, O
the O
son O
of O
David O
's O
brother O
Shimeah O
, O
said O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
think O
that O
all O
the O
king O
's O
sons O
were O
killed O
! O

Only O
Amnon O
is O
dead O
. O

Absalom O
has O
been O
planning O
this O
from O
the O
day O
that O
Amnon O
raped O
his O
sister O
Tamar O
. O

My O
lord O
and O
king O
, O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
all O
of O
your O
sons O
are O
dead O
. O

Only O
Amnon O
is O
dead O
. O
'' O

Absalom O
ran O
away O
. O

There O
was O
a O
guard O
standing O
on O
the O
city O
wall O
. O

He O
saw O
many O
people O
coming O
from O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
hill O
, O
and O
went O
to O
tell O
the O
king O
. O

So O
Jonadab O
said O
to O
King O
David O
, O
`` O
Look O
, O
I O
was O
right O
! O

The O
king O
's O
sons O
are O
coming O
. O
'' O

The O
king O
's O
sons O
came O
in O
just O
after O
Jonadab O
said O
that O
. O

They O
were O
crying O
loudly O
. O

David O
and O
all O
of O
his O
officers O
began O
crying O
. O

They O
all O
cried O
very O
hard O
. O

David O
cried O
for O
his O
son O
every O
day O
. O

Absalom O
ran O
away O
to O
Talmai O
son O
of O
Ammihud O
, O
the O
king O
of O
Geshur O
. O

After O
Absalom O
had O
run O
away O
to O
Geshur O
, O
he O
stayed O
there O
for O
three O
years O
. O

King O
David O
was O
comforted O
after O
Amnon O
died O
, O
but O
he O
missed O
Absalom O
very O
much O
. O

David O
again O
gathered O
all O
the O
best O
soldiers O
in O
Israel O
. O

There O
were O
30,000 O
men O
. O

Then O
David O
and O
all O
his O
men O
went O
to O
Baalah O
in O
Judah O
to O
take O
God O
's O
Holy O
Box O
there O
. O

The O
Holy O
Box O
is O
like O
God O
's O
throne O
-- O
people O
go O
there O
to O
call O
on O
the O
name O
of O
the O
Lord O
who O
sits O
as O
king O
above O
the O
Cherub O
angels O
that O
are O
on O
that O
Box O
. O

David O
's O
men O
brought O
the O
Holy O
Box O
out O
of O
Abinadab O
's O
house O
on O
the O
hill O
. O

Then O
they O
put O
God O
's O
Holy O
Box O
on O
a O
new O
wagon O
. O

Uzzah O
and O
Ahio O
, O
sons O
of O
Abinadab O
, O
were O
driving O
the O
new O
wagon O
. O

So O
they O
carried O
the O
Holy O
Box O
out O
of O
Abinadab O
's O
house O
on O
the O
hill O
. O

The O
sons O
of O
Abinadab O
, O
Uzzah O
and O
Ahio O
, O
drove O
the O
new O
wagon O
. O

Ahio O
was O
walking O
in O
front O
of O
the O
Holy O
Box O
. O

David O
and O
all O
the O
Israelites O
were O
dancing O
in O
front O
of O
the O
Lord O
and O
playing O
all O
kinds O
of O
musical O
instruments O
. O

There O
were O
lyres O
, O
harps O
, O
drums O
, O
rattles O
, O
instruments O
made O
from O
cypress O
wood O
, O
and O
cymbals O
. O

When O
David O
's O
men O
came O
to O
the O
threshing O
floor O
of O
Nacon O
, O
the O
oxen O
stumbled O
, O
and O
God O
's O
Holy O
Box O
began O
to O
fall O
off O
the O
wagon O
. O

Uzzah O
caught O
the O
Holy O
Box O
. O

But O
the O
Lord O
was O
angry O
with O
Uzzah O
and O
killed O
him O
for O
that O
mistake O
. O

Uzzah O
showed O
he O
did O
not O
honor O
God O
when O
he O
touched O
the O
Holy O
Box O
, O
so O
he O
died O
there O
by O
God O
's O
Holy O
Box O
. O

David O
was O
upset O
because O
the O
Lord O
had O
killed O
Uzzah O
. O

David O
called O
that O
place O
`` O
Perez O
Uzzah O
. O
'' O

It O
is O
still O
called O
Perez O
Uzzah O
today O
. O

David O
became O
afraid O
of O
the O
Lord O
that O
day O
, O
and O
he O
said O
, O
`` O
How O
can O
I O
bring O
God O
's O
Holy O
Box O
here O
now O
? O
'' O

So O
David O
would O
not O
move O
the O
Lord O
's O
Holy O
Box O
into O
the O
City O
of O
David O
. O

He O
put O
the O
Holy O
Box O
at O
the O
house O
of O
Obed O
Edom O
from O
Gath O
. O

The O
Lord O
's O
Holy O
Box O
stayed O
in O
Obed O
Edom O
's O
house O
for O
three O
months O
. O

The O
Lord O
blessed O
Obed O
Edom O
and O
all O
his O
family O
. O

Later O
people O
told O
David O
, O
`` O
The O
Lord O
has O
blessed O
the O
family O
of O
Obed O
Edom O
and O
everything O
he O
owns O
, O
because O
God O
's O
Holy O
Box O
is O
there O
. O
'' O

So O
David O
went O
and O
brought O
God O
's O
Holy O
Box O
from O
Obed O
Edom O
's O
house O
. O

David O
was O
very O
happy O
and O
excited O
. O

When O
the O
men O
who O
carried O
the O
Lord O
's O
Holy O
Box O
had O
walked O
six O
steps O
, O
they O
stopped O
and O
David O
sacrificed O
a O
bull O
and O
a O
fat O
calf O
. O

David O
was O
dancing O
in O
front O
of O
the O
Lord O
. O

He O
was O
wearing O
a O
linen O
ephod O
. O

David O
and O
all O
the O
Israelites O
were O
excited O
-- O
they O
shouted O
and O
blew O
the O
trumpet O
as O
they O
brought O
the O
Lord O
's O
Holy O
Box O
into O
the O
city O
. O

Saul O
's O
daughter O
Michal O
was O
looking O
out O
the O
window O
. O

While O
the O
Lord O
's O
Holy O
Box O
was O
being O
carried O
into O
the O
city O
, O
David O
was O
jumping O
and O
dancing O
before O
the O
Lord O
. O

Michal O
saw O
this O
, O
and O
she O
was O
upset O
at O
David O
. O

David O
put O
up O
a O
tent O
for O
the O
Holy O
Box O
. O

The O
Israelites O
put O
the O
Lord O
's O
Holy O
Box O
in O
its O
place O
under O
the O
tent O
. O

Then O
David O
offered O
burnt O
offerings O
and O
fellowship O
offerings O
before O
the O
Lord O
. O

After O
David O
had O
finished O
offering O
the O
burnt O
offerings O
and O
the O
fellowship O
offerings O
, O
he O
blessed O
the O
people O
in O
the O
name O
of O
the O
Lord O
All-Powerful O
. O

He O
also O
gave O
a O
share O
of O
bread O
, O
a O
raisin O
cake O
, O
and O
some O
date O
bread O
to O
every O
man O
and O
woman O
of O
Israel O
. O

Then O
all O
the O
people O
went O
home O
. O

David O
went O
back O
to O
bless O
his O
house O
, O
but O
Saul O
's O
daughter O
Michal O
came O
out O
to O
meet O
him O
. O

She O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
king O
of O
Israel O
did O
not O
honor O
himself O
today O
! O

You O
took O
off O
your O
clothes O
in O
front O
of O
your O
servants O
' O
girls O
. O

You O
were O
like O
a O
fool O
who O
takes O
off O
his O
clothes O
without O
shame O
! O
'' O

Then O
David O
said O
to O
Michal O
, O
`` O
The O
Lord O
chose O
me O
, O
not O
your O
father O
or O
anyone O
from O
his O
family O
. O

The O
Lord O
chose O
me O
to O
be O
leader O
of O
his O
people O
, O
the O
Israelites O
. O

So O
I O
will O
continue O
dancing O
and O
celebrating O
in O
front O
of O
the O
Lord O
. O

I O
might O
do O
things O
that O
are O
even O
more O
embarrassing O
! O

Maybe O
you O
will O
not O
respect O
me O
, O
but O
the O
girls O
you O
are O
talking O
about O
are O
proud O
of O
me O
! O
'' O

Saul O
's O
daughter O
Michal O
never O
had O
a O

After O
King O

moved O
into O
his O

the O
Lord O
gave O
him O
some O
relief O
from O
all O
of O

King O
David O
said O
to O
Nathan O

`` O
Look O

Nathan O

`` O
Do O

But O
that O
night O

the O
Lord O

came O
to O
Nathan O
: O
`` O

I O

not O

I O
took O
the O

out O

No O

I O
traveled O
around O

I O
used O

I O
never O

Nathan O
told O
David O
about O

He O
told O

Then O
King O

David O

After O
David O
defeated O
the O
Amalekites O
, O
he O
went O
back O
to O
Ziklag O

This O
was O
just O
after O
Saul O
had O
been O
killed O
. O

David O
had O
been O
there O
two O
days O

Then O
, O
on O
the O
third O
day O
, O
a O
young O
soldier O
from O
Saul O

camp O
came O
to O
Ziklag O

His O
clothes O
were O
torn O
, O
and O
he O
had O
dirt O
on O
his O
head O

He O
came O
to O
David O

bowed O
with O
his O
face O
to O
the O
ground O

David O
asked O
him O
, O
`` O
Where O
have O
you O
come O
from O

The O
man O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
just O
came O
from O
the O
Israelite O
camp O

David O
asked O
him O
, O
`` O
Please O
tell O
me O
, O
who O
won O
the O
battle O

The O
man O
answered O
, O
`` O
Our O
people O
ran O
away O
from O
the O
battle O

Many O
of O
them O
were O
killed O
in O
the O
battle O

Even O
Saul O
and O
his O
son O
Jonathan O

dead O

David O
said O
to O
the O
young O
soldier O
, O
`` O
How O
do O
you O
know O
Saul O
and O
his O
son O
Jonathan O
are O
dead O

The O
young O
soldier O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
happened O
to O
be O
on O
Mount O
Gilboa O

I O
saw O
Saul O
leaning O
on O
his O
spear O

The O
Philistine O
chariots O
and O
horse O
soldiers O
were O
coming O
closer O
and O
closer O
to O
Saul O

Saul O
looked O
back O
and O
saw O
me O
. O

He O
called O
to O
me O
and O
I O
answered O
him O
. O

Then O
Saul O
asked O
me O
who O
I O
was O
. O

I O
told O
him O
that O
I O
was O
an O
Amalekite O

Then O
Saul O
said O

' O

I O

badly O

I O
am O
about O

He O
was O
hurt O
so O
badly O
that O
I O
knew O
he O
would O

live O

So O
I O
stopped O
and O
killed O
him O

Then O
I O
took O
the O
crown O
from O
his O
head O
and O
the O
bracelet O
from O
his O
arm O
and O
brought O
them O
here O
to O
you O

my O
lord O

Then O
David O
tore O
his O
clothes O
to O
show O
he O
was O
very O
sad O
. O

All O
the O
men O
with O
him O
did O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

They O
were O
very O
sad O
and O
cried O
. O

They O
did O
not O
eat O
until O
evening O
. O

They O
cried O
because O
Saul O
and O
his O
son O
Jonathan O
were O
dead O
. O

David O
and O
his O
men O
cried O
for O
the O
Lord O
's O
people O
, O
and O
they O
cried O
for O
Israel O

They O
cried O
because O
Saul O
, O
his O
son O
Jonathan O
, O
and O
many O
Israelites O
had O
been O
killed O
in O
battle O
. O

Then O
David O
talked O
with O
the O
young O
soldier O
who O
had O
told O
him O
about O
Saul O
's O
death O
. O

David O
asked O
, O
`` O
Where O
are O
you O
from O
? O
'' O

The O
young O
soldier O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
the O
son O
of O
a O
foreigner O

I O
am O
an O
Amalekite O

David O
said O
to O
the O
young O
soldier O
, O
`` O
Why O
were O
you O
not O
afraid O
to O
kill O
the O
Lord O

chosen O
king O

Then O
David O
told O
the O
Amalekite O
, O
`` O
You O
are O
responsible O
for O
your O
own O
death O
. O

You O
said O
you O
killed O
the O
Lord O

so O
your O
own O
words O
prove O
you O

guilty O

Then O
David O
called O
one O
of O
his O
young O
servants O
and O
told O
him O
to O
kill O
the O
Amalekite O
. O

So O
the O
young O
Israelite O
killed O
him O

David O
sang O
a O
sad O
song O
about O
Saul O
and O
his O
son O
Jonathan O

David O
told O
his O
men O
to O
teach O
the O
song O
to O
the O
people O
of O
Judah O

This O
song O
is O
called O
The O
Bow O

it O
is O
written O
in O
the O
Book O

Jashar O

`` O

After O
this O
, O
Absalom O
got O
a O
chariot O
and O
horses O
for O
himself O

He O
had O
50 O
men O
run O
in O
front O
of O
him O
while O
he O
drove O
the O
chariot O

Absalom O
would O
get O
up O
early O
and O
stand O
near O
the O
gate O

He O
would O
watch O
for O
anyone O
with O
problems O
who O
was O
going O
to O
King O
David O
for O
judgment O

Then O
Absalom O
would O
talk O
to O
them O
and O
say O
, O
`` O
What O
city O

you O
from O
? O
'' O

They O
would O
say O
they O
were O
from O
such O
and O
such O
tribe O
in O
Israel O

Then O
Absalom O
would O
say O
, O
`` O
Look O
, O
you O
are O
right O
, O
but O
King O
David O
will O
not O
listen O

you O

Absalom O
would O
also O
say O
, O
`` O
Oh O
, O
I O
wish O
someone O
would O
make O
me O
a O
judge O
in O
this O
country O

Then O
I O
could O
help O
everyone O

I O
would O
help O

And O
if O
anyone O
came O
to O
Absalom O
and O
started O
to O
bow O
down O
to O
him O
, O
Absalom O
would O
treat O
him O
like O
a O
close O
friend O

he O
would O
reach O
out O

touch O
him O

Absalom O
did O
that O
to O
all O
the O

came O

In O
this O
way O
Absalom O
won O
the O
hearts O

all O
the O

After O
four O
years O
, O
Absalom O
said O

back O

Jerusalem O
, O
I O
will O
serve O
the O
Lord O
in O
a O
special O
way O

' O
'' O

King O
David O
said O
, O
`` O
Go O
in O
peace O
. O
'' O

Absalom O
went O
to O
Hebron O
. O

But O
he O
also O
sent O
spies O
to O
all O
the O
tribes O
of O
Israel O
. O

They O
told O
the O
people O
, O
`` O
When O
you O
hear O
the O
trumpet O
, O
say O
, O
' O
Absalom O
is O
king O
in O
Hebron O
! O
' O
'' O

Absalom O
invited O
200 O
men O
to O
go O
with O
him O
. O

They O
left O
Jerusalem O
with O
him O
, O
but O
they O
did O
not O
know O
what O
he O
was O
planning O
. O

Ahithophel O
was O
one O
of O
David O
's O
advisors O
. O

He O
was O
from O
the O
town O
of O
Giloh O
. O

While O
Absalom O
was O
offering O
sacrifices O
, O
he O
invited O
Ahithophel O
to O
join O
. O

Absalom O
's O
plans O
were O
working O
very O
well O
and O
more O
and O
more O
people O
began O
to O
support O
him O
. O

A O
man O
came O
in O
to O
tell O
the O
news O
to O
David O
. O

The O
man O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
people O
of O
Israel O
are O
beginning O
to O
follow O
Absalom O
. O
'' O

Then O
David O
said O
to O
all O
of O
his O
officers O
who O
were O
still O
in O
Jerusalem O
with O
him O
, O
`` O
Come O
on O
, O
we O
can O
not O
let O
him O
trap O
us O
here O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

Hurry O
up O
, O
before O
he O
catches O
us O
. O

He O
will O
destroy O
us O
all O
, O
and O
Jerusalem O
will O
be O
destroyed O
in O
the O
battle O
. O
'' O

The O
king O
's O
officers O
told O
him O
, O
`` O
We O
will O
do O
whatever O
you O
tell O
us O
. O
'' O

King O
David O
left O
with O
everyone O
in O
his O
family O
, O
except O
ten O
of O
his O
slave O
women O
. O

He O
left O
them O
to O
take O
care O
of O
the O
house O
. O

The O
king O
left O
with O
everyone O
in O
his O
house O
following O
him O
on O
foot O
. O

They O
stopped O
at O
the O
last O
house O
. O

All O
the O
king O
's O
officers O
passed O
by O
him O
. O

And O
all O
the O
Kerethites O
, O
all O
the O
Pelethites O
, O
and O
the O
Gittites O
-LRB- O
600 O
men O
from O
Gath O
-RRB- O
passed O
by O
the O
king O
. O

The O
king O
said O
to O
Ittai O
from O
Gath O
, O
`` O
Why O
are O
you O
also O
going O
with O
us O
? O

You O
are O
a O
foreigner O
; O
this O
is O
not O
your O
homeland O
. O

Go O
back O
and O
stay O
with O
the O
new O
king O
. O

You O
came O
to O
join O
me O
only O
yesterday O
. O

You O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
wander O
from O
place O
to O
place O
with O
me O
. O

Take O
your O
brothers O
and O
go O
back O
. O

Go O
with O
my O
faithful O
, O
loving O
kindness O
. O
'' O

But O
Ittai O
answered O
the O
king O
, O
`` O
As O
the O
Lord O
lives O
, O
and O
as O
long O
as O
you O
live O
, O
I O
will O
stay O
with O
you O
, O
in O
life O
or O
death O
! O
'' O

David O
said O
to O
Ittai O
, O
`` O
Then O
come O
, O
let O
's O
go O
cross O
Kidron O
Brook O
. O
'' O

So O
Ittai O
from O
Gath O
and O
all O
of O
his O
people O
and O
their O
children O
crossed O
over O
Kidron O
Brook O
. O

All O
the O
people O
were O
crying O
loudly O
. O

Then O
King O
David O
crossed O
over O
Kidron O
Brook O
, O
and O
all O
the O
people O
went O
out O
to O
the O
desert O
. O

Zadok O
and O
all O
the O
Levites O
with O
him O
were O
carrying O
the O
Box O
of O
God O
's O
Agreement O
. O

They O
set O
down O
God O
's O
Holy O
Box O
, O
and O
Abiathar O
said O
prayers O
until O
all O
the O
people O
had O
left O
Jerusalem O
. O

King O
David O
said O
to O
Zadok O
, O
`` O
Take O
God O
's O
Holy O
Box O
back O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

If O
the O
Lord O
is O
pleased O
with O
me O
, O
he O
will O
bring O
me O
back O
and O
let O
me O
see O
Jerusalem O
and O
his O
Temple O
. O

But O
if O
the O
Lord O
says O
that O
he O
is O
not O
pleased O
with O
me O
, O
let O
him O
do O
whatever O
he O
wants O
to O
me O
. O
'' O

The O
king O
said O
to O
Zadok O
the O
priest O
, O
`` O
You O
are O
a O
seer O
. O

Go O
back O
to O
the O
city O
in O
peace O
. O

Take O
your O
son O
Ahimaaz O
and O
Jonathan O
the O
son O
of O
Abiathar O
. O

I O
will O
be O
waiting O
near O
the O
places O
where O
people O
cross O
the O
river O
into O
the O
desert O
. O

I O
will O
wait O
there O
until O
I O
hear O
from O
you O
. O
'' O

So O
Zadok O
and O
Abiathar O
took O
God O
's O
Holy O
Box O
back O
to O
Jerusalem O
and O
stayed O
there O
. O

David O
walked O
up O
the O
path O
to O
the O
Mount O
of O
Olives O
. O

He O
was O
crying O
, O
his O
head O
was O
covered O
, O
and O
he O
went O
without O
sandals O
on O
his O
feet O
. O

All O
the O
people O
with O
David O
also O
covered O
their O
heads O
and O
were O
crying O
as O
they O
walked O
with O
him O
. O

Someone O
told O
David O
, O
`` O
Ahithophel O
is O
one O
who O
joined O
in O
Absalom O
's O
plot O
against O
you O
. O
'' O

Then O
David O
prayed O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
I O
ask O
you O
to O
make O
Ahithophel O
give O
only O
foolish O
advice O
. O
'' O

When O
David O
got O
to O
the O
top O
of O
the O
mountain O
, O
he O
bowed O
down O
to O
worship O
God O
. O

Then O
David O
noticed O
Hushai O
the O
Arkite O
. O

Hushai O
's O
coat O
was O
torn O
, O
and O
there O
was O
dust O
on O
his O
head O
. O

David O
said O
to O
Hushai O
, O
`` O
If O
you O
go O
with O
me O
, O
you O
will O
be O
just O
one O
more O
person O
to O
care O
for O
. O

But O
if O
you O
go O
back O
to O
Jerusalem O
, O
you O
can O
disagree O
with O
Ahithophel O
and O
make O
his O
advice O
useless O
. O

Tell O
Absalom O
, O
' O
King O
, O
I O
am O
your O
servant O
. O

I O
served O
your O
father O
, O
but O
now O
I O
will O
serve O
you O
. O
' O

The O
priests O
Zadok O
and O
Abiathar O
will O
be O
with O
you O
. O

You O
must O
tell O
them O
everything O
you O
hear O
in O
the O
king O
's O
palace O
. O

Zadok O
's O
son O
Ahimaaz O
and O
Abiathar O
's O
son O
Jonathan O
will O
be O
with O
them O
. O

You O
can O
send O
them O
to O
tell O
me O
everything O
you O
hear O
. O
'' O

So O
David O
's O
friend O
Hushai O
went O
back O
to O
the O
city O
, O
just O
as O
Absalom O
arrived O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

David O
counted O
his O
men O
and O
chose O
captains O
over O
1000 O
and O
captains O
over O
100 O
to O
lead O
them O
. O

He O
separated O
the O
people O
into O
three O
groups O
and O
sent O
them O
out O
. O

Joab O
led O
a O
third O
of O
the O
men O
. O

Joab O
's O
brother O
, O
Abishai O
son O
of O
Zeruiah O
, O
led O
another O
third O
. O

And O
Ittai O
from O
Gath O
led O
the O
last O
third O
. O

King O
David O
said O
to O
the O
people O
, O
`` O
I O
will O
also O
go O
with O
you O
. O
'' O

But O
they O
said O
, O
`` O
No O
! O

You O
must O
not O
go O
with O
us O
. O

If O
we O
run O
away O
in O
the O
battle O
, O
Absalom O
's O
men O
will O
not O
care O
. O

No O
, O
even O
if O
only O
half O
of O
us O
are O
killed O
, O
Absalom O
's O
men O
will O
not O
care O
. O

But O
you O
are O
worth O
10,000 O
of O
us O
! O

It O
is O
better O
for O
you O
to O
stay O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Then O
, O
if O
we O
need O
help O
, O
you O
can O
come O
to O
help O
us O
. O
'' O

The O
king O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
I O
will O
do O
what O
you O
think O
is O
best O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
king O
stood O
by O
the O
gate O
as O
the O
army O
went O
out O
in O
groups O
of O
100 O
and O
1000 O
. O

The O
king O
gave O
a O
command O
to O
Joab O
, O
Abishai O
, O
and O
Ittai O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Do O
this O
for O
me O
: O
Be O
gentle O
with O
young O
Absalom O
! O
'' O

Everyone O
heard O
the O
king O
's O
orders O
about O
Absalom O
to O
the O
captains O
. O

David O
's O
army O
went O
out O
into O
the O
field O
against O
Absalom O
's O
Israelites O
. O

They O
fought O
in O
the O
forest O
of O
Ephraim O
. O

David O
's O
army O
defeated O
the O
Israelites O
. O

It O
was O
a O
great O
defeat O
because O
20,000 O
men O
were O
killed O
that O
day O
. O

The O
battle O
spread O
throughout O
the O
country O
, O
but O
more O
men O
died O
in O
the O
forest O
than O
by O
the O
sword O
. O

It O
so O
happened O
that O
David O
's O
officers O
found O
Absalom O
. O

Absalom O
jumped O
on O
his O
mule O
and O
tried O
to O
escape O
, O
but O
the O
mule O
went O
under O
the O
branches O
of O
a O
large O
oak O
tree O
. O

The O
branches O
were O
thick O
, O
and O
Absalom O
's O
head O
got O
caught O
in O
the O
tree O
. O

His O
mule O
ran O
out O
from O
under O
him O
, O
so O
Absalom O
was O
left O
hanging O
above O
the O
ground O
. O

Someone O
saw O
this O
happen O
and O
told O
Joab O
, O
`` O
I O
saw O
Absalom O
hanging O
in O
an O
oak O
tree O
. O
'' O

Joab O
said O
to O
the O
man O
, O
`` O
Why O
did O
n't O
you O
kill O
him O
and O
let O
him O
fall O
to O
the O
ground O
? O

I O
would O
have O
given O
you O
a O
belt O
and O
ten O
pieces O
of O
silver O
! O
'' O

The O
man O
said O
to O
Joab O
, O
`` O
I O
would O
not O
try O
to O
hurt O
the O
king O
's O
son O
even O
if O
you O
gave O
me O
1000 O
pieces O
of O
silver O
. O

We O
heard O
the O
king O
's O
command O
to O
you O
, O
Abishai O
, O
and O
Ittai O
. O

The O
king O
said O
, O
' O
Be O
careful O
not O
to O
hurt O
young O
Absalom O
. O
' O

If O
I O
had O
killed O
Absalom O
, O
the O
king O
himself O
would O
find O
out O
, O
and O
you O
would O
punish O
me O
. O
'' O

Joab O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
will O
not O
waste O
my O
time O
here O
with O
you O
! O
'' O

Absalom O
was O
still O
alive O
and O
hanging O
in O
the O
oak O
tree O
. O

Joab O
took O
three O
sticks O
in O
his O
hand O
and O
hit O
him O
in O
the O
heart O
. O

Ten O
of O
Joab O
's O
young O
helpers O
gathered O
around O
Absalom O
and O
killed O
him O
. O

Joab O
blew O
the O
trumpet O
and O
called O
the O
people O
to O
stop O
chasing O
Israelites O
. O

Then O
Joab O
's O
men O
took O
Absalom O
's O
body O
and O
threw O
it O
into O
a O
large O
hole O
in O
the O
forest O
and O
covered O
it O
with O
stones O
. O

All O
the O
Israelites O
ran O
away O
and O
went O
home O
. O

While O
Absalom O
was O
alive O
he O
put O
up O
a O
memorial O
stone O
in O
King O
's O
Valley O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
have O
no O
son O
to O
keep O
my O
name O
alive O
. O
'' O

So O
he O
named O
that O
monument O
after O
himself O
. O

It O
is O
called O
`` O
Absalom O
's O
Monument O
'' O
even O
today O
. O

Ahimaaz O
the O
son O
of O
Zadok O
said O
to O
Joab O
, O
`` O
May O
I O
run O
and O
take O
the O
news O
to O
King O
David O
? O

I O
'll O
tell O
him O
the O
Lord O
has O
destroyed O
the O
enemy O
for O
him O
. O
'' O

Joab O
answered O
Ahimaaz O
, O
`` O
No O
, O
you O
will O
not O
carry O
the O
message O
today O
. O

You O
can O
do O
it O
some O
other O
time O
, O
but O
not O
today O
because O
it O
is O
the O
king O
's O
son O
who O
is O
dead O
. O
'' O

Then O
Joab O
said O
to O
a O
man O
from O
Ethiopia O
, O
`` O
Go O
, O
tell O
the O
king O
what O
you O
have O
seen O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
Ethiopian O
bowed O
to O
Joab O
and O
ran O
to O
tell O
David O
. O

But O
Ahimaaz O
son O
of O
Zadok O
begged O
Joab O
again O
, O
`` O
No O
matter O
what O
happens O
, O
please O
let O
me O
also O
run O
after O
the O
Ethiopian O
! O
'' O

Joab O
said O
, O
`` O
Son O
, O
why O
do O
you O
want O
to O
carry O
the O
news O
? O

You O
will O
not O
get O
any O
reward O
for O
the O
news O
you O
bring O
. O
'' O

Ahimaaz O
answered O
, O
`` O
No O
matter O
what O
happens O
, O
I O
will O
run O
to O
David O
. O
'' O

Joab O
said O
to O
Ahimaaz O
, O
`` O
All O
right O
, O
run O
to O
David O
! O
'' O

Then O
Ahimaaz O
ran O
through O
Jordan O
Valley O
and O
passed O
the O
Ethiopian O
. O

David O
was O
sitting O
between O
the O
two O
gates O
of O
the O
city O
. O

The O
watchman O
went O
up O
to O
the O
roof O
over O
the O
gate O
walls O
and O
saw O
a O
man O
running O
alone O
. O

The O
watchman O
shouted O
to O
tell O
King O
David O
. O

King O
David O
said O
, O
`` O
If O
the O
man O
is O
alone O
, O
he O
is O
bringing O
news O
. O
'' O

The O
man O
came O
closer O
and O
closer O
to O
the O
city O
. O

But O
then O
the O
watchman O
saw O
another O
man O
running O
. O

He O
called O
to O
the O
gatekeeper O
, O
`` O
Look O
! O

Another O
man O
is O
running O
alone O
. O
'' O

The O
king O
said O
, O
`` O
He O
is O
also O
bringing O
news O
. O
'' O

The O
watchman O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
think O
the O
first O
man O
runs O
like O
Ahimaaz O
son O
of O
Zadok O
. O
'' O

The O
king O
said O
, O
`` O
Ahimaaz O
is O
a O
good O
man O
, O
he O
must O
be O
bringing O
good O
news O
. O
'' O

Ahimaaz O
called O
to O
the O
king O
, O
`` O
All O
is O
well O
! O
'' O

Ahimaaz O
bowed O
with O
his O
face O
to O
the O
ground O
in O
front O
of O
the O
king O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Praise O
the O
Lord O
your O
God O
! O

The O
Lord O
has O
defeated O
the O
men O
who O
were O
against O
you O
, O
my O
lord O
and O
king O
. O
'' O

The O
king O
asked O
, O
`` O
Is O
young O
Absalom O
all O
right O
? O
'' O

Ahimaaz O
answered O
, O
`` O
When O
Joab O
sent O
me O
, O
I O
saw O
some O
great O
excitement O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
it O
was O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
king O
said O
, O
`` O
Step O
over O
here O
and O
wait O
. O
'' O

Ahimaaz O
went O
there O
and O
stood O
waiting O

The O
Ethiopian O
arrived O

and O
king O
. O

Today O
the O
Lord O

punished O
all O
those O

The O
king O
asked O
the O
Ethiopian O
, O
`` O
Is O

all O
right O
? O
'' O

The O

`` O
