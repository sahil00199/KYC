The O

are O
shooting O
our O

after O
they O
sign O
a O

with O
us O

In O
this O
situation O
Sharon B-PERSON
as O
a O
Prime O

will O
have O
the O
ability O
to O
calm O
down O
the O

give O
us O
the O
possibility O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
to O
check O
again O
with O
the O
Palestinians B-NORP
, O
do O
they O
mean O
peace O

It O
is O
inconceivable O
to O
think O
that O
in O
the O

time O
that O
the O
Palestinians B-NORP
go O
shooting O
us O
, O
we O
are O
talking O
to O
them O

Sharon B-PERSON
has O
told O

that O
he O
will O
not O
honor O
any O
deal O
made O
before O
the O
election O
if O
he O
wins O

and O
declared O
that O
the B-LAW
Oslo I-LAW
Accord I-LAW
is O
an O
agreement O
that O
no O
longer O
exists O
, O
giving O
the O
reason O
for O

that O
has O
claimed O
more B-CARDINAL

In O
an O
interview O
today B-DATE
with O
an O
Arabic B-LANGUAGE
language O
paper O
in O
Israel B-GPE
Sharon B-PERSON
has O
been O
detailing O
how O
he O
'd O
deal O
with O
the O
Palestinians B-NORP
. O

Sharon B-PERSON
says O
he O
envisions O
a O
series O
of O
phased O
agreements O
on O
issues O
like O
the O
status O
of O
Jerusalem B-GPE
and O
Palestinian B-NORP
refugees O
' O
right O
to O
return O
, O
but O
he O
says O
that O
progress O
would O
depend O
upon O
what O
he O
calls O
` O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
's O
behavior O
' O
. O

Prime O
Minister O
Ehud B-PERSON
Barak I-PERSON
says O
the O
right O
wing O
plans O
are O
unrealistic O
and O
will O
only O
lead O
to O
conflict O
. O

These O
are O
difficult O
problems O
and O
it O
is O
hard O
to O
solve O
them O
. O

The O
difference O
between O
Ariel B-PERSON
Sharon I-PERSON
and O
us O
is O
that O
we O
are O
dealing O
with O
them O
. O

When O
Ariel B-PERSON
Sharon I-PERSON
speaks O
about O
his O
version O
of O
peace O
, O
I O
say O
to O
you O
and O
to O
the O
general O
public O
, O
ask O
yourselves O
if O
this O
so O
- O
called O
peace O
has O
a O
partner O
on O
the O
other O
side O
, O
because O
if O
not O
, O
this O
is O
just O
a O
code O
word O
for O
war O
. O

Barak B-PERSON
's O
campaign O
has O
been O
presenting O
Sharon B-PERSON
as O
a O
danger O
to O
the O
country O
's O
security O
. O

Television O
ads O
have O
portrayed O
Sharon B-PERSON
as O
a O
dangerous O
extremist O
. O

Barak B-PERSON
's O
campaign O
has O
stressed O
the O
right O
wing O
leader O
's O
role O
as O
Minister O
of O
Defense O
during O
Israel B-GPE
's O
disastrous O
war O
in O
Lebanon B-GPE
in O
the B-DATE
1980s I-DATE
. O

Sharon B-PERSON
though O
, O
has O
been O
presenting O
himself O
as O
a O
moderate O
and O
the O
unifier O
for O
the O
Israeli B-NORP
people O
. O

Immediately O
after O
the O
elections O
I O
am O
going O
to O
call O
for O
a O
national O
unity O
government O
. O

So O
, O
I O
think O
, O
even O
that O
should O
bring O
them O
to O
behave O
a O
little O
bit O
nicer O
, O
and O
the O
one O
here O
that O
have O
broken O
all O
his O
pledges O
, O
I O
am O
sorry O
to O
say O
that O
it O
's O
only O
Mr. O
Barak B-PERSON
. O

According O
to O
a O
opinion O
poll O
most O
Israelis B-NORP
too O
blame O
their O
current O
Prime O
Minister O
for O
the O
ongoing O
crisis O
with O
the O
Palestinians B-NORP
. O

Some O
left O
- O
wingers O
in O
Israel B-GPE
are O
now O
quietly O
suggesting O
that O
it O
may O
be O
better O
for O
Barak B-PERSON
to O
step O
down O
before O
the O
election O
and O
allow O
the O
veteran O
Shimon B-PERSON
Peres I-PERSON
to O
stand O
in O
his O
place O
against O
Sharon B-PERSON
, O
but O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
the O
peace O
agreement O
, O
it O
may O
be O
difficult O
for O
any O
left O
winger O
to O
win O
over O
an O

What O
I O

those O

can O

secure O

. O

The O
BBC B-ORG
's O
James B-PERSON
Rogers I-PERSON
was O
in O
Brussels B-GPE
for O
today B-DATE
's O
announcement O
. O

He O
says O
there O
are O
two B-CARDINAL
main O
reasons O
for O
raising O
the O
Kursk B-PRODUCT
. O

Obviously O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
one O
is O
to O
recover O
the O
bodies O
that O
remain O
. O

There O
are O
still O
the O
bodies O
of O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
100 I-CARDINAL
sailors O
trapped O
in O
the O
vessel O
since O
it O
sank O
in O
the B-LOC
Barents I-LOC
Sea I-LOC
in O
August B-DATE
of I-DATE
last I-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

Secondly B-ORDINAL
, O
there O
is O
a O
longer O
- O
term O
threat O
and O
that O
's O
an O
environmental O
threat O
. O

The B-ORG
Kursk I-ORG
Foundation I-ORG
says O
that O
the O
nuclear O
reactors O
, O
there O
are O
two B-CARDINAL
on O
board O
, O
are O
safe O
for O
the O
time O
being O
but O
that O
the O
corrosive O
effects O
of O
seawater O
could O
in O
time O
lead O
to O
radioactive O
leaks O
into O
the O
ocean O
, O
which O
obviously O
could O
have O
devastating O
consequences O
on O
the O
fishery O
and O
the O
environment O
in O
general O
. O

That O
's O
the O
danger O
of O
leaving O
it O
down O
there O
. O

I O
would O
think O
there O
are O
risks O
of O
bringing O
it O
up O
as O
well O
. O

I O
mean O
this O
is O
a O
huge O
submarine O
. O

That O
's O
right O
. O

The O
size O
of O
these O
things O
is O
really O
very O
surprising O
. O

In O
fact O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
these O
Russian B-NORP
nuclear O
submarines O
is O
about O
the O
length O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
and I-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL
half I-CARDINAL
football O
fields O
. O

Now O
, O
it O
's O
lying O
in O
something O
over B-QUANTITY
300 I-QUANTITY
feet I-QUANTITY
of O
water O
, O
so O
if O
you O
can O
just O
visualize O
it O
being O
turned O
on O
its O
end O
, O
it O
would O
stick O
out O
of O
the O
sea O
about B-QUANTITY
200 I-QUANTITY
feet I-QUANTITY
. O

It O
is O
a O
huge O
submarine O
and O
nobody O
is O
pretending O
that O
this O
, O
if O
it O
goes O
ahead O
, O
is O
going O
to O
be O
an O
easy O
operation O
. O

There O
are O
any O
number O
of O
complications O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
which O
is O
that O
as O
part O
of O
the O
submarine O
is O
stuck O
in O
sand O
and O
clay O
on O
the O
seabed O
, O
so O
that O
's O
going O
to O
give O
resistance O
once O
they O
do O
try O
to O
lift O
it O
. O

Second B-ORDINAL
problem O
, O
as O
I O
have O
already O
mentioned O
, O
two B-CARDINAL
nuclear O
reactors O
on O
board O
. O

They O
are O
not O
going O
to O
be O
able O
to O
attach O
any O
lifting O
gear O
to O
any O
parts O
of O
the O
vessel O
nearby O
the O
nuclear O
reactors O
for O
fear O
of O
provoking O
an O
accident O
, O
so O
it O
is O
going O
to O
be O
extremely O
difficult O
. O

We O
had O
heard O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
months I-DATE
ago I-DATE
about O
some O
theories O
on O
how O
the O
submarine O
could O
be O
raised O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
was O
using O
balloons O
. O

Is O
that O
what O
the O
foundation O
itself O
plans O
on O
doing O
? O

That O
's O
not O
what O
they O
are O
proposing O
. O

Their O
rescue O
attempt O
involves O
three B-CARDINAL
vessels O
essentially O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
is O
a O
diving O
ship O
with O
two B-CARDINAL
diving O
bells O
. O

The O
second B-ORDINAL
is O
a O
huge O
platform O
with O
very O
large O
cranes O
on O
it O
, O
perhaps O
a O
platform O
of O
the O
type O
more O
usually O
used O
for O
oil O
and O
gas O
exploration O
, O
and O
a O
third B-ORDINAL
vessel O
involved O
is O
what O
the O
rescuers O
describe O
as O
a O
giant O
offshore O
barge O
and O
the O
plan O
is O
to O
lift O
the O
submarine O
off O
the O
seabed O
, O
attach O
it O
to O
the O
underneath O
of O
this O
barge O
and O
then O
take O
it O
to O
the O
Russian B-NORP
naval O
port O
of O
Mamansk B-GPE
. O

How O
much O
is O
it O
going O
to O
cost O
and O
where O
is O
the O
money O
coming O
from O
? O

Well O
, O
that O
's O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
problems O
that O
they O
are O
facing O
so O
far O
. O

The B-ORG
Kursk I-ORG
Foundation I-ORG
today B-DATE
were O
mentioning O
a O
figure O
of O
70 B-MONEY
million I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
. O

They O
have O
already O
presented O
their O
rescue O
plans O
to O
the B-ORG
European I-ORG
Union I-ORG
. O

They O
are O
hoping O
to O
get O
some O
funding O
from O
them O
, O
but O
they O
are O
going O
to O
be O
looking O
for O
worldwide O
funding O
because O
as O
they O
see O
it O
, O
the O
potential O
environmental O
consequences O
make O
this O
an O
international O
problem O
requiring O
an O
international O
solution O
. O

It O
might O
be O
worth O
reiterating O
that O
the O
Kursk B-PRODUCT
was O
such O
a O
prestigious O
submarine O
and O
really O
held O
a O
high O
position O
in O
terms O
of O
the B-ORG
Russian I-ORG
Navy I-ORG
, O
so O
this O
is O
something O
that O
Russians B-NORP
themselves O
are O
still O
dealing O
with O
even O
now O
. O

Very O
much O
so O
because O
obviously O
we O
have O
read O
a O
lot O
in O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
few I-DATE
years I-DATE
about O
how O
many O
parts O
of O
the O
Russian B-NORP
naval O
fleet O
is O
essentially O
rotting O
and O
is O
poorly O
maintained O
. O

The O
Kursk B-PRODUCT
certainly O
was O
n't O
part O
of O
that O
. O

It O
was O
only O
launched O
in O
the B-DATE
1990s I-DATE
and O
to O
a O
great O
extent O
was O
the O
pride O
of O
the O
Russian B-NORP
submarine O
fleet O
, O
so O
it O
was O
a O
great O
sense O
of O
shock O
when O
this O
went O
down O
. O

for O
men O
in O
the B-ORG
Russian I-ORG
Navy I-ORG
it O
was O
a O
great O
source O
of O
pride O
to O
serve O
in O
the O
submarine O
fleet O
, O
and O
then O
of O
course O
you O
have O
the O
feelings O
of O
the O
relatives O
to O
take O
into O
account O
. O

There O
are O
still O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
100 I-CARDINAL
bodies O
which O
have O
n't O
been O
recovered O
, O
so O
at O
least O
raising O
the O
vessel O
and O
being O
able O
to O
return O
the O
bodies O
of O
the O
dead O
sailors O
to O
their O
loved O
ones O
might O
go O
some O
small O
way O
towards O
redressing O
their O
grief O
. O

This O
is O

And O
so O
the B-ORG

is O
about O

that O

probably O

nearly O

In O

, O

are O
saying O
it O
ca O
n't O
happen O
here O

Philippe B-PERSON
Shatiney I-PERSON
is O
an O
editor O
of O
the O
French B-NORP
news O
weekly O
, O
Mahiyan B-ORG
. O

Philippe B-PERSON
, O
could O
it O
happen O
anywhere O
else O
. O

Oh O
, O
I O
really O
think O
not O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
because O
there O
are O
so O
few O
countries O
which O
are O
organized O
on O
the O
American B-NORP
model O
with O
, O
the O
powers O
of O
the O
state O
. O

So O
yes O
I O
think O
there O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
bemusement O
here O
in O
Europe B-GPE
about O
the O
difficulties O
that O
the O
Americans B-NORP
are O
having O
in O
choosing O
a O
President O
. O

I O
think O
there O
is O
also O
a O
lot O
of O
amusement O
though O
, O
there O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
finger O
pointing O
. O

It O
's O
always O
funny O
for O
the O
small O
guys O
to O
laugh O
when O
the O
giant O
trips O
over O
his O
feet O
. O

Well O
, O
let O
's O
look O
at O
the B-ORG
United I-ORG
States I-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
itself O
and O
our O
justice O
system O
, O
now O
is O
there O
an O
institution O
that O
is O
independent O
of O
politics O
that O
serves O
anything O
like O
the O
function O
that O
the B-ORG
US I-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
serves O
? O

Well O
, O
yes O
mostly O
European B-NORP
judicial O
systems O
do O
have O
a O
form O
of O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
. O

However O
, O
for O
example O
, O
in O
France B-GPE
the O
strict O
machinery O
of O
justice O
is O
separated O
from O
the O
constitutional O
court O
, O
which O
is O
a O
separate O
body O
, O
but O
yes O
there O
also O
the O
members O
are O
appointed O
by O
the O
President O
and O
therefore O
there O
also O
, O
the O
members O
of O
the B-ORG
Coseque I-ORG
Constitutionalle I-ORG
are O
somewhat O
open O
to O
criticism O
that O
the O
decisions O
are O
often O
more O
motivated O
by O
politics O
than O
they O
are O
by O
the O
law O
. O

However O
, O
I O
think O
that O
the O
image O
that O
we O
Europeans B-NORP
had O
, O
of O
the O
American B-NORP
system O
and O
especially O
of O
the B-ORG
US I-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
, O
was O
that O
those O
justices O
were O
above O
politics O
and O
, O
I O
think O
, O
that O
is O
also O
one O
of O
the O
bad O
surprises O
that O
this O
election O
is O
reserving O
to O
us O
Europeans B-NORP
is O
that O
finally O
your O
system O
is O
not O
as O
perfect O
as O
we O
were O
led O
to O
believe O
. O

I O
wonder O
in O
terms O
of O
this O
particular O
case O
, O
now O
this O
is O
certainly O
an O
extreme O
case O
in O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
with O
an O
unfathomably O
close O
election O
, O
How O
have O
other O
democracies O
dealt O
with O
effective O
ties O
, O
I O
mean O
could O
there O
for O
instance O
be O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
elections O
, O
you O
know O
where O
our O
type O
has O
gone O
to O
the O
courts O
, O
What O
happens O
to O
yours O
? O

Well O
, O
there O
have O
been O
cases O
in O
most O
recent O
elections O
in O
France B-GPE
where O
the B-ORG
Coseque I-ORG
Constitutionalle I-ORG
having O
been O
apprised O
of O
doubtful O
procedures O
or O
doubtful O
ways O
of O
counting O
the O
votes O
, O
have O
decided O
either O
to O
the O
election O
and O
have O
it O
done O
over O
again O
or O
to O
in O
fact O
change O
the O
winner O
. O

However O
, O
our O
electoral O
system O
is O
so O
much O
more O
simple O
in O
the O
sense O
that O
we O
have O
separate O
elections O
for O
the O
Presidency O
, O
for O
Parliament B-ORG
, O
for O
our O
mayors O
and O
therefore O
usually O
most O
French B-NORP
voters O
are O
faced O
with O
the O
difficulty O
of O
choosing O
a O
little O
paper O
ballotenne O
with O
a O
name O
on O
it O
and O
putting O
that O
in O
an O
envelop O
and O
then O
put O
that O
in O
the O
urn O
, O
so O
there O
is O
a O
much O
less O
chance O
of O
error O
, O
at O
least O
, O
in O
our O
French B-NORP
system O
. O

Hey O
, O
it O
is O
interesting O
there O
also O
, O
when O
we O
look O
at O
the O
idea O
of O
checks O
and O
balances O
in O
a O
non-partisan O
judiciary O
, O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
checks O
and O
balances O
, O
that O
actually O
originated O
in O
France B-GPE
. O

Yes O
indeed O
, O
it O
was O
a O
political O
idea O
put O
forward O
in O
the O
writings O
of O
the O
and O
another O
very O
famous O
french O
political O
observer O
Alexis B-PERSON
de I-PERSON
Tocqueville I-PERSON
who O
visited O
America B-GPE
and O
wrote O
an O
amazingly O
good O
book O
about O
American B-NORP
democracy O
, O
said O
exactly O
that O
, O
that O
America B-GPE
seemed O
to O
him O
to O
be O
the O
single O
country O
in O
the O
world O
who O
has O
managed O
to O
apply O
the O
separation O
of O
powers O
between O
the O
judiciary O
, O
the O
executive O
, O
and O
the O
legislative O
in O
a O
better O
way O
than O
any O
other O
country O
. O

So O
it O
's O
quite O
surprising O
for O
us O
Europeans B-NORP
to O
see O
that O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
would O
be O
involved O
, O
not O
really O
it O
seems O
to O
us O
in O
interpreting O
the O
law O
of O
the O
land O
or O
the O
constitution O
of O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
, O
but O
more O
in O
deciding O
the O
merits O
of O
a O
terribly O
political O
case O
. O

not O

they O

He O

that O

As O
for O

he O

these B-DATE

As O
The O
World B-ORG
's O
Maria B-PERSON
Soreas I-PERSON
reports O
from O
Caracas B-GPE
, O
the O
Venezuelan B-NORP
leader O
is O
pushing O
parliament O
to O
pass O
an O
enabling O
law O
that O
would O
grant O
him O
special O
powers O
. O

The O
enabling O
law O
will O
give O
President O
Chavez B-PERSON
the O
right O
to O
legislate O
by O
decree O
, O
which O
means O
he O
could O
rush O
dozens B-CARDINAL
of O
laws O
through O
parliament O
, O
not O
just O
economic O
and O
financial O
reforms O
, O
but O
also O
laws O
dealing O
with O

the O
creation O
of O
a O
new O
national O
police O
force O
. O

Responding O
to O
his O
critics O
, O
Chavez B-PERSON
recently O
defended O
his O
bid O
for O
power O
in O
a O
televized O
speech O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
the O
matter O
is O
exceptional O
. O

The O
enabling O
law O
is O
a O
constitutional O
measure O
within O
a O
normal O
economic O
social O
and O
political O
situation O
. O

What O
's O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
its O
purposes O
? O

Well O
, O
to O
accelerate O
solutions O
to O
our O
many O
problems O
. O

Although O
many O
members O
of O
Venezuela B-GPE

National B-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
are O
grumbling O
about O
the O
enabling O
law O
, O
Haber B-PERSON
Cuniket I-PERSON
professor O
of O
political O
science O

Desimum B-ORG
Boulevard I-ORG
University I-ORG
has O
no O
doubt O
they O
will O
give O
Chavez B-PERSON
, O
what O
he O
wants O
. O

Given O
that O
he O
has O
already O
controlled O
a O
majority O
of O
the B-ORG
National I-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
, O
it O
is O
very O
likely O
that O
the O
law O
will O
be O
passed O
and O
the O
general O
feeling O
is O
that O
there O
is O
a O
hurry O
in O
approving O
the O
legislation O
because O
the O
President O
seems O
to O
feel O
that O
he O
is O
running O
out O
of O
time O
with O
the O
popular O
support O
he O
has O
gotten O
ever O
since O
1998 B-DATE
. O

Cuniket B-PERSON
says O
, O
there O
has O
been O
a O
lot O
of O
public O
pressure O
on O
Chavez B-PERSON
to O
live O
up O
to O
his O
many O
campaign O
promises O
, O
such O
as O
distributing O
land O
and O
wealth O
more O
equally O
among O
Venezuelans B-NORP
. O

Deputies O
from O
the O
opposition O
are O
voicing O
their O
discontent O
. O

Beneta B-PERSON
Tikong I-PERSON
belongs O
to O
a O
party O
called O
Democratic B-ORG
Action I-ORG
. O

Tikong B-PERSON
says O
, O
her O
party O
is O
radically O
opposed O
to O
giving O
Chavez B-PERSON
the O
special O
powers O
. O

She O
says O
, O
the O
constitution O
can O
grant O
leaders O
such O
concentrated O
authority O
but O
it O
's O
only O
supposed O
to O
be O
used O
in O
cases O
of O
emergency O
. O

Granting O
Chavez B-PERSON
special O
powers O
also O
concerns O
Professor O
Kenike B-PERSON
, O
who O
says O
the O
President O
's O
deputies O
will O
contribute O
by O
giving O
him O
even O
more O
power O
. O

What O
is O
worrisome O
is O
that O
the O
President O
will O
be O
with O
extreme O
powers O
and O
he O
will O
be O
almost O
like O
a O
king O
, O
able O
to O
decide O
whatever O
he O
wants O
. O

He O
has O
been O
very O
hard O
against O
governors O
and O
mayors O
throughout O
the O
country O
and O
he O
seemed O
to O
prefer O
centralized O
kind O
of O
government O
than O
a O
decentralized O
one O
. O

Centralizing O
power O
under O
Chavez B-PERSON
seems O
risky O
to O
many O
. O

The B-GPE
United I-GPE

Nenad B-PERSON
, O
yesterday B-DATE
Mr. O
Pope B-PERSON
was O
sentenced O
despite O
an O
appeal O
for O
clemency O
by O
President O
Clinton B-PERSON
. O

Why O
has O
he O
taken O
this O
legal O
option O
? O

Does O
he O
have O
no O
confidence O
in O
the O
courts O
? O

Well O
, O
I O
would O
say O
it O
is O
pretty O
clear O
that O
he O
has O
no O
confidence O
in O
the O
Russian B-NORP
judicial O
system O
. O

He O
did O
have O
an O
option O
of O
appealing O
to O
the B-ORG
Russian I-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
but O
frankly O
this O
is O
a O
more O
likely O
and O
a O
faster O
way O
to O
freedom O
, O
I O
would O
say O
, O
because O
going O
through O
the O
appeals O
process O
is O
going O
to O
take O
months B-DATE
. O

He O
is O
known O
to O
be O
of O
ill O
health O
. O

He O
definitely O
wants O
to O
get O
out O
of O
the B-FAC
Lefortovo I-FAC
Prison I-FAC
and O
it O
would O
appear O
by O
the O
latest O
signs O
that O
it O
is O
going O
to O
be O
the O
right O
way O
. O

Going O
through O
an O
appeals O
court O
would O
take O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
and O
the O
outcome O
would O
be O
highly O
uncertain O
. O

So O
Nenad B-PERSON
, O
what O
's O
the O
timetable O
here O
? O

The O
request O
went O
to O
Putin B-PERSON
. O

Putin B-PERSON
in O
turn O
passes O
it O
on O
or O
has O
passed O
it O
on O
to O
the B-ORG
Presidential I-ORG
Pardons I-ORG
Commission I-ORG
. O

Is O
that O
correct O
? O

Yes O
, O
it O
has O
all O
happened O
actually O
very O
, O
very O
quickly O
. O

After O
the O
court O
cases O
dragged O
on O
for O
a B-DATE
couple I-DATE
of I-DATE
months I-DATE
and O
Pope B-PERSON
has O
been O
in O
jail O
since O
April B-DATE
the I-DATE
3rd I-DATE
, O
the O
ball O
really O
started O
rolling O
today B-DATE
. O

He O
wrote O
to O
Putin B-PERSON
. O

Putin B-PERSON
's O
office O
announced O
that O
the O
President O
has O
passed O
on O
the O
case O
to O
the B-ORG
Presidential I-ORG
Pardons I-ORG
Commission I-ORG
and O
today B-DATE
already O
we O
had O
the O
head O
of O
the O
commission O
appearing O
on O
Russian B-NORP
state O
television O
and O
saying O
that O
he O
will O
recommend O
a O
pardon O
to O
President O
Vladimir B-PERSON
Putin I-PERSON
. O

Now O
this O
commission O
is O
due O
to O
meet O
tomorrow B-DATE
but O
it O
is O
very O
difficult O
to O
envisage O
the O
commission O
not O
doing O
what O
the O
head O
of O
the O
commission O
has O
said O
it O
will O
do O
. O

The B-ORG
Presidential I-ORG
Pardons I-ORG
Commission I-ORG
in O
Russia B-GPE
, O
is O
that O
a O
relatively O
new O
institution O
? O

I O
would O
assume O
this O
being O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
Cold B-EVENT
War I-EVENT
spy O
case O
in O
40 B-DATE
years I-DATE
in O
Russia B-GPE
that O
a O
certain O
number O
of O
institutions O
that O
are O
being O
involved O
, O
perhaps O
are O
being O
involved O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

Well O
, O
there O
are O
really O
no O
precedents O
here O
Tony B-PERSON
because O
, O
as O
you O
mentioned O
, O
the O
last O
trial O
of O
an O
alleged O
foreign O
spy O
, O
was O
actually O
the O
trial O
of O
Gary B-PERSON
Powers I-PERSON
way O
back O
in O
1961 B-DATE
, O
and O
Gary B-PERSON
Powers I-PERSON
was O
shot O
down O
over O
Russia B-GPE
, O
so O
his O
guilt O
was O
fairly O
firmly O
established O
and O
ever O
since O
then O
any O
suspected O
spies O
were O
usually O
either O
sort O
of O
simply O
kicked O
out O
of O
the O
country O
, O
expelled O
, O
or O
they O
were O
arrested O
and O
then O
swapped O
for O
Russian B-NORP
spies O
arrested O
in O
Western O
countries O
. O

The O
speed O
with O
which O
Mr. O
Putin B-PERSON
seems O
to O
have O
responded O
to O
events O
here O
, O
is O
that O
any O
indication O
that O
perhaps O
he O
has O
found O
the O
whole O
incident O
embarrassing O
? O

It O
may O
be O
that O
this O
is O
simply O
a O
case O
which O
is O
not O
important O
on O
a O
wider O
scale O
for O
Putin B-PERSON
, O
that O
he O
has O
shown O
what O
he O
needed O
to O
show O
to O
the O
Russian B-NORP
public O
, O
which O
is O
that O
the O
system O
is O
there O
, O
the O
system O
is O
going O
strong O
, O
it O
is O
taking O
care O
of O
the O
state O
secrets O
and O
, O
you O
know O
, O
the O
police O
is O
doing O
its O
job O
, O
the B-ORG
Federal I-ORG
Security I-ORG
Service I-ORG
is O
doing O
its O
job O
, O
but O
now O
that O
that O
has O
been O
done O
with O
, O
now O
that O
we O
have O
had O
a O
conviction O
in O
court O
he O
does O
not O
see O
the O
necessity O
of O
pursuing O
the O
whole O
thing O
any O
further O
, O
and O
in O
order O
to O
appear O
magnanimous O
in O
the O
eyes O
of O
the O
Western B-NORP
public O
opinion O
, O
certainly O

, O
I O
guess O
that O
those O
are O
the O
reasons O
which O
prompted O
him O
to O
move O
in O
the O
direction O
he O
has O
moved O
. O

And O
one O
would O
assume O
that O
the O
effort O
is O
also O
being O
made O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
US B-GPE
- O
Russian O
relations O
are O
n't O
seriously O
affected O
by O
this O
? O

Yes O
, O
because O
there O
have O
been O
a O
number O
of O
calls O
in O
the O
American B-NORP
Congress B-ORG
, O
for O
example O
, O
to O
introduce O
economic O
sanctions O
against O
Russia B-GPE
for O
this O
. O

The O
administration O
itself O
has O
not O
shown O
any O
willingness O
to O
get O
involved O
too O
deeply O
and O
certainly O
has O
not O
shown O
any O
willingness O
to O
introduce O
sanctions O
against O
Russia B-GPE
, O
but O
we O
do O
know O
that O
President O
Clinton B-PERSON
has O
spoken O
to O
Vladimir B-PERSON
Putin I-PERSON
about O
this O
. O

We O
do O
know O
that O
the O
Secretary O
of O
State B-ORG
Madeleine B-PERSON
Albright I-PERSON
has O
raised O
the O
issue O
a O
number O
of O
times O
, O
so O
this O
will O
certainly O
help O
smooth O
the O
way O
towards O
the O
future O
of O
American B-NORP
administration O
, O
as O
and O
when O
there O

accusation O

the O

At B-CARDINAL

four I-CARDINAL
more O

were O
killed O

Gaza B-GPE

both O

The O
World B-WORK_OF_ART

Richard B-PERSON
Myron I-PERSON

Tel B-GPE

now O
. O

Richard B-PERSON
, O
describe O
what O
's O
been O
happening O
today B-DATE
. O

Well O
, O
we O
have O
had O
unfortunately O
what O
we O
term O
a O
busy O
day O
here O
today B-DATE
, O
including O
a O
suicide O
bombing O
in O
a O
Jewish B-NORP
settlement O
in O
the O
northern O
part O
of O
the B-GPE
West I-GPE
Bank I-GPE
. O

What O
apparently O
happened O
was O
that O
a O
Palestinian B-NORP
went O
in O
to O
a O
roadside O
restaurant O
and O
he O
blew O
himself O
up O
critically O
injuring O
a O
number O
of O
people O
. O

Elsewhere O
, O
in O
the B-GPE
West I-GPE
Bank I-GPE
and O
Gaza B-GPE
there O
have O
been O
deaths O
of O
Palestinians B-NORP
. O

One B-CARDINAL
Palestinian B-NORP
was O
apparently O
shot O
, O
so O
the B-ORG
Israeli I-ORG
Army I-ORG
claims O
, O
by O
Palestinian B-NORP
fire O
. O

He O
was O
working O
in O
the O
greenhouse O
in O
a O
Jewish B-NORP
settlement O
. O

Elsewhere O
, O
a O
number O
of O
other O
Palestinians B-NORP
were O
killed O
in O
clashes O
with O
Israeli B-NORP
forces O
. O

So O
it O
has O
been O
an B-DATE
unfortunately I-DATE
, I-DATE
as I-DATE
I I-DATE
say I-DATE
, I-DATE
busy I-DATE
and I-DATE
bloody I-DATE
day I-DATE
here O
, O
and O
this O
was O
happening O
on O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
Friday I-DATE
in I-DATE
Ramadan I-DATE
, O
which O
is O
a B-DATE
very I-DATE
important I-DATE
day I-DATE
for O
Muslim B-NORP
prayer O
. O

Was O
there O
any O
trouble O
today B-DATE
around O
the O
holy O
sites O
in O
Jerusalem B-GPE
? O

The O
trouble O
was O
very O
limited O
. O

There O
were O
some O
scuffles O
, O
there O
was O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
stone O
throwing O
and O
at O
one O
point O
the B-FAC
Western I-FAC
War I-FAC
Plaza I-FAC
, O
the O
area O
that O
stands O
in O
front O
of O
the O
Jewish B-NORP
holy O
site O
of O
the B-FAC
West I-FAC
Moor I-FAC
was O
cleared O
, O
it O
is O
adjacent O
to O
the O
Muslim B-NORP
site O
of O
the B-FAC
Haram I-FAC
al I-FAC
- I-FAC
Sharif I-FAC
or O
Temple B-FAC
Mount I-FAC
. O

This O
was O
cleared O
because O
of O
some O
stone O
throwing O
. O

It O
was O
fairly O
limited O
. O

The O
Israeli B-NORP
police O
and O
security O
forces O
have O
acted O
in O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
few I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
to O
try O
and O
ensure O
that O
they O
have O
as O
much O
control O
as O
possible O
drafting O
in O
3000 B-CARDINAL
policemen O
and O
security O
officials O
, O
also O
not O
allowing O
Palestinians B-NORP
in O
from O
the B-GPE
West I-GPE
Bank I-GPE
. O

They O
must O
be O
45 B-DATE
years I-DATE
and O
over O
to O
enter O
the B-GPE
Old I-GPE
City I-GPE
, O
if O
they O
are O
from O
Jerusalem B-GPE
, O
35 B-DATE
years I-DATE
and O
older O
. O

So O
it O
has O
limited O
the O
numbers O
inside O
, O
and O
therefore O
the O
amount O
of O
trouble O
, O
but O
there O
was O
some O
scuffle O
and O
it O
was O
expected O
in O
a O
way O
that O
there O
would O
be O
certainly O
tension O
and O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
trouble O
there O
today B-DATE
. O

Of O
course O
, O
all O
of O
this O
is O
happening O
against O
the O
backdrop O
of O
peace O
talks O
in O
Washington B-GPE
, O
which O
are O
in O
their B-DATE
fourth I-DATE
day I-DATE
today B-DATE
. O

What O
about O
people O
on O
the O
ground O
there O
where O
you O
are O
? O

Are O
they O
hopeful O
something O
might O
come O
out O
of O
this O
? O

Are O
they O
even O
paying O
heed O
to O
what O
is O
happening O
in O
Washington B-GPE
? O

I O
think O
people O
are O
paying O
heed O
because O
I O
think O
people O
realize O
that O
there O
is O
a O
sense O
that O
it O
could O
happen O
. O

There O
is O
a O
great O
sense O
of O
urgency O
here O
. O

They O
are O
really O
berserk O
. O

The O
security O
situation O
has O
deteriorated O
to O
a O
very O
bad O
level O
and O
could O
deteriorate O
yet O
further O
unless O
there O
is O
some O
kind O
of O
agreement O
. O

Having O
said O
that O
, O
I O
think O
there O
is O
really O
a O
great O
sense O
of O
pessimism O
amongst O
both O
sides O
. O

Talking O
of O
the O
Israeli B-NORP
side O
first O
of O
all O
, O
the O
middle O
ground O
in O
Israel B-GPE
, O
I O
think O
, O
feels O
very O
disappointed O
and O
to O
some O
extent O
disillusioned O
with O
the O
Palestinians B-NORP
and O
does O
n't O
feel O
that O
there O
is O
much O
of O
a O
possibility O
for O
an O
honest O
deal O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
trust O
the O
other O
side O
. O

I O
think O
they O
may O
want O
the O
deal O
to O
happen O
, O
but O
they O
do O
n't O
trust O
the O
intentions O
of O
the O
other O
side O
. O

The O
Palestinians B-NORP
for O
their O
part O
, O
I O
think O
, O
are O
deeply O
pessimistic O
. O

They O
have O
mistrusted O
the O
Israelis B-NORP
throughout O
this O
process O
and O
have O
viewed O
the O
process O
as O
one O
, O
which O
has O
gradually O
robbed O
them O
of O
their O
rights O
, O
and O
I O
think O
they O
see O
any O
agreement O
as O
a O
sellout O
. O

So O
basically O
neither O
side O
enters O
this O
with O
a O
great O
sense O
of O
hope O
, O
but O
I O
think O
both O
sides O
ultimately O
recognize O
that O
in O
a O
way O
if O
they O
are O
to O
have O
some O
kind O
of O
agreement O
or O
if O
they O
are O
to O
live O
with O
each O
other O
, O
they O
have O
either O
got O
to O
do O
it O
by O
negotiation O
or O
by O
blood O
and O
I O
think O
obviously O
most O
people O
would O
rather O
live O
with O
each O
other O
in O
peace O
, O
the O
peace O
which O
can O
be O
found O
through O
negotiations O
. O

It O
sounds O
then O
as O
if O
there O
is O
not O
necessarily O
a O
big O
willingness O
at O
this O
point O
to O
compromise O
any O
more O
than O
there O
was O
earlier O
, O
especially O
as O
President O
Clinton B-PERSON
comes O
in O
to O
speak O
with O
the O
negotiators O
tomorrow B-DATE
. O

Well O
, O
I O
am O
speaking O
of O
the O
people O
, O
amongst O
the O
leadership O
I O
think O
there O
may O
be O
a O
tendency O
to O
compromise O
. O

We O
have O
heard O
reports O
that O
the O
Israelis B-NORP
are O
willing O
, O
or O
at O
least O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
sides O
are O
close O
to O
a O
deal O
on O
Jerusalem B-GPE
i.e. O
that O
the O
Palestinians O
would O
get O
sovereignty O
over O
East B-GPE
Jerusalem I-GPE
, O
which O
is O
what O
they O
have O
claimed O
is O
justly O
theirs O
and O
what O
they O
want O
, O
and O
there O
is O
also O
a O
talk O
of O
borders O
and O
the O
refugees O
being O
discussed O
. O

There O
is O
a O
great O
sense O
of O
urgency O
, O
I O
think O
that O
a O
deal O
should O
be O
reached O
. O

The O
Israelis B-NORP
are O
particularly O
keen O
with O
the O
forthcoming O
election O
. O

I O
think O
, O
this O
Israeli B-NORP
government O
wants O
to O
deliver O
to O
the O
people O
a O
deal O
so O
that O
has O
something O
to O
get O
the O
electorate O
with O
. O

The O
Palestinians B-NORP
, O
some O
could O
argue O
, O
are O
in O
a O
better O
negotiating O
position O
, O
but O
equally O
then O
if O
they O
are O
faced O
with O
the O
prospect O
of O
the O
Prime O
Ministership O
of O
the O
right O
wing O
leader O
Ariel B-PERSON
Sharon I-PERSON
, O
they O
may O
judge O
that O
this O
is O
the O
best O
time O
to O
do O
a O
deal O
equally O
. O

The O

The O

the O
3 B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
Vietnamese B-NORP

Let O

not O
by O
forgetting O

he O

actually O

the O

probably O
too O

attention O

what O
that O

that O

even O
the O
clouds O

could O

the O
two B-CARDINAL
main O
controversies O
following O
the O

what O
caused O
it O
and O
what O
to O
do O
with O
the O
submarine O
and O
the O
bodies O
of O
the O
crew O

President O
Vladimir B-PERSON

promised O

the O
bodies O

recovered O
and O
Sir O
Gay B-PERSON
Evanell I-PERSON
, O
the O
head O
of O
the O
powerful O
Security B-ORG
Council I-ORG
says O
the O
promise O
still O
stands O
. O

We O
are O
going O
to O
see O
through O
this O
unique O
operation O
. O

No O
one O
has O
ever O
done O
anything O
like O
it O
before O
, O
and O
we O
do O
realize O
that O
it O
is O
very O
risky O
, O
both O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
physical O
dangers O
for O
the O
divers O
, O
and O
to O
the O
psychological O
stress O
depending O
on O
what O
we O
find O
there O
. O

But O
not O
everyone O
thinks O
recovering O
the O
bodies O
is O
a O
good O
idea O
. O

Naval O
Captain O
Biltera B-PERSON
Pedro I-PERSON
says O
it O
's O
against O
tradition O
that O
sailors O
have O
respected O
for O
centuries B-DATE
and O
could O
also O
cause O
great O
grief O
. O

He O
says O
, O
`` O
just O
imagine O
the O
tragedy O
of O
those O
families O
when O
some O
bodies O
are O
retrieved O
and O
others O
are O
n't O
. O
'' O

Russia B-GPE
had O
a O
similar O
case O
way O
back O
in O
1970s O
says O
Pedro B-PERSON
, O
when O
just B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
body O
was O
recovered O
. O

The O
Fleet O
Commander O
then O
decided O
to O
have O
even O
that O
one B-CARDINAL
body O
handed O
back O
to O
the O
sea O
where O
the O
submarine O
went O
down O
says O
Pedro B-PERSON
. O

And O
it O
's O
not O
just O
about O
the O
tradition O
in O
the O
past O
, O
but O
the O
future O
as O
well O
argues O
Alexe B-PERSON
Budnev I-PERSON
from O
the B-ORG
Veterans I-ORG
Club I-ORG
of O
the B-ORG
Russian I-ORG
Fleet I-ORG
. O

The O
cost O
of O
this O
operation O
will O
be O
huge O
. O

I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
much O
better O
to O
invest O
the O
sum O
in O
improving O
the O
rescue O
capabilities O
of O
the O
Russian B-NORP
fleet O
, O
so O
we O
can O
save O
lives O
in O
the O
future O
. O

And O
while O
this O
controversy O
is O
going O
on O
, O
so O
does O
the O
government O
investigation O
into O
the O
causes O
of O
the O
disaster O
. O

Former O
submarine O
captain O
Ureg B-PERSON
Gladkovich I-PERSON
says O
that O
he O
is O
confident O
the O
government O
commission O
will O
do O
a O
good O
job O
. O

The O
authorities O
need O
to O
know O
the O
truth O
in O
order O
to O
make O
whatever O
changes O
are O
necessary O
for O
the O
future O
safety O
of O
the O
submarine O
fleet O
says O
Gladkovich B-PERSON
, O
but O
whether O
those O
findings O
will O
ever O
reach O
the O
public O
is O
another O
matter O
. O

Just O
look O
back O
at O
the O
way O
they O
fudged O
and O
lied O
their O
way O
through O
the O
rescue O
operation O
. O

They O
never O
gave O
us O
the O
full O
truth O
. O

That O
gives O
us O
reason O
to O
doubt O
their O
good O
intentions O
to O
tell O
us O
the O
truth O
this O
time O
. O

It O
all O
depends O
on O
the O
good O
will O
of O
the O
military O
and O
the O
government O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
Russia B-GPE
does O
n't O
have O
a O
political O
mechanism O
that O
would O
make O
such O
an O
investigation O
open O
to O
the O
public O
. O

affairs O
analyst O
with O
the O
well O
- O
respected O
Russian B-NORP
news O
magazine O
Itogi B-ORG
, O
Alexander B-PERSON
Gulls I-PERSON
, O
says O
the O
Commission B-ORG
's O
work O
is O
just O
a O
smoke O
screen O
. O

He O
says O
the O
cause O
of O
the O
Kursk B-PRODUCT
tragedy O
is O
known O
to O
those O
in O
charge O
. O

Our O
Navy B-ORG
commanders O
they O
know O
pretty O
well O
and O
all O
that O
's O
going O
on O
now O
points O
that O
these O
people O
want O
to O
hide O
the O
real O
thing O
that O
had O
happened O
onboard O
of O
Kursk B-PRODUCT
. O

But O
what O
did O
cause O
the O
Kursk B-PRODUCT
tragedy O
? O

There O
are O
three B-CARDINAL
main O
theories O
. O

Firstly O
, O
that O
a O
torpedo O
missile O
misfired O
while O
still O
in O
the O
tube O
causing O
a O
massive O
explosion O
in O
the O
armory O
, O
secondly O
, O
that O
the O
sub O
hit O
a O
mine O
leftover O
from O
World B-EVENT
War I-EVENT
II I-EVENT
, O
and O
thirdly O
, O
a O
collision O
with O
another O
vessel O
. O

Former O
Captain O
Ureg B-PERSON
Gladkovich I-PERSON
says O
that O
his O
experience O
leads O
into O
believing O
another O
theory O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
the O
captain O
over O
the O
Kursk B-PRODUCT
took O
a O
sudden O
and O
drastic O
maneuver O
to O
avoid O
colliding O
with O
another O
vessel O
. O

The O
waters O
were O
shallow O
for O
such O
a O
huge O
submarine O
and O
the O
sub O
maneuver O
led O
to O
the O
front O
part O
of O
the O
sub O
hitting O
the O
seabed O
with O
great O
speed O
. O

The O
sheer O
force O
led O
to O
the O
explosion O
of O
the O
armaments O
that O
are O
stored O
in O
the O
front O
compartment O
. O

The O
whole O
front O
part O
of O
the O
submarine O
was O
probably O
flooded O
within O
seconds B-TIME
killing O
most O
of O
the O
crew O
says O
Gladkovich B-PERSON
. O

The O
ones O
in O
the O
back O
compartments O
could O
have O
survived O
for O
a O
while O
, O
he O
says O
, O
but O
not O
more O
than O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
hours I-TIME
, O
as O
the O
sea O
continued O
to O
flood O
the O
whole O
boat O
after O
it O
cracked O
up O
. O

But O
while O
the O
theory O
sounds O
very O
plausible O
, O
there O
is O
no O
evidence O
as O
yet O
to O
make O
it O
anything O
more O
than O
educated O
guess O
work O
. O

According O
to O
military O
analyst O
, O
Alexander B-PERSON
Gulls I-PERSON
, O
that O
is O
the O
way O
things O
will O
remain O
. O

The O
huge O
money O
that O
were O
promised O
to O
families O
avail O
, O
receive O
ten B-CARDINAL
times O
more O
than O
families O
of O
soldiers O
who O
were O
killed O
in O
Chechnya B-GPE
. O

For O
me O
, O
it O
's O
rather O
cynical O
attempt O
to O
shut O
them O
up O
. O

With O
so O
many O
secrets O
linked O
to O
the O
Kursk B-PRODUCT
, O
Russia B-GPE
's O
most O
advanced O
nuclear O
submarine O
, O
the O
full O
truth O
may O
never O
emerge O
, O
even O
if O
the O
bodies O
and O
the O
boat O
eventually O
do O
. O

nationalism O
, O
which O
provokes O
hatred O
and O
xenophobia O
. O

He O
is O
not O
nationalist O
in O
terms O
of O
ideology O
, O
but O
in O
terms O
of O
feeling O
. O

He O
likes O
his O
nation O
and O
he O
tries O
to O
fight O
for O
the O
interest O
of O
his O
nation O
, O
but O
early O
in O
the B-EVENT
Bosnian I-EVENT
war I-EVENT
, O
Kostunica B-PERSON
did O
go O
to O
the O
Bosnian B-NORP
- I-NORP
Serb I-NORP
stronghold O
of O
Parle B-GPE
and O
met O
several O
times O
with O
Vladaven B-PERSON
Karadzic I-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
later O
indicted O
for O
war O
crimes O
. O

Yes O
, O
but O
he O
never O
supported O
Karadzic B-PERSON
's O
bombing O
of O
Sarajevo B-GPE
, O
for O
instance O
. O

Bill B-PERSON
Monroe I-PERSON
, O
deputy O
leader O
of O
Kostunica B-PERSON
's O
political O
party O
, O
says O
Kostunica B-PERSON
tried O
to O
dissuade O
Karadzic B-PERSON
from O
ethnic O
cleansing O
. O

Yes O
, O
he O
was O
always O
in O
favor O
of O
negotiating O
, O
of O
stopping O
the O
violence O
. O

He O
never O
sided O
with O
those O
extreme O
and O
deplorable O
things O
that O
were O
done O
by O
some O
of O
the B-NORP
Bosnian I-NORP
Serbs I-NORP
. O

To O
rebuild O
Yugoslavia B-GPE
, O
Kostunica B-PERSON
will O
need O
the O
help O
of O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
in O
securing O
international O
loans O
. O

That O
could O
require O
some O
skill O
, O
political O
tap O
dancing O
. O

Kostunica B-PERSON
has O
criticized O
the O
present O
American B-NORP
leadership O
, O
for O
among O
other O
things O
, O
leading O
the O
Nato B-ORG
air O
strikes O
against O
his O
country O
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
but O
last B-DATE
week I-DATE
when O
he O
received O
the O
US B-GPE
Special O
Envoy O
to O
the O
Balkans B-LOC
, O
Kostunica B-PERSON
made O
a O
favorable O
impression O
while O
lots O
of O
peddling O
his O
grievances O
with O
Washington B-GPE
. O

Bulatovic B-PERSON
says O
Kostunica B-PERSON
was O
able O
to O
pull O
off O
the O
balancing O
act O
because O
he O
is O
not O
really O
anti-American B-NORP
. O

One O
should O
distinguish O
between O
his O
attitude O
towards O
present O
or O
rather O
outgoing O
American B-NORP
administration O
meaning O
Clinton B-PERSON
, O
Madeleine B-PERSON
Albright I-PERSON
, O
Holbrooke B-PERSON
. O

He O
is O
highly O
critical O
of O
them O
and O
their O
attitude O
, O
but O
he O
always O
put O
forward O
reasons O
for O
his O
attitude O
. O

So O
far O
, O
says O
Belgrade B-GPE
journalist O
Dragoli B-PERSON
Bazarcowich I-PERSON
, O
Kostunica B-PERSON
is O
off O
to O
a O
good O
start O
. O

He O
has O
n't O
made O
a O
single O
mistake O
so O
far O
. O

Okay O
, O
when O
he O
met O
President O
Clinton B-PERSON
's O
special O
emissary O
O'Brian B-PERSON
the O
buttons O
on O
his O
shirt O
were O
not O
done O
properly O
. O

That O
's O
the O
only O
thing O
I O
have O
noticed O
so O
far O
. O

The O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
he O
badly O
needs O
to O
watch O
out O
for O
right O
now O
, O
is O
the O
ambitious O
in O
the O
ranks O
of O
his O
own O
Democratic B-ORG
Alliance I-ORG
. O

If O
he O
does O
n't O
keep O
them O
in O
check O
, O
his O
clean O
reputation O
could O
be O
quickly O
tarnished O
, O
but O
as O
for O
now O
the O
honeymoon O
is O
still O
on O
. O

This O
week O
Kostunica B-PERSON
's O
main O
task O
is O
try O
and O
consolidate O
power O
by O
forming O
the O
new O
government O
. O

Today B-DATE
's O
negotiations O
with O
parliamentary O
parties O
have O
brought O
him O
a O
step O
closer O
but O
not O
yet O
there O
. O

Cleaning O
up O
the O
mess O
of O
the B-DATE
13 I-DATE
years I-DATE
of O
Milosevic B-PERSON
's O
dictatorship O
is O
a O
gargantuan O
task O
, O
which O
is O
just O
beginning O
, O
not O
only O
for O
Vojislav B-PERSON
Kostunica I-PERSON
but O
the O
whole O
country O
. O

For O
The B-ORG
World I-ORG
, O
this O
is O
Nenad B-PERSON
Shebek I-PERSON
in O
Belgrade B-GPE
. O

President O

is O
scheduled O
to O
meet O
with O
Israeli B-NORP

negotiators O
tomorrow B-DATE
to O
assess O
how O
the O
peace O

are O
going O
. O

The B-ORG

expected O
to O
join O

morning B-TIME

Spokesman O
P.J. B-PERSON
Crowley I-PERSON
said O
the O
administration O
has O
n't O
ruled O
out O
the O
possibility O
of O
sending O
a O
senior O
US B-GPE
official O
to O
the B-LOC
Mid I-LOC
East I-LOC
to O
try O
to O
arrange O
a O
meeting O
of O
Israeli B-NORP
and O
Palestinian B-NORP
leaders O
. O

Not O
a O
whole O
lot O
happens O
in O
Dornoch B-GPE
, O
but O
tomorrow B-DATE
the O
small O
Scottish B-NORP
town O
will O
be O
the O
center O
of O
the O
universe O
. O

At O
least O
that O
's O
the O
conclusion O
you O
might O
reach O
from O
seeing O
the O
hundreds B-CARDINAL
of O
journalists O
and O
photographers O
camped O
out O
there O
. O

They O
are O
all O
vying O
for O
the O
story O
of O
the B-DATE
millennium I-DATE
, O
which O
is O
, O
as O
if O
you O
did O
n't O
know O
, O
tomorrow B-DATE
's O
wedding O
of O
singer O
Madonna B-PERSON
and O
filmmaker O
Guy B-PERSON
Ritchie I-PERSON
. O

This O
amazing O
, O
thrilling O
and O
fantastic O
story O
began O
today B-DATE
with O
the O
christening O
of O
the O
couple O

Reporter O
Garith B-PERSON
McClain I-PERSON
is O
covering O
the O
story O
for O
the O
London B-GPE
based O
Guardian B-ORG
newspaper O
. O

Now O
Garith B-PERSON
it O
sounds O
like O
the O
Scottish B-NORP
media O
have O
all O
gone O
mad O
. O

Why O
this O
interest O
in O
an O
American B-NORP
pop O
star O
? O

We O
are O
surprised O
that O
we O
have O
such O
an O
American B-NORP
pop O
star O
in O
Scotland B-GPE
itself O
, O
never O
mind O
up O
in O
Dornoch B-GPE
which O
is O
near O
Inverness B-GPE
, O
which O
is O
the O
back O
of O
beyond O
even O
to O
most O
Scottish B-NORP
people O
. O

I O
think O
it O
's O
like O
the O
wilds O
of O
Washington B-GPE
State I-GPE
. O

I O
think O
it O
's O
the O
best O
comparison O
I O
can O
make O
. O

So O
you O
are O
saying O
there O
are O
n't O
Hollywood B-GPE
stars O
and O
starlets O
there O
, O
there O
is O
not O
a O
whole O
lot O
going O
on O
. O

Just O
the O
howling O
wind O
and O
the O
pouring O
rain O
otherwise O
. O

And O
a O
lot O
of O
fog O
I O
guess O
now O
. O

Apparently O
, O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
hard O
to O
get O
a O
good O
camera O
angle O
for O
the O
wedding O
. O

Apparently O
so O
, O
yes O
, O
and O
the O
guests O
have O
been O
warned O
not O
to O
keep O
cameras O
in O
their O
kilts O
. O

Cameras O
in O
their O
kilts O
? O

Yes O
. O

If O
one O
would O
so O
desire O
. O

Well O
apparently O
, O
photo O
lens O
in O
your O
pocket O
or O
are O
you O
just O
pleased O
to O
see O
me O
. O

Yes O
, O
guests O
have O
been O
warned O
not O
to O
bring O
in O
cameras O
in O
their O
kilts O
and O
people O
are O
having O
their O
kilts O
examined O
and O
looked O
up O
, O
which O
if O
you O
know O
anything O
about O
Scotland B-GPE
and O
Scottish B-NORP
men O
are O
n't O
suppose O
to O
wear O
anything O
under O
their O
kilts O
. O

Yeah O
. O

A O
bit O
of O
an O
eyeful O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
can O
. O

He O
's O
got O
a O
camera O
there O
! O

That O
's O
an O
interesting O
little O
anecdote O
, O
is O
n't O
it O
? O

Well O
, O
when O
this O
sort O
of O
thing O
happens O
in O
a O
small O
community O
and O
I O
guess O
that O
's O
a O
under O
statement O
in O
this O
case O
, O
whether O
or O
not O
it O
all O
succeeds O
depends O
on O
how O
well O
some O
of O
the O
local O
people O
can O
keep O
secrets O
. O

Are O
people O
kind O
of O
, O
you O
know O
, O
in O
the O
fold O
on O
this O
, O
or O
are O
there O
things O
being O
leaked O
around O
to O
press O
here O
and O
there O
? O

Well O
Skibo B-FAC
Castle I-FAC
, O
where O
the O
wedding O
is O
being O
held O
, O
is O
very O
discrete O
. O

There O
have O
been O
a O
lot O
of O
celebrity O
weddings O
there O
but O
none O
as O
big O
as O
this O
admittedly O
. O

But O
within O
the O
town O
there O
was O
a O
piano O
being O
rented O
out O
from O
a O
piano O
shop O
in O
Aberdeen B-GPE
, O
which O
is O
sort O
of O
reasonably O
nearby O
and O
it O
was O
leaked O
that O
this O
was O
the O
piano O
that O
someone O
was O
going O
to O
play O
at O
the O
wedding O
. O

Reportedly O
, O
it O
was O
Elton B-PERSON
John I-PERSON
who O
was O
going O
to O
play O
a O
song O
for O
Guy B-PERSON
and O
the O
shop O
was O
inundated O
when O
this O
was O
leaked O
and O
people O
just O
wanting O
to O
touch O
the O
piano O
that O
was O
going O
to O
be O
in O
the O
same O
room O
as O
Madonna B-PERSON
and O
Guy B-PERSON
Ritchie I-PERSON
. O

I O
imagine O
the O
locals O
could O
be O
kind O
of O
swooning O
for O
quite O
a O
while O
because O
Sting B-PERSON
, O
who O
I O
guess O
might O
be O
singing O
at O
the O
wedding O
, O
his O
wife O
introduced O
the O
couple O
. O

Brad B-PERSON
Pitt I-PERSON
, O
Gwyneth B-PERSON
Paltrow I-PERSON
, O
Robin B-PERSON
Williams I-PERSON
, O
George B-PERSON
Clooney I-PERSON
, O
any O
other O
people O
around O
there O
are O
specially O
fond O
of O
? O

Well O
, O
I O
think O
that O
is O
the O
most O
unusual O
thing O
about O
it O
. O

I O
mean O
I O
have O
some O
friends O
who O
live O
up O
in O
there O
next O
to O
the O
woods O
and O
people O
are O
just O
surprised O
that O
they O
would O
choose O
this O
little O
tiny O
village O
in O
Scotland B-GPE
. O

It O
is O
the O
juxtaposition O
of O
that O
glamour O
, O
I O
mean O
a B-PERSON
Gwyneth I-PERSON
Paltrow I-PERSON
in O
Inverness B-GPE
. O

It O
just O
does O
n't O
sound O
what O
they O
are O
thinking O
about O
. O

And O
, O
of O
course O
, O
Stella B-PERSON
McCartney I-PERSON
is O
there O
too O
and O
apparently O
Celine B-PERSON
Dion I-PERSON
. O

But O
it O
is O
pretty O
amazing O
, O
all O
these O
Hollywood B-GPE
stars O
in O
this O
quiet O
, O
sleepy O
village O
that O
is O
n't O
really O
famous O
for O
anything O
. O

So O
this O
must O
be O
a O
real O
boom O
to O
the O
local O
economy O
? O

Oh O
absolutely O
, O
I O
mean O
it O
's O
been O
estimated O
that O
3 B-MONEY
million I-MONEY
pounds I-MONEY
, O
which O
is O
about B-MONEY
5 I-MONEY
million I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
, O
will O
be O
made O
over O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
few I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
in O
Dornoch B-GPE
just O
from O
journalists O
and O
celebrities O
and O
sort O
of O
sightseers O
I O
guess O
coming O
to O
see O
where O
Madonna B-PERSON
got O
married O
. O

Gosh O
, O
this O
must O
be O
you O
know O
about B-CARDINAL
five I-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
times O
the O
local O
budget O
there O
. O

Yeah O
, O
absolutely O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
they O
'll O
know O
what O
to O
do O
with O
all O
that O
money O
out O
there O
. O

There O
is O
only O
so O
many O
sheep O
you O
can O
buy O
. O

But O
the B-ORG
Scottish I-ORG
Tourist I-ORG
Board I-ORG
are O
also O
planning O
on O
cashing O
in O
on O
it O
and O
they O
're O
estimating O
some B-MONEY
60 I-MONEY
million I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
will O
be O
made O
over O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
few I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
just O

It O
was O

both O

John B-PERSON
Moore I-PERSON

says O
it O
was O
a O
mistake O
for O
those O

to O
move O
to O
Aden B-GPE
. O

I O
tend O
to O
fault O
the O
US B-GPE
policy O
that O
brought O
the O
refueling O
activity O
from O
Djibouti B-GPE
to O
Aden B-GPE
, O
given O
the O
abundance O
of O
threat O
indicators O
in O
the O
country O
, O
that O
being O
Yemen B-GPE
. O

It O
has O
been O
known O
for O
some O
time O
that O
various O
groups O
, O
either O
Palestinians B-NORP
, O
North B-NORP
African I-NORP
groups O
, O
some O
of O
Bin B-PERSON
Laden I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
men O
actively O
reside O
in O
Yemen B-GPE
, O
so O
again O
, O
I O
really O
question O
the O
wisdom O
of O
that O
policy O
. O

You O
say O
that O
the O
US B-GPE
was O
using O
Djibouti B-GPE
for O
more O
or O
less O
the O
same O
purposes O
that O
, O
for O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
year I-DATE
or I-DATE
so I-DATE
, O
they O
have O
been O
using O
Yemen B-GPE
, O
that O
they O
knew O
that O
there O
was O
a O
much O
more O
anti-American B-NORP
atmosphere O
in O
Yemen B-GPE
. O

Why O
then O
did O
they O
go O
there O
? O

Did O
they O
have O
some O
other O
overriding O
concerns O

The O
US B-GPE
has O
been O
attempting O
to O
support O
movements O
for O
democratization O
in O
Yemen B-GPE
and O
there O
has O
been O
some O
attempts O
to O
buttress O
the O
government O
of O
Ali B-PERSON
Abdullah I-PERSON
Saleh I-PERSON
and O
I O
believe O
that O
this O
is O
directly O
tied O
into O
that O
. O

There O
were O
elections O
held O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
a B-DATE
year I-DATE
or I-DATE
so I-DATE
ago I-DATE
. O

The O
Americans B-NORP
were O
involved O
as O
far O
as O
assessing O
and O
evaluating O
the O
validity O
of O
the O
elections O
, O
and O
I O
think O
this O
grew O
out O
of O
that O
policy O
of O
supporting O
the O
Yemeni B-NORP
government O
, O
but O
again O
the O
problem O
that O
the O
Yemeni B-NORP
government O
faces O
is O
they O
do O
n't O
actively O
control O
the O
countryside O
. O

That O
is O
split O
between O
various O
tribal O
groups O
and O
there O
is O
also O
, O
as O
I O
mentioned O
, O
extremists O
that O
look O
at O
Yemen B-GPE
as O
, O
say O
, O
heaven O
. O

They O
have O
been O
there O
for O
well O
on O
20 B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
various O
groups O
at O
different O
times O
, O
of O
course O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
talking O
about O
Yemen B-GPE
and O
giving O
us O
a O
feeling O
for O
what O
is O
interesting O
about O
this O
country O
, O
another O
thing O
that O
is O
interesting O
about O
it O
would O
seem O
to O
be O
that O
this O
is O
a O
country O
that O
had O
pretty O
much O
sided O
, O
as O
I O
understand O
it O
, O
with O
Iraq B-GPE
during O
the B-EVENT
Gulf I-EVENT
War I-EVENT
. O

Is O
that O
true O
and O
if O
so O
why O
is O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
involved O
with O
it O
now O
? O

That O
is O
true O
. O

The O
government O
of O
Yemen B-GPE
, O
led O
by O
the O
current O
President O
Ali B-PERSON
Abdullah I-PERSON
Saleh I-PERSON
, O
did O
exhibit O
pro-Iraqi B-NORP
sentiment O
during O
the B-EVENT
Gulf I-EVENT
War I-EVENT
. O

As O
far O
as O
the O
reasoning O
behind O
why O
the O
US B-GPE
is O
trying O
to O
rebuild O
its O
ties O
with O
Yemen B-GPE
, O
again O
the O
US B-GPE
policy O
is O
to O
try O
to O
build O
a O
bridge O
with O
as O
many O
countries O
as O
possible O
within O
a O
region O
, O
particularly O
the O
Islamic B-NORP
world O
. O

We O
hope O
the O
countries O
can O
become O
potential O
friends O
, O
if O
not O
allies O
, O
in O
the O
region O
. O

So O
there O
is O
a O
bit O
of O
, O
ok O
, O
yes O
we O
do O
n't O
agree O
with O
what O
you O
did O
in O
the O
past O
, O
but O
let O
's O
try O
to O
put O
that O
behind O
us O
and O
look O
forward O
. O

And O
what O
have O
the O
developments O
there O
led O
you O
to O
believe O
about O
the O
wisdom O
of O
that O
policy O
? O

The O
wisdom O
of O
trying O
to O
establish O
ties O
with O
the O
Yemeni B-NORP
government O
, O
I O
can O
certainly O
see O
the O
logic O
behind O
that O
. O

Again O
my O
specific O
question O
comes O
in O
to O
why O
they O
moved O
the O
refueling O
activity O
from O
Djibouti B-GPE
to O
Aden B-GPE
, O
given O
the O
level O
of O
threat O
in O
the O
country O
. O

It O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
to O
build O
relationships O
, O
it O
is O
another O
thing O
to O
put O
actually O
your O
men O
and O
women O
on O
the O
front O
line O
, O
when O
they O
did O
n't O
have O
to O
be O
there O

you O

By O

Japan B-GPE

only O
one B-CARDINAL
in O

goes O

It O
is O
very O

You O
would O
think O
that O

are O
so O

so O

so O
technically O

that O
they O
would O
be O
at O

Internet O
access O

run O
as B-CARDINAL
much I-CARDINAL
as I-CARDINAL
10 I-CARDINAL
times O
as O
high O
as O

the O
politically O
powerful O

. O

Though O
its O
sky O
high O
rates O
are O
why O
Japanese B-NORP
do O
n't O
go O
on O
line O
as O
much O
as O
citizens O
elsewhere O
, O
but O
Jupiter B-ORG
chief O
Daniels B-PERSON
says O
it O
all O
comes O
down O
to O
conservative O
, O
conformist O
, O
consensus O
lobbying O
Japanese B-NORP
society O
itself O
that O
's O
impeding O
growth O
of O
the O
internet O
here O
. O

I O
think O
it O
really O
reverts O
back O
in O
to O
these O
traditional O
values O
, O
the O
way O
Japanese B-NORP
are O
educated O
and O
basically O
individualism O
is O
not O
encouraged O
in O
neither O
school O
setting O
or O
corporate O
setting O
, O
and O
the O
people O
who O
are O
really O
making O
a O
difference O
in O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
are O
individuals O
who O
are O
entrepreneurs O
. O

They O
will O
come O
up O
with O
an O
idea O
, O
take O
the O
risk O
and O
lead O
. O

They O
are O
not O
afraid O
to O
go O
against O
normal O
traditional O
ways O
of O
doing O
things O
and O
taking O
personal O
risk O
, O
and O
in O
Japan B-GPE
you O
do O
n't O
see O
that O
risk O
factor O
as O
evident O
as O
what O
you O
would O
find O
in O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
. O

Which O
partly O
explains O
why O
Japanese B-NORP
political O
leaders O
such O
as O
Prime O
Minister O
Yoshiro B-PERSON
Mori I-PERSON
are O
in O
a O
fix O
. O

Well O
, O
desperate O
to O
escape O
the O
economic O
stagnation O
that O
has O
mired O
this O
country O
for O
over B-DATE
a I-DATE
decade I-DATE
, O
they O
also O
worry O
that O
traditional O
ways O
of O
life O
would O
be O
swept O
aside O
by O
the O
internet O
with O
dotcom O
jobs O
replacing O
life O
- O
long O
employment O
security O
, O
e-commerce O
endangering O
business O
built O
on O
personal O
relationships O
. O

They O
hate O
to O
see O
some O
of O
the O
traditional O
values O
that O
Japan B-GPE
has O
always O
distinguished O
itself O
, O
starting O
to O
erode O
. O

Again O
, O
Lee B-PERSON
Daniels I-PERSON
. O

And O
there O
is O
a O
conflict O
that O
exists O
. O

As O
you O
start O
moving O
down O
this O
path O
towards O
technical O
innovation O
, O
it O
invites O
disruption O
or O
it O
brings O
about O
the O
conflict O
much O
quicker O
than O
I O
think O
most O
people O
would O
be O
prepared O
to O
start O
dealing O
with O
it O
. O

I O
think O
there O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
issues O
that O
Japan B-GPE
is O
starting O
to O
question O
, O
how O
do O
they O
adapt O
, O
how O
do O
they O
change O
, O
how O
do O
they O
preserve O
what O
is O
good O
about O
their O
society O
while O
making O
these O
changes O
to O
be O
more O
competitive O
with O
what O
's O
happening O
throughout O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
. O

In O
a O
crisis O
, O
such O
as O
right O
after O
World B-EVENT
War I-EVENT
II I-EVENT
, O
Japan B-GPE
has O
proven O
adept O
at O
rapid O
change O
, O
but O
in O
the O
past O
drastic O
reform O
has O
always O
been O
masterminded O
from O
above O
by O
Japanese B-NORP
bureaucrats O
. O

A O
true O
internet O
connected O
society O
and O
economy O
wo O
n't O
emerge O
, O
say O
experts O
, O
without O
a O
grassroots O
led O
revolution O
, O
and O
that O
would O
be O

The O

seemed O

when O
hundreds B-CARDINAL
of I-CARDINAL
thousands I-CARDINAL
of O

forced O
the O
ouster O

but O
now O
the O
events O

beginning O

look O
like O

I B-CARDINAL

Talks O
today B-DATE
between O

President O
Vojislav B-PERSON
Kostunica I-PERSON
and O
members O
of O
the O
Milosevic B-PERSON
's O
Socialist B-ORG
Party I-ORG
yielded O
more O
heat O
than O
light O
. O

Kostunica B-PERSON
's O
people O
accused O
the O
Socialists B-NORP
of O
trying O
to O
hold O
on O
to O
the O
institutions O
of O
power O
and O
as O
if O
on O
cue O
, O
it O
was O
announced O
that O
a O
key O
Milosevic B-PERSON
loyalist O
is O
taking O
over O
the B-ORG
Interior I-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
, O
which O
runs O
the O
police O
. O

The O
World B-ORG
's O
Nenad B-PERSON
Chebeck I-PERSON
is O
in O
Belgrade B-GPE
. O

Nenad B-PERSON
, O
what O
do O
we O
know O
of O
this O
Milosevic B-PERSON
ally O
? O

Well O
, O
it O
's O
Mirco B-PERSON
Merianovic I-PERSON
who O
officially O
still O
is O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
of O
Serbia B-GPE
. O

We O
have O
to O
keep O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
in O
mind O
that O
Vojislav B-PERSON
Kostunica I-PERSON
and O
the O
pro-democracy O
elements O
in O
Serbia B-GPE
and O
Yugoslavia B-GPE
have O
taken O
over O
authority O
on O
the O
federal O
level O
, O
but O
the O
key O
leaders O
of O
power O
are O
on O
the O
republican O
level O
. O

Yugoslavia B-GPE
consists O
of O
two B-CARDINAL
republics O
, O
Serbia B-GPE
and O
Montenegro B-GPE
and O
there O
were O
no O
elections O
for O
neither O
the O
Serbian B-NORP
parliament O
, O
nor O
the O
presidency O
, O
so O
the O
Serbian B-NORP
government O
officially O
is O
still O
in O
place O
. O

But O
that O
's O
all O
theory O
. O

In O
practice O
things O
are O
slightly O
different O
. O

The O
whole O
structure O
of O
power O
in O
Serbia B-GPE
and O
Yugoslavia B-GPE
was O
based O
on O
one B-CARDINAL
man O
, O
Milosevic B-PERSON
. O

Once O
he O
collapsed O
, O
politically O
and O
he O
has O
collapsed O
when O
he O
resigned O
officially O
on O
national O
television O
, O
all O
the O
old O
structures O
of O
power O
collapsed O
together O
with O
him O
. O

Well O
, O
since O
, O
although O
, O
officially O
you O
got O
two B-CARDINAL
different O
parallel O
governments O
going O
on O
, O
the O
reality O
is O
that O
Mr. O
Kostunica B-PERSON
is O
trying O
to O
consolidate O
his O
power O
over O
Yugoslavia B-GPE
, O
what O
other O
indications O
are O
there O
that O
he O
is O
having O
trouble O
doing O
that O
? O

The O
taking O
over O
of O
all O
the O
leaders O
of O
power O
for O
Mr. O
Kostunica B-PERSON
and O
his O
allies O
is O
a O
process O
which O
definitely O
takes O
time O
. O

Everybody O
is O
impatient O
, O
especially O
here O
in O
Belgrade B-GPE
and O
Serbia B-GPE
. O

The O
people O
that O
I O
see O
on O
the O
street O
and O
that O
I O
hear O
from O
are O
sick O
and O
tired O
of O
Milosevic B-PERSON
cronies O
appearing O
on O
television O
protesting O
against O
this O
and O
trying O
to O
hang O
on O
to O
whatever O
little O
power O
they O
have O
at O
the O
moment O
. O

However O
, O
Mr. O
Kostunica B-PERSON
and O
the B-ORG
Democratic I-ORG
Alliance I-ORG
of I-ORG
Serbia I-ORG
has O
said O
very O
openly O
today B-DATE
that O
they O
will O
not O
put O
up O
with O
this O
kind O
of O
behavior O
for O
much O
longer O
. O

They O
have O
indeed O
threatened O
Milosevic B-PERSON
allies O
that O
they O
are O
going O
to O
bring O
out O
the O
people O
onto O
the O
streets O
again O
so O
that O
a O
completely O
new O
authority O
can O
be O
established O
, O
not O
just O
on O
the O
federal O
level O
, O
but O
also O
on O
the O
level O
of O
the B-GPE
Republic I-GPE
of I-GPE
Serbia I-GPE
. O

Let O
's O
talk O
a O
little O
bit O
also O
about O
other O
important O
policies O
of O
the O
government O
, O
of O
importance O
to O
people O
outside O
Yugoslavia B-GPE
, O
and O
that O
is O
Kosovo B-GPE
. O

There O
has O
been O
some O
news O
coming O
out O
that O
Yugoslav B-NORP
troops O
are O
going O
to O
return O
to O
Kosovo B-GPE
by O
the B-DATE
end I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

What O
can O
you O
tell O
us O
about O
what O
this O
new O
government O
will O
do O
in O
that O
area O
? O

Well O
, O
it O
is O
a O
report O
that O
was O
brought O
by O
today B-DATE
's O
edition O
of O
Vetrivinia B-ORG
Novostate I-ORG
, O
a O
Belgrade B-GPE
newspaper O
. O

They O
quoted O
Zoran B-PERSON
Zingic I-PERSON
, O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
main O
leaders O
in O
the B-ORG
Democratic I-ORG
Alliance I-ORG
saying O
that O
Yugoslav B-NORP
troops O
and O
police O
will O
be O
policing O
the O
borders O
between O
Kosovo B-GPE
and O
other O
countries O
, O
meaning O
Macedonia B-GPE
and O
Albania B-GPE
. O

Basically O
it O
is O
not O
such O
a O
threatening O
sort O
of O
bit O
of O
a O
news O
as O
it O
might O
seem O
at O
the O
moment O
because O
the O
United B-ORG
Nations I-ORG
resolution O
, O
1244 B-CARDINAL
, O
does O
actually O
provide O
for O
the O
presence O
of O
Yugoslav B-NORP
troops O
and O
police O
on O
the O
borders O
. O

That O
part O
of O
the O
resolution O
here O
and O
the O
resolution O
was O
never O
actually O
applied O
because O
right O
until O
now O
, O
the O
Yugoslav B-NORP
police O
and O
military O
were O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
Milosevic B-PERSON
, O
so O
the O
international O
community O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
have O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
the O
Milosevic B-PERSON
forces O
. O

Well O
, O
how O
is O
the O
international O
community O
dealing O
at O
this O
point O
with O
the O
change O
of O
the O
government O
? O

Who O
is O
there O
and O
what O
kind O
of O
assistance O
are O
they O
offering O
or O
what O
is O
the O
symbolic O
value O
of O
their O
being O
there O
at O
this O
point O
? O

Well O
, O
at O
the O
moment O
it O
is O
a O
race O
, O
who O
is O
going O
to O
get O
to O
Belgrade B-GPE
first B-ORDINAL
. O

Yesterday B-DATE
, O
we O
had O
the O
French B-NORP
Foreign O
Minister O
, O
today O
we O
have O
Budor B-PERSON
Homback I-PERSON
, O
who O
is O
the O
head O
of O
the O
international O
community O
's O
Stability B-ORG
Pact I-ORG
for I-ORG
Southeast I-ORG
Europe I-ORG
. O

We O
also O
saw O
the O
American B-NORP
diplomat O
Willie B-PERSON
Montgomery I-PERSON
who O
arrived O
in O
Belgrade B-GPE
today B-DATE
to O
set O
up O
most O
probably O
a O
meeting O
between O
a O
senior O
U.S. B-GPE
official O
James B-PERSON
O'brien I-PERSON
, O
who O
is O
coming O
to O
Belgrade B-GPE
. O

He O
will O
be O
here O
tomorrow B-DATE
as O
a O
special O
representative O
for O
President O
Clinton B-PERSON
. O

He O
will O
hold O
talks O
, O
probably O
behind O
closed O
doors O
, O
with O
President O
Vojislav B-PERSON
Kostunica I-PERSON
, O
but O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
is O
keeping O
a O
low O
profile O
because O
there O
is O
quite O
a O
lot O
of O
anti-American B-NORP
sentiment O
on O
the O
streets O
here O
in O
Serbia B-GPE
. O

So O
I O
believe O
that O
Washington B-GPE
realizes O
that O
very O
open O
support O
for O
Mr. O
Vojislav B-PERSON
Kostunica I-PERSON
could O
do O
the O

more O
harm O
than O
good O

. O

Andrew B-PERSON
Harding I-PERSON
how O
does O
this O
capture O
affect O
the O
talks O
in O
Egypt B-GPE
? O

Well O
, O
it O
certainly O
is O
not O
going O
to O
help O
matters O
, O
but O
ultimately O
, O
of O
course O
, O
the O
Hezbollah B-ORG
is O
deeply O
critical O
of O
the O
peace O
process O
. O

They O
do O
not O
like O
the O
sort O
of O
deals O
that O
Arafat B-PERSON
appears O
to O
be O
, O
at O
times O
, O
ready O
to O
make O
. O

Though O
, O
I O
think O
that O
if O
they O
could O
stifle O
the O
entire O
peace O
process O
at O
the O
moment O
, O
then O
that O
is O
what O
they O
'd O
like O
to O
do O
. O

There O
are O
lot O
of O
claims O
and O
counter O
claims O
about O
this O
captured O
man O
and O
what O
he O
does O
. O

What O
do O
we O
know O
for O
sure O
about O
him O
? O

It O
is O
very O
difficult O
to O
be O
sure O
at O
the O
moment O
. O

Hezbollah B-ORG
is O
saying O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
, O
the O
Israelis B-NORP
are O
saying O
another O
and O
when O
we O
are O
talking O
about O
a O
possible O
member O
of O
the O
secret O
services O
of O
Mossad B-ORG
, O
it O
is O
very O
hard O
for O
any O
one O
but O
the O
Israelis B-NORP
to O
know O
for O
sure O
. O

Clearly O
, O
this O
is O
a O
man O
who O
was O
travelling O
on O
some O
other O
passport O
somewhere O
in O
Europe B-LOC
, O
whether O
or O
not O
an O
Israeli B-NORP
citizen O
, O
we O
do O
n't O
know O
it O
for O
sure O
. O

Certainly O
Hezbollah B-ORG
say O
he O
is O
. O

He O
would O
appear O
to O
be O
back O
in O
Lebanon B-GPE
, O
under O
Hezbollah B-ORG
guard O
. O

Beyond O
that O
, O
we O
have O
these O
two B-CARDINAL
conflicting O
reports O
from O
Israel B-GPE
and O
Hezbollah B-ORG
. O

I O
guess O
it O
's O
a O
question O
of O
trying O
to O
choose O
which O
is O
the O
more O
credible O
, O
and O
that O
's O
a O
very O
difficult O
call O
at O
the O
moment O
. O

Well O
, O
whatever O
his O
identity O
and O
his O
aim O
, O
Hezbollah B-ORG
is O
using O
the O
information O
about O
him O
as O
a O
bargaining O
chip O
, O
it O
would O
seem O
. O

Husain B-PERSON
Nebrusi I-PERSON
of O
the B-ORG
Hezbollah I-ORG
Information I-ORG
Bureau I-ORG
in O
Beirut B-GPE
had O
this O
to O
say O
this O
morning O
. O

We O
will O
not O
tell O
anything O
about O
the O
conditions O
of O
these O
Israeli B-NORP
captured O
soldiers O
of O
the O
colonel O
unless O
we O
get O
something O
in O
return O
. O

We O
are O
determined O
. O

This O
is O
not O
a O
breach O
of O
the B-LAW
Geneva I-LAW
Convention I-LAW
. O

I O
mean O
, O
I O
would O
be O
saying O
the O
Israeli B-NORP
prisoners O
, O
they O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
even O
see O
the B-ORG
Red I-ORG
Cross I-ORG
as O
they O
did O
n't O
for O
three B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

We O
did O
n't O
even O
know O
the O
least O
information O
about O
them O
. O

So O
, O
Andrew B-PERSON
, O
when O
he O
says O
that O
they O
are O
looking O
to O
get O
something O
in O
return O
for O
information O
about O
these O
captured O
Israelis B-NORP
, O
what O
in O
particular O
do O
they O
want O
to O
say O
? O

What O
are O
they O
hoping O
to O
achieve O
? O

Specifically O
, O
Hezbollah B-ORG
want O
19 B-CARDINAL
prisoners O
that O
are O
currently O
being O
held O
in O
Israeli B-NORP
jails O
. O

Many O
of O
them O
, O
as O
Israel B-GPE
admits O
, O
as O
bargaining O
chit O
in O
this O
' O
Hit O
the O
Tag O
Hostage O
war O
' O
. O

There O
are O
also O
a O
number O
of O
other O
men O
believed O
to O
be O
in O
Israel B-GPE
from O
Iran B-GPE
and O
also O
a O
lot O
of O
Palestinian B-NORP
detainees O
who O
may O
or O
may O
not O
come O
into O
the O
equation O
even O
when O
this O
negotiating O
process O
over O
the O
fate O
of O
these O
hostages O
gets O
off O
the O
ground O
. O

And O
it O
really O
struggles O
to O
get O
off O
the O
ground O
so O
far O
because O
Hezbollah B-ORG
is O
taking O
such O
a O
tough O
line O
. O

Andrew O
, O
can O
you O
tell O
us O
about O
the O
ties O
between O
the O
Hezbollah B-ORG
and O
the O
Palestinians B-NORP
, O
particularly O
in O
the O
recent O
uprising O
. O

I O
mean O
those O
who O
have O
criticized O
the O
Israeli B-NORP
withdrawal O
for O
its O
troops O
from O
Southern O
Lebanon B-GPE
last B-DATE
spring I-DATE
have O
said O
that O
it O
showed O
that O
the O
armed O
uprisings O
have O
won O
the O
day O
and O
forced O
the O
Israeli B-NORP
pullout O
. O

Now O
there O
have O
subsequently O
been O
accusations O
that O
the O
Lebanese B-NORP
Hezbollah B-ORG
has O
tried O
to O
influence O
the O
Palestinians B-NORP
toward O
armed O
revolt O
. O

Is O
there O
any O
evidence O
of O
this O
? O

Well O
, O
the O
Hezbollah B-ORG
certainly O
would O
like O
to O
do O
that O
and O
they O
are O
, O
at O
the O
moment O
, O
extremely O
popular O
in O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
territories O
because O
Palestinians B-NORP
see O
Hezbollah B-ORG
taking O
a O
tough O
line O
at O
a O
time O
when O
many O
of O
them O
are O
critical O
of O
the O
more O
compromising O
route O
that O
Arafat B-PERSON
appears O
to O
be O
taking O
. O

There O
have O
been O
traditional O
differences O
between O
Hezbollah B-ORG
and O
some O
of O
the O
more O
extreme O
groups O
inside O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
areas O
, O
but O
at O
the O
moment O
, O
I O
think O
, O
the O
aim O
of O
Hezbollah B-ORG
and O
other O
groups O
is O
to O
get O
over O
those O
differences O
, O
unite O
and O
form O
a O
very O
strong O
overall O
group O
of O
extremist O
forces O
dedicated O
to O
destroying O
the O
peace O
process O
as O
it O
now O
stands O
. O

imagine O
a O

no O

the O

menu O

We O
knew O
that O
we O
were O
in O
a O
country O
, O
which O
is O
culturally O
sensitive O
. O

From O
day B-DATE
one I-DATE
we O
went O
beefless O
and O
porkless O
, O
so O
we O
could O
look O
after O
the O
sentiments O
of O
both O
the O
Hindus B-NORP
and O
the O
Muslims B-NORP
. O

From O
day B-DATE
one I-DATE
we O
knew O
that O
there O
was O
an O
issue O
about O
vegetarianism O
. O

We O
had O
to O
be O
very O
conscious O
about O
it O
and O
we O
did O
a O
segregation O
in O
our O
kitchens O
, O
which O
has O
been O
unheard O
of O
. O

And O
the O
strategy O
has O
been O
a O
popular O
one O
for O
McDonalds B-ORG
, O
as O
a O
sample O
poll O
of O
lunchtime O
customers O
outside O
a O
restaurant O
in O
South B-GPE
Delhi I-GPE
shows O
. O

We O
get O
a O
lot O
of O
variety O
here O
and O
it O
's O
very O
tasty O
also O
. O

If O
they O
offered O
you O
only O
, O
say O
, O
a O
fully O
western O
menu O
, O
would O
it O
still O
appeal O
to O
you O
? O

No O
, O
no O
that O
's O
not O
good O
. O

I O
think O
it O
should O
be O
both O
, O
the O
Western B-NORP
and O
the O
Indian B-NORP
, O
both O
. O

The O
food O
here O
offered O
is O
a O
lot O
better O
than O
what O
you O
find O
in O
the O
US B-GPE
. O

In O
what O
ways O
? O

Here O
, O
you O
know O
, O
it O
's O
like O
it O
's O
American B-NORP
as O
well O
as O
Indian B-NORP
taste O
. O

It O
's O
a O
very O
wise O
move O
for O
them O
because O
if O
they O
would O
have O
only O
just O
original O
McDonalds B-ORG
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
they O
would O
have O
done O
so O
great O
. O

I O
think O
by O
blending O
things O
, O
you O
know O
, O
they O
have O
done O
a O
very O
wise O
move O
. O

Along O
the O
narrow O
crowded O
streets O
of O
old O
Delhi B-GPE
, O
is O
where O
you O
can O
find O
fast O
food O
, O
Indian B-NORP
style O
. O

These O
are O
roadside O
restaurants O
often O
called O
dhabas O
that O
serve O
up O
recipes O
of O
dal O
, O
vegetables O
and O
stuffed O
puries O
, O
deep O
- O
fried O
in O
oil O
. O

This O
traditional O
and O
cheap O
fare O
has O
proved O
stiff O
competition O
for O
the O
multinational O
fast O
food O
chains O
, O
but O
they O
've O
been O
fighting O
hard O
and O
maybe O
closing O
in O
. O

Pizza O
delivery O
chain O
Dominos B-ORG
turned O
a O
profit O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
after O
five B-DATE
years I-DATE

Dominos B-ORG

adapted O
to O
Indian B-NORP
tastes O
by O
creating O
special O
toppings O
, O
butter O
chicken O
and O
chana O
masala O
pizzas O
. O

The O
simple O
idea O
of O
home O
delivery O
is O
also O
rather O
new O
to O
India B-GPE
, O
but O
seems O
to O
have O
captured O
people O

imagination O
. O

Dominos B-ORG
Chief O
Executive O
Pawan B-PERSON
Bhatia I-PERSON
says O
, O
the O
secret O
of O
their O
success O
is O
to O
introduce O
Western B-NORP
brands O
with O
an O
Indian B-NORP
twist O
. O

If O
I O
walk O
in O
to O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
companies O
who O
failed O
and O
if O
you O
put O
this O
, O
have O
they O
given O
a O
choice O
and O
the O
answer O
most O
of O
the O
time O
will O
be O
no O
. O

They O
have O
decided O
the O
menu O
. O

India B-GPE
is O
a O
deeply O
religious O
and O
traditional O
country O
, O
but O
in O
the O
past O
decade O
thanks O
to O
globalization O
and O
cable O
TV O
, O
the O
population O
has O
been O
exposed O
to O
dozens B-CARDINAL
of O
multinational O
brands O
from O
burgers O
to O
washing O
machines O
and O
pizzas O
to O
Pepsi B-ORG
, O
but O
despite O
the O
desire O
to O
embrace O
globalization O
, O
there O
is O
still O
a O
reluctance O
to O
change O
completely O
. O

Marketing O

Sohail B-PERSON
Seth I-PERSON
, O
believes O
that O
fast O
food O
companies O
will O
only O
survive O
if O
they O
take O
seriously O
the O
need O
to O
be O
culturally O
sensitive O
. O

As O
a O
nation O
we O
do O
n't O
like O
to O
experiment O
too O
much O
, O
so O
food O
is O
such O
a O
personal O
item O
, O
it O
's O
such O
an O
important O
item O
of O
our O
daily O
existence O
that O
the O
last O
thing O
we O
'd O
like O
is O
any O
international O
fast O

company O
coming O
in O
and O
tinkering O
with O

Well O
, O
the O
international O
team O
of O
deep O
- O
sea O
divers O
has O
made O
good O
progress O
today B-DATE
. O

Yesterday B-DATE
, O
if O
you O
remember O
, O
the O
weather O
was O
extremely O
bad O

Storms O
, O
very O
high O
waves O
, O
very O
difficult O

the O

working O

cutting O
out O

What O
happens O
once O
they O
do O
finish O
? O

Do O
they O
actually O
enter O
the O
submarine O
? O

How O
do O
they O
go O
about O
extracting O
the O
bodies O
of O
the O
submariners O
? O

Well O
, O
they O
wo O
n't O
enter O
straight O
away O
. O

First B-ORDINAL
of O
all O
they O
have O
to O
make O
sure O
there O
are O
no O
jagged O
edges O
around O
this O
hole O
, O
because O
one B-CARDINAL
tear O
of O
the O
protective O
suits O
of O
the O
divers O
could O
prove O
fatal O
. O

It O
is O
a O
very O
dangerous O
operation O
. O

Then O
they O
may O
send O
in O
a O
television O
camera O
, O
a O
remote O
- O
controled O
television O
camera O
to O
have O
a O
look O
around O
and O
see O
what O
the O
conditions O
are O
like O
, O
and O
then O
, O
based O
upon O
the O
weather O
conditions O
, O
a O
decision O
will O
be O
made O
whether O
to O
go O
inside O
and O
begin O
the O
search O
for O
bodies O
. O

The O
weather O
is O
so O
vital O
because O
if O
the O
weather O
is O
stormy O
, O
if O
the O
winds O
are O
strong O
, O
then O
it O
makes O
it O
extremely O
dangerous O
for O
the O
Russian B-NORP
divers O
who O
will O
be O
going O
inside O
. O

The O
fear O
is O
that O
the O
umbilical O
cord O
linking O
the O
divers O
' O
suits O
could O
get O
tangled O
, O
could O
get O
damaged O
, O
in O
that O
order O
of O
course O
, O
prove O
fatal O
. O

Are O
there O
also O
concerns O
regarding O
disrupting O
the O
nuclear O
fuel O
aboard O
the O
submarine O
? O

Are O
there O
any O
kind O
of O
environmental O
concerns O
? O

The O
Russian B-NORP
officials O
say O
there O
are O
no O
environmental O
concerns O
at O
the O
moment O
. O

A B-DATE
couple I-DATE
of I-DATE
days I-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
a O
small O
hole O
was O
made O
in O
the O
inner O
hull O
of O
the O
kursk B-PRODUCT
and O
water O
samples O
were O
taken O
. O

They O
were O
tested O
and O
the O
results O
came O
back O
very O
encouraging O
. O

There O
was O
no O
hint O
of O
radiation O
or O
leaking O
fuel O
, O
anything O
like O
that O
. O

So O
I O
think O
officials O
are O
confident O
that O
it O
would O
be O
safe O
to O
go O
inside O
, O
but O
having O
said O
that O
, O
once O
inside O
there O
are O
a O
number O
of O
dangers O
, O
which O
would O
face O
the O
Russian B-NORP
divers O
. O

First B-ORDINAL
of O
all O
, O
visibility O
will O
be O
very O
very O
low O
. O

It O
's O
going O
to O
be O
bitterly O
cold O
, O
and O
there O
is O
going O
to O
be O
enormous O
danger O
from O
jagged O
pieces O
of O
metal O
which O
could O
be O
swimming O
around O
in O
the O
submarine O
. O

Given O
the O
fact O
that O
there O
are O
so O
many O
dangers O
and O
that O
these O
divers O
are O
risking O
their O
own O
lives O
, O
I O
wonder O
if O
there O
is O
consideration O
given O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
this O
may O
not O
be O
really O
worth O
it O
. O

I O
mean O
have O
some O
suggested O
just O
leaving O
the O
sailors O
' O
bodies O
there O
and O
respecting O
the O
site O
as O
a O
grave O
? O

Yes O
, O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
more O
and O
more O
people O
in O
Russia B-GPE
are O
suggesting O
that O
this O
operation O
is O
not O
worth O
risking O
the O
lives O
of O
more O
people O
, O
risking O
the O
lives O
of O
the O
deep O
- O
sea O
divers O
, O
and O
in O
fact O
, O
many O
of O
the O
relatives O
of O
the O
crewmembers O
who O
died O
in O
this O
tragedy O
, O
they O
too O
are O
saying O
that O
the O
operation O
should O
be O
cancelled O
. O

Today B-DATE
many O
of O
the O
relatives O
met O
the O
chief O
of O
the B-ORG
Russian I-ORG
Navy I-ORG
and O
suggested O
the O
same O
thing O
, O
but O
President O
Putin B-PERSON
gave O
his O
word O
that O
the O
operation O
would O
go O
ahead O
, O
and O
it O
does O
seem O
as O
if O
the O
operation O
is O
going O
to O
continue O
. O

Are O
there O
any O
new O
explanations O
coming O
down O
as O
to O
what O
caused O
this O
disaster O
in O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
place O
? O

Well O
, O
today B-DATE
the O
chief O
of O
the B-ORG
Russian I-ORG

, O
Vladimir B-PERSON
Kuroyedov I-PERSON

was O
eighty B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
sure O

the O
Kursk B-PRODUCT

collided O
with O
a O
submarine O
, O
I O
think O
. O

So O
there O
has O
been O
no O
other O
official O
word O
, O
final O
word O
about O
what O
actually O
caused O
this O
tragedy O

There O
is O
a O
government O
commission O
which O
was O
set O
up O
to O
investigate O
the O
causes O

the O
tragedy O
, O
and O
they O
whittled O
out O
a O
number O
of O
possible O
causes O
to O
three B-CARDINAL
. O

They O
have O
said O
that O
it O
was O
either O
a O
collision O

it O
could O
have O
been O
a O

it O

The O

hundreds B-CARDINAL

In O
the B-DATE
two I-DATE
months I-DATE
since O
then O
the B-ORG
United I-ORG
Nations I-ORG
and O
Western B-NORP
governments O
have O
rushed O
to O
welcome O
Yugoslavia B-GPE
back O
into O
the O
international O
fold O
, O
but O
at O
home O
the O
most O
noticeable O
change O
has O
been O
a O
sharp O
increase O
in O
the O
cost O
of O
living O
. O

President O
Kostunica B-PERSON
says O
this O
is O
inevitable O
but O
he O
sees O
better O
times O
ahead O
. O

We O
are O
living O
all O
under O
very O
difficult O
conditions O

Social O
aspirations O
is O
very O
difficult O
and O
that O
is O
something O
which O
has O
to O
do O
with O
Milosevic B-PERSON
regime O
, O
sanctions O
of O
international O
community O
, O
bombing O
of O
this O
country O
last B-DATE

but O
what O
people O
mostly O
appreciate O
is O
that O
sense O
of O
freedom O
. O

The O
West B-LOC
has O
been O
rewarding O
the O
democratic O
reforms O
in O
Serbia B-GPE
with O
big O
aid O
packages O
, O
but O
the O
money O
comes O
with O
some O
conditions O
attached O
. O

Western B-NORP
governments O
want O
Serbia B-GPE
to O
cooperate O
with O
the B-ORG
International I-ORG
War I-ORG
Crimes I-ORG
Tribunal I-ORG
in O
the B-GPE
Hague I-GPE

The O

Belgrade B-GPE

but O
it O
's O
not O
clear O
how O
far O
this O

will O
go O

President O
Kostunica B-PERSON
says O
he O
does O
not O
agree O
with O
demands O
that O
Milosevic B-PERSON
should O
be O
extradited O

The B-GPE
Hague I-GPE

I O
am O
not O

I O
am O

I O
have O
a O
very O
general O
and O
many O
very O
general O
objections O
to O
the O

. O

I O
can O
not O
imagine O
that O
just O
one O
judicial O
instant O
, O
just O
one B-CARDINAL
court O
is O
actually O
enough O
to O
cope O
this O
problems O

After O
winning O
the O
presidency O
in O
September B-DATE
, O
Kostunica B-PERSON
and O
his O
allies O
now O
face O
a O
much O
easier O
task O
with O
Serbian B-NORP
parliamentary O
elections O
in O
less B-DATE
then I-DATE
two I-DATE

time O

The O
latest O
opinion O
polls O

they O
will O
get O
about B-PERCENT
65 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
the O

, O
while O
Milosevic B-PERSON
and O
his O
party O
would O
be O
lucky O
to O
win O
more O
then O
a O
few O
seats O
. O

The O
opposition O
coalition O
has O
been O
an O
alliance O
of O
convenience O
and O
President O
Kostunica B-PERSON
admits O
that O
it O
will O
not O
last O
long O
beyond O
the O

We O
had O
to O
run O

these O
republic O

with O
all O
these O

we O
are O
staying O

these O

of O

quite O

these O
differences O
between O
the O

The O

Zoran B-PERSON
Djindjic I-PERSON

the O

What O
did O
President O
Fox B-PERSON
have O
to O
say O
? O

President O
Vicente B-PERSON
Fox I-PERSON
touched O
on O
the O
biggest O
, O
most O
troubling O
issues O
facing O
Mexicans B-NORP
today B-DATE
. O

He O
spoke O
about O
what O
he O
can O
do O
to O
solve O
the O
poverty O
that O
has O
driven O
so B-CARDINAL
many I-CARDINAL
hundreds I-CARDINAL
of I-CARDINAL
thousands I-CARDINAL
of O
people O
north O

into O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE

He O
wants O
to O
try O
to O
find O
a O
way O
to O
keep O
them O
home O
, O
and O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
other O
things O
that O
he O
touched O
on O
, O
Lisa B-PERSON
, O
he O
says O
that O
Mexico B-GPE
never O
again O
will O
return O
to O
repressive O
means O
to O
try O
to O
control O
the O
people O
. O

My O
government O
will O
not O
tolerate O
that O
these O
methods O
of O
the O
past O
be O
used O
again O
. O

We O
will O
not O
use O
the O
security O
forces O
of O
our O
country O
to O
silence O
critics O
or O
neutralize O
opponents O
. O

Repression O
will O
never O
again O
be O
a O
way O
to O
resolve O
political O
disputes O
. O

And O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
other O
main O
subjects O
he O
touched O
on O
today B-DATE
, O
Lisa B-PERSON
, O
was O
the O
conflicted O
southern O
state O
of O
Chiapas B-GPE
. O

Fox B-PERSON
says O
that O
his O
first B-ORDINAL
presidential O
act O
will O
be O
to O
send O
up O
a O
proposal O
to O
the O
congress O
to O
immediately O
begin O
to O
bring O
a O
process O
of O
peace O
back O
into O
Chiapas B-GPE
State I-GPE
and O
that O
's O
something O
that O
people O
really O
did O
n't O
expect O
to O
happen O
so O
quickly O
here O
. O

All O
of O
these O
issues O
actually O
are O
issues O
that O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
has O
been O
watching O
very O
carefully O
, O
and O
US B-GPE
Secretary O
of O
State B-ORG
Madeleine B-PERSON
Albright I-PERSON
is O
there O
in O
mexico B-GPE
city I-GPE
for O

She O
is O
meeting O

Mexico B-GPE

new O
Foreign B-ORG
Minister O
, O
who O
is O
the O

academic O
Jorge B-PERSON
Castaneda I-PERSON

He O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
lived O
in O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
for O
a O
number O
of O
years O
. O

What O
has O
the O
new O
President O
Fox B-PERSON
said O
so O
far O
about O
relations O
with O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
? O

Fox B-PERSON
says O
that O
Mexico B-GPE
's O
relations O
with O
the O
US B-GPE
are O
strong O
, O
but O
he O
sees O
opportunities O
. O

He O
still O
is O
convinced O
that O
he O
can O
talk O
to O
the O
United B-GPE
States I-GPE
government O
into O
opening O
up O
its O
borders O
and O
eventually O
letting O
in O
more O
Mexican B-GPE
's O
under O
the O
Free O
Trade O
Agreement O
. O

More O
Mexicans B-NORP
, O
who O
would O
come O
in O
to O
the O
country O
legally O
. O

Fox B-PERSON
believes O
that O
in O
20 B-DATE
or I-DATE
30 I-DATE
years I-DATE
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
, O
Canada B-GPE
and O
all O
of O
Latin B-LOC
America I-LOC
should O
be O
one B-CARDINAL
unified O
market O
, O
much O
in O
a O
way O
that O
the B-ORG
European I-ORG
Community I-ORG
is O
unified O
, O
and O
so O
Fox B-PERSON
is O
going O
to O
use O
his O
marketing O
sensibility O
to O
try O
to O
convince O
the O
American B-NORP
people O
that O
this O
is O
the O
way O
to O
go O
. O

Remember O
, O
Fox B-PERSON
comes O
from O
a O
strong O
marketing O
background O
. O

He O
was O
the O
executive O
of O
Coca B-ORG
- I-ORG
Cola I-ORG
from O
Mexico B-GPE
, O
so O
he O
understands O
how O
these O
things O
work O
. O

I O
wonder O
if O
you O
can O
tell O
us O
a O
little O
bit O
about O
something O
that O
Cuban B-NORP
President O
Fidel B-PERSON
Castro I-PERSON
, O
who O
is O
also O
there O
today O
, O
said O
earlier O
in O
the B-DATE
week I-DATE
. O

He O
said O
that O
the O
previous O
President O
Ernesto B-PERSON
Zedillo I-PERSON
was O
too O
much O
of O
a O
servant O
to O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
. O

Is O
that O
issue O
something O
that O
Fox B-PERSON
is O
likely O
to O
pay O
attention O
to O
? O

Is O
that O
kind O
of O
a O
warning O
for O
Fox B-PERSON
at O
all O
? O

That O
's O
definitely O
a O
message O
to O
Vicente B-PERSON
Fox I-PERSON
from O
Fidel B-PERSON
Castro I-PERSON
and O
I O
am O
sure O
that O
other O
Latin B-NORP
American I-NORP
presidents O
feel O
the O
same O
way O
, O
but O
Fox B-PERSON
really O
has O
already O
shown O
very O
early O
on O
that O
he O
is O
going O
to O
try O
to O
be O
an O
unusual O
kind O
of O
leader O
with O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
, O
he O
is O
not O
going O
to O
kowtow O
to O
Washington B-GPE
. O

In O
fact O
, O
just O
weeks B-DATE
after O
he O
was O
elected O
he O
showed O
Washington B-GPE
that O
he O
has O
his O
own O
initiatives O
and O
some O
of O
them O
might O
even O
frighten O
leaders O
in O
our O
national O
capital O
there O
, O
so O
I O
think O
you O
can O
expect O
Fox B-PERSON
to O
continue O
the O
economic O
policies O
that O
Mexico B-GPE
has O
been O
criticized O
for O
, O
that O
is O
following O
the O
economic O
lead O
of O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
, O
but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
he O
will O
come O
up O
with O
concrete O
policies O
for O
dealing O
with O
immigrants O
' O
rights O
and O
other O
such O
matters O
that O
we O
have O
never O
really O
seen O
before O

The O

We O

We O

very O
pleased O

the O

In O

I O
complimented O
the O

the O
very O
good O
investigative O
work O
they O

done O

particularly O
in O
finding O
several O

we O

may O
be O
relevant O

the O
case O

The O
FBI B-ORG

Free B-PERSON

that O
the O
situation O

a O

much O
as O
it O

a O
crime O
scene O

When O
asked O
who O
he O
suspected O
was O
behind O
the O
attack O
, O
Free B-PERSON
cautioned O
it O
's O
still O
too O
soon O
to O
draw O
conclusions O

We O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
be O
speculating O

What O
we O
want O
to O
be O
doing O
now O
is O
investigating O

that O
's O
what O
we O
do O
, O
though O
we O
do O
it O
best O
if O
we O
do O
it O
based O
on O

Facts O

which O

President O

The O

we O

The O

The O

I O
have O
a O
number O

suggestions O
to O
help O
you O
through O
your O
national O
crisis O
over O
who O
should O
be O
the O
next O
President O

And O
The O
World B-ORG
's O
Eddie B-PERSON
Mair I-PERSON
has O
included O
them O
in O
this O
week B-DATE
's O
letter O
from O
London B-GPE
. O

Normally O
I O
would O
n't O
interfere O
in O
your O
politics O
, O
at O
least O
not O
since O
Hillary B-PERSON
Clinton I-PERSON
called O
me O
and O
asked O
whether O
she O
should O
stand O
in O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
. O

I O
advised O
her O
there O
was O
more O
chance O
of O
Rudy B-PERSON
Giuliani I-PERSON
being O
caught O
with O
another O
woman O
than O
there O
was O
of O
her O
winning O
elected O
office O
. O

But O
your O
post-election O
dilemma O
leads O
me O
to O
put O
forward O
a O
number O
of O
ideas O
to O
assist O
you O
at O
this O
, O
the O
most O
critical O
moment O
Americans B-NORP
have O
faced O
since O
they O
changed O
the O
taste O
of O
Coke B-PRODUCT
. O

First B-ORDINAL
of O
all O
, O
what O
about O
allowing O
Clinton B-PERSON
just O
to O
have O
a O
third B-ORDINAL
time O
? O

We O
know O
him O
, O
he O
knows O
us O
, O
and O
it O
has O
never O
been O
dull O
. O

What O
's O
more O
, O
he O
enjoys O
his O
special O
relationship O
with O
Britain B-GPE
's O
Tony B-PERSON
Blair I-PERSON
, O
and O
he O
has O
formed O
special O
relationships O
with O
, O
well O
you O
set O
your O
own O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
intern O
, O
joke O
here O
. O

Another O
way O
of O
deciding O
who O
should O
be O
your O
next O
leader O
is O
by O
putting O
the O
word O
President O
in O
front O
of O
the O
candidate O
's O
surnames O
. O

If O
you O
say O
President O
Gore B-PERSON
, O
does O
it O
send O
a O
shiver O
up O
your O
spine O
? O
and O
surely O
to O
goodness O
we O
'll O
never O
have O
a O
President O
Bush B-PERSON
. O

Certainly O
that O
's O
how O
I O
am O
going O
to O
refer O
to O
them O
both O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
this O
letter O
. O

I O
suggest O
you O
try O
it O
at O
home O
. O

Alternatively O
, O
why O
not O
give O
the O
presidency O
to O
the O
candidate O
who O
stands O
in O
front O
of O
the O
largest O
number O
of O
flags O
during O
his O
news O
conferences O
. O

Both O
President O
Gore B-PERSON
and O
President O
Bush B-PERSON
have O
held O
a O
flurry O
of O
news O
conferences O
in O
recent B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
and O
with O
each O
one O
they O
have O
increased O
the O
number O
of O
Stars B-WORK_OF_ART
and I-WORK_OF_ART
Stripes I-WORK_OF_ART
they O
use O
as O
a O
backdrop O
. O

I O
think O
they O
think O
it O
makes O
them O
look O
patriotic O
and O
presidential O
. O

Things O
got O
out O
of O
hand O
on O
Monday B-TIME
night I-TIME
when O
Al B-PERSON
Gore I-PERSON
appeared O
in O
front O
of O
what O
appeared O
to O
be O
a B-CARDINAL
dozen I-CARDINAL
Stars B-WORK_OF_ART
and I-WORK_OF_ART
Stripes I-WORK_OF_ART
. O

It O
looked O
like O
an O
explosion O
in O
a O
flag O
factory O
. O

I O
stopped O
listening O
to O
what O
he O
was O
saying O
and O
started O
wondering O
where O
this O
would O
end O
. O

By O
tomorrow B-DATE
I O
'm O
confident O
President O
Bush B-PERSON
will O
be O
wearing O
a O
Stars B-WORK_OF_ART
and I-WORK_OF_ART
Stripes I-WORK_OF_ART
suit O
with O
matching O
tie O
, O
shoes O
, O
shirt O
and O
underwear O
. O

On O
Friday B-DATE
, O
Gore B-PERSON
will O
come O
out O
with O
his O
face O
painted O
in O
patriotic O
colors O
and O
by O
the O
weekend O
George B-PERSON
W. I-PERSON
Bush I-PERSON
would O
have O
changed O
his O
name O
to O
' O
America B-PERSON
, O
' O
just O
to O
prove O
how O
American B-NORP
he O
really O
is O
. O

Having O
said O
that O
I O
saw O
the O
Canadian B-NORP
Prime O
Minister O
celebrate O
his O
re-election O
in O
front O
of O
a B-CARDINAL
dozen I-CARDINAL
Maple B-WORK_OF_ART
Leaves I-WORK_OF_ART
, O
but O
who O
cares O
about O
Canada B-GPE
. O

I O
'm O
sorry O
if O
all O
of O
this O
sounds O
like O
a O
load O
of O
nonsense O
which O
undermines O
the O
entire O
principle O
of O

I O
know O
America B-GPE
would O
never O

The O

Glass I-PERSON
reports O
from O
London B-GPE
. O

There O
are O
Floridians B-NORP
all O
over O

Because O

no O

a I-DATE
half I-DATE

Well O
, O
because O
, O
you O
know O
, O
Gore B-PERSON
was O
going O
after O
the O
outer O

very O
hard O
, O
I O
did O
feel O
Friday B-DATE
would O
be O
important O
, O
and O
, O
of O
course O
I O
did O
n't O
think O
, O
it O
would O
get O
down O
to O
this O
but O
who O
would O
n't O
. O

Here O
in O
London B-GPE
, O
Frances B-PERSON

She O

she O

Al B-PERSON

Deek B-PERSON
says O
in O
recent B-DATE

, O
she O
has O
had O
to O
defend O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
's I-GPE
political O
system O
. O

Britains B-NORP
who O
notice O
she O
is O
American B-NORP
, O
have O
let O
her O
know O
what O
they O
think O
of O
the O
elections O
. O

They O
keep O
saying O
, O
" O
Oh O
, O
is O
n't O
that O
terrible O
. O

The O
biggest O
democracy O
in O
the O
world O
and O
it O
's O
all O
falling O
apart O
. O

And O
I O
say O
it O
is O
because O
we O
are O
a O
democracy O
that O
it O
's O
happening O
this O
way O
. O

It O
's O
because O
everybody O
gets O
the O
vote O
. O

It O
's O
because O
people O
will O
not O
let O
things O
slide O
. O

They O
want O
to O
know O
everything O
. O

This O
is O
part O
of O
being O
a O
democracy O
. O

But O
for O
Americans B-NORP
abroad O
, O
says O
Geek B-PERSON
, O
participating O
in O
democracy O
voting O
is O
more O
work O
then O
for O
Americans B-NORP
in O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
. O

You O
have O
to O
make O
a O
very O
conscious O
effort O
and O
it O
takes O
mailing O
two B-CARDINAL
things O
to O
get O
to O
vote O
. O

You O
have O
to O
send O
in O
your O
card O
to O
start O
with O
, O
and O
then O
when O
you O
get O
the O
ballot O
bag O
, O
you O
have O
to O
send O
the O
ballot O
back O
. O

So O
, O
it O
's O
harder O
than O
if O
you O
just O
wandered O
up O
to O
your O
poll O
on O
Election B-DATE
Day I-DATE
and O
voted O
because O
you O
have O
been O
registered O
for O

In O

did O

Her O

arrived O

Her O

said O
voting O
was O
a O
waste O

time O

but O
she O

Now O
London B-PERSON

she O
is O
glad O
she O
did O

listen O

her O

and O
so O
is O
he O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
think O
anything O
of O
it O
and O
so O
when O
my O
grandson O
called O
Wednesday B-TIME

to O
say O
, O
' O
Wake O
up O
, O
today B-DATE
your O

, O
then O
it O
was O
really O
a O
matter O

, O
you O
know O
, O
our O
vote O
not O
only O
does O
it O
count O
like O
it O
shows O
in O
any O
election O
, O
but O
it O
really O
counts O
in O
the O
final O
and O
we O
voted O
an O
absentee O
ballot O
. O

But O
Londons B-PERSON
did O
n't O
say O
which O
way O
they O
voted O
but O
they O
have O
cast O

in O

This B-DATE

says O

has O
been O
special O
and O
a O
little O
frightening O
. O

It O
's O
quite O
a O
daunting O
feeling O
to O
think O
that O
, O
you O
know O
, O
of O
hundreds B-CARDINAL
and O
millions B-CARDINAL
of O
people O
, O
you O
know O
, O
in O
this O
case O
our O
vote O
counts O
, O
although O
it O
does O
n't O
count O
more O
than O
any O
other O
citizen O
's O
vote O
, O
in O
this B-TIME
particular I-TIME
moment I-TIME
it O
counts O
more O
than O
everybody O
else O

, O
because O
that O

what O

the O

he O

who O
went O
alone O

and O
clearly O
, O
the O
Palestinians B-NORP
would O
be O
less O
likely O

he O

Opinion O

him O
neck O

trails O
former O

by O
16 B-CARDINAL
points O
according O
to O
one B-CARDINAL
poll O
. O

Among O
Labor B-ORG
Party I-ORG
activists O
such O
as O
legislator O
Yael B-PERSON
Dayan I-PERSON
there O
is O
a O
sense O
of O
confusion O
about O
Barak B-PERSON
's O
unpopularity O
. O

It O
certainly O
objectively O
does O
n't O
make O
any O
sense O
. O

It O
means O
we O
have O
to O
try O
harder O
and O
to O
remind O
people O
why O
they O
said O
such O
a O
big O
no O
to O
Netanyahu B-PERSON
only B-DATE
a I-DATE
year I-DATE
and I-DATE
a I-DATE
half I-DATE

. O

Barak B-PERSON
can O
win O

if O
he O
comes O
to O
the O
elections O
with O
an O
indication O
of O
continuation O
of O
the O
peace O
, O
he O
's O
got O
a O
majority O
. O

The O
discredited O
former O
Prime O
Minister O
Benjamin B-PERSON
Netanyahu I-PERSON
now O
faces O
a O
number O
of O
legal O
obstacles O
before O
he O
can O
challenge O
Barak B-PERSON
for O
the O
top O
job O
. O

According O
to O
current O
legislation O
only O
a O
member O
of O
parliament O
can O
stand O
for O
the O
position O
of O
Prime O
Minister O
. O

Netanyahu B-PERSON
supporters O
are O
calling O
either O
for O
a O
change O
in O
the O
law O
or O
for O
simultaneous O
elections O
for O
the O
Knesset B-ORG
and O
Prime O
Minister O
, O
which O
would O
allow O
their O
candidate O
to O
run O
. O

Senior O
Likud B-ORG
activists O
like O
Yosee B-PERSON
Ahmed I-PERSON
say O
that O
Barak B-PERSON
's O
decision O
to O
call O
an O
election O
just O
for O
Prime O
Minister O
wo O
n't O
save O
him O
from O
his O
opponent O
in O
the O
country O
or O
in O
the O
Knesset B-ORG
. O

Barak B-PERSON
did O
n't O
just O
do O
some O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
which O
is O
very O
cynical O
, O
he O
also O
did O
something O
which O
is O
not O
very O
clever O
politically O
because O
there O
is O
a O
, O
built O
- O
in O
majority O
in O
the O
Knesset B-ORG
against O
him O
and O
if O
there O
are O
elections O
only O
for O
Prime O
Minister O
, O
even O
if O
he O
is O
elected O
again O
, O
how O
can O
he O
manage O
the O
country O
with O
the O
built O
- O
in O
majority O
against O
him O
. O

So O
, O
I O
would O
therefore O
call O
his O
act O
an O
act O
of O
extreme O
irresponsibility O
. O

As O
the O
political O
tempo O
quickens O
in O
Israel O
, O
so O
the O
violence O
continues O
in O
the B-GPE
West I-GPE

Barak B-PERSON

bad O

the O

the O

It O
