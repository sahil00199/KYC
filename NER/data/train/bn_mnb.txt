To O

some O

the O
story O
behind O
the O
numbers O
that O
will O
send O
Hillary B-PERSON
Rodham I-PERSON
Clinton I-PERSON
to O
the O
Senate B-ORG
, O
let O
me O
tell O
you O
what O
some O
of O
our O
exit O
polling O
data O
seems O
to O
suggest O
. O

As O
far O
as O
a O
gender O
gap O
, O
voters O
who O
said O
they O
voted O
for O
Mrs. O
Clinton B-PERSON
, O
58 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
them O
women O
, O
47 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
men O
. O

Now O
on O
the O
big O
issue O
the O
people O
thought O
would O
be O
the O
heart O
of O
this O
race O
, O
the O
notion O
that O
Mrs. O
Clinton B-PERSON
was O
accused O
of O
being O
a O
carpet O
bagger O
, O
a O
woman O
born O
in O
Illinois B-GPE
, O
made O
much O
of O
her O
professional O
life O
in O
Arkansas B-GPE
and O
of O
course O
has O
been O
living O
in O
Washington B-GPE
until O
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
voters O
said O
52 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
them O
, O
that O
that O
issue O
did O
not O
matter O
to O
them O
at O
all O
. O

Also O
an O
important O
constituency O
for O
Mrs. O
Clinton B-PERSON
, O
the O
Jewish B-NORP
vote O
. O

It O
appears O
she O
has O
earned O
58 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
the O
Jewish B-NORP
vote O
. O

This O
has O
been O
a O
tough O
race O
, O
too O
, O
where O
Rick B-PERSON
Lazio I-PERSON
, O
the O
congressman O
of O
eight B-DATE
years I-DATE
from O
Long B-LOC
Island I-LOC
was O
accused O
of O
being O
much O
more O
tough O
as O
a O
campaigner O
-- O

A O
lot O
of O
mud O
was O
slung O
on O
both O
sides O
of O
this O
race O
, O
but O
when O
voters O
were O
questioned O
about O
that O
, O
they O
said O
-- O
68 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
that O
Mr. O
Lazio B-PERSON
attacked O
unfairly O
, O
and O
57 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
said O
Mrs. O
Clinton B-PERSON
did O
. O

So O
that O
's O
some O
of O
the O
picture O
that O
makes O
up O
the O
results O
tonight O
that O
sent O
Hillary B-PERSON
Rodham I-PERSON
Clinton I-PERSON
to O
Washington B-GPE
. O

Brian B-PERSON
? O

All O
right O
, O
Kelly B-PERSON
O'Donnell I-PERSON
, O
thank O
you O
very O
much O

And O
about O
just O
how O
this O

went O
the O
way O
it O
did O
tonight B-TIME
in O
New B-GPE

a O

Forrest B-PERSON

A O
few O
more O
of O
those O
numbers O
Kelly B-PERSON
was O
talking O
about O
for O
you O
to O
look O
at O
, O
Brian B-PERSON
. O

As O
she O
mentioned O
, O
men O
and O
women O
did O
split O
their O
vote O
. O

Let O
's O
look O
at O
Jewish B-NORP
voters O
. O

New B-NORP
Yorkers I-NORP
know O
that O
this O
was O
a O
huge O
battle O
over O
support O
for O
Israel B-GPE
and O
whether O
the O
support O
for O
Palestine B-GPE
was O
strong O
enough O
. O

As O
you O
look O
at O
this O
, O
though O
, O
Jewish B-NORP
voters O
went O
by O
a O
big O
margin O
for O
Hillary B-PERSON
Clinton I-PERSON
. O

58 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
to O
Rick B-PERSON
Lazio I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
41 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
. O

New B-NORP
Yorkers I-NORP
remember O
the O
campaign O
debate O
where O
Rick B-PERSON
Lazio I-PERSON
walked O
over O
to O
Hillary B-PERSON
Clinton I-PERSON
and O
said O
you O
're O
going O
to O
sign O
this O
pledge O
about O
campaign O
moneys O
, O
you O
're O
going O
to O
sign O
it O
. O

That O
. O

Was O
she O
attacked O
unfairly O
, O
68 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
did O
say O
yes O
. O

57 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
went O
for O
Clinton B-PERSON
, O
and O
as O
for O
Lazio B-PERSON
's O
voters O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
said O
this O
was O
a O
campaign O
about O
Hillary B-PERSON
Clinton I-PERSON
. O

Rick B-PERSON
Lazio I-PERSON
is O
this O
other O
guy O
. O

In O
fact O
they O
asked O
of O
his O
voters O
, O
how O
many O
voted O
against O
Hillary B-PERSON
Clinton I-PERSON
-- O

50 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
said O
we O
're O
voting O
against O
her O
, O
we O
're O
not O
voting O
for O
Rick B-PERSON
Lazio I-PERSON
, O
we O
're O
voting O
against O
Senate B-ORG
Hillary B-PERSON
, O
and O
that O
shows O
you O
that O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
as O
Chris B-PERSON
pointed O
out O
, O
she O
really O
is O
a O
tremendous O
lightning O
rod O
. O

This O
campaign O
was O
about O
Hillary B-PERSON
Clinton I-PERSON
, O
do O
you O
like O
her O
or O
do O
you O
not O
. O

Scombrort O
of O
Hillary B-PERSON
Clinton I-PERSON
voters O
were O
voting O
for O
Hillary B-PERSON
Clinton I-PERSON
, O
not O
against O
Rick B-PERSON
Lazio I-PERSON
, O
and O
on O
the O
which O
one O
attacked O
the O
other O
more O
unfairly O
, O
the O
voters O
said O
that O
Lazio B-PERSON
attacked O
Hillary B-PERSON
Clinton I-PERSON
more O
unfairly O
, O
and O
that O
possibly O
played O
into O
the O
gap O
in O
the O
Jewish B-NORP
vote O
, O
which O
is O
heavily O
in O
favor O
of O
Hillary B-PERSON
Clinton I-PERSON
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
scene O
that O
you O
mentioned O
, O
the O
debate O
, O
where O
Lazio B-PERSON
invaded O
her O
space O
, O
as O
they O
say O
, O
he O
hit O
very O
hard O
in O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
two I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
on O
issues O
involved O
in O
the B-LOC
Middle I-LOC
East I-LOC
. O

The O
Republican B-NORP
campaign O
, O
not O
directly O
through O
Lazio B-PERSON
, O
but O
others O
was O
actually O
associating O
in O
certain O
ways O
Mrs. O
Clinton B-PERSON
's O
sympathies O
with O
the O
Arab B-NORP
sides O
in O
the B-LOC
Middle I-LOC
East I-LOC
with O
the O
attack O
on O
the O
battle O
ship O
Cole B-PRODUCT
. O

It O
got O
out O
of O
hand O
and O
so O
this O
vote O
could O
well O
be O
as O
much O
a O
rejection O
of O
the O
Lazio B-PERSON
campaign O
as O
it O
is O
also O
a O
very O
positive O
setting O
about O
Hillary B-PERSON
's O
numbers O
, O
and O
you O
remember O
after O
Rick B-PERSON
Lazio I-PERSON
had O
pressed O
her O
right O
in O
front O
of O
the O
debate O
crowd O
, O
they O
said O
What O
do O
you O
think O
of O
this O
and O
women O
said O
It O
reminds O
me O
of O
my O
husband O
or O
in O
some O
cases O
my O
ex-husband O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
it O
and O
we O
see O
that O
women O
and O
particularly O
working O
women O
went O
by O
a O
large O
measure O
for O
Hillary B-PERSON
Clinton I-PERSON
, O
and O
Lawrence B-PERSON
, O
there O
is O
this O
as O
well O
. O

Opinions O
about O
her O
husband O
appear O
to O
have O
been O
important O
in O
voters O
' O
decisions O
. O

2 B-CARDINAL
/ I-CARDINAL
3 I-CARDINAL
approve O
of O
the O
job O
that O
Bill B-PERSON

is O
doing O
as O
President O
. O

Hillary B-PERSON
won O
that O
group O
76 B-CARDINAL
to O
23 B-CARDINAL
. O

Among O
those O
who O
disapprove O
of O
her O
husband O
, O
Lazio B-PERSON
won O
91 B-CARDINAL
, O
and O
it O
's O
certainly O
a O
different O
kind O
of O
race O
from O
the O
Moynihan B-PERSON
races O
we O
've O
grown O
accustomed O
to O
where O
the O
question O
was O
would O
he O
get O
68 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
the O
vote O
or O
69 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
the O
vote O
. O

Like O
Hillary B-PERSON
Clinton I-PERSON
has O
come O
out O
on O
top O
by O
a O
very O
wide O
margin O

Thank O
you O

my O

One B-CARDINAL
final O
comment O

I O
want O
to O
reassure O
the O
public O

my O
decision O
in O
this O
process O
has O
been O
made O
carefully O
, O
consistently O
, O
independently O

and O
I O
believe O
correctly O

I O
'm O
very O

your O
patience O

Thank O

Thank O

Let O

Dan B-PERSON
, O
if O
you O
had O
to O
make O
a O
case O
that O
it O
could O
be O
tonight B-TIME
, O
what O
are O
the O
signs O
? O

Well O
, O
I O
think O
the O
number O
one B-CARDINAL
most O
important O
sign O
is O
looking O
at O
what O
happened O
last B-TIME
night I-TIME
, O
and O
that O
is O
last B-TIME
night I-TIME
at I-TIME
about I-TIME
7:00 I-TIME
, O
the O
public O
information O
officer O
of O
the O
court O
came O
to O
us O
and O
said O
we O
're O
going O
home O
. O

We O
are O
told O
, O
in O
effect O
, O
there O
wo O
n't O
be O
a O
ruling O
tonight B-TIME
. O

That O
has O
n't O
happened O
tonight B-TIME
. O

Now O
, O
you O
know O
the O
time O
is O
ticking O
away O
and O
yet O
they O
are O
still O
here O
. O

Everyone O
still O
here O
. O

All O
we O
know O
is O
that O
justices O
Breyer B-PERSON
and O
Souter B-PERSON
have O
been O
seen O
driving O
away O
, O
but O
that O
does O
n't O
necessarily O
tell O
us O
anything O
. O

There O
are O
all O
sorts O
of O
possible O
explanations O
for O
that O
. O

It O
could O
be O
that O
they O
're O
not O
actually O
involved O
in O
finishing O
up O
writing O
one O
of O
the O
opinions O
. O

Remember O
, O
very O
often O
, O
the O
justices O
are O
joint O
in O
another O
justice O
's O
opinion O
. O

It O
also O
could O
be O
that O
the O
opinion O
is O
already O
finished O
, O
and O
, O
of O
course O
, O
there O
's O
always O
the O
possibility O
that O
it O
's O
not O
finished O
, O
but O
I O
think O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
public O
information O
office O
and O
many O
security O
officers O
here O
at O
the O
court O
are O
still O
here O
tells O
us O
that O
the O
court O
is O
in O
all O
likelihood O
still O
working O
on O
this O
case O
. O

Dan O
Abrams O
, O
outside O
the O
, O
still O
active O
court O
tonight B-TIME
. O

Thank O
you O
for O
that O
. O

And O
we O
continue O
tonight B-TIME
to O
try O
to O
measure O
just O
how O
this O
story O
is O
playing O
overseas O
as O
we O
'll O
be O
doing O
each B-TIME
night I-TIME
all B-DATE
week I-DATE

Tonight B-TIME
, O
the O
anchor O
of O
the O
Israeli B-NORP
network O
evening O
newscast O
on O
Channel B-ORG
2 I-ORG
Jerusalem I-ORG
Jacob B-PERSON
Elon I-PERSON
on O
what O
Israelis B-NORP
are O
thinking O
and O
saying O
about O
America B-GPE
's O
long O
wait O
for O
a O
President O
- O
elect O
. O

Frankly O
, O
we O
are O
shocked O
here O
. O

We O
are O
used O
to O
the O
Israeli B-NORP
political O
system O
, O
always O
tied O
and O
always O
tied O
up O
, O
and O
election B-TIME
nights I-TIME
here O
too O
close O
to O
call O
more O
often O
than O
not O
, O
but O
what O
you O
're O
experiencing O
over O
there O
is O
really O
inconceivable O
to O
Israelis B-NORP
. O

They O
spend O
a O
lot O
of O
air O
time O
here O
trying O
to O
convey O
the O
electoral O
system O
to O
my O
viewers O
here O
, O
and O
the O
election O
action O
I O
got O
was O
basically O
Hey O
, O
this O
is O
undemocratic O
. O

This O
is O
the O
greatest O
democracy O
we O
're O
talking O
about O
, O
and O
the O
system O
is O
undemocratic O
, O
and O
the O
turnout O
as O
well O
I O
felt O
's O
over B-PERCENT
90 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
here O
usually O
, O
and O
it O
's O
hard O
for O
Israeli B-NORP
citizens O
to O
grasp O
50 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
. O

Since O
we O
're O
talking O
about O
Israeli B-NORP
reel O
and O
the B-LOC
Middle I-LOC
East I-LOC
, O
it O
's O
not O
, O
you O
know O
, O
the O
major O
headline O
every B-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
but O
it O
certainly O
was O
a O
major O
story O
. O

On O
the B-DATE
election I-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
we O
had O
hours B-TIME
and I-TIME
hours I-TIME
of O
broadcast O
here O
live O
, O
same O
as O
in O
the O
States B-GPE
, O
and O
we O
've O
been O
following O
this O
story O
, O
of O
course O
, O
every B-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
but O
here O
as O
usual O
, O
I O
might O
say O
, O
we O
have O
news O
of O
our O
own O
. O

Actually O
today B-DATE
, O
we O
just O
had O
four B-CARDINAL
Israelis B-NORP
killed O
in O
three B-CARDINAL
separate O
terrorist O
acts O
. O

The O
peace O
forces O
do O
n't O
like O
uncertainty O
, O
I O
would O
say O
even O
less O
than O
the O
stock O
market O
, O
and O
things O
here O
are O
getting O
worse O
day O
by O
day O
. O

Israel B-GPE
is O
usually O
looking O
up O
to O
the O
President O
of O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
for O
some O
help O
. O

Some O
Israelis B-NORP
at O
least O
, O
if O
not O
most O
of O
them O
, O
are O
still O
hoping O
that O
President O
Clinton B-PERSON
might O
be O
able O
to O
intervene O
and O
help O
in O
the O
short O
time O
he O
has O
left O
, O
but O
the O
more O
things O
are O
complicated O
and O
uncertain O
back O
there O
in O
the O
States B-GPE
, O
I O
think O
more O
and O
more O
Israelis B-NORP
are O
worried O
that O
there O
's O
nobody O
to O
turn O
to O
, O
and O
I O
think O
what O
happened O
in O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
few I-DATE
days I-DATE
among O
Israelis B-NORP
here O
is O
a O
new O
perception O
that O
maybe O
things O
in O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
are O
not O
as O
perfect O
as O
they O
might O
have O
thought O
. O

Actually O
, O
they O
're O
far O
from O
being O
perfect O
, O
and O
they O
are O
sounding O
and O
looking O
to O
us O
here O
more O
and O
more O
like O
what O
we O
know O
from O
our O
own O
political O
system O
. O

That O
insight O
tonight B-TIME
from O
Jacob B-PERSON
Eilon I-PERSON
, O
the O
anchorman O
Israel B-GPE
's O
Channel B-ORG

out O

Rabin I-PERSON
. O

She O
died O
yesterday B-DATE

at O
the B-DATE

72 I-DATE

And O
in O
Yugoslavia B-GPE
tonight B-TIME
, O
the O
most O
serious O
challenge O
to O
Slobodan B-PERSON
Milosevic I-PERSON
's I-PERSON

He O
's O
still O
refusing O
to O
concede O
defeat O
in O
last B-DATE
week I-DATE

, O
so O
tens B-CARDINAL
of I-CARDINAL
thousands I-CARDINAL

trying O
to O
drive O
him O
from O

For O
a O
late O
update O
, O
live O
from O
the O

we O
're O
joined O

Good B-TIME

Good B-TIME
evening I-TIME

Brian B-PERSON
. O

Well O
, O
Bush B-PERSON
ended O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
with O
a O
big O
rally O
here O
. O

We O
're O
just O
outside O
of O
Tampa B-GPE
. O

And O
I O
'll O
tell O
you O
, O
these O
evening O
rallies O
really O
have O
the O
feel O
of O
a O
rock O
concert O
, O
or O
maybe O
a O
pro O
wrestling O
match O
. O

You O
have O
strobe O
lights O
, O
you O
have O
screaming O
crowds O
, O
all O
designed O
to O
make O
Bush B-PERSON
look O
like O
a O
winner O
. O

But O
he O
is O
not O
a O
winner O
yet O
in O
Florida B-GPE
. O

There O
is O
one O
new O
poll O
out O
that O
actually O
puts O
Gore B-PERSON
ahead O
here O
. O

There O
are O
still O
several O
polls O
that O
say O
Bush B-PERSON
is O
still O
ahead O
in O
Florida B-GPE
. O

Bottom O
line O
, O
as O
we O
heard O
David B-PERSON
Gregory I-PERSON
report O
, O
this O
is O
not O
the O
position O
the O
campaign O
wanted O
to O
be O
in O
at O
this O
stage O
of O
the O
game O
. O

Bush B-PERSON
's O
central O
message O
on O
this O
bus O
trip O
across O
central O
Florida B-GPE
today B-DATE
was O
to O
his O
diehard O
supporters O
telling O
them O
go O
out O
, O
tell O
your O
friends O
still O
on O
the O
fence O
why O
they O
need O
to O
vote O
for O
me O
, O
and O
it O
's O
a O
message O
the O
campaign O
hopes O
it O
was O
able O
to O
convey O
today B-DATE
, O
because O
while O
Florida B-GPE
is O
a O
must O
- O
win O
, O
they O
also O
can O
not O
ignore O
the O
other O
battleground O
states O
. O

Brian B-PERSON
tomorrow B-DATE
morning B-TIME
, O
Bush B-PERSON
flies O
to O
Pennsylvania B-GPE
, O
another O
swing O
state O
with O
2023 B-CARDINAL
electoral O
votes O
, O
just B-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL
less O
than O
Florida B-GPE
. O

Pennsylvania B-GPE
traditionally O
, O
a O
Democratic B-NORP
state O
, O
but O
one O
where O
there O
's O
a O
popular O
Republican B-NORP
governor O
, O
Tom B-PERSON
Ridge I-PERSON
, O
and O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
pressure O
on O
Ridge B-PERSON
right O
now O
to O
deliver O
Pennsylvania B-GPE
. O

He O
'll O
end O
up O
tomorrow B-DATE
night B-TIME
in O
Ohio B-GPE
, O
and O
then O
end O
the B-DATE
week I-DATE
in O
another O
two B-CARDINAL
crucial O
states O
, O
Wisconsin B-GPE
and O
Michigan B-GPE
. O

Thank O
you O
for O
that O
. O

We O
realize O
that O
many O
of O
the O
people O
joining O

here O
tonight B-TIME

are O
doing O
so O
to O
try O

more O
information O

These O
are O
uncertain O
times O

The O
nation O
has O
yet O
to O
elect O
a O
President O
- O
elect O
. O

It O
's O
something O
Mike B-PERSON
Barnicle I-PERSON
said O
earlier O
on O
our O

today B-DATE
that O
caught O
our O

Mike B-PERSON

how O
it O
felt O

an O
American B-NORP
today B-DATE

Yeah O
, O
Brian B-PERSON

There O
is O
a O
sense O

think O
increasing O
despondency O

on O

Tuesday B-TIME

the B-TIME

it O

turning O

the B-DATE
longest I-DATE

People O
are O
depressed O
enough O
about O

There O
's O
probably O
reason O
why O
these O
two B-CARDINAL
candidates O
split O
this O

so O
evenly O
down O
the O

Neither O

It O
gives O
them O
a O
sense O
of O
what O
they O
have O
felt O
for O
too O
long O
now O

that O

The O
fourth B-ORDINAL
largest O
mountain O
in O
North B-NORP
American I-NORP
, O
nearly B-QUANTITY
18,000 I-QUANTITY
feet I-QUANTITY
high O
, O
erupting O
this B-DATE
week I-DATE
with O
its O
most O
violent O
outburst O
in O
1200 B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

They O
say O
it O
is O
an O
especially O
dangerous O
volcano O
because O
of O
its O
steep O
slopes O
. O

It O
could O
potentially O
wipe O
out O
everything O
in O
its O
path O
. O

40,000 B-CARDINAL
people O
live O
in O
the O
path O

Here O
at O
the B-ORG
National I-ORG

, O
they O
are O
working O
around O
the O

It O
is O
here O
they O
take O
the O
volcano O
's O
pulse O
, O
calling O
it O
unstable O
, O
saying O
Popo B-LOC
is O
simply O
recharging O
, O
getting O
ready O
to O
erupt O
again O
. O

It O
's O
acquiring O
more O
pressure O
, O
and O
eventually O
this O
pressure O
will O
be O
released O
in O
the B-DATE
future I-DATE
days I-DATE
. O

The O
danger O
? O

The O
heat O
from O
Popo B-LOC
's O
lava O
flow O
is O
melting O
the O
glaciers O
on O
the O
sides O
of O
the O
mountain O
and O
could O
trigger O
mud O
slides O
. O

It O
's O
like O
concrete O
coming O
down O
instead O
of O
water O
. O

So O
, O
they O
will O
destroy O
anything O
that O
tries O
to O
stop O
them O
. O

The O
Mexican B-NORP
government O
is O
taking O
no O
chances O
. O

It O
sent O
out O
1,000 B-CARDINAL
troops O
to O
force O
an O
evacuation O
inside O
an O
eight B-QUANTITY

mile I-QUANTITY

Tonight O
, O
20,000 B-CARDINAL
people O
in O
shelters O
, O
but O
another O
20,000 B-CARDINAL
refuse O
to O
leave O
, O
worried O
about O
their O
corn O
harvests O
or O
who O
would O
feed O
their O
animals O
. O

If O
a O
major O
danger O
was O
to O
come O
, O
says O
this O
man O
, O
then O
we O
've O
got O
to O
run O
. O

There O
's O
no O
other O
choice O
. O

Scientists O
say O
Popo B-LOC
has O
a O
huge O
crater O
about B-QUANTITY
half I-QUANTITY
a I-QUANTITY
mile I-QUANTITY
across O
, O
about B-QUANTITY
300 I-QUANTITY

and O
a O

dome O
is O
building O
up O
like O
an O
upside O

down O

In O
contrast O
, O
Mt. B-LOC
Saint I-LOC
Helen I-LOC
had O
a O
dome O

almost O
as O
if O

the O

It O
is O
blowing O
in O
its O
own O
way O
. O

It O
could O
get O
bigger O
. O

We O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
to O
predict O
it O
exactly O
. O

For O
centuries O
here O
, O
the O
people O
have O
had O
almost O
a O
mystical O
relationship O
with O
Popo B-LOC
, O
believing O
the O
volcano O
is O
a O
god O
, O
showering O
their O
crops O
with O
rain O
. O

Tonight B-TIME
, O
they O
fear O
it O
will O
turn O
vengeful O
, O
bringing O
destruction O
after O
1200 B-DATE
years I-DATE
of O
peace O
. O

If O
you O
ask O
the O
Gore B-PERSON
campaign O
, O
the O
fight O
is O
far O
from O
over O

Their O
position O

Our O
report O
tonight B-TIME
from O
Claire B-PERSON
Shipman I-PERSON
. O

A O
confident O
and O
seemingly O
relaxed O
Al B-PERSON
Gore I-PERSON
out O
for O
a O
run O
in O
Nashville B-GPE
. O

Mr. O
Vice O
President O
, O
did O
you O
win O
the O
election O
, O
sir O
? O

We O
're O
having O
here O
. O

He O
is O
effectively O
starting O
a O
second B-ORDINAL
campaign O
for O
the B-FAC
White I-FAC
House I-FAC
, O
this O
one O
in O
the O
court O
of O
public O
opinion O
. O

His O
campaign O
chairman O
in O
Florida B-GPE
with O
a O
tough O
message O
. O

What O
we O
have O
learned O
has O
left O
us O
deeply O
troubled O
. O

Calling O
for O
a O
hand O
recount O
in O
some O
Florida B-GPE
counties O
and O
announcing O
, O
campaign O
will O
support O
lawsuits O
over O
the O
issue O
of O
ballot O
irregularities O
in O
Palm B-GPE
Beach I-GPE
. O

If O
the O
will O
of O
the O
people O
is O
to O
prevail O
, O
Al B-PERSON
Gore I-PERSON
should O
be O
our O
next O
President O
the O
. O

Former O
Secretary O
of O
State B-ORG
Warren B-PERSON
Christopher I-PERSON
also O
pushes O
the O
issue O
hard O
. O

Arising O
out O
of O
this O
the O
need O
for O
redress O
to O
make O
sure O
the O
will O
of O
the O
people O
can O
be O
properly O
honored O
in O
this O
situation O
. O

And O
Daley B-PERSON
, O
turning O
up O
the O
rhetoric O
substantially O
, O
criticizes O
the O
behavior O
of O
the O
Bush B-PERSON
campaign O
. O

I O
believe O
actions O
, O
to O
try O
and O
put O
in O
place O
a O
transition O
, O
run O
the O
risk O
of O
dividing O
the O
American B-NORP
people O
and O
creating O
a O
sense O
of O
confusion O
. O

Gore B-PERSON
officials O
, O
meanwhile O
, O
under O
siege O
by O
reporters O
in O
Nashville B-GPE
. O

I O
think O
we O
need O
our O
seat O
belts O
on O
. O

They O
say O
Gore B-PERSON
is O
not O
simply O
trying O
to O
drag O
out O
the O
inevitable O
, O
that O
he O
does O
have O
a O
shot O
at O
winning O
with O
a O
careful O
shot O
of O
legal O
and O
public O
relations O
tactics O
. O

Most O
Americans B-NORP
do O
n't O
yet O
have O
a O
really O
good O
picture O
of O
Laura B-PERSON
Bush I-PERSON
. O

To O
discuss O
the O
new O
first B-ORDINAL
lady O
, O
we O
are O
rejoined O
by O
our O
panel O
. O

David B-PERSON
, O
why O
do O
n't O
you O
take O
a O
whack O
at O
this O
. O

Have O
you O
ever O
met O
her O
? O

No O
, O
I O
have O
n't O
. O

I O
think O
it O
is O
clear O
, O
though O
, O
from O
watching O
her O
throughout O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
year I-DATE
and I-DATE
a I-DATE
half I-DATE
she O
is O
more O
of O
the O
traditional O
mold O
of O
predecessors O
of O
Hillary B-PERSON
Clinton I-PERSON
than O
like O
Hillary B-PERSON
Clinton I-PERSON
. O

She O
is O
not O
going O
to O
try O
to O
break O
the O
mold O
like O
Mrs. O
Clinton B-PERSON
did O
by O
taking O
an O
active O
role O
in O
policy O
making O
. O

A O
lot O
of O
Americans B-NORP
were O
uncomfortable O
with O
that O
and O
I O
think O
ended O
up O
being O
a O
mistake O
. O

Joyce B-PERSON
, O
it O
looks O
like O
you O
want O
to O
say O
something O
. O

I O
quibble O
with O
the O
idea O
she O
is O
of O
another O
generation O
. O

Not O
every O
wife O
necessarily O
wants O
to O
be O
in O
politics O
just O
because O
her O
husband O
is O
in O
politics O
. O

That O
does O
n't O
make O
her O
a O
throwback O
. O

, O
I O
believe O
it O
is O
probably O
true O
, O
and O
Hillary B-PERSON
also O
learned O
in O
time O
that O
it O
is O
n't O
a O
good O
idea O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
lady O
to O
become O
too O
identified O
with O
specific O
policy O
initiates O
, O
at O
least O
publicly O
. O

I O
think O
she O
herself O
pulled O
back O
on O
that O
. O

Well O
, O
Deborah B-PERSON
, O
let's O
us O
pay O
proper O
respect O
. O

She O
is O
a O
teacher O
and O
cares O
about O
something O
tremendously O
important O
to O
this O
country O
, O
literacy O
. O

Exactly O
. O

She O
has O
worked O
hard O
on O
this O
issue O
. O

She O
will O
tackle O
the O
issue O
the O
same O
way O
Barbara B-PERSON
Bush I-PERSON
did O
, O
encouraging O
reading O
. O

I O
'm O
sure O
she O
will O
have O
programs O
and O
initiatives O
. O

Hillary B-PERSON
Clinton I-PERSON
did O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
too O
. O

She O
is O
out O
with O
another O
book O
, O
Entertaining B-WORK_OF_ART
at I-WORK_OF_ART
the I-WORK_OF_ART
White I-WORK_OF_ART
House I-WORK_OF_ART
and I-WORK_OF_ART
Redecorating I-WORK_OF_ART
the I-WORK_OF_ART
White I-WORK_OF_ART
House I-WORK_OF_ART
. O

Doing O
what O
we O
think O
of O
as O
more O
traditional O
first B-ORDINAL
lady O
things O
can O
be O
very O
, O
very O
effective O
. O

Deborah B-PERSON
, O
you O
remember O
that O
Mrs. O
Clinton B-PERSON
chafed O
at O
the O
idea O
of O
being O
in O
the O
traditional O
role O
. O

She O
was O
not O
at O
all O
happy O
about O
it O
. O

In O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
campaign O
she O
talked O
about O
having O
to O
bake O
cookies O
. O

She O
was O
n't O
pleased O
with O
that O
. O

That O
is O
right O
. O

Joyce B-PERSON
makes O
a O
good O
point O
, O
too O
. O

After O
health O
care O
reform O
failed O
, O
he O
changed O
her O
steages O
a O
bit O
. O

She O
pulled O
back O
. O

She O
began O
doing O
more O
traditional O
things O
in O
public O
, O
whereas O
in O
private O
she O
did O
still O
work O
on O
the O
causes O
she O
cared O
about O
, O
she O
advocated O
and O
lobbied O
in O
a O
quiet O
, O
behind O
the O
scenes O
way O
. O

She O
did O
n't O
make O
a O
big O
deal O
out O
of O
being O
a O
co-president O
anymore O
. O

That O
is O
exactly O
my O
point O
, O
Joe B-PERSON
. O

Mrs. O
Clinton B-PERSON
wants O
to O
deal O
with O
policy O
. O

She O
loves O
that O
and O
is O
steeped O
in O
it O
. O

Clearly O
Mrs. O
Bush B-PERSON
does O
n't O
want O
to O
go O
down O
that O
road O
. O

It O
depends O
. O

Literacy O
is O
a O
big O
problem O
in O
this O
country O
. O

Nothing O
that O
Barbara B-PERSON
Bush I-PERSON
did O
or O
said O
, O
with O
due O
respect O
, O
addressed O
it O
in O
an O
important O
way O
. O

It O
was O
more O
of O
a O
show O
. O

What O
needs O
to O
be O
done O
about O
literacy O
is O
to O
spend O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
, O
which O
President O
- O
elect O
Bush B-PERSON
proposed O
. O

That O
was O
a O
large O
spending O
program O
, O
a O
$ B-MONEY
5 I-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
literacy O
program O
. O

Laura B-PERSON
Bush I-PERSON
could O
be O
a O
big O
help O
with O
that O
, O
not O
like O
Hillary B-PERSON
Clinton I-PERSON
with O
health O
care O
, O
but O
a O
symbol O
with O
teachers O
, O
librarians O
, O
people O
who O
care O
about O
reading O
and O
believe O
every O
American B-NORP
should O
be O
able O
to O
read O
and O
put O
clout O
behind O
it O
. O

In O
that O
way O
she O
could O
be O
a O
great O
asset O
. O

It O
is O
a O
policy O
that O
is O
very O
hard O
to O
disagree O
with O
. O

She O
could O
be O
the O
symbol O
of O
really O
doing O
something O
. O

Let O
us O
hope O
so O
. O

Thank O
you O
for O
talking O
to O
us O
. O

It O
either O
says O
a O
lot O
about O
the O
'' O
getting O
elected O
in O
this O
country O
or O
both O
, O
but O
Jay B-PERSON

Our O
report O
on O
the O
new O
trend O
from O
David B-PERSON
Gregory I-PERSON
. O

It O
's O
eight B-DATE
days I-DATE
before O
the O
election O
, O
and O
guess O
where O
George B-PERSON
W. I-PERSON
Bush I-PERSON
is O
? O

Hi O
. O

How O
many O
in O
your O
party O
? O

We O
like O
our O
champagne O
on O
ice O
, O
please O
. O

Sorry O
I O
did O
n't O
name O
you O
Vice O
President O
. O

Something O
about O
the O
background O
check O
. O

I O
think O
I O
would O
have O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
trouble O
. O

In O
a O
dead O
heat O
with O
Al B-PERSON
Gore I-PERSON
, O
tonight B-TIME
Bush B-PERSON
puts O
issues O
aside O
instead O
playing O
for O
laughs O
with O
the O
late B-TIME
night I-TIME
comedy O
. O

3 O

-- O

Hey O
, O
hi O
, O
Governor O
Bush B-PERSON
. O

Jay B-PERSON
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
light O
that O
in O
here O
. O

The O
stuff O
in O
the O
closet O
is O
highly O
flamabable O
. O

I O
think O
the O
word O
you O
're O
looking O
for O
is O
flammable O
. O

Flamabable O
. O

Flammable O
. O

Jay O
, O
look O
at O
that O
sign O
. O

The O
campaign O
has O
hit O
the O
late O
show O
. O

Both O
Bush B-PERSON
and O
Al B-PERSON
Gore I-PERSON
realize O
there O
's O
votes O
to O
be O
had O
joking O
after O
dark O
. O

If O
you O
're O
elected O
President O
, O
how O
do O
you O
prepare O
yourself O
for O
the O
next O
four B-DATE
years I-DATE
of O
Jay B-PERSON
's O
monologue O
. O

Sorry O
staff O
working O
on O
the O
Jay B-PERSON
chip O
. O

Really O
? O

In O
this O
case O
Jay B-PERSON
stands O
for O
you O
. O

Any O
political O
offensive O
humor O
is O
automatically O
-- O

Oh O
, O
just O
wiped O
out O
. O

And O
you O
're O
not O
kidding O
. O

I O
can O
see O
that O
grin O
. O

Why O
do O
you O
think O
it O
's O
so O
important O
to O
do O
these O
shows O
? O

I O
think O
it O
shows O
a O
different O
side O
-- O
at O
least O
it O
does O
for O
me O
. O

It O
gives O
people O
a O
chance O
to O
show O
I O
know O
how O
to O
laugh O
. O

Not O
only O
laugh O
with O
people O
, O
I O
can O
laugh O
at O
myself O
, O
which O
sometimes O
I O
need O
to O
do O
during O
the O
course O
of O
the O
campaign O
. O

It O
's O
an O
important O
way O
to O
communicate O
in O
a O
slightly O
different O
manner O
to O
people O
that O
are O
really O
tuned O
in O
every B-TIME
night I-TIME
. O

The O
odd O
thing O
about O
him O
is O
, O
in O
the O
dressing O
room O
, O
could O
n't O
be O
looser O
or O
funnier O
. O

You O
're O
under O
a O
lot O
of O
pressure O
. O

It O
's O
a O
tying O
race O
. O

Here O
you O
're O
doing O
schtick O
on O
Jay B-PERSON
Leno I-PERSON
. O

I O
know O
it O
. O

Actually O
, O
I O
'm O
enjoying O
it O
. O

I O
like O
the O
man O
. O

I O
think O
he O
's O
a O
unique O
person O
. O

I O
think O
it O
's O
important O
to O
have O
people O
who O
help O
Americans B-NORP
laugh O
, O
I O
think O
a O
Leno B-PERSON
show O
is O
suitable O
to O
my O
personality O
. O

You O
can O
take O
it O
. O

You O
have O
a O
sense O
of O
humor O
. O

People O
say O
Oh O
, O
not O
a O
bad O
sport O
. O

Because O
ultimately O
, O
we O
're O
not O
a O
country O
that O
values O
intellectuals O
. O

We O
like O
personalities O
, O
and O
if O
have O
a O
good O
personality O
, O
that O
seems O
good O
enough O
. O

That O
's O
scary O
. O

This O
is O
more O
scary O
. O

We O
'll O
be O
right O
back O
. O

Here O
's O
a O
hard O
- O
hitting O
question O
from O
Karen B-PERSON

Do O
you O
keep O
your O
figure O
during O
the O

Have O
you O

I O
would O

Really O

Oh O

Can O

in O
Florida B-GPE

it O
may O
not O
end O
there O

Here O
is O
the O
status O
of O
the O
recount O
as O
of O
this B-TIME
hour I-TIME
. O

The O
two B-CARDINAL
candidates O
separated O
by O
only B-CARDINAL
225 I-CARDINAL
votes O
, O
with O
65 B-CARDINAL
out O
of O
67 B-CARDINAL
counties O
reporting O
. O

It O
has O
narrowed O
dramatically O
all B-TIME
day I-TIME
long I-TIME

Today B-DATE
the O
Gore B-PERSON
campaign O
seemed O
to O
say O
the O
case O
belongs O
in O
Florida B-GPE
state O
courts O
. O

The O
Bush B-PERSON
campaign O
chided O
right O
back O
that O
the O
other O
side O
wants O
to O
keep O
voting O
until O
they O
like O
the O
and O
increasingly O
across O
the O
nation O
you O
can O
hear O
it O
and O
feel O
it O
. O

The O
split O
now O
palpable O
. O

There O
's O
and O
among O
partisan O
, O
anger O
. O

Americans B-NORP
remain O
glued O
to O
their O
television O
sets O
, O
but O
no O
answer O
is O
coming O
out O
and O
even O
Cuba B-GPE
remarked O
tonight B-TIME
in O
an O
official O
statement O
that O
it O
sure O
is O
taking O
America B-GPE
a O
long O
time O
to O
pick O
a O

Odd O
pairings O
tonight O
at O
the B-FAC
White I-FAC
House I-FAC
when O
all O
the O
nation O
's O
living O
presidents O
except O
Reagan B-PERSON
were O
together O
at O
the O
White O
House O
celebrating O
the O
200th B-ORDINAL
anniversary O
of O
the O
grand O
house O
. O

There O
was O
George B-PERSON
W. I-PERSON
Bush I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
dad O
alongside O
the O
President O
tonight B-TIME
for O
a O
photo O

We O
have O
correspondents O
tonight B-TIME
. O

First B-ORDINAL
to O
the O
Florida B-GPE
capital O
and O
legal O
correspondent O
Dan B-PERSON
Abrams I-PERSON
in O
Tallahassee B-GPE
. O

Brian B-PERSON
, O
this O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
when O
we O
were O
going O
to O
have O
a O
final O
decision O
, O
we O
were O
going O
to O
know O
what O
is O
the O
result O
of O
the O
recount O
in O
Florida B-GPE
. O

Not O
to O
be O
the O
case O
. O

The O
official O
results O
showing O
only O
53 B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
67 B-CARDINAL
counties O
have O
issued O
their O
recount O
results O
and O
provided O
them O
to O
the O
state O
government O
here O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
as O
you O
reported O
just B-TIME
a I-TIME
moment I-TIME
ago I-TIME
, O
the B-ORG
Associated I-ORG
Press I-ORG
reporting O
that O
65 B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
67 B-CARDINAL
counties O
have O
reported O
. O

The O
problem O
is O
the O
numbers O
are O
so O
very O
different O
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
you O
have O
the B-ORG
Associated I-ORG
Press I-ORG
saying O
225 B-CARDINAL
- O
vote O
difference O
after O
65 B-CARDINAL
counties O
. O

You O
have O
the O
officials O
here O
saying O
after O
53 B-CARDINAL
counties O
, O
exactly O
the O
same O
number O
difference O
that O
it O
was O
when O
the O
recount O
began O
, O
1,784 O
, O
and O
if O
you O
watch O
the O
way O
these O
numbers O
have O
been O
coming O
in O
, O
the O
Associated B-ORG
Press I-ORG
numbers O
have O
constantly O
made O
it O
closer O
and O
closer O
, O
Gore B-PERSON
gaining O
ground O
on O
Bush B-PERSON
with O
almost O
every O
county O
's O
result O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
official O
numbers O
that O
have O
been O
coming O
in O
keep O
seesawing O
. O

Bush B-PERSON
gets O
a O
few O
more O
, O
Gore B-PERSON
gets O
a O
few O
more O
and O
we O
're O
back O
to O
even O
again O
, O
according O
to O
state O
officials O
. O

So O
when O
we O
get O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
remaining O
counties O
will O
that O
be O
the O
best O
number O
going O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
to O
be O
the O
best O
number O
. O

I O
just O
ca O
n't O
believe O
these O
numbers O
are O
going O
to O
end O
up O
matching O
at O
the O
end O
. O

MSNBC B-ORG

Because O
as O
A.P. B-ORG
has O
continued O
with O
its O
numbers O
the O
progression O
has O
been O
consistent O
. O

Every O
time O
they O
gave O
you O
a O
set O
of O
counties O
that O
have O
been O
evaluated O
, O
Gore B-PERSON
was O
getting O
closer O
and O
closer O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
with O
every O
group O
of O
counties O
reporting O
officially O
it O
remained O
about O
even O
. O

So O
in O
the O
end O
, O
Brian B-PERSON
, O
I O
think O
the O
official O
numbers O
will O
be O
the O
numbers O
that O
apply O
but O
we O
'll O
have O
to O
wait O
and O
see O
when O
all O
67 B-CARDINAL
are O
counted O
by O
both O
. O

Thank O
you O
for O
that O
. O

And O
there O
are O
still O
several B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
absentee O
votes O
. O

We O
are O
joined O
by O
the O
Reverend O
Jesse B-PERSON
Jackson I-PERSON
. O

Reverend O
Jackson B-PERSON
, O
we O
heard O
a O
report O
earlier O
this O
evening O
that O
the O
Vice O
President O
had O
dispatched O
you O
, O
or O
at O
least O
invited O
you O
to O
help O
in O
the O
Get B-EVENT
Out I-EVENT
the I-EVENT
Vote I-EVENT
effort O
tonight B-TIME
. O

Is O
that O
true O
? O

Well O
, O
not O
just O
tonight B-TIME
. O

Over O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
few I-DATE
months I-DATE
gone O
about O
50 B-CARDINAL
stops O
around O
the O
country O
. O

We O
did O
massive O
voter O
registration O
, O
then O
Get B-EVENT
Out I-EVENT
the I-EVENT
Vote I-EVENT
efforts O
. O

I O
think O
we O
were O
along O
with O
the O
NAACP B-ORG
and O
others O
, O
worked O
on O
the O
Get B-EVENT
your I-EVENT
Souls I-EVENT
to I-EVENT
the I-EVENT
Polls I-EVENT
on O
the O
one O
hand O
and O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
Stay O
out O
of O
the O
Bushes O
and O
it O
worked O
. O

Do O
you O
know O
anything O
we O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
because O
so O
far O
we O
have O
a O
tight O
race O
here O
? O

A O
tight O
race O
but O
fact O
of O
the O
matter O
is O
that O
Jeb B-PERSON
Bush I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
anti-affirmative O
action O
action O
in O
Florida B-GPE
solidified O
women O
and O
people O
of O
color O
and O
basically O
we O
won O
Florida B-GPE
, O
thanks O
to O
Jeb B-PERSON
Bush I-PERSON
. O

Our O
vote O
in O
Michigan B-GPE
, O
we O
have O
done O
about B-DATE
10 I-DATE
days I-DATE
of O
solid O
work O
across O
Michigan B-GPE
. O

Workers O
fighting O
for O
right O
to O
organize O
and O
women O
fighting O
for O
-- O
and O
blacks O
together O
. O

I O
think O
when O
Bush B-PERSON
made O
it O
clear O
that O
he O
wants O
a O
strict O
constructionist O
court O
led O
by O
Scalia B-PERSON
, O
attacked O
affirmative O
action O
, O
attack O
of O
women O
's O
rights O
, O
point O
this O
strong O
ideological O
line O
is O
shown O
in O
these O
vote O
totals O
tonight B-TIME
so O
far O
. O

Reverend O
Jackson B-PERSON
, O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
said O
, O
however O
late O
we O
're O
at O
this O
tonight B-TIME
, O
and O
whoever O
wins O
it O
, O
that O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
so O
thin O
, O
so O
narrow O
, O
that O
it O
will O
be O
a O
victory O
without O
mandate O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
think O
what O
it O
means O
is O
that O
we O
must O
then O
deal O
with O
some O
consensus O
issues O
. O

For O
example O
, O
should O
there O
not O
be O
a O
consensus O
that O
Social B-ORG
Security I-ORG
should O
be O
kept O
secure O
and O
not O
risked O
in O
the O
marketplace O
? O

Should O
we O
not O
make O
a O
commitment O
to O
educate O
all O
of O
our O
children O
, O
not O
just O
vouchers O
for O
a O
few O
of O
them O
? O

Maybe O
something O
as O
basic O
as O
comprehensive O
health O
insurance O
. O

42 B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
Americans B-NORP
have O
no O
health O
insurance O
. O

many O
Americans B-NORP
die O
every B-DATE
day I-DATE
from O
cancer O
. O

Amounts O
to O
a O
vast O
majority O
of O
the O
American B-NORP
people O
. O

Reverend O

very O
much O
