: O
For O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
, O
the O

Early O

since O

The O

One B-CARDINAL
is O
to O

the O
other O
is O

the O

, O
which O
specializes O
in O
Pacific B-LOC
Island I-LOC
tours O
, O
says O
that O
the O
current O
trend O
among O
travelers O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
is O
for O
low O
group O
fares O
with O
lots O
of O
entertainment O
provided O
. O

Most O
people O
who O
go O
on O
island O
vacations O
are O
looking O
for O
pure O
recreation O
, O
so O
they O
would O
prefer O
to O
be O
somewhere O
where O
the O
facilities O
are O
more O
developed O
. O

Though O
Palau B-GPE
is O
rich O
in O
natural O
attractions O
, O
it O
lacks O
peripheral O
tourist O
facilities O
like O
pubs O
, O
shopping O
centers O
, O
and O
gift O
shops O
, O
so O
naturally O
the O
islands O
are O
less O
attractive O
. O

Despite O
all O
this O
, O
James B-PERSON
Yeh I-PERSON
notes O
that O
the O
rate O
of O
return O
visitors O
to O
Palau B-GPE
is O
very O
high O
, O
more B-PERCENT
than I-PERCENT
30 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
. O

Clearly O
the O
island O
is O
still O
very O
appealing O
. O

If O
the O
problems O
of O
high O
group O
rates O
and O
inadequate O
facilities O
can O
be O
solved O
, O
there O
is O
enormous O
potential O
yet O
in O
Palau B-GPE
. O

The O
Palauan B-NORP
government O
is O
working O
hard O
to O
eliminate O
obstacles O
to O
solving O
the O
above O
problems O
. O

going O
forward O
on O
a O

They O

In O

, O
the O

to O
raise O

In O
the O
current O
wave O
of O
interest O

in O

, O
the O

is O
also O
getting O
attention O

Currently O
, O
there O

only O
one O

in O
the O
fishing O
industry O
in O
Palau B-GPE
- O
Tai B-PERSON
Jung I-PERSON

fei I-PERSON
- O
so O
profits O
are O
quite O
good O
. O

" O
At O
first O
I O
was O
in O
business O
with O
a O
bunch O
of O
friends O
, O
and O
we O
rented O
eight O
fishing O
boats O
, O
but O
profits O
were O
only O
ordinary O
. O

After O
my O
friends O
pulled O
out O
of O
the O
operation O
, O
I O
switched O
over O
to O
mainly O
running O
a O
base O
for O
fishing O
boats O
. O
" O

Little O
did O
he O
expect O
that O
profits O
would O
be O
much O
larger O
, O
especially O
after O
the O
company O
acquired O
local O
fishing O
rights O
for O
75 B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

During O
the O
peak O
season O
from O
May B-DATE
to I-DATE
October I-DATE
, O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
ten I-CARDINAL
tuna O
ships O
come O
in O
every O
day O
to O
offload O
their O
catch O
and O
to O
resupply O
. O

These O
days O
, O
Tai B-PERSON

Palau B-ORG
Marine I-ORG

covers O
an O
area O
of O
1.5 B-QUANTITY
acres I-QUANTITY
and O
employs O
more B-CARDINAL

40 I-CARDINAL
staff O
. O

It O
offers O
advanced O

two B-CARDINAL

guaranteeing O
to O

the O

within O
24 B-TIME

However O
, O
though O
Tai B-PERSON
has O
made O
quite O
a O
name O
for O
himself O
with O
his O
business O
, O
this O
does O
not O
necessarily O
mean O
that O
other O
Taiwanese B-NORP

come O

make O
similar O

Company I-ORG
Ltd. I-ORG
, O
which O
operates O
fishing O
boats O
in O
the B-LOC
South I-LOC
Pacific I-LOC
, O
explains O
that O
South B-LOC
Pacific I-LOC
fishing O
is O
divided O
into O
two B-CARDINAL
types O
- O
net O
fishing O
, O
and O
line O
fishing O
of O
tuna O
. O

Palau B-GPE
is O
not O
really O
suited O
to O
the O
former O
, O
because O
its O
territorial O
waters O
are O
not O
large O
, O
so O
the O
catch O
is O
limited O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
tuna O
stocks O
there O
are O
high O
, O
so O
Palau B-GPE
is O
more O
suited O
to O
line O
fishing O
. O

But O
the O
problem O
is O
that O
Tai B-PERSON
Jung I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
fei I-PERSON
is O
already O
running O
a O
tuna O
base O
there O
, O
and O
it O
is O
debatable O
whether O
there O
is O
the O
need O
for O
another O
one O
. O

Koo B-PERSON
warns O
: O
" O
It O
's O
hard O
to O
estimate O
the O
potential O
catch O
. O

If O
there O
were O
several O
firms O
, O
the O
risk O
would O
be O
much O
greater O
. O
" O

In O
addition O
, O
though O
there O
are O
many O
varieties O
of O
fish O
around O
Palau B-GPE
, O
the O
scale O
of O
operations O
is O
small O
, O
and O
markets O
are O
far O
away O
, O
so O
the O
return O
on O
investment O
would O
not O
necessarily O
be O
very O
high O
. O

Koo B-PERSON
points O
instead O
to O
a O
different O
option O
: O
The O
waters O
around O
Palau B-GPE
are O
clear O
and O
warm O
, O
which O
makes O
them O
suited O
to O
aquaculture O
. O

So O
far O
, O
returns O
from O
the O
small O
- O
scale O
aquaculture O
of O
scallops O
have O
been O
decent O
. O

Koo B-PERSON
cautions O
, O
however O
, O
that O
" O
if O
you O
want O
to O
invest O
, O
you O
have O
to O
go O
large O
- O
scale O
, O
because O
after O
all O
Palau B-GPE
is O
far O
from O
the O
main O
markets O
. O

In O
1986 B-DATE
, O
Palau B-GPE
, O
like O
many O
former O
American B-NORP
- O
controlled O

, O
signed O
a B-LAW
" I-LAW

The O
agreement O
allows O

tax O
- O
free O
, O
and O
there O
are O
no O

for O
such O
things O
as O

. O

For O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
a O
major O
producer O
of O
textiles O
and O

, O
this O
is O
a O
very O
strong O
investment O

. O

Currently O
Japanese B-NORP
and O
Taiwanese B-NORP
business O
people O
are O
negotiating O
with O
the O
Palauan B-NORP
government O
to O
establish O
a B-GPE
Palau I-GPE
Free I-GPE

Zone I-GPE
. O

The O
idea O
is O
for O
Palau B-GPE
to O
designate O
a O
special O
zone O
for O
economic O
development O
, O
with O
the O
Palau B-GPE
government O
providing O
tax O
and O

The O
zone O
would O
be O
for O
processing O
of O
exports O

mainly O
in O

very O
familiar O
with O
the O

climate O
in O

. O

He O
says O
that O
right O
now O
the O
main O
obstacles O
to O
foreign O
investment O
are O
land O
acquisition O
and O
communications O
. O

Under O
Palauan B-NORP
law O
foreigners O
are O
not O
allowed O
to O
own O
land O
there O
, O
but O
can O
only O
lease O
land O
for O
development O
. O

The O
longest O
permitted O
lease O
is O
50 B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

But O
even O
leasing O
is O
a O
complicated O
matter O
, O
because O
traditionally O
land O
in O
Palau B-GPE
is O
owned O
jointly O
by O
the O
family O
and O
the O
clan O
. O

Moreover O
, O
communications O
and O
Internet O
access O
are O
not O
very O
reliable O

All O
of O
these O
problems O
deter O
investors O
. O

Though O
the O
communications O
problems O
may O
be O
resolved O
within O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE

- O
the O

" O
be O
prudent O

" O

" O
The O
point O
to O
watch O
out O
for O
in O
the O
whole O
plan O
is O
that O
Taiwan B-GPE
firms O
may O
not O
understand O
that O
it O
might O
not O
be O
all O
that O
good O
a O
deal O
from O
the O
point O

of O
the O
Palau B-GPE
authorities O
, O
" O
he O
says O

Currently O
foreign O
firms O
are O
more O
pro-active O
than O
the O
Palauan B-NORP
government O
, O
which O
has O
its O
own O
concerns O
: O
The O
indigenous O
population O
is O
small O

and O
there O
could O
be O
social O
problems O
if O
a O
large O
number O
of O
foreign O
workers O
come O
to O
the O
islands O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
government O
must O
weigh O
economic O
development O
against O
environmental O
destruction O
. O

" O
The O
terms O
under O
which O
Palau B-GPE
would O
accept O
the O
proposed O

may O
not O
be O
as O
good O
as O

there O

The O

In O

the O

By O

the O
carefully O

it O
is O

that O

all O
afraid O

out O

" O

The O
only O
exception O

who O
is O
well O

known O
for O

But O
neither O

about O

But O
, O
in O
an O

moment O

Chen B-PERSON

declared O
" O
Long O

and O
this O
comment O
has O
left O
many O
people O
uncertain O
which O
is O
the O
real O
Chen B-PERSON

Independent O
candidate O

James B-PERSON
Soong I-PERSON
has O
suggested O
defining O
Taiwan B-GPE

links O
as O
a O

" O

This O
aims O

that O

appeal O

Taiwan B-GPE
, O
mainland O
China B-GPE
, O
and O
the O
international O
community O
. O

But O
this O
idea O
has O
been O
criticized O
for O
unilaterally O
reducing O
Taiwan B-GPE
to O
the O
status O
of O
a O

quasi-country O
, O
" O
thereby O
weakening O

somewhat O

" O

states O
formula O
. O
" O

After O
much O
consideration O
, O
his O
mainland O
policy O
has O
been O
framed O
as O
working O
toward O
the O
middle O
stage O

" O
No O

on O

" O
says O
Wang B-PERSON

This O
is O
because O
over O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
few I-DATE

a O
consensus O
has O
taken O

in O

" O

No O

has O
the O
ability O
to O
alter O
this O

The O
candidates O
can O
merely O
haggle O

Alexander B-PERSON
Lu I-PERSON
, O
a O
professor O

National B-ORG

, O
agrees O
with O
the O
no O
- O
major O
- O
innovations O
approach O
of O
the O
three B-CARDINAL
candidates O
. O

As O
he O
sees O
it O
, O
since O
currently O
there O
are O
three B-CARDINAL
candidates O
with O
a O
roughly O
equal O
share O
of O
the O
vote O
, O
whoever O
wins O
will O
probably O
not O
get O
more B-PERCENT
than I-PERCENT
50 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
there O
will O
be O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
countervailing O
pressure O
against O
radical O
change O
. O

Concludes O
Lu B-PERSON
: O
" O
Policy O
will O
tend O
to O
be O
centrist O
, O
and O
any O
steps O
taken O
will O
be O
small O
. O
" O

He O
adds O
, O
" O
Taiwan B-GPE
is O
a O
pluralistic O
society O
, O
and O
if O
you O
want O
to O
attract O
many O
types O
of O
voters O
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
be O
too O
outspoken O
about O
policy O
. O

This O
is O
because O
extreme O
clarity O
does O
n't O
make O
much O
difference O
to O
those O
who O
already O
support O
you O
, O
but O
it O
could O
cost O
you O
undecided O
votes O

" O

Local O
issues O
, O
national O

Mainland O
policy O
is O
a O
minefield O
, O
but O
it O
is O
the O
foundation O
for O
all O
other O
policies O
, O
and O
no O
candidate O
can O
ignore O
it O
. O

However O
, O
this O
does O
not O
mean O
, O
say O
Wang B-PERSON
and O
Lu B-PERSON
, O
that O
it O
will O
be O
a O
decisive O
factor O
in O
the O
election O
. O

" O
There O
is O
a O
very O
curious O
aspect O
to O
Taiwan B-GPE

electoral O
culture O
, O
" O
explains O
Wang B-PERSON
. O

Taiwan B-GPE
is O
small O
, O
and O
voters O
do O
not O
clearly O
distinguish O
between O
the O
roles O
of O
the O
head O
of O
state O
, O
elected O
legislators O
, O
and O
government O
bureaucrats O
. O

No O
matter O
how O
high O
the O
office O
, O
for O
many O
voters O
, O
especially O
in O
traditional O
constituencies O
, O
" O
all O
politics O
is O
local O
. O
" O

For O
them O
, O
what O
matters O
is O
whether O
a O
politician O
seems O
concerned O
about O
their O
hometown O
issues O
. O

That O
is O
why O
when O
Chen B-PERSON

bian I-PERSON
went O
to O
Sanhsia B-GPE
in O
Taipei B-GPE

to O
Kaohsiung B-GPE
he O
talked O
about O
establishing O
a O
science O

industrial O
park O
there O
. O

These O
parochial O
issues O
are O
the O
real O
keys O
to O
the O

Next O
in O

that O

over O

goes O
back O
to O
the O
days O

When O
Soong B-PERSON

KMT B-ORG

he O
was O
powerful O
and O
aloof O
; O
the O
only O
way O

In O

several O
such O

For O

he O
criticized O

over O
the O

and O
also O
over O

in O
the O

His O

were O
such O
that O
" O
he O
only O

He O

a O

Chen B-PERSON
acted O

and O
, O
step O
by O

, O
has O
become O
the O
most O
popular O
figure O
in O
the O
DPP B-ORG
. O

As O
a O
legislator O
, O
Chen B-PERSON
was O
a O
sharp O
questioner O
of O

officials O
, O
but O
he O
had O
a O
little O
trouble O
adjusting O

being O
an O

official O
himself O
. O

As O
Taipei B-GPE
mayor O
, O
his O
decisiveness O
won O
many O
plaudits O
, O
but O
his O
manner O
was O
often O
perceived O

this O
led O

" O
Chen B-PERSON
fulfilled O

As O
Wang B-PERSON
puts O
it O

" O
Perhaps O

say O
that O
many O

whether O

that O

platforms O
, O
the O
incumbent O
, O
Lien B-PERSON
Chan I-PERSON
, O
is O
at O
a O

because O
the O

scrutiny O

According O
to O
Ting B-PERSON
, O
" O
Lien B-PERSON
Chan I-PERSON
has O
been O
at O
odds O
with O
the O
education O
community O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O
" O

Reformers O
are O
most O
disappointed O
that O
the O

budget O
has O
been O
seriously O
squeezed O
these B-DATE
past I-DATE

falling O
by O

40 I-MONEY

a B-DATE

" O
Lien B-PERSON
is O
also O
the O
candidate O
who O
is O
most O
likely O
to O
believe O
that O

be O
solved O
by O
throwing O
money O
at O
them O

" O

to O

These O
would O
all O

The O

Ting B-PERSON
concludes O
: O
" O
He O
has O
lost O
his O
direction O
in O
terms O
of O
education O
policy O
, O
and O
he O
underestimates O
the O
education O
community O
. O

He O
thinks O
he O
just O
has O
to O
promise O
to O
throw O
money O
around O
and O
then O
he O
'll O
have O
people O
persuaded O

" O

Educators O
are O
not O
looking O
to O
be O
a O
burden O
on O
the O
country O
; O
all O
they O
want O
is O
that O
the O

stop O
squeezing O

smaller O

smaller O

In O
fact O
, O
the O

closely O

about O
the O
roles O

" O
Just O
as O
wool O
grows O
on O

if O

that O

it O

states O
: O
" O
All O
candidates O
have O
beautiful O

sounding O
platforms O

because O
this O

a O
presidential O
election O

and O
they O
must O
have O
a O
blueprint O
for O

the O

But O
running O
for O
office O
and O
running O
the O
country O
are O
two B-CARDINAL
very O
different O
things O
. O
" O

It O
has O
been O
said O
, O
" O
campaigning O
is O
like O
poetry O
, O
governing O
is O
like O
an O
essay O

" O

In O
writing O
a O
poem O
, O
one O
can O
create O
a O
coherent O
and O
highly O
refined O
work O

But O
it O
is O
only O
actual O
governing O
that O
tests O
one O

true O

Scholars O
have O
stated O
that O
the O
2000 B-DATE
election O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
has O
three B-CARDINAL
special O
characteristics O
: O

For O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
, O
this O
is O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
the O
opposition O
has O
a O
very O
real O
possibility O
of O
taking O
the O
reins O
of O
government O
. O

Secondly B-ORDINAL
, O
the O
three B-CARDINAL
leading O
candidates O
are O
so O
close O
it O
is O
impossible O
to O
tell O
who O
will O
win O
. O

And O
third B-ORDINAL
, O
whatever O
the O
outcome O
, O
this O
is O
the O
beginning O
of O
Taiwan B-GPE

post-strongman O
era O
. O

In O
this O
new O
era O
, O
says O
Wang B-PERSON
, O
new O
standards O
for O
leadership O
are O
needed O
. O

The O
national O
leader O
must O
be O
more O
than O
just O
a O
local O
politico O
writ O
large O
. O

Wang B-PERSON
gives O
his O
personal O
analysis O
of O
the O
pros O
and O
cons O
for O
the O
three B-CARDINAL
candidates O
: O

Chen B-PERSON
Shui I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
bian I-PERSON
is O
the O
person O
who O
brings O
the O
most O
hope O
and O
vitality O
, O
because O
his O
policies O
would O
be O
clearly O
different O
from O
those O
of O
the O
KMT B-ORG
. O

But O
his O
biggest O
problem O
is O
" O
instability O
" O
- O
not O
personal O
instability O
, O
but O
policy O
instability O
. O

For O
example O
, O
sometimes O
he O
seems O
opposed O
to O
allowing O
PRC B-GPE
firms O
to O
invest O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
sometimes O
in O
favor O
; O
sometimes O
he O
seems O
against O
the O
opening O
of O
direct O
links O
with O
the O
mainland O
, O
sometimes O
not O
. O

James B-PERSON
Soong I-PERSON
is O
very O
capable O
, O
but O
his O
very O
success O
may O
be O
his O
weak O
point O
. O

He O
is O
often O
very O
proud O
of O
himself O
because O
his O
provincial O
administration O
built O
a O
bridge O
or O
aqueduct O
to O
meet O
the O
needs O
of O
ordinary O
people O
. O

But O
, O
ancient O
Chinese B-NORP
governing O
wisdom O
criticizes O
those O
who O
" O
accomplish O
a O
small O
feat O
and O
think O
they O
can O
do O
anything O
, O
or O
discover O
a O
trivial O
idea O
and O
think O
they O
are O
brilliant O
. O
" O

Lien B-PERSON
Chan I-PERSON
offers O
stability O
above O
all O
. O

But O
he O
carries O
a O
heavy O
burden O
. O

Lien B-PERSON
must O
face O
up O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
his O
party O

been O

in O
Taiwan B-GPE
for O
50 B-DATE

and O
people O
want O

Political O

Alexander B-PERSON

that O
the O

If O

it O

not O

" O
Crime O

He O

that O

the O

: O

" O
If O
students O
can O
enjoy O

then O
society O
will O
no O

" O

Ting B-PERSON
says O
that O
, O
although O
education O
is O
not O
a O
panacea O
, O
it O
is O
certainly O
not O
irrelevant O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
effects O
of O
education O
policy O
are O
visible O
only O
in O
the O
long O
term O
, O
and O
it O
therefore O
has O
a O
relatively O
weak O
position O
in O
politics O
and O
is O
often O
neglected O
because O
policymakers O
probably O
will O
not O
see O
the O
fruits O
of O
their O
efforts O
in O
their O
terms O
of O
office O
. O

But O
the O
main O
industries O
of O
the B-DATE
21st I-DATE
century I-DATE
, O
such O
as O
the O
information O
and O
telecommunications O
industries O
, O
are O
knowledge O
- O
based O
. O

If O
education O
is O
done O
well O
, O
the O
benefits O
will O
spread O
to O
many O
other O
areas O
. O

The O
greatest O
variable O
for O
Taiwan B-GPE
society O
remains O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the B-LOC
Taiwan I-LOC
Strait I-LOC
. O

" O
In O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
two I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
Taiwan B-GPE
has O
been O
continually O
testing O
where O
mainland O
China B-GPE
will O
draw O
the O
line O
in O
cross-strait O
relations O
, O
" O
says O
social O
critic O
Nan B-PERSON
Fang I-PERSON
Shuo I-PERSON
. O

But O
playing O
word O
games O
over O
how O
to O
define O
the O
relationship O
is O
simply O
a O
way O
of O
hiding O
from O
the O
problem O
, O
ostrich O
- O
like O
, O
as O
the O
situation O
deteriorates O
. O

Fortunately O
the O
three B-CARDINAL
main O

have O
committed O
themselves O
to O
a O
moderate O
path O

Right O
now O
there O
's O
a O
choice O
between O
peace O
and O
war O
in O
cross-strait O

. O

The O
most O
important O
challenge O
for O
Taiwan B-GPE
now O
is O
to O
transcend O
the O

Having O
a O

Gao B-PERSON
in O

, O
TIBE B-EVENT
visitors O
naturally O
focused O
on O
his O
artistic O
vision O
and O
creative O
process O
. O

In O
a O
speech O
presented O
at O
the O
exhibition O
, O
Gao B-PERSON
stated O
that O
over O
the O
course O
of O
decades O
of O
writing O
, O
he O
has O
given O
ever O
- O
greater O
attention O
to O
the O
heart O
of O
literature O
- O
the O
art O
of O
language O
. O

To O
Gao B-PERSON
, O
the O
only O
standard O
for O
judging O
literature O
is O
the O
beauty O
of O
its O
language O
, O
and O
language O
itself O
is O
a O
means O
of O
getting O
at O
" O
reality O
. O
" O

Gao B-PERSON
refers O
to O
his O
own O
approach O
to O
writing O
as O
" O
stream O
- O
of O
- O
language O
" O
and O
believes O
that O
writers O
who O
seek O
a O
vivid O
, O
modern O
Chinese B-NORP
face O
an O
extremely O
difficult O
path O
. O

Gao B-PERSON
also O
revealed O
that O
to O
ensure O
that O
his O
own O
writing O
remains O
fresh O
and O
lively O
, O
he O
first O
speaks O
his O
thoughts O
into O
a O
recorder O
before O
later O
recasting O
them O
in O
a O
written O
form O
. O

Gao B-PERSON
Xingjian I-PERSON
feels O
that O
writing O
is O
an O
extremely O
personal O
pursuit O
, O
that O
its O
starting O
point O
is O
a O
quest O
for O
personal O
values O
. O

If O
a O
writer O
is O
to O
produce O
good O
work O
, O
he O
must O
cast O
aside O
political O
and O
social O
missions O
, O
disregard O
the O
opinions O
of O
readers O
and O
the O
market O
, O
and O
instead O
must O
write O
spontaneously O
, O
listening O
carefully O
to O
the O
faintest O
, O
most O
honest O
voice O
in O
his O
heart O
. O

Considering O
that O
Gao B-PERSON
fled O
a O
tyrannical O
government O
to O
become O
an O
expatriate O
, O
many O
people O
wonder O
whether O
Gao B-PERSON
's O
literature O
insists O
upon O
humanitarianism O
and O
high O
principles O
. O

But O
Gao B-PERSON
feels O
that O
literature O
is O
above O
politics O
and O
should O
not O
serve O
it O
. O

Further O
, O
literature O
should O
not O
be O
limited O
by O
morals O
, O
ethics O
or O
public O
sentiment O
. O

In O
Gao B-PERSON
's O
view O
, O
20th B-DATE
century I-DATE
literature O
too O
often O
emphasized O
" O
literary O
revolution O
" O
or O
was O
" O
revolutionary O
literature O
. O
" O

It O
was O
too O
often O
tied O
to O
a O
preposterous O
sense O
of O
mission O
which O
took O
literature O
with O
it O
to O
the O
grave O
. O

As O
Gao B-PERSON
said O
at O
the O
Nobel B-WORK_OF_ART
Prize I-WORK_OF_ART
awards O
ceremony O
, O
Communist B-NORP
rule O
stymied O
the O
development O
of O
mainland O
Chinese B-NORP
literature O
. O

Not O
surprisingly O
, O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
Communists B-NORP
were O
critical O
of O
the O
selection O
of O
Gao B-PERSON
as O
a O
Nobel O
Laureate O
, O
labeling O
his O
choice O
an O
" O
imperialist O
conspiracy O
" O
and O
another O
" O
insult O
to O
all O
Chinese B-NORP
" O
by O
the O
West B-LOC
. O

This O
standoff O
between O
the O
Nobel O
laureate O
and O
his O
cultural O
motherland O
adds O
a O
note O
of O
regret O
to O
the O
joy O
of O

around O

Gao B-PERSON
has O
touched O
off O
another O
interesting O
debate O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
- O
one O
on O
the O
competing O
desires O
of O
the O
spirit O
and O
the O

. O

Discussing O
Gao B-PERSON
together O
with O
former O
Japanese B-NORP
porn O
star O
Iijima B-PERSON
Ai I-PERSON
causes O
many O
cultural O
critics O
to O
shake O
their O
heads O
, O
but O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
writers O
' O
works O
are O
not O
that O
dissimilar O
. O

While O
Soul B-WORK_OF_ART
Mountain I-WORK_OF_ART
describes O
one O
man O
's O
spiritual O
journey O
, O
it O
also O
contains O
numerous O
graphic O
descriptions O
of O
sexual O
desire O
. O

Similarly O
, O
Ai B-PERSON
's O
book O
on O
the O
flesh O
actually O
expresses O
her O
longing O
for O
spiritual O
love O
. O

These O
two B-CARDINAL
works O
remind O
us O
that O
the O
spirit O
and O
the O
flesh O
are O
both O
aspects O
of O
being O
human O
and O
that O
the O
distance O
between O
these O
two B-CARDINAL
" O
opposing O

" O
is O
not O
as O
great O
as O

" O
where O
there O
is O
an O
exhibit O
that O
seems O
quite O
out O
of O
the O
ordinary O
: O
rough O
sandy O
earth O
, O
an O
upright O
measuring O

. O
. O
. O
it O
is O
more O
like O
the O
site O
of O
an O
archeological O

. O

The O
layers O
of O
prehistoric O
pottery O
represent O
different O
cultures O
that O
existed O
at O
various O
times O
in O

It O
is O
almost O
impossible O
to O
tell O
that O
these O
rudimentary O

beautiful O
works O
of O

not O

It O
is O
especially O
fitting O
that O
they O
should O
be O
Cheng B-PERSON

work O

because O
this O
unusual O

Let O

But O
the O
most O
important O
reason O
why O
the B-ORG
Yingko I-ORG
Ceramics I-ORG
Museum I-ORG
gave O
him O
sole O
and O
total O
control O
over O
the O
recreation O
of O
the O
36 B-CARDINAL
pieces O
of O
prehistoric O
pottery O
in O
the O
exhibit O
is O
this O
: O
He O
is O
the O
only O
leading O
ceramicist O
in O
all O
of O
Taiwan B-GPE
who O
also O
graduated O
from O
university O
with O
a O
degree O
in O
archeology O
. O

A O
great O
deal O
of O
effort O
has O
been O
devoted O
to O
opening O
new O
museums O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
in O
recent B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

Besides O
institutions O
devoted O
to O
the O
natural O
sciences O
, O
the O
main O
focus O
has O
been O
on O
local O
Taiwanese B-NORP
history O
and O
aboriginal O
culture O
. O

Examples O
include O
the B-ORG
National I-ORG
Museum I-ORG
of I-ORG
Prehistory I-ORG
, O
Taipei B-GPE
County I-GPE
's I-GPE
Yingko B-ORG
Ceramics I-ORG
Museum I-ORG
and O
Shihsanhang B-ORG
Museum I-ORG
, O
and O
the O
privately O
founded O
Sheng B-ORG
Ye I-ORG
Museum I-ORG
of I-ORG
Formosan I-ORG
Aborigines I-ORG
. O

For O
museums O
, O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
is O
of O
course O
to O
acquire O
items O
to O
display O
. O

But O
most O
archeological O
artifacts O
are O
only O
shards O
, O
and O
the O
few O
items O
that O
have O
been O
found O
intact O
are O
jealously O
guarded O
by O
the O
institutions O
that O
dug O
them O
up O
; O
they O
are O
rarely O
lent O
out O
. O

Thus O
the B-ORG
Yingko I-ORG
Ceramics I-ORG
Museum I-ORG
's I-ORG
only O
option O
was O
to O
find O
someone O
to O
make O
copies O
of O
the O
originals O
. O

This O
was O
vital O
because O
, O
during O
the O
planning O
stage O
for O
the O
museum O
, O
it O
was O
decided O
to O
establish O
a O
very O
special O
room O
to O
be O
called O
" B-WORK_OF_ART

. O
" O

" O
We O
felt O
that O
Taiwan B-GPE
ceramics O
should O
cover O
more O
than O
just O
what O
Han B-NORP
Chinese B-NORP
people O
have O
done O
in O
the B-DATE
400 I-DATE
years I-DATE
since O
large O
- O
scale O
migration O
began O
from O
the O
mainland O
, O
but O
should O
also O
include O
aboriginal O
and O
prehistoric O
pottery O
. O

But O
it O
is O
quite O
a O
challenge O
to O
effectively O
create O
such O
a O
comprehensive O
display O
, O
especially O
since O
authentic O
pieces O
are O
so O
hard O
to O
come O
by O
. O
" O

Lu B-PERSON

that O
most O
of O
the O
genuine O

Hung O
up O
on O
red O

The O
museum O
sent O
a O
written O
request O
to O
NTU B-ORG
asking O
to O
borrow O
samples O
from O
which O
copies O
could O
be O
made O
, O
but O
that O
idea O
quickly O
hit O
the O
shoals O
. O

NTU B-ORG
's O
archeology O
departmental O
affairs O
committee O
decided O
that O
the O
museum O
should O
have O
first B-ORDINAL
submitted O
a O
cooperation O
proposal O
prior O
to O
asking O
for O
any O
loans O
. O

Lu B-PERSON
Hsiu I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chin I-PERSON
says O
with O
exasperation O
: O
" O
This O
was O
not O
an O
unreasonable O
request O
. O

But O
by O
that O
point O
we O
had O
no O
time O
to O
lose O
, O
and O
it O
would O
have O
been O
problematic O
to O
file O
a O
retroactive O
proposal O
. O
" O

After O
asking O
around O
, O
the O
museum O
found O
an O
old O
gent O
- O
a O
specialist O
in O
making O
fiberglass O
reproductions O
of O
old O
artifacts O
- O
who O
had O
done O
similar O
work O
for O
the B-ORG
National I-ORG
Museum I-ORG
of I-ORG
Prehistory I-ORG
. O

But O
when O
Lu B-PERSON
examined O
the O
finished O
products O
, O
though O
the O
shapes O
were O
super O
, O
the O
reproductions O
did O
n't O
capture O
the O
texture O
of O
the O
original O
visually O
, O
much O
less O
when O
picked O
up O
in O
the O
hand O
. O

At O
this O
point O
, O
Lu B-PERSON
had O
little O
choice O
but O
to O
turn O
for O
help O
to O
Liu B-PERSON

, O
a O

fellow O
at O

Liu B-PERSON
I I-PERSON

chang I-PERSON
is O
renowned O
in O
the O
archeological O
community O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
for O
his O
field O

He O
has O
done O
the O
initial O
field O
work O
on O
dozens B-CARDINAL
of O
important O
sites O
, O
including O
Shihsanhang B-NORP
, O
Tachuwei B-NORP

and O
Peiyeh B-NORP

His O
ambition O
is O
to O
uncover O
the O
relationship O
between O
Taiwan B-GPE
's O
indigenous O
peoples O
and O
its O
prehistoric O
cultures O
. O

He O
is O
also O
the O
one O
who O
was O
asked O
to O
select O
the O
36 B-CARDINAL
prehistoric O
pottery O
samples O
to O
be O
displayed O
at O
the B-ORG

In O
love O
with O

Lu B-PERSON
asked O
Liu B-PERSON
for O
advice O
about O
people O
qualified O
to O
do O
reproductions O
of O
ancient O
pottery O
. O

She O
hit O
the O
jackpot O
, O
because O
Liu B-PERSON
happened O
to O
have O
a O
good O
friend O
named O
Cheng B-PERSON
Yung I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
gwo I-PERSON
, O
a O

, O
who O

studied O
in O
the B-ORG

at O
NTU B-ORG

" O
Cheng B-PERSON
was O
three B-DATE
years I-DATE
behind O
me O
in O
school O
, O
and O
we O
worked O
together O
on O
digs O
for O
many B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

When O
he O
was O
in O
college O
, O
he O
worked O
on O
the O
Peinan B-NORP
and O
Chihshanyen B-NORP
sites O
, O
" O
says O
Liu B-PERSON
. O

Peinan B-NORP
society O
had O
highly O
developed O
pottery O
arts O
, O
and O
Chihshanyen B-NORP
is O
a O
multi-layered O
site O
with O
artifacts O
from O
several O
cultures O
, O
and O
the O
pottery O
is O
even O
more O
refined O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
Cheng B-PERSON
's O
inspiration O
for O
ceramics O
originally O
came O
from O
archeology O
. O

Liu B-PERSON
continues O
: O
" O
Though O
later O
Cheng B-PERSON
left O
archeology O
to O
do O
ceramic O
art O
, O
he O
did O
not O
forget O
his O
affection O
for O
prehistoric O
pottery O
, O
and O
his O
early O
work O
was O
influenced O
by O
ancient O
painted O
pottery O
. O
" O

Liu B-PERSON
notes O
that O
in O
recent B-DATE
years I-DATE
there O
has O
been O
growing O
demand O
for O
archeological O
artifacts O
for O
displays O
, O
precisely O
fitting O
with O
Cheng B-PERSON
's O
familiarity O
with O
ceramic O
art O
and O
his O
understanding O
of O
archeological O
work O
. O

As O
Lu B-PERSON
Hsiu I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chin I-PERSON
says O
, O
with O
the O
satisfaction O
that O
comes O
of O
knowing O
one O
has O
got O
just O
what O
one O
wants O
, O
" O
He O
is O
the O
ideal O
person O
to O
do O
reproductions O
of O
prehistoric O
pottery O
. O
" O

A O
ceramicist O
who O
reads O
academic O
papers O

In O
fact O
, O
this O
is O
the O
fourth B-ORDINAL
time O
that O
Cheng B-PERSON
has O
done O
reproductions O
of O
prehistoric O
pottery O
. O

He O
previously O
worked O
on O
special O
exhibitions O
of O
Chihshanyen B-LOC
and O
Yuanshan B-LOC
culture O
and O
also O
for O
the B-ORG
Taiwan I-ORG
Provincial I-ORG
Museum I-ORG
. O

But O
never O
before O
had O
he O
been O
given O
a O
task O
as O
challenging O
as O
making O
reproductions O
representing O
all O
the O
major O
sites O
of O
prehistoric O
pottery O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
. O

In O
the O
process O
of O
making O
his O
recreations O
, O
Cheng B-PERSON
was O
unable O
to O
get O
around O
the O
rigid O
system O
of O
controls O
to O
secure O
any O
original O
samples O
. O

" O
What O
is O
so O
incredible O
about O
Cheng B-PERSON
Yung I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
gwo I-PERSON
is O
that O
he O
only O
looked O
at O
the O
samples O
and O
took O
back O
some O
photographs O
to O
work O
with O
, O
" O
says O
Liu B-PERSON
I I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chang I-PERSON
. O

Take O
for O
example O
the O
human O
- O
faced O
jar O
from O
the O
Shisanhang B-NORP
culture O
. O

The O
visage O
depicted O
on O
the O
piece O
is O
of O
complex O
design O
, O
with O
sharp O
angles O
and O
corners O
. O

For O
the O
work O
to O
be O
faithful O
to O
the O
original O
each O
angle O
had O
to O
be O
precise O
. O

Cheng B-PERSON
tackled O
this O
problem O
by O
assembling O
a O
number O
of O
paper O
models O
before O
getting O
to O
work O
. O

But O
he O
also O
had O
to O
try O
to O
duplicate O
the O
red O
color O
of O
the O
piece O
, O
a O
color O
characteristic O
of O
Shisanhang B-NORP
pottery O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
Cheng B-PERSON
made O
a O
special O
trip O
to O
the B-LOC
Linkou I-LOC
Plateau I-LOC
to O
collect O
red O
clay O
. O

But O
he O
found O
this O
material O
impossible O
to O
get O
into O
the O
right O
shape O
, O
so O
he O
had O
to O
add O
a O
certain O
proportion O
of O
general O
- O
purpose O
potter O
's O
clay O
. O

After O
several O
tries O
, O
he O
settled O
on O
a O
combination O
of O
three B-CARDINAL
parts O
Tachia B-NORP
clay O
to O
one O
part O
Linkou B-NORP
clay O
, O
with O
a O
35 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
ratio O
of O
gravel O
, O
and O

to O
the O
photo O
on O
the O
cover O
of O
the O
brochure O
for O
the O
Shisanhang B-NORP
site O
museum O
, O
he O
testifies O
: O
" O
I O
was O
the O
person O
who O
dug O
up O
the O
original O
, O
so O
I O
should O
know O
- O
the O
color O
in O
the O

is O
not O
right O
, O
while O
Cheng B-PERSON
is O
much O
closer O
to O
the O
real O
thing O
. O
" O

For O
Cheng B-PERSON
, O
the O
hardest O
thing O
was O
the O
facial O
expression O
. O

" O
The O
face O
is O
not O
smiling O
, O
but O
it O
is O
not O
crying O
either O
, O
rather O
it O
looks O
a O
bit O
depressed O
. O
" O

He O
says O
that O
this O
is O
a O
very O
impractical O
piece O
, O
so O
its O
original O
purpose O
was O
probably O
decorative O
or O
ritualistic O
. O

In O
an O
effort O
to O
capture O
the O
ambivalent O
facial O
expression O
, O
he O
imagined O
the O
jar O
as O
a O
bust O
- O
length O
portrait O
of O
a O
woman O
. O

She O
would O
be O
an O
elegantly O
dressed O
noblewoman O
, O
with O
brushed O
hair O
, O
and O
jewelry O
made O
from O
shells O
, O
with O
perhaps O
an O
agate O

" O
During O
his O
days O
as O
a O
student O
, O
" O
says O
Liu B-PERSON
of O
Cheng B-PERSON
, O
" O
he O
did O
hands O
- O
on O
work O
at O
archeological O
sites O
, O
digging O
up O
shards O
, O
observing O
, O
and O
in O
his O
mind O
recreating O
the O
process O
by O
which O
they O
may O
have O
been O
made O
. O

He O
has O
always O
had O
a O
naturally O
deep O
attachment O
to O
archeology O
. O
" O

Liu B-PERSON
says O
that O
this O
is O
probably O
the O
reason O
why O
Cheng B-PERSON
, O
when O
doing O
reproductions O
of O
prehistoric O
pottery O
, O
aims O
to O
capture O
the O
spirit O
of O
the O
originals O
, O
not O
just O
their O
surface O
appearance O
. O

Even O
more O
important O
for O
reproducing O
prehistoric O
artifacts O
is O
good O
detective O
work O
. O

You O
have O
to O
be O
able O
to O
reconstruct O
the O
general O
design O
of O
the O
original O
from O
clues O
on O
just O
a O
few O
shards O
. O

Conclusions O
that O
rest O
on O
a O
single O
sample O
may O
easily O
be O
inaccurate O
. O

Cheng B-PERSON
, O
using O
his O
training O
in O
archeology O
and O
the O
concept O
of O
" O
correlation O
, O
" O
is O
able O
to O
link O
together O
a O
single O
sample O
with O
pieces O
from O
the O
same O
culture O
found O
nearby O
, O
allowing O
him O
to O
draw O
conclusions O
with O
confidence O
and O
to O
bring O
his O
creative O
abilities O
into O
play O
while O
remaining O
true O
to O
the O
original O
. O

Reproducing O
the O
spirit O
of O
prehistoric O

Stop O
right O
there O
! O

You O
might O
wonder O
: O
If O
he O
is O
making O
reproductions O
, O
how O
can O
he O
bring O
creativity O
into O
it O
? O

Cheng B-PERSON
's O
response O
is O
this O
: O
" O
I O
think O
that O
the O
original O
potters O
also O
followed O
their O
whims O
and O
improvised O
when O
they O
worked O
, O
and O
did O
n't O
rigidly O
make O
each O
embellishment O
by O
rote O
. O
" O

Cheng B-PERSON
considers O
the O
problem O
and O
then O
adds O
: O
" O
I O
not O
only O
want O
to O
reproduce O
the O
appearance O
of O
the O
originals O
, O
but O
also O
the O
spirit O
of O
the O
people O
who O
made O
them O
. O

The O
reconstruction O
of O
an O
Ilan B-GPE
square O
- O
patterned O
pottery O
jar O
found O
by O
Liu B-PERSON
I I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chang I-PERSON
in O
the O
town O
of O
Chiushe B-GPE
is O
a O
good O
illustration O
of O
Cheng B-PERSON
's O
whole O
approach O
. O

Upon O
inspecting O
the O
original O
, O
Cheng B-PERSON
discovered O
that O
the O
walls O
were O
very O
thin O
. O

If O
the O
decorative O
pattern O
had O
been O
stamped O
on O
after O
the O
clay O
had O
been O
formed O
, O
it O
would O
certainly O
have O
ruined O
the O
shape O
. O

So O
how O
did O
the O
original O
maker O
get O
the O
pattern O
on O
there O
? O

Having O
repeatedly O
thought O
about O
this O
problem O
, O
Cheng B-PERSON
concluded O
that O
prehistoric O
potters O
must O
have O
used O
an O
internal O
mold O
when O
working O
. O

Perhaps O
they O
had O
shards O
that O
they O
could O
just O
pick O
up O
from O
the O
ground O
around O
them O
. O

They O
could O
take O
the O
kneaded O
clay O
, O
wrap O
it O
on O
the O
outside O
of O
the O
shards O
, O
and O
tap O
it O
down O
lightly O
with O
a O
wooden O
stick O
to O
make O
the O
clay O
more O
compact O
and O
solid O
. O

The O
stick O
would O
have O
patterns O
carved O
into O
it O
which O
would O
then O
be O
left O
imprinted O
on O
the O
clay O
. O

But O
this O
decorative O
effect O
, O
thinks O
Cheng B-PERSON
, O
was O
probably O
secondary B-ORDINAL
to O
the O
functional O
purpose O
of O
compacting O
the O
clay O
. O

With O
these O
ideas O
in O
mind O
, O
Cheng B-PERSON
first B-ORDINAL
ground O
up O
a O
handful O
of O
gravel O
, O
added O
it O
to O
the O
clay O
, O
and O
kneaded O
it O
vigorously O
. O

Then O
he O
took O
a O
mold O
that O
had O
been O
made O
from O
the O
original O
sample O
, O
and O
spread O
the O
clay O
- O
now O
with O
the O
texture O
of O
pizza O
dough O
- O
on O
the O
outside O
. O

Then O
he O
tapped O
it O
with O
a O
small O
stick O
, O
which O
he O
had O
personally O
prepared O
by O
paring O
off O
the O
bark O
and O
carving O
a O
pattern O
of O
squares O
into O
the O
wood O
. O

Next O
he O
cut O
away O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
jar O
and O
carefully O
removed O
it O
. O

He O
repeated O
the O
process O
to O
make O
the O
top O
section O
, O
then O
connected O
the O
upper O
and O
lower O
parts O
. O

Then O
, O
with O
his O
right O
hand O
he O
picked O
up O
the O
wood O
stick O
and O
tapped O
around O
the O
outside O
, O
while O
with O
his O
left O
he O
held O
a O
mushroom O
- O
shaped O
object O
against O
the O
inside O
of O
the O
jar O
to O
absorb O
the O
shock O
and O
prevent O
the O
jar O
from O
collapsing O
inward O
. O

A O
careful O
examination O
of O
the O
finished O
jar O
- O
with O
its O
square O
pattern O
already O
imprinted O
- O
showed O
it O
to O
look O
exactly O
like O
the O
sample O
in O
the O
photo O
. O

Dialogue O
with O
academia O

To O
reconstruct O
these O
36 B-CARDINAL
pieces O
of O
pottery O
, O
as O
much O
as O
he O
could O
Cheng B-PERSON
used O
the O
same O
tools O
as O
were O
available O
to O
their O
original O
makers O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
he O
avoided O
using O
any O
iron O
implements O
, O
since O
none O
had O
been O
available O
back O
then O
. O

When O
making O
the O
ceramic O
boar O
, O
he O
went O
into O
the O
bamboo O
forest O
in O
front O
of O
his O
house O
and O
cut O
off O
bamboo O
branches O
by O
hand O
to O
serve O
as O
the O
pig O
's O
nostrils O
. O

When O
there O
were O
no O
ready O
- O
made O
tools O
available O
, O
he O
made O
his O
own O
, O
such O
as O
the O
above O
- O
mentioned O
" O
mushroom O
head O
. O
" O

" O
Such O
a O
' O
mushroom O
head O
' O
was O
unearthed O
at O
the O
Peinan B-NORP
site O
, O
" O
says O
Cheng B-PERSON
, O
" O
and O
archeologists O
had O
no O
idea O
what O
it O
was O
for O
. O

But O
people O
like O
me O
who O
make O
pottery O
can O
identify O
its O
function O
with O
one B-CARDINAL
look O
. O
" O

Liu B-PERSON
I I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chang I-PERSON
states O
that O
his O
conversations O
with O
Cheng B-PERSON
have O
given O
him O
much O
food O
for O
thought O
and O
allowed O
him O
to O
more O
accurately O
visualize O
the O
lifestyles O
and O
technology O
of O
prehistoric O
peoples O
. O

" O
We O
help O
each O
other O
a O
lot O
. O
" O

For O
instance O
, O
Cheng B-PERSON
has O
brought O
his O
ceramicist O
's O
mind O
's O
eye O
to O
bear O
on O
the O
mystery O
of O
why O
gravel O
was O
mixed O
into O
prehistoric O
pottery O
. O

In O
virtually O
all O
archeological O
reports O
, O
prehistoric O
pottery O
includes O
gravel O
, O
usually O
at O
a O
level O
of O
25 B-PERCENT
- I-PERCENT
30 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
. O

Some O
also O
includes O
shells O
or O
hornblende O
. O

This O
is O
definitely O
not O
because O
prehistoric O
people O
were O
unable O
to O
get O
clay O
of O
greater O
purity O
. O

On O
the O
contrary O
, O
the O
clay O
they O
used O
was O
often O
of O
higher O
quality O
than O
clay O
today B-DATE
. O

Thus O
Cheng B-PERSON
concludes O
that O
the O
inclusion O
of O
gravel O
must O
have O
been O
deliberate O
. O

Cheng B-PERSON
explains O
: O
" O
These O
days O
most O
ceramic O
artists O
buy O
factory O
- O
produced O
clay O
that O
meets O
a O
certain O
set O
of O
specifications O
. O

Rarely O
would O
anybody O
add O
gravel O
. O

After O
all O
, O
everybody O
uses O
electric O
kilns O
, O
because O
they O
offer O
precise O
temperature O
control O
, O
so O
their O
pieces O
can O
be O
fired O
slowly O
, O
with O
no O
risk O
of O
cracking O
from O
overly O
rapid O
heating O
or O
cooling O
. O
" O

Prehistoric O
wisdom O

But O
prehistoric O
peoples O
did O
not O
possess O
any O
of O
these O
things O
. O

They O
had O
to O
dig O
, O
rinse O
, O
and O
filter O
their O
own O
clay O
, O
shape O
the O
pieces O
, O
then O
fire O
them O
all O
together O
in O
a O
big O
pile O
of O
wood O
under O
the O
open O
sky O
. O

This O
is O
why O
they O
added O
gravel O
to O
the O
clay O
, O
liking O
mixing O
stones O
into O
mud O
, O
to O
increase O
its O
strength O
and O
so O
avoid O
having O
the O
pottery O
fracture O
as O
it O
first B-ORDINAL
expanded O
under O
the O
heat O
and O
then O
contracted O
as O
it O
cooled O
. O

From O
this O
we O
can O
see O
, O
affirms O
Cheng B-PERSON
, O
that O
" O
prehistoric O
people O
understood O
how O
to O
use O
mixed O
materials O
, O
which O
was O
a O
major O
breakthrough O
in O
technique O
. O
" O

Cheng B-PERSON
found O
further O
indirect O
confirmation O
of O
his O
judgement O
about O
the O
technical O
skills O
possessed O
by O
prehistoric O
makers O
of O
pottery O
from O
a O
documentary O
on O
Japan B-GPE
's O
NHK B-ORG
network O
. O

In O
the O
film O
, O
a O
Japanese B-NORP
ceramic O
artist O
, O
an O
individual O
who O
is O
considered O
a O
" O
national O
treasure O
" O
of O
Japan B-GPE
, O
goes O
to O
visit O
a O
small O
island O
in O
Indonesia B-GPE
where O
everybody O
makes O
pottery O
. O

When O
he O
arrives O
there O
, O
this O
great O
master O
becomes O
more O
like O
a O
youthful O
acolyte O
. O

As O
the O
Japanese B-NORP
ceramicist O
slowly O
and O
steadily O
works O
the O
clay O
at O
his O
wheel O
, O
an O
elderly O
aboriginal O
woman O
working O
next O
to O
him O
just O
turns O
the O
wheel O
twice O
with O
her O
feet O
and O
shapes O
a O
finished O
ceramic O
jug O
. O

The O
ability O
of O
the O
indigenous O
people O
on O
this O
small O
island O
to O
judge O
the O
quality O
of O
clay O
was O
even O
more O
impressive O
. O

" O
They O
just O
toss O
some O
clay O
into O
their O
mouths O
and O
chew O
it O
around O
for O
a O
while O
, O
and O
they O
know O
whether O
it O
is O
good O
material O
or O
not O
. O

When O
we O
buy O
clay O
, O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
thing O
we O
look O
at O
is O
the O
written O
specifications O
, O
" O
says O
Cheng B-PERSON
with O
a O
laugh O

Though O
Cheng B-PERSON
was O
able O
to O
complete O
the O
full O
set O
of O

pottery O
reproductions O
requested O
by O
the O
museum O
, O
and O
at O
a O
level O

received O
high O

from O
the O

from O

, O
Cheng B-PERSON
himself O
still O
feels O
there O
are O
things O
that O
he O
could O
have O
done O
better O
. O

" O
The O
hardest O
part O
was O
getting O
the O
final O
color O
and O
texture O
of O
the O
originals O
to O
come O
through O
in O
the O
reproductions O
. O
" O

Cheng B-PERSON
relates O
that O
in O
this O
regard O
there O
were O
some O
factors O
he O
could O
manipulate O
, O
but O
others O
that O
were O
beyond O
his O
control O
. O

" O
What O
kind O
of O
clay O
did O
prehistoric O
people O
use O
? O

At O
what O
temperature O
did O
they O
fire O
the O
pots O
? O

You O
do O
n't O
get O
the O
same O
feeling O
from O
artifacts O
that O
have O
been O
buried O
in O
the O
ground O
for O
thousands O
of O
years O
, O
exposed O
to O
microbes O
and O
chemical O
transformations O
, O
that O
you O
can O
get O
instantly O
from O
the O
recreated O
works O
that O
I O
am O
doing O
today B-DATE
. O
" O

Cheng B-PERSON
admits O
that O
if O
he O
utilized O
extraneous O
processes O
, O
such O
as O
exposing O
the O
pieces O
to O
wood O
smoke O
for O
a O
long O
time O
, O
he O
could O
get O
the O
colors O
closer O
to O
those O
of O
the O
actual O
artifacts O
, O
but O
then O
he O
would O
be O
losing O
something O
else O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

Thus O
, O
before O
getting O
down O
to O
work O
on O
the O
final O
version O
of O
each O
piece O
, O
he O
made O
numerous O
trials O
, O
using O
different O
proportions O
of O
iron O
oxide O
, O
trying O
different O
temperatures O
, O
sometimes O
buffing O
the O
piece O
to O
make O
it O
glossy O
and O
other O
times O
not O
, O
to O
get O
as O
close O
as O
possible O
to O
the O
correct O
overall O
effect O
. O

And O
then O
of O
course O
there O
was O
the O
problem O
that O
the O
pottery O
- O
making O
process O
in O
prehistoric O
times O
was O
markedly O
different O
from O
the O
modern O
procedure O
. O

" O
These O
days O
we O
use O
electric O
kilns O
. O

Though O
they O
are O
safer O
, O
they O
do O
not O
leave O
the O
same O
traces O
that O
prehistoric O
pottery O
has O
from O
being O
fired O
outdoors O
with O
uneven O
exposure O
to O
the O
heat O
. O
" O

Cheng B-PERSON
feels O
very O
strongly O
about O
this O
. O

In O
Western B-NORP
mythology O
, O
man O
escaped O
the O
fate O
of O
the O
other O
animals O
by O
stealing O
fire O
from O
the O
gods O
, O
and O
it O
was O
fire O
that O
allowed O
the O
rise O
of O
bronze O
- O
age O
civilization O
and O
pottery O
cultures O
. O

But O
now O
, O
fire O
has O
been O
taken O
offstage O
, O
and O
replaced O
by O
electricity O
. O

The O
relationship O
between O
fire O
and O
potters O
has O
been O
severed O
by O
modern O
kilns O
. O

" O
There O
is O
only O
the O
moment O
when O
you O
turn O
on O
the O
power O
- O
click O
- O
there O
is O
no O
physical O
sensation O
of O
kindling O

or O

. O
" O

Back O
to O
the O
tribal O
experience O

After O
mulling O
over O
his O
experiences O
, O
Cheng B-PERSON
decided O
that O

is O
going O
to O
save O
up O

the O

Nor O
in O
that O
it O
is O
a O

Rather O
, O
it O
is O
the O
return O

The O

The O
alternation O

does O
not O
mean O
an O

My O

Midlife O
change O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
is O
a O
natural O
process O
in O
the O
journey O

and O
as O

grow O

shoulder O
ever O
heavier O

, O
all O
kinds O

large O

appear O
together O
at O

For O

, O
says O
Lu B-PERSON
, O
middle O

are O
the O

Their O

at O
their O
most O
rebellious O

Other O
elements O
in O
their O

such O

their O

for O
ten B-DATE

; O
the O

gone O

they O

just O
walk O
away O
from O
them O
. O

And O
again O
, O
turning O
to O
look O
at O
themselves O
, O
gray O

sprouting O
from O
their O

crows O
' O
feet O
appearing O
at O
the O
corners O
of O
their O
eyes O
, O
their O
jowls O
are O
sagging O

and O
the O
thick O

Midlife O

if O

a O

now O

the O
worry O
that O

Years O
of O

due O

her O

her O

Ms. O

also O
come O

a O
realization O

" O
My O

regarded O
us O
three B-CARDINAL

" O

Because O
of O
this O
, O
Ms. O

left O
home O
early O

But O
in O
her O
heart O
, O
her O
desire O
for O
love O
has O
never O
ceased O

Perhaps O
the O
shadow O
of O
her O
childhood O
is O
behind O
the O
setbacks O
in O
her O
love O
life O

so O
that O
even O
today O
she O
is O
still O
single O

At O

, O
Ms. O

has O
a O

" O

The O
year O
before O
last O
when O
her O

was O
dangerously O
ill O
, O
he O
constantly O
rang O
his O
children O
, O
begging O
for O
their O
love O

which O
aroused O
both O
her O
sympathy O

her O
disgust O

Having O
seen O
through O
the O
inconstancy O
of O
family O
affection O
and O
romantic O
attachments O
, O
she O
swore O
never O
again O
to O
put O
her O
emotions O
at O
the O

She O
wants O
to O

Keeping O

the O

they O
did O
not O

They O
had O

simply O

a O
three B-CARDINAL

Han B-NORP

silk O

that O
was O

Because O

the O

teasing O
the O

became O

According O
to O
legend O
, O
Liu B-PERSON
Hai I-PERSON
was O
the O
student O
of O
a O
miserly O
Daoist B-NORP
master O
. O

This O
master O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
corrupt O
and O
was O
put O
into O
a O
well O
for O
punishment O
, O
where O
he O
became O
a O
three B-CARDINAL

toad O

Liu B-PERSON
Hai I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
attempts O
to O
save O
his O
master O
repeatedly O
failed O
. O

Finally O
, O
Liu B-PERSON
Hai I-PERSON
came O
up O
with O
the O
idea O
of O
tying O
a O
silk O
thread O
to O
a O
traditional O
Chinese B-NORP
coin O
, O
which O
he O
threw O
into O
the O
well O
. O

When O
his O
teacher O
saw O
the O
coin O
, O
he O
could O
n't O
help O
but O
bite O
. O

From O
that O
moment O
, O
the O
three B-CARDINAL
- O

toad O
became O
a O
symbol O
of O
wealth O
, O
and O
the O
image O
of O
Liu B-PERSON

on O
the O
back O
of O
the O
toad O
with O
a O
large O
gold O

The O

the O

three B-CARDINAL

You O
could O
also O
buy O
brass O
toads O
that O
held O

in O

These O
served O
as O

whose O
owners O
would O
turn O
them O
facing O
outward O
in O
the O
morning O
so O
as O
to O
attract O

Then O
, O
when O
the O
shopkeepers O
closed O
their O

at O
dusk O
, O
they O
'd O
turn O
the O

the O

At O

Yeh B-PERSON

has O
worked O
in O
the O

, O
his O
field O

After O
graduating O
from O

, O
Yeh B-PERSON
opened O
the B-ORG
Mingli I-ORG
Plastics I-ORG
Factory I-ORG
. O

Their O
first B-ORDINAL
product O
was O
a O
plastic O
cigarette O
case O
. O

Back O
in O
those O
days O
farmers O
would O
always O
put O
cigarettes O
in O
their O
pockets O
when O
they O
went O
to O
the O
fields O
, O
but O
they O
would O
often O
find O
that O
their O
cigarettes O
would O
get O
crushed O
before O
they O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
smoke O
them O
. O

Both O
the O
cases O
and O
the O
machines O
to O
make O
them O
sold O
well O
all O
over O
Taiwan B-GPE
. O

Noting O
that O
glass O
baby O
bottles O
often O
cracked O
when O
boiled O
for O
sterilization O
, O
Yeh B-PERSON
then O
came O
up O
with O
the O
idea O
of O
replacing O
glass O
with O
polyethylene O
. O

His O
factory O
was O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
in O
the O
world O
to O
produce O
plastic O
baby O
bottles O
. O

Yeh B-PERSON
also O
made O
the O
sterilizers O
, O
and O
both O
lines O
proved O
to O
be O
very O
profitable O
. O

In O
was O
in O
this O
period O
that O
he O
met O
the O
owner O
of O
the O
factory O
across O
from O
his O
, O
who O
was O
a O
National B-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
member O
. O

Through O
him O
, O
Yeh B-PERSON
reestablished O
connections O
with O
BCC B-ORG
and O
once O
again O
threw O
himself O
into O
the O
recording O
industry O
. O

Yeh B-PERSON
recalls O
a O
" O
beautiful O
accident O
" O
: O
He O
bought O
a O
second B-ORDINAL
- O
hand O
electroplater O
from O
a O
Japanese B-NORP
and O
tried O
to O
plate O
various O
plastic O
products O
with O
chrome O
so O
as O
to O
make O
them O
more O
resilient O
. O

Only O
after O
repeated O
failures O
and O
much O
frustration O
did O
he O
think O
about O
electroplating O
his O
black O
plastic O
albums O
with O
nickel O
and O
copper O
to O
make O
them O
stronger O
. O

This O
thrust O
him O
into O
the O
realm O
of O
media O
storage O
. O

" O
The O
times O
change O
faster O
with O
each O
wave O
, O
" O
says O
Yeh B-PERSON
. O

He O
explains O
that O
it O
took O
100 B-DATE
years I-DATE
after O
Edison B-PERSON
invented O
phonograph O
records O
for O
something O
better O
- O

Their O

Competing O
in O
the O

age O
, O
Yeh B-PERSON
has O
seen O
industries O
rise O
and O
fall O
. O

Resilient O
and O
flexible O
, O
he O
never O
recoils O
from O
challenges O
. O

Back O
when O
CDs O
were O
still O
in O
their O
infancy O
, O
Yeh B-PERSON
relied O
on O
his O
old O
relationship O
with O
Sony B-ORG
and O
found O
a O
team O
of O
engineers O
associated O
with O
the B-ORG
Industrial I-ORG
Technology I-ORG
Research I-ORG
Institute I-ORG
before O
he O
made O
a O
push O
into O
CD O
production O
. O

Starting O
from O
simple O
pieces O
of O
compressed O
plastic O
, O
they O
went O
one B-CARDINAL
step O
at O
a O
time O
, O
building O
a O
sturdy O
foundation O
of O
technical O
knowledge O
that O
Ritek B-ORG
still O
enjoys O
today B-DATE
. O

In O
1990 B-DATE
Ritek B-ORG
started O
to O
press O
CDs O
, O
becoming O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
mass O
- O
production O
manufacturer O
of O
CDs O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
. O

Back O
then O
, O
it O
cost O
Japanese B-NORP
manufacturers O
about O
NT$ O
80 B-MONEY
to O
press O
one O
CD O
. O

Ritek B-ORG
garnered O
market O
share O
by O
undercutting O
the O
competition O
and O
charging O
only O
NT$ B-MONEY
50 I-MONEY
. O

With O
the O
support O
that O
Yeh B-PERSON
had O
long O
enjoyed O
in O
the O
recording O
industry O
here O
, O
Ritek B-ORG
was O
easily O
able O
to O
market O
its O
goods O
. O

What O
really O
brought O
Ritek B-ORG
into O
the O
realm O
of O
high O
- O
technology O
was O
developing O
its O
own O
CD O
- O
Rs O
-LRB- O
recordable O
CDs O
-RRB- O
. O

Taking O
a O
different O
tack O
from O
the O
Japanese B-NORP
, O
who O
were O
plating O
CD O
- O
Rs O
with O
a O
thin O
gold O
layer O
, O
Ritek B-ORG
instead O
developed O
a O
cheap O
and O
high O
- O
quality O
process O
for O
coating O
them O
with O
silver O
or O
aluminum O
. O

These O
allowed O
for O
a O
much O
lower O
price O
that O
in O
turn O
created O
more O
demand O
. O

It O
is O
yet O
another O
example O
of O
a O
Taiwanese B-NORP
company O
starting O
a O
global O
price O
war O
. O

Marching O
forward O

Being O
competitive O
in O
terms O
of O
price O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
Ritek B-ORG
's O
strong O
points O
, O
but O
it O
's O
not O
the O
whole O
story O
behind O
the O
company O
's O
success O
. O

Another O
important O
factor O
is O
that O
at O
key O
moments O
Yeh B-PERSON
has O
not O
hesitated O
to O
invest O
the O
necessary O
sums O
when O
it O
was O
necessary O
to O
bring O
the O
technology O
to O
the O
next O
level O
. O

" O
Ten B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
when O
we O
first B-ORDINAL
started O
producing O
CDs O
, O
one O
machine O
required O
five B-CARDINAL
or I-CARDINAL
six I-CARDINAL
persons O
to O
operate O
, O
" O
Yeh B-PERSON
recalls O
. O

" O
When O
a O
flood O
of O
orders O
came O
in O
, O
we O
'd O
have O
everyone O
working O
overtime O
with O
shifts O
going O
around O
the O
clock O
, O
but O
we O
still O
were O
n't O
able O
to O
keep O
up O
with O
demand O
. O

That O
's O
when O
the O
workers O
took O
the O
initiative O
to O
suggest O
that O
we O
automate O
. O
" O

Now O
everything O
from O
ordering O
and O
production O
to O
storage O
and O
shipping O
is O
computerized O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
person O
is O
typically O
responsible O
for O
about B-CARDINAL
10 I-CARDINAL
machines O
. O

The O
whole O
process O
has O
been O
shortened O
, O
and O
quality O
is O
high O
. O

The O
amount O
that O
the O
same O
3,000 B-CARDINAL
workers O
can O
produce O
has O
exploded O
from O
200,000 B-CARDINAL
a O
month O
to O
200 B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
a O
month O
. O

Automation O
has O
meant O
that O
the O
workers O
have O
had O
to O
learn O
how O
to O
operate O
sophisticated O
machinery O
and O
computers O
, O
so O
that O
Ritek B-ORG
has O
advanced O
out O
of O
the O
ranks O
of O
the O
traditional O
plastic O
disc O
pressers O
. O

Automation O
has O
also O
allowed O
the O
company O
to O
lower O
costs O
at O
a O
time O
when O
the O
price O
of O
data O
storage O
media O
has O
been O
plummeting O
. O

In O
the B-DATE
third I-DATE
quarter I-DATE
last I-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
the O
price O
of O
a O
CD O
- O
ROM O
suddenly O
fell O
from O
60 B-MONEY
US I-MONEY
cents I-MONEY
to O
40 B-MONEY
cents I-MONEY
, O
which O
is O
n't O
far O
from O
the B-MONEY
30 I-MONEY
cents I-MONEY
it O
costs O
to O
make O
. O

It O
's O
a O
long O
way O
from O
the O
US$ O
14 B-MONEY
that O
they O
cost O
when O
they O
first B-ORDINAL
hit O
the O
market O
five B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
. O

Yet O
Ritek B-ORG
has O
still O
managed O
to O
maintain O
operating O
profits O
of O
22 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
, O
and O
the O
falling O
prices O
have O
n't O
crushed O
it O
. O

The O
coming O
wave O
of O
technology O
will O
focus O
on O
light O
and O
small O
portable O
data O
devices O
such O
as O
PDAs O
and O
MP3 O
players O
, O
so O
the O
challenge O
for O
Ritek B-ORG
is O
allowing O
devices O
that O
are O
becoming O
smaller O
and O
smaller O
to O
have O
larger O
data O
capacities O
and O
higher O
fidelity O
. O

Yeh B-PERSON
points O
out O
that O
the O
patent O
rights O
for O
mini-discs O
are O
owned O
entirely O
by O
big O
Japanese B-NORP
companies O
, O
but O
Ritek B-ORG
is O
the O
only O
company O
manufacturing O
them O
. O

Ritek B-ORG
is O

no O
larger O

a O

, O
as O

the O

Ritek B-ORG
will O
be O

the O

A B-DATE

: O
How O
do O
you O
define O
your O

Successfully O
defining O

is O
a O
process O
of O
elimination O
. O

In O
the B-DATE
late I-DATE
1980s I-DATE
, O
Intel B-ORG
realized O
that O
it O
could O
no O
longer O
compete O
with O
Japanese B-NORP
semiconductor O
companies O
in O
the O
production O
of O
memory O
chips O
, O
so O
it O
left O
that O
market O
, O
believing O
that O
it O
would O
only O
be O
able O
to O
break O
free O
from O
Japanese B-NORP
competition O
by O
focusing O
on O
its O
specialty O
of O
microprocessors O
. O

It O
is O
now O
a O

many O

The O
more O
clearly O
a O

the O
more O
limited O

be O
its O

But O
just O
about O
any O
successful O
company O
has O
a O
clear O
sense O
of O
its O
limitations O
, O
because O
otherwise O
it O
would O

be O
able O

differentiate O
itself O
in O
the O

and O
reduce O
its O
vulnerablility O

Consequently O
, O
it O

essential O

the O

points O
: O

1. B-CARDINAL
No O
matter O
how O

your O

Why O
now O
? O

Why O

? O

Consequently O
, O
you O
must O
consider O
the O

points O
: O

1. B-CARDINAL
Why O
should O
this O

Are O
you O

When O
you O

there O
will O
invariably O
be O
one B-CARDINAL
question O
that O
each O

every O
one O
of O
those O
potential O

will O

in O

" O
You O

what O

" O

Investors O
hope O
that O

risk O
, O
because O
only O
with O
commensurate O
risk O
will O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
sides O

Therefore O
, O
the O

very O

about O
the O

the O
possibility O

losing O
the O

2. B-CARDINAL

: O
Is O

Founders O

almost O
always O
start O
with O
people O
around O
them O

then O
move O

to O

Investors O
like O
to O
hear O

say O

that O

aware O

Communication O

certainly O
no O

a O

The O

is O
just O
one B-CARDINAL
example O

With O

the O

the O

to O

first O

how O

" O
listen O

" O
and O
secondly O
can O
think O
logically O

learn O

take O
an O

a O
question O

then O
respond O
by O
focusing O
on O
the O
questioner O

needs O
. O

You O
must O
never O
force O
others O
to O
dance O
at O
your O
expert O
pace O
. O

Do O
n't O
overestimate O
your O
listeners O
' O
specialized O
knowledge O
, O
but O
do O
n't O
underestimate O
their O
general O
intelligence O
. O

From O
the O
very O

2. B-CARDINAL

since O
November B-DATE
. O

According O
to O
Li B-PERSON
, O
the O
newsletter O
is O
extremely O
important O
to O
people O
in O
the O
disaster O
area O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
reasons O
. O

Firstly B-ORDINAL
, O
it O
enables O
people O
to O
share O
information O
. O

People O
can O
see O
that O
they O
are O
not O
alone O
in O
their O
suffering O
, O
and O
that O
they O
must O
address O
their O
situation O
from O
a O
collective O
standpoint O
instead O
of O
chasing O
after O
individual O
problems O
one B-CARDINAL
at O
a O
time O
. O

Secondly B-ORDINAL
, O
people O
in O
the O
disaster O
area O
need O
information O
from O
the O
outside O
world O
, O
and O
now O
that O
the O
news O
media O
have O
shifted O
their O
attention O
to O
other O
matters O
, O
the O
local O
people O
need O
an O
avenue O
by O
which O
to O
get O
their O
message O
out O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
. O

The O
newsletter O
is O
just O
the O
thing O
to O
accomplish O
these O
objectives O
. O

This O
newsletter O
has O
also O
helped O
to O
spur O
increased O
contact O
between O
the O
people O
of O
Peipu B-GPE
and O
Shihkang B-GPE
. O

According O
to O
Li B-PERSON
Chieh I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
ying I-PERSON
, O
they O
distribute O
3,000 B-CARDINAL
copies O
of O
the B-ORG
Shihkang I-ORG
Newsletter I-ORG
in O
Shihkang B-GPE
, O
500 B-CARDINAL
in O
Tungshih B-GPE
and O
Shinshe B-GPE
, O
and O
1,000 B-CARDINAL
in O
Peipu B-GPE
, O
which O
enables O
the O
people O
of O
Peipu B-GPE
to O
truly O
get O
a O
feel O
for O
what O
is O
needed O
in O
the O
disaster O
area O
. O

By O
sending O
a O
person O
to O
serve O
full O
- O
time O
at O
the B-ORG
Shihkang I-ORG
Work I-ORG
Station I-ORG
, O
TCAC B-ORG
has O
managed O
to O
quickly O
integrate O
itself O
into O
the O
local O
community O
in O
Shihkang B-GPE
, O
and O
to O
see O
where O
assistance O
is O
most O
urgently O
needed O
. O

The O
children O
of O
Shihkang B-GPE
, O
for O
example O
, O
are O
in O
especially O
great O
need O
of O
psychological O
counseling O
, O
so O
TCAC B-ORG
asked O
the B-ORG
Hsiuh I-ORG
- I-ORG
li I-ORG
Liuh I-ORG
Memorial I-ORG
Foundation I-ORG
to O
provide O
therapy O
for O
children O
and O
teachers O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the B-ORG
Shihkang I-ORG
Work I-ORG
Station I-ORG
is O
also O
helping O
to O
build O
prefab O
shelters O
. O

The B-ORG
Far I-ORG
Eastern I-ORG
group I-ORG
only O
donated O
50 B-CARDINAL
prefab O
units O
, O
and O
people O
in O
less O
than O
privileged O
situations O
-LRB- O
such O
as O
renters O
and O
those O
living O
in O
illegally O
constructed O
residences O
-RRB- O
were O
not O
even O
eligible O
to O
apply O
for O
them O
, O
so O
TCAC B-ORG
has O
been O
working O
hard O
to O
put O
up O
prefab O
units O
for O
the O
residents O
of O
Tzu B-FAC
- I-FAC
yun I-FAC
Lane I-FAC
. O

Several O
old O
residences O
collapsed O
there O
, O
causing O
numerous O
deaths O
and O
injuries O
. O

The O
work O
on O
the O
prefab O

has O
been O
a O
race O
against O
time O
, O
for O
as O
Shu B-PERSON

points O
out O
, O
some O
people O
in O
the O
disaster O
area O
have O
died O
of O
cold O
over O
the O
winter O
. O

To O
survive O
the O
great O
earthquake O
only O
to O
die O
because O
of O
an O
inadequate O
relief O

seems O
the O
height O

" O
I O
used O

in O
another O

every O
time O
I O
came O

would O
go O

down O

In O

" O
says O

adding O
that O
when O
help O
is O
needed O
the O
locals O
are O
likely O
to O
contribute O
not O
just O
money O
but O
something O
even O
more O
valuable O
- O
their O
time O
and O
energy O
. O

When O
TCAC B-ORG
puts O
on O
an O
activity O
, O
for O
example O
, O
if O
someone O
notices O
that O
an O
event O
organizer O
is O
getting O
thirsty O
they O
will O
immediately O
bring O
him O
a O
bottle O
of O
mineral O
water O
. O

When O
a O
musical O
performance O
is O
scheduled O
, O
someone O
will O
always O
take O
it O
upon O
themselves O
to O
set O
out O
seats O
for O
the O
audience O
. O

" O
If O
the O
local O
residents O
agree O
with O
what O
you O
're O
doing O
, O
they O
're O
sure O
to O
pitch O

help O

" O
says O
Shu B-PERSON
, O
who O
considers O
this O
spirit O
of O
volunteerism O
much O
more O
valuable O
than O
monetary O
donations O

That O
is O
why O
TCAC B-ORG
has O
been O
able O
to O
carry O
out O
so O
many O

over O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE

begun O
to O
sense O
the O
value O
of O
what O
they O
've O
got O
in O
their O
community O
. O

The O
campaign O
to O
beautify O
Peipu B-GPE

is O
an O
excellent O
case O
in O
point O

Seven B-DATE
years I-DATE

in O

to O
ease O
the O

, O
the O
township O
widened O
Hsia B-FAC
Street I-FAC

The O
project O
required O
demolition O
of O
all O
the O
covered O

that O
used O
to O
stand O
outside O
the O
stores O
there O
. O

It O
seemed O
like O
a O
laudable O
move O
toward O
modernization O
at O
the O
time O
, O
but O
people O
living O
along O
the O
street O
came O
to O
rue O
the O
loss O
of O
their O
covered O
walkways O
. O

Cars O
came O
roaring O
down O
in O
great O
numbers O
along O
the O
widened O
street O
, O
while O
the O
residents O
lost O
the O
space O
in O
front O
of O
their O
homes O
where O
they O
had O
once O
enjoyed O
many O
a O
leisurely O
hour O

According O
to O
Chiang B-PERSON
Yi I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
sen I-PERSON
, O
whose O
store O
is O
located O
on O
Hsia B-FAC
Street I-FAC
, O
everybody O
used O
to O
congregate O
in O
the O
cool O
shade O
of O
the O
walkways O
in O
the O
summer O
. O

Neighbors O
were O
more O
involved O
with O
each O
other O
, O
and O
his O
two B-CARDINAL
children O
always O
had O
a O
place O
to O
play O
. O

Now O
that O
the O
covered O
walkways O
have O
been O
replaced O
by O
parking O
spaces O
, O
people O
scarcely O
leave O
their O
homes O
. O

The O
old O
folks O
stay O
inside O
watching O

, O
while O
the O
young O
people O
only O
emerge O
briefly O
on O
their O
way O
to O

People O
rarely O
have O
a O

Fortunately O
, O
the O
people O
of O

quickly O
realized O
their O

actually O

top O
concern O
was O

Although O

have O
been O

it O
also O
generated O
a O

ill O

because O
neither O

President O

were O
just O
one B-CARDINAL

discussed O
with O

It O
may O
be O
that O
the O

the O
only O

get O
Taiwan B-GPE

Separate O
entry O

a O

Snake O
venoms O
contain O

and O
as O
well O
as O
being O
useful O

the O

they O

the O

for O

many O

But O
due O
to O
their O
complexity O
, O
snake O
venoms O
are O
not O
easily O
synthesized O
, O
so O
they O
have O
to O
be O

According O

the O

more O

really O
the O
most O

of O

a O

states O
that O
among O

" O
top O
five B-CARDINAL
" O
poisonous O
snakes O
, O
the O
hundred B-CARDINAL
- O
pacer O
in O
fact O
has O
the O
weakest O
venom O
. O

But O
its O
fangs O
are O
especially O
long O
, O
and O
it O
secretes O
the O
largest O
quantity O
of O
venom O
of O
any O
Taiwanese B-NORP
snake O
. O

However O
, O
the O
hundred B-CARDINAL
- O
pacer O
lives O
in O
the O
dark O
depths O
of O
the O
dense O
jungle O
, O
and O
its O
numbers O
are O
relatively O
small O
. O

Not O
only O
does O
it O
take O
a O
goodly O
portion O
of O
luck O
for O
a O
snake O
hunter O
to O
find O
a O
hundred B-CARDINAL

the O
number O

also O
very O
small O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
mountain O
lover O
who O
often O
encounters O
snakes O
on O
his O
hiking O
expeditions O
describes O
the O
hundred B-CARDINAL
- O
pacer O
as O
" O
cool O
, O
calm O
and O
collected O
, O
" O
and O
people O
who O
have O
kept O
or O
observed O
hundred B-CARDINAL

also O
say O
they O
" O
do O
n't O
lash O
out O

describes O
them O
as O
" O
really O
the O
chieftain O
among O

they O
have O
a O
serene O

tolerant O
nature O
, O
and O
are O
not O
apt O
to O
attack O
people O
wantonly O
. O
" O

Perhaps O
it O
is O
because O
of O
this O
regal O
temperament O
that O
they O
are O
revered O
as O
ancestral O
spirits O
by O
the O
Paiwan B-NORP
. O

The O
hundred B-CARDINAL
- O
pacer O
belongs O
to O
the O
viper O
family O
, O
which O
was O
the O
last O
of O
the O

families O
to O
evolve O
. O

Unlike O

the O

of O

explains O
that O
snakes O
evolved O
from O
hole O

dwelling O
animals O
, O
and O
lacking O
limbs O
, O
they O
are O
less O
agile O
than O
most O
quadrupeds O
. O

Their O
vision O
and O
hearing O
are O
also O
poor O
. O

Hence O
their O
poison O
fangs O
are O
almost O
the O
only O
tools O
they O
have O
to O
catch O
food O
and O
defend O
themselves O
with O

In O
recent B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
Tu B-PERSON
and O
his O

have O
gradually O
researched O
the O
ecology O
of O
the O
viper O
species O
Trimeresurus O
gracilis O
, O
which O
is O
endemic O
to O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
and O
of O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
green O
tree O
viper O
. O

But O
few O
researchers O
have O
taken O
an O
interest O
in O
the O
hundred B-CARDINAL
- O
pacer O
, O
which O
lives O
deep O
in O
the O

has O
limited O
distribution O
. O

Although O
it O

says O
that O
as O
far O
as O
is O
known O
from O
observation O
of O
snakes O
in O
the O

, O
they O
live O
largely O
solitary O

. O

Their O
sense O

an O

and O
in O
the O

male O

are O
attracted O
by O

released O
by O
the O

. O

In O
late B-DATE
October I-DATE
1999 I-DATE
, O
the O
zoo O
began O
putting O
the O
male O
and O
female O
hundred B-CARDINAL

pacers O
together O
in O
pairs O
, O
and O
one B-CARDINAL
pair O
took O
a O
liking O
to O
each O
other O
. O

The O
male O
gently O
courted O
the O
female O
by O
licking O
her O
head O
with O
his O

. O

For O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
three I-DATE

the O

were O
inseparable O

after O
which O
they O
gradually O
returned O
to O
their O

. O

In O
February B-DATE
of I-DATE
last I-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
the O
female O
snake O

belly O
gradually O
began O
to O
swell O
, O
and O
an O

confirmed O
she O
was O
pregnant O
. O

In O
the B-DATE
two I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
after O
she O
laid O
her O
eggs O
, O
the O
female O
hundred B-CARDINAL
- O
pacer O
protected O
them O
vigorously O
. O

Not O
daring O
to O
anger O
her O
, O
the O
zoo O
staff O
waited O
for O
her O
maternal O
instincts O
to O
subside O
somewhat O
before O
removing O
the O
eggs O
. O

In O
August B-DATE
last I-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
as O
Taiwan B-GPE
was O
being O
buffeted O
by O
a O
typhoon O
, O
over O
20 B-CARDINAL
eggs O
hatched O
out O
into O
tiny O
snakes O
, O
which O
the O
zoo O
hopes O
can O
grow O
up O
safe O
and O
sound O
. O

During O
this O
first B-ORDINAL
breeding O
session O
, O
for O
fear O
of O
anything O
going O
wrong O
with O
the O
pregnancy O
the O
zoo O
staff O
disturbed O
the O

as O
little O
as O
possible O
. O

But O
Lin B-PERSON

says O
that O
next O

around O
they O
will O
gather O
more O

such O

However O
, O
no O

how O
many O
hundred B-CARDINAL

pacers O
we O
can O
see O
at O
the O

it O
is O

that O

of O
the O

all O

said O
they O
had O
never O
heard O
a O

. O

Lavuras B-PERSON
asked O
the O
scholars O
bluntly O
where O
they O
had O
seen O
hundred B-CARDINAL
- O
pacers O
. O

If O
it O
was O
in O
the O
zoo O
, O
the O
snakes O
were O
away O
from O
their O
natural O
environment O
. O

But O
even O
if O
it O
was O
in O
the O

, O
with O
the O
great O
environmental O
changes O
of O
modern O
times O
the O
snakes O
might O
have O
been O
" O
struck O
dumb O
" O
too O
! O

Whether O
hundred B-CARDINAL
- O
pacers O
really O
do O
have O
a O
voice O
is O
an O
unanswered O
question O
of O
biology O
. O

But O
perhaps O
the O
aborigines O
' O
open O
attitude O
toward O
and O
involvement O
in O
the O
natural O
world O
, O
as O
revealed O
in O
their O

is O
something O
even O
harder O
to O
imagine O
for O
modern O

who O
received O

: O
those O

those O

In O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
Taiwan B-GPE
was O
a O
recipient O
of O
American B-NORP
aid O

so O
now O
that O
Taiwan B-GPE

the O
economic O
power O
to O
return O
the O
favor O

the O
international O
community O

it O

explains O

" O
In O
fact O
the O
amount O
of O
money O
Taiwan B-GPE
spends O
on O
foreign O
assistance O
is O
very O
limited O

Currently O
the O
UN B-ORG
asks O
that O
OECD B-ORG
countries O
try O
to O
spend O
0.7 B-PERCENT

Although O
most O

most O

on O

Since O
there O
is O
a O
basic O
obligation O

all O

, O
and O
Taiwan B-GPE
is O
already O
doing O
less O

it O
is O
all O

relationship O
can O
not O
be O
summed O
up O
as O
a O
purely O
financial O
one O
. O

Chang B-PERSON
continues O
: O
" O
It O
is O
shallow O
to O
see O
the O
maintenance O
of O
relations O
between O
the O
ROC B-GPE
and O
its O
diplomatic O
partners O
as O
depending O
only O
on O
money O
. O

Ties O
with O
some O
Latin B-NORP
American I-NORP
countries O
go O
back O
40 B-DATE
or I-DATE
50 I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

Such O
a O
long O
period O
of O
friendship O
can O
not O
be O
explained O
only O
by O
the O
size O
or O
wealth O
of O
the O
countries O
involved O
. O

" O
In O
fact O
, O
in O
recent B-DATE
years I-DATE
the O
PRC B-GPE
has O
spent O
much O
larger O
sums O
of O
money O
than O
Taiwan B-GPE
in O
trying O
to O
woo O
away O
the O
ROC B-GPE
's O
diplomatic O
partners O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
often O
dangles O
its O
enormous O
domestic O
market O
before O
them O
as O
an O
inducement O
. O

Take O
for O
example O
the O
so O
- O
called O
" O
banana O
diplomacy O
" O
the O
PRC B-GPE
employed O
toward O
Costa B-GPE
Rica I-GPE
three B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
. O

Attempting O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
bananas O
are O
Costa B-GPE
Rica I-GPE
's I-GPE
main O
export O
, O
the O
PRC B-GPE
, O
through O
private O
channels O
, O
indicated O
that O
it O
would O
be O
willing O
to O
purchase O
Costa B-NORP
Rican I-NORP
bananas O
at O
a O
high O
price O
. O

However O
, O
because O
the O
PRC B-GPE
has O
no O
formal O
diplomatic O
relations O
with O
Costa B-GPE
Rica I-GPE
, O
they O
would O
have O
to O
add O
a O
40 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
customs O
tax O
. O

This O
was O
clearly O
an O
effort O
to O
use O
commercial O
incentives O
to O
force O
the O
Costa B-NORP
Rican I-NORP
government O
's O
hand O
. O

As O
it O
turned O
out O
, O
Costa B-NORP
Rican I-NORP
bananas O
had O
been O
contracted O
out O
early O
to O
large O
corporations O
, O
and O
also O
some O
of O
the O
companies O
commissioned O
by O
the O
PRC B-GPE
failed O
to O
pay O
up O
as O
promised O
, O
causing O
Costa B-NORP
Rican I-NORP
farmers O
to O
lose O
confidence O
in O
them O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
the O
PRC B-GPE
goal O
was O
not O
achieved O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
from O
this O
case O
you O
can O
see O
that O
PRC B-GPE
diplomacy O
has O
been O
extended O
to O
cover O
the O
commercial O
field O
as O
well O
. O

Learning O
from O
this O
, O
President O
Chen B-PERSON
says O
that O
Taiwan B-GPE
must O
deepen O
its O
economic O
diplomacy O
. O

The O
government O
must O
take O
the O
lead O
in O
negotiating O
the O
construction O
of O
markets O
and O
the O
creation O
of O
business O
opportunities O
with O
other O
countries O
and O
international O
organizations O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
businesses O
must O
collectively O
move O
to O
the O
front O
line O
. O

Only O
in O
this O
way O
can O
a O
win O
- O
win O
situation O
for O
both O
diplomacy O
and O
trade O
be O
created O
. O

The O
problem O
is O
that O
Taiwan B-GPE
has O
been O
engaged O
in O
economic O
diplomacy O
for O
many B-DATE
years I-DATE
now O
, O
yet O
the O
results O
are O
not O
particularly O
obvious O
. O

Jason B-PERSON
Hu I-PERSON
says O
that O
currently O
economic O
diplomacy O
has O
shown O
only O
limited O
results O
, O
but O
there O
are O
still O
areas O
where O
the O
new O
government O
can O
work O
harder O
. O

" O
The O
main O
thing O
the O
government O
can O
do O
is O
provide O
information O
and O
convenience O
. O

This O
requires O
coordination O
among O

Government B-ORG
Information I-ORG
Office I-ORG
[ O
GIO B-ORG

, O
MOEA B-ORG
, O
and O

Yet O
, O
so O
far O
, O
only O
the O
GIO B-ORG
has O
sent O
staff O
to O
diplomatic O
partners O
to O
coordinate O
, O
while O
the O
MOEA B-ORG
has O
not O
posted O
staff O
to O
all O
relevant O
overseas O
offices O
, O
" O
he O
says O
. O

Greater O
effort O
and O
creativity O
is O
needed O
in O
economic O
diplomacy O
, O
which O
in O
turn O
requires O
more O
study O
and O
discussion O
among O
the O
political O
parties O
, O
businessmen O
, O
and O
the O
academic O
community O
, O
as O

as O
greater O
flexibility O

in O
the O
MOFA B-ORG

agencies O
. O

Process O
vs. O
outcomes O

The O
number O
of O
ROC B-GPE
diplomatic O
partners O
is O
far O
behind O
that O
of O
the O
PRC B-GPE
, O
which O
seriously O
impedes O
Taiwan B-GPE
's O
efforts O
to O
take O
part O
in O
international O
organizations O
. O

For O
international O
organizations O
of O
which O

already O
member O
, O
such O
as O
the B-ORG
United I-ORG

, O
although O
Taiwan B-GPE
has O
repeatedly O
knocked O
at O
the O
door O
, O
it O
has O
met O
with O
repeated O
failure O
as O
a O
result O
of O
international O
pressure O
imposed O
by O
the O
PRC B-GPE
under O
the O
" O

to O
which O
both O
sides O
are O
attempting O
to O
gain O
entry O
as O
early O
as O
possible O
, O
the O
PRC B-GPE
has O
brought O
its O
diplomatic O
superiority O
to O
bear O
in O
order O
to O
ensure O
that O
it O
will O
enter O
prior O
to O
Taiwan B-GPE
. O

However O
, O
because O
negotiations O
with O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
on O
early O
PRC B-GPE
entry O
have O
not O
reached O
a O
successful O
outcome O
, O
PRC B-GPE
entry O
has O
been O
continually O
postponed O
, O
which O
has O
seriously O
affected O
the O
schedule O
for O

entry O
. O

In O
this O
age O
of O
the O
global O
village O
, O
international O

are O
increasingly O

How O
much O

in O

at O

believes O
that O
Taiwan B-GPE
still O
has O
room O
to O
maneuver O
in O
terms O
of O
international O
economic O
organizations O
. O

But O
as O

such O
as O
the B-ORG
World I-ORG

, O
the O
ROC B-GPE
faces O
countless O
obstacles O

In O

currently O
the O
only O

When O

in O
August B-DATE
, O
the O
president O
of O

for O

that O
his O
country O
would O
be O
willing O
to O
help O
Taiwan B-GPE
enter O

But O
he O
suggested O
that O
Taiwan B-GPE
should O
reconsider O
its O
tactical O
approach O
; O
otherwise O
repeated O
failure O
could O
cause O
people O
to O
lose O
interest O

In O

this O
has O

happened O
in O

public O
, O
which O
has O
seen O
the O

are O
wondering O
whether O

Applying O

that O

" O
economic O

, O
and O
entry O
into O

- O
differ O
little O
from O
the O
past O
, O
you O
must O
remember O
that O

is O
a O
long O

game O
, O
and O
, O
in O
the O
details O
, O
the O
new O

has O
already O
brought O
in O
some O
fresh O

For O
example O
, O
she O
notes O
, O
recently O
the O
MOFA B-ORG
, O
through O
its O
" O
virtual O

aim O
is O
to O
develop O
the O

In O

is O
eliminating O

proven O

and O
is O
promoting O

that O

though O
there O

no O

relations O
as O
a O
result O
of O

such O

The B-ORG

intends O

By O

emphasized O
" O
soft O
national O
power O
. O
" O

Before O
her O
departure O
she O
stated O
that O
Taiwan B-GPE
advocates O
human O
rights O
, O
democracy O
, O
high O
- O
technology O
, O
compassion O
, O
and O
peace O
. O

If O
Taiwan B-GPE
can O
further O
develop O
foreign O
relations O
using O
such O
" O
soft O
power O
, O
" O
one O
day O
the B-ORG
United I-ORG
Nations I-ORG
will O
turn O
around O
and O
want O
Taiwan B-GPE
to O
join O
. O

Diplomats O
are O
anxious O
for O
a O
breakthrough O
that O
will O
reverse O
negative O
trends O
. O

But O
many O
people O
say O
that O
the O
root O
of O
the O
ROC B-GPE
's O
foreign O
policy O
difficulties O
is O
still O
in O
the O
relationship O
with O
the O
PRC B-GPE
. O

Right O
now O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
sides O
are O
at O
an O
impasse O
. O

It O
is O
unlikely O
there O
will O
be O
any O
progress O
on O
diplomatic O
or O
cross-strait O
issues O
between O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
sides O
. O

Before O
departing O
on O
his O
trip O
, O
President O
Chen B-PERSON
repeatedly O
stressed O
that O
, O
despite O
the O
tremendous O
pressure O
coming O
from O
the O
mainland O
, O
there O
are O
other O
considerations O
in O
foreign O
policy O
. O

Indeed O
, O
says O
Joanne B-PERSON
Chang I-PERSON
, O
it O
is O
precisely O
because O
diplomatic O
and O
cross-strait O
issues O
are O
inextricably O
intertwined O
that O
foreign O
policy O
breakthroughs O
are O
needed O
. O

If O
more O
states O
support O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
Taipei B-GPE
will O
have O
more O
cards O
to O
play O
in O
cross-strait O
negotiations O
, O
and O
domestic O
morale O
will O
be O
bolstered O
and O
people O
's O
fears O
alleviated O
. O

As O
President O
Chen B-PERSON
said O
, O
determination O
is O
power O
. O

The O
global O
values O
espoused O
by O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
including O
democracy O
, O
human O
rights O
, O
love O
, O
and O
peace O
, O
are O
the O
real O
assets O
of O
ROC B-GPE
diplomacy O
. O

The O
old O
saying O
has O
it O
that O
" O
a O

will O
never O

alone O

In O
the O

, O
Taiwan B-GPE

hit O
by O
a O
rash O
of O

. O

Clearly O
, O
the O
activities O

are O

destructive O

Can O
we O

The O

with O
the O

at O
Lungkeng B-GPE

located O
at O
the O

and O
the O

cleaning O
the O
uplifted O
coral O

and O
restoring O
the O

of O
the O

The O
problem O
is O
that O
efforts O

up O
the O

could O
cause O
great O
damage O
to O
the O

How O
to O
go O
about O

the O
environmental O
destruction O
that O
has O

Due O
to O
a O
lack O

the O

The O

at O
about O
5 B-TIME

A B-QUANTITY

In O

The O

, O
sorbents O
, O
helicopters O
, O
and O
other O
equipment O
needed O
for O
responding O
to O

. O

The O
problem O
, O
however O
, O
is O
that O
authorities O
did O
not O
respond O
in O
the O
critical O
first O
few O
hours O
and O
days O
following O
the O
spill O
. O

This O
failure O
focused O
renewed O
attention O
on O
poor O
coordination O
between O
the O
central O
and O
local O
governments O
. O

In O
a O
public O
opinion O
poll O
, O
nearly B-PERCENT
70 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
respondents O
indicated O
dissatisfaction O
with O
the O
government O

handling O
of O
the O
oil O
spill O
. O

With O
today B-DATE
's O
huge O
volume O
of O
international O
shipping O
, O
oil O
spills O
are O
becoming O
a O
serious O
problem O
. O

Although O
the O
recent O
spill O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
was O
small O
in O
comparison O
with O
10,000 B-QUANTITY
- I-QUANTITY
ton I-QUANTITY
spills O
that O
have O
occurred O
elsewhere O
, O
the O
situation O
here O
is O
worrisome O
because O
, O
as O
a O
petroleum O
importer O
, O
oil O
tankers O
ply O
the O
waters O
around O
our O
island O
in O
swarms O
. O

There O
is O
no O
telling O
when O
the O
next O
spill O
might O
happen O
. O

While O
acknowledging O
the O
necessity O
of O
drafting O
emergency O
response O
plans O
, O
academics O
argue O
that O
an O
even O
more O
pressing O
task O
facing O
the O
government O
is O
to O
catalog O
Taiwan B-GPE
's O
marine O
resources O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
they O
say O
, O
it O
may O
be O
impossible O
to O
press O
reparation O
claims O
against O
shipping O
companies O
that O
accurately O
reflect O
the O
extent O
of O
damages O
. O

The O
lack O
of O
a O
detailed O
understanding O
of O
the O
Lungkeng B-GPE
ecology O
presents O
a O
perfect O
case O
in O
point O

Similarly O
, O
after O
the O
recent O
spate O
of O
forest O
fires O
in O
central O
and O
southern O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
scholars O
have O
again O
reacted O
by O
calling O
on O
the O
government O
to O
begin O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
with O
ongoing O
studies O
of O
Taiwan B-GPE

forest O
habitats O
. O

Investigations O
have O
shown O
that O
most O
of O
the O
recent O
forest O
fires O
plaguing O
Taiwan B-GPE
have O
been O
caused O
by O
campfires O
. O

Although O
the O
recent O

have O
been O
put O
out O
fairly O
quickly O
, O
a O
blaze O
on O

Forestry O

Under O

These O

The O

they O
owned O

you O

nonetheless O
take O
a O
different O
approach O
. O

Right O
now O
the O
most O
noteworthy O
foreign O
group O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
is O
California B-ORG
Fitness I-ORG
Centers I-ORG
, O
which O
now O
has O
three B-CARDINAL
gigantic O
branches O
. O

Asian B-NORP
regional O
CEO O
Eric B-PERSON
Levine I-PERSON
says O
that O
he O
does O
not O
agree O
with O
offering O
spa O
and O
aromatherapy O
facilities O
in O
a O
gym O
, O
because O
these O
encourage O
" O
laziness O
. O
" O

But O
it O
can O
not O
be O
denied O
that O
working O
out O
is O
a O
relatively O
new O
concept O
in O
Asia B-LOC
. O

Hence O
, O
California B-GPE
's O
approach O
is O
to O
make O
exercise O
" O
recreational O
" O
and O
" O
fashionable O
. O
" O

As O
Levine B-PERSON
explains O
: O
" O
We O
have O
deliberately O
put O
more O
lighting O
and O
decor O
into O
our O
Asian B-NORP
locations O
, O
and O
placed O
them O
in O
the O
busiest O
shopping O
districts O
, O
in O
hopes O
that O
working O
out O
will O
become O
fashionable O
, O
and O
going O
to O
the O
gym O
will O
be O
like O
going O
to O
a O
good O
pub O
. O

We O
want O
it O
to O
be O
more O
cool O
, O
more O
exciting O
, O
and O
more O
fun O
than O
a O
traditional O
gym O
, O
and O
for O
members O
to O
come O
to O
the O
center O
with O
the O
same O
attitude O
they O
take O
shopping O
for O
Chanel B-ORG
or O
Prada B-ORG
. O
" O

Levine B-PERSON
says O
that O
working O
out O
is O
already O
part O
of O
life O
in O
the O
West B-NORP
, O
so O
people O
do O
n't O
go O
to O
the O
gym O
to O
socialize O
. O

But O
Asians B-NORP
prefer O
group O
activities O
, O
and O
as O
a O
result O
California B-ORG
is O
putting O
more O
emphasis O
on O
aerobics O
classes O
, O
with O
classes O
every O
hour O
all O
day O
, O
so O
that O
members O
can O
join O
in O
any O
time O
. O

Each O
center O
also O
has O
dozens B-CARDINAL
of O
trainers O
who O
provide O
free O
advice O
or O
paid O
workout O
supervision O
. O

When O
East B-LOC
meets O
West B-LOC

No O
matter O
what O
tack O
operators O
may O
take O
to O
attract O
consumers O
, O
large O
health O
centers O
provide O
mainly O
the O
same O
services O
. O

Besides O
traditional O
equipment O
for O
weightlifting O
and O
cardio O
- O
pulmonary O
exercises O
, O
most O
have O
made O
aerobics O
the O
centerpiece O
in O
the O
new O
fitness O
fad O
. O

There O
are O
all O
kinds O
, O
such O
as O
martial O
arts O
aerobics O
, O
step O
aerobics O
, O
Latin B-NORP
aerobics O
, O
and O
weight O
- O
enhanced O
aerobics O
. O

As O
their O
names O
suggest O
, O
these O
classes O
modify O
traditional O
aerobic O
dance O
by O
adding O
martial O
arts O
moves O
, O
step O
platforms O
, O
Latin B-NORP
rhythms O
, O
dumbbells O
, O
and O
other O
props O
, O
thereby O
placing O
the O
focus O
of O
the O
workout O
on O
different O
muscle O
groups O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
aerobics O
centers O
commonly O
provide O
classes O
in O
Asian B-NORP
health O
techniques O
like O
yoga O
, O
tai O
- O
chi O
, O
and O
qigong O
. O

" O
Yoga O
and O
tai O
- O
chi O
have O
not O
been O
added O
just O
for O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
" O
says O
Eric B-PERSON
Levine I-PERSON
. O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
trend O
in O
fitness O
is O
toward O
a O
more O
Oriental B-NORP
approach O
, O
such O
as O
the O
inclusion O
of O
martial O
arts O
or O
" O
power O
yoga O
" O
into O
aerobics O
. O

There O
is O
little O
tradition O
of O
athletics O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
and O
it O
is O
too O
early O
to O
talk O
about O
any O
uniquely O
local O
forms O
that O
can O
be O
incorporated O
into O
Western B-NORP
workouts O
. O

But O
it O
is O
interesting O
to O
observe O
how O
differences O
in O
definitions O
of O
beauty O
have O
affected O
exercise O
preferences O
. O

Rex B-PERSON
, O
with O
his O
many O
years O
of O
training O
experience O
, O
finds O
it O
especially O
notable O
that O
" O
women O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
do O
n't O
really O
go O
for O
the O
American B-NORP
female O
approach O
of O
developing O
muscular O
bodies O
. O

They O
prefer O
lithe O
bodies O
, O
and O
as O
a O
result O
they O
are O
much O
more O
into O
aerobics O
than O
weight O
training O
. O

Most O
guys O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
meanwhile O
, O
focus O
on O
the O
upper O
body O
, O
and O
are O
looking O
for O
form O
, O
rather O
than O
aiming O
to O
be O
hugely O
muscular O
. O
" O

Healthy O
consumption O
? O

You O
might O
think O
that O
local O
health O
centers O
, O
with O
more O
attention O
to O
relaxation O
and O
" O
health O
cultivation O
, O
" O
would O
attract O
a O
higher O
age O
bracket O
, O
while O
foreign O
centers O
, O
with O
the O
accent O
on O
fashion O
and O
novelty O
, O
would O
draw O
the O
younger O
crowd O
. O

But O
these O
lines O
do O
not O
necessarily O
define O
how O
consumers O
choose O
. O

says O
that O
his O
main O
consideration O
in O
choosing O
a O
center O
was O
location O
and O
convenience O
. O

He O
does O
n't O
like O
the O
crowded O
feeling O
of O
the O

. O

" O
When O
you O
work O
out O
, O
the O
atmosphere O
should O
be O
calm O
, O
so O
that O
you O
can O
use O
different O
equipment O
when O
you O
need O

your O

that O
people O
who O

health O

are O
not O

suitable O

" O

so O
I O
tell O

The O
muscles O

less O

and O
unless O
a O
person O
has O
been O
working O
out O
since O
a O
young O
age O
, O
sudden O
intense O
exercise O
can O
lead O
to O
a O
deterioration O
of O
cartilage O
, O
with O
more O
damage O
than O
benefit O
for O
the O
body O
. O

As O
for O
children O
, O
they O
tend O
to O
think O
of O
exercise O
as O
just O
a O
kind O
of O
play O

with O
accidents O
often O
resulting O
because O

Dr. O

suggests O
that O
fitness O
should O
begin O

those O

very O

should O
stick O
to O
swimming O

exercise O

which O
are O
of O
moderate O
intensity O

And O
she O
adds O

" O
It O
's O
more O
natural O
just O
to O

when O

where O
you O
can O
in O

that O

Beating O
of O
children O
, O
often O
by O
an O
evil O

, O
is O
not O
unusual O
. O

This O
is O
not O
because O
Taiwanese B-NORP
are O
especially O
firm O
believers O
in O
corporal O
punishment O
. O

Rather O
this O
kind O

is O
a O

that O
has O
become O
attached O
to O
Taiwanese B-NORP

over O
the O
course O
of O
its O
history O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
even O
though O
" O
nativist O
drama O
" O
has O
escaped O
the O
stereotypical O
setting O
of O
the O
Taiwanese B-NORP
countryside O
of O
the O
past O
and O
increasingly O

" O
Taiwanese B-NORP

depict O
the O
daily O

" O

now O
, O
because O
of O
the O
trend O
in O
society O
of O
reviving O
Taiwanese B-LANGUAGE
as O
the O
mother O
tongue O
, O
Taiwanese B-NORP

has O
been O
able O

The O
8:00 B-TIME

time O
slot O
has O
long O
been O
the O
flagship O
and O
leading O
money O
maker O
for O
television O
stations O
. O

For O
a O
program O
to O
get O
into O
this O
slot O
, O
besides O
being O
commercially O
viable O
, O
in O
the O
past O
it O
also O
had O
to O
be O
politically O
correct O
. O

This O
used O
to O
mean O
: O
" O
No O
use O
of O
the O
Taiwanese B-LANGUAGE
language O
. O
" O

Because O
the O
government O
wanted O
to O
promote O
Mandarin B-LANGUAGE
, O
Taiwanese B-LANGUAGE
was O
officially O
seen O
as O
a O
rustic O
dialect O
, O
and O
was O
never O
eligible O
for O
prime O
time O
. O

The O
three B-CARDINAL
government O
- O
run O

of O
that O
era O

CTS O
-RRB- O
, O
and O
Taiwan B-ORG
Television I-ORG
-LRB- O
TTV O
-RRB- O
- O
had O
a O
tacit O
agreement O
that O
they O
would O
only O
show O
Taiwanese B-NORP
programs O
at O
noon B-TIME
or O
in O
the O
6:30 B-TIME
p.m. I-TIME
time O
slot O
, O
when O
most O
viewers O
would O
be O
housewives O
and O
elderly O
people O
. O

The O
programming O
for O
these O
time O
slots O
was O
low O
- O
budget O
, O
and O
the O
subject O
matter O
limited O
to O
ordinary O
life O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
's O
unsophisticated O
rural O
past O
, O
mostly O
tragic O
tales O
of O
mistreated O
daughters O
- O
in O
- O
law O
and O
the O
like O
, O
or O
family O
comedies O
. O

Thus O
, O
for O
a O
long O
time O
, O
Taiwanese B-NORP
drama O
gave O
people O
the O
impression O
of O
being O
lowbrow O
. O

It O
was O
not O
until O
1990 B-DATE
, O
with O
the O
broadcasting O
of O
the O
series O
Love B-WORK_OF_ART
on O
CTS B-ORG
, O
that O
the O
prime O
- O
time O
language O
taboo O
was O
even O
partly O
challenged O
. O

This O
series O
also O
raised O
the O
quality O
of O
Taiwanese B-NORP
drama O
, O
and O
planted O
the O
seeds O
for O
future O
efforts O
. O

The O
show O
was O
set O
against O
the O
background O
of O
the B-EVENT
August I-EVENT
7th I-EVENT
Flood I-EVENT
of I-EVENT
1959 I-EVENT
. O

The O
story O
portrayed O
how O
some O
Taiwanese B-NORP
and O
mainlanders O
went O
from O
mutual O
misunderstanding O
to O
mutual O
forgiveness O
. O

The O
performers O
spoke O
in O
both O
Mandarin B-LANGUAGE
and O
Taiwanese B-LANGUAGE
. O

Because O
the O
language O
taboo O
has O
long O
carried O
heavy O
political O
undertones O
- O
the O
opposition O
has O
always O
preferred O
the O
use O
of O
Taiwanese B-LANGUAGE
, O
the O
ruling O
party O
has O
, O
until O
recently O
, O
almost O
exclusively O
favored O
Mandarin B-LANGUAGE
- O
the O
producers O
invited O
many O
people O
from O
the O
arts O
community O
to O
confirm O
that O
Taiwanese B-LANGUAGE
was O
essential O
for O
the O
program O
, O
so O
as O
to O
dispel O
the O
suspicions O
of O
those O
who O
would O
see O
political O
motives O
behind O
language O
choice O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
effort O
was O
less O
than O
a O
complete O
success O
. O

For O
one O
thing O
, O
stereotypes O
remained O
strong O
, O
and O
Love B-WORK_OF_ART
still O
retained O
many O
of O
the O
old O
traditions O
, O
being O
a O
tragic O
small O
family O
drama O
focusing O
on O
a O
young O
bride O
facing O
hard O
times O
after O
moving O
into O
the O
husband O
's O
home O
. O

Moreover O
, O
because O
of O
opposition O
from O
high O
officials O
at O
the O
television O
network O
, O
after O
several O
episodes O
, O
the O
performers O
who O
had O
previously O
spoken O
in O
Taiwanese B-LANGUAGE
had O
their O
dialogue O
changed O
to O
" O
Mandarin B-LANGUAGE
with O
a O
Taiwanese B-LANGUAGE
accent O
. O
" O

However O
, O
because O
the O
plot O
was O
realistic O
, O
ratings O
were O
unprecedented O
, O
and O
Love B-WORK_OF_ART
even O
defeated O

the O

popular O
romance O
writer O
Chiung B-PERSON
Yao I-PERSON
, O
and O

on O

. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
many O
commentators O
suggested O
that O
Love B-WORK_OF_ART
was O
successful O
largely O
because O
of O
the O

, O
says O
that O
the O
real O
reason O
Love B-WORK_OF_ART
succeeded O
was O
because O
of O
its O
realistic O
depiction O
of O
the O
lives O
of O

. O

Her O
opinion O
is O
that O
" O
love O
stories O
involving O

dramatic O

are O
not O
the O

and O
Chiung B-PERSON

The O

all O

says O
that O
criticism O
of O
8:00 B-TIME

for O
being O
melodramatic O
is O
certainly O
not O
without O
foundation O
, O
yet O
, O
however O
people O
may O
criticize O
, O
there O
are O
still O
viewers O
who O
ca O
n't O
get O
enough O
. O

The O
audience O
is O
composed O
mainly O
of O
older O
folk O
and O
housewives O
. O

In O
general O
, O
they O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
watch O
something O
they O
have O
to O
really O
think O
too O
much O
about O

The O
simpler O
the O

and O
the O
plot O
, O
and O
the O
more O
conflict O
there O
is O
, O
the O
better O
. O

Lin B-PERSON
adds O
that O
intellectuals O
criticize O
such O
shows O
but O
in O
fact O
do O
n't O
watch O
TV O
. O

Television O
stations O
have O
always O
based O
their O
decisions O
on O
ratings O
, O
and O
it O
is O
virtually O
impossible O
to O
expect O
that O
they O
will O
change O
a O
proven O
formula O
. O

" O
Rather O
than O
say O
that O
serials O
are O
a O
mirror O
of O
life O
, O
it O
would O
be O
better O
to O
say O
that O
people O
identify O
with O
the O
characters O
in O
these O
dramas O
even O
if O
their O
own O
lives O
are O
not O
as O
dramatic O
. O
" O

These O
are O
the O
terms O
used O
by O
Tsai B-PERSON
Yen I-PERSON
, O
a O

in O
the O
department O
of O

This O
is O
particularly O
the O
case O
for O
older O
people O
and O
housewives O
. O

According O
to O
Tsai B-PERSON
, O
the O
formula O
for O
success O
revolves O
around O
romance O
or O
family O
relations O
. O

For O
dramatic O
effect O
, O
there O
need O
to O
be O
elements O
of O
hatred O
or O
revenge O
, O
and O
usually O
one O
irredeemably O
evil O
character O
whose O
purpose O
is O
to O
create O
obstacles O
to O
the O
romantic O
or O
career O
success O
of O
the O
main O
character O
. O

The O
focus O
is O
extremely O
narrow O
- O
personal O
achievement O
. O

Social O
issues O
serve O
only O
as O
background O
or O
embellishment O
. O

The O
daughter O
- O
in O
- O
law O
series O
precisely O
fits O
this O
structure O
. O

Realistic O
fashion O

After O
the O
daughter O

in O

series O
, O
there O
was O
a O
uniformity O
in O
dramatic O
serials O
all O
following O
the O
trend O
. O

Taiwanese B-NORP
drama O
went O
into O
a O
steady O
decline O
. O

However O
, O
just O
when O
things O
looked O
bleakest O
, O
nativist B-NORP
drama O
began O
to O
break O
out O
of O
its O
previous O
framework O
with O
the O
appearance O
of O
the O
" O

, O
characterized O
by O
a O
cross-generational O
story O
depicting O
long O

social O
evolution O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
. O

This O
format O
incorporates O
the O
rural O
themes O
of O
traditional O
Taiwanese B-NORP
drama O
, O
but O
the O
stories O
evolve O
with O
time O
, O
and O
also O
portray O
modern O

. O

Not O
only O
has O
this O
format O
given O
new O
life O
to O
Taiwanese B-NORP
drama O
, O
it O
has O
also O
pioneered O
an O
entirely O

of O

Twenty B-MONEY

inevitably O

Given O
the O
ever O
growing O
pluralization O
of O

This O
theme O
of O
tragedy O
resulting O
from O
changing O
times O
has O
appeared O
in O
Huang B-PERSON

earlier O
work O
, O
in O

In O

, O
" O
the O
age O
of O
the O
protagonist O
, O
Foolish B-PERSON
Chin I-PERSON
, O
is O
unclear O
, O
but O
the O
theme O
of O
obsolescence O
remains O
. O

Chin B-PERSON
's O
work O
- O
making O
announcements O
in O
the O
street O
while O
using O
a O
cymbal O
to O
attract O
attention O
- O
has O
been O
made O
obsolete O
by O
the O
spread O
of O
the O
megaphone O
, O
undercutting O
his O
social O
status O
and O
taking O
away O
his O
livelihood O
. O

Chin B-PERSON
thus O
takes O
on O
the O
role O
of O
a O
member O
of O
the O
older O
generation O
who O
has O
lost O
his O
struggle O
to O
make O
the O
transition O
to O
modern O
reality O
. O

Of O
necessity O
, O
his O
misfortune O
and O
his O
way O
of O
thinking O
have O
a O
very O
" O
old O
' O
character O
. O

There O
are O
reasons O
to O
look O
back O
to O
Huang B-PERSON
's O
early O
work O
. O

The O
first B-ORDINAL
is O
to O
point O
out O
that O
Letting B-WORK_OF_ART

Go I-WORK_OF_ART
- O
in O
which O
the O
protagonist O
of O
every O
story O
is O
an O
elderly O
person O
- O
is O
entirely O
of O
a O
piece O
with O
his O
other O
work O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
is O
a O
return O
to O
the O
main O
thread O
of O
his O
concerns O
of O
30 B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
. O

In O
the O
extremely O
nationalistic O
atmosphere O
of O
the O
1970s B-DATE
, O
Huang B-PERSON
changed O
his O
focus O
for O
a O
time O
, O
writing O
about O
the O
hatred O
of O
Japan B-GPE

. O

Although O
well O
received O
at O
the O
time O
they O
were O
written O
, O
these O
works O
were O
flawed O
. O

First B-ORDINAL
, O
they O
lacked O
the O
fine O
composition O
of O
true O
literature O
. O

Second B-ORDINAL
, O
in O
them O
Huang B-PERSON
had O
moved O
away O
from O
his O
greatest O
strength O
, O
the O
characters O
and O
settings O
with O
which O
he O
was O
truly O
familiar O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
Huang B-PERSON
's O
1970s B-DATE
writings O
were O
simply O
records O
of O
the O
period O
in O
which O
they O
were O
written O
and O
creative O
experiments O
. O

They O
are O
interesting O
in O
their O
own O
way O
, O
but O
are O
by O
no O
means O
among O
his O
best O
works O
. O

Two B-CARDINAL
generations O
removed O

The O
second B-ORDINAL
reason O
to O
look O
back O
at O
Huang B-PERSON
's O
early O
fiction O
is O
to O
highlight O
the O
continuity O
of O
Letting B-WORK_OF_ART
Them I-WORK_OF_ART
Go I-WORK_OF_ART
. O

Although O
it O
has O
been O
more O
than O
ten O
years O
since O
Huang B-PERSON
's O
last O
collection O
of O

" O

Window I-WORK_OF_ART
, O
" O
there O
is O
something O
at O
the O
core O
of O
Huang B-PERSON
's O
fiction O
which O
has O
not O
changed O
. O

In O
his O
introduction O
to O
Letting B-WORK_OF_ART
Them I-WORK_OF_ART
Go I-WORK_OF_ART
, O
Huang B-PERSON
mentions O
his O
deep O
distress O
at O
the O
plight O
of O
the O
elderly O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
today B-TIME
, O
notes O
that O
he O
himself O
is O
just O
beginning O
to O
enter O
his O
twilight O
years O
, O
and O
compares O
Taiwan B-GPE
's O
callous O
treatment O
of O
the O
elderly O
to O
the O
way O
in O
which O
the O
elderly O
were O
left O
to O
live O
or O
die O
on O
their O
own O
in O
the O
mountains O
in O
You B-WORK_OF_ART
Shan I-WORK_OF_ART

Kao I-WORK_OF_ART
. O

All O
of O
this O
could O
very O
easily O
give O
the O
reader O
the O
mistaken O
impression O
that O
Huang B-PERSON
's O
vision O
of O
the O
elderly O
is O
a O
new O
development O
. O

But O
this O
is O
simply O
not O
the O
case O
. O

In O
Letting B-WORK_OF_ART
Them I-WORK_OF_ART
Go I-WORK_OF_ART
, O
what O
we O
are O
actually O
seeing O
is O
the O
rebirth O
of O
Huang B-PERSON
's O
original O
passion O
. O

If O
there O
has O
been O
any O
change O
in O
his O
portrayal O
of O
old O
people O
over O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
37 I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
it O
is O
only O
in O
perspective O
. O

He O
used O
to O
write O
of O
grandfathers O
from O
the O
point O
of O
view O
of O
grandsons O
. O

Now O
he O
is O
a O
grandfather O
himself O
. O

Huang B-PERSON
Chun I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
ming I-PERSON
has O
often O
discussed O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
was O
raised O
largely O
by O
his O
grandparents O
, O
and O
that O
he O
had O
an O
unusually O
close O
relationship O
to O
them O
. O

This O
background O
accounts O
for O
the O
unique O
" O
generation O
gap O
" O
approach O
utilized O
by O
Huang B-PERSON
in O
his O
fiction O
. O

Each O
of O
Huang B-PERSON
's O
works O
describes O
a O
particular O
person O
or O
thing O
, O
and O
has O
an O
" O
implied O
reader O
" O
at O
which O
it O
is O
directed O
. O

In O
the O
past O
, O
Huang B-PERSON
's O
" O
generation O
gap O
" O
separated O
him O
from O
the O
people O
he O
was O
writing O
about O
- O
people O
of O
his O
grandparents O
' O
generation O
, O
two B-CARDINAL
generations O
removed O
from O
his O
own O
. O

Now O
, O
this O
" O
generation O
gap O
" O
stands O
between O
him O
and O
the O
" O
implied O
reader O
" O
of O
his O
fiction O
- O
children O
of O
his O
grandchildren O
's O
generation O
who O
are O
ignorant O
of O
traditional O
wisdom O
. O

Another O
aspect O
of O
Huang B-PERSON
's O
work O
is O
that O
it O
presents O
many O
of O
the O
characteristics O
sociology O
attributes O
to O
relationships O
between O
people O
two B-CARDINAL
generations O
removed O
from O
one O
another O
. O

For O
example O
, O
such O
relationships O
are O
not O
usually O
as O
tense O
, O
direct O
or O
hurried O
as O
those O
between O
parents O
and O
children O
because O
grandparents O
are O
not O
as O
busy O
as O
parents O
, O
and O
have O
less O
responsibility O
to O
supervise O
and O
teach O
. O

Also O
, O
difficulties O
in O
communication O
between O
grandparents O
and O
grandchildren O
frequently O
arise O
because O
of O
the O
very O
different O
modes O
of O
expression O
employed O
by O
each O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
there O
are O
typically O
more O
miscommunications O
in O
such O
relationships O
than O
there O
are O
between O
parents O
and O
their O
children O
. O

A O
soft O
heart O

Viewing O
Huang B-PERSON
's O
fiction O
in O
this O
way O
, O
we O
can O
perhaps O
more O
clearly O
see O
wherein O
lies O
its O
charm O
. O

Huang B-PERSON
is O
never O
derisive O
or O
critical O
of O
his O
elderly O
characters O
. O

If O
we O
compare O
him O
to O
other O
Nativist B-NORP
writers O
who O
address O
the O
tragedy O
of O
the O
rural O
elderly O
unable O
to O
adapt O
to O
the O
modern O
industrial O
world O
, O
we O
note O
that O
Huang B-PERSON
is O
reluctant O
to O
expose O
his O
elderly O
characters O
to O
unmitigated O
suffering O
. O

Other O
Nativist B-NORP
writers O
use O
stories O
of O
suffering O
and O
pitiable O
elderly O
persons O
to O
make O
the O
case O
for O
reform O
. O

Huang B-PERSON
takes O
a O
much O
gentler O
approach O
- O
not O
because O
he O
thinks O
the O
modern O
world O
a O
perfect O
place O
, O
but O
because O
he O
can O
not O
bear O
to O
be O
so O
harsh O
. O

Huang B-PERSON
's O
tender O
- O
heartedness O
is O
apparent O
to O
the O
reader O
of O
his O
work O
. O

In O
his O
fiction O
, O
Huang B-PERSON
is O
both O
more O
sensitive O
to O
and O
places O
greater O
importance O
on O
the O
elderly O
's O
haphazard O
means O
of O
expressing O
affection O
than O
are O
other O
Nativist B-NORP
writers O
. O

" O
Fish B-WORK_OF_ART
, O
" O
one O
of O
his O
early O
works O
, O
has O
become O
very O
widely O
known O
since O
being O
incorporated O
into O
the O
national O
middle O
- O
school O
literature O
curriculum O
. O

The O
story O
describes O
an O
unexpected O
conflict O
that O
arises O
out O
of O
a O
misunderstanding O
between O
a O
child O
and O
a O
grandfather O
who O
care O
deeply O
for O
one O
another O
. O

Similar O
sorts O
of O
emotions O
are O
expressed O
in O
" O
Letting B-WORK_OF_ART
Them I-WORK_OF_ART
Go I-WORK_OF_ART
" O
as O
well O
. O

In O
this O
later O
story O
, O
the O
elderly O
Ah B-PERSON
- I-PERSON

inexplicably O
goes O
out O
and O
catches O
an O
egret O
, O
then O
just O
as O
inexplicably O
lets O
it O
go O
. O

Both O
of O
these O
actions O
are O
indirect O
expressions O
of O
a O
deep O
love O
he O
can O
not O
give O
voice O
to O
yet O
nonetheless O
feels O
for O
his O
son O
Wen B-PERSON

. O

A O
smile O
and O
a O
tear O

When O
Huang B-PERSON
writes O
of O
sad O
events O
, O
his O
readers O
' O
eyes O
really O
do O
fill O
with O
tears O
. O

However O
, O
the O
most O
exceptional O
thing O
about O
Huang B-PERSON
as O
a O
writer O
is O
that O
he O
is O
not O
satisfied O
with O
making O
his O
readers O
cry O
. O

He O
wants O
every O
tear O
that O
falls O
to O
be O
accompanied O
by O
a O
small O
smile O
. O

And O
he O
is O
able O
to O
have O
it O
both O
ways O
because O
of O
the O
deep O
and O
tender O
sympathy O
of O
his O
work O
. O

The O
stories O
in O
Letting B-WORK_OF_ART
Them I-WORK_OF_ART
Go I-WORK_OF_ART
are O
filled O
with O
elderly O
characters O
. O

Some O
are O

and O

like O

" O
full O
of O
a O
wisdom O
unsuited O
to O
the O

. O

Their O
tragedy O
is O
that O
they O
are O
out O
of O

the O
times O

that O
they O
do O
not O
know O
how O
to O
adapt O
to O
this O
cold O
and O
chaotic O
new O
society O
. O

The O
comedy O
of O
their O
predicament O
grows O
out O
of O
their O
unwillingness O
to O
let O
go O
of O
the O
" O

in O

we O
see O
a O

And O
in O

Sun B-GPE

first B-ORDINAL
hit O
last O
June O
, O
caused O
an O
immediate O
sensation O
. O

The O
critic O
G B-PERSON
Moon I-PERSON
praised O
it O
as O
a O
marvelous O
blend O
of O
seemingly O
familiar O
melody O
and O
lyrics O
, O
with O
solo O
piano O
accompaniment O
from O
start O
to O
finish O
. O

People O
found O
Sun B-PERSON
's O
singing O
voice O
fresh O
, O
clean O
and O
infectiously O
charming O
, O
and O
it O
quickly O
earned O
her O
a O
place O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
's O
music O
world O
. O

Fresh O
and O
clean O

Sun B-PERSON
clearly O
occupies O
an O
enviable O
position O
in O
the O
singing O
world O
. O

Yet O
it O
is O
hard O
to O
pin O
down O
exactly O
where O
that O
position O
is O
. O

Although O
she O
has O
written O
a O
few O
songs O
herself O
, O
these O
are O
not O
among O
her O
better O
works O
, O
so O
she O
can O
not O
be O
properly O
placed O
among O
the O
" O
singer O
- O
songwriters O
. O
" O

And O
while O
her O
voice O
sets O
her O
apart O
, O
she O
has O
not O
perfected O
her O
live O
performance O
skills O
, O
so O
she O
can O
not O
be O
included O
among O
the O
true O
divas O
. O

Moreover O
, O
her O
short O
hair O
, O
buck O
teeth O
and O
aversion O
to O
wearing O
skirts O
and O
dresses O
would O
seem O
to O
exclude O
her O
from O
the O
teeny O
- O
bopper O
" O
idols O
. O
" O

Finally O
, O
she O
ca O
n't O
be O
considered O
an O
innovator O
. O

Half B-CARDINAL
her O
songs O
are O
slow O
and O
half O
are O
fast O
, O
and O
she O
has O
n't O
revealed O
much O
desire O
to O
experiment O
. O

Indeed O
, O
Internet O

are O
full O

wondering O
why O

Her O

" O
She O

not O

her O
smile O

She O

the O

with O

providing O
songs O
that O

stop O

This O

allowed O
her O

stand O
apart O
from O

who O
just O
blindly O
follow O

Hence O
, O
though O

neither O

Sun B-PERSON

two B-CARDINAL

sold O
very O

quipped O
that O

Li B-PERSON
, O
for O
any O
bonuses O
they O
made O
last B-DATE

Now O
people O
have O
started O
wondering O
if O
overseas O
Chinese B-NORP
from O
Southeast B-LOC
Asia I-LOC
- O
and O
in O
particular O
from O
Singapore B-GPE
and O
Malaysia B-GPE
- O
are O
taking O
over O
the O
mainstream O
of O
the O
Taiwanese B-NORP
music O
industry O
. O

In O
earlier O
decades O
Southeast B-NORP
Asian I-NORP
singers O
were O
unusual O
here O
. O

In O
the B-DATE
1970s I-DATE
and I-DATE
1980s I-DATE
there O
was O
Teng B-PERSON
Miao I-PERSON

and O
Wen B-PERSON
Chang I-PERSON
. O

Then O
Eric B-PERSON
Moo I-PERSON
appeared O
on O
the O
scene O
in O
the B-DATE
1990s I-DATE
. O

Although O
these O
were O
all O
successful O
singers O
, O
they O
comprised O
a O
small O
group O
. O

But O
in O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
five I-DATE
years I-DATE
or I-DATE
so I-DATE
, O
there O
has O
been O
a O
steady O
stream O
of O
Southeast B-NORP
Asian I-NORP
singers O
making O
their O
mark O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE

, O
almost O
all O

them O
have O
been O
described O

even O

Although O
the B-NORP

Asians I-NORP
have O
n't O
had O
quite O
the O
impact O
of O
the O
returning O
overseas O
Chinese B-NORP
from O
North B-LOC
America I-LOC
, O
they O
have O
staked O
out O
their O
piece O
of O
the O
pop O
music O
field O
. O

Music O
critic O
Tsai B-PERSON

notes O
that O
the O
Southeast B-NORP
Asian I-NORP
singers O
are O
not O
as O
recognizable O
as O
their O
counterparts O
from O
North B-LOC
America I-LOC
, O
who O
have O
a O
hard O

rocking O

R&B O
style O

The O
simple O
and O
catchy O
melodies O
and O
rhythms O
of O
the B-NORP
Southeast I-NORP
Asians I-NORP
sound O
a O
lot O
like O
those O
of O
the O
locals O
. O

Taiwanese B-NORP
listeners O
quickly O
identify O
with O
these O
singers O
and O
may O
even O
forget O
where O
they O
come O
from O
. O

" O
Taiwan B-GPE
is O
now O
the O
capital O
of O
Mandarin B-LANGUAGE

, O
" O
says O

" O
If O
there O

' O
then O
there O

" O

The O
market O
is O
too O
small O
in O

so O
it O
has O
become O
de O
rigueur O
for O
Southeast B-NORP
Asian I-NORP
Chinese B-NORP

to O
come O
to O
Taiwan B-GPE
to O

argues O
that O
the O
growing O
dominance O
of O
multi-national O
companies O

has O
fostered O
uniformity O

Asians I-NORP
have O
been O
able O
to O
step O

greater O

Yet O
though O
their O
music O
may O
be O
" O
fresher O

" O
on O
close O

it O
does O
n't O
really O
differ O
that O
much O
from O
what O
is O
produced O

It O
is O
, O
after O
all O
, O
produced O
for O
the O

Although O
there O
may O
not O
be O
much O
that O
sets O
the B-NORP

apart O
, O
the O
growing O
exchange O
of O
musical O
talent O
between O
Taiwan B-GPE
and O
Southeast B-LOC
Asia I-LOC
has O
at O

provided O
ample O
content O

When O

A O
believer O
in O
the O
possibility O

, O
the O

once O
dispatched O
a O
trusted O

on O
a O
voyage O
across O
the O

to O
search O
for O
magic O

that O
would O

Perhaps O
as O

" O
he O
also O
poured O
vast O
resources O
into O
the O
construction O
of O

with O
all O
the O
accoutrements O
that O
he O
was O
accustomed O
to O
in O
the O
here O
and O
now O
. O

The O
population O
of O
the O
kingdom O
of O
Qin B-PERSON
at O
that O
time O
was O
about B-CARDINAL
20 I-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
, O
of O
whom O
over O
2 B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
were O
mobilized O
to O
bring O
his O
grand O
underground O
palace O
to O
completion O
. O

Now O
that O
the O
complex O
has O
been O
discovered O
, O
it O
is O
unquestionably O
the O
life O
- O
size O
terracotta O
warriors O
and O
horses O
that O
inspire O
the O
most O
amazement O
. O

The O
8,000 B-CARDINAL
figures O
that O
have O
been O
unearthed O
at O
the O
site O
in O
Shaanxi B-GPE
Province I-GPE
were O
all O
executed O
with O
painstaking O
realism O
. O

The O
rank O
of O
each O
figure O
determined O
every O
little O
detail O
of O
its O
making O
, O
right O
down O
to O
the O
type O
of O
military O
uniform O
, O
cap O
, O
armor O
, O
hairstyle O
, O
and O
beard O
. O

Artisans O
even O
incised O
the O
soles O
of O
the O
soldiers O
' O
shoes O
to O
show O
the O
threads O
, O
and O
made O
sure O
the O
horses O
' O
teeth O
were O
realistically O
done O
. O

Each O
face O
is O
unique O
. O

Some O
characters O
project O
an O
air O
of O
stern O
authority O
. O

Others O
suggest O
a O
fierce O
and O
violent O
personality O
. O

Still O
other O
faces O
clearly O
belong O
to O
tender O
, O
untested O
young O
greenhorns O
. O

The O
tremendous O
individuality O
in O
the O
warriors O
never O
fails O
to O
amaze O
. O

Indeed O
, O
there O
are O
people O
who O
subscribe O
to O
the O
rumor O
that O
each O
clay O
figure O
encloses O
the O
corpse O
of O
a O
real O
person O
. O

Careful O
inspection O
of O
the O
markings O
on O
the O
figures O
reveals O
that O
about O
90 B-CARDINAL
" O
master O
craftsmen O
" O
participated O
in O
the O
making O
of O
the O
terracotta O
warriors O
, O
each O
supported O
by O
a O
team O
of O
ten O
or O
more O
assistants O
. O

The O
total O
number O
of O
artisans O
involved O
probably O
came O
to O
nearly O
a O
thousand B-CARDINAL
. O

Some O
of O
them O
were O
employed O
by O
imperial O
kilns O
, O
while O
others O
came O
from O
private O
establishments O
. O

It O
was O
a O
huge O
undertaking O
, O
for O
each O
figure O
had O
to O
be O
shaped O
, O
molded O
, O
kneaded O
, O
sculpted O
, O
and O
painted O
. O

Decorative O
relief O
elements O
had O
to O
be O
applied O
. O

The O
figures O
had O
to O
be O
covered O
with O
an O
off O
- O
white O
slip O
to O
approximate O
the O
color O
of O
skin O
. O

The O
hair O
, O
too O
, O
had O
to O
be O
appropriately O
colored O
. O

Even O
the O
horses O
were O
painted O
in O
appropriate O
shades O
of O
reddish O
- O
brown O
and O
black O
. O

Their O
tongues O
were O
done O
in O
pink O
, O
and O
their O
teeth O
in O
white O
. O

The O
soldiers O
stand O
a O
surprising O
180 B-QUANTITY
centimeters I-QUANTITY
in O
height O
, O
prompting O
many O
to O
ask O
whether O
the O
men O
of O
that O
time O
were O
actually O
taller O
than O
their O
modern O
counterparts O
. O

There O
are O
two B-CARDINAL
different O
theories O
concerning O
this O
question O
, O
says O
Wu B-PERSON
Yongqi I-PERSON
, O
the O
head O
of O
the B-ORG
Museum I-ORG
of I-ORG
Terracotta I-ORG
Warriors I-ORG
. O

In O
Taipei B-GPE
for O
the O
exhibit O
, O
Wu B-PERSON
explains O
that O
some O
say O
it O
is O
natural O
that O
the O
figures O
should O
be O
taller O
since O
people O
from O
China B-GPE
's O
northwest O
- O
where O
the O
Qin B-PERSON
kingdom O
was O
located O
- O
have O
always O
been O
taller O
than O
other O
Chinese B-NORP
. O

Others O
, O
however O
, O
theorize O
that O
the O
artisans O
intentionally O
made O
the O
figures O
slightly O
larger O
than O
life O
to O
compensate O
for O
the O
shrinkage O
that O
would O
take O
place O
while O
the O
freshly O
molded O
figures O
were O
drying O
. O

But O
if O
you O
visit O
the O
exhibit O
, O
do O
n't O
be O
so O
dazzled O
by O
the O
terracotta O

that O

stated O
after O
visiting O
the O

that O
most O
of O
our O
knowledge O
concerning O
the O
Qin B-PERSON
dynasty O
comes O
from O
official O
dynastic O
histories O
authored O
during O
the O
Han B-NORP
period O
. O

These O
later O
authors O
generally O
had O
a O
jaundiced O
view O
of O
the O
Qin B-PERSON
, O
and O
tended O
to O
focus O
on O
the O
ruthless O
, O
autocratic O
rule O
of O
Qin B-PERSON
Shi I-PERSON
Huang I-PERSON
while O
paying O
less O
attention O
to O
the O
positive O
achievements O
of O
Qin B-PERSON
culture O
, O
or O
the O
beauty O
of O
Qin B-PERSON

An O

In O

with O
the O

At O
an O
age O
when O

busy O
at O

, O
Wang B-PERSON
used O
to O
bury O
himself O

for O
hours O
on O

in O
the O

Like O
all O
Chinese B-NORP
children O

Wang B-PERSON
began O
by O
imitating O
the O

He O
went O
on O

the O

progressing O
in O
his O

At O

could O
about O
Western B-NORP

However O
, O
perhaps O
due O

his O
familiarity O

what O
was O

Wang B-PERSON
did O

the O
skills O

requiring O

the O

was O
highly O

about O

Wang B-PERSON
performed O
all O
with O
equal O
facility O

Hsueh B-PERSON
Ping I-PERSON

nan I-PERSON
recalls O
how O
he O
once O
watched O
Wang B-PERSON
carving O
seals O
in O
his O
study O
, O
first B-ORDINAL
giving O
careful O
thought O
to O
the O
layout O
and O
making O
draft O
after O
draft O
on O
paper O
. O

Having O
settled O
on O
a O
layout O
, O
he O
would O
then O
carve O
the O
seal O
in O
one B-CARDINAL
go O
, O
using O
the O
knife O
with O
fluid O
ease O
. O

Thus O
it O
was O
that O
he O
could O
fill O
the O
confined O
space O
on O
a O
seal O
with O
expansive O
, O
forceful O
- O
looking O
characters O
. O

What O
people O
admired O
most O
about O
Wang B-PERSON
was O
his O
ability O
to O
wield O
the O
knife O
like O
a O
writing O
brush O
, O
carving O
lines O
that O
seemed O
free O
and O
flowing O
. O

Every O
stroke O
was O
made O
with O
one B-CARDINAL
cut O
of O
the O
blade O
- O
in O
contrast O
to O
most O
seal O
carvers O
who O
need O
two B-CARDINAL
cuts O
to O
achieve O
the O
appearance O
of O
a O
brush O
stroke O
. O

This O
was O
especially O
so O
of O
his O
signature O
mark O
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
seal O
. O

Careful O
examination O
of O
Wang B-PERSON
's O
seals O
shows O
that O
the O
running O
script O
of O
the O
signature O
mark O
is O
carved O
with O
every O
bit O
as O
much O
grace O
and O
fluidity O
as O
if O
done O
by O
brush O
and O
ink O
, O
but O
augmented O
by O
the O
hardness O
that O
is O
intrinsic O
to O
stone O
inscriptions O
. O

For O
individuality O
of O

carving O

explains O
that B-NORP
the O
art O
of O
Chinese B-PERSON
calligraphy O
can O
broadly O
be O
divided B-PERSON
into I-PERSON
two O
main O
branches O
: O
the O
nantie O
, O
or O
Southern O
style O
, O
in O
which O
beauty O
of O
form O
is O
emphasized O
, O
and O
the O
more O
rugged O
beibei O
or O
Northern O
style O
. O

Wang O
Chuang O
- O
wei O
established O
his O
style O
relatively O
early O
, O
and O
up O
until O
he O
was O
in O
his O
forties O
his O
works O
were O
characterized O
by O
the O
smooth O
, O
fluid O
forms O
of O
the O
nantie O
style O
. O

However O
, O
Wang O
himself O
was O
alert O
to O
the O
risk O
of O
his O
calligraphy O
becoming O
over-refined O
, O
and O
he O
began O
incorporating O
the O
robustness O
of O
the O
beibei O
style O
into B-PERSON
his O
brushwork O
, O
aiming B-CARDINAL
for B-NORP
a O
style O
that O
was B-GPE
more O
" O
raw O
and O
intense O
. O
" O

As B-ORDINAL
a O
result O
, O
his O
calligraphy O
came O
to O
combine O
fluid B-WORK_OF_ART
grace I-WORK_OF_ART
with I-WORK_OF_ART
a I-WORK_OF_ART
core O
of O
doughty O
toughness O
. O

It O
was O
a O
style O
well O
suited O
to O
the O
kind B-ORG
of I-ORG
man I-ORG
he O
was O
: O
a O
bluff O
northerner O
with O
the O
perfectionist O
's O
approach O
to O
art O
. O

When O
he O
was O
in O
his O
fifties O
Wang O
came O
to O
regard O
" O
writing O
characters O
" O
as O
a O
form O
of O
painting O
, O
and O
he O
began O
to O
innovate O
and B-GPE
experiment O
with O
the O
art O
. O

For O
example O
, O
he O
created O
" O
multiple O
- O
shadow O
" O
calligraphy O
, O
in O
which O
characters O
were O
painted O
in O
five O
overlapping O
layers O
using O
different O
consistencies O
of O
ink O
. O

He O
tried O
using B-GPE
deliberately O
crumpled O
paper O
to O
produce B-DATE
a O
mottled O
effect O
with O
the O
ink O
, O
and O
worked O
on O
a O
blurring O
effect O
, O
achieved O
by O
briefly O
dousing O
a O
freshly O
painted B-NORP
silk O
scroll O
in O
water O
. O

Despite O
the O
interest B-ORG
generated B-ORG
among B-ORG
calligraphers I-ORG
by O
these B-ORG
innovations I-ORG
, O
Wang O
was O
more O
suited O
by O
temperament O
to O
the O
established O
forms O
, O
and O
he O
eventually O
turned O
back O
to O
ancients O
for O
inspiration O
. O

He O
studied O
in O
detail O
the O
characters O
on O
the O

dating O
back O

first O

time O
being O
unearthed O
at O
Mawangdui O

in O
mainland O
China O
, O
and O
began O
absorbing O
their O
distinctive O
forms O
into O
his O
own O
calligraphic O
style O
. O

He O
also O
made O
poems O
and O
paired O

couplets O
out O
of O
the O
ancient O

, O
pioneering O
a O

something O

" O
During O
this O
period O
his O

with O
his O
vast O
erudition O

deep O
knowledge O
of O

often O

For O

Sometimes O

who O

a O

, O
recalls O
how O
he O
once O
asked O
Wang B-PERSON
to O
re-inscribe O
an O
old O
seal O
Huang B-PERSON
had O
picked O
up O
on O
an O
antiques O
stall O

Wang B-PERSON
first B-ORDINAL
asked O
: O
" O
Are O
you O
sure O
you O
want O
the O
original O
inscription O
ground O
off O

" O

Without O
thinking O
twice O
about O
it O
, O
Huang B-PERSON
said O
yes O
. O

Only O
when O
Huang B-PERSON
came O
to O
collect O
it O
did O
Wang B-PERSON
tell O
him O
that O
the O
re-inscribed O
seal O
, O
which O
originally O
read O
: O
" O
Roaming O

Huang B-PERSON
was O
left O
fuming O

Forgetting O
the O
self O

When O
he O
was O
in O
his B-DATE
sixties I-DATE
Wang B-PERSON
began O
to O
use O
the O
style O
names O
Jianzhai B-PERSON
-LRB- O
" O
steadily O

" O
-RRB- O
and O
Jiansou B-PERSON
-LRB- O
" O
steadily O
older O
" O
-RRB- O
, O
and O
carved O
a O
seal O
for O
himself O
with O
the O
inscription O
: O
" O
Steadily O
older O
and O
more O
mature O
, O
steadily O
more O
mature O
and O
more O
detached O
, O
steadily O
more O
detached O
and O
closer O
to O
what O
is O
plain O
and O
natural O
. O
" O

During O
his B-DATE
fifties I-DATE
he O
had O
passed O
through O
a O
period O
of O
experimentation O
and O
innovation O
, O
" O
being O
different O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
it O
, O
" O
but O
now O
he O
returned O
to O
the O
traditional O
artistic O
way O
of O
" O
being O
naturally O
different O
. O
" O

Wang B-PERSON
once O
said O
that O
an O
artistic O
aesthetic O
is O
something O
that O
emerges O
through O
long O
years O
of O
stylistic O
refinement O
and O
expression O
. O

Every O
artist O
goes O
through O
a O
non-stop O
process O
of O
evolution O
, O
accumulating O
a O
kind O
of O
natural O
grace O
as O
time O
goes O
by O
. O

If O
old O
age O
enabled O
Wang B-PERSON
to O
become O
" O
steadily O
more O
proficient O
" O
- O
as O
Buddhism B-NORP
would O
have O
it O
- O
at O
his O
art O
, O
it O
also O
made O
him O
" O
steadily O
more O
forgetful O
. O
" O

Sometimes O
, O
when O
tidying O
up O
works O
of O
poetry O
from O
years O
before O
, O
he O
would O
come O
across O
one O
that O
he O
had O
no O
recollection O
of O
ever O
writing O
. O

This O
did O
n't O
depress O
him O
, O
however O
. O

On O
the O
contrary O
, O
he O
considered O
it O
an O
advantage O
of O
memory O
loss O
that O
it O
enabled O
him O
to O
look O
more O
objectively O
at O
his O
own O
works O
, O
as O
if O
someone O
else O
had O
written O
them O
. O

With O
this O
in O
mind O
he O
came O
up O
with O
another O
style O
name O
for O
himself O
: O
" O
Forgetful O
old O
man O
. O
" O

Eventually O
he O
came O
to O
forget O
almost O
everything O
that O
had O
ever O
happened O
to O
him O
, O
both O
the O
sorrows O
and O
the O
joys O
. O

After O
a O
lifetime O
dedicated O
to O
the O
pursuit O
of O
art O
, O
Wang B-PERSON
at O
last O
entered O
that O
state O
of O
freedom O
in O
which O
" O
the O
man O
and O
his O
calligraphy O
have O
both O
attained O
maturity O
. O
" O

When O
Wang B-PERSON
was O
young O
he O
once O
wrote O
the O
following O
lines O
on O
seeing O
the O
work O
of O
an O
ancient O

at O

: O

Heading O
the O

presenting O

Cabinet B-ORG

arguments O
to O
the O
Grand O
Justices O
was O
Hsu B-PERSON
Tsung I-PERSON

. O

Hsu B-PERSON
notes O
that O
while O
the O
ruling O
pointed O
to O
procedural O
flaws O
in O
the O
Cabinet B-ORG
's O
action O
, O
the O
ruling O
said O
nothing O
about O
any O
violation O
of O
the O
constitution O
or O
the O
law O
. O

The O
Grand O
Justices O
, O
argues O
Hsu B-PERSON
, O
felt O
that O
the O
dispute O
could O
be O
resolved O
by O
having O
the O
premier O
present O
a O
report O
to O
the O
legislature O
, O
or O
through O
consultations O
between O
the O
legislature O
and O
the O
cabinet O
. O

However O
, O
said O
Hsu B-PERSON
, O
since O
the O
government O
has O
not O
necessarily O
built O
up O
a O
consensus O
in O
support O
of O
its O
stance O
against O
nuclear O
power O
, O
another O
option O
might O
be O
to O
have O
the O
premier O
resign O
, O
disband O
the O
legislature O
, O
and O
elect O
a O
new O
legislature O
so O
that O
the O
public O
can O
express O
its O
will O
regarding O
the O
issue O
. O

If O
other O
constitutional O
rulings O
in O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
two I-DATE
years I-DATE
are O
any O
guide O
, O
it O
appears O
that O
the O
dispute O
between O
the O
ruling O
and O
opposition O
camps O
will O
have O
to O
be O
resolved O
in O
the O
political O
arena O
. O

Last B-DATE
March I-DATE
the O
Grand O
Justices O
rendered O
a O
constitutional O
interpretation O
when O
the O
ruling O
and O
opposition O
parties O
were O
wrangling O
over O
a O
proposed O
term O
extension O
for O
all O
members O
of O
the B-ORG
National I-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
. O

The O
justices O
ruled O
that O
the O
decision O
making O
process O
violated O
the B-ORG
National I-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
's I-ORG
rules O
of O
order O
and O
went O
against O
the O
principle O
that O
all O
decisions O
must O
be O
open O
and O
transparent O
. O

After O
the O
term O
extension O
was O
declared O
invalid O
, O
retaliatory O
constitutional O
amendments O
were O
proposed O
in O
the B-ORG
National I-ORG

to O
abolish O
the B-ORG
Council I-ORG
of I-ORG
Grand I-ORG
Justices I-ORG

strip O
the O

their O
lifetime O

In O
1996 B-DATE
, O
the O
Grand O
Justices O

on O
the O
constitutionality O

the O
plan O
to O
have O
then O
- O
Vice O
President O
Lien B-PERSON
Chan I-PERSON
serve O
concurrently O
as O
premier O
. O

The O
justices O
issued O
an O
ambiguous O
ruling O
stating O
that O
while O
the O
plan O
was O
not O
unconstitutional O
, O
neither O
was O
it O
was O
appropriate O
. O

After O
the O
ruling O
was O
announced O
, O
the O
ruling O
and O
opposition O
camps O
both O
declared O
victory O
and O
eventually O
negotiated O
an O
agreement O
on O
the O
question O
of O
whether O
Lien B-PERSON
Chan I-PERSON
would O
be O
allowed O
to O
serve O
as O
premier O
. O

The O
ruling O
and O
opposition O
camps O
have O
now O
agreed O
that O
Premier O
Chang B-PERSON
should O
present O
a O
report O
to O
the O
legislature O
, O
but O
the O
question O
of O
whether O
to O
resume O
construction O
of O
the O
power O
plant O
remains O
a O
focus O
of O
contention O

How O

Nevertheless O
, O
Mr. O
Chen B-PERSON
has O
deep O
confidence O
, O
" O
As O
long O
as O
our O
tea O
is O
good O
, O
we O
need O
n't O
fear O
that O
no O

one O

The O

, O
does O
n't O
hide O
his O
pride O
in O
and O
his O
concerns O
about O
Pinglin B-GPE
's O
tea O
industry O
. O

Says O
Liang B-PERSON
, O
" O
Here O
in O
Pinglin B-GPE
we O
worship O
tea O
as O
a O
god O
. O

We O
look O
after O
it O
like O
a O
sweetheart O
. O
" O

As O
well O
as O
encouraging O
the O
local O
people O
to O
constantly O
enhance O
their O
tea O
growing O
and O
processing O
skills O
, O
he O
devotes O
even O
more O
energy O
to O
managing O
the O
" O
tea O
culture O

to O
which O
tea O
has O
given O
rise O
, O
including O
by O
- O
products O
such O
as O
tea O
pastries O
and O
similar O
light O
refreshments O
. O

But O
far O
more O
important O
, O
is O
to O
draw O
deeply O
on O
Pinglin B-GPE
's O
unique O
and O
refined O
qualities O
as O
a O
tea O
district O
and O
imbue O
the O
hearts O
and O
minds O
of O
local O
inhabitants O
and O
visitors O
alike O
with O
a O
deep O
appreciation O
of O
tea O
culture O
. O

With O
this O
in O
mind O
they O
are O
training O
local O
people O
to O
do O
voluntary O
cultural O
work O
, O
organizing O
activities O
associated O
with O
tea O
, O
producing O
and O
conserving O
local O
gazetteers O
and O
histories O
, O
all O
richly O
steeped O
in O
the O
style O
and O
romance O
of O
tea O
. O

Speaking O
of O
the O
assaults O
they O
face O
with O
the O
opening O
of O
the O
market O
, O
the O
township O
chief O
knits O
his O
brows O
tightly O
, O

" O
I O
hope O
the O
government O
can O
do O
something O
substantial O
to O
promote O
Taiwanese B-NORP
tea O
and O
draw O
up O
regulations O
for O
proper O
channels O
for O
marketing O
tea O
. O

Let O
everyone O
see O
how O
good O
it O
is O
to O
drink O
tea O
, O
and O
experience O
for O
themselves O
tea O
's O
benefits O
. O

This O
is O
the O
only O
way O
that O
tea O
will O
have O
a O
market O
; O
and O
then O
the O
younger O
generation O
will O
be O
willing O
to O
take O
over O
from O
us O
. O
" O

Hoping O
for O
fewer O
regulations O

In O
early O
times O
Pinglin B-GPE
was O
a O
key O
waystation O
on O
the B-FAC
Old I-FAC
Tan I-FAC
Lan I-FAC
Trail I-FAC
leading O
from O
Taipei B-GPE
to O
Ilan B-GPE
. O

These O
days O
the O
old O
road O
has O
been O
replaced O
by O
the B-FAC
Taipei I-FAC
- I-FAC
Ilan I-FAC
Highway I-FAC
. O

The O
current O
road O
brings O
a O
lot O
of O
visitors O
to O
Pinglin B-GPE
and O
has O
made O
transport O
of O
the O
tea O
produce O
much O
easier O
. O

It O
was O
originally O
thought O
that O
the B-FAC
Taipei I-FAC
- I-FAC
Ilan I-FAC
Expressway I-FAC
, O
due O
for O
completion O
in O
2003 B-DATE
, O
would O
also O
bring O
Pinglin B-GPE
new O
benefits O
, O
but O
the O
government O
is O
now O
planning O
to O
restrict O
the O
interchange O
to O
only O
large O
vehicles O
and O
locals O
from O
Pinglin B-GPE
. O

This O
is O
in O
order O
to O
protect O
the O
water O
catchment O
area O
. O

The O
township O
chief O
throws O
up O
his O
hands O
and O
comments O
with O
exasperation O
that O
in O
everything O
the O
government O
has O
done O
it O
has O
treated O
the O
local O
people O
officiously O
and O
shown O
no O
confidence O
in O
them O
. O

In O
his O
view O
, O
the O
government O
should O
think O
of O
some O
way O
whereby O
both O
Pinglin B-GPE
and O
the O
water O
resource O
protection O
zone O
can O
coexist O
and O
prosper O
. O

If O
they O
're O
afraid O
that O
the O
new O
expressway O
will O
bring O
hordes O
of O
people O
and O
pollute O
the O
water O
resources O
, O
then O
what O
they O
should O
do O
, O
within O
reasonable O
bounds O
, O
is O
allow O
the O
people O
here O
to O
build O
public O
facilities O
for O
visitors O
which O
will O
help O
minimise O
their O
impact O
on O
the O
local O
ecology O
, O
for O
example O
public O
toilets O
and O
comprehensive O
rubbish O
disposal O
. O

This O
would O
give O
people O
from O
outside O
the O
area O
more O
opportunity O
to O
appreciate O
Pinglin B-GPE
's O
idyllic O
natural O
setting O
. O

The O
local O
people O
have O
formed O
a O
fish O
conservation O
team O
and O
as O
a O
result O
the B-LOC
Peishih I-LOC
River I-LOC
is O
now O
protected O
. O

Many O
prized O
species O
of O
Taiwanese B-NORP
fish O
are O
being O
propagated O
. O

In O
the O
pristine O
forests O
are O
ancient O
pine O
forests O
with O
species O
unique O
to O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
and O
the O
deep O
blue O
skies O
attract O
waves O
of O
students O
to O
Pinglin B-GPE
to O
camp O
out O
and O
observe O
the O
stars O
. O

The O
calloused O
hands O
of O
the O

growers O
are O
steeped O
with O
the O
vitality O
of O
tea O
. O

The O

, O
next O
time O
you O
go O

about O

believes O

can O
develop O
the O
strength O
of O
the O
Taiwanese B-NORP
people O
. O

Below O
she O
describes O
her O
views O
. O

After O
the O
new O
government O
took O
office O
, O
apart O
from O
being O
briefed O
on O
our O
diplomatic O
partners O
and O
on O
countries O
with O
which O
we O
do O
n't O
have O
diplomatic O
relations O
, O
I O
also O
looked O
at O
civic O
organizations O
with O
which O
the O
MOFA B-ORG
has O
contacts O
and O
which O
are O
frequently O
active O
in O
the O
international O
community O
. O

I O
discovered O
that O
the B-ORG
World I-ORG
League I-ORG
for I-ORG
Freedom I-ORG
and I-ORG
Democracy I-ORG
is O
a O
well O
- O
run O
international O
organization O
with O
a O
complete O
organizational O
structure O
, O
is O
a O
member O
of O
the O
UN B-ORG
's O
Department B-ORG
of I-ORG
Public I-ORG
Information I-ORG
, O
and O
attends O
the B-EVENT
Annual I-EVENT
DPI I-EVENT
/ I-EVENT
NGO I-EVENT
Conference I-EVENT
every O
year O
. O

This B-DATE
year I-DATE
too O
it O
was O
planning O
to O
attend O
the O
millennium B-DATE
edition O
of O
the O
conference O
. O

Therefore O
when O
Professor O
Peng B-PERSON
invited O
me O
to O
attend O
, O
I O
agreed O
to O
join O
the O
delegation O
as O
an O
advisor O
to O
the O
league O
. O

The O
MOFA B-ORG
was O
very O
excited O
about O
my O
attending O
the O
conference O
, O
because O
we O
can O
say O
that O
this O
is O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
a O
MOFA B-ORG
official O
has O
entered O
the O
UN B-ORG
headquarters O
building O
in O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
30 I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

Everyone O
thought O
it O
was O
a O
great O
breakthrough O
. O

I O
also O
took O
the O
opportunity O
to O
personally O
get O
an O
understanding O
of O
how O
the B-EVENT
DPI I-EVENT
/ I-EVENT
NGO I-EVENT
Conference I-EVENT
works O
, O
and O
of O
the O
direction O
of O
mainstream O
international O
thinking O
, O
and O
I O
collected O
a O
lot O
of O
relevant O
information O
in O
the O
form O
of O
conference O
materials O
. O

Thus O
we O
gained O
a O
great O
deal O
from O
attending O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
main O
topics O
at O
this O
year B-DATE
's O
conference O
was O
the O
issue O
of O
how O
to O
go O
about O
monitoring O
how O
governments O
put O
into O
action O
their O
ideals O
and O
their O
promises O
to O
their O
peoples O
. O

Another O
main O
focus O
of O
discussion O
was O
the O
partnership O
between O
NGOs O
, O
national O
governments O
and O
the O
UN B-ORG
itself O
. O

These O
are O
all O
very O
important O
things O
for O
Taiwan B-GPE
to O
be O
thinking O
about O
, O
so O
we O
ought O
to O
participate O
more O
. O

The O
UN B-ORG
itself O
is O
an O
organization O
of O
national O
governments O
. O

At O
present O
we O
are O
excluded O
, O
and O
that O
is O
very O
difficult O
to O
change O
. O

NGOs O
represent O
a O
very O
good O
point O
of O
access O
. O

Today B-DATE
there O
are O
a O
tremendous O
number O
of O
NGOs O
. O

They O
hold O
frequent O
conferences O
, O
and O
they O
have O
an O
ever O
- O
growing O
influence O
on O
governments O
. O

For O
example O
, O
a B-DATE
couple I-DATE
of I-DATE
months I-DATE
ago I-DATE
I O
went O
to O
Warsaw B-GPE
to O
attend O
the B-EVENT
International I-EVENT
Forum I-EVENT
on I-EVENT
Democracy I-EVENT
. O

The O
forum O
was O
attended O
by O
foreign O
ministers O
from O
over B-CARDINAL
100 I-CARDINAL
countries O
, O
but O
it O
was O
also O
an O
NGO O

and O
so O

all O
high O

In O
other O
words O
, O
NGOs O
are O
very O
broad O
church O

Retired O
diplomats O
, O
business O
- O
people O
, O
social O
campaigners O
, O
academics O
and O
all O
kinds O
of O
foundations O
may O
be O
involved O
in O
NGOs O
. O

NGOs O
can O
be O
more O
powerful O
than O
governments O
, O
so O
governments O
certainly O
ca O
n O
t O
afford O
to O
ignore O
them O

At O
present O
, O
apart O
from O
the B-ORG
World I-ORG
League I-ORG
for I-ORG
Freedom I-ORG
and I-ORG
Democracy I-ORG
, O
a O
number O
of O
other O
NGOs O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
are O
associated O
with O
the O
UN B-ORG
, O
including O
women O
's O
, O
aboriginal O
and O
academic O
groups O
. O

We O
hope O
that O
in O
the O
future O
more O
groups O
will O
actively O
develop O
an O
international O
profile O
, O
and O
apply O
to O
register O
with O
the O
UN B-ORG
. O

Another O
way O
people O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
can O
actively O
participate O
in O
international O
affairs O
is O
by O
encouraging O
people O
of O
ability O
and O
influence O
in O
society O
to O
apply O
to O
join O
the O
UN B-ORG
's O
own O
NGOs O
, O
such O
as O
population O
, O
human O
rights O
, O
peace O
and O
environmental O
groups O
, O
so O
that O
they O
can O
contribute O
their O
knowledge O
, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
let O
others O
better O
understand O
people O
from O
Taiwan B-GPE
. O

We O
are O
living O
in O
an O
age O
of O
people O
power O
, O
and O
the O
UN B-ORG
is O
responding O
to O
the O
trends O
of O
our O
time O
. O

In O
the O
past O
, O
NGOs O
merely O
played O
a O
monitoring O
role O
at O
the O
UN B-ORG
, O
but O
now O
the O
trend O
is O
towards O
their O
involvement O
in O
policy O
implementation O
. O

Hence O
in O
our O
future O
approach O
to O
the O
UN B-ORG
, O
besides O
continuing O
to O
press O
for O
admission O
by O
mobilizing O
our O
diplomatic O
partners O
to O
speak O
on O
our O
behalf O
, O
we O
should O
also O
actively O
seek O
to O
make O
the O
most O
of O
the O
power O
of O
our O
people O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
in O
the O
age O
of O
the O
Internet O
, O
universal O
values O
such O
as O
humanitarianism O
and O
human O
rights O
transcend O
the O
narrow O
confines O
of O
national O
boundaries O
and O
nationalism O
. O

The O
Taiwan B-GPE
issue O
is O
one O
of O
basic O
human O
rights O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
the O
people O
of O
Taiwan B-GPE
are O
being O
denied O
the O
right O
to O
speak O
and O
vote O
in O
international O
affairs O
. O

We O
can O
use O
the O
Internet O
to O
gain O
the O
support O
of O
international O
champions O
of O
justice O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
among O
Taiwanese B-NORP
compatriots O
living O
overseas O
there O
are O
many O
who O
opposed O
the O
old O
government O
, O
but O
are O
willing O
to O
support O
the O
new O
. O

These O
people O
are O
excellent O
partners O
through O
whom O
we O
can O
participate O
in O
UN B-ORG
NGOs O
. O

We O
should O
n't O
be O
afraid O
of O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
communist O
regime O
's O
attempts O
to O
suppress O
such O
activity O

. O

They O
wo O
n't O
last O
forever O
, O
and O
they O
ca O
n't O
discourage O
everyone O
who O

Wu B-PERSON
has O
found O
that O
" O
modern O
men O
can O
in O

easily O

" O

Indeed O
, O
as O
consumers O
men O
are O
often O
easier O
to O
deal O
with O
than O
women O
, O
as O
they O
are O
more O

about O

When O
Taiwan B-GPE

a O
primarily O

then O
primarily O
industrial O

, O
most O

In O
the O
view O
of O
Betty B-PERSON
Wu I-PERSON
, O
the O
reason O
men O
are O
daring O
to O
enter O
the O
ranks O
of O
beauty O
lovers O
, O
and O
even O
accept O
softer O
and O
more O
feminine O
standards O
of O

, O
is O
because O
expectations O

men O

have O
changed O

The O

Generation B-NORP

their O

Thus O
they O
no O
longer O
are O
looking O
for O
someone O
who O
" O
walks O
and O
talks O
like O
a O
real O
man O
. O
" O

In O
the O
past O
, O
the O
definition O
of O
" O
a O
real O

was O
usually O
one O

Since O

do O
not O

what O

The O

In O
the B-DATE
1990s I-DATE
, O
the O
general O
trend O
of O
all O
cutting O

was O
" O
super-youth O

" O

Many O
well O

established O

the O

found O
it O
impossible O

the O

had O
to O
change O
their O

Looking O
around O
, O
you O
can O
see O
a O
transition O
in O
the O
most O

The O

say O
that O

just O

But O
as O
Wang B-PERSON

it O
, O
the O
deeper O
cause O
of O
the O
current O
worship O
of O
ever O
- O
greater O
youthfulness O
in O
modern O
society O
can O
be O
traced O
to O
the O
dissolution O
of O
the O
traditional O

Elders O

who O
held O
all O
the O

no O

to O
go O

Wang B-PERSON

" O
In O
a O

in O

" O

Besides O

Cross-gender O

sets O

pace O
for O

is O
often O
the O

pick O
up O

Many O
in O
that O
field O
are O
crossing O
traditional O
barriers O
between O
male O

In O
the O

only O

you O

this O

students O
in O
a O
single O
class O
. O

Some O
have O
been O
learning O
English B-LANGUAGE
since O
very O
young O
and O
find O
class O
too O
easy O
, O
and O
so O
when O
the O
lesson O
starts O
their O
enthusiasm O
evaporates O
. O

For O
other O
students O
meeting O
English B-LANGUAGE
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
, O
however O
, O
the O
lessons O
are O
hard O
going O
. O

Added O
to O
this O
is O
the O
perennial O
problem O
of O
class O
sizes O
being O
too O
large O
, O
and O
not O
enough O
English B-LANGUAGE
classes O
scheduled O
- O
only O
one B-CARDINAL
or O
two B-CARDINAL
a O

. O

It O
's O
extremely O
difficult O
to O
correct O
pronunciation O
problems O
, O
or O
to O
achieve O
any O
educational O
goals O
at O
all O
, O
under O
these O
conditions O
. O

The O
parents O
have O
a O
number O
of O
concerns O
. O

If O
the O
teachers O
only O
speak O
English B-LANGUAGE
in O
class O
it O
will O
frighten O
children O
who O
have O
never O
learnt O
English B-LANGUAGE
before O
. O

Some O
teachers O
teach O
too O
quickly O
and O
some O
of O
their O
students O
ca O
n't O
keep O
up O
, O
so O
all O
parents O
can O
do O
is O
send O
their O
kids O
to O
private O
language O
schools O
. O

Singing O
and O
jumping O
around O
are O
not O
really O
suitable O
for O
the O
senior O
grades O
, O
and O
parents O
hope O
that O
teachers O
will O
keep O
in O
mind O
the O
different O
needs O
of O
different O
age O
groups O
. O

Parents O
and O
teachers O
both O
raised O
the O
idea O
of O
" O
ability O
streaming O
, O
" O
i.e. O
, O
different O
classes O
for O
different O
ability O
levels O
, O
to O
address O
the O
difficulties O
of O
large O

. O

Educators O
, O
however O
, O
have O
many O
reservations O

explains O
, O
" O
Every O
Chinese B-NORP
family O
is O
preoccupied O
with O
being O
able O
to O
get O
ahead O
in O
the O
world O
, O
but O
our O
past O
experience O
with O
ability O
- O
based O
class O
groupings O
has O
taught O
us O
some O
bitter O
lessons O
. O
" O

When O
students O
are O
grouped O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
ability O
, O
some O
parents O
get O
upset O
when O
their O
children O
are O
placed O
in O
a O
lower O
level O
group O
, O
which O
makes O
them O
lose O
face O
. O

It O
can O
also O
affect O
the O
children O
's O
confidence O
. O

" O
We O
have O
large O
numbers O
of O
students O
. O

People O
need O
to O
think O
about O
what O
resources O
the O
schools O
have O
, O
and O
whether O
they O
could O
help O
in O
some O
way O
. O
" O

She O
suggests O
that O
schools O
can O
organize O
English B-LANGUAGE
Clubs O
for O
the O
more O
advanced O
students O
, O
and O
their O
teachers O
can O
provide O
them O
with O
interesting O
story O
books O
which O
are O
more O
demanding O
. O

This O
way O
, O
they O
'll O
feel O
that O
the O
teacher O
is O
giving O
them O
some O
attention O
, O
and O
that O
their O
needs O
are O
also O
being O
catered O
for O
. O

" O
Private O
language O
schools O
fill O
a O
need O
for O
small O
- O
group O
learning O
. O
" O

Professor O
Chang B-PERSON
Hsien I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
ta I-PERSON
recommends O
that O
teachers O
use O
" O
co-operative O
learning O
" O
methods O
. O

For O
example O
, O
divide O
a O
large O
class O
into O
groups O
to O
discuss O
what O
they O
would O
buy O
with O
NT$ B-MONEY
100 I-MONEY
. O

The O
more O
advanced O
students O
can O
lead O
the O
discussion O
, O
which O
gives O
them O
a O
sense O
of O
participation O
. O

But O
this O
kind O
of O
activity O
may O
not O
succeed O
the O
first O
few O
times O
- O
it O
takes O
time O
to O
get O
used O
to O
group O
learning O
. O

With O
regard O
to O
the O
problems O
of O
having O
too O
few O
classes O
a O
week O
and O
learning O
very O
little O
English B-LANGUAGE
, O
the O
working O
group O
suggested O
that O
schools O
could O
take O
advantage O
of O
times O
such O
as O
early O
- O
morning O
study O
hour O
, O
cleaning O
time O
, O
and O
the O
lunch O
break O
to O
play O
tapes O
or O
practise O
speaking O
English B-LANGUAGE
, O
to O
give O
students O
more O
exposure O
to O
English B-LANGUAGE
. O

Fewer O
foreign O
teachers O

In O
the O
past O
, O
English B-LANGUAGE
teaching O
placed O
too O
much O
emphasis O
on O
reading O
and O
writing O
, O
whereas O
now O
for O
most O
primary O
school O
students O
, O
" O
learning O
to O
understand O
and O
speak O
is O
foremost O
, O
reading O
and O
writing O
is O
secondary O
. O
" O

Nevertheless O
many O
people O
have O
reservations O
about O
the O
pronunciation O
of O
the O
English B-LANGUAGE
teachers O
in O
our O
primary O
schools O
. O

Private O
language O
schools O
also O
seem O
aware O
of O
this O
, O
and O
many O
prominently O
advertise O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
employ O
foreign O
teachers O
. O

But O
do O
the O
foreign O
teachers O
really O
teach O
more O
effectively O
than O
our O
local O
teachers O
? O

" O
Many O
people O
put O
the O
root O
of O
the O
problems O
they O
had O
learning O
English B-LANGUAGE
down O
to O
not O
being O
able O
to O

Hsu B-PERSON

it O
was O
that O
the O
gravity O

of O

As O
Hsia B-PERSON
recalls O
, O
the O
main O
incentive O
for O
studying O
under O
Li B-PERSON
Chung I-PERSON

sheng I-PERSON
was O
that O
Li B-PERSON

fees O
were O
relatively O
affordable O

Other O

charged O
upwards O

45 B-MONEY

at O

reaching O
60 B-MONEY

70 I-MONEY

No O

getting O
by O
on O
a O
military O
allowance O
of O
just O
25 B-MONEY

per O

The O
only O
choice O
was O
the B-FAC

where O
the O
monthly O

was O
just O
20 B-MONEY

Rescuing O

As O
Hsia B-PERSON
recalls O
, O
the O
only O

materials O

were O
red O

black O

courtesy O
of O
the O

. O

Sometimes O
they O
mixed O
the O
ink O
with O
glue O
to O
produce O
an O
oil O

. O

Scraping O
together O
the O
money O
for O
just O
one B-CARDINAL
tube O
of O
oil O
paint O
involved O
considerable O
effort O

and O
Hsia B-PERSON
remembers O
repeatedly O
uncapping O
that O
single O
tube O
to O
breathe O
in O
the O
lovely O
scent O
of O

. O

The O
painters O
took O
turns O
taking O
off O
their O
shirts O
to O
model O
for O
each O
other O
, O
and O
Hsia B-PERSON
would O
sometimes O
spend O
the B-DATE

sketching O

the O

The O
declaration O

which O
Hsia B-PERSON

shows O
that O
the O

objective O
was O
to O
modernize O

by O
drawing O
Western B-NORP
artistic O

on O
people O
's O
houses O
and O
restoring O
furniture O
. O

Times O
were O
tough O
, O
but O
it O
was O
during O
this O
period O
that O
he O
found O
what O
he O
had O
been O
probing O
for O
in O
his O
use O
of O
line O
, O
and O
started O
on O
the O
" O
fuzzy O
people O
" O
phase O
of O
his O
output O
. O

Hsia B-PERSON
's O
fuzzy O
people O
were O
born O
into O
his O
work O
as O
if O
by O
a O
natural O
process O
. O

While O
experimenting O
with O
a O
tangle O
of O
lines O
Hsia B-PERSON
found O
unidentifiable O
clusters O
taking O
shape O
, O
from O
which O
human O
forms O
began O
to O
emerge O
. O

" O
This O
was O
something O
I O
really O
knew O
I O
could O
work O
with O
, O
" O
recalls O
Hsia B-PERSON
. O

It O
was O
a O
case O
of O
" O
seizing O
that O
special O
thing O
of O
your O
own O
, O
" O
which O
for O
an O
artist O
is O
of O
the O
utmost O
importance O
. O

Like O
a O
Taoist B-NORP
priest O
painting O
magic O
symbols O
, O
Hsia B-PERSON
uses O
line O
to O
create O
human O
figures O
and O
the O
written O
word O
to O
invoke O
power O
. O

With O
rapid O
, O
sweeping O
strokes O
of O
the O
brush O
he O
creates O
fluid O
, O
free O
- O
floating O
figures O
, O
without O
faces O
or O
personalities O
, O
performing O
their O
allotted O
roles O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
a O
coldly O
linear O
realm O
. O

The O
resulting O
images O
reflect O
the O
alienation O
of O
modern O
life O
, O
conveying O
a O
sense O
of O
illusion O
and O
impermanence O
. O

It O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
Hsia B-PERSON
Yang I-PERSON
himself O
, O
the O
lifelong O
drifter O
, O
is O
the O
prototype O
for O
these O
blurry O
beings O
. O

But O
then O
again O
, O
which O
of O
us O
is O
not O
in O
transit O
, O
drifting O
through O
this O
brief O
existence O
? O

" O
As O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
say O
, O
man O
is O
a O
passenger O
through O
life O
who O
is O
gone O
in O
an O
instant O
. O

Hsia B-PERSON
Yang I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
fuzzy O
people O
exist O
very O
much O
within O
this O
Eastern B-NORP
philosophical O
context O
. O
" O

So O
says O
Fu B-PERSON
Shen I-PERSON
, O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
judges O
in O
the O
fine O
arts O
category O
for O
the O
2000 B-DATE
National B-ORG

awards O
. O

While O
he O
was O
in O
France B-GPE
Hsia B-PERSON
received O
a O
letter O
from O
a O
friend O
in O
the O
US B-GPE
saying O
: O
" O
Life O
is O
easier O
here O
. O
" O

Soon O
afterwards O
he O
moved O
to O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
, O
renting O
a O
cheap O
loft O
in O
SoHo B-LOC
and O
supporting O
himself O
as O
a O
furniture O
restorer O
. O

Photorealism O
was O
the O
vogue O
in O
American B-NORP
painting O
at O
the O
time O
. O

It O
did O
n't O
appeal O
to O
Hsia B-PERSON
at O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
but O
he O
knew O
he O
had O
to O
learn O
something O
in O
his O
new O
country O
of O
residence O
, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
he O
needed O
to O
produce O
work O
that O
was O
commercially O
viable O
. O

He O
began O
employing O
photographic O
effects O
, O
for O
example O
depicting O
a O
crowd O
of O
passersby O
on O
a O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
street O
as O
a O
speeding O
blur O
. O

His O
work O
now O
became O
populated O
with O
" O
floating O
people O
" O
of O
this O
kind O
, O
although O
in O
spirit O
they O
were O
still O
the O
fuzzy O
people O
of O
his O
earlier O
period O
. O

Hsia B-PERSON
spent O
over O
20 B-DATE
years I-DATE
in O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
, O
painting O
in O
the O
cavernous O
gloom O
of O
his O
loft O
, O
eating O
Chinese B-NORP
food O
and O
listening O
to O
traditional O
Chinese B-NORP
opera O
music O
. O

The O
walls O
of O
the O
loft O
were O
pasted O
with O
simple O
verses O
, O
written O
by O
Hsia B-PERSON
in O
language O
that O
was O
part O
literary O
Chinese B-NORP
and O
part O
colloquial O
. O

" O
I O
was O
like O
a O
Chinese B-NORP
person O
dwelling O
in O
a O
Chinese B-NORP
concession O
in O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
, O
" O
says O
Hsia B-PERSON
with O
a O
laugh O
. O

The O
biggest O
boon O
of O
living O
in O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
was O
that O
this O
was O
where O
Hsia B-PERSON
met O
his O
wife O
Wu B-PERSON
Shuang I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
hsi I-PERSON
. O

Wu B-PERSON
had O
grown O
up O
in O
a O
contented O
home O
never O
knowing O
poverty O
, O
and O
held O
a O
PhD B-WORK_OF_ART
in O
philosophy O
. O

She O
met O
Hsia B-PERSON
through O
the O
painter O
Hsieh B-PERSON
Li I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
fa I-PERSON
, O
and O
since O
then O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
have O
shared O
a O
simple O
and O
quiet O
life O
together O
. O

" O
Feeling O
anxious O
when O
the O
old O
lady O
's O
not O
here O
, O
and O
looking O
listlessly O
out O
the O
window O
/ O
So O
bored O
of O
this O
dumb O
view O
, O
it O
's O
much O
better O
when O
the O
silly O
little O
thing O
's O
around O
. O
" O

So O
runs O
one O
of O
Hsia B-PERSON
's O
light O
- O
hearted O
couplets O
, O
testifying O
to O
the O
affection O
that O
unites O
these O
two B-CARDINAL
people O
who O
only O
came O
together O
relatively O
late O
in O
life O
. O

Going O
home O

Hsia B-PERSON
returned O
to O
Taiwan B-GPE
in O
1992 B-DATE
, O
after O
three B-DATE
decades I-DATE
away O
. O

With O
a O
basic O
source O
of O
income O
guaranteed O
through O
an O
art O

, O
Hsia B-PERSON
rented O
a O
spacious O
, O
light O
- O
filled O
three B-CARDINAL

story O
house O
in O
Peitou B-GPE
. O

The O
new O

was O
ideal O
for O
painting O
, O
but O
at O
NT$ B-MONEY
35,000 I-MONEY
per O
month O
the O
rent O
was O
on O
the O
high O
side O
. O

Hsia B-PERSON
's O
" O
silly O
little O
" O
wife O
was O
in O
tears O
when O
it O
came O
to O
signing O
the O
lease O
, O
worrying O
that O
eventually O
they O
would O
n't O
be O
able O

for O
the B-DATE

after O
their O
return O

Taiwan B-GPE
, O
and O
Hsia B-PERSON
and O
his O
wife O
were O
thus O
able O
to O
settle O
themselves O
down O
. O

" O
At O
key O
moments O
, O
a O
little O
help O
from O
your O
friends O
can O
make O
all O
the O
difference O
, O
" O
says O
Hsia B-PERSON
. O

Financial O
help O
from O
his O
friends O
at O
such O
moments O
was O
what O
enabled O
Hsia B-PERSON
to O
go O
abroad O
in O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
place O
and O
then O
, O
eventually O
, O
to O
return O
again O
to O
Taiwan B-GPE
. O

This O
is O
something O
that O
the O
reserved O
Hsia B-PERSON
has O
frequent O
cause O
to O
think O
about O
. O

After O
returning O
to O
Taiwan B-GPE
Hsia B-PERSON
Yang I-PERSON
reverted O
to O
painting O
fuzzy O

. O

Over O
the B-DATE

, O
Hsia B-PERSON

have O
taken O
on O
a O

be O
it O
as O

, O
couples O

They O
have O
mimicked O

such O

now O
the O

well O

known O

from O
the O
Chinese B-NORP

part O
of O
a O
series O
of O
works O
that O
examines O
the O
role O
of O

in O
people O

For O
Hsia B-PERSON
Yang I-PERSON
, O
all O
characters O
are O
fair O
game O
for O
inclusion O
in O
his O
work O
, O
and O
all O

them O
end O
up O

Why O

into O

" O
and O
has O
he O
ever O
thought O

The O

out O
that O
he O

predict O

says O
that O
if O

it O
will O
be O
through O
a O
natural O
process O
, O
like O
the O

when O
the O

By O
cutting O

twisting O

A B-DATE
few I-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
when O
New B-GPE

was O
newly O
opened O
up O
to O
immigration O
and O
there O
were O
n't O
many O
Chinese B-NORP
around O
, O
hardly O
anyone O
had O
heard O
of O
the B-ORG

Hsia I-ORG
Association I-ORG
, O
and O
inviting O
government O
officials O
to O
attend O
such O
events O
was O
always O
fraught O
with O
difficulty O
. O

As O
more O
and O
more O
Asian B-NORP
immigrants O
arrived O
, O
members O
of O
Parliament B-ORG
- O
vying O
for O
votes O
- O
began O
participating O
enthusiastically O
in O
the O
Association B-ORG
's O
events O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
the O
Association B-ORG
has O
supported O
charitable O
causes O
in O
New B-GPE
Zealand I-GPE
for O
many B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
donating O
time O
and O
money O
, O
has O
been O
especially O
important O
in O
terms O
of O
getting O
taken O
seriously O
by O
the O
government O
, O
and O
it O
is O
thanks O
to O
the O
efforts O
of O
immigrants O
from O
Taiwan B-GPE
that O
successes O
like O
the O
New B-EVENT
Year I-EVENT
celebration O
have O
become O
possible O
. O

For O
our O
family O
, O
it O
was O
our B-DATE
tenth I-DATE
year I-DATE
in O
New B-GPE
Zealand I-GPE
since O
arriving O
as O
immigrants O
. O

Our O
daughter O
had O
just O
turned O
ten B-DATE
and O
our O
son O
was O
starting O
primary O
school O
when O
we O
came O
here O
. O

During O
the O
tough O
years O
as O
new O
immigrants O
we O
overcame O
numerous O
difficulties O
of O
language O
and O
culture O
, O
working O
to O
establish O
ourselves O
in O
this O
foreign O
land O
. O

We O
wanted O
our O
children O
to O
quickly O
adapt O
to O
the O
Western B-NORP
world O
but O
without O
forgetting O
their O
Chinese B-NORP
roots O
, O
so O
we O
endlessly O
reminded O
them O
that O
we O
will O
always O
be O
" O
descendants O
of O
the B-PERSON
Yellow I-PERSON
Emperor I-PERSON
, O
" O
and O
urged O
them O
to O
merge O
into O
Western B-NORP
society O
with O
the O
characteristic O
tenacity O
and O
humanity O
of O
Chinese B-NORP
people O
. O

When O
the O
UAA B-ORG
was O
first B-ORDINAL
set O
up O
in O
1995 B-DATE
, O
Sharon B-PERSON
came O
to O
our O
house O
in O
need O
of O
assistance O
from O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
community O
, O
filled O
with O
enthusiasm O
but O
uncertain O
about O
how O
to O
make O
contact O
with O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
. O

Our O
daughter O
has O
been O
Sharon B-PERSON
's O
pal O
ever O
since O
, O
and O
it O
was O
she O
who O
suggested O
that O
Sharon B-PERSON
see O
R.C. B-PERSON
Shih I-PERSON
about O
a O
co-sponsor O
for O
this O
year B-DATE
's O
New B-EVENT
Year I-EVENT
celebration O
. O

Several B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
before O
the O
event O
Sharon B-PERSON
asked O
me O
if O
I O
wanted O
to O
design O
a O
special O
garland O
to O
welcome O
the O
prime O
minister O
. O

As O
a O
Howick B-GPE
resident O
and O
a O
floral O
designer O
, O
how O
could O
I O
refuse O
? O

I O
used O
scarlet O
silk O
cord O
and O
miniature O
embroidered O
Chinese B-NORP
slippers O
-LRB- O
as O
used O
in O
Chinese B-NORP
knotting O
-RRB- O
along O
with O
dried O
flowers O
, O
to O
make O
a O
red O
and O
gold O
garland O
. O

As O
I O
put O
it O
on O
the O
premier O
I O
explained O
that O
these O
were O
lucky O
colors O
used O
for O
Chinese B-EVENT
New I-EVENT
Year I-EVENT
. O

She O
was O
delighted O
with O
this O
beautiful O
souvenir O
, O
rich O
in O
Chinese B-NORP
culture O
and O
art O
, O
and O
said O
she O
would O
keep O
it O
forever O
. O

With O
the O
steady O
introduction O
of O
Chinese B-NORP
culture O
into O
this O
country O
, O
New B-NORP
Zealanders I-NORP
are O
generally O
more O
aware O
of O
Taiwan B-GPE
than O
before O
, O
and O
immigrants O
from O
Taiwan B-GPE
have O
been O
working O
hard O
to O
soften O
the O
anti-Asian B-NORP
sentiments O
of O
the O
locals O
. O

When O
the O
program O
of O
New B-EVENT
Year I-EVENT
performances O
wrapped O
up O
, O
many O
New B-GPE
Zealand I-GPE
friends O
came O
forward O
to O
express O
their O
thanks O
, O
saying O
that O
they O
now O
felt O
more O
familiar O
with O
China B-GPE

were O

Sweating O
in O
the O
Spotlight O

Recently O
the O
Taipei B-GPE
City I-GPE
Department B-ORG
of I-ORG
Urban I-ORG
Development I-ORG
announced O
their O
idea O
for O
a B-WORK_OF_ART
" I-WORK_OF_ART
Taipei I-WORK_OF_ART
Citizen I-WORK_OF_ART
's I-WORK_OF_ART
Passport I-WORK_OF_ART
. O
" O

Who O
is O
their O
idea O
of O
a O
typical O
Taipei B-GPE
Citizen O
? O

The O
answer O
is O
an O
environmentally O
conscious O
, O
culture O
- O
loving O
person O
who O
has O
a O
soft O
spot O
in O
their O
heart O
for O
good O
causes O
- O
someone O
who O
reads O
several O
books O
a O
month O
, O
recycles O
, O
takes O
mass O
transit O
, O
donates O
blood O
, O
does O
volunteer O
work O
, O
plants O
flowers O
on O
their O
balcony O
and O
cleans O
their O
building O
's O
exterior O
walls O
. O

That O
's O
who O
! O

This O
" O
passport O
, O
" O
with O
its O
middle O
- O
class O
and O
decidedly O
Western B-LOC
sensibility O
, O
is O
just O
one B-CARDINAL
example O
of O
how O
Taipei B-GPE
differs O
from O
other O
places O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
. O

Not O
long O
after O
Chen B-PERSON
Shui I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
bian I-PERSON
ascended O
to O
the O
ROC B-GPE
presidency O
, O
the B-ORG
Office I-ORG
of I-ORG
the I-ORG
President I-ORG
began O
to O
come O
into O
sharp O
conflict O
with O
Taipei B-FAC
City I-FAC
Hall I-FAC
. O

They O
clashed O
over O
whether O
to O
build O
a O
domed O
stadium O
, O
over O
how O
to O
allocate O
government O
funds O
, O
over O
which O
romanization O
system O
should O
be O
employed O
to O
transcribe O
Chinese B-NORP
characters O
, O
and O
even O
over O
whether O
the O
mayor O
was O
showing O
the O
president O
proper O
respect O
. O

These O
conflicts O
have O
caused O
Taipei B-GPE
City I-GPE
to O
become O
isolated O
from O
Taiwan B-GPE
's O
other O
cities O
and O
counties O
. O

What O
exactly O
is O
at O
the O
heart O
of O
these O
disputes O
? O

Is O
there O
a O
north O
- O
south O
divide O
between O
Taipei B-GPE
and O
the O
other O
counties O
and O
cities O
? O

And O
are O
the O
calls O
of O
" O
Taipei B-GPE
first B-ORDINAL
" O
and O
of O
" O
Taiwan B-GPE
first B-ORDINAL
" O
mutually O
reinforcing O
or O
mutually O
exclusive O
? O

Taipei B-GPE
's O
wealth O
and O
high O
status O
as O
the O
capital O
have O
long O
been O
a O
sore O
spot O
with O
many O
people O
living O
elsewhere O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
. O

Some O
argue O
that O
Taiwan B-GPE
ought O
to O
be O
divided O
into O
four B-CARDINAL
counties O
by O
the B-LOC
Chuoshui I-LOC
River I-LOC
and O
the B-LOC
Central I-LOC
Mountain I-LOC
Range I-LOC
, O
with O
financial O
resources O
being O
equitably O
divided O
to O
create O
uniform O
levels O
of O
development O
in O
each O
. O

Others O
question O
whether O
the O
central O
government O
should O
be O
located O
at O
the O
northern O
tip O
of O
the O
island O
, O
making O
it O
difficult O
to O
reach O
for O
civil O
servants O
and O
regular O
citizens O
alike O
. O

Why O
not O
instead O
move O
the O
capital O
to O
Taichung B-GPE
, O
they O
suggest O
. O

Since O
the O
Taiwan B-GPE
provincial O
government O
was O
largely O
disbanded O
two B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
the O
21 B-CARDINAL
counties O
and O
cities O
of O
Taiwan B-GPE
have O
been O
directly O
under O
the O
ROC B-GPE
central O
government O
. O

With O
the O
election O
of O
Chen B-PERSON
Shui I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
bian I-PERSON
, O
the O
ROC B-GPE
is O
now O
under O
the O
control O
of O
the B-ORG
Democratic I-ORG
Progressive I-ORG
Party I-ORG
-LRB- O
DPP B-ORG
-RRB- O
, O
as O
are O
many O
of O
Taiwan B-GPE

other O
cities O
and O
counties O
, O
including O
Kaohsiung B-GPE
, O
which O
like O
Taipei B-GPE
enjoys O
special O
status O
as O
a O
" O
self O

" O

Whereas O
the O
south O
was O
Chen B-PERSON

principal O
source O
of O
votes O
, O
the O
blue O
of O
the O
KMT B-ORG
holds O
sway O
in O
Taipei B-GPE
, O
making O
the O
city O
a O
thorn O
in O
the O
side O
of O
the O
ruling O
DPP B-ORG
and O
threatening O
its O
privileged O
position O
. O

In O
July B-DATE
the O
city O
and O
the O
central O
government O
quarreled O
over O
how O
much O
money O
the O
city O
would O
be O
allotted O
in O
the O
national O
budget O
, O
and O
the O
city O

was O
cut O
by O
NT$ B-MONEY
6 I-MONEY

Then O
in O
October B-DATE
the B-ORG
Executive I-ORG

lowered O
the O
population O

for O
self O

joined O
Taipei B-GPE

as O
a O
special O

. O

Various O
other O
large O
cities O

counties O
also O
hope O
to O
achieve O
this O
so O
as O
to O
enjoy O
the O
same O
status O
as O
Taipei B-GPE
. O

The O
goose O
that O
lays O
the O
golden O
eggs O

Is O
Taipei B-GPE
really O
specially O
blessed O
? O

Why O
is O
it O
the O
focus O
of O
so O
much O
attention O
, O
of O
so O
much O
envy O
and O
jealousy O
? O

Perhaps O
the O
following O
figures O
can O
help O
shed O
some O
light O
on O
this O
matter O
: O

The B-LOC
Taipei I-LOC

holds O
12 B-PERCENT

whether O

the O

an O

Tseng B-PERSON

who O
strongly O

the O
place O
where O
he O
grew O
up O
, O
goes O
back O
every O

visit O
his O
parents O

In O
his O
hometown O
there O
are O
20,000 B-CARDINAL
people O

and O
only O
two B-CARDINAL
elementary O
schools O

one B-CARDINAL
junior O
high O

There O
, O
if O
a O
neighbor O

n't O
a O

, O
he O
's O
probably O
an O
old O

You O
really O
get O
a O

his O

has O
seen O
a O
syndrome O
play O
out O
there O

people O

die O

then O
they O
sell O
their O

family O
home O
go O
to O
ruin O
, O
pull O
up O
their O
stakes O

move O
to O
Taipei B-GPE

Because O

When O
my O
wife O
's O
company O
sent O
her O
to O
Paris B-GPE
to O
work O
, O
we O
did O
n't O
think O
that O
our O
daughter O
, O
then O
just O
over O
a O
year B-DATE
old O
, O
would O
have O
any O
problems O
with O
attending O
school O
there O
. O

Little O
did O
we O
imagine O
a O
colleague O
would O
inform O
us O
that O
her O
daughter O
had O
been O
" O
surrounded O
and O
attacked O
" O
by O
a O
group O
of O
young O
French B-NORP
children O
on O
her B-DATE
first I-DATE
day I-DATE
of O
pre-school O
. O

The O
incident O
frightened O
her O
so O
badly O
that O
she O
would O
n't O
let O
her O
daughter O
go O
back O
to O
school O
. O

If O
that O
was O
the O
case O
, O
my O
wife O
and O
I O
had O
a O
serious O
problem O
on O
our O
hands O
. O

What O
could O
we O
do O
with O
Chien B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chien I-PERSON
if O
she O
was O
going O
to O
be O
viewed O
as O
a O
" O
little O
foreigner O
" O
and O
be O
bullied O
at O
school O
every O
day O
? O

The O
only O
solution O
seemed O
to O
be O
to O
have O
her O
learn O
French B-LANGUAGE
. O

That O
way O
, O
if O
we O
ended O
up O
in O
court O
, O
at O
least O
she O
would O
n't O
have O
to O
stand O
there O
mute O
. O

And O
so O
we O
hired O
Martine B-PERSON
, O
a O
Frenchwoman B-NORP
in O
her O
50s B-DATE
, O
to O
be O
Chien B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chien I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
nanny O
. O

My O
wife O
truly O
treasures O
Chien B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chien I-PERSON
, O
and O
was O
not O
at O
all O
comfortable O
with O
the O
idea O
of O
leaving O
her O
with O
someone O
else O
. O

First B-ORDINAL
, O
we O
had O
no O
idea O
what O
kind O
of O
person O
Martine B-PERSON
was O
. O

We O
knew O
only O
that O
she O
was O
a O
licensed O
nanny O
with O
documents O
from O
the O
French B-NORP
government O
, O
and O
hiring O
her O
to O
look O
after O
Chien B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chien I-PERSON
seemed O
better O
than O
hiring O
a O
cheaper O
unlicensed O
nanny O
. O

Second B-ORDINAL
, O
Chien B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chien I-PERSON
understood O
no O
French B-LANGUAGE
, O
so O
we O
were O
concerned O
that O
she O
might O
be O
mistreated O
. O

We O
could O
n't O
have O
guessed O
that O
Martine B-PERSON
would O
treasure O
her O
just O
as O
much O
as O
my O
wife O
does O
. O

And O
Martine B-PERSON
knew O
how O
to O
handle O
children O
! O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
thank O
Heaven O
for O
her O
. O

I O
remember O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
day O
we O
took O
Chien B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chien I-PERSON
to O
Martine B-PERSON
's O
place O
. O

My O
wife O
and O
Chien B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chien I-PERSON
played O
out O
an O
extended O
farewell O
scene O
before O
finally O
tearfully O
parting O
. O

And O
her O
father O
? O

Although O
I O
understood O
no O
French B-LANGUAGE
in O
those O
days O
, O
I O
was O
prepared O
to O
spend O
the O
whole O
day O
with O
Chien B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chien I-PERSON
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
convey O
to O
Martine B-PERSON
the O
idea O
that O
" O
if O
you O
beat O
the O
dog O
, O
you O
'd O
better O
be O
prepared O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
master O
. O
" O

But O
in O
spite O
of O
my O
resolution O
, O
within O
ten B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
, O
with O
Martine B-PERSON
gesturing O
and O
Chien B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chien I-PERSON
sobbing O
, O
I O
was O
hustled O
out O
the O
door O
. O

At O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
I O
thought O
I O
had O
better O
stand O
outside O
and O
" O
keep O
an O
eye O
on O
things O
, O
" O
but O
then O
I O
realized O
that O
that O
would O
n't O
accomplish O
anything O
, O
and O
I O
made O
my O
dejected O
way O
home O
. O

Later O
Martine B-PERSON
told O
my O
wife O
that O
I O
had O
had O
to O
leave O
unless O
I O
wanted O
to O
spend O
my O
entire O
life O
holding O
Chien B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chien I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
hand O
. O

It O
took O
Martine B-PERSON
to O
remind O
us O
that O
short O
, O
sharp O
pains O
are O
better O
than O
long O
, O
drawn O
- O
out O
suffering O
. O

At O
the O
outset O
, O
we O
were O
concerned O
that O
Chien B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chien I-PERSON
would O
n't O
like O
French B-NORP
food O
, O
so O
we O
prepared O
a O
lunchbox O
for O
her O
everyday O
and O
delivered O
it O
with O
her O
to O
Martine B-PERSON
. O

But O
every O
evening O
, O
her O
lunchbox O
came O
back O
untouched O
. O

Was O
n't O
she O
eating O
? O

Thinking O
, O
" O
If O
this O
continues O
, O
she O
'll O
starve O
to O
death O
, O
" O
we O
confronted O
Martine B-PERSON
. O

Confronted O
, O
Martine B-PERSON
calmly O
informed O
us O
that O
Chien B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chien I-PERSON
could O
n't O
spend O
her O
entire O
time O
in O
France B-GPE
eating O
the O
lunchboxes O
we O
prepared O
. O

And O
, O
she O
continued O
, O
since O
that O
was O
the O
case O
, O
why O
not O
get O
Chien B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chien I-PERSON
used O
to O
eating O
French B-NORP
food O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
? O

Furthermore O
, O
she O
informed O
us O
that O
her O
own O
nutritious O
homemade O
meals O
would O
help O
Chien B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chien I-PERSON
grow O
. O

She O
was O
even O
planning O
to O
prepare O
a O
" O
dinner O
box O
" O
for O
Chien B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chien I-PERSON
to O
bring O
home O
in O
the O
evenings O
. O

Our O
" O
confrontation O
" O
turned O
into O
an O
abject O
apology O
! O

One B-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
Martine B-PERSON
mentioned O
to O
us O
that O
Chien B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chien I-PERSON
was O
a O
little O
cross-eyed O
. O

However O
, O
she O
said O
we O
were O
not O
to O
worry O
because O
children O
's O
eyes O
usually O
correct O
themselves O
as O
they O
get O
older O
. O

To O
ease O
our O
minds O
, O
she O
had O
already O
taken O
Chien B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chien I-PERSON
to O
see O
her O
uncle O
, O
an O
ophthalmologist O
. O

If O
Chien B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chien I-PERSON
would O
visit O
him O
again O
four B-CARDINAL
or I-CARDINAL
five I-CARDINAL
times O
at O
two B-DATE
- I-DATE
week I-DATE
intervals O
, O
everything O
would O
be O
fine O
. O

When O
we O
asked O
her O
about O
the O
fee O
, O
she O
would O
only O
say O
that O
it O
should O
n't O
be O
much O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
she O
never O
did O
tell O
us O
. O

Usually O
, O
nannies O
view O
sick O
children O
as O
an O
annoyance O
because O
they O
require O
more O
care O
, O
and O
often O
must O
be O
given O
medication O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
most O
nannies O
expect O
that O
a O
child O
's O
family O
will O
take O
care O
of O
it O
when O
it O
is O
sick O
. O

But O
Martine B-PERSON
was O
different O
. O

When O
the O
weather O
turned O
cool O
and O
Chien B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chien I-PERSON
came O
down O
with O
a O
fever O
, O
Martine B-PERSON
called O
my O
wife O
to O
offer O
to O
keep O
Chien B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chien I-PERSON
for O
the O
night O
. O

She O
told O
my O
wife O
that O
she O
had O
been O
a O
nurse O
and O
that O
taking O
Chien B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chien I-PERSON
home O
in O
the O
cold O
night O
air O
might O
worsen O
her O
chill O
. O

My O
wife O
, O
who O
had O
been O
hoping O
to O
take O
care O
of O
our O
sick O
daughter O
herself O
when O
she O
got O
home O
from O
work O
, O
naturally O
declined O
her O
kind O
offer O
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
we O
became O
more O
and O
more O
comfortable O
-LRB- O
and O
more O
and O
more O
grateful O
-RRB- O
having O
Martine B-PERSON
as O
Chien B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chien I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
nanny O
. O

I O
think O
Martine B-PERSON
treated O
Chien B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chien I-PERSON
just O
as O
if O
she O
were O
her O
own O
child O
. O

Our O
daughter O
is O
now O
three B-DATE
years I-DATE
old O
and O
attends O
a O
pre-school O
near O
our O
home O
. O

Chien B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chien I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
teacher O
has O
told O
my O
wife O
that O
Chien B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chien I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
French B-LANGUAGE
is O
very O
good O
. O

Perhaps O
because O
our O
little O
" O
foreigner O
" O
now O
speaks O
French B-LANGUAGE
, O
she O
gets O
along O
very O
well O
with O
her O
classmates O
; O
they O
all O
remember O
her O
French B-NORP
name O
, O
Elodie B-PERSON
, O
and O
let O
her O
know O
that O
I O
'm O
there O
when O
they O
see O
me O
coming O
to O
pick O
her O
up O
after O
school O
. O

We O
owe O
all O
of O
this O
to O
Martine B-PERSON
. O

We O
were O
lucky O
to O
find O
someone O
so O
skilled O
in O
the O
art O
of O
being O
a O
nanny O
. O

She O
helped O
us O
so O
much O
. O

how O

How O

Under O

When O

but O
as O
Mrs. O

explains O
: O
" O
It O
takes O
a O
fairly O
long O
time O
to O
make O
larou O
, O
and O
you O
have O
to O
make O
allowance O
for O
the O
weather O
. O

It O
's O
best O
to O
get O
going O
early O
so O
that O
you O
have O
the O
meat O
ready O
to O
give O
out O
to O
friends O

in O

" O

Her O
ever O

popular O
larou O
is O
made O
in O

with O
a O

tested O
recipe O

She O
adds O
the O
spices O
in O
their O
special O
proportions O
, O
and O
then O
seals O
the O
meat O
in O
a O
vat O
to O
marinate O
for O
six B-DATE
days I-DATE
so O
as O
to O
ensure O
a O
full O

After O
being O
removed O
from O
the O

the O

slowly O

over O
a O

Finally O
the O

are O
hung O
out O

two B-DATE

in O

For O
Mrs. O
Pu B-PERSON

her O
husband O
, O
the O
traditional O
lunar O

has O
more O
significance O
than O
the O

It O
provides O
the O

Slowly O

up O

The O
timing O
of O
Chinese B-EVENT
New I-EVENT
Year I-EVENT
is O
determined O
by O
the O
traditional O
lunar O
calendar O
and O
marks O
an O
important O
transition O
, O
the O
point O
when O
Winter O
gives O
way O
to O
Spring O
. O

In O
China B-GPE
, O
a O
country O
founded O
on O
farming O
, O
there O
has O
always O
been O
a O
tangible O
link O
between O
seasonal O
changes O
and O
the O
pattern O
of O
agricultural O
production O
. O

As O
this O
link O
was O
absorbed O
into O
people O
's O
lives O
it O
gave O
rise O
to O
the O
rituals O
of O
rural O
existence O
, O
the O
most O
prominent O
of O
which O
marked O
the O
conclusion O
of O
the O
natural O
cycle O
at O
the O
end O
of O
every O
year O
. O

Thus O
New B-EVENT
Year I-EVENT
became O
the O
most O
important O
of O
all O
traditional O
festivals O
, O
symbolizing O
endless O
rebirth O
and O
the O
continuation O
of O
the O
natural O
cycle O
. O

While O
underpinning O
the O
annual O
cycle O
of O
festivals O
and O
the O

, O
this O

comes O
in O

Although O

So O
when O

in O
Shanghai B-GPE
, O
we O
did O

have O

No O

Lin B-PERSON
recalls O
that O
there O
were O

had O
to O

Come O
New B-EVENT

, O
the O

were O
always O
attracted O
by O
the O
unusually O
busy O

in O

, O
and O
loved O
running O
in O

out O

meanwhile O
getting O

Lin B-PERSON

was O

too O
happy O
about O

in O

of O
the O

best O
efforts O
to O
keep O
the O
mood O
light O
. O

Dinner O
was O
nearly O
over O
when O
the O
old O
fellow O
demanded O
that O
his O
children O
come O
to O
his O
side O
, O
and O
announced O
: O
" O
I O
want O
to O
square O
up O
accounts O
with O
every O
one O
of O
you O
, O
each O
in O
turn O
. O
. O
. O
. O
" O

He O
began O
to O
lecture O
them O
about O
how O
hard O
he O
had O
struggled O
in O
his O
youth O
to O
bring O
them O
all O
up O
, O
recalling O
every O
little O
incident O
as O
though O
it O
were O
yesterday B-DATE
. O

He O
broke O
down O
in O
tears O
once O
he O
got O
onto O
the O
things O
that O
had O
hurt O
him O
, O
and O
after O
that O
there O
was O
no O
calming O
him O
down O
. O

" O
He O
had O
absolutely O
no O
idea O
that O
his O
children O
all O
had O
to O
swallow O
their O
own O
share O
of O
hurt O
and O
disappointment O
while O
growing O
up O
, O
but O
never O
complained O
to O
him O
. O

Now O
each O
of O
them O
felt O
afresh O
the O
grievances O
of O
childhood O
, O
and O
began O
to O
strike O
back O
, O
one O
after O
another O
. O
" O

Li B-PERSON
described O
the O
ensuing O
scenario O
: O

" O
Some O
wheeled O
out O
their O
heavy O
artillery O
and O
some O
used O
the O
machine O
- O
gun O
approach O
. O

Cannon O
and O
gunfire O
rang O
out O
on O
that O
cold O
rainy O
night O
, O
while O
tears O
flowed O
and O
fireworks O
exploded O
. O

The O
old O
bruiser O
, O
nearly B-DATE
80 I-DATE
years I-DATE
old O
, O
was O
struck O
speechless O
. O

His O
authority O
lay O
in O
tatters O
, O
long O
since O
torn O
down O
by O
his O
adult O
offspring O
. O

He O
'd O
taken O
so O
many O
hits O
by O
then O
that O
he O
was O
riddled O
with O
bullet O
- O
holes O
. O

He O
slumped O
miserably O
back O
into O
his O
chair O
, O
lips O
quivering O
as O
if O
to O
speak O
, O
but O
no O
words O
coming O
from O
his O
mouth O
. O
" O

The O
evening O
ended O
in O
tears O
and O
awkwardness O
. O

" O
Our O
family O
was O
quite O
poor O
when O
we O
were O
growing O
up O
, O
" O
says O
Li B-PERSON
, O
" O
and O
Father O
suffered O
plenty O
of O
frustrations O
on O
our O
behalf O
. O

He O
thought O
that O
we O
had O
n't O
properly O
repaid O
him O
once O
we O
had O
grown O
up O
, O
and O
felt O
quite O
bitter O
about O
it O
. O

But O
he O
did O
n't O
realize O
that O
we O
too O
, O
growing O
up O
in O
such O
circumstances O
, O
faced O
hardship O
and O
frustration O
. O

Like O
my O
elder O
sister O
who O
had O
to O
work O
her O
way O
through O
school O
. O

Everyone O
had O
something O
to O
get O
off O
his O
chest O
. O

It O
all O
got O
quite O
heated O
. O
" O

Li O
felt O
depressed O
and O
guilty O
about O
the O
way O
the O
evening O
turned O
out O
. O

When O
he O
went O
over O
to O
his O
parents O
house O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
day I-DATE
to O
pay O
his O
New B-EVENT
Year I-EVENT
respects O
, O
he O
asked O
his O
children O
to O
help O
smooth O
things O
over O
, O

he O
scrubbed O
clean O
the O
toilet O
bowl O

the O

cancelled O

" O

decided O
to O
take O
a O

My O
family O
and O
I O
like O
the O
unusual O
quiet O
that O
descends O
on O
Taipei B-GPE
's O
streets O
for O
the O
period O
of O
the O
festival O
, O
and O
since O
we O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
make O
any O
special O
arrangements O
, O
we O
just O
stayed O
home O
and O
had O
a O

" O
What O
we O
are O
missing O
, O
" O
says O

Yang B-PERSON
Hsiao I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
yun I-PERSON
, O
" O
is O
a O
way O
of O
bringing O
new O
meaning O
into O
the O
old O
tradition O
, O
a O
way O
of O
spending O
New B-EVENT
Year I-EVENT
that O
suits O
ordinary O
people O
. O
" O

Yang B-PERSON
's O
strongest O
association O
with O
New B-EVENT
Year I-EVENT
is O
of O
going O
to O
do O
the O
New B-EVENT
Year I-EVENT
's I-EVENT
shopping O
with O
the O
grown O
- O
ups O
when O
she O
was O
little O
. O

" O
We O
were O
always O
very O
thrifty O
in O
those O
days O
, O
without O
extra O
cash O
for O
new O
things O
. O

New B-EVENT
Year I-EVENT
was O
the O
only O
time O
when O
we O
got O
to O
bring O
bulging O
bags O
and O
packages O
back O
to O
the O
house O
. O

Just O
the O
sight O
of O
all O
those O
treats O
- O
chicken O
, O
duck O
, O
fish O
and O
pork O
; O
candies O
and O
cookies O
; O
fruits O
and O
soda O
drinks O
- O
was O
a O
thrill O
for O
us O
. O

Then O
there O
were O
all O
the O
New B-EVENT
Year I-EVENT
presents O
, O
like O
new O
clothes O
, O
shoes O
and O
hats O
. O

At O
New B-EVENT
Year I-EVENT
our O
parents O
liked O
to O
dress O
the O
girls O
in O
red O
from O
head O
to O
toe O
, O
for O
good O
luck O
and O
for O
fun O
. O

We O
looked O
as O
if O
we O
'd O
been O
dipped O
in O
a O
tub O
of O
haw O
juice O
. O
" O

In O
spite O
of O
the O
excitement O
that O
she O
remembered O
feeling O
, O
as O
a O
child O
, O
about O
getting O
to O
wear O
new O
clothes O
and O
new O
hats O
, O
Yang B-PERSON
later O
began O
to O
question O
this O
way O
of O
spending O
New B-EVENT
Year I-EVENT
. O

She O
felt O
especially O
turned O
off O
by O
the O
orgy O
of O
consumption O
connected O
with O
the O
festival O
. O

" O
It O
was O
only O
after O
I O
had O
kids O
of O
my O
own O
that O
I O
began O
to O
rethink O
the O
importance O
of O
New B-EVENT
Year I-EVENT
- O
partly O
out O
of O
nostalgia O
, O
and O
partly O
to O
pass O
the O
tradition O
on O
to O
my O
children O
, O
" O
admits O
Yang B-PERSON
. O

Nowadays O
she O
emphasizes O
just O
three B-CARDINAL
aspects O
of O
the O
occasion O
: O
getting O
the O
family O
together O
, O
enjoying O
the O
festive O
spirit O
, O
and O
having O
a O
rest O
. O

" O
At O
one B-CARDINAL
point O
we O
tried O
the O
fashionable O
thing O
, O
taking O
the O
family O
away O
for O
a O
vacation O
, O
but O
being O
abroad O
we O
really O
missed O
that O
festive O
flavor O
. O
" O

Eventually O
she O
returned O
to O
the O
traditional O
form O
, O
making O
the B-EVENT
New I-EVENT
Year I-EVENT
's I-EVENT
Eve I-EVENT
dinner O
herself O
, O
and O
always O
including O
a O
Manchurian B-NORP

the O
way O
her O

used O
to O
do O
it O

as O
busy O
and O
stressful O
as O
it O
is O
the B-DATE
rest I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
we O
decided O
to O
drop O
the O
formal O
New B-EVENT
Year I-EVENT
gathering O
. O

Instead O
, O
we O
now O
spend O
the O
time O
relaxing O
at O
home O
, O
doing O
whatever O
we O
fancy O
, O
be O
it O
sitting O
quietly O
and O
reading O
, O
listening O
to O

, O
going O
on O
an O

or O
talking O
about O
the O
ups O

downs O
of O
the B-DATE

we O
might O
invite O
a O

of O
close O
friends O
round O
to O
reminisce O
about O
old O
times O

It O
's O
quiet O

and O
it O

really O
satisfying O

continues O
Yang B-PERSON
, O
" O
the B-DATE
end I-DATE
of I-DATE

also O
serve O
as O
a O
reminder O
for O
people O
to O
review O
their O
past O
actions O

She O
always O
sets O
aside O
a O
little O
time O
for O
herself O
on O
New B-EVENT

to O
do O
just O
this O

As O
midnight O
approaches O

with O
all O
the O

taken O

Yang B-PERSON
settles O
down O

quietly O
reflect O
on O
how O

grown O
during O

nothing O

It O

achieved O

in O

" O

Yang B-PERSON
feels O
that O
if O
we O
redefine O
New B-EVENT
Year I-EVENT
in O
terms O
of O
its O
contemplative O
and O
spiritual O
meaning O
, O
rather O
than O
just O
regarding O
it O
as O
an O
occasion O
for O
feasting O
and O
partying O
, O
then O
we O
can O
better O
sense O
how O
time O
passes O
, O
and O
see O
that O
another O
phase O
in O
our O
working O
lives O
has O
been O
completed O

In O
this O
way O
we O
can O
make O
our O
wishes O
for O
the O

ahead O
, O
setting O
goals O
for O

for O

without O

about O

the O

all O

assured O

on O

that O
his O

will O
redefine O

to O
eliminate O

category O

, O
" O
which O
has O
stirred O
up O
so O
much O
controversy O
. O

Instead O
, O
said O
Wang B-PERSON
, O
the O
MJIB B-ORG
will O
concentrate O
on O
" O
investigating O
criminal O
activities O
and O
countering O
the O
attempts O
of O
individuals O
-LRB- O
and O
organizations O
-RRB- O
from O
mainland O
China B-GPE
and O
foreign O
countries O
to O
infiltrate O
or O

Taiwan B-GPE

" O

Questions O
concerning O
the O
proper O
role O
and O
jurisdiction O
of O
the O
MJIB B-ORG
have O
reopened O
public O
debate O
on O
political O
surveillance O
. O

The O
MJIB B-ORG
is O
responsible O
for O
both O
political O
intelligence O
gathering O
and O
criminal O
investigations O
, O
and O
is O
nominally O
under O
the B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
of I-ORG
Justice I-ORG
. O

Its O
work O
overlaps O
with O
that O
of O
the O
NSB B-ORG
, O
and O
the O
existence O
of O
two B-CARDINAL
different O
chains O
of O
command O
inevitably O
creates O
problems O
. O

The O
IRA B-ORG
has O
pointed O
out O
, O
for O
example O
, O
that O
MJIB B-ORG
investigators O
often O
receive O
oral O
instructions O
from O
the O
NSB O
to O
collect O
information O
on O
a O
particular O
political O
party O
. O

The B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
of I-ORG
Justice I-ORG
, O
in O
the O
meantime O
, O
repeatedly O
calls O
upon O
the O
MJIB B-ORG
to O
stop O
doing O
work O
not O
related O
to O
national O
security O
or O
crime O
prevention O
, O
and O
demands O
that O
they O
maintain O
strict O
political O
neutrality O
. O

Investigators O
complain O
that O
they O
do O
n't O
know O
who O
to O
listen O
to O
, O
and O
it O
is O
difficult O
for O
them O
to O
concentrate O
on O
their O
work O
and O
play O
their O
proper O
role O
in O
the O
justice O
system O
. O

The O
intelligence O
apparatus O
is O
supposedly O
subject O
to O
supervision O
by O
the O
legislature O
, O
which O
wields O
budgetary O
authority O
over O
these O
agencies O
and O
has O
the O
power O
to O
review O
internal O
administrative O
documents O
that O
do O
not O
contain O
classified O
information O
. O

In O
reality O
, O
however O
, O
intelligence O
operations O
are O
extremely O
secretive O
, O
and O
legislators O
can O
do O
little O
to O
hold O
them O
in O
check O
. O

Taiwan B-GPE
now O
faces O
two B-CARDINAL
very O
pressing O
tasks O
related O
to O
its O
intelligence O
operations O
. O

The O
jurisdiction O
of O
the O
MJIB B-ORG
, O
for O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
, O
must O
be O
clarified O
. O

And O
secondly B-ORDINAL
, O
our O
domestic O
intelligence O
activities O
must O
be O
subject O
to O
effective O
oversight O
so O
that O
no O
government O
of O
any O
stripe O
will O
ever O
again O
engage O
in O
repression O
of O
its O
political O
opponents O
. O

Obviously O

The O

for O

there O

Although O
this O

offers O
the O
following O
analysis O
: O
Currently O
the O
PRC B-GPE
weapons O
which O
pose O
the O
greatest O
threat O
to O
Taiwan B-GPE
are O
Sukhoi B-PRODUCT
aircraft I-PRODUCT
, O
M O
- O
class O
missiles O
, O
and O
cruise O
missiles O
. O

Of O
these O
, O
the O
aircraft O
are O
already O
strategically O
of O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
rank O
, O
but O
Taiwan B-GPE
must O
be O
alert O
to O
the O
missiles O
. O

The O
M O
- O
class O
weapons O
can O
pass O
through O
the O
stratosphere O
directly O
into O
Taiwan B-GPE
's O
rear O
areas O
, O
while O
cruise O
missiles O
can O
undertake O
low O
- O
level O
long O
- O
range O
attacks O
. O

" O
We O
can O
defend O
against O
the O
M O
- O
class O
missiles O
with O
our O
Patriot O
missile O
defense O
system O
, O
but O
we O
currently O
have O
only O
limited O
ability O
to O
intercept O
cruise O
missiles O
. O

The O
most O
important O
subject O
for O
the O
moment O
is O
to O
rethink O
air O
defense O
strategy O
, O
" O
he O
says O
. O

Missile O
difficulties O

Any O
discussion O
of O
missiles O
also O
involves O
many O
other O
issues O
, O
including O
international O
strategy O
and O
domestic O
civilian O
morale O
. O

From O
the O
point O
of O
view O
of O
international O
strategy O
, O
the O
US B-GPE
clearly O
does O
not O
want O
Taiwan B-GPE
to O
develop O
its O
own O
offensive O
missile O
capability O
. O

The O
US B-GPE
responded O
negatively O
to O
Lien B-PERSON
Chan I-PERSON

proposal O
to O
build O
long O

. O

At O

US B-GPE
Under O

John B-PERSON

the O

The O
US B-GPE
has O
always O
been O
responsible O
for O
strategic O
deterrence O
, O
while O
Taiwan B-GPE
handles O
local O
tactical O
defense O
. O

If O
Taiwan B-GPE
were O
to O
develop O
long O

range O
missiles O
, O
this O
would O
change O
Taiwan B-GPE

defensive O
posture O
, O
and O
alter O
the O
Taiwan B-GPE
- O
US B-GPE

There O
is O
another O
possibility O
for O
Taiwan B-GPE
in O
defending O
against O
the O
threat O
of O
missiles O
from O
the O
PRC B-GPE
. O

Besides O
building O
offensive O

, O
Taiwan B-GPE
could O
also O
join O
the O
US B-GPE

But O
this O
may O

be O

editor O

in O

chief O
of O

. O

He O
says O
that O
if O
Taiwan B-GPE
were O
to O
join O
the O
TMD B-ORG
this O
would O
be O
a O
return O
to O
a O
situation O
of O
joint O
US B-GPE
- O
Taiwan B-GPE
defense O
, O
such O
as O
existed O
during O
the B-EVENT
Cold I-EVENT
War I-EVENT
, O
when O
Taiwan B-GPE
was O
on O
the O
frontline O
in O
a O
chain O
of O
islands O
surrounding O
China B-GPE
. O

For O
the O
PRC B-GPE
, O
which O
is O
endeavoring O
to O
move O
from O
coastal O
defense O
to O
a O
blue O
- O
water O
capability O
, O
the O
provocation O
would O
be O
enormous O
. O

The B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
has O
thus O
been O
deliberately O
unclear O
- O
it O
does O
not O
exclude O
Taiwan B-GPE
from O
the O
TMD B-ORG
, O
but O
it O
has O
not O
clearly O
said O
that O
Taiwan B-GPE
would O
be O
included O
. O

In O
any O
case O
, O
says O
Lin B-PERSON
Chong I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
pin I-PERSON
, O
vice-chairman O
of O
the O
ROC B-GPE
's O
Mainland B-ORG

, O
potential O
TMD B-ORG
buyers O
still O
do O
not O
know O
where O
the O
money O
would O
come O
from O
, O
while O
the O
TMD B-ORG
producer O
has O
not O
yet O
come O
up O
with O
a O
finished O
product O
. O

So O
this O
is O
still O
just O
a O
political O
debating O
point O
, O
and O
it O
is O
too O
early O
to O
talk O
about O
any O
impact O
on O
the O
military O
situation O
in O
the B-LOC
Taiwan I-LOC

. O

Domestic O
morale O

Thus O
, O
from O
the O
international O
strategic O
angle O
, O
it O
still O
seems O
most O
practical O
for O
Taiwan B-GPE
to O
have O
its O
own O
missile O
systems O
. O

Moreover O
, O
this O
is O
also O
necessary O
from O
the O
point O
of O
view O
of O
public O
opinion O
. O

In O
an O
analysis O
of O
the O
threat O
that O
guided O
missiles O
pose O
to O
morale O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
ROC B-GPE
Minister O
of O
Defense O
Tang B-PERSON
Fei I-PERSON
points O
out O
that O
perhaps O
for O
some O
countries O
a O
missile O
attack O
would O
have O
little O
impact O
. O

But O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
where O
resources O
are O
concentrated O
, O
missiles O
pose O
a O
serious O
threat O
to O
electrical O
power O
and O
petroleum O
production O
, O
to O
transportation O
-LRB- O

, O

, O

, O
and O
to O

More O
importantly O
, O
he O
says O
, O
the O
citizens O
of O
Taiwan B-GPE
are O
not O
psychologically O
prepared O
. O

There O
has O
been O
no O
war O
for O
decades B-DATE
now O
, O
and O
there O
are O
even O
very O
few O
usable O
civil O
defense O

. O

If O
the O
PRC B-GPE
were O
to O
launch O
200 B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
300 I-CARDINAL
guided O
missiles O
against O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
although O
the O
damage O
to O
industry O
, O
power O
, O
and O
communications O
would O
probably O
not O
be O
as O
serious O
as O
was O
caused O
by O
the B-EVENT
September I-EVENT
21 I-EVENT
earthquake I-EVENT
, O
citizens O
are O
not O
psychologically O
prepared O
for O

, O
and O
the O

might O
not O
be O

to O

Chung B-PERSON
Chien I-PERSON
, O
an O
expert O
on O

, O
says O
that O
the O
turbulence O
created O
in O
the O
public O
mind O
by O
the O
1996 B-DATE
PRC B-GPE
missile O
tests O
has O
not O
abated O
even O
today B-DATE
. O

The O
construction O
of O
an O

system O
is O
the O
main O
military O
problem O
in O
bringing O
peace O
of O

to O

Thus O
, O
in O
the O

, O
although O

not O
be O
said O
to O
be O
" O

it O
is O
still O
an O
important O
" O

that O
many O

Beyond O

If O

can O
not O
develop O
long O

the O

what O

missiles I-PRODUCT
have O
defensive O

But O
pure O

not O

Even O
if O

be O
99 B-PERCENT

effective O

and O
only O
one O

the O

still O
be O

Thus O
, O
it O
would O
be O
more O
effective O
to O
build O
an O

to O
deter O
the O

Taiwan B-GPE

Some O

see O
in O

an O
opportunity O
to O
seize O
a O
decisive O
advantage O
in O
the O
face O
of O
a O
future O
armed O
threat O
from O
mainland O
China B-GPE
. O

To O
be O
sure O
, O
because O
of O
the O
domestic O
development O
of O
the O
electronics O
industry O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
the O
ROC B-GPE
has O
a O
certain O
advantage O
. O

The O
military O
is O
currently O
actively O
studying O
the O
construction O
of O

, O
and O
it O
hopes O
to O
cooperate O
with O
the O
private O
sector O
and O
utilize O
private O
- O
sector O
computer O
knowledge O
to O
jointly O
deploy O
an O
electronics O

network O
. O

This O
is O
a O
key O
area O
of O
development O
for O
the O
future O
in O
which O
Taiwan B-GPE
can O
rely O
on O
itself O
and O
need O
not O
be O
limited O
by O
what O
can O
be O
procured O
abroad O
. O

Construction O
of O
a O
complete O
defense O
system O
is O
essential O
, O
but O
the O
highest O
form O
of O
military O
strategy O
is O
still O
to O
defeat O
the O
enemy O
without O
firing O
a O
shot O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
pro-active O
defense O
Taiwan B-GPE
is O
currently O
studying O
is O
a O
way O
of O
pursuing O
peace O
. O

Taiwan B-GPE
will O
not O
provoke O
mainland O
China B-GPE
, O
nor O
be O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
to O
resort O
to O
war O
. O

But O
nor O
can O
it O
allow O
the O
PRC B-GPE
to O
think O
that O
Taiwan B-GPE
is O
so O
weak O
that O
the O
PRC B-GPE
will O
be O
tempted O
to O
act O
rashly O
. O

Pro-active O
defense O
is O
necessary O
for O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
but O
the O
real O
goal O
of O
the O
Taiwan B-GPE
side O
is O
peace O
. O

Perhaps O
militarily O
there O
's O
a O
standoff O
situation O
of O
mutual O
intimidation O
, O
but O
what O
Taiwan B-GPE
most O
hopes O
for O
is O
that O
the O
cross-strait O
problem O
can O
be O
peacefully O
resolved O
without O
deploying O
a O
single O
soldier O

This O

notable O

the O

Taiwan B-GPE

In O

as O
no O
more O
than O
a O
tool O
of O

struggle O
, O
and O
a O

indulgent O
body O
at O
that O
, O
generating O
widespread O
consensus O
on O
the O
necessity O

While O
the O

round O
of O

satisfies O
the O
general O
desire O
across O
the O
political O
spectrum O
to O
progressively O
dismantle O
the B-ORG

, O
sloppy O

the O
failure O
of O
the O
various O

to O
propose O

provide O
cause O
for O
new O
concern O
over O
the O
health O
of O

in O
the O
ROC B-GPE
. O

For O
example O
, O
the B-ORG
National I-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
will O
become O
a O
" O
task O

body O
" O
generated O
according O

National B-ORG

, O
an O

points O
out O
that O

10 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
the O
Taiwanese B-NORP
population O
takes O
part O
in O

Thus O
a B-ORG
National I-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
generated O
proportionally O
according O
to O

represents O
suppression O
of O
the O
views O
of O
the B-PERCENT
other I-PERCENT
90 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
the O

, O
and O
thus O
violates O
the O
principle O
of O
vesting O
authority O
over O
constitutional O
government O
in O
the O
people O
. O

Following O
the O
demobilization O
of O
the B-ORG
National I-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
, O
many O
functions O

currently O
held O
by O
the B-ORG
National I-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
will O
be O
transferred O
to O
the B-ORG

This O
in O
turn O
raises O
fears O
in O
the O
academic O
community O
that O
the B-ORG
Legislative I-ORG

could O
become O
an O
untamable O
new O

. O

The O
expanded O
powers O
of O
the B-ORG

also O
include O
the O
impeachment O

of O
the O

vice O

, O
and O
the O
supplementary O

of O

. O

These O
changes O
tighten O
the O
relationship O
between O
the O
parliament O
and O
the O

, O
requiring O
the O
president O
to O
report O
to O
the B-ORG

on O
the O

of O
the O
nation O
. O

But O
the O
president O
has O
only O
the O
passive O
authority O
to O
dissolve O
the O
parliament O
. O

In O
the O
face O
of O

with O
supreme O
powers O
, O
a O
president O
whose O
party O
claims O
only O
a O

powerless O
even O
to O
replace O
a O

, O
leaving O
him O

A O
China B-ORG

editorial O
urged O
that O
the O
question O
of O
whether O
the O
enormous O
Legislative B-ORG

be O
split O
into O

The O

, O
a O
professor O

at O
Taipei B-ORG

, O
Confucian B-NORP
thought O
does O
include O
emphasis O
on O
human O
rights O
, O
such O
as O
the O
expectation O
that O
fathers O
should O
be O
" O

" O

What O
it O

is O
propose O

a O

who O

not O

and O
a O

who O
is O
not O
benevolent O
. O

Tang B-PERSON
feels O
that O
Confucian B-NORP
thought O
basically O
stresses O
obligations O
, O
but O
that O
in O
modern O
society O
the O
idea O
of O
obligations O
is O
no O
longer O
a O
straightforward O
matter O
: O
when O
person O
A O
neglects O
to O
fulfil O
his O
obligations O
, O
person O
B O
can O
be O
said O
to O
have O
been O
deprived O
of O
his O
rights O
. O

But O
when O
we O
start O
out O
from O
the O
notion O
of O
rights O
, O
and O
support O
those O
rights O
with O
legal O
guarantees O
, O
we O
find O
it O
is O
better O
to O
have O
guaranteed O
rights O
than O
to O
depend O
on O
everyone O
fulfilling O
their O
obligations O
. O

The O

, O
have O
a O

is O
to O

we O

here O

As O
Tang B-PERSON

points O
out O
, O
this O
means O
that O
parents O
expect O
their O

to O
perform O
outstandingly O
well O
at O
school O
. O

The O
importance O
that O
parents O
attach O
to O
education O
is O
of O
course O
a O
strong O
point O
for O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
but O
one B-CARDINAL
drawback O
of O
this O
is O
that O
parents O
often O
set O
their O
expectations O
too O
high O
. O

At O
an O
age O
when O
most O
kids O
in O
the O
West B-LOC
are O
still O
playing O
every O
day O
, O
our O
children O
have O
already O
started O
shuttling O
about O
among O
supplementary O
schools O
for O
classes O
in O
English B-LANGUAGE
, O
computers O
, O
abacus O
and O
art O
. O

Tang B-PERSON
explains O
that O
although O
Western B-NORP
children O
seem O
to O
be O
playing O
about O
, O
they O
are O
also O
finding O
out O
what O
interests O
them O
, O
and O
they O
have O
plenty O
of O
chances O
to O
change O
direction O
. O

Here O
, O
however O
, O
the O
education O
system O
gives O
children O
hardly O
any O
opportunity O
for O
making O
choices O
, O
and O
education O
is O
foisted O
on O
them O
rather O
than O
being O
something O
they O
seek O
for O
themselves O
. O

Says O
Tang B-PERSON
: O
" O
A O
lot O
of O
people O
these O
days O
hide O
themselves O
at O
graduate O
school O
, O
partly O
to O
put O
off O
confronting O
reality O
and O
partly O
to O
continue O
meeting O
their O

' O
expectations O
. O

Nowadays O
we O
even O
have O
cram O
schools O
for O
graduate O
school O
students O
. O
" O

However O
, O
the O
Western B-NORP
educational O
model O
, O
in O
which O
children O
are O
shown O
respect O
and O
allowed O
to O
decide O
and O
choose O
for O
themselves O
, O
is O
not O
without O
drawbacks O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
American B-NORP
- O
who O
was O
pushing O
forty B-DATE
by O
the O
time O
he O
earned O
his O
PhD B-WORK_OF_ART

says O
that O
when O
he O
was O
younger O
, O
whenever O
he O
had O
an O
important O
choice O
to O
make O
about O
his O
future O
and O
asked O
his O
parents O
for O
their O

the O
response O
was O
: O
" O
We O
'll O
respect O
and O
support O
you O
no O

what O
you O
decide O
! O
" O

Now O
he O
feels O
that O
he O
has O
squandered O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
because O
of O
vacillation O
and O
a O
lack O
of O

it O
is O
no O
wonder O
that O

find O
themselves O
at O
a O
bit O
of O

The O
difficulty O
is O
that O
they O
ca O
n't O
simply O
dismiss O
deeply O
ingrained O
traditional O

at O

The O

is O
there O
but O
it O
has O

this O
accounts O
for O
the O
gap O
that O
can O
often O

An O

says O
that O

use O
praise O
without O
making O
it O
clear O
to O
the O
child O
just O
what O
he O
is O
being O
praised O
for O
, O
and O
this O
" O
cheats O
" O
the O
child O
rather O
than O
showing O
him O
true O
respect O
. O

It O
's O
the O
process O
that O
counts O

A O
child O
who O
is O
treated O
with O
respect O
wo O
n't O
stop O
studying O
on O
account O

this O
. O

And O
a O
child O
who O
is O
free O
to O
make O
his O
own O
choices O
does O
n't O
automatically O
turn O
into O

a O

In O
the O
past O

too O
much O
emphasis O
on O

good O

encouraged O
the O

which O

are O
crudely O

Stressing O
children O

is O
one O
way O
to O
change O
that O
mentality O
, O
and O
there O
is O
basically O
nothing O
un-Asian B-NORP
about O
using O
respect O
and O
enlightenment O
to O
pursue O
the O
very O
best O
outcome O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
we O
need O
to O
draw O
on O
the O
strengths O
of O
both O
Eastern B-NORP
and O
Western B-NORP
culture O

to O
show O
that O

global O

that O

in O

, O
who O
has O
been O

says O
that O
all O
the O

very O

with O
the O

After O
returning O
home O
most O

produce O

their O

Unfortunately O
, O
it O
is O
very O
difficult O
for O
them O
to O
apply O
the O
technical O
infomation O
they O
learned O
, O
because O
in O
most O
cases O
they O
lack O
the O
hardware O
and O
facilities O
available O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
. O

Thus O
they O
are O
only O
able O
to O
apply O
the O
theoretical O
insights O
they O
picked O
up O
to O
their O
own O

Chu B-PERSON

the O

It O
is O
said O
that O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
hottest O
subjects O
in O
post-martial O
law O
Taiwan B-GPE
have O
been O
sex O
and O
personal O
money O

, O
which O
certainly O
goes O
to O
show O
the O
degree O
of O
openness O
and O
pluralism O
in O
today B-DATE

society O
. O

Moreover O
, O
like O
sex O
, O
personal O
money O
management O
is O
something O
that O
many O
people O
only O
vaguely O
understand O
, O
that O
they O
feel O
uncertain O
about O
committing O
themselves O
to O
, O
and O
that O
leaves O
them O
feeling O
tired O
and O
empty O
. O

Personal O
money O
management O
is O
now O
a O
national O
sport O
. O

The O
wealthy O
hope O
to O
roll O
their O
money O
over O
, O
while O
those O
less O
well O
off O
are O
trying O
to O
make O
a O
small O
pile O
of O
their O
own O
. O

But O
what O
kind O
of O
money O
management O
approach O
is O
best O
suited O
to O
the B-DATE
current I-DATE
era I-DATE
? O

How O
can O
one O
win O
in O
the O

game O
without O
losing O
the O

in O
the O

? O

" O
Earning O
money O
is O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
priority O
, O
spending O

is O
a O
sin O

Thus O

and O
the O

then O

in O

This O

, O
who O
is O

, O
so O
in O
order O
to O
build O
up O
a O

, O
she O
will O
not O

a O

she O

Yet O
, O
all O
her O

can O
not O

And O
sometimes O

His O

that O

If O

Dennis B-PERSON
Chien I-PERSON
of O
the O

website O
called O
JP B-ORG
Investment I-ORG
Clinic I-ORG
strikes O
a O
cautionary O
note O
: O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
the O
education O
system O
has O
fulfilled O
its O
responsibility O
to O
teach O
people O
how O
to O
manage O
their O
money O
. O
" O

Chien B-PERSON
points O
out O
that O
school O
textbooks O
only O
teach O
moral O
lessons O
like O
" O
a B-MONEY
penny I-MONEY
saved O
is O
a B-MONEY
penny I-MONEY
earned O
, O
" O
which O
are O
not O
exactly O
what O
the O
real O
world O
demands O
these B-DATE
days I-DATE
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
many O
American B-NORP
children O
understand O
a O
bit O
about O
money O
management O
from O
early O
on O
. O

For O
example O
, O
a O
child O
in O
her B-DATE
early I-DATE
teens I-DATE
might O
babysit O
for O
the O
neighbors O
or O
cut O
lawns O
, O
and O
then O
put O
the O
money O
in O
a O
mutual O
fund O
. O

Some O
investment O
websites O
have O
games O
for O
children O
to O
teach O
them O
about O
various O
investment O
instruments O
and O
portfolios O
. O

These O
treat O
personal O
money O
management O
as O
a O
serious O
life O
skill O
that O
all O
modern O
people O
should O
know O
. O

Chien B-PERSON
says O
that O
the O
situation O
is O
just O
like O
sex O
education O
in O
the O
past O
. O

They O
give O
it O
only O
the O
most O
cursory O
treatment O
in O
schools O
, O
but O
most O
people O
have O
a O
strong O
desire O
to O
find O
out O
about O
it O
, O
so O
as O
a O
result O
they O
have O
to O
pick O
up O
what O
they O
can O
from O
the O
newspapers O
or O
cable O
TV O
. O

The O
result O
of O
the O
lack O
of O
a O
proper O
investment O
outlook O
is O
that O
speculation O
is O
rampant O
. O

According O
to O
statistics O
of O
the B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
of I-ORG
Finance I-ORG
, O
87.5 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
the O
trading O
volume O
on O
the O
Taiwan B-GPE
stock O
exchange O
comes O
from O
individual O
investors O
. O

In O
1999 B-DATE
turnover O
was O
288 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
-LRB- O
that O
is O
, O
total O
trading O
volume O
was O
2.88 B-CARDINAL
times O
the O

-RRB- O
, O
which O
, O
though O
considerably O
down O
from O
nearly O
600 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
ten B-DATE

before I-DATE
, O
remained O
four B-CARDINAL
times O
higher O
than O
the B-ORG
New I-ORG

. O

Despite O
numerous O
painful O
lessons O
in O
the O
past O
, O
the O
habit O
of O
chasing O
a O
rising O
market O
and O
cutthroat O
selling O
in O
a O
falling O
market O
has O
proven O
difficult O
to O
change O
. O

A O
new O
climate O
for O
the O
e-generation O

Fortunately O
, O
over O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
three I-DATE
years I-DATE
foreign O
investors O
have O
brought O
some O
new O
ideas O
into O
the O
country O
. O

Although O
they O
still O
engage O
in O
" O
hit O
- O
and O
- O
run O
" O
high O
- O
volume O
trading O
for O
quick O
gains O
, O
at O
least O
most O
foreign O
investors O
ignore O
gossip O
and O
do O
n't O
touch O
the O
more O
speculative O
stocks O
. O

Rather O
, O
they O
put O
more O
emphasis O
on O
the O
fundamentals O
of O
a O
given O
company O
or O
industry O
. O

Dennis B-PERSON
Chien I-PERSON
notes O
that O
foreign O
firms O
have O
also O
introduced O
risk O
management O
ideas O
like O
" O
having O
a O
well O
- O
rounded O
portfolio O
" O
-LRB- O
i.e. O
" O
do O
n't O
put O
all O
your O
eggs O
in O
one B-CARDINAL
basket O
" O
-RRB- O
. O

These O
have O
had O
a O
positive O
impact O
on O
the O
local O
stock O
market O
, O
and O
have O
given O
the O
investment O
activities O
of O
the O
e-generation O
a O
more O
rational O
foundation O
than O
those O
of O
their O
parents O
. O

The O
chief O
characteristics O
of O
the O
current O
wave O
of O
e-generation O
personal O
money O
management O
are O
great O
ambition O
, O
reliance O
on O
expert O
analysis O
, O
and O
diversification O
of O
investment O
targets O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
hottest O
investments O
are O
always O
changing O
, O
and O
perhaps O
no O
amount O
of O
rational O
analysis O
or O
detailed O
information O
will O
be O
able O
to O
change O
this O
. O

and O
offers O
the O
following O
thoughts O
about O
trends O
in O
money O

Chia B-PERSON
recalls O
that O
in O
the B-DATE
1960s I-DATE
, O
people O
were O
too O
poor O
to O
have O
any O
money O
to O
manage O
; O
there O
were O
also O
fears O
of O
war O
, O
and O
so O
any O
money O
people O
did O
have O
they O
quickly O
exchanged O
for O
gold O
or O
US B-GPE
dollars O
on O
the O
black O
market O
. O

In O
the B-DATE
1970s I-DATE
, O
faced O
with O
two B-CARDINAL
oil O
crises O
and O
inflation O
, O
the O
idea O
of O
buying O
property O
to O
preserve O
value O
became O
widespread O
, O
and O
those O
who O
could O
afford O
it O
bought O
land O
and O
houses O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
the O
stock O
market O
had O
only O
a B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
or I-CARDINAL
so I-CARDINAL
listed O
companies O
, O
and O
its O
fate O
depended O
on O
a O
few O
manipulators O
behind O
the O
scenes O
. O

It O
was O
seen O
as O
a O
" O
cannibalistic O
market O
" O
which O
scared O
off O
most O
citizens O

The O
past O

The O
real O
fad O
for O
personal O

only O
hit O
Taiwan B-GPE
in O
the B-DATE
mid-1980s I-DATE
. O

It O
was O
then O
that O
the O
country O
's O
accumulated O
economic O
resources O
began O
to O
come O
to O
the O
surface O
. O

The O
huge O
trade O
surplus O
built O
up O
over O
many B-DATE
years I-DATE
caused O
the O
NT O
dollar O
to O
appreciate O
, O
and O
attracted O
a O
huge O
amount O
of O
speculative O
foreign O
money O
into O
Taiwan B-GPE
. O

The O
stock O
market O
index O
rose O
from O
600 B-CARDINAL
or O
so O
in O
1985 B-DATE
to O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
12,000 I-CARDINAL
by O
1990 B-DATE
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
price O
of O
property O
rose O
from O
an O
average O
of O
NT$ B-MONEY

in O

. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
great O
opportunities O
for O
making O
money O
stared O
one O
right O
in O
the O
face O
. O

In O
pursuit O
of O
overnight O
wealth O
, O
many O
people O
mortgaged O
their O
property O
to O
buy O
stocks O
, O
and O
then O
used O
their O
stocks O
as O
collateral O
to O
borrow O
more O
money O
, O
creating O
a O
vicious O
cycle O
that O
laid O
the O
foundation O
for O
the O
burst O
bubble O
and O
huge O
debts O
of O
later O

" O
In O

you O

Those O

Six B-DATE

Congratulating O

Mrs. O

in O
the O
US B-GPE
in O
the B-DATE
1960s I-DATE

1970s I-DATE
was O
due O
to O
underlying O
structural O
factors O
: O

The O
large O
generation O
of O
" O
baby O

" O
were O
starting O
careers O
and O
families O
, O
thereby O
increasing O
demand O
for O

. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
some O
of O
the O
older O
generation O
about O
to O
retire O
happily O
sold O
their O
houses O
to O
the O
younger O
at O
high O
prices O
. O

The O
large O
profits O
they O
earned O
attracted O
numerous O
speculators O
into O
the O

and O
prices O
were O
driven O
even O
higher O
, O
encouraging O
construction O

But O
now O
that O
most O

Their O

temporary O

A O

the O

Chang B-PERSON

an O

two B-DATE

" O
The O

Jessica B-PERSON
Liu I-PERSON
, O
who O
personally O
feels O
little O
anxiety O
about O

, O
points O
out O
that O
one O
of O
her O
core O
principles O
for O
investing O
is O
to O
not O
compare O
herself O
with O
others O
. O

" O
This O
is O
because O
I O
know O
that O
opportunities O
to O
make O
money O
come O
and O
go O
. O

If O
I O
do O
n't O
make O
a O
lot O
this O
wave O
, O
there O
'll O
be O
another O
wave O
later O
. O
" O

She O
says O
that O
anxiety O
rises O
in O
direct O
proportion O
to O
a O
person O

expectations O
and O
desires O
. O

The O
more O
you O
want O
, O
the O
more O
anxiety O
you O
feel O
, O
and O
the O
greater O
will O
be O
the O
sense O
of O
disappointment O
if O
you O
fail O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
anxiety O
derives O
from O
greed O
. O

" O
If O
you O
buy O
TSMC B-ORG

hoping O
it O

go O

220 B-CARDINAL
within O

because O
that O
's O
what O
you O
need O

make O
your O
final O

then O
it O
only O
goes O
up O
to O
200 B-CARDINAL

you O
'll O
feel O
dissatisfied O
, O
" O
says O
Liu B-PERSON
. O

This O
sense O
of O
disappointment O
is O
completely O
due O
to O
the O
lack O
of O
a O
proper O

the O

it O
all O

She O
says O
that O
today B-DATE

provide O
every O

intelligently O

" O

For O

they O

a O

But O
how O
much O

is O
enough O

That O
depends O
on O
the O
values O

the O

" O
Each O

Chen B-PERSON

After O
all O

in O

there O
should O
be O
more B-CARDINAL

, O

if O

In O

It O
is O
said O
that O
the O
two B-CARDINAL

As O
Jessica B-PERSON

reminds O
us O

an O

a O

the O
point O

Chen O
offers O
a O

insights O
into O
the O
Shanghai O

. O

All O
land O
is O
owned O
by O

, O
so O
when O
you O

, O
you O
do O
n't O
gain O

ownership O
. O

All O
you O
get O
is O
the O
right O
to O

it O
. O

Property O
in O
Shanghai B-GPE
is O
divided O
into O
various O
categories O
, O
and O
Chen B-PERSON
explains O
various O

in O

" O
Foreign O

" O
can O
be O
purchased O

and O

with O

Buildings O

Newly O
arrived O
Taiwanese B-NORP
business O
persons O
often O
make O
bad O
judgments O
if O
they O
plunge O
into O
the O
market O
without O
studying O
it O
carefully O
first O
, O
so O
Chen B-PERSON
suggests O
the O
following O
rules O
of O
thumb O
: O
The O
Shanghai B-GPE
property O
market O
is O
in O
a O
slump O
, O
so O
there O
is O
no O
need O
to O
rush O
into O
a O
purchase O
. O

A O
buyer O
must O
be O
very O
clear O
about O
the O
purpose O
of O
any O
property O
purchase O
. O

It O
is O
safest O
to O
buy O
property O
from O
the B-ORG
Shanghai I-ORG
Municipal I-ORG
Government I-ORG
, O
the O
biggest O
and O
most O
reliable O
real O
estate O
developer O
in O
the O
city O
. O

One O
must O
not O
estimate O
potential O
earnings O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
experience O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
. O

You O
get O
more O
for O
money O
when O
renting O
than O
when O
buying O
. O

You O
must O
stand O
on O
your O
rights O
at O
all O
times O
, O
and O
be O
very O
careful O
not O
to O
let O
friends O
and O
relatives O
use O
their O
personal O
ties O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
you O

of O

, O
everyone O

that O

the O

Single O

" O

Those O
who O
already O

tell O
you O
in O
a O

The O

well O

it O

there O
to O

wisely O

Chen B-PERSON
argues O
that O
allowing O
direct O
travel O
between O
Taiwan B-GPE

the O

would O
make O
it O
much O
more O
difficult O
for O
Taiwanese B-NORP
men O
to O
keep O
mistresses O
in O
the O
mainland O
, O
and O
would O
go O
a O
long O
way O
toward O
clearing O
up O
all O
the O
cross-strait O
marital O
and O
romantic O
problems O
that O
now O
occur O

often O

Chen B-PERSON
offers O
several O
pieces O

all O
who O
would O
head O
for O
Shanghai B-GPE
, O
whether O

In O

of O

the O

have O
participated O
enthusiastically O

not O
irrationally O

Now O
that O
there O
are O
two B-CARDINAL
strong O
parties O
, O
the O
KMT B-ORG

, O
the O
slogan O

" O

has O
become O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
most O
widely O
used O
appeals O
for O
the O

It O
happens O
to O
be O
the O
turn O
of O

this O

In O
the B-DATE

But O
the O

besides O

has O
another O

there O
may O
be O
a O
restructuring O
of O
Taiwan B-GPE

The O
people O

What O

that O
the O

other O
non-KMT B-ORG

The B-ORG
New I-ORG

itself O
, O
which O
is O
on O
the O
edge O
of O

has O
nominated O

Since O

with O
about B-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL

With O
the O

the O

so O
uncertain O
, O
naturally O
the O

have O
been O
focused O
on O

Very O
few O
people O

transcended O
this O
to O
ask O
what O

the O

The O
ROC B-GPE
constitution O
was O
not O
originally O
designed O
as O
a O
presidential O
system O
. O

The O
constitution O
divided O
power O
among O
five B-CARDINAL
branches O
of O
government O
, O
with O
the O
premier O
as O
head O
of O
the O
executive O
branch O
, O
and O
the O
president O
separate O

but O
theoretically O
not O
controlling O
, O
these O
five B-CARDINAL
. O

In O
the O
past O
, O
presidents O
Chiang B-PERSON
Kai I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
shek I-PERSON
and O
Chiang B-PERSON
Ching I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
kuo I-PERSON
were O
the O
de O

unchallenged O
rulers O
of O
the O
nation O
, O
but O
that O
was O
because O
of O
their O
roles O
as O
chairmen O
of O
the O
Kuomintang B-ORG
, O
which O
, O
under O
the O
old O
one B-CARDINAL

party O
system O
, O
outlawed O
any O

They O
were O
president O
because O
they O
were O

not O
powerful O
because O
they O
were O

But O
today B-DATE
times O
have O
changed O

and O
so O
has O
the O

Most O
importantly O
, O
the O
constitutional O

been O

University I-ORG
, O
notes O
that O
the O
president O
had O
always O
enjoyed O
a O
number O
of O
special O
powers O
: O
appointing O
and O
dismissing O
of O
officials O
, O
dissolving O
of O
the O
parliament O
, O
issuing O

and O
the B-ORG

. O

But O
recent O
constitutional O
revisions O
also O
give O
the O
president O
the O
power O
to O
appoint O
the O
premier O
without O
requiring O
approval O
from O
the B-ORG
Legislative I-ORG
Yuan I-ORG
. O

This O
means O
that O
the O
president O
is O
now O
the O
guiding O
figure O
behind O
all O
executive O
branch O
policy O
. O

Of O
course O
President O
Lee B-PERSON
Teng I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
hui I-PERSON
's O
exercise O
of O
such O
powers O
has O
not O
proved O
politically O
destabilizing O
because O
he O
has O
been O
concurrently O
chairman O
of O
the O
KMT B-ORG
, O
which O
enjoys O
a O
majority O
in O
the B-ORG
Legislative I-ORG

. O

However O
, O
if O
the O
opposition O
wins O
the O
presidency O
, O
it O
is O
uncertain O
whether O
the O
president O
and O
legislature O
will O
be O
able O
to O
work O
together O
harmoniously O
. O

If O
there O
are O
conflicts O
, O
this O
could O
spark O
a O
constitutional O
crisis O
. O

Another O
development O
that O
needs O
watching O
is O
that O
direct O
election O
of O
the O
president O
has O
weakened O
political O
parties O
. O

Alexander B-PERSON

states O
that O
voters O
no O
longer O
base O
their O
choice O
primarily O
on O
political O
party O
. O

This O
is O
what O
has O
enabled O
independent O
candidate O
James B-PERSON
Soong I-PERSON
to O
remain O
a O
powerful O
force O
even O
after O
leaving O
the O
KMT B-ORG
. O

Whether O
he O
wins O
or O
not O
, O
his O
candidacy O
signals O
a O
drastic O
change O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE

Lu B-PERSON

in O

the O

even O

positive O

The O
DPP B-ORG
sees O
this O

its O
chance O

The O

if O
there O
were O
a O
transfer O
of O
power O
, O
the O
opposition O
would O
be O
able O
to O
understand O
more O
clearly O
the O
actual O
difficulties O
of O
governing O
and O
to O
see O
more O
clearly O
the O
dark O
corners O
that O
need O
to O
be O
cleaned O
out O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
ruling O
party O
, O
with O
its O
rich O
experience O
in O
governing O
, O
would O
be O
very O
qualified O
to O
play O
the O
role O
of O
overseeing O
the O
DPP B-ORG
, O
and O
a O
defeat O
for O
the O
KMT B-ORG
could O
also O
promote O
its O
internal O
reassessment O
and O
reform O
. O

Were O
Chen B-PERSON

to O
win O
, O
though O
the O
DPP B-ORG
would O
take O
control O
of O

Taiwan B-GPE
's O
current O
two B-CARDINAL

major O

Chen B-PERSON

says O
that O
a O
Chen B-PERSON
victory O
would O
have O
its O
greatest O
impact O
on O
the B-ORG
New I-ORG
Party I-ORG
- O
and O
that O
the O
effect O
would O
be O
positive O
. O

After O
an O
impressive O
start O
, O
the O
NP B-ORG
has O
faded O
steadily O
over O
the O
past O
few O
elections O
, O
and O
suffered O
an O
especially O
sharp O
blow O
in O
the O
election O
for O
mayor O
of O
Taipei B-GPE
two B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
. O

NP B-ORG
votes O
drifted O
to O

jeou I-PERSON
, O
a O
member O
of O
the O
KMT B-ORG

albeit O
not O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
Lee B-PERSON
Teng I-PERSON

personal O
favorites O
-RRB- O
. O

The O
NP B-ORG
candidate O
received O
only O
an O
anemic O
percentage O
of O
the O
ballots O
, O
bringing O
the O
party O
to O
the O
edge O
of O
collapse O
. O

But O
if O
Chen B-PERSON
Shui I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
bian I-PERSON
becomes O
president O
, O
because O
the O
DPP B-ORG
is O
seen O
as O
the O
party O
of O
Taiwan B-GPE
independence O
- O
the O
direct O
antithesis O
of O
the B-ORG
New I-ORG
Party I-ORG
- O
this O
could O
inspire O
NP B-ORG
members O
to O
pull O
together O
, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
give O
the O
party O
the O
status O
and O
ability O
to O
absorb O
the O
forces O
that O
are O
backing O
James B-PERSON
Soong I-PERSON
. O

This O
would O
contribute O
to O
the O
building O
of O
a O
true O
three B-CARDINAL
- O
party O
system O
. O

An O
opposition O
- O
controlled O
legislature O

If O
Chen B-PERSON
Shui I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
bian I-PERSON
is O
elected O
, O
his O
biggest O
challenge O
will O
come O
from O
the B-ORG
Legislative I-ORG
Yuan I-ORG
, O
and O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
problem O
will O
be O
naming O
a O
premier O
. O

Although O
the O
constitution O
stipulates O
that O
the O
president O
does O
not O
need O
the O
approval O
of O
the B-ORG
Legislative I-ORG
Yuan I-ORG
to O
name O
a O
premier O
, O
given O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
KMT B-ORG
has O
a O
majority O
there O
, O
Chen B-PERSON
faces O
the O
problem O
of O
finding O
a O
premier O
who O
will O
be O
able O
to O
work O
with O
KMT B-ORG
legislators O
. O

The O
Chen B-PERSON
camp O
is O
well O
aware O
of O
this O
problem O
. O

Therefore O
they O
have O
let O
it O
be O
known O
that O
Chen B-PERSON
would O
like O
to O
ask O
Lee B-PERSON
Yuan I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
tse I-PERSON
, O
the O
universally O
respected O
Nobel B-WORK_OF_ART
Prize I-WORK_OF_ART
winner O
who O
is O
currently O
president O
of O
the B-ORG
Academia I-ORG
Sinica I-ORG
, O
to O
be O
his O
premier O
. O

Chen B-PERSON
, O
who O
knows O
that O
within O
the O
DPP B-ORG
there O
is O
little O
high O
- O
level O
governing O
experience O
, O
has O
repeatedly O
raised O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
" O
coalition O
government O
. O
" O

However O
, O
it O
should O
be O
noted O
, O
there O
are O
after O
all O
great O
ideological O
differences O
between O
the O
DPP B-ORG
and O
the O
other O
parties O
. O

KMT B-ORG
legislator O
Li B-PERSON
Hsien I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
jen I-PERSON
points O
out O
that O
the O
DPP B-ORG
retains O
advocacy O
of O
Taiwan B-GPE
independence O
in O
its O
party O
platform O
, O
and O
DPP B-ORG
vice-presidential O
candidate O
Annette B-PERSON
Lu I-PERSON
is O
well O
known O
for O
her O
support O
of O
Taiwan B-GPE
independence O
. O

It O
is O
therefore O
hard O
to O
guarantee O
that O
the O
executive O
branch O
will O
not O
come O
into O
conflict O
with O
the O
legislature O
. O

In O
such O
a O
conflict O
, O
the O
premier O
would O
be O
caught O
in O
the O
crossfire O
. O

The O
legislature O
could O
pass O
a O
vote O
of O
no O
confidence O
and O
completely O
boycott O
the O
premier O
, O
or O
the O
premier O
could O
dissolve O
the O
parliament O
and O
appeal O
to O
a O
public O
referendum O
. O

Either O
case O
would O
spark O
a O
constitutional O
crisis O
. O

Alexander B-PERSON
Lu I-PERSON
agrees O
that O
a O
Chen B-PERSON
victory O
could O
lead O
to O
inter-branch O
conflict O
. O

But O
he O
does O
not O
see O
Taiwan B-GPE
independence O
as O
the O
main O
flashpoint O
. O

The O
critical O
issues O
will O
instead O
be O
those O
related O
to O
" O
black O
gold O
politics O
, O
" O
such O
as O
stock O
trading O
taxes O
, O
which O
directly O
affect O
the O
interests O
of O
certain O
legislators O
. O

Lu B-PERSON
explains O
: O
" O
Currently O
the B-ORG
Legislative I-ORG
Yuan I-ORG
is O
filled O
with O
representatives O
of O
capital O
. O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
laws O
that O
directly O
affect O
their O
personal O
privileges O
and O
interests O
, O
even O
the O
KMT B-ORG
is O
powerless O
to O
control O
them O
. O

Chen B-PERSON

has O
repeatedly O
emphasized O
that O
he O
intends O
to O
wipe O
out O

and O
will O
never O
compromise O

Inevitably O
, O
then O
, O
there O
will O
be O
a O

If O
Lien B-PERSON
Chan I-PERSON
is O
elected O
, O
the O
party O
- O
politics O
issues O
most O
deserving O
of O
attention O
will O
be O
whether O
this O
hastens O
the O
demise O
of O
the B-ORG
New I-ORG
Party I-ORG
and O
whether O
the O
KMT B-ORG
party O

the O

can O
move O

. O

Lien B-PERSON
is O
seen O
as O
Lee B-PERSON

designated O
successor O

But O
, O
given O
the O
term O
system O
for O
the O
chairmanship O
of O
the O
KMT B-ORG
, O
after O
the O
election O
there O
will O
be O
a O
period O
of O
time O
in O
which O
Lee B-PERSON
remains O
party O
chairman O
, O
while O
Lien B-PERSON
is O
president O
. O

In O
the O
past O
, O
state O
policy O
has O
always O
been O
decided O
by O
the O
party O
chairman O
. O

Observers O
are O
very O
curious O
about O
whether O
the O
KMT B-ORG
has O
in O
fact O
changed O
, O
or O
whether O
we O
will O
see O
a O
repeat O
of O
what O
happened O
back O
in O
the B-DATE
late I-DATE
1970s I-DATE
: O

At O
that O
time O
Yen B-PERSON
Chia I-PERSON

kan I-PERSON
was O
president O
, O
but O
national O
policy O
was O
in O
fact O
determined O
by O
Chiang B-PERSON
Ching I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
kuo I-PERSON
, O
whose O
authority O
derived O
from O
his O
post O
as O
party O
chairman O
and O
who O
took O
the O
position O
of O
premier O
from O
which O
to O
oversee O

day O
policy O

making O

As O
Li B-PERSON
Hsien I-PERSON

jen I-PERSON
analyzes O
the O
situation O
, O
if O
Lien B-PERSON
Chan I-PERSON
is O
elected O

there O
will O
indeed O
be O
a O
transition O
period O
in O
his O
relations O
with O
Lee B-PERSON
Teng I-PERSON

hui I-PERSON
. O

But O
this O
is O
not O
necessarily O
a O
bad O
thing O
for O
the O
KMT B-ORG
. O

Consider O
, O
says O
Li B-PERSON
, O
the O
fact O
that O
James B-ORG
Soong I-ORG
's I-ORG
candidacy O
has O
raised O
the O
specter O
of O
a O
party O
split O
. O

A O
victory O
for O
Lien B-PERSON
, O
with O
Lee B-PERSON
continuing O
as O
party O
chairman O
, O
would O
be O
helpful O
to O
the O
KMT B-ORG
in O
resolving O
internal O
party O
disputes O
, O
and O
in O
consolidating O
Lien B-PERSON
's O
party O
and O
government O
position O
. O

He O
says O
that O
it O
is O
unlikely O
that O
the O
Yen B-PERSON
- O
Chiang B-PERSON
situation O
would O
be O
repeated O
, O
since O
Lee B-PERSON
Teng I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
hui I-PERSON
will O
certainly O
not O
have O
an O
office O
like O
premier O
which O
would O
involve O
him O
in O
day O
- O
to O
- O
day O
policy O
- O
making O
. O

What O
would O
a O
Lien B-PERSON
victory O
mean O
for O
the B-ORG
New I-ORG
Party I-ORG
? O

Remember O
that O
the O
NP B-ORG
was O
organized O
primarily O
out O
of O
opposition O
to O
Lee B-PERSON
Teng I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
hui I-PERSON
. O

If O
Lien B-PERSON
Chan I-PERSON
can O
escape O
from O
Lee B-PERSON
's O
shadow O
, O
the B-ORG
New I-ORG
Party I-ORG
would O
lose O
its O
original O
purpose O
, O
and O
members O
could O
possibly O
return O
to O
the O
KMT B-ORG
, O
restoring O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
- O
party O
system O
that O
reigned O
before O
the O
NP B-ORG
was O
formed O
. O

Another O
significant O
possibility O
is O
that O
New B-ORG
Party I-ORG
members O
, O
who O
tend O
to O
support O
James B-PERSON
Soong I-PERSON
, O
could O
organize O
a O
brand O

new O
political O
party O
with O

after O

Soong B-PERSON

reiterated O
that O
he O
personally O
has O
no O
intention O
of O
organizing O
a O
new O
political O
party O
after O
the O

. O

But O
the O
political O
forces O
that O
support O
him O
will O
necessarily O
have O
to O
organize O
themselves O
in O
some O
fashion O
. O

Moreover O
, O
after O
Lee B-PERSON
Teng I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
hui I-PERSON
leaves O
the O
scene O
, O
and O
the O
NP B-ORG
no O
longer O
has O
that O
fixation O

the O
possibility O
of O
establishing O
a O
new O

with O

who O
by O
no O

If O
this O
happens O
, O
the B-ORG
New I-ORG
Party I-ORG
will O
no O
longer O
be O
in O
decline O
as O
it O
is O
now O
, O
but O
will O
re-emerge O
as O
a O
force O
to O
be O
reckoned O
with O

and O
Taiwan B-GPE
will O
be O
looking O
at O
a O
true O
three B-CARDINAL

party O
system O

If O
Lien B-PERSON

is O
elected O
, O
the O
KMT B-ORG
will O
continue O
to O
hold O
both O
executive O
power O

a O
legislative O
majority O
, O
and O
the O
premier O
will O
serve O
simply O
as O
the O
chief O
of O
staff O
to O
the O
president O
. O

However O
, O
based O
on O
current O
public O
opinion O
polls O
, O
it O
appears O
that O
whoever O
wins O
, O

included O
, O
will O
be O
only O
a O
" O
plurality O
president O
, O
" O
without O
a O
strong O
mandate O
to O
rule O
. O

To O
a O
certain O
degree O

then O
, O
he O
will O
have O

" O
Even O

in O

It O
will O
be O
virtually O
impossible O
for O

railroad O

the O

of O
a O

who O
does O

enjoy O

" O

The O
need O
for O

be O
further O

by O
the O
proposed O

This O

at O

reduce O
the O
financial O
leverage O
the O
KMT B-ORG
would O
have O
over O

could O
become O
even O
more O
difficult O
for O

face O
the O
problem O

If O

are O
people O
dissatisfied O
with O
the O

of O

It O
is O
generally O
believed O
that O
if O

, O
this O
could O
spark O
a O
dramatic O
reorganization O
of O

The O

fall O
on O
the B-ORG

which O

find O

made O
irrelevant O

with O
the O
KMT B-ORG

strongly O

If O

it O

Shao B-PERSON

even O

lead O
the O
way O
, O
his O
supporters O
- O
faced O
with O
the O
reality O
of O

At O
the O

according O
to O

an O
extremely O
high O
percentage O
of O

support O
Soong B-PERSON

If O

it O
would O
be O
logical O
for O

to O
leave O
the O
NP B-ORG

join O

: O
" O
As O
early O

is O
the O
closest O
of O
the O
three B-CARDINAL

thus O
putting O
the O

a O
dilemma O

The O
party O
nominated O

maintain O
the O

the O
NP B-ORG

still O
calls O
on O

but O
also O
says O
it O
will O
understand O
if O
its O

vote O
for O
another O

If O
Soong B-PERSON

, O
the O

also O
be O
thrown O

In O
this O

out O

been O
expelled O

the O

only O

One B-CARDINAL
of O
the O

is O
: O
" O
If O

For O

Tom B-PERSON

at O
NTUST B-PERSON
, O
describes O
the O
main O
difference O
between O
teaching O
adult O
executives O
and O
regular O
students O
: O

" O
Executives O
are O
always O
asking O
questions O
. O

Even O
when O
they O
have O
an O
idea O
themselves O
, O
they O
'll O
still O
bring O
up O
issues O
they O
encountered O
in O
their O

to O
see O
how O
you O
respond O
. O
" O

Often O
, O
says O
Lin B-PERSON
, O
such O
questions O
leave O
him O
stumped O
. O

Another O
issue O
for O
adult O
students O
always O
on O
the O
run O
is O
their O
unfamiliarity O
with O
the O

In O

from O
the O

which O

doors O

, O

programs O

, O

in O
Taiwan B-GPE
appears O
to O
be O
undergoing O
a O
sort O
of O
makeover O

With O
these O
changes O
, O
universities O
must O
not O
only O
take O
care O
of O
teaching O
and O
research O
, O
but O
must O
also O
make O
sure O
they O
play O
their O
third B-ORDINAL
function O
properly O
- O
spreading O
knowledge O
and O
sharing O
it O
with O
the O
public O
. O

Still O
, O
detractors O
point O
out O
that O
university O
graduate O
programs O
for O
business O
executives O
appear O
to O
be O
elitist O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
student O
attending O
a O
non-degree O
program O
at O
NTUST B-ORG
relates O
that O
there O
are O
not O
enough O
spots O
to O
go O
around O
in O
the O
executive O
degree O
programs O
. O

Hoping O
to O
make O
the O
switch O
from O
the O
non-degree O
program O
, O
he O
failed O
to O
pass O
the O
screening O
that O
is O
administered O
prior O
to O
the O
admissions O
test O
. O

" O
If O
you O
fail O
a O
test O
, O
you O
only O
have O
yourself O
to O
blame O
, O
but O
tripping O
up O
on O
the O
initial O
screening O
is O
just O
a O
matter O
of O
not O
having O
a O
high O
enough O
job O
title O
. O
" O

Each O
year O
when O
EMBA B-WORK_OF_ART
program O
acceptances O
are O
released O
, O
newspapers O
carry O
letters O
from O
readers O
relating O
how O
certain O
national O

schools O
compete O
to O
accept O
CEOs O

of O

, O

The O
NTUST B-ORG
student O
expresses O
cynicism O
toward O
the O
application O
and O
review O
process O
, O
suspecting O
that O
" O
they O
just O
pay O
attention O
to O
company O
name O
and O
job O
title O
. O
" O

Moreover O
, O
continuing O
education O
courses O
charge O
hefty O
tuition O
fees O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
NTU B-ORG
divides O
the O
school O
year O
into O
three B-CARDINAL
semesters O
, O
at O
NT$ O
50,000 B-MONEY
per O
semester O
, O
while O
other O
institutions O
charge O
between O
NT$ O
3700 B-MONEY
and O
$ O
10,000 B-MONEY
per O
credit O
, O
a O
full O
two B-CARDINAL
to O
three B-CARDINAL
times O
more O
than O
regular O
graduate O
student O
tuition O
. O

Such O
instances O
naturally O
lead O
to O
suspicion O
that O
graduate O
schools O
such O
as O
these O
are O
" O
out O
to O
make O
a O
killing O
" O
by O

only O

" O
From O

to O
ensure O

no O

is O
involved O
in O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL

of O
the O

Huang B-PERSON
admits O
that O
the O
bigger O
the O

higher O
the O
candidate O

, O
the O
greater O
their O
chances O
of O
acceptance O
into O
the O
program O
. O

This O
can O
be O
partially O
attributed O
to O
the O
belief O
among O
professors O
that O
the O
commitment O
of O
their O

yields O

The O

the O
cold O

does O
it O

This O

the O

The O
big O

had O
realized O
this O

adopted O
an O
oligarchic O
strategy O
: O
as O
well O
as O
making O
it O
difficult O
for O

they O
were O
very O

not O

But O
thanks O
to O
the O

the O
TCH B-ORG

had O
built O
up O
over O
many O

within O
the B-DATE

" O

But O
after O
going O

with O
TCH B-ORG
for O
several B-DATE

Dupont B-ORG
realized O
how O

the O

was O
, O
and O
since O
then O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
firms O
have O
begun O
to O
cooperate O

Currently O
, O
TCH B-ORG
is O
the O

fifth O

manufacturer O
of O
nylon O
66 B-CARDINAL

, O
supplying O
8 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT

It O
stands O
as O
another O
example O
of O
a O
Taiwanese B-NORP
company O
successfully O
taking O
on O
the O
big O
boys O
in O
international O
markets O
. O

The O
original O
use O
of O
nylon O
66 B-CARDINAL
was O
in O
tights O
and O
swimwear O
, O
but O
these O
are O
far O
from O
being O
the O
only O
applications O
for O
such O
a O
superior O
new O
fiber O
. O

But O
because O
the O
filaments O
are O
so O
thin O
-LRB- O
only O
half O
the O
thickness O
of O
a O
human O
hair O
-RRB- O
, O
they O
can O
easily O
break O
at O
the O
yarn O
spinning O
stage O
, O
and O
at O
the O
dyeing O
stage O
the O
yarn O
absorbs O
only O
the O
smallest O
dye O
molecules O
. O

Hence O
firms O
around O
the O
world O
are O
still O
feeling O
their O
way O
forward O
on O
how O
to O
use O
this O
fiber O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
TCH B-ORG
approached O
the O
CTI B-ORG
to O
conduct O
a O
series O
of O
cooperative O
development O
projects O
. O

To O
date O
they O
have O
successfully O
developed O
various O
new O
yarns O
blended O
from O
nylon O
66 B-CARDINAL
and O
other O
fibers O
such O
as O
acrylic O
or O
polyester O
, O
and O
have O
staged O
numerous O
seminars O
and O
visited O
many O

to O
teach O
users O
how O
to O
weave O
and O
dye O
the O
new O

and O
how O
to O
design O
for O
them O

Why O
go O
to O
such O
lengths O
to O
popularize O
new O
fibers O
? O

Grace B-PERSON
Kuo I-PERSON
says O
the O
textile O

today B-TIME
needs O
to O
take O
a O
lead O

constantly O

" O
What O

If O

you O
have O

Behind O

there O
needs O

a O

says O
, O
few O
manufacturers O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
were O
both O
interested O
in O
the O

competent O

it O
. O

Later O
, O
when O
his O
team O
had O
developed O
the O

, O
many O

expressed O
an O
interest O

But O
once O
they O
had O
acquired O
the O

many O
lost O

or O
even O
went O
out O

the O

were O
far O
from O

" O
At O
that O
time O
I O
felt O
very O
frustrated O

It O
was O
clearly O
a O
good O
process O
, O
but O
after O
buying O
the O

for O
a O

many O

On O
the O

the O

not O

For O
fear O
of O
putting O
all O

very O

This O

that O

Another O
type O
of O
new O

which O
is O
in O
great O

is O
wicking O
fabric O
, O
based O
on O

with O
a O
special O
cross-section O
. O

The O
leading O
volume O
producer O
of O
wicking O
fibers O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
is O
Chung B-ORG
Shing I-ORG
Textile I-ORG
Company I-ORG
. O

Its O
president O
, O
William B-PERSON
Shang I-PERSON
, O
explains O
that O
conventional O
fibers O
have O
a O
round O
cross-section O
, O
but O
by O
changing O
the O
fibers O
' O
physical O
properties O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
produce O
them O
with O
various O
cross-sectional O
profiles O
such O
as O
X O
or O
Y O
shapes O
, O
which O
create O
capillaries O
along O
the O
fibers O
. O

These O
not O
only O
quickly O
wick O
sweat O
away O
from O
the O
skin O
, O
but O
also O
regulate O
body O
temperature O
and O
allow O
garments O
to O
dry O
quickly O
after O
washing O
. O

However O
, O
the O
fibers O
' O
special O
properties O
can O
easily O
be O
destroyed O
in O
the O
various O
processes O
they O
go O
through O
such O
as O
yarn O
spinning O
, O
weaving O
, O
dyeing O
and O
finishing O
, O
so O
that O
making O
finished O
garments O
requires O
a O
high O
degree O
of O
technical O
sophistication O
. O

Chung B-PERSON
Shing I-PERSON
has O
launched O
a O
fabric O
named O
Coolplus B-PRODUCT
to O
compete O
with O

" O
Developing O
new O

is O
the O
most O
important O
element O
in O
upgrading O
the O
textile O
industry O
, O
" O
says O
Shang B-PERSON
. O

However O
, O
he O
acknowledges O
that O
although O
many O
new O
products O
are O
being O
developed O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
on O
closer O
inspection O
they O
are O
all O
copies O
of O

first B-ORDINAL
developed O
elsewhere O
, O
and O
so O
fall O
some O
way O
short O
of O
real O
innovation O
. O

But O
whereas O
it O
used O
to O
take O
Taiwanese B-NORP
companies O
several B-DATE
years I-DATE
of O
trial O
and O
error O
to O
figure O
out O
how O

such O

, O
the O
gap O
between O
them O
and O
their O
European B-NORP
and O
American B-NORP
competitors O
is O
growing O
ever O
smaller O
. O

When O

it O
now O
only O
takes O

two B-DATE
to I-DATE
three I-DATE

to O
bring O
out O
an O

. O

William B-PERSON
Shang I-PERSON
observes O
that O
when O
most O
Taiwanese B-NORP
firms O
see O
something O
new O
at O
an O
overseas O
exhibition O
they O
will O
bring O
back O
a O
sample O
, O
inspect O
it O
under O
a O
high O
- O
powered O
microscope O
to O
determine O
the O
weaving O
method O
and O
have O
it O
chemically O
analyzed O
to O
find O
out O
the O
composition O
of O
the O
fibers O
and O
finishing O
chemicals O
. O

With O
Taiwan B-GPE
's O
long O
years B-DATE
of O
manufacturing O
experience O
, O
it O
is O
then O
not O
difficult O
to O
reproduce O
the O

with O

. O

However O
, O
Shang B-PERSON
does O
not O
see O
this O
as O
a O
viable O
long O
- O
term O
strategy O
. O

" O
The O
best O
strategy O
for O
the O
long O
- O
term O
is O
still O
to O
put O
more O
effort O
into O
basic O
scientific O
research O
, O
" O
he O
says O
. O

For O
example O
, O
he O
read O
in O
Time B-ORG
magazine I-ORG
that O
because O
spiders O
produce O
the O
best O
natural O
fibers O
in O
the O
world O
, O
being O
both O
lustrous O
and O
resilient O
, O
US B-GPE
scientists O
transferred O
spider O
genes O
into O
silkworms O
to O
produce O
" O
super O
silkworms O
. O
" O

The O
technique O
succeeded O
, O
but O
because O
the O
Americans B-NORP
were O
not O
very O
interested O
in O
producing O
clothing O
textiles O
, O
they O
did O
not O
commercialize O
it O
. O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
this O
kind O
of O
combination O
of O
lateral O
thinking O
and O
advanced O
technology O
, O
Taiwan B-GPE
still O
has O
some O
way O
to O
go O
. O

Shang B-PERSON
, O
currently O
chairman O

the O
CTI B-ORG

, O
is O
well O
aware O
of O
where O
the O
obstacle O
to O
R&D O
lies O
: O
" O
Innovative O
ideas O
take O
time O
to O
mature O
, O
and O
you O
have O
to O
accept O
a O
high O
degree O
of O
uncertainty O
. O

But O
our O
environment O
does O
not O
allow O
this O
. O
" O

He O
notes O
that O
industries O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
always O
pursue O
short O

, O
so O
there O
is O
never O
much O

which O
are O
too O
forward O

looking O
and O
can O
not O
immediately O
produce O

this O

moved O

Finally O
he O

Taiwan B-GPE
is O
the O
world O

made O

but O
it O
only O
produces O
a O

range O
of O

- O
market O
fibers O
for O

, O
to O
the O
almost O

other O
high O

Again O

when O

Taiwan B-GPE

export O
item O
, O
finished O

, O
these O

are O
largely O

For O

, O
Taiwan B-GPE
has O
been O
struck O

, O
and O
requires O

. O

The O
currently O
planned O
high O

alone O
is O
expected O
to O
require O
several B-QUANTITY

But O
Taiwanese B-NORP
companies O
are O
inexperienced O
in O
this O

, O
and O
sending O
products O
overseas O
for O
quality O

is O
time O

complicated O
, O
so O
local O

can O
only O
stand O

A O
decade B-DATE
or O
so O

, O
while O
he O
was O
studying O
in O
Australia B-GPE
, O
he O
developed O
an O
interest O
in O

, O
and O
hoped O
to O
develop O
the O
use O
of O

Later O
he O
learned O
that O
stainless O

have O
an O
enormously O
wide O
range O
of O
applications O
in O
the O
textiles O

But O
he O
could O
not O

Rocky B-PERSON
Chang I-PERSON
says O
that O
before O
King B-ORG

started O
producing O
metal O
fibers O
, O
the O
market O
was O
divided O
up O
between O
a O
few O
foreign O
companies O
which O
charged O
high O
prices O
and O
produced O
only O
small O
quantities O
of O
products O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
when O
Taiwanese B-NORP
users O
had O
difficulties O
with O
production O
they O
did O
not O
know O
who O
to O
turn O
to O

Looking O

the O

, O
Chang B-PERSON
hopes O
that O

For O

Unlike O
those O
working O
with O
other O
forms O
of O

, O
the O
creators O
of O

need O

even O

It O
turns O
out O
that O
these B-DATE

eight I-DATE

a O

In O
1996 B-DATE

the O
OECD B-ORG
coined O
the O

" O

but O
what O
is O
it O
really O
? O

How O
can O
such O

Because O
each O

there O
are O

Wu B-PERSON

out O
that O
the O

It O
is O

how O

the O

what O

The O

this B-DATE

the O

Taiwan B-GPE
currently O
ranks O
fourth B-ORDINAL
in O
the O

in O
value O
of O

, O

In O

whose O

has O
become O
a O
much O

coveted O
new O
entry O
in O

has O
drawn O
international O
attention O
with O

" O
Talented O

at O
the O
root O
of O

" O

AV O
software O
is O
very O
difficult O
to O
produce O
, O
and O

must O
have O
a O
solid O

. O

This O
is O
where O
Taiwan B-GPE
is O
at O
an O
advantage O
. O

However O
, O
though O
Taiwan B-GPE
has O
its O
strong O
points O
, O
there O
are O
also O
a O
number O
of O
problems O
and O
shortcomings O
. O

" O
The O
first B-ORDINAL
thing O
to O
consider O
, O
says O
Wu B-PERSON
Se-hwa I-PERSON
, O
" O
is O
this O
: O

What O
kind O
of O
knowledge O
- O
based O
economy O
is O
Taiwan B-GPE
most O
suited O
to O
? O
" O

Wu B-PERSON
says O
that O
right O
now O
what O
the O
government O
is O
focusing O
on O
and O
what O
stock O
market O
players O
most O
hope O
for O
is O
a O
US B-GPE
- O
style O
" O
new O
economy O
. O
" O

The O
focus O
is O
on O
new O
industries O
, O
such O
as O
software O
and O
the O
Internet O
, O
or O
communications O
technology O
, O
fiber O
- O
optics O
, O
biotechnology O
, O
and O
the O
like O
. O

But O
can O
the O
American B-NORP
model O
be O
reproduced O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
? O

There O
is O
little O
reason O
to O
be O
optimistic O
. O

The O
new O
economy O
in O
the O
US B-GPE
depends O
heavily O
, O
for O
one O
thing O
, O
on O
a O
deep O
foundation O
of O
basic O
scientific O
research O
, O
which O
comes O
up O
with O
revolutionary O
products O
like O
genetically O
modified O
foods O
. O

Another O
key O
factor O
is O
that O
the O
US B-GPE
has O
a O
mechanism O
for O
innovation O
and O
entrepreneurship O
, O
so O
that O
new O
ideas O
have O
a O
chance O
to O
be O
brought O
into O
play O
. O

The O
rapid O
growth O
in O
the O
new O
economy O
has O
driven O
a O
decade O
- O
long O
economic O
boom O
in O
the O
States B-GPE
. O

The O
old O
manufacturing O
economy O
has O
naturally O
been O
trimmed O
back O
, O
with O
factories O
relocating O
overseas O
, O
but O
American B-NORP
firms O
can O
depend O
on O
the O
rights O
to O
technology O
to O
earn O
a O
profit O
. O

This O
is O
a O
classic O
" O
knowledge O
goose O
that O
lays O
golden O
eggs O
. O
" O

The O
new O

is O
a O
weapon O
by O
which O
the O
US B-GPE
dominates O
the O
world O
, O
with O
" O
the O
export O

In O

only O

Of O
these O

four B-CARDINAL

it O
earns O
enough O
each O

balance O
its O
enormous O

In O

Taiwan B-GPE

a O

with O

going O
out O
twice O
as O

as O
it O

The O
impressive O

certainly O
be O
difficult O

apply O
to O
the O

says O
Wu B-PERSON
Se-hwa I-PERSON
, O
" O
the O

closer O
to O

" O

As O
Wu B-PERSON
explains O
, O
the O
OECD B-ORG
definition O
of O
the O

economy O
embraces O
all O
kinds O
of O
industries O

from O

Any O

, O
using O
knowledge O
to O
improve O
management O
, O
innovate O
, O
or O
improve O
quality O
, O
can O
be O
considered O
a O
knowledge O
industry O
. O

This O
is O
a O
much O
more O
practical O
ambition O
for O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
which O
has O
a O
high O
proportion O
of O
traditional O
industry O
and O
is O
extremely O

to O
make O

In O

more B-CARDINAL

4500 I-CARDINAL

in O
the O
US B-GPE
, O
ranking O
fourth O
. O

But O
not O
many O

mainly O
ways O

in O
the O

Innovations O
that O

require O
less O

not O
require O

and O
which O
is O
even O
threatening O
the O

position O
of O
Intel B-ORG
, O
has O
adopted O
a O
different O
strategy O
for O
gradually O
expanding O

territory O
. O

William B-PERSON
Lee I-PERSON
, O
who O
works O
in O
public O
relations O
at O
VIA B-ORG
, O
says O
that O
the O
production O
of O
chipsets O
is O
a O
high O
risk O
activity O
. O

So O
, O
taking O
advantage O
of O
the O
boom O
in O
the O
Taiwan B-GPE
stock O
market O
over O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
two I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
the O
company O
went O
on O
a O
binge O
of O
hiring O
, O
acquisitions O
, O
and O
strategic O
alliances O
, O
expanding O
in O
size O
rapidly O
. O

Lee B-PERSON
says O
that O
in O
the O
past O
, O
VIA B-ORG
's O
chipsets O
were O
designed O
completely O
to O
support O
Intel B-ORG
specification O
CPUs O
. O

In O
1998 B-DATE
, O
when O
Intel B-ORG
insisted O
on O
sticking O
with O
expensive O
Rambus B-ORG
memory O
chips O
despite O
a O
poor O
market O
response O
, O
VIA B-ORG
saw O
its O
opportunity O
: O

It O
began O
promoting O
use O
of O
the B-PRODUCT
P133 I-PRODUCT
memory I-PRODUCT
chip I-PRODUCT
, O
which O
had O
been O
created O
by O
an O
international O
consortium O
and O
was O
provided O
to O
factories O
free O
of O
charge O
. O

For O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
, O
VIA B-ORG
had O
challenged O
the O
" O
big O
boss O
, O
" O
Intel B-ORG
. O

In O
the B-DATE
latter I-DATE
half I-DATE
of I-DATE
1999 I-DATE
, O
VIA B-ORG
acquired O
two B-CARDINAL
CPU O
companies O
in O
the O
States B-GPE
, O
giving O
it O
an O
independent O
ability O
to O
develop O
CPUs O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
half B-DATE
a I-DATE
year I-DATE

it O
entered O
into O
cooperation O
with O
the O
US B-GPE
graphics O
powerhouse O
S3 O
to O
make O

chips O
. O

In O
these O
ways O
, O
VIA B-ORG
is O
moving O
step O
by O
step O
to O
enlarge O
its O
intellectual O
holdings O
. O

" O
You O
have O
to O
have O
a O

of O

already O
on O

before O
you O
can O
start O
talking O
about O
systematic O
integration O
and O
trying O
out O
major O
innovations O
, O
" O
says O
Lee B-PERSON
. O

It O
is O
only O
now O
that O
VIA B-ORG
can O
escape O
from O
the O
specifications O
dictated O
by O
large O
multinational O
firms O
, O
and O
create O
innovative O
products O
of O
its O
own O
. O

To O
meet O
future O
market O
demand O
for O
home O
appliances O
that O
are O
inexpensive O
, O
multi-functional O
, O
and O
portable O
, O
the O
main O
direction O
will O
be O
to O
get O
all O
the O
functions O
on O
to O
a O
single O
chip O
. O

VIA B-ORG
has O
designed O
a O
new O
3 B-CARDINAL
- O
in O
- O
1 B-CARDINAL
chipset O
which O
includes O
CPU O
, O
memory O
, O
and O
graphics O
, O
which O
are O
expected O
to O
formally O
hit O
the O
market O
in O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
half I-DATE
of I-DATE
2001 I-DATE
. O

As O
Lee B-PERSON
reveals O
: O
" O
No O
one O
has O
ever O
done O
this O
before O
. O

We O
are O
trying O
something O
new O
. O
" O

Save O
the O
idiots O
! O

Nonetheless O
, O
knowledge O
and O
creativity O
are O
intangible O
, O
and O
it O
is O
not O
always O
easy O
to O
determine O
ownership O
. O

This O
is O
especially O
problematic O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
where O
some O
people O
still O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
very O
clear O
idea O
about O
intellectual O
property O
rights O
, O
and O
legal O
protections O
are O
less O
than O
comprehensive O
. O

This O
is O
a O
potential O
problem O
for O
the O
development O
of O
the O
knowledge O
- O
based O
economy O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
. O

" O
Many O
innovations O
just O
represent O
going O
a O
little O
bit O
further O
in O
thinking O
about O
a O
problem O
than O
the O
other O
guys O
, O
and O
once O
the O
secret O
is O
uncovered O
, O
it O
is O
easy O
for O
them O
to O
copy O
the O
idea O
, O
" O
says O
Simon B-PERSON
Chang I-PERSON
. O

The O
most O
famous O
example O
in O
the O
industry O
involves O
a O
certain O
company O
that O
wanted O
to O
create O
information O
systems O
like O
storage O
and O
document O
handling O
. O

It O
invited O
a O
number O
of O
information O
industry O
firms O
to O
give O
briefings O
on O
their O
products O
. O

After O
a O
while O
, O
this O
former O
" O
outsider O
" O
became O
an O
insider O
, O
and O
created O
its O
own O
product O
, O
congratulating O
itself O
on O
saving O
so O
much O
money O
in O
the O
process O
. O

Simon B-PERSON
Chang I-PERSON
notes O
that O
a O
major O
innovation O
usually O
is O
nested O
in O
a O
lot O
of O
small O
innovations O
. O

If O
small O
innovations O
are O
not O
recognized O
, O
or O
do O
not O
get O
appropriate O
market O
rewards O
, O
this O
will O
destroy O
the O
motivation O
to O
innovate O
at O
all O
. O

This O
is O
precisely O
the O
problem O
now O
being O
faced O
by O
Comdek B-ORG
, O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
company O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
to O
produce O
medical O
instruments O
such O
as O
blood O
- O
oxygen O
monitors O
and O
ear O
thermometers O
. O

Michael B-PERSON
Y.S. I-PERSON
Kuo I-PERSON
, O
general O
manager O
at O
Comdek B-ORG
, O
points O
out O
that O
the O
quick O
and O
easy O
process O
of O
taking O
body O
temperature O
through O
the O
ear O
was O
developed O
by O
an O
American B-NORP
company O
, O
and O
the O
German B-NORP
giant O
Boehringer-Ingelheim B-ORG
paid O
a O
huge O
amount O
of O
money O
for O
the O
patent O
so O
they O
could O
begin O
production O
. O

Comdek B-ORG
took O
the O
basic O
principle O
, O
and O
went O
to O
work O
on O
it O
, O
eventually O
coming O
up O
with O
their O
own O
version O
, O
for O
which O
they O
have O
been O
awarded O
a O
patent O
. O

But O
when O
Comdek B-ORG
's O
product O
came O
out O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
Kuo I-PERSON
still O
found O
himself O
in O
a O
vicious O
struggle O
with O
Taiwan B-GPE
pirate O
firms O
: O
" O
It O
's O
equivalent O
to O
making O
fools O
out O
of O
those O
of O
us O
who O
invest O
the O
money O
to O
do O
research O
and O
development O
! O
" O

Kuo B-PERSON
says O
that O
while O
there O
has O
been O
some O
improvement O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
with O
regard O
to O
protection O
of O
intellectual O
property O
rights O
, O
there O
is O
still O
not O
enough O
for O
those O
who O
invest O
in O
development O
and O
innovation O
. O

Comdek B-ORG
has O
closed O
its O
laboratory O
and O
production O
line O
to O
any O
outside O
visits O
, O
and O
has O
not O
ruled O
out O
the O
possibility O
of O
moving O
its O
lab O
overseas O
to O
get O
away O
from O
industrial O
espionage O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
. O

Looking O
for O
a O
Taiwan B-GPE
McDonald B-ORG
's O

Espionage O
reflects O
a O
lack O
of O
respect O
for O
knowledge O
. O

But O
there O
is O
also O
the O
problem O
of O
insufficient O
awareness O
of O
the O
potential O
value O
of O
knowledge O
, O
so O
that O
, O
as O
Wu B-PERSON
Se-hwa I-PERSON
says O
, O
Taiwan B-GPE
firms O
" O
are O
sitting O
on O
a O
mountain O
of O
gold O
, O
but O
do O
n't O
know O
that O
they O
can O
sell O
what O
they O
know O
for O
hard O
cash O
. O
" O

" O
The O
most O
' O
classic O
' O
form O
of O
knowledge O
product O
is O
one O
in O
which O
the O
intangible O
value O
of O
the O
knowledge O
transcends O
the O
tangible O
value O
of O
the O
product O
, O
and O
can O
be O
reproduced O
in O
large O
volume O
at O
low O
cost O
, O
thus O
earning O
huge O
profits O
. O
" O

Wu B-PERSON
points O
to O
the O
US B-GPE
coffee O
shop O
chain O
Starbucks B-ORG

Can O
they O
really O

huge O
profits O
just O
by O
selling O
cups O
of O

for O
a O
couple O
of O
bucks O

What O

" O
the O
knowledge O

how O
to O
run O

" O

The O

when O

powerful O

, O
and O
high O

the O
result O
has O
swept O

Now O
over B-CARDINAL

now O
that O

" O
says O

: O

, O
Taiwan B-GPE

the O
knack O
for O

and O
even O
industries O
like O
eel O

have O
their O
own O
technologies O

but O
people O
only O
think O
about O
keeping O
these O

making O

do O

them O
! O

Of O
course O

this O

such O

Unlike O

there O

no O

Everything O
seemed O
smooth O

But O
the O

primary O
concern O
was O
whether O

the O

be O

Concern O

that O

of O
the B-ORG

of O

, O
points O
out O
that O
during O
their O
four B-DATE
centuries I-DATE
in O
Macau B-GPE
the O
Portuguese B-NORP
never O
attempted O
to O
build O
up O
the O
Portuguese B-LANGUAGE
language O
ability O
of O
the O
local O
people O
. O

Few O
Chinese B-NORP
have O
ever O
mastered O
Portuguese B-LANGUAGE
, O
and O
there O
are O
not O
many O
people O
who O
understand O
both O
Western O
law O
and O
the O
Chinese B-LANGUAGE
language O
. O

This O
presents O
enormous O
difficulties O
for O
the O
localization O
into O
Chinese B-LANGUAGE
of O
Macau B-GPE
's O
mass O
of O
colonial O
era O
laws O
. O

Due O
to O
the O
chronic O
dearth O
of O
qualified O
personnel O
among O
Macau B-GPE
's O
judiciary O
, O
much O
of O
the O
work O
of O
legal O
localization O
depends O
on O
experts O
from O
the O
mainland O
. O

But O
according O
to O
Gary B-PERSON
Mei I-PERSON
, O
" O
The O
socialist B-NORP
law O
that O
they O
are O
used O
to O
on O
the O
mainland O
is O
out O
of O
synch O
with O
the O
capitalist O

type O
law O
of O
Macau B-GPE
, O
in O
terms O
both O
of O
attitude O

" O

But O
legal O
professionals O
who O
have O
studied O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
where O
legal O
concepts O
are O
closer O
to O
those O
that O
hold O
in O

, O
can O
play O
an O

As O

this O

if O

none O
of O
the O

would O
want O
to O
actively O
" O
align O
" O
themselves O
with O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
given O
the O
pro-Beijing O
political O
climate O
in O
Macau B-GPE

" O
Which O
is O

" O

Friendly O

On O
the O

not O

in O

as O
they O

all O

Macau B-GPE

" O

" O

You O
bump O

you O
only O

" O
Unlike O

Although O
pro-Beijing O
elements O
prevail O
in O
Macau B-GPE
, O
the O
former O
Portuguese B-NORP
administration O
did O
n't O
seem O
too O
bothered O
about O
PRC B-ORG
pressure O
when O
it O
came O
to O
the O
issue O
of O
ties O
with O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
perhaps O
because O
their O
only O
concern O
was O
for O
people O

livelihood O
. O

Visa O
- O
free O
entry O
to O
Macau B-GPE
for O
Taiwanese B-NORP
is O
a O
case O

Explains O

: O
" O
Macau B-GPE
offers O

free O
access O
to O
residents O
of O
over O
40 B-CARDINAL
countries O
with O
which O
it O

place O
for O
which O
it O
provides O
visa O
- O
free O
access O
without O
there O
being O
diplomatic O

" O

Moreover O
, O
Taiwanese B-NORP
officials O
have O
always O
had O
an O
easier O
time O
going O
in O
and O
out O
of O
Macau B-GPE
, O
compared O
with O
the O
fuss O
involved O
in O
getting O

have O
been O
admitted O

their O
way O

the O

cross O
into O

Taiwanese B-NORP
businesspeople O
in O
Macau B-GPE
form O
another O
group O
that O
is O
usually O

is O
a O
typical O
example O

Chen B-PERSON
arrived O
in O
Macau B-GPE
ten B-DATE
years I-DATE

, O
and O
ran O
air O

tours O
by O
light O

until O
the O

international O
airport O
opened O

after O
which O
he O
moved O
into O
the O
liquor O

When O
he O
travels O
to O
the O
mainland O
he O
takes O
his O
Macau B-GPE
Resident O

Permit O
, O
but O
when O
he O
comes O
back O
to O
Taiwan B-GPE
he O
uses O
his O
ROC O
passport O
. O

As O
part O
of O
his O
efforts O
to O
attract O
more O
Taiwanese B-NORP
investors O
to O
do O
business O
in O
Macau B-GPE
, O
he O
helped O
introduce O
President O

Kao B-PERSON

to O
the O
territory O
, O
and O
in O
order O
to O
build O
better O
ties O
with O
the O
mainland O
Chinese B-NORP
, O
he O
helped O
the B-ORG
Xinhua I-ORG
News I-ORG
Agency I-ORG
in O
Macau B-GPE
to O
install O
satellite O
TV O
. O

But O
when O
he O
found O
that O
his O
elementary O

school O

age O
grandson O
was O
speaking O
Cantonese B-LANGUAGE
all O
day O
he O
quickly O
sent O
him O
back O
to O
school O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
fearing O
that O
the O
boy O
was O
losing O
his O
mother O
tongue O
. O

A O
consensus O
among O
the O
Taiwanese B-NORP
living O
and O
working O
in O
Macau B-GPE
is O
that O
" O
you O
ca O
n't O
use O
ideology O
to O
decide O
what O
's O
right O
and O
wrong O
. O
" O

Another O
point O
they O
agree O
on O
is O
that O
not O
enough O
was O
done O
in O
the O
past O
to O
develop O
ties O
between O
Taiwan B-GPE

Macau B-GPE

that O
with O
Macau B-GPE

change O

the O

change O

" O
Taiwanese B-NORP

" O

Chen B-PERSON

that O

As O

" O
Because O

the O

Unlike O
the O

As O

the O

nothing O

but O
400 B-DATE

, O
the O
people O
of O
Macau B-GPE
intertwined O
cultures O
from O

far O

as O

Their O

be O

everywhere O

Intellectual O
assets O

In O
the O
enclave O

restaurants O
, O
such O
classic O
Macanese B-NORP
dishes O
as O
curry O
and O
Portuguese B-NORP
chicken O
are O
served O
up O
with O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
seasonings O
, O
blending O
the O

of O
Cantonese B-NORP
dishes O
with O
the O
rich O
, O
tangy O
taste O
of O
old-style O

One B-CARDINAL
example O
is O
Macanese B-NORP

a O
combination O
of O

sausage O

- O
not O

Portuguese B-NORP

either O
. O

The O
exteriors O
of O
traditional O
Macau B-GPE

are O
noticeably O
southern B-NORP
European I-NORP
in O
style O

But O
Marreiros B-PERSON
, O
an O
architect O
, O
points O
out O
that O
while O
the O
outsides O
of O
many O
houses O
are O
European B-NORP
, O
the O
arrangement O
of O
rooms O
and O
furniture O
inside O
is O
often O
done O
in O
a O
Chinese B-NORP
manner O
. O

" O
The O
important O
space O
is O
given O
to O
the O
father O
and O
the O
eldest O
son O
. O

The O
remaining O
side O
rooms O
are O
for O
the O
ladies O
of O
the O
house O
and O
others O
- O
quite O
different O
from O
Portuguese B-NORP
architecture O
, O
" O
he O
says O
. O

And O
the O
details O
of O

, O
such O

are O
actually O
