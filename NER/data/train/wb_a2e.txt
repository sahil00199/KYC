Saudi I-GPE
Arabia I-GPE
is O

its O
production O

in O
case O
the O

causes O
a O
reduction O
of O
the O

production O
or O
a O
rise O
in O
prices O
? O

In O

words O
, O
is O
the B-GPE
Kingdom I-GPE
of I-GPE
Saudi I-GPE
Arabia I-GPE
ready O
to O
use O
the O
oil O
weapon O
against O
the O

weapon O
? O

I O
would O
also O
like O
to O
ask O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
Iranian B-NORP
crisis O
, O
what O
is O
the O
significance O
of O
the O
initiatives O
that O
the O

, O
of O
which O
the B-GPE

in O

Is O
this O
, O
I O

, O
the O
preparation O
a O
group O
of O
Sunni B-NORP
Arab B-NORP
countries O
are O
undertaking O
as O
a O
warning O

leadership O
? O

Your O
Highness O
, O
the B-PERSON
Minister I-PERSON
: O
We O
are O
-LSB- O
handling O
-RSB- O
the O
issue O
of O
facing O
the O
oil O
weapon O
with O
the O
oil O
weapon O
, O
because O
we O
do O
not O
consider O
it O
an O
oil O
weapon O
. O

It O
is O
wealth O
to O
be O
used O
, O
and O
we O
are O
using O
this O
wealth O
in O
consideration O
of O
our O
national O
interests O
, O
the O
interests O
of O
the O
producing O
nations O
, O
and O
the O
interests O
of O
the O
consuming O
nations O
. O

His O
Highness O
the B-PERSON
Oil I-PERSON
Minister I-PERSON
has O
very O
clearly O
clarified O
that O
the O
policy O
of O
the O
Kingdom B-GPE
is O
established O
on O
balance O
in O
the O
oil O
market O
. O

The O
Kingdom B-GPE
has O
historically O
proven O
that O
in O
times O
of O
crisis O
, O
it O
does O
what O
it O
should O
do O
as O
the O
biggest O
producer O
of O
oil O
, O
in O
a O
way O
that O
guarantees O
the O
stability O
of O
the O
oil O
markets O
. O

As O
for O
the O
nuclear O
program O
which O
the B-ORG
Gulf I-ORG
Cooperation I-ORG
Council I-ORG
has O
approved O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
among O
the O
most O
important O
reasons O
on O
which O
the O
Council B-ORG
agreed O
in O
this O
framework O
is O
to O
enter O
in O
this O
important O
industry O
, O
the O
importance O
of O
which O
not O
only O
includes O
a O
military O
aspect O
, O
but O
also O
a O
peaceful O
aspect O
, O
in O
order O
to O
establish O
an O
industry O
subject O
to O
strict O
controls O
that O
can O
not O
be O
violated O
, O
in O
order O
to O
guarantee O
its O
peaceful O
direction O
. O

And O
it O
may O
be O
an O
example O
for O
all O
who O
want O
to O
have O
this O
industry O
and O
have O
no O
intention O
of O
developing O
it O
, O
other O
than O
establishing O
nuclear O
weapons O

This O
is O
the O

No O

the O
political O
reading O
today O
differs O
from O
the O
situations O
in O
which O
the O
decision O
was O
made O
at O
that O
time O

The O
political O
situation O
of O
the O
world O
today O
has O
even O
become O
more O
complicated O
than O
before O
. O

It O
ca O
n't O
be O
said O
that O
any O
oil O
producing O
country O
can O
use O
oil O
as O
a O
weapon O
to O
impose O
a O
certain O
political O
vision O
or O
political O

It O
may O
be O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
reasons O
that O
the O
American B-NORP
presence O
in O

In O
the O

of O
the O

by O

for I-ORG
the I-ORG
Defense I-ORG

Arabian I-ORG

what O
facilitates O
the O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
system O
's O
abuses O
of O
human O

is O
the O
set O
of O
governmental O
administrative O
regulations O
that O
are O
not O
based O
on O
justice O
and O
equality O
, O
and O
which O
are O
a O
part O
of O
the O
state O
structure O
that O
is O
far O
removed O
from O
legal O
accountability O
, O
be O
it O
to O
independent O
international O
organizations O
or O
local O
civil O
groups O
. O

This O
is O
what O
makes O
the O
system O
act O
arbitrarily O
. O

The O
2006 B-DATE
report O
on O
human O
rights O
abuses O
in O
the B-LOC
Arabian I-LOC
Peninsula I-LOC
prepared O
by O
the O
committee O
, O
criticized O
the O
Kingdom B-GPE
's O
lack O
of O
a O
constitution O
regulating O
the O
course O
of O
the O
country O
, O
stating O
that O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
regime O
missed O
a O
fundamental O
element O
on O
which O
any O
political O
system O
is O
based O
. O

This O
element O
is O
the O
constitution O
which O
regulates O
the O
course O
of O
the O
country O
and O
the O
rights O
of O
the O
ruler O
and O
the O
ruled O
at O
various O
levels O
. O

Thus O
far O
, O
there O
is O
no O
written O
constitution O
for O
the O
country O
. O

It O
added O
that O
Saudi B-NORP
laws O
are O
not O
written O
down O
and O
are O
obscure O
, O
and O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
government O
's O
basic O
law O
deals O
with O
some O
of O
the O
main O
legal O
issues O
, O
nevertheless O
it O
is O
not O
a O
constitution O
. O

The O
report O
also O
criticized O
the O
Kingdom B-GPE
's O
legal O
system O
, O
pointing O
out O
that O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Judicial I-ORG
Council I-ORG
appoints O
judges O
, O
posts O
them O
and O
dismisses O
them O
, O
and O
that O
the B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
of I-ORG
Justice I-ORG
also O
holds O
judges O
accountable O
. O

It O
deemed O
that O
the O
judges O
are O
not O
independent O
and O
are O
subject O
to O
pressures O
from O
senior O
members O
of O
the O
ruling O
family O
and O
from O
senior O
government O
officials O
to O
influence O
their O
decisions O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
members O
of O
the O
public O
and O
members O
of O
the O
royal O
family O
are O
not O
actually O
equal O
before O
the O
judicial O
system O
. O

In O
its O
opinion O
the O
government O
has O
continued O
to O
commit O
serious O
violations O
. O

The O
restrictions O
imposed O
on O
the O
media O
and O
the O
internet O
have O
also O
continued O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
repression O
of O
minorities O
, O
especially O
of O
the O
Shia B-NORP
and O
the O
Ismailis B-NORP
. O

The O
government O
has O
continued O
to O
ignore O
the O
wish O
of O
the O
people O
for O
a O
responsible O
government O
which O
can O
be O
held O
accountable O
and O
questioned O
. O

It O
accused O
the O
Kingdom B-GPE
of O
using O
the O
law O
as O
a O
repressive O
political O
weapon O
or O
tool O
against O
the O
society O
at O
a O
time O
when O
the O
aim O
of O
the O
law O
is O
to O
protect O
the O
individual O
's O
human O
rights O
from O
the O
power O
of O
the O
state O
. O

In O
its O
opinion O
, O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
criminal O
justice O
system O
facilitates O
detainees O
being O
exposed O
to O
harm O
during O
the O
period O
they O
are O
in O
custody O
and O
under O
investigation O
, O
the O
reason O
for O
this O
being O
the O
lack O
of O
judicial O
supervision O
. O

What O
makes O
the O
abuses O
increasingly O
grave O
is O
that O
the O
main O
arresting O
authorities O
, O
these O
being O
the O
public O
security O
forces O
, O
the O
public O
investigation O
forces O
and O
the O
religious O
police O
, O
do O
not O
fall O
under O
any O
judicial O
supervision O
. O

The O
report O
stressed O
that O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
most O
important O
loopholes O
in O
the O
basic O
governing O
system O
is O
its O
failure O
to O
recognize O
the O
right O
to O
the O
freedom O
of O
expression O
and O
belief O
, O
and O
pointed O
out O
that O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
government O
does O
not O
allow O
political O
parties O
and O
puts O
stringent O
restrictions O
on O
the O
freedom O
of O
expression O
. O

It O
brought O
to O
attention O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
number O
of O
citizens O
banned O
from O
traveling O
abroad O
for O
political O
reasons O
has O
exceeded O
14 B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
. O

It O
added O
that O
reports O
estimate O
an B-CARDINAL
approximate I-CARDINAL
6 I-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
Shiite B-NORP
citizens O
from O
the B-LOC
Eastern I-LOC
Region I-LOC
, O
Medina B-GPE
and O
Najran B-GPE
are O
banned O
from O
leaving O
the O
country O
. O

Passports O
are O
being O
confiscated O
without O
a O
court O
order O
and O
there O
are O
many O
reasons O
for O
confiscation O
- O
from O
traveling O
to O
Iran B-GPE
to O
other O
unknown O
reasons O
. O

The O
report O
indicated O
that O
the O
basic O
governance O
system O
does O
not O
recognize O
the O
right O
to O
peaceful O
assembly O
, O
considering O
that O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
regime O
puts O
all O
kinds O
of O
difficulties O
in O
the O
way O
of O
the O
religious O
, O
cultural O
and O
educational O
activities O
of O
the O
Shiites B-NORP
in O
the O
Kingdom B-GPE
. O

The O
report O
accused O
the O
Saudi B-GPE
regime O
of O
banning O
Shiites B-NORP
from O
job O
opportunities O
in O
administration O
of O
public O
schools O
, O
adding O
that O
the O
government O
bans O
teaching O
any O
religious O
books O
in O
schools O
and O
universities O
that O
are O
not O
Hanabali B-NORP
and O
does O
not O
present O
any O
Shafii B-NORP
, O
Maliki B-NORP
or O
Shiite B-NORP
opinions O
as O
part O
of O
religious O
instruction O
. O

It O
does O
not O
allow O
non-Hanabali B-NORP
clerics O
to O
teach O
their O
doctorines O
. O

It O
pointed O
out O
that O
the O
government O
controls O
religious O
education O
and O
the O
public O
and O
private O
schools O
from O
basic O
through O
to O
the O

How O

we O

in O

Iran B-GPE

Iranian B-NORP
politicians O
were O
to O
many O

an O
example O
of O
rationality O

wit O
, O
discipline O

calmness O

, O
above O
all O
, O
premeditation O

deliberation O
, O
and O
a O
lack O
of O
hastiness O
into O
impetuous O
action O
that O
is O
not O
deliberated O
, O
especially O
as O
they O
are O
the O
inventers O
of O
chess O
, O
the O
game O
of O
the O
smart O
, O
the O
witty O
, O
and O
the O
strategic O
planners O
. O

It O
has O
been O
known O
about O
the O
Persian B-NORP
mentality O
that O
it O
is O
innately O
patient O
, O
as O
is O
obvious O
with O
the O
makers O
of O
the O
famous O
Persian B-NORP
carpets O
. O

They O
are O
very O
patient O
and O
enduring O
. O

They O
wait O
years B-DATE
and I-DATE
years I-DATE
and O
do O
not O
get O
bored O
, O
so O
that O
they O
may O
weave O

a O

full O

while O

tend O
to O
get O
bored O
fast O

But O
I O
do O
not O
know O
where O
those O
historic O
characteristics O
of O
chess O
suddenly O
evaporated O
in O
Iranian B-NORP
policy O
, O
when O
the O
governing O
organization O
in O
Tehran B-GPE
blessed O
the O
deed O
of O

was O

when O

himself O

the O

the O
phrase O
" O
May O

" O

Admirers O
of O
Iranian B-NORP
wisdom O
did O
not O
believe O
this O
fatal O
lapse O
of O
Iranian B-NORP
politicians O
and O
their O
followers O
. O

Some O
might O
forgive O
Iran B-GPE
for O
its O
yearning O
to O
see O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
hanged O
, O
as O
a O
type O
of O
retaliation O
and O
revenge O
, O
especially O
as O
it O
had O
fought O
him O
for O
eight B-DATE
long I-DATE
years I-DATE

in O
which O
it O
suffered O
hundreds B-CARDINAL
of I-CARDINAL
thousands I-CARDINAL
of O
souls O

extreme O
losses O

But O
no O

it O
could O
have O
picked O
another O
more O
wise O
and O
less O
damaging O
time O
, O
for O
itself O
and O
for O
Muslims B-NORP
in O
general O
, O
to O
retaliate O
against O
its O
old O
rival O
, O
rather O
than O
committing O
a O
terrible O
deed O
that O
Arabs B-NORP
, O
and O
even O
all O
Sunnis B-NORP
, O
would O
not O
forgive O
it O

tens B-DATE

hanging O
him O

what O
is O
a O

for O
the O

majority O
of O
Muslims B-NORP

I O
do O
not O
know O
how O
Iran B-GPE
fell O
in O
that O
dangerous O
trap O
, O
even O
if O
it O
were O
an O
evil O
American B-NORP
one O
, O
as O
it O
is O
known O
about O
Iranians B-NORP
that O
they O
are O
smarter O
than O
to O
fall O
into O
American B-NORP
traps O
, O
no O
matter O
how O
cleverly O
and O
wittingly O
they O
are O
set O
. O

But O
they O
fell O
this O
time O
, O
a O
terrible O
fall O
. O

If O
I O
were O
in O
the O
place O
of O
the O
wise O
ones O
of O
Iran B-GPE

I O
would O

And O
I O
hope O
no O
one O
is O
overnice O
and O
says O
the O
execution O
was O
totally O
an O
Iraqi B-NORP
internal O
affair O
, O
because O
this O
blatant O
joke O
can O
not O
even O
be O
passed O
on O

to O

which O
implemented O
the O
execution O

with O
the O
recognition O

the O

government O
, O
to O
postpone O
the O

, O
especially O
as O
the O
Americans B-NORP
had O
confirmed O
that O
they O
were O

did O
not O
hear O

Iranian B-NORP
denial O
of O
the O

announcements O
about O
the O
execution O
. O

Even O

a O
liar O
and O
wants O
to O
create O
division O

would O

the O
judgment O

for O
which O
they O
will O
pay O
the O
price O
for O
tens B-DATE

and O
in O

to O
pull O
the O
carpet O
from O
beneath O
some O
of O
the O
Arab B-NORP
regimes O
which O
they O
now O
accuse O
of O
provocation O
against O
the O
Shiites B-NORP
. O

How O
strange O
the O
situation O
of O
the O
Iranians B-NORP
really O
is O
. O

On O
one B-CARDINAL
hand O
, O
they O
barbarically O
offend O
the O
feelings O
of O
more B-PERCENT
than I-PERCENT
eighty I-PERCENT
- I-PERCENT
five I-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
of O
the O
world O
's O
Muslims B-NORP
, O
the O
Sunnis B-NORP
, O
and O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
they O
accuse O
some O
Islamic B-NORP
countries O
of O
sectarian O
provocation O
against O
Iran B-GPE
, O
as O
the O
Iranians B-NORP
and O
their O
allies O
in O
the O
region O
complain O
that O
there O
are O
obvious O
attempts O
to O
wedge O

create O
division O
between O
the O
Shiites B-NORP

the O
Sunnis B-NORP
on O
the O
part O
of O
America B-GPE
, O
Israel B-GPE
, O
and O
some O
Arabs B-NORP
. O

This O
might O
be O
totally O
true O
, O

but O
if O
Iran B-GPE
does O
not O
really O
want O
to O
inflame O
grudges O
between O
the O
Shiites B-NORP

the O

its O
penetration O
on O
the O

as O
it O

why O

it O

do O

into O

No O
, O
many O

declared O
that O
his O
grave O

a O

If O
Saddam B-PERSON
was O
left O
for O
ten B-DATE
more I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
the O
man O
might O
have O
died O
naturally O
without O
any O
ado O

But O
now O
that O
Iran B-GPE
and O
its O
agents O
have O
executed O
him O
in O
this O
horrible O
way O
, O
he O
has O
entered O

by O

after O

This O
was O
thanks O

the O
" O
terrible O
" O
Persian B-NORP

" O

Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
was O
one O
with O
the O
utmost O
hatred O
and O
enmity O
to O
the O
Persians B-NORP
. O

Maybe O
he O
used O
to O
pray O
a O
lot O
against O
them O
, O
and O
God O
accepted O
his O
prayers O
and O
inspired O
them O
to O
conspire O
in O
his O
execution O
on O
the O
Muslims B-NORP
' O
big O
feast O

Eid B-EVENT
Al I-EVENT

would O
remain O

I O
do O
not O
know O
how O
the O
Iranians B-NORP
measured O
it O
, O
and O
I O
do O
not O
know O
why O
they O
sacrificed O
their O
tremendous O
popularity O
in O
the O
Arab B-NORP
street O
in O
return O
for O
satisfying O
a O
cheap O
and O
impetuous O
desire O
for O

. O

A O
few O
months B-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
Iran B-GPE
was O
a O
symbol O
of O
resistance O
, O
jihad O
, O
dignity O
, O
and O
challenge O
, O
thanks O
to O
its O
support O
of O
Arab B-NORP
resistance O
movements O
like O
Hezbollah B-ORG
in O
Lebanon B-GPE
and O
Hamas B-ORG
in O
Palestine B-GPE
, O
while O
the O
popularity O
of O
the O
Arab B-NORP
regimes O
was O
hitting O
rock O
bottom O
. O

The O
Iranians B-NORP
had O
the O
right O
to O
be O
proud O
of O
the O
glorious O
victory O
Hezbollah B-ORG
achieved O
over O
Israel B-GPE
. O

But O
now O
, O
this O
victory O
has O
totally O
evaporated O
in O
the O
Arab B-NORP
street O
, O
thanks O
to O
the O
stupidity O
of O
those O
who O
ordered O
the O
execution O
of O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
and O
the O
dance O
over O
his O
body O
. O

No O
, O
the O
public O
support O
for O
Hezbollah B-ORG
has O
even O
turned O
into O
a O
tremendous O
indignation O
from O
Iran B-GPE
and O
its O
allies O
in O
the O
Arab B-NORP
region O
. O

I O
heard O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
connecting O
the O
Persian B-NORP
enemy O
and O
the O
Zionist B-NORP
enemy O
, O
while O
Iran B-GPE
, O
until O
months O
ago O
, O
was O
the O
striker O
in O
confronting O
the O
Zionist B-NORP
and O
American B-NORP
project O
in O
the O
region O
. O

Iran B-GPE
caused O
great O
embarrassment O
for O
everyone O
who O
has O
supported O
its O
positions O
in O
the O
past O
. O

I O
have O
heard O
from O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
who O
used O
to O
defend O
Iran B-GPE
in O
the O
Arab B-NORP
street O
, O
and O
they O
have O
totally O
turned O
against O
it O
and O
started O
to O
call O
it O
" O
dirty O
Persian B-NORP
" O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
loathing O
and O
hatred O
. O

In O
recent B-DATE
months I-DATE
, O
Hezbollah B-ORG
's O
performance O
in O
the O
war O
with O
Israel B-GPE
, O
with O
Iranian B-NORP
President O
Ahmadinejad B-PERSON
's O
announcements O
, O
speeches O
, O
challenge O
of O
the O
American B-NORP
administration O
, O
and O
his O
insistence O
on O
finishing O
the O
process O
of O
enriching O
uranium O
, O
used O
to O
resurrect O
pride O
and O
dignity O
in O
the O
souls O
of O
millions B-CARDINAL
of O
Arabs B-NORP
and O
Muslims B-NORP
. O

But O
the O
scene O
of O
Saddam B-PERSON
's O
execution O
turned O
the O
tables O
upside O
down O
on O
Iran B-GPE
for O
a O
time O
that O
might O
last O
for O
long O
; O
let O
alone O
the O
horrible O
offense O
to O
Hezbollah B-ORG
, O
which O
lost O
a O
big O
portion O
of O
the O
street O
. O

The O
proof O
is O
that O
its O
biggest O
supporters O
in O
Jordan B-GPE
, O
for O
example O
, O
boycotted O
the B-ORG
Manar I-ORG
Channel I-ORG
, O
which O
used O
to O
have O
great O
popularity O
in O
the O
Arab B-NORP
street O
. O

The O
Iranians B-NORP
, O
with O
their O
spirit O
of O
revenge O
, O
have O
destroyed O
the O
most O
famous O
Arab B-NORP
resistance O
movement O
, O
after O
it O
was O
filling O
the O
world O
and O
occupying O
the O
minds O
of O
humans O
. O

They O
even O
turned O
the O
people O
against O
it O
. O

No O
matter O
how O
the O
answers O
vary O
, O
as O
Mohamed B-PERSON
Abu I-PERSON
Roman I-PERSON
debates O
, O
what O
is O
obvious O
is O
that O
the O
image O
of O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
execution O
would O
cost O
Iran B-GPE
a O
lot O
in O
the O
next O
stage O
. O

It O
will O
make O
its O
credibility O
very O
weak O
, O
and O
it O
will O
also O
harm O
the O
image O
of O
its O
ally O
powers O
in O
various O
countries O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
revealed O
that O

tinctures O
Iran B-GPE

its O
various O
positions O
, O
far O
from O
the O
claims O
of O
enmity O
to O
America B-GPE
and O
Israel B-GPE
, O
are O
only O
used O
to O
serve O
Iran B-GPE
's O
interests O
. O

Beyond O
that O
, O
the O
image O
of O
executing O
Saddam B-PERSON
and O
the O
repercussions O
it O
created O
cause O
a O
large O
embarrassment O
for O
Iran B-GPE

in O

like O
Hamas B-ORG

many O

as O

as O
the O
political O
and O
public O
powers O

in O
the O
Arab B-NORP
countries O
- O
which O
stood O

were O
calling O

with O
Iran B-GPE

of O

These O
powers O
face O
a O
state O
of O
strong O

similar O
to O
the O

Khareq I-PERSON

As O
an O
introduction O
to O
the O
topic O
, O
I O
will O
recount O
these O
two B-CARDINAL
incidents O
for O
you O
: O

1- O
In O
Al B-LOC
Sewedi I-LOC
district O
in O
Riyadh B-GPE
city O
, O
I O
stood O
in O
front O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
mosques O
, O

and O
I O
saw O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
Arab B-NORP
residents O
in O
a O
moment O
of O
astonishment O
while O
a O
car O
was O
leaving O
the O
place O
at O
a O
high O
speed O
. O

When O
I O
asked O
him O
what O
had O
happened O
, O
he O
stated O
that O
three B-CARDINAL
young O
men O
had O
stolen O
his O
cell O
phone O
and O
wallet O
. O

I O
left O
the O
place O
to O
catch O
them O
, O
and O
get O
their O
license O
plate O
numbers O
. O

They O
had O
to O
stop O
at O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
traffic O
signs O
, O
which O
gets O
crowded O
, O
and O
they O
did O
not O
notice O
that O
I O
was O
behind O
them O
. O

I O
informed O
Operations B-ORG
of O
the O
incident O
, O
that O
they O
were O
in O
front O
of O
me O
at O
the O
time O
, O
and O
that O
there O
was O
a O
security O
patrol O
I O
had O
seen O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
traffic O
sign O
. O

But O
I O
was O
shocked O
when O
Operations B-ORG
told O
me O
, O
" O
Do O
not O
bother O
with O
them O
. O

Go O
to O
the O
police O
department O
and O
report O
it O
. O
" O

Oh O
people O
, O
the O
thieves O
are O
in O
front O
of O
me O
; O
inform O
the O
patrols O
about O
them O
. O

They O
told O
me O
, O
" O
It O
is O
none O
of O
your O
business O
. O
" O

I O
told O
them O
, O
" O
I O
will O
not O
go O
to O
the O
police O
department O
. O

This O
is O
their O
car O
number O
; O
if O
you O
want O
them O
, O
chase O
them O
. O

The O
car O
might O
be O
stolen O
. O
" O

And O
I O
hung O
up O
out O
of O
oppression O
... O

2- O
On O
the B-FAC
eastern I-FAC
ring I-FAC
road I-FAC
, O
three B-CARDINAL
young O
men O
in O
a O
Lexus B-ORG
car O
caught O
my O
attention O
. O

They O
were O
noticeably O
tense O
and O
confused O
. O

On O
the O
same O
road O
, O
there O
was O
a O
search O
point O
. O

I O
informed O
Operations B-ORG
, O
and O
I O
gave O
them O
the O
car O
number O
. O

They O
said O
there O
was O
no O
report O
on O
the O
car O
. O

I O
told O
them O
, O
" O
Inform O
the O
search O
point O
to O
check O
them O
. O
" O

He O
said O
to O
me O
, O
" O
You O
want O
to O
teach O
us O
our O
job O
? O
" O

And O
they O
hung O
up O
. O

After O
about O
an O
hour O
, O
Operations B-ORG
called O
me O
, O
and O
they O
said O
, O
" O
Brother O
, O
do O
you O
know O
where O
the O
car O
went O
, O
right O
or O
left O
? O

It O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
stolen O
. O
" O

I O
laughed O
the O
laugh O
of O
the O
oppressed O
, O
and O
I O
said O
oh O
, O
oh O

bullying O
, O
depredation O
, O
and O
theft O
. O

But O
it O
is O
notable O
that O
the O
Egyptians B-NORP
strongly O
and O
very O
quickly O
eliminated O
this O
practice O
, O
and O
our O
Egyptian B-NORP
brothers O
treated O
the O
causes O
, O
the O
most O
important O
of O
which O
is O
strengthening O
the O
security O
agency O
and O
enforcing O
police O
members O
in O
the O
districts O
and O
street O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
they O
know O
that O
the O
continuation O
of O
such O
actions O
affect O
the O
reputation O
of O
the O
country O
, O
in O
case O
they O
continue O
; O
they O
would O
eliminate O
trust O
in O
the O
internal O
security O
of O
the O
country O
. O

Now O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
the O
bullying O
which O
was O
in O
Cairo B-GPE
moved O
to O
Riyadh B-GPE
, O
the O
capital O
, O
which O
has O
recently O
witnessed O
robberies O
, O
kidnappings O
, O
beatings O
.... O
etc. O

And O
we O
are O
still O
only O
watching O
what O
is O
happening O
now O
; O
the O
citizen O
still O
faces O
many O
problems O
and O
robberies O
. O

The O
thief O
had O
some O
shyness O
before O
and O
fear O
of O
the O
security O
forces O
, O
but O
now O
, O
there O
is O
no O
fear O
. O

They O
are O
not O
ashamed O
; O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
steals O
in O
front O
of O
everyone O
and O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
even O
from O
a O
policeman O
, O
and O
this O
happened O
in O
fact O
. O

The O
citizen O
now O
, O
these O
things O
which O
happen O
now O
have O
become O
normal O
to O
him O
. O

He O
is O
used O
to O
them O
, O
because O
of O
the O
negligence O
of O
security O
members O
and O
their O
indifference O
to O
what O
is O
happening O
now O
, O
their O
lack O
of O
consideration O
for O
the O
complaints O
of O
people O
and O
their O
reports O
, O
and O
the O
insistence O
of O
security O
patrols O
that O
it O
is O
essential O
to O
go O
to O
the O
police O
departments O
to O
report O
any O
security O
violations O
, O
though O
most O
reports O
need O
quick O
and O
instant O
action O
. O

And O
because O
of O
the O
complications O
happening O
now O
, O
the O
chaos O
about O
which O
we O
hear O
and O
see O
has O
prevailed O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
these O
things O
were O
weak O
in O
the O
beginning O
, O
but O
they O
have O
grown O
now O
and O
reached O
the O
level O
they O
reached O
because O
of O
security O
weakness O
and O
indecisiveness O
toward O
such O
issues O
, O
which O
have O
become O
a O
daily O
reality O
before O
our O
eyes O
. O

They O
happen O
in O
our O
streets O
, O
homes O
, O
and O
cars O
. O

If O
these O
shameful O
practices O
which O
are O
happening O
in O
our O
country O
are O
not O
treated O
decisively O
, O
we O
should O
expect O
bigger O
than O
them O
. O

The O
citizen O
would O
be O
forced O
to O
own O
a O
weapon O
to O
protect O
himself O
, O
at O
the O
time O
when O
the O
security O
agencies O
failed O
to O
protect O
him O
... O

I O
am O
talking O
here O
about O
what O
is O
happening O
in O
my O
surroundings O
and O
the O
surroundings O
of O
those O
close O
to O
me O
. O

I O
saw O
what O
is O
happening O
with O
my O
own O
eyes O
, O
so O
what O
do O
you O
think O
of O
a O
big O
city O
like O
the O
city O
of O
Riyadh B-GPE
? O

You O
hardly O
enter O
a O
gathering O
or O
house O
without O
hearing O
horrible O
stories O
and O
tales O
, O
and O
the O
fear O
, O
the O
fear O
, O
is O
for O
Riyadh B-GPE
to O
become O
an O
example O
for O
criminality O
like O
the O
American B-NORP
city O
of O
Chicago B-GPE
... O

So O
pay O
attention O
to O
your O
cell O
phone O
, O
wallets O
, O
houses O
, O
and O
cars O
, O
because O
the O
situation O
has O
become O
unbearable O
. O

Some O
time O
ago O
, O
my O
car O
was O
stolen O
, O
and O
I O
reported O
it O
. O

The O
officer O
said O
, O
" O
May O
God O
not O
offend O
you O
, O
but O
search O
for O
it O
with O
us O
. O
" O

The O
funny O
thing O
is O
that O
I O
found O
it O
myself O
after O
only O
two B-DATE
days I-DATE
. O

.. O

As O
for O
what O
is O
happening O
in O
the O
police O
departments O
, O
we O
find O
officers O
trying O
to O
reach O
reconciliations O
by O
all O
means O
, O
because O
they O
do O
not O
want O
to O
tire O
themselves O
with O
an O
investigation O
. O

The O
one O
who O
commits O
assault O
and O
the O
victim O
are O
equal O
to O
him O
; O
if O
the O
victim O
refuses O
reconciliation O
, O
he O
starts O
to O
procrastinate O
and O
draw O
the O
issue O
out O
. O

As O
for O
the O
prosecution O
panel O
and O
the O
general O
investigation O
, O
they O
protect O
the O
gangs O
and O
individual O
criminals O
, O
per O
the O
system O
, O
as O
they O
release O
them O
from O
jail O
on O
bail O
without O
spending O
a O
night O
in O
it O
. O

The O
utmost O
crisis O
is O
that O
the O
police O
departments O
know O
the O
locations O
of O
criminal O
gangs O
. O

They O
know O
where O
robberies O
take O
place O
, O
but O
indifference O
spreads O
in O
their O
bodies O
. O

In O
a O
short O
period O
, O
no B-DATE
more I-DATE
than I-DATE
a I-DATE
month I-DATE
, O
several B-CARDINAL
of O
my O
relatives O
and O
friends O
were O
robbed O
. O

One O
can O
measure O
based O
on O
that O
what O
is O
happening O
in O
the O
city O
of O
Riyadh B-GPE

what O
is O
missing O

? O

If O
the O
reason O
is O
known O
, O
the O
result O
is O
clear O
. O
0 O

The O
problem O
is O
not O
in O
the O
unavailability O
of O
Islamic B-NORP
legislative O
evidence O
upon O
which O
Islamic B-NORP
justice O
is O
based O
; O
but O
rather O
in O
a O
reality O
in O
which O
you O
live O
and O
in O
which O
justice O
is O
excluded O
. O

The O
judge O
00 O
is O
not O
qualified O
for O
the O
judiciary O
and O
is O
not O
independent O
. O

This O
is O
what O
deprives O
the O
judge O
of O
his O
legitimacy O
in O
judging O
, O
0 O
as O
he O
follows O
the O
dictations O
of O
the O

The O
judge O

the O
lawyer O
. O

The O
lawyer O
is O
qualified O
for O
positive O
constitutions O
that O
contradict O
Islamic B-NORP
legislation O

This O
caused O
the O

to O
use O
this O
golden O
opportunity O
to O
release O
the O

for O
large O
amounts O
of O

estimated O
at O
several B-CARDINAL

Some O

even O
quit O

splendid O
subject O
during O

like O
it O

It O
is O
called O
" O
Ten B-CARDINAL
ways O
to O
build O
a O
flexible O
personality O
" O
. O

What O
distinguishes O
us O
as O
people O
is O
the O
independent O
personality O
whether O
strong O
or O
weak O
, O
hesitant O
or O
fickle O
, O
balanced O
or O
extreme O
. O

The O
building O
of O
a O
strong O
flexible O
personality O
is O
considered O
a O
personal O
journey O
in O
itself O
as O
it O
passes O
through O
a O
number O
of O
phases O
and O
stages O
, O
and O
is O
done O
through O
strengthening O
and O
building O
and O
refining O
. O

I O
do O
not O
believe O
that O
one O
possesses O
a O
strong O
personality O
by O
nature O
, O
but O
one O
does O
possess O
the O
basics O
. O

This O
is O
necessary O
because O
what O
comes O
later O
is O
the O
real O
basis O
for O
determining O
personality O

The B-ORG
American I-ORG

a O

called O
" B-WORK_OF_ART
The I-WORK_OF_ART
Way I-WORK_OF_ART
to I-WORK_OF_ART
Flexibility I-WORK_OF_ART
" I-WORK_OF_ART
aimed O
at O
building O
and O
reinforcing O
the O
flexible O
personality O
and O
training O
people O
wanting O
to O
attain O
such O
a O
personality O
easily O
. O

Here O
are O
the O
most O
important O
of O
points O
for O
you O
: O

1. O
The O
creation O
of O
social O
relationships O
: O
the O
establishing O
of O
good O
relations O
with O
members O
of O
the O
family O
or O
friends O
is O
considered O
to O
be O
a O
very O
important O
matter O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
acceptance O
of O
help O
and O
support O
from O
those O
who O
care O
about O
you O
because O
it O
acts O
to O
strengthen O
flexibility O
. O

Many O
people O
also O
find O
that O
joining O
and O
entering O
civil O
and O
the O
other O
local O
groups O
that O
support O
the O
community O
helps O
them O
regain O
hope O
, O
and O
also O
helps O
other O
individuals O
in O
society O
. O

2. O
Avoiding O
seeing O
crises O
as O
insurmountable O
problems O
: O
you O
might O
not O
be O
able O
to O
change O
the O
fact O
that O
annoying O
incidents O
happen O
but O
you O
can O
change O
the O
way O
you O
interpret O
them O
and O
your O
reaction O
to O
these O
incidents O
. O

Try O
to O
see O
beyond O
the O
present O
and O
think O
that O
the O
future O
circumstances O
will O
be O
better O
. O

Always O
put O
your O
confidence O
and O
your O
belief O
in O
a O
better O
tomorrow B-ORG
, O
this B-DATE
day I-DATE
will O
surely O
come O
. O

3. O
Accept O
that O
change O
is O
part O
of O
life O
: O
you O
might O
not O
be O
able O
to O
achieve O
some O
of O
the O
aims O
because O
of O
certain O
circumstances O
but O
accept O
that O
the O
current O
situation O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
you O
can O
not O
change O
it O
may O
play O
a O
part O
in O
your O
acceptance O
of O
reality O
and O
pay O
attention O
to O
other O
projects O
in O
life O
. O

Do O
not O
stand O
and O
cry O
over O
the O
ruins O
. O

4. O
Move O
towards O
your O
goals O
, O
develop O
some O
realistic O
goals O
. O

Do O
things O
systematically O
- O
even O
if O
it O
seems O
like O
small O
achievements O
, O
they O
are O
nevertheless O
some O
sort O
of O
steps O
on O
the O
way O
forward O
. O

Instead O
of O
concentrating O
on O
tasks O
which O
seem O
unachievable O
, O
ask O
yourself O
: O
" O
What O
can O
I O
achieve O
today B-DATE
? O
" O

5. O
Take O
decisive O
steps O
: O
take O
decisive O
steps O
instead O
of O
withdrawing O
completely O
from O
problems O
and O
pressures O
and O
fleeing O
from O
them O
. O

Decisive O
decisions O
will O
cut O
the O
doubt O
with O
confidence O
, O
strengthen O
your O
determination O
and O
make O
you O
tougher O
in O
dealing O
with O
the O
consequences O
and O
in O
benefiting O
from O
mistakes O
. O

6. O
Look O
for O
opportunities O
to O
discover O
yourself O
: O
people O
are O
always O
discovering O
new O
things O
about O
themselves O
, O
they O
realize O
that O
they O
have O
matured O
in O
some O
way O
or O
other O
as O
a O
result O
of O
their O
previous O
experiences O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
time O
people O
who O
have O
gone O
through O
harsh O
experiences O
say O
that O
they O
have O
gained O
from O
their O
experiences O
and O
have O
become O
better O
people O
, O
their O
personality O
has O
grown O
stronger O
and O
their O
feelings O
have O
grown O
stronger O
as O
well O
as O
their O
confidence O
in O
themselves O
. O

7. O
Nurture O
the O
positive O
point O
of O
view O
in O
yourself O
: O
we O
are O
not O
asking O
you O
to O
become O
over O
- O
confident O
in O
yourself O
, O
proud O
and O
arrogant O
towards O
others O
, O
but O
that O
you O
become O
confident O
in O
your O
abilities O
to O
work O
and O
achieve O
. O

Do O
not O
blame O
yourself O
too O
much O
because O
you O
will O
collapse O
at O
the O
slightest O
problem O
. O

Keep O
things O
in O
perspective O
: O
even O
when O
you O
face O
very O
painful O
events O
, O
try O
to O
consider O
them O
an O
exhausting O
phase O
in O
the O
course O
of O
life O
, O
and O
that O
life O
is O
bigger O
and O
wider O
than O
this O
problem O
. O

Avoid O
exaggerating O
events O
and O
problems O
, O
keep O
things O
in O
perspective O
so O
as O
to O
be O
able O
to O
overcome O
them O
easily O
. O

Keep O
an O
optimistic O
frame O
of O
mind O
: O
even O
if O
the O
room O
for O
hope O
has O
faded O
in O
the O
eyes O
of O
many O
and O
you O
too O
, O
keep O
a O
positive O
frame O
of O
mind O
vis-à-vis O
the O
future O
, O
try O
to O
imagine O
what O
you O
want O
and O
not O
the O
problems O
that O
will O
hit O
you O
. O

Take O
care O
of O
yourself O
: O
pay O
attention O
to O
your O
own O
needs O
and O
your O
feelings O
. O

Take O
part O
in O
activities O
which O
you O
enjoy O
and O
in O
which O
you O
relax O
. O

Practice O
sport O
regularly O
to O
obtain O
the O
physical O
benefit O
, O
maintain O
your O
mind O
and O
your O
nutrition O
and O
your O

to O
guarantee O
that O
you O

Thank O

But O
I O

still O
open O

I O
repeat O
and O
I O
say O

... O
If O
you O
want O
it O
to O

It O
seems O
that O
your O
aspirations O
are O
in O
conflict O
with O
your O
desires O
just O
as O
the O
first O
part O
of O
your O
handle O
cancels O
its O
last O
out O
. O

The O
disadvantaged O
wishes O
and O
the O
strong O
acts O
, O
and O
you O
have O
disadvantaged O
yourself O
to O
satisfy O
others O
. O

However O
, O
your O
contradictory O
handle O
has O
enabled O
me O
to O
invent O
myself O
a O
contradictory O
handle O
and O
call O
it O
The B-PERSON
Unfaithful I-PERSON
Divorcee I-PERSON
. O

It O
is O
shameful O
to O
decide O
that O
our O
desires O
are O
the O
correct O
act O
, O
and O
that O
they O
are O
the O
ideal O
for O
life O
. O

Perhaps O
this O
is O
as O
a O
result O
of O
a O
concealed O
pride O
, O
but O
why O
do O
you O
judge O
the O
acts O
of O
others O
as O
sick O
and O
yours O
as O
perfect O
? O

The O
same O
rationale O
that O
allows O
you O
to O
judge O
the O
acts O
of O
others O
has O
allowed O
us O
to O
judge O
you O
!! O

From O

lots O

place O

The O

this O

is O
joint O
- O
stock O
companies O
including O
real O

companies O

industrial O
companies O

many O

to O
expel O
the O
ghost O

from O

lives O

They O
are O
many O

We O
find O
an O

some O
of O
them O
. O

It O
has O
been O
said O
that O
necessity O

the O

But O
I O
say O
necessity O
is O
the O
mother O
of O
carelessness O

Of O
course O
, O
I O
find O
no O
excuse O
for O
these O
companies O
. O

I O
will O
mention O
some O
of O
them O
which O
formulated O
all O
their O
studies O
in O
a O
way O
to O
enable O
them O
to O
milk O
money O
out O
of O
small O

the O

widows O
and O

through O
advisory O
offices O
which O
master O
with O
perfection O
feasibility O
studies O
with O
negative O
action O
. O

This O
is O
what O
leads O
us O
to O
be O
sure O
that O
everything O
has O
negative O
aspects O
just O
as O
it O
has O
positive O
aspects O
, O
like O
medicines O
which O
cure O
a O
disease O
but O
while O
doing O
so O
cause O
another O
disease O
, O
and O
similar O
repercussions O
which O
sometimes O
lead O
to O
destruction O
. O

-LRB- O
anyway O
. O
-RRB- O

But O
why O
not O
make O
conferences O
also O
similar O
to O
those O
first O
by O
targeting O
-LRB- O
government O
ministries O
-RRB- O
in O

. O

The O
state O
, O
may O
God O
protect O
it O
, O
and O
at O
its O
head O
our O
wise O
leadership O
which O
has O
spared O
no O
effort O
to O
serve O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
in O
all O
aspects O
of O
his O
life O
, O
the O
last O
being O
this O
year B-DATE
's O
budget O
which O
, O
thank O
God O
and O
his O
beneficence O
, O
surpassed O
all O
our O
expectations O
. O

This O
is O
the O
eagerness O
of O
the O
father O
of O
all O
, O
the O
good O
king O
, O
to O
make O
us O
happy O
. O

Before O
, O
it O
was O
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
's I-DATE
budget O
which O
was O
also O
a O
happy O
surprise O
. O

And O
before O
that O
, O
dozens B-CARDINAL
of O
annual O
budgets O
which O
were O
prepared O
for O
the O
development O
of O
the O
country O
and O
the O
citizen O
. O

Consequently O
, O
we O
do O
not O
see O
this O
budget O
spent O
as O
we O
would O
like O
and O
look O
forward O
to O
, O
but O
rather O
as O
recommended O
by O
the O
leadership O
in O
how O
to O
spend O
it O
. O

Back O
to O
this O
year B-DATE
's O
budget O
, O
which O
surpassed O
all O
bets O
, O
and O
was O
appropriate O
for O
a O
country O
like O
ours O
. O

This O
is O
what O
leads O
me O
to O
demand O
monitoring O
of O
these O
ministries O
whose O
safes O
have O
suffered O
indigestion O
from O
the O
budgets O
that O
end O
all O
the O
lean O
years B-DATE
and O
halt O
all O
the O
series O
of O
excuses O
which O
we O
hear O
from O
some O
that O
all O
the O
required O
development O
projects O
, O
which O
in O
turn O
will O
make O
the O
country O
and O
the O
citizen O
happy O
, O
lacked O
liquidity O
, O
and O
other O
excuses O
, O
such O
as O
the O
public O
debt O
and O
other O
acceptable O
and O
unacceptable O
excuses O
. O

This B-DATE
year I-DATE
there O
is O
no O
excuse O
for O
anyone O
, O
especially O
Abu B-PERSON
Matab I-PERSON
-LRB- O
may O
God O
protect O
him O
-RRB- O
, O
who O
was O
harsh O
with O
the O
ministers O
and O
demanded O
work O
and O
accomplishment O
from O
them O
after O
offering O
to O
each O
minister O
what O
he O
needed O
. O

Because O
we O
are O
still O
in O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
months O
, O
it O
became O
a O
duty O
to O
monitor O
this O
ministry O
by O
many O
authorities O
, O
not O
only O
the B-ORG
Surveillance I-ORG
Authority I-ORG
. O

Rather O
, O
this O
budget O
requires O
the O
creation O
of O
a O
ministry O
concerned O
with O
monitoring O
and O
surveillance O
, O
and O
consequently O
holding O
accountable O
. O

Let O
its O
creation O
happen O
with O
the O
new O
cabinet O
formation O
in O
particular O
, O
so O
it O
enjoys O
a O
commitment O
of O
transparency O
and O
accountability O
. O

How O
nice O
it O
would O
be O
if O
the O
strategy O
of O
this O
surveillance O
authority O
were O
centered O
around O
the O
following O
question O
: O
where O
will O
this O
be O
spent O
after O
programming O
the O
spending O
mechanisms O
and O
reviewing O
plans O
and O
programs O
and O
projects O
for O
which O
this O
major O
budget O
was O
allocated O
? O

And O
how O
nice O
it O
would O
be O
if O
its O
disbursement O
were O
scheduled O
according O
to O
the O
duration O
of O
projects O
and O
the O
method O
of O
their O
implementation O
provided O
that O
at O
the B-DATE
end I-DATE
of I-DATE
each I-DATE
year I-DATE
it O
presents O
an O
estimated O
budget O
for O
the B-DATE
coming I-DATE
year I-DATE
along O
with O
a O
review O
of O
what O
was O
spent O
from O
the O
previous O
budget O
, O
which O
of O
course O
will O
not O
be O
spent O
all O
in O
one B-CARDINAL
year O
, O
because O
some O
major O
projects O
can O
not O
be O
completed O
in O
one B-CARDINAL
year O
and O
need O
several B-DATE
years I-DATE
so O
we O
can O
see O
it O
in O
the O
land O
of O
reality O
. O

Through O
this O
mechanism O
no O
ministry O
will O
be O
allowed O
to O
ask O
annually O
for O
an O
increase O
in O
its O
budget O
if O
it O
does O
n't O
submit O
a O
report O
showing O
where O
and O
how O
of O
the O
money O
was O
spent O
. O

If O
the O
projects O
are O
not O
completed O
during O
the O
year B-DATE
, O
then O
let O
the O
current O
budget O
, O
or O
the O
remaining O
part O
of O
it O
, O
be O
carried O
forward O
, O
until O
these O
projects O
for O
which O
this O
large O
budget O
was O
allocated O
are O
completed O
. O

And O
let O
some O
of O
the O
tasks O
of O
this O
ministry O
which O
we O
hope O
will O
be O
established O
be O
monitoring O
all O
this O
and O
taking O
severely O
to O
task O
any O
ministry O
that O
hoards O
one B-CARDINAL
budget O
after O
another O
while O
releasing O
a O
lot O
of O

about O
which O
we O
do O
not O

any O

We O

we O
all O

to O
monitor O
, O
hold O
to O
account O
, O
and O
control O
the O
implementation O
of O
projects O
. O

National O
responsibility O
demands O
that O
we O
workers O
in O
the O
three B-CARDINAL
types O
of O
mass O
media O
-- O
watched O
, O
listened O
to O
, O
and O
read O
-- O
demand O
that O
the O
leadership O
have O
a O
suitable O
entourage O
, O
and O
they O
follow O
up O
all O
cases O
of O
deficiency O
and O
dereliction O
and O
forcefully O
point O
them O
out O
so O
that O
the O
negligent O
people O
will O
not O
be O
negligent O
and O
the O
sloppy O
people O
will O
not O
be O
sloppy O
. O

In O
that O
way O
we O
will O
monitor O
all O
the O
groundbreaking O
achievements O
which O
these O
ministries O
also O
make O
, O
and O
shed O
light O
on O
them O
while O
presenting O
positive O
media O
support O
. O

With O
such O
monitoring O
and O
care O
, O
we O
serve O
the O
country O
and O
its O
treasures O
, O
first O
among O
which O
is O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
people O
. O

Through O
this O
, O
we O
serve O
the O
interests O
of O
the O
country O
and O
its O
government O
, O
which O
this O
year O
released O
the O
largest O
budget O
in O
more O
than O
30 B-CARDINAL
years O
, O

This O
is O
clear O
evidence O
that O
our O
not O
being O
drained O
financially O
and O
not O
suffering O
human O
losses O
in O
various O
wars O
has O
provided O
our O
country O
with O
a O
budget O
like O
this O
one O
which O
will O
be O
spent O
on O
the O
redevelopment O
of O
the O
country O
and O
its O
sons O
in O
all O
aspects O
of O
life O
. O

Although O
the O

-- O
the O
residents O
of O
the B-FAC
White I-FAC
House I-FAC
-- O
monitored O
our O
budget O
and O
had O
hopes O
for O
it O
-- O
the O
evidence O
for O
that O
is O

who O

, O
in O
which O
a O

America B-GPE

. O

Tom B-PERSON

" O
Why O

" O
. O

He O
did O

have O
Egypt B-GPE

offer O
its O

as O
an O
alternative O
to O
the O
American B-NORP
soldiers O
, O
claiming O
that O
what O
is O
happening O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
is O
a O
civil O
war O
, O
and O
if O
this O
civil O
war O
continues O
, O
the O
first O
ones O
to O
be O
harmed O
will O
be O
the O
countries O
of O
the B-LOC
Arabian I-LOC
Gulf I-LOC
. O

Their O
arrogance O
is O
amazing O
. O

Are O
they O
not O
pleased O
that O
our O
economic O
condition O
has O
recovered O
and O
God O
has O
favored O
us O
with O
this O
abundant O
good O
? O

We O
will O
witness O
the O
mechanisms O
of O
bargaining O
after O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
well O
- O
regarded O
Rice B-PERSON
who O
certainly O
visited O
the O
occupying O
entity O
and O
arranged O
a O
new O
game O
with O
it O
called O
the O
establishment O
of O
a O
new O
Palestinian B-NORP
state O
to O
entice O
us O
to O
support O
it O
materially O
and O
morally O
. O

It O
is O
worth O
mentioning O
that O
in O
his O
speech O
Bush B-PERSON
criticized O
the O
government O
of O
al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Maliki I-PERSON
. O

He O
was O
followed O
by O
Rice B-PERSON
with O
the O
same O
tone O
and O
language O
during O
her O
last B-ORDINAL
meeting O
with O
her O
colleague O
the O
Zionist B-NORP
foreign O
minister O
where O
she O
criticized O
al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Maliki I-PERSON
, O
who O
is O
expected O
to O
be O
relieved O
of O
his O
post O
as O
another O
step O
to O
entice O
the O
Iraq B-GPE
's O
neighboring O
countries O
, O
specifically O
those O
who O
crave O
its O
budget O
surplus O
to O
spend O
it O
on O
their O
mistakes O
and O
adventures O
in O
power O
. O

They O
are O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
steps O
which O
find O
those O
who O
follow O
them O
, O
monitor O
them O
, O
scrutinize O
them O
, O
and O
document O
them O
in O
this O
article O
. O

Let O
us O
return O
once O
more O
to O
the O
accountability O
of O
ministries O
. O

By O
this O
means O
, O
we O
can O
hold O
companies O
accountable O
because O
we O
can O
not O
ask O
any O
particular O
ministry O
to O
monitor O
, O
hold O
to O
account O
, O
and O
make O
answerable O
the O
public O
and O
private O
companies O
. O

The O
ministry O
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
prosecution O
. O

If O
the O
condition O
of O
ministries O
is O
good O
, O
the O
condition O
of O
the O
companies O
that O
follow O
it O
will O
be O
good O
. O

This O
confirms O
that O
partnership O
between O
the O
public O
and O
private O
sectors O
which O
we O
are O
always O
demanding O
will O
not O
come O
into O
being O
unless O
we O
hold O
everyone O
accountable O
and O
all O
parties O
agree O
to O
serve O
the O
country O
with O
the O
instructions O
of O
the O
noble O
Book B-WORK_OF_ART
and O
the O
honored O
Sunna B-LAW
of I-LAW
the I-LAW
Prophet I-LAW
. O

In O
conclusion O
: O
It O
is O
now O
time O
to O
sit O
together O
at O
the O
table O
of O
the O
country O
. O

The O
heart O
of O
the O
country O
is O
wider O
than O
all O

places O
in O

Yes O

Saddam B-PERSON

was O
able O
to O
prove O
to O
the O
world O
the O
stupidity O
of O
the O
Rafida B-PERSON

Do O
n't O
you O
agree O
with O
me O
that O
the O
Safavid B-NORP
Rafida B-PERSON
revealed O
to O
the O
world O
their O
stupidity O
when O
they O
showed O
the O
Arabs B-NORP
in O
general O
, O
and O
the O
Sunnis B-NORP
in O
particular O
, O
their O
hidden O
hatred O
and O
limitless O
detestation O
, O
and O
revealed O
their O
dirty O
plans O
and O
policy O
. O

Yes O
, O
they O
are O
stupid O
because O
they O
revealed O
their O
true O
colors O
and O
proved O
to O
all O
Arabs B-NORP
that O
there O
are O
plans O
for O
major O
loathing O
and O
hatred O
for O
all O
the O
Sunnis B-NORP
in O
the O
world O
. O

Yes O
, O
they O
are O
stupid O
otherwise O
what O
is O
the O
benefit O
of O
executing O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
at O
this O
time O
? O

For O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
, O
there O
was O
no O
difference O
whether O
he O
was O
executed O
today B-DATE
or O
tomorrow B-DATE
or O
on O
a O
feast O
day O
or O
otherwise O
. O

Yes O
, O
they O
are O
stupid O
because O
they O
did O
not O
harm O
Saddam B-PERSON
but O
themselves O
, O
as O
they O
revealed O
their O
wickedness O
, O
their O
cunning O
and O
their O
coming O
danger O
and O
to O
all O
Moslems B-NORP
, O
Arabs B-NORP
and O
Sunnis B-NORP
. O

They O
were O
so O
ensconced O
in O
their O
deep O
hatred O
that O
they O
did O
not O
observe O
the B-DATE
holy I-DATE
months I-DATE
or O
at O

the O
rule O
of O

. O

Yes O
, O
they O
revealed O
to O
all O
the O
Arab B-NORP
peoples O
in O
Egypt B-GPE
, O
Saudi B-GPE
Arabia I-GPE

their O
treachery O

them O
. O

The O
idiots O
gained O
nothing O
but O
the O
hatred O
of O
the O
nations O
for O
them O
. O

Rather O
they O
made O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
a O
believing O
martyred O
hero O
. O

Why O
are O
we O
sad O
? O

Many O
Arabs B-NORP
did O
not O
like O
Saddam B-PERSON
and O
were O
not O
happy O
with O
many O
of O
his O
deeds O
, O
but O
after O
his O
execution O
in O
this O
way O
everybody O
sympathized O
with O
him O
. O

No O
one O
blames O
Saddam B-PERSON
for O
what O
he O
did O
with O
those O
traitors O
, O
sons O
of O
temporary O
marriages O
, O
Safavids B-NORP
, O
whose O
noses O
he O
rubbed O
in O
the O
ground O
. O

Yes O
, O
these O
traitors O
proved O
that O
no O
one O
but O
a O
ruler O
like O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
can O
make O
them O
act O
straight O
and O
control O
them O
. O

Why O
do O
we O
grieve O
for O
a O
man O
whose O
last B-ORDINAL
words O
were O
" O
I O
bear O
witness O
that O
there O
is O
no O
God O
but O
God O
and O
I O
bear O
witness O
that O
Muhammad B-PERSON
is O
the O

" O

All O
witnessed O
the O
execution O
of O
the O
genius O
brave O
leader O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
, O
and O
witnessed O
his O
bravery O
. O

Those O
Safavid B-NORP
Rafida B-PERSON
crowded O
together O
in O
front O
of O
him O
, O
cursing O
and O
mocking O
him O
as O
if O
they O
were O
children O
. O

But O
he O
stood O
pround O
and O
strong O
as O
we O
were O
used O
to O
him O
being O
. O

I O
swear O
by O
God O
if O
any O
of O
these O
traitors O
had O
been O
in O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
place O
you O
would O
have O
seen O
him O
weeping O
, O
begging O
or O
at O

fainting O
more O
than O
once O
. O

These O
idiots O
did O
not O
know O
that O
they O
had O
made O
a O
martyred O
, O
believing O
hero O
out O
of O
Saddam B-PERSON
. O

They O
only O
proved O
to O
the O
world O
his O
bravery O
and O
his O
might O
and O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
they O
proved O
to O
the O

their O
hidden O

and O
their O
lack O

on O
a O

the O

Why O
this O

and O

? O

Was O
n't O
there O
a O
sensible O
man O
amongst O
them O
? O

Yes O
, O
those O
Persian B-NORP
Safavids B-NORP
proved O
without O
doubt O
to O
the O
world O
that O
they O
do O
not O
use O
reason O
in O
their O
dealings O
, O
but O
that O
they O
deal O
in O
hate O
and O
loathing O
. O

Yes O
, O
those O
idiots O
proved O
that O
they O
are O
behind O
everything O
that O
is O
happening O
to O
the O
Sunnis B-NORP
in O
Iraq B-GPE
and O
all O
this O
is O
no O
one O

setup O
but O
theirs O
. O

Do O
n't O
those O
stupid O
traitor O
Safavid B-NORP
Rafida B-PERSON
collaborators O
know O
that O
they O
have O
not O
hurt O
Saddam B-PERSON
but O
themselves O
? O

For O
they O
proved O
to O
the O
world O
that O
they O
are O
a O
stupid O
people O
, O
a O
people O
of O
hate O
, O
a O
people O
who O
loath O
the O
Sunnis B-NORP
all O
over O
the O
world O
. O

We O
know O
that O
Saddam B-PERSON
was O
not O
ever O
a O
traitor O
or O
lackey O
but O
that O
he O
was O
a O
brave O
militant O
leader O
and O
died O
a O
martyr O
. O

We O
know O
that O
an O
offer O
was O
made O
to O
Saddam B-PERSON
to O
save O
his O
skin O
, O
leave O
Iraq B-GPE
and O
live O
as O
a O
political O
refugee O
in O
any O
state O
he O
wanted O
but O
he O
considered O
it O
a O
betrayal O
and O
continued O
struggling O
until O
he O
was O
martyred O
. O

We O
know O
the O
Americans B-NORP
offered O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
his O
release O
when O
a O
prisoner O
, O
to O
go O
to O
any O

he O
wished O
in O
return O
for O
stopping O
the O
Mujahideen B-PERSON
but O
he O
refused O
and O
considered O
it O
a O
betrayal O
. O

We O
know O
that O
whoever O
overthrew O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
was O
none O
other O
than O
your O
crusader O
masters O
and O
that O
you O
are O
too O
small O
to O
overthrow O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
, O
and O
that O
you O
are O
nothing O
but O
lackey O
traitor O
scum O
. O

We O
know O
that O
your O
hatred O
of O
your O
master O
and O
executioner O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
only O
comes O
from O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
is O
someone O
who O
knew O
how O
to O
keep O
you O
in O
check O
and O
trampled O
on O
your O
necks O
with O
his O

for O
more O
than O
thirty B-CARDINAL

That O
's O
why O
all O

do O
not O

and O

.. O
I O
was O
late O

entering O
a O
comment O
,, O

We O
tell O
al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Maliki I-PERSON
.. O
The O
execution O
of O
Saddam B-PERSON
is O
not O
an O
internal O
matter O
.. O

Those O
who O
overthrew O
his O
regime O
and O
arrested O
him O
are O
the O
armies O
of O
the O
coalition O
, O
and O
not O
the O
army O
of O
the O
government O
of O
al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Hakim I-PERSON
and O
Muqtada B-PERSON
. O

Thus O
the O
debate O
on O
the O
issue O
of O
his O
execution O
and O
his O
trial O
should O
have O
been O
an O
international O
matter O
for O
which O
an O
international O
court O
was O
formed O
.. O

Even O
the O
moderates O
among O
the O
American B-NORP
politicians O
have O
stated O
so O
.. O

Anyway O
.. O
al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Maliki I-PERSON
.. O
knows O
the O
disgraceful O
situation O
over O
which O
he O
presides O
.. O

After O
his O
ratification O
of O
the O
implementation O
of O
Saddam B-PERSON
's O
death O
sentence O
.. O
he O
sensed O
the O
danger O
and O
fear O
of O
what O
he O
had O
done O
, O
which O
al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Hakim I-PERSON
and O
Muqtada B-PERSON
had O
involved O
him O
in O
, O
and O
behind O
them O
the O
Safavids B-NORP
. O

In O
a O
press O
interview O
conducted O
with O
him O
immediately O
after O
the O
ratification O
, O
he O
expressed O
the O
wish O
that O
his O
tenure O
would O
end O
soon O
and O
that O
he O
would O
not O
accept O
renewal O
. O

The O
bitter O
truth O
is O
that O
.. O
this O
government O
came O
through O
a O
forged O
legitimate O
way O
.. O
whose O
mask O
will O
be O
revealed O
in O

God O
is O

the O

her O
sole O

The O
sources O
added O
that O
when O

the O

the O

Khobar I-GPE

The O
surprise O
was O
the O

In O

of O
the O

Officials O
in O
the O

Khobar I-GPE
were O
embarrassed O
by O
the O

of O
the O

While O
the O
law O

about O
the O

this O

The O
posting O
of O
the O
article O
revealed O
other O
aspects O
. O

He O
published O
copies O
of O
legal O
documents O
because O
he O
wanted O
to O
use O
them O
to O
prove O
that O
the O
issue O
was O
not O
based O
on O
inequality O
in O
lineage O
, O
but O
that O
it O
was O
related O
to O
behavioral O
aspects O
of O
the O
man O
, O

foremost O
among O
them O
is O
desertion O
and O
abandonment O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

Now O
the O
newspapers O
, O
which O
I O
do O
not O
trust O
, O
still O
declare O
that O
inequality O
in O
lineage O
is O
the O
reason O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
talk O
is O
circulating O
among O
people O
about O
this O
issue O
, O
because O
accepting O
the O
notion O
of O
the O
possibility O
of O
separating O
a O
wife O
from O
her O
husband O
by O
a O
decision O
outside O
the O
relationship O
-LRB- O
or O
even O
inside O
it O
-RRB- O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
disparity O
in O
the O
relative O
streams O
is O
a O
matter O
that O
robs O
the O
society O
of O
sleep O
and O
causes O
an O
exploding O
moral O
and O
social O
crisis O
which O
will O
have O
no O
end O
. O

If O
what O
was O
previously O
published O
in O
the O

is O
true O
, O
that O
the O
man O
was O
separated O
from O
her O
for O
other O

, O
that O
would O
be O
reassuring O

ِAnyway O
, O
transforming O
tradition O
and O
calling O
ignorance O
a O
legitimate O
basis O
for O
a O
verdict O
in O
a O
certain O

is O
a O

which O
can O
not O
be O
accepted O
, O
believed O
, O
or O
trusted O
to O
be O
connected O
with O
Sharia B-WORK_OF_ART
. O

Sharia B-WORK_OF_ART
is O
unequivocal O
and O
straightforward O
. O

No O
one O
was O
forced O
to O
accept O
and O
consent O
to O
any O
marriage O
. O

The O
glorious O
legislator O
would O
not O
have O
placed O
the O
decision O
of O
matrimony O
in O
the O
hand O
of O
the O
guardian O
and O
put O
conditions O
on O
it O
, O
and O
facilitate O
a O
legitimate O
alternative O
for O
him O
in O
case O
of O
his O
absence O
, O
unless O
the O
decision O
was O
final O
. O

Then O
would O
someone O
come O
afterwards O
to O
annul O
this O
and O
lean O
on O
the O
-LRB- O
Revelation B-WORK_OF_ART
-RRB- O
in O
such O
a O
thing O
??? O

As O
I O
said O
: O
if O
it O
was O
true O
that O
equality O
in O
lineage O
was O
the O
reason O
for O
the O
separation O

may O

The O

with O

that O
they O

That O

why O
we O

impertinently O

The O
case O

was O
exploited O
by O
our O

which O
is O
controlled O
by O
the O
pretenders O

and O
tarnish O
its O
image O

The O
judge O
who O
tried O
this O

when O
he O
based O
his O
verdict O
on O
the O
benefit O

harm O
resulting O
from O
the O
continuance O
of O
this O

There O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
many O
sympathize O
with O
this O
woman O

and O
I O
am O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
. O

But O
there O
are O
other O
girls O
in O
her O
tribe O
who O
are O
not O
married O

It O
is O
our O
duty O
to O
sympathize O
with O
their O
tragedy O
when O

shun O
them O
. O

If O
the O
pretenders O
of O

who O
undertook O
the O
defense O
of O
this O

have O
one B-CARDINAL
atom O

they O
would O
have O

the O

of O
this O
lying O
and O
deceitful O
husband O
who O
was O
exposed O
by O
his O
first B-ORDINAL
wife O
. O

But O
as O
usual O
they O
do O
not O
know O
credibility O
. O

Rather O
it O
is O
incredibility O
as O
long O
as O
the O
margin O
of O
freedom O
available O

them O

criticize O
our O

for O

attorney O
, O
Abd B-PERSON
al I-PERSON

Lahim I-PERSON
, O
this O
means O
that O
the O

is O
closed O
as O
far O
as O
the O
judicial O
aspect O
is O
concerned O
unless O
new O
and O

I O

or O
to O

in O

There O
is O
total O
respect O
for O
and O
confidence O
in O
the O

of O
the O
judiciary O
. O

But O
what O
I O
would O
like O
to O
refer O
to O
in O
connection O
with O
this O
issue O
has O
to O
do O
with O
the O
necessity O
of O
educating O
people O
about O
equality O
of O
lineage O
in O
marriage O
before O
one O
finds O
oneself O
involved O
in O
the O
same O
fate O
as O
that O
of O
Fatima B-PERSON
and O
Mansour B-PERSON
. O

There O
is O
a O
large O
portion O
of O
people O
who O
get O
married O
without O
keeping O
in O
mind O
- O
out O
of O
ignorance O
- O
this O
issue O
, O
which O
can O
threaten O
their O
family O
life O
at O
any O
moment O
when O
a O
member O
of O
the O
wife O
's O
family O
objects O
to O
the O
lineage O
of O
the O
husband O
. O

I O
declare O
that O
I O
have O
attended O
many O
marriage O
ceremonies O
during O
my O
lifetime O
. O

But O
I O
do O
not O
remember O
even O
one B-CARDINAL
marriage O
official O
who O
brought O
up O
this O
issue O
by O
asking O
the O
groom O
about O
his O
lineage O
before O
finalizing O
the O
contract O
. O

He O
ought O
to O
have O
done O
so O
as O
long O
as O
this O
issue O
has O
such O
a O
level O
of O
consideration O
. O

It O
can O
threaten O
the O
family O
life O
of O
the O
bride O
and O
groom O
at O
any O
future O
moment O
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
educational O
and O
religious O
institutions O
in O
the O
country O
are O
obliged O
socially O
to O
educate O
the O
society O
in O
a O
more O
profound O
way O
. O

There O
is O
no O
stronger O
evidence O
of O
the O
ignorance O
by O
a O
large O
sector O
of O
the O
possibility O
of O
separation O
because O
of O
inequality O
in O
lineage O
than O
the O
social O
debate O
stirred O
up O
by O
this O
issue O
, O
which O
was O
not O
limited O
to O
the O
common O
people O
but O
extended O
to O
writers O
, O
cultured O
people O
, O
and O
lawyers O
, O
foremost O
among O
them O
the O

issued O
a O

the O

would O
continue O
to O
stick O
to O
his O
position O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
verdict O
that O
was O

Maybe O
it O
is O
also O
the O
duty O
of O
our O

Assuming O

the O

prefer O

what O

there O

The O

a O

that O

Speaking O
of O
the O
Riyadh B-GPE

, O
Prince O

said O
that O

Prince O
Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Waleed I-PERSON
reported O
that O
he O
had O
previously O
mentioned O
that O
the O
market O
was O
facing O
danger O
some B-DATE
five I-DATE
months I-DATE
prior O
to O
its O
collapse O
last B-DATE
February I-DATE
, O
pointing O
out O
that O
when O
the O
stock O
market O
surpassed O
the O
20 B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
points O
, O
that O
was O
exaggerated O
and O
illogical O
because O
the O
Price O
Earnings O
Ratio O
in O
some O
companies O
were O
reaching O
a B-MONEY
thousand I-MONEY
riyals I-MONEY
and O
that O
was O
not O
possible O
. O

That O
collapse O
was O
expected O
, O
not O
to O
mention O
the O
speculation O
that O
occurred O
. O

With O
the O
revival O
of O
the O
petro-market O
and O
the O
increase O
in O
the O
Kingdom B-GPE
's O
revenue O
, O
both O
of O
the O
government O
or O
the O
citizens O
, O
there O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
and O
limited O
investment O
opportunities O
, O

so O
inflation O
occurred O
, O
leading O
to O
the O
collapse O
and O
not O
a O
single O
Saudi B-NORP
family O
escaped O
being O
hit O
. O

Even O
in O
the O
current O
market O
situation O
, O
if O
we O
compare O
to O
the O
Price O
Earning O
Ratio O
then O
it O
is O
still O
logical O
and O
realistic O
, O

He O
pointed O
out O
that O
current O
share O
prices O
were O
logical O
and O
reasonable O
. O
and O
demanded O
investors O
stop O
speculating O
because O
that O
leads O
to O
many O
bankruptcies O
. O

He O
said O
that O
there O
are O
companies O
on O
the O
market O
in O
which O
profit O
potential O
was O
nonexistent O
. O

He O
applauded O
the O
decision O
of O
the B-ORG
Capital I-ORG
Market I-ORG
Authority I-ORG
to O
suspend O
dealings O
of O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
companies O
and O
said O
that O
it O
was O
a O
wise O
decision O
but O
it O
had O
come O
too O
late O
as O
there O
were O
fears O
from O
speculators O
of O
suspending O
the O
shares O
of O
other O
companies O
, O
and O
this O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
state O
's O
rights O
, O
to O
suspend O
dealing O
in O
the O
shares O
of O
companies O
that O
were O
hopeless O
. O

He O
indicated O
that O
there O
might O
be O
other O
companies O
whose O
shares O
will O
be O
suspended O
and O
that O
investors O
should O
buy O
into O
companies O
that O
, O
it O
was O
hoped O
, O
would O
remain O
and O
continue O
. O

Speaking O
of O
the O
timing O
of O
this O
announcement O
and O
the O
reasons O
for O
it O
, O
Prince O
Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Waleed I-PERSON
said O
that O
the O
undertaking O
to O
pump O
10 B-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
riyals I-MONEY
into O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
market O
was O
made O
last B-DATE
March I-DATE
and O
that O
the O
investment O
he O
had O
undertaken O
was O
not O
completed O
till O
two B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
ago I-DATE
and O
therefore O
it O
was O
being O
announced O
. O

He O
hoped O
that O
the O
market O
had O
hit O
the O
bottom O
but O
without O
any O
mad O
rises O
as O
had O
happened O
in O
the O
past O
, O
as O
they O
were O
short O
- O
term O
paper O
profits O
. O

He O
expected O
that O
the O
current O
year O
would O
witness O
the O
restoration O
of O
equilibrium O
to O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
market O
after O
reaching O
a O
kind O
of O
sensibility O
. O

He O
explained O
that O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
authorities O
were O
insistent O
on O
driving O
out O
the O
speculators O
who O
were O
pushing O
the O
market O
into O
harming O
them O
and O
the O
small O
investors O
. O

He O
pointed O
out O
that O
the O
market O
is O
looking O
for O
a O
bottom O
to O
hit O
thereafter O
to O
be O
able O
to O
rise O
in O
a O
logical O
and O
reasonable O
way O

He O
indicated O
that O
the O
market O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
bottom O
at O
7000 B-CARDINAL
points O
or O
slightly O
less O
. O

He O
added O
: O
" O
We O
do O
not O
want O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
stock O
market O
to O
return O
to O
insane O
and O
unacceptable O
figures O
as O
it O
did O
in O
the O
past O
the B-ORG
Kingdom I-ORG
Holding I-ORG
Company I-ORG
is O
investing O
in O
the O
market O
to O
restore O
confidence O
in O
it O
. O

More O
importantly O
, O
the O
investor O
must O
be O
educated O
to O
invest O
in O
companies O
that O
have O
a O
good O
future O
. O
" O

Prince O
Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Waleed I-PERSON
confirmed O
that O
the B-ORG
Kingdom I-ORG
Holding I-ORG
Company I-ORG
is O
continuing O
with O
its O
plans O
to O
list O
for O
sale O
a O
percentage O
of O
its O
shares O
agreed O
upon O
with O
the O
state O
, O
to O
reach O
a O
figure O
that O
serves O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
citizen O
and O
does O
not O
harm O
the O
future O
interests O
of O
the O
Company B-ORG
and O
its O
expansions O
. O

He O
stressed O
that O
even O
in O
the O
current O
market O
conditions O
the O
company O
would O
be O
listing O
its O
shares O
on O
the O
market O
in O
the B-DATE
current I-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

Speaking O
of O
the O
downturn O
on O
the O
stock O
market O
in O
light O
of O
the O
increasing O
petroleum O
revenues O
and O
the O
record O
budget O
achieved O
by O
the O
state O
during O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
two I-DATE
financial I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
Prince O
Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Waleed I-PERSON
said O
that O
the O
stock O
market O
is O
a O
mirror O
of O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
economy O
. O
but O
if O
the O
stock O
market O
was O
exaggerated O
then O
there O
would O
be O
a O
difference O
between O
the O
state O
of O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
market O
in O
general O
and O
the O
stock O
market O
and O
this O
is O
what O
happened O
. O

He O
offered O
a O
number O
of O
suggestions O
to O
the B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
of I-ORG
Finance I-ORG
and O
officials O
to O
help O
the O
companies O
, O
namely O
: O
to O
allow O
companies O
to O
buy O
their O
shares O
immediately O
which O
would O
give O
trust O
in O
the O
market O
and O
would O
reduce O
the O
number O
of O
dealt O
in O
shares O
on O
the O
market O
and O
thus O
increase O
the O
amount O
of O
profit O
; O
to O
allow O
non-Saudi B-NORP
companies O
and O
corporations O
to O
enter O
the O
market O
by O
placing O
controls O
such O
as O
instituting O
sectors O
for O
shares O
and O
an O
ownership O
percentage O
ceiling O
; O
and O
to O
oblige O
companies O
to O
disclose O
future O
expectations O
of O
the O
companies O
' O
performances O
. O

A O
discussion O
with O
the O
CEOs O
of O
Saudi B-NORP
companies O
has O
been O
initiated O
by O
the B-ORG
Kingdom I-ORG
Holding I-ORG
Company I-ORG
by O
sending O
them O
letters O
dealing O
with O
the O
disclosure O
of O
the O
companies O
' O
future O
expectations O
. O

This O
is O
done O
by O
all O
companies O
in O
the O
developed O
world O
with O
the O
aim O
of O
obliging O
the O
company O
to O
achieve O
the O
declared O
profit O
or O
something O
close O
to O
it O
and O
to O
re-assure O
the O
investor O
. O

Finally O
, O
more O
disclosures O
between O
the O
company O
and O
the O
investor O
, O
since O
there O
are O
companies O
with O
specific O
profit O
achieving O
strategies O
not O
from O
its O
basic O
accredited O
activities O
, O
such O
as O
achieving O
non-repeatable O
profit O
. O

He O
added O
: O
" O
We O
wish O
to O
remove O
the O
weak O
companies O
that O
do O
not O
represent O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
economy O
from O
the O
market O
and O
separate O
them O
from O
the O
companies O
with O
big O
profits O
. O
" O

He O
confirmed O
that O
these O
proposals O
would O
be O
made O
to O
state O
officials O
to O
be O
applied O
to O
companies O
. O

Prince O
Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Waleed I-PERSON
denied O
that O
the B-ORG
Kingdom I-ORG
Holding I-ORG
Company I-ORG
had O
liquidized O
any O
portfolio O
it O
had O
in O
the O
Kingdom B-GPE
, O

but O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
it O
had O
increased O
its O
investments O
in O
a O
number O
of O
companies O
, O
and O
in O
addition O
did O
not O
enter O
into O
any O
speculation O
at O
all O
but O
is O
working O
on O
buying O
and O
keeping O
for O
investment O
. O

He O
also O
denied O
that O
the O
collapse O
of O
last B-DATE
February I-DATE
was O
planned O
by O
any O
party O
, O
but O
it O
rather O
occurred O
because O
of O
the O
illogical O
prices O
reached O
by O
the O
market O
. O

He O
indicated O
that O
the O
collapse O
was O
expected O
because O
of O
the O
inflation O
in O
share O
prices O
and O
said O
that O
any O
person O
familiar O
with O
the O
stock O
market O
will O
confirm O
that O
the O
collapse O
was O
imminent O
at O
that O
time O
. O

He O
explained O
that O
the O
state O
could O
not O
in O
any O
way O
be O
made O
responsible O
for O
the O
losses O
of O
investors O
on O
the O
market O
and O
must O
remain O
neutral O
on O
that O
. O

The O
role O
of O
the O
state O
is O
to O
prevent O
the O
manipulators O
from O
exposing O
the O
market O
to O
fluctuations O
, O
to O
punish O
them O
and O
to O
suspend O
bankrupt O
companies O
. O

He O
pointed O
out O
that O
there O
is O
a O
study O
on O
dividing O
the O
market O
because O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
place O
profitable O
, O
strong O
companies O
alongside O
weak O
loss O
- O
making O
ones O
, O
and O
this O
is O
where O
the B-ORG
Capital I-ORG
Market I-ORG
Authority I-ORG
plays O
a O
role O
. O

He O
called O
upon O
the O
investors O
and O
not O
the O
experience O
lacking O
speculators O
in O
the O
market O
, O
to O
go O
to O
investment O
funds O
and O
banks O
to O
invest O
their O
finances O
in O
a O
professional O
manner O
, O
so O
as O
to O
avoid O
getting O
caught O
in O
market O
fluctuations O
and O
become O
exposed O
to O
losses O
. O

As O
for O
the O
stagnation O
in O
Saudi B-NORP
economy O
, O
it O
is O
not O
probable O
, O
because O
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
and O
at O
the O
peak O
of O
the O
stock O
market O
collapse O
, O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
economy O
flourished O
and O
achieved O
a O
6 B-PERCENT
per I-PERCENT
cent I-PERCENT
growth O
, O
because O
there O
is O
a O
difference O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
economy O
and O
that O
of O
the O
stock O
market O
. O

He O
asserted O
that O

there O
will O
be O
no O
stagnation O
in O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
economy O
during O
the B-DATE
current I-DATE

due O

especially O
in O

strong O
steps O
taken O
by O
the O

to O
not O
to O
concentrate O

competition O
for O
the O

that O
they O

an O

with O
the B-ORG

to O

He O

Prince O

Waleed I-PERSON
explained O
that O
pumping O

taken O
more O
time O
than O
anticipated O

but O
confirmed O
that O
it O
was O
not O

rather O
for O

. O

the O
relevant O
state O
authorities O
have O
been O
informed O

these O

Months B-DATE

Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Waleed I-PERSON
declared O
the O
pumping O
of O
ten B-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
riyals I-MONEY
and O
specified O
companies O
that O
were O
" O
respectable O
" O
according O
to O
his O
claim O
. O

He O
won O
the O
confidence O
of O
some O
and O
small O
speculators O
entered O
the O
market O
, O
whereupon O
an O
artificial O
surge O
occurred O
, O
then O
they O
were O
caught O
in O
the O
collapses O
which O
followed O
that O
made O
- O
up O
surge O
and O
which O
have O
continued O
until O
today B-DATE
. O

Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Waleed I-PERSON
had O
lost O
his O
credibility O
on O
the O
market O
. O

He O
had O
to O
change O
his O
rhetoric O
if O
he O
wanted O
to O
restore O
his O
credibility O
in O
order O
to O
continue O
his O
mission O
of O
beating O
the O
market O
-LRB- O
as O
some O
believe O
-RRB- O
. O

Thus O
he O
had O
to O
specify O
in O
his O
present O
statement O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
names O
of O
the O
companies O
, O
the O
percentage O
he O
owns O
in O
each O
company O
-LRB- O
more B-PERCENT

Speaking O
of O
the O
timing O
of O
this O
announcement O
and O
the O
reasons O
for O
it O
, O
Prince O
Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Waleed I-PERSON
said O
that O
the O
undertaking O
to O
pump O
10 B-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
riyals I-MONEY
into O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
market O
was O
made O
last B-DATE
March I-DATE
. O
and O
that O
the O
investment O
he O
had O
undertaken O
was O
not O
completed O
till O
two B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
ago I-DATE
and O
therefore O
it O
was O
being O
announced O
. O

It O
is O
not O
possible O
to O
believe O
that O
Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Waleed I-PERSON
had O
been O
" O
only O
" O
collecting O
since B-DATE
last I-DATE
March I-DATE
-LRB- I-DATE
almost I-DATE
a I-DATE
year I-DATE
ago I-DATE
-RRB- I-DATE
until I-DATE
now I-DATE
. O
Because O
, O
if O
that O
had O
happened O
, O
then O
the O
rates O
of O
his O
prices O
would O
be O
much O
higher O
than O
the O
current O
prices O
. O

This O
would O
be O
unreasonable O
behavior O
from O
an O
opportunist O
like O
Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Waleed I-PERSON
. O

And O
so O
this O
explanation O
of O
his O
is O
untruthful O
. O

" O
He O
expected O
that O
the B-DATE
current I-DATE
year I-DATE
would O
witness O
the O
restoration O
of O
equilibrium O
to O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
market O
after O
reaching O
a O
kind O
of O
sensibility O
. O
" O

This O
expression O
seems O
to O
have O
two B-CARDINAL
sides O
to O
it O
: O

the O
first B-ORDINAL
is O
to O
send O
a O
signal O
to O
the B-ORG
Market I-ORG
Authority I-ORG
that O
he O
does O
not O
want O
to O
create O
a O
very O
strong O
imaginary O
surge O

and O
this O
might O
mean O
that O
the B-ORG
Market I-ORG
Authority I-ORG
is O
being O
informed O
that O
he O
will O
be O
satisfied O
with O
less O
profit O
than O
his O
-LRB- O
counterpart O
-RRB- O
and O
then O
get O
out O
. O

The O
second B-ORDINAL
: O
to O
win O
the O
dealers O
' O
belief O
that O
the O
market O
might O
have O
hit O
the O
bottom O
and O
that O
they O
should O
safely O
enter O
with O
their O
cash O
and O
begin O
raising O
its O
index O
. O

" O
He O
explained O
that O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
authorities O
were O
insistent O
on O
driving O
out O
the O
speculators O
who O
were O
pushing O
the O
market O
into O
harming O
them O
and O
the O
small O
investors O
. O
" O

In O
this O
clause O
of O
the O
statement O
he O
is O
assuring O
the O
minds O
of O
dealers O
that O
does O
not O
intend O
to O
dispose O
of O
his O
shares O
to O
them O
through O
this O
action O
of O
his O
, O
and O
so O
they O
should O
enter O
and O
raise O
up O
the O
index O
of O
his O
companies O
. O

" O
the B-ORG
Kingdom I-ORG
Holding I-ORG
Company I-ORG
is O
investing O
in O
the O
market O
to O
restore O
confidence O
in O
it O
. O
" O

And O
" O
more O
importantly O
, O
the O
investor O
must O
be O
educated O
to O
invest O
in O
companies O
that O
have O
a O
good O
future O
. O
" O

Here O
Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Waleed I-PERSON
confirms O
sowing O
of O
trust O
in O
the O
hearts O
of O
speculators O
but O
only O
if O
they O
enter O
and O
give O
a O
boost O
to O
his O
companies O
. O

That O
's O
why O
he O
finished O
by O
saying O
" O
educating O
the O
investor O
" O

It O
is O
the O
pinnacle O
of O
education O
when O
the O
speculators O
enter O
into O
Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Waleed I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
companies O
and O
get O
stuck O

The O
talk O
about O
the O
driving O
of O
cars O
by O
women O
took O
up O
a O
space O
greater O

existing O
between O

every B-DATE

called O
" O
the B-WORK_OF_ART
Car I-WORK_OF_ART
Club I-WORK_OF_ART
. O
" O

Each O
issue O
includes O
an O
interview O
with O
a O
young O
athlete O
, O
actor O
or O
singer O
, O
who O
talks O
about O
his O
personal O
relationship O
with O
the O
car O
. O

Each O
interview O
ends O
with O
a O
final O
question O
: O
" O
What O
is O
your O
opinion O
about O
women O
driving O
cars O
? O
" O

In O
fact O
, O
I O
was O
not O
expecting O
those O
answers O
from O
those O
people O
who O
are O
not O
exactly O
- O
in O
my O
opinion O
- O
classified O
as O
intellectuals O
or O
people O
holding O
ideologies O
, O
but O
rather O
are O
common O
people O
. O

I O
was O
not O
expecting O
those O
answers O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
intensive O
pressure O
and O
the O
attack O
launched O
by O
our O
local O
press O
, O
which O
has O
a O
bias O
for O
the O
liberal O
current O
, O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
endorse O
women O
driving O
. O

I O
believe O
it O
is O
not O
love O
and O
concern O
for O
women O
as O
much O
as O
this O
decision O
is O
the O
dream O
to O
pave O
the O
way O
for O
other O
horizons O
and O
projects O
to O
liberate O
women O
and O
walk O
on O
the O
path O
of O
westernization O
. O

Our O
attempt O
, O
as O
conservatives O
, O
to O
stand O
up O
against O
issues O
such O
as O
these O
must O
not O
be O
satisfied O
with O
only O
the O
fatwas O
of O
important O
scholars O
, O
but O
we O
must O
employ O
other O
means O
. O

I O
liked O
one B-CARDINAL
cartoonist O
who O
depicted O
the O
situation O
of O
a O
woman O
in O
her O
car O
while O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
tires O
failed O
, O
and O
how O
a O
young O
man O
came O
to O
rescue O
her O
. O

Above O
his O
head O
hearts O
of O
love O
and O
infatuation O
were O
drawn O
. O

This O
cartoonist O
supported O
the O
issue O
with O
his O
brush O
and O
depicted O
how O
danger O
lurks O
if O
it O
is O
endorsed O
. O

Now O
we O
are O
in O
need O
of O
such O
ideas O
more O
than O
we O
need O
rhetorical O
speeches O
that O
people O
are O
fed O
up O
with O
. O

Since O
I O
think O
that O
publishing O
the O
statements O
made O
by O
athletes O
, O
actors O
, O
and O
singers O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
way O
to O
help O
us O
to O
serve O
this O
cause O
, O
and O
since O
these O
interviews O
came O
through O
the O
newspaper O
Al B-ORG
- I-ORG
Jazirah I-ORG
, O
I O
think O
that O
if O
they O
had O
been O
published O
by O
the O
newspaper O
Al B-ORG
- I-ORG
Watan I-ORG
or O
Al B-ORG
- I-ORG
Riyadh I-ORG
they O
would O
have O
stopped O
this O
question O
from O
being O
asked O
to O
the O
guest O
because O
they O
are O
known O
for O
their O
banning O
of O
the O
other O
and O
they O
do O
not O
know O
neutrality O
when O
exposing O
and O
they O
do O
not O
like O
these O
answers O
. O
As O
it O
happened O
with O
the O
newspaper O
Al B-ORG
- I-ORG
Riyadh I-ORG
when O
it O
halted O
and O
concealed O
the O
poll O
on O
women O
driving O
as O
it O
saw O
the O
overwhelming O
victory O
of O

those O
opposed O
. O

I O
leave O
you O
with O
the O
answers O
of O
the O
Car B-WORK_OF_ART
Club I-WORK_OF_ART
magazine O
guests O
to O
see O
that O
there O
is O
not O
one B-CARDINAL

who O
explicitly O
agreed O
without O
mentioning O

regulations O

I O

I O
was O
not O

of O
what O
fate O
was O
hiding O
. O

On O
Monday B-DATE
afternoon I-DATE
on I-DATE
13/12/1425 I-DATE
A. I-DATE
H. I-DATE
, O
I O
went O
with O
my O
father O
and O
my O
eldest O
son O
to O
the B-ORG
Majid I-ORG
Organization I-ORG
to O
sell O
construction O
materials O
. O
Since O
my O
father O
is O
building O
a O
villa O
that O
belongs O
to O
me O
. O

After O
we O
left O
the O
organization O
, O
we O
found O
a O
number O
of O
security O
men O
standing O
by O
my O
father O
's O
car O
. O

When O
I O
asked O
them O
, O
they O
said O
that O
the O
car O
was O
wanted O
. O

So O
my O
father O
ordered O
me O
to O
go O
in O
the O
car O
with O
them O
. O

My O
father O
took O
the O
child O
to O
his O
home O
. O

At O
the O
police O
station O
I O
found O
a O
captain O
named O
Butayhan B-PERSON
Munir I-PERSON
who O
ordered O
that O
I O
be O
arrested O
without O
asking O
me O
any O
questions O
. O

I O
objected O
to O
that O
asking O
for O
information O
on O
why O
my O
father O
's O
car O
had O
been O
taken O
and O
the O
reasons O
for O
my O
arrest O
. O

At O
this O
, O
the O
captain O
said O
" O
your O
father O
's O
car O
has O
been O
reported O
. O
" O

I O
asked O
to O
see O
the O
report O
and O
I O
found O
that O
it O
was O
for O
a O
98 B-DATE
or I-DATE
99 I-DATE
model O
car O
without O
a O
plate O
number O
. O

I O
explained O
to O
the O
captain O
and O
informed O
him O
that O
my O
father O
's O
car O
is O
a O
2002 B-DATE
model O
and O
its O
plates O
are O
on O
it O
. O

At O
this O
, O
the O
captain O
said O
that O
it O
was O
reported O
by O
a O
Sudanese B-NORP
. O

Upon O
reviewing O
the O
report O
of O
the O
Sudanese B-NORP
I O
found O
that O
it O
was O
about O
a O
car O
whose O
model O
and O
plate O
number O
were O
not O
specified O
. O

But O
the O
captain O
insisted O
on O
his O
position O
and O
quarreled O
with O
me O
and O
put O
me O
into O
detention O
. O

At O
this O
, O
a O
call O
was O
made O
to O
the O
governor O
of O
Wadi B-GPE

Dawasir I-GPE
by O
my O
uncle O

" O

my O

thinking O
that O
he O
was O
at O
the O
Wadi B-LOC
, O
and O
an O
argument O
took O
place O
with O
him O
. O

He O
called O
the O
captain O
and O
told O
him O
to O
put O
him O
into O
the O
cell O
and O
exert O
pressure O
on O
him O
till O
he O
confesses O
. O
Because O
they O
will O
raise O
a O
complaint O
against O
us O
, O
if O
his O
detention O
was O
without O
reason O
. O

That O
evening O
after O
sunset O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
received O
the O
phone O
call O
from O
the O
governor O
, O
the O
captain O
took O
me O
out O
of O
the O

He O
asked O
me O
to O
enter O
the O

beat O
me O
with O
the O
assistance O
of O
the O

I O
slapped O
Captain O

The O
captain O
stood O
up O

lit O

and O
said O
, O
I O
will O
put O
it O
out O
in O
your O

I O
said O
, O
you O
can O
not O
. O

He O
took O
me O
into O
a O
dark O

with O
no O
water O

I O
did O
not O

it O

the O
monarchy O
, O
which O
require O
the O
interrogation O
of O

. O

As O
soon O
as O
the O
captain O
received O
the O
order O
of O
the O
governor O
, O
everyone O
coordinated O
with O
Lieutenant O
Colonel O
'Id O
Matar O
al O
- O
Nafi'i O
to O
bring O
his O
relative O
, O
the O
aforementioned O
person O
who O
filed O
the O
report O
. O

They O
called O
him O
after O
sunset O
that O
night O
. O

He O
was O
in O
Khamis B-GPE
Mashit I-GPE
. O

They O
asked O
him O
to O
come O
to O
them O
immediately O
because O
the O
reported O
car O
had O
been O
seized O
. O
And O
the O
reported O
person O
had O
been O
arrested O

So O
he O
went O
quickly O

as O
he O
was O
told O
to O
do O

At O
one B-TIME
o'clock I-TIME

" O

The O
detainees O
were O
awakened O
. O

He O
took O
me O
out O
of O
my O
cell O
and O
they O
brought O
their O
puppet O
veiled O
so O
he O
would O
not O
be O
recognized O
, O
because O
he O
knew O
that O
he O
was O
playing O
a O
nasty O
role O
. O

He O
said O
hastily O
" O
the O
one O
in O
the O
green O
garment O
, O
" O
and O
they O
wrote O
down O
what O
they O
called O
an O
identification O
statement O
, O
which O
was O
nothing O
more O
than O
an O
allegation O
, O
if O
it O
were O
separated O
from O
all O
the O
conspiracy O
and O
fabrication O
that O
was O
obvious O
from O
the O
context O
of O
the O
story O
. O

The O
conspirators O
felt O
confident O
with O
their O
plot O
. O

A B-DATE
week I-DATE
later I-DATE
I O
was O
interrogated O
. O

I O
denied O
everything O
I O
had O
been O
charged O
with O
. O

Then O
they O
showed O
me O
to O
the O
Sudanese B-NORP
people O
who O
cleared O
me O
. O

They O
showed O
them O
my O
father O

car O
and O
they O
said O
it O
was O
not O
the O
one O
. O

Then O
came O
two B-CARDINAL
witnesses O
who O
were O
watching O
the O
chase O
between O
the O
car O
mentioned O
in O
the O

The O

They O
testified O
that O
the O

with O
which O
he O
had O
competed O
was O
a O
98 B-DATE
model O
, O
according O
to O
his O
report O

They O
showed O
them O
my O
father O

car O
and O
they O
testified O
that O
it O
was O
not O
the O
car O
they O

so O
they O
released O
me O

We O
complained O

hoping O
that O
the O

be O
held O

and O
the O
dignity O

would O
be O
preserved O

The O
following O
is O
noteworthy O
: O

1. O
Lieutenant O
Colonel O
'Id O
Matar O
refused O
to O
appear O
before O
it O
. O

His O
testimony O
was O
through O
the O
statement O
of O
the O
chief O
of O
police O
that O

3. O
Captain O
Butayhan B-PERSON
and O
his O
other O
colleagues O
refused O
to O
appear O
together O
. O

They O
insisted O
that O
the O
first B-ORDINAL

come O
, O
and O
then O
return O
to O
the O
police O
station O
, O
then O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
one O
would O
come O
, O
and O
so O
on O
, O
so O
they O
could O
coordinate O
their O
answers O
. O

4. O
The O
committee O
acceded O
to O
their O
wishes O
despite O
our O
objection O
. O

5. O
The O
committee O
refused O
to O
let O
us O
see O
any O
of O
the O
documents O
of O
the O
proceedings O
and O
the O
charges O
filed O
against O
us O
. O

6. O
The O
committee O
refused O
the O
request O
to O
impound O
the O
car O
of O
the O
reporter O
to O
confirm O
the O
truth O
about O
its O
collision O
and O
where O
exactly O
it O
was O
, O
especially O
since O
the O
documents O
of O
the O
proceedings O
are O
devoid O
of O
anything O
that O
proves O
that O
or O
proves O
that O
there O
was O
an O
accident O
, O
as O
the O
reporter O
alleged O

7. O
The O
committee O
refused O

reporter O
where O
he O
fixed O
the O
alleged O
damage O
to O
his O
car O
, O
or O
in O
what O
workshop O

Did O
he O
fix O
it O
in O
accordance O
with O
an O
official O
repair O
document O
according O
to O
the O
system O
, O
or O
not O
? O

Did O
he O
know O
who O
gave O
him O
the O
repair O
document O
? O

If O
he O
was O
given O
a O
document O
, O
the O
question O
is O
who O
gave O
it O
to O
him O
in O
violation O
of O
the O
system O
? O

8. O
The O
committee O
refused O
to O
discuss O
with O
the O
conspirators O
and O
the O
investigator O
whether O
they O
referred O
the O
car O
of O
the O
reporter O
to O
three B-CARDINAL
workshops O
for O
estimates O
, O
in O
compliance O
with O
the O
rules O
. O

And O
why O
did O
n't O
they O
do O
so O
, O
if O
they O
were O
telling O
the O
truth O
? O
Especially O
since O
private O
as O
well O
as O
public O
rights O
are O
based O
upon O
it O
. O

9. O
The O
committee O
refused O

The O

11. O
The O
next O
morning O
was O
designated O
for O
us O
to O
attend O
to O
discuss O
with O
the O
committee O
. O

We O
thought O
that O
it O
would O
show O
us O
the O
answers O
of O
those O
it O
had O
questioned O
so O
that O
we O
could O
reply O
to O
them O
. O

But O
we O
were O
surprised O
that O
it O
had O
left O
the O
day O
before O
for O
Riyadh B-GPE
. O

On O
29/4/1426 B-DATE
A. I-DATE
H. I-DATE
the O
committee O
returned O
to O
Wadi B-GPE
al I-GPE

Dawasir I-GPE
. O

We O
appeared O
before O
it O
. O

It O
did O
not O
open O
the O
investigation O
file O
and O
it O
did O
not O
show O
us O
anything O
in O
spite O
of O
our O
request O
and O
our O
informing O
it O
that O
this O
was O
our O
right O
according O
to O
the O
system O
of O
criminal O
procedures O
issued O
by O
royal O
decree O
. O

It O
claimed O
that O
it O
would O
show O
it O
to O
us O
soon O
, O
especially O
the O
representative O
of O
the O
municipality O
of O
Riyadh B-GPE
who O
apparently O
was O
the O
one O
who O
held O
and O
controlled O
the O
documents O
of O
the O
proceedings O
. O

My O
father O
requested O
the O
return O
of O
his O
car O
that O
had O
been O
impounded O
in O
violation O
of O
all O
laws O
and O
regulations O
. O

It O
was O
not O
given O
to O
him O
and O
no O
order O
was O
issued O
to O
hand O
it O
over O
. O

The O
committee O
left O
for O
Riyadh B-GPE
that O
day O
and O
that O
was O
the O
last B-ORDINAL
time O
we O
saw O
of O
it O
. O

At O
the B-DATE
beginning I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
month I-DATE
of I-DATE
Dhu I-DATE

A. I-DATE

, O
the O
office O
of O
the O
head O
of O
the B-ORG
General I-ORG
Investigation I-ORG
and I-ORG
Prosecution I-ORG
Authority I-ORG
called O
me O
and O
told O
me O
that O
the O
head O
of O
the B-ORG
General I-ORG
Investigation I-ORG
and I-ORG
Prosecution I-ORG
Authority I-ORG
and O
the O
Authority B-ORG
's O
committee O
had O
fired O
me O
from O
my O
job O
and O
had O
issued O
that O
decision O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
following O
two B-CARDINAL
reasons O
: O

1. O
Incompetence O
during O
the O
period O
of O
the O
experience O
. O

2. O
Lack O
of O
trust O
and O
consideration O
. O

It O
mentioned O
that O
it O
was O
based O
on O
the O
letter O
of O
the O
governor O
of O
the O
area O
of O
Riyadh B-GPE
, O
and O
that O
it O
was O
appropriate O
that O
I O
submit O
to O
the O
head O
of O
the B-ORG
General I-ORG
Investigation I-ORG
and I-ORG
Prosecution I-ORG
Authority I-ORG
my O
letter O
of O
resignation O
so O
that O
my O
reputation O
would O
not O
be O
tarnished O
by O
that O
decision O
and O
so O
that O
I O
would O
be O
able O
to O
work O
in O
my O
field O
, O
because O
that O
decision O
would O
bar O
me O
from O
employment O
in O
the B-DATE
future I-DATE
. O

So O
I O
traveled O
to O
Riyadh B-GPE
and O
refused O
to O
submit O
my O
resignation O
because O
this O
would O
be O
submitting O
to O
injustice O
and O
arbitrariness O
no O
matter O
what O
the O
consequences O
. O

Our O
reputation O
, O
thank O
God O
, O
is O
honorable O
, O
and O
we O
are O
acknowledged O
in O
the O
circles O
of O
our O
whole O
community O
, O
and O
by O
colleagues O
in O
study O
, O
professors O
, O
sheikhs O
, O
and O
others O
. O

Rather O
, O
just O
the O
opposite O
. O

This O
decision O
would O
harm O
my O
reputation O
and O
the O
integrity O
of O
those O
who O
issued O
it O
, O
and O
it O
would O
weaken O
the O
credibility O
of O
the O
organization O
which O
they O
supervise O
. O

The O
job O
is O
not O
the O
main O
goal O
, O
and O
the O
doors O
of O
livelihood O
are O
wide O
. O

Thank O
God O
we O
are O
affluent O
. O

The O
noble O
person O
does O
not O
bend O
down O
even O
if O
he O
is O
poor O
. O

So O
how O
about O
if O
he O
is O
really O
rich O
? O

My O
representative O
, O
the O
lawyer O
, O
met O
His B-PERSON
Highness I-PERSON
the I-PERSON
Governor I-PERSON
of I-PERSON
Riyadh I-PERSON
, O
Salman B-PERSON
Bin I-PERSON
Abdulaziz I-PERSON
. O

We O
objected O
to O
the O
conclusion O
reached O
by O
the O
committee O
. O

We O
told O
him O
that O
we O
were O
complaining O
to O
him O
to O
find O
justice O
from O
him O
regarding O
those O
who O
were O
unjust O
to O
us O
, O
since O
he O
is O
the O
direct O
authority O
of O
those O
unjust O
people O
. O

But O
unfortunately O
we O
were O
surprised O
that O
he O
committed O
a O
greater O
injustice O
upon O
us O
. O

He O
told O
us O
: O
-LRB- O
If O
you O
want O
to O
leave O
the O
job O
then O
Farraj B-PERSON
's O
job O
is O
with O
me O
, O
and O
you O
will O
be O
held O
against O
me O
. O
-RRB- O

We O
said O
: O
-LRB- O
The O
results O
contradicted O
the O
facts O
of O
the O
proceedings O
. O
We O
were O
not O
informed O
until O
just O
now O
of O
the O
committee O
's O
final O
decision O
. O
What O
is O
needed O
is O
to O
halt O
the O
decision O
of O
dismissal O
, O
especially O
since O
it O
is O
based O
on O
your O
instruction O
, O
until O
we O
are O
given O
a O
copy O
of O
the O
committee O
's O
decision O
so O
we O
can O
respond O
to O
it O
. O
-RRB- O

He O
called O
the O
head O
of O
follow O
- O
up O
and O
said O
: O
-LRB- O
Show O
them O
the O
proceedings O
. O
-RRB- O

Then O
he O
said O
: O
" O
Give O
me O
what O
you O
have O
. O
" O

We O
went O
to O
the O
head O
of O
follow O
- O
up O
, O
who O
said O
: O
-LRB- O
I O
do O
not O
have O
the O
proceedings O
, O
but O
they O
were O
issued O
. O

We O
said O
: O
-LRB- O
You O
have O
the O
decision O
of O
the O
committee O
. O

He O
gave O
us O
an O
appointment O
for O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
day I-DATE
. O

Then O
he O
refused O
to O
show O
us O
the O
decision O
of O
the O
committee O
and O
recited O
its O
results O
to O
us O
. O

The O
results O
contradicted O
the O
facts O
of O
the O
proceedings O
and O
proved O
the O
truth O
of O
what O
we O
referred O
to O
in O
our O
main O
complaint O
. O

So O
we O
submitted O
a O
letter O
to O
the O
governor O
of O
Riyadh B-GPE
in O
which O
we O
contested O
the O
committee O
and O
its O
decision O
, O
and O
we O
explained O
the O
reasons O
for O
that O
. O

We O
stressed O
that O
the O
decision O
for O
dismissal O
should O
be O
halted O
. O

-LRB- O
A O
copy O
of O
the O
letter O
is O
attached O
in O
the O
letters O
and O
documents O
section O
. O
-RRB- O

He O
ordered O
the O
formation O
of O
a O
committee O
, O
according O
to O
what O
we O
were O
told O
. O

It O
was O
explained O
that O
this O
committee O
was O
formed O
of O
the O
head O
of O
Follow O
- O
up O
Abdullah B-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Qarni I-PERSON
, O
the O
assistant O
deputy O
of O
the O
municipality O
, O
Dr. O
Ibrahim B-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Subaihi I-PERSON
, O
and O
two B-CARDINAL

, O
Faraj B-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Asbali I-PERSON
and O
Salih B-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Dayf I-PERSON
. O

So O
far O
this O
committee O
has O
not O
reviewed O
the O
proceedings O
which O
is O
what O
it O
was O
supposed O
to O
do O
, O

and O
Salman B-PERSON
has O
not O
responded O
to O
our O
request O
to O
" O
halt O
the O
decision O
of O
dismissal O
" O
until O
the O
case O
is O
finally O
over O
. O

Then O
the O
head O
of O
the B-ORG
General I-ORG
Investigation I-ORG
and I-ORG
Prosecution I-ORG
Authority I-ORG
submitted O
the O
decision O
of O
my O
dismissal O
-LRB- O
for O
my O
incompetence O
during O
the B-DATE
year I-DATE
of O
my O
tribulation O
and O
for O
my O
lack O
of O
confidence O
and O
respect O
-RRB- O
to O
the B-ORG
ministry I-ORG
of I-ORG
the I-ORG
interior I-ORG
to O
get O
approval O
for O
it O
while O
he O
had O
promised O
us O
to O
reconsider O
the O
decision O
of O
dismissal O
and O
that O
the O
issue O
was O
still O
with O
the O
committee O
. O

We O
learned O
the O
untruthfulness O
of O
what O
he O
said O
. O

So O
we O
submitted O
a O
letter O
to O
the B-PERSON
minister I-PERSON
of I-PERSON
the I-PERSON
interior I-PERSON
-LRB- O
a O
copy O
of O
the O

violates O

and O
the O
truth O
since O
my O
alleged O
incompetence O
during O
the O
period O
of O

was O
answered O

refuted O
by O
the O

And O
my O
alleged O
loss O
of O
trust O
and O
respect O
requires O
knowing O
the O
crime O
attributed O
to O
me O
. O
And O
whether O
or O
not O
it O
was O
a O
crime O
that O
entails O
loss O
of O
trust O
and O
respect O
as O
stipulated O
in O
the O
civil O
service O
regulations O
issued O
by O
decree O
of O
the O
cabinet O
and O
crowned O
with O
an O
order O
by O
the O

? O

It O
also O
requires O
knowing O
the O
final O
judicial O
verdict O
issued O
proving O
this O
crime O
. O

Since O
all O
of O
this O
is O
incorrect O
and O
does O
not O
exist O
, O
it O
indicates O
the O
falsehood O
of O
this O
calumny O
. O

The O
proceedings O
were O
returned O
to O
the O
head O
of O
the O
Authority B-ORG
with O
disapproval O
of O
the O
decision O
of O
dismissal O
because O
of O
its O
violation O
of O
the O
regulation O
. O

When O
checking O
back O
with O
the O
head O
of O
the O
Authority B-ORG
he O
promised O
something O
good O
. O

It O
became O
clear O
that O
he O
returned O
the O
proceedings O
secretly O
to O
the B-PERSON
minister I-PERSON
of I-PERSON
the I-PERSON
interior I-PERSON
requesting O
approval O
of O
the O
decision O
of O

. O

He O
refused O
to O
give O
us O
its O
number O
or O
its O
date O
, O
and O
he O
kept O
the O
issue O
a O
secret O
while O
he O
was O
promising O
it O
to O
us O
. O

It O
was O
revealed O
that O
the O
proceedings O
were O
returned O
to O
him O
again O
. O
And O
that O
he O
justified O
his O
refusal O
of O
the O
previous O
instruction O
on O
the O
invalidity O
of O
the O
decision O
of O
dismissal O
which O
was O
according O
to O
the O
instruction O
of O
the O
governor O
of O
Riyadh B-GPE
and O
his O
insistence O
on O
my O
dismissal O
. O

Then O
we O
found O
out O
that O
he O
had O
kept O
the O
previous O
decision O
and O
its O
proceedings O
including O
all O
the O
explanations O
in O
it O
, O
and O
issued O
a O
new O
decision O
through O
his O
committee O
terminating O
my O
services O
without O
mentioning O
a O
reason O
. O

It O
was O
signed O
by O
the O
minister O
of O
the O
interior O
and O
it O
was O
submitted O
to O
the O
monarchy O
. O

It O
turned O
out O
that O
the O
person O
who O
was O
refusing O
to O
approve O
the O
decision O
of O
the O
head O
of O

was O
His B-PERSON

Taking O
into O

that O
since O
we O
knew O
that O
the O

of O

had O
submitted O
the O
decision O
of O
dismissal O
to O
the B-PERSON

my O

more O
than O
once O
, O
but O
he O
was O
not O

He O
asked O
to O
make O
an O
appointment O
to O
meet O
with O
him O
and O
he O
was O
given O
an O
appointment O
for O
three B-CARDINAL
months O
later O
. O

Two B-CARDINAL

before O
the O
appointment O
he O
was O
notified O
of O
its O

without O

He O
also O
tried O
to O
meet O
his O

he O
could O

My O

The O
well O
- O
known O
Sheikh O
Salman B-PERSON
Al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Oadah I-PERSON
in O
his O
fair O
talk O
about O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
, O
his O
trial O
and O
execution O
in O
such O
a O
brutal O
manner O
, O
crossed O
the O

and O
dotted O
the O
i's O
. O
and O
put O
an O
end O
to O
the O
argument O
regarding O
the O
deeds O
of O
this O
man O

Here O
is O
what O
the O
Sheikh B-PERSON
said O
as O
quoted O
from O
his O
website O
Islam B-WORK_OF_ART
Today I-WORK_OF_ART
: O
-- O

Then O
His B-PERSON
Excellency I-PERSON
was O
asked O
about O
the O
execution O
of O
the O
former O
Iraqi B-NORP
president O
, O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON

He O
responded O
that O
" O
he O
was O
greatly O
sympathized O
with O
by O
the O
Arabs B-NORP
and O
Moslems B-NORP
as O
his O
execution O
came O
at O
an O
outstanding O
time O
. O

If O
it O
had O
been O
asked O
to O
chosen O
a O
time O
, O
he O
would O
not O
have O
found O
a O
better O
and O
more O
outstanding O
one O
than O
this O
one O
. O

and O
he O
said O
that O
he O
was O
a B-NORP
Sunni I-NORP
Moslem I-NORP
from O
the O
community O
of O
Moslems B-NORP
and O
that O
he O
prounounced O
the B-WORK_OF_ART
Testimony I-WORK_OF_ART
of I-WORK_OF_ART
Truth I-WORK_OF_ART
at O
the O
last O
moment O
of O
his O
life O
. O

So O
may O
God O
have O
mercy O
on O
him O
and O
may O
God O
's O
forgive O
us O
and O
him O
. O

As O
it O
is O
said O
in O
the O
Hadith B-WORK_OF_ART
, O
whose O
last O
words O
in O
this O
world O
were O
' O
There O
is O
no O
God O
but O
God O
' O
will O
enter O
paradise O
. O

He O
also O
quoted O
the O
hadith O
of O
Ibn B-PERSON
Masud I-PERSON
in O
Sahih B-WORK_OF_ART
al I-WORK_OF_ART
- I-WORK_OF_ART
Bukhari I-WORK_OF_ART
: O
" O
a O
man O
amongst O
you O
may O
do O
evil O
deeds O
till O
there O
is O
only O
a O
cubit O
between O
him O
and O
the O
Hell O
Fire O
, O
and O
then O
what O
has O
been O
written O
for O
him O
decides O
his O
behavior O
, O
and O
he O
starts O
doing O
deeds O
characteristic O
of O
the O
people O
of O
Paradise O
. O
" O
. O

Then O
he O
added O
that O
Saddam B-PERSON
was O
not O
tried O
by O
a O
legal O
or O
Sharia B-LAW
court O
but O
by O
a O
sectarian O
court O

A O
New O
Scandal O
: O
The O
Lebanese B-NORP
Hezbollah B-ORG
.. O
Buying O
People O
and O
Exploiting O
Their O
Needs O
. O

My B-PERSON

raised I-PERSON

Although O
snakes O
may O
be O
soft O
to O
the O
touch O
, O
...... O
when O
turned O
over O
they O
have O
harmful O
fangs O
. O

Some O
were O
astonished O
by O
the O
number O
of O
people O
who O
are O
staging O
strikes O
in O
Lebanon B-GPE
and O
who O
oppose O
the O
legitimate O
government O
of O
al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Siniora I-PERSON
, O
and O
who O
considered O
this O
as O
mobilization O
on O
the O
part O
of O
Hezbollah B-ORG
and O
its O
supporters O
and O
a O
confirmation O
of O
the O
strength O
of O
this O
organization O
. O

But O
the O
truth O
is O
completely O
different O
from O
that O
, O
since O
the O
majority O
of O
strikers O
are O
jobless O
and O
they O
have O
found O
in O
these O
strikes O
something O
that O
provides O
them O
with O
money O
, O
shelter O
, O
and O
food O
. O
Especially O
after O
it O
became O
clear O
that O
these O
strikers O
are O
paid O
money O
by O
Hezbollah B-ORG
. O

Each O
striker O
is O
paid O
$ O
20 B-MONEY
a O
day O
. O

Imagine O
a O
Lebanese B-NORP
family O
on O
strike O
. O

There O
are O
five B-CARDINAL
members O
, O
for O
example O
, O
so O
they O
will O
get O
$ O
100 B-MONEY
a O
day O
, O
which O
is O
a O
large O
sum O
for O
them O
that O
they O
would O
not O
get O
under O
any O
circumstances O
, O
except O
through O
this O
strike O
which O
they O
wish O
would O
last O
forever O
. O

Hezbollah B-ORG
buys O
these O
people O
and O
exploits O
their O
needs O
to O
achieve O
a O
goal O
and O
political O
aims O
.. O

It O
is O
noticed O
that O
the O
officials O
in O
Hezbollah B-ORG
prevent O
any O
stranger O
from O
entering O
the O
places O
of O
the O
strikes O
or O
trying O
to O
get O
in O
touch O
or O
talk O
with O
some O
of O
the O
strikers O
for O
fear O
of O
revealing O
these O
secrets O
. O

Nothing O
new O
my O

as O
implied O
by O
the O
title O
of O
the O
subject O
, O
because O
Hezbo B-ORG

trades O
at O
the O
expense O
of O
the O
Lebanese B-NORP
. O

And O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
on O
its O

is O
to O
take O

My O

Yes O
, O
this O
is O
the O
truth O
. O

Hezbollah B-ORG
is O
trading O
in O
the O
Lebanese B-NORP
people O
to O
serve O
its O
aims O
and O
the O
aims O
of O
those O
who O

the O

of O
the O

today O
are O
with O
Iran B-GPE
and O

, O
and O
here O
it O
is O

My O

The O
facts O
are O
clear O
and O
do O
not O
need O

Last O
week O
I O
was O
in O
-LRB- O
Beirut B-GPE
-RRB- O
on O
a O

I O
have O

with O
many O
Lebanese B-NORP

Sunnis B-NORP

Shiites B-NORP
-RRB- O
and O
I O
saw O
what O
is O
happening O
on O

The O
thing O
is O
no O

and O
any O

can O

I'll O
mention O
to O
you O
a O
report O
written O
by O
an O
American B-NORP

who O
speaks O
about O
some O
of O
these O

, O
particularly O
the O
attempt O
of O

They O
try O

them O
from O
the O

of O
the O

All O

The B-ORG
Doha I-ORG
Debates I-ORG
are O
considered O
to O
be O
a O
miniature O
source O
of O
democracy O
in O
a O
big O
oasis O
that O
gathers O
the O
Qataris B-NORP
in O
a O
unique O
mixture O
of O
intellectual O
openness O
to O
the O
world O
and O
awareness O
of O
all O
that O
is O
happening O

removed O
from O
any O

in O
a O
totally O
calm O
way O

Qatar B-GPE
's O
reception O
for O
Shimon B-PERSON
Peres I-PERSON
came O
from O
this O
angle O
.. O
addressing O
the O
mind O
and O
conversing O
to O
create O
a O
solution O
for O
many O
pending O
matters O
and O
also O
to O
make O
the O
Qatari B-NORP
public O
in O
particular O
and O
the O
Arab B-NORP
public O
in O
general O
understand O
what O
takes O
place O
in O
a O
democratic O
atmosphere O
.. O

In O
Qatar B-GPE
there O
are O
many O
independent O
universities O
, O
both O
Arab B-NORP
and O
international O
, O
and O
there O
are O
branches O
of O
well O
established O
international O
universities O
. O

The O
invitation O
was O
from O
the O
Doha B-ORG
Debates I-ORG
program O
.. O

This O
is O
a O
program O
that O
gathers O
together O
many O
intellectuals O
, O
scientists O
, O
heads O
of O
state O
, O
and O
others O
to O
discuss O
numerous O
topics O
with O
complete O
transparency O
and O
democracy O
.. O

I O
was O
hoping O
that O
the O
Doha B-ORG
Debates I-ORG
program O
would O
invite O
Prince O
Sultan B-PERSON
to O
ask O
him O
about O
the O
weapons O
deal O
or O
al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Walid I-PERSON
bin I-PERSON
Talal I-PERSON
to O
ask O
him O
about O
waste O
and O
the O
launching O
of O
the O
songs O
channels O
, O
or O
Luluah B-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Faisal I-PERSON
and O
her O
future O
ambitions O
.. O

Claiming O
power O
by O
being O
silent O
is O
something O
shameful O
for O
some O
countries O
as O
is O
deluding O
the O
people O
with O
their O
silence O
into O
thinking O
that O
they O
are O
powerful O
while O
in O
fact O
they O
are O
hiding O
their O
weakness O
. O

I O
think O
that O
dialogue O
is O
neither O
a O
shame O
nor O
should O
it O
be O
rejected O
.. O

You O
talk O
to O
your O
enemy O
and O
discuss O
with O
him O
.. O

But O
the O
closed O
door O
policy O
.. O
this O
is O
a O
disaster O
for O
the O
people O
and O
a O
pretense O
that O
you O
are O
brave O
through O
a O
lying O
and O
trumpeting O
media O
while O
in O
the O
end O
you O
fail O
in O
the O
least O
confrontation O
.. O

Back O
to O
the O
main O
issue O
.. O
we O
say O
who O
is O
Peres B-PERSON
? O

No O
one O
denies O
that O
Peres B-PERSON
is O
a O
criminal O
. O

But O
who O
is O
Peres B-PERSON
? O

Peres B-PERSON
received O
the B-WORK_OF_ART
Nobel I-WORK_OF_ART
Peace I-WORK_OF_ART
Prize I-WORK_OF_ART
in O
1994 B-DATE
. O

He O
shared O
the O
prize O
with O
both O
Yasser B-PERSON
Arafat I-PERSON
and O
the O
Israeli B-NORP
Prime O
Minister O
at O
that O
time O
, O
Yitzhak B-PERSON
Rabin I-PERSON
. O

Peres B-PERSON
has O
a O
special O
interest O
in O
precision O
electronics O
. O

In O
1997 B-DATE
, O
he O
established O
the B-ORG
" I-ORG
Peres I-ORG
Center I-ORG
for I-ORG
Peace I-ORG
. O
" O

In O
other O
words O
, O
the O
man O
is O
looking O
for O
more O
peace O
than O
war O
. O

There O
is O
a O
difference O
between O
holding O
discussions O
with O
a O
man O
of O
peace O
and O
holding O
discussions O
with O
a O
man O
looking O
for O
war O
.. O

Peres B-PERSON
is O
also O
a O
man O
who O
received O
the B-WORK_OF_ART
Nobel I-WORK_OF_ART
Peace I-WORK_OF_ART
Prize I-WORK_OF_ART
jointly O
with O
Arafat B-PERSON
.. O

Peres B-PERSON
spent O
money O
establishing O
the B-ORG
Peres I-ORG
Center I-ORG
for I-ORG
Peace I-ORG
while O
Yasser B-PERSON
Arafat I-PERSON
spent O
money O
on O
his O
wife O
. O

We O
have O
n't O
heard O
that O
he O
established O
any O
organization O
to O
support O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
people O
with O
that O
money O
.. O

When O
he O
took O
office O
as O
Prime O
Minister O
Peres B-PERSON
concluded O
successful O
transactions O
to O
acquire O
weapons O
. O

He O
also O
sought O
to O
establish O
a O
deterrent O
nuclear O
program O
since O
Israel B-GPE
owns O
the O
biggest O
nuclear O
arsenal O
in O
the O
world O
. O

All O
this O
was O
during O
his O
tenure O
. O

This O
means O
that O
the O
man O
thinks O
and O
plans O
. O

This O
is O
due O
to O
his O
knowledge O
and O
studies O
in O
his O
field O
of O
electronics O
.. O

Again O
we O
say O
that O
knowledge O
is O
a O
powerful O
weapon O
for O
any O
national O
progress O
.. O

Peres B-PERSON
attained O
this O
as O
a O
result O
of O
.. O
knowledge O
and O
proficiency O
.. O
in O
his O
personality O
, O
which O
helped O
give O
him O
an O
edge O
in O
confronting O
any O
situation O
by O
putting O
him O
in O
a O
position O
of O
strength O
, O
and O
not O
weakness O
.. O

Conversely O
, O
we O
see O
the O
squandering O
of O
money O
on O
the O
other O
side O
for O
trivial O
things O
that O
do O
not O
serve O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
cause O
and O
do O
not O
serve O
the O
Arabs B-NORP
and O
the O
Muslims B-NORP
. O

We O
find O
numerous O
satellite O
channels O
financed O
by O
Islamic B-NORP
countries O
, O
and O
we O
also O
find O
numerous O
princes O
and O
kings O
and O
presidents O
who O
spend O
large O
amounts O
of O
money O
on O
their O
vacations O
. O

We O
also O
find O
that O
most O
of O
the O
Arab B-NORP
people O
and O
some O
Gulf B-LOC
people O
live O
below O
the O
poverty O
line O
.. O

Furthermore O
, O
most O
of O
the O
presidents O
of O
the O
Arab B-NORP
and O
Gulf B-LOC
states O
do O
not O
have O
any O
high O
scientific O
degree O
or O
any O
sound O
plan O
to O
build O
a O
strong O
country O
at O
the O
scientific O
level O
.. O

They O
do O
not O
even O
have O
any O
interest O
in O
education O
or O
in O
establishing O
strong O
universities O
in O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
place O
, O
except O
for O
Qatar B-GPE
. O

Back O
to O
our O
topic O
. O

Some O
of O
those O
who O
posted O
pictures O
in O
the O
forum O
did O
not O
mention O
the O
topic O
and O
did O
not O
refer O
to O
the O
reason O
for O
the O
visit O
. O

They O
just O
posted O
the O
pictures O
and O
commented O
on O
the O
topic O
from O
their O
imagination O
.. O

His O
Highness O
the O
Prince O
receives O
the O
man O
of O
peace O
in O
Israel B-GPE
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
bring O
Hamas B-ORG

Israel B-GPE
together O
. O

All O
this O
in O
consultation O
with O
Hamas B-ORG
in O
Syria B-GPE
and O
Palestine B-GPE
so O
as O
to O
bring O
views O
closer O
.. O

I O
think O
that O
this O
approach O
of O
holding O
a O
meeting O
between O
Peres B-PERSON
and O
Hamas B-ORG
without O
preliminary O
agreement O
by O
the O
leaders O
of O
Hamas B-ORG
basically O
holds O
no O
benefit O
for O

Peres B-PERSON
admitted O
that O
his O
country O
lost O
the O
last O
war O
in O
Lebanon B-GPE
. O

He O
said O
that O
this O
war O
was O
a O
loss O
for O
Israel B-GPE
from O
the O
point O
of O
view O
of O
many O
politicians O

In O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
every O
war O
is O
a O
loss O
because O

During O

Peres B-PERSON

that O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
every O

a O
loss O

Peres B-PERSON
's O
visit O
to O
the O
students O
' O
hall O
so O
they O
could O
talk O
to O
him O
-LRB- O
as O
a O
man O
of O
peace O
-RRB- O
and O
not O
as O
a O
Jew B-NORP
or O
a O
war O
criminal O
.. O
that O
is O
something O
normal O
for O
any O
visiting O
official O
to O
be O
received O
by O
university O
officials O
. O

I O
think O
that O
the O
picture O
is O
normal O
. O

Discussion O
of O
the O
Arab B-NORP
- O
Israeli B-NORP
situation O
by O
the O
students O
in O
a O
unique O
democratic O
oasis O
in O
Qatar B-GPE
. O

All O
sides O
are O
there O
.. O
debating O
, O
discussing O
, O
arguing O
in O
a O
democratic O
atmosphere O
difficult O
to O
see O
in O
any O
country O
.. O

I O
think O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
that O
if O
democracy O
in O
some O
of O
the O
neighboring O
countries O
is O
non-existent O
in O
the O
simplest O
matters O
related O
to O
their O
personal O
rights O
and O
the O
demand O
for O
them O
. O
Then O
how O
could O
they O
reach O
to O
the O
level O
of O
Qatar B-GPE
in O
gathering O
this O
huge O
number O
of O
intellectuals O
, O
politicians O
, O
and O
heads O
of O
state O
to O
discuss O
sensitive O
issues O
that O
concern O
the O
Arab B-NORP
World O
? O

After O
Qatar B-GPE
went O
beyond O
local O
democracy O
and O
human O
rights O
in O
the O
country O
.. O
praise O
God O
and O
many O
thanks O
to O
His O
Highness O
Sheikh O
Hamad B-PERSON
bin I-PERSON
Khalifa I-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Thani I-PERSON
, O
who O
established O
democracy O
and O
freedom O
in O
the O
country O
.. O
and O
made O
Qatar B-GPE
a O
platform O
for O
dialogue O
.. O
so O
the O
discussion O
took O
place O
in O
Qatar B-GPE
. O

There O
was O
disagreement O
and O
agreement O
, O
and O
that O
is O
something O
normal O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
present O
atmosphere O
.. O

But O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
we O
find O
different O
meetings O
without O
any O
outcome O
because O
of O
the O
lack O
of O
democratic O
basis O
for O
dialogue O
. O

All O
that O
results O
from O
not O
accepting O
various O
opinions O
. O

Conversely O
, O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
lack O
of O
freedom O
among O
the O
Arab B-NORP
people O
we O
find O
that O
it O
is O
America B-GPE
which O
is O
in O
the O
driver O
's O
seat O
and O
steers O
guests O
wherever O
it O
wants O
and O
takes O
them O
on O
tours O
without O
any O
questioning O
directed O
at O
it O
. O

All O
this O
marginalizes O
the O
Arab B-NORP
individual O
as O
though O
he O
had O
no O
-LRB- O
mind O
-RRB- O
or O
-LRB- O
opinion O
-RRB- O
, O
and O
you O
find O
that O
the O
areas O
he O
is O
allowed O
to O
talk O
about O
are O
women O
driving O
in O
Saudi B-GPE
Arabia I-GPE
and O
similar O
useless O
topics O
.. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
explain O
something O
to O
the O
brothers O
: O
Peres B-PERSON
's O
visit O
is O
an O
internal O
Qatari B-NORP
affair O
. O

It O
was O
announced O
in O
the O
newspapers O
that O
Peres B-PERSON
would O
visit O
Qatar B-GPE
, O
and O
it O
was O
announced O
in O
the O
three B-CARDINAL
Qatari B-NORP
newspapers O
. O

There O
are O
writers O
in O
Qatar B-GPE
who O
have O
positive O
opinions O
as O
well O
as O
negative O
opinions O
. O

This O
difference O
is O
good O
and O
something O
through O
which O
nations O
and O
people O
progress O
. O

That O
is O
what O
happened O
in O
the O
forum O
. O

While O
he O
was O
leaving O
the O
hall O
, O
a O
student O
addressed O
Shimon B-PERSON
Peres I-PERSON
with O
the O
word O
" O
terrorist O
" O
.. O
" O
terrorist O
" O
in O
English B-LANGUAGE
, O
which O
caused O
the O
accompanying O
Qatari B-NORP
security O
to O
intervene O
to O
prevent O
him O
from O
continuing O
. O

But O
the O
question O
now O
is O
: O
Who O
is O
better O
.. O
Peres B-PERSON
or O
George B-PERSON
Bush I-PERSON
? O

How O
many O
did O
Peres B-PERSON
kill O
and O
how O
many O
did O
Bush B-PERSON
kill O
? O

. O

There O
are O
at B-CARDINAL
least I-CARDINAL
three I-CARDINAL
defects O
in O
this O
exposition O
of O
yours O
. O

First B-ORDINAL
- O
lack O
of O
vision O
: O

You O
describe O
the O
contemporary O
Qatari B-NORP
situation O
as O
just O
a O
legitimate O
quest O
for O
scientific O
and O
technological O
superiority O
.. O

If O
we O
could O
agree O
that O
we O
fall O
behind O
the O
Zionists B-NORP
and O
Americans B-NORP
in O
such O
fields O
... O
however O
the O
problem O
lies O
in O
ignoring O
all O
this O
clear O
evidence O
that O
the O
scientific O
project O
is O
nothing O
but O
a O
small O
misleading O
part O
of O
a O
campaign O
meant O
to O
change O
the O
Islamic B-NORP
Gulf B-LOC
and O
Qatari B-NORP
identity O
and O
to O
remove O
its O
established O
fixed O
principles O
in O
which O
they O
surpass O
everything O
that O
the O
Zionists B-NORP
and O
the O
Americans B-NORP
have O
. O

How O
can O
you O
reconcile O
the O
will O
of O
scientific O
and O
technological O
progress O
.. O
and O
hosting O
the B-EVENT
Asian I-EVENT
Olympics I-EVENT
or O
a O
military O
base O
or O
a O
Zionist B-NORP
politician O
or O
a O
program O
like O
the B-ORG
Doha I-ORG
Debates I-ORG
? O

So O
... O
the O
purely O
scientific O
and O
technological O
side O
can O
not O
justify O
what O
is O
happening O
in O
Qatar B-GPE
. O

***** O

Secondly B-ORDINAL
, O
the O
contradiction O
of O
principle O
and O
the O
dominance O
of O
worldly O
interests O
. O

In O
your O
article O
here O
, O
you O
justified O
the O
legitimacy O
of O
hosting O
Peres B-PERSON
from O
the O
perspective O
of O
exchanging O
opinions O
, O
dialogue O
, O
and O
using O
intellect O
... O

Would O
you O
have O
held O
the O
same O
position O
if O
a O
terrorist O
or O
a O
well O
- O
known O
criminal O
were O
hosted O
under O
the O
slogan O
of O
, O
the O
language O
of O
reason O
, O
friendly O
media O
dialogue O
, O
and O
openness O
to O
the O
other O
?... O

Would O
you O
accept O
it O
if O
your O
neighbor O
hosted O
someone O
who O
had O
attacked O
you O
?? O

So O
... O
there O
are O
principles O
that O
must O
be O
adhered O
to O
.. O

The O
most O
important O
of O
them O
is O
supporting O
the O
truth O
and O
loyalty O
to O
Muslims B-NORP
even O
if O
it O
goes O
against O
narrow O
personal O
interests O
... O
and O
the O
relationship O
of O
Saudi B-GPE
Arabia I-GPE
with O
the O
Americans B-NORP
... O

Despite O
my O
being O
convinced O
that O
it O
should O
be O
limited O
after O
the O
latter O
's O
aggression O
, O
it O
does O
not O
in O
any O
way O
reach O
the O
level O
of O
the O
relationship O
of O
Qatar B-GPE
with O
the O
Americans B-NORP
themselves O
. O

-LRB- O
The O
tension O
in O
the O
relations O
with O
Saudi B-GPE
Arabia I-GPE
recently O
and O
the O
military O
base O
on O
the O
Qatari B-NORP
territory O
despite O
the O
state O
of O
peace O
in O
the O
region O
are O
evidence O
of O
that O
-RRB- O
... O

So O
how O
come O
Qatar B-GPE
is O
now O
adding O
to O
this O
with O
intimate O
relations O
with O
those O
whose O
existence O
and O
history O
and O
reality O
are O
entirely O
connected O
to O
aggression O
against O
Muslims B-NORP
.. O
namely O
the O
Zionists B-NORP
!!? O

A O
mistake O
can O
not O
be O
justified O
by O
committing O
a O
bigger O
mistake O
or O
proceeding O
further O
in O
it O
!! O
. O

**** O

Thirdly B-ORDINAL
, O
going O
overboard O
with O
freedom O
: O

There O
is O
a O
kind O
of O
mania O
in O
the O
field O
of O
freedom O
that O
makes O
many O
people O
think O
that O
every O
freedom O
is O
commendable O
.. O
While O
giving O
free O
rein O
to O
freedom O
is O
a O
recipe O
for O
chaos O
and O
corruption O
.. O
even O
in O
the O
field O
of O
speech O
or O
science O
... O

For O
example O
, O
there O
is O
no O
room O
for O
freedom O
in O
talking O
about O
God O
and O
His O
Prophet B-PERSON
and O
His O
verses O
since O
it O
comes O
in O
the O
context O
of O
what O
brought O
the O
disbelievers O
to O
hell O
. O

But O
we O
used O
to O
embark O
boldly O
with O
bold O
talkers O
.. O

There O
is O
no O
room O
for O
leaving O
the O
door O
wide O
open O
for O
discussing O
or O
teaching O
" O
science O
and O
technology O
" O
as O
the O
theory O
of O
development O
.. O
or O
the O
theories O
of O
Darwin B-PERSON
.. O
or O
how O
to O
make O
bombs O
or O
liquor O
.. O
or O
the O
creeds O
of O
polytheism O
or O
excessiveness O
in O
regarding O
others O
as O
unbelievers O
.. O
or O
the O
sciences O
of O
judging O
with O
anything O
other O
than O
the O
revelations O
of O
God O
-LRB- O
except O
by O
the O
way O
of O
warning O
against O
them O
-RRB- O
.. O

So O
... O
imposing O
censorship O
and O
certain O
regulations O
on O
the O
work O
of O
educational O
and O
media O
institutions O
is O
not O
a O
matter O
for O
censure O
or O
a O
sign O
of O
backwardness O
... O
rather O
it O
might O
be O
a O
necessary O
and O
urgent O
requirement O
... O
especially O
if O
those O
in O
charge O
of O
theses O
institutions O
are O
non-Muslims B-NORP
.. O
or O
if O
the O
ones O
exposed O
are O
our O
younger O
generation O
and O
the O
treasures O
of O
our O
nation O
!!. O

You O
might O
even O
be O
filled O
with O
admiration O
of O
the O
contradiction O
in O
attitudes O
when O
you O
see O
the O
" O
supporters O
of O
freedom O
" O
demanding O
the O
imposition O
of O
government O
censorship O
on O
courses O
in O
Koran B-WORK_OF_ART
memorization O
, O
charitable O
institutions O
, O
and O
the O
pulpits O
in O
some O
of O
our O
countries O
!!!!. O

+++ O

What O
is O
happening O
in O
Qatar B-GPE
is O
a O
political O
and O
intellectual O
penetration O
in O
the O
countries O
of O
the O
region O
in O
every O
meaning O
of O
the O
word O
.. O

The O
danger O
they O
face O
is O
very O
serious O
... O

Of O
course O
, O
those O
who O
want O
to O
penetrate O
us O
will O
not O
declare O
that O
... O

Rather O
, O
they O
will O
hide O
their O
aims O
behind O
sweet O
words O
or O
promises O
of O
providing O
limited O
or O
imaginary O
benefits O
... O

Otherwise O
, O
we O
would O
not O
be O
deceived O
by O
the O
trick O
... O

For O
many O
Muslims B-NORP
today O
their O
priorities O
are O
confused O
... O

So O
they O
weigh O
things O
without O
the O
guidance O
of O
God O
... O

This O
is O
the O
real O
reason O
for O
our O
present O
situation O
.. O
not O
just O
because O
of O
scientific O
or O
technological O
backwardness O
. O

-LRB- O
You O
will O
find O
the O
Jews B-NORP
and O
polytheists O
the O
ones O
most O
hostile O
to O
the O
believers O
-RRB- O
. O

-LRB- O
God O
forbids O
you O
to O
turn O
in O
friendship O
to O
those O
who O

your O

out O

Those O
who O

I O
am O
a O
programmer O
and O
a O
computer O
systems O
analyst O
.. O

I O
took O
a O
course O
at O
the B-ORG
General I-ORG
Administration I-ORG
Institute I-ORG
in O
the O
field O
of O
computers O
and O
Qatari B-NORP
trainees O
attended O
the O
course O
with O
us O
.. O

What O
happened O
was O
that O
after O
two B-DATE
days I-DATE
those O
Qataris B-NORP
disappeared O
and O
I O
never O
saw O
them O
again O
.. O

I O
saw O
them O
a B-DATE
week I-DATE
later I-DATE
in O
the O
restaurant O
of O
the O
institute O
. O

I O
asked O
them O
" O
I O
hope O
that O
nothing O
bad O
has O
happened O
. O
Where O
have O
you O
been O
? O
you O
have O
n't O
attended O
with O
us O
.. O
" O

They O
said O
,, O
The O
lecturer O
comes O
in O
, O
gives O
the O
lecture O
, O
and O
leaves O
but O
we O
do O
not O
understand O
anything O
even O
though O
he O
is O
an B-NORP
Egyptian I-NORP
Arab I-NORP
.. O

We O
decided O
to O
transfer O
to O
a O
course O
that O
is O
easier O
than O
this O
one O
in O
the O
field O
of O
administration O
. O

The O
director O
of O
admissions O
understood O
our O
situation O
and O
accepted O
the O
transfer O
to O
a O
program O
in O
administration O
. O

So O
why O
should O
we O
go O
back O
to O
Qatar B-GPE
without O
getting O
a O
degree O
? O
" O

But O
you O
, O
al B-PERSON

are O
sitting O
here O
philosophizing O
, O
telling O
lies O
, O
and O
saying O
that O
you O
have O
an O
advanced O
educational O
system O
. O

And O
by O
the O
way O
, O
there O
were O
also O
Omanis B-NORP
with O
us O
, O
and O
they O
completed O
the O
course O
normally O
with O
us O
.. O

In O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
place O
, O
the O
course O
was O
in O
the O
C++ B-LANGUAGE
language O
, O
which O
is O
easy O
, O
but O
such O
is O
your O
education O
that O
maybe O
you O
do O
, O
even O
know O
anything O
about O
Access B-PRODUCT
.. O

Anyone O
who O
heard O
you O
would O
say O
that O
you O
went O
into O
space O
or O
that O
you O
had O
separation O
surgery O
for O
Siamese O
twins O
.. O

I O
say O
God O
have O
mercy O

Shalom O
to O

to O

, O
but O
do O
n't O
lie O
and O
say O
he O
came O
to O
you O
through O
Saudi B-NORP

But O
you O
are O
excused O
since O
it O
seems O
that O
you O
do O
not O
know O
where O
he O
came O
from O

I O
do O
n't O
blame O
you O
if O
those O
who O
are O
greater O
than O
you O
do O
n't O
enter O
the O
American B-NORP

It O
is O
enough O
that O

That O
idea O
of O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
airspace O
is O
nice O
, O
but O
what O
is O
nicer O
than O
that O
is O
playing O
host O
to O
the O
democratic O
enemy O
in O
your O
land O
... O

But O
my O
opinion O
is O
for O
you O
and O
the O
Qataris B-NORP
to O
discuss O
with O
him O
the O
issue O
of O
murdering O
innocent O
children O
and O
usurping O
the O
rights O
of O
others O
. O

Or O
more O
clearly O
, O
you O
should O
ask O
him O
to O
explain O
to O
you O
how O
to O
hate O
your O
neighbors O
and O
maybe O
he O
would O
train O
you O
in O
usurping O
their O
rights O
or O
train O
you O
in O
killing O
and O
shedding O
blood O
... O

The O
phrase O
" O
away O
from O
any O
prejudice O
" O
is O
also O
nice O
. O

Do O
n't O
you O
have O
any O
feelings O
of O
group O
spirit O
, O
my O
friend O
? O

What O
the O
Jews B-NORP
are O
doing O
does O
not O
call O
for O
any O
prejudice O
or O
bias O
. O

I O
believe O
what O
runs O
in O
your O
veins O
is O
not O
blood O
but O
cold O
water O
... O

You O
justify O
this O
visit O
by O
this O
person O
, O
whose O
hands O
are O
stained O
with O
the O
blood O
of O
the O
Muslims B-NORP
, O
and O
you O
criticize O
the O
weapons O
deals O
. O

This O
is O
normal O
. O

These O
weapons O
are O
for O
defending O
ourselves O
against O
our O
enemy O
whom O
you O
receive O
with O
hugs O
and O
so O
on O
.. O
While O
those O
who O
you O
say O
are O
strong O
are O
strong O
indeed O
, O
but O
not O
with O
Peres B-PERSON
. O

They O
are O
strong O
and O
we O
wo O
n't O
invite O
them O
to O
our O
country O
to O
discuss O
their O
culture O
which O
we O
know O
and O
you O
know O
. O

But O
you O
are O
weak O
, O
weaker O
than O
a O
fly O
. O

Therefore O
you O
are O
feigning O
strength O
with O
the O
descendents O
of O
monkeys O
. O

Why O
should O
we O
go O
that O
far O
? O

Previously O
, O
your O
foreign O
minister O
likened O
your O
small O
country O
to O
Israel B-GPE
. O

What O
a O
bad O
comparison O
and O
what O
it O
was O
compared O
to O
! O

You O
greatly O
admire O
the O
Peres B-PERSON
's O
education O
and O
his O
academic O
degrees O
. O

Who O
else O
other O
than O
you O
would O
admire O
that O
? O

He O
is O
your O
highest O
ideal O
... O

If O
you O
were O
a O
Muslim B-NORP
, O
and O
had O
an O
atom O
of O
religion O
, O
you O
would O
not O
have O
written O
this O
article O

I O
grieve O
for O
myself O
while O
I O
am O
replying O
to O
you O
, O
but O
people O
like O
you O
will O
not O
be O
spared O

you O
are O

shame O

Scandal O
of O
Hiring O

Female O

Would O
They O

Made O
Them O

Fayiz B-PERSON

Anyone O
who O
is O
acquainted O
with O
soccer O
is O
aware O
that O
cheering O
is O
not O
necessarily O
by O
the O
cheerleaders O
belonging O
to O
a O
team O
or O
a O
national O
team O
. O

You O
can O
provide O
a O
group O
of O
mercenaries O
? O
To O
spread O
enthusiasm O
among O
the O
players O
? O

I O
remember O
that O
few B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
the O
national O
team O
of O
Saudi B-GPE
Arabia I-GPE
was O
participating O
in O
an O
Asian B-NORP
championship O
held O
in O
an O
East B-NORP
- I-NORP
Asian I-NORP
country O
-- O
I O
think O
it O
was O
Thailand B-GPE
! O

The O
grandstand O
of O
Saudi B-GPE
Arabia I-GPE
was O
crowded O
with O
Thai B-NORP
girls O
, O
maybe O
some O
of O
them O
were O
Saudi B-NORP
! O

As O
a O
result O
of O
the O
attacks O
of O
young O
men O
and O
some O
old O
men O
in O
the O
past O
!! O
Throughout O
the O
match O
they O
were O
repeating O
the O
phrase O
" O
Saudi B-NORP
hah O
hah O
, O
Saudi B-NORP
hah O
hah O
, O
" O
and O
they O
would O
not O
stop O
repeating O
it O
until O
the O
lights O
of O
the O
stadium O
were O
turned O
off O
!! O

Today O
cheering O
has O
become O
a O
profitable O
job O
. O

The O
professional O
cheerleader O
may O
be O
paid O
a O
higher O
salary O
than O
the O
player O
. O

I O
recall O
a O
Saudi B-NORP
club O
entered O
into O
contract O
with O
a O
cheerleader O
of O
a O
competitor O
team O
!! O

His O
job O
was O
only O
to O
repeat O
the O
name O
of O
the O
club O
in O
a O
loud O
voice O
throughout O
the O
match O
!? O

In O
the O
Gulf B-LOC
championship O
which O
is O
held O
in O
Abu B-GPE
Dhabi I-GPE
, O
wailing O
female O
cheerleaders O
were O
hired O
to O
support O
the O
Saudi B-GPE
Arabia I-GPE
national O
team O
!! O

This O
was O
also O
done O
in O
all O
foreign O
championships O
in O
which O
the O
team O
participated O
. O

Because O
we O
are O
a O
conservative O
nation O
that O
does O
not O
accept O
mingling O
between O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
sexes O
, O
women O
and O
everyone O
like O
them O
were O
in O
another O
grandstand O
-- O
not O
the O
one O
for O
the O
cheerleader O
group O
-- O
so O
that O
nothing O
with O
non-praiseworthy O
consequences O
might O
occur O
!! O

The O
scandal O
is O
that O
the O
person O
who O
chose O
them O
did O
not O
take O
into O
consideration O
the O
disparity O
in O
specifications O
? O

We O
were O
shown O
girls O
who O
were O
dressed O
in O
a O
revealing O
way O
, O
bending O
and O
drawing O
people O
's O
attention O
, O
blondes O
with O
green O
eyes O
. O

With O
my O
own O
eyes O
, O
I O
saw O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
with O
the O
lower O
part O
of O
her O
abdomen O
revealed O
out O
of O
increased O
enthusiasm O
!! O

And O
the O
funny O
thing O
is O
that O
some O
of O
them O
tied O
the O
kaffiyeh O
on O
their O
heads O
!! O

Maybe O
prior O
to O
that O
they O
were O
in O
the O
Yemeni B-NORP
team O
grandstand O
, O
before O
they O
moved O
to O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
team O
grandstand O
. O

What O
makes O
one O
weep O
is O
that O
the O
flag O
of O
monotheism O
which O
King O
Abdul B-PERSON
Aziz I-PERSON
carried O
in O
the O
fields O
of O
jihad O
and O
with O
which O
he O
unified O
the O
country O
is O
wrapped O
around O
the O
waist O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
swaying O
with O
it O
!! O

This O
degradation O
of O
the O
flag O
of O
monotheism O
is O
a O
continuation O
of O
the O
act O
done O
by O
some O
silly O
people O
when O
they O
hung O
it O
in O
the O
house O
of O
prostitution O
and O
vice O
!! O

The O
wall O
posters O
of O
the O
kingdom O
of O
dinosaurs O
did O
not O
believe O
the O
news O
and O
they O
started O
publishing O
color O
pictures O
of O
the O
charming O
cheerleaders O
on O
the O
pages O
of O
their O
newspapers O
-- O
on O
the O
front O
page O
!! O
Announcing O
the O
good O
news O
of O
a O
good O
era O
!! O

The O
scandal O
sheet O
Shams B-ORG
, O
the O
adolescent O
dinosaur O
, O
did O
the O
most O
, O
and O
it O
was O
happier O
than O
others O
. O

What O
made O
me O
laugh O
about O
it O
was O
nothing O
but O
a O
piece O
of O
news O
saying O
. O
" O
A O
number O
of O
photographers O
working O
for O
a O
number O
of O
Saudi B-NORP
publications O
received O
harshly O
worded O
threats O
from O
their O
wives O
if O
they O
disapproved O
of O
taking O
photos O
of O
the O
sweet O
sex O
at O
the O
championship O
. O
" O

The O
truth O
is O
that O
most O
of O
the O
newspapers O
stopped O
saying O
that O
the O
girls O
supporting O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
team O
are O
Saudis B-NORP
, O
since O
the O
features O
and O
complexions O
of O
those O
girls O
are O
not O
in O
keeping O
with O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
climate O
!? O

But O
Jasir B-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Jasir I-PERSON
, O
the O
writer O
for O
the O
newspaper O
Shams B-ORG
, O
refused O
to O
do O
anything O
other O
than O
make O
fools O
out O
of O
us O
by O
insisting O
that O
they O
are O
Saudis B-NORP
. O

If O
he O
was O
asked O
to O
swear O
, O
he O
would O
not O
hesitate O
because O
of O
a O
need O
in O
his O
sick O
soul O
. O

He O
undoubtedly O
knows O
that O
they O
are O
hired O
. O

He O
says O
-LRB- O
may O
God O
guide O
him O
-RRB- O
: O
" O
The O
Saudi B-NORP
woman O
is O
no O
longer O
ashamed O
of O
herself O
, O
or O
perhaps O
more O
correctly O
she O
has O
been O
freed O
from O
her O
fear O
after O
the O
shrinking O
of O
the O
spheres O
of O
punishment O
, O
so O
it O
became O
common O
for O
her O
to O
show O
up O
in O
the O
grandstands O
in O
the O
stadiums O
to O
cheer O
for O
her O
country O
's O
team O
. O
" O

Then O
with O
the O
utmost O
stupidity O
, O
insolence O
, O
and O
ridicule O
he O
says O
: O
" O
By O
the O
way O
, O
painting O
the O
whole O
face O
constitutes O
a O
kind O
of O
veil O
" O
. O

What O
confused O
that O
poor O
man O
is O
that O
this O
audience O
has O
so O
far O
not O
stirred O
up O
the O
expected O
storm O
!! O

The O
most O
amazing O
thing O
is O
that O
Jasir B-PERSON
claims O
that O
the O
adversaries O
of O
al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Qusaybi I-PERSON
have O
thwarted O
his O
conservative O
project O
for O
women O
's O
work O
, O
and O
today O
al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Qusaybi I-PERSON
states O
that O
businessmen O
are O
the O
cause O
of O
the O
project O
's O
delay O
!! O

So O
who O
is O
lying O
? O

Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Qusaybi I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
conservative O
project O
for O
women O
's O
work O
has O
made O
a O
decision O
which O
decreases O
the O
rate O
of O
Saudization O
in O
women O
's O
workshops O
! O

That O
sick O
Jasir B-PERSON
is O
lying O
and O
he O
knows O
he O
is O
lying O
, O
yet O
he O
lies O
! O

And O
he O
insists O
with O
utmost O
foolishness O
that O
the O
female O
cheerleaders O
are O
Saudi B-NORP
!! O

Not O
only O
that O
, O
but O
he O
claims O
that O
they O
traveled O
to O
Abu B-GPE
Dhabi I-GPE
to O
attend O
the O
matches O
of O
the O
national O
team O
!! O

Using O
a O
funny O
expression O
he O
says O
: O
" O
The O
difficulty O
is O
that O
no O
one O
can O
prevent O
women O
from O
traveling O
to O
Abu B-GPE
Dhabi I-GPE
, O
so O
there O
is O
nothing O
left O
to O
do O
but O
to O
pray O
that O
the O
team O
loses O
in O
the O
worst O
defeat O
so O
that O
the O
flow O
of O
women O
will O
automatically O
stop O
or O
that O
the O
cheerleaders O
become O
afflicted O
with O
paralysis O
or O
rickets O
. O
" O

He O
composes O
a O
bad O
thing O
, O
then O
imagines O
the O
reaction O
, O
and O
then O
he O
designs O
funny O
plans O
for O
disclaimer O
. O

The O
goal O
is O
ridicule O
and O
ridicule O
alone O
!! O

Apologies O
for O
publishing O
the O
photos O
because O
of O
their O
necessity O
. O

Whether O
the O
female O
cheerleaders O
are O
Saudis B-NORP
or O
not O
is O
not O
important O
to O
us O
. O

Thankfully O
, O
they O
are O
few O

We O
have O
8441000 B-CARDINAL
women O
who O
are O
all O
good O
, O
keep O
their O
religion O
, O
morals O
, O
and O
their O
veil O
, O
and O
they O
wo O
n't O
be O
harmed O
by O
the O
emergence O
of O
a O
group O
which O
represents O
no O
one O
but O
itself O
. O

But O
what O
is O
disgraceful O
and O
shameful O
is O
to O
welcome O
such O
dishonorable O
sights O
, O
shameful O
clothes O
, O
unrestrained O
hair O
, O
and O
swaying O
, O
while O
we O
see O
girls O
from O
the O
UAE B-GPE
and O
Kuwait B-GPE
in O
the O
grandstand O
of O
their O
teams O
looking O
respectable O
and O
modest O
, O
with O
some O
of O
them O
covering O
their O
faces O
! O

What O
burns O
the O
heart O
is O
the O
eagerness O
of O
some O
cultured O
people O
and O
writers O
to O
harm O
their O
country O
whether O
they O
are O
aware O
or O
unaware O
? O

They O
made O
fun O
of O
us O
in O
front O
of O
all O
the O
nations O
of O
the O
world O
when O
they O
spoke O
about O
Saudi B-NORP
women O
. O

A O
British B-NORP
research O
center O
-LRB- O
STARSH B-ORG
-RRB- O
was O
fair O
to O
them O
in O
its O
annual O
report O
when O
it O
described O
them O
as O
the O
most O
beautiful O
and O
flirtatious O
women O
in O
the O
world O
, O
and O
that O
they O
are O
queens O
of O
the O
world O
whose O
demands O
are O
fulfilled O
without O
any O
trouble O
, O
that O
they O
are O
always O
being O
served O
, O
and O
that O
they O
do O
not O
need O
to O
work O
because O
their O
expenses O
are O
provided O
by O
their O
guardians O
. O

May O
the O
nobles O
excuse O
me O
, O
we O
are O
asking O
Jasir B-PERSON
, O
Will O
we O
see O
your O
wife O
and O
daughter O
in O
the O
grandstand O
of O
the O
national O
team O
? O
Did O
you O
give O
them O
freedom O
and O
liberate O
them O
from O
their O
fear O
, O
and O
free O
their O
soul O
from O
shyness O
? O

Will O
you O
say O
what O
your O
leader O
said O
? O

My O
daughters O
will O
be O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
to O
drive O
a O
car O
!!? O

. O

I O
am O
completely O
reassured O
that O
the O
liberal O
project O
will O
not O
succeed O
in O
this O
country O
, O
praise O
God O
. O

For O
no O
matter O
how O
far O
the O
liberal O
ideological O
lunacy O
has O
affected O
some O
brain O
cells O
of O
the O
young O
, O
it O
will O
never O
be O
able O
to O
affect O
the O
part O
that O
controls O
the O
sense O
of O
honor O
, O
otherwise O
man O
would O
be O
stripped O
of O
his O
values O
and O
would O
become O
like O
an O

, O
a O
cuckold O
. O

He O
wo O
n't O
enter O
paradise O
or O
even O
find O
its O
scent O
! O

That O
's O
why O
you O
find O
them O
the O
most O
caring O
and O
the O
most O
solicitous O
of O
their O
close O
female O
relatives O
. O

You O
will O
never O
see O
in O
the O

a O
daughter O
or O
a O

or O
even O
a O

of O
a O

or O
a O
cultured O

leading O
a O

And O
she O
will O
not O
be O
the O

and O
she O
will O
not O

They O

the O

How O

They O

Second B-ORDINAL

a O
proverb O
says O
-LRB- O
For O
every O

there O
is O
a O
customer O
-RRB- O
meaning O
if O
we O
want O
to O
look O
for O
a O

Saudi B-NORP
dancer O
we O
will O
find O
one O
, O
and O
if O
we O
look O

female O
Saudi B-NORP
singer O
we O
will O
find O
one O

and O
if O
we O

Evil O
is O
not O
restricted O
to O
a O
certain O
class O
of O
people O
, O
and O
Satan O
entices O
people O
. O

But O
because O
there O
is O
a O
little O
discord O
in O
Saudi B-NORP
society O
, O
it O
certainly O
does O
not O
represent O
the O
whole O
and O
it O
does O
not O
represent O
the O
opposing O
public O
opinion O
. O

Rather O
, O
it O
represents O
itself O
and O
those O
who O
belong O
to O
it O
. O

I O
say O
this O
because O
displaying O
the O
photos O
of O
the O
female O
cheerleaders O
whether O
they O
are O
Saudis B-NORP
or O
hired O
, O
and O
anything O
is O
possible O
, O
though O
the O
latter O
is O
more O
likely O
, O
does O
not O
make O
us O
think O
that O
all O
are O
respectable O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
what O
we O
saw O
does O
not O
honor O
us O
Saudis B-NORP
-- O
cheering O
for O
the O
team O
in O
this O
way O
by O
rebelling O
against O
our O
noble O
values O
and O
morals O
.. O

This O
is O
not O
cheering O
, O
but O
rather O
it O
is O
removing O
the O
veil O
for O
its O
own O
sake O
. O

It O
was O
something O
done O
by O
those O
who O
wanted O
to O
do O
it O
. O

Female O
Saudi B-NORP
cheerleaders O
or O
hirelings O
-LRB- O
anything O
is O
possible O
-RRB- O
previously O
cheered O
for O
the O
team O
in O
Kuwait B-GPE
, O
but O
in O
a O
more O
decent O
and O
better O
way O
than O
what O
is O
happening O
now O
. O

This O
is O
a O
photo O
of O
Saudi B-NORP
female O
cheerleaders O
in O
Kuwait B-GPE
. O

If O
we O
assume O
that O
someone O
said O
, O
" O
Why O
the O
twitching O
and O
condemnation O
about O
the O
female O
cheerleaders O
when O
they O
have O
done O
something O
patriotic O
by O
cheering O
and O
supporting O
their O
team O
? O
" O
-LRB- O
This O
is O
the O
custom O
we O
are O
familiar O
with O
from O
Akhzam B-PERSON
Zanim I-PERSON
. O
-RRB- O
We O
would O
say O
that O
cheering O
does O
not O
at O
all O
mean O
renouncing O
virtue O
, O
and O
it O
does O
not O
mean O
candor O
and O
challenging O
values O
and O
morals O
. O

Rather O
, O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
cheer O
without O
being O
exposed O
to O
that O
at O
home O
because O
the O
matches O
are O
broadcast O
. O

If O
it O
were O
said O
, O
" O
But O
we O
see O
all O
the O
teams O
of O
the O
world O
, O
including O
the O
Arab O
teams O
, O
cheered O
by O
their O
citizens O
, O
males O
and O
females O
. O
" O
We O
would O
say O
, O
" O
First B-ORDINAL
of O
all O
, O
we O
are O
Muslims B-NORP
who O
have O
our O
own O
beliefs O
and O
our O
own O
way O
of O
doing O
things O
which O
differ O
from O
those O
of O
others O
. O
We O
have O
to O
pay O
attention O
to O
them O
as O
long O
as O
we O
are O
among O
their O
people O
just O
like O
Hindus B-NORP
with O
their O
cows O
, O
Buddhists B-NORP
with O
their O
idols O
, O
Judaism B-ORG
, O
Christianity B-ORG
, O
and O
others O
.. O
" O

From O
this O
perspective O
, O
we O
are O
not O
forced O
to O
imitate O
others O
, O
and O
no O
matter O
how O
we O
justify O
this O
as O
civilization O
and O
progress O
it O
is O
a O
justification O
from O
the O
dictionary O
of O
Satan O
who O
swore O
" O
I O
will O
beguile O
them O
all O
. O
" O

To O
conclude O
: O
In O
every O
nation O
there O
are O
Banu B-NORP
Saad I-NORP
, O
meaning O
that O
there O
are O
good O
people O
and O
bad O
people O
. O

What O
the O
female O
cheerleaders O
did O
is O
not O
accepted O
by O
their O
fellow O
citizens O
even O
if O
they O
were O
encouraged O
by O
those O
who O
are O
like O
them O
, O
whose O
hearts O
and O
minds O
have O
become O
secularized O
and O
whose O
mania O
became O
the O
imitation O
of O
the O
Semites B-NORP
in O
every O
big O
and O
small O
way O
. O

The O
scandal O
of O
hiring O
wailing O
female O
cheerleaders O
: O
they O
made O
them O
brunettes O
. O

We O
do O
not O
deny O
that O
there O
are O
Saudi B-NORP
women O
who O
go O
out O
and O
show O
us O
how O
pretty O
they O
are O
. O

But O
those O
who O
appear O
in O
the O
photo O
-- O
only O
God O
knows O
whether O
they O
are O
Saudi B-NORP
women O
or O
not O
? O

Perhaps O
some O
of O
them O
are O
Saudi B-NORP
and O
some O
were O
simply O
hired O
to O
support O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
national O
team O
. O

Of O
course O
the O
newspapers O
published O
the O
photos O
by O
way O
of O
another O
thing O
which O
is O
making O
people O
accustomed O
to O
the O
emergence O
of O
Saudi B-NORP
female O
cheerleaders O
. O

In O
the O
past O
, O
we O
did O
not O
see O
Saudi B-NORP
women O
appear O
on O
television O
. O

Then O
Saudi B-NORP
women O
gradually O
started O
to O
appear O
on O
Channel B-ORG
One I-ORG
, O
and O
on O
the O
news O
channel O
which O
originally O
specialized O
in O
allowing O
Saudi B-NORP
women O
to O
appear O
, O
and O
it O
became O
commonplace O
. O

You O
find O
them O
presenting O
girls O
and O
women O
in O
their O
homes O
unveiled O
. O
One B-CARDINAL
may O
be O
an O
engineer O
, O
and O
another O
may O
be O
something O
else O
. O
Until O
the O
appearance O
of O
Saudi B-NORP
women O
on O
our O
television O
channels O
became O
a O
very O
ordinary O
thing O
. O

The O
problem O
now O
is O
that O
even O
women O
wearing O
the O
veil O
and O
who O
are O
fully O
covered O
appear O
on O
the O
news O
channel O
. O

Take O
for O
example O
, O
today O
's O
silly O
question O
which O
they O
primarily O
and O
continuously O
focus O
on O
the O
appearance O
of O
women O
and O
girls O
in O
interviews O
. O

In O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
place O
, O
since O
when O
do O
women O
appear O
as O
far O
as O
we O
are O
concerned O
? O

At O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
the O
man O
was O
shy O
when O
he O
appeared O
. O

But O
now O
we O
see O
women O
appear O
and O
talking O
boldly O
, O
exceeding O
the O
limits O
. O

I O
really O
become O
shy O
when O
I O
see O
them O
-LSB- O
-RSB- O
on O
their O
men O
who O
let O
them O
appear O
on O
the O
Al B-ORG
- I-ORG
Ekhbariya I-ORG
channel O
and O
it O
is O
well O
known O
that O
this O
channel O
deliberately O
does O
this O
thing O
by O
encouraging O
the O
liberation O
of O
women O
through O
interviews O
. O

I O
remember O
that O
once O
Qatar B-GPE
hired O
Moroccan B-NORP
women O
in O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
its O
celebrations O
in O
order O
to O
play O
the O
role O
of O
Gulf B-LOC
girls O
, O
meaning O
that O
in O
each O
song O
about O
a O
Gulf B-LOC
state O
, O
they O
let O
girls O
dance O
. O
As O
if O
they O
were O
from O
those O
states O
, O
although O
in O
some O
of O
the O
Gulf B-LOC
states O
-- O
Bahrain B-GPE
, O
the O
Emirates B-GPE
, O
Oman B-GPE
and O
Kuwait B-GPE
-- O
their O
girls O
have O
appeared O
on O
television O
and O
sung O
and O
danced O
for O
a O
long O
time O
, O
except O
for O
the O
girls O
of O

and O
describing O
it O
using O
the O
worst O
adjectives O
as O
if O
you O
are O
talking O
about O
the O
societies O
of O
the O
West B-LOC
. O

It O
is O
nice O
to O
say O
that O
they O
are O
well O
- O
born O
Saudi B-NORP
women O
and O
from O
well O
- O
known O
tribes O
. O

This O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
your O
lies O
. O

Why O
? O

Did O
you O
see O
their O
identity O
cards O
? O

Or O
just O
to O
say O
" O
Look O
, O
this O
is O
the O
reality O
of O
your O
girls O
. O
" O

By O
no O
means O
do O
we O
deny O
that O
there O
are O
unveiled O
Saudi B-NORP
women O
, O
and O
we O
do O
not O
hold O
our O
society O
to O
be O
free O
of O
faults O
and O
corruption O
. O

But O
thank O
God O
we O
have O
more O
good O
than O
evil O
. O

But O
your O
problem O
is O
that O
you O
are O
looking O
with O
only O
one B-CARDINAL
eye O
, O
the O
eye O
of O
evil O
and O
defects O
. O

------------------------- O

Noble O
brother O
, O
may O
God O
reward O
you O
with O
good O
and O
elevate O
your O
status O
. O

Perhaps O
there O
are O
Saudi B-NORP
women O
among O
them O
but O
the O
majority O
of O
them O
are O
not O
. O

Moreover O
, O
I O
do O
not O
find O
it O
easy O
to O
swallow O
that O
a O
Saudi B-NORP
woman O
would O
uncover O
her O
belly O
, O
God O
forbid O
!! O

Anyway O
, O
the O
aim O
of O
the O
subject O
is O
to O
reply O
to O
Jasir B-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Jasir I-PERSON
, O
this O
poor O
wretch O
who O
has O
shown O
his O
malice O
, O
and O
was O
among O
the O
happiest O
about O
these O
disgusting O
scenes O
. O

------------------------- O

In O
the O
name O
of O
God O
, O
the O
Merciful O
, O
the O
Compassionate O
. O

My O
beloved O
brother O
.. O
may O
God O
reward O
you O
with O
good O
. O

You O
really O
are O
a O
Saudi B-NORP
citizen O
.. O
you O
fear O
for O
your O
country O
and O
your O
society O
from O
the O
male O
and O
female O
corrupters O
. O

May O
God O
grant O
success O
to O
you O
and O
to O
everyone O
else O
who O
are O
earnestly O
concerned O
about O
what O
He O
loves O
and O
approves O
of O
. O

May O
God O
take O
revenge O
on O
those O
who O
are O
scheming O
night O
and O
day O
, O
secretly O
and O
openly O
, O
to O
seduce O
women O
in O
this O
conservative O
Muslim B-NORP
country O
which O
sent O
the O
Spanish B-NORP
minister O
of O
justice O
away O
in O
failure O
after O
the O
men O
stopped O
him O
when O
he O
set O
conditions O
-- O
and O
in O
our O
country O
which O
hosted O
him O
. O

When O
he O
became O
impolite O
, O
he O
was O
halted O
in O
the O
most O
polite O
and O
reasonable O
way O
. O

During O
this O
... O
comes O
the O
match O
between O
our O
Saudi B-NORP
national O
team O
and O
the O
national O
team O
of O
our O
brother O
country O
Qatar B-GPE
.. O

Like O
it O
or O
not O
, O
the O
Qatari B-NORP
people O
are O
the O
twin O
of O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
people O
. O

Actually O
they O
are O
one B-CARDINAL
people O
... O

The O
elite O
are O
the O
people O
of O
Qatar B-GPE
. O

They O
have O
the O
blessings O
of O
a O
conservative O
and O
zealous O
Muslim B-NORP
people O
.. O
even O
if O
something O
else O
is O
wanted O
for O
it O
.. O

I O
watched O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
matches O
that O
day O
... O

The O
first B-ORDINAL
match O
was O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
national O
team O
against O
the O
Bahraini B-NORP
national O
team O
... O

The O
logo O
of O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
team O
was O
green O
and O
white O
, O
like O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
team O
, O
and O
they O
were O
in O
the O
same O
grandstands O
, O
and O
they O
were O
the O
same O
female O
cheerleaders O
. O

That O
is O
, O
the O
one B-CARDINAL
who O
hired O
them O
- O
for O
something O
in O
his O
mind O
- O
brought O
them O
more B-TIME
than I-TIME
one I-TIME
hour I-TIME
before O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
match O
of O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
team O
against O
the O
Bahraini B-NORP
team O
, O
and O
they O
did O
not O
leave O
the O
stadium O
until O
after O
the O
match O
between O
Saudi B-GPE
Arabia I-GPE
and O
Qatar B-GPE
. O

That O
is O
, O
they O
stayed O
at O
the O
stadium O
for O
at B-TIME
least I-TIME
five I-TIME
hours I-TIME
.. O

I O
do O
not O
say O
that O
all O
of O
them O
were O
hired O
, O
but O
rather O
, O
perhaps O
there O
was O
one B-CARDINAL
or O
two B-CARDINAL
or O
even O
ten B-CARDINAL
Saudi B-NORP
women O
. O

But O
the O
one O
who O
rejoices O
when O
the O
camera O
passes O
over O
her O
and O
stands O
up O
and O
jumps O
and O
shouts O
is O
either O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
two B-CARDINAL
: O
. O

The O
first B-ORDINAL
: O
not O
a O
Saudi B-NORP
. O

The O
second B-ORDINAL
: O
a O
Saudi B-NORP
woman O
devoid O
of O
bashfulness O
who O
has O
not O
been O
brought O
up O
well O
by O
her O
parents O
and O
lived O
outside O
Saudi B-GPE
Arabia I-GPE
more O
than O
she O
lived O
inside O
it O
. O

I O
say O
this O
because O
I O
am O
a O
Saudi B-NORP
and O
I O
know O
well O
the O
girls O
of O
my O
country O
. O

No O
matter O
how O
reckless O
a O
Saudi B-NORP
girl O
is O
she O
has O
limits O
at O
which O
she O
stops O
.. O

Those O
in O
the O
grandstands O
crossed O
the O
red O
, O
yellow O
and O
green O
lines O
..... O

This O
is O
not O
done O
by O
Saudi B-NORP
actresses O
and O
singers O
who O
left O
the O
world O
of O
purity O
for O
a O
corrupt O
world O
which O
suits O
the O
life O
they O
have O
chosen O
for O
themselves O
... O

It O
is O
well O
known O
that O
actresses O
and O
singers O
are O
less O
shy O
than O
others O
. O

Has O
anyone O
seen O
a O
singer O
or O
an O
actress O
with O
such O
shamelessness O
?.. O

Despite O
their O
shamelessness O
they O
do O
not O
reach O
this O
degree O
.. O

Finally O
, O
I O
say O
: O
-LRB- O
The B-GPE
Kingdom I-GPE
of I-GPE
Saudi I-GPE
Arabia I-GPE
was O
established O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
words O
of O
God O
, O
on O
the O
words O
of O
His O
messenger B-PERSON
, O
and O
on O
the O
application O
of O
the O
religion O
of O
God O
and O
the O
Sunna B-WORK_OF_ART
of O
His O
messenger B-PERSON
-LRB- O
may O
God O
bless O
him O
and O
grant O
him O
salvation O
-RRB- O
. O
This O
way O
of O
doing O
things O
will O
not O
change O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
liberals O
, O
so O
it O
is O
better O
for O
them O
to O
pursue O
al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Qusaybi I-PERSON
, O
Khalid B-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Harbi I-PERSON
, O
and O
others O
whom O
purity O
and O
virtuousness O
do O
not O
suit O
, O
and O
who O
want O
to O
graze O
like O
cattle O
in O
every O
corrupt O
world O

. O

The O

should O
have O
disapproved O
of O
what O
happened O
in O
the O
grandstands O
, O
but O
unfortunately O

have O

----------------------- O

My O
outstanding O

In O
fact O
, O
I O
am O
displeased O
by O
your O
choices O
-- O
you O
and O
Aba B-PERSON
Lujayn I-PERSON
-- O
for O
instance O
... O
of O
specific O
subjects O

meant O
apparently O
to O
promote O
your O
earnest O
concern O
which O
you O
lack O
in O
your O
heart O
-- O
you O
and O
him O
. O
Because O
you O
choose O
only O
the O
subjects O
which O
get O
the O
interest O
of O
the O
common O
people O
, O
and O
you O
stir O
up O
instincts O
in O
them O
to O
find O
enough O
drum O

beating O
to O
satisfy O
your O
illusion O
-- O
you O
and O
Aba B-PERSON
Lujayn I-PERSON
along O
with O
several O
writers O
.. O

You O
write O
for O
something O
in O
the O
soul O
of O
Yaqub B-PERSON
and O
you O
leave O
the O
real O
issues O
which O
threaten O
Islam B-ORG
and O
Muslims B-NORP
. O

You O
even O
avoid O
replying O
to O
them O
as O
if O
birds O
were O
on O
your O
heads O

You O
have O
been O
exposed O
to O
everyone O
... O

This O
is O
a O
subject O
about O
a O
prince O
.. O

And O
this O
is O
a O
subject O
about O
a O
disreputable O
cheerleader O
.. O

And O
something O
else O
is O
about O
a O
trivial O
issue O
which O
is O
read O
only O
by O
a O
trivial O
person O
or O
one O
deluded O
by O
a O
false O
reputation O
about O
you O

You O
made O
a O
sparkle O
for O
yourselves O

and O
you O
were O
burned O

the O
light O
burned O
you O
because O
you O

on O

we O
have O
more O
than O
those O
who O
dress O

among O
our O
fellow O
citizens O
...... O
or O
do O
you O
deny O
that O
as O
well O

like O
your O
amazing O
selectiveness O
which O
stirs O

The O
main O
point O

This O

your O

My O

get O

ask O
Aba B-PERSON
Lujayn I-PERSON
to O
introduce O
you O
to O
one B-CARDINAL
of O

the O
thieves O
.. O
so O
you O

him O
along O
with O
the O
gang O

can O
become O
like O
the O
economic O

are O
paid O
for O
what O
they O
say O
on O

that O
their O

may O
profit O

May O
God O
guide O
you O
.. O
no O
and O
after O
you O
put O
their O
picture O
.... O
go O
just O
.... O
peeling O
onions O
is O
better O
for O
you O
than O
quackery O
and O
hoodwinking O
, O
you O
bankrupt O

like O
the O
poor O
of O

There O
is O
nothing O

What O
happened O

among O

we O

It O

At O

Thank O
you O

putting O
my O

This O

In O

Gulf B-LOC
championship O
, O
which O
is O
held O
in O
Abu B-GPE
Dhabi I-GPE
, O
wailing O
female O
cheerleaders O
were O
hired O
to O
support O
the O
national O
team O
of O
Saudi B-GPE
Arabia I-GPE
! O

This O
was O
done O
at O
all O
the O
foreign O
championships O
in O
which O
the O
team O
participated O
. O

Because O
we O
are O
a O
conservative O
nation O
which O
does O
not O
accept O
mingling O
between O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
sexes O
, O
women O
and O
everyone O
like O
them O
were O
in O
another O
grandstand O
-- O
not O
the O
one O
for O
the O
cheerleader O
group O
-- O
so O
that O
nothing O
with O
non-praiseworthy O
consequences O
might O
occur O
! O

The O
scandal O
is O
that O
the O
person O
who O
chose O
them O
did O
not O
take O
into O
consideration O
the O
disparity O
in O
specifications O
? O

For O
we O
were O
shown O
girls O
who O
are O
dressed O
in O
a O
revealing O
way O
, O
bending O
and O
drawing O
people O
's O
attention O
, O
blondes O
with O
green O
eyes O
. O

With O
my O
own O
eyes O
, O
I O
saw O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
with O
the O
lower O
part O
of O
her O
abdomen O
revealed O
out O
of O
increased O
enthusiasm O
! O

And O
the O
funny O
thing O
is O
that O
some O
of O
them O
tied O
the O
kaffiyeh O
on O
their O
heads O
! O

Maybe O
prior O
to O
that O
they O
were O
in O
the O
Yemeni B-NORP
team O
grandstand O
, O
before O
they O
moved O
to O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
team O
grandstand O
. O

What O
makes O
one O
weep O
is O
that O
the O
flag O
of O
monotheism O
which O
King O
Abdul B-PERSON
Aziz I-PERSON
carried O
in O
the O
fields O
of O
Jihad O
and O
with O
which O
he O
unified O
the O
country O
is O
wrapped O
around O
the O
waist O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
swaying O
with O
it O
!! O

And O
this O
degradation O
of O
the O
flag O
of O
monotheism O
is O
a O
continuation O
of O
the O
act O
done O
by O
some O
silly O
people O
when O
they O
hung O
it O
in O
the O
house O

prostitution O

My O
brother O
, O
what O
does O
Yemen B-GPE
have O
to O
do O
with O
the O
issue O
now O
? O

Or O
do O
you O
think O
that O
the O
girls O
of O
Yemen B-GPE
are O
loose O
and O
lost O
? O

Think O
the O
matter O
over O
. O

If O
you O
think O
that O
, O
you O
were O
wrong O

please O
apologize O

all O
Yemenis B-NORP

You O
defend O
the O
girls O

Saudi B-GPE

Why O
? O

You O
do O
n't O
like O
it O

the O

you O

I O

striving O

So O
far O
I O
have O
not O

a O
convincing O
explanation O

two B-CARDINAL
incidents O
involving O
one B-CARDINAL
player O
, O
the O
star O
Saad B-PERSON
Al I-PERSON

Harthi I-PERSON
. O

The O
first B-ORDINAL
is O
the O
matter O
of O
his O
call O
up O
to O
the O
national O
team O
after O
he O
clearly O
excelled O
at O
his O
club O
, O
then O
being O
put O
aside O
by O
Mr. O
Paqueta B-PERSON
, O
outside O
the O
formation O
, O
even O
on O
the O
benches O
in O
the O
stadium O
. O

He O
did O
not O
play O
even O
as O
a O
reserve O
, O
nor O
was O
he O
unshackled O
and O
returned O
to O
complete O
his O
university O
studies O
of O
which O
less B-DATE
than I-DATE
two I-DATE
months I-DATE
are O
left O
. O

Acquiring O
an O
education O
remains O
the O
most O
important O
, O
and O
is O
the O
weapon O
that O
covers O
the O
professional O
player O
, O
especially O
as O
Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Harthi I-PERSON
had O
postponed O
it O
more O
than O
once O
, O
all O
during O
his O

the O
Saudi B-NORP

Article O
Six B-CARDINAL
, O
clause O
three B-CARDINAL
of O
the B-LAW
Professional I-LAW
Regulations I-LAW
stipulates O
.. O
that O
the O
professional O
player O
undertakes O
to O
continue O
his O
education O
and O
raise O
his O
cultural O
level O

and O
what O
supports O
the O
need O
to O
look O
into O
Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Harthi I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
return O
is O
that O
Mr. O

six B-CARDINAL

Al B-PERSON

Harthi I-PERSON
and O
all O
of O
them O
took O
part O
in O
the O
last O
two B-CARDINAL
games O
...! O

The O
second B-ORDINAL
incident O
is O
the O
report O
raised O
by O
al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Masibih I-PERSON
to O
His O
Highness O
the O
President O
of O
the O
Union B-ORG
about O
Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Harthi I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
diligence O
and O
his O
readiness O
to O
represent O
the O
homeland O
, O
which O
raises O
a O
wider O
question O
mark O
about O
why O
this O
report O
concerned O
Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Harthi I-PERSON
alone O
? O

Has O
anything O
happened O
in O
the O
past O
that O
would O
contradict O
it O
? O

The O
answer O
from O
all O
the O
fans O
is O
, O
of O
course O
, O
no O
..! O

Or O
is O
there O
someone O
who O
ordered O
that O
this O
report O
be O
submitted O
..? O

What O
are O
his O
motives O
..? O

I O
know O
for O
sure O
that O
someone O
will O
summarize O
everything O
I O
referred O
to O
above O
place O
it O
in O
the O
category O
of O
preferences O
. O

And O
then O
I O
will O
not O
, O
will O
not O
care O
, O
as O
long O
as O
I O
want O
to O
transmit O
a O
fact O
that O
we O
are O
in O
great O
need O
of O
players O
who O
are O
skilled O
with O
their O
brains O
and O
their O
legs O
. O

So O
liberate O
the O
minds O
of O
those O
with O
skilled O
legs O
so O
that O
we O
would O
enjoy O
a O
generation O
blessed O
with O
a O
civilization O
of O
progress O
and O
consciousness O
and O
awareness O

Let O
us O
all O
repeat O
together O
with O

behind O
Jasim O

decisive O
victory O
in O

the O

A O
question O
occurs O
to O
me O

How O
come O
a O
player O
for O
whom O
voted O
55 O
% O
of O
an O
awesome O
number O
of O

the O

on O
the O
basis O
of O
no O
more O

for O
him O
? O

How O
? O

Since O
the O
" O
one O

only O
" O
media O
started O
criticizing O
the O

Paqueta O
heavily O

can O
we O
innocently O
ask O
here O
whether O
this O
media O
has O
become O
a O
" O
middleman O
" O
striving O
for O
Paqueta O
's O
dismissal O
and O
his O
return O
to O
their O

What O
supports O
it O
is O
the O
delay O
in O

contracting O

do O
not O

yourself O
with O
Khaled O

. O

The O
man O

the O
problem O
is O
that O
there O
are O
those O
who O
support O

If O

his O

then O
you O
would O
know O
this O
man O

disease O
. O

Encouragement O
is O
a O
nice O
thing O

However O
fanaticism O

the O

the O

The O

might O
be O
used O
to O
cover O

The O

away O

The O

has O
been O
in O
the O
possession O

the O
American B-NORP

for O
some O
months O
according O
to O
what O

that O

It O
seems O
that O
the O
endorsement O
by O

government O
of O
the O
draft O
bill O
on O
the O
exploitation O
of O

is O
much O
more O
important O
to O
the O

than O
showing O
the O

in O
the O

of O
the O

it O
would O

This O
takes O
us O
back O

something O

This O
is O
what O
arouses O
worry O
at O
the O
time O
of O

in O
the O

of O
the O
general O
collapse O

narrow O
interests O

and O
in O
the O
light O
of O
the O
torn O
national O
unity O
. O

The O
issuing O
of O
the O
new O
oil O
bill O
at O
the O
present O
time O
represents O
an O
introduction O
to O
the O
privatization O
of O
the O

the O
conditions O
drawn O

by O
the O

the B-ORG

It O
is O
not O
in O
the O
interest O
of O
Iraq B-GPE
to O
submit O
to O
these O
conditions O
under O
threat O
and O
intimation O
of O
demands O
for O
the O
former O

. O

The O
Occupation B-EVENT
has O
brought O
Iraq B-GPE
nothing O
but O
destruction O
and O
corruption O
and O
it O
is O
impossible O
to O

except O
by O
the O
strengthening O
the O
internal O
front O
and O
the O
position O
defending O
the O
nation O

Much O
journalistic O
noise O
was O
raised O
abroad O
about O
the O
subject O
of O
the O
oil O
and O
the O
distribution O
of O
its O
revenues O
to O
the O
different O
areas O
of O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

This O
is O
a O
cause O
for O
caution O
, O
because O
the O
subject O
is O
dealt O
with O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
sectarian O
or O
ethnic O
ownership O
of O
the O
oil O
revenues O
, O
at O
a O
time O
when O
the O
question O
of O
public O
participation O
in O
the O
oil O
revenues O
is O
a O
matter O
almost O
decided O
in O
the O
constitution O
despite O
the O
deliberately O
obscure O
wording O
of O
its O
paragraphs O
. O

It O
is O
clear O
that O
the O
agreement O
of O
the O
current O
regime O
forces O
occurred O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
general O
participation O
in O
the O
oil O
resources O
according O
to O
the O
proportion O
of O
the O
population O
in O
the O
regions O
. O

Even O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
Kurdish B-NORP
national O
parties O
know O
that O
the O
greater O
part O
of O
the O
resources O
is O
situated O
in O
the O
South B-LOC
and O
that O
their O
guarantee O
of O
obtaining O
a O
high O
level O
of O
the O
revenue O
will O
only O
happen O
through O
the O
sharing O
of O
Iraqi B-NORP
resources O
as O
a O
whole O
. O

As O
such O
, O
the O
exclusion O
of O
an O

is O
not O
the O

The O
fact O
is O
that O
the O
oil O

are O
still O

the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
in O

with O
the O
Security B-ORG
Council I-ORG
resolutions O
and O
, O
consequently O
, O
any O
agreement O
between O
the O
central O
government O
and O
the O
regions O
about O
the O
distribution O
of O
oil O
revenues O
will O
be O
subject O
to O
the O
guarantee O
of O
the O
US B-GPE
hegemony O
. O

The O
subject O
of O
oil O
from O
a O
sectarian O
or O
regional O
point O
of O
view O
was O
not O
presented O
except O
as O
a O
cover O
for O
the O
important O
main O
questions O
about O
the O
oil O
policy O
, O
these O
being O
Firstly B-ORDINAL
: O
the O
abrogation O
of O
Act B-LAW
80 I-LAW
-LRB- O
1961 B-DATE
-RRB- O
and O
its O
cancellation O
, O
by O
successively O
handing O
over O
unexploited O
oilfields O
and O
areas O
to O
foreign O
companies O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
long O
- O
term O
participation O
in O
production O
contracts O
, O
instead O
of O
developing O
them O
nationally O
by O
supporting O
the O
national O
oil O
companies O
and O
making O
use O
of O
foreign O
expertise O
through O
short O
- O
term O
service O
contracts O
that O
would O
leave O
the O
wealth O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
's O
hands O
. O
Secondly B-ORDINAL
: O
the O
weakening O
of O
the O
Iraq B-GPE
's O
negotiating O

power O
by O
weakening O
the O
centralization O
of O
contracting O
for O
the O
national O
resources O
with O
foreign O
companies O
and O
the O
instruments O
of O
such O
contracting O
; O
not O
distinguishing O
between O
the O
need O
to O
expand O
the O
administrative O
powers O
of O
the O
companies O
and O
institutions O
on O
the O
one B-CARDINAL
hand O
, O
and O
the O
need O
for O
the O
centralization O
of O
the O
major O
national O
economic O
decisions O
on O
the O
other O
. O

It O
is O
illogical O
for O
the O
decision O
about O
a O
specific O
oilfield O
to O
be O
made O
centrally O
and O
the O
decision O
on O
another O
oilfield O
to O
be O
made O
locally O
, O
as O
this O
mixes O
jurisdictions O
and O
divides O
power O
solely O
at O
the O
expense O
of O
public O
interest O
. O

The O
privatization O
of O
the O
oilfields O
and O
new O
oil O
areas O
weakens O
the O
currently O
existing O
national O
oil O
industry O
. O

The O
issue O
is O
not O
just O
that O
of O
the O
provision O
of O
financial O
capabilities O
for O
investment O
in O
the O
national O
sector O
or O
lack O
of O
them O
, O
but O
extends O
beyond O
that O
to O
reliance O
on O
policies O
for O
developing O
Iraqi B-NORP
technological O
and O
administrative O
capacities O
instead O
of O
relying O
on O
foreign O
companies O
. O

Technology O
does O
not O
develop O
in O
isolation O
from O
the O
ability O
to O
make O
decisions O
and O
in O
isolation O
from O
its O
relation O
with O
society O
and O
its O
institutions O
. O

Foreign O
companies O
can O
come O
and O
go O
without O
any O
advanced O
technology O
establishing O
itself O
in O
the O
country O
. O

What O
is O
therefore O
needed O
is O
a O
national O
oil O
industry O
, O
including O
a O
national O
private O
sector O
offering O
technical O
oil O
services O
, O
and O
this O
is O
what O
was O
not O
developed O
during O
the O
previous O
regime O
and O
what O
will O
hamper O
it O
as O
well O
is O
the O
reliance O
on O
foreign O
companies O
. O

Fourthly B-ORDINAL
: O
achieving O
an O
integrated O
oil O
policy O
in O
regards O
to O
the O
exploitation O
of O
the O
national O
gas O
resources O
and O
linking O
it O
with O
the O
production O
of O
electricity O
, O
oil O
refining O
, O
the O
development O
of O
different O
petrochemical O
industries O
, O
and O
industries O
reliant O
on O
intensive O
energy O
use O
. O

On O
this O
basis O
, O
one O
must O
caution O
against O
companies O
that O
try O
to O
invest O
in O
the O
production O
of O
crude O
oil O
without O
being O
prepared O
to O
invest O
in O
the O
associated O
and O
complementary O
industries O
. O

Iraq B-GPE
suffered O
a O
lot O
from O
this O
situation O
before O
nationalization O
. O

Fifthly B-ORDINAL
: O
the O
crude O
oil O
production O
sector O
is O
not O
just O
that O
of O
the O
production O
fields O
, O
but O
that O
of O
facilities O
and O
complex O
production O
services O
and O
of O
cargo O
and O
transport O
services O
that O
require O
a O
wide O
inter-governorate O
network O
in O
which O
different O
production O
units O
in O
the O
country O
participate O
. O

This O
requires O
a O
national O
oil O
policy O
. O

Practical O
experience O
shows O
that O
following O
the O
market O
system O
in O
the O
sphere O
of O
public O
facilities O
is O
an O
extremely O
difficult O
administrative O
matter O
and O
failure O
in O
it O
is O
almost O
certain O
. O

It O
is O
better O
to O
keep O
these O
facilities O
under O
public O
administration O
in O
all O
circumstances O
, O
and O
work O
to O
develop O
the O
administrative O
capabilities O
. O

A O
unified O
national O
policy O
is O
an O
unavoidable O
necessity O
, O
and O
regressing O
on O
it O
would O
compromise O
national O
interests O
. O

Sixthly B-ORDINAL
: O
Break O
the O
relationship O
between O
oil O
and O
national O
economic O
development O
, O
because O
bringing O
up O
the O
question O
of O
distribution O
equity O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
dividing O
oil O
revenues O
among O
the O
regions O
in O
accordance O
with O
population O
ratios O
is O
a O
concept O
to O
a O
large O
extent O
incompatible O
with O
that O
of O
exploiting O
oil O
resources O
for O
development O
. O

The O
important O
thing O
is O
to O
move O
towards O
investment O
in O
a O
way O
that O
will O
encourage O
the O
unemployed O
production O
capacities O
, O
and O
that O
will O
provide O
the O
necessary O
conditions O
for O
an O
effective O
, O
private O
national O
activity O
, O
not O
one O
that O
relies O
fully O
on O
deals O
and O
contracts O
with O
the O
government O
, O
whether O
local O
or O
central O
. O

This O
kind O
of O
developmental O
activity O
can O
not O
be O
based O
in O
a O
single O
region O
or O
governorate O
; O
instead O
it O
requires O
coordination O
in O
accordance O
with O
a O
general O
national O
program O
. O

The O
important O
thing O
is O
not O
the O
equitable O
distribution O
of O
investment O
but O
the O
equitable O
and O
fair O
distribution O
of O
the O
benefits O
of O
the O
investment O
. O

As O
we O
know O
, O
most O
of O
the O
financial O
investments O
made O
by O
the B-ORG
Reconstruction I-ORG
Council I-ORG
were O
in O
the O
northern O
region O
but O
the O
most O
significant O
impact O
of O
its O
benefits O
was O
on O
other O
areas O
. O

This O
was O
also O
the O
case O
with O
many O
of O
the O
investments O
in O
the B-DATE
seventies I-DATE
, O
as O
the O
greatest O
part O
of O
the O
major O
oil O
and O
industrial O
projects O
, O
the O
oil O
projects O
and O
the O
ports O
are O
in O
the O
southern O
region O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
benefits O
would O
have O
encompassed O
all O
if O
it O
was O
n't O
for O
the O
destruction O
that O
resulted O
from O
the O
wars O
started O
by O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
. O

The O
most O
important O
thing O
then O
is O
integration O
and O
striving O
to O
provide O
the O
minimum O
level O
of O
basic O
needs O
in O
terms O
of O
food O
, O
accommodation O
, O
education O
and O
health O
for O
all O
the O
citizens O
without O
discrimination O
. O

It O
is O
unreasonable O
for O
us O
to O
seek O
solutions O
to O
the O
electricity O
problem O
for O
each O
governorate O
, O
or O
that O
we O
have O
local O
water O
policies O
in O
Mesopotamia B-GPE
. O

Seventh B-ORDINAL
: O
discussions O
are O
to O
be O
held O
about O
the O
cash O
distribution O
of O
part O
of O
the O
oil O
revenue O
, O

and O
this O
too O
will O
not O
lead O
to O
equity O
, O
nor O
to O
development O
and O
attaining O
public O
interest O
. O

It O
is O
well O
known O
that O
the O
notion O
of O
the O
individual O
cash O
share O
from O
oil O
revenues O
is O
an O
alternative O
to O
the O
provisions O
ration O
, O
and O
not O
a O
supplement O
to O
it O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
effect O
of O
this O
change O
on O
inflation O
and O
on O
the O
extent O
the O
minimum O
level O
of O
basic O
needs O
would O
be O
provided O
for O
the O
poor O
sectors O
will O
be O
negative O
, O
and O
will O
have O
inherently O
harmful O
economic O
effects O
in O
the O
present O
period O
due O
to O
the O
lack O
of O
conditions O
for O
productive O
economic O
activity O
. O

Also O
making O
this O
change O
could O
provide O
an O
additional O
opportunity O
for O
corruption O
in O
implementation O
. O

The O
idea O
is O
drawn O
from O
the O
experience O
of O
the O
US B-GPE
State O
of O
Alaska B-GPE
, O
and O
it O
means O
moving O
away O
from O
public O
investments O
even O
in O
the O
vital O
sectors O
, O
as O
it O
is O
an O
alternative O
to O
providing O
electricity O
, O
water O
, O
health O
services O
and O
public O
education O
at O
affordable O
conditions O
and O
prices O
. O

Finally O
, O
oil O
policy O
will O
be O
an O
important O
part O
of O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
national O
state O
reconstruction O
and O
its O
rise O
from O
the O
present O
destruction O
. O

The O
invitation O
is O
going O
out O
to O
all O
Iraqi B-NORP
patriots O
of O
various O
political O
and O
social O
hues O
who O
believe O
in O
the O
current O
political O
process O
and O
those O
who O
are O
outside O
it O
, O
and O
to O
the O
local O
and O
civil O
community O
in O
general O
, O
to O
reject O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
new O
oil O
bill O
being O
issued O
at O
the O
present O
time O
and O
for O
it O
to O
be O
postponed O
for O
at B-DATE

a I-DATE

year I-DATE
to O
start O
the O
debate O
about O
the O
future O
of O
the O
oil O
policy O
that O
stresses O
peace O
and O
the O
ending O
of O
the O
occupation O
as O
the O
basic O
requirements O
for O
a O
national O
oil O
policy O
. O

As O
for O
bringing O
up O
hopes O
of O
speedy O
prosperity O
by O
accelerating O
production O
using O
foreign O
companies O
, O
that O
is O
a O
mirage O
as O
the O
companies O
will O
not O
come O
except O
under O
favorably O
secure O
conditions O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
main O
economic O
problems O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
currently O
do O
not O
lie O
in O
the O
diminished O
oil O
revenue O
, O
but O
in O
the O
occupation O

the O

, O
the O
widespread O

the O

the O

How O
