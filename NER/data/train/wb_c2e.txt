After O

hundreds B-CARDINAL

turned O

Since O

the O

bordered O

China B-GPE

our O

If O
we O

- O
called O

that O
is O
not O
in O

with O
the O

what O

China B-GPE
could O

fall O
into O
a O
situation O

rule O

or O
civil O

When O
that O

the O

will O
pale O
by O

it O
will O
be O
too O
late O

Then O
there O
will O
be O
no O

for O
America B-GPE

Japan B-GPE
to O
attack O
us O
, O
we O
'll O
be O
too O
busy O

each O
other O
. O

We O
wo O
n't O
need O
to O
be O
concerned O
with O
Taiwan B-GPE
; O
even O
the O
Northeast O
will O
be O
independent O

Let O
's O
say O
it O
again O
: O
it O
suits O
the O
interests O
of O
the O
West B-LOC
for O
China B-GPE
to O
become O
a O
disunited O
country O
with O
no O
production O
capacity O
and O
no O
fighting O
ability O
. O

But O
so O
- O
called O
democracy O
is O
just O
a O
talking O
point O
; O
some O
people O
take O
democracy O
as O
the O
ultimate O
form O
of O
morality O
, O
cloaking O
themselves O
in O
democracy O
in O
order O
to O
buy O

. O

Promoting O

at O

sounds O
better O
than O
promoting O
China B-GPE

return O
to O
a O
feudal O
empire O

[lightblue] O
Yao O
Ming O
and O
McGrady O
are O
two O
major O
sharp O
weapons O
of O
the O
Rockets O
. O

The O
key O
is O
how O
they O
are O
used O
, O
instead O
of O
being O
compared O
blindly O
. O

[lightblue] O
Neither O
those O
hating O
Yao O
nor O
those O
loving O
Yao O
make O
any O
sense O
. O

[lightblue] O
One O
is O
a O
center O
and O
the O
other O
is O
a O
point O
guard O
, O
which O
are O
totally O
not O
comparable O
. O

[lightblue] O
As O
for O
who O
contributes O
more O
to O
the O
team O
, O
it O
mainly O
depends O
on O
who O
the O
opponents O
are O
and O
which O
set O
of O
tactics O
the O
whole O
team O
play O
. O

[lightblue] O
Yao O
Ming O
and O
McGrady O
are O
both O
treasures O
to O
the O
team O
of O
the O
Rockets O
. O

It O
hinges O
primarily O
on O
how O
they O
are O
used O
, O
just O
like O
the O
fighter O
and O
the O
bomber O
in O
the O
air O
force O
, O
where O
it O
all O
depends O
on O
what O
battle O
is O
fight O
and O
with O
whom O
. O

[lightblue] O
It O
is O
my O
belief O
that O
the O
Rockets O
can O
not O
just O
have O
one O
set O
of O
tactics O
, O
for O
example O
only O
revolving O
around O
Yao O
Ming O
or O
revolving O
around O
McGrady O
when O
they O
play O
. O

[lightblue] O
You O
have O
to O
see O
what O
type O
of O
team O
your O
opponents O
are O
, O
how O
strong O
their O
center O
is O
and O
how O
strong O
they O
are O
outside O
, O
before O
you O
decide O
whether O
to O
play O
Yao O
Ming O
or O
McGrady O
, O
or O
half O
Yao O
Ming O
and O
half O
McGrady O
. O

[lightblue] O
It O
now O
proves O
that O
other O
players O
of O
the O
Rockets O
are O
not O
weak O
, O
in O
which O
case O
it O
is O
not O
necessary O
to O
let O
Yao O
Ming O
play O
too O
much O
. O

Simply O
let O
him O
get O
a O
good O
rest O
in O
the O
first O
two O
quarters O
and O
allow O
the O
shooters O
to O
score O
. O

[lightblue] O
One O
characteristic O
of O
spot O
- O
up O
shooters O
is O
that O
they O
tend O
to O
become O
less O
precise O
as O
the O
match O
goes O
on O
. O

At O
this O
time O
, O
an O
energetic O
Yao O
Ming O
should O
be O
released O
to O
score O
in O
the O
paint O
nine O
chances O
out O
of O
ten O
. O

[lightblue] O
The O
opponents O
will O
also O
certainly O
be O
less O
precise O
outside O
in O
the O
second O
half O
and O
they O
can O
not O
match O
Yao O
Ming O
in O
the O
paint O
. O

Would O
n't O
the O
Rockets O
secure O
victory O
this O
way O
? O

That O

[vanmark] O
: O
Yao O
Ming O

are O
two O
major O
sharp O
weapons O
of O
the O

. O

The O
key O
is O
how O
they O
are O

instead O

being O

Neither O
those O
hating O
Yao O

those O

make O
any O
sense O

[vanmark] O

One O

a O

As O
for O
who O
contributes O
more O
to O
the O

, O
it O
mainly O
depends O
on O
who O
the O
opponents O
are O

[vanmark] O
: O
which O
set O

the O

Yao O
Ming O

McGrady O
are O
both O
treasures O
to O
the O

It O
hinges O
primarily O
on O
how O
they O

just O

the O

can O
not O

have O
one O

for O

only O
revolving O

How O
Should O

Amy B-PERSON

Who O
does O
n't O
want O
soft O
, O
white O
skin O
? O

But O
in O
real O
life O
our O
skin O
often O
gives O
us O
a O
hard O
time O
. O

If O
it O
's O
not O
darkness O
or O
redness O
in O
the O
face O
, O
it O
's O
dull O
and O
pallid O
. O

What O
can O
we O
do O
? O

Appropriately O
adjusting O
our O
diet O
could O
bring O
great O
improvements O
for O
our O
skin O
. O

Whatever O
is O
the O
problem O
with O
your O
skin O
, O
you O
should O
prescribe O
" O
vegetables O
" O
based O
on O
your O
symptom O
. O

Red O
face O
: O
this O
is O
caused O
by O
absorbing O
too O
much O
animal O
fat O
or O
protein O
. O

The O
way O
to O
treat O
this O
is O
: O
when O
we O
eat O
foods O
containing O
animal O
fat O
or O
protein O
, O
we O
must O
supplement O
it O
with O
vegetables O
that O
contain O
plenty O
of O
chlorophyll O
, O
like O
spinach O
, O
celery O
or O
lettuce O
. O

If O
we O
eat O
them O
raw O
, O
the O
effect O
is O
better O
. O

We O
can O
also O
chop O
vegetables O
into O
tiny O
bits O
, O
wrap O
them O
in O
cloth O
, O
squeeze O
the O
juice O
and O
drink O
it O
. O

Flushed O
face O
: O
the O
reason O
is O
poor O
circulation O
of O
blood O
, O
particularly O
a O
lack O
of O
blood O
flow O
to O
the O
epithelial O
cells O
. O

When O
the O
weather O
is O
cold O
, O
people O
's O
faces O
go O
red O
, O
particularly O
the O
tips O
of O
their O
noses O
. O

The O
way O
to O
treat O
this O
is O
: O
1. B-CARDINAL
Frequently O
bathe O
and O
massage O
to O
make O
the O
blood O
flow O
freely O
. O

Massage O
the O
red O
parts O
more O
. O

2. B-CARDINAL
To O
make O
the O
body O
fully O
absorb O
proteins O
better O
, O
we O
should O
eat O
plenty O
of O
food O
containing O
vitamin O
B1 B-CARDINAL
and O
vitamin O
C O
. O

We O
can O
improve O
our O
absorption O
of O
vitamin O
D O
by O
exposure O
to O
sunlight O
. O

Oily O
dark O
face O
: O
this O
is O
caused O
by O
consuming O
too O
many O
animal O
oils O
and O
vegetable O
oils O
. O

The O
way O
to O
treat O
this O
is O
: O
control O
the O
amount O
of O
animal O
and O
vegetable O
oils O
we O
consume O
and O
eat O
more O
vegetables O
containing O
chlorophyll O
. O

Before O
we O
eat O
, O
we O
should O
drink O
a O
glass O
of O
vegetable O
juice O
diluted O
with O
warm O
boiled O
water O
. O

The O
effect O
will O
be O
better O
. O

Dark O
face O
: O
generally O
speaking O
, O
the O
skin O
of O
people O
who O
consume O
too O
much O
salt O
is O
rough O
and O
dark O
. O

After O
exposure O
to O
the O
sun O
it O
is O
even O
worse O
. O

The O
hands O
and O
feet O
going O
black O
is O
caused O
by O
the O
salt O
in O
the O
body O
needing O
to O
be O
flushed O
out O
through O
the O
extremities O
. O

If O
we O
consume O
too O
much O
salt O
, O
our O
face O
will O
gradually O
be O
covered O
with O
a O
layer O
of O
dark O
skin O
. O

The O
way O
to O
treat O
this O
is O
: O
1. B-CARDINAL
control O
our O
intake O
of O
salt O
, O
drink O
plenty O
of O
water O
to O
flush O
out O
the O
salt O
through O
our O
urine O
. O

2. B-CARDINAL
Bathing O
frequently O
, O
and O
soaking O
in O
the O
bathroom O
until O
you O
sweat O
, O
can O
also O
help O
to O
flush O
out O
some O
salt O
. O

Freckles O
on O
the O
face O
: O
consuming O
too O
much O
salt O
may O
cause O
freckles O
to O
appear O
on O
the O
face O
. O

And O
if O
in O
our O
diet O
we O
only O
absorb O
animal O
fats O
and O
protein O
, O
this O
will O
affect O
the O
normal O
functioning O
of O
liver O
and O
make O
the O
freckles O
more O
visible O
. O

So O
those O
with O
freckles O
must O
eat O
plenty O
of O
fruit O
and O
vegetables O
. O

As O
well O
as O
this O
, O
medicine O
is O
the O
great O
enemy O
of O
the O
skin O
. O

Sedatives O
in O
particular O
will O
make O
the O
body O
produce O
too O
much O
acid O
. O

The O
hormones O
will O
become O
unbalanced O
and O
freckles O
will O
appear O
on O
the O
face O

Thirdly B-ORDINAL
, O
according O
to O
a O
1998 B-DATE
audit O
report O

when O
Shandong B-GPE
Luneng B-ORG
Group I-ORG

2.6 B-MONEY

A O
more O
concrete O
image O
is O
" O
just O
five B-CARDINAL

In O
this O
process O
, O
where O
did O
Luneng B-ORG
Group I-ORG
get O
its O

opportunities O
for O
expansion O
? O

Luneng B-ORG
's O
background O
and O
Luneng B-ORG

" O
birth O
" O
are O
inseparable O
from O
the O
state O

of O
the O

The O

occupies O
a O
market O
position O
of O
natural O

During O
Luneng B-ORG

rapid O
expansion O
, O
how O
much O
" O
blood O
" O
it O
actually O
extracted O

seems O
to O
be O
a O

cloudy O
issue O

" O

What O
's O
the O
idea O
with O
scrambling O

" O
complete O
" O
privatization O
before O
this O

cleared O
up O

handed O

Fourthly B-ORDINAL
, O
it O
's O
said O
that O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
private O

Guoyuan B-ORG

Shouda B-ORG

-- O
according O
to O
descriptions O
in O
the O

these O
two B-CARDINAL
companies O
can O
be O
called O
" O
low O
profile O
" O

" O
mysterious O

" O

If O
it O
was O
an O
open O

above O

" O
assumption O
of O

" O
then O
why O
the O
" O
mystery O

" O
Why O
the O

low O

According O
to O
reports O
, O
the O
origins O

backgrounds O

sources O
of O

for O
these O
two B-CARDINAL
companies O
are O
completely O
beyond O

Is O
it O
possible O
that O
by O
some O
kind O
of O
" O
buying O

process O
they O
have O
embezzled O
state O

Fifthly B-ORDINAL
, O
the O
departments O
supervising O
state O

the O
electricity O
industry O
are O
SASAC B-ORG

SERC B-ORG

respectively O

But O
with O
Shandong B-GPE
Luneng B-ORG
Group I-ORG
undergoing O

they O
say O
they O
" O

But O
what O
's O
strange O
is O
that O
according O
to O
reports O
by O
journalists O
, O
Luneng B-ORG
Group I-ORG

business O
registration O
has O
in O

What O

more O

since O
November B-DATE
2006 I-DATE
, O
Shandong B-ORG

" O

What O
on O
earth O
does O
this O
mean O
? O

Is O
it O
the O
Caijing B-ORG
reporter O
" O
making O
rumors O
, O
" O
or O
are O
the O
relevant O
departments O

No O

how O
it O

now O
that O

there O

So O
, O
who O

I O

saw O
a O
" O

" O
article O
from O
China B-ORG
Business I-ORG

: O
" O
Guangzhou B-GPE
to O

" O
<http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2007-01-04/051211947888.shtml> O
. O

It O
says O
that O
the O
mayor O
of O
Guangzhou B-GPE
has O
said O
that O
calculated O
by O
the O
number O
of O
people O
registered O
as O
residents O
, O
the O
GDP O
per O
capita O
of O
Guangzhou B-GPE
this B-DATE
year I-DATE
will O
exceed O
10,000 B-MONEY
US I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
. O

The O
reason O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
strange O
was O
because O
according O
to O
some O
data O
that O
I O
already O
knew O
about O
<http://www.williamlong.info/archives/459.html> O
, O
Guangzhou B-GPE
's O
GDP O
per O

should O
only O
reach O
the O
target O
of O
10,000 B-MONEY
US I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
in O
2010 B-DATE
. O

Even O
though O
the O
RMB O
has O
increased O
in O
value O
, O
it O
still O
could O
n't O
be O
this O
fast O
. O

This O
figure O
must O
have O
something O
wrong O
with O
it O
. O

And O
the O
reason O
for O
the O
problem O
was O
still O
the O
population O
figure O
. O

Shenzhen B-GPE
and O
other O
cities O
all O
calculate O
GDP O
per O
capita O
using O
the O
permanent O
resident O
population O
in O
the O
calculation O
. O

For O
cities O
with O
such O
large O
migrant O
populations O
, O
a O
GDP O
per O
capita O
calculated O
using O
the O
number O
of O
registered O
residents O
will O
be O
very O
inaccurate O
. O

If O
Guangzhou B-GPE
calculates O
the O
GDP O
per O
capita O
using O
the O
permanent O
resident O
population O
, O
it O
's O
obviously O
puffing O
itself O
up O
. O

People O
from O
Guangdong B-GPE
are O
usually O
very O
low O
- O
key O
about O
wealth O
. O

They O
'd O
never O
compare O
these O
vanities O
with O
Beijing B-GPE
or O
Shanghai B-GPE
. O

This O
way O
, O
they O
can O
pay O
a O
little O
less O
tax O
to O
the O
central O
authorities O
: O
keeping O
quiet O
to O
get O
rich O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
everyone O
is O
very O
clear O
about O
the O
situations O
in O
Guangzhou B-GPE
and O
Shenzhen B-GPE
. O

For O
many O
years O
Guangzhou B-GPE
has O
been O
just O
a O
little O
behind O
Shenzhen B-GPE
in O
its O
economic O
indices O
and O
all O
aspects O
. O

Its O
GDP O
will O
soon O
be O
exceeded O
by O
Shenzhen B-GPE
's O
, O
yet O
its O
population O
has O
always O
been O
higher O
than O
Shenzhen B-GPE

" O

Shenzhen B-GPE
's O
GDP O
per O

is O
calculated O
using O
the O
number O
of O
permanent O

, O
and O
it O
is O
predicted O
that O
it O
wo O
n't O
top O
10,000 B-MONEY
US I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
until O
about B-DATE
2008 I-DATE
. O

How O
could O
Guangzhou B-GPE
's O
leaders O
make O
this O
kind O
of O
wild O
assertion O
? O

This O
kind O
of O
showing O
off O
has O
never O
been O
the O
style O
of O
people O
from O
Guangdong B-GPE
. O

Various O
signs O
show O
that O
the O
new O
team O
of O
leaders O
in O
Guangzhou B-GPE
may O
have O
been O
transferred O
from O
another O
region O
. O

They O
tend O
to O
like O
boasting O
and O
like O
playing O
number O
games O
to O
seek O
rewards O
from O
the O
central O
authorities O
. O

If O
this O
really O
is O
the O
case O
, O
then O
Guangzhou B-GPE
's O
prospects O
for O
economic O
development O
may O
be O
indeed O
not O
good O
. O

Fewer O
empty O
words O
and O
more O
real O
action O
has O
always O
been O
the O
straightforward O
style O
of O
people O
from O
Guangdong B-GPE
. O

Only O
by O
keeping O
the O
wealth O
among O
the O
people O
can O
a O
nation O
be O
ultimately O
rich O
. O

Making O
the O
majority O
of O
people O
rich O
is O
the O
most O
important O
. O

I O
hope O
the O
new O
team O
of O
leaders O
in O
Guangzhou B-GPE
will O
carefully O
learn O
from O
the O
experiences O
and O
lessons O
of O
the O
last O
few O
administrations O
and O
not O
to O
rival O
with O
places O
like O
Beijing B-GPE
and O
Shanghai B-GPE
in O
exaggeration O
. O

Otherwise O
Guangzhou B-GPE
's O
development O
will O
really O
be O
a O
cause O
for O
worry O

see O
all O
sorts O
of O
mysteries O
of O
politics O
. O

This O
gives O
us O
nothing O
but O
confusions O
and O
concerns O
. O

How O
could O
there O
be O
such O
a O
weird O
phenomenon O
under O
the O
communist O
leadership O
? O

We O
are O
puzzled O
! O

After O
seeing O
the O
remarks O
of O
an O
auditor O
- O
general O
, O
I O
am O
finally O
a O
little O
enlightened O
on O
the O
mysteries O
of O
the O
" O
Fenghua B-LOC
Garden I-LOC
phenomenon O
. O
" O

The O
insightful O
opinion O
of O
this O
insightful O
person O
is O
indeed O
penetrating O
, O
" O
there O
is O
no O
law O
- O
abiding O
community O
association O
in O
Xuzhou B-GPE
. O
" O

This O
is O
the O
auditor O
's O
conclusion O
from O
the O
auditor O
- O
general O
after O
auditing O
the O
embezzlement O
of O
Fenghua B-LOC
Garden I-LOC
properties O
by O
the B-ORG
Community I-ORG
Association I-ORG
, O
which O
says O
there O
is O
no O
law O
- O
abiding O
community O
association O
. O

Therefore O
, O
be O
it O
embezzlement O
or O
robbery O
, O
there O
's O
no O
surprise O
. O

God O
! O
It O
really O
makes O
you O
tremble O
with O
fear O
when O
such O
words O
are O
uttered O
by O
a O
communist B-NORP
official O
specializing O
in O
auditing O
. O

How O
are O
the O
fundamental O
purposes O
of O
the B-ORG
Chinese I-ORG
Communist I-ORG
Party I-ORG
implemented O
among O
officials O
, O
media O
, O
procuratorate O
, O
court O
and O
government O
in O
Xuzhou B-GPE
? O

No O
wonder O
the O
media O
are O
afraid O
of O
releasing O
the O
actual O
situation O
at O
the B-LOC
Fenghua I-LOC
Garden I-LOC
. O

You O
, O
leaders O
of O
the O
legal O
and O
political O
communities O
educated O
by O
the O
Party B-ORG
, O
do O
n't O
you O
feel O
the O
severity O
of O
the O
problem O
? O

The B-ORG
community I-ORG
association I-ORG
is O
a O
grass O
- O
root O
organization O
of O
the O
Party B-ORG
, O
which O
also O
hosts O
the B-ORG
Party I-ORG
Branch I-ORG

The B-ORG
community I-ORG

does O
not O
obey O
the O
law O
, O
and O
even O
deliberately O
break O
the O
law O
, O
seizing O

looting O
properties O
of O

and O
beating O
others O
in O
retaliation O
, O
coupled O
with O
the O
police O
's O
involvement O
in O
beating O
others O
. O

These O
have O
deeply O
hurt O
people O
's O
hearts O
and O
will O
lead O
to O
a O
loss O
of O
support O
of O
people O
over O
time O
. O

This O
is O
a O
major O
issue O
crucial O
to O
the O
life O
and O
death O
of O
the O
Party B-ORG
and O
the O
nation O
, O
which O
no O
communists B-NORP

Specifically O

n't O
it O
? O

Can O
I O
be O
reimbursed O
when O
they O
become O
examination O
questions O
[handldk] O
: O
later O
? O

No O
matter O
how O
interesting O
and O
valuable O
the O
conference O
is O
, O
I O
'm O
not O
going O
to O
attend O
one O
that O
is O
so O
expensive O
. O

Besides O
, O
I O
'm O
really O
wondering O
[handldk] O
: O
if O
there O
are O
any O
Chinese O
peers O
presenting O
at O
such O
a O
conference O
and O
how O
much O
they O
pay O
? O

[jilian] O
The O
New O
Year O
has O
just O
passed O
, O
and O
the O
news O
comes O
that O
beginning O
on O
April O
1 O
, O
2007 O
, O
Russia O
will O
completely O
prohibit O
foreigners O
from O
working O
in O
retail O
; O
by O
the O
end O
of O
2007 O
, O
all O
non-permanent O
points O
of O
business O
will O
be O
eliminated O
. O

[jilian] O
This O
implies O
that O
Chinese O
in O
Russia O
will O
be O
forced O
to O
leave O
the O
country O
, O
and O
they O
will O
suffer O
inestimable O
moral O
and O
financial O
losses O
. O

[jilian] O
Folks O
on O
the O
Internet O
have O
reacted O
furiously O
to O
this O
, O
and O
some O
have O
gotten O
emotional O
and O
very O
angry O
. O

[jilian] O
Others O
are O
shouting O
that O
we O
need O
this O
Russian O
ally O
of O
ours O
and O
must O
not O
cast O
off O
that O
friendship O
over O
a O
small O
matter O
, O
and O
we O
ca O
n't O
get O
Russia O
angry O
. O

[jilian] O
The O
response O
on O
the O
Internet O
has O
been O
a O
dispute O
rarely O
seen O
in O
the O
forums O
. O

[jilian] O
Right O
now O
, O
people O
are O
focusing O
their O
attention O
more O
on O
the O
government O
and O
the O
foreign O
ministry O
, O
expecting O
the O
government O
to O
step O
up O
and O
take O
some O
action O
to O
resolve O
this O
expulsion O
of O
Chinese O
that O
the O
world O
is O
watching O
. O

[jilian] O
However O
, O
the O
views O
of O
the O
Chinese O
embassy O
in O
Russia O
on O
this O
matter O
, O
obtained O
through O
Internet O
channels O
, O
gives O
one O
pause O
: O

[jilian] O
" O
With O
regard O
to O
Russia O
's O
newly O
revised O
immigration O
law O
, O
" O
says O
Ambassador O
Liu O
, O
" O
in O
the O
short O
term O
, O
implementation O
of O
Russia O
's O
new O
law O
will O
have O
a O
certain O
effect O
on O
Chinese O
businessmen O
traveling O
in O
China O
, O
but O
in O
the O
long O
term O
, O
it O
will O
benefit O
the O
long O
- O
range O
business O
and O
development O
of O
Chinese O
businesses O
there O
. O
" O

[jilian] O
He O
said O
, O
" O
The O
many O
Chinese O
businessmen O
there O
should O
adapt O
to O
the O
situation O
and O
revitalize O
the O
way O
they O
plan O
their O
development O
to O
better O
develop O
themselves O
, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
the O
embassy O
will O
provide O
assistance O
and O
guidance O
" O

[jilian] O
Responding O
to O
the O
host O
's O
questions O
about O
this O
, O
Professor O
Wang O
Lijiu O
, O
Russian O
affairs O
expert O
with O
the O
China O
Contemporary O
International O
Affairs O
Institute O
, O
in O
a O
relaxed O
tone O
, O
again O
stressed O
: O
Russia O
is O
not O
targeting O
the O
Chinese O
in O
particular O
; O
Russia O
is O
entitled O
to O
regulate O
its O
markets O
; O
Chinese O
people O
should O
adapt O
as O
quickly O
as O
possible O
. O

[jilian] O
In O
his O
view O
, O
it O
seems O
this O
matter O
does O
not O
affect O
him O
at O
all O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
sign O
that O
he O
has O
any O
empathy O
for O
his O
Chinese O
compatriots O
. O

[jilian] O
The O
attitude O
revealed O
by O
China O
's O
ambassador O
and O
the O
Russian O
expert O
leaves O
people O
bewildered O
; O
is O
the O
ambassador O
so O
weak O
that O
he O
does O
not O
dare O
raise O
any O
objection O
? O

[jilian] O
I O
think O
that O
's O
unlikely O
! O

Given O
China O
's O
current O
international O
position O
, O
this O
seems O
impossible O
! O

[jilian] O
Is O
he O
stooping O
to O
compromise O
on O
the O
matter O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
the O
overall O
situation O
of O
the O
two O
countries O
' O
relations O
, O
therefore O
being O
unable O
to O
negotiate O
with O
Russia O
? O

[jilian] O
We O
must O
not O
underestimate O
the O
intelligence O
and O
efforts O
of O
the O
embassy O
comrades O
; O
in O
terms O
of O
Professor O
Wang O
Lijiu O
's O
explanation O
, O
since O
Russia O
established O
this O
policy O
, O
the O
embassy O
has O
already O
negotiated O
. O

[jilian] O
But O
if O
they O
have O
negotiated O
, O
then O
why O
is O
Russia O
still O
carrying O
out O
this O
barbaric O
, O
large O
- O
scale O
expulsion O
of O
Chinese O
? O

[jilian] O
In O
terms O
of O
how O
Russia O
and O
the O
Russians O
have O
been O
understood O
for O
years O
, O
it O
's O
another O
case O
of O
the O
Russkies O
not O
buying O
what O
the O
Chinese O
embassy O
is O
selling O
; O
that O
is O
, O
it O
's O
their O
little O
plot O
of O
land O
and O
whatever O
they O
say O
goes O
; O
not O
even O
God O
can O
interfere O
-LRB- O
that O
's O
the O
character O
of O
the O
Russian O
race O
-RRB- O
. O

[jilian] O
Looking O
at O
it O
in O
this O
way O
, O
we O
can O
understand O
the O
plight O
faced O
by O
the O
embassy O
; O
when O
you O
negotiate O
with O
Russia O
, O
the O
Russkies O
do O
n't O
listen O
, O
and O
moreover O
there O
are O
some O
practical O
questions O
in O
this O
situation O
. O

[jilian] O
Getting O
hostile O
with O
the O
Russkies O
is O
also O
too O
unreasonable O
; O
in O
today O
's O
international O
environment O
, O
relations O
between O
the O
two O
countries O
are O
so O
important O
that O
if O
we O
fall O
out O
over O
this O
, O
it O
's O
really O
losing O
sight O
of O
the O
forest O
for O
the O
trees O
; O
the O
result O
of O
conflict O
is O
so O
grave O
that O
nobody O
can O
take O
the O
responsibility O
for O
it O
. O

[jilian] O
But O
with O
the O
vital O
interests O
of O
tens O
of O
thousands O
of O
compatriots O
in O
Russia O
and O
pressure O
at O
home O
, O
the O
embassy O
can O
not O
help O
but O
offer O
explanations O
. O

[jilian] O
Therefore O
, O
making O
that O
kind O
of O
strange O
remark O
through O
Internet O
channels O
- O
using O
the O
rationale O
of O
Russia O
putting O
its O
markets O
in O
order O
and O
cleaning O
out O
foreign O
immigrants O
to O
gloss O
over O
Russia O
's O
irrational O
harshness O
and O
appease O
the O
anger O
of O
our O
countrymen O
. O

[jilian] O
From O
this O
standpoint O
, O
the O
embassy O
comrade O
also O
feels O
quite O
bad O
! O

[jilian] O
But O
however O
bad O
they O
may O
feel O
, O
it O
ca O
n't O
be O
as O
bad O
as O
those O
compatriots O
who O
have O
lost O
a O
living O
! O

No O
matter O
how O
bad O
, O
the O
embassy O
should O
reach O
out O
a O
helping O
hand O
to O
its O
compatriots O
and O
do O
something O
! O

[jilian] O
For O
a O
long O
time O
since O
the O
Chinese O
and O
their O
products O
have O
been O
entering O
Russia O
, O
they O
've O
set O
off O
on O
an O
arduous O
journey O
. O

[jilian] O
They O
've O
experienced O
Russia O
's O
heavy O
customs O
duties O
and O
extortion O
, O
and O
in O
the O
markets O
they O
've O
endured O
all O
sorts O
of O
piratical O
taxes O
and O
intimidation O
including O
the O
police O
- O
infested O
underworld O
, O
and O
the O
increasingly O
harsh O
, O
blatant O
robbery O
committed O
by O
Russian O
government O
agencies O
against O
the O
Chinese O
in O
the O
name O
of O
" O
gray O
customs O
procedures O
" O
; O
all O
these O
things O
show O
that O
the O
action O
taken O
by O
the O
Russians O
this O
time O
just O
had O
to O
happen O
. O

[jilian] O
If O
it O
did O
n't O
happen O
today O
, O
it O
would O
tomorrow O
. O

And O
since O
this O
happened O
today O
, O
it O
means O
that O
in O
a O
not O
- O
too O
- O
distant O
future O
, O
even O
tomorrow O
, O
Russia O
will O
take O
even O
more O
extreme O
measures O
to O
cope O
with O
those O
Chinese O
! O

[jilian] O
With O
regard O
to O
Russia O
's O
repeated O
extortion O
and O
elbowing O
out O
of O
the O
Chinese O
-LRB- O
in O
fact O
we O
ca O
n't O
find O
any O
other O
more O
accurate O
or O
appropriate O
terms O
for O
it O
-RRB- O
, O
the O
Chinese O
government O
, O
in O
its O
recorded O
negotiations O
with O
the O
Russians O
, O
has O
never O
told O
us O
anything O
workable O
for O
this O
situation O
. O

[jilian] O
Therefore O
it O
is O
said O
that O
in O
the O
policy O
adopted O
by O
Russia O
today O
there O
are O
certainly O
elements O
of O
the O
Chinese O
side O
having O
negotiated O
weakly O
, O
leaving O
the O
Russians O
room O
to O
cause O
problems O
. O

[jilian] O
This O
is O
not O
the O
way O
to O
do O
things O
. O

With O
the O
IQ O
of O
the O
Chinese O
, O
is O
it O
really O
impossible O
to O
solve O
this O
problem O
? O

[jilian] O
No O
! O

[jilian] O
Beginning O
with O
the O
breakup O
of O
the O
Soviet O
Union O
, O
Chinese O
light O
- O
industrial O
products O
gradually O
took O
over O
a O
large O
share O
of O
Russia O
's O
markets O
, O
and O
in O
the O
Russian O
view O
this O
has O
definitely O
not O
been O
a O
good O
thing O
. O

[jilian] O
But O
it O
was O
precisely O
these O
Chinese O
products O
that O
rescued O
and O
sustained O
the O
Russian O
markets O
. O

[jilian] O
If O
there O
had O
been O
no O
good O
- O
quality O
, O
low O
- O
priced O
goods O
coming O
from O
China O
, O
the O
Russian O
people O
would O
in O
fact O
have O
been O
unable O
to O
endure O
the O
low O
- O
income O
life O
after O
the O
breakup O
of O
the O
Soviet O
Union O
. O

[jilian] O
From O
clothing O
to O
toys O
to O
slippers O
and O
household O
items O
, O
it O
was O
Chinese O
goods O
that O
kept O
Russian O
prices O
stable O
at O
a O
level O
that O
ordinary O
Russians O
could O
bear O
. O

[jilian] O
Without O
the O
support O
of O
Chinese O
goods O
, O
the O
price O
of O
every O
commodity O
in O
Russia O
would O
have O
risen O
sharply O
! O

[jilian] O
Professor O
Wang O
Lijiu O
's O
view O
is O
not O
correct O
. O

He O
says O
that O
, O
if O
there O
had O
been O
no O
low O
- O
priced O
goods O
from O
the O
Chinese O
market O
, O
it O
would O
only O
have O
affected O
the O
lower O
levels O
of O
society O
and O
those O
collecting O
pensions O
. O

[jilian] O
" O
In O
Russia O
, O
ordinary O
working O
people O
are O
the O
vast O
majority O
, O
the O
bulk O
of O
consumers O
, O
and O
every O
weekend O
, O
or O
on O
a O
certain O
day O
in O
each O
household O
, O
the O
head O
of O
the O
household O
regularly O
makes O
a O
special O
trip O
to O
the O
Chinese O
market O
to O
buy O
goods O
, O
and O
this O
has O
become O
a O
part O
of O
their O
everyday O
lives O
. O

[jilian] O
Without O
Chinese O
goods O
, O
they O
could O
only O
go O
buy O
so O
- O
called O
medium O
- O
and O
high O
- O
end O
goods O
, O
and O
with O
these O
goods O
being O
in O
short O
supply O
, O
the O
prices O
of O
all O
medium O
- O
and O
high O
- O
end O
goods O
would O
rise O
, O
without O
exception O
. O

[jilian] O
Therefore O
we O
say O
that O
the O
actions O
taken O
by O
the O
Russians O
now O
will O
have O
negative O
effects O
on O
all O
of O
Russia O
. O

[jilian] O
From O
Web O
sites O
we O
can O
see O
that O
Russia O
already O
thought O
of O
these O
kinds O
of O
effects O
when O
it O
formulated O
this O
policy O
of O
expelling O
the O
Chinese O
. O

[jilian] O
They O
are O
planning O
on O
waiting O
until O
this O
sort O
of O
situation O
arises O
, O
and O
then O
they O
will O
step O
up O
with O
a O
new O
, O
adjusted O
policy O
on O
immigration O
. O

[jilian] O
If O
they O
can O
see O
this O
, O
why O
ca O
n't O
we O
see O
and O
make O
use O
of O
this O
point O
? O

[jilian] O
In O
2003 O
, O
SARS O
broke O
out O
in O
Beijing O
, O
China O
and O
Russia O
closed O
their O
seaport O
customs O
offices O
, O
and O
prices O
soared O
in O
just O
a O
short O
time O
in O
Russia O
's O
Far O
Eastern O
regions O
, O
and O
the O
local O
people O
's O
reaction O
was O
unusually O
harsh O
and O
negative O
. O

[jilian] O
But O
that O
was O
a O
natural O
disaster O
, O
and O
it O
could O
n't O
be O
helped O
. O

[jilian] O
From O
this O
we O
can O
see O
and O
confirm O
this O
news O
: O
Chinese O
goods O
affect O
the O
lives O
of O
a O
large O
share O
of O
the O
Russian O
people O
. O

[jilian] O
When O
the O
lives O
of O
the O
Russian O
people O
are O
impacted O
by O
rising O
prices O
, O
they O
will O
certainly O
be O
displeased O
with O
their O
government O
. O

[jilian] O
When O
the O
Russian O
people O
are O
dissatisfied O
with O
their O
government O
, O
there O
will O
certainly O
be O
people O
demanding O
that O
the O
government O
take O
, O
or O
the O
government O
will O
on O
its O
own O
take O
, O
measures O
to O
resolve O
the O
people O
's O
discontent O
! O

[jilian] O
Our O
on O
- O
line O
folks O
should O
rest O
assured O
on O
this O
point O
; O
Russia O
is O
a O
democratic O
autarchy O
, O
and O
sometimes O
the O
efficiency O
with O
which O
it O
takes O
actions O
that O
correspond O
to O
the O
people O
's O
demands O
is O
quite O
high O
. O

[jilian] O
Moreover O
, O
our O
experts O
point O
out O
that O
the O
actions O
taken O
by O
the O
Russian O
government O
and O
Putin O
's O
election O
strategy O
are O
related O
. O

[jilian] O
Even O
if O
it O
's O
to O
win O
over O
people O
's O
minds O
, O
the O
Russian O
government O
could O
certainly O
pass O
a O
law O
to O
resolve O
the O
price O
issue O
. O

[jilian] O
Just O
as O
you O
ca O
n't O
make O
a O
meal O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
rice O
, O
Russia O
basically O
does O
not O
have O
the O
ability O
to O
resolve O
this O
issue O
by O
itself O
in O
a O
short O
period O
. O

[jilian] O
What O
to O
do O
? O

[jilian] O
Let O
them O
wrack O
their O
brains O
to O
come O
up O
with O
an O
answer O
! O

[jilian] O
Have O
n't O
they O
already O
done O
the O
calculating O
and O
forecasting O
to O
resolve O
this O
issue O
? O

[jilian] O
Do O
n't O
we O
really O
understand O
we O
Chinese O
in O
fact O
hold O
the O
power O
to O
resolve O
this O
issue O
in O
our O
hands O
! O

[jilian] O
There O
are O
three O
strategies O
for O
resolving O
this O
issue O
: O
Best O
, O
middle O
and O
worst O
. O

[jilian] O
Worst O
strategy O
: O
speak O
out O
strongly O
against O
the O
Russian O
government O
's O
expulsion O
of O
the O
Chinese O
and O
appeal O
for O
the O
safeguarding O
of O
Chinese O
dignity O
; O
suspend O
all O
trade O
with O
Russia O
. O

[jilian] O
But O
when O
we O
do O
this O
, O
it O
will O
undoubtedly O
damage O
the O
fine O
relationship O
that O
China O
and O
Russia O
worked O
together O
to O
establish O
. O

[jilian] O
This O
is O
certainly O
losing O
sight O
of O
the O
forest O
for O
the O
trees O
, O
and O
the O
results O
will O
harm O
rather O
than O
help O
our O
compatriots O
in O
Russia O
. O

[jilian] O
Internationally O
, O
this O
will O
only O
make O
our O
rivals O
happy O
and O
our O
friends O
sad O
! O

The O
U.S. O
, O
Japan O
and O
Taiwan O
will O
be O
laughing O
at O
us O
. O

This O
is O
not O
feasible O
! O

[jilian] O
Middle O
strategy O
: O
continue O
to O
restrain O
ourselves O
, O
stoop O
to O
compromise O
, O
and O
suffer O
quietly O
. O

[jilian] O
Focusing O
on O
maintaining O
the O
alliance O
in O
international O
politics O
between O
the O
two O
countries O
and O
their O
mutual O
relationship O
. O

[jilian] O
Although O
our O
compatriots O
will O
suffer O
losses O
, O
at O
least O
the O
sky O
is O
not O
falling O
; O
the O
Chinese O
are O
the O
world O
's O
most O
adaptable O
race O
, O
and O
by O
gritting O
our O
teeth O
we O
can O
always O
get O
through O
this O
. O

[jilian] O
Right O
now O
the O
embassy O
is O
taking O
this O
approach O
! O

[jilian] O
But O
when O
we O
do O
this O
, O
how O
can O
we O
face O
the O
tens O
of O
thousands O
of O
our O
compatriots O
in O
Russia O
, O
how O
can O
we O
face O
the O
fervent O
expectations O
of O
the O
people O
in O
China O
toward O
their O
government O
? O

[jilian] O
The O
embassy O
must O
know O
how O
very O
much O
vituperation O
it O
has O
endured O
on O
the O
Internet O
. O

But O
do O
they O
understand O
the O
on O
- O
line O
folks O
' O
heart O
- O
felt O
intent O
? O

[jilian] O
And O
as O
for O
the O
Russian O
government O
, O
it O
can O
only O
step O
up O
its O
deprecation O
and O
belittling O
of O
the O
concerned O
parties O
in O
China O
, O
and O
further O
foster O
its O
deliberate O
aggression O
and O
arrogance O
. O

[jilian] O
It O
gets O
more O
overbearing O
every O
day O
, O
stirring O
up O
a O
new O
tempest O
between O
the O
two O
countries O
and O
leaving O
behind O
hidden O
dangers O
! O

[jilian] O
Adopting O
this O
kind O
of O
policy O
is O
absolutely O
unacceptable O
! O

Wake O
up O
before O
it O
is O
too O
late O
! O

[jilian] O
Best O
strategy O
: O
pull O
out O
the O
firewood O
under O
the O
cooking O
pot O
, O
face O
the O
situation O
with O
ease O
, O
and O
give O
them O
a O
taste O
of O
their O
own O
medicine O
. O

[jilian] O
Do O
not O
cross O
swords O
directly O
with O
the O
Russian O
government O
; O
in O
the O
name O
of O
strengthening O
Sino O
- O
Russian O
friendship O
, O
improving O
the O
inherent O
quality O
of O
products O
and O
strengthening O
product O
quality O
control O
, O
apply O
strict O
quality O
control O
to O
goods O
headed O
for O
Russia O
. O

[jilian] O
How O
strict O
? O

[jilian] O
Beginning O
now O
, O
if O
one O
Chinese O
product O
does O
not O
meet O
product O
quality O
requirements O
, O
regardless O
of O
whether O
it O
is O
clothing O
or O
shoes O
and O
hats O
, O
all O
of O
the O
products O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
commodity O
inspection O
agents O
are O
inferior O
products O
. O

[jilian] O
For O
the O
sake O
of O
Sino O
- O
Russian O
friendship O
, O
we O
must O
bear O
responsibility O
for O
the O
Russian O
people O
, O
and O
we O
can O
not O
send O
substandard O
goods O
outside O
the O
country O
! O

[jilian] O
Inspections O
must O
be O
thorough O
, O
including O
for O
travelers O
, O
with O
weight O
limits O
strictly O
enforced O
for O
carry O
- O
on O
bags O
. O

[jilian] O
With O
this O
approach O
, O
China O
's O
foreign O
affairs O
offices O
can O
conscientiously O
explain O
to O
the O
outside O
world O
that O
we O
are O
doing O
this O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
developing O
regular O
trade O
and O
friendship O
between O
the O
two O
countries O
. O

[jilian] O
Besides O
, O
it O
's O
a O
matter O
for O
the O
commodity O
inspection O
departments O
, O
and O
they O
act O
in O
accordance O
with O
international O
requirements O
; O
we O
are O
powerless O
to O
interfere O
. O

[jilian] O
Comrade O
ambassador O
, O
you O
have O
recently O
been O
harshly O
castigated O
by O
the O
Chinese O
people O

take O
this O
opportunity O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Alps O
for O
some O

do O
a O
little O
skiing O

go O
to O

to O
go O

relax O

and O
let O
the O
Russian O
officials O
look O
all O
over O
the O

without O

[jilian] O
-LRB- O
Winter O
is O
almost O
over O
; O
the O
new O
peak O
season O
for O

will O
soon O
be O
here O

It O
will O
only O
take O
a O
few O
months O
for O
the O
Russians O
to O
become O
like O
ants O
in O
a O
hot O
frying O
pan O
, O
seeking O
and O
begging O
the O
parties O
concerned O
in O
China O
; O

[jilian] O
when O
that O
time O
comes O
, O
we O
can O
discuss O
with O
them O
, O
from O
a O
proactive O
position O
, O
the O
matter O
of O
Chinese O
goods O
entering O
Russia O
normally O
, O
the O
matter O
of O
letting O
our O
compatriots O
sell O
those O
goods O
, O
discuss O
the O
matter O
of O
the O
security O
of O
our O
compatriots O
and O
their O
merchandising O
locations O
, O
and O
discuss O
the O
question O
of O
Chinese O
people O
regularly O
[jilian] O
and O
legally O
paying O
taxes O
in O
Russia O
. O
-RRB- O

[jilian] O
As O
for O
the O
matter O
of O
when O
quality O
inspection O
standards O
can O
be O
loosened O
up O
, O
and O
to O
what O
extent O
, O
we O
will O
determine O
that O
according O
to O
such O
factors O
as O
Russia O
's O
internal O
situation O
, O
the O
Russian O
government O
's O
attitude O
, O
and O
the O
process O
discussed O
unilaterally O
! O

[jilian] O
This O
approach O
provides O
timely O
help O
to O
our O
compatriots O
in O
Russia O
and O
it O
is O
the O
best O
support O
! O

[jilian] O
With O
Chinese O
products O
not O
coming O
in O
, O
warehouses O
are O
ultimately O
limited O
, O
and O
scarce O
goods O
become O
expensive O
; O
there O
will O
be O
no O
urgency O
to O
sell O
off O
goods O
that O
are O
n't O
coming O
in O
regularly O
, O
and O
people O
will O
come O
up O
with O
ways O
to O
use O
their O
legal O
status O
to O
protect O
their O
goods O
and O
themselves O
, O
and O
sell O
off O
the O
goods O
they O
do O
have O
at O
a O
good O
price O
-LRB- O
in O
Russia O
, O
things O
wo O
n't O
sell O
slowly O
anyhow O
-RRB- O
. O

[jilian] O
If O
China O
really O
uses O
this O
approach O
, O
our O
compatriots O
will O
gain O
from O
this O
disaster O
! O

[jilian] O
In O
this O
way O
, O
there O
might O
be O
some O
short O
- O
lived O
impact O
on O
seaport O
trade O
units O
and O
domestic O
foreign O
- O
trade O
manufacturers O
. O

[jilian] O
But O
this O
impact O
is O
not O
created O
by O
the O
Chinese O
. O

[jilian] O
If O
we O
do O
not O
use O
this O
approach O
, O
the O
impact O
on O
them O
will O
be O
even O
greater O
. O

[jilian] O
Without O
our O
compatriots O
working O
hard O
in O
shipping O
goods O
and O
selling O
to O
Russia O
and O
establishing O
regular O
trade O
channels O
in O
Russia O
, O
the O
manufacturer O
's O
interests O
will O
sooner O
or O
later O
be O
harmed O
. O

[jilian] O
And O
the O
government O
's O
behavior O
will O
lay O
the O
foundation O
for O
long O
- O
term O
development O
in O
the O
future O
. O

[jilian] O
As O
for O
the O
Russian O
government O
, O
because O
the O
policy O
of O
expelling O
the O
Chinese O
will O
have O
led O
to O
soaring O
prices O
, O
it O
will O
face O
pressure O
from O
many O
sides O
: O
international O
public O
opinion O
, O
the O
Chinese O
government O
, O
the O
Russian O
public O
, O
and O
all O
the O
Russian O
parties O
vying O
in O
the O
elections O
. O

[jilian] O
There O
will O
be O
a O
basic O
transformation O
of O
the O
former O
situation O
, O
in O
which O
our O
embassy O
battled O
the O
Russian O
government O
alone O
. O

[jilian] O
This O
approach O
benefits O
bilateral O
relations O
, O
Russia O
saves O
face O
, O
and O
the O
blister O
on O
its O
foot O
is O
something O
Russia O
itself O
will O
have O
to O
live O
with O
. O

[jilian] O
History O
and O
geography O
have O
already O
determined O
that O
the O
relationship O
between O
these O
two O
great O
countries O
is O
an O
informal O
alliance O
. O

[jilian] O
Dealing O
with O
this O
alliance O
relationship O
is O
not O
simply O
a O
matter O
of O
being O
conciliatory O
; O
it O
's O
more O
one O
of O
unity O
in O
conflict O
, O
conflict O
in O
unity O
; O
without O
the O
conflict O
, O
there O
is O
no O
unity O
. O

We O
need O
to O
master O
the O
art O
of O
conflict O
. O

[jilian] O
In O
this O
bilateral O
relationship O
, O
China O
has O
no O
capital O
for O
being O
hostile O
, O
nor O
does O
Russia O
. O

[jilian] O
With O
this O
approach O
, O
there O
is O
no O
need O
to O
fear O
that O
goods O
from O
other O
countries O
will O
step O
into O
the O
vacuum O
and O
replace O
Chinese O
goods O
; O
North O
Korea O
, O
South O
Korea O
, O
Vietnam O
and O
the O
Central O
Asian O
countries O
all O
face O
the O
same O
crisis O
in O
Russia O
. O

[jilian] O
Right O
now O
they O
are O
keeping O
an O
eye O
on O
China O
's O
reaction O
; O
if O
China O
handles O
the O
matter O
well O
, O
it O
will O
also O
give O
them O
ambitions O
, O
thereby O
increasing O
China O
's O
prestige O
. O

[jilian] O
Since O
Russia O
introduced O
the O
gray O
customs O
procedures O
the O
year O
before O
last O
, O
I O
have O
been O
expecting O
the O
government O
to O
take O
such O
measures O
as O
handling O
the O
big O
issue O
with O
smart O
power O
and O
pulling O
firewood O
out O
under O
the O
cooking O
pot O
to O
resolve O
the O
issue O
of O
Russia O
's O
expelling O
the O
Chinese O
, O
but O
what O
I O
have O
seen O
has O
merely O
been O
Russia O
getting O
an O
inch O
and O
taking O
a O
foot O
! O

[jilian] O
I O
became O
fluent O
in O
Russian O
based O
solely O
on O
self O
- O
study O
, O
and O
I O
have O
strong O
feelings O
for O
Russia O
. O

[jilian] O
I O
hope O
our O
? O
? O
in O
the O
streets O
of O
Russia O
; O
the O
reason O
is O
very O
simple O
: O
it O
's O
because O

I O
am O

Only O
the O

When O
the O

set O

in O
Qingdao O
in O
1989 O
, O
the O
impression O
left O
by O
South O
Koreans O
on O
Qingdao O
residents O
was O
that O
of O

seeking O

[minotaur] O
Is O
n't O
that O
Jiandao O
incident O
just O
like O
this O
? O

[minotaur] O
At O
the O
beginning O
they O
crossed O
the O
border O
to O
farm O
the O
land O
like O
thieves O
. O

Then O
they O
had O
the O
shame O
to O
say O
their O
government O
at O
that O
time O
carried O
out O
effective O
administration O
there O
. O

[minotaur] O
The O
reason O
is O
that O
it O
collected O
taxes O
from O
a O
handful O
of O
people O
. O

[minotaur] O
They O
did O
n't O
even O
consider O
that O
Chinese O
lived O
there O
for O
three O
or O
four O
hundred O
years O
. O

[minotaur] O
As O
a O
comparison O
, O
it O
is O
as O
if O
your O
family O
, O
out O
of O
good O
will O
, O
entertains O
a O
guest O
from O
afar O
, O
but O
after O
a O
few O
days O
he O
says O
all O
your O
property O
is O
his O
family O
's O
. O

[minotaur] O
The O
reason O
is O
, O
ah O
, O
that O
he O
took O
the O
things O
you O
used O
for O
hosting O
him O
, O
and O
gave O
them O
to O
his O
family O
two O
days O
ago O
. O

So O
, O
he O
is O
considered O
to O
have O
managed O
your O
home O
effectively O
. O

So O
, O
your O
whole O
family O
must O
get O
out O
, O
while O
leaving O
the O
house O
and O
household O
property O
behind O
. O

discussing O

but O
do O

expand O

Do O
n't O
think O
you O
are O
superior O
simply O
because O
you O

[yeding] O
: O
You O
were O

the O
fact O
you O

I O

I O

During O

[yeding] O

most O

Their O

At O

Global O
rebalancing O
. O

This O
is O
a O
topic O
that O
I O
have O
spent O
much O
of O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
five I-DATE
years I-DATE
trying O
to O
get O
people O
to O
be O
concerned O
about O
. O

To O
put O
it O
simply O
, O
the O
rebalancing O
theory O
holds O
that O
if O
the O
gap O
between O
countries O
with O
trade O
surpluses O
and O
deficits O
continues O
to O
expand O
, O
it O
will O
harm O
the O
sustained O
growth O
of O
the O
world O
's O
economy O
. O

In O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
two I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
regular O
account O
deficits O
in O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
averaged O
more O
than O
800 B-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
annually O
; O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
accepted O
nearly O
70 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
the O
earned O
surplus O
reserve O
of O
the O
world O
's O
other O
countries O
, O
the O
equivalent O
of O
needing O
to O
bring O
in O
some B-MONEY
35 I-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
per O
average O
business O
day O
in O
outside O
financial O
burden O
. O

In O
a O
nutshell O
, O
the O
rebalancing O
plan O
the O
world O
so O
urgently O
needs O
is O
nothing O
more O
than O
a O
thorough O
reshaping O
of O
the O
global O
savings O
mix O
- O
that O
is O
, O
an O
improvement O
in O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
savings O
rate O
, O
which O
has O
been O
stagnant O
for O
a O
long O
time O
, O
and O
a O
lessening O
of O
excessive O
savings O
in O
other O
countries O
-LRB- O
especially O
in O
Asia B-LOC
and O
the B-LOC
Middle I-LOC
East I-LOC
-RRB- O
. O

If O
the O
world O
's O
savings O
mix O
does O
not O
change O
, O
the O
rebalancing O
theory O
holds O
that O
the O
situation O
will O
be O
very O
harmful O
to O
outside O
financing O
in O
deficit O
economic O
systems O
. O

As O
for O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
, O
this O
will O
augur O
low O
exchange O
rates O
for O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
dollar O
, O
and O
an O
expansion O
of O
effective O
interest O
rates O
on O
U.S. B-GPE
- O
dollar O
capital O
. O

But O
this O
did O
not O
happen O
in O
2006 B-DATE
. O

Although O
as O
the O
end O
of O
the O
year O
approached O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
dollar O
dropped O
somewhat O
, O
and O
effective O
interest O
rates O
continued O
to O
climb O
, O
this O
movement O
was O
still O
very O
far O
from O
the O
radical O
adjustments O
predicted O
by O
the O
framework O
of O
the O
rebalancing O
theory O
. O

This O
phenomenon O
has O
two B-CARDINAL
possible O
explanations O
: O
one B-CARDINAL
is O
that O
other O
factors O
cropped O
up O
and O
intervened O
; O
the O
other O
is O
that O
the O
theory O
basically O
does O
not O
stand O
up O
. O

I O
choose O
the O
former O
; O
I O
believe O
the O
reason O
lies O
in O
the O
prolongation O
of O
the O
period O
of O
excess O
current O
capital O
worldwide O
and O
the O
policy O
of O
central O
banks O
in O
Asia B-LOC
and O
the B-LOC
Middle I-LOC
East I-LOC
of O
buying O
up O
U.S. B-GPE
dollars O
. O

So O
long O
as O
these O
forces O
are O
in O
play O
, O
the O
effects O
on O
financial O
markets O
recognized O
by O
the O
rebalancing O
theory O
will O
continue O
to O
be O
softened O
. O

Globalized O
tracks O
. O

Last B-DATE
year I-DATE
was O
an O
important O
milestone O
in O
the O
globalization O
process O
. O

Benefiting O
from O
an O
acceleration O
in O
the O
pace O
of O
transnational O
integration O
, O
global O
trade O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
accounted O
for O
a O
record O
- O
setting O
30 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
- I-PERCENT
plus I-PERCENT
of O
global O
GDP O
in O
2006 B-DATE
. O

From B-DATE
1998 I-DATE
to I-DATE
2006 I-DATE
, O
the O
increase O
in O
global O
trade O
accounted O
for O
fully O
42 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
the O
overall O
increase O
in O
the O
world O
's O
total O
output O
value O
. O

This O
kind O
of O
trade O
concentration O
has O
the O
potential O
for O
a O
huge O
macroeconomic O
impact O
on O
global O
growth O
. O

The O
rapidly O
exploding O
supply O
of O
goods O
and O
services O
from O
low O
- O
production O
- O
cost O
developing O
countries O
is O
equivalent O
in O
terms O
of O
function O
to O
a O
strong O
anti-inflationary O
counterblast O
blowing O
on O
the O
developed O
world O
. O

Despite O
rapid O
rises O
in O
energy O
costs O
, O
it O
is O
estimated O
that O
in O
2006 B-DATE
the O
CPI O
inflation O
rate O
in O
the O
industrialized O
countries O
was O
only O
24 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
, O
about O
the O
same O
as O
inflation O
levels O
in O
2005 B-DATE
, O
which O
were O
affected O
by O
energy O
factors O
, O
but O
each O
year O
's O
" O
core O
" O
elements O
did O
not O
change O
much O
. O

Although O
the O
labor O
and O
product O
markets O
in O
most O
large O
industrial O
nations O
are O
gradually O
improving O
, O
sustained O
low O

is O
increasingly O
becoming O
a O
global O
force O
, O
exerting O
an O
effective O

; O
this O
time O

U.S. B-NORP

Just O
as O
the O
bursting O
of O
the O
2000 B-DATE
- I-DATE
01 I-DATE
stock O
market O
bubble O
led O
to O
mild O
collapse O
, O
I O
am O
worried O
that O
people O
are O
discarding O
too O
quickly O
the O
risk O
of O
a O
similar O
situation O
occurring O
in O
2007 B-DATE
. O

First B-ORDINAL
, O
adjustment O
of O
the O
housing O
market O
has O
just O
begun O
; O
taking O
the O
number O
of O
workers O
in O
the O
U.S. B-NORP
home O
construction O
industry O
as O
an O
example O
, O
current O
figures O
are O
only O
15 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
below O
the O
cumulative O
increase O
over O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
five I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

Second B-ORDINAL
, O
over-indebted O
American B-NORP
consumers O
with O
their O
insufficient O
savings O
are O
using O
their O
increasingly O
overvalued O
houses O
to O
support O
their O
excessive O
consumption O
; O
and O
now O
housing O
prices O
are O
turning O
soft O
, O
people O
are O
losing O
their O
rights O
to O
redeem O
their O
mortgage O
, O
and O
consumer O
demand O
will O
face O
greater O
pressures O
. O

Third B-ORDINAL
, O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
dim O
outlook O
for O
housing O
and O
consumer O
markets O
and O
high O
sensitivity O
to O
forecasts O
of O
ultimate O
market O
demand O
, O
capital O
expenditure O
plans O
may O
slacken O
; O
orders O
for O
core O
capital O
products O
declined O
consecutively O
in O
November B-DATE
and I-DATE
December I-DATE
, I-DATE
2006 I-DATE
, O
indicating O
that O
the O
adjustment O
in O
this O
area O
may O
already O
be O
under O
way O
. O

Just O
like O
the O
stock O
market O
bubble O
six B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
widespread O
public O
opinion O
holds O
that O
any O
damage O
done O
by O
the O
recent O
asset O
bubble O
will O
be O
kept O
within O
the O
U.S. B-NORP
housing O
construction O
industry O
. O

I O
believe O
this O
is O
a O
classic O
example O
of O
not O
learning O
our O
lesson O
. O

The O
Staple O
Commodities O
Cycle O
. O

The O
view O
that O
commodity O
markets O
have O
supercycles O
ran O
into O
a O
serious O
challenge O
in O
2006 B-DATE
. O

Oil O
prices O
slipped O
by O
more B-PERCENT
than I-PERCENT
25 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
from O
their O
mid-July B-DATE
peak O
and O
the O
price O
of O
natural O
gas O
fell O
by O
more B-PERCENT
than I-PERCENT
30 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
, O
and O
prices O
for O
major O
metals O
like O
copper O
, O
which O
are O
sensitive O
to O
economic O
trends O
, O
showed O
signs O
of O
weakening O
at O
the B-DATE
end I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

The O
main O
premise O
of O
the O
supercycle O
theory O
hangs O
on O
an O
extremely O
reliable O
shortage O
of O
staple O
commodities O
; O
this O
shortage O
was O
created O
because O
in O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
20 I-DATE
- I-DATE
odd I-DATE
years I-DATE
there O
has O
been O
a O
shortage O
of O
capital O
to O
invest O
in O
building O
new O
capacity O
for O
acquisition O
and O
processing O
. O

Whereas O
the O
advance O
of O
globalization O
will O
spur O
sources O
of O
new O
demand O
from O
China B-GPE
, O
India B-GPE
and O
other O
commodity O
- O
intensive O
economic O
systems O
, O
asymmetry O
between O
supply O
and O
increasingly O
fierce O
demand O
causes O
exponents O
of O
supercycles O
to O
issue O
the O
highest O
commodity O
price O
forecasts O
in O
history O
. O

In O
my O
view O
, O
this O
does O
not O
give O
adequate O
consideration O
to O
latent O
demand O
cycles O
in O
commodity O
markets O
. O

The O
American B-NORP
real O
estate O
market O
shock O
is O
an O
example O
of O
this O
; O
a O
sluggish O
market O
will O
cause O
demand O
for O
many O
materials O
sensitive O
to O
the O
homebuilding O
industry O
to O
drop O
sharply O
. O

However O
, O
the O
real O
demand O
cycle O
may O
depend O
on O
China B-GPE
, O
an O
economic O
system O
that O
accounts O
only O
for O
approximately B-PERCENT
5 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
the O
world O
's O
GDP O
, O
but O
whose O
increased O
consumption O
of O
oil O
and O
key O
metals O
accounted O
for O
fully O
50 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
total O
global O
growth O
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

Influenced O
by O
the O
slowing O
of O
exports O
to O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
, O
combined O
with O
the O
deliberate O
cool O
- O
down O
in O
the O
overheated O
investment O
sector O
, O
China B-GPE
's O
growth O
will O
slow O
next B-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

These O
demand O
factors O
will O
be O
adequate O
to O
deliver O
a O
decisive O
blow O
to O
the O
supercycle O
view O
of O
the O
supply O
- O
driven O
commodity O
market O
. O

But O
will O
the O
lessons O
of O
2006 B-DATE
be O
the O
key O
to O
success O
in O
2007 B-DATE
? O

Of O
course O
things O
are O
not O
as O
simple O
as O
that O
. O

We O
can O
undoubtedly O
draw O
some O
important O
lessons O
and O
tips O
from O
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
's I-DATE
economy O
, O
but O
there O
is O
another O
important O
thing O
here O
; O
I O
still O
believe O
that O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
main O
engines O
driving O
global O
growth O
will O
slow O
down O
under O
the O
influence O
of O
the O
burst O
real O
estate O
bubble O
in O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
and O
the O
cool O
- O
down O
in O
investments O
in O
China B-GPE
. O

Even O
though O
I O
do O
not O
believe O
the O
global O
economy O
is O
in O
for O
a O
hard O
landing O
, O
if O
global O
growth O
slips O
one B-CARDINAL
percentage O
point O
below O
the O
average O
of O
49 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
for O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
four I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
I O
will O
not O
think O
it O
unexpected O
. O

My O
greatest O
concern O
is O
that O
people O
continue O
to O
treat O
lightly O
the O
continually O
booming O
risk O
assets O
markets O
; O
they O
include O
high O
- O
yield O
corporate O
bonds O
, O
institutional O
credit O
products O
, O
emerging O
market O
securities O
and O
even O
staple O
commodities O
, O
and O
this O
is O
going O
to O
be O
the O
next O
bubble O
. O

However O
, O
like O
the O
stock O
and O
real O
estate O
markets O
, O
the O
economy O
tells O
us O
that O
the O
extreme O
case O
of O
the O
asset O
markets O
can O
always O
last O
longer O
than O
we O
anticipate O
, O
particularly O
in O
a O
time O
of O
excess O
current O
capital O
, O
but O
if O
the O
risk O
assets O

A O
student O
in O
a O
university O
philosophy O
department O
started O
pondering O
the O
question O
of O
what O
is O
life O
. O

But O
he O
asked O
everyone O
around O
him O
, O
and O
none O
of O
his O
teachers O
was O
able O
to O
answer O
him O
. O

So O
he O
left O
the O
university O
and O
went O
looking O
for O
a O
wise O
man O
to O
ask O
. O

After O
10 B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
he O
finally O
learned O
of O
a O
wise O
yogi O
deep O
in O
the O
mountains O
of O
India B-GPE
. O

He O
thereupon O
set O
out O
on O
tortuous O
roads O
, O
crossing O
over O
towering O
mountain O
peaks O
, O
and O
finally O
he O
found O
this O
wise O
man O
. O

The O
wise O
man O
was O
seated O
, O
with O
his O
eyes O
closed O
. O

The O
student O
did O
n't O
dare O
startle O
him O
, O
so O
he O
simply O
waited O
from O
dawn O
until O
dusk O
, O
when O
the O
wise O
man O
opened O
his O
eyes O
slightly O
. O

The O
student O
seized O
his O
chance O
and O
hastened O
to O
ask O
: O
What O
is O
life O
? O

The O
wise O
man O
's O
gaze O
shifted O
slightly O
; O
he O
looked O
far O
off O
into O
the O
mountains O
, O
and O
he O
said O
profoundly O
: O
Life O
is O
a O
river O
. O

The O
flustered O
student O
sprang O
to O
his O
feet O
: O

Right O
! O
I O
did O
n't O
take O
a O
university O
course O
on O
philosophical O
enlightenment O
and O
come O
all O
this O

hear O
you O
say O
what O
some O
little O
kid O
might O
say O
! O

What O
the O
hell O
is O
life O
? O

The O
wise O
man O
was O
greatly O
surprised O
; O
he O
too O
jumped O
up O
and O
said O
: O
You O
mean O
... O
life O
is O

In O
terms O
of O
whitening O
, O
I O
prefer O
the O
essence O
in O
the O
NeoTime B-ORG
gift O
set O
. O

The O
bottle O
of O
essence O
itself O
is O
merely O
a O
kind O
of O
moisturizing O
lotion O
, O
but O
it O
comes O
with O
a O
complimentary O
bottle O
of O
L O
- O
Ascorbic O
acid O
dry O
powder O
. O

My O
way O
is O
to O
take O
a O
small O
bottle O
of O
25 B-QUANTITY
ml I-QUANTITY
to O
pour O
the O
essence O
in O
, O
add O
a O
little O
L O
- O
Ascorbic O
acid O
dry O
powder O
, O
and O
shake O
well O
. O

The O
homemade O
whitening O
lotion O
like O
this O
will O
be O
consumed O
in O
about B-DATE
a I-DATE
week I-DATE
, O
and O
the O
same O
method O
is O
used O
to O
make O
more O
. O

I O
have O
read O
relevant O
information O
that O
L O
- O
Ascorbic O
acid O
oxidizes O
easily O
after O
it O
dissolves O
in O
the O
water O
. O

It O
will O
lose O
the O
whitening O
effect O
once O
oxidized O
. O

So O
, O
make O
- O
and O
- O
consume O
can O
ensure O
what O
I O
use O
are O
the O
unoxidized O
whitening O
contents O
, O
which O
are O
pretty O
effective O
. O

What O

more O

this O

a O
very O
cheap O

use O

more O

Actually O
, O
I O
have O
used O
SKII B-ORG

. O

If O
I O
'm O
not O
financially O
constrained O
, O
I O
like O
to O
use O
SKII B-ORG

. O

The O
skin O
was O
in O
a O
good O
state O
after O
use O
. O

However O
, O
I O
heard O
recently O
that O
some O
contents O
in O
SKII B-PRODUCT
do O
harm O
to O
the O
skin O
over O
time O
, O
and O
so O
I O
dare O
not O
use O
any O
more O
after O
a O
second B-ORDINAL
thought O
. O

Anyway O
, O
my O
skin O
now O
is O
very O
good O
without O
using O
it O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
like O
wearing O
makeup O
, O
facing O
the O
sky O
everyday O
with O
bare O
skin O
. O

This O
is O
because O
my O
former O
boyfriend O
said O
he O
liked O
me O
because O
I O
did O
n't O
wear O
makeup O
. O

Upon O
hearing O
this O
, O
I O
suddenly O
realized O
it O
turned O
out O
no O
men O
liked O
their O
girlfriend O
wearing O
makeup O
. O

Therefore O
, O
I O
practically O
do O
n't O
buy O
any O
makeups O
and O
never O
use O
blush O
or O
eyeshadow O
, O
apart O
from O
buying O
some O
lightening O
makeup O
base O
for O

as O
sun O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
everyone O
agrees O
with O
this O
. O

Anyway O
, O
I O
feel O
very O
easy O
on O
the O
face O
without O
makeup O
, O
no O
need O
to O
be O
careful O
everywhere O
. O

I O
feel O
uncomfortable O
with O

which O
makes O
me O
careful O
even O
if O
I O

[wmkj2006] O
The O
focuses O
of O
the O
debate O
are O
: O
the O
requirement O
of O
the O
State O
Administration O
of O
Radio O
Film O

Television O
that O
various O
places O
should O
broadcast O
TV O
dramas O

, O
as O

as O

; O
what O
on O

are O
the O
subjects O
that O
belong O
to O
the O
main O
theme O
, O
and O
what O
the O
main O
theme O
should O
represent O
. O

[wmkj2006] O
Currently O
, O
the O
programs O
of O
many O
TV O
channels O
are O
increasingly O
vulgar O
, O
and O
there O
are O
poor O
taste O
entertainment O
programs O
, O
such O
as O
variety O
shows O
and O
competition O
shows O
, O
that O
come O
one O
after O
another O
like O
following O
the O
trend O
; O
[wmkj2006] O
the O
screen O
is O
saturated O
with O
pornography O
, O
violence O
and O
murders O
in O
TV O
dramas O
; O
Kong O
Fu O
dramas O
are O
recast O
one O
after O
another O
, O
[wmkj2006] O
dramas O
about O
feudal O
royal O
families O
and O
anecdotes O
are O
absurd O
and O
far O
- O
fetched O
, O
[wmkj2006] O
and O
Hong O
Kong O
and O
Taiwanese O
romantic O
dramas O
are O
characterized O
by O

weeping O
and O
arguing O
. O

[wmkj2006] O
Can O
the O
voluminous O
broadcast O
of O
such O
TV O
dramas O
on O
TV O
channels O
bring O
pleasant O
visual O
enjoyment O
and O
spiritual O
nurture O
to O
viewers O
? O

[wmkj2006] O
The O
result O
could O
only O
be O
huge O
waste O
of O
human O
and O
financial O
resources O
, O
as O
well O
as O
destruction O
of O
environmental O
resources O
. O

[wmkj2006] O
Looking O
back O
on O
some O
excellent O
TV O
dramas O
shown O
in O
recent O
years O
, O
for O
example O
: O
military O
TV O
dramas O
including O
Long O
March O
, O
the O
Eight O
Route O
Army O
and O
Drawing O
Sword O
, O
and O
modern O
- O
theme O
TV O
dramas O
that O
reflect O
rural O
reform O
, O
kinship O
and O
friendship O
including O
Hometown O
, O
My O
Family O
Tree O
and O
Mother O
, O
are O
much O
popular O
among O
viewers O
. O

[wmkj2006] O
Now O
, O
at O
the O
mentioning O
of O
the O
main O
theme O
, O
people O
tend O
to O
equalize O
only O
those O
about O
revolutions O
and O
history O
to O
the O
main O
theme O
. O

As O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
the O
main O
theme O
is O
reflected O
in O
different O
aspects O
of O
society O
. O

[wmkj2006] O
For O
example O
: O
those O
that O
reflect O
the O
socialist O
ideological O
and O
ethical O
progress O
and O
the O
democratic O
and O
legal O
progress O
; O
those O
that O
encourage O
and O
motivate O
people O
to O
work O
hard O
and O
innovate O
for O
the O
national O
prosperity O
, O
people O
's O
happiness O
and O
social O
advancement O
; O
those O
that O
help O
people O
to O
tell O
right O
from O
wrong O
, O
insisting O
on O
anything O
true O
, O
kind O
and O
beautiful O
and O
resisting O
anything O
fake O
, O
evil O
and O
ugly O
; O
and O
those O
that O
depict O
national O
unification O
, O
ethnic O
solidarity O
, O
pleasant O
people O
, O
and O
stable O
society O
and O
politics O
etc. O
are O
what O
the O
main O
theme O
represents O
. O

[wmkj2006] O
It O
does O
not O
follow O
that O
the O
main O
theme O
would O
be O
eulogizing O
a O
specific O
political O
party O
or O
group O
. O

It O
is O
fundamentally O
decided O
by O
people O
's O
value O
orientation O
, O
where O
main O
theme O
is O
what O
people O
welcome O
and O
people O
like O
. O

[wmkj2006] O
I O
believe O
the O
regulation O
released O
by O
the O
State O
Administration O
of O
Radio O
Film O
and O
Television O
is O
appropriate O
and O
at O
the O
right O
time O
, O
in O
that O
it O
will O
help O
to O
prevent O
the O
degradation O
of O
the O
current O
TV O
programs O
, O
advocate O
good O
social O
atmosphere O
and O
right O
values O
among O
people O
, O
and O
establish O
a O
correct O
direction O
of O
public O

I O
remember O
my O
first B-ORDINAL
year O
studying O
at O
Qinghua B-ORG
, O
I O
went O
to O
my O
first B-ORDINAL
elective O
course O
called O
" O
Inspirations O
in O
the O
History O
of O
Physics O
. O
" O

There O
were O
only O
ten B-CARDINAL
or O
so O
of O
us O
who O
had O
chosen O
it O
that O
semester O
. O

The O
teacher O
was O
very O
erudite O
, O
his O
lectures O
were O
very O
lively O
; O
he O
summarized O
all O
of O
the O
recent O
and O
contemporary O
history O
of O
physics O
, O
and O
each O
time O
I O
was O
enthralled O
. O

In O
all O
my B-DATE
five I-DATE
years I-DATE
at O
the O
university O
, O
I O
never O
had O
another O
course O
that O
interesting O
. O

If O
I O
were O
to O
summarize O
this O
course O
, O
it O
would O
be O
: O
the O
greatest O
discoveries O
in O
physics O
all O
had O
their O
own O
necessity O
and O
theoretical O
basis O
-LRB- O
for O
example O
, O
the O
development O
of O
mathematics O
-RRB- O
. O

This O
theory O
can O
also O
be O
applied O
to O
cooking O
. O

One O
day O
I O
wanted O
to O
make O
green O
beans O
and O
bean O
curd O
sheets O
-LRB- O
dried O
tofu O
in O
the O
Northeast O
-RRB- O
. O

Here O
the O
dried O
tofu O
sold O
in O
the O
stores O
is O
all O
compressed O
, O
very O
tough O
. O

So O
I O
normally O
steep O
it O
in O
hot O
water O
, O
then O
take O
it O
out O
and O
stir O
- O
fry O
it O
. O

Because O
that O
day O
I O
needed O
to O
go O
out O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
it O
and O
buy O
some O
things O
, O
I O
set O
the O
timer O
and O
told O
my O
wife O
to O
turn O
off O
the O
heat O
when O
it O
was O
done O
. O

My O
wife O
is O
very O
lazy O
, O
and O
when O
the O
timer O
sounded O
, O
she O
turned O
off O
the O
heat O
and O
left O
the O
pot O
sitting O
on O
the O
stove O
. O

When O
I O
came O
back O
and O
looked O
, O
the O
dried O
tofu O
was O
white O
and O
soft O
, O
just O
like O
freshly O
made O
. O

Chalk O
another O

The O
difficulty O
of O
using O
stamps O
for O
the O
general O
public O
is O
a O
major O
sticking O
point O
. O

For O
historical O
reasons O
, O
the O
discounting O

has O
been O
widespread O

with O

long O

If O

this O

■ O
Collect O

all O
: O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
increase O
the O
number O
of O
stamp O
collectors O
by O
encouraging O
new O
people O
to O
join O
in O
stamp O
collecting O
. O

Second B-ORDINAL
, O
at O
all O
levels O
, O
all O
over O
the O
country O
, O
organize O
specific O
philatelic O
events O
that O
are O
conducive O
to O
a O
healthy O
body O
and O

and O
conducive O
to O

temperament O
. O

Third B-ORDINAL
, O
increase O
guidance O

collectors O
' O
associations O
in O

. O

Fourth B-ORDINAL
, O
promote O
philatelic O
culture O
on O
all O
fronts O
, O
bring O
stamp O
collecting O
events O
into O
schools O
, O
into O

residential O

If O
old O

return O

people O
also O
join O

, O
and O
the O
number O
of O
stamp O
collectors O
again O
reaches O
15 B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
or O
more O
, O
then O
we O
are O
honestly O
a O
little O
doubtful O
whether O
these O
few O
stamps O
will O
be O
enough O
for O
everyone O
to O
share O
. O

If O
there O
are O
n't O
enough O
for O
everyone O
to O
share O
, O
then O
the O
price O
of O
stamps O
will O
naturally O
rise O
. O

This O
would O
then O
naturally O
solve O
the O
problem O
of O
discounted O
stamps O
. O

This O
is O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
way O
to O
get O
rid O

. O

■Buy O
them O
back O
: O
there O
are O
two B-CARDINAL
buy O
- O
back O
methods O
: O
one B-CARDINAL
is O
a O
policy O
buy O
- O
back O
, O
which O
is O
the O
postal O
service O
dealing O
with O
discount O
stamps O
-LRB- O
at O
least O
important O
stamps O
-RRB- O
with O
a O
state O
buy O
- O
back O
. O

At O
present O
this O
seems O
to O
be O
rather O
difficult O
. O

Second B-ORDINAL
is O
a O
market O
buy O
- O
back O
, O
using O
the O
lever O
of O
market O
economy O
. O

This O
takes O
the O
stamps O
bought O
at O
bottom O
discount O
rates O
on O
the O
market O
and O
sells O
them O
again O
to O
the O
public O
to O
use O
on O
correspondence O
, O
speeding O
up O
the O
use O
of O
discount O
stamps O
. O

This O
involves O
the O
restructured O
postal O
administration O
taking O
part O
in O
market O
operations O
, O
reducing O
the O
pressure O
of O
discount O
stamps O
. O

After O
a O
period O
of O
operation O
, O
this O
problem O
can O
be O
solved O
very O
effectively O
. O

This O
approach O
can O
be O
considered O
quite O
a O
realistic O
method O
. O

This O
is O
the O
third B-ORDINAL
way O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
them O
. O

■Controlling O
the O
source O
: O
first B-ORDINAL
is O
that O
you O
absolutely O
can O
not O
think O
that O
because O
the O
price O
of O
stamps O
is O
heading O
back O
towards O
their O
value O
, O
because O
the O
price O
has O
risen O
a O
little O
, O
another O
opportunity O
for O
dumping O
stamps O
at O
low O
prices O
has O
come O
, O
and O
again O
start O
playing O
tricks O
with O
overprints O
. O

This O
is O
the O
limit O
of O
good O
faith O
, O
you O
absolutely O
must O
not O
, O
oh O
, O
this O
is O
a O
must O
. O

From O
the O
facts O
that O
this O
year B-DATE
's O
year B-DATE
stamps O
are O
not O
being O
discounted O
, O
and O
the O
rate O
of O
discount O
on O
discounted O
stamps O
in O
the O
market O
has O
reduced O
significantly O
, O
it O
is O
enough O
to O
show O
that O
the O
postal O
policies O
are O
already O
starting O
to O
have O
an O
effect O
. O

Only O
in O
this O
way O
will O
the O
numbers O
of O
stamps O
on O
the O
market O
start O
to O
decrease O
, O
and O
stamps O
move O
onto O
a O
healthy O
path O
of O
appreciation O
. O

When O
stamps O
have O
risen O
in O
value O
to O
a O
certain O
degree O
, O
even O
if O
you O
ask O
someone O
to O
, O
he O
wo O
n't O
use O
stamps O
that O
are O
worth O
more O
than O
their O
face O
value O
as O
postage O
. O

The O
more O
stamps O
appreciate O
, O
the O
fewer O
stamps O
will O
surely O
be O
used O
as O
postage O
. O

This O
reasoning O
is O
obvious O
. O

Second B-ORDINAL
is O
using O
the O
scientific O
approach O
to O
development O
to O
decide O
the O
quantities O
of O
stamps O
distributed O
. O

When O
the O
quantity O
of O
stamps O
distributed O
is O
large O
or O
too O
great O
, O
the O
practice O
of O
stamp O
collecting O
is O
damaged O
. O

The O
number O
of O
stamp O
collectors O
is O
then O
greatly O
reduced O
. O

This O
has O
been O
proved O
by O
past O
events O
. O

The O
quantities O
distributed O
of O
new O
stamps O
must O
be O
appropriate O
for O
the O
actual O
situation O
. O

It O
is O
unreasonable O
to O
block O
roads O
and O
cut O
off O
traffic O
even O
if O
the O
villagers O
' O
homes O
were O
being O
damaged O
by O
the O
blasting O
for O
road O
construction O
and O
the O
economy O
was O
being O
hurt O
; O
these O
methods O
are O
illegal O
and O
harm O
innocent O
bystanders O
; O
they O
are O
unacceptable O
. O

If O
there O
is O
a O
problem O
, O
they O
should O
seek O
out O
the O
concerned O
departments O
, O
that O
's O
all O
. O

However O
, O
the O
villagers O
' O
agitation O
has O
its O
own O
reasons O
. O

You O
might O
say O
it O
ca O
n't O
be O
helped O
. O

If O
they O
had O
been O
able O
to O
resolve O
the O
problem O
through O
regular O
channels O
, O
they O
would O
n't O
have O
taken O
such O
a O
step O
. O

China B-GPE
's O
peasants O
are O
simple O
and O
decent O
folk O
; O
quite O
often O
when O
they O
get O
the O
short O
end O
of O
the O
stick O
they O
suffer O
in O
silence O
. O

If O
it O
is O
not O
something O
that O
affects O
their O
livelihood O
, O
they O
are O
not O
easily O
moved O
to O
take O
action O
. O

They O
may O
be O
simple O
and O
decent O
and O
may O
accept O
bullying O
, O
but O
when O
someone O
rides O
on O
their O
backs O
and O
dumps O
on O
them O
, O
they O
wo O
n't O
take O
it O
any O
more O
, O
and O
they O
explode O
. O

In O
my O
view O
, O
the O
concerned O
parties O
' O
disregard O
for O
the O
people O
's O
interests O
is O
the O
basic O
reason O
that O
brought O
this O
on O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
in O
this O
disturbance O
both O
the O
villagers O
and O
the O
police O
are O
the O
victims O
of O
bureaucracy O
. O

In O
the O
news O
reports O
, O
we O
clearly O
felt O
that O
the O
behavior O
of O
the O
police O
went O
beyond O
enforcement O
of O
the O
law O
; O
their O
behavior O
infringed O
on O
human O
rights O
. O

For O
example O
, O
when O
the O
dustup O
began O
between O
the O
people O
and O
the O
police O
, O
" O
One O
policeman O
took O
out O
a O
camera O
and O
photographed O
me O
; O
I O
used O
my O
hand O
to O
block O
it O
, O
and O
another O
policeman O
kicked O
me O
in O
the O
stomach O
. O

I O
immediately O
squatted O
down O
, O
and O
then O
they O
beat O
me O
on O
the O
face O
and O
head O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
who O
it O
was O
; O
I O
wiped O
my O
face O
with O
my O
hand O
, O
my O
hand O
was O
full O
of O
blood O
, O
they O
had O
broken O
open O
my O
mouth O
. O
" O

Although O
the O
peasants O
' O
blocking O
the O
road O
was O
against O
the O
law O
, O
the O
police O
can O
maintain O
order O
according O
to O
the O
law O
, O

but O
what O
right O
do O
the O
police O
have O
to O
beat O
people O
and O
even O
to O
kick O
a O
woman O
in O
the O
stomach O
? O
" O

It O
also O
might O
be O
said O
that O
when O
a O
mob O
situation O
arises O
the O
police O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
clash O
with O
the O
people O
; O
most O
often O
the O
police O
are O
following O
orders O
to O
suppress O
the O
mob O
and O
help O
officials O
restore O
order O
. O

In O
life O
, O
some O
local O
government O
officials O
encounter O
problems O
of O
fierce O
resistance O
from O
the O
people O
; O
instead O
of O
thinking O
of O
ways O
to O
smooth O
over O
and O
resolve O
the O
problem O
, O
they O
first B-ORDINAL
think O
of O
suppressing O
it O
, O
and O
they O
're O
accustomed O
to O
mobilizing O
the O
police O
force O
to O
forcefully O
carry O
that O
out O
. O

In O
fact O
the O
harsher O
the O
suppression O
the O
more O
likely O
there O
will O
be O
a O
conflict O
, O
bringing O
on O
even O
greater O
feelings O
of O
opposition O
between O
police O
and O
people O
and O
between O
cadres O
and O
the O
masses O
, O
which O
does O
n't O
help O
resolve O
the O
problem O
. O

Taking O
this O
case O
as O
an O
example O
, O
the O
common O
folk O
blocked O
the O
road O
because O
the O
local O
government O
did O
not O
resolve O
the O
problem O
. O

If O
it O
had O
resolved O
it O
, O
no O
one O
would O
have O
broken O
the O
law O
! O

Although O
you O
can O
say O
that O
blocking O
the O
road O
was O
illegal O
, O
it O
's O
also O
not O
a O
violent O
act O
; O
the O
police O
should O
have O
continued O
directing O
traffic O
, O
and O
they O
might O
not O
have O
resorted O
so O
quickly O
to O
force O
. O

Who O
brought O
about O
the O
clash O
between O
the O
police O
and O
the O
villagers O
? O

Who O
bears O
responsibility O
?! O

I O
believe O
we O
should O
first B-ORDINAL
look O
into O
the O
local O
government O
's O
nonfeasance O
in O
ignoring O
the O
interests O
of O
the O
people O
. O

" O
The O
interests O
of O
the O
masses O
are O
no O
small O
matter O
" O
is O
not O
just O
a O
slogan O
; O
it O
needs O
to O
be O
made O
real O
. O

Now O
that O
there O
has O
been O
this O
disturbance O
, O
the O
concerned O
parties O
need O
to O
be O
vigilant O
; O
they O
take O
the O
initiative O
and O
pay O
compensation O
for O
the O
reinforcement O
work O
, O
sooner O
rather O
than O
later O
. O

The O
reason O
is O
very O
simple O
: O
people O
's O
homes O
, O
which O
were O
originally O
unstable O
, O
can O
still O
be O
maintained O
for O
several B-DATE
more I-DATE
years I-DATE
; O
this O
shock O
was O
n't O
caused O
by O
the O
people O
, O
and O
compensation O
should O
be O
paid O
. O

Moreover O
, O
it O
is O
useless O
to O
quibble O
further O
about O
how O
much O
money O
should O
be O
spent O
on O
the O
compensation O
issue O
. O

I O
believe O
there O
is O
only O
one B-CARDINAL
standard O
: O
if O
someone O
's O
house O
was O
destroyed O
, O
the O
party O
who O
destroyed O
it O
should O
restore O
it O
to O
its O
original O
condition O
, O
without O
regard O
to O
how O
much O
money O
the O
damage O
is O
worth O
, O
afraid O
to O
spend O
one B-MONEY
red I-MONEY
cent I-MONEY
; O
just O
restore O
it O
to O
the O
original O
condition O
. O

If O
the O
wrangling O
over O
the O
compensation O
issue O
goes O
on O
forever O
, O
then O
I O
believe O
the O
government O
is O
still O
not O
sincere O
in O
resolving O
the O
matter O
of O
the O
people O
's O
interests O
; O
if O
it O
drags O
on O
and O
on O
, O
it O
will O
only O
intensify O
the O
conflict O
and O
make O
the O
people O
angry O
, O
and O
history O
will O
repeat O
itself O
. O

Do O
, O
keep O
bullying O
the O
peasants O
; O
they O
have O
it O
tough O
enough O
! O

The O
peasants O
have O
suffered O
enough O
! O

Give O
them O
the O
means O
to O
live O

I O

rumors O
started O
flying O
, O
everybody O
said O
his O

murdered O
him O
. O

The O
two B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
had O

together O
for O
many B-DATE

and O
at O
the O
time O
their O
two B-CARDINAL
children O
were O

This O
man O
was O
very O
honest O
, O
and O
the O
woman O
had O
always O
been O
very O
sociable O
, O
and O
even O
though O
the O
medical O
examiner O
had O
already O
examined O
the O
body O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
where O
all O
this O
talk O
came O
from O
, O
but O
the O
man O
's O
family O
insisted O
on O
reopening O
the O
casket O
and O
re-examining O
it O
. O

This O
affair O
stirred O
up O
quite O
a O
hubbub O
in O
our O
little O
town O
. O

My O
mom O
, O
too O
, O
just O
kept O
discussing O
it O
on O
and O
on O
. O

To O
my O
mind O
it O
was O
totally O
uninteresting O
, O
I O
just O
felt O
these O
middle O
- O
aged O
women O
were O
extremely O
suspicious O
, O
and O
I O
could O
n't O
see O
what O
all O
the O
fuss O
was O
over O
that O
woman O
. O

Then O
one B-DATE
day I-DATE
my O
mom O
was O
at O
the O
table O
, O
the O
saliva O
spraying O
, O
and O
I O
just O
could O
n't O
stand O
it O
anymore O
. O

Mom O
, O
do O
n't O
keep O
repeating O
what O
other O
people O
say O
, O
OK O
? O

You O
say O
somebody O
killed O
somebody O
; O
what O
proof O
do O
you O
have O
? O

My O
mom O
rapped O
her O
chopsticks O
on O
the O
table O
: O
You O
're O
just O
a O
kid O
, O
what O
do O
you O
know O
? O

There O
are O
no O
waves O
without O
wind O
; O
if O
this O
were O
nothing O
, O
people O
would O
n't O
be O
talking O
about O
it O
so O
much O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
dare O
answer O
the O
old O
lady O
back O
, O
but O
I O
thought O
to O
myself O
: O
Just O
wait O
and O
see O
, O
wait O
until O
this O
woman O
has O
been O
proven O
innocent O
, O
then O
you O
wo O
n't O
have O
anything O
to O
say O
. O

This O
woman O
was O
really O
quite O
a O
character O
; O
not O
only O
was O
she O
on O
good O
terms O
with O
some O
of O
the O
bigwigs O
at O
the O
plant O
, O
she O
was O
also O
quite O
familiar O
with O
the O
head O
of O
the O
city O
's O
public O
security O
bureau O
, O
who O
had O
been O
transferred O
over O
temporarily O
from O
the O
plant O
. O

The O
matter O
of O
whether O
to O
open O
the O
casket O
dragged O
on O
and O
on O
, O
and O
finally O
, O
because O
the O
pressure O
from O
public O
opinion O
was O
so O
great O
, O
they O
re-examined O
the O
body O
, O
and O
the O
result O
was O
poisoning O
. O

When O
that O
came O
out O
, O
everybody O
was O
in O
an O
uproar O
. O

To O
calm O
the O
public O
, O
finally O
there O
was O
a O
trial O
, O
and O
the O
woman O
was O
found O
guilty O
of O
murdering O
her O
husband O
. O

Everybody O
felt O
that O
, O
in O
such O
a O
case O
, O
she O
would O
certainly O
get O
the O
death O
penalty O
, O
but O
she O
was O
given O
a O
stay O
of O
execution O
. O

After O
several B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
the O
head O
of O
the O
city O
's O
public O
security O
bureau O
became O
head O
of O
the O
provincial O
public O
security O
department O
, O
and O
then O
some O
people O
said O
that O
again O
this O
woman O
might O
show O
up O
in O
the O
provincial O
capital O
. O

I O
think O
that O
if O
the O
world O
did O
not O
have O
" O
wretched O
men O
" O
who O
waste O
endless O
time O
tangled O
up O
in O
this O
sort O
of O
thing O
like O
Cui O
's O
, O
or O
" O
big O
- O
mouthed O
women O
" O
like O
my O
mother O
, O
people O
like O
them O
, O
who O
I O
feel O
have O
always O
been O
good O
at O
certain O
things O
, O
then O
people O
would O
be O
able O
to O
get O
away O
with O
murder O
or O
other O
crimes O
. O

I O
am O
very O
grateful O
to O
my O

, O
because O
they O
have O
given O
up O
way O
too O
much O
for O

[duduyuu] O
They O
have O
done O
everything O
they O
could O
for O
my O

[duduyuu] O
Thinking O
about O

, O
I O
was O
really O
insensible O
. O

[duduyuu] O
My O

made O
the O

too O

Thinking O
about O
what O
my O

did O
and O
what O
my O

did O
, O
what O
I O
did O
was O
indeed O
nothing O

[duduyuu] O
Growing O
up O
is O
painful O
, O
growing O
up O
lonely O
is O
more O
painful O

but O
the O
process O
of O
growing O
up O
is O
happy O

and O
the O
result O
of O
growing O
up O
will O
also O
hopefully O
make O
all O

[duduyuu] O
Actually O
sometimes O
we O
grow O
up O
for O
ourselves O
, O

also O
for O
all O

When O
I O

I O
always O
thought O
I O
was O
the O
most O
wretched O
person O
in O
the O
world O
under O
the O
greatest O
stress O
and O
felt O
no O
one O
endured O
more O
hardships O
as O
I O
did O
. O

[duduyuu] O
In O
fact O
, O
today O
's O
achievement O
is O
the O
result O
of O
many O
people O
's O
efforts O

[duduyuu] O
In O
fact O
, O
my O
parents O
were O
also O
reluctant O
to O
send O
me O
to O
the O
United O

, O
but O
they O
needed O
to O
endure O
a O
lot O
for O
me O
. O

Even O
today O
, O
I O
still O
feel O
myself O
wretched O
when O
I O
am O
under O
pressure O
and O
work O
really O
hard O
. O

[duduyuu] O
But O
think O
about O
many O
people O
around O
me O
and O
many O
people O
closest O
to O
me O
, O
who O
can O
also O
feel O
my O

are O
under O
stress O

enduring O
[duduyuu] O
hardships O
too O

their O

are O
no O

Wenhai B-PERSON

While O
I O
was O
watching O
a O
TV O
channel O
, O
I O
heard O
from O
its O
news O
, O
" O
the O
tallest O
building O
beside O
the B-LOC
West I-LOC
Lake I-LOC
in O
Hangzhou B-GPE
was O
blast O
demolished O
only O
14 B-DATE
years I-DATE
after O
completion O
, O
because O
it O
ruined O
the O
West B-LOC
Lake I-LOC
views O
. O
" O

It O
is O
said O
blasting O
this O
" O
image O
project O
" O
reflects O
" O
the O
scientific O
view O
of O
development O
" O
of O
this O
Hangzhou B-GPE
government O
. O

It O
is O
unbelievable O
to O
see O
the O
report O
associate O
the O
blast O
demolition O
with O
the O
scientific O
view O
of O
development O
. O

The O
high O
riser O
has O
only O
been O
used O
for O
14 B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

What O
does O
it O
mean O
by O
14 B-DATE
years I-DATE
? O

If O
some O
messy O
buildings O
are O
left O
undecorated O
after O
six O
years O
of O
completion O
, O
I O
think O
it O
is O
not O
inappropriate O
at O
all O
to O
describe O
14 B-DATE
years I-DATE
as O
" O
brand O
new O
. O
" O

It O
took O
such O
a O
great O
fortune O
to O
build O
a O
high O
riser O
like O
this O
, O
and O
now O
it O
is O
blasted O
at O
an O
order O
. O

How O
wasteful O
it O
is O
in O
ordinary O
people O
's O
eyes O
. O

I O
will O
never O
ever O
believe O
everyone O
in O
Hangzhou B-GPE
has O
a O
place O
to O
live O
in O
without O
any O
impoverished O
households O
. O

If O
such O
a O
great O
fortune O
was O
from O
government O
appropriation O
, O
how O
many O
tax O
payers O
were O
needed O
? O

If O
it O
was O
invested O
by O
some O
business O
person O
, O
how O
many O
machines O
were O
needed O
to O
run O
and O
how O
many O
workers O
were O
needed O
to O
be O
busy O
? O

How O
many O
people O
can O
receive O
education O
and O
healthcare O
, O
among O
other O
things O
, O
with O
such O
a O
great O
fortune O
? O

What O
is O
the O
scientific O
view O
of O
development O
? O

The O
core O
is O
putting O
people O
first B-ORDINAL
. O

The O
scientific O
view O
of O
development O
will O
never O
waste O
resources O
at O
will O
, O
or O
let O
people O
bleed O
and O
toil O
in O
vain O
. O

The O
scientific O
view O
of O
development O
emphasizes O
a O
conservation O
- O
minded O
society O
. O

The O
scientific O
view O
of O
development O
focuses O
on O
urban O
planning O
. O

Maybe O
some O
people O
say O
this O
tall O
building O
has O
ruined O
the O
West B-LOC
Lake I-LOC
views O
, O
and O
now O
we O
have O
attached O
importance O
to O
the O
scientific O
view O
of O
development O
. O

I O
would O
say O
please O
wait O
. O

If O
Hangzhou B-GPE
has O
only O
this O
one B-CARDINAL
" O
image O
project O
, O
" O
the O
blast O
of O
which O
could O
restore O
its O
original O
state O
, O
it O
can O
be O
barely O
regarded O
as O
" O
scientific O
development O
. O
" O

The O
problem O
is O
whether O
it O
will O
work O
? O

Hangzhou B-GPE
belongs O
to O
people O
of O
the O
entire O
nation O
. O

So O
many O
Chinese B-NORP
have O
been O
to O
Hangzhou B-GPE
. O

The B-FAC
Leifeng I-FAC
Tower I-FAC
was O
fallen O
down O
for B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
which O
also O
symbolized O
the O
emancipation O
of O
Chinese B-NORP
women O
, O
but O
later O
on O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
was O
invested O
to O
build O
a O
fake O
tower O
standing O
beside O
the B-LOC
West I-LOC
Lake I-LOC
. O

A O
tour O
guide O
said O
: O
" O
people O
often O
went O
up O
to O
explore O
the O
relics O
before O
it O
was O
built O
, O
but O
they O
have O
become O
reluctant O
to O
go O
up O
after O
it O
was O
built O
. O
" O

This O
affects O
the B-LOC
West I-LOC
Lake I-LOC
, O
reducing O
tourists O
at O
the O
scenic O
spot O
. O

Should O
we O
also O
push O
over O
the O
fake O
Leifeng B-FAC
Tower I-FAC
? O

Even O
if O
it O
were O
pushed O
over O
, O
would O
things O
go O
back O
to O
" O
people O
going O
up O
to O
explore O
relics O
? O
" O

Thus O
, O
blasting O
the O
high O
riser O
can O
not O
be O
associated O
with O
the O
scientific O
view O
of O
development O
. O

When O
it O
was O
first B-ORDINAL
built O
, O
it O
was O
for O
image O
in O
spite O
of O
public O
objections O
. O

Some O
netizens O
even O
said O
it O
was O
for O
political O
feats O
, O
dining O
out O
, O
going O
on O
inspection O
tours O
, O
contract O
awarding O
, O
and O
various O
other O
benefits O
. O

If O
the O
construction O
was O
for O
image O
, O
then O
the O
scientific O
view O
of O
development O
should O
never O
be O
the O
excuse O
for O
its O
blast O
demolition O
. O

If O
it O
is O
really O
designed O
to O
implement O
the O
scientific O
view O
of O
development O
, O
then O
simply O
erect O
a O
plate O
at O
the O
" O
fake O
Leifeng B-FAC
Tower I-FAC
, O
" O
which O
indicates O
" O
who O
" O
managed O
the O
construction O
of O
the O
fake O
tower O
. O

I O
guarantee O
there O
will O
be O
tourists O
exploring O
relics O

money O
, O
I O
chose O
the B-ORG
University I-ORG
of I-ORG
Science I-ORG
and I-ORG
Technology I-ORG
of I-ORG
China I-ORG
. O

Years B-DATE
later I-DATE
, O
looking O
back O
on O
this O
choice O
, O
I O
certainly O
do O
not O
have O
any O
regrets O
. O

Perhaps O
if O
I O
'd O
chosen O
two B-CARDINAL
schools O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
, O
I O
would O
n't O
be O
here O
today O
talking O
about O
how O
USTC B-ORG
is O
. O

But O
USTC B-ORG
at O
the O
time O
was O
weak O
; O
considering O
location O
, O
expenses O
, O
promotion O
and O
connections O
, O
USTC B-ORG
's O
greatest O
wealth O
was O
its O
students O
. O

If O
we O
had O
n't O
come O
forward O
and O
done O
something O
for O
USTC B-ORG
, O
it O
would O
have O
been O
finished O
. O

This O
is O
also O
the O
main O
reason O
USTC B-ORG
students O
banded O
together O
. O

Because O
I O
chose O
science O
and O
technology O
as O
my O
career O
, O
I O
am O
grateful O
to O
USTC B-ORG
for O
teaching O
me O
many O
things O
, O
and O
I O
am O
grateful O
to O
the O
reputation O
established O
by O
the O
previous O
president O
of O
the O
university O
, O
who O
enabled O
those O
who O
came O
after O
to O
benefit O
from O
it O
. O

Precisely O
because O
I O
feel O
this O
gratitude O
, O
I O
want O
to O
repay O
USTC B-ORG
. O

I O
regularly O
do O
my O
job O
properly O
and O
do O
not O
let O
USTC B-ORG
lose O
face O
. O

I O
want O
to O
save O
money O
out O
of O
my O
meager O
fellowship O
to O
help O
a O
poor O
university O
student O
with O
his O
living O
expenses O
for O
four B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

I O
want O
to O
go O
back O
to O
China B-GPE
to O
make O
my O
contributions O
; O
I O
also O
want O
to O
provide O
the O
needed O
help O
to O
future O
students O
of O
my O
university O
. O

When O
I O
see O
people O
attacking O
USTC B-ORG
, O
I O
sometimes O
want O
to O
take O
the O
time O
to O
defend O
it O
, O
even O
though O
that O
may O
not O
help O
much O
. O

Those O
USTC B-ORG
haters O
have O
their O
own O
reasons O
; O
I O
do O
n't O
intend O
to O
change O
their O
thinking O
. O

But O
with O
China B-GPE
's O
universities O
being O
so O
backward O
, O
what O
contributions O
have O
these O
naysayers O
really O
made O
to O
their O
alma O
maters O
and O
their O
country O
? O

Like O
gaddy B-PERSON
, O
for O
example O
, O
who O
first O
badmouths O
USTC B-ORG
students O
for O
not O
wanting O
to O
contribute O
money O
, O
says O
he O
himself O
has O
some O
money O
, O
and O
then O
wants O
to O
spend O
money O
filing O
a O
lawsuit O
because O
of O
a O
dispute O
over O
personal O
feelings O
on O
the O
bbs O
. O

This O
hater O
really O
has O
some O
problems O
of O
his O
own O
. O

After O
graduating O
, O
I O
will O
go O
back O
; O
no O
matter O
where O
I O
work O
, O
I O
'm O
still O
a O
USTC B-ORG
student O
, O
and O
I O
have O
no O
regrets O
about O
USTC B-ORG
and O
no O
regrets O
about O
my O
country O
. O

The O
country O
's O
first B-ORDINAL
civilian O
- O
operated O
airline O
is O
headquartered O
in O
Shanghai B-GPE
. O

The O
first B-ORDINAL
impression O
is O
that O
the O
English B-LANGUAGE
name O
is O
too O
vulgar O
, O
china-sss.com B-ORG
, O
would O
anybody O
be O
interested O
in O
putting O
this O
company O

announcement O
on O
Jay B-PERSON
Leno I-PERSON
? O

I O
heard O
people O
saying O
the O
ticket O
prices O
are O
cheap O
. O

Then O
I O
went O
online O
and O
looked O
; O
there O
are O
A O
and O
B O
classes O
, O
but O
no O

Every O

a O

The O
ticket O
prices O
are O
certainly O
the O
cheapest O
. O

Chunqiu B-ORG
is O
encouraging O
online O
booking O
with O
a O
30 B-MONEY
- I-MONEY
yuan I-MONEY
discount O
, O
which O
saves O
on O
costs O
. O

But O
paying O
online O
in O
China B-GPE
is O
extremely O
complicated O
; O
that O
's O
another O
story O
. O

The O
baggage O
limit O
is O
15 B-QUANTITY
kg I-QUANTITY
, O
but O
I O
see O
lots O
of O
people O
whose O
baggage O
are O
definitely O
over O
that O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
see O
complete O
data O
online O
for O
their O
flight O
safety O
record O
. O

The O
A320 B-PRODUCT
model O
is O
one O
commonly O
used O
only O
on O
minor O
routes O
. O

The O
planes O
are O
not O
as O
old O
as O
the O
same O
models O
in O
the B-GPE
U. I-GPE
S. I-GPE

Signs O
say O
the O
life O
vests O
are O
under O
the O
seats O
, O
but O
in O
fact O
under O
the O
seats O
it O
's O
absolutely O
empty O
. O

Someone O
next O
to O
me O
asked O
the O
flight O
attendant O
, O
and O
she O
was O
unable O
to O
answer O
. O

A O
male O
flight O
attendant O
then O
said O
there O
were O
no O
life O
vests O
. O

After O
I O
got O
back O
to O
the O
States B-GPE
I O
hitched O
a O
ride O
on O
a O
plane O
of O
the O
same O
model O
, O
and O
the O
signs O
said O
the O
seat O
padding O
could O
be O
used O
as O
a O
flotation O
device O
. O

That O
must O
be O
correct O
. O

On O
board O
, O
aside O
from O
a O
small O
bottle O
of O
water O
, O
no O
beverages O
were O
offered O
, O
but O
they O
were O
selling O
boxed O
meals O
, O
all O
of O
them O
with O
the O
same O
packaging O
, O
for O
￥28 B-MONEY
a O
box O
. O

There O
were O
also O
soy O
- O
sauce O
eggs O
, O
preserved O
eggs O
, O
peanuts O
and O
other O
snacks O
. O

I O
do O
not O
feel O
that O
this O
is O
a O
good O
approach O
on O
brief O
short O
- O
haul O
passenger O
flights O
. O

First B-ORDINAL
, O
they O
have O
to O
remember O
the O
passenger O
's O
order O
and O
seat O
number O
, O
collect O
the O
money O
-LRB- O
and O
check O
for O
counterfeits O
-RRB- O
. O
Then O
heat O
the O
meal O
, O
deliver O
the O
meal O
... O
there O
's O
more O
than O
just O
one B-CARDINAL
type O
of O
meal O
, O
and O
the O
preparation O
is O
n't O
always O
simple O
. O

It O
's O
all O
helter O
- O
skelter O
enough O
. O

Many O
people O
were O
still O
eating O
just O
before O
the O
plane O
landed O
. O

Plus O
they O
also O
enthusiastically O
peddle O
gifts O
to O
earn O
extra O
income O
. O
Such O
as O
model O
airplanes O
, O
dolls O
... O

I O
saw O
one B-CARDINAL
person O
pay O
200 B-CARDINAL
for O
a O
model O
airplane O
. O

In O
order O
to O
reduce O
the O
number O
of O
empty O
seats O
, O
the O
plane O
even O
has O
passengers O
going O
to O
different O
destinations O
; O
after O
the O
plane O
landed O
at O
Shanghai B-GPE
, O
those O
people O
stayed O
on O
the O
plane O
and O
waited O
for O
the O
cabin O
to O
be O
cleaned O
and O
tidied O
, O
and O
only O
after O
new O
passengers O
were O
boarded O
did O
they O
continue O
on O
their O
way O
. O

After O
we O
landed O
at O
Shanghai B-GPE
, O
an O
airport O
bus O
transferred O
us O
; O
they O
did O
n't O
use O
the O
bridge O
. O

They O
said O
this O
was O
another O
cost O
- O
saving O
measure O
. O

In O
short O
, O
the O
plane O
was O
on O
time O
, O
the O
baggage O
was O
delivered O
quickly O
, O
and O
the O
service O
was O
OK O
. O

This O
kind O
of O
train O
- O
like O
business O
approach O
is O
rather O
unusual O

alvarado O

[alvarado] O
This O
semester O
I O
took O
a O
professional O
writing O
course O
, O
the O
teacher O
's O
lectures O
were O
very O
interesting O
, O
about O
how O
to O
frame O
an O
article O
, O
lots O
of O
it O
was O
stuff O
I O
previously O
overlooked O
. O

Here O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
present O
it O
for O
everyone O
to O
share O
. O

[alvarado] O
Warning O
: O
the O
technique O
does O
n't O
guarantee O
that O
your O
article O
will O
be O
published O
; O
to O
a O
very O
large O
extent O
this O
will O
be O
determined O
by O
the O
quality O
of O
your O
work O
. O

[alvarado] O
How O
to O
frame O
the O
article O
and O
how O
to O
master O
some O
tricks O
are O
very O
, O
very O
useful O
. O

[alvarado] O
One O
extreme O
case O
is O
a O
professor O
who O
originally O
graduated O
from O
our O
department O
; O
you O
could O
say O
she O
's O
one O
of O
America O
's O
best O
field O
workers O
, O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
things O
she O
does O
is O
extremely O
high O
, O
and O
most O
people O
do O
n't O
attain O
the O
difficulty O
of O
her O
field O
work O
. O

[alvarado] O
She O
is O
able O
to O
get O
low O
- O
income O
single O
mothers O
to O
record O
their O
income O
and O
expenditures O
every O
month O
and O
can O
also O
get O
them O
to O
tell O
her O
their O
sources O
of O
unlawful O
income O
. O

[alvarado] O
Plus O
, O
she O
's O
white O
, O
the O
product O
of O
a O
middle O
- O
class O
home O
, O
and O
the O
targets O
of O
her O
research O
are O
almost O
all O
black O
and O
Latina O
. O

[alvarado] O
But O
the O
early O
articles O
she O
published O
, O
despite O
having O
a O
large O
influence O
, O
were O
a O
failure O
in O
terms O
of O
structure O
. O

[alvarado] O
The O
most O
interesting O
thing O
is O
that O
she O
first O
went O
to O
Rutgers O
-LRB- O
in O
this O
discipline O
it O
's O
a O
second O
- O
tier O
school O
-RRB- O
, O
but O
she O
did O
n't O
get O
tenure O
. O

Our O
teacher O
is O
a O
friend O
of O
hers O
and O
says O
the O
main O
reason O
is O
that O
she O
ca O
n't O
write O
articles O
, O
and O
the O
number O
published O
is O
rather O
low O
. O

[alvarado] O
Later O
, O
after O
she O
figured O
it O
out O
, O
based O
on O
her O
original O
work O
, O
she O
published O
a O
series O
of O
extremely O
diverse O
articles O
, O
and O
she O
continued O
her O
original O
work O
; O
she O
put O
out O
a O
very O
influential O
book O
, O
and O
needless O
to O
say O
she O
got O
tenure O
at O
a O
name O
school O
. O

[alvarado] O
Next O
semester O
she O
's O
going O
from O
UPenn O
to O
Harvard O
, O
and O
she O
may O
be O
the O
chair O
at O
Harvard O
. O

[alvarado] O
So O
even O
a O
fine O
wine O
wo O
n't O
get O
sold O
if O
it O
's O
hidden O
away O
; O
good O
material O
needs O
to O
be O
highlighted O
. O

[alvarado] O
What O
are O
the O
tricks O
here O
? O

[alvarado] O
If O
you O
've O
already O
had O
articles O
published O
in O
top O
social O
science O
periodicals O
, O
no O
need O
to O
continue O
reading O
. O

[alvarado] O
First O
, O
the O
abstract O
and O
the O
first O
three O
pages O
determine O
who O
it O
will O
be O
reviewed O
by O
and O
even O
whether O
it O
will O
be O
accepted O
. O

[alvarado] O
The O
writer O
needs O
to O
be O
able O
to O
manipulate O
the O
editor O
; O
do O
n't O
let O
the O
editor O
manipulate O
you O
. O

[alvarado] O
For O
example O
, O
right O
off O
the O
bat O
you O
need O
to O
point O
out O
what O
area O
your O
research O
makes O
a O
contribution O
to O
; O
you O
need O
to O
be O
completely O
specific O
, O
do O
n't O
beat O
around O
the O
bush O
. O

[alvarado] O
The O
editor O
ca O
n't O
understand O
everything O
; O
he O
first O
looks O
at O
the O
opening O
and O
the O
abstract O
, O
and O
it O
's O
in O
field O
A O
; O
all O
right O
, O
he O
picks O
four O
folks O
out O
of O
a O
reviewer O
pool O
. O

[alvarado] O
Therefore O
you O
definitely O
need O
to O
make O
clear O
who O
your O
targeted O
reviewer O
is O
. O

[alvarado] O
This O
is O
my O
inserted O
comment O
-RRB- O
The O
problem O
my O
Chinese O
classmates O
easily O
fall O
into O
is O
, O
let O
's O
say O
in O
the O
context O
of O
China O
, O
which O
issue O
is O
very O
important O
, O
which O
issue O
does O
my O
article O
seek O
to O
resolve O
, O
all O
right O
, O
maybe O
I O
can O
get O
it O
into O
China O
Quarterly O
, O
it O
could O
go O
into O
that O
kind O
of O
publication O
. O

[alvarado] O
But O
if O
you O
want O
to O
get O
it O
into O
a O
specialized O
publication O
, O
then O
you O
need O
to O
point O
out O
what O
contribution O
this O
China O
case O
makes O
to O
the O
field O
, O
otherwise O
it O
wo O
n't O
be O
sent O
out O
for O
review O
and O
that O
will O
kill O
it O
. O

[alvarado] O
Next O
, O
what O
should O
you O
do O
when O
your O
target O
may O
be O
two O
different O
fields O
? O

[alvarado] O
One O
strategic O
choice O
is O
to O
figure O
out O
what O
your O
selling O
point O
is O
, O
which O
field O
your O
selling O
point O
is O
more O
fresh O
and O
important O
for O
, O
then O
target O
it O
at O
that O
field O
. O

[alvarado] O
For O
example O
, O
if O
you O
feel O
your O
article O
is O
significant O
for O
two O
fields O
, O
A O
and O
B O
, O
but O
one O
important O
point O
in O
it O
is O
conventional O
wisdom O
in O
field O
A O
, O
but O
it O
is O
something O
new O
in O
field O
B O
, O
then O
target O
it O
at O
B O
. O

[alvarado] O
Also O
, O
highlight O
your O
selling O
point O
. O

[alvarado] O
Or O
if O
it O
's O
a O
new O
model O
, O
variable O
, O
data O
, O
method O
, O
point O
, O
etc. O
, O
you O
should O
certainly O
highlight O
it O
, O
give O
it O
more O
space O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
failed O
articles O
by O
that O
teacher O
we O
mentioned O
above O
basically O
did O
not O
highlight O
the O
difficulty O
and O
innovation O
of O
the O
data O
collected O
-LRB- O
the O
selling O
point O
-RRB- O
but O
just O
spent O
one O
paragraph O
on O
it O
and O
moved O
on O
. O

[alvarado] O
Also O
, O
do O
not O
offend O
your O
reviewers O
. O

[alvarado] O
Like O
a O
really O
poor O
literature O
review O
, O
other O
people O
before O
me O
were O
all O
wrong O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
right O
with O
this O
. O

[alvarado] O
Of O
course O
no O
one O
would O
be O
stupid O
enough O
to O
say O
it O
directly O
like O
that O
, O
but O
many O
failed O
articles O
contain O
that O
kind O
of O
thinking O
. O

[alvarado] O
The O
correct O
approach O
is O
that O
previous O
authors O
did O
well O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
pushing O
it O
a O
step O
further O
. O

[alvarado] O
Or O
previous O
authors O
did O
A O
, O
B O
and O
C O
, O
they O
've O
already O
discussed O
everything O
fully O
, O
but O
it O
seems O
they O
overlooked O
D O
, O
which O
has O
a O
major O
impact O
on O
our O
understanding O
of O
the O
field O
as O
a O
whole O
or O
a O
certain O
question O
. O

[alvarado] O
Or O
previous O
writers O
had O
models O
ABC O
, O
they O
all O
explained O
a O
lot O
of O
questions O
, O
but O
some O
questions O
they O
were O
unable O
to O
explain O
, O
and O
my O
D O
can O
explain O
these O
while O
at O
the O
same O
time O
including O
ABC O
, O
etc O
. O

[alvarado] O
In O
short O
, O
do O
n't O
imply O
that O
" O
all O
the O
people O
are O
stupid O
. O
" O

[alvarado] O
Finally O
, O
there O
is O
also O
a O
type O
of O
research O
that O
debunks O
a O
popular O
view O
or O
research O
on O
a O
hot O
topic O
; O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
it O
also O
has O
theoretical O
significance O
, O
so O
you O
want O
to O
put O
something O
eye O
- O
catching O
right O
up O
front O
so O
people O
can O
see O
it O
, O
put O
the O
public O
debate O
up O
front O
and O
the O
theoretical O
things O
after O
. O

[alvarado] O
These O
are O
all O
little O
tricks O
; O
be O
careful O
they O
do O
n't O
turn O
into O
overkill O
, O
LOL O
. O

-- O
[alvarado] O

[alvarado] O
Be O
with O
the O
crowd O
, O
be O
alone O
, O
know O
your O
strengths O
and O
weaknesses O
; O
speak O
not O
and O
hear O
not O
, O
be O
muddleheaded O
; O
shun O

cultivate O

be O

is O
to O
improve O
your O

To O
elaborate O
, O
it O
means O
there O
should O
be O
a O
special O
role O
in O
your O
mind O
who O
possesses O
" O
the O
third B-ORDINAL
eye O
" O
mentally O
to O
observe O
your O
emotional O
changes O
sensibly O
and O
find O
out O
the O
reasons O
for O
mental O
disturbances O
. O

It O
is O
just O
like O
the O
" O
guardian O
angel O
" O
whom O
everyone O
has O
in O
Western B-NORP
legends O
, O
who O
gives O
you O
wisdom O
at O
critical O
moments O
and O
help O
you O
deal O
with O
the O
intricate O
reality O
properly O
, O
so O
that O
you O
will O
not O
lose O
direction O
. O

There O
was O
a O
famous O
British B-NORP
psychologist O
named O
Ellis B-PERSON
in O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
century I-DATE
, O
who O
encouraged O
people O
to O
learn O
a O
special O
, O
reasonable O
and O
healthy O
way O
of O
thinking O
by O
reading O
professional O
books O
, O
organizing O
group O
discussions O
and O
doing O
specific O
training O
in O
thinking O
, O
in O
order O
to O
deal O
with O
emotional O
problems O
caused O
by O
stresses O
. O

He O
should O
be O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
one O
to O
advocate O
" O
learn O
to O
be O
your O
own O
psychiatrist O
. O
" O

He O
encourages O
people O
to O
learn O
a O
new O
way O
of O
thinking O
like O
" O
learning O
a O
foreign O
language O
. O
" O

The O
most O
important O
aspect O
in O
being O
your O
own O
psychiatrist O
is O
to O
learn O
to O
substitute O
the O
healthy O
way O
of O
thinking O
for O
the O
unhealthy O
way O
of O
thinking O
. O

For O
example O
, O
ask O
two B-CARDINAL
people O
to O
observe O
the O
same O
glass O
, O
if O
one O
notices O
a O
tiny O
speckle O
and O
the O
other O
notices O
the O
mild O
color O
, O
then O
the O
former O
's O
thinking O
pattern O
might O
be O
pessimistic O
, O
while O
the O
latter O
might O
be O
more O
sensitive O
to O
the O
positive O
aspect O
of O
things O
, O
which O
is O
a O
healthy O
and O
optimistic O
way O
of O
thinking O
. O

Thus O
, O
learn O
to O
observe O
the O
positive O
aspect O
of O
things O
has O
become O
an O
important O
training O
. O

To O
be O
your O
own O
psychiatrist O
, O
you O
should O
also O
learn O
to O
observe O
stress O
- O
related O
signs O
. O

For O
example O
, O
if O
you O
have O
a O
stomachache O
, O
your O
normal O
response O
is O
to O
see O
a O
gastroenterologist O
. O

Through O
observation O
by O
" O
the O
third B-ORDINAL
eye O
, O
" O
you O
may O
see O
that O
the O
reason O
can O
be O
your O
new O
demanding O
boss O
. O

To O
be O
your O
own O
psychiatrist O
, O
you O
also O
need O
to O
learn O
appropriate O
knowledge O
. O

There O
was O
a O
student O
at O
the B-ORG
Tsinghua I-ORG
University I-ORG
, O
who O
were O
troubled O
by O
" O
depression O
" O
for O
a O
while O
. O

When O
it O
was O
bad O
, O
he O
wanted O
to O
jump O
out O
and O
commit O
suicide O
at O
the O
sight O
of O
a O
window O
. O

With O
some O
psychological O
knowledge O
, O
he O
knew O
it O
was O
a O
symptom O
of O
mental O
disorder O
, O
so O
he O
immediately O
sought O
help O
from O
professionals O
and O
received O
treatment O
soon O
. O

Now O
in O
many O
European B-NORP
and O
American B-NORP
countries O
, O
some O
intellectuals O
including O
young O
college O
students O
like O
to O
read O
psychological O
books O
. O

Psychological O
books O
can O
always O
be O
seen O
in O
the O
best O
seller O
lists O
in O
these O
countries O
. O

Most O
readers O
do O
not O
aim O
to O
become O
counsellors O
, O
but O
to O
learn O
psychological O
knowledge O
to O
help O
personal O
growth O

Such O

（一） O

For O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
people O
, O
today B-DATE
is O
a O
special O
day O
. O

This B-DATE
day I-DATE
came O
with O
great O
difficulty O
for O
China B-GPE
. O

Before O
the O
war O
, O
the O
gap O
between O
China B-GPE
and O
Japan B-GPE
was O
far O
greater O
than O
mere O
numbers O
. O

Before O
the O
war O
, O
China B-GPE
's O
steel O
production O
was O
less O
than O
200,000 B-QUANTITY
tons I-QUANTITY
-LRB- O
steel O
production O
in O
China B-GPE
was O
centered O
mainly O
in O
the O
northeast O
, O
and O
it O
was O
controlled O
by O
the O
Japanese B-NORP
-RRB- O
. O

Japan B-GPE
's O
was O
about O
9 B-QUANTITY
million I-QUANTITY
tons I-QUANTITY
. O

The O
important O
thing O
is O
that O
Japan B-GPE
had O
a O
complete O
industrial O
system O
and O
was O
able O
to O
independently O
produce O
all O
its O
weapons O
, O
from O
handguns O
to O
aircraft O
carriers O
, O
and O
it O
had O
a O
formidable O
research O
production O
capacity O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
every O
year O
they O
were O
able O
to O
produce O
1,580 B-CARDINAL
airplanes O
, O
744 B-CARDINAL
large O
- O
bore O
cannon O
, O
330 B-CARDINAL
tanks O
, O
, O
more O
than O
9,500 B-CARDINAL
vehicles O
, O
with O
a O
shipbuilding O
capacity O
of O
more O
than O
400,000 B-QUANTITY
tons I-QUANTITY
and O
a O
naval O
construction O
capacity O
of O
50,000 B-QUANTITY
tons I-QUANTITY
. O

Compared O
to O
this O
, O
at O
the O
time O
China B-GPE
could O
only O
produce O
rifles O
and O
small O
cannon O
; O
its O
capacity O
to O
produce O
heavy O
weapons O
was O
zero B-CARDINAL
. O

The O
only O
munitions O
plant O
capable O
of O
producing O
heavy O
weapons O
in O
the O
northeast O
was O
taken O
over O
by O
the O
Japanese B-NORP
. O

This O
means O
that O
China B-GPE
's O
consumption O
could O
not O
be O
met O
. O

Before O
the O
war O
, O
China B-GPE
's O
air O
force O
had O
some O
300 B-CARDINAL
airplanes O
; O
that O
may O
seem O
like O
quite O
a O
few O
, O
but O
they O
were O
all O
used O
up O
in O
just O
one B-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
and O
afterward O
we O
could O
only O
watch O
as O
Japanese B-NORP
aircrafts O
ruled O
the O
skies O
over O
China B-GPE
. O

On O
the O
surface O
, O
China B-GPE
is O
a O
large O
country O
, O
and O
Japan B-GPE
was O
the O
little O
guy O
taking O
on O
the O
giant O
. O

The O
most O
obvious O
part O
of O
China B-GPE
's O
being O
a O
big O
country O
was O
its O
population O
advantage O
. O

In O
fact O
Japan B-GPE
's O
total O
population O
after O
it O
had O
taken O
over O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
the O
Northeast O
, O
and O
Korea B-GPE
was O
not O
so O
very O
much O
smaller O
than O
China B-GPE
's O
, O
with O
about O
200 B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
people O
, O
at O

The O
important O
thing O
is O
that O
Japan B-GPE
had O
a O
complete O
reserve O

, O
with O
more O
than O
four B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
reserves O
who O
had O
received O
basic O

. O

China B-GPE
had O
basically O
no O
reserve O
military O
personnel O
, O
and O
the O
" O
national O
army O
" O
relied O
primarily O
on O
seizing O
able O

men O
to O
fill O
its O
ranks O
. O

These O
so O
- O
called O
able O

were O
sorely O
lacking O
in O
training O
; O
all O
they O
could O
do O
was O
learn O
to O
fight O
in O
battle O
. O

Therefore O
, O
in O
the O
field O

it O
often O
happened O
that O
a O
Japanese B-NORP

was O
able O
to O
defeat O
a O
whole O
division O
of O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
army O
; O
it O
was O
not O
just O
the O
difference O
in O
equipment O
: O
even O
more O
important O
were O
the O
differences O
in O
logistical O

The O

can O
be O

been O
the O

In O

except O
for O

at O

: O

Internal O

. O

Multidirectional O
movement O
during O
aerobic O
exercise O
requires O
extremely O
solid O
shoes O
. O

Each O
manufacturer O
provides O
different O
internal O
support O
characteristics O
. O

Some O
manufacturers O
use O
a O
molded O

, O
so O
that O
the O
foot O
can O
land O
just O
right O
inside O
the O
shoe O
; O
fibers O

the O

also O

In O

to O
increase O

flexibility O
, O
some O
manufacturers O
add O
a O
fiberboard O
padding O
only O
at O
the O
heel O
. O

External O
support O
. O

A O
firm O
, O
resistant O
heel O
support O
can O
greatly O
reduce O
heel O

. O

The O
wider O
part O
of O
the O
outsole O
is O
called O
the O
heel O
fixed O

It O
is O
made O

plastic O
and O
spreads O
all O
the O
way O
around O
the O
foot O
, O
attached O
to O
the O

Many O
shoes O

use O
a O

the O
fixed O
frame O
is O
a O
polymer O
part O
that O
is O
used O
as O
support O
and O
is O
distributed O
longitudinally O

the O
outside O

Shock O
absorption O
. O

Repeated O
impacts O
during O
aerobic O
exercise O
produces O
unique O
pressures O
that O
generally O
correspond O
to O
five B-CARDINAL
times O
your O
body O

. O

Therefore O
good O
shock O
- O
absorbing O
performance O
is O
essential O
. O

The O
midsole O
helps O
to O
disperse O
these O
impacts O
. O

A O
good O
midsole O
is O
made O
from O
extruded O
EVA O
or O
polyurethane O
. O

The O
various O
manufacturers O
have O
come O
up O
with O
various O
technologies O
to O
further O
increase O
the O
midsole O

shock O

If O
you O
are O
someone O
with O
insufficient O
downward O

or O
engage O

you O
may O

Elasticity O
. O

A O
shoe O
's O
elasticity O
is O
determined O
by O
how O
you O
feel O
when O
your O
feet O
move O
. O

Shoes O
with O
just O
a O

pad O
at O
the O

have O
better O
flexibility O
than O
athletic O
shoes O
using O

Athletic O
shoes O
with O
low O

can O
also O

Your O
feet O
may O
swell O
when O
they O
are O
under O
pressure O
and O
engaging O
in O
aerobic O
exercise O

The O
heat O
produced O
by O
intense O
exercise O
may O
cause O
the O
feet O
to O
swell O
by O
half B-CARDINAL
a O
size O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
when O
you O
buy O
shoes O
they O
should O
not O
be O
too O
tight O
; O
there O
should O
be O
a O
space O
as O
wide O
as O
a O
thumbnail O
between O
the O

the O

your O

ensure O
that O
your O
toes O
can O
move O
freely O
, O
and O
it O
should O
fit O
properly O
at O
the O

In O
addition O
, O
you O
should O
regularly O
measure O
the O
length O

your O

increasing O
age O

early O
years O
, O
I O
always O
believed O
that O
by O
relying O
on O
my O
smarts O
and O
effort O
I O
should O
eventually O
be O
able O
to O
live O
a O
pretty O
good O
life O
, O
but O
I O
never O
thought O
that O
when O
I O
was O
28 B-DATE
I O
'd O
be O
living O
in O
a O
fine O
home O
, O
be O
driving O
an O
Audi B-PRODUCT
, O
have O
so O
many O
investors O
in O
my O
company O
, O
and O
have O
more O
than O
a O
hundred B-CARDINAL
employees O
. O

Many O
people O
ask O
me O
, O
Why O
? O
Why O
are O
you O
able O
to O
make O
money O
? O

I O
ask O
myself O
the O
same O
question O
. O

I O
need O
to O
sum O
it O
all O
up O
, O
to O
find O
out O
the O
reasons O
I O
can O
make O
money O
, O
to O
find O
out O
which O
qualities O
determined O
today O
's O
achievements O
, O
to O
keep O
from O
slowly O
losing O
these O
qualities O
. O

Why O
am O
I O
able O
to O
make O
money O
? O

Making O
money O
means O
letting O
other O
people O
give O
you O
money O
; O
it O
's O
selling O
things O
. O

I O
made O
money O
because O
: O
I O
sold O
things O
to O
many O
people O
. O

Why O
are O
there O
so O
many O
people O
who O
buy O
my O
things O
? O

If O
I O
look O
at O
it O
from O
this O
angle O
, O
and O
briefly O
sum O
it O
all O
up O
, O
the O
following O
are O
the O
main O
reasons O
: O

1. B-CARDINAL
Good O
character O
: O

People O
's O
outlook O
is O
bright O
; O
if O
your O
everyday O
character O
is O
such O
that O
you O
are O
always O
thinking O
of O
other O
people O
, O
your O
things O
ca O
n't O
be O
too O
shoddy O
. O

A O
good O
person O
finds O
it O
easier O
to O
design O
good O
things O
, O
and O
good O
service O
models O
. O

I O
am O
a O
good O
person O
, O
I O
can O
say O
that O
with O
a O
clear O
conscience O
. O

To O
date O
, O
no O
one O
has O
been O
able O
to O
surpass O
the O
securities O
service O
model O
I O
designed O
four B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
. O

I O
think O
being O
a O
good O
person O
is O
the O
first O
reason O
I O
am O
able O
to O
make O
money O
. O

2. B-CARDINAL
Effort O
, O
progress O
, O
and O
constant O
study O
: O

This O
is O
the O
basic O
quality O
for O
success O
; O
there O
has O
never O
been O
any O
free O
lunch O
in O
the O
world O
, O
and O
since O
I O
graduated O
I've O
worked O
and O
studied O
14 B-QUANTITY
hours I-QUANTITY
every O
day O
. O

Pay O
attention O
to O
the O
concept O
of O
constant O
study O
; O
regardless O
of O
what O
you O
do O
, O
you O
need O
to O
give O
it O
careful O
consideration O
, O
and O
you O
'll O
gain O
an O
understanding O
of O
it O
; O
any O
time O
is O
study O
time O
. O

3. B-CARDINAL
Dare O
to O
act O
! O

Take O
no O
action O
, O
then O
there O
's O
no O
opportunity O
for O
sure O
! O

If O
you O
feel O
you O
can O
bear O
this O
risk O
, O
if O
you O
feel O
you O
can O
make O
do O
with O
the O
resources O
you O
have O
, O
then O
get O
cracking O
! O

4. B-CARDINAL
Luck O
: O
luck O
is O
also O
important O
. O

Actually O
, O
now O
you O
can O
get O
the O
opportunity O
that O
this O
Internet O
provides O
, O
and O
everybody O
's O
luck O
has O
gotten O
better O
. O

Do O
n't O
say O
that O
this O
completely O
new O
, O
revolutionary O
application O
, O
this O
huge O
market O
, O
which O
has O
grown O
so O
fast O
, O
is O
entirely O
taken O
up O
by O
big O
companies O
; O
do O
n't O
say O
the O
current O
situation O
is O
so O
disadvantageous O
. O

Five B-DATE
years I-DATE
from I-DATE
now I-DATE
, O
when O
we O
look O
back O
at O
2005 B-DATE
, O
we O
'll O
say O
that O
these O
were O
good O
times O
created O
by O
the O
Internet O
. O

5. B-CARDINAL
Business O
flair O
and O
IQ O
: O

My O
past O
business O
judgments O
demonstrate O
that O
I O
have O
a O
flair O
for O
business O
; O
I O
think O
my O
business O
sense O
is O
pretty O
sharp O
. O

6. B-CARDINAL
Systematic O
thinking O
enables O
you O
to O
grasp O
the O
key O
points O
of O
any O
mater O
. O

7. B-CARDINAL
Strong O
cooperative O
awareness O
: O
nobody O
can O
do O
everything O
. O

You O
need O
a O
team O
to O
make O
up O
for O
inadequacies O
in O
each O
person O
's O
ability O
and O
experience O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
I O
previously O
wrote O
a O
similar O
article O
, O
and O
everybody O
can O
search O
for O
it O
on O
Baidu O
or O
Google O
. O

Eventually O
I O
may O
specially O
rewrite O
it O
to O
describe O
in O
detail O
how O
to O
find O
a O
business O
that O
will O
make O
money O
. O

Everyone O
please O
note O
my O
blog O
on O
Donews O
http://blog.donews.com/pangshengdong O
. O

What O
I O
say O
is O
not O
necessarily O
right O
, O
but O
I O
am O
confident O
that O
if O
you O
read O
it O
carefully O
it O
should O
give O
you O
a O
start O
. O

Regarding O
everyone O
's O
suggestions O
: O

1. B-CARDINAL
What O
you O
pay O
out O
you O
will O
get O
back O
. O

Thinking O
more O
of O
other O
people O
, O
seeing O
things O
from O
their O
shoes O
: O
before O
you O
know O
it O
, O
we O
may O
also O
have O
the O
habits O
of O
good O
people O
, O
and O
this O
will O
raise O
our O
happiness O
index O
and O
our O
likelihood O
of O
succeeding O
. O

Most O
successful O
people O
are O
good O
people O
! O

2. B-CARDINAL
People O
are O
naturally O
lazy O
, O
but O
if O
we O
want O
to O
succeed O
, O
if O
we O
want O
to O
make O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
, O
we O
need O
to O
think O
positively O
and O
make O
a O
greater O
effort O
! O

Everybody O
has O
more O
or O
less O
the O
same O
IQ O
; O
what O
can O
you O
use O
to O
make O
money O
? O

Hah O
! O
Really O
make O
an O
effort O
! O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
make O
sure O
you O
study O
constantly O
! O

3. B-CARDINAL
Remember O
: O
things O
are O
possible O
only O
when O
you O
act O
! O

4. B-CARDINAL
Business O
opportunities O
can O
be O
analyzed O
; O
this O
requires O
a O
good O
model O
of O
thinking O
and O
adequate O
information O
. O

How O
to O
analyze O
? O

Eventually O
I O
will O
write O
an O
article O
explaining O
this O
in O
detail O
. O

5. B-CARDINAL
Pay O
attention O
to O
teamwork O
; O
one B-CARDINAL
person O
can O
not O
achieve O
great O
things O
. O

Always O
try O
to O
acquire O
friends O
who O
have O
abilities O
and O
experiences O
that O
complement O
yours O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
establish O
a O
successful O
business O
, O
it O
's O
extremely O
important O
to O
have O
several O
good O
partners O
. O

6. B-CARDINAL
Joining O
up O
with O
a O
good O
company O
is O
also O
a O
shortcut O
to O
getting O
rich O
; O
many O
new O

You O

7. B-CARDINAL
If O
you O
have O
a O
chance O
, O
interact O
with O
those O
who O
are O

the O
first B-ORDINAL
place O
, O
lower O
costs O
. O

Additionally O
, O
in O
the O
long O
term O
, O
RMB O
slowly O
edging O
up O
can O
encourage O
firms O
to O
use O
advanced O
international O
technology O
and O
resources O
. O

The O
government O
may O
support O
export O
, O
especially O
technological O
upgrade O
of O
exports O
, O
by O
such O
ways O
as O
increasing O
export O
rebates O
, O
adopting O
quicker O
depreciation O
, O
removing O
the O
super-national O
treatment O
to O
foreign O
investments O
. O

It O
can O
be O
expected O
that O
neither O
the O
appreciation O
of O
RMB O
nor O
the O
global O
economic O
recession O
will O
seriously O
impact O
Chinese B-NORP
export O
. O

It O
would O
be O
exaggerating O
to O
say O
China B-GPE
is O
70 B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
dependent O
on O
foreign O
trade O
. O

The O
statistics O
has O
underestimated O
China B-GPE
's O
Gross O
National O
Product O
-LRB- O
GNP O
-RRB- O
, O
especially O
that O
of O
the O
tertiary O
sector O
. O

Converting O
to O
US B-NORP
dollar O
at O
the O
exchange O
rate O
has O
also O
underestimated O
China B-GPE
's O
Gross O
Domestic O
Product O
-LRB- O
GDP O
-RRB- O
. O

As O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
half I-CARDINAL
of O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
foreign O
trade O
is O
processing O
trade O
, O
it O
would O
be O
overestimating O
the O
total O
foreign O
trade O
to O
count O
import O
and O
export O
repeatedly O
. O

The O
author O
estimates O
that O
our O
country O
actually O
might O
be O
40 B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
dependent O
on O
foreign O
trade O
. O

Therefore O
, O
there O
is O
no O
need O
to O
magnify O
China B-GPE
's O
dependence O
on O
export O
to O
the O
US B-GPE
. O

Export O
- O
oriented O
economic O
growth O
of O
China B-GPE
should O
be O
cooled O
down O
, O
while O
the O
role O
of O
domestic O
demand O
and O
import O
should O
be O
promoted O
. O

Our O
economic O
growth O
relies O
primarily O
on O
the O
domestic O
market O
and O
should O
be O
increasingly O
dependent O
on O
the O
domestic O
market O
. O

If O
factors O
such O
as O
the O
rapid O
development O
of O
the O
tertiary O
sector O
and O
the O
appreciation O
of O
RMB O
are O
taken O
into O
consideration O
, O
China B-GPE
's O
dependence O
on O
foreign O
trade O
can O
be O
controlled O
at O
around B-PERCENT
50 I-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
in O
the O
long O
run O
. O

Long O
- O
term O
export O
of O
Chinese B-NORP
products O
at O
low O
prices O
will O
lead O
to O
" O
impoverished O
wealth O
growth O
, O
" O
and O
we O
should O
specially O
understand O
the O
" O
wealth O
" O
as O
domestic O
environmental O
resources O
. O

Foreign O
- O
funded O
processing O
export O
consumes O
domestic O
electricity O
and O
water O
resources O
substantially O
. O

The O
environmental O
costs O
in O
our O
country O
account O
for O
approximately B-PERCENT
30 I-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
of O
product O
costs O
, O
but O
are O
not O
incorporated O
into O
product O
prices O
. O

And O
this O
is O
the O
primary O
reason O
why O
Chinese B-NORP
products O
are O
cheap O
. O

It O
is O
imperative O
to O
remove O
the O
environmental O
subsidies O
to O
domestic O
and O
foreign O
consumers O
, O
internalize O
external O
environmental O
costs O
of O
Chinese B-NORP
products O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
, O
and O
increase O
the O
prices O
of O
most O
products O
, O
including O
exports O
, O
in O
order O
to O
alleviate O
international O
trade O
frictions O
, O
reduce O
the O
pressure O
for O
RMB O
appreciation O
, O
and O
in O
particular O
change O
the O
prospect O
that O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
environmental O
resources O
will O
seriously O
deteriorate O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
population O
is O
huge O
and O
young O
, O
which O
enables O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
economy O
to O
enjoy O
the O
" O
population O
dividends O
. O
" O

However O
, O
the O
percentage O
of O
savings O
is O
astoundingly O
high O
, O
and O
according O
to O
the O
hypothesis O
of O
macroeconomic O
balance O
where O
savings O
equal O
investments O
, O
the O
huge O
investments O
have O
become O
the O
source O
of O
high O
- O
speed O
economic O
development O
. O

However O
, O
to O
depress O
the O
consumption O
rate O
to O
lower B-PERCENT
than I-PERCENT
40 I-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
will O
certainly O
lead O
to O
overproduction O
, O
and O
cheap O
goods O
will O
in O
turn O
impact O
the O
international O
market O
. O

If O
the O
US B-NORP
economic O
recession O
would O
indeed O
affect O
our O
export O
, O
it O
would O
not O
necessarily O
be O
a O
bad O
thing O
in O
the O
author O
's O
view O
. O

In O
a O
sense O
, O
domestic O
demand O
will O
not O
increase O
unless O
export O
decreases O
. O

Over O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
20 I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
the O
world O
has O
experienced O
many O

. O

The O
US B-GPE
also O
suffered O

in O
2001 B-DATE

China B-GPE
is O
the O
only O
one O
to O
realize O
economic O

for O
the O
largest O
population O
in O
the O
history O
. O

Whenever O
there O
is O
an O
international O
economic O
recession O
, O
China B-GPE
would O
actively O
expand O
domestic O
demand O
to O
create O

for O
different O
countries O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
China B-GPE
has O
long O
been O
a O
responsible O
big O
nation O
, O
playing O
a O

Long O

China B-GPE

led O
to O
significant O

such O

areas O
; O
the O
economy O
has O
become O
dependent O
on O
the O

to O
some O

due O
to O

; O
and O

By O
now O
, O
high O

the O

entered O

the O

leading O
to O
the O

predicted O
by O

This O
is O
also O
why O
China B-GPE
is O
not O
afraid O
of O
a O
global O
economic O
crisis O
and O
capable O
of O
digesting O
it O
. O

However O
, O
after O

China B-GPE
will O
be O
facing O
the O

which O
is O

an O

As O

will O
be O
leading O

We O

The O

will O
be O

through O

the O

It O
wo O

do O
to O
rely O
solely O
on O
the O

To O

Various O

From O

the O

imposes O

Whether O

can O
be O

the O

The B-DATE

I O
took O
the O
subway O
to O
meet O
someone O
at O
the O
railway O
station O
today B-DATE
and O
found O
a O
red O
header O
document O
posted O
everywhere O
inside O
the O
subway O
station O
. O

A O
closer O
look O
told O
me O
it O
was O
the O
notice O
about O
public O
transportation O
price O
adjustment O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
. O

I O
did O
n't O
care O
about O
the O
details O
because O
the O
news O
had O
been O
heard O
for O
a O
while O
. O

What O
attracted O
me O
was O
the O
six B-CARDINAL
red O
cachets O
below O

, O
Traffic B-ORG
Commission I-ORG
and O
Transportation B-ORG
Administrative I-ORG
Bureau I-ORG
. O

I O
know O
roughly O
the O
reason O
why O
the O
cachets O
of O
the O
former O
four B-CARDINAL
organizations O
are O
required O
. O

Development B-ORG
and I-ORG
Reform I-ORG
Commission I-ORG
is O
the O
organization O
in O
charge O
of O
prices O
. O

Education B-ORG
Commission I-ORG
and O
Social B-ORG
Security I-ORG
Bureau I-ORG
correspond O
to O
the O
population O
on O
whom O
this O
policy O
may O
have O
relatively O
greater O
impact O
on O
. O

Financial B-ORG
Bureau I-ORG
is O
the O
organization O
providing O
the O
fund O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
kind O
of O
organizations O
Traffic B-ORG
Commission I-ORG
and O
Transportation B-ORG
Administrative I-ORG
Bureau I-ORG
are O
. O

I O
even O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
these O
two B-CARDINAL
organizations O
are O
not O
a O
single O
organization O
- O
Judging O
from O
the O
name O
, O
it O
seems O
that O
Transportation B-ORG
Administrative I-ORG
Bureau I-ORG
could O
be O
a O
division O
of O
Traffic B-ORG
Commission I-ORG
definitely O
. O

However O
, O
now O
that O
the O
subway O
does O
have O
something O
to O
do O
with O
traffic O
and O
transportation O
, O
there O
is O
nothing O
strange O
with O
the O
appearance O
of O
the O
cachets O
of O
these O
two B-CARDINAL
departments O
. O

Then O
, O
what O
surprised O
me O
? O

When O
I O
saw O
these O
six B-CARDINAL
cachets O
, O
my O
first B-ORDINAL
reaction O
is O
that O
it O
is O
absolutely O
hopeless O
to O
rely O
on O
the O
government O
itself O
to O
control O
institutional O
thickening O
. O

There O
must O
be O
a O
reason O
for O
a O
bloated O
government O
. O

Look O
, O
I O
found O
out O
the O
reason O
for O
these O
six B-CARDINAL
cachets O
with O
the O
slightest O
effort O
. O

However O
, O
I O
am O
totally O
an O
outlier O
. O

It O
is O
much O
easier O
for O
these O
governmental O
departments O
to O
find O
an O
excuse O
for O
their O
existence O
, O
is O
n't O
it O
? O

And O
their O
excuses O
are O
always O
affirmative O
, O
and O
always O
for O
the O
interests O
of O
the O
common O
people O
. O

The O
existence O
of O
governmental O
departments O
is O
different O
from O
the O
existence O
of O
private O
institutions O
. O

Private O
institutions O
spend O
their O
own O
money O
, O
and O
too O
much O
expansion O
will O
make O
them O
suffer O
loss O
. O

What O
governmental O
departments O
spend O
is O
taxpayers O
' O
money O
. O

Regardless O
how O
much O
is O
spent O
, O
as O
long O
as O
the O
amount O
is O
not O
ridiculously O
large O
, O
they O
will O
never O
face O
the O
risk O
of O
loss O
and O
closing O
down O

They O
themselves O
can O
find O
excuses O
for O
thickening O
without O
worrying O
about O
the O
problem O
of O
money O
. O

What O
kind O
of O
excuses O
governmental O
institutions O
have O
will O
prevent O
thickening O
? O

I O
can O
hardly O
figure O
it O
out O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
any O
objections O
against O
this O
downward O
adjustment O
of O
public O
transportation O
prices O
, O
but O
those O
six B-CARDINAL
cachets O
are O
really O
too O
striking O
. O

still O
a O
well O
- O
behaved O
Chinese O
citizen O
at O
the O
moment O
of O
his O
death O
. O

[Jerry0803] O
I O
express O
my O
sorrow O
for O
his O
death O
and O
my O
sincere O
condolence O
to O
his O
family O
: O
please O
accept O
my O
sincere O
condolences O
. O

[Jerry0803] O
What O
I O
want O
to O
say O
now O
is O
the O
significance O
and O
value O
of O
Sun O
Ming O
's O
death O
. O

[Jerry0803] O
Before O
we O
figure O
out O
this O
question O
, O
we O
must O
clarify O
whether O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
Iraqi O
War O
is O
righteous O
or O
not O
? O

[Jerry0803] O
If O
it O
is O
righteous O
, O
then O
the O
death O
of O
Sun O
Ming O
is O
significant O
, O
no O
matter O
to O
the O
United O
States O
, O
to O
China O
and O
even O
to O
the O
people O
all O
over O
the O
world O
. O

[Jerry0803] O
He O
then O
is O
an O
internationalist O
warrior O
like O
Bethune O
who O
should O
be O
remembered O
by O
the O
entire O
human O
kind O
. O

[Jerry0803] O
On O
the O
contrary O
, O
if O
the O
Iraqi O
War O
is O
not O
righteous O
, O
then O
the O
death O
of O
Sun O
Ming O
is O
not O
honorable O
at O
all O
. O

It O
is O
even O
not O
worthwhile O
or O
regrettable O
. O

[Jerry0803] O
As O
far O
as O
the O
International O
Law O
is O
concerned O
, O
any O
war O
unauthorized O
by O
the O
United O
Nations O
is O
disputable O
in O
terms O
of O
its O
righteousness O
. O

The O
honorable O
title O
is O
not O
widely O
recognized O
for O
those O
who O
fall O
in O
the O
war O
. O

[Jerry0803] O
Simply O
put O
, O
there O
would O
be O
two O
possibilities O
if O
it O
is O
included O
in O
the O
textbooks O
. O

[Jerry0803] O
One O
is O
the O
country O
waging O
the O
war O
would O
depict O
him O
as O
a O
hero O
for O
later O
generations O
to O
revere O
; O
The O
other O
is O
the O
country O
forced O
into O
war O
would O
regard O
him O
as O
a O
negative O
character O
for O
later O
generations O
to O
revile O
. O

[Jerry0803] O
It O
is O
well O
known O
there O
are O
two O
the O
Iraqi O
wars O
. O

One O
is O
the O
1991 O
Iraqi O
War O
, O
[Jerry0803] O
which O
was O
sanctioned O
by O
the O
United O
Nations O
and O
represented O
the O
punishment O
by O
righteous O
forces O
around O
the O
world O
on O
Iraqi O
invasion O
into O
the O
sovereign O
country O
Kuwait O
. O

[Jerry0803] O
Without O
doubt O
, O
that O
Iraqi O
War O
was O
righteous O
in O
nature O
. O

[Jerry0803] O
Obviously O
, O
any O
soldier O
on O
the O
righteous O
side O
who O
sacrificed O
his O
life O
in O
this O
war O
, O
their O
death O
was O
meaningful O
to O
the O
world O
. O

[Jerry0803] O
However O
, O
the O
second O
Iraqi O
War O
, O
the O
Iraqi O
War O
still O
going O
on O
, O
is O
done O
by O
the O
United O
States O
leaving O
the O
United O
Nations O
aside O
. O

[Jerry0803] O
This O
is O
the O
reason O
why O
the O
war O
can O
not O
be O
righteous O
in O
nature O
, O
no O
matter O
which O
countries O
or O
people O
believe O
Iraq O
should O
be O
beaten O
up O
, O
[Jerry0803] O
because O
emotions O
can O
not O
represent O
the O
law O
. O

[Jerry0803] O
This O
is O
just O
like O
an O
unpardonably O
wicked O
villain O
. O

No O
one O
group O
or O
individual O
has O
the O
right O
to O
sentence O
him O
to O
death O
except O
the O
judge O
. O

[Jerry0803] O
If O
anyone O
has O
an O
itch O
and O
decides O
for O
the O
judge O
, O
the O
guy O
would O
be O
a O
manslaughter O
. O

[Jerry0803] O
I O
believe O
those O
who O
love O
" O
America O
" O
will O
not O
call O
me O
a O
sucker O
for O
comparing O
them O
this O
way O
. O

[Jerry0803] O
The O
United O
States O
is O
a O
very O
charming O
country O
. O

When O
a O
Chinese O
citizen O
devoted O
his O
life O
to O
American O
interests O
, O
it O
gave O
him O
the O
treatment O
of O
a O
US O
citizen O
generously O
. O

[Jerry0803] O
Sun O
Ming O
, O
whose O
biggest O
wish O
had O
been O
becoming O
a O
US O
citizen O
, O
can O
now O
close O
his O
eyes O
if O
he O
is O
still O
conscious O
in O
grave O
. O

[Jerry0803] O
But O
I O
have O
some O
other O
different O
thoughts O
. O

Now O
that O
the O
dead O
is O
gone O
, O
we O
should O
care O
more O
about O
the O
alive O
. O

[Jerry0803] O
For O
example O
should O
n't O
the O
US O
government O
do O
something O
for O
the O
bereaved O
families O
of O
" O
martyr O
" O
Sun O
Ming O
. O

[Jerry0803] O
Simply O
put O
, O
anyway O
it O
has O
to O
give O
a O
token O
of O
affection O
, O
right O
? O

[Jerry0803] O
It O
can O
just O
send O
them O
away O
with O
a O
" O
Certificate O
of O
Martyr O
" O
and O
some O
consolation O
money O
. O

[Jerry0803] O
Especially O
the O
words O
of O
Sun O
Ming O
's O
father O
" O
I O
hope O
the O
war O
ends O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
, O
I O
hope O
the O
Bush O
administration O
ensures O
the O
safety O
of O
American O
soldiers O
. O

Do O
n't O
hurt O
any O
families O
any O
more O
. O
" O

[Jerry0803] O
Should O
n't O
the O
US O
government O
consider O
it O
seriously O
? O

[Jerry0803] O
Life O
is O
precious O
, O
and O
the O
United O
States O
is O
a O
nation O
that O
loves O
life O
and O
cherishes O
life O
. O

[Jerry0803] O
If O
it O
yells O
nothing O
is O
more O
valuable O
than O
life O
on O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
and O
it O
sends O
US O
soldiers O
across O
the O
world O
to O
bleed O
and O
sacrifice O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
would O
n't O
the O
two O
be O
self O
- O
contradictory O
? O

[Jerry0803] O
How O
can O
it O
say O
it O
loves O
life O
and O
cherishes O
life O
? O

[Jerry0803] O
The O
US O
government O
says O
they O
have O
sent O
troops O
to O
Iraq O
to O
free O
the O
Iraqi O
people O
. O

[Jerry0803] O
With O
mountains O
and O
waters O
between O
us O
, O
I O
do O
not O
know O
the O
attitude O
of O
the O
Iraqi O
people O
and O
thus O
can O
not O
judge O
groundlessly O
. O

[Jerry0803] O
But O
subconsciously O
I O
have O
a O
feeling O
that O
it O
is O
nothing O
more O
than O
a O
fight O
between O
two O
gangster O
heads O
for O
turfs O
. O

[Jerry0803] O
The O
Bush O
administration O
is O
the O
Water O
Margin O
, O
which O
holds O
up O
the O
flag O
of O
" O
acting O
for O
the O

" O
without O

authorization O
of O

, O
destructing O
Zhujia O
Village O

and O
eliminating O
Zengtou O

, O
and O
it O
is O
hard O
to O
say O
if O
it O
is O
attacking O
Daming O
City O
the O
day O
after O
. O

[Jerry0803] O
The O
Saddam O
regime O
are O
the O
likes O
of O
Tian O
Hu O
and O
Wang O
Qing O
. O

The O
public O
resentment O
can O
not O
be O
dispelled O
if O
they O
are O
not O
killed O
. O

[Jerry0803] O
Is O
n't O
the O
death O
of O
Sun O
Ming O
the O
same O
as O
the O
deaths O
of O
Wen O
Zhongrong O
and O
Cui O
Ye O
. O

[Jerry0803] O
Tang O
Bin O
, O
Wei O
Zhongrong O
and O
Cui O
Ye O
were O
all O
former O
subordinates O
to O
Tian O
Hu O
. O

He O
wailed O
loudly O
as O
they O
were O
companions O
, O
[Jerry0803] O
while O
Song O
Jiang O
was O
merely O
miserable O
. O

[Jerry0803] O
On O
the O
contrary O
, O
let O
's O
see O
what O
Song O
Jiang O
looked O
like O
when O
his O
brothers O
died O
. O

[Jerry0803] O
In O
Chapter O
112 O
of O
Water O

, O
it O
says O
: O
" O

Hearing O
three O

were O
lost O
, O
Song O
Jiang O
let O
out O
a O
cry O
and O
collapsed O
onto O
the O
ground O

It O

This O
article O
was O
originally O
written O
in O
response O
to O
a O
Muslim B-NORP
Club O
question O
; O
if O
its O
tone O
is O
excessive O
in O
spots O
, O
please O
excuse O
. O

What O
you O
said O
is O
right O
: O
many O
of O
these O
are O
individual O
clashes O
. O

It O
is O
very O
difficult O
for O
one B-CARDINAL
person O
's O
ethnic O
or O
religious O
status O
to O
shape O
a O
person O
's O
behavior O
. O

If O
one B-CARDINAL
individual O
in O
an O
ethnic O
group O
or O
religion O
does O
something O
bad O
, O
you O
can O
only O
say O
that O
that O
person O
's O
character O
has O
an O
essentially O
evil O
side O
to O
it O
. O

If O
he O
does O
good O
, O
then O
certainly O
a O
large O
part O
of O
his O
character O
is O
good O
. O

If O
we O
reverse O
this O
logic O
, O
no O
religion O
or O
ethnic O
group O
in O
the O
world O
is O
without O
blame O
. O

The O
Han B-NORP
have O
a O
longer O
history O
than O
the O
Hui B-NORP
and O
a O
greater O
population O
; O
who O
knows O
how O
many O
clashes O
there O
have O
been O
historically O
with O
the O
peripheral O
minorities O
? O

So O
can O
we O
say O
that O
the O
Han B-NORP
are O
such O
and O
such O
? O

With O
regard O
to O
certain O
clashes O
involving O
local O
ethnic O
groups O
or O
territories O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
say O
anything O
about O
whether O
that O
ethnic O
group O
is O
bad O
or O
good O
; O
rather O
it O
's O
a O
tragedy O
brought O
on O
by O
a O
sort O
of O
" O
security O
crisis O
" O
and O
" O
misinterpreted O
information O
. O
" O

Most O
of O
all O
, O
it O
's O
basically O
a O
matter O
of O
the O
political O
system O
and O
of O
trust O

Regardless O
of O
whether O
it O

the O
Han B-NORP
or O
the O
Hui B-NORP
, O
when O
friction O
first B-ORDINAL
crops O
up O
, O
their O
lack O
of O
faith O
in O
the O
government O
and O
law O
-LRB- O
this O
is O
a O
characteristic O
of O
many O
autarchies O
-RRB- O
makes O
people O
believe O
that O
the O
government O
can O
not O
fairly O
and O
effectively O
handle O
the O
situation O
. O

This O
gives O
both O
sides O
the O
illusion O
they O
're O
in O
a O
state O
of O
anarchy O
. O

More O
often O
than O
not O
they O
resort O
to O
using O
the O
strength O
of O
their O
own O
villages O
or O
ethnic O
group O
to O
protect O
their O
security O
. O

This O
" O
civic O
conflict O
" O
gets O
turned O
into O
an O
" O
ethnic O
conflict O
. O
" O

And O
when O
one O
side O
mobilizes O
its O
own O
village O
to O
respond O
to O
the O
security O
threat O
-LRB- O
not O
just O
physical O
safety O
but O
also O
moral O
safety O
- O
protecting O
their O
own O
way O
of O
life O
-RRB- O
that O
they O
see O
as O
coming O
from O
another O
village O
, O
the O
other O
side O
obviously O
will O
not O
stand O
idly O
by O
but O
will O
also O
mobilize O
and O
prepare O
. O

In O
this O
way O
the O
impressions O
of O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
group O
will O
be O
validated O
, O
and O
so O
on O
, O
with O
both O
sides O
falling O
into O
the O
vicious O
cycle O
of O
" O
security O
crisis O
" O
just O
as O
when O
a O
war O
breaks O
out O
in O
international O
politics O
; O
the O
clash O
is O
unavoidable O
. O

Add O
to O
this O
the O
fact O
that O
both O
sides O
include O
some O
people O
who O
, O
because O
they O
have O
been O
regularly O
bullied O
, O
or O
the O
village O
headman O
or O
sheikh O
wants O
to O
use O
this O
as O
an O
opportunity O
to O
gain O
some O
political O
advantage O
and O
increase O
his O
own O
influence O
, O
seizing O
the O
chance O
to O
fan O
the O
flames O
and O
inciting O
people O
to O
fight O
. O

Some O
governments O
-LRB- B-ORG
the I-ORG
Manchu I-ORG
Qing I-ORG
-RRB- I-ORG
even O
adopted O
a O
policy O
of O
" O
using O
the O
barbarians O
to O
control O
the O
barbarians O
, O
" O
stirring O
up O
conflict O
, O
using O
the O
Hui B-NORP
to O
control O
the O
Han B-NORP
and O
the O
Han B-NORP
to O
control O
the O
Hui B-NORP
. O

There O
are O
some O
people O
who O
make O
an O
uproar O
over O
Hui B-NORP
- O
Han B-NORP
clashes O
who O
take O
a O
one B-CARDINAL
- O
sided O
view O
; O
they O
see O
only O
the O
clash O
, O
but O
they O
overlook O
how O
many O
times O
these O
types O
of O
clashes O
have O
been O
settled O
, O
how O
many O
times O
there O
has O
been O
cooperation O
between O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
groups O
. O

Some O
people O
claim O
to O
be O
involved O
in O
academic O
research O
, O
then O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
thing O
that O
should O
be O
done O
is O
to O
list O
all O
the O
interactions O
between O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
groups O
in O
history O
and O
in O
the O
present O
: O
clashes O
, O
peaceful O
coexistence O
, O
cooperation O
. O

In O
this O
way O
you O
get O
at B-CARDINAL
least I-CARDINAL
three I-CARDINAL
variables O
, O
and O
only O
then O
can O
you O
analyze O
the O
causal O
relationship O
. O

Some O
people O
's O
resulting O
variables O
do O
not O
change O
, O
or O
there O
is O
only O
one B-CARDINAL
value O
: O
clashes O
. O

What O
kind O
of O
" O
scientific O
research O
" O
result O
can O
people O
like O
this O
achieve O
? O

Changes O
in O
variables O
should O
also O
be O
considered O
in O
terms O
of O
consideration O
. O

You O
look O
at O
the O
many O
policies O
of O
minority O
consideration O
, O
but O
you O
should O
also O
look O
at O
how O
, O
in O
a O
majority O
- O
Han B-NORP
society O
, O
in O
a O
society O
that O
stresses O
uniformity O
and O
looks O
down O
on O
individuality O
, O
there O
are O
just O
as O
many O
mechanisms O
and O
opportunities O
for O
discrimination O
against O
minorities O
, O
if O
not O
more O
. O

Did O
you O
know O
that O
in O
interviews O
some O
people O
are O
rejected O
just O
because O
they O
have O
a O
northwest O
accent O
? O

Do O
you O
know O
how O
distressed O
Muslims B-NORP
are O
in O
a O
unit O
or O
company O
where O
there O
is O
no O
halal O
canteen O
? O

Have O
you O
ever O
heard O
a O
Mongol B-NORP
father O
cry O
because O
his O
son O
has O
to O
start O
studying O
Chinese B-NORP
in O
first B-ORDINAL
grade O
? O

Do O
you O
understand O
how O
development O
of O
the O
West O
has O
plundered O
so O
many O
resources O
and O
left O
the O
local O
minorities O
just O
as O
needy O
as O
they O
ever O
were O
? O

This O
lack O
of O
consideration O
is O
most O
often O
not O
obvious O
, O
but O
it O
is O
everywhere O
. O

Of O
course O
these O
forms O
of O
discrimination O
very O
seldom O
come O
from O
the O
whole O
" O
Han B-NORP
race O
" O
as O
an O
abstract O
; O
most O
often O
they O
come O
from O
the O
system O
- O
a O
form O
of O
ethnic O
rule O
that O
combines O
centralized O
authority O
+ O
representatives O
of O
local O
minorities O
. O

It O
can O
not O
be O
denied O
; O
minorities O
have O
many O
faults O
as O
well O
. O

However O
, O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
the O
people O
at O
the O
lower O
levels O
of O
society O
are O
blameless O
, O
just O
as O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
our O
Han B-NORP
compatriots O
at O
the O
lower O
levels O
of O
society O
are O
blameless O
. O

Those O
who O
should O
be O
blamed O
are O
the O
cadres O
in O
the O
upper O
echelons O
of O
the O
Party B-ORG
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
ethnic O
cadres O
and O
the O
influential O
capitalists O
in O
league O
with O
them O
. O

In O
the O
past O
when O
the O
local O
tyrants O
and O
despots O
among O
the O
minorities O
were O
overthrown O
, O
the O
masses O
of O
minorities O
and O
the O
Han B-NORP
were O
equally O
happy O
. O

But O
today O
they O
find O
that O
the O
cadres O
and O
capitalists O
from O
those B-DATE
years I-DATE
are O
now O
standing O
together O
, O
and O
the O
Han B-NORP
people O
of O
the O
same O
class O
from O
those B-DATE
years I-DATE
are O
beginning O
to O
suppress O
them O
. O

Of O
course O
some O
people O
say O
that O
the B-ORG
Communist I-ORG
Party I-ORG
and O
most O
Han B-NORP
cadres O
have O
made O
many O
contributions O
to O
the O
construction O
of O
border O
and O
minority O
areas O
, O
and O
have O
sacrificed O
so O
much O
. O

Right O
, O
the O
minorities O
should O
be O
grateful O
and O
remember O
the O
contributions O
of O
the O
Han B-NORP
cadres O
, O
and O
this O
proves O
that O
any O
two B-CARDINAL
ethnic O
groups O
can O
live O
peacefully O
together O
. O

However O
, O
it O
can O
also O
be O
said O
that O
the O
Party B-ORG
and O
the O
country O
have O
a O
duty O
to O
provide O
basic O
infrastructure O
and O
improve O
economic O
development O
, O

because O
since O
you O
govern O
this O
land O
, O
and O
you O
collect O
taxes O
, O
do O
you O
really O
want O
to O
wipe O
your O
ass O
and O
leave O
? O

More O
importantly O
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
" O
preferential O
policy O
" O
can O
only O
be O
given O
by O
a O
powerful O
ethnic O
group O
or O
force O
. O

This O
should O
be O
common O
knowledge O
- O
the O
people O
who O
can O
give O
are O
always O
higher O
- O
ups O
. O

And O
the O
weaker O
ethnic O
groups O
can O
only O
accept O
it O
passively O
. O

But O
let O
's O
not O
mention O
on O
what O
basis O
the B-ORG
Communist I-ORG
Party I-ORG
divided O
55 B-CARDINAL
ethnic O
groups O
into O
" O
minorities O
" O
!!?? O

The O
essence O
of O
our O
Party B-ORG
's O
ethnic O
preferential O
policies O
is O
to O
permanently O
institute O
this O
strong O
- O
weak O
relationship O
between O
the O
Han B-NORP
race O
and O
its O
fraternal O
ethnic O
groups O
-LRB- O
the O
relationship O
between O
the O
center O
and O
the O
fringe O
, O
the O
governing O
and O
the O
governed O
. O

Let O
the O
Han B-NORP
race O
-LRB- O
mainly O
meaning O
the O
inner O
bureaucracy O
-RRB- O
act O
like O
the O
emperor O
, O
doling O
out O
to O
the O
" O
minority O
" O
here O
and O
there O
. O

And O
the O
" O
minorities O
" O
can O
only O
feel O
deeply O
grateful O
, O
how O
will O
they O
dare O
discuss O
equality O
!! O

People O
who O
are O
given O
consideration O
are O
in O
mainstream O
eyes O
the O
weak O
; O
as O
time O
goes O
by O
, O
the O
" O
minorities O
" O
who O
are O
given O
consideration O
also O
get O
accustomed O
to O
this O
arrangement O
and O
believe O
that O
they O
are O
the O
weak O
ones O
and O
should O
be O
dominated O
, O
as O
if O
they O
were O
inferior O
!!!! O

Do O
n't O
you O
see O
it O
, O

but O
whenever O
there O
is O
some O
event O
like O
National B-EVENT
Day I-EVENT
or O
May B-EVENT
First I-EVENT
, O
all O
the O
ethnic O
groups O
get O
together O
in O
Tiananmen B-FAC
Square I-FAC
, O
and O
people O
dress O
as O
" O
minorities O
, O
" O
wear O
their O
costumes O
, O
their O
traditional O
folk O
dress O
, O
even O
if O
they O
have O
never O
worn O
such O
outfits O
in O
their O
daily O
lives O
. O

While O
the O
Han B-NORP
leaders O
and O
representatives O
are O
wearing O
Western O
suits O
and O
leather O
shoes O
. O

What O
does O
this O
explain O
? O

It O
perfectly O
reflects O
this O
strong O
- O
weak O
relationship O
: O
the O
Han B-NORP
are O
contemporary O
, O
and O
the O
minorities O
are O
backward O
, O
stuck O
in O
the O
past O
and O
abnormal O
!!!! O

This O
is O
the O
price O
to O
pay O
for O
being O
considered O
!!! O

What O
need O
is O
even O
there O
to O
talk O
of O
abuse O
!!?? O

All O
ethnic O
groups O
have O
been O
enslaved O
. O

What O
else O
is O
there O
? O

The O
result O
of O
receiving O
consideration O
is O
the O
degeneration O
of O
these O
ethnic O
groups O
, O
with O
no O
hope O
of O
progress O
. O

Do O
n't O
we O
really O
know O
where O
those O
people O
got O
their O
sour O
grapes O
? O

The O
lifelong O
term O
system O
of O
leading O
cadres O
is O
not O
good O
, O
and O
it O
has O
long O
been O
criticized O
by O
intellectuals O
. O

The O
so O
- O
called O
idea O
about O
the O
lifelong O
term O
system O
of O
leading O
cadres O
means O
when O
the O
end O
of O
a O
term O
of O
office O
comes O
, O
or O
when O
a O
given O
age O
is O
reached O
, O
they O
should O
step O
down O
. O

This O
point O
has O
already O
been O
put O
into O
practice O
, O
though O
not O
fully O
implemented O
in O
reality O
. O

Some O
very O
bad O
practices O
have O
n't O
been O
abolished O
yet O
: O
i.e. O
the O
lifelong O
remuneration O
system O
for O
leading O
cadres O
. O

What O
is O
known O
as O
the O
lifelong O
remuneration O
system O
for O
leading O
cadres O
means O
that O
when O
a O
leading O
cadre O
steps O
down O
from O
his O
senior O
position O
, O
he O
still O
retains O
his O
level O
of O
remuneration O
such O
as O
" O
division O
leader O
level O
. O
" O

Even O
worse O
is O
that O
as O
soon O
as O
you O
become O
a O
leading O
cadre O
, O
you O
are O
then O
a O
leader O
for O
life O
, O
with O
no O
need O
to O
worry O
about O
any O
problems O
of O
being O
laid O
off O
. O

If O
your O
department O
disappears O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
matter O
, O
either O
. O

A O
sinecure O
can O
always O
be O
arranged O
for O
you O
at O
a O
salary O
high O
enough O
for O
you O
to O
maintain O
your O
integrity O
, O
like O
going O
to O
the O
CPPCC B-ORG
to O
serve O
as O
some O
deputy O
chairperson O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
break O
the O
law O
, O
you O
will O
only O
move O
upwards O
, O
you O
wo O
n't O
slip O
downwards O
. O

I O
think O
we O
should O
completely O
abolish O
the O
life O
- O
long O
term O
system O
of O
leading O
cadres O
. O

For O
example O
, O
if O
a O
person O
is O
mayor O
, O
when O
he O
steps O
down O
at O
the O
end O
of O
his O
term O
, O
he O
could O
no O
longer O
be O
given O
mayor O
level O
remuneration O
. O

If O
he O
is O
not O
able O
enough O
and O
becomes O
a O
division O
leader O
, O
then O
he O
should O
be O
remunerated O
at O
the O
division O
leader O
level O
. O

If O
he O
's O
even O
more O
incompetent O
and O
has O
been O
laid O
off O
, O
then O
he O
should O
be O
like O
a O
laid O
- O
off O
factory O
worker O
and O
collect O
unemployment O
benefits O
. O

He O
should O
n't O
go O
to O
the O
mayor O
, O
but O
to O
the O
markets O
. O

The O
" O
iron O
rice O
bowl O
" O
was O
broken O
for O
workers O
decades O
ago O
. O

There O
is O
no O
reason O
why O
leading O
cadres O
should O
still O
be O
holding O
onto O
a O
golden O
rice O
bowl O
. O

I O
've O
had O
a O
look O
at O
Director B-PERSON
Ba I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
biography O
and O
was O
surprised O
to O
find O
that O
Director B-PERSON
Ba I-PERSON
had O
been O
chairman O
of O
the B-ORG
Writers I-ORG
' I-ORG
Association I-ORG
since B-DATE
1983 I-DATE
right O
up O
until O
he O
passed O
away O
. O

I O
think O
that O
the B-ORG
Writers I-ORG
' I-ORG
Association I-ORG
is O
n't O
any O
kind O
of O
important O
department O
affecting O
the O
national O
economy O
and O
people O
's O
livelihood O
and O
whether O
it O
was O
the O
lifelong O
term O
system O
would O
draw O
nobody O
's O
attention O
. O

But O
Director B-PERSON
Ba I-PERSON
, O
as O
an O
intellectual O
who O
always O
spoke O
the O
truth O
and O
stood O
up O
for O
what O
was O
right O
, O
should O
have O
known O
that O
the O
lifelong O
term O
system O
of O
leaders O
is O
not O
good O
, O
and O
should O
have O
been O
opposed O
. O

Moreover O
, O
when O
Director B-PERSON
Ba I-PERSON
became O
chairman O
of O
the B-ORG
Writers I-ORG
' I-ORG
Association I-ORG
, O
he O
was O
already O
quite O
elderly O
. O

Doing O
it O
for O
one B-CARDINAL
or O
two B-CARDINAL
terms O
, O
he O
'd O
be O
+really O
senile O
however O
you O
look O
at O
it O
. O

He O
had O
his O
own O
health O
problems O
. O

How O
could O
he O
have O
that O
much O
energy O
to O
manage O
the O
affairs O
of O
the B-ORG
Writers I-ORG
' I-ORG
Association I-ORG
? O

It O
would O
have O
been O
better O
to O
get O
off O
the O
pot O

In O
fact O
, O
in O
his O
last B-ORDINAL

, O
Director B-PERSON

lay O

unable O
even O

alive O

Even O
if O

the O

that O

In O
the O

someone O

But O
this O

had O
no O

I O
guess O
the O
biggest O
reason O
maybe O
is O
because O
of O
Director B-PERSON

great O

, O
everyone O

The O
current O
situation O
of O
economic O
development O
in O
our O
country O
makes O
us O
both O
happy O
and O

. O

We O
are O
happy O
because O
we O
have O
a O
government O
and O
the O
people O
who O
are O
greatly O
interested O
in O

and O
developing O

. O

And O
we O
are O
worried O
because O
the O
global O
division O
of O

has O
led O
to O
an O
abnormal O

[buabua] O
To O
sum O

, O
China O

has O

today O
I O
would O

four O
points O

[buabua] O
I. O
the O
large O

[buabua] O
The O
first O
feature O
is O
certainly O
the O
high O

growth O
and O
large O

scale O
. O

[buabua] O
Over O
these O
years O
, O
our O
country O
has O
been O
a O
country O
with O
unusually O
high O
economic O

in O
the O

, O
and O
its O
achievements O
in O

often O
surprise O
the O

the O

the O

in O
today O

news O
report O
can O
be O
called O
the O

. O

[buabua] O
Of O
course O
, O
the O
high O
economic O
growth O
of O
our O
country O
is O
mainly O
driven O
by O
high O
investment O
. O

[buabua] O
According O

the O

, O
I O
said O
to O
them O
, O
which O
country O
in O
the O
world O
has O
such O
a O
large O
construction O
scale O
at O
present O
? O

[buabua] O
With O
regard O
to O
the O
issue O
of O
the O
RMB O
exchange O
rate O
, O
to O
calculate O
based O
on O
PPP O
Standards O
, O
the O
total O
economic O
value O
and O
the O
construction O
scale O
of O
China O
should O
be O
absolutely O
far O
more O
than O
this O
. O

[buabua] O
In O
the O
whole O
year O
of O
2006 O
, O
the O
total O
investment O
in O
fixed O
assets O
of O
our O
country O
may O
reach O
10 O
trillion O
yuan O
, O
increasing O
by O
approximately O
30 O
% O
compared O
with O
the O
previous O
year O
. O

[buabua] O
Scenes O
of O
booming O
construction O
can O
be O
seen O
everywhere O
in O
our O
country O
at O
present O
. O

This O
is O
something O
to O
be O
happy O
about O
. O

[buabua] O
For O
example O
, O
Beijing O
plans O
to O
increase O
the O
length O
of O
its O
subway O
to O
550 O
km O
by O
2020 O
, O
which O
will O
surpass O
that O
of O
New O
York O
, O
the O
USA O
, O
to O
become O
the O
No. O
1 O
in O
the O
world O
. O

However O
, O
at O
least O
several O
hundred O
billion O
yuan O
will O
be O
needed O
for O
this O
project O
. O

[buabua] O
A O
large O
number O
of O
big O
and O
small O
metro O
projects O
throughout O
the O
country O
have O
formed O
the O
huge O
invested O
construction O
scale O
of O
our O
country O
. O

[buabua] O
Currently O
the O
investments O
in O
our O
country O
are O
mainly O
spent O
on O
three O
major O
areas O
including O
infrastructure O
, O
enterprise O
facilities O
and O
real O
estate O
. O

From O
these O
aspects O
, O
this O
wave O
of O
economic O
construction O
in O
our O
country O
is O
far O
from O
completion O
. O

[buabua] O
Let O
's O
look O
at O
infrastructure O
first O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
various O
indexes O
such O
as O
railway O
, O
highway O
and O
communications O
, O
there O
is O
a O
certain O
disparity O
between O
our O
country O
and O
developed O
countries O
. O

[buabua] O
In O
the O
example O
of O
Beijing O
Metro O
I O
mentioned O
above O
, O
the O
length O
of O
the O
subway O
in O
Beijing O
is O
less O
than O
100 O
km O
at O
present O
, O
which O
is O
still O
far O
from O
550 O
km O
. O

[buabua] O
As O
for O
how O
many O
metros O
will O
be O
constructed O
in O
the O
whole O
country O
, O
there O
will O
be O
at O
least O
ten O
thousand O
kilometers O
. O

[buabua] O
To O
calculate O
the O
cost O
at O
500 O
million O
yuan O
per O
kilometer O
, O
an O
investment O
of O
five O
or O
six O
trillion O
yuan O
will O
be O
needed O
. O

[buabua] O
In O
addition O
the O
construction O
of O
real O
estate O
can O
hardly O
cool O
down O
within O
two O
or O
three O
years O
. O

The O
investment O
in O
real O
estate O
accounts O
for O
about O
20 O
% O
of O
the O
total O
investment O
in O
fixed O
assets O
, O
and O
the O
investment O
amount O
this O
year O
is O
estimated O
to O
reach O
18 O
trillion O
yuan O
, O
increasing O
by O
approximately O
25 O
% O
year O
- O
on O
- O
year O
, O
but O
it O
is O
relatively O
low O
compared O
with O
other O
industries O
. O

[buabua] O
With O
an O
annual O
fund O
investment O
of O
more O
than O
one O
trillion O
yuan O
, O
construction O
of O
so O
many O
buildings O
is O
a O
piece O
of O
good O
news O
for O
improvement O
of O
Chinese O
people O
's O
residence O
and O
office O
conditions O
. O

[buabua] O
Over O
the O
recent O
years O
, O
more O
than O
300 O
million O
square O
meters O
of O
building O
area O
has O
been O
increased O
each O
year O
in O
our O
country O
, O
and O
per O
capita O
housing O
average O
has O
been O
increasing O
. O

It O
is O
estimated O
that O
China O
can O
basically O
step O
out O
of O
the O
housing O
bottleneck O
and O
enter O
into O
oversupply O
period O
in O
a O
few O
years O
. O

[buabua] O
But O
in O
the O
area O
of O
enterprises O
, O
China O
has O
just O
started O
to O
catch O
up O
with O
developed O
countries O
. O

[buabua] O
If O
the O
industrialization O
of O
our O
country O
in O
the O
1980s O
and O
1990s O
was O
only O
the O
industrialization O
in O
light O
industry O
and O
household O
electric O
appliance O
industry O
, O
then O
the O
industrialization O
in O
our O
country O
has O
entered O
into O
the O
stage O
of O
heavy O
chemical O
industry O
since O
the O
21st O
century O
. O

[buabua] O
Development O
during O
this O
stage O
mainly O
concentrates O
on O
large O
equipment O
and O
machinery O
industry O
. O

[buabua] O
These O
days O
, O
TV O
news O
is O
reporting O
that O
an O
enterprise O
in O
Shanxi O
has O
manufactured O
a O
large O
excavator O
for O
coal O
mining O
. O

This O
shows O
that O
Chinese O
enterprises O
are O
finally O
starting O
to O
tackle O
large O
machinery O
. O

[buabua] O
Some O
news O
even O
said O
that O
China O
has O
started O
preparing O
to O
manufacture O
100,000 O
- O
ton O
aircraft O
carriers O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
in O
the O
field O
of O
ship O
building O
industry O
, O
China O
has O
already O
had O
the O
capacity O
and O
conditions O
to O
manufacture O
aircraft O
carriers O
. O

[buabua] O
Next O
, O
China O
will O
independently O
design O
and O
manufacture O
complete O
sets O
of O
equipment O
for O
large O
- O
scale O
enterprises O
in O
the O
heavy O
chemical O
industry O
. O

[buabua] O
Only O
when O
China O
is O
able O
to O
produce O
such O
large O
key O
equipment O
by O
itself O
can O
China O
reverse O
the O
development O
mode O
of O
mercantilism O
as O
well O
as O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
fate O
of O
being O
in O
the O
processing O
trade O
as O
the O
world O
factory O
. O

[buabua] O
China O
is O
stepping O
into O
modernization O
, O
and O
high O
speed O
is O
needed O
by O
the O
development O
of O
the O
country O
. O

As O
long O
as O
the O
development O
is O
reasonable O
, O
a O
growth O
rate O
of O
10 O
% O
is O
not O
high O
. O

The O
key O
is O
to O
understand O
and O
solve O
the O
following O
problems O
. O

[buabua] O
II. O
China O
's O
economy O
is O
very O
" O
heavy O
. O
" O

[buabua] O
At O
present O
the O
second O
feature O
of O
the O
economy O
in O
our O
country O
is O
" O
heaviness O
, O
" O
and O
such O
situation O
is O
caused O
by O
two O
major O
reasons O
. O

[buabua] O
Firstly O
, O
our O
country O
is O
at O
the O
times O
of O
hardware O
construction O
and O
must O
be O
dealing O
with O
materials O
such O
as O
land O
, O
wood O
, O
steel O
and O
cement O
. O

[buabua] O
Secondly O
, O
our O
country O
is O
entering O
into O
the O
stage O
of O
heavy O
chemical O
industry O
development O
. O

As O
we O
become O
increasingly O
competitive O
, O
we O
are O
competing O
more O
successfully O
for O
the O
industries O
that O
developed O
countries O
were O
engaged O
in O
before O
, O
and O
in O
the O
meantime O
, O
developed O
countries O
are O
shifting O
to O
us O
the O
heavy O
chemical O
industry O
that O
they O
do O
not O
want O
to O
be O
engaged O
in O
. O

[buabua] O
Two O
major O
sectors O
, O
" O
knowledge O
- O
based O
industry O
" O
and O
" O
material O
- O
based O
industry O
, O
" O
have O
emerged O
during O
the O
current O
world O
development O
. O

Developed O
countries O
are O
increasingly O
entering O
into O
" O
knowledge O
- O
based O
industry O
" O
while O
developing O
countries O
are O
mostly O
entering O
into O
" O
material O
- O
based O
industry O
. O
" O

[buabua] O
The O
knowledge O
- O
based O
industry O
is O
weightless O
, O
clean O
and O
environment O
- O
friendly O
with O
high O
added O
value O
. O

[buabua] O
The O
material O
- O
based O
industry O
is O
heavy O
, O
tangible O
and O
pollutant O
with O
low O
added O
value O
. O

[buabua] O
Such O
features O
make O
the O
present O
economic O
activities O
in O
our O
country O
particularly O
heavy O
. O

[buabua] O
These O
years O
a O
saying O
has O
been O
circulating O
in O
our O
country O
that O
China O
has O
consumed O
30 O
% O
of O
the O
steel O
, O
40 O
% O
of O
the O
cement O
, O
and O
30 O
% O
of O
the O
coal O
in O
the O
world O
but O
only O
has O
produced O
4 O
% O
of O
its O
GDP O
. O

[buabua] O
Such O
huge O
consumption O
of O
energy O
resources O
and O
raw O
materials O
only O
created O
such O
a O
small O
GDP O
. O

It O
indicates O
the O
feature O
of O
" O
heaviness O
" O
of O
our O
economy O
. O

The O
volume O
is O
heavy O
, O
but O
the O
value O
is O
low O
. O

[buabua] O
Such O
feature O
has O
also O
resulted O
in O
soaring O
prices O
of O
energies O
and O
raw O
materials O
in O
the O
world O
in O
recent O
years O
. O

[buabua] O
The O
international O
markets O
have O
been O
aware O
of O
China O
's O
needs O
and O
taken O
this O
opportunity O
to O
raise O
prices O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
China O
will O
go O
on O
with O
the O
development O
anyway O
, O
because O
there O
is O
in O
fact O
a O
considerable O
disparity O
between O
developed O
countries O
and O
us O
. O

[buabua] O
We O
can O
see O
the O
disparity O
between O
our O
country O
and O
the O
US O
in O
hardware O
construction O
by O
giving O
an O
example O
. O

[buabua] O
In O
the O
100 O
years O
of O
the O
last O
century O
, O
the O
US O
produced O
and O
consumed O
8.4 O
billion O
metric O
tons O
of O
steel O
in O
total O
, O
but O
it O
was O
only O
1.8 O
billion O
metric O
tons O
for O
our O
country O
. O

The O
disparity O
between O
the O
two O
countries O
is O
more O
than O
6 O
billion O
metric O
tons O
. O

[buabua] O
Both O
countries O
cover O
an O
area O
of O
more O
than O
900 O
square O
kilometers O
, O
however O
the O
reinforced O
concrete O
cast O
in O
the O
US O
land O
might O
be O
several O
times O
more O
than O
in O
China O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
per O
capita O
amount O
, O
and O
it O
may O
take O
China O
many O
years O
to O
catch O
up O
with O
the O
infrastructure O
alone O
. O

[buabua] O
Even O
if O
China O
produces O
500 O
million O
metric O
tons O
of O
steel O
each O
year O
in O
the O
future O
, O
it O
will O
still O
take O
about O
15 O
- O
20 O
years O
to O
fill O
the O
gap O
. O

[buabua] O
In O
particular O
, O
in O
terms O
of O
industrial O
structure O
, O
the O
developed O
countries O
have O
currently O
walked O
out O
of O
the O
stage O
of O
heavy O
chemical O
industry O
in O
succession O
, O
the O
industries O
in O
developed O
countries O
begin O
to O
become O
" O
light O
, O
" O
and O
their O
heavy O
chemical O
industries O
are O
gradually O
shifted O
to O
developing O
countries O
like O
China O
. O

[buabua] O
China O
is O
in O
no O
position O
to O
pick O
and O
choose O
but O
take O
over O
the O
industries O
abandoned O
by O
others O
. O

This O
makes O
the O
industrial O
structure O
of O
China O
very O
" O
heavy O
" O
during O
the O
whole O
process O
of O
global O
division O
of O
labor O
. O

[buabua] O
If O
China O
becomes O
the O
manufacture O
workshop O
of O
the O
world O
's O
heavy O
chemical O
industry O
in O
the O
next O
20 O
years O
, O
the O
outcome O
will O
be O
quite O
different O
from O
today O
. O

[buabua] O
At O
present O
, O
most O
of O
the O
import O
and O
export O
trade O
of O
our O
country O
is O
in O
processed O
products O
. O

[buabua] O
When O
heavy O
chemical O
industrial O
products O
become O
the O
main O
import O
and O
export O
products O
of O
our O
country O
in O
the O
future O
, O
a O
great O
change O
will O
again O
take O
place O
in O
the O
economic O
structure O
and O
the O
import O
and O
export O
trade O
of O
our O
country O
. O

The O
feature O
of O
" O
heaviness O
" O
of O
economic O
activities O
will O
be O
very O
obvious O
. O

[buabua] O
I O
recalled O
the O
year O
2001 O
when O
the O
Internet O
craze O
and O
knowledge O
- O
based O
economy O
craze O
appeared O
at O
home O
and O
abroad O
, O
some O
people O
getting O
so O
excited O
believed O
that O
China O
could O
rely O
on O
the O
Internet O
alone O
in O
the O
future O
. O

[buabua] O
I O
could O
n't O
help O
throwing O
cold O
water O
on O
them O
by O
writing O
an O
article O
, O
saying O
that O
China O
would O
still O
stay O
at O
the O
stage O
of O
civil O
construction O
and O
steel O
economy O
in O
the O
future O
. O

[buabua] O
Now O
when O
I O
look O
back O
on O
it O
, O
it O
becomes O
clearer O
. O

[buabua] O
In O
sum O
, O
dealing O
with O
material O
- O
based O
economy O
will O
be O
what O
Chinese O
people O
are O
going O
to O
do O
for O
a O
long O
historical O
stage O
in O
the O
future O
. O

This O
, O
of O
course O
, O
will O
have O
to O
consume O
a O
large O
amount O
of O
land O
resources O
and O
environment O
resources O
. O

[buabua] O
China O
will O
face O
serious O
crisis O
of O
environment O
resources O
. O

[buabua] O
Therefore O
, O
China O
should O
take O
a O
two O
- O
way O
approach O
in O
the O
future O
by O
paying O
attention O
to O
both O
material O
- O
based O
industry O
and O
knowledge O
- O
based O
economy O
. O

Never O
be O
tricked O
by O
the O
theory O
of O
global O
labor O
division O
. O

[buabua] O
III. O
A O
relatively O
large O
wealth O
funnel O
exists O
in O
China O
's O
economy O
. O

[buabua] O
Although O
the O
Chinese O
economy O
is O
growing O
rapidly O
, O
the O
distribution O
of O
national O
wealth O
is O
unbalanced O
, O
and O
a O
large O
disparity O
exists O
in O
the O
living O
conditions O
of O
citizens O
. O

[buabua] O
In O
particular O
, O
when O
compared O
internationally O
, O
people O
find O
that O
a O
relatively O
large O
wealth O
funnel O
exists O
in O
the O
growth O
of O
China O
's O
economy O
. O

[buabua] O
For O
example O
, O
in O
Japan O
and O
South O
Korea O
, O
the O
rapid O
economic O
growth O
lasted O
less O
than O
20 O
years O
, O
and O
their O
annual O
growth O
rates O
were O
lower O
than O
China O
's O
, O
but O
these O
countries O
very O
quickly O
entered O
the O
ranks O
of O
the O
developed O
countries O
. O

[buabua] O
In O
Japan O
during O
the O
period O
from O
the O
1950s O
to O
the O
1980s O
, O
the O
annual O
salary O
increase O
rate O
was O
70 O
% O
higher O
than O
in O
the O
US O
, O
and O
the O
salary O
level O
had O
caught O
up O
with O
the O
US O
within O
less O
than O
30 O
years O
. O

[buabua] O
With O
regard O
to O
the O
development O
of O
our O
country O
, O
for O
most O
workers O
and O
farmers O
, O
the O
achievements O
of O
economic O
development O
are O
like O
a O
black O
hole O
. O

[buabua] O
Why O
has O
n't O
there O
been O
substantial O
change O
in O
the O
living O
conditions O
of O
most O
common O
people O
after O
nearly O
30 O
years O
of O
reform O
? O

Many O
people O
are O
even O
still O
living O
in O
poverty O
. O

[buabua] O
Where O
is O
the O
national O
wealth O
created O
by O
such O
a O
high O
economic O
growth O
? O

[buabua] O
In O
spite O
of O
the O
numerous O
skyscrapers O
under O
construction O
in O
various O
large O
cities O
today O
, O
some O
of O
those O
luxurious O
facilities O
have O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
Chinese O
people O
. O

[buabua] O
A O
lot O
of O
assets O
and O
wealth O
in O
China O
do O
not O
belong O
to O
Chinese O
people O
. O

[buabua] O
At O
present O
, O
the O
GDP O
-LRB- O
gross O
domestic O
product O
-RRB- O
of O
our O
country O
has O
reached O
over O
20 O
trillion O
, O
but O
at O
least O
40 O
% O
belongs O
to O
foreigners O
. O

[buabua] O
Thus O
, O
the O
phenomena O
of O
the O
high O
economic O
growth O
, O
the O
low O
income O
of O
people O
, O
and O
the O
large O
outflow O
of O
profits O
have O
emerged O
during O
the O
development O
of O
China O
. O

[buabua] O
This O
situation O
makes O
many O
people O
question O
the O
economic O
development O
of O
our O
country O
: O
where O
did O
the O
achievements O
of O
development O
go O
? O

[buabua] O
In O
my O
opinion O
, O
the O
wealth O
funnel O
in O
China O
's O
economic O
development O
lies O
in O
four O
areas O
. O

[buabua] O
Firstly O
, O
the O
large O
amount O
of O
exports O
has O
resulted O
in O
an O
outflow O
of O
resources O
and O
national O
wealth O
at O
a O
low O
price O
. O

[buabua] O
Secondly O
, O
the O
large O
introduction O
of O
foreign O
capital O
has O
also O
resulted O
in O
the O
large O
outflow O
of O
profits O
. O

[buabua] O
Thirdly O
, O
the O
huge O
amounts O
of O
unreported O
incomes O
derived O
from O
special O
rights O
and O
corruption O
are O
finding O
their O
way O
to O
foreign O
countries O
through O
diverse O
channels O
. O

[buabua] O
Fourthly O
, O
the O
low O
efficiency O
and O
low O
returns O
of O
state O
- O
owned O
enterprises O
have O
also O
wasted O
a O
large O
amount O
of O
national O
wealth O
. O

[buabua] O
The O
problems O
in O
these O
four O
areas O
have O
caused O
the O
rapid O
development O
and O
quick O
loss O
of O
China O
's O
economy O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

[buabua] O
Therefore O
, O
in O
a O
country O
that O
only O
pays O
attention O
to O
economic O
growth O
but O
neglects O
political O
reform O
, O
the O
effects O
of O
economic O
development O
will O
be O
questionable O
in O
the O
end O
. O

[buabua] O
But O
today O
, O
this O
issue O
is O
just O
being O
put O
forward O
, O
and O
it O
will O
become O
clearer O
and O
more O
obvious O
in O
the O
future O
. O

[buabua] O
Regarding O
this O
point O
, O
some O
problems O
can O
be O
explained O
by O
providing O
only O
one O
figure O
. O

[buabua] O
During O
the O
period O
of O
more O
than O
20 O
years O
since O
the O
reform O
and O
opening O
- O
up O
, O
the O
unreported O
income O
from O
property O
rental O
has O
been O
a O
huge O
number O
. O

[buabua] O
In O
the O
1990s O
, O
the O
economist O
Hu O
Heli O
et O
al. O
did O
the O
calculation O
and O
found O
that O
the O
discrepancies O
in O
prices O
, O
exchange O
currencies O
, O
and O
interests O
as O
well O
as O
other O
rentals O
amounted O
to O
456.9 O
billion O
yuan O
in O
1988 O
, O
accounting O
for O
40 O
% O
of O
the O
GNP O
-LRB- O
1,173.8 O
billion O
yuan O
-RRB- O
of O
that O
year O
. O

[buabua] O
Recently O
, O
Gao O
Huiqing O
et O
al. O
of O
the O
State O
Information O
Center O
made O
the O
calculation O
and O
found O
that O
in O
2004 O
the O
amount O
of O
rent O
from O
property O
rentals O
in O
the O
whole O
country O
reached O
4.6 O
trillion O
yuan O
, O
accounting O
for O
29 O
% O
of O
the O
GNP O
of O
that O
year O
, O
which O
was O
equivalent O
to O
1.5 O
times O
the O
national O
fiscal O
revenue O
of O
that O
year O
, O
and O
2.3 O
times O
the O
national O
salary O
income O
of O
that O
year O
. O

[buabua] O
No O
matter O
how O
inaccurate O
these O
figures O
might O
be O
, O
they O
show O
a O
problem O
: O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
unfair O
and O
unequal O
incomes O
in O
our O
country O
, O
and O
this O
has O
enabled O
a O
number O
of O
people O
to O
easily O
obtain O
a O
huge O
amount O
of O
wealth O
and O
has O
also O
given O
rise O
to O
corruption O
. O

[buabua] O
Since O
our O
country O
is O
a O
backward O
developing O
country O
, O
those O
who O
get O
rich O
first O
are O
always O
likely O
to O
migrate O
to O
developed O
countries O
. O

[buabua] O
This O
has O
taken O
away O
a O
lot O
of O
wealth O
from O
our O
country O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
a O
regular O
phenomenon O
has O
occurred O
in O
our O
country O
: O
development O
and O
loss O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

[buabua] O
This O
has O
been O
the O
difference O
between O
the O
development O
of O
our O
country O
and O
the O
development O
of O
Japan O
and O
South O
Korea O
: O
a O
huge O
wealth O
funnel O
exists O
in O
the O
development O
of O
our O
country O
, O
but O
such O
funnel O
is O
very O
small O
in O
Japan O
and O
South O
Korea O
. O

[buabua] O
Of O
course O
whether O
my O
opinion O
is O
correct O
or O
not O
will O
be O
proved O
by O
time O
, O
but O
I O
must O
point O
it O
out O
for O
the O
citizens O
of O
our O
country O
, O
because O
this O
is O
my O
responsibility O
. O

[buabua] O
Only O
after O
overcoming O
these O
problems O
can O
China O
achieve O
quicker O
and O
better O
development O
. O

[buabua] O
All O
in O
all O
, O
achievements O
are O
the O
main O
trend O
, O
but O
problems O
should O
be O
pointed O
out O
and O
solved O
. O

[buabua] O
IV. O
The O
economic O
growth O
will O
not O
slow O
down O
in O
a O
short O
period O
. O

[buabua] O
When O
the O
year O
2006 O
is O
coming O
to O
the O
end O
, O
people O
always O
make O
various O
predictions O
for O
the O
next O
year O
. O

[buabua] O
At O
the O
end O
of O
each O
year O
, O
I O
always O
have O
to O
deal O
with O
a O
large O
number O
of O
questionnaires O
provided O
by O
various O
news O
media O
and O
research O
institutions O
. O

[buabua] O
Speaking O
about O
the O
speed O
of O
economy O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
China O
's O
economy O
will O
not O
slow O
down O
in O
a O
short O
period O
. O

[buabua] O
In O
2007 O
, O
China O
's O
economy O
will O
continue O
with O
the O
momentum O
of O
2006 O
with O
an O
economic O
growth O
rate O
of O
no O
less O
than O
9 O
% O
. O

[buabua] O
For O
China O
, O
opportunities O
and O
challenges O
will O
coexist O
in O
2007 O
. O

[buabua] O
From O
the O
perspective O
of O
the O
world O
economy O
, O
the O
economy O
tends O
to O
be O
less O
active O
in O
some O
countries O
, O
providing O
an O
opportunity O
as O
well O
as O
a O
challenge O
to O
China O
. O

[buabua] O
The O
world O
development O
is O
unbalanced O
today O
, O
just O
like O
in O
the O
1930s O
, O
when O
the O
capitalist O
countries O
in O
Europe O
and O
America O
were O
in O
the O
Great O
Depression O
, O
it O
was O
the O
time O
for O
great O
economic O
development O
of O
the O
Soviet O
Union O
. O

[buabua] O
China O
should O
grasp O
the O
opportunity O
and O
lose O
no O
time O
carrying O
out O
development O
. O

[buabua] O
When O
energy O
prices O
are O
too O
high O
, O
causing O
some O
countries O
to O
slow O
down O
their O
economic O
growth O
, O
it O
might O
be O
the O
great O
time O
for O
the O
development O
of O
China O
. O

[buabua] O
But O
in O
the O
new O
year O
, O
the O
trend O
of O
economic O
structure O
adjustment O
in O
our O
country O
will O
arrive O
inevitably O
. O

[buabua] O
For O
China O
's O
economy O
, O
the O
largest O
challenge O
is O
to O
adjust O
the O
" O
strategy O
of O
earning O
foreign O
exchange O
" O
which O
was O
established O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
reform O
and O
opening O
- O
up O
more O
than O
20 O
years O
ago O
, O
correct O
the O
inordinate O
development O
mode O
of O
mercantilism O
, O
and O
lay O
emphasis O
on O
domestic O
development O
. O

[buabua] O
Currently O
, O
what O
needs O
adjustment O
most O
is O
the O
export O
- O
oriented O
economy O
structure O
. O

[buabua] O
Such O
structure O
has O
brought O
prosperity O
to O
China O
but O
also O
has O
produced O
negative O
effects O
on O
China O
's O
economy O
. O

[buabua] O
At O
present O
, O
the O
foreign O
exchange O
reserve O
of O
our O
country O
has O
reached O
over O
one O
trillion O
US O
dollars O
. O

Such O
development O
mode O
is O
the O
typical O
mode O
of O
development O
based O
on O
foreign O
loans O
. O

If O
such O
development O
strategy O
is O
adopted O
for O
a O
long O
term O
, O
a O
huge O
international O
risk O
will O
exist O
in O
the O
foreign O
exchange O
reserve O
; O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
living O
standard O
of O
Chinese O
people O
can O
hardly O
be O
improved O
. O

[buabua] O
Therefore O
, O
putting O
forth O
great O
efforts O
to O
correct O
the O
development O
mode O
of O
our O
country O
after O
2007 O
has O
become O
an O
important O
issue O
for O
the O
future O
. O

[buabua] O
The O
year O
2007 O
should O
be O
a O
key O
year O
for O
China O
's O
economic O
development O
. O

[buabua] O
The O
high O
economic O
growth O
starting O
from O
2003 O
is O
entering O
into O
the O
year O
2007 O
, O
which O
will O
be O
a O
harvesting O
year O
for O
appraisal O
of O
achievements O
. O

[buabua] O
In O
this O
year O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
projects O
that O
were O
initiated O
some O
years O
ago O
will O
be O
completed O
and O
put O
into O
operation O
, O
and O
many O
other O
projects O
are O
winding O
up O
. O

So O
the O
year O
2007 O
will O
be O
a O
connecting O
link O
between O
the O
preceding O
and O
the O
following O
years O
. O

[buabua] O
China O
must O
ensure O
the O
stable O
economic O
development O
in O
2007 O
in O
order O
to O
harvest O
the O
fruit O
of O
economic O
development O
. O

[buabua] O
2007 O
is O
also O
the O
year O
in O
which O
China O
's O
economy O
will O
enter O
into O
a O
new O
stage O
. O

[buabua] O
In O
the O
new O
year O
, O
new O
great O
goals O
will O
be O
implemented O
. O

[buabua] O
Plans O
such O
as O
the O
long O
- O
expected O
3G O
Plan O
may O
all O
be O
initiated O
in O
2007 O
. O

[buabua] O
Therefore O
, O
2007 O
is O
a O
year O
for O
assurance O
. O

Whether O
from O
the O
macroscopic O
and O
long O
- O
term O
perspective O
or O
from O
the O
short O
- O
term O
perspective O
of O
the O
2008 O
Olympic O
Games O
, O
2007 O
should O
be O
a O
year O
for O
assurance O
. O

[buabua] O
At O
this O
moment O
, O
the O
Chinese O
government O
and O
enterprises O
should O
keep O
calm O
to O
deal O
with O
various O
changes O
appearing O
in O
international O
markets O
and O
grasp O
all O
kinds O
of O
favorable O
opportunities O
promptly O
and O
with O
no O
lessened O
efforts O
. O

[buabua] O
The O
Chinese O
government O
and O
enterprises O
must O
realize O
that O
the O
campaign O
to O
turn O
around O
China O
's O
economy O
has O
just O
started O
, O
and O
commanders O
at O
all O
levels O
must O
spare O
no O
effort O
in O
winning O
each O
local O
battle O
. O

[buabua] O
Only O
with O
dedication O
and O
perseverance O
can O
we O
catch O
up O
with O
the O
advancing O
world O
. O

Is O
it O
Really O
Healthy O
to O
Drink O
Milk O
on O
Empty O
Stomach O
? O

Healthy B-PERSON
and I-PERSON
happy I-PERSON

Protein O
will O
be O
wasted O
to O
drinking O
milk O
on O
empty O
stomach O
? O

Some O
say O
drinking O
milk O
on O
empty O
stomach O
will O
consume O
the O
protein O
wastefully O
as O
energy O
, O

but O
actually O
milk O
contains O
about O
45 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
lactose O
, O
which O
is O
carbohydrate O
that O
will O
decompose O
first B-ORDINAL
to O
supply O
energy O
and O
save O
protein O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
milk O
also O
contains O
about O
3 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
fat O
, O
which O
also O
plays O
the O
role O
of O
supplying O
energy O
. O

Therefore O
, O
drinking O
milk O
on O
empty O
stomach O
will O
not O
lead O
to O
protein O
waste O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
infants O
under O
the O
age O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
can O
drink O
milk O
on O
empty O
stomach O
and O
absorb O
nutrients O
proves O
that O
milk O
contains O
a O
variety O
of O
nutrients O
that O
can O
be O
fully O
used O
by O
the O
human O
body O
. O

Even O
if O
the O
digestion O
rate O
will O
be O
slightly O
lowered O
, O
it O
is O
healthier O
to O
drink O
milk O
on O
empty O
stomach O
than O
to O
eat O
nothing O
the O
whole O
morning O
when O
there O
is O
no O
time O
for O
breakfast O
. O

Tip O
: O
drink O
boiled O
water O
before O
milk O
. O

It O
is O
not O
appropriate O
to O
take O
milk O
as O
the O
only O
drink O
in O
the B-TIME
early I-TIME
morning I-TIME
. O

When O
you O
get O
up O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
it O
's O
better O
to O
drink O
a O
big O
glass O
of O
boiled O
water O
-LRB- O
light O
honey O
water O
is O
better O
in O
case O
of O
a O
dry O
indoor O
environment O
during O
the O
heating O
season O
-RRB- O
before O
consuming O
milk O
. O

As O
milk O
has O
higher O
osmotic O
pressure O
, O
it O
is O
far O
less O
quick O
and O
effective O
compared O
to O
boiled O
water O
in O
terms O
of O
supplying O
moisture O
. O

Who O
can O
not O
drink O
milk O
on O
empty O
stomach O
? O

What O
needs O
our O
attention O
is O
that O
if O
there O
are O
abdominal O
distention O
or O
diarrhea O
after O
drinking O
milk O
, O
it O
is O
then O
indeed O
inappropriate O
to O
drink O
a O
lot O
of O
milk O
with O
on O
empty O
stomach O
. O

It O
is O
better O
to O
have O
some O
starchy O
food O
before O
you O
drink O
milk O
in O
multiple O
small O
serves O
, O
and O
it O
is O
better O
to O
have O
yogurt O
. O

Experts O
said O
milk O
can O
not O
be O
consumed O
on O
empty O
stomach O
20 B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
because O
Chinese B-NORP
had O
few O
chances O
to O
drink O
milk O
. O

Once O
they O
were O
weaned O
from O
breast O
milk O
, O
they O
hardly O
saw O
any O
dairy O
products O
. O

Long O
- O
term O
separation O
from O
dairy O
products O
led O
to O
" O
lactose O
intolerance O
" O
of O
the O
body O
. O

People O
suffered O
abdominal O
distention O
, O
diarrhea O
or O
dyspepsia O
whenever O
they O
drink O
milk O
. O

If O
they O
drink O
too O
fast O
, O
especially O
drinking O
milk O
on O
empty O
stomach O
, O
the O
symptom O
would O
exacerbate O
. O

Now O
time O
is O
different O
, O
and O
the O
diet O
pattern O
has O
also O
changed O
. O

Many O
children O
and O
young O
people O
often O
consume O
milk O
, O
yogurt O
, O
ice O
cream O
and O
even O
cheese O
since O
childhood O
, O
which O
bring O
them O
strong O
ability O
to O
digest O
milk O
lactose O
. O

Even O
if O
they O
drink O
milk O
on O
empty O
stomach O
, O
they O
will O
not O
feel O
uncomfortable O
. O

So O
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
remark O
of O
" O
no O
milk O
on O
an O
empty O
stomach O
" O
should O
be O
changed O
, O
at O
least O
with O
a O
premise O
added O
, O
instead O
of O
being O
generalized O

Three B-CARDINAL
stages O

setting O
up O

from O

The O
critical O
path O
of O
success O

Talking O
about O
setting O
up O
a O
business O

Now O
, O
as O
the O
Internet O
grows O
, O
the O
Internet O
economy O
has O
passed O
through O
a O
" O
bubble O
era O
" O
and O
is O
gradually O
moving O
toward O
a O
dazzling O
springtime O
. O

When O
you O
look O
at O
the O
IT O
giants O
that O
have O
sprouted O
up O
one O
after O
the O
other O
on O
the O
Internet O
, O
do O
you O
get O
excited O
? O

Are O
you O
worried O
? O

Are O
you O
determined O
? O

Setting O
up O
an O
Internet O
business O
is O
an O
idea O
that O
appeals O
to O
people O
. O

Because O
: O
1. B-CARDINAL
Low O
cost O

Unless O
they O
are O
undertaking O
a O
very O
large O
project O
, O
Internet O
entrepreneurs O
do O
not O
need O
much O
capital O
. O

Perhaps O
one O
computer O
+ O
ADSL O
+ O
a O
dummy O
mainframe O
+ O
a O
small O
room O
and O
you O
can O
get O
started O
. O

But O
this O
is O
still O
far O
, O
far O
from O
success O
. O

Some O
people O
may O
scoff O
that O
this O
ca O
n't O
be O
called O
setting O
up O
a O
business O
. O

If O
you O
have O
plenty O
of O
funds O
, O
very O
sharp O
thinking O
, O
and O
a O
classic O
idea O
, O
you O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
read O
what O
I O
wrote O
. O

But O
do O
n't O
stick O
up O
your O
nose O
; O
for O
the O
time O
being O
we O
're O
not O
talking O
about O
the O
relationship O
between O
capital O
and O
profit O
. O

You O
feel O
that O
if O
the O
cost O
is O
insignificant O
, O
the O
profit O
must O
not O
be O
worth O
mentioning O
. O

Well O
, O
now O
I O
'm O
telling O
you O
you're O
're O
wrong O
. O

This O
traditional O
cost O
- O
profit O
relationship O
just O
does O
n't O
work O
on O
the O
Internet O
. O

Because O
you O
've O
overlooked O
one O
thing O
, O
and O
that O
's O
your O
own O
intelligence O
and O
ability O
. O

In O
setting O
up O
an O
Internet O
business O
, O
this O
holds O
a O
more O
important O
position O
. O

The O
Internet O
is O
absolutely O
a O
place O
for O
the O
daring O
to O
be O
forceful O
. O

If O
you O
have O
the O
ability O
, O
you O
can O
hope O
to O
succeed O
. O

2. B-CARDINAL
Low O
start O
- O
up O
cost O

Internet O
communications O
are O
now O
well O
developed O
. O

It O
can O
be O
said O
that O
all O
you O
need O
is O
broadband O
, O
and O
you O
've O
solved O
most O
of O
your O
Internet O
communication O
problems O
and O
can O
save O
yourself O
a O
lot O
of O
telephone O
charges O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
you O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
go O
out O
and O
rent O
a O
storefront O
and O
pay O
exorbitant O
rents O
. O

Early O
on O
, O
before O
you O
've O
formally O
registered O
the O
company O
, O
you O
also O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
be O
bothered O
with O
lots O
of O
petty O
charges O
and O
taxes O
. O

3. B-CARDINAL
Staffing O
is O
very O
simple O
; O
in O
the O
early O
stages O
many O
entrepreneurs O
start O
from O
scratch O
, O
with O
one B-CARDINAL
person O
handling O
all O
tasks O
. O

Because O
one B-CARDINAL
person O
can O
basically O
cope O
with O
everything O
in O
the O
early O
stages O
, O
there O
is O
no O
need O
to O
incur O
personnel O
costs O
. O

4. B-CARDINAL
The O
risk O
is O
low O
, O
so O
if O
the O
business O
fails O
, O
you O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
be O
afraid O
. O

Because O
the O
initial O
investment O
is O
low O
, O
there O
are O
greater O
opportunities O
for O
turnover O
. O

Therefore O
the O
entrepreneur O
can O
give O
up O
without O
fearing O
the O
consequences O
of O
failure O
. O

5. B-CARDINAL
High O
profit O

If O
you O
succeed O
early O
on O
in O
setting O
up O
your O
business O
and O
continue O
on O
down O
the O
right O
path O
of O
development O
, O
then O
I O
congratulate O
you O
. O

Now O
you O
can O
shout O
it O
out O
: O
" O
My O
Web O
site O
is O
making O
a O
profit O
! O
" O

But O
do O
n't O
let O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
bucket O
of O
money O
you O
make O
go O
to O
your O
head O
. O

Do O
n't O
forget O
, O
the O
higher O
you O
climb O
, O
the O
higher O
you O
'll O
fall O
. O

Remind O
yourself O
that O
now O
is O
the O
time O
you O
need O
to O
keep O
a O
close O
watch O
on O
developments O
in O
market O
trends O
and O
among O
your O
competitors O
. O

Promptly O
adjust O
your O
growth O
strategy O
. O

Only O
then O
will O
you O
be O
smiling O
at O
the O
end O
. O

Maybe O
when O
you O
read O
about O
the O
advantages O
of O
establishing O
an O
Internet O
business O
above O
, O
your O
heart O
was O
racing O
and O
you O
were O
thinking O
you O
'd O
really O
work O
hard O
to O
make O
it O
. O

Below O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
discuss O
some O
of O
the O
areas O
that O
you O
need O
to O
pay O
attention O
to O
when O
setting O
up O
an O
Internet O
business O
: O

1. B-CARDINAL
Use O
your O
own O
unique O
vision O
to O
examine O
the O
Internet O
and O
look O
for O
new O
ways O
to O
make O
a O
profit O
. O

Aggressively O
investigate O
new O
projects O
; O
avoid O
blindly O
imitating O
others O
. O

Are O
there O
lots O
of O
people O
doing O
this O
kind O
of O
thing O
on O
the O
Internet O
? O

If O
a O
flashA.com O
appears O
on O
the O
Net O
today O
, O
tomorrow O
there O
will O
be O
flashC.com O
and O
flashD.com O
. O

If O
that O
's O
the O
case O
, O
your O
odds O
of O
failing O
just O
increased O
by O
30 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
. O

Remember O
: O
If O
you O
're O
always O
following O
on O
somebody O
else O
's O
tail O
, O
then O
what O
you'll O
get O
will O
always O
be O
someone O
else O
's O
trash O
, O
picked O
over O
, O
cast O
aside O
and O
unused O
. O

Of O
course O
we O
're O
not O
opposed O
to O
imitating O
, O
but O
what O
we O
should O
think O
about O
is O
why O
is O
this O
person O
taking O
that O
route O
, O
and O
not O
which O
route O
is O
this O
person O
taking O
. O

Then O
we O
will O
study O
the O
line O
of O
thought O
and O
the O
skills O
he O
used O
to O
solve O
problems O
. O

So O
we O
will O
gain O
more O
than O
he O
did O
. O

2. B-CARDINAL
If O
you O
've O
selected O
a O
given O
project O
and O
are O
carrying O
it O
out O
, O
then O
you O
should O
definitely O
carry O
it O
through O
to O
the O
end O
; O
avoid O
switching O
course O
in O
midstream O
. O

Of O
course O
when O
I O
say O
see O
it O
through O
to O
the O
end O
, O
this O
does O
not O
mean O
to O
continue O
blindly O
, O
sticking O
with O
it O
even O
when O
you O
know O
full O
well O
it O
's O
hopeless O
. O

What O
I O
mean O
is O
, O
do O
n't O
be O
distracted O
, O
doing O
SMS O
today O
and O
selling O
things O
tomorrow O
, O
with O
a O
new O
approach O
every O
day O
. O

You O
see O
somebody O
else O
doing O
something O
that O
makes O
money O
, O
and O
you O
think O
you O
want O
to O
do O
that O
. O

Your O
website O
is O
simply O
the O
" O
art O
of O
changing O
your O
look O
" O
like O
in O
Sichuan B-NORP
opera O
. O

A O
new O
face O
every O
day O
, O
completely O
different O
. O

What O
I O
recommend O
is O
that O
when O
you O
set O
up O
your O
business O
you O
should O
give O
it O
careful O
consideration O
and O
fully O
investigate O
its O
feasibility O
. O

Once O
you O
set O
out O
to O
do O
something O
, O
you O
should O
pursue O
the O
goal O
you O
set O
for O
yourself O
, O
sticking O
with O
it O
unless O
really O
forced O
to O
give O
up O
. O

3. B-CARDINAL
Use O
your O
hands O
, O
eyes O
and O
brain O
, O
be O
observant O
and O
alert O
, O
and O
consider O
all O
possibilities O
. O

Avoid O
acting O
rashly O
when O
you O
set O
up O
your O
Internet O
business O
. O

Your O
mind O
needs O
to O
be O
sharp O
; O
the O
Internet O
offers O
virtually O
unlimited O
business O
opportunities O
; O
maybe O
it O
's O
just O
a O
small O
opportunity O
, O
but O
you O
should O
seize O
it O
. O

Then O
maybe O
you O
will O
succeed O
. O

Otherwise O
if O
the O
opportunity O
was O
right O
in O
front O
of O
you O
and O
you O
did O
n't O
seize O
it O
. O

So O
... O
you O
need O
nimble O
hands O
. O

If O
you O
come O
upon O
something O
important O
, O
by O
all O
means O
make O
a O
note O
of O
it O
, O
and O
so O
on O
. O

Your O
eyes O
need O
to O
be O
sharp O
: O
you O
need O
to O
spot O
changes O
in O
the O
IT O
situation O
right O
away O
and O
quickly O
prepare O
a O
short O
- O
term O
business O
plan O
. O

Like O
right O
now O
, O
many O
portal O
sites O
are O
seizing O
the O
opportunity O
of O
the O
Olympics B-EVENT
to O
considerably O
increase O
their O
traffic O
. O

I O
think O
advertising O
revenues O
in O
this O
area O
alone O
will O
be O
considerable O
. O

4. B-CARDINAL
Be O
tough O
and O
resilient O
: O
avoid O
the O
easy O
route O
. O

Setting O
up O
an O
Internet O
business O
is O
hard O
labor O
. O

When O
you O
're O
just O
setting O
up O
your O
business O
, O
it O
is O
sometimes O
hard O
to O
avoid O
feeling O
completely O
exhausted O
. O

Sometimes O
you O
'll O
just O
feel O
like O
throwing O
in O
the O
towel O
. O

Do O
n't O
forget O
: O
if O
you O
were O
working O
for O
someone O
else O
, O
you O
would O
n't O
like O
it O
either O
, O
and O
may O
feel O
even O
worse O
! O

5. B-CARDINAL
You O
need O
to O
learn O
to O
look O
for O
partners O
. O

6. B-CARDINAL
You O
need O
to O
know O
what O
Internet O
marketing O
is O
, O
and O
learn O
how O
to O
use O
it O
. O

Are O
you O
looking O
for O
an O
already O
proven O
, O
feasible O
way O
to O
increase O
your O
sources O
of O
income O
? O

Are O
you O
looking O
for O
an O
opportunity O
to O
create O
both O
free O
time O
and O
financial O
freedom O
? O

Do O
you O
have O
dreams O
or O
goals O
that O
you O
want O
to O
reach O
? O

making O
progress O
, O
some O
people O
have O
the O
nerve O
to O
talk O
about O
revolution O
!!! O

So O
as O
not O
to O
take O
his O
words O
out O
of O
context O
, O
I O
will O
insofar O
as O
possible O
cite O
Professor O
Zhang B-PERSON
's O
explanation O
of O
revolution O
: O

" O
In O
reality O
, O
' O
the O
way O
' O
- O
or O
we O
can O
call O
it O
' O
reason O
' O
- O
has O
quite O
a O
complex O
relationship O
with O
the O
law O
. O

What O
we O
call O
' O
reason O
' O
involves O
looking O
at O
what O
you O
do O
to O
see O
whether O
it O
creates O
value O
for O
society O
. O

' O
Reason O
' O
is O
above O
' O
law O
' O
: O
reasonable O
things O
have O
a O
natural O
validity O
; O
lawmaking O
should O
be O
carried O
out O
according O
to O
the O
demands O
of O
reason O
; O
unreasonable O
laws O
are O
not O
correct O
. O

But O
in O
China B-GPE
, O
both O
in O
the O
past O
and O
now O
, O
there O
are O
many O
reversals O
of O
the O
natural O
order O
between O
law O
and O
reason O
; O
thus O
making O
it O
hard O
to O
judge O
if O
a O
so O
- O
called O
" O
illegal O
" O
thing O
is O
also O
unreasonable O
. O

For O
example O
, O
when O
there O
was O
a O
revolution O
in O
the O
past O
, O
it O
was O
precisely O
the O
most O
idealistic O
people O
who O
were O
willing O
to O
sacrifice O
their O
lives O
. O

Why O
sacrifice O
their O
lives O
? O

Because O
it O
was O
illegal O
. O

Or O
take O
bribery O
for O
example O
. O

When O
someone O
is O
being O
blackmailed O
, O
he O
hands O
over O
the O
money O
, O
and O
that O
is O
a O
form O
of O
bribery O
. O

But O
you O
ca O
n't O
say O
that O
his O
doing O
that O
is O
wrong O
: O
at O
least O
he O
deserves O
our O
empathy O
. O

In O
human O
history O
, O
there O
is O
a O
clear O
standard O
for O
good O
and O
evil O
, O
righteousness O
and O
iniquity O
, O
advances O
and O
reversals O
, O
glory O
and O
shame O
, O
progress O
and O
reaction O
, O
etc O
. O

This O
standard O
is O
: O

Things O
that O
are O
for O
the O
majority O
, O
for O
the O
masses O
of O
people O
, O
for O
altruism O
are O
good O
, O

, O

, O

Things O
that O
are O
for O
the O

against O

are O
bad O
, O
unrighteous O
, O
shameful O
, O
reactionary O

Revolution O
is O
clearly O
a O
thing O
for O
the O
majority O
, O
for O
the O
masses O
of O
people O
, O
and O
altruistic O
; O
therefore O
revolution O
is O
good O

righteous O

And O

no O

On O

: O

If O

[jilian] O
In O
dealing O

the O
US O
always O
likes O
to O
use O
its O
hard O
side O
-- O
its O
great O
military O
strength O

[jilian] O
This O
is O
very O
expensive O
, O
and O
is O
also O
very O
dangerous O
to O
itself O
-LRB- O
particularly O
if O
China O
uses O

against O

-RRB- O
, O
and O
will O
not O
necessarily O
achieve O
the O
desired O
result O

[jilian] O
But O
if O
the O
US O
changes O
to O
another O
method O
of O
dealing O
with O
China O
, O
it O
might O
be O
much O
more O
effective O
. O

[jilian] O
If O
the O
US O
wants O
to O
crush O
China O
, O
it O
should O
find O
out O
what O
China O
's O
biggest O
weakness O
is O
. O

[jilian] O
This O
is O
the O
only O
way O
to O
really O
hit O
the O
spot O
. O

[jilian] O
I O
personally O
think O
China O
's O
biggest O
weakness O
at O
the O
moment O
is O
" O
corruption O
. O
" O

[jilian] O
The O
problem O
of O
corruption O
arises O
in O
every O
country O
, O

[jilian] O
but O
what O
's O
worrying O
is O
that O
in O
China O
today O
official O
corruption O
is O
too O
widespread O
. O

Even O
more O
worrying O
is O
the O
public O
's O
level O
of O
acceptance O
of O
corruption O
. O

[jilian] O
With O
this O
weak O
point O
in O
mind O
, O
the O
key O
to O
crushing O
China O
does O
not O
lie O
in O
setting O
up O
however O
many O
bases O
around O
China O
or O
preparing O
however O
much O
world O
class O
weaponry O
. O

It O
just O
needs O
the O
US O
government O
to O
use O
half O
an O
aircraft O
carrier O
- O
worth O
of O
money O
to O
set O
up O
a O
fund O
, O
and O
secretly O
bribe O
China O
's O
key O
officials O
. O

[jilian] O
It O
would O
n't O
look O
good O
for O
a O
government O
to O
undertake O
this O
kind O
of O
slimy O
activity O
. O

A O
company O
or O
individual O
could O
be O
asked O
to O
do O
it O

In O

Do O

Make O

I O
used O
to O
work O
for O
an O
accounting O
firm O
in O
China B-GPE
. O

It O
's O
not O
a O
big O
city O
, O
but O
I O
always O
thought O
the O
job O
I O
had O
was O
not O
as O
hard O
as O
others O
imagine O
. O

Perhaps O
that O
's O
because O
people O
before O
me O
had O
long O
established O
a O
set O
of O
models O
. O

I O
'd O
like O
to O
ask O
those O
who O
have O
passed O
CPA O
exams O
in O
the O
US B-GPE
whether O
you O
are O
making O
a O
good O
living O
. O

It O
's O
also O
very O
hard O
for O
me O
to O
pass O
the O
CPA O
exams O
in O
China B-GPE
. O

And O
now O
in O
the O
US B-GPE
, O
I O
may O
find O
an O
average O
school O
to O
study O
for O
a B-WORK_OF_ART
master I-WORK_OF_ART
's I-WORK_OF_ART
degree I-WORK_OF_ART
, O
and O
then O
, O
and O
then O
do O
I O
have O
to O
start O
preparing O
for O
CPA O
exams O
here O
too O
? O

Also O
, O
in O
China B-GPE
CPA O
and O
certified O
tax O
agents O
are O
separate O
. O

In O
the O
US B-GPE
, O
are O
there O
exams O
for O
certified O
tax O
agents O
? O

Is O
the O
work O
of O
tax O
agents O
done O
by O
accounting O
firms O
as O
well O
in O
the O
US B-GPE
? O

Happiness O

[A14062] O
The O

[A14062] O
The O
most O
