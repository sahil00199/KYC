one B-CARDINAL
of O

from O

increasing O
by O
about B-CARDINAL
half I-CARDINAL
over O
the B-DATE

Within O
that O
, O
in O
the B-DATE

7 I-DATE

, O
takeovers O

, O

, O
reached O
1062 B-CARDINAL
, O
accounting O
for O
one B-CARDINAL
fourth I-CARDINAL
of O
all O

Regardless O
of O
whether O
it O
is O
the O
number O
of O

companies O
or O
the O
value O
of O

assets O
, O
both O
exceeded O
or O
were O
close O
to O
the O
peak O
of O
US B-GPE
company O
takeovers O
in O
the B-DATE
late I-DATE
'80's I-DATE
. O

Observers O
here O
hold O
that O
since B-DATE
1994 I-DATE
, O
reasons O
for O
the O
US B-GPE
company O
takeover O
trend O
differ O
from O
those O
of O
the O
past O
. O

Firstly B-ORDINAL
, O
the O
general O
trend O
of O
globalization O
of O
the O
world O
economy O
compels O
companies O
to O
expand O
scale O
and O
combine O
businesses O
, O
increase O
their O
overall O
competitive O
strength O
and O
to O
reduce O
costs O
. O

Secondly B-ORDINAL
, O
the O
Clinton B-PERSON
government O
's O
thoughts O
and O
actions O
in O
constructing O
the O
information O
highway O
, O
adjusting O
the O
financial O
industry O
and O
reforming O
the O
medical O
insurance O
system O
compels O
related O
companies O
to O
make O
strategic O
adjustments O
. O

Moreover O
, O
the B-ORG
White I-ORG
House I-ORG
's I-ORG
attitude O
towards O
anti-trust O
laws O
is O
somewhat O
more O
relaxed O
than O
before O
. O

Taking O
the O
pharmaceutical O
and O
medical O
equipment O
companies O
as O
an O
example O
, O
reforms O
of O
hospitals O
expanding O
scales O
of O
purchasing O
medicine O
and O
medical O
treatment O
equipment O
, O
and O
thus O
reducing O
unit O
costs O
and O
expanding O
services O
, O
have O
spread O
throughout O
the O
country O
. O

That O
the B-ORG
Columbia I-ORG
Medical I-ORG
Company I-ORG
purchased O
two B-CARDINAL
hospital O
groups O
within B-DATE
one I-DATE
month I-DATE
last I-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
thus O
integrating O
pharmaceuticals O
, O
medical O
treatment O
and O
sales O
, O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
such O
example O
. O

For O
telecommunications O
companies O
, O
the O
merger O
of O
telephone O
companies O
with O
cable O
TV O
and O
wireless O
communications O
companies O
frequently O
is O
to O
mutually O
complement O
one O
another O
in O
operations O
and O
to O
dominate O
the O
market O
. O

Recently O
, O
the O
US B-GPE
Congress B-ORG
passed O
an O
inter-state O
banking O
law O
, O
allowing O
regional O
banks O
to O
operate O
in O
other O
states O
. O

Handholding O
among O
banks O
is O
also O
to O
reduce O
overlapping O
services O
so O
as O
to O
reduce O
costs O
, O
to O
strengthen O
base O
assets O
, O
and O
expand O
credit O
scales O
. O

For O
military O
industry O
enterprises O
, O
the O
merger O
of O
Lockheed B-ORG
and O
Martin B-ORG
and O
the O
combination O
of O
two B-CARDINAL
old O
- O
brand O
corporations O
, O
namely O
Northrop B-ORG
and O
Grumman B-ORG
, O
are O
both O
due O
to O
the O
same O
reason O
: O
after O
the O
cold O
war O
, O
the O
America B-GPE
's O
national O
defense O
expenditures O
gradually O
reduced O
, O
and O
the O
scale O
and O
strength O
of O
military O
industry O
enterprises O
is O
one O
of O
the O
conditions O
necessary O
for O
winning O
limited O
government O
weapons O
purchasing O
contracts O
. O

Observers O
here O
believe O
that O
company O
takeovers O
has O
a O
positive O
aspect O
, O
i.e. O
, O
the O
reduction O
of O
cost O
, O
the O
increase O
in O
efficiency O
, O
and O
the O
strengthening O
of O
competitive O
power O
. O

But O
, O
many O
takeovers O
are O
obviously O
actions O
that O
must O
be O
taken O
for O
companies O
to O
survive O
. O

However O
, O
history O
has O
proven O
that O
" O
big O
and O
complete O
" O
monopolies O
of O
production O
and O
sales O
is O
not O
beneficial O
to O
the O
national O
economy O
's O
healthy O
development O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
in O
the B-DATE
'70's I-DATE
, O
mergers O
of O
US B-GPE
steel O
mills O
directly O
led O
to O
the O
birth O
of O
a O
few O
large O
- O
scale O
unified O
steel O
companies O
, O
but O
these O
companies O
also O
faced O
serious O
threats O
from O
small O
- O
scale O
steel O
mills O
, O
which O
are O
flexible O
in O
operation O
and O
advanced O
in O
technology O
. O

Moreover O
, O
company O
takeovers O
have O
had O
bad O
effects O
on O
consumers O
in O
terms O
of O
product O
quality O
and O
price O
, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
on O
workers O
' O
employment O
. O

While O
voice O
has O
been O
given O
to O
the O
opinion O
that O
small O
enterprises O
are O
the O
new O
forces O
of O
economic O
growth O
, O
scaled O
operation O
of O
big O
corporations O
will O
constantly O
face O
new O
difficulties O

a O

' O

are O
still O

This O

which O
combine O
to O
make O
a O
brilliant O

glorious O

This O
is O
exactly O
why O

wins O
the O
strong O
admiration O
of O

from O
many O

of O

American B-NORP

Mr. O

have O

a O

We O
appreciate O
their O
absolute O
sincerity O

The O

" O

, O
recommended O

works O
and O

budding O

scattered O
in O
various O
places O
, O
and O
has O
been O
deeply O
welcomed O
by O
readers O
. O

In O
the O
appraisal O
and O
selection O
process O
, O
the O
standards O
we O
emphasized O
were O
: O
conforming O
to O
classical O
requirements O
of O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
art O
of O
calligraphy O
; O
healthy O
language O
diction O
, O
readable O
handwriting O
; O
certain O
standards O
of O
writing O
methods O
; O
solid O
skills O
, O
and O
self O
- O
establishing O
a O
new O
artistic O
concept O
-- O
these O
are O
the O
characteristics O
of O
our O
Chinese B-NORP
art O
of O
calligraphy O
, O
and O
because O
we O
have O
these O
characteristics O
, O
we O
won O
the O
attention O
of O
foreign O
friends O
. O

Therefore O
, O
any O
work O
that O
can O
follow O
tradition O
but O
not O
stagnate O
, O
and O
have O
new O
artistic O
concepts O
will O
be O
appraised O
well O
. O

In O
a O
serious O
yet O
harmonious O
discussion O
, O
the O
judges O
thinking O
achieved O
unity O
and O
decided O
this O
round O
's O
outstanding O
entries O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
kind O
of O
situation O
embarrassed O
the O
judges O
, O
namely O
, O
that O
some O
works O
displayed O
really O
beautifully O
written O
characters O
, O
conformed O
to O
a O
certain O
calligraphy O
style O
, O
and O
showed O
signs O
of O
new O
achievement O
in O
art O
form O
, O
but O
regretfully O
, O
because O
the O
calligraphers O
have O
poor O
basic O
knowledge O
, O
they O
wrote O
some O
wrong O
characters O
, O
and O
since O
there O
was O
no O
remedy O
, O
finally O
lost O
in O
the O
selection O
. O

Everyone O
both O
felt O
pity O
for O
them O
, O
and O
felt O
that O
this O
is O
an O
issue O
very O
worth O
worrying O
about O
. O

Some O
young O
calligraphy O
lovers O
, O
just O
at O
the O
time O
when O
they O
should O
have O
been O
studying O
hard O
, O
were O
hindered O
. O

So O
basic O
knowledge O
was O
not O
enough O
, O
structure O
was O
not O
systematic O
, O
and O
the O
level O
was O
rather O
low O
. O

They O
have O
some O
ability O
in O
calligraphy O
, O
but O
eventually O
can O
not O
produce O
a O
final O
masterpiece O
at O
a O
higher O
level O
, O
and O
can O
not O
create O
works O
which O
may O
be O
used O
as O
teaching O
models O
. O

We O
sincerely O
hope O
that O
these O
friends O
will O
amend O
this O
aspect O
quickly O
, O
and O
hope O
future O
works O
will O
show O
both O
superior O
capability O
in O
calligraphy O
, O
and O
convey O
healthy O
and O
deep O
thoughts O
, O
and O
even O
reveal O
a O
clear O
, O
meaningful O
and O
elegant O
mind O
. O

This O
is O
the O
eager O
expectation O
that O
many O
older O
- O
generation O
calligraphers O
have O
placed O
on O
us O
younger O
- O
generation O

The O
reasons O

both O

I O
believe O
that O
the O
drop O
in O
the O
volume O
of O

between O
China B-GPE

is O
only O
a O

from O
each O

It O
not O

However O
, O
this O

I O
extended O
my O

raised O
my O

imagining O

hoping O
for O
a O

at O
the O

but O
only O
saw O

I O
saw O
no O

The O
large O

started O
up O

I O
thought O

this O

we O

Suddenly O
a O

that O

Thereupon O
, O
I O

: O
" O
Why O
are O
we O
going O

So O
evidently O
the O
bus O
really O
was O
carrying O
us O
down O
the O
mountain O
! O

That O
being O
the O
case O
, O
I O
lost O
no O
time O
in O
again O
catching O
an O
eyeful O
of O
Fuji B-LOC

I O
practically O
glued O
my O
eyes O
to O
the O

By O

just O

looking O
at O
the O
ever O

changing O
clouds O
, O
they O
were O
fortuitously O
located O
at O
the O
summit O
, O
and O
resembling O
cotton O
, O
they O
tore O
open O
a O
hole O
as O

deliberately O
allowing O
the O
" O

one O

venture O

as O
if O
seeing O
me O
off O

also O
as O
if O
laughing O
at O
me O
. O

For O
an O
instant O
, O
a O
sigh O
of O
regret O
for O
" O
great O
aspirations O
difficult O
to O
fulfill O
" O
overwhelmed O
me O
! O

Because O
I O
'd O
already O
come O
across O
a O
face O
that O
resembled O
an O
old O
man O
of O
lofty O
mountains O
many O
times O
! O

At O
a O
spacious O
and O
luxurious O
restaurant O
at O
the O
foot O
of O
Fuji B-LOC
we O
ate O
a O
definitely O
not O
sumptuous O
western O
meal O
. O

Everyone O
hurriedly O
cast O
aside O
cups O
and O
plates O
, O
then O
without O
leave O
went O
nearby O
and O
viewed O
and O
enjoyed O
the O
famous O

the O

At O
this O

the O
weather O
got O
overcast O
and O
the O
water O
of O
the O

was O
still O
like O

with O
the O

that O
it O
had O
a O

In O

the O

that O
most O
caused O

express O

The O
luxurious O
growth O

seemed O
exactly O
like O

In O

us O
so O
enthralled O
by O

In O

a O

this O

the O

This O

At O

Although O

He O
forecast O
that O
the O

growth O
rate O
for O
the O

this O

would O
fall O
from O
the B-PERCENT

down O

Nakamura B-PERSON
thought O
that O
the O
rate O
of O
economic O
growth O
of O
Asia B-LOC

countries O

regions O
, O
with O
Korea B-GPE

Thailand B-GPE
being O
the O
most O
prominent O
, O
would O
slide O
downward O
to O
a O
large O
extent O
. O

But O
, O
he O
said O
, O
for O
these O
countries O
the O
currencies O
already O
have O
devalued O
to O
a O
great O
degree O
, O
exports O
have O
recovered O
, O
and O
imports O
could O
decrease O
. O

Because O
of O
this O
, O
he O
expected O
that O
their O
economies O
would O
slip O
downward O
to O
the O
lowest O
point O
in O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
half I-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

He O
estimated O
that O
the O
rate O
of O
economic O
growth O
in O
ASEAN B-ORG
would O
be O
about B-PERCENT
4.5 I-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
. O

Nakamura B-PERSON
said O
that O
the O
Japanese B-NORP
economy O
exhibited O
negative O
growth O
in O
the B-DATE
year I-DATE
'97 I-DATE
, O
and O
that O
in O
'98 B-DATE
, O
if O
it O
did O
n't O
adopt O
good O
economic O
policies O
, O
the O
economy O
would O
continue O
to O
be O
in O
negative O
growth O
. O

He O
estimated O
it O
would O
be O
negative B-PERCENT
0.5 I-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
, O
plus O
or O
minus O
. O

He O
said O
further O
that O
China B-GPE
's O
economic O
growth O
would O
also O
slow O
in O
speed O
, O
feeling O
the O
effects O
of O
the O

Japan B-GPE
and O
Asia B-LOC
being O
depressed O
and O
of O
the O

of O
these O

. O

But O
because O
China B-GPE

usual O
income O

show O
a O
favorable O
balance O
, O
and O
in O

it O

East B-LOC
Asia I-LOC
undoubtedly O

Although O

we O

First B-ORDINAL
, O
debt O

Besides O

good O

that O

Second B-ORDINAL
, O
bond O

Henceforth O

the O
main O

international O

reduce O

of O
our O

Third B-ORDINAL

In O

, O
rapid O

this O

The O
White O

since O
the B-DATE
90's I-DATE
, O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
important O
ingredients O
of O
the O
growth O
of O
China B-GPE
's O
foreign O
trade O
exports O
was O
the O
expansion O
of O
processing O
trade O
exports O
. O

China B-GPE
's O
processing O
trade O
was O
mainly O
developed O
from O
the O
transfer O
of O
labor O
- O
intensive O
manufacturing O
industries O
or O

from O
developed O
countries O
such O

By O

product O
exporting O

shifted O
from O
these O

to O
China B-GPE

The O
White O
Paper O
said O
that O
in O
recent B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
two B-CARDINAL
thirds I-CARDINAL
of O
China B-GPE

exports O
to O
the O

transferred O
out O

region O

These O
products O

value O

added O
rates O

Hong B-GPE

larger O

exports O
, O
then O
China B-GPE

trade O
surplus O
with O
the O
US B-GPE
could O
correspondingly O
decrease O
, O
even O
becoming O
a O
deficit O
. O

The O
White O
Paper O
thereby O
drew O
the O
conclusion O
and O
held O
that O
, O
when O
using O
original O
production O
site O
statistics O
, O
its O
limitations O
must O
be O
fully O
recognized O
, O
superficial O
figures O
must O
be O
seen O
through O
, O
and O
the O
actual O
benefit O
that O
each O
party O
achieves O
from O
trade O
must O
be O
seriously O
analyzed O
. O

This O
will O
then O
help O
to O
eliminate O

, O
and O
appropriately O
solve O
trade O
disputes O
between O
countries O
. O

At O
the O

, O
one B-CARDINAL
must O
also O
consider O
the O
increasingly O

of O
increasingly O

He O
called O
for O
all O
countries O
in O
the O
world O
to O
strengthen O
co-operation O
and O
to O
promote O
the O
continuous O
development O
of O
the O
world O
economy O
. O

He O
said O
that O
in O
1996 B-DATE
world O
economic O
growth O
had O
some O
acceleration O
, O
that O
the O
pressure O
of O
global O
inflation O
was O
further O
reduced O
, O
and O
that O
the O
level O
of O
world O
economy O
integration O
significantly O
increased O
. O

But O
the O
long O
- O
term O
continuous O
development O
of O
the O
world O
economy O
still O
faces O
quite O
a O
lot O
of O
macro-economic O
imbalance O
factors O
and O
structural O
obstacles O
. O

Apart O
from O
each O
country O
's O
efforts O
to O
mainly O
depend O
on O
itself O
, O
strengthening O
international O
co-operation O
will O
help O
to O
eliminate O
stumbling O
factors O
in O
the O
growth O
of O
the O
world O
economy O
. O

He O
pointed O
out O
that O
in O
some O
European B-NORP
industrial O
countries O
current O
economy O
lagging O
is O
mainly O
due O
to O
structural O
obstacles O
such O
as O
over O
- O
burdened O
social O
welfare O
systems O
and O
the O
ossification O
of O
labor O
markets O
that O
have O
been O
existing O
for O
a O
long O
time O
, O
etc O
. O

Accelerating O
the O
pace O
of O
structural O
reform O
will O
not O
only O
be O
beneficial O
to O
promoting O
the O
economic O
recovery O
of O
these O
countries O
and O
the O
development O
of O
the O
European B-NORP
economy O
and O
currency O
union O
, O
but O
will O
also O
have O
active O
effects O
on O
the O
continuous O
growth O
of O
the O
world O
economy O
. O

Other O
industrial O
countries O
should O
also O
make O
use O
of O
the O
present O
opportunity O
while O
the O
economic O
situation O
is O
still O
good O
to O
reduce O
budget O
deficits O
and O
increase O
the O
dynamics O
of O
structural O
reform O
. O

Yuan B-PERSON
Chen I-PERSON
believed O
that O
because O
most O
of O
the O
developing O
countries O
are O
actively O
promoting O
structural O
reform O
and O
adopting O
measures O
to O
stabilize O
their O
economy O
, O
these O
countries O
as O
a O
unified O
body O
have O
maintained O
a O
growth O
rate O
of O
above O
6 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
for O
5 B-DATE
years I-DATE
running O
. O

Moreover O
, O
they O
have O
good O
prospects O
to O
continue O
to O
maintain O
such O
a O
strong O
growth O
trend O
. O

The O
contribution O
of O
developing O
countries O
to O
the O
development O
of O
the O
world O
economy O
is O
increasingly O
large O
. O

The O
degree O
of O
contact O
with O
one O
another O
and O
with O
other O
countries O
in O
the O
world O
is O
increasing O
, O
and O
the O
disparities O
in O
economic O
growth O
between O
regions O
appear O
to O
be O
on O
a O
narrowing O
trend O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
Yuan B-PERSON
Chen I-PERSON
emphasized O
that O
economic O
development O
among O
the O
developing O
countries O
is O
still O
not O
even O
. O

The O
economy O
in O
many O
countries O
is O
still O
very O
fragile O
. O

Their O
debts O
are O
still O
heavy O
and O
the O
poverty O
situation O
is O
worsening O
. O

In O
the O
spirit O
of O
development O
and O
co-operation O
, O
the O
international O
community O
should O
adopt O
realistic O
and O
feasible O
measures O
to O
help O
these O
developing O
countries O
solve O
these O
problems O
. O

He O
said O
that O
in O
recent B-DATE
years I-DATE
the O
signs O
of O
globalization O
of O
the O
world O
economy O
are O
becoming O
more O
and O
more O
obvious O
, O
and O
that O
the O
world O
economy O
has O
been O
greatly O
pushed O
towards O
prosperity O
. O

The O
unification O
of O
the O
world O
economy O
is O
intensifying O
with O
each O
passing O
day O
. O

Facing O
the O
challenges O
brought O
by O
globalization O
, O
each O
country O
should O
continuously O
implement O
sound O
economic O
policies O
and O
deepen O
structural O
reform O
so O
as O
to O
enjoy O
the O
most O
benefits O
from O
the O
process O
of O
globalization O
and O
to O
minimize O
the O
negative O
effects O
. O

Yuan B-PERSON
Chen I-PERSON
also O
pointed O
out O
that O
what O
causes O
worry O
is O
that O
some O
industrial O
countries O
take O
labor O
standards O
, O
environment O
and O
human O
rights O
, O
etc. O
, O
as O
excuses O
to O
frequently O
adopt O
trade O
protection O
measures O
. O

This O
severely O
affects O
the O
future O
of O
world O
economy O
and O
trade O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
there O
are O
still O
a O
number O
of O
developing O
countries O
that O
have O
not O
benefited O
from O
the O
progress O
of O
globalization O
. O

In O
this O
connection O
, O
he O
appealed O
to O
the O
industrial O
countries O
to O
eliminate O
obstacles O
to O
the O
progress O
of O
the O
globalization O
of O
the O
world O

as O

as O

the O

While O
