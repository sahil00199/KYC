of O
which O
Al B-ORG

Arabi I-ORG
received O
a O
copy O
, O
added O
that O
at O
a O
time O
when O
Iraqi B-NORP
national O
forces O
are O
seeking O
to O
obtain O
a O
timetable O
for O
the O
withdrawal O
of O
the O
occupation O
forces O
from O
our O
country O
, O
taking O
advantage O
of O
the O
political O
developments O
on O
the O
American B-NORP
scene O
to O
take O
this O
injustice O
and O
despotism O
away O
from O
our O
people O
, O
the O
present O
government O
is O
seeking O
once O
again O
to O
grant O
the O
occupation O
a O
chance O
to O
stay O
on O
, O
holding O
on O
to O
its O
presence O
for O
no O
other O
reason O
than O
to O
secure O
guarantees O
of O
its O
remaining O
in O
power O
at O
the O
expense O
of O
suspending O
the O
interests O
of O
the O
Iraqis B-NORP
, O
their O
violated O
sacred O
sites O
, O
and O
their O
blood O
that O
bleeds O
like O
rivers O

every O
day O
. O

The O
statement O
added O
that O
this O
is O
an O
expected O
step O
from O
a O
government O
under O
an O
oppressive O
occupation O
claiming O
that O
its O
presence O
is O
necessary O
to O
spread O
security O
and O
stability O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
and O
for O
Iraq B-GPE
to O
transition O
to O
the O
realm O
of O
freedom O
, O
democracy O
and O
prosperity O
, O
of O
which O
we O
continue O
to O
hear O
but O
see O
no O
traces O
or O
existence O
in O
our O
land O
. O

This O
is O
the O
fact O
of O
the O
situation O
in O
general O
in O
our O
country O
, O
particularly O
the O
security O
situation O
, O
which O
has O
declined O
throughout O
the O
lean O
years O
of O
the O
occupation O
to O
such O
bad O
, O
deteriorating O
conditions O
that O
it O
can O
not O
be O
hidden O
from O
anyone O
, O
near O
or O
far O
, O
so O
much O
so O
that O
the O
harbingers O
of O
disaster O
and O
strife O
are O
looming O
. O

This O
fact O
clearly O
leaves O
those O
who O
want O
the O
best O
for O
Iraq B-GPE
and O
its O
people O
with O
no O
alternative O
but O
to O
communicate O
that O
bitter O
painful O
reality O
to O
the O
world O
. O

The B-ORG
Board I-ORG
went O
on O
in O
its O
statement O
that O
such O
a O
step O
confirms O
what O
we O
have O
always O
said O
: O
that O
the O
political O
process O
under O
occupation O
will O
not O
succeed O
in O
bringing O
sovereignty O
back O
to O
Iraq B-GPE
, O
because O
the O
occupation O
will O
remain O
in O
control O
of O
it O
. O

Neither O
the O
government O
nor O
the O
parliament O
will O
have O
an O
effective O
will O
against O
the O
will O
of O
the O
occupier O
, O
and O
the O
members O
of O
the O

refuse O
to O
admit O
this O
fact O

prove O
it O

Amid O

Al B-PERSON

Hayat I-PERSON
has O
learned O
that O
Levni B-PERSON
informed O
the O
French B-NORP
side O
, O
during O
her O
recent O
visit O
to O
Paris B-GPE
, O
that O
Israel B-GPE
will O
not O
make O
moves O
towards O
withdrawing O
from O
Shebaa B-LOC
Farms I-LOC
prior O
to O
a O
comprehensive O
peace O
agreement O
. O

Sources O
saw O
Israel B-GPE
as O
wanting O
to O
hold O
back O
all O
its O
cards O
in O
the O
Lebanon B-GPE
file O
, O
including O
Shebaa B-GPE
, O
because O
it O
does O
not O
know O
how O
things O
will O
develop O
in O
Lebanon B-GPE
. O

The O
French B-NORP
side O
insisted O
during O
talks O
with O
the O
Israeli B-NORP
Minister O
on O
the O
need O
to O
strengthen O
Fuad B-PERSON
Siniora I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
government O
through O
a O
political O
victory O
by O
having O
Israel B-GPE
state O
its O
willingness O
to O
withdraw O
from O

, O
under O
a O
Lebanese B-NORP
government O
that O
respects O
the O

However O
, O
sources O
noted O
that O
" O
Israel B-GPE
does O
not O
agree O
to O
such O
a O
step O
" O
, O
saying O
that O
" O
there O
is O
a O
widespread O
impression O
among O
circles O
informed O
on O
Israeli B-NORP
politics O
that O
just O
as O
Israel B-GPE
wants O
the O
current O
Syrian B-NORP
regime O
to O
stay O
in O
place O
- O
and O
it O
proved O
this O
in O
its O
war O
on O
Lebanon B-GPE
last O
summer O
- O
then O
with O
the O
same O
logic O
, O
it O
is O
comfortable O
with O
a O
Syrian B-NORP
regime O
in O
Lebanon B-GPE
and O
a O
government O
in O
which O
Hizbollah B-ORG
is O
represented O
but O
under O
the O
control O
of O
a O
specific O
, O
known O
Syrian B-NORP
regime O
" O
. O

The O
sources O
said O
that O
Levni B-PERSON
did O
not O
come O
up O
with O
anything O
new O
on O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
front O
but O
" O
reiterated O
the O
usual O
position O
which O
says O
that O
Israel B-GPE
does O
a O
lot O
, O
is O
committed O
to O
the O
ceasefire O
and O
self O
- O
control O
and O
that O
the O

the O
Israeli B-NORP

-LRB- O
Ehud B-PERSON
Olmert I-PERSON

has O
extended O

the O
need O
for O

The O

that O

a O

no O
way O
prepared O
to O
consent O
to O
this O
region O
, O
the O
closest O
and O
dearest O
to O
its O
heart O
, O
remaining O
in O
a O
state O
of O
permanent O
chaos O
. O

What O
affects O
the O
people O
of O
the B-LOC
Middle I-LOC
East I-LOC
affects O
the O
Europeans B-NORP
directly O
and O
vice O
versa O
. O

This O
has O
always O
been O
so O
and O
this O
is O
the O
reason O
this O
relationship O
has O
a O
distinct O
and O
unique O
style O
. O

Today O
, O
I O
see O
four B-QUANTITY
challenges O
which O
we O
have O
to O
face O
together O
: O
the O
Arab B-NORP
- O
Palestinian B-NORP
conflict O
, O
the O
Iranian B-NORP
nuclear O
issue O
, O
the O
situation O
in O
Lebanon B-GPE
and O
the O
war O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

My O
view O
of O
the O
conflict O
between O
the O
Palestinians B-NORP
and O
Israelis B-NORP
is O
not O
new O
as O
I O
have O
always O
considered O
that O
this O
conflict O
is O
, O
in O
one O
way O
or O
another O
, O
at O
the O
heart O
of O
all O
the O
other O
conflicts O
. O

Perhaps O
resolving O
this O
conflict O
will O
not O
necessarily O
lead O
to O
a O
resolution O
of O
other O
current O
regional O
crises O
but O
it O
will O
deprive O
fundamentalist O
rhetoric O
of O
its O
usual O
justifications O
and O
this O
would O
be O
a O
big O
step O
in O
its O
own O
right O
. O

When O
the O
Palestinians B-NORP
manage O
, O
tomorrow O
or O
after O
tomorrow O
, O
to O
agree O
to O
form O
a O
new O
national O
unity O
government O
, O
this O
will O
constitute O
an O
important O
step O
towards O
a O
solution O
. O

when O
he O
said O
that O
it O

the O
duty O

He O

, O
" O
The O
immigrant O
's O
right O
to O

balanced O

He O

that O
" O
Christians B-NORP

Muslims B-NORP

Hindus B-NORP

Sikhs B-NORP

" O
This O
is O
exactly O
what O
we O
mean O
when O
we O
describe O
Britain B-GPE

a O
multicultural O

society O

" O

He O
defended O
his O
government O

call O
to O
open O
a O
debate O
on O
extremism O
after O
the O
London B-GPE
bombings O
in O
2005 B-DATE

in O
order O
to O
determine O
the O
motives O
of O
the O
Muslim B-NORP
youth O
in O
executing O
such O
attacks O
. O

He O
stated O
that O
extremism O
" O
is O
not O
confined O
to O
Muslims B-NORP
, O
as O
experience O
has O
taught O
us O
in O
Northern B-GPE
Ireland I-GPE
and O
from O
some O
elements O
in O
ethnic O
communities O

" O

" O
So O
when O
we O
speak O
about O
combating O
extremism O
, O
we O
do O
not O
mean O
the O
whole O
Muslim B-NORP
community O
, O
but O
elements O
of O
it O
. O
" O

He O
explained O
that O
, O
" O
Extremism O
is O
not O
a O
problem O

Hindu B-NORP
, O
African B-NORP
, O
Caribbean B-NORP
, O
Chinese B-NORP
, O
or O
Polish B-NORP
origins O

It O
is O
also O
not O
considered O
a O
problem O
related O
to O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
Muslim B-NORP
community O
, O
because O
that O
majority O
is O
law O
- O
abiding O
and O
is O
proud O
to O
be O
Muslim B-NORP
of O
British B-NORP
nationality O
. O

It O
is O
a O
problem O
with O
a O
minority O
of O
that O
community O
, O
particularly O
those O
originating O
from O
certain O
countries O
, O
" O
which O
he O
did O

A O

The O

British B-NORP
Intelligence O
documents O
that O
were O
declassified O
after O
the O
passage O
of O
fifty B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
stated O
that O
the O
commanders O

the O
British B-NORP
army O
who O
prepared O
the O
plan O
believed O
the O
course O
of O
the O
Nile B-LOC
could O
be O
changed O
to O
cut O
off O
90 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
the O
water O
reaching O
the O
Egyptian B-NORP

This O
would O
damage O

would O
thereby O
destroy O

Abdel B-PERSON

According O

this O

it O

The O
document O
stated O
that O
the O
implementation O

the O

later O
abandoned O
because O
Britain B-GPE
feared O
it O
might O
backfire O
violently O
on O
the O

Also O
, O
those O

Another O
bloody O
message O
received O
by O
Lebanon B-GPE
with O
the O
assassination O

the O
young O

fighting O

the O
independence O

Industry O

who O
worked O
with O
the O
majority O
to O
reinstate O

and O
to O
put O
an O
end O
to O

How O
is O
it O
possible O
then O
for O
the O
Lebanese B-NORP
to O
accept O
not O
having O
an O
international O
court O
? O

And O
is O
it O
reasonable O
that O
these O
crimes O
occur O
and O
that O
the O
noble O
sons O
of O
Lebanon B-GPE
who O
fight O
for O
freedom O
and O
sovereignty O
continue O
to O
be O
eliminated O
one O
after O
the O
other O
, O
and O
that O
certain O
Arab B-NORP
countries O
still O
have O
reservations O
about O
the O
international O
court O

The O
targeting O
of O
the O
martyred O
minister O
who O
paid O
for O
his O
country O
's O
sovereignty O
with O
his O
life O
, O
is O
a O
message O
of O
intimidation O
from O
the O
criminals O
who O
have O
already O
assassinated O
former O
Prime O
Minister O
Rafik B-PERSON
Hariri I-PERSON

Jibran B-PERSON
Tueni I-PERSON

Samir B-PERSON
Kasir I-PERSON

George B-PERSON

They O
are O

the O
ones O
who O
tried O
to O
assassinate O
Minister O
Marwan B-PERSON
Hamadi I-PERSON
and O
his O
colleague O
May B-PERSON
Shidyaq I-PERSON
. O

The O
killers O
want O
to O
terrorize O
the O
Lebanese B-NORP
and O
spread O
fear O
and O
destabilization O
, O
at O
a O
time O
when O
the O
international O
court O
is O
approaching O
them O
and O
aims O
to O
expose O
the O
truth O
. O

Does O
Lebanon B-GPE
not O
have O
the O
right O
to O
set O
an O
example O
by O
punishing O
the O
murderers O
of O
its O
officials O
and O
its O
youth O
? O

All O
those O
who O
resist O
the O
establishment O
of O
an O
international O
court O
must O
see O
today O
that O
the O
reason O
for O
the O
assassination O
of O
Pierre B-PERSON
Gemayel I-PERSON
was O
to O
instigate O
a O
coup O
against O
those O
who O
want O
to O
liberate O
Lebanon B-GPE
and O
reinstate O
its O
sovereignty O
. O

And O
preventing O
the O
adoption O
of O
the O
international O
court O
is O
a O
response O
to O
the O
will O
of O
those O
murderers O
who O
want O
to O
eliminate O
Lebanon B-GPE
's O
youth O
and O
to O
all O
those O
who O
have O
a O
promising O
future O
in O
a O
sovereign O
and O
independent O
country O
. O

What O
is O
noticeable O
is O
that O
the O
murderers O
target O
the O
youth O
who O
have O
a O
role O
to O
play O
in O
the O
country O
's O
future O
and O
who O
follow O
the O
principles O
that O
Pierre B-PERSON
Gemayel I-PERSON
followed O
which O
are O
independence O
, O
boldness O
and O
courage O
. O

Lebanon B-GPE
is O
being O
subjected O
to O
destabilization O
and O
no O
state O

foreign O

the O
right O
