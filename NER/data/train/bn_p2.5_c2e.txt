that O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
is O
basically O
satisfied O
with O
the O
US B-GPE
attitude O
, O
or O
else O
it O

surely O
turned O
back O
again O
and O
left O
the O
negotiation O

of O
the O
six B-CARDINAL

tough O

very O
hard O
for O
the O
US B-GPE
to O

other O
issues O
with O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
. O

This O

But O
the O

said O
yesterday B-DATE
that O
if O
the O
US B-GPE
attempts O

use O
both O

soft O
tactics O
such O
as O
coupling O
dialogue O
with O
pressure O
and O
carrots O
with O
sticks O
in O
negotiations O
, O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
will O
surely O
counteract O
with O
dialogue O
and O
a O

really O
not O
an O
easy O
job O

. O

He O
did O
not O
want O
to O
predict O
whether O
the O
talks O
would O
be O
successful O
, O
saying O
that O
the O
US B-GPE
still O
thinks O
that O
the O

should O
be O

Just O

However O
, O
just O
the O

the O
OPEC B-ORG
crude O

production O
policy O
for O
the O
next O
stage O
. O

OPEC B-ORG
may O
decide O
to O
continue O
reducing O

, O
but O
the O
rate O
of O
reduction O
will O
depend O
on O
oil O
prices O
and O
levels O
of O
inventories O
. O

Daukoru B-PERSON
said O
that O
OPEC B-ORG
will O
try O
its O
best O
to O
maintain O
stability O
in O
oil O
production O
so O
as O
to O
balance O
the O
relationship O
between O
oil O
supply O
and O
demand O
. O

Saudi B-GPE
Arabia I-GPE
, O
the O
largest O
OPEC B-ORG
oil O
producing O
country O
, O
has O
always O
voted O
in O
favor O
of O
production O
reduction O
. O

However O
, O
Libya B-ORG
, O
Kuwait B-ORG
, O
and O
other O
member O
states O
believe O
that O
the O
current O
international O
oil O
price O
has O
been O
stabilized O
at O
above O
60 B-QUANTITY
US I-QUANTITY
dollars I-QUANTITY
per O
barrel O
, O
approaching O
the O
balance O
of O
market O
supply O
and O
demand O
. O

Under O
such O
circumstances O
, O
there O
is O
no O
need O
for O
OPEC B-ORG
to O
continue O
reducing O
production O
. O

In O
October B-DATE

this I-DATE

prices O
, O
OPEC B-ORG
held O
a O
special O
ministerial O
conference O

reduce O
daily O
oil O
output O
by O
1.2 B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL

starting O

November B-DATE
1 I-DATE

However O
, O
after O

was O
announced O
, O
it O
did O
not O
produce O
any O
significant O
effect O
on O
boosting O

prices O
, O
so O
there O
was O

In O
fact O
, O
ah O
, O
Chinese B-NORP
overseas O
students O
being O
cheated O
in O
Canada B-GPE
is O
not O
accidental O
. O

At O
the B-DATE
beginning I-DATE
of I-DATE
this I-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
uh O
, O
the B-ORG
Ontario I-ORG
Ministry I-ORG

Education I-ORG
revoked O
the O
licenses O
of O
five B-CARDINAL
private O
schools O
on O
the O
grounds O
of O
being O
found O
to O
have O
been O
falsifying O
and O
raising O
students O
' O
grades O
at O
will O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
the O
admission O
qualifications O
of O
Chinese B-NORP
overseas O
students O
who O
have O
ever O
studied O
at O
these O
schools O
have O
been O
revoked O
. O

Recently O
, O
uh O
, O
it O
has O
been O
again O
reported O
in O
the O
news O
that O
at O
another O
private O
college O
the O
students O
were O
unable O
to O
receive O
their O
degree O
certificates O
after O
four B-DATE
years I-DATE
of O
study O
. O

The O
Global B-ORG
Chinese I-ORG
Press I-ORG
has O
published O
an O
editorial O
on O
this O
series O
of O
events O
, O
saying O
why O
Chinese B-NORP
overseas O
students O
in O
Canada B-GPE
repeatedly O
get O
cheated O
. O

In O
the O
editorial O
, O
uh O
, O
it O
says O
there O
are O
several O
reasons O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
is O
, O
uh O
, O
that O
not O
enough O
attention O
is O
paid O
to O
the O
pre-warnings O
issued O
by O
the B-ORG
Chinese I-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
of I-ORG
Education I-ORG
for O
studying O
abroad O
. O

Second B-ORDINAL
is O
that O
some O
overseas O
students O
and O
parents O
lack O
a O
rational O
attitude O
, O
stepping O
onto O
the O
risky O
springboard O
, O
even O
when O
they O
know O
fully O
well O
that O
the O
schools O
have O
problems O
, O
but O
in O
order O
to O
get O
a O
visa O
and O
quickly O
emigrate O
. O

Third B-ORDINAL
, O
uh O
, O
is O
that O
the O
information O
for O
studying O
abroad O
has O
false O
and O
exaggerated O
elements O
that O
seriously O
mislead O
students O
. O

What O
is O
worth O
noting O
is O
, O
uh O
, O
that O
the O
Chinese B-LANGUAGE
and O
English B-LANGUAGE
versions O
of O
the O
webpages O
of O
many O
private O
schools O
are O
not O
the O
same O
. O

The O
English B-LANGUAGE
versions O
are O
relatively O
a O
little O
more O
honest O
, O
but O
the O
Chinese B-LANGUAGE
versions O
are O
given O
to O
exaggeration O
. O

Here O
, O
ah O
, O
we O
want O
to O
give O
a O
reminder O
to O
those O
students O
with O
dreams O
of O
studying O
abroad O
: O
you O
must O
think O
very O
carefully O
before O
you O
choose O
your O
school O
. O

As O

Iranian B-NORP
President O
Ahmadinejad B-PERSON
once O
said O
that O
he O
could O
not O
believe O
that O
the O
Holocaust B-EVENT
actually O
occurred O

But O
as O
for O
Iran B-GPE

nuclear O
issue O
, O
French B-NORP
Foreign O
Minister O
Douste B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Blazy I-PERSON
said O
powerful O
nations O
should O

as O
soon O
as O
possible O
; O
otherwise O
, O
the O
credibility O
of O
the B-ORG
United I-ORG

, O
he O
said O
that O
possessing O
nuclear O
technology O
is O
a O
right O
that O
all O
countries O
possess O
. O

Iran B-GPE
is O
opposed O
to O
any O
situation O
which O
limits O
the O
realization O
of O
this O
right O
for O
peaceful O
purposes O
. O

He O
also O
reiterated O
that O
sanctions O
would O
not O
be O
effective O
. O

Iran B-GPE
will O
continue O
with O
its O
nuclear O
program O
, O
but O
it O
does O
not O
intend O
to O
develop O
nuclear O

. O

Iran B-GPE
is O
also O
ready O
to O
negotiate O
with O
the O

He O
hopes O
that O

Recently O
, O
ah O
, O
there O
have O
been O
figures O
indicating O
, O
eh O
, O
that O
nationally O
4.13 B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
university O

graduated O
in O
2006 B-DATE

Of O
these O

million I-CARDINAL
plan O

Now O
there O

A O
job O

especially O
for O

has O
appeared O
in O
Beijing B-GPE

It O
was O
four B-TIME
in I-TIME
the I-TIME
afternoon I-TIME
when O
our O
reporter O
arrived O
at O
the O
hostel O
, O
but O
most O
of O
the O

were O
still O
elsewhere O
taking O

in O
job O

not O

However O
, O
one O
could O
already O
hear O
accents O
from O
all O
over O
the O
country O
. O

We O
wandered O
randomly O
through O
several O
guest O

discovered O
that O
most O
of O
the O
inhabitants O
were O
newly O

graduated O
university O
students O
from O
other O

had O

Taiyuan B-ORG

, O
because O

uh O
, O
so O
here O
, O
there O
is O
quite O
a O
lot O
of O
information O
here O
. O

We O
are O
all O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL

The O
light O
is O
out O
at O
11 B-TIME
PM I-TIME
, O
actually O
just O
like O
in O
a O
dormitory O

At O
the O
job O

, O
you O
can O
see O

The O

they O
also O
point O
out O
the O

The O
person O
in O

the O
hostel O
explained O
that O
currently O
there O
are O
about O
two B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL

forty I-CARDINAL

odd O

here O

the O

At O

the O

A O
major O
road O
accident O
occurred O
in O
the B-GPE
Meili I-GPE
District I-GPE
of O
Tainan B-GPE
on O
the O
3rd B-ORDINAL
, O
killing O
twenty B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
people O
. O

The O
initial O
assessment O
by O
the O
police O
is O
that O
the O
accident O
was O
caused O
by O
a O
brake O
malfunction O
and O
a O
burst O
rear O
- O
right O
tire O
. O

who O
was O
in O
charge O
of O
the O
operation O
of O
the O
tour O
bus O
, O
has O
been O
detained O
. O

Inspectors O
from O
Tainan B-GPE
went O
to O
the O
scene O
of O
the O
accident O
on O
the O
4th B-ORDINAL
to O
investigate O
the O
cause O
of O
the O
accident O
. O

Based O
on O
a O
preliminary O
assessment O
of O
the O
skid O
marks O
reaching O
forty B-QUANTITY
meters I-QUANTITY
in O
length O
that O
were O
left O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
the O
accident O
was O
probably O
the O
result O
of O
a O
brake O
malfunction O
and O
a O
burst O
rear O
right O
tire O
that O
caused O
a O
loss O
of O
control O
over O
the O
vehicle O
body O
. O

Another O
investigator O
said O
that O
excessive O
speed O
leading O
to O
a O
loss O
of O
control O
as O
the O
vehicle O
involved O
in O
the O
accident O
descended O
the O
slope O
could O
also O
possibly O
have O
been O
a O
factor O
. O

The O
inspectors O
also O
discovered O
during O
the O
investigation O
that O
the O
driver O
was O
possibly O
driving O
without O
a O
license O
. O

Taiwanese B-NORP
media O
reported O
that O
, O
according O
to O
regulations O
, O
the O
families O
of O
those O
killed O
in O
the O
vehicle O
accident O
can O
collect O
a O
settlement O
of O
NT$ B-MONEY
2.5 I-MONEY
million I-MONEY
to O
NT$ B-MONEY
9 I-MONEY
million I-MONEY
. O

But O
because O
the O
driver O
was O
driving O
without O
a O
license O
, O
it O
is O
very O
possible O
that O
the O
settlement O
funds O
will O
not O
be O
given O
. O

However O
, O
the B-ORG
Kaohsiung I-ORG
municipal I-ORG
government I-ORG
will O
give O
the O
families O
of O

that O

the O

President O

also O
put O

ninety B-CARDINAL

seven I-CARDINAL

The O
report O
says O
that O
the O
situation O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
is O
extremely O
severe O
and O
is O
still O
deteriorating O
day O
by O
day O
. O

It O
recommends O
a O
major O
revision O
of O
US B-GPE
strategy O
toward O
the B-EVENT
Iraq I-EVENT
war I-EVENT
. O

At O
a O
press O

held O
on O
the B-DATE

, O
the O
members O

the O

also O
admitted O
that O
although O
the O
report O
provides O
the B-ORG
US I-ORG
government I-ORG
comprehensive O
and O
in-depth O
recommendations O
, O
due O
to O
the O
extremely O
complicated O
nature O
of O
the O
situation O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
, O
the O
report O
itself O
is O
not O
a O
cure O
- O
all O
for O
all O
problems O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
research O
group O
does O
not O
propose O
in O
the O
report O
an O
actual O
timetable O
for O
troop O
withdrawal O
, O
but O
it O
nevertheless O
recommends O
that O
the O
US B-GPE
military O
withdraw O
almost O
all O
combat O
troops O
before O
the B-DATE
beginning I-DATE
of I-DATE
2008 I-DATE
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
task O
of O
the O
troops O
that O
stay O
behind O
should O
also O
be O
shifted O
from O
fighting O
to O
support O

The O
report O
warned O
the B-ORG
Bush I-ORG
government I-ORG
that O
it O
should O
not O
make O
an O
open O

ended O
commitment O

urged O
Bush B-PERSON
not O
to O
hesitate O
to O
use O

as O
a O
means O
to O
force O
the B-ORG
Iraqi I-ORG
government I-ORG
to O
improve O
the O
security O
situation O
. O

It O
's O
close B-DATE
to I-DATE
year I-DATE
end I-DATE
, O
and O
car O

have O
one B-CARDINAL

In O
Beijing B-GPE

, O
the O

levels O
of O
some O
medium O

even O
reached O
as O
much O
as O
30,000 B-QUANTITY

Compared O
to O
the O

, O
it O
is O
neither O

Like O

only O
92,800 B-QUANTITY

A O

in O

, O
this O

sold O
two B-CARDINAL
Honda B-ORG

. O

Considering O
the O
prices O
, O
uh O
, O
people O
feel O
that O
a O
discount O
of O
over O
20,000 B-QUANTITY
Yuan I-QUANTITY
in O
this O
period O
is O
quite O
appropriate O
. O

It O
is O
understood O
that O
till O
now O
, O
over O
50 B-CARDINAL
car O
models O
with O
domestic O
brands O
have O
reduced O
their O
prices O
at O
the O

time O

Among O
these O
, O
the O
reduction O
rate O
is O
larger O
for O
smaller O

in O

to O
receive O
higher O

the O

will O
all O

This O

The B-ORG

Iraq I-ORG
Study I-ORG

report O
on O
the O
6th B-ORDINAL
made O
79 B-CARDINAL
recommendations O
to O
the B-ORG
Bush I-ORG
administration I-ORG
on O
its O
Iraq B-GPE
policy O
. O

There O
are O
two B-CARDINAL
key O
recommendations O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
is O
to O
urge O
the B-ORG
Bush I-ORG
administration I-ORG
to O
launch O
a O
new O
diplomatic O
offensive O
in O
the B-LOC
Middle I-LOC
East I-LOC
and O
Gulf O
, O
in O
particular O
, O
to O
hold O
talks O
with O
Iran B-GPE
and O
Syria B-GPE
on O
the O
resolution O
to O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
sectarian O
conflicts O
. O

The O
second B-ORDINAL
is O
to O
change O
the O
primary O
tasks O
of O
the O
US B-GPE
military O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
and O
gradually O
withdraw O
the O
military O
from O
Iraq B-GPE
if O
conditions O
permit O
. O

This O
study O
report O
says O
the O
situation O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
is O
very O
grave O
and O
deteriorating O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
very O
careful O
in O
wording O
when O
making O
proposals O
and O
appears O
ambiguous O
at O
critical O
points O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
report O
even O
just O
briefly O
touches O
on O
military O
withdrawal O
, O
an O
issue O
of O
the O
most O
concern O
. O

If O
nothing O
unexpected O
will O
have O
happened O
in O
the O
security O
situation O
by O
March B-DATE
2008 I-DATE
, O
the O
primary O
task O
of O
the O
US B-GPE
military O
in O
Iraq O
should O
be O
shifted O
to O
supporting O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
military O
that O
assumes O
main O
military O
operations O
. O

All O
the O
unnecessary O
combat O
troops O
will O
leave O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

Some O
analyses O
think O
that O
this O
shows O
, O
on O
one O
hand O
, O
that O
the O
study O
group O
did O
not O
want O
to O
confront O
the B-ORG
Bush I-ORG
administration I-ORG
on O
this O
key O
and O
sensitive O
issue O
of O
military O
withdrawal O
, O
and O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
it O
also O
shows O
that O
amidst O
the O

both O

An O

the O

have O
resulted O
in O
the O
deaths O
of O
more O
than O
five O
thousand O
gorillas O
in O
West B-LOC
Africa I-LOC
. O

Further O
hunting O
will O
be O
sufficient O
to O
lead O
to O
the O
extinction O
of O
the O
gorilla O
if O
mankind O
does O
not O
stop O
. O

The O

And O
in O
the O
recently O
published O
scientific O
journal O
, O
an O
article O
by O
an O
international O
expert O
team O
says O
that O
the O
ebola O

is O
spreading O
among O
gorilla O
groups O
and O
its O
speed O
is O
clearly O
faster O
than O
the O

He O
says O

only O

the O

a B-CARDINAL

of O
the O

the O

. O

This O
is O
a O
extremely O
shocking O
figure O
. O

He O
also O
said O
that O
taking O
into O
account O
the O
commercial O
hunting O
, O
the O
gorillas O
might O
face O
extinction O
very O
soon O
. O

Walsh O
also O
said O
gorilla O
groups O
share O
territory O
. O

The O
feces O
of O
an O
infected O
gorilla O
can O
fairly O
easily O
infect O
other O

Furthermore O
, O
chimpanzees O

gorillas O
will O
touch O
any O

This O
is O
also O
the O
path O

We O
not O

In O

colorful O

The O

in O

Through O

We O

a O
solid O

the O

For O
many O
overseas O

, O
becoming O
a O
citizen O
is O
a O
matter O
of O
great O
concern O
. O

And O
passing O
the O
citizenship O
examination O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
hurdles O
they O
must O
overcome O
. O

Recently O
, O
ah O
, O
the B-ORG
U.S. I-ORG
Citizenship I-ORG
and I-ORG
Immigration I-ORG
Services I-ORG
has O
changed O
the O
format O
of O
their O
citizenship O
exams O
. O

This O
decision O
has O
increased O
the O
difficulties O
of O
Chinese B-NORP
becoming O
U.S. B-GPE
citizens O
, O
and O
has O
resulted O
in O
quite O
some O
repercussions O
among O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
community O
. O

Let O
us O
look O
at O
a O
report O
from O
the O
American B-NORP
Chinese B-LANGUAGE
- O
language O
television O
. O

After O
the B-ORG
U.S. I-ORG
Citizenship I-ORG
and I-ORG
Immigration I-ORG
Services I-ORG
announced O
the O
questions O
for O
the O
new O
citizenship O
exam O
, O
there O
were O
mixed O
reactions O
within O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
communities O
, O
in O
particular O
from O
some O
of O
the O
elderly O
who O
wished O
to O
become O
citizens O
. O

Some O
felt O
that O
it O
would O
be O
more O
difficult O
to O
become O
naturalized O
citizens O
from O
now O
on O
. O

Some O
citizenship O
classes O
are O
also O
forced O
to O
update O
their O
existing O
curricula O
. O

It O
is O
generally O
believed O
that O
the O
revised O
naturalization O
questions O
will O
increase O
the O
difficulty O
of O
the O
exam O
. O

Currently O
, O
most O
of O
the O
questions O
only O
require O
simple O
answers O
to O
be O
satisfactory O
. O

However O
, O
from O
the O
known O
portions O
of O
the O
new O
exam O
questions O
, O
future O
exams O
will O
assess O
naturalization O
applicants O
' O
knowledge O
in O
areas O
like O
American B-NORP
social O
and O
political O
history O
; O
and O
applicants O
need O
to O
extend O
and O
elaborate O
their O
answers O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
current O
applicants O
only O
need O
to O
know O
that O
the O
structure O
of O
the B-ORG
U.S. I-ORG
government I-ORG
is O
a O
separation O
of O
powers O
among O
the O
legislative O
, O
executive O
, O
and O
judicial O
branches O
, O
but O
future O
applicants O
will O
need O
to O
answer O
why O
there O
is O
a O
need O
for O
such O
a O
separation O
of O
powers O
. O

So O
for O
those O
who O
do O
not O
have O
a O
good O
command O
of O
English B-LANGUAGE
, O
they O
will O
usually O
find O
it O
more O
difficult O
. O

Last B-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
a O
Beijing B-GPE
company O
was O
found O
guilty O
of O
buying O
and O
selling O
on O
speculation O
because O
it O
sold O
land O
on O
the B-LOC
moon I-LOC
. O

This B-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
ah O
, O
they O
also O
planned O
to O
sell O
World B-EVENT
Cup I-EVENT
air O
, O
but O
eh O
, O
did O
not O
receive O
a O
business O
permit O
. O

Because O
of O
this O
, O
eh O
, O
they O
recently O
launched O
a O
lawsuit O
against O
the O
industry O
and O
commerce O
department O
. O

The O
lawsuit O
however O
was O
rejected O
by O
the O
court O
. O

The O
plaintiff O
in O
this O
case O
is O
the O
same O
company O
that O
was O
investigated O
and O
penalized O
by O
the O
industry O
and O
commerce O
agency O
in O
October B-DATE
last I-DATE
year I-DATE
for O
selling O
land O
on O
the B-LOC
moon I-LOC
. O

According O
to O
its O
person O
in O
charge O
, O
the O
company O
planned O
to O
sell O
World B-EVENT
Cup I-EVENT
air O
during O
the O
present O
World B-EVENT
Cup I-EVENT
. O

However O
, O
the B-ORG
Industry I-ORG
and I-ORG
Commerce I-ORG
Administration I-ORG
of I-ORG
Beijing I-ORG
's I-ORG
Chaoyang I-ORG
District I-ORG
ordered O
publicly O
a O
halt O
to O
the O
sales O
. O

The O
plaintiff O
felt O
that O
the O
World B-EVENT
Cup I-EVENT
air O
had O
been O
imported O
after O
being O
collected O
and O
individually O
packed O
in O
Germany B-GPE
and O
that O
because O
it O
had O
value O
and O
usage O
value O
, O
it O
constituted O
a O
commercial O
product O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
there O
is O
currently O
no O
law O
or O
regulation O
that O
prohibits O
the O
sale O
of O
air O
, O
therefore O
the O
confiscation O
of O
the O
plaintiff O
's O
business O
permit O
by O
the O
Industry O
and O
Commerce O
Administration O
was O
not O
legal O
. O

But O
the O
accused O
claimed O
that O
the O
plaintiff O
's O
request O
that O
special O
air O
from O
specific O
regions O
be O
added O
as O
an O
item O
to O
the O
company O
's O
business O
scope O
did O
not O
come O
under O
the O
scope O
established O
by O
the O
national O
economy O
categorization O
standards O
. O

It O
was O
also O
vague O
, O
meaning O
there O
was O
no O
way O
to O
carry O
out O
effective O
supervision O
according O
to O
industry O
standards O
, O
so O
the O
notice O
of O
rejection O
of O
registration O
was O
not O
improper O
. O

The O
court O
, O
in O
hearing O
the O
case O
, O
felt O
that O
according O
to O
the O
administrative O
regulations O
on O
company O
registration O
, O
the O
plaintiff O
's O
application O
to O
sell O
special O
air O
from O
specific O
regions O
could O
not O
be O
supervised O
under O
the O
national O
economy O
industry O
categorization O
standards O
. O

The O
rejection O
of O
the O
plaintiff O
's O
registration O
application O
by O
the B-ORG
Administration I-ORG
of I-ORG
Industry I-ORG
and I-ORG
Commerce I-ORG
of I-ORG
Chaoyang I-ORG
District I-ORG
complied O
with O
laws O
and O
regulations O
and O
would O
help O
maintain O
order O
in O
the O
country O
's O
market O
economy O
, O
and O
so O
the O
court O
rendered O
the O
above O
judgment O
. O

Yes O
, O
although O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
topics O
will O
be O
discussed O
at O
this B-EVENT
NATO I-EVENT
summit I-EVENT
, O
general O
public O
attention O
will O
be O
focused O
on O
: O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
NATO B-ORG
's O
eastward O
expansion O
and O
its O
relations O
with O
Russia B-GPE
, O
and O

, O
NATO B-ORG

strategy O
in O
expanding O
its O
functions O
and O
powers O
in O
the B-DATE
21st I-DATE

. O

Then O
, O
this B-EVENT
NATO I-EVENT
summit I-EVENT
, O
eh O
, O
is O
being O
held O
at O
the O
doorsteps O
of O
Russia B-GPE
, O
in O
the O
capital O
of O
Latvia B-GPE
, O
eh O
, O
er O
, O
Riga B-GPE
; O
this O
is O
also O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
that O
such O
a O
summit O
is O
being O
held O
in O
an O
Eastern B-NORP
European I-NORP
country O
, O
and O
that O
itself O
is O
provocative O
for O
Moscow B-GPE
. O

In O
order O
to O
avoid O
provoking O
Russia B-GPE
, O
eh O
, O
the B-EVENT
NATO I-EVENT
summit I-EVENT
may O
not O
directly O
announce O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
batch O
of O
countries O
covered O
in O
the O
eastward O
expansion O
; O
but O
indeed O
, O
Macedonia B-GPE
, O
Albania B-GPE
, O
and O
Azerbaijan B-GPE
, O
er O
, O
even O
, O
eh O
, O
Ukraine B-GPE
and O
Georgia B-GPE
, O
which O
are O
in O
tense O
relations O
with O
Russia B-GPE
, O
are O
all O
listed O
in O
the O
next O
batch O
of O
development O
. O

And O
NATO O
hopes O
to O
work O
more O
closely O
with O
Asia B-NORP
- I-NORP
Pacific I-NORP
countries O
such O
as O
Japan B-GPE
, O
South B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
, O
and O
Australia B-GPE
; O
and O
this O
makes O
it O
more O
puzzling O
as O
to O
how O
NATO B-ORG
is O
defining O
the O
scope O
and O
breadth O
of O
its O
future O
global O
partnership O
strategies O
. O

Also O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
counter-terrorism O
and O
peacekeeping O
, O
eh O
, O
NATO B-ORG
also O
intended O
to O
place O
resources O
and O
energy O
security O
, O
as O
well O
as O
computer O
networks O
protection O
, O
into O
its O
scope O
of O
responsibilities O
in O
its O
new O
21st B-DATE
century I-DATE
strategies O
. O

This O
means O
that O
in O
the O
future O
, O
the O
reasons O
for O
NATO B-ORG
's O
global O
military O
actions O
and O
other O
excuses O
, O
eh O
, O
to O
intervene O
in O
situations O
will O
all O
substantially O
increase O
. O

NATO B-ORG
's O
desire O
and O
goal O
to O
move O
from O
regional O
to O
global O
, O
eh O
, O
and O
from O
passive O
defense O
to O
active O
attack O
is O
now O
also O
becoming O
increasingly O
clear O
and O
evident O
. O

At O

During O

the O

continued O
to O
employ O

bringing O
up O

called O

and O
asking O

But O
the O

but O
from O

they O

As O

The O

cited O

Under O
the O

the O

Lawyers O
can O

But O
the O

continued O
to O

on O
this O

demanding O

who O
sternly O
demanded O
that O
the O

of O
so O
- O
called O

again O
. O

During O
the O
trial O

the O

also O
produced O
more O

Iran B-GPE
and O
Syria B-GPE

Recently O
, O
er O
, O
Interpol B-ORG
, O
ah O
, O
has O
been O
focusing O
a O
lot O
of O
attention O
on O
, O
ah O
, O
this O
affair O
of O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
, O
er O
, O
counterfeiting O

Well O
, O
they O
say O
, O
er O
, O
that O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
, O
er O
, O
is O
now O
producing O

this O
, O
a O
kind O
of O

with O
a O

value O
of O
100 B-MONEY
US I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
, O
which O
is O
called O
a O
super O
fake O

The O
so O
- O
called O
super O
fake O
note O
means O
it O
has O
an O
extremely O
high O
accuracy O
in O
copying O

We O
can O
have O
a O
look O
. O

At O
the O
top O
is O
a O
real O

and O
at O
the O
bottom O
is O
a O
fake O
note O
. O

But O
with O
a O
naked O
eye O
like O
ours O
, O
%pw O
, O
it O
is O
at O
this O
distance O
we O
ca O
n't O
see O
that O
there O
's O
any O
difference O
. O

In O
a O
word O
, O
this O
kind O
of O
fake O
note O
, O
uh O
, O
really O
is O
%pw O
, O
extremely O
accomplished O
. O

Normal O
people O
, O
uh O
, O
could O
hardly O
tell O
the O
difference O
. O

So O
, O
now O
, O
er O
, O
the B-ORG
US I-ORG
Treasury I-ORG
Department I-ORG
has O
brought O
out O
an O
announcement O
, O
saying O
that O
ah O
, O
the O

, O
ah O
, O
produced O

the O
agreement O
of O
the O
government O
, O
and O
under O
the O
management O
and O
control O
of O

So O
, O
they O
have O
so O
far O
, O
er O
, O
discovered O
in O
total O
that O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE

It O
was O
because O

this O

, O
uh O
, O
that O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
at O
that O
time O
boycotted O

Regarding O

Korean B-ORG

released O
an O
editorial O
yesterday B-DATE

In O
this O
editorial O
, O
it O
mentioned O
, O
uh O
, O
saying O
that O
the O
entire O
international O
community O
is O
earnestly O
anticipating O
that O
the B-EVENT
six I-EVENT
party I-EVENT
talks I-EVENT
could O
resume O
. O

Japan B-GPE
is O
the O
only O
exception O
. O

Among O
these O
, O
uh O
, O
it O
also O
accused O
, O
saying O
that O
Japan B-GPE
intended O
to O
sabotage O
the B-EVENT
six I-EVENT
party I-EVENT
talks I-EVENT
, O
so O
as O
to O
prevent O
the O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
nuclear O
issue O
from O
being O
fairly O
resolved O
. O

Prior O
to O
the O
holding O
of O
six B-EVENT
party I-EVENT
talks I-EVENT
on O
the O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
nuclear O
issue O
, O
uh O
, O
Japan B-GPE
requested O
that O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
must O
abandon O
its O
nuclear O
program O
and O
meanwhile O
, O
must O
also O
resolve O
the O
hostage O
issue O
between O
Japan B-GPE
and O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
. O

This O
editorial O
believed O
, O
saying O
that O
, O
ah O
, O
this O
, O
uh O
, O
actually O
had O
poisoned O
the O
negotiation O
atmosphere O
of O
the B-EVENT
six I-EVENT
- I-EVENT
party I-EVENT
talks I-EVENT
. O

Well O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
uh O
, O
this O
editorial O
, O
uh O
, O
also O
believed O
, O
saying O
that O
the O
hostage O
issue O
and O
the O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
nuclear O
issue O
were O
in O
fact O
two B-CARDINAL
totally O
unrelated O
issues O
, O
so O
it O
did O
not O
make O
any O
sense O
that O
Japan B-GPE
raised O
this O
issue O
. O

It O
also O
denounced O
the O
earlier O
speech O
, O
uh O
, O
by O
er O
, O
Japanese B-NORP
Foreign O
Minister O
Taro B-PERSON
Aso I-PERSON
. O

Taro B-PERSON
Aso I-PERSON
proposed O
at O
an O
earlier O
time O
, O
saying O
that O
, O
uh O
, O
Japan B-GPE
would O
not O
accept O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
as O
a O
nuclear O
country O
returning O
to O
the O
negotiation O
table O
, O
meanwhile O
, O
uh O
, O
also O
requesting O
that O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
must O
dismantle O
its O
nuclear O
weapons O
. O

Well O
, O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
US B-GPE
, O
uh O
, O
if O
it O
did O
not O
change O
its O
position O
, O
this O
editorial O
also O
said O
, O
it O
would O
then O
be O
impossible O
to O
hold O
the B-EVENT
six I-EVENT
- I-EVENT
party I-EVENT
talks I-EVENT
on O
the O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
nuclear O
issue O
in O
December B-DATE
, O
nor O
would O
it O
be O
possible O
in O
the O
future O
unless O
the O
US B-GPE
changed O
its O
position O
. O

Given O
Iran B-GPE
's O
refusal O
to O
suspend O
its O
uranium O
enrichment O
activities O
, O
three B-CARDINAL
countries O
-- O
France B-GPE
, O
Britain B-GPE
and O
Germany B-GPE
-- O
with O
the O
support O
of O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
, O
circulated O
a O
draft O
resolution O
on O
sanctions O
against O
Iran B-GPE
at O
the B-ORG
UN I-ORG
Security I-ORG
Council I-ORG
on O
the O
8th B-ORDINAL
, O
in O
which O
, O
it O
suggested O
a O
sanction O
against O
the O
12 B-CARDINAL
Iranians B-NORP
suspected O
of O
involvement O
in O
the O
nuclear O
program O
. O

However O
, O
according O
to O
a O
U.S. B-GPE
Washington B-ORG
Post I-ORG
report O
on O
the O
11th B-ORDINAL
, O
the O
list O
of O
Iranians B-NORP
provided O
by O
the B-ORG
U.S. I-ORG
State I-ORG
Department I-ORG
was O
actually O
obtained O
from O
an O
Internet O
search O
. O

Even O
the O
U.S. B-ORG
Central I-ORG
Intelligence I-ORG
Agency I-ORG
had O
doubts O
about O
its O
accuracy O
. O

According O
to O
insider O
sources O
cited O
by O
the B-ORG
Washington I-ORG
Post I-ORG
, O
the O
CIA B-ORG
felt O
that O
the O
U.S B-GPE
. O
had O
committed O
major O
mistakes O
in O
its O
intelligence O
provided O
to O
the B-ORG
UN I-ORG
Security I-ORG
Council I-ORG
prior O
to O
the B-EVENT
Iraq I-EVENT
War I-EVENT
, O
hence O
they O
could O
not O
afford O
to O
make O
another O
mistake O
on O
the O
Iranian B-NORP
issue O
, O
and O
therefore O
refused O
to O
provide O
the O
list O
to O
the B-ORG
State I-ORG
Department I-ORG
. O

The B-ORG
State I-ORG
Department I-ORG
had O
no O
choice O
but O
to O
assign O
a O
junior O
official O
to O
search O
for O
the O
names O
online O
. O

After O
entering O
a O
few O
keywords O
, O
such O
as O
Iran B-GPE
nuclear O
program O
and O
others O
, O
this O
official O
selected O
12 B-CARDINAL
names O
with O
the O
highest O
hit O
rate O
, O
and O
finally O
wrote O
them O
into O
the O
Security B-ORG
Council I-ORG
draft O
resolution O
. O

The O
draft O
clearly O
pointed O
out O
that O
these O
12 B-CARDINAL
people O
ought O
to O
be O
sanctioned O
, O
including O
placing O
a O
ban O
on O
their O
international O
travels O
and O
participation O
in O
international O
business O
activities O
. O

According O
to O
reports O
, O
related O
CIA B-ORG
officials O
said O
none O
of O
the O
people O
mentioned O
on O
the O
list O
were O
directly O
related O
to O
Iran B-GPE
's O
secret O
nuclear O
program O
. O

But O
the B-ORG
U.S. I-ORG
State I-ORG
Department I-ORG
still O
included O
this O
list O
obtained O
from O
an O
Internet O
search O
in O
the O
UN B-ORG
Security I-ORG
Council I-ORG
draft O
resolution O
submitted O
by O
France B-GPE
, O
Germany B-GPE
, O
and O
Britain B-GPE
. O

This O
will O
greatly O
weaken O
the O
persuasiveness O
of O
the O
draft O
. O

The O

the O

on O
the O

This O

the O

the O
meeting O
lasted O
five B-TIME

Regarding O
the O
content O
of O
the O
talks O
, O
eh O
, O
we O
speculate O
, O
eh O
, O
that O
it O
was O
probably O
on O
a O
few O
particular O
issues O
, O
including O
among O
them O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE

demand O
that O

the O

the B-ORG
Banco I-ORG
Delta I-ORG
Asia I-ORG

Besides O
this O
, O
eh O
, O
it O
also O
wants O
an O
end O
to O
the O
freeze O
on O
the O
American B-NORP
assets O
of O
eight O
North B-NORP
Korean I-NORP
companies O
. O

Will O
the O
US B-GPE
agree O
or O
concede O
to O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
's I-GPE
demands O
? O

We O
still O
have O
no O
idea O
about O
this O
, O
but O
the O
US B-GPE
could O
possibly O
acknowledge O
that O
North B-GPE

suggests O
that O
the B-ORG
White I-ORG

open O

with O
Iran B-GPE

, O
which O

the O

recently O
conducted O
a O
random O

the O
quality O

The O
result O

, O
nearly O
40 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
plastic O
cutting O
boards O
products O
may O
contain O
harmful O
substances O
. O

The O
random O
quality O
inspection O
of O
this O
time O
mainly O
involved O
the O
thirteen B-CARDINAL
batches O
of O
plastic O
wrap O
for O
food O
packaging O
and O
cutting O
boards O
manufactured O
by O
twelve B-CARDINAL
companies O
in O
Zhejiang B-GPE
Province O
. O

The O
pass O
rate O
of O
the O
random O
inspection O
is O
61.5 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
. O

A O
total O
of O
five B-CARDINAL
batches O
of O
the O
products O
failed O
to O
pass O
, O
of O
which O
three B-CARDINAL
batches O
are O
plastic O
cutting O
boards O
. O

The O
main O
existing O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
residue O
after O
evaporation O
exceeds O
the O
limit O
. O

According O
to O
the O
information O
, O
the O
residue O
after O
evaporation O
refers O
to O
the O
chemical O
substances O
possibly O
produced O
by O
plastic O
products O
when O
coming O
into O
contact O
with O
water O
, O
vinegar O
, O
oil O
, O
and O
other O
liquids O
during O
use O
. O

These O
chemical O
substances O
are O
often O
harmful O
to O
the O
human O
body O
. O

Some O
individual O
production O
enterprises O
add O
excessive O
amounts O
of O
talc O
, O
calcium O
carbonate O
, O
and O
other O
substances O
into O
their O
products O
in O
order O
to O
increase O
the O
hardness O
of O
the O
plastic O
cutting O
boards O
. O

This O
is O
the O
main O
reason O
resulting O
in O
the O
failure O
of O
these O
products O
to O
pass O
. O

Experts O
suggest O
that O
when O
shopping O
for O
a O
plastic O
cutting O
board O
, O
choose O
the O
plastic O
cutting O
board O
that O
is O
evenly O
colored O
and O
has O
no O
impurities O
or O
pungent O
smell O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
during O
use O
, O
it O
is O
best O
not O
to O
use O
it O
to O
cut O
very O
hot O
food O
because O
high O
temperature O
will O
accelerate O
the O
decomposition O
of O
harmful O
chemical O
substances O
so O
that O
they O
will O
enter O
the O
food O
and O
affect O
people O

health O
