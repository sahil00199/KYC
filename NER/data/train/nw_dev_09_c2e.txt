Lavrov O
said O
, O
" O
Our O
principle O
conditions O
are O
the O
freezing O

The O
approach O
of O
the O
Iran O

is O
that O
Iran O
should O
suspend O

the O

of O
the O

" O

Lavrov O
said O
after O

there O

anything O

It O
's O
necessary O

explain O
to O

the O
advantages O
it O
would O
receive O

discussed O
in O

Western O
powers O
worry O
that O
Iran O
plans O
to O
use O
the O

. O

However O
, O
Iran O
insists O
the O

is O
for O
peaceful O
use O
and O
is O
aimed O
at O
providing O
electricity O
to O
a O
constantly O
growing O
population O
. O

The O
six O
nations O
have O
steadily O
sought O
to O
persuade O
Iran O
to O
suspend O
its O
nuclear O
program O
by O
means O
of O
a O
number O
of O

They O
both O
had O
the O

aspiration O
when O
they O
grew O
up O

which O
was O
to O

Under O

a O
lot O

They O
strongly O

Huang O

The O

not O
plan O
on O

However O
, O
she O
went O
to O
see O
the O
hospital O
leaders O
on O
her O
own O
initiative O
and O
firmly O
requested O

Zhang O

When O
she O

she O
immediately O
wrote O
a O

for O
a O

and O
made O
a O
strong O
request O
to O
join O
the O
field O

Since O
the O
time O
was O
tight O
when O
she O
was O
sent O
to O
the O
front O
, O
she O
did O
not O
even O
take O
into O

of O
saying O

to O
her O

The O
traditional O
life O
of O
a O
government O
employee O
, O
epitomized O
in O
the O
saying O
" O
drinking O
tea O
and O
smoking O
cigarettes O
, O
reading O
newspapers O
most O
of O
the O
day O
" O
has O
become O
history O
. O

In O
2007 O
, O
the O
first O
website O
focusing O
on O
the O
psychological O
health O
of O
civil O
servants O
in O
China O
conducted O
a O
survey O
questionnaire O
of O
government O
employees O
in O
Longwan O
District O
in O
the O
city O
of O
Wenzhou O
regarding O
their O
physical O
and O
psychological O
health O
and O
career O
mentality O
. O

The O
results O
indicate O
that O
50 O
% O
of O
respondents O
regard O
their O
work O
as O
mechanical O
and O
feel O
" O
tired O
both O
physically O
and O
psychologically O
, O
" O
40 O
% O
feel O
markedly O
tired O
, O
and O
only O
10 O

Earlier O
, O
a O
survey O
conducted O
for O
The O
Report O
on O
the O
Development O
of O
Youth O
and O
Teenagers O
in O
Guangdong O
Province O
showed O
that O
, O
among O

, O
50.3 O

, O
31.2 O

and O
1.6 O
% O
even O
consider O

Through O
interviews O
, O
the O
reporter O
has O
learned O
that O
a O
depressive O
psychology O
is O
dominant O
among O
civil O
servants O
. O

The O
administrative O
authority O
system O
of O
the O
government O
demands O
a O
high O
degree O
of O
obedience O
, O
and O
the O
mechanical O
work O
routines O
tend O
to O
make O
individualistic O
personalities O
feel O
helpless O
and O
depressed O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
anxiety O
caused O
by O
a O
fear O
of O
" O
being O
criticized O
by O
superiors O
" O
and O
the O
mechanical O
" O
excessive O
workload O
" O
often O
make O
them O
feel O
impatient O
; O
tension O
over O
interpersonal O
relations O
and O
the O
psychological O
imbalance O
resulting O
from O
unfair O
distribution O
are O
also O
sources O
of O
pressure O
. O

Originally O
, O
the O
torch O
relay O
is O
a O
grand O
sports O
event O
in O
which O
people O
in O
the O
world O
share O
peace O
and O
happiness O
. O

It O
should O
show O
the O
hope O

that O
the O
Olympic O

brings O
to O
people O
to O
the O
world O
in O
a O
peaceful O
and O
auspicious O
atmosphere O
. O

However O
, O
it O
was O
used O
by O
anti-Chinese O
force O
as O
an O
opportunity O
to O
attempt O
to O
shame O
China O
. O

Western O
mainstream O
media O
used O
a O
series O
of O
reports O
that O
distorted O
the O
facts O
, O
took O
out O
of O
the O
context O
, O
and O
confused O
one O
thing O
with O
another O
. O

Some O
people O
even O
prevented O
the O
torch O
relay O
unscrupulously O
. O

This O
led O
to O
widespread O
condemnation O
in O
the O
world O
. O

Chinese O
around O
the O
world O
even O
stirred O
up O
huge O
patriotic O
fervor O
and O
enthusiasm O
in O
supporting O
the O
Beijing O
Olympics O
. O

Wherever O
the O

There O
was O

a O
considerable O

of O
Chinese O
who O
did O
not O
hesitate O
to O
trudge O
a O
long O
distance O
for O
over O
10 O
hours O
. O

They O
either O
braved O

went O
against O
the O

, O
or O
were O
not O

A O
common O
problem O
faced O
by O
implementing O
information O
disclosure O
provisions O
by O
local O
governments O
is O
how O
does O
a O
government O
deal O
with O
applications O
for O
information O
disclosure O
; O
in O
particular O
, O
how O
to O
give O
appropriate O
responses O
to O
different O
applications O
. O

Two O
tasks O
in O
Shanghai O
have O
given O
constructive O
meaning O
and O
effect O
in O
promoting O
standardization O
of O
open O
work O
. O
First O
, O
there O
is O
the O
production O
of O
a O
" O
flowchart O
of O
application O
for O
government O
information O
disclosure O
" O
. O

The O
chart O
makes O
the O
entire O
application O
process O
clear O
at O
a O
glance O
, O
greatly O
enhancing O
reasonable O
expectations O
of O
parties O
concerned O
and O
administrative O
organs O
on O
application O
procedures O
. O

Second O
, O
the O
annual O
report O
of O
Shanghai O
has O
distinguished O
standards O
for O
government O
agencies O
in O
refusing O
to O
provide O
government O
information O
, O
including O
non O
- O
" O
prescribed O
" O
government O
information O
, O
nonexistent O
information O
, O
information O
not O
controlled O
by O
the O
department O
, O
unclear O
application O
, O
area O
of O
disclosure O
exempted O
by O
Article O
Ten O
of O
the O
provision O
, O
and O
other O
reasons O
. O

If O
the O
requirements O
of O
information O
disclosure O
are O
understood O
mechanically O
, O
it O
will O
only O
lead O
executive O
authorities O
to O
refuse O
disclosure O
applications O
only O
based O
on O
exceptions O
-LRB- O
that O
is O
Article O
Ten O
-RRB- O
specified O
by O
the O
disclosure O
provisions O
. O

However O
, O
Shanghai O
takes O
into O
account O
the O
complexity O
of O
the O
actual O
situation O
, O
cites O
other O
reasons O
, O
and O
makes O
it O
public O
through O
its O
annual O
report O
. O

This O
provides O
the O
basis O
for O
further O
study O
and O
improving O
provisions O
on O
information O
disclosure O
, O
and O
it O
also O
makes O
applicants O
have O
better O
expectations O
on O
their O
applications O
. O

these O

were O
generally O

The O
research O
results O
showed O
that O
after O
the O
G6PC2 O
gene O
becomes O
modified O
, O
it O
can O
disturb O
the O
activities O
of O
glucokinase O
, O
which O
is O
responsible O
for O
regulating O
and O
controlling O
the O
body O
's O
blood O
sugar O
level O
and O
, O
as O
a O
result O
, O
cause O
the O
blood O
sugar O
level O
to O
go O
" O
out O
of O
control O
" O
and O
increase O
to O
a O
" O
dangerous O
level O
. O
" O

Under O

circumstances O
, O
glucokinase O
acts O
as O
a O
" O
monitor O
, O
" O
strictly O
monitoring O

controlling O
blood O
sugar O
levels O
. O

It O
can O
send O
signals O
to O
the O
body O

beta O

; O
the O
beta O
cells O
will O
then O
secrete O

and O
keep O
the O
body O

level O
within O
a O

range O
at O

Once O
glucokinase O
becomes O
" O
paralyzed O
, O
" O
the O
person O

blood O

level O
will O
increase O
, O
and O
the O
risk O

will O
also O
increase O
. O

Scientists O
said O
that O
polymorphisms O
within O
the O
G6PC2 O
gene O
can O
probably O
increase O
blood O
sugar O
level O
by O
approximately O
5 O
% O
. O

This O
percentage O
does O
not O
appear O

is O
