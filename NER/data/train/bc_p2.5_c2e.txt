Today B-DATE
since O
we O
came O
we O
've O
been O
talking O
about O
this O
phrase O
domestic O
brand O
, O
ah O
, O
but O
what O
exactly O
does O
it O
mean O
. O

Because O
we O
also O
know O
that O
actually O
the O
engines O
in O
some O
models O
of O
Chery B-ORG
are O
not O
made O
by O
the O
company O
itself O
, O
so O
how O
do O
we O
explain O
domestic O
brand O
. O

Domestic O
brand O
, O
eh O
, O
actually O
is O
just O
what O
the O
name O
implies O
, O
eh O
, O
this O
, O
it O
's O
our O
own O
baby O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

That O
is O
, O
the O
baby O
son O
is O
not O
adopted O
, O
but O
our O
very O
own O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Well O
, O
your O
own O
baby O
's O
arms O
and O
legs O
can O
be O
bought O
from O
other O
people O
and O
put O
on O
. O

so O
, O
eh O
, O
among O
these O
kinds O
of O
domestic O
brands O
, O
there O
is O
still O
some O
distance O
between O
the O
complete O
brand O
and O
the O
product O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Because O
the O
brand O
, O
eh O
, O
it O
incorporates O
the O
product O
, O
ah O
, O
incorporates O
the O
company O
, O
ah O
, O
incorporates O
a O
lot O
of O
content O
, O
and O
includes O
its O
denotation O
and O
its O
connotation O
, O
many O
emotional O
things O
, O
while O
the O
product O
itself O
, O
eh O
, O
is O
an O
expression O
of O
the O
brand O
, O
ah O
. O

Yeah O
. O

So O
, O
how O
should O
we O
view O
this O
part O
of O
the O
product O
. O

We O
think O
that O
, O
eh O
, O
it O
is O
exactly O
, O
eh O
, O
in O
the O
process O
of O
independent O
innovation O
, O
then O
, O
we O
ca O
n't O
completely O
cut O
ourselves O
off O
from O
the O
outside O
world O
. O

Because O
, O
for O
example O
, O
at O
present O
, O
we O
are O
still O
using O
some O
chips O
from O
abroad O
as O
some O
of O
our O
chips O
in O
computers O
. O

So O
this O
entire O
process O
is O
a O
process O
of O
how O
to O
transform O
the O
main O
parts O
and O
the O
core O
parts O
by O
phases O
. O

First B-ORDINAL
we O
must O
have O
our O
own O
brands O
, O
first B-ORDINAL
we O
must O
have O
the O
main O
part O
of O
our O
own O
product O
. O

Then O
we O
must O
gradually O
, O
step O
by O
step O
perfect O
the O
core O
part O
, O
eh O
, O
through O
, O
step O
by O
step O
, O
importation O
, O
digesting O
and O
absorbing O
. O

Yeah O
. O

You O
'll O
take O
the O
university O
- O
entrance O
exam O
in O
three B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

That O
's O
the O
way O
we O
do O
it O
. O

I O
will O
prepare O
to O
test O
into O
Harvard B-ORG
. O

Um O
. O

I O
will O
. O

If O
Harvard B-ORG
does O
n't O
come O
through O
, O
I O
'll O
take O
the O
test O
to O
get O
into O
Yale B-ORG
. O

many O
parents O
set O
goals O
for O
their O
children O
, O
or O
maybe O
they O
do O
n't O
set O
a O
goal O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

however O
, O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
developing O
based O
on O
this O
kind O
of O
pace O
, O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
get O
into O
university O
in O
three B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

He O
can O
only O
try O
to O
get O
into O
a O
liberal O
arts O
university O
. O

He O
does O
n't O
need O
to O
study O
physics O
or O
chemistry O
. O

He O
needs O
the O
three O
subjects O
of O
Chinese B-LANGUAGE
, O
English B-LANGUAGE
and O
math O
, O
together O
with O
politics O
, O
history O
and O
geography O
, O
and O
that O
's O
it O
. O

Small O
children O
, O
if O
their O
foundation O
in O
Chinese B-LANGUAGE
is O
sufficient O
, O
see O
, O
should O
n't O
have O
any O
problem O
with O
a O
middle O
- O
school O
level O
of O
politics O
, O
history O
and O
geography O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
we O
are O
only O
missing O
a O
math O
course O
. O

So O
, O
the O
foundation O
in O
Chinese B-LANGUAGE
can O
produce O
, O
the O
excellent O
state O
of O
the O
four O
subjects O
of O
Chinese B-LANGUAGE
, O
politics O
, O
history O
and O
geography O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
his O
English B-LANGUAGE
is O
pretty O
good O
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
we O
will O
make O
up O
one B-DATE
year I-DATE
of O
math O
, O
and O
it O
is O
possible O
, O
because O
there O
is O
a O
precedent O
, O
Zhang B-PERSON
Qinghong I-PERSON
. O

That O
commitment O
-- O
whatever O
should O
be O
committed O
has O
all O
been O
committed O
. O

Now O
they O
should O
enter O
the O
phase O
of O
actions O
. O

I O
remember O
that O
at O
the O
first O
phase O
of O
the O
fifth B-ORDINAL
round O
of O
six B-QUANTITY
party O
talks O
, O
we O
had O
already O
talked O
about O
that O
if O
the O
six B-QUANTITY
party O
talks O
were O
to O
be O
resumed O
, O
they O
should O
start O
discussing O
, O
that O
is O
, O
a O
concrete O
plan O
, O
that O
is O
, O
how O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
implementation O
by O
phases O
. O

However O
, O
even O
till O
now O
we O
do O
n't O
seem O
to O
have O
seen O
such O
a O
plan O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

The O
South B-NORP
Korean I-NORP
side O
has O
always O
had O
this O
difficulty O
, O
that O
is O
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
action O
to O
action O
deal O
. O

It O
said O
, O
you O
take O
an O
action O
, O
and O
I O
will O
take O
an O
action O
. O

Then O
strictly O
based O
on O
the O
time O
limit O
, O
starting O
from O
today O
, O
let O
's O
say O
: O
Get O
ready O
, O
Go O
! O

Uh-huh O
. O

Or O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
if O
you O
want O
to O
do O
it O
like O
this O
, O
this O
, O
this O
process O
of O
nuclear O
abandonment O
will O
be O
too O
long O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
way O
we O
can O
wait O
. O

Right O
. O

So O
South B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
proposed O
this O
so O
- O
called O
package O
deal O
, O
putting O
many O
things O
into O
one O
phase O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Well O
, O
this O
entire O
phase O
is O
considered O
one B-QUANTITY
thing O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

So O
, O
from O
a O
comprehensive O
view O
, O
this O
phase O
may O
have O
four B-QUANTITY
things O
together O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Ah O
, O
then O
after O
these O
are O
about O
all O
finished O
, O
this O
phase O
will O
be O
over O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

So O
, O
this O
is O
a O
response O
approach O
, O
rather O
than O
some O
sort O
of O
action O
to O
action O
deal O
for O
each O
and O
every O
specific O
matter O
. O

But O
this O
report O
, O
other O
than O
the O
ten O
people O
doing O
the O
investigation O
, O
do O
you O
feel O
that O
the O
report O
is O
a O
sufficient O
reflection O
of O
the O
current O
Iraq B-GPE
situation O
. O

Is O
it O
adequate O
. O

Um O
, O
in O
reality O
, O
that O
is O
the O
responsibility O
of O
the O
ten B-QUANTITY
people O
was O
to O
investigate O
the O
development O
of O
the O
state O
of O
affairs O
in O
the O
Iraq B-GPE
situation O
up O
to O
the O
situation O
as O
it O
currently O
stands O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

But O
in O
the O
end O
, O
we O
finally O
see O
that O
some O
of O
these O
ten B-QUANTITY
people O
just O
went O
through O
the O
motions O
somewhat O
. O

Like O
Rice B-PERSON
, O
Rice B-PERSON
herself O
, O
she O
, O
um O
, O
took O
over O
as O
secretary O
of O
state O
quite O
late O
, O
so O
she O
is O
not O
to O
blame O
for O
very O
much O
. O

The O
one O
who O
is O
most O
to O
blame O
is O
still O
the O
person O
who O
was O
in O
charge O
of O
the O
intelligence O
agencies O
at O
the O
time O
. O

Right O
. O

And O
the O
most O
responsible O
, O
the O
number O
one O
person O
to O
blame O
, O
eh O
, O
should O
be O
the O
defense O
secretary O
, O
that O
Rumsfeld B-PERSON
. O

He O
decided O
the O
post-war O
reestablishment O
of O
order O
. O

He O
ordered O
the O
disbanding O
of O
the O
Iraq B-GPE
military O
and O
ordered O
that O
the B-ORG
Baath I-ORG
Party I-ORG
be O
declared O
illegal O
. O

It O
was O
him O
who O
persuaded O
President O
Bush B-PERSON
to O
make O
this O
momentous O
strategic O
decision O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

So O
I O
feel O
that O
with O
regard O
to O
final O
responsibility O
he O
is O
probably O
the O
most O
to O
blame O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Um O
, O
after O
an O
eight B-DATE
- I-DATE
month I-DATE
investigation O
this O
ten B-QUANTITY
- O
person O
group O
, O
in O
the O
end O
, O
eh O
, O
has O
submitted O
such O
a O
report O
that O
contains O
seventy B-QUANTITY
- I-QUANTITY
nine I-QUANTITY
recommendations O
. O

Uh O
, O
ordinarily O
, O
eh O
, O
as O
, O
this O
, O
leader O
, O
Baker B-PERSON
is O
the O
head O
of O
this O
group O
. O

Well O
, O
he O
, O
eh O
, O
is O
also O
an O
old O
family O
friend O
of O
the O
Bush B-PERSON
clan O
. O

Normally O
, O
nothing O
will O
take O
place O
that O
will O
embarrass O
the O
Bush B-PERSON
clan O
or O
President O
Bush B-PERSON
himself O
, O
but O
we O
noticed O
, O
that O
there O
were O
still O
three O
major O
discords O
in O
the O
report O
, O
eh O
. O

So O
what O
is O
the O
ultimate O
that O
can O
be O
done O
to O
apprehend O
bicycle O
thieves O
. O

Then O
you O
will O
make O
the O
number O
of O
thieves O
caught O
, O
eh O
, O
into O
an O
unexpected O
number O
, O
or O
one O
of O
the O
highest O
. O

Oh O
. O

This O
is O
what O
I O
think O
. O

You O
arrested O
more O
than O
700 B-QUANTITY
people O
within O
three B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

630-something B-QUANTITY
. O

Bicycle O
theft O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
is O
so O
serious O
, O
ha O
, O
someone O
said O
this O
has O
a O
lot O
to O
do O
with O
the O
especially O
prosperous O
used O
bicycle O
market O
, O
eh O
, O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
. O

Getting O
to O
the O
bottom O
of O
it O
, O
ah O
, O
when O
you O
arrest O
the O
people O
who O
purchase O
and O
sell O
the O
stolen O
bicycles O
, O
they O
would O
say O
that O
if O
nobody O
buys O
them O
, O
why O
would O
I O
bother O
selling O
. O

Is O
n't O
that O
right O
. O

Around O
areas O
near O
some O
university O
campuses O
, O
eh O
, O
there O
are O
rows O
of O
, O
eh O
, O
these O
bicycle O
bazaars O
, O
selling O
used O
bicycles O
. O

So O
are O
n't O
college O
students O
buying O
too O
. O

Yes O
. O

So O
are O
n't O
we O
Beijing B-GPE
citizens O
also O
buying O
. O

These O
days O
, O
eh O
, O
the O
central O
authorities O
are O
, O
eh O
, O
proposing O
to O
improve O
the O
quality O
of O
all O
citizens O
, O
I O
think O
this O
is O
the O
key O
. O

Yes O
. O

So O
the O
crux O
of O
the O
problem O
does O
not O
lie O
with O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
- O
hand O
market O
, O
right O
. O

If O
we O
do O
not O
buy O
them O
, O
then O
is O
n't O
it O
true O
that O
there O
is O
no O
such O
problem O
. O

Well O
, O
this O
time O
, O
I O
think O
there O
were O
a O
few O
prominent O
features O
, O
uh O
, O
about O
new O
technologies O
. O

One O
, O
eh O
, O
was O
what O
is O
called O
TSI O
, O
which O
was O
brought O
on O
this O
occasion O
. O

This O
type O
is O
called O
a O
dual O
- O
charging O
engine O
. O

The O
use O
of O
such O
a O
dual O
- O
charging O
engine O
, O
eh O
, O
is O
its O
general O
use O
in O
products O
, O
I O
feel O
this O
is O
a O
change O
this O
time O
. O

Looking O
at O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
one O
, O
eh O
, O
it O
is O
the O
hybrid O
vehicles O
this O
time O
, O

As O
for O
the O
hybrid O
motors O
, O
ah O
, O
this O
time O
I O
observed O
that O
it O
was O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
generation O
hybrid O
motors O
that O
had O
been O
put O
in O
the O
products O
, O
ah O
. O

Well O
hybrid O
cars O
have O
n't O
sold O
very O
well O
in O
China B-GPE
, O
it O
seems O
. O

Um O
, O
it O
's O
just O
getting O
started O
. O

Uh O
, O
I O
feel O
it O
just O
got O
going O
, O
so O
we O
ca O
n't O
say O
they O
have O
n't O
sold O
well O
. O

Anything O
in O
its O
initial O
stage O
, O
to O
say O
that O
its O
sales O
are O
very O
low O
, O
that O
its O
buyers O
are O
few O
, O
that O
is O
, O
to O
say O
that O
it O
is O
n't O
selling O
well O
does O
n't O
really O
have O
much O
meaning O
. O

This O
, O
now O
is O
not O
the O
summer O
when O
the O
watermelons O
will O
be O
harvested O
, O
or O
the O
time O
for O
eating O
watermelons O
, O
right O
. O

After O
measuring O
the O
current O
market O
, O
to O
say O
, O
How O
many O
watermelons O
did O
you O
sell O
today O
on O
your O
stand O
here O
. O

This O
, O
this O
is O
a O
watermelon O
that O
the O
aristocracy O
and O
rich O
want O
to O
eat O
. O

At O
this O
time O
, O
we O
ca O
n't O
come O
to O
the O
assessment O
that O
the O
watermelons O
are O
n't O
selling O
well O
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
watermelons O
are O
being O
prepared O
for O
the O
summer O
. O

Hey O
, O
it O
is O
not O
that O
it O
is O
n't O
time O
yet O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
we O
discovered O
some O
law O
breakers O
were O
purposely O
driving O
military O
vehicles O
, O
using O
military O
vehicles O
as O
a O
cover O
, O
ah O
, O
for O
committing O
serious O
criminal O
offenses O
. O

For O
example O
, O
some O
were O
driving O
the O
vehicles O
to O
commit O
robberies O
, O
and O
driving O
the O
vehicles O
to O
commit O
blackmail O
and O
extortion O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

And O
it O
once O
happened O
that O
, O
er O
, O
a O
law O
breaker O
displayed O
a O
stolen O
military O
license O
plate O
on O
his O
vehicle O
, O
er O
, O
and O
brazenly O
kidnapped O
a O
young O
woman O
, O
er O
, O
and O
raped O
her O
. O

Ah O
, O
this O
created O
an O
extremely O
bad O
impression O
on O
the O
society O
. O

Uh O
, O
if O
, O
er O
, O
the O
public O
were O
to O
judge O
this O
only O
from O
the O
license O
plate O
, O
they O
would O
think O
this O
was O
the O
military O
. O

Yeah O
. O

Right O
. O

Right O
, O
that O
soldiers O
did O
it O
. O

So O
it O
seriously O
damaged O
the O
image O
and O
reputation O
of O
the O
military O
. O

Not O
long O
ago O
, O
on O
an O
expressway O
, O
er O
, O
our O
traffic O
police O
discovered O
a O
fake O
military O
vehicle O
in O
the O
course O
of O
their O
duties O
. O

As O
he O
was O
investigated O
, O
eh O
, O
the O
law O
breakers O
in O
this O
fake O
military O
vehicle O
boldly O
kidnapped O
the O
traffic O
police O
officer O
into O
the O
vehicle O
, O
drove O
from O
Hunan B-GPE
all O
the O
way O
to O
Henan B-GPE
, O
then O
, O
er O
, O
pushed O
the O
traffic O
police O
officer O
out O
of O
the O
vehicle O
, O
then O
fled O
again O
in O
the O
vehicle O
. O

Uh O
. O

So O
, O
it O
's O
extremely O
nasty O
in O
nature O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
the O
addiction O
of O
young O
people O
to O
the O
Internet O
, O
it O
has O
not O
been O
a O
matter O
of O
just O
one O
or O
two O
days O
that O
we O
talked O
about O
it O
. O

For O
example O
, O
many O
people O
know O
about O
the O
case O
of O
a O
child O
in O
Tianjin B-GPE
known O
as O
Zhang B-PERSON
Xiaoyi I-PERSON
; O
he O
was O
finally O
extremely O
addicted O
to O
the O
Internet O
, O
which O
in O
turn O
tormented O
him O
such O
that O
he O
chose O
to O
resist O
it O
by O
ending O
his O
own O
life O
. O

Because O
in O
our O
China B-GPE
, O
there O
is O
a O
very O
high O
rate O
of O
Internet O
addiction O
, O
as O
high O
as O
13 B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
. O

Yes O
. O

Among O
young O
people O
these O
days O
, O
there O
are O
13 B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
of O
them O
suffering O
from O
this O
kind O
of O
Internet O
addiction O
. O

Yes O
, O
high O
. O

nearly O
10 B-QUANTITY
million I-QUANTITY
children O
with O
Internet O
addiction O
quit O
school O
and O
stay O
at O
home O
. O

Oh O
. O

Why O
exactly O
are O
children O
attracted O
. O

Well O
, O
you O
will O
find O
that O
behind O
each O
Internet O
addicted O
child O
, O
there O
is O
a O
very O
distorted O
family O
story O
. O

That O
is O
to O
say O
, O
in O
order O
to O
sever O
this O
Internet O
addiction O
, O
is O
n't O
the O
best O
way O
to O
help O
them O
find O
an O
effective O
way O
to O
communicate O
with O
the O
real O
world O
. O

You O
are O
absolutely O
right O
. O

In O
fact O
regarding O
the O
management O
of O
Internet O
cafes O
, O
we O
have O
clear O
administrative O
regulations O
, O
such O
as O
prohibiting O
minors O
below O
the O
age O
of O
18 B-TIME
from O
entering O
. O

But O
there O
are O
still O
some O
people O
who O
turn O
a O
blind O
eye O
to O
it O
, O
so O
some O
places O
should O
have O
this O
kind O
of O
business O
ethics O
. O

Yes O
. O

Also O
-- O

I O
think O
, O
for O
some O
businesses O
, O
they O
should O
not O
just O
think O
of O
making O
money O
. O

That O
's O
right O
. O

The O
state O
should O
enhance O
its O
management O
of O
businesses O
such O
as O
Internet O
cafes O
, O
and O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
is O
to O
help O
these O
children O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
Internet O
addiction O
, O
and O
this O
should O
start O
from O
the O
adults O
around O
these O
children O
. O

The O
problem O
of O
getting O
rid O
of O
Internet O
addiction O
is O
not O
something O
raised O
for O
the O
kids O
, O
but O
for O
the O
entire O
society O
. O

What O
kind O
of O
penalties O
ought O
to O
be O
given O
for O
making O
and O
selling O
, O
er O
, O
fake O
vehicle O
license O
plates O
and O
for O
using O
fake O
vehicle O
license O
plates O
. O

It O
's O
like O
this O
, O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
People I-ORG
's I-ORG
Court I-ORG
the B-DATE
year I-DATE
before I-DATE
last I-DATE
approved O
another O
interpretation O
of O
the O
law O
: O
for O
all O
illegal O
production O
, O
buying O
or O
selling O
of O
the O
vehicle O
license O
plates O
of O
high O
- O
level O
official O
departments O
at O
the O
army O
headquarters O
level O
or O
higher O
, O
the O
transaction O
of O
one B-QUANTITY
plate O
is O
enough O
to O
constitute O
criminal O
activity O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Er O
, O
buying O
or O
selling O
three B-QUANTITY
or I-QUANTITY
more I-QUANTITY
other O
license O
plates O
constitutes O
criminal O
activity O
, O
ah O
. O

What O
level O
of O
sentencing O
might O
the O
most O
serious O
receive O
. O

Er O
, O
for O
general O
buying O
and O
selling O
transactions O
, O
it O
's O
a O
prison O
sentence O
of O
, O
er O
, O
less B-DATE
than I-DATE
three I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Er O
, O
serious O
cases O
could O
get O
three B-DATE
to I-DATE
ten I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

And O
for O
those O
who O
use O
them O
. O

If O
it O
's O
, O
er O
, O
an O
ordinary O
case O
of O
putting O
on O
military O
vehicle O
license O
plates O
, O
er O
, O
er O
, O
after O
the O
use O
of O
the O
fake O
military O
vehicle O
in O
operation O
discovered O
by O
the O
army O
headquarters O
level O
law O
enforcement O
department O
, O
the O
vehicle O
will O
be O
detained O
first O
. O

If O
your O
vehicle O
came O
from O
a O
legitimate O
source O
, O
er O
, O
you O
bought O
it O
yourself O
properly O
, O
and O
putting O
on O
the O
military O
license O
plate O
was O
just O
eh O
, O
to O
make O
your O
operations O
easier O
, O
that O
kind O
of O
thing O
, O
eh O
, O
then O
after O
some O
penalties O
are O
decided O
, O
the O
vehicle O
will O
still O
be O
returned O
to O
you O
in O
the O
future O
. O

supposing O
your O
vehicle O
is O
a O
stolen O
vehicle O
or O
a O
smuggled O
vehicle O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
legal O
paperwork O
, O
then O
the O
vehicle O
will O
be O
, O
er O
, O
confiscated O
. O

Er O
, O
generally O
speaking O
, O
uh O
, O
this O
is O
just O
to O
make O
the O
drivers O
of O
fake O
military O
vehicles O
pay O
the O
price O
. O

But O
-- O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
's O
precisely O
because O
the O
price O
of O
driving O
a O
fake O
military O
vehicle O
is O
too O
small O
. O

Right O
, O
it O
is O
too O
small O
. O

In O
the O
current O
law O
it O
's O
dealt O
with O
a O
little O
lightly O
. O

According O
to O
transport O
laws O
, O
eh O
, O
the O
maximum O
is O
a O
2,000 B-MONEY
- I-MONEY
yuan I-MONEY
fine O
. O

This O
is O
obviously O
a O
rather O
light O
punishment O
. O

So O
we O
want O
to O
further O
increase O
, O
um O
, O
the O
power O
of O
, O
um O
, O
law O
enforcement O
. O

Teacher O
Wang B-PERSON
, O
during O
the O
reporter O
's O
interview O
, O
Mr. O
Pan B-PERSON
repeatedly O
mentioned O
there O
is O
a O
priority O
purchase O
right O
. O

Legally O
, O
what O
is O
the O
concept O
of O
a O
priority O
purchase O
right O
. O

Then O
, O
the O
concept O
of O
a O
priority O
purchase O
right O
as O
applied O
to O
a O
lessee O
works O
like O
this O
, O
in O
a O
housing O
rental O
transaction O
, O
when O
the O
renter O
wants O
to O
sell O
his O
rented O
, O
this O
, O
house O
to O
a O
third B-ORDINAL
party O
, O
the O
lessee O
has O
the O
priority O
to O
purchase O
the O
house O
under O
similar O
conditions O
. O

Yes O
. O

Yes O
. O

Right O
. O

For O
example O
the O
two B-QUANTITY
of O
us O
. O

Oh O
. O

Right O
. O

The O
two B-QUANTITY
of O
us O
. O

I O
rent O
a O
house O
from O
you O
. O

Right O
. O

Yes O
, O
now O
you O
want O
to O
sell O
it O
. O

I O
want O
to O
sell O
, O
I O
want O
to O
sell O
to O
another O
person O
. O

Right O
. O

500,000 B-QUANTITY
. O

OK O
. O

Then O
now O
you O
say O
, O
for O
500,000 B-QUANTITY
I O
am O
also O
willing O
to O
purchase O
. O

Yes O
, O
yes O
, O
yes O
. O

Under O
these O
circumstances O
and O
under O
similar O
conditions O
, O
I O
must O
sell O
the O
house O
to O
you O
, O
that O
is O
, O
you O
as O
the O
lessee O
. O

Yes O
, O
yes O
, O
yes O
, O
yes O
. O

This O
is O
your O
priority O
purchase O
right O
as O
the O
lessee O
. O

Therefore O
, O
Mr. O
Pan B-PERSON
should O
have O
this O
priority O
purchase O
right O
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
Mr. O
Pan B-PERSON
is O
a O
legal O
lessee O
; O
therefore O
, O
according O
to O
article B-LAW
230 I-LAW
of I-LAW
the I-LAW
contract I-LAW
law I-LAW
, O
he O
certainly O
has O
such O
a O
priority O
of O
purchase O
right O
. O

Yes O
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
through O
this O
auto O
show O
, O
can O
you O
also O
just O
offer O
us O
a O
vision O
, O
for O
example O
, O
which O
other O
areas O
should O
be O
given O
attention O
and O
which O
areas O
should O
be O
strengthened O
, O
for O
future O
development O
of O
our O
, O
um O
, O
own O
brands O
and O
own O
technologies O
. O

If O
China B-GPE
's O
domestic O
companies O
, O
including O
our O
own O
brands O
, O
want O
to O
be O
, O
ah O
, O
able O
to O
establish O
themselves O
in O
the O
market O
with O
a O
competitive O
edge O
, O
and O
even O
to O
go O
global O
, O
what O
should O
we O
pay O
attention O
to O
. O

I O
think O
that O
, O
first O
, O
as O
far O
as O
our O
own O
brand O
products O
are O
concerned O
, O
the O
first O
thing O
is O
to O
be O
able O
to O
beat O
Japan B-GPE
and O
South B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
, O
ah O
. O

Our O
Chinese B-NORP
special O
features O
, O
ah O
, O
must O
be O
reflected O
in O
cost O
advantages O
. O

That O
is O
, O
we O
must O
have O
cost O
advantages O
over O
Japanese B-NORP
and O
South B-NORP
Korean I-NORP
products O
of O
20 B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
, O
ah O
, O
or O
in O
other O
words O
, O
the O
overall O
cost O
must O
be O
20 B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
lower O
than O
theirs O
. O

Can O
we O
do O
that O
. O

We O
should O
be O
able O
to O
do O
that O
. O

Objectively O
, O
as O
seen O
from O
our O
advantages O
, O
we O
should O
be O
able O
to O
do O
that O
. O

Just O
now O
we O
were O
primarily O
talking O
about O
those O
produced O
by O
counterfeiting O
, O
but O
which O
are O
the O
channels O
in O
which O
such O
vehicle O
license O
plates O
were O
generally O
stolen O
. O

Eh O
, O
in O
recent O
years O
, O
the O
theft O
of O
military O
license O
plates O
has O
been O
on O
an O
upward O
trend O
. O

As O
we O
all O
know O
, O
in O
2004 B-DATE
vehicles O
in O
our O
military O
changed O
to O
a O
new O
type O
of O
license O
plates O
. O

Over O
the O
past O
two B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
eh O
, O
large O
quantities O
of O
license O
plates O
were O
stolen O
from O
the O
military O
and O
the O
armed O
police O
, O
and O
the O
situation O
has O
become O
very O
serious O
. O

Some O
lawless O
individuals O
have O
seized O
on O
the O
theft O
of O
these O
military O
vehicle O
license O
plates O
as O
a O
road O
to O
fortune O
. O

Eh O
, O
in O
the O
past O
they O
pried O
and O
stole O
license O
plates O
from O
outside O
the O
barracks O
, O
but O
later O
it O
developed O
to O
a O
stage O
where O
they O
illegally O
climbed O
over O
the O
walls O
and O
entered O
the O
camps O
, O
in O
order O
to O
steal O
the O
license O
plates O
. O

Uh O
. O

Some O
even O
wear O
army O
uniforms O
to O
pass O
themselves O
off O
as O
soldiers O
, O
and O
enter O
and O
steal O
from O
the O
camps O
. O

Even O
worse O
, O
eh O
, O
some O
of O
them O
, O
er O
, O
would O
drill O
holes O
in O
the O
walls O
, O
sneak O
into O
the O
military O
garage O
, O
and O
steal O
a O
number O
of O
license O
plates O
all O
at O
once O
; O
there O
was O
one O
time O
where O
more O
than O
ten B-QUANTITY
plates O
were O
stolen O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Ai O
, O
it O
should O
be O
said O
that O
this O
has O
become O
very O
reckless O
. O

One O
situation O
is O
when O
a O
stolen O
or O
a O
counterfeit O
license O
plate O
is O
placed O
on O
a O
vehicle O
. O

It O
is O
said O
that O
, O
this O
, O
the O
vehicle O
does O
not O
correspond O
to O
the O
license O
plate O
. O

Are O
there O
any O
cases O
where O
the O
vehicle O
corresponds O
to O
the O
license O
plate O
, O
and O
yet O
at O
the O
same O
time O
should O
be O
included O
in O
the O
crack O
- O
down O
category O
, O
is O
there O
any O
situation O
like O
this O
. O

So O
long O
as O
the O
vehicles O
are O
not O
managed O
and O
categorized O
by O
the O
military O
, O
and O
if O
you O
use O
, O
eh O
, O
stolen O
military O
license O
plates O
without O
approval O
or O
produce O
military O
license O
plates O
illegally O
, O
eh O
, O
or O
even O
buy O
a O
military O
license O
plate O
for O
personal O
use O
, O
these O
are O
all O
cases O
of O
masquerading O
as O
military O
vehicles O
, O
and O
are O
all O
included O
within O
the O
crack O
- O
down O
category O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

But O
now O
, O
as O
for O
the O
various O
companies O
, O
they O
are O
competing O
against O
each O
other O
, O
ah O
, O
and O
it O
is O
really O
intense O
. O

It O
's O
extremely O
intense O
. O

Ah O
, O
they O
are O
competing O
and O
being O
good O
partners O
in O
cooperation O
as O
well O
, O
ah O
. O

Because O
they O
all O
, O
uh O
, O
want O
to O
work O
for O
China B-GPE
's O
automobile O
industry O
to O
make O
it O
large O
and O
strong O
, O
they O
are O
all O
full O
of O
suppressed O
energy O
, O
ah O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
if O
they O
want O
Chinese B-NORP
automobiles O
to O
be O
able O
to O
hold O
their O
own O
in O
the O
global O
automobile O
manufacturing O
industry O
, O
they O
will O
have O
to O
take O
the O
path O
, O
ah O
, O
of O
consolidation O
and O
restructuring O
. O

They O
have O
to O
form O
in O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
automobile O
industry O
two O
or O
three O
, O
uh O
, O
with O
large O
scale O
and O
with O
extremely O
competitive O
strength O
, O
uh O
, O
and O
possessing O
their O
own O
major O
brands O
, O
uh O
, O
a O
few O
groups O
like O
this O
, O
or O
what O
can O
be O
called O
a O
group O
army O
. O

You O
disclose O
such O
a O
piece O
of O
information O
. O

So O
in O
the O
future O
, O
as O
you O
say O
, O
these O
giant O
groups O
like O
the O
top O
group O
or O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
group O
, O
they O
could O
also O
swallow O
up O
the O
smaller O
fish O
in O
the O
pond O
and O
merge O
to O
form O
a O
few O
groups O
. O

Definitely O
. O

Definitely O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Oh O
. O

This O
, O
three B-QUANTITY
group O
armies O
, O
one B-QUANTITY
, O
two B-QUANTITY
, O
three B-QUANTITY
, O
the O
top O
ten B-QUANTITY
names O
definitely O
have O
to O
carry O
this O
out O
. O

Uh O
, O
I O
estimate O
that O
it O
will O
take O
place O
in O
the O
latter O
part O
of O
the O
eleventh B-ORDINAL
five B-TIME
year I-TIME
plan O
. O

In O
the O
twelfth B-ORDINAL
five B-DATE
year I-DATE
plan O
they O
will O
form O
an O
initial O
structure O
, O
forming O
such O
two B-QUANTITY
to O
three B-QUANTITY
large O
group O
armies O
. O

Starting O
from O
2006 B-DATE
and O
up O
until O
the O
present O
, O
no O
less O
than O
ten O
similar O
incidents O
have O
been O
reported O
in O
the O
media O
. O

Yes O
. O

Do O
we O
also O
need O
to O
consider O
, O
um O
, O
whether O
the O
department O
in O
question O
can O
use O
some O
method O
to O
protect O
drivers O
somewhat O
. O

Looking O
at O
it O
from O
the O
angle O
of O
the O
public O
transport O
companies O
, O
some O
, O
effective O
measures O
could O
be O
adopted O
, O
er O
, O
for O
example O
, O
a O
protective O
barrier O
system O
like O
that O
in O
taxis O
, O
right O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
, O
uh-huh O
, O
uh-huh O
. O

Installing O
buses O
with O
police O
alert O
systems O
could O
also O
be O
considered O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Once O
such O
an O
emergency O
arose O
, O

Buses O
are O
, O
um O
, O
a O
very O
, O
very O
important O
means O
of O
transportation O
in O
our O
lives O
. O

If O
we O
allow O
coldness O
and O
indifference O
to O
spread O
over O
this O
means O
of O
transportation O
, O
perhaps O
one O
day O
it O
will O
be O
our O
own O
health O
or O
safety O
that O
is O
threatened O
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
the O
department O
in O
question O
should O
build O
up O
beneficial O
measures O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
maybe O
we O
should O
all O
join O
together O
in O
building O
an O
atmosphere O
of O
mutual O
solicitude O
. O

If O
it O
was O
like O
that O
, O
such O
vicious O
violent O
incidents O
would O
surely O
not O
occur O
again O
in O
the O
public O
buses O
. O

You O
just O
talked O
about O
this O
, O
well O
, O
we O
are O
talking O
about O
this O
reason O
, O
ah O
. O

This O
reason O
is O
that O
ordinary O
people O
dare O
not O
spend O
money O
even O
if O
they O
have O
it O
, O
right O
. O

Yes O
. O

Well O
, O
there O
is O
an O
important O
reason O
here O
why O
they O
dare O
not O
spend O
money O
here O
when O
they O
have O
it O
, O
ah O

China B-GPE
's O
GDP O
has O
been O
climbing O
at O
such O
an O
annual O
rate O
of O
8 B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
, O
9 B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
, O
10 B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
, O
and O
this O
has O
been O
for O
twenty B-DATE
years I-DATE
already O
. O

Yes O
. O

Yes O
. O

But O
China B-GPE
's O
, O
this O
, O
wages O
, O
ah O
, O
within O
the O
total O
GDP O
amount O
, O
have O
been O
declining O
. O

Yes O
. O

The O
statistics O
, O
ah O
, O
it O
states O
that O
in O
1989 B-DATE
, O
ah O
, O
the O
total O
amount O
of O
China B-GPE
's O
wages O
accounted O
for O
16 B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
of O
GDP O
. O

Yes O
. O

Nearly O
twenty B-DATE
years I-DATE
later O
, O
it O
has O
declined O
to O
12 B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
. O

Yes O
. O

That B-PERCENT
12 I-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
of O
yours O
, O
ah O
, O
was O
actually O
the O
data O
in O
2004 B-DATE
. O

Uh O
. O

2004 O
. O

Right O
. O

Currently O
, O
the O
new O
data O
states O
that O
, O
this O
, O
the O
total O
amount O
of O
wages O
accounts O
for O
a O
bit O
over O
8 B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
of O
GDP O
. O

Ah O
. O

Well O
, O
that O
means O
you O
, O
this O
, O
are O
, O
um O
, O
relatively O
poor O
. O

Yes O
. O

Because O
as O
your O
, O
this O
, O
country O
's O
economic O
power O
rises O
, O
you O
ordinary O
people O
's O
gains O
have O
relatively O
decreased O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
ask O
you O
, O
where O
did O
the O
money O
go O
. O

Yes O
. O

Where O
did O
you O
spend O
the O
money O
. O

Well O
, O
, O
ah O
, O
if O
things O
go O
on O
like O
this O
, O
ah O
, O
the O
current O
situation O
uh O
plus O
inflation O
, O
ordinary O
people O
, O
ah O
, O
think O
, O
eh O
, O
that O
I O
must O
save O
my O
money O
to O
maintain O
my O
current O
livelihood O
, O
along O
with O
unforeseeable O
things O
in O
the O
future O
. O

Yes O
. O

Yes O
. O

This O
is O
why O
he O
saves O
more O
and O
more O
money O
, O
and O
increasingly O
dares O
not O
spend O
it O
. O

Because O
no O
matter O
how O
many O
more O
products O
you O
produce O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
have O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
me O
. O

Yes O
. O

ah O
, O
what O
we O
have O
just O
seen O
is O
an O
issue O
of O
domestic O
demand O
. O

China B-GPE
has O
not O
yet O
resolved O
the O
issue O
of O
domestic O
demand O
; O
the O
economy O
is O
not O
going O
to O
sustain O
developing O
. O

Right O
. O

In O
fact O
there O
are O
also O
many O
problems O
with O
external O
demand O
. O

From O
1995 B-DATE
, O
er O
, O
to O
the O
present O
, O
er O
, O
China B-GPE
has O
been O
the O
country O
with O
the O
largest O
number O
of O
anti-dumping O
charges O
worldwide O
, O
ah O
, O
for O
this O
eleven B-DATE
consecutive I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

Have O
you O
sent O
it O
. O

No O
. O

It O
has O
not O
yet O
now O
been O
sent O
. O

Why O
not O
. O

If O
sending O
it O
would O
win O
a O
prize O
then O
maybe O
. O

He O
said O
, O
you O
will O
get O
a O
notebook O
computer O
, O
if O
there O
is O
no O
notebook O
computer O
, O
I O
will O
not O
write O
such O
a O
thing O
. O

Then O
what O
is O
this O
theory O
of O
old O
- O
fashioned O
private O
school O
for O
, O
eh O
. O

This O
theory O
of O
old O
- O
fashioned O
private O
school O
is O
for O
you O
to O
read O
. O

Oh O
, O
for O
us O
to O
read O
. O

you O
wrote O
it O
even O
without O
the O
notebook O
computer O
, O
ah O
. O

If O
this O
is O
sent O
over O
there O
will O
be O
a O
notebook O
computer O
. O

Er O
. O

Will O
you O
send O
it O
. O

I O
'll O
send O
it O
after O
this O
program O
. O

Send O
it O
after O
this O
program O
. O

My O
goodness O
. O

You O
still O
have O
n't O
told O
me O
that O
specific O
ideal O
. O

You O
said O
that O
just O
now O
, O
and O
I O
already O
understood O
. O

Uh-huh O
, O
specifically O
, O
what O
do O
you O
want O
to O
be O
. O

Be O
a O
teacher O
, O
or O
be O
an O
author O
, O
what O
do O
you O
want O
to O
be O
. O

You O
need O
to O
have O
a O
specific O
career O
goal O
, O
do O
you O
have O
one O
. O

Actually O
, O
the O
dream O
is O
, O
leader O
. O

Ah O
. O

Leader O
. O

Leader O
. O

Want O
to O
be O
a O
leader O
. O

A O
leader O
. O

What O
kind O
of O
people O
can O
be O
classified O
as O
a O
leader O
. O

At O
what O
level O
can O
someone O
be O
considered O
a O
leader O
. O

Er O
, O
we O
should O
ask O
your O
program O
to O
make O
the O
guess O
on O
your O
own O
. O

Like O
Deng B-PERSON
Xiaoping I-PERSON
. O

Let O
us O
guess O
on O
our O
own O
. O

You O
at O
least O
have O
to O
tell O
us O
till O
which O
level O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
see O
from O
these O
books O
of O
yours O
, O
Deng B-PERSON
Xiaoping I-PERSON
, O
Nixon B-PERSON
, O
Confucius B-PERSON
, O
oh O
, O
they O
are O
all O
leaders O
. O

It O
must O
be O
so O
, O
there O
's O
also O
Chairman O
Mao B-PERSON
. O

Okay O
, O
let O
's O
begin O
again O
with O
South B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
. O

South B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
, O
eh O
, O
has O
been O
very O
energetic O
all O
along O
, O
so O
what O
does O
it O
hope O
to O
accomplish O
this O
time O
. O

South B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
has O
taken O
a O
relatively O
grim O
view O
of O
the O
current O
situation O
. O

Uh O
, O
today O
I O
saw O
the O
, O
um O
, O
speech O
by O
the O
head O
of O
the O
South B-NORP
Korean I-NORP
delegation O
at O
today O
's O
plenary O
meeting O
, O
ah O
. O

Well O
, O
there O
were O
a O
few O
points O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

The O
first B-ORDINAL
was O
that O
these O
talks O
must O
focus O
on O
the O
nuclear O
issue O
, O
that O
is O
, O
any O
issues O
like O
financial O
sanctions O
, O
ah O
, O
or O
kidnapping O
, O
ah O
, O
if O
they O
get O
mixed O
up O
together O
in O
the O
end O
, O
it O
might O
, O
eh O
, O
result O
in O
the O
talks O
leading O
to O
no O
positive O
result O
. O

What O
is O
its O
goal O
. O

It O
is O
that O
at O
the O
very O
least O
a O
concrete O
and O
detailed O
result O
must O
be O
reached O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

So O
to O
that O
effect O
, O
eh O
, O
it O
has O
put O
forward O
a O
set O
of O
proposals O
. O

And O
, O
in O
it O
, O
it O
has O
them O
broken O
down O
into O
interlinked O
, O
um O
, O
proposals O
for O
solving O
the O
issues O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
it O
supports O
the O
tentative O
idea O
proposed O
by O
China B-GPE
, O
that O
is O
, O
to O
set O
up O
within O
the B-ORG
Six I-ORG
Party I-ORG
Talks I-ORG
several O
special O
groups O
to O
discuss O
different O
issues O
. O

This O
would O
enable O
the O
progress O
of O
the O
talks O
, O
ah O
, O
to O
continue O
on O
unbroken O
. O

And O
not O
like O
now O
, O
when O
once O
it O
stops O
a B-DATE
year I-DATE
goes O
by O
. O

Well O
, O
five B-TIME
years I-TIME
having O
passed O
, O
how O
do O
you O
two O
experts O
appraise O
our O
, O
um O
, O
Chinese B-NORP
companies O
and O
foreign O
companies O
at O
present O
. O

What O
kind O
of O
description O
is O
applied O
to O
them O
. O

Can O
they O
still O
be O
described O
as O
wolves O
. O

Director O
Zhang B-PERSON
, O
what O
do O
you O
think O
. O

Er O
, O
I O
think O
it O
is O
like O
this O
. O

First B-ORDINAL
, O
I O
think O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
wolves O
as O
description O
and O
appraisal O
, O
is O
, O
I O
think O
, O
a O
very O
good O
appraisal O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Because O
after O
the O
wolves O
have O
arrived O
-- O
it O
actually O
describes O
a O
so O
- O
called O
arrival O
of O
the O
wolves O
, O
which O
is O
also O
the O
arrival O
of O
powerful O
competitors O
, O
right O
. O

So O
I O
think O
this O
appraisal O
is O
still O
quite O
good O
. O

Yeah O
. O

But O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
uh O
, O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
um O
, O
in O
the B-DATE
five I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
uh O
, O
following O
our O
accession O
to O
the O
WTO B-ORG
, O
we O
have O
been O
dancing O
with O
wolves O
. O

That O
is O
, O
since O
the O
wolves O
' O
arrival O
, O
uh O
, O
we O
have O
been O
actually O
adapting O
ourselves O
to O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
wolves O
while O
dancing O
with O
them O
, O
as O
well O
as O
growing O
bigger O
and O
more O
powerful O
ourselves O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Because O
I O
find O
, O
um O
, O
this O
very O
, O
er O
, O
interesting O
, O
and O
it O
also O
just O
occurred O
to O
me O
, O
that O
, O
a O
few O
days O
ago O
we O
went O
to O
some O
Chinese B-NORP
companies O
to O
do O
some O
surveys O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

For O
example O
, O
Haier B-ORG
, O
when O
companies O
like O
Haier B-ORG
, O
Lenovo B-ORG
, O
and O
Huawei B-ORG
go O
abroad O
, O
in O
fact O
others O
also O
see O
it O
as O
an O
arrival O
of O
Chinese B-NORP
wolves O
, O
who O
are O
seen O
as O
immature O
yet O
equally O
capable O
of O
biting O
people O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

So O
this O
, O
uh O
, O
personally O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
the O
arrival O
of O
, O
um O
, O
the O
wolves O
to O
be O
that O
horrible O
, O
though O
it O
is O
indeed O
wolf O
- O
like O
. O

Commissioner O
Li B-PERSON
said O
, O
ah O
, O
just O
now O
that O
all O
large O
trucks O
over O
ten B-QUANTITY
tons O
to O
a O
very O
large O
degree O
could O
be O
fake O
military O
vehicles O
. O

In O
that O
there O
is O
such O
a O
clear O
symbol O
, O
so O
why O
ca O
n't O
they O
be O
blocked O
and O
directly O
inspected O
at O
some O
toll O
booths O
, O
eh O
, O
and O
customs O
posts O
. O

This O
problem O
, O
from O
the O
time O
of O
the O
case O
we O
have O
handled O
, O
um O
, O
is O
mainly O
that O
they O
hang O
fake O
military O
license O
plates O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Ah O
, O
local O
law O
enforcement O
agencies O
, O
road O
inspection O
agencies O
and O
toll O
booths O
can O
not O
readily O
conduct O
more O
supervision O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
why O
can O
not O
this O
fleet O
of O
fake O
military O
vehicles O
be O
promptly O
captured O
. O

Judging O
from O
the O
recent O
period O
of O
investigation O
, O
inquiry O
and O
understanding O
, O
it O
is O
probable O
that O
they O
are O
also O
disguised O
as O
they O
carry O
out O
the O
operation O
. O

As O
they O
came O
out O
from O
the O
mining O
area O
and O
the O
, O
um O
, O
railroad O
stations O
, O
they O
normally O
hang O
local O
plates O
. O

Just O
before O
they O
reach O
a O
toll O
booth O
or O
an O
inspection O
station O
, O
they O
put O
on O
military O
vehicle O
plates O
. O

After O
they O
pass O
through O
the O
toll O
booth O
or O
the O
inspection O
station O
, O
they O
put O
the O
local O
plates O
back O
on O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

So O
, O
the O
stretch O
over O
which O
they O
used O
military O
vehicle O
numbers O
, O
fake O
military O
vehicle O
numbers O
is O
relatively O
short O
. O

So O
, O
it O
would O
be O
usually O
difficult O
to O
spot O
. O

What O
if O
a O
watch O
was O
, O
um O
, O
set O
up O
to O
conduct O
checks O
at O
toll O
booths O
. O

It O
's O
because O
these O
agencies O
, O
uh O
, O
only O
have O
an O
administrative O
authority O
. O

For O
example O
, O
registering O
and O
collecting O
fees O
when O
people O
arrive O
, O
ah O
. O

However O
, O
they O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
, O
um O
, O
law O
enforcement O
authority O
or O
this O
punishment O
power O
required O
for O
a O
, O
um O
, O
administrative O
penalty O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Um O
, O
so O
when O
they O
encounter O
these O
fake O
military O
vehicles O
, O
they O
too O
feel O
very O
much O
that O
their O
hands O
are O
tied O
. O

It O
is O
not O
like O
a O
public O
security O
agency O
. O

Public O
security O
agencies O
have O
a O
certain O
, O
um O
, O
this O
, O
law O
- O
enforcement O
authority O
. O

Professor O
Gao B-PERSON
, O
Japan B-GPE
seems O
to O
still O
insist O
on O
having O
talks O
on O
the O
hostage O
abduction O
issue O
, O
does O
n't O
it O
. O

Right O
, O
currently O
Japan B-GPE
's O
position O
, O
eh O
, O
is O
still O
for O
the O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
nuclear O
issue O
to O
be O
resolved O
together O
with O
the O
hostage O
issue O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Before O
, O
this O
, O
Kenichiro B-PERSON
Sasae I-PERSON
began O
his O
trip O
, O
um O
, O
Shinzo B-PERSON
Abe I-PERSON
had O
met O
with O
Foreign O
Minister O
Taro B-PERSON
Aso I-PERSON
and O
Kenichiro B-PERSON
Sasae I-PERSON
, O
stressing O
two O
points O
at O
that O
time O
. O

One O
, O
uh O
, O
was O
requiring O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
, O
ah O
, O
to O
have O
clear O
and O
concrete O
steps O
on O
the O
issue O
of O
nuclear O
abandonment O
. O

The O
other O
point O
was O
, O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
making O
sure O
to O
emphasize O
that O
Japan B-GPE
requires O
the O
hostage O
issue O
to O
be O
included O
in O
the O
framework O
as O
part O
of O
the O
six B-QUANTITY
party O
talks O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
they O
requested O
, O
eh O
, O
that O
if O
this O
so O
- O
called O
work O
in O
small O
groups O
can O
be O
added O
to O
the O
work O
hierarchy O
, O
eh O
, O
they O
hope O
that O
it O
can O
facilitate O
resolution O
of O
the O
hostage O
issue O
either O
bilaterally O
or O
multilaterally O
under O
the O
framework O
of O
the O
normalization O
of O
Japan B-GPE
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
relations O
. O

Um O
. O

As O
a O
section O
of O
the O
Beijing B-GPE
car O
industry O
like O
this O
, O
what O
movement O
will O
there O
be O
in O
terms O
of O
independent O
development O
and O
independent O
brands O
in O
the O
future O
. O

There O
are O
going O
to O
be O
big O
movements O
. O

Can O
you O
reveal O
them O
. O

I O
can O
reveal O
a O
few O
. O

We O
are O
planning O
to O
formally O
establish O
a O
main O
institute O
for O
car O
research O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
in O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
quarter I-DATE
of I-DATE
next I-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

This O
institute O
will O
control O
, O
as O
we O
now O
see O
it O
, O
seven O
local O
branch O
institutes O
. O

It O
will O
bring O
together O
and O
organize O
all O
of O
the O
car O
R O
& O
D O
teams O
in O
the O
Beijing B-GPE
region O
. O

Led O
by O
projects O
, O
ah O
, O
it O
will O
bring O
about O
ah O
, O
this O
, O
this O
kind O
of O
model O
. O

We O
are O
actively O
pushing O
that O
forward O
right O
now O
. O

This O
team O
will O
be O
formed O
very O
soon O
. O

Ah O
, O
this O
is O
the O
advantage O
of O
the O
capital O
, O
Beijing B-GPE
. O

So O
, O
recently O
we O
've O
been O
mostly O
concerned O
with O
preparing O
for O
establishing O
the O
institute O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
we O
're O
also O
actively O
preparing O
for O
two B-QUANTITY
products O
, O
two B-QUANTITY
complete O
car O
projects O
, O
that O
will O
be O
brought O
out O
next B-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

It O
's O
that O
your O
, O
this O
, O
assessment O
is O
clearly O
more O
confident O
than O
mine O
and O
also O
a O
lot O
more O
optimistic O
, O
uh O
. O

That O
's O
certain O
, O
ah O
. O

Uh O
, O
there O
are O
still O
more O
than O
just O
over O
ten B-DATE
years I-DATE
for O
us O
to O
forecast O
. O

Director O
Xu B-PERSON
made O
a O
statement O
that O
was O
true O
, O
ah O
, O
that O
is O
, O
from O
the O
viewpoint O
of O
the O
average O
consumer O
, O
there O
is O
a O
faily O
large O
gap O
between O
the O
technology O
in O
Chinese B-NORP
cars O
and O
the O
technology O
in O
foreign O
cars O
. O

So O
, O
why O
are O
you O
so O
confident O
. O

I O
always O
want O
to O
refer O
back O
to O
our O
country O
's O
, O
um O
, O
household O
appliances O
, O
ah O
, O
light O
industry O
, O
or O
the O
household O
appliance O
sector O
and O
compare O
it O
to O
our O
current O
vehicles O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
there O
are O
differences O
between O
the O
two B-QUANTITY
industries O
, O
but O
let O
's O
look O
at O
the O
trend O
, O
look O
at O
the O
tide O
. O

Who O
ever O
ah O
, O
five B-DATE
or I-DATE
six I-DATE
years I-DATE
ago O
, O
thought O
China B-GPE
's O
household O
appliance O
products O
would O
not O
only O
take O
hold O
of O
every O
corner O
of O
entire O
China B-GPE
, O
but O
also O
take O
hold O
of O
the O
better O
part O
of O
the O
international O
market O
. O

To O
tell O
the O
truth O
, O
I O
also O
did O
n't O
expect O
it O
, O
so O
I O
discovered O
just O
how O
low O
my O
level O
was O
, O
really O
. O

Really O
, O
at O
the O
time O
, O
I O
really O
did O
n't O
expect O
it O
. O

Later O
on O
, O
I O
also O
thought O
about O
this O
, O
that O
I O
had O
n't O
expected O
it O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Because O
at O
the O
outset O
, O
when O
joint O
- O
venture O
brands O
and O
, O
this O
, O
import O
brands O
were O
coming O
in O
, O
what O
everybody O
was O
crowding O
for O
and O
grabbing O
up O
were O
all O
those O
joint O
- O
venture O
brands O
and O
import O
brands O
, O
because O
they O
thought O
the O
quality O
was O
good O
. O

Well O
, O
then O
later O
on O
, O
we O
now O
discover O
that O
our O
domestically O
produced O
appliances O
are O
also O
extremely O
good O
. O

Not O
only O
do O
we O
use O
them O
ourselves O
, O
but O
we O
also O
export O
them O
. O

That O
is O
the O
truth O
. O

Er O
, O
have O
you O
been O
to O
an O
auto O
show O
. O

Yes O
. O

How O
many O
times O
did O
you O
go O
, O
ah O
. O

Twice O
. O

Um O
, O
we O
also O
go O
to O
auto O
shows O
. O

Er O
, O
how O
do O
we O
look O
around O
, O
eh O
. O

We O
go O
wherever O
there O
are O
beautiful O
auto O
showgirls O
. O

Then O
we O
go O
wherever O
that O
has O
the O
most O
attention O
- O
getting O
cars O
. O

What O
do O
you O
see O
when O
you O
go O
to O
an O
auto O
show O
, O
eh O
. O

Four B-QUANTITY
things O
to O
check O
for O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

First B-ORDINAL
, O
check O
companies O
. O

Second B-ORDINAL
, O
check O
new O
products O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Third B-ORDINAL
, O
check O
technology O
trends O
. O

Fourth B-ORDINAL
, O
check O
forums O
. O

Ah O
, O
we O
do O
n't O
check O
forums O
, O
we O
mainly O
check O
auto O
showgirls O
. O

Ah O
. O

These O
are O
the O
four B-QUANTITY
things O
to O
see O
. O

Speaking O
about O
checking O
auto O
showgirls O
, O
ah O
, O
I O
participated O
in O
the B-EVENT
Paris I-EVENT
Auto I-EVENT
Show I-EVENT
at O
the O
end O
of O
September B-DATE
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Well O
, O
a O
few O
days B-DATE
before O
the B-EVENT
Paris I-EVENT
Auto I-EVENT
Show I-EVENT
, O
I O
went O
to O
the B-EVENT
Hannover I-EVENT
Auto I-EVENT
Show I-EVENT
for O
a O
look O
. O

These O
are O
both O
top O
international O
auto O
shows O
, O
ah O
. O

Top O
international O
auto O
shows O
. O

One O
of O
my O
greatest O
impressions O
of O
such O
major O
shows O
as O
the B-EVENT
Paris I-EVENT
Auto I-EVENT
Show I-EVENT
-- O
later O
I O
read O
a B-ORG
People I-ORG
's I-ORG
Daily I-ORG
editorial O
, O
ah O
, O
written O
by O
a O
reporter O
-- O
there O
were O
no O
auto O
showgirls O
. O

No O
auto O
showgirls O
even O
if O
you O
went O
for O
a O
look O
. O

No O
auto O
showgirls O
. O

As O
for O
China B-GPE
's O
, O
this O
, O
exports O
, O
ah O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
the O
situation O
is O
also O
extremely O
bad O
. O

As O
far O
as O
, O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
half I-DATE
of I-DATE
this I-DATE
year I-DATE
is O
concerned O
, O
if O
you O
compare O
the O
ratio O
with O
that O
of O
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
that O
is O
, O
the O
foreign O
trade O
ratio O
of O
exports O
to O
imports O
, O
uh O
, O
compared O
year O
- O
on O
- O
year O
, O
overall O
it O
declined O
by O
33 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
. O

It O
is O
also O
said O
the O
rate O
of O
decline O
was O
one B-QUANTITY
third I-QUANTITY
, O
and O
it O
is O
also O
31 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
. O

This O
is O
a O
very O
, O
very O
serious O
problem O
. O

Ah O
, O
it O
's O
a O
very O
large O
problem O
figure O
. O

This O
means O
-- O

Right O
, O
it O
is O
that O
when O
compared O
year O
- O
on O
- O
year O
to O
itself O
, O
it O
declined O
by O
more O
than O
5 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
. O

So O
this O
reflects O
China B-GPE
's O
overall O
economy O
-- O
the O
export O
- O
based O
economy O
, O
uh O
, O
the O
foreign O
trade O
economy O
that O
supports O
the O
economic O
development O
of O
China B-GPE
, O
may O
also O
have O
big O
problems O
. O

Because O
China B-GPE
's O
economic O
development O
mainly O
relies O
on O
both O
foreign O
trade O
and O
tell O
domestic O
investment O
. O

Yes O
. O

Yes O
. O

Domestic O
demand O
can O
not O
keep O
up O
at O
all O
. O

Right O
. O

But O
now O
another O
problem O
has O
emerged O
. O

Because O
in O
recent O
years O
, O
eh O
, O
to O
maintain O
this O
employment O
rate O
, O
and O
in O
order O
to O
maintain O
this O
, O
this O
, O
er O
, O
GDP O
growth O
, O
large O
amounts O
of O
money O
were O
invested O
, O
large O
amounts O
of O
redundant O
investments O
were O
made O
. O

Right O
, O
there O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
this O
. O

This O
, O
production O
capacity O
, O
ah O
, O
has O
increased O
tremendously O
. O

Right O
. O

That O
is O
, O
in O
the O
past O
, O
production O
capacity O
would O
increase O
for O
a O
single O
category O
, O
cement O
, O
uh O
, O
or O
steel O
-- O
but O
now O
it O
has O
become O
universally O
increased O
. O

That O
's O
because O
you O
have O
already O
been O
investing O
for O
so O
many O
years O
, O
uh O
, O
thirty B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

Yes O
. O

However O
, O
domestic O
demand O
from O
the O
common O
people O
, O
eh O
, O
this O
, O
is O
not O
enough O
. O

This O
stuff O
, O
which O
can O
not O
be O
fully O
consumed O
, O
well O
, O
has O
to O
rely O
on O
exportation O
. O

With O
the O
export O
rate O
declining O
as O
you O
had O
just O
mentioned O
, O
to O
whom O
is O
your O
output O
going O
. O

You O
just O
said O
that O
when O
you O
went O
to O
see O
a O
car O
show O
, O
you O
first O
look O
at O
enterprises O
. O

Which O
enterprise O
. O

Your O
own O
enterprise O
. O

Look O
at O
the O
participating O
enterprises O
. O

Well O
there O
are O
a O
total O
of O
over O
1,500 B-QUANTITY
enterprises O
participating O
in O
this O
car O
show O
, O
and O
this O
is O
a O
historical O
high O
, O
ah O
. O

Basically O
, O
uh O
, O
this O
, O
world O
famous O
enterprises O
, O
as O
well O
as O
domestic O
enterprises O
, O
uh O
, O
were O
all O
present O
. O

There O
is O
a O
standard O
in O
measuring O
the O
level O
of O
a O
car O
show O
, O
that O
is O
, O
there O
are O
different O
levels O
in O
international O
auto O
exhibitions O
. O

That O
is O
AB O
, O
uh O
. O

now O
it O
is O
recognized O
that O
the O
auto O
show O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
is O
classified O
as O
an O
International O
A-grade O
auto O
show O
. O

They O
also O
have O
their O
own O
rating O
, O
right O
. O

It O
has O
a O
rating O
. O

Oh O
. O

The O
rating O
is O
not O
based O
on O
one O
's O
own O
assessment O
, O
ah O
, O
rather O
it O
is O
based O
on O
the O
degree O
of O
attention O
paid O
by O
the O
major O
enterprises O
on O
this O
car O
show O
. O

Degree O
of O
attention O
. O

Then O
, O
during O
last O
exhibition O
, O
ah O
, O
in O
2004 B-DATE
, O
among O
several O
international O
participants O
, O
only O
Ford B-ORG
Company O
rated O
the B-EVENT
Beijing I-EVENT
car I-EVENT
show I-EVENT
in O
the O
grade O
- O
A O
category O
. O

Oh O
. O

This O
time O
it O
is O
different O
, O
basically O
all O
participants O
rated O
it O
A O
. O

A O
moment O
ago O
, O
looking O
at O
the O
experience O
of O
our O
reporter O
, O
I O
was O
thinking O
that O
if O
now O
I O
was O
the O
family O
member O
of O
a O
sufferer O
and O
the O
sufferer O
's O
symptoms O
were O
also O
very O
critical O
, O
for O
example O
, O
something O
like O
heart O
disease O
, O
ah O
, O
the O
kind O
of O
illness O
where O
you O
are O
racing O
against O
the O
clock O
, O
well O
, O
the O
process O
of O
waiting O
for O
that O
voice O
prompt O
would O
definitely O
be O
too O
tortuous O
. O

Seeing O
that O
just O
now O
, O
my O
first O
reaction O
was O
that O
it O
was O
extremely O
irresponsible O
. O

And O
why O
. O

The B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
of I-ORG
Health I-ORG
asked O
that O
health O
care O
organizations O
focus O
on O
the O
patient O
. O

This O
set O
up O
is O
completely O
centered O
on O
itself O
. O

It O
is O
extremely O
indifferent O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
is O
unable O
to O
guarantee O
emergency O
treatment O
. O

So O
, O
among O
the O
advanced O
emergency O
systems O
of O
this O
kind O
that O
you O
have O
had O
contact O
with O
, O
what O
do O
you O
think O
is O
the O
most O
suitable O
model O
. O

The O
establishment O
of O
a O
consolidated O
emergency O
center O
. O

I O
see O
. O

This O
emergency O
center O
, O
when O
we O
dial O
its O
telephone O
number O
, O
it O
is O
immediately O
able O
to O
display O
our O
location O
. O

It O
has O
a O
regulation O
and O
control O
system O
and O
as O
well O
it O
has O
established O
many O
branch O
centers O
, O
or O
emergency O
stations O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Then O
, O
eh O
, O
immediately O
, O
based O
on O
the O
principle O
of O
proximity O
, O
it O
assigns O
corresponding O
emergency O
personnel O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
relevant O
treatment O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

We O
became O
aware O
, O
eh O
, O
that O
local O
healthcare O
administration O
departments O
were O
still O
some O
biased O
toward O
the O
understanding O
that O
only O
one O
emergency O
center O
can O
be O
established O
in O
a O
district O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

One O
emergency O
center O
does O
not O
mean O
that O
there O
is O
only O
one O
emergency O
station O
. O

Under O
an O
emergency O
center O
, O
there O
can O
be O
branch O
centers O
and O
emergency O
stations O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Well O
, O
the O
principle O
of O
emergency O
care O
is O
rapidity O
, O
proximity O
and O
capability O
. O

That O
is O
also O
to O
say O
, O
that O
a O
facility O
only O
needs O
to O
have O
emergency O
treatment O
capabilities O
, O
then O
following O
examination O
and O
approval O
by O
the O
health O
administration O
, O
it O
can O
become O
an O
emergency O
care O
center O
or O
emergency O
care O
station O
. O

Now O
you O
have O
also O
begun O
playing O
the O
role O
of O
a O
communication O
bridge O
between O
the O
two B-QUANTITY
of O
them O
. O

Can O
I O
ask O
you O
, O
ah O
, O
which O
part O
acutually O
shows O
Ma B-PERSON
Ying I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
jeou I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
so O
- O
called O
sincerity O
and O
benevolence O
. O

Um O
, O
I O
'll O
explain O
here O
in O
particular O
, O
because O
the O
fact O
is O
that O
the O
communication O
, O
ah O
, O
between O
the O
coalition O
happiness O
has O
actually O
gone O
on O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time O
. O

And O
Chairman O
Soong B-PERSON
, O
uh O
, O
he O
has O
also O
taken O
into O
consideration O
that O
because O
he O
himself O
is O
a O
candidate O
in O
Taipei B-GPE
, O
in O
the O
future O
it O
might O
not O
be O
convenient O
for O
him O
to O
routinely O
meet O
directly O
with O
Chairman O
Ma B-PERSON
regarding O
certain O
affairs O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

So O
he O
especially O
handed O
over O
to O
me O
the O
role O
of O
representing O
him O
in O
future O
affairs O
between O
the O
two O
parties O
of O
the O
Kuomintang B-ORG
and O
the B-ORG
People I-ORG
First I-ORG
Party I-ORG
, O
and O
to O
represent O
him O
in O
carrying O
out O
direct O
communication O
with O
Chairman O
Ma B-PERSON
. O

Um O
, O
over O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
few I-DATE
months I-DATE
, O
I O
have O
indeed O
represented O
Chairman O
James B-PERSON
Soong I-PERSON
in O
meeting O
with O
Chairman O
Ma B-PERSON
for O
a O
very O
long O
time O
and O
we O
discussed O
many O
issues O
concerning O
the O
two B-QUANTITY
parties O
' O
affairs O
. O

And O
as O
for O
that O
thing O
that O
Chairman O
Ma B-PERSON
wrote O
, O
it O
was O
because O
after O
that O
thing O
-- O
about O
the O
two B-QUANTITY
people O
meeting O
-- O
got O
out O
, O
outsiders O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
doubts O
. O

So O
in O
this O
situation O
, O
he O
was O
also O
particularly O
hoping O
that O
I O
could O
pass O
on O
the O
plan O
the O
two O
of O
them O
had O
for O
future O
development O
of O
the O
two B-QUANTITY
parties O
of O
the O
Kuomintang B-ORG
and O
the B-ORG
People I-ORG
First I-ORG
Party I-ORG
. O

In O
this O
direction O
, O
his O
benevolence O
and O
sincerity O
will O
absolutely O
not O
change O
. O

Okay O
. O

Er O
, O
just O
said O
that O
science O
subjects O
are O
taught O
by O
Mom O
, O
so O
you O
have O
to O
take O
care O
of O
math O
, O
physics O
, O
and O
chemistry O
. O

Right O
. O

How O
did O
you O
do O
in O
math O
, O
physics O
, O
and O
chemistry O
when O
you O
were O
in O
school O
. O

I O
did O
okay O
in O
science O
when O
I O
was O
in O
school O
, O
but O
not O
good O
in O
the O
humanities O
. O

Oh O
, O
well O
, O
when O
you O
were O
in O
school O
, O
you O
were O
good O
in O
the O
humanities O
but O
not O
good O
at O
science O
. O

Because O
we O
also O
did O
not O
have O
the O
opportunity O
to O
go O
-- O

I O
joined O
the O
army O
after O
I O
studied O
for O
two B-DATE
and I-DATE
a I-DATE
half I-DATE
years I-DATE
in O
middle O
school O
, O
er O
, O
we O
had O
not O
covered O
math O
, O
physics O
, O
and O
chemistry O
yet O
at O
that O
time O
. O

Uh O
. O

Later O
I O
did O
some O
self O
study O
, O
but O
without O
going O
through O
any O
systematic O
study O
, O
and O
then O
I O
entered O
the O
military O
academy O
. O

So O
I O
'm O
somewhat O
better O
in O
the O
humanities O
. O

And O
also O
during O
my O
many B-DATE
years I-DATE
of O
working O
in O
the O
lab O
, O
I O
have O
been O
working O
in O
the O
field O
of O
management O
and O
ideological O
education O
, O
so O
I O
have O
a O
better O
foundation O
in O
the O
humanities O
. O

You O
are O
responsible O
for O
Chinese B-LANGUAGE
, O
history O
, O
geography O
, O
and O
political O
science O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Right O
. O

Who O
is O
responsible O
for O
English B-LANGUAGE
. O

She O
is O
responsible O
for O
English B-LANGUAGE
herself O
. O

How O
can O
she O
learn O
English B-LANGUAGE
by O
herself O
, O
ah O
. O

She O
basically O
has O
to O
rely O
on O
herself O
to O
study O
English B-LANGUAGE
. O

Qianqian B-PERSON
how O
did O
you O
study O
English B-LANGUAGE
by O
yourself O
. O

Er O
, O
at O
the O
beginning O
, O
er O
, O
I O
went O
to O
, O
that O
is O
, O
those O
English B-LANGUAGE
tutoring O
classes O
for O
several O
years O
, O
that O
is O
, O
studying O
some O
basic O
, O
er O
, O
reading O
and O
writing O
rules O
and O
phonetic O
symbols O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Then O
later O
, O
after O
I O
came O
back O
home O
, O
I O
studied O
by O
myself O
. O

I O
first O
looked O
at O
the O
new O
words O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
text O
. O

After O
I O
read O
the O
new O
words O
, O
that O
is O
, O
I O
translated O
the O
entire O
text O
while O
checking O
the O
new O
words O
. O

After O
the O
translation O
, O
that O
is O
, O
I O
read O
it O
aloud O
twice O
, O
that O
is O
, O
after O
I O
could O
read O
it O
aloud O
quite O
smoothly O
, O
I O
started O
to O
listen O
to O
the O
English B-LANGUAGE
text O
using O
a O
repeater O
machine O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

But O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
have O
a O
, O
eh O
, O
grievance O
toward O
the O
Internet O
, O
or O
let O
's O
say O
that O
, O
I O
, O
the O
wit O
's O
end O
of O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
people O
working O
in O
the O
media O
industry O
recently O
. O

Uh O
. O

for O
example O
, O
um O
, O
I O
feel O
that O
if O
, O
for O
example O
, O
you O
were O
in O
the O
US B-GPE
and O
you O
got O
hold O
of O
a O
videotape O
of O
a O
porn O
movie O
, O
for O
the O
reason O
you O
just O
mentioned O
, O
um O
, O
the O
general O
public O
would O
not O
give O
it O
much O
attention O
. O

Unless O
you O
got O
into O
something O
that O
was O
too O
depraved O
. O

with O
something O
like O
that O
thing O
with O
Simpson B-PERSON
, O
when O
the O
entire O
population O
objected O
. O

Right O
. O

But O
here O
where O
we O
are O
, O
ah O
, O
what O
you O
have O
seen O
is O
the O
attention O
. O

You O
see O
, O
um O
, O
that O
hot O
- O
topic O
personalities O
are O
thrown O
up O
one O
after O
the O
other O
, O
and O
everybody O
pays O
attention O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
. O

Maybe O
I O
'm O
speaking O
rubbish O
, O
ah O
, O
but O
I O
wonder O
if O
there O
is O
a O
kind O
of O
slave O
- O
nature O
, O
ah O
, O
in O
our O
, O
this O
, O
bones O
, O
or O
something O
else O
. O

No O
. O

No O
, O
they O
are O
being O
led O
along O
. O

Why O
do O
I O
feel O
this O
is O
wrong O
. O

That O
is O
to O
say O
, O
um O
, O
for O
example O
, O
in O
the O
past O
, O
our O
subjects O
of O
conversation O
, O
um O
, O
we O
discussed O
politics O
; O
we O
discussed O
economy O
; O
we O
discussed O
culture O
; O
we O
discussed O
art O
; O
or O
we O
talked O
about O
other O
things O
, O
ah O
. O

But O
now O
what O
I O
often O
talk O
with O
him O
about O
, O
for O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
two I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
we O
have O
been O
completely O
led O
around O
by O
the O
nose O
by O
topics O
manufactured O
on O
the O
Internet O
. O

You O
say O
that O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
people O
were O
led O
around O
by O
the O
emperor O
for O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
few I-DATE
thousand I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

It O
might O
be O
um O
, O
that O
it O
will O
be O
the O
political O
parties O
that O
lead O
them O
around O
by O
the O
nose O
. O

And O
what O
about O
now O
. O

It O
is O
people O
leading O
them O
around O
by O
their O
noses O
. O

The O
people O
themselves O
are O
leading O
the O
people O
around O
-- O

In O
the O
name O
of O
the O
people O
. O

Whoever O
it O
is O
, O
it O
is O
always O
in O
the O
name O
of O
the O
people O
. O

You O
ca O
n't O
say O
that O
the O
web O
represents O
the O
people O
. O

Why O
has O
such O
a O
situation O
, O
ah O
, O
as O
you O
describe O
emerged O
in O
China B-GPE
. O

That O
is O
, O
why O
is O
the O
entire O
public O
space O
so O
monotone O
. O

Currently O
, O
I O
feel O
that O
it O
is O
mainly O
that O
there O
still O
is O
n't O
a O
sufficient O
rule O
of O
law O
in O
our O
society O
-- O
the O
level O
of O
rule O
of O
law O
is O
still O
insufficient O
. O

This O
morning O
, O
only O
Chen B-PERSON
Guangfu I-PERSON
, O
Chen B-PERSON
Guangcheng I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
eldest O
brother O
, O
went O
into O
the O
court O
to O
attend O
the O
reading O
of O
the O
verdict O
. O

Chen B-PERSON
Guangcheng I-PERSON
did O
n't O
feel O
any O
great O
surprise O
at O
the O
court O
's O
verdict O
, O
and O
immediately O
filed O
an O
appeal O
. O

Eh O
, O
they O
did O
n't O
arrange O
for O
anyone O
to O
go O
at O
all O
. O

Eh O
, O
they O
had O
n't O
arranged O
for O
any O
other O
people O
to O
attend O
. O

Those O
attending O
were O
all O
people O
from O
the O
police O
, O
prosecutor O
's O
office O
and O
the O
court O
. O

And O
even O
if O
other O
people O
wanted O
to O
go O
in O
, O
they O
could O
n't O
go O
in O
, O
right O
. O

Right O
, O
other O
people O
could O
absolutely O
not O
get O
in O
. O

My O
mother O
and O
third B-ORDINAL
brother O
had O
rushed O
over O
there O
, O
and O
they O
did O
n't O
let O
him O
go O
in O
, O
either O
. O

It O
was O
the O
same O
as O
the O
result O
from O
the O
first O
time O
. O

I O
think O
it O
's O
not O
a O
judgment O
based O
on O
the O
law O
but O
rather O
a O
judgment O
of O
power O
. O

It O
's O
not O
just O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Right O
, O
the O
lawyers O
had O
said O
a O
little O
earlier O
that O
if O
they O
maintain O
the O
original O
judgment O
in O
Chen B-PERSON
Guangcheng I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
case O
, O
they O
would O
immediately O
appeal O
to O
the B-ORG
Linyi I-ORG
Municipal I-ORG
Intermediate I-ORG
People I-ORG
's I-ORG
Court I-ORG
. O

Chen B-PERSON
Guangcheng I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
wife O
Yuan B-PERSON
Weijing I-PERSON
got O
the O
news O
in O
the O
hospital O
. O

She O
said O
that O
although O
she O
felt O
upset O
, O
she O
would O
still O
get O
herself O
stronger O
and O
support O
her O
husband O
. O

And O
what O
type O
of O
solutions O
do O
we O
have O
for O
problems O
of O
the O
type O
you O
just O
talked O
about O
. O

In O
the O
past O
, O
once O
some O
problems O
or O
cases O
of O
a O
pernicious O
nature O
arose O
at O
a O
school O
, O
specialized O
disciplinary O
actions O
, O
eh O
, O
would O
invariably O
be O
arranged O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Specialized O
disciplinary O
actions O
, O
eh O
, O
do O
indeed O
get O
passable O
results O
during O
the O
disciplinary O
period O
, O
but O
some O
problems O
easily O
resurge O
once O
the O
discipline O
is O
finished O
, O
rebounding O
again O
and O
again O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

So O
, O
eh O
, O
to O
fundamentally O
solve O
these O
problems O
, O
um O
, O
uh O
, O
um O
, O
shock O
discipline O
should O
be O
replaced O
with O
day O
- O
to O
- O
day O
management O
and O
the O
creation O
of O
a O
long O
term O
mechanism O
to O
safeguard O
the O
campus O
and O
protect O
the O
students O
. O

Therefore O
, O
that O
is O
, O
eh O
, O
the O
study O
by O
the B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
of I-ORG
Public I-ORG
Security I-ORG
, O
eh O
, O
discussed O
and O
put O
forth O
several O
hard O
- O
line O
measures O
. O

That O
is O
, O
these O
eight O
measures O
of O
ours O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

In O
them O
, O
eh O
, O
in O
a O
section O
relevant O
to O
this O
case O
, O
that O
is O
, O
it O
says O
there O
need O
to O
be O
people O
specifically O
appointed O
to O
investigate O
and O
solve O
the O
case O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

As O
for O
the O
areas O
surrounding O
the O
school O
grounds O
, O
patrolling O
and O
prevention O
will O
have O
to O
be O
strengthened O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
during O
times O
when O
students O
are O
getting O
in O
and O
out O
of O
school O
, O
people O
need O
to O
be O
sent O
to O
maintain O
traffic O
and O
public O
order O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Police O
manpower O
will O
be O
increased O
, O
right O
, O
uh-huh O
. O

Ay O
, O
police O
manpower O
will O
be O
increased O
. O

Yes O
. O

Then O
, O
eh O
, O
in O
the O
area O
surrounding O
the O
campus O
, O
eh O
, O
we O
must O
also O
demand O
an O
increase O
in O
traffic O
safety O
facilities O
, O
such O
as O
some O
signals O
and O
road O
lines O
. O

Besides O
these O
eight B-QUANTITY
measures O
by O
the B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
of I-ORG
Public I-ORG
Security I-ORG
, O
the B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
of I-ORG
Education I-ORG
also O
has O
six B-QUANTITY
measures O
. O

The O
direction O
of O
schools O
, O
ah O
, O
the O
strengthening O
of O
safety O
monitoring O
inside O

, O
ah O
, O
eh O
, O
the O
strengthening O
of O

the O

that O
is O

strengthening O
to O
some O
degree O
the O
internal O

, O

ah O
, O
they O
all O
make O
, O
um O
, O
very O
categorical O
demands O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Let O
me O
ask O
you O
, O
are O
the O
current O
costs O
of O
our O
Beijing B-GPE
- O
manufactured O
Hyundais B-PRODUCT
lower O
than O
the O
ones O
manufactured O
in O
South B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
. O

That O
's O
for O
sure O
. O

That O
's O
for O
sure O
. O

Let O
me O
ask O
a O
question O
you O
in O
return O
, O
ah O
, O
do O
you O
think O
China B-GPE
can O
become O
the O
world O
's O
car O
manufacturing O
center O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Eh O
, O
since O
I O
am O
not O
an O
expert O
, O
ha O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
you O
position O
this O
concept O
. O

I O
think O
there O
is O
no O
problem O
in O
becoming O
a O
production O
center O
. O

However O
, O
I O
am O
doubtful O
if O
it O
will O
become O
a O
center O
and O
a O
powerful O
country O
with O
an O
independent O
foundation O
as O
its O
core O
. O

You O
are O
not O
confident O
. O

I O
think O
, O
eh O
, O
I O
will O
answer O
the O
question O
this O
way O
, O
eh O
, O
with O
ten B-DATE
plus I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
China B-GPE
will O
surely O
become O
the O
car O
manufacturing O
center O
of O
the O
world O
. O

Uh O
. O

This O
concept O
of O
a O
manufacturing O
center O
is O
not O
just O
merely O
a O
concept O
about O
being O
a O
powerful O
manufacturing O
country O
. O

Well O
, O
it O
is O
such O
a O
concept O
involving O
product O
development O
, O
ah O
, O
technical O
support O
, O
concept O
of O
manufacturing O
, O
with O
technical O
services O
, O
sales O
, O
ah O
, O
after O
- O
sales O
services O
, O
and O
, O
ah O
, O
network O

. O

Well O
, O
why O
is O
this O
issue O
of O
impoverished O
students O
so O
prominent O
now O
. O

This O
issue O
did O
not O
exist O
at O
that O
time O
, O
um O
, O
um O
, O
before O
, O
um O
, O
1995 B-DATE
. O

Eh O
. O

Back O
then O
when O
a O
student O
went O
to O
college O
, O
he O
did O
not O
have O
to O
pay O
tuition O
. O

Besides O
not O
having O
to O
pay O
tuition O
, O
at O
that O
time O
, O
for O
example O
, O
at O
our O
Agriculture B-ORG
University I-ORG
, O
all O
students O
had O
very O
substantial O
student O
grants O
. O

Um O
, O
um O
, O
er O
, O
paying O
tuition O
by O
oneself O
and O
finding O
a O
job O
by O
oneself O
, O
um O
, O
started O
in O
1995 B-DATE
. O

Right O
. O

Right O
. O

At O
that O
time O
we O
called O
it O
two O
by O
oneself O
. O

Once O
it O
started O
this O
way O
, O
ah O
, O
this O
problem O
began O
to O
emerge O
. O

Higher O
education O
, O
it O
is O
not O
compulsory O
education O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

So O
fees O
are O
charged O
, O
you O
have O
to O
pay O
to O
go O
to O
college O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Ah O
, O
this O
is O
not O
the O
same O
as O
compulsory O
education O
, O
right O
. O

Well O
, O
, O
sharing O
the O
burden O
of O
education O
costs O
and O
paying O
to O
attend O
college O
by O
students O
, O
this O
is O
also O
a O
necessary O
option O
for O
advancing O
college O
education O
system O
reforms O
. O

In O
the O
end O
, O
we O
should O
acknowledge O
that O
currently O
expenses O
are O
still O
quite O
high O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

This O
should O
be O
compared O
with O
each O
of O
our O
household O
incomes O
. O

To O
the O
income O
of O
ordinary O
households O
, O
this O
is O
quite O
a O
heavy O
burden O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

To O
our O
low O
income O
and O
rural O
households O
, O
this O
is O
a O
burden O
that O
is O
difficult O
to O
bear O
. O

Right O
. O

Well O
, O
now O
that O
people O
are O
giving O
so O
much O
attention O
to O
this O
issue O
of O
impoverished O
students O
, O
uh O
, O
how O
should O
we O
respond O
to O
such O
an O
issue O
. O

Er O
, O
well O
the O
country O
is O
paying O
great O
attention O
to O
it O
, O
and O
provinces O
are O
also O
paying O
great O
attention O
, O
having O
adopted O
various O
measures O
. O

Er O
, O
so O
, O
now O
they O
have O
already O
started O
to O
establish O
an O
financial O
aid O
system O
for O
students O
from O
impoverished O
households O
, O
chiefly O
focusing O
on O
student O
loans O
, O
a O
system O
with O
scholarships O
, O
er O
, O
student O
grants O
, O
tuition O
waivers O
or O
reductions O
, O
and O
work O
- O
study O
. O

Among O
these O
programs O
, O
what O
do O
you O
appreciate O
most O
. O

This O
, O
it O
is O
too O
difficult O
to O
say O
, O
I O
think O
I O
should O
say O
maybe O
it O
's O
the O
next O
program O
ah O
-- O

The O
next O
program O
. O

Then O
, O
from O
these O
programs O
that O
we O
've O
seen O
, O
for O
instance O
from O
the O
surface O
, O
like O
the O
dragon O
dance O
, O
uh O
, O
it O
is O
easy O
and O
we O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
understand O
much O
about O
it O
, O
or O
like O
the O
fan O
dance O
, O
ah O
, O
or O
bowls O
- O
balancing O
dance O
, O
ah O
, O
it O
's O
a O
completely O
beautiful O
thing O
, O
a O
kind O
of O
artistic O
expression O
. O

Then O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
eh O
, O
I O
saw O
a O
program O
about O
Yue B-PERSON
Fei I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
total O
dedication O
to O
his O
country O
, O
uh O
, O
and O
the O
words O
his O
mother O
etched O
on O
him O
. O

Yes O
, O
yes O
. O

Then O
, O
if O
these O
children O
do O
not O
know O
Chinese B-NORP
history O
very O
well O
, O
do O
you O
think O
they O
can O
understand O
the O
program O
. O

Eh O
, O
through O
the O
form O
of O
theatrical O
performances O
, O
it O
is O
still O
quite O
popular O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
if O
for O
instance O
it O
is O
about O
telling O
a O
story O
, O
eh O
, O
then O
perhaps O
they O
may O
not O
have O
any O
perceptual O
understanding O
of O
it O
, O
oh O
. O

I O
remember O
an O
example O
just O
like O
this O
from O
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

Eh O
, O
after O
some O
children O
watched O
the O
program O
, O
they O
said O
, O
oh O
, O
the O
story O
this O
my O
parents O
told O
me O
several B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
is O
actually O
like O
this O
. O

He O
can O
actually O
feel O
it O
, O
after O
all O
, O
his O
story O
has O
become O
three B-QUANTITY
- O
dimensional O
. O

If O
it O
's O
simply O
a O
story O
, O
they O
probably O
can O
not O
remember O
after O
listening O
to O
it O
. O

Eh O
, O
I O
think O
there O
are O
one B-QUANTITY
or O
two B-QUANTITY
programs O
like O
this O
in O
each O
performance O
, O
and O
it O
is O
very O
educational O
, O
with O
deep O
, O
er O
, O
and O
profound O
significance O
. O

So O
, O
just O
now O
these O
two O
, O
eh O
, O
were O
analyzing O
these O
, O
ah O
, O
four B-QUANTITY
Kidd B-PERSON
class O
warships O
from O
different O
angles O
, O
some O
intrinsic O
problems O
that O
exist O
with O
them O
and O
the O
effectiveness O
they O
are O
able O
to O
achieve O
in O
terms O
of O
their O
military O
capabilities O
. O

So O
, O
at O
this O
current O
level O
, O
for O
the O
Taiwanese B-NORP
military O
, O
can O
they O
improve O
the O
current O
military O
strength O
of O
the O
Taiwanese B-NORP
military O
. O

I O
should O
say O
that O
, O
eh O
, O
these O
four B-QUANTITY
warships O
entering O
the O
Taiwanese B-NORP
navy O
will O
certainly O
enhance O
somewhat O
the O
Taiwanese B-NORP
military O
strength O
on O
the O
ocean O
. O

Yeah O
. O

But O
I O
should O
say O
this O
improvement O
is O
still O
quite O
a O
long O
way O
from O
the O
goals O
that O
Taiwanese B-NORP
authorities O
and O
Taiwanese B-NORP
military O
want O
to O
achieve O
. O

So O
, O
taking O
a O
broader O
perspective O
, O
eh O
, O
er O
, O
this O
kind O
of O
thing O
for O
the O
Taiwanese B-NORP
navy O
, O
it O
's O
slapping O
a O
coat O
of O
gold O
paint O
on O
, O
um O
, O
um O
, O
the O
surface O
of O
a O
house O
of O
straw O
, O
eh O
, O
to O
make O
it O
look O
, O
eh O
, O
better O
, O
more O
splendid O
. O

But O
a O
house O
of O
straw O
is O
a O
house O
of O
straw O
after O
all O
: O
it O
's O
not O
going O
to O
stand O
up O
when O
the O
big O
bad O
wolf O
comes O
. O

I O
think O
the O
political O
significance O
is O
greater O
than O
the O
military O
significance O
. O

after O
buying O
these O
four O
warships O
, O
eh O
, O
they O
psychologically O
feel O
that O
they O
've O
become O
a O
little O
closer O
with O
the O
US B-GPE
. O

Psychologically O
they O
feel O
that O
once O
they O
've O
got O
these O
four B-QUANTITY
, O
then O
it O
's O
as O
Chief O
Editor O
Chen B-PERSON
said O
just O
now O
: O
I O
slap O
on O
a O
coat O
of O
gold O
paint O
, O
then O
at O
least O
when O
the O
wolf O
comes O
, O
this O
first O
layer O
should O
be O
able O
to O
a O
limited O
extent O
, O
to O
act O
as O
a O
little O
protection O
. O

They O
even O
fantasize O
to O
themselves O
that O
, O
eh O
, O
this O
gold O
paint O
might O
actually O
be O
armor O
, O
it O
's O
this O
kind O
of O
political O
implication O
. O

This O
thing O
itself O
is O
now O
called O
the B-FAC
International I-FAC
Thermonuclear I-FAC
Experimental I-FAC
Reactor I-FAC
. O

Everyone O
first B-ORDINAL
wants O
to O
get O
this O
thing O
done O
successfully O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
its O
location O
is O
very O
important O
. O

Well O
, O
the O
final O
conclusion O
, O
eh O
, O
was O
to O
locate O
it O
in O
France B-GPE
. O

What O
is O
China B-GPE
's O
view O
on O
this O
. O

um O
er O
, O
from O
the O
very O
beginning O
, O
er O
, O
through O
our O
experts O
' O
investigation O
and O
research O
, O
the O
final O
, O
er O
, O
important O
conclusion O
was O
that O
we O
should O
choose O
France B-GPE
as O
the O
site O
. O

Er O
, O
the O
main O
reason O
is O
that O
this O
place O
, O
Cadarache B-GPE
, O
France B-GPE
, O
has O
, O
er O
, O
uh O
, O
better O
infrastructure O
, O
a O
better O
working O
foundation O
. O

So O
, O
as O
far O
as O
China B-GPE
is O
concerned O
, O
from O
the O
very O
beginning O
we O
firmly O
supported O
locating O
the O
site O
in O
France B-GPE
. O

Locating O
it O
in O
France B-GPE
will O
not O
interfere O
with O
our O
sharing O
of O
the O
achievements O
, O
will O
it O
. O

Since O
the O
site O
can O
only O
be O
in O
one O
country O
, O
we O
must O
effectively O
guarantee O
the O
rights O
of O
the O
various O
countries O
through O
, O
er O
, O
a O
treaty O
. O

Since O
the O
ability O
of O
criminals O
to O
avoid O
detection O
is O
so O
strong O
, O
what O
methods O
have O
you O
come O
up O
with O
to O
counter O
them O
when O
working O
a O
case O
. O

Um O
. O

Well O
, O
we O
might O
have O
an O
undercover O
investigation O
. O

We O
act O
as O
buyers O
looking O
to O
purchase O
plates O
or O
permits O
. O

The O
adversary O
then O
makes O
contact O
and O
communication O
for O
us O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

So O
, O
through O
contact O
and O
communication O
, O
right O
, O
we O
found O
out O
basic O
area O
of O
operation O
of O
these O
ten B-QUANTITY
or O
so O
cell O
phones O
was O
around O
Taiyuan B-GPE
. O

After O
that O
, O
the O
military O
and O
the O
local O
police O
jointly O
established O
a O
case O
and O
jointly O
adopted O
measures O
to O
directly O
hit O
and O
encircle O
the O
two B-QUANTITY
points O
, O
thereby O
realizing O
a O
pinpoint O
strike O
against O
them O
. O

We O
saw O
the O
close O
facsimiles O
of O
license O
plates O
they O
'd O
made O
, O
ha O
. O

they O
should O
have O
been O
most O
likely O
made O
from O
molds O
. O

Then O
, O
where O
did O
the O
molds O
come O
from O
. O

Did O
they O
make O
them O
by O
themselves O
too O
. O

Um O
, O
from O
what O
we O
understand O
, O
eh O
, O
this O
, O
the O
molds O
came O
from O
two B-QUANTITY
directions O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
they O
were O
from O
common O
tools O
that O
they O
'd O
bought O
in O
markets O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
there O
were O
specialized O
tools O
that O
they O
had O
somebody O
make O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
steel O
mold O
, O
or O
, O
in O
another O
example O
, O
the O
mold O
for O
the O
vehicle O
license O
plate O
frame O
. O

They O
brought O
these O
two B-QUANTITY
separately O
acquired O
tools O
together O
and O
in O
the O
end O
formed O
a O
contiguous O
and O
complete O
set O
of O
tools O
for O
making O
forged O
copies O
, O
ah O
. O

How O
much O
would O
they O
sell O
a O
set O
of O
military O
license O
plates O
for O
. O

This O
, O
from O
what O
we O
've O
seen O
during O
our O
campaign O
, O
prices O
vary O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Some O
stolen O
authentic O
plates O
can O
sell O
for O
up O
to O
sixty B-MONEY
thousand I-MONEY
yuan I-MONEY
. O

Some O
criminals O
who O
make O
fake O
plates O
sell O
or O
rent O
them O
as O
real O
plates O
. O

The O
highest O
has O
reached O
thirty B-MONEY
thousand I-MONEY
yuan I-MONEY
for O
one O
set O
. O

Wow O
, O
that O
's O
really O
a O
huge O
profit O
, O
ah O
. O

Yes O
. O

So O
when O
we O
look O
back O
again O
now O
, O
there O
is O
a O
huge O
difference O
between O
the O
current O
negotiations O
and O
the O
past O
negotiations O
. O

This O
huge O
difference O
is O
exactly O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
's I-GPE
change O
of O
status O
. O

An O
enormous O
change O
has O
taken O
place O
. O

Yeah O
. O

In O
the O
past O
, O
uh O
, O
the O
negotiations O
, O
uh O
, O
were O
conducted O
under O
the O
general O
suspicion O
that O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
had O
nuclear O
weapons O
and O
a O
nuclear O
program O
. O

Well O
, O
now O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
has O
already O
conducted O
a O
nuclear O
test O
, O
and O
well O
, O
it O
has O
also O
declared O
itself O
, O
like O
this O
, O
as O
a O
nuclear O
country O
, O
and O
wanted O
to O
participate O
in O
the O
talks O
in O
this O
role O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
several O
other O
parties O
, O
especially O
the O
US B-GPE
, O
are O
strongly O
opposed O
, O
and O
will O
absolutely O
not O
agree O
to O
it O
. O

Yet O
, O
here O
, O
we O
should O
see O
that O
there O
is O
still O
a O
certain O
level O
of O
flexibility O
at O
play O
here O
. O

However O
, O
the O
overall O
atmosphere O
still O
does O
n't O
give O
people O
much O
to O
be O
optimistic O
about O
. O

Well O
, O
eh O
, O
under O
this O
, O
eh O
, O
just O
as O
we O
talked O
about O
before O
, O
the O
financial O
sanctions O
can O
be O
discussed O
in O
separate O
groups O
. O

Then O
again O
, O
the O
US B-GPE
also O
sent O
a O
sort O
of O
message O
, O
ah O
, O
this B-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
er O
, O
actually O
earlier O
, O
eh O
, O
saying O
it O
could O
consider O
giving O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
some O
written O
assurance O
as O
well O
. O

That O
is O
, O
are O
n't O
you O
, O
this O
, O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
, O
very O
much O
concerned O
about O
your O
own O
security O
. O

Then O
the O
US B-GPE
can O
also O
consider O
giving O
this O
security O
assurance O
in O
, O
this O
, O
written O
form O
. O

Yeah O
. O

Mr. O
Zhu B-PERSON
, O
how O
do O
you O
view O
China B-GPE
's O
efforts O
to O
open O
up O
or O
establish O
such O
a O
free O
trade O
zone O
network O
in O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
two I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

Er O
, O
it O
should O
be O
said O
, O
eh O
, O
that O
establishing O
this O
kind O
of O
free O
trade O
network O
in O
different O
countries O
of O
the O
whole O
world O
centered O
on O
oneself O
has O
been O
a O
trend O
in O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
five I-DATE
years I-DATE
or I-DATE
so I-DATE
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

We O
know O
, O
eh O
, O
that O
originally O
, O
eh O
, O
this O
entire O
world O
trade O
system O
was O
called O
a O
multilateral O
trade O
framework O
based O
on O
the O
WTO B-ORG
. O

The O
precursor O
to O
the O
WTO B-ORG
was O
GATT B-ORG
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Er O
, O
it O
has O
been O
, O
um O
, O
running O
quite O
smoothly O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time O
. O

But O
we O
have O
seen O
that O
recently O
it O
has O
been O
having O
a O
very O
hard O
time O
, O
ah O
, O
especially O
with O
the B-EVENT
Doha I-EVENT
Round I-EVENT
talks I-EVENT
. O

Right O
. O

So O
, O
eh O
, O
this O
, O
the O
EU B-GPE
, O
in O
contrast O
, O
it O
has O
been O
making O
nonstop O
progress O
. O

That O
is O
, O
from O
the O
European B-NORP
Community O
to O
the O
Common O
Market O
, O
and O
then O
to O
the O
EU B-GPE
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

At O
present O
, O
the O
EU B-GPE
, O
um O
, O
has O
evolved O
from O
15 B-QUANTITY
states O
to O
25 B-QUANTITY
states O
as O
well O
as O
many O
partnership O
members O
. O

For O
example O
, O
it O
had O
these O
kinds O
of O
special O
trade O
arrangements O
with O
its O
former O
colonies O
, O
er O
, O
in O
North B-LOC
Africa I-LOC
, O
eh O
, O
and O
special O
arrangements O
with O
Turkey B-GPE
, O
among O
others O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
we O
have O
seen O
that O
the O
US B-GPE
, O
um O
, O
has O
changed O
too O
. O

The O
US B-GPE
changed O
in O
that O
it O
established O
the B-GPE
North I-GPE
American I-GPE
Free I-GPE
Trade I-GPE
Zone I-GPE
, O
and O
then O
, O
er O
, O
established O
the B-GPE
American I-GPE
Free I-GPE
Trade I-GPE
Zone I-GPE
. O

In O
addition O
the O
US B-GPE
is O
having O
talks O
across O
the O
ocean O
with O
Singapore B-GPE
and O
other O
countries O
on O
, O
this O
, O
free O
trade O
agreements O
. O

Well O
, O
here O
, O
um O
, O
that O
is O
, O
er O
, O
Southeast B-LOC
Asia I-LOC
, O
ASEAN B-GPE
has O
ten B-QUANTITY
states O
and O
is O
itself O
a O
free O
trade O
zone O
. O

Er O
, O
it O
is O
forming O
what O
is O
called O
Ten B-ORG
plus I-ORG
One I-ORG
with O
itself O
as O
the O
center O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

A B-ORG
Ten I-ORG
plus I-ORG
One I-ORG
with O
China B-GPE
. O

With O
India B-GPE
, O
another O
such O
emergent O
, O
um O
, O
market O
. O

Then O
, O
it O
has O
five B-QUANTITY
Ten B-ORG
plus I-ORG
One's I-ORG
with O
such O
developed O
countries O
as O
the O
US B-GPE
and O
Japan B-GPE
, O
and O
with O
South B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
. O

Its O
negotiations O
are O
underway O
, O
but O
the O
one O
finally O
negotiated O
successfully O
was O
the B-ORG
Ten I-ORG
plus I-ORG
One I-ORG
with O
China B-GPE
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Well O
, O
we O
have O
seen O
it O
as O
a O
kind O
of O
trend O
. O

This O
trend O
is O
in O
fact O
that O
, O
eh O
, O
while O
pushing O
for O
the O
multilateral O
trade O
agreement O
based O
on O
the O
WTO B-ORG
, O
everyone O
is O
additionally O
, O
eh O
, O
forming O
a O
-- O
we O
may O
not O
count O
on O
that O
thing O
, O
we O
do O
our O
own O
things O
first O
, O

Right O
. O

So O
, O
like O
the B-EVENT
APEC I-EVENT
meeting I-EVENT
in I-EVENT
Vietnam I-EVENT
this O
time O
, O
in O
fact O
the O
US B-GPE
proposed O
that O
since O
that B-EVENT
Doha I-EVENT
Round I-EVENT
talks I-EVENT
may O
be O
delayed O
indefinitely O
, O
our O
China B-GPE
can O
now O
traverse O
across O
the B-LOC
, I-LOC
this I-LOC
, I-LOC
Pacific I-LOC
Ocean I-LOC
via O
APEC B-ORG
to O
form O
a O
free O
trade O
zone O
first O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
we O
also O
heard O
some O
, O
er O
, O
rumors O
, O
ah O
, O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
er O
, O
that O
now O
Chery B-ORG
is O
also O
talking O
with O
other O
brand O
makers O
on O
joint O
venture O
or O
collaboration O
. O

It O
may O
manufacture O
for O
others O
, O
bear O
others O
' O
brands O
. O

Is O
that O
true O
. O

Er O
, O
because O
General O
Manager O
Yin B-PERSON
, O
eh O
, O
is O
personally O
taking O
charge O
of O
the O
area O
of O
joint O
ventures O
and O
collaboration O
. O

The O
final O
, O
this O
, O
model O
has O
not O
been O
completely O
decided O
. O

I O
think O
I O
can O
tell O
everyone O
one O
thing O
, O
that O
is O
, O
it O
is O
absolutely O
different O
from O
the O
joint O
venture O
in O
the O
past O
. O

It O
should O
be O
a O
type O
of O
subversive O
joint O
venture O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

In O
the O
past O
joint O
venture O
auto O
plants O
use O
China B-GPE
's O
market O
, O
this O
, O
China B-GPE
's O
plants O
, O
and O
then O
with O
overseas O
products O
, O
brands O
, O
and O
technologies O
. O

Well O
, O
this O
time O
it O
may O
be O
exactly O
the O
opposite O
. O

It O
will O
use O
the O
other O
party O
's O
market O
and O
produce O
the O
Chery B-ORG
brand O
. O

It O
wo O
n't O
bear O
others O
' O
brands O
. O

Market O
. O

Producing O
the O
Chery B-ORG
brand O
and O
products O
. O

Er O
, O
the O
details O
of O
this O
have O
not O
yet O
been O
completely O
formed O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

It O
can O
not O
be O
revealed O
now O
. O

I O
am O
not O
really O
clear O
about O
it O
either O
, O
because O
I O
was O
not O
involved O
in O
this O
project O
. O

I O
'm O
very O
sorry O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
asking O
this O
kind O
of O
question O
, O
er O
, O
-- O
how O
the O
company O
will O
operate O
specifically O
-- O
ha O
, O
is O
the O
business O
of O
the O
company O
. O

The O
kind O
of O
concern O
that O
everyone O
has O
expressed O
is O
how O
strong O
is O
our O
independent O
brand O
power O
. O

I O
should O
say O
it O
will O
stand O
unswerved O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

As O
our O
own O
brands O
have O
come O
to O
today O
's O
stage O
, O
if O
we O
can O
establish O
such O
a O
new O
joint O
venture O
, O
I O
should O
think O
it O
will O
be O
a O
time O
for O
us O
Chinese O
to O
feel O
proud O
. O

Ah O
, O
what O
a O
gratifying O
event O
! O

Wendao B-PERSON
will O
go O
to O
court O
! O

What O
do O
you O
mean O
gratifying O
, O
Gosh O
! O

There O
's O
been O
a O
lot O
going O
on O
lately O
, O
ah O
. O

I O
frequently O
go O
to O
court O
. O

Before O
you O
saw O
that O
I O
forgot O
to O
make O
a O
customs O
declaration O
and O
had O
to O
go O
to O
court O
. O

Later O
on O
, O
I O
neglected O
to O
declare O
and O
had O
to O
go O
again O
. O

Today O
I O
'll O
go O
in O
a O
while O
, O
yes O
. O

Today O
, O
um O
, O
it O
's O
to O
give O
-- O

Who O
did O
you O
offend O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
offend O
anybody O
. O

I O
was O
selected O
as O
a O
juror O
. O

To O
serve O
on O
a O
jury O
, O
to O
serve O
on O
a O
jury O
. O

Oh O
, O
you O
offended O
the O
accused O
. O

No O
, O
no O
, O
no O
, O
today O
it O
's O
like O
this O
. O

He O
first O
makes O
the O
selection O
, O
then O
the O
lawyers O
for O
the O
two B-QUANTITY
sides O
take O
a O
look O
. O

I O
still O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
I O
will O
be O
chosen O
. O

He O
still O
does O
n't O
know O
if O
he O
will O
be O
selected O
or O
not O
. O

It O
's O
like O
this O
; O
the O
lawyers O
for O
the O
two B-QUANTITY
sides O
have O
to O
look O
to O
see O
how O
the O
person O
is O
. O

Then O
everybody O
makes O
the O
selection O
together O
, O
the O
person O
has O
to O
be O
acceptable O
to O
all O
. O

So O
both O
people O
have O
to O
think O
that O
he O
will O
be O
beneficial O
to O
both O
sides O
. O

Beneficial O
to O
one O
's O
own O
side O
. O

Right O
, O
Right O
, O
that O
's O
right O
. O

Only O
then O
can O
he O
become O
a O
juror O
. O

So O
, O
that O
is O
-- O

normally O
they O
will O
do O
their O
best O
not O
to O
select O
people O
like O
us O
, O
ah O
, O
who O
work O
in O
media O
. O

Ah O
. O

Oh O
, O
they O
're O
afraid O
you O
are O
biased O
or O
, O
or O
will O
have O
influence O
-- O

They O
're O
afraid O
you O
are O
biased O
or O
that O
you O
will O
spread O
information O
, O
or O
that O
your O
opinions O
are O
too O
extreme O
, O
and O
so O
on O
and O
so O
on O
. O

Oh O
, O

There O
are O
times O
when O
it O
's O
not O
easy O
to O
fool O
them O
and O
things O
like O
that O
. O

Right O
, O
Right O
, O
that O
's O
right O
. O

Ay O
Today O
, O
Wendao B-PERSON
, O
so O
when O
you O
mentioned O
court O
, O
I O
thought O
of O
this O
kind O
of O
controversy O
over O
the O
Qiu B-PERSON
Xinghua I-PERSON
court O
case O
. O

The O
controversy O
, O
eh O
, O
actually O
caused O
me O
to O
feel O
deeply O
that O
we O
have O
to O
admit O
that O
our O
country O
, O
uh O
, O
is O
still O
a O
rather O
backward O
country O
. O

Economically O
, O
we O
are O
already O
very O
, O
very O
strong O
, O
but O
in O
reality O
when O
you O
talk O
about O
whether O
a O
country O
is O
, O
er O
, O
advanced O
or O
not O
, O
you O
do O
n't O
just O
look O
at O
the O
economy O
. O

That O
is O
also O
to O
say O
, O
ah O
, O
you O
would O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
hard O
time O
for O
the O
so O
- O
called O
western O
legal O
provisions O
, O
uh O
, O
to O
work O
here O
, O
ah O
. O

You O
are O
assuming O
that O
western O
legal O
provisions O
are O
advanced O
. O

Um O
. O

And O
our O
, O
eh O
, O
law O
, O
socialism O
, O
ah O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
make O
that O
assumption O
. O

My O
that O
-- O

My O
meaning O
is O
that O
we O
are O
all O
moving O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
globalization O
. O

That O
is O
not O
necessarily O
a O
question O
of O
being O
advanced O
or O
backward O
. O

Your O
whole O
-- O

That O
is O
to O
say O
, O
there O
is O
no O
way O
to O
implement O
many O
of O
our O
, O
uh O
, O
provisions O
. O

Whether O
or O
not O
they O
can O
be O
implemented O
is O
not O
necessarily O
a O
question O
of O
being O
advanced O
or O
backward O
. O

We O
know O
that O
, O
this O
, O
China B-GPE
is O
now O
making O
an O
effort O
to O
develop O
, O
this O
, O
a O
strategy O
like O
this O
to O
enhance O
its O
trade O
relations O
with O
the O
outside O
world O
, O
ah O
. O

So O
what O
is O
its O
ultimate O
intention O
. O

Er O
, O
in O
fact O
the O
three B-QUANTITY
things O
you O
have O
just O
listed O
are O
all O
close O
diplomatic O
interactions O
with O
developing O
countries O
, O
that O
is O
to O
create O
a O
kind O
of O
bilateral O
relations O
that O
are O
beneficial O
to O
Chinese B-NORP
enterprises O
and O
Chinese B-NORP
products O
to O
expand O
the O
markets O
of O
developing O
countries O
, O
and O
also O
to O
, O
eh O
, O
explore O
business O
opportunities O
within O
developing O
countries O
. O

Right O
. O

Yes O
. O

We O
know O
, O
eh O
, O
that O
when O
China B-GPE
opened O
up O
, O
it O
was O
mainly O
aimed O
at O
developed O
countries O
. O

In O
fact O
all O
developing O
countries O
initially O
, O
eh O
, O
opened O
up O
to O
developed O
countries O
. O

But O
, O
eh O
, O
once O
it O
gets O
to O
a O
certain O
level O
, O
it O
then O
gradually O
has O
some O
disputes O
with O
developed O
countries O
, O
and O
also O
, O
this O
, O
their O
status O
begins O
to O
get O
closer O
. O

Right O
. O

So O
, O
we O
can O
see O
that O
in O
, O
eh O
, O
this O
process O
, O
China B-GPE
continues O
on O
the O
one O
hand O
to O
strengthen O
this O
kind O
of O
links O
with O
developed O
countries O
, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
also O
can O
not O
avoid O
engaging O
in O
some O
negotiations O
, O
or O
even O
cross O
swords O
with O
some O
of O
them O
. O

Right O
. O

Well O
, O
for O
example O
, O
we O
see O
repeated O
crossing O
of O
swords O
between O
China B-GPE
and O
the O
EU B-GPE
, O
as O
well O
as O
between O
China B-GPE
and O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
, O
and O
this O
Mandelson B-PERSON
comes O
to O
China B-GPE
all O
the O
time O
. O

Yes O
. O

And O
soon O
, O
eh O
, O
this O
, O
a O
super O
luxurious O
delegation O
from O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
which O
basically O
includes O
such O
a O
large O
number O
of O
financial O
members O
in O
the O
cabinet O
, O
led O
by O
this O
, O
Paulson B-PERSON
will O
be O
soon O
visiting O
China B-GPE
eh O
, O
to O
conduct O
this O
strategic O
economic O
dialogue O
between O
China B-GPE
and O
the O
U.S. B-GPE

And O
then O
, O
China B-GPE
's O
finance O
minister O
visits O
other O
countries O
as O
well O
. O

Uh O
. O

But O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
we O
have O
seen O
, O
eh O
, O
that O
after O
China B-GPE
has O
strengthened O
, O
it O
will O
on O
the O
one O
hand O
continue O
to O
maintain O
good O
trade O
relations O
with O
developed O
countries O
, O
but O
on O
a O
more O
important O
level O
, O
it O
will O
need O
to O
develop O
similar O
good O
relationships O
with O
other O
parts O
of O
the O
whole O
world O
, O
with O
the O
vast O
number O
of O
developing O
countries O
. O

Uh O
. O

Because O
it O
highlights O
the O
strength O
of O
your O
country O
. O

Next O
, O
uh O
, O
let O
's O
direct O
our O
attention O
to O
the O
change O
from O
the B-ORG
Self I-ORG
Defense I-ORG
Forces I-ORG
to O
the B-ORG
Self I-ORG
- I-ORG
Defense I-ORG
Military I-ORG
. O

Well O
, O
if O
the B-ORG
Self I-ORG
Defense I-ORG
Forces I-ORG
become O
the B-ORG
Self I-ORG
Defense I-ORG
Military I-ORG
, O
what O
changes O
will O
it O
bring O
to O
Japan B-GPE
's O
military O
itself O
. O

First O
, O
the O
constitution O
does O
not O
allow O
it O
as O
, O
eh O
, O
a O
formal O
national O
defense O
military O
or O
armed O
forces O
. O

So O
it O
is O
called O
the O
SDF B-ORG
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

So O
the B-ORG
Defense I-ORG
Agency I-ORG
should O
be O
, O
um O
, O
first O
, O
eh O
, O
upgraded O
to O
a O
ministry O
. O

Upon O
completion O
of O
this O
upgrading O
, O
it O
may O
amend O
the B-LAW
SDF I-LAW
Law I-LAW
next O
. O

But O
you O
still O
have O
to O
follow O
the B-LAW
SDF I-LAW
Law I-LAW
at O
least O
for O
now O
, O
ah O
. O

So O
in O
the O
process O
of O
this O
upgrade O
to O
a O
ministry O
, O
it O
has O
started O
adjusting O
the O
duties O
of O
the O
SDF B-ORG
. O

We O
know O
this O
time O
this O
Defense O
Ministry O
bill O
has O
already O
incorporated O
the O
original O
supplementary O
, O
um O
, O
duties O
, O
uh O
, O
of O
the O
SDF B-ORG
into O
its O
, O
um O
, O
primary O
duties O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

The O
so O
- O
called O
supplementary O
duties O
, O
we O
know O
, O
include O
the O
participation O
in O
UN B-ORG
peacekeeping O
operations O
, O
this O
, O
international O
rescue O
missions O
, O
uh O
, O
and O
logistic O
support O
for O
the O
US B-NORP
military O
in O
accordance O
with O
its O
so O
- O
called O
Law B-LAW
Concerning I-LAW
Situation I-LAW
in I-LAW
Areas I-LAW
Surrounding I-LAW
Japan I-LAW
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

These O
, O
uh O
, O
were O
all O
previously O
classified O
as O
additional O
, O
supplementary O
duties O
. O

Now O
with O
the O
upgrading O
of O
the B-ORG
Defense I-ORG
Agency I-ORG
to O
a O
ministry O
, O
they O
will O
all O
be O
incorporated O
into O
the O
primary O
operations O
of O
the O
SDF B-ORG
. O

To O
put O
it O
in O
more O
common O
terms O
, O
it O
means O
that O
the O
SDF B-ORG
mainly O
took O
care O
of O
affairs O
at O
home O
in O
the O
past O
, O
and O
in O
the O
future O
the O
SDF B-ORG
will O
be O
mainly O
engaged O
in O
external O
affairs O
. O

Yeah O
, O
in O
this O
way O
, O
what O
it O
does O
will O
be O
perfectly O
justifiable O
. O

Eh O
. O

I O
understand O
what O
you O
mean O
. O

Need O
to O
struggle O
, O
yet O
a O
fist O
- O
fight O
is O
not O
appropriate O
, O
so O
the O
best O
way O
is O
a O
water O
- O
fight O
. O

Yes O
. O

Eh O
, O
a O
water O
- O
fight O
can O
train O
him O
in O
multiple O
ways O
, O
and O
can O
prevent O
harm O
. O

But O
do O
n't O
we O
need O
to O
consider O
saving O
water O
. O

Eh O
, O
yes O
. O

But O
our O
water O
conservation O
has O
an O
issue O
about O
proportion O
. O

Yes O
. O

Uh-huh O
, O
the O
water O
gun O
holds O
and O
uses O
a O
very O
small O
amount O
of O
water O
. O

If O
some O
water O
vehicles O
spill O
a O
little O
from O
their O
side O
, O
and O
everywhere O
try O
and O
solve O
it O
a O
little O
, O
this O
problem O
will O
be O
solved O
. O

Very O
good O
, O
I O
feel O
that O
your O
parents O
are O
really O
democratic O
. O

Your O
family O
is O
very O
democratic O
. O

Your O
parents O
have O
never O
severely O
reprimanded O
you O
, O
right O
. O

And O
of O
course O
they O
'd O
never O
hit O
you O
; O
in O
general O
I O
think O
girls O
do O
n't O
get O
beaten O
, O
right O
. O

Yes O
, O
sometimes O
when O
I O
really O
provoked O
them O
they O
would O
, O
but O
this O
rarely O
happens O
. O

Yes O
. O

Usually O
what O
do O
they O
scold O
you O
about O
. O

Uh-huh O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
remember O
that O
. O

Because O
in O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
two I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
in O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
two I-DATE
years I-DATE
it O
seems O
that O
they O
have O
n't O
lost O
their O
temper O
too O
badly O
. O

Is O
it O
because O
you O
have O
good O
temper O
, O
or O
has O
she O
been O
behaving O
exceptionally O
well O
. O

She O
behaves O
well O
. O

She O
is O
, O
very O
sensible O
. O

That O
is O
to O
say O
, O
things O
that O
other O
children O
would O
do O
that O
would O
cause O
their O
parents O
to O
discipline O
them O
basically O
do O
not O
happen O
to O
her O
. O

eh O
, O
look O
at O
the O
way O
she O
usually O
talks O
, O
you O
see O
, O
it O
is O
not O
very O
much O
like O
a O
14 B-DATE
- I-DATE
year I-DATE
- I-DATE
old I-DATE
child O
. O

She O
seems O
young O
and O
competent O
, O
right O
. O

She O
really O
does O
. O

If O
this O
current O
plan O
is O
followed O
, O
especially O
until O
around O
the O
year O
2050 B-DATE
, O
and O
this O
use O
of O
this O
, O
er O
, O
technique O
can O
be O
globally O
commercialized O
. O
What O
does O
it O
mean O
for O
mankind O
. O

I O
think O
maybe O
we O
have O
to O
discuss O
this O
from O
the O
perspective O
of O
the O
situation O
, O
the O
plight O
, O
we O
currently O
face O
. O

From O
what O
I O
understand O
, O
even O
based O
on O
current O
levels O
, O
our O
current O
energy O
resources O
will O
only O
manage O
to O
satisfy O
the O
demand O
of O
all O
mankind O
for O
one B-DATE
hundred I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

Um O
, O
particularly O
with O
respect O
to O
our O
country O
, O
China B-GPE
, O
China B-GPE
's O
energy O
resources O
are O
relatively O
inadequate O
. O

This O
, O
for O
example O
, O
our O
per O
capita O
energy O
resource O
occupation O
might O
only O
be O
equal O
, O
er O
, O
to O
one O
half O
the O
global O
average O
, O
while O
in O
oil O
it O
is O
only O
equivalent O
to O
one O
tenth O
. O

Um O
, O
we O
have O
once O
considered O
what O
China B-GPE
will O
be O
like O
in O
2050 B-DATE
. O

We O
did O
some O
calculations O
and O
the O
average O
energy O
consumption O
of O
we O
Chinese B-GPE
is O
currently O
one O
ton O
coal O
equivalent O
. O

If O
by O
2050 B-DATE
we O
have O
merely O
increased O
threefold O
to O
three B-QUANTITY
tons O
coal O
equivalent O
, O
then O
at O
that O
time O
China B-GPE
's O
total O
energy O
resources O
will O
have O
to O
increase O
to O
three B-QUANTITY
times O
the O
present O
levels O
. O

Hello O
audience O
, O
now O
is O
the O
time O
for O
independent O
commentary O
. O

In O
a O
few O
days O
, O
eh O
, O
the B-EVENT
2006 I-EVENT
Central I-EVENT
Economic I-EVENT
Work I-EVENT
Conference I-EVENT
will O
be O
convened O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
. O

Yes O
. O

At O
the O
conference O
, O
they O
certainly O
will O
discuss O
, O
ah O
, O
um O
, O
the O
current O
economic O
situation O
of O
China B-GPE
. O

Yes O
. O

So O
, O
we O
also O
want O
to O
discuss O
this O
before O
the O
conference O
begins O
. O

Let O
's O
talk O
about O
what O
kind O
of O
economic O
situation O
China B-GPE
is O
facing O
today O
. O

Uh-huh O
, O
recently O
, O
ah O
, O
China B-GPE
, O
eh O
, O
has O
announced O
numerous O
statistics O
. O

Yes O
, O
if O
observing O
from O
the O
overall O
statistics O
, O
and O
in O
fact O
the O
CCP B-ORG
itself O
has O
also O
announced O
, O
ah O
, O
that O
the O
CCP B-ORG
's O
economy O
will O
face O
a O
crisis O
of O
collapse O
in O
2008 B-DATE
. O

Yes O
, O
first O
of O
all O
, O
um O
, O
the O
deputy O
director O
of O
the O
People O
's O
Bank O
of O
China O
, O
Su O
Ning O
, O
he O
has O
announced O
some O
statistics O
. O

What O
did O
he O
say O
. O

He O
said O
that O
the O
rate O
of O
saving O
, O
uh O
, O
of O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
people O
, O
ah O
, O
had O
risen O
9 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
from O
ten B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago O
. O

And O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
eh O
, O
that O
is O
, O
the O
eh O
, O
eh O
, O
statistics O
of O
the O
ratio O
of O
national O
expenditure O
to O
GDP O
has O
again O
fallen O
10 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
. O

Oh O
, O
one O
rises O
10 B-QUANTITY
, O
and O
the O
other O
has O
fallen O
. O

Fallen O
. O

What O
is O
even O
more O
frightening O
. O

Personal O
expenditures O
of O
citizens O
have O
already O
fallen O
eh O
, O
from O
50-something B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
, O
ah O
, O
to O
the O
current O
40 B-QUANTITY
- I-QUANTITY
plus I-QUANTITY
, O
that O
is O
, O
it O
has O
fallen O
to O
42 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
. O

So O
, O
one O
has O
fallen O
from O
42 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
to O
38 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
, O
also O
a O
decline O
of O
10 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
-- O

That O
is O
, O
, O
ah O
, O
the O
people O
save O
most O
of O
the O
money O
they O
make O
, O
and O
the O
level O
of O
expenditures O
is O
getting O
lower O
and O
lower O
. O

So O
, O
right O
now O
, O
ah O
, O
this O
reflects O
a O
problem O
, O
say O
, O
these O
two B-QUANTITY
things O
are O
one O
, O
eh O
, O
very O
relevantly O
interconnected O
matter O
, O
a O
matter O
, O
that O
because O
with O
personal O
expenditures O
, O
eh O
, O
if O
there O
is O
no O
spending O
, O
the O
economy O
can O
not O
grow O
and O
there O
is O
no O
way O
to O
develop O
the O
economy O
. O

Um O
, O
well O
, O
initially O
how O
did O
you O
get O
the O
feeling O
that O
it O
would O
be O
really O
hard O
to O
get O
a O
deposition O
. O

Er O
, O
when O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
the O
victim O
, O
she O
did O
not O
want O
to O
meet O
with O
us O
. O

She O
hid O
after O
you O
made O
the O
inquiry O
. O

Even O
if O
after O
you O
found O
her O
, O
she O
also O
-- O
once O
asked O
questions O
-- O
this O
thing O
did O
n't O
happen O
to O
me O
. O

Mainly O
out O
of O
fear O
, O
fear O
of O
retaliation O
, O
right O
. O

Yes O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

-- O

He O
was O
, O
for O
one O
thing O
, O
afraid O
of O
retaliation O
, O
and O
moreover O
, O
he O
was O
not O
sure O
whether O
this O
time O
you O
the O
police O
agency O
could O
execute O
a O
thorough O
crackdown O
. O

Right O
. O

He O
could O
n't O
perceive O
your O
resolution O
and O
your O
capabilities O
. O

Uh-huh O
, O
how O
could O
you O
make O
a O
breakthrough O
. O

We O
did O
two B-QUANTITY
things O
to O
make O
a O
breakthrough O
in O
getting O
the O
deposition O
. O

First B-ORDINAL
, O
we O
publicized O
to O
the O
masses O
our O
determination O
this O
time O
to O
fight O
against O
evil O
. O

Another O
thing O
was O
to O
publicize O
through O
scrolling O
media O
headlines O
. O

Well O
, O
their O
municipal O
bureau O
did O
several O
runs O
of O
this O
kind O
of O
propaganda O
report O
on O
, O
um O
, O
TV O
, O
for O
example O
, O
saying O
that O
fighting O
evil O
has O
no O
timetable O
, O

So O
, O
the O
public O
was O
very O
afraid O
that O
you O
would O
fight O
for O
a O
while O
and O
then O
you O
would O
stop O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Was O
n't O
the O
investigation O
done O
in O
secret O
. O

How O
could O
there O
be O
propaganda O
advertisements O
. O

Well O
, O
on O
December B-DATE
11 I-DATE
, O
that O
is O
, O
four B-QUANTITY
criminal O
suspects O
who O
participated O
in O
special O
case O
1009 O
also O
turned O
themselves O
in O
, O
in O
Huainan B-GPE
City I-GPE
, O
another O
of O
our O
cities O
. O

So O
, O
by O
interrogating O
them O
, O
the O
details O
of O
the O
case O
became O
clear O
as O
well O
. O

Well O
, O
subsequently O
we O
thought O
that O
based O
on O
the O
information O
we O
previously O
obtained O
; O
it O
was O
time O
to O
go O
public O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Well O
, O
during O
the O
live O
news O
interview O
with O
Professor O
Ruan B-PERSON
just O
now O
, O
I O
heard O
you O
say O
that O
the O
focuses O
of O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
and O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
do O
not O
seem O
to O
be O
in O
sync O
right O
now O
. O

So O
what O
should O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
be O
concerned O
about O
this O
time O
. O

This O
, O
actually O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
has O
been O
very O
specific O
, O
both O
Bush B-PERSON
and O
Rice B-PERSON
have O
delivered O
speeches O
, O
which O
are O
very O
clear O
, O
and O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
the O
September B-DATE
19 I-DATE
joint O
statement O
must O
be O
fully O
and O
comprehensively O
implemented O
. O

Well O
also O
, O
if O
we O
refine O
it O
a O
little O
bit O
, O
eh O
, O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
is O
required O
to O
abandon O
its O
nuclear O
weapons O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
abandon O
nuclear O
weapons O
, O
there O
is O
nothing O
we O
can O
talk O
about O
. O

There O
is O
also O
a O
return O
, O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
must O
return O
to O
this B-LAW
Nuclear I-LAW
Non-Proliferation I-LAW
Treaty I-LAW
. O

And O
they O
must O
place O
their O
nuclear O
plans O
, O
eh O
, O
under O
the O
, O
this O
, O
supervision O
of O
the B-ORG
, I-ORG
this I-ORG
, I-ORG
International I-ORG
Atomic I-ORG
Energy I-ORG
Agency I-ORG
. O

Hill B-PERSON
also O
said O
that O
if O
possible O
, O
he O
wished O
to O
go O
home O
for O
Christmas B-EVENT
. O

He O
hopes O
that O
this O
issue O
would O
be O
resolved O
before O
the O
Christmas B-EVENT
holiday O
. O

Ah O
, O
yes O
, O
at O
least O
there O
is O
an O
initial O
result O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
want O
to O
ask O
, O
this O
, O
Professor O
Yang B-PERSON
, O
what O
do O
you O
think O
, O
um O
, O
they O
could O
do O
to O
guarantee O
that O
the O
Kidd B-PERSON
- O
class O
battleship O
is O
not O
sunk O
during O
the O
process O
of O
an O
exercise O
. O

Eh O
, O
this O
so O
- O
called O
not O
, O
not O
being O
sunk O
during O
exercises O
, O
eh O
, O
according O
to O
military O
strategic O
logic O
, O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
in O
, O
that O
, O
combat O
models O
, O
and O
in O
Han B-EVENT
Kuang I-EVENT
18 I-EVENT
, O
it O
was O
sunk O
in O
less O
than O
twenty B-QUANTITY
minutes O
. O

This O
caused O
, O
eh O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
tension O
in O
the O
Taiwanese B-NORP
government O
, O
and O
in O
partiular O
its O
defense O
department O
had O
put O
forward O
that O
it O
could O
n't O
be O
sunk O
. O

It O
's O
because O
, O
eh O
, O
they O
were O
n't O
considering O
it O
from O
a O
military O
standpoint O
, O
but O
rather O
from O
the O
standpoint O
of O
political O
confidence O
. O

So O
what O
do O
they O
do O
. O

If O
the O
opponent O
makes O
an O
attack O
, O
well O
then O
, O
eh O
, O
I O
make O
your O
missiles O
subsonic O
. O

That O
is O
one O
thing O
. O

Second B-ORDINAL
, O
eh O
, O
if O
you O
want O
to O
attack O
me O
, O
based O
on O
the O
exercises O
in O
Han B-EVENT
Kuang I-EVENT
19 I-EVENT
and I-EVENT
20 I-EVENT
, O
you O
first O
have O
to O
inform O
me O
when O
you O
are O
going O
to O
attack O
. O

That O
is O
like O
saying O
, O
that O
you O
're O
not O
carrying O
out O
actual O
battle O
exercises O
, O
but O
rather O
engaging O
in O
a O
child O
's O
game O
of O
make O
pretend O
. O

You O
're O
going O
to O
come O
, O
you O
come O
and O
knock O
on O
the O
door O
, O
You O
're O
going O
to O
attack O
me O
. O

Okay O
, O
I O
get O
ready O
. O

So O
they O
have O
fiddled O
with O
two O
major O
parameters O
. O

After O
that O
, O
they O
achieved O
a O
result O
where O
in O
the O
Han B-EVENT
Kuang I-EVENT
21 I-EVENT
exercises O
they O
were O
able O
to O
have O
a O
Kidd B-PERSON
- O
class O
battleship O
fleet O
intercept O
a O
so O
- O
called O
mainland O
landing O
force O
, O
intercept O
a O
PLA B-ORG
force O
of O
forty B-QUANTITY
thousand I-QUANTITY
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Almost O
one B-QUANTITY
quarter I-QUANTITY
of O
the O
military O
strength O
of O
the O
intercepting O
force O
was O
beaten O
. O

They O
were O
indeed O
able O
to O
make O
such O
a O
big O
adjustment O
. O

So O
there O
's O
this O
big O
taboo O
in O
the O
model O
, O
a O
big O
taboo O
for O
the O
military O
strategists O
. O

That O
is O
, O
if O
you O
adjust O
a O
two B-QUANTITY
small O
parameters O
, O
the O
entire O
final O
outcome O
might O
be O
different O
from O
what O
everybody O
expects O
. O

Militarily O
, O
particularly O
in O
this O
kind O
of O
military O
confrontation O
exercise O
, O
it O
's O
an O
absolute O
joke O
. O
