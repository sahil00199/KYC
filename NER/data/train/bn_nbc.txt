Why O

As O

which O

Friends O
point O
out O
that O
the O

George B-PERSON

insist O

it O

This O

This O

if O

an O

from O

What O
we O

seeing O
is O
that O
in O

basically O
destiny O

meaning O
you O
may O
be O
destined O
, O
if O
you O

in O

, O
to O
have O
major O

Why O
these O
great O
variations O
? O

Not O
what O
you O
may O
think O
. O

Not O
the O
size O
of O

the O

quality O

the O

It O
seems O
to O
be O
more O
what O

in O
each O
area O
are O
used O
to O
recommending O
, O
but O
patients O
do O
n't O
know O
that O
. O

The O
problem O
of O
this O
incredible O
variation O
is O
to O
get O
the O
patients O
involved O
in O
making O
decisions O
that O
express O
their O
own O
preferences O

So O
Dartmouth B-ORG

and O
in O

, O
a O

this O

when O
the O

, O
`` O
I O

the O

I O

to O
control O
this O
. O

Israelis B-NORP
have O
long O
argued O
that O
Arat B-PERSON
can O
and O
should O
do O
just O
that O
. O

So O
if O
Mr. O
Arafat B-PERSON
can O
in O
one B-CARDINAL
single O
word O
stop O
the O
violence O
and O
get O
back O
to O
the O
negotiations O
table O
, O
I O
think O
he O
will O
find O
readiness O
and O
willingness O
on O
the O
Israeli B-NORP
side O
to O
reach O
a O
reasonable O
agreement O
. O

But O
as O
protests O
in O
support O
of O
the O
Palestinians B-NORP
sprang O
up O
from O
Egypt B-GPE
to O
Morocco B-GPE
to O
Iraq B-GPE
, O
Arafat B-PERSON
's O
advisers O
suggested O
that O
his O
power O
to O
stop O
the O
violence O
may O
be O
limited O
. O

President O
Arafat B-PERSON
can O
not O
give O
orders O
to O
a O
people O
, O
to O
a O
whole O
nation O
, O
that O
is O
being O
killed O
every B-DATE

and O
being O
asked O
to O
lie O
back O
and O
to O
die O
quietly O
, O
not O
to O
defend O
themselves O
. O

The O
disagreement O
over O
which O
side O
should O
bear O
the O
greatest O
blame O
spilled O
over O
to O
the B-ORG
United I-ORG

A O

criticized O
Israel B-GPE

The O
U.S. B-GPE
tried O
to O
water O
down O
the O
measure O
, O
then O
abstained O
from O
voting O
. O

The O
administration O
, O
hoping O
to O
de-escalate O
the O
violence O
, O
is O
appealing O
to O
both O
sides O
. O

That O
requires O
even O
greater O
efforts O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the B-ORG
Palestinian I-ORG
Authority I-ORG
to O
try O
to O

to O

on O

that O

A O

Experts O

that O
term O

It O

true O

the O
gap O

this O

First O
, O

Another O
key O
issue O
this O

-- O
how O
to O
deal O

failing O
public O

One B-CARDINAL
of O
Bush B-PERSON

solutions O
-- O
double O
the O
number O
of O
independent O
, O
publicly O
funded O
schools O
, O
known O
as O
charter O
schools O
. O

We O
encourage O
parents O
to O
take O
a O
look O
at O
the O
comparative O
results O
of O
schools O
. O

We O
've O
got O
a O
strong O
charter O
school O
movement O
that O
I O
signed O
the O
legislation O
to O
get O
started O
in O
the O
state O
of O
Texas B-GPE
. O

But O
experts O
say O
the O
early O
record O
of O
charter O
schools O
in O
Texas B-GPE
is O
not O
as O
strong O
as O
Bush B-PERSON
claims O
. O

Some O
schools O
, O
like O
Houston B-GPE

KIPP B-ORG
Academy I-ORG
, O
are O
said O
to O
be O
doing O
a O
great O
job O
with O
economically O
disadvantaged O
students O
, O
but O
a O
report O
finds O
that O
charter O
schools O
overall O
in O
Texas B-GPE
have O
more O
students O
per O
teacher O
, O
less O
experienced O
teachers O
and O
lower O
test O
scores O
. O

It O
's O
a O
mixed O
picture O
. O

Charter O
schools O
are O
having O
some O
successes O
and O
some O
struggles O
. O

But O
overall O
, O
students O
in O
charter O
schools O
have O
lower O
performance O

students O
in O
traditional O
public O
schools O

So O
how O
would O
Gore O
deal O
with O
failing O
public O
schools O
? O

If O
it O

a O
failing O
school O
, O
shut O
it O

turnaround O
team O
of O
specialists O
the O
way O
Governor O
Jim B-PERSON
Hunt I-PERSON
does O
in O
North B-GPE
Carolina I-GPE
. O

But O
Governor O
Hunt B-PERSON
's O
office O
says O
no O
school O
has O
been O
shut O
down O
yet O
in O
his O
state O
. O

So O
experts O
say O
it O
's O
too O
soon O
to O
tell O
if O
it O
works O
, O
and O
some O
call O
Gore B-PERSON
's O
plan O
an O
empty O
promise O
. O

Why O
? O

Because O
they O
say O
Gore B-PERSON
does O
not O
require O
the O
kind O
of O
annual B-DATE
student O
testing O
needed O
to O
tell O
whether O
a O
school O
is O
failing O
or O
not O
. O

There O
's O
simply O
not O
as O
much O
there O
as O
Vice O
President O
Gore B-PERSON
is O
pretending O
that O
there O
is O
. O

It O
's O
really O
more O
rhetoric O
than O
substance O
. O

Most O
misleading O
of O
all O
, O
experts O
say O
, O
is O
each O
candidate O
's O
claim O
that O
his O
plan O
can O
dramatically O
improve O
public O
education O
. O

Because O
federal O
money O
accounts O
for O
only B-PERCENT
7 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
school O
funding O
, O
experts O
say O
any O
President O
can O
help O
only O
at O
the O
margins O

The O

the O

The O
authors O
' O
conclusion O
? O

Beware O
of O
smoke O

mirrors O
from O
both O

I O
would O
have O
some O
skepticism O
toward O
both O
plans O
. O

They O
're O
being O
overly O
optimistic O
in O
what O
they O
can O
actually O
deliver O
. O

Both O
Gore B-PERSON
and O
Bush B-PERSON
rely O
on O
predictions O
from O
the B-ORG
Congressional I-ORG
Budget I-ORG
Office I-ORG
that O
the O

will O
take O

, O
leaving O
$ B-MONEY
2.2 I-MONEY

new O

programs O
. O

Sounds O
good O
, O
but O
many O
economists O
say O
that O
's O
hugely O
optimistic O
because O
of O
economic O
assumptions O
by O
both O
candidates O
that O
wo O
n't O
necessarily O
pan O
out O
. O

For O
example O
, O
government O
spending O
is O
assumed O
by O
the O
candidates O
to O
rise O
only O
at O
the O
rate O
of O
inflation O
, O
while O
, O
in O
truth O
, O
analysts O
say O
it O
's O
been O
rising O
20 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
faster O
than O
that O
. O

Both O
candidates O
also O
assume O
strong O
economic O
growth O
resulting O
in O
that O
huge O
surplus O
. O

The O
truth O
? O

If O
the O
economy O
takes O
a O
major O
hit O
, O
more O
than O
just O
a O
mild O
recession O
, O
experts O
say O
you O
can O
subtract O
