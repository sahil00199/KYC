China B-GPE
's O
judiciary O
basically O
has O
complete O
initiative O
with O

to O
personnel O
appointments O
, O

If O
the O
judiciary O
proposes O
a O
candidate O
and O
the B-ORG
National I-ORG
People I-ORG
's I-ORG
Congress I-ORG
and O
the B-ORG
Party I-ORG
Committee I-ORG
do O
n't O
see O
any O
problem O
, O
the O
candidate O
will O
inevitably O
be O
approved O
and O
appointed O
. O

It O
is O
an O
appropriately O
democratic O
process O
that O
also O
reflects O
the O
independence O
of O
the O
judiciary O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
democracy O
should O
be O
expanded O
further O
in O
the O
future O
. O

However O
, O
abroad O
, O
such O
as O
in O
the O
US B-GPE
, O
it O
is O
administrative O
bodies O
and O
parties O
that O
do O
the O
nominating O

The O
judiciary O
has O
no O
nominating O
power O
at O
all O
. O

When O
US B-NORP
President O
Bush B-PERSON
proposed O
a O
candidate O
for O
supreme O
court O
judge O
, O
he O
first O
nominated O
his O

With O

to O
finances O
, O
each O

China B-GPE

National B-ORG
People I-ORG

can O
supplement O
the O
portion O
of O
funds O
that O
the O
judiciary O
is O
lacking O
. O

Overseas O
, O
such O
as O
in O
the O
US B-GPE
, O
this O
is O
n't O
possible O
at O
all O
. O

In O
any O
country O
, O
the O
judiciary O
ca O
n't O
print O
money O
. O

It O
is O
obliged O
to O
rely O
on O
a O
parliamentary O
resolution O
calling O
for O
the O
government O
to O
allocate O
funds O
. O

These O
in O
fact O
are O
all O
balances O
in O
the O
democratic O
system O
. O

For O
any O
country O
that O
has O
the O
same O
finance O
system O
as O
that O
in O
China B-GPE
, O
it O
is O
just O
a O
bit O
more O
democratic O
in O
China B-GPE
. O

Last O
week O
I O
called O
a O
friend O
who O
's O
recently O
become O
a O
surgeon O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
, O
and O
heard O
something O
that O
I O
'll O
say O
a O
bit O
about O
. O

Basically O
, O
most O
people O
's O
idea O
of O
an O
operation O
is O
nothing O
but O
that O
you O
give O
the O
patient O
an O
anesthetic O
, O
ah O
, O
cut O
him O
open O
, O
take O
out O
the O
bad O
bits O
, O
sew O
him O
up O
, O
and O
it O
's O
over O
. O

That O
's O
when O
you O
meet O
obliging O
people O
. O

But O
there O
are O
some O
people O
in O
this O
world O
who O
are O
just O
not O
that O
obliging O
. O

My O
friend O
had O
the O
luck O
to O
meet O
some O
of O
these O
people O
. O

A O
forty B-CARDINAL
- O
something O
middle O
- O
aged O
man O
was O
going O
to O
have O
an O
operation O
. O

It O
was O
n't O
a O
minor O
operation O
; O
it O
would O
need O
at O
least O
two B-QUANTITY
or O
three B-QUANTITY
hours O
, O
and O
need O
a O
general O
anesthetic O
. O

He O
was O
given O
the O
anesthetic O
, O
and O
, O
hey O
, O
he O
's O
still O
wide O
awake O
, O
chatting O
with O
the O
doctor O
, O
on O
and O
on O
and O
on O
. O

What O
about O
? O

Just O
those O
couple O
of O
last O
night O
's O
World B-EVENT
Cup I-EVENT
games O
were O
such O
and O
so O
forth O
. O

It O
happened O
that O
one B-QUANTITY
of O
the O
doctors O
was O
a O
soccer O
fan O
, O
too O
, O
and O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
just O
began O
chatting O
on O
the O
operating O
table O
. O

But O
no O
one O
can O
stand O
you O
talking O
like O
this O
! O

This O
thing O
takes O
two B-QUANTITY
or O
three B-QUANTITY
hours O
, O
and O
if O
I O
make O
a O
wrong O
cut O
with O
my O
knife O
here O
, O
are O
you O
going O
to O
be O
giving O
me O
an O
end O
- O
of O
- O
year O
bonus O
? O

And O
the O
nurse O
is O
n't O
happy O
, O
either O
, O
-- O
not O
everyone O
is O
a O
sports O
fan O
-- O
and O
just O
by O
coincidence O
she O
has O
just O
had O
a O
fight O
with O
her O
other O
half O
last O
night O
because O
of O
the O
TV O
matter O
. O

The O
doctors O
and O
nurses O
knew O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
story O
quite O
well O
, O
so O
they O
stopped O
right O
away O
after O
they O
saw O
her O
face O
. O

With O
the O
rapid O
economic O
development O
, O
the O
amount O
of O
electronic O
trash O
in O
our O
country O
will O
also O
increase O
rapidly O
at O
the O
annual O
rate O
of O
5 B-PERCENT
- I-PERCENT
10 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
, O

All O
this O
electronic O
waste O
, O
if O
not O
recycled O
and O
treated O
properly O
, O
will O
all O
become O
main O
pollutants O
of O
the O
future O
environment O
and O
will O
have O
enormous O
effects O
on O
the O
development O
of O
the O
economic O
society O
. O

At O
present O
, O
the O
recycling O
and O
treatment O
of O
electronic O
trash O
in O
our O
country O
are O
in O
a O
situation O
in O
which O
they O
are O
suffering O
from O
problems O
both O
at O
home O
and O
abroad O
. O

Not O
only O
a O
large O
amount O
of O
electronic O
trash O
is O
generated O
at O
home O
each O
year O
, O
an O
invasion O
of O
foreign O
electronic O
trash O
is O
also O
encountered O
. O

According O
to O
statistics O
, O
of O
the O
shocking O
amount O
of O
the O
world O
's O
electronic O
trash O
, O
80 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
are O
shipped O
to O
Asia B-LOC
, O
and O
among O
them O
90 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
are O
discarded O
in O
China B-GPE
. O

Calculated O
this O
way O
, O
in O
recent O
years O
our O
country O
has O
to O
take O
in O
more O
than O
70 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
the O
electronic O
trash O
in O
the O
whole O
world B-LOC
annually O
. O

Experts O
told O
the O
writer O
that O
most O
materials O
of O
electronic O
trash O
contain O
harmful O
substances O
such O
as O
lead O
, O
mercury O
, O
tin O
, O
cadmium O
, O
and O
others O
. O

If O
not O
properly O
treated O
, O
these O
substances O
will O
bring O
serious O
pollution O
to O
the O
environment O
. O

The O
disposal O
is O
in O
a O
state O
of O
supervision O
vacuum O
, O
and O
it O
really O
hurts O
to O
think O
that O
the O
large O
amount O
of O
electronic O
trash O
in O
our O
country O
is O
in O
a O
state O
of O
supervision O
vacuum O
. O

According O
to O
reports O
, O
in O
recent O
days O
the O
city O
of O
Changsha B-GPE
has O
used O
24 B-CARDINAL
karat O
gold O
to O
re-case O
a O
7.1 B-QUANTITY
m O
tall O
statue O
of O
Mao B-PERSON
Zedong I-PERSON
and O
, O
to O
form O
a O
complete O
set O
, O
also O
has O
constructed O
a O
four B-QUANTITY
- I-QUANTITY
thousand I-QUANTITY
- O
square O
- O
meter O
Gold B-WORK_OF_ART
Statue I-WORK_OF_ART
Square I-WORK_OF_ART
to O
provide O
people O
a O
place O
to O
commemorate O
and O
relax O
. O

Upon O
hearing O
this O
I O
felt O
that O
if O
a O
regular O
statue O
is O
being O
provided O
for O
paying O
respects O
, O
then O
what O
positive O
effect O
does O
painting O
it O
again O
with O
a O
layer O
of O
gold O
have O
? O

After O
the O
end O
of O
the B-EVENT
Cultural I-EVENT
Revolution I-EVENT
, O
the O
idolized O
position O
of O
Mao B-PERSON
underwent O
massive O
changes O
. O

Along O
with O
the O
taking O
down O
of O
Mao B-PERSON
's O
statues O
that O
filled O
the O
avenues O
in O
every O
region O
, O
or O
moving O
them O
to O
unnoticeable O
locations O
, O
old O
Mao B-PERSON
, O
the O
unassailable O
god O
, O
had O
become O
a O
mortal O
once O
again O
. O

But O
that O
is O
not O
to O
say O
that O
Mao B-PERSON
had O
stepped O
down O
from O
the O
altar O
. O

The O
ubiquitous O
Mao B-PERSON
- O
related O
glitz O
and O
graffiti O
have O
demonstrated O
this O
point O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
people O
of O
any O
era O
in O
history O
would O
identify O
with O
the O
misery O
that O
leader O
worship O
has O
caused O
for O
society O
and O
the O
common O
people O
. O

From O
ancient O
times O
, O
a O
unique O
characteristic O
of O
mankind O
has O
been O
idol O
- O
worship O
. O

But O
for O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
, O
following O
the O
birth O
of O
Confucian B-NORP
ethics O
, O
the O
object O
of O
worship O
has O
often O
not O
been O
those O
unfathomable O
spirits O
, O
but O
rather O
living O
and O
breathing O
mortals O
who O
have O
been O
deified O
. O

These O
without O
a O
doubt O
were O
extremely O
beneficial O
to O
a O
young O
- O
aged O
girl O
to O
the O
extent O
that O
marrying O
a O
foreigner O
became O
popular O
and O
fashionable O
. O

Latecomers O
outstripped O
their O
predecessors O
and O
most O
actually O
did O
n't O
think O
twice O
about O
it O
. O

When O
they O
met O
a O
tall O
- O
nosed O
and O
blue O
- O
eyed O
man O
, O
sparks O
would O
always O
be O
ignited O
within O
the O
next O
three B-QUANTITY
or I-QUANTITY
five I-QUANTITY
days O
. O

What O
is O
pitiful O
about O
Chinese B-NORP
women O
is O
that O
they O
know O
the O
men O
of O
their O
own O
race O
too O
well O
. O

There O
is O
none O
of O
that O
beauty O
that O
comes O
from O
distance O
. O

So O
they O
give O
up O
what O
is O
near O
to O
seek O
what O
is O
far O
away O
. O

If O
you O
conscientiously O
study O
the O
emotional O
traits O
of O
Chinese B-NORP
and O
western B-NORP
men O
, O
you O
will O
find O
that O
Chinese B-NORP
men O
are O
the O
most O
worthy O
of O
marrying O
. O

The O
emotions O
of O
Chinese B-NORP
men O
lack O
a O
little O
romance O
, O
but O
instead O
are O
thick O
and O
solid O
. O

Their O
direction O
is O
specific O
and O
definite O
. O

They O
follow O
one O
of O
the O
world O
's O
common O
truths O
that O
things O
will O
turn O
around O
when O
they O
become O
extreme O
. O

Chinese B-NORP
men O
truly O
understand O
the O
meaning O
of O
the O
three B-QUANTITY
words O
" O
I O
love O
you O
. O
" O

They O
not O
only O
imply O
a O
deep O
emotion O
of O
attachment O
but O
, O
even O
more O
, O
devotion O
and O
true O
love O
. O

It O
enters O
a O
realm O
that O
is O
deeper O
and O
broader O
than O
just O
man O
and O
woman O
. O

It O
is O
the O
crystallization O
of O
life O
after O
it O
has O
been O
melted O
down O
, O
concentrated O
into O
three B-QUANTITY
words O
. O

Thus O
of O
course O
, O
it O
is O
not O
like O
when O
foreigners O
know O
you O
for O
three B-QUANTITY
days O
and O
then O
they O
lavish O
praise O
on O
you O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
foreigners O
also O
have O
deep O
feelings O
. O

But O
when O
it O
lacks O
that O
level O
, O
things O
seem O
to O
lack O
seriousness O
somewhat O
after O
all O

This O
early O
morning O
the O
soccer O
match O
between O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
women O
's O
team O
and O
the O
Korean B-NORP
team O
had O
indeed O
made O
me O
excited O
, O
I O
was O
surprised O
by O
the O
match O
's O
brilliance O
, O
and O
I O
also O
gained O
a O
new O
understanding O
of O
the O
Korean B-NORP
team O
. O

They O
attacked O
swiftly O
and O
fearlessly O
and O
coordinated O
with O
tacit O
understanding O
, O
but O
looking O
back O
at O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
women O
's O
soccer O
team O
, O
it O
was O
in O
an O
inferior O
position O
either O
in O
time O
- O
control O
or O
coordination O
. O

We O
lost O
this O
game O
with O
no O
complaints O
. O

But O
looking O
at O
the O
match O
between O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
men O
's O
soccer O
team O
and O
the O
Iranians B-NORP
, O
that O
goal O
-- O
the O
insulting O
, O
provocative O
, O
and O
perverse O
goal O
-- O
made O
me O
question O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
Iranian B-NORP
team O
and O
even O
of O
the O
people O
in O
that O
country O
. O

The O
Chinese B-NORP
team O
showed O
their O
guts O
during O
this O
game O
; O
they O
manifested O
the O
courage O
and O
fighting O
spirit O
of O
Chinese B-NORP
people O
. O

We O
did O
not O
shy O
away O
from O
the O
powerful O
Iranian B-NORP
team O
, O
but O
did O
our O
best O
; O
it O
was O
n't O
until O
after O
an O
overtime O
and O
two B-QUANTITY
rounds O
of O
penalty O
kicks O
that O
we O
then O
regretfully O
lost O
the O
match O
. O

Let O
us O
remember O
the O
Iranian B-NORP
team O
, O
remember O
this O
Iranian B-NORP
player O
who O
scored O
this O
goal O
-- O
Borhani B-PERSON
. O

The O
IOC B-ORG
warriors O
return O
to O
our O
motherland O
with O
hope O
. O

I O
believe O
there O
will O
eventually O
be O
a O
day O
when O
we O
will O

avenge O
