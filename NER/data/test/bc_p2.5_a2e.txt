May B-PERSON
, O
you O
made O
reference O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
this O
meeting O
to O
the O
butcher O
child O
or O
the O
Turbini B-PERSON
in O
Egypt O
. O

What O
are O
the O
details O
? O

Well O
, O
he O
is O
nicknamed O
, O
uh O
, O
uh O
, O
like O
this O
, O
Turbini B-PERSON
, O
and O
he O
is O
the O
leader O
of O
a O
murderous O
gang O
in O
Egypt B-GPE
, O
and O
he O
has O
chosen O
the O
railroad O
tracks O
as O
the O
stage O
for O
his O
crimes O
. O

In O
any O
case O
, O
we O
selected O
from O
the O
Qatari B-NORP
newspaper O
Al B-ORG
- I-ORG
Watan I-ORG
, O
uh O
, O
Amal O
, O
an O
article O
entitled O
The B-WORK_OF_ART
Fourth I-WORK_OF_ART
Class I-WORK_OF_ART
in I-WORK_OF_ART
Egypt I-WORK_OF_ART
: I-WORK_OF_ART
the I-WORK_OF_ART
Street I-WORK_OF_ART
Children I-WORK_OF_ART
by O
Habashi B-PERSON
Rushdi I-PERSON
, O
and O
he O
discusses O
, O
uh O
, O
the O
causes O
of O
the O
appearance O
of O
such O
gangs O
and O
such O
children O
, O
uh O
, O
in O
Egypt B-GPE
. O

The O
writer O
, O
uh O
, O
says O
that O
this O
class O
, O
the O
Fourth O
Class O
, O
is O
not O
from O
families O
like O
the O
three O
traditional O
classes O
, O
and O
their O
armies O
, O
who O
live O
in O
the O
open O
air O
also O
live O
in O
a O
wilderness O
of O
ethical O
values O
, O
so O
there O
is O
no O
discipline O
, O
and O
no O
upbringing O
. O

And O
what O
is O
striking O
in O
this O
matter O
is O
that O
it O
is O
an O
extension O
of O
the O
class O
of O
poor O
people O
who O
live O
in O
chaotic O
neighborhoods O
that O
are O
never O
reached O
by O
the O
helping O
hand O
of O
the O
government O
. O

And O
only O
as O
a O
reminder O
, O
May B-PERSON
, O
the O
streets O
of O
Egyptian B-NORP
cities O
encompass O
two B-QUANTITY
million I-QUANTITY
children O
who O
are O
runaways O
from O
their O
families O
, O
according O
to O
the O
latest O
statistics O
; O
a O
very O
large O
number O
, O
May B-PERSON
. O

yes O
, O
you O
know O
, O
he O
also O
says O
, O
uh O
, O
the O
author O
, O
that O
the O
Egyptian B-NORP
street O
, O
uh O
, O
abandons O
those O
with O
apathy O
to O
unknowingly O
create O
the O
most O
hardened O
criminals O
, O
whose O
crimes O
will O
soon O
make O
the O
headlines O
of O
the O
events O
pages O
of O
the O
newspapers O
. O

He O
goes O
on O
, O
By O
putting O
the O
underlying O
origin O
of O
the O
, O
uh O
, O
street O
children O
class O
in O
Egypt B-GPE
under O
the O
microscope O
, O
you O
will O
find O
that O
one O
of O
the O
most O
dangerous O
reasons O
behind O
their O
growth O
is O
the O
chaotic O
migration O
from O
the O
countryside O
to O
the O
cities O
, O
and O
to O
a O
certain O
extent O
, O
the O
ruralization O
of O
the O
cities O
and O
the O
urbanization O
of O
the O
countryside O
. O

And O
-- O

Yes O
, O
the O
unfortunate O
thing O
too O
in O
all O
of O
this O
, O
May B-PERSON
, O
is O
that O
millions O
among O
the O
wealthy O
are O
lost O
in O
deep O
sleep O
while O
there O
are O
millions O
of O
children O
out O
in O
the O
streets O
. O

Uh O
, O
yes O
, O
well O
, O
and O
uh O
, O
also O
here O
the O
author O
says O
: O
What O
is O
required O
is O
not O
for O
the O
police O
to O
put O
these O
children O
in O
youth O
shelters O
for O
them O
to O
escape O
and O
go O
back O
to O
the O
streets O
, O
because O
the O
children O
have O
searched O
by O
themselves O
for O
freedom O
they O
did O
not O
have O
in O
their O
families O
, O
so O
they O
resorted O
to O
the O
streets O
, O
so O
do O
not O
save O
their O
lives O
by O
using O
the O
police O
, O
but O
through O
social O
fathers O
and O
mothers O
who O
will O
return O
them O
to O
their O
families O
and O
provide O
their O
families O
with O
security O
and O
safety O
and O
correct O
the O
life O
of O
every O
child O
among O
them O
. O

And O
in O
following O
up O
on O
the O
situation O
in O
Lebanon B-GPE
, O
we O
are O
joined O
by O
our O
correspondent O
there O
, O
Mohammed B-PERSON
Gharib I-PERSON
. O

Mohammed B-PERSON
, O
to O
begin O
with O
, O
uh O
, O
and O
after O
the O
latest O
statements O
by O
Fouad B-PERSON
Siniora I-PERSON
and O
also O
the O
address O
given O
by O
Sayyed B-PERSON
Hassan I-PERSON
Nasrallah I-PERSON
to O
the O
opposition O
and O
to O
all O
the O
Lebanese B-NORP
, O
has O
the O
political O
debate O
between O
the O
authorities O
and O
the O
opposition O
entered O
a O
phase O
of O
dangerous O
disclosures O
in O
your O
opinion O
? O

Well O
, O
yeah O
, O
this O
is O
apparently O
the O
case O
yeah O
, O
Laure B-PERSON
. O

But O
, O
yeah O
, O
the O
doors O
of O
dialogue O
, O
in O
all O
cases O
so O
far O
as O
the O
two O
sides O
are O
saying O
, O
remain O
open O
. O

Umm O
. O

Yeah O
, O
but O
the O
opposition O
in O
return O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
yeah O
, O
says O
that O
any O
dialogue O
uh O
, O
uh O
, O
at O
least O
if O
, O
yeah O
, O
yeah O
, O
it O
takes O
place O
between O
the O
two O
sides O
, O
will O
only O
be O
alongside O
the O
popular O
opinion O
. O

That O
is O
, O
the O
opposition O
so O
far O
is O
saying O
that O
the O
street O
is O
the O
main O
path O
to O
, O
yeah O
, O
yeah O
, O
changing O
the O
government O
. O

And O
here O
, O
I O
have O
to O
point O
out O
that O
there O
is O
a O
fallacy O
, O
it O
seems O
that O
the O
media O
people O
-- O

the O
opposition O
is O
so O
far O
at O
the O
stage O
of O
demanding O
a O
change O
in O
the O
government O
and O
not O
the O
toppling O
of O
the O
government O
, O
which O
means O
that O
it O
is O
demanding O
a O
national O
unity O
government O
, O
yeah O
, O
yeah O
, O
or O
a O
change O
in O
the O
government O
through O
, O
yeah O
, O
yeah O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
yeah O
, O
keeping O
Prime O
Minister O
Siniora B-PERSON
as O
Prime O
Minister O
and O
some O
of O
the O
current O
ministers O
, O
provided O
that O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
an O
agreement O
is O
reached O
to O
add O
some O
ministers O
to O
this O
current O
government O
. O

Yes O
. O

Well O
, O
Mohammed B-PERSON
, O
uh O
, O
there O
is O
little O
hope O
, O
uh O
, O
on O
the O
issue O
of O
dialogue O
. O

Ah O
undoubtedly O
ah O
a O
very O
hasty O
project O
, O
especially O
that O
the B-GPE
Hebrew I-GPE
State I-GPE
tried O
to O
implement O
this O
project O
alone O
, O
from O
the B-LOC
Mediterranean I-LOC
Sea I-LOC
to O
the B-LOC
Red I-LOC
Sea I-LOC
. O

And O
it O
was O
proved O
to O
them O
with O
certainty O
that O
the O
project O
is O
ineffective O
economically O
, O
as O
it O
will O
cost O
one B-MONEY
and I-MONEY
a I-MONEY
half I-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
. O

So O
they O
tried O
using O
their O
well O
- O
known O
means O
to O
transfer O
this O
project O
to O
another O
agency O
to O
implement O
it O
and O
finance O
it O
, O
while O
they O
reap O
the O
fruits O
from O
it O
. O

Aha O
, O
aha O
. O

They O
have O
many O
goals O
ah O
for O
such O
a O
project O
, O
the O
most O
important O
of O
which O
is O
to O
build O
one O
hundred O
new O
settlements O
they O
have O
been O
planning O
to O
establish O
in O
the O
Negev B-LOC
. O

Ah O
. O

But O
now O
the O
fear O
is O
that O
they O
plan O
to O
build O
them O
across O
the O
extension O
of O
the O
new O
canal O
line O
from O
the B-LOC
Red I-LOC
Sea I-LOC
to O
the B-LOC
Dead I-LOC
Sea I-LOC
under O
various O
headers O
, O
including O
the O
headers O
ah O
of O
development O
and O
architecture O
and O
ah O
establishing O
new O
settlements O
. O

And O
since O
the O
subject O
has O
become O
open O
in O
Jordan B-GPE
for O
everyone O
, O
there O
is O
no O
guarantee O
that O
the O
new O
construction O
projects O
that O
would O
be O
established O
on O
this O
line O
might O
reach O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
Zionists B-NORP
. O

Aha O
. O

And O
they O
might O
repeat O
the O
story O
as O
they O
started O
it O
in O
Palestine B-GPE
by O
building O
settlements O
, O
and O
the O
eastern O
mountains O
will O
become O
occupied O
to O
the O
Dead B-LOC
Sea I-LOC
and O
Araba B-LOC
Valley I-LOC
, O
occupied O
by O
the O
Zionists B-NORP
. O

Aha O
, O
aha O
. O

This O
project O
is O
extremely O
dangerous O
, O
except O
-- O

would O
n't O
it O
also O
contribute O
to O
completely O
connect O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
and O
Jordanian B-NORP
economy O
to O
the O
Israeli B-NORP
I O
mean O
, O
what O
generates O
from O
it O
, O
may O
be O
, O
of O
demographic O
, O
economic O
and O
development O
projects O
. O

Yes O
, O
more O
than O
this O
, O
I O
say O
ah O
this O
project O
is O
one O
of O
the O
American B-NORP
- O
Israeli B-NORP
projects O
in O
the O
region O
which O
aim O
in O
the O
end O
at O
incorporating O
ah O
Israel B-GPE
in O
the O
Jordanian B-NORP
society O
and O
in O
the O
Arab B-NORP
society O
ah O
and O
marketing O
it O
in O
this O
way O
. O

Huge O
tremendous O
joint O
projects O
ah O
ah O
that O
guarantee O
the O
security O
and O
stability O
of O
the O
region O
as O
it O
is O
said O
, O
but O
they O
will O
bring O
us O
very O
big O
losses O
. O

Aha O
-- O

This O
project O
has O
engineering O
damages O
, O
environmental O
damages O
, O
military O
damages O
and O
political O
damages O
on O
Jordanian B-NORP
society O
. O

Yes O
, O
okay O
, O
Sir O
the O
report O
called O
for O
dialog O
with O
Syria B-GPE
and O
Iran B-GPE
, O
but O
Bush B-PERSON
doubted O
neighboring O
countries O
' O
taking O
part O
in O
the O
talks O
at O
an O
international O
conference O
to O
support O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

Does O
n't O
this O
contradict O
the O
administration O
's O
approach O
to O
dealing O
with O
the O
Baker B-PERSON
- O
Hamilton B-PERSON
report O
? O

Yes O
, O
first O
let O
me O
explain O
. O

There O
is O
a O
call O
for O
an O
international O
conference O
and O
there O
is O
a O
call O
for O
a O
regional O
conference O
. O

the O
international O
conference O
, O
it O
appears O
that O
the O
Bush B-PERSON
administration O
is O
not O
encouraged O
and O
is O
not O
enthusiastic O
about O
it O
. O

Abdul B-PERSON
Aziz I-PERSON
Al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Hakim I-PERSON
expressed O
this O
when O
he O
was O
in O
Washington B-GPE
this O
position O
as O
did O
Iraqi B-NORP
President O
Talabani B-PERSON
. O

But O
what O
is O
striking O
is O
that O
there O
is O
a O
possibility O
uh O
for O
a O
call O
for O
a O
regional O
conference O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
this O
, O
uh O
, O
is O
being O
encouraged O
by O
Washington B-ORG
and O
perhaps O
through O
this O
conference O
, O
there O
will O
be O
a O
way O
in O
for O
, O
uh O
, O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
of I-GPE
America I-GPE
to O
talk O
to O
Syria B-GPE
and O
Iran B-GPE
. O

Syria B-GPE
and O
Iran B-GPE
will O
of O
course O
be O
involved O
in O
this O
regional O
conference O
should O
it O
be O
held O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
would O
be O
wise O
and O
it O
would O
not O
be O
objective O
not O
to O
invite O
them O
to O
a O
conference O
dealing O
with O
Iraq B-GPE
's O
regional O
neighbors O
. O

The O
question O
is O
about O
the O
American B-NORP
position O
. O

Will O
Washington B-ORG
take O
this O
conference O
as O
a O
way O
of O
initiating O
a O
dialog O
with O
Syria B-GPE
and O
Iran B-GPE
or O
will O
it O
content O
itself O
with O
Syria B-GPE
and O
Iran B-GPE
's O
participation O
being O
simply O
the O
outer O
limits O
or O
upper O
ceiling O
for O
talks O
with O
Syria B-GPE
and O
Iran B-GPE
at O
this O
stage O
? O

Yes O
, O
from O
Washington B-GPE

Mr. O
Subhi B-PERSON
Ghandour I-PERSON
