I O

in O

they O
had O
every O
reason O

suspect O

the O

was O
caused O
by O

The O

including O
one B-CARDINAL
from O
an O
Army B-ORG
officer O
working O

that O

Many O

suspicious O
that O
the O

and O
that O
the O

That O
craft O
that O
approached O
the O
Cole B-PRODUCT
is O
a O
rubber O
boat O
, O
not O
a O
big O

, O
but O
they O
would O
have O
had O
to O
pack O

do O
the O
amount O

that O
they O

it O

Still O
, O
she O

would O
take O
appropriate O
action O
if O

were O
found O

a O

If O
, O
as O
it O
now O
appears O

this O

it O

in O
1983 B-DATE

at O

was O
involving O

at O
that O
point O
in O
Lebanon B-GPE
now O
with O
the O

where O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE

was O
also O
attempting O
actively O
to O
provide O
some O
stabilizing O
influence O
and O
unfortunately O
and O
tragically O
got O
caught O
up O
in O
the O
maelstrom O
and O
that O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
salient O
fact O
of O
this O
attack O
. O

And O
if O
this O
attack O
turns O
out O
to O
be O
the O
work O
of O
terrorists O
, O
Hoffman B-PERSON
says O
it O
would O
signal O
a O
dangerous O
new O
trend O
. O

Maritime O
or O
marine O
- O
borne O
terrorist O
attacks O
are O
actually O
quite O
rare O
. O

That O
being O
said O
it O
could O
well O
be O
the O
beginning O
of O
a O
new O
pattern O

We O
have O
made O
it O

more O

so O
, O
for O
terrorists O
to O
attack O
our O
ground O
forces O
in O
the B-LOC
Arabian I-LOC

So O
, O
I O
think O
terrorists O
prevented O
from O
attacking O
their O
targets O
using O
their O
more O
conventional O
means O
` O
truck O
bombs O
' O
have O
merely O
adjusted O
their O
tactics O
slightly O

obviously O
they O
have O
been O
successful O
with O

's O
shoes O
even O
on O
stage O
, O
was O
quite O
a O
temptation O
says O
Yubitrich B-PERSON

I O
always O
felt O
when O
I O
enter O
his O
person O

Okay O

that O
I O
can O
do O
whatever O
I O
want O
and O
I O
always O
molested O
our O
fellow O
players O
you O
know O
. O

So O
being O
Milosevic B-PERSON
is O
something O
which O
I O
can O
compare O
to O
taking O
a O
dangerous O
drug O
. O

We O

We O
will O
have O
plenty O

Political O
satirical O

something O

you O
can O
apply O

to O

which O

We O
are O
still O
in O

and O
we O
will O
be O
I O
think O
for O
a O
while O
, O
but O
the O
current O
crisis O
Jonetic B-PERSON
hopes O
will O
at O

be O
one B-CARDINAL
where O

not O

mostly O
on O

a O

and O
now O
in O
that O
new O
freedom O
of O
the O
life O
in O
front O

him O
, O
he O
takes O
to O
the O
road O
in O
the O
tradition O

old O
Chinese B-NORP
poets O

records O
what O
he O

what O
he O
hears O

the O
stories O

told O

The O
book O

filled O

marvelous O
descriptions O

the O

through O
which O
he O
walks O

the O
mountains O
that O
he O
climbs O
, O
indeed O
the O
book O
is O
called O
Soul B-WORK_OF_ART
Mountain I-WORK_OF_ART
, O
the O
mountain O
on O
which O
he O
hopes O
in O
some O
way O
or O
another O
to O
get O
in O
touch O
with O
his O
soul O
, O
his O
individual O
soul O
, O
as O
opposed O
to O
that O
mass O
kind O
of O
soul O
being O
enforced O
upon O
him O
by O
the O
Communist B-NORP
Chinese B-NORP
authorities O
, O
the O
social O
realism O
that O
the O
cadres O
would O
have O
him O
write O
in O
. O

Not O
only O
can O
this O
fellow O
write O
, O
he O
can O
paint O
too O
, O
ca O
n't O
he O
? O

He O
is O
best O
known O
among O
his O
neighbors O
in O
Paris B-GPE
as O
a O
painter O
. O

He O
has O
had O
more O
than O
30 B-CARDINAL
one B-CARDINAL
- O
man O
shows O
and O
his O
paintings O
are O
quite O
delicately O
done O
and O
there O
he O
is O
also O
very O
well O
known O
as O
a O
playwright O
. O

I O
think O
he O
has O
published O
about B-CARDINAL
18 I-CARDINAL
plays O
now O
and O
he O
writes O
his O
plays O
in O
French B-LANGUAGE
. O

Just O
one B-CARDINAL
last O
thing O
quoting O
him O
and O
I O
wonder O
if O
you O
could O
respond O
to O
this O
, O
Christopher B-PERSON
, O
he O
said O
at O
the O
very O
beginning O
of O
his O
wonderful O
speech O
to O
the B-ORG
Nobel I-ORG
Prize I-ORG
Committee I-ORG
, O
he O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
do O
not O
wish O
to O
waste O
this O
talk O
on O
literature O
by O
saying O
too O
much O
about O
politics O
and O
history O
, O
What O
I O
want O
to O
do O
is O
to O
use O
this O
opportunity O
to O
speak O
as O
one O
writer O
in O
the O
voice O
of O
an O
individual O
. O
'' O

Is O
that O
true O
basically O
not O
only O
for O
him O
that B-DATE
day I-DATE
, I-DATE
today I-DATE
, O
but O
of O
all O
of O
his O
work O
? O

Well O
, O
the O
work O
that O
we O
have O
so O
far O
in O
English B-LANGUAGE
translation O
suggests O
that O
, O
and O
indeed O
this O
novel O
, O
which O
is O
a O
celebration O
as O
well O
of O
the O
self O
of O
the O
individual O
, O
goes O
so O
far O
as O
to O
even O
divide O
up O
to O
the O
self O
. O

Characters O
proliferate O
out O
of O
the O
imagination O
of O
the O
narrator O
so O
that O
at O
a O
certain O
point O
, O
you O
have O
a O
new O
he O
, O
you O
have O
a O
new O
she O
, O
you O
have O
a O
you O
, O
and O
each O
one O
of O
these O
characters O
tells O
stories O
, O
each O
story O
of O
which O
is O
designed O
to O
give O
you O
a O
deeper O
sense O
of O
the O
richness O
and O
the O
complexity O
of O
life O
in O

met O
today B-DATE

Arab B-NORP
's O
summit O

Egypt B-GPE
called O
the O
emergency O
summit O

declare O
support O

the O
Palestinians B-NORP
in O
the O
wake O

106 I-CARDINAL

almost O

Palestinian B-NORP

at O
Sharm B-GPE
el I-GPE
- I-GPE
Sheikh I-GPE
two B-DATE

under O
pressure O
from O
their O
own O
citizens O
to O
take O
a O
tough O
stance O
against O
Israel B-GPE

James B-PERSON
Drummond I-PERSON
, O
covering O
the O
Arab B-NORP
summit O
in O
Cairo B-GPE
for O
the B-ORG
Financial I-ORG
Times I-ORG
. O

James B-PERSON
, O
there O
's O
a O
reason O
why O
the O
Arabs B-NORP
wanted O
this O
pre-summit O
meeting O
. O

What O
is O
the O
pressure O
on O
them O
prior O
to O
the O
summit O
? O

Well O
, O
I O
think O
they O
want O
to O
try O
and O
iron O
out O
any O
potential O
difficulties O
before O
the O
heads O
of O
state O
come O
into O
town O
on O
Saturday B-DATE
and O
Sunday B-DATE
. O

So O
this O
is O
a O
preparatory O
exercise O
to O
reach O
some O
sort O
of O
agreement O
beforehand O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
the O
problem O
is O
that O
not O
all O
Arab B-NORP
states O
are O
speaking O
again O
with O
one B-CARDINAL
voice O
. O

What O
do O
they O
hope O
to O
achieve O
? O
and O
what O
can O
you O
claim O
from O
the O
statements O
made O
today B-DATE
? O

It O
is O
difficult O
to O
say O
, O
Arab B-NORP
's O
summit O
have O
traditionally O
been O
exercises O
in O
division O
. O

We O
have O
already O
seen O
problems O
from O
Libyan B-NORP
leader O
Muammar B-PERSON
Gaddafi I-PERSON
on O
Tuesday B-DATE
who O
appeared O
on O
Al B-ORG
- I-ORG
Jazeera I-ORG
, O
the O
pan-Arab B-NORP
satellite O
channel O
, O
and O
, O
rubbish O
, O
what O
he O
said O
was O
a O
draft O
statement O
for O
the O
end O
of O
the O
summit O
on O
Sunday B-DATE
. O

And O
he O
was O
very O
categorical O
that O
it O
was O
too O
weak O
and O
did O
not O
harm O
Israeli B-NORP
interests O
sufficiently O
. O

So O
we O
have O
Gadafi B-PERSON
on O
the O
one B-CARDINAL
hand O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
we O
have O
Egypt B-GPE
which O
was O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
Arab B-NORP
country O
to O
make O
peace O
with O
the O
Jewish B-NORP
state O
, O
which O
is O
of O
course O
also O
a O
top O
recipient O
of O
US B-GPE
aid O
. O

The O
Egyptian B-NORP
President O
Hosni B-PERSON
Mubarak I-PERSON
is O
more O
of O
a O
voice O
of O
moderation O
against O
the O
other O
side O
. O

Tell O
us O
about O
what O
he O
has O
been O
saying O
. O

Well O
, O
Mr. O
Mubarak B-PERSON
has O
been O
, O
as O
you O
say O
, O
a O
voice O
of O
moderation O
. O

He O
has O
invested O
an O
awful O
amount O
in O
the O
peace O
with O
Israel B-GPE
, O
and O
really O
he O
can O
not O
afford O
to O
let O
it O
fail O
. O

We O
have O
seen O
some O
more O
power O
techniques O
perhaps O
from O
his O
Foreign O
Minister O
Amre B-PERSON
Moussa I-PERSON
over O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
few I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
, O
but O
Amre B-PERSON
Moussa I-PERSON
today B-DATE
at O
the O
Foreign O
Minister O
's O
meeting O
was O
calling O
simply O
for O
the O
return O
of O
East B-GPE
Jerusalem I-GPE
to O
the O
Palestinians B-NORP
, O
in O
stark O
contrast O
to O
Syrian B-NORP
Foreign O
Minister O
Faruq B-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Shara I-PERSON
who O
was O
pulling O
for O
a O
complete O
cut O
in O
diplomatic O
relations O
between O
Israel B-GPE
and O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
Arab B-NORP
states O
that O
happen O
. O

So O
Egypt B-GPE
is O
playing O
a O
calming O
role O
. O

It O
will O
not O
want O
to O
see O
anything O
too O
strong O
coming O
out O
of O
this O
summit O
due O
to O
end O
on O
Sunday B-DATE
. O

What O
seemed O
to O
be O
the O
prevailing O
voices O
at O
this O
point O
? O

There O
are O
certainly O
calls O
for O
war O
against O
Israel B-GPE
. O

Is O
there O
much O
support O
for O
that O
? O

Well O
, O
actually O
President O
Mubarak B-PERSON
was O
very O
categorical O
today B-DATE
in O
condemning O
calls O
for O
war O
, O
which O
he O
said O
were O
very O
serious O
and O
people O
should O
understand O
the O
implications O
of O
just O
what O
it O
meant O
. O

Egypt B-GPE
and O
Jordan B-GPE
do O
not O
want O
to O
see O
any O
sort O
of O
conventional O
war O
against O
Israel B-GPE
. O

They O
have O
both O
invested O
enormous O
amounts O
in O
it O
, O
and O
both O
regimes O
would O
be O
more O
vulnerable O
if O
the O
peace O
process O
were O
to O
fail O
, O
because O
detractors O
and O
opponents O
within O
each O
country O
would O
have O
ammunition O
by O
which O
to O
fire O
at O
them O
. O

How O
much O
is O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
entering O
into O
the O
conversation O
and O
how O
much O
pressure O
seems O
to O
be O
coming O
from O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
? O

Well O
today O
not O
too O
much O
. O

I O
mean O
Madeleine B-PERSON
Albright I-PERSON
was O
in O
Saudi B-GPE
Arabia I-GPE
yesterday B-DATE
where O
she O
met O
with O
crown O
prince O
Abdullah B-PERSON
and O
the O
new O
Syrian B-NORP
President O
Bashar B-PERSON
Al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Assad I-PERSON
. O

Interestingly O
enough O
she O
is O
quoted O
as O
telling O
General O
Sanholi B-PERSON
back O
to O
the O
US B-GPE
that O
she O
did O
not O
really O
get O
too O
much O
of O
a O
reception O
from O
Bashar B-PERSON
Al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Assad I-PERSON
in O
terms O
of O
lightening O
the O
traditionally O
antagonistic O
Syrian B-NORP
align O
towards O
Israel B-GPE
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
did O
meet O
with O
Bashar B-PERSON
Al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Assad I-PERSON
and O
it O
was O
n't O
Saudi B-GPE
Arabia I-GPE
which O
is O
traditionally O
being O
more O
dovish O
and O
has O
supported O
US B-GPE
policy O
, O
it O
is O
significant O
. O

So O
, O
as O
of O
today B-DATE
, O
I O
would O
say O
certainly O
on O
the O
surface O
there O
has O
been O
little O
US B-GPE
action O
. O

Well O
, O
thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
the O
update O
. O

make O

They O

They O

, O
you O

and O
they O
have O
got O

they O
know O
how O
to O
handle O
it O
. O

But O
Positive B-ORG
Black I-ORG
Soul I-ORG
's I-ORG
music O
is O
first B-ORDINAL
and O
foremost O
Senegalese B-NORP
music O
. O

When O
American B-NORP
saxophonist O
David B-PERSON
Murray I-PERSON
recorded O
his O
acclaimed O
afrocentric O
jazz O
album O
, O
Fo B-WORK_OF_ART
Juke I-WORK_OF_ART
Review I-WORK_OF_ART
in O
Dakar B-GPE
, O
he O
recruited O
Amidu B-PERSON
Berry I-PERSON
and O
DJ B-PERSON
Awadi I-PERSON
from O
PBS B-ORG
to O
show O
what O
an O
edge O
West B-NORP
African I-NORP
music O
can O
really O
have O
. O

When O
Awadi B-PERSON
and O
Barry B-PERSON
performed O
, O
they O
managed O
simultaneously O
to O
bathe O
in O
the O
group O
of O
American B-NORP
hip O
- O
hop O
and O
they O
keep O
a O
clear O
sense O
that O
they O
are O
from O
Senegal B-GPE
. O

This O
connection O
to O
national O
and O
musical O
identities O
results O
partly O
from O
the O
fact O
that O
many O
Senegalese B-NORP
artists O
want O
to O
stay O
in O
Senegal B-GPE
to O
live O
and O
work O
says O
PBS B-ORG
singer O
Tidia B-PERSON
Awadi I-PERSON
. O

It O
is O
because O
they O
know O
they O
have O
the O
inspiration O
in O
their O
country O
. O

I O
think O
everybody O
want O
to O
stay O
in O
his O
country O
, O
want O
to O
die O
in O
his O
country O
. O

If O
you O
can O
stay O
and O
make O
it O
happen O
, O
the O
place O
where O
you O
was O
born O
, O
where O
you O
grew O
up O
then O
try O
to O
make O
it O
there O
. O

It O
's O
possible O
. O

Senegalese B-NORP
rappers O
are O
also O
identified O
by O
what O
they O
say O
in O
their O
tracks O
. O

Western B-NORP
hip O
- O
hop O
lyrics O
often O
revolve O
around O
the O
accumulation O
of O
material O
wealth O
and O
throwing O
parties O
. O

PBS B-ORG
and O
other O
Senegalese B-NORP
rap O
groups O
have O
different O
concerns O
. O

In O
the O
grim O
lyrics O
to O
Leboho B-WORK_OF_ART
Inwa I-WORK_OF_ART
, O
the O
executioner O
is O
black O
. O

PBS B-ORG
raps O
that O
Africans B-NORP
are O
their O
worst O
enemies O
. O

Front O
man O
Amidu B-PERSON
Barry I-PERSON
may O
look O
like O
he O
got O
his O
moves O
on O
the O
streets O
of O
Brooklyn B-GPE
but O
his O
critique O
of O
post-colonial O
finger O
pointing O
in O
Africa B-LOC
tells O
a O
different O
story O
. O

You O
know O
, O
in O
Africa B-LOC
every O
time O
you O
know O
something O
bad O
happens O
, O
everybody O
like O
you O
know O
is O
because O
of O
the O
white O
man O
, O
you O
know O
the O
colonization O
, O
the O
slavery O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
realize O
that O
you O
know O
the O
real O
execution O
is O
really O
black O
's O
black O
like O
them O
. O

So O
before O
they O
say O
it O
is O
a O
white O
man O
tangle O
you O
know O
it O
's O
because O
of O
a O
white O
man O
that O
this O
happens O
and O
they O
got O
to O
, O
you O
know O
, O
check O
around O
and O
they O
say O
who O
is O
the O
real O
guilty O
. O

We O
got O
to O
accept O
it O
and O
try O
to O
, O
you O
know O
, O
change O
the O
things O
, O
make O
the O

better O
