No O

a O

for O
some O
Americans B-NORP

a O

for O

anyone O

We O
asked O
Judy B-PERSON

if O

like O
to O
do O
the O

a O

okay O

This O

the O

The O

The O

The O

in O

A O

He O

it O

The O

the O

that O
it O

go O

that O

but O
even O
if O
the O
violence O
subsides O
, O
Israelis B-NORP

Palestinians B-NORP
will O
still O
have O
to O
deal O
with O
an O
open O
wound O
-- O
a O
scar O
so O
long O
and O
so O
deep O
from O
these B-DATE
last I-DATE
two I-DATE

it O
may O
be O

there O

a O

peace O
again O

Both O

have O
almost O
stepped O
back O
six B-DATE
years I-DATE
in O

their O

, O
six B-DATE
years I-DATE

more I-DATE
-- O
before O
the B-LAW
Oslo I-LAW

, O
when O
the O
Israelis B-NORP
promised O

the O
Palestinians B-NORP
promised O

Today B-DATE
there O
is O
only O
finger O
pointing O
. O

Arafat B-PERSON
deliberately O
launched O
it O
in O
order O
to O
attract O
the O
attention O
of O
the O
world O
by O
paying O
with O
the O
blood O
of O
his O
own O
people O
. O

I O
urge O
Mr. O
Barak B-PERSON
to O
lift O
the O
siege O
of O
Palestinians B-NORP
, O
to O
speak O
to O
the O
Palestinians B-NORP
as O
its O
neighbors O
because O
they O
are O
his O
neighbors O
. O

The O
Palestinians B-NORP
clearly O
face O
the O
greatest O
pressure O
in O
this O
summit O
, O
since O
the O
Israelis B-NORP
are O
not O
the O
only O
ones O
blaming O
them O
for O
the O
outbreak O
of O
violence O
. O

I O
think O
we O
all O
know O
that O
Arafat B-PERSON
is O
in O
charge O
of O
the B-ORG
Palestinian I-ORG
Authority I-ORG
. O

He O
has O
the O
responsibility O
for O
controlling O
the O
violence O
. O

But O
it O
may O
not O
be O
so O
easy O
for O
Arafat B-PERSON
. O

Today B-DATE
, O
thousands B-CARDINAL
of O
Palestinians B-NORP
are O
calling O
for O
continued O
fighting O
. O

Half B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
population O
is O
under O
the B-DATE
age I-DATE
of I-DATE
14 I-DATE
and O
many O
have O
been O
influenced O
by O
military O
factions O
like O
Hamas B-ORG
and O
Hezbollah B-ORG
-- O
not O
by O
Arafat B-PERSON
. O

When O
you O
talk O
about O
Arafat B-PERSON
and O
the O
people O
around O
him O
, O
you O
have O
to O
understand O
how O
young O
this O

really O
is O
-- O
how O
volatile O
, O
how O
close O
