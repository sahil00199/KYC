The O
Russian O
police O
have O
said O
that O
Litvinenko O
, O
the O
defected O
Russian O
spy O
who O
was O
fatally O
poisoned O
, O
could O
have O
died O
because O
of O
a O
high O
level O
of O
business O
competition O
. O

But O
based O
on O
information O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
British O
police O
and O
Litvinenko O
's O
final O
denunciation O
before O
his O
death O
, O
the O
focus O
of O
the O
investigation O
has O
locked O
onto O
the O
possibility O
that O
it O
was O
a O
political O
assassination O
involving O
the O
Russian O
security O
agency O
. O

Russian O
police O
revealed O
that O
while O
he O
was O
alive O
, O
after O
he O
fled O
to O
England O
, O
Litvinenko O
was O
taken O
on O
by O
Erinys O
, O
a O
British O
company O
, O
where O
he O
was O
responsible O
for O
employee O
training O
. O

The O
international O
company O
is O
in O
charge O
of O
security O
for O
the O
petroleum O
industry O
and O
has O
more O
than O
ten O
thousand O
employees O
. O

Russian O
police O
claim O
that O
Erinys O
has O
an O
important O
competitor O
RISC O
. O

The O
last O
people O
Litvinenko O
saw O
while O
he O
was O
alive O
, O
Lugovoi O
and O
his O
friends O
, O
were O
all O
engaged O
in O
these O
industries O
. O

Lugovoi O
is O
also O
a O
client O
of O
RISC O
. O

An O
analysis O
by O
Russian O
police O
states O
that O
Litvinenko O
died O
because O
of O
business O
competition O
. O

Besides O
an O
investigation O
being O
carried O
out O
by O
British O
police O
in O
Russia O
, O
international O
criminal O
police O
organizations O
have O
already O
become O
involved O
. O

The O
share O
of O
the O
spirited O
emerging O
markets O
within O
the O
world O
economy O
is O
growing O
. O

Particularly O
in O
China O
and O
India O
, O
their O
rapid O
growths O
will O
contribute O
to O
the O
maintenance O
of O
the O
world O
economy O
. O

However O
, O
this O
has O
also O
caused O
the O
world O
economy O
to O
become O
increasingly O
sensitive O
to O
the O
economic O
conditions O
of O
these O
countries O
. O

Once O
these O
countries O
suffer O
from O
an O
economic O
downturn O
, O
the O
world O
economy O
-LRB- O
especially O
the O
Asian O
economy O
-RRB- O
will O
also O
be O
greatly O
affected O
. O

The O
intelligence O
unit O
of O
The O
Economist O
of O
Britain O
has O
predicted O
that O
in O
2007 O
, O
U.S. O
economic O
growth O
will O
slow O
down O
significantly O
, O
and O
the O
growth O
rate O
will O
be O
a O
mere O
2 O
% O
. O

This O
is O
largely O
caused O
by O
the O
profound O
changes O
that O
have O
occurred O
in O
America O
's O
housing O
markets O
. O

After O
years O
of O
wild O
increases O
, O
the O
housing O
prices O
and O
trading O
volumes O
of O
real O
estate O
in O
the O
U.S. O
are O
both O
declining O
. O

The O
booming O
housing O
market O
was O
one O
of O
the O
main O
impetuses O
for O
the O
development O
of O
the O
U.S. O
economy O
to O
reach O
its O
climax O
from O
2004 O
to O
2006 O
. O

While O
the O
economies O
of O
Euro O
area O
continued O
to O
warm O
up O
in O
2006 O
, O
they O
are O
expected O
to O
slow O
down O
at O
a O
steady O
pace O
in O
2007 O
. O

Japan O
's O
economy O
developed O
rapidly O
in O
2006 O
, O
but O
it O
is O
also O
likely O
to O
slow O
down O
its O
pace O
of O
increase O
in O
2007 O
and O
2008 O
. O

In O
the O
next O
phase O
, O
Japan O
's O
export O
growth O
will O
slow O
down O
significantly O
. O

The O
emerging O
areas O
in O
Asia O
will O
still O
witness O
the O
most O
rapid O
growth O
, O
where O
the O
growth O
rate O
is O
expected O
to O
parallel O
that O
of O
the O
last O
century O
in O
mid-1990's O
. O

The O
economic O
growth O
of O
India O
and O
the O
Association O
of O
Southeast O
Asian O
Nations O
will O
also O
slow O
down O
slightly O
in O
2007 O
and O
2008 O
. O

China O
's O
economy O
will O
continue O
to O
grow O
robustly O
, O
and O
this O
is O
boosted O
at O
a O
certain O
extent O
by O
the O
overheated O
investment O
in O
specific O
sectors O
. O

Motorcycles O
and O
electric O
cars O
have O
both O
been O
banned O
. O

It O
's O
not O
even O
certain O
if O
we O
can O
take O
a O
bus O
now O
. O

Public O
transportation O
enterprises O
say O
that O
there O
needs O
to O
be O
a O
two O
- O
thirds O
increase O
in O
the O
number O
of O
buses O
if O
they O
are O
not O
going O
to O
be O
" O
overloaded O
" O
. O

One O
can O
well O
imagine O
how O
many O
people O
will O
be O
refused O
entry O
to O
buses O
when O
overloading O
them O
is O
really O
prohibited O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
those O
ordinary O
people O
can O
get O
around O
then O
? O

By O
private O
car O
or O
taxi O
? O

They O
are O
clearly O
unable O
to O
afford O
either O
, O
so O
the O
only O
choice O
left O
for O
them O
is O
to O
choose O
to O
walk O
or O
ride O
a O
bike O
. O

But O
the O
city O
of O
Guangzhou O
is O
so O
big O
that O
getting O
around O
on O
foot O
or O
by O
bike O
will O
be O
an O
extremely O
torturous O
affair O
. O

Every O
citizen O
has O
his O
own O
right O
of O
the O
road O
. O

Citizens O
all O
have O
the O
right O
to O
independently O
choose O
when O
and O
how O
to O
use O
the O
road O
. O

In O
the O
aim O
of O
achieving O
harmony O
and O
order O
in O
city O
traffic O
, O
ordinary O
people O
have O
already O
relinquished O
a O
fairly O
large O
part O
of O
their O
right O
to O
the O
road O
by O
allowing O
wider O
roads O
for O
the O
owners O
of O
private O
cars O
. O

Morally O
speaking O
, O
the O
government O
and O
the O
rich O
should O
actually O
feel O
greatly O
indebted O
to O
them O
. O

But O
the O
truth O
is O
different O
. O

The O
elite O
have O
greatly O
deceived O
the O
people O
and O
with O
insatiable O
avariciousness O
have O
deprived O
ordinary O
people O
of O
the O
pathetic O
little O
remaining O
right O
to O
the O
road O
with O
which O
they O
have O
been O
left O
. O

It O
seems O
that O
in O
their O
eyes O
, O
biking O
or O
walking O
is O
the O
obvious O
choice O
of O
ordinary O
people O
. O

As O
an O
ordinary O
person O
who O
can O
not O
afford O
a O
private O
car O
, O
living O
in O
Guangzhou O
is O
simply O
too O
depressing O
. O

But O
other O
than O
a O
few O
curses O
, O
what O
else O
can O
we O
do O
? O
