Recently O
I O
've O
been O
preparing O
to O
change O
career O
course O
, O
leaving O
the O
stock O
market O
to O
grow O
in O
the O
real O
estate O
industry O
. O

This O
in O
no O
way O
is O
because O
I O
see O
the O
stock O
market O
as O
empty O
and O
the O
real O
estate O
industry O
as O
promising O
, O
but O
because O
I O
think O
that O
at O
this O
moment O
in O
time O
, O
China O
's O
real O
estate O
industry O
more O
than O
the O
stock O
market O
needs O
some O
creative O
financial O
tools O
to O
neutralize O
the O
huge O
risks O
that O
have O
accumulated O
over O
the O
past O
few O
years O
. O

What O
I O
had O
n't O
expected O
was O
that O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
people O
after O
hearing O
about O
my O
decision O
first O
asked O
me O
: O
" O
When O
are O
house O
prices O
going O
to O
fall O
? O
" O

They O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
hear O
my O
reasoning O
, O
instead O
expecting O
me O
to O
sum O
up O
predictions O
in O
real O
estate O
price O
trends O
in O
one O
simple O
sentence O
. O

" O
Just O
like O
you O
predicted O
the O
stock O
market O
, O
how O
you O
often O
said O
' O
No O
bull O
market O
with O
inflation O
' O
, O
that O
kind O
of O
straightforwardness O
" O
. O

I O
understand O
these O
friends O
do O
n't O
really O
care O
about O
the O
intriguing O
framework O
and O
theory O
of O
the O
stock O
market O
, O
or O
the O
government O
's O
complex O
regulations O
and O
policies O
. O

So O
I O
intend O
to O
first O
answer O
their O
most O
pressing O
concern O
. O

In O
regard O
to O
China O
's O
domestic O
real O
estate O
prices O
, O
I O
sum O
it O
up O
in O
one O
sentence O
: O
" O
When O
oil O
prices O
are O
deregulated O
, O
house O
prices O
will O
plummet O
. O
" O

In O
the O
last O
three O
years O
, O
I O
have O
always O
thought O
that O
only O
when O
the O
RMB O
gains O
value O
against O
a O
basket O
of O
currencies O
will O
house O
prices O
start O
to O
fall O
. O

Any O
policies O
apart O
from O
this O
only O
serve O
to O
allow O
the O
government O
to O
boost O
tax O
revenue O
, O
or O
allow O
the O
state O

owned O
Commercial O
Bank O
to O
increase O
interest O

Some O
have O
said O
that O

well O
past O

And O
becoming O

dumbfounded O

In O
my O
opposition O

As O
for O

I O
do O

or O

to O

A O
friend O
inside O

told O

: O
I O
disagree O
with O
your O
political O
opinion O
, O
but O
we O
know O
you O
are O
different O
from O
some O
people O
, O
in O
that O
you O
are O
not O
for O
yourself O
, O
but O
rather O
genuinely O
for O
the O
good O
of O
the O
country O
-LRB- O
rough O
meaning O
-RRB- O
. O

I O
'm O
pretty O
moved O
and O
gratified O
over O
such O
words O
. O

It O
is O
commendable O
that O
such O
an O
understanding O
is O
from O
the O
camp O
I O
'm O
opposed O
to O
. O

It O
is O
far O
more O
normal O
and O
honest O
than O
some O
" O
fellows O
" O
in O
the O
democracy O
and O
" O
Confucian O
" O
factions O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
it O
is O
not O
that O
profound O
, O
because O
" O
for O
the O
good O
of O
the O
country O
" O
is O
just O
for O
my O
own O
good O
. O

Ancient O
scholars O
were O
for O
themselves O
, O
and O
Confucianism O
is O
a O
learning O
for O
one O
's O
own O
good O
. O

The O
work O
of O
developing O
inner O
morality O
and O
applying O
moral O
virtue O
to O
everything O
else O
must O
be O
furthered O
and O
completed O
by O
using O
various O
political O
, O
social O
, O
scientific O
practices O
. O

For O
Chinese O
Confucianists O
, O
in O
the O
current O
historic O
stage O
, O
it O
's O
the O
best O
practice O
of O
benevolent O
ruling O
to O
oppose O
privileges O
and O
pursue O
human O
rights O
and O
to O
oppose O
despotism O
and O
pursue O
democracy O

They O
completely O
stopped O
doing O
chimney O
construction O
, O
and O
the O
next O
chimney O
projects O
that O
were O
taken O
were O
directly O
contracted O
out O
, O
while O
still O
publicly O
claiming O
that O
it O
was O
their O
own O
team O
, O
thus O
messing O
around O
for O
a O
few O
more O
years O
. O

Later O
on O
, O
chimney O
construction O
was O
completely O
dropped O
. O

And O
then O
, O
the O
company O
delved O
into O
the O
labor O
market O
and O
promoted O
project O
management O
with O
regard O
to O
construction O
. O

The O
project O
department O
was O
only O
in O
charge O
of O
using O
people O
, O
and O
they O
did O
n't O
keep O
loafers O
even O
for O
a O
day O
. O

Loafers O
were O
directly O
handed O
over O
to O
the O
Labor O
Center O
. O

They O
gave O
200 O
yuan O
a O
month O
for O
living O
expenses O
, O
which O
basically O
means O
they O
were O
laid O
off O
. O

Because O
the O
company O
has O
n't O
recruited O
young O
employees O
for O
more O
than O
ten O
years O
, O
most O
of O
these O
people O
were O
what O
was O
called O
" O
personnel O
in O
their O
40s O
and O
50s O
" O
in O
society O
, O
a O
small O
handful O
of O
them O
were O
engineers O
and O
technicians O
, O
including O
some O
young O
university O
graduates O
. O

They O
should O
be O
reasonably O
considered O
unemployed O
people O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
the O
government O
's O
statistics O
of O
unemployed O
people O
include O
these O
people O
or O
not O
. O

Nowadays O
, O
all O
employees O
are O
completely O
replaced O
by O
contracted O
teams O
. O

Because O
there O
is O
no O
reference O
of O
the O
income O
of O
the O
previous O
construction O
workers O
, O
the O
migrant O
workers O
' O
wages O
are O
constantly O
increasing O
. O

The O
profits O
brought O
to O
companies O
from O
decreasing O
labor O
costs O
are O
also O
decreasing O
due O
to O
the O
government O
's O
measures O
for O
protecting O
migrant O
workers O
in O
recent O
years O
. O

Because O
migrant O
worker O
turnover O
is O
very O
fast O
and O
they O
frequently O
change O
companies O
or O
construction O
sites O
, O
they O
often O
work O
among O
several O
construction O
sites O
, O
which O
brings O
difficulties O
to O
company O
quality O
and O
safety O
management O
. O

This O
causes O
project O
quality O
to O
be O
unstable O
and O
increases O
potential O
safety O
hazards O
. O

Actually O
, O
in O
the O
years O
since O
the O
reforms O
, O
out O
of O
the O
numerous O
party O
members O
and O
ordinary O
cadres O
who O
worked O
to O
combat O
previous O
disasters O
, O
the O
majority O
through O
selfless O
dedication O
and O
practical O
action O
demonstrated O
that O
they O
were O
worthy O
members O
of O
the O
working O
class O
vanguard O
! O
Demonstrating O
that O
it O
was O
they O
who O
were O
the O
real O
nucleus O
, O
the O
backbone O
force O
and O
the O
hope O
of O
the O
Chinese O
Communist O
Party O
. O

Even O
those O
who O
went O
down O
the O
road O
of O
capitalist O
reform O
in O
the O
name O
of O
the O
party O
, O
they O
often O
ran O
the O
gauntlet O
of O
insults O
, O
sharing O
the O
" O
agony O
" O
of O
unemployment O
with O
countless O
other O
workers O
and O
the O
masses O
. O

It O
's O
difficult O
to O
imagine O
that O
without O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
party O
members O
and O
ordinary O
cadres O
who O
shared O
the O
good O
and O
bad O
times O
with O
the O
people O
, O
shared O
their O
trials O
and O
tribulations O
, O
together O
bearing O
the O
weight O
of O
the O
" O
three O
big O
mountains O
" O
brought O
about O
by O
the O
capitalist O
reforms O
, O
whether O
these O
disastrous O
reforms O
could O
have O
lasted O
all O
the O
way O
to O
the O
present O
! O
That O
the O
leadership O
authority O
of O
the O
party O
and O
nation O
, O
stolen O
by O
the O
capitalist O
roaders O
, O
the O
capitalist O
reformers O
and O
the O
revisionist O
groups O
could O
last O
until O
today O
! O

The O
entire O
party O
, O
entire O
army O
, O
and O
the O
whole O
country O
, O
especially O
the O
people O
in O
the O
disaster O
zone O
have O
not O
yet O
fully O
lost O
confidence O
in O
the O
Chinese O
Communist O
Party O
, O
even O
fervently O
hoping O
the O
party O
can O
crack O
down O
on O
corruption O
, O
and O
reestablish O
its O
former O
glorious O
and O
correct O
greatness O
! O

And O
therefore O
, O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
party O
members O
and O
ordinary O
cadres O
who O
genuinely O
and O
sincerely O
care O
about O
the O
people O
in O
the O
disaster O
zone O
, O
will O
, O
just O
as O
in O
the O
past O
, O
support O
the O
rebuilding O
of O
the O
disaster O
area O
, O
even O
to O
the O
extent O
of O
sacrificing O
everything O
at O
the O
moment O
of O
truth O
, O
including O
their O
lives O
. O

The O
Tangshan O
Earthquake O
left O
behind O
over O
4000 O
orphans O
. O

In O
the O
Wenchuan O
Earthquake O
, O
the O
first O
things O
to O
collapse O
in O
practically O
every O
town O
were O
the O
school O
buildings O
, O
while O
the O
government O
buildings O
next O
door O
were O
far O
sturdier O
. O

The O
bodies O
of O
the O
students O
killed O
in O
the O
earthquake O
came O
to O
rest O
in O
the O
school O
playgrounds O
, O
the O
unremitting O
wretched O
cries O
of O
many O
family O
members O
confirming O
the O

During O
the O
course O
of O
the O
relief O
effort O
, O
various O
media O
either O
consciously O
or O
unconsciously O
began O
ranking O
contributions O
to O
the O
relief O
effort O
. O

On O
one O
hand O
, O
this O
had O
the O
effect O
of O
earning O
community O
respect O
for O
some O
altruistic O
big O
players O
while O
carrying O
out O
their O
obligations O
to O
society O
, O
while O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
left O
others O
in O
very O
awkward O
territory O
, O
with O
on O
- O
the O
- O
spot O
grillings O
about O
community O
responsibility O
leading O
to O
some O
public O
figures O
lamenting O
that O
" O
charity O
must O
not O
become O
a O
burden O
" O
, O
and O
what O
sort O
of O
community O
culture O
does O
all O
this O
reflect O
? O

Whether O
or O
not O
there O
really O
are O
any O
warning O
signs O
for O
such O
a O
large O
quake O
, O
this O
" O
global O
dilemma O
" O
, O
only O
God O
knows O
. O

Public O
crises O
from O
floods O
, O
SARS O
, O
snowstorms O
to O
earthquakes O
at O
another O
level O
are O
testing O
the O
response O
and O
resilience O
of O
our O
societal O
mechanisms O
, O
which O
encompasses O
the O
ability O
to O
handle O
a O
crisis O
from O
top O
to O
bottom O
at O
a O
decision O
- O
making O
level O
and O
the O
ability O
to O
promptly O
and O
effectively O
deploy O
society O
resources O
, O
also O
taking O
in O
the O
initiative O
and O
teamwork O
skills O
of O
the O
community O
at O
large O
, O
from O
the O
lowest O
rung O
to O
the O
highest O
. O

China O
is O
probably O
approaching O
the O
turning O
point O
at O
which O
overall O
inflation O
starts O
to O
decline O
. O

The O
shortage O
of O
pork O
has O
always O
been O
one O
of O
the O
main O
reasons O
for O
the O
overall O
inflation O
to O
skyrocket O
. O

However O
, O
in O
recent O
weeks O
, O
domestic O
food O
prices O
have O
been O
stable O
or O
declining O
, O
relieving O
the O
public O
concern O
over O
shortage O
of O
supplies O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
weekly O
survey O
by O
the O
Ministry O
of O
Commerce O
of O
China O
shows O
that O
as O
of O
February O
, O
the O
wholesale O
price O
of O
fresh O
pork O
had O
been O
steadily O
rising O
to O
nearly O
23 O
yuan O
per O
kilogram O
-LRB- O
equivalent O
to O
3.29 O
U.S. O
dollars O
-RRB- O
. O

Since O
then O
, O
the O
price O
has O
basically O
stabilized O
, O
falling O
back O
at O
22.21 O
yuan O
last O
week O
. O

Even O
if O
the O
prices O
of O
products O
like O
pork O
do O
not O
drop O
, O
the O
inflation O
rate O
may O
also O
decline O
. O

Since O
China O
's O
CPI O
altogether O
broke O
through O
5 O
% O
in O
July O
of O
last O
year O
, O
the O
base O
of O
comparison O
for O
last O
year O
's O
prices O
will O
be O
significantly O
raised O
, O
starting O
from O
July O
this O
year O
. O

If O
no O
accelerated O
increase O
in O
prices O
has O
occurred O
by O
that O
time O
, O
then O
as O
time O
goes O
on O
, O
the O
year O
- O
on O
- O
year O
increase O
rate O
of O
prices O
will O
decline O
. O

The O
soaring O
food O
prices O
have O
indeed O
caused O
a O
lot O
of O
burden O
on O
impoverished O
people O
, O
but O
so O
far O
the O
overall O
consumption O
expenditure O
in O
China O
does O
not O
seem O
to O
have O
been O
affected O
by O
inflation O
. O

Good O
products O
sell O
well O
at O
high O
prices O
throughout O
the O
world O
. O

Most O
people O
accept O
this O
concept O
. O

It O
would O
n't O
be O
bad O
if O
the O
price O
of O
goods O
in O
China O
could O
be O
equal O
to O
that O
of O
the O
countries O
in O
the O
first O
world O
. O

If O
all O
the O
high O
- O
quality O
products O
did O
n't O
sell O
well O
at O
high O
prices O
in O
China O
and O
were O
sold O
cheaply O
everywhere O
, O
sellers O
would O
probably O
suffer O
great O
losses O
. O

People O
who O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
sell O
their O
good O
things O
at O
high O
price O
are O
fools O
. O

Who O
does O
n't O
want O
to O
save O
their O
own O
resources O
to O
buy O
good O
things O
at O
low O
prices O
? O

Is O
it O
worth O
it O
to O
use O
low O
prices O
to O
dominate O
the O
market O
? O

People O
used O
to O
do O
business O
by O
selling O
their O
surplus O
products O
, O
but O
what O
surplus O
products O
do O
we O
ourselves O
have O
? O

Whether O
or O
not O
this O
main O
direction O
is O
right O
or O
wrong O
can O
not O
be O
explained O
. O

Our O
main O
direction O
is O
exchanging O
a O
large O
quantity O
of O
cheap O
products O
for O
a O
large O
amount O
of O
foreign O
currency O
. O

From O
an O
economic O
perspective O
, O
many O
foreigners O
are O
also O
making O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
from O
Chinese O
people O
. O

Whether O
it O
is O
a O
surplus O
or O
deficit O
is O
not O
something O
that O
ordinary O
people O
are O
clear O
about O
. O

From O
the O
perspective O
of O
mutual O
exchange O
of O
needed O
products O
, O
there O
needs O
to O
be O
normal O
international O
trades O
after O
all O
. O

As O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
this O
boundary O
has O
already O
been O
crossed O
a O
long O
time O
go O
. O

Products O
that O
are O
in O
short O
supply O
in O
this O
country O
are O
exported O
in O
large O
quantity O
, O
and O
products O
this O
country O
has O
are O
still O
imported O
in O
large O
quantity O
. O

This O
has O
already O
gone O
against O
the O
principles O
of O
Chinese O
lifestyle O
. O

In O
the O
wake O
of O
the O
earthquake O
in O
Wenchuan O
, O
Sichuan O
, O
companies O
have O
followed O
up O
the O
actual O
situation O
with O
substantial O
donations O
, O
while O
conducting O
rational O
integrated O
event O
marketing O
. O

Tencent O
has O
demonstrated O
=great O
strength O
in O
this O
event O
, O
as O
not O
only O
has O
the O
company O
donated O
RMB O
10 O
million O
, O
but O
Tencent O
users O
have O
donated O
over O
10 O
million O
in O
disaster O
- O
relief O
funds O
. O

In O
the O
wee O
hours O
of O
May O
13 O
, O
Ma O
Huateng O
even O
personally O
supervised O
R O
& O

of O
QQ O
prayer O
version O
that O
Tencent O
made O
for O
people O
in O
the O
disaster O
- O
hit O
areas O
. O

Well O
then O
, O
how O
did O
Tencent O
properly O
covered O
these O
incidents O
? O

First O
, O
Tencent O
integrated O
the O
willingness O
of O
consumers O
, O
which O
is O
the O
willingness O
of O
Tencent O
users O
to O
donate O
for O
disaster O
- O
hit O
areas O
, O
and O
launched O
donation O
platforms O
on O
Tenpay O
, O
QQ O
prayer O
version O
and O
Tencent O
public O
charity O
website O
. O

It O
proves O
that O
Tencent O
's O
grasp O
of O
its O
users O
has O
been O
very O
accurate O
, O
Tencent O
's O
wisdom O
! O

The O
wisdom O
and O
social O
responsibility O
of O
users O
reflected O
the O
social O
responsibility O
of O
Tencent O
as O
a O
dot O
- O
com O
company O
. O

The O
amount O
for O
disaster O
relief O
donated O
by O
Tencent O
users O
has O
topped O
10 O
million O
. O

Integrated O
marketing O
is O
about O
integrating O
the O
willingness O
of O
consumers O
, O
which O
Tencent O
did O
in O
a O
very O
quick O
and O
comprehensive O
way O
. O

With O
more O
and O
more O
people O
willing O
to O
try O
the O
linux O
system O
, O
these O
habits O
may O
enable O
you O
to O
get O
twice O
the O
result O
with O
half O
the O
effort O
and O
find O
the O
fun O
in O
it O
. O

When O
you O
first O
begin O
to O
use O
Linux O
, O
you O
may O
feel O
unaccustomed O
to O
it O
. O

Many O
masters O
also O
share O
the O
same O
experience O
. O

They O
were O
once O
newbies O
after O
all O
. O

However O
, O
the O
Linux O
community O
is O
already O
doing O
an O
outstanding O
job O
in O
providing O
new O
users O
with O
relevant O
guides O
, O
manuals O
and O
basic O
technical O
documents O
, O
so O
that O
they O
can O
get O
started O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
. O

When O
I O
first O
got O
my O
hands O
on O
Linux O
three O
years O
ago O
, O
many O
people O
have O
helped O
me O
through O
forums O
, O
online O
chat O
and O
email O
. O

These O
" O
penguins O
" O
were O
really O
warm O
- O
hearted O
indeed O
. O

For O
this O
, O
I O
feel O
much O
obliged O
to O
do O
something O
within O
my O
capacity O
for O
the O
community O
that O
have O
helped O
me O
selflessly O
and O
write O
something O
for O
friends O
who O
have O
just O
begun O
to O
use O
Linux O
. O

Here O
I O
've O
compiled O
and O
translated O
seven O
habits O
others O
told O
me O
when O
I O
was O
a O
beginner O
. O

I O
believe O
if O
you O
apply O
the O
seven O
habits O
, O
you O
will O
feel O
it O
more O
secure O
and O
convenient O
and O
learn O
a O
lot O
of O
useful O
things O
when O
using O
Linux O
. O

Ultimately O
you O
will O
find O
using O
Linux O
is O
also O
as O
enjoyable O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
the O
Olympic O
torch O
is O
able O
to O
arrive O
China O
safely O
, O
the O
significant O
role O
of O
the O
overseas O
Chinese O
is O
undeniable O
. O

There O
was O
a O
time O
when O
some O
people O
had O
always O
harbored O
a O
hostile O
mentality O
towards O
overseas O
Chinese O
. O

Even O
if O
they O
returned O
to O
serve O
the O
country O
and O
even O
if O
news O
articles O
called O
them O
" O
returnees O
, O
" O
what O
was O
actually O
in O
people O
's O
mind O
were O
names O
like O
" O
sea O
turtles O
" O
or O
" O
sea O
weeds O
. O
" O

Anyway O
, O
none O
of O
the O
names O
treated O
those O
students O
who O
had O
returned O
or O
wanted O
to O
return O
with O
due O
respect O
. O

A O
friend O
of O
mine O
once O
made O
a O
call O
to O
ask O
about O
how O
things O
were O
going O
at O
the O
research O
institute O
where O
he O
ever O
worked O
. O

The O
director O
immediately O
responded O
, O
" O
Do O
n't O
come O
back O
if O
you O
are O
doing O
well O
in O
the O
United O
States O
! O
" O

I O
reckon O
he O
was O
afraid O
he O
might O
lose O
his O
job O
to O
a O
returnee O
. O

The O
Great O
Olympic O
Torch O
Relay O
has O
not O
only O
demonstrated O
the O
capabilities O
of O
overseas O
Chinese O
, O
but O
more O
importantly O
has O
showcased O
their O
patriotism O
as O
clear O
as O
the O
sun O
in O
the O
sky O
, O
which O
dwarfs O
those O
bad O
nationals O
who O
are O
unaccomplished O
, O
ill O
- O
intentioned O
or O
even O
corrupt O
and O
allows O
the O
Chinese O
government O
to O
see O
overseas O
Chinese O
in O
a O
better O
light O
. O

This O
will O
certainly O
be O
inspirational O
and O
helpful O
to O
the O
Chinese O
government O
, O
among O
other O
things O
, O
in O
its O
future O
policy O
- O
making O
concerning O
cadres O
, O
talents O
and O
returnees O
, O
as O
well O
as O
adjusting O
its O
rigid O
citizenship O
rules O
. O

I O
am O
in O
Taipei O
, O
and O
other O
than O
donating O
a O
small O
amount O
of O
money O
to O
Tzu O
Chi O
to O
support O
my O
fellow O
countrymen O
, O
I O
really O
could O
n't O
do O
a O
whole O
lot O
. O

I O
could O
only O
say O
: O
Go O
fellow O
countrymen O
in O
Sichuan O
!! O
Go O
Chinese O
people O
on O
both O
sides O
of O
the O
Strait O
!! O

Let O
me O
share O
something O
I O
've O
learned O
with O
my O
friends O
and O
countrymen O
in O
the O
mainland O
, O
especially O
those O
in O
Sichuan O
. O

Those O
who O
have O
survived O
the O
great O
earthquake O
that O
had O
resulted O
in O
enormous O
casualties O
, O
other O
than O
being O
careful O
with O
the O
deadly O
epidemic O
and O
viruses O
, O
most O
importantly O
, O
must O
pay O
attention O
to O
the O
survivors O
who O
are O
suffering O
depression O
triggered O
by O
the O
unbearable O
deaths O
of O
their O
family O
members O
and O
close O
friends O
near O
them O
, O
so O
as O
to O
prevent O
a O
wave O
of O
suicide O
. O

I O
'm O
stressing O
once O
again O
, O
every O
effort O
must O
be O
made O
to O
cheer O
up O
and O
encourage O
the O
people O
who O
survived O
the O
disaster O
so O
as O
to O
prevent O
a O
wave O
of O
suicide O
. O

This O
is O
very O
terrible O
and O
should O
n't O
be O
taken O
lightly O
. O

Waves O
of O
suicide O
occurred O
after O
the O
great O
Hanshin O
earthquake O
in O
Japan O
or O
after O
the O
9 O
/ O
21 O
earthquake O
in O
Taiwan O
. O

Especially O
with O
regard O
to O
=Hanshin O
, O
many O
of O
the O
survivors O
committed O
suicide O
one O
after O
another O
during O
the O
period O
of O
six O
months O
to O
one O
year O
after O
the O
earthquake O
. O

So O
in O
the O
case O
of O
the O
9 O
/ O
21 O
earthquake O
back O
then O
, O
Tzu O
Chi O
, O
based O
on O
the O
experience O
from O
the O
Hanshin O
earthquake O
disaster O
, O
laid O
special O
emphasis O
on O
encouraging O
the O
survivors O
in O
the O
disaster O
area O
of O
Nantou O
in O
Taiwan O
and O
let O
them O
cry O
out O
loud O
whenever O
they O
felt O
sad O
. O

By O
allowing O
them O
to O
pour O
out O
their O
excruciating O
sorrow O
over O
the O
dead O
, O
they O
tried O
to O
keep O
them O
from O
contemplating O
suicide O
. O

Marx O
affirmed O
Feuerbach O
's O
materialism O
in O
the O
field O
of O
nature O
, O
but O
criticized O
his O
idealism O
in O
the O
field O
of O
social O
history O
. O

Basically O
, O
facing O
the O
ugly O
reality O
of O
capitalism O
, O
he O
sank O
into O
idealism O
in O
terms O
of O
how O
to O
solve O
social O
problems O
, O
believing O
" O
universal O
love O
" O
was O
capable O
of O
treating O
social O
wounds O
. O

This O
is O
similar O
to O
the O
refrain O
, O
" O
if O
everyone O
gives O
a O
little O
love O
, O
the O
world O
will O
become O
a O
beautiful O
society O
, O
" O
sung O
in O
popular O
songs O
today O
. O

On O
the O
basis O
of O
his O
critique O
of O
Feuerbach O
, O
Marx O
established O
the O
scientific O
socialism O
of O
historical O
materialism O
and O
found O
" O
the O
path O
of O
proletarian O
revolution O
and O
the O
dictatorship O
of O
the O
proletariat O
" O
to O
transform O
capitalist O
society O
. O

But O
various O
representatives O
of O
the O
bourgeois O
humanitarian O
thought O
always O
wanted O
to O
replace O
revolution O
with O
humanitarianism O
and O
even O
distorted O
the O
core O
value O
of O
Marxist O
communism O
into O
humanitarianism O
. O

Marx O
gave O
a O
merciless O
refutation O
of O
this O
. O

He O
said O
, O
if O
the O
humanitarianism O
of O
early O
capitalism O
still O
had O
somewhat O
progressive O
significance O
to O
feudalism O
, O
then O
after O
we O
have O
already O
blazed O
a O
path O
and O
found O
the O
approach O
of O
scientific O
socialism O
, O
to O
still O
preach O
the O
bourgeoisie O
's O
humanitarianism O
would O
mean O
that O
he O
was O
either O
new O
to O
the O
revolution O
, O
or O
he O
was O
the O
fiercest O
enemy O
of O
the O
revolution O
. O
