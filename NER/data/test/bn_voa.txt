The O

the O

the O
lifting O

led O

This O
was O
made O

Energy B-ORG

I O

Some O
other O

are O
not O
convinced O
that O
a O

will O
solve O
the O
problem O

oppose O
a O

instead O
they O

that O

the O
principle O

national O
sovereignty O

not O

We O
are O
usually O
not O
sufficiently O
clear O
, O
we O
meaning O
the O
Secretariat B-ORG
, O
in O
explaining O
that O
sovereignty O
and O
final O
analysis O
belongs O
to O
the O
people O
and O
sovereignty O
should O
be O
seen O
in O
a O
democratic O
context O
. O

Sovereignty O
is O
not O
simply O
a O
quality O
of O
statehood O
, O
but O
it O
has O
to O
do O
with O
the O
power O
of O
the O
people O

democratic O
structures O
which O
make O
sovereignty O
an O
important O
human O

Mr. O

that O
a O
lack O

The O

News B-ORG
Now I-ORG
's I-ORG
Susan B-PERSON
Yakie I-PERSON
spoke O
with O
our O
New B-GPE
Delhi I-GPE
correspondent O
Jim B-PERSON
Teeple I-PERSON
about O
the O
Russian B-NORP
leader O
's O
visit O
and O
his O
comments O
about O
the O
situation O
in O
the O
disputed O
Kashmir B-GPE
region O
. O

He O
said O
exactly O
what O
the O
Indians B-NORP
wanted O
to O
hear O
, O
which O
is O
that O
the O
dispute O
over O
Kashmir B-GPE
between O
India B-GPE
and O
Pakistan B-GPE
should O
be O
solved O
bilaterally O
and O
that O
there O
should O
be O
no O
outside O
interference O
, O
as O
he O
put O
it O
in O
this O
question O
. O

Now O
this O
is O
something O
the O
Indians O
have O
been O
saying O
all O
along O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
Pakistan B-GPE
wants O
international O
attention O
focussed O
on O
Kashmir B-GPE
, O
and O
Mr. O
Putin B-PERSON
also O
said O
that O
he O
supports O
India B-GPE
's O
tough O
approach O
to O
the O
external O
violence O
in O
Kashmir B-GPE
as O
he O
described O
it O
. O

This O
is O
another O
thing O
that O
the O
Indians B-NORP
were O
glad O
to O
hear O
him O
say O
, O
and O
he O
also O
said O
that O
both O
India B-GPE
and O
Russia B-GPE
suffer O
from O
the O
same O
sort O
of O
terrorism O
, O
as O
he O
put O
it O
, O
referring O
of O
course O
to O
the O
separatist O
militancies O
in O
Chechnya B-GPE
and O
Russia B-GPE
and O
in O
Jammu B-GPE
and O
Kashmir B-GPE
. O

So O
on O
balance O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
the O
Indians B-NORP
heard O
anything O
from O
Mr. O
Putin B-PERSON
that O
they O
did O
not O
want O
to O
hear O
. O

What O
sort O
of O
hold O
does O
Russia B-GPE
have O
on O
India B-GPE
and O
Pakistan B-GPE
? O

Russia B-GPE
has O
very O
little O
influence O
with O
Pakistan B-GPE
, O
but O
of O
course O
Russia B-GPE
supplies O
India B-GPE
with O
70 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
its O
military O
hardware O
and O
that O
was O
of O
course O
the O
second O
pillar O
here O
of O
Mr. O
Putin B-PERSON
's O
visit O
, O
which O
was O
to O
finalize O
some O
very O
substantial O
arms O
deals O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
we O
're O
hearing O
that O
those O
deals O
have O
now O
been O
finalized O
, O
that O
Russia B-GPE
will O
sell O
India B-GPE
300 B-CARDINAL
tanks O
, O
T B-PRODUCT
- I-PRODUCT
90 I-PRODUCT
tanks O
, O
very O
advanced O
tanks O
, O
that O
Russia B-GPE
will O
also O
sell O
to O
India B-GPE
some O
Sukoi B-PRODUCT
- I-PRODUCT
30 I-PRODUCT
bombers O
, O
fighter O
- O
bombers O
. O

They O
are O
going O
to O
allow O
India B-GPE
to O
assemble O
about B-CARDINAL
140 I-CARDINAL
of O
these O
bombers O
here O
in O
India B-GPE
, O
and O
they O
are O
also O
going O
to O
finalize O
a O
deal O
whereby O
India B-GPE
will O
acquire O
the O
Admiral O
Gorshkov B-PERSON
. O

That O
's O
an O
old O
Russian B-NORP
aircraft O
carrier O
that O
India B-GPE
has O
wanted O
to O
get O
for O
some O
time O
because O
India B-GPE
only O
has O
one O
other O
aircraft O
carrier O
, O
and O
this O
carrier O
in O
particular O
would O
allow O
the B-ORG
Indian I-ORG
Navy I-ORG
to O
extend O
its O
strategic O
strength O
much O
farther O
than O
it O
currently O
can O
now O
. O

So O
indeed O
Russia B-GPE
does O
have O
quite O
a O
bit O
of O
influence O
here O
. O

These O
ties O
have O
gone O
way O
back O
, O
nearly B-DATE
40 I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
and O
they O
were O
strengthened O
considerably O
by O
this O
visit O
. O

In O
fact O
both O
countries O
have O
now O
agreed O
to O
combat O
what O
they O
call O
terrorism O
with O
joint O
groups O
. O

They O
have O
also O
set O
up O
a O
joint O
working O
group O
on O
Afghanistan B-GPE
, O
which O
is O
of O
course O
a O
cause O
of O
concern O
for O
both O
countries O
. O

Mr. O
Putin B-PERSON
's O
visit O
is O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
by O
a O
Russian B-NORP
leader O
in O
seven B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

Why O
does O
the O
trip O
come O
now O
? O

Well O
, O
his O
trip O
has O
actually O
been O
delayed O
for O
a B-DATE
couple I-DATE
of I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

Russian B-NORP
President O
was O
supposed O
to O
visit O
India B-GPE
as O
early O
as O
97 B-DATE
- O
1998 B-DATE
, O
but O
of O
course O
Boris B-PERSON
Yeltsin I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
health O
problems O
got O
in O
the O
way O
of O
that O
, O
and O
then O
of O
course O
, O
Mr. O
Yeltsin B-PERSON
's O
abrupt O
resignation O
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
another O
visit O
and O
then O
the O
subsequent O
election O
campaign O
and O
inauguration O
of O
Vladimir B-PERSON
Putin I-PERSON
took O
some O
time O
, O
so O
it O
's O
been O
put O
off O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
. O

But O
there O
have O
also O
been O
a O
lot O
of O
delays O
in O
other O
areas O
. O

These O
arms O
agreements O
that O
we O
were O
just O
speaking O
about O
have O
taken O
quite O
some O
time O
to O
finalize O
. O

How O
does O
this O
visit O
by O
Mr. O
Putin B-PERSON
compare O
to O
President O
Clinton B-PERSON
's O
visit O
earlier B-DATE
this I-DATE
year I-DATE
? O

That O
's O
an O
interesting O
question O
because O
Vladimir B-PERSON
Putin I-PERSON
on O
Wednesday B-DATE
addressed O
the B-ORG
Indian I-ORG
Parliament I-ORG
just O
as O
Bill B-PERSON
Clinton I-PERSON
had O
done O
six B-DATE
months I-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
and O
I O
think O
it O
's O
safe O
to O
say O
that O
Mr. O
Putin B-PERSON
actually O
probably O
accomplished O
more O
than O
Mr. O
Clinton B-PERSON
did O
in O
the O
hard O
concrete O
terms O
of O
arms O
sales O
and O
that O
sort O
of O
thing O
, O
but O
it O
was O
Mr. O
Clinton B-PERSON
that O
stole O
the O
Indian B-NORP
lawmakers O
' O
hearts O
. O

Of O
course O
you O
will O
recall O
when O
he O
spoke O
to O
the O
parliament O
there O
was O
an O
ecstatic O
welcome O
for O
him O
. O

The O
Indian B-NORP
lawmakers O
were O
sort O
of O
clambering O
over O
each O
other O
to O
shake O
his O
hand O
as O
he O
left O
the O
parliament O
building O
. O

There O
was O
none O
of O
that O
for O
Mr. O
Putin B-PERSON
, O
but O
he O
did O
receive O
a O
very O
warm O
welcome O
, O
although O
most O
ordinary O
Indians B-NORP
who O
were O
actually O
rather O
captivated O
by O
Mr. O
Clinton B-PERSON
's O
visit O
did O
not O
really O
pay O
much O
attention O
to O
Mr. O
Putin B-PERSON
's O
visit O
. O

In O
fact O
his O
visit O
has O
somewhat O
been O
ignored O
and O
in O
fact O
the O
main O
news O
story O
here O
in O
India B-GPE
has O
been O
sort O
of O
a O
local O
controversy O
over O
the O
roll O
- O
back O
of O
fuel O
prices O
rather O
than O
Mr. O
Putin B-PERSON
's O
visit O
, O
but O
he O
did O
do O
what O
he O
had O
to O
do O
and O
he O
certainly O
strengthened O
ties O
in O
a O
strategic O
sense O

that O

officials O
who O

leading O
the O

with O
Yemen B-GPE
's O
help O
. O

The O
US B-ORG
Navy I-ORG
destroyer O
damaged O
apparently O
by O
a O
terrorist O
bomb O
while O
refueling O
at O
the O
Red B-LOC
Sea I-LOC
port O

Aden B-GPE

As O
Dave B-PERSON
Gavlak I-PERSON
reports O
, O
the B-PRODUCT
US I-PRODUCT
Cole I-PRODUCT
was O
towed O
out O
of O
the B-FAC
Aden I-FAC
Harbor I-FAC
to O
a O
waiting O
Norwegian B-NORP
transport O
ship O
, O
that O
will O
actually O
carry O
the O
damaged O
destroyer O
home O
. O

The O
American B-NORP
national O
anthem O
played O
as O
four B-CARDINAL
tug O
boats O
pulled O
the B-PRODUCT
USS I-PRODUCT
Cole I-PRODUCT
slowly O
out O
of O
Yemen B-GPE
's O
southern O
port O
of O
Aden B-GPE
. O

The O
Cole B-PRODUCT

badly O

two B-DATE

in O
an O
apparent O
suicide O

17 B-CARDINAL

patrol O
boats O
mounted O

Some O
Yemenis B-NORP
expressed O
relief O

see O
the O

Many O

said O
they O
feared O
the O

would O
serve O
as O
an O
excuse O
for O
continued O
US B-GPE
military O
presence O

the O
Gulf B-LOC
country O
. O

Diplomats O
and O

have O
commented O
that O
a O
joint O
investigation O

in O

strengthen O

super O

the O
poor O
, O
but O
strategic O
Arab B-NORP
state O
. O

US B-GPE
and O
Yemeni B-NORP
officials O
say O
they O
believe O
Islamic B-NORP
militants O
may O
have O
carried O
out O
the O
bombing O
. O

So O
far O
two B-CARDINAL
little O
known O
Islamic B-NORP
groups O
have O
claimed O
responsibility O
for O
the O
attack O

Yemeni B-NORP
authorities O
claimed O
they O
have O
detained O
over B-CARDINAL
70 I-CARDINAL
people O
for O
questioning O
. O

These O
include O
some O
Afghan B-NORP

Arab I-NORP
volunteers O
who O
came O
to O
Yemen B-GPE
after O
fighting O
