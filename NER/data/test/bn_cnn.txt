old I-DATE
and O
a O
man O
with O
a O

this O
one O
having O
a O
peaceful O

. O

This O
is O
near O
the B-FAC
Long I-FAC
Beach I-FAC
Airport I-FAC
and O
involved O
a O
city O
bus O
. O

A O
man O
who O
had O
assault O
, O
he O
actually O
had O
assault O
with O
a O
deadly O
weapon O
, O
this O
is O

Look O
at O
that O
. O

Man O
spread O
- O
eagle O
with O
a O
two B-DATE
- I-DATE
year I-DATE
- I-DATE
old I-DATE
child O
. O

The O
officer O
is O
going O
to O
go O
in O
and O
swoop O
her O
away O
. O

As O
we O
understand O
it O
, O
the O
man O
had O
the O
child O
. O

It O
was O
inside O
of O
the O
city O
bus O
. O

Police O
surrounded O
this O
bus O
near O
the O
airport O
with O
guns O
drawn O
. O

The O
man O
came O
out O
and O
did O
the O
spread O
- O
eagle O
like O
that O
. O

Just O
as O
he O
did O
that O
, O
that O
's O
when O
you O
saw O
the O
child O
just O
walking O
just B-QUANTITY
a I-QUANTITY
few I-QUANTITY
feet I-QUANTITY
away O
from O
him O
but O
the O
officers O
were O
able O
to O
get O
the O

away O
. O

They O
handcuffed O
the O
man O
and O
they O
took O
him O
into O

. O

That O
was O
after O
he O
had O
actually O
barricaded O
himself O
inside O
that O
bus O
with O
the O
child O
. O

So O
that O
one O
coming O
to O
a O
peaceful O
ending O
, O
what O
could O
have O
been O
a O
very O
gruesome O
situation O

80,000 B-CARDINAL

who O

what O
else O

It O

called O
Bonnaroo B-EVENT

Check O
it O
out O
. O

Bonnaroo B-EVENT
is O
kind O
of O
this O
going O
example O
of O
what O
the O
whole O
jam O
band O
community O
is O
turned O
in O
. O

That O
's O
what O
I O
really O
like O
about O
the O
jam O
community O
, O
its O
acceptance O
of O
improvizational O
music O
, O
despite O
whatever O
region O
or O
genre O
. O

It O
's O
about O
the O
freedom O
of O
the O
music O
and O
the O
freedom O
of O
expression O
. O

Well O
, O
we O
sold O
all O
80,000 B-CARDINAL
tickets O
through O
our O
web O
site O
. O

We O
sold O
out O
in O
16 B-DATE
days I-DATE
. O

I O
mean O
, O
the O
amazing O
thing O
is O
, O
we O
used O
no O
traditional O
advertising O
. O

We O
put O
all O
these O
bands O
together O
. O

It O
draws O
a O
huge O
audience O
, O
so O
the O
record O
companies O
and O
the O
music O
business O
has O
to O
take O
all O
of O
these O
forms O
of O
music O
more O
seriously O
. O

It O
's O
like O
strength O
in O
numbers O
. O

I O
hope O
this O
kind O
of O
thing O
can O
happen O
in O
America B-GPE
, O
instead O
of O
it O
just O
being O
these O
isolated O
festivals O
like O
Bonnaroo B-EVENT
, O
it O
really O
can O
happen O
in O
100 B-CARDINAL
cities O
every O
summer O
, O
like O
the O
festivals O
do O
in O
Europe B-LOC
. O

My O
only O
complaint O
is O
the O
overlapping O
. O

You O
know O
, O
as O
a O
music O
lover O
that O
I O
am O
, O
there O
's O
five B-CARDINAL
acts O
all O
playing O
at O
the O
same O
time O
on O
five B-CARDINAL
different O
stages O
that O
I O
want O
to O
see O
. O

It O
really O
comes O
from O
the O
actual O
bands O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
there O
's O
this O
grassroots O
following O
that O
's O
been O
there O
, O
you O
know O
, O
for O
a O
long O
time O

the O

Grateful I-ORG
Dead I-ORG
. O

We O
will O
get O
by O
we O
will O
survive O
. O

We O
're O
carrying O
on O
a O
tradition O
that O
started O
a O
long O
time O
. O

In O
American B-NORP
music O
, O
improvization O
is O
what O
it O
's O
always O
been O
about O
. O

It O
's O
not O
just O
clapping O
and O
having O
a O
good O
time O
. O

It O
makes O
you O
feel O
a O
certain O
kind O
of O
love O
, O
and O
hopefully O
, O
that O
translates O
in O
the O
community O
. O

You O
go O
out O
. O

You O
hug O
someone O
. O

You O
do O
something O
good O
. O

You O
make O
a O
better O

For O

in O
the O
first B-ORDINAL

or O
did O
n't O
leave O
earlier O
. O

She O
was O
quite O
a O
misfit O
for O
this O
administration O
, O
and O
she O
showed O
that O
over O
and O
over O
. O

She O
was O
not O
good O
at O
all O
at O
communicating O
the O
administration O
's O
message O
to O
the O
public O
and O
certainly O
to O
the O
environmental O
groups O
and O
she O
was O
even O
worse O
at O
bringing O
the O
EPA B-ORG
bureaucracy O
, O
the O
EPA B-ORG
environmental O
policy O
makers O
' O
message O
to O
this O
administration O
because O
she O
saw O
herself O
undercut O
over O
and O
over O
. O

That O
's O
interesting O
because O
leading O
into O
it O
, O
while O
she O
was O
New B-GPE
Jersey I-GPE
governor O
, O
she O
sued O
the O
EPA B-ORG
and O
she O
was O
very O
much O
considering O
herself O
to O
be O
an O
environmentalist O
, O
and O
then O
only O
to O
end O
up O
becoming O
the O
head O
of O
the O
EPA B-ORG
and O
then O
of O
course O
, O
there O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
criticism O
over O
relaxed O
regulations O
. O

Let O
's O
hear O
what O
she O
had O
to O
say O
last B-DATE
Wednesday I-DATE
here O
on O
CNN O
just O
after O
announcing O
her O
resignation O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
leaving O
because O
of O
clashes O
with O
the O
administration O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
I O
have O
n't O
had O
any O
. O

I O
report O
to O
the O
President O
, O
and O
he O
has O
always O
asked O
me O
to O
give O
him O
my O
best O
unadulterated O
advice O
. O

We O
have O
have O
been O
on O
the O
same O
page O
. O

I O
was O
never O
supportive O
of O
protocol O
because O
it O
did O
n't O
do O
what O
everyone O
needs O
to O
get O
done O
as O
far O
as O
climate O
change O
is O
concerned O
. O

I O
'm O
leaving O
now O
because O
it O
's O
the O
appropriate O
time O
to O
do O
it O
. O

Dan O
, O
do O
you O
agree O
with O
that O
? O

She O
says O
the O
appropriate O
time O
. O

Do O
you O
suppose O
for O
personal O
reasons O
or O
perhaps O
she O
was O
out O
of O
step O
with O
the O
administration O
? O

I O
'm O
sure O
that O
it O
was O
difficult O
for O
her O
personally O
, O
but O
I O
think O
the O
commuter O
marriage O
perhaps O
would O
have O
been O
less O
stressful O
if O
everyday O
she O
did O
n't O
see O
herself O
being O
undermined O
and O
overruled O
. O

I O
mean O
if O
Christy B-PERSON
Whitman I-PERSON
and O
the B-ORG
White I-ORG

were O
on O
the O

I O

I O

I O
was O

a O
position O
that O
my O
dear O

was O
in O
when O
he O
was O
killed O
outside O
Bagdad B-GPE

but O
I O
had O
long O
thought O

I O
was O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
in O
the O
previous O
war O
that O
really O
all O
the O

that O

been O
about O
the O
rush O
to O
war O
, O
the O
push O
for O
war O
, O
the O
drive O
for O
war O
, O
all O
that O
propaganda O
, O
was O
essentially O
nonsensical O
because O
in O
1990 B-DATE
, O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
made O
the O
only O
self O
criticism O
. O

He O
said O
, O
I O
could O
either O
invade O
Kuwait B-GPE
or O
finish O
developing O
the O
nuclear O
weapon O
. O

Maybe O
before O
the O
weapon O
and O
then O
later O
he O
said O
, O
Oh O
, O
I O
should O
have O
got O
the O
nuclear O
weapon O
before O
I O
invaded O
. O

He O
was O
right O
about O
that O
, O
but O
that O
means O
that O
he O
inaugurated O
at O
that O
point O
like O
a O
dozen B-DATE
- I-DATE
years I-DATE
war O
where O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE

could O
be O
criticized O
for O
doing O
too O
little O
and O
acting O
too O
slowly O
but O
all O
we O
're O
arguing O
about O
lately O
is O
to O
do O
with O
those O
that O
should O
have O
been O
finished O
in O
`91 B-DATE
when O
it O
could O
have O
been O
finished O

Should O
have O
taken O
the O
side O

, O
taken O
the O
risk O
of O
supporting O

helping O

removing O

be O
11 B-DATE

if O
we O
'd O
done O
that O
. O

That O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
core O
of O
the O
argument O
. O

As O
you O
point O
out O
, O
of O
course O
, O
for O
the O
fact O
of O
the O
matter O
is O
, O
the O
mistakes O
of O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
made O
possible O
his O
removal O
from O
power O
ultimately O
. O

The O
mistakes O
of O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
, O
again O
, O
as O
you O
point O
out O
, O
Norman B-PERSON
Schwarzkopf I-PERSON
making O
a O
peace O
, O
permitting O
helicopters O
to O
fly O
. O

Still O
hurts O
me O
to O
read O
this O
. O

The O
little O
town O
I O
was O
in O
this O
southern O
Iraq B-GPE
, O
as O
far O
as O
I O
got O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
boast O
of O
further O
, O
is O
where O
the O
talks O
took O
place O
. O

We O
have O
the O
transcript O
of O
the O
meeting O
. O

They O
say O
, O
Okay O
, O
we O
have O
lost O
this O
round O
, O
Do O
you O
mind O
if O
we O
keep O
your O
helicopters O
in O
the O
air O
just O
to O
be O
able O
to O
transport O
things O
? O
and O
he O
says O
, O
Yeah O
, O
that O
's O
all O
right O
. O

They O
ask O
again O
, O
Are O
you O
sure O
they O
mean O
that O
? O

They O
ca O
n't O
believe O
the O
luck O
. O

They O
use O
the O
gunships O
to O
kill O
, O
we O
think O
, O
not B-CARDINAL
less I-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
50,000 I-CARDINAL
inhabitants O
of O
southern O
Iraq B-GPE
and O
trying O
to O
do O
that O
to O
the O
Kurds B-NORP
, O
as O
well O
, O
so O
it O
was O
a O
knife O
edge O
. O

And O
it O
's O
not O
just O
being O
wise O
after O
the O
event O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
to O
say O
that O
there O
was O
an O
argument O
in O
realtime O
between O
the O
Bush B-PERSON
administration O
members O
. O

Mr. O
Cheney B-PERSON
's O
the O
only O
one O
I O
know O
that O
changed O
his O
mind O
. O

Most O
of O
those O
that O
took O
the O
view O
at O
that O
time O
, O
think O
until O
recently O
they O
were O
correct O
in O
saving O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
. O

Of O
course O
, O
Mr. O
Cheney B-PERSON
was O
in O
the O
chain O
of O
command O
with O
Swartzkopf B-PERSON
and O
-- O

Many O
others O
. O

When O
they O
made O
the O
decision O
not O
to O
move O
toward O
Bagdad B-GPE
with O
bad O
information O
, O
namely O
, O
the B-ORG
Republican I-ORG
Guard I-ORG
absolutely O
devastated O
. O

Yes O
. O

And O
, O
well O
, O
we O
know O
now O
the O
harvest O
of O
all O
that O
. O

It O
hurts O
to O
think O
of O
how O
many O
wonderful O
people O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
at O
the O
academic O
community O
, O
lawyers O
, O
human O
rights O
activists O
, O
civilians O
, O
intellectuals O
, O
people O
-- O
would O
now O
be O
alive O
, O
who O
have O
been O
horribly O
murdered O
and O
tortured O
and O
reduced O
to O
misery O
since O
by O
a O
half O
application O
of O
violence O
through O
sanctions O
and O
overflights O
. O

Mistakes O
made O
then O
, O
mistakes O
part O
of O
human O
experience O
, O
but O
now O
we O
have O
an O
opportunity O
not O
to O
make O
mistakes O
. O

Is O
it O
your O
sense O
that O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
is O
on O
the O
right O
track O
? O
that O
there O
is O
a O
commitment O
here O

the O

are O
now O
confident O
the O
mysterious O
trucks O
filled O

high O

found O

Iraq B-GPE
are O
indeed O
mobile O

just O

predicted O

It O
's O
very O
important O

recognize O
that O

we O

existed O

exist O

Reporter O

Though O
no O

I O

Reporter O

The O
CIA B-ORG

Pentagon B-ORG
reports O
admits O
the O
trucks O
were O
not O
an O
efficient O
way O

but O
officials O
argue O
the O
point O
for O
the O
Iraqis B-NORP
was O
to O
produce O
some O
and O
not O
to O
be O
caught O
doing O
it O

This O
was O
clearly O
a O
very O
inefficient O
way O
to O

why O
did O

announce O
, O
that O
this O
Iraqi B-NORP

First O
of O
all O
, O
Karl B-PERSON
, O
how O
many O
Iraqis B-NORP
were O
killed O
in O
that O
incident O
? O

Well O
, O
joining O

the O

William B-PERSON

MR. O
chairman O

it O
's O
good O
to O
have O
you O
here O
. O

Nice O
to O
be O
here O
, O
Lou B-PERSON
. O

Let O
's O
start O
with O
that O
surprise O
, O
the O
malfeasance O
that O
is O
crossing O
your O
desk O
. O

Are O
you O
suggesting O
corporate O
America B-GPE
has O
not O
learned O
its O
lesson O
yet O
? O

Well O
, O
no O
. O

I O
think O
that O
quote O
is O
a O
little O
out O
of O
context O
there O
. O

there O
are O
15,000 B-CARDINAL
companies O
in O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
, O
and O
I O
think O
the O
great O
bulk O
of O
them O
are O
very O
honestly O
managed O
and O
so O
forth O
. O

a O
number O
of O
people O
have O
had O
egregious O
fraud O
and O
so O
forth O
. O

There O
's O
been O
a O
general O
loosening O
of O
morals O
across O
the O
board O
. O

What O
I O
was O
referring O
to O
in O
that O
quote O
you O
had O
was O
the O
number O
of O
cases O
we O
see O
day O
in O
and O
day O
out O
at O
the O
lowest O
levels O
, O
scams O
and O
so O
forth O
, O
where O
considerable O
amounts O
of O
money O
are O
being O
made O
and O
lost O
by O
relatively O
small O
investors O
. O

Is O
the O
investor O
today B-DATE
in O
your O
judgment O
secure O
? O

Well O
, O
I O
think O
that O
the O
marketplace O
is O
becoming O
increasingly O
secure O
. O

I O
think O
a O
number O
of O
the O
reforms O
that O
have O
come O
via O
the B-LAW
Sarbanes I-LAW
- I-LAW
Oxley I-LAW
Act I-LAW
and O
a O
number O
of O
things O
that O
we O
have O
done O
at O
the O
SEC B-ORG
are O
basically O
making O
everybody O
take O
a O
new O
look O
at O
how O
they O
're O
performing O
their O
duty O
as O
a O
director O
, O
how O
they O
're O
performing O
their O
duties O
on O
audit O
committees O
and O
compensation O
committees O
and O
in O
Wall B-ORG
Street I-ORG
. O

I O
think O
the O
reforms O
that O
came O
as O
a O
part O
of O
the O
large O
settlement O
are O
going O
to O
change O
the O
way O
research O
and O
investment O
banking O
are O
done O
to O
the O
betterment O
of O
the O
individual O
investor O
. O

And O
some O
people O
are O
surprised O
and O
I O
might O
even O
add O
pleased O
in O
this O
city O
that O
your O
SEC B-ORG
has O
been O
quick O
to O
react O
when O
Phil B-PERSON
Purcell I-PERSON
of O
Morgan B-ORG
Stanley I-ORG
made O
a O
statement O
that O
your O
SEC B-ORG
did O
n't O
think O
and O
that O
you O
did O
n't O
think O
expressed O
appropriate O
contrition O
when O
Bear B-ORG
Stearns I-ORG
stepped O
out O
of O
line O
in O
the O
view O
of O
the O
SEC B-ORG
. O

It O
was O
n't O
a O
polite O
phone O
call O
quietly O
made O
, O
either O
from O
your O
enforcement O
division O
or O
from O
your O
office O
, O
it O
was O
rather O
public O
. O

Is O
that O
the O
way O
you O
're O
going O
to O
operate O
? O

Well O
, O
Lou B-PERSON
, O
we O
're O
deadly O
serious O
about O
bringing O
reform O
into O
the O
marketplace O
. O

We O
're O
deadly O
serious O
about O
some O
of O
the O
actions O
we O
've O
taken O
, O
and O
when O
we O
see O
people O
who O
do O
n't O
appear O
to O
be O
taking O
it O
too O
seriously O
, O
we O
're O
going O
to O
get O
to O
them O
right O
away O
. O

And O
I O
think O
perhaps O
no O
one O
more O
surprised O
than O
some O
of O
the O
people O
running O
those O
firms O
on O
Wall B-FAC
Street I-FAC
. O

You O
have O
also O
expressed O
concern O
about O
excessive O
executive O
compensation O
, O
particularly O
CEO O
compensation O
. O

Is O
there O
really O
anything O
that O
can O
be O
done O
about O
this O
problem O
? O

I O
think O
so O
, O
Lou B-PERSON
. O

I O
think O
the O
real O
next O

When O
I O
visited O
your O
country O
in O
1994 B-DATE
, O
I O
recall O
saying O
to O
President O
Yeltsin B-PERSON
that O
he O
and O
I O
spent O
most O
of O
our O
lives O
believing O
such O
a O
visit O
would O
never O
happen O
, O
and O
that O
I O
hoped O
he O
was O
as O
delighted O
as O
I O
was O
to O
be O
proved O
wrong O
. O

I O
'm O
just O
as O
delighted O
now O
, O
nine B-DATE
years I-DATE
later I-DATE
, O
to O
be O
able O
to O
welcome O
you O
here O
and O
to O
learn O
about O
the O
great O
changes O
which O
have O
occurred O
in O
your O
country O
since O
I O
was O
there O
. O

Russia B-GPE
has O
established O
itself O
as O
our O
partner O
and O
our O
friend O
. O

We O
work O
together O
bilatarily O
and O
on O
the O
international O
stage O
, O
and O
we O
are O
developing O
new O
links O
all O
the O
time O
in O
fields O
of O
commerce O
, O
culture O
, O
counterterrorism O
, O
energy O
, O
education O
environment O
. O

I O
know O
you O
will O
be O
seeing O
evidence O
of O
some O
of O
this O
during O
your O
visit O
. O

Mr. O
President O
, O
it O
is O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
a O
sign O
of O
genuine O
friendship O
that O
we O
are O
able O
to O
have O
disagreements O
, O
but O
remain O
firm O
partners O
. O

It O
is O
no O
secret O
that O
the O
significant O
differences O
between O
our O
two B-CARDINAL
countries O
earlier B-DATE
this I-DATE
year I-DATE
on O
how O
best O
to O
handle O
Iraq B-GPE
, O
but O
we O
are O
now O
able O
to O
look O
forward O
together O
firmly O
in O
agreement O
on O
the O
route O
we O
have O
decided O
in O
the B-ORG
United I-ORG
Nations I-ORG
, O
although O
, O
the O
tragic O
loss O
of O
British B-NORP
lives O
today B-DATE
reminds O
us O
all O
of O
the O
difficulties O
to O
be O
faced O
. O

But O
as O
we O
look O
ahead O
, O
we O
know O
that O
our O
long O
- O
term O
partnership O
is O
of O
profound O
importance O
to O
both O
of O
us O
. O

This O
is O
clearly O
evident O
, O
if O
we O
look O
beyond O
the O
challenges O
of O
international O
politics O
. O

In O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
few I-DATE
months I-DATE
alone O
, O
we O
have O
heard O
the O
announcements O
of O
major O
investments O
in O
Russia B-GPE
by O
British B-NORP
companies O
. O

We O
have O
also O
heard O
a O
different O
sign O
of O
Sir O
Paul B-PERSON
McCartney I-PERSON
playing O
to O
enthusiastic O
crowds O
in O
Red B-FAC
Square I-FAC
, O
and O
we O
, O
in O
turn O
, O
have O
been O
enthralled O
by O
the O
celebrations O
of O
your O
own O
city O
in O
Petersburg B-GPE
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
work O
continues O
to O
bring O
the O
young O
people O
of O
our O
countries O
closer O
together O
through O
language O
, O
teaching O
, O
school O
exchanges O
and O
university O
programs O
. O

We O
have O
a O
vibrant O
and O
exciting O
relationship O
from O
which O
we O
both O
derive O
mass O
benefit O
. O

Mr. O
President O
, O
