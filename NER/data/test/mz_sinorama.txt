Since O
the O
place O
now O
known O

Tanshui B-GPE
was O
at O
the O
tail O
end O
-LRB- O
wei O
-RRB- O
of O
this O
stone O

, O
it O
came O
to O

called O
Huwei B-GPE

Tanshui B-GPE
occupied O
an O
important O
place O
in O
the O
transport O
network O
connecting O
Taiwan B-GPE
to O
Southeast B-LOC
Asia I-LOC
. O

Even O
before O
the O
arrival O
of O
Westerners B-NORP
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
Han B-NORP
Chinese I-NORP
often O
crossed O
over O
from O
China B-GPE
to O
Tanshui B-GPE
, O
which O
is O
relatively O
close O
to O
the O
mainland O

Here O
they O
engaged O
in O

the O
Pingpu B-NORP
-LRB- O

-RRB- O
aborigines O

with O

being O
the O

As O
Western B-NORP
powers O
turned O
their O
eyes O
to O
Asia B-LOC
, O
Tanshui B-GPE
became O
strategically O
important O
. O

In O
the B-DATE
17th I-DATE
century I-DATE
, O
first O
the O
Spanish B-NORP
, O
and O
then O
the O
Dutch B-NORP
, O
built O
forts O
here O
as O
symbols O
of O
their O
claims O

In O
the B-DATE
mid-17th I-DATE
century I-DATE
, O
China B-GPE
took O
control O
of O
Taiwan B-GPE

and O
closed O
Tanshui B-GPE
to O
international O

Later O
, O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
Sino B-NORP

French I-NORP
war O
of O
1884 B-DATE
, O
Tanshui B-GPE
was O
again O
opened O

During O
Tanshui B-GPE

golden O
age O
, O
large O
and O
small O
boats O
were O
constantly O
coming O

going O
in O
the O

and O
it O
was O
not O
unusual O
to O

enormous O

In O
the B-DATE

the I-DATE
Qing I-DATE

, O
Tanshui B-GPE
was O
the O

However O
, O
during O
the O

as O
a O
result O

and O
because O
the O
Japanese B-NORP
invested O
a O
huge O
effort O
in O
developing O
the O

Tanshui B-GPE
faded O

never O

Tanshui B-GPE
is O
a O
place O
of O
many O

a O
place O
that O
invites O
reflection O
on O

In O
the O

" O
a O

in O

the O

that O
this O

If O
you O
go O
up O

you O
will O
discover O
the O
head O

an O

This O
could O
be O
a O

the O
major O
Japanese B-NORP
infrastructure O

, O
the O

Or O
you O
could O
walk O

Or O
you O
could O
visit O
the O

As O
you O
watch O
the O
children O
laughing O

you O
can O
think O
back O
to O
the O
time O
when O
the O
Japanese B-NORP
government O
did O
not O
allow O
Taiwanese B-NORP

Japanese B-NORP

together O
. O

Under O
those O

, O
Tamkang B-ORG

became O
a O

Gradually O

that O
Tanshui B-GPE

This O

that O
, O

the O

But O
I O
think O
that O
it O
may O
be O
the O
river O
itself O
that O
is O
moaning O
. O

In O
1998 B-DATE
, O
the O
government O
produced O
a O
plan O
for O
a O
riverside O
expressway O
to O
Tanshui B-GPE
. O

The O
road O
, O
which O
was O
expected O
to O
have O
three B-CARDINAL
levels O
, O
would O
have O
cut O
through O
rare O
mangroves O
and O
created O
a O
barrier O
between O
the O
river O
and O
the O
town O
of O
Tanshui B-GPE

If O
the O
plan O
had O
been O
implemented O
, O
people O
who O
wanted O
to O
go O
to O
Tanshui B-GPE
and O
gaze O
out O
over O
the O
river O
would O
have O
had O
to O
find O
some O
very O
high O
vantage O
point O
in O

to O
do O
so O
! O

Fortunately O
, O
thanks O
to O
efforts O
by O
cultural O
and O
environmental O
activists O
from O
Tanshui B-GPE
, O
the O
plan O
was O

a O
question O
remains O

Is O
something O

this O

come O
sooner O
or O
later O
? O

" O
For O
the O
purposes O

the O

will O
have O

out O
that O

When O

, O
the O
whole O

manufacturing O
the O

, O
requires O
four O

" O
There O

two B-CARDINAL

" O
he O

" O
One B-CARDINAL
is O
that O
all O

You O
can O
assemble O
a O

completely O
from O

within O
50 B-QUANTITY
kilometers I-QUANTITY
. O
" O

And O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
key O
is O
that O
when O
you O
deal O
with O
Taiwanese B-NORP
companies O
, O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
endure O
a O
long O
contract O
process O
. O

Everything O
starts O
rolling O
with O
a O

business O

are O
always O
playing O
golf O

singing O
karaoke O
or O
chewing O

together O
. O

" O
Everyone O
is O
always O
asking O
how O
everyone O

is O
doing O
- O
it O
's O
a O
way O
of O

up O

Andrew B-PERSON

that O
when O
the O

, O
" O
Even O

had O
to O
be O
brought O

" O

But O
now O
the O

virtually O
all O

for O
very O
little O

" O
What O
does O

" O
The O
Taiwan B-GPE

he O
does O
acknowledge O
the O
precariousness O
of O
their O
position O
in O
hostile O
territory O
. O

Taiwan B-GPE
business O
interests O
can O
not O
put O
down O

Because O
of O
Taiwan B-GPE
's O
experience O
with O
rapid O
modernization O
, O
many O
CCP B-ORG
cadres O
have O
sought O
employment O
with O
Taiwanese B-NORP
firms O
, O
hoping O
to O
learn O
from O
the O
masters O

At O
the O
first B-ORDINAL

, O
they O
leave O

how O
these O

compete O
with O
the O
very O
Taiwan B-GPE

that O

This O
scenario O
should O
be O

" O
It O
happens O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
too O
. O
" O

Apart O
from O
keeping O
up O

, O
it O
is O
even O
more O
important O
that O
Taiwan B-GPE

raise O
their O

. O

" O
Many O

" O
says O
Yeh B-PERSON

find O
it O
difficult O
to O

TBAD B-ORG
takes O

H.D. B-PERSON
Yeh I-PERSON
points O
out O
that O
in O
1998 B-DATE
Taiwan B-GPE
had O
an O
overall O
trade O
surplus O
of O
US$ B-MONEY
5.9 I-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
, O
and O
a O
surplus O
of O
US$ B-MONEY
12.76 I-MONEY

with O
mainland O
China B-GPE
. O

If O
not O
for O
its O
trade O
with O
the O
PRC B-GPE
, O
therefore O
, O
Taiwan B-GPE
would O
have O
had O
a O
trade O
deficit O
. O

" O
We O
make O
our O
money O
here O
, O
but O
we O
pay O
taxes O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
and O
most O
of O
our O
families O
and O
children O
do O
most O
of O
their O
consumer O
spending O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
" O

Chang B-PERSON
notes O
that O
after O

, O
Taiwan B-GPE
business O

TBAD B-ORG
contributed O

all O

Hence O
, O
he O
argues O
that O
it O

very O
unfair O

say O
that O
Taiwanese B-NORP
businesses O
in O
the O
mainland O
are O
n't O
contributing O
to O
Taiwan B-GPE

The O
question O
is O
, O
how O
should O
the O
ROC B-GPE

view O
Taiwan B-GPE

? O

Today O
, O
the O
enterovirus O

is O
in O
the O
testing O
phase O
, O
and O
DR. B-ORG
Chip I-ORG
is O
collaborating O
with O
Taipei B-ORG

to O
obtain O

to O
establish O
the O
accuracy O
of O
the O

What O
is O
so O
remarkable O
about O
the O
enterovirus O
detection O
chip O
when O
compared O
with O
traditional O
test O
methods O
? O

There O
are O
68 B-CARDINAL
known O
forms O
of O
non-polio O
enterovirus O
. O

The O
detection O
chip O
does O
not O
simply O
determine O
whether O
a O
person O
is O
infected O
with O
enterovirus O
, O
but O
can O
also O
differentiate O
between O
different O
virus O
groups O
, O
for O
instance O
showing O
whether O
a O
sample O
contains O
the O
deadly O
Entero O
71 O
virus O
, O
or O
Coxsackie O
A16 O
, O
which O
is O
easily O
confused O
with O
Entero O
71 O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
chip O
and O
its O
accompanying O
PCR O
kit O
greatly O
reduce O
the O
time O
required O
for O
testing O
. O

Wang B-PERSON

notes O
that O
traditional O
bacterial O
and O
viral O
cultures O
take O
seven O
to O
ten O
days O
to O
prepare O
, O
and O
even O
with O
the O
newer O
molecular O
biology O
testing O
techniques O
it O
takes O
three B-DATE
days I-DATE
to O
get O
a O
result O
. O

But O
DR. B-ORG
Chip I-ORG
has O
developed O
methods O
to O
reduce O
the O
sample O
preparation O
time O
, O
which O
enables O
a O
result O
to O
be O
obtained O
in O
only B-TIME
six I-TIME
hours I-TIME
when O
used O
in O
combination O
with O
their O
enterovirus O

suggest O
that O
the O

over O
a O

. O

" O
In O

states O
that O
at O

they O
are O
actively O
developing O
a O
" O

" O
with O
a O
wide O
range O
of O

. O

Pan O
explains O
that O
in O
clinical O
practice O
, O
the O
causes O
of O

are O
difficult O
to O
quickly O
diagnose O

A O
" O

" O
bearing O
the O

could O
be O
used O
to O
determine O
the O
cause O
of O
the O

and O
the O
type O
of O

involved O
would O
be O
a O
valuable O
tool O
. O

However O
, O
Pan B-PERSON
points O
out O
that O
because O
of O
the O
difficulties O
in O
substantially O
reducing O
the O
time O
needed O
for O
sample O
preparation O
, O
the O
usefulness O
of O
such O
a O
fever O

is O
still O
limited O
, O
so O
that O
it O
can O
not O
yet O
be O
widely O
promoted O
. O

Where O
the O
real O
money O
is O

At O
present O
, O
most O
applications O
for O

are O
in O
academic O
research O
and O
the O
development O
of O
new O

. O

Demand O
for O
them O
is O
growing O
rapidly O
. O

Johnsee B-PERSON
Lee I-PERSON
says O
that O
according O
to O
US B-GPE
market O
research O
estimates O
, O
the O
worldwide O
annual O
consumption O
of O
microarray O
chips O
is O
currently O
around O
250,000 B-CARDINAL
; O
in O
two B-DATE
years I-DATE
this O
is O
expected O
to O
grow O
to O
1.2 B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
. O

Based O
on O
a O
market O
price O
per O
chip O
of O
US$ B-MONEY
1,000 I-MONEY
, O
the O
size O
of O
the O
world O
market O
in O
biochips O
could O
grow O
to O
US$ B-MONEY
1.2 I-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
in O
2003 B-DATE
, O
and O
to O
US$ B-MONEY
40 I-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
over O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
decade I-DATE
. O

Thus O
some O
people O
have O
set O
their O
sights O
on O
the O
biochip O
market O
, O
and O
believe O
that O
following O
Taiwan B-GPE
's O
success O
in O
the O
semiconductor O
field O
, O
the O
island O
could O
go O
on O
to O
be O
a O
major O

Be O
that O
as O
it O
may O
, O
the O
small O
number O
of O
biochip O
companies O
so O
far O
established O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
still O
find O
their O
market O
in O

. O

Although O
they O
are O
also O
actively O
developing O

, O
what O
interests O
them O
most O
is O
not O
biochips O
per O

nor O
are O
they O
content O
merely O
to O

" O
The O

are O
only O
a O
tool O
, O
and O
the O
big O

is O
not O
in O

What O
counts O
is O
the O

BMEC B-ORG

chi I-PERSON
uses O
the O
example O
of O
blood O
screening O
for O
a O
blood O
bank O
to O
illustrate O
the O
difference O
between O
the O
two O
kinds O
of O
chips O
. O

To O
test O
a O
blood O
sample O
using O
a O
microarray O
chip O
, O
the O
sample O
must O
first O
go O
through O
many O
preparatory O
steps O
such O
as O
purification O
, O
nucleotide O
extraction O
, O
copying O
, O
amplification O
and O
labeling O
before O
being O
put O
onto O
the O
chip O
where O
the O
" O
hybridization O
" O
reaction O
takes O
place O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
results O
are O
analyzed O
using O
a O
detection O
system O
. O

Hence O
these O
chips O
are O
only O
suitable O
for O
use O
in O
the O
laboratory O
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
with O
a O
lab O
- O
on O
- O
a O

system O
, O
all O
the O
laboratory O
preparation O
stages O
will O
be O
done O
on O
the O

itself O
, O
so O
that O
the O
user O
need O
only O
place O
a O
drop O
of O
blood O
directly O
onto O
the O

to O
obtain O
a O
result O
. O

At O

and O
no O
such O

Jerry B-PERSON
Huang I-PERSON
notes O
that O
DNA O
chips O
are O
an O
indispensable O
research O
tool O
in O
molecular O
biology O
. O

On O
one B-CARDINAL
little O
biochip O
, O
tens B-CARDINAL
of I-CARDINAL
thousands I-CARDINAL
of O
gene O
segments O
can O
be O
arranged O
to O
simultaneously O
detect O
the O
expression O
of O
tens B-CARDINAL
of I-CARDINAL
thousands I-CARDINAL
of O
genes O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
whereas O
in O
the O
past O
researchers O
had O
to O
investigate O
each O
gene O
individually O
, O
today O
, O
using O
biochips O
, O
they O
can O
obtain O
test O
results O
for O
tens B-CARDINAL
of I-CARDINAL
thousands I-CARDINAL
of O
genes O
at O
once O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
biochips O
not O
only O
can O
speed O
the O
pace O
of O
research O
, O
but O
can O
also O
replace O
laboratory O
animals O
such O
as O

many O
experiments O
, O
with O
tests O
being O
carried O
out O
directly O
on O

Thus O
as O

are O
not O
only O

also O
more O
humane O

Taiwan B-GPE
really O
repeat O
its O

the O

BMEC B-ORG
director O
Johnsee B-PERSON
Lee I-PERSON
observes O
that O
the O
level O
of O
scientific O
and O
technical O
know O
- O
how O
required O
for O
biochip O
production O
is O
very O
high O
, O
so O
that O
the O
opportunities O
for O
contract O
manufacture O
are O
limited O
. O

However O
, O
due O
to O
Taiwan B-GPE
's O
early O
entry O
into O
biochip O
research O
and O
development O
, O
and O
the O
high O
state O
of O
development O
of O
its O
semiconductor O
industry O
, O
the O
island O
is O
well O
supplied O
with O
relevant O
technology O
and O
skills O
. O

Thus O
, O
says O
Lee B-PERSON
, O
" O
Taiwan B-GPE
should O
have O
opportunities O
to O
enter O
this O
field O
not O
merely O
as O
a O
contract O
manufacturer O
. O
" O

The O
potential O
and O
importance O
of O
biochips O
is O
plain O
to O
see O
, O
but O
in O
this O
new O
, O
interdisciplinary O
industry O
, O
there O
are O
still O
many O
obstacles O
and O
difficulties O
to O
overcome O
. O

Apart O
from O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
technology O
is O
not O
yet O
mature O
, O
and O
that O
generally O
accepted O
, O
mutually O
compatible O
international O
standards O
have O
not O
yet O
emerged O
, O
the O
biggest O
bottleneck O
for O
biochips O
at O
the O
moment O
is O
the O
many O
thousands O
of O
patents O
which O
have O
been O
taken O
out O
in O
the O
field O
, O
which O
limit O
the O
avenues O
available O
to O
each O
player O
. O

" O
Because O
this O
area O
is O
a O
patents O
minefield O
, O
it O
's O
impossible O
to O
create O
a O
product O
which O
from O
start O
to O
finish O
does O
n't O
infringe O
on O
anyone O
else O
's O
patents O
, O
" O
says O
Johnsee B-PERSON
Lee I-PERSON
. O

In O
his O
view O
, O
this O
problem O
may O
be O
resolved O
in O
the O
future O
by O
the O
exchange O
of O
patented O
technologies O
between O
players O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
at O
this O
stage O
companies O
must O
actively O
carry O
out O
research O
and O
development O
, O
and O
obtain O
international O
patents O
, O
in O
order O
to O
have O
bargaining O
chips O
in O
future O
negotiations O
. O

At O
present O
, O
the O
BMEC B-ORG
has O
over O
10 B-CARDINAL
patents O
pending O
in O
the O
areas O
of O
microfluidics O
biochips O
, O

surface O
processing O

and O

and O

. O

Pushing O
the O
envelope O

Although O
at O
their O
present O
stage O
of O
development O
, O
biochips O
are O
already O
a O
great O
help O
to O
researchers O
, O
they O
are O
still O
far O
removed O
from O
ordinary O
people O
's O
lives O
. O

But O
one O
day O
they O
will O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
all O
our O
lives O
. O

" O
Applications O
and O
commercialization O
are O
our O
goal O
, O
" O
says O
Johnsee B-PERSON
Lee I-PERSON
. O

He O
says O
that O
only O
if O
research O
results O
are O
commercialized O
does O
research O
produce O
an O
economic O
payback O
. O

Equally O
, O
to O
have O
a O
really O
broad O
market O
biochips O
need O
to O
go O
beyond O
the O
laboratory O
researcher O
, O
and O
into O
hospitals O
, O
clinics O
and O
homes O
, O
and O
to O
individual O
users O
. O

Lee B-PERSON
points O
out O
that O
before O
biochips O
will O
be O
worth O
commercializing O
, O
sample O
preparation O
needs O
to O
be O
made O
convenient O
, O
reading O
results O
must O
be O
simple O
and O
easy O
, O
the O
chips O
' O
speed O
and O
accuracy O
must O
be O
high O
, O
and O
their O
cost O
must O
be O
low O
. O

He O
predicts O
that O
in O
one B-DATE
to I-DATE
two I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
biochips O
will O
be O
suitable O
for O
use O
in O
supplemental O
tests O
, O
and O
after O
around B-DATE
three I-DATE
years I-DATE
for O
high O
- O
throughput O
screening O
; O
in O
five O
years O
time O
it O
should O
be O
possible O
to O
develop O
them O
into O
general O

tools O
which O
will O
be O
as O
easy O
to O

IBMS B-ORG

Peck I-PERSON
agrees O
that O
in O
the O
foreseeable O
future O
, O
diagnostic O

will O
enable O
everyone O
to O
learn O
their O
current O
state O
of O

and O
know O
what O
diseases O
they O
may O
develop O
in O
the O

But O
in O
a O
situation O
where O

ahead O
of O

, O
the O

Mankind O

when O

in O

The O
wax O
apple O
is O
a O
tropical O
fruit O
originating O
from O
the O
Malay B-NORP
peninsula O
. O

The O
Dutch B-NORP
brought O
it O
to O
Taiwan B-GPE
from O
Java B-GPE
, O
in O
the B-DATE
17th I-DATE
century I-DATE
, O
and O
it O
became O
commonly O
grown O
as O
a O
shade O
- O
giving O
tree O
. O

Old O
folk O
in O
the O
South B-LOC
remember O
when O
wax O
apples O
were O
" O
just O
something O
to O
munch O
on O
" O
- O
the O
kind O
of O
fruit O
that O
grew O
freely O
and O
that O
you O
could O
help O
yourself O
to O
. O

But O
wax O
apples O
have O
increased O
in O
value O
during O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
30 I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
thanks O
to O
advances O
in O
the O
way O
that O
they O
are O
grown O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
" O
bag O
- O
wrap O
" O
method O
was O
originally O
a O
way O
of O
protecting O
budding O
fruit O
from O
birds O
, O
but O
once O
it O
was O
introduced O
to O
Linpien B-GPE
, O
in O
around O
1994 B-DATE
, O
farmers O
found O
it O
enabled O
them O
to O
grow O
more O
lustrous O
, O
shiny O
- O
looking O
wax O
apples O
, O
with O
less O
pesticide O
on O
the O
skin O
. O

The O
method O
soon O
caught O
on O
throughout O
the O
district O
. O

Another O
popular O
technique O
involves O
covering O
the O
trees O
with O
black O
mosquito O
nets O
to O
improve O
yields O
. O

This O
reduces O
the O
amount O
of O
sunlight O
reaching O
the O
trees O
, O
causing O
nutrients O
from O
the O
leaves O
and O
branches O
to O
be O
diverted O
into O
producing O
fruit O
. O

The O
net O
- O
covered O
trees O
blossom O
earlier O
and O
produce O
more O
fruit O
. O

As O
a O
result O
of O
this O
technique O
, O
black O
pearl O
wax O
apples O
are O
now O
available O
throughout O
most B-DATE

The O
" O

did O

originate O
in O
Linpien B-GPE
, O
but O
it O
was O
Linpien B-GPE
wax O
apples O
that O
made O
the O
variety O
famous O
and O
prompted O
the O
dramatic O
growth O
of O
its O
market O
. O

In O

I O

which O
Mr. O

gave O
me O

He O
said O
that O
to O
be O
a O
fearless O
champion O
of O
social O
justice O
, O
as O
is O
expected O
of O
a O
journalist O
, O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
, O
apart O
from O
energy O
and O
vitality O
, O
is O
modesty O
. O

You O
have O
to O
treat O
everybody O
the O
same O
, O
and O
not O
be O
overawed O
by O
the O
great O
and O
powerful O
. O

A O
president O
or O
a O
street O
sweeper O
deserve O
the O
same O
respect O
as O
a O
human O
being O
, O
and O
should O
both O
be O
treated O
the O
same O
way O
. O

Funnily O
enough O
, O
an O
unassuming O
attitude O
is O
also O
advantageous O
in O
relations O
with O
the O
opposite O
sex O
. O

Chinese B-NORP
society O
is O
male O
dominated O
, O
and O
women O
are O
mostly O
regarded O
as O
having O
a O
subsidiary O
role O
. O

In O
this O
kind O
of O
unfair O
situation O
, O
an O
upstanding O
man O
should O
cherish O
and O
respect O
women O
all O
the O
more O
. O

A O
considerate O
attitude O
can O
be O
expressed O
in O
little O
things O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
when O
you O
see O
that O
a O
hair O
has O
fallen O
onto O
a O
female O
friend O
's O
shoulder O
, O
you O
should O
lightly O
pick O
it O
off O
for O
her O
, O
and O
throw O
it O
away O
or O
put O
it O
in O
your O
pocket O
. O

If O
sincere O
, O
this O
kind O
of O
action O
is O
attractive O
in O
a O
man O
. O

If O
a O
woman O
expresses O
her O
liking O
for O
you O
, O
then O
no O
matter O
whether O
she O
is O
pretty O
, O
or O
whether O
you O
find O
her O
attractive O
, O
you O
should O
respond O
in O
the O
same O
way O

and O
with O
the O
same O
respect O

When O
I O
was O
a O
young O
reporter O
stationed O
in O
Europe B-LOC
, O
there O
was O
a O
British B-NORP
woman O
reporter O
who O
liked O
me O
very O
much O
. O

Once O
I O
was O
driving O
her O
somewhere O
to O
report O
a O
story O
when O
we O
had O
an O
accident O
, O
and O
she O
suffered O
some O
badly O
broken O
bones O
. O

Although O
I O
was O
n't O
attracted O
to O
her O
in O
that O
way O
, O
I O
went O
to O
see O
her O
every O
day O
in O
hospital O
, O
and O
this O
left O
a O
deep O
impression O
on O
her O
of O
how O
considerate O
Chinese B-NORP
men O
can O
be O
. O

Looking O
back O

I O
've O
hardly O
had O
any O
really O
bad O
experiences O
in O
my O

with O

and O
this O
is O
because O
just O

in O
my O

I O
've O
always O
maintained O
a O
self O

was O

" O

But O
he O

tremendously O
well O

a O
beautiful O

and O
for O
a O
time O
he O
was O

His O

beauty O

So O
I O
say O
, O
" O
handsome O

as O
handsome O
does O

" O

I O
was O
imprisoned O
by O
both O
the O
Kuomintang B-ORG

the O

, O
and O
at O
times O
I O
might O
have O
been O

Perhaps O
other O
people O
in O
the O
same O
situation O
might O
have O
wallowed O
in O
self O

pity O
, O
but O
I O
saw O
it O
as O
a O
rare O
opportunity O
in O
life O
. O

In O
1951 B-DATE
, O
in O
a O
dark O
prison O

during O
a O
big O
Communist B-NORP
purge O
, O
what O
came O
into O
my O
mind O
was O
not O
fear O
of O
death O
. O

Instead O
, O
I O
wondered O
what O
kind O
of O

my O
death O
would O
merit O
in O
the O
newspapers O
. O

Perhaps O
it O
was O
this O
eternal O
optimism O
which O
changed O
my O
frame O
of O
mind O
and O
my O
appearance O
. O

This O
is O
the O
advice O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
give O
young O
people O
: O

it O
's O
true O
that O
good O
looks O
can O
come O
from O
external O
grooming O
, O
wearing O
nice O
clothes O
, O
or O
wearing O
earrings O
; O
and O
perhaps O
you O
can O
get O
other O
people O
's O
attention O
by O
creating O
your O
own O
special O
look O
. O

But O
do O
n't O
overdo O
it O
. O

It O
is O
appropriate O
dress O
, O
and O
a O
temperament O
developed O
through O
study O
and O
practice O
, O
which O
really O
make O

Middle O
age O
and O
the O
changes O
it O
brings O
are O
like O
a O
revolving O
door O
. O

Many O
people O
peacefully O
go O
through O
it O
, O
growing O
wiser O
and O
losing O
their O
rough O
edges O
. O

A O
minority O
do O
n't O
know O
whether O
to O
advance O
or O
retreat O
and O
get O
caught O
in O
it O
like O
a O
trap O

Middle O
age O
is O
a O
time O
where O
one O
wears O
more O
hats O
than O
at O
any O
other O
time O
in O
one O

life O
, O
when O

As O
a O
result O
, O
the O
crises O
experienced O
by O
a O
minority O
of O
middle O
- O
aged O
people O
can O
involve O
a O
lot O
of O
other O
people O
, O
so O
their O
impact O
can O
not O
be O

. O

Middle O

those B-DATE

is O
both O
the O
time O
of O
life O
of O
greatest O
glory O
and O
the O
time O
of O
life O
that O
's O
easiest O
to O
overlook O
. O

In O
comparison O
to O
youth O
or O
old O
age O
, O
the O
middle O
years O
are O
often O
thought O
of O
as O
the O
time O
when O
power O
, O
ability O
, O
wealth O
, O
and O
physical O
strength O
are O
all O
at O
or O
near O
their O
peak O
, O
so O
that O
one O
has O
no O
excuse O
for O
feeling O
melancholy O
. O

Even O
if O
there O
are O
problems O
, O
it O
is O
commonly O
thought O
that O
one O
should O
be O

Social O
bias O
makes O
many O
of O
the O
middle O

afraid O
to O
discuss O
their O
problems O
. O

This O
is O
particularly O
the O
case O
for O
men O
, O
who O
generally O
find O
it O
difficult O
to O
talk O
about O
their O
feelings O

But O
by O
keeping O
everything O
inside O
, O
they O
may O
cause O
irreparable O
harm O

their O
health O

In O

cancer O

sudden O

and O

have O
become O
all O
too O
common O
during O

which O
shows O
that O
the O
psychological O
problems O
of O
the O
middle O

should O
not O
be O

How O
do O
you O
safely O
pass O

the O

Here O

, O
looks O
at O
the O
question O
from O
the O
angle O
of O
developmental O
psychology O
. O

He O
points O
out O
that O
the O
path O
of O
life O
is O
continuous O
: O
everyone O
moves O
from O
infancy O
and O
childhood O
, O
to O
youth O
and O
middle O
age O
. O

Smoothly O
passing O
through O
any O
period O
of O
life O
helps O
make O
getting O
through O
the O
next O
period O
easier O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
the O
people O
most O
at O
risk O
during O
middle O
age O
are O
those O
who O
have O
had O
difficulties O
earlier O
in O
life O
. O

Foreign O
research O
shows O
that O
those O
with O
high O
social O
and O
economic O
status O
and O
with O
ample O
financial O
resources O
bear O
up O
better O
during O
crisis O
and O
have O
more O
ways O
to O
get O
out O
of O
trouble O
. O

Is O
it O
too O
late O
to O
start O
talking O
about O
these O
problems O
when O
you O
are O
already O
middle O
- O
aged O

argues O
that O
any O
step O
in O
the O
right O
direction O
is O
worthwhile O
, O
no O
matter O
when O
you O
start O
. O

Middle O
- O
aged O
problems O
are O
rather O
predictable O
, O
and O
they O
're O
not O
hard O
to O
avoid O
. O

Are O
you O
worried O
that O
your O
marriage O
is O
growing O
stale O
? O

Then O
no O
matter O
how O
busy O
you O
are O
, O
you O
've O
got O
to O
set O
aside O
some O
time O
to O
be O
with O
your O
spouse O
. O

Are O
you O
worried O
about O
losing O
your O
job O
? O

Then O
start O
developing O
a O
second B-ORDINAL
skill O
and O
get O
into O
the O
habit O
of O
saving O
and O
managing O
your O
money O
. O

Are O
you O
worried O
about O
how O
to O
care O
for O
your O
parents O
when O
they O
get O
old O
and O
sick O
? O

Then O
spend O
more O
time O
with O
them O
, O
and O
encourage O
them O
to O
get O
more O
exercise O
and O
take O
care O
of O
themselves O
. O

There O
are O
so O
many O
things O
to O
be O
concerned O
about O
during O
middle O
age O
that O
you O
had O
better O
get O
an O
early O
start O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
you O
'll O
end O
up O
being O
overwhelmed O
. O

2. B-CARDINAL
Start O
over O

In O
China B-GPE
it O
used O
to O
be O
said O
that O
middle O
age O
was O
the O
period O
when O
one O
was O
" O
heir O
to O
the O
ancient O
sages O
and O
the O
teacher O
of O
posterity O
. O
" O

But O
now O
times O
are O
changing O
so O
fast O
that O
perhaps O
the O
lessons O
of O
past O
experience O
are O
no O
longer O
suitable O
for O
solving O
today O
's O
problems O
. O

To O
assume O
a O
posture O
of O
superiority O
based O
on O
one O
's O
seniority O
will O
make O
one O
despised O
. O

Hence O
, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
cast O
aside O
one O
's O
old O
self O
and O
start O
over O
. O

Chiu B-PERSON
notes O
that O
many O
middle O
- O
aged O
who O
have O
worked O
diligently O
for O
years O
to O
attain O
management O
positions O
look O
down O
on O
the O
younger O
generation O
for O
being O
reckless O
and O
disorganized O
, O
but O
they O
do O
n't O
realize O
that O
creativity O
and O
energy O
may O
be O
ready O
to O
explode O
from O
underneath O
these O
flaws O
. O

Stuck O
in O
the O
past O
and O
full O
of O
bitterness O
, O
they O
may O
end O
up O
getting O
discarded O
onto O
the O
scrap O
heap O
of O
history O
. O

With O
each O
new O
era O
, O
role O
models O
change O
. O

Until O
the O
new O
role O
models O
have O
been O
established O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
maintain O
flexibility O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
today O
's O
middle O
- O
aged O
Chinese B-NORP
women O
are O
the O
first O
to O
have O
obtained O
advanced O
degrees O
and O
to O
have O
come O
in O
contact O
with O
the O
women O
's O
liberation O
movement O
. O

They O
set O
high O
expectations O
for O
themselves O
, O
but O
their O
disappointments O
are O
likewise O
large O
. O

Many O
women O
are O
torn O
between O
conflicting O
desires O
: O
to O
be O
good O
homemakers O
like O
their O
mothers O
and O
to O
have O
successful O
careers O
like O
their O
fathers O
. O

Their O
candles O
are O
burning O
at O
both O
ends O
, O
because O
they O
are O
trying O
to O
live O
up O
to O
two B-CARDINAL
old O
role O
models O
rather O
than O
establishing O
a O
new O
one O
for O
themselves O
. O

Then O
there O
are O
men O
who O
insist O
upon O
being O
strict O
fathers O
and O
disciplinarians O
or O
staying O
at O
the O
same O
company O
until O
they O
retire O
. O

And O
there O
are O
women O
who O
are O
determined O
to O
play O
the O
role O
of O
the O
traditional O
Chinese B-NORP
wife O
and O
mother O
. O

Ignoring O
the O
changing O
times O
, O
they O
place O
tremendous O
pressure O
on O
themselves O
. O

3. B-CARDINAL
Turn O
the O

Life O

a O
process O
that O

from O
the O

, O
getting O
to O
the O
heart O
of O
the O

. O

Lu B-PERSON
explains O
that O
as O
children O
people O
yearn O
for O
the O
affection O
of O
their O
parents O
; O
as O
adolescents O
they O
want O
the O
affirmation O
of O
their O
peers O
; O
and O
as O
adults O
, O
they O
set O
their O
sights O
on O
educational O
qualifications O
, O
finding O
a O
good O
job O
, O
making O
money O
, O
marrying O
a O
good O
spouse O
and O
so O
forth O
. O

Everyone O
puts O
the O
emphasis O
on O
outward O
manifestations O
of O
success O
, O
and O
this O
emphasis O
on O
the O
glitter O
of O
outward O
achievement O
continues O
up O
to O
middle O
age O
. O

" O
By O
middle O
age O
, O
people O
have O
gotten O
from O
the O
outside O
world O
just O
about O
all O
they O
can O
, O
" O
says O
Lu B-PERSON
. O

" O
What O
they O
have O
n't O
attained O
yet O
they O
probably O
wo O
n't O
attain O
ever O
, O
so O
it O
's O
not O
worth O
getting O
all O
worked O
up O
about O
it O
. O

This O
is O
the O
time O
of O
life O
when O
the O
doubts O
set O
in O
. O
" O

Many O
middle O
- O
aged O
people O
begin O
to O
ask O
themselves O
, O
" O
Is O
this O
really O
what O
I O
want O
? O

What O
has O
been O
the O
point O
of O
all O
my O
hard O
striving O
? O
" O

When O
the O
doubts O
come O
, O
some O
people O
continue O
trying O
to O
find O
answers O
from O
outside O
, O
thinking O
that O
everything O
would O
be O
fine O
if O
they O
could O
just O
change O
jobs O
or O
wives O
! O

But O
then O
they O
rashly O
switch O
jobs O
or O
foolishly O
get O
involved O
in O
an O
affair O
only O
to O
find O
that O
they O
've O
just O
made O
things O
worse O
. O

" O
In O
middle O
age O
you O
start O
to O
listen O
to O
what O
's O
going O
on O
inside O
, O
" O
says O
Lu B-PERSON
. O

" O
It O
's O
the O
time O
of O
life O
when O
you O
start O
to O
hone O
your O
skills O
at O
conversing O
with O
your O
soul O
. O
" O

People O
ask O
themselves O
: O
Am O
I O
truly O
happy O
? O

Do O
I O
like O
the O

I O
see O
in O
the O

? O

Why O
? O

What O
dreams O
can O
I O
pursue O
? O

At O
this O
point O
, O
there O
is O
no O
longer O
any O
need O
to O
try O
to O
measure O
oneself O
against O
outside O
standards O
. O

Instead O
it O
's O
more O
important O
to O
accept O
oneself O
and O
attempt O
to O
find O
an O
inner O
balance O
. O

" O
One O
need O
not O
compare O
one O

inner O
achievements O
with O
those O
of O

" O
notes O

Everyone O
's O
circumstances O
and O
personalities O
are O
different O
, O
and O
they O
place O
different O
expectations O

It O

not O
a O

Pursuing O
some O
dream O
of O
really O
making O
it O
big O
, O
many O
men O
use O
up O
their O
savings O
, O
leaving O
their O
wives O
as O
the O
sole O
source O
of O
family O
support O
and O
suffering O

in O
a O
foreign O
land O
. O

There O
's O
no O
right O
or O
wrong O
here O
, O
and O
there O
's O
no O
way O
to O
guarantee O
a O
venture O
will O
be O
successful O
, O
but O
beforehand O
one O
must O
at O
least O
be O
realistic O
and O
prepare O
oneself O
psychologically O
for O
all O
possible O
outcomes O
, O
so O
that O
one O
wo O
n't O
suffer O
losses O
larger O
than O
one O
can O
bear O
. O

" O
It O
is O
indeed O
the O
case O
that O
when O
one O
is O
young O
, O
one O

quiver O
is O
full O
of O
arrows O
and O
opportunities O
abound O
, O
so O
that O
one O
can O
shoot O

" O
says O
Chang B-PERSON
by O
way O
of O
analogy O
. O

" O
Once O
you O
get O
into O
middle O
age O
, O
you O
've O
got O
to O
make O
every O
arrow O
count O
. O
" O

Chang B-PERSON
explains O
that O
everyone O
has O
dreams O
, O
and O
that O
continually O
working O
toward O
those O
dreams O
is O
an O
excellent O
method O
of O
relieving O
stress O
at O
any O
age O
. O

Middle O
- O
aged O
people O
have O
heavy O
burdens O
, O
and O
sometimes O
they O
may O
feel O
as O
if O
they O
are O
suffocating O
under O
them O
. O

" O
But O
accomplishing O
a O
lot O
of O
little O
changes O
can O
bring O
about O
a O
big O
change O
. O
" O

If O
you O
make O
an O
effort O
to O
do O
what O
you O
can O
, O
you O
will O
immediately O
find O
that O
your O
burdens O
have O
been O
lightened O
. O

Chang B-PERSON
cites O
this O
example O
: O
Say O
you O
hate O
being O
tied O
up O
by O
your O
work O
, O
and O
would O
like O
to O
go O
back O
to O
school O
. O

Why O
do O
n't O
you O
try O
a O
weekend O
class O
? O

Maybe O
that O
would O
help O
to O
alleviate O
your O
anxiety O
. O

Or O
if O
you O
are O
a O
housewife O
, O
taking O
care O
of O
three B-CARDINAL
generations O
and O
resentful O
that O
you O
ca O
n't O
go O
out O
and O
get O
the O
sense O
of O
accomplishment O
that O
comes O
with O
a O
full O
- O
time O
job O
, O
then O
maybe O
you O
could O
work O
as O
a O
volunteer O
in O
a O
community O
organization O
. O

This O
would O
both O
put O
you O
into O
contact O
with O
other O
people O
and O
help O
you O
gain O
a O
sense O
of O
accomplishment O
. O

And O
you O
can O
help O
to O
sweat O
off O
your O
middle O
- O
aged O
anxieties O
by O
making O
a O
habit O
of O
regularly O
exercising O
. O

What O
's O
more O
, O
do O
n't O
worry O
too O
much O
about O
time O
being O
short O
. O

Remember O
that O
most O
modern O
people O
live O
long O
lives O
that O
can O
be O
divided O
up O
into O
many O
stages O
. O

In O
middle O
age O
, O
when O
you O
discover O
that O
your O
personal O
desires O
are O
coming O
into O
conflict O
with O
the O
demands O
of O
your O
family O
or O
society O
, O
decide O
which O
of O
your O
problems O
are O
the O
most O
urgent O
. O

Do O
n't O
try O
to O
accomplish O
all O
of O
your O
dreams O
at O
once O
. O

Maintain O
an O
unhurried O
frame O
of O
mind O
and O
peacefully O
wait O
for O
opportunities O
to O
present O
themselves O
