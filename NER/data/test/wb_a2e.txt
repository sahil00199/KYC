Speaking O
at O

about O
an O

in O
the O
financing O
and O
support O
of O
the O

of O

against O
the O

" O
Fadil B-PERSON
" O
, O
a O
commander O
in O
the B-ORG
Mahdi I-ORG

tells O
how O
he O
had O
followed O
three B-CARDINAL
Arab B-NORP
Sunni B-NORP
men O
for O
a O
period O
of O
some B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
and O
detained O
them O
when O
they O
were O
crossing O
the B-FAC
Karada I-FAC

, O
after O
having O
informed O
an O
Iraqi B-NORP
army O
road O
block O
close O
to O
the O
area O
that O
he O
was O
pursuing O
" O
terrorists O
" O
, O
then O
attacked O
the O
car O
of O
the O
group O
in O
question O
. O

He O
also O
told O
the B-ORG
British I-ORG
Guardian I-ORG
that O
he O
took O
the O
three B-CARDINAL
men O
to O
Sadr B-GPE
City I-GPE
where O
his O
group O
had O
interrogated O
them O
then O
executed O
them O
, O
indicating O
that O
the O
members O
of O
the B-ORG
Mahdi I-ORG
Army I-ORG
usually O
demanded O
a O
ransom O
from O
the O
families O
of O
the O
hostages O
in O
return O
for O
freeing O
their O
relatives O
, O
and O
would O
liquidate O
them O
anyway O
after O
they O
receive O
the O
ransom O
. O

The O
newspaper O
quoted O
another O
commander O
in O
the B-ORG
Mahdi I-ORG
Army I-ORG
as O
saying O
; O
" O
We O
have O
taken O
10 B-CARDINAL
Sunnis B-NORP
hostages O
, O
we O
will O
get O
a O
ransom O
for O
five B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
, O
then O
we O
will O
kill O
them O
all O
. O
In O
every O
major O
hostage O
- O
taking O
operation O
we O
get O
50 B-MONEY
thousand I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
, O
" O
and O
he O
considered O
it O
to O
be O
the O
best O
business O
a O
person O
could O
be O
running O
in O
Baghdad B-GPE
now O
! O

The O
newspaper O
described O
" O
Fadil B-PERSON
" O
as O
a O
valuable O
commander O
to O
this O
squad O
because O
he O
is O
a O
Shiite B-NORP
who O
grew O
up O
in O
the O
Sunni B-NORP
area O
south O
of O
Baghdad B-GPE
. O

He O
speaks O
in O
the O
Sunni B-NORP
dialect O
and O
carries O
an O
identity O
card O
from O
the O
Yusufiyah B-GPE
Sunni B-NORP
village O
. O

He O
was O
quoted O
as O
saying O
: O
" O
I O
can O
enter O
the O
Sunni B-NORP
areas O
without O
anyone O
knowing O
that O
I O
am O
a O
Shiite B-NORP
. O
" O

It O
pointed O
out O
that O
Fadil B-PERSON
and O
the O
likes O
are O
responsible O
for O
the O
dozens B-CARDINAL
of O
corpses O
which O
are O
being O
found O
daily O
in O
Baghdad B-GPE
. O

This O
means O
that O
the O
Baghdad B-GPE
security O
plan O
will O
not O
be O
successful O
unless O
the O
Americans B-NORP
control O
squads O
such O
as O
these O
to O
put O
breaks O
on O
the O
civil O
war O
. O

" O
Fadil B-PERSON
" O
was O
quoted O
as O
saying O
that O
the B-ORG
Mahdi I-ORG

is O
resorting O
in O
its O
operations O
to O
reinforcements O
from O
Iraqi B-NORP
army O
units O
commanded O
by O
its O
members O
or O
sympathizers O
, O
and O
confirmed O
that O
all O
the O
police O
belong O
to O
the O
Shiite B-NORP
militia O
. O

He O
added O
that O
the B-ORG
Mahdi I-ORG
Army I-ORG
is O
receiving O
logistic O
and O
military O
support O
from O
Iran B-GPE
and O
that O
they O
are O
not O
encountering O
any O
problems O
in O
getting O
weapons O
through O
to O
Sadr B-GPE
City I-GPE
because O
they O
usually O
present O
a O

Rumsfeld B-PERSON
: O
We O
have O
nothing O
to O
apologize O
for O
, O
you O
constituted O
a O
danger O
to O
your O
neighbors O
and O
tried O
to O
acquire O
weapons O
of O
mass O
destruction O
and O
practiced O
dictatorship O
over O
your O
people O
and O
so O
it O
was O
only O
natural O
that O
we O
extended O
our O
hand O
to O
the O
people O
of O
Iraq B-GPE
to O
rid O
them O
of O
the O
perils O
which O
had O
confronted O
them O
for O
more B-CARDINAL
than O
three O
decades O
. O

Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
: O
I O
know O
that O
you O
are O
ignorant O
of O
history O
, O
and O
I O
know O
that O
your O
president O
is O
no O
less O
ignorant O
but O
it O
seems O
that O
you O
have O
continued O
to O
lie O
to O
the O
extent O
that O
you O
now O
believe O
yourselves O
. O

If O
" O
by O
our O
neighbors O
" O
you O
mean O
the B-GPE
Zionist I-GPE
Entity I-GPE
then O
we O
did O
indeed O
form O
a O
danger O
, O
we O
were O
preparing O
to O
liberate O
our O
ravished O
territory O
in O
Palestine B-GPE
. O

This O
is O
the O
wish O
of O
every O
Arab B-NORP
person O
and O
not O
just O
every O
Iraqi B-NORP
. O

For O
this O
is O
Arab B-NORP
land O
and O
its O
people O
are O
Arab B-NORP
, O
and O
the O
Zionists B-NORP
are O
the O
ones O
who O
occupied O
the O
land O
and O
came O
to O
us O
from O
all O
over O
the O
world O
with O
your O
help O
, O
yours O
, O
and O
that O
of O
the O

But O
if O
you O
meant O
Kuwait B-GPE
, O
I O
want O
to O
ask O
you O
. O

Did O
you O
withdraw O
from O
Kuwait B-GPE
or O
not O
? O

Rumsfeld B-PERSON
: O
These O
are O
security O
issues O

Besides O

there O
are O
security O
agreements O
between O
us O

Kuwait B-GPE
and O
the O
other O
Gulf B-LOC
states O
... O
we O
came O
at O
their O
request O
to O
protect O
them O
from O
your O
threats O
. O

Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
: O
Is O
n't O
funny O
that O
the O
wolf O
is O
being O
entrusted O
with O
the O
sheep O
? O

The O
people O
of O
Kuwait B-GPE
are O
an O
Arab B-NORP
people O

And O
Kuwait B-GPE
is O
Iraqi B-NORP
territory O

therefore O
I O
ask O
you O

carefully O

I O
am O

that O
you O

Before O

Rumsfeld B-PERSON

one B-CARDINAL
day O

Do O
you O

Saddam B-PERSON

: O
We O

our O

you O

you O
were O
looking O

any O

occupy O
Iraq B-GPE
and O
topple O
its O
legitimate O

Rumsfeld B-PERSON
: O
The O
Iraqis B-NORP
received O
us O
with O
overwhelming O
happiness O
and O
welcomed O
us O
, O
because O
of O
the O

Iraq B-GPE

you O

the O

of O
the O

Rumsfeld B-PERSON

Those O

something O

Saddam B-PERSON

Is O
n't O
this O
ridiculous O

Then O
, O
which O

Is O
it O
permissible O
for O
what O
you O
call O

be O
held O
under O
your O
occupation O
of O
our O
country O

Mr O
Rumsfeld B-PERSON
, O
we O
have O
learned O
from O
history O
that O
the O
occupier O
will O
not O
bring O
except O
his O
assistants O

lackeys O
, O
and O
you O
want O

, O
to O
convince O
me O

the O

Rumsfeld B-PERSON

The O
Iraqi B-NORP

If O

Death O

We O

no O
objection O

their O
arrival O

But O
more O

" O
terrorist O

If O

you O

Rumsfeld B-PERSON

Terrorism O

want O
you O
to O
think O
about O
it O
. O

We O
are O
currently O
re-evaluating O
our O
positions O
, O
we O
want O
to O
stop O
the O
bloodshed O
on O
both O
sides O
and O
so O
our O
offer O
is O
made O
from O
the O
point O
of O
strength O
and O
not O
from O
the O
point O
of O
weakness O
. O

We O
asked O
Jalal B-PERSON
Talabani I-PERSON
to O
make O
a O
statement O
in O
which O
he O
denies O
any O
intention O
to O
execute O
you O
as O
a O
sign O
of O
good O
will O
from O
us O
. O

We O
are O
ready O
to O
review O
our O
position O
completely O
on O
the O
entire O
political O
process O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
and O
we O
will O
hold O
a O
dialogue O
with O
you O
and O
with O
your O
men O
on O
this O
matter O
. O

Saddam B-PERSON
Hussain I-PERSON
: O
Are O
you O
ready O
to O
withdraw O
or O
not O
? O

Rumsfeld B-PERSON
: O
We O
could O
discuss O
re-deployment O
, O
our O
forces O
have O
prepared O
bases O
for O
long O
- O
term O
stay O
. O

We O
could O
withdraw O
from O
the O
streets O
and O
the O
towns O
but O
we O
will O
stay O
in O
the O
bases O
for O
a O
some O
time O
. O

Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
: O
Then O
you O
want O
a O
new O
lackey O
to O
be O
added O
to O
this O
queue O
of O
lackeys O
. O

No O
Mr. O
Rumsfeld B-PERSON
.. O
do O
n't O
forget O
that O
you O
are O
speaking O
with O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
, O
the O
president O
of O
the O
state O
of O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

Rumsfeld B-PERSON
: O
But O
you O
have O
lost O
power O
. O

Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
: O
I O
have O
only O
honor O
left O
and O
honor O
can O
not O
be O
sold O
or O
bought O
. O

Rumsfeld B-PERSON
: O
But O
life O
has O
a O
value O
that O
is O
priceless O
. O

Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
: O
There O
is O
no O
value O
to O
a O
life O
without O
honor O
, O
and O
you O
robbed O
Iraq B-GPE
of O
its O
honor O
when O
you O
desecrated O
its O
land O
. O

We O
will O
get O
our O
honor O
back O
whether O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
survives O
or O
becomes O
a O
martyr O
. O

Rumsfeld B-PERSON
: O
Your O
followers O
with O
whom O
we O
entered O
into O
a O
dialogue O
have O
told O
us O
that O
the O
decisions O
will O
be O
yours O
, O
first B-ORDINAL
and O
last B-ORDINAL
. O

Were O
they O
expecting O
your O
reaction O
? O

Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
: O
For O
sure O
, O
they O
know O
that O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussain I-PERSON
can O
not O
back O
down O
at O
the O
expense O
of O
his O
nation O
and O
its O
honor O
. O

Rumsfeld B-PERSON
: O
History O
will O
hold O
you O
responsible O
for O
the O
blood O
which O
is O
being O
spilled O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
: O
On O
the O
contrary O
, O
history O
will O
judge O
you O
because O
of O
your O
crimes O
.. O

I O
warned O
you O
in O
advance O
when O
I O
said O
to O
you O
that O
you O
will O
commit O
suicide O
on O
the O
walls O
of O
Baghdad B-GPE
, O
and O
here O
you O
are O
paying O
the O
price O
. O

I O
ask O
you O
to O
go O
to O
London B-GPE
and O
read O
the O
records O
of O
the B-ORG
British I-ORG
Foreign I-ORG
Office I-ORG
to O
find O
out O
some O
of O
the O
characteristics O
of O
the O
struggle O
of O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
people O
against O
your O
British B-NORP
friends O
whose O
mistakes O
you O
are O
repeating O
and O
making O
them O
participate O
with O
you O
. O

The O
Iraqi B-NORP
people O
are O
an O
obstinate O
people O
and O
do O
not O
fear O
death O
... O
the O
Resistance B-ORG
is O
stronger O
than O
you O
imagine O
and O
therefore O
I O
predict O
there O
'll O
be O
more O

Rumsfeld B-PERSON
: O
We O
have O
nothing O
to O
apologize O
for O
. O

You O
were O
a O
danger O
to O
your O
neighbors O
and O
tried O
to O
acquire O
weapons O
of O
mass O
destruction O
. O

And O
you O
practiced O
dictatorship O
over O
your O
people O
. O

and O
so O
it O
was O
natural O
that O
we O
extended O
our O
hand O
to O
the O
people O
of O
Iraq B-GPE
to O
rid O
them O
of O
the O
perils O
which O
had O
confronted O
them O
for O
more B-CARDINAL
than O
three O
decades O
. O

And O
did O
Rumsfeld B-PERSON
free O
Iraq B-GPE
from O
dangers O
? O

He O
is O
really O
delusional O
... O

I O
have O
reservations O
about O
what O
appeared O
in O
these O
minutes O
... O
because O
I O
think O
it O
unlikely O
that O
what O
happened O
at O
that O
meeting O
would O
leak O
out O
this O
easily O
... O

And O
I O
do O
not O
believe O
that O
Rumsfeld B-PERSON
would O
meet O
Saddam B-PERSON
unless O
Saddam B-PERSON
himself O
made O
signs O
... O
the O
important O
thing O
is O
that O
the O
expression O
quoted O
above O
tells O
of O
a O
reality O
that O
can O
not O
be O
but O
accepted O
... O

May O
God O
the O
Great O
forgive O
me O

Saddam B-PERSON
's O
last B-ORDINAL
days O
and O
what O
is O
said O
he O
was O
like O

Bu B-PERSON
Thari I-PERSON

What O
we O
know O
about O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
in O
recent B-DATE
years I-DATE
is O
that O
he O
had O
changed O
a O
lot O
. O

He O
had O
Islamic B-NORP
tendecies O
and O
acts O
which O
many O
Iraqis B-NORP
mentioned O
, O
saying O
that O
Saddam B-PERSON
supported O
to O
a O
great O
extent O
the O
building O
of O
mosques O
centers O
for O
memorizing O
Koran B-WORK_OF_ART
, O
and O
charities O
, O
and O
the O
dancer O
's O
punishment O
was O
death O
. O

He O
had O
many O
works O
. O

But O
some O
explained O
his O
Islamic B-PERSON
tendency O
by O
saying O
that O
he O
was O
currying O
favor O
with O
the O
Sunnis B-NORP
as O
if O
they O
were O
reading O
his O
mind O
. O

I O
have O
followed O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
, O
especially O
in O
recent B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
and O
I O
noticed O
about O
him O
was O
that O
there O
was O
religion O
but O
there O
was O
injustice O
and O
coarseness O
. O

And O
his O
punishment O
was O
unjust O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
for O
example O
, O
the O
dancer O
would O
be O
killed O
after O
second B-ORDINAL
offence O
. O

I O
did O
not O
expect O
anyone O
to O
kill O
the O
dancer O
unless O
good O
would O
come O
of O
it O
, O
but O
like O
the O
most O
idiots O
his O
aim O
was O
correct O
but O
the O
method O
was O
wrong O
. O

Another O
example O
- O
after O
his O
son O
Udai B-PERSON
harmed O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
people O
and O
attacked O
women O
and O
other O
matters O
, O
Saddam B-PERSON
ordered O
him O
to O
be O
killed O
. O

And O
in O
fact O
he O
was O
fired O
on O
but O
survived O
miraculously O
, O
after O
being O
hit O
with O
several O
fatal O
shots O
some O
of O
which O
hit O
his O
spine O
. O

This O
is O
a O
sign O
that O
there O
was O
good O
in O
him O
otherwise O
he O
would O
not O
have O
ordered O
the O
killing O
of O
his O
son O
, O
his O
own O
child O
. O

But O
he O
was O
not O
a O
scholar O
nor O
feared O
in O
God O
. O

I O
myself O
heard O
from O
some O
people O
who O
were O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
about O
the O
things O
that O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
used O
to O
do O
, O
and O
could O
not O
be O
reasonably O
done O
by O
anyone O
other O
than O
a O
good O
Moslem B-NORP
To O
the O
extent O
that O
many O
said O
of O
his O
actions O
that O
they O
were O
only O
to O
gain O
favor O
amongst O
the O
Sunnis B-NORP
and O
the O
religious O
. O

But O
we O
judge O
by O
the O
appearances O
and O
his O
end O
was O
in O
line O
with O
the O
appearance O
. O

In O
his O
last B-ORDINAL
days O
during O
the O
fall O
of O
Baghdad B-GPE
and O
his O
disappearance O
, O
an O
old O
woman O
or O
man O
said O
on O
TV O
on O
al B-ORG
- I-ORG
Jazeera I-ORG
channel O
that O
he O
was O
hiding O
in O
her O
house O
and O
had O
had O
his O
prayer O
mat O
with O
him O
and O
was O
always O
praying O
and O
reading O
the O
Koran B-WORK_OF_ART
. O

Do O
we O
say O
no O
, O
this O
is O
hypocrisy O
? O

Bear O
in O
mind O
that O
many O
have O
said O
that O
Saddam B-PERSON
prayed O
regularly O
especially O
after O
he O
was O
put O
in O
prison O
by O
the O
Rafida B-PERSON
and O
their O
masters O
. O

Some O
of O
those O
who O
said O
that O
he O
was O
always O
praying O
and O
reading O
the O
Koran B-WORK_OF_ART
are O
the O
Christians B-NORP
who O
visited O
him O
in O
his O
prison O
cell O
. O

Finally O
, O
during O
his O
hanging O
, O
the O
Rafida B-PERSON
tried O
to O
distract O
him O
and O
keep O
him O
from O
saying O
the O
Creed O
before O
his O
death O
. O

They O
were O
trying O
everything O
they O
could O
but O
we O
say O
that O
God O
made O
him O
steadfast O
for O
the O
whole O
world O
to O
see O
that O
he O
died O
acknowledging O
God O
. O

The O
Rafida B-PERSON
were O
shouting O
provocative O
words O
such O
as O
Muqtada B-PERSON
and O
al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Sadr I-PERSON
so O
that O
he O
would O
lose O
control O
and O
curse O
them O
, O
then O
they O
would O
have O
killed O
him O
. O

So O
they O
could O
show O
the O
clip O
in O
which O
there O
is O
cursing O
and O
insults O
from O
Saddam B-PERSON
and O
cut O
the O
rest O
. O

However O
he O
remained O
steadfast O
in O
saying O
the O
creed O
and O
was O
killed O
whilst O
saying O
it O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
this O
could O
n't O
have O
happened O
without O
God O
making O
him O
steadfast O
otherwise O
God O
would O
not O
have O
made O
him O
steadfast O
in O
it O
. O

As O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
sheikhs O
says O
, O
many O
people O
when O
they O
were O
supposed O
to O
say O
the O
creed O
and O
were O
being O
dictated O
the O
creed O
by O
those O
present O
would O
murmur O
" O
Did O
love O
see O
drunkards O
? O
" O

Other O
people O
say O
, O
I O
have O
not O
said O
it O
while O
I O
was O
alive O
and O
you O
want O
me O
to O
say O
it O
when O
I O
am O
dying O
... O
the O
truth O
is O
what O
is O
apparent O
. O

But O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
was O
reasonable O
in O
that O
he O
repented O
and O
turned O
to O
his O
creator O
who O
receives O
the O
repentance O
from O
his O
slave O
. O

And O
he O
committed O
himself O
to O
the O
worship O
of O
God O
. O
And O
remained O
loyal O
to O
God O
. O

I O
ask O
God O
to O
have O
mercy O
on O
him O
and O
to O
forgive O
him O
and O
to O
give O
him O
an O
ample O
dwelling O
in O
his O
paradise O
and O
guide O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
Ba'thists B-NORP
. O
