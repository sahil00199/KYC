Pampers B-PRODUCT

This O

I O
mean O
you O
lay O
her O
down O
on O
the O
bed O

she O
gets O
up O

and O
she O
runs O
from O
, O

well O
she O
does O
n't O
run O

but O
she O
crawls O
real O
fast O
. O

And O
she O
has O
t- O
aw O

And O
you O
're O
like O
okay O
. O

And O
she O
's O
not O
a O
cuddly O
sweet O
little O
thing O
, O

she O
, O

and O
she O
climbs O
up O
the O
stairs O
, O
Selema B-PERSON
. O

She O
's O
seven B-DATE
months I-DATE
old I-DATE

and O
she O
's O
climbing O
up O
the O
stairs O
. O

Climbs O
down O
the O
stairs O

and O
mom O
said O
so O
we O
found O
out O
, O

when O
did O
we O
find O
out O
Barbara B-PERSON
was O
pregnant O
? O

Last B-DATE
week I-DATE
, O
we O
found O
out O

and O
mom O
told O
her O

mom O
said O
, O
Barbara B-PERSON
, O
Jasmine B-PERSON
is O
just O
moving O

she O
's O
moving O
out O
the O
way O
too O
quickly O

she O
just O
was O
not O
a O
little O
sweet O
little O
cuddly O
you O
know O
, O

no O
way O

%uh O
lay O
there O
let O
me O
look O
at O
my O
grandmother O
kind O
of O
thing O

No O
no O
way O

not O
one O
bit O
. O

oh O
oh O
Amway B-ORG
is O
probably O
going O
to O
have O
a O
rule O
though O
I O
could O
just O

But O
%uh O
, O
yeah O
, O

it O
's O
still O
a O
fairly O
expensive O
call O

%uh O
but O
it O
's O
a O
lot O
less O
expensive O
if O
we O
do O
it O
that O
way O
than O
if O
we O
actually O
make O
my O
parents O
in O
law O
pay O
it O
, O

then O
it O

the O
Dutch B-NORP
have O
such O
high O
taxes O
on O
those O

they O
consider O
it O
a O
luxury O
to O
call O
around O
the O
world O

so O
they O
tax O
it O
really O
high O
. O

Anyway O
%um O

So O
you O
guys O
will O
be O
in O
either O
the B-DATE
eighteenth I-DATE
or O
the B-DATE
nineteenth I-DATE

and O
you O
're O
going O
to O
go O
to O
%uh O
Amsterdam B-GPE
. O

Well O
I O
would O
say O
is O
once O
you O
're O
at O
a O
hotel O
uh-huh O
%um O
, O
why O
do O
n't O
you O
call O
me O
at O
work O
and O
let O
me O
know O
where O
you O
are O
, O

and O
then O
we O
can O
make O
arrangements O
that O
day O
%um O
, O
that O
I O
can O
meet O
you O
in O
Amsterdam B-GPE
. O

And O
maybe O
I O
'll O
come O
by O
, O
public O
transport O
. O

It O
's O
probably O
easier O
for O
me O
to O
come O
by O
public O
transport O
in O
Amsterdam B-GPE
than O
it O
is O
for O
me O
to O
come O
by O
car O
to O
be O
honest O
. O

mhm O
. O

The O
streets O
are O
small O

and O
there O
's O
no O
parking O
. O

So O
I O
probably O
will O
come O
by O
public O
transport O

but O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

We O
'll O
see O
where O
you O
're O
staying O

%um O

and O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
more O
for O
you O
guys O
if O
you O
want O
to O
see O
stuff O

you O
can O
see O
stuff O
in O
Amsterdam B-GPE

and O
%uh O
since O
the O
days O
are O
really O
long O
, O

I O
mean O
it O
stays O
light O
here O
till O
about O
ten B-TIME
thirty I-TIME
eleven B-TIME
o'clock I-TIME
mhm O
. O
at B-TIME
night I-TIME
. O

So O
if O
you O
want O
we O
can O
take O
a O
ride O
and O
go O
see O
stuff O
at B-TIME
night I-TIME

and O
I O
can O
take O
you O
to O
some O
places O
, O

we O
can O
%uh O
go O
see O
some O
stuff O
. O

%um O
, O
depends O
on O
what O
you O
guys O
want O
to O
see O
. O

So O
you O
guys O
should O
pick O
out O
the O
things O
you O
want O
to O
see O
and O
let O
me O
know O
. O

okay O

%um O
and O
I O
'll O
sit O
and O
talk O
with O
Anya B-PERSON
about O
some O
things O
that O
maybe O
we O
think O
that O
it O
would O
be O
neat O
for O
you O
to O
see O
. O

So O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
any O
ideas O
we O
'll O
just O
put O
something O
together O
for O
you O
. O

okay O
. O

%um O
but O
yeah O

but O
I O
can O
pick O
you O
up O
th- O
, O

you O
know O
I O
'll O
probably O
be O
there O
some O
time O
around B-TIME
six I-TIME

and O
we O
can O
like O
do O
a O
quick O
dinner O
or O
something O
yeah O
and O
go O
see O
whatever O
you O
want O
to O
see O
, O

if O
you O
want O
to O
stay O
in O
Amsterdam B-GPE
that O
's O
fine O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
go O
%uh O
off O
into O
the O
countryside O
somewhere O
and O
see O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
, O
echte O
Holland B-GPE
, O
real O
Holland B-GPE
and O
we O
can O
do O
that O
too O
. O

Actually O
I O
've O
been O
up O
to O
Holland B-GPE
before O
. O

Spent O
about B-DATE
two I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
up O
there O
. O

yeah O
. O

So O
%um O
, O

but O
that O
was O
years B-DATE
and I-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
. O

With O
your O
parents O
when O
your O
father O
was O
stationed O
over O
here O
, O
right O
? O

yeah O
. O

But O
we O
got O
to O
see O
Den B-GPE
Haag I-GPE
and O
places O
like O
that O
too O
which O
we O
're O
obviously O
not O
going O
to O
see O
this O
time O
. O

But O
%um O

has O
Kim B-PERSON
been O
here O
before O
? O

And O
, O
an- O

No O
. O

oh O
good O
. O

But O
then O
again O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
that O
Kim B-PERSON
would O
be O
interested O
in O
seeing O
Shape B-FAC
Headquarters I-FAC
and O
you O
know O
all O
that O
kind O
of O
stuff O
. O
those O
military O
things O
. O

Would O
you O
be O
interested O
in O
seeing O
Shape B-FAC
Headquarters I-FAC
again O
. O

No O
. O
Not O
really O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
think O
so O
. O

Somehow O
I O
had O
this O
feeling O
that O
the O
military O
taste O
had O
been O
beaten O
out O
of O
you O
. O

yep O
. O

I O
'm O
, O

the O
mil- O
, O

I O
ca O
n't O
say O
too O
bad O
things O
about O
the O
military O
though O
. O

They O
still O
have O
my O
goods O

and O
they O
'll O
probably O
hold O
them O
hostage O
. O

And O
they O
own O
my O
body O
and O
soul O
for O
like O
another B-DATE
four I-DATE
years I-DATE

so O
I O
just O
got O
to O
pray O
that O
they O

oh O
do O
they O
? O

yeah O
. O

I O
owe O
four B-DATE
years I-DATE
in O
active O
reserve O
time O
. O

aw O
great O
. O

Do O
they O
do O
that O
to O
everyone O
? O

Milo O
, O
get O
out O
of O
there O

yeah O
-- O
-- O
%eh O
everyone O
%uh O
who O
has O
n't O
been O
like O
you O
were O

you O
went O
through O
like O
the O
thirty B-CARDINAL
six I-CARDINAL
two B-CARDINAL
process O
. O

mhm O
. O

So O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
it O

but O
yeah O
if O
you O
just O
separate O
normally O
and O
you O
have O
n't O
served O
at B-DATE
least I-DATE
eight I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
then O
you O
owe O
it O
. O

And O
that O
's O
one O
of O
those O
things O
they O
just O
never O
tell O
you O
up O
front O
. O

No O
. O

They O
never O
said O
anything O

I O
figured O
there O
was O
something O
like O
that O
because O

And O
I O
was O
in O
the O
inactive O
reserves O
the O
entire O
time O
I O
was O
in O
college O
too O
. O

So O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
mean O
that O
's O
the O
military O
. O

I O
have O
my O
discharge O
papers O
and O
everything O

uh-huh O
. O

and O
I O
've O
said O
that O
yeah O
I O
will O
give O
a O
urine O
sample O
or O
a O
blood O
sample O
if O
they O
call O
me O
back O
for O
those O
, O
but O
they O
're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
pay O
my O
trip O
back O
to O
the B-GPE
states I-GPE
. O
because O
there O
's O
no O
bases O
in O
Holland B-GPE
and O
I O
'm O
not O
going O
to O
pay O
out O
of O
my O
own O
expenses O
to O
go O
to O
Germany B-GPE
or O
something O
for O
them O
. O

If O
they O
want O
me O
they O
can O
pay O
, O

bring O
me O
back O
active O
duty O
and O
pay O
me O
for O
the O
day O
if O
they O
're O
going O
to O
drag O
me O
off O
somewhere O
. O

But O
%uh O
, O
first B-ORDINAL
they O
have O
to O
find O
me O
. O

yeah O
, O
that O
's O
the O
other O

it O
was O
i- O
, O

if O
you O
're O
in O
another O
country O
I O
mean O
and O
you O
're O
not O
planning O
on O
coming O
back O
to O
the B-GPE
U I-GPE
S I-GPE
what O
are O
they O
going O
to O
do O
even O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
. O

yeah O
. O

Well O
I O
mean O
I O
'm O
still O
American B-NORP
citizen O

and O
I O
still O
would O
like O
to O
be O
welcome O
in O
my O
own O
country O
. O

Although O
g- O

%uh O
I O
mean O
if O
they O
denied O
my O
citizenship O
and O
I O
became O
a O
citizen O
here O
I O
probably O
would O
n't O
be O
a O
horror O
either O
, O

but O
%uh O
yeah O

right O
now O
I O
mean O
I O
do O
want O
to O
keep O
my O
American B-NORP
citizenship O

so O
. O

I O
kind O
of O
want O
to O

Are O
you O
going O
to O
become O
a O
dual O
citizen O
? O

What O
's O
that O
? O

Are O
you O
going O
to O
try O
and O
become O
a O
dual O
citizen O
? O

Have O
dual O
citizenship O
? O

You O
ca O
n't O
do O
that O
, O

%um O
, O
the O
only O
way O
to O
be O
a O
dual O
citizen O
is O
if O
you O
're O
born O
in O
a O
foreign O
country O

like O
if O
I O
were O
born O
in O
Holland B-GPE
and O
then O
had O
American B-NORP
parents O
. O
Then O
I O
could O
be O
a O
dual O
citizen O
. O

But O
you O
ca O
n't O

If O
I O
would O
to O
ask O
to O
become O
a O
citizen O
in O
Holland B-GPE
I O
would O
automatically O
lose O
my O
American B-NORP
citizenship O
. O

As O
far O
as O
the O
Americans B-NORP
are O
concerned O
, O
yeah O
. O

yeah O
. O

The O
Dutch B-NORP
could O
care O
less O
. O

The O
Dutch B-NORP
would O
say O
fine O

want O
to O
be O
a O
dual O
citizen O
, O

that O
's O
fine O
, O

but O
the O
Americans B-NORP
as O
soon O
as O
you O
ask O
for O
another O
citizenship O
that O
act O
of O
asking O
for O
it O
takes O
away O
your O
American B-NORP
citizenship O
. O

I O
mean O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
stupid O
. O

yeah O
. O

So O
I O
'm O
an O
expatriot O
. O

An O
American B-NORP
expatriot O
. O

An O
American B-NORP
living O
abroad O
. O

I O
still O
have O
to O
file O
a O
tax O
return O
. O

Do O
you O
? O

yeah O
. O

But O
my O
first B-ORDINAL
seventy B-MONEY
five I-MONEY
thousand I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
worth O
of O
income O
is O
tax O
free O
. O

Good O
grief O
. O

As O
long O
as O
I O
do O
n't O
bring O
it O
back O
to O
the O
states O
. O

Good O
grief O
. O

I B-ORG
R I-ORG
S I-ORG
for O
you O
, O
%huh O
? O

yeah O
. O

oh O
they O
want O
their O
share O
. O

They O
want O
their O
piece O
of O
meat O
. O

But O
all O
foreign O
taxes O
are O
deductible O
, O

and O
my O
taxes O
here O
are O
fifty B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
of O
income O
. O

So O
the O
taxes O
here O
are O
so O
much O
higher O
that O
, O
yeah O
I O
would O
never O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
it O
. O

Unless O
you O
became O
C O
E O
O O
of O
the O
company O
then O
maybe O
like O
a B-MONEY
thousand I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
would O
be O
taxable O
, O
right O
? O

yeah O
. O

Somehow O
it O
raises O
a O
small O
amount O
. O

the O
problem O
's O
going O
to O
%uh O
be O
Anya B-PERSON
's O
American B-NORP
salary O
is O
taxable O
here O
and O
at O
fifty B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT

so O
we O
're O
going O
to O
owe O
some O
money O
to O
the B-ORG
Dutch I-ORG
government I-ORG
on O
her O
salary O
. O

aw O
. O

Some O
amount O
that O
has O
to O
be O
deducted O
a O
certain O
amount O

and O
the O
amount O
we O
pay O
the B-ORG
American I-ORG
government I-ORG
is O
deductible O
, O

but O
we O
'll O
still O
owe O
some O
taxes O
. O

Th- O
, O

see O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
it O
works O
. O

we O
're O
going O
to O
be O
in O
need O
of O
some O
sort O
of O
accountant O
do O
it O
cause O
I O
have O
no O
clue O
how O
that O
all O
works O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
have O
the O
Quicken B-PRODUCT
Dutch B-LANGUAGE
version O
? O

yeah O
. O

%ah O
, O
you O
know O
I O
would O
n't O
trust O
it O
because O
it O
's O
so O
complicated O
with O
this O
international O
garbage O
or O
else O
the B-PRODUCT
Turbo I-PRODUCT
Tax I-PRODUCT
with O
the O
Dutch B-LANGUAGE
modules O
. O
that O
I O
just O
would O
n't O
trust O
it O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
%eh O
. O

yeah O
. O

So O
complicated O
when O
you O
're O
dealing O
with O
a O
Dutch B-LANGUAGE
tax O
form O
. O

Anya B-PERSON
had O
to O
read O
it O

and O
Anya B-PERSON
and O
her O
father O
did O
n't O
understand O
the O
damn O
thing O
. O

How O
am O
I O
supposed O
to O
understand O
it O
? O

I O
'm O
really O
looking O
forward O
to O
moving O
to O
Oregon B-GPE
and O
dealing O
with O
, O

Oregon B-GPE
you O
pay O
state O
tax O

Washington B-GPE
you O
do O
n't O
. O

I O
'm O
looking O
forward O
to O
that O
cause O
%uh O

yeah O

but O
You O
'll O
be O
a O
student O

so O
you O
, O

I O
mean O
you O
're O

what O
is O
your O
income O
? O

oh O
, O
well O

See O
I O
think O
y- O
, O
%um O
, O

it O
'll O
probably O
be O
about B-MONEY
five I-MONEY
thousand I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
the B-DATE
portion I-DATE
of I-DATE
this I-DATE
year I-DATE
that O
I O
'm O
in O
Oregon B-GPE

and O
then O
next B-DATE
year I-DATE
it O
'll O
be O
eleven B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
. O

yeah O
. O

But O
I O
mean O
you O
're O
below O
the O
poverty O
line O
at O
that O
level O
. O

yeah O
. O

So O
I O
mean O
any O
income O
that O
y- O

Well O

But O
then O
I O
've O
already O
made O
say O
like B-CARDINAL
fifteen I-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
or O
whatever O
here O
in O
Washington B-GPE

but O

That O
should O
be O
non O
taxable O
out O
of O
state O
income O
. O

It O
should O

but O
you O
know O
it O
's O
not O
going O
to O
be O
a O
fun O
tax O
return O
year B-DATE
. O

I O
had O
that O
when O
I O
went O
into O
the O
military O
. O

But O
then O
again O
. O

I O
had O
Kans- O
, O

I O
had O
to O
file O
three B-CARDINAL
taxes O
. O

I O
had O
to O
file O
Georgia B-GPE

well O
. O

It O

really O
crowded O
today B-DATE
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
kind O
of O
assumed O
everyone O
would O
be O
at O
the O
shore O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

I O
was O
wrong O
. O

Well O
it O
's O
the B-DATE
middle I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
week I-DATE
or O
whatever O

so O
. O

But O
it O
's O
the B-DATE
fourth I-DATE
of I-DATE
July I-DATE
. O

%mm O
. O

So O
. O

yeah O
. O

People O

. O

Do O
you O
have O
to O
work O
tomorrow B-DATE
? O

yeah O
. O

Did O
you O
have O
off O
yesterday B-DATE
? O

Yes O
. O

oh O
that O
's O
good O
. O

And O
I O
was O
paid O
too O
. O

oh O
. O

Is O
it O
paid O
today B-DATE
? O

No O
. O

oh O
. O

But O
%uh O

yeah O
, O

so O
the O
gym O
's O
going O
well O
. O

oh O
. O

But O
I O
still O
need O
to O
go O
more O
often O
. O

Well O
how O
often O
are O
you O
going O
? O

Only O
four O
days O
a O
week O
. O

. O

yeah O
. O

Got O
to O
get O
that O
up O
to O
five B-CARDINAL
. O

%mm O
. O

But O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
really O
like O
going O
with O
Anne B-PERSON
Marie I-PERSON
because O
she O
does O
n't O
like O
to O
stay O
very O
long O
. O

Why O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

She O
kind O
of O
, O

well O
unfortunately O
for O
some O
reason O
she O
's O
not O
like O
into O
cardio O
vascular O
. O

So O
when O
I O
'm O
still O
riding O
the O
bike O
she O
's O
completely O
finished O
her O
weight O
lifting O
routine O
. O

mhm O
. O

And O
like O
I O
have O
n't O
even O
started O
mine O
. O
mhm O
. O
You O
know O

and O
I O
kind O
of O
hinted O
to O
her O
that O
really O
the O
only O
way O
to O
lose O
weight O
is O
cardio O
vascular O
. O
mhm O
. O
It O
's O
true O
. O
And O
that O
lifting O
the O
weights O
wo O
n't O
lose O
weight O
. O

%mm O
%mm O
. O

You O
wo O
n't O
lose O
it O
, O
you O
know O
, O

but O

No O

I O
mean O
you O
might O
lose O
some O

but O
that O
's O
only O
when O
yo- O
. O

For O
a O
woman O
who O
is O
lifting O
not O
that O
much O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
yeah O
. O
You O
would O
. O

I O
mean O
yeah O

I O
mean O
the O
only O
thing O
is O
%um O
just O
getting O
your O
heart O
rate O
up O
for O
extended O
periods O
of O
time O
. O

yeah O
, O

So O
I O
do O
n't O
know O

maybe O
she O
'll O
catch O
on O
soon O
. O

You O
do O
burn O
a O
lot O
of O
calories O
an O
hour O
though O
, O
lifting O
weights O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

But O
%uh O

yeah O

I O
mean O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
you O
're O
going O
to O
lose O
that O
much O
. O

and O
also O
lifting O
weights O
at O
Bally B-FAC
's I-FAC
means O
you O
're O
standing O
on O
line O
for O
as O
much O
time O
as O
you O
're O
actually O
lifting O
. O

Really O
. O

yeah O
. O

That O
's O
too O
bad O
. O

yeah O
. O

So O
is O
it O
really O
overcrowded O
? O

Well O
, O
I O
mean O
obviously O
since O
I O
work O
I O
ca O
n't O
get O
there O
until O
about B-TIME
six I-TIME
o'clock I-TIME
at O
night O
which O
is O
when O
everyone O
else O
gets O
there O
. O

mhm O
. O

mhm O
. O

But O
I O
'm O
sure O
for O
people O
who O
go O
in O
the B-TIME
daytime I-TIME
it O
's O
probably O
dead O
. O
yeah O
. O
You O
know O

and O
%um O
, O
like O
when O
I O
go O
Saturday B-TIME
and I-TIME
Sunday I-TIME
mornings I-TIME
it O
's O
totally O
dead O
. O

mhm O
. O

So O

But O
you O
know O
the B-TIME
weeknights I-TIME
is O
pretty O
crazy O
. O

yeah O
. O

yeah O

I O
found O
a O
gym O
yesterday B-DATE
here O
that O
's O
only O
eight B-MONEY
pounds I-MONEY
a O
month O
which O
is O
like O
twelve B-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
, O
twelve B-CARDINAL
fifty B-CARDINAL

oh O
yeah O
. O

Wow O
. O

yeah O
. O

It O
's O
at O
the O
hospital O
nearby O
. O

Well O
that O
's O
a O
deal O
. O

yeah O
. O

yeah O
. O

So O
uh-huh O
. O
I O
think O
%um O
tonight B-TIME
Charlie B-PERSON
and O
I O
are O
going O
to O
go O
over O
and O
join O
up O
. O

Even O
Charlie B-PERSON
's O
going O
to O
join O
? O

No O
, O

but O
it O
has O
to O
be O
debited O
from O
a O
bank O
account O
so O
it O
's O
got O
to O
be O
debited O
from O
his O
. O

yeah O
. O

In O
your O
letter O
you O
said O
that O
he O
eats O
constantly O
. O

oh O
my O
god O
. O

Really O
? O

Alice B-PERSON
, O
I O
've O
never O
seen O
anybody O
eat O
as O
much O
as O
he O
does O

and O
he O
's O
so O
skinny O
. O

mhm O
. O

I O
mean O
the O
amount O
of O
cereal O
he O
eats O
like O
between O
meals O
and O
after O
meals O

yeah O
. O

and O
we O
go O
through O
a O
box O
of O
cereal O
every B-DATE
two I-DATE
days I-DATE
. O

Really O
? O

yeah O
. O

Wow O
. O

He O
eats O
at O
least O
like O
four B-CARDINAL
of O
cereal O
a O
day O
like O
in O
addition O
to O
like O
meals O
. O

uh-huh O

And O
when O
he O
goes O
to O
work O
he O
brings O
four B-CARDINAL
sandwiches O
with O
him O
, O
uh-huh O
. O
a O
bag O
of O
potato O
chips O
uh-huh O
. O
%um O
you O
know O
and O
then O
little O
sweetie O
things O
chocolates O
and O
**cakies** O
and O
stuff O
like O
that O
. O

uh-huh O

And O
then O
you O
know O
before O
he O
leaves O
every O
morning O
he O
has O
like O
two B-CARDINAL
fried O
eggs O
mhm O
on O
toast O
with O
cheese O
%um O
vegetarian O
sausages O
%um O
and O
like O
fruit O

and O
oh O
my O
god O
it O
's O
just O
crazy O
. O

mhm O
. O

It O
's O
crazy O
how O
much O
he O
eats O
. O

He O
was O
probably O
starving O
when O
he O
was O
here O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
think O
what O
we O
got O
to O
do O
is O
just O
when O
he O
comes O
just O
have O
lots O
of O
cereal O
. O

He O
likes O
Cocoa B-PRODUCT
Pops I-PRODUCT
. O

oh O
boy O
. O

Wow O
. O

That O
's O
pretty O
crazy O
. O

yeah O
. O

It O
's O
all O
about O
being O
a O
blue O
collar O
man O
. O

I O
guess O
so O
. O

They O
're O
the O
ones O
who O
can O
eat O
all B-TIME
day I-TIME
. O

Really O
? O

Well O
I O
mean O
he O
does O
work O
his O
ass O
off O

so O

yeah O
. O

But O
%uh O
291.01_291.28_B: O
%hm O
. O

%hm O
. O

So O
, O
I O
assume O
it O
's O
hard O
for O
you O
not O
to O
eat O
as O
much O
as O
he O
does O
. O

No O
. O

I O
learned O
quick O
fast O
in O
a O
hurry O
because O
I O
've O
gained O
so O
much O
weight O
. O

oh O
really O
? O

yeah O
. O

Actually O
in O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
week I-DATE
I O
was O
here O
-- O
mhm O
. O
-- O
I O
gained O
a O
lot O

so O
. O

Well O
it O
's O
hard O
to O
you O
know O
not O
eat O
when O
somebody O
else O
is O
eating O
. O

Well O
I O
'm O
figuring O
it O
out O
fast O
because O
-- O
okay O
-- O
with O
not O
working O
out O
and O
all O
yeah O
. O
it O
's O
pretty O
miserable O
my O
crunch O
tape O
. O

%mm O
. O

So O
I O
called O
this O
woman O
today B-DATE

and O
%um O
, O
she O
's O
a O
dressmaker O

and O
we O
're O
going O
to O
go O
see O
her O
next B-DATE
Thursday I-DATE
and O
talk O
about O
her O
making O
my O
wedding O
dress O
. O

Slate O
green O
. O

yeah O
. O

%uh O
. O

See O
, O
that O
way O
I O
can O
have O
exactly O
what O
I O
want O
. O

Exactly O
. O

And O
it O
's O
only O
going O
to O
be O
about B-MONEY
two I-MONEY
hundred I-MONEY
and I-MONEY
fifty I-MONEY
pounds I-MONEY
which O
is O
about B-MONEY
three I-MONEY
hundred I-MONEY
and I-MONEY
fifty I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
. O

uh-huh O

pretty O
good O
I O
mean O
comparatively O
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
it O
'll O
be O
exactly O
what O

'll O
look O
good O
on O
me O
, O
you O
know O
like O
fit O
me O

Sure O
. O
which O
is O
necessary O
at O
the O
moment O
because O
I O
'm O
plump O

so O
. O

mhm O
. O

Now O

to O
go O

and O
she O
got O
mad O
. O

Really O
? O

Well O
I O
said O
I O
would O
not O
feel O
comfortable O
going O
. O

I O
was O
not O
invited O
. O
mhm O
. O
You O
know O

and O
mom O
and O
dad O
were O
like O
well O
you O
know O
a O
wedding O
that O
's O
a O
mass O
is O
open O
to O
everyone O
. O

I O
was O
like O
well O
that O
's O
fine O

but O
I O
would O
not O
feel O
comfortable O
going O
. O

mhm O
. O

I O
think O
that O
would O
be O
obnoxious O

and O
I O
think O
they O
would O
then O
feel O
guilty O
for O
not O
inviting O
me O
. O

Right O
. O

To O
-- O
-- O
you O
know O
the O
other O
thing O
, O
the O
reception O
. O

I O
just O
would O
n't O
go O
. O

%mm O
. O

So O
they O
had O
to O
take O
it O
down O
and O
drive O
her O
home O
. O

%mm O
. O

So O
they O
're O
always O
kind O
of O
pissy O
at O
me O
. O

%mm O
. O
That O
's O
okay O
. O

yeah O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
mean O
I O
've O
been O
thinking O
about O
it O

and O
the O
black O
's O
not O
going O
to O
be O
so O
hot O
you O
know O

but O

mhm O
. O

yeah O
. O

Apparently O
they O
were O
also O
carrying O
lillies O
which O
is O
kind O
of O
goofy O
. O

yeah O
. O

Well O
I O
guess O
she O
did O
that O
because O
someone O
suggested O
that O
to O
her O
because O
you O
know O
the O
lillies O
the O
symbol O
of O
the O
virgin O
Mary B-PERSON
. O

mhm O
. O

White O
lillies O
? O

White O
lillies O
and O
black O
dresses O
. O

%mm O
, O
my O
goodness O
. O

That O
's O
funny O
. O

yeah O
. O

yeah O
. O

Adele B-PERSON
was O
carrying O
on O
that O
she O
thought O
she O
was O
at O
a O
funeral O

and O
she O
had O
to O
keep O
reminding O
herself O
. O

%mm O
. O

So O
now O
you O
think O
my O
wedding O
's O
going O
to O
be O
pretty O
tasteful O
right O
? O

But O

oh O
yeah O
. O

Now O
what O
about O
the O
matchbooks O
? O

Well O
I O
'll O
work O
on O
it O
. O

I O
still O
think O
about O
the O
matchbooks O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
'll O
tell O
dad O
that O
you O
still O
think O
about O
the O

I O
have O
n't O
forgotten O
those O

and O
they O
'll O
still O
be O
enough O
time O
when O
I O
come O
home O
for O
me O
to O
order O
those O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
'll O
have O
remind O
him O
of O
that O
little O
-- O
-- O
item O
. O

yeah O
. O

%huh O
how O
fun- O
. O

You O
know O
I O
was O
talking O
to O
my O
friend O
Heather B-PERSON
from O
Wisconsin B-GPE
the O
other O
day O
-- O

-- O
and O
she O
's O
telling O
me O
about O
you O
know O
her O
sister O
's O
wedding O
. O

And O
at O
her O
sister O
's O
wedding O
%uh O
, O
they O
provided O
champagne O
and O
beer O
. O

But O
if O
you O
wanted O
any O
other O
kind O
of O
drink O
you O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
. O

mhm O
. O

yeah O
. O

that O
's O
actually O
kind O
of O
common O

but O
-- O
oh O
it O
is O
. O
it O
's O
pretty O
de O
classe O
. O

Well O
I O
kind O
of O
thou- O
, O

I O
mean O
of O
course O
I O
did O
n't O
say O
anything O
to O
her O
. O

yeah O
. O

You O
know O
I O
said O
as O
far O
as O
I O
knew O
we O
were O
n't O
charging O
people O
. O

yeah O
. O

Now O

But O
%uh O
, O

yeah O

Dad O
and O
I O
went O
to O
buy O
the O
wine O
the O
other O
day O
. O

And O
there O
were O
having O
a O
sale O
on O
the O
wine O
dad O
wanted O
. O

Are O
you O
talking O
to O
me O
? O

Of O
course O
I O
'm O
talking O
to O
you O
. O

I O
can O
hardly O
hear O
you O
. O

oh O
. O

I O
thought O
you O
were O
talking O
to O
somebody O
else O
and O
like O
put O
the O
phone O
down O
or O
something O
. O

I O
'm O
talking O
to O
you O
. O

oh O
. O

yeah O
. O

No O
dad O
told O
me O
that O
. O

oh O
he O
did O
tell O
you O
. O

It O
's O
all O
Chilean B-NORP
. O

yeah O
. O

yeah O
. O

Walnut B-ORG
Crest I-ORG
or O
Walnut B-ORG
Creek I-ORG
or O
-- O
%mm O
. O
-- O
something O
like O
that O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

%mm O
. O

There O
's O
a O
pretty O
good O
sale O
. O
%mm O
. O
So O
now O
we O
have O
to O
keep O
our O
eyes O
open O
for O
a O
champagne O
sale O
. O

An- O
, O

do O
you O
know O
if O
Jack B-PERSON
called O
Spencer B-PERSON
yet O
? O

I O
told O
him O
this B-TIME
morning I-TIME
to O
do O
it O
this O
week O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

And O
he O
just O
keeps O
forgetting O
. O

yeah O
. O

But O
o- O

How O
's O
he O
doing O
? O

Much O
better O
. O

yeah O
? O

yeah O
. O

he O
's O
often O
chipper O
. O

He O
went O
for O
a O
walk O
this B-TIME
morning I-TIME
at I-TIME
five I-TIME
seventeen I-TIME
. O

Pe- O

oh O
my O
god O
. O

Is O
that O
because O
he O
's O
not O
sleeping O
and O

Well O
because O
he O
could O
n't O
breathe O
because O
all O
the O
cats O
were O
in O
the O
bedroom O
. O

oh O
. O

So O
I O
think O
it O
's O
time O
to O
give O
all O
the O
cats O
a O
bath O
. O

%mm O
. O

yeah O

and O
the- O
, O

you O
should O
do O
that O
. O

I O
know O
. O

It O
's O
a O
two B-CARDINAL
person O
job O
though O
. O

I O
'll O
have O
to O
get O
somebody O
to O
help O
me O
. O

%mm O
. O
yeah O
. O

%hm O
. O

So O
, O
anyway O
, O
how O
are O
you O
doing O
these O
days O
? O

Things O
are O
going O
very O
well O
. O

I O
think O
I O
had O
mentioned O
before O
%uh O
, O
that O
there O
's O
a O
company O
now O
that O
I O
'm O
working O
with O
%um O
, O
%uh O
, O
which O
is O
very O
much O
just O
myself O
and O
Guss B-PERSON
. O

oh O
. O

And O
that O
%um O

No O
, O
you O
had O
n't O
mentioned O
that O
. O

%eh O
, O
oh O
, O
okay O
. O

okay O
, O
so O
%um O

%eh O
you O
told O
me O
that O
you O
were O
leaving O
the O
company O
that O
you O
were O
at O
, O

and O
you O
were O
entertaining O
offers O
. O

And O
, O
%uh O

well O
it O
seemed O
to O
make O
sense O
since O
I O
had O
a O
client O
to O
just O
kind O
of O
set O
up O
my O
own O
company O
, O
of O
sorts O
. O

%um O
oh O
. O
So O
things O
are O
going O
extremely O
well O
. O

So O
, O
I O
had O
one O
client O
who O
said O
that O
he O
'd O
pay O
me O
a O
minimum O
amount O
. O

You O
know O
, O
he O
, O
%uh O
, O

there O
would O
be O
a O
minimum O
amount O
of O
work O
, O
of O
about O
%uh O
, O
a O
day O
a O
week O
for O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
two I-DATE
three I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O
mhm O
. O
Which O
is O
sufficient O
to O
pay O
all O
my O
bills O
then O

so O
I O
decided O
that O
it O
would O
make O
sense O
to O
do O
this O
. O

%um O
and O
, O
%um O
, O
I O
've O
been O
getting O
substantially O
more O
work O
than O
then O
. O

%mm O
. O

So O
I O
'm O
quite O
pleased O
. O

Well O
that O
's O
good O
. O

%um O
, O
so O
I O
have O
a O
bunch O
of O
%uh O
work O
that O
I O
need O
to O
do O
on O
my O
flat O
this B-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

I O
've O
been O
telling O
you O
that O
I O
needed O
to O
do O
that O
roof O
atrium O
for O
quite O
some O
time O
. O

But O
, O
%uh O
, O
it O
should O
come O
out O
this B-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

oh O
, O
well O
that O
's O
good O
. O

It O
should O
be O
done O
in O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
months I-DATE
. O

oh O
, O
yeah O

I O
remember O
So O
you O
talking O
a O
little O
bit O
about O
it O
at O
one O
point O
. O

yeah O
, O

yeah O
. O

So O
you O
have O
no O
intentions O
of O
coming O
over O
this O
way O
any O
time O
soon O
? O

%um O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
see O
the O
finances O
occurring O
uh-huh O
, O
right O
. O
for O
a O
while O
. O

%um O
, O
actually O
right O
at O
the O
moment O
finances O
are O
not O
going O
real O
well O
. O

But O
%ah O
well O
. O
I O
am O
working O
on O
that O
one O
. O

%uh O
. O

It O
's O
just O
But O
%um O
%uh O
, O
%uh O
, O
the O
main O
reason O
for O
that O
is O
I O
had O
not O
really O
anticipated O
a O
few O
expenses O
that O
recently O
came O
up O
%ah O
. O
%uh O
, O
related O
to O
a O
couple O
of O
burglaries O
that O
I O
had O
. O

oh O
, O
harsh O
. O
Harsh O
. O

yeah O
. O

yeah O
, O

and O
. O

Not O
a O
whole O
lot O
I O
can O
do O
about O
that O
now O
. O

Indeed O
. O
Indeed O
. O

have O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
situation O
. O

And O

So O
that O
's O
what O
I O
'm O
doing O
. O

Sounds O
good O
. O

But O
%um O
Anyway O
, O
%uh O
One B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
main O
reasons O
that O
I O
've O
been O
such O
a O
pathetic O
, O
%uh O
, O
correspondent O
has O
been O
work O
. O

I O
've O
actually O
been O
doing O
a O
lot O
of O
it O
. O

oh O
wow O
. O

And O
%uh O
, O
I O
turned O
in O
my O
Master O
's O
thesis O
back O
in O
May B-DATE
, O

and O
I O
'm O
actually O
presently O
working O
on O
, O
%um O
, O
several O
, O
%uh O
, O
articles O
oh O
, O
okay O
. O
Impressive O
. O
from O
it O
. O

yeah O
, O

actually O
it O
turns O
out O
that O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
little O
bit O
in O
what O
I O
was O
doing O
, O
%uh O
, O
is O
going O
to O
turn O
out O
to O
be O
very O
important O
in O
the O
end O
. O
%uh O
, O
from O
what O
I O
had O
been O
reading O
in O
the O
literature O
. O

You O
see O
the O
one O
very O
annoying O
thing O
about O
all O
of O
this O
, O
was O
my O
advisor O
has O
been O
in O
France B-GPE
for O
a B-DATE
year I-DATE
and I-DATE
a I-DATE
half I-DATE
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
this O
made O
writing O
my O
thesis O
very O
annoying O
because O
you O
know O
there O
was O
n't O
much O
discussion O
. O

yeah O
. O

yup O
, O

yup O
. O

But O
, O
%um O
Anyway O
, O
I O
had O
been O
kind O
of O
telling O
him O
that O
, O
you O
know O
, O
from O
my O
reading O
of O
the O
literature O
, O
I O
thought O
that O
this O
one B-CARDINAL
little O
alteration O
I O
had O
made O
in O
my O
model O
was O
kind O
of O
clever O
and O
unique O
. O

mhm O
. O

And O
it O
made O
the O
one B-CARDINAL
type O
of O
solution O
occur O
, O
which O
was O
seen O
experimentally O
, O

but O
none O
of O
the O
other O
models O
%uh O
, O
had O
? O

Yes O
. O

the- O
, O

I O
'm O
looking O
at O
, O
%um O
, O
multi O
mode O
lasers O
. O

And O
one O
of O
the O
things O
that O
they O
find O
experimentally O
are O
what O
they O
call O
anti O
phased O
, O
%uh O
, O
states O
, O
where O
if O
you O
look O
at O
the O
total O
intensity O
uh-huh O
. O
of O
the O
laser O
, O
you O
get O
an O
oscillation O
which O
is O
characterized O
by O
one B-CARDINAL
frequency O
. O

Yes O
. O

okay O
. O

if O
you O
separate O
out O
the O
different O
modes O
of O
the O
laser O
mhm O
. O
and O
look O
at O
one O
of O
those O
, O
you O
get O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
frequency O
. O

okay O
. O

So O
what O
's O
happening O
is O
that O
the O
modes O
are O
oscillating O
out O
of O
phase O
so O
that O
they O
completely O
mask O
each O
other O
's O
Exactly O
. O
%hm O
. O
oscillations O
on O
these O
other O
frequencies O
. O

And O
%uh O
With O
a O
pretty O
simple O
model O
you O
can O
find O
that O
frequency O
in O
a O
transient O
, O

but O
you O
ca O
n't O
find O
that O
frequency O
in O
a O
driven O
, O
%uh O
, O
frequency O
. O

You O
ca O
n't O
find O
so O
that O
it O
will O
sustain O
. O

okay O
. O

Yes O
. O

So O
yeah O
, O
that O
particular O
frequency O
according O
to O
most O
models O
damps O
out O
very O
quickly O
. O

And O
so O
you O
should O
n't O
actually O
really O
be O
able O
to O
ever O
see O
it O
. O

%hm O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
is O
, O
that O
, O
when O
you O
do O
the O
experiment O
you O
see O
it O
. O

Got O
it O
, O

got O
it O
. O

I O
see O
. O

So O
, O
%um O
, O
I O
found O
a O
simple O
modification O
of O
the O
original O
formula O
, O
which O
unfortunately O
makes O
the O
solutions O
horrendously O
nasty O
. O
And O
in O
most O
cases O
, O
%uh O
, O
insoluble O
. O

But O
yeah O
. O
it O
gives O
a O
driving O
term O
. O

oh O
, O
okay O
. O

So O
, O
it O
actually O
creates O
a O
situation O
where O
you O
get O
the O
right O
sort O
of O
answer O
, O
you O
just O
ca O
n't O
always O
write O
it O
down O
very O
easily O
. O

Exactly O
. O

oh O
wow O
. O

so O
you O
're O
pushing O
forward O
the O
bounds O
of O
theoretical O
laser O
, O
%uh O
, O
whatever O
it O
is O
science O
. O

But O

which O
, O
%um O
, O
is O
kind O
of O
interesting O
considering O
that O
that O
's O
not O
really O
my O
thing O
. O
. O
Indeed O
. O
Indeed O
. O
being O
an O
experimentalist O
, O
not O
a O
theorist O
. O

%um O
Indeed O
. O
oh O
wow O
. O
oh O
, O
impressive O
. O
But O

so O
are O
you O
going O
to O
get O
an O
article O
in O
Nature B-ORG
or O
something O
? O

%um O
, O
actually O
, O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
if O
we O
're O
shooting O
for O
op- O
, O

I O
think O
Optics B-ORG
Letters I-ORG
is O
probably O
the O
one O
that O
we O
're O
shooting O
for O
, O
or O
else O
, O
perhaps O
, O
though O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
quite O
that O
significant O
, O
would O
be O
Phys B-ORG
Rev I-ORG
Letters I-ORG
. O

%hm O
. O

But O
, O
%uh O
, O
we O
want O
to O
write O
a O
letter O
, O
and O
then O
a B-CARDINAL
couple I-CARDINAL
articles O
. O

yeah O
. O

%hm O
. O
impressive O
. O

And O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
much O
you O
know O
about O
scientific O
literature O
, O

but O
letters O
are O
much O
more O
prestigious O
than O
, O
articles O
. O

oh O
, O
okay O
. O

oh O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
realize O
that O
. O

okay O
. O

yeah O
, O

so O
that O
's O
why O
it O
's O
actually O
a O
big O
deal O
is O

I O
mean O
, O
you O
know O
, O
writing O
a O
couple O
of O
articles O
based O
on O
your O
Master O
's O
thesis O
, O
is O
, O
not O
at O
all O
unusual O
in O
Physics O

and O
yeah O
. O
%uh O
, O
it O
's O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
would O
be O
writing O
a O
letter O
that O
is O
the O
impressive O
part O
of O
it O
all O
. O

And O
what O
's O
actually O
kind O
of O
interesting O
is O
I O
kept O
telling O
Neil B-PERSON
that O
I O
thought O
that O
this O
was O
kind O
of O
significant O
. O

And O
Neil B-PERSON
kept O
writing O
back O
that O
I O
should O
tone O
this O
part O
of O
the O
thesis O
down O
that O
You O
know O
, O
people O
see O
the O
anti O
phased O
motion O
, O

and O
it O
's O
true O

they O
do O
in O
the O
transients O

And O
I O
was O
having O
a O
lot O
of O
trouble O
getting O
across O
to O
him O
that O
all O
of O
the O
literature O
has O
this O
frequency O
in O
the O
transients O
Yes O
. O
%eh O
and O
not O
driven O
. O

And O
, O
%uh O
, O
what O
happened O
was O
after O
I O
had O
turned O
in O
my O
thesis O
but O
before O
I O
saw O
Neil B-PERSON
again O
, O
he O
went O
to O
a O
conference O
in O
Rochester B-GPE
and O
there O
this O
was O
a O
big O
issue O
among O
the O
people O
who O
were O
doing O
this O
work O
, O
was O
, O
that O
their O
models O
could O
n't O
show O
this O
as O
a O
driven O
frequency O
, O

yet O
their O
experiments O
showed O
it O
as O
a O
driven O
frequency O
. O

oh O
cool O
. O

and O
so O
Neil B-PERSON
then O
-- O
Said O
oh O
just O
a O
second B-TIME
I O
-- O
like O
a B-DATE
week I-DATE
later I-DATE
came O
to O
Bryn B-ORG
Mawr I-ORG

and O
he O
said O
, O
hey O
Lowell B-PERSON
, O
we O
got O
to O
write O
this O
up O
. O

Exactly O
. O

And O
I O
was O
like O
, O
well O
I O
've O
been O
telling O
you O
that O
Neil B-PERSON
. O

Indeed O
. O

So O
Cool O
. O
Cool O
. O
that O
's O
mostly O
the O
sort O
of O
stuff O
that O
I O
'm O
spending O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
on O
now O
. O
%um O

Well O
it O
'll O
look O
good O
on O
your O
C O
V O
, O
your O
resume O
. O

so O
you O
might O
as O
well O
spend O
the O
time O
. O

Yes O
, O
well O
, O

%uh O
, O
no O
, O
it O
's O
definitely O
worth O
doing O
. O
%um O
, O

and O
I O
would O
have O
been O
spending O
more O
time O
on O
it O
if O
it O
were O
n't O
for O
%uh O
dealing O
with O
the O
burglary O
issues O
oh O
yeah O
but O
that O
I O
've O
been O
dealing O
with O
. O

So O
are O
you O
still O
living O
in O
that O
house O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
park O
. O

Yes O
. O

yeah O
, O
okay O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
mean O
the O
thing O
that O
i- O

this O
place O
is O
incredibly O
easy O
to O
break O
into O
if O
you O
want O
to O
. O

oh O
. O

It O
's O
not O
a O
question O
of O
whether O
or O
not O
, O
%uh O
you O
know O
, O
that O
was O
easy O
, O

it O
was O
just O
that O
no O
one O
really O
knew O
it O
was O
worth O
breaking O
into O
. O

Exactly O
. O

Exactly O
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
so O
the O
problem O
is O
that O
now O
they O
found O
out O
that O
it O
's O
worth O
breaking O
into O
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
unfortunately O
. O

Well O
, O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
odd O
. O

They O
've O
stolen O
very O
weird O
things O
for O
the O
most O
part O
. O

%hm O
. O

as O
far O

yeah O

as O
a O
. O

The O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
they O
broke O
in O
, O
what O
they O
stole O
was O
just O
bizarre O
, O

mostly O
worthless O
stuff O
. O

And O
, O
%uh O
%huh O
the O
most O
worthwhile O
thing O
as O
far O
as O
monetary O
value O
went O
that O
they O
stole O
was O
the O
pre-amplifier O
of O
my O
stereo O
. O
Unfortunately O
, O
because O
it O
's O
a O
nice O
pre-amplifier O
, O

it O
has O
an O
off O
board O
power O
supply O
which O
they O
did O
n't O
steal O
, O
which O
makes O
the O
thing O
that O
they O
**stoled** O
absolutely O
worthless O
. O

%huh O
. O

So O
. O

That O
's O
bizarre O
. O
Bizarre O
. O

so O
when O
they O
broke O
in O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
time O
did O
they O
steal O
the O
%uh O
offboard O
amplifier O
? O

Actually O
, O
no O
, O

all O
they O
stole O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
time O
was O
my O
bike O
. O

%huh O
. O

Which O
was O
actually O
where O
the O
major O
problem O
came O
. O
Exactly O
. O
Exactly O
. O
yeah O
. O
Is O
that O
I O
suddenly O
had O
no O
transportation O
. O

And O
so O
, O
I O
then O
had O
to O
go O
bike O
hunting O
and O
eventually O
get O
another O
bike O
, O

and O
%mm O
. O
that O
cost O
me O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
. O

yeah O
. O

Exactly O
. O

Because O
, O

yes O

Spending O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
hunting O
for O
bikes O
, O
and O
nah O
well O
. O
then O
getting O
one B-CARDINAL
purchased O
, O
and O
then O
having O
to O
, O
you O
know O
, O
go O
get O
it O
and O
things O
like O
that O
. O

But O
, O
that O
's O
dealt O
with O
at O
least O
. O

And O
so O
%uh O
, O
that O
's O
yeah O
at O
least O
dealt O
with O
. O

Now O
I O
just O
have O
to O
work O
on O
the O
financial O
aspects O
of O
all O
of O
this O
. O

But O
yeah O
. O
yeah O
. O

At O
least O
Well O
that O
would O
make O
sense O
during O
the O
summer O
%uh O
according O
to O
the O
stipulations O
of O
my O
fellowship O
, O
I O
can O
actually O
earn O
money O
during O
the B-DATE
summer I-DATE
. O

%um O
, O
how O
are O
you O
guys O
? O

How O
is O
Chris B-PERSON

and O
how O
are O
you O
? O

Well O

well O

%uh O

Not O

? O

Well O
the O
relative O
scene O
is O
kind O
of O
sad O
. O

You O
know O
everybody O
's O
kind O
of O
passed O
away O
, O
almost O
. O

yeah O
, O

I O
remember O
when O
I O
talked O
to O
you O
in O
the B-DATE
fall I-DATE
yeah O
. O
yeah O
. O
that O
%uh O

It O
's O
just O
about O

oh O
did O
your O
sister O
die O
? O

My O
sister O
passed O
away O
, O

yeah O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
you O
spoke O
to O
me O
before O
that O
or O
when O
it O
was O
that O
was O
happening O
. O
Or O

I O
guess O
not O

When O
was O
it O
? O

It O
may O
have O
been O
right O
after O
. O

Well O

My O
father O
died O
right O
after O
we O
talked O
. O

oh O
god O
. O

yeah O
. O

yeah O
, O

we O
're O
getting O
old O
. O

No O
, O
it O
's O
, O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
it O
is O
. O

It O
's O
just O
, O
%uh O
, O
people O
get O
sick O
, O

and O
they O
get O
sick O
pretty O
young O
, O

and O
, O

yeah O
. O

And O
you O
know O
my O
sister O
was O
n't O
that O
old O

and O
she O
just O
had O
bad O
luck O
I O
guess O
is O
all O
you O
can O
say O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
'm O
going O
to O
put O
you O
on O
after O
fifteen B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
. O

I O
've O
got O
to O

And O
there O
was O
n't O
anything O
anybody O
could O
do O
. O

So O
. O

And O
then O
an O
aunt O
of O
Chris B-PERSON
's O
Aunt O
Mamie B-PERSON
up O
in O
Maine B-GPE
passed O
away O
. O

that O
had O
n't O
happ- O
, O

had O
that O
happened O
already O
? O

No O

No O
that O
had O
not O
happened O
, O
no O
. O

She O
passed O
away O
in O
about B-DATE
March I-DATE
or O

yeah O
, O
I O
think O
that O
there O
was O
some O
concern O
about O
her O
when O
I O
talked O
to O
you O
in O
September B-DATE
or O
October B-DATE
. O

. O

yeah O
. O

No O
, O
she O
was O
not O
doing O
well O
. O

She O
had O
a O
brain O
tumor O
. O

And O
then O
they O
operated O
on O

and O
things O
were O
n't O
going O
well O
, O

and O
. O

I O
actually O
got O
to O
see O
her O
I O
guess O
a O
day O
before O
she O
died O
. O

oh O
. O

I O
mean O
she O
did O
n't O
know O
that O
I O
was O
there O
. O

if O
that O
was O
you O
, O
yeah O
. O
yeah O
, O
she O
was O
just O
not O
in O

So O
it O
was O
a O
blessing O
, O
I O
guess O
. O

But O
, O
%um O
. O

Anyway O
, O
weird O
stuff O
. O

yeah O
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
how O
about O
you O
? O

Because O
, O
I O
r- O

oh O
I O
'm O
han- O

how O
are O
your O
eyes O
? O

yeah O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

I O
have O
to O
go O
next B-DATE
week I-DATE
you O
know O
to O
see O
again O
. O

I O
, O
%um O
, O
not O
exactly O
convinced O
that O
. O
It O
's O
okay O
. O
You O
know O
, O

I O
'm O
not O
sure O
. O

%hm O
. O

%uh O
, O
it O
's O
been O
pretty O
good O
. O

It O
was O
about O
eighty B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
for O
a O
while O
. O

And O
then O
%um O
, O
I O
'm O
not O
exactly O
sure O
what O
it O
is O
now O
. O

But O
I O
'll O
know O
in O
a B-DATE
couple I-DATE
of I-DATE
days I-DATE
. O

So O
are O
you O
having O
blurred O
vision O
? O

Or O

oh O
yeah O
, O
yeah O
. O

Sure O
. O

The O
right O
eye O
is O
%uh O
, O
not O
so O
great O
. O

%hm O
. O

%um O
, O
and O
it O
got O
back O
to O
about B-PERCENT
eighty I-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
. O

You O
know O
it O
was O
a O
detached O
retina O
. O

Right O
. O

And O
then O
they O
operated O
on O
it O
once O
, O

and O
they O
operated O
on O
it O
twice O
. O

And O
, O
then O
things O
seemed O
to O
be O
doing O
pretty O
well O
, O

and O
at O
the O
moment O
I O
'm O
%um O
, O
not O
quite O
so O
sure O
. O

%hm O
. O

So O
, O
who O
knows O
. O
%um O
. O

%hm O
. O

But O
you O
know O
it O
'll O
never O
be O
more O
than O
about B-PERCENT
seventy I-PERCENT
or I-PERCENT
eighty I-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
. O
Which O
is O
fine O
. O

Eighty B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
is O
fantastic O
. O

Right O
. O

Right O
. O

%um O

So O
we O
'll O
just O
see O
. O
You O
know O

%hm O
. O
we O
'll O
see O
what O
happens O
. O

Frustrating O
. O

%uh O
, O
yeah O
. O

Annoying O
. O

And O
that O
thing O
that O
came O
up O
recently O
, O
, O
you O
know O
I O
had O
, O
oh O
, O
a O
kind O
of O
a O
knee O
problem O
a B-DATE
couple I-DATE
of I-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
. O

And O
my O
right O
knee O
, O

and O
now O
it O
's O
my O
left O
knee O
. O

you O
know O
, O
it O
's O
just O
a O
pain O
in O
the O
ass O
. O

And O
yeah O
. O
%um O
, O
I O
went O
to O
the O
doctor O

and O
they O
do O
a O
Punktion O
. O
Ich O
weiss O
nicht O
wer O

Anyway O
they O
take O
, O
%uh O
fluid O
out O
of O

And O
if O
it O
gets O
irritated O

some O
pills O
and O
stuff O
. O

And O
, O
it O
's O
just O
a O
pain O
in O
the O
ass O
. O

So O
it O
's O
just O
, O
l- O
. O

is O
that O
like O
water O
on O
the O
knee O
? O

Is O
that O

is O
? O

%um O
, O
well O
that O
's O
what O
happens O

It O
develops O
because O
of O
irritation O
, O
because O
of O
a O
%um O
, O
inflammation O
. O

%hm O

Is O
that O
from O
the O
running O
? O

And O
how O
the O
inflammation O
d- O

yeah O
, O

maybe O
. O

I O
mean O
they O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

mhm O

of O
fast O
walking O
and O
stuff O
. O

But O
you O
know O

mean O
that O
mhm O

should O
n't O
be O
a O
big O
deal O
. O
%um O

Was O

card O
from O
, O

Amy B-PERSON
Gleason I-PERSON

. O

I O
just O
got O
a O
card O
from O
Ron B-PERSON
and O
Doris B-PERSON
, O

oh O
. O

and O
they O
see O
Amy B-PERSON
Gleason I-PERSON
on O
occasion O
. O

And O
so O
I O
think O
they O
told O
me O
that O
. O

yeah O
. O

Have O
you O
heard O
from O
Ron B-PERSON
and O
Doris B-PERSON
? O

Not O
in O
a O
while O
, O
no O
. O

They O
are O
now O
living O
in O
Rhode B-GPE
Island I-GPE
. O

You O
probably O
knew O
that O
. O

Well O
. O
yeah O
. O

And O
she O
's O
teaching O
at O
U B-ORG
R I-ORG
I I-ORG
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
it O
was O
a O
very O
nice O
letter O
, O
because O
it O
sounded O
like O
she O
went O
through O
very O
similar O
things O
that O
I O
did O
. O

You O
know O
, O
I O
went O
from O
Chicago B-GPE
to O
U B-ORG
C I-ORG
S I-ORG
G I-ORG
to O
here O
. O

Right O
. O

And O
it O
's O
just O
such O
an O
intellectual O
letdown O
. O

Right O
. O

And O
she O
went O
from O
Penn B-ORG
, O
%um O
To O
Columbia B-ORG
. O
to O
Columbia B-ORG
to O
U B-ORG
R I-ORG
I I-ORG
. O

Well O
Columbia B-ORG
's O
okay O
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
she O
said O
the O
students O
are O
just O
, O

you O
know O
, O
they O
do O
n't O
care O
, O

and O
they O
're O
not O
very O
good O
, O

and O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
she O
's O
getting O
conference O
papers O
rejected O

and O
she O
thinks O
it O
's O
the O
affiliation O
. O

yeah O
. O

Because O
she O
does O
n't O
think O
the O
quality O
of O
her O
work O
has O
changed O
. O

Now O
I O
have O
n't O
submitted O
a O
conference O
paper O
with O
the O
Missouri B-ORG
%um O
, O
you O
know O
, O
affiliation O
yet O
. O

Because O
the O
last O
one O
I O
submitted O
, O
%um O
, O
was O
in O
the O
fall O
, O

and O
I O
still O
had O
my O
San B-ORG
Diego I-ORG
affiliation O
. O

yeah O
. O

%um O
, O
in O
fact O
I O
'm O
still O
officially O
on O
leave O
. O

If O
anything O
came O
up O
in O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
year I-DATE
we O
could O
still O
go O
back O
. O
uh-huh O
. O
%uh O
you O
know O
, O
for O
Sam B-PERSON
. O

Wow O
. O

But O
I O
think O
it O
's O
very O
very O
very O
very O
yeah O
. O
unlikely O
. O

yeah O
. O

But O
at O
any O
rate O
it O
was O
nice O
to O
hear O
from O
her O
because O
she O
said O
after B-DATE
two I-DATE
years I-DATE
there O
now O
, O
she O
%um O
has O
come O
to O
terms O
with O
this O
, O

and O
yeah O
. O
she O
's O
accepted O
that O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
good O
things O
in O
Rhode B-GPE
Island I-GPE
. O

And O
, O
%um O
, O
you O
know O
, O
their O
life O
is O
a O
lot O
less O
complicated O
, O

and O
she O
has O
more O
time O
to O
be O
a O
parent O
. O

yeah O
. O

Good O
. O

And O
she O
's O
just O
not O
going O
to O
have O
the O
same O
kind O
of O
career O
that O
she O
had O
thought O
about O
. O

Ron B-PERSON
is O
working O
as O
a O
financial O
consultant O
for O
, O
%um O
, O
Meryl B-ORG
Lynch I-ORG
. O

And O
he O

oh O
. O

yeah O
, O
he O
had O
been O
doing O
work O
for O
some O
environmental O
firm O
, O
as O
a O
consultant O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

And O
, O
it O
did O
n't O
work O
out O
. O

%um O
He O
was O
changing O
projects O
every B-DATE
couple I-DATE
of I-DATE
weeks I-DATE

and O
he O
said O
he O
could O
n't O
keep O
on O
top O
of O
it O
. O

He O
could O
n't O
learn O
the O
whole O
new O
area O
%mm O
. O
that O
fast O
each O
time O
. O

%mm O
. O

%um O
, O
and O
he O
says O
he O
went O
in O
and O
had O
some O
tests O
, O

and O
he O
was O
diagnosed O
as O
having O
attention O
deficit O
disorder O
. O

Which O
you O
know O
, O
given O
how O
far O
he O
's O
gotten O
, O
you O
know O
, O
he O
got O
his O
degree O
at O
Tufts B-ORG
and O
all O
, O
I O
found O
that O
surprising O
that O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
as O
an O
adult O
they O
're O
diagnosing O
this O
. O
%um O

%mm O
. O
I O
wonder O
about O
it O
. O

But O
anyway O
. O

yeah O
, O

but O
that O
's O
what O
he O
said O
. O

And O
%um O

yeah O
. O

He O
%um O

Whatever O
's O
helpful O
. O

Right O
. O

So O
he O
found O
this O
new O
job O
as O
a O
financial O
consultant O
and O
seems O
to O
be O
happy O
with O
that O
. O

Good O
. O
