American B-NORP

Japanese B-NORP

offered O
several O
theories O
for O
the O
difference O

betwen O
Mr. O

Mrs. O

Many O
called O
it O
simply O
a O
contrast O

But O
some O
saw O
it O
as O
a O
classic O
negotiating O
tactic O
. O

Others O
said O
the O
Bush B-PERSON
administration O
may O
feel O
the O
rhetoric O
on O
both O
sides O
is O
getting O
out O

And O
some O
said O
it O
reflected O
the O
growing O
debate O
in O
Washington B-GPE
over O

some O
kind O

Mrs. O

`` O
I O
did O

who O
sat O
in O

her O
during O
three B-DATE

her O

often O
was O
surprisingly O
`` O

'' O

`` O
I O
think O
my O

been O
very O

'' O
Mrs. O

said O
at O
a O
news O
conference O
Saturday B-DATE
afternoon B-TIME
. O

`` O
I O
am O
painted O
sometimes O
as O
ferocious O

perhaps O
because O
I O

'' O

When O
she O
met O
the O
local O
press O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
on O
Friday B-DATE
, O
Mrs. O
Hills B-PERSON
firmly O
reiterated O
the O
need O
for O
progress O
in O
removing O
barriers O
to O
trade O
in O
forest O
products O
, O
satellites O
and O
supercomputers O
, O
three B-CARDINAL
areas O
targeted O
under O
the O
Super B-LAW
301 I-LAW
provision O
of O
the O
1988 O
trade O
bill O
. O

She O
highlighted O
exclusionary O
business O
practices O
that O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
government O
has O
identified O
. O

But O
her O
main O
thrust O
was O
to O
promote O
the O
importance O
of O
world O
- O
wide O
free O
trade O
and O
open O
competition O
. O

She O
said O
the O
trade O
imbalance O
was O
mainly O
due O
to O
macroeconomic O
factors O
and O
should O
n't O
be O
tackled O
by O
setting O
quantitative O
targets O
. O

At O
her O
news O
conference O
for O
Japanese B-NORP
reporters O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
economics O
journalist O
summed O
up O
the O
Japanese B-NORP
sense O
of O
relief O
. O

`` O
My O
impression O
was O
that O
you O
would O
be O
a O
scary O
old O
lady O

'' O
he O
said O
, O
drawing O
a O
few O
nervous O
chuckles O
from O
his O
colleagues O

`` O
But O
I O
am O
relieved O

'' O

Mrs. O
Hills B-PERSON
' O
remarks O
did O
raise O
questions O
, O
at O
least O
among O
some O
U.S. B-GPE
officials O
, O
about O
what O
exactly O
her O
stance O
is O
on O
U.S. B-GPE
access O
to O
the O
Japanese B-NORP
semiconductor O
market O
. O

The O
U.S. B-GPE
share O
of O
the O
Japanese B-NORP
market O
has O
been O
stuck O
around O
10 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
for O
years B-DATE
. O

Many O
Americans B-NORP
have O
interpreted O
a O
1986 B-DATE
agreement O
as O
assuring O
U.S. B-GPE
companies O
a O
20 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
share O
by O
1991 B-DATE
, O
but O
the O
Japanese B-NORP
have O
denied O
making O
any O
such O
promise O
. O

At O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
her O
news O
conferences O
, O
Mrs. O
Hills B-PERSON
said O
, O
`` O
I O
believe O
we O
can O
do O
much O
better O
than O
20 B-PERCENT

'' O

But O
she O
stressed O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
against O

I O
will O
not O
enter O
into O
an O

Here O

of O

remarks O
, O
quoted O
first B-ORDINAL
in O
the B-ORG

while O
he O
was O
a O

, O
and O
then O
in O
Newsweek B-ORG
after O
he O
and O
the O

parted O
company O
. O

Mr. O
Mason B-PERSON
said O
that O
many O
Jewish B-NORP
voters O
feel O
guilty O
toward O
blacks O
, O
so O
they O
support O
black O

uncritically O
. O

He O
said O
that O
many O
black O
voters O
feel O
bitter O
about O
racial O
discrimination O
, O
so O
they O
, O
too O
, O
support O
black O
candidates O
uncritically O
. O

He O
said O
that O
Jews B-NORP
have O
contributed O
more O
to O
black O
causes O
over O
the B-DATE
years I-DATE
than O
vice O
versa O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
Mr. O
Mason B-PERSON
did O
not O
use O
neutral O
language O
. O

As O
a O
practitioner O
of O
ethnic O
humor O
from O
the B-DATE
old I-DATE
days I-DATE
on O
the B-LOC
Borscht I-LOC
Belt I-LOC
, O
live O
television O
and O
the O
nightclub O
circuit O
, O
Mr. O
Mason B-PERSON
instinctively O
reached O
for O
the O
vernacular O
. O

He O
said O
Jews B-NORP
were O
`` O
sick O
with O
complexes O
'' O
; O
and O
he O
called O
David B-PERSON
Dinkins I-PERSON
, O
Mr. O
Giuliani B-PERSON
's O
black O
opponent O
, O
`` O
a O
fancy O
shvartze O
with O
a O
mustache O
. O
'' O

If O
Mr. O
Mason B-PERSON
had O
used O
less O
derogatory O
language O
to O
articulate O
his O
amateur O
analysis O
of O
the O
voting O
behavior O
of O
his O
fellow O
New B-NORP
Yorkers I-NORP
, O
would O
the O
water O
be O
quite O
so O
hot O
? O

It O
probably O
would O
, O
because O
few O
or O
none O
of O
the O
people O
upset O
by O
Mr. O
Mason B-PERSON
's O
remarks O
have O
bothered O
to O
distinguish O
between O
the O
substance O
of O
his O
comments O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
used O
insulting O
language O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
some O
of O
Mr. O
Mason B-PERSON
's O
critics O
have O
implied O
that O
his O
type O
of O
ethnic O
humor O
is O
itself O
a O
form O
of O
racism O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
state O
counsel O
for O
the O
NAACP B-ORG
said O
that O
Mr. O
Mason B-PERSON
is O
`` O
like O
a O
dinosaur O
. O

People O
are O
fast O
leaving O
the O
place O
where O
he O
is O
stuck O
. O
'' O

These O
critics O
fail O
to O
distinguish O
between O
the O
type O
of O
ethnic O
humor O
that O
aims O
at O
disparaging O
another O
group O
, O
such O
as O
`` O
Polish B-NORP
jokes O
'' O
; O
and O
the O
type O
that O
is O
double O
- O
edged O
, O
aiming O
inward O
as O
well O
as O
outward O
. O

The O
latter O
typically O
is O
the O
humor O
of O
the O
underdog O
, O
and O
it O
was O
perfected O
by O
both O
blacks O
and O
Jews B-NORP
on O
the O
minstrel O
and O
vaudeville O
stage O
as O
a O
means O
of O
mocking O
their O
white O
and O
gentile O
audiences O
along O
with O
themselves O
. O

In O
the O
hands O
of O
a O
zealot O
like O
Lenny B-PERSON
Bruce I-PERSON
, O
this O
double O
- O
edged O
blade O
could O
cut O
both O
the O
self O
and O
the O
audience O
to O
ribbons O
. O

But O
wielded O
by O
a O
pro O
like O
Jackie B-PERSON
Mason I-PERSON
, O
it O
is O
a O
constructive O
form O
of O
mischief O
. O

Why O
constructive O
? O

Because O
despite O
all O
the O
media O
prattle O
about O
comedy O
and O
politics O
not O
mixing O
, O
they O
are O
similar O
in O
one B-CARDINAL
respect O
: O
Both O
can O
serve O
as O
mechanisms O
for O
easing O
tensions O
and O
facilitating O
the O
co-existence O
of O
groups O
in O
conflict O
. O

That O
's O
why O
it O
's O
dangerous O
to O
have O
well O
- O
intentioned O
thought O
police O
, O
on O
college O
campuses O
and O
elsewhere O
, O
taboo O
all O
critical O
mention O
of O
group O
differences O
. O

As O
Elizabeth B-PERSON
Kristol I-PERSON
wrote O
in O
the B-ORG
New I-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
just O
before O
the O
Mason B-PERSON
donnybrook O
, O
`` O
Perhaps O
intolerance O
would O
not O
boil O
over O
with O
such O
intensity O
if O
honest O
differences O
were O
allowed O
to O
simmer O
. O
'' O

The O
question O
is O
, O
if O
group O
conflicts O
still O
exist O
-LRB- O
as O
undeniably O
they O
do O
-RRB- O
, O
and O
if O
Mr. O
Mason B-PERSON
's O
type O
of O
ethnic O
humor O
is O
passe O
, O
then O
what O
other O
means O
do O
we O
have O
for O
letting O
off O
steam O
? O

Do O
n't O
say O
the O
TV O
sitcom O
, O
because O
that O
happens O
to O
be O
a O
genre O
that O
, O
in O
its O
desperate O
need O
to O
attract O
everybody O
and O
offend O
nobody O
, O
resembles O
politics O
more O
than O
it O
does O
comedy O
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
the O
best O
sitcoms O
do O
allow O
group O
differences O
to O
simmer O
: O
yuppies O
vs. O
blue O
- O
collar O
Bostonians B-NORP
in O
`` O
Cheers B-WORK_OF_ART
'' O
; O
children O
vs. O
adults O
in O
`` O
The B-WORK_OF_ART
Cosby I-WORK_OF_ART
Show I-WORK_OF_ART
. O
'' O

But O
these O
are O
not O
the O
differences O
that O
make O
headlines O
. O

In O
`` O
Chicken B-WORK_OF_ART
Soup I-WORK_OF_ART
, O
'' O
Mr. O
Mason B-PERSON
plays O
Jackie B-PERSON
, O
a O
Jewish B-NORP
bachelor O
courting O
Maddie B-PERSON
-LRB- B-PERSON
Lynn I-PERSON
Redgrave I-PERSON
-RRB- I-PERSON
, O
an O
Irish B-NORP

and O
mother O

against O
the O
wishes O
of O
his O
mother O
-LRB- O
Rita B-PERSON
Karin I-PERSON
-RRB- O
and O
her O
brother O
Michael B-PERSON
-LRB- O
Brandon B-PERSON
Maggart I-PERSON
-RRB- O
. O

It O
's O
worth O
noting O
that O
both O
disapproving O
relatives O
are O
immigrants O
. O

At O
least O
, O
they O
both O
speak O
with O
strong O
accents O
, O
as O
do O
Jackie B-PERSON
and O
Maddie B-PERSON
. O

It O
could O
n't O
be O
more O
obvious O
that O
`` O
Chicken B-WORK_OF_ART
Soup I-WORK_OF_ART
'' O
is O
being O
made O
from O
an O
old O
recipe O
. O

And O
a O
safe O
one O
-- O
imagine O
if O
the O
romance O
in O
question O
were O
between O
an B-NORP
Orthodox I-NORP
Jew I-NORP
and O
a O
member O
of O
the B-NORP
Nation I-NORP
of I-NORP
Islam I-NORP
. O

Back O
in O
the B-DATE
1920s I-DATE
, O
the O
play O
and O
movie O
versions O
of O
`` O
Abie B-WORK_OF_ART
's I-WORK_OF_ART
Irish I-WORK_OF_ART
Rose I-WORK_OF_ART
'' O
made O
the O
theme O
of O
courtship O
between O
the O
assimilated O
offspring O
of O
Jewish B-NORP
and O
Irish B-NORP
immigrants O
so O
popular O
that O
its O
author O
, O
Anne B-PERSON
Nichols I-PERSON
, O
lost O
a O
plagiarism O
suit O
on O
the O
grounds O
that O
the O
plot O
has O
entered O
the O
public O
domain O
. O

And O
it O
has O
remained O
there O
, O
as O
evidenced O
by O
its O
reappearance O
in O
a O
1972 B-DATE
CBS B-ORG
sitcom O
called O
`` O
Bridget B-WORK_OF_ART
Loves I-WORK_OF_ART
Bernie I-WORK_OF_ART
, O
'' O
whose O
sole O
distinction O
was O
that O
it O
led O
to O
the O
real O
- O
life O
marriage O
of O
Meredith B-PERSON
Baxter I-PERSON
and O
David B-PERSON
Birney I-PERSON
. O

Clearly O
, O
the O
question O
with O
`` O
Chicken B-WORK_OF_ART
Soup I-WORK_OF_ART
'' O
is O
not O
whether O
the O
pot O
will O
boil O
over O
, O
but O
whether O
it O
will O
simmer O
at O
all O
. O

So O
far O
, O
the O
bubbles O
have O
been O
few O
and O
far O
between O
. O

Part O
of O
the O
problem O
is O
the O
tendency O
of O
all O
sitcoms O
, O
ever O
since O
the B-DATE
didactic I-DATE
days I-DATE
of O
Norman B-PERSON
Lear I-PERSON
, O
to O
preach O
about O
social O
issues O
. O

To O
some O
extent O
, O
this O
tendency O
emerges O
whenever O
the O
show O
tries O
to O
enlighten O
us O
about O
ethnic O
stereotypes O
by O
reversing O
them O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
dislikes O
Jackie B-PERSON
not O
because O
he O
's O
a O
shrewd O
Jewish B-NORP
businessman O
, O
but O
because O
he O
quits O
his O
well O
- O
paying O
job O
as O
a O
salesman O
in O
order O
to O
become O
a O
social O
worker O
. O

Even O
more O
problematic O
is O
the O
incompatibility O
between O
sitcom O
preachiness O
and O
Mr. O
Mason B-PERSON
's O
comic O
persona O
. O

The O
best O
moments O
in O
the O
show O
occur O
at O
the O
beginning O
and O
the O
end O
-LRB- O
and O
occasionally O
in O
the O
middle O
-RRB- O
, O
when O
Mr. O
Mason B-PERSON
slips O
into O
his O
standup O
mode O
and O
starts O
meting O
out O
that O
old O
- O
fashioned O
Jewish B-NORP
mischief O
to O
other O
people O
as O
well O
as O
to O
himself O
. O

But O
too O
often O
, O
these O
routines O
lack O
spark O
because O
this O
sitcom O
, O
like O
all O
sitcoms O
, O
is O
timid O
about O
confronting O
Mr. O
Mason B-PERSON
's O
stock O
in O
trade O
- O
ethnic O
differences O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
suggesting O
that O
the O
producers O
start O
putting O
together O
episodes O
about O
topics O
like O
the O
Catholic B-NORP
- O
Jewish O
dispute O
over O
the O
Carmelite B-NORP
convent O
at O
Auschwitz B-FAC
. O

That O
issue O
, O
like O
racial O
tensions O
in O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
City I-GPE
, O
will O
have O
to O
cool O
down O
, O
not O
heat O
up O
, O
before O
it O
can O
simmer O
. O

But O
I O
am O
suggesting O
that O
they O
stop O
requiring O
Mr. O
Mason B-PERSON
to O
interrupt O
his O
classic O
shtik O
with O
some O
line O
about O
`` O
caring O
for O
other O
people O
'' O
that O
would O
sound O
shmaltzy O
on O
the O
lips O
of O
Miss B-PERSON
America I-PERSON
. O

At O
your O
age O
, O
Jackie B-PERSON

you O
ought O
to O
know O
that O

ca O

make O

It O
focused O

'' O

One B-CARDINAL
obvious O
place O
to O
attach O
a O
capital O
- O
gains O
tax O
cut O
, O
and O
perhaps O
other O
popular O
items O
stripped O
from O
the O
deficit O
- O
reduction O
bill O
, O
is O
the O
legislation O
to O
raise O
the O
federal O
borrowing O
limit O
. O

Such O
legislation O
must O
be O
enacted O
by O
the B-DATE
end I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
month I-DATE
. O

The O
Senate B-ORG
bill O
was O
pared O
back O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
speed O
deficit O
- O
reduction O
through O
Congress B-ORG
. O

Because O
the O
legislation O
has O

President O

until O
midnight B-TIME

mandated O
by O
the O

Senators O
hope O
that O
the O
need O
to O
avoid O
those O
cuts O
will O
pressure O
the O
House B-ORG
to O
agree O
to O
the O
streamlined O
bill O
. O

The O
House B-ORG
appears O
reluctant O
to O
join O
the O
senators O
. O

A O
key O
is O
whether O
House B-ORG
Republicans B-NORP
are O
willing O
to O
acquiesce O
to O
their O
Senate B-ORG
colleagues O
' O
decision O
to O
drop O

`` O

'' O

Another O
big O
question O
hovering O
over O
the O
debate O
is O
what O
President O

thinks O
. O

He O
has O
been O
resisting O
a O
stripped O

down O
bill O
without O
a O
guaranteed O
vote O
on O
his O
capital O
- O
gains O
tax O
cut O

But O
Republican B-NORP
senators O
saw O
no O
way O

overcome O
a O
procedural O
hurdle O
and O
garner O
the O
60 B-CARDINAL
votes O
needed O
to O
win O
the O
capital O

issue O
on O
the O
floor O
, O
so O
they O
went O
ahead O
with O
the O
streamlined O
bill O
. O

The O
Senate B-ORG
bill O
was O
stripped O
of O
many O
popular O
, O
though O
revenue O

losing O

provisions O

a O
number O
of O
which O
are O
included O

Also O
missing O
from O
the O
Senate B-ORG
bill O
is O
the O
House B-ORG

repeal O
of O
a O
law O
, O
called O
Section B-LAW

the O

In O

the O

concentrated O
as O
the O
new O
Cheer B-PRODUCT
, O
bombed O
in O
a O

test O
in O

P&G B-ORG
and O

have O
tried O
repeatedly O
to O
hook O
consumers O
on O
detergent O

in O

, O
but O
they O
have O
n't O
sold O
well O
, O
despite O
the O
convenience O
. O

But O
P&G B-ORG
contends O
the O
new O
Cheer B-PRODUCT
is O
a O
unique O
formula O
that O
also O
offers O
an O
ingredient O
that O
prevents O
colors O

. O

And O
retailers O
are O
expected O
to O
embrace O
the O

it O
will O
take O
up O
less O

`` O
When O

But O
with O
so O
many O

that O
's O
no O
longer O
the O
case O
. O

If O
the O
new O
Cheer B-PRODUCT
sells O
well O
, O
the O
trend O
toward O
smaller O
packaging O
is O
likely O
to O
accelerate O
as O
competitors O
follow O
with O
their O

superconcentrates O

Then O

`` O

with O
the O

that O

not O
draw O
an O

against O

assert O
their O
Fifth B-LAW
Amendment I-LAW
privilege O
against O

- O

in O

. O

The B-LAW
Fifth I-LAW
Amendment I-LAW
states O
in O
relevant O
part O
that O
no O
person O
`` O
shall O
be O
compelled O
, O
in O
any O
criminal O
case O
, O
to O
be O
a O
witness O
against O

. O
'' O

This O
privilege O
against O
self O
- O
incrimination O
precludes O
the O
drawing O
of O
an O
adverse O
inference O
against O
a O
criminal O
defendant O
who O
chooses O
not O
to O
testify O
. O

Thus O
, O
in O
a O
criminal O
case O
, O
a O
prosecutor O
can O
not O
comment O
on O
a O
defendant O
's O
failure O
to O
testify O
nor O
can O
the O
defendant O
be O
compelled O
to O
take O
the O
stand O
as O
a O
witness O
, O
thus O
forcing O
him O
to O
`` O
take O
the O
Fifth B-LAW
. O
'' O

The O
privilege O
, O
however O
, O
has O
been O
limited O
in O
accordance O
with O
its O
plain O
language O
to O
protect O
the O
defendant O
in O
criminal O
matters O
only O
. O

The B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
and O
some O
states O
have O
specifically O
recognized O
that O
`` O
the B-LAW
Fifth I-LAW
Amendment I-LAW
does O
not O
preclude O
the O
inference O
where O
the O

is O

Thus O
, O
in O
a O

, O
a O

may O
be O
called O
as O
a O

, O
he O

the O
drawing O
of O
an O

him O

He O
may O
take O

a O
good O

justifiable O

Allowing O
the O
defendant O
to O
take O
the O
Fifth B-LAW
in O
a O
civil O
matter O
is O
not O
based O
on O
a O
constitutional O
right O
to O
refuse O
to O
testify O
where O
one O
's O
testimony O
harms O
him O
in O
the O

because O
the O

the O

could O
be O
unconstitutionally O
used O
against O
him O
in O
a O

Absent O
the O
risk O
of O
such O
prosecution O
, O
a O
court O
may O
order O
the O

Thus O
, O
when O
Mr. O
Pierce B-PERSON
asserted O
the O
Fifth B-LAW
in O
a O
noncriminal O
proceeding O
, O
particularly O
after O

one B-CARDINAL

justifiable O
belief O
that O

be O
used O

The O

have O
every O
right O

the B-DATE

One B-CARDINAL
reason O
is O
mounting O
competition O
from O
new O
Japanese B-NORP
car O

in O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
that O
are O
pouring O
out O

Another O
is O
that O

GM B-ORG
officials O
want O
to O

strategy O
to O
reduce O
capacity O
and O
the O
work O
force O
in O
place O
before O
those O
talks O
begin O
. O

The O
problem O
, O
however O
, O
is O
that O
GM B-ORG

moves O
are O
coming O
at O
a O
time O
when O
UAW B-ORG

some O
in O

contend O
that O

the O

here O
many O

that O
its O

is O
to O
blame O
for O
the O
European B-NORP
TV O
industry O

sluggish O
development O
. O

Until O
recently O
, O
national O
governments O
in O
Europe B-LOC
controlled O
most O
of O
the O

allowed O
little O

no O

Since O
production O

it O
did O

put O

But O
not O

a O

that O
encouraged O

Now O
