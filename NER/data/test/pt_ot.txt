Saul O
told O
his O
son O
Jonathan O
and O
his O
officers O
to O
kill O
David O
. O

But O
Jonathan O
liked O
David O
very O
much O
, O
so O
he O
warned O
him O
. O

`` O
Be O
careful O
! O

Saul O
is O
looking O
for O
a O
chance O
to O
kill O
you O
. O

In O
the O
morning O
go O
into O
the O
field O
and O
hide O
. O

I O
will O
go O
out O
into O
the O
field O
with O
my O
father O
. O

We O
will O
stand O
in O
the O
field O
where O
you O
are O
hiding O
. O

I O
will O
talk O
to O
my O
father O
about O
you O
, O
and O
I O
will O
tell O
you O
what O
I O
learn O
. O
'' O

Jonathan O
talked O
to O
his O
father O
Saul O
. O

Jonathan O
said O
good O
things O
about O
David O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
are O
the O
king O
. O

David O
is O
your O
servant O
. O

David O
has O
n't O
done O
anything O
wrong O
to O
you O
, O
so O
do O
n't O
do O
anything O
wrong O
to O
him O
. O

He O
has O
always O
been O
good O
to O
you O
. O

He O
risked O
his O
life O
when O
he O
killed O
the O
Philistine O
. O

The O
Lord O
won O
a O
great O
victory O
for O
all O
Israel O
. O

You O
saw O
it O
, O
and O
you O
were O
happy O
. O

Why O
do O
you O
want O
to O
hurt O
David O
? O

He O
's O
innocent O
. O

There O
is O
no O
reason O
to O
kill O
him O
. O
'' O

Saul O
listened O
to O
Jonathan O
and O
made O
a O
promise O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
As O
surely O
as O
the O
Lord O
lives O
, O
David O
wo O
n't O
be O
put O
to O
death O
. O
'' O

So O
Jonathan O
called O
David O
and O
told O
him O
everything O
that O
was O
said O
. O

Then O
Jonathan O
brought O
David O
to O
Saul O
, O
and O
David O
was O
with O
Saul O
as O
before O
. O

Once O
again O
there O
was O
war O
with O
the O
Philistines O
, O
and O
David O
went O
out O
to O
fight O
. O

He O
defeated O
them O
badly O
, O
and O
they O
ran O
away O
. O

Later O
, O
in O
Saul O
's O
house O
, O
David O
was O
playing O
the O
harp O
. O

Saul O
was O
there O
with O
his O
spear O
in O
his O
hand O
. O

Then O
an O
evil O
spirit O
from O
the O
Lord O
came O
on O
Saul O
. O

Saul O
threw O
his O
spear O
at O
David O
and O
tried O
to O
pin O
him O
to O
the O
wall O
. O

David O
jumped O
out O
of O
the O
way O
, O
so O
the O
spear O
missed O
him O
and O
stuck O
in O
the O
wall O
. O

That O
night O
, O
David O
ran O
away O
. O

Saul O
sent O
men O
to O
watch O
David O
's O
house O
. O

They O
stayed O
there O
all O
night O
. O

They O
were O
waiting O
to O
kill O
David O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
but O
David O
's O
wife O
Michal O
warned O
him O
. O

She O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
must O
run O
away O
tonight O
and O
save O
your O
life O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
, O
you O
will O
be O
killed O
tomorrow O
. O
'' O

Then O
Michal O
let O
David O
down O
out O
of O
a O
window O
, O
and O
he O
escaped O
and O
ran O
away O
. O

Michal O
took O
the O
household O
god O
, O
put O
clothes O
on O
it O
, O
and O
put O
goats O
' O
hair O
on O
its O
head O
. O

Then O
she O
put O
the O
statue O
in O
the O
bed O
. O

Saul O
sent O
messengers O
to O
take O
David O
prisoner O
. O

But O
Michal O
said O
, O
`` O
David O
is O
sick O
. O
'' O

The O
men O
went O
and O
told O
Saul O
, O
but O
he O
sent O
the O
messengers O
back O
to O
see O
David O
. O

Saul O
told O
these O
men O
, O
`` O
Bring O
David O
to O
me O
. O

Bring O
him O
lying O
on O
his O
bed O
if O
you O
must O
, O
even O
if O
it O
kills O
him O
. O
'' O

The O
messengers O
went O
to O
David O
's O
house O
. O

They O
went O
inside O
to O
get O
him O
, O
but O
they O
saw O
it O
was O
only O
a O
statue O
and O
that O
its O
hair O
was O
only O
goat O
's O
hair O
. O

Saul O
said O
to O
Michal O
, O
`` O
Why O
did O
you O
trick O
me O
like O
this O
? O

You O
let O
my O
enemy O
escape O
, O
and O
now O
he O
is O
gone O
. O
'' O

Michal O
answered O
Saul O
, O
`` O
David O
told O
me O
he O
would O
kill O
me O
if O
I O
did O
n't O
help O
him O
escape O
. O
'' O

David O
escaped O
and O
ran O
away O
to O
Samuel O
at O
Ramah O
. O

He O
told O
Samuel O
everything O
that O
Saul O
had O
done O
to O
him O
. O

Then O
David O
and O
Samuel O
went O
to O
the O
camps O
where O
the O
prophets O
stayed O
. O

David O
stayed O
there O
. O

Saul O
heard O
that O
David O
was O
there O
in O
the O
camps O
near O
Ramah O
. O

So O
he O
sent O
some O
men O
to O
arrest O
David O
. O

But O
when O
they O
came O
to O
the O
camps O
, O
there O
was O
a O
group O
of O
prophets O
prophesying O
. O

Samuel O
was O
standing O
there O
leading O
the O
group O
. O

The O
Spirit O
of O
God O
came O
on O
Saul O
's O
messengers O
and O
they O
began O
prophesying O
. O

Saul O
heard O
about O
this O
, O
so O
he O
sent O
other O
messengers O
, O
but O
they O
also O
began O
prophesying O
. O

So O
Saul O
sent O
messengers O
a O
third O
time O
, O
and O
they O
also O
began O
prophesying O
. O

Finally O
, O
Saul O
himself O
went O
to O
Ramah O
. O

Saul O
came O
to O
the O
big O
well O
by O
the O
threshing O
floor O
at O
Secu O
. O

He O
asked O
, O
`` O
Where O
are O
Samuel O
and O
David O
? O
'' O

The O
people O
answered O
, O
`` O
In O
the O
camps O
near O
Ramah O
. O
'' O

So O
Saul O
went O
out O
to O
the O
camps O
near O
Ramah O
. O

The O
Spirit O
of O
God O
came O
on O
Saul O
, O
and O
he O
also O
began O
prophesying O
. O

He O
prophesied O
all O
the O
way O
to O
the O
camps O
at O
Ramah O
. O

Saul O
even O
took O
off O
his O
clothes O
. O

He O
lay O
there O
naked O
all O
day O
and O
through O
the O
night O
. O

So O
even O
Saul O
prophesied O
there O
in O
front O
of O
Samuel O
. O

That O
is O
why O
people O
say O
, O
`` O
Is O
Saul O
also O
one O
of O
the O
prophets O
? O
'' O

Kish O
was O
an O
important O
man O
from O
the O
tribe O
of O
Benjamin O
. O

He O
was O
the O
son O
of O
Abiel O
. O

Abiel O
was O
the O
son O
of O
Zeror O
. O

Zeror O
was O
the O
son O
of O
Becorath O
. O

Becorath O
was O
the O
son O
of O
Aphiah O
, O
a O
man O
from O
Benjamin O
. O

Kish O
had O
a O
son O
named O
Saul O
, O
who O
was O
a O
handsome O
young O
man O
. O

There O
was O
no O
one O
more O
handsome O
than O
Saul O
. O

He O
stood O
a O
head O
taller O
than O
any O
other O
man O
in O
Israel O
. O

One O
day O
, O
Kish O
's O
donkeys O
got O
lost O
. O

So O
he O
said O
to O
his O
son O
Saul O
, O
`` O
Take O
one O
of O
the O
servants O
and O
go O
look O
for O
the O
donkeys O
. O
'' O

Saul O
went O
to O
look O
for O
the O
donkeys O
. O

He O
walked O
through O
the O
hills O
of O
Ephraim O
and O
through O
the O
area O
around O
Shalisha O
. O

But O
Saul O
and O
the O
servant O
could O
not O
find O
Kish O
's O
donkeys O
. O

So O
they O
went O
to O
the O
area O
around O
Shaalim O
, O
but O
the O
donkeys O
were O
not O
there O
either O
. O

Then O
Saul O
traveled O
through O
the O
land O
of O
Benjamin O
, O
but O
he O
and O
the O
servant O
still O
could O
not O
find O
the O
donkeys O
. O

Finally O
, O
Saul O
and O
the O
servant O
came O
to O
the O
town O
named O
Zuph O
. O

Saul O
said O
to O
his O
servant O
, O
`` O
Let O
's O
go O
back O
. O

My O
father O
will O
stop O
worrying O
about O
the O
donkeys O
and O
start O
worrying O
about O
us O
. O
'' O

But O
the O
servant O
answered O
, O
`` O
A O
man O
of O
God O
is O
in O
this O
town O
. O

People O
respect O
him O
. O

Everything O
he O
says O
comes O
true O
, O
so O
let O
's O
go O
into O
town O
. O

Maybe O
the O
man O
of O
God O
will O
tell O
us O
where O
we O
should O
go O
next O
. O
'' O

Saul O
said O
to O
his O
servant O
, O
`` O
Sure O
, O
we O
can O
go O
into O
town O
, O
but O
what O
can O
we O
give O
to O
him O
? O

We O
have O
no O
gift O
to O
give O
the O
man O
of O
God O
. O

Even O
the O
food O
in O
our O
bags O
is O
gone O
. O

What O
can O
we O
give O
him O
? O
'' O

Again O
the O
servant O
answered O
Saul O
. O

`` O
Look O
, O
I O
have O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
money O
. O

Let O
's O
give O
it O
to O
the O
man O
of O
God O
. O

Then O
he O
will O
tell O
us O
where O
we O
should O
go O
. O
'' O

Saul O
said O
to O
his O
servant O
, O
`` O
That O
is O
a O
good O
idea O
. O

Let O
's O
go O
. O
'' O

So O
they O
went O
to O
the O
town O
where O
the O
man O
of O
God O
was O
. O

Saul O
and O
the O
servant O
were O
walking O
up O
the O
hill O
toward O
town O
when O
they O
met O
some O
young O
women O
on O
the O
road O
. O

The O
young O
women O
were O
coming O
out O
to O
get O
water O
. O

Saul O
and O
the O
servant O
asked O
the O
young O
women O
, O
`` O
Is O
the O
seer O
here O
? O
'' O

-LRB- O
In O
the O
past O
, O
people O
in O
Israel O
called O
a O
prophet O
a O
`` O
seer O
. O
'' O

So O
if O
they O
wanted O
to O
ask O
something O
from O
God O
, O
they O
would O
say O
, O
`` O
Let O
's O
go O
to O
the O
seer O
. O
'' O
-RRB- O

The O
young O
women O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
the O
seer O
is O
here O
. O

He O
is O
just O
up O
the O
road O
. O

He O
came O
to O
town O
today O
. O

Some O
people O
are O
meeting O
together O
today O
to O
share O
in O
a O
fellowship O
offering O
at O
the O
place O
for O
worship O
. O

So O
go O
into O
town O
and O
you O
will O
find O
him O
. O

If O
you O
hurry O
, O
you O
can O
catch O
him O
before O
he O
goes O
up O
to O
eat O
at O
the O
place O
for O
worship O
. O

The O
seer O
blesses O
the O
sacrifice O
, O
so O
the O
people O
wo O
n't O
begin O
eating O
until O
he O
gets O
there O
. O

If O
you O
hurry O
, O
you O
can O
find O
him O
. O
'' O

Saul O
and O
the O
servant O
started O
walking O
up O
the O
hill O
to O
town O
. O

Just O
as O
they O
came O
into O
town O
, O
they O
saw O
Samuel O
coming O
out O
of O
town O
, O
walking O
toward O
them O
. O

He O
was O
on O
his O
way O
to O
the O
place O
for O
worship O
. O

The O
day O
before O
, O
the O
Lord O
had O
told O
Samuel O
, O
`` O
At O
this O
time O
tomorrow O
I O
will O
send O
a O
man O
to O
you O
. O

He O
will O
be O
from O
the O
tribe O
of O
Benjamin O
. O

You O
must O
anoint O
him O
and O
make O
him O
the O
new O
leader O
over O
my O
people O
Israel O
. O

This O
man O
will O
save O
my O
people O
from O
the O
Philistines O
. O

I O
have O
seen O
my O
people O
suffering O
, O
and O
I O
have O
heard O
their O
cries O
for O
help O
. O
'' O

When O
Samuel O
saw O
Saul O
, O
the O
Lord O
said O
to O
Samuel O
, O
`` O
This O
is O
the O
man O
I O
told O
you O
about O
. O

He O
will O
rule O
my O
people O
. O
'' O

Saul O
went O
up O
to O
a O
man O
near O
the O
gate O
to O
ask O
directions O
. O

This O
man O
just O
happened O
to O
be O
Samuel O
. O

Saul O
said O
, O
`` O
Excuse O
me O
. O

Could O
you O
tell O
me O
where O
the O
seer O
's O
house O
is O
? O
'' O

Samuel O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
the O
seer O
. O

Go O
on O
up O
ahead O
of O
me O
to O
the O
place O
for O
worship O
. O

You O
and O
your O
servant O
will O
eat O
with O
me O
today O
. O

I O
will O
let O
you O
go O
home O
tomorrow O
morning O
. O

I O
will O
answer O
all O
your O
questions O
. O

And O
do O
n't O
worry O
about O
the O
donkeys O
that O
you O
lost O
three O
days O
ago O
. O

They O
have O
been O
found O
. O

Now O
, O
there O
is O
something O
that O
everyone O
in O
Israel O
is O
looking O
for O
and O
that O
something O
is O
you O
and O
your O
family O
. O
'' O

Saul O
answered O
, O
`` O
But O
I O
am O
a O
member O
of O
the O
tribe O
of O
Benjamin O
. O

It O
is O
the O
smallest O
tribe O
in O
Israel O
. O

And O
my O
family O
is O
the O
smallest O
in O
the O
tribe O
of O
Benjamin O
. O

Why O
do O
you O
say O
Israel O
wants O
me O
? O
'' O

Then O
Samuel O
took O
Saul O
and O
his O
servant O
to O
the O
eating O
area O
. O

About O
30 O
people O
had O
been O
invited O
to O
eat O
together O
and O
share O
the O
sacrifice O
. O

Samuel O
gave O
Saul O
and O
his O
servant O
the O
most O
important O
place O
at O
the O
table O
. O

Samuel O
said O
to O
the O
cook O
, O
`` O
Bring O
the O
meat O
I O
gave O
you O
. O

It O
is O
the O
share O
I O
told O
you O
to O
save O
. O
'' O

The O
cook O
brought O
out O
the O
thigh O
and O
put O
it O
on O
the O
table O
in O
front O
of O
Saul O
. O

Samuel O
said O
, O
`` O
Eat O
the O
meat O
that O
was O
put O
in O
front O
of O
you O
. O

It O
was O
saved O
for O
you O
for O
this O
special O
time O
when O
I O
called O
the O
people O
together O
. O
'' O

So O
Saul O
ate O
with O
Samuel O
that O
day O
. O

After O
they O
finished O
eating O
, O
they O
came O
down O
from O
the O
place O
for O
worship O
and O
went O
back O
to O
town O
. O

Samuel O
made O
a O
bed O
for O
Saul O
on O
the O
roof O
, O
and O
Saul O
went O
to O
sleep O
. O

Early O
the O
next O
morning O
, O
Samuel O
shouted O
to O
Saul O
on O
the O
roof O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Get O
up O
. O

I O
will O
send O
you O
on O
your O
way O
. O
'' O

Saul O
got O
up O
and O
went O
out O
of O
the O
house O
with O
Samuel O
. O

Saul O
, O
his O
servant O
, O
and O
Samuel O
were O
walking O
together O
near O
the O
edge O
of O
town O
. O

Samuel O
said O
to O
Saul O
, O
`` O
Tell O
your O
servant O
to O
go O
on O
ahead O
of O
us O
. O

I O
have O
a O
message O
for O
you O
from O
God O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
servant O
walked O
ahead O
of O
them O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
Philistines O
had O
gathered O
all O
of O
their O
army O
camps O
at O
Aphek O
. O

The O
Israelites O
were O
camped O
by O
the O
spring O
near O
Jezreel O
. O

The O
Philistine O
rulers O
were O
marching O
in O
divisions O
of O
100 O
and O
1000 O
men O
. O

David O
and O
his O
men O
were O
at O
the O
back O
with O
Achish O
. O

The O
Philistine O
captains O
asked O
, O
`` O
What O
are O
these O
Hebrews O
doing O
here O
? O
'' O

Achish O
told O
the O
Philistine O
captains O
, O
`` O
This O
is O
David O
. O

He O
was O
one O
of O
Saul O
's O
officers O
, O
but O
he O
has O
been O
with O
me O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

I O
found O
nothing O
wrong O
in O
David O
since O
the O
time O
he O
left O
Saul O
and O
came O
to O
me O
. O
'' O

But O
the O
Philistine O
captains O
were O
angry O
with O
Achish O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Send O
him O
back O
. O

Let O
him O
go O
back O
to O
the O
city O
you O
gave O
him O
, O
but O
he O
ca O
n't O
go O
into O
battle O
with O
us O
. O

As O
long O
as O
he O
is O
here O
, O
we O
have O
an O
enemy O
in O
our O
own O
camp O
. O

He O
would O
make O
his O
king O
happy O
by O
killing O
our O
men O
. O

Is O
n't O
David O
the O
one O
the O
Israelites O
sing O
about O
? O

They O
dance O
and O
sing O
this O
song O
: O
' O
Saul O
has O
killed O
thousands O
of O
enemies O
, O
but O
David O
has O
killed O
tens O
of O
thousands O
. O
' O
'' O

So O
Achish O
called O
David O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
As O
surely O
as O
the O
Lord O
lives O
, O
you O
are O
loyal O
to O
me O
. O

I O
would O
be O
pleased O
to O
have O
you O
serve O
in O
my O
army O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
found O
anything O
wrong O
with O
you O
since O
the O
day O
you O
came O
to O
me O
. O

The O
Philistine O
rulers O
also O
think O
you O
are O
a O
good O
man O
. O

Go O
back O
in O
peace O
. O

Do O
n't O
do O
anything O
against O
the O
Philistine O
rulers O
. O
'' O

David O
asked O
, O
`` O
What O
have O
I O
done O
wrong O
? O

Have O
you O
found O
anything O
wrong O
with O
me O
since O
the O
day O
I O
came O
to O
you O
? O

So O
why O
wo O
n't O
you O
let O
me O
go O
to O
fight O
the O
enemies O
of O
my O
lord O
the O
king O
? O
'' O

Achish O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
believe O
that O
you O
are O
a O
good O
man O
. O

You O
are O
like O
an O
angel O
from O
God O
. O

But O
the O
Philistine O
captains O
still O
say O
, O
' O
David O
ca O
n't O
go O
with O
us O
into O
battle O
. O
' O

Early O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
you O
and O
your O
men O
should O
go O
back O
to O
the O
city O
I O
gave O
you O
. O

Do O
n't O
pay O
attention O
to O
the O
bad O
things O
the O
captains O
say O
about O
you O
. O

You O
are O
a O
good O
man O
, O
but O
you O
must O
leave O
as O
soon O
as O
there O
is O
enough O
light O
in O
the O
morning O
. O
'' O

So O
David O
and O
his O
men O
got O
up O
early O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
went O
back O
to O
the O
country O
of O
the O
Philistines O
, O
and O
the O
Philistines O
went O
up O
to O
Jezreel O
. O

King O
Ahab O
told O
Jezebel O
everything O
that O
Elijah O
did O
and O
how O
Elijah O
had O
killed O
all O
the O
prophets O
of O
Baal O
with O
a O
sword O
. O

So O
Jezebel O
sent O
a O
messenger O
to O
Elijah O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
swear O
that O
by O
this O
time O
tomorrow O
, O
you O
will O
be O
just O
as O
dead O
as O
those O
prophets O
. O

If O
I O
do O
n't O
succeed O
, O
may O
the O
gods O
do O
the O
same O
or O
worse O
to O
me O
. O
'' O

When O
Elijah O
heard O
this O
, O
he O
was O
afraid O
. O

So O
he O
ran O
away O
to O
save O
his O
life O
. O

He O
took O
his O
servant O
with O
him O
, O
and O
they O
went O
to O
Beersheba O
in O
Judah O
. O

Then O
Elijah O
left O
his O
servant O
in O
Beersheba O
and O
walked O
for O
a O
whole O
day O
into O
the O
desert O
. O

Then O
he O
sat O
down O
under O
a O
bush O
and O
asked O
to O
die O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
have O
had O
enough O
, O
Lord O
! O

Take O
my O
life O
. O

I O
am O
no O
better O
than O
my O
ancestors O
. O
'' O

Then O
Elijah O
lay O
down O
under O
the O
bush O
and O
went O
to O
sleep O
. O

An O
angel O
came O
to O
him O
and O
touched O
him O
. O

The O
angel O
said O
, O
`` O
Get O
up O
and O
eat O
! O
'' O

Elijah O
looked O
around O
, O
and O
by O
his O
head O
there O
was O
a O
cake O
that O
had O
been O
baked O
over O
coals O
and O
a O
jar O
of O
water O
. O

He O
ate O
and O
drank O
and O
then O
went O
back O
to O
sleep O
. O

Later O
the O
Lord O
's O
angel O
came O
to O
him O
again O
, O
touched O
him O
, O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Get O
up O
and O
eat O
! O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
, O
you O
will O
not O
be O
strong O
enough O
to O
make O
the O
long O
trip O
. O
'' O

So O
Elijah O
got O
up O
. O

He O
ate O
and O
drank O
and O
felt O
strong O
. O

Then O
Elijah O
walked O
for O
40 O
days O
and O
nights O
to O
Mount O
Horeb O
, O
the O
mountain O
of O
God O
. O

There O
Elijah O
went O
into O
a O
cave O
and O
spent O
the O
night O
. O

Then O
the O
Lord O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Elijah O
, O
why O
are O
you O
here O
? O
'' O

Elijah O
answered O
, O
`` O
Lord O
God O
All-Powerful O
, O
I O
have O
always O
served O
you O
the O
best O
I O
can O
, O
but O
the O
Israelites O
have O
broken O
their O
agreement O
with O
you O
. O

They O
destroyed O
your O
altars O
and O
killed O
your O
prophets O
. O

I O
am O
the O
only O
prophet O
left O
alive O
, O
and O
now O
they O
are O
trying O
to O
kill O
me O
! O
'' O

Then O
the O
Lord O
said O
to O
Elijah O
, O
`` O
Go O
, O
stand O
in O
front O
of O
me O
on O
the O
mountain O
. O

I O
will O
pass O
by O
you O
. O
'' O

Then O
a O
very O
strong O
wind O
blew O
. O

The O
wind O
caused O
the O
mountains O
to O
break O
apart O
. O

It O
broke O
large O
rocks O
in O
front O
of O
the O
Lord O
. O

But O
that O
wind O
was O
not O
the O
Lord O
. O

After O
that O
wind O
, O
there O
was O
an O
earthquake O
. O

But O
that O
earthquake O
was O
not O
the O
Lord O
. O

After O
the O
earthquake O
, O
there O
was O
a O
fire O
. O

But O
that O
fire O
was O
not O
the O
Lord O
. O

After O
the O
fire O
, O
there O
was O
a O
quiet O
, O
gentle O
voice O
. O

When O
Elijah O
heard O
the O
voice O
, O
he O
used O
his O
coat O
to O
cover O
his O
face O
and O
went O
to O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
cave O
and O
stood O
there O
. O

Then O
a O
voice O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Elijah O
, O
why O
are O
you O
here O
? O
'' O

Elijah O
said O
, O
`` O
Lord O
God O
All-Powerful O
, O
I O
have O
always O
served O
you O
the O
best O
that O
I O
can O
, O
but O
the O
Israelites O
broke O
their O
agreement O
with O
you O
. O

They O
destroyed O
your O
altars O
and O
killed O
your O
prophets O
. O

I O
am O
the O
only O
prophet O
left O
alive O
, O
and O
now O
they O
are O
trying O
to O
kill O
me O
. O
'' O

The O
Lord O
said O
, O
`` O
Go O
back O
. O

Take O
the O
road O
that O
leads O
to O
the O
desert O
around O
Damascus O
. O

Go O
into O
Damascus O
and O
anoint O
Hazael O
as O
king O
over O
Aram O
. O

Then O
anoint O
Jehu O
son O
of O
Nimshi O
as O
king O
over O
Israel O
. O

Next O
, O
anoint O
Elisha O
son O
of O
Shaphat O
from O
Abel O
Meholah O
. O

He O
will O
be O
the O
prophet O
who O
takes O
your O
place O
. O

Jehu O
will O
kill O
anyone O
who O
escapes O
Hazael O
's O
sword O
, O
and O
Elisha O
will O
kill O
anyone O
who O
escapes O
from O
Jehu O
's O
sword O
. O

I O
still O
have O
7000 O
people O
in O
Israel O
who O
have O
never O
bowed O
down O
to O
Baal O
or O
kissed O
that O
idol O
. O
'' O

So O
Elijah O
left O
that O
place O
and O
went O
to O
find O
Elisha O
son O
of O
Shaphat O
. O

Elisha O
was O
plowing O
12 O
acres O
of O
land O
and O
was O
working O
on O
the O
last O
acre O
when O
Elijah O
came O
. O

Elijah O
went O
to O
Elisha O
and O
put O
his O
coat O
on O
Elisha O
. O

Elisha O
immediately O
left O
his O
oxen O
and O
ran O
after O
Elijah O
. O

Elisha O
said O
, O
`` O
Let O
me O
kiss O
my O
mother O
and O
father O
goodbye O
. O

Then O
I O
will O
follow O
you O
. O
'' O

Elijah O
answered O
, O
`` O
You O
can O
do O
that O
. O

I O
will O
not O
stop O
you O
. O
'' O

Elisha O
turned O
away O
from O
him O
and O
went O
back O
. O

He O
killed O
the O
oxen O
and O
used O
the O
yoke O
for O
firewood O
. O

He O
boiled O
the O
meat O
, O
gave O
it O
to O
the O
people O
, O
and O
they O
all O
ate O
together O
. O

Then O
Elisha O
went O
to O
follow O
Elijah O
and O
became O
his O
helper O
. O

So O
Solomon O
finished O
building O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
and O
his O
own O
palace O
. O

Solomon O
built O
everything O
that O
he O
wanted O
to O
build O
. O

Then O
the O
Lord O
appeared O
to O
Solomon O
again O
, O
just O
as O
he O
did O
at O
Gibeon O
. O

The O
Lord O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
I O
heard O
your O
prayer O
and O
what O
you O
asked O
me O
to O
do O
. O

You O
built O
this O
Temple O
, O
and O
I O
have O
made O
it O
a O
holy O
place O
. O

So O
I O
will O
be O
honored O
there O
forever O
. O

I O
will O
watch O
over O
it O
and O
think O
of O
it O
always O
. O

You O
must O
serve O
me O
with O
a O
pure O
and O
honest O
heart O
, O
just O
as O
your O
father O
David O
did O
. O

You O
must O
obey O
my O
laws O
and O
do O
everything O
that O
I O
commanded O
you O
. O

If O
you O
do O
, O
I O
will O
make O
sure O
that O
your O
family O
will O
always O
rule O
Israel O
, O
just O
as O
I O
promised O
your O
father O
David O
when O
I O
told O
him O
that O
Israel O
would O
always O
be O
ruled O
by O
one O
of O
his O
descendants O
. O

`` O
But O
if O
you O
or O
your O
children O
stop O
following O
me O
, O
and O
do O
n't O
obey O
the O
laws O
and O
commands O
that O
I O
have O
given O
you O
, O
and O
if O
you O
serve O
and O
worship O
other O
gods O
, O
I O
will O
force O
Israel O
to O
leave O
the O
land O
that O
I O
have O
given O
to O
them O
. O

Israel O
will O
be O
an O
example O
to O
other O
people O
. O

Other O
people O
will O
make O
jokes O
about O
Israel O
. O

I O
made O
the O
Temple O
holy O
. O

It O
is O
the O
place O
where O
people O
honor O
me O
. O

But O
I O
will O
tear O
it O
down O
. O

This O
Temple O
will O
be O
destroyed O
. O

Everyone O
who O
sees O
it O
will O
be O
amazed O
. O

They O
will O
ask O
, O
' O
Why O
did O
the O
Lord O
do O
this O
terrible O
thing O
to O
this O
land O
and O
to O
this O
temple O
? O
' O

People O
will O
say O
, O
' O
This O
happened O
because O
they O
left O
the O
Lord O
their O
God O
. O

He O
brought O
their O
ancestors O
out O
of O
Egypt O
, O
but O
they O
decided O
to O
follow O
other O
gods O
. O

They O
began O
to O
worship O
and O
serve O
those O
gods O
. O

That O
is O
why O
the O
Lord O
caused O
all O
these O
bad O
things O
to O
happen O
to O
them O
. O
' O
'' O

It O
took O
20 O
years O
for O
King O
Solomon O
to O
build O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
and O
the O
king O
's O
palace O
. O

Hiram O
supplied O
Solomon O
with O
all O
the O
cedar O
, O
pine O
and O
gold O
that O
he O
wanted O
, O
so O
Solomon O
gave O
him O
20 O
cities O
in O
Galilee O
. O

So O
Hiram O
traveled O
from O
Tyre O
to O
see O
the O
cities O
that O
Solomon O
had O
given O
him O
. O

But O
Hiram O
was O
not O
pleased O
when O
he O
saw O
them O
. O

King O
Hiram O
said O
, O
`` O
What O
are O
these O
towns O
that O
you O
have O
given O
me O
, O
my O
brother O
? O
'' O

King O
Hiram O
named O
that O
land O
the O
Land O
of O
Cabul O
. O

And O
that O
area O
is O
still O
called O
Cabul O
today O
. O

Hiram O
had O
sent O
King O
Solomon O
about O
9000 O
pounds O
of O
gold O
to O
use O
in O
building O
the O
Temple O
. O

King O
Solomon O
forced O
slaves O
to O
work O
for O
him O
to O
build O
the O
Temple O
and O
his O
palace O
. O

Then O
he O
used O
these O
slaves O
to O
build O
many O
other O
things O
. O

He O
built O
the O
Millo O
and O
the O
city O
wall O
around O
Jerusalem O
. O

Then O
he O
rebuilt O
the O
cities O
of O
Hazor O
, O
Megiddo O
, O
and O
Gezer O
. O

In O
the O
past O
the O
king O
of O
Egypt O
had O
fought O
against O
the O
city O
of O
Gezer O
and O
burned O
it O
. O

He O
killed O
the O
Canaanites O
who O
lived O
there O
. O

When O
Solomon O
married O
Pharaoh O
's O
daughter O
, O
Pharaoh O
gave O
him O
that O
city O
as O
a O
wedding O
present O
. O

Solomon O
rebuilt O
Gezer O
and O
the O
city O
of O
Lower O
Beth O
Horon O
. O

He O
also O
built O
the O
cities O
of O
Baalath O
and O
Tamar O
in O
the O
Judean O
desert O
. O

He O
also O
built O
cities O
where O
he O
could O
store O
grain O
, O
and O
he O
built O
places O
for O
his O
chariots O
and O
his O
horses O
. O

King O
Solomon O
also O
built O
whatever O
he O
wanted O
in O
Jerusalem O
, O
Lebanon O
, O
and O
all O
the O
places O
he O
ruled O
. O

There O
were O
people O
left O
in O
the O
land O
who O
were O
not O
Israelites O
. O

There O
were O
Amorites O
, O
Hittites O
, O
Perizzites O
, O
Hivites O
, O
and O
Jebusites O
. O

The O
Israelites O
had O
not O
been O
able O
to O
destroy O
them O
, O
but O
Solomon O
forced O
them O
to O
work O
for O
him O
as O
slaves O
. O

They O
are O
still O
slaves O
today O
. O

Solomon O
did O
not O
force O
any O
Israelites O
to O
be O
his O
slaves O
. O

The O
Israelites O
were O
soldiers O
, O
government O
officials O
, O
officers O
, O
captains O
, O
and O
chariot O
commanders O
and O
drivers O
. O

There O
were O
550 O
supervisors O
over O
Solomon O
's O
projects O
. O

They O
supervised O
the O
men O
who O
did O
the O
work O
. O

Pharaoh O
's O
daughter O
moved O
from O
the O
City O
of O
David O
to O
the O
palace O
that O
Solomon O
had O
built O
for O
her O
. O

Then O
he O
built O
the O
Millo O
. O

Three O
times O
each O
year O
Solomon O
offered O
burned O
sacrifices O
and O
fellowship O
offerings O
on O
the O
altar O
that O
he O
built O
for O
the O
Lord O
. O

King O
Solomon O
also O
burned O
incense O
before O
the O
Lord O
and O
supplied O
what O
was O
needed O
for O
the O
Temple O

King O
Solomon O
also O
built O
ships O
at O
Ezion O
Geber O
. O

This O
town O
is O
near O
Elath O
on O
the O
shore O
of O
the O
Red O
Sea O
, O
in O
the O
land O
of O
Edom O
. O

King O
Hiram O
had O
some O
skilled O
sailors O
who O
knew O
the O
sea O
well O
. O

He O
sent O
them O
to O
serve O
in O
Solomon O
's O
navy O
and O
work O
with O
Solomon O
's O
men O
. O

Solomon O
's O
ships O
went O
to O
Ophir O
and O
brought O
back O
about O
16 O
tons O
of O
gold O
for O
him O
. O

When O
King O
Hezekiah O
heard O
this O
, O
he O
tore O
his O
clothes O
to O
show O
he O
was O
upset O
. O

Then O
he O
put O
on O
sackcloth O
and O
went O
to O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
. O

Hezekiah O
sent O
Eliakim O
the O
palace O
manager O
, O
Shebna O
the O
royal O
secretary O
, O
and O
the O
elders O
of O
the O
priests O
to O
the O
prophet O
Isaiah O
son O
of O
Amoz O
. O

They O
wore O
the O
special O
clothes O
that O
showed O
they O
were O
sad O
and O
upset O
. O

They O
said O
to O
Isaiah O
, O
`` O
King O
Hezekiah O
has O
commanded O
that O
today O
will O
be O
a O
special O
day O
for O
sorrow O
and O
sadness O
. O

It O
will O
be O
a O
very O
sad O
day O
, O
like O
the O
time O
a O
child O
should O
be O
born O
, O
but O
is O
not O
strong O
enough O
to O
come O
from O
its O
mother O
's O
womb O
. O

The O
commander O
's O
master O
, O
the O
king O
of O
Assyria O
, O
has O
sent O
him O
to O
say O
bad O
things O
about O
the O
living O
God O
. O

Maybe O
the O
Lord O
your O
God O
will O
hear O
all O
those O
things O
. O

Maybe O
he O
will O
prove O
the O
enemy O
is O
wrong O
! O

So O
pray O
for O
the O
people O
who O
are O
still O
left O
alive O
. O
'' O

King O
Hezekiah O
's O
officers O
went O
to O
Isaiah O
. O

Isaiah O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
Give O
this O
message O
to O
your O
master O
, O
Hezekiah O
: O
The O
Lord O

, O

Do O
n't O
be O
afraid O
of O
what O
you O

from O

commanders O

Do O
n't O
believe O
what O
those O
`` O
boys O
'' O
from O
the O
king O
of O
Assyria O
said O
to O
make O
fun O
of O
me O

Look O
, O
I O
will O
send O
a O
spirit O
against O
the O
king O
of O
Assyria O
. O

He O
will O
get O
a O
report O
warning O
him O
about O
a O
danger O
, O
so O
he O
will O
return O
to O
his O
own O
country O

And O
I O
will O
cut O
him O
down O
with O
a O
sword O
in O
his O
own O
country O

' O
'' O

The O
commander O
heard O
that O
the O
king O
of O
Assyria O
had O
left O
Lachish O
. O

He O
found O
him O
at O
Libnah O
, O
fighting O
against O
that O
city O
. O

Then O
the O
king O
of O
Assyria O
heard O
a O
report O
that O
said O
, O
`` O
Tirhakah O
, O
the O
king O
of O
Ethiopia O
, O
has O
come O
to O
fight O
against O
you O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
king O
of O
Assyria O
sent O
messengers O
to O
Hezekiah O
again O
. O

He O
told O
them O
, O
`` O
Tell O
King O

he O
says O
Jerusalem O

not O
be O
defeated O
by O
the O
king O
of O
Assyria O

You O
have O
heard O
what O
the O
kings O
of O
Assyria O
did O
to O
all O
the O
other O
countries O
. O

We O
completely O
destroyed O
them O
! O

Will O
you O
be O
saved O
? O

No O
! O

Did O
the O
gods O
of O
those O
nations O
save O
their O
people O
? O

No O
, O
my O
ancestors O
destroyed O
them O
all O

They O
destroyed O

Haran O
, O
Rezeph O

the O

'' O

Hezekiah O
received O
the O
letters O
from O
the O
messengers O
and O
read O
them O
. O

Then O
he O
went O
up O
to O
the O
Lord O
's O
Temple O
and O
laid O
the O
letters O
out O
in O
front O
of O
the O
Lord O
. O

Hezekiah O
prayed O
before O
the O
Lord O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Lord O

God O

open O

this O

Hear O
the O
words O
that O
Sennacherib O
sent O
to O
insult O
the O
living O
God O

It O
is O
true O
, O
Lord O

The O
kings O
of O
Assyria O
did O
destroy O
all O
those O
nations O

They O
did O
throw O
the O
gods O
of O
those O
nations O
into O
the O
fire O

But O
they O
were O
not O
real O
gods O

They O
were O
only O
wood O

stone O

statues O
that O
people O

That O
is O
why O
the O
kings O

could O
destroy O
them O

you O
are O
the O
Lord O
our O
God O

please O
save O
us O

all O

know O
that O
you O

God O

Then O
Isaiah O
son O
of O
Amoz O
sent O
this O
message O
to O
Hezekiah O

Isaiah O
said O
, O
`` O
The O

Who O

you O

You O
were O
against O

Holy O

You O
acted O

better O

You O
sent O
your O

I O

from O
ancient O

I O
planned O
it O

And O
now O
I O
have O
made O
it O
happen O

I O
let O
you O
tear O
down O
the O
strong O
cities O

change O
them O
into O
piles O
of O
rocks O

The O
people O
in O
the O
cities O
had O
no O
power O

They O
were O
afraid O

confused O

They O
were O
about O
to O
be O
cut O
down O
like O

They O
were O

dying O

I O
know O
all O

I O

I O
will O
turn O
you O
around O

you O
back O

Then O
the O
Lord O
said O

`` O
I O

give O
you O
a O

these O

in O
the O

you O

The O
people O
from O
the O
family O
of O
Judah O
who O
have O
escaped O

left O
alive O

their O
roots O
deep O
into O
the O
ground O

produce O

above O

That O
is O

a O

will O
come O
out O

Jerusalem O
alive O

There O
will O
be O
survivors O
coming O
from O
Mount O
Zion O

The O
strong O

I O
will O
do O
this O
for O

That O
night O
the O
angel O
of O
the O
Lord O
went O
out O
and O
killed O
185,000 O
people O
in O
the O
Assyrian O
camp O

When O
the O
others O
got O
up O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
they O
saw O
all O
the O
dead O
bodies O

So O
King O
Sennacherib O
of O
Assyria O
left O
and O
went O
back O
to O
Nineveh O
where O
he O
stayed O

One O
day O
Sennacherib O
was O
in O
the O
temple O
of O
his O
god O
Nisroch O
, O
worshiping O
him O

His O
sons O
Adrammelech O
and O
Sharezer O
killed O
him O
with O
a O
sword O
and O
ran O
away O
to O
Ararat O

So O
his O
son O
Esarhaddon O
became O
the O
new O
king O
of O
Assyria O
. O

Elisha O
the O
prophet O
called O
one O
of O
the O
men O
from O
the O
group O
of O
prophets O
and O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Get O

take O

When O
you O

find O
Jehu O

Then O
go O
in O

up O

Take O
him O

Then O
open O
the O

run O
away O

Do O

So O
this O
young O

went O
to O
Ramoth O
Gilead O

When O
the O
young O

he O
saw O
the O
captains O
of O

army O
sitting O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Captain O

I O
have O
a O

Jehu O
asked O

`` O
Which O

The O
young O
man O
said O

`` O
For O
you O

Jehu O
got O
up O

the O
house O

the O
young O

You O
must O
destroy O

In O

the O

all O

will O
not O

any O

if O
that O

a O
slave O

I O
will O
make O

of O
Jeroboam O
son O
of O
Nebat O

like O

Then O
the O

prophet O
opened O
the O
door O

ran O
away O

Jehu O
went O
back O
to O
his O
king O

officers O

One O
of O
the O
officers O
said O
to O
Jehu O

`` O
Is O
everything O
all O
right O

Why O
did O
this O
crazy O
man O
come O

Jehu O
answered O
the O

`` O
You O

Then O
each O

quickly O
took O
his O

off O

put O
it O
on O
the O

So O
Jehu O
son O
of O
Jehoshaphat O
, O
son O
of O
Nimshi O
, O
made O
plans O
against O
Joram O
. O

At O
that O
time O
Joram O
and O
the O
Israelites O
had O
been O
trying O
to O
defend O
Ramoth O
Gilead O
from O
King O
Hazael O
of O
Aram O
. O

King O
Joram O
had O
fought O
against O
King O
Hazael O
of O
Aram O
. O

But O
the O
Arameans O
wounded O
King O
Joram O
, O
and O
he O
went O
to O
Jezreel O
to O
get O
well O
from O
those O
injuries O
. O

So O
Jehu O
told O
the O
officers O
, O
`` O
If O
you O
agree O
that O
I O
am O
the O
new O
king O
, O
do O
n't O
let O
anyone O
escape O
from O
the O
city O
to O
tell O
the O
news O
in O
Jezreel O
. O
'' O

Joram O
was O
resting O
in O
Jezreel O
, O
so O
Jehu O
got O
in O
his O
chariot O
and O
drove O
to O
Jezreel O
. O

King O
Ahaziah O
of O
Judah O
had O
also O
come O
to O
Jezreel O
to O
see O
Joram O
. O

A O
guard O
was O
standing O
on O
the O
tower O
in O
Jezreel O
. O

He O
saw O
Jehu O
's O
large O
group O
coming O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
see O
a O
large O
group O
of O
people O
! O
'' O

Joram O
said O
, O
`` O
Send O
someone O
on O
a O
horse O
to O
meet O
them O
. O

Tell O
this O
messenger O
to O
ask O
if O
they O
come O
in O
peace O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
messenger O
rode O
on O
a O
horse O
to O
meet O
Jehu O
. O

The O
messenger O
said O
, O
`` O
King O
Joram O
says O
, O
' O
Do O
you O
come O
in O
peace O
? O
' O
'' O

Jehu O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
have O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
peace O
. O

Come O
and O
follow O
me O
. O
'' O

The O
guard O
told O
Joram O
, O
`` O
The O
messenger O
went O
to O
the O
group O
, O
but O
he O
has O
not O
come O
back O
yet O
. O
'' O

Then O
Joram O
sent O
out O
a O
second O
messenger O
on O
a O
horse O
. O

This O
man O
came O
to O
Jehu O
's O
group O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
King O
Joram O
says O
, O
' O
Peace O
. O
' O
'' O

Jehu O
answered O
, O
`` O
You O
have O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
peace O
. O

Come O
and O
follow O
me O
. O
'' O

The O
guard O
told O
Joram O
, O
`` O
The O
second O
messenger O
went O
to O
the O
group O
, O
but O
he O
has O
not O
come O
back O
yet O
. O

There O
is O
a O
man O
driving O
his O
chariot O
like O
a O
mad O
man O
. O

He O
is O
driving O
like O
Jehu O
son O
of O
Nimshi O
. O
'' O

Joram O
said O
, O
`` O
Get O
me O
my O
chariot O
! O
'' O

So O
the O
servant O
got O
Joram O
's O
chariot O
. O

Both O
King O
Joram O
of O
Israel O
and O
King O
Ahaziah O
of O
Judah O
got O
their O
chariots O
and O
drove O
out O
to O
meet O
Jehu O
. O

They O
met O
him O
at O
the O
property O
of O
Naboth O
from O
Jezreel O
. O

Joram O
saw O
Jehu O
and O
asked O
, O
`` O
Do O
you O
come O
in O
peace O
, O
Jehu O
? O
'' O

Jehu O
answered O
, O
`` O
There O
is O
no O
peace O
as O
long O
as O
your O
mother O
Jezebel O
does O
many O
acts O
of O
prostitution O
and O
witchcraft O
. O
'' O

Joram O
turned O
the O
horses O
to O
run O
away O
. O

He O
said O
to O
Ahaziah O
, O
`` O
It O
is O
a O
trick O
, O
Ahaziah O
! O
'' O

But O
Jehu O
grabbed O
his O
bow O
and O
shot O
Joram O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
his O
back O
, O
through O
the O
heart O
. O

Joram O
fell O
dead O
in O
his O
chariot O
. O

Jehu O
said O
to O
his O
chariot O
driver O
Bidkar O
, O
`` O
Take O
Joram O
's O
body O
up O
and O
throw O
it O
into O
the O
field O
of O
Naboth O
from O
Jezreel O
. O

Remember O
when O
you O
and O
I O
rode O
together O
with O
Joram O
's O
father O
Ahab O
, O
the O
Lord O
said O
this O
would O
happen O
to O
him O
. O

The O
Lord O
said O
, O
' O
Yesterday O
I O
saw O
the O
blood O
of O
Naboth O
and O
his O
sons O
. O

So O
I O
will O
punish O
Ahab O
in O
this O
field O
. O
' O

The O
Lord O
said O
that O
. O

So O
take O
Joram O
's O
body O
and O
throw O
it O
into O
the O
field O
, O
just O
as O
he O
said O
. O
'' O

King O
Ahaziah O
of O
Judah O
saw O
this O
and O
ran O
away O
. O

He O
tried O
to O
escape O
through O
the O
garden O
house O
, O
but O
Jehu O
followed O
him O
. O

Jehu O
had O
said O
, O
`` O
Shoot O
Ahaziah O
too O
! O
'' O

Ahaziah O
was O
wounded O
when O
he O
was O
in O
his O
chariot O
on O
the O
road O
to O
Gur O
near O
Ibleam O
. O

He O
got O
as O
far O
as O
Megiddo O
, O
but O
he O
died O
there O
. O

Ahaziah O
's O
servants O
carried O
his O
body O
in O
the O
chariot O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

They O
buried O
him O
in O
his O
tomb O
with O
his O
ancestors O
in O
the O
City O
of O
David O
. O

Ahaziah O
had O
become O
king O
over O
Judah O
during O
Joram O
's O
eleventh O
year O
as O
king O
of O
Israel O
. O

When O
Jehu O
came O
to O
Jezreel O
, O
Jezebel O
heard O
the O
news O
. O

She O
put O
her O
makeup O
on O
and O
fixed O
her O
hair O
. O

Then O
she O
stood O
by O
the O
window O
and O
looked O
out O
. O

Jehu O
entered O
the O
city O
. O

Jezebel O
said O
, O
`` O
Hello O
, O
you O
Zimri O
. O

You O
killed O
your O
master O
just O
as O
he O
did O
. O
'' O

Jehu O
looked O
up O
at O
the O
window O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Who O
is O
on O
my O
side O
? O

Who O
? O
'' O

Two O
or O
three O
eunuchs O
looked O
out O
at O
Jehu O
. O

Jehu O
said O
, O
`` O
Throw O
Jezebel O
down O
! O
'' O

Then O
the O
eunuchs O
threw O
her O
down O
. O

Some O
of O
her O
blood O
splashed O
on O
the O
wall O
and O
on O
the O
horses O
that O
trampled O
her O
body O
. O

Jehu O
went O
into O
the O
house O
and O
ate O
and O
drank O
. O

Then O
he O
said O
, O
`` O
Now O
see O
about O
this O
cursed O
woman O
. O

Bury O
her O
, O
because O
she O
is O
a O
king O
's O
daughter O
. O
'' O

The O
men O
went O
to O
bury O
Jezebel O
, O
but O
they O
could O
not O
find O
her O
body O
. O

They O
could O
only O
find O
her O
skull O
, O
her O
feet O
, O
and O
the O
palms O
of O
her O
hands O
. O

When O
the O
men O
came O
back O
and O
told O
Jehu O
, O
he O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
Lord O
told O
his O
servant O
Elijah O
the O
Tishbite O
to O
give O
this O
message O
: O
' O
Dogs O
will O
eat O
the O
body O
of O
Jezebel O
in O
the O
area O
of O
Jezreel O

Her O
body O
will O
be O
like O
dung O
on O
the O
field O
in O
the O
area O
of O
Jezreel O
. O

No O
one O
will O
be O
able O
to O
recognize O
her O
body O
! O
' O
'' O

David O
asked O
, O
`` O
Is O
there O
anyone O
still O
left O
in O
Saul O
's O
family O
? O

I O
want O
to O
show O
kindness O
to O
this O
person O
. O

I O
want O
to O
do O
it O
for O
Jonathan O
. O
'' O

There O
was O
a O
servant O
named O
Ziba O
from O
Saul O
's O
family O
. O

David O
's O
servants O
called O
Ziba O
to O
David O
. O

King O
David O
said O
to O
Ziba O
, O
`` O
Are O
you O
Ziba O
? O
'' O

Ziba O
said O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
I O
am O
your O
servant O
Ziba O
. O
'' O

The O
king O
said O
, O
`` O
Is O
there O
anyone O
left O
in O
Saul O
's O
family O
? O

I O
want O
to O
show O
God O
's O
kindness O
to O
this O
person O
. O
'' O

Ziba O
said O
to O
King O
David O
, O
`` O
Jonathan O
has O
a O
son O
still O
living O
. O

He O
is O
crippled O
in O
both O
feet O
. O
'' O

The O
king O
said O
to O
Ziba O
, O
`` O
Where O
is O
this O
son O
? O
'' O

Ziba O
said O
to O
the O
king O
, O
`` O
He O
is O
at O
the O
house O
of O
Makir O
son O
of O
Ammiel O
in O
Lo O
Debar O
. O
'' O

Then O
King O
David O
sent O
some O
of O
his O
officers O
to O
Lo O
Debar O
to O
bring O
Jonathan O
's O
son O
from O
the O
house O
of O
Makir O
son O
of O
Ammiel O
. O

Jonathan O
's O
son O
Mephibosheth O
came O
to O
David O
and O
bowed O
with O
his O
face O
low O
to O
the O
floor O
. O

David O
said O
, O
`` O
Mephibosheth O
? O
'' O

Mephibosheth O
said O
, O
`` O
Yes O
sir O
, O
it O
is O
I O
, O
your O
servant O
Mephibosheth O
. O
'' O

David O
said O
to O
Mephibosheth O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
be O
afraid O
. O

I O
will O
be O
kind O
to O
you O
because O
of O
your O
father O
Jonathan O
. O

I O
will O
give O
back O
to O
you O
all O
the O
land O
of O
your O
grandfather O
Saul O
. O

And O
you O
will O
always O
be O
able O
to O
eat O
at O
my O
table O
. O
'' O

Mephibosheth O
bowed O
to O
David O
again O
and O
he O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
no O
better O
than O
a O
dead O
dog O
, O
but O
you O
are O
being O
very O
kind O
to O
me O
. O
'' O

Then O
King O
David O
called O
Saul O
's O
servant O
Ziba O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
have O
given O
Saul O
's O
family O
and O
everything O
he O
owns O
to O
your O
master O
's O
grandson O
, O
Mephibosheth O
. O

You O
will O
farm O
the O
land O
for O
Mephibosheth O
. O

Your O
sons O
and O
servants O
will O
do O
this O
for O
him O
. O

You O
will O
harvest O
the O
crops O
. O

Then O
your O
master O
's O
grandson O
will O
have O
plenty O
of O
food O
to O
eat O
, O
but O
Mephibosheth O
will O
always O
be O
allowed O
to O
eat O
at O
my O
table O
. O
'' O

Ziba O
had O
15 O
sons O
and O
20 O
servants O
. O

He O
said O
to O
King O
David O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
your O
servant O
. O

I O
will O
do O
everything O
that O
my O
lord O
the O
king O
commands O
. O
'' O

So O
Mephibosheth O
ate O
at O
David O
's O
table O
like O
one O
of O
the O
king O
's O
sons O
. O

Mephibosheth O
had O
a O
young O
son O
named O
Mica O
. O

All O
the O
people O
in O
Ziba O
's O
family O
became O
Mephibosheth O
's O
servants O
. O

Mephibosheth O
lived O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

He O
was O
crippled O
in O
both O
feet O
, O
and O
every O
day O
he O
ate O
at O
the O
king O
's O
table O
. O

People O
told O
Joab O
what O
had O
happened O
, O
`` O
Look O
, O
the O
king O
is O
crying O
and O
mourning O
for O
Absalom O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
joy O
of O
victory O
turned O
to O
sadness O
for O
everyone O
. O

It O
was O
a O
very O
sad O
day O
because O
the O
people O
heard O
, O
`` O
The O
king O
is O
mourning O
for O
his O
son O
. O
'' O

The O
people O
came O
into O
the O
city O
quietly O
as O
if O
they O
were O
the O
ones O
who O
had O
been O
defeated O
in O
battle O
. O

The O
king O
had O
covered O
his O
face O
and O
was O
crying O
loudly O
, O
`` O
O O
my O
son O
Absalom O
, O
O O
Absalom O
, O
my O
son O
, O
my O
son O
! O
'' O

Joab O
came O
into O
the O
king O
's O
palace O
and O
said O
to O
the O
king O
, O
`` O
You O
are O
humiliating O
every O
one O
of O
your O
officers O
! O

Look O
, O
they O
saved O
your O
life O
today O
and O
the O
lives O
of O
your O
sons O
and O
daughters O
and O
your O
wives O
and O
slave O
women O
. O

It O
seems O
that O
you O
love O
those O
who O
hate O
you O
, O
and O
you O
hate O
those O
who O
love O
you O
! O

Today O
you O
have O
made O
it O
clear O
to O
your O
officers O
and O
men O
that O
they O
mean O
nothing O
to O
you O
. O

It O
appears O
as O
if O
you O
would O
have O
been O
perfectly O
happy O
if O
Absalom O
had O
lived O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
had O
been O
killed O
today O
! O

Now O
get O
up O
and O
go O
encourage O
your O
officers O
. O

I O
swear O
by O
the O
Lord O
, O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
go O
out O
and O
do O
that O
right O
now O
, O
not O
one O
man O
will O
be O
with O
you O
tonight O
. O

And O
that O
will O
be O
worse O
for O
you O
than O
all O
the O
trouble O
you O
have O
had O
since O
you O
were O
a O
child O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
king O
went O
to O
the O
city O
gate O
. O

The O
news O
spread O
that O
the O
king O
was O
at O
the O
gate O
, O
so O
all O
the O
people O
came O
to O
see O
him O
, O
except O
for O
the O
Israelites O
who O
had O
run O
away O
to O
their O
homes O
. O

The O
tribes O
of O
Israel O
began O
discussing O
what O
to O
do O
next O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
King O
David O
saved O
us O
from O
the O
Philistines O
and O
our O
other O
enemies O
. O

David O
left O
the O
country O
because O
he O
was O
running O
away O
from O
Absalom O
. O

We O
anointed O
Absalom O
to O
be O
the O
king O
, O
but O
he O
was O
killed O
in O
battle O
. O

So O
we O
should O
bring O
David O
back O
to O
be O
the O
king O
again O
. O
'' O

King O
David O
sent O
a O
message O
to O
Zadok O
and O
Abiathar O
the O
priests O
. O

David O
said O
, O
`` O
Speak O
to O
the O
leaders O
of O
Judah O
and O
tell O
them O
, O
' O
Why O
are O
you O
the O
last O
tribe O
to O
bring O
King O
David O
back O
home O

See O
, O
all O
the O
Israelites O
are O
talking O
about O
bringing O
the O
king O
back O
home O

You O
are O
my O
brothers O

so O
why O
are O
you O
the O
last O
tribe O
to O
bring O
the O
king O

' O

Also O
tell O
Amasa O

' O
You O

that O
I O
will O
make O
you O
captain O

the O
army O
in O
Joab O

place O

' O
'' O

David O
touched O
the O
hearts O
of O
the O
people O
of O
Judah O
, O
and O
they O
all O
agreed O
as O
one O
. O

The O
people O
of O
Judah O
sent O
a O
message O
to O
the O
king O
, O
saying O
, O
`` O
You O

all O
your O
officers O

back O

King O
David O
came O
to O
the O
Jordan O
River O

The O
people O
of O
Judah O
came O
to O
Gilgal O
to O
meet O
the O
king O

take O
him O
across O
the O
Jordan O
River O

Shimei O
son O

Gera O

from O
the O
tribe O

lived O
in O
Bahurim O

Shimei O
rushed O
down O
to O
meet O
King O

with O
the O
rest O

About O
1000 O

All O
these O

The O

They O

While O

, O
Shimei O
son O
of O
Gera O
came O

meet O
him O
. O

He O
bowed O
down O
to O
the O
ground O
in O
front O
of O
the O
king O
. O

Shimei O
said O
to O
the O
king O
, O
`` O
My O
lord O
, O
do O
n't O
think O
about O
the O
wrong O
things O

My O

and O
king O
, O
do O
n't O
remember O
the O
bad O
things O
I O
did O
when O
you O
left O
Jerusalem O
. O

I O
know O
that O
I O
sinned O
. O

That O
is O
why O
today O
I O
am O
the O
first O
person O
from O
Joseph O

family O
to O
come O
down O
and O
meet O
you O

my O
lord O

Abishai O
son O

Zeruiah O
said O
, O
`` O
Let O

kill O
him O
for O
all O
the O
bad O
things O
he O
said O
about O
the O
Lord O

chosen O
king O
. O
'' O

David O
said O
, O
`` O
What O
should O
I O
do O
with O
you O
, O
sons O
of O
Zeruiah O
? O

Are O
you O
trying O
to O
cause O
me O
trouble O
? O

No O
one O
will O
be O
put O
to O
death O
in O
Israel O
today O
! O

Today O
I O
know O
that O
I O
am O
king O
over O
Israel O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
king O
said O
to O
Shimei O
, O
`` O
You O
will O
not O
die O
. O
'' O

The O
king O
made O
a O
promise O
to O
Shimei O
that O
he O
himself O
would O
not O
kill O
Shimei O
. O

Saul O
's O
grandson O
, O
Mephibosheth O
, O
came O
down O
to O
meet O
King O
David O
. O

Mephibosheth O
had O
not O
cared O
for O
his O
feet O
, O
trimmed O
his O
mustache O
, O
or O
washed O
his O
clothes O
since O
the O
day O
the O
king O
left O
Jerusalem O
. O

When O
he O
met O
the O
king O
at O
Jerusalem O
, O
the O
king O
said O
, O
`` O
Mephibosheth O
, O
why O
did O
n't O
you O
go O
with O
me O
when O
I O
ran O
away O
from O
Jerusalem O
? O
'' O

Mephibosheth O
answered O
, O
`` O
My O
lord O
and O
king O
, O
my O
servant O
tricked O
me O
. O

I O
am O
crippled O
so O
I O
said O
to O
my O
servant O
, O
Ziba O
, O
' O
Go O
saddle O
a O
donkey O
for O
me O
so O
that O
I O
can O
go O
with O
the O
king O
. O
' O

But O
my O
servant O
tricked O
me O
and O
said O
bad O
things O
about O
me O
. O

My O
lord O
and O
king O
, O
you O
are O
like O
an O
angel O
from O
God O
. O

Do O
whatever O
you O
think O
is O
right O
. O

You O
could O
have O
killed O
all O
my O
grandfather O
's O
family O
, O
but O
you O
did O
not O
do O
that O
. O

Instead O
, O
you O
included O
me O
among O
the O
people O
who O
eat O
at O
your O
own O
table O
. O

So O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
right O
to O
complain O
to O
the O
king O
about O
anything O
. O
'' O

The O
king O
said O
to O
Mephibosheth O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
say O
anything O
more O
about O
your O
problems O
. O

This O
is O
what O
I O
have O
decided O
: O
You O
and O
Ziba O
will O
divide O
the O
land O
. O
'' O

Mephibosheth O
said O
to O
the O
king O
, O
`` O
My O
lord O
and O
king O
, O
it O
is O
enough O
that O
you O
have O
come O
home O
in O
peace O
. O

Let O
Ziba O
have O
the O
land O
. O
'' O

Barzillai O
of O
Gilead O
came O
down O
from O
Rogelim O
to O
cross O
the O
Jordan O
River O
with O
King O
David O
and O
send O
him O
on O
his O
way O
home O
. O

Barzillai O
was O
a O
very O
old O
man O
, O
80 O
years O
old O
. O

He O
had O
given O
the O
king O
food O
and O
other O
things O
when O
David O
was O
staying O
at O
Mahanaim O
. O

Barzillai O
could O
do O
this O
because O
he O
was O
a O
very O
rich O
man O
. O

David O
said O
to O
Barzillai O
, O
`` O
Come O
across O
the O
river O
with O
me O
. O

I O
will O
take O
care O
of O
you O
if O
you O
will O
live O
in O
Jerusalem O
with O
me O
. O
'' O

But O
Barzillai O
said O
to O
the O
king O
, O
`` O
Do O
you O
know O
how O
old O
I O
am O
? O

Do O
you O
think O
I O
can O
go O
with O
you O
to O
Jerusalem O
? O

I O
am O
80 O
years O
old O
! O

I O
am O
too O
old O
to O
tell O
what O
is O
bad O
or O
good O
. O

I O
can O
not O
taste O
what O
I O
eat O
or O
drink O
or O
hear O
the O
voices O
of O
men O
and O
women O
singers O
. O

Why O
should O
you O
want O
to O
be O
bothered O
with O
me O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
need O
any O
of O
the O
things O
that O
you O
want O
to O
give O
me O
. O

I O
will O
cross O
the O
Jordan O
River O
with O
you O
. O

Then O
please O
let O
me O
go O
back O
so O
that O
I O
can O
die O
in O
my O
own O
town O
and O
be O
buried O
in O
the O
grave O
of O
my O
father O
and O
mother O
. O

But O
here O
is O
Kimham O
; O
take O
him O
back O
with O
you O
as O
a O
servant O
, O
my O
lord O
and O
king O
. O

Do O
whatever O
you O
want O
with O
him O
. O
'' O

The O
king O
answered O
, O
`` O
Kimham O
will O
go O
back O
with O
me O
. O

I O
will O
be O
kind O
to O
him O
for O
you O
. O

I O
will O
do O
anything O
for O
you O
. O
'' O

The O
king O
kissed O
Barzillai O
and O
blessed O
him O
. O

Barzillai O
went O
back O
home O
, O
and O
the O
king O
and O
all O
the O
people O
went O
across O
the O
river O
. O

The O
king O
crossed O
the O
Jordan O
River O
to O
Gilgal O
. O

Kimham O
went O
with O
him O
. O

All O
the O
people O
of O
Judah O
and O
half O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
led O
David O
across O
the O
river O
. O

All O
the O
Israelites O
came O
to O
the O
king O
and O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Why O
did O
our O
brothers O
, O
the O
people O
of O
Judah O
, O
steal O
you O
away O
? O

Why O
did O
they O
bring O
you O
and O
your O
family O
back O
across O
the O
Jordan O
River O
with O
your O
men O
? O
'' O

All O
the O
people O
of O
Judah O
answered O
the O
Israelites O
, O
`` O
We O
did O
it O
because O
the O
king O
is O
our O
close O
relative O
. O

Why O
are O
you O
angry O
with O
us O
about O
this O
? O

We O
have O
not O
eaten O
food O
at O
the O
king O
's O
expense O
. O

The O
king O
did O
not O
give O
us O
any O
gifts O
. O
'' O

The O
Israelites O
answered O
, O
`` O
We O
have O
ten O
shares O
in O
David O
, O
so O
we O
have O
more O
right O
to O
David O
than O
you O
do O
. O

Why O
did O
you O
ignore O
us O
? O

We O
were O
the O
first O
ones O
to O
talk O
about O
bringing O
our O
king O
back O
. O
'' O

But O
the O
people O
of O
Judah O
replied O
with O
words O
that O
were O
even O
louder O
and O
angrier O
than O
those O
of O
the O
Israelites O
. O
