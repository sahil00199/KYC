Well O
, O
Professor O
Ji B-PERSON
, O
uh O
, O
what O
position O
and O
task O
has O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
brought O
with O
it O
when O
it O
came O
to O
participate O
in O
the O
six B-QUANTITY
- O
party O
talks O
this O
time O
. O

I O
think O
, O
this O
, O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
's I-GPE
consideration O
may O
include O
such O
two B-QUANTITY
perspectives O
, O
eh O
, O
the O
short O
- O
term O
and O
the O
long O
- O
term O
considerations O
, O

From O
the O
short O
- O
term O
perspective O
, O
eh O
, O
it O
still O
mainly O
wants O
to O
relieve O
its O
current O
pressure O
and O
resolve O
the O
issue O
of O
the O
two B-QUANTITY
sanctions O
. O

One O
is O
the O
US B-NORP
financial O
sanctions O
; O
the O
other O
is O
the O
sanctions O
imposed O
by O
the B-LAW
UN I-LAW
Security I-LAW
Council I-LAW
Resolution I-LAW
1718 I-LAW
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Well O
, O
from O
the O
long O
- O
term O
perspective O
, O
the O
purpose O
, O
um O
, O
of O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
's I-GPE
participation O
in O
the O
six B-QUANTITY
- O
party O
talks O
, O
eh O
, O
is O
also O
to O
resolve O
issues O
of O
its O
concern O
through O
the O
process O
, O
eh O
, O
of O
denuclearization O
of O
the O
peninsula O
. O

This O
, O
there O
may O
be O
, O
er O
, O
quite O
a O
number O
of O
concerns O
, O
yet O
the O
most O
important O
one O
remains O
the O
security O
concern O
, O
an O
issue O
of O
its O
relations O
with O
the O
US B-GPE
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Well O
, O
what O
needs O
to O
be O
emphasized O
here O
is O
that O
prior O
to O
, O
this O
, O
this O
session O
of O
talks O
, O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
has O
repeatedly O
stressed O
that O
it O
is O
already O
a O
nuclear O
country O
now O
. O

So O
in O
the O
future O
, O
the O
issue O
of O
the O
nuclear O
- O
free O
peninsula O
, O
uh O
, O
will O
not O
be O
merely O
an O
issue O
of O
, O
this O
, O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
's I-GPE
nuclear O
abandonment O
itself O
but O
will O
also O
include O
the O
issue O
of O
disarmament O
on O
the O
entire O
peninsula O
. O

Yeah O
. O

Recently O
I O
've O
had O
a O
, O
ah O
, O
feeling O
. O

You O
know O
I O
was O
doing O
that O
Inside O
Big B-ORG
Cases I-ORG
program O
, O
right O
. O

Yeah O
. O

Yeah O
. O

Oh O
, O
my O
lord O
! O

always O
talking O
about O
these O
weird O
cases O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
it O
's O
possible O
that O
, O
this O
, O
the O
news O
media O
, O
uh O
, O
this O
, O
would O
deliberately O
search O
for O
murder O
, O
violence O
, O
and O
pornography O
. O

Looking O
for O
the O
extraordinary O
. O

But O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
I O
would O
say O
that O
any O
of O
the O
cases O
they O
found O
, O
any O
single O
one O
, O
would O
still O
definitely O
make O
a O
big O
news O
story O
causing O
a O
sensation O
across O
the O
country O
, O
even O
if O
it O
happened O
in O
the O
US B-GPE
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Why O
were O
there O
so O
many O
. O

For O
example O
, O
psycho O
serial O
killers O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

I O
tell O
you O
, O
at O
the O
peak O
I O
had O
head O
about O
almost O
three B-QUANTITY
or O
four B-QUANTITY
cases O
a O
month O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

What O
was O
it O
all O
about O
. O

Killing O
people O
by O
the O
dozen B-QUANTITY
, O
raping O
the O
corpses O
, O
dismember O
the O
bodies O
, O
and O
dumping O
the O
bodies O
, O
they O
were O
mostly O
all O
the O
same O
kind O
of O
thing O
. O

But O
there O
were O
n't O
many O
in O
mainland O
China B-GPE
who O
killed O
their O
family O
members O
, O
were O
there O
. O

They O
killed O
other O
people O
. O

There O
were O
very O
few O
who O
actually O
killed O
their O
own O
wives O
and O
children O
or O
entire O
families O
at O
home O
. O

Er O
. O

There O
were O
those O
who O
killed O
their O
own O
relatives O
, O
uh-huh O
. O

There O
were O
also O
some O
. O

There O
have O
been O
too O
, O
I O
've O
heard O
of O
them O
too O
-- O
I O
've O
heard O
of O
them O
too O
-- O
I O
've O
heard O
of O
them O
too O
. O

You O
know O
, O
recently O
, O
this O
, O
an O
old O
professor O
called O
Professor O
Liu B-PERSON
Xiwei I-PERSON
published O
some O
views O
in O
Southern B-ORG
Weekend I-ORG
, O
that O
have O
stirred O
up O
a O
huge O
controversy O
. O

Yeah O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

You O
just O
said O
, O
ah O
, O
secondly B-ORDINAL
, O
we O
need O
to O
look O
at O
the O
new O
products O
, O
and O
thirdly B-ORDINAL
, O
look O
at O
the O
new O
technology O
. O

Uh O
, O
yes O
, O
I O
have O
also O
heard O
of O
such O
a O
professional O
voice O
, O
that O
there O
is O
not O
a O
lot O
of O
new O
technology O
in O
the O
Beijing B-GPE
car O
show O
this O
time O
. O

I O
believe O
this O
can O
be O
seen O
dialectically O
. O

Yes O
. O

Ah O
, O
eh O
, O
for O
any O
company O
to O
participate O
in O
an O
exhibition O
, O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
its O
chief O
purpose O
in O
participating O
in O
this O
exhibition O
is O
to O
enter O
this O
market O
. O

Within O
a O
period O
of O
time O
in O
the O
future O
, O
as O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
market O
, O
ah O
, O
with O
its O
spending O
trends O
, O
the O
direction O
of O
government O
policies O
, O
and O
the O
actual O
strength O
of O
national O
economic O
income O
, O
will O
all O
decide O
for O
the O
enterprise O
what O
type O
of O
technology O
and O
products O
they O
will O
showcase O
during O
this O
car O
exhibition O
. O

So O
if O
we O
were O
to O
rate O
the B-EVENT
Beijing I-EVENT
Auto I-EVENT
Show I-EVENT
with O
other O
A O
- O
level O
exhibitions O
in O
the O
world O
, O
there O
was O
indeed O
a O
technological O
difference O
. O

This O
is O
an O
objective O
fact O
. O

But O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
looking O
at O
the O
future O
of O
China B-GPE
's O
consumer O
market O
, O
I O
think O
the O
new O
technology O
brought O
to O
this O
car O
show O
is O
sufficient O
for O
us O
Chinese B-NORP
who O
are O
in O
the O
auto O
industry O
to O
learn O
, O
eh O
, O
to O
catch O
up O
and O
to O
surpass O
. O

How O
are O
Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE
's I-GPE
relations O
with O
the O
mainland O
. O

To O
describe O
it O
in O
one O
sentence O
, O
in O
the O
past O
the O
economic O
relationship O
consisted O
of O
everybody O
making O
money O
in O
Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE
and O
then O
spending O
it O
in O
the O
mainland O
. O

But O
as O
the O
renminbi O
increases O
in O
value O
, O
many O
people O
today O
are O
speculating O
that O
in O
the O
future O
they O
might O
work O
hard O
in O
the O
mainland O
and O
then O
come O
to O
Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE
to O
enjoy O
life O
. O

Is O
such O
a O
trend O
possible O
, O
Professor O
Ha B-PERSON
. O

Ah O
, O
I O
think O
, O
um O
, O
that O
when O
one O
works O
in O
the O
mainland O
and O
then O
comes O
to O
Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE
to O
spend O
money O
, O
um O
, O
there O
is O
a O
big O
difference O
in O
the O
wages O
between O
the O
two O
regions O
and O
maybe O
, O
um O
, O
the O
burden O
will O
be O
quite O
heavy O
, O
ah O
. O

Uh-huh O
, O
but O
what O
everybody O
is O
most O
concerned O
about O
is O
how O
feasible O
it O
is O
to O
link O
the O
Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE
dollar O
, O
ah O
, O
to O
the O
renminbi O
. O

many O
Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE
academics O
these O
days O
have O
come O
out O
with O
some O
calls O
for O
such O
a O
thing O
, O
oh O
. O

What O
's O
your O
opinion O
. O

I O
think O
that O
, O
um O
, O
the O
market O
might O
have O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
conjecture O
regarding O
, O
um O
, O
the O
Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE
dollar O
's O
, O
ah O
, O
future O
and O
even O
the O
direction O
, O
eh O
, O
that O
policy O
on O
it O
might O
take O
, O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
, O
er O
, O
expectations O
. O

Right O
. O

But O
, O
um O
, O
judging O
from O
the O
current O
situation O
, O
I O
personally O
think O
there O
is O
n't O
the O
basic O
support O
for O
linking O
the O
Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE
dollar O
and O
the O
renminbi O
. O

Nor O
at O
the O
policy O
level O
is O
such O
a O
thing O
being O
considered O
. O

Looking O
at O
the O
fundamentals O
, O
can O
we O
see O
why O
the O
renminbi O
is O
appreciating O
. O

It O
's O
because O
um O
, O
China B-GPE
's O
current O
account O
surplus O
is O
quite O
large O
, O
ah O
, O
processing O
trade O
and O
the O
transit O
trade O
-- O
both O
are O
processing O
trade O
-- O
and O
this O
, O
regular O
trade O
all O
have O
, O
this O
, O
surplus O
. O

Um O
, O
also O
, O
the O
growth O
in O
foreign O
exchange O
reserves O
has O
been O
quite O
rapid O
because O
the O
flow O
of O
money O
is O
n't O
outward O
. O

Um O
, O
I O
think O
that O
the O
police O
should O
all O
have O
their O
own O
district O
of O
jurisdiction O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

If O
he O
's O
going O
to O
leave O
your O
, O
this O
, O
district O
of O
jurisdiction O
, O
there O
might O
be O
some O
problems O
when O
making O
an O
arrest O
. O

It O
wo O
n't O
be O
as O
, O
this O
, O
convenient O
as O
in O
your O
own O
jurisdiction O
. O

Ah O
, O
it O
'll O
be O
troublesome O
. O

Yes O
, O
yes O
, O
yes O
. O

What O
do O
you O
do O
when O
you O
encounter O
such O
a O
situation O
. O

I O
would O
have O
the O
security O
guards O
follow O
him O
and O
conceal O
myself O
well O
. O

I O
myself O
, O
eh O
, O
am O
a O
plain O
- O
clothes O
policeman O
, O
so O
I O
would O
carry O
my O
work O
ID O
and O
wait O
somewhere O
he O
would O
show O
up O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Do O
n't O
move O
. O

I O
took O
out O
my O
work O
ID O
from O
my O
pocket O
, O
see O
, O
I O
'm O
a O
policeman O
, O

I O
am O
the O
local O
regional O
police O
officer O
here O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
am O
the O
regional O
police O
officer O
for O
the O
something O
, O
something O
police O
post O
controlled O
in O
the O
West O
End O
. O

What O
are O
you O
doing O
here O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
doing O
anything O
. O

That O
's O
not O
right O
. O

One O
look O
at O
you O
tells O
me O
you O
're O
up O
to O
no O
good O
. O

Uh O
, O
I O
've O
been O
watching O
you O
. O

You O
've O
been O
eyeing O
that O
lady O
's O
pocket O
, O
that O
satchel O
. O

Are O
you O
planning O
to O
steal O
it O
. O

Are O
you O
carrying O
a O
knife O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
carrying O
a O
knife O
. O

not O
good O
enough O
. O

I O
have O
to O
search O
you O
. O

So O
I O
quickly O
searched O
him O
. O

There O
is O
a O
technique O
to O
this O
. O

Doing O
the O
search O
I O
verified O
that O
he O
was O
carrying O
a O
tool O
used O
for O
criminal O
acts O
. O

At O
this O
point O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
stop O
. O

My O
eyebrows O
did O
n't O
move O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
have O
any O
feeling O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

ah O
, O
I O
quickly O
patted O
him O
down O
. O

I O
do O
this O
everyday O
. O

It O
was O
an O
awl O
, O
then O
I O
continued O
working O
downward O
. O

I O
worked O
downward O
, O
working O
toward O
the O
shoes O
, O
moving O
toward O
the O
pant O
legs O
, O
lifting O
the O
pant O
legs O
, O
and O
then O
taking O
off O
the O
shoes O
and O
pulling O
out O
the O
cushions O
inside O
the O
shoes O
. O

Uh-huh O
, O
nothing O
. O

There O
was O
really O
nothing O
. O

Uh-huh O
, O
well O
, O
I O
see O
that O
you O
do O
n't O
look O
like O
a O
good O
person O
still O
, O
right O
. O

You O
see O
that O
. O

It O
's O
Haidian B-GPE
, O
Uh O
. O

This O
is O
my O
stomping O
ground O
, O
ah O
. O

So O
go O
to O
there O
. O

When O
you O
're O
there O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
care O
what O
you O
want O
to O
do O
. O

Uh O
, O
go O
, O
go O
. O

Ha O
, O
so O
in O
this O
way O
he O
was O
eh O
, O
coaxed O
back O
. O

Yes O
, O
he O
was O
coaxed O
back O
. O

After O
he O
was O
coaxed O
back O
, O
he O
again O
took O
his O
original O
path O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Then O
when O
he O
was O
caught O
, O
his O
entire O
process O
was O
filmed O
with O
a O
DV O
machine O
. O

And O
is O
he O
still O
on O
your O
turf O
. O

This O
version O
of O
events O
given O
on O
the O
spot O
will O
make O
ordinary O
people O
feel O
extremely O
happy O
. O

Um O
, O
well O
, O
we O
also O
want O
to O
know O
, O
uh O
, O
in O
Britain B-GPE
, O
including O
its O
media O
and O
also O
the O
people O
, O
what O
kind O
of O
attitude O
they O
really O
have O
toward O
this O
incident O
. O

Has O
the O
incident O
raised O
any O
worries O
locally O
regarding O
security O
. O

Um O
, O
it O
's O
fair O
to O
say O
that O
the O
British B-NORP
media O
is O
giving O
a O
lot O
of O
attention O
to O
the O
matter O
. O

Recently O
, O
the O
large O
newspapers O
, O
the O
Times B-ORG
, O
Britain B-GPE
's O
, O
uh O
, O
BBC B-ORG
, O
uh O
, O
this O
, O
the O
major O
media O
, O
we O
should O
say O
, O
uh O
, O
uh O
, O
have O
all O
devoted O
a O
lot O
of O
space O
to O
this O
matter O
. O

Um O
, O
the O
reaction O
of O
Britain B-GPE
's O
political O
community O
toward O
the O
incident O
, O
eh O
, O
can O
also O
be O
said O
to O
be O
very O
, O
um O
, O
er O
, O
er O
, O
sharp O
. O

So O
, O
uh O
, O
one O
is O
that O
at O
the O
time O
, O
um O
, O
Britain B-GPE
very O
quickly O
summoned O
, O
um O
, O
the O
Russian B-NORP
, O
um O
, O
ambassador O
to O
Great B-GPE
Britain I-GPE
, O
uh O
, O
to O
ask O
that O
they O
promptly O
provide O
related O
information O
and O
, O
um O
, O
cooperation O
in O
the O
investigation O
over O
this O
affair O
. O

Secondly O
, O
eh O
, O
um O
, O
the O
British B-NORP
Home O
Secretary O
Reid B-PERSON
, O
eh O
, O
he O
has O
especially O
formed O
an O
investigation O
team O
, O
and O
, O
wants O
to O
assess O
together O
with O
experts O
the O
incident O
's O
, O
um O
, O
um O
, O
possible O
effects O
on O
the O
British B-NORP
public O
. O

So O
today O
, O
the O
30th B-ORDINAL
, O
well O
, O
the O
home O
secretary O
, O
eh O
, O
also O
need O
to O
explain O
this O
matter O
to O
the O
British B-NORP
parliament O
, O
eh O
, O
to O
the O
MPs O
, O
and O
undergo O
, O
um O
, O
questioning O
by O
the O
MPs O
. O
