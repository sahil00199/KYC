the O

in O
the B-DATE
second I-DATE
half I-DATE

mainly O
due O

In O
the B-DATE

the O

higher O

that O

Among O
import O
sectors O

swift O
growth O
comes O
mainly O
from O
imports O

, O
39.9 B-PERCENT

Secondly B-ORDINAL
, O
the O
overly O
high O
valuation O
of O
the O

is O
also O
an O
indispensable O
factor O
. O

An O
overly O
high O
peso O
exchange O
rate O
stimulated O
imports O
, O
but O
hindered O

It O
is O
commonly O
known O
that O
in O
1994 B-DATE
, O
before O
the O
outbreak O
of O
the O
financial O
crisis O
, O
the O
trade O
deficit O
was O
once O
as O

as O
more B-MONEY

18 I-MONEY

The O
huge O
trade O
deficit O
was O
one O
of O
the O
internal O
reasons O
that O
triggered O
this O
crisis O
. O

Hence O
, O
the O
trade O
situation O
last B-DATE

has O
caused O
extreme O
concern O
among O
people O
from O
economic O
circles O
, O
who O
even O
predicted O
that O
in O
1998 B-DATE
, O
foreign O
trade O
deficit O
would O
revive O
. O

They O
pointed O
out O
that O
, O
this B-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
except O
for O
an O
overly O
high O
peso O
exchange O
rate O
, O
exports O
would O
also O
face O
some O
new O
unfavorable O
factors O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
Asian B-NORP
currency O
devaluation O
will O
decrease O
export O
competitiveness O
, O
and O
the O
fall O
of O
oil O
price O
will O
significantly O
reduce O

. O

Under O
these O
circumstances O
, O
if O
the O
import O

momentum O
can O
not O
be O
restrained O
, O
this O
year O
, O
a O
