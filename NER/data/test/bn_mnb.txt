Gregg B-PERSON
Jarrett I-PERSON
, O
they O
did O
get O
a O
unanimous O
court O
for O
this O
decision O
. O

Absolutely O
, O
Brian B-PERSON
. O

It O
was O
very O
stern O
, O
very O
direct O
and O
it O
left O
no O
question O
, O
I O
think O
, O
in O
the O
minds O
of O
anybody O
that O
this O
court O
unanimously O
believes O
that O
certification O
should O
include O
the O
manual O
recount O
, O
and O
that O
is O
a O
clear O
victory O
for O
Vice O
President O
Al B-PERSON
Gore I-PERSON
. O

The O
language O
here O
, O
really O
leaves O
no O
doubt O
. O

The O
right O
of O
the O
people O
to O
cast O
their O
vote O
, O
the O
court O
said O
, O
is O
paramount O
. O

The O
amended O
certifications O
must O
be O
accepted O
by O
November B-DATE
26 I-DATE
. O

The O
reason O
they O
are O
picking O
that O
particular O
day O
is O
it O
allows O
, O
Brian B-PERSON
, O
enough O
time O
for O
the O
aggrieved O
party O
, O
the O
losing O
party O
to O
file O
within O
10 B-DATE
days I-DATE
a O
contest O
of O
the O
certification O
and O
that O
still O
allows O
enough O
time O
for O
the O
contest O
to O
be O
litigated O
through O
the O
courts O
primarily O
the O
circuit O
court O
and O
back O
to O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
if O
necessary O
and O
still O
meet O
the O
December B-DATE
12 I-DATE
deadline O
for O
the O
Electoral B-ORG
College I-ORG
vote O
here O
. O

Now O
, O
Greg B-PERSON
, O
the O
only O
question O
that O
means O
anything O
at O
this O
hour O
. O

We O
know O
their O
view O
is O
the O
hand O
counts O
should O
now O
be O
included O
. O

Will O
it O
put O
Al B-PERSON
Gore I-PERSON
over O
the O
top O
in O
the O
race O
to O
match O
and O
exceed O
the O
votes O
of O
George B-PERSON
W. I-PERSON
Bush I-PERSON
? O

It O
very O
well O
could O
, O
although O
, O
I O
must O
say O
that O
the O
Gore B-PERSON
campaign O
has O
been O
somewhat O
disappointed O
by O
the O
number O
of O
votes O
they O
have O
not O
received O
thus O
far O
in O
the O
counties O
that O
are O
undertaking O
the O
manual O
recounts O
, O
Brian B-PERSON
, O
but O
a O
lot O
of O
hand O
counts O
still O
must O
be O
tallied O
. O

We O
are O
also O
including O
the O
undervotes O
of O
10,000 B-CARDINAL
in O
Palm B-GPE
Beach I-GPE
and O
junt O
votes O
of O
10,000 B-CARDINAL
in O
Miami B-GPE
- I-GPE
Dade I-GPE
as O
well O
. O

Keep O
in O
mind O
, O
those O
were O
not O
registered O
by O
the O
computers O
because O
they O
either O
had O
a O
hanging O
chad O
or O
dimpled O
chad O
. O

Those O
must O
be O
gone O
over O
by O
hand O
by O
each O
respective O
canvassing O
board O
. O

So O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
votes O
remaining O
there O
. O

This O
is O
a O
Gore B-PERSON
campaign O
to O
the B-FAC
White I-FAC
House I-FAC
. O

Greg B-PERSON
, O
just O
a O
logistic O
question O
, O
How O
long O
is O
it O
going O
take O
you O
to O
get O
the O
opinion O
run O
to O
you O
from O
the O
building O
behind O
you O
? O

I O
would O
say O
we O
should O
have O
it O
here O
in O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
five I-DATE
minutes I-DATE
. O

It O
depends O
how O
quickly O
the O
line O
moves O
. O

We O
have O
two B-CARDINAL
producers O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
near O
the O
front O
of O
the O
line O
. O

It O
how O
quickly O
they O
get O
handed O
. O

It O
reversed O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
orders O
of O
the O
earlier O
trial O
court O
, O
Circuit B-ORG
Court I-ORG
Judge O
Terry B-PERSON
Lewis I-PERSON
. O

The O
bottom O
line O
, O
this O
court O
rules O
unanimously O
the O
right O
of O
the O
people O
to O
have O
the O
votes O
counted O
is O
paramount O
, O
thus O
, O
the O
amended O
certifications O
to O
include O
the O
hand O
counts O
must O
be O
accepted O
by O
November B-DATE
26 I-DATE
. O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
seemed O
to O
have O
some O
language O
here O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
Brian B-PERSON
I O
do O
have O
it O
handed O
to O
me O
now O
. O

Let O
me O
take O
a O
the O
. O

Brian B-PERSON
, O
if O
for O
some O
reason O
the O
Secretary O
of O
State B-ORG
would O
n't O
accept O
by O
the B-DATE
26th I-DATE
, O
the O
certification O
, O
it O
could O
be O
certified O
elsewhere O
. O

Gregg O
Jarrett O
. O

I O
should O
point O
out O
, O
he O
is O
a O
former O
lawyer O
himself O
and O
so O
can O
help O
put O
this O
into O
English B-LANGUAGE
. O

Greg B-PERSON
, O
go O
ahead O
, O
if O
you O
come O
to O
a O
passage O
we O
should O
hear O
. O

I O
'm O
flipping O
through O
the O
summary O
of O
enacts O
because O
that O
is O
not O
important O
. O

The O
summary O
of O
facts O

You O
flag O
us O
when O
you O
come O
to O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
portion O
we O
should O
hear O
aloud O
