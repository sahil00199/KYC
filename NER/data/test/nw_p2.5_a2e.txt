He O

the O

. O

He O
added O
that O
his O
country O

position O
was O
based O
" O
on O
the O
following O
: O

firstly O
, O
Syria B-GPE
is O
100 B-PERCENT

innocent O
of O
the O
crime O

there O

no O

Secondly O
, O
if O
there O
was O
any O
Syrian B-NORP
citizen O
that O
might O
have O
been O

this O

then O
he O

the O

our O

we O

in O
the B-GPE

the O
