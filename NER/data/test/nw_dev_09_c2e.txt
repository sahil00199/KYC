The O
incident O
happened O
in O
March O
once O
made O
this O
small O
county O
town O
located O
in O
eastern O
Qinghai O
- O
Tibet O
Plateau O
restless O
. O

However O
, O
before O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
" O
May O
Day O
" O
, O
this O
place O
had O
resumed O
its O
past O
peace O
. O

This O
small O
town O
, O
which O
is O
well O
- O
known O
for O
the O
Labuleng O
Lamasery O
, O
also O
gives O
out O
unique O
and O
mystical O
charm O
once O
again O
. O

The O
famous O
scenic O
spot O
Labuleng O
Lamasery O
has O
also O
ushered O
in O
an O
increasing O
number O
of O
tourists O
during O
the O
festival O
. O

The O
guide O
lama O
led O
the O
tourists O
from O
across O
the O
country O
who O
came O
here O
out O
of O
admiration O
to O
visit O
every O
structure O
here O
one O
by O
one O
starting O
from O
the O
ticket O
sales O
office O
and O
to O
feel O
the O
beauty O
and O
magic O
of O
Tibetan O
Buddhism O
. O

" O
I O
talked O
to O
my O
friend O
in O
Gannan O
over O
the O
phone O
before O
I O
came O
. O

It O
is O
very O
safe O
to O
travel O
here O
. O

There O
is O
no O
need O
to O
worry O
. O
" O

A O
middle O
- O
aged O
tourist O
from O
Lanzhou O
Electric O
Corporation O
kept O
videotaping O
while O
asking O
the O
guide O
various O
questions O
in O
religion O
and O
history O
endlessly O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

At O
the O
side O
of O
the O
arena O
for O
scriptural O
dialect O
in O
front O
of O
the O
Great O
Temple O
of O
the O
Golden O
Tile O
, O
two O
young O
female O
tourists O
from O
Zhejiang O
Province O
were O
exchanging O
cameras O
with O
each O
other O
to O
take O
a O
picture O
with O
a O
lama O
as O
souvenir O
. O

Two O
Tibetan O
women O
at O
the O
side O
who O
came O
to O
worship O
Buddha O
smiled O
back O
in O
return O
of O
their O
greetings O
. O

Despite O
undergoing O
a O
journey O
of O
30 O
hours O
by O
train O
and O
four O
hours O
by O
car O
, O
they O
still O
felt O
that O
it O
was O
worthwhile O
:. O

" O
It O
is O
because O
the O
scenery O
here O
is O
still O
holy O
and O
beautiful O
. O

While O
mobile O
phones O
have O
brought O
tremendous O
convenience O
in O
information O
exchanges O
to O
people O
, O
they O
have O
also O
brought O
about O
endless O
troubles O
to O
people O
. O

First O
, O
the O
endless O
junk O
text O
messages O
, O
and O
then O
the O
torture O
of O
the O
" O
one O
- O
ring O
calls O
" O
at O
all O
hours O
of O
the O
day O
and O
night O
. O

The O
most O
annoying O
is O
that O
up O
until O
now O
, O
besides O
the O
positions O
made O
known O
by O
relevant O
government O
departments O
, O
there O
is O
still O
no O
concrete O
action O
to O
resolve O
the O
problem O
. O

It O
seems O
that O
since O
consumers O
have O
chosen O
to O
use O
mobile O
phones O
, O
they O
should O
endure O
this O
unexpected O
torture O
. O

The O
continuous O
concern O
by O
the O
media O
has O
helped O
people O
to O
heighten O
their O
awareness O
against O
" O
one O
- O
ring O
calls O
" O
. O

It O
is O
no O
longer O
easy O
to O
use O
" O
one O
- O
ring O
calls O
" O
to O
defraud O
mobile O
phone O
user O
fees O
. O

However O
, O
it O
does O
not O
mean O
that O
people O
can O
tolerate O
the O
existence O
of O
" O
one O
- O
ring O
calls O
" O
and O
that O
they O
can O
give O
up O
the O
close O
questioning O
of O
the O
responsibilities O
of O
relevant O
government O
departments O
and O
telecommunication O
operators O
. O

The O
first O
response O
of O
many O
mobile O
phone O
users O
when O
they O
hear O
the O
" O
one O
- O
ring O
call O
" O
is O
: O
" O
Why O
does O
n't O
anyone O
attend O
to O
this O
? O
" O

A O
survey O
conducted O
by O
websites O
including O
Sina O
and O
Tencent O
with O
close O
to O
200,000 O
netizens O
showed O
that O
over O
70 O
percent O
of O
people O
frequently O
encounter O
" O
one O
- O
ring O
calls O
" O
and O
68.5 O
percent O
of O
people O
believed O
that O
telecommunication O
operators O
take O
part O
in O
the O
profit O
- O
sharing O
of O
" O
one O
- O
ring O
calls O
" O
. O

After O
five O
years O
of O
negotiation O
process O
, O
the O
" O
Conventions O
on O
the O

It O
came O
into O

. O

Jamaica O

the O
first O
country O
to O

of O
this O
year O
, O

The O

so O
that O
they O
can O
have O
equal O
opportunity O
to O
make O
valuable O
contributions O
to O
society O
. O

Since O
realistic O
toy O
weapons O
could O
be O
mixed O
up O
with O
real O
ones O
, O
confuse O
the O
police O
's O
attention O
, O
and O
threaten O
social O

15 O
