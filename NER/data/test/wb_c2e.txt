-- O
Some O
Thoughts O
on O
the O
Attitude O
of O
Benign O
Inheritance O
towards O
Social O
Reform O
. O

A O
glance O
at O
the O
title O
, O
people O
with O
a O
little O
political O
sensitivity O
may O
roughly O
understand O
the O
core O
topic O
of O
this O
article O
: O
the O
rule O
of O
benign O
interaction O
between O
planned O
economy O
and O
market O
economy O
, O
and O
between O
public O
ownership O
and O
private O
ownership O
-- O
because O
only O
their O
relationships O
are O
those O
between O
a O
father O
and O
a O
son O
, O
and O
it O
is O
only O
between O
them O
are O
there O
different O
conflicts O
involving O
" O
human O
relations O
, O
" O
" O
rules O
" O
and O
" O
science O
, O
" O
as O
well O
as O
bloody O
wrestling O
between O
classes O
, O
factions O
and O
individuals O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
morality O
and O
interests O
. O

Comparing O
planned O
economy O
and O
public O
ownership O
to O
a O
father O
is O
tantamount O
to O
comparing O
market O
economy O
and O
private O
ownership O
to O
a O
son O
, O
which O
holds O
water O
principally O
and O
historically O
no O
matter O
you O
put O
it O
this O
way O
or O
another O
. O

This O
is O
because O
the O
former O
two B-CARDINAL
given O
" O
fatherhood O
" O
are O
indeed O
the O
most O
essential O
factors O
of O
the O
national O
character O
and O
institution O
of O
the O
socialist B-NORP
new O
China B-GPE
, O
while O
the O
latter O
two O
dubbed O
" O
son O
" O
in O
this O
article O
-- O
are O
indeed O
the O
ideological O
outcomes O
derived O
after O
the O
death O
of O
China B-GPE
's O
founder O
Comrade O
Mao B-PERSON
Zedong I-PERSON
under O
tremendous O
international O
and O
domestic O
political O
pressures O
on O
planned O
economy O
and O
public O
ownership O
, O
which O
grew O
into O
today B-DATE
's O
para-system O
after O
about O
30 B-DATE
years I-DATE
of O
reform O
and O
opening O
up O
. O

Regarding O
this O
, O
the O
factual O
development O
process O
of O
political O
civilization O
that O
the O
Marxist B-NORP
ideology O
has O
been O
increasingly O
marginalized O
over O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
30 I-DATE
years I-DATE
or O
so O
is O
a O
strong O
evidence O
. O

By O
sorting O
out O
the O
essence O
of O
the O
above O
historical O
background O
and O
conceptual O
relationships O
, O
we O
will O
have O
a O
pretty O
thorough O
, O
comprehensive O
and O
systematic O
knowledge O
framework O
about O
the O
benign O
inevitable O
trends O
and O
development O
guidelines O
of O
the O
future O
society O
dependent O
on O
the O
rule O
of O
society O
, O
so O
that O
the O
associated O
impression O
captured O
may O
be O
more O
concrete O
. O

Regarding O
this O
, O
my O
standpoint O
is O
: O
because O
the O
socialism O
underpinned O
by O
planned O
economy O
, O
public O
ownership O
and O
the O
people O
's O
democratic O
dictatorship O
is O
indeed O
a O
really O
" O
fresh O
" O
systemic O
thing O
for O
China B-GPE
in O
the B-DATE
mid I-DATE
and I-DATE
late I-DATE
20th I-DATE
century I-DATE
-- O
without O
a O
model O
or O
sufficient O
experience O
or O
theories O
to O
refer O
to O
, O
no O
matter O
how O
scientific O
its O
kernel O
is O
, O
it O
is O
hard O
not O
to O
have O
certain O
superficial O
and O
local O
problems O
. O

However O
, O
this O
should O
not O
provide O
an O
excuse O
to O
overthrow O
it O
by O
fair O
means O
or O
foul O
, O
as O
he O
is O
our O
father O
and O
the O
common O
choice O
of O
millions B-CARDINAL
of O
laboring O
people O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
it O
" O
finally O
became O
our O
national O
character O
and O
main O
system O
after O
over O
half B-DATE
a I-DATE
century I-DATE
of O
international O
and O
domestic O
political O
transformation O
" O
is O
a O
stronger O
proof O
that O
it O
is O
the O
milestone O
for O
a O
new O
civilization O
resulted O
from O
the O
blood O
and O
sweat O
of O
thousands B-CARDINAL
of O
proletarian O
revolutionary O
martyrs O
. O

Therefore O
, O
no O
matter O
from O
the O
perspective O
of O
average O
citizens O
or O
from O
the O
standpoint O
of O
the O
founder O
of O
the O
new O
government O
, O
we O
should O
respect O
and O
develop O
her O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
inheritance O
, O
innovation O
and O
improvement O
. O

Is O
my O
opinion O
above O
correct O
? O

I O
believe O
you O
will O
naturally O
obtain O
a O
relatively O
fair O
and O
just O
conclusion O
if O
you O
could O
understand O
and O
treat O
the O
above O
- O
mentioned O
" O
father O
" O
system O
and O
" O
son O
" O
system O
with O
impartiality O
and O
sufficient O
goodwill O
. O

For O
example O
, O
based O
on O
the O
existing O
institutional O
cultural O
heritage O
in O
the O
human O
history O
, O
we O
could O
see O
: O
the O
" O
father O
" O
system O
mentioned O
herein O
has O
the O
majority O
in O
mind O
or O
it O
is O
established O
in O
the O
fundamental O
and O
long O
- O
term O
interests O
of O
the O
majority O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
need O
for O
sustainable O
and O
sound O
development O
of O
the O
country O
, O
the O
nation O
, O
and O
the O
overall O
society O
-- O
while O
the O
" O
son O
" O
system O
mentioned O
herein O
is O
ignorant O
and O
sick O
in O
the O
company O
of O
such O
behavioral O
characteristics O
as O
exploitation O
, O
fraudulence O
, O
pernicious O
influence O
and O
robbery O
. O

So O
, O
we O
can O
not O
urge O
the O
son O
to O
throttle O
the O
essentially O
healthy O
and O
scientific O
" O
father O
" O
system O
by O
fair O
mean O
or O
foul O
without O
considering O
the O
consequences O
, O
because O
there O
are O
problems O
in O
its O
practice O
and O
development O
-- O
such O
as O
state O
monopoly O
for O
purchases O
and O
sales O
, O
lower O
efficiency O
due O
to O
centralized O
management O
, O
and O
inhibition O
of O
the O
will O
of O
productivity O
by O
undue O
political O
pressure O
resulting O
from O
class O
struggles O
during O
the O
new O
deal O
. O

It O
is O
because O
that O
will O
not O
only O
make O
the O
society O
increasingly O
ignorant O
and O
sick O
as O
it O
violates O
the O
rule O
of O
benign O
social O
development O
, O
distorts O
normal O
" O
human O
relations O
" O
and O
the O
ethic O
and O
prevalent O
value O
and O
the O
rule O
of O
civilization O
update O
rooted O
in O
it O
, O
but O
the O
humanity O
will O
retrogress O
as O
people O
's O
thoughts O
and O
behaviors O
become O
increasingly O
ridiculous O
. O

Yes O
, O
this O
is O
the O
case O
. O

My O
opinion O
above O
is O
not O
absurd O
and O
delusive O
at O
all O
, O
because O
this O
is O
true O
not O
only O
in O
theory O
, O
but O
also O
to O
the O
rule O
of O
social O
development O
as O
demonstrated O
by O
historical O
facts O
, O
as O
well O
as O
from O
the O
perspective O
of O
the O
situation O
and O
reality O
of O
the O
country O
: O

against O
planned O

, O
public O
ownership O
and O
dictatorship O
of O
the O
proletariat O
. O
" O

All O
their O
criticisms O
are O
directed O
at O
the O
developmental O
symptoms O
such O
as O
" O
lower O
efficiency O
due O
to O

" O
or O

for O

how O
empty O
, O

and O

it O

That O
's O
why O
I O
want O
to O
say O
to O
the O
world O
and O
the O
age O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O
article O
: O
when O
the O
father O
's O

are O
injured O
, O
we O
should O
try O
our O
best O
to O
treat O
the O
foot O
problem O
, O
and O
open O
up O
a O
new O
life O
and O
embrace O

in O
the O
principle O
of O
respecting O
human O
relations O
, O
obeying O
people O
's O
wishes O
, O
conforming O
to O
science O
and O
carrying O
on O
the O
legacy O
-- O
if O
the O
present O
capitalist O
followers O
frantically O
urge O
the O
son O
to O
kill O
him O
by O
all O
means O
, O
the O
result O
could O
only O
be O
a O
tragedy O
! O

And O
these O
happen O
to O
be O
the O
core O
of O
the O
destiny O
where O
the O
capitalist O
roaders O
" O
will O
inevitably O
bury O
themselves O
due O
to O
their O
ignorance O
and O
insanity O
, O
and O
more O
or O
less O
harm O
the O
human O
society O
! O
" O

At O
last O
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
admonish O
sincerely O
and O
earnestly O
those O
who O
blindly O
oppose O
, O
hate O
and O
even O
suppress O
planned O
economy O
, O
public O
ownership O
and O
dictatorship O
of O
the O
proletariat O
, O
especially O
the O
" O
mainstream O
elite O

including O
Wu B-PERSON
Jinglian I-PERSON
, O
who O
insist O
on O
smearing O
the O
" O

" O
to O
the O
end O
: O
do O
not O
treat O
the O
" O

the O
new O
civilization O
is O
based O
barbarously O
, O
against O
your O
conscience O
and O
frantically O
for O
immediate O
gains O
. O

The O
result O
is O
definitely O
a O
tragedy O
-- O
because O
even O
if O
you O
kill O
the O
" O
father O
, O
" O
your O
felony O
will O
be O
disdained O
by O

Note O
, O
this O

The O

2 B-MONEY

In O

the O

between O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
places O
is O
larger O
than O
2 B-MONEY

because O
China B-GPE

so O
many O

as O
in O
the O
US B-GPE
; O
for O
example O
, O
the O
highway O
maintenance O

in O
China B-GPE
is O
paid O
separately O
. O

Just O
now O
, O
I O
only O
narrated O
a O
fact O
. O

But O
I O
believe O
that O
different O
persons O
see O
different O
problems O
in O
this O
fact O
. O

Let O
me O
describe O
people O
's O
two B-CARDINAL
reactions O
that O
I O
can O
imagine O
, O
or O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
problems O
I O
can O
see O
. O

1. B-CARDINAL
The O
US B-GPE
gas O
price O
is O
too O
cheap O
. O

In O
an O
absolute O
sense O
, O
the O
US B-GPE
gas O
price O
has O
+already O
been O
cheaper O
than O
China B-GPE
's O
, O
and O
in O
a O
relative O
sense O
, O
the O
US B-GPE
gas O
price O
is O
even O
cheaper O
. O

In O
the O
US B-GPE
, O
the O
money O
you O
pay O
for O
a O
meal O
at O
McDonald B-ORG
's O
can O
fill O
up O
more O
than O
10 B-QUANTITY
liters I-QUANTITY
of O
gas O
, O
but O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
you O
can O
get O
5 B-QUANTITY
- I-QUANTITY
6 I-QUANTITY
liters I-QUANTITY
of O
gas O
at O
most O
. O

The O
US B-GPE
low O
gas O
price O
policy O
has O
undoubtedly O
led O
to O
this O
country O
's O
excessive O
use O
of O
and O
overdependence O
on O
energy O
resources O
. O

However O
, O
there O
is O
more O
to O
this O
matter O
, O
the O
whole O
world O
has O
to O
share O
the O
various O
negative O
effects O
caused O
by O
the O
US B-GPE
excessive O
energy O
consumption O
: O
global O
warming O
, O
and O
wars O
caused O
by O
oil O
, O
etc. O

It O
is O
totally O
a O
joke O
that O
the O
US B-GPE
gas O
price O
could O
be O
cheaper O
than O
China B-GPE
's O
. O

2. B-CARDINAL
China B-GPE
's O
gas O
price O
is O
too O
expensive O
. O

Both O
Americans B-NORP
and O
Chinese B-NORP
buy O
gas O
from O
the O
international O
market O
, O
and O
the O
technology O
and O
cost O
of O
oil O
refinement O
are O
not O
too O
much O
different O
. O

But O
with O
the O
US B-GPE
gas O
price O
including O
taxes O
even O
lower O
than O
China B-GPE
's O
gas O
price O
excluding O
taxes O
, O
you O
can O
see O
how O
much O
money O
Chinese B-NORP
oil O
companies O
have O
made O
out O
of O
this O
. O

If O
there O
are O
no O
price O
controls O
and O
monopolies O
, O
China B-GPE
's O
gas O
price O
should O
n't O
have O
been O
this O
high O
. O

I O
want O
to O
say O
that O
I O
think O
these O
two B-CARDINAL
opinions O
are O
both O
correct O
. O

So O
, O
on O
the O
issue O
of O
oil O
consumption O
, O
I O
think O
China B-GPE
and O
the O
US B-GPE
, O
the O
No. O
1 B-CARDINAL
and O
No. O
2 B-CARDINAL
oil O
consumers O
in O
the O
world O
, O
are O
also O
a O
funny O
pair O
. O

From O
a O
global O
perspective O
, O
the O
US B-NORP
gas O
price O
is O
obviously O
too O
low O
. O

So O
Mankiw B-PERSON
at O
Harvard B-ORG
even O
formed O
a O
" O
Pigou O
Club O
, O
" O
gathering O
social O
celebrities O
who O
support O
levying O
higher O
taxes O
on O
gas O
prices O
-LRB- O
hereby O
raising O
gas O
prices O
-RRB- O
. O

China B-GPE
's O
gas O
prices O
are O
more O
complicated O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
gas O
prices O
in O
China B-GPE
are O
probably O
not O
very O
high O
, O
but O
in O
order O
to O
reduce O
China B-GPE
's O
future O
overdependence O
on O
gas O
, O
it O
may O
be O
better O
that O
China B-GPE
's O
gas O
prices O
are O
higher O
. O

But O
, O
the O
direct O
result O
of O
the O
gas O
price O
increase O
in O
China B-GPE
will O
be O
the O
increase O
of O
monopoly O
profits O
of O
the O
monopoly O
companies O
. O

This O
part O
of O
money O
will O
not O
become O
the O
government O
tax O
revenue O
, O
will O
not O
be O
used O
for O
public O
welfare O
, O
and O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
will O
only O
make O
the O
benefits O
of O
those O
people O
working O
at O
the O
monopoly O
department O
even O
better O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
the O
gas O
price O
in O
China B-GPE
is O
too O
high O
in O
the O
distributive O
sense O
. O

It O
is O
the O
price O
that O
transfers O
the O
entire O
social O
resources O
to O
a O
very O
small O
number O
of O
people O
. O

But O
in O
terms O
of O
sustainability O
, O
China B-GPE
's O
gas O
price O
may O
still O
be O
too O
low O
. O

We O
need O
high O
gas O
prices O
to O
control O
the O
overdependence O
on O
energy O
imports O
. O

Perhaps O
someone O
will O
condemn O
me O
, O
saying O
further O
increase O
of O
gas O
prices O
will O
make O
life O
unbearable O
for O
people O
. O

If O
you O
are O
a O
taxi O
driver O
, O
my O
reply O
is O
: O
the O
reason O
your O
life O
is O
unbearable O
is O
not O
the O
gas O
price O
, O
but O
because O
of O
our O
taxi O
licensing O
regulation O
system O
. O

If O
you O
are O
a O
car O
owner O
, O
my O
reply O
is O
: O
ride O
the O
subway O
and O
bus O
more O
often O
. O

It O
saves O
money O
, O
reduces O
congestion O
, O
and O
also O
lets O
you O
know O
car O
owners O
are O
not O
in O
a O
position O
to O
say O
" O
life O
is O
unbearable O
. O
" O

Compared O
with O
most O
people O
, O
your O
life O
is O
already O
quite O
good O

You O

[Bcc] O
If O

this O

[Bcc] O
But O
what O

How O

[Bcc] O
Even O

[Bcc] O
The O

[Bcc] O
Regardless O

[Bcc] O
Of O

[Bcc] O
These O

are O
far O
from O

to O
give O
him O
the O

[Bcc] O
What O

a O

, O
a O

[Bcc] O
Whether O

it O

a O

the O

[Bcc] O
If O

then O
God O

the O

[Bcc] O
if O

A B-DATE
month I-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
I O
was O
really O
desperate O
, O
I O
lost O
my O
current O
job O
, O
which O
I O
was O
completely O
unprepared O
for O
, O
and O
had O
to O
find O
a O
job O
within O
a B-DATE
month I-DATE
to O
keep O
myself O
going O
. O

Now O
in O
this B-DATE
month I-DATE
with O
the O
Christmas B-EVENT
holiday O
there O
's O
really O
only O
three B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
of O
actual O
work O
time O
, O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
any O
companies O
are O
going O
to O
be O
hiring O
people O
during O
this O
period O
. O

Despair O
, O
that O
sinking O
feeling O
weighing O
on O
my O
mind O
, O
so O
much O
pressure O
I O
could O
n't O
eat O
, O
could O
n't O
sleep O
; O
I O
was O
simply O
going O
crazy O
. O

But O
I O
still O
needed O
to O
do O
something O
; O
getting O
crazy O
- O
hysteric O
makes O
no O
sense O
. O

Then O
I O
started O
connecting O
with O
my O
friends O
in O
America B-GPE
; O
I O
went O
to O
Maimaiti B-PERSON
to O
ask O
for O
help O
, O
consulted O
about O
my O
status O
, O
and O
looked O
for O
a O
way O
to O
solve O
the O
problem O
. O

Even O
my O
relatives O
' O
friends O
in O
America B-GPE
and O
my O
parents O
' O
friends O
all O
got O
involved O
. O

Friends O
, O
it O
's O
always O
friends O
who O
help O
me O
at O
key O
moments O
. O

Many O
friends O
got O
people O
they O
knew O
to O
recommend O
me O
, O
help O
me O
send O
out O
resumes O
, O
or O
call O
and O
commiserate O
with O
me O
. O

There O
was O
one B-CARDINAL
friend O
who O
had O
just O
got O
an O
offer O
, O
but O
he O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
go O
, O
so O
he O
recommended O
me O
to O
go O
for O
him O
, O
but O
it O
was O
way O
off O
in O
LA B-GPE
, O
plus O
the O
salary O
was O
n't O
ideal O
, O
but O
at O
least O
it O
could O
help O
me O
keep O
the O
legal O
status O
, O
so O
I O
thought O
I O
would O
take O
it O
. O

After O
the O
telephone O
interview O
, O
I O
flew O
to O
LA B-GPE
, O
landing O
at O
12:00 B-TIME
noon I-TIME
, O
and O
at O
4:00 B-TIME
p.m. I-TIME
. O

I O
had O
the O
interview O
. O

By O
then O
17 B-TIME
- I-TIME
18 I-TIME
hours I-TIME
had O
passed O
since O
I O
'd O
gotten O
up O
at O
4:00 B-TIME
a.m. I-TIME

Although O
I O
was O
too O
tired O
to O
walk O
, O
I O
still O
had O
to O
pump O
up O
my O
spirits O
so O
I O
'd O
be O
in O
peak O
form O
for O
the O
interview O
. O

The O
interview O
did O
n't O
last O
long O
, O
just O
two B-TIME
hours I-TIME
and O
it O
was O
over O
. O

I O
felt O
the O
interview O
went O
well O
, O
and O
started O
to O
feel O
confident O
. O

But O
on O
that B-DATE
day I-DATE
one B-CARDINAL
senior O
level O
person O
was O
n't O
there O
, O
so O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
day I-DATE
early O
I O
had O
to O
go O
back O
to O
talk O
to O
him O
. O

So O
the O
next O
day O
I O
got O
up O
at O
7:00 B-TIME
and O
ran O
over O
to O
chat O
for O
an B-TIME
hour I-TIME
; O
that O
guy O
was O
nice O
, O
did O
n't O
embarrass O
me O
, O
so O
after O
an B-TIME
hour I-TIME
it O
ended O
happily O
. O

After O
that O
the O
boss O
took O
me O
to O
the O
home O
office O
, O
and O
on O
the O
way O
he O
gave O
me O
an O
oral O
offer O
, O
and O
he O
said O
it O
would O
not O
be O
easy O
for O
me O
to O
come O
right O
away O
, O
that O
I O
should O
do O
the O
physical O
exam O
immediately O
and O
do O
all O
the O
paperwork O
, O
wait O
until O
after O
New B-EVENT
Year I-EVENT
's I-EVENT
, O
and O
the O
HR O
director O
would O
return O
and O
turn O
in O
the O
H1 B-CARDINAL
. O

Then O
I O
went O
straight O
for O
the O
physical O
, O
and O
I O
filled O
out O
the O
application O
form O
, O
reference O
list O
, O
etc. O

At O
3:00 B-TIME
p.m. I-TIME
, O
the O
dust O
finally O
settled O
. O

Finally O
before O
Christmas B-EVENT
I O
received O
a O
Christmas B-EVENT
present O
. O

Although O
I O
still O
have O
n't O
made O
the O
final O
decision O
to O
go O
, O
at O
least O
I O
have O
a O
guaranteed O
- O
minimum O
choice O
. O

So O
I O
am O
thanking O
everyone O
for O
helping O
me O
. O

I O
hope O
that O
all O
my O
friends O
who O
are O
still O
looking O
for O
work O
will O
be O
able O
to O
find O
their O
ideal O
job O
in O

Breakneck O

m/h I-QUANTITY
on O
a O
Snowy O
Night O
. O

It O
also O
reminds O
me O
of O
something O
that O
I O
experienced O
several B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
also O
related O
to O
an O
airport O
and O
meeting O
people O
. O

A B-DATE
couple I-DATE
of I-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
my O
neighbor O
approached O
me O
to O
borrow O
my O
car O
, O
saying O
he O
was O
meeting O
his O
parents O
at O
the O
airport O
. O

He O
also O
said O
both O
his O
wife O
and O
children O
wanted O
to O
go O
. O

As O
his O
car O
was O
too O
small O
and O
mine O
was O
big O
, O
it O
could O
make O
his O
parents O
more O
comfortable O
. O

He O
added O
that O
he O
would O
only O
use O
it O
for O
one B-TIME
morning I-TIME
and O
would O
return O
it O
to O
me O
before O
noon B-TIME
. O

Although O
there O
was O
only O
a O
nodding O
acquaintance O
between O
the O
neighbor O
and O
me O
, O
we O
lived O
in O
the O
same O
apartment O
building O
after O
all O
and O
were O
both O
Chinese B-NORP
. O

So O
I O
discussed O
with O
my O
wife O
back O
home O
and O
lent O
him O
the O
car O
as O
we O
thought O
we O
would O
not O
be O
using O
the O
car O
until O
the B-TIME
same I-TIME
afternoon I-TIME
. O

And O
then O
something O
happened O
... O

At O
1:00pm B-TIME
, O
the O
neighbor O
called O
me O
, O
saying O
he O
took O
his O
parents O
to O
a O
buffet O
and O
would O
probably O
not O
to O
be O
back O
until O
around O
3:00pm B-TIME
. O

I O
of O
course O
agreed O
and O
asked O
them O
not O
to O
rush O
. O

This O
wait O
lasted O
till O
5:30pm B-TIME
, O
when O
the O
neighbor O
told O
me O
in O
a O
half B-CARDINAL
- O
crying O
tone O
that O
there O
was O
an O
accident O
, O
and O
everyone O
else O
was O
intact O
, O
except O
his O
father O
, O
who O
was O
in O
hospital O
for O
fractures O
. O

I O
comforted O
him O
first B-ORDINAL
and O
asked O
my O
friend O
to O
rush O
me O
to O
the O
hospital O
. O

My O
neighbor O
showed O
me O
the O
police O
report O
at O
the O
hospital O
, O
which O
indicated O
it O
was O
all O
my O
neighbor O
's O
fault O
. O

He O
clashed O
into O
a O
truck O
going O
straight O
when O
he O
made O
a O
left O
turn O
. O

My O
car O
was O
completely O
damaged O
and O
had O
been O
towed O
away O
. O

I O
forced O
myself O
to O
refrain O
from O
the O
grief O
of O
loosing O
my O
beloved O
car O
-LRB- O
mine O
was O
liability O
- O
only O
coverage O
-RRB- O
and O
asked O
the O
friend O
to O
send O
their O
family O
home O
. O

And O
then O
the O
nightmare O
began O
. O

The B-DATE
next I-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
my O
neighbor O
called O
me O
, O
saying O
his O
father O
needed O
to O
undergo O
an O
operation O
in O
hospital O
and O
asked O
where O
the O
money O
would O
come O
from O

I O
told O
him O
part O
would O
be O
covered O
by O
my O
car O
insurance O
. O

After O
a O
while O
, O
he O
called O
again O
, O
saying O
the O
operation O
charge O
was O
high O
and O
it O
was O
difficult O
for O
them O
to O
afford O

I O
tried O
my O
best O
to O
comfort O
him O
then O
and O
told O
him O
to O
think O
of O
a O
way O
slowly O

Just O
then O
, O
a O
nearly O
crazy O
voice O
of O
a O
woman O
came O
from O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
line O
, O
saying O
her O
family O
had O
just O
saved O
several B-MONEY
dozen I-MONEY
thousand I-MONEY
bucks I-MONEY
for O
the O
down O
payment O
of O
a O
house O
; O
where O
would O
they O
live O
afterwards O
if O
they O
spent O
this O
. O

She O
also O
said O
my O
car O
was O
a O
Japanese B-NORP
one O
, O
which O
had O
poor O
safety O
performance O
and O
it O
was O
my O
car O
to O
blame O
for O
the O
car O
accident O
. O

She O
added O
that O
I O
should O
pay O
the O
money O
because O
the O
car O
was O
mine O
. O

I O
hung O
up O
the O
phone O
angrily O
as O
the O
dialog O
could O
not O
go O
on O
. O

My O
wife O
-LSB- O
pw% O
-RSB- O
had O
been O
persuading O
me O
aside O
, O
saying O
some O
women O
would O
easily O
lose O
mind O
once O
in O
fury O
. O

She O
asked O
me O
to O
take O
no O
heed O
of O
them O
and O
let O
them O
calm O
down O
first B-ORDINAL
. O

So O
I O
did O
n't O
take O
their O
words O
seriously O
but O
still O
felt O
angry O
. O

Out O
of O
my O
expectation O
, O
a O
phone O
call O
on O
the O
third B-ORDINAL
day O
completely O
changed O
my O
original O
idea O
. O

The O
telephone O
rang O
just O
as O
I O
was O
about O
to O
go O
to O
work O
in O
the O
morning O
. O

I O
thought O
it O
was O
a O
sales O
call O
and O
was O
prepared O
to O
end O
it O
perfunctorily O
. O

Unexpectedly O
, O
coming O
from O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
line O
was O
a O
deep O
and O
resolute O
voice O
of O
a O
middle O
- O
aged O
man O
. O

He O
said O
in O
an O
incontestable O
tone O
that O
my O
neighbor O
had O
a O
car O
accident O
as O
a O
result O
of O
borrowing O
my O
car O
, O
which O
traumatized O
them O
both O
physically O
and O
mentally O
and O
harmed O
their O
economic O
interests O
, O
and O
as O
the O
car O
owner O
, O
they O
would O
not O
sue O
me O
if O
I O
compensated O
them O
for O
the O
hospital O
charge O
and O
the O
costs O
of O
missing O
work O
hours O
-LRB- O
three B-CARDINAL
times O
-RRB- O
, O
otherwise O
they O
would O
see O
me O
in O
court O
. O

He O
added O
that O
he O
was O
certain O
about O
the O
case O
as O
a O
lawyer O
in O
business O
for O
ten B-DATE
years I-DATE
and O
the O
compensation O
he O
requested O
could O
double O
in O
court O
. O

As O
a O
great O
Chinese B-NORP
guy O
, O
how O
could O
I O
be O
scared O
by O
a O
few O
remarks O
of O
the O
lawyer O
? O

I O
also O
took O
up O
the O
weapon O
of O
law O
for O
justice O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
I O
also O
retained O
a O
lawyer O
. O

Out O
of O
my O
expectation O
, O
my O
lawyer O
solved O
the O
problem O
by O
merely O
making O
two B-CARDINAL
phone O
calls O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
was O
to O
the O
police O
station O
, O
asking O
for O
any O
additional O
findings O
in O
the O
investigation O
report O
of O
the O
accident O
. O

There O
was O
additional O
findings O
unexpectedly O
, O
which O
were O
against O
them O
. O

Someone O
at O
the O
junk O
yard O
found O
a O
bottle O
of O
unfinished O
wine O
without O
the O
lid O
inside O
the O
car O
and O
reported O
it O
to O
the O
police O
station O
. O

The O
police O
found O
they O
put O
the O
bottle O
of O
unfinished O
wine O
in O
the O
car O
without O
the O
lid O
after O
lunch O
. O

The O
second B-ORDINAL
call O
was O
to O
their O
lawyer O
. O

So O
their O
lawyer O
dropped O
the O
lawsuit O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
they O
would O
not O
stop O
it O
there O
and O
came O
to O
discuss O
with O
me O
several O
times O
, O
sometimes O
honey O
- O
tongued O
and O
sometimes O
threatening O
. O

The O
most O
classic O
one O
was O
: O
Do O
n't O
ever O
dream O
of O
living O
a O
life O
back O
to O
China B-GPE
, O
as O
we O
have O
people O
across O
the O
country O
. O

Disgusting O
! O

Here O
comes O
the O
old O
topic O
again O
, O
are O
you O
going O
to O
lend O
your O
car O
if O
your O
neighbor O
or O
friend O
asks O
. O

I O
think O
many O
people O
will O
say O
they O
wo O
n't O
. O

I O
would O
suggest O
not O
to O
lend O
online O
. O

However O
, O
the O
Internet O
is O
after O
all O
virtual O
. O

Words O
sometimes O
have O
no O
emotions O
. O

When O
your O
seemingly O
nice O
neighbor O
, O
seemingly O
close O
friend O
, O
or O
a O
girl O
whose O
eyes O
can O
speak O
asks O
for O
it O
in O
the O
real O
world O
, O
how O
many O
people O
will O
answer O
with O
a O
" O
no O
? O
" O

Anyhow O
, O
I O
was O
not O
able O
to O
do O
that O
. O

I O
lent O
my O
car O
to O
some O
people O
in O
need O
after O
that O
, O
and O
I O
believe O
there O
are O
not O
many O
people O
like O
my O
former O
neighbor O
couple O
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
here O
is O
a O
summery O
of O
the O
loss O
of O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
sides O
: O
. O

Our O
side O
: O

Annual O

Their O

, O

for O

And O
most O
importantly O
: O
the O

and O

Recently O
, O
a O
message O
" O
Mongolian O
Parliament O
Proposes O
to O
Merge O
Mongolia O
into O
China O
" O
is O
extraordinarily O
striking O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
It O
was O
reported O
that O
State O
Great O
Hural O
of O
Mongolia O
was O
currently O
discussing O
a O
proposal O
about O
a O
plan O
for O
Mongolia O
and O
China O
to O
found O
a O
federal O
state O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
The O
Govi O
member O
first O
put O
forward O
the O
above O
plan O
in O
the O
State O
Social O
and O
Economic O
Development O
Seminar O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
On O
October O
30 O
, O
2004 O
, O
State O
Great O
Hural O
of O
Mongolia O
held O
a O
special O
discussion O
on O
the O
establishment O
of O
Sino O
- O
Mongolian O
coalition O
and O
merger O
of O
Mongolia O
into O
China O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
During O
the O
discussion O
, O
the O
Govi O
member O
proposed O
to O
merge O
Mongolia O
into O
China O
and O
build O
a O
special O
administrative O
district O
like O
Hong O
Kong O
and O
Macau O
in O
China O
, O
making O
Mongolia O
return O
to O
the O
motherland O
finally O
and O
becoming O
a O
part O
of O
China O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
As O
early O
as O
1995 O
, O
2000 O
and O
2002 O
, O
there O
were O
parliamentary O
members O
who O
kept O
proposing O
to O
join O
Mongolia O
with O
China O
, O
but O
these O
bills O
never O
get O
discussed O
due O
to O
the O
resistances O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
In O
recent O
years O
, O
Mongolian O
government O
faces O
growing O
pressure O
arising O
from O
economic O
hardship O
. O

The O
wealthy O
life O
of O
the O
Mongolian O
nationality O
in O
places O
like O
Erlian O
in O
China O
resulted O
in O
strong O
attractions O
to O
herdsmen O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
People O
including O
many O
upper O
class O
figures O
are O
increasingly O
attracted O
by O
China O
's O
economic O
growth O
, O
particularly O
the O
relative O
prosperity O
and O
affluence O
in O
Inner O
Mongolia O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
However O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
China O
's O
ambition O
to O
" O
recapture O
" O
Outer O
Mongolia O
in O
its O
political O
territory O
will O
also O
be O
very O
far O
away O
and O
even O
nearly O
impossible O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
First O
, O
there O
are O
still O
enormous O
resistances O
inside O
Mongolia O
against O
" O
returning O
" O
to O
China O
. O

Moreover O
, O
even O
the O
form O
of O
merger O
conceived O
by O
those O
" O
returnists O
" O
also O
has O
some O
divergences O
from O
China O
's O
will O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
Second O
, O
international O
resistances O
, O
including O
those O
from O
USA O
, O
Japan O
and O
particularly O
Russia O
, O
are O
sure O
to O
be O
very O
vehement O
. O

After O
all O
, O
we O
still O
need O
Russia O
's O
help O
in O
our O
international O
strategy O
and O
defense O
development O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
Third O
, O
the O
response O
of O
the O
Mongolian O
nationality O
to O
this O
issue O
can O
not O
be O
ignored O
either O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
One O
thing O
to O
point O
out O
is O
that O
the O
loyalty O
of O
China O
's O
Mongolian O
nationality O
to O
their O
country O
is O
unquestionable O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
If O
" O
Tibetan O
independence O
" O
and O
" O
Xinjiang O
independence O
" O
may O
have O
more O
or O
less O
social O
foundation O
among O
Tibetan O
and O
Xinjing O
people O
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
" O
Mongolian O
independence O
" O
is O
absolutely O
the O
mental O
masturbation O
of O
a O
tiny O
proportion O
of O
Mongolian O
intellectuals O
and O
overseas O
anti-China O
powers O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
Despite O
all O
this O
, O
many O
Mongolian O
in O
Inner O
Mongolia O
are O
not O
willing O
to O
see O
the O
complete O
disappearance O
of O
an O
independent O
Mongolia O
. O

I O
believe O
such O
sentiment O
should O
be O
understandable O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
Hastily O
" O
recapturing O
" O
Outer O
Mongolia O
may O
cause O
resistance O
among O
Inner O
Mongolian O
people O
. O

Union O
, O
Mongolia O
did O
n't O
have O
its O
own O
troops O
and O
defense O
was O
provided O
by O
the O
Soviet O
Union O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
After O
the O
disintegration O
of O
the O
Soviet O
Union O
, O
Mongolia O
started O
to O
build O
its O
compulsory O
service O
scheme O
and O
recruit O
frontier O
troops O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
However O
, O
Mongolia O
borders O
China O
and O
Russia O
only O
, O
and O
even O
all O
people O
are O
soldiers O
can O
not O
guarantee O
the O
100 O
percent O
security O
of O
its O
soil O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
Thus O
, O
it O
has O
nearly O
no O
military O
forces O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
In O
fact O
, O
the O
Soviet O
Union O
itself O
ever O
considered O
the O
incorporation O
of O
Mongolia O
as O
a O
union O
republic O
seriously O
and O
provided O
permanent O
defense O
, O
but O
gave O
it O
up O
because O
of O
the O
strong O
objection O
from O
Mongolia O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
The O
control O
of O
Russia O
over O
the O
Far O
East O
area O
was O
significantly O
reduced O
as O
a O
result O
of O
its O
domestic O
weakness O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
The O
breakdown O
of O
the O
Soviet O
Union O
had O
huge O
and O
far O
- O
reaching O
effects O
on O
China O
, O
[jeffery7373] O
and O
made O
great O
contributions O
to O
the O
whole O
world O
, O
[jeffery7373] O
and O
benefits O
Chinese O
nationalities O
a O
lot O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
The O
military O
expenditure O
for O
the O
land O
forces O
could O
be O
transferred O
to O
the O
air O
and O
naval O
forces O
, O
and O
there O
emerged O
a O
growingly O
powerful O
air O
force O
and O
blue O
ocean O
fleet O
and O
a O
relatively O
safe O
and O
peaceful O
construction O
period O
of O
several O
decades O
, O
and O
China O
can O
come O
close O
to O
the O
feasible O
action O
that O
will O
solve O
the O
Taiwan O
issue O
indeed O
, O
[jeffery7373] O
and O
the O
military O
science O
made O
substantial O
progress O
, O
and O
the O
ideologically O
blank O
area O
left O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
disintegration O
of O
the O
Soviet O
Union O
-LRB- O
these O
traditional O

of O
the O
Soviet O
Union O

influence O
like O

and O

in O
Middle O
East O
, O
and O

Cuba O
, O
Venezuela O
and O
Bolivia O
in O
Latin O
America O
-RRB- O
was O
gained O
quickly O
, O

[jeffery7373] O
This O
was O
impossible O
to O
achieve O
before O
the O
disintegration O
of O
the O
Soviet O
Union O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
Meanwhile O
, O
it O
brought O
a O
very O
rare O
opportunity O
for O
Mongolia O
's O
return O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
Although O
the O
Great O
Hural O
of O
Mongolia O
proposed O
to O
return O
to O
China O
43 O
times O
, O
China O
has O
n't O
made O
any O
positive O
comments O
and O
feedback O
so O
far O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
Voice O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
It O
is O
not O
the O
right O
time O
for O
Mongolia O
's O
return O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
Firstly O
, O
Mongolia O
's O
geographic O
location O
is O
very O
important O
and O
situated O
between O
China O
and O
Russia O
. O

If O
Mongolia O
returned O
to O
China O
, O
it O
would O
cast O
shadow O
on O
Sino O
- O
Russian O
relations O
inevitably O
and O
damage O
the O
whole O
situation O
of O
the O
Sino O
- O
Russian O
strategic O
cooperation O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
In O
the O
period O
of O
Three O
Kingdoms O
, O
Sun O
Quan O
and O
Liu O
Bei O
broke O
their O
coalition O
for O
Jing O
prefecture O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
Mongolia O
has O
an O
important O
strategic O
location O
as O
Jing O
prefecture O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
Both O
China O
and O
Russia O
develop O
friendly O
relations O
with O
Mongolia O
, O
which O
has O
positive O
impact O
on O
the O
stabilization O
of O
Sino O
- O
Russian O
borders O
and O
Mongolia O
's O
domestic O
situation O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
Otherwise O
, O
If O
Mongolia O
returned O
, O
it O
would O
make O
Russia O
feel O
facing O
a O
great O
enemy O
and O
obstruct O
the O
rise O
of O
Russia O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
A O
weak O
Russia O
allows O
USA O
to O
concentrate O
on O
threatening O
China O
, O
which O
will O
undermine O
the O
benefits O
of O
our O
great O
strategy O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
Secondly O
, O
we O
are O
not O
strong O
enough O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
Among O
many O
problems O
related O
to O
the O
reunification O
of O
the O
motherland O
, O
Mongolia O
has O
low O
priority O
, O
far O
less O
important O
than O
Taiwan O
, O
Diaoyu O
Island O
and O
South O
Sea O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
We O
can O
not O
accept O
Mongolia O
because O
of O
its O
voluntary O
return O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
Before O
these O
problems O
get O
solved O
, O
the O
timing O
of O
Mongolia O
's O
return O
can O
not O
be O
mature O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
It O
is O
quite O
simple O
. O

If O
the O
nation O
is O
not O
strong O
, O
we O
can O
not O
get O
reunified O
for O
reunification O
and O
lose O
the O
great O
opportunity O
to O
develop O
our O
strength O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
Thirdly O
, O
Mongolia O
's O
motivation O
for O
return O
is O
not O
strong O
, O
and O
its O
will O
is O
not O
firm O
and O
can O
be O
suspected O
to O
be O
a O
kind O
of O
speculation O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
Nowadays O
, O
Mongolia O
is O
developing O
friendly O
relations O
with O
both O
USA O
and O
Japan O
and O
conducted O
joint O
military O
exercises O
with O
USA O
, O
which O
has O
troops O
stationed O
in O
Mongolia O
. O

All O
these O
indicate O
that O
Mongolia O
's O
return O
may O
be O
a O
giant O
alienating O
conspiracy O
, O
the O
purpose O
of O
which O
is O
to O
make O
China O
and O
Russia O
suspect O
each O
other O
and O
fight O
against O
each O
other O
for O
Mongolia O
and O
lose O
cooperation O
and O
trust O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
Fourthly O
, O
for O
China O
and O
Russia O
, O
they O
should O
develop O
their O
relations O
with O
Mongolia O
jointly O
and O
expel O
the O
forces O
of O
USA O
and O
Japan O
out O
of O
Mongolia O
. O

This O
is O
what O
we O
should O
do O
, O
[jeffery7373] O
rather O
than O
accept O
Mongolia O
's O
hesitant O
return O
blindly O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
Offering O
to O
ally O
with O
Russia O
, O
reaching O
its O
understanding O
and O
developing O
relations O
with O
Mongolia O
, O
are O
our O
best O
strategy O
. O

[jeffery7373] O
Therefore O
, O
we O
are O
patriots O
but O
not O
blind O
ones O
. O

Only O
if O
we O
have O
strategic O
thinking O
, O
consider O
the O
long O
- O
term O
stability O
and O
security O
of O
the O
country O
, O
and O
consider O
the O
international O
situations O
, O
we O
can O
make O
the O
best O
decision O
. O

[saite] O
Without O
doubt O
, O
the O
strategic O
location O
of O
Mongolia O
is O
more O
important O
than O
Taiwan O
. O

[saite] O
If O
Mongolia O
can O
be O

, O
it O
deserves O
high O
priority O
. O

[saite] O
In O
fact O
, O
the O

all O

the O

On O

, O
State O
Great O
Hural O

[saite] O
: O
held O
a O
special O
discussion O
on O
the O
establishment O
of O

Mongolian O

and O
merger O
of O

During O
the O

, O
the O
Govi O

[saite] O

proposed O
to O

[saite] O

but O
these O

In O

The O

Official O
data O
confirm O
that O
in O
2004 B-DATE
the O
total O
personal O
income O
tax O
for O
the O
country O
amounted O
to O
approximately B-CARDINAL
181 I-CARDINAL
billion I-CARDINAL
, O
of O
which O
65 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
came O
from O
the O
working O
class O
, O
and O
only O
10 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
came O
from O
the O
wealthy O
. O

Clearly O
the O
personal O
income O
tax O
policy O
has O
too O
little O
effect O
on O
controlling O
wealth O
accumulation O
by O
the O
rich O
, O
and O
too O
little O
impact O
on O
improving O
the O
quality O
of O
life O
of O
wage O
earners O
. O

While O
this O
type O
of O
tax O
in O
China B-GPE
has O
no O
effect O
on O
regulating O
the O
income O
gap O
or O
on O
" O
taking O
from O
the O
rich O
to O
help O
the O
poor O
, O
" O
neither O
is O
it O
beneficial O
in O
expanding O
the O
working O
class O
. O

If O
this O
tax O
continues O
to O
be O
collected O
, O
it O
will O
be O
working O
against O
the O
original O
intention O
behind O
the O
income O
tax O
. O

Clearly O
the O
necessity O
for O
the O
personal O
income O
tax O
needs O
to O
be O
challenged O
. O

I O
propose O
eliminating O
the O
personal O
income O
tax O
just O
as O
the O
agricultural O
tax O
was O
eliminated O
, O
to O
give O
people O
an O
opportunity O
to O
prosper O
. O

If O
we O
think O
in O
terms O
of O
humanizing O
the O
system O
, O
i.e. O
, O
helping O
the O
poor O
by O
letting O
poor O
people O
get O
rich O
, O
we O
should O
give O
low O
- O
and O
moderate O
- O
income O
people O
a O
chance O
to O
improve O
and O
raise O
the O
quality O
of O
their O
lives O
; O
the O
threshold O
for O
China B-GPE
's O
personal O
income O
tax O
should O
be O
at O
least O
tripled O
from O
the O
starting O
threshold O
of O
800 B-MONEY
yuan I-MONEY
per O
month O
, O
i.e. O
, O
to O
6400 B-MONEY
yuan I-MONEY
per O
person O
. O

That O
would O
take O
it O
to O
a O
minimally O
humanized O
level O
, O
and O
then O
we O
could O
really O
talk O
about O
" O
people O
first B-ORDINAL
. O
" O

With O
a O
threshold O
below O
this O
level O
, O
the O
poor O
will O
always O
be O
poor O
. O

Yesterday O
CCTV B-ORG
presented O
a O
program O
on O
adjustment O
of O
the O
personal O
income O
tax O
, O
emphasized O
that O
the O
main O
goal O
of O
the O
adjustment O
was O
to O
" O
take O
from O
the O
rich O
" O
and O
let O
poor O
people O
get O
wealthy O
. O

If O
we O
really O
want O
to O
give O
poor O
people O
a O
chance O
to O
get O
wealthy O
, O
the O
threshold O
for O
the O
personal O
income O
tax O
should O
be O
tripled O
. O

With O
anything O
under O
this O
threshold O
, O
the O
poor O
will O
have O
no O
chance O
to O
get O
rich O
. O

And O
if O
we O
're O
looking O
at O
it O
in O
terms O
of O
" O
taking O
from O
the O
rich O
, O
" O
the O
problem O
to O
be O
adjusted O
is O
definitely O
not O
whether O
or O
not O
to O
tax O
income O
but O
rather O
the O
problem O
of O
the O
actual O
method O
for O
distributing O
China B-GPE
's O
social O
national O
income O
, O
namely O
how O
to O
eliminate O
the O
" O
unreported O
income O
. O
" O

The O
income O
of O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
China B-GPE
's O
rich O
people O
is O
unreported O
income O
, O
and O
unreported O
income O
is O
a O
problem O
that O
Chinese B-NORP
society O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
solve O
for O
quite O
a O
long O
time O
to O
come O
; O
it O
is O
a O
characteristic O
of O
China B-GPE
, O
an O
uncontrollable O
black O
hole O
in O
China B-GPE
's O
social O
oversight O
. O

This O
is O
far O
from O
being O
a O
tax O
problem O
; O
it O
is O
a O
deeper O
systemic O
problem O
. O

If O
China B-GPE
's O
personal O
income O
tax O
can O
not O
achieve O
the O
effect O
of O
helping O
the O
poor O
to O
become O
rich O
, O
neither O
can O
it O
control O
the O
excessive O
incomes O
of O
the O
wealthy O
, O
so O
what O
is O
it O
we O
expect O
this O
personal O
income O
tax O
to O
do O
? O

It O
would O
be O
better O
to O
eliminate O
it O
in O
one B-CARDINAL
fell O
swoop O
, O
as O
we O
did O
with O
the O
agricultural O
tax O
. O

Below O
are O
some O
of O
the O
main O
reasons O
: O

1. B-CARDINAL
China B-GPE
's O
income O
tax O
can O
not O
become O
a O
tool O
for O
keeping O
the O
poor O
perpetually O
poor O
; O
it O
can O
not O
become O
a O
social O
tool O
that O
keeps O
on O
producing O
a O
penniless O
proletariat O
. O

In O
China B-GPE
the O
primary O
function O
of O
the O
income O
tax O
is O
to O
increase O
the O
state O
's O
financial O
revenues O
; O
it O
is O
not O
to O
regulate O
the O
income O
gap O
. O

In O
2004 B-DATE
China B-GPE
's O
income O
taxes O
amounted O
to O
approximately B-CARDINAL
180 I-CARDINAL
billion I-CARDINAL
, O
accounting O
for O
about B-PERCENT
6 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
the O
state O
's O
financial O
revenues O
. O

But O
of O
this O
180 B-CARDINAL
billion I-CARDINAL
, O
about B-PERCENT
65 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
, O
or O
117 B-CARDINAL
billion I-CARDINAL
, O
was O
paid O
by O
the O
working O
class O
. O

Less B-PERCENT
than I-PERCENT
10 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
was O
paid O
by O
the O
wealthy O
. O

In O
China B-GPE
more B-PERCENT
than I-PERCENT
90 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
the O
people O
who O
depend O
on O
fully O
declared O
total O
earnings O
for O
a O
living O
are O
urban O
poor O
. O

These O
poor O
people O
, O
who O
struggle O
just O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
necessities O
of O
life O
, O
their O
children O
's O
education O
, O
old O
age O
, O
illness O
and O
death O
, O
also O
have O
to O
pay O
income O
tax O
. O

In O
all O
of O
China B-GPE
's O
cities O
now O
, O
anyone O
with O
a O
monthly O
income O
of O
2000 B-MONEY
yuan I-MONEY
or I-MONEY
less I-MONEY
is O
considered O
poor O
. O

If O
a O
husband O
and O
wife O
have O
a O
total O
monthly O
work O
income O
of O
2000 B-MONEY
yuan I-MONEY
, O
and O
if O
they O
pay O
33 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
income O
tax O
on O
anything O
over B-MONEY
1500 I-MONEY
yuan I-MONEY
, O
they O
have O
a O
disposable O
income O
of O
only O
1670 B-MONEY
yuan I-MONEY
. O

A O
household O
like O
this O
can O
not O
even O
continue O
bearing O
basic O
living O
expenses O
, O
and O
their O
standard O
of O
living O
will O
decline O
. O

And O
should O
anyone O
in O
the O
household O
get O
sick O
and O
have O
to O
go O
to O
the O
hospital O
, O
the O
family O
may O
well O
find O
itself O
in O
an O
economic O
crisis O
. O

And O
if O
a O
family O
like O
this O
wants O
to O
buy O
its O
own O
home O
, O
that O
will O
basically O
be O
impossible O
. O

And O
if O
only O
one B-CARDINAL
person O
in O
a O
three B-CARDINAL
- O
person O
family O
is O
employed O
, O
the O
family O
will O
have O
a O
very O
difficult O
life O
. O

But O
even O
so O
, O
they O
have O
to O
pay O
165 B-MONEY
yuan I-MONEY
in O
income O
tax O
. O

Clearly O
, O
if O
our O
income O
tax O
threshold O
is O
set O
at O
1500 B-MONEY
yuan I-MONEY
, O
our O
society O
is O
destined O
always O
to O
produce O
a O
proletariat O
, O
always O
to O
deny O
hope O
to O
the O
poor O
or O
to O
the O
masses O
of O
ever O
getting O
rich O
. O

Our O
production O
relations O
are O
no O
different O
from O
the O
production O
relations O
in O
Marx B-PERSON
's O
" O
Das B-WORK_OF_ART
Kapital I-WORK_OF_ART
, O
" O
constantly O
reproducing O
a O
proletariat O
who O
can O
only O
rely O
on O
selling O
its O
labor O
to O
make O
a O
living O
. O

In O
short O
, O
if O
the O
personal O
income O
tax O
threshold O
is O
set O
lower O
than O
6400 B-MONEY
yuan I-MONEY
, O
it O
will O
be O
ineffective O
in O
helping O
the O
poor O
get O
rich O
. O

Conversely O
, O
if O
the O
threshold O
is O
too O
low O
, O
it O
will O
cleanly O
and O
quickly O
inhibit O
the O
ability O
of O
poor O
people O
to O
get O
rich O
. O

2. B-CARDINAL
The O
personal O
income O
tax O
is O
absolutely O
unable O
to O
control O
the O
accumulation O
of O
wealth O
by O
the O
rich O
. O

We O
should O
not O
entertain O
any O
illusions O
that O
China B-GPE
's O
income O
tax O
can O
in O
any O
way O
regulate O
income O
distribution O
, O
much O
less O
that O
it O
can O
" O
take O
from O
the O
rich O
and O
give O
to O
the O
poor O
. O

In O

society O

20 B-PERCENT

the O

In O

freedom O

all O
the O

benefits O
that O
society O
can O
offer O
refer O
only O
to O
20 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
the O
people O
. O

Western O
countries O
that O
attack O
China B-GPE
for O
not O
having O
human O
rights O
, O
democracy O
and O
freedom O
are O
quite O
wrong O
; O
these B-PERCENT
20 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
upper O
- O
class O
citizens O
have O
broader O
human O
rights O
, O
democracy O
and O
freedom O
than O
do O
Western O
societies O
. O

When O
God O
looks O
at O
China B-GPE
, O
he O
sees O
only O
these B-PERCENT
20 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
; O
the O
other O
80 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
he O
ca O
n't O
see O
clearly O
. O

The O
income O
of O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
these O
20 B-CARDINAL
, O
of O
upper O
- O
class O
citizens O
in O
China B-GPE
is O
basically O
unreported O
income O
; O
the O
proportion O
of O
their O
income O
that O
comes O
from O
fully O
declared O
earnings O
is O
a O
negligible O
part O
of O
their O
wealth O
. O

Only O
if O
China B-GPE
eliminated O
unreported O
income O
would O
the O
income O
tax O
have O
an O
effect O
on O
rich O
people O
. O

And O
if O
China B-GPE
wants O
to O
eliminate O
unreported O
income O
, O
to O
date O
there O
is O
no O
sign O
of O
that O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
compelling O
evidence O
to O
explain O
when O
China B-GPE
might O
eliminate O
unreported O
income O
. O

Anyhow O
, O
it O
is O
not O
something O
our O
generation O
will O
see O
. O

That O
is O
why O
the O
income O
tax O
has O
no O
effect O
on O
regulating O
the O
wealth O
of O
China B-GPE
's O
rich O
people O
. O

It O
does O
however O
have O
a O
highly O
restrictive O
effect O
on O
the O
ability O
of O
poor O
people O
to O
get O
rich O
. O

A O
very O
simple O
explanation O
is O
that O
poor O
people O
are O
all O
wage O
earners O
who O
rely O
on O
fully O
declared O
wages O
for O
their O
living O
; O
they O
do O
not O
have O
unreported O
income O
. O

Fully O
100 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
their O
income O
falls O
within O
the O
income O
- O
tax O
field O
of O
vision O
, O
so O
they O
ca O
n't O
escape O
even O
if O
they O
wanted O
to O
. O

Add O
to O
this O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
threshold O
is O
under O
the O
level O
required O
to O
meet O
the O
necessary O
expenditures O
to O
maintain O
the O
basic O
necessities O
of O
life O
, O
and O
the O
poor O
are O
completely O
stymied O
. O

" O

" O
The O

of O

are O
always O

" O

With O
the O
previous O

threshold O
, O
if O
it O
were O
strictly O
enforced O
, O
80 B-PERCENT

of O

would O
have O
to O
pay O
. O

With O
a O
threshold O
set O
below O
5000 B-MONEY
yuan I-MONEY
, O
this O
generation O
of O
poor O
people O
need O
not O
think O
about O
buying O
a O
home O
or O
driving O
a O
car O
. O

They O
will O
always O
be O
poor O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
many O
children O
of O
poor O
people O
are O
able O
to O
get O
rich O
, O
but O
this O
came O
about O
because O
the O
parents O
struggled O
harder O
, O
tightening O
their O
belts O
and O
" O
skimping O
on O
food O
and O
clothing O
" O
for O
themselves O
. O

Now O
how O
many O
university O
students O
who O
have O
received O
acceptance O
notifications O
are O
unable O
to O
enroll O
, O
and O
how O
many O
enrolled O
university O
students O
from O
the O
countryside O
have O
parents O
who O
are O
living O
through O
unimaginably O
hard O
times O
? O

In O
Western O
countries O
, O
the O
personal O
income O
tax O
is O
the O
most O
effective O
means O
of O
controlling O
excessively O
high O
incomes O
among O
the O
rich O
. O

But O
these O
are O
countries O
ruled O
by O
law O
, O
where O
official O
income O
is O
all O
recorded O
, O
citizen O
's O
incomes O
are O
fully O
transparent O
, O
and O
therefore O
the O
personal O
income O
tax O
can O
easily O
achieve O
the O
effect O
of O
regulating O
income O
distribution O
. O

The O
situation O
in O
China B-GPE
is O
not O
like O
that O
; O
if O
the O
personal O
income O
tax O
has O
an O
effect O
, O
it O
's O
to O
increase O
financial O
revenues O
, O
and O
it O
has O
absolutely O
no O

- O
regulating O
effect O
. O

Eliminating O
the O
income O

will O
benefit O
peasants O
. O

The O
vast O
majority O
of O
China O

900 B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
peasants O
are O
unable O
to O
reach O
the O

But O
the O

have O

they O
have O
a O
low O

rural O

and O
they O

But O
if O

do O
n't O
have O

everything O
is O
a O

If O
they O

they O
have O

pay O

They O

not O

the O

they O

In O
terms O
of O
macroeconomic O

, O
the O
distribution O
of O

in O
Chinese B-NORP
society O
is O
set O
at O
2/8 B-CARDINAL

with O
the B-PERCENT

of O

20 B-PERCENT

The O

is O

the O

participating O
in O
the B-PERCENT
20 I-PERCENT

that O

even O

the O

to O
get O
a O

If O
we O

the O

for O
this B-PERCENT

which O
will O

In O

the O

This O

In O

China B-GPE
's O

of O

has O
been O
higher O
than O

this O
is O
a O

and O
in O

it O

If O

we O

in O
