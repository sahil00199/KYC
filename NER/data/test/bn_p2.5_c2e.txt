have O
also O
held O
a O
joint O
press O
conference O
to O
appeal O
to O
the O
public O
to O
remain O
calm O
. O

According O
to O
a O
BBC B-ORG
report O
on O
the O
nineteenth B-ORDINAL
, O
a O
study O
group O
composed O
of O
American B-NORP
and O
Russian B-NORP
scientists O
recently O
discovered O
several O
kinds O
of O
microbes O
composed O
of O
special O
substances O
. O

Following O
their O
research O
, O
the O
scientists O
made O
a O
bold O
supposition O
: O
that O
some O
of O
the O
earliest O
simple O
life O
forms O
on O
Earth B-LOC
were O
very O
likely O
attached O
to O
meteorites O
from O
Mars B-LOC
that O
came O
to O
Earth B-LOC
. O

In O
their O
research O
, O
the O
American B-NORP
and O
Russian B-NORP
scientists O
discovered O
that O
these O
special O
microbes O
can O
live O
even O
after O
being O
exposed O
to O
radiation O
thousands O
of O
times O
greater O
than O
the O
radiation O
the O
human O
body O
can O
withstand O
. O

Because O
of O
this O
, O
they O
think O
that O
these O
special O
and O
rare O
microbes O
have O
already O
gained O
some O
kind O
of O
ability O
to O
resist O
powerful O
radiation O
while O
maintaining O
moisture O
. O

The O
scientists O
do O
not O
believe O
that O
any O
life O
forms O
originated O
on O
Earth B-LOC
would O
be O
able O
to O
develop O
these O
special O
capabilities O
. O

Because O
there O
is O
evidence O
indicating O
that O
there O
have O
not O
been O
large O
fluctuations O
in O
radiation O
levels O
on O
Earth B-LOC
during O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
four I-DATE
billion I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
they O
think O
that O
these O
super-microbes O
could O
have O
originated O
from O
Mars B-LOC
and O
come O
to O
Earth B-LOC
as O
they O
hitched O
a O
ride O
on O
meteorites O
, O
and O
ultimately O
become O
the O
earliest O
simple O
life O
forms O
on O
Earth B-LOC
. O

The O
results O
of O
their O
research O
will O
be O
published O
in O
the O
latest O
edition O
of O
the O
journal O
Astrobiology B-ORG
. O

However O
, O
many O
other O
scientists O
have O
nevertheless O
expressed O
doubts O
on O
this O
. O

Some O
scholars O
have O
pointed O
out O
that O
the O
DNA O
of O
these O
super-microbes O
does O
not O
differ O
in O
many O
ways O
from O
regular O
microbes O
. O

Other O
scientists O
have O
also O
pointed O
out O
that O
of O
the B-CARDINAL
tens I-CARDINAL
of I-CARDINAL
thousands I-CARDINAL
of O
meteorites O
already O
found O
on O
Earth B-LOC
, O
only O
twenty B-CARDINAL
or O
so O
came O
from O
Mars B-LOC
. O

Even O
if O
these O
super-microbes O
had O
existed O
on O
Mars B-LOC
, O
the O
possibility O
that O
they O
hitched O
a O
ride O
to O
Earth B-LOC
on O
meteorites O
is O
not O
very O
great O
either O
. O

Yes O
, O
well O
, O
yesterday B-DATE

During O

to O
create O
the O
electromagnetic O
environment O
for O
the O
blue O

Through O
the O

they O
chiefly O
worked O

Against O
