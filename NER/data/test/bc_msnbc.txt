they O

and O
that O
is O
we O
are O
willing O

Why O
not O
sit O

to O
them O
stop O

your O

and O
we O
'll O
sit O
down O

Well O
Tim B-PERSON
we O
're O
trying O
to O
sit O
down O
with O
the B-NORP
North I-NORP
Koreans I-NORP
in O
the O
context O
of O
the O
six B-CARDINAL
party O
talks O
/. O

We O
've O
been O
saying O
for O
months B-DATE
now O
that O
the O
right O
step O
forward O
is O
for O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
to O
return O
to O
these O
talks O
/. O

but O
we O
really O
do O
n't O
see O
the O
logic O
in O
turning O
this O
into O
a O
test O
of O
wills O
between O
two B-CARDINAL
countries O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
and O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
/. O

The O
fact O
is O
that O
China B-GPE
has O
the O
same O
interest O
as O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
/. O

It O
should O
have O
the O
same O
interest O
/. O

And O
that O
is O
to O
stop O
the O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
nuclear O
program O

Our O
allies O
Japan B-GPE

Korea I-GPE
have O
the O
same O
interests O

and O
the O
Russians B-NORP
do O
as O
well O
/. O

And O
so O
we O
think O
we O
're O
far O
better O
off O
working O
within O
the O
framework O
of O
the O
six B-CARDINAL
party O
talks O
because O
you O
get O
in O
that O
process O
the O
combined O
leverage O
the O
combined O
strength O
and O
frankly O
the O
combined O
pressure O
on O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
of O
all O
these O
different O
countries O
/. O

I O
simply O
do O
n't O
see O
why O
it O
's O
in O
the O
interest O
of O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
to O
get O
those O
countries O
out O
of O
the O
way O
and O
only O
deal O
with O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
directly O
/. O

So O
the O
problem O
here O
is O
not O
the O
lack O
of O
discussion O
between O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
and O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
/. O

We O
're O
perfectly O
willing O
to O
sit O
down O
with O
them O
in O
that O
six B-CARDINAL
party O
environment O
/. O

and O
in O
that O
sense O
it O
's O
analogous O
to O
what O
we O
're O
trying O
to O
do O
with O
Iran B-GPE
/. O

Secretary O
Rice B-PERSON
announced O
about B-DATE
a I-DATE
month I-DATE

that O
should O
the O
Iranians B-NORP
meet O
the O
condition O
of O
suspension O
of O
their O
own O
nuclear O
activities O
we O
'd O
be O
willing O

sit O
down O

another O
multilateral O
forum O

and O
that O
's O
with O
the O
Europeans B-NORP

Russians B-NORP
and O
Chinese B-NORP

So O
really O
you O
know O
the O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
problem O
is O
not O
a O
problem O
just O
for O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE

What O
they O
did O
the B-DATE
other I-DATE
day I-DATE
on O
July B-DATE
fourth I-DATE
was O
to O
disrupt O
the O
peace O

harmony O

the O
Asian B-LOC
countries O

And O
the O
Asian B-LOC
countries O
want O
to O
be O
involved O
in O
these O
negotiations O
/. O

Is O
it O
the O
policy O
of O
the O
Bush B-PERSON
administration O
that O
we O
'd O
like O
to O
see O
regime O
change O
in O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
/? O

Well O
this O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
most O
despotic O
regimes O
in O
the O
world O
/. O

it O
's O
a O
major O
human O
rights O
violator O
/. O

There O
's O
massive O
famine O
/. O

And O
certainly O
we O
hope O
for O
the O
day O
will O
come O
when O
those O
people O
will O
live O
in O
peace O
and O
be O
governed O
by O
a O
different O
type O
of O
government O
/. O

Uh O
what O
we O
've O
got O
to O
do O
now O
of O
course O
is O
focus O
on O
the O
most O
immediate O
problem O
/. O

And O
that O
problem O
is O
nuclear O
weapons O
/. O

The O
problem O
is O
the O
ballistic O
launches O
of O
the B-DATE
other I-DATE
day I-DATE
/. O

I O
think O
the O
thing O
to O
remember O
about O
those O
launches O
by O
the O
way O
they O
were O
provocative O
, O
they O
were O
reckless O
, O
they O
were O
also O
unsuccessful O
/. O

They O
fired O
four B-CARDINAL
scud O
missiles O
intermediate O
range O
missiles O
/. O

They O
tried O
to O
fire O
the O
longer O
range O

the O
/. O

and O
that O
was O
spectacularly O
unsuccessful O
/. O

It O
crashed O
in O
the B-LOC
sea I-LOC
of I-LOC
Japan I-LOC
/. O

So O
we O
obviously O
have O
an O
opportunity O
now O
for O
diplomacy O
. O
And O
an O
opportunity O
to O
use O
the O
combined O
strength O
of O
all O
these O
countries O
to O
provide O
some O
leverage O
put O
some O
leverage O
against O
the B-NORP
North I-NORP
Koreans I-NORP

and O
that O
's O
what O
we O
will O
continue O
to O
try O
to O
do O
in O
the O
coming B-DATE

coming B-DATE

Tim B-PERSON

but O
we O
see O
the B-NORP
North I-NORP
Koreans I-NORP
walking O
away O
from O
it O

So O
we O
've O
got O
to O
be O
very O
persistent O
and O
frankly O
very O
tough O
in O
combining O
with O
these O
other O
countries O
to O
pressure O
the B-NORP
North I-NORP
Koreans I-NORP

up O

we O
would O
be O
willing O

give O

The B-NORP

know O
what O
's O
in O
the O
September B-DATE
nineteenth I-DATE
agreement O

and O
it O
's O
very O
specific O
about O
what O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE

is O
willing O
to O
do O
uh O
to O
take O
a O
step O
forward O

all O

no O

both O

And O
what O
we O
've O
seen O
Tim O
especially O
on O
July B-DATE
Fourth I-DATE
is O
the B-NORP
North I-NORP
Koreans I-NORP
in O
outright O
violation O
of O
the O
agreement O
that O
we O
made O
with O
them O
last B-DATE

Why O
do O
you O
think O
the B-NORP
North I-NORP
Koreans I-NORP
chose O
July B-DATE
Fourth I-DATE
/? O

Oh O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
was O
coincidental O
/. O

You O
know O
it O
's O
a O
very O
unreliable O
and O
unpredictable O
regime O
/. O

The O
last O
thing O
we O
want O
to O
do O
is O
react O
to O
every O
wild O
statement O
that O
they O
make O

but O
they O
certainly O
chose O
that O
to O
get O
our O
attention O
and O
that O
of O
the O
international O

/. O

Uh O
but O
what O
they O
've O
got O
to O
realize O
is O
there O
is O
no O
magic O
bullet O
here O
/. O

They O
ca O
n't O
just O
think O
that O
they O
can O
sit O
down O
with O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE

alone O

That O
does O

it O

and O
frankly O
it O
does O

work O

So O
I O
said O
before O
that O
one O
of O
the O
most O
interesting O

this O
Chinese B-NORP

these O
commitments O

they O

Speaker O
Newt B-PERSON
Gingrich I-PERSON

For O
thirteen B-DATE

the B-GPE

has O
talked O
loudly O
about O
a O
North B-GPE

For O
thirteen B-DATE

the O
North B-NORP

dictatorship O
has O
lied O

hunkered O
down O

continued O
to O

The O
strategy O
of O
talking O
has O
failed O

America B-GPE

actions O
must O
be O
decisive O
or O
faced O
with O
a O
brutal O
totalitarian O
dictatorship O
about O
which O
we O
know O
little O
/. O

It O
is O
acting O
in O
defiance O
of O
all O
its O
own O
international O
commitments O
/. O

But O
the O
time O
for O
talk O
is O
over O

either O
they O
dismantle O
the O

or O
we O
the B-GPE

Well O
uh O
with O
all O
due O
respect O
to O
Speaker O
Gingrich B-PERSON
we O
are O
on O
a O
course O
which O
has O
a O
reasonable O
chance O

success O
/. O

And O
you O
never O
want O
to O
disavow O
a O
diplomatic O
track O
a O
negotiating O
track O
if O
you O
think O
you O
can O
resolve O
the O
problem O
in O
that O
fashion O

And O
as O
I O
said O
before O
we O
are O
not O
alone O
in O
this O
endeavor O
/. O

we O
have O
countries O
united O
with O
us O
who O
can O
apply O
the O

type O

I O
will O
say O
this O
what O
the B-NORP
North I-NORP
Koreans I-NORP
have O
done O
over O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
week I-DATE
is O
going O
to O
give O
a O
lot O
of O
strength O
in O
our O
efforts O
to O
develop O
a O

system O
/. O

You O
've O
seen O
very O
strong O
statements O
by O
the O
Japanese B-NORP
government O
wanting O
to O
work O
with O
us O
in O
that O
realm O
/. O

So O
obviously O
we O
're O
going O
to O
pursue O
a O
very O
tough O
very O
decisive O
policy O
over O
the B-DATE
coming I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
designed O
to O
focus O
the B-NORP

on O
their O
obligations O

them O
to O
come O
back O

also O

to O
provide O
for O
our O
own O
defense O
and O
the O
defense O
of O
our O

And O
I O
think O
you O
'll O
see O
us O
move O
ahead O
smartly O
in O
that O
direction O
as O
well O

Uh O
Mister O

many O

George B-PERSON

the O
six B-CARDINAL

The O

his O

has O
sometimes O
seemed O
ferocious O
North B-GPE

seem O
to O
have O
concluded O
that O
the O
Bush B-PERSON
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
policy O
consists O
mainly O
of O
empty O
words O

that O
oft O

By O
more O

Would O
you O

in O
the O
nuclear O

by O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
on O
the O
watch O
of O
President O
Bush B-PERSON
/? O

Tim B-PERSON
um O
obviously O
we O
profoundly O
disagree O
with O
um O
some O
of O
the O
statements O
that O
we O
've O
just O
heard O
/. O

Eh O
you O
know O
we O
've O
got O
a O
very O
strong O
military O
force O
and O
deterrent O
force O
at O
work O
in O
Asia B-LOC
and O
particularly O
on O
the B-LOC
Korean I-LOC
peninsula I-LOC
/. O

And O
that O
military O
can O
handle O
any O
contingency O
that O
should O
arise O
/. O

We O
also O
have O
a O
very O
tough O
policy O
and O
I O
think O
forward O
looking O
policy O
to O
develop O
missile O
defense O
to O
handle O
those O
contingencies O
/. O

But O
you O
've O
got O
to O
combine O
military O
measures O
with O
diplomacy O
to O
be O
effective O
in O
a O
situation O
like O
this O
/. O

The O
fact O
is O
that O
a O
lot O
of O
this O
criticism O
seems O
to O
direct O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
back O
to O
a O
test O
of O
wills O
bilaterally O
between O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
and O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
/. O

What O
we O
want O
to O
do O
is O
we O
want O
to O
ask O
countries O
that O
do O
have O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
influence O
on O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
certainly O
more O
than O
we O
have O
to O
use O
that O
influence O
/. O

We O
can O
do O
that O
by O
channeling O
those O
efforts O
through O
the O
six B-CARDINAL
party O
framework O
/. O

And O
you O
know O
diplomacy O
sometimes O
ca O
n't O
succeed O
in O
a B-DATE
day I-DATE
or I-DATE
two I-DATE
or O
a B-DATE
week I-DATE
or I-DATE
two I-DATE
/. O

Sometimes O
it O
takes O
many B-DATE
months I-DATE
or O
even O
years B-DATE
to O
succeed O
/. O

But O
if O
you O
have O
the O
right O
policy O
in O

, O
if O
you O
know O
what O
you O
're O
trying O

accomplish O

if O
you O
're O
very O
tough O

minded O
about O
applying O
that O
policy O
we O
can O
be O
successful O
/. O

So O
we O
have O
not O
given O
up O
hope O
that O
we O
can O
engineer O
a O
policy O
that O
will O
effectively O
put O
the B-NORP
North I-NORP
Koreans I-NORP
back O
in O
the O
box O
take O
away O
their O
nuclear O
programs O
and O
take O
away O
their O
ability O
to O
inflict O
threats O
and O
damage O
on O
their O
neighbors O

We O
have O
got O
to O
be O
single O

minded O
about O
this O
/. O

we O
certainly O
understand O
the O
gravity O
of O
a O
challenge O
posed O
by O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
/. O

but O
frankly O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
these O
critics O
have O
offered O
any O
alternative O
that O
would O
have O
a O
reasonable O
prospect O
of O
success O

lead O
us O
to O
unintended O
consequences O
uh O
if O
you O
went O
down O
the O
road O
that O
some O
of O

are O
suggesting O

And O
we O
think O
we O
've O

the O
right O
policy O

and O
I O
can O
assure O
you O
we O
're O
going O
to O
drive O
with O
a O
great O

energy O

determination O

But O
you O
do O
not O
deny O
that O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE

nuclear O
capability O
has O
increased O
during O
the O

Well O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
says O
that O
it O
has O
a O
nuclear O

and O
we O
believe O
that O
it O
has O
produced O
that O
over O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
several I-DATE

and O
that O
's O
why O
we O

put O

this O

take O
it O
away O

And O
if O
we O
can O
have O
the O
September B-DATE
nineteenth I-DATE
two I-DATE
thousand I-DATE
five I-DATE
agreement O
implemented O
it O
will O
do O
just O
that O

It O
will O
effectively O
de-nuclearize O

And O
so O
that O
is O
a O
good O
bet O
for O
the B-GPE

It O
's O
obviously O
the O
goal O

I O
think O
all O

we O

there O

Since O

that O
somehow O
because O
we O
have O
n't O
come O
to O
the O
end O
of O
negotiations O
these O
negotiations O
are O
bound O
to O
fail O

You O
've O
got O
to O
be O
very O
purposeful O
and O
directed O
in O
what O
you O
're O
trying O
to O
do O

apply O
the O
weight O

that O

what O

We O
have O
not O
given O
up O
on O
this O
quest O
to O
come O
to O
the O
end O
of O
these O
negotiations O
and O
put O
the B-NORP

back O

a O

no O

be O
a O

to O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
/. O

But O
again O
it O
's O
the O
tone O
and O
the O
rhetoric O
/. O

Let O
me O
go O
back O
and O
review O
some O
of O
the O
things O
the O
President O
has O
said O
about O
Kim B-PERSON
Jong I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Il I-PERSON
of O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
/. O

I O
loathe O
Kim B-PERSON
Jong I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Il I-PERSON
/. O

I O
got O
a O
visceral O
reaction O
to O
this O
guy O
/. O

And O
then O
in O
two B-DATE
thousand I-DATE
four I-DATE
there O
's O
a O
tyrant O
in O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
that O
wants O
to O
develop O
a O
nuclear O
weapon O
/. O

And O
then O
this O
in O
two B-DATE
thousand I-DATE
two I-DATE
/. O

the O
President O
called O
him O
a O
pygmy O
And O
compared O
him O
to O
a O
spoiled O
child O
at O
a O
dinner O
table O
/. O

Does O
the O
President O
still O
believe O
that O
Kim B-PERSON
Jong I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Il I-PERSON
is O
a O
tyrant O
a O
pygmy O
and O
a O
spoiled O
child O
/. O

Kim B-PERSON
Jong I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Il I-PERSON
is O
a O
despot O
/. O

And O
he O
is O
someone O
who O
is O
one O
of O
the O
worst O
offenders O
of O
human O
rights O
all O
over O
the O
world O
/. O

Uh O
these O
missile O
tests O
the B-DATE
other I-DATE
day I-DATE
were O
certainly O
reckless O
/. O

They O
were O
provocative O
/. O

And O
so O
uh O
we O
have O
n't O
changed O
our O
opinion O
of O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
regime O
in O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
/. O

No O
one O
in O
our O
government O
has O
/. O

We O
are O
very O
clear O
- O
eyed O
about O
who O
they O
are O
, O
what O
they O
represent O
, O
how O
much O
they O
've O
denied O
their O
own O
people O
the O
basic O
human O
rights O
that O
people O
should O
have O
around O
the O
world O
/. O

And O
we O
're O
focused O
on O
this O
nuclear O
question O
as O
well O
/. O

So O
I O
think O
there O
's O
been O
a O
lot O
of O
continuity O
over O
American B-NORP
policy O
both O
in O
the O
substance O
of O
the O
policy O
and O
in O
the O
way O
we O
've O
talked O
about O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
over O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
several I-DATE
years I-DATE
/. O

And O
uh O
we O
're O
determined O
to O
press O
ahead O
/. O

When O
the O
president O
talked O
about O
the O
axis O
of O
evil O
he O
said O
Iraq B-GPE
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
and O
Iran B-GPE
/. O

The B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
invaded O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
those O
countries O
Iraq B-GPE
/. O

Some O
now O
make O
the O
case O
that O
Iran B-GPE
and O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
took O
from O
that O
the O
following O
lesson O
that O
if O
you O
develop O
a O
nuclear O
bomb O
and O
have O
a O
strong O
military O
you O
will O
not O
be O
invaded O
by O
the O
US B-GPE
/. O

And O
both O
of O
those O
countries O
have O
clearly O
miscalculated O
their O
own O
situation O
/. O

Now O
the B-NORP
North I-NORP
Koreans I-NORP
felt O
I O
guess O
that O
by O
testing O
these O
ballistic O
missiles O
they O
would O
somehow O
put O
themselves O
in O
a O
position O
of O
greater O
weight O
in O
the O
negotiations O
/. O

They O
've O
miscalculated O
because O
you O
've O
seen O
very O
tough O
statements O
from O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
and O
the O
Russians B-NORP
and O
the B-NORP
South I-NORP
Koreans I-NORP
and O
the O
Japanese B-NORP
against O
what O
they O
've O
done O
/. O

and O
you O
see O
momentum O
building O
in O
the O
UN B-ORG
security O
council O
toward O
a O
very O
tough O
chapter B-LAW
seven I-LAW
resolution O
against O
them O
/. O

The O
Iranians B-NORP
have O
miscalculated O
/. O

They O
thought O
that O
they O
could O
divide O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
from O
both O
our O
European B-NORP
allies O
and O
from O
Russia B-GPE
and O
China B-GPE
/. O

But O
we O
've O
been O
able O
to O
craft O
a O
major O
and O
united O
coalition O
of O
all O
those O
countries O
/. O

And O
we O
've O
essentially O
given O
the O
Iranians B-NORP
a O
clear O
choice O
/. O

And O
you O
'll O
see O
a O
lot O
of O
this O
unfold O
this B-DATE
week I-DATE
both O
in O

when O

the B-DATE

the O

after O
they O
suspend O
their O
nuclear O
programs O
or O
further O
action O
in O
the B-ORG
Security I-ORG

/. O

So O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
either O
of O
these O
countries O
is O
on O
the O
offensive O
/. O

Frankly O
I O
think O
both O

rather O
cornered O

isolated O

There O
are O
very O
few O
countries O
defending O
them O
/. O

and O
they O
're O
running O
out O

So O
we O
think O
this O
policy O
of O
patient O
diplomacy O

of O
crafting O
multilateral O
coalitions O
to O
tighten O
the O
pressure O
around O
them O

going O

And O
it O
's O
the O
right O
way O
to O
go O
clearly O
for O
the B-GPE

we O
want O
to O
exhaust O
diplomatic O

Let O

go O
back O
to O
the O
logic O
of O
the O
six B-CARDINAL

in O
the O
first B-ORDINAL

/. O

The O
reason O
to O
have O
everybody O
at O
the O
table O
with O
the B-NORP
North I-NORP
Koreans I-NORP
is O
not O
only O
that O
they O
have O
a O

the O
outcome O

well O

uh O
in O
dealing O
with O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
diplomacy O
has O
to O
have O
a O
coercive O
dimension O
/. O

And O
we O
do O
n't O
trade O
with O
North B-GPE

we O
do O
n't O
recognize O
North B-GPE

diplomatically O

uh O
there O

almost O
nothing O
we O
can O
do O
short O
of O
military O
action O
to O
apply O
pressure O
to O
North B-GPE

We O
're O
capable O
of O
military O
action O

and O
it O
's O
important O
that O
that O
be O
an O
ingredient O
of O
course O
in O
diplomacy O
/. O

But O
the O
real O
levers O
on O
Kim B-PERSON
Jong I-PERSON

are O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
and O
the B-NORP
South I-NORP
Koreans I-NORP

It O
is O
they O
who O
essentially O
support O
the O
regime O

politically O

But O
makes O
sense O
to O
have O
them O
at O
the O
table O

The O
six B-CARDINAL
party O
talks O
I O
totally O
agree O
with O
my O
colleagues O
here O
have O
produced O
nothing O
so O
far O
except O
a O
quadrupling O
of O
the O
amount O
of O

hands O

they O
've O
been O
running O
wild O

three B-DATE

Um O
the O
reason O
for O
that O
/- O

there O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
blame O
to O
go O
around O

you O
have O
to O
start O
with O
the B-NORP
North I-NORP
Koreans I-NORP

their O
own O
intransigence O

The O
Chinese B-NORP

the B-NORP

not O

I O
think O
on O
our O
side O

it O
matters O
less O
who O

at O
the O

that O
we O
have O
our O
own O
wits O
about O
us O

we O
sit O
down O
with O
the B-NORP
North I-NORP

And O
our O
government O
I O
believe O
has O
been O
divided O
over O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
few I-DATE
years I-DATE
as O
the O
six B-CARDINAL
party O
talks O
between O
two B-CARDINAL
camps O

One B-CARDINAL
camp O

believes O
that O

have O
to O
give O
diplomacy O
a O
try O

is O
earnest O
about O
pursuing O
diplomacy O
with O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE

But O
there O
's O
another O
camp O
uh O
in O
this O
country O
and O
I O
think O
represented O
in O
the O
government O
that O
believes O
that O
negotiating O
with O
the B-NORP
North I-NORP
Koreans I-NORP
is O
a O
fools O
game O

is O
even O
immoral O
because O
of O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
regime O

I O
do O
n't O
agree O

that O
view O

I O
think O
it O

more O
immoral O

go O
nuclear O

to O
try O

reach O
a O

with O
North B-GPE

we O
have O
been O

two B-CARDINAL

therefore O
I O
do O

think O
we O
at O

effective O

might O

you O
showed O

at O

think O
if O

that O

one B-CARDINAL

second B-ORDINAL
is O

objection O

request O
for O
a O
light O
water O

I O

bogged O

by O
the O
way O

believe O
you O
could O
have O
a O
separate O

also O
continue O
the O

cheating O

and O
the O
reason O
that O
you O
have O

that O
you O
do O

make O
them O

we O

found O
out O

the O

end O

We O

over O

'll O
do O
what O
the O

did O

what O
the O
Iranians B-NORP
appear O
to O
be O
wanting O
to O
do O

put O
together O
this O

they O
never O

we O

they O

And O
afterwards O

I O
believe O

allowed O

collapse O

we O
find O

freed O

they O

we O

with O

I O

concerned O
that O

we O

giving O
a O

to O

intolerable O

we O
tolerate O

That O

why O
I O

at O

you O
have O
to O
draw O
the O
line O
with O
the B-NORP

I O
do O

agree O

an O

Bob B-PERSON

all O

have O

So O
we O
were O
better O
off O

It O
is O
possible O
to O
reach O
agreement O
with O
the B-NORP

not O
when O
they O
see O
the O
kind O
of O

I O
think O
our O
diplomacy O
has O
to O

carrots O
in O
it O

it O
has O
to O
stand O
somewhere O

as O
I O
suggested O

take O
a O

Governor O

How O
do O
you O
have O
any O
strength O
in O

The B-NORP
North I-NORP
Koreans I-NORP
in O
my O
dealings O
with O
them O
they O
care O
more O
about O

they O
do O
substance O

In O
your O

care O
deeply O
about O

And O
this O
is O
another O
reason O
why O
I O
think O
for O
a O
relatively O
cheap O

a O
face O

negotiation O
at O
the O
level O
of O
Chris B-PERSON

set O
the O
stage O

a O
final O

six B-CARDINAL

is O

a O

that O
's O
in O
that O
September B-DATE

My O
point O
is O
if O
it O
's O
just O
going O
to O
be O
a O
face O
to O

meeting O
that O
serves O
as O
a O
precursor O
that O
also O
deals O
with O
this O
frozen O

issue O

has O
directly O
hit O
the O

you O
deal O

it O
to O
Iran B-GPE

think O
the O
timing O
is O
right O
for O
this O
new O
stage O
of O
direct O
negotiation O

Ambassador O
Galluci B-PERSON
based O
on O
your O
experience O
do O
you O
believe O
the B-NORP
North I-NORP
Koreans I-NORP
would O
give O
up O
their O
nuclear O

give O
up O
their O

they O
believe O
in O

is O
an O
insurance O
policy O
against O

American B-NORP
invasion O
for O
economic O
assistance O
light O
water O
reactors O
/? O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
day O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
/. O

Um O
but O
that O
leaves O
me O
to O
conclude O
since O
I O
really O
do O
n't O
know O
that O
it O
's O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
find O
out O
/. O

It O
's O
a O
good O
idea O
it O
was O
in O
nineteen B-DATE
ninety I-DATE
four I-DATE
to O
do O
a O
deal O
with O
the B-GPE
North I-GPE
that O
required O
them O
to O
give O
up O
the O

/. O

We O
did O
that O
/. O

and O
for O
a B-DATE
period I-DATE
of I-DATE
years I-DATE
we O
were O
in O
a O
position O
to O
monitor O
that O
closely O
/. O

and O
they O
did O
give O
it O
up O
/. O

Indeed O
you O
can O
make O
an O
argument O
that O
while O
the O
centrifuge O
program O
with O
the O
Pakistanis B-NORP
is O
clearly O
cheating O
was O
n't O
yet O
a O
genuine O
nuclear O
weapons O
program O
had O
n't O
produced O
anything O
and O
probably O
still O
has O
n't O
produced O
anything O

So O
you O
have O
the O
possibility O
if O
the B-NORP

thinking O
the O
way O

may O
be O
thinking O

makes O

unnecessary O

The O
only O
way O
to O
find O
