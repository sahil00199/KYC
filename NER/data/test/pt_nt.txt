The O
first O
agreement O
had O
rules O
for O
worship O
and O
a O
place O
for O
worship O
here O
on O
earth O
. O

This O
place O
was O
inside O
a O
tent O
. O

The O
first O
area O
in O
the O
tent O
was O
called O
the O
Holy O
Place O
. O

In O
the O
Holy O
Place O
were O
the O
lamp O
and O
the O
table O
with O
the O
special O
bread O
offered O
to O
God O
. O

Behind O
the O
second O
curtain O
was O
a O
room O
called O
the O
Most O
Holy O
Place O
. O

In O
the O
Most O
Holy O
Place O
was O
a O
golden O
altar O
for O
burning O
incense O
. O

And O
also O
there O
was O
the O
Box O
of O
the O
Agreement O
. O

The O
Box O
was O
covered O
with O
gold O
. O

Inside O
this O
Box O
was O
a O
golden O
jar O
of O
manna O
and O
Aaron O
's O
rod O
-- O
the O
rod O
that O
once O
grew O
leaves O
. O

Also O
in O
the O
Box O
were O
the O
flat O
stones O
with O
the O
Ten O
Commandments O
of O
the O
old O
agreement O
on O
them O
. O

Above O
the O
Box O
were O
the O
Cherub O
angels O
that O
showed O
God O
's O
glory O
. O

These O
Cherub O
angels O
were O
over O
the O
place O
of O
mercy O
. O

But O
we O
can O
not O
say O
everything O
about O
this O
now O
. O

Everything O
in O
the O
tent O
was O
made O
ready O
in O
the O
way O
I O
have O
explained O
. O

Then O
the O
priests O
went O
into O
the O
first O
room O
every O
day O
to O
do O
their O
worship O
duties O
. O

But O
only O
the O
high O
priest O
could O
go O
into O
the O
second O
room O
, O
and O
he O
went O
in O
only O
once O
a O
year O
. O

Also O
, O
he O
could O
never O
enter O
that O
room O
without O
taking O
blood O
with O
him O
. O

He O
offered O
that O
blood O
to O
God O
for O
himself O
and O
for O
the O
sins O
the O
people O
committed O
without O
knowing O
they O
were O
sinning O
. O

The O
Holy O
Spirit O
uses O
those O
two O
separate O
rooms O
to O
teach O
us O
that O
the O
way O
into O
the O
Most O
Holy O
Place O
was O
not O
open O
while O
the O
first O
room O
was O
still O
there O
. O

This O
is O
an O
example O
for O
us O
today O
. O

It O
shows O
that O
the O
gifts O
and O
sacrifices O
the O
priests O
offer O
to O
God O
are O
not O
able O
to O
make O
the O
consciences O
of O
the O
worshipers O
completely O
clear O
. O

These O
gifts O
and O
sacrifices O
are O
only O
about O
food O
and O
drink O
and O
special O
washings O
. O

They O
are O
only O
rules O
about O
the O
body O
. O

God O
gave O
them O
for O
his O
people O
to O
follow O
until O
the O
time O
of O
his O
new O
way O
. O

But O
Christ O
has O
already O
come O
to O
be O
the O
high O
priest O
. O

He O
is O
the O
high O
priest O
of O
the O
good O
things O
we O
now O
have O
. O

But O
Christ O
does O
not O
serve O
in O
a O
place O
like O
the O
tent O
that O
those O
other O
priests O
served O
in O
. O

He O
serves O
in O
a O
better O
place O
. O

Unlike O
that O
tent O
, O
this O
one O
is O
perfect O
. O

It O
was O
not O
made O
by O
anyone O
here O
on O
earth O
. O

It O
does O
not O
belong O
to O
this O
world O
. O

Christ O
entered O
the O
Most O
Holy O
Place O
only O
one O
time O
-- O
enough O
for O
all O
time O
. O

He O
entered O
the O
Most O
Holy O
Place O
by O
using O
his O
own O
blood O
, O
not O
the O
blood O
of O
goats O
or O
young O
bulls O
. O

He O
entered O
there O
and O
made O
us O
free O
from O
sin O
forever O
. O

The O
blood O
of O
goats O
and O
bulls O
and O
the O
ashes O
of O
a O
cow O
were O
sprinkled O
on O
those O
who O
were O
no O
longer O
pure O
enough O
to O
enter O
the O
place O
of O
worship O
. O

The O
blood O
and O
ashes O
made O
them O
pure O
again O
-- O
but O
only O
their O
bodies O
. O

So O
surely O
the O
blood O
sacrifice O
of O
Christ O
can O
do O
much O
more O
. O

Christ O
offered O
himself O
through O
the O
eternal O
Spirit O
as O
a O
perfect O
sacrifice O
to O
God O
. O

His O
blood O
will O
make O
us O
completely O
clean O
from O
the O
evil O
we O
have O
done O
. O

It O
will O
give O
us O
clear O
consciences O
so O
that O
we O
can O
worship O
the O
living O
God O
. O

So O
Christ O
brings O
a O
new O
agreement O
from O
God O
to O
his O
people O
. O

He O
brings O
this O
agreement O
so O
that O
those O
who O
are O
chosen O
by O
God O
can O
have O
the O
blessings O
God O
promised O
, O
blessings O
that O
last O
forever O
. O

This O
can O
happen O
only O
because O
Christ O
died O
to O
free O
people O
from O
sins O
committed O
against O
the O
commands O
of O
the O
first O
agreement O
. O

When O
someone O
dies O
and O
leaves O
a O
will O
, O
there O
must O
be O
proof O
that O
the O
one O
who O
wrote O
the O
will O
is O
dead O
. O

A O
will O
means O
nothing O
while O
the O
one O
who O
wrote O
it O
is O
still O
living O
. O

It O
can O
be O
used O
only O
after O
that O
person O
's O
death O
. O

That O
is O
why O
blood O
was O
needed O
to O
begin O
the O
first O
agreement O
between O
God O
and O
his O
people O
. O

First O
, O
Moses O
told O
the O
people O
every O
command O
in O
the O
law O
. O

Then O
he O
took O
the O
blood O
of O
young O
bulls O
and O
mixed O
it O
with O
water O
. O

He O
used O
red O
wool O
and O
a O
branch O
of O
hyssop O
to O
sprinkle O
the O
blood O
and O
water O
on O
the O
book O
of O
the O
law O
and O
on O
all O
the O
people O
. O

Then O
he O
said O
, O
`` O
This O
is O
the O
blood O
that O
makes O
the O
agreement O
good O
-- O
the O
agreement O
that O
God O
commanded O
you O
to O
follow O
. O
'' O

In O
the O
same O
way O
, O
Moses O
sprinkled O
the O
blood O
on O
the O
Holy O
Tent O
. O

He O
sprinkled O
the O
blood O
over O
everything O
used O
in O
worship O
. O

The O
law O
says O
that O
almost O
everything O
must O
be O
made O
clean O
by O
blood O
. O

Sins O
can O
not O
be O
forgiven O
without O
a O
blood O
sacrifice O
. O

These O
things O
are O
copies O
of O
the O
real O
things O
that O
are O
in O
heaven O
. O

These O
copies O
had O
to O
be O
made O
clean O
by O
animal O
sacrifices O
. O

But O
the O
real O
things O
in O
heaven O
must O
have O
much O
better O
sacrifices O
. O

Christ O
went O
into O
the O
Most O
Holy O
Place O
. O

But O
it O
was O
not O
the O
man O
- O
made O
one O
, O
which O
is O
only O
a O
copy O
of O
the O
real O
one O
. O

He O
went O
into O
heaven O
, O
and O
he O
is O
there O
now O
before O
God O
to O
help O
us O
. O

The O
high O
priest O
enters O
the O
Most O
Holy O
Place O
once O
every O
year O
. O

He O
takes O
with O
him O
blood O
to O
offer O
. O

But O
he O
does O
not O
offer O
his O
own O
blood O
like O
Christ O
did O
. O

Christ O
went O
into O
heaven O
, O
but O
not O
to O
offer O
himself O
many O
times O
like O
the O
high O
priest O
offers O
blood O
again O
and O
again O
. O

If O
Christ O
had O
offered O
himself O
many O
times O
, O
he O
would O
have O
needed O
to O
suffer O
many O
times O
since O
the O
time O
the O
world O
was O
made O
. O

But O
he O
came O
to O
offer O
himself O
only O
once O
. O

And O
that O
once O
is O
enough O
for O
all O
time O
. O

He O
came O
at O
a O
time O
when O
the O
world O
is O
nearing O
an O
end O
. O

He O
came O
to O
take O
away O
all O
sin O
by O
offering O
himself O
as O
a O
sacrifice O
. O

Everyone O
must O
die O
once O
. O

Then O
they O
are O
judged O
. O

So O
Christ O
was O
offered O
as O
a O
sacrifice O
one O
time O
to O
take O
away O
the O
sins O
of O
many O
people O
. O

And O
he O
will O
come O
a O
second O
time O
, O
but O
not O
to O
offer O
himself O
for O
sin O
. O

He O
will O
come O
the O
second O
time O
to O
bring O
salvation O
to O
those O
who O
are O
waiting O
for O
him O
. O

I O
am O
in O
Christ O
and O
I O
am O
telling O
you O
the O
truth O
. O

I O
am O
not O
lying O
. O

And O
my O
conscience O
, O
ruled O
by O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
, O
agrees O
that O
what O
I O
say O
now O
is O
true O
. O

I O
have O
great O
sorrow O
and O
always O
feel O
much O
sadness O
for O
my O
own O
people O
. O

They O
are O
my O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
, O
my O
earthly O
family O
. O

I O
wish O
I O
could O
help O
them O
. O

I O
would O
even O
have O
a O
curse O
on O
me O
and O
cut O
myself O
off O
from O
Christ O
if O
that O
would O
help O
them O
. O

They O
are O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
, O
God O
's O
chosen O
children O
. O

They O
have O
the O
glory O
of O
God O
and O
the O
agreements O
he O
made O
between O
himself O
and O
his O
people O
. O

God O
gave O
them O
the O
Law O
of O
Moses O
, O
the O
Temple O
worship O
, O
and O
his O
promises O
. O

They O
are O
the O
descendants O
of O
our O
great O
fathers O
, O
and O
they O
are O
the O
earthly O
family O
of O
Christ O
. O

And O
Christ O
is O
God O
over O
all O
things O
. O

Praise O
him O
forever O
! O

Amen O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
mean O
that O
God O
failed O
to O
keep O
his O
promise O
to O
the O
Jewish O
people O
. O

But O
only O
some O
of O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
are O
really O
God O
's O
people O
. O

And O
only O
some O
of O
Abraham O
's O
descendants O
are O
true O
children O
of O
Abraham O
. O

This O
is O
what O
God O
said O
to O
Abraham O
: O
`` O
Your O
true O
descendants O
will O
be O
those O
who O
come O
through O
Isaac O
. O
'' O

This O
means O
that O
not O
all O
of O
Abraham O
's O
descendants O
are O
God O
's O
true O
children O
. O

Abraham O
's O
true O
children O
are O
those O
who O
become O
God O
's O
children O
because O
of O
the O
promise O
he O
made O
to O
Abraham O
. O

Here O
is O
what O
God O
said O
in O
that O
promise O
: O
`` O
About O
this O
time O
next O
year O
I O
will O
come O
back O
, O
and O
Sarah O
will O
have O
a O
son O
. O
'' O

And O
that O
is O
not O
all O
. O

Rebecca O
also O
had O
sons O
, O
and O
they O
had O
the O
same O
father O
. O

He O
is O
our O
father O
Isaac O
. O

But O
before O
the O
two O
sons O
were O
born O
, O
God O
told O
Rebecca O
, O
`` O
The O
older O
son O
will O
serve O
the O
younger O
. O
'' O

This O
was O
before O
the O
boys O
had O
done O
anything O
good O
or O
bad O
. O

God O
said O
this O
before O
they O
were O
born O
so O
that O
the O
boy O
he O
wanted O
would O
be O
chosen O
because O
of O
God O
's O
own O
plan O
. O

He O
was O
chosen O
because O
he O
was O
the O
one O
God O
wanted O
to O
call O
, O
not O
because O
of O
anything O
the O
boys O
did O
. O

As O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
I O
loved O
Jacob O
, O
but O
I O
hated O
Esau O
. O
'' O

So O
what O
does O
this O
mean O
? O

That O
God O
is O
not O
fair O
? O

We O
can O
not O
say O
that O
. O

God O
said O
to O
Moses O
, O
`` O
I O
will O
show O
mercy O
to O
anyone O
I O
want O
to O
show O
mercy O
to O
. O

I O
will O
show O
pity O
to O
anyone O
I O
choose O
. O
'' O

So O
God O
will O
choose O
anyone O
he O
decides O
to O
show O
mercy O
to O
, O
and O
his O
choice O
does O
not O
depend O
on O
what O
people O
want O
or O
try O
to O
do O
. O

In O
the O
Scriptures O
God O
says O
to O
Pharaoh O
: O
`` O
I O
made O
you O
king O
so O
that O
you O
could O
do O
this O
for O
me O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
show O
my O
power O
through O
you O
. O

I O
wanted O
my O
name O
to O
be O
announced O
throughout O
the O
world O
. O
'' O

So O
God O
shows O
mercy O
to O
those O
he O
wants O
to O
show O
mercy O
to O
and O
makes O
stubborn O
those O
he O
wants O
to O
make O
stubborn O
. O

So O
one O
of O
you O
will O
ask O
me O
, O
`` O
If O
God O
controls O
what O
we O
do O
, O
why O
does O
he O
blame O
us O
for O
our O
sins O
? O
'' O

Do O
n't O
ask O
that O
. O

You O
are O
only O
human O
and O
have O
no O
right O
to O
question O
God O
. O

A O
clay O
jar O
does O
not O
question O
the O
one O
who O
made O
it O
. O

It O
does O
not O
say O
, O
`` O
Why O
did O
you O
make O
me O
like O
this O
? O
'' O

The O
one O
who O
makes O
the O
jar O
can O
make O
anything O
he O
wants O
. O

He O
uses O
the O
same O
clay O
to O
make O
different O
things O
. O

He O
might O
make O
one O
thing O
for O
special O
purposes O
and O
another O
for O
daily O
use O
. O

It O
is O
the O
same O
way O
with O
what O
God O
has O
done O
. O

He O
wanted O
to O
show O
his O
anger O
and O
to O
let O
people O
see O
his O
power O
. O

But O
he O
patiently O
endured O
those O
he O
was O
angry O
with O
-- O
people O
who O
were O
ready O
to O
be O
destroyed O
. O

He O
waited O
with O
patience O
so O
that O
he O
could O
make O
known O
the O
riches O
of O
his O
glory O
to O
the O
people O
he O
has O
chosen O
to O
receive O
his O
mercy O
. O

God O
has O
already O
prepared O
them O
to O
share O
his O
glory O
. O

We O
are O
those O
people O
, O
the O
ones O
God O
chose O
not O
only O
from O
the O
Jews O
but O
also O
from O
those O
who O
are O
not O
Jews O
. O

As O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
in O
the O
book O
of O
Hosea O
, O
`` O
The O
people O
who O
are O
not O
mine O
-- O
I O
will O
say O
they O
are O
my O
people O
. O

And O
the O
people O
I O
did O
not O
love O
-- O
I O
will O
say O
they O
are O
the O
people O
I O
love O
. O
'' O

And O
, O
`` O
Where O
God O
said O
in O
the O
past O
, O
' O
You O
are O
not O
my O
people O
' O
-- O
there O
they O
will O
be O
called O
children O
of O
the O
living O
God O
. O
'' O

And O
Isaiah O
cries O
out O
about O
Israel O
: O
`` O
There O
are O
so O
many O
people O
of O
Israel O
, O
they O
are O
like O
the O
grains O
of O
sand O
by O
the O
sea O
. O

But O
only O
a O
few O
of O
them O
will O
be O
saved O
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
Lord O
will O
quickly O
finish O
judging O
the O
people O
on O
the O
earth O
. O
'' O

It O
is O
just O
as O
Isaiah O
said O
: O
`` O
The O
Lord O
All O
- O
Powerful O
allowed O
some O
of O
our O
people O
to O
live O
. O

If O
he O
had O
not O
done O
that O
, O
we O
would O
now O
be O
like O
Sodom O
, O
and O
we O
would O
be O
like O
Gomorrah O
. O
'' O

So O
what O
does O
all O
this O
mean O
? O

It O
means O
that O
people O
who O
are O
not O
Jews O
were O
made O
right O
with O
God O
because O
of O
their O
faith O
, O
even O
though O
they O
were O
not O
trying O
to O
make O
themselves O
right O
. O

And O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
, O
who O
tried O
to O
make O
themselves O
right O
with O
God O
by O
following O
the O
law O
, O
did O
not O
succeed O
. O

They O
failed O
because O
they O
tried O
to O
make O
themselves O
right O
by O
the O
things O
they O
did O
. O

They O
did O
not O
trust O
in O
God O
to O
make O
them O
right O
. O

They O
fell O
over O
the O
stone O
that O
makes O
people O
fall O
. O

The O
Scriptures O
talk O
about O
that O
stone O
: O
`` O
Look O
, O
I O
put O
in O
Zion O
a O
stone O
that O
will O
make O
people O
stumble O
. O

It O
is O
a O
rock O
that O
will O
make O
people O
fall O
. O

But O
anyone O
who O
trusts O
in O
him O
will O
never O
be O
disappointed O
. O
'' O

I O
am O
a O
free O
man O
. O

I O
am O
an O
apostle O
. O

I O
have O
seen O
Jesus O
our O
Lord O
. O

You O
people O
are O
an O
example O
of O
my O
work O
in O
the O
Lord O
. O

Others O
may O
not O
accept O
me O
as O
an O
apostle O
, O
but O
surely O
you O
do O
. O

You O
are O
proof O
that O
I O
am O
an O
apostle O
in O
the O
Lord O
. O

Some O
people O
want O
to O
judge O
me O
. O

So O
this O
is O
the O
answer O
I O
give O
them O
: O
We O
have O
the O
right O
to O
eat O
and O
drink O
, O
do O
n't O
we O
? O

We O
have O
the O
right O
to O
bring O
a O
believing O
wife O
with O
us O
when O
we O
travel O
, O
do O
n't O
we O
? O

The O
other O
apostles O
and O
the O
Lord O
's O
brothers O
and O
Peter O
all O
do O
this O
. O

And O
are O
Barnabas O
and O
I O
the O
only O
ones O
who O
must O
work O
to O
earn O
our O
living O
? O

No O
soldier O
ever O
serves O
in O
the O
army O
and O
pays O
his O
own O
salary O
. O

No O
one O
ever O
plants O
a O
vineyard O
without O
eating O
some O
of O
the O
grapes O
himself O
. O

No O
one O
takes O
care O
of O
a O
flock O
of O
sheep O
without O
drinking O
some O
of O
the O
milk O
himself O
. O

These O
are O
n't O
just O
my O
own O
thoughts O
. O

God O
's O
law O
says O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

Yes O
, O
it O
is O
written O
in O
the O
Law O
of O
Moses O
: O
`` O

When O
a O
work O
animal O
is O
being O
used O
to O
separate O
grain O
, O
do O
n't O
keep O
it O
from O
eating O
the O
grain O
. O
'' O

When O
God O
said O
this O
, O
was O
he O
thinking O
only O
about O
work O
animals O
? O

No O
. O

He O
was O
really O
talking O
about O
us O
. O

Yes O
, O
that O
was O
written O
for O
us O
. O

The O
one O
who O
plows O
and O
the O
one O
who O
separates O
the O
grain O
should O
both O
expect O
to O
get O
some O
of O
the O
grain O
for O
their O
work O
. O

We O
planted O
spiritual O
seed O
among O
you O
, O
so O
we O
should O
be O
able O
to O
harvest O
from O
you O
some O
things O
for O
this O
life O
. O

Surely O
that O
is O
not O
asking O
too O
much O
. O

Others O
have O
this O
right O
to O
get O
things O
from O
you O
. O

So O
surely O
we O
have O
this O
right O
too O
. O

But O
we O
do O
n't O
use O
this O
right O
. O

No O
, O
we O
endure O
everything O
ourselves O
so O
that O
we O
will O
not O
stop O
anyone O
from O
obeying O
the O
Good O
News O
of O
Christ O
. O

Surely O
you O
know O
that O
those O
who O
work O
at O
the O
Temple O
get O
their O
food O
from O
the O
Temple O
. O

And O
those O
who O
serve O
at O
the O
altar O
get O
part O
of O
what O
is O
offered O
at O
the O
altar O
. O

It O
is O
the O
same O
with O
those O
who O
have O
the O
work O
of O
telling O
the O
Good O
News O
. O

The O
Lord O
has O
commanded O
that O
those O
who O
tell O
the O
Good O
News O
should O
get O
their O
living O
from O
this O
work O
. O

But O
I O
have O
not O
used O
any O
of O
these O
rights O
, O
and O
I O
am O
not O
trying O
to O
get O
anything O
from O
you O
. O

That O
is O
not O
my O
purpose O
for O
writing O
this O
. O

I O
would O
rather O
die O
than O
to O
have O
someone O
take O
away O
what O
for O
me O
is O
a O
great O
source O
of O
pride O
. O

It O
's O
not O
my O
work O
of O
telling O
the O
Good O
News O
that O
gives O
me O
any O
reason O
to O
boast O
. O

That O
is O
my O
duty O
-- O
something O
I O
must O
do O
. O

If O
I O
do O
n't O
tell O
people O
the O
Good O
News O
, O
I O
am O
in O
real O
trouble O
. O

If O
I O
did O
it O
because O
it O
was O
my O
own O
choice O
, O
I O
would O
deserve O
to O
be O
paid O
. O

But O
I O
have O
no O
choice O
. O

I O
must O
tell O
the O
Good O
News O
. O

So O
I O
am O
only O
doing O
the O
duty O
that O
was O
given O
to O
me O
. O

So O
what O
do O
I O
get O
for O
doing O
it O
? O

My O
reward O
is O
that O
when O
I O
tell O
people O
the O
Good O
News O
I O
can O
offer O
it O
to O
them O
for O
free O
and O
not O
use O
the O
rights O
that O
come O
with O
doing O
this O
work O
. O

I O
am O
free O
. O

I O
belong O
to O
no O
other O
person O
, O
but O
I O
make O
myself O
a O
slave O
to O
everyone O
. O

I O
do O
this O
to O
help O
save O
as O
many O
people O
as O
I O
can O
. O

To O
the O
Jews O
I O
became O
like O
a O
Jew O
so O
that O
I O
could O
help O
save O
Jews O
. O

I O
myself O
am O
not O
ruled O
by O
the O
law O
, O
but O
to O
those O
who O
are O
ruled O
by O
the O
law O
I O
became O
like O
someone O
who O
is O
ruled O
by O
the O
law O
. O

I O
did O
this O
to O
help O
save O
those O
who O
are O
ruled O
by O
the O
law O
. O

To O
those O
who O
are O
without O
the O
law O
I O
became O
like O
someone O
who O
is O
without O
the O
law O
. O

I O
did O
this O
to O
help O
save O
those O
who O
are O
without O
the O
law O
. O

-LRB- O
But O
really O
, O
I O
am O
not O
without O
God O
's O
law O
-- O
I O
am O
ruled O
by O
the O
law O
of O
Christ O
. O
-RRB- O

To O
those O
who O
are O
weak O
, O
I O
became O
weak O
so O
that O
I O
could O
help O
save O
them O
. O

I O
have O
become O
all O
things O
to O
all O
people O
. O

I O
did O
this O
so O
that O
I O
could O
save O
people O
in O
any O
way O
possible O
. O

I O
do O
all O
this O
to O
make O
the O
Good O
News O
known O
. O

I O
do O
it O
so O
that O
I O
can O
share O
in O
the O
blessings O
of O
the O
Good O
News O
. O

You O
know O
that O
in O
a O
race O
all O
the O
runners O
run O
, O
but O
only O
one O
runner O
gets O
the O
prize O
. O

So O
run O
like O
that O
. O

Run O
to O
win O
! O

All O
who O
compete O
in O
the O
games O
use O
strict O
training O
. O

They O
do O
this O
so O
that O
they O
can O
win O
a O
prize O
-- O
one O
that O
does O
n't O
last O
. O

But O
our O
prize O
is O
one O
that O
will O
last O
forever O
. O

So O
I O
run O
like O
someone O
who O
has O
a O
goal O
. O

I O
fight O
like O
a O
boxer O
who O
is O
hitting O
something O
, O
not O
just O
the O
air O
. O

It O
is O
my O
own O
body O
I O
fight O
to O
make O
it O
do O
what O
I O
want O
. O

I O
do O
this O
so O
that O
I O
wo O
n't O
miss O
getting O
the O
prize O
myself O
after O
telling O
others O
about O
it O
. O

In O
Jerusalem O
Saul O
was O
still O
trying O
to O
scare O
the O
followers O
of O
the O
Lord O
, O
even O
saying O
he O
would O
kill O
them O
. O

He O
went O
to O
the O
high O
priest O
and O
asked O
him O
to O
write O
letters O
to O
the O
synagogues O
in O
the O
city O
of O
Damascus O
. O

Saul O
wanted O
the O
high O
priest O
to O
give O
him O
the O
authority O
to O
find O
people O
in O
Damascus O
who O
were O
followers O
of O
the O
Way O
. O

If O
he O
found O
any O
believers O
there O
, O
men O
or O
women O
, O
he O
would O
arrest O
them O
and O
bring O
them O
back O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

So O
Saul O
went O
to O
Damascus O
. O

When O
he O
came O
near O
the O
city O
, O
a O
very O
bright O
light O
from O
heaven O
suddenly O
shined O
around O
him O
. O

He O
fell O
to O
the O
ground O
and O
heard O
a O
voice O
saying O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Saul O
, O
Saul O
! O

Why O
are O
you O
persecuting O
me O
? O
'' O

Saul O
said O
, O
`` O
Who O
are O
you O
, O
Lord O
? O
'' O

The O
voice O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
Jesus O
, O
the O
one O
you O
are O
persecuting O
. O

Get O
up O
now O
and O
go O
into O
the O
city O
. O

Someone O
there O
will O
tell O
you O
what O
you O
must O
do O
. O
'' O

The O
men O
traveling O
with O
Saul O
just O
stood O
there O
, O
unable O
to O
speak O
. O

They O
heard O
the O
voice O
, O
but O
they O
saw O
no O
one O
. O

Saul O
got O
up O
from O
the O
ground O
and O
opened O
his O
eyes O
, O
but O
he O
could O
not O
see O
. O

So O
the O
men O
with O
him O
held O
his O
hand O
and O
led O
him O
into O
Damascus O
. O

For O
three O
days O
Saul O
could O
not O
see O
; O
he O
did O
not O
eat O
or O
drink O
. O

There O
was O
a O
follower O
of O
Jesus O
in O
Damascus O
named O
Ananias O
. O

In O
a O
vision O
the O
Lord O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Ananias O
! O
'' O

Ananias O
answered O
, O
`` O
Here O
I O
am O
, O
Lord O
. O
'' O

The O
Lord O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Get O
up O
and O
go O
to O
the O
street O
called O
Straight O
Street O
. O

Find O
the O
house O
of O
Judas O
and O
ask O
for O
a O
man O
named O
Saul O
from O
the O
city O
of O
Tarsus O
. O

He O
is O
there O
now O
, O
praying O
. O

He O
has O
seen O
a O
vision O
in O
which O
a O
man O
named O
Ananias O
came O
and O
laid O
his O
hands O
on O
him O
so O
that O
he O
could O
see O
again O
. O
'' O

But O
Ananias O
answered O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
many O
people O
have O
told O
me O
about O
this O
man O
. O

They O
told O
me O
about O
the O
many O
bad O
things O
he O
did O
to O
your O
holy O
people O
in O
Jerusalem O
. O

Now O
he O
has O
come O
here O
to O
Damascus O
. O

The O
leading O
priests O
have O
given O
him O
the O
power O
to O
arrest O
all O
people O
who O
trust O
in O
you O
. O
'' O

But O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
said O
to O
Ananias O
, O
`` O
Go O
! O

I O
have O
chosen O
Saul O
for O
an O
important O
work O
. O

He O
must O
tell O
about O
me O
to O
other O
nations O
and O
their O
rulers O
and O
to O
the O
people O
of O
Israel O
. O

I O
will O
show O
him O
all O
that O
he O
must O
suffer O
for O
me O
. O
'' O

So O
Ananias O
left O
and O
went O
to O
the O
house O
of O
Judas O
. O

He O
laid O
his O
hands O
on O
Saul O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Saul O
, O
my O
brother O
, O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
sent O
me O
. O

He O
is O
the O
one O
you O
saw O
on O
the O
road O
when O
you O
came O
here O
. O

He O
sent O
me O
so O
that O
you O
can O
see O
again O
and O
also O
be O
filled O
with O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
. O
'' O

Immediately O
, O
something O
that O
looked O
like O
fish O
scales O
fell O
off O
Saul O
's O
eyes O
. O

He O
was O
able O
to O
see O
! O

Then O
he O
got O
up O
and O
was O
baptized O
. O

After O
he O
ate O
, O
he O
began O
to O
feel O
strong O
again O
. O

Saul O
stayed O
with O
the O
followers O
of O
Jesus O
in O
Damascus O
for O
a O
few O
days O
. O

Soon O
he O
began O
to O
go O
to O
the O
synagogues O
and O
tell O
people O
about O
Jesus O
. O

He O
told O
the O
people O
, O
`` O
Jesus O
is O
the O
Son O
of O
God O
! O
'' O

All O
the O
people O
who O
heard O
Saul O
were O
amazed O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
This O
is O
the O
same O
man O
who O
was O
in O
Jerusalem O
trying O
to O
destroy O
the O
people O
who O
trust O
in O
Jesus O
! O

And O
that O
's O
why O
he O
has O
come O
here O
-- O
to O
arrest O
the O
followers O
of O
Jesus O
and O
take O
them O
back O
to O
the O
leading O
priests O
. O
'' O

But O
Saul O
became O
more O
and O
more O
powerful O
in O
proving O
that O
Jesus O
is O
the O
Christ O
. O

His O
proofs O
were O
so O
strong O
that O
the O
Jews O
who O
lived O
in O
Damascus O
could O
not O
argue O
with O
him O
. O

After O
many O
days O
, O
some O
Jews O
made O
plans O
to O
kill O
Saul O
. O

They O
were O
watching O
the O
city O
gates O
day O
and O
night O
. O

They O
wanted O
to O
kill O
Saul O
, O
but O
he O
learned O
about O
their O
plan O
. O

One O
night O
some O
followers O
that O
Saul O
had O
taught O
helped O
him O
leave O
the O
city O
. O

They O
put O
him O
in O
a O
basket O
and O
lowered O
it O
down O
through O
a O
hole O
in O
the O
city O
wall O
. O

Then O
Saul O
went O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

He O
tried O
to O
join O
the O
group O
of O
followers O
, O
but O
they O
were O
all O
afraid O
of O
him O
. O

They O
did O
not O
believe O
that O
he O
was O
really O
a O
follower O
of O
Jesus O
. O

But O
Barnabas O
accepted O
Saul O
and O
took O
him O
to O
the O
apostles O
. O

He O
told O
them O
how O
Saul O
had O
seen O
the O
Lord O
on O
the O
road O
and O
how O
the O
Lord O
had O
spoken O
to O
Saul O
. O

Then O
he O
told O
them O
how O
boldly O
Saul O
had O
spoken O
for O
the O
Lord O
in O
Damascus O
. O

And O
so O
Saul O
stayed O
with O
the O
followers O
and O
went O
all O
around O
Jerusalem O
speaking O
boldly O
for O
the O
Lord O
. O

He O
often O
had O
arguments O
with O
the O
Greek O
- O
speaking O
Jews O
, O
who O
began O
making O
plans O
to O
kill O
him O
. O

When O
the O
believers O
learned O
about O
this O
, O
they O
took O
Saul O
to O
Caesarea O
, O
and O
from O
there O
they O
sent O
him O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Tarsus O
. O

The O
church O
in O
Judea O
, O
Galilee O
, O
and O
Samaria O
had O
a O
time O
of O
peace O
. O

With O
the O
help O
of O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
, O
the O
groups O
of O
believers O
became O
stronger O
and O
showed O
their O
respect O
for O
the O
Lord O
by O
the O
way O
they O
lived O
. O

So O
the O
church O
everywhere O
grew O
in O
numbers O
. O

Peter O
was O
traveling O
through O
all O
the O
areas O
around O
Jerusalem O
, O
and O
he O
stopped O
to O
visit O
the O
believers O
who O
lived O
in O
Lydda O
. O

There O
he O
met O
a O
man O
named O
Aeneas O
, O
who O
was O
paralyzed O
and O
had O
not O
been O
able O
to O
get O
out O
of O
bed O
for O
the O
past O
eight O
years O
. O

Peter O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Aeneas O
, O
Jesus O
Christ O
heals O
you O
. O

Get O
up O
and O
make O
your O
bed O
! O
'' O

He O
stood O
up O
immediately O
. O

All O
the O
people O
living O
in O
Lydda O
and O
on O
the O
plain O
of O
Sharon O
saw O
him O
, O
and O
they O
decided O
to O
follow O
the O
Lord O
. O

In O
the O
city O
of O
Joppa O
there O
was O
a O
follower O
of O
Jesus O
named O
Tabitha O
. O

Her O
Greek O
name O
, O
Dorcas O
, O
means O
`` O
a O
deer O
. O
'' O

She O
was O
always O
doing O
good O
things O
for O
people O
and O
giving O
money O
to O
those O
in O
need O
. O

While O
Peter O
was O
in O
Lydda O
, O
Tabitha O
became O
sick O
and O
died O
. O

They O
washed O
her O
body O
and O
put O
it O
in O
an O
upstairs O
room O
. O

The O
followers O
in O
Joppa O
heard O
that O
Peter O
was O
in O
Lydda O
, O
which O
was O
not O
far O
away O
. O

So O
they O
sent O
two O
men O
, O
who O
begged O
him O
, O
`` O
Hurry O
, O
please O
come O
quickly O
! O
'' O

Peter O
got O
ready O
and O
went O
with O
them O
. O

When O
he O
arrived O
, O
they O
took O
him O
to O
the O
upstairs O
room O
. O

All O
the O
widows O
stood O
around O
him O
. O

They O
were O
crying O
and O
showing O
him O
the O
coats O
and O
other O
clothes O
that O
Tabitha O
had O
made O
during O
her O
time O
with O
them O
. O

Peter O
sent O
all O
the O
people O
out O
of O
the O
room O
. O

He O
knelt O
down O
and O
prayed O
. O

Then O
he O
turned O
to O
Tabitha O
's O
body O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Tabitha O
, O
stand O
up O
! O
'' O

She O
opened O
her O
eyes O
. O

When O
she O
saw O
Peter O
, O
she O
sat O
up O
. O

He O
gave O
her O
his O
hand O
and O
helped O
her O
stand O
up O
. O

Then O
he O
called O
the O
believers O
and O
the O
widows O
into O
the O
room O
. O

He O
showed O
them O
Tabitha O
; O
she O
was O
alive O
! O

People O
everywhere O
in O
Joppa O
learned O
about O
this O
, O
and O
many O
believed O
in O
the O
Lord O
. O

Peter O
stayed O
in O
Joppa O
for O
many O
days O
at O
the O
home O
of O
a O
man O
named O
Simon O
, O
who O
was O
a O
leatherworker O
. O

While O
Apollos O
was O
in O
the O
city O
of O
Corinth O
, O
Paul O
was O
visiting O
some O
places O
on O
his O
way O
to O
Ephesus O
. O

In O
Ephesus O
he O
found O
some O
other O
followers O
of O
the O
Lord O
. O

He O
asked O
them O
, O
`` O
Did O
you O
receive O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
when O
you O
believed O
? O
'' O

These O
followers O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
We O
have O
never O
even O
heard O
of O
a O
Holy O
Spirit O
! O
'' O

Paul O
asked O
them O
, O
`` O
So O
what O
kind O
of O
baptism O
did O
you O
have O
? O
'' O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
It O
was O
the O
baptism O
that O
John O
taught O
. O
'' O

Paul O
said O
, O
`` O
John O
told O
people O
to O
be O
baptized O
to O
show O
they O
wanted O
to O
change O
their O
lives O
. O

He O
told O
people O
to O
believe O
in O
the O
one O
who O
would O
come O
after O
him O
, O
and O
that O
one O
is O
Jesus O
. O
'' O

When O
these O
followers O
heard O
this O
, O
they O
were O
baptized O
in O
the O
name O
of O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
. O

Then O
Paul O
laid O
his O
hands O
on O
them O
, O
and O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
came O
on O
them O
. O

They O
began O
speaking O
different O
languages O
and O
prophesying O
. O

There O
were O
about O
twelve O
men O
in O
this O
group O
. O

Paul O
went O
into O
the O
synagogue O
and O
spoke O
very O
boldly O
. O

He O
continued O
doing O
this O
for O
three O
months O
. O

He O
talked O
with O
the O
Jews O
, O
trying O
to O
persuade O
them O
to O
accept O
what O
he O
was O
telling O
them O
about O
God O
's O
kingdom O
. O

But O
some O
of O
them O
became O
stubborn O
and O
refused O
to O
believe O
. O

In O
front O
of O
everyone O
, O
they O
said O
bad O
things O
about O
the O
Way O
. O

So O
Paul O
left O
these O
Jews O
and O
took O
the O
Lord O
's O
followers O
with O
him O
. O

He O
went O
to O
a O
place O
where O
a O
man O
named O
Tyrannus O
had O
a O
school O
. O

There O
Paul O
talked O
with O
people O
every O
day O
. O

He O
did O
this O
for O
two O
years O
. O

Because O
of O
this O
work O
, O
everyone O
in O
Asia O
, O
Jews O
and O
Greeks O
, O
heard O
the O
word O
of O
the O
Lord O
. O

God O
used O
Paul O
to O
do O
some O
very O
special O
miracles O
. O

Some O
people O
carried O
away O
handkerchiefs O
and O
clothes O
that O
Paul O
had O
used O
and O
put O
them O
on O
those O
who O
were O
sick O
. O

The O
sick O
people O
were O
healed O
, O
and O
evil O
spirits O
left O
them O
. O

Some O
Jews O
also O
were O
traveling O
around O
forcing O
evil O
spirits O
out O
of O
people O
. O

The O
seven O
sons O
of O
Sceva O
, O
one O
of O
the O
leading O
priests O
, O
were O
doing O
this O
. O

These O
Jews O
tried O
to O
use O
the O
name O
of O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
to O
make O
the O
evil O
spirits O
go O
out O
of O
people O
. O

They O
all O
said O
, O
`` O
By O
the O
same O
Jesus O
that O
Paul O
talks O
about O
, O
I O
order O
you O
to O
come O
out O
! O
'' O

But O
one O
time O
an O
evil O
spirit O
said O
to O
these O
Jews O
, O
`` O
I O
know O
Jesus O
, O
and O
I O
know O
about O
Paul O
, O
but O
who O
are O
you O
? O
'' O

Then O
the O
man O
who O
had O
the O
evil O
spirit O
inside O
him O
jumped O
on O
these O
Jews O
. O

He O
was O
much O
stronger O
than O
all O
of O
them O
. O

He O
beat O
them O
up O
and O
tore O
their O
clothes O
off O
. O

They O
all O
ran O
away O
from O
that O
house O
. O

All O
the O
people O
in O
Ephesus O
, O
Jews O
and O
Greeks O
, O
learned O
about O
this O
. O

They O
were O
all O
filled O
with O
fear O
and O
gave O
great O
honor O
to O
the O
Lord O
Jesus O
. O

Many O
of O
the O
believers O
began O
to O
confess O
, O
telling O
about O
all O
the O
evil O
things O
they O
had O
done O
. O

Some O
of O
them O
had O
used O
magic O
. O

These O
believers O
brought O
their O
magic O
books O
and O
burned O
them O
before O
everyone O
. O

These O
books O
were O
worth O
about O
50 O
, O
000 O
silver O
coins O
. O

This O
is O
how O
the O
word O
of O
the O
Lord O
was O
spreading O
in O
a O
powerful O
way O
, O
causing O
more O
and O
more O
people O
to O
believe O
. O

After O
this O
, O
Paul O
made O
plans O
to O
go O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

He O
planned O
to O
go O
through O
the O
regions O
of O
Macedonia O
and O
Achaia O
, O
and O
then O
go O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

He O
thought O
, O
`` O
After O
I O
visit O
Jerusalem O
, O
I O
must O
also O
visit O
Rome O
. O
'' O

Timothy O
and O
Erastus O
were O
two O
of O
his O
helpers O
. O

Paul O
sent O
them O
ahead O
to O
Macedonia O
. O

But O
he O
stayed O
in O
Asia O
for O
a O
while O
. O

But O
during O
that O
time O
there O
was O
some O
trouble O
in O
Ephesus O
about O
the O
Way O
. O

This O
is O
how O
it O
all O
happened O
: O
There O
was O
a O
man O
named O
Demetrius O
. O

He O
worked O
with O
silver O
. O

He O
made O
little O
silver O
models O
that O
looked O
like O
the O
temple O
of O
the O
goddess O
Artemis O
. O

The O
men O
who O
did O
this O
work O
made O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
. O

Demetrius O
had O
a O
meeting O
with O
these O
men O
and O
some O
others O
who O
did O
the O
same O
kind O
of O
work O
. O

He O
told O
them O
, O
`` O
Men O
, O
you O
know O
that O
we O
make O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
from O
our O
business O
. O

But O
look O
at O
what O
this O
man O
Paul O
is O
doing O
. O

Listen O
to O
what O
he O
is O
saying O
. O

He O
has O
convinced O
many O
people O
in O
Ephesus O
and O
all O
over O
Asia O
to O
change O
their O
religion O
. O

He O
says O
the O
gods O
that O
people O
make O
by O
hand O
are O
not O
real O
. O

I O
'm O
afraid O
this O
is O
going O
to O
turn O
people O
against O
our O
business O
. O

But O
there O
is O
also O
another O
problem O
. O

People O
will O
begin O
to O
think O
that O
the O
temple O
of O
the O
great O
goddess O
Artemis O
is O
not O
important O
. O

Her O
greatness O
will O
be O
destroyed O
. O

And O
Artemis O
is O
the O
goddess O
that O
everyone O
in O
Asia O
and O
the O
whole O
world O
worships O
. O
'' O

When O
the O
men O
heard O
this O
, O
they O
became O
very O
angry O
. O

They O
shouted O
, O
`` O
Great O
is O
Artemis O
, O
the O
goddess O
of O
Ephesus O
! O
'' O

The O
whole O
city O
was O
thrown O
into O
confusion O
. O

The O
people O
grabbed O
Gaius O
and O
Aristarchus O
, O
men O
from O
Macedonia O
who O
were O
traveling O
with O
Paul O
, O
and O
rushed O
all O
together O
into O
the O
stadium O
. O

Paul O
wanted O
to O
go O
in O
and O
talk O
to O
the O
people O
, O
but O
the O
Lord O
's O
followers O
did O
not O
let O
him O
go O
. O

Also O
, O
some O
leaders O
of O
the O
country O
who O
were O
friends O
of O
Paul O
sent O
him O
a O
message O
telling O
him O
not O
to O
go O
into O
the O
stadium O
. O

Some O
people O
were O
shouting O
one O
thing O
and O
others O
were O
shouting O
something O
else O
. O

The O
meeting O
was O
very O
confused O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
people O
did O
not O
know O
why O
they O
had O
come O
there O
. O

Some O
Jews O
made O
a O
man O
named O
Alexander O
stand O
before O
the O
crowd O
, O
and O
they O
told O
him O
what O
to O
say O
. O

Alexander O
waved O
his O
hand O
, O
trying O
to O
explain O
things O
to O
the O
people O
. O

But O
when O
the O
people O
saw O
that O
Alexander O
was O
a O
Jew O
, O
they O
all O
began O
shouting O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

For O
two O
hours O
they O
continued O
shouting O
, O
`` O
Great O
is O
Artemis O
of O
Ephesus O
! O

Great O
is O
Artemis O
of O
Ephesus O
! O

Great O
is O
Artemis O
. O
. O
. O
! O
'' O

Then O
the O
city O
clerk O
persuaded O
the O
people O
to O
be O
quiet O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Men O
of O
Ephesus O
, O
everyone O
knows O
that O
Ephesus O
is O
the O
city O
that O
keeps O
the O
temple O
of O
the O
great O
goddess O
Artemis O
. O

Everyone O
knows O
that O
we O
also O
keep O
her O
holy O
rock O
. O

No O
one O
can O
deny O
this O
, O
so O
you O
should O
be O
quiet O
. O

You O
must O
stop O
and O
think O
before O
you O
do O
anything O
else O
. O

`` O
You O
brought O
these O
men O
here O
, O
but O
they O
have O
not O
said O
anything O
bad O
against O
our O
goddess O
. O

They O
have O
not O
stolen O
anything O
from O
her O
temple O
. O

We O
have O
courts O
of O
law O
and O
there O
are O
judges O
. O

Do O
Demetrius O
and O
those O
men O
who O
work O
with O
him O
have O
a O
charge O
against O
anyone O
? O

They O
should O
go O
to O
the O
courts O
. O

Let O
them O
argue O
with O
each O
other O
there O
. O

`` O
Is O
there O
something O
else O
you O
want O
to O
talk O
about O
? O

Then O
come O
to O
the O
regular O
town O
meeting O
of O
the O
people O
. O

It O
can O
be O
decided O
there O
. O

I O
say O
this O
because O
someone O
might O
see O
this O
trouble O
today O
and O
say O
we O
are O
rioting O
. O

We O
could O
not O
explain O
all O
this O
trouble O
, O
because O
there O
is O
no O
real O
reason O
for O
this O
meeting O
. O
'' O

After O
the O
city O
clerk O
said O
this O
, O
he O
told O
the O
people O
to O
go O
home O
. O

Jesus O
was O
going O
through O
the O
city O
of O
Jericho O
. O

In O
Jericho O
there O
was O
a O
man O
named O
Zacchaeus O
. O

He O
was O
a O
wealthy O
, O
very O
important O
tax O
collector O
. O

He O
wanted O
to O
see O
who O
Jesus O
was O
. O

There O
were O
many O
others O
who O
wanted O
to O
see O
Jesus O
too O
. O

Zacchaeus O
was O
too O
short O
to O
see O
above O
the O
people O
. O

So O
he O
ran O
to O
a O
place O
where O
he O
knew O
Jesus O
would O
come O
. O

Then O
he O
climbed O
a O
sycamore O
tree O
so O
he O
could O
see O
him O
. O

When O
Jesus O
came O
to O
where O
Zacchaeus O
was O
, O
he O
looked O
up O
and O
saw O
him O
in O
the O
tree O
. O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Zacchaeus O
, O
hurry O
! O

Come O
down O
! O

I O
must O
stay O
at O
your O
house O
today O
. O
'' O

Zacchaeus O
hurried O
and O
came O
down O
. O

He O
was O
happy O
to O
have O
Jesus O
in O
his O
house O
. O

Everyone O
saw O
this O
. O

They O
began O
to O
complain O
, O
`` O
Look O
at O
the O
kind O
of O
man O
Jesus O
is O
staying O
with O
. O

Zacchaeus O
is O
a O
sinner O
! O
'' O

Zacchaeus O
said O
to O
the O
Lord O
, O
`` O
I O
want O
to O
do O
good O
. O

I O
will O
give O
half O
of O
my O
money O
to O
the O
poor O
. O

If O
I O
have O
cheated O
anyone O
, O
I O
will O
pay O
them O
back O
four O
times O
more O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Today O
is O
the O
day O
for O
this O
family O
to O
be O
saved O
from O
sin O
. O

Yes O
, O
even O
this O
tax O
collector O
is O
one O
of O
God O
's O
chosen O
people O
. O

The O
Son O
of O
Man O
came O
to O
find O
lost O
people O
and O
save O
them O
. O
'' O

As O
the O
crowd O
listened O
to O
what O
he O
was O
saying O
, O
Jesus O
went O
on O
to O
tell O
a O
story O
. O

He O
was O
now O
near O
Jerusalem O
and O
knew O
that O
the O
people O
thought O
it O
was O
almost O
time O
for O
God O
's O
kingdom O
to O
come O
. O

So O
he O
said O
, O
`` O
A O
very O
important O
man O
was O
preparing O
to O
go O
to O
a O
country O
far O
away O
to O
be O
made O
a O
king O
. O

Then O
he O
planned O
to O
return O
home O
and O
rule O
his O
people O
. O

So O
he O
called O
ten O
of O
his O
servants O
together O
. O

He O
gave O
a O
bag O
of O
money O
to O
each O
servant O
. O

He O
said O
, O
' O
Do O
business O
with O
this O
money O
until O
I O
come O
back O
. O
' O

But O
the O
people O
in O
the O
kingdom O
hated O
the O
man O
. O

They O
sent O
a O
group O
to O
follow O
him O
to O
the O
other O
country O
. O

There O
they O
said O
, O
' O
We O
do O
n't O

the O
man O

When O
he O
came O
home O

he O
said O

Call O
those O
servants O

my O
money O

I O
want O
to O
know O
how O
much O
more O

they O
earned O
with O
it O

The O
first O
servant O
came O
and O
said O
, O
' O
Sir O
, O
I O
earned O
ten O
bags O
of O
money O
with O
the O
one O
bag O
you O
gave O
me O

The O
king O
said O
to O
him O
, O
' O
That O
's O
great O
! O

You O
are O
a O
good O
servant O

I O
see O
that O
I O
can O
trust O
you O
with O
small O
things O

So O
now O
I O
will O
let O
you O
rule O
over O
ten O

`` O
The O
second O

with O
your O
one O

five O

The O
king O
said O
to O
this O
servant O
, O
' O
You O
can O
rule O
over O
five O
cities O

`` O
Then O
another O
servant O
came O
in O
and O
said O
to O
the O
king O
, O
' O
Sir O
, O
here O
is O
your O
bag O
of O
money O

I O
wrapped O
it O
in O
a O
piece O
of O
cloth O
and O
hid O
it O
. O

I O
was O
afraid O
of O
you O
because O
you O
are O
a O
hard O
man O
. O

You O
even O
take O
money O
that O
you O
did O
n't O
earn O
and O
gather O
food O
that O
you O
did O
n't O
grow O

`` O
Then O
the O
king O
said O
to O
him O
, O
' O
What O
a O
bad O
servant O
you O
are O
! O

I O
will O
use O
your O
own O
words O

You O
said O
that O
I O
am O
a O

You O
said O
that O
I O

money O
that O
I O

gather O
food O
that O
I O
did O

If O
that O
is O
true O
, O
you O
should O
have O
put O
my O
money O
in O
the O
bank O
. O

Then O
, O
when O
I O
came O
back O
, O
my O
money O
would O
have O
earned O
some O
interest O

' O

Then O
the O
king O
said O
to O
the O
men O
who O
were O
watching O
, O
' O
Take O
the O
bag O
of O
money O
away O
from O
this O
servant O
and O
give O
it O
to O
the O
servant O
who O
earned O
ten O
bags O
of O
money O

' O

`` O
The O
men O
said O
to O
the O
king O

that O
servant O
already O

ten O

those O

Now O
where O

Where O
are O
the O
people O
who O
did O
not O

Bring O
my O
enemies O
here O

kill O

I O
will O
watch O

' O
'' O

After O
Jesus O
said O
these O
things O
, O
he O
continued O
traveling O
toward O
Jerusalem O
. O

He O
came O
near O
Bethphage O
and O
Bethany O
, O
towns O
near O
the O
hill O
called O
the O
Mount O
of O
Olives O
. O

He O
sent O
out O
two O
of O
his O
followers O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Go O
into O
the O
town O
you O
can O
see O
there O
. O

When O
you O
enter O
the O
town O
, O
you O
will O
find O
a O
young O
donkey O
tied O
there O
that O
no O
one O
has O
ever O
ridden O
. O

Untie O
it O
, O
and O
bring O
it O
here O
to O
me O
. O

If O
anyone O
asks O
you O
why O
you O
are O
taking O
the O
donkey O
, O
you O
should O
say O
, O
' O
The O
Master O
needs O
it O
. O
' O
'' O

The O
two O
followers O
went O
into O
town O
. O

They O
found O
the O
donkey O
exactly O
like O
Jesus O
told O
them O
. O

They O
untied O
it O
, O
but O
its O
owners O
came O
out O
. O

They O
said O
to O
the O
followers O
, O
`` O
Why O
are O
you O
untying O
our O
donkey O
? O
'' O

The O
followers O
answered O
, O
`` O
The O
Master O
needs O
it O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
followers O
brought O
the O
donkey O
to O
Jesus O
. O

They O
put O
their O
coats O
on O
its O
back O
. O

Then O
they O
put O
Jesus O
on O
the O
donkey O
. O

He O
rode O
along O
the O
road O
toward O
Jerusalem O
. O

The O
followers O
spread O
their O
coats O
on O
the O
road O
before O
him O
. O

Jesus O
was O
coming O
close O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

He O
was O
already O
near O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
Mount O
of O
Olives O
. O

The O
whole O
group O
of O
followers O
was O
happy O
. O

They O
were O
very O
excited O
and O
praised O
God O
. O

They O
thanked O
God O
for O
all O
the O
powerful O
things O
they O
had O
seen O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
' O
Welcome O
! O

God O
bless O
the O
king O
who O
comes O
in O
the O
name O
of O
the O
Lord O
. O
' O

Peace O
in O
heaven O
and O
glory O
to O
God O
! O
'' O

Some O
of O
the O
Pharisees O
said O
to O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
Teacher O
, O
tell O
your O
followers O
not O
to O
say O
these O
things O
. O
'' O

But O
Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
tell O
you O
, O
if O
my O
followers O
did O
n't O
say O
them O
, O
these O
stones O
would O
shout O
them O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
came O
near O
Jerusalem O
. O

Looking O
at O
the O
city O
, O
he O
began O
to O
cry O
for O
it O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
wish O
you O
knew O
today O
what O
would O
bring O
you O
peace O
. O

But O
it O
is O
hidden O
from O
you O
now O
. O

A O
time O
is O
coming O
when O
your O
enemies O
will O
build O
a O
wall O
around O
you O
and O
hold O
you O
in O
on O
all O
sides O
. O

They O
will O
destroy O
you O
and O
all O
your O
people O
. O

Not O
one O
stone O
of O
your O
buildings O
will O
stay O
on O
top O
of O
another O
. O

All O
this O
will O
happen O
because O
you O
did O
not O
know O
the O
time O
when O
God O
came O
to O
save O
you O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
went O
into O
the O
Temple O
area O
. O

He O
began O
to O
throw O
out O
the O
people O
who O
were O
selling O
things O
there O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
' O
My O
Temple O
will O
be O
a O
house O
of O
prayer O
. O
' O

But O
you O
have O
changed O
it O
into O
a O
' O
hiding O
place O
for O
thieves O
. O
' O
'' O

Jesus O
taught O
the O
people O
in O
the O
Temple O
area O
every O
day O
. O

The O
leading O
priests O
, O
the O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
, O
and O
some O
of O
the O
leaders O
of O
the O
people O
wanted O
to O
kill O
him O
. O

But O
they O
did O
not O
know O
how O
they O
could O
do O
it O
, O
because O
everyone O
was O
listening O
to O
him O
. O

The O
people O
were O
very O
interested O
in O
what O
Jesus O
said O
. O

Jesus O
called O
his O
twelve O
apostles O
together O
. O

He O
gave O
them O
power O
to O
heal O
sicknesses O
and O
power O
to O
force O
demons O
out O
of O
people O
. O

He O
sent O
them O
to O
tell O
about O
God O
's O
kingdom O
and O
to O
heal O
the O
sick O
. O

He O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
When O
you O
travel O
, O
do O
n't O
take O
a O
walking O
stick O
. O

Also O
, O
do O
n't O
carry O
a O
bag O
, O
food O
, O
or O
money O
. O

Take O
for O
your O
trip O
only O
the O
clothes O
you O
are O
wearing O
. O

When O
you O
go O
into O
a O
house O
, O
stay O
there O
until O
it O
is O
time O
to O
leave O
. O

If O
the O
people O
in O
the O
town O
will O
not O
welcome O
you O
, O
go O
outside O
the O
town O
and O
shake O
the O
dust O
off O
your O
feet O
as O
a O
warning O
to O
them O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
apostles O
went O
out O
. O

They O
traveled O
through O
all O
the O
towns O
. O

They O
told O
the O
Good O
News O
and O
healed O
people O
everywhere O
. O

Herod O
the O
ruler O
heard O
about O
all O
these O
things O
that O
were O
happening O
. O

He O
was O
confused O
because O
some O
people O
said O
, O
`` O
John O
the O
Baptizer O
has O
risen O
from O
death O
. O
'' O

Others O
said O
, O
`` O
Elijah O
has O
come O
to O
us O
. O
'' O

And O
some O
others O
said O
, O
`` O
One O
of O
the O
prophets O
from O
long O
ago O
has O
risen O
from O
death O
. O
'' O

Herod O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
cut O
off O
John O
's O
head O
. O

So O
who O
is O
this O
man O
I O
hear O
these O
things O
about O
? O
'' O

Herod O
continued O
trying O
to O
see O
Jesus O
. O

When O
the O
apostles O
came O
back O
, O
they O
told O
Jesus O
what O
they O
had O
done O
on O
their O
trip O
. O

Then O
he O
took O
them O
away O
to O
a O
town O
called O
Bethsaida O
. O

There O
, O
he O
and O
his O
apostles O
could O
be O
alone O
together O
. O

But O
the O
people O
learned O
where O
Jesus O
went O
and O
followed O
him O
. O

He O
welcomed O
them O
and O
talked O
with O
them O
about O
God O
's O
kingdom O
. O

He O
healed O
the O
people O
who O
were O
sick O
. O

Late O
in O
the O
afternoon O
, O
the O
twelve O
apostles O
came O
to O
Jesus O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
No O
one O
lives O
in O
this O
place O
. O

Send O
the O
people O
away O
. O

They O
need O
to O
find O
food O
and O
places O
to O
sleep O
in O
the O
farms O
and O
towns O
around O
here O
. O
'' O

But O
Jesus O
said O
to O
the O
apostles O
, O
`` O
You O
give O
them O
something O
to O
eat O
. O
'' O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
We O
have O
only O
five O
loaves O
of O
bread O
and O
two O
fish O
. O

Do O
you O
want O
us O
to O
go O
buy O
food O
for O
all O
these O
people O
? O
'' O

There O
are O
too O
many O
! O

-LRB- O
There O
were O
about O
5000 O
men O
there O
. O
-RRB- O

Jesus O
said O
to O
his O
followers O
, O
`` O
Tell O
the O
people O
to O
sit O
in O
groups O
of O
about O
50 O
people O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
followers O
did O
this O
and O
everyone O
sat O
down O
. O

Then O
Jesus O
took O
the O
five O
loaves O
of O
bread O
and O
two O
fish O
. O

He O
looked O
up O
into O
the O
sky O
and O
thanked O
God O
for O
the O
food O
. O

Then O
he O
broke O
it O
into O
pieces O
, O
which O
he O
gave O
to O
the O
followers O
to O
give O
to O
the O
people O
. O

They O
all O
ate O
until O
they O
were O
full O
. O

And O
there O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
food O
left O
. O

Twelve O
baskets O
were O
filled O
with O
the O
pieces O
of O
food O
that O
were O
not O
eaten O
. O

One O
time O
Jesus O
was O
praying O
alone O
. O

His O
followers O
came O
together O
there O
, O
and O
he O
asked O
them O
, O
`` O
Who O
do O
the O
people O
say O
I O
am O

They O
answered O
, O
`` O
Some O
people O
say O
you O
are O
John O
the O
Baptizer O

Others O
say O
you O
are O

And O
some O
people O
say O
you O
are O
one O
of O
the O
prophets O
from O
long O
ago O
that O
has O
come O
back O
to O
life O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
to O
his O
followers O
, O
`` O
And O
who O
do O
you O
say O
I O
am O
? O
'' O

Peter O
answered O
, O
`` O
You O
are O
the O
Christ O
from O
God O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
warned O
them O
not O
to O
tell O
anyone O
. O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
Son O
of O
Man O
must O
suffer O
many O
things O

He O
will O
be O
rejected O
by O

Jewish O
leaders O

the O
leading O
priests O

And O
he O
will O
be O
killed O
. O

But O
after O
three O
days O
he O
will O
be O
raised O
from O
death O

Jesus O
continued O
to O
say O
to O
all O
of O
them O
, O
`` O
Any O

you O

up O

will O

About O
eight O

after O

said O
these O

he O
took O
Peter O

John O

went O
up O
on O
a O
mountain O
to O
pray O

While O
Jesus O
was O
praying O

his O
face O
began O
to O
change O

His O
clothes O
became O
shining O

Then O
two O

there O

a O
long O
time O
after O
that O
, O
they O
told O
no O
one O
about O
what O
they O
had O
seen O
. O

The O
next O
day O
, O
Jesus O
, O
Peter O
, O
John O
, O
and O
James O
came O
down O
from O
the O
mountain O
. O

A O
large O
group O
of O
people O
met O
Jesus O
. O

A O
man O
in O
the O
group O
shouted O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Teacher O
, O
please O
come O
and O
look O
at O
my O
son O
. O

He O
is O
the O
only O
child O
I O
have O
. O

An O
evil O
spirit O
comes O
into O
him O
, O
and O
then O
he O
shouts O
. O

He O
loses O
control O
of O
himself O
and O
foams O
at O
the O
mouth O
. O

The O
evil O
spirit O
continues O
to O
hurt O
him O
and O
almost O
never O
leaves O
him O
. O

I O
begged O
your O
followers O
to O
make O
the O
evil O
spirit O
leave O
my O
son O
, O
but O
they O
could O
not O
do O
it O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
You O
people O
today O
have O
no O
faith O
. O

Your O
lives O
are O
all O
wrong O
. O

How O
long O
must O
I O
be O
with O
you O
and O
be O
patient O
with O
you O
? O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
to O
the O
man O
, O
`` O
Bring O
your O
son O
here O
. O
'' O

While O
the O
boy O
was O
coming O
, O
the O
demon O
threw O
the O
boy O
to O
the O
ground O
. O

The O
boy O
lost O
control O
of O
himself O
. O

But O
Jesus O
gave O
a O
strong O
command O
to O
the O
evil O
spirit O
. O

Then O
the O
boy O
was O
healed O
, O
and O
Jesus O
gave O
him O
back O
to O
his O
father O
. O

All O
the O
people O
were O
amazed O
at O
the O
great O
power O
of O
God O
. O

The O
people O
were O
still O
amazed O
about O
all O
the O
things O
Jesus O
did O
. O

He O
said O
to O
his O
followers O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
forget O
what O
I O
will O
tell O
you O
now O
: O
The O
Son O
of O
Man O
will O
soon O
be O
handed O
over O
to O
the O
control O
of O
other O
men O
. O
'' O

But O
the O
followers O
did O
not O
understand O
what O
he O
meant O
. O

The O
meaning O
was O
hidden O
from O
them O
so O
that O
they O
could O
not O
understand O
it O
. O

But O
they O
were O
afraid O
to O
ask O
Jesus O
about O
what O
he O
said O
. O

Jesus O
' O
followers O
began O
to O
have O
an O
argument O
about O
which O
one O
of O
them O
was O
the O
greatest O
. O

Jesus O
knew O
what O
they O
were O
thinking O
, O
so O
he O
took O
a O
little O
child O
and O
stood O
the O
child O
beside O
him O
. O

Then O
he O
said O
to O
the O
followers O
, O
`` O
Whoever O
accepts O
a O
little O
child O
like O
this O
in O
my O
name O
is O
accepting O
me O
. O

And O
anyone O
who O
accepts O
me O
is O
also O
accepting O
the O
one O
who O
sent O
me O
. O

The O
one O
among O
you O
who O
is O
the O
most O
humble O
-- O
this O
is O
the O
one O
who O
is O
great O
. O
'' O

John O
answered O
, O
`` O
Master O
, O
we O
saw O
someone O
using O
your O
name O
to O
force O
demons O
out O
of O
people O
. O

We O
told O
him O
to O
stop O
because O
he O
does O
not O
belong O
to O
our O
group O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
stop O
him O
. O

Whoever O
is O
not O
against O
you O
is O
for O
you O
. O
'' O

The O
time O
was O
coming O
near O
when O
Jesus O
would O
leave O
and O
go O
back O
to O
heaven O
. O

He O
decided O
to O
go O
to O
Jerusalem O
. O

He O
sent O
some O
men O
ahead O
of O
him O
. O

They O
went O
into O
a O
town O
in O
Samaria O
to O
make O
everything O
ready O
for O
him O
. O

But O
the O
people O
there O
would O
not O
welcome O
Jesus O
because O
he O
was O
going O
toward O
Jerusalem O
. O

James O
and O
John O
, O
the O
followers O
of O
Jesus O
, O
saw O
this O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
do O
you O
want O
us O
to O
call O
fire O
down O
from O
heaven O
and O
destroy O
those O
people O
? O
'' O

But O
Jesus O
turned O
and O
criticized O
them O
for O
saying O
this O
. O

Then O
he O
and O
his O
followers O
went O
to O
another O
town O
. O

They O
were O
all O
traveling O
along O
the O
road O
. O

Someone O
said O
to O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
I O
will O
follow O
you O
anywhere O
you O
go O
. O
'' O

He O
answered O
, O
`` O
The O
foxes O
have O
holes O
to O
live O
in O
. O

The O
birds O
have O
nests O
. O

But O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O
has O
no O
place O
where O
he O
can O
rest O
his O
head O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
to O
another O
man O
, O
`` O
Follow O
me O
! O
'' O

But O
the O
man O
said O
, O
`` O
Lord O
, O
let O
me O
go O
and O
bury O
my O
father O
first O
. O
'' O

But O
Jesus O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Let O
the O
people O
who O
are O
dead O
bury O
their O
own O
dead O
. O

You O
must O
go O
and O
tell O
about O
God O
's O
kingdom O
. O
'' O

Another O
man O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
will O
follow O
you O
, O
Lord O
, O
but O
first O
let O
me O
go O
and O
say O
goodbye O
to O
my O
family O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Anyone O
who O
begins O
to O
plow O
a O
field O
but O
looks O
back O
is O
not O
prepared O
for O
God O
's O
kingdom O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Believe O
me O
when O
I O
say O
that O
some O
of O
you O
people O
standing O
here O
will O
see O
God O
's O
kingdom O
come O
with O
power O
before O
you O
die O
. O
'' O

Six O
days O
later O
, O
Jesus O
took O
Peter O
, O
James O
, O
and O
John O
and O
went O
up O
on O
a O
high O
mountain O
. O

They O
were O
all O
alone O
there O
. O

While O
these O
followers O
watched O
him O
, O
Jesus O
was O
changed O
. O

His O
clothes O
became O
shining O
white O
-- O
whiter O
than O
anyone O
on O
earth O
could O
make O
them O
. O

Then O
two O
men O
were O
there O
talking O
with O
Jesus O
. O

They O
were O
Elijah O
and O
Moses O
. O

Peter O
said O
to O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
Teacher O
, O
it O
is O
good O
that O
we O
are O
here O
. O

We O
will O
put O
three O
tents O
here O
-- O
one O
for O
you O
, O
one O
for O
Moses O
, O
and O
one O
for O
Elijah O
. O
'' O

Peter O
did O
not O
know O
what O
to O
say O
, O
because O
he O
and O
the O
other O
two O
followers O
were O
so O
afraid O
. O

Then O
a O
cloud O
came O
and O
covered O
them O
. O

A O
voice O
came O
from O
the O
cloud O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
This O
is O
my O
Son O
, O
the O
one O
I O
love O
. O

Obey O
him O
! O
'' O

The O
followers O
looked O
, O
but O
they O
saw O
only O
Jesus O
there O
alone O
with O
them O
. O

As O
Jesus O
and O
the O
followers O
were O
walking O
back O
down O
the O
mountain O
, O
he O
gave O
them O
these O
instructions O
: O
`` O
Do O
n't O
tell O
anyone O
about O
what O
you O
saw O
on O
the O
mountain O
. O

Wait O
until O
after O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O
rises O
from O
death O
. O

Then O
you O
can O
tell O
people O
what O
you O
saw O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
followers O
waited O
to O
say O
anything O
about O
what O
they O
saw O
. O

But O
they O
discussed O
among O
themselves O
what O
Jesus O
meant O
about O
rising O
from O
death O
. O

They O
asked O
him O
, O
`` O
Why O
do O
the O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
say O
that O
Elijah O
must O
come O
first O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
They O
are O
right O
to O
say O
that O
Elijah O
must O
come O
first O
. O

Elijah O
makes O
all O
things O
the O
way O
they O
should O
be O
. O

But O
why O
do O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
that O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O
will O
suffer O
much O
and O
that O
people O
will O
think O
he O
is O
worth O
nothing O
? O

I O
tell O
you O
that O
Elijah O
has O
already O
come O
. O

And O
people O
did O
to O
him O
all O
the O
bad O
things O
they O
wanted O
to O
do O
. O

The O
Scriptures O
said O
this O
would O
happen O
to O
him O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
, O
Peter O
, O
James O
, O
and O
John O
went O
to O
the O
other O
followers O
. O

They O
saw O
many O
people O
around O
them O
. O

The O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
were O
arguing O
with O
the O
followers O
. O

When O
the O
people O
saw O
Jesus O
, O
they O
were O
very O
surprised O
and O
ran O
to O
welcome O
him O
. O

Jesus O
asked O
, O
`` O
What O
are O
you O
arguing O
about O
with O
the O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
? O
'' O

A O
man O
answered O
, O
`` O
Teacher O
, O
I O
brought O
my O
son O
to O
you O
. O

He O
is O
controlled O
by O
an O
evil O
spirit O
that O
keeps O
him O
from O
talking O
. O

The O
spirit O
attacks O
him O
and O
throws O
him O
on O
the O
ground O
. O

He O
foams O
at O
the O
mouth O
, O
grinds O
his O
teeth O
, O
and O
becomes O
very O
stiff O
. O

I O
asked O
your O
followers O
to O
force O
the O
evil O
spirit O
out O
, O
but O
they O
could O
not O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
You O
people O
today O
do O
n't O
believe O
! O

How O
long O
must O
I O
stay O
with O
you O
? O

How O
long O
must O
I O
be O
patient O
with O
you O
? O

Bring O
the O
boy O
to O
me O
! O
'' O

So O
the O
followers O
brought O
the O
boy O
to O
Jesus O
. O

When O
the O
evil O
spirit O
saw O
Jesus O
, O
it O
attacked O
the O
boy O
. O

The O
boy O
fell O
down O
and O
rolled O
on O
the O
ground O
. O

He O
was O
foaming O
at O
the O
mouth O
. O

Jesus O
asked O
the O
boy O
's O
father O
, O
`` O
How O
long O
has O
this O
been O
happening O
to O
him O
? O
'' O

The O
father O
answered O
, O
`` O
Since O
he O
was O
very O
young O
. O

The O
spirit O
often O
throws O
him O
into O
a O
fire O
or O
into O
water O
to O
kill O
him O
. O

If O
you O
can O
do O
anything O
, O
please O
have O
pity O
on O
us O
and O
help O
us O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
to O
the O
father O
, O
`` O
Why O
did O
you O
say O
' O
if O
you O
can O
' O
? O

All O
things O
are O
possible O
for O
the O
one O
who O
believes O
. O
'' O

Immediately O
the O
father O
shouted O
, O
`` O
I O
do O
believe O
. O

Help O
me O
to O
believe O
more O
! O
'' O

Jesus O
saw O
that O
all O
the O
people O
were O
running O
there O
to O
see O
what O
was O
happening O
. O

So O
he O
spoke O
to O
the O
evil O
spirit O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
evil O
spirit O
that O
makes O
this O
boy O
deaf O
and O
stops O
him O
from O
talking O
-- O
I O
command O
you O
to O
come O
out O
of O
him O
and O
never O
enter O
him O
again O
! O
'' O

The O
evil O
spirit O
screamed O
. O

It O
caused O
the O
boy O
to O
fall O
on O
the O
ground O
again O
, O
and O
then O
it O
came O
out O
. O

The O
boy O
looked O
as O
if O
he O
was O
dead O
. O

Many O
people O
said O
, O
`` O
He O
is O
dead O
! O
'' O

But O
Jesus O
took O
hold O
of O
his O
hand O
and O
helped O
him O
stand O
up O
. O

Then O
Jesus O
went O
into O
the O
house O
. O

His O
followers O
were O
alone O
with O
him O
there O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Why O
were O
n't O
we O
able O
to O
force O
that O
evil O
spirit O
out O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
That O
kind O
of O
spirit O
can O
be O
forced O
out O
only O
with O
prayer O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
and O
his O
followers O
left O
there O
and O
went O
through O
Galilee O
. O

Jesus O
did O
not O
want O
the O
people O
to O
know O
where O
they O
were O
. O

He O
wanted O
to O
teach O
his O
followers O
alone O
. O

He O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
The O
Son O
of O
Man O
will O
be O
handed O
over O
to O
the O
control O
of O
other O
men O
, O
who O
will O
kill O
him O
. O

After O
three O
days O
, O
he O
will O
rise O
from O
death O
. O
'' O

But O
the O
followers O
did O
not O
understand O
what O
he O
meant O
, O
and O
they O
were O
afraid O
to O
ask O
him O
. O

Jesus O
and O
his O
followers O
went O
to O
Capernaum O
. O

They O
went O
into O
a O
house O
, O
and O
Jesus O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
I O
heard O
you O
arguing O
on O
the O
way O
here O
today O
. O

What O
were O
you O
arguing O
about O
? O
'' O

But O
the O
followers O
did O
not O
answer O
, O
because O
their O
argument O
on O
the O
road O
was O
about O
which O
one O
of O
them O
was O
the O
greatest O
. O

Jesus O
sat O
down O
and O
called O
the O
twelve O
apostles O
to O
him O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Whoever O
wants O
to O
be O
the O
most O
important O
must O
make O
others O
more O
important O
than O
themselves O
. O

They O
must O
serve O
everyone O
else O
. O
'' O

Then O
Jesus O
took O
a O
small O
child O
and O
stood O
the O
child O
in O
front O
of O
the O
followers O
. O

He O
held O
the O
child O
in O
his O
arms O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Whoever O
accepts O
children O
like O
these O
in O
my O
name O
is O
accepting O
me O
. O

And O
anyone O
who O
accepts O
me O
is O
also O
accepting O
the O
one O
who O
sent O
me O
. O
'' O

Then O
John O
said O
, O
`` O
Teacher O
, O
we O
saw O
a O
man O
using O
your O
name O
to O
force O
demons O
out O
of O
someone O

He O
is O
not O
one O
of O
us O

So O
we O
told O
him O
to O
stop O
, O
because O
he O
does O
not O
belong O
to O
our O
group O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O

him O

Whoever O
uses O
my O
name O
to O
do O
powerful O
things O

not O
soon O
say O
bad O
things O
about O

Whoever O

I O
can O

you O
by O
giving O
you O
a O
drink O
of O
water O
because O
you O

Christ O

definitely O
get O
a O
reward O

`` O
If O
one O

little O
children O

in O
me O

and O
someone O
causes O
that O
child O

sin O
, O
it O
will O
be O
very O
bad O
for O
that O
person O

It O
would O
be O
better O
for O
them O
to O
have O
a O
millstone O
tied O
around O

be O
drowned O
in O
the O
sea O

If O

you O
to O
lose O
part O
of O
your O
body O
and O
have O
eternal O
life O
than O
to O
have O
two O
feet O
and O
be O
thrown O
into O
hell O
. O

If O
your O
eye O
makes O
you O
sin O
, O
take O
it O
out O
. O

It O
is O
better O
for O
you O
to O
have O
only O
one O
eye O
and O
enter O
God O
's O
kingdom O
than O
to O
have O
two O
eyes O

be O
thrown O
into O
hell O

The O
worms O
that O
eat O
the O
people O

The O
fire O
there O
is O
never O

`` O
Everyone O

be O
salted O

fire O

`` O
Salt O
is O
good O

But O
if O
it O
loses O
its O
salty O
taste O
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
make O
it O
good O
again O

So O
, O
do O
n't O
lose O
that O
good O
quality O
of O
salt O
you O
have O
. O

And O
live O
in O
peace O
with O
each O

'' O

After O
Jesus O
said O
all O
these O
things O
, O
he O
left O
Galilee O
. O

He O
went O
into O
the O
area O
of O
Judea O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
Jordan O
River O
. O

Many O
people O
followed O
him O
. O

Jesus O
healed O
the O
sick O
people O
there O
. O

Some O
Pharisees O
came O
to O
Jesus O
. O

They O
tried O
to O
make O
him O
say O
something O
wrong O
. O

They O
asked O
him O
, O
`` O
Is O
it O
right O
for O
a O
man O
to O
divorce O
his O
wife O
for O
any O
reason O
he O
chooses O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
Surely O
you O
have O
read O
this O
in O
the O
Scriptures O
: O
When O
God O
made O
the O
world O
, O
' O
he O
made O
people O
male O
and O
female O
. O
' O

And O
God O
said O
, O
' O
That O
is O
why O
a O
man O
will O
leave O
his O
father O
and O
mother O
and O
be O
joined O
to O
his O
wife O
. O

And O
the O
two O
people O
will O
become O
one O
. O
' O

So O
they O
are O
no O
longer O
two O
, O
but O
one O
. O

God O
has O
joined O
them O
together O
, O
so O
no O
one O
should O
separate O
them O
. O
'' O

The O
Pharisees O
asked O
, O
`` O
Then O
why O
did O
Moses O
give O
a O
command O
allowing O
a O
man O
to O
divorce O
his O
wife O
by O
writing O
a O
certificate O
of O
divorce O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
Moses O
allowed O
you O
to O
divorce O
your O
wives O
because O
you O
refused O
to O
accept O
God O
's O
teaching O
. O

But O
divorce O
was O
not O
allowed O
in O
the O
beginning O
. O

I O
tell O
you O
that O
whoever O
divorces O
his O
wife O
, O
except O
for O
the O
problem O
of O
sexual O
sin O
, O
and O
marries O
another O
woman O
is O
guilty O
of O
adultery O
. O
'' O

The O
followers O
said O
to O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
If O
that O
is O
the O
only O
reason O
a O
man O
can O
divorce O
his O
wife O
, O
it O
is O
better O
not O
to O
marry O
. O
'' O

He O
answered O
, O
`` O
This O
statement O
is O
true O
for O
some O
, O
but O
not O
for O
everyone O
-- O
only O
for O
those O
who O
have O
been O
given O
this O
gift O
. O

There O
are O
different O
reasons O
why O
some O
men O
do O
n't O
marry O
. O

Some O
were O
born O
without O
the O
ability O
to O
produce O
children O
. O

Others O
were O
made O
that O
way O
later O
in O
life O
. O

And O
others O
have O
given O
up O
marriage O
because O
of O
God O
's O
kingdom O
. O

This O
is O
for O
anyone O
who O
is O
able O
to O
accept O
it O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
people O
brought O
their O
little O
children O
to O
Jesus O
so O
that O
he O
could O
lay O
his O
hands O
on O
them O
to O
bless O
them O
and O
pray O
for O
them O
. O

When O
the O
followers O
saw O
this O
, O
they O
told O
the O
people O
to O
stop O
bringing O
their O
children O
to O
him O
. O

But O
Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Let O
the O
little O
children O
come O
to O
me O
. O

Do O
n't O
stop O
them O
, O
because O
God O
's O
kingdom O
belongs O
to O
people O
who O
are O
like O
these O
children O
. O
'' O

After O
Jesus O
blessed O
the O
children O
, O
he O
left O
there O
. O

A O
man O
came O
to O
Jesus O
and O
asked O
, O
`` O
Teacher O
, O
what O
good O
thing O
must O
I O
do O
to O
have O
eternal O
life O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
Why O
do O
you O
ask O
me O
about O
what O
is O
good O
? O

Only O
God O
is O
good O
. O

But O
if O
you O
want O
to O
have O
eternal O
life O
, O
obey O
the O
law O
's O
commands O
. O
'' O

The O
man O
asked O
, O
`` O
Which O
ones O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
' O
You O
must O
not O
murder O
anyone O
, O
you O
must O
not O
commit O
adultery O
, O
you O
must O
not O
steal O
, O
you O
must O
not O
tell O
lies O
about O
others O
, O
you O
must O
respect O
your O
father O

mother O
, O
' O
and O
' O
love O
your O
neighbor O
the O
same O
as O
you O
love O
yourself O
. O
' O
'' O

The O
young O
man O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
have O
obeyed O
all O
these O
commands O
. O

What O
else O
do O
I O
need O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
If O
you O
want O
to O
be O
perfect O
, O
then O
go O
and O
sell O
all O
that O
you O
own O

Give O
the O
money O
to O
the O
poor O
, O
and O
you O
will O
have O
riches O
in O
heaven O
. O

Then O
come O
and O
follow O
me O
! O
'' O

But O
when O
the O
young O
man O
heard O
Jesus O
tell O
him O
to O
give O
away O
his O
money O
, O
he O
was O
sad O
. O

He O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
do O
this O
, O
because O
he O
was O
very O
rich O
. O

So O
he O
left O
. O

Then O
Jesus O
said O
to O
his O
followers O
, O
`` O
The O
truth O
is O
, O
it O
will O
be O
very O
hard O
for O
a O
rich O
person O
to O
enter O
God O
's O
kingdom O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
tell O
you O
, O
it O
is O
easier O
for O
a O
camel O
to O
go O
through O
the O
eye O
of O
a O
needle O
than O
for O
a O
rich O
person O
to O
enter O
God O
's O
kingdom O
. O
'' O

The O
followers O
were O
amazed O
to O
hear O
this O
. O

They O
asked O
, O
`` O
Then O
who O
can O
be O
saved O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
looked O
at O
them O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
This O
is O
something O
that O
people O
can O
not O
do O
. O

But O
God O
can O
do O
anything O
. O
'' O

Peter O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
We O
left O
everything O
we O
had O
and O
followed O
you O
. O

So O
what O
will O
we O
have O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
When O
the O
time O
of O
the O
new O
world O
comes O
, O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O
will O
sit O
on O
his O
great O
and O
glorious O
throne O
. O

And O
I O
can O
promise O
that O
you O
who O
followed O
me O
will O
sit O
on O
twelve O
thrones O
, O
and O
you O
will O
judge O
the O
twelve O
tribes O
of O
Israel O
. O

Everyone O
who O
has O
left O
houses O
, O
brothers O
, O
sisters O
, O
father O
, O
mother O
, O
children O
, O
or O
farms O
to O
follow O
me O
will O
get O
much O
more O
than O
they O
left O

And O
they O
will O
have O
eternal O
life O
. O

Many O
people O
who O
are O
first O
now O
will O
be O
last O
in O
the O

And O
many O
who O
are O
last O
now O
will O
be O
first O
in O
the O
future O

Jesus O
got O
into O
a O
boat O
and O
went O
back O
across O
the O
lake O
to O
his O
own O
town O
. O

Some O
people O
brought O
to O
him O
a O
man O
who O
was O
paralyzed O
and O
was O
lying O
on O
a O
mat O
. O

Jesus O
saw O
that O
these O
people O
had O
much O
faith O
. O

So O
he O
said O
to O
the O
paralyzed O
man O
, O
`` O
Young O
man O
, O
you O
will O
be O
glad O
to O
hear O
this O
. O

Your O
sins O
are O
forgiven O
. O
'' O

Some O
of O
the O
teachers O
of O
the O
law O
heard O
what O
Jesus O
said O
. O

They O
said O
to O
themselves O
, O
`` O
What O
an O
insult O
to O
God O
for O
this O
man O
to O
say O
that O
! O
'' O

Jesus O
knew O
what O
they O
were O
thinking O
. O

So O
he O
said O
, O
`` O
Why O
are O
you O
thinking O
such O
evil O
thoughts O
? O

The O
Son O
of O
Man O
has O
power O
on O
earth O
to O
forgive O
sins O
. O

But O
how O
can O
I O
prove O
this O
to O
you O
? O

Maybe O
you O
are O
thinking O
it O
was O
easy O
for O
me O
to O
say O
, O
' O
Your O
sins O
are O
forgiven O
. O
' O

There O
's O
no O
proof O
that O
it O
really O
happened O
. O

But O
what O
if O
I O
say O
to O
the O
man O
, O
' O
Stand O
up O
and O
walk O
' O
? O

Then O
you O
will O
be O
able O
to O
see O
that O
I O
really O
have O
this O
power O
. O
'' O

So O
Jesus O
said O
to O
the O
paralyzed O
man O
, O
`` O
Stand O
up O
. O

Take O
your O
mat O
and O
go O
home O
. O
'' O

The O
man O
stood O
up O
and O
went O
home O
. O

The O
people O
saw O
this O
and O
they O
were O
amazed O
. O

They O
praised O
God O
for O
letting O
someone O
have O
such O
power O
. O

When O
Jesus O
was O
leaving O
, O
he O
saw O
a O
man O
named O
Matthew O
sitting O
at O
the O
place O
for O
collecting O
taxes O
. O

Jesus O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
Follow O
me O
. O
'' O

So O
he O
got O
up O
and O
followed O
Jesus O
. O

Jesus O
ate O
dinner O
at O
Matthew O
's O
house O
. O

Many O
tax O
collectors O
and O
others O
with O
bad O
reputations O
came O
and O
ate O
with O
him O
and O
his O
followers O
. O

The O
Pharisees O
saw O
that O
Jesus O
was O
eating O
with O
these O
people O
. O

They O
asked O
his O
followers O
, O
`` O
Why O
does O
your O
teacher O
eat O
with O
tax O
collectors O
and O
other O
sinners O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
heard O
them O
say O
this O
. O

So O
he O
said O
to O
them O
, O
`` O
It O
is O
the O
sick O
people O
who O
need O
a O
doctor O
, O
not O
those O
who O
are O
healthy O

You O
need O
to O
go O
and O
learn O
what O
this O
Scripture O
means O
: O
' O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
animal O
sacrifices O
; O
I O
want O
you O
to O
show O
kindness O
to O
people O
. O
' O

I O
did O
not O
come O
to O
invite O
good O
people O
. O

I O
came O
to O
invite O
sinners O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
followers O
of O
John O
came O
to O
Jesus O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
We O
and O
the O
Pharisees O
fast O
often O
, O
but O
your O
followers O
do O
n't O
ever O
fast O

Why O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
At O
a O
wedding O
the O
friends O
of O
the O
bridegroom O
are O
not O
sad O
while O
he O
is O
with O
them O
. O

They O
can O
not O
fast O
then O
. O

But O
the O
time O
will O
come O
when O
the O
bridegroom O
will O
be O
taken O
from O
them O
. O

Then O
they O
will O
fast O
. O

`` O
When O
someone O
sews O
a O
patch O
over O
a O
hole O
in O
an O
old O
coat O
, O
they O
never O
use O
a O
piece O
of O
cloth O
that O
has O
not O
already O
been O
shrunk O
. O

If O
they O
do O
, O
the O
patch O
will O
shrink O
and O
pull O
away O
from O
the O
coat O
. O

Then O
the O
hole O
will O
be O
worse O
. O

Also O
, O
people O
never O
pour O
new O
wine O
into O
old O
wineskins O
. O

They O
would O
break O
, O
the O
wine O
would O
spill O
out O
, O
and O
the O
wineskins O
would O
be O
ruined O
. O

People O
always O
put O
new O
wine O
into O
new O
wineskins O
, O
which O
wo O
n't O
break O
, O
and O
the O
wine O
stays O
good O

'' O

While O
Jesus O
was O
still O
talking O
, O
a O
leader O
of O
the O
synagogue O
came O
to O
him O
. O

The O
leader O
bowed O
down O
before O
him O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
My O
daughter O
has O
just O
died O
. O

But O
if O
you O
will O
come O
and O
touch O
her O
with O
your O
hand O
, O
she O
will O
live O
again O

'' O

So O
Jesus O
and O
his O
followers O
went O
with O
the O
man O
. O

On O
the O
way O
, O
there O
was O
a O
woman O
who O
had O
been O
bleeding O
for O
twelve O
years O
. O

She O
came O
close O
behind O
Jesus O
and O
touched O
the O
bottom O
of O
his O
coat O
. O

She O
was O
thinking O
, O
`` O
If O
I O
can O
touch O
his O
coat O
, O
I O
will O
be O
healed O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
turned O
and O
saw O
the O
woman O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Be O
happy O
, O
dear O
woman O
. O

You O
are O
made O
well O
because O
you O
believed O

'' O

Then O
the O
woman O
was O
healed O
. O

Jesus O
continued O
going O
with O
the O
Jewish O
leader O
and O
went O
into O
the O
leader O
's O
house O
. O

He O
saw O
people O
there O
who O
make O
music O
for O
funerals O
. O

And O
he O
saw O
a O
crowd O
of O
people O
crying O
loudly O
. O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
Go O
away O
. O

The O
girl O
is O
not O
dead O
. O

She O
is O
only O
sleeping O
. O
'' O

But O
the O
people O
laughed O
at O
him O
. O

After O
the O
people O
were O
put O
out O
of O
the O
house O
, O
Jesus O
went O
into O
the O
girl O
's O
room O
. O

He O
held O
the O
girl O
's O
hand O
, O
and O
the O
girl O
stood O
up O
. O

The O
news O
about O
this O
spread O
all O
around O
the O
area O
. O

As O
Jesus O
was O
going O
away O
from O
there O
, O
two O
blind O
men O
followed O
him O
. O

They O
said O
loudly O
, O
`` O
Show O
kindness O
to O
us O
, O
Son O
of O
David O

'' O

Jesus O
went O
inside O
, O
and O
the O
blind O
men O
went O
with O
him O
. O

He O
asked O
them O
, O
`` O
Do O
you O
believe O
that O
I O
am O
able O
to O
make O
you O
see O
again O
? O
'' O

They O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
Lord O
, O
we O
believe O

Then O
Jesus O
touched O
their O
eyes O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
believe O
that O
I O
can O
make O
you O
see O
again O
, O
so O
it O
will O
happen O

'' O

Then O
the O
men O
were O
able O
to O
see O

Jesus O
gave O
them O
a O
strong O
warning O
. O

He O
said O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
tell O
anyone O
about O
this O

But O
they O
left O
and O
spread O
the O
news O
about O
Jesus O
all O
around O
that O
area O
. O

As O
these O
two O
men O
were O
leaving O
, O
some O
people O
brought O
another O
man O
to O
Jesus O
. O

This O
man O
could O
not O
talk O
because O
he O
had O
a O
demon O
inside O
him O
. O

Jesus O
forced O
the O
demon O
out O
, O
and O
the O
man O
was O
able O
to O
talk O

The O
people O
were O
amazed O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
We O
have O
never O
seen O
anything O
like O
this O
in O
Israel O
. O
'' O

But O
the O
Pharisees O
said O
, O
`` O
The O
ruler O
of O
demons O
is O
the O
one O
that O
gives O
him O
power O
to O
force O
demons O
out O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
traveled O
through O
all O
the O
towns O
and O
villages O
. O

He O
taught O
in O
their O
synagogues O
and O
told O
people O
the O
Good O
News O
about O
God O
's O
kingdom O
. O

He O
healed O
all O
kinds O
of O
diseases O
and O
sicknesses O
. O

Jesus O
saw O
the O
many O
people O
and O
felt O
sorry O
for O
them O
because O
they O
were O
worried O
and O
helpless O
-- O
like O
sheep O
without O
a O
shepherd O
to O
lead O
them O
. O

Jesus O
said O
to O
his O
followers O
, O
`` O
There O
is O
such O
a O
big O
harvest O
of O
people O
to O
bring O
in O
. O

But O
there O
are O
only O
a O
few O
workers O
to O
help O
harvest O
them O
. O

God O
owns O
the O
harvest O
. O

Ask O
him O
to O
send O
more O
workers O
to O
help O
gather O
his O
harvest O
. O
'' O

I O
really O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
write O
to O
you O
about O
this O
help O
for O
God O
's O
people O
. O

I O
know O
that O
you O
want O
to O
help O
. O

I O
have O
been O
bragging O
about O
you O
to O
the O
people O
in O
Macedonia O
. O

I O
told O
them O
that O
you O
people O
in O
Achaia O
have O
been O
ready O
to O
give O
since O
last O
year O
. O

And O
your O
desire O
to O
give O
has O
made O
most O
of O
the O
people O
here O
ready O
to O
give O
also O
. O

But O
I O
am O
sending O
the O
brothers O
to O
you O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
want O
our O
bragging O
about O
you O
in O
this O
to O
be O
for O
nothing O
. O

I O
want O
you O
to O
be O
ready O
just O
as O
I O
said O
you O
would O
be O
. O

If O
any O
of O
those O
from O
Macedonia O
come O
with O
me O
, O
and O
they O
find O
that O
you O
are O
not O
ready O
, O
we O
will O
be O
ashamed O
. O

We O
will O
be O
ashamed O
that O
we O
were O
so O
sure O
of O
you O
. O

And O
you O
will O
be O
ashamed O
too O
! O

So O
I O
thought O
that O
I O
should O
ask O
these O
brothers O
to O
come O
there O
before O
we O
do O
. O

They O
will O
help O
in O
getting O
together O
the O
generous O
gift O
you O
promised O
. O

Then O
it O
will O
be O
ready O
when O
we O
come O
, O
and O
it O
will O
be O
seen O
as O
a O
blessing O
you O
are O
giving O
, O
not O
as O
something O
you O
were O
forced O
to O
do O
. O

Remember O
this O
: O
The O
one O
who O
plants O
few O
seeds O
will O
have O
a O
small O
harvest O
. O

But O
the O
one O
who O
plants O
a O
lot O
will O
have O
a O
big O
harvest O
. O

Each O
one O
of O
you O
should O
give O
what O
you O
have O
decided O
in O
your O
heart O
to O
give O
. O

You O
should O
not O
give O
if O
it O
makes O
you O
unhappy O
or O
if O
you O
feel O
forced O
to O
give O
. O

God O
loves O
those O
who O
are O
happy O
to O
give O
. O

And O
God O
can O
give O
you O
more O
blessings O
than O
you O
need O
, O
and O
you O
will O
always O
have O
plenty O
of O
everything O
. O

You O
will O
have O
enough O
to O
give O
to O
every O
good O
work O
. O

As O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
, O
`` O
He O
gives O
generously O
to O
the O
poor O
; O
his O
goodness O
will O
continue O
forever O
. O
'' O

God O
is O
the O
one O
who O
gives O
seed O
to O
those O
who O
plant O
, O
and O
he O
gives O
bread O
for O
food O
. O

And O
God O
will O
give O
you O
spiritual O
seed O
and O
make O
that O
seed O
grow O
. O

He O
will O
produce O
a O
great O
harvest O
from O
your O
goodness O
. O

God O
will O
make O
you O
rich O
in O
every O
way O
so O
that O
you O
can O
always O
give O
freely O
. O

And O
your O
giving O
through O
us O
will O
make O
people O
give O
thanks O
to O
God O
. O

The O
service O
you O
are O
offering O
helps O
God O
's O
people O
with O
their O
needs O
, O
but O
that O
is O
not O
all O
it O
does O
. O

It O
is O
also O
bringing O
more O
and O
more O
thanks O
to O
God O
. O

This O
service O
is O
a O
proof O
of O
your O
faith O
, O
and O
people O
will O
praise O
God O
because O
of O
it O
. O

They O
will O
praise O
him O
because O
you O
are O
following O
the O
message O
about O
Christ O
-- O
the O
message O
you O
say O
you O
believe O
. O

They O
will O
praise O
God O
because O
you O
freely O
share O
with O
them O
and O
with O
all O
people O
. O

And O
when O
they O
pray O
, O
they O
will O
wish O
they O
could O
be O
with O
you O
. O

They O
will O
feel O
this O
way O
because O
of O
the O
great O
grace O
that O
God O
gave O
you O
. O

Thanks O
be O
to O
God O
for O
his O
gift O
that O
is O
too O
wonderful O
to O
describe O
. O

While O
Jesus O
was O
walking O
, O
he O
saw O
a O
man O
who O
had O
been O
blind O
since O
the O
time O
he O
was O
born O
. O

Jesus O
' O
followers O
asked O
him O
, O
`` O
Teacher O
, O
why O
was O
this O
man O
born O
blind O
? O

Whose O
sin O
made O
it O
happen O
? O

Was O
it O
his O
own O
sin O
or O
that O
of O
his O
parents O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
It O
was O
not O
any O
sin O
of O
this O
man O
or O
his O
parents O
that O
caused O
him O
to O
be O
blind O
. O

He O
was O
born O
blind O
so O
that O
he O
could O
be O
used O
to O
show O
what O
great O
things O
God O
can O
do O
. O

While O
it O
is O
daytime O
, O
we O
must O
continue O
doing O
the O
work O
of O
the O
one O
who O
sent O
me O
. O

The O
night O
is O
coming O
, O
and O
no O
one O
can O
work O
at O
night O
. O

While O
I O
am O
in O
the O
world O
, O
I O
am O
the O
light O
of O
the O
world O
. O
'' O

After O
Jesus O
said O
this O
, O
he O
spit O
on O
the O
dirt O
, O
made O
some O
mud O
and O
put O
it O
on O
the O
man O
's O
eyes O
. O

Jesus O
told O
him O
, O
`` O
Go O
and O
wash O
in O
Siloam O
pool O
. O
'' O

-LRB- O
Siloam O
means O
`` O
Sent O
. O
'' O
-RRB- O

So O
the O
man O
went O
to O
the O
pool O
, O
washed O
and O
came O
back O
. O

He O
was O
now O
able O
to O
see O
. O

His O
neighbors O
and O
some O
others O
who O
had O
seen O
him O
begging O
said O
, O
`` O
Look O
! O

Is O
this O
the O
same O
man O
who O
always O
sits O
and O
begs O
? O
'' O

Some O
people O
said O
, O
`` O
Yes O
! O

He O
is O
the O
one O
. O
'' O

But O
others O
said O
, O
`` O
No O
, O
he O
ca O
n't O
be O
the O
same O
man O
. O

He O
only O
looks O
like O
him O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
man O
himself O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
that O
same O
man O
. O
'' O

They O
asked O
, O
`` O
What O
happened O
? O

How O
did O
you O
get O
your O
sight O
? O
'' O

He O
answered O
, O
`` O
The O
man O
they O
call O
Jesus O
made O
some O
mud O
and O
put O
it O
on O
my O
eyes O
. O

Then O
he O
told O
me O
to O
go O
to O
Siloam O
and O
wash O
. O

So O
I O
went O
there O
and O
washed O
. O

And O
then O
I O
could O
see O
. O
'' O

They O
asked O
him O
, O
`` O
Where O
is O
this O
man O
? O
'' O

He O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O
'' O

Then O
the O
people O
brought O
the O
man O
to O
the O
Pharisees O
. O

The O
day O
Jesus O
had O
made O
mud O
and O
healed O
the O
man O
's O
eyes O
was O
a O
Sabbath O
day O
. O

So O
the O
Pharisees O
asked O
the O
man O
, O
`` O
How O
did O
you O
get O
your O
sight O
? O
'' O

He O
answered O
, O
`` O
He O
put O
mud O
on O
my O
eyes O
. O

I O
washed O
, O
and O
now O
I O
can O
see O
. O
'' O

Some O
of O
the O
Pharisees O
said O
, O
`` O
That O
man O
does O
not O
obey O
the O
law O
about O
the O
Sabbath O
day O
. O

So O
he O
is O
not O
from O
God O
. O
'' O

Others O
said O
, O
`` O
But O
someone O
who O
is O
a O
sinner O
can O
not O
do O
these O
miraculous O
signs O
. O
'' O

So O
they O
could O
not O
agree O
with O
each O
other O
. O

They O
asked O
the O
man O
again O
, O
`` O
Since O
it O
was O
your O
eyes O
he O
healed O
, O
what O
do O
you O
say O
about O
him O
? O
'' O

He O
answered O
, O
`` O
He O
is O
a O
prophet O
. O
'' O

The O
Jewish O
leaders O
still O
did O
not O
believe O
that O
this O
really O
happened O
to O
the O
man O
-- O
that O
he O
was O
blind O
and O
was O
now O
healed O
. O

But O
later O
they O
sent O
for O
his O
parents O
. O

They O
asked O
them O
, O
`` O
Is O
this O
your O
son O
? O

You O
say O
he O
was O
born O
blind O
. O

So O
how O
can O
he O
see O
? O
'' O

His O
parents O
answered O
, O
`` O
We O
know O
that O
this O
man O
is O
our O
son O
. O

And O
we O
know O
that O
he O
was O
born O
blind O
. O

But O
we O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
he O
can O
see O
now O
. O

We O
do O
n't O
know O
who O
healed O
his O
eyes O
. O

Ask O
him O
. O

He O
is O
old O
enough O
to O
answer O
for O
himself O
. O
'' O

They O
said O
this O
because O
they O
were O
afraid O
of O
the O
Jewish O
leaders O
. O

The O
leaders O
had O
already O
decided O
that O
they O
would O
punish O
anyone O
who O
said O
Jesus O
was O
the O
Christ O
. O

They O
would O
stop O
them O
from O
coming O
to O
the O
synagogue O
. O

That O
is O
why O
his O
parents O
said O
, O
`` O
He O
is O
old O
enough O
. O

Ask O
him O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
Jewish O
leaders O
called O
the O
man O
who O
had O
been O
blind O
. O

They O
told O
him O
to O
come O
in O
again O
. O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
should O
honor O
God O
by O
telling O
the O
truth O
. O

We O
know O
that O
this O
man O
is O
a O
sinner O
. O
'' O

The O
man O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
he O
is O
a O
sinner O
. O

But O
I O
do O
know O
this O
: O
I O
was O
blind O
, O
and O
now O
I O
can O
see O
. O
'' O

They O
asked O
, O
`` O
What O
did O
he O
do O
to O
you O
? O

How O
did O
he O
heal O
your O
eyes O
? O
'' O

He O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
have O
already O
told O
you O
that O
. O

But O
you O
would O
not O
listen O
to O
me O
. O

Why O
do O
you O
want O
to O
hear O
it O
again O
? O

Do O
you O
want O
to O
be O
his O
followers O
too O
? O
'' O

At O
this O
they O
shouted O
insults O
at O
him O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
are O
his O
follower O
, O
not O
us O
! O

We O
are O
followers O
of O
Moses O
. O

We O
know O
that O
God O
spoke O
to O
Moses O
. O

But O
we O
do O
n't O
even O
know O
where O
this O
man O
comes O
from O
! O
'' O

The O
man O
answered O
, O
`` O
This O
is O
really O
strange O
! O

You O
do O
n't O
know O
where O
he O
comes O
from O
, O
but O
he O
healed O
my O
eyes O
. O

We O
all O
know O
that O
God O
does O
not O
listen O
to O
sinners O
, O
but O
he O
will O
listen O
to O
anyone O
who O
worships O
and O
obeys O
him O
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
time O
we O
have O
ever O
heard O
of O
anyone O
healing O
the O
eyes O
of O
someone O
born O
blind O
. O

This O
man O
must O
be O
from O
God O
. O

If O
he O
were O
not O
from O
God O
, O
he O
could O
not O
do O
anything O
like O
this O
. O
'' O

The O
Jewish O
leaders O
answered O
, O
`` O
You O
were O
born O
full O
of O
sin O
! O

Are O
you O
trying O
to O
teach O
us O
? O
'' O

And O
they O
told O
the O
man O
to O
get O
out O
of O
the O
synagogue O
and O
to O
stay O
out O
. O

When O
Jesus O
heard O
that O
they O
had O
forced O
the O
man O
to O
leave O
, O
he O
found O
him O
and O
asked O
him O
, O
`` O
Do O
you O
believe O
in O
the O
Son O
of O
Man O
? O
'' O

The O
man O
said O
, O
`` O
Tell O
me O
who O
he O
is O
, O
sir O
, O
so O
I O
can O
believe O
in O
him O

Jesus O
said O
to O
him O
, O
`` O
You O
have O
already O
seen O
him O

The O
Son O
of O
Man O
is O
the O
one O
talking O
with O
you O
now O

The O
man O
answered O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
Lord O
! O
'' O

Then O
he O
bowed O
and O
worshiped O
Jesus O
. O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
came O
into O
this O
world O
so O
that O
the O
world O
could O
be O
judged O
. O

I O
came O
so O
that O
people O
who O
are O
blind O
could O
see O
. O

And O
I O
came O
so O
that O
people O
who O
think O
they O
see O
would O
become O
blind O
. O
'' O

Some O
of O
the O
Pharisees O
were O
near O
Jesus O
. O

They O
heard O
him O
say O
this O
. O

They O
asked O
, O
`` O
What O
? O

Are O
you O
saying O
that O
we O
are O
blind O
too O
? O
'' O

Jesus O
said O
, O
`` O
If O
you O
were O
really O
blind O
, O
you O
would O
not O
be O
guilty O
of O
sin O
. O

But O
you O
say O
that O
you O
see O
, O
so O
you O
are O
still O
guilty O
. O
'' O

Then O
Pilate O
ordered O
that O
Jesus O
be O
taken O
away O
and O
whipped O
. O

The O
soldiers O
made O
a O
crown O
from O
thorny O
branches O
and O
put O
it O
on O
his O
head O
. O

Then O
they O
put O
a O
purple O
robe O
around O
him O
. O

They O
kept O
coming O
up O
to O
him O
and O
saying O
, O
`` O
Hail O
to O
the O
king O
of O
the O
Jews O
! O
'' O

And O
they O
hit O
him O
in O
the O
face O
. O

Again O
Pilate O
came O
out O
and O
said O
to O
the O
Jewish O
leaders O
, O
`` O
Look O
! O

I O
am O
bringing O
Jesus O
out O
to O
you O

I O
want O
you O
to O
know O
that O
I O
find O
nothing O

charge O
him O

Then O
Jesus O
came O
out O
wearing O
the O
crown O
of O
thorns O
and O
the O
purple O
robe O
. O

Pilate O
said O
to O
the O
Jews O
, O
`` O
Here O

the O
man O

When O
the O
leading O
priests O

the O
Jewish O
guards O
saw O
Jesus O
they O
shouted O
, O
`` O
Kill O

Kill O
him O
on O
a O

But O
Pilate O
answered O
, O
`` O

him O

nail O
him O

I O

can O
charge O
him O
with O
. O
'' O

The O
Jewish O
leaders O
answered O
, O
`` O
We O
have O
a O
law O
that O
says O
he O
must O
die O
, O
because O
he O
said O
he O
is O
the O
Son O
of O
God O
. O
'' O

When O
Pilate O
heard O
this O
, O
he O
was O
more O
afraid O
. O

So O
he O
went O
back O
inside O
the O
palace O
and O
asked O
Jesus O
, O
`` O
Where O
are O
you O
from O
? O
'' O

But O
Jesus O
did O
not O
answer O
him O
. O

Pilate O
said O
, O
`` O
You O
refuse O
to O
speak O
to O
me O
? O

Remember O
, O
I O
have O
the O
power O
to O
make O
you O
free O
or O
to O
kill O
you O
on O
a O
cross O
. O
'' O

Jesus O
answered O
, O
`` O
The O
only O
power O
you O
have O
over O
me O
is O
the O
power O
given O
to O
you O
by O
God O
. O

So O
the O
one O
who O
handed O
me O
over O
to O
you O
is O
guilty O
of O
a O
greater O
sin O
. O
'' O

After O
this O
, O
Pilate O
tried O
to O
let O
Jesus O
go O
free O
. O

But O
the O
Jewish O
leaders O
shouted O
, O
`` O
Anyone O
who O
makes O
himself O
a O
king O
is O
against O
Caesar O
. O

So O
if O
you O
let O
this O
man O
go O
free O
, O
that O
means O
you O
are O
not O
Caesar O
's O
friend O
. O
'' O

When O
Pilate O
heard O
this O
, O
he O
brought O
Jesus O
out O
to O
the O
place O
called O
`` O
The O
Stone O
Pavement O
. O
'' O

-LRB- O
In O
Aramaic O
the O
name O
is O
Gabbatha O
. O
-RRB- O

Pilate O
sat O
down O
on O
the O
judge O
's O
seat O
there O
. O

It O
was O
now O
almost O
noon O
on O
Preparation O
day O
of O
Passover O
week O
. O

Pilate O
said O
to O
the O
Jews O
, O
`` O
Here O
is O
your O
king O
! O
'' O

They O
shouted O
, O
`` O
Take O
him O
away O
! O

Take O
him O
away O
! O

Kill O
him O
on O
a O
cross O
! O
'' O

Pilate O
asked O
them O
, O
`` O
Do O
you O
want O
me O
to O
kill O
your O
king O
on O
a O
cross O
? O
'' O

The O
leading O
priests O
answered O
, O
`` O
The O
only O
king O
we O
have O
is O
Caesar O
! O
'' O

So O
Pilate O
handed O
Jesus O
over O
to O
them O
to O
be O
killed O
on O
a O
cross O
. O

The O
soldiers O
took O
Jesus O
. O

He O
carried O
his O
own O
cross O
to O
a O
place O
called O
`` O
The O
Place O
of O
the O
Skull O
. O
'' O

-LRB- O
In O
Aramaic O
the O
name O
of O
this O
place O
is O
`` O
Golgotha O
. O
'' O
-RRB- O

There O
they O
nailed O
Jesus O
to O
the O
cross O
. O

They O
also O
nailed O
two O
other O
men O
to O
crosses O
. O

They O
put O
them O
on O
each O
side O
of O
Jesus O
with O
him O
in O
the O
middle O
. O

Pilate O
told O
them O
to O
write O
a O
sign O
and O
put O
it O
on O
the O
cross O
. O

The O
sign O
said O
, O
`` O
jesus O
of O
nazareth O
, O
the O
king O
of O
the O
jews O
. O
'' O

The O
sign O
was O
written O
in O
Aramaic O
, O
in O
Latin O
, O
and O
in O
Greek O
. O

Many O
of O
the O
Jews O
read O
this O
sign O
, O
because O
the O
place O
where O
Jesus O
was O
nailed O
to O
the O
cross O
was O
near O
the O
city O
. O

The O
leading O
Jewish O
priests O
said O
to O
Pilate O
, O
`` O
Do O
n't O
write O
, O
' O
The O
King O
of O
the O
Jews O
. O
' O

But O
write O
, O
' O
This O
man O
said O
, O
I O
am O
the O
King O
of O
the O
Jews O
. O
' O
'' O

Pilate O
answered O
, O
`` O
I O
will O
not O
change O
what O
I O
have O
written O
. O
'' O

After O
the O
soldiers O
nailed O
Jesus O
to O
the O
cross O
, O
they O
took O
his O
clothes O
and O
divided O
them O
into O
four O
parts O
. O

Each O
soldier O
got O
one O
part O
. O

They O
also O
took O
his O
tunic O
. O

It O
was O
all O
one O
piece O
of O
cloth O
woven O
from O
top O
to O
bottom O
. O

So O
the O
soldiers O
said O
to O
each O
other O
, O
`` O
We O
should O
not O
tear O
this O
into O
parts O
. O

Let O
's O
throw O
lots O
to O
see O
who O
will O
get O
it O
. O
'' O

This O
happened O
to O
make O
clear O
the O
full O
meaning O
of O
what O
the O
Scriptures O
say O
: O
`` O
They O
divided O
my O
clothes O
among O
them O
, O
and O
they O
threw O
lots O
for O
what O
I O
was O
wearing O
. O
'' O

So O
the O
soldiers O
did O
this O
. O

Jesus O
' O
mother O
stood O
near O
his O
cross O
. O

Her O
sister O
was O
also O
standing O
there O
with O
Mary O
the O
wife O
of O
Clopas O
, O
and O
Mary O
Magdalene O
. O

Jesus O
saw O
his O
mother O
. O

He O
also O
saw O
the O
follower O
he O
loved O
very O
much O
standing O
there O
. O

He O
said O
to O
his O
mother O
, O
`` O
Dear O
woman O
, O
here O
is O
your O
son O
. O
'' O

Then O
he O
said O
to O
the O
follower O
, O
`` O
Here O
is O
your O
mother O
. O
'' O

So O
after O
that O
, O
this O
follower O
took O
Jesus O
' O
mother O
to O
live O
in O
his O
home O
. O

Later O
, O
Jesus O
knew O
that O
everything O
had O
been O
done O
. O

To O
make O
the O
Scriptures O
come O
true O
he O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
thirsty O
. O
'' O

There O
was O
a O
jar O
full O
of O
sour O
wine O
there O
, O
so O
the O
soldiers O
soaked O
a O
sponge O
in O
it O
. O

They O
put O
the O
sponge O
on O
a O
branch O
of O
a O
hyssop O
plant O
and O
lifted O
it O
to O
Jesus O
' O
mouth O
. O

When O
he O
tasted O
the O
wine O
, O
he O
said O
, O
`` O
It O
is O
finished O
. O
'' O

Then O
he O
bowed O
his O
head O
and O
died O
. O

This O
day O
was O
Preparation O
day O
. O

The O
next O
day O
was O
a O
special O
Sabbath O
day O
. O

The O
Jewish O
leaders O
did O
not O
want O
the O
bodies O
to O
stay O
on O
the O
cross O
on O
the O
Sabbath O
day O
. O

So O
they O
asked O
Pilate O
to O
order O
that O
the O
legs O
of O
the O
men O
be O
broken O
. O

And O
they O
asked O
that O
the O
bodies O
be O
taken O
down O
from O
the O
crosses O
. O

So O
the O
soldiers O
came O
and O
broke O
the O
legs O
of O
the O
two O
men O
on O
the O
crosses O
beside O
Jesus O
. O

But O
when O
the O
soldiers O
came O
close O
to O
Jesus O
, O
they O
saw O
that O
he O
was O
already O
dead O
. O

So O
they O
did O
not O
break O
his O
legs O
. O

But O
one O
of O
the O
soldiers O
stuck O
his O
spear O
into O
Jesus O
' O

side O
. O

Immediately O
blood O
and O
water O
came O
out O
. O

-LRB- O
The O
one O
who O
saw O
this O
happen O
has O
told O
about O
it O
. O

He O
told O
about O
it O
so O
that O
you O
also O
can O
believe O
. O

The O
things O
he O
says O
are O
true O
. O

He O
knows O
that O
he O
tells O
the O
truth O
. O
-RRB- O

These O
things O
happened O
to O
give O
full O
meaning O
to O
the O
Scriptures O
that O
said O
, O
`` O
None O
of O
his O
bones O
will O
be O
broken O
'' O

and O
`` O
People O
will O
look O
at O
the O
one O
they O
stabbed O
. O
'' O

Later O
, O
a O
man O
named O
Joseph O
from O
Arimathea O
asked O
Pilate O
for O
the O
body O
of O
Jesus O
. O

-LRB- O
Joseph O
was O
a O
follower O
of O
Jesus O
, O
but O
he O
did O
not O
tell O
anyone O
, O
because O
he O
was O
afraid O
of O
the O
Jewish O
leaders O
. O
-RRB- O

Pilate O
said O
Joseph O
could O
take O
Jesus O
' O
body O
, O
so O
he O
came O
and O
took O
it O
away O
. O

Nicodemus O
went O
with O
Joseph O
. O

He O
was O
the O
man O
who O
had O
come O
to O
Jesus O
before O
and O
talked O
to O
him O
at O
night O
. O

He O
brought O
about O
100 O
pounds O
of O
spices O
-- O
a O
mixture O
of O
myrrh O
and O
aloes O
. O

These O
two O
men O
took O
Jesus O
' O
body O
and O
wrapped O
it O
in O
pieces O
of O
linen O
cloth O
with O
the O
spices O
. O

-LRB- O
This O
is O
how O
the O
Jews O
bury O
people O
. O
-RRB- O

In O
the O
place O
where O
Jesus O
was O
killed O
on O
the O
cross O
, O
there O
was O
a O
garden O
. O

In O
the O
garden O
there O
was O
a O
new O
tomb O
. O

No O
one O
had O
ever O
been O
buried O
there O
before O
. O

The O
men O
put O
Jesus O
in O
that O
tomb O
because O
it O
was O
near O
, O
and O
the O
Jews O
were O
preparing O
to O
start O
their O
Sabbath O
day O
. O

The O
fifth O
angel O
blew O
his O
trumpet O
. O

Then O
I O
saw O
a O
star O
fall O
from O
the O
sky O
to O
the O
earth O
. O

The O
star O
was O
given O
the O
key O
to O
the O
deep O
hole O
that O
leads O
down O
to O
the O
bottomless O
pit O
. O

Then O
the O
star O
opened O
the O
hole O
leading O
to O
the O
pit O
. O

Smoke O
came O
up O
from O
the O
hole O
like O
smoke O
from O
a O
big O
furnace O
. O

The O
sun O
and O
sky O
became O
dark O
because O
of O
the O
smoke O
from O
the O
hole O
. O

Then O
locusts O
came O
out O
of O
the O
smoke O
and O
went O
down O
to O
the O
earth O
. O

They O
were O
given O
the O
power O
to O
sting O
like O
scorpions O
. O

They O
were O
told O
not O
to O
damage O
the O
fields O
of O
grass O
or O
any O
plant O
or O
tree O
. O

They O
were O
to O
hurt O
only O
those O
who O
did O
not O
have O
God O
's O
mark O
on O
their O
foreheads O
. O

They O
were O
not O
given O
the O
power O
to O
kill O
them O
but O
only O
to O
cause O
them O
pain O
for O
five O
months O
-- O
pain O
like O
a O
person O
feels O
when O
stung O
by O
a O
scorpion O
. O

During O
those O
days O
people O
will O
look O
for O
a O
way O
to O
die O
, O
but O
they O
will O
not O
find O
it O
. O

They O
will O
want O
to O
die O
, O
but O
death O
will O
hide O
from O
them O
. O

The O
locusts O
looked O
like O
horses O
prepared O
for O
battle O
. O

On O
their O
heads O
they O
wore O
something O
that O
looked O
like O
a O
gold O
crown O
. O

Their O
faces O
looked O
like O
human O
faces O
. O

Their O
hair O
was O
like O
women O
's O
hair O
. O

Their O
teeth O
were O
like O
lions O
' O
teeth O
. O

Their O
chests O
looked O
like O
iron O
breastplates O
. O

The O
sound O
their O
wings O
made O
was O
like O
the O
noise O
of O
many O
horses O
and O
chariots O
hurrying O
into O
battle O
. O

The O
locusts O
had O
tails O
with O
stingers O
like O
scorpions O
. O

The O
power O
they O
had O
to O
give O
people O
pain O
for O
five O
months O
was O
in O
their O
tails O
. O

They O
had O
a O
ruler O
, O
who O
was O
the O
angel O
of O
the O
bottomless O
pit O
. O

His O
name O
in O
Hebrew O
is O
Abaddon O
. O

In O
Greek O
it O
is O
Apollyon O
. O

The O
first O
terror O
is O
now O
past O
. O

There O
are O
still O
two O
other O
terrors O
to O
come O
. O

The O
sixth O
angel O
blew O
his O
trumpet O
. O

Then O
I O
heard O
a O
voice O
coming O
from O
the O
horns O
on O
the O
four O
corners O
of O
the O
golden O
altar O
that O
is O
before O
God O
. O

It O
said O
to O
the O
sixth O
angel O
who O
had O
the O
trumpet O
, O
`` O
Free O
the O
four O
angels O
who O
are O
tied O
at O
the O
great O
river O
Euphrates O

'' O

These O
four O
angels O
had O
been O
kept O
ready O
for O
this O
hour O
and O
day O
and O
month O
and O
year O
. O

The O
angels O
were O
set O
free O
to O
kill O
a O
third O
of O
all O
the O
people O
on O
the O
earth O
. O

I O
heard O
how O
many O
troops O
on O
horses O
were O
in O
their O
army O
. O

There O
were O
200 O
, O
000 O
, O
000 O
. O

In O
my O
vision O
, O
I O
saw O
the O
horses O
and O
the O
riders O
on O
the O
horses O
. O

They O
looked O
like O
this O
: O
They O
had O
breastplates O
that O
were O
fiery O
red O
, O
dark O
blue O
, O
and O
yellow O
like O
sulfur O
. O

The O
heads O
of O
the O
horses O
looked O
like O
heads O
of O
lions O
. O

The O
horses O
had O
fire O
, O
smoke O
, O
and O
sulfur O
coming O
out O
of O
their O
mouths O
. O

A O
third O
of O
all O
the O
people O
on O
earth O
were O
killed O
by O
these O
three O
plagues O
coming O
out O
of O
the O
horses O
' O
mouths O
: O
the O
fire O
, O
the O
smoke O
, O
and O
the O
sulfur O
. O

The O
horses O
' O
power O
was O
in O
their O
mouths O
and O
also O
in O
their O
tails O
. O

Their O
tails O
were O
like O
snakes O
that O
have O
heads O
to O
bite O
and O
hurt O
people O
. O

The O
other O
people O
on O
earth O
were O
not O
killed O
by O
these O
plagues O
. O

But O
these O
people O
still O
did O
not O
change O
their O
hearts O
and O
turn O
away O
from O
worshiping O
the O
things O
they O
had O
made O
with O
their O
own O
hands O
. O

They O
did O
not O
stop O
worshiping O
demons O
and O
idols O
made O
of O
gold O
, O
silver O
, O
bronze O
, O
stone O
, O
and O
wood O
-- O
things O
that O
can O
not O
see O
or O
hear O
or O
walk O

They O
did O
not O
change O
their O
hearts O
and O
turn O
away O
from O
killing O
other O
people O
or O
from O
their O
evil O
magic O
, O
their O
sexual O
sins O
, O
and O
their O
stealing O
. O

After O
this O
I O
heard O
what O
sounded O
like O
a O
large O
crowd O
of O
people O
in O
heaven O
. O

The O
people O
were O
saying O
, O
`` O
Hallelujah O

Victory O

to O

She O
is O
the O
one O
who O
ruined O
the O
earth O
with O
her O

God O
has O
punished O
the O
prostitute O
to O
pay O
her O
back O
for O
the O
death O

These O
people O
also O
said O

`` O
Hallelujah O

She O
is O
burning O
and O
her O
smoke O
will O
rise O
forever O

ever O

Then O
the O
24 O
elders O
and O
the O
four O
living O
beings O
bowed O
down O
. O

They O
worshiped O
God O
, O
who O
sits O
on O
the O
throne O

They O
said O
, O
`` O
Amen O

Then O
a O
voice O
came O
from O

said O

Then O
I O
heard O
something O
that O
sounded O
like O
a O
large O
crowd O
of O

It O
was O
as O
loud O
as O

Then O
the O
angel O
said O
to O
me O
, O
`` O

the O

`` O

Then O
I O
bowed O
down O
before O
the O

feet O
to O
worship O
him O

But O
the O
angel O
said O
to O
me O
, O
`` O
Do O

worship O
me O

I O
am O
a O

Then O
I O
saw O
heaven O
open O

There O
before O
me O
was O
a O
white O
horse O
. O

The O
rider O
on O
the O
horse O
was O
called O
Faithful O
and O
True O
, O
because O
he O
is O
right O
in O
his O
judging O
and O
in O
making O
war O
. O

His O
eyes O
were O
like O
burning O
fire O

He O
had O
many O
crowns O
on O
his O
head O
. O

A O
name O
was O
written O
on O
him O
, O
but O
he O
was O
the O
only O
one O
who O
knew O
its O
meaning O
. O

He O
was O
dressed O
in O
a O
robe O
dipped O
in O
blood O
, O
and O
he O
was O
called O
the O
Word O
of O
God O

The O
armies O
of O
heaven O
were O
following O
the O
rider O
on O
the O
white O
horse O

They O
were O
also O
riding O
white O
horses O
. O

They O
were O
dressed O
in O
fine O
linen O
, O
white O
and O
clean O
. O

A O
sharp O
sword O
came O
out O
of O
the O
rider O
's O
mouth O
, O
a O
sword O
that O
he O
would O
use O
to O
defeat O
the O
nations O
. O

And O
he O
will O
rule O
the O
nations O
with O
a O
rod O
of O
iron O
. O

He O
will O
crush O
the O
grapes O
in O
the O
winepress O
of O
the O
terrible O
anger O
of O
God O
All O

Powerful O

On O
his O
robe O
and O
on O
his O
leg O
was O
written O
this O
name O
: O
king O
of O

Then O
I O
saw O
an O
angel O
standing O
in O
the O
sun O
. O

In O
a O
loud O
voice O
the O
angel O
said O
to O
all O
the O
birds O
flying O
in O
the O
sky O
, O
`` O
Come O
together O
for O
the O
great O
supper O

Come O
together O
so O
that O

of O

men O

Come O
to O

the O
bodies O
of O
all O
people O

Then O
I O
saw O
the O
beast O
and O
the O
rulers O
of O
the O
earth O
. O

Their O
armies O
were O
gathered O
together O
to O
make O
war O
against O
the O
rider O
on O
the O
horse O
and O
his O
army O
. O

But O
the O
beast O
was O
captured O
, O
and O
the O
false O
prophet O
was O
also O
captured O
. O

He O
was O
the O
one O
who O
did O
the O
miracles O
for O
the O
beast O

He O
had O
used O
these O
miracles O
to O
trick O
those O
who O
had O
the O
mark O
of O
the O
beast O
and O
worshiped O
its O
idol O
. O

The O
false O
prophet O
and O
the O
beast O
were O
thrown O
alive O
into O
the O
lake O
of O
fire O
that O
burns O
with O
sulfur O
. O

Their O
armies O
were O
killed O
with O
the O
sword O
that O
came O
out O
of O
the O
mouth O
of O
the O
rider O
on O
the O
horse O
. O

All O
the O
birds O
ate O
these O
bodies O
until O
they O
were O
full O
