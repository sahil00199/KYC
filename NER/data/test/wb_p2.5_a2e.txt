Today O
I O
watched O
the O
news O
promoted O
by O
the O
American B-NORP
, O
Zionist B-NORP
, O
and O
Arab B-NORP
-LRB- O
Zionistic B-NORP
-RRB- O
media O
about O
the O
meetings O
currently O
being O
held O
between O
the O
American B-NORP
agents O
in O
Jordan B-GPE
, O
Saudi B-GPE
Arabia I-GPE
, O
Iran B-GPE
, O
and O
Egypt B-GPE
. O

Except O
for O
Sheikh B-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Dari I-PERSON
, O
the O
people O
that O
appeared O
at O
the O
meetings O
with O
them O
were O
mostly O
agents O
of O
the O
occupier O
who O
came O
with O
him O
, O
using O
them O
to O
slaughter O
our O
people O
and O
families O
. O

A O
number O
of O
them O
did O
not O
visit O
Iraq B-GPE
since O
their O
contract O
with O
the O
American B-NORP
intelligence O
service O
expired O
after O
the O
criminal O
Allawi B-PERSON
fled O
two B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago O
in O
the O
wake O
of O
his O
failure O
to O
achieve O
victory O
over O
the O
Iranian B-NORP
agents O
. O

As O
for O
Sheikh O
al O
- O
Dari O
... O
the O
issuing O
of O
a O
warrant O
for O
his O
arrest O
was O
an O
important O
part O
of O
the O
game O
to O
keep O
him O
outside O
Iraq B-GPE
to O
facilitate O
contacting O
him O
-LRB- O
by O
coersion O
-RRB- O
and O
with O
not O
many O
options O
. O

But O
Sheikh B-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Dari I-PERSON
will O
not O
swallow O
the O
bait O
easily O
.. O

He O
is O
aware O
of O
what O
is O
being O
plotted O
.. O
and O
that O
Bush B-PERSON
has O
not O
yet O
lost O
hope O
in O
the O
possibility O
of O
winning O
a O
political O
round O
which O
would O
prolong O
the O
life O
of O
his O
troops O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
.. O

Therefore O
it O
is O
the O
duty O
of O
Sheikh B-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Dari I-PERSON
to O
present O
the O
conditions O
of O
resistance O
- O
victorious O
with O
God B-PERSON
's O
permission O
- O
because O
it O
is O
what O
will O
forge O
victory O
with O
the O
blood O
and O
lives O
of O
its O
youth O
and O
people O
. O

Recently O
published O
Saudi B-NORP
studies O
warned O
that O
kohl B-PRODUCT
is O
harmful O
to O
women O
's O
eyes O
and O
can O
lead O
to O
loss O
of O
sight O
, O
especially O
the O
types O
common O
in O
Arab B-NORP
and O
Gulf B-NORP
countries O
because O
they O
contain O
high O
levels O
of O
lead O
. O

Protecting O
the O
eyes O
against O
blindness O
begins O
with O
measures O
to O
look O
after O
the O
eyes O
, O
from O
regular O
eye O
tests O
by O
a O
specialist O
doctor O
, O
to O
knowing O
the O
necessary O
precautions O
to O
avoid O
eye O
injuries O
and O
first O
aid O
methods O
should O
an O
injury O
occur O
and O
the O
importance O
of O
not O
applying O
the O
kohl B-PRODUCT
commonly O
used O
in O
the B-GPE
Kingdom I-GPE
and O
also O
not O
to O
apply O
any O
other O
folk O
remedies O
on O
the O
eyes O
. O

With O
regard O
to O
kohl B-PRODUCT
and O
its O
effect O
on O
the O
eyes O
, O
doctors O
at O
King B-FAC
Faisal I-FAC
Specialist I-FAC
Hospital I-FAC
have O
found O
that O
the O
percentage O
of O
lead O
in O
random O
samples O
of O
kohl B-PRODUCT
of O
the O
kind O
sold O
at O
perfumeries O
and O
available O
in O
shops O
, O
especially O
Indian B-NORP
brands O
, O
is O
between O
85 B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
and I-PERCENT
100 I-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
per O
gram B-QUANTITY
of O
kohl B-PRODUCT
. O

Doctors O
explained O
that O
this O
percentage O
of O
lead O
is O
harmful O
for O
the O
eyes O
, O
especially O
in O
children O
after O
it O
was O
found O
that O
there O
is O
a O
link O
between O
using O
kohl B-PRODUCT
and O
lead O
poisoning O
in O
children O
, O
and O
the O
brain O
disorders O
it O
causes O
because O
children O
's O
eyes O
can O
not O
produce O
tears O
to O
wash O
external O
pollutants O
out O
of O
the O
eyes O
. O

This O
can O
cause O
acute O
eye O
infections O
. O

They O
indicated O
that O
disorders O
such O
as O
these O
lead O
to O
a O
25 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
increase O
in O
the O
death O
rate O
in O
children O
. O

Specialists O
warned O
against O
the O
false O
but O
commonly O
held O
belief O
that O
kohl B-PRODUCT
improves O
vision O
, O
increases O
the O
thickness O
and O
strength O
of O
eyelashes O
and O
makes O
the O
eyebrows O
thicker O
. O

They O
recommended O
using O
kohl B-PRODUCT
pencils O
which O
are O
sold O
in O
pharmacies O
, O
because O
they O
contain O
carbon O
and O
iron O
, O
both O
of O
which O
do O
not O
affects O
the O
eye O
and O
its O
health O
. O

The O
wave O
of O
continuous O
rain O
last O
week O
led O
to O
the O
collapse O
of O
the O
roof O
of O
the O
Fourth B-FAC
Aramco O
Primary O
School O
for O
Girls O
in O
low O

Fortunately O
, O
the O
school O
had O
no O
students O
in O
it O
during O
the O
collapse O
. O

The O
students O
did O
not O
take O
the O
monthly O
exam O
at O
the O
time O
, O
while O
the B-ORG
administration I-ORG
offered O
a O
one O

day O
vacation O
to O
allow O
for O
a O
search O
for O
another O
school O
. O

The O
students O
were O
transferred O
to O
a O
governmental O
school O
until O
the B-FAC
Aramco I-FAC
School I-FAC
could O
be O
repaired O
. O

The O

" O
The O
situation O
is O
totally O
different O

We O
study O
in O
the O

of O
the B-FAC

and O
we O
have O
been O
merged O
with O
two O

" O

The O
funniest O
thing O
about O
this O
issue O
is O
that O
they O
converted O
the O
small O

said O
the O

resulted O
from O

It O
is O
worth O
mentioning O
that O
there O
has O
been O
a O
total O

by O

authorities O

Since O
the O
outbreak O
of O
the O
Iranian B-NORP
Revolution O
in O
the O
year O
1979 B-DATE
and O
the O
overthrow O
of O
the O
Shah B-PERSON

regime O
, O
and O
in O

of O
the O

the O

in O
the O

-LRB- O
the O
SAVAK O
Agency O

, O
the O
Iranian B-NORP
public O
was O
able O
to O
overthrow O
the O
government O
through O
the O
leadership O
of O
the O
Mullahs B-NORP
-LRB- O
religious O
men O
-RRB- O
without O
action O
from O
the O
super O
powers O
which O
had O
supported O
the O
Shah B-PERSON
's O
regime O
. O

This O
raises O
many O
questions O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
that O
the O
Mullahs B-NORP
came O
to O
power O
in O
Iran B-GPE
, O
another O
revolution O
erupted O
, O
but O
with O
a O
different O
course O
. O

It O
took O
place O
in O
Afghanistan B-GPE
in O
1979 B-DATE
under O
the O
leadership O
of O
a O
few O
people O
led O
by O
the O
Engineer O
Gulbuddin B-PERSON
Hekmatyar B-PERSON
and O
Sheikh B-PERSON
Abdul I-PERSON
Rabb I-PERSON
Rasoul I-PERSON
Sayyaf I-PERSON
. O

But O
the O
general O
course O
of O
jihad O
and O
the O
influx O
of O
mujahideen B-NORP
in O
large O
numbers O
started O
in O
1986 B-DATE
after O
the O
heroic O
Ansar O
battle O
in O
Jagi B-GPE
. O

While O
the O
Arab B-NORP
and O
Western B-NORP
governments O
were O
busy O
with O
the O
issue O
of O
repelling O
Soviet B-NORP
occupation O
and O
communist B-NORP
encroachment O
, O
and O
with O
the O
war O
between O
Iraq B-GPE
and O
Iran B-GPE
, O
many O
overlooked O
a O
new O
development O
that O
was O
emerging O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
namely O
the O
orientation O
of O
Shiites B-NORP
in O
the B-LOC
Gulf I-LOC
region I-LOC
towards O
arms O
training O
in O
Iran B-GPE
, O
with O
the B-NORP
Revolutionary I-NORP
Guards I-NORP
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
Iraqi B-GPE
- O
Iranian B-NORP
war O
, O
as O
well O
as O
in O
Lebanon B-GPE
, O
with O
Hezbollah B-NORP
-LRB- O
in O
the B-DATE
nineties I-DATE
-RRB- O
. O

However O
, O
the O
general O
orientation O
of O
the O
Shiites B-NORP
towards O
regular O
and O
intensive O
training O
actually O
started O
in O
the O
early O
nineties B-DATE

Many O
confusing O
questions O
have O
been O
taxing O
my O
mind O
for O
years O
about O
Egypt B-GPE
and O
its O
people O
. O

Are O
they O
really O
as O
miserable O
as O
we O
see O
them O
, O
or O
are O
our O
eyes O
deceiving O
us O
? O

Are O
the O
horrible O
statistics O
we O
read O
on O
the O
unemployment O
rates O
and O
the O
dangerous O
diseases O
that O
consume O
the O
liver O
, O
kidneys O
, O
and O
the O
entire O
body O
of O
the O
Egyptian B-NORP
real O
, O
or O
a O
fabrication O
of O
the O
nice O
governor O
? O

Is O
the O
waste O
of O
Egypt B-GPE
's O
wealth O
from O
the B-DATE
seventies I-DATE
until O
today O
a O
reality O
, O
or O
an O
illusion O
? O

How O
did O
Egypt B-GPE
's O
production O
of O
long O
- O
fiber O
cotton O
, O
the O
best O
in O
the O
world O
, O
drop O
from O
12 B-QUANTITY
million I-QUANTITY
tons I-QUANTITY
to O
just O
four B-QUANTITY
tons I-QUANTITY
? O

How O
was O
almost O
all O
the O
public O
sector O
sold O
, O
and O
where O
is O
its O
price O
? O

How O
did O
the O
Egyptian B-NORP
become O
the O
cheapest O
human O
being O
on O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
earth O
? O

Is O
this O
reasonable O
? O

Can O
we O
believe O
all O
this O
and O
believe O
at O
the O
same O
time O
that O
the O
people O
are O
still O
silent O
? O

What O
are O
these O
Egyptian B-NORP
people O
? O

How O
are O
they O
? O

How O
do O
they O
think O
? O

Why O
are O
they O
silent O
? O

Are O
they O
that O
cowardly O
? O

I O
do O
not O
stray O
far O
from O
the O
truth O
if O
I O
say O
that O
I O
have O
read O
a O
lot O
in O
sociology O

from O
the O

what O

Egypt B-GPE

do O
not O
