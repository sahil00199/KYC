one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O

my O

no O
in O

disparage O

And O
it O

part O

the O
general O
continuing O
insecurity O

um O
I O
'm O
afraid O

plagued O

criticism O

I O
believe O
it O

important O

the O

recognized O

it O

so O
much O
harder O

on O
that O

you O
put O

their O

how O
does O
that O

your O
perception O

you O

you O
must O
have O
been O
a O
little O
bit O
nervous O

what O
the O
safety O

Well O
I O
'll O
tell O
you O
what O
's O
really O
frustrating O
from O
a O

point O

view O

who O
have O

Beirut B-GPE

nearly B-DATE
five I-DATE

by O
the O
end O

thought O
the O
best O

knew O
more O

I O
always O
thought O
the O
best O
compliment O
you O
could O

when O
you O
told O

you O
were O
moving O

you O

move O
around O

the O
freedom O
you O
want O

And O
the O
brave O

are O
there O
every B-DATE

do O
n't O
have O
that O
freedom O

And O
therefore O
it O
's O
limited O
/. O

and O
in O
fact O
as O
you O
know O
the O
administration O
says O
because O
of O
the O
security O
situation O

maybe O
because O
of O
some O
biases O

There O

a O
lot O
of O
progress O

're O
not O

Do O
you O
think O
that O
is O
a O
credible O
argument O
at O
this O
point O

And O
that O
's O
why O
we O
get O
surprises O

Uh O
that O
's O
why O
we O

we O

more O

no O

Rita B-EVENT

Tom B-PERSON
DeLay I-PERSON

Harriet B-PERSON
Miers I-PERSON

Valerie B-PERSON
Plame I-PERSON

now O
by O
this O
Pakistan B-GPE
earthquake O

Um O
inevitable O
with O
a O
war O
that O
drags O
on O
and O
on O

and O
these O
are O
all O
also O
important O
stories O
obviously O
/. O

but O
uh O
do O
you O
feel O
it O
's O
getting O
the O
attention O
that O
it O
should O

Yeah O
/. O

No O
because O
to O
me O
this O
is O
the O
whole O
ballgame O
of O
the O
Bush B-PERSON
administration O
/. O

Katrina B-EVENT
and O
Rita B-EVENT
they O
'll O
come O
and O
go O
/. O

but O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
day O
the O
Bush B-PERSON
administration O
made O
a O
very O
big O
claim O
um O
that O
it O
could O
go O
to O
Iraq B-GPE
um O
and O
produce O
a O
decent O
forward O
looking O
government O
there O
/. O

If O
that O
happens O
then O
I O
think O
President O
Bush B-PERSON
is O
going O
to O
have O
a O
very O
huge O
quiver O
you O
know O
in O
his O
uh O
legacy O
there O

Um O
if O
it O
does O
n't O
happen O
I O
think O
uh O
the O
administration O
will O
be O
seen O
as O
a O
complete O
and O
utter O
failure O
/. O

so O
everything O
rides O
on O
this O
not O
just O
for O
the O
administration O
though O
but O
for O
the O
American B-NORP
people O
/. O

These O
are O
huge O
stakes O
involved O
/. O

And O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
gotten O
the O
attention O
it O
's O
deserved O
/. O

And O
going O
back O
again O
to O
one O
of O
your O
Iraq B-GPE
collumns O
uh O
you O
observed O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
military O
there O
which O
after O
all O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
increasingly O
shouldering O
the O
burden O
of O
this O
conflict O
/. O

The O
slightly O
ragged O
quality O
left O
you O
feeling O
you O
write O
that O
if O
you O
pulled O
the O
US B-GPE
and O
British B-NORP
advisors O
out O
tomorrow B-DATE
the O
whole O
Iraqi B-NORP
navy O
would O
collapse O
/. O

That O
's O
a O
pretty O
pessimistic O
assessment O
and O
clearly O
at O
odds O
with O
what O
the B-ORG
White I-ORG
House I-ORG

the B-ORG
Defense I-ORG

/. O

Not O
at O
odds O

what O
actually O
the O
military O

have O
been O
saying O

is O
that O
the O
number O

trained O
Iraqi B-NORP

you O

gap O

the O

you O

where O
you O

the O

I O

the B-ORG

the B-ORG
Washington I-ORG
Post I-ORG
were O
reporting O
that O
federal O
authorities O
were O
playing O
down O
the O
threat O
as O
noncredible O

But O
the O
TV O
coverage O
kept O
rolling O
down O
the O
track O
like O
the O
number B-CARDINAL
four I-CARDINAL
express O
/. O

Finally O
last B-DATE
Tuesday I-DATE
some O
newspapers O
and O
then O
the O
cable O

reported O
that O
the O
whole O
thing O
was O
a O
hoax O

The O
CBS B-ORG
evening B-TIME
news O
gave O
that O
three B-CARDINAL

Well O
Jim B-PERSON

But O
that O

In O
an O
age O
of O

such O
threats O
obviously O
need O
to O
be O
reported O
/. O

but O
given O
the O
unreliability O
of O

television O
ought O
to O
learn O
a O
lesson O
here O
about O
not O
going O
on O
high O
alert O
and O
scaring O
people O

When O
we O
come O
back O
one B-CARDINAL
