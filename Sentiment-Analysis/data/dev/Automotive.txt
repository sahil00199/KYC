0,Only complaint I have is that these do not come with instructions on how to remove the old lights to install the new ones. Look great and really change the character of the truck.
0,Works great. Inexpensive and gets the job done. I can't ask for more.
0,I bought these wheels to replace the factory chrome clad wheels on my 2013 Ram 1500 Express. I'm in the process of blacking out my truck and these wheels really fit the bill. The tire shop was able to transfer the TPMS sensors from the factory wheels to these with no problem. I mounted a set of Nitto tires and they took very little wheel weights to balance. The truck rides just as smooth as factory, no shaking or shimming. These wheels fit great and look awesome! Factory lug nuts will not work, you will need to buy a new set. The wheel center caps are plastic and are held on with 3 allen head bolts. So far I've put 5000 miles on them with no problems, and they clean very easly. I would highly recommed.
0,Fit perfect
0,wow best mats I've seen
0,Does the job.
0,Great polish.
0,I bought this fuse system for my escort radar 9500ix and it works really nice. Will recomend it to anyone...
0,I'm ready to go now!!
0,I'm impressed with these mounts.  I hesitated to buy them at first fearing that they would be flimsy and easily bent.  Not so.  Riding our ATVs through the back woods has exposed them to low hanging limbs and brush.  Even though they've been knocked out of alignment, they have not bent or suffered any damage whatsoever.  Very high quality components that I recommend without hesitation.
0,Driving the seal on without the tool  would have been very difficult.  Great Product and highly recommend purchase.  will save time in the long run.
0,Pricey as heck but works for mini and bmw
0,This stuff is GOLD!!! I've never used a Chemical Guys product that I did not like, however this far exceeded my expectations and is incredible. I even coated my chrome bumpers with it and wow to they shine!!! I highly recommend this product.
0,Just what I needed but plastic buckle to close the straps to hold the ladder in place broke when I loaded plywood over it. Replaced with velcro, which should be used in the first place
0,Battery tender...always a good product and a good price
0,What to say? Fit perfect! Love the look!!!
0,Looks and works great. Exact replacement fit for my haulmark cargo trailer.
0,This wire set is an exact replacement for my vehicle. Works great and I like the fact that they are marked for each cylinder can't mess it up. The blue color makes it stand out on my vehicle.
0,Installed as sold--easy and worked the first time. took 20 minutes.
0,Great quality you would expect from ford. Took about 12 min to swap out this part with the original. Unplug the wire connector, pull the mounting pin, reverse to install, done. c
0,OEM washer save me some money buying in bulk.
0,so far they are pretty awesome nice and bright they don't have a lot of flex to them though
0,This made the job of replacing my flywheel much easier.
0,great item
0,perfect...recommend
0,Very high quality product. Does keep the bikes dry while traveling. About the only complaint is that I have to wrap additional rope around the whole assembly or it flaps badly in the wind of driving. Zippers work fine and the straps that are there are adequate for the task. Would buy another if I needed to.
0,Versatile tool for those deep embedded, spinning; upper strut mounts. Just what was needed.
0,great
0,Great tools for a great price.  Just wish they came in a three pack!!  Definitely would buy again.
0,These tire gauges are built a lot heaver than the cheap Chinese crap I get at my local store. I bought 2 of these, and they do read about 1 -2 lbs. different from each other. I am so tired of checking tire pressure with 4 different tire gauges and getting 4 different readings. I have read the reviews on the digital tire gauges. Some say they are more accurate; some say they are junk. At least these are a better built gauge.
0,Awesome power! High quality and recommended to everyone!
0,Works as advertised.  Really easy to clean your filter.  I put my cleaned filter in front of a fan and it was dry in less than 15 minutes.  All in all, from start to finish, less than 30 minutes of easy work....most of it while holding a cold beer!
0,works
0,Arrived promptly and just as described.
0,Makes my truck look awesome.
0,GREAT bang for the buck!  I only wish the wheels were a bit softer like a roller blade wheel.  Otherwise, this is perfect.
0,Used to change oil in the lower unit of my Mercury outboard motor. Fair price and received on time.
0,Sooooo cool.  I decked my daughter's Jeep Wrangler out in Batman and she loved it.
0,I bought this air freshener from a local car audio place and i've never switched since that day, greatest air freshener ive ever had!
0,Very nice kit would highly recommend
0,Good quality material.  Folds practically flat when not in use.  Nice size and very usable. The included straps are a nice detail.
0,Did some minor rust body work on my grand-daughters 2000 Civic and the Duplicolor paint did a great job. I gave it four stars only because the paint texture was just slightly "rougher" than the original. But the color and metallic specks look great! For coming out of a spray can...I'm a happy camper!
0,mine has had a tough time and still a grate helmet. ill definitely buy another.
0,Good deal, easy fit
0,have just installed it on latest oil change, and its impossible to know if its more efficient than my past Fram filters, but the  look, feel, and weight appear high quality, and ratings are high for its performance, so hoping for the best
0,Great product for a good price.
0,Thank you very much its perfect  5 stars  good Crip see you again
0,works great!!!
0,Good design, good quality. It is possible to use as a mount for additional equipment on atv, not only for the mirror.
0,works gteat
0,Makes my key fob look like new
0,Great for keeping the lawn mower battery charged in the winter and a trickle charge for a Miata race car.
0,I little bit rusted, but they are doing their job
0,Bought this incase I broke the old one pulling it out, I didn't but I used the new one anyway
0,Works good in my 03  Yukon
0,Was worried when I opened the package and it was slightly different but it plugged in just like the old one!
0,perfect fit and performs great.
0,just what I needed and it arrived fast
0,Love the bumper, if you use anything bigger than 33in tires, you will have to get a spacer for the spare. Almost looks like a perfect match to my rugged ridge front bumper. Would buy again if I needed one
0,Gun lube.  Works great.  Bolt guns, gas guns, pistols, revolvers.  Think about the ratings API has put on this bottle and what your engine goes through from cold starts to red-light racing to towing trailers to mountain passes to Texas summer heat... this stuff will keep your CAR engine parts from self-destructing, works great on guns too.  A lifetime's worth of lube for what, ten bucks and change?  Next time your kid gets eye drops for pink eye, save the bottle for this, stick it in the handle or butt pad pack.  YMMV.
0,Love them
0,I have these maintainers on my equipment over winter that i am not using regularly. Cheaper them buying batteries year after year .
0,This unit was nicer than the Lexus one I pulled out. It looks like the filter hadn't been changed in years. On our 2008 Lexus RX350, the replacement couldn't be any easier. Two little tabs pull out and BOOM, there is the filter access. Only took me literally 3 minutes to change including opening the packaging.
0,I needed this master link and none of the local motorcycle shops had them in stock. Installing and flaring the rivets was no different than the DID chains I've used in the past. Chain and masterlink work great so far 4,000 miles later!
0,This OBD tool let me read a P0303 code at home on our 2012 Honda Odyssey.  This led me to the dealership that identified there is a service bulletin on the 3rd cylinder misfiring on these vehicles.  Honda warranties this work which saved me approximately $4,000 to fix the problem.
0,what I wanted
0,Looks great !
0,Amazing and soft grip
0,Great batteries, we replaced our old spotlight battery with this one and it has been working great!
0,I bought a set of these lights to replace the unreliable halogens I had on my ATV prior. I've been nothing but pleased with this investment. These lights are very bright, far outshining any other halogens I've ever used in this size, and draw almost no power. My favorite feature is how these lights are impact proof and completely sealed. I've had them under water even in some cases, through mud, swamps, etc, and never once have I had any issue with them not staying on or turning on when I need them. Completely reliable. These lights have proven themselves and made me a returning customer.
0,good Pad for the money.
0,I modified it heavily, but it worked.	It didn't have a light mount, I added that.
0,Great buy, thanks.
0,Works well.
0,Cool
0,For 4 cylinder models. used it on my 98 Camry. ratcheting wrench, ratchet, sockets, and prybar. The prybar was to align the holes.
0,Perfect replacement.
0,Easy install, look good.
0,Fit perfectly on my 2004 Dodge RAM 1500.  Good quality.  Seems to be as good as OEM.
0,great fit
0,Very bright bulbs. Excellent
0,Works great
0,Fits as it should. Price is right.
0,Great price, easy install. White In color.
0,I've been using Simichrome for 40 years and have never found anything better for the job.  There are more aggressive compounds, but for basic chrome detailing Simichrome is still what I reach for.
0,Fits and works for 1999 Jeep Wrangler 4.0L
0,Just as described. fit the car perfectly. good quality
0,Not a bad kit... a little cheaper looking than the ones  replaced BUT.. Considering these brake all the time and get damaged from weather I would recommend this product for its price verses quality. I would buy again.
0,Best price available for a true OEM part.. Thank you
0,very good
0,Did the job!  Like the built-in gauge,
0,Fits my KTM 350xcfw
0,Perfect fit and easy install...
0,Well made and sturdy
0,The the CAI on my Civic perfectly and very snug.  I also like not having to oil the filter like a K&N.
0,works great
0,Always great stuff from locktite
0,Had no issues winding back the pistons during my last brake job, cost effective tool that pays for itself with the first use
0,I purchase this item thru Amazon, but the order including this item was not arrive or consider lost andnmy money refunded. So i have to purchase it localy for my 2003 Mazda Tribute. After change from standard air filter, i can defenately feel the change instantly. Tourque and HP increase. MPG as well. Really high recommended.		Update: 19 May 2013	I just bough another one for my Ford Escape. But this Air Filter is not fit with my Ford Escape. In Amazon website, it says fitted with my Vehicle System. So I'm confused. Return it for refund.
0,It does what it says, repels dust surprisingly! I use this as recommended by many speakers and automotive enthusiasts to protect rubber and plastics from sun UV damage and what not. Surprisingly the dust does not accumulate which is my biggest OCD!
0,Great!
0,Perfect fit
0,lock is well made
0,Looks great
0,sprays right on. works for me
0,It's a tensioner pulley... Fit well and the squeak is gone and my 2003 Grand Marquis.  Happy with the purchase cost less than OEM
0,I wasn't experiencing any problems but I replaced the plugs anyways. Idle is very smooth and the install was very easy on my e46. Every 50k I do the plugs on my vehicles.
0,Works perfect. I am glad I bought it.
0,Great
0,What is there to say. This is my second switch that I have installed in my RZR and both work perfect,	Fits the in dash cutout	Lighted when on and off so it is easy to see in the dark	20 amp switch so it can handle the load without a relay	Custom logos	blue light matches that other dash lights
0,Great
0,These are wicked easy to install and look really nice on my black Wrangler. A phillips screwdriver and 10mins is all that is required. I've liked all of the Rugged Ridge Jeep accessories I've purchased. Definitely recommend.
0,only bad thing about this hose is that it does not compress like all the others
0,Fantastic bulbs!  Upgraded all the light fixtures in my 2015 Airstream Sport trailer for the cost of a couple new fixtures. I did not want to purchase replacement LED fixtures as they are not nearly as nice as those provided by Airstream, but they used incandescent bulbs. These LED bulbs are brighter, whiter, run much cooler and use much less electricity. With the old bulbs, with each additional light I turned on I could hear the inverter buzz louder.  With the LED bulbs, the inverter doesn't buzz even with them all on!	Great product, lightning fast delivery.
0,Quality product.  Fit correctly and was easy to install in replacement of a cracked PCV.
0,I have 2 of these. nice and compact.
0,excellent!
0,So far everything perfect.	Received it in 3 days Super fast Los Angeles	Install took me less than 20 min after reading the instructions pretty much disconnect the your oem light bold socket using a flat head screwdriver remover the light bold twisting it to the left then pull it out  be careful to not touch the glass if you do wipe it good after.	Connectors all plug and play  if don't turn on check the oem connector and connect to the opposite side.	Really bright and make a night drive way better.	Accord coupe 2015	The only bad thing is  now I need to buy all the others lights in white to match lol
0,Nice, Good Buy!
0,These are cheap made in China tires. But they do have a nice 500 wear tread pattern and mounted and balanced well so if you want to save some money on tires these are nice.	P.S. they do have a large lizzard mascot on the side walls.
0,Item was exactly as described.  It arrived as advertised and required less than 5 minutes to install both cables. Very Satisfied Customer!
0,I accidentally poured a few gallons of water-contaminated gas into an old car I have. I ran the fuel line into this funnel which was sitting in an empty gas can and let the fuel pump run. Just like it advertises, the water remains in the top of the funnel while the gas passes through...I got out about 16oz of water. Definitely worth the price but the name "Mr. Funnel" is a bit hokey.		Be careful putting in dry gas beforehand as the filter can't do much with water emulsified into gas.
0,Good construction. Installation instructions and bolts and hose supplied. The only thing I would suggest would be to turn the tank on end and check for filings inside. I didn't and after i had fuel in it I saw filings inside. Other than that i would recommend this tank to every one.
0,Looks great on both my vehicles!
0,quick delivery, works fine..
0,Excellent fit and perfect product. 1990 K1500
0,I use these for my Polaris UTVs and they are the best.  Have used for years and they are the best I have found.
0,Switches look good, and seem to be of quality build
0,great product / extremely happy with product...
0,Been using these for 10 yrs in my Subaru Forester. Never a failure and never any signs that dirt is getting through to the engine.
0,saved my hands in 40degree temps while rainaing
0,OEM fit and finish, not much else you can ask for, at a much lower price than the dealer wants for the same/similar filter. You cannot go wrong with MANN filters.
0,This is so simple, it works great
0,worked and fit perfectly just like the original
0,The best scent for an air freshner
0,Exact fit and new bling for the 4-Wheeler.
0,Pair it with a 3 inch pad and for quick hand polishing or even applying wax. No stress in my hand. Great product!
0,Easy to install. feels a bit cheap
0,Good tool, well made.
0,The picture is misleading.  The product covers all of the bars, the main roll bar, rear side bars (with or without a sound bar), and the bars that are above the front doors.  There is padding for all of the covers that must be attached before installation except the bars over the front doors.  The padding for those covers is already inside the material.  It would have been much simpler if they were all made that way.  I installed this product over a month ago.  I recommend reading the instructions fully and starting this product in a well lit garage or with 2 hours of sunlight and no wind.  I was able to do this in a little over two hours.  The cutouts for the soft top bar did not line up exactly, but it did fit.  2000 Jeep Wrangler SE.
0,Fits and doesn't leak.
0,perfect
0,Quality seems to be good, but did not fit my 2500 as others have said it would.
0,Much brighter and good pattern on road and down range. Great deal-couldn't pass this up!		UPDATE 11-16-2016.  One bulb went out after 13 months. Checked it and the housing or bulb itself is loose.  Bulb will come on with some jiggling, but won't stay on while installed/driving.  Not good anymore.  And just out of warranty by a month as well.  Trying some new Phillips bulbs next.  Good while they lasted but they were not heavily used in that 13 months compared to my other cars so I would have expected them to go a little longer than they did.
0,perfect fit no issues
0,Works awesome as a gasket tack adhesive.  Spray it on the gasket.  Let it dry, then stick the gasket where it belongs and it will usually stay put during installation.  I also use this on all head gasket installations.  Never had a leak.
0,Fit just like factory.
0,Fast delivery, just what I needed Thank you
0,Must have for any electrician. I work on industrial heavy equipment and use this kit daily. Quality Fluke product.
0,Solid helmet.  I have used many helmets in this price range.  I wear glasses and can really only use a modular helmet now.  I have tired Nolan, AGV, KBC and HJC in the past.  It's been about 12-15 years since I have had an HJC.  I ordered this on a saturday morning and had it sunday afternoon.  It fits my head well.  The release is very easy.  The venting is very effective.  Definitely the best airflow of the helmets I have owned.  I use ear plugs when I ride so can't really comment on quietness.  The only thing I would change is make the first stop on the face shield about half of what it is.  With my last helmet, I could ride with the visor at the first stop and it was the perfect amount of air while riding.  On this one, it's just a bit too much air while at speed so I have to keep it closed.  Not a big deal, but a preference for me.  Otherwise love the helmet and at this price can definitely replace it more frequently than I have.
0,as expected... good price
0,they are great
0,great for suvs
0,This larger size holds the remote for the TV, the tv soundbar and the satellite remote. The 2 sided tape holds it firmly on the wall under the TV. I put a small piece of sponge in with the remotes to keep the from bouncing around while the RV is in motion.
0,I bought an Ansco brand replacement for my Toyota's right side and it lasted just a few months and then fell apart in a rainstorm.		So, I was looking around Amazon for a replacement and saw these. The price was great and so is cause. I have two ladies in my life that are on breast cancer watch. So I bought a set of these. One 14" and one 22" for the drivers side.		They were a total breeze to install and work so well. I am amazed at how well they clean the windshield in the rain. Now we will see how they hold up to the Hawaii heat.		Common guys, show your support and get some pink wipers. They look great on my white Toyota. I am thinking of getting the matching seat covers and mats now! When I took my car in for an oil change everyone just looked at them and smiled.
0,One month in and LOVING it!  At the cost, I'm only wondering how long it will last.  The build quality is very good, very solid aluminum construction.  Two minor gripes (certainly wouldn't keep me from buying):  1) The wire lead to run the switch into the cab isn't long enough - needed to add about 3' to it. (2013 F-150 install). 2) To adjust the light requires 8 allen screws to be loosened/tightened in fairly limited spaces. 3) The switch is a bit cheap (but can be easily replaced).  All in all...a GREAT BUY.  Def would buy again.  UPDATE: 1/9/2017  6 months of use & still like new - shoines bright and no sign of aging or failure.
0,Takes a little work to self install, did it with out lift.  you need to cut front spoiler a bit.  installed on front of 2007 Dodge Ram 1500 4 x 4  for attaching a light use home snow plow.  It works great and easy to use, looks good too!
0,Works with Foxwell 510t
0,Works well,,,,,,,,, they hold my 60 pound SOT kayaks just fine and can be turned to the wall out of the way when not in use.		Had a bit of trouble with the install,, broke a couple of the plastic brackets..my bad,, not the product..make sure you hit a stud when you mount them and pilot drill a small hole for the extra long screws that come with the kit..		Two brackets to an order..		Great space saver, OK price and you can guess where they were made, but OK quality..
0,very simple to install on my 2015 toyo-taco.  looks great and VERY sturdy!!
0,Nothing special. Fits the stock fog lights and provide enough light on the road. Compared to stock, it is the exact same.
0,These are decent for the price, not to bright (compared to stock fog lights on wife's Highlander).  But they are better than nothing, they do a decent job of flooding the road with a soft yellow light which is what I wanted.  For being a smaller fog light they put out a decent amount of light. Gave it 4 stars as for the price and size they are good fog lights. I used the daystar rocker switch and with minimal modification it fit easily on my Volvo 850.
0,Bulbs work Great
0,Easy to install.  Well built.
0,not much to say
0,Great product and great quality.
0,Installed and looking good on my truck definitely worth buying
0,Of course as soon as I bought these we barely got a dusting of snow on the ground all last winter so I cannot comment on the traction. I can tell you these were very easy to install and fine adjust for my wife's SUV. I had them ready for her to use in less than 15 minutes of adjusting for all 4.
0,great price and worked very well
0,Works great. It took care of all my shift problems. I am pretty handy, but until now the most I had done to a Transmission was fluid and filter change, so just to be safe I searched YouTube and found some helpful videos to go along with the included directions.
0,As described
0,With a fair amount of trimming, this worked well to cover the cargo area of my 2010 Honda CR-V.
0,Ordered for my golf cart. They work great.
0,I had to remove and replace a bearing for a john deere transmission cover.  These worked well.  I liked the two sizes per disc which allows you to set the smaller end inside the bearing.  This keeps the pushing disc lined up.  As others have noted these are not very big, but if it has the size you need it should get the job done.  I used a small hand held sledge hammer to strike them, so you will need that too.
0,Awesome!!!
0,works great
0,If you have a dual axel camper and want stabilization, these are an absolute must. We have used BAL brand before and was pleased with our leveler, but these take the cake. Our camper has never been this stable. We do not travel without them. Highly recommend!
0,great for locking down my hitch
0,I have read that some of these units have had issues, however mine has worked flawlessly since it's arrival. I use it every day.
0,This is amazing! I bought the Mac Tools branded tester (ET74) but it is the same device (just different price). I have an older Corvette that has a parasitic drain that would cause my battery to go dead after 3-4 days. I used a multimeter and pulled fuses to find the first problem. With two fuses boxes it took over an hour. That was last Fall. Earlier this week I went through both fuse boxes in less than 15 minutes. It would have been faster if the pins on the test leads were about 1/2" longer. Still, I found another problem (lumbar adjustment on seat control panel). Swapped-out that panel on the seat and re-tested everything.		It was nice being able to quickly validate that there wasn't a problem by quickly re-checkng all fuses, instead of just assuming and only testing the one fuse for the circuit where I made the change. My battery doesn't go dead now and if there is ever a problem again I know that I will be able to find it quickly and easily. Well worth every dollar spent.
0,Great product works great fixed leaking trans
0,Good quality decal.
0,I replaced both reading lights and the dome light in my 2000 F-350  and the dome light in my BMW Z3 roadster with these.  They put out a very bright bluish-white lite that is brighter than the incandescent bulbs they replaced.  They can be a little difficult to fit because they are wider than the incandescent bulbs, I had to angle them a little in my truck's reading light socket and my BMW's dome light to get them to fit.		They are a couple millimeters longer than most "Festoon" bulbs and the end isn't as "pointy" which made them harder to snap in to the socket, so I took off one star.
0,Nice fit, had to modify lip where contacts intake manifold. Had a machine shop surface sections of the lip on valve cover. Other than that no leak, snug fit. Looks good. Used a thread locker on baffle screws. Ran motor till warm, let it cool, and re-torqued valve covers. Did this three times and sealed tight. Installation was on and 85 TPI 305 Camaro.
0,fit in perfect,but wife thought they where not as bright as the originals
0,These are some of the best Microfiber cloths I've used.
0,Great quality hose
0,Fit my 2017 frontier crew cab w/o any problem. Installed in 5 min and looks great. Love the quality of weathertech
0,Super fast shipping, have not used it yet, but looks like a great product.  Perfect for my recovery bag I keep in my atv.
0,Best locks
0,Perfect fit in my Ranger Trail trailer. Initial quality seems great. Only time will tell on the durability.
0,Works great! Using with Chemical Guys Super Heavy Duty Sprayers. Also works great on RV trailer framing/tires and truck step boards and bed liners.
0,Worked perfectly in the airbox of a 2001 F350 with 7.3
0,Perfect fit and takes two minutes to install. easy, cheap, quick fix to vacuum leak
0,Now this is a gasket! I seemed to get a regular gasket with all the other parts I bought and ended up with four that I'm not going to use but I think this one is worth it.
0,Despite Amazon (and other sites) saying they "dont work" on a Trailblazer EXT 4x4 - they do, just fine.		When paired with new Moog 8114 Coil Springs, it levels out the truck nicely!&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Moog-81114-Coil-Spring-Set/dp/B003YMHCO8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Moog 81114 Coil Spring Set</a>
0,PERFECT PIT
0,It works a little better than the Harley cleaner.
0,work out great
0,Only complaint is it should have 3 brushes instead of 2 brushes and a foam thing that does little good and makes the brush harder to use. Next time will look for one that is all brush. But this one does the job and is easier than using a rag to clean the lug nuts.
1,Absolutely horrible.  Snagged after first use and starts unraveling. Total waste.  Poor quality
1,NOT IMPRESSED
1,Poor o-ring sealing solution doesn't work properly and is very flimsy. No new mounting hardware and plug doesn't fit exactly right. Just a cheap knockoff.
1,I really like it, it is bright.		However I hadn't even had it six months with less than 2-3 hrs on it and the top left of the light bar has gone out.		There is no physical damage to the bar at all just seems that it is a manufactures defect. The reason I got LED was so that it would last much longer than the time it has.
1,I have an older BMW with basket weave rims. Anyone who owns them knows how notoriously difficult they are to clean. I figured I would give this product a try to see if it could save me the time I normally spend scrubbing between each crease to eliminate the brake residue on my wheels. Turns out it didn't save me any time and hardly worked at all.		The foaming action cleans the tire nicely, but it left all of the nooks and crannies in my wheels filled with brake residue. I tried reapplying and re-washing a few times on each wheel, but the truth is, there is no substitute to elbow grease.		After doing all four wheels I realized I had used nearly the entire bottle and they still weren't clean! I ended up just scrubbing and washing each wheel by hand. I find that kind of outrageous. Definitely will not purchase again. $10 down the drain with the dirty wash water.
1,I bought 3 packs for 3 different vehicles and all but 1 burnt out within 6 months. The last one met it's demise in a front-end collision.
1,The back of my Honda Odyssey Case fell off . The Front portion is nice and good. I got this one and tried to attach the back piece to the old one and it did not fit. I tried to remove the Front portion and just impossible. Took it to a nearby AutoZone and the employees tried it and could not do either. The product looks good but that does not mean it is useful		Their advice -- Take it to the dealer.
1,starting out I liked it but after installing it the compass wouldn't work right I took it out and reinstalled it and the compass still wouldn't work right so I put it back to original and amazingly the compass worked and I don't know why
1,didn't fit
1,I've attempted to jump a Subaru 4cyl and a 20hp John Deere engine with this and it's never successfully started  the engine.  Both instances,  I pulled out the old jumper cables and did things the old fashion way. Both batteries were pretty far gone,  but that's what I'd expect in any road side emergency situation.  I wouldn't feel comfortable relying solely on this device.  It hasn't proven itself at all effective.
1,Not loud at all, i had a single exit super 10 muffler and i always wanted to put somw dual exit on my rear end. I finally decided to get the dual exit with an economic dual cherrybomb muffler. I was expecting a louder or atleast the same sound. It was quieter than the super 10. I just didn't want to spend more money to get a dual super 10. I cant return it because it was soldered so i guess i have to stick with it
1,very difficult to toggle though menu each time, doesn't seem to work as well as analog chargers
1,These plugs are too small. Also, upon closer examination, adding these plugs would cause a drainage issue due to the hole going completely through the frame. Waste of money.
1,Leaves seats to sticky even after buffing
1,dont like universal plug
1,Never used it. Was meant to be part of overhead console.....BROKE before it ever worked.
1,All I have to say is junk will never buy again payed for my lesson on that
1,Does not work like other water blades.  Don't waste your money. Leaves streaks and does not remove surface water.  Just doesn't work well.  Too bad at the price.
1,I ordered because this product stated this would fit my car a 06 Nissan xterra.	Had high hopes because I trusted this would fit my car and it would look awesome .	Shame on me . Nope parts don't fit my car
1,Nope.		One of the T10s didn't work. Won't fit the door light housing without modifying it through filing it or drilling it. Won't fit the domes...about a 1/4" too long. I'm not sure how they're getting four stars. They barely fit the map lights, but I'm sending back. Fit issues on two out of three? No thanks. I'm not modifying my truck to fit an aftermarket bulb.
1,Hard to tell if it really works. May be good for cars that are just under the threshold of passing but it won't do miracles.  The product description is over rated.
1,Perfect fit for the 2nd table missing in my RV. Highly recommend.		Update 4/28/16 After getting to finally install these in my camper with the new table I'm very unhappy with the fit. Are made in China and are not as heavy weight and are not the same diameter as the originals. They measure 0.15 short of the required 2 1/4" which makes them a very sloppy fit so now the table is so wobbly that I'm going to have to figure some way to shim them up. I might try some aluminum tape they use to seal heat ducts.
1,great
1,Do not work properly
1,Complete garbage.  Used these to replace my factory actuators and these were not even strong enough to pull the lock assembly all the way.  I've been a mechanic for over 15 years and have installed hundreds of door lock kits.  I returned these and purchased a universal door lock kit instead.
1,Rear one bows in in the middle. Fronts good.
1,My radiator was smashed pretty flat in several places.  This tool was useless for my scenario.  I had to get out the credit card and work each fin one at a time.  Once I had the fins roughly straightened out, this tool became useful in keeping them uniform.  If you think you are going to straighten out sections that have been smashed flat, you are not going to like this product.
1,it just came with the insulators nothing else
1,Too stubby. Once locked in, depending on where your hitch is mounted, unlocking this can be quite cumbersome. Plus the end cap keeps falling off so dirt/debris is bound to get in there and mess up the locking mechanism.
1,A good concept, but hard to attach and then to get back off, and it's very easily bent.
1,Very difficult to get over 1" straps. No way they will fit over 1-1/2". They are super soft, however I wish they were designed to wrap around the strap with Velcro rather than slide over.
1,Product was wrinkled and wet.
1,Not even close to the right fit for my car
1,I put one on and it just blew off 4 months later.  The oem lasted 10 yrs  I will use oem next for this part
1,Crapie plastic. But you get what you pay for..
1,both remotes only work within a 5 to 10 ft radius of the vehicle which is cool to lock and unlock the doors but i have remote start and i have to be damn near right next to the car to activate it. POINTLESS.... bad product.
1,Didnt say DOT on the lense
1,Poorly made, some pieces were warped and 3m tape must have been put on by an amateur!!!! Returned item for refund.
1,Hard to apply wasted 50 bucks very angry, if you don't have a heat gun don't buy this.	the fact it didn't work for me doesn't necessarily means it won't work for you.
1,I tried using it and it seems it's nothing more than water in a spray bottle - they say it's a special solution but I didn't notice any improvement with affixing the tint. I ended up not using it and requesting a refund.
1,These have a very yellow color to them. I was expecting a much whiter look. Also they arived in a solid plastic case but they were bouncing around in the plastic case and one of the lights had a chip off of it.
1,Bought in October 2017...by January 2018 the rear hatch almost killed my wife because she was not expecting it to fall on her head!4 months old is unacceptable Total junk. The ones I replaced were just weak and at least held up the rear hatch. Back to strong arm for oem performance! owned 7 jeeps and first time I didn't use strongarm and paid for it.
1,Does not sit flush on my 2010 HD 48 sportster as advertised.  Couldn't screw it down all the way and so about 1/8 sat above the tank.
1,Can't even read jet size
1,Find something else. I am disappointed with this pressure gauge. The digital readout works but it will often require 2 or 3 attempts to get a solid reading. The 'voice' portion gave an incoherent croak the first time and has not worked since. I tries a fresh battery to no avail. I had one of those cheap round red ones for well over a decade until I dropped it one too may times. Now they seem to be out-of-stock everywhere.
1,Disassembled gauges to put in glowshift pillar pod and they jump back and forth will have figure out something else to put in
1,Just opened the box and it was torn around the seam. Made of  Cheap material. Can't return because of Amazon return policy.
1,dude blow out first time using it
1,arrived leaking
1,All I know this does NOT work with a 2003 FORD FOCUS with Blaupunkt MP3/cd Dual din Stereo.. still looking for the right one!!!
1,This is a prime example of planned obsolescence.  The problem is that on a safety related item there is no excuse.  I refuse to pay for this entire linkage when only the plastic attachment to the wiper motor is bad.		Check out Dorman #49447 for just the plastic bushing for $3-5.
1,I thought this would be a good gag "exhaust whistle" but it isn't.  To get any whistle from it, it has to almost completely fill the pipe.  I don't like the idea of doing that, even if it is all the way at the exit end of the exhaust system.  It's pretty small too, works in Hyster LP forklift tiny exhaust, but nothing else within "joking" range.  If this is extra large, I can't imagine what size one for a 2 1/4 or above exhaust tubing would be labelled.
1,This will not run my 60-80w fridge that peaks at 120w	I tried this out it works good for small loads like my laptop using 15w peak but my mini fridge not even close and it peaked at 120w runs 60-80w.	I thought maybe it's the lighter plug so I cut the wires and ran it to my battery directly still didn't work and the fault light comes on when my fridge kicks on
1,MOST vehicles can be tested KOEO (key on, engine off - memory codes) with an analog voltmeter and counting needle sweeps, or looking at the CHECK ENGINE light and counting flashes.		Just because a code reader gives you a "32" doesn't mean you have a bad part relating to that number. An EGR valve stuck open from carbon on an older EEC-IV Ford will give an EVP sensor out of range (its not fully extended). A kinked MAP sensor hose will give odd problems and false readings. A generic TFI (ignition module) will have your car running like crap with no end to repair bills in sight (until you get a Motorcraft TFI again!).		This item is by no means a "magic wand". I had a chance to use one at a friends house...his hesitation problem was nothing but old spark plugs (platinum plugs are junk: get copper core; AC Delco or Motorcraft). This reader (AS ANY READER) will ONLY get codes STORED in your ECU, or "hard faults" in a KOEO test. Manufacturers used to make the processors "dumb" so they wouldn't store a code if the error only happened a few times - I feel they are doing it again.		If this is the "Lincoln" of all testers, it should come with a BETTER way to hook it to a PC - like an USB port.		I do like that it comes in a case...a small sheath would just hold the broken parts inside when it would be dropped.		I rate it 2 stars only because the retail price is ridiculous. The product itself is a 3.5 or so.
1,Gun boot itself is good but sleeve inside the boot is terrible iron sights  on muzzleloader wore through the sleeve after being on a couple of hours of riding atv. The bracket stinks vibrates and loosens nuts that attach boot to bracket.
1,I purchased this because I bought a different adapter from another vendor, but it was considerably larger and I wanted something that would not be accidentally kicked when plugged in. However, after trying this one with all of my vehicles, it did not even request a pairing code, so Torque (Pro) would not connect to adapter. Since the larger adapter works flawlessly, I decided to just buy an extension cable with an elbow and return this.
1,rust city
1,I purchased two of these, but once it was in my car glove compartment in the cold temperatures (30 degrees F)  it would not turn on.  This was the case for both gauges I purchased.  Once they warmed up inside it worked fine.  If you live in cold temperatures (Chicago for me), this unit is not useful.  Otherwise, seems like good quality and I love the rubber cover for good grip and the connection to the valve stem is solid.  Too bad it could not handle the cold temperature.
1,very cheap. you get what you pay for though...
1,This is a below average quality brush, but will do the job.  Over 100 hairs fell out during the first use.  Fortunately the wind and my fingers picked them off my roof.  This brush will loose hairs- just be aware of this before spending your cash.
1,The drum was not properly turned (rounded) and caused a knocking sound in my drum brakes.  I put on another drum and the problem immediately went away.  Sure I could fix it and have it turned, but for the price, it's definitely not worth it!
1,cheap metal put on tried to turn and the wrench started to bend wow thats why it's a bleeder wrench watch your knuckles
1,The wiper arm fits my 2016 Mazda 3 just fine but it smears the glass like the one that I took off that was a year old. I am going to order a different brand, very disappointed in Trico blades, they used to be a good brand. If you don't have one and someone gives you this one, it will stop the wiper arm from scratching the glass while you order another brand but other than that, I wouldn't use it.
1,Does not stand up. Poorly Made. Keep Falling.
1,Why does the pop up says 1500 watts and the order says 1000 watts ?
1,**Update** After awhile riding with this bag, it's too the point where it's useless now. One good ride in the rain and it's form is gone, it's become super flimsy, flopping around in the wind, the leather straps won't tighten enough to keep it up so I substituted some plastic brackets (inside) and tie straps...paint on the buckles is already wearing off, and so on. I've only had this a few months. Looking at the other reviews, maybe I got a funky one? Bummer this much money wasted.
1,Well, you get what you pay for. These are advertised to fit standard 7/8 inch bars but need modification. The expanding nut is too small and won't hold (had to get new ones), bar clamps would not get tight enough to hold, the blue plastic is not very big and does not provide much protection from bushes and such and they just are not very strong (1st time I dropped the bike the guard bent so much that I couldn't even pull the clutch lever).
1,I thought it would be mild steel like a brake line or normal fuel line. This material is too stiff to work with easily.
1,Somewhat short on seat but fit right up back. Nice quality but just short on seat & cannot hook under seat.
1,It is ok for a winch cover, but will fade and deteriorate very quickly in the elements.  Would not recommend,
1,Broke after a week of use. Returned.
1,Does not work.  Washed car.  Clay bar.  Did not remove swirls either by hand or with polisher.
1,Love Gorilla items and had high expectations.  These do not properly fit and secure the factory 20" wheels.  The lug nut seat is to narrow for the lug hole		Quite disappointed.
1,The battery in my little handheld vacum cleaner slowly lost its mojo, It would not accept a charge and was just worn out. A quick Google search turned up this replacement battery in a slightly larger capacity of 1.4Ah as compared to the OEM's 1.3Ah.		The size was identical to the OEM battery. I installed it, charged it and my little vacum cleaner started working again.		Unfortunately the battery soon fizzeld out and now will not even fully charge. My handhelp vacum will operate for about 30 seconds before slowing down and stopping. So for the price, it lasted about 2 months and is now useless.		Lesson learned. No more cheap replacement batteries for me.
1,Went through the hassle of trying to upgrade a 2004 Chrysler T&C Mini van with these.  Bought the resistor packs and everything, but still couldn't stop the quick flashing fault indicator and they were less bright than a Halogen bulb.  Can't recommend them for this vehicle.  Threw them away as a waste of money.
1,Tiny, these are for a kid.  What a waste of money. wasted money on the lenses too.  now in the trash
1,103ci Harley, failed for db at 96.3  with the baffles it was 94db. That's still above my states limits. Save your money
1,Crappy
1,i haite it
1,I can get readings and some of the extended readings seemed useful.  The online stuff is not much use for me.  The PC link usefulness is lost on me... where-what?  Tried it on six different cars and have had link problems for half.  General codes are fine, however, I could have done as well with a cheaper unit.  I think Live-Data is what I should have looked for and this was not the one.		It is way not as useful as a DRB3 would be... few things are.		UPDATE: I recent got some ABS issues that prompted me try and check the error... I was not able to read the ABS... this is the 3100 non - ABS version... I paid I thought for the one as advertised.  I was a sucker.  Be warned, double check what you get.  It may look the same, but will not do the same!
1,Nice outfit well priced but gets serious indentations every time they are used which limits their life span.
1,I own several of these and the first time I buy one from an online dealer, it doesn't work. Charger shows green all the time (fully charged) even on dead battery and will not charge at all. Trying to send back, but already installed and used the other pieces it came with on other vehicles.
1,The Fuel Filter on the ram takes a 28mm-not a 29mm. Poor advertising
1,When I received this, I almost returned it. It is sturdy but EXTREMELY tiny. I'm not certain that it is useful. I did check the dimensions prior to ordering, but was not expecting this. Decided to keep it and use it in one of the cars that doesn't accumulate much trash. I will update the rating if I find it to be more useful. Adding a small trash liner to it was easy and will keep it looking nice.
1,Differ in the degree of color and there is a jerk in one of them
1,Looks just like factory looks great to replace my faded lock and unlock buttons.  Here is the problem, my key fob stopped working after installing into this body.  I put it back in my old shell and it worked and tried alternating using new buttons with old shell, old back with new front shell and the only way it worked was when I put my old shell with faded buttons back together.  I'm not saying this will happen to you because I have replaced these in other vehicles in the past and they worked great.  The problem seems to be the battery connecting properly.
1,Product was defective check engine light came back on after replacing the old one. After spending $300.00 trouble shooting the problem with no results. Went to an automotive repair shop spent $200.00 more just to find out this part was defective, they put in an old EGR valve car now runs great no check eng. Light. Worst experience I ever had from Amazon. Warranty expired lost $95.00. Total cost $595.00.	Should have been $95.00!
1,This filter DID NOT fit my 2009 Hyundai Elantra Touring. It was too large. I had to cut it to fit.
1,these lights started flickering after a month a big waste of money I had these lights a few yrs ago and they worked fine,, guess they are made with cheaper parts now
1,Not proportionate just looks weird and a cheap knockoff
1,nice but  the magnets are weak
1,No instructions on this IR item either. Is that a company policy to let the user guess how you use the product? I suppose you have to press the valve at the bottom to remove the water. At least they do have arrows showing the in and out. There are also a lock and unlock symbol but  no idea what that is for. I may change my rating after using the product for a while.		UPDATE: After calling technical support I was able to decipher that the bottom half unscrews so as to empty the moisture. That's what the lock and unlock symbol are for. the valve at the bottom is to relieve pressure.
1,fitted it to my 2000 Jeep wrangler 4.0 and it made the engine run far to cold, when I removed the stat and checked it, it was seized in open position from new. Threw it away as to expensive to ship it back. Ordered the 180 stat and checked it before fitment, this was seized in closed position but after exercising it a few times it started working, now engine runs at correct temp.
1,Simply would not work with my 2004 Volvo s60r. Would just power on, connect with bluetooth, then no app I tried (including paid Torque) could get vehicle information. I would look else where unless you have a vehicle that someone else has already stated works with it.
1,It's nice to see that gear setup that the parts store has where they compare regular oil to oil with Lucas additive in it. After doing research I found out its a lie. You can add many things into your oil that would give it a sticky property but you affect the ability of your oil to lubricate the engine as designed. If you want to really protect your engine just use good oil and wait a minute after start up to let the oil work it's way to the top of the engine. Most wear on the engine is in the first 30 seconds to a minute. This is because most of the oil works it's way down to the oil pan. If you have a turbo do the same but in addition when parking let car idle for 2 minutes to cool off turbo. This prevents oil that is inside the passages of the turbo from burning which becomes carbon, creating a turbo failure in the future.
1,Great stuff  but way too expensive
1,Ordered 2! Neither worked. Still looking for a good replacement.
1,cheap injection molded plastic.  I'd be amazed if it doesn't break in the first year.
1,First time I tried to use it it snapped while inserting into the grease fitting. Really thin metal and not strong enough.
1,Started peeling after about 1 year.  Looked great while it lasted.  I DO NOT recommend this product.
1,The product arrived with cosmetic damage, looks like it was dropped and paint peeled off.
1,Cheaply made it broke off my engine
1,not very bright. find another brand
1,2 problems with this product	1. the optional spacer (blue circle in picture) is whole, not split.  To use it, you need to split it with a knife.	2. the clamps shipped with my kit were not like the ones in the picture.  I have replaced numerous CV joint boots and have never seen the type of clamp mine had (see picture I attached).  The only way I found to get the clamp to hold, was to use a screwdriver to hold the joint piece, then pull the end with a pair of pliers and then bend it back on itself, like other clamps.  The problem is that this clamp has no tabs to lock the end in place.  And the clamp itself is quite thin for the application.		In general, the boot installed like it should.  The small end did not securely lock into the recess in the axle because I could not get the clamp tight enough.  I expect that it will quickly slide back from the recess.  However, it still should protect the CV joint better than what I had before, which was a missing boot.		A few years ago, there seemed to be more brands of split boot on the market.  Now I could only find Dorman with a split boot.  If I was to use another Dorman product, I would buy better clamps.
1,I had several places on my car that had scratches so I thought I would order this product to see how it worked.		The application of this product was easy once I found a YouTube video on how to apply it.  The instructions were not well-written.  However, the results of using this are just OK.  It does not blend in seamlessly with the rest of the paint job, it sticks out.  I am guessing, however, that applying this will give the car more protection than leaving the scratches bare.		I would most likely not buy this product again.
1,I bought this for a 12V AGM battery that supplies a 300W inverter that supposedly can produce 600W for brief periods, as well as some low-current 12V accessories (USB chargers, etc.) The first time I used it, with a ~50W load on the inverter, the circuit breaker tripped and wouldn't reset, even when disconnected from the battery and load.  Unfortunately, I didn't fully test it until a few months after I bought it, so I can't get my money back.
1,They sent the wrong battery for my 2001 kawasaki 250ex the terminal is on backwards and it's to small I can't even use it because it's wrong way and won't fit the wires that way the box it's self can in very beat up and old looking
1,Broke  too many fittings trying to take off. This what happens when you go cheap
1,they go in and hold just fine, but try to remove them and they break and fall apart.
1,No good! used it once to see how well it works, I was impressed. a week later actually needed it and the only thing this will do is blow fuses. Fill-Rite has always been my go to pump for Diesel transfer, I have them mounted in on board transfer tanks on our trucks so I made the assumption this would perform similarly. Not so much. buy local at least then you can take it in and exchange it. Lets see how the warranty is help up.
1,Awful, this tire bead sealer has the consistency of water. Do not buy! It got one star, only because it won't let you give it none.
1,Fell apart after being on for 3 hours.
1,I thought Bestop was the way to go but might have been wrong.  When I received the product I was excited to get it installed.  I had the hard top removed from my Jeep and stuck in storage and had a blank canvas ready to put on my new soft top.  The packaging was great, looked as though it was packaged at Bestop and not opened.  Everything was wrapped or in plastic sleeves to prevent damage.  First step was installing the door surrounds - about 5 minutes in and found I had missing parts.  I had 2 passenger side door surrounds instead of one set for each side.  At this point I could no longer install the top but continued to work on the prep items that could be done.  Found I was also missing foam strips that seal the front of the top around the windshield.  I also noticed deep hazing or marring across 2 of the windows despite being covered in paper inside the packaging.  With all the missing parts my Jeep had to spend the weekend in the garage and I had to drive my other vehicle.  I am extremely disappointed in the turnout but can't imagine how much more upset I would be if I didn't have a garage or second vehicle.		I think once I have all the parts to finish the install the top will be nice but beware you may not receive all the correct parts up front.  I will be reaching out to Bestop and hoping to get quick resolution on parts.
1,I purchased two of these tailgate locks.  It fit my 2006 Chevy 2500 truck tailgate, but not my sons 2007 GMC Sierra 1500.  The tailgate would not close when the lock was placed on the 2007 GMC Sierra 1500.  The clearance is slightly more on my 2006 Chevy tailgate so I guess this is the difference.
1,I installed this to my VW Jetta and it was whistling at high RPM.  I can hear the TXV whistle from inside the car so my AC does not cool.  I had to pay an AC mechanic to replace it with a real TXV, which fixed my problem.  For DIY'ers, look elsewhere as it will cost you money to replace this.
1,DID NOT FIT
1,rust after 2 months 3 blocks from ocean
1,They fit very well and where comfortable. But when tried on there was a hole in the finger where the stitching was done. Material is fairly thin also.
1,Plastic tops, not like oem rubber. My gas tank key hole was stuck, when I put key in and turned hard, felt like the plastic top was going to break off.
1,I've been using a Slime pressure guage for the past year. Little did I know that this guage reads over 11 lbs less than what's in the tire! Extremely inaccurate guage- save your money.
1,Junk, JUnk, JUNk & more JUNK is all I'll say.		They fog up, slide around in the helmet and are cheaply made. Recommend buying a better made product for a few dollars more.
1,The swivel head moves too easily actually making it harder to get a seal on valve stem.	The hold pressure reading until you release it worked for about two weeks.	Was nice feature when it worked but now that it doesn't its just annoying as all hell.	Update. Tested this against several other gauges and it reads high.	I then smashed it with my 12 lb sledge hammer to avoid damaging any tires.	RIP
1,Absolute junk. The adapter does not fully seat to depress the valve, thus it doesnt read the pressure for my 2003 Envoy. The pro is that they took it right back & promptly refunded my money back.
1,UPDATE: After 2 tanks of gas, lost 4 MPG from 24 to 20. I will be attempting to return. Future updates coming.		ORIGINAL POST: 2" diameter pipe, STOCK PIPE IS 2 1/4"!!!	My wife's HHR is not a hot rod, it is a 2.4 liter LT automatic model.	I installed a K&N intake and it would do about a 20 foot burnout....... Not anymore!!!	I installed this midpipe and the result is a HUGE TORQUE AND HORSEPOWER LOSS WITH THIS PIPE!!!!!!!	Basically eliminated all of the gains I got out of the intake and then some.....	It was a clean and easy install with liquid wrench the day before.... Everything lined up fine, just disappointed with how the vehicle runs now.	Oh well, I should have bought the high performance one for the additional $100...... too late now, and we will sell this car in the next year.......
1,did not last long.  I threw it away when I was gassing up yesterday.
1,Works well but not for a 2016 Sabura XV Crosstrek. These bulbs had to much resistant that it blew my fuse which was on the same board as the starter switch so it wouldn't let me start my car. I had to spend $600 to get it to the dealership to have them find the issue.		The brake light for the Subaru is a 7443CK so I don't think this is.		SO BE WARNED!!		I will be returning this for a refund.
1,Great little battery tender for a very low price.		Update: I have bought 4 of these and 2 of them have failed......so far, including the one I just got.
1,you gotta be kiddin me...
1,i had given this 5 starts before?  because it wired in to my bike so nice....  but when i actually tried using it,,  i found it had been assembled incorrectly from the factory...  thankfully i did not attempt to jumper from one bike to another..  i had hooked up my smart charger to charge the battery this winter..  my smart charger told me something is not right?  so i thought i had made the mistake of wiring this into my bike incorrectly..  i disassembled my bike once again.. found everything to be correct.... sooo..  i disassembled the wire plugins only to find the wire on one end assembled correctly,,, the other end was the opposite,, assemble incorrectly.  so ,, if you know anything about 12 volt grounding,, check the wire ends before you use this to make sure the jumper wires are assembled the same...  if not,, you could blow up your batteries,  or do major damage to your bikes electrical systems?  .
1,Horrible, they don't light up anything. Returned them almost as soon as I bought them.
1,Did not work with my vehicle as stated it would.
1,This thermostat did not open until it got to 209. It caused my oil temp to shoot up to 225. That is way to hot for a Texas summer. I returned it and bought the Motorcraft stock one.
1,This thing is way off, doesn't even come close to fitting properly in the area between the door and dash where the cb itself mounts. I had to take a grinder and cut off over a quarter inch of metal from this bracket, barely leaving anything for the cb bracket to mount to, and it still doesn't fit correctly. Save your money and just get something else or make something based off of this design.
1,I truly did not note. Any benefit of purchasing and using this product.
1,I bought both left and right control arms. On both of them the longer bushing that mounts with 2 bolts was pressed in at 45 degrees instead of  135 degrees. I did try to rotate it around but it was not budging. Also the rubber boot on the lower ball joint was scuffed and not seated smooth on one and the other had a small tear. Set both back for refunds.
1,Hard to secure to car. Straps don't feel secure
1,They all started flickering on and off after being installed for about 2 weeks in two different Vehicles dashes for the cluster lights
1,Horrible, while ,YES, you do get ehat you pay for , and this is one of those. They flicker, the mounts suck, and they have serious EMI/RFI interference..should just save your money and buy KC daylighters or good quality ones.
1,Returned, does not fit 2006 Dodge Ram 2500 instrument cluster
1,Came with missing bulbs..
1,Very poor quality, no recommended.
1,The gauge has color codes and tries to make it easier for the user, assuming the user doesn't know much about tire measurements. But I find it's hard to read due to the colors, and it has readings in mm and standard even though in my opinion most tire wear is measured in standard units (i.e. n/32ths).		It is not as precise looking as my Milton gauge and I would likely pass on this one the next time. The fact that it has 2 units of measurements depending on which side you look at makes it hard for me to find the reading I want (in 32ths which is what I prefer). Generally new tires start at around 10/32 and by the time they get to 2/32 you need to change them. No need for color codes to determine that!
1,Did not work and didn't come with directions. Found programming directions online and still didn't work.  Probably the wrong ones but no number to call. Must be a cheap Chinese deal.
1,I gave it an extra star because it looked like it might work and the manifold assembly seemed solid. I'm returning it without using it, so I can't say if it actually does. Here's why:	Seller sent wrong shipping info (tracking # & dates). I had to contact them to find out. Then it took nine days to arrive, very poor.	Website description stated 5 ft hoses but they are only 4 ft. Threads in hoses were burred and wouldn't attach to the gauge without de-burring first. As some others have said, the hoses look cheap and do not inspire me with confidence that they are safe, however I did not test them.	Website description stated an included ACME adapter however there wasn't one. ($10 item if you need it).	Instruction booklet is vague and did not mention closing the center valve (yellow hose port) during pressure testing procedure.
1,It's not a great design. The footpad slips off unless you put the lace velcro on....and I ride with shoes that don't have laces.
1,I bought this thing to use on my Mercedes a few months ago.  Last week I was going to test it for the first time but of course didn't which was a mistake.  Tried to use it and I can't get the pump handle to go all the way down.  The leaflet says to pump 10 times but with all 200 lbs of my weight on the handle I can't as there is a tremendous pressure felt.  The best I could get was maybe oil in the tube 10 inches above the oil pan.  I even bypassed the extract valve with tubing and could feel suction on tube going into the reservoir from the pump but nothing or very slight suction on the tube going into the oil pan.  Called technical support and about all they could tell me was how it was suppose to work and I would have to return it to the vendor. I'm glad I didn't pay full price.
1,Complete junk. Would not work at all. DO NOT BUY THIS. waste of time. Not worth 2 cents. 1 star is more than what this deserves.
1,The price is right, and it kept me dry. One major issue I have though is why does the jacket fit so easily over a bulky leather jacket, but I can't get the pants on and off without taking off my boots? You can't exactly pull over and throw it on real quick if the need arises. Also, its got a lot of loose threads. It works well, but I don't know how long its gonna stay together. EDIT: My second time using this suit I got soaked. I don't see how so much water could have leaked into my crotch, but this is ridiculous. VERY CHEAPLY MADE.
1,I have tried two tubes on model train bolts (2 mm tiny) and the next day it's still not set. I shake the tube, the bolt is clean. I used to get results years ago but the newer product refuses to cure
1,I am not sure if this is the same quality filter as oem or not. I bought and installed this to my 02 softail. When I took the old one out and compare it with this new one side by side, I could see my old one had more springs etc for the bypass valve. This is a cheaply made filter. I do like the good deals as much as anyone else but next time I ll get a different brand. Just doesn't worth taking the risk for only a few dollars  in my opinion.
1,very low quality fabric
1,Rated at 2500 watts however was unable to even hook to truck battery which was reading 14.2 watts.  Error code and audible alarm sounded indicating that the unit was being over charged with the truck simply running without even adding the intended load for which the unit was purchased.
1,I couldn't connect to most radio stations where I live at and after a few months the plugin for the ear pieces that goes in the helmet snapped off.
1,did not fit my jeep
1,I researched this quite a bit before I decided on this one - and I have to say, the reviews that talk about how problematic the key/ lock set up is are spot on.  Its a shame and very awkward how they decided to sell this as it is - its not always easy to lock securely and even new, the lock assembly just seems vague and almost worn out - I can only imagine how it'd be after years of frequent use and/ or being out in the elements.	I do like that it shares the same key for the hitch and trailer lock, and since this was one of the only ones available of this type to offer this, I decided to try it.  It wasn't expensive and decided to just keep it well lubricated until I'd see a better solution.
1,Let me first say, that normally I am happy with Dorman products.  This is definitely an exception.  I suppose that it is possible that it may be an exact match with some vehicles, but I can assure you that it does NOT fit (nor look the same) as the OEM mirrors on my 1993 Ford F250.  The attachment points (where it would bolt onto the door itself) are not the same layout as OEM, however due to the aluminum construction you could bend it to fit somewhat I assume.		Also, the arm itself can only be positioned in 3 ways (45 degrees in, straight out, or 45 degrees forward), where the OEM version can be moved to any position.  All & all, this is a much lower quality than I have come to expect from Amazon & Dorman, but I did pick it up very cheap & I will keep it as one of those "just in case" spare parts that I will probably never use.		Buy a different brand.  This one is not worth wasting your money on.		Woodstockva
1,See photos below - the first one is from the top where the airflow goes into the fuel injector, and you can see actual tatters where it's as thin as tissue paper.	Second photo shows blue sky showing through! I've never in my life (as a lifelong Fram customer) seen such terrible, disgusting product quality.	There's literally nothing at all preventing dirt from entering the delicate fuel system here. Definitely time for a brand change!
1,Didn't fit my BMW despite the checking I did to confirm. The threads seem to line up perfectly, but when I tried to install it, the fit seem to be too tight and I was afraid it would strip the oil pan fitting. It sits unused in a drawer...
1,We bought this for my wife to use on my VTX 1800 C however she ended up not liking it at all she complained it made her sit up to high and the cushioning was not soft enough as compared to my factory seat which is way more narrow we really hoped that this would work but we are sending it back and looking into other alternatives such as Airhawk since I already have an airhawk r for myself already love it.  Also everyone that we ride with said that it didn't look safe the only time my wife complained about not feeling safe was when we hit a dip in the road and her butt and the butty buddy lifted up off of the factory seat seat that's when we pulled over and took it off and put it in a bag.
1,I recently installed these H10/9145 bulbs in my 2015 F350 truck. They didnot work. Contacted the dealer. Two days to respond via email !!! He said to reverse the plugs and if they work, to just tape them on. ?????????????  I was not pleased with his answer!!!! I reversed the plugs and they did work. So I contacted him again to see if they had the wires were reversed by mistake and told him that taping was not a good answer because it is -10C here and taping will not hold the plugs together  nor this was  not a good suggestion from a dealer that wants to sell items like these !!!!! The connectors did not hold together after only 4 days in the truck !!!! He said the bulbs are correct for all North American vehicles that use these bulbs. I responded to say that my previous 2007 F150 wiring was identical to my newer F350 for the fog lights. He had no answer, so I guess the wiring is wrong and expressed that I was not very happy with his answers or the service, other than they sent a prepaid return slip to return the bulbs, of which I did !!!!!
1,Past when they will take it back.  It fits but has been randomly thowing a gas cap light and now a got a P0455 error.  It is the cap so not worth it....  Wasted money.....
1,These didn't work on my car. So then I returned them. Then they sent it back saying it had to be in a box. I sent it in a fully padded package that no way they would have broke in. They now sit in my drawer and the company gets to keep the money. All's well that ends well.
1,No where near what they look like in the pictures
1,Terrible, would not connect to my phone.
1,I'm very unhappy with this product because I have two brand new deep cycle batteries and I'm powering a little mini refrigerator that uses 90 watts total and about 150 watts to start it up. And I charge my cell phone and I run a small light once and a while I've tried everything even returned batteries and got new ones and the low power beep just got worse it is so irritating because I know the batteries are fine but not according to the unit I've hocked a volt meater up and I see the batteries are fine so this is junk it's unless for a very simple application of two batteries and a small mini refrigerator and a small lamp and cell phone being charged it's ridiculous I'll never buy this again !
1,Damaged my BMW. Really, really, bad flow rate. Supposed to be a "great" filter but it is to restrictive. Causes engine oil to choke.
1,My Rv came with the Furrion kit on it so installing the camera was a snap. I have a 34 foot RV with metal side and this camera has a hard time staying connected to the monitor when going down the road. It loses contact constantly. I contacted Furrion and they said there was nothing I could do about it. So I returned it.
1,This light is barely average and light output compared to other LED lights.  I also have the truck light model 7 inch LED light which puts out a much brighter beam at over twice the distance. I'll stick with the truck light. I returned this
1,Good quality just a tad bit short on the sides so doesn't cover the whole window on my ford f150. The reason I bought it was to keep the uv light out but the light still comes in, three stars.
1,Probably would work good but didn't come with key to unlock.
1,These didn't work as brake lights, as they don't get brighter when you step on the brake pedal. They also caused fuses to blow and caused other electrical problems. Do not buy these.
1,It worked OK for a while, but when three items were placed inside of it- the plug in heated up FAST. To the point it was too hot to touch. So this was sent to the great trash can in the sky before it caught my vehicle on fire.
1,Installed by professional mechanic. Started engine, and one channel promptly shredded off. Put old belt back on, went to PepBoys for a Dayco product at 25% lower cost. Goodyear or Amazon owes me $39.00 labor. Goodyear didn't respond to my complaint to them.
1,I'm not sure if I had the wrong size, but I did not have good luck with this half helmet. The fit seemed okay until I went over 25 mph on my scooter and it shifted back on my head. It wasn't comfortable or safe at all. I returned it and opted for a 3/4 helmet that I love. Plus, I realized how convenient it is to have a shield that you can bring down when it drizzles, which this one doesn't have.
1,100% completely worthless!  Dont waste your $, this is the second can Ive tried , and both times the everything leaked out of the tube at the nozzle. Im very Dosapointed! Will never again purchase these, I did exactly as the instructions on the can said. Get more bang for your buck if you use your bills to blow your nose. Pay more & get something that will do the job.
1,Amazingly bright, but already have a leak and getting condensation in one or the lights. Also really easily scratched.
1,does not fit 2001 sienna
1,Worked great for the 550 miles it functioned properly. Stranded in another state after this garbage failed. Cheap junk would not recommend. Wish I could send the seller my tow bill and price to fix it. Ruined vacation due to this cheap part!!!!
1,never even noticed the harley symbol on it, could have done without that,  especially since i have a honda and that is like the packers and bears to some people.
1,I want to state that I really like Hella products.  However, I am VERY disappointed with these lamps.		I realize these are compacts, however the reflector fails to put the light where it needs to be.  It more or less scatters the light all over the place almost like a flood.		I think I'm going to try a set of Hella projector style next time if size is an issue for me.
1,Said New OEM ... . USED PARTS..  USED PARTS .
1,Very poor reception
1,The screws come loose while riding
1,This was supposed to fit my 2006 BMW 330i spark plugs.  It does not, and I was past the return window by the time I was able to perform the plug/coil maintenance.  Not real happy.  Luckily I was able to use a deep socket that I already had.  At least it wasn't too expensive.
1,not polarized, gray part isn't tinted enough. Basically useless
1,The price was low so I went with this for a removable mount. The tabs that keep this hooked to the floor are cheap and bend, since then its very difficult to get them into place.		I would look for other options.
1,These things are waaaay over priced for some plastic.
1,LED is not very bright at all. Purchased to replace a previous H4 LED, and this item works fine (No flicker at low RPM) but it's not simply not bright enough to replace a standard halogen. The H4 I was attempting to replace was the same wattage as well and did not have flicker issues either, but this one is simply not bright enough.		Spend a little more or look elsewhere for a better quality LED bulb.
1,They fit a 2004 Mazda 3. But it idled rough and had a random misfire. Went back to original coils and solved the issue
1,Pump sux losing prime and dispenses minimum amount
1,Both hoses had a flat spot in them that I was unable to make round again
1,I don't think much of the design of the holder.
1,Only fair.  NOT very durable and do NOT fully secure the trailer.  Spend the extra $$$ and get the X-Block and / or the Fastaway (we now use both, Fastway for intiial set and the x block for final lock in)
1,Never really worked for me.  First few it had enough chartge to start my lawn tractor but after month or two it stopped holding charge.  I tried to return it and found out that I can not return it either.
1,Wrong size for mazda b2300.
1,For what this costs you would think there would be some white in the can. I cannot believe any company would sell a product this bogus as there is hardly any actual paint in the can. This used to be a quality product and a good value but not anymore. Dupli-color has reduced the actual white paint in the can by more than 50%.
1,Does not stick even after properly prepping the surface...
1,Don't waste your money didn't do anything
1,they are not as loud as they should be but they are louder then stock horns so they will have to do  for now
1,Purchased in Dec 2015 and 1 of the bulbs failed in Apr 2016 so I cannot recommend  an LED bulb that doesn't hold up. The bulbs are very bright and work well with the stock reflectors on a 2011 Acura MDX.  If reliability wasn't an issue I'd give them 5 starts but as is they are not worth it.
