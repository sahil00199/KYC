0,Easy buy
0,Buying organic is hard when there are so many cereals out there with cartoon characters, trying to lure our children in. Thankfully, it doesn't take a bee on the box to get my kids to eat this. In my humble opinion, I believe it tastes better than regular honey nut cheerios, but perhaps that's because I know it's organic :)
0,my husband loves this soup - it's his favorite.  the only place I find it is on Amazon
0,A+
0,I love it!
0,quick shipping, great item!!!
0,Have used in the dishwasher several times and it worked great. No more water marks on the glassware.
0,This size for this price is wonderful! Love having it around. Great buy.
0,I keep these around my home for guests as well as my kids. The cost is super too.
0,Anchovies seem to be harder and harder to find these days, and canned by fewer companies.  Overall flavor was there, and these were a little less salt, but a little more oily than most other brands I frequently use.
0,Great for those who need a quick bite when on the go.  I really like the flavors.
0,Good assortment
0,works well
0,Favorite snack, as described!
0,It doesn't remove makeup as well as I would like but leaves your skin nice snd smooth, doesn't really dry my face out.
0,good stuff
0,Great tasting cereal. Always crunchy.
0,tastes great right out of the box. I like the fact that it has plain chex mixed in .Its sweet but not too sweet.
0,A year's supply of pancake mix.
0,Thank you
0,Excellent tasting beverage I'm a diabetic and this is perfect for me, no sugar but a great taste, it's way better then diet sodas, and it's highly recommended by physicians for diabetics, diet sodas foo, the body and still mess up your insulin levels. This beverage does not do that, and it tastes great, I highly recommend
0,Delicious~
0,Tasty
0,These are perfect for stuffed shells - both Italian stuffed shells and Mexican stuffed shells.  I would highly recommend.
0,You pay a little more at the grocery for Newman's products but they are well worth the extra cost. We can't recall when any of the grocery stores in our area had this product on sale. The dressing is very good and we could not ask for a better dressing for our salad. We love to change the dressings around once in a  while from our regular dressings and this balsamic vinegarette was one we changed to for that difference. Great product which we all love. And we know that profits go to charity. This is a winner for everyone using Newman's products.
0,I'm always craving these, but I can only find them at a convenience store.  These are a better deal.
0,Great product, I recommend to everyone that needs this!
0,Not sure my rosacea is agreeing with this product
0,Good deodorant. Does the job!
0,I've always loved eating Frosted Flakes, so it's one of my guilty pleasures, but I bought this mainly for my teenager. Just as tasty and decadent as I remember from decades ago. This is a larger box than I expected, so a nice plus.
0,Always a great buy!
0,Great Deal

0,delicious!
0,great taste and you can taste the strawberry flavor.  Very sweet but this container makes it nice to adjust the amount.
0,To me it's really bland like most of their soups.  I find myself adding garlic, oregano, Italian Seasoning, etc. and doctoring it to my taste.  Lots of pasta and stuff in it and otherwise good.
0,These are the best, tried another brand, won't make that mistake again! Why can't you order these from Prime for the same price as pantry? That really ticks me off!
0,Holds up to cold cream cheese and lots of fixings
0,This is great soup...  highly recommend/
0,Yummy and all gone, get some
0,great item

0,Excellent and affordable cleaner
0,this is a good 2nd choice.  An authentic New England Clam Chowder is not possible for me but this really satisfied my hunger for some about as well as I could ask.  Really loaded with clams and the potatoes and creamy broth/sauce hits the spot on a chilly, raw winter evening.  Food for the body and food for the soul.
0,You can't go wrong with Dial.  I've been using it for probably 50 years!!! Was even recommended by my doctor for washing before surgery! I will always buy this soap!
0,Gotta love good ole sleepytime tea!  A classic minty flavor that is great for winding down.
0,Awesome taste! Best peanut butter product available on the market. It doesn't just have a trace of peanut butter...it is peanut butter. Anyone who truly loves peanut butter will love this product.
0,It's a very good soup, but a little less flavorful due to the lack of salt. Made better with the addition of some herbs
0,I love that these are available in prime pantry! Kids love them as an after school snack!
0,I use these all the time to make soup ahead, portion, and freeze for my lunches. Like most plastic, they are brittle when frozen, but usually it is only the rim that cracks if you happen to drop them while frozen. After many cycles in the microwave and dishwasher they are unstained and still tight fitting.
0,Great product. Good price. With Prime shipping, and subscribe and save, and Prime Pantry memberships. Everything pays for itself in one shipment. So many packs. Great take with you anywhere snack.
0,Love it again its a great little snack.
0,Nice
0,I love this protein, there's a bit of a grainy texture, but that doesn't bother me.
0,exactly what it was supposed to be wonderful
0,choosy moms choose JIF.....lol Always loved this peanut butter....Good value!!!
0,My kids love crackers, but they are so messy!  These are the perfect little squares that greatly reduce crumb trails and piles.

0,I used to be a barista and this is the stuff we used to make our chai drinks, along with the vanilla version.  The vanilla was also too sweet for me, but this variety is just right!  Sweet, but not too much.  Full flavor, all the spices and delicious bits.  No bitter sting of TOO much spice, either, like I find in other chais.  (it won't clear your sinuses like Starbucks, that's for sure!)  I am so happy to find it in a big enough canister to make purchasing it economic!
0,Great for on the go nutrition! Keeps me going at work.
0,Classic elbows that cook right every time.
0,The seasoning is a 2 part process but totally worth it. I love this popcorn.
0,The Eatsmart snacks are a new favorite of mine.  When you want something just a little salty but don't want to indulge in a bag of potato chips, these are a good alternative - and you're getting more veggies!!
0,This stuff is amazing.  You can use it as a 1:1 for flour in any recipe, and the texture and taste is great.
0,tasty
0,works great
0,I received these as a free sample from BzzAgent and Tide. I am writing and unpaid unbias review. I'm generally opposed to pods as their bright colors and whimsical designs get the attention of children. I have seen first hand what once of these can do to a tiny body. That being said, Tide has done away with the fun colors and whimsical fun here. This is a pure white pod. I truly appreciate this. I have a little one with extremely sensitive skin. These pods did not cause any skin irritation when washing her clothes! Yay! I will say it was very convenient to just throw a pod in the machine with the clothes and be done! No measuring and no soapy mess! The pods completely dissolved and left no messy residue. I use an HE washer so it uses less water than the standard washing machine.  The clothes washed up just as nicely as using the liquid Tide.
0,My favorite cookie
0,THIS IS THE DRINKING WATER AT OUR HOUSE.  WE BUY NO OTHER BRAND.
0,Great product
0,Kids love them and it was a super fast delivery!
0,I make a frozen shake with this and sometimes add strawberry , banana, and pineapple for a treat.  Nice way to take care of a sweet tooth. As long as you don't go overboard/
0,This is really good oatmeal for  a low sugar type...I am trying to watch my son's sugars and this is great because he loves Oatmeal so he can still have what he likes with less sugar. Thanks for carrying this product highly recommend A+++
0,These are my go to breath freshener. A must have for any vehicle.
0,Works well.
0,Good cereal.  Not too sweet.  Just right
0,both my mother and my brother are on prescription medications that prohibit user o standard OTC remedies. I have had good luck with hoemopathic remedies (Hyland and Boiron i particular) and thought this might be a natural option. A lightly flavored syrup, it is palatable and easy going down. It does soothe sore and irritated throats and quelled my mother's cough. Additionally it cleared my brother's nasal congestion. the down side is that the dosage should be taken every two hours. It does not interact with medication and it is effective. Made in France, the expiration date on my bottle is 07/2018. this is a great option for people whose choices are limited by prescriptions or for those seeking a gentle, more natural remedy.
0,this is a wonderful water enhancer. i wish i would have found this sooner. i will def buy it again.
0,The Planters NUTtrition mix is so tasty that I find myself always wanting more. The dried cinnamon apple pieces are the bomb. They taste like apple pie - whoever came up with this mix needs to sell it in bulk so I can buy more than one can at a time. I highly recommend this mix, but be careful of overeating it.
0,love it does the job nice smell
0,Nice product at a good price.
0,Good
0,Couldn't find these anywhere. Great!
0,I like this herbal tea best of all the ones I've tried.  It has lots of taste, and a nice color.
0,This is tasty cereal that kids enjoy and even I didn't mind eating. Like that it's organic and all natural.
0,Love this stuff.
0,So yummy and good for you too. A great snack after a work out or anytime you need some protein.
0,Great gravy for breakfast just make sure you add sausage. This makes enough for about six people two biscuits  each
0,I picked up a box of these, and the cali lemons. These peanut butter cremes were FAR superior to the lemon. Had them mostly with coffee, and found them to be top-notch.
0,excellent
0,The scent of this liquid soap by Mrs. Meyer's is wonderful and citrus-like. The addition of aloe and glycerin helps this soap feel very soft and gentle. The bottle and pump works very well and the brand label comes off clean if pulled apart, so you can use it afterwards to fill with other things should you want to re-use it. Very elegant and functional overall.
0,Great for heavy flow days. The price was a bargain at the time of purchase. I will be buying again from Amazon Pantry.
0,yum yum
0,love the smell!
0,Love it.  Great deal and great product.
0,strong coffee but great flavor
0,Our dog loves Nutrish. Price comparable to Wal-Mart.
0,This a great fresh tasting salsa and really is chunky. I think it tastes the best after it has chilled in the fridge.  I love the size and the easy to grip handle.  I add it in my chilli, on grilled chicken, eggs, almost anything.  Also I can not do hot spicy and the mild really is mild but with lots of flavor.  I will be ordering this brand again and again.
0,Good as advertized
0,Perfect, love being able to keep back up in the pantry. Didn't taste exactly like the refrigerator types but came in handy when I ran out.
0,Amazing value from Amazon so always stock up, this is my favorite flavor from Slim Fast. I have one in the morning with a protein bar and the same for lunch and have a meal in the evening.
0,Good, wish it was more fruity and less flavoring.
0,I am diabetic and it is nice to have a product that I can use in baking that will be good for me.  It works well on oatmeal too.
0,tasty, just the right consistency.  and healthy as far as sweets go.
0,Very good.
0,Delicious.
0,This is the cats meow in our home! Both of our cats love this pate variety, and they eat every single bite.
0,Just what I ordered, black pepper corns for daily pepper use in grinder.  They're good but there isn't a reason to "love it"...can't imagine what would be that reason for pepper corns?
0,As expected,  convenient to have delivered
0,Next time when you're at the pharmacy check the price of the brand name Cetirizine. These Good Sense tablets work perfectly, their price is amazing, this is one of the best buys I've found on Amazon. A quick note, my cat has severe allergies (seasonal) and he is able is take only this allergy medicine (either name brand or these) crush with his favorite vitamin gel. Vet approved (my vet), no more dripping nose or itchy eyes.

0,Almost impossible to find this version in the stores which does not have aspartame - (which kills brain cells among other detrimental effects.)		Fiber is so vitally important to keeping us cleaned out, diluting the toxins we're all exposed to, for weight control, and to act as a prebiotic in our gut, which by the way is our second brain, and can play a key role in mood.		As far as I'm concerned this is the gold standard in the fiber world (aside from eating fibrous vegetables and beans etc). Sometimes for whatever reason it's hard to get enough fiber, either due to dieting, illness, travel, or just the rush lifestyle that many have, so this is a great addition.		I find the best way to take it is a couple doses of a couple teaspoons spread out during the day. Be careful not to overdo when you start because it can backfire and ''bind you up'' if you take too much too soon! Happened to me once years ago, no fun.		Start out gradually, with a teaspoon or two, and drink plenty of water with it.
0,Perfect as a college student.  They sell these for 1.25 a pack at the vending machine in my school so I appreciate being able to avoid as many angles of robbery my school it attempting.  Breakfast is important!
0,The children like it
0,These are extremely light and crispy with a pleasing salty coating. I wasn't sure what to expect with these but I was pleasantly surprised by the taste and crispness. They're much better than regular wheat thins. I'm glad I purchased a bag to try out.		These may not be robust enough to hold guacamole or regular sour cream-based dips but are the perfect accompaniment for hummus or with soups. And they're delicious just out of the bag.		Recommend.
0,I love this stuff.. you can smell the tea tree in it.. which to me is a positive since to me that smells natural.
0,I pride myself being a from scratch, slow cooking all natural etc. But these are really good. Add a little nutmeg, garlic powder and parm cheese and  its awesome.
0,Good as usual. I like this brand.
0,Yummy.  Will order again.
0,Works well and less hassell
0,Out of all the flavors the International Coffee by Maxwell House has to offer, I love this one the best. You don't need to add more teaspoons of the coffee or anything else because the flavor is perfect.
0,cleans great
0,My dog liked this food. I had no issues at all.
0,Great
0,They are paper towels. They are good paper towels. They do a good job being paper towels. If you're looking for paper towels that do what paper towels are supposed to do, these are a good choice.		Would not recommend using these as bath towels, wash rags, or hair towels.
0,This was just for refills. I have been using this product for several years. I like it, but they are expensive!
0,This rinse is a must have in the DW.
0,Needed to stock my motorhome.  This was a perfect size when you don't want leftovers.
0,Hard to give it five stars when Amazon calls that "love it".  It's a sponge, for cryin' out loud, not some great food dish or innovative gadget.
0,Well, everyone knows Colgate so it really needs no review.  Just buy because this is such a good deal...that's all.  Bye.
0,exactly as described. good value. as a hackathon organizer i order tons of this stuff for our events. it's very easy/convenient, delivered and way cheaper than having caterers provide it.
0,Just like the bag in your local supermarket! Tasty crunchy salty-good restaurant quality tortilla chips ;) Amazon even packages these so you get no breakage when they deliver them to your home! Love it! It feels like nacho night!
0,Awesome product... We love buying off of amazon prime.
0,love them

0,If you are suffering with menopause symptoms you need this product in your life. If taken every day no symptoms. No more hot flashes, no more night sweats, no cranky old woman hiding inside me. Love this product. Best stuff on the Market.
0,As expected
0,Great value and great size for a larger family.
0,This is the same size box you will find in the store which normally is smaller than the regular flavored Cheez-it's, so don't be alarmed by the other reviews. It is also the same great flavor as the ones in the store.		These come at a good price in Prime Pantry and my whole family loves them, so this is a standard purchase for me.
0,great
0,Soft, comfortable, does what it is supposed to...

0,These are my favorite crackers at the moment...all flavors (minus the pecan)! :) The cream ranch and the cheddar are particularly yummy! I'm pleased with the nutritional information and the serving size, as well.
0,Descent taste, a little high on salt, but over all great!
0,I absolutely love this wild cherry vanilla Pepsi. I have not seen it in the stores for quite some here so happy to see it here on Amazon. My husband even took one to work and all his friends wanted to know where be bought it, because they like it also and have not seen it in stores around here, so now it keeps running out on Amazon because people are finding out where they can get some!
0,This is wonderful, especially if you have a permanent retainer. ( those who have one know what I'm talking about) no more threading floss through. But even if you don't have a permanent retainer it is great and easy way to floss.
0,Arrived quickly, packaged well.  They stick very well. Great size. flexible
0,Just the right size for a snack
0,love Lindt candies -- great for gifts!!
0,I am a big fan of Happy Belly nuts and mixes, having tried virtually every variety available. This sixteen-ounce bag of roasted and salted mixed nuts is excellent, as expected, and easy to recommend.  It's a very straightforward mix of peanuts, almonds, cashews, brazil nuts, hazelnuts, and pecans, and it is certainly comparable to a name brand mix such as Planter's.  Apart from the nuts and sea salt, the only other ingredient listed is vegetable oil.  According to the packaging, these nuts come from Brazil, India, Mexico, Vietnam, and the United States.		Obviously, the bulk of the mix is peanuts, which is no surprise as that is the case is every mixed nut assortment I have ever seen.  While no percentages are acknowledged on the package itself, the online information about this product confirms that the mix is about 50% peanuts, followed by 20% almonds, 13% cashews, and then 8% or less of the more exotic brazil nuts, hazelnuts and pecans.  While I did not count out my nuts individually, based on my exploration of the bag I would say that these percentages appear to be accurate.		Having enjoyed Happy Belly almonds and cashews on their own, I can say that the same quality nuts are found in this mix.  The peanuts are your basic roasted, salted variety, as good as any other brand out there.  I am not a huge fan of brazil nuts (and thus fine with the small number found in this sixteen-ounce bag), but even those tasted good to me in this not-too-salty blend.  There were very, very few pecans in my bag, so keep that in mind if that's your favorite nut.  All in all, I found this to be a fine mix for snacking or entertaining.  Recommended.
0,very good
0,I love these packages of trail mix. They're easy to throw into a hiking backpack or keep in my desk drawer at work. These bags are resealable, which is great!
0,Yummy !
0,I love Caramels anyway, so this was a very good purchase.
0,Purchased for storage.
0,These do cost more money then the regular dusters but its worth it because when you are dusting you don't have to stop to flip over the duster to get the under side of whatever you are cleaning because the duster goes all the way around.
0,This is a wonderful, cheaper alternative to buying Claritin. It does the same thing at a way better price!
0,good clumpting.
0,There were a lot more whole cashews in the can than I expected, which is a plus.  If you like cashews, you will like this product.
0,Always good. Pole caught!
0,Good
0,Great value and top notch product.
0,All clean, no harsh chemicals. Great for sensitive skin.
0,all good
0,Can't go wrong with Band-aid brand!
0,my family loves these chips, healthier than most as well
0,I love the fragrance and this body wash leaves my skin feeling clean and soft...and since I have terribly dry skin I must be careful about the body wash I use as I can end up with tough, dry, flaky skin..but no worries with this one.
0,I definitely prefer this Scott Extra Soft Double Roll Bath Tissue over the regular Scott brand. That stuff is like newspaper. We have a septic system, so the toilet paper selection becomes quite limited. This is pretty decent. As I stated, it's definitely softer than the original Scott toilet paper. It does come apart easily, but I think that is due to it's ability to break down easily for the septic system. So it's kind of a compromise. You may go through a little more, but you get more comfort. I'm sticking with this.		Although I frequently do reviews on products offered to me at a promotional price, this was a personal purchase. I was not asked, nor am I obligated to give a review.
1,I tried cooking with this because i have heard how good it is for you, however i couldn't eat my cooked meal because it was so oily tasting, i just couldn't bring myself to eat it. I know it is healthy but i don't know how people do it.
1,These smell awful!  They do not have a fresh, natural smell - they smell of chemicals.  And the scent lingers for a long time.  These are the lemongrass scent - which I thought would have a mild, fresh scent.  Horrible!
1,Not the best "solid white", very fishy and rather unpleasant!
1,Wouldn't order again
1,I have used this for over 40 years off and on and I could not have been more disappointed. It was so compacted in the bottom, I would assume from age?, I couldn't even break it up. Ugh! It lacked the flavor of good, fairly fresh sesame seeds and was just disheartening in every way. I do not plan on purchasing any more. Perhaps leaning on Brand recognition has lowered their quality control?
1,I ordered these as a gift for my sister she said they were really little and terribly stale and hard her son called the manufacture
1,Received all cans dented, we're dented BEFORE shipping since the box wasn't dented or other contents disrupted.
1,I'm used to angel soft. These are really rough feeling compared to angel soft
1,contains genetically modified substances and palm oil.  I didn't eat it.
1,It is not invisible solid, all my clothes looks white after using it and even when I washed them still white.
1,Note much flavor..
1,Not very flavorful
1,I guess the other person's review was dead on. But the cheapness of the deal on these gluten-free bars got the better of me.		They're not necessarily bad, but they are worlds away from the normal whole wheat versions. We have been buying those for years and really think they are about the best bars out there. Soft, chewy and filled with flavor.		Unfortunately these are dry and just not the same. Now maybe this is what most gluten-free versions of foods taste like (I bought this on price, not grains choice). If that is the case, then these may be fine. But if you are used to the regular bars, I would avoid.
1,They are a bit dry. Very hard. And not a whole lot of flavor.  Personally,  I did not like them.
1,This is not very good for anyone	A Organic cereal isn't all bad for you , huh?pumpkin and flax seeds pack 5 g of fiber and 6 g of protein as well as 450 mg of omega-3 fatty acids per -cup serving. But think about this it at 260 calories, 10 g of fat (1.6 g saturated), and 10 g of sugar, it's far from the best choice to start your day!
1,The consistency is just not good.  I won't buy this again, no matter how lazy a cook I want to be.
1,Also crunched!!!
1,I wanted these for a healthier snack but I don't like them at all. The flavor isn't too bad but the texture is terrible. I know they aren't claiming to be gummies but that was closer to my expectation for the texture. I was disappointed.
1,When the box arrived, half of the cookies were crumbs.  When I touched the other cookies, they crumbled.  The crumbs tasted stale and were flavorless.  Very gross.  Don't buy.
1,Really sad !
1,Smashed product not happy.....
1,I would describe the flavor as watered-down orange water with sugar.  I have tried other flavors that I liked better.		I wanted something to quench my thirst and replenish nutrients after exercise and games, but this is full of high-fructose corn syrup.  It contains "water, high fructose corn syrup, less than 0.5% of: ______".  I didn't find it to be nutritious nor helpful after exercise. I have stopped drinking it.
1,I did not see any difference in my hair at all.
1,Probably the worst scent from Method brand. It just is so overpowering. Very floral.
1,Purchased for daughter in college who reported these were bland and poor in texture. She recommends Veggie Straws brand because of their good seasoning and crunch.
1,good
1,contains palm oil.  a disputed unethical ingredient.  Also an allergen.  I'm sorry i bought this, i didn't eat it.
1,These seem to always have a problem. First it was cookies arriving after or very near the experartion date. Now they are poorly formed, crumbly and broken. I give up!
1,worst pop tarts I have ever tried. I threw the entire package away after just one bite.
1,Heavy and not much flavor.
1,Didn't taste right.
1,Great tasting chips but wayyyyyy to expensive for the amount you get. Arrived in good condition, No broken up or crushed as stated in other reviews. Will not purchase again due to cost.
1,they looked old or they  got hot...
1,Not for mr, tastes awful
1,Only after I got it I understood how bad this drink is. I don't recommend it
1,Good
1,i don't get the hype
1,great deal
1,Very expensive. Better than potato chips but still not that great for you. Did not receive damaged or crushed
1,tasted like chillie
1,This coffee is terrible.  It has a very chemical smell to it and the taste is just awful.  Unfortunately we just through it out.
1,Although they were edible, we did not like these at all. I'd stick to canned, refrigerated, or fresh fruit.
1,I like potato chips--too much. I have always loved these potato chips in particular.  But this bag must have gotten a triple salting, because it was so salty as to be inedible.
1,Don't like the wet mopping pads.  Very drippy, time-consuming applying on swiffer wet mop. Will not buy again.
1,not so good
1,this product will never be in my shopping kart again
1,I was very unhappy with the taste of this soup.  I do like Campbell's soup and enjoy several varieties of their products.  However the slow kettle baked potato soup will not come home with me ever again.
1,Prefer original
1,I do not like the taste.
1,my son did not like or eat these. ended up being a waste of money. im not sure if it was a consistency thing or a lack of flavor
1,I didn.t care for this.
1,Taste is not good
1,Too expensive
1,Disappointed. Weird texture and flavor
1,This made my scalp very dry and itchy.
1,I know I like coffee on the milder side but this was disappointing because it was better even in made weak.  Perhaps that is to the liking of the people who buy it regularly?
1,Not quite sure why others like this.  I bought it due to the good reviews.  It did not taste good.
1,NOT NEAR AS GOOD AS CAMBELLS
1,easy open tabs are easy tear off as well. Stick with the originals.
1,taste like crap. I've yet to find a sugar free alternative that doesn't have a bad after taste.
1,Nope.  Not that great.
1,this had an aftertaste, and I will not be buying it again.
1,Like the other Kraft cheese/potato mixes, this is not good at ALL. Too much salt, too expensive for what it is. Buy your own slices of cheese or some cheese powder, slice up some potatoes, add some salt/pepper/paprika/milk. Much better taste, just as easy, and better for you!
1,Looks like grits ... tasted awful
1,Only a few cookies were intact. Most were broken.
1,I typically love the Smartfood brand but these were disappointing. I didn't notice that they weren't the regular type when I purchased it but I decided to give it a try anyway. The sea salt flavor was the only one I could stand. The white cheddar was a mute flavor but it left a weird aftertaste. On top of that, several bags were STALE! I was highly disappointed and I'll never purchase this type again. I'll be sticking to the the white cheddar in the black bag from now on.
1,Small ones too!
1,I wanted to like these, but they're not that great. The sauce tastes weird and varies with each cup: Some have no garlic taste while others have too  much fakey-garlic flavor. The pasta doesn't cook well and stays hard after three minutes, so it's best to cook  it for 4 and a half minutes. The sauce is really runny and it makes oily stains on tablecloths or clothes if it drips. It smells bad too! My house smelled like the sauce for a day before an open window and an air purifier cleared it out. What a shame.
1,As far as purified tap water, these are fine (although I do prefer the cleaner taste of spring water). But I bought these since it's a perfect small size for kids lunches and the advertised print on the labels at the time I purchased (in AUGUST!) was sports/balls etc... but instead they shipped me the ugly Halloween edition, which we don't even celebrate. So now I just rip the nasty labels off.
1,Don't like the caramel flavoring.
1,I was excited to try a new flavor of the Luden's drops, as I really like the cherry kind.  But these just tasted.... gross.  I couldn't even finish the whole drop without spitting it out.  I will stick to the cherry ones from now on.
1,I love the size of this 8-pack of Pepsi but it's unavailable on Amazon now and I'm getting really annoyed that Amazon Pantry offers items and then stops offering them.
1,Very chalky taste. Beware of drinking it on the go you'll need to chew gum after. I didn't like it, but I hate waste food. So I added it to fruit smoothies. Vanilla Nutriment or French Vanilla Special K tastes better.
1,ok
1,Smells nice, but feels so heavy and thick
1,Turns out we like our caffeine more than we thought.
1,Imagine warm melon of any kind.  then make it fakey.  It's a cross between a standard pop tart experience and microwaved jolly ranchers.		VILE
1,cookies arrived like crumbs
1,low in flavo
1,Very clumpy, makes my lashes stick together, messy to have to try and brush it out. I tried cleaning the brush and starting with nothing on it, same result, so it wasn't a case of too much on the brush. I didn't care for this mascara at all.
1,This was awful
1,I love Fiji. It's normally great water and I'll continue to buy it from retailers, but not online. My Fiji water shipment contained water that seemed old like it sat around in a warehouse for a while. I'd return it but it's just too much of a hassle (and my wife angrily dumped all the bad water and recycled the bottles). Maybe people don't order this too often and we got an old batch, but I won't buy it through Amazon again, not at least this size.
1,These do not taste like any fruit or substitute. Every color tastes exactly the same. They have become a dog treat.
1,I like regular Tom's toothpaste, but have a problem with mint burning my tongue so I thought I would try this even though I am long past being in the target age bracket.  This definitely didn't burn my tongue.  The strawberry flavor isn't very strong, easily tolerable. Unfortunately, I find this product is too thin so it easily splatters everywhere when using an electric toothbrush.  Even worse though is the fine grit it leaves in your mouth. I used it for 10 days hoping I would get used to it, but I now give up.  I am going back to my old toothpaste and deal with the burn until I find something else.
1,Not impressed. Much better organic cider vinegars out there for less$
1,My cats were not so thrilled with this food.
1,Box open
1,I ordered some candy on Amazon to hide from my husband for Easter.... of course he found before Easter, but aside from that, the sour patch kids were all melted together. And no, it was not because of where I hid it. 1) where I hid it was well air conditioned and cool 2) he found within a couple of days so it's not like it was there for long. Little disappointed and when this product was bought elsewhere, it was pretty good! One of his favorite candies.
1,Bags are perforated at the bottoms, and then at the flap tie alternatively. When you need to tear one off at the flap tie, you might as well get a pair of scissors and cut it, they are so hard to pull apart. And the bag material itself is like old shopping bags that are about to fall apart. Cheap roll of bags, but don't over stuff them.
1,I like the Crisco just happy I don't have to carry it home from the stores some days.  I don't fry I use it in oill salads and when im out of butter.
1,HAD TO USE HALF OF THE BOTTLE TO GET A FLAVOR
1,Do NOT order these thinking someone will pack them in ice in the warm months. I ordered some in MARCH and they came completely melted. Like packs of water only HOT. I immediately put them in the freezer. Big mistake. It only helped to make the individual wrappers really stick. It was impossible to unwrap them :((( you will never understand how disappointing this is until you reach menopause!!!
1,Wasn't a fan of this. It didn't do anything more than the regular tide
1,I won't lie, these were pretty terrible. I'm not quite how you can take something that has such great components, and have it taste so terrible. Additionally, it doesn't really stick all together, so it isn't really a granola-bar but more like granola-ish. I don't know really what to do with the 4 more in the box...
1,Every single tablet I've opened is broken. It doesn't make any difference for purposes of washing dishes, but it's messy on my counter and when I put it in the dishwasher. Works great for the dishes but is too messy pre-use. I will go back to plastic tablets.
1,Smashed, don't buy with ANYTHING heavy.
1,These were quite stale and not as flavorful as I had hoped.
1,What happened to the nexxus of the 80s & 90s? This isn't the same shampoo. Leaves my hair so tangled and dry. Awful. And Im stuck with a huge bottle.
1,These bars literally taste like chewy cardboard. I do not recommend. They also give me very bad heartburn. Will not be purchasing again.
1,Very tasty!
1,Not my favorite brand. I just don't like the shape.
1,THE IS NOT THE PRODUCT THAT I RECEIVED IN THE MAIL. SUPER DISAPPOINTED
1,taste like saw dust
1,It makes a nice attempt at masking odors, but otherwise it doesn't remove the smells from the husband's work clothes. I'm really sick and tired of paying through the nose for laundry products that don't get our clothes clean.
1,This product stinks to high heaven!  It does not have a lemon grass scent.  It is disgusting. I sprayed my sink, and it lingered for about 30 minutes.  Yuck!
1,Way better than the cappuccino flavor. I'm drinking these attempting to lose weight. I've now been through five or six weeks worth of Slim Fast and protein shakes, have been exercising ( doubled my normal workouts) careful of everything I eat, walking a mile or more every day....haven't lost a pound. I'm kinda p.o.'d about it. Probably won't continue with this product, and will find another way to take the weight off. I only need to drop 20 lbs. but with a bad thyroid I'm guessing I'm gonna have to get drastic.
1,"Ketchup with vegetable chunks" is what we called this. Mild = mild apparently! LOL
1,Unfortunately for me, this shake is just too over the top sweet. There's no way I could drink an entire can of this without feeling a bit ill. I did manage to use it over the course of a couple of days by cutting the sweetness with coffee which worked pretty well either hot or cold. I don't know if I would buy this again. I'm going to reserve judgement until I try the other flavors. I hope there's at least one that I like because I have type 2 diabetes and I hate breakfast and this would be a great meal replacement that wouldn't make my blood glucose spike.		I have one more can of this to use and maybe it'll grow on me but I doubt it. I just don't have much of a sweet tooth so this seems pretty syrupy to me.		Bottom line: Just plain I give this 2 stars. If you drink it as a coffee additive and put it over ice (or hot but iced is better to me) then I would raise the stars to 3.
1,The bottom of the Quaker Oats was open at the bottom of boxes. Some of the oatmeal spelled in the box.
1,Very bland dry in some places hard. (stale?) I usually heat my tortillas in a pan before loading. These were gummy and tasteless. I can't think of a way to heat these before filling so I'll probably never buy again. Good concept easy to fill. Just not very tasty to me.
1,Its suppose to be low sodium. It still tastes pretty salty to me. I tried the one without any salts and that one was better.
1,really disappointed because the texture is quite thin and doesn't seem to have much whitening effect.
1,Not thrilled with the selection
1,Boxes were all crushed may end up throwing them away??????
1,gets messy on the top, won't order again
1,they are gross as heck. don't spend your money. there is nothing that can saves these. taste like cardboard. If you like eating cardboard, then these are perfect for you.
1,I expected to love these but they just weren't that great. I prefer Girl Scouts Tagalongs, which another customer said these were better than. They are not. My 7 year old son who loves PB didn't even like them.
1,you can taste the powder quite a lot. You can feel it in your drink while tasting it. No I can not recommend it.
1,I do not like it at all
1,I really like really sudsy, soapy body was and this just does not lather like I want it too.  Will not purchase again
1,Since we've eliminated the diet soda, I thought we'd try something new - something carbonated - something tropical.  Um, the taste is club soda-like with a dash of citrus.  Not good in my opinion.  I'm wondering if the flavor can be enhanced with some fruit juices so I don't end up dumping the remaining cans.  I'm not a drinker, but maybe this would work well with gin or vodka?  "Exotic"? ((shaking head no))  Nah, not on my future "buy me" list!
1,Not a good flavor, honey roasted is way better
1,Yucky, ruined otherwise good ground beef
1,Very bland for a chai.  Disappointed.
1,These break very easily and a small handful are needed to properly floss.  I will not buy these again and probably won't use all that I bought.
1,Maybe my expectations were wrong because I thought this coconut was awful.  I love Bob's product and thought I would try this coconut, since it had great reviews.  I thought it was dry and lacked flavor so I sent it back.
1,too salty ..not sure where they found sea salt so rediulously strong and just not great.  Dont waste your money.
1,Back in the day my friends and I would refer to under-brewed tea as "stump water" since we figured water in a stump would have about the same amount of flavoring. Folks, I'd like to introduce you all to this name-brand stump water here! Seriously, the only flavor it had was sweet and slightly fruity water. I can get more flavor by squeezing a slice of lemon or lime into a large glass of water than this stuff had.
1,Nothing like what I used to get at Costco for much less money. Disappointing.
1,Tastes gross. I love diet teas, but this one isn't doin it for me. Kirkland brand is 100x better than Lipton.
1,Mostly broth. Very little edible content. Left me hungry and feeling taken advantage of. I bought a name and got mostly a can of broth.
1,Well we'll see, still getting used to the idea of Ritz Crackers made in Mexico. Hey If they taste okay and are crisp, whahoooo.
1,The pasta is find, but the mix is not that tasty and there's very little of it. I had to use two packages of the mix on one meal of pasta, just to get my taste buds working. Not worth it !
1,Tastes like poop. I have to eat low sodium products, but I expet them to be a lot tastier than this stuff.
1,Not a favorite, nice bite sizes but the price is a bit much for how small the bag is.
1,Whoever packed this order packed everything together all of my groceries were smashed and my carpet freshener had exploded and covered everything so half of my order has to be thrown away.
1,Tasted watered down. Other brand at warehouse club was much better and good price.
1,is like a can of water with half a bouillon of chicken flavor and sparse of any actual chicken or anything really.  might be good starter to make your own soup with which is how i ended up using it.
1,Seems ok so far.
1,Little one got sick of these quickly.... NO FIBER.... I should have checked the ingredients first
1,we use all Method products - they seem to either be top notch or 'what is it and what does it actually do?'. Doesn't leave a 'clean smell' as their other cleaners do ie abscence of less than fresh odors.
1,Filling has changed, much less flavor, tastes saturated and bland.
1,I like a little more peach flavor, these don't taste that great to me.
1,Not a good product. I might as well not wear mascara because that's what it looks like when I wear this.
1,just was not that good.
1,It's cereal, right? How bad could it be? Well, in this case, pretty damned bad. I was expecting something like Chex filled with chocolate because that's what they look like, but the whole grain outside tastes terrible. I couldn't finish it. My father liked snacking on them with coffee, so I gave them a two instead of one star.
1,We usually like chips ahoy cookies of all kinds, but these were not even kinda of good. There was too much candy and chips for the amount of dough.  Maybe they will be just the right thing for you, hop so.
1,Once I poured the milk on my bowl of EnviroKidz Organic Chocolate Koala Crisp Cereal, the chocolate slowly started coming off of the cereal and into the milk. The cereal absorbs the milk and causes the cereal to swell and have the most unpleasant, mushy texture. Maybe kids like it, but, as an adult who occasionally enjoys eating kids cereals, this cereal is awful.		I'm actively cutting any GMO products out of my diet. Kellogg's Cocoa Krispies has been a long time favorite of mine but contains High Fructose Corn Syrup, most likely made from GMO corn. I thought this would be a great substitute. I'm hoping to find some cereal that equals what I'm used to eating in texture and taste to an acceptable degree. I am so sick of granola and hope I can find some cereals that I actually like.
1,No taste and hard raisins
1,Prefer regular wrap.
1,4 cans were swollen up and could not be used.
1,Arrived smashed
1,A less toxic option but I have to either rinse the dishes first, a big waste of water, or run the pots and pans cycle, a waste of water and electricity.  I'm using them up for lightly soiled loads, but will not buy them again.  Generally I like 7th generation products, but not this one.
1,Too molassesy.  Dry tasting.
1,Not good value for the money.
1,Was between this & the plain jane 'multibran' variety during a Warehouse firesale, and am upset I went against previous experience (& thus my instinct) & went for these. The addition of raisins means you get less bran, since they're packaged by weight, and that you also can look forward to some tooth strengthening.
1,Really, really great product. Wonderful product for anyone in need of a good gluten free cereal. You will have no idea that it's gluten free. Taste, texture, and digestion are all excellent.
1,I always buy Dole Pineapple in the can, but I won't buy these again.  Dole doesn't cut the core of the pineapple off of the ends.  It's like trying to chew straw,  The peaches are good.
1,not  very foamy
1,Didn't taste as good as I expected.
1,Bought these for my been yfridend he broke up with me soon after
1,Nasty taste. I drink original Perrier all the time and love it, but they do not seem to do a very good job with their flavors (I prefer Polar flavored sparkling water).
1,Overly sweet, artificial after-taste.
1,When i received the box it was damaged and laundry detergent was all inside box spilled on food and can of sprite was exploded and cookies had soap all over them and box of Barilla Pasta, Spaghetti, 32 Ounce was open and popcorn with soap every where so I am a little mad right now!!
1,This is an OK product for lightly conditioning the hair, but I expected something more hydrating from a mask. I did not expect a mask to repair the damage in my hair, but I expected more smoothness after applying this. My hair is definitely not overly processed (I never died my hair). This mask just makes my hair not tangle, leaving it barely hydrated.		The tub was not sealed when I received this.
1,mini mini
1,This is non-stick?? Well, it sure sticks to bbq ribs. Not worth the price or claims.
1,Someone gave me this. It has a nice scent. However, the scent does not last. Also, it made me perspire more using it.  I will stay with my favirite.
1,Cheap for a reason
1,I hated the taste.
1,I used this for my SENSITIVE SIN and it immediately BURNED my face! I had to rinse my sin for a good ten minutes with cold water to get the burning to stop. I reported this to Amazon and the representative said she'd tell AMAZON HQ  about this bad experience. TERRIBLE experience and the burning was awful!
1,Grew hideous white mold within days.  The whole idea of jerky is preservation.  Jerky was invented before refrigeration to preserve meats.  Jerky should last months without refrigeration and without decay.  Whatever Jack did to this meat made it mold faster.
1,Way too spicy and hot, didn't taste any lime.
1,It would have been alright but it was packed with no-food items and had a soapy smell. I had to pitch it.
1,NOT as I remembered from my childhood.  Frosting on the tops was dried out and crumbly (As a child, I recall that peeling off the top frosting layer was my method of consumption, NOT possible with these), very little creamy filling in the middle.		Over all, an incredibly poor facsimile of the original Hostess Cupcakes that most of us knew and loved.  Sad, and incredibly disappointing.
1,horrifying taste, overwhelming sweetness.  not enough to be just sugary sweetness, sometimes it tastes like watered down semi-fermented syrup (like the kind you put on pancakes), sometimes it tastes like a tree.  the aftertaste is overwhelming and lasts basically all day unless you drink something else.
1,I don't know if Kleenex has changed its process or what, but this Kleenex has some issues I've never experienced w/any other tissue.  It's soft enough, and I guess the thickness is ok, but every time you pull out a tissue you get a shower of little "lint" balls.  Not just a couple, and it leaves a residue of tiny little balls all over the place.  Just weird.  It makes a mess, and I have enough to clean up w/o cleaning up that all day.  I will try something else.
1,sounded so good, but didn't really like it
1,Really love this detergent! But the size of the container at the price I paid was not right. For that price I should have gotten a full size, instead we got a tiny bottle.
1,Just not the Cherry Pie flavor. It's more sweet compared to other varieties of Larabars, and I dislike how tart it is. But, I'm also not big into cherries to begin with.
1,These smell too much like Rachel Ray. My dog won't eat them.
1,This is very sweet! Super grain is a great idea though. I wish there was a no sugar added version or low sugar?
1,Does not taste good at all.
1,none
1,Sadly, this sugarfree version of Juicy Fruit gum is a weak cousin to the original. Just like "real" Juicy Fruit, this gum has a quick pop of flavor that fades into nothingness in about 5 minutes. The big difference: this sugarfree gum leaves you with a chemical-aftertaste nothingness---yuck. The only good thing? I don't have to nag the kids to spit out their gum, they do it willingly.
1,I had to call the corporate office and tell them that since I've been getting this tea through primepantry that apparently in the processing there is not enough tea syrup being added.  It is about 50% of the time pale green water.  I've been drinking this tea for years so I know when something is wrong.  It is very sensitive to light and heat but then it gets too sweet, not pale and tasteless.  I HOPE they are able to audit the processing at the plant and find out what the problem is.  On the bottle it says Purchase, NY but that is the main office.  Not sure if it is bottled there.  When it is as it should be I love this tea.  It is not too sweet and not carbonated; just right.  Quenches my thirst perfectly.
1,Not nearly as good as the Chili Cheese type. Ranch doesn't make everything better, unlike bacon.
1,These are a little two thick and start making me a little sore after an hour or so. Won't purchase again.
1,These are reminiscent of other oatmeal bars that quaker has made in the past.  The bars sit in a strange place as far as texture and consistency.  They are very dense and chewy but still have some crunchy oats and grains.  This is what I imagine it would taste like if a prepared packet of instant oatmeal was allowed to cool completely, had a dry packet of oatmeal added to it and mixed in, and was pressed into a bar.  The flavor is fine, it's just the texture that I'm not a fan of.
1,somehow I recall a different product...this one has a under taste I don't like
1,Ugh - I can't eat this stuff.
1,DID NOT KNOW THESE HAD DAWN IN THEM.
1,They were CRUSHED LIKE MY DREAMS WHEN I OPENED THE BAG TO FIND UNSCOOPABLE CHIPS FOR MY GAUC
1,I like the bars, but this one is not as tasty as I thought.
1,if you want salty and crunchy, it's both of those things. otherwise it's not much flavor and i would not buy these again.
1,Not as good as expected. Leaves a slight bitter aftertaste.  Not up to standard for Newman branded products.
1,this taste horrible!!! do not recommend
1,it says 12 hours but only last abut 3
1,eh. not the best. doesn't taste great. Certainly wouldn't purchase again.
1,The FIRST thing I noticed was how HUGE this bottle is...So, it IS a really good price for what it does AND how much you get!  But, I just did NOT like the taste at all.  So, unfortunately, I had to throw it away.  The taste isn't as strong or as bad as Listerine but now I know why my Dentist's Assistant recommended the "Act" Mouthwash.  I HAVE tried the Act Mouthwash before but I didn't know that it has alcohol in it so that's the reason I wanted to try the Colgate Brand.
