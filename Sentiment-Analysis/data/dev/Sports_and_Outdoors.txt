0,Forget fuzzies getting stuck to your felt mats or the material separating from rolling and unrolling.  These Lyman mats stay put where you lay them out and are very durable.  I've thrown away my black gun mats and replaced with these for everything.  Black pins and springs don't vanish with the contrasting color and you have compartmentalized sections like a shallow lunch tray to help keep your bits and pieces organized as you dissemble different firearms.  My only beef is I'd like to see one in 48" instead of just the 36" rifle mat.  If they come out with those I'd add them as well.
0,These work great, but the fit is a little overly tight.  For me, they were uncomfortable, but my wife liked them (so perhaps more ideal for the slightly smaller head).		There is a single amplifier and control, and single pair of AA batteries needed.
0,Awesome product!
0,Easy to install an well made.		It can hold a LOT of stuff.		One thing though: I'm noticing the bottom of one is (maybe) wearing out a bit. I might reinforce it with black gorilla tape just to keep it secure.
0,I've got a 45 long colt (Single Action) and I wanted to get something that would work but not be too expensive for practicing for SASS. This was a good buy, fits my 4.75" revolver very well and is perfect for me to see how well I like this before spending a LOT on a rig. The leather ones are expensive but this is great for what I need.		Highly recommended!
0,I've already suffered thru a couple "heavy duty" batting tees that fell apart pretty quick so I'm always skeptical shopping for another.  This one has a very rubbery heavy duty feel.  The top feels as tough as any other I've used.  The only slight concern is that the top pulls up and pushes down very easy, it feels as though it's going to just start slipping on it's own pretty soon.  No big deal though, I'll just put a layer of duct tape around it and that will give the resistance to keep it from slipping.  BTW, style is great, but that's all pretty clear in the pic so no need for me to give my opinion on that.
0,Bought these for my Step- Dad and he loves them. They really protect his hands.
0,I'm pretty curious and I like taking things apart and looking how things go together and how they work, if it looks and feels like it is well made.	I have come across many flashlights touting they have the brightest and best flashlight on the market.	I believe I am now the owner of one of the best and well made flashlight on the market!	This is made of Aircraft Grade Alloy it's very light but also rigid very nice and you can feel when your holding it in your hand.	The Cree LED puts out 350 Lumens (Green) take a look at the close up picture of the LED I put a small thumb tack above it so you can get an idea the size of the light. How something that small is so bright is truly amazing to me.	The distance on this is 250 yards that's yards not feet. It takes 1 18650 Li-Ion Battey 2 are included plus a battery charger. Very cool. Also comes with a pressure sensors and bracket for mounting on the firearm. This is mainly used for Hunting and fishing the Green and Red lights don't spook the game your after and can be a huge benefit. Everything you need to mount this light is included.	You will see in the pictures that it has 6 Gaskets/O rings outside the LED is a Aluminium housing not plastic like many others are.	This is the nicest best built flashlight I have ever owned. This has exceeded all of my expectations and I am very happy and satisfied with my flashlight.		Discloser	I received this product at a substantial discount or free for my honest review.
0,Perfect replacement
0,Best deal on sunglasses I have ever found. Super well made and look great. Block the sun nicely.
0,Brilliant device.  Now, I eat literally every meal that requires a spoon, fork, or knife with this handy little spork.		For starters, it's made of titanium, so it's at least as strong as steel, but is about half as heavy and naturally highly resistant to corrosion.  The tines are sharp and pointed enough to stab whatever you're eating, and I've been able to cut through even my steak with relative ease using the sides.  And the price is right!		Only negative thing I've noticed is using it to normally stab, scoop, or cut anything will scratch up some plates and bowls.  Drives my wife up a wall, but usually I use my own steel bowls and plates anyway.
0,Great product and real strong.  Hammering away and no bending on any of them!
0,Strong,bright and EZ to use...love this product
0,Decent quality, padded, inconspicuous locking case. Meets my vehicle carry needs.		Could use more internal storage compartments. I ordered more hook & loop straps from a 3rd party for more storage options.
0,I have a very good friend who teaches Zumba at a local gym.  One of the challenges that can come from being the mom of an amazing special needs kiddo is that I'm not able to catch her classes.  Out of curiosity some time last year, I tried a free Zumba video on-line and despite the fact that I do know some basic dance steps, I felt about as coordinated as a drunken duck.  I told her, you know, I think strength training is just my thing for now.  It's what I need to focus on to be the best mom I can be to my son, and I just need cardio I don't suck at right off the bat. She told me I just needed to try it again, and I said "nah, I'm good."  But the problem is, I get bored quickly, and I switch out my cardio regularly because I think that's a great thing to do from the fitness perspective.  So I'm trying it again because I'm experimenting with dance cardio right now.		It took me a few days to get through this video because my son was not into it.  And even when I could get him to be patient with it, he was doing things like rolling his spinning chair up behind me, or rolling the yoga ball into me.  So it was more of a workout then I expected just to get through it because I was dancing around and dodging obstacles.  And then there was the time he decided maybe if he came up and gave me a good, long squeeze hug I'd put on his Veggie Tales and turn off the Zumba.  He's very determined, so it took me three days to get attempt to get through this for a preview of it.		I think this was well done, definitely for beginners.  I think they do a great job of breaking down the explanations of what you need to be doing.  And I felt enlivened and just downright joyful after each section I was able to get through before my son hit combustion mode. And quite honestly, Beto's presentation is so cheerful, happy, and encouraging that it just made it that much better.  I feel like I need a hefty dose of cheerful and encouraging in my life sometimes.  I also really liked that the two dancers working with him in this particular video were a healthy size (I can not say what they are like in any others from this production company, as this is the first one I've purchased), and one of them even appeared to be large framed like me.  And I like that they were more covered up.  I think all of those things are a very nice thing for a beginner to see, because if you are just starting out exercising, even if you want to be super petite and have lovely muscle definition, sometimes it can feel pretty intimidating to be confronted with in your face images of that right off the bat.		I also like that the workout they include after the section that goes over the basic steps doesn't add to many other movements, because from the learning perspective, repetition is actually the best way to get a movement down and it helps build confidence a lot better then if a bunch of new stuff that hadn't been demonstrated were thrown in. And I managed to finish this video feeling more like a Latin dance cardio swan then a drunken duck this time, so I think I'm probably going to end up adopting Zumba for my dance cardio thing that I work in with my HIIT stuff.  I had a lot of fun doing this, more then I expected.  And my friend will probably say "I told you so."  And I will just give her a hug for being right.
0,this cable lock is very easy to use and it stores into the mount that comes with it. very compact. i use it all the time. No Complaints
0,Very nice upgrade from my old bag. Fits all my gear and I have some room left. Very good quality and looks like it will be durable.
0,I bought this mask and have used it one time.  I removed the chin strap first thing because the mask fits really well.  It is very light weight and I found it very comfortable.  I would recommend this for anyone that is looking for mask!!
0,fit great on my girsan g2 1911 and adds great looks and practicality also!
0,You gotta have one of these if your sporting the 35 rounders.  This runs along the back of the mag and presses the follower down so you can drop rounds in.  Works perfect as expected but i will say that its just a simple piece of plastic and its lifespan could be questionable inside of a range bag.
0,Awesome light! This thing is bright and the zoomable beam works really well.  Very satisfied with this as a stand alone flashlight as well.  I give it an A+
0,This is very handy for any card game that uses more than one deck of cards
0,Fantastic quality.  I have not been disappointed yet with any of the Tipton cleaning line.
0,Under Armour = Best Shorts
0,Comfortable, Easy Equipment		I usually rent snorkeling equipment when on vacation. I enjoyed myself using this brand in the past and jumped at the chance to own the same equipment. I'm happy to have my own rather than renting those that have been used by others. I have my own now without those worries. The fit and the valve system seems comfortable and easier for me to use. The case makes storing and packing easier too.		I highly recommend this if you enjoy snorkeling!
0,Perfect fit kept the sun burn and moisture out the whole day, was dry and comfortable despite being out on the hot desert sun.
0,Really good product poor packaging.
0,Camelbak products are fantastic and serve their purpose every time.
0,I got back in to yoga and decided to replace my very cheap mat with this one. It is so much more comfortable on my hands and knees in poses. I like the extra length and that the pattern is very subtle so it feels smooth. I use it on hardwood and it does not move or slide at all. The only con is that after being unrolled the mat never really lies completely flat even after an hour class. The far edge will still have some curl in it but I notice many other mats in class are the same way. It cleans down and dries quickly. I would recommend this mat.
0,Didn't fit my Glock 21 Gen 4, but it's well made so there was no reason for me not to give it five stars. The emblem is bright, and looks good.
0,Fits Glock 26 with a little room in the front, meaning it will accept up to a Glock 19.  I think the 17 would be too long.  Spend the extra money and get an Incog holster, they are the best on the market right now no matter what anyone says (besides me lol).  Really though, in my opinion and a friend in the US Marines, it's the best.
0,I have not used it much yet but it does work fairly well. Bright with three settings. Not as bright as Portland Design Works which I would give five stars.
0,These handlebars were perfect for what I was trying to do. I converted my mountain bike to be a beach cruiser and these handle bars were perfect. I can sit up when cruising around town now instead of hunched over.
0,Cool paracord bracelet. It is rather large for a bracelet thought. It can almost slip off.
0,Outstanding
0,Great product. The only thing I was disappointed about is the Allen screw seem a little clunky
0,I gave these to my husband for Christmas and he installed them the next day. Went out fishing and no more leaning over to grab the downrigger weights. Exactly what we needed. Can't beat Scotty quality.
0,Nice, great backpacking towel.
0,ok
0,Super easy to install and looks cute for little girls bike!
0,Works great.
0,The best mono out there, and Amazon's deal was plain crazy!
0,Great Buy!!! Exactly what I wanted
0,Omg, I love these lights!!!!!!!  I have seven of them. I purchased others for my friends and family. Always good to get two or more. Charge them, use one or two at a time and when they die you still have one to use.
0,When it comes to gym equipment, no matter what the targeted activity is, quality counts or you just won't use it.		Where exercise is concerned, I am considered a frequent/heavy user where my training equipment is concerned so I did not want to cut any corners on something so basic and essential to overall fitness as a sit-up bench.		Right out of the box, this bench has components of very heavy duty square tube steel.  The shin pads are super dense and perfectly placed for someone of average height.		The decline angle is perfect, the length of the back padded board is of just the right length to provide freedom of movement without lower back stress.		The radius of the padded bench behind the knees does not stress the joints and is padded enough, yet firm, so you get a very solid feel as you train and condition your mid section.		There are less expensive sit-up benches out there, but as I said before, badly designed or poorly constructed gear just won't get used.  My wife also loves it and jumps on for a few reps as she passes through the room where it stands ready in the corner.  It doesn't take up much floor space, so can be left in the corner of your living room or someone's bedroom where it will encourage frequent use.		The paint finish seems to also be of good quality and as there are no real wear surfaces, I can't see the painted finish deteriorating no matter how much use it receives.		Couldn't have asked for a better design and can't imagine that it will ever wear out with proper care and cleaning.		I would definitely recommend this as a prime piece of gear for abdominal conditioning... far better than doing crunches or situps on the floor.  The design angle allows for full extension of the abs, for development throughout the muscle range.		Get one, you will use it.  There are no shortcuts to real fitness, this is primary gear for any conditioning program.
0,Fit on my Suntracker perfectly, will be ordering 2 more.	Dennis
0,These gloves are comfortable and seem to offer pretty good protection. The protection looks better than the more expensive Giro Xen. I haven't had them long enough to comment on durability.
0,Excellent product, as expected.
0,Bought for my boyfriend. He loves it and even uses it to film some cool shots with his phone. Very sturdy.
0,Thing is an absolute must in any bag as part of an  emergency shelter setup.
0,geat knife will buy again better made than org
0,Perfect bench holder.
0,grateful for amazon basics!
0,My girlfriend does not like wearing a camelback-style pouch, so this works perfectly for her.  She does not care for the spout, and will probably replace the cap to get a different spout.
0,I like this tent quite a lot. It's a bit heavier than I wanted, coming in at 5 pounds, but that is my own fault for not checking before I purchased.  It fits well on my pack though and will very comfortably fit myself and my gear when I'm hiking.  It would probably fit 2 people, but you would have to be okay with getting close. I like that it has two doors, so that if you do have multiple people you don't have to disturb the other when getting out at night. The rain fly seems sturdy and like it will do the job. It is a bit tricky to get it folded down into the bag again, but not anything a little practice wouldn't solve. I would buy this again.
0,I like it
0,Haven't had it out on the trail yet but it is very bright and I'm sure will do the trick.
0,The bad: The clips are difficult to thread through the saddle rails when re-attaching the bag. Re-attaching it to the bike is awkward. Blinky light attachment not tight enough to hold a Planet Bike Superflash (I tried).		The good: Small, holds exactly what is needed, excellent construction. Quick to remove from bike. Value for price is great.		Mine holds:	Tube for 28c tire	Tire lever	Key for locking skewers	Patches, paper, and glue	Two cartridges	One micro inflater head	One multitool	Car or house key	$20		It's easy to take off my bike in sketchy areas, and now I always have my patch kit with me.
0,Useful for puppy mess-ups and stinky teenagers.  You lightly mist it over whatever the object is that you want to deodorize. It has a light, fresh scent, very subtle.  It seems to help.
0,Using as a holder/stand for my crossman air pistol excellent for putting this on a table or on the wall to hold my pistol when not in use
0,Just get it, amazing bag, super tough, I might get another... and get one for my wife lol
0,Love it hate it . I don't love tying it since I can't see well but once it is on it is superior . And it is tough .
0,Good material, good fit, good price. Perfect for work.
0,Use it to for jerky really like it
0,Pretty cool ring.  Very comfortable but the sizes are off. They run small, FYI
0,This product works hahah... I recommend it to all longboarders that's what I use it for and it does not compromise mobility or movements.
0,Nice shirt; order one size up.  Especially if made in China; sometimes 2 sizes up.  But has been worn & washed many times and still in great condition.
0,Very nice
0,Works great for bench shooting but would get a taller one for shooting
0,If you want or need a big knife without breaking the budget, Schrade has you covered.	I like the feel of the SCHF 37. Comes with a nice sheath, sharpening block, ferro  rod.		Please check "Yes" if you have found this review helpful. I rely upon others' reviews to make an informed decision	anytime I make a purchase, so it is my intention to help others do the same. I welcome any questions or feedback.
0,Great product for the price.  Well built and what you'd expect from a low-end Viking cue.  The only complaint I have about it is that the stain color did not appear perfectly uniform: the blue stain on the bottom of the handle (below the wrap) is very blue and the blue above the wrap is more like a teal.  Barely noticeable, so much that I just noticed it now and I've been playing with it for weeks.  The wrap is well done, nicely weighted, the joint solid, the tip perfectly rounded.  The shaft is lacquered just a few inches above the joint and clean the rest of the way to the tip.  I put several coats of cue wax on there and it has served me very well at the tables. Where the ferrule is placed on the shaft is perfectly smooth, no raised lip where the plastic meets the wood.
0,Bought to use as hide construction material for bird hunting. Not as great as the quality of camo netting I have used while in the service, but for the price its not bad. Obviously you have to add local vegetation during construction to get a really decent hide, otherwise the product is a bit too reflective and will not blend well into the surroundings.
0,should have had this years ago, why did I wait so long?
0,I keep this in my vehicle winter emergency kit. with a couple cans of soup and some Mountain House freeze dried meals. I use with my Stanley Adventure Camp Cook Set,  MSR 775 ml Stowaway Pot, MSR Handheld Piezo Igniter, and the MSR Universal Canister Stand.
0,My husband loves this for his lunches! He works in a metal shop, and needed something sturdy. This is very well made an has held up through so much punishment. He loves the pockets on the sides and front (he packs his tape measure, rulers, stopwatch and various other items in them, plus the ties on the top hold his gloves.
0,Happy to have such a well-made loader that fits my CC perfectly.  Husband was so impressed with the machining that he wants to order extras.  Work well and American Made at a good price.  Can't ask for much more.
0,Love these socks for running and workin outside. Great fit and super soft. They breath very well and prevent blisters because they are a perfect height on the heal. Would recommend this brand for all running socks.
0,The BEST bike tire pump. Very well made and easy to use. Works with all the commonly used tire valves.	 However there are no directions for use. Had to go on line to find out how to use it.
0,More accurate than the .20's. I'll be ordering more in the future.
0,This is,a great product. I in a panic both this because of the price. Affordable. I couldn't find my expendive one I've had for years. Lost in a move.	I'm very happy with this. It works great and is accurate. I'd buy it again.
0,Good nap and just what I needed.
0,I love these.  I bought two.  The rope does seem flimsy and the carabiner does seem flimsy too, but for the less than $15 price what can you expect?  I plan to replace the rope and carabiner when it fails.
0,Great seat, high quality. Good pricing and the high back is extra comfortable. Foam seems to be breaking in nicely; heavy duty stitching and fabric.
0,great range holster
0,I like it and it works great
0,The knives were a little bigger than expected which was a good surprise. Very well made and balanced for throwing.
0,Fits well on top of  undergarment and Kevlar BPV. I'm 5'10 205 lbs. it's made pretty rugged and holds the clips nicely.
0,Thanks !!!
0,Nice rod. Is truly compact.
0,A very cozy and high quality personal backpacking tent. I use this for extended hunting and backpacking trips. It's great for all kinds of California weather (haven't tested in snow or rain). The setup is quick and secure. I love how the door has it's own covering so you can put your pack/large items/shoes outside of the tent (but it won't get rained on). I am 5'9" and I fit perfectly in the tent with a little leg room to spare (it's longer than wider). I highly recommend this tent!
0,Useful.  Be safe when running or biking at night.
0,Good buy for the price.
0,This mat has made yoga more enjoyable.  I can use it under my knees, hands, or feet.  Years ago I broke a bone on the side of my foot, and the Lotus pose puts too much pressure on the area.  Before this mat I had to skip the pose and with it I can join in and enjoy the stretch.
0,I love everything from this company. It's The same work this product.  It works and is affordable.  They Make quality products for the price
0,My husband LOVES this holster - says it fits perfectly and very comfortable!  This is his 2nd Outbags LOB1P... he like the black one so much, he 'needed' a brown one!  GREAT holster, GREAT price!
0,Quality cord! Thanks
0,Good
0,Working perfectly
0,I've used this item for several years. When lead and fouling are difficult to remove, this product can be cut into pieces as large or small as necessary to get the job done. It really works, and it works well!
0,Have like this spit for sometime now.
0,Crazy little $10 stove ROCKS! Used it to boil water for everything from coffee to mountain house dinners. Started every time with the first click of the igniter and is super adjustable. Packs up super small, I did have to tweak the fold out arms a little. Seriously no big deal and probably not all that necessary. If you are reading this and thinking about getting it.....do it!!!!
0,I bought this bar because I have a 35" hallway I wanted to mount a bar in. I had bought another cheaper bar from Amazon first but returned after it came apart at 34" when advertised up to 36". So I paid more and bought this which advertised up to 40" and it fits my hallway just fine. It seems very secure at 35".		The removable adjustable grips are a nice plus, I haven't seen that on a pullup bar before. Because they are removable they're not as thick as most other bars and slide a little bit toward the center when in a wide grip position. I wish it came with a second pair for wide and narrow pulls.		Warning: They only provide tiny little 1" wood screws that not sufficient for drywall-to-stud mounting and I personally would question even using them for a door frame. Make a quick trip to the hardware store and get yourself some proper wood screws. I wish the holes in the cups were large enough for lag bolts but I made do with some good 2.5" wood screws.
0,My favorite outside the waistband hands down. Best off duty hilster I have found
0,I have had this chair for years and it has held up wonderfully. Its easy to carry has a huge storage pocket on the back and it is extremely comfortable. Also, the back is adjustable which makes it perfect for every situation.
0,Fit good right away but after one wash shrunk a little more than I'd like.  Comfortable thermal though.
0,Just the right size and bright.
0,Tight fit as expected. Work great.
0,Very robust stand, exceeded my expectations. Easy and quick to use.  Build quality was excellent.	Would recommend this stand to anyone looking for a reasonably priced and substantial product.	It also had one of the highest recommendations from other buyers.
0,It's good for attention to people like excuse me!  I don't mean to run over anybody.
0,great
0,Works perfect
0,Nice quality.
0,you could spend way more on the camelback brands or just go with this one which is just as nice if not nicer.  great buy. no complaints.
0,This is a nice, tough sling bag/backpack which would do well as a get-home bag or BOB for someone in an urban area. It's understated enough--not so tactical-looking as to draw a lot of attention to itself and to you. I bought it with the idea of using it as a gear bag for ham radio outings, and possibly short-term emergency communication scenarios. I haven't even begun to break this in--I'll update this review when that begins to happen.
0,I wasn't expecting these glove liners to be this warm considering how thin they are.  The silk is very high quality and sturdy so I don't worry about tearing the glove just by putting it on.  On a cold day I can easily wear my gloves over these, and on a not as cold day I can wear just the Thermasilk liner.  Exactly what I was looking for and a very affordable price.
0,Great for beginners. I got this because I didn't know much getting into fly fishing. This has alot for the money.
0,these are great - they are not as good quality as the real buff and only printed on one side, which is expected because the price is so much better - so if using as a headband it is easy for the white side to accidentally show which is not cute - but they work really well for workouts/ taming hair/ a light hat/ face mask when doing yardwork.  I always keep on in my purse in case I need it.
0,This is a solid foam roller. Good firmness without feeling like 4in pvc.
0,Nice bottle but has quality issues.		PROS	Nice shape and size	Looks cool and keeps stuff hot or cold for many hours (as do all double walled steel bottles)		CONS	The inside of the lid is made from thin soft plastic, not sure how long it will last	The thin coat of paint chips easily		I left the bottle in my car's bottle holder during a hot (~90) day, and the following morning a bunch of paint just peeled off the bottom and onto the rubber padding of the cup holder.  Have had several similar bottles and have never seen this happen before.  Maybe mine's a dud, but judging from the very thin coat of paint, this is likely a common issue.		UPDATE:  Was contacted by Ezi support who offered me a full refund or replacement, and quickly processed it.  So the customer service is great if you do have issues with the item.
0,A little tough to install but well worth it
0,Its better than my nold grip
0,Good quality and value.
0,It's a plate cover. What else it there to say. It's metal and fit around your plate. So far I've had it for a month as it hasn't rusted, so it's OK. Be WARNED... You only get one plate when ordering. So the price it doubled if you want 2. Kind of a rip off... Who only buys 1 plate cover when you have 2 plates. Anyways... for Redskins fans it works.
0,I got this from budk.com bogo sale for $9.99 and love it once you get it sharp and a good edge on it your good to go. I have trained for many years with karambit knifes and by far this blade is amazing easy to keep hidden and fast to draw ... no complains on the case
0,Got these for my 7 year old, these are real nice and do not get destroyed in seconds like the bootleg toy ones sold these days.
0,This cap is an important part of my hair maintenance system.  I have thick, curly-kinky hair, and it can be difficult to get into a swim cap without damaging it.  In addition, my head is rather large.  The lycra cap helps me get my hair up and out of my face, and it fits comfortably around my head without being too tight or giving me headaches.  This is NOT going to keep your hair dry.  That being said, I do put conditioner on my hair and cover it with a plastic conditioning cap before I put the lycra cap on.  It keeps my hair less wet and in better condition.  Frankly, I have yet to discover any system that keeps the hair completely dry.  But that's ok.  At least I am comfortable and fashionable.  The colors of the cap are great.
0,Great bases
0,For when I flip you off.
0,So far so good. Like them very much.
0,I ordered this product for my dad as part of an emergency kit I put together for him to have on the farm where he works all day building things, driving and working on farm equipment, cutting wood, etc. He is miles from any house and even further from the hospital so it will well in case of an emergency.
0,Taste great
0,Just as described. Shipped fast. Thank you!
0,I'm in my 50s, so backhand I have difficulty making this destroyer fly correctly.  What I love about this disc is when I'm facing a headwind it reliably holds straight then fades left, and I love flicking this disc anytime.
0,Comfortable shorts with good padding. Have gone as far as 28 miles straight in these and no issues and that is the way shorts should be...you should not notice them. Size ran pretty true to my pants size.
0,Works great for my sons razor dirt bike 650. Charges fast. Delivered fast.
0,keeps the promise as advertised. Food stays really hot even after 5 hours. So my kids love it.	Easy to clean within.	Easy to fill-up with food or soups.	highly recommend.
0,Great deal
0,EDIT:  I've had these sunglasses for a year now, and they are still alright.  However, one of the screws has repeatedly been coming loose as I put them on and take them off.  Small complaint for such cheap shades.  I would still recommend them, but take note that they have a production flaw of placing the screws on the bottoms of the hinges, rather than the tops.	-----	Great pair of cheap sunglasses!  I knew I wasn't going to blow more that $10 on some shades, so I found a couple of pairs I could buy for less than that combined.  I've had them for a few months now.  They are your standard cheap Wayfarer knock-offs.  They fit well, and haven't broken.  Overall, I'm pleased with these shades, and recommend them to anyone wanting the same thing.
0,Nothing wrong with the helmet at all besides the looks. I feel like Toad from Mario Bros. Very comfortable and the dial makes it easy to adjust. I ride in the woods so not much chance of anyone seeing me .lol
0,Perfect.  Same size as USGI.
0,Watermelon is by far the best for summer small lake bass in NW Montana. Works like a charm texas rigged around lily pads and docks
0,My son is 9 and it is his first bow. Adjustments are easy and shoots well out of the box
0,Great Product!  So easy.
0,I love this knife, every since I was a little kid I have collected knives and I have had quite a few over the years. This knife is one of my favorite, it feels great in my hand, its not too large and not too small. Came out of the box with a razor sharp edge that is easy to maintain, the sheath that comes with the Ontario is decent, made from thick Kydex I believe. I carry it with my pretty much everywhere I go, its also great for camping on the weekends and backpackers looking for a quality knife that won't break the bank.
0,3 years now-the water still pours off of it! when you take it out of the washer, it's barely wet-super waterproof! great 3 season protection, excluding summer. toasty in winter no matter what, but overheats seriously above 60 degrees F in summer. quality hat.
0,Magpul quality, what else is there to say.
0,As Advertised
0,Make sure you get ropes or bungee cord to keep the pedals and front wheel from moving... I took it to the beach and I was very pleased. I did not look in detail to see if my car was okay, so I need to check on that and right another update, but nothing obvious so far
0,As always, the fit and quality of this Hogue grip is outstanding. I wouldn't buy any other brand grip
0,Did not fit but seller took back
0,The bike was delivered in 3 days. Thirty minutes after it arrived I rode the bike 5 miles. It's a 18" frame, but I am 6'2" at 235 lbs and with the seat post at it's max. it was fine.  The great thing is that my 12 yr. old grandson (at 70 lbs.) was also able to ride it with the seat all the way down today.  I also took it to the State Park today and had a great time riding with my granddaughter.  The 7 speeds were ok. It is a great cruiser, especially with rough roads, gravel, grass.  It is a bit heavy, but so am I :).  3-11-16. Another 10 miles on back roads today. No problems. Had to tweet the shifting so it does not skip, but just a few turns and it is good.
0,Great umbrella. Fits the two of us in our (tall) folding camping chairs perfectly. Needs better stakes---the small metal ones that come with it do NOTHING in the sand. Also fits in its case into my car (Honda civic) trunk, so stores well. I did buy the stake for the center pole separately, as it won't work in windy conditions typical of Hawaiian beaches, but so far so good!
0,Nice addition to my backpacking equipment.
0,Great gloves, especially at this price point.  Fit fine, warm down to zero degrees F,.
0,Awesome.  A lot cooler in person.
0,Product worked/works fine, takes a lot to make it stop.  I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a top of the line product in this space.
0,it is surprisingly simple, it is very basic and easy to understand, i have no qualms with it and i have to say it appears to be a good product, i have yet to use it but i like its basic simplicity and useful tools it has, i recommend this product if you want simplicity and function... that is all
0,This tool is genius. Although I wouldn't try to crank down on it like a wrench for fear that it might slip but with dive equipment you can properly tighten or loosen just about everything with it.
0,Great back pack, survival or camping accessory.
0,Fits perfectly on the Caldwell Rock Jr. looks good feels good.
0,Bright, I like the LED blinking options. Need to be sure to keep it charged up though. I accidently let mine go dead after about 8 hours of use without a charge. Although I have an aero seatpost on my Giant Defy road bike, I cut two small slits in the back of my seatbag for the taillight wings to slip through and I wrap and attach them around a CO2 canister inside the seatbag. Holds firmly. Best taillight I have and I have several others.
0,I'm giving 4 stars because I've really liked their products and have worn them for quite sometime. I bought a large pair as I always do threw them and apparently they changed how they are made. The length in the legs now are far to long and I am constantly pulling them up as they sag in the crotch. I wish the reasoning was because I lost 20lbs but that is not the case. So again 4 stars because I have always had great luck with their products. But no 5 star as usual due to a new design. Going to go order a Medium right now and see how long they are in the legs and hope that will due away with the low hanging crotch
0,This is my first wireless bike computer installation. Guess I just didn't trust not having a wire to transmit the signal. Boy am I ever a convert now. This was by far the easiest bicycle computer installation I have ever done. Wouldn't dream of buying anything else now.
0,A great way to apply oil.  Not too thick, not too thin.
0,After downsizing and selling our weight set, Schwinn exercise bike, BowFlex, and treadmill, I looked for a simpler and effective way to keep in shape without taking an entire room to set up a home gym again.  While another chair of this type caught my eye on a TV ad, research proved that was not of the quality I wanted.  After finding this chair and checking out reviews, I bit the bullet, and could not be happier!!  It is well constructed and VERY simple to use.  I put the included chart in front of me where I can see it as I use the chair.
0,grip much better with this installed with my large hands
0,love the case bought it to hold my 10 1oz silver bar containers they fit perfectly i just had to take the thin one piece of ridged foam out from the very bottom but other than that a perfect case
0,Love the design of them, Cant wait to use these products next month with our league during basketball season.  This was a great addition to our unit and really helped us keep up with who was who.
0,Works great under my wetsuit. I never thought I'd recommend a speedo to anyone, but it's not a speedo that advertises my manhood. I have used these more then a few times at the pool without feeling self conscious. Get a size up, they do run small.
0,Very nice stuff. Completes my kitchen very well. Light and sturdy.
0,Good deal on these patches.
0,these make it much easier to divide my cards	they are thick and durable	a little too long/tall for your typical single column card boxes though, where you turn the cards on their side to put them in the box, it has to be placed in on a slight angle.
0,Lots of great bike tools in one. Not sure I will carry this on the bike as it weighs a lot! Made well!
0,Just what I was looking for and getting harder to find in stores. Holds up a heavy bait
0,Very happy so far, the installation was very easy and it seems very solid. The other thing I really like is that it  functions as a rear sight, I can aquire the bead a lot faster while looking down the valley of the rail. So, even if I don't mount an optic it's still a useful addition to my gun.
0,I love this, it keeps my hot beverages for a VERY VERY long time, I HIGHLY recommend it, i bought one before this and loved it so i bought this smaller one.
0,Looks like a much more expensive scope.  On first sight a friend guessed  "at least $500.00".  I put this on a Ruger 10/22 Target Model.  Bottle caps at 50yrds !
0,In my body work. I think is the type of body. Nothing is perfect. I used to work at home and to take a walk with my dog. Also I used to do my spinning class. Is a nice support for my back and the price is very good.
0,I have arthritis in my hands and these high-quality resistance bands allow me to do a lot of exercises I can't do with free weights.  Highly recommended.
0,Great Product
0,This sheath is a necessary thing to own if you have the special forces shovel, especially if travelling anywhere.  Good quality overall.
0,My sister wanted it so I bought it for her... she loves it. I honestly didn't even know what it was.
0,This spotting scope is a great buy , easy to use ,clear viewing . Brings items up close , would recommend this scope for anyone who	Wants a great spotting scope for little money.
0,This thing is great. Makes it so I can actually get a bit of exercise done at the office. Has really helped with weight-loss and it's very quiet and low impact. My co-workers are debating getting one now.
0,These are lightweight and have good sized zippered pockets for keys, cell phone, etc.  I like that I can adjust the tightness of the bottom of the legs - keeps the wind from creeping up.
0,Bought this after having used these while teaching. Easy to put together, fun to shoot into. Can't wait to put it out on the driveway and dent up the garage door a little!!!
0,Took it with us on our cruise to the Caribbean. Seriously the best purchase ever. Saved us from a very painful sunburn that everyone else got. Takes 2 minutes to set up and take down.
0,great price for work shirts  thank you
0,Great saddle.  Comfortable and low price. Keep in mind that is not very soft.  Actually there's not much padding  but still very comfortable
0,This is a decent intro sleeping bag.  Arrived and works as described, not really a "stuff bag" but a solid starter.
0,Nice product
0,Heavy duty construction that fit my board perfectly and left room for boots, helmet, goggles, gloves, jackets, and a few changes of undergarments. Using it for storage in the off season is great to because everything is in one bag and ready to go.		THERE IS NO PADDING. Some people complained that they were misled about padding. I just want to confirm that there is no padding.		I just flew with it and it did great. There was no damage to the board and it was easy to move around with the shoulder strap which easily attached or detaches.
0,Nice weight.. Great Material - not too rigid - not too soft. Has taken a beating and still going. Flies wonderfully. I don't think you will be disappointed. Kinda pricey for a Frisbee if you ask me, but you do get what you pay for.. Nice Disc.		Reflective etchings on top create a pretty cool scintillating light show in the sun..
0,Works pretty well on my fat bike, very useful and way way way cheaper then a Salsa bag. When it gets nasty I'll just buy another. I wish it was water proof and made of a thicker material but at this cost its perfect and zippers are very nice. It fit my Large Fantom FB4 like a glove. I use it to stash water bottles and my Gopro camera. I'm sure I'll use it to carry layers of clothing, a tire pump and gauge in the future. Really solid mount to the frame doesn't swing or move at all. Quite a upgrade over the seat bags I've owned in the past this reminds me of a back pack for a bike do to its usefulness.
0,Worked well, no complaints.
0,Have you ever tried to open your umbrella in the wind and it went inside out?		We have the perfect kind of weather here in Missouri that often causes just such problems. In fact, in September, when my husband was in the hospital, we had a tornado go overhead and another one pass by only a few miles away. During that second one, I happened to be outdoors in the torrential rains and wind. And, I had this umbrella.		Because of the large canopy, it covered me, and as I watched others struggle with their umbrellas, mine not only provided coverage but remained sturdy in spite of the wind.		I received a free sample of the umbrella to test for my review, but the weather was not included, I had to count on Missouri to provide that.
0,All as described
0,This is a great knife for the price. I specifically picked model for a few reasons.		1. The full tang design. The handles are there to make the grip wider and more comfortable, but could easily be used without them if needed. The top of the knife is thicker than most, especially for it's length.		2. The hand feel. The ridges on the spine give a good solid position for your thumb. The half finger loop on the bottom holds your index finger securely. The knife sits well in the hand and allows a lot of dexterity without losing grip when working in tight places.		3. The blade. It's only sharp on one side so you don't have to worry about hurting yourself from kick back. You can push the blade through something dense from the top. It's also a great length for most any task.		In addition to those points, the sheath is nice and compact. Many have reviewed having issues with it. If you have problems with this sheath being tight, you shouldn't own a knife. If it were any looser, it would certainly be falling out of it within a year from purchase.		Lastly, it's designed to be a boot knife. I wasn't looking for that, but I evaluated it anyway. Don't expect the sheath to clip nicely to your boot. If it does, consider yourself lucky. It does however fit nicely on a belt up to about 1.25" wide.
0,christmas gift. we will see but looks good so far
0,Fantastic
1,Good quality belt, looks good works well fits as expected. Little pricey hope it lasts awhile. Update. Belt is holding up well but is starting to sag a bit. I thought cc belts had metal in them to prevent sagging.
1,I am disappointed that these received amazons choice. The nose piece didn't fit my wife or myself. The peripheral vision was very poor. The nose piece actualy cut my nose. Will definitely send back for a refund.
1,smell like rubber
1,This is one of those products to check the negative reviews.  I used these for rowing on a rowing machine.  After half an hour, the parts covering fingers had become bunched up and my fingers were sore and developing calluses.  It's too thin for serious usage and the finger parts really don't hug fingers.		So while it's breathable and lightweight, it was even worse for the skin underneath.
1,What are people using this for?  I wish I had looked on the mfg's website first, I would have seen the picture of the adult and 2 kids sitting on the ground in it.  That's the ONLY way you can use this.  And even an adult sitting in it, on the ground, you legs would be outside of it.  It's useless to me, I had to return it.
1,Does not fit plus tires
1,worked one time, then broke.
1,A little skeptical on whether or not these are actual Amphenol brand. I see some differences in lableing, and the center conductor insulator.
1,shoes were too narrow. Return was very easy.
1,I have other Aeros pillow that is much more comfortable
1,I used this in my .44mag and it got stuck, it actually separated. The outside from the inside core. Very cheap product.
1,A little thin . Not heavy Duty . more Like Pipe wrap that is used to insulate Hot water pipes going to a sink or washtub than Bicycle handlebar grips.	they work though for now .
1,I ordered the XL size,  They are definitely too small and tight around my calf.  I think the material is a bit rough and not soft.  Not sure if it wicked away much sweat.
1,Difficult to use as intended. Couldn't stop it from turning with the die. Ended up threading without it. Needs internal expander capability.
1,Other reviews said to get one size larger. I purchased a large as opposed to a medium, and the mock neck "bacons" as opposed to fitting properly. There is no exchange policy, and to return the item would cost as much as it did to buy. Soooooo, get the size that actually fits, folks...you pay a premium to return it.
1,I'm not going to return this item simply because I can't find the packaging. Make no mistake, though: I shouldn't have bought this tube for one serious resason: I can't get the chemical taste out of my mouth after sipping from the bite valve! It's horrendous. I've tried everything: I've scrubbed it with soap and a pipe cleaner, soaked the valve end in hydrogen peroxide--even alcohol! It's still the scariest taste I've ever experienced, and it won't go away for hours. Whenever I sip while I'm hiking, I feel like I'm ingesting pure carcinogens. Horrible. Don't buy it.
1,This stuff didn't get anything off.	I had to buy MPO7 which worked great. Total waste of money.	It's also a very small container.
1,The Minnesota Vikings pin is a tiny pin, smaller than other official NFL pins. The other problem I have is that the pin is "silver" or nickel or whatever. This is also different than official NFL pins that are "gold" (brass), not to mention that there is no silver in the Minnesota Vikings logo. Raiders? Silver. Vikings? Gold!		Second wrong color, and the thing that bothers me the most, since the color is right in the picture, is that the yellow is completely different on the pin I received. Gold/dark yellow in the picture, bright yellow on the actual pin.		I wouldn't trust this manufacturer, unless you don't care what your team's logo looks like when you get it!
1,I've bought a number of Govivo belts...for family members and everyone loves them.  There are so many uses for this  product...one can use it not just for running, but for a great small hands-free fanny pack that holds a phone, keys, cards, clean doggy poop bags, etc.		Edit:  Ive only had this last belt for a few months (since April 2018!) and strangely,  the elastic has gotten so stretched out its already at the END OF ITS LIFESPAN.  .  Thus when Im wearing it its only minutes before the belt enlarges snd keeps slipping  down. ... and nearly off. It's only been three months!!!  I wish I could get a refund!!! How can I get in contact with Govivo?
1,I purchased these forearm pads for my son who is a Center on his ankle-biter tackle football team.  The pads look great and fit nice, howeverthe straps on the palm side of the pads make it difficult for him to hold onto and hike the ball to the QB.		Would be good for any other lineman, just not the center.
1,Junk
1,Really liked that I might have a shoe cover that would be cost-effective, reliable, and compact.  Not entirely the case.  While the shoe cover does the job it said it would, it should come with the caveat that quality of product might not be uniformly up to snuff.  The left shoe cover worked well while the right shoe cover did not.  Velcro stitching on right shoe cover came loose and zipper broke open under little-to-no strain after only 2 rides.  Left shoe? Dry as a bone.  Right shoe? Better luck next time.  If you buy these, maybe both left and right cover won't break. All I know is that I can't take that gamble gain.		Update:  Went from 2 stars to 1 star.  Show does not hold up well.  Starting to come apart at the seams.  At this rate, it will not make it to March.
1,Poor sawing performance.  It would suffice if it was slow as well as rugged.  But it got stuck in the branch and then snapped as I tried to free it.  So I would not recommend it as even a last resort tool.
1,Not warm enough for 40 degree weather.
1,Zipper caught on the outside material pulling it up.  I got that free and it caught on the inside material pulling it down.  Could not have freed it with cold fingers.
1,This pump is fine for pumping balls with a needle,  but for using on tires it is almost completely useless. When you pull the lever to seal the connection it pushes the valve out and in some cases no amount of effort can prevent this.  Nice quality,  extremely poor design. Mine went in the trash.
1,This is a complicated device and improper use or assembly can expose you to a fatal fall hazard, but it includes no assemby instructions.		Do not buy this unless you have instructions!
1,not what I expected
1,Size too small for my ears. suppose to be for adults, but really small
1,Not much to this- felt it was a waste of money
1,Decent quality just useless sizes.
1,Not worth $45. Both LED lights come on. One is on high and the other is on low. Per the instructions, the first tap puts the primary LED on low output. I have pulled the batteries but the problem still persists. Its a nice idea but not worth the cost. I took a black sharpie and colored the lens to kill the light to where I need it.
1,As normal water bottle. Nothing special.
1,I ordered two of these for my Bug Out Bag... One compass is off by about 30* and the thermometer is in Celsius. Seller also appears to be from China or other Asian country.
1,Bought this same bag on Ebay a few months ago. I noticed small tears in the outer fabric after a couple of bike rides. It began separating at the seams and eventually became unusable because my tools would fall out.		I primarily ride trails with a mountain bike, which does submit this bag to a lot of bumping and rattling. This probably increased the rate of deterioration. Besides that, it was definitely taken care of. Never left out in the sun or rain. I was very surprised how weak the fabric is with this bag. It's certainly not the 'quality' it's advertised to be. I expected it to last much longer.
1,They lie below the wast but not low enough. This means they push up any bit of fat or skin that is there. They fit my stomach with room to spare but the stupid way they lay on the waist make a muffin top. Not just that but they are too short. this causes them to go up you buttcrack and give you a cameltoe in front. If wearing a long, lose s*** it's fine but not if it's form fitting.		I wear a 6 or 4 I am not fat. I have actual hips, not much fat but wider hips. So many companies do not make clothes to fit people with wider hipbones. It makes me feel fat. They have no stretch what so ever which in my opinion is not good for hiking or travel.  I will return it and buy some pants that do not fall on a stupid area of the waist. Dear fashion designers: Stop making clothes for girls with straight bodies. Some people have bigger bones. I am 120 pounds , 5.5. I am not fat but these pants made me feel fat and ugly.  Now, i must order the next size up which will swallow me.
1,What's with the socks on these?  I tried multiple different pairs - medium longs were supposed to max out at a size 10.5.  I wear an 11, and these fit like they were supposed to fit a size 16+.		Wouldn't fit in any wader boots that I have because of the excessive material.
1,Only used it for one day and had to return it because something was moving inside from shot to shot. Couldn't keep a 5" group at 50 yards. To bad because the optics were great.
1,does not stick to all clubs feel cheated
1,Moisture Wicking Silk Touch - no, not so much. This looks and feels like a plain old polo shirt. Far from the moisture wicking silk feeling sports polos of other brands. Very disappointed, completely not what I was hoping/looking for. In addition, the shirt ran about 2 inches slimmer than my other equally-sized polo shirts (laid flat).
1,If you want something tacticool (or zombie-slayer) looking to show your friends or hang on a wall, it is just fine.  If you want to use it and have it last.... not sure how to 'break' this to you... but.. read both the positive and negative reviews.  They can both be true.  It is big and heavy.  I like the blade itself.  However, the blade isn't as useful with a broken handle or reliable sheath to carry it.		Mine arrived with broken handle. The handle was broken during shipping, I assume, and the metal tang is protruding. It is so cheap, I don't want to pay the shipping to send it back and I sure don't want a replacement.  From what I have read (on the comments regarding the replacement sheath question above), the handle will probably break anyway, so I get to start from scratch rather than having it break in my hands in a field!		The sheath itself seems OK. However, the shoulder strap is held with rivets and has a plastic buckle.  I don't see that lasting very long either. If the strap had loops, I would replace it with something thicker and use a metal buckle, but that doesn't look possible.		I contacted Cold Steel about a different sheath. Cold Steel has no other sheath for it. The only sheath replacement I have found so far is custom leather for $150, so that isn't gonna happen either.		I will superglue the handle and tape it up.  I will do what I can to reinforce the strap and adjustment buckle.  Hopefully, it will last long enough that I won't feel like I wasted my money.  In this instance, you do get what you pay for....		I hate to be so negative.  I bought & received two Cold Steel items at the same time and both were very disappointing.  I have never been disappointed with Tramontina or Ka-Bar.  I really wanted to give Cold Steel a shot, but with two strikeouts... I am walking away from Cold Steel forever.
1,Didn't fit our son's BMX bike. Was hoping that one of the adaptors would fit. No luck.
1,yuck.  paper thin.  Doesn't hold up well in hot yoga.  I will use it for something else.
1,Just OK. The overall dimensions were really close. The screwdriver end was useless so I had to file it to the right profile. The back was rough and wasn't sliding on the mag. That took a lot more filing. I bet I filed for 1/2 hour before it was smooth and slid under the mag button properly. A little cold blue and it's almost usable.
1,2 of the props the threads weren't working right
1,I have used a Lobster portable ball machine and a Playmate ball machine for 2 and 5 years, respectively, both personally and with a school tennis team.		The Lobster has complicated touch button controls (instead of dials, knobs, and switches) located low on the back red part of the machine. Absent a remote control, you have to get on your hands and knees to access the controls. And worse, it's difficult to get the machine to produce the desired result from the touch controls: 1) the big problem is that you must pause the machine, 2) then you hit the menu button, then hit up/down keys, 3) you turn it back on to see if you get the result you want.  Often not.  For example, add some spin/speed and balls may shoot off the court. So you have to start the whole process over again trial and error until you get a useable result.		Contrast this with the Playmate's simple dials, knobs, and switches which you can adjust as it shoots balls. It may not sound flashy, but it's much easier to get a desired result by increasing/decreasing feed rate (i.e. seconds between balls being shot), speed of ball, spin, height and oscillation. Also, the controls are located higher on the machine.		The Playmate is a well-made metal machine (not plastic.) Also, I recently needed customer service for a repair, they had my machine up and running in less than a week.		If you are thinking of buying a Lobster machine, think carefully. The Playmate Half-Volley can serve you for years, look nearly new after that period and be resold when not needed.		Generally, I don't write negative reviews, but working with the Lobster machine has been frustrating in contrast to the Playmate.
1,Doesn't stay flat! Just rolls up under the ends I'm even when you lay on it!
1,This thing has turned out to be one very expensive disappointment. It is inconsistent in the way it works, during Wisconsin winter it never rises about 350deg in cold weather. Lots of problems with the fuel hose system shutting it down thinking there was a leak ruining whatever was on the grill. So I bought a new hose. A slight breeze and this thing stops working and if you don't catch it your menu is ruined. In 90deg plus weather it never rises above 425deg. A major fail.
1,would have been cool if it worked..slide etc jams feels and looks real and in concept is great but didn't work out for me and sent back for refund
1,edges of holster were unfinished and sharp.
1,I don't like it. Its too small, doesn't form very well and is outshined in comfort by the cheaper ones out there. I wouldn't buy these ones again.
1,I purchased these socks locally at an REI. I saw the "no blisters guaranteed" across the front of the pack and thought they would be great for the gym. Admittedly, I took time for a heavy work out some weights and then 6 miles on the treadmill, but still, it was a slow 6 miles, I enjoyed 2 hours of the gym's TV while I leisurely strolled - I was not running - I was walking and, according to the package, these are good for "Running/Trail/Hiking/Multisport", so I was expecting better.		Even though they failed to forfill their promise of "no blisters", I plan to keep them because they are comfortable and will work fine as week day socks to wear when I'm NOT working out or walking long distances.
1,Despite the visual presence of padding these gloves don't provide that much comfort. My cheapo performance cycling gloves were better.
1,Do not buy! Returns are to Germany and it costs over 100$ to send it back. It fits like a square sheet boxy and huge
1,The tip's ceramic insert came loose after a few casts. After that, I examined all guides and noticed they are very flimsy comparing to Daiwa and Okuma rods. I would not recommend this product to anyone that does frequent fishing. The only good thing about this rod was light weight and ergonomic handle. But what good does it make if it can't last.	Since I love the light weight, nice handle that fits my hand perfectly and a very good tip action, I think I am going to give it another shot. Hopefully, the first one was just defective out of production.
1,BUYER BEWARE!!! I have a C410 which still works great. So naturally I thought the R450 would be the same type of quality only with upgraded features. If you read the 1 start comments they are true. I should have reviewed them prior to purchasing this model. I am now on my third replacement watch through Amazon. Amazon has of course been excellent in this matter. The issue is with the product. The first two would only sync once with my devices. After that, both the watches stopped syncing. I performed a master reset, and still nothing. The lifetrak app when it comes to this type of issue is useless. You cant remove the watch from the app. You cant access Lifetrak via the web to remove the watch.		Now, when it comes to a company standing behind their product, do not look to Lifetrak for help. You will be very lucky to even contact customer/Technical support. Their phone number listed on their site, and their users manual is either busy, or you have to leave a message. I even sent them an email. 5 days later, no response. And like another reviewer wrote, when I did get a hold of them out of frustration they would only offer a replacement if I shipped the defective one to them. Which is fine but it would take weeks to get a new one.		If you do want to try your luck with this model, be sure to buy it through Amazon, as they will support you were Lifetrak will not.
1,No comment
1,Did not fit my camelBak water bottle.  However, Amazon customer service is a 5+ star
1,They emailed a return label. But not all of us have a printer to print label. Not pleased with product sizing. And problems on return.
1,I received this Elliptical last week and put it together, the unit has mis-matched stepper arms. The right is almost 3" shorter then the other and there's no serial number on the unit.  There are also two broken plastic parts. Im wondering if this is a reworked machine and if thats why it was on sale? Customer service is sending new parts hopefully those fit! Think twice before you order, you may get a piece  of Junk!
1,oder one size larger...okay product, but not impressed.
1,I bought these for the smooth stem (unthreaded).  It turns out these tubes are threaded for the whole length of the stem.  Only the thinner road bike tubes in this brand come with smooth bodied stems.
1,The quality was just not there it cast out ok but Broke the first time I hooked a trout on it.
1,This is not worth the price. You can't fill it with the sleeve on, so filling it is not convenient and the plastic does leave a taste in the water. I left water in it for a couple hours (was out) and used it and there's a definite bad taste. It would be okay for about 1/3-/12 the price, but I'd never recommend this for the price.
1,Not sure if ours were damaged in transit or just super fragile but I ordered two and both leaked air when we took them out to use... the air valves look like this. FIRST time out of the bag... returning tomorrow.
1,This is very flimsy built. You could never chip ice with it. It will make a good dipper but that is all.
1,The 2 stars applies to the listing and not enough product info.  (no size stated) They come in 2 sizes. Small & Large	The product itself is great. I have a set on my Salsa Mukluk 3. They protect the crank arms very well. BUT  be sure you order the right size!!!  These are too big to fit the SLX cranks on my Kona 29'er.
1,I recived this item and the dial wouldnt spin at first. Then I got it to work properly, but was still not happy with it. It's impossible to sight a bearing with the thing. Spend the money and buy something else. I sent it back.
1,I took these to the range with much anticipation, but was greatly disappointed with their performance. I have a pair of browning muffs rated at 26dBs. The Sensgard  surprised me with their lack of surpressing the loud and ringing noise produced by my 9MM. I followed the instructions on how to place these in your ears, and I repeated these steps a number of times. I do not believe the claims of 31dBs. My suggestion to a potential buyer is do not buy these if you want to protect your hearing. This is the first item I have returned to Amazon, and they offer a great return process, in making it easy for me to return this item.
1,Pros:	- Looks good.	- Handle has a nice finish to it.	- Good weight.		Cons:	- Blade is prone to rust.	- Broke at the thin point (roughly half-inch or so above the top of the hilt) upon moderate force and minimal resistance (vine chopping, quarter to half inch branches).	- Handle needs some form of texture to keep from slipping.		In short: Looks good, performs horribly.  Don't waste your money.
1,I like that the light can be recharged but that's about all it has going for it. The clips are made of a brittle plastic, I don't think they'll hold up to repeated removal from your hat.  The leds are a older version and don't put out much light.  Spent half the cost of the light returning it.  My search continues....
1,It's ok made in China
1,Great concept.  Perfect accept one thing. The zippers suck. Every zipper broke. If they can fix this would be supper cool design.
1,Cheap product. . Not very accurate. . Stopped functioning after few months.
1,Total junk.
1,Got the item put it together very easy to put together and I thought hey what a great price cheaper by about 15.00 bucks cool!! Well not cool it ended up breaking on the second spool didn't even get to finish it!!!
1,I really liked the look of this chair.  It is light and easy to carry from the car to the bleachers.  I bought one for my husband and one for me.  The second time my husband used his, one of the buckles broke on the back support.  I really do like this chair, but it is frustrating that it would break so easy.  I think we can rig something up to fix it, but I don't think it will be as good and I don't think the buckle should have snapped so easily.
1,It got hard to quick did not have time to mold into shape. Also I bought another one at a acadmey , it did not get hard at all , in fact it dripped down my ear and it took three days to get it out. NO GOOD
1,The straw came out right away. We still use it but have to unscrew the top.
1,I bought this over Park brand for pedal removal because of price, 5 star rating and description. Returning it because in the description it states the 15mm being 11" long and it is not even close. It was not even 8" long. To short for leverage to remove pedals, it is shorter than my 15mm wrench out of my tool box.	Guess I should had read the reviews instead of just going by rating. I read reviews after I bought it because I was trying to figure out what people are using this for and it appears it is not to remove BICYCLE pedals. Even one person said they would not use it on pedals. Huh? The item is listed as Pedro"s BICYCLE cone wrench and almost all road bike pedals are 15mm.
1,these insulated water bottles work well and keep the fluids cold.  Notice I said water, DO NOT PUT ANYTHING INSIDE EXCEPT WATER!  The liner stains and absorbs color and flavors easily.  To make things worse, the inside has pencil eraser sized dimples which make it near impossible to clean drink mix.  At most I got 2-3 months use before I had to toss it because the inside was moldy and gross.
1,Weak and s***ty. I don't know the point. Not for real exercise. Joke. Buy good ones instead.
1,I bought this hatchet a few years ago.  We use it a few times each camping season to split already split wood for the campfires.  It has worked well up to this point, as it's never been heavily used, nor abused ever.  Yesterday I split several pieces of dry pine wood, and on the third piece the handle completely snapped.  I would understand if the I'd abused it, but the handle obviously had some sort of defect in the plastic material.  My advice, if you want to buy something like this once, go get an all metal one, like the Estwing.
1,Had to return could not get it to work
1,Been using about a month. Hit a small pothole, the handles flew up and unlatched, basket fell forward into front tire. Not a pretty sight. Never mind that the basket is totaled, and the bike is damaged. I have broken thumb, broken arm, AND 23 STITCHES ON MY LEG. Did have a skid lid on, thank goodness.  If you have good medical, buy it.
1,Pulls loose from waist band
1,I wear a 9.5R.  Per the instructions in the description I ordered the next larger size.  I just received the boots and they are too big. A note on the boots states that the boots are suppose to be large to allow for foot swelling when wet.  If you intend to use the boots as dry work boots I would suggest getting one size smaller.  I am going to request an exchange for a size smaller and will report my results. Photo of note attached.
1,light don't work and hard to close back together. but stunner works.
1,Be aware that the first line of the instructions warns to keep the watch away from moisture.  Trail rugged?  Maybe in Arizona.  Also the second line says to keep away from magnets.  Guess it won't like my golf bracelet too much either.  Plus you will need a degree in software engineering and deciphering gibberish to make heads or tails of the instructions.
1,Subpar, not very study. The kids played with it one time and now it's just collecting dust
1,Lousy product. Batteries connectors don't connect well and comes loose easily.		i bought 8 for a Death Valley race and out of which only 6 were working. They are brand new from the pack!		Do not buy this product.
1,Could not run with them. I got a horrible chafing
1,Cool pattern but thin and loose. Not much compression. I'll stick with Under Armour next time.
1,This swivel is poorly designed and does not allow the speed bag to swing freely.  The old model was much better.  Avoid. Other speed bag swivels perform much better.
1,These pants are HUGE!  Returned f
1,These fit REALLY small... I ordered two sizes up and that works best.
1,GOT RIGHT SIZE , BUT ORDERED 2 OF THE SAME SHIRTS AND GOT 2 (DIFFERENT) SHIRTS , SAME TEAM BUT NOT THE SAME SHIRT
1,very thin, easily pop open if you can even get them to snap shut. not a good product at all. highly disappointed in these
1,After trying to attach it to my car trailer hitch rack, I could not find a way to mount it successfully.	The quality of the product is good and if you have a way to mount it you will like it.
1,mold accumulates readily in both the removable cap and the top (inside) of the start of the straw.  Nearly impossible to clean well by hand.  Might work if you have a dishwasher but more hassle than the worth of 'spill proof'.  Note that every time you remove the lid to refill, with the attached straw, water will run out the straw (be over a sink or the like!)
1,Once past 10x everything was out of focus. I bough it for a trip to Yellowstone, it was worthless.......I returned it. While in Yellowstone I tried many other brands and all were better than this.
1,I ordered two boxes and when I compared them with my jsb exact jumbo heavy 18gr, the 18gr pellets went deeper than the monster ones, also they group better (see picture). I used my Benjamin armada for the test, I called amazon and they return my money and I ordered more of the 18gr.	The Top target in the picture shows 5 shoots widely spread ( monster), the bottom target shows 5 shots one over the other (18gr jsb). My rifle is calibrated at 25yards and it is extremely accurate at that distance.
1,not exactly what i was hoping for.  thought would be more padded for male anatomy.  jacks manufacturing makes a good one for my english jump saddle
1,Sock fits OK but I have developed an allergy to neoprene, especially neoprene from China.
1,Total crap, get what you pay for. Would not align correctly with end of Trijon and would always fall off!!
1,Picture looks great but doesn't work. Zipper cannot open when the bike bar is in the way
1,I take spin classes, and sweat a lot. I've been using traditional cotton terry headbands to keep sweat out of my eyes. After a ride, the terry headband is quite moist. Based on the reviews, I thought this headband might wick the sweat away. Instead, it got completely saturated with sweat 20 minutes in to the 45 minute workout. It was sopping wet, and sweat was just passing through it. I'll go back to the terry sweatbands.
1,Traded in my Bushnell for this thinking if could get the job done. I am the only person with the "magic touch" to use this thing - had it for about 2 years and have slowly grown to hate it. You get what you pay for - nothing is more frustrating than blasting one 40 yards over because you relied too heavily on a poorly made piece of equipment. Ultimately, I blame myself for buying this, please don't make the same mistake.
1,I would give 5 stars for these pants, but the fact that they don't offer a 29" waist really pisses me off. They go 28",30", and then all the sudden offer 31, 33, 35.... How many slim fit yogis, hikers, climbers, whatever, are there out there who would want a 29 x 30 or even 29 x 32? I bet you there's a heluva lot of em! Not going smaller than 28" I can kinda understand because after that your pretty much talking kids clothes, but not offering the 29" waist is a mistake.
1,Boots were well-made but size was too large for my leg. Contact Teeter to confirm the leg size recommended for this boot and for their smaller 'blue' boot.
1,Junk, on my first tire replace the plastic tool broke it. And the tools dismantled.
1,It did not fit properly.(returned)
1,Shaft came bent.
1,Too  small, poor quality.  I camped in Hawaii and it was very uncomfortable.  I am only 5'5" and it was too small.
1,Total garbage, This has no therapeutic value for cooling the body or even using in a cooler.
1,I opened the box, put in the brand new Duracell batteries, tried in vain to decipher the tiny print in the "manual", and the virtually illegible tiny grey on grey words next to the buttons. Finally found the manual in a PDF online.	So I set the switch to "IR" as the manual said.  Light  flashed but took no pictures. After a minute or so it turned itself off and no amount of movement  makes the red light flash again. So I re-reads the manual.	AHA!!	It says the light will flash when motion is detected, but nothing about taking any pictures. Apparently you can only set it to "time delay", which I finally deduced means time between pictures. I don;t want that. I want it to take a photo when it sees some movement.  Why in blazes would anyone want to sift through 10,000 photos to find the one that actually shows any action???	I'm beyond 'disappointed". I'm fed up with shoddy manufacturers that foist totally unusable electronic CRAP on the poor unsuspecting consumer AND CAN'T TAKE THE TROUBLE TO WRITE A MANUAL THAT MAKES ANY SENSE.
1,I'll do a little pro/con list and then elaborate	Pros:	-Very well made leather sheath. it's a great fit, the stitching is excellent, and the leather is quality	-The blade itself seems pretty solid and comes relatively sharp out of the box	-It's a pretty good looking knife and looks just like it's pictured		Cons:	-NOT Damascus steel as advertised (see below)	-The tang (I don't think it's full tang, but I can't be sure so I won't say it's definitely not) is pencil thin, maybe half an inch.	-The handle isn't put together well and it's uneven and causes irritation where the gold rings are		Damascus explanation: This may not be acid etched, but it's definitely not Damascus. I have multiple Damascus steel knives that were actually hand made and this is definitely just some kind of etching. I have attached pics comparing the two. For starters, if the pattern on Damascus is round/wavy on one side, it should be basically straight on the perpendicular side (aka the spine, see pic 2). Such is not the case on this knife, though without too many flat sides, it's hard to notice if you're not looking closely. Also, you can clearly see in several places where they didn't take the etching to the edge of the metal and it's just smooth and shiny (see pic 5). Just to further my theory, i took some metal polish and rubbed a tiny spot on the blade for all of 10 seconds and already could see signs of the etching smoothing out (pic 3).		If this were a $20 knife, I'd say sure, pick it up as a display piece. If you are expecting actual Damascus steel and a knife you can actually use, this is not the knife for you. I knew I was taking a risk buying an $80 knife that should cost a minimum of $200 and upwards of $500 depending on the maker and whatnot, but I didn't realize it would be this crappy. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because it was only $80. Had it been over $100, it would get 1 star for sure. Even at $20 though, I'd give it 3 stars at best.
1,Purchased late last winter and started loading .44 magnum. the powder measure was impussible to dial in 100%, but I found using the trickler allowed for precision even though it takes longer to weigh every load. This fall i began loading .380 auto and .45 acp. The powder measure randomly locks up mid-stroke when dialed down to 7 grains or less. Sometimes i can load 50+ rounds with no problems, others i cannot load one. The lockup will prevent the handle from moving for a random number of "jiggles", sometimes coming free after a couple movements, sometimes taking a minute or more. Actual amount of powder does not seem to be affected by the lock up of the mechanism.	the powder measure arrived completely dissasembled. I cleaned it with warm, soapy water and thoroughly dried the parts. Assembly was not easy, but seemed correct when used for 9+ grains of powder for the .44s. RCBS customer service said the unit should have arrived assembled and that i needed a small load cylinder. Provided documentation shows the measure in a dissasembled state. Provided documentation does not show this kit requiring additional parts to load hand gun cartridges. Advertising is to the contrary and states it works with all calibers, .22 to .50...RCBS customer service was confusing as they instantly replaced a hand primer rod that was indenting the primers slightly without any questions but refused to help with this issue unless i shell out more money. their representative's attitude was terrible and refused to provide the part supposedly required to fix the problem without charging for the part and shipping. The guy wanted to talk more than provide solutions and wasted more than 20 minutes of my time before i gave up, (which i suspect was his aim all along). If RCBS does not fix this issue i will not purchase their brand of gear or recommend their equipment to anyone again.
1,Arrived with the bottom broken off. I glued it back, too much trouble to return
1,The soft sided shot gun case arrived in a very strong grey plastic shipping bag. The case was turned inside out, and bent backwards in the bag and folded in half. The gun case was not damaged but it does have a firm crease in the foam padding now. When I wrote my review about the shipping, in OutdoorBunker's feed back, OutdoorBunker's customer service contacted me and gave me $5.oo for my trouble and asked me if I would remove my review, telling me that it was packed that way by the manufacture, and not them. I really find that hard to believe but $5 dollars is $5 dollars. It is funny but now I can not get back into OutdoorBunker's web sight to leave a second review. What do you think, was it the seller or the manufacture that sent me a normally flat shot gun case inside out and bent over back wards in a plastic bag? I bought 6 gun cases from OpticsPlanet and never had a problem and none of them come in a plastic bag. Looks like someone was trying to save some packaging cost<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/SCOPE-READY-GUN-CASE-42-L-X-13-H-Black/dp/B001OLVHME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">SCOPE-READY GUN CASE (42"L X 13"H)/Black</a>. Maybe I should have held out for $15.
1,The seat cover I received is not the one pictured.  Furthermore, the cover I received is foam, not gel.  If you do spin, you know how much you sweat on that bike.  Foam soaks up this sweat, and then 3 hours later this seat cover smells like sweat.  Sweat from your bum no less.  I'm returning it to get my money back, but honestly considered burning it because of the smell.
1,Didn't fit my golf cart, sent it back, I can't seem to find a cover that fits mine as my roof doesn't extend back over the rear seats.  If anyone knows of another that fits one like this please let me know.
1,i must say how dissapointed i am of these shoes,,,  i ridden them not more than 8 times and they're allready starting to break,,,,tried to contact dealer and never got a response,,, no wonder they cost so cheap!!!! and i guess that sums it up CHEAP !!!!!! i will never recomend these shoes
1,Bill is too long and heavy to wear and the fan is very weak and does not cool at all.
1,I have tried to like this mat - really.  I use it for hot yoga, which I don't think it is supposed to be used for anyhow.  I slip often - I find it hard to clean - it is very heavy.  I like the whole concept that it is natural and doesn't leave a significant environmental footprint but it just did not work for me.
1,Good idea, poorly executed.		I bought this to solve a simple problem. Resting my shorter rifles in my gun cabinet. Product looks beefy in photos, but is really just hollow plastic. I can live with that, but after only a few days use I opened my cabinet to find it lying in he bottom with the magnetic strip still attached to the cabinet wall. All this thing is is a plastic rest with a sticky tape magnet strip holding it to whatever metal surface you put it on. I bought it so I didn't have to make one myself,  but instead still had to repair it with gorilla glue. It will work now, but for the money paid I shouldnt have had to do ANYTHING to improve it. Just more cheapie Chinese crap in my opinion. Wouldnt buy again.
1,They do not work or I cannot get they to work
1,Small bag as noted, but big enough for essentials. Very cheaply made with cheap fabric. You can find this same product in Chinatown or Koreantown for much less.
1,hardware was not complete
1,I got this and took it out kayaking.  After about 6 miles of paddling It broke at the clip.  I lost my paddle.  Not a fun time.
1,didn't last very long. The kid already broke it off and lost it
1,nice and lightweight, but the zippers stick a lot of the time, and it's hard to get them loose.  I end up doing a lot of messing around/wasting time with zippers when using this backpack.
1,<div id="video-block-R263A98QQNCJSK" class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block"></div><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1I6L9A7WMS.mp4" class="video-url"><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81L3CUpW8US.png" class="video-slate-img-url">&nbsp;I purchased this tent because the description stated that no rainfly was needed and truth be told I was tired of dealing with rainflys. Tents should be waterproof from the factory. This tent was not waterproof at all. The reviews that say things like "I sprayed it with a garden hose" and give it 5 stars before they even USE it should not be allowed. The middle of the tent was soaked because even though the top vents have covers (that were closed) they allow enough moisture to get in that it collects on the screen and drips. The bottoms of the walls were also pooling with water from windows. Also, when you open the door the water that collects above the door drains into the tent. If we had not had the tent on a platform I am sure the bottom of the our mattress would have been soaked. BUY A TARP OR RAINFLY FOR THIS TENT. I am guilty of having many expensive electronics along with me on "rustic" camping trips and if you share my guilt do not make the same mistake I did. My laptop was in the fifth wheel camper or else it would have been destroyed. My clothes and battery chargers were damp but not harmed. I have purchased a tarp and seemsealer for the tent so hopefully I can waterproof it. I do feel this tent is designed well other than the problems with leaking. It sets up in less than 60 seconds and they give you a big bag to put the tent back into so that takes maybe a minute once you get all the air out. I would give this tent 5 stars if it came with a rainfly and did not make false claims.
1,The connectors to the earpieces are too big and hurt my ears after a few hours.
1,I just received mine.  I like the texture and color, but MAN they SMELL strongly like a refinery.  The odor is *not* a wool odor (I'm familiar with that from other wool products) or even a "new polyester" odor, but more like a gas station.  I couldn't get that odor out after 2 washes and now they're airing out in my garage (which now smells like an oil spill).  I believe this could be flame retardant based on the label.  It could even be the dye.  I would like to know what they put in these blankets.  If the odor doesn't diminish or I don't figure out a way to wash out whatever chemicals are causing this, I may have to return them :-(  They're made in India so that also makes me wonder about quality control vis a vis applied chemicals, what dyes are used, and so forth.
1,The Nikon P series mount is well made but it did not fit on my Picatinny rail on my Bushmaster M4A3. Be very leary on this mount.
1,Purchased binoculars in August and by March the focusing screw had stripped.  They worked well until the screw stripped and now they can't be focused.
1,Go try these out at your local Field and Stream first, I wasn't impressed.  A little bulky and sharp edges. Maybe it would have broken in but I wanted something slimmer and smoother so I ended up returning this product.
1,There's slimy sticky coating even when frozen solid. It's not pleasant to touch and I don't want to put it in with my food. What's up with that?		VERY disappointed.
1,Don't but this is not the same yo yo you remember as a kid that would drag a boat out the water, these say made in U.S.A that's a dam lie and if they are made in the u.s.a they went to chine to learn how to make them,this is a joke I bought 12 what a waste, I readied the feed back these people don't know what a real yo yo is .if you buy just get 1 or 2 so you won't be so disappointed.they Suck
1,Kind of weak I drilled and taped the bottom to make a fixed stop screw . Would recommend this for airsoft or 22 pistols just not strong enough . Might be ok for 380 or 9mm wouldn't try on a 40. Side set screw will damage your rail on your gun if your not careful.
1,Very slippery. Have to wet it several times during practice. Annoying
1,These cheezy companies keep selling these dawf target systems.  FACT: This target system is short, picture the top of the target backboard reaching about the belly button of a 5 foot 10 inch man.  If you are shooting prone position maybe it would be good enough.  But for standing and practicing self defense or target shooting...do NOT waste your time!		TWO stars because this thing MIGHT find use to some people...but not what most shooters want.
1,The technology to get the product is beyond my capabilities, and I don't see any instructions.  One star for making me feel dumb about going to YouTube to watch a video on how to get the product out.
1,great backup sound signal device.
1,Too large and quality of the shirt was disappointing. However rather than wearing it socially I will wear it for gardening. It's all good.
1,WORTHLESS.  NON-FUNCTIONAL.  LOOKS GOOD BUT WASTE OF MONEY!.
1,Cheaply made product. Cannot fasten. Bulbs died after one day of use...speechless.
1,this cue ball chipped the 3rd time we used it.  Don't waste your money on this product.
1,Had higher hopes for this.  I envisioned a quick process of pointing in the barrel and turning.  Even after a few YouTube videos and studying the pathetic enclosed instructions, I struggled mightily with my Kimber and finally took out my cheap 1911 tool and had it disassembled in seconds.  The Avid tool just got tossed on the shelf, never to be used again.  Sigh.  I hate it when you buy something so useless and yet is too inexpensive to bother returning.
1,I have a PRESTA Valve on my bike...it does NOT work as its suppose to.  I have to manually hold the valve fitting in order for it to take air.		Good Idea Great Price but not Good...I find it pretty disappointing the "BELL" would actually sell garbage like this.
1,I am very disappointed in this tape.  Due to its thickness it is very hard to keep the end caps in (I have locking end caps that tighten down with allen head screws) as they simply pop out and the tape comes unraveled.
1,Shirt runs very small.
1,OK
1,Did not arrive with a canteen cup!  So what does a person do to get it really pisses me off.
1,Absolutely useless to me. It is so tight that I can't even use these as elbow pads. Did I get the toddler version of knee pads? Because these certainly won't fit an adult.
1,It's ok
1,This product is good. but the packaging where it came from was too large and the cost of traveling to panama was very expensive. Must improve to pack the product. Something as compact
1,Not that good. Not sure where all of these fake reviews are coming from. For 20 there are way better options. This thing is worth 5. Got it free when buying a charger. Anyway the latern is very hard to collapse open and closed. Led however is decently bright, but overall just nothing special
1,Hook and drier don't work with my camelbak maximum gear. Not heavy enough to use as paperweights so it is now trash decoration.
1,This snapped in two this morning when I was using it leaving a large red welt on my shoulder.  I purchased this one month ago and have been using it 5 days a week.
1,The rail is a great product but it wouldn't stay on the gun because of the rounded edge. So after using a file for about 30min trying to flaten the rounded edge it still wouldent fit the gun is wider than the claws so after flatening the edge it still grab on. But the rail click into place some how for a quick second but even the recoil of a 22 kicks it of zero. Im just going to get the real one for 100 bucks of there web sight cause this is the second type of rail I've gotten and they just don't work.  So just get the real one and save time.
1,Too small for most scopes.
1,Two main issues:		1. Its a very soft saddle, and it's wide at the back. If you mountain bike often you will not like giving up control. The comfort is mostly perception in my opinion, it's soft, sure, but on impact you bone will not hold on the seat and your boys will.		2. With all seats its important to keep in mind that there are many ways to mount them. I generally lower the nose on my saddle. Well, because the gel raises the seat you can't angle the saddle (at least on my bike).		Bonus side issues I'm not rating on--it looks kind of ugly.		A saddle is a personal thing and amazon reviews is about hearing people's experience on a product. As for my take, I would not recommend this product.		-- UPDATE: August 9, 2012		I ended up going with the Koobi SI Classic. It's a FANTASTIC saddle, also gel--great for serious mountain biking. The Koobi is made in Italy whereas this seat, the Planet Bike 5020, is made in China. If you like the 5020, that is great, but I can almost GUARANTEE you do not mountain bike long technical trails; nothing wrong with that, and it's not what it's for; but if you do, God bless you. As for the Koobi, its build quality is way and above the Planet Bike 5020, well worth the retail price difference.
1,Pros:	Strong build, survived several drops intact	Cons:	Leaks as much as the brittat and the KOR.	The spout is not protected, which depending on the person and the places might be OK.
1,No instructions on how to use.	Missing 2 collets.	Returned.
1,Doesn't feel like it supports anything. Just feels like a sock with a hole cut out for heel. I wouldn't buy again and neither should you. There are better products out there for sure.
1,Not impressed,  returned and bought my fitbit
1,This pot is advertised as a pot for camp cooking, however the instruction booklet specifically states it is for carrying food only and not to be put on direct flame! The bottom of the pot is thin metal. This is the type of light weight product you find in Chinese grocery stores. Not for long term use.
1,Meh....
1,2 out of the 6 didn't even point north and they have a very cheap feel.  I know button compasses are generally a last ditch item but it would have been nice if they could have at least pointed north somewhat accurately.
1,I bought this product, got one nalgene bottle out of it, before it completely clogged.  I tried cleaning it with the sponge it comes included with, and that helped, temporarily.  The problem seems to be that the valve that is supposed to keep the water from going back out the intake tube, was defective.  You SQUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEZE so hard (the pump is VERY hard to push)only to have a drop come out the bottom, and all the rest go back out into the stream.		Another person with the exact same, brand new filter, offered to let me use his.  The same thing happened!!!  Luckily, there was someone along with a Pur filter and we all just had to use hers.  This would have left us for 3 days in the wilderness with no water if we had just relied on this filter.  UNACCEPTABLE for a product like this!!!		I returned it, and will go get a Pur filter.  The woman who let us use her Pur filter said everyone she knows who uses this filter has problems with it.  Strange, because all other MSR products are so good.  I wonder if there was a manufacturing defect with this latest batch, since both of us had bought it new, and had the same problem.  Who knows.  Anyway, i would give this zero stars if it was possible.
1,I used this net for the first time today after ordering it almost 3 years ago.  Setup was ok, not great.  Much easier with 2 people (as the instructions recommends).  I hit a bunch of 7-9 irons into it.  Then I teed up a driver and first drive ends up going right through the net and then who knows where.  really disappointed that this didn't hold and now I can't send it back because it has been too long.  8-(
1,DO NOT BUY THIS.  the application for the 315 is no longer updated.  I could not transfer my files yesterday 5/5/18 but could on Wednesday 5/2/18.  no tcx, gpx or fit files to be found in the database.  very upsetting that i've only had this device for less than a year and its money down the drain.  If I could give negative stars I would.
1,All the hype is terribly tainted with misleading results of ice retention. I experienced a puddle of water in the bottom in less than 24 hours. Just buy one of the name brand hard sided coolers instead. I got this from the warehouse deals and it was missing the top tray. Called manufacturer and they sent out a new one for me. Good for them.
1,Only worked for a few seconds.  Nice idea if it works.  Maybe just got a defective one.
1,doesn't count all my steps. Poorly made . Waste of money.
1,Did not work well for me. Got an ugly birds nest right after filling my new reel hand setting my drag,
1,Easy to mount, and ,sight in,liked the illumination, but blurry in higher numbers, could not make out target at 100yds, in 9x, focusing did not help.
1,Not good
1,Very weak material, took me 2 weeks to rip them apart. Don't waste your money. Cheap isn't good in this case.
1,I have a 29 inch waist and these are too tight. I have a butt, I lift! please make clothing fit right for women. It doesn't have to be skin tight. I wish I would have bought a large, but alas they do not have free shipping so forget it.
1,Bristles started falling out after one use.
1,So the wallet is nice and fits a lot of cards. But I've only had it for 2 days so time will tell. But I'm disappointed that after purchasing it on amazing I find Vanquest sells it cheaper on there website and I could get military discount thru them on there site. I I spent a extra $7 thru Amazon and it says sold my Vanquest. Not a happy customer and I just recently purchased the sling v3.0 bag luckily I bought it thru there website
1,I had high hopes, but I was disappointed. Clay disc kept falling out before launch. The disc didn't go far or have any elevation by itself. Even when I added a lot of tension, it just wasn't going anywhere. In fact, I ended up buying a hand thrower at the range and I got a lot more elevation, range and fun out of that.		A recommendation to the company is to put a handle or something to help cock the swing arm.
1,Okay.  I love the flag.  Well made and they work fine on the car.  What I had forgotten from using these types of flags on my former SUV years ago, is that they mess up the rubber molding on the top of the window frame.  The flag's plastic attachment to the window basically permanently bent the rubber molding.  Luckily the window closes completely and no air or water (when it rains) get through.  The seal seems to be intact.  My advice is to buy a number sticker or window decal instead.
1,Didnt care much for the product
1,Not for 25.4mm stem, handlebar end does measure out for 25.4mm
1,Had to crunch it to get on ended returning it. Have others (older original Century) and they fit fine. Not so with this one. Returned it.
1,hard to get it to go on
1,Rust buildup after 6 days of use. Face mask broke from hat and unable to reattach.
1,Didn't come close to fitting my G26 Gen 4.
1,This is a toy. Its a blow up bag. If you hit it hard enough you can hit the pole in the middle. This isn't for someone who actually wants to box. Terrible. Wouldnt recommend this cheap product.
1,Have not had these installed for a year and the wire leads are coming loose where they enter the led light strip.  Have tried to get them wiggled around to where they come on and then glue them in place but that is not working any more.  not happy.
1,Sometimes a little savings doesn't make up for a relative drop in quality.  In my experience this holds true for the Tool Logic SLPLY.  While I know it's not trying to be a true copy of the ubiquitous Leatherman (there's greater focus on the blade and less on the accompanying tools), the fact of the matter is that both occupy the same functional sphere.  So I forgive how much smaller (and flimsier) the pliers are, and I can get over just how small (bordering on unusably small, for typical screws) the screw heads are.  What's harder to swallow is how the main focus of the tool (the knife itself) is just poorly executed.  Most notably is the locking mechanism, which requires two hands and some real effort with the tip or side of your thumb in order to disengage the lock in order to close the blade.  Don't misunderstand, a locking mechanism should be safety first, and convenience second, but disengaging the lock isn't a matter of convenience -- it's just plain difficult.		Construction is underwhelming.  The tool doesn't feel 'safe' or sturdy.  Maybe I've been spoiled by my&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Leatherman-830850-Skeletool-CX-Multitool/dp/B000XU43IC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Leatherman 830850 Skeletool CX Multitool</a>, and it's not at all lost on me that you can have two of these for less than the cost of one of those.  But there are cheaper Leathermans (such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Leatherman-830032-Blast-Multitool-with-Leather-Sheath/dp/B0002H49BW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Leatherman 830032 Blast Multitool with Leather Sheath</a>, and they're still going to be more solidly constructed, more functional, longer lasting, and safer (at least in terms of feel).		I came away disappointed, and couldn't recommend this over the marginally costlier options above.
1,Beat up, distorted, oval shaped instead of round.  Maybe 1/3 of the pellets are actually usable.
1,Did not work for a m&p 9mm Pro nor Springfield XDM 9mm. Maybe it was just me, but I don't think so. Just breakdown and get a quality holster that you know will work.
1,Changed my rating. I am not sure if this is a real Swiss Army Knife. Why? Well the wine opener broke on first try. Hmmm. Might be a fake.
1,Are you kidding? This has to be one of the worst pieces of crap i ever bought. I have always used GERBER knives and multi-tools for the last 20 years in the army. They have always been outstanding tools that take a lot of abuse and I  have always loved the fact Gerber has a life time warranty they stand by and made in America. However, having said that. This new bear Grylis line of products is just pure crap. The quality of build is horrible and the sheath is absolutely pure junk. The sheath digs into your hip and theres no way to adjust it not to. Its absolute garbage. Oh did i mention its made overseas too> No surprise there. Soon as they come out with a product line that isn't made in America the quality went down the drain . I am very disappointed in Gerber for producing this garbage.
1,Dont bother buying these if you bought the gun brand new. These are same as the one that comes with it.
