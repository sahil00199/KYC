0,WoW this thing does an amazing job. we have a yellow lab and I thought that we would kill the vac in the first week. Nope!!! just like the  energizer bunny it keeps going and going!!!  Just keep the filter clean.
0,Working great. Magnet on back is prone to falling off or breaking. Easy fix though.
0,Ordered this to assemble a small field laboratory kit. It was delivered in 2 days along with one of the other 13 ordered items.  Thick, high-quality glass. The stem is sturdy and will be perfect for Erlenmeyer flasks and test tubes. I hope all the other ordered glassware.is as well made!
0,The screws are fairly high quality screws, from a brand that I've seen on the shelves at the local hardware stores. There aren't a lot of screws in the kit. The kit has a good selection of screws, containing enough to get you by for a repair or 2, if you're using one size. I've already used about half the kit. But, it's a nice assortment to have, so I've ordered another one.
0,Boom it's stuck, after a certain amount of dry down.
0,very useful and strong
0,For secure, higher power, removeable connection this is the gold standard
0,Just right for my husband's fencing chores . . . exactly what he wanted - old fashioned fencing tool.  We would recommend this product to a friend.
0,nice to have around- different colors for different wires!
0,Works really well.
0,Worked great with a heavy duty shop vacuum and kept me off of a ladder. Very good for us older folks.
0,Amazing Hold!
0,Works well. Gives an accurate temperature and humidity reading. No complaints.
0,Sent as shown.  Worthy of trust.
0,This set is easy to set-up and seems fairly durable. If you have limited space available and the four 12" x 24" size pegboard panels fit nicely, go for it if you like the color. The black may look cool yet if you place them on a garage wall they may darken the area more than originally intended - at least that's my personal opinion since my garage windows are very small. As an alternative I prefer the large white 4'x8' wooden pegboards available at various home-fix stores, as they blend much better with light colored walls.
0,A must-have in the workshop.  This was a good price on the quantity and the "self-tappers" work well.
0,This Gorilla guess doesn't need to be moistened with water to activate before setting up like the brown stuff does.  You can either rus  squeeze a drop then spread with the brush, or just use the brush. I only use Gorilla products. It's the best...from their duct tape to the super glue. Never fails.
0,Great product!
0,good to have around the home and shop
0,I replaced the dealer-provided screws on my car's license plate bracket with these screws. The old screws were 1/4" self-tapping screws and these screws seem to have the same thread pattern, so there was no new cutting of threads. I feel safer knowing that there's at least some degree of protection to my license plates, which do get stolen in some areas.
0,This made attaching 4"x4"x10' lumber to my concrete slab a breeze. They're a little pricey, but they are very well made from heavy gauge steel that is welded together and powder coated. Also, everything is pre-drilled. The convenience and ease of use makes these well worth the price.
0,great product!
0,Exactly what I needed without buying a lot
0,My husband collects rolls of tape for various purposes and this is one of his favorites. Leaves no residue behind and he thinks it looks cool, win/win.
0,Good product at a good price.
0,The cheapest way to magnetically hang a handgun. You get 4 - one will hang a sub-compact, two will hang a full-frame without trouble.
0,used to put a patch on the automatic pool cover and it has been very durable over the course of the summer. Use outdoors or in a VERY well ventilated area. I got lightheaded using it outside on a 2 inch square patch. Strong fumes.
0,excellent product.  and good buy good delivery. Just put a drop of oil on the tip before you cap. This helps keep it from drying in the tip.
0,MET EXPECTATIONS!
0,These beakers are great for my intended occasional use.  They arrived in perfect condition, well packaged, and surprisingly within a few days of placing my order. NOTE - The glass is fairly thin so I would assume them to be slightly fragile -  Now, if your intentions are for heavy daily usage or to use them for heating things either for yourself, in a lab, classroom, business, etc. I suggest you pay a little more and get something of higher quality.  FOR MY INTENDED OCCASIONAL USE THEY'RE PERFECT.
0,Works perfectly. I use it to control a 1100watt heater element I have mounted in a 5 gallon kettle for a sous vide setup.
0,I like the packaging and how they are labeled with color dots so you remember what the colors are. Nothing else.
0,Excellent
0,Not the finest construction but not  far from it!
0,Works as well as the little ceramic stones I have used in the past, and I don't have the fear it will shatter, and send pieces flying.  It is made by bonding diamond dust to a solid steel 'drum'.  Even if the diamonds do fly off for some reason, they aren't going to come off in shattered chunks, like the stones sometimes do.	As an added bonus, they seem to be lasting longer than even the best stones I have used, and don't cost all that much.  They come in a little bag, with each one in an individual plastic tube, to protect not only the burrs, but they will keep the burrs from scratching anything they might come in contact with while in storage.

0,Got these because I wanted to be able to measure gaps and openings as I built a digital scoreboard for my shuffleboard table. I needed to know how much space some of the LED matrix chips and buttons would take up for cutting and drilling. For this use, these calipers will be perfect!		What is a real bonus for me is that these also take inside gap measurements AND depth measurements. So, for a very competitive price, I have added a very versatile tool to my collection.		The Neiko 01407A comes in a handy hard plastic case to keep the caliper safe. The caliper itself is pre-installed with a battery, and comes with an extra battery, that is a great bonus in a time when so many items come batteries not included.		The caliper feels solid in the hands. A good weight, not cheap or flimsy, and the thumb-adjustment, while preferential to right-handed people, is very easy to use. I found in general use that there was little to no play in the slide between the time I took the measurement to the time I locked down the top pin.		Thinking of a digital caliper for use around the house - go for this one, I doubt you will be disappointed.
0,Good light.
0,Love this little gagdet. Pefect for spot checking temps in my  reptiles cage. Love the on and off for the laser. Came ready to toy around with...battery was included.  Nice leather pouch. Ive been eyeing these for months and so happy i found the Etekcity 8550 and for a fraction  of what others charge.
0,Excellent for soldering / de-soldering support !!  I love how I can clamp onto a 2 pin / 3 pin component and just let the weight of the tweezers pull the component out as I de-solder the leads !!!  High quality and reasonable price !!
0,looks good
0,Purchased to replace a Shurflo 120v AC pump I was using to pump water from our stream. The AC pump wore the (non-serviceable) brushes out fairly quickly. The DC 12v versions last much longer and pump about the same amount of water. Powering with 2- 6v golf cart batteries this thing pumps water 30 feet high for hours and hours. Flow is as expected- somewhere between 1-2 gallons per minute at 30ft high.
0,good product
0,I wish I had time to share more information about the quality and positive results from this product. You won't go wrong by purchasing this and other products from this company. Stan - West Columbia, Texas
0,easy to install, looks great & works great.
0,Worked well
0,This is one of my favorite purchases. It is a great value and has already been more useful than I thought it would be. The case is nice and the extra battery is a plus. It is very versatile for measuring sizes of inside or outside diameters, lengths, etc.
0,Excellent bang for the buck. No way to justify what AutoZone wants for these. I bought extras just to have on hand.
0,good quality hose a lot less expensive than my local NAPA
0,Hatchbox is the only manufacturer with consistently high quality filament that works right consistantly. Is significantly cheaper than other brands. I will only buy Hatchbox unless they don't have the color I need.
0,Not much to say about these bags. They do what they were purchased for, which was to merge a few multi vitamins into one to hold in my wallet.
0,Like others the one that came with my unit cracked and was draining.  I bought this as a replacement on January 4, 2012 and it's now January 16, 2013.  It's still working perfectly.  Highly recommended, great replacement product - it's just too bad that they didn't get it right the first time.		-D
0,Great addition to my modelers\hobbyist Tool box ( I scratch build model railroads )  For the money is a Steal.  Well made and nice array of tips
0,Does everything I was hoping.  Good durability, can reuse indefinitely.  The zip-lock opens and closes easily w/o tearing (what I needed).  Haven't found any defective bags yet.  Only downside is I don't need 1K of these, but that's how they come.
0,I LOVE  PC  PRODUCTS!! always my first choice!!
0,I've been using several different colors of HATCHBOX ABS filament with my XYZprinting Da Vinci 1.0 and this blue filament works quite well. The default heat settings of the Da Vinci (90'C bed, 210'C extruder) have no problems with it. I've noticed occasionally there's black spots on the print using this but haven't quite figured out why.
0,These are very strong, which is important to me. The mediums fit as they should. Other than that, they're good vinyl gloves.
0,Good product.  We're too cheap for the 2-3-4 blocks
0,- I saw this recommended on a couple of websites for Luthiers ((people who hand-craft guitars and other stringed instruments)).  I'm working on making some kalimbas, which are not stringed, but are wooden, and are musical instruments, so there ya go ;)	 - The *quality* of this product is high, which is why I gave five stars.  It's exactly as described, and seems to be to hold like, er, dare I say "crazy"? LOL!  -  For better or worse, I also do like that it's a US product and that the company helps our Veterans.	 - Interestingly, this does not seem to me to have much of a "smell", which I consider to be a good thing, since it indicates that the glue contains fewer volatile chemicals.	 - I do keep it in a tightly-closed jar with 2 dessicant packs ((10 grams total of silicon granules)), but not in the fridge, because I use it too often.  It seems to still flow as it ought to, although the tip does clog a bit, probably because I only snipped off a tiny part of the tip so that the opening is *just barely* large enough for me to insert a slender pin.  But that's the trade-off when one works on a small scale.	 - On the Plus side, all I have to do is give the pin a very slight twist and pull it out, and Presto!, there is glue flow  ;)	 - I like that this sets rather slowly - it gives me time to make adjustments and be sure things are fitting together as I want them to.  I'll eventually try mixing it with powdered substances ((I'll try wood bits first ;) )) for gap-filling and, with luck!, decoration, but I haven't yet gotten around to trying that.		 - I *personally* haven't adapted to using this glue, though, so I make sure I have my work surface covered, and sometimes I wear lightweight nitrile gloves.  But all in all, this medium-thick consistency is MUCH preferable to me than the super-thin CA glues I've previously bought locally.
0,I am happy that a high quality product
0,Works very well fro what I needed, very corrisive resistant.
0,I use this for sealing my Tent Seams it works better than anything REI sells at half the cost and more than doubled the amount, it dries within 15 Minutes and usable within one day because of this I Cary a small tube for EMG sealing on the trail.	It's strong sealing is clear and completely flexible!		I will use nothing other than this product for tent seam sealing.		It's Amazing (<:}!!
0,Very accurate"handy tool
0,We need caution tape for fund raising events to keep visitors from areas in the park where we hold our events. This was an inexpensive tape and i was surprised at the good quality. It looks like this tape would hold up in all types of weather for months, though we only need it for a day. Alos, this is inexpensive insurance to prevent an accident.
0,good stuff
0,Yellow Jacket products are usually a top quality product and these ball valves were no exception.  They looked and performed perfect so far.
0,Excellent little unit for making milliohm measurements.  Four probe system works and the clips are pretty reasonable.
0,This stainless steel pipe is lighter and stronger than normal DOM tubing, and it doesn't rust.
0,I bought this because I wanted to have a sturdy, easy to clean table to place some messy appliance on.  I have a shave ice machine with syrup bottles on one side.  You know how messy that gets.  Just a wipe of a towel cleans everything up.  The other side I have food a 14 tray food dehydrator.  That's a mess as well.  The table has no problems with the weight.  Overall, love it.  Only one wish, at this price, another bottom tray would seem fair.
0,good item try them,
0,The company says its namesake product, WD-40, can be found in 4 out of 5 American households. I believe it  and mine has been one of those households since early in the products life. Technically, WD-40 started as a rust penetrator and, in my opinion, remains unexcelled in that task.		 For many years, cans of WD-40 came with a little red plastic tube aped to the side which was to be inserted in the nozzle to get some directionality to the spray. If you didn't lose the tube, it some valuable functionality.		 Now here we are, about 60 years after the products launch and we have an act of complete and utter brilliance: a very flexible metal tube of about 8 inches long that can be twisted into virtually any shape to get at that pesky nut or whatever at the back of the furnace or engine hood or wherever.		 You can use the can in its normal position for spraying a wider close up area, if you like. And I suspect one of those little red plastic tubes will fit into the nozzle. (Personally, I think they should still tape one to the side. They may be a bit of a pain to keep track of, but they do come in handy.)		 When you want to use the flexible metal tube, just lift it up to a horizontal position.		 The tube is long enough, when used with your outstretched arm, to get your WD-40 just about anywhere you want it, including places  youll never be able to get as wrench to, but thats a different story.		 As a less than typical home handyman these days, my need for this brilliant innovation is less than what it once was. But undoubtedly a lot of knuckles and hangs are going to be save from scratched and bruises by this little piece of brilliance, the flexible stem on a WD-40 can. Very col stuff!		Jerry
0,Works great
0,i go to several gaming conventions, when you get to the hotel the luggage racks are few and far between.  having this makes the whole process much faster. holds alot and sturdy!
0,I've been using Oral-B (Braun) electric toothbrushes for years.  They've done an excellent job preventing plaque build-up and keeping my gums healthy.  I like this model better than the version that's smaller, lighter and simply vibrates...that version is easier to use on back molars, but doesn't seem to clean as well overall.  Looking specifically at this model...		Pros:	Excellent cleaning action	Small charging stand	Comparable with different styles of brush heads		Cons:	No place to put another person's brush head	Only single speed	Included head will flick toothpaste absolutely everywhere if you take it out of your mouth while operating (trust me on this...)	The base is slightly dished, which holds water after rinsing the brush.  After a week, there's a buildup of crud that needs to be wiped off.		All in all, I like this toothbrush.  The cons aren't deal killers.  It's not perfect, but it does it's job.
0,I breed snakes and cant have enough of these. I have one every three feet in height of my breeding room to keep track of temperature gradiants, one on every shelf of my incubator, one in each incubation tub with the eggs and maybe onoe or two scattered elsewhere in the house. I love that they tell you the change in humidity and temp throughout the day too.
0,Good stickiness and coverage. Included brush is very large though.
0,Standard black filament, prints well. Will buy again
0,Nice epoxy.
0,PETG is the new plastic to print with.  Prints at higher temps like ABS without the sticking/warping problems, it has been a real pain to print something larger and have the corners bending up even with a heated bed and hairspray or glue sticks.  With PETG I can print large flat bases with no problem of lifting corners, the print stays down until the plate cools then it pops right off.  The translucent colors are very cool too		cons:	It seems the tradeoff has been more spider webs in the print and trying to find the sweet spot for a truly clean print.
0,as advertised
0,I was very happy with this item. It meet my expectations and work as described.
0,Just what I wanted! Great price.
0,Awesome filament. I noticed the difference from regular PLA
0,Doesn't everyone like Tap Magic? Just don't use it on aluminum.
0,WORKED AS DESCRIBED!
0,Peace of mind for years to come!!! !
0,What can you say its a Gorilla Glue product.  I use it on the cover over the pick up bed of my 2003 Subaru Baja.  The original cover had been in all the elements for over 10 years and needs some help in keeping together. I have used this tape in the past it holds up for about a year. I could not find my roll when I was going to use it so I reordered it on Amazon. Great price came in 2 days using Amazon Prime.
0,Great
0,Does what it is designed to do.
0,These work well with the standard blocks and a bowden E3D V6 Bowden head!
0,Exactly as advertised.
0,Great!!
0,It looks a little rough built but its very sturdy. No leaks. Flow rate is decent. Wish the size of the nipples was larger.
0,These pins are great. I Use them on a boat in a very saltwater environment and after a year they have not shown the slightest bit of rust.
0,This works really well.  Use it liberally on rubber like surfaces.
0,So, this is the one brand I have tried other than Hatchbox that has worked.  I have taken chances with other brands, and regretted it.  This time, I had no choice as I couldn't find the color I wanted through Hatchbox.  This stuff looks great, and prints great.  I have no complaints.  The colors are just right, and I have had no major printing problems.
0,Great product.  Works as advertised.
0,Thay aire good
0,We aren't surgeons around here so we don't know how these would preform in their natural habitat .For us this group is cost effective and has proven their durability along with convenience of having some of these everywhere we have some tools grouped together. We also keep a pair any place we have small parts. Carburetor parts,small hardware of any kind .Now we have some age  and are taking a variety of medications so now theirs even a pair with our meds. This set is is great for anyone that from time to time needs to get little things from places their fingers just don't seam to fit or find it necessary to hold small things together keeping their hands free. This set is for you if being frugal ain't a bad thing otherwise theirs lots of places on line you can pay for one pair what this whole set cost. If this helps you at all let me know cause we don;t want to waste your time or ours . THANK YOU
0,Perfect for many things. I make different kinds of packaging and this is great.
0,Item arrived on time.  Appears to be in working order.  No bent pins, cracks, etc.
0,good enough for home hardness testing.  i install my own water softeners.
0,I used this to check the engine temps in my 51 Ford. The temp gauge only has slash marks,not numbers,and since it is 65 years old I had no way of knowing if it was accurate or not.		This is accurate enough to tell the different temps in each cylinder,and to note the radiator is cooler at the bottom than at the top in a running engine after a 15 mile drive in the summer.		The peace of mind it gave me knowing my obsolete,rate,and expensive engine block was in no danger of cracking from heat is well worth the price paid,plus it saved me from having to pay 600 bucks for a new radiator to be sure everything was ok.		And I can still use it to check wheelbearing and other bearing temps,brake drum temps,rear end and trans temps,etc,etc,etc
0,This stuff prints well if you get it dialed in right. I prefer to print thicker layers (.5 nozzle and .35 layers) and after I calibrate my extruder I print at 95% flow rate. If you print at the normal 100% as you would for PLA, you will get stringy blobs with PETg. I deduct 1 star because this stuff has a strong chemical smell. It might just be the nature of PETg
0,awsome
0,This is a very well-made part, nice finish and heavy duty. i used this to modify the grease trap on my Blackstone griddle.
0,Product is not too cheaply made. It does tone well. Worked with it several times to sort out the nightmare wiring issue in the house. (Thank you previous home owner)
0,looks good and u can see the lines
0,Great protection for my Accugage tire pressure gauge. A good tire pressure gauge deserves protection, this is it for my Accugage..
0,I bought the handtruck at HD for $60. Tires deflated and I was unable to pump them up again. Buy a new handtruck and have the same problem? No thanks... I purchased these flat free wheels and they work great! No longer will I need to worry about having a handtruck with flat tires when I need it! This handtruck will last me a long time! I'm extremely happy with these wheels. The kit came with differing sizes of bushings for literally all lengths of axles and will work with all handtrucks with 5/8" axles if you are handle enough.
0,Purchased for school district.  Since I didn't hear any complaints (which I would), I can only assume that teacher was happy with the item.
0,love it!!
0,Needed a food save lubricant for the pressing screw on my cider press. Straight mineral oil was too viscous, but this fit the bill perfectly, keeping to the shaft and not into the mash.
0,well designed for a peg board
0,I liked it enough to buy it again.. prints a little weird but when you get the hang of it prints very nice.
0,it looses wire the whole time its spinning but works well make sure you have eye protection and long sleeves loose wire was hitting my face and a piece of wire stuck in my arm

0,This is a must have tool if you are a serious griller.  You want a surface area of 500 to 600 degrees for good burger steak searing and this device will let you know if you need more coals or wood.
0,I like the 3D Solutech PLA, I have several rolls in various colors no issues with any of them. 200C on glass

0,I like JB Weld products. I saw this as an add-on and the price is cheaper than on my local store. I actually have half a tube left on my old one so I just bought this as reserve. You can never run out of this stuff.
0,work great with no problems
0,Works fine.
0,great
0,awesome thank you so much
0,exactly as described
0,The Glue works great.
0,Prints reliably in my machine and gives great results.  I plan on buying many more of this one.
0,Very good product!
0,Worked as intended. No issues.
0,This stuff is awesome. I covered the handles of a stock pot with the tape and I can pick up the pot even when the water is boiling.
0,All 100 came. I wiped them off to play it safe. So far no residue. One alone can lift almost 7 ounces and 3 together can lift 19 ounces. I'd say that's pretty good for their size.  Will be using for custom fridge magnets.		One magnet will hold 8 pages up on a fridge.  Also don't waste your money on Y35 magnets.  There is no difference when sticking to a refrigerator door.  So save your money and get these instead.		Update:9/17/2017  Tested on my whiteboard at work. One will hold 13 pages up so the more iron in the surface the stronger the magnet.	Update 10/11/2017  Still doing well. After getting the Y35 magnets I can appreciate the quality of these C5 magnets. On my white board I can tell the 2 apart.  The C5's are smooth on the edges where as the Y35's are rough and jagged.
0,I wanted to make flush mount catches for 12 slide bolt latches. This tubing was close to the perfect ID for the slide bolts. I needed to cut 12 3/4" segments. At first, I tried a jig saw with a stainless steel blade. It worked but got hot and made a rough cut that wasn't easy to file. I had better success with the Ridgid stainless steel tube cutter. If you need to cut this, you'll want the right tool.
0,This thing is awesome!
0,Aluminum - just like you would expect. It's silvery colored and machines pretty well. Alloy 6061 is harder than pure aluminum but still machines fairly well. The surface is smooth but not polished. It can take a good finish.
0,The absolute BEST electrical tape in existence! I've tried others over the years, but 33+ has been my go-to for 20+ years. Nothing else compares to it's strength, flexibility, water/heat/UV resistance, longevity, etc.		Can't say enough about this tape. I'd gladly pay 2x as much (but I'm glad I don't have to).
0,Great item
0,Works fine for propane line in my RV.  Pleased with purchase.
0,they are what they are
0,So far so good. It comes with its own reference Solutions which is nice, though I already have bass reference solution of my own. Being yours with different contaminants and so forth causes the element to become dingy then calibration is necessary weekly with regular use. Calibration is very easy and convenient.
0,Great product!
0,I am finding more uses for this thing... Find cold spots in my house.  Checking outlets.  And to find out the temp. of my must while brewing my wine.
0,Christmas gift.
0,These are exactly what you think they are. Great Safety Traffic Cones. They are sufficiently weighted so that they are not blown over by passing traffic. I use them when I park my 5th wheel on the street (well actually on the side of the street) when we are loading it up for a trip.
0,should have bought  longer
0,Good assortment of 5mm LEDs.  LEDs arrived sorted into packages of 10 and each plastic bag has a colored label to indicate the color of the LED.  A full bundle of resistors (200 ohm tape strip) is included.  LEDs are bright and work fine.
0,Arrived on time.  Appears well made.  My only complaint is that I cannot find a way to use the horizontal and vertical cursors at the same time.
0,They work great on a diy tablet holder for a wheelchair to roll under.  Locks keep it in place.
0,Using this in a Dremel Idea Builder 3D45 and the results were great!  The standard 3D45 spools come with RFID so once placed into the printer, the settings are automatically set.  Because these do not have said RFID tag included, the printer prompted me to choose the material type and then the various other settings for the material such as extruder temp, heated bed temp, etc.  This was no issue and I had control over each either at the printer itself or within the Dremel slicing software as well the online printer interface.		The product came properly vacuum sealed and with desiccant pack included.  Because of habit; once opened I placed the'filament in my DIY dry box' (semi-airtight box with loose descant) for them to properly cure and remove any moisture, however, this likely may not be needed right out of the seal.  The material a day or two later was placed in the printer and not a single issue.		Being hard pressed to find 'something' wrong; the only thing I could come up with is that the actual spool the filament is on, unlike the 3D45 counterparts, does not have 'holes' or spacing in the spoked areas.  This makes it a bit tricky to get the spool back out of the spool holder built into the printer.  I have large hands and as such could not get a grip on the edge to remove so I simply had to place a wooden stick and slide/pry out the spool some to get a grip.  Overall nothing to be concerned with but something that caught me in one of those 'Ah Ha!' moments.		Overall a great product and price and I will continue to purchase these spools of filament.  They work great and cannot recommend enough!
0,Easy to use.  Clear to read.
0,Thank You .
0,Cutting fluid is essential to everyone who does not want to keep having to sharpen their cutting tools or replacing them because they get dull. This fluid makes it easier to cut through any metal or plastic with out galling and without damaging your cutting tools.
0,I bought these so that I could mix oil paints with a repeatable method. I paint waterfowl and getting the colors right is always a trick. Using these pipettes, I can measure each color and mix the same color every time. Also perfect for adding turpentine and Japan drier to the mixed colors. When you are done, throw them away. Bought the package  of 500 so I think that will last me a few years.
0,love this thing make making antennas much easier since they are mostly mm

0,3D solutech real white prints very nicely in my Makergear m2 BUT it does not offer the true "white" color of many of its competitors. It also is more difficult to get a nice gloss.	I can't fault this material for general prints, but if you want the best looking prints, I'd pick another white (unless you are after a creamy-white).
0,Very happy with this product.  Nice and sturdy, and I've had no problems with tearing, leaking.  Material is strong.  Just what I was looking for.  Highly recommended.
0,Good stuff, but like any other glue, you can stick things together that you don't intend to, like fingers, clothes, whatever is near the glue. It does take longer to set than the super glue type products though.  I needed to glue a kitchen cabinet knob back on and after getting smart and gluing then taping it to the cabinet door with duct tape overnight, it worked great.
0,exactly what I ordered!  exactly the length I bought!  great quality!
0,Much better than the cheaper ones!	I will be buying these from now on.	Cheaper ones work great. Just these donkast longer and worth the couple more dollars!!
0,I've owned a home made 3D printer for a couple of years and finally broke down and purchased a MakerBot Replicator 5th Generation.  The original extruders did have some issues (what new, featured-packed technology doesn't?), but with the latest Smart Extruder+ the issues appear to have been resolved.		The new extruder is redesigned and I have printed hundreds of hours with no issues. For all of the folks that have had extruder issues, give support a call and get yours changed out to the new version.		This is as close as anyone has gotten to a simple plug and play 3D printer. Sure there are many cheaper competitors, but how many other 3D printers have filament jam detection and pauses the print when it runs out of filament? And the rare time the new extruder jams, just swap in a new one and unjam the jammed the extruder later. (no other printer lets you do that).		Unlike other 3D printers I've owned, I have no worries leaving the house while it prints a 70+ hour print job. I can even check on the print at anytime with the mobile app.		The super fine print (0.1 mm layers) items look amazing. It makes it difficult to look at prints at .3mm or larger.
0,Great item. Just as described.
0,Quality tape
0,Excellent
0,I used this mat under a chair thas a wooden base and sits inside on tile floor.  Keeps it from slipping.  Great and looks good.
0,A++++
0,great for us metal workers
0,as usual, the Hatchbox Wood filament I have received have all arrived on-time, well-packaged and have printed very, very well.  No complaints - very satisfied.	Printer: Robo 3D R1+
0,This makes an enormous difference in the adhesion of 3M VHB glues. Very expensive, but when you need it, you just have to get it.
0,Have used but only one of these products, the Gray one. I will let you know a few months from now f it works good or not.
0,HEAVY DUTY FOR KEYS AND SMALLER ITEMS. THESE WERE USED TO REPLACE DIFFERENT MAGNETS THAT WOULD SLIDE DOWN THE SIDES OF THE FRIDGE OR TOOL BOX. THESE STAY IN PLACE AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THEM FOR MEDIUM  DUTY USE FOR VERTICAL USE. HAVE NOT USED THEM IN A HORIZONTAL POSISTION WERE THEY SHOULD HOLD BETTER.
0,This material has good machining characteristics.  Easily drilled, cut, milled or turned in a lathe.  6061 aluminum can be welded as well.
0,I ordered pads with the wrong connectors so I can't use them, but that isn't the fault of the pads, which are very well made.  So well made that I'm going to modify a couple sets of leads to use them.
0,will reorder thanks!
0,Great buy and easier to use than other over priced cool mist brands.
0,Haqve been using this for decades - only way to do a protected splice that will actually survive water - especially if encased in heat shrink afterwards.
0,k
0,Surprisingly satisfied with this filament. I was a bit worried buying a filament that is stocked on Amazon Prime but it has been a breeze to use. Finish is a bit shiny and nothing special.		I am running a Prusa i3 MK2.
0,Great gloves for the price point!  I use these on our cars, painting, working in the backyard, just about everything!		On car days, even the guys use them now when wrenching on our rides.  The only downside to this is that they use up all of my gloves. hehe  When painting, these are great because you can change out gloves when paint gets everywhere.  Beats having to run to a sink just to clean your hands for the next round or color of paint.  Working in the backyard is great when installing, repairing the sprinkler system.  Keeps your hands from getting muddy.
0,works great!
0,Very interesting concept, but usually use other things. Still and all, I will try to use these more often.
0,Strechy, holds paint well, but dries too fast for some fine finish work. It is difficult to clean up excess. If one goes slow and very carefully in application for finish / trim caulking, results can be good. So far, no shrinkage used on bare pine and hemfir trim prior to primer and paint. So far, no issues holding Sherwin Williams premium wall and window primer paint with Pro Classic on top of that. Problems cleaning up stray excess or caulk that dried too fast were the worst in very warm and dry temperatures.		If there is no shrinkage or other issue in a year or so, I'll add a star!		Update, one year later:	As promised, one star added from the initial four stars a year ago. Everything I painted inside, every place that I used this caulk is still holding up fine. This is a very good caulk. Making the smallest possible opening, combined with a good caulking gun that stops when released, makes the job go well.		No shriking or similar issues so far. If things are not good in another year, I'll knock it back to four stars.
0,We just bought the Shark HV302 vacuum with detail kit. It is light but made with sturdy parts, and is a great size for our small house. The rotating power head makes it easy to get into corners and under couches and beds. The power head rattles dirt so it can be sucked up into the vacuum, and the smaller head size means it can get into tight places.		Pros:		- Small, light weight but made with sturdy plastic.	- Balanced in the hands.	- Floor duster helps clean wood or non-carpeted floors. Rag that goes over duster is washable.	- Multiple filters to keep the motor running smoothly. Simply wash the filters once a month.	- Wall hanging mount.	- Ability to take off power head and put on other attachments. Long extension tube can also be taken off to use this on stars.	- Smaller upholstery tool and crevice tool.	- Easy to open and dump collection cup. Love it.	- Each part is easy to open, like for the collection cup, filters, etc. but has a positive latching mechanism.	- Noise level is less than my Kenmore canister vac from 1993.	- Long cord with cord wrap.		Cons:		- No light on power head. But then I've never had a vacuum where the light helps much anyway so this is not much of a con.		Note:		- 2 speeds is for rotating brush on the power head, NOT for the suction amount. Suction is always the same.	- I vacuumed my living room (carpeted) and kitchen (linoleum) and the dust cup came back with tons of hair! I had no idea it was there, but when you concentrate it in the cup you can see it. We occasionally baby sit a dog so some of it is dog hair.		Honestly, I'm a tough person to please because I'm always about quality and value. I'm always suspicious of a product sold on TV because I've had mostly bad experiences, but I think they did good here! I'll report back in a year to see how it holds up.		Apr 15, 2016. Vacuum is still doing very well. We found it picks up dog hair really well without clogging the rollers or the filter.
0,GREAT ITEM
0,These are so handy for many uses, hamburger patties of course, but also for individual homemade garlic bread to freeze for later!
0,Excellent product.  Much better than expected.  Thanks
0,I bought this to put under my swamp cooler just in case it leaks. Perfect!
0,Great product and price
0,Nice looking table.  Did have a ding or two on top where it was spot welded, but doesn't effect anything.
1,The sticker on the top that says "peel here" doesn't come off.  When peeling I had to scratch it off and now the lid looks like hell.  Thanks a lot!
1,Toy like not for a pro
1,Not copper. Aluminum is, what's inside...	It has a good qtty of aluminum too, but it specifically said copper on the description. For that reason only I'm giving it such poor ratings.
1,These meters are trash. Amazon has been great in sending me 2 replacements but the first 2 arrived damaged, the 3rd one worked for about a week or so but now it won't calibrate to the 4.0 solution. It just says er1. Very disappointing being that i thought i was stepping up in quality and price, turns out it was just a step up in price.
1,Horrible  PTFE tubing.  You can't use this tube for two reasons.  either it's smaller than 1.5mm ID  in spots or it's so large the filament springs inside it!  Stay away from this one!  I have bought this sellers products befoe*  Same item and it was not garbage like the one he sent!  Verry disappointing!
1,The batch I got was runny despite my "kneading" the tube before applying.  It dripped and dropped and generally made a mess when I tried to apply it.  Don't recommend.
1,Good quality filament for a great price.  Using this on my Proforge with a 0.4mm nozzle printing in 0.2mm layers and the results are really quite good.		UPDATE:  So, the quality of prints with this filament are very good.  However, I had TONS of problems with the spool.  Catches were a regular occurrence, and with a Bowden feed, this can be a problem.  They self-corrected a few times, but I also had to run over to the printer and fix the catch many, many times.  A couple of times small prints failed because of this (led to "air printing" where nothing was being fed).		The worst was about 80% through the roll, the filament was completely tangled; not caught, but looped around itself.  It failed 20 hours into a 28 hour print.  So, I probably lost a decent amount of the roll and a whole lot of time.  So far I like the quality of the actual filament from Hatchbox (this wasn't my only roll), but the other roll has also had a lot of catches.  If I find that it is looped on itself somewhere, both items will probably end up with a 1-star rating.  Doesn't matter how nice a good print feels when you have failed prints due to poor QA/QC.
1,Says that it is 12x12 inch but actually came 11.75x11.75 inch.  Unfortunately this is too small for what I needed and took 2 months for it to arrive.
1,do not buy this color unless you are ready for headaches. Hatchbox usually makes great filament and "fire sale merchant" was very helpful (I only recently tried using it, a few days after the return window and when I let them know it was bad they sent a new roll). The new roll is has better adhesion and less warping, but is simply unusable. the difference between two rolls says that there is some variability, so maybe some people get lucky, but even under the best conditions (filament stored in a dessicant box, well-tuned printer in an enclosure) you'll have issues.
1,not sticky at all
1,There was air in the filament.  I was having issues, so I decided to check for the quality of the filament and found air gaps in it! Thats why I gave it one star. I used to buy all my filament from gizmo dorks. but I have had issues with every roll. Maybe you'll have better luck.
1,Washers like washers... the box is useless as a storage. The plastic locking snap on broke like a twig. Cannot close it; only tape it. Where is the saving if the sorting storage is disposable? What's the point of "saving"? Toss it all to a brown bag and you will save one cent more.
1,Exactly as described. Fast shipping!
1,They are well priced, not bright or focused very well. Good for tinkering, not so good if you have a specific goal in mind
1,Very Disappointed. Don't have a clear view.  Sent it back.
1,PRO:		1.  Arrived on time.	2.  Works as advertised.	3.  Has dual language stickers.	4.  Bright red and two lock holes in case two people want to lock out at the same / different times.		CON:	1.  Plastic, let me say that again, it's PLASTIC!	2.  If using for SECURITY reasons, this can be broken off easy.	3.  Any padlock can be twisted and break this PLASTIC device off easy.	4.  It "binds" on itself when you try to use it.		OTHER:	1.  It's plastic.  So once this breaks by someone trying to steal water from me, I'll have to buy something better / stronger.	2.  Read reviews, this one got me, lesson learned.	3.  I would have paid more for a metal one.
1,Well, in some respects this is a terrific vacuum.  It's powerful, it does the job, it's easy to maneuver.  Unfortunately, however, it is plagued with problems related to the lack of strength of some of its plastic parts.  First, the cord holder clip broke, so we have to hold the cord in one hand while pushing the machine around.  Then the clip that holds the front-mounted HEPA filter door closed broke, so the door flops open frequently, which results in dust (and cat hair) being blown away from you as you try to vacuum it up.  Then the clip that holds the dust canister to the body of the vacuum broke, so it doesn't stay in place, nor can you pick up the vacuum by its handle to move it.		To Shark's credit, when I contacted them about replacement parts, they asked how long we'd had it.  Two years.  Well, they said, it has a five-year warranty, so they're sending us replacement parts free.  That's good.  But why the cheap Chinese plastic fittings to begin with???  Sorry, but I just have no patience for this stuff, especially when the product is well designed--just not well built.
1,I tried two of these and they both lagged behind the picture.
1,Amazon keeps removing my bad review of this product. Not sure why, but trust me this stuff is total junk. Got three rolls and two of the three had major issues, If you look at the uploaded photos you will see major issues with blobs every few feet. I just tossed it all in the trash. I would never buy this cheap junk again regardless what the last user says. I buy PLA all the time. I have purchase over 50 rolls from various companies and this stuff was by far the worst I have seen. I guess the truth hurts which is why Amazon keeps removing my review. This stuff clogged my extruder so bad I needed to replace it.
1,The posts themselves are good quality but the carbide inserts are not. The tip chips off almost immediately no matter the cut.	Would not buy again
1,I bought this to fix some small holes in my car seat. This tape is so incredibly reflective that your repair sticks out like a sore thumb. I am going to remove it, try to find something that will improve the look, not make it look worse.
1,I've gotten more stickiness from a clamy handshake.  It's not tape, it's vinyl with hot breath on it.	No stick
1,I have been using four of these units in my basement for the past three months.  Last night I decided to check them for consistency.  I place all four next to each other.  After 15 minutes, all four units had different humidity readings.  I left them together over night; this morning, they are all different again.  CRAZY different, ranging from 63% to 72%.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!!
1,Just arrived today. Put 2 different batteries in it and didn't work. Great that Amazon was able to refund me but I wanted a working item. Poor quality control on manufacturer.
1,These two 5" rolls of stretch wrap DO NOT come with a dispenser, as advertised in the description.  They have 1.25" O.D. cardboard tubes sticking out of them which make it impossible to apply the wrap one handed.  The old Bankers Box rolls came with a dispenser that allowed the rolls to rotate, so the wrap could be dispensed one-handed.
1,Did not stay flat when heated. Cannot recommend.
1,Amazon deletes what matters anyway!
1,Problematic prints with this material.  Typically Hatchbox works really well.  This batch has constantly broken off at the extruder, it's very brittle.		Color is really nice, but print quality suffers.  Tolerance is advertised at +/- 0.03,  the spool says +/- 0.05,  actual seemed to range from 1.65 to 1.78
1,I am extremely disappointed. According to product information this should have been no greater than 8.0005mm. Mine came in with spots that measured as much as 8.1mm. Totally worthless as a shaft for a  LM8UU linear bearing. In fact trying to get it in was a little stiff. I thought that i just needs a little oil. Nope it actually damaged my bearings. I was going to use these as a temporary shaft since they are 5x cheaper than a linear motion shaft but now not only can't i use them for that but i have to buy new bearings too.		As a final note i found a nick in one of the three rods i ordered. Needless to say i won't be buying these again in the perceivable fututre.
1,$120 cheaper at  www <dot> gearbest <dot> com/3d-printers/pp_128938.html and the one at gearbest states it'll print ABS in addition to PLA.		Lots of physical collision points.  Be ready with an angle grinder or small hacksaw.  Frame is square (good).  Electronics failed, vendor said it worked when they shipped it so I was out of luck.  I replaced the electronics with a RAMPS1.4 card I had and it now works fine.  Bearings needed lubrication.  Ok price for a kit except for the electronics failure.
1,I have had this now for a year and it is inaccurate by 5 degrees Fahrenheit.  I have set the a/c in the house to 78 and it shows 73.  I have also tested the area this sits with an infrared thermometer and that shows the temperature to be 77.8.  I even changed the battery.  Who knows how accurate the humidity sensor is.  Not sure how this has so many good reviews.
1,Good tool
1,The hardware seemed OK, but the software was garbage.  Wouldn't work in 3 different Android devices (Samsung S7 Edge, Nexus 9, Nexus 6P with proper USB-C adapter).  The one nice thing about this unit is that it came with Micro USB adapters so you can flip the camera 180 to face a different direction since Micro USB isn't reversible.		I ended up returning this unit and getting the Seek competitor.  So far, so good.		A note to FLIR.  Don't say that the Nexus 6P/5X are not supported.  Link to a proven adapter like Seek did; or even better, offer that adapter either in the box or as an additional accessory!  I really wanted to love this product, sadly disappointed.
1,Save your money for something more high end. I constantly have to recalibrate my bed, and even if I make no changes, they calibration will show a different number EVERY SINGLE TIME.		Also, even if the calibration is a "success" the extrude will hit the bed when it is cleaning, or sometimes make a grinding sound across the bed as it is printing, and I will have to start over.		The prints come out pretty sloppy as well. Could it be that I got a bad unit?		I regret not saving my money for a Makerbot.		My only hope that the future firmware and software updates will make my prints come out better... And I also hope that it is something as simple as a bad sensor making my calibration so difficult.
1,did not do my job
1,The diameter of the pipe is not the same as good blowers.
1,do not buy. waste of money. you get a tiny amount, and i wrapped the hell out of a garden hose coupling, even tried it twice, with no success.  still leaks.  so, don't expect a miracle.
1,these terminals are not as heavy duty as those purchase from HomeDepot, although they are rated the same. Really worried about if these can hold up the same amount of electric current. Easily deformed when crimping to wires, easily loosen up after crimping. The metal material is too thin to hold the shape.
1,The unit I received was not accurate. I tested it and compared it to my thermostat in my house  along with other thermostats I have. I also compared it to another unit I bought here that has a wireless receiver. And tested against my local weather station reports. This unit was 20% off on the humidity and 10-15 off on the temp.
1,not the gaffers tape im used to, plastic finish does not conform well and the adhesive is hardly up to snuff
1,Brooke in 2 months
1,Not like any gaffer's tape I've ever used. Very thin, does not tear cleanly or straight, leaves white exposed edge of adhesive along the tear. It has fibers in it, but they're very loose, almost like that fiber packing tape, only much thinner.
1,I think it's bad?
1,came off in a week  wast of my time and money
1,I bought this a few Saturdays ago when my Shark had to be sent back to the company for repairs and I needed to vacuum before company came over. I got it for $32 and some change at Target with store discounts, etc. I listened to the good reviews on here and bought it, knowing full-well that a vacuum for $32 wasn't going to be that great (but decided to take a chance). I have had several vacuums in my lifetime, including- Kirby, Riccar, Shark, Dyson, Hoover, Eureka, etc. Assembly was simple and it took my husband very little time to assemble it. We immediately got to using it and did not notice any problems. But, after a few uses we noticed that it constantly became clogged. The clogs were mostly in the hose (which is nearly impossible to remove in order to remove the obstruction) but also in the brush roll part. The vacuum also started taking chunks of my carpet (which is a good quality/thick carpet I might add) and spitting the chunks out. Sorry, but I do not like a vacuum spitting pieces of carpet (and dirt I might add) out at me. A week after buying it, the vacuum began smoking terribly. We realized that it was the belt. I contacted the company to tell them about it and they only gave me tips to remedy this, no offer to replace the vacuum or anything. Also, the gray hose attachment does not want to stay on and falls off while you are vacuuming. I will be glad when my other vacuum returns to my house because I do not have this issue with my Kirby (which has no hose and was my reason for buying this one) nor my Shark.
1,~7 hour print ruined by tangles and stuck to itself in the spool.	Tangle was so tight, my extruder pulled the spool & holder forward to fall over!	Feel lucky my printer was not damaged.	See attached photos.  Stay away from this stuff!!		Was going to return; but, have just missed the return date.	I will have to re-spool this roll to use it & baby sit it for every print.	I didn't have to do this with that "H" brand that is out there, get what you pay for.
1,This is my first electric toothbrush and I generally like it, however it's impossible to activate the whitening setting...so I feel like I paid extra for nothing. I was told Philips Sonicare was the best electric toothbrush brand, but I find that hard to believe...
1,I ordered the 2000ml erlenmeyer flask to use for a yeast starter. It arrived well-packed and unbroken (which is good!), but on closer inspection it looked like it has been used.  There were numerous scratches in the glass and areas of some kind of stuck-on debris on the inside and outside.  I had to scrub it down with a bottle brush and warm OxiClean solution to get out the crud.  The bottom of the flask is not very flat and it wobbles when you set it on a flat surface.  Wish I had spent a bit more $$ for the Pyrex brand flask.
1,Cheap, not very reflective...
1,Im not an expert caulker and I like things perfect so when I was done I knew Id have a place or 2 to fix. It dries pretty quick.... I was caulking around the tub... I wasn't even going excessively slow, Im talking within the minute it was drying up. Normally that would be a good thing, not in this case. After applying and waiting a couple days one of the spots looked like it had a thin overlay on it. I rubbed on the flaky spot and it peeled off and just kept going and within less than a minute the whole thing and all my work was gone. Back to the regular silicone for me and is now perfect and sticking the first try.	The only thing I liked about this caulk was that it dried a bit harder than the silicone and wasn't as shiny. It kind of just blended right into the tub and tile.	This is the first Gorilla product out of many that I have been disappointed in.
1,Very weak bonding
1,worst experience ever!!!!!
1,These things really are tiny
1,Do not waste your money, this test regular water and alkaline water and there is no difference at all, anything that is wet there is no difference
1,Sorry, but wish I could share the same 5 star enthusiasm as others, but this filament has been nothing but a headache. It has blobs, it's stringy, and let's just call it cloudy translucent, not clear.  I recently purchased  5 rolls of Tianse and 2 rolls of AIO Robotics. Both brands worked first time right out of the box, and continue to perform flawlessly without spending my life trying to dial in workable settings.
1,Junky.
1,My spouse picked this up on his Amazon account. We put it back in the fridge after use, and the next time we went to use it, the pointed dunce cap is glued shot. Now your hand will slide to the top when trying to pull it off. We managed to get it off after 10 minutes.
1,I couldn't get the scale to calibrate correctly using exact water temperature measurements.  I measured this refractormeter against both my hydrometers and it was off by as much as .020. I had no issues returning the products and was quickly reimbursed.
1,I didn't bought this printer as I saw it at my friend, its horrible and expensive, I got flashforge creator pro instead and my friend is jealous and mine was only $1300 and I get better print quality than him.
1,Bought this as an open box item. Opened up the box and the vacuum cleaner with filthy on the outside there was dirt in the bottom of the box. Opened up the vacuum and it was filthy inside as well. It required quite an effort to wash my hands after just looking at the item. Not sure how well it works yet. Have to give it one star because 0 is not an option.
1,This is an absurd price. You can find generic pads elsewhere considering you are willing to hammer out the divet in the metal snap on the cable side. There are plenty of online guides showing how to get past compex's proprietary greed. You can get generic pads for 4-8 X less.
1,I guess you really do what get what you pay for sometimes.  This bundle sounded like exactly what I needed.  What I got was a lot of very small tubing and only a few larger ones and all of them are the absolutely cheapest quality heat shrink wrap that you can possibly find.  I used it once and then tossed the remainder because it is basically garbage.  I can shrink wrap cabling better using a plastic garbage bag.
1,I've had this unit less than a mount and it's dead. The screen has died and is so dim that it's unreadable and it's ineligible for a refund/return. Avoid this, spend a little more and get something quality.
1,I've had problems with this replica since I've started using it, filament getting clogged, leaking out of the heat break even when it was properly assembled with the nozzle tightened against it, and the PTFE hose all the way down to the heat break. My original jhead didn't had these issues.		UPDATE 2017/4/23:	I've still been using this hot end despite a few problems I've had. It's been almost 3 months using it, and as of this week the fan went out (made grinding noises, then stopped) so I had to replace the fan. Even before replacing the fan, to using the new fan, the fan is not cooling down the heatsink at all. Each part of the hot end is at their proper locations and tight. Because of this, there is now filament leaking out of the nozzle when its warming up.
1,The packaging was great.  The roll it's on is very nice.  The filament seems to be consistent.  It looks pretty nice when printed well. Good matte finish.		But the layer adhesion is horrible.		I was hoping that being a variant of ABS it would be usable for functional parts and not just to look pretty.  Unfortunately I had to throw away most of the parts I made for the intended project because they would break very easily.		I know layer adhesion can be a factor of temperature, cooling rate, and environment temp.  I have an enclosed print area.  I have a heated bed.  And I tried temps ranging from 10 degrees under the recommended spec to 10 degrees over.  It actually performed best on the low end, which was surprising. I used it right out of the vacuum sealed packaging that had a bunch of desiccant in it.		My theory is that whatever they blended the ABS with is decomposing in the melt process.  At the higher temps it just peels apart layer by layer.  At lower temps it's a little harder to get it to separate, but not hard enough.		All of the PLA I've ever used has been more functional than this.		Most of the ABS has also been better. (though I have tried some real junk that was not worth the incredible hassle it caused)		So far, the Hatchbox ABS and a local company called Coex have given me the best results with ABS.  The Coex natural ABS plus is incredibly strong.  But I don't know if the black is.		Often the Black has a lot of carbon or other additive to get the color.  That can degrade strength a lot.  Might be the case with this one too.		If you want something black that prints well for looks, this might do ok.  Just use lower temps like 220c.  If you want structural strength, look elsewhere.
1,Gave new life to my old Maglite.	Ordered this one and one from HQRP at the same time to see which was better. They both seem to be of equal quality and brightness. Big difference is shipping speed. The TerraLUX I had in 2 days and the HQRP took a week and HQRP is quite a few states closer. 5 stars because of the fast shipping. I will buy a few more for my other lights.		** Just got a chance to really compare the 2 brands. The HQRP is almost pure white where the TerraLUX has a bad yellowish tint. Not very desirable at all. I'm revising my rating to only 2 stars for the crappy yellowish light.
1,to fragile
1,The Geatex GXT60 Dual Laser thermometer gun is a nice looking thermometer. It has a nice weight to it and is a nice size. It did not feel like a toy. I read other reviews complaining about the battery compartment and screw. They must have redesigned it or they were referring to a different model. The GXT60 battery compartment just has the front of the handle that swing down and you snap on the included 9 volt battery after you remove the plastic wrap off the battery and swing it back up to close it.  It has all the features that I wanted, high alarm, low alarm, max temp, min temp, avg. temp, differential, adjustable EMS, data hold temp, laser on/off, backlight on/off, dual lasers and a pouch. But the main thing I wanted it didn't have and that was an accurate temperature readings. It was 5-10 degrees off. I tested it against another IR gun, home thermostat and an instant read thermometer. All three of the instruments were 1/2 degrees different from each other but the Geatex GXT 60 was at least 5 degrees lower from all three. What good is a thermometer if it can't give accurate readings? If it was maybe 1-2 degrees off I can maybe tolerate it but 5 degrees, no that won't do. I might have received a defective one but I'm not going to exchange it. I received it today and I'm sending it back tomorrow to Amazon for a full refund.
1,Didn't harden after 3 days.  Totally useless product.  Returned.
1,I have a version of this with only 4 protoboards on it rather than 6, but it is otherwise identical. Molded in is "Bread Board" across the top, and "SYB-118" at the bottom.		Terrible connections. I just tried to wire up three identical Joule Thief circuits on it. I tested each one as I wired it in. By the time I got to the third and applied power again, only the 2nd circuit worked. But even then, only after much wiggling of wires and checking of connections.		I stuck wires in many of the holes and measured the resistance, I found it would change drastically from an ohm to completely open just by slightly moving the wires. Completely useless.		The power connections at the top are horrible. They are those spring connectors you find on the back of cheap speakers. Not reliable with 22 gauge wire.		I pulled out my Radio Shack mini protoboard from 1980, blew the dust out, and it works. Why does a 36 year old protoboard outperform a brand new set of protoboards?
1,The picture is misleading. It shows a wheel that was machined. The actual wheel is made of sintered iron (looks like cast iron but it is easier to manufacture) and painted grey. It comes with all the pitfalls of chap casting, the major one being dimensional variability. There are more holes and smaller. The axle is bolt and nut - a plus because you can take it apart and add 10mm flat washers to stop the wheel moving from side to side. The bad part is that the wheel hole for the axle is not centered in the middle of the wheel and that the wheel hub side faces are not parallel to the wheel or to each other. So if you shim it with washers you will also have to clean the hub faces. Also the wheel hole for the axle is larger than the axle and even after shimming you will still get some side play. On the plus side is that the load is higher than the similar sized plastic wheels - the reason I bought them. You can also use more of them and mount them in a row to increase total load capacity while still maintaining maneuverability.	Unfortunately I could not find a better quality 2" fixed wheel with same load capacity even if I wanted to pay more.
1,MINE CAME IN TO MANY PARTS TO KNOW WHAT IT WAS
1,kind of works but is not very  rough scans....do not expect any help from the technical support. Yes they do contact but it takes for ever to get an answer. Even so i send them pictures...logs.....and scan files they hardly gave me technical information on what to do...you are on your own.
1,You get what you pay for. Buy a better one.
1,I read all the negative reviews yet I decided to take the chance. Needless to say, they were right! These things hardened way to quick and are almost impossible to work with.  I found the only way to use them was to use a heat gun on tin foil, but that makes them almost too hot to handle. For my use, these were not worth the trouble.
1,Works great for a brief period then starts being completely wrong. You have to remove the battery to reset it and it will work for another short period. It will read 16 degrees in my house when it's obviously near 70 degrees.
1,I don't know if it works or not. This is not the product I received
1,This roll is tangled. Constantly knots up about 1 - 2 hours into a print. I've gone through about a dozen rolls from multiple suppliers and this is the only tangled roll I've ever had to deal with.
1,This did not work for me. When I received the item it would not settle on any number, it kept jumping from 1 to ridiculously high numbers that can't possible be accurate. And it never settled into any number high or otherwise. When I pulled it back out of the water, it was still jumping all over the place instead of returning a stable value.		I did contact amazon about the issue and they graciously gave me a refund for the item. Instead I am going with a better but more expensive model/brand.		Update:	The company did contact me and offer a refund or replacement. As Amazon had already taken care of me it was unfortunately too late. Since the product did not function for me I have left my original review but the company has earned +1 star for their effort in trying to rectify the situation.
1,I bought a pile of MeltInk filament all at the same time when I bought my 3d printer. I have had nothing but issues. I finally bought some Inland filament and it worked beautifully the first print. Would not recommend.
1,As received the can of acrylic solvent cement had approximately 1 ounce of solvent in it compared to the 4 ounces that it should have contained. Either the can had a defective cap seal or it was not filled with 4 ounces originally.
1,Returned it.  The guide shaft goes through the center of the clamp where you'd hit if with your drill bit.  Poor design.
1,Do some research first if you're thinking about buying this printer. The first one I had worked for 4 days before the extrusion motor stopped working. The replacement stopped powering on after a month of use. The poor quality of these printers combined with horrible customer service from M3D make me regret purchasing this printer. Judging by the amount of complaints against M3D at the Better Business Bureau bbb.org, it appears I'm not the only one who feels this way.		This printer is guaranteed to break on you at some point and will require you to contact M3D. M3D customer support is impossible to contact and generally useless once you do get a reply. They will give you the runaround and ask you to perform pointless troubleshooting on the printer while taking 2-3 days to respond to any messages you might send. After troubleshooting via email inevitably fails, they will ask you to submit an RMA request. Their RMA process is a joke. They will charge you to send in your defective printer and initially promise to send a replacement within 2 days of receiving your defective printer. I've filed two RMAs with M3D and after constant follow-up on my end, the first replacement took 23 days to ship and the second replacement took 29 days to ship.		There are way better printers with much better customer support available for the same price as the M3D Micro. I would recommend staying far, far away from M3D.
1,Tap is completely defective, there is 0 lead angle on the threads (there is NO helix, see the attached picture) which basically turns this tap into a roughing end mill. I ended up destroying an expensive intake manifold trying to tap it. Upon closer examination each of the 4 lands is cut exactly the same, which instead of making 14 threads per inch, it would make 14 equally spaced grooves per inch.
1,As many reviews have said, this is heavy and does the job of weighting a Panavise.  However be advised that it measures 8 inches across!  Hope you are prepared to sacrifice this much bench space.  I preferred to simply fill the inside of the Panavise with steel shot and seal with a wood circle instead.
1,This was less accurate than a set; BestDealUSA A set of 100g Gram Chrome Calibration Weight for Digital Jewellery Scale.	The set was better, boxed and just a better buy.  I would not buy this again.
1,Mediocre quality - poor tolerance and fit. Do not recommend.
1,caustic!
1,i bought 2 spool black and white and tried both of them and not even 1 succesfull print. keep jamming my extruder or cloging the nozzle.. i bought bad fillaments but this one is worse
1,I ended up getting one, like previous reviewers, with a rattling screw inside and when I shook it this nice shiny M3 screw fell out.  I decided I am not even going to plug it up and just send it back for fear of a fire or something.		Basically this is a piece of junk so BEWARE!!
1,This pH meter is very jumpy it cannot lock in it's always flipping numbers what a waste of money
1,I ordered 3 cartridges, the first 1 worked fine.	The second two will nor work in my machine, i get the following message, even though they are authorized XYZ cartridges and the machine is able to read the material quantity.		"cartridge cannot be recognized"	Unable to identify the cartridge installed, printing parameters will not be changed.	Please replace a genuine XYZprinting cartridge and try again.		Now i am beyond the return window and am stuck with 2 defective cartridges.
1,Doesn't stay put
1,I got four of them and the thermistor on all 4 were shorted together when installed.  Trying to use 3 of them on a Diamond Head.  The insulation was crushed by the screws by the factory and shorted out the 2 wires.  I added some Kapton tape on both sides to prevent short.  Obviously who ever tightened the screw had no idea what they were doing.  Can't seem to get the Marlin temperature table figures out right yet but I will. Others are telling me this is crap.  I am thinking they right.  Still have not got Any to work without jamming.
1,Questioning the whole thing after the condition soon arrival, lots of clear tape with saw dust/wood chips and some kind of metal flake throughout the layers of tape and plastic. Re cycled acids?
1,Junk. Literally have to be on signal generator to set it off.  Junk build.
1,Product arrived broken. Please replace. Thank you
1,Quality of Solutech filament now varies greatly from order to order/spool to spool/color to color that it is no longer worth my paying a premium price.
1,Hopefully it was just from a bad batch, I've had to be super careful with this filament to get it to stick. It's the only filament that I've had trouble with. Luckily there are other fish in the sea...
1,Stopped working after 10 months. No joy getting it fixed or replaced.
1,When I first tried this scanner I thought Wow! The miracles of modern science.  It was right on, but it was all downhill from there. I re-read the manual, watched the videos, re-set the scanner to factory default.		  I built the wall so I know exactly what is behind it. Each scan was different. One scan showed PVC pipes which I finally realized was actually a mirror on the other side of the wall in the other room.  Live wires showed up where there were none.  Yes, I touched the wall in case there was static electricity.		There is a re-set button on the back. Big woop!  Just the S.O.S.  It isn't identified.  If you look on the back of the unit, where the warning label is, there is a circle by the French words certaines identifier.  You use something like a straightened paper clip to stick in this hole to re-set the scanner. That didn't get me much. The scanner started reading no contact with wall although all wheels were right on the wall where they had been for many scans before. I-800-4-DeWalt techs were unable to help. They referred  me to a number for manufacturer, repair, parts. THEY only had the manual not an actual scanner to look at. (sighwiping away tears of frustration).		Great idea but worthless if it doesn't work.  There is no way I would drill in to a wall with MY confidence meter pegging at zero.
1,These are not great for pools since the range is only whole increments  6, 7, 8.
1,Shattered in package, parts missing. Save the money. Would give 0 stars or less if possible.
1,what I expected
1,Will not hold, leaks.
1,These are junk. The contacts in many of the holes are slightly misaligned, so if you stick a wire in from the wrong angle it will jam and not go in. I wasn't even aware that this was an issue that breadboards could have before this. Do yourself a favor and get a different brand.
1,did not work as good as ones i have seen used on internet
1,Worked great...for about 10 seconds. Installed the sensor, used a 5v source, and began use at about 200psi. The sensor reported as expected for about 10 seconds, then went to 0. Now the sensor reads 0-.5v constantly.		I should have listened to the other reviews.
1,had some problems right out of the box with calibrations could not get it to zero in on 07 I do not recommend this product very poorly made
1,DO NOT BUY THIS FROM AMAZON, WENT TO USE PRODUCT AND IT WAS SOLID, COULD NOT EVEN PUNCTURE SEAL IN TUBE.	TOTALY USELESS. UNABLE TO READ FADED EXPIRATION DATE. LOVE GORILLA GLUE PRODUCTS BUT WON'T BUY THIS AGAIN ON LINE.
1,So basically, this tape is just a strip of plastic, which is why it can't be torn and needs to be cut with a razor blade. There's a cute little razor blade cutter included, which tucks into a pocket inside the roll itself. This scenario seems like an accident waiting to happen, and I'm not at all fond of it.		The tape itself is mediocre at best. Ok, so it can't be torn. Big deal! The adhesive itself is barely any better than standard duct tape, which isn't saying much.  Both are solidly inferior.  If you're looking for super strong adhesive tape, try Gorilla Glue Tape or U-Glue Fabric tape. The former is affordable, the latter is super expensive, however, they're literally like a super sticky glue in tape form, yet still can be removed (usually with ease) if needed.		Not impressed with this one.
1,Didn't work once for me. After opening it, I followed the calibration steps, and now the unit is stuck at the same pH level for every liquid.  Doesn't matter what liquid I put the unit into.  I tried different things like taking the batteries out and recalibrating it multiple times.  For ~$21, save your money and buy another product instead of this one offered by Xpert Omatic.  The premise is great but the execution fell short, at least for me.  One other thing to point out is that the calibration steps require the use of enclosed PH solution powders which are sold by Health Metric and those cost ~$7 for a 3-pak.  At some point, you will run out of the ones provided and will need to purchase the powders.  This product appears to be similar to what the shaving and printing companies are doing, selling you a cheap tool and then charging for the added necessary accessories to make up for the low tool cost.  I'm not sure if Health Metric and Xpert Omatic are one and the same company but just something to consider when you're purchasing this item.
1,Two of the nozzles "exploded" during use. The holes widen to around 2mm, making them unusable.		Would not recommend.
1,I ADMIT THE  TAPE IS DUCK. THE NFL LOGO IS WHAT YOU PAID FOR, THE AMOUNT OF TAPE IS WHAT PISSED ME OFF. NOT WORTH IT TO ME.  LIVE N LEARN.
1,These are not very bright.  I compared several LEDs for this wavelength range with a spectrometer. This one was very low power
1,Lasted a whole hole.  Get it, yeah, lame all around the board.  Butter knife likely better.
1,I did what the instructions said and microwaved these puppies to dry it out....even set it to low power (1) and microwaved for 60 seconds. They melted a bit, so I picked them up and the silica beads dumped out everywhere from a giant melted hole in the bottom. Garbage, absolutely NOT microwave safe.
1,I actually had to create a unique PLA setting just for this filament, because my standard setting did not work. I have to print slower, with a higher bed temperature (75C). My first layer is at 220C and then drops to 200C. I had to set ooze controls and alter my normal retractions settings. I finally got a decent print, but wasted a bit of filament to do so. I also needed to be more carful with support. Warpage and bed adhesion faults are common. I print on Glass and hairspray is an absolute must. Now I can print this as needed, and it does look nice, but at the higher cost for a small spool, doesn't make for a desirable product. More of a waste of time to have to fight with settings for a PLA. Not worth it, when I can spend half the money for twice the amount of filament from other venders. I would not recommend this product, just based on the cost alone, but add the frustrations of working with it, makes it even more of an issue.
1,Purchased it was completely dried up, but I didn't use it tell about two months after purchase so couldn't return.  Buyer beware.
1,Inaccurate O.D. 1/32" to large. Had to return.	Packaging was good.
1,I wanted so badly to love this stuff, but sadly I can't I used it with a hardened steel nozzle and a brass one, at every temperature in the advertised range and this stuff came out looking horribly every time. I tried in 5 degree increments from 190 to 230 and still no joy. The product might work on large flat surfaces but it is far too fibrous to work on any other surface. It does not do well with gaps and never evenly extrudes, I have used filled filaments before, everything from bronze and aluminum to wood, there is a trick usually to all of them to get the best out of it. I stopped trying to figure the trick out after 12 nasty looking prints, save your money and don't even try to go down that rabbit hole unless you are desperate for a large flat black cube that is surprisingly light and crazy expensive for what it is. Then this stuff is perfect. On to the quality issues. the diameter was spot on everywhere I tested it but you will need to rebuild your extruder drive system if you had setup to run TPU at some point. The brass feed teeth have a groove in them after very few uses and you would be better off with steel or at the very least have spares The steel extruder teeth that are best for this will cut the TPU but with withstand the abuse this filament puts them through. The spool however was junk, cardboard garbage that was made to look like you are getting a lot more than you are my spool weight was .41 kg upon arrival the cardboard must be 60+ grams so that means really you are getting .35 kg and a poorly wound .35 kg at that. It does produce a very cool look but it is not any stronger in my experience than PLA in fact in my tests the fibers run only one direction so if commonly failed at layer lines with 20 lbs of pressure on .5" solid peg. The Hatch box black PLA weighed in at 41% more and 1/5 of the price per KG and broke in the same hanging test (at roughly the same point of failure) with 78 lbs of strain unfortunately not flat black and no where near as cool to look at.
1,Not the quality you can relied on!  The crimp material is made of inadequate material SOFT ALUMINUM.  After the crimp, in 2 places on each side, the wire is not held secure, I pulled it out with little effort. This goes for all of these items I am reviewing.  When I was first hired after college, the guy I was assigned to sat me down with a pair of crimpers and 500 wires, for 18 gauge to 12 gauge, told me to put the proper crimp inline terminals on the end of the wire and call him when I was through. Needless to say, it took some time, strip, crimp and go to the next. Bob (his real name is Robert) came back sat down and proceeded to check each crimp using a pliers to pull on the crimp after wrapping the wire around a conduit pipe.  None could be pulled loose by him.  He looked at me and said: "You can work with me!"  We were together as a team for 4 years. I understand crimps, these are not crimps, the internal metal crimp appears to be SOFT ALUMINUM. This means you cannot solder them in a pinch and then slide the insulator on to the crimp and tape for a temporary fix.  NO I DO NOT RECCOMEND FOR ANY USE TO ANYONE for ANY JOB.
1,Title says it all.
1,Not so good, selection sucks...
1,Ordered this to measure humidity in our basement after doing crawlspace encapsulation to address a moisture issue.  According to this gauge, the humidity is 16%, maxing out at 21% in every room of our house, even inside the washing machine and my cigar humidor.  I drilled some extra holes in it to see if that'd help - nope, still reads a constant 16% and will occasionally jump to 21% for no apparent reason.  But hey, at least the temp reads correctly, even though that's not the stated purpose of the unit.  100% junk!!
1,a little oversized for most terminal blocks.
1,This is one of those situations where you can only wonder if the reviewers are real or not. These are literally pieces of junk. One was 95% dead out of the box, and another one had a bulb off-center so you get a tiny pin-sized light shining to the side (about 90 degrees off center), and then a dim light focused straight ahead. Essentially, two of them are completely worthless. The rest look like they won't last long before dying. They are cheap but are not even worth that much.
1,seems to be a decent jaw material, but like most of these I've tried, very weak magnets--get knocked out of your vise very easily--a true PITA	Why can't any of the vise jaw pad makers get decent magnets for their stuff?
1,I really like a clean floor and have a lot of experience with different vacuums.  The Shark Rocket Ultralight vacuum let me down.  The motor is on the top portion and is heavy; feels heavier than 7.5 pounds.  I had to keep switching hands as it got too heavy.  It can't be stood up in a closet.  It can be hung on the wall or taken partly apart to stand up in a small way; weird.  The good thing is the suction is very good.  Overall, I do not recommend and think this vacuum needs a major re-design, not to mention overpriced.
1,This item was purchased as a gift for me.  It has a 30 day manufacturer's warranty and Amazon's return policy expired in Nov of '12.  It is the #105 steth, but even though it is a budget model, it should still function properly.  Taps on the diaphragm are about the only thing you can hear.  I gave it one star because the sphygmomanometer works very well.
1,I initiated a return immediately after getting it.  It leaked oil and would not pump.  Terrible paint job all over and the relief valve was painted into position.  Obviously poor quality.  Thank God for Amazon returns.  It is all packed up and will mail it back tomorrow.  Looked for a higher quality bottle jack by reading the reviews on the site, seems they are all badly made.  So ordered a Craftsman, and will see.  Why isn't there a quality bottle jack at a reasonable price?
1,Purchased April 16th, and it's now June 4th and nothing has shown up. Tracked with no. provided and China Post shows no information.
1,Cheap!  Incredibly cheap!  The outer plastic thingies are pretty awful.  The metal is thin and cheap.  However, they were inexpensive and if they don't fail, they'll do.  Absolutely lowest quality, though.	[edit to add: these are a joke.  The inner barrel rotates independently of the outer barrels...  That is, the contacts move around when the tip is handled.  Garbage.  Do not use.  Fortunately, my application only requires TS, not TRS.  These are junk, FYI.]
1,This stuff is trash. Not sure what everyone else got but mine was so dry rotted to the point they broke off in the hole. After using all of them and got 4 out of 10 to take I was able to break the abs plastic plate off with the slightest of easy. Not trusting this crap to mount anything. Like a few other said I had to rebuy more of them from a hardware store and they worked fine. But these have been laying out in the sun way to long or there 50years old lol. Buy at your own risk.
1,I got this to replace my last hydrometer which I dropped. Checked its calibration in distilled water at 68F. Mine is off as it reads 1.002. No big deal. The other issue I have is that is is not correctly centered and always slopes slightly in the sample jar. I summary I am looking for a better one. I guess you get what you pay for. Overall a usable hydrometer but one that does not provide the accuracy I need. I was surprised to see it is calibrated at 68F and not 60F like my last hydrometer and my refractometer.
1,Often turns on by itself causing batteries to drain. Also when you click it on, the internals seems loose and the light flickers. Adjusting the spring on the battery helped a bit but it's back to turning on when IT wants to.
1,this unit drains the battery quickly. Imagine a situation of Nuke radiation around and to get this thing working you need to go to the shop frequently to get the battery!. Also, the user manual says there is an icon showing the backlight status. but there is none. and also there is no settings to program the backlight duration. the alarm sound compared to the yellow competitor is bad as well. it confuses people as it make the same old gritty sound. The reason why i did not buy the yellow competitor was bcoz it had tiny screen and no backlight. but apparently it seems to have better battery life, sensitivity and alarm sound. gonna send this one back and buy the yellow puppy.
1,There is a permanently marked label right on the front to tell you where to re order more signs.  Its prominent, right under the word 'surveillance'. I'm giving this otherwise alright product one star because the photo i looked at of it to buy it did not show the big reorder information.  I'm tired of subtle false advertising and tricks.  Just be honest and show the real picture.  How am i supposed to remove this silkscreened permanent ink? Acetone would dissolve the plastic enough to leave a streak.
1,Instead of the blue Rockler brand gauge shown, I received a white Drillspot brand gauge with a large label covering the gauge markings. The label was the kind with permanent adhesive. Attempting to remove the label left most of the label and adhesive stuck to the gauge. Using a chemical to remove the label might remove the painted gauge markings or damage the plastic. I contacted the seller (Drillspot) to give them a chance to fix the problem before I left negative feedback. They declined to take any corrective action and said to let Amazon deal with the problem.		The plastic gauge shipped loose without any type of packaging. With Drillspot's logo, phone and web address printed in large type on the gauge, it appears to be the type of giveaway item you get free at trade shows.
1,NOT WORKING
1,While this PEI surface on my printer bed is good for adhesion, I had serious problems getting this sheet to stick to either the aluminum bed or a glass plate even using 3M 468 adhesive.  The problem is that the sheet of PEI I received was warped about 1/2" over 12 inches length.  I did not think this was a problem and mounted it, then ended up stripping and remount it several times.		That small, permanent warp in this PEI sheet caused no end of problems with it lifting off the bed at the edges.  PEI is flexible but does not conform well and tension always existed at the edges.  A flat sheet from another supplier has not had this problem.  I'm testing to see if mounting it with the warp down will work any better, but frankly don't have much hope for it.  Perhaps what I got is an anomaly, but I've wasted a ton of time trying to get this particular product to work properly.
1,Cheaply Made, not tinned coated copper, many defect terminals in the bag. No information on where they're manufactured. I contacted the Absolute USA Inc. and received no response.
1,I used this product to fill 1/16" - 1/8" gaps on my house's siding last year when I repainted.  It's been 11 months since we painted and this Dap brand caulk is already failing in roughly 75% of the joints.  This stuff is terrible.		Update: reached out to DAP regarding their 40 year warranty and have heard nothing back.
1,Not like the sound proofing foam shown in the picture but like the foam used in the lid of a carry case. Two 3 inch thick pieces actually provide you with 3.5 inches of foam.
1,I bought this material to try. I've had good luck with most Hatchbox products, but not with this stuff. It seemed to extrude ok, and it stuck to the build plate, but after trying a handful of test prints I couldn't get the infill to come out good. After multiple bad prints I am going to stick with the PLA.
1,Not one out of four work.  No quality control, none were even tested. This is the case with so many items from china. No response from vendor or from amazon.
1,came with missing sliders, broken pieces although box not damaged, looks really cheap. Ok for a kids room. Not durable enough for tools, flimsy. Wish I'd bought the metal version for $10 more. I would not buy this again or recommend it.
1,These are trash. I tried getting several of them to work but was completely unsuccessful - would not recommend for anyone.
1,Trash
1,very thin and narrow, cheap quality
1,I tried to use this file to sharpen self feed wood boring bits and it didn't cut very well, actually the bit dulled the file. Maybe I need a diamond file for self feed bits, but this file isn't hard enough to cut that steel.
1,Too hard and sharp.  I felt worried to use it, even on a 5 year-old because one wrong move... they flinch on you and the tip will pop right into their eardrum.  All of the tips are too pointy, it's like they designed them to go all the way to the eardrum.  With correct optics, you shouldn't have to go that deep.  Wish I would have sent this back before my return period was up.
1,Bad all small most to small
1,We have used many Jason products safely and have become a fan. However, there is something with these new formulas for kids' toothpaste that is going the wrong path. We have noticed allergic reactions.		The ingredients are: Glycerin, aqua (purified water), silica, xylitol, xanthan gum, panthenol, aloe barbadensis (aloe vera) leaf juice, calendula officinalis flower extract, calcium carbonate, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, natural flavor * certified organic vegetable source. It seems that we might be allergic to sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, which is used in lieu of sodium lauryl sulfate as a replacement surfactant.		For future orders we shall cross off this toothpaste in our shopping list.
1,When it worked it worked well from 140khz to 660khz. Fed test signals over the appropriate  range of the meter it failed to lock on any frequencies outside of that range. My unit was nearly useless for anything but 2 meter.		Now a few weeks after it arrived, it will only indicate "no signal".		I used a ten dollar gift certificate to get it, so I'm out five bucks. I wouldn't have taken a chance on such a low rated product if it weren't that my risk was so low. After fifty years of electronics purchases, I can safely say this is this the least useful product I have received to date. Save your fifteen dollars and put it towards a unit in the fifty to one hundred dollar range to avoid frustration.
1,I ship around 35-50 packages daily, sometimes even more. As a one man shop I have to find packaging items that can save me time, money, and grief. The quality control of these rolls is extremely bad. Some rolls I have had are good, meaning the tape "flows" off of the reel with ease and others it takes effort to pull the tape off the roll by hand on my tape gun. Sometimes on the "harder to release" rolls, the adhesive seems to 'lift' off of the tape as well. Some boxes I have to tape with two rounds of tape, very time consuming and this tape isn't cheap either.		I've used 3m (great but expensive) and I've used Metronic 2.0 Mil Thick 2 Inch x 110yd tape (thin but great to work with) along with this brand. This is my 2nd foray, as I've read all the reviews but this is the last time I'll be using this garbage. The metronic and 3m are more expensive but in the long run, the cost savings are not worth it.
1,It was not dark green
1,Mostly small compression spring that are supposed to be medium sized.	Bought 2 boxes and think I only got 3 tension type springs. SMH
1,I've tried for years to find the rubber tape I used in the US Navy for weatherproofing outdoor connections.  This is not it.  This is not the triangular shape and it is very, very, thin.  I would really like to identify the manufacturer and part for what we used in the Navy.  All the stuff I see online is not the same; it all appears to be cheap imitations but not the original.
1,This did not have the correct holes for my Wanhao Duplicator i3 V2.1 so I had to return it. It looked solidly built however.
1,When the package arrived I opened it and found the inner plastic bag was black with dust.  On pouring it out what I found was lots of bits of Magnet dust and chunks of the original Ferrite core.  Not even one out of the 10 was intact.  I had to swap magnets from good ones to make 3 complete units.  I took pictures but Amazon no longer lets people upload product pictures.		DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THESE!  They don't even bother to snap shut the plastic cases before shipping, so the ferrite cores drop out and then break up against each other. They are shipped in a flimsy envelope so there is no way they will survive.	I bought a ten pack of the 5mm and the 9mm and they both arrived in the same condition.
1,I have purchased two of similar units of this type, and both times I was thoroughly unimpressed. With MANY heating units it simply doesn't work. I have contacted them and they were unable to help.
1,Does not fuse. Rips like paper. Doesn't stretch. I used "rescue tape" and F4 and they actually worked. I used other colors from this company and none of them worked.
1,they are not that sharp....they break very easy.
1,I have issue with material quality. When printed with  a model with same layer heights.	Material extrusion is not consistent leaving gaps and holes because of material quality.	Printing same model with different material yield better result.	Buy with caution.
1,Update	Monoprice replacement warranty is a lie. They don't have the priner in stock for two months and would not replace it with another model. waited for printer to be in stock and missed Amazon return window. They have changes ETA several times since April on their website.		DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER. IT IS $220 GAMBLE.		--------	The has many issues - prints don't stick because I got a plate warped in middle and I have been printing with a raft mostly in a corner part for straight prints. The printer stops at random before completing and no way to restart from where it left. It has wasted a lot of filament when I leFt it unattended on a print and just made a big jjngle of filament. It doesn't retract filament correctly hence always has an extra line or a missing line. Monprice cistomer service is worst - asked me to wait till it is in stock and changed date twice. Refused a paid upgrade. Will probably return it to Amazon for refund.
1,Not very sturdy, bend too easy. Spend more money and get a better product.
1,I didn't buy this for any immediate need, rather an ongoing use as needed. I haven't had a chance to actually measure a bore yet but, It COULD earn another star if only it had instructions in English.
1,My order wasn't so great.  1 was dead on arrival.  Amazon return started.  No way to contact seller to avoid the return.  The 2nd from the order works.
1,Despite what they say this ONLY works with Windows PCs.  The software for Mac and Linux is worthless.  Even if you can make it work it lacks 90% of the features of the PC version.
1,It would be a good holder, but the holes for the screwdrivers get progressively smaller from back to front. Therefore, the ones I use most of the time have to go in back, which makes them less accessible. For six bucks I won't return it, but I won't be using it either. It will get donated to Goodwill.
1,This is some of the worst filament I have ever used, completely filled with air bubbles. DO NOT BUY this filament complete garbage.
1,low quality connector suitable for extremely low voltage connections. Any connection that draws amps, DON't use this low quality item
1,I made the mistake of not listening to the reviews. The wheel I received was unusable. It was not only so far out of balance to make it horribly dangerous, it was also out of alignment making it unstable left and right. I will try to return, but not sure its worth it because of the return shipping.
1,Failed after 30 days, so I can't return it.  I would not buy it again.
1,Absolute garbage don't waste your money ive been ordering alot of different bearing from amazon and these are the worst ive come across if you're planning on putting any thoughts on these they will not work and I mean any pressure at all
1,Difficult to open and close,  The closure strip is very thin and fragile.  Not good for bagging small parts repetitively,because they don't easily open with one hand as a zip lock should by sliding finger and thumb in opposite directions.
1,I usually don't have issues with the Hatchbox ABS filaments although I did have issues with their silver which has identical issues with this glow in the dark filament. This filament seems particularly brittle and I've actually broken pieces of it several times just loading it into the extruder head. This appears to be compounding the problem of it clogging the extruder nozzle while printing. It would print OK for a while and then the nozzle clogs and thus cannot extrude anymore and has to be cleaned. Unfortunately I learned about this after the return period passed and thus cannot return the unused filament which also cost extra being that it's a special filament being glow in the dark.
1,Let me start by saying, we ownfour Dyson's at this point. The DC 50, is the weakest link in all of the vacuums we purchased in the last 10 years. It constantly gets clogged with pet hair. I believe this is the design flaw as the dirt gets caught in a small opening that goes into the container. If by chance you vacuum up a pen top or something small that is solid, it will immediately clog that opening. Also the handles extremely flimsy and twist around and gives a very insecure feeling. I would stay clear of this model.
1,Good luck, I only received 1 of the 25 promised.  On the bright side, it seems to be really make well made. ;)  .........still waiting on my refund.
1,Bought this in August and it quit working  Worked great till then.
1,really? look it is missing a tooth it failed as expected - as the weld was not good.  No good!
1,It only shrinks 2 to 1 so unless you can find a piece almost exactly the size to fit over the wires, it won't shrink enough to be practicable.
1,I really wanted this to work out.  I actually do need the larger print size the Robo offers. There were good reviews, and several bad reviews.  I believed that Robo's customer service would help me out if there was an issue.  HOWEVER, the first printer we received would start to print, and around 10 minutes into the print it would just shut down.  A few minutes later, the software would notice the temperatures falling and report a failure.  Obviously the temperatures fell, the printer had shut itself down.  When I contacted Customer Service they seemed stuck on the idea that it was a clogged extruder, which it wasn't.  It took me 2 go-arounds with them to get them to realize that the temperature was not the issue, the temperature errors the software was reporting was an effect rather than a cause.  The printer had been extruding fine, then Bang, the thing shut down.  I thought the printer was defective, and since Tech Support was out at a convention, Level 2 was not really responding.  I initiated an Amazon exchange, sent the unit back, and Amazon sent me a new printer.  Then, the 2'nd printer did THE SAME THING!  Long story short, it looks like Robo had some units with marginal power supplies, and I managed to get two of them.  Tech Support offered to send me a power supply, it would take a week or so to ship to me, but I decided they had some Quality issues at the time and I didn't want to be stuck with a lemon, going back and forth with Robo's Tech Support.  I returned the 2'nd printer to Amazon and got another brand (which is working fine).  Unfortunately I will not have the print volume I had wanted.
1,Only works with universal type motors.
1,Sorry but not impressed with this stuff, let it get tacky like the directions state, put together and held in place just in case for 2 minutes. Withing a few minutes my feather lite drink holders were falling on the floor. Had to use screws. It might be a fine sealant but certainly useless as glue. Perhaps I was using it for an application it was not intended for. I didn't think so.
1,Made my own gaskets to fix leaks on my car.  worked great.		--update--		Originally this worked great, was easy to cut and shape.  But I've used it to make a gasket for a small piece on my car and the rubber becomes hard and brittle and fails after only 6-9 months.  I would not recommend this for use on a car that sits outside all day.
1,I wanted regular white, but they're out. This stuff looks weird, failed on my printer several times and I'm dialed in and rarely have failures. When it doesn't fail its stringy and needs lots if sanding, love this brand and only use this brand but hate this product.
1,I have tried different brands without any incident but with this particular brand did hes of seems to wear off so quickly
1,It melts slowly and will leave a film on whatever your trying to scuff up
1,The radius of the eye is much smaller than the recommended bend radius of the 1/8 cable.  The radius of the Loos eye will reduce the strength of the 1/8 cable by nearly 50 %  DO NOT use this item.  It is an extreme safety hazard.
1,I mounted these on a wooden work table. They initially loved them as they are easily set and released and are rock solid. Unfortunately one of the lock mechanisms failed after a couple of months. They design seems pretty flimsy. I will follow up on this review after a few more months.
1,Since I purchased both this and the Eva-Dry I will use this review to compare the two. This pales in comparison to the Eva-Dry E-333. If money or space is super tight maybe this is a good option but otherwise the Eva-Dry is superior in every way except that it takes up more space (it's about 6"x6"x1.5").		Reasons:		It holds 100g of silica gel		It has a heating unit that dries it out by plugging it into the wall vs baking in an oven for hours		It has a hanger attachment		The window is easy to see the color of the silica - This unit I could barely see through the dark window to see the color		The construction is much better - This one was almost separating at the edges and pink fluid was leeching out of the sides onto a paper towel once it was full
1,adhesive isn't  better than ordinary.  maybe i got an old one, but is even less sticky than another roll of ordinary duct tape i have.
1,Save your money!!! Feels like I could crush the male ends of the quick connect and the couplers feel like they hardly even make a connection. Complete junk.
1,These things are awful... The damaged my Camaro after they slid out from under it when I was driving up them... They were then too damaged to use anymore... A waste of money and time...
1,This scanner is worthless. I cannot think of one practical application given its awful resolution and scanning quality.
1,I have a Delta saw with a 4 inch sawdust outlet and I have not been able to find anything that will allow me to size it down to a Craftsman vacuum hose size.  I thought this was made smaller on each end to accommodate a 4 inch hose connection; thus, I could attach another device to this one to size down the saw outlet.		Wrong.  This is exactly 4 inches in diameter.  Another fitting that is also 4 inches will not fit it.		Guess I am stuck.  I don't see how this would make anything into a quick disconnect unless what it is attaching to is more than 4 inches in diameter.		AD2
1,Serrated jaws do not align and close completely when fully engaged.
1,The vise shattered on its first serious use. Clamping the barrel of a Mini-14 rifle to secure a loose flash suppressor and POW! the piece shown in blue, below the rifle barrel in the photo, broke off. This caused the vise to flop around unsecured on it's base, making it difficult to complete my task.
