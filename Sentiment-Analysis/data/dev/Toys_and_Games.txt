0,Love Melissa and Doug. These toys are no exception. Sturdy and colorful. Perfect for my one year old.
0,My daughter has enjoyed this play set.  She loves My Little Pony, so she was very excited to get it.  There are lots of little pieces included.  I'm okay with that, but if you have a smaller child that likes to put things in their mouth, you want to take this into consideration.  The parts are all plastic, which I expected, and set up was very easy.  Everything shown on the box was in the set including one pony.  I would recommend it if you have a My Little Pony fan.
0,Already having fun with my staff changing the expressions displayed on my desk!
0,My daughter really loves this puzzle! She plays with it for 20-30 minutes at a time - which is amazing for being only 13 months old! Her hand eye coordination - fitting the pieces in - is getting better all the time, and she loves hearing about the animals and their sounds. She especially likes the lion! It is a great first puzzle!
0,Average puzzle, colorful, cute. A little pricey, but these puzzles are well made and they all run about the same price.
0,We always take this game on our family trips.  My 11 yr old loves that she can play along with equal success as the adults.  My mom, who is not the best at trivia loves it, and it offers enough though provoking subject matter that even trivia fans will enjoy it.  Plus it's just funny to see what everyone comes up with as their answer.  We always come away with some great one-liners and lots of laughs.  Also, the number of players is so flexible as is controlling the length of the game, i.e. number of cards needed to win.
0,Good enough!
0,fantastic item the kids loves it
0,Absolutely adorable! Love that the cow's nose is made of soft cordoroy material. The cow bell zipper pull is also a nice touch. It is also surprisingly roomy. I manage to fit a sandwich, a bag of chips, an ice pack, caprisun, a jello or pudding cup, and more. Plenty of room for a child of any age's lunch. These definitely last the whole school year and look good as new when I run them through the wash. Highly recommended!
0,Great plush for my care bear fan 3 year old daughter.
0,This helps but if your landing in grass I would recommend the landing gear stabilizers
0,a lot of fun
0,Grandson enjoyed putting together and playing with.
0,I love Melissa & Doug products and this doesn't disappoint.  The puzzle is bright and colorful and a little more challenging for my 6 year old but it is something we can do together.
0,Extremely Soft and Cute! My son loves it!
0,My kids love the mask. Got it for a great price as an add-on during the x-mas season.  Good quality, comfortable size and fit. Would buy again as long as the price is right.
0,My son plays magic, How do you review a card?	This card was very useful against most decks.  He was happy to find it on Amazon for a decent price.  He trades cards and the cards he buys here hold their value. This card takes out most creatures for a turn that your opponent controls
0,Has made solo RPGing with cards so much easier.  Highly recommended.
0,Wonderful doll.  This line of dolls is just freaking awesome.  If you like Monster High, you will like this doll very much.  My only complaint is the same as I have with almost everything I get from Amazon...the packaging is horrible.  My box has slight damage because it was not packaged well....but the doll itself, is great!!!
0,Awesome
0,10/10 would build the UltraCopter again.
0,this dino is cool, but huge. my kid wants to keep it in his room but its a bit unruly and doesnt stand up that well. but he adores it, and its his, sooo its cool.
0,Grandson has enjoyed playing with this kit. He's seven and had no trouble following the instructions and putting together the various machines.
0,Daughter loves it
0,My daughters are 2 and 3 and they LOVE this. They have toys similar to this in the waiting room of their doctor's office and they were SO excited to see us putting one up at home. It comes mostly assembled. It took us literally less than 10 minutes to put together. As soon as we did the girls started playing with it. And it wasn't a play with it for 10 minutes and forget it either. They played with it from the time we put it together (right after dinner) until bedtime and they were SO mad when we told them it was bedtime we had to promise them they could play with it in the morning. There are so many activities and it's big enough for both of them to play with at the same time so there is no fighting over it. And the quality is definitely superior. This is one of those toys you save when your kids grow out of it to give to your grandkids one day.
0,My grandson loved it.
0,Absolutely perfect !!!
0,I bought this for my son's high chair and it has been just what we needed to help keep him distracted as we prepare his meals. The suction cup keep it securely attached to the high chair. We leave it attached during feedings, so he sometimes plays with it and gets food on it but we haven't had any issues with it being a big distraction from his food. It sometimes needs to be washed, so I just rinse it under running water in the sink. Its not sealed well, so some water may get inside of it but it dries up pretty quickly.
0,This building science kit is as fun as it is educational.  All of my kids, from 2-year-old boy to my 36-year-old husband, are entertained by the catapults and crossbows.  My husband, older kids and I enjoyed constructing the experiments, and my little ones also enjoyed putting the pieces together to build their own little projects. We first built a catapult (#10 in the manual) and my kids practiced shooting the foam ball for over an hour.  Best babysitter ever, since the foam balls can't cause damage to anything and the catapults are durable to withstand tug of wars.  Occasionally, a wheel or small piece would fall off from the abuse, but it was easily repaired.	The 32-page, full-color manual contains 10 different building projects, the history of each type of catapult or crossbow, and physics lessons for each experiment.  It is helpful to spend some time familiarizing yourself with the first couple pages of the manual (tips and kit contents) before you begin building.  This will make for a smoother constructing.
0,Works fine, and the battery life is decent, too. For the price, it's a good toy, and durable so far. The remote lets you swim it around in several directions, but it doesn't dive down under the water--just stays near the surface with its dorsal fin sticking out. Also, be aware that the shark isn't very big--about 5 or 6 inches long.
0,Beatiful. My grandson loved it
0,My daughter received this as a gift for her 2nd birthday and it's still a favorite toy almost a year later. We honestly don't use the MP3 feature very often and I'm not even sure the microphone still even works...but she loves just playing the songs and singing them over and over again.
0,The handles are too soft and broke in half the first time I used it; otherwise, it's a fun product.
0,Great learning puzzle
0,When the new Oz movies came out my granddaughter started watching the original movie.  I wanted to get her the full set of figures, but that would have been a really great expense.  My daughter cleaned out old boxes of toys and found several of the Madame Alexander pieces given out at McDonald's  We were missing some, so I went on line to see what I could find.  Barbie Tommy as the Mayor is just a little bit different sized, but not enough to notice.  And my grand daughter was really pleased with him.  He is cute with his little moustache and pocket watch.  And quite affordable.
0,Fantastic game, however you can't play this with just two people, no matter what some of the reviewers said. I played it at a family reunion last summer with about 6 or 7 other people and it was a lot of fun.
0,Bought this for my 11 yr old the instructions were very easy to follow the pieces lock very well. The final product is very strong. Anyone wanting military building blocks I would recommend this product.	I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest review
0,This wooden ramp is a beautiful wooden toy, and also well made.  It will be a favorite of my Grandson, I am sure.  I would buy it again.
0,Grand kids not playing with trains
0,excellent quality. Even the Velcro is great quality.
0,We have had two of these (purchased another because we left the first one in a hotel). The bus itself is high quality, but the plastic attachments do not last long, especially with a 3-4 year old and daily use. He still loves it, even with a missing stop sign and door.
0,Love that this seller has so many unique colors that cannot be purchased in a store. Thank you for helping make my best friends' bridal shower unique and personalized.
0,My son loves playing with this lightning McQueen with his Dusty Crophopper plane.
0,awesome!
0,Great tool set my grandson loves it.
0,They are great. I have a ball pit and one bag was not good enough. I have to buy about 600+ balls
0,Such a great purchase for my 18 month old son. He plays with this all the time and loves putting things in the "oven" and on "the grill". I highly recommend this toy for any little boy or girl.
0,Great Product.  Quick Service.  Excellent Communications.  Rated AAA+++.  Thank You.  BEG
0,More beautiful in person.  Love this doll!
0,This was a Christmas gift for my daughter and I can tell you that she absolutely loves it!  I would recommend this item!
0,Great puzzle!!!
0,Cool details like all of the Monster High Dolls.
0,Fits the Build a Bear bears well, pretty standard quality for that store's products.
0,Was everything our four year old grandson expected. (He knows his Rescue Bots!)
0,Exactly what was ordered. :)
0,Amazing tool ! ! !  More compact, accurate and more GOODER than I expected !
0,outstanding!
0,I was surprised at how challenging this game was!  I played with a 15 year old and (2) 12-year olds - and although we all had fun - we were amazed with how hard it was at times.		It took a while to figure out the rules/play style - but once we did - the game moved quickly.  The way the words are written down just really messes with your mind - and it's hard to focus on the sounds of the words rather than the actual written word.  (I found that I did better when not sounding them out loud - by running them a few times in my head first.)  And - there was no rhyme or reason to who got what.  Meaning - there was one card that I could not figure out for the life of me - but my son got it in a second or two.  The next time around - he was completely stumped.		Some knowledge of common phrases helps a great deal - and I wouldn't play it with kids any younger than 12.		But it was fun - and will continue to be until we run through all the cards.
0,As someone that likes to tell stories, sometimes you reach a writer's block. That's where this Writer Emergency Pack comes in handy.		 THE CARDS 	There are two "sets" of cards. Twenty-six numbered cards have illustrations on them, with a concept on it, like "Cause and Effect", "Stack of Needles", "Start the Clock". Then there are twenty-six numbered cards that correspond to those [see photos]; these have more detailed information about the concept, with several questions to ask yourself on the back that relates to the concept. That's fifty-two cards total, with two explanation cards.		 HOW TO USE 	When you're writing and you're stuck with what to write, you randomly draw an illustrated card from the deck and read the corresponding explanation card. You then use that concept to figure out what to write. You obviously don't need to follow the initial card and can choose another, but the randomness does allow for a challenging and possibly more exciting writing.		 SUMMARY 	Even if creativity flows through you, having an open mind, or even seeing other ideas and concepts, can expand your creativity. These cards will definitely give you more ideas to think about. And good ideas are priceless. Recommended.
0,If you're tired of Candyland and Chutes & Ladders, you should give Hiss a try!  Nothing overly complicated, just good family snake building fun!  You do need a little room to spread out the pieces, but it is also a great size game to take when traveling.  Our family has game night once a week and all of us (Mom, Dad, 6 year old boy, 3 year old girl) love it!
0,It worked well, kind of basic compared to the others we have bought.
0,excellent for what we needed
0,DO NOT CHANGE SIDE CHARGE WIRING until you confirm with volt meter.	Yes, it appears at first the two side adapters are wired different, but they checked correct with the meter.	1. Push the battery and side connectors into the charger and they will be loose. Push a little harder to continue. The pins will lock in place.	I believe the plugs will loosen after charging a few times.	2. It took about 45 minutes to top off the batteries, all at one time. The lights turned off when the batteries were charged.	3. The 500 mAh batteries weight 0.65 ounces.	These 780 mAh batteries weight 0.68 ounces.	They fit into my Syma X5SW well with no effort. I haven't checked the flight time as yet.
0,Fun game.  Brings back memories to my childhood when I had one.
0,A hit
0,I was hesitant to order her (she was not available in my country) as she didn't appeal to me much, but having her in hands I feel differently! I like Holly much more now than I thought I could, she's nice and colourful too! I'll give her a 4/5 and I'd recommend her. I'd really love for more dolls in this line in particular. :)	(My doll did come with an eye-wonk however. I could cry as she's such a nice doll!)
0,For craft projects you really cannot beat these foam glitter stickers.  The kids love them and they are easy to use and well worth the money.  Packaged well and arrived as promised.  Would buy from this vendor again.
0,My son loves these! They aren't flimsy or junky. He wears them all the time!
0,I ordered this toy for my cousin's toddler, who is just a bit over 16 months old.  Joey adored the toy from the very beginning.  He quickly caught on, with the help of older brother Brandon (who is nearly five), how to keep the puppy reading and singing by turning the pages of the book.  In fact, it was Brandon who figured out the toy and taught Joey how to use it completely, a testament to the user-friendliness and age-appropriateness of this toy.  I thought the price might be a little high, but I must say it had provided hours of fun and laughter, as well as a good learning experience for Joey.  I would guess that this would make a good "from the grandparents" toy, simply because of the price.  I definitely recommend it--and the batteries are included, something I wish would become industry standard.		Update:  After speaking with people who are more accustomed to purchasing toys than I am, I am going to change my opinion of the price.  One person I spoke with said, "Thirty five bucks?  For a puppy that sings and reads and moves?  That is really reasonable."  So I think I may be living in the previous century when it comes to price.  This is a delightful toy, and I think any toddler would love it.
0,My grandson loves this.
0,Its a great product to buy its not just for beginners its also used just for that extra protection
0,Haven't gotten to use these yet but they are so cute!  Perfect for thomas cupcakes.
0,Very cute dolls and very well made.  I'm sure they will hold up through quite a few "Dammits".
0,bought for my GS.  He wanted a baby b/c his sister had a baby.  He loves her.
0,neat
0,for a neon glow theme party- good variety of items
0,My 10 month old absolutely loves this walker!
0,Very light skinned AA doll. More Hispanic/Native A looking . The dog works well and shakes when you press his head down. The dog and tub were a good size. Nicer than expected.  My 4 year old liked the soap bottle, scrubber and little towel. Cute gift.
0,son loves it!
0,Zoo Talkers are a hit with my granddaughter.  Wish they would produce the older zoo with the talking animals.
0,She's very beautiful and the box was in great condition! Thank you!
0,Granddaughter loved it.
0,Really fun for our science birthday party.  We used this at our party to show another way to complete a circuit. The kids loved it. It was a party of 5 year old boys.
0,Our 10 month old loves this book!
0,I LOVE this toy. My daughter is 16 months old and has been playing with it for a few months. We're working on the ABCs with her and it teaches the letter, sound and sings songs. I bought this because she is still putting things in her mouth and the magnets are too large to swallow and they're housed inside the plastic letter so they can't come loose and be lost or swallowed. It occupies her for a little while while I cook. I taught her to move them from the fridge and put them on the dishwasher so that gets her moving from one end of the room to the other and keeps her occupied a bit longer. I love this product so much I would definitely buy this as a gift and I've told many parents about it.
0,Purchase as a gift. Was well received.
0,Just a typical beanie boo, although the owl's face is a bit lopsided  (not noticeable to my son, so not a big deal) so I gave it 4 rather than 5.
0,Grandson loved it.  He added it to his Webkinz collection.
0,Perfect little figurines for the Pokemon lover in you.
0,My daughter loves loves loves this tea set.  It truly is bigger than most of the other tea sets that I have seen out there and perfect for small children.  Yes, it is porcelain (or ceramic, *Breakable*) but my 3year old and 5year old understand this and use the extra care necessary.  We did have a friend over with her 2year old that was a little rough on it, but we escaped with no broken pieces surprisingly.  Several of the pieces were dropped or even "thrown" across the table and not a crack in them.
0,Shredder is one of my favorite turtle villians he looks great !
0,Got it today and although the description says 8 years and up, the pkg itself says 15 years and up. Have a hard time believing this will for my 10 year old. Will update when he comes home and he tries it on.	_______________________________________		So we used this for trick or treating and we had an issue with the comfort of it, my son kept complaining that it hurt his head, so he carried it around and put it on when he walked up to people's doors. The adjustable insert inside-- you have to hold it in place with duct tape- not an issue but just wanted to throw it out there. And although the pkg said 15 years and up, with the insert inside, it fit well and pretty much stayed in place. It's literally a cardboard box and in my opinion, was way over priced. But was a huge hit at trick or treating.
0,Got this for my 5yr old nephew a couple months ago, who has adhd.  this was per the suggestion of his counselors at school who said he might need a fidget toy. he liked it...but i can't say it kept his attention.  he liked to comb his hair with it mostly and play with it in the bathroom sink (i had to wash the soap off of it).  he also liked to put it in his mouth. My nephew is not on medication, though.  I'm wondering if the other reviewers kids are??  and if that is the difference.  I plan to introduce him to it again and will follow up with this review if results are different or the same.
0,This was a gift and the girls loved it.
0,My 4 year old Granddaughter was tickled pink when she opened this on Christmas morning.  She said, I LOVE bow and arrows.  :-)
0,This is a great set for any girl that loves  her Monster High! It even has a little cash register.
0,Looks great in the dark with a black light.
0,Received these cute walkie talkies in the mail today. We got them for our boys for Christmas but of course my husband and I played with them today to make sure they worked and everything. They worked great!! I love how they are very easy to use, even for small hands, I love how they have a clip on them so my boys can clip them onto their jeans, but my absolute favorite thing about the walkie talkies is that you can use headphones with them if you want!! How cool is that?! I've never seen that feature on walkie talkies before. Great Toy!! Perfect Christmas present!! Thanks!!
0,My son got a set of FNAF plush for Christmas. Foxy is so well made and is really a cute stuffed animal! He has them lined up on a shelf in his room.
0,I like it real well . My granddaughter fell at a amusement park .	And she received a concussion on her head. A worker fell on her she wanted to pick her up, and she slipped and fell on her.	The Hospital gave her a cat in the hat.	Now she has one here and at her house.	But she still brings hers .	The tag is wearing out on hers though.	I'm just glad I have a spare.	She was almost 2 at the time now she's almost 4 .	Cat in the Hat :-)yep! Had to get it even if just for the tag:-)
0,adorable!
0,This is fun. My daughter likes that it swims around and I like that it keeps her from freaking out when I put her in the tub.
0,THESE ARE FUN AS FAR AS MY SON IS CONCERNED, LOL THEY WORK GREAT A FUN TOY, BUT THEY COULD BE MADE A LITTLE BETTER. A FEW OF THEM THE HANDLE PART BROKE OFF BECAUSE WHEN U DROP THEM OR THROW THEM AS THEY LAND IT CRACKS. I HAVE WALL TO WALL CARPET SO THATS REALLY BAD. HOWEVER, MINOR AND MY SON LOVES THESE TOYS. DRIVES ME CRAZY BUT WHAT ELSE IS NEW
0,A beautiful doll with two extra outfits which I found was well made. Non-bendable legs though.
0,christmas gift
0,We were looking for something to hold our kids stuffed animals that was practical. We saw this and thoght what a really neat idea. Not only are the stuffed animals stored safely, but now the kids have chairs when watching movies or just hanging out. The quality is really good and has held up really well. Highly recommend this product.
0,My kids hate bugs but love these!
0,Great product! My 7 month old loves it!
0,I bought this to play on lunch break with coworkers. I was worried about the pieces being too light, but we have not had any issues with pieces falling. I attached some pictures for size reference.
0,Boys love this! Got for a great price and put one aside for a gift! Thanks! Good indoor play for active kids!
0,fits perfect for my toys, make everything so organized.
0,Great Quad with built in camera. Flies well and handles good too.

0,We were given this bubble machine for my son's 2nd birthday last summer.  We accidentally left it on the back porch and it was rained on.  Needless to say...it did not withstand a rain storm.  So, I came on amazon and ordered this same product!  I was SOOO thankful they sold it! We always bring in the machine now when we are done. They do sell this brand at Target but not this actual model.  I prefer this model over the others.  This bubble machine produces the BEST bubbles and the MOST. I've had and seen other kinds of machines and they don't come close to comparing to the Gazillion one.  I HIGHLY recommend this for any young child who loves bubbles.  It's the ultimate bubble machine!  Beware though, you will want to purchase more Gazillion bubble refills for this machine.  We tried cheap bubble liquids at Target and they didn't go a quarter the distance or get as big.  Target stores do sell Gazillion bubble refills for much cheaper than Amazon. I'm SOLD on Gazillion bubble machines and refills!
0,Very cute! My son loved them and they didn't shed too bad.
0,Couldn't be happier, thanks:)
0,Perfect. No issues with the box or dolls inside!
0,Comes in a great sturdy box.  Kids and adults love it.  Fair price.
0,My boys love this! Very durable.
0,My 20 month old dances around in the bubbles it makes for as long as I keep it on and the batteries seem to last a little while too!
0,Great product only downside and why it didn't get 5 stars was the batteries they were not only dead as soon as i received the product but they were starting to corrode around the connections! Once changed product has worked great
0,Nice little charger for the drone pilot with a lot of 3.7V batteries. Does the job and only needs one USB port to charge a handfull of batteries at once. Includes adapters so you can charge using two different styles of battery connectors at the same time!  Sweet!
0,Let's face it - the main reason to purchase this Lightning McQueen model is the cool sign that comes with it, that actually clips onto the front of McQueen so he can "sneak up" behind it, just as he used it in the original "Cars" movie to hide behind while trying to sneak into the Rust-eze tent undetected!  If you've been collecting these 1:55 scale diecasts for a while, you've already seen this model as part of a 2-pack with Fred, but it's kind of a neat accessory your youngster might get a kick out of if you don't already have numerous McQueen models.		If you're a parent/grandparent who's just beginning to look at these diecasts and wondering what the differences are Mattel's and Disney Store's diecast models, we've experienced both as part of the ever-growing collection we began for our grandsons back in 2012.  A typical Mattel McQueen model like this one measures @ 3"L x 1-1/2"W x 1"H, while a 1:43 scale model from Disney Store typically measures @ 4"L x 2"W x 1-1/3"H, with a noticeably higher metal concentration.  That might lead you to believe Disney Store's would be the preferable models, but - at least in our experience - we've never had to use super glue on our Mattel models for things like spoilers, etc., while we've always felt they should include a tube of it with Disney Store's since it's pretty much a necessity!  Both have great attention to detail, and we love the looks of our Disney Store models - they just haven't held up as well for us and - with three grandsons for these models to make it through - the durability factor is our primary concern.		This model is part of 2016's 12 piece "Rust-eze Racing" collection - the other models who will also be included are Fred, Donna Pits, Jonathan Wrenchworths, Andy Vaporlock, Michael Sparkber, J. Schoesteer, Japeth, Craig Faster, Mack, and a 2-pack of Rusty & Dusty Rust-eze.
0,product came in perfect condition. i would recommend this for a kid who loves to build things. we were able to stack 12 pegs before it fell over..
0,My granddaughter loves playing with the TV remote so this is perfect and very educational.

0,Bought this for son for Christmas.		Works well on Thomas, Ikea and Imaginarium tracks.  It moves slow and steady and is very quiet.		This train will easily pull 10+ cars, even up small hills.  It has a lot of torque.		Yes, it occasionally drives off the track in corners and you have to test a track a few times first to find any spots where it will always drive off. But these are manageable and overall I'm pretty pleased with it.		Oddly enough...bought the Hiro model at the same time and it has less clearance between the wheels underneath and is horrible compared to Salty.  Same manufacture... I'll be returning the Hiro model and keeping this one.
0,we love this seesaw! especially because the kids can sit on it together or rock on it alone.		setting it up took longer than I thought! definitely a two person job and lots of patience for the small screws!  well, it was worth the labor!!
0,great game

0,A cool toy
0,Of course we all know that some product attract the parent's eyes more than anything. I believe this is one of them. Don't get my wrong it is  very cute, durable, and I'm sure some kids would love it. My 5 year old thought it was fun, but my daughter had it when she was born up to about 17 months old and would put a ball in maybe once every two weeks and that's all she touched it. It definitely wasn't something she gravitated to.	If you child likes the Roll Arounds then it is probably a wonderful toy for them, but personally I think I could have found a number of other products for $30 which would have triggered her interest a little more.
0,The kids love playing with these things.

0,What a fun little Zombie gun. My boys go through the house every night to make sure there are no Zombies. Works great. Like the little saw.
0,Loved the kit. They live doing army play
0,Makes it easier to charge your batteries. Gives you more length to put your lipo batteries in a fire proof bag while charging.
0,Adorable. Thanks
0,There is so much to this duck, that we are still figuring it out, months later. My son is almost two and we use as a bluetooth speaker, bath toy, pool toy, and sometimes use it with the app.  We are figuring out how to use it as a soother and all the other things it can do. I love the way the duck feels and just for the speaker component of the duck is fantastic as my son loves music and bath time is a great time for us to dance and sing. I don't think that too many features is a negative, but I know I can get more from this toy than we currently access.
0,perfect, niece loved it

0,We LOVE these. Great product, worth the money. Out 1 year old has played with them for months.
0,Very nice, daughter loved these!

0,1.5 yr old loves these puzzles!
0,smaller than they look , very tiny
0,Made very well, nice size, stores well!
0,Great price. Cool and colorful. My two year old loves them. Not too big, not too small, just right for his little hands to easily place them on the magnetic board. Magnetism is perfect too. Stay on the board great but are easily removed.
0,On Christmas morning. We bought the duck and the monkey for our kids for stocking stuffers and my husband and I probably played with them the most.
0,Of all the Marvel 2.0 characters, I never expected this to become my son's favorite. It's actually not his favorite character in the comics, but within the mechanics of the game, this is his favorite character to play due to his bad-a$$ moves. He beat me with this guy while I was using Thor, case and point.
0,Didn't buy this box from Amazon but Amazon is the best place to find reviews.  My son really loved this box.  We had good pulls from the Charizard Red/Blue box so he had high hopes.  He pulled out a Vaporeon EX, Ninetales EX and a Blastoise EX from the four packs plus a Charizard holo from the pack that didn't have an ultra rare.  Not to mention the Blastoise EX promo that comes with the set.  My two boys have a had some awesome card pulls from the Red/Blue boxes and the Mythical (Jirachi and Darkrai my young son pulled 2 full art EX's and regular EX from the four total packs) box set Generations packs.
0,My 7 month old son loves his piggy bank.  The coins are primarily used for teething purposes because he has not quite mastered putting the coins in his bank.  I am able to set a coin in the slot, which has a lever that holds the coin up.  My son then proceeds to push the coin down so that it drops into the piggy bank or he grabs the coin and chews on it.  I like that i can just set the coin in the slot and he can decided if he wants to 'spend' or 'save'.  The pig talks when you press it's nose, open/close the door, and counts when you put a coin in the top slot.
0,High quality, awesome!
0,It's a great playhut. However, I find it a bit too pricey for the simplicity of it.
0,Muy buen producto
0,My son loves Rocky, he was very happy with this!
0,Awesome...tough to build, but very cool Lego set!
0,This great storage container is very durable to hold my grandson's wooden puzzles and now he can put them away himself.
0,my 2 1/2 year old loves loves loves this!  The only thing I really wish is that the shapes would some how be attached as well.  For the short amount of time that we have had it, we have already lost the star shape.  So every time we bring it out, my daughter will mention how it is messing.  I am sure it will just be a matter of time before they all are missing.  Which is sad because my daughter really likes drawing with the shapes.
0,Great Horse, My granddaughter loves this guy.  He is fabulous.
0,My daughter (14) is a huge fan of the My Little Pony character/games/movies, but most of the products out there are geared towards younger children. This figurine is a great gift for the older pony lover in the house. It is nice and looks lovely displayed on her shelves in her room. She enjoys it and it would make a great Christmas gift.		The materials seem to be strong, but I would not recommend this as a toy, it is a display only type item for older fans.
0,It's fine but really doesn't have a use.  Basically just a stuffed animal that turns into a ball but what is the point in that.  Been sitting in the toy box unplayed with Christmas.
0,This Naruto figure I bought it just because I'm a huge fan of Naruto. Unfortunately I can't afford to buy Sasuke which is my favorite character. This Naruto I use it a lot and I've own it for like 2 years now and is still durable and useful. I recommend it.
0,Under examination of the internals, it is apparent that this is actually a Rebelle Guardian Crossbow reshell.  The slam-fire function for the Vagabond and Guardian are nowhere near as clean and crisp as the Strongarm's (or the Zombiestrike Flipfury, or the Rebelle Spylight, or the Elite Rampage, etc.).  This is probably because the internal mechanism needs to reset itself before the next shot can be fired off, forcing the user to wait by seizing up that tenth of a second before it can be primed again for another shot.  Both blasters can use the same Elite darts (blue, green, white, orange, and decorated Rebelle darts).  I measured the dart Velocities of all the said blasters on my trusty Prochrono Digital chronograph, and have found the Vagabond to have an average feet per second (FPS) of 63.  I believe it could be better than that if not for the fact that one chamber sounded defective (made an odd popping sound and consistently gave a rating in the high 40s/low 50s FPS range), but a couple other chambers produced better results (71 and 72 FPS, respectively).  Interestingly enough, using the exact same darts my Guardian Crossbow's rating using the same darts just produced similar results (even one 49 FPS shot) but came out with an average at 64 FPS.  Stock, this blaster is stronger than it's brethren, the Doomlands 2169 Lawbringer, but it is not so easy to modify.  The Lawbringer just needs to be opened up and an Orange Mod Works 8kg spring swapped in it.  The Vagabond and Guardian require more work because of their sealed plunger cup design, which is a pain to have to take apart and reassemble (it is not that it cannot be done if you are willing to go the extra mile for a small gain, it's just that it may not be worth it).  The Vagabond has several unnecessary barrel holes at the tip for show, and one oversized one on top (which decreases the chance that the darts will rub up against it and lose kinetic energy; obviously it would make ranges shorter if it were otherwise) this is the only true barrel hole used on the blaster, and the darts do not seem to touch it as they are launched.  Ergonomics: both the handle grip and the pump-action priming handle are hefty and comfortable for people with any-sized hands.  There are two very thick sling points on both ends of the blaster, and one tactical rail in the middle on top (to put maybe an optic sight or perhaps an ammo rack).  I don't think I mentioned it, but anyway this is currently a Target exclusive item that I purchased online from their website.  Buyers beware, do not purchase this with an inflated price tag.  Go to Target or wait for it to come down when released at other stores.
0,These insets came in blue and pink for me, but I asked the seller about that and they said it just depends on what is sent to you for the color you get.  I requested the blue and pink and got it, however, they can't guarantee what color you get. Very pleased with the insets, they work great and are a reasonable price.
0,Innovative, interactive toy that is truly amusing and adorable. I gave one to my just-turned 7 year old granddaughter, and it was hilarious watching her engage in conversation with this alien-looking creature. Adorable; although overpriced like most toys of this kind............
0,Bought these for my son's first birthday and they worked great and I still have an entire box to give out at some point!
0,Happy with these bright colored bags.  Worked well for my craft show.  Nice enough to use as gift bags.
0,is a product of very good quality, brand and price. I recommend it to all people who are in search of something. Besides, it is very nice, I loved it.
0,cant wait till christmas!
0,My daughter loves this and it is a good price for something so well made.
0,Beautiful!
0,This cupcake set is so cute.  Larger than the typical children's bake set.  My granddaughter will probably want to bake all of the time!!
0,One of my Favorite Monster High Guys (Mansters). Love that he has real hair. Only wish he wasn't wearing shorts.
0,Very heavy and sturdy.  The lid is quite heavy but we still love it.  It seems much better than the cheap plastic ones I see most of the time.  He's had it a few years now and it's still a weekly play-with toy.  It is proudly displayed in his bedroom.  Great little chest.
0,Great product! My kids loved this!
0,this is the ONLY repairable drone i've reviewed/owned, i smashed it into a nearby tree, broke two motors and bent two gears, took time to get the inexpensive replacements, and still there's a grinding noise that bothers me, but it works
0,Purchased for Jr. High aged students, they love it.
0,This was a valentines gift. The cutest way to spend and evening with my love. Watching Doctor who reruns and working on our new puzzle together. Good quality puzzle with strong pieces.
0,This blew our friends son away. It is a fairly large toy and is displayed quite well in the box it comes in. It seems a bit pricey for two action figure toys but when you open the box, you'll be impressed with the quality of this set.
0,Cute and fun but my son is not into playing with it.
0,As promised
0,One of the best POP fallout characters out there.
0,Made it a family affair, with my 1st grader and 3rd grader.  We all had a job and it was a blast to do it together.  Worked well and was interesting.  I would have wished they had included one or two extra pieces for each part type, though that's not a huge issue.  I'd recommend this as a great toy.
0,Great bingo game
0,It's been a while now that I wanted to order the magnet blocks but it was way over my  budget , then I came  across this product so I ordered to give it a try .	I got our order today and  we (my 18 months old baby and I ) were very exited to play with it , the bright colors are fun and attractive it's very well made , and the  possibilities are endless , it took us a little to get the hang of it but I must  admit not only my son enjoyed it , I did too	We will Definitely order more.
0,My daughter loves everything paw patrol and this was a great addition to her collection
0,Great gift. Not as big of a drawing window as it appeared online. But, otherwise, ok.
0,You can read the details in the other reviews, but this kit is the perfect accessory kit to the easel, which my daughter received for her birthday.  Granted, I think it is expensive for what you're getting, but it's all toegether and matches.  It certainly does the trick.
0,I bought this for my 3 year old granddaughter, she plays with her play food for hours.  Great for kids, thanks!
0,We received this game to review from Educational Insights. I found this to be a great thinking game for my older boys, ages 6-10, who are starting to outgrow many games for younger ages. This game challenged them to think about the right word that matched the definition. The directions were easy enough for the youngest to understand, but challenging enough to hold the interest of all of us. With a variety of ways to play the game it can easily be adjusted to your kids' vocabulary level. Even my 9 year old son requested the harder side of the playing cards, knowing that while he may get them wrong, it would help him to improve his vocabulary.		My boys were excited to blurt out the answers and it only took a few rounds of rolling the die to get a winner. My boys enjoyed it so much we actually played 3 rounds the first night.
0,love it
0,My grandson loves this!  He's 2 years old and this actually holds his attention for more than 5 minutes.  Amazing!!!  It was easy to assemble and the whole family is happy with it.
0,Took these camping and they survived being dropped off granite rocks.
1,Had to return this drum due to an overwhelming chemical odor. I won't be giving my small child a drum off-gassing stinky chemicals, thanks. Off to look for a more responsibly manufactured product.
1,We have a friend with an adorable Boo doll and my daughter fell in love with it. When we received  this one, it was of much lower quality. The fur was not as soft, the colors were not as rich and the filling was sparse. It is clearly a less desirable stuffed animal and noticeable enough even for a 2 year old
1,This may be good for up to 5 years old.  Other than that, it's flimsy.  Mine also came with rust covered nuts, bolts, etc...not good for a toddler or outdoor product.
1,Stopped working after a few months. Daughter loves it and plays with it everyday. New batteries and nothing...
1,Nowhere in the description did these say that they contain a VERY loud squeaker in each ball.  I bought these as prizes for a party with 12 kids, so you can imagine how quickly the parents went crazy with 12 kids squeaking these over and over!  Also, the string/ring part of the toy broke within seconds of each kid playing with them, so there were tears involved and I can't believe I spent $18 on squeaky balls that aren't even fun to throw and catch because of the spikes.
1,The face durty.
1,The hose threaded fine but the water came out for about 5 minutes before it completely broke. It's so flimsy & cheap. I don't recommend it.
1,as others have said, both of the packs were open and were glued back shut
1,Bought to store Shopkins, nice idea but didn't work out. The zippers are flimsy and when shopkins are in the pockets they stick out, so ours came unzipped just from the pressure. They were not overly full. Would not buy again.
1,Most of them are broken when you open them the fan part isn't glued on or something.
1,I liked the size and height. That worked well. But I was very disappointed that the Lego bricks did not fit. Also the panels were not lined up (the pegs) so you couldn't build across the board. This is the side I really wanted for my grandchild. Was very disappointed.
1,they're ok, they fall off very easily and are all over the house stuck in the carpet
1,I like the picture but I don't like work puzzles with missing pieces.
1,I'm a huge Monopoly fan, and was excited to purchase this edition (which I purchased off the shelf in 2000).  I liked the upgrades to the board and property and tokens, but the money is a DISASTER!  After trying to play it ONE time, we broke out an old edition of Monopoly and took the money to use with the Millennium Edition...game play was impossible otherwise.  If you're looking for a special edition of Monopoly, look elsewhere.
1,Bad product....doesn't look anything like the picture after you try to carve.
1,These came damanged and completly un useable!!!!!!!! i cant use these for party favor boxes. such trash. i shouldnt of spent this money on them!!! DO NOT BUY THESE YOU WILL REGRET IT!
1,This fits really big on a 5 year old. At least we will have it for next renaissance.
1,GOING TO RETURN BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO SMALL AND COULD BE A CHOKING HAZARD!!
1,My three year-old granddaughter got this for Christmas and is already asking for "Real" princess crowns for her birthday.  Even to a 3 year-old it just is not very realistic.
1,Nerf guns are way better than this and this was way more expensive!
1,These cars look nice but broke first time they were played with.
1,The people buying these things are blind they think you get booster box. Please make it more clear. I did not buy, but i cam tell more reviews that people thought you are getting booster box.
1,box not included
1,This is an overhyped pile of crap. All it does is make a few noises and poorly play a few lame games. It won't amuse your child for more than a few minutes and is guaranteed to disappoint.
1,Disappointing as screws  template in the base did not match the horses legs. Never were able to assemble it on the rocker properly. But could not stop my two daughter 2 and 3 years old from using it....and that is the problem because assembly is not right and I am afraid that they hurt themselves while using it
1,my cats loved it, though the batteries last an hour, now to find the stupid batteries, I hope they were just old batteries and not that it will eat through batteries really fast.
1,Really good price on these parts, and I saw why when I assembled the hub to the hub carrier. The fit is way sloppy even compared to old flexable plastic parts! Even with the stock hub carrier bushings in place the hub moves up and down about 1/16 in and on a 1/10 scale truck thats totally unacceptable. The hub carrier is taller on the inside demention. If I cant find washers small enough to shim the spaces up, I will be returning these parts and just getting the stock plastic parts. At least I know they fit properly. I would spring for the genuine Redcat parts on this upgrade if plastic isn't enough. Would have gave it one star but it did come with ball bearings for the hubs.
1,After months of hopeful requests from my 4 year old daughter for this doll, Santa left Mariposa this morning under our Christmas tree. The doll is lovely and sparkly and will capture the imagination of most young girls, but those darn wings are a never-ending frustration. We've had it open less than a few hours and already I've had to hook them back on at least 15-20 times. I'm caught between exchanging it for the other Mariposa with the smaller wings or gluing the wings on with super glue as other posters have suggested. I wish I read the reviews before we asked Santa for this gift -I never imagined the very poor design problem on the wings!
1,As with all the other 2 star reviews, this is not up to standards that are normally associated with Funko Pop. The paint job is horrible and the casting is just as bad. The clear plastic parts on top are both scuffed and if you look at the underside, there is evidence a grinder was used on the edges, though with poor results. I would send it back but I have misplaced the box. It sits at the back of my collection so the flaws are not so apparent. I really have doubts of its authenticity. It is from China We all know how rampant counterfeits are in these areas of the world
1,to small - miniature - wanted larger size
1,Not like they used to make them, that's for sure.  They are lightweight and not solid ..seem smaller too.  But were shipped quickly
1,Product description states made in Israel but box states actual origin is China. Would not buy this product again. Product description has since been revised to not show country of origin. I no longer trust Hohner's origination information.
1,We have about ten Folkmanis puppets, but this one is the worst.  It did not look as good as the photo and I was disappointed.  The Folkmanis black lab is much better.
1,Not the best paint job but sorta OK from a distance. Ended up selling mine at a discount.
1,I use these for kids and they are a MESS. They stain, and badly! They don't come off hands, clothes, or tables very easily. If you apply them with too heavy of a hand, they bleed badly as well. I would recommend trying something more washable--even as bingo markers--just in case of accident!
1,Paint chips off!
1,The clicky-clacks can drive you crazy  The visuals are OK.
1,Love product but 2nd time using already has a leak
1,As soon as i got the tights,they ripped into a hole. Please don't get this an d waste your money, but other than that the costume was great
1,The ink came dried out and after replacing the batteries three times, it still didn't work. The tenth doctor is my daughter's favorite and even with a replacement one it still let her down. Poorly constructed.
1,You can hardly see it on the wall.
1,Didn't work; just shut off.  Returned it.
1,I bought this for my classroom. My Kinders enjoyed viewing and learning about the metamorphosis cycle. Unfortunately, when the butterflies emerged from their cocoons they had all kinds of problems. Some came out with crumbled wings that never straighten out and one died.
1,These Zootopia characters are too small and they can pull apart. The elephant tusk keeps coming off and I'm always finding the foxes tail. I loved the movie, but wasted my money on these for my grandson. He really does' t play with them much.
1,The actual size of this plain is 7-3/4 inch, not 9-inch that was advertised!
1,MR. OWL HAS BEEN TURNED IN EVERY DIRECTION POSSIBLE IN HOPES HE'LL MOVE. NO MOVEMENT AT ALL !  HE IS CUTE BUT DOESN'T DO WHAT IT'S INTENDED TO DO.
1,Too difficult for my toddler to use. You have to push rather hard to get the pegs in the holes of the mat and to get them to fit on top of each other. My toddler is very frustrated because of that. We have another set of pegs that he plays with often. These are just too hard to put together.
1,I bought this for a bday gift for a child and it came in just as I planned, the day before party!  HOWEVER......  The presentation SUCKED!! REALLY Amazon! You should be ashamed of yourself. This should have come in the original fisher price sealed packaging. NOT in a tiny card board box, like it was picked up at a tag sale on the side of the road or was it some return item.  It looks like I had a toy in my house I no longer wanted, and decided to give it away as a gift.  I cannot give this as present. I am discussed and disappointed with amazon not fisher price !
1,I work in schools as a therapist so I use lots of games. This is not one I would recommend. It has been promoted so much on tv that all the kids know it, but it doesn't last long. Literally the yeti can fall after one spaghetti is pulled. So unless the kids want to be strategic many of the impulsive ones will try to make it drop as fast as they can. That's my clinical opinion when using this game with kids. Otherwise it can be a fun game for kiddos who really are interested in trying not to let the yeti fall.
1,The title of the review refers to the quality, not the price.		The 24-inch-long pull string is a strangulation hazard, so if you buy this for your baby, cut it short.		Our chicks don't peep AT ALL. They also slide right out of the chicken's rump as soon as you put them in, unless the chicken's wheels are in EXACTLY the right position (and what baby is going to be able to figure THAT out?).		The chicken is poorly balanced, so she topples over frequently unless she is pulled in a perfectly straight line on a perfectly flat surface by someone other than a baby.		Overall, a waste of twenty bucks. Go with a set of blocks or some Fisher Price stacking cups; these are pretty popular with our kid and they come out of the box working.
1,Waste of money, not one sea monkey after one week.  Complete dud
1,What a waste. If anything, this is a good source for a lesson in ecology. It has an irreplaceable battery that's encased deep inside the egg. When it runs out, you're just supposed to throw the plastic egg and its trapped battery into the trash. What an ecological nightmare of a product. Disgusting.
1,We have a son and took our chances on ordering, but got pink.  Recommend getting this at the store if you need a specific color.
1,No instructions. Not much fun.
1,This claw machine was fun for about 10 minutes.  It was grinding the moment we started playing.  When the claw was moving it was clicking, grinding, and finally cathing in the middle of the machine and no longer going to the right side of the machine at all.  A very disappointing birthday present for my child.  If you are able to purchase a good one, which I doubt, beware of the high pitch, loud, and repetitive music.  When you check out add a pair of ear plugs for everyone in your house.  Disaster In a Box!  It is a very expensive Candy Bowl.		Review by Mother		This toy is fun.  But I am disappointed that it was broken the day I got it for my birthday.  I am not going to get to play it at my party with my friends.  :(  I hope my mom can find me a better one.		Kid Review		We gave it 2 stars because it was fun for a very short while!
1,Would not recommend or buy again. Cheap quality and broke within a week. The magnetic fruit pieces have no way of sticking to the spots they go in and the magnet in the pen isn't very strong . Waste of money
1,I bought this for my granddaughter last week, who is 17 mos old. Like an idiot, I too went by the picture on the box. Lesson learned !!! Follow specs !!! I don't have anything positive to write about this box of plastic. TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED. This same item available on Amazon is also at Dollar General & Family Dollar for $20.00. Open the box and there are lots of cheaply made pieces. Some of the pieces were warped ie: shelves. The plastic is thin and sharp. Took a while to put it together. In my opinion, the only solid piece on this, is the little white door at the bottom. The oven door didn't shut fully and then we noticed the right hinge was broke. The microwave door is hard to open and shut. You have to hold on to a shelf while you pull the door open to keep it from falling forward on you or when you shut it to keep it from falling backwards. The left front knob works great but the one beside it just keeps turning. My granddaughter accidentally bumped up against the kitchen itself and the whole thing fell backwards and the microwave popped completely off. I couldn't help but be mad and crack up, using a few choice words. I left it off.  I'm upset with myself for paying $20 for it and I feel worse for the person who paid $30. My first thought was to donate it to a church or maybe goodwill, but I don't think its safe period. Maybe trashing it. I don't understand how the company can get by selling such a poor quality item as this . Its cute, is all I can give it.
1,We received this as a well-intentioned gift from a loving family member.  It now sits on a shelf until I figure out how to "recycle" it.		Disclaimer:  I've had LeapFrog products in the past and their customer service is awful so I do not like them to begin with.  I'd even go so far as to say their customer service is hostile.  They are very unfriendly and accusatory, so right out of the box when I see "LeapFrog" I'm already pretty on guard.		Yes, as all the other reviews say, it's super complicated to setup and expensive to keep stocked up with media.  So instead of restating all those complaints (which are valid), let me just say this:		Don't buy this.  Read your child a book instead.  Take the time they'd be sitting in front of this screen reading a $10 "book" by themselves with a computerized voice and digitized pictures, and instead cuddle up with your little one(s) and read them an actual book.  Let them hear your human voice inflection, answer their random questions as you read, and let them interrupt the book with their comments that you can talk about together.  Let them turn the pages and look at the printed pictures.  Reading a physical book is a much more natural and loving way to entertain and teach a child.		Our kids are all going to grow up super computer literate in this generation, we don't need to worry about that.  We need to worry about getting them away from extraneous gimmicky screens like this, and into our arms where we can connect with them.		Don't get this.  Its unnecessary.  It's disconnecting between parents and kids.		Read books together instead.  Have your child go to bed with your voice in their head, not this computerized one.
1,i really want to like this product. i take that back, i DO love this product for the first week. After a week, it starts acting funny and is essentially useless. It's sad because this was huge hit at Christmas
1,First of all, we did not get the selection in the picture. There were a few dinosaurs that we received that were the same. They are also not large. They are small. It would be a stretch to call any of these 7" unless you creatively measured them. They are fine toys, but not what was expected. It was a shame that we ordered these for Christmas, or they would have gone back.
1,gARBAGE!
1,Factory defect plugs on the electronics. They warp over time and lose connection and throw a PIC emergency error code and quit working.  Plan on $100 a year for new circuit boards if you buy one.  When it quits you can wedge a piece of cardboard under the sensor wire connection on the mother board but it don't last long before you have to replace it.
1,Broke within 10 minutes of opening the package.
1,Cheap and flimsy. Not even worth the 10 dollars i got it on sale for
1,This was a much smaller size than I was lead to believe and I was expecting more pieces.  I think the product is good just not great.
1,I ordered three of these thinking that they were just colorforms.  I did not realize it was an actual game.  I am going to return these items.
1,Not enough math
1,Not sure why there are so many rave reviews for this product. It is literally the size of an index card and only about 4 pages long (some activity book!) The stickers are bright and colorful but there are only enough to make about 3-4 sticker robots. You could probably find something similar at the dollar store.
1,The battery is functional. It however is not the original one that came with the drone it also looks nothing like the picture. The shipping was fast though and came before it was supposed to. It is very cheap and was made in china
1,We bought this product for it's quality and when we got it we find out it was made in China! We were under the impression that these products were all made in the US and safe for children.
1,Very cute toy and I wish I could love it, but this playhouse is SO flimsy.  If you gently tap the car to go down the ramp, the ramp will fall apart.  All the accessories do not stand on their own.  The boards in the background as wardrobe, falls on constantly.  This playhouse is adorable but just too frustrating to deal with.
1,After two months of excessive mouthing and chewing, the wood bases are splintering and falling apart. Keep an eye on this toy if you have a chewer.
1,My 5 yr old is less than thrilled with this. It's like a puzzle, but there's no wrong way to put them together. She was excited to see the mermaid but after a few rounds of mixing and matching, it was dumped to the side where it's sat and no one has played with it sense. My 15 month old could care less about this. It's well made. We love this brand and we have several of the puzzles, this just was lackluster for us.
1,Let me begin by first stating that I am an RC expert.  For my hobby since 2007 I have invested over 40K in high end RC helicopters and products from: Align, Castle, Futaba, JR/Spektrum, Synergy, Curtis Youngblood, OS, HiTec, Thunder Power just to name a few.  I feel it is important to mention this before my review so that you understand it's nothing ignorant on my part.  As other reviewers have complaints that are from ignorance (which is completely understandable because they are buying this product as a "toy" helicopter with no prior RC knowledge - and a toy is what this pretty much is)  Which brings me to why I bought this and why I'm so pissed off!:	My son is approaching 2 years of age.  I fly little micro fixed and collective pitch helis in the living room and even an E-Flite BNF "Night Vapor" slow flying plane for him to see.  He really loves watching them and even makes fake plane sounds and motions with his hands like he is flying.  So I bought this Chinook for him to watch as Chinooks look like fortresses in the sky.  And this one has lights to marvel at just like the E-Flite Night Vapor does.  Anyway, it's too bad that Parkzone or E-Flite (Horizon Hobby) does not make one of these to bind directly to my 750 dollar 2.4ghz transmitter.  It would be so much safer.  Here's where I begin bashing this cheap piece of garbage and .  First of all safety is always first. If you're into the hobby, you are more than likely an AMA member and safety is always first.  Even inside my house,  there is always a flight line just like at a flying field.  You never fly with any person or animal in front of you or even on the side of you. Always behind you.  And even in the AM and FM synthesis radio days, I have NEVER, I repeat NEVER had any product go haywire on me like this one did.  There was always a fail safe built in, or you bought and put on a fail safe.  Just as others have reported in the other reviews here you will read - I got one that just took off on it's own.  And yes this is after : 1. Putting fresh batteries in the cheap transmitter. 2. Turn on the AM 27mhz transmitter 1st.  2. With freshly charged 7.4V 2 cell LiPo battery installed and plugged in, turn on the helicopter.  Results: both rotors start up full power without the transmitter throttle active!!!	It flew up and  smacked the high vaulted ceiling and slammed to the ground.  It pisses me off because it could have hit my son.  I checked everything out and started the process again, it flew around semi-stable, it's not very accurate and there is no gyro compensation.  (BTW -  I landed after 5min30sec and checked out the battery on my professional equipment: (Hyperion 615i Duo3 w/1000 watt power supply).  The battery was extremely HOT - but no surprise as this is has two brushed motors and cheap brushed motors run hot in comparison with brushless motors.  The voltage reading for each cell was at 3.63 volts after 5 min and 30 sec.  I'm mentioning this because there are reviews here on Amazon that state they can fly 11 minutes.  11 minutes will definitely destroy the battery.  If after 5 min the cells are at 3.63 the 11 min would drop it well below the minimum 3.2Volts per cell.  Generally you don't even want to go near 3.2V or your battery will swell (puff up) and it's then TOAST.  And also a dangerous fire hazard at that point.  There are a lot of people out there who do not understand Lithium Polymer technology.  It's again understandable, especially for those who are older and do things the old Ni-cad way or even Ni-Mh.  Back to this JUNK!  I tried once more thinking that one glitch was some stray signal or something.  NOT!!!  These are so lacking in quality control and no wonder it's only 50 bucks.  They really should be ashamed of themselves for trying ot make a quick buck by selling a mass quantity and meanwhile the poor unsuspecting people are buying these for their themselves, their children or their grandchildren and damaging property, or even getting injured because of this CRAP that they should take off the market because it's defective garbage.  So I tried again the next day and this time without my son around (same place - in the living room)  I flew and landed it on the carpet. It then took off on it's own and did a crashing chicken dance underneath my son's  bouncer toy .  I then picked up and put it back on the carpet and this time it flew on it's own and it was heading towards me near the dining room and headed straight for one of my 1200 dollar Thomasville Rivage dining chairs!  HELL NO - I wasn't about to let that piece of crap damage a 1200 dollar dining chair so I acted quickly and used the cheap AM radio telescopic antenna to swat it down like it was a flying bat on the attack.  It bent the AM antenna  as I swatted that piece of crap down, but I prevented it from doing any damage to my furniture!  Back in the box ! RETURN CRAP TO SENDER !!!  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PIECE OF CRAP.  It is dangerous as they obviously use cheap transmitter and receiver boards manufactured without quality control.  In all of my years of RC I've never had an RC car, truck, boat, plane, or helicopter that went haywire like this.	I firmly believe that when these get sent back as defects, they just repackage and resell them.  (Not Amazon as they do not have control of that - but when the real seller gets their merchandise back from Amazon - I know they repackage this stuff, even the defects - mine came with a used balance charger - which didn't matter to me because I use my professional chargers and remove the battery each time to charge like you're supposed to.)
1,Upon 1st use, noticed a black spot in lens; wiped it but not completely gone. Wish adjustment knob was more stable--seems to move when I move the scope just a little. Doesn't replace the one I had for decades.
1,junk
1,poor quality
1,Not sure if my were defects but they were not pose-able.  returned.
1,AMAZON PRIME IS THE BEST FOR GETTING ANYTHING SHIPPED FAST TO YOU***  THIS TOY IS NOT ACCURATE, IT IS THE WR0NG C0L0R AND THIS TOY LOOKS LIKE P00. IF YOU WANT THE ORIGINAL NICK FURY BUY MARVEL MINI-MATES FROM YEARS AGO WHEN NICK FURY WAS ST1LL WH1TE. THE NEW NIGK FURY IS NOT GOOD AT ALL. DON'T SCARE YOUR KIDS BY BUYING THIS NASTY TOY. THE REST OF THE LEGO MARVEL FIGURES ARE FUN. JUST NOT THIS ONE. {DON'T FORGET, FREEDOM OF SPEECH, AND ALL}
1,Didn't get to see them they were given to someone else to use.
1,We have now bought 2 of these, & both have broken. Our daughter isn't rough on toys. In fact, she never has broken toys. Buy the doors broke off of both minivans & can't be fixed. I refuse to buy another. We love Fisher Price because of the quality of their toys, so this was a definitely disappointment.
1,BEWARE!!!! This a not a doll but a miniature figurine maybe 2 inches spent $15 and got it as a present was embarrassed because it looked like I spent $5 thankfully I had another present in addition to this
1,We ordered the scale since it looked like a natural Waldorf toy, but the space is too small to hold any "real" vegetables. The pointer in the scale is also not accurate and shows sudden irrational movement or sometimes none at all. Does not show any difference for small change in weights. Had to return it and we made one at home with old lunch boxes,strings and hanger.
1,I got this hunk of junk to work....sort of.  This machine does not come close to the Hot Wheels Car Maker.  The Hot Wheels machine is an engineering feat.  This character maker should have spent another year in development.  There is so much potential, but it falls short in so many ways.  First, the machine is supposed to have a green light when the unit is ready to inject.  My unit has no such green light or it is broken.  I've found that when the red light goes off, it's time to inject.  Next, when I inject the wax into the mold, I need to keep pumping the handle with each successive injection.  Sometimes, I need to pump twice per injection.  That pumping action makes sense, but the instructions did not specify that action, so I didn't do it initially.  Also, I push down on the new wax stick while I pump simultaneously.  Pushing down on the wax stick makes the wax inject with more force and seems to put wax into the mold more quickly.  Another key is working fast.  Really fast.  Pump, turn, pump turn.  You need to get that wax pumped out quickly before it has time to dry around the mold. I completed my third attempt and have yet to make a perfect molded character.  There have been gaps in wax coverage.  But with each attempt, they are looking better.  I think it is impossible to expect that an 8 year old kid is capable of operating this machine.  If you want the characters to come out half-way decent, then the parent needs to be involved.  I considered giving it two stars, but I think the
1,After charging and the battery is pulled out, the light stay on. Charging is always incomplete.		*I bought a new one which  worked*
1,My husband and I are professional artists and let our kid make big creative messes on a daily basis and we still found Moon Dough to be way too messy! We have an art studio in our home and I still don't want this crap anywhere in my already messy studio. This is coming from someone who loves to play with other kinds of dough with my daughter, lets her paint with real paint, and lets her shake fine glitter onto her creations with abandon. Imagine giving your kid two NONresealable bags of toxic powder and some cookie cutters! Even when I managed to make something out of it, it crumbled immediately. Absurd. Even more absurd is that the makers seem to know the product will get thrown out after 1 use because there are no containers to store the stuff in once you tear the plastic wrappers off. Dangerously, the sets I bought (on clearance, no wonder!) are to make fake food! I know my daughter wouldn't eat pretend ice cream, but the mysterious nature of the ingredients of the product paired with imaginary food play seems like a bad combo to me.		My husband suspects it's made of something similar to the stuff in a fire extinguisher or an air bag of a car, mixed with some very soft plastic. If you know anything about plastics, the softer a plastic is, the more BPA it has in it and the more leaching takes place. I, like many parents here, am totally suspicious of a product that does not list the ingredients anywhere on the packaging or the website, and will not even give you the ingredients if you contact them directly. What are they hiding?		It brags that it doesn't dry out---that's because it's already dry! I can't say anything new that people haven't already stated, but just don't waste your money or your sanity.
1,Very basic not much of a game. Directions said there should be two colors so you can use one for beginners and move up to the next color but there was only one color in the box.
1,I had high hopes when I bought this because my twins were just getting into toys that made sounds and they were really actively playing with similar toys.  Unfortunately, they could care less about this one and it just sits on the floor.		The upside is that I would go crazy if they did like it because the sounds are very annoying.  The best way to descrive the sounds would be to imagine a slot machine at a casino...fine when you are in Vegas but not the nursery.  Also, this thing eats batteries fast.		Every child is different and you may find this to be a great toy, but I do not recommend it based on my experience.
1,I expect that I'm going to have to put some stickers on, but dude. There were hundreds of tiny stickers that I needed to attach. It was a ton of work.
1,THIS TOY CAME IN WITH A BROKEN ANTENA  FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL UNITE?
1,ok
1,It's cute, I just thought it was bigger :/
1,Disappointed with this product.  The pieces are so tiny and hard to put together.  We got 2 of these kits for my son's 6th birthday and it took both of us to assemble them.  I'm afraid of taking them apart for fear of loosing anything so small.  I won't buy anything like this again.
1,We love green toys, but the handles on the jump rope keep falling off.
1,This product was broken when I received it. I have not had time to write my review. I am very disappointed.
1,They're so small that it took me by surprise. I was really hoping for a 3.5" mom-duck with a couple of 2" to 1.5" duckies following her. Not really.
1,For those who don't know this comes with a flimsy mat and a few cards, and the reason I write such a bad review is that with the money spent on this box a person could buy the gold rares and the mat for less than the complete cost, but the main reason I bought this is for the box, nothing more.
1,Disapointed in game
1,My friend has a phonics set that sticks to her fridge, and I thought this was the same thing. It's nowhere near as nice. They came out with this version about 2 years ago and it honestly pails in comparison to the older version. The cool thing about the fridge version is that the letters stick with a magnet to the fridge so that you don't loose them. This one gets everywhere. Good luck finding and keeping all the pieces.
1,The stars on the top of this are not very bright at all and do not show on the ceiling. If you have it right next to a wall you can see some blurry dots. The actual lantern part is okay and gives off good light for camping ect. Also, the top dome is very flimsy and got dented in and torn up in the first 5 minutes. My son didn't even poke at it, he just dropped it from about waist high. If you want a camping lantern it isn't bad, but if you want something to project stars get a different product.
1,My son loves Grossery Gang but this was a waste of money, I should have known better.
1,I purchased these for stocking stuffers for Christmas for my three kids.  They love glowsticks and I thought this would be a great option to buy them in bulk.  I was not happy with the price, especially when they arrived and I saw how small these were.  I wouldn't purchase these again.  The positive was they did glow for longer than expected and the colors were bright when they lit up.
1,Not at all as advertised!! The title has 9 pcs but everything else including the description and other customer reviews say 12 pcs. These look like cheap knock offs of the original. This seller is not honest about that actual product, does not picture the actual product or disclose the poor condition of the pandas themselves. I needed all twelve of the better looking pandas that are pictured here, that is not at all what I received. I received 9 poorly painted pandas and only got one of each of the Mom, the climbing panda and the panda eating bamboo. The panda eating bamboo is truly pathetic compared to the one in the photo.
1,Mine arrived broken and had to be returned.  This is a very cheaply made product that definitely would not withstand use from most toddlers for long.  I expect more from Melissa & Doug items.
1,The toy didn't work out of the box.  I could tell it's the connection the battery connection; the fan would work when I was jiggling the battery, but not closed.  Cheaply made product that did not work out of the box.  I didn't have a chance to find an Amazon shipping box, repackage and file the return with Amazon in a timely manner.
1,Other reviews said these would go down the stairs.
1,The ink is garbage and the stamps are too large for small children hands.
1,POS!  Everyone know what that stands for?  That's what this is.  I'm irate.  Waste of time and frustrating as !@#$#@!
1,Garbage quality. Cheap thin plastic binder material. Get the Pro binder with the faux leather.
1,The shoulder seam of this dress separated the first time my daughter tried it on. When she wore it for trick-or-treating, the bottom sutache separated from the tulle-like material of the outer skirt while she was walking, and I had to trim it off to keep it from tearing further. This was after only two times of even having it on.
1,These would have been perfect to hang up at my son's 3rd birthday party and I did hang two of them with fishing line. One of them had a small hole from the get go. So really I only had two usable airplanes. The others didn't last long either. He played with them for a couple of days and they started to deflate.
1,Luckily (for me) my mom bought this expensive toy for my son.  He got it when he was around 12 months old and didn't really play with it much for the first six months.  He initially was afraid of the sounds it made!  He mainly tore off the arc with the "P" on it to use for teething.  Later on he snapped the little barrier arm to the elevator in two-which created a potential choking hazard in the small round piece created when it broke.  He does love the magnetic cars, though.  He enjoys the sounds the garage makes now that he's 21 months old, but still doesn't really get the concept of running the cars through the car wash or sending them for a ride in the elevator. I'd say this is a toy for a three year old and up.  Overall, I'm glad he's gotten some enjoyment from this toy but I'm glad I wasn't the purchaser.
1,This part should cost $15. No more than that because its poorly designed. Instead  of replacing broken axle stubs every few battery packs. You will instead be buying tiny little grub screws and pins that u need to dremel a tiny little notch. If you order the hardware from MIPONLINE. You'll spend just as much money on grub screws as you would have spent on axle stubs.		It's only better because they used steel instead of plastic like the standard traxxas shafts. But the engineering is bad.
1,I have always been happy with Leap Frog products and the name alone would sell me on them. I will be more careful buying stuff now.		This is the worst game I have ever used. My 5 year old daughter can't manipulate the writing screen with the pen. It jumps all over the place and disappears. The graphics are horrible, sound is horrible. It came with a Dora cartridge that has basically different versions of 2 games...no variety and they have a time limit to play and it moves and she can't work the joystick and button at the same time. Since the letters continually move it is just frustrating for her and she can't get past one game whether she knows the answers or not. There is no learning curve at all for a beginning learner. Basically 3 strikes and your out and you have a limited time to get those 3 strikes. It doesn't teach anything.		Taking it back tomorrow.
1,Inside mildews and molds quickly
1,I agree with the other reviews, the quality is poor and we found it to be potentially unsafe.		I had slight trouble with the assembly in getting the crank back piece on. The grater quality was poor and overall the product just felt cheesy. We found it to be unsafe for two reasons. One, goes without saying, the grater. While it is for 6+ it still requires supervision, and it seemed like a 2 person job - one to crank the other to hold it steady and scoop shavings.  Second, we found was that the yellow sun which is pushed down to force the ice into the ice shaver (grater) was defective/unsafe. If pushed down too far it shaves off along with the ice, it has no stopping point, so we ended up with tiny yellow shavings in our 'snow.'  We ended up throwing out that batch and haven't used it again.		Can't recommend, sorry.
1,Looks like the picture however right away I noticed the back pack piece just sort of falls off. Of course my child doesn't want to part from it now that he has it but it did not seem like it was worth the amount I paid unless somehow it was damaged in shipping. I doubt that due to the fact the box was in great condition... A little disappointed.
1,The tattoos don't transfer well to the skin, even after extra time.
1,They are tiny!!  More triceratops or stegosaurus than brontosaurus and t-rex.  The little horns are very sharp too.  I am going to have to put 3 dinos in egg to make it worth a prize.
1,Although these loom bands are very cool looking they are not very stretchy. My 9 year old will not use them. She says they are too hard.
1,1 extra blue marble in package and it 1 short a green marble.
1,CRAPOLA....don't waist your money on these, you see them break the minute you hand them to your kids.
1,Paper is very thin and paint bleeds through immediately.
1,Because the plastic on top has slits in in my daughter's toes sometimes get stuck in there and she has a hard time keeping them on.  We ended up getting her a different pair. (She's 2)
1,Cute pillow but VERY small!
1,This is a cute set, but it has some issues - or maybe we didn't buy it at the right age. We bought it for our son's first birthday and it's been in a box in a closet ever since. We've pulled it out a couple of times, but each time, we found a reason to put it away again. He's 21 months old now.		Parents should be aware of the following:	1) Some of the pieces are quite small (small enough to be a choking hazard). I pulled these ones out of the set right away and put them away.	2) The pull-cord is longer than I expected, so I cut it off. Maybe I'm too uptight about safety issues, but it was long enough for a toddler to wrap around his/her neck and it was only a matter of time before mine tried it.	3) The cars have wooden poles on them, where you stack the various blocks. These little poles are exactly the width of toddler eyes and we had a near-miss by a new walker, which caused the set to be put away for the first time.	4) Roller skate potential. I don't know how he does it with the poles on the cars, but this is the most recent reason the train set went back into the closet.		All in all, this set has been more trouble than it's worth for us, though I admit that we may have bought it for too young of a child. Our son loves blocks and trains of all kinds, but he has never been very interested in this set during its brief appearances in his toy collection.
1,Let me start by saying that I have had nothing but good experiences with AMAZON - until now.		Personally, I find these "babies" a little creepy.		Okay; that aside, AMAZON shipped us the wrong one! In order to fulfill a birthday wish for my 9 year old grand-niece, we ordered First Day - a Real Boy. Her birthday is tomorrow and late this afternoon we received First YAWN instead. The dolls are similar, but the expressions are completely dis-similar. AMAZON, this isn't what we ordered!		That's not the worst of it. We removed the doll from the factory packaging to find out that one of the doll's "toes" had been cut off. I have to assume this was the action of a disgruntled employee (or a return from a troubled individual). Definitely one of the stranger sights I've encountered of late.		I'm not even going to bother to return this for fear that it might get sent to another AMAZON customer. I will take some small pleasure in throwing this thing in the garbage where it belongs.		By the way, this doll is MUCH smaller that one would think from the pictures. Caveat emptor, folks.
1,While putting it together, it almost broke.  It's not good quality and a waste of money. I can pay $5 at the dollar store and get a toy of the same quality.  I'm pretty sure the fighter jet I got for my son's birthday will be the same.  I got this one for my 2 yr old, and that is why I put it together today.  Will not be buying from this company again.
1,Ehhhhhhh....it's ok.  Pretty small and as you can expect (since it's made of a flimsy cardboard).  Ok for a party decoration but definitely wouldn't hold up as a toy.
1,Hardly makes bubbles....
1,Tricky for my five year old to use independently.  Not really that exciting.  He has never played with it after first opening it.
1,So small... Not something I would recommend for a baby.
1,should be rated as under l yr old.  as soon as babies can sit up would be fine. my grandson 18 mos. was bored within an hour.
1,I was under the assumption that we would be getting more then one puzzle for the price ( Since there are 3 in the picture) I received only the green small letters which was upsetting because had we had the choice to pick we would have loved the numbers. The letters are very small and tear easily.
1,batteries are hard to find  it works good but is hard to use. other than that it is ok. enjoy
1,This set is cute and fun for my beginner engineer. The trains are well made. And I got the set for a decent pre-Christmas price, and getting a battery powered Thomas with it makes it a pretty good buy for a starter set. I don't even mind that the battery powered Thomas typically eats an AA battery every day or two. Here comes the big BUT other reviewers have mentioned. For the amount of money you pay for Thomas items, these tracks do not hold together well. And the battery powered Thomas is constantly tipping over on the curves, or if it's pulling other trains they tip over on the hill. My son loves this set but gets very frustrated when his trains keep going off track. I won't be returning it because he has loved playing with it daily since he got it. But really, I'm going to try another brand of track for expansion. Most of the off-brand tracks aren't made with traction to supposedly improve the performance of the battery powered trains, but I'm willing to give them a shot, as you get a lot more track for the money, and the performance of these is not impressive. I also just ordered the track locking clips sold on amazon, which I hope will help. I knew I'd have to spend more to expand our Thomas collection, but I didn't count on having to spend more just to get good performance from this set.
1,Very hard to open cabinets/drawers. I have to use plyers when my 3 year old constantly asks for another one to be opened.
1,My daughter  enjoyed it for 20 minutes and is over it. Nothing special. Just a bucket car.
1,Don't waste your money
1,The neck is huge and awkward
1,These vegetables are made of off-gassing, smelly plastic!  I'd chosen these because no one (at the time) reported a smell in their reviews.  Almost all other food sets have reports of stink.  I opened the plastic wrapper and out came the gasses!  My 18-month old puts everything, especially toy food in her mouth and these don't seem to be safe for that.  I wish the company was more open about the composition of their products.  As for the scale and appearance of the toys--that is great. So I went with 2 instead of 1 stars.  I'm going to see how much it costs to return these and stick with Green Toys' limited amount of food toys.
1,This device was more headache then it's worth. I was originally going to combine it with my night vision goggles, but I realized that the sound kept getting interference and causing that VERY high pitched loud screeching noise that makes me want to throw it away. Instead, I gave it back to Amazon. Maybe some kid might like being deaf. I also didn't like the handle bar either. It felt very awkward and I wish there was  an automatic shut off device after a certain volume. I heard people talking about that feature, but I apparently never reached that limit... Anyways, the two stars is because it did allow me to hear from a far distance, even though the sound quality was horrible... I mean... I could probably find a cheap digital audio recorder and just amply the sound later and it'll probably give me the same effect.
1,Arrived damaged in an envelope. Sending back
1,This playdough is sticky and leaves a residue everywhere. Stuck in all the playdough toys and too mushy. Just stick to regular playdough
1,I immediately bought this based on the theme. If I didn't know any better, I'd have donated to its kickstarter if I knew it existed when it did.	I own an extremely large shelf of board games, card games, and video games. This is one of the most boring games I have ever played. I literally keep crappy stuff for collector's value. This? I honestly wouldn't care if it were lost or destroyed.	In fact... if I accidentally dropped this game into the trashcan, I wouldn't even waste the effort to take it out.		Unfortunately, the fun of this card game ends at the front of the box. Upon opening them, the artwork (although well drawn when intended to be specific things) it is too much of a mix of different consoles.		Heroes look like SNES Final Fantasy characters, while actions look like NES graphics. I don't know, but I was hoping for either purely NES-like artwork or more variety. All of the heroes look almost identical to each other. I wouldn't notice if there was only 1 artwork for each hero type, because very few are unique enough to look good. They all look like they are from the same game too, not a variety of different games and systems. What is the point of being inconsistent with the console (8 bit, 16 bit, Nes, Snes, etc.) when the artwork is actually consistently bland? I complain because honestly, it's not coherent. With a few exceptions (like the NES Megaman guy on the cover) almost all characters are SNES, in a NES world. It's like a 3rd generation console environment, with 4th generation console characters. Just odd IMO.		Even more unfortunate is the fact that the artwork isn't my real complaint. Not even close. Compared to the fun the game provides, the artwork is spectacular. Even if it gets disappointing when you look at it more than the first time, at least the first time is "Oh man, that's awesome! LOL!" or "Hey, it's megaman! That's Metroid! LOL!"		I played the game with my two brothers, and I must say that I wanted to blow my brains out. Not only did it take much longer to play than it said it would... none of us had any fun. We actually quit the game early, which is an extreme rarity in our world. Normally when we have to move rooms, we'd simply take the game with us or stack it in an organized fashion so we can put it back exactly as it was and continue playing elsewhere. By this, I mean we tend to do silly amounts of work and are huge nerds. This game didn't get the nerd treatment. It got the "Oh dear god, this is a horribly designed game."		The game is actually simple. Extremely simple. You are almost guaranteed to win, and spells are a rarity. The entire game is simply about playing a few spell cards from first turn to last (not some every turn, but more like some every now and then...maybe!) Then heroes go through your dungeon and either instantly die, or "hurt" you. You are almost guaranteed to not lose, unless you get extremely unlucky in both hero draw and card draw.		It's so simple, perhaps I didn't realize this is for little kids? But it's not, because little kids wouldn't understand the card text and strategies you are suppose to create. Besides, how is this game NOT created for adults? When we were kids, we PLAYED the NES and SNES systems. I assumed this is for us, not kids who have no idea what a Nintendo is. This is where the game gets ruined.		Regardless of your dungeon's special cards, this is what your dungeon will be like:		1) You can beat any hero, and will always win. So your strategy is to simply get every hero you can in your dungeon.	2) You can beat newbie heroes, but not tougher ones. So your strategy is to simply get every hero you can, without getting too many tougher ones.	3) You can't beat any heroes. So your strategy is to simply avoid attracting heroes until you can get a better dungeon.		The end. Doesn't really matter if you have these special rooms or what not. They may be the deciding factor in a game where you and another are *1* point away from victory. Spell cards are the same way. They wont' do much unless you are cutting it close.		You rarely do anything other than slowly, in an incredibly slow pace, build your dungeon, with rooms you are not impressed with. You rarely draw spell cards, and if you do the spells are equally unimpressive or unimportant.		The card text and abilities are not fun, not entertaining, and not funny.		Each Boss' special ability is next to worthless. Upon finishing your dungeon, you immediately use their ability a single time. Most of the time it will be wasted, because you don't get to save it to use later. It uses it immediately according to the rulebook.		What else can I say? This game is horrible. As a nerd, I'd rather play hardcore football or run a marathon than to ever open this again.
1,It fell apart before we even had chance to learn how it was put together ... no instructions.
1,This car was definitely not a winner. Even weighted it paled in comparison to the other cars at my son's pinewood derby. Ran a 2.936 average, which is pretty slow for a derby car. Two stars just because my son thought it looked cool. Otherwise a lose for me personally.
1,Not ideal. My kid (age 4) keeps misplacing the plastic chain pieces. They're easy to misplace, and there no spare parts with the vehicle. He also can't put those pieces on the truck himself, so constantly has to ask me to do it. Yuck! I showed him a number of times, but he doesn't want to fuss, so he tows the vehicle using the roll-bar. Not worth the price. Better off getting the garbage truck.
1,was falling apart when i opened box. cldnt even use for the party. really disappointed.
1,my 6 year old loves monster high and she loved making the doll but the hair was tangled after about an hour to a point you could not do anything with it the ears were very hard to put in and say in
1,Love the style, but extremely cheap. Broke in the first week. Very thin plastic, will not hold up well to toddler play.
1,Poor Quality...they burst after a couple of punches.  I was not satisfied with this product.
1,Not only did this toy not work, but I had a horrible time trying to get a new one.  Nobody carries it any more.  They must have realized it was defective and stopped making them.
1,my daughter loves this toy but this toy is over priced and could be found in walmart or even dollar stores. i bought this ball for her and it worked for like an hour and then stopped working. like i said the toy she loved but is over priced and weak.
1,It looks cool, but most of the features are locked and can only be unlocked with pointless and boring activities you need your cell phone for.  Also, the required app for your cell is ridiculously huge.  Finally, we bought 2 and decided to return the unopened unit but received a terse response that the unit is not returnable because it contains dangerous chemicals and gases.  WHAT?  They can ship it to me just fine, but it's too dangerous to mail back?  And just exactly what dangerous chemicals are they referring to in this child's toy?  All around, this was a scam and a waste of money.
1,The motor just isn't quite powerful enough. Also hard to balance fore-aft, and if you add even a smidgeon of nose weight that extra weight will make it seem even more underpowered. It's a cool idea, and the paper airplane folding technique is probably the best flying paper airplane I've ever seen. But I could barely ever get even one good flight out of this. And I've made a lot of RC and rubber band and paper and flying plane models. I would say save your money and get some kind of cheap RC helo or something. They are positively amazing and make this look pretty quaint and frankly a bit lame.
1,So small you can't even tell they are diamonds. Deceiving.
1,Lovely to look at, makes everyone smile, but the clicking noise makes you crazy
1,Sip ties were cut and it was beat up. I got this two days before a Christmas party and now I have nothing. How did it come open and beat up when I bought it for $25 brand-new???
1,I do NOT recommend this drone. The batteries don't have a high enough c rating and it starves for power. Sometimes it takes a dive to the floor before it can recover. It has fits while it flies. Obviously this causes a lot of crashes. The don't c rate the battery and that must be why they don't. I can't find anything aftermarket that will fit either. The battery also gets really hot and it's not just the one that came with it. I bought a 5 set and they ALL do it.		That makes this a loser, sorry.
1,These darts are NOT soft tips they are hard plastic. They do have the hole on the side to look like they are soft but they are not. I am not allowed to use these in HvZ games because of how hard they are. Best shot is to just buy the name brand ones. They might be extra cash but they are guaranteed to be soft rubber tips, not this plastic crap. I had to return the items and Amazon also has begun an investigation within this seller because they have false advertisement.
1,Very low quality cells being used in these. Charge rate of less than 1c is atrocious, especially since it only lasts a few hours anyway. Go pick up an 1800mah 2s lipo for half the cost. Fatshark goggles have a built in low voltage beeper anyway so you will know when it is drained - no need for the indicator.
1,Other than being a cute stuffed animal there is not much I can say about this thing other than a total waste of money.  seriously the stethoscope does not make sound in the ears just at the bottom where you put against the horses chest.  The hoof pick works on one hoof.  and the needle it almost impossible to find the "Spot" to work.  And brushing its hair it makes noise from time to time.  I am surprised that this has the Breyer name attacked to it.  It was for my grand daughters birthday so there was no way to convince a  year old to send back her plushy horse for something else.  But I'm sure it will be tossed in a corner and not played with long because she has a Dr set that works great that she plays with all the time this she put down and played with a play dough set all night.,  If you find this some place like big lots for 10 bucks it might be worth it but for the price I feel ripped off.  And if you do get this and ignore my warning.  At least open the box before the person you are giving it to get it and take all the stuff apart took me 30 minuted to untie all the junk in the box with a toddler glaring at me waiting.  This needs a micro Philips screw driver to open the battery box so make sure you have one.  Or you are not getting in I just lucked out that we had one Im sure most people don't have one that small.
1,I was excited to get this for my 4-year-old son.  He loves Blues Clues, and he love drawing and art.  This game is VERY boring.  You can put stamps of the Blue's Room Characters in a picture of a room, you can paint pictures of Blues Room Characters, You can Guess what Doodle is drawing . . . none of which is very exciting or engaging.  The graphics are pretty bad also.  Not very crisp or clear.  I would pass this one buy and try something else.
1,I'm not sure if we received a faulty puzzle or what, but the bar that goes into the large cat to hold it together did not fit, it was too long so the cat can't sit flat and that is not even screwed in all the way, we can't get it to screw down into the cat enough to put the last piece on top of the cat's head.  This would have been a lot better if it had actually worked correctly, but I still don't feel it was worth $15.
1,We like these, but the trailors come unattached too easily... Won't be purchasing more from this seller.
1,This is a fun, silly toy, even if your kids aren't in to the whole Miles thing, but it's cheap, verging on junk. The color chips off easily, and the wings fall off it you look at it wrong.
1,I don't know how these kids are doing any of those tricks in the videos, pics, etc... Kids tried it out the first day and never picked this up again.
1,Poor quality and the remote did not work after few minutes, had returned for refund.
1,They sold it to me when there wasn't one is stock so they had to substitute. I was not happy. This was purchased for a 60th b-day party for a man who has driven a wrecker for years. Therefore the replacement balloons they sent with multiple characters on them did not suit our purposes. Very disappointed!
1,cheaply made
1,Cute you but it ends there with cute. It is unbelievably frustrating to play with because all it does is fall apart. And then your child wants you to keep fixing it 100 times. It is so frustrating for him. Don't waste your money.
1,These toys are not designed to be used. They break easily.
1,We received this as a reward through a diapers program, and it was great to get it for "free".  However, I don't think I would pay more than $10.00 for this if I were purchasing it myself.  As another reviewer mentioned, it isn't a very useful or functional tool box.  In fact, the only thing that my 2 year old likes about it anymore is the hammer and screwdriver, and she doesn't even use them with the nails and screws that came with the kit.  The good things about the toy are its construction (solid wood) and its bright colors.  Also, one of the nuts wouldn't thread onto the bolt, so we had to throw the bolt away.  Once again, not a big deal, but only because it was "free".
1,The Pete the Cat pen does not work correctly 99% of the time. Even when you click on the right answer the eyes light up red. It's very frustrating and has discouraged my child. Maybe once in a while it will work. We have taking out the batteries and put it back in and also put in new batteries and still it does not work correctly.
1,The idea of putting a balloon inside of a plastic pig and having the children inflate it per what they roll on the dice is a good one. Adding the hamburgers is a great way to make it seem like the pig is eating too much.		The issue: We bought this toy tonight from Walmart. The first 3 times my son played with it, it worked exactly as advertised. He would put a hamburger in its mouth and use two hands to press the button as the dice said. After a random number of hamburgers, the belt would snap open to end the game.		But after that third time, now the belt comes undone on it's own for no reason. We deflated the balloon per the instructions (turning the tail) and none of the pieces are broken but for some reason the belt just won't stick. I even tried inflating the balloon a tiny bit to see if it would help hold the belt together but that failed me. I get the belt fastened but the minute I put the pig down on the table, the belt bursts open while the balloon is deflated.		Now my son has a game that no longer works. He's only 4 so he's having fun feeding the pig his hamburgers anyways, but I paid over $20 for this toy 2 hours ago and it's already "broken". I can't figure out why the belt refuses to stay fastened.		Based on this alone, I would not recommend this toy to anyone. My kid can learn to count a lot cheaper and in other fun ways besides this. It's too bad because he was really looking forward to getting this toy for the last month.
1,Tiny item. Would have returned if it was worth th bother
1,Very disappointed. Just gave this dolly to my granddaughter for Christmas. She was trying to take the boots off to change outfits and the leg detached. There is not way for us to reattach the leg. I ordered this in Oct and now I can't return or replace for her. Not very happy customer right now.
1,This does not stick.  I am completely bummed that I wasted money on this.  I was postive this was going to be a great surprise for my eight year old, but it doesn't work.  The "paint" does not stick.
1,the supports are flimsy;  my 24 month old destroyed this and had broken the supports within 24 hours of setting it up;  once they break the tent is useless;  they also broke and left sharp edges
1,Remember when they used to put toys in Cracker Jacks? That is what I am reminded of when I look at this. First, I was supposed to be getting the Tree Frog Warrior figure. Instead, I received the Strawberry Bullfrog Poison Ranger Figure, so that is the one I am reviewing. Keep in mind that many of us got the wrong figure, so ordering this could be hit and miss. Though, I'm not sure why anyone would willingly pay $9.99 for one of these teeny tiny things. I know I sure wouldn't. I can think of many things I'd rather spend $9.99 on.		This was a bummer all the way around. I got the wrong figure, it is tiny, and the price is much higher than it's worth.
1,I let my almost two-year old paint with this with direct supervision, even though it says it is rated for age three years and up. I expect a toddler to be messy. That is not what I mean when I say the product is messy. What I mean is that the paint is applied on little pads at the top of each sheet. They are somewhat like a Mary Kay make-up sample that you see at a party. They are difficult to work with, even for me. You effectively have to scrub with your wet paint brush to pick up enough color to be able to paint a few strokes, then return to the pad, scrub to pick up more paint, and apply it again. It will take a toll on the paper if they child has to do this a few times in the same spot. The paper is not made to take much water, which is strange considering that the paint is water-activated.		There is not much paint to use on each page, but perhaps that is a good thing because this WILL stain your child's clothes and ruin them. My daughter got two little dabs of this on her Baby Gap jeans. I took them off and applied Zout immediately. (It has gotten out any number of stains for me, including blood that went everywhere--crib sheet, crib sheet protector, little one's shirt and bottoms, and both crib rail covers when she split her lip on her crib rail while jumping like a fiend.) Guess what? The stain is set. I would never buy this for any toddler or child, unless your child is going to be covered in a full-body smock that you don't care about having stains on, or your child is a perfectly neat little person who never has any accidental spills or mistakes. I'm also concerned about what this would do to carpet and other textiles. Ugh. I cannot recommend it at all, and I regret spending money on it. I will never buy another one of these again. I am off to find the water-activated Crayola painting pages and investigate to see if there is another option from some other company that I am missing.
1,Never got them. I was really excited too.
1,VERY small.  I purchased for my first graders classroom, and they were way too little on his face.  Design/stripes also appeared worn off some. I returned them.
1,My grandson, 2 1/2 years old, grew frustrated that the digger didn't dig and the bucket doesn't dump. Most new toys we have purchased also have an anti-tipping foot in the back which only drives the frustration higher when he gets stuck going backwards. The product safety lawyers are probably happy with this toy, my grandson is not.
1,I first wrote a review slamming this product BUT I found a trouble shooting solution to the screen not working	and it worked.	Now this should not have happened in the first place and I do not think this product is worth the price you pay for it or all of the games but at least there is a way to reset the screen.		[...]	my First review:	I should have listened to the other reviewers who said the screen stopped working.  My son did not use this very often.  I bought about 8 games (you do the math for that investment) the case and extra batteries.  WHAT A WASTE.  The screen stopped working-it wasn't abused, mishandled or even used very much.	We are now looking at getting a hand held devise where we can download games with better graphics for less many and he can watch movies on long trips.  For the price of the system, games and batteries, you should invest in something more reliable.
1,Unfortunitly the product that came was different that is showing on the description and I had to return.
1,I think I really would have enjoyed putting together this set, but it arrived missing a very necessary piece.  Perhaps I'll order it again and try again, but not for a while.
1,I could only get one suction cup to function properly. I used it in a new bathroom (Arizona cookiecutter home) with tile walls. The material is good quality, the idea is cool, but it would fall off within a few minutes to a few hours of hanging it. I followed the instructions to the letter and tried repositioning it multiple times. It's possible that the suction cups could have been defected (?) but I chose to pick up a turtle toy holder that uses a traditional stick (3M) holder. I returned this item for a refund.		I must also add that I have purchased other Skip Hop products that I found to be fantastic. I just can't endorse this one.
1,Cheaply made. Broke within first few hours after it was made.
1,They look as if they are in relief, but they are just flat. I would recommend these if you are looking for shield replicas.
1,I bought this for my 3yo who loves puzzles. Sadly this is one of the worst set of puzzles we own. The pieces don't connect very well together. As you can see from the pictures, the lines don't even align when connected. Some pieces don't even connect properly and that section ends up being not flat. It's very frustrating for a 3yo to try to force the pieces together when clearly they look like they match but somehow they don't connect. It takes the fun out of fixing the puzzle. He only fixed it once and didn't bother with it anymore, when normally he would do it over and over again. We have another Melissa and Doug underwater floor puzzle and that is so much better. I would not recommend this product and I'm considering returning it.
1,My child loved it. Basically she just wanted the wolf. Then she threw it aside and peices are all over her room. Cheap plastic toy with stickers and a big price tag.
1,VERY poor bottle and wand design.  Small opening and short wand means you have to get needle nose pliers to get the wand out or dump the contents to drop the wand from the bottle.  Other brands have nice wide caps.  Not this one.		On the good side, and hence 2 stars vs 1, the bubble liquid is great.		I have an old bottle that has a nice wand and cap opening that I just dumped the liquid into.		Don't buy this for a party... too frustrating.  Get it for the liquid... and definitely not the wand.
1,HORRIBLE!!!! Fishing games like these are usually fun. This one is terrible. The mouths don't open wide enough and don't stay open long enough to catch them. AND when you do get the hook in, the shell doesn't stay on. Even the adults couldn't do this game. This is going back to the store.
1,Later on when my son is older, he will have a blast with this. But for now, it's sitting in a corner collecting dust. My son is almost 17 months old and this scares him too much. He stands a good 20 ft. away and just stares. Way too agressive. This coming from a boy that LOVES to play with water all the time. Just not this type of water delivery system.  He loves to play with water hoses and swim in the pool assisted....this is just way too much for him at this point in time
1,Kind of big for 18 inch doll
1,Smaller than expected. Disappointed.
1,This lioness is absolutely gorgeous on the site but when you see it in person, the details aren't as distinct... I was truly disappointed as this was apart of a gift for my father on Father's Day... Also the piece is really small in comparison to the other pieces sold by Papo.,
1,This is my review for all Boon ducks we have had so far. Love that they can not suck up water, which means no squirting out nasty mold from their mouths. However the base of the duck is situated just so, that there is a crevice around it, which has made a prime spot for water to go and grow mold. The only way we have gotten it out is with a toothpick, but it's never been fully removed and always comes back. So either try the bottom of the duck off well, or you'll end up with mold over time.
