0,Very good for a gluten-free bread, it tastes and feels almost like regular sandwich bread.  I would buy it again.
0,I having been using a Mr. Coffee Coffee Latte to make delicious latte coffees. I read that this flavor enhances the taste and it does. The dispenser works very well. I am very satisfied with this purchase.
0,This potato chip is amazing!  Each chip is crisp and enticing.		I ordered this in July and the Best Used By date was 30 October. Of course in my home, they would never last that long! The chips are safely stored in the thick bag and to my astonishment, there seemed to be no broken chips and the bag actually looked full when I opened it (none of that 1/3 full bag after settling stuff).		The ingredients are simple and natural: potato, oil, sea salt.  The bag of 8.5 oz provides about 8 servings.		The chips themselves are as described by the maker: bold flavor and have a hearty crunch. Each chip has a unique look like a fine piece of art that makes the mouth water in anticipation.  And let me tell you, they taste heavenly.		Only potential drawbacks: 1) they are really crisp and may cause some discomfort if your mouth/gums are sensitive/sore, and 2) it is difficult to eat only the suggested serving of only 13 chips.		Overall, awesome, and mean AWESOME chip!
0,Great coffee
0,good taste
0,Pack these bags in lunch pails daily....great size for snacking as well....I buy over and over!
0,Delicious.
0,Crunchy and tasty snack!!!
0,I have been using this product for quite some some.  The only difference is earlier I purchased from a different source and this time through Amazon.  its quality is very goof.  I am satisfied.	kazim
0,This is my favorite flavor for my Keurig machine...I try others but always come back to this one. I ALWAYS have this one in my carousel!
0,Very good taste i will be buying more
0,This pancake/waffle mix is so perfect.  It's smooth and the pancakes are so fluffy. Add bananas,  strawberries, blueberries, cooked apples, whatever you like, it's all good!
0,Perfect for baking, fair price, easy to use and I like that it is organic. I highly recommend this product.
0,An all organic tea that is sooo delicious and sooo good for you to drink! High in antioxidants and anti inflammatory fighting too!
0,Organic and gluten free. Low sodium too.  Very tasty.  The best teriyaki sauce we've found anywhere.
0,These are the best shortbread biscuits; just flour, sugar, butter, and salt, and amazingly good. No biscuits were broken but they were strewn about the packets. Tin has four separate packets. Stickers were present on the tin, as another buyer noted. The tin itself, which is identical to the tin pictured on the product page, was received with no dents. The expiration date is one year away so these biscuits are quite fresh.
0,Chickens love this in their nesting herb mix.
0,nestle toll house semi sweet chocolate morsels  are good.
0,Great favor
0,Of all the teas that Twinings has to market, I love the Prince of Wales the best.  I can drink it all day long -- It's a wonderful picker-upper.  I drink it without milk or sugar.  Of course, to do this, I do not brew it the 3 to 5 minutes that Twinings recommends -- a pleasing tea color will let you know.  Once in a while, in the afternoon, a touch of honey does the trick to further brighten my pick-me-up.
0,Love this malted milk powder. If you like a good malted milk then this is the one to buy.	+ You can mix this up in milk but you will need an immersion/stick blender (if you buy one get one with a container to mix shakes, etc. in)
0,I drink a LOT of tea, bags are still my preferred choice. I tried these out of curiosity - they are definitely good, just hard to justify the price
0,Bob's Red Mill Whole Wheat Flour is a favorite of mine for bread baking.  I think it is finer than others I have tried and the pricing is reasonable.  I wish I could get it in 25 lb. packages.
0,This Espresso is pre-ground espresso which is nice.  It actually makes a good cup of espresso and tastes better than others that I have tried.  I had been on a mission to try to find espresso that I liked equal to or better than starbucks. I like the sweet caramelly smell that the starbucks espresso beans have which this one lacked. That could be a plus for some but just not what I was looking for. These espresso beans are dark but to compare again, they are not as dark as the starbucks dark  espresso roast.
0,Great product at an affordable price.  Mixes smoothly into a smoothie, mild flavor.  I've made hot tea and it dissolves very smoothly in hot water without any grit or lumpiness.
0,My wife drinks only K cups and only this flavor, these were the cheapest at .57 cents per cup. It came timely and she is drinking them
0,Good product, good price, fast delivery!
0,Really good & not gritty like some quinoa.  I still rinse it though.
0,Husband loves it.
0,The nuts were great will buy from again
0,I LOVE the taste of this cashew butter! It is very sweet and has an extremely creamy and smooth texture! I use it often on my GF muffins I make- the taste is not predominate but goes with all flavors very well!
0,Delicious PB, worth trying but way to expensive to make it a regular PB
0,yummmmmmy... tasted great
0,It has been my favorite snack all the time, especially when you have classes that take over your lunch time. Candy is chewy and tasty which definitely helps comfort your stomach during class time! Good treat to initiate conversation too :)
0,Extremely fresh and delicious.  Arrived very fast.  First time purchasing this brand but will look into their other products now.
0,Taste great especially on vanilla ice cream, or just plain,I wait until the ice cream melts a bit and mix it up and wow it's great
0,Nice bold coffee
0,Tastes pretty good to my 5 year old, she is asking for more bars after finishing one.  Organic and simple ingredients, things I recognize as food!  My only wish was that the serving portion was bigger.
0,I have been trying to find a product to replace my 1/2 & 1/2 and I believe I've finally found it. I use more than the recommended amount, about the same amount I used of the cream but so much less fat! I still use no sugar also. Very pleased with the taste! Finally!!
0,I love tea, and I love Stash Tea. I especially love their Double Bergamot Earl Grey. Just discovered the Breakfast in Paris, which is just the perfect alternative to my usual Assam or Barry's Irish or other stronger black tea.
0,Good smooth coffee taste.  Will order again
0,Great taste and pretty economical too. Hard to find in stores, so its nice to have it available on Amazon.
0,Hard to find in stores but delicious
0,I know I love these way too much.  This is better than any candy bar, so it can not be as good for you as they say.  I love them though!
0,I bought these for various creatures, mostly birds, squirrels and chipmunks and they love them.  I enjoy them too!
0,Pros:	Taste Good	Nice and chewy	Healthy	Filling	Cons:	Pricey
0,great taste and good price, healthy bars, satisfying and keeps hunger away for hours
0,I have never been able to drink coffee. I believe I have the slow caffeine gene so I don't metabolize it. Even decaf causes issues for me. Sometimes I just smell decaf and I get a bit of a headache. I can drink this stuff on an empty stomach and I get no bad effects. Its the first time in my life I can drink any kind of coffee and feel fine.  I guess Dave Aspreys claims that its the mold toxins in coffee and not necessarily the residual caffeine even in decaf that causes the problems.  Important to note Im doing at the bulletproof way with grass fed gi or grass fed unsalted butter and not with milk. According to the scientific research putting milk in coffee blocks the polyphenols which are extremely highly active antioxidants.
0,This honey is DELICIOUS!!!
0,A penny for 20 lb pumpkins, what isn't to love
0,I've tried a lot of brands of vanilla over the years, and yes, some of the boutique brands taste better when you do a sampling. but when you're using a teaspoon in a batch of cookies or a layer cake, I doubt anyone would be able to tell one from the other. I use one of these quarts in less than a year, so being able to buy it in large quantity is a benefit, for sure.
0,Now I can make my favorite latte's at home!
0,AAAAAAAAAAA
0,My husband eats a peanut butter and strawberry jam sandwich for breakfast every day, and sometimes as a midnight snack. I typically buy the regular creamy Peter Pan peanut butter, since it doesn't have HFCS but still tastes like traditional peanut butter. We go through a LOT of it, as you can imagine.		This stuff with the honey - UNREAL. It really was like a treat, like eating Nutella but with less guilt. I wanted to make cookies with it, but the jar pretty much disappeared before I could eat more than a spoonful or two. This is definitely going on the repurchase list.
0,I love the tea. I like to have tea every morning this was recommended to me by a friend. I will definitely order it again. The price is amazing for the quantity. It costs more at The Fresh Market for 60 bags than this does for 160 bags.
0,Good olive oil at a reasonable price.  Quality compares well against the better imports.  I will be reordering.  Bragg is always a good quality product.
0,Kids enjoyed it
0,I was pleasantly surprised at the mild taste. I use these in stir fry. They are beautifully and carefully packaged, and they arrive timely. Excellent healthy product.
0,Can't stop eating them. Friends will ask for them : )
0,good for smoothies
0,Love this basmati rice! It cooks up beautifully in the rice cooker and has a super creamy texture. Big fan.
0,This is one of the best teas from England. 1 bag tends to make a whole pot. We usually have to purchase them in a specialty shop so we were over happy to have it delivered by Amazon. Have some around in t	Regular and decaf. Like it all the time.
0,This is decent coffee, but it doesn't taste very vanilla-y or caramel-y.  It's not too bold - I hate bitter coffee.  Anyway, a little vanilla/caramel creamer brings out the flavor in the coffee.  It's got a good coffee flavor, just not a FLAVORED coffee flavor.
0,Super product. Bob's Red Mill fits the bill for many other products  too!!
0,Perfect and great price.
0,My baby loves the lollipops very much.
0,I found it to be a trade-off. Not that great of a taste, but very simple and easy to make, and a lot better tasting than Lipton's and Nestea's powdered offerings. Each packet makes half a gallon, but I like to use two to make it stronger and give it more of a Luzianne taste. I think the reason a lot of people don't like it is that they're mixing it wrong and using a packet per gallon.
0,Tea is a winter drink for me, so I decided to try this Rishi Organic Silver Needle Jasmine Loose Tea offered on Vine. It came in a pretty and functional little double-capped canister and welcomed me with its rich herbal aroma. The leaves are "withered" and look quite unprocessed and natural. I followed the directions -- one tablespoon in my little tea ball, bring water to a rolling boil and then cool a bit, steep 5 minutes -- and brewed a cup to enjoy on a blustery cold afternoon instead of my usual coffee.		Rishi imports tea that is certified organic and fair trade. The company was founded on a basis of social responsibility and sustainability, to offer consumers fine single variety teas direct from their origin. This white tea -- very low in caffeine and high in antioxidants -- originates in China's Fujian province and is infused with jasmine flowers for a subtle fragrant product. My cup of tea had a light, slightly floral flavor with no trace of harshness, and as directed by the package, I used the same tablespoon of tea to brew a second cup and enjoyed it just as much.		I choose fair trade coffee whenever possible, but haven't explored the "artisan tea" world. This Rishi Organic Silver Needle Jasmine Loose Tea is very appealing and I know I'll enjoy it -- and now I'm eager to try some of their other varieties. Produced organically and sustainably, it's not just a cup of tea but a link to ancient knowledge and traditions.		Linda Bulger, 2008
0,What can you say, it's coconut water.  It's pure and natural.	We drink it right from the container out of the fridge and also use it for a tasty cocktail mixer with Coconut flavored vodka.
0,This coffee drink has gotten me so hooked that I have to keep 4 spare cans around all the time.  This is a really rich, creamy, and tasty drink.  This is so rich that it makes a nice head of creamy foam on the top. It smokes the Starbucks DIY pumpkin spice latte.  Maxwell House pumpkin spice latte is the bomb!  Try it and I bet you'll be spoiled by this especially if you like pumpkin spice drinks.
0,Great stuff. Easy to use. Very portable. I have a jar at work and one at home. No more measuring or screwing around with a block of butter and a jar of coconut oil
0,No problems
0,2.5 pounds but was disappointed  because  it wasn't  organic. Flavorful  otherwise .
0,I only bought these to make coconut-almond-chocolate rice Krispy treats as well as maple-bacon rice Krispy treats and this cereal was very fresh and made delicious yum-yums.
0,Mild, "dry", not bitter, light tea. I mix with cranberry juice and drink it by the quart! Nice, even caffeine level - no buzz or jitters! Its one of the better Darjeeling teas I've found, and the best tea-bag version out there. Its a close match to many second flush (summer harvest), single estate brands I've tried and better than some! Price is great.
0,This cereal is similar in size and shape to Mini Wheats, however it is much lighter and crispier. It has a sweet taste that would make you think it has far more than its 120 calories. One of the best things is that it packs a protein punch: (12g) per serving. That is better than some alleged protein bars! Overall it has a great cinnamon flavor that never gets old. Highly recommended!
0,Love this, the bread tastes amazing and is great for sandwiches or just to eat!
0,About 1/3 were dark or espresso varieties, 1/3 were light/medium varieties and about 1/3 were flavored coffees- There are other Sampler packs here on Amazon if you are looking for more flavors, or specifically for unflavored coffee.  But this is a nice mix if you entertain or have a household that likes various types of coffee.  I will likely give the dark roasts and espresso cups to some friends who specifically love them but are very finicky about coffee, so they can decide on their favorites.  Brands are mostly GM, Crazy Cups, Marley, Brooklyn Beans, Martinson, ECS,Brown Gold, Coffee People, Peets, Ecocups, Caza Trail, Second Cup.  1 each of 8 Oclock, Jetsetter, Emeril, Hawaiian Isles.		PS. If you want all flavored coffees, teas and cocoas, get the flavored coffee sampler, or the tea and cocoa coffee sampler.  If you do not like flavored coffee and only want strong dark roasts, get the dark roast sampler.  This is what it is- and it doesn't deserve to be panned due to you picking the wrong sampler, people!
0,Was not sure about this one, but really liked it.  Has a great aroma and since I am a cream in the coffee person it makes a great morning treat. Rich and good.
0,This is a full bodied, caffeinated tea that I have enjoyed for years. Numi makes wonderful tea! I also like the Numi Emperor's Puerh to drink after a meal.
0,good
0,Love, love, love these!  I'd originally tried them at my local grocery store.  They now carry the regular but not the GF.  So, I was so excited when I found I could purchase these online.  They are a wonderful GF, crunchy snack!
0,I liked this Maple Syrup so much that I ordered  it twice and will.order it again when this jug is empty. I now use it  instead of sugar in my coffee	and oatmeal.
0,I like all three flavors. The mocha seems the sweetest. I enjoy them for the healthy ingredients, fiber and protein content. I keep coming back to these and give them as gifts.
0,It's.....pasta.
0,My son and I aren't big fans of these crackers, but it was a filler item for my prime pantry box. I figure it'll be a good snack when everything in the cupboards run out until our next grocery shopping day. We've had these before and they taste really dry. They're not bad. They're just not our favorites
0,Doesn't even feel like you're eating healthy but yet you are. Lol healthy esting is surprising yummy. It's leaves you feeling satisfied and gives you enough Sweetness that your not craving the unhealthy sugary stuff
0,Missing the Halva available at neighborhood delis, it was nice to discover Parthenon Foods.  The one-pound marbled Halva disappeared really quickly and was delicious as I remembered local offerings.  Highly recommend. -- Priscilla
0,I love having this on hand.  If I don't use the whole jar, I just put the rest of the jar in the freezer.
0,My children and husband love these breakfast biscuits for when we are on the go and cant get in a meal, the blueberry is very tasty
0,Great price for a great spice mix
0,Fast & convenient, plus tastes good. Glad to have found Enjoy Life.
0,We love these and got a great bargain by buying them via subscribe and save on amazon. We finish them before the next shipment comes!
0,This is the best chai tea I have EVER tasted	Nice and spicy	Package was small and worth it
0,Out of a 12 flavor mix, the only one that we didn't love is the banana (it just doesn't have enough flavor, but then bananas really don't).  Each flavor is really distinct and different and even being packaged together doesn't seem to affect that.  A fabulous treat, my favorite meal!
0,Really great oatmeal! Different texture, but I love it.
0,Tasty and gluten free.  The crackers have a good crunch to them.
0,We love these. Tastes like orange pop without all the bad stuff.
0,I have been trying variety packs from amazon for awhile and these are the tastiest.  I don't believe they are high in caffeine but the flavors are great.  There was only one I didn't like but it was because it was too strong (town donut shop).  Really great coffee, will order again.
0,These were a gift for my mother and she loves them-
0,It tastes exactly like regular biscotti, only this has no wheat or gluten in it. The texture is exactly like the wheat-based biscotti-- perfect when dipped in coffee or tea, very hard and dry when not dipped. That's how they're supposed to be, and these are perfect. I like the chocolate and lemon ones too, but the almond anise is my favorite. I love them because they're a great snack with a cup of coffee or tea to tide me over to a meal, but they're more like toast in that I'm not tempted to pig out on a box of them like I would if I had cookies in the house!
0,Awesome. How cool that this drink is back on the market. Just make sure you get a good deal on it
0,This is a good earl Grey tea - for the money.  I've had better, but at a much higher price point.
0,Delicious tea, will buy again.
0,Great.. Did what I needed it to. Kills weeds instantly!
0,Satisfies my 'cheese' junk food craving.  Still kind of 'junk food' but certainly healthier than the traditional cheese puff.
0,I ordered the two-pack Nutiva Coconut Oil (15 oz each) and they both arrived in perfect condition.  It's been very warm since it's summer so these arrived in liquid form and there were no leakage at all and I am very happy about that.  I have been using coconut oil for cooking and oil pulling and have used many different brands of coconut oil -- I can tell if the coconut oil is of high quality and Nutiva is definitely of high quality.  Nutiva has that great, mild coconut taste I love in expensive coconut oil.  5 shining stars would be my rating for this item!
0,I LIKE TO USE IT ON EGGS, INSTEAD OF SALT AND PEPPER
0,Xlnt products always
0,I always buy this brand of creamer as it is finer than Cremora and other brands and dissolves faster.
0,Love this brand of sugar fee Carmel for my hot cocoa.
0,I love these! They taste incredible, and are a great crunchy snack. I've been very low carb (ketogenic) for almost three years and sometimes snacks are hard to find. These are a perfect option.		Light, great tasting, and filling.		As has been said in other reviews, at the time of this writing the price on Amazon is almost double that of Costco so shop around
0,What a great price for such yummy coconut oil!  I had given up buying it as got burned from online company who does not give you the respect and care as does Amazon. Never have found any C.O. as good as this.  This is the real deal! Before you even taste it, you KNOW it's what it says it is....pure good real organic coconut oil! So glad I bought two.
0,Best popcorn I've tried. The kernels are smaller than Orville, but more of them pop and they taste fresher.
0,This Organic Cool Mint Chocolate and the Coconut Chocolate Chip are the two best flavors Clif makes, in my opinion.  Have tried 'em all!  Them Cool Mint Chocolate is soft, chewy, and dense - think a heavy peppermint party or a soft version of a chocolate mint Girl Scout cookie.  Very satisfying with no cardboard or sawdust-like aftertaste.  Just deliciousness!
0,All that soy sauce for under 20 bucks.  Bring on the California rolls and the shrimp shashimi.  And it is the name brand of Kikoman as well.  Who can beat that.
0,Love the candy, but made the mistake of ordering it in the summertime - the bars were melted - what a mess!
0,This tea tastes pretty good with the mix of Sencha and Matcha (sweet powdered) green teas. I make it with more than one tea bag per cup and I use water that it not too hot to touch on ones finger otherwise bitterness will be tasted. I would like more matcha powder per tea bag; but compared with straight Sencha tea this is a little sweeter yet with mild flavor when made with two or more tea bags. I have bought it a number of times.
0,This makes a great cup of coffee, great flavor and it smells so good too.  I really enjoy this coffee.
0,Great and tasty k cup
0,Product as advertised. Good product. But, caveat -- very high fat content, so use sparingly.
0,My favorite brand of chip.  If you like Jalapeo you have to try these chips.  The flavor of Kettle brand is fantastic.  I would highly recommend these chips to anyone.
0,Its what suppose to be just right fresh walnut taste !!!.. Try soak in 40 gr of walnut distilled water wait over night in fridge take out eat it..You will feel like eating real fresh walnut.. Who ever eat really fresh walnut going to understand me and thank me too:)
0,I purchased these because my hubby loves strawberries and I thought it would be a neat stocking stuffer gift as well.  What I ended up with is an addiction!  These are GREAT!		They have a very clean strawberry taste and a hint of cool mint to freshen your breath.  I've had comments that people can smell the strawberry when in nearby proximity. How great is that?  They do their job of freshening your breath and are a yummy, calorie-free treat to boot.		Try them, but be forewarned!  I just ordered my second pack of 8. I love them, my kids and grandkids love them, and my hubby does as well. Icebreakers Duos; what an awesome idea!
0,This coconut oil is awesome!  I love the easy use container and the price is out of this world!! It is such a light, creamy coconut oil. I use it for both cooking and soap making.
0,A versatile drink.  Hot or cold and tastes greate.
0,found this on a best coffee review- it is great if you like a dark roast
0,tastes great
0,great for my Asian cooking
0,I love these berry bites, I've had them before. I'm pre-diabetic so I can tell when I get hungry I need something right now. I keep these in my car, on my nightstand, in my purse for when I need something right away. They keep me full for quite awhile so I'll also have some if I know I won't be able to eat for awhile.	They have a nice taste and aren't too dry to be eaten alone.	However - I seem to have trouble with ordering food on Amazon. These arrived with only 3 months left before the expiry date. It matters when the box is so big and you don't want these to get stale.
0,I was looking for a sweetener for iced coffee and tea and this is great. No fake taste or bad after taste
0,am waiting to see them grow
0,I usually buy these in Walmart. They taste great n now they came to my house .  They were a drop more in price than Walmart but I didn't spend the gas and time going to Walmart. I would like to see them packaged in several boxes like the fiber bars are boxed.  This  box is big and  in order to hold all of the 38 brownies n I don't have that much room in my pantry.
0,These walnuts are excellent. I'm on my second order. They are fresh, delicious and nicely priced. Prompt delivery, too.
0,I was born in the south and butter beans were very popular....your beaans bring back some really good eating....thanks
0,I just switched from Bombay Sapphire Martinis to Manhattan's and I was telling my friend how I make them.  I said I was using maraschino cherries and she said no you should be using "Bada Bing" Cherries.  Was she ever correct.  The problem is I can't put just one in my Manhattan I need two.  I just looked at them at Total Wine and same bottle I buy on Amazon at the box of 4 comes to $5.78 a bottle and Total Wine is $8.99 a bottle.  I just started drinking Manhattan's In September and I'm currently on my 10th jar of "Bada Bings.  A small teaspoon of juice make the Manhattan even better.
0,These cookies are alright, The packaging makes them somewhat easy to grab as a take along snack. As far as I'm concerned they're better than Chips Ahoy, a little bit different but not any better or worse than Famous Amos.  Children will probably enjoy them in their lunches and they are easy to keep in your desk at work. I kind of like Famous Amos, and I like these OK. They're nothing to get excited over for me but someone at work who I shared them with absolutely loved them and couldn't get enough. In this case I think you just have to try them and judge for yourself.
0,If you like decaf coffee this is a nice selection of different kinds of decaf.
0,Outstanding b.rice only brand I buy. Great packaging and fast delivery.
0,It is tasty but it's too expensive. I'll try to find some locally.
0,My wife is allergic to peanuts, and most alternatives are expensive.  SunButter seems to be some of the least expensive options, and tastes great as well!  Especially the crunchy variation - there isn't much like that in the non-PB realm.  I've never needed to stir it up, it's always seemed perfectly creamy, though often most of the crunchies are near the top of the container, so you might want to stir it some to even that out.
0,I live alone and when I purchase a bottle of honey it turns to sugar before I use it all up. These packets are just the right size for a biscuit.
0,Good product with a great taste	God Bless
0,This stuff is just fantastic. I have to make sure I only eat one bag a day from the box of 12 I ordered. but 12 bags X 26.4 ounces, or 1.22 pounds.	At $71 presuming you have Amazon Prime free shipping, that is  $58.20 per POUND! Seems insanely expensive for jazzy seaweed. Price-Value is just out of whack.	Taste: 5+ stars.  Price: 1 star, if that.
0,I purchased two of these because my brother and my sister love coffee.	I had some good feedback from them and even had some of the biscotti and coffee with my sister and it was actually not bad (I was sort of expecting what you get from pre-packaged gift boxes) anyway, the taste was pretty good and the biscotti was crisp.	All in all, this gift was a win win in the cost department and the quality department.
0,will definitely order again when I run out. good value for the price
0,good
0,This item tastes great! I would buy it again. They make a wonderful snack but it is hard to eat just one package!
0,I've tried xylitol made from corn before and had all manner of negative GI reactions to it, but this xylitol (made from Birch hardwood) has given me zero problems. I'm on my second bag now!
0,I love this tea, I drink it all the time.  I often throw it in with other teas as well, like green tea or davidsons spring fruit and flowers.  My only reason for 4 stars is that there are a lot of smaller shavings of some sort, i guess leaves or petals, don't know what it actually is.  There is a good amount of it mixed in with the tea. But you get a ton of tea so not a big deal.  Still would recommend it.
0,Teach a man to fish and he'll eat for life or teach a man to buy from Amazon and he won't need to go fishing.  Tasty Salmon.
0,I have never even eaten these but buy them for my dogs because I do not trust dog food companies.  However, I recently realized they have some spices in them that may not be good for my dogs so I will have to stop using them.
0,Keep in mind Amazon has not updated the picture of the product.  But overall satisfied.  The saladitos are suppose to be dry and salty.  I recently discovered these salty plums from a family member.  You eat them with a lime or orange.  I squeak lime on it and let it soak a little and its just delicious.  I can't wait to try it with pepino or with a Corona.  :)  They can be addicting - but can probably be not good for your high blood pressure because of the salt.	Thanks again.  Big bag for the price.
0,excellent
0,Arrived very fast, cost was reasonable and I myself can tell a difference when I take this, Everyone is not the same but for me , it works! There was some heavier left in the bottom of the bottle and I just added some water to it and shook the bottle let it sit and I was able to get all of it out. Very happy with my purchase.
0,very good as seasoning
0,This is superior. You will not find a better product. I've tried them all.	It's more than I can afford currently, but I do recommend.
0,I can't touch them but my boyfriend and dad love them!
0,Other than making some people I know burp after consuming, I have NOT found anybody who doesn't like these little candies!  Thank you for such a GREAT product!!!
0,This coffee makes excellent iced coffees. The flavor is robust, deep, with chocolate undertones--not at all burned tasting or bitter. The fragrant taste is able to shine through, even with the addition of creamer and sugar. I was able to make it according to the directions, and I didn't have to "double-up" the way some coffees need you to. I finely ground the beans in my grinder and used my french press. I like to get the water temperature to about 200 degrees Fahrenheit before I pour the water. I let it steep in my press for about one minute. I thought the price for this coffee was amazing. I hope it becomes available again at the same price. I will buy again.
0,Arizona Diet Green Tea is my absolute favorite soft drink, and the fact is that I ONLY drink this or water.	I will say that nothing is as good as this flavor bought in the GLASS bottles (there's something about the plastic bottles that changes the flavor). However, for cost and convenience, these packets come very close.	Other than the great flavor, two things that make this stand out from other sugar free iced tea mixes is that it completely dissolves easily. There is NEVER any residue at the bottom of the bottle, and unlike some other mixes (Crystal Light for example), this doesn't cause acid reflux. That last part may not apply to everyone, but may be important to some (like me).	Highly recommended, especially at the subscribe & save price. A friend of mine bragged that she buys these for only $2 a box at Walgreen's, but I noticed that hers only have 8 per box ($0.25 per packet), while these have 10 per box ($0.2485 per packet at the current S&S price), so these are the same.	Since Poland Spring bottles go on sale all the time for $3.99 for a case of 24, the total cost for a bottle of Arizona Diet Green Tea is about $0.41. When stores are selling cold 20 oz bottles of soda for $1.50, $0.41 seems pretty inexpensive to me. It's even less if you get your Poland Spring at Costco or some other price club.
0,Love it: I sprinkle it directly on my cooked cauliflower  or in potato chowder for tasty low-fat cheesiness!
0,Delicious sugar free candy.
0,Good product
0,excellent product
0,tasty powder and very economical.
0,I continue to reorder the variety pack because of the VARIETY! I am not a one coffee person...there is a but to that, I did find a coffee that I really liked so I did end up ordering that brand also.
0,Good price and value but would prefer organic.
0,Wonderful price and taste!
0,Love the eggs but they could be packaged better. Seems like there's at least 3 broken every time.
0,y good Quality.
0,Great tea before bed. Very smooth and flavorful.
0,Love this sweetener! I wish they could be shipped to FPO address again! It is delicious and a healthier alternative to sugar.
0,Love stevia
0,Tastes great and is calming.
0,These are TOO GOOD, honestly now! ;D I am trying to quit smoking, and these have been an absolute godsend, I swear. Loads of real cherry flavor without the nausea- inducing aftertaste of corn syrup or artificial flavorings. I've noticed a nice little boost from the Vitamin C, but not so much as to upset the stomach. These are so delectable, I really will resolve to try more flavors when they run out (which shouldn't be too long now!)
0,As I have stated in my other reviews, I love these bars. They are super chocolatey and crunchy and very tasty. Try these for a sweet treat.
0,great ....roasted med dark
0,Excellent for on the go, and for glucose emergencies-without added calories. Diabetics make note! I had been looking everywhere for this, and Amazon's arrangements with other sellers ( esp  the add-on programma) made it possible for me to purchase. This product cannot be found in my area, and is a medical need. Thank You,Amazon!
0,I got this umami powder on a whim not really knowing what I was ordering but once I got it I was HOOKED! This stuff tastes SOOOOOO delicious.. I've put it on steaks, salads, soups and it has single handedly made every single thing taste better! I can literally eat this stuff with a spoon but I try not to do that because it does have a little saltiness and I'm sure that can't be too healthy! haha.. Love the stuff and will definitely order again!
0,Excellent service. Great product.
0,I am a huge fan of PG tips, but sometimes I need decaf in the evening if I am getting ready to go to bed.  These PG tips decaf tea bags are perfect.  They taste just like the regular PG tips but without the caffeine hit!  If you have never tried PG tips you will love them.  They are what they would call in the States a 'medium' breakfast tea.  I grew up with them in England & so had to have them when I moved to the States.  Smooth flavor, but stronger than the American breakfast teas I have found.  Simply put the tea bag in the mug.  Add boiling water, stir a tiny bit, then leave to sit for about 1 minute to 'stew'.  Then pick the tea bag out, pressing on the side of the mug to get all those juices out.  Add milk, sugar or honey to your liking & a perfect cup of tea!
0,So pleased. This is my favorite, and so glad to find it here in the 64-ounce size...use it all the time! Delicious.
0,Best Brown rice there is.
0,I really love this. I use it in my coffee.
0,tasty stuff and healthy
0,When you are lacking funds or just want to reminisce about being in college again Ramen never fails to be a yummy treat. The best part is it keeps the employees in the office a little longer.
0,Excellent stuff! Better than the last cumin i ordered!
0,yes, they were wonderfully fresh and tasty sweet
0,So happy to find Gluten Free Bisquick, I have been baking biscuits like crazy!!  I used regular bisquick when I was younger because it was always so easy to use and great flavored biscuits.
0,great flavor
0,always using cocoa and this is a big size...great stuff.
0,I am a recent convert to gum. My dental hygienist gave me a sample and told me of the way it promoted good dental hygiene. I loved the flavor and subsequently tried most of the Orbit gums until I settled on Wintermint.		According to a card enclosed with my sample this gum works by causing increased saliva, which in turn neutralizes acids. Another point made by the card is that the increased saliva can also help prevent early tooth damage and decay. While I am sure most chewing gums will trigger an increase in saliva, this one is sugar free.		Nutritionally a stick of this is less than five calories, contains no sodium, and only a single gram of carbs. It's sugar-free (otherwise I doubt it would have the ringing endorsements of the American Dental Association), and it leaves my mouth fresh. I typically chew a piece between meals to keep my mouth fresh and to add one more layer to my dental hygiene regimen. It's too early to tell how effective it is in the long term, but my mouth feels cleaner.
0,I highly recommend
0,Bought these off Ramenbox.com and I was pleasantly surprised by the noddles. I did not know what to except because I could not figure out what flavor they were. Still unsure even after tasting them how to describe the flavor but it is definitely hint sweetness that is for sure.
0,This is our FAVORITE kind of basmati rice.  Cooks up beautifully in our rice cooker too.  So glad Amazon carries the huge bags so we don't have to buy the tiny ones at Whole Foods!
0,Pure heat.  Be very careful with this stuff.  I am using it to make my hot sauce a little hotter.
0,so good.
1,I am throwing in the trash the two of these that I have.  I had no idea they are soy beans from China!!  The USA grows fields and fields of soy beans, why would I buy from China?!  Arkansas and CA grows fields of them.  Who knows what is sprayed on them.  I wish I had read more carefully.  Too bad, they tasted decent, and high in fiber.  They may be packaged in CA but apparently grown in China.
1,to weak not a very good flavor
1,Weird.  Did they have a vat of Mapeline or something sitting around and wanted to use it up?  Maple isn't a Chai flavor.  Now, if they advertised this as Maple tea with spices, it still wouldn't be very good, but it wouldn't be such false advertising either.  Chai seems to be one of those products where people throw in just about everything they can think of, whether its good or not.  I've seen licorice, sage, star anise, all sorts of weird stuff, but Maple is probably the strangest.  There is a very off-putting sub flavor here as well, under the maple that I can't identify but it's definitely something that shouldn't be in chai, maybe curry.  Oh well, live and learn.  I'll go back to buying my Chai at either Upton's or the Tea Farm.  Both produce an excellent product at a reasonable price.
1,the tops on the pods split at the edges during the brew cycle.  this should case should not have passed quality control.  while the flavor is good, it is not worth the mess.
1,I like my nespresso as an easy no nonsense espresso machine, but this coffee is downright disgusting. Do. Not. Buy.
1,YUCK. YUCK. Yuck.
1,The description promises:	 "A kick of jalapeno pepper for a zestier tuna recipe is the best way to describe our Bumble Bee prime fillet albacore tuna with Jalapenos and olive oil. Try this explosion of heat and our highest quality albacore tuna on pizza, sandwiches, quesadillas and more for a taste adventure."	They lied. No kick. No zestie. No explosion.	I should have known. But I was hopeful.	It is nice tuna, but there really isn't any point in buying this. You can barely tell there is any jalapeno in it.
1,These are so-so chips. The flavor is a bit too sweet and they don't melt well in your mouth compared to other brands. I wouldn't purchase these again.
1,I found this almond milk way too sweet. It does not taste like milk at all. It tastes like a thick soft drink with too much sugar. Sure enough, cane sugar is one of the main ingredients. Half or less of the sugar, fewer thickeners and it would be OK.
1,Perhaps my case was mistakenly made with way too much sugar, but it was almost like drinking syrup. Yuk Does it take a genius to not understand natural sweetness in apple & pineapple juice. Cane sugar is all wrong, smart idea would have been little maple or coconut sugar.
1,disappointed in the level of flavor - not only a week coffee, but very little maple flavor.
1,My family loves Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Stevia. After purchasing the 3 pack boxes twice, from Amazon, I decided to save some money and invest in the 1000 packet box. When the box was delivered, it seemed a little sticky. When I unpacked the inner carton from the delivery box, I found that the vendors carton was sticky all over the outside of the box. Upon opening the carton, the stickiness was even worse inside, covering the individual packets. I was disappointed, thinking that loose powdered sweetener must have spilled into the box when it was packed, but I stored the carton believing there was nothing to worry about. After finishing our last small box of Stevia, I removed some of the packets from the bulk carton I had stored, to put into our counter top dispenser and found that MANY of the individual packets were not completely sealed! This is where the stickiness had come from - leaky packets had partially emptied into the carton. I was dismayed.  It would appear that, after spending over 60 dollars on the bulk package, I didn't save money at all, and have a mess on my hands to boot. I may be looking for another source of stevia.
1,The rice has a sour aftertaste.
1,Didn't like the flavor
1,Didnt tadtr right.
1,I heard about this gum on a radio program--with a respected physician encouraging his listeners to use Spry gum.  I ordered the 600-piece jar, and it was fairly pricey.  However, I found that you needed two or three pieces for a good "chew," and the flavor  lasted only 2-3 minutes. My husband didn't like the gum at all. I threw away 3/4 of the jar after owning it for a few weeks.  Certainly not worth the price.
1,These tasted OK but I don't think they're very low in carbs.
1,.....first, this "Eden Organic" item lacks the USDA Organic certification on the front label which indicates either 100% or 95% organic ingredients.  It does contain a certification on the side label which by my research indicates only less than 75% of the contents as organic.  Second, on the company website there is an announcement that the company disagrees with the "low standards" of the USDA and have withdrawn from certification.  The company also states that their organic standards are much higher than that of the USDA.  Good luck with determining the truth with this company.
1,I had high hopes for this as a replacement for toxic coffee creamer, but it tastes rancid to me. Ruins my coffee and anything else I try to use if for.	In researching a bit, I read that any fat that gets "powdered" becomes rancid and damaged in the process, so maybe that's what is happening.	I wasted quite a few dollars. It's going in the trash.
1,Purchased from Play Right10, Feb 2018, appx 1/2 of the candies are broken in two and expiration date is March 2018. Not suitable for Easter basket. Bought these almost every year and this seller provided the first bad ones.
1,I really love Kettle brand chips, but these are rather disappointing. There is very little sour cream or onion flavor.
1,not impressed.......should have known by the price...........will never purchase again!
1,It's thick, but narrow so they are smaller than expected when cooked.  Also, the "flavoring" comes out with the  grease and coats the pan more than other brands.
1,I was disappointed to find  that  this product is not spearmint tea as labelled on the box.  It smells like valerian and I suspect it is Traditional Medicinals Nighty Night tea. Traditional Medicinals needs to have better quality control for the labelling of their products.  The first time I ordered it a few months ago I received 100% spearmint tea and it was great.  But now I doubt that I will order it again.
1,Sick and tired of these pumps NEVER WORKING. Once you screw the pump lid on the bottle, you cannot extend the pump. NO instructions of anything tricky required, either. It happens on all sizes, too, not just this one.		I also LOVE how Coffeemate has SPAMMED the reviews with all these people getting free product in exchange for a review.		 SCAM.		Edit: OK so I decided to rip the pump off (because you cannot unscrew it) and when I ripped the nozzle backwards it flew up and worked. Go figure.
1,A 3 out of 5 stars. The packaging for the individual kcups was damaged as well as the kcups themselves. The bottom of the box was full of grounds. I also noticed that most kcups fresh have a bit of a dome. There were many flat and worn. I threw them away for fear of contamination.
1,This is the WORST diet cream soda I have ever tasted in my life. Ever. And I've been drinking diet cream soda for as long as I can remember. This tastes like an awful, awful, awful chemical concoction. I have to just throw it out, what a waste of money. This is nothing even close to A&W or Dr. Brown's or even private label stuff you can get at a store like Safeway. Terrible.
1,This is just ok.  The good news is that it's cheap.  But a few days ago I drank a really high quality (and really expensive) organic coffee and there was absolutely no comparison.  If you put lots of sugar or flavored creamer in your coffee, this might be fine.  But if you drink your coffee with little cream or sugar, get a higher quality coffee.  If you French Press your coffee and love the ritual of making coffee, spend the money for better and fresher beans.
1,I'm guessing from other reviews that I happened to get a bad or old batch. My oil in the entire case is hard as rock and almost impossible to even get out of the bag. I've tried two bags now and it just tastes awful. So dissapointed. These are my favorite kinds of popcorn
1,I use this to help lower blood pressure. I'm no doctor but it works. Doesn't taste like Red-hots or cinnamon rolls.
1,Maybe because it was shipped during summer heat, but it arrived dead. Made a loaf of bread which did not raise. Tested in warm water and found no activity. Unfortunately. They have a no return policy. So I won't order again.
1,This is the 'old' (or first) Solofill K Cup.  It doesn't hold as much coffee as the new model (or the Ekobrew, my personal choice).  You can do better than this for about the same $ or cheaper on sale.
1,Just don't like the fact 3g sugar 3g carbs per serving
1,Very disappointed in these.  Package says that there are pecans in the mix.  I only found 4 in the whole bag.  Also, there are approximately 50+ percent of almonds, although it looks more like 80%.  The majority of the mix is almonds and cashews and not what I was expecting or hoping for at all from the description.  The nuts that are there taste ok, but I would not purchase this product again because it is not a good mixture, meaning fair amounts of each nut.  There are other mixed nuts that have a better mix/distribution of nuts.
1,I didn't like the flavor. Tasted like bitter lemon and no sweetness but if you like lemon water at restaurants def tastes like that
1,I thought it would be a healthy snack but it taste so bad.  it taste like shredded cardboard with a little bit of cheese flavor..i could not finish using this product.
1,Still has that weird cooling sensation aftertaste.
1,85% almonds, 10% peanuts, 8 brazil nuts, 8 pecans, 12 cashews [yes, we counted].  Recommend buying separate cans of the nuts you want and make your own.  Planters must have a deal with the almond growers. [SMH]
1,Very Disappointing!	Way overpriced for school lunch quality meat.		This salami was tasteless, greasy, and closer resembled sausage than salami.		I had one slice of each and threw each one away.	They weren't expired.	But they taste like dog food.		Much better Salami available on Amazon, around the web, and even at your local grocer.		Don't Waste Your Money On This Stuff!!!
1,The only thing good about this item is the tin the brownies come in.		The brownies themselves were AWFUL. I don't know if what I received was just a bad batch or what but these had NO flavor whatsoever.		My husband and twin boys can tear up some freshly made brownies so I expected this tin to be a HUGE hit in my household. My husband... took one bite... chewed a lil bit then spit it out. My twin boys (who will be 3 soon, who ALWAYS answer that they want chocolate when I ask them what they want for lunch) wouldn't even eat these... and they eat EVERYTHING		So I thought, maybe it's just my baking that they adore so I took these to church Sunday night to use as dessert for the youth devo... I'm thinking teenagers and brownies = a winning combination..... let's just say that I did NOT bring home an empty tin. One of them said these brownies tasted like chewy taffy.... unflavored chewy taffy.		Matter of fact that was the biggest complaint... no flavor and way too chewy,.... so chewy that I honestly think from looking at the middle of these brownies that they weren't cooked thru.		I would NOT recommend these to anyone. I was able to purchase these at a discount for review purposes and I'm so mad that I even spent a penny on these brownies... they were that bad.		Between my family and the youth and their parents at church... I couldn't find a single person that actually liked these so it's not just about personal preferences. These were just bad...if you're wanting to send brownies to someone... you'd be better off buying them some mix at the store and sending them that...		 I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I was neither paid nor sponsored for my opinions--positive or otherwise--and all thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own
1,DRY- hard to get down.
1,Strangest coffee ever...smells exactly like a skunk when brewing, doesnt taste like it, but won't buy it again
1,My favorite brand of Chocolate Swirl K cups has been discontinued, so I'm on the hunt to find another fave.  This was a huge disappointment.  No chocolate flavor at all.
1,We wanted a a pasta that was not made from flour. I saw reviews from other sources and was interested.  When  it arrived,  I was surprised at the weight of the packages. This was due to the liquid (water?) it is packaged in. However, the bags burst open and the liquid covered other items in the order, even tho they were in their own box in the order.	Next I noticed the smell. Off putting fishy smell.  Even when the unopened package was rinsed when used later, we could not get over the smell. The taste was not not much better.	It does offer an alternative from regular wheat pasta, just not for a right fit for us.
1,It has an artificial sour taste. I feed it to my dog.
1,only if you hate good coffee
1,STUFF IS CRAP OTHER FLAVORS ARE GREAT BUT STAY AWAY FROM POMEGRANITE AND CHOCOLATE	 TURNS TO RUBBER WITHIN MINUTES. STICK TO SPEARMINT &PEPPERMINT AND WINTERGREEN. THESE ARE YUMMY.
1,Very small servings for the price
1,when buying this i was thinking i will get something that taste very similar to honey but instead it tasted like plastic  suger taste it doesnot work well on tea or coffee or anything u wanna get it sweeten
1,wrapper stuck to candy - un EATable
1,The review descriptions, for the most part, were pretty good. What especially caught my eye was the descriptions about having a "lemony" flavor because I always squeezed lemons on my grape leaves.	To my dismay, I opened one of the cans and first bite discovered the rice had an unpleasant consistency. It wasn't that it was over or under cooked, it just was mushy and flavorless.	I am Greek, have eaten hundreds of grape leaves, and I cannot recommend these nor will I give them to guests.
1,My order was received early December 2016. The outdate on the product was April 2017. I would have really liked to see at least 6-12 months before expiration.		The chocolate chunks were slightly light colored, but not as bad as the picture one of the reviewers posted. Some degree of color variation is understandable because of improper storage conditions and temperature changes (I assume they weren't stored properly). So this is totally acceptable because we are approaching winter in the Midwest and temps have been in the 30's.		The most disappointing thing is the chocolate tastes old and is definitely more dry compared to the bag I purchased locally.		Great alternative for those with food allergies, but you may want to purchase locally and spend a little more money for a fresher product.
1,They eliminated the microwavable lid!  What good is a microwave product with a non-microwavable package?
1,For some reason I thought this was a popcorn product. It is ok but not fantastic... the taste is mediocre. Not much bang for the buck.
1,MR MARIA
1,As a big fan of Clif bars, I was disappointed by this new flavor. I was so looking forward to trying out the carrot cake bar. The texture of this bar is a lot more chunky than the average, smooth chewy Clif bar. There are so many chunks of tough carrots and hardened cream cheese-like chips. I found the spice (nutmeg, clove and cinammon) to be overpowering and the bar was way too sweet. I particularly disliked the strangely tough texture. I love Clif bars, but will not get the carrot cake variety ever again (unless they made improvements, that is).
1,lOVE IT
1,Purcashed twice. First time was perfect but second time it has a very different taste. I have consumed the black cumin seed for years and this is not proper. As if some spices fell in it ... something wrong ... $25 dollars and get a defected product is bad
1,no like
1,Not strong enough.  Sorry I purchased multi-pack.  This is the second Twinings item I have purchased from Amazon that is too weak.
1,I like Couscous and I like lentil soup. Must have been some seasoning in this combination that I didn't like. I just couldn't get it down. My husband was able to eat it, but wasn't very fond of it either.  He thought it was very bland.
1,The citrus in this product has a tendency to be bitter if not vigorously shaken immediately before drinking.  Because of this, this item is not for those who like to sip a bit at a time.  I prefer the coconut water by itself.
1,These arrived a melted, liquid mess....I am sure they would have tasted much better had they not been melted first.
1,Product arrived with all the pretzels melted together. It arrived as a solid block of chocolate pretzels that were no good after having obviously melted and then cooled  back down into a chocolate pretzel ball.
1,I added this to my Atkins diet choices and loved it.  However, today I decided to try the linquine that I'd just purchased via Subscribe & Save (10 boxes for $29.02).  While it was cooking, I thought I'd better make sure that the linguine only had 5g of digestible carbs too, since I had only had the rotini and the lasagne in the past.  So I looked at the box, and where previously it used to say something like, "41g carbohydrates, less 36g undigestible carbohydrates, 5g net carbs," there was absolutely nothing.  Simply 41g carbs in the nutrition info box.  So I asked the internet, and it turns out that the claims related to undigestible carbs were a bunch of hooey.  Dreamfields settled a class action lawsuit on the matter earlier this year.		It's unsettling that this happened months ago and I was entirely unaware of it.  Somehow the news story missed my radar entirely.  Or it was "underreported," as those savvy marketing folks would say.		Don't eat this is if you're trying to do Atkins.  One serving is 2 days worth of carbs (at least in Phase I.)
1,The flavor is much too sweet for a Real Vanilla!
1,Too many raisins, not enough pudding.
1,It had the taste of ice tea powder, like Lipton...I did not like it at all
1,I normally like strong coffee; however, this stuff is entirely too strong for me.  I realize that the taste of coffee, wine, etc. is very particular to each individual; however, this stuff does not even smell good when the seal is broken.  It has a very strong smell of smoke, strong coffee, and burnt coffee.		Not recommended unless this is what you like.
1,The seller is top notch but unfortunately Mary Jane' s are not what they used to be. Barely any filling in the center and its  impossible to remove 100% of tthe wrapper. Necco, please fix it.
1,I tried this and didn't think it had any flavor at all.
1,I tried mixing it with water and drink it but It has a horrible taste I think.
1,Sorry to be different than everyone else who seemed to love these.	 Guess I got a bad batch, they tasted stale and old, the chocolate esp. I had 3 clusters, tossed the others.
1,doesn't agree with my GI track.
1,I normally like the Dr. McDougall's items, but this has a very weird aftertaste and is lacking any spice or decent flavor.  Try some of their other products and avoid this one.
1,Not very impressed
1,If I was reviewing only the beans, I give them 5 stars!  The beans are excellent.  However, ordering them from Amazon is not.  My beans arrived with at least one dent in every can.  After all this time, Amazon hasn't figured out how to ship these without them arriving damaged.
1,Flavor is "blah"! Do not like flavor or texture. Will not  re-order. Unfortunately, I am stuck with 8 boxes --
1,Crappiest quality nuts ever.
1,this is extremely spicy...........
1,Has an off taste to me. It didn't come with a scoop! Good thing I had a scoop from another Designer whey flavor.....Also the container had a dent in the bottom.
1,Cocoa itself might be good quality,but it is supplied with low quality bag. The problem is its weak ziplock closer.	It is too skinny and won't close or hold its content. It must be one size bigger/bolder. The bag stays open in my kitchen cabinet and I hate the poor quality bag.
1,These are NOT Cadbury mini eggs.  They're Hershey.  Cadbury is made in England, but Hershey blocked the import of it to the USA and swindled a deal with them. . They changed to formula to add more sugar and take milk out.  Read the package.  Hershey's.  Google it.
1,These are NOT currants. Do your research on the Web. These are small raisins. They taste like raisins, not currants.  I made the mistake of buying them once. They're fine if you want small raisins, but the price is way too high for what you're getting. I buy real dried currants on Amazon. Bob's Red Mill Black Currants is the only one I've found so far that is really a currant. I also buy them as gifts for friends since you can't find them in the groceries stores anymore.	Update:  I just noticed that Bob's Red Mill Black Currants are no longer real black currants anymore either. The description says they are Zante raisins as well.  :(
1,4 of the 8 cans were severely dented and rusted. Threw them out immediately.
1,I've bought this candy many times before, although this is my first purchase from this vendor, and might I say the first time I was disapointed. They were edible, but far from fresh. Harder than usual, and slightly stale - My first Amazon disapointment. I'll buy these elsewhere in the future, thank you.
1,Didn't realize there was cream added in this just ok would not recommend
1,very poor quality
1,I haven't tried the spice honestly, because when I opened up the box, both jars were opened a little and leaking out in the box. Doesn't this stuff have a better seal? I don't even know if it's just a bad container or they don't normally have seals, but I'm uncomfortable using food products that don't come sealed.
1,I sent this to my mom who is 80 and lives in another town. I saw it on Amazon and knew she liked corned beef hash. When it arrived it was 107 ounces! My mom couldn't lift the can nor open it! I didn't realize that it was restaurant size! I called customer support at Amazon and they were great! They helped to resolve issue.
1,Like the other reviewers stated, I found this cocoa to have a fairly rich chocolate taste but, after I received it, when I read that it had artificial sweeteners in it....I was very upset.  As one reviewer wrote....MIGRAINES cometh!!... after drinking this stuff.  Before I realized how unhealthy this stuff was, I found that it took 3 packets to make a truly rich, large cup of chocolate drink.  Any amount less and it was like drinking colored water.  And it was really very sweet...to my taste any way --> maybe that was the three packets I needed to get the rich chocolate taste.  Frankly, with the articial sweeteners and the small amount you get for the money, I will NOT be buying this product ever again!  I recommend you try it locally if you must ingest artificial sweeteners but I'll stick to Xylitol, truvia, and other natural, non-life threatening ones along with the natural 'dirty' sugars.
1,My disappointment in their lack of varied mixed flavors being inside of these boxed in the last FOUR ordered boxes has fallen WAY BELOW quality control standards.	Out of two full boxes that arrived (200 pops total) There was only TWO Apple flavors - and SIX sour cherry -- sadder still is that the ONE flavor that I don't really care for, the Blue Raspberry, literally took over the two boxes! Heck it even looked like the order could have been a single flavor order!	When I contacted Tootsie Pop, they shrugged it off and said that, "they use the highest standards for quality control and flavor mixes". Well I'm not sure what their starting point for quality control standards begins - because if somebody were watching over the mixture process, even a teeny bit more, there would indeed be a MUCH better mixture of flavors in their bulk boxes. I'm thinking that my time with Tootsie Pops has come to an end. With a company such as Tootsie Pops, I expected better - especially for the cost of these big boxes! NOT happy at all with their down trend of quality standards.
1,Get this only if you have an airtight place to keep it. It smells really, really bad... It seemed I could smell it through anything it was in, so I ended up throwing it away. My cats didn't seem interested either- they thought it stunk too.
1,very poor quality and regrettable experience.
1,I was expecting something special.  What I got was dish-soap-flavored honey.  I spent a lot of money for nothing, because there is nothing that could make me eat this or put it in my hot carob or slather my lamb chops with this stuff.  Nasty stuff.		Do yourself a favor.  Buy some nice Tupelo honey.  Won't crystalize and tastes fantastic.
1,Barely taste peppermint. Mostly just sugar syrup.
1,Are you kidding me? This has sugar on it!
1,It is a little bit dryer than another brand I bought at Costco.  I prefer another brand.
1,It is sickeningly sweet and full of chemicals!!!!  It certainly doesn't taste like Cappucino.
1,It is fine but not a good value.
1,Light roast, high in acidity. Does not work well in my gaggia espresso machine with baratza sette grinder. JF DISTRIBUTIONs was the seller and the beans are stale smelling and has poor crema. If I cold return them I would.
1,I was so excited to get these but they turned hard in a matter of days and I was unable to eat them without breaking my teeth!
1,Pieces broken and smashed -- either partially from heat or from improper package. Will not purchase again.
1,I had high hopes for this product.  I had previously used Morton Lite, which is a 50/50 mix of potassium chloride and sodium choride.  I would like to eliminate unnecessary sodium because of my high blood pressure.  This product does help reduce the metalic taste of pure potassium chloride, but unfortunately, it adds an unpleasant "chalky" taste and texture that I find unpleasant.  For me, I would rather use pure potassium chloride.  If I had to salt my food with this stuff, I wouldn't.  Try it and see if you like it.
1,These should be described as "candied" cranberries, not "dried". Sugar level is completely over the top.
1,Bought two different flavors and do not like it. Will not buy again
1,This is my third order of Goji Berries from Amazon.  The first two orders were Amazon's	Healthworks Goji Berries.  They were much better than these.		These berries are smaller, have less residual moisture, and have foreign matter (dirt and small stones) in the bag.  While these berries are less expensive, their lower quality does not merit their purchase.
1,I ordered it to make tea.  It doesn't taste as the chamomile flowers I'm used to.  The flowers were shipped in one big bag; a lot of the flowers were broken into dust-sized pieces.  Will not order again,
1,a little bummed; not really cup for cup.	threw away a big batch of pancakes and a cake because never set up in the middle:(	Leaves things gummy:( I'll stick with the regular bob's gluten free flour mix.	I heard if you cook at lower temp it works better, but then it is not really cup for cup is it?
1,Really loved the sauce, but not the plastic bottle.  You can see when you finish the sauce how it has changed the color of the bottle.  How much plastic must leach into the hot sauce?  If you care about your health, find a different hot sauce to love.  One that comes in a glass bottle.
1,Big regret buying these - they were not like the picture at all - they were wilted and never really perked up.  All the tiny buds towards the top never opened, they just fell off leaving long empty stems.  Also - I got a blood red vase with it that just looked horrible.  Not a pretty and fresh looking clear glass vase.
1,I ordered this tea back in May of 2012 and it was delicious, just what i would expect. I placed an order in July and got something completely different that was undrinkable. Online stores shipped me a replacement for the tea and it was the same horrible tea. I wish i could just find  out who the supplier of the tea shipped in May was...	And I said all that to say that the seller stands by his product. They have credited our account for a full refund..thank you !!
1,GETS WHITE STUFF IN MY COFFEE, ALMOST LIKE THEY ARE SPOILED?
1,Eh . . .
1,Flavors are like candy, with no resemblance to actual fruit flavors. Portions are longer than a foot, though. For kids primarily.
1,Its filled with bad oils (overdose of omega 6) and GMO soy!		Its probably less worse to eat purely whole wheat tortillas		Gave it 2 stars because it tastes "okay"
1,I totally agree with Jeremy Lynnes. This is not the Alpen I grew up with in Scotland, nor is it the same Alpen the Brits are currently eating across the pond. As my cousin so aptly put it, "it tastes like horse food"-meaning it mostly tastes like raw oats. This Canadian version doesn't have much flavor to it at all, and since I stopped eating it, my husband (who likes everything) noted that it seems like all the sugar falls to the bottom of the box, so most of it isn't very sweet, then the last bowlful is too sweet.		If you don't have the original to compare it to, its not very good; comparing it to the original...its very bad. I LOVE Alpen in the UK and brought a box back with me last summer, but this is nothing close...so sad.		Note to Amazon:  Can you please carry the "REAL" Alpen? I promise I'll then write a 5 star review of the product! :)
1,I ordered these expecting them to be like other honey wheat pretzels but they are not.  There is something about the flavor that is not thrilling me but now I have a whole case.  I think I might just donate the rest of the bags.
1,too hard,
1,I love taro flavor for my bubble tea drinks , I was very hopeful about this product initially ,  but disappointed on the taste . I don't think I'll even use the the rest of the bag, which is a waste . Glad I got the smallest size .  I've definitely had better . I'll keep looking and not order this one again .  This tasted strange to me and not a rich taro flavor .
1,These are dry, and hard and leave a terrible bitter after flavor in the mouth.  Yes, yes, I understand they are freeze dried, but seriously they are tooth breaking hard.
1,Writing some reviews for products I bought in 2013... I still have these in the pantry! Clearly I need to toss them! I was doing low carb and thought this would be a great thing to order. I tried them once and never again. There are better options out there, trust me! I suggest trying to find them locally selling individually to try. The thought of these sure sounded good they were just too fake tasting.
1,I made some low carb chocolate truffles. Then I ate a few a day for a few days. It took me that long to realize the headache I was now having was caused by the erythritol. My boyfriend who never gets effected by anything and can take any meds without side-effect, has had the same headache for the time he has been eating them too. Erythritol should come with a surgeon general's warning. I wonder how long it will take for this stinking headache to go away!!!
1,Absolutely tasteless. Don't waste your money.
1,I tried making this product using  two of the methods prescribed on the box, i.e. baking and microwaving. Each time the results were tasteless and horrible.  One more comment: I am no gourmet so a product has to be very bad for me to take the remains, as I shall do here, and dump them where the resident heavily maternal resident opossum can access them.
1,They call these "sticks and twigs" and they really do taste like sticks and twigs. They are crunchy, but they don't have any flavor to speak of, except for some residual heat from the chipotle (don't know where the tomato comes in). And as someone else said, watch out for those hard little bits.
1,These are not like the larger York mints. The chocolate is chalky looking, the candies are not consistently shaped and the filling is chewy on this batch of minis. I think these should have been labeled as seconds, and priced accordingly.
1,1 out of 2 looks like a stepping stone you can get from a hardware store. Very disappointing. Now what do I do?
1,Mixed impressions of this one.  Red Rain, in actuality, in deference to Prince, is really Purple Rain.  Yes, the stuff is actually purple, unlike the more desirable Stacker 2 and Dreamwater colors.  The stuff still works somewhat, I've just not found it as effective as Stacker 2 or Dreamwater.  I also don't know where the Berry Pomegranate taste claim came from.  To me, it's nothing close to it.  I also can't stand the purple color of the stuff.  Apparently no one did customer surveys before going into production, figuring the catchy red bottle with, of all things, a purple cross would do the trick and everyone would forget about the contents.  The purple cross gives it away, but one knows it only after they've used it.  Now, you know it before you use it.  Recommendation:  pass on this, pay a little more and be better off with the Stacker or Dreamwater product.
1,These candies are just too sweet.  I gave away a hole box because I was so disappointed.  The Apple variety are way better.
1,Usually I like Triscuit and and enjoy buying from Amazon at a discounted price. But these particular crackers can occasionally taste somewhat rancid. I'm not sure if its the olive oil that is used or the way it is processed, but I would suggest steering clear of this product.
1,Not very good, not alot of coffee inside the pods. Coffee comes out tasting like you know what.
1,I've tried several Annie Chun's noodle varieties and I must say ALL have been very disappointing.  Based on the overall good reviews (not to mention Amazon's good price), I figured I'd give this Tom Yum soup version a try.  Um yeah, now I'm pondering who among my friends would enjoy this, or rather "wouldn't mind this too much" as I bought a pack of 6, thus 5 more sitting in my pantry giving me the evil eye. Sigh.
1,These did not fit in my Keurig at all, and a lot were damaged when I put them in the Keurig. I would not recommend or buy again.
1,Usually these are yummy and tasty. Unfortunately, the batch that I received was STALE. Kinda icky when stale. I'm bummed, because the vast majority were stale.
1,Very bad flavor. Overwhelmingly sweet.
1,taste chemically
1,Everything was crushed.
1,VERY disappointed in this.  I read the reviews and believed them!  Silly me!  This popcorn was not as good as the PopSecret I usually buy.  I put in 1/3 cup, as directed, and waited.  There were MANY unpopped kernels at the bottom, and MANY that barely popped and were just hard kernels with a tiny bit of popped corn.  I could get better at my grocery store.  A waste of money!  There are so many hard kernels in the popcorn that I was concerned that I'd break my teeth!  I'm throwing this popcorn out!  Yuck!
1,This order is too close to date of expiration and last months order was even newer dates than this order.
1,From $9.64 all the way up to $20.32 is just ridiculous! For six 1.3 ounce cups( 7.8oz total ), that's $2.56 an ounce! This is the 4th. Dr McDougall's  product that I have dropped from my Amazon scheduled purchase because of DM's ridiculous pricing policies. It was a good product, convenient and reasonably priced but, there are many others now on Amazon just as good or better for less money.  I can make approximately the same thing at home from scratch for much,much less..UPDATE 01/16: orriginal  review was over a year ago, since then the price went down to $11.34  now it's back up to $21.44! Not quite 100%. I used to Subscribe & Save for 7 different Dr. McDougall's, now I'm down to one ( until they raise it, then I'll drop it.)
1,ordered "C+H, Cane Sugar, Golden Brown, 2lb (Pack of 2)". mainly to try on pork as part of a dry rub; instead of the resealable package(s) as noted I received one gray generic package mainly identified with a magic marker "X" (another magic marker mark covered over) and not resealable; haven't even opened it yet, the product could be anything, from anybody, or it could be useable but need repackaging to save the remainder after first use; and did it mean two one pound packages or two two pound packages (4 lbs) which is what the price would indicate; not very happy with Amazon about this!
1,What happened to this? It USED to be so good-now it is bland and tasteless-and not worth $20.00+!	I add lots of salt and some red pepper spice blend, and could barely choke it down!
1,Not sure if it was a bad batch but didn't taste fresh. I have another on order due to price being better than costco. If its not good... will update and not order again.
1,I shared this box of organic chocolate with my family, and not one of us liked it at all.  Each of us felt it left an odd taste in your mouth, and that goes for all different flavors.  The milk chocolate almost tasted like dark, the milk chocolate with almonds was the worst of them all, in my opinion.  My husband thought the ginger flavored chocolate was the worst.  My daughter tried the milk chocolate and she only took a few chews before she deposited it in the garbage.		I cannot give this more than 2 stars, unfortunately.  We were excited to try it, and were very disappointed.
1,I love the ingredients in these taco shells, and I love the taste. But this is the 2nd case we've ordered in which the shells themselves flop closed when warmed (according to package directions) in the oven.		My husband and I can make it work as tostada shells, but I have young children who are emphatically disgruntled by the shape of their taco. So, we won't order again.
1,These were nasty, they were so greasy and too rich for my blood, plus they lacked major flavor, no spicy jalapeno flavor at all.  I was so dissapointed in these chips, I am always hearing great things about these chips but I am telling you, yuck yuck yuck.  Give me pain chips any day.  Maybe there is a better kettle chip brand out there but I am staying clear from these chips. I wish I could give these zero stars if I could.
1,The promised delivery did not come on time.  Was too disappointing.
1,Smelled good opening the bag.  After brewing, another swing and miss for Coffee Masters.  I am done with them.
1,I was excited to buy this, I was looking forward to some crackers and "cream cheese" but my first bite left me very disappointed. Horrible non cheese taste, gummy texture.		My first dairy free "cream cheese" was the better then cream cheese kind, which was delicious. I won't be messing with a good thing because it is very close to the real thing!		Sorry Daiya, wanted to like this but not even close! Sorry!
1,Why can't we find a gelatin without poison aspartame in it?!?
1,I thought I finally had my sugar substitute but after using an entire bag thinking my digestive system would eventually get used to it, never did...  Every time I use even a small amount (teaspoon) I get gas pains, bloating and diarrhea and end up taking a bunch of probiotics to straighten my gut back into shape.		It sure does taste good without any aftertaste, but for me, it's not worth it.  I'd be curious if others have been able to rid their digestive issues and continue using the product..  I'd love to add this to my grocery list.
1,I have drank this coffee for yrs, but this stuff tastes awful.
1,Overpriced. I can't wait for Sodastream to start selling this again.
1,I order Miracle Noodles, and they sent me an advertising email blast recommending this lemonade. I bought into the hype after reading these 5 star reviews... and I am BOGGLED why this is getting these 5 star ratings. I was really excited about trying this... sounded too good to be true. And it is.		This tastes like mild lemony water with some odd, vaguely chemical or herbal (bad Stevia) aftertaste that is almost like morning breath. I can't exactly explain it... reminds me of saccharin except its more rotting organic, similar to when spinach or kale goes bad... maybe I have a bad batch.		Anyone one of you 5-star raters want this case? I will send it for the shipping cost - includes all but 1 box.,, its still 99% wrapped.
1,Me and my husband tried to drink this coffee to have the lower acid to our coffee. Neither one of us liked it.  The taste is horrible to us.
1,The first time I tried these wraps I put scrambled eggs and cheese in them for breakfast. I couldn't get past the strong coconut flavor mixed with egg. It just wasn't a good flavor combo for me and I was turned off. Maybe they would be better with a chicken/tuna salad or with fruit somehow?  An upside is they didn't tear or fall apart easily.
1,Last about 5 minutes and can't blow a big bubble with it. Nothing like bazooka gum. Just ordered Bazooka for myself. Bringing this gum to Havana, Cuba where they don't know of quality gum. Sorry.
1,Very bitter aftertaste. Would not buy again. Gave the entire box away.
1,At first I thought maybe the banana in my shake was too green and that's what gave it the sour taste.  Then the next shake was bad too.  Then I made some brownies that tasted awful.  I realized it was this cocoa.  It has a very strange taste.  I'm an experienced baker and have used probably 5 different brands of organic cocoa and I've never run into this issue.  That's too bad, I was really excited about trying this.  There's also no option to return it.
1,Eh... Don't care for the flavor and didn't notice the caffeine
1,I was really hoping for a true "Jerk Sauce" since I have been to Jamaica and had the real thing.  The initial taste straight from the bottle is okay.  But the 1st ingredient is Soy sauce so after marinating anything it has an overwhelming taste of soy sauce.  Also it has a lot of salt in it as well that I don't care for.  In the end the sauce is only okay IMO and I will not but buying this again.
1,It's my fault that I ordered them a second time. I should have remembered that I didn't like them the first tme i tried them. They're small and flinty and almost completely flavorless. Maybe I'll try re-roasting some to see if that will help. They truly have almost no flavor at all; empty calories.	A big disappointment; especially the accidental second time around.
1,These bars are way too sweet and sugary.  I found the coating/glaze present on the bottom half of each bar overpowering, unpleasant, and on the verge of being nauseating.  Do not be fooled, these bars are anything but healthy. I ended up giving most of them away. I was looking for a bar with mostly nuts, not a sickeningly sweet sugar bar. One might as well just eat spoonfuls of sugar and skip the bar altogether. Boy, was I ever disappointed!
1,I don't have anything to compare this couscous to since this is my first time trying couscous. I didn't care for the texture or the flavor. I also found a number of bugs in the raw couscous. I realize FDA allows a certain amount in grains but seemed more prevalent than with other grains I've had in the past. I will not be reordering again.
1,I had to throw these away I just couldn't take the burn carob taste, save your money find something else. They are individually wrapped and stay fresh but hard to get past having to need something else to take away the after taste.
1,Expected stronger lemon flavor so have to use a lot to really taste the lemon.  Not terrible but pretty mediocre...
1,Not that great. Certainly not worth the cost. To be honest, the recipe on the back of a bag of tollhouse chocolate chips makes a far better, far fresher cookie.  I wouldn't waste my money on these.
1,Disappointed.... this is not a concentrate or powder you add water to. This is a ready to serve liquid, only 2 small servings (8 oz ea). The taste is very bland and almost tasteless.
1,I wish I had taken the time to check review of this product; I would have saved myself some money  It is AWFUL!  It has a nasty burned taste and the texture is so fake...well, we just couldn't eat it.  I don't know why Amazon is selling such an inferior product; the price should have tipped me off.  At least I didn't pay shipping; that would have added insult to injury!
1,I would not use this product!!		And take it from someone that uses stevia as the only sweetener. Has a horrible after taste that I cannot tolerate. Sorry, I really wanted to like this product :(
1,I like this brand b/c it uses stevia and the ingredients seem a bit more natural than others out there, plus a reasonable price. I've tried the strawberry and vanilla-praline flavors; both were great and are worth buying again. I can't believe such a classic/basic flavor, this french vanilla, was such a let down. Upon opening the canister, it doesnt really smell like vanilla. The smell reminded me of... sweetened baby powder-birthday cake-musty baby formula-my mom's face powder puff (LOL)?? Very powder-y scent, is the best i can describe it. And it tastes that way too. (The texture, dissolvability, and sweetness level are fine though.) Vanilla is a pretty simple flavor to make decent-tasting in my opinion, but this version has failed. I would not recommend, and will not be purchasing again.
1,you poor gluten free folks ... many of you rated this product highly ... i'm so sorry that this is one of the best products available.  texture is very  much like melba toast.  but i cant figure out how parmesan and garlic bagel has a 'sweet' taste.  too much of something.  and poorly packaged at the manufacturer.  more than half of all six boxes were crumbs and broken.  probably all these will be good for is bread crumbs.
1,could not eat
1,This coconut oil was all clumpy when I received it and it had melted and hard chunks in it. I was hoping this was truly the pure extra virgin coconut oil but it's not. Look else where for something better. Also it has MCT in it which I think screws it all up.
1,It gives you the look of foam and some added flavor. However! This stuff smells like mold/mildew and sour. I added this to iced chai @ work and it looked authentic. It says refrigeration is not needed. I was smelling something horrid but I couldn't figure out what until I opened the lid ewww. Thought refrigeration may fix it so I placed a fresh bottle in the fridge @ home and still that smell was present. I am going back to vigorously shaking my milk or using a foamer.
1,Stevia gives me a headache - it also leaves an after-taste
1,OVERPRICED !!!!!!
1,I do not see the seal of US Certified Organic.  So, I decided not to purchase.  I cannot see the proof of its claim to be organic. It seems it is over-stated or falsely stated in the name.
1,Seems that a lot of the flavor must be in the oil. Mixed with water leaves a bland frosting like paste. Prefer the chocolate	but...	 won't be buying this again.
1,This was by far the worst pop corn I have ever had. I was hoping, because of the price it would be great. I was wrong. The kernels where small and hard. I tried another bag and it too was disappointing. The favor packet was OK and I didn't use the oil packet.
1,I had heard such great things about Pukka tea, and the reviews for this Relax tea were excellent - I'm so disappointed with the flavor - no matter whether I steep the teabag for 5 seconds of 5 minutes, the flavor is very just not good.  It's weak, which isn't necessarily a bad thing - but it's just the most offputting flavor.... can't even describe it - it's slightly bitter, background flavor of aniseed (which is OK) - but it just does NOT taste good.  It has absolutely no effect on relaxing me, or making me sleeping, or helping me drift off - it's the most pointless tea I've ever had.  I struggle to finish my cup - and will revert to the trusty Tazo chamomile tea, which has always been excellent.  I won't order Pukka again.  Just thought I wanted to try something different - never again.  I have used about 3 teabags and don't know what to do with the rest, I'll never use them.
1,Not nearly dark enough - much too weak		I have to say I had HOPE that this would be something good, but am sure I will continue to be disappointed in the blend. I guess it just isn't quite mature enough to have anything of substance behind it. The ONE thing I especially didn't like is that I had to pay for it in the first place. I mean, after all, doesn't the constitution guarantee me free coffee (and everything else)? Well, I certainly think that those rich folks on the hill should SPREAD THE WEALTH and buy me some of this stuff.
1,MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU, BUT REALLY DOESN'T HAVE MUCH TASTE.  I'M EATING THEM.  NOT SOMETHING I'LL EVER ORDER AGAIN.
1,All melted, could not enjoy it.
1,Too hard to open
1,This was a huge disappointment and now I understand why the picture was "blurry" for the Nutrition Facts.  This is basically "sugar water" with artificial and natural flavor and FD&C Red #40 (Allura Red).  The food coloring is synthetically processed from petroleum, although commonly used in the US and approved by the Food and Drug Administration.  For me, not even going to open this bottle and will be in the trash tomorrow.  There's more sugar in the product than there is water.
1,I did not care for this caviar and also thought that it was expensive for what it is
1,expensive for the level of quality...
1,I was not going to review this tea because I figured the people who gave it 5 stars must have received a better quality control batch than I did. But every time I make a pot I am reminded of how much I dislike it. It is basically tasteless, and you will never find anything that looks like a leaf in it. It is all powder.	I did notice that a few other reviewers had the same experience, so I just thought I would relate my experience.
1,2 bags of the rice and angel hair were unusable, dried out and stuck together...I think they were OLD...preceding order had probs too, but I reordered cause prior to that everything was fine....	this is too expensive to lose even 1 bag, let alone 3!...
1,Fruit or cinnamon flavor is better choice.
1,Based on some of the other reviews that I had read, I bought this to try and get away from nondairy creamer that we use in our coffee when we travel. Upon first taste, we thought it was rancid. However, we finally concluded that it wasn't, but that it tastes cultured & slightly salted, like sour cream. Definitely not a flavor you want in your coffee. Oh, well.
1,I got these for my Starbucks Verismo machine. They do fit. But they get stuck. And it's just the CBTL decaf pods. The other CBTL pods work, namely the regular pods, chai pods. But decaf gets stuck.
1,Taste more like Moroccan sardines which sell from $1-$2/can, vs.this  several times as expensive.		In the past this brand has been excellent, rated some places as best sardines, and Portuguese sardines are reputed best or near best.		This batch much like the inferior taste of Moroccan sardines which as mentioned can be purchased for. $1-$2/can. So this is not value for your money.
1,Do these raving reviewers actually ever eat Indian food made by Indians at an Indian restaurant? Cause Matar Paneer is one of my favorite foods at an Indian Restaurant --and I often order the chick peas as well--and this doesn't compare. I have bought this twice, hoping I was remembering wrong, but I wasn't. This is not very good. The rice is passable. The entrees just not very good. The sauce is offputting, not the wonderful aroma or flavor one would expect for this.		Frozen food can taste good. Amy's has other nice entrees that I often buy. This is not one of them. If you love Indian food, I recommend you stay away. This is just off.
1,This is a very small jar of pickles and very expensive for what you receive.		Save your money and buy a larger jar of Vlasic Pickles, Kosher Dills made with sea salt.  Cut up two habaneros and let sit for about two weeks.  You get the same flavor and head, larger jar and save $10.00.		Sorry Texas Hill, this are WAY over priced for what you receive.
1,Sorry guys, but this stuffing did not exceed our expectations.  First of all, I did follow instructions how to make it, and it was crunchy.  The color was an unpleasant green shade, and fragrance of it was not very good.  My husband and I tried a little with Thanksgiving dinner, but was not to our liking. I ended up dumping the rest as my son absolutely refused to try it.  My daughter did try it, but spit it out.  Guess I will try homemade gluten free stuffing on my own from scratch.
1,What can i say, I love iced tea. I drink a lot of it, and love the convenience of these new individual serving size packets. I am also a big fan of Stash products, or rather of all the other stash products I have tried.	I purchased a case of all 4 varieties,  (when i say i drink iced tea, i am not kidding) and these were all way too weak when i mixed them in my 16 ounces water bottle.	I finally found that i needed to dissolve 2 packets in a small bit of hot water first (if not the tea clumped on me), and than add a packet of sweetener before adding the rest of the water just to make these palatable.	Over all I am very dissatisfied with the product and will stick with the other brands that are out on the market.
1,Tin was crushed and chocolate was half gone. This is such great chocolate I am very disappointed.
