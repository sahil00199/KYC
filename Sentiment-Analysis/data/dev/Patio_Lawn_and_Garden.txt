0,Alkalinity, ph levels, acid demand and chlorine/bromine readings.  Everything you need to keep up with your pool's chemistry.  Use it and save on chlorine costs.
0,The sheer size is perfect for our kitchen scraps. The filter on top does keep the smells at bay. The only negative I have is the seal on the lid. The lid should have been made of a more sturdy material to keep it sealed better. The fruit flies and knats are really bad around and inside the collector.
0,I purchased this item, and the 17" stand alone thermometer model.  I knew nothing about barometers.  I knew nothing about Galileo thermometers.  I use this model in my living room.		The weather glass does indeed respond to pressure changes, and does a nice job of predicting foul weather.  The thermometer is accurate, easy to read (and interpolate).  It only works in a range of 64 thru 80 degrees F, but anything above or below those readings is likely to require I do something with the heating and cooling around my house, so it tells me what I need to know.		I think this is a great gift for kids interested in science.  I have other weather glasses too, but this one comes in combination with a neat, accurate thermometer.  I'm not a kid anymore, but I find it fun, as well as useful, myself.
0,Very happy with this heater. It was 65 degrees yesterday and snowing today. There was no cracking with the abrupt temperature shift. The birds love it. I saw a squirrel drink from it too.
0,Was shipped fast and is real easy to install and set up.
0,These work nice. They even catch  spiders.
0,Best option for refrigerator drain hose on camper to keep bugs out while allowing condensate to clear.
0,I can't tell you how many times I've replaced the plastic flag poles you find at the stores because they crack.  I used one of the metal ones that usually comes with flag kits and it folded like a cheap piece of garbage in less than a week.  I got this bracket and it is strong.  I love it.  I messed up and got it a little too large but it is holding my smaller flag pole just fine.  So far it has withstood a pretty strong storm.  So glad I found this.
0,so far i haven't seen and deer or rabbits hope this stops what ever is chewing up my garden i guess time will tell
0,I bought this knife on impulse. I had no idea what a Hori Hori knife was. I was looking for a slim trowel for planting bulbs. I broke my trowel digging holes and hacking off small roots and weeds. This knife seemed better suited to those tasks so I gave it a try. It appears strong and well made. It should hold up better for tough garden jobs. There is a trowel-like curve to the blade so it works well as a slim trowel that also cuts. It's winter here, so other than going out and digging some quick holes, I haven't put it to full use. However, I am impressed with the quality vs low cost and this will work great for me. The sheath is junk as others mentioned. If I keep the knife sharp, it will end up cutting the sheath right open the first time I am not careful. Not planning on wearing this thing though.	For those that do not have knife sharpening tools, a chain saw file should work fine to sharpen this, especially the serrated side.
0,Works Great!
0,Worked perfect to replace the recoil starter on a Billy Goat Lawn Vac
0,No more ANTS!!!!  I put it down a directed, the next day ALL THE ANTS WERE GONE haven't seen them since and that wa more than a month ago!!!
0,These sell for $5 each at my local mower shop. They are great quality and the price is amazing. Worth every penny.
0,Really REALLY sturdy. Holds a full hummingbird feeder without any fear whatsoever.
0,Wanted a solar fountain for the soon to arrive hummingbirds. The spray was somewhat too high & drained the birdbath. After a few modifications it's perfect.
0,We have an old pew where this cushion sits. The colors match the other cushions on the Adirondack chairs on our deck! We really like it!
0,Works Just fine
0,used this to start roots on ti-leaf cuttings.  must work somehow cause i noticed multiple new shoots coming out of the branch cuttings i planted!  looking to try other cuttings to see if it works as well.
0,Grill was a bit larger than expected, but appears well built. I purchased it to use with my travel trailer and the propane system on it. The grill is made to use the small camping propane tanks, I modified it to work with my travel trailers' built in quick-connect propane outlet. This required removing the grills regulator and adding a propane quick-connect in it's place. Fairly straight forward and easy to do. Since the trailers' propane is already regulated you do not need the regulator on the grill. I also purchased a ten foot propane quick-connect extension hose to connect the grill to the trailer.  Look forward to using it soon
0,nice product
0,its a shovel, does what its supposed to, and the price is right.
0,Bought these, loved the price and the quality is great. They combine a pair. I ordered 3 more pairs.
0,Its powdered rocks, what else should I say about it?  These rocks are defiantly powder!
0,I love this product and so do my plants!  I've been using it for years on everything!
0,I originally purchased a tiny table cover in this brand and had to return.  This size fits easily over my round table and 4 chairs.  It has vents, an elastic drawstring on the bottom, and clips like you find on life jackets to hold on in high winds. I am using on a covered porch to protect my cushions from critters and the neighbor's cats. It is a thick canvas material.
0,Blower shows lots of wear. Missing a part but company shipped replacement in one day. Starts and runs well. Lots of power in blowing mode...have not tried vac mode. Good value.
0,Perfect and exactly what I wanted and very fast shipping. Thank you
0,Nice, but Mfr's packaging is so poor that hardware got lost, corners got exposed & discolored during transport.  Gotta buy replacement nuts & spray paint it.  Not too happy about it.
0,Exactly as described, a product that I can depend on and use to its fullest capability.  I know where to look if I need another.
0,If you garden, this is a great additive! Helps your plants uptake soil nutrients, concentrated so doesn't take much!
0,I have an indoor plumeria that never bloomed until I tried this product.  I used it according to the plumeria seller's recommendation, and it has been continually blooming for 9 months.
0,birds like it
0,I think I like it.  We had to wire it to our metal deck railing, and I'm not sure how I'm going to empty it.  I will take it inside in winter since we live in the high foothills west of Denveer.
0,works great
0,Great quality flag.
0,Best axe I have ever used. Never will I use a splitting maul again. Light weight but the design splits right through wood. To show my friends how great this axe is I even use it one handed. I split fir and lodgepole for firewood, my only source of heat in Montana.
0,Working all the time
0,Bought to replace a deteriorated fuel tank bushing on a John Deere LX277 riding mower.  Perfect fitting replacement for the OEM bushing.
0,I bought this brush to clean AC coils. It worked fantastic. Easiest thing I have ever used. Just use it very easily. No bent fins...
0,got it to try it, esp for high value area...  hasn't caught anything yet, mostly due to season, other traps working, and less mice overall...		i am hoping it can get the nasties in the Spring, in volume, when they start that cycle again
0,Really nice.  Thick glass makes them not too fragile.  Well made and quite serviceable.
0,Worked for us, along with cheese. Used it with "Rat Zapper Classic RZC001" electronic trap.
0,Great buy
0,Gets the job done
0,I was so surprised at the quality of the pillow covers, because of the price. They look great on my patio chairs.
0,Well made grill cover at a great price... Surprise...... grill brush and gloves included!!!!
0,thought I had outsmarted the squirrels, but they have figured out how to unlatch and sit inside and eat.
0,Man, these traps really work.  I have had to replace all of them after only a month as they were just too full of spiders and other bugs that I didn't want in the house and garage.
0,great product
0,Kills roaches, and last forever.
0,This seed is very clean. The finches love it.
0,Looks amazing on our old cedar tree!
0,The bag fabric is more like the Polaris "sand and silt" bag as opposed to the "all purpose bag" (heavier mesh) but it is still a very good value for the price. I've been in the industry for almost 20 years and these units cost me LESS than 1/2 the price of the OEM bags I have been buying at the wholesaler.
0,The ET Pest Control from DNR Tech arrived safely, smoothly and on time.		This device is very easy to setup and comes with instructions. I live in Florida and we have all kind of bugs all year around.	I did not buy this unit for bats, rats or mice because we never had them in our houses. Snakes are probably taking care of rats and mice for us. I bought the Pest Control for roaches, ants, mosquitoes, spiders, silverfish and flies.		I plugged it in an outlet next to the kitchen and the lights came on. I pressed the test button and heard the terrible sound that is suppose to keep bugs out of the house. If you don`t press the test button you don`t hear anything and the device doesn`t bother you. It has a low and high setting and I put it on high because it is a two story home with more than 2500 square ft. The device is suppose to cover up to 5000 square ft.	It has a little night light at the bottom which I find a great idea. So far the device seems to work and we find less and less bugs in the house. If it continues working this will be a great money saver because I would have to pay more for a one time chemical spraying of my house with a pest control service than this device costs. Not only may it be cheaper it is definitely safer than chemicals.		For a little under $50, I rate this Pest Control device five out of five stars.	I am thrilled I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review. Opinions are my own and I did not get paid for this review. This is a product I would recommend!
0,Very thin silicone blade will make short work of not just omelet's, but bread dough, cake batter, and frosting. Hoping for the best on durability.
0,I was worried about getting a short one, but this serves my need just fine, as it accompanied by a longer and more troublesome one.  I leave the sprinkler on it instead of switching heads - so much easier.  slightly stiff to lay out, but if it weren't, I am sure it would kink.  I got it with the gilmore brass 2-way hose connector - an excellent pair for me
0,As advertised, exact replacement at a fraction of the OEM cost.  Shipped on time, installed and operates perfectly.  Very pleased with this purchase experience.
0,I mean spa store. Look, I don't have anything against someone making a buck, and selling accessories is high margin stuff. But when the local shop is charging twice as much for the same exact product, they are just taking advantage of people. This filter is the same dimensions, and probably made in the same factory under a couple of different names, but really, it's just a hot tub filter. Nothing fancy. Amazon has a great price on it, shipped quickly as usual, and was half the price- way to go!!
0,I like the extra mesh on the end.  This give flexibility for the length of the tunnel and easy access to water the plants.  I ordered more.
0,Must have do-hicky to convert one end of a stainless steel washer hose to use outside as a faucet extender.  We use Nelson brass connectors exclusively since they are the BEST quality and trouble free.  Don't be fooled by imitations which are light weight and flimsy.
0,Well made should last for years to come
0,Is good product but bottles of cal solutions far too large. You would have to have 4 or 5 meters to use before expiration date. Otherwise it a quality product.
0,Using is now to grow seeds I've had waiting.  Love it  So easy
0,I placed this inside my cats bowl and ran a little tube. Cats feel like they are drinking out of the faucet! They can't get enough!
0,Beautiful color and great color
0,Much stronger than the cheap ones I'd been using.  I use these to hold down a bunch of paper bag type Christmas lights along our driveway and they penetrate the gravel pretty well.
0,These 3 plants arrived this week in fairly good condition. I planted them, and they seem to be doing well today. They are perfect for my fairy garden.
0,I've used Terro products before and they work awesomely...my house tend to become summer camp for spiders and I hate all bugs especially spiders...I spray it all over my house and the next day I see them belly up...it does say it works for 12 months but as soon as I see one creeping back I spray again...twice a year seems to suffice... definitely my go to pest control...
0,Hard to tell by the pictures alone how large this brush is, but it is large.  It works great - the bristles seem to be holding up very well, and while it flexes a bit with pressure it is stiff enough to do a good job scouring.
0,Nice product fast and delivered as described. Would use again.
0,Bright lights great window decorative items
0,This nozzle allows for 'softer' spray of water on plants.  It provides a pattern other than the normal round head pattern.  The flow control gives you more control right at the site of the task.  I also have used it to water new grass seed without moving/disturbing the seed.	4 stars instead of 5 because I don't know how long it will last (flow control is plastic).
0,I purchased this screen almost nine years ago through another seller, as Amazon did not have at that time. I placed this around an unsightly AC unit right outside the master bedroom in my parents backyard. Yes it's hollow on one side, but most screens are one-sided blocking something ugly. Otherwise you'd be installing a fence, or a wall, building an enclosure, putting up a shed for 360 degree coverage.		Two years later I proceeded to re-landscape the entire yard but that screen stayed. It has held up perfectly to the California sun and the heat radiating from unit. Simply hose off occasionally and it's sparkling white again.		Recommended and several neighbors installed in their yards for AC, pool equipment, and trash cans. I am purchasing again for new house in new state.
0,Perfect fit!
0,Simple way to keep track of how much propane is left!
0,Expensive for the amount you get, tons of seeds in wth it= lots of weeding
0,works well sturdy nice design
0,Great little blower  for  the  price.
0,just as described. Works as it should.
0,While these were advertised for rattan furniture, I am using them on metal frames.  The bottom corners of the covers have velcro that wraps around the legs of the chairs to keep it on - which in California is good when it is windy!  The soft lining is protective of the chairs, and the outside seems waterproof.  A good find - the covers I had been using had dried out and were pretty much unusable - it is wonderful to hunt on Amazon and find what I want!  And then get them quickly.
0,Was looking for a way to easily and efficiently kill the occasional flying insect that got into home...especially wanted a way to kill mosquitoes.		This works excellently!		If a mosquito flies in when door is opened, I grab this and within a minute or two have been able to kill it.		I am very pleased.  This is an effective insect killing device which solved the problem...it's clean, efficient, effective.
0,Excellent Seller. A+++
0,Great light. Quality construction. I have several different set ups with different types of lighting. I want to do some sort of 'comparison' between them as to how plants perform at some point, but my favorite part about this particular fixture is the great light you can SEE by. The LED's that have the strong colors make it hard to actually see your plants while they are on, and if they are off you have to have a different light source available. With this light I can see the plants very closely, and if I wasn't using it for plants I would use it as a general work light for crafts, etc. Light is very true daylight.
0,This stuff really works. Regular weekly applications solved out tomato plant disease problem. A bit pricey, but worth it.
0,good
0,This held up well for three years in moderate weather and direct sunlight. Eventually discolored to yellow and started developing cracks, so I ordered a replacement unit today.
0,This electric blower is perfect for my needs. I use it to blow leaves off the patio and deck and it works perfectly for that. It's not powerful enough to use on wet leaves in the yard but that's not what I intended it for.  I am very pleased with it
0,Excellent! AUTHENTIC Latin fragrances and flavors.... Great job, keep up the good work, guys.  :+)!
0,Great for those pesky flies/mosquitoes!  Leaves a very satisfying "zap" whenever one crosses the electric strings.  Highly recommend!
0,I bought this with the planter and it fits well yet is light but not flimsy. I recommend it for the 30" planter.
0,These pots are hard to find locally.	Repotted my orchids and they are doing fine.
0,This stuff rocks!  A much noticed improvement in yield and quality since I started using.
0,These don't do much but cover the burner pipes and send drippings back as smoke.  They do it very well.  These replaced a set that I used for over 10 years.
0,Works really good on my rose bushes.  Have used it several years now.
0,works great
0,Very good smoker
0,I bought several plants from Hirt's. They were surprisingly small and weak, particularly when compared to Logee's, the greenhouse that I usually ordered from, although their prices were lower. The Jasmines actually were the healthiest of the lot and flowered within a month, before some of the other plants even grew a new leaf. Judging from the other reviews, I might have been lucky.		Jasmines grow easily indoors and are resistant to pests and fungi. The flowers are simply heavenly. They are perfect plants for windowsills.
0,substantial, strong and very beautiful globes do exactly what the ads say they do.  How wonderful not to have to water my plants all the time!
0,Typical filter medium. Cut to the size needed
0,He's definitely what my gnome garden needed!
0,This "Deer Off" deer, rabbit, and squirrel repellent works well to keep squirrels away from my shed. We don't keep much of a garden and don't mind the deer that come into our yard, but have a fairly serious issue with squirrels getting into my shed and eating our plastic gas cans (seriously annoying).		This is a natural and non-toxic (to the animals) way to deter the critters without hurting them. We apply this around the outside and on the roof after each rain and it has kept our squirrel damage way down.		Recommended!		CFH
0,Love it.. well built, cleans awesome with little effort. Will buy again.
0,This is a good muffler. Not sure it's quieter but it works good.
0,Great Invention and works when I am away for extended periods of time!
0,As advertised. performs as advertised, very powerful and easy to set up and operate.  Highly recommend to anyone interested in buying a pressure washer..
0,We've had a number of grill covers over the years, and this one is the best yet.  Very thick, heavy material.  Top notch product...you will not be disappointed.
0,This is such a neat little seat.  I'm not exactly a "Gardener", however I am a smoker and so I like to sit outside a lot when I'm smoking.  This is a perfect little seat for your garden, or wherever else you may require a nice little bench outside.  It also would make a nice little stool for your bedroom to sit and put your shoes on, if you don't have a lot of space for something larger.		You can use the bench is either a sitting bench or if you turn it over you can use it to kneal in your garden to plant flowers, etc. It also can be folded up for storage.  There is a little pouch on the side for placing your tools and such inside.		It seems to be fairly sturdy!  I was really shocked by how sturdy it was.  I love the green color.		Overall, I'm extremely impressed.  Although, I am admittedly no expert on gardening and the tools one might need and use for gardening.  As for testing it on the qualities as a seat, I really do like it and we actually use it everyday.		** Sample Provided for Testing & Review
0,This is my third or fourth review on the east they work great easy couple quick connect as advertised I have to give this product five star rating the reason for that is it works
0,Very nice skimmer - large and easy to clean. Well designed float assembly lifts out with basket. It requires a good amount of flow to keep the water flowing over the float, the filter must be kept thoroughly clean. I have the 12' x 36" EasySet soft sided pool, and the included adapters fit the thread for the original strainer that came with the pool. Amazing how much crud winds up in there after only a few hours. The float keeps debris in the basket even if the filter shuts off, as when used with a daily timer.
0,fast shipping - item as described. thanks!!
0,So, we purchased this for one reason only: spiders.  We don't really have a problem with mice or other things in the house.  However, we do get some spiders in our son's room and they bother him.  However, we didn't want to just kill spiders we saw, as we do know they're actually beneficial to have around.  This seemed like the perfect thing to both keep spiders away from his room (particularly his desk and bed), while not just killing them.  And after giving it a couple weeks, it does seem to actually work.  He says he hasn't seen any spiders in his room lately.		It's also a night light, which isn't bad.  And it does have a port on the side of the unit for a plug so it's not completely taking up one of the outlets in the room.  That's good, as again, it's near his desk and he needs the power outlets there.  There's only one thing I'd call a negative though, and that's the ultrasonic part of the unit.  If you're somewhat close to it, you can hear a very faint little "tick" sound when it kicks in.  I'm assuming this is just a part of the function and not a defect that we can actually hear it trigger.  But it's not loud, and barely audible.  I just felt it was at least worth mentioning.		Overall, it does seem to deter spiders.  So I'd say it's worth giving a shot if you want to keep them out of your kids' rooms (or wherever they might be bothering you).
0,awesome product
0,I got tired of using plastic ones. They kept breaking, so I decided to switch to brass. Jury still out. It does need good water pressure to perform as required. I have a well and the water pressure is not as high as city provided water pressure, so this item is not performing as well as I would like it to, not the mfg. problem though. So, if your water pressure is around 35 psi or less, this sprinkler head may not work well for you.
0,These are the best mole traps that I have found.  I now have five of them as the moles were a big problem this year.  I wish there was a perfect trap but I haven't found that yet.
0,These work great for indirect grilling. I filled my chimney starter and I was able to get all of the briquets in although I had to place a few that spilled over using tongs. But they definitely work keeping the main heat on the edges but still plenty of heat to grill with - could even be a bit too much depending on what you are cooking. Easier to cleanup, too.
0,Great garden clippers
0,Love these snips.  I have had one for over a year and just bought another pair.
0,Excellent staples to hold drip irrigation or yard lights. Easy to use and will stay in place once inserted. Best to insert at an angle for better grip with soil. I had purchased 4" staples locally and they did not hold at all so returned them.  These at 6" work perfectly. Quality seems good. Fair price. They will  rust over time but I don't see that as an issue. The only other option is galvanized staples which are more expensive and may not grip as well and perhaps will also rust over time. Highly recommend.
0,So far so good. This makes starting all my seedling so easy!
0,Direct replacement for 798674 carburetor on MTD 21" mower with B&S 500e 140cc engine. The mower would start with original carb, but quickly die indicating a fuel problem. After taking the old apart, cleaning and putting it back was still no go. Saw this one for $24 and although it had a different part number, it looked identical so I took a chance.  Took about 5 minutes to pull the old one and install the new. Note that this carb has no throttle linkage as it is a basic single speed.  There is a linkage for the automatic choke. Hardly worth the trouble of cleaning a carburetor if you can buy one so cheaply.
0,Five star product
0,Love them, they look real nice, plan to us clear outdoor spray paint on them so they won't be effected by the weather as bad. Even the solar ones can be done this way and make them last good longer.
0,If you have lots of tough weeds to hack through this line will do what you want. I put this on my Stihl weedeater and have had it last much longer than the string that they sell.
0,Ants kept coming for weeks.  Then no more ants.  Been using this product for years and it does the job.  But you have to be patient and let it do its work. Keep adding fresh TORRO.
0,Did the job where another started leaking almost immediately
0,Amazing product, will definitely use again, as long as they don't raise the price.
0,as expected
0,I received  my valve in time and in good condition. It was the correct size and type I ordered. I'm sorry that the other person's order wasn't correct.
0,Very good quality and worked very well
0,great product
0,The Gilmore 10 Series 75 ft hose is of high quality material.  It's a little on the heavy side, but seems to be very well made.  Because of its length and heavy duty construction it does take some effort to pull it around.  I have one of those lightweight 50 ft "as seen on TV pocket hoses" and the Gilmore is certainly a real hose that will hold up over time unlike the "pocket hose".  This product is actually less per foot and will outperform and last years longer than any other of the many hoses I've ever purchased.
0,After reading so many reviews, I thought this was really gonna be a project. Lets face it, we all have a different skillset. I must have gotten a diffferent set of instructions, mine were very straight forward until the end. The door assembly and lock were a little muddled. When I read thru the booklet I thought...that's it? I just put a workbench together that had more screws. Oh, there was some swearing alright. I no sooner got started and the wind kicked up (not in the forecast). I built the shed by myself...I just used a ladder and a lawn chair to steady the panels until I got them tied together. I took several breaks and still finished in under 6 hours. I'm sure if  I had a helper to hold the panels and hand me screws I could have done it in four. I have built several sheds, this was the easiest of the metal ones. Meaning.....the plastic ones are even easier.
0,Came in a timely manner, super is exactly as advertised.
0,Its on my chicken coop and everyone notices it and says something about it. Yes it serves no purpose buy it looks really nice and is made really well. I did not like the way its supposed to fasten so I drilled a couple of holes in it and screwed it down.
0,Very sweet piece.  We bought this stone to use as a grave marker for our sweet cat of 18 years that recently passed away.
0,Apple chips have been my wood of choice for smoking.  Consistent chip size.  Chip size works great in my masterbuilt electric smoker
0,perfect
0,I love love love this thing, in fact I like it so much I bought 3 more of them	it disappears from view but strong/ sturdy enough to hold 150ft black and decker all weather hose (very heavy hose)
0,Works like a charm on my hummingbird feeders.
0,Flag is flown with pride from my flag pole. Good quality.

0,If you have an aerogarden and don't like the plant selections they sell, you need something like this. Getting plant seeds into the hole isn't the most fun thing I've ever done, but that's the worst of it. Then you just let them grow. I used this for a serrano pepper plant that basically took over the garden, but I'm fine with that.
0,I got this model specifically for the tail prop.  I thought it would be a good idea for larger woodpeckers and it is.  They love the feeder.  I don't know why the blackbirds haven't demolished my suet like they usually do in a day but I haven't seen one on it so my suet is lasting awhile now  Maybe it's the solid lid.  It's a mystery to me but I'm very happy about it!
0,Perfect replacement parts. Works Great
0,Nice large capacity. Easily removable shower head.
0,I really like that this feeder has the look of metal but is made of impact-resistant plastic. I say impact resistant because I dropped it three times getting it out of the box (yes, I'm clumsy). I was worried the plastic of the feeder trays might crack or shatter, but they were fine. If they had been metal, I probably would have dented them. The container portions are clearly a flexible material, and lightweight, so I wasn't worried about those. Knowing myself, I anticipate many drops in their future, so I was pleased with the durability. I hope the shatter resistance lasts after they've had UV and freezing temperature exposure, but I'll need a year or so to test that.		This feeder has a clever, attractive design. But inverting the containers you can use either or both for dry feed or water. They're easy to remove and refill, and the hanger is both attractive and clever. I was also surprised at how secure it is! The containers stayed put--and didn't even lose any contents--in the aggressive Kansas wind.		It was very popular almost immediately--the downside being that the birds also discovered my tomatoes, and I had an absolute plague of them bothering my tomatoes all summer, even after I removed the feeder. I'll definitely hang it back up in the winter, though I'll probably replace the water with extra feed once it gets cold.		The only con I see is that the containers are a bit small for my taste, though not at all too small on average, compared to other feeders I see on offer. But as someone who's rather lazy and not accustomed to maintaining feeders, I could see refilling becoming an issue.
0,Protection for the winter for my pressure washer..Pricey but effective and easy to use
0,Good, effective cover. Seems to b well made. Could be a bit longer on the sides to go all the way to the ground. 5 years seems to be about the effective life for these outside covers unless they are mostly in the shade where they last longer.
0,This style of fuel can makes it impossible to spill fuel. just push the button then release to stop the flow.
0,I have been using it for years.  I use it to spray around the house foundation.  This is for preventing ants (especially carpenter ants) from getting into my house.  Of course, it alone cannot prevent carpenter ants from getting through.  I still need to trim back the vegetation and tree branches away from my house and my roof.  Otherwise, carpenter ants still can get in through the tree branches.  And I also need to check the downspout to make sure carpenter ants don't use the inside of the downspout as a highway to get into my house (this actually happened).		So far so good ever since I start using it.
0,This inflatable neck pillow is great for travel (and if you spend a lot of time on airplanes you will definitely appreciate the comfort factor!)	The fabric is richly colored (I got the midnight blue) and very plush. You also receive an elegant little carry bag made out of the same fabric.		I received a sample of this product in exchange for my unbiased review.
0,Reasonably quiet and pumps a large volume.  Can't be disassembled, beyond removing the inlet cover, so thorough cleaning may prove difficult.  So far it's handling murky water without issues.
0,Love the gnome but if you are going to hang it outdoors as we did, replace the rope before doing so with something more weather resistant.  Within two weeks of hanging it on a tree rope, it had frayed and fallen.  I replaced mine with polypro.  Rope is only reason this didn't get a 5.
0,Excellent quality. Bought it as a gift, but now I want one for myself!
0,birds are enjoying themselves

0,Best grill I have ever purchased. From day one, the meat i smoked or bbq'd has turned out the best one could expext.  I've paid a lot for grills over the years, and just wished someone would have introduced Traeger grills to me sooner.  Make sure you get the Elite 34 series size.  The ones below this have a smaller grill size, which limits you to how much or large of products you can cook at one time. Totally awesome system..
0,A real whimsical statute that I am so happy to add to my garden. It has received many compliments from my neighbors.
0,I thought this tractor fix was going to be expensive. I received this part next day for under $4 shipping and had it in in minutes. Great part, great shipping, great service.
0,I bought this unit to replace my old Aquabot Turbo.  The Turbo did the job but did annoyingly get caught on my main drain on occasion and spent a lot of time on the walls instead of the floor.		Pros for this unit:	1.  Fast.  Blazingly fast.  Complete coverage of my pool (around 12x 25) in an hour.	2.  Remote control - A bit confusing to use, but a nice feature for when you need to hit one spot that was missed.	3.  Mutli position handle- Fine control on how much time is spent on walls etc.	4.  Intelligent cleaning - The Bot really applies some logic to how to clean the pool rather than just following a simple pattern.  It's amazing to see it change directions in the pool instead of just changing directions as a result of climbing the walls.		Cons	1.  The cord is awkward.  No easy way to "wrap the cord around the unit".	2.  The plug from the bot(due to the remote) screws into the power/control unit.	3.  I'm having a bit of a problem getting it to "stick" to the walls.  I currently have no flotation in and every now and then it pushes itself off from the wall.	4.  Still occasionally gets stuck on a main drain.  Not often but does maybe once out of every five times I run it.		Overall if you can stomach the prices, this is a unit to consider.
0,Works just like it supposed on the model 280.
0,I just used them today and they were quite with an excellent cut.
0,I used these for a cycle with excellent results. Garden grew fast and full. Flowers were full and had amazing aroma. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a 3 - part system. Tip. Feed on the lower end of the ratio with this system.
0,Needed a spare for my pump they do wear over time and is good to have a spare this is my second one.  I recommend this covet
0,Good
0,Its granular chlorine without cyanuric acid.
0,Good product
0,Excellent product and service. A very historical	Flag. And a cool flag for any collection.
0,This stuff works!! It is the best ant killer ever. Sprinkle a little on when they are not agitated and within hours they are gone. I have only used it on ant holes and be careful using it around pets/kids, etc., it is deadly.
0,Good  item for that price !!!! Work good !!!
0,Can't beet the quality and price for these flags.  We display a full veterans flag set up at my house in support of our troops and veterans.  We serve homeless veterans at www.cotsforvets.org and these flags are perfect for all our houses.
0,nice
0,nice and sturdy, nice price!
0,Good value
0,I've been wanting to get one of these.  I'm not sure how it would hold up if the water pressure was lefet on as I tend to do with regular hoses.		I like the fact that it has metal couplings and a shut off valve.  It would be great if there was a shut off on both ends so the pressure could be turned off at the source.  What I've done is attach it to a shorter hose with a shutoff before this hose/  Now I can turn off the water pressure without climbing back into where the shutoff valve is inconveniently located.		Best thing is that it is so light and contracts when pressure is turned off.
0,The pond in our courtyard is only 3'x5' and this little pump is perfect to throw a lovely spray in the air.  It is an improvement over previous pump since it tends not to clog from leaves etc. as much.
0,100 % happy
0,great
0,Just to add some weather protection to our fryer.  Fits perfectly, obviously.
0,works great
0,This is a well made flag that can stand up to the weather of the Rocky Mountains and not fade like most cotton flags.  Good product and I would recommend others to purchase this product too...
0,Excellent product to avoid constant raking and bending over to p/u leaves
0,Thoroughly frustrated with squirrels devouring all my birdseed, I bought one of these at Target about 4 years ago.  It worked so well, I bought a second one at Walmart a few months later.  They have lasted much longer than I thought the springs would hold out, but we have been squirrel proof until this year.  It was entertaining watching the squirrels thinking they had found a bonanza and wondering why they could see but not get to the seeds.  (I truly believe a squirrel will smell a black oil sunflower seed a mile away.)  Anyway, yesterday I saw one enterprising squirrel happily hanging upside down and scooping out tasty treats.  After examination I found he was actually able to chew into the plastic at the bottom, not sure how, but both feeders are damaged and I need to order more.  For $20 I'll order two more and that will last a few more years.  This time I might put a little WD40 on the springs when I get them.
0,good job guys very nice good quality
0,Works as advertised, very fast and precise
0,The birds like it which is the most important.  Not actually "No Waste", a more accurate description would be "A Lot Less Waste".  Much easier to clean up than regular bird seed but still some clean up required.
0,Useful
0,Good belt works great.
0,Got my job done.
0,They hold my front wheel on. They work good.
0,I hate going on the roof, which is unfortunate when you live in the woods. So to avoid as much roof time as possible, I got this to attach to my Ryobi One 18V blower. It fits this blower perfect and does a great job directing the air to the gutters.		I really like the design of these. The quick release at the blower end is nice. The screw together other pieces ensures they stay put and don't leak air. and it's taller than I expected, so I can reach many gutters. I might buy another one so I can reach my other gutters.		The one star off is because after buying this, I got a new blower. The GreenWorks 40V 185MPH blower. That thing is much more powerful than the Ryobi. But the "universal" part of this really isn't universal. It will not fit the GreenWorks blower at all. So I guess I need to keep the Ryobi around.
0,easy to use and work great
0,good product
0,This is the prettiest bird bath, I love it! Seems well built and super easy to clean.
1,I followed the directions, however I seen no result.  Had used it 2 years previously and product worked.  Manufacture change something or moles got wise to the worms and ignored them.
1,I wanted to like this soaker hose because it seemed to seep more water than the hard, round ones I had previously.  Unfortunately, the seam, which is threaded, has busted twice.  I was able to repair each bust since it was near one end or the other by cutting the hose short and reattaching the clamp.  In addition to the bursts, the threading is weak in several spots, allowing more water to seep through in those sections and giving uneven watering along the whole 75' of hose.  Unfortunately, I have a newly installed flower garden (last fall) and this was its first spring, and the root systems needed to be forced to grow to establish the plants for good.  The sprinkler timer came on at 5 AM and ran for one hour each day.  After one month I noticed that my water bill went from $35/month to $140/month.  I expected an increase, but not that much.  I got up one morning and found the water gushing into the air from the hole.  This happened later in the summer, too, from the next hole that developed.  This is a very expensive product based on my experience.  I have repatched it, but am expecting the threads to break apart again.  Unfortunately, I over-trusted the manufacturer, tossed the receipt, and can't take the product back to the place of purchase for a refund.
1,These were so flimsy they couldn't hold even 1 flower. Horrible.
1,So we recently started getting ants in our apartment. When they were so few in number, I decided to just be more thoroughly clean and put food items into sealed containers. I vacuumed, swept, scrubbed, and took out garbage every single day! I even cleaned behind the fridge, microwave, and every other cranny! The ants just kept coming in larger numbers!		I figured they have to be desperate. I even saw one dragging away a toenail my vacuum failed to suck up! That's when I bought these traps. Surely the desperate ants would think they hit the jackpot! I used all six scattered around my home where I saw ants congregating. Nada! The ants didn't take any interest. They apparently rather have toenails than this stuff.
1,Began leaking immediately at the swivel connection within the valve. Of course, with a leak at that point, double washers did not stop the leak, but I thought i would try it any way. What a piece of junk!
1,Product description was for 16ft x 36ft safety pool cover. The product that was delivered was actually a 16ft x 32ft safety pool cover with side step cover. The pool being covered was for a derelict pool on an abandoned property. Since the pool being covered did not have a side step, that portion of the cover was cut off. Additionally, a deck had to be constructed consisting of 16ft 2x4's and 2 sheets of 5/8 plywood to shorten the length of the pool while attaching the end of the pool cover to the wood deck so the cover would fit over the pool opening. These modifications are definitely not recommended but since the job had a strict deadline, there was no time to deal with the vendor to request a refund or shipment of the correct pool cover. With all of this being said, you will be hard pressed to find a safety pool cover for a cheaper price anywhere - just make sure its what you ordered before committing to deadlines or taking it to the job site.
1,BEARLY GROWING???
1,Flowers still froze, not thick enough.  Tore apart after 2 uses.  Best for very mild climates and not for freezing prevention.  Not sure what other use it can have.
1,both of the temperature controller's broke, they sent me a new one that worked for about a week and the display was out on it too
1,Does not work waste of money
1,It lasted a month then the outside sensor goes out.  I spoke with the company they were good about replacing the sensor it took a week.  This new sensor lasted about 9 days so I have to go back to the manufacture to see what is the next step.
1,So, this pretty much does everything that it says it'll do, but 1) the rain gauge quit working and 2) I want more manual override.		For 1), If you notice any problems with you unit, you better hope it happens within your store's return period because RAIN BIRD DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY WARRANTY.  Go ahead and google it.  I will not buy another piece of equipment from them because of this.  I installed this in the fall and didn't notice issues. Come Spring, it kept watering despite raining.  I double, triple checked all troubleshooting and even though it indicates that it is connected via LED, it didn't work.  I tried pouring 16 ounces of water directly onto it and it still watered.		For 2), the big issues I had was that I live in Colorado and we get some really whacky Spring weather.  I need the ability to easily override it and tell it to just run a certain amount of time.  This doesn't let you do that without going ahead and running a full cycle right then and there.  What I mean is that it wants you to put in the watering schedule for peak season and it'll automatically adjust.  Well, when it is Spring and I suddenly get 5 days of 80 degree weather, but this thing thinks that it should only be running at 10% of normal since it is April, it is really annoying that I can't just flip it from auto adjust to JUST RUN THE TIMES I SAID WITHOUT ADJUSTING.  It simply needs an additional dial setting of MANUAL.
1,This thing doesn't work and the cost of replacement pads and cartridges is ridiculous - don't buy this - its a waste of money.
1,Thay don't stay on always falling off
1,We bought four and 3 went bad in about a month
1,The battery was weak from the beginning and died after a year or so.  A replacement cost as much as the whole thing did.  I wouldn't buy it again.
1,writing washes off with the rain and irrigation.  tried many different types of writing implements.
1,I have yet to see any birds come close to this thing.	Replaced and old cracked birdbath for this.	Would not recommend
1,Although a good idea this product broke the first time out due to poor construction. Using it the first time the top rod broke	hauling less than the advertised capacity of TOTALLY dry leaves. I would not recommend this to anyone with less than a handful	of leaves unless you plan on reinforcing the support rods.
1,could not get all the lights to work on the taller of the two, had to rapped an additional length of lighting to complete the tree.
1,i put this corn out over a month ago and its still there no animal will eat it
1,Nothing. These seeds are very tiny but I was careful to insert them in a growing pod and nothing has came up. And, I really wanted this to grow!
1,did not grow and I have a great huge garden so it wasn't due to me!
1,I was wanting rocks like the ones pictured.  The sizes were bigger than pictured.  The rocks were not shaped flat as pictured.  I was lucky to be able to use half for their intended purpose, which was painting them.
1,I put it right next to a mouse trap, activated, I still cough a mouse.....I do not thing it works.
1,None came up.  Seeds from China not such a good idea.
1,It has a sickening odor that fills the room. Threw them out.
1,What a piece of garbage this is. I t worked great for 9 weeks and broke.
1,I wish I had read reviews on here before I paid the money and got this.  I got mine directly from Mantis.	First off, you need a rachet set to put it together, so if you don't have one, you will have to buy it, or some wrenches.  They wanted $50 to send it to me assembled.  I wish I had paid it.  The instructions for assembly are vague and I didn't have the right tools so had to buy them.  Even putting the nuts on finger tight was difficult.  Seemed like the nuts didn't fit the bolts or something.	Got it together and was excited to run it.  Again vague instructions on starting it. I had to call the company while out in the field.  I did get it started but had to work at it.  It ran great, no stalling, but after about 10 min. of work, the bolts started to come undone.  It was like the nuts didn't really fit onto the bolts, you could barely thread them at all by hand to get it started and even some of the plastic do-dads were vibrating off.  I lost a wing nut.		So I had a lunch break and went back to work. Again, hard to start but I got it going.	This makes me sad.  Now I've read other reviews about needing fresh gas constantly and problems.  I feel like sending it back.		And you may note that the good reviews were written about 2, 3 years ago, so clearly Mantis has sent the manufacturing to some place else.  Too bad.
1,I thought this was a birdhouse.  The inside is completely hollow (there are no shelves inside for birds to build nests in) and it's only intended as a decoration.  On a stick about two feet long.  WTF?
1,I just received this item and it appears to be solid and easy to use, but I only received one even though the description says 6 stations. I'm returning now.
1,So the dirt itself was great but it seems to have picked up a little friendly plant knat within its dirt.  Once I opened it all the plants I used it on were infected with the knat.  It doesn't really harm them it just lays babies in the moist part of the dirt and they feed on the dirt and organic materials in the soil but once it's gone they start on the plant.  I'd still buy, but they do need to do something a bit better to ensure they aren't selling bags with knat babies in it like I got.
1,I loved how this one looks, and I love the idea of a classy piece of glass art doubling as a bird feeder. I struggled with it for two years before finally hanging it in the garage, where it's been for another 3 years. I find that I can't bring myself to hang it back up because of how hard it is to clean and the seed that it wastes. Moisture gathers at the bottom, and before you know it, you've got mold growing in a clump of damp seed at the bottom. It's then very hard to get at the clump of rotten seed, and I was using chopsticks or anything that could reach down. Either that or you have to take it apart, which is a pain. Taking it apart eventually becomes impossible as the screw at the bottom rusts and it gets stuck in place.	Still looks good, but is not functional. Still hanging in the garage because I don't know that to do with it now.
1,Glyphosate is a "probable carcinogen"
1,Not one single seed germinated. I grew up farming and planting flowers, and continue to do so. I consider myself a master gardener and can grow most anything, but the seeds were no good.
1,These mats did work to cook my steaks, and I do cook out a LOT.  I'm not that fond of it though for these reasons, 1) I didn't get the lovely grill marks until my steaks were WELL done.  Now, there were some light grill marks on the medium and medium rare ones, but just faint on the med rare.  2) I was worried they were going to melt the entire time because, as the fats and juices run over into the fire, the fire is just too intense for the mats.  They didn't actually melt, but they actually did LOOK like they were indeed melting.  3) Chemical smell during cooking - I was actually wondering why I was ordering these since everyone knows good and well that they are all chemical.  For the same reason I won't bake with silicon or microwave in plastic or drink from a bpa bottle...who wants chemicals in their food?  The manufacturers of these products may "SAY" these products are "SAFE" but how many times did we hear that about plastic, teflon, styrofoam, prescription pills, tanning beds, margarine, food dyes, and some pesticides.  I mean it seriously, I could smell a burning plastic smell when the heat got intense.  However, the meat was juicy and didn't burn.  So I guess it's just where your concerns and preferences lie.  It works good, I'm just concerned about the chemicals emitted during cooking.  My grill stayed clean, and they were easy to wash up.  Easy...like teflon almost.
1,There is no excuse to having a box that leaks all over the place. I could not even use this stuff because it leaked all over the inside of my Amazon box. I did not bother from that point on. Be forewarned.
1,I finally put these in my pond this year and I have to say, I hate them. I liked the idea of buying these slightly smaller  media filters and replacing them each year. However what I found was that after installing them, the pond looked fine for a couple of weeks but then started turning dark. I added more chemicals than I had to the previous year but even that didn't help. I was unable to keep my pond looking clear. So I took a look at the filters and noticed that they were NOT filtering out the waste. Instead the waste was just sitting on top and as a result being sent right back down the waterfall. I pulled out the filters, only the top one looked dirty, put back the old type of filters and within one day, the pond was clear and beautiful again! I will definitely go back to my old reusable style media instead of using these.
1,The color bar for the chlorine test is identical for all levels. The rest of the kit is ok. I am happy that Amazon stands behind these products and is giving me a refund.  I see a few other ratings with similar complaints about the test color differentiation.  There must be a quality control issue in manufacturing since many others are apparently OK.  These should be checked before sending them out.  And I hate to say it , but they are "Proudly made in the USA".
1,Seeds won't grow in rich organic soil.
1,The aloe came looking burnt on the ends.  The other 2 were so small in the pot, you can hardly see them. I will make a terrarium out of it for my den, but I will not order from this company again. Masking tape all over the plastic pots. They should be arrested for cruelty to plants. Order from another place. I received so much better from others.
1,DID Not work well. It shipped quickly.
1,great idea but like would break where it comes out of the side as soon as trimmer came up to speed without even using.
1,Even if these are hibiscus seeds, they surely won't look like the photo. The stock photo was stolen from another nursery's website, and then PHOTOSHOPPED to become bright blue. It was originally a picture of purplish/light yellow hibiscus.		Plus, the "Icy Silver" name is completely made up. Because if you steal a photo and photoshop it, you might as well come up with a new name.		If you want to see the original photo, see my comment. I'm not allowed to post links in reviews.
1,This item is not as described, The item is ONLY the sponge filter, It does NOT include the filter housing or the housing base circular gasket. The filter alone can be found elsewhere cheaper. Buyer beware.
1,Item arrived before due date. I did not like these clippers.
1,I bought 2 bags.  The first thing I noticed is the bags were different than advertised.  But I didn't think anything of it... Then I opened them.  WOW.  The particle sizes were insanely diverse!  Check out my pictures!  The pictures are just a sample pinch, not the worst!  The problem with this is first the small ones flood out the spreader, but then the large, heavy ones come and plug the outlet!  See more pictures!	My soil test called for 1 pound per 1000 sq ft.  I set the spreader to 6 pounds per 1000 sq ft and tried to apply it...  The first pass I made was a flood of fertilizer!  During the second pass not much came out.  During the third pass nothing came out!  All the large pieces had sank and plugged the opening!  I couldn't believe it.  I spread the rest by throwing fist-fulls of it.
1,Nothing grew!
1,way too big for bistro chairs... look ridiculous on bistro chairs
1,Disappointed
1,Start leaking after using 1 month. Cannot return either. Horrible.
1,Re-engineered for profit (IMHO) not quality	Greed does seem to be a factor with Pentair..no wonder their stock just hit a 52 week low, it will go lower (I am a Day Trader).	Looks like karma is about to grind Pentair into the earth (diatomaceous earth of course).	But their quality is(was) top notch.
1,This would be nice except it is very hard to drain the grease from it	It doesn't work well it is very hard to turn the bacon once it has cooked on one side because it has been formed over the sides	Potential Burns are very possible	Returned it
1,Waste of money. The blower tube looks short, well it is, might be great for kid but 5ft 9 inches have to stay bent over to blow leaves because this thing has NO POWER at all. Maybe if you are just blowing sidewalk with few leaves but any amount of leaves and forget it.
1,Does NOT work.  Terrible set up.
1,I tried using this in several parts of our yard, lawn, planting beds, etc. during different weather conditions and weeks apart without success. The meter barely moved at all. The only time I could get it to budge was to place it directly in a glass of water.		Per other's reviews I tried sticking the probes in at various levels, from a few inches to all the way down to the meter itself. Almost zero change in moisture and no change at all in PH.		We live in the Northwest and have had record-setting rains this season. I tried using it right after a downpour and in-between storms. Before fertilizing and after. Still no appreciable change.		I've added photos of the meter "at rest" as well as in a glass of water. You'd think that in a glass of water it would peg to the "wet" side, but not even that.		Waited too long to return it so it'll go to a landfill which is too bad.
1,More water at the beginning than end. Kinks easily.
1,Was damaged right off the pack.
1,Not a single seed sprouted -NOT A ONE-  0 FOR 200- SERIOUSLY, What a WASTE of money, DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER !!!Not a single seed sprouted -NOT A ONE-  0 FOR 500- SERIOUSLY, What a WASTE of money, DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER !!!Not a single seed sprouted -NOT A ONE-  0 FOR 500- SERIOUSLY, What a WASTE of money, DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER !!!
1,not really that effective
1,What germinated in the special areas set aside for these was a single species of very invasive weed. These seeds were astounding failures.
1,Arrived and did not work
1,I have used several of these bug zappers over the last the few years. This one should be avoided. The construction is good but there are too many flaws to recommend to anyone. The area of electric screen is too small; this means you must get very close to your prey to have any chance of hitting it. There is a reason they make tennis rackets bigger nowadays--they make it easier to hit the ball. The flat top may be an advantage to get close to flies on a window but I was never able to get one without missing. The second flaw is the to electrify the screen you must continuously push up on a rather stiff spring-loaded switch. It is trying to keep it up while searching for flies in the various corners of my kitchen. Most zappers have a simple button that is easy to hold down while holding. The third flaw is the inclusion of a flashlight. All I can ask is "Why?" A light a the bottom of the screen makes it pretty useless as a flashlight. It has no function in attracting bugs (perhaps a blue light may be a better idea). After trying for a few days with a bunch of flies that seem to invade my kitchen this time of year I got a grand total of Zero flies (while using my old larger zapper I was then able to kill every one). Overall, I would say you can find much better zappers than this one.
1,Product has a three year warranty, which is about right because the product completely fell apart just after three years - literally, falling apart, tears, holes, etc.  Am going to look for a higher quality product this time.
1,Does not let hose come back out easily. Have to pull on hose and turn wheel yourself. By the time I got the hose pulled out, I had to take  break, before I could water. Does roll up, but it wastes a lot of water in doing so. Don't waste your money.
1,First off, as we all can see here, they still display the feeder with RED DYE sugar solution. When are people going to finally realize that the red dye kills the birds in the long run? There is no need for that, just water and sugar do very well!	As for this feeder, my first one broke off at the screw neck as soon as I wanted to put the bottom part (plastic) onto the bottle. I did not twist hard at all. The glass just sheared apart (see photo). The company was nice enough to send a replacement right away. The new one did not shear apart.	The thing I do not like at all about this feeder is that one cannot take apart the bottom part, made of plastic. There is no way to wash it out thoroughly. The inside is quite convoluted, and even a bottle brush won't reach those remote nooks and crannies. I try to sterilize it each time with boiling water, but that is probably not good enough in the long run. (Imagine a dead ant stuck in a corner.)	Second, the two parts (flat bottom and domed top) of the feeder are not leak-free. The liquid keeps seeping down, with droplets gathering under the bottom, and it attracts wasps and ants. I fixed this by dribbling a bead of power glue along the joint line, to seal it off. That seems to work.	All in all, I guess I'll use it until the inside of the red plastic bottoms is too dirty to use, then ditch these.	Pick a model that can be totally disassembled, for the hummies'  health sake! And stay away from the red stuff!	If you found this review helpful, please, let me know! Thank you!
1,Did not scare ducks.  They still flew right next to it in our pool.
1,Bees and mice love this stuff. Hummingbirds? Not so much.
1,Never produced and all my other sunflowers did
1,Doesnt fit right no matter how i turn it but i still use it & just throw it on its not like how the picture looks
1,Noticed small, fluid filled sacks in the soil when I was filling pots. Thought it was strange, but didn't think they might be eggs. Then the flies started coming.		I already had about 20 plants growing well with no sign of flies. Based on seeing the eggs in the soil and the timing of the onslaught of flies in the days after first using the MiracleGro, I feel safe assuming they came from that bag of soil		The "flies" were actually fungus gnats. I did some research online to determine what they were. The best way to combat them is to dry out the soil, where their eggs and larvae are, and halt the life cycle. This worked well, but the lack of water killed 90% of my plants.		If you do a search for fungus gnats and MiracleGro, you'll find many customers have fungus gnat issues with their products.		Time to start over. Won't be using MiracleGro this time.
1,Looks cute but does not deter ants from climbing down to my hummingbird feeder. Im bummed.
1,Might be a good product to buy & keep if all the parts to repair it were available from Toro.		This UltraPlus Blower/Vac arrived with the variable off/on switch defective.  It ran at one speed only & could not be turned off.		I confirmed that Toro does not list a part # for that switch.  As others have reported, it is therefore not repairable if that part is or becomes defective.		Makes no sense to me,  but apparently Toro thinks that is a good business decision.
1,Garbage!  Pic says it all.
1,Didn't cover said amount of are that good
1,I used this while trying to kill wasps and it shoots only about 3 feet! It did not perform as promised!
1,SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO OTHER REVIEWERS  GOT 2 INCHES SNOW TODAY BOTTOM SNOW WET MELTING ON DRIVEWAY	  THIS WAS USELESS CLOGGED THREW SNOW 4 INCHES  WILL BE DONATING TO GOODWILL FOR TAX WRITEOFF
1,These seeds never germinated.
1,I bought this at a big box hardware store because I needed a pruner while on a trip to my daughters home in another state.  The Dual cutting feature sounded great and the Corona name was the clincher.  I have had very good use from my Corona pruners and expected the same with the BP7100.  The feel was a little different and the "Notch" for larger cuts is not well formed, allowing the branch to slip out of position during the cut.  The biggest disappointment however was the plastic locking feature, which is positioned awkwardly and has broken after only about 5 uses.  I tossed the receipt when I bought it, so NO return.  I have a velcro strip cable tie to keep the blade closed now, and that is very inconvenient.  The old design was, and is, far superior.
1,Puny, Malignant Dwarf Growth, Save Your Money, Buy	At Your Local Discount Store
1,Although this plant arrived in pretty good condition (three leaves, forth coming out), it needed alittle attn. to look like a healthy plant. After repotting and placing in a sunny window, it put out one more leaf then stopped doing ANYTHING. After over a month, I am still waiting to see what it will become. And not a particularly attractive house plant while I wait. I will keep tending it but would not recommend it to anyone.
1,I've purchased several of these, and while they work fine and don't have any leaking issues, the plastic inside is cheap. I bumped one of these while it was attached to the silcock and it snapped off right above the word "Homitt". Clean break. I'll be replacing the broken one with an all-metal brand.		UPDATE: I've dropped this to 1 star from 3. The second one I purchased just broke in exactly the same way. This time, just from the stress of pulling on an attached hose enough to move the weight of the hose. The all plastic connection between the silcock and the connector is far to weak.		Do not buy this item. The all metal options out there are no more expensive. Get that.
1,When you refill 1lb tank it might last 5 mins if your lucky
1,Since I am very familiar with Aerogarden pods I did not read the product description and let myself go by the product photo, which clearly shows THREE seeded pods.  I know that I will get spacers in almost every kit and that's fine but if the photo shows three seeded pods I don't expect to have to read the small print to make sure what I get from a product that I havebeen buying for years.
1,It brings a lot of mosquito :(
1,did not receive item like picture so not universal beware!
1,I haven't had these 2 months and they are already turning yellow. When in full sunshine they don't hold a charge. I would not tell a friend
1,Specs say it will fit 16 inch chainsaw including Remington m30016 aw.  I took a while to get to the job but after much trying it would not fit.  Compared with the old chain I was trying to replace one can see that the one I bought is smaller- too small to fit. I wasted the purchase price.  I waited too long to return it so I'm disappointed in Oregon.
1,The hose is cheap and kinked. It doesn't have the parts it should have to divert the overflow back to the gutter pipe. and the mold marks are about 1/4" off.		For $50 maybe. For $100+ someone is making a fortune off these things.		Buy and old wooden barrel. Get some fittings, and you have yourseflf a nice garden ornament to keep enough water to do a minute contribution to the enviroment.		What I ended up doing is hooking up a long hose with a dripper every 6 feet or so. When the tank is full it slowly irrigates the garden. Don't count on the hose that comes with it to do anything except give you a drink of dirty water.
1,It broke on the SECOND use, working on getting a refund
1,I must not be using this bag properly because it has defeated me.  Hanging it on the faucet handle as directed is awkward and not attractive  at all.  But getting it into and out of the bag is confounding me.  The time required to do it effectively defeats the whole purpose.  I am not giving up because I do think that it is an idea whose time has come.  The bag is well made and matches the hose so that is good.
1,Edit:  my orchid is dead now! So i guess it needed that soggy sawdust in order to live.  original review: Well, this is a bag of bark chunks, mostly.  I wish I had potted my poor orchid much, much sooner!  The result is very good so far.  I removed junk that looked like mushy sawdust and replaced the pot and filled it with this mix.  No more rotten roots, that is for sure.  After all, they do grow on trees in nature!
1,Ordered 4000, and didn't seem to make a dent. I would have rather spent the money on bug bombs. They arrived alive, and even in a week, there was no visible results, even when let loose at the problem areas. I don't understand what happened.
1,I was really cranked about receiving my "WORX  Lil Mo'  14" cordless mower" from Amazon.com and when it arrived, I was doubly excited about how it looked. I assembled the tool and was just BOWLED OVER with enthusiasm with all the features and the appearance		 . . . .  until I actually tried MOWING with it.		If you're thinking of purchasing this item to use as a 4-wheeled grass trimmer, then you MAY be pleased with it. If you're looking for it to be like a regular mower which cuts a smooth swath, FERGIT IT! For some reason, this thing just sorta "beats" the grass to somewhat the desired height. 'Dunno if it doesn't have enough "pull" on the uncut blades of grass to hold them in a vertical position for cutting or not. All I know is that I'd originally purchased the tool as a grass trimmer - and thassabout all you can expect out of it.		Also, there's the issue about the false advertising:		I was thinking that a 14" mower would be the absolute smallest that I'd be wanting or could use. SURPRISE! It has a 13" cutting swath - a direct untruth from reading the ad on Amazon. ("14-inch cutting width," I believe is how it's stated.) The specifications sent with the "mower" state that the cutting diameter (which is also the cutting width) is 13."		I had decided to purchase this "WORX" product as I'd seen raving revues and more than one website putting "WORX" products ahead of others - at the top of the comparison list, in fact. ('Dunno of these websites were put together by "WORX" or not, however.) I guess you can't believe an ounce of stuff read or heard over any media, including the Internet (...'cept this review, of course.) 'Only have two words for you, in conclusion.....		BUYER BEWARE!
1,It only worked for one day. I found it awkward to use, especially for bugs on the window. Then it turned out bugs smell when they're fried, and I didn't like that. Gave it away.
1,Leaked!
1,terrible product. used it once, the second time it broke. do not recommend it.
1,I bought this fencing to put in front of my flowers under my window....		Boy, was I bummed when it came today... It is ONE PIECE OF PLASTIC FENCE FOR over $12!!		Maybe I didn't read the description as well as I shouldve.	But I really thought I was getting a little fencing, not one piece!		I added a picture of the piece I got, I am going to be returning it tomorrow! What a waste...
1,Giant for large trees not for potted plants
1,I've purchased 20 pounds of 1/2 inch American Fireglass fire pit glass in a different color to fill a new pit,  So, the moment I pulled this product out of the box, I could tell that something wasn't right.  At first I thought I had been shipped the 1/4 inch size by mistake, but upon opening the bag I could see that there were some 1/2 inch pieces.  Unfortunately, my 5 pound package contained over 2 pounds of dangerously small and sharp pieces of glass chips and glass dust.  If I hadn't needed the extra glass to enhance the look of our fire pit for a party we were having, I would have returned it.  I still gave this product two stars because the color was beautiful and exactly what I wanted and because the pieces that were actually 1/2 inch glass were a nice variety of shapes and perfectly smooth.  If not for the issue with the 2 pounds of worthless dangerous crap, it would have been a 5 star purchase.  I ordered two 5 pound bags, and would have been able to share if the condition of this particular bag was fluke, except the second bag did not arrive as promised and is still in transit.  So this purchase was a double disappointment.  I've already initiated the return on that package, since I could have saved money by ordering a 10 pound package, if I had been willing to wait a few extra days for it to arrive, which I was not.
1,After using the old wooden mouse traps for years, I discovered they just don't seem to work as well as they used to and mice would often lick the traps clean.  So, I began buying different traps to experiment and see if I could find a better trap.  The TOMCAT REUSABLE MOUSETRAP was one of the traps I tried.  The traps say that they offer a "clean to-touch disposal" whose "patented design is guaranteed effective".  I should have contacted the company about that guarantee because these traps do not work at all. I tried using these traps for a week. Each morning I would awaken to find the traps still set, but licked clean of the peanut butter and cheese. After trying to catch mice for a week using TOMCAT REUSABLE MOUSE TRAPS I gave up and threw the traps away. Even though the wooden traps aren't as reliable as they used to be, they at least caught a mouse eventually. These traps are a waste of money. DO NOT buy.
1,Mine died and I have a huge garden with lots of plants I did everything right I noticed right when it got here it got worst and worst :( I'm sad
1,As soon as the first big breeze came through, this one jumped out of the holder I wedged it into, and flipped over, breaking a rib. Done. I ordered another brand.
1,Description of the product says new, but it is very clear that it is a used product. The sticker on it says Goodwill and priced at 1.49. I paid 9 bucks for this. Be careful!
1,Anyone have tips on getting them to grow from seed? I'm not getting one sprout!
1,These do not work well. I had to return them.
1,Having seen most of the zillions of YouTube videos reviewing this Kukri I decided to buy one and see what all the hubbub was about.  Over my 50+ years of backpacking/camping I have never carried a machete.  My tool compliments consisted of a large camping/hunting utility knife, a Gransfors Bruks small forest axe, and an assortment of different pocket knives.		Straight out of the box, you will notice that the edge is for the most part non-existent.  It took several hours to nurse the blade into anything remotely even close to utility status.  I will say that I am not used to sharpening anything with this much curve to it, and it took some time to figure out the combination.		My next disappointment came from the size of the handle.  For someone with large hands like me, the handle is too small around which made it uncomfortable while chopping.  The grip finish is excellent however.  This one shouldn't slip out of your hand.  A quick note about the supplied sheath... try not to laugh (or cry) at how cheap and flimsy it is.  Granted, this is not a top of the line tool, but Cold Steel is trying to make headway into a crowded field and putting stuff like this sheath out there is not going to help.		Finally, the chopping test.  I went out back and selected a small (5 inch) dead tree and commenced to get medieval on it with the Kukri.  After finishing I had to wonder why on earth anyone would use a machete to cut down small trees when an axe is clearly the quickest best method.  That being said...I'm sure the machete has its place somewhere out in the bush.  That place just won't be in my backpack.
1,Ended up screwing on to my power head so tight I couldn't remove it.  Had to buy a new gearbox to fit my wire trimmer so now  switching requires changing to the gearbox dedicated to this trimmer head.  Fun.
1,We plant organic every year and thought of trying a new supplier so we ordered these.  The harvest was disappointing. They were tiny potatoes, i mean tiny potatoes and we received about 2 to 3 per plant.  Will go back to the previous supplier.
1,broke after two weeks. when it was working it did an excellent job
1,They never sprouted, though other strawberry seeds I had did. You are better off getting strawberry roots.
1,this is nothing more than neem oil with a fancy name it does not eliminate mites worth beans it would be better to just buy neem oil if your afraid of pyrethrins or some affective solution to bugs in your garden
1,UPDATE....I originally gave this product a good rating however after five months it looks like crap. Would not recommend.  Please see my pics. I used numerous stakes and the product still warped.
1,I was very disappointed with this trimmer.  The battery would not hold a 5 minute charge. No problem, I bought another one.  It had the same problem. The Worx company promised me I was eligible for a free battery.  Well, that never happened and the company closed that web site. After fooling with it for one season, I cut it into pieces and placed it into the trash can. Lesson learned.
1,Came from Hong Kong which was not stated in description or I would not have bought them to begin with. NONE of them grew. Waste of money!!
1,sprouted, died...
1,It will be great if the sun actually would charge the battery. The battery dies in less than a month
1,Have used and mixed stronger than directions say. Do not see any results.
1,Installed this pressure gauge in my pool filter and it initially worked great.  After 3 days it got stuck at 15 PSI and hasn't worked since.  Waste of time and money.
1,Most of the corn we buy in products is GMO corn unless specified differently. I want to help my birds and I can't in good conscience feed something that is detrimental to their health. I will not be buying this product until it says "GMO free."
1,DINT LIKED
1,Does not look on what is on the photo, Cheap plastic!!
1,it broke for no reason
1,Getting rid of the Northwest's Townsend's moles when you live next to a forest and creek is a big challenge.  We've tried just about every product we could find and nothing really works all that well.  Conceptually, this is a good product and the quality is good.  Getting used to arming it is a matter of carefully following the written directions and then practicing until you are comfortable with it.  On one or two occasions, I accidentally triggered the device while trying to put the dual safeties back in their safe positions.  The Molecat fired its .27 caliber blank cartridge with a loud bang that certainly got my attention but did no harm since the cartridge expended its energy into the ground.  I bought four of these devices and have set them repeatedly with only 3 "possible" kills for my time and money.  Still, I think the only way for a homeowner to have much chance to control moles near a forest and creek is to use a multi-facet strategy consisting of repellant, gas, sonic sound emitters, and possibly even a galvanized hardware cloth barrier installed in a two-foot deep trench as one expert advised.  So far, I'd say the moles are winning in our yard but I plan to keep using the Molecat devices as part of my battle strategy against the moles.
1,It does not work on pantry bugs.  I see a lot of dead bugs where I spray with an insecticide but these traps are clean or occasionally catch a few stupid ones who must have accidentally walked in to the trap.
1,Worked well for about 35 days or so....just long enough to be "not eligible for return"....just stopped working.	Needless to say, we are not pleased.  Tremendously overprice item that does not last a little more than a month.
1,This spade is not what its name implies.  The handle is plastic and it cracked in half during light duty use when the spade was practically new.  It also arrived with an extremely dull blade.
1,These jiffy pellets have always been great for the past 7 years that I have been planting vegetable seeds in them BUT this year nothing would even sprout in them . I used 7 different kinds of seeds so the pellet dirt was bad.
1,UPDATE: Two months later and I am no better off. I have attempted to use customer service to help me and they are completely useless. After all of the calls mentioned below I finally was allowed to send it back in for testing. In my calls, it was explicitly noted that the unit would in fact connect and stay that way for any period of time. At SOME time later the unit would disconnect. Several techs could not understand it. Jason was very helpful and arranged the return.		I received an email from Matt with QA and he stated it tested fine, they got it connected, no issues and they were returning the unit. I replied and explained that he was correct, but if he could review the account he would see that it would later disconnect. He didn't respond, just sent me back my unit. Now, the unit won't connect at all.		I am forced to call again, try to go through the steps again. What a mess.		Original review:		Frustrated. Thats how I feel about this product. I got it up and running with ease within minutes of receiving it. For a few hours it reported glorious data back to my iPhone. Then, the next morning I open the app and the data stopped pushing sometime during the night. I ran through the install procedure again and nothing. Called tech support  (which is US based) and got a person on the phone after waiting about 40 minutes. We ran through trouble shooting for about an hour and finally she said she would have to consult someone else that was not at the office yet. She said she would call me back in 30 minutes.		It is now the next day and I have not heard back from customer service. Called this morning and there are 14 people in line on tech support which likely means I will wait an hour to talk to someone. I ran through the install procedure again and it worked! But within half an hour it stopped again. What gives?		Why won't someone call me back? Ugh. Guess Ill have to try again.
1,This works well for light, fluffy dry snow. However, the width of this item isn't really enough to do much good ... and it is heavier than a shovel or broom. We had it for years yet rarely used it. Light shovels and brooms do just as well without having to dig out electrical cords and lug around something that will only clean a narrow path.		One day the base simply snapped from the handle. A relief actually ... one less useless tool taking up room for others in the garage.		We won't repurchase, and I don't recommend.
1,I don't know what's in here but do not believe there's much gypsum. I've used gypsum on my tomatoes & peppers for years as a remedy for blossom end rot. The results have always been immediate and dramatic. With three applications of this stuff I saw no results at all.
1,I bought a piece of Generac equipment last June.  It worked great for hte first few months.  Unfortunately, the following April one of the components failed.  I took the piece of equipment to an authorized repair shop around April 15th for warranty repair work.		It is May 23rd and they still have not repaired my equipment.  When I call GENERAC cusotmer service they refuse to help me because I cannot give them a repair order number.  When I call the repair shop they claim GENERAC has not assigned a order number even though they've completed the paperwork and sent it in.		I emailed GENERAC detailing when I dropped off the equipment, and noted that I was having trouble getting my item repaired in a timely manner.  GENERAC never responded.		I'm very disappointed in their complete failure to stand by their products and repair them in a timely manner.
1,Seam failed in 4 months. Read the warranty, it comes with a standard one year warranty. They will replace the filter.... After you, the buyer , disconnects the failed part, removes the sand, and spends your money to ship it back to them. Did I mention it cost half the price of the filter to ship it back? What about the time and cost to remove the filter, replace the sand, and the 10 to 14 days with out filtering your pool since they won't expedite shipping back a new filter. The cost to rebalance your pool chemistry can be expensive. Bottom line for me is to buy something like this local.
1,Above ground height is only 38 inches. The manufacturer says in the Amazon questions that it is 42 inches. From bottom of the post to the top is only 47 inches. Quality of the post is exactly as described but units of measure are a lie.
1,worked once
1,Missing from front porch .
1,Purchased two of these. They were NOT as described so, without hooking up I put them back into the same box within two minutes and asked for a return. Then I had to pay shipping cost on an item that did NOT do what it was supposed to do! A real scam here
1,Very disappointed.  Bought 2 of these.  One had 2 small holes in it.  I would have expected better for the price.  Apparently the quality control is not what I thought it would be.
1,I distributed the seeds in an area about 20 by 20. Still waiting for something to grow. Ive been watering it everyday. So far nothing.
1,Didn't work, could not get it to work so returned it and bought The Weather Channel Wireless Thermometer
1,I was shocked and upset after thinking that I had just found the holy grail of leaf rakes. Within 10 minutes it split in the middle. Within 20 minutes it had lost 2 teeth. And the worst part? I wasn't being hard on it at all! Just raking up slightly damp leaves and not even a ton of them. What a P-O-S! Never again!!!
1,NONE GERMINATED
1,no color.  how sad
1,It smells nice, that's it. I used it to sprinkle all over the potted plants/dirt on my porch as the mosquitoes nest in there and I can't seem to find any way to get rid of them other than spraying Raid all over the plant every time I want to go out there and sit for a while. I put these granules all over the dirt and plant it made NO impact on them nesting/breeding in the plant, I guess they thought it smelled nice too.
1,The piece itself is nice, but the opening is too small for an average downspout.  I have to put it elsewhere in my garden.
1,I can't get the parts of the tube to fit together; one is oval and the other is round so they don't click together.  The diagram for assembly is not very good.  The tools and accessories are made in China - had I know it's not American made I wouldn't have bought it.  I bought it in the fall but didn't open it until a week ago so now I guess I'm stuck with it.
1,The tines bend too easily and the rubber handle cover keeps sliding back and off even under light usage.  Made in Mexico.
1,I think that Racoons like this product more than mice. I have reverted back to old style traps.	This product is far too expensive for unknown results.
1,the item was very cheaply made for the price. We returned it. Quality is about like the wheeling mesh laundry hampers found in walmart or target, which may be ok but the mesh was thin and the pipes were like 1/2" and some didn't fit tighty into the fittings. Just felt for 80 bucks it wouldnt last a month outside near the pool.
1,I hate to complain but I have tried 4 they all leaked they are leaking on the seam where they are sealed together the last one came all the way apart dumped about a gallon and a half of fuel in my garage I am glad we are having a heat wave in va beach this week and my gas heater wasn't running these things are dangerous. I could understand maybe one leaking but four in a row... the rest of them are going in the garbage.
1,wrong size. I guessed and was wrong. Oh well. Have other projects so should find a use for it.
1,Did not fit well and feels thin
1,"Gro Pro Round Fabric Pot, 3-Gallon, Tan, 72 Per Case"	That was the original product description when I purchased these (this) product. It was listed as "72 per case", very clearly in the product description summary at the top of the page.	I received a SINGLE fabric pot, not the "72 per case" as advertised.	It seems they have since changed the product description.  The price for a "single" fabric pot is definitely too much, as these won't last past a single growing season.
1,I ordered two of these hoses and had them both fail within 10 days of first using them.  I live in Kuwait and the water pressure in our place is significantly lower than it would be back home and despite these conditions both hoses were leaking within ten days and one of the hoses completely disintegrated in that time with the interior hose dislodging from the hose connector head - making it completely useless.  Beyond that, the seller (who must know they are selling junk) offers no recourse other than to deal directly with Amazon - they don't even have a means of contacting them unless you want to offer a 'thank you'.  Now, I have to ship this junk back to Amazon from Kuwait in order to get a refund.  Stay away from this brand and anyone willing to sell it.
1,It smells nice, has a strong citronella scent. Burns nicely. The lid protects the candle when not in use. Kept it right next to me, but the bugs still bit me anyway. It makes a nice outdoor candle, but not for keeping away bugs.
1,Purchased these based on the reviews. We have been having mice problems in our basement. Had been using the Tomcat sticky traps but was looking for something more cost effective and purchased these.  The first mouse got on the Catchmaster and got off the Catchmaster after pulling a few hairs out. The mouse then got caught and stuck on the Tomcat trap I had beside it and could not get loose.		I then reset two new Catchmaster traps. You can see a photo below of what happened a few days later. Mouse walks on, pulls a few hairs out and walks away. Needless to say I will be returning these after two failures.
1,These lights are the same as eshine lights they basically double the price sometimes more don't be scammed watch the video below.	[...]
1,The only thing it  caught was mold on the bait
1,1*
1,The cucumbers were good, though the plant didn't seem as productive as other cuke plants.  But these vines were easily 5 to 6 feet long, and in a cucumber that is labeled spacemaster.  They did not take over the garden fence like the regular cucumbers I put beside them, but they also didn't produce even a third as many cucumbers.  I was not overly impressed with this seed.
1,Do not buy. Toro will not service. I have had it stop working several times and being familiar with things like this I was able to repair it myself several times. Replace burnt out switch in handle etc. Now after a couple of years it is finished. Need new motor and Toro will not sell me one.
1,This thing is a piece of junk. I don't know what I was expecting for the price. I checked to make sure the top was securely fastened and tossed it into the pool. It was only a 2 foot drop, but the Chlorine Dispenser somehow landed on it's side and dumped the entire contents of the dispenser into my pool. What a joke.
1,I bought this flag in September 2015 and the threads at the bottom started coming out shortly after hanging. I was able to trim them off, but  now, June 2016,  the flag has a 2" deterioration tear at the side diagonal from the stars.  This has been flown every day in Florida, but the winter sun/weather shouldn't have been a factor.  Most other flags have a different style pole and attachment -- metal clasps -- so I will probably have to get a whole new flag and pole.  Which brings another problem of the flag holder which is a bear to attach to my garage stucco.  This flag has had such great reviews ... maybe I just got one from a bad batch.
1,Followed the instructions, and the squirrels were back in force. Why spend hundreds of dollars making the yard tidy and inviting only to be wrecked in 5 minutes by these tree rats. Cheaper to use black pepper and cayenne pepper mix and is more effective.
1,I bought this so I could give my hens ACV in their water. The metal one I had was great but the ACV ruined it.	The lid does not feel secure when you put it on and worse of all it leaks water when it's hanging and fills with shavings when it's on the ground.	Now I have to build a platform that is perfectly level.	Not happy with this!
1,1% seed 99 % filler and "fertilizer" Read carefully. You are paying 9 bucks for 1 % of 32 oz of material. .32 oz of seed if my math is correct.
1,It did not work on my gardenia tree as the label stated. Lousy product.  It is going to die and this product did not help a bit.  I have used other Miracle-Gro products, but this one is an insult.
1,Not what I expected.  The material is more like hair net than tennis net or netting for fencing very thin material.  Material is as thin as sewing thread.
1,I find it hard to believe that this package is OEM quality,  I guess you get what you pay for.	I bought a full Stens branded package and I was a lot more impressed with the quality.
1,i dug down to the main runs, still no luck. used 4 packs, 16 bombs, and it had no effect. that gopher was still busily digging. my wife set a trap and had the goher in 3 hours.
1,Batteries don't last and get hot
1,This pressure gauge worked a couple times and now the dial never goes below 20 psi.  I do not recommend this water pressure gauge.  I bought a better one from Watt's.  That one works correctly.		Valterra on their own did contact me and asked if they could send a replacement.  It did take them two tries (as they sent the wrong one the first time) but I do have a replacement.  I will have to try it to see if it works.  Thing is I bought a much more expensive Watts pressure monitor when this did not work so I really don't need this any more.  But if it works and stays working I will change my rating.
1,Do not buy if you have allergies. Horrendous smell.  I had to water it down because I could not breathe.  My dog refused to go on the treated area.  Never again. No residual effect.  Says to use as needed every 2-4 weeks!  Really expensive for having to use so often, and did nothing in the few hours it was on my lawn.  I would return it if my husband hadn't used the whole bag.  Total waste of money.
1,Very sharp but handles are very small.  I am a woman with small hands, and they are too small for my hand.
1,This said it would fit my filter but it did not
1,Was unusable out of the box! No cord connecting umbrella to crank. Immediately returned.
1,In my one attempt to use it, it did not much of anything.  I did better just using the pressure washer nozzles.  I am going to try again, but I fear that this was a waste of money.
1,Squirrels laugh at this stuff. Sprayed and then watched the squirrels still come up to my porch. Did this several times and still no luck
1,These traps don't seem to work very well. Very dissapointed.
1,Stopped working after 5 minutes. I sent it back
1,Doesn't work. I installed this meter to receive feedback on the amount of water I was using on my orchids. The gage has never moved from 0.0. A total waste of money.
1,OK pump, but the wand is too wimpy for the heavy nozzle so it whips around all over.  Also the nozzle is really really bad.  I don't like any of the settings (spit, pour, leak, and clean-your-driveway jet).		Shame on RoundUp, I thought they'd make a good product.  Save your money and buy the $10 Chapin sprayer with the twist nozzle that works much better.
1,Works as expected.  No clear instructions but my husband was able to figure it out.		Update:  just quit after 6 months!  I'll have to dismantle disappearing fountain to see if it can be fixed but what a hassle!  I wouldn't buy this pump again.
1,seeds never grew
1,Looks nice, but the birds don't seem to like it had to return it
1,Revised after use, it leaks. Some days it's ok, other like the past 2 leaks out within hours.
1,They send it in the original box but don't check to see if everything is up to par.  One side works well but the other side of the grill sucks and won't even hold the grill in placedon't buy this piece of China Made CRAP!
1,We have lots of mice around that get into unwanted places.  Not knowing which no-kill mice traps work best, I decided to get a couple of three different models and try them out together in different locations to evaluate effectiveness before buying more.  Over a period of a couple months I compared the Mouse Hotel, the Kness Trip-trap and the Mice Cube, setting each per the instructions and checking at least morning and evening.	Of the three, the Mouse Hotel caught the most mice by far.  The mice also seemed to be the least stressed.  No mice died in the Mouse Hotel.  This appeared to be because it is the roomiest and they can move around.  It also has a bait holder which they can feed from without making a big mess.  The one problem it has is with the trip floor limiter, which is just a thin plastic tab.  It broke off on one of the traps while a mouse was inside.  The last mouse may have chewed it off but at any rate I found it broken after catching a few mice which renders the trap unusable.  This is a design weakness.  Plan for a limited lifespan of these traps.		The second most effective was the Trip-trap, but it suffers from a couple of serious shortcomings.  If you don't check it every couple of hours expect to find dead mice.  They seem to panic in these and even if found alive they are usually covered in urine, bait and appear really haggard.  The traps are so confining that the mice cant turn around.  Also, I often find this trap tripped with no mice caught.  If they brush against the legs of the door, which they often do in the dark, the trap can close with no mouse inside.  It helps to weight it so it doesnt trip so easily.		The least effective was the Mice Cube.  Not a single mouse was caught with these traps.  None would enter.
1,I planted these and nothing grew. I followed the direction like suggested and everything. I wish I could get a refund
1,We purchased these a while back for smaller birds.  While it did attract the smaller birds, they landed only to knock all of the seeds out of the very small feeding area onto the ground.  They would then eat off the ground (even the snow).  One broke fairly quickly.  We stopped using them and purchased a hanging plastic domed open feeder and a hanging large square open feeder (with a screened bottom).  We know get a wide variety of big and small birds.  They all eat in the feeders.
1,Had this on for a month and it has tons of moths in it. I made attempt to return it and learned  that  despite it being a PRIME item it is sold by someone else and there's a 20% restocking  fee. Very disappointed and still getting bit.
1,Over priced!!!!  I love BBQ and I love flavor.  But this product is overpriced for what it adds to the bbq.
1,bought 10/2016, had one fire a week, thing is rotted top, screen fell apart, top handle came off in a month, i just threw away thinking i had it 2 yrs , but in looking at my amazon orders found didn't last a year. not ez to put together, and to have it dissolve so quickly.,poor quality ,wheels and bottom frame stayed ok but rest junk.after 4 months screen broken was going to buy new wire but felt wasn't worth it as frame rusting away also.in my recollection i haven't bought anything that dissolved so quickly.		ing in years that lasted so poorly.
1,DO NOT BUY! This looks and sounds good--made of brass, etc. But it's a piece of junk. It leaks horribly and, unfortunately, not where the hose is attached. This makes it impossible to repair the leak. After only about six uses, the leak became so bad that the entire mechanism will no longer work (it stopped moving along its axis). I tried to return it because it doesn't work, but  since I ordered it in March (We had a ton of rain until recently and I've only begun using it this month), Amazon won't let me return it. Surely Rain Bird could do better for consumers...what a ripoff!
1,none sprout
1,I had issues with the mower and called to get help but was NOT helped and was on my own after purchasing it. I would stay clear of the product.
1,I live in Maryland and I don't know what kind of ants we have,,only that we have ALOT.	Apparantly they are not Carpenter ants.	My ants did not even touch Maxforce....	I did find TERRO ant killer at the local hardware store and the results were instant.	At least feeding,they swamped the Terro gel,	I will update if it actually kills them,,,
1,I'm a disappointed in this item because you really need to replace both the supply and the return on the models that I have seen with the primer bulb. They are two different sizes. This has only the one larger hose for the primer bulb. What really bugs me is that I bought a kit a few years back with both hoses for the same amount of money.  It was kind of my own fault because I didn't look close enough, but still why sell only one hose when you need two?
1,Not much compost for the price D:
1,What a Shame.  It worked great for two months, and then it quit working.  I replaced batteries about every 3 weeks.  It's a really neat idea, but it's not much good if it doesn't work.
