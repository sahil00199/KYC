0,I know this is suppose to be the end but I really hope not.  I enjoyed this series so much.  Every release led me waiting for the next one.  Emily Trent you made my favorite list for 2013!
0,I enjoyed this book. Good story and well written.
0,Nobody writes dirty talking heroes like Tessa Bailey and this hits it right on the head. Not to mention I always love to see a little bit more of character I fell for in other books :)
0,I'd never run across a character that could do what Monique could do. that was an interesting concept. It certainly added a different flair to things.		I did feel like the story should have ended halfway through and a second book started. Either that or the one  chapter not been ended with such finality.		It was a good story though.
0,I received this book from the author for an honest review.  The first two stories are shorts, one of which I had read before in another of her books as she expanded on it.  The last story was by far my favorite and introduces us to characters and a story line that I immediately fell in to.  I am more curious now to see if this turns into a Beauty and the Beast type story or everyone dies drama.... it really could go either way and knowing some of the author's books already I wouldn't be surprised with either!  In a few short stories we see the depth of the worlds that she creates, her descriptive writing leaves no doubt as to how the story will unfold.  You will be held captive albeit briefly until the end.  Well done and I can't wait to read the second one!
0,This is a new author for me.  I loved this book and am eager to read the entire series!  Cass and James are an unlikely couple who meet by chance.  James takes fa tie into his own hands to put them back in the same place at the same time.  I really enjoyed both characters in this book, as well as Cassidy's brother and James' cousin. They all made the book great.  Highly recommended!
0,I enjoyed this book and was happy this was a standalone!! Champion was a spoiled naive brat. Jax was grimy and so was Denise. I loved me some Mitch and I'm glad him and Destiny ended up together.
0,This book had me hooked again. There are some minor holes but the dark live story is compelling. I'm moving right on to the next book to see what unfolds. Nice change from my usual reads.
0,THIS BOOK WAS GREAT.  I LOVED IT AND AM VERY VERY EXCITED FOR THE SECOND ONE AND CAN'T HARDLY WAIT FOR IT.  I REALLY LOVED THIS BOOK IT IS A FANTASY ROMANCE WITH ADVENTURE AND BATTLES.  THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY GOT ME WAS HOW IT ENDED. IT LEFT YOU KIND OF HANGING.... WAITING FOR THE SECOND BOOK.  WHICH IS NOT OUT YET.
0,Good in a familiar, I know exactly what I'm getting way.
0,Loved the plot and characters. It is great to see others from previous books written into each story line. In places the details do make the story drag some but overall it is good. A another must read from Evangeline Anderson.
0,This installment in the Russell-Holmes series scratched long-held Holmesian itches I wasn't even aware of having.  Haven't you idly wondered, at some time over the years, about the curious tone of the relationship between Holmes and Mrs. Hudson, especially in the Baker Street years?  And perhaps you've wondered how Holmes made the transition from what had to be a conventional upbringing for a boy of his class and time to being that unique creature, a consulting detective?		I must admit, I found the first 20% or so of this book a bit of a slog, but once it opens up and gets moving, it's a wild ride.  King obviously delights in surprising Russell, and us, with Mrs. Hudson's story  -- and that slightly puckish pleasure led her to craft the most charming ending imaginable to this book.		But it's no piece of fluff  --  this is no "Pirate King," it's a good, solid novel of the kind fans are addicted to.  While less of a classic mystery than we are accustomed to, and more of a Greek tragedy, its unfolding is gripping, and Holmes and Russell provide the usual insight and derring-do.  This is definitely not "The Moor or "Justice Hall," but it's a wonderful addition to the Second Canon!
0,Great
0,Very entertaining. I adore Justinia and Harry! These are fully formed characters who foil each other well. The plot was a bit slow and then suddenely very action packed. I look forward to reading more adventures of Justinia - and Harry.
0,Justified is Lisa and Marc's story, we meet them in the Jaded series.  The characters drew me into their heartfelt, steamy read, and I devoured their story.  I love that we get to see past characters in the books.  This is a great series!
0,Productivity Hacks Revealed		  I give this a 5* Review.  A bit of a different take or look on the things that cause stress. Enhanced stress that cause reactions physically like the feelings of depression, anxiety.  The author states the very serious physical and emotional effects from stress and the triggers that cause it for your life. There are examples to clarify or identify what the author is expressing. Did you know stress can cause your brain to shrink!! It speaks to the damaging effects of stress from childhood and how it can be passed on. There is clinical information. Journal quotes, results of clinical research studies. Explains disorders associated with stress. How it can hinder your social life. It gives symptoms of things many experience. Delves into coping mechanisms, journaling, healthy eating, proper rest. Well this is chock filled with identifying where you may be with stress, and it is a good tool to start a journey to wholeness. Great read, written very well, easily understood.
0,Love Jake and Brianna story.  Another good story but to short, want more story in the next book.  Waiting for next STORM book.
0,Sugar addiction is greatly overlooked by most of people in spite of the fact that it is a very common problem.	This book could be an eye opener for people that have struggled with the sugar addiction their whole life and didn't even know about it.	When you understand how bad is sugar addiction, you will think twice about putting that extra sugar in your drink.	It's not too hard to give up sugar; you just need to get organized in what you are eating.	This book contains realistic steps to take to get rid of this addiction.		After reading this book I feel more educated on the food choice decisions I make. This is a great value book and I highly recommend it.
0,I loved this book. It was different than the other books about a royal prince getting a girl pregnant. It is very well written & I got lost in the world that Avery Wilde created. The characters in the book have many layers to them. The more you read the more complex the characters become. I read her book Bad Boys Weeding & loved that one too! She is an excellent writer.		I loved how Prince Andrew Arlington & Keira Valencia met! She really intrigued him from the start. She liked him for himself not being the prince because she did not know who he was & she ran the other way when she found out! I loved that part! He regretted letting her go & did not know her last name so he would not be able to find her anyway. She ends up working at the palace where he lives & he thought he could treat her like all the other girls he slept with! I love how she puts him in her place! I laughed, cried & rejoiced in this book! I recommend this book if you want to read a love story that is not to sugary sweet. It is a steamy read but not over the top also!
0,Cute short story. I have come to really like the characters and can't wait to see what Mark has in str
0,18 yr old maddy wanted one thing for her bday that was handsome sexy  Luc ....she got what she wanted but at a price.. Now yrs later she has successful thriving business  but with Luc on her mind all these yrs  she need to purge him from her brain. So she returns back home to Vegas got get revenge but Luc has other plans... This story was so awesome. I loved the chemistry between the characters the plot I couldn't put the book down...
0,Read the first book (terrific, by the way) and was looking forward to the 2nd.  Wasn't disappointed.  A fast read, well written.  Read it in one sitting and am looking forward to the 3rd.
0,This is the first review for this series. As soon as I read ongoing wanted to read the next. This is the best series I have read in years. Idolize witch especially and sharpshooter you need to read this.	I also learned so much about West Point.  I hope there are more books coming soon. there are plenty of surprises in each book.
0,Being a career adviser, I know how important this book is for the students and grads. Why study Environmental Science? Answers are in the book but I can say with 100% conviction that you will not be disappointed by buying this book. In fact, many college students change their majors and it simply wastes their time (and of course their parents' money). If you buy this book, you will be able to save thousands of dollars for your parents in tuition fees. Graduating months earlier means you will have more opportunity. I read chapters by chapters and found all the chapters very insightful. Look at the universities - all the professors come from top universities, and they offer very insightful tips. Trust me - Environmental Science for the curious is a must-read book for the students and people who are undecided about their career options.
0,Good read. No bad language and no sexual descriptions.  Told the story with class and gift of words. Interesting read.
0,Have no had a chance to read this one yet.  But if it is anything like the other Peppers book I know I will love it.
0,LOVE it
0,Anna Hackett delivers again with the story of Callum and Daniela. These two steam up the jungle even more as they search for the cintamani.
0,I LOVED this book ! I was completed hooked from the start.  I normally have a hard time following books that bounce between past and present.  However, Isabelle made the transition so seamless.		This book has everything I love in a book, it's got a great balance of angst, heartbreak, laughter and love .  I can't wait to get my hands on the second book
0,*4.5 stars*		Dont put yourself out there, and you won't get hurt.		A mantra that Sterling and Ruthie live by until finding each other and realizing that maybe love is worth the risk		Sterling is a Navy SEAL and proud of it. Despite his past, the military, his chosen brothers, and his MC family allowed him to gain the confidence and life he wanted, that he deserved. Ruthie was trying to leave her past behind, continue to live her life peacefully and mindfully though it wasn't getting any easier. While very different people they cant help the attraction they feel for each other though neither wants to admit at first that they could or should deserve each other, love.		The chemistry between these two is unmistakable though their wariness is understandable. Sterling and Ruthie, in their own ways, are tough yet easily hurt so their crusty exteriors are not a surprise. They circle around each other, almost afraid to hope that what is happening between them could be real. And when protective meets independent you know there will be sparks flying right, left and centre! They are good together, and for each other, though it will take some time and events to show both of them that truth		I admit the start was a bit slow but as usual I was not disappointed! There were some interesting twists to this story. I shouldnt be surprised by that, this series has never been predictable. This one, though, seemed to find my heart and just keep squeezing. Whether the past not wanting to leave either of these two behind or unexpected plot turns, this one had me reaching for the Kleenex more than once. A love story that I quickly got caught up in and characters that, once again, remind me why I love this authors writing so much!		Favourite random quotes:	Beards render birth control invalid.	Sometimes I want to rub Sterlings beard like my lucky rabbits foot.		**Reviewed for Nerdy, Dirty & Flirty**
0,I found the writer imaginative and somewhat creative. Her sense of humor is a little too entitled and immature for my taste. My  millenial	granddaughter might enjoy it more. I did laugh out loud a couple of times.
0,Caught my attention from the beginning, really look forward to how the story grows and seeing how the characters choices influence the story!
0,I love reading this authors books.  There's always a good story line.
0,OMG I love the start of this new series!!!! This book was super intense and filled with so much intrigue that I couldn't put it down. There was no cliff hanger per say but you can see this can go so many directions that it's like a cliff hanger just to see where we go next. The alpha males are like uber alphas that are yummy and scary all at the same time! Love Love Love!!!!!!!
0,Have you ever been in a situation, or worse, in a relationship, where you didn't feel like anything you did was good enough? Where no matter how much you tried to fit in or how much you attempted to be that person nothing worked? It's no fun. And that's Aubry. Loud and boisterous, she cracks yo-mama jokes and is chronically late to everything, including church. She's also hiding a tremendous amount of pain and guilt from her past.		"People dressed up hurt in all sorts of ways. Dresses and heels, a grin and witty words didn't mean it wasn't simmering under the surface, ready to explode..."		None of that matters to Pastor Gabe, who finds Aubry refreshing and honest, and has loved her for the past two years. When he finally woos her to move past friends, certain members of his church force him to choose between staying at the church or loving Aubry.		The underlying theme shines throughout this book like a lighthouse on a foggy night. Aubry didn't have to change for Pastor Gabe to love her anymore, just like we don't have to change for God to love us anymore. He loves us exactly as we are, where we are, even if we have a past we're ashamed of.		I read Hope Under Mistletoe and loved it, so I was excited to snatch up another book by Jessica R. Patch. I love how she writes grace into her stories using real-to-life characters and witty dialog without being preachy. Just the Way You Are is a quick read, a wonderful book for a lazy weekend afternoon. I'm definitely a new fan!		Disclaimer: I received this novella free by signing up for Jessica's Patched In newsletter. I received no compensation for my fair and unbiased review.
0,Everything about this book was super adorable! It was a short read, but that made me like it even more!		It was nonstop cuteness on every page. Sarah is a mismatched, misunderstood woman. She's mismatched because she's misunderstood by the men who seem to dump her. But she's my kind of woman: smart, confident, sassy, and over the top. Because she could be classified as high-maintenance, she has resigned to settling for the safe man. So she learns to ride a bike, which I think is completely admirable considering what she went through as a child.		Chris was a heartbroken loner. I loved him almost as much as I loved Sarah. Chris is grumpy and hell bent on not falling in love, no matter what. He's strong and doesn't want to put up with anyone's crap. He doesn't want to get walked over again and is reluctant to be with someone.		Their budding romance was a quirky ride. I adored the two of them together. And honestly, they sort of reminded me of my relationship with my boyfriend. Except he's Sarah and I'm not Chris but I am in many ways. The chemistry flew the moment Sarah walked into the bike shop.		I've read another book by Dade and wasn't super impressed. This one though, I really enjoyed! I just might have to give her another shot!
0,The book had you entertained though out the story to the end so you had to keep reading to the end of the book.
0,This book was well written and carried my interest through the whole thing.  This book holds true to the old saying "opposites attract".  It was a heartwarming story.  The author does a nice job of weaving the history of the main characters life so you understand what.made them tick.  I really don't have anything I could criticize about this story.  I enjoyed it.  I didn't award it 5 stars because it isn't really the type of book you will remember much past the few hours it takes to read.  Still, it is a nice way to spend a few hours.k
0,I absolutely love this series and the Author I find myself ready for the next redirection done with one. A must read
0,Eagerly awaiting the third installment in this series.  Sooooo good but I shouldn't be surprise because Donna McDonald is awesome.  All her books are great!
0,Wow...one of my FAVORITE C.M. STEELE books ever!!! Hot hot hot!!! Anything with this authors name on it this ***SEXY*SIREN*** will gladly buy it!!! Gimmmmeee more PLEASE!!!
0,Love Ms Youngs stories!
0,I finished this book in record time. I was happy to be reading the second book in the series since the first one was so great. I thought TJ's way of finding a woman to marry and have his child might have worked if he had just picked the right women to interview. But I guess the right women might not have applied.	Anna applied to get access to money for unselfish reasons. But she did quickly changed her mind when she found out about the whole baby thing. Unfortunately, TJ didn't change his mind about wanting Anna. Well, maybe that should be "fortunately."	You will learn some things about Anna's past that will be hard to hear. TJ will discover that he still believes in love, and that money is not the answer to everything. Enjoy.		I received an ARC of this book in return for an honest review.
0,Well here is another chick that is just plain money hungry, when  She feels like her boyfriend can not give her what she wants she goes for a man with more money ,well  be careful what you ask for
0,Picky beta readers would have noticed all of missed placed words.  The "wrong" words took the enjoyment of the marvelous story down a level or two.
0,As Zero finally breaks free of his world he is amazed at what the Elites have kept from them...the author is also starting to let the reade see the massive differences in what is basically a caste system...we finally get to see what the role of women are in this world, and watching Zero discover them is hilarious!! One more book to wrap it all up...hope it is as good as they have been!
0,I know there are a lot of alpha books out there but this one tell a good tale. Intrigue and excitement makes you keep on reading while it takes you through the story I give it a plus.
0,An excellent example of first person present writing which I typically don't care for. A very professional job with believable dialogue. Just the right length, fast paced with little narrative. The "victim" is far more than a cutout, single dimensional figure, having had a rather interesting lifestyle.		You'll enjoy this book. I guarantee it!
0,I enjoyed this book as the sequel, to find out more about the characters.  I wasn't disappointed.
0,Debut. Good?? yep bloody good. Crunchy, punchy, unusual writing style. I liked it. Good plot and our hero Harkness will go on from here, strength to strength. Reviews seem sometimes to me like a rewrite of the novel in question. All we really need to know is the bottom line. Good, bad or indifferent. In this case I repeat myself, good? yep bloody good !!!
0,It's feels good to finish this book. It's about friends, love and happy endings. This book shows you that through all love and faith is what carry us through it all. Looove this book. I received a free advance readercopy of this book in exchange for an honest & unbiased revie
0,I really enjoyed it!
0,Noah and Adrian are a couple of guys that I couldn't imagine being together until I realized that yes, they do have some things in common. Most specifically, a love of video games. I must admit, that THERE was the hook that made me want to read this series as I hadn't really seen it as a theme in the genre yet. And the idea of a staid, stuffy professor that works at an ultra-conservative religious institute reluctantly pairing up with a (on the outside at least) young, happy-go-lucky video game developer sounded interesting.		The setup on this story actually worked for me, more-so because I've been to Utah, Colorado, and Los Angeles, so it became very easy for me to imagine this reluctant road trip. And the fact that Adrian meets the guy who leaves him, minus ALL his belongings: no shoes, wallet, coat - what a jerk! Then you find out Adrian has only JUST met the guy in person on this RV trip, and gets abandoned with his sweet little dog with him, but thought he KNEW this guy, because Adrian is the 'master' of long distance relationships? Good grief. He's been 'dating' the jerk that left him via email for six months. And Adrian's tendency to pick long distance relationships comes up later. That, and the fact he feels like the black sheep in his family of successful doctors and lawyers all give us better picture why Adrian seems to continually self-sabotage himself.		Noah, the professor? Well he's a SERIOUS closet case. And I felt so sad for him because he really had himself convinced he didn't deserve happiness, including the white picket fence, marriage partner, 2.0 kids and a dog. It's like his whole life he has felt the need to punish himself as he hears the voice of his judgmental father in his head daily, after he was 'found out' as an impressionable teen with magazines under his mattress. And then he just assumes the rest of his family feels the same, so locks it all away inside, afraid to even visit his sister or mother in the Carolina's because he's sure they'll 'see'.		I enjoyed the gaming theme and appreciate how the author worked the video games into this series. The gamer talk and the way playing the video games became an icebreaker in different scenarios was refreshing and a new twist on an old subject, this one being more of a May-December romance. And, interestingly enough, the young/older partnership worked well here due to the level of maturity and desire to settle down with a family of his own that each Adrian and Noah both had in common, even though it took forever for them to get to the point where they realized the other person wanted the same as him!		To address the audiobook, I have to say that Sean Crisden is always a dependable go-to narrator for me. Nothing overly exciting, but pleasant to listen to. The only thing I wish had been a bit more emphasized was the Carolina accent of Noah. If I'd been reading the story, I'd have heard him differently, whereas Sean basically had him sounding more mature, but not southern.		And as for the cover, I guess I wish the publisher had done something more creative with the faded pinkish/purple photography, and played on the video games theme, as the covers in this series don't look overall very interesting to me. They look faded and dated. But the story inside is a jewel and I can imagine myself relistening to this series. I enjoyed this book, and the next very much, and already have audiobook 3 on preorder!		If you love geeks of a different flavor getting together, family, dogs, road trips and soul-searching in your romance, I think you'll love this series. Despite the bits of angst, this was a fun story, and I'm going to be rereading this one for sure. Definitely worth checking this author out. Highly recommended!
0,Wow! It takes about 2 seconds to fall in love with Rosa! Then you add in her instant family. This is so well written that you would think that they had been role playing forever. Wish there was a sequel would love to see Rosie and her mommy and daddy in every day life.
0,I haven't read a historic romance in a long time and this story just got me hooked again. Good read.
0,I enjoyed this book very much and I can't wait to read other by this author.  This is a story about a little girl who is engage to a man who is older than her in the old days this was common  She grows up  and everything in her life changes.  I recommend this book to anyone who loves to read.
0,What I appreciated most about this work is that it is well-written, unlike too many others on the subject.  For people familiar with the current minimalist writers it won't add much new information, but it is a good review of approaches to the subject.
0,Such a sweet story about finding ones way in life and learning to stand up for what is most important to them. This entire series has been a delight to read so far and I can not wait to read more about the lives of the characters at Twin Moon Ranch.
0,I have been waiting for Gavin's story from the beginning, and it did not disappoint!!!!	My favorite in the series!!!!
0,A very good precursor on the early years of Colonel Ed Stalker of The Empire's Corps. The events that brought him to his present-day mind set.  His course through the Corp. Well written and executed.
0,I've finished the first and second books in the series, and am hoping there will be many more.  I can already see that previous characters could be involved in future mysteries, and can't wait for more!
0,This book gives great detail on types of tanks, set up and working the system to be able to grow not only your vegetation but your fish as well, each benefiting the other. A good read and very informative. I like this as a concept and while I have not yet implemented it, this book definitely provides a good beginners perspective and a lot of information to start with when considering setting up an aquaponics garden situation.
0,Whilst I love murder mysteries, I'm not interested in senseless descriptions of violence.  This one manages to draw the reader into a murderous situation via a series of incidences that are described in a way that is in large measure indirect and thus leaves out unnecessary gruesome details.  This book is hard to put down because the characters are so enjoyable. The author very cleverly describes just enough of the main ones to feel you know them a little and little enough of the others to make you want more.  The hero is inept enough to make him genuinely lovable and believable.  A great balance. The style is a bit like Janet Evanovich only set in San Diego.  The story contains its share of evil but is dealt with in a way which reassures me that good is in greater supply.  An easy reading style that will keep you entertained til the last page. I thoroughly recommend it.
0,With many books, translations are negligible, with two obvious exceptions, one is the Bible, and surprisingly the other is The Iliad. Each translation can give a different insight and feel to the story. Everyone will have a favorite. I have several.		For example:		"Rage--Goddess, sing the rage of Peleus' son Achilles,	Murderous, doomed, that cost the Achaeans countless losses,	hurling down to the House of Death so many souls,	great fighters' souls. But made their bodies carrion,	feasts for dogs and birds,	and the will of Zeus was moving towards its end.	Begin, Muse, when the two first broke and clashed,	Agamemnon lord of men and brilliant Achilles."	-Translated by Robert Fagles, 1990		"Sing, O Goddess, the anger of Achilles, son of Peleus, that brought countless ills upon the Achaeans. Many a brave soul did it send hurrying down to Hades, and many a heroes did it yield a prey to dogs and vultures for so were the counsels of Zeus fulfilled from the day on which the son of Atreus, king of men, and great Achilles first fell out with one another."	-Translated by Samuel Butler, 1888		"Rage:	Sing, Goddess, Achilles' rage,	Black and murderous, that cost the Greeks	Incalculable pain pitched countless souls	Of heroes into Hades' dark,	And let their bodies rot as feasts	For dogs and birds, as Zeus' will was done.	  Begin with the clash between Agamemnon--	The Greek Warlord--and godlike Achilles."	-Translated by Stanley Lombardo, 1997		"Anger be now your song, immortal one,	Akhilleus' anger, doomed and ruinous,	that caused the Akhaians loss on bitter loss	and crowded brave souls into the undergloom,	leaving so many dead men--carrion	for dogs and birds; and the will of Zeus was done.	Begin it when the two men first contending	broke with one another--	the Lord Marshal Agam&eacute;mnon, Atreus' son, and Prince Akhilleus."	-Translated by Translated by Robert Fitzgerald, 1963		"Sing, goddess, the anger of Peleus' son of Achilleus and its devastation, which puts pains thousandfold upon the Achains,	 hurled in the multitudes to the house of Hades strong souls of heroes, but gave their bodies to be the delicate feasting of dogs, of all birds, and the will of Zeus was accomplished since that time when first there stood the division of conflict Atrecus' son the lord of men and brilliant Achilleus."	-Translated by Richmond Lattimore, 1951		"Sing, goddess, of Peleus' son Achilles' anger, ruinous, that caused the Greeks untold ordeals, consigned to Hades countless valiant souls, heroes, and left their bodies prey for dogs or feast for vultures. Zeus's will was done from when those two first quarreled and split apart, the king, Agamemnon, and matchless Achilles."	-Translated by Herbert Jordan, 2008		"An angry man-there is my story: the bitter rancor of Achills, prince of the house of Peleus, which brought a thousand troubles upon the Achaian host. Many a strong soul it sent down to Hads, and left the heroes themselves a prey to the dogs and carrion birds, while the will of God moved on to fulfillment."	-Translated and transliterated by W.H.D. Rouse, 1950		"Achilles' wrath, to Greece the direful spring	Of woes unnumber'd, heavenly goddess, sing!	That wrath which hurl'd to Pluto's gloomy reign	The souls of mighty chiefs untimely slain;	Whose limbs unburied on the naked shore,	Devouring dogs and hungry vultures tore.	Since great Achilles and Atrides strove,	Such was the sovereign doom,	and such the will of Jove!"	-Translated by Alexander Pope, 1720		"Achilles sing, O Goddess! Peleus' son;	His wrath pernicious, who ten thousand woes	Caused to Achaia's host, sent many a soul	Illustrious into Ades premature,	And Heroes gave (so stood the will of Jove)	To dogs and to all ravening fowls a prey,	When fierce dispute had separated once	The noble Chief Achilles from the son	Of Atreus, Agamemnon, King of men."	-Translated by William Cowper, London 1791		"Achilles' baneful wrath - resound, O goddess - that impos'd	Infinite sorrow on the Greeks, and the brave souls loos'd	From beasts heroic; sent them far, to that invisible cave*	That no light comforts; and their limbs to dogs and vultures gave:	To all which Jove's will give effect; from whom the first strife begun	Betwixt Atrides, king of men, and Thetis' godlike son*"	-Translated by George Chapman, 1616		"The Rage of Achilles--sing it now, goddess, sing through me	the deadly rage that caused the Achaeans such grief	and hurled down to Hades the souls of so many fighters,	leaving their naked flesh to be eaten by dogs	and carrion birds, as the will of Zeus was accomplished.	Begin at the time when bitter words first divided	that king of men, Agamemnon, and godlike Achilles."	-Translated by Stephen Mitchell		"Sing now, goddess, the wrath of Achilles the scion of Peleus,	ruinous rage which brought the Achaians uncounted afflictions;	many of the powerful souls it sent to the dwelling of Hades,	those of the heroes, and spoil for the dogs it made it their bodies,	plunder for the birds, and the purpose of Zeus was accomplished__"	-Translated by Rodney Merrill		"Sing, goddess, the anger of Achilles, Peleus' son,	the accused anger which brought the Achaeans countless	agonies and hurled many mighty shades of heroes into Hades,	causing them to become the prey of dogs	and all kinds of birds; and the plan of Zeus was fulfilled."	-Translated by Anthony Verity		"Of Peleus' son, Achilles, sing, O Muse,	The vengeance, deep and deadly; whence to Greece	Unnumbered ills arose; which many a soul	Of mighty warriors to the viewless shades	Ultimately sent; they on the battle plain	Unburied lay, to rav'ning dogs,	And carrion birds; but had Jove decreed,"	-Translated by Edward Smith-Stanly 1862		"Sing, goddess, of the anger of Achileus, son of Peleus, the accrued anger which brought uncounted anguish on the Achaians and hurled down to Hades many mighty souls of heroes, making their bodies the prey to dogs and the birds' feasting: and this was the working of Zeus' will"	-Translated by Martin Hammond		"Sing, Goddess of the rage of Achilles, son of Peleus-	that murderous anger witch condemned Achaeans	to countless agonies and threw many warrior souls	deep into Hades, leaving their dead bodies	carrion food for dogs and birds-	all in the fulfillment of the will of Zeus"	- Translated by Professor Ian Johnston, British Columbia 2006		"The rage, sing O goddess, of Achilles, son of Peleus,	The destructive anger that brought ten-thousand pains to the	Achaeans and sent many brave souls of fighting men to the house	of Hades and made their bodies a feast for dogs	and all kinds of birds.

Powell		"Sing, goddess, the wrath of Achilles Peleus' son, the ruinous wrath that brought on the Achaians woes innumerable, and hurled down into Hades many strong souls of heroes, and gave their bodies to be a prey to dogs and all winged fowls; and so the counsel of Zeus wrought out its accomplishment from the day when first strife parted Atreides king of men and noble Achilles."	- Translated by Andrew Lang, M.A., Walter Leaf, Litt.

Another translation is by Ennis Samuel Rees, Jr. (March 17, 1925 - March 24, 2009) More in the line of poetry.		Another translation is by Thomas Starling Norgate 1864. Dramatic blank verse.		Another translation is by Theodore Alois Buckley 1873. Literal prose with explanatory notes.		Another translation is by Arthur Sanders Way 1882.		There are so many lesser known translations that they cannot fit in this review. However they are worth searching for. Most now days are just OCR reprints.		-----------------------	  Greek Latin	  ----- -----	  Zeus. Jupiter.	  Hera. Juno.	  (Pallas) Athene. Minerva.	  Aphrodite. Venus.	  Poseidon. Neptune.	  Ares. Mars.	  Hephaestus. Vulcan.		You will find that some translations are easier to read but others are easier to listen to on recordings, lectures, Kindle, and the like. If you do not see information on specific translators, it is still worth the speculation and purchase. Right after the translation readability and understanding, do not overlook the introduction which gives an insight to what you are about to read.		The Stephen Mitchell translation goes though each of the major characters so well that you think you know them before you starts reading. Other introductions explain the struggle between different types of power. Rodney Merrill's 28 page introduction focuses on singing.		The Oxford University Press Barry B. Powell has an extensive introduction with real "MAPS". Also there is information of the finder Schliemann. We even get annotation on the meaning being conveyed.		Our story takes place in the ninth year of the ongoing war. We get some introduction to the first nine years but they are just a background to this tale of pride, sorrow and revenge. The story will also end abruptly before the end of the war.		We have the wide conflict between the Trojans and Achaeans over a matter of pride; the gods get to take sides and many times directing spears and shields.		Although the more focused conflict is the power struggle between two different types of power. That of Achilles, son of Peleus and the greatest individual warrior and that of Agamemnon, lord of men, whose power comes form position.		We are treated to a blow by blow inside story as to what each is thinking and an unvarnished description of the perils of war and the search for Arte (to be more like Aries, God of War.)		<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Troy-The-Director-s-Cut-Blu-ray/dp/B000TGGJKU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Troy - The Director's Cut [Blu-ray</a>]
0,Excellent story in this series.  Each is standalone but a continuing family saga.....  this one is book two. There are about 10 more in the series at 4.00 each.  Just so you know what to expect.
0,A well written story that relates the trek of a few US Army soldiers attempting to get back to Tennessee from Colorado.  And, a stray that hitches a ride in their truck.  There are blood mobs appearing which are destructive to say the very least.		A most poignant scene involves Mr. Flanders, a funeral director, and his wife.  Sometimes life just isn't fair with the ones we love the most.		Lots of grisly scenes and an interesting group in Memphis that have "666" spray painted on the sides of their vehicles.		There is a lot of action and lots to think about and an interesting read.		Highly recommended.
0,I enjoyed the first two books very much. The third book was a little ho-hum.
0,I just love these books. I've left reviews on the earlier ones. But suffice it to say I binge-read the whole series and all are five star reads to me. I can't say more than what I've said before: consistent good writing, great focus on characterization over all else, but even if long-winded, never boring to me. I highly recommend all the books in the series.
0,My favorite of the three books. These are quick hot reads with a great story line to complete it. Danger has come to the quiet town. Will they be able to fight the danger and complete the ceremony to ensure the future of bearkin? Read this series to find out!
0,I just love the Kismet stories. This one is just too funny. A peek into one of the sections with the vamps. I wonder if all of Kismets vamp clients are just as insane as these two. I have read all of the Kismet books and stories and am awaiting more. Please give me more.
0,Wow! Part 2 picks up right where we left off in part 1. This one has a lot more suspense and mystery and your left guessing who the bad guys are, and if there's anyone Nikki can really trust.		Nikki is left reeling and so confused because she's starting to fall for Xavier and doesn't know if he's someone she should even be involved with. She keeps trying to push him away until she pieces the puzzle together but her body keeps betraying her.		Xavier and Nikki have some serious chemistry and Nikki just doesn't know how anyone who can make her feel so good he someone so bad. She's getting closer to the mystery of what happened to her brother but she's putting herself in harms way and seems to be in too deep to stop now.		Part 2 leaves us with another cliffhanger and I can't wait to get part 3 to see who the bad guy is and what this leaves of Nikki and Xavier's relationship. Roxy has you guessing and trying to solve this mystery right along with Nikki and I can't wait to see how it all ends!		~**I received this book as a gift in exchange for a fair/honest review. Reviewer for Bloggin with M. Brennan**~
0,The stories are so well written that the transition from one book just flowed smoothly to the next and when the bad Guy/Gal got theirs. I looked forward to seeing what was going to happen after.
0,WOW!! This book was hot, suspenseful, sweet and exciting all rolled into one.	Fox left Dani the day after her 18th birthday for the army and from there life just spiraled out of control for him. He was picked up by an elite but scary group called Snake Eyes.	Dani aka Roxie , is an actress whose father runs her life and she can't do a thing about it. When Snake Eyes makes a statement on national television , will the person their message is for come help ?	Oh did I mention Fox is "dead"? Yea how do you explain that to your family!	I laughed with this book and my heart hurt for the both of them but I sure LOVED the HEA.		Here's hoping we get to see more about Caleb and Boxcar. What an interesting couple!!	Great read with some hot sex and some violence but nothing awful!!	I was given an ARC in exchange for an honest review.
0,Really enjoyed this mystery.  It didn't seem logical until the end.  A cold-blooded murderer who was difficult to figure why he committed the crimes.		Main character is Ridley who had been a PI in California.  He inherited his parents karaoke bar in Michigan.  His parents were very wealthy and were successful song writers.ridley is single but met up with an old flame.  He also had several interesting high school friends.  All of this comes into play as he attempts to figure who the culprits are.		You will enjoy this action-packed page turner.  Extremely well-written.  Kudos to the author.
0,I really liked this book!  It was very interesting.  I liked the authors other books, so thought I'd try this one, not expecting much, as it was quite a different type of story.  But it was great!
0,The Trouble With Christmas is my first read by Kaira Rouda.  I was impressed with Ms Rouda's well written book.  Lily and Cole's story is an entertaining read.  Ms Rouda has furnished her story with amazing characters, drama, humor and steamy sex.  I enjoyed The Trouble With Christmas and look forward to reading more from Kaira Rouda in the future.  The Trouble With Christmas is book 3 of the Indigo Island Series but can be read as a standalone.  This is a complete book, not a cliff-hanger.
0,I could not wait to get my hands on this book after the "Queen of the Cliffhangers" left me drooling and screaming obscenities after the cliffy in Book One. Just when things were getting super steamy.....BOOM ((Insert TH evil laugh here))		Book Two picks up where Book One left off with Taryn and Hank finally giving in and admitting their feelings for each other, but Mike has feelings too. Mike hasn't had the guts (and/or opportunity) to express his feelings for Taryn. He has come close, but has yet to tell her directly the hold she has over him. It's not until he hears a drunken Gus drawl how he saw Taryn and Hank "deep in conversation" in the alley, that Mike snaps. This could be the one thing that could tear apart the friendship that they have shared for years and shatter his soul. Mike finds comfort in Traci and must face his decisions regarding his best friends, the girl he has loved for as long as he can remember and the girl who picked up the pieces. The fight in the cage is looming ahead and he knows he will face his best friend, yet greatest opponents, Hank and Trenton. Can he get his head back in the Cage?	Find out for yourself! I can't wait for the conclusion to this series!!!
0,4.5 Stars		Warning: this is an epic love triangle story!!	Skye has been with Caleb for several years. He's a safe bet to the life she always planned on for herself. Skye may have sacrificed some of her own dreams for the future but she's confident in her choices because it meant she could fully support Caleb in his career.	Noah is Skye's oldest friend, growing up they were best friends and as a young teen Skye's affections for him turned into a crush. As they grew older and Noah went off to travel the world and Skye went off to college they kept in touch but the distance between them grew. Skye's hope that their relationship would turn into something more was dashed when Noah came to visit her at college and was more interested in sorority girls than her. On this trip he brought Caleb, his new friend, and when Noah is busy trying his luck with other chicks she gets to know Caleb better. And so began their relationship. Years later she and Caleb are still going strong and Noah is still in their life, although now he's more Caleb's friend than hers. But despite how in love with Caleb Skye is, Noah still holds a spot in her heart.	I know love triangles aren't to everyone's taste but I'll tell you why I love them. They bring more feelings and emotions out in me than any other type of story and no matter if those feelings are positive or negative if a book can evoke such strong feelings in you then that is a bloody good book in my view!	This book gave me the double whammy of feels because not only is it a love triangle, it's also a sort of 'One Who Got Away' kind of story, which are the two book themes most guaranteed to get to me and this book had them both!	I did have mixed feelings about Skye but I think most love triangle books make you feel some level of anger towards the person in the middle. I think as women we do judge the female characters more harshly, like there were times I thought Skye was weak and found her inability to just make a decision annoying, but isn't that just an imitation of real life? Because us women do judge other women more harshly, it's in our DNA! But I also somehow managed to understand her on some level, because Skye freely admitted to her weaknesses and there's a certain strength in being able to do that.	This was a great read, full of angst and drama and I believe it showed it's merit that it was able to make me feel strongly, no matter which direction those feelings went. I'd definitely recommend this, and if not for those reasons I've already mentioned then getting to meet Noah is reason enough!
0,Miller definitely is not what I expected after reading about him in Pucked..but I totally fell for him just the same.  Loved the banter between he and Vi - they just cracked me up.  Yet, deep down you know they loved one another and only wanted the best for the other.  And Sunny.....not my favorite heroine, as she did drive me crazy at times.  I understood Miller's frustrations with her and not going after her.  Glad that Sunny was the one to come around and apologize, and show Miller that she loved him as much as he loved her.		I enjoyed book 1 more, but I still enjoyed this one as well.  Looking forward to more of these entertaining characters in the rest of the series!
0,A few days ago, I was still recovering from bronchitis and was stuck in bed.  I happen to see this book on the Amazon top 100 list and the cover caught my interest.  I downloaded a sample to see if I would like it and after I was done with the sample I just had to know what happened next so I bought the book.  From the sample to the actual full book, I just could not put this book down!  I loved the characters and the storyline.  I also appreciated that the language and the romance were clean.  I also liked that the the heroine, Ari, was a strong person.  Some authors have heroines that make lousy decisions, the kind where the reader just wants to slap them upside the head and say what were you thinking?, so that the heroine is put in danger and needs to be rescued by the hero.  This is not the case in this book I am happy to say!	I highly recommend you buy this book.  You will love the characters (Ari, Dean, Hunter, Charity and Will!) and the world they live in!
0,This is a beautiful and sweet reading, really good book!	This story starts with Nina and Isaac. Nina had a poor upbringing, a mother who doesn't care about her, and she suffered all type of prejudice, the people were really cruel to her. Isaac a rich young man were the only person who cares about her, and  he had promised her no matters what they will stay together. But  fate separated them.	Nina is now Irene and nine years after, she can't forget Isaac.	But destiny brings Terrence in her life, a rich man, friendly,and caring ,which  makes her rembembers of Isaac, because they are so similar.	Will Irene gives Terrence a chance and forget about Isaac? Finally will she be able to have her happily ever after?	Start reading now to discover...		Thank you Nadia for the copy provided. Very good writing! Congrats!
0,Another good read from KP Baker I enjoy her knowledge about the game of baseball, and the fun and entertaining way she tells the story.	My Grandkids really liked it!!!!
0,great series
0,Omg I soooooooooo excited to start book 2.. There is gonna be trouble once Hakeem find out babyyyyy.. This book is highly recommended
0,This is a paranormal historical erotic romance. This story of Tarrin before he left Lucia and his daughter, Siana. Tarrin has come to Scotland to save his daughter and the Druid females from the Druid priests.  Book 8 tell the beginning of the role of the Druids and the Dealers, it happen in the last 1800s.  I love it because this book has three of my faves think, romance, paranormal and historical themes.
0,Great Read!!!
0,This is eighth or ninth book I've read by Mr Reed, and I've liked them all. Most frustrating issue is waiting for the follow-up. They are detailed, with interesting characters and realistic dialogue. These two books remind me a little of L E Modesitt, without the magical stuff.
0,All the books in this series were entertaining and the character development continued through all seven books. I enjoyed reading this series and look forward to more by this author.
0,I really liked this book. It was fast to read through and I was able to download the applications while reading it. I have already earned $10.00 and a lot of bonuses that will help me get more money. I downloaded this book to my kindle app so it will be easy to reference back to pages.		* I received this product for free/discounted in exchange for an honest review*
0,This story was very interesting as it dealt with so many pertinent issues of the day with real people.  Thanks
0,These are the only brand I will use.  They give me just what I need and I will continue to use them in the future.
0,Gotta love a small town romance!  I love Zoe York's writing style and how relatable the characters are.
0,I'm really glad I read this story, it was raw, gritty and honest. I know rape and violence is risqu in stories because it is demeaning, however rape does happen. Unfortunately, this story showed how rape is used as a form of humiliation and discipline, but in a way that helps us identify what and how she was feeling. I'm thankful the author didn't skate over it because the story needed that punch for us to see how traumatic her life really was. The author was creative and honest in her story to bring Holly to life as a damaged heroine who turned out to have immeasurable strength. A great story with deep characters.
0,Marilyn Baker shares how she lost 100 pounds eating great tasting "caveman" foods! I have recently read quite a few different life stories on weight loss, this is great, too.	I am always inspired by such success stories which brings others struggling past the thinking it's impossible to lose "my weight", not so. From early in life how being little pudgy angel and all else	through the course of  life that can keep us stuck,  feeling like a disappointment, carrying those things all contribute to poor self image.  The availability of terrible fast food choices but we eat it.	With a change of mind and following up with good choices and a different lifestyle she shows how she did this weight loss. It is well thought out, and I think very encouraging to anyone finding	themselves in this same situation.  Get the book you will find some strength here.  5*****
0,I couldn't put this book down. I normally read romance so I may not be as qualified as others to review this but I loved it. I enjoy stories with smart characters. The creative world the author has produced is intriguing to read about and on that edge of totally believable. I do miss the deeper emotional connection I'm used to getting but I remind myself it's not a romance and it's not like I'm reading about cold fish. The characters do have depth, just not pages of internal monologue.
0,A Bride for Christmas is a short story that is cleverly written.  It immerses the reader in the story and the characters quickly form personalities for you to enjoy.
0,Excellent book. I loved  this book. Every character in this book was very interesting. This book kept me interested from chapter to chapter. I laughed and cried with each character.
0,*I voluntarily read a Review Copy of this book. All opinion stated are solely my own and no one elses*		This was a brilliant read and I thoroughly enjoyed it.		Darius and Regan had great chemistry - I loved the sizzling flames burning wildly between them.  These two made me laugh and smile throughout the entire story.		The plot was intriguing, captivating and gripping.		This was a fantastic Scottish Highland romance and I wouldnt hesitate to recommend it.  This book had everything you would want in a good book: mystery, suspense, action and most importantly an all consuming romance that will leave you feeling tingly everywhere.
0,This was one intriguing and interesting story to read and it kept me reading until the end of this story!!!!!
0,I'm a dating and relationship coach and i wish Krista lived in my town so she could set me up with Mr Right! She will guide you down the path to love with style and a fun writing style. I love the examples of her clients and the big mistakes you don't want to make. But do remember to have fun on your path to love. There is joy in the journey and Krista helps people laugh at the silly things that people do when they are looking for love. And if you want to have EPIC Love, sometimes you've got to have some epically bad dates!
0,Enjoyed a good read. Kept me reading couldn't put down
0,Another great Kane adventure. Can't wait to read his next book!
0,These stories was great entertainment during our camping trip. It made our hair stand up. Why? because it was really creepy when you actually read the story in the woods with the camp fire... This was actually  worth while!
0,Alessandra is at a gala benefit when her bodyguard is shot protecting her.  She hits the road and ends up in Texas, on the run in fear for her life.  She ends up in a truck owned by a former SEAL who takes it upon himself to become her bodyguard.
0,This is a must read. I absolutely believe Robin Covington has outdone herself with this story. Salvation is the second book in the Nashville Nights series (First book is called Temptation). The attraction between the two characters Carlisle and Mateo are off the chart. The story is based on real life events (terrorist attack and the death of a sibling) affecting the characters. The story is both heart-warming and painful. You will need tissues. I enjoyed it immensely and look forward to the next book. I highly recommend this book and if you haven't read Temptation yet, then grab that one too.
0,I have read all of her books and this one doesn't dissapoint. I just hate I have to wait for the next enstallment
0,Great job
0,Pat Simmons' Guily series continues to intrigue and entertain.  Pat has managed to tell a story in A Back Story!  This quick yet thorough story will give you insight into Cameron Jamieson, Malcom and Parke's baby brother.  The story is entertaining and raised my anticipation for the Oct. 1st release of Free From Guilt.  If you are a "Guilty" fan like me you'll get a quick "fix" waiting for the next release in the series.  If you are new to the work of Pat Simmons take a chance, reading this back story will draw you in and you'll be hooked on "The Guilty Series". Download your copy now, you won't be disappointed!
0,Relentless is a well paced, passionate, second chance romance.		I liked how Skye didn't draw out Troy and Giselle's background stories too much.  By knowing where they came from and what they've overcome I felt close to Troy and Giselle, like I really knew them.  They are both strong characters, and the pull between them when they end up being in the same place at the same time is palpable.  The conflict and emotions they go through in Relentless were a roller coaster ride!  Both of them have over come so much, but the past still haunts them each.  Troy has never gotten over Giselle, and his heart ache was very easy to feel through Skye's writing.  He seemed more vulnerable than Giselle, and I really felt for him.  Giselle has her own heart ache, but the choices she made have shaped her present.  As they somewhat reluctantly come together again, there is conflict, tension, and a lot of steam!  I was interested to see how things would turn out for them, and Skye kept me hooked in their very intriguing story.		There is some explicitness to Relentless, and it works well and fits in relevantly with the plot.		The secondary characters all have something to add, and made things even more interesting.		Relentless is part of Renegades series by Skye Jordan, but it can easily be enjoyed as a stand alone.		I'd recommend Relentless to any romance reader who enjoys the bumpy road of a second chance romance.		I received a free copy for an honest review.
0,I'd recommend this book to be read by anyone who enjoys a good adventure to love everlasting.	This story is full of suspense and action. A story of a young boy and girl later falling in love. She's a foundling and he the Laird's son.	I don't want to give more away so I'll stop here.
0,Steamy!! Hot!!! Intense!! Passion!! Fire!!! I actually could feel myself get slightly turned on when  I was reading this book. And just for a slight moment I wished that this could happen to me. Back to reality,..... " Allison" has a tragic past that she's running from. With an extremely past abusive relationship ..how can she open up to " Jackson"... I would like to see where this story goes.
0,This was a quick, happy, read that was just in time for the season.  I read it with delight and would like to see more short stories like this one!
0,Charlie sees something fall from the sky in the woods near her cabin see goes out to investigate and sees a large animal as she watches the animal changes fro.

HRlie, he stays with Charlie a year then she decides to go to the North Pole with him and their. Child.	I've read every book written my ms butler and every one  is better than the last. I view  reading each new book as a vacation into her world of shifters and I treasure my visits there. They are well worth the time I just wish they were longer visits.
0,this is sally Mackenzie at her best. great start to another series thanks
0,This intriguing story has more intwined twists and connections that make each chapter a new mystery.  I read a few pages of the sample and then bought the book. I could hardly put it down till the end.
0,I received this book from a friend on Goodreads and asked to give a review on Daisy McDare.		Well I must say that Daisy is a breath of fresh air. She is cute, smart and always has a cupcake with her to calm her down when she is upset.		She had no problem solving the murder at the restaurant that she was hired to redecorate, which is her main job.		With a little help from a couple of her friends, she gets right to the heart of the crime and gets the killer.		Light, and fast paced it was a quick read for summer.
0,When a book you know is going to gut you ends up in your hands and makes you submit and brings you completely to your knees, hurts your heart, breaks your trust and makes you sob uncontrollable tears. It makes one wonder why do we do this to ourselves? Because when a story this important comes along it demands to be read, and that is what Undo Me by Author M. Robinson does.	There are so many things to say but it would spoil it for you so this is going to be short and to the point.	If you are person that can not handle stories that involve rape, drinking and driving, drug use and domestic violence, this may not be the book for you. BUT I beg you to give it a chance, this story is so much more. There is this amazing story about love that lasts decades, loyalty, support and seeking help when you feel helpless. Those are the things I took from this beautiful, lyrically perfect book.	This is so far in 2016 My TOP READ! It evoked every emotion in me, it made me unable to read for days... NO JOKE and I read at least 3 books a week. This story wrecked me and I LOVED every minute of it.  For something else to come along and top this, it would have to be pretty much "The Perfect Book."
0,Good book, that damn Yuki is crazy ass hell.

0,I was given this book by the author and goodreads LOP group in exchange for an honest review. I was hooked from page one this book has  lots of action, danger, and heat .I really enjoyed following along on Kelly and Jacob's journey and hated it when I reached the end .The chemistry between Kelly and Jacob is off the charts and I quickly became attached to these two  and rooting for them .I was on the edge of my seat the whole way through .This book is such a great read my only complaint is that it ended on a cliff hanger  I want more more more and can't wait to dive into the rest of their story .

0,Love the focus on resolving issues of prejudice and OLD military style management and hierarchy. Well thought out and deserves applause! A bit redundant with all the saluting and medals and shoe shining. But seeing a raise in consciousness is uplifting. It's interesting that the women are not denigrated more as would be a real issue in old world thinking. And with all the interpersonal relationships there should be more intimate connections if not outright sex then more excitement in their interactions. Written almost like a report at times! I stick with it though since I have come to adore the Riss Nation and their aspirations. But need some soulful romance to spice the pot. Not just Sean at port once in a while.	I would really like to see much more of a back story for the three worlds SAS JPN UFN. What are their cultures like? What defines them? Need more details on this. I follow this series with anticipation!
0,I enjoyed the book; especially the twist at the end. I purchased the rest of the series and look forward to see how the author will bring all the characters together in the last book.
0,I thoroughly enjoyed The Ebb, although it is a bit long and drawn out. The back and forth between the two time periods could be confusing at times.
0,Well Done!	The story is not juvenile. It is complex and tied together, like few scifi stories are. The trick that Rob Buckman uses is to tell an exciting action story, with a larger than life hero that has flaws, and work in scifi aspects, grounded in the social political faults of our society, worldwide. Not bad.
0,I fell in love with Mike and Sabrina. They both fought their feelings for each other and tried to pretend they were just friends, but it was easy to tell that it was more. I liked how forgiving Sabrina was, even though she probably shouldn't have sometimes, and hated Mike at times, but I really enjoyed their journey. I am looking forward to the next book in this series. I hope Nick gets his story.
0,This book was surprisingly short, but, really	enjoyed it.  You can never get enough of a nice	love story.  Makes you smile.
0,This book 2 in the series and I am in love with Ari and Chase.		In this installment the author throws the couple curve balls to see if they can overcome them. Watching each character grow, made me feel like I truly knew them. I absolutely love the family and competitiveness they all have. I can't wait to read book 3
0,Omg krystal i loved this book it was everythingm I thought I would hate Saint but his life story kinda softened me. The drama omg was outta this world. Ricque's mam was soo damn evil. Sigh poor London. Loved that little girl and lil Enimen lol. #TeamRicqueandNina
0,Was free :)
0,I got this book under mixed feelings. I am not much into military stories. This was a recommended book to begin a new series with so I said "what could it hurt" as I was looking for something different to read. Well let me say I was pleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed the story. I was actually really involved with each man's story and resulting injuries. It's a great introduction to the series.		I felt the writing was good. It was factual and gave you a good insight into military life in Iraq. I was saddened and cried at each of the men's injury and really felt how painful and utterly disabling each injury was to them.		So please if you have never read military stories(like I haven't) or thought you would be bored with them(like I did) please read this. It will change your mind and possibly open a new avenue to reading choices to you. Trust me you won't be disappointed!!!
0,I have never read a bad one, always enjoy each one!
0,One of the best books out there, let's keep It going just hope earth doesn't get destroyed and we prevail.
0,This is such a cute story. Tiffany  is awsome and the other characters are great. It's a real who dun it ending in a murder mystery party.
0,What an emotional ride this short story is. It started with tears and ended with a smile. A great way to spend an hour or so.
0,The story is just okay, not great. The illustrations show up rather small on my Kindle HD screen. My kids enjoyed it and they liked the video a lot. It is just a YouTube video though so we could have watched it for free. The jokes and games are a little hokey, not that great. I would not recommend buying this book, just search YouTube for the video, it is identical to the story.
0,Awesome book. Can't wait for the next book. Definitely worth buying! Great author, she never ever disappoints.
0,Wow!!!!!! This book kept me on my toes!! I loved all the characters in it!! I loved Taylor and case they were adorable! Amazing book!!!
0,I truly enjoyed this collection of Father Brown stories.  Chesterton writes in the old style reminiscent of Dickens.  This style can be difficult to read for someone who hasn't encountered it before but I really enjoy it. Even though I must consult the dictionary more than I am used to, I get a very satisfied feeling upon completing this type of book.  I shall look for more of his works.
0,Love these stories.  All three of them were really good and I highly recommend them.  I love these types of stories and it is often rare when you find them this good.  You have excitement, fun, surprises, love, suspense and so much more.  What a good surprise these women got.  Hot alpha males and an adventure.  I was given a review copy and voluntarily review it.
0,I enjoyed reading DEAD RUNNING by Cami Checketts. I recommend it to mystery readers.
0,This book is clean and interesting definitely keeps you on edge and the ending is exactly how all holidays should be.
0,This is John Scalzi at his usual pace. Well written. I bought the 5 first chapters but stopped, because it is going to bee too expensive, buing the hole damn thing this way. Am waiting for it to come as a book, before I buy more of it.
0,This was my first Heidi Hutchinson book. I really enjoyed it and plan to read more of her work. The only issue that I really had was the characters age verses their maturity. I would've thought that they were in their late teens, early twenties at the oldest...but otherwise a good read.
0,Saranna DeWylde is a new to me author and I found out after the fact that this is the second in a series.  I haven't yet read the first but will surely do so now.  That being said this book stands on its own well.  I didn't feel as though Id missed anything by not having read Desperate Housewives of Olympus yet.  This is a fun mash up of several pantheons told from several points of view.  I am not normally a fan of that type of storytelling but Saranna DeWylde makes it work.  If you are looking for a fun romantic escape pick up this book.  You won't regret it.
0,Ok... Review time. I loved this book. You see Tug grow so much from the beginning to the end. He learns a lot about himself, love and what caring about someone truly means. Maria has faced so much in her life. It is so nice to see her supported and protected by a good man. The ending is what has me in shock. That is all I will say about it. Expletives were texted to my best book buddy because I was not expecting the book to end the way it did. Worth the read.
0,I received an ARC for my honest review.		This is part 5 of the Wanted Series.  I am totally loving this story.  As Wyatt and Addison continue to fall for each other, we are getting a deeper glimpse of the inward struggles Addison has about love and trust.  It breaks my heart to read about her childhood, but although Wyatt is still in the dark about how she grew up, he is slowly but surely breaking down the walls she has built.  I love his determination and hope to get a glimpse at some of the lyrics he wrote in the song he wrote using Addison as his muse.  I can't wait to read the next "episode" of their hot romance.  This is a must read for everyone!  Highly recommended!
0,I started this book early this morning around 8 am & just now finished it around 7:50 pm.  From the 1st page of Trinity's story to the last page I was sucked into this story & just wanted to read & not stop.  It was fast paced all the way to the end & when I got to the end I was sorry the book was ending because I want to know more about Trinity's Prophecy & what happens to her friends.  I will so definitely be reading the 2nd book.
0,This was the best book yet. Can't wait for the next one. Hurry please.!!!  Would like more on Owen		Donna
0,"One of the most important things I realized was that most everyone was searching for their happily ever after, in books and in real life, but that conclusion was always judged on if the girl got the guy in the end."		Scarlett's statement towards the end of Euphoria epitomizes a lot of romantic readers' viewpoints, and in my opinion, why some readers of this series have a problem with this book. But life is messy and picture perfect endings only happen in fairy tales, and even if this is a fictional world, Erin Noelle stays true to life's reality and provides her readers with a conclusion that proves that life never really turns out how anyone expects.		Butterfly...Angel...two enduring names for the same person, Scarlett, from the two men who own her heart, Ash and Mase. Throughout the series, I didn't really choose a team. Both men brought out different parts of Scarlett; she is so young and has very little experience with life and love, and both Ash and Mase help her to grow into the woman she is at the end of book three. The journey to get Scarlett to love herself and realize her own needs and wants is not pretty. Secrets and betrayals occur that drastically alter the relationships amongst the main characters as well as their lives. No one will be the same due to the events that transpire, but at the end, when everything is all said and done, Scarlet is left with a life that may not have been anything she would have planned for herself, but it's a life that comes from everything she experienced and learned from, and one she wouldn't want to change despite all of the loss and devastation that was endured.		Any book that elicits such high emotional reactions as Euphoria does, in my opinion, is a well written story because it has all the components that draw readers in and allow them to connect with the characters to the point that they feel the same desolation as Scarlett, Ash, and Mase do. No matter what happened in the main characters' relationships or who Scarlett ended up with, half of the readers would not be satisfied. But what it comes down to is the author's vision...it is Erin Noelle's story to tell, and she told it and ended it the way that she had envisioned it, and readers are just along for the ride - it is a bumpy, emotional one, but it is a journey I'm glad I experienced.		Complimentary copy provided by author/publisher for an honest review.		4 poison apple stars!
0,4.5 out of 5 stars	I was provided a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.		Club Volare has, or is trying to have, a new club in the amazing city of New Orleans.  I don't know about you, but I would love to see New Orleans.  The French Quarter.  How romantic.  *sigh* Now it appears there will be a new sight to visit.  How exciting.		Just a foot note here  though not necessary for the enjoyment of this book, I would suggest you grab the prequel, First Night.  It will introduce Olivia and Gavin and tell how they spent that week.		Okay, how many of us wanted to bop Gavin upside the head?  Maybe even a full on Gibbs slab?  I mean really?  Does he not know how to practice what he preaches?  *grin*  Gotta love those characters that get the dander up.  He may have been hot, but in his own words Im a great Dom . . . But I am a bad boyfriend.  I will go on record as saying, I am not even sure about the great Dom bit.  I repeat, practice what he preaches.  But he did come around in the end and see the light.  So all is well.		Watching Olivia grow and blossom was beautiful.  Inspiring even.  I was so happy for her when she finally figured out who and what she wanted to be.		I was impressed how the title of this book was tied into this story. (Oops.  Sorry for the pun. *grin*) That doesnt always happen so seamlessly.  It was actually quite beautiful.  Well done.		Wonderful story with interesting characters.  And what characters they are.  I look forward to all of their books, as well as the downfall of the evil nemesis.  Yep, that thread was left dangling.  Dont worry.  No cliffhanger.  A rather satisfying ending in fact.  Just that dangling thread and several fun characters to look forward to.  Nice job.
0,Lincoln and Daisy are both hiding from their past. Lincoln has everyone that he works with believing he is a ladies man when in fact his heart and soul belong to someone who doesn't even know who he is anymore. Daisy is trying to get over the abuse her ex husband caused. When Lincoln and Daisy first meet they are instantly drawn to each other. Almost like they knew the pain each other was hiding. Their friendship grew a little faster than they expected along with some feelings that caught them off guard.		Daisy was the first person he trusted with his secrets. As their relationship grows they start to push each other away, both afraid of being hurt again. What they soon realize is that they are meant to be together to fully heal their hearts.		I have read all of the Oxford series and with each book Lauren seems to pull me in just a little bit more. I can't wait to see what she has in store for us next.
0,Of all five stories, this is the mildest.  Asher is a more gentle Dom than we have found before.  Charlotte has become a tyrant.  She ignores the wishes of her parents and the expectations of the ton. She does what she wants regardless of the consequences.  In order to get out from under her damaging behavior, Charlottes parents offer her hand in marriage to a man they know is a strong, dominant male.  Asher is attracted to Charlotte and agrees to marry her on his terms.  She becomes his wife in name only.  She is his little one.  Charlotte rebels a little, but finds this lifestyle really suits her.  Together, they become a happily married Papa and little.
0,Quick and delightful. Well edited and surprisingly well developed for such a short story. The story is written with the feel of listening to someone tell a story rather than feeling as if you are in the midst of it. Yes it's a formula feel good romance. That's exactly what I wanted this time and the emotional payoff was right on target.
0,Loved it
0,I loved this story!! I was rooting the entire way for Ms. "Women's Lib" to be upended and her posterior turned the color of a fire engine ;-), but that's half the fun isn't it? :)		I said this in my review for Betrothed as well, but it bears repeating. I really liked how Ms. Leigh made clear that the women deserved equality and fair treatment while at the same time acknowledging that you can be completely "equal" and still a spanked wife/fiance. ;-) I tell people that all the time "Yes! I am a feminist - I believe women have the right to choose and consent - I just happen to wanna consent to Alpha males busting my rear" ;-)		The "bad guys" were vile and hateful and I HATED them, but again something you want in a book. to hate the enemy. :)		I really enjoyed it! :)		NOTE: I noticed in another review someone commented on the "alternative history" I didn't think this book was supposed to be a "true to the times" book, I read it wanting spanks and spicy women, not an accurate historical lesson. ;-) I liked the creativity shown.
0,Heartblaze 1 Vampire Soul is a well-written book dealing with mortals, vampires, werewolves, reincarnation, and a group that hunts/kills paranormals. In some respects it is a paranormal romance, in others not so much. The story is about Emma Rue told from multiple viewpoints, as characters rotate out thru the chapters. Historical characters make brief cameo appearances which add realism. This book was not a standalone, but rather the beginning of a serial. Heartblaze 1 Vampire Soul does not end on a cliffhanger, more at a pause in the story. I received a free copy of this book and voluntarily chose to review it.
0,I had no idea what do weres think,feel or live . It goes without too much of a stretch when people explore other lives in other realities surprises pop up.
0,This was an interesting mermaid story, though I'd hoped for a different ending. A decent little read, but I don't know that I'm hooked enough to pay for the rest of the series (after getting this book free).
0,Once again Dawn Robertson has written an amazing book!! This series is what brought me to love Dawn and I hate to see it endAlthough I am excited for her next series the Hells Renegades!!!		This book had me going through a roller coaster of emotions!! Seven James has been a bada$$ from the beginning. I have seen her go through many up and downs and have some very vulnerable moments throughout the Hers series, all of which made her more likable. She is by far one of my favorite characters! In HIS you see her work through her weakness and come back to the bada$$ take no s*** woman we have all loved from the beginning. Seven F-ing James is back!! She learns to open up and let new people in. The relationship with her and Lyric is sweet, super excited to have more of her story.  I love the MC characters being brought more into the book and the dynamic with them all together is great. I was excited that Ryker is back into the story and cannot wait for his story to be out!! Great end to the series and transition to the next!!		If you have not read the Hers Series what are you waiting for?!?!?!
0,Wow this second book to the Dragon Jewels is a great book loved it and can't wait to see what Ruby glass comes up with next.  The one thing I hate is the people who are either against them enough that they want to hurt them or destory the shifters of any kind.
0,Lauren and Chase, Alexis and Grant, and Haley and Wes were all wholesome characters. They were responsible, loyal, funny, a nd sexy. These are the kind of people I want as friends and neighbors. I look forward to reading Series Book 4-6.
0,Xavier is the second book Ive read from MJ Fields and certainly not the last. The first book I read and the first in the series, Jase was great and I was looking forward to reading more. The Men of Steel series is hot, intriguing and captivating. You can read each book out of order if need be, it won't affect the overall premise. I enjoyed the fun banter between all the characters and the lingo. I loved this book a little more than Jase, Xavier just seemed more fun and more of a bad boy. I cant wait to read Cyrus though, the eldest brother with the most attitude.		Xavier Steel is a twenty three year old playboy that seems to get into trouble and brings embarrassment to his family. The youngest of the Steel boys, Xavier has had to watch the others find their place in life. Xavier isn't so lucky, he doesnt know what he wants and only thinks about the next girl he will seduce.		To escape the media, the whole family is in Italy. Xavier is tired of watching his brothers and partners with their happiness and is determined to find his own path. Although he wants to make it on his own terms. Going back home, Xavier has decided to start his own production company. His mother helps by hiring an assistant for him.		Taelyn Patrick is the only female sibling. With three brothers and a Boston Detective for a father, life hasn't been very girly and relationships were not common. Taelyn met Daniel three years ago and has been with him ever since. Daniel is going to college and Taelyn is looking for a job to help pay for his tuition; Momma Joe called and offered her the position of Xaviers assistant and with the amount of money she was offering, Taelyn couldn't turn it down.		Xavier wasn't too excited about learning of his new assistant, her personnel file was of a dorky, pure girl that wouldnt be able to handle a playboy like Xavier. But when he met her in person, that all changed. Taelyn is a beautiful young woman with a lot of intelligence and know how.		Together this unlikely duo set about creating the office and finding local talent. The more they worked together, the more Taelyn saw the real Xavier and his handsome features.		Can Taelyn quell Xaviers sexual prowess? Will Xavier create a company that his family will be proud of? Will his bad boy ways be squashed by this innocent, strong willed Irish lass?		I love the protectiveness of Xavier, he proves that he genuinely cares for Taelyn; but will she treat him just like a brother or something much more? Taelyn is splendid, she doesnt hold back and tells it like it is. I loved this book and all the characters, such a loveable family and so loyal to each other. This is a new adult series that must be read.
0,they are nice easy cheerful books with very little, if any, violence
0,Cass doesn't remember her early childhood.  She doesn't trust many people and keeps to herself.  Suddenly thrust into a whole she didn't even know existed she has to start trusting a few more people, but can she?  Should she is an even better question...I really enjoyed this and can't wait for the next one!!  Love Cass and Ari!
0,It nice story well written. Love the plot and the character development was good as well. True page Turner love it
0,This book is no fluff. It was right on point. Armaan gives you a exact how to book on Amazon Affiliate. My take away was keywords. You have to do your own research on recent plugins.
0,'Eternal' is the second book in the Dragon Wars series by Rebecca Royce and according to the time to read thingy on my Kindle, it took me about four and a half hours to read it. It grabbed me on the first page and didn't let go until I got to the end.		Like the first book, 'Forever', it is set in a future hundreds of years from now, when humans would be considered mythological if not for the technology they left behind. Beginning a year after the events in book 1,  'Eternal' is a compelling paranormal romance set in the heart of the Dragon Wars and begins on the front lines with werewolf commander Dougal Owens and his mate, scientist Caitlyn Knox going on a mission to the island the Dragon Queen uses as her nest. Things go wrong from the beginning and although they mate quite early in the book, they are separated very quickly, Dougal staying on the front line whilst Caitlyn returns to her lab with what they found in order to develop a weapon they can use against the Dragons. The HEA they eventually get is mostly surrounded by torture, loss, pain and sorrow. But there is a little bit of joy in the mix.		There are a lot of surprises in this story, some good but some very bad and you need to put your squeamish head away before you read it. There are scenes which made me cry for the characters, and there's very little in the way of humour, but it deals with the realities of war and I couldn't put it down. Characters from the first book, 'Forever', play a part in the story when Caitlyn goes home to Springdale, but you won't feel like you've missed anything if you haven't read it.  I really liked Breezy and could have wished he got something better than he did, but Brett got exactly what he deserved. This is not a touchy feely romance, but there is a lot of action and a couple of steamy bits. Although it is part of a series, there are no cliff-hangers, but there is an opening for the next book. This book can be read as a stand alone and I would highly recommend giving this series a read. If you like it and want to read more, 'Always', book 3 in the series is part of the 'Romancing the Wolf' Anthology that is also being  released today (30th June) and I'm really looking forward to reading it.
0,The strange abilities he has and the fact that he is an orphan during most of the book as well as breaking laws all to save others but always staying true to his nature make this a great book and I enjoyed reading it allot
0,Eating vegan, even if only once time a week, is an excellent way to become and remain healthy, increase energy, and achieve and maintain a person's proper weight. Doing so more than once a week increases the benefit. By following veganism, we cease exploiting animals and making our bodies a cemetery for them. I found that Karen Greevang's collection of books, including this one, offer great help in preparing tasty and enjoyable vegan meals.
0,The book was very good. It had a little of everything in it. The thing is that have a good night together is the end but not for the pair to be parents. They grow to pair has a family. I will read this book again.
0,Poor Rosie had given up on her dream of moving to the British countryside when her live-in boyfriend Mark, an underappreciated journalist, gets the assignment of writing a regular column on how -- in Mark's editor's words -- "moving from the city to the country is the millennium dream" and "what it's really like to swap SW7 for rural heaven."		Needless to say, the relocation to the village of Eight Mile Bottom ne'er runs smooth. Mark is no less self-absorbed in the village than he was in their apartment in the London suburb of Easthampstead. (After all, he moved for his own benefit, not because of what Rosie wanted.) But Rosie rises to the occasion and comes into her own. Farm Fatale combines both quite funny situations and some sweet bits in a convincing fashion without it sounding patched together.		At the same time, B-grade actress and trophy wife Samantha Villiers relocates to the same village, along with her ruthless, cynical and self-absorbed banker husband Guy Grabster. Samantha, a selfish prima donna given to embellishing her movie rsum, has succumbed to every passing fad, and that includes the new trend of country life. Samantha now envisions herself the lady of the manor at The Bottoms, a 17th century manor house, and the arbiter of life in Eight Mile Bottom. You'll forsee that this grasping social climber will get her comeuppance, but, when it comes, you'll still savor the satisfaction.		Farm Fatale, of course, constitutes a Cinderella story with Rosie in the starring role. I won't ruin the novel for you by giving away who fills the role of Prince Charming, but I promise you'll love to see Rosie happy at long last.		This is my first Wendy Holden novel; it won't be the last.
0,Its a very short read packed full of emotions.  A Dad struggling after his wifes death and his autistic son not coping well with the current situation.  Then Mom saves the day even though she's passed on and everything changes for the better. A very good story!
0,*** This ARC was received from Random House Publishing Group - Loveswept via Netgalley in exchange for a honest review***		Let me just say, I LOVE ME A SCOT!! The dialect, the forwardness, the fierce loyalty and from the descriptions the bodies too!	Duncan sounds amazing. He tries to be strong and politically correct all while be very hurt in battle. He feels an instant connection with Grace and still tries to do what is right, even when he feels its wrongness strongly.	Grace is smart, strong, beautiful and very brave to venture out to help after the battle. She happens upon(falls on) Duncan and is instantly wants to stay by his side. She knows the way they are speaking so openly to each other is highly inappropriate but feels in her bones that she has been missing that exact thing in her life.	I love that fate keeps them together enough to establish a strong bond and that they worked hard to keep that bond.	The Highland Knights is an amazing idea and I wonder if that was something that actually went on back then and was just so secret it was never documented. The men chosen for this group are perfect and I am looking forward to hearing about them all in the continuation of this series.
0,I got a lot from reading this book. It was what I needed. Thank you! Knowing God's will is the best feeling ever.
0,Juliette is a 23 year old young lady working 3 jobs to try and make ends meet. Her mother passed away from cancer and dad turned to drinking and gambling and eventually got shot and died.

He will pay her debt off for one year of sex with her and no type of relationship just sex. This situation becomes a tangled web and things happen to them. Please take the chance with this book because it is a good story.
0,UN - Useless Nitwits		Globalisation is not the way when you allow the UN to dictate your country: A tower of Babel !
0,My son has been reading these books and absolutely loves them! He told me this one is the best of the series, and he would give it six stars if he could.		There was constant action, he loves all the characters (Olum being his favorite), and he desperately hopes there is more to come. This is definitely a series parents should consider for their tweens and teenagers. Dragons and action- who could ask for more?
0,This is not a mnage story between Smith, Lydia and Dex, but is definitely beautifully and tastefully well written, and it takes place at their BDSM club. A real emotional and sexy story about Smith's love and dedication to Lydia helping her regain her self-esteem.		Julia Sykes's writing style does nothing but make me greedy for more and more of her amazing stories.		I was lucky to put my hands on this particular story when I purchase the Anthology For the First Time: Twenty-One Brand New Stories of First Love, a couple months ago and I highly recommend it.
0,A sweet uplifting story that reminds us to count our blessings. A family struggling during the Depression is grateful for simple things, such as being able to give each boy a peppermint stick for Christmas. In our materialistic society, this enjoyable little story makes us stop and appreciate the many blessings we have.
0,Wonderful.  Although,  he irritates us at times we finally get to where we need to be.		Sloane and Cruz are the perfect summer read and they capture your heart. Sweet summer romance that will anchor itself for a lifetime.
0,Having read every one of Elle's books I am  huge fan. Bringing out  prequel as this was awesome. Gio and Isabel's story was perfect to say the least. The hint for future books made be thrilled with joy. Bring it on Elle. Shifter Forever Fan All the way!
0,Getting Out Of Hand is the first book in what appears to be a wonderful new small town steamy romance series.  Erin Nicolas story-line is filled with real-life issues yet is a bit on the humorous side.  Her characters are life-like with real problems that are dealt with compassion and humor.  I won't go over the synopsis as it has already been done in many of the other reviews of this heartwarming book yet I will just say the Ms. Nicholas has outdone herself with new starter novel and I am sure that you will enjoy reading Getting Out Of Hand. I know that I did.		I received this advanced copy and I am freely posting this fair and balanced review.
0,The author asked if I would write a review of this short story in exchange for my opinion, so here it is..... the book overall I enjoyed. It was humerous and strangely satisfying. I would recommend this short story to readers like me who love weird, funny stories with a little action. But I do have to warn you, it does get steamy. Personally, I would have loved to see the characters evolve more, which would mean for the author to rewrite it as an actual novel (*hint: please, Ms. Bishop, try ), but then again, maybe there's a reason for short stories.
0,Harper's day just keeps getting worse. After a happy family gathering turns bad she's had enough. Then her car known as "Baby" has an issue. On the side of the road Harper gets introduced to a hot knight in shining armour or so she thinks. Great series starter! This book has it all. Hot male werewolf, and vampire mafia. OH, did I mention really hot sex? Cliff hanger alert! I got the next book immediately. Great read.
0,This is the first in the Willow Son series and I absolutely loved it!!! This is one of my favorite authors and you will not be disappointed!!! Can't wait til the next one
0,This is a fantastic story with a HEA.  Audrey has suffered so much.  Her family killed and she sold into slavery was all thrust upon her.  When Audrey escapes and gets rescued by Styx, it is all she can do is survive but survive she does.  Styx and Audrey have quite an adventure.  The plot and characters are very well written and developed.  A very good   read.
0,I love this story. I love how each of the books in the series are very different. The only problem I have is the grammatical errors. I'm looking forward to the next book.
0,Simple story with some added twists. I like it. You feel like you want to find your own True North! This is all about LOVE!
0,I loved this series!! Cali & Chrissy went through so much drama!! If you haven't read this series yet, you need to one click now!! Ms. Neicy is a talented writer & def brings the heat!!
0,Very nice book, I love reading about Sheikh
0,Both books from the series, all beautifully packaged and read for your enjoyment and when I say enjoyment I have no doubt that that is exactly what you will get when you turn over the first page, because I enjoyed it from start to finish.	I am going to review this book as one entire story  I hadnt read the books separately before so it makes sense for me to just look at the whole picture	When Isla lost her parents her perfectly ordered and nurturing home life were ripped from her and she living with members of her family that I wouldnt trust to sit the right way round on the toilet, let alone bring up a child. And I was devastated as the true extent of their disgraceful behaviour unfolded because I hate it in cases like this when Im right.	The way they treated Isla was completely reprehensible they effectively strip her bare of all her humanity and hold her prisoner, but as if that wasn't bad enough they physically abuse her  if I could have reached into the story and plucked her from the pages I would have, I read much of the details with a constant stream of tears trickling down my face.	But then you have Joshua, now I liked him, I wanted him to be strong and he was, he listened to his heart and was willing to do what it was going to take to find out the truth and a way to get Isla back. Joshua has a history with Isla but he has long since accepted that she was dead, that the little girl he loved when he was a boy has gone.	But when he bumped into Rosa he couldn't shake the feeling that she wasn't who she said she was, that there was more to her story than she was telling him. He just would not let the doubt go, he could rest until he found out  he had to know if the woman he could see before him, was the Isla he lost so long ago?	Just how far would he go? Well how long is a piece of string  he was willing to do whatever it took uncover the truth, but would her past be willing to let her go or were they destined to part ways again?	Could he show her the sort of love that she deserved, that she should have had all her life?	Would they or could they survive the upheaval that was to come?	Yes there were a slew of questions and theories throughout the book, there were characters that were a disgrace to humanity, people who although they personified evil were given the good grace to exhibit their personalities in the understanding that as the reader, we needed to experience the bad in order to be able to appreciate the beautiful.	And Isla and Joshua were just that, they were impossible not to love.	I loved the prose and lilt of the story, the intensity that was injected and the emotion that flowed. This is a novel that will keep you engaged from beginning to end, it isn't the easiest of read in parts as some of the subject matter is difficult but through the tears, I have to say that I thought the story was superb.
0,I am 100% certain that I haven't LOVED a dark villainous captor this much since Caleb in The Dark Duet. This was written so well... all the things, the traps, that I hate when some try to write this kind of story and fall into were avoided here. Celeste was a strong-willed woman. Though she had nothing and came from nothing she was a constant reminder that as long as we have free will nothing else matters. She fought Leonide tooth and nail from the very beginning. Even though she was most definitely attracted to the man, and felt a ton of confusion regarding some of those feelings not once did she stop fighting for what she wanted. Freedom to choose!!!		Leonide, WOO! I don't even know where to start. First, I'd like to say this book was definitely dark, but it wasn't dark in a gross or overtly brutal kind of way. It was more of a mindscrew and it definitely felt good. Leonide said and did cruel things but he also was a conflicted man... It was amazing how he was able to get a reaction from Celeste or screw her mind all up without even having to cause her physical harm at times. At other times, he was like a freaking demon, and it wasn't clear what exactly he would do with her. He was really complex and I am always amazed when I find myself feeling one way about a character and then feeling completely different in the end. Even though Leonide does make some changes, he also makes it very clear up to the ending of the book he is who he is. I loved that the best, because it would be unrealistic for him to change completely.		I just loved it. I was a fan of Nora Flite after I gorged myself on The Body Rock Series but this just cemented the "I will read anything you write" status for me... only a handful of authors are in that category for me.		Quote Love:		"Her words struck something in me, a statement I'd been slapped by... how long ago? I don't want to be boring. I can fix myself."		"I'm not those women. I'm Celeste Barstow... and you're a _____ demon."		"He growled in my ear, clawed at me not like someone in love-- but someone who hated my guts. I didn't care at all. Even hate was better than indifference; more satisfying than the man who had slid on a mask and could walk away from me after..."
0,This is the kind of story that you can't put down.  Since it is a sereal, I have to wait for the next episode which is where I am now.  The hero is trying to be a Dr with a prosthetic hand and his tutor is an emergency room Dr with a son that has autism and wants a Daddy really bad.  Everyone wants each other but they all have so much healing to do that they are not overcoming their problems.  I hope that the next episode will shed some light on this and they will see that they are meant to be a family.  Can't wait.
0,Lots of interesting information on jai alai.  As always, A.J. Stewart gives you an excellent read.
0,Christmas is my favorite time of the year and I absolutely love Christmas love stories. There's something so magical about falling in love at Christmastime.		A Romance for Christmas is the story of Dara, a single mother, who has lost everything she loved most in a tragic accident. All she has left is her daughter and she is struggling to make ends meet.		A knock on the door late at night brings Dara something she never expected. Officer Scott is kind, thoughtful and everything Dara needs in her life. Can he really be her Christmas wish?		I loved this story and it left me glowing with love. Both Dara and Scott have experienced loss and my heart goes out to them both. I just want to hug Dara tight.		The only thing I didn't like was that it ended too soon! I wanted to read more. :-(		If you believe in love, especially when it comes at Christmas, you have to read this sweet short story romance!		I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review
0,*** provided by the author for an honest review ***		So for the first few pages of the book I was wondering if I'd be able to get into it. The main character starts off as a spoiled brat, who has no desire to follow in the family footsteps. As such, she's been riding through life on her mother's charity, and has absolutely no skills to take care of herself. I did not empathize at all. I'm glad I stuck with it though, it turned out to be really good.		But then the crap hits the fan and her life gets turned upside down. She adapts fairly quickly with some help from a stranger. Watching her grow up is both hilarious and poignant. The situations she got into had me laughing out loud at times. I especially liked her diary entries. She kept putting her goals down to keep herself on track and then fails miserably in a hilarious fashion.		By the end of the book she becomes a totally different person and I was rooting for her 100%.
0,The book goes back and forth between two couples who the men fell in love quickly..  They were both rakes one was 35 and tired of his life style.  The younger was sent a prostitute who turned out to be a virgin so he thought he had to marry her. The people did not know each other long but they actually did love one another. She author has some characters from her earlier books which is nice to catch up on their life.  I have never disliked anything the author has written.
0,Prior to contracting Scorpius, Tace Justice was a by-the-book good ol' boy from Texas, former medic in the military and all around good guy. After contracting Scorpius syndrome, Tace is hanging on to his humanity by his fingernails just hoping not to turn into a ripper which is what they call a person that went insane and became dangerous to themselves and others after contracting Scorpius. There is no known cure for someone who has turned into a ripper except a bullet.	Sami Steel has been a member of Vanguard for a long time, but little is really known about her except that she was a former LAPD rookie before Scorpius but her story never adds up. Sami is a master of hand to hand combat but can't shoot strait to save her life and it's raised a few questions about whether or not she is who she says and as it turns out she's not former LAPD after all but a hacker with a secret. Sami knows the location of The Bunker, the secret research facility that everyone has been looking for hoping they found the cure for Scorpius!
0,I've bought several books by this author and she never ceases to keep my interest.  When I saw this offer, I just had to pick it up.		There's a section for each day with an interesting tale of what happened that day in history. The first thing everyone in my family did was check out their birthdays. This is a good book to keep on your Kindle for those times you are waiting in line or are on hold waiting for customer service.		Just be aware that you may find yourself going to just one more day and then just one more day after that. What a great concept for a book and a fun way to delve into history.
1,In this book the author introduced a ex of the bear king...his new love is stuck .. what should she do.? The story line is kind of plain.. not a lot of substance. It's a good short read with not a deep plot so you can whip through it and not really miss anything. Good light reading.
1,The book starts with an interesting premise. But I found the writing to be rather adolescent. The plot was simplistic and  the end seemed like it was close to where the story should have begun. I also have a pet peeve about idiots who use the word calvary, when they mean cavalry. Clearly there is good reason this author self-published. If I were a publishing house editor, I wouldn't touch this until it were properly polished into a good novel.
1,This was a HUGE ripoff.  "Three books.!"  What a joke.  More like 3 (long) chapters in which not much happens but whet your appetite a bit. Then it ends.  You can buy the next chapters in the series for 4.99 and then the next for 6.99 and then the next for 9.99.  I don't think so.  Spent an entire afternoon reading and then...nothing.  Buy more.  Will NOT buy anything from this author again.	Many authors lead from one book to the next hoping to entice the reader.  Many times I am intrigued and buy the next in the series after reading a free (but complete in itself) volume.  That is great....if an author wants to catch me, write a good story.  No story here.
1,While I enjoyed reading the next episode in the series, the relationship between the two main characters had no resolution, the ending was a tease to reel you in for the next episode/book.  This was not a resolution and I feel very much misled and let down by the ending.  I realize the end point is continuing to hook you in but it seem there were other ways the story arc could have gone to get you to pick up the next book/?  I would have rated the book much higher otherwise.  Good name for #5 "The Betrayal"
1,So I read about 45% of the book hoping I would start to like it. The beginning caught my attention, but just couldn't hold  it, but I did skip to the end to see what happens.
1,I finished Chapter one of Belgravia.  It's short and I must say there is not much THERE there! It all takes place in 1815 in BRUSSELS before Napoleon meets his end at Waterloo.  It mostly takes place just before and during a Ball  I'd say the 1st chapter is priced just about right!
1,I understand that this is a novella, a prequel, but it didn't do it for me.  It didn't captivate me.  I liked the idea of San Francisco being the backdrop since that's my city.  Um, but that's about it.  I've read other books by Ms. Blakely and liked them.  I guess this series is just not going to make it into my kindle library.  Sorry.
1,Story was nice. Writing was not. Author was all over the place. Sometimes I wasn't sure which character was speaking.
1,This was the weakest link In the story.		Because of real life, it took me a few days to read this, maybe that'swhy I wasn't that into it. Quite frankly I was wanting it to be over		The demand her father made so that she would receive his blessing on a marriage was ridiculous. ...more
1,If you'd like to read a pretentious Los Angelean's autobiography about her personal difficulties finding zen and soot-free environs in the middle of Smog Town, then you might like this book.		If, on the other hand, you're a serious herbalist looking for a decent handbook to give to a client or student, or a person who's yearning to dip a toe into the deep pool of essential oil lore, then don't waste your time or money on this mess. Ms. Muller's folksy stories about her grandparents odd ways were the only things of interest in this mewling diatribe against big city life.		Seriously, Lady, pick a pasture already.
1,I was given this book from lovers of paranormal (LOP) and the author is exchange for an honest review.		I'm sorry. I really am. This book only received 1.5 stars out of 5 due to the fact that it is extremely rushed, there is like no depth to the story at all, and you don't really know the characters. I mean really? Run on sentences, horrible grammar and punctuation and there were spelling mistakes in there too. I seriously feel bad about reviewing this book. I hated the fact that the book would start to get interesting, and yes Amber read another sentence its going to get great soon, and then nope. BOMB! I'm going to read book 2 just because I did sign up for the ARC, and I seriously hope that the second book far surpasses the first book. I will go into it with an open mind and hope for the best.		Thanks for letting me read and review this, but seriously you probably shouldn't have.
1,Boring
1,doesn't do anything, cards come up with nothing that barely gives you a answer	 many of these games I have are worth anything... none are fun,	why isn't anyone working on this?
1,I realize that this is only the first book but it lacked the excitement that i'm use to reading. I can only hope that the series gets better.
1,The story has a good premise but some character transitions are clumsy. The character development is choppy without enough depth. This story also needs to be edited for grammar and omissions. The build up to the ending was predictable. I will not be purchasing the follow-up books.
1,2 1/2 stars		Super short but steamy.  Not bad for a novella.  Dane and Charlotte used to be an item, but due to family issues and personal issues, Dane left to find himself and to better himself for Charlotte, only to come home and find her gone.  When Dane finally returns home, he wants nothing more than to have his woman back.  Charlotte puts up a half-assed fight and they end up back in bed.  Dane discovers Charlotte gave birth to his son and wants to be a family.  This could have been better if it was longer.  Dane never even set eyes on the son he's never knew about.  Besides the sex, this book was lacking.
1,After reading the first few chapters I was bored. I hoped it would get better but it didn't. Just when I thought the book finally was getting a little bit better it ended, just like that.
1,waste of time it doesn't finish any of the stories unless you want to get the other books yuck
1,this game should be a classic, but sadly the digital version falls short of my expectations. I would not recommend
1,Alright read, Ricks situation was better to read about than what was going on with Zane and Moet. I don't see why she was sooo sick like that without something coming out of it. Their relationship was moving way too fast for her to still be hung up on Ki. The ending was alright but the situation was a bit much; if that was the case Jonathan shouldve been more active in the story so his crazy didn't come off as just a way to leave you hanging until the next one.
1,This had potential to be a good book, but the grammar & poor editing made some of sections cringe worthy to read. Also, so many things were left unexplained like the brilliant plan they had that almost had all of them killed or how you can be married or date for years & not know your spouse's parents. And I guess everyone was mentally unstable because the hate throughout the book made no sense. I also wish we got to see the relationship develop between the main characters instead of skip to 3 months later & they're in a relationship. I was just disappointed because I felt like the title implied the story to be something it was not.
1,I read this story on a P&P fan site and just read this final copy.  It was okay, but I found it somewhat boring.  I tend to like modern-day P&P variations, but this is not one I would recommend unless you get it free like I did.
1,Did not finish.
1,It's pulling me right now at this point I'll just go through each book and give the short , statement at this point Rain will do anything to keep her family together as a true sister
1,This was a short quick read. Heath Evans is rich and handsome he is also a psycho who is going around raping and torturing young women. Tahlia Parker knows who is doing it and is too afraid to tell because Heath is her step brother and she can't resist him. This book was too short for me this is my first time reading this authors work while the book was very well written with no errors in grammar or spelling and I know that this was the first book in this series I felt that a lot of things were left out and there were a lot of questions that I had. I felt confused and wished it was better.
1,I though it was going to be about druids not about a revolt in england I  don't kneed a book about that I can just watch the news.
1,It's just porn with history thrown in... and we already know that. The sci-fi is poor. This is supposed to be 1000 years in the future. More like 40 or 50 years. Science or its extrapolation is really not a forte of this author. I guess sex is. But I found it tiresome and generally inappropriate. It was an excuse for a decent plot.
1,Really awful. Sorry, but this author writes like she's talking to children and explaining what happened at school today.  Sort of like, "Simon works too hard and doesn't listen to his sister. Julia decides to sleep with Simon because she has pent up need and is not very bright."  Some of this is due to the fact that the author writes in third person omniscient. ("Third person omniscient is a method of storytelling in which the narrator knows the thoughts and feelings of all of the characters in the story.")  This is not a good idea for erotic romance because readers really can't place themselves in the story.	The story begins with the one-night stand in a long drawn out explanation that is designed to convince the reader that Julia is not an idiot. But, that doesn't really work. Julia's reasons for her one night stand with Simon are just plain dumb. Moreover, there is no heat. No build-up. She doesn't even seem that attracted to him. There's nothing to make readers interested in these two. What follows in the hotel room is just a giant yawn.	So that's the set up and the rest of the story is how these two end up in the same summer cottage for a week and play cat and mouse and obviously they have to fall in love and all that.  Anyway, getting back in bed together takes forever while we are bored with way too many details about their professional lives and the drama of all their extended family and friends. You can skim most of this book because not much happens, especially in the bedroom. On my hot-o-meter scale of one to five (five being the hottest) I'd give this a one.  And those little blurbs of "tips" to "modern girls" at the beginning of every chapter?  Not funny or insightful. This author is really kidding herself.
1,Feel like she left you wondering what was going to happen.  Wished that she would have wrote 1 more chapter
1,My favorite character in this whole book was the baby.		My distant second favorite was Alex.		Everyone else could take a seat.		The wife, Keilana, was a controlling shrew. It was obvious her husband, Alex, had really deep issues with his family. Like really deep. And she decides to show up on their doorstep to force his hand in reconciling with his family. No, you don't ambush your husband in that way.		Alex had his issues, sure. But I think the author did a good job of making his issues feel plausible for him. And yet the entire book has people lining up to repeatedly tell him how completely invalid his feelings are. I scratch my head at how great a case the author makes for Alex's state of mind and feelings and yet alows the other characters to pile on as if he is in the wrong.  You don't go behind his back. It felt manipulative and wrong. And I won't even talk about her 'job changing plans' that spontaneously occurs at the end of the book. Again, no discussion with her husband... just upend their lives because that was she wants.		Alex's family as a whole were presented as nice, loving decent people. I suppose they were. But they also came off as a bit self righteous with a heaping help of 'let me tell you how you should feel.'		Book ends kinda abruptly, obviously more to come.  But not really interested in following up.
1,Something was missing with this book!!!  Not as good as the first books.  Please rewrite this story.		Not  a good story!!
1,This was a fairly decent friends to lovers story. It was well written, the characters have amazing chemistry, the sex scenes are scorching hot but it was just too angsty for me. Ava didn't have the nerve to go for what she really wanted and Sam couldn't buy a clue. I just got sooooo frustrated waiting for these two to get themselves straight and see what was right in front of them the whole time. If you like your romances with lots of angst you should give this one a try, that was the only part of the story I didn't enjoy but I know there are others who love that. If you don't love a lot of angst then I would give this one a pass. I received an ARC of this book from the publisher through Net Galley in exchange for an honest review.
1,The book was yo long.
1,It was childish and i quit after the firstfew pages.  The name was very misleadfing and should have been named "Boy meets girl and girl giggles"
1,This is finally over, thank God. Kenneth is horrible, his behavior is deplorable for most of the book. Then, there's Lisa, she's the biggest doormat there is. She finally grows a pair for about 2 weeks, or 1 Chapter and then puff, back with Kenneth she goes and suddenly all is great even when he plain tells her it's just sexual. They got the HEA, finally. I was enjoying that part, the first epilogue was just beautiful and then...there was a second epilogue, and that ruined everything for me, HATED IT. One epilogue too long, over done and over the top. My biggest recommendation would be not to start this at all, especially if you are like me that needs to finish what they start. I want my time and money back.
1,Somewhere between crude and unappealing , yet bits of this story does work. Maybe I just don't "feel" this author's style?  MC number one is a  crude fire chief, MC number 2 is a cry baby superchef?  There certainly seems to be a good chance of HEA because I really don't think anyone else is going to be wanting them.
1,This book was given to me for free as part of the #randomhousemystery chat pack from HouseParty.com.		This is supposed to be a mystery, set in the good ol' Pacific Northwest.	It's not very mysterious. The killer is given away at the beginning of the book. And even all the off shoots fail terribly at derailing you from your suspicions.		There were a few issues I had aside from the transparency though. One was the emotionless state of Marley, especially considering everything she is forced through. It wasn't lost on me that she was judging another woman for her emotionlessness, or theatrics, when she herself was guilty of what she was judging.		The unrealistic nature of how everything went down was also disappointing. Nothing flowed or felt natural--or even remotely plausible.		Marley is stupid. She does every stupid thing that should never be done in the situations she finds herself in--which only added to the forcefulness behind the plot, ruining any flow that could have been had here.		But what really ruins it, is the great unloading by the killer at the end, putting everything in place. I despise this. It's lazy, and I lose any respect I possibly have for the read when this takes place.		Aside from all that, this book was tedious. There is no excitement. It's boring, transparent and a difficult read. I wouldn't have bothered finishing it had I not been committed because of how I received the book.		Anywho, this book isn't for me. I'm sure there are some who would enjoy it, I mean there is a reader for pretty much every book.
1,It was a well written short story, but I do not know how I got it on the Kindle.  I need more knowledge.
1,This book was so bad!! I was surprised how bad it was!!
1,This was ok. Not much of a storyline.. Kinda boring, not much character development, just hot sex, other than that not much to the story
1,I hate it when authors start out for the first 2 or 3 chapters and get you thinking, "Hey, I think I'm going to like this book." ...and then the F-bombs start dropping and you realize you've just wasted your money, again, on a writer that can't figure out how to say something without resorting to the base and moronic. The only people I hear swear anymore are the ones that don't have the brains to figure out another word. Have no fear Scott...I'm happy to warn others.
1,I was very interested to read this book since procrastination is such a big problem, but honestly the book did not tell me anything I didn't know. It desperately needs an editor. So many sentences were so bad written, I had to read them three or four times trying to make some sense out of them. Would not recommend the book.
1,When I am reading a Sci-Fi about space travel I enjoy imagining technologies while unknown at present, maybe will be in use in the future. When a space plot is in the present, I expect the science represented in the story is current in aspect and facts. This author is telling a tale where the many of the facts are unlikely, unbelievable and often just plain wrong. The whole concept of a few high-government officials pulling-off any part of this caper is ludicrous. The ideas from losing a named asteroid's existence from the hundreds of interested astrologers eyes, to misappropriating a nuclear bomb from America's arsenal, to sending an astronaut off into space by himself without the basic necessities of life, as on the international space station, are not believeable. I Tried to stay with the story but it has reached a point by the second book that rather than being an enjoyable diversion, it is irritating me because the author did nothing in preparing this story to be believeable other than the concept a big asteroid can be a big problem.
1,The only reason I picked this book up was because of the title - Rocky Mountain.  I lived in Denver for three years and I figured this was a TMI romance book so I stopped before I got engrossed in it.  I'm sure it is a good book to others - romance with a lot of sex and very descriptive one at that is not my thing.
1,I didn't think the author needed 5 entire chapters to inform the reader just how miserable Caroline was at home with her mentally abusive father and how she got out of her father's home to go to her husband to be.  See I just synthesized 5 chapters into one rather long sentence.  The author spent 1/3 of this book getting us to the part where the young couple begin their relationship.		The book is about the couple not Caroline's miserable father.		The romance is sweet ...almost non-existent really.  The rest of the book seemed more of a bland synopsis of the Caroline's attempts to become a housewife rather than getting to know her future husband.
1,The original 50 shades trilogy was not written well, but it had its appeal.  It was a beauty and the beast tale that a lot of women go for, with a little salacious twist.  And in the end, the beast is tamed, and beauty lives happily ever after.	With this additional story, the beast is no more, he never was.  He is just a very abused, broken, confused and lonely little boy.  His only joys in life are his wealth and his penis.  This is just sad.  E.L. has completely emasculated poor Mr. Grey.  I'm surprised, after reading this, that Grey didn't have a total break down, and have to have Flynn put him back together again.	I have lived in Seattle my entire life, so all the errors the author makes in place names and directions is annoying, but forgivable.  But, I do find all the British terminology attributed to these Americans unforgivable.  Good authors write what they know.  EL, please take note.	All in all, there is nothing new here.  It's just a rehash from a different perspective.  And it's a very vanilla perspective.  If you like alpha males, avoid this book at all costs!  If you want a boy next door that just needs a little guidance, you might enjoy this new perspective.
1,Th abrupt ending was in the middle of the story.  You are reading along peacefully and all of a sudden there is instead of the  next chapter in the story it winds up with a lot of unanswered questions an an abrupt  the end almost like the author got tired of worrying and decided to end it's
1,Wow- this is some really bad writing. Some hours of my life I will never get back. Lame. Had to re-read several passages to be sure I caught what they meant, and even that was a waste of time.
1,The premise for this story is good but the plot is underdeveloped.  It is not even a good short story since everything is wrapped up in the last chapter with terrible explanations.  This was a waste of brain cells!
1,Venom of Vipers read like a mediocre episode of a television show or "made for TV" movie that could have aired on the Sci-Fi channel. The requisite elements were present and there were some potentially interesting ideas and a few decent characters to work with, but in the end the author failed to elevate the story to even "somewhat enjoyable". I don't know if this author's style just didn't sit well with me or perhaps I just wasn't in the mood for her story, but quite frankly I kept feeling like I was reading so-so fan-fiction, and not particularly creative fan-fiction at that.		The story basically revolves around 3 characters Nelson, Ryder and Katie...... none of which are fleshed out enough to really even understand at all beyond what you expect them to be given the narrative. Ryder comes the closest to being a character you can finally sort of climb into his head space, but the events and story are so implausible and/or nonsensical as to undercut any disposition you might have to suspend disbelief and connect with him.		Quite frankly, while there were a few somewhat interesting, redeeming passages in the book that kept if from being 1 star material, I really didn't find much in this book to enjoy and would recommend that if you enjoy quality Sci-Fi, avoid it. While it's very short and wouldn't take more than a few readings to get through, it's not worth your time.
1,I give the book two stars.  One star means "I hate it" according to Amazon.  Nuttall is too good a creator of premises for stories for me to say that.  I like his writing, generally, and own many of his space opera books.  The writing is probably worth 3 stars, not the 5 I've given other books.  Why 3?  Too many clich&eacute;d characters and situations.		What do you think is going to happen in a book called "The Trojan Horse?"  Compare this to one of his earlier books, The Arc Royal.  Knowing the name doesn't tell you what is going to happen.  Does he refer to the most recent British aircraft carrier, unfortunately decommissioned during budget cutbacks?  The one lost to a U-Boat?  The flagship of the English fleet that defeated the Spanish Armada?		What follows is my vent about some of the political ideas expressed in the book, for which I wanted to give it a single dim dwarf star.		Where I dropped out of enjoying the book was my discovery that 'me-first' survivalism was trumpted as a good idea.  Then Mr. Nuttall praised Reagan along with Lincoln and Washington.		Before reaching for American presidents to praise, let us remember what Reagan thought of hard science.  Here is a quote from the Library of Congress' Congressional Quarterly, which most people consider non-partisan:		"Congress on Nov. 20 [1984] overrode President Reagan's veto of a bill (HR 2409) reauthorizing selected research activities of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and creating a new institute for research on arthritis. The House acted first, on Nov. 12 voting 38032 to override. The bill became law  when the Senate also voted to override, 897."		Those are huge, bipartisan, majorities.  Not just liberals or Democrats, my friends.		Nuttall has an excellent point at the beginning of the novel.  He says (correctly I believe) that most first contact books feature evil aliens.  Thus, he says, it is not surprising that people panic when 17 space ships arrive.  Why not, Mr. Nuttall, write something different, one of those rare books where the Aliens aren't (intentionally, anyway) the bad guys?  Call the book, say, "The Statute of Liberty" after another famous gift.
1,I did not like it way short barely got into the story line seamed as soon as I got into the story it was done
1,Was getting ready to just abandon the book when I noticed that I was 80% done, so I finished it. I didn't enjoy any of the characters and didn't care what happened to any of them.
1,It started so well.  But then it devolved into a mess of poor writing and cliches.  The end was terrible.  That said, I give 4 stars for the first 50 percent.
1,It is a good thing this was a. Very short story as it wasn't even worth one star	I will avoid this. Author
1,There is nothing "ultimate" about this book. Apart from 2 recipes for crackers, it could be summed up by saying, "Add 2 to 8 tablespoons of flaxseed to any recipe". Ingredients and directions  are not given in standard  fashion, leaving the reader wondering exactly how to proceed. The level of English is very poor. I would not recommend this book to anyone, even if it were free. It is a waste of time to read it and I certainly will not waste time and money on trying the recipes when the directions do not even make sense.
1,I tried this and was unable to finish. When Anna came in to serve at a party with her skirt tucked into her knickers (the author says underwear--I live in England, nobody says underwear now, they definitely didn't say it then) I had to stop reading. I don't like American or modern jargon in Edwardian stories and I don't like modern plots and subplots in period pieces where they would never happen. I'm not an absolute stickler for authenticity, but it does have to be believable. No manor house would ever--EVER--have "Welcome to..." carved out in flowers and shrubbery unless the manor house was at Disneyland. This is England, and old money does not pander to theme park gardening. This story, while it may have potential, goes the wrong way too fast. It didn't take me very long to determine this wasn't a series I could get into. It just wasn't for me.
1,Too short. No substance. I paid too much for it - .99 cents - it should have been free. After reading the description and some of the reviews  I thought I would get more information to get to know more  about Bess and Simon when young, but I was disappointed.  So far, I have read every Charles Todd book and I plan to continue reading them as they come out.
1,Meh, You know those books where everyone is all "You need to read this!" and "Omg its just like the hunger games and all these other amazing things"...	This. Was. Not. Good.	Try watching The Bachelor a show I despise, then read this and tell me that I'm wrong. So I know I should've stuck with my gut on this one I mean everyone says its great and the last time I read one of those hyped up things I nearly gave up reading the Hyped books, but I have liked a few that got really hyped up The Hunger Games wasn't too bad till the movie came out and screwed everything up.	Though I'm sadden to say this was not one of them. I couldn't get passed the whole adding "factions" as the base and sole thing dystopian in this whole book. Then having them "compete" (really if flirting is competing like they did in Hunger Games then I mustve gotten the wrong copy... ) for the love/marriage of a prince. Who honestly was really really a nice guy. Another thing that irked me was some of the names in this book were just off the wall. The one and only good thing about what I did get out of all this was truly we women also want our first love but when they let you go we almost always treat the next best guy for us like road kill... But alas I have to know whether our main heroine will take off her Aspen colored glasses and see that the Prince is the cats meow...	Rating:1	Cover:4 That's another thing I'm a terrible sucker for a good cover!	recommending: nope.
1,I love romances involving dancers and a hero who is totally opposite of her.  I appreciate that this story involves a working dancer.  Usually romances featuring dancers are about ones permanently injured and thus their career is over or they're teaching at a studio.		Unfortunately as much as I liked this aspect of the story, it couldn't make up for the bizarre on again/off again uncertainty/confidence the h/H had around each other.  I've read other stories by this author (all of her Match books) and noticed that the leads, despite having slept together, act like they just shared a peck on the cheek and are strangely uncertain about the other, despite the fantastic night before.  It makes for a frustrating read as the relationship has this almost immature high school quality to it.		I also had issues with the h's attitude towards the H.  She acted way too surprised that he knew of the world outside of Lyndon Valley.  Hello!  Uh, TV, Internet, schools, newspapers etc.  Just because someone doesn't live in NYC doesn't make them ignorant of world events or culture.  While she was beautiful and talented, she wasn't worthy of the H.
1,Grammatical errors, incorrect usage of words, along with no translation of the French sentences made it difficult to follow but it was blatantly obvious that this story was a copy cat of 50 Shades. I'm assuming the remainder of this series will be along the same lines as 50 Shades book 2 & 3 so I'm not even going to bother downloading the next book since I already know the ending. I only finished this book because I was hoping that the story would have a different twist somewhere before the end but alas, it didn't...
1,I did not get past 10pages. Not remotely enjoyable reading and a waste of my time. Luckily for me this book was free.
1,WTF? book one was good and then what happen? the editing? the drawn out flashbacks and the story line was NOT good. Lest echange girlfriends and don't tell them? NOPE where they do that at? Let this go and start something else.
1,Titan needed to develop the characters a lot more.  I didn't feel like I knew them.  I didn't feel the bad boy in main I was told he was a bad boy.  Her best books are Carter reed.
1,Not my kind of book.  Too much preaching about a system that doesn't exist.  With 80 billion people on Earth it's no wonder the majority are morons!  The author creates this fictitious Earth civilization and then complains about how bad he made it!  So, write it differently.  If you really are concerned about some part of Earth's current education system, then write about it and promote any kind of fix you might have in mind.  Writing science fiction isn't going to give you a platform to do much of anything, except make some money if a book sells.		Anyway, back to the story.  You take four or more idiots from Earth (the one you created) and throw them on a sparsely populated planet and expect them to "do the right things"?  Hardly going to happen.  I'm really surprised they all didn't get killed right at the beginning.  I wonder how the book would have turned out if the airplane the main characters were in didn't just happen to crash in the wilderness?  Of course that wouldn't have made much of a story but that's most likely what would have happened anyway.  I don't see the urgency of getting these kids to a farm so why didn't they just load them up on a boat going up river?  And lastly, the bully Barry was so obvious that smart people would have known immediately that he was to stupid to let go anywhere.  After the shooting incident, he should have been locked up in chains and stayed that way until loaded on the next starship back to Earth.		Oh, I really hate these political/social rants at the end of each book.  If you haven't gotten your point across during the book then don't try to explain it further in an editorial or whatever.  And of course, reference the Erin Cox example you gave; you might want to re-check your facts.  You'll find out the young lady, her family and lawyer are all liars.  Erin pleaded guilty in court and admitted her version of the story was made up but you, like everyone else, was quick to scream at the school administration which actually investigated the incident properly.  They acted properly too!
1,Spoiler Alert.		  This novel was very strange and complex without rhyme or reason. The main character, Alex,  is a vampire and detective on the night shift but he can also work the day shift?... His great, great granddaughter is abducted by someone whom he surmises is another vampire, Carlos, but even with his super accentuated sense of smell he does not pick up Carlos' scent in the park and has to rely on an artistic sketch.... really. Yet when he goes by Carlos's home, he is wary that Carlos will pick up his scent. Does Carlos who is younger have a more developed sense organ that Alex? Such inconsistencies throughout the book makes it a very difficult novel to get into and follow. The characters lack depth and throughout the book I kept thinking that Louis would be on Janelle's side and betray them but naught.  There were some editing errors, not many but the few were noticeable. The conclusion was anticlimatic and I still am unsure as to why the ring and Cassandra was needed for this 'apocalypse event' to occur...  as stated it's a very confusing novel.
1,I have read a few of Austen' s other novels, and this has been my least favorite. It was just very boring, and I was glad when I reached the end. Sorry, Jane. I'll take Pride over Persuasion.
1,Retired pro basketball player Jelly Howard was in love, until he walked in on his woman giving herself to another man. Life for him came to end and the man he was, was no more. He became overly serious and reclusive, his life was only made for practicing his other love, Law. Until the woman that stepped on his heart turned up in his hometown, as caterer to the wealthy and elite families he socialized with and a close friend to his sister. His mission was to run her out of his town by any means necessary.	Jorja Strand was tired of running from her stalker. So she found a small town in New Jersey, started the business of her heart never dreaming that it would be as successful as it has become. However, never in a million years did she think she'd see the man that she thought the sun rose and set on. The same man that besmirched her and broke her heart three years ago in the same town. The only problem with that is she had a secret, a secret she did not want made public especially to Jelly Howard. So, hiding from her unlikely stalker and keeping her secret safe, Jorja knew she had some decisions to make. Either put on her big girl panties and handle the situation or let Jelly run her out of town. I love this writer's work I love this series but I cant stand the lead lady she hid his child from him and when he/Jelly said he was going to court the family turn against him every-time a women come in the picture they flip against there family member I feel she should be the outsider I just felt some type of way
1,Well...sometimes being a total addict for biker and motorcyle club books results in me reading things I normally wouldn't pick up. So when I saw this book was free and the blurb sounded promising, I had to give it a try. I figured it could have been absolutely amazing or beyond disappointing. It actually fell somewhere in the middle but much closer to disappointing. The bones of the story were good. The story could have been very good, it just wasn't. It wasn't absolutely terrible. It just wasn't good. I'd give this one a 2.5 stars, more for the potential it had then actual execution. I probably wouldn't recommend this one unfortunately.		Also, beware, there is absolutely no happy ending here. None whatsoever. I'm actually surprised it ended how it did. I'm a stong advocate that romance novels should end with someone getting a HEA. BUMMER!		Oh well, I took one for the team (the biker/bad boy addict team) and read this one so...now we know! I'll go back searching for the next kick-a__ biker romance book =)
1,DNF @ 62%		This was just not my cuppa tea. I'm all for anti heroes, but I really didn't see any redeeming qualities about Ren. He was just an @sshole who treated the heroine like sh! t. Making her get on her knees and crawl because she was making him and his men breakfast? This dude seriously needed a hard kick in the groin if you ask me.		Also, there was no chemistry between the main characters. The sex was OK. Lots of BDSM play if that's your thing. If you're looking for a romance story in here, you won't get one. However, if dark erotica is what you're seeking, this may be right up your alley.
1,There was no real story line. Just talking. Karma n Kings relationship seemed that of high school love which was cute.
1,no se da cronologicamente. El relato es demasiado imposibe. Toca demasiadas lines de accion y no es convincente
1,Just could not read.
1,I thought this was going to be an awesome read! Its extremely fast paced. The female is whisked off in the middle of the night out of her bed to another world and she is automatically taken to the king to have sex. They have sex and in the middle of this when he is having sex with her you find out she is a virgin and enjoying it_ wait so she has been taken from her home in the blink of an eye and mere seconds later she is on a bed with some elven douche pounding away like nobodies business. Well that was some way to lose your virginity  and completely painless as if this was the tenth guy you've had sex with or something. The female lead didn't seem like virgin at all the author seemed to have just threw the word in there to add more words to the chapter. I can't even find myself continuing on to the next books. It's only worth running through the reviews and summing up what happened.  I can't believe this is what it takes just to become a best seller in this day and age. And pretty much she wakes up and he tells her she is going to have his babies and he is already married to someone else!!! That they are now married and yes he is married to someone else. Everything moves so fast and without much of a decent sex scene. There is a plot but it was just executed so poorly.
1,Ok, not terrible but not great. Had some humor in the beginning and might have been better had there been more humor throughout. A little more suspense wouldn't have hurt either.
1,This is a really BAD book. Jake Maddox is a lawman, ready to retire and settle down, who meets Maisie Jane Jackson on a stagecoach that is robbed. He winds up marrying her when she gets in trouble for attempting to shoot the man who killed her brother. There is no plot; I scanned the last half of the book because it was so awful. Jake is written as a male with great sexual stamina and prowess; Maisie Jane comes off as an airhead who doesn't have the sense God gave a goose. The sexual content is bold and there is cursing. The part that really bothered me was the "teaching" of Maisie by Jake. There are spankings all through the book; precipitated by Maisie using words like" lust" in front of Jake, handling his weapons, reading dime novels and being "sassy". She knows when he is going to punish her but the idiot walks up to him and lets him do it anyway. All of this is done under the guise of teaching her to be a good wife; I see it more as a form of spousal abuse. I really regretted buying this book; if this is the type of writing MS has to offer, I wonder how she got the book published to begin with; I will never purchase another book  by this author; DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK!
1,OK read....the love story between blue and	Chrys was so good.
1,Don't know where  good ratings are coming from but this book was very "unAusten" in my opinion.  The author degraded the characters with foul language, hooking up and no real sense of romance developing between them. The well known characters were just there acting out their new 21st century attitudes and actions. The author's contemporary twist was a good idea and one I was looking forward to enjoy. But for me the read became a bit too twisted and very disappointing. To end the misery,after surviving half the book, I asked for a refund.
1,I really wanted to like this book since some ideas were very good advice and inspirational, but using half of the book for the actual book, and then the other half to promote and preview other books in the series or collection was totally depressing.  Just about the time when you're getting inspired, the real book ends...to be continued in the next book or books...say what?  That's so misleading.  The author in creating the books like read this half now, and buy more books if you want to find out the rest, isn't giving the readers any credit for having the intelligence and willpower to just say, "no," to shameless scams designed to make them buy more and more books.
1,Did not like it....to much detail or set up by author
1,I just found it good in the beginning then it got boring.  About a girl that moves with her grandmother she never met
1,This story went from boy meets girl, has hot, sometimes kinky sex, to kidnapping and conspiracy theories. I mean it was a serious 180. I'm sorry but it was just ridiculous. One minute you're reading about kinky sex and the difficulties with having a relationship between two very busy professionals and the next minute you're reading about spies and murder and hiding and running for their lives. What? I thought the series was named The Alpha Group because it would be about alpha males and their love lives in and out if the bedroom or something like that. But no, it's about a secret group with that name and they're made up of men with power and influence and spies? I'm not entirely sure but the whole premise was just ridiculous.
1,Too many errors in word choice and sentence construction coupled with a plodding, repetitive pacing made this more of a chore to read than a pleasure.  Even though the plot was reasonably original, the writing lacked passion and I found it difficult to stay engaged with with the story or the characters.  The entirely too early sex scene between the H/h felt forced and gratuitous.		Bottom line: Good premise, poorly executed.
1,I don't think I ever really "got" this story.  It was confusing and hard to stay with.  And then it was supposed to be explained by a coma?  Needs lots of work to make it a pleasurable read.
1,Where do I start? Hmmmm ......	How about that I couldn't give a rat's behind about the lauded Rockefeller tree. That I think it's a crime to cut down a big, beautiful tree like that so a bunch of city folks can glom decorations on it and look at it for a month. That I was rooting for the tree to win.		Because that's what really lost in this book, is the tree. Oh, the reader lost too, time spent on a mediocre book at best. And they made it a Hallmark movie? Usually they're great movies, but everyone hits a clunker now and then. That's one movie I won't watch.		You have a book with a psychopathic female lead, who's obsessed with the Rockefeller tree. Her whole life revolves around it. The whole scenario with the family is just totally not believable. And yes, the editing is wanting a bit.		I kept reading, hoping that the tree would win and the guy would stand his ground. None of that happened,  and the tree died, and the guy caved.	Sucky Christmas book. I've read tons of much better books.	And in this day and age of being green, this isn't green at all. Surprised at Hallmark.
1,I wanted to like this book, I really did, but it was so confusing. I couldn't just enjoy the read because I was constantly trying to figure out who the heck was who since the author changed from first to last name constantly. At times I thought maybe there was an additional person in the mix, and then after reading some more found out it was just one of the men's first/last name. It was really annoying. The guys are, for the most part, all messed up in some way and it was not explained why. I'm maybe half way through and I don't know if I will finish as the whole story line is super unbelievable. I don't understand how Oriana did such a drastic change in her personality and how Max fell in love with her since they really didn't spend a whole lot of time with each other.		SPOILER:::	I understand that Max likes to watch and all, but he barely spent anytime actually WITH Oriana for them to have a relationship. Maybe it gets better and explained some more further in to the book, but so far it is just a mess of a book.		Like many reviewers have stated, I don't know that it is worth the read. I'm not personally into BDSM, but I have read books about it, however this book is unlike anything I have read. The violence/domination is not necessarily excessive, nothing I wouldn't do with less people involved, but it is not something that came about naturally. Oriana has never had any desire to do anything that they do in the book, and yet she is perfectly fine with it all, including Max getting off on watching everything as well as being involved. Confusing to say the least.
1,If this book was half the length it would have been twice as good.  The book is packed full of action sequences.  But they never ended.  I'm pretty sure one chase scene went on for 50+ pages.  I have never read a book before where the action scenes get boring because they just don't stop.		A few times the writing really pulled me out of the scenes as well.  People can't outrun falling objects when they themselves are falling.  People rarely have time to rip off a pithy sentence or two in the time it takes being seen and for the bad guy to take a shot. The bad guys don't have to be just evil for evil's sake and being deaf for a few years doesn't give you super special sensory powers.  And rarely do people get the crap kicked out of them once, let alone several times a day, and just brush it off.		I always finish books after I start them and this one has made me seriously reevaluate that policy.		It was however, great when I was having trouble falling asleep.  The endless repetition of boring "action" was better than nyquil.
1,This was an interesting little short story.  I'll admit I haven't read any of the other Westervelt novels, but since this seems to be a bit of a side story, and it was available for instant download at ebookfling, I thought I would start with it.		The story was actually decent.  I liked the plot.  The writing seemed a bit elementary, though.  And it could have used a good editor as well.  Also, there was no sex.  I don't even think they kissed.  There was just some vague mention of their "joining" after the fact.  I might have been able to overlook this if there had been any chemistry between the characters or lead-up at all.  But if this book is any indication of the others in the series I need to re-evaluate whether I am interested in picking it up.  It was more like a sci-fi story that had a little romance thrown in accidentally, but again with no chemistry or heat.
1,Not what I expected
1,Another kinky romance, but this time it involves a cougar and a young man who is an...escort? It's actually been a while since I read this and all I remember was that it was okay. The female protagonist was independent and sure of herself until she met a young man that made her start feeling young again with new love. It started off okay at first, but toward the ending it started getting sappy and ugh. I'll admit, I hadn't read a romance involving a cougar, so it kept me intrigued till the end.
1,biased and not enough details of life or presidency, etc.
1,I really wanted to like this book.  The theme should be one that I would enjoy.  The problem is that the characters were not fleshed out enough and I did not care about them.  It was also not believeable in nature
1,This book took a long time to get in to.  The characters weren't very interesting to me.  I felt it was very wordy, and sometimes boring.  I liked the plot but I admit I skimmed through a lot of the book.
1,I don't usually write reviews, but here I go.  There was a story-line, but it was well hidden amongst all the vapidness. I kept finding traces of it as I stopped every few pages to see if the story had "jelled".  Sadly, for me, it didn't, but I kept finding glimpses.  I found the lack of a decisive story discouraging, since I felt that if the author hadn't stretched and padded so much she wouldn't have been distracted from developing it.  This would be a VERY GOOD read for a person who needs to be lightly distracted, say on a plane or a doctor's office.
1,I like sex with my stories but there was just way to much sex.  It's a short story anyways and 65 percent was sex.  The part the wasn't sex was a couple of text message, what four or five conversations they had that was during sex.		Waste of time.  She was to stupid, I just couldn't like her.
1,I liked the story line but when an authur sets up the story where you ave to buy another and another book just to finish the story, either the author is desperate for money and or has no idea how to finish the book. It's a pretty sad thing.  Not all of us can afford to buy a lot of books
1,Yuk
1,I didn't really like this book. Mainly because im not into the forced seduction or forced sex stories in eorica books. Other than that the story was building up to something until those parts.
1,Redundant. It just went on and on. The woman lost her memory and that was it...she never really got it back and the shocker at the end wasn't shocking...it was appalling that she would forget that she had a child. I really was expecting more. Handcuffed to a sheik makes me think...hummm...what did she do to provoke him to act that way. Not the he knows her and he thinks she's faking amnesia.
1,Sorry I just could not get past the first part of this book. I tried several times but could not get engaged in the story and I usually like this type of book.
1,I didn't care for all the wordiness in her writing. Things moved along way too slowly. I probably will not pick up one of her book in the future.
1,Not my cup of tea. He's a man whore.
1,2 stars for effort, and I really liked the premise, but I cannot recommend this to anyone, unless they don't have very high standards for quality writing.		Several things were extremely irritating about this book, but I kept telling myself not to be a snob and give the author a chance. (I assumed this was a first-time novel by an indie author.)		Tense is inconsistent throughout the book; sometimes even using three tenses in a single sentence.	Inappropriate or incorrect words are used, making for odd sentences that you have to interpret to understand what the author meant to say.		The formatting is inconsistent and the paragraphs are double-spaced, making me wonder how long the book would actually be if it had been properly formatted. Here's an example:		____		It would take years for their city to heal.		If ever.	____		Those are separate paragraphs, and the sentence, "If ever." appears on a page by itself. In some places the first line indent is nearly half the width of the page. (If using MS Word to compose, I would recommend 0.3 for first line indent.)		Everyone in the book has the same reaction to the murders, which is, "Oh my God!" and "How could anyone kill innocent people like this?" (Paraphrasing.) One time, a person failed to have the standard response and I was momentarily shocked.		The detective's teenaged daughter is one of the victims of the first town that is attacked. And yet shortly thereafter, he "chuckled to himself" as he thought of something amusing. Life pretty much carried on as normal after the loss of his child, although he did swear he would avenge her. Much of the story is unrealistic in this way. I could see it as a full-length cartoon movie or something, but not a novel I could take seriously.		Another of my incorrect assumptions was that this was written by someone very young.	64 people are killed by snipers in one town, then another, and another, etc. The police have no clues, except for a spent cartridge and a receipt from a gas station. On a hunch, while visiting one of the victimized cities, the detective asks a motel clerk if a group of people had stayed in the motel recently. The clerk says they did, and basically describes a perfect match for the sniper group.		The detective does not think to ask if they have surveillance cameras, and does not even ask for a description of any one of the likely snipers, nor does he immediately call for a police sketch artist. This is the biggest break he could ever hope for, and in a case this huge, he'd want every possible resource devoted to stopping the massacres. So what does he do? He informally asks the clerk to do him a favor and not rent the rooms they stayed in so that techs can come in later and look for fingerprints.		But at the gas station where the receipt came from, he asks the cashier about the surveillance camera, and then asks the young cashier if he can review the footage to see if he can find the person who made the purchase in question. He's working on the worst, ongoing mass-murders in American history and he doesn't get a warrant to secure the video system. He comes back later to find emergency vehicles at the gas station, the video equipment stolen, and the cashier murdered.		By 53% completion, I couldn't take anymore and started skimming forward. It reminded me of the feeling when someone tells a really long bad joke and you know the ending is going to just make you groan, but now you need to hear the ending just to complete the ordeal. I had to find out the punchline to this novel, but I won't spoil it for anyone who wants to read the book or is a fan of the Michael Gallagher series of books.		This book has plenty of good reviews on Amazon, and in response to one bad review, the author seems like a nice guy and recognized the need for editing and was working on it. But it's not just the punctuation and tenses that need work. Each scene needs to be examined and assessed and be re-written. The fact that the author is doing the editing himself explains why the story has all of these faults. The positive feedback from readers is likely the same type of feedback he's getting from friends and family - and all of them are doing him a disservice. An editor is a requirement. Not an option. Someone other than the author needs to go over the book and point out its weak points and flaws. Authors can't always see them because they're too close to the story.		I think the author seems like a genuinely nice guy with a passion for storytelling; I just hope he'll take the time to give his craft the attention it needs so he can really shine.		P.S. If the book was in perfect condition with zero of the problems I've mentioned, it would still be way over-priced. I can buy Stephen King books for less than $7.99. I would recommend a current price of 99 cents, then after it's been fully edited, bump it up to $1.99. (I picked it up on a free promo without previewing it, just on my immediate interest in the plot.)
1,The recipes look easy enough to make. I would have liked to see a few more vegetable recipes in this book.
1,Divided Hearts is a Regency era romance set in the newly formed United States on the eve of what we know as the War of 1812, or America's second war for independence.  Props to the author for that, but that's where the praise ends.		The female protagonist, Lady Judith Hallowell travels to America to visit her father.  There she meets Nathaniel Bellingham, a friend of her fathers and the grandson of a family friend.  The story follows her introduction to America where she develops new perspectives on personal freedom which contrasts to the constraints she feels as a society dame in London.  In a very superficial way the author also touches on the role of women and even more superficially on the issue of slavery in the new country.		My problem with this novel is that I got whiplash from Judith's frequent back and forth rejection followed by heart-felt pining for Nathaniel.  She likes him, she hates him, he's a foppish dandy, then he's a dashing horse breeder, then she loves him, but is he a hero or traitor?  Frankly her vacillating emotions made me weary.  When this soapy tome finally drew to a close in the most trite, unimaginative way possible, I closed it and vowed to be much more selective in my choices of Regency romances.
1,This was way too short. It seems to me that there is much more that might have been included. I also felt that the author was talking down to me. I did get an interesting recipe from the booklet, though.
1,I love historical romances, and have read many over the years.  I had high hopes for this book, especially after trying hard to read three others before it.  The basis of the story is good, young woman returns to her hometown after ten years.  I found it hard to believe that she would remember everything about the town after a ten year absence, especially since she was 8 when she left, and had no family to remind her of all of it.  I found the book hard to read due to the numerous typos, wrong words used (then instead of than), plurals instead of possessives, and possessives instead of plurals.  The author seems to be unfamiliar with compound words (such as schoolhouse, graveyard, and sunlight).  Numerous typos make for a much less enjoyable reading experience.  The author needs a good editor and proofreader.  With self-publishing, books are unreadable more and more.  I offer my services as a proofreader and editor.
1,Poor Prose and Imagination by the Author. She needs to Read Ben Boswell
1,Normally I love Dotts' books, but this one I wish I had skipped. The basic message is something like, "The subconscious is important, so do affirmations and visualizations that give the right feeling."
1,Got to the 20% point and realized I was tired of the authors attitude and of the sadistic descriptions. Somewhat nihilistic.
1,The hero is angry and whiny.  The heroine is sad and self-absorbed.  I couldn't finish it.		mature content
1,I got through 5 chapters and had to quit. There is nothing wrong with the writing, it is just to slow moving. It did not keep my attention. But it kind of reads like a supernatural episode. But still gave it 1 star. Maybe in the future, her writing will get better and she will grab readers attention quicker.
1,This would have been a great book if it had all the words instead of big blocks of text missing. I love this series so this was a huge disappointment to purchase a book that was missing so much. Almost an entire chapter towards the end. Disappointed in this one.
1,I hate weak lead characters!  She couldn't make one decision!  So frustrating.		I didn't believe there was any chemistry either.		Waste of time
1,I was given a free copy of this book by the author.  This is my honest review, given voluntarily.  This is the 1st of 6 books that I have read about the Friessens, and it is the 1st of those 6 books by Ms. Eckhart that I have not liked or wanted to re-read.  I'm sorry to say that unlike my earlier experiences with her books, my emotions were not engaged and I did not feel the angst or the love between the main characters Candy and Neil.  The story felt hodgepodge and thrown together.  I will continue to be a fan of Ms. Eckhart's books and continue to try other titles by her, because I consider one bad reading experience and five great reading experiences out of six to be a winning record!
1,I only really like the funny parts in the story and that is the only reason I finished this book.  Otherwise I would have just deleted it from my Kindle.
1,I am glad this was a free read because I could not even finish  the first book  for all  the bad words and really detail sex. I am sure would have be a good book if writer wrote it different to me it is trash writing. I would have rated  zero stars  but would not let me.
1,Very short. Not good to recommend.
1,This book is poorly researched (wrong photos for wrong thing, facts are off), has little variety (SO much about ticks, why?!?) and poorly formatted (which caption goes to what? are these headings or facts or what?).  You know that a book is not doing well when one complains about the frikkin' formatting, it is like when one notices how bad a movie's ambient soundtrack is (*ahem* Twister *ahem*). One of the "facts", next to a picture of a snake, is "Snakes are among the3 deadliest and most dangerous animals in the world".  What? Which snakes? Yeesh.	I got this book for free in exchange for a review, which obviously didn't influence me.
1,First I hated how much the author used snickered, half the time it didn't seem appropriate. I hated the dynamics between the two main characters. Some of their actions didn't ring true given their past history. If they never dated than how did they get so much sexual experience?	I didn't like how it ended or didn't end. Not one question was resolved in the entire book to include their distant relationship with their parents.	The story was free so I can't ask for my money back but what about my time? I just wasted a part of my life I will never recover.
1,I don't like the fact that I have to give this author 1 star. The idea that the author was trying to betray was really good but it was SO CONFUSING! I didn't know who was talking because one minute its one character then its another character that was even in the scene. PLEASE REWRITE THIS BOOK WITH A GOOD FLOW. THE STORY LINE WAS GOOD BUT THE DELIVERY WAS HORRIBLE. I'm going to try and finish the book but I don't know if I can. If there is a part 2 I will not be reading it
1,Not one of her bests.
1,Annoying  unlikable couple. After one chapter I was skipping paragraphs.	A stupid unbelievable will with a predictable storyline. But they were so jerky I couldn't finish.
1,okay
1,Gentle tale of deserving heroine remeeting genius geek she can't quite remember from high school. Now he's a hero: a sexy marine biologist researcher/ professor who certainly remembers the beautiful wild child Cynthie, who had the attention of all the boys in high school.	Awkwardness isn't one of my favorite traits when it comes to heroes but Max can be steely and strong when necessary. It made for some interesting moments--just not enough IMO. The sexual tension wasn't there for me. I had a hard time finishing it and I've never had that problem with this author's other books.
1,Meh.  I wasn't a fan of the storyline or the characters, personally.
1,It was a re hash of all facts that others had reported on in the past or may be it was just to slow of a  read =doesnt keep your attention....
1,It was like the author decided to create the least like-able heroine ever-and succeeded!  The character Trinity was  weak but like-able in the first Rush Book but in book 2 she was whiny, constantly ill (boo hoo), and just plain stupid.  The author put her in every dangerous situation she could think up and there were a lot (should have saved half for another character in another book!!!). The character would no sooner get out of the hospital then she would start thinking the man who loved her was doing her wrong AGAIN and flee her security detail to jump back into trouble.  There were five different villains after her, most trying to kill her.  Who could blame them?  Half way through the book I wanted to kill her too.  I know it is just a work of fiction but nobody is that stupid so it is impossible to feel connected to the character.  There was nothing in this book to show why the hero was in love with her. Couldn't have even been great in bed since she always had a headache!  I was hoping he would kick her to the curb and get on with his life and a woman with at least half a brain.  Trinity is an insult to women every where.
1,I really couldn't relate to the characters or their lives.  And my favorite peeve the story had no end.  So far it was just depressing.
1,This review is for 46% of the book, cause that is how far I reached before I admitted defeat! If you've read the first book in this series and are gleefully expecting  a continuation the of excitement and spicy bedroom encounters, then hold your breath. It ain't gonna happen, at least not in the first 46% of the book. What you will get is a stodgy, boring rendition of a historical 'romance' that you've probably read before, because the storyline has been done so many times before. Let's see...a young, tomboy who has secretly been in love with her brother's best friend, in adherence to her nature of being outspoken and honest etc. she's thrown herself at the friend, decides to make him notice her by behaving differently, elicits the help of other female characters to bring unsuspecting, dolt to heel...sounds familiar doesn't it?!Again, that's the first half of the book so it could've improved. There are also some things that didn't make sense,  one was when the heroine designed her dress. This dress was atypical of the designs of her era (evidenced by the awe and comments of everyone)yet the author would have me believe that a girl, who was not really girlish, designed such a dress! The 46% of the book that I did read, honestly, is as far as I am going to read. I won't dissuade anyone from reading this, because it is well written. I am just disappointed!
1,I had sone problems with this book. A lot of has to do with there was a much bigger story here, but was shoved into a short story rather than a full length love story. Some things were hinted at, but never really fleshed out. I couldn't connect with the female main character at all. The author tried really hard to establish she was some type of military bad-ass, but none of that really came through.	The relationship was just TOO easy. Imagine YOU went to another place where there are carnivorous plants, shapeshifting hunks, and a big lovable purple wolf...I think youd have some reaction. With this woman things were way to flat and unconcerned. Like "oh ok..thats interesting".	I  think this book had potential. Frankly I went through all the books looking for her sisters Narcissi's story. Now I would have read that. Granted she seems like a real piece of work, but I bet we wouldn't be bored with her..lol.	This book is ok..if you are looking for a free quick read. But don't read it if you are looking to get lost and swept away...
1,Product did not download properly with most of it missing -- I cancelled my order.
1,I Wanted to like this story, I really did. The writer has some talent with words, but needs some more education and experience. When he described the scene where a woman was made into a vampire, supposedly 6,000 years earlier, the surroundings might have been, at the very earliest, the 19th century. For the author's enlightenment, 6,000 years ago was almost 4000 BC. The stone age wouldn't even begin for another thousand years, and he's writing about blouses and living rooms and metal knives.	I realize that there's a deal of suspension of disbelief that has to go on when reading fiction, but this one just took way too much. Sorry, Iceheart, dude, but vampires weren't the only thing about this book that sucked.
1,Ok I've never read a book quite like this one. I did NOT like it at all!!!!! It sure was a waste of money that's for sure.  I don't know if it was because they were young or what but I could not even finish it. I've always finished a book no matter how bad it was but not this one. I had to make myself try and read it but in the end I failed. I would not recommend it to anyone. I didn't even wanna give it one star!!!!!!!
1,Implausible plot. Inane dialogue. However all would be overlooked if the grammar, use of words, and misspelled words, were actually EDITED. A few times I actually had to reread a page to try to gauge what in check was going on.
1,I'm not even sure what to say about this story other than NO! I don't even normally post reviews of less than three stars, but due to the misleading content on this one, I decided to go ahead with the review.		Horribly written, ridiculous, absolutely unbelievable (parents basically kidnap and lock away their college age daughter taking her phone, etc for days on end - no mention of the frequent bathroom breaks necessary for a pregnant woman - lol or the fact that what the parents did was oh... I don't know... illegal!), horribly inaccurate like it's not safe to fly in the 1st trimester of a normal pregnancy? PLEASE! If you don't know something, take 2 minutes to research it. Even the main male character apparently knew enough to research whether it was safe to spank a pregnant woman... *rolls eyes*	Oh and the kicker - she supposedly falls in love with a guy whose only interest in her has been to have sex. That's it. No actual dates (other than one shared meal to start) just "let's f*$&" or "when can we f*#&?" or "I will tell you when, where, and how long we f*$&" Seriously... what's not to fall in love with there? lol Can you hear the sarcasm?		I accidentally read/skimmed the vast majority of this book because the actual story advertised was only a little less than a third of the full page count listed. It is filled with other stories to add/ boost page count in order to get more money (in a sneaky, underhanded way) from Kindle Unlimited. ZERO RESPECT for authors who do this! ZERO! Not only is it false advertising for the readers (your customers), its just an all around reprehensible practice.
1,Starts out like a high-school teen novel, but gets a bit better and has a nice positive outlook.
1,Why turn women into w.h.o.r.e.s.		The wet shorts contest just ruins the book.  So stupid it is unbelievable.  No reason for her to do it.  You don't want her seen but you toss her up on stage so she can look in the crowd men.  Right.
1,but this book seemed so much of a formula book without much depth to the characters.  Everyone is very perfect, if you like that.
1,I enjoyed the story line and the characters.  But it was hard to follow and to read.  Not because of the author so much, as she didn't have a decent proof reader or editor.  Words were skipped, added twice, or the wrong ones used.  Otherwise I would probably have given it a 3 at least.
1,Well I was reading a good love story but now will never know the end as it is another cliffhanger  which I despise.  So if you don't keep buying  books  (actually, they are just short  clips each)  Lily Zante is a very good author so I was  disappointed
1,I am unable to give a recommendation on this book because I did not finish reading the book. I have purchased several books by Ms. Bowers in the past and enjoy reading her books. I could not get into the story.
1,This is the story of Reese, a college professor who is dealing with a missing artifact while sorting out her relationship with her best friend Caleb.		***Spoiler Alert***		There were a lot of issues that I have with this book.  Which, by the way, actually didn't focus primarily on 'The Cuneiform Caper'.  It seemed as though the missing tablet was an afterthought.		First of all, it was really slow and uninteresting.  The characters didn't seem to have any depth and really didn't grab my attention in any way, which made it hard for me to get through the book.		Secondly, the relationship between Reese and Caleb fell flat.  They finally declare their feelings for each other, make out on the floor, then go to bed and sleep.  Really!  After secretly loving each other for years and then finally declaring their love they just snuggle up and go to sleep?  Then, after this they barely have any interaction with each other until Reese finds out that she is adopted and Caleb knew and didn't tell her.  At this point she runs out on him and refuses to speak to him.  Then, after all of this, in the end he finds her and proposes out of the blue and she accepts as if nothing had happened.		Lastly, I had a big issue with the fact that the author didn't keep the facts straight throughout the story.  Days were mixed up, such as Reese mentioning it was Saturday then later that day mentions it was Tuesday.  Now, one or two mistakes like this wouldn't really bother me too much, but there were a string of them throughout the book.  Such as the fact that it is mentioned that her mother walked out when she was 10 and her father died soon after, but earlier at another point in the book Reese states that her father gave her a college graduation present.  Also, Caleb says that he overheard her parents talking about her adoption 12 years earlier (That would mean that she was in her twenties when he found out, which would mean that her mother was still around at that point).  Also, at one point Reese goes on a date with another guy.  She drives to the restaurant, but calls Caleb to help her get out of it.  He shows up and drives her home.  They spend the night together then he leaves in the morning.  She soon follows and drives to work.  How could she drive to work if she left her car at the restaurant?		There are more issues like the ones I mentioned above throughout the book, but the ones I've mentioned are the ones that seem to stick out the most for me.  I usually don't point out all of the mistakes and pick books apart like this when I write reviews, as I know it is not easy to write a novel.  I do give the author credit for the effort she put into writing The Cuneiform Caper.  Unfortunately, there were so many mistakes that I had a really hard time reading and enjoying this book.  I hope that in the future the author will take note of this and take more care when writing and proofreading.  Also, these mistakes should have easily been picked up by an editor.
1,First I have to repeat what many have alredy said: THE .99 CENT EDITION IS JUST A PREVIEW. I like short stories but I also want them to be complete. I think there's a glith because the kindle said there was plenty left in he book until suddeny the progress just shot up at one point.  There is a second edition for 2.99 that I assume is the full thing.		As for the story itself:	Pros: Hot and steamy with funny dilogue and just kind of ridiculous in a good way.		Cons: Not well written and lmost seems like a teenger wrote it. Also the characters are all trashy and the main girl is a complete skank. In a weird way though it al becomes ridiculous in an entertaining way.		Not sure if I'l buy the whole thing. I feel a little put off that the description tried to say it-s a short story when it's really jut a part of a story. Also while I'm not a grammar nazi the book had enough errors to be distracting even if it was entertaining.
1,An Angela Walker Cozy Mystery set in Florida Angie Walker is a few days from fulfilling a lifelong dream of being her own boss. Soon she and her best friend will open a treasure/antique business on Florida's east coast. But as a reporter for the Tequesta Sun, she has one last assignment - interview former boss Frederick Canterly about his five-decade career as publisher of the Madera Beach Tribune. The interview should be a piece of cake, but her former boss very inconveniently drops dead. Police believe he's been poisoned, and detectives find an incriminating vial in Angie's purse. Now instead of opening the door to her business dream, she may open the door to a prison nightmare. With the help of longtime friend and reporter Harry Landon, she begins a desperate search for the shrewd killer who framed her. Canterly made enemies during his time in Madera Beach. Many people hated him, with good reason. Even Landon had an opportunity and a very good motive to kill the Madera Beach publisher. While keeping her eye on her good friend Harry, Angie will have to shift through the evidence and find the ruthless murderer. In doing so she will also become a target. Unless she is careful, intelligent, and ruthless, Canterly will not be the only murder victim in this small, tightly knit community.		There were some things I very much liked about this book.  The author used an ingenious twist to end the book and resolve the puzzle, and while I suspected what was coming, I wasn't entirely sure until just before it came.  In addition, she played fair with her readers, and inserted her hints and clues with subtlety, while distributing just enough red herrings to cause doubt and sidetrack the reader.		In addition, the author has a very lovely sense of place.  She brings life to her setting, and portrays it with sensitivity and charm, making it a place in which it was very nice to spend a mental vacation.		However, although this was a nice, quick little mystery, and certainly an excellent way to while away a leisurely afternoon, I found most of the characters too one dimensional for my taste, and some of the outcomes to the side stories almost to prettily resolved.  The good characters were a bit *too* good, and her main character verged on being a Pollyanna, which detracted from her interest.  The bad characters were, despite their rather delightful villainousness just *too* villainous.		What really detracted me from the book, though, was the rate of speech used by the narrator.  I kept having the feeling that she wanted to cram as many words into as little time as she possibly could, and this rush to complete the book made it less than pleasant to read.  This is too bad, too, because I think that if this narrator took her time, she would give an excellent performance.  Her enunciation was perfect, as was her voicing and differentiation of the characters.		I give both book and narrator 3 out of 5 stars.		I received this book in exchange for this unbiased review via the courtesy of AudioBookBlast dot com.
1,Aging by Design is a dull summary of the classic academic studies on aging and will not change your life unless you have insomnia. It does throw in a few lines of good advice for overall longevity: eat less and exercise more.
1,I have only read "High" and "Higher" in this boxed set before I returned it for refund.  I am, therefore, only commenting on these two novels.  As in so many of these books that are put out for sale these days it seems as if the authors have a check list of that which MUST be included in their writings: sexually repressed virginal or semi virginal (having had only one or two sexual partners) heroine; alpha hero (former Seal, Ranger, or Special Forces) who is now a billionaire; fellatio; cunnilingus; spankings; St Andrews Cross.  Once all of these have been checked off the author can then contrive a plot.  Some do it well, others do not.  This offering falls into the latter category.	I understand that an author must take some liberty with reality but there should be some semblance of that reality before the reader throws up his or her hands and says,"WTF?"  In this story the cause of conflict makes absolutely NO sense nor does the solution to that conflict.  But since the author must, in this case, have a HEA she had to come up with  something.  That something, however, just makes these two novels much ado about nothing (other than having a flimsy foundation for the ever so many, and eventually boring,sex scenes.
1,I don't understand why authors cannot write consistently, epecially when a story is so short. An example, early in the book when referring to D she works in a coffee shop. Megan is thinking about the girl who works in a drug store, and in the next sentence in a coffee shop again. The grammar is poor. Don't these writers have editors?
1,I loved the first two books in this series - they were fun and witty and just so very clever.  I was expecting the same when I purchased Reaching Rissa.  Unfortunately this installment felt like a contractual obligation.  I think the clincher was that entire (yes literally) scenes from the Christmas story were used in Rissa's story (chapter 6 vs. chapter 12).  I don't know if it was a word count obligation or just ennui for the author but it was so very irritating.  I wanted to read the back series (Denver Pack) but now I know I won't even bother with the final installment of this one.
1,This book was nothing but a introduction to the people living in the estates and their background story. So to see what happens after the fire and hopefully more action, you would have to read the 2nd part, if there will be one.
1,This was not a book just pieces of different stories.  You couldn't get into it. I didn't realize that was what I was getting so it was disappointing to keep starting over.
1,Not sure what the book the 4 and 5 star reviewers were reading but it could not have been this book. The writing was all over the place, and the book was rushed. Two stars for starting  and finishing the book but the writer needs to study HOW to write a story and how to write conversation.
1,I LOVED books 1 and 2 in this series so I was anxiously awaiting book 3.  I was so disappointed with it.  First of all, there were SO many typos, I doubt it even had an editor.  Secondly, the first 30 % of the book was so slow with too much time wasted and details given about things that did nothing to further the story.  I don't need to know what Mirella is eating, what color her clothes are or the amount of laundry she has to do.  It was also obvious from the beginning of the book which man she would choose.  This book has almost no steam or sex in it.  The only way it would end with one of the men would be heartbreaking.  I knew this and it was.  BUT the author made it even more heartbreaking with the way the story finally ended.  I'm still emotionally ripped apart by how it ended.  I'm almost hoping the author writes another book and sets the story 5 years down the road to address the way it ended and start a whole other story.
1,Totally boring to me. As a person who doesn't believe in either Heaven or Hell, I didn't get past the first few pages. The scenes and characters the author portrays are unbelievable.
1,This was too confusing and unbelievable for me and I couldn't finish it.  I've read a story from author that I enjoyed in the past, but this one wasn't for me. If you like tough heroines with lots of fast action and little substance you may like this one.
1,I've enjoyed the other books in this series, they're easy reads that allow for some escapism without too much brain power, but this one was just boring and repetitive. It seemed like most of the book was spent rehashing the other books and I found myself skipping pages just to get to the new information. Just read another reviewer's synopsis instead of buying the book and hopefully the next one will be better.
1,Typical sentence--His lap swimming also resulted that he was in the best shape...		Good idea for a story, good victim, couldn't read further
1,This is a mixture of some interesting twists on old fairy tales that are pretty good stories and some of those are apparently preludes to full fantasy books.  Others are mediocre and a couple are simply pointless.  There were a couple that were poorly edited with blatant errors and editing so sloppy that it was offensive.  However, the 3 or 4 stories that I did enjoy provided new author fodder, so given the small price I feel it was worth the experience.
1,This was a story I was waiting for,It seems this story was so rushed. My copy seems to have a lot of blank spaces and errors in it. The story was way to short for me. This was a great Series that went out with a big dud for me.
1,I am still not sure if I liked book 33.	It had a full storyline but not sure I agreed with it.
1,Ashly wouldn't get over being dumped. Jake was annoying and i wouldn't get with him either.	He could have postponed the wedding.
1,The plot had potential but it was poorly executed. It was all over the place, timelines didn't fit, wayyyy too many characters and side stories, the author could have wro te at least two full books based off the sub plots and extra characters alone because it really had nothing to do with the original story. And for all that Shi went through she was still dumb and making bad decisions. How many characters were supposed to be dead or locked up and came back? How many were in comas, it became redundant and boring. Then the Shi/Niema/Dior thing was stupid. Close but no cigar.
1,I can see that the story has great ideas but the grammar and typos... Make me wonder who edited the poor thang... Yes (thang)!
1,Not the book for me... I removed it from my kindle.
1,I can't even begin to comment on the story or characters in this novel first for one simple reason. I cannot believe that anyone who could actually write a novel could be capable of so mangling the English language as to make it torturous to read. Who edited and/or proofread this one? My guess is that process never occurred. The language is clumsy, the syntax changes almost every sentence, there are typos galore, dangling participles, mixed metaphors and words that are so misused that it reads as though English was not the authors primary language. I managed to get through the first half of the novel and simply couldn't continue. As if that wasn't bad enough, the main characters, especially the heroine, are so incredibly unlikable. I usually keep a one-star rating to myself, but this book should come with a warning: "If you're a grammar nerd, English teacher, proofreader or editor, beware!"
1,What if you never left high school? Every year you were still a senior, with the same pimples, the same clothes, for 20 years. All because people wrote in your yearbook "don't ever change". The only way to get out of the curse is by having each person cross it off. But if you can't leave the high school...Finally, Lori the sweet and popular, comes to visit the high school when she cames back for her mother's funeral. Of course something bad has to happen..it isn't just enough to get an X in the yearbook.	It was very short, almost like a synopsis of a bigger book. I do like this writer, just not this particular work.
1,This is an uninteresting and poorly written read. The story-line has no substance, uneven pace and rushed. The main character, NeNe, is undeveloped; therefore, unbelievable. There are numerous spelling and grammar errors throughout. I have to rate this book poor.
1,I thought I was getting a whole book considering how many pages but it's one novella over and over again.
1,This is the first book by Mr. Nolan I've read, and it appears it will also be my last.  I started this story with high hopes, the blurb having caught my attention.  But I can't get past chapter eight.  After chapter two, I kept reading and wondering if soon I'd reach a point in one of the remaining six chapters where Mr . Nolan wrote, "April Fools!  I actually wrote this when I was 15."		Please keep in mind the following comments (and brief introduction) are merely my opinions.  Everyone has a right to their own, so please don't let my opinions stop you from reading this if you want.		This is one of the most inanely written stories I've ever read.  The writing is an insult to any reader who has more than 6 brain cells.		1.  I've never read such stilted and contrived dialogue from adults.	2.  I'm not sure Mr. Nolan has ever heard of point of view shifts.  He head-hopped constantly, including giving the pov of a dog.  Yes, Hank, a dog.  Most often, inexperienced writers would shift pov's every paragraph.  Mr. Nolan has gone so far as to head-hop within paragraphs.	3.  He explains things to us as if we are children.	4.  He actually wrote the following sentence: "At the same time, they both said in unison..."  Afraid we readers don't understand the meaning of "at the same time"?	5.  His characters are caricatures, with no depth, no dimensions.  Most author's characters are really marionettes, doing what the author wills.  But in this case, I feel like I can see their strings.	6.  Most of his characters' motivations can be summed up in their words, "Oh, well..." and some excuse is given for why they did something.		I'm going to stop here, with both the review and the reading of the story.  Good luck, Mr. Nolan.
1,This story was good but it was just to short for my liking.  After reading it I felt like I wasted my time.  This is good if you looking for something short and sweet. I was highly disappointed.
1,A cut and dry and very brief overview of the Sandy Hook situation.  Like another reviewer noted this gives you about a paragraph on each child and their families, favorite colors, etc but no real meat.  I understand there wasn't a lot of information released at that time so I feel like this book wasn't really worth reading it even writing.  What is shocking is a book written by a professor with a dissenting opinion was forced to leave a tenured job and Amazon pulled his book down.  So it really doesn't "pay" to write about this subject at all.  I would recommend doing all your own research and skipping this book.
1,As writing goes, this book didn't inspire me to enjoy it.  The story moved along at a very, very slow pace, and I found it difficult to engage myself in the events as they slowly unwound.  The two characters, though virtual strangers, had a very stilted relationship to the point that it made me wonder why they were together at all, even for the sake of being married.  The names of the characters hindered the reading flow further -- names such as Gojaart and Solomon are not common these days, so I almost felt like this wasn't really a contemporary book at all.  I have to admit I found myself skimming through to see if the story would move.at a brisker pace, but I didn't find that happening.  There were rare, occasional morsels of humor injected into the story, but Celeste behaved like such an emotionless pit of a person that I had a very hard time liking her.  Not sure I'd buy any future works from this author.
1,I don't like writing a bad review. I have great respect for authors, and the hard work that goes into devloping a book. However swear, swear cuss cuss cuss. Maybe if the characters could communicate without swearing like sailors and acting like indecisive toddlers having tantrums? The irony being them as children and teens seemed more mature than them as adults. I wanted to like this book. It had moments that I thought could have made a good story. But the bad choppy plot peppered with swear words and the sex added in that was a Band-Aid for the rest of the story left me feeling like the female lead cared for snack as much as she did the guy she was living/sleeping with, not enough.
1,The Duke has been Jonathan ever since the first story, so why is he now referred to as James in one of the stories?  The baby should have been named Aaron Jonathan Lentz, not Aaron James Lentz.  Don't you people read the other stories?  Besides that, this was one BORING story-- repetitive and tedious at best.	The other two stories were OK but not nearly as good as the original Danby stories.  They put me in mind of a television series that tried to hang on for one more year even though the writers had run out of good ideas.	The most egregious error, though, was not remembering the duke's name.  Inexcusable!
1,This so far has been my least favorite book. I thought I had problems with Trig sharing Ashton with Reaver when she was so broken. Nope Reaver takes the cake, sharing Hayden with a stranger, oh not just any stranger no a rival bikers President. There was no way he knew that man well enough to do that and he claims he loves her? He wants to cut her for thrills so he can get off on her fear? I did change a little after she balanced him out and he stopped wanting to terrify her so much to have sex. But no, not on sharing her with a stranger someone he couldn't guarantee her safety with. He didn't know them and if they had all came in there and wanted a piece, yea he might have killed one or two but he could have died trying if they had been bad people like the other club they invited on their run. Not to mention he had no idea if the guy was clean or not. She had him in her mouth no condom, and we know condoms aren't always safe. The aids virus can get through it. She didn't react bad to what happened because she didn't trust him it was because he came back with blood all over him and grabbed her. He was wrong saying what he said to her then taking Shelly on his bike. I wish she had more spine and made him come to her and figure it out, but no you made her spineless. She was going to marry Andy even after all his cheating because she wouldn't stand up to her mom. And they stole all her stuff (by letting people take it) what is she going to do about it? Why didn't some of the club go kick some butt??? I was glad when Dray spoke up and said he didn't share. That is what love is about. She should have been in a better place before Reaver even suggested that to her she wanted to make him happy.  Tough it was still well written with few grammar issues I didn't take away so much for what I didn't like mostly for where we had unanswered things. The main thing I love about this Author is she gives us a lot of couple time after they hook up.
1,its okay
1,This could have been a better book, Two things wrong,  1. It was too long, filled with too much unnecessary historical data. 2. The ending was the only place where more explanation would have been appreciated.
1,It was not that we written, and kind of a disappointment. Im glad that I didn't pay for it and it was short.
1,Jasinda I KNOW you couldn't have written this MESS!! Please say you didn't...pleeease?  WTH happened?  Great plot concept but LOST story line and such shallow, underdeveloped characters! Did I forget to mention the lack of connectivity and cohesion?!! JW, I rank you high ( Wounded, Falling Into You/Us)...this this crappy story I am afraid has fallen flat.  Take a breather if you must but please, please regroup and come again.  I'll be returning this book, I cant even finish it!
1,It was ok. It was free which helped.
1,I was really disappointed with this book and even more disappointed that the author changed the ending after releasing the book. That didn't make the story better only worse. I hope this wasn't a case where the author felt pressured to get a book out quickly and then rushed and gave incomplete work. I would have rather she take her time to deliver a product that was the same quality as book 1. I knew that it would take a lot to redeem Adriano but I feel like the book failed to do so. He and Simone rarely had a conversation that didn't involve one or both of them jumping to conclusions but never actually talking. I think I am done with this series given the revised ending.
1,Swearing and sexually explicit encounters between unmarried couples. Not a good or particularly exceptional story. Sad that the author couldn't tell a story without swearing and sex.
1,On the strength of his previous books, I will definitely still remain a solid fan of Mr. Walker's; but the only thing I found noteworthy about this book was the synopsis.  I truly hope this type of writing is not indicative of what we can expect in the future from one of the most dynamic writers I have ever had the privilege of reading.		This plot, along with the characters, was very dry.  Felt like the author wasn't really vested in them himself.  None of the fire for which Mr. Walker is famous, was infused in the make up of either the hero - Marquis, or the heroine - Nya.  Yes, the characters involved were involved in a relatable life like situation - man rises to the top of football fame, forced out by life threatening injury, goes whacko before regaining his sense, uses degree in education to teach and coach girls basketball team, falls for parent of one of the team members, becomes embroiled in her domestic mess, almost loses a part of himself again because of it, finally gets woman, after 90% of book we get a glimpse of a lukewarm sexual introduction.  Too damned little, too damned late.		Please, Mr. Walker, come back to us with the quality reads you have gotten us accustomed to receiving from you.  I have read and written numerous 5 star reviews on your books.  Your name always receives automatic 1-click downloads to my iPad: just as this read did; but this one was a great disappointment.		Oh well, I am now off to read "Blow by Blow" and pray that it will be a reintroduction into the greatness I have always perceived your writing to be.  Forever your fan, I remain.
1,I wanted to like this - I love her other stories. I hated this. I just can't stand these types of stories. The heroine denies her true mate, has a secret child and he sleeps with countless women in her wake. For me this the opposite of romance and given the painful angsty past it leaves no room for a true HEA. Too much damage is done in the past. I hate it when authors write these - just leaves a bad taste for me.		Loved the other books in the series - just not this one. It's one of those books I wish I hadn't.
1,Disclaimer: The fact that I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review has not affected my rating.		First of all, I would like to thank the author for providing me with a free review copy. However, since this is an honest review, I apologize for my negative words, and am in no way trying to disrespect you.		I was really psyched by the description of this book - it's pretty rare to have a contemporary YA book set in the Amazon. I suppose I was expecting something along the lines of naked natives in tents. To a degree, this is true, but unfortunately, the writing and plot style of this book wasn't for me.		Let me start off with what I liked - mainly the setting of the book. As I said before, a contemporary YA book set in Amazon is pretty rare, and seeing a tribe there was unique and held some of my interest. I liked reading about the trees, tribes' rituals, and beauty of nature!		However, the main thing that put me off  was the fact that despite being away from the Amazon most of her life and knowing almost nothing about the Guardians or her heritage, Julia was able to master her abilities and be considered very powerful, very easily. I was hoping to see her struggle or grow a bit, but this did not happen.		WARNING: SPOILERS.		Moreover, there was the dreaded triangle trap. I suppose I'm sick of it by now, but if used effectively, I might not have minded. However, Julia, Gabriel, and Yoji pretty much all fell to insta-love. I didn't see much of their relationships developing; just a lot of heated cheeks, wistful or annoyed looks, and mind reading. But what really put me off was the fact that Julia was so repulsed at Gabriel because he was an alien =__= Maybe it's because her relationship with him to begin with wasn't that developed, but if she was really in love with him as she claimed to be, why wouldn't she choose him? I remember in another YA PNR book, when the protagonist found out her love was an alien but couldn't be with him because of the rules, she fought and became accepted into her society through her own will. That would be how you show your love. Other than that, there wasn't much chemistry between Julia and Yoji anyways (she even mentioned him being like an older brother...) - how could she consider him to be a suitable lover?		END SPOILERS.		The writing style also didn't suit me. When I was reading, I found that many of the "clues" the author left were so, so obvious - it was practically pointed out. There was almost no mystery for me - I predicted the ending a few chapters ahead of the "climax". Quite a few spelling and grammar mistakes were also made - I might be being a tad picky because I just came back from an SAT English class, but the way I imagined Julia's voice put me off, especially since some of her thoughts seemed to eloquent for a teenager.		Overall, this book wasn't for me. If you're sick of insta-love and love triangles, skip Swirls. However, if you don't mind them and are looking for a PNR book with a unique setting, go ahead and read it.
1,The  bookly was poorly written. The moment he placed the defendants name before the State...I knew he did nto know law. The prosecution is always first- The State of California vs. insert defendant's name here. He definitely needs a proofreader and Beta readers to improve this.
1,Should have read the sample...Would not have purchased it...Not a good read...Skipped most of it, just couldn't get into it.
1,just ok.  the second story ended before it was really finished.  Much too short.
1,Porn science fiction with societal comments written for a 9th grade creative writing class by someone who trusts spell check too much! Feet for feat?? and nonsensical sentences? Garbage - save your time
1,This book wasn't necessary, unless its purpose was to make Tabby more unlikeable. But what I hated about it was how the writer introduced a darker sexual angle to it and then made it seem like Noah had the problem. Tabby was the one who wanted him to treat her rough and basically degrade her - she had the problem. Noah was ambivalent but his instinct was to resist doing it. Wow. What a jerk for NOT wanting to treat the woman he loved like crap!		The whole rough sex/BDSM/Dom-Sub thing is so overdone and you literally can't escape it anymore. I decided to read this series thinking I would escape that 'element' with younger characters. I'm not prudish, but I'm just so tired of the same theme and it honestly boggles my mind. I can't fathom that so many readers find degrading sexual control hot, and super dominant,  possessive male characters desirable. I'm grateful it was more hinted at in this story and the writer didn't get graphic with it, but the damage was already done. I loved Noah in the first book but this book ruined him for me. When Tabby actually threw a tantrum because he wanted to make love rather than treat her like a dog, I was done. I skimmed the rest. I'm sorry I wasted time and $$ on this writer.
1,Spoilers:  This book was terrible.  The main character Diana is an idiot who blunders her way through one dangerous experience after another.  Her boyfriend isn't much better.  These 2 r supposed to be in love but they sure don't act like it.  They tell each other I love you and then get into a childish argument (usually about her safety and her lack of concern for same) and walk away with the old we better walk away so we don't say anything we will be sorry for.  Diana is supposed to be a psychic but she is totally fooled by one guy and gets into the limo with another that she KNOWS is a bad guy, gets drugged and returned to her apt where she remembers nothing, has a dream where she is the center of a satanic ritual and is likely raped and then goes to his house for dinner the next day.  WHAT?  This author needs to do research bc there were so many things wrong with the references to satanism, wicca, witch, pagan, what have you.  I am not spending more time on this, it is the 2nd review I have done and I used too many quote marks on the first.  I am not reading this author again bc I don't see Diana getting any smarter.
1,This book went left for me! I thought Fame was going to be totally different than the character he portrayed. However, I did like the first two books, so I will read the next installment.
1,I liked the characters and the general plot.  I didn't like the lack of background, the lack of depth, and the resolution was too easy.
1,My grandfather was a big Zane Grey fan, as such I read a few myself. Although this was modern adventure thriller, it read much the same.
1,This is a difficult book to even write a review on, as I had an issue with nearly every part of it.  The blurb is good, the title is good, the first chapter or so of the book is good.  But it all goes dramatically downhill from there.		I was intrigued by the blurb, and the obvious idea of a Tarzan story reimagined as erotica.  I was expecting quite a dark tale, maybe even darker than I wanted to go.  What I got was pages, and pages, *and pages* of Zach's internal monologue wavering from borderline sappy to just-entered-puberty teenage boy.		The male lead, Zack is not uncivilized, nor is he very dominant.  What he *is*, is fairly misogynistic, although even that is tempered all throughout the book.  It read to me as though--beginning around chapter two--the author was actively trying to pull back and soften his character.  And for what reason?  At that point he had not yet even lived up to the hype of the book description.		The female lead, Moira is no better.  She comes across alternately as wishy-washy, sex-starved, and/or lacking in intelligence.  I spent much of the book wondering if she had a clue as to what her job was actually supposed to be, because she certainly wasn't doing much of anything.		One of my main issues with this book is that it sets a bad example of erotica.  This genre does not have to be synonymous with bad porn, or lacking in credible storyline.  There was quite enough spark in the inspiration to have made this a very good novel, it merely needed intelligent choices and detail.  Sadly, that was not to be the case.  One quite glaring example was it appears that the author has no idea what an anthropologist actually does.  Or why one would not use the term "Indians" in place of, or in exchange with, "indigenous peoples".		In conclusion, this book was something of a disappointment as it definitely did not live up to expectation.  Indeed, if the reader mistakenly takes the time to think about any of what is being read the entire plot falls apart.  There is just too much missing in terms of character development, background, and any sort of a believable storyline.
1,Minus 5 stars		I've not come across such an awful intent for a story ever. Total waste of time & money. Words fail me to describe truly how bad it was
1,You know maybe I should have read the full-length vampire romance MUST LOVE VAMPIRES. But you know what even with out reading it, I found this to be a nice fast little read! And I did enjoy reading it.		But know I think I might want to read Must Love Vampires.
1,This book did entirely too much. I skipped through the stuff to get to the end and it was just sad smh. Couldn't give a summary if I tried.
1,These four Novellas were ok. The first one was different than s anything I normally read and the last 3 were very simple writings. Nice and quick but nothing special.
1,these short stories are just rewritten stories. you can find all in the old testament. job, jonah etc. really felt like it was a waste of time to read. if you like reading repeats of stories rewritten again and again then this book is for you.
