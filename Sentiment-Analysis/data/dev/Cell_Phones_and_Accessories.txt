0,I wanted to wait for a month or 2 so I could review this properly.  The first one I received had a defective usb port on the 2.1 side. I put in a claim and got the new one very quickly. I like that this will charge my phone about 3 and half times. It feels solid but I would buy a case because if you ever drop it I don't know how well it will hold up pretty heavy. I have several different types of chargers but this is the one I always take with me if i will be gone all day. This charger comes pretty close to holding a charge as they advertise. For the price you need to have one even if it isn't your daily charger. I will see how this holds up over time. My previous powergen chargers lasted several years and i used them daily.
0,Great for the price! The screen protectors go on very well and without too much hassle. Its nice that 5 come in a pack in case you have any trouble or if the screen protector becomes damaged at any point you have extras. I put this on my Samsung Galaxy s4 the day it arrived and it has been on ever since. The only thing that I would say I don't like is when tiny air pockets/bubbles get under the screen but it has always happens eventually with any screen protector.
0,Gave this as a gift. It's super thin I'm told and it has been dropped a couple times and no scratches.
0,ultra premium quality cables, with rugged/durable casing, yet flexible and visually appealing. nice felt travel case, nice colors.
0,I have to be on verizon because of my job. So I was looking for a powerful phone for this network. I wanted stock android without the annoying extra software from both the network and the manufacturer, as these software usually runs on the background using your battery and RAM memory. That brings me to my last criteria, at least one gigabyte of memory.	This phone fits the bill. I got an used one because my 2 year contract is in the middle of it, so I have to buy full retail price.  So far so good. I should say, this is the best android phone I have ever had. I want to upgrade, but I don't think any of the new phones both android and IOS have enough new tech to justified any of them at full retail price. So I will wait until June 2013 to get the contract discount and hopefully a way more advance phone.
0,Although cheaply  made, product held up well. Bluetooth works perfectly. and phone stays on tripod tightly.
0,We have a decorative water fountain in our lobby at my workplace. I would turn it on when arriving to work and shut it off after my shift. Some nights I would be tired and forget to turn it off. The water would evaporate overnight and the fountain would be low on water. The Enover 7-day Programmable Plug-in Digital Timer works perfect. We set it for every day of the week to match our opening and closing times. We plugged a power strip into the digital timer and it also turns the light that shines on the fountain on and off at the same scheduled times as the fountain.
0,Exactly what I was looking for in a phone case.  I'm not big on cases for my phones, but I wanted something to protect the glass on the back.  This case is perfect; it's very thin, adds pretty much no weight, and bonus: it adds a little bit of friction for holding onto the phone.  I have the Aluminum version of the 6P, which slipped out of my hand easily.  This case makes it easier to hold.  It doesn't interfere with any of the buttons or ports or cameras.  I also have a Tech Armor ballistic glass screen protector, and this case doesn't interfere with that at all either.
0,Awsome 2 in 1 cable. Good quality.
0,Love Otter box, great cover for keeping phone safe!  Otter box is the best out there.  Same item as the stores, much better price on amazon.  My husband likes the clip for his belt/pant while at work
0,easy to install and brought my old Lumia 1020 (bought a week or two after release) back to life!	normally I buy parts through a dedicated parts vendor, and this was faster shipping, cheaper and better packaging.
0,Excellent
0,Perfect. Exactly what I ordered and needed.
0,This case looks stunning and really protects my phone. While I was waiting for my screen protector to come in I dropped it a couple of time and the case held up really well. The lip around the case really protected my phone well.
0,This one piece is a great device.	Pros:	Charging multiple device in one shot.	Tried this Ravpower with multiple options, i connected one samsung phone, one iphone 6s plus, one smart watch, and one iPad air 2 sometimes instead of watch I have tried iPad air		Performance:	All devices gets charged without a fuss.	With full load or one device connected its same charging time.	The build quality is great.	Packaging is premium.	Descent Price.but there are some qi chargers at this price.	Doesn't get heated any time.		Time:	Comparing to my oem chargers, this one charges a little faster.		Enhancements may have:	It can have a built in wireless pad above as it matches the size and has the power. For qi type charged it will be awesome.		Well be trying ravpower battery pack and review soon.
0,It just works, no drama.
0,I love the power you can get out of this power bank. It's HUGE!!!! With tons of power. My coworker and I charge both his iPhone 6 plus and my s7 edge for at least 3 days with out a worry of looking for a wall outlet or a fast charger for me. I love this thing
0,I bought 4 of these. I tested them in pairs, in all combinations, on the same outlet.  I was able to get around 78 Mbps of throughput using iperf (a throughput testing tool) between two Linux machines.  I was able to do a 1GB file transfer in 1m45s (76 Mbps) using scp between the two Linux machines.  The next step is to move them to locations in the house where I need them then I will run some tests again and update my review here.		One thing of note is that I never had to use the Group button to sync them up.  Each device automatically learned to talk to his peer and a ping test that I was running would resume.  I unplugged and replugged them many times as well.  Most of the time my ping would resume in 3 seconds but sometimes it would take as long as 10 seconds.  I went ahead and synced them with the Group button anyway but it didn't seem to be necessary.  It made no difference in any of the tests I did.		These things "just work" which is awesome.  I've been using TP-Link devices and those things will stop working for no reason until I unplug and re-plug all four of them which is a real hassle.  That happens at least once a week.  I'm hoping these do not have that problem.
0,This sticker sheet was a little something for everyone.  Was we all know kids like change and adults like to be different and sometimes a little cool too, this sheet of button stickers keeps everyone happy.
0,Quality is good, arrived timely; item as advertised.  Would purchase again from this seller.  Bought as a gift for grand daughter	around latter part of April or early part of May; she hasn't taken it off her phone since.
0,ADDED additional comment below this COMMENT !!	Got for my granddaughter. She liked the case but It did not hold up the card slots got 'lose' and cards wouldn't stay in their slots.  Stopped using.  The color was great and she got compliments on it.
0,For the price it's hard to beat this little guy. I've had it for a little over a month now and the charge definitely holds up. Small and portable, just the way a backup battery should be. I've used it on multiple phones(saving nieces and nephew from dead batteries), bluetooth headsets, a PSP, tablets. You name it this thing had handled it all with ease. Tough little guy too. Probably would have gone with a matte finish as the gloss attracts fingerprints like crazy. Pair this guy with a keychain USB cable and you're good to go.
0,Well designed case . Exactly  what my wife was looking for in a case for her phone. Can't find a better one for the price.
0,Been using this case for a few days now on my phone and I love it, I like how simple it is so your phone doesn't seem so bulky. It provides protection to the back so it won't get scratched but it also allows you to actually see the phone which I like because I have a gold iPhone. I received this on discount for review but my opinions are my own.
0,Nice case. Rubber loosens over time.
0,I really liked the design of this mount, it is one of the nicest out there. Unfortunately, the small adapter doesn't spread wide enough (without pulling it apart completely and exposing the springs) to hold my Nexus 6. It would have worked for a couple of days I'm sure, but after removing the phone several times I could see it breaking. I returned it. But for any smaller phone this thing would be perfect. It's as stable as anything I've ever used.
0,Been using for a few months now. Yes a few of the stones have fallen off but to be honest I expected pretty much everything to have fallen off by now and just a few actually have. Also, in most cases the stones that did fall off were due to some of my accidents rather than poor quality. Overall this case turned out much stronger than I expected.
0,Very impressed w the price. Going to get one for my daughters new phone. I pd more than double the cost at Sprint for my sons phone. I've already dropped my phone once and it didn't break. So I'm happy w the purchase.
0,I love this case. It meets by expectation in every aspect. The delivery is also fast. I would like to recommend this product to friends.
0,This a great case. It fits my iPhone well, I like the soft material in the inside of the case that help prevent scratches. The cut outs are exact and you don't need long nails in order to reach the vibrate switch so that's a plus. Also this case does not interfere with signal strength which is another plus. The case is very slim and stylish and not slippery which I was afraid of. Works well with my all black tempered class screen protector.  I would buy this case again. I recommend it to anyone needed a slim case
0,Great case. I have had many and this one is the best
0,Love it!
0,This is my third time purchasing from Skinomi, meaning the 3rd screen protector for 3 different smart phones.  I did have an armorsuit screen protector, but it didn't hold up as well as Skinomi.  The price is amazing too.  The screen is easy to put on and works exactly as they say it will.  Great buy!!
0,Above all I'm happy with my new case.  May buy another one to have an extra one.  A bit flimsy in the charging port.  Lifts the whole bottom when I open it but that's the only issue.
0,Best case i have had for this phone! Fits the htc one m8 perfectly!
0,This is a very nice case.  The silicone and hard plastic combination provide good drop protection without making the phone look like a tank.  Fit is perfect.
0,I bought this initially because it was being released on the the same day as the Note 4. I didn't want to be carrying around an  $$$$ phone without a case and this was the nicest I could find. At first I thought it might be too thick but I love the way it feels in my hand. The card storage does add  a bit of extra chunkiness but this is good for a few reasons. Firstly, it adds a ton of rear drop protection and keeps the camera lens deeply recessed out of harms way. Secondly, I love the card slot! Didn't think I'd use it but now I keep my ID and debit card in there and very rarely carry a wallet anymore. The component cut outs are beautifully sized. I have no problem getting headphone jacks to fit and I can fit my whole honking pinky in the S pen slot with ease. The rocker buttons feel great and whole case has a nice soft hand to it. Front lip protrudes just enough to safely recess the screen so you can keep the phone face down on hard surfaces without fear. If you can get past the few extra millimeters this case adds on the back you'll find this case has no equal for value and utility.
0,absolutely love it I'm thinking about ordering the brown one I have the lime green one fits cards and money
0,This is an excellent vehicle charger for all my USB devices. The ability to do native USB-C, USB and Anne's excellent product reputation was the driving reasons for my purchase
0,7/18/16	I am only at unboxing, it is charging, but this is initial review.		This is not my first ZeroLemon.  S3, Note2 are my predecessors.  This seems no different.  Besides no removable battery, this is as close as you can get to the same style.  Clip on case with TPU wrap around case.		I have also purchased the Incipio offGRID 3700mAh with Qi Charging and have been using that for roughly 3 weeks now.  It is nice, but the ZeroLemon ZeroShock feels much nicer (again initial review, not gotten to put it on yet as it's going through initial standard charge).  It is bigger, but not by much.  I have dropped the Incipio and it has snapped apart and in one case, the phone flew out.  I know this won't happen with this one as it's the same style as my last ones that survived countless abuse.		This is not like the ones I've seen in videos with the "u" connector to connect the battery and phone as it's a solid piece, also i need to look into a belt clip.  I'm one of the few it seem to use them, but for office use, I love them.  This actually looks nicer than I expected and have seen.		The only plus's I have for the Incipio is the wireless charging, and even that isn't a rapid charge wireless.  I do kind of like the soft round of these back of the Incipio case as well.		I will do MUCH more edits to this as I use it. I had many more pictures, but limited to 20.		Day 1 Grade: B (anticipation and time of charge is killing me!)	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	7/19/16	Put the case on after an overnight charge.  The TPU case is nice and snug!  The phone went from feeling like a TOY out of the box, to a respectable phone with the Incipio, to a VERY secure and well protected beast!		Few initial thoughts:	1. I am unsure what the gripe about the flaps not staying shut as they have little "tabs" to hold them shut.  They seem like they would hold up just fine.	2. There is front facing speaker "ports" on the bottom.  I am unsure why there is one on the left as it does not connect to the right side at all through a channel or anything.  Maybe aesthetics?  There is a few speaker holes at the bottom as well.  I've yet to really try to crank the sound with this case on, but looks like it will be more than adequate.	3. There is the recessed 3.5mm headphone jack.  I am wanting to find an adapter that sits flush with the case so I can just leave it in and still use any headphone (rarely do as I find myself using bluetooth FAR more often), but the adapter that comes with this is just odd (Incipio case comes with the same cable).	4. All buttons are very "substantial" as they rightly CLICK when you press them.  Both Volume buttons, Power button, as well as the Battery button on back.	5. I'm still torn on if I like the LEDs and button on back or front.  With Incipio, I wish they were on back as the wireless charging means you see the bright LEDs all night.  With this, I don't need to worry about wireless charging, so I can keep the screen face down as I had in other cases, but now these LEDs are on back.  This will require more digging to see which I like.  It almost seems as I wish they were reversed -ZeroLemon on front and Incipio on back.  BUT with this case, I don't need to worry about blocking the sound if I do lay face down at night (as I had previously mentioned), there are speaker holes on the bottom (as well as front facing).	6.  Case feel is VERY beefy!!  I no longer fear a drop as I did with the Incipio!  I do with the bottom "bezel" looked a bit more high end as it looks cheap almost.  That however, is the extent of my "gripe" as I LOVE the size, look, and feel of this case.  I'm not sure why, but I LOVE the "ZEROSHOCK" etched into the right bottom side of the TPU case.  I normally hate more logos, but it's done just right!  Hole at the top for the microphone is perfectly aligned as well.		More review to come as I get to use it more.  Initial thought at this point: FLAWLESS, save no wireless charging or belt clip.		Gay 2 Grade: B+	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	7/20/16	I have gone through my initial phone battery and now seeing how long I can go without touching a charger.  I am a HEAVY user, charging my phone every night, all night.  But this time I want to see how long this will last with actual, heavy use. l also do proper "taining" for battery cells -Charge 100%, use 100%, repeat.  This does make a difference!  When wife and I both had extended batteries (ZeroLemon) for our S3's, I would get 1 1/2 days regularly with heavy use, if she made it one day it was a feat... because she did not cycle her battery as you should.		Now for my continued thoughts and findings:	*When charging from the battery, the LEDs stay lit.  This was kind of useful when walking around a dark room and not wanting the blinding camera LED, but I do wish they went dim.  This is a very minor "gripe".	*Sound is very nice out of this with the bottom and front facing speaker "grills" (although still unsure why the left front facing one is there)		I have emailed support inquiring about a belt clip as well.  That, to me, is a big one!  I love the belt clip, especially while in the office and running back and forth.  Not to mention its use as a stand.  *I have tried my Note2 ZeroLemon belt clip, it is right depth and length to fit the phone, but Note2 is too wide.  SO CLOSE!		Day 3 Grade: B+	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	7/21/16		Got 2 full days of GPS to and from work, with BT streaming, LOTS of surfing.  Just normal use.  I got 2 FULL days (up at 6, bed at 11).  Roughly 2 full charges on initial run.  Quite pleased.  That said, I did notice the charging flap issue a bit after all night of charging.  It is closing fine, but had to leave it pressed in for some time before it would stay.  Odd for their products as the previous ones I've had held the flap shut with the case holding it snug in the "ridges".  This version does not have those on either side of the tabs.  Put those back in and this goes away!		Also, I decided to put a screen protector back on.  "Galaxy S7 Screen Protector Glass (Full Screen Coverage), amFilm Bye-Bye-Bubble Samsung Galaxy S7 Tempered Glass Screen Protector [NOT S7 Edge] Case Friendly Screen Protector 2016 [Lifetime Warranty] "  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CDVZAH6/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1	is the one I use.  GREAT CS, good item, has fit with every case wife and I have used (4 total).  This fits this case with ease.  I recommend putting it on AFTER the case to help perfectly align it.		Day 4 Grade: B (flap is annoying)		------------------------------------	Update 4/16/17	Had issues with the charging of the unit, randomly not charging but 1/2 charge overnight.  New car has Android Auto, which confirmed the USB port bouncing between connected and connecting so fast my eyes couldn't keep up.  Notified CS of this issue although will past warranty I believe.  Never had an issue with their previous cases :(		------------------------------------------------	4-21-17	So CS worked with me, head me send the bad case back to them and they sent me a new one!!  9 months after purchase and still had no issues swapping for me bc after I explained what was happening and charging methods.		I love this case, I love the customer service!!!		Oh, by the way, wife inherited my Incipio case. She dropped it and smashed the power button while the phone went flying out of the case. What a joke, none of that would happen with this beast!		-------------------------	5/17/17	New case charging fine, but still not working with Android Auto past 5-10 minutes, even after they swapped for me.  Did countless hours of research top correct this and came up empty.  Worked with support and now told: "Well, please note that the battery case does not support OTG function.		So we suggest to remove the battery case first before you need to transfer data."	Disappointing to say the least. Case is amazing, customer support is awesome, no OTG function is the heart breaker for me.  Still my primary case, but I guess I will have to remove it on longer trips (like up coming family vacation) to use AA.
0,Fabulous case, a bit hard to put on but it works amazing. I've dropped my phone numerous times screen first, still intact
0,Perfect protective case. I've bought and abandoned probably 6-7 cases since buying my iPhone 5S this summer. Those that are "rugged" are ugly and cumbersome. Another major irritation is that most cases obstruct the Touch ID feature on the iPhone. I don't like cases with hard plastic shells because they tend to slip around. Most days I do work in our tree farm, and I've had a phone slip out of my pocket more than once. Or slip off the arm of a sofa. This case has a protective silicone inner shell to absorb shock and a hard outer shell with anti-slip coating. The home button is fully accessible (for touch ID.) Plus the design just feels good in your hand. Can't recommend it highly enough. Only quibble, the anti-slip feature should be featured more prominently.
0,This case came immediately and fits like a glove
0,Great product at an excellent price.
0,good quality, and the magnetic clasp works effortlessly
0,Wrong color, but got it fixed. Great product
0,Protects my phone.
0,This is all you need... you can grip it and its not to thick either. Well made.
0,The item has very good quality to it. It is as close as to smudge free out there I had on other screen protectors for a lot more money.	Item is worth every penny.
0,Love this! Great buy! good transaction...
0,I LOVE THIS CASE.  I was chosen by the seller to receiver this product for free to try and than leave my review on t	Galaxy S7 Case, Bastex Heavy Duty Slim Fit Hybrid Rubber Silicone Cover with Bling Rhinestone Premium Dual Shock Phone Case for Samsung Galaxy S7  by  Bastex .  This item came really quickly after I placed my order from the seller.  This product looks just like the picture.  This product claims to Finally, style meets protection while being reasonably priced! Made with two different components, it provides excellent shock absorbing capabilities. Two components are made with soft silicone material and hard plastic for both flexibility and safety. It offers both great textural feeling and solid protection.  The inner silicone component of the case ensures an impeccable fit on the device and secures your phone for stability. I find that this statement is true.  This product is made very well.  It is very simple to install, simply snap on or snap off. This case is very carefully designed to simultaneously keep your phone safe and still provide easy access to each and every port of the device.  It is very easy to access the ports when I need to attach my headphones.  I love that is 100% great fit guarantee!  The seller Guarantees that  if this case fails to fit your Samsung Galaxy S7 to your full satisfaction.  They would be happy to offer you an immediate replacement at no cost to you. I love that guarantee that means they stand behind their product.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a GAlaxy S7 case.
0,great buy
0,One of the best features about this stick is its size. And pairing it is fast and easy.	Also one thing I really love about this is the simple click of the Bluetooth button built into the handle of the  selfie stick. It holds the phone really good. So far this is the best selfie stick I've ever had."
0,This was a gift. I'd have to say I'm impressed. Came as described. He loves it. It works great so far. Seller is awesome. Keep up the good work. 3 thumbs up
0,Excellent
0,High quality air vent car mount for phones.  This car mount actually mount on the vent and does not just clip on or slide on to the blade of the vent.  There's a U shape at the end of the mount that acts like a hook to hook into the blade of the air vent.  The spring contraption that you see in the picture will act as a clamp to hold the mount to the air vent blade.  Over all, very good mount.  There's a little getting used to as far as the phone clamps, but once I figured out the right amount of force and angle, they work just fine.  Very very good for long trips.  I especially love the little details, like the padding on the legs of the mount, the two edges at the bottom that helps to keep the phone in place.  Good ideas, good designs.		I HAD RECEIVED THE ITEM FOR FREE/AT A DISCOUNT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN UNBIASED HONEST FEEDBACK.
0,Really nice! It fits the charger port better then the original one. Very good quality! I'll keep them!
0,Perfectly packaged and is worth every penny. The colors are a great bonus but the protection is what makes me extremely happy. Working in construction, the faceplates keep the edges of my watch scratch free. Changing colors to match my clothes or phone case for the day is a BONUS
0,As expected, good price  and fast delivery.
0,They are good but the white one gets dirty...but i loved dem
0,Love it!  Bought a spare to carry with me.  We have several around the house.
0,Very good quality! Came faster then expected. Fits my iPhone 6 Plus with a UAG case very snug.
0,I'm not sure how I ever lived without it!!!
0,Works great. Fast charge on a cigarette lighter. Couldn't be happier with this purchase..
0,work as expected
0,I have always loved Spigen products. I can only assume this product will deliver as has all of the other products I've bought from Spigen before. I do hope in the future they will develop a glass screen protector that offers full coverage for the new iPhone 6/6 plus. This screen does only covert the I initial flat display portion and does not envelop the entire screen to the very edge of the curved area. For now I have happy with what I can get.
0,Love it
0,I'm loving this plan. Everything is running smoothly.
0,Excellent Product... content and satisfied!!!
0,Excellent cover.
0,My fiancee likes it on her phone. I have heard really great things about these screen protectors but haven't used one personally. I also am a fan of the anti-glare which I am using my phone as well. These are a little harder to put on then normal screen protectors so if you aren't skilled at them, then it might be worth having someone who is do it for you.
0,Great buy
0,This replacement glass is as good as the orignal glass! I would definitely recommend this as a cheap alternative to paying $150+ for a replacement LCD and glass assembly. Just take your time when separating the glass from the digitizer and don't use an excessive amount of heat. I repair these phones as a business, and I would recommend this to anyone who has the patience and dexterity to repair their own GS3.
0,This is a beautiful case and it has lasted very well thus far. Bought it for my mum as a protection for her phone. It has done it's job of protecting the phone perfectly well.
0,I did a lot of research to find a case that was reasonably priced, well constructed, and provided reasonable protection.  I don't use my phone in difficult environments, so I didn't feel the need to spend $$ on a heavy-duty case.  This case seems to provide good protection for normal use, does not add a lot of bulk, and fits well.  It was easy to install the phone - I don't expect to have to remove the case, but I don't think it would be difficult.  The case has a nice texture to it and will the phone will not slip from your hands.  All in all, a good value.
0,Placing screen was a breeze. Fit perfectly. Only time will tell how tough it is.
0,This was a gift, fit perfectly
0,Works great. I've dropped my phone and its always kept the screen from breaking. I have had one on my old phone and after dropping my new one decided it was time to get a screen protector.
0,This was a gift and the recipient seem to like it
0,There is a  lot of good features from this car charger. Built- inLightning cable and micro-usb combo: This is super awesome because some of my friends and family have android phones, some of them have iphones so this is great because you're not constantly changing the cable which is such a tedious task. Easy to use and the lightning cable is mfi-certified which means that it is definitely a quality product! I also like how the cable is connected so you don't have to worry about forgetting your cable or leaving it at home. Coiled design: this makes the cable not gigantically long so that you don't have a long cable that is constantly getting in your way. Two extra outputs: So if you have a full car or if you need other cables to add, this is a great addition so you're not limited in options. The total maximum output is 5A which is definitely a pretty good output! LED indicator light: pretty good light which shows power status and adds an aesthetic appeal	Downside to this car charger is...The length: it is pretty good length for a car, however, it doesn't reach all the way to the back. Some people may say that it's a pro while some say its a con, but just wanted to point it out that if your friend is sitting all the way in the left or right backseat, they will probably have to put the phone in the middle of the car for the cable to be at an appropriate length. However, it's the perfect length for front seat use. If your friends/family have their long cable to connect with the car charger then its fine.	I received this product in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.
0,This case comes with decent shock protection, a roomy charging port hole and is a crystal clear case with a nice painted-effect wave on the back, everyone who sees it wants one. my wife loves this case very much.
0,Nice
0,Installed today took seconds !!! Awesome hands free - Thanks
0,Love it, fits, protects. What more can I expect. I have gotten comments on it. I love the worn flag.  GOod for the time of year.
0,Simple and durable
0,I have own several Platinum cases and love them all
0,I have to get those again.  They are comfortable and loud and clear.
0,Pretty good case
0,Great smartphone potector. But....	Much, much cheaper on Aliexpress.
0,These are exactly the same as rugged radios at a fraction of the cost.
0,I got my n95  8gb  today and very happy about it. It has 3g so don't worry about it and everything on it works perfect and with internet calling option i am making free overseas calls....what can i ask for more?	Perfect phone and deserves 5 stars maybe more than that...
0,Great quality. I like these better than the LG or some of the cheaper versions I have tried. So far I find these comfortable and easy to use. The call quality seems to be perfect as I've had no complaints as I did with the other bluetooth headphones I've tried.
0,The only thing it needs is some of that soft material on the hoslter that wisk particals away. The case is heavy duty like advertised. Good product
0,Case is made of good quality. I recommend this product.
0,I really like this case. I was worried it would fall apart but is still in perfect condition. Just beautiful. I recommend it.
0,I love it!! it is nice and has no sticky smell when arriving. I always like the leather wallet combined iphone case since I can bring both my phone and cards. it is cheap for counting one wallet and one phone case at the same time. I brought this product with a discount coupon in order to exchange my real review.
0,A screen protector is pretty much a screen protector. I have tried buying the more expensive ones and there is no real difference as far as I can tell. These are a great deal at fifty cents per, and the shipping was much faster than I expected. I thought they would come air mail from China and take several weeks, but actually they shipped out in an envelope via USPS and arrived in just a few days.
0,These are the best cases EVER! Pricey at first but those gel, hard plastic, and others wear out /break and these cases LAST ! Bulky but after you drop your iphone/ipad/ipod and it's fine and case is as well you will be happy for the bouncy bulkiness!
0,Perfect case, fits beautifully. Love the clear back. Best of all, great protection.
0,I bought this Defender series tough protective case for my family because I heard a lot of good things about this case. It just arrived today on time and Thanks Amazon.
0,Fit great but my wife does not need the magnetic clasp.  She only carries one CC and her DL so the case stays closed without the use of the clasp.
0,Took a minute to figure out how to put it on, but it works great.
0,I was looking for a budget smartphone when I came across this model. It is compact, easy-read screen, and practically everything that one would want in a budget smartphone. The weakness is that it has no front camera, the back camera is on 2MPixels, and that there is no 3G. However, I was not looking for any of these features and theefoe I am reasonably satisfied with this model.		The WIFI works well and that is all what I needed at home. It is too small for me, anyway, for 3G use so I am not disappointed.		The battery lasts about 12 to 14 hours for normal use, but much less if you use WiFi.		As a whole, for the price that one pays, this is ok!!
0,Love that this is clear so I can protect my iphone without hiding it under some bulky, large case! Get this cover and stay protected!
0,So much easier to use my iPhone as a video recorder.  Combine this with a GP1-A1EN Gorillapod and you are set for anything!
0,Had a little problem with one corner sticking up by the dual cameras. Most of the screen protectors out the for the LG V10 have that one little piece that is like your thumb on your hand. I contacted Supershieldz and ask them if there had been any complaints about this laying flat, the said no. They asked me to send them a picture so they could see what I was talking about. They said they really couldn't tell what I was talking about but they replace it with a new one anyway and they did, very fast.
0,Protected my screen from breaking after dropping it.
0,I love this case. It is slim yet protective. I have dropped my phone many many times on different flooring (concrete to carpet) and you wouldn't be able to tell by looking at this case. This is also the thinnest case I have for this phone but I feel like it is the most protective. When the phone becomes hot, you can't feel it through the case (I would feel it through the fingerprint scanner). The only downside is I don't think I can ever get this off my phone. If you put it on, it's on for good. I don't mind since the case is really cute.
0,I ordered this screen protector for my Daughter's Iphone 6 after her Zagg screen protector that I paid $40 for failed, for no reason. I was not about to pay a shipping fee to replace it, so I ordered this one on a promotional offer to test it out and see how it fit and performed on her phone.	The price is very cheap, do not let that deter you. Quality is excellent.	Very easy to apply, fitment was perfect.	So thankful to Mxx accessories for a high quality glass screen protector.	Satisfaction guaranteed!
0,Chargers worked fine for me and the family.
0,Works well and stylish.
0,came on good. flawless.
0,Dear daughter #2 lost her charger again. She has a Galaxy Tab something or other tablet that she uses for both school and work and constantly needs to charge it. It is getting old, and the battery does not last all day so she charges it in her car between school and her job. Shes gone through several chargers already due to misplacing them, theft, and a couple that just stopped working.	I like this charger because not only does it charge her tablet efficiently and very quickly, it  has an extra USB port so she can also charge her iPhone simultaneously. Not many chargers allow you to charge different brand or styles of phones at the same time! Apple products need a lightning port charger, and Samsung uses micro-USB. This charger handles them both!!	She does not like the coiled cord on this charger, however, so it is not her absolute favorite. I guess I didn't think of that when I ordered it, and I won't make that mistake again. Coiled cords are too short! And they can damage your charging port if you put stress on them by pulling on the cord when it is plugged in. Weve had to repair more than one device due to this happening. Ooops! If it wasn't for having a coiled cord, this would earn all FIVE STARS. As far as coiled cords go, this is not the tightest or shortest one weve had, but it is still shorter than a straight cord I believe.	I purchased this Galaxy Micro USB Car Charger, Vehicle Car Charger For Samsung Galaxy S7 S6 S5 S3 S4 Edge Note With Dual USB Port by Sunshine M&B  at no cost to myself in exchange for my unbiased opinion and review. I have no affiliation to this company and receive no financial gain. I only leave positive reviews for items that meet or exceed my expectations.
0,This is perfect for me. My wife and I love them.
0,Otterbox defender is a great durable case, and was a great price on amazon. I am very protectI've over my electronics so this case makes everyday life more manageable. You can go about your day not having to worry about your phone
0,Bought this for my S5. It worked great for about 6 months and I had to replace it.
0,Great case.  Not real durable but nice fit and feel.
0,Love it works great
0,very good
0,Perfect fit.  Good product.
0,This phone is really greart
0,I bought several because it was soooo cheap. I now have one in my car, at work and at home and they have all worked well.
0,They seem durable and work well. Cords are thick so it's a little tricky if my phone is in close quarters
0,love them....
0,I would never buy this again. This protector always seemed to have scratches on it!
0,I thought this was for a 7 inch tablet. I use this when I am not using my tablet and when I am charging it
0,I've bought several of these. This is the higher quality one of what's out there.
0,I love this case!! It fit the phone perfectly with great grip.  It's very durable and protect the phone well when you drop it.  Cheap price for great quality!!!
0,Nice!
0,Excellent, and totally what i was expecting. Make sure to do your cycling on the battery 5 times from 100% down to 5 or below. With full days of consistent use on apps and internet, my 1st cycle went well into the 3rd day, 2nd cycle 2 full days, 3rd 3 days, 4th 2.5 days, and 5th, 2 full days. After that, as i am writing this, i woke up with a full charge, and after using it consistently for 12 hours, it is still at 68%. I could go to sleep, and easily go the whole day tomorrow before needing to recharge it, but i'm going to anyway. I'm going to look into charging half-full a little more to see if it is good, bad, or doesn't really matter. As a side note, i use full brightness on my screen with only the regular "power-saving" mode, and my screen stays awake for a minute before fading while i have something open. I have 2 critiques that i hope Zerolemon pays attention to: 1.) The holster should have been designed better....as default vertical, rather than horizontal, with a spring-type clip rather than the clip that it has. You have to actually pay some attention to getting the phone secured in there in the vertical position, and making sure it is firmly locked. The belt-clip itself is very sturdy, and the rotational gauge is strong, not loose (bonus points!) 2.) The kickstand should have been integrated into the back of the phone case. This way, it could be used even if the holster wasn't (most days, i don't use mine). The case on this thing is great!! It is really rugged and sturdy, with a protective lip around the screen, and feels solid in the hand....it makes it very hard to drop. In regard to the 2 critiques, i ask Zerolemon to look at the Seidio case and holster for the EXTENDED BATTERY Galaxy Note 3. That thing was the bomb. I am totally happy with the Zerolemon, though, and recommend it to anyone who's looking for a long life battery with a great protective case and holster. The price is excellent for this (i paid $59.99).
0,Dandy Case's are some of my favorite cases. I would recommend them to anyone.
0,Husband loves these products!
0,Love the color and it fits great, this case can quickly and I am satisfied will be buying more
0,Does just what it should. Locks onto belt nice and protects my phone
0,well made, fit just right, not too loose not too tight incase you need to remove to access SIM card or battery.
0,Going with note 4 but this device rocks it
0,Great product, shipped fast. It's a snug fit for my phone even with the case on it.
0,This unit has many good points		 Charges very good and fast		 The short body minimizesintrusion into the cab and less likely to hit or be it it with something		 This unit , unlike the NT81T, has a very solid contact with the 12 receptacle (feels like 2 or 3 times more resistance)		 The enclosed cords engage solidly and can easily be removed without disengaging the charger		On the downside:		 The orange glow border is only visible in the night (unlike the blue that is visible all the time)		 The enclosed cord is about 6-10 inches short if you want to use your phone while charging		Overall will give this 4.5 out of 5
0,Very nice
0,love this little thing..
0,This is the 2nd time I have purchased these.  All the other glass screens are too big.  While the other glass screens cover the Nexus 6 screen more completely, they all end up with air pockets under the screen because the Nexus 6 has a very curves screen.  So bigger is not better in this case.  These screens are significantly smaller than the Nexus 6 screen, but does cover the display area COMPLETELY.  Don't listen to the complaints that these are too small.  They are made this way for a reason.  Highly recommended.
0,I have been hearing so many good things about these kind of selfie sticks so I decided to try one of my own and I'm so glad I did! I love it! The selfie stick holds my iPhone tightly and snug so I have no worries of my phone falling out. I like that it is small enough to fit in my purse and easily portable so that I can carry it with me wherever I go. It is very fun to use and works great. Plus, it is very durable and in perfect condition. I highly recommend! I did receive this at a discount for my fair and honest review but, the stick is great and always ready to use. I keep this one in the car just in case i'm out with friends and need it for the fun of it.
0,Very good item, the charge capacity is very good.
0,On time,as described, and great price. Is better then the ones from Verizon that are 10x the price. Definitely recommend.
0,This thing is a beast! I love it. Quick review...		Pros: Large capacity, can charge my phone at least 4-5 times on one full charge, maybe more (I haven't actually been in a situation where I had to completely drain it). Indicator lights are helpful.		Cons: It's heavy and bulky. Takes a bit longer to charge than others of the same/similar mAh rating...		Overall: Good buy if you don't mind the size and weight.
0,Great!
0,Just got this case in from Amazon and going to cautiously give it 4 stars. I might go higher after I spend time with it. I have been thru MANY iphone cases trying to find the best one. I think I was a little obsessive about it.		Avoid all the silicone / rubber cases, they look nice, they grip well but they ALL stretch some over time. What starts our as a snug glove - tight fit loosens a lot until it squishes around the unit like its made 1 size too big. The hard shell case is the way to go. they don't stretch. Try to get one with a "grippy" surface as opposed to the slick ones that make the iphone prone to flying out of your hand.		The Pros - fits perfectly, bottom locks into the top and you have one seamless fit. It says you can take the bottom off to dock but I bet this will fit in my Sony clock radio just fine as ia. Nice grip-able leather surface & feels good to hold. The sides are just shallow enough to not get in the way of your fingers as you type but enough that if you turn it face down the glass won't be touching the surface. The cut outs for the top and side buttons is well done, your fingers find the buttons easily without looking.		The Cons: Just the weird poly-carbonate shield it ships with. It might turn out to be awesome but I am used to the very clingy type of stick-on shield. This one is much thicker and you can take it off and re-apply. There's a lot of glare caused by this new shield and it seems to attract prints more. I guess the upside is I can take it off and wash it and put it back on. I will say tho, while looking at the iphone straight on I can't really see any difference. Its mainly when looking at it from the side or when its off. Anyways, I can easily buy some regular press on screens if I don't like this one but I like the idea of thicker and re-useable.		Its also a little tricky when you slide the bottom on to make sure the screen cover and such are all in the right grooves, its that reason I'd prefer to not take the bottom off any more than I have to.		So, wow - maybe my search for the perfect case is over. Now to ebay all those other cases.
0,very happy, good product and quality, works fine does the job. I use the in the car to connect my mobile device to the stereo. the short cable keeps the car tide.
0,Nice
0,Great product and great service would recomend to any one to purchase .
0,Hard and easy to install. The seller (KingMas) packaged my item pretty well. It was in a hard styrofoam case which was pretty awesome.
0,This works great Thanks
0,I like it very much. THere is no problem with the velcro tape. However, it is slightly too tight, and the design could have been slightly better... But for this price I cant complain too much
0,Is just perfect. i love it.
0,It works very well with my iPhone 6 Plus. It is easy to put in and easy to take it off, but not easy to fall out. Material feels nice and sturdy. I have nothing to complain but enjoy it.
0,Great product
0,I've used a number of different bluetooth headsets over the years, and I've had good luck with most of them.  I had a Platronics Voyager HD and it was fine, but for some reason, after about a year or so, it started getting alot of static so I pitched it.  I moved on to the Jabra Motion, which was also fine, until my dog chewed it up.  As a replacement for the Motion, I decided to with a an ear bud style headset versus an over the ear headset, and the ERA seemed like the best choice at the moment.		So far, I'm liking it.  Inbound and outbound sound quality seems very good.  Noise cancellation seems very good.  Fit seems good and secure (I was a little worried moving from the over the ear style). Voice dialing works fine (although I have found it is easier just  to use Siri on my Iphone to make calls, but that's a personal preference).  Charging case works well.  Pairing to my Iphone was quick and easy.		The small size is a blessing and a curse.  It's very light and unobtrusive, but it's small size also limits the battery life.  If you are a person that talks on your bluetooth headset  all day, this may not be the one for you.  There are other quality headsets that offer longer battery life. but they are bigger.  For me, its not an issue,.  I can put it back in the case between calls, and it stays charged. Small size also means a greater chance of losing it.  I am actually a little worried about that, but I'll just have to make sure I keep up with it.		For those having problems with charging, or connecting, or sound quality, I can only say that I have not experienced any of those issues.  If you get a unit that has problems right out of the chute it is probably a defective unit.  Just return it and get another one.		Overall, this is a quality headset.
0,I loooove this case!! I get so many compliments from this case. It is large, however I have a large phone, NOTE 3, so it looks even bigger. I sanitize it down often and it does not fade the color. I also leave it in the car often and it is very hot where we live, and the material has not warped.  It is so attractive to kids that I can even get the babies to look at the mini when taking pictures and I get a good picture every time! no more funny faces to get the kids attention. Very well made. I would recommend this products.

0,Basic cables, well made.
0,good looking, easy to put on
0,Makes the selfie even more easier and fun. Easy to connect and with smart phone. love the color green.
0,Works well but will disconnect within 10 feet of phone sometimes..  This is my second unit. the first also had to be returned..
0,I got this case for my wife because she has a 5S and may upgrade to the new SE, and it's nice that this is compatible with both. I'll break up my review into sections to make it easier to read:		BUILD QUALITY:	The construction of the case feels sturdy and the unit has some weight to it. It's essentially doubling your battery life and providing some protection, so this is why it's heavier. It has a rubberized texture which helps with the grip.		INSTALLATION:	It was a little hard to get the front piece off. This could be a good thing because it means it's not going to come off during use. Once the phone was in and the front piece clipped down over it, I noticed that there was a small gap between the back of the phone and the case. The phone didn't wiggle around at all but the gap could catch lint and particles; this gap may be to keep the phone from rubbing, but a soft material inside the case would fix that.		PERFORMANCE:	Once you push and hold the power button on the back for a few seconds, the case turns on and begins charging your phone. I was able to get one full charge and a little more which was about what I was expecting. The only downside to the cases besides the added weight and thickness is that once your phone is charged and the case is depleted, you're left with dead weight on your phone.		SUMMARY:	Overall, this is a nice case that has a good solid feel to it and adds one full charge to your phone. You won't get the full listed mAh capacity which is normal for battery backups. Aside from the gap on the back, it fit perfectly and was snug.		Disclosure: I got this case for free to evaluate. I wasn't compensated by Amazon nor this seller, so these are my own unbiased opinions. Hopefully the review helped you!
0,Works and looks great. A steal for the price! Comes with stylus and screen protector also. Very satisfied, will order again when I purchase another tab.
0,PERFECT
0,UPDATE: I switched carriers and ported my number so I had to go thru that weird dual SIM period where my new & old phone both worked.  The adapters did not fit the micro-cutout at all so I put the AT&T SIM card back into the cutout; it was not perfectly even so was a bit of struggle to push back into my Nokia N8.  When Tmobile finished porting my number (so I only needed to use my Nokia N9) I tried to get the SIM back out of the N8 but it would not pop back out.  The included tweezers easily pulled it right out.  So in sum, the adapters do not work but the tweezers were a life saver (the opposite of what I thought would happen).		Was a little worried about cutting my own SIM card especially based upon the mixed reviews.  Chose this one as it does micro & nano size (thinking ahead) and because it cost a little more as the some of the other models looked cheap and this was not a task I wanted to go wrong.  The cutter itself actually looks of a decent quality and not like a budget item & cutting my SIM card was very easy.  The preview window makes it almost impossible to do wrong (cutting the metal part) altho it does come very close to the edge of the metal part so it was a bit hard to tell if it was lined up correctly.		Did not even have to use the tweezers or the sander to get it to fit into my new Nokia N9.  Have not had to use the adapters either so no comment on those ... yet.  Altho a tip I have read was to keep the cut-off part of your original SIM card & just use that as the adapter if you have to put it in another phone.		Only real complaint is that this is more of a puncher, than a cutter.  The way it punches the micro sized card out leaves the edges a bit jagged and it looked like it may have damaged the metal part but it works fine.
0,The kick stand was nice it really works
0,Excellent Product
0,great Case, very protective on phone
0,Perfect!
0,Looks great with my gold phone. I've received numerous complements on it.
0,Nice case, not as bulky as others, yet seems like very good protection. It's nice looking, too.		This case was purchased for an employee; I do not use it myself. He drives our delivery truck and so far this case has offered very good protection. He drives a forklift to load and unload rebar trucks, he also helps to fabricate rebar. His phone needs a case that offers extreme protection. So far the Zizo Bolt Cover is doing exactly what it was intended to do.
0,great
0,This is my favorite case, which I could get it in other colors.  Great case!
0,Good
0,Charge my devices very well.	Quite big and heavy.	Like the attached cables design very much so that extra usb cables are not needed.  It is actually this attached cables design that got me to pick this power bank over other models.
0,I love this case and would recommend it to someone that needed a case for phone, money and cards. It was lovelier than the picture  shows.
0,Very nice and seems to be well made.  I haven't dropped it yet but it seems like it will be protected if I do.  I love the color!  Very pretty!  I've paid more for lesser cases before.
0,It great, has some seal and excellent product.		purchased it for a friend who had the devices.
0,Worked good on the phone
0,I currently have other battery chargers too,but this one scores better is multiple areas.		1) Charges my Iphone 5 - 5 times in single full charge.	2) Charges my Ipad Air - 80 % with continuous usage.	3) Charges my Iphone 4s,Ipod - at-least 5 times. didn't keep a precise count.	4) Use it with my Orion 9024 telescope for the motor axis mount.- Works perfectly.	5) Was definitely very useful over my long summer trips.	6) Nice Matt texture.		Size - Its exactly the height of Iphone 5,little bit more wider and fatter.but It definitely provides that with power.
0,Love it. Much easier to apply than some of the other ones I've tried in the past on other phones.
0,Works just as expected.  Hard to tell the difference from the original charger, except this charger is actually long enough to be more accommodating for placement.  I like it better than the stock unit it replaces.
0,This case matches my phone perfectly and came with a free stylus and screen protector!  What a deal.  It fits perfectly and I have dropped my phone in it and both the phone and case are perfect.  Highly recommended.
0,Bought this as a replacement for our original one that our dog kinda killed and it is exactly the same.
0,I love this case.  Its sleek and elegant worth the money.
0,I ORDERED 2 BY MISTAKE SO I WILL BE GIVING ONE AWAY AS A GIFT. BUT I DO LIKE THE WAY IT FITS MY PHONE
0,Excellent. I tried different devices in different conditions. In dull so cloudy I couldn't actually see the sun I was getting 300mah into my tablet which would equate to slowly charging whilst using. Once sun came out the power increased and was matching mains power charging times.		My phone was a little more demanding, it would not charge in dull cloud but would in stronger sunshine.		Tried two different USB batteries and they were charging fine in any condition including indoors.		I intend when not dependent on this solar panel to learn the best combinations of devices to conditions to get the best use. I suspect it will end up directly powering gadgets (phone etc) in stronger light and a USB battery in all other situations.		I intend to get a USB power meter to learn the better combinations.		Attached are photos showing charging a tablet and what the tablet and also a phone recorded whilst charging.
0,This is a very light weight case that adds almost no weight or bulk to your phone. It also gives it a little more grip so its easier to hold onto your phone. I highly recommend this case if you're looking for something simple.	I received this item at a discount in return for a honest review.
0,Great Phone , i bought it for my father and he loved it , nice bright screen , and a very nice camera . doesn't show any lag .
0,Good product.  Works fantastic!

0,Just what I needed. It definitely saves the day
0,Works great! About 1000 Ma charging with several items plugged in.
0,I received the product for free for reviewing product. this works great with galaxy 7 edge. i don't think its fast charging but bnbut it still great. works without any add on receiver or mod. great product. thank you!
1,This is a very low quality product, it's like buying from some cheap Chinese website. Check out the pictures, i followed all the instructions i literally had the video in front of me as i was applying it. Contacted the seller asking for return product which I'm cool with it BUT asking me to pay for the return shipping, I'm like hell naa. I not wasting more money on this piece of crap. So I'm stuck with it now
1,This was amazing charge rifle than an hour an hour and 10 minutes but after a few months it kept taking longer and longer and longer it takes longer than even the slowest charger so it's at the back of my junk drawer
1,didn't work
1,Mine didn't arrive with the metal plates needed :-(
1,The order arrived on time and the packaging was professional and neat. However when I applied it to my screen it barely covers the actual screen. There is a huge gap on all sides and some of the black screen is visible outside of the glass protector. The iPhone 6 has curved edges but I would have expected it to cover more than just the screen. I have ordered glass protectors for all my iPhone's in the past but this one has been the worst fit. I gave it 2 stars because it was easy to apply.
1,Often would not charge if in case.
1,not sticking at all, went thru all 3 and none stay on at all
1,Their ok but cheaply made honestly
1,Falling apart after a few months. The cool design peels off :(
1,These are great Bluetooth devices - but steer clear of the refurbs. I bought one and the flip part broke upon first use. I bought another, same result. I bought a new one and have no trouble with it at all
1,Poorly Designed. Does not securely hold iPhone 5. Holder is a 'clamp' which is spring loaded. Phone slips and / or bumps out of clamp. The angle-adjustment pivot ball between base and clamp-head does not adequately tighten to lock into place at a given position. Very sorry I purchased this and now I have  to find a reliable clamp. badly spent money. Do not buy this one.
1,I wasn't like my case miss diamon
1,need a better system for holding the phone or tablet
1,Does not fit! Seller never responds.
1,It protects the watch just well, the issue is that I need to take it out many times and manually clean it since it easily gets wet between the case and the watch, and if so the touch screen does not work any more.	Tried to use it during running sessions but same issue, it gets wet inside and touch screen stops working.	Good concept but not practical to use.
1,Stylus was not the red Hello Kitty as shown.  It was an ugly green monster that i would never hang from my phone.  I am frustrated because it is not worth the cost of sending back.
1,peeled off after about a week.  total waste of money
1,At first sight, I noticed the paint was either falling off or withering away so theres problem one. As if someone had been rubbing at it purposely to fade the color. But not terrible. It is not at all properly designed to hold the device snugg without any gaps, because there ARE gaps on the left of the device which makes the volume buttons hard to reach. No, ALL the buttons are hard to reach because of the poor workmanship. Wasnt worth the money.
1,Cannot charge the case. Starts working fine then the charging port stops working.
1,It's a nice case but hard to fit around the buttons. Keeps pushing the buttons if it's not on right
1,Quick release has lost the spring tension within couple of weeks usage. It does not even expand anymore. You have to manually force it to expand.
1,I'll be returning it for a couple of reasons.  One, right out of the package, I was disappointed.  The color is blah, not what I expected. I can barely differentiate it from an old beat-up, black case I had on another phone for years. I did at least try it out on my phone, thinking I could get over the blah-ness of it.  Unfortunately, it doesn't fit my Galaxy J7.  It's too snug by maybe a millimeter, because not all 4 corners will go on at the same time, I can only get 3 of them on.  The 4th one, whichever corner it ends up being, won't quite slip over the edge.  I'm afraid it wouldn't truly protect my phone in a drop.
1,Major deal breaker.  This phone has amazing features and is ready for the future, except for this one unacceptable downgrade
1,poor
1,Overheating like crazy had to discard. It was a disappointment and embarrassment to the person who I helped select and purchase it.
1,This was a nightmare. The shipping was fast, it got here before the estimated arrival time, and was packed well but a bent connector and faulty screen had me taking it apart many times and as the result I broke the ribbon cable to the home button. I had to have a replacement sent because the digitizer was faulty. I also had to order a new home button and have it rushed witch cost me. The screen had lines, boxes across the screen, and either wouldn't respond or would switch screens on its own. The frame around the speaker assembly also had a flaw and would not allow for it to be put back together properly. The cover would not latch and the long screw would not go back in. Even the replacement assembly had the same bent connector that caused issues. After a few careful adjustments and reseating the connectors a few time I finally got it to work. Be very careful and turn it on and test it BEFORE putting it completely back together. This was a nightmare. The instructions were slightly vague at times and I suggest watching a couple YouTube videos of the repair before doing it yourself. It did come with a decent set of tools that held up well during the several times I had to take it apart and put it back together. I feel I'm an expert at taking the iPhone apart and putting it back together now. I can do the repair in less than 15 minutes if the parts are not faulty. I fixed copiers for 12+ years so I am very experienced repairing electronics. If the parts were not faulty this would have been a smooth job with the tools provided. After this fiasco I am asking for a partial, hopeful 50%, refund. I hope the manufacturer will make this right. I would not recommend this product after having the same bent connector issue with both parts sent.
1,Failed in less than 6 months. They won't replace. Look elsewhere.
1,I had to reinforce everything. Not good stitching quality. The plastic does allow for the screen to be operated by touch, which is good.
1,Cheap phone, OK for a first phone . Wouldn't recommend this for someone who already owns a phone.
1,The only good phone HTC made was the ONE. and the T-Mobile g1 lol.	This phone so slow, lag, KitKat, front facing speakers not even as loud as my lg Leon I got for $40, not even loud as iPhone speakers so quiet tons of bloatware, very little storage space, user interface clunky crowded slow useless and boring. Even installing launcher makes phone the still BAD BAD BAD!
1,I ordered two of the same case one black one gold. Both for the galaxy s6. The gold fit like a glove. The black is for a completely different phone despite the product description. The case did not line up with the phone's buttons and covered half my camera.
1,It simply doesn't work! Don't buy this!!		<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Samsung-Travel-Charger-for-Galaxy-Note-4-Edge-S6-Non-Retail-Packaging-White/dp/B00WXIIQ1C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Samsung Travel Charger for Galaxy Note 4/Edge S6 - Non-Retail Packaging - White</a>
1,PROS:	* Works for very thin cases with nothing inside	* Works on naked phones	* Great way to keep your phone cool if it's doing GPS, in the sun, and charging.	* Good construction and finish - looks nice if even noticed.		CONS:	* Not effective for thick cases	* Strong magnets cannot be used with wallet cases	* Reduces life of AC vent louvers.		DETAILS:	The car-side part of this is four N38 disc magnets, 1/4" diameter, and 1/8" thick.  They're mounted inside of a silicone rubber sheath that's attached to a hard plastic backing.		Out of the backing stick rubberized forks.  One direction is wider slots, and 90 degrees rotated are narrower slots.  This allows it to be mounted to different vent louvers.		The phone side is a 1mm steel plate, with black enamel coating.  Included are two 4cm, self adhesive discs, and two 45.2x65.5mm rounded-corner rectangles with a 3mm hole and no adhesive.		I tested this on a variety of phone cases, but the biggest limitation is the thickness of the steel plates.  Thinner plates mean less metal being crossed by the flux lines.		For thin cases, with nothing inside, such as a 1.5mm TPU (Incipio) or ABS (AdventureTime Beemo), this works well.  The rectangle is better.  Major bumps will shift the phone, but normal driving is good for quite a while without adjustment.		If you put a card of any sort in there, doubling the thickness, then you lose a good portion of the strength.  Normal road bounces cause the phone to twist.		If you have something thicker, like a quad-lock case, while the magnets would fit in the hole, the rubber keeper does not.  You can stick this to the phone, but the phone will not hang off of this in a car.		Also, if you have a wallet case, it would be both too thick for this, and also would kill any magnetic cards (ccard, driver's license) that you stored in the wallet.		Finally, if the plate slides in your case, such as after a bump, drop, or slightly loose case, then the mount will be off center.  If it's off center, then the imbalance will cause the phone to twist.  The same can/will happen if you have cables plugged in that hang from the phone.  Not as big of a deal in portrait mode as landscape mode.		As to the vent side, it's fine, but know that if you put it in the middle of the vent, it will massively increase the stress on the plastic louvres.  They were not designed to carry the weight of a phone.  They will eventually crack, especially if your car is a little older.		This can be mostly limited by keeping the unit installed off to the side, and it grips well enough to stay put.		The product reviewed was provided as a free sample.
1,Didn't fit my 5c very well and constantly lowered volume down on its own. Absolutely great space for cards though held three comfortably
1,Doesn't work
1,Too be for my Samsung Galaxy 4. Jostle around when I am running. So not helpful.
1,Broke apart after one week of using. Disappointed will return
1,One of them already quit working . The other 3 still work.  Not sure what happened . No misuse.
1,Ordered two one for me and one for my wife, seemed to be pretty deceint quailty but felt a little thin. Both were cracked in the bottom corner within an hour. my wifes broke on install not sure how and mine broke when I tried to reposition in to fit the phone better
1,I gave this case to my boyfriend for Christmas. Now, just over 4 months later, the black rubbery part on the front is separating from the orange part. It's not bad but I bought it to replace his old Defender case which was completely trashed and falling apart, and now I see the same separation of materials happening to this one already. He works construction, and hunts regularly and treats it like a guy with that lifestyle would - so I'm disappointed to see it starting to fall apart already.  Also there is a fair amount of dust under the screen protector from his job. Next time I'll get him the Griffin Survivor which comes in mossy oak camo.	http://www.amazon.com/Survivor-Mossy-Oak%C3%A5%C2%A8-iPhone-obsession/dp/B00CAYF202/ref=pd_sim_sbs_cps_4
1,Had a similar case that lasted for about 5 months... That's all, but it could hold up to 6 cards plus visible license. Worked great, but obviously 5 months until the stitching came out wasn't. Read the reviews for this, thought it was pretty similar. The quality is poor, made out of cheap vinyl. Not expecting it to last for more than a few weeks!
1,I liked this case,  but it broke in half in the first week. It seems to be cheaply made. I love the design,  but quality is seriously lacking.
1,Glue on cushion that kept phone in place wore out on 3rd use
1,It seems like a good device, but there is not real way to tell without buying it and a charger.  It installs with no issues or problems, and even fit under the thin Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime cover with only a little bulge.  Unfortunately, it would not charge the phone when the phone was on, and when I turned off the phone and left it on the charger with all indications it was charging, in 8 hours, it went from 42% to 52%.		That makes this unit, either defective, or poorly designed.		I even installed it on the outside of the phone so it could have direct contact with the charging station, but it did not change the charge rate.
1,Flimsy with a worthless screen protector
1,Within one week the white soft casing is stretchy,	and it is not going to last.  Would reccomend	something more structured.
1,Looks nice but Broke within a few weeks...
1,The short one stopped working and was really messing with my phone. It was not only not charging, it made the phone go negative charging. not useful
1,Very nice phone holder. Works great and it looks good.it lasted for a week or would n't buy
1,Didn't work great for my phone. When inside the kickstand case, the phone volume was always on because a corner of the case was always pushing the button in...
1,I thought the idea of rubber was great until I received the item. It's so cheap, loose, and stretched so that it didn't fit the phone properly. Very disappointed with this product. Never would by again.
1,I should have known bedtter.  I've tried different brands of generic, cheap cords and could've bought several Apple cords by now.  These cheap ones aren't supported by the phone or tablet and they come apart.
1,Had to throw it in the dust bin....headache to apply....not happy with the product
1,This battery pack worked great for 3 months until it stopped functioning altogether. No lights no charge no nothing.
1,Returned it. Cheap plastic. Kept falling out of my power port in my car. Does do a great job charging. Would have worked better in a car where the ports are pointed up instead of sideways.
1,Poor product. Battery never charged full. After a few days started to reduce carge duration. After a month couldn't be charged.	Cover flimsy and poor plastic.
1,Test your 2" adapter cables before you pack them for a trip!  I found out (the hard way) that my micro USB adapter didn't work.  The extension cable and mini usb work fine; just the micro USB doesn't work, even if I use it directly (with no extension cable).		Note: I didn't try the iPod adapter.
1,Got it today.  I received a straight piece of rectangular glass! With no cut outs or round edges to fit a Samsung Galaxy S3! Rip off!
1,Terrible!!! Broke the day after arriving. I didn't even get a full days use. Not worth returning.	Shipping time was long.
1,They went on well , minimal bubbling.  But screen leaves bed finger prints.
1,This extended battery worked very well for about three months.  Then it started to lose its charge at about the same rate as the original battery that came with my Droid Charge.  In other words, it went from 100% to 0% in about 4 hours.  But the really bad part came this morning when I picked it up to unplug the phone from the charger.  My fingers were burned!  The battery was probably 200 degrees.  By the time I did my 15 drive to work, the battery had cooled down to the point where it could be touched.  A check of the phone functions showed that it still works, at least for now.  So it's back to the original battery and hope that no damage has been done to the phone.
1,trash
1,Looks nothing like the picture, and isn't the greatest quality. The color trim is hardly visible.
1,I just don't understand why microsoft so soft with those boring apps... its bad guys.. apps gave this a bad rating
1,It looks pretty nice when you first put it on and it seems like it will add the protection I expect, but once you put it in your pocket expect anything in there to stick to it. I had it in my pocket one day and now I have little white flakes all over the case that do not come off easily. I will be getting another case shortly. Don't buy it.
1,Dark blue jeans will dye the phones case , cheaply made.
1,After charging overnight, I paired this with my HTC 8525 PDA phone from Cingular (AT&T).  Unless I am willing to hold the phone next to the headset, the Bluetooth connection gets very noisy and will likely drop/disconnect.  This not only looks ridiculous, but doesn't qualify as hands-free.		It doesn't matter how good the sound quality of the headset might be if the device can't maintain a wireless connection.		To be fair, I paired the headset with other (different) phones and my Apple MacBook Pro.  (All of the tested phones and my laptop have worked with other headsets from Jawbone (I & II), Blue Ant (Z9 & Z9i), Motorola (H12), and Plantronics (925)--most at distances of 20 feet or more.)		I may try another unit in a few months, hoping that I just received a defective one or that a software upgrade may improve the radio range.
1,False advertising. Its the same battery you already have in your G3 right now, except if you buy this your phone will be bigger and won't fit in any cases. Your call.
1,Broke right away. Do not buy! Used for a Samsung Galaxy -- a normal size cell
1,After following online instructions from youtube implicitly I reassembled my phone to find that it absolutely does not respond to touch. Two of the included tools shattered in my hand they were so cheap. Tried reattaching ribbons, and everything  could think of and find on internet for 3 hours.	Gave up and just ordered a legit screen, lcd combo from a different seller. Avoid this product.
1,Works intermittently, I'm not impressed.  Doesn't seem to stay connected very well.
1,garbage. doesnt actually protect your phone. Feels like its too small and doesnt actually fit. On top of this, it's just ugly
1,They are breaking too soon!!
1,This phone case is not a rose gold color. The photo is very misleading & deceiving.
1,Poor quality.,  lasted 2 months
1,I was in love the idea of what I could do with this device. It worked very well with Note 2 and initially my Note 3 until just recently (yesterday). I now can't stay connected to the device for more than 5 minutes at a time so it is now completely useless and I bought this last year at $75 and the price has dropped since. My advice is to you is to proceed with caution. Samsung may need to update the software again. I'm going to purchase the wireless adapter for my Samsung Smart TV and just use my MHL to HDMI dongle for the LG screen we use in the family room. I hope Samsung reads these reviews,  because this device has a good bit of bad reviews.
1,Wrong item, but functional!
1,it was pink and I paid for red
1,the rubber casing has bad design; it actually does not fit iphone 5s properly. please do not waste your money on this. thanks
1,Doesn't stick ! Reflects well but what's the point if it doesn't stay?!
1,Got a clear version with Champagne Gold trim for my son.  Despite all the positive reviews I found this case to be very flimsy and cheaply made.  The gold trim is nothing like the picture, it's ugly beige brown.  The case comes with thin protective layers on both sides, difficult to peel off, and as I was trying to peel them off I scratched the clear case with my finger nail.  So much for scratch resistant.  I have EasyAcc TPU case for Galaxy s6 for half the price and absolutely love it.  Wish they made a case for iPhone 5s.
1,It's cheap, it doesn't have a snug fit on the phone. Cracked within a week of having it, and I never even dropped it. Do yourself a favor, spend a few extra bucks and get a speck case.
1,I like to keep my reviews short and simple.  Don't buy this item for your BBry 8900. Look elsewhere for a quality product.
1,Wont even charge my iPad 3 in the 2.1 port and in the 2.4 port in 5 hours it moved just 4%. Maybe I recieved a bad one because I have a 5 port 25 watt one that can charge all 3 my iPad's (one 2nd gen and two 3rd gens) at once and fully charge them from 5-10%. This did charge my phone and cameras good so stay away from this unless you need it for small things. But as I stated this could be a defective one.
1,no good
1,didn't fit my att iphone 4 - had a conector on all four corners whereas the original, authentic has the connector on only three corners. . I ruined my iphone 4 in the process of trying to install anyways.		DO NOT BUY!
1,Cracked after a week they protect my phone screen have to order a new one now but I will order the same one
1,makes phone much heavier, but you are getting more battery life. not 3 times the battery life as advertised, but a good full 2 days with quite a bit of texting and fb use. maybe 3 on standby. it makes the thin s4 about 5/8 inch thick, which kinda makes it easier to hold, but like i said before, much heavier. UPDATE.... WHEN I KEEP PHONE IN MY POCKET THE OVERSIZE BATTERY PRESSES ON THE SIM AND MAKES IT RESET. I GET A MESSAGE SAYING SIM MISSING. ACTUALLY MADE AN INDENT IN THE BATTERY WHERE THE SIM IS LOCATED
1,Dropped my new Galaxy S4 and it cracked.
1,This is NO way shape or form fits the Galaxy S6 phone!!  Waste of time and money
1,After two months the cable is no longer working. It has only seen light and sporadic use as I don't always have need for a 3m cable. I would not recommend purchasing this particular cable for this reason.
1,This screen looked okay however it has several dead spots. Also the speaker grill holes weren't the proper size.
1,Sure there are three rings on the male end, but there are only two wires on the inside of the cable and female side.		Effect: No volume controls or mic.		This will NOT work as an extension for credit card readers.		I wish I could offer zero stars.
1,Offers zero protection for the S7 Edge glass.  Dropped phone from less than 3' and screen shattered, $400 to replace screen.
1,NO GOOD
1,Do not work like my original pin, you have to really press hard to get it respond.
1,This has to be the worst stand that is on the market!  The only thing holding it on the stand is the plug itself.  Unstable for a $1000.00 phone to be on.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY
1,really a terrible fit can not use volume controls,i need to remove the bottom before i can insert fully the usb and the power switch requires much force to initiate,if the outer case gets used  things go even further downhill
1,Way to hard on the right bottoms...
1,the only difference between knees I set of 6 for a dollar fifty is the fact that they say that they're guaranteed for life and they come in a fancy packaging is it off an envelope. That is bizarre the brunt of the mill screen protector and they're no better than any of the others that are very expensive the ones that cost $2 for 6 a.m. My advice is to get a $25 true guaranteed I like screensaver only one comes in a package.  now there's no difference between needs and all the other cheap ones so I'm not saying don't buy this but don't buy into the whole guaranteed for life because will be calling them every month
1,Mini plug to short to make good contact.
1,I thought this was soft silicon rubber but it's not. It's a rubber coated with a clear layer making it hard but not too hard like plastic. It still has a grip. I do like the color. It truly is a minted green. I guess it depends on the seller you buy it from.
1,it dies at like 50 percent
1,It broke in 2 weeks
1,Disappointed with this product.	When I bought it I was told it would read the text and announce incoming calls.	Called customer service concerning this product and they were no help.	I would not buy this product again.	Update  less than six months of use the bluetooth continuously disconnects from the phone.	I have did the firmware update.	I will not replace it with a plantronics.
1,I am NOT 100% satisfied too much money for the protection of the phone. mine already got a scratched. I did not even know how I got it scratched and supposedly it should not get scratch at all. I would suggest you go with a cheaper one steady paying what I paid
1,Did not fit well. Chipped quickly. Replaced with Mr Shield
1,The combo received is a good deal but don't count on colors to be right based on pictures posted. I ordered the rose gold one for my wife and the inside portion was close to rose gold but the outer shell was more pink/copper than rose gold.
1,Very nice item,very useful,thanks a lot
1,iPhone 5C and PC would not recognize this cable nor would it charge the phone. Purchased http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IXP185U (Qable Powerz(TM) Apple Certified Lightning to USB Cable for iPhone) instead and works great.		*edit* Brand X customer support are ignorant liars. I'm not advertising for anyone just trying to help fellow amazon shoppers purchase a QUALITY cable. Brand X Support opened their mouths without learning the facts of my order first. Unfortunate amazon allows pathetic sellers to operate this way. Shoot first, right Brand X Support?
1,Really hard to install and it didn't line up with my phone. Once I DID get it on there, it cracked later that night. Not a high quality back.
1,Doesn't always work. Stops working and restarts only when replugging it in. Same problem with all 3 I bought. I bought 2 Nillkins and they work perfect.
1,My sample was defective and it was a unpleasant of work
1,Knockoff. Broke quickly and does not allow spen  to release. In a single word, garbage
1,Worked fine for a couple of days but somehow got punctured while in the pool and my Nexus 6p is now dead
1,same halo problem does not fit well on the edges
1,These have to be trimmed to fit the screen of my tablet.  I do not like them!
1,Stopped working fast
1,Does not stay in place. Very cheap plastic. Rubs skin horribly and leaves a rash.
1,Original battery is 2100MAH. this one dies quickly.
1,Worked fine for a month or two then the pins that connett to the battery broke, you get what you pay for.
1,Didn't fit my phone properly !!!
1,These leave a good deal of the screen unprotected around the edges. I'd estimate it to be 1/8" on each side. Besides the screen not being protected on the edges it really draws attention to the screen protector.
1,I have repaired over 2 dozen iphone, ipad, ipod screens for family, friends & myself. At least half of these have been iPhone 4S screen replacements.  I won't say it's the worst screen replacement out there but it is the worst I have used and I will explain why below.	PROS:  The screen comes with a protective film on both front & back of the product.  The product comes as shown with tools (though I did not use the provided tools... I did not even take them out since I had a set of magnetized tools for this repair already). They seem adequate but it does not include a mini flat-head screw driver for the two flathead screws inside the phone.  The screen was packaged nicely sandwiched between two foam pieces.  Beyond that, I'm not thrilled about it.	CONS: First & foremost, at the conclusion of the repair, the screen was grainy & the resolution not what it could/should be.  The broken screen was already replaced so I was not replacing an OEM (original) screen.  The first thing I noticed that made me nervous about the screen resolution was how the silver, reflective 'mirror' on the inside of the screen was not in fact a 'mirror'.  (sorry I do not know the parts terminology).  The screen was almost an aluminum foil quality.  I thought that was very odd.  Second big con, and I believe another reviewer stated this, was that the 4 metal corner holes did not line-up to the Verizon phone's frame.  The screws would not easily screw-in due to this. I had to bend & fidget with the metal corner tabs for it to work.  I could have spent twice as much & purchased a better quality screen from a different supplier BUT i wanted to try a new dealer/seller. Plus, spending $40-50 on a screen replacement when the phone itself is due for a free upgrade in another month... it just wasn't worth it.  So I went cheap and received a cheap, poor quality screen replacement.  If this is your 1st iPhone 4s repair... stay away from this product & get a better quality one elsewhere!
1,To cheap
1,I returned this cord because it didn't fit the case that I was using at the time.
1,This is the biggest ripoff case I have ever bought from Amazon. It is terrible quality and cheap material, it fits poorly, and there is literally NO lip to protect the screen from surfaces. Take my advice, and pick a different case.
1,My Note 2 doesn't fit in it, which makes me think they sent me the wrong size, but too much of a hassle to return it. It's not as cute in person as it is in the picture, but that may just be my personal taste.
1,The battery does not fit. It is too Wide and wrong shape at least for my AT&T Samsung Galaxy Note 3. All of them I have seen so far are like mine and that battery would not fit in any of them.
1,Didn't fit
1,Easy to instul but very disappointed with the end results. The screen is very difficult to keep clean, smudges everywhere no matter how many times I clean it, horrible product.
1,A week, immersed in water and broke
1,This tripod is a piece of junk.  It's too lightweight and doesn't hold an iPhone 4 or 5 without coming apart.  The legs are too short to wrap around anything with comfort and ease.  I wish I had never purchased this.  You get what you pay for (cheap = trash) and I want my money back!
1,Not using it. Too big for the phone.
1,I did not like the charge it wouldn't work, the cord works fine just the adapter that you plug in doesn't work
1,I am not very happy with this product, i bought this by reading some	great reviews and its my second bluetooth headphone from Mpow, but	this one has let my expectation down, it doesn't fit in my ears and	always fall down even in normal use, i thought to use it in gym but	there is no way i can use it as it doesn't stick in my ears and I tried all	the earbud that came along with it but none of them stick in my ears.	I am kind of disappointed since i can not use this product though i want	to :(
1,Battery does not keep it's charge too long.
1,The product did not arrive until today 04.09.2015.
1,Does not open wide enough to grab my phone while in its case
1,This phone I don't used because no use card sim and here not active this movi, I lost the money. The phone here without use.		Don't like me this movil, because think that used sim card and I don't nowlech it.
1,I only don't like it because it doesn't have a lip that surrounds the camera and volume buttons. It sits flat on the table and will get scratched. Other wise it is nice, grippy back, fits perfectly, light, PVC not silicone and it is pliable. Easy to get on and off.  I kept it because the price and didn't want the hassle to return it. I won't use it though.
1,I immediately sent this back! I drive a 2015 Toyota Prius Liftback, and once I got this I went and hooked it to my vent. The issue is that when you tighten the thing up to it's tightest, it still doesn't hold the weight of my phone, or my husband's...which means that it either rests right on the radio screen changing your stations, and hitting settings and stuff, or you have to lift the phone so high that it rests on the CD Player, and you can't angle the thing and get it steady like it should be. I promptly processed a return for this puppy.
1,I bought this but didn't last more than 6 months. The silicon pink part of the case started breaking off little by little. In the end it started looking ugly.
1,Would not work!
1,Trash. Doesn't stick on it at all. So garbage
1,This case does not fit well with the buttons. Its very difficult to press power or volume buttons, so screenshots are virtually impossible
1,This says unisex, but does not fit above medium sized people without binding behind the knee.
1,Too many of these drive fail over a relatively short period of time, or don't work on initial formatting.
1,I tested 5 cases side by side.		This case was very square and heavy in my hand. It wasn't as comfortable to hold as other cases. I didn't like the cutouts for the buttons, and the screen protection was non existent. The light used for the battery level was weird. I don't want to have to memorize different colors, just give me an easy to read battery indicator.		I ended up going with the Mophie case: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AX49VBW/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1		If you can afford it, I recommend the Mophie over this case.
1,Cool item, but charges slow
1,My second solar charger from zerolemon, the first shattered under warranty and they wouldn't replace it, this one is all scratched up and hopefully doesn't suffer the same fate
1,BlueAnt Q2 Voice-Controlled Pure Conversation Bluetooth Headset (Black, in BlueAnt Retail Packaging), well very disappointed with this headset, I had the hardest time getting to stay on my ear comfortably and properly, drove me nuts, I have had many headsets in the past, I will never buy another blueant again, the fit on the ear was horrible for me, but that could just be me, sound-wise I didn't have much complaints but I was not "wow-ed" either.
1,works fine for couple of days, then I noticed its start discoloring, when remove and put back the cover on my s7 edge, i noticed start loosing. don't grip the phone very well.		after couple of days its not crystal clear as it should be.	when I contacted the spigen, there customer serivce guy name Derek, came up with all non meaningfull excuses. they are not really behind their product.
1,PIECE OF JUNK. DO NOT BUY!
1,Broke within 6 months.  Waste of money.
1,the product maybe ok for indoors with the brightness on the phone set to max, but outdoors nothing can be seen on the phone screen.
1,First of all, you only get one screen protector. For the cost, you should get 3. Second of all, I consider myself a professional screen protector "applier" in fact everyone I know asks me to install theirs for them. So my point is, I know what I am doing. It was difficult to keep the sides from bubbling up, but I finally was able to get everything down without any bubbles or lint. I let it set over night and after 3 hours in my pocket, the sides are full of lint and now there is no chance for them to stick anymore. What a waste of money.
1,Paper thin. This wouldn't protect against anything except maybe the lightest of scratches.
1,not very good quality.
1,Does not fit the note 4
1,Purched this phone case for the elephant print and the protection it suppose to give for the phone.  When case arrived, it has little shiny beads on it that makes it look feminine. It was purchased for a male. Also i purchased it through Prime memembership. Yet i am being charged for returning it. My refund will be 70 cents and i paid approx $7. Not good.
1,Easy breakable although it works fine charge excellent but whenever you want to fit it breaks easy
1,I've used similar products such as ArmorSuit with great success but had trouble finding the size I needed. This product was close enough so I figured I'd try something new. It's way too thick making the touch screen null & void. I had to remove it to use the device. In this case, you get what you pay for.
1,super thin tube junk
1,it's not sturdy and it's not perfect fit for the device
1,Decent fit. The quality leaves more to be desired.
1,EDIT 2015-04-30: READ THIS FIRST (rated 2 stars)	-----------------------------------------------------	Let me first start by saying that I stand behind everything I wrote originally. The phone is (was) great, but there are well documented, big problems, and Sony has pulled an about-face.		When I bought this phone, the product's title did NOT include the phrase "no warranty," but I was concerned about this, because I had heard of issues of international versions of phones not having warranties honored by the manufacturer. So, when I purchased this phone, I called Sony Mobile, gave them the model number, the IMEI number, the serial number, and every other pertinent piece of information I could find. I asked explicitly whether this phone carried a warranty, and I was told in no uncertain terms that this phone carried a factory warranty everywhere, and that the duration varied by locale, and that in the USA it was one year. So, I opened and kept the phone and used it and loved it.		Yesterday, the phone's vibration motor stopped working. I accessed the device's debug menu (you can get to this by going to the dialer and typing *#*#7378423#*#* (which are the numeric keys that correspond to *#*#SERVICE#*#*, in case you want to remember this easily), and checked the function of the vibrator. It was entirely dead.		Vibration is, in my opinion, a key function of the phone. If you want to be notified of calls without the phone making noise, this is absolutely necessary. My phone is an integral part of my work setup, and I cannot have it ringing dozens of times per day and driving me insane and beeping and blooping for texts and emails and calendar notifications and everything else. I'd be out of my mind in half a week.		So, I called Sony. I was told that I did NOT have a warranty after all and they were quite sorry for the trouble, but anyway, sending my phone to them would take a minimum of 20 business days anyway!! To me, this is absolutely, 100% unacceptable.		I reached out to Amazon for help, and as always, they were fantastic, offering a full refund on the price I paid for the phone. I've ordered a Motorola Nexus 6 to replace this one. It's also unlocked and MOST DEFINITELY has an American warranty.		If you do a bit of searching, you will find that the vibration motor going off is not uncommon on this phone. The glass shattering without good reason is VERY common, owing to the fact that the Z3C does not use Gorilla Glass. The Z3C is a very good phone. There's no way around that. But it isn't without its problems, and Sony is unwilling to stand behind the product. This customer experience is also widely detailed around the Internet. Until Sony is prepared to up their game in terms of servicing this phone and their customers, it cannot be recommended with a clear conscience. After about three months of use, I can also say that the amount of Sony crapware on this phone is a bit much to take, too. There are duplicates of software all over the place, but especially pertaining to the camera.		In short: do not buy this product.		ORIGINAL REVIEW (rated 5 stars)	------------------------------	This phone is identical in size to the iPhone 5S, yet sports a larger screen and feels better in your hand. If you're interested in extremely technical reviews and professional opinions on this phone, there are plenty of them to be found, so I'm going to try to keep this fairly simple and straight-forward, with a focus on real-world applications that matter to me.		I work in marketing, and I work most of my time remotely. I spend an enormous amount of time on the phone, and I prefer to use it on speaker, as wearing a headset or holding the phone to my ear for 6+ hours a day isn't really appealing. I also travel throughout the US and internationally, so I needed an unlocked phone that would work globally with very little fuss. I didn't want an enormous phone (I have a tablet and a laptop, and i like my phones to be unintrusive), though I did consider the Z3 full size strongly. I needed a phone that felt great and wasn't made of the cheapest plastic money can buy. I had put the A#1 Korean manufacturer of phones off my list due to the recent revelations about how their smart TVs and other devices listen to users and serve them up with conversation-contextual ads. That's a level of big brother-ing I'm unwilling to accept. I also wanted a phone that had at least a few options for aftermarket cases, screen protectors, etc.		I was left with a few choices that met my needs, but here's why I went with the Z3 Compact:	- Great battery life and battery management.	- Screen that isn't stupid (you do not need a 4K screen on a small device - these burn through battery and do not improve your phone-using experience).	- Sony's flavor of Android is very usable and doesn't necessitate switching the ROM.	- Phone is dust and water resistant.	- International version of the phone comes with a one year warranty in the US (confirmed by Sony Mobile's support team)	- Phone has a micro SD card slot.	- Phone supports remote play on PS4.		The Z3 Compact feels great. It's fast and lithe, the touch-responsiveness on the screen is very good. The pre-installed apps aren't a bunch of bloatware and junk. Call quality is exceptional. Numerous calls conducted on speakerphone confirm that my voice comes through clearly when using the phone this way. The camera is good, the screen is bright.		By way of cons, there are two small rubber and plastic gasket flaps that you pop up to get at the SD card, USB port, and SIM card. These are atrocious, hard to open, and feel like they would be easy to break. Fortunately, this phone doesn't require extensive use of them, as you can get (for only a few dollars) a magnetic charging solution that bypasses the USB port. The phone is also quite slippery. It seems as though it would be very easy to drop.		On the whole this is a truly great phone. It feels like a large upgrade over my iPhone 5S.		It comes with a stick-on front and back protector film, headphones, charging cable, wall plug (with EU to US adapter), about a dozen languages' worth of manuals, and it's packaged up in a simple box.		Setting this phone up on AT&T with a SIM card was a bit of a pain, though. You will need to set up an APN for the phone (AT&T was able to help, but I'll type out the settings at the bottom as well), and you will need to manually enable LTE under the Network Mode in the phone's settings unless you want to be stuck on HSDPA.		Here are the APN settings for USA AT&T - please note that capitalization, punctuation, and spaces are IMPORTANT.

1,I think I am done buying cases on Amazon.  Everyone I get is these cheap plastic shells that do not even resemble the product on the website.
1,I got this as a gift for a friend of mine.  She only had it a couple of days and traded it out.  This case makes pushing the top button just about impossible.  Too bad, it looks great if you are into that HK kind of thing.
1,keep buying and they keep going bad.
1,There is a lot to like about this mount, but in the end it's just too fragile and wiggly for me. the suction cup lock is pretty amazing though. it would be much better if the rotation was lockable or you could tighten it. it isn't and you cant.
1,The USB charging port  broke the second time i connected it. now i am stuck with it because i threw away the packaging it came with. Really poor manufacturing. Do not buy it
1,Excellent design, but not worth.. Phone fell down, case broke at top left corner and dent on my phone. Very disappointed,
1,Seller got it here on time. The unit came with a bad charger but have a dozen USB Ac adapters around the house so no harm. It really does take a Long time to fully charge it took me 20 hours to get to 4 lights. After having this charger a while i will say it is extremely hard to charge it. It does charge but Never on the 1st night or second night not sure if the unit is broken but i will NOT buy another one. I have used trickle chargers and 5 volt chargers all are Hard to get this thing to move to a charged state.
1,The LCD screen appears to have been slightly too large for the frame.  When sliding it gently into place, it pressure cracked due to not fitting.  I have replaced 10+ screens on iPhones from versions 3g up to 5, and never had this issue with previous items.  Given the seller's refusal to replace, I will now need to find a screen from another vendor and absorb the cost for this defective item.
1,My wife and I got this phone 2 months back and now we both are repenting it. Our brand new phones had hardware issues - my phone's speakerphone sound was cracking and my wife's phone was dropping calls very frequently and randomly. So, we called Verizon to get our phone swapped and we ended up getting refurbished phones as replacements. Within a week after starting to use our replacement phones, both the phones have started to reboot randomly - both while in use and also while in idle state. I called Verizon again today and now we will get yet another pair of refurbished phones as replacements. I am so sick of having to swap phones. I just wish I never bought this one. Google/Samsung/Verizon simply don't seem to get their acts together.		And btw, this is not just one isolated problem. This phone is having too many problems with too many users. Just Google a bit and you would realize its best to avoid spending money on this phone.
1,Do not buy this. It is cheaply made and doesn't stick to the whole screen.
1,My case arrived with no "soft edge tpu ptotection". Just the hard plastic shell and holster. Very disappointing. What I received resembled the "Moona" case for the Note 5. What the hell? Where's the soft edge tpu protection that is shown in the images? However, the hard shell fit perfectly, and slid into the holster securely. I returned it, not what I paid for.
1,Horrible. Doesn't stick to the edge. They make great stuff just not for the edge line
1,I buy a tempered glass protector for every phone and this is one of the worst ones I have had.  The packaging was good but I found the protector to be lacking, especially if you use a case.  It feels cheap and flimsy.
1,I love the color of the case but it did not fit my S4. Maybe I just got a bad one who knows but I returned it and got my money back.
1,After using this dock, I must say that I'm really disappointed.		This dock will charge a naked iPhone. I rarely take off my iPhone case especially at home. This dock for me services as a stand. Which is useless when I need it for charging. The design is excellent. Very stylish and it looks great on my night stand.		The big problem is where the 30pin connector sits or where it is held. If your iPhone has a case, it will not connect flush with the connector. If its a naked iPhone then it works beautifully. For me who always has a case on, this product does not work for me.
1,poor
1,Received a defective unit and they have not reached out, I don't know how to contact them.	I bought the same one for my wife and its amazing so I know something is wrong.
1,Will not stay on the phone at all.
1,It was okay but I thought it was a soft case rubberized
1,I don't leave feedback much but wanted to tell you my side of this note3 case .first off I did lots of research,the case is large and hard to hold in one hand and operate due to the square corners.the kickstand does not work well on it's side it falls over.also when you are done with kickstand it is hard to click back in place ..and the worst part is the front of phone top and bottom edge has no protectiin .so the nice chrome plastic will get ruined from going into holster and pocket.the reason I know this is that I had same kind of case for my s3 .I am sorry to say that mine is on the way back to amazon. I hope you do some reaearch better than I did.
1,this item snapped in several pieces the very first time I opened it to service the phone, I do not recommend this item
1,Doesnt fit correctly to Nexus 4 thought designed for it. The charging slot it not in place where it should. i have to remove this cover if i want to get my phone charged.
1,Not good at all to get it on u have to unscrew your whole phone I ended up glueing and taping it on Mine because I ripped the back off
1,GREAT COLOR! Not as sturdy as the otterbox.
1,Just to warn you not to buy this cellphone used. I bought it used from Amazon Warehouse, and even though it says "Very Good Conditions", it was in terrible conditions. If you're gonna buy it use, ASK FOR PICTURES, I made that mistake.
1,Sunlight shines on that and I'm not able to see the screen
1,this is my third time trying this brand and I followed the instruction and it still peels off after a couple days
1,Works.  But doesn't keep charge for more than three days. Disappointing. Does have enough energy for two iPhones for the charge. That part impressive.  Lights don't always work as is described.
1,this fit my phone perfect but had to return. After less then a week the print was wearing off.
1,This mount broke after only a couple of outings. I leaned my bike against a rail, and it snagged the mount. The clips broke as if they were made from Styrofoam. If I could do it again I would never buy this mount. Cheap. Cheap. Cheap.
1,Old order
1,I liked the look of this case. I MUST have button protection. I saw "fully button protection" noted in the description but was surprised when it arrived to find there was no button protection at all. It was simply cutouts.  I sent it back and made note that the description is not accurate.
