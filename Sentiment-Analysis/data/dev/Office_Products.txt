0,I print a great deal of tax returns for my clients and the Canon CL-41 is less expensive but does a great job of printing the forms just as if it were being printed on the more expensive photo printers.
0,This is the best mechanical pencil ever!  It has size and comfort built into it.  Plus it looks so cool!
0,Excellent price.  Great paper.
0,Oil based pencils. Lay on paper like butter, love them. Worth the money spent
0,Works great
0,This Parker Jotter is of good quality but one needs to understand that it is not one of the quality Jotters that used to be manufactured in the UK. The upper cap barrel has no Parker logo and sounds somewhat fragile while depressed. The engraving is very shallow and not crisp. The P and the R letters in the engraving "PARKER" (the last ones) are somewhat larger than the rest of the font making it inconsistent as opposed to the ones made in the UK. Furthermore, there is only one engraving "FRANCE" where "MADE IN UK" used to be. The brush steel is also of slightly lesser finishing in my opinion. Make no mistake, this pen is still very sturdy overall, just a little less in quality.
0,I have to print a good deal of 11 x 17 plans and for the money this is great.  Not super fast so if you are comparing to a more expensive model for speed you will not be happy. I use this for my home based business & it works fine.
0,Love, love, love this.  It's super cute and does what it's supposed to.  Not going to lie, sometimes when I'm rushing around and I see it I'm like - why is the cat ... oh, wait ... never mind.
0,Great product
0,Excellent product
0,Works fine. The Blue was a nice color. The size is good for a 10" tablet with a keyboard. The pad underneath is detachable, so you can use it on your lap, or take it off depending on your position in a bed etc. Lightweight and the handle hole makes it easy to carry around.
0,The authentic Canon inks work just fine in our Canon printers with no clogs or smearing. Canon ink doesn't dry as fast as HP ink but the image quality is better, at least for the dye based inks.
0,Excellent product!.  How gratifying to order something that turns out to be exactly what you need.  This folder is sturdy, useful, easy to handle, lends itself to many home office or school purposes and can be re-used indefinitely.  Neither hot coffee nor sticky fingers leave lasting damage.  Sections can be labeled for different subjects.  Great way to organize receipts that have to be saved for tax purposes, articles for future reference (like the one I saw today on the pros and cons of buying glasses online), recipes, medical reports, notes and research, correspondence, design ideas, garden information, the list goes on and on.  Label the front in a place you can see it when the folders are grouped togetherstanding up between bookends or stacked in a drawerand your life is suddenly more manageable.  This is the Information Age.  The challenge is organizing the volume of data, and these plastic folders go a long way toward that goal.
0,This is a beautiful pen that writes wonderfully and is well balanced.  It's blue, so I wonder why it comes with black ink; but that's easy to change.  I put blue ink refill in and it now sits in my desk at work.		Cross pens are very well maid and very reliable.  I like the writing feel of this one better than the thin Cross which is so common and so associated with the Cross name.  I also like ballpoint better than rollerball and Cross makes a great ballpoint.
0,Beautiful color. Noodles is always such great quality.
0,Good product.  Would reorder.
0,The Parker Jotter is a very nice, sturdy click pen with a strong clip and a simple elegant design.		I didn't care for the T-ball cartridge that comes with it so I'd recommend either swapping it for a Parker gel cartridge (I use this cartridge in my S&W pen)or the Fisher Space Pen cartridge (my choice for the Jotter).

0,My desk was a mess, pens, posted notes, scissors, etc all over the place.  I was getting so annoyed then I saw this as a lighting deal.  It has so many separate storage areas that everything I use now has its own space.  In addition, it is a nice size and does not take us a lot of space which is a plus because my desk is on the smaller size.  As soon as I got it, I got busy and organized everything and my desk has never looked better.  It is so nice to be able to go right to the thing I need instead of going on a search mission first.  If you are looking for the ultimate desk organizer, you have found it,
0,This kit did the job of cleaning print heads on two different Epsons:  CX4800 and a Workforce.  It is difficult to force the little hoses onto the print-head ports, but it has to be a tight fit to withstand the syringe pressure required for cleaning.
0,If you use a lot of CD labels, this big box of 250 labels will save you money vs the little boxes of 50 labels at Staples. They actually appear to be the same thing.
0,Works well in my 4XL
0,Just look at them! Whats not to like? They also work well as erasers.
0,This calculator does exactly as I expected it to do.  I'm taking finance 300 and needed a good Financial calculator for the class, that was inexpensive yet met my needs.  This one fits the bill, plus it was recommended by my Professor.		I love the PV/FV functionality, but dislike the fact that you can not do complex calculations (such as I do on my TI-84).  But for the price and what the calculator is being utilized for it works well.		So if you're taking a finance class at the university or community college, this calculator is a good fit and I would recommend it.
0,A good printer but only black and white.
0,awesome
0,Excellent for having a small low-cost durable pen in the car, purse, or pocket.
0,Fantastic journal. Very well made & beautiful!
0,a+
0,So far, all colors have worked perfectly and the level indicators appear to work also.
0,works well
0,Super cute. I think it should be sturdy for the upcoming year. I like the quotes and places to write goals for the year. I like that there are monthly and weekly views. I find there is plenty of space to write. I love that it has tabs, I skipped over some other planners because if their lack of tabs. There is a yearly view in the front and a place for a class schedule (I don't need this but its nice if you do). I do kind of wish it had a few more "notes" pages but other than that this planner is perfect for my needs and fits nicely in my purse (exactly what I wanted).
0,Funny for my anniversary card, I always joke that i would kill my husband one day
0,This card has a nice heartfelt sentiment, perfect for a friend who is like family. It is a well made card and is very festive.
0,Love these pens and the price is right
0,I was looking for a slim checkbook cover. Saw this the price was right,give it a try right? Glad I did. It's perfect.	  Maureen
0,Same great markers, excellent low price!
0,Sturdy, strong, wide ruled note books. Our first grade school supply list required three, this pack came with four so we get an extra for home journaling! The covers are sturdy, and notebooks themself are only 70 sheets so not too heavy. Glad to buy on Amazon and beat the back to school shopping rush!
0,Wife loved them, she is all about pink and they work and look great.
0,I like the pen just fine, I was disappointed that it came with a silver nib, I was really hoping for the green one, but I am satisfied with the pen anyway
0,great for the simi blind
0,Quick and easy to install in my Epson printer.  We don't print a lot of things, but when we do, the items come out looking good.  No smudging, excess print ink or discolorations.
0,Great product! I love how strong the magnets are and how well they secure to your light panels. These blue filters seem to aid in calming my students down. Thanks!
0,Perfect for what I needed it for! Made it easy to ship and love that it has the suffocation and ready to ship writing on the bag!
0,Make sure you don't make the same mistake I did and use the CD-ROM included in the box. This printer came out in 2006! I didn't realize this at the time of installing the CD. The install hung and I spent an hour total before realizing what was wrong, uninstalling everything and starting over. When I started over, however, I did so with the use of the drivers from Canon's website. I highly recommend that you do the same. That time the install took about 10 minutes and went smoothly. So, bottom line, great printer but make sure you download the latest software from Canon's site and DO NOT use the included CD-ROM.
0,Highlighters work well
0,good
0,Great
0,I love this because it minimizes the amount of things I have to keep around me when reading--and also minimizes what I have to lug around if i am reading in other places.  I found that highlighting alone doesn't help me much--because it takes too much time to go back and see where I highlighted.  by tabbing the spots also, i can turn right to them.		Post it also has a pen with flags that I like a little better than this--thus the 4 stars instead of 5
0,Great quality fast delivery
0,Cool. Don't have a problem with the staple groups coming apart as others have complained.
0,These Kraft bubbble mailers are good envelops which were shipped very fast quality is great  I will surely order them again.
0,The sharpener does all the work and the container captures all the shavings. No mess and so easy to empty when full. My watercolor pencils are sharp to a fine point which helps me in their use. I would recommend this for home or office use as it is quiet and fast. Does not waste the pencil and standard sizes of all types fit in.  This sharpener is a heavy duty plastic and the front is a thinner clear plastic so you can see. You don't have to worry though because it stops automatically when done. Nice small compact size that doesn't take up much room on your desk. Battery operated and uses 4 AA batteries that you supply so make sure you have them on hand. Wish it took less batteries but is my only complaint.  ***IN EXCHANGE for my true impartial review, my own findings, I received this Promotional Item at no cost.***
0,Great economical product for use just in organizing. Not flashy looking for presentation but they are totally useful. I would buy again
0,This is a wonderful ink. I didn't think an ink could be gray like this - I figured it would have to be just a light black. I was wrong. This is gorgeous, a very different ink color that I love using. It's also completely waterproof. Came in a massive glass jar, excellent value for the price.
0,Perfect
0,My Godfather loves these and the quality is excellent.
0,great choices of color.  I do wish that it came a little thicker.  But these will work
0,The Quartet Magnetic Combination board is a good low budget board that just need a little care. It's not really for kids because it does not mount well, unless you put a nail through it at each corner (which is what I did...I have two kids). I have old feathered plaster walls, and I was afraid that the tape would pull a big piece off if it fell or we decided to remove it. So, with it in place, the board works well. Perfect for posting reminders, school notes, etc. It does not come with an eraser (there is one on the marker cap). It is probably better that way, and it comes off fine with a paper towel. If you put it up like I did, I don't think you will have a problem. The cork is fine for tacking things, and getting fun little magnets for small papers, receipts, etc., are fine.
0,I will only use one-touch binders. I like them a lot and they are very durable for commuting.
0,Very cute. Exactly what I needed for my small binder. Quite sturdy.
0,I just received my order today and I have to say WOW!!!  These checks are beautiful.  They arrived earlier than projected and they are perfect.  They are even shipped in a nice plastic box.		In the past I purchased my business checks thru Intuit.  The last order was for the same quantity (500) and cost me $293.00!!!  AND they took two weeks to receive.		I'm never ordering anything but from Compuchecks again.
0,Nice look and easy to use!!
0,Well made and strong rubber bands.  They really hold up.	Will order more as I need them. A+++
0,For the money it is hard to beat this workhorse of a fountain pen do yourself a favor buy a bottle of ink and a converter cartridge and your cost per fill up drops to just about a dime maybe less and your choice of colors becomes who knows how many buy how about a whole lot.
0,so easy to use great buy!!
0,Exactly what I expected and it was delivered quick and at a great price.
0,The title says it all.  These sharpeners work great.  I bought these to replace my noisy electric sharpener...I am much happier with these.  The point created from this sharpener is finer than anything else that I have ever used.
0,This extra fine tip is a great size for writing 5 events on my competitive swimmers' arms.  Since the lines are thinner, they also wash off/fade from the kids' arms more quickly than the fine tip.  I highly recommend it.
0,I did find one card it wouldn't scan. Someone gave me a clear card! Their card looks cool, but this scanner will not recognize it. Other than that, the scanner and software are perfect. It interfaces with my ScanBizCards app, and has a very low error rate on OCR. There are cheaper products available, but they can't match the quality of the DYMO. The images are perfect.
0,worked great no issues with the dreaded "not recognized" that plagues many aftermarket inks.
0,I like this a lot.  The only complaint I have compared to the picture is that the edges are kind of sharp.  From the picture they look rounded.  Otherwise so far it has worked perfectly for what I'm using it for.
0,GREAt for travel
0,great!
0,Ink is what it says it is...works fine.
0,Like another gentleman said elsewhere, these are fine cartridges ... but ... before installing, read and follow the instructions ... look for and remove all protective sheets.  Also, look for and remove the protective orange clip over the microchip on the cartridge.  (Yeah ... I know it looks like you're going to break something ... it really does come off ... )		You need to pay attention to this, because it's not clearly indicated in the instructions.  Read the review by "Richard C" below.		I thought I had everything right, and for months was dealing with the "Check Toner" message.  The solution ... remove the orange clip.
0,Product was as described. It holds my journals perfectly so that they no longer curl up or flop over.	I would have given it 5 stars, except for the fact that there is no back support for the lowest horizontal compartment, unlike the top and middle ones. From the picture, it appeared that all three shelves had supports.		Otherwise, I am very happy with it, and would recommend it to others.
0,Outstanding pens
0,I looked at a lot of chair mats before I settled on this one. It wasn't the cheapest, but seemed the best and most economical in the long run for my situation. The most common complaint seems to be that the mats are too thin and when used on carpet, the chair leaves dents and is hard to move out of the dents. I have carpet about 1/4 pile. This mat is thick like the ones I used to have at work, and so far does not dent at all on my carpet. I've used it for about six weeks. Another complaint I saw frequently was that other mats were packed rolled or folded and were difficult to flatten out. This one arrived flat, just stapled (not through the mat) between two corrugated cardboard sheets. One caution: if you've been using your chair on carpet without a mat, as I had for several months, take care that you don't go flying because the chair will rolls so much more easily with the mat! Will report back later if I have any problems with durability (another common complaint with chair mats).
0,A big part of my job is documenting grades and behavioral issues each period.  Another big part is writing things incorrectly or putting them in the  wrong place.  Formerly, this meant grade sheets with more white out than actual paper visible.  Not so anymore.		I used standard eraseable pens for a short time years ago while doing crosswords, but I hated the way the ink looked and the inconsistency.  These are nothing like those.		No, they're not as "gel" like as other products, including Pilots ColorJoy gel pens (which are a dream), but they do still have a remarkably good fluidity for an eraseable pen.		I'm not exactly sure what they're made of, but I think its thermal based as I do know that if you write on a piece of copy paper and send it through a laminator the ink will disappear (learned this accidentally when a student sent her daily report card through it).		Also, the eraser on the pen is not like other erasers.  For one, it doesn't wear down.  It also doesn't leave bits of rubber everywhere.  Standard pencil top erasers do not work.		My gripe about these pens is their price considering how quickly I run through the ink.  But I've yet to find something better.
0,Cant go wrong writing on the moving boxes
0,Better than a standard notebook.  much more durable.
0,Product as described.
0,LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE PENS! The one thing that I've found is if you are coloring, make sure to put a blank sheet of paper underneith so you don't ruin the next page.
0,Quick shipping. Reliable service. I have purchased ink cartidges and ribbons from LD products. Will definately purchase again.
0,Works great, I tried the no name refills but had very bad results.
0,The folks at Wastar were kind enough to provide me with this business card case in exchange for sharing my unbiased review...		Love this card case! I own another one that I don't often carry because of it's weight. I loved the case but it only holds a few cards and the mirror inside and metal closure make it add unnecessary weight to my purse. Pretty but strangely heavy for a small item.		So of course when I received this case, I was pretty stoked! It holds a week's worth of business cards, it's got a strong magnetic closure, and it's light! What's not to love, right?		It's a bright, bold shade of red which makes it easy to find in my purse and the PU leather looks and feels nice too. Great find and currently at a great price! Should my opinion of it change after more use, I'll be sure to update this review.		I'm uploading some photos so you can get a closer look. The velvet that they throw in will be perfect for a pair of ear buds or a cord in your purse or for travel. Smile. Buy with confidence. Hope this is helpful!
0,I liked this, only the spiral binding was a little too bulky I thought. Would not buy it again, but liked it.
0,I love it!  I homeschool and needed something to hold up the children's binders.  This is great!  It's only wide enough for one binder per space, but that's all I needed it to do.  It helps keep our space neat and organized.  Each space is about 2.5 inches wide.
0,Have a 24" LCD TV mounted in my ManCave and this system works very well. It was easy to mount both onto the TV and onto the wall. Had it up and running in 15 minutes. Have had zero issues with it.
0,After 6 months this Epson still does everything that I bought it for. Good product for me!
0,Very nice journal, good quality cover. Smaller than I thought as far as spacing goes but very usable and easy to carry a few of these together.
0,Good Deal
0,Good products
0,These labels work great. Also a great price. Thanks
0,Works with my finicky mouse. I have had so much trouble with my mouse - sometimes it works right on the desk but not always, it won't work on top of papers, or on files, or on plywood, or plastic, or cardboard... I finally bought a mousepad - something I didn't ever think I would have to do again. Truly, I should have probably just bought a new mouse, but my hand is used to this one.  Now it works.
0,Love
0,This is a good price, of course Expo is a good brand. I buy these on subscribe and save and send them with my boys to their teachers as a little Thank you gift.  Teachers always need more Expo markers.
0,Works great but voice mail volume is kind of low.
0,Love these universal handed scissors.  When my lefty grandchild uses these she is able to cut things.
0,Stocking stuffers - they loved them!
0,Very nice leather and thick paper. Was a wonderful gift. This product was exactly what I was expecting. I would order again.
0,great
0,I wish the pencil caddy was a little bigger, but I love this tray.  It makes my desk look so nice!
0,Great colors with just the right thickness of the drawn lines.
0,I love these colored pencils! They blend easily and have bright hues.	Helpful hints:	-Premier has an instruction video that gives you tips on how to color and the various ways to blend these colors. Super helpful.	-I highly recommend also purchasing the blender pencil from premier. In the image below, I used the blender pencil on the bottom most orange leaf. You can tell it really makes the colors pop!	-You'll eventually want to get more colors. Option 1: Get a bigger pack or Option 2: Get a small pack and buy specific individual pencils (what I did) at a local art store	-The 24 pack doesn't come with grey. It's clear about this and you can always lightly shade with black but it isn't the same. You'll want to find a way to obtain a grey.	-If you're coloring and you're getting 'dust' you're pressing too hard. You have to lightly layer several times to get a deeper hue.	-Buy a manual pencil sharpener that's specifically for soft cores. Run of the mill pencil sharpeners won't work well and lead to lead breakage and frustration (learned this one first hand).
0,excellent three hold legal binder.
0,These are just what I needed. I love the convenience of just pushing a button at work and having supplies like these delivered before I would have had time to go get them.
0,Love it use it to hold several item
0,Will purchase again!
0,thanks
0,This is one smooth and quiet running machine. The large bin holds a lot of material and is easy to remove. It rolls around smoothly on my hardwood floor. I am pleased with my purchase.
0,These work so much better than the regular Sharpie on plastic and glass.  I tried to smudge them and even after putting a few things in the freezer the writing didn't come off or bleed like the regular ones have done to me in the past.  I hope they come out with the extreme in all the colors so that when I'm drawing on tiles it will stay longer.  Worked nicely on my granddaughter's windbreaker and this way no one else can claim it.  I even put the windbreaker through the washer and the ink stayed in tact without any problems.  These are worth their weight in gold to moms, artists or just anyone who needs a good marker.  I highly recommend them.
0,I like it how this product is very easy to store and easy to use and doesn't involve giant dangerous blades like on traditional paper cutters.  However, if I don't hold my hand just right as I'm cutting, the blade might tilt a bit, and the cut isn't straight.  I'm still getting used to it.  I find that I have to try a few times before getting the straight cut that I want.
0,Perfect for my Wife's purse.
0,Love the dark blue that it gives :) favorite ink for sure
0,I like it, but the jury is out if I love this pen.	1. Grip is not as comfortable as the original Dr. Grip Pen.	  (Not only that when you check the Pilot Website for USA this pen is not even listed.)	2. Yes the refills are tough to find and after reading the reviews I decided to get the Zebra pen refill instead.  I just may come back and update this later as to how good the refills were.  Had read that the Dr. Grip refills arrived dry.  Notice that this pen has a plug in the refills as well and curious as to function, also if will hinder performance.	3.  The tip looks awful fine for being .7mm ball tip.  I even checked the stock numbers to verify.  If I could I would measure the tip, but I figured a picture would do comparing the original Dr. Grip.	4.  Smooth writing pen and looks great
0,This is a great organizer for office supplies.  I put this item on my desk and now whenever I am looking for a pen, a paper clip or note pad, it's there right in front of me.  Great color too.
0,I need to clean up my desk and this helped a lot.		The mount is strong, well made and easy to assemble. Adjusting the mounting positions isn't hard and will need to be tweaked a bit to make it perfect.		Being able to rotate from landscape to portrait is great for graphic design and reading.		Not make for every desk or table but for most. As others, I did need to modify my desk to accommodate the mount.  Not an issue with the mount by my deask.
0,My go to brand and product for pens. These arrived quickly and undamaged. The pens facilitate smooth writing and that inky look that is bold yet does not bleed.
0,great product for the price and good quality too and got it for less than $1 works great and looks nice too
0,Works great, arrived quickly with prime.
0,We use Sharpies in our office as well as in many of our camp crafts. They write on paper, plastic, wood, and leather.
0,Its a mouse pad, does its job. No complaints
0,good quality pencils in a world where all other pencils are not good quality.
0,So far this has worked wonderfully! I have used this several times before posting this review. I have no complaints.
0,Using on our chalkboard painted wine glasses! So far/so good!
0,a little slow to heat up , but worth the wait, it's a very good product for the price and works on all our kids art works and important notices !
0,I purchased this calculator in 4 different colors (pink, green, yellow, blue) and I'm very happy with my purchase. The colors are bright and beautiful and the calculators work great! I definitely recommend these calculators to everyone!
0,it could be a little more user friendlyh.  Rarely use it because I need to take a class to understand how this thing works.
0,Read the dimensions carefully. I was surprised by how large it really is. Each sheet is only one month--not two. My only complaint is that the bottom of the sheets don't have a peroration so you can't use a thumb tack to keep it from blowing due to ceiling fan close by. I use this calendar to keep up with FT work and FT master's degree due dates.
0,Happy
0,I use this for my classes works great nice and strong
0,These work as advertised.
0,Fast drying time.  Excellent pen!!
0,I bought an extra Ooma Scout to use in another room. It is an EXCELLENT buy! Works instantly when you plug it in...of course you have to have the Ooma Hub for it to work. It has voicemail, line 1 and line 2, and is just like the Hub.
0,Excellent size portfolio for carrying my 11x17 shoot targets.  Keeps them from getting wrinkled and dirty.
0,As described - great price!
0,Always the first place I go to purchase printer cartridges!  Great value for a great product!
0,This file box is easy to assemble and sturdy enough to hold a lot of files. I would recommend this box to anyone.
0,Just the right size for my desk top. And plenty of room to make notes. Great job. Thanks
0,Paper is thinner than the Piccadilly journal I had been using. Gel pen goes on very nicely, fountain pen will have some slight bleed tot he backside and due to thinness the writing shows through to the backside just enough I will only be writing on the front sides (less economical but also does not require reaching across the binding to write). The cream paper is just the right color. The exterior would not fool you into thinking it was leather but does not feel cheap. Overall an excellent bargain!
0,Very good quality for the price point. Would absolutely buy again without hesitation. Ran through the printer fine.
0,Excellent quality! Very happy and would order again with no problem!
0,1st this unit is light weight, love the feel and design.  I needed a good quality scanner without paying top dollar.  After reading other reviews I'm not upset to say the least.  The scan isn't super fast, but scans in seconds and at least there isn't any warm up time.  So far had to adjust reds on one scan and brightest on the other, fairly easy with the bundled software.  Also could not manipulate cropping from the touch buttons, maybe within a month I will figure out.  Cropping is very easy from within the bundled software.  After setting up the unit to scan slides it took me about 20-30 minutes to realize I had to restart the computer.  The scanned image from the slide came out excellent.  I can't believe I almost purchased a more expensive unit.  I highly recommend this unit!  Purchased on mega sale for under $70.
0,Excellent mat. Does the trick with no problems.
0,Better price than staples for high quality tray
0,A few years ago my Tombow pen ran out of ink.  I spent the better part of day trying to find this item in my local town.  I was not successful.  I found and ordered the refills on Amazon, all in less than one minute.
0,Good price and quality.
0,beter than the phone I have now.
0,I love these! The glitter is showy, and they write so smoothly you wouldn't believe they're a glitter pen! I just adore these.  The colors are pretty! They last a long time, too, so they're a great value.
0,Sound is clear and works throughout our 1800 sq foot condo - concrete and steel walls, floors and ceilings. Have not had any issues with this product. Can be set to announce who is calling, which I find handy. Answering machine also works well and is easy to set up and use. You can set it to pick up after a certain number of rings - I have VM though the phone company also, so I set this one to pick up first. if I am on the phone and a call comes in, then my VM through the phone company will pick up that voice mail. I am sure though that the voice mail on this machine will still pick up if you are on the phone when another call comes in; I just do not have mine set up that way. Have used VTech products for years and honestly like them better than ATT and Panasonic.
0,Great price shipping this is where I buy all of my shipping supplies
0,I give a set of these to my mail carrier every year. I bet she's getting sick of them by now!
0,good product
0,Works as intended, no hangups with leads and blade.
0,I have used many different paper cutting devices, and those manufactured by Carl are superior to all others.  The blade's cuts are smooth and accurate.  The perforating blade is perfect for scoring a hand stamped card to produce a bookmark.  Several stamps, especially those by Magenta are the ideal size and shape.  Once the card is read the recipient is left with a permanent reminder.
0,Excellent. Good colors and so colorful. They do not smear on your paper and last long. They do not bleed. I had these for 2 years and it still has ink. Perfect highlighters for school or buisness.
0,Has survived over a year of heavy use by my kids.
0,HP means good quality!
0,For years I used this tape and my friends house and finally I bought it online, only that I don't have much uses for it. Good quality.
0,Very good price
0,I teach math in high school and I use a lot of board and this eraser clears the whole board so feast. I love it!!
0,Perfect deal, very nice pen from zafari line
0,Such a surge of nostalgia seeing this pen! The arrowhead on the clip in particular. I'm reminded of receiving a pen that I think was identical. Identical looking anyway, because with the gel cartridge, it feels like a different pen. There's no drag whatsoever, it moves super smoothly across my test paper. I really like it. It's a pen thats worthy of the special occasions memorialized by handwriting and/or signatures. New home closing papers, birth announcements, anniversary and birthday cards, etc come to mind. I like that I can switch between gel and regular ballpoint ink refills. I prefer writing with gel, but it's not the right choice to use with some cardstock and glossy finished paper. Those require ballpoint ink that doesn't smear. For keepsake moments and special occasions that require putting pen to paper, one needs a special pen. This Parker Jotter is worthy of being that pen.
0,Great product and prices and great service, and would buy again
0,Glue sticks. So many uses. Good deal for the big bag. I recommend
0,I simply love them.
0,GREAT PAPER.  All I can say is that this is some of the best paper I've ever used.  Super high quality for use with fountain pens --the paper is just exactly right, allowing the ink to sit on the surface without absorbing like a sponge and making a feathery mess--. And the grid is really great for keeping your handwriting consistent.  HIGHLY recommended.
0,Gets the job done!  I purchased to ship product dold online in so I kinda' wish they didn't say CHEAP MOVING BOXES on the outside...I didn't realize I was paying to advertise for the company.		They work well.
0,I initially thought I would need to return it since the monitor kept tilting forward after mounting.  Luckily, I double-checked the instructions and found the adjustment screw location to tighten up the tension.  It holds position now just fine.  I'd buy this again.
0,I love getting supplies delivered right to my door!  These staples fit right in my automatic stapler and I was able to get on with my work!
0,Product is as expected!
0,After getting tired of the garbage pens stocked in my office supply cabinet a long time ago, I have been trying out different pens in search of a really good pens at an affordable price.		I first tried a few Zebra F301 ink pens; I liked these quite a bit, but as I tend to misplace my pens these ended up being a bit expensive, plus I had trouble finding the medium point (1.0mm) I preferred. I then found the Zebra Z-Grip Retractable Ballpoint Pen, 1.0 mm, Black Ink 12-Count which wrote pretty well and was cheap. I have been using these for at least the last four years.		Recently I got hooked on the idea of gel pens and tried a few, including the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/BIC-Triumph-730RT-Gel-Pen-0-7mm-Black/dp/B004GEC2IY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">BIC Triumph 730RT Gel Pen (0.7mm), Black</a>, the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/uni-ball-Signo-Gel-207-Retractable-Roller-Ball-Pen-Medium-Point/dp/B000FDR47E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">uni-ball Signo Gel 207 Retractable Roller Ball Pen, Medium Point</a>, and these Pilot G2 Fine Point pens.  It's a close call between the Pilot G-2 and uni-ball 207, but in the end I preferred the uni-ball.  Though both are 0.7mm gel pens, I think that the writing of the 207 is just a bit crisper than that of the G-2.  In addition 207 looks a bit more professional than the Pilot G-2, seems a bit less prone to smearing, and at least at current prices the 207 is less expensive than the G-2.		That said the Pilot G-2 is far superior to the BIC 730RT and any inexpensive stick pens I've used and still my second favorite pen at the moment.  At the right price I would not hesitate to buy them again.
0,Good basic ink, cheap.
0,Got this dual labelmaker at a nice price from an amazon secondary seller to replace a long serving dymo single spool non-turbo labelmaker.  I went for the dual as the price was only a bit more than a single though honestly i haven't used the second spool yet.		my needs are basically to print mailing labels, not postage.  i see a lot of people complaining about the postage printing system, but as that does not affect me, my review does not reflect this.		what i do see is fast, reliable, no-nonsense high quality printed labels.  i am familiar with the dymo label software from my previous printer.  it's a nice interface and easy to use and it's also surprisingly easy to print from other applications.		in case i haven't made it clear already, i think the dymo line of printers is a winner.  i look forward to the servce of this printer for years to come.
0,Great for scrapbooking, paper crafts or just to color for fun!  beautiful colors!
0,High quality cartridges, good price and I have bought from them many times...
0,Twelve South's SurfacePad is an excellent way to protect your macbook.		1) My macbook pro's surface area was protected from smears and smudges	2)  Protects from liquid spills, oils, dirt	3)  Shields from impact from potentially dangerous harmful elements able to be dropped on or bumped into your macbook's body.		Nice purchase if you're in the market.
0,Nice, I just went back in time in my High School.		Texas Instruments rocks. period!!!
0,I love these pens. I own them in pink, purple, blue, and black.  They write perfectly.  The refills are also reasonably priced.  The pink is so pretty.
0,Great product.
0,I love sheaffer. It's my favorite  pen. I have several $350 pens and when I get ready to use one, I take off the top, try it, shake it, open it and squeeze the cartridge, sometimes stick then under the faucet to get the ink started. Sheaffer, works right away, no shaking, I LOVE SHEAFFER. Co-workers ask me to write labels and tags for them because my handwriting looks great only with my calligraphy pen!!
0,As advertised.  Great service.
0,Slider removes staples from remover.
0,good
0,I use these to keep my paperwork clean at work and they serve that purpose perfectly. Also perfect against the elements for keeping your paperwork dry and smudge free.	Great product and perfect price - thanks Amazon!
0,My favorite Sharpie ever. The ultra fine point is amazing! I never had one before and cannot believe this was missing in my life. I can write things so much cleared on plastic lids, lunch boxes etc than I ever could with the normal Sharpie that I think is really for suited for cardboard boxes. I love these so much that I bought a pack for my mother to have at her house and I bought 3 more packs for myself so now I have one Ultra Fine Point Sharpie in every room!
0,I am using these to write the names of the girls attending my bachelorette party on the dual walled plastic cups. I tried them out and they work great! The marker does not come off if you wash them and that's perfect, I want this to be a keepsake after the party. The colors are nice and I'll be able to make great little gifts with these!
0,This is nice, good price. Scotch tape is scotch tape, can't beat it. And the dispenser is nice.
0,Love these. I had bought a few other budgeting books prior to the Wilson Jones set (binder too). Others tended to be too restricting (providing specific categories for you), too condensed (budgeting a whole month on one sheet, with little to no room for you to actually write information in), or too generic (little to no guidance, just lines across a page, with little to no organization). I love that this provides ample space for you to write in descriptions as well as simplifies the budgeting process with incoming, outgoing, and balance areas. Will definitely be using this for years to come.
0,Is there really much to review about these? No fraying, long lasting and a good size. Minimal smearing/staining. Great value for money.
0,Love it, so far. It took a second to get used to the rotating tip, but it seems to work beautifully. My only concerns are the small eraser and cap. I can see this getting lost in a hurry, but hopefully not. Second best feature is the retracting tip. No worrying about ripping your bag because you can slide it smoothly into a pen slot.
0,as expected
0,Wonderful beginners set, perfect for learning to blend colors.  The pencils are nice quality and well worth the price.
0,The fine tip markers work great and the cleaner is fantastic for anything that's been left on the board for a month +.  The eraser is an eraser nothing special there. The only thing I wish it came with extra would be maybe a microfiber or suede cloth for the cleaner portion. I don't suggest using the eraser along with the cleaner, this just streaks the marker.
0,Excellent!  I use them for much more than paper binders.
0,I'm an office supply addict. My absolute favorite pens are the old school Bic blue crystal ballpoints and it takes a lot to get me to switch (even with my love of office supplies). These pens are great. They're a little rounder than my usual pens, making them a little easier to grip. Smooth ink release when you write. No clumps. Deep black color.
0,This was a gift to go along with an adult coloring book, she said they great.
0,I use quite a few rubber bands in the office.  So far, these have done the job well.  Would have given them a 5, but I haven't had them that long!  So far, so good
1,At $400 I can't see why anyone would buy an inkjet printer rather than a color laser printer.  On a positive note, this seems like a great design for a light duty inkjet printer.  Only time will tell if the ink works long term though.  Previous inkjet printers constantly were having quality issues and needed cartridges replaced frequently.		I like the little color display, much nicer than a boring B&W LCD screen.		I give Epson kudos for having a decent system for entering your wireless password without an actual keyboard, this is much easier than previous designs I've used.		Set up was fairly easy.  I really like the design for the ink, but beware this approach does mean that it is fairly easy to spill ink on your fingers.  Print quality seems typical of an inkjet.		Beware: it only works on a wireless network that supports 2.4GHz (which I assume almost all do) (or you could use a USB cable)  I still think Epson should include a hard wired network port for those that don't want to use wireless (but want it further away than a USB cable would work).		If you are used to having a personal scanner, this is really nice to have a networked scanner for light duty usage by all computers in the house.		Update: The printer worked nicely for several months.  But when/if it loses power it seems to lose the WiFi connection (which is a royal annoyance if your password is secure and hard to type).  Now I can't get it to connect at all (even though the network status sheet prints out that everything is fine and connected).  So I'm stuck with a printer that reports that it can't connect ("Communications Error") and nothing seems to help.  Epson's website basically says they have updated to a newer security certificate and will no longer connect from WinXP. I've been unable to find any info from Epson.  My next step is to try and delete the driver and re-install it on my computer.
1,This is so poorly designed it should simply not be sold!!! It is a piece of crap!! They designed it to be pushed but since that was causing the swivel wheels to break off they decided to blame it on the customers and now send the replacements with a sign that tells you to pull it instead of push. RIGHT! Then why are the swivel wheels on the front? Plus the thing is made of extremely weak aluminum. The ONLY thing it can carry is four-square balls out on an asphalt play ground. It is not good for anything like groceries.		The front swivel wheel broke off after a couple of weeks of use. I thought it was probably just defective the first time. They nicely sent me a new frame. This time it had the Pull, don't Push sign on it. Even with pulling, the new one lasted only 5 trips before one of the pull back wheels sheared off. (See photos.)		I am sad and embarrassed to say that I sold many of these at a store I worked for. THEN I bought one myself. I am disgusted by this product. It makes me seriously distrust all things Polder. I hope this review saves a couple of people from buying this piece of crap!
1,Don't like the sticky notes. They're like plastic. I may throw them away and try to attach my other sticky notes on the holder.
1,It's hard to image how anyone could mess up such a basic product, but they managed.  The paper slip to write on is incredibly flimsy.  Once you pull it out to write on it, you can't push it back in.  It might have increased their manufacturing cost by a fraction of a penny to make the labels out of stiff cardstock, but instead they chose to produce a poor quality product at the expense of the customer.
1,I would like it but it has to be reset A LOT and it seems to error frequently. Had problems with last hp printer too and now I'm thinking it was a mistake to do hp again.
1,They were very inexpensive, and preformed worse than my lowest expectation.
1,Setup is a real pain. It ONLY works on 802.11b networks, ONLY 2.4 GHz, and your router must have NO spaces in the SSID OR the password. Oh, and that no-space-having password MUST have numbers and letters. No spaces allowed, but numbers and letters are required. Why? I guess because it's easier to hack (google XKCD Password Strength, and you'll see what I mean). Oh and if setup fails, there is no reset pin-hole button, you have to remove the batteries from the back, pop them back in, and start all over again each time. The good news is once you have it configured correctly, all you ever have to do is stand on it. There's no need to have an app or program running on your phone or computer, it simply sends the data directly to the Fitbit servers. Is that convenience worth all the effort of changing all your non-N home devices to match a new SSID and password? Eh, sorta.
1,The quality of the material is good.  But the graphics...who knew the US flag colors were brown, white and black?  It's made in Taiwan so they may not know.  But the quality control from the company that markets this leaves a lot to be desired.
1,My old Sharp dictionary/crossword solver recently died and this "new and improved" version is a poor replacement. Everything is now in categories so if a name comes up, you can't just look it up unless you know who, or what, this person is and then you have to navigate through dozens of sub-categories ,and hope there aren't too many letters in the name since they're listed by number of letters and you can be scrolling forever. It is, truly, a stupid format full of time wasting turns. Even the category titles are too large for the display so there's a more than good chance that you won't find what you're looking for. There are NO names in the dictionary at all! You would think that if all names are omitted from the dictionary, there'd be more room for words but that's not the case. Several clue words, and as many answer words, are just not here having been purged from the dictionary and placed into a sub-catagory. Unfortunately, the whole thing ends up being a complete mess and incredibly frustrating. Someone tell me why you'd need a Span/Eng dictionary to do a crossword puzzle. This thing is just a bunch of features that are all lacking in sense and workability, with too little words to be effective as a dictionary or anything else. It's like riding a bike with tons of cool bells and whistles that forces you to walk because the wheels don't have enough spokes to support the junk. Here are a few ideas that might help: Eventually, someone will develop a crossword puzzle app which will be constantly updated by the people who use it or you can use Google to answer questions like "What is Hadrian famous for" since he won't pop up, because he's not listed in the dictionary(!!!) unless you already know he was a Pope and then go to 'famous people'> religious figures> pope's and scroll down (7 letters, so he's WAY DOWN the list) to find near zero info on the guy. So go with a smart phone or wait for the app or just look at the answer in the back of the book. All of these will be more satisfying than using this thing which can best be described as a pointless product that owns many features that ALL fall short. This item actually makes doing a crossword puzzle less fun than it should be and that's what you'll get with this. Lots of so-so with zero wow and no improvements anywhere. However... If you like to do super E-Z puzzles with incredibly simple words (including Spanish) with no expectations of a challenge, or even a simple answer, then this is for you. Otherwise, it also works well for propping up a wobbly table.
1,I had a perfectly good HP all-in-one but was tired of the ink prices so, after a bit of research, decided to try this.		The most important feature for me was a second tray for photo paper which this has, BUT.. you have to switch to it manually.		Had I known this ahead of time, I never would have purchased it. Our HP lets us choose the tray via the software, even from the I-Pad		The AirPrint guide, which I had to download from their web site, is useless, but we have managed to print 4X6 prints from an I-Pad locally		Print quality is good, and ink is about half the cost of HP
1,Lots of static and nearby electronic interference pick up by this phone.
1,Gums up rollers and jams constantly ALSO YELLOWS IN LESS THAN TWELVE MONTHS		hugely disappointing
1,Not good at all! It dries out and when you print anything, the words crumble off! Very disappointed!
1,I get that they're disposable, but sheesh, they just feel so.plastic. The flow is just OKI don't hate it, but I hate holding them. For a few dollars more you can do better.
1,after 1 day trash with brother printer and order other brands
1,Yes, free phone service sounds good and is a huge savings - but ... the Magic Jack only works 50% of the time.		Often we can't receive calls in, or make calls out. We have to reboot the computer a couple of times per day.		Luckily, we don't use the phone much and we have cell phones, so this is not a huge deal, but still a concern.		The Magic Jack still needs improvement.
1,I can't even begin to tell you what a mess this was. It was like a comedy act. Under the product description it says "Simply stack up to 300 sheets for automatic shredding, lock the lid and walk away". It should say "Simply stack up to 300 sheets for automatic shredding, lock the lid and walk away, and the shredder will start to shred, jam, try to shred again, then just sit there". Or it should say "Simply stack up to 300 sheets for automatic shredding, lock the lid and walk away and you will only have any success if you stack those sheets perfectly aligned without staples, paper clips or even a folded page".		I was so frustrated with this thing that I ended up ripping apart some of the papers rather than shred them. It was quite humorous, I was a better shredder than the shredder.
1,Spacious envelopes which could hold a CD or DVD or in my case, for my etsy shop, several bottles of nail polish... They seem well padded and all that jazz, but they don't stay sealed! I'm super glad that I didn't take this package straight to the post office and drop it in the mail box. It was sitting on my desk for about an hour and when I walked back by, I saw that the flap had completely come unstuck! I put some tape on it, which I'm sure will make it fine for delivery, but that's sort of annoying. I know these envelopes were priced nicely, but I guess I still expect them to do the job they advertise doing. Now I have 50 envelopes which will need to be sealed with tape to ship out. I've used several of them and even gave the next batch to ship out the benefit of the doubt and waited to see if they would also pop open. I left them sealed on my desk and when we got back from dinner, they had all popped open completely.
1,Get what you pay for..... not, Good Quality plus have 3 newer ones had to change other New Ones from another Vendor because of the Poor Print Quality
1,NOT EVERY CARTRIDGE WAS GOOD-SOME WORKED BUT-TWO OF THE CARTRIDGES WERE DEFECTIVE--EASIER TO JUST THROW AWAY BUT WE WILL NOT BUY FROM VINK AGAIN.
1,The pockets are unusable - they are too small to hold standard 8 1/2 x 11 paper without folding them up.  Not worth the effort to return.  Seems to be of good construction so if the pocket size isn't an issue for you, it is a nice notebook.
1,Horrible. The pieces don't fit together properly. The instructions say to put a screw in middle and that's not even where the holes are. Then you have to put shelf part upside down which means the white instead of black is showing because once again it doesn't line up. And no we didn't do it wrong.
1,Opened mine and everything seemed fine out of the box. Put a roll of tape in and left it on the desk. Went to use it the next day and upon tearing a piece of tape off, the serrated-metal tab that tears the tape lifted right off with the tape. I guess they're dumping their faulty ones off on Amazon. Sounds about right. I'll probably just super glue it in so I don't have to mess with returning it. I feel like I'm buying stuff from Walmart sometimes when shopping on Amazon.
1,I bought this scale 3 months ago and used for weighing packages for shipping. I used for less than 10 times.	The way of testing if the scale reports a right number is weighing my iPad Air LTE model, which is 478g.	At first the scale reported the right number.	But now it reports 576g, which is 20% error.	Hence I doubt the quality of the scale.
1,I ordered this and when it arrived it would not even turn on, so I returned it to Amazon.  I realize things sometimes happen like this.  Got the replacement a day later and used it twice.  It ate or ruined basically 50% of what I laminated and I laminate a lot.  Several pages got stuck inside and many more had crinkled edges.  I think part of the problem is the slot it just barely big enough to fit a laminating sheet in, so it gets caught on the sides.  I have just sent in a request to return this one and get a refund. In the mean time I went with another brand as I do have to have a laminator at all times for my work.
1,One was broken, and there were three colors that were duplicated!
1,I like how the product is built and designed but unfortunately I got inconsistent performance out of it. Sometimes it would sound ok (or at least I did not get any negative feedback) but in other cases I got complaints from the other side that I'm not coming across well and people have asked me if I'm in a tunnel... I felt I could not trust that speaker, and especially at this price point.
1,It does NOT work!!!!!!
1,These refurbished cartridges were fine at first then they did not work at all, and I returned them for a very satisfactory return policy.
1,...but if they are, you may be deemed to be "on contract" and be prepared to shell out an extra $100 ($10/mo times 10 months) over a regular Ooma Telo, even though you are not advised of these additional terms and conditions. I would strongly suggest, if you want to go this route, that you buy it directly from Ooma, but they say Costco units also don't have these charges. I know it is hard to believe, but there are lots of one star reviews by people who have had the same problem. More than once Groupon has sold these refurbished for a discounted price (I saw an ad for $79, but Ooma advised mine cost $99 originally), "bundled" with a ten month contract for their Premier service. Unfortunately, a subsequent purchaser is not going to be aware of this unless the seller so advises. Ooma doesn't seem to care that the Groupon units might be resold without any disclosure of these extra charges. The machine's IP address causes the system to consider it subject to the Groupon terms (but there's no way for an innocent non-Groupon purchaser to know that). I was sold one of those Groupon machines for $137 by an Amazon Marketplace vendor. Ooma refused to stop charging the $10 a month and told me to get in contact with the vendor; the vendor initially told me they only sell hardware and to get Ooma to drop the charges. Ooma was adamant that it would not drop the charges, but finally was willing to sell me another unit for $99 (apparently the amount my unit originally cost). I was not willing to throw good money after bad, so after two days working the phone we agreed that if I cancelled my service the charges would stop. I decided to file a complaint with Amazon, in the form of an AtoZ claim (turned out to be the day before the deadline), not expecting much: two days later, the vendor issued a full refund, advised that I should keep the unit, that it was a big misunderstanding on everybody's part, and asked that I reconsider my feedback. I am keeping this review at one star as my experience was and remains terrible, and I think it is important that potential buyers be able to find experiences like this by looking at one star reviews, but I have removed the name of the vendor and otherwise reorganized and edited to make this more coherent, neutral and useful to people considering buying one. I'm far from whole at this point: I was charged $10 too much for three months, wasted $39 on Ooma porting, lost my old number (because I didn't port the number before cancelling Ooma-not that its practical to do that in situations like this) and have wasted another $30 on a T-mobile prepaid bought solely for porting the old number from Ooma. A lot of money down the drain considering the service claims to be free. Depends on what your definition of "free" is, I guess. The Ooma's going to the landfill (considering a new owner would probably be hit with Premier fees PLUS a $79 reconnect), soon to be replaced by something that actually has free service: an Obi202.
1,Kept jamming my printer, and would never properly print a single page. Tried for over an hour, to no avail. Already outside of my return window, so I'm chalking this up as a loss. Lesson learned- buy the OEM unit.		*update*	Okay, so it's not a total loss. I was able to pry off the little cap and dump out all of the toner, and refill my OEM toner cartridge. Youtube it to find out how to do so.
1,Three stars as very expensive and now all printers have a software chip that allows it to react differently if original brother ink is not used.  Total scam as it they try to make you buy branded overpriced ink, non brand is 1/5th the cost
1,This is my second batch of cartridges. The first batch operated fine, but I seem to have gotten a bad cartridge this time with the black toner. I get repeating black smudge lines across the paper from edge to edge. The "cleaning" operation on the printer seems to have no effect, but if I remove the black cartridge and wipe the roller clean with a soft cloth, then the printouts come out fine for awhile, until the roller gets dirty again.		My experience might be a rare occurrence, but it has been stressful enough that I will probably try a different brand next time.
1,I am guessing the product is old because it doesn't stick to anything, not even paper to paper.  don't buy.
1,This did not work in my HP printer. It identified them as not original equipment and would not work.  I had to discard them and get new original HP cartridges.
1,If I could give zero stars I would. The pen is so scratchy. I understand it's very thin needle point but not worth it. It needs to have a smoother flow. But def would not buy again.
1,These weren't terribly expensive, so it's not surprising that they weren't the best quality. The colors were pretty, but they did not last long. I'm not sure if this was a quality issue exactly or a design flaw, but I'd only had the pens for a week when some of the colors started to run out, and it wasn't as if I were covering my walls with ink or something. I really don't think any product should last for such a short period of time. I would have returned them if I hadn't used them enough to feel that it wasn't fair given what I paid.
1,I sent this back and got a desk mount instead.  The height that this sets the monitors at is really high, you have to put it below the desk to have monitors at the correct height.  Defeats the purpose in my opinion.  There is also no way to adjust the height of the monitors individually, to match up two different brands.		Otherwise the unit seems to be constructed well.  Just very awkward to use.
1,Had l lot of issues with the lead breaking when attempting to sharpen the pencils
1,I just go this chair on 2/26 and already its failing. Just sitting down on it the cylinder starts to lose pressure and I slowly sink down. I am not happy with this at all. Fail within 72 hours of using this chair.
1,We have the Uniden cordless phone, and recently had some problems with the battery lasting less than a day on a charge. Consequently, I tried to call customer service, however Uniden only offers email customer service. I finally found a Texas number for them where one has to pay to call them		This is a far cry from Panasonic or Sony which both offer free, toll-free support. Apparently, Uniden is too cheap to offer a toll-free support number, and they want you to pay for the phone call. To add insult to injury, when I did finally call their pay support number, I had to wait twenty minutes for someone to answer. Simply pathetic. I would avoid this company. Apparently Uniden does not want to put any money towards customers, so why should customers pay for their phones?
1,it doesnt taste right for me
1,I purchased two AT&T portable phones which are great so far. But this answering machine is not a simple machine to set up. It also lacked the 2 connections in the back I need to connect the machine, so it didn't work. However, setting the clock, options is a real pain.	I will return the item and use my old 16 year old GE 90s answering machine that does the job just as well.
1,The wireless component on this baby is very finicky.  Also, it is somewhat annoying to set up The wireless connection. It's not reliable if you need to print something immediately.  Otherwise, the quality is terrific.
1,There should be way more ink in these for the price. They run out quickly. I am unimpressed with the cost and how many pages I can print using the least quality setting.
1,Why buy this overpriced toner when you can buy refilled cartridges at a fraction of the cost.
1,Terrible batteries. These do not last. They provide a very weak charge after only a couple of months. After that, your phones will die rapidly. I do not recommend.		Google Battery Manufacturer Hall of Shame and you will find EBL there.
1,Ummm... what happened to mechanical pencils???? I keep trying these things and it's always something. This one looked to be promising but it's missing the whole bottom of the pencil! You pull off the cap and all the lead falls out! What am I supposed to do with that!???  Now I have to go through drama returning it I guess. Totally disappointed.
1,Came with the packaging completely removed, with paper just floating around the box it came in (with other items as well), at least 1/3 of the paper is not usable. Real lame
1,Waste of money. These are too short to work. As they were meant for the babys room, I didn't want to try gluing them, given that the baby might chew on them.
1,I owned 2 of the predecessor product BJC 85 I think they are called and after having a printer repair person tinker with them they both actually do work again. This one seems much more character deficient electronically in that when there is clearly plenty of ink it starts sending messages to your computer that damage will occur if you do not change the ink cartridge. The old ones simply showed rather than threatening when they were out and that was much more satisfying and beleivable. Unfortunately for me the old ones are at my office which is over 1.25 hour drive away and now this one has flaked. It says the black ink is out but I just put a brand new brand (have never tried other) ink cartridge in and in fact was quite in disbelief at how fast it seemed to go through the last black ink cartridge. Now with the new ink cartridge it is not saying that the black ink is out for a change on the computer but it looks like the black ink is out all over the page...except that the top line and the bottom line are printing with full and normal black ink!!! I think it's too late to return to Amazon. So I'll be spending time on the phone with Canon or back to the printer repair guys. Both of the old BJC 85 printers worked for many years without any problem...just started when they had more time in hotter environment and not used as continuously...then that was fixed by changing the cartridge the ink tank goes in so disappointed in Canon that the new one has flaked so soon.
1,I have been using the Crayola pencils, which I have found to be very nice.  I got these on one of those "sale" things, and thought it would be great to get another set as the Crayolas are getting a little short due to usage.  These are much harder lead, one has to use a LOT of force to get most of the colors to work.  The colors are very waxy and often "skip" so you have a bit of blank space that no color will attach to because the wax took over.  Also, the paler colors (light yellow, yellow, tan, peach) had weird dark marks in them, which I finally realized was actually IN the lead, as my yellow had a blob of blue in it. After I realized it, I was able to sharpen the pencil and get the blue out of it, but not before my drawing was pretty much ruined. (It was as if when they mixed the batter, they didn't dissolve all the parts, like if you get a chunk of flour in your brownie...) Also, there are many, many shades of green, and very few shades of red.  Also, there are 2 white and 2 black pencils, so you don't even get 50 colors, just 48.  And who really needs a white pencil?  Especially if the others are so waxy, you can't draw over a previous color in order to shade....	At least they were on sale.
1,hey the dollar store has this in there for a dollar... the image makes you think it larger yeah right what a waste
1,dries out easily
1,After a month the "leather" started to wear at the corners like paper... I am going to have to replace it.
1,Worked well at first, but broke.
1,Very flimsy, doesnt cut evenly, you can do only 3-4 pages at a time.
1,I would have given this three stars, due to the font and tape limitations, but the fact that it can take up to 5 minutes to peel a lable, using it's useless built in tape peeling assistance "tool".  Best to use an exacto knife... just be careful if you are ill-informed enough to buy ANY Brother P-touch.  Prepare for ultimate frustration
1,Regular
1,The printer stopped working on the third use! Epson quickly replaced it with a newer model	Con: I had bought extra toner which are NOT compatible with the newer model!!
1,Buying this typewriter was a BIG mistake. A complete waste of money. I should have known better. Manual typewriters were never as we have come to expect with new technology, such as with electronic anything. But at least, I expected keys that move without being punched. Then when they do move, not sticking. Since buying this some time ago my only hope has been finding a local technician who could, perhaps, make it workable. As it is, it is no good to me. Just a reminder of the old adage, "Act in haste. Repent at leisure".
1,Resin separated from medium and you could see a glob of white floating back and forth.  Manufacturer asked for a picture of the product.  I sent one from y cell phone.  Manufacturer asked for a better picture.  I charged my camera sent sent a very clear picture of the white glob.  No response from seller, no gomenasai nothing.  No offer to replace.  Very unhappy when I went out of my way to help them understand what hapened to their product.  Ships from Japan so don't be in a rush.
1,If you're a teacher wanting to use these with expo markers, don't buy these!  Stick to Avery. This brand is fine with protecting the paper inside but the outside doesn't wipe down well. After one use, the kids can't use them again. They end up stained.  I was hoping for a cheap alternative to the Avery brand to allow my kids the ability to use Eureka templates again and again. No, this isn't going to work.
1,The Westcott Trimair 12-Inch Titanium Bonded Rotary Paper Trimmer is a fancy-looking paper trimmer that seems like it might offer an interesting trade-off between increased precision and reduced cutting capacity, but in actuality, it's a bad product. Traditionally, rotary paper trimmers are known for having very good precision but less cutting power compared to guillotine style ones, making them the better choice for scrapbooking or trimming photos instead of bulk cutting. Unfortunately for this Wescott Trimair Rotary Paper Trimmer, due to various design oversights and complete lack of operating instructions, the results it delivers are inconsistent and not always repeatable. Also, the long-term prospects of this trimmer look grim--the correct consumables (eg. replacement blades and cutting strips) were difficult to identify and aren't widely available, and I'm not confident that they will even be available in a year or two.		The major issues with this paper trimmer can be summarized as follows:	 1) There are no instructions for this product, either in the box or online. I had to look at the pictures on the box and play with the levers and such to figure out how to use this thing. So how do you use this thing? The levers move a bar up and down, and that bar is used to hold the paper you're trying to cut in place. It's critical that you engage the bar using both levers before cutting to ensure that the paper doesn't move mid-cut. Even in the up position, the bar doesnt go very high so you can only cut a few sheets of paper at a time, but that's fine since this is a Rotary trimmer. If your goal is to cut lots of paper, get a Guillotine style trimmer.	 2) The bar that holds the paper down doesn't have enough clamping pressure. It works well enough with thin paper, but it's not reliable when cutting multiple sheets of paper or cardstock.	 3) The blade only comes down when you press on the curved handle, which is a safety feature. Unfortunately, there's very little tactile feedback so it's difficult to know how hard to press. If you press too softly, you won't cut through the medium on the first pass and you'll need to do it again. If you press too hard, due to #2, you might get an uneven cut. Also, the height of the blade seems to affect the cut line so you will need to apply constant and consistent pressure to ensure straight cuts.	 4) The cutting line is not clearly marked, so you are either forced to  guesstimate your cuts or need to first measure the entire length of the thing you're cutting and then subtract using the ruler/grids. This is a major hassle since oftentimes, I know where I want to cut and I don't know or care about dimensions. Also, the grids and ruler don't seem to be of particularly good quality, so I'm not sure how accurate they are.	 5) Due to #2, 3, and 4, cuts are not always repeatable or predictable. Depending on how hard you push on the blade and depending on the direction you're moving the cutter and the kind of paper you're cutting, there could be a 1-2mm wide zone of uncertainty. This is evidenced in a few different ways: cutting a stack of paper from left to right and then moving the blade, in a cutting position, back to the left might result in more paper being cut. You can also see the uncertainty by examining the variable path of the blade across the cut strip, which is a strip of plastic that sits directly underneath the blade and provides added stability. My cut strip has multiple grooves in it, which means the blade has travelled across it in different positions.		Overall, I cannot recommend this product. It doesn't have the cutting capacity of a Guillotine cutter and it loses in terms of price and precision to my&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Scrapbooking-trimmer/dp/B0017KYE5Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Scrapbooking trimmer.</a>&nbsp;Factoring in the relatively high cost of the overly complex&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/replacement-blades/dp/B00DZHQU86/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">replacement blades</a>, this almost feels like a disposable paper trimmer.		Notes:	 1) Just in case you were wondering about the difference between a paper cutter and a paper trimmer, it seems that paper cutter and trimmer are generally interchangeable, with paper trimmer usually referring to lower-volume devices and paper cutter being applicable to everything.	 2) Official Replacement Blade Cartridge: Westcott TrimAir Titanium Bonded 45mm rotary replacement blade 15263	Official Cut Strip Replacement: Westcott Rotary Paper Trimmer Replacement Cutting Strips, 15269
1,Too flexible and lightweight.  The mat moves on my carpet, forcing me to reposition it constantly.
1,Pages started falling out during first use.  Didn't even get to put in my back pocket.
1,Knife is too long. You can cut yourself.
1,Problems with ability to detect ink cartridges.  Software for scanning is awful.  Difficult to set up and use.  Making the wifi connect was like trial and error for several hours.  Nothing was logical about set up with conflicts between machine and provided software packed with the machine.
1,This should be an easy item to design and machine but these rings are obviously super low end. Compared to similar products I have owned in the past, they are crudely machined and fit poorly through the small holes found in knives and other key chain items. If you are looking for a disposable item, this is fine but if your want a smooth operating key chain, keep looking.
1,Find another solution. Ruined a door.
1,I had no trouble with my Lexmark printer until a few days after I (properly) installed these cartridges. I started getting a printhead error message, and nothing I did could fix it. I ended up having to buy a new printhead, along with what are legitimate Lexmark ink cartridges. I suspect these were not. Spend the money and buy real cartridges from Office Depot, where they will at least refund your money.
1,I returned this and am not convinced it was a genuine Lami.  Not the quality of first one I bought at a pen store and the packaging was very different.
1,I got this so I could label my son's fabric bins for his toys. They don't last. The bins don't get wet, don't get washed, don't go through any extreme temps, yet the labels all fell off within a week or two. I feel like I wasted my money.
1,Expensive refills and it's kind of a pain in the butt. It's nice to have precut strips of tape right on your wrist, but it's finicky (I wasted a lot because it wouldn't cooperate) and then they're just WAY more expensive than plain tape.
1,It is too loud. It will shred multiple sheets of paper as long as all of the sheets are thin. It also does not do a very good job shredding credit cards or cds. I was still able to read the numbers for the front of the card as well as the security number on the back. On top of that, it is toooooo loud.
1,Just received my order and wow was it wrong. I ordered the 48x48 without lip and received a 46x60 with lip. I can sort of make it work though and it's not worth the massive hassle to send it back.		As for the product itself, disappointed. I was expecting a thicker, higher quality floor mat. This thing is very thin and I expect it'll be cracking and broken within 6-8 months. I've used one of this thin quality before and they don't last. My last one was very thick and lasted several years. In my opinion, this item is not worth the price.		Another odd item was that I ordered it from Amazon with Cleartex listed as the seller. It was shipped from Overstock.
1,This time clock worked great with the original ribbon.  We bought two of these time clocks and they have been solid performers.  Both time clocks ran out of ribbon at about the same time so we ordered replacement ribbons.  And they were the Pyramid brand ribbons.  Neither ribbon worked well - they printed so light we could hardly read it. So we returned those and bought two more. Same problem happened.		How can a time clock manufacturer make replacement ribbons that don't work?		Now we have to buy new time clocks and waste all that money.  We are a charity so this is not a good thing.
1,NOT NEW AS ADVERTISED!!! The 6470A black came separately. I'm still waiting for the colors. These were advertised as retail package in new, sealed condition. The box is opened and then taped shut. I don't know if this unit was partly used or is refurbished or is completely worn out. I am a computer reseller and ordered these to resell to a customer. I cannot sell it in this condition and must now take the time to process a return and pay freight to return something that is NOT as advertised. I am hoping that the color cartridges will be new. We'll see. I'm NOT IMPRESSED and cannot recommend this reseller, Blizzard LLC.
1,Pens are so bold, they leak. Not happy with them but not worth returning. I would not buy them again.
1,Typical epson product fades, bleeds, just doesn't work well.  I switched to canon and never looked back.
1,STICKY TAPE IS NOT ENOUGHT TO KEEP THIS PRODUCT ON ITEMS YOU NEED TO FIND.  GOOD CONCEPT BUT WILL NOT STICK...NO REASON TO WASTE MONEY...FIND A BETTER WAY TO ATTACH PRODUCT AND IT COULD BE A WINNER...AT THIS POINT DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY
1,Broker after 1 year
1,Great product. It's strong, well made and could probably hold up a TV twice the recommended size.  The screws at the bottom are a lot bigger than they look in the pic. I'd definitely recommend this again. I liked it because it went together quickly and the installation was very intuitive.		On the other hand:	AMAZON SENT ME ONE OF THE BEST PRODUCTS I'VE EVER PURCHASED PACKED IN A BOX COVERED IN BIRD FECES! I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY DID IT BUT THE PRODUCT THEY SENT TO ME WAS IN AN AMAZON BOX AND THE BOX THE PRODUCT WAS IN WAS COVERED IN BIRD FECES. I DON'T THINK AMAZON CARES ANYMORE.
1,Nice look and easy to use!!
1,doesnt actually print UPS labels, so...useless. We kept out Zebra!
1,Beware, if you're a Mac user, this no longer works with Snow Leopard. Technical Support at Fujitsu emailed me back and said, "The expected ETA is going to be the end of this year" for them to fix this! Yikes. A great product rendered useless....
1,Worked well for short time but displays eventually malfunction!!!:-(
1,Don't buy this, it's extremely thin, smells like cancer, and the "gel pad" on it is more like an air pocket of foul smelling death.  I would suggest you fork out an extra 8 bucks and buy a quality pad
1,Easy set-up.  Good price.  Light and pleasant to use - and love the innercom ability.	Ordered a fifth one to add to the set-up and that was easy and flawless to do.		Our problem with the phones is a constant buzzing noise in every call.  It is not	an interference problem - at least I don't think so.  No other things on during	some of the calls, but that buzz is still there.	I would try some other system in the future......		OK - after 3 months: bought another phone to add to the set - none of them are working properly after 3 months.  And during the three months, all of the phones had a faint buzzing sound, and all of them had a problem dropping sound when talking -- sounding like a very very bad cell phone connection......finally ended up with	a strange highpitched squeal, and totally hilarious sound from callers: they could understand us, but they sounded like Daffy Duck on steroids.	Don't waste you money on these!
1,Too many variations of green. Not vibrant colors.
1,I had ordered this chair mat on December 9, 2015 and received it a short time later.  It is now 9 months later, September 2016, and the mat is starting to crack and breaking up from the wheels of the computer chair.  My hope was that this mat would last much longer than 9 months. Years ago I purchased a mat a local store, and that one lasted a much longer period of time.
1,OK. Took too long to get. Did not fit that great. Next time I would pay a bit more. Have a bit of crackling now in both phones I used them in where i did not have this before. Disappointed. Would not buy these particular batteries from this site.
1,NOT an extra fine point nib! Writes much thicker than even a fine point!
1,Save your money, this product may as well be a sheet of cardboard. Fresh out of the package, the corners were chipped, the metallic side was ended, and the middle framing came completely off. It's flimsy and is of terrible quality. A complete rip off.
1,easy to fail when Laminating
1,Unfortunately the adhesive is not good.  The envelope seals but then reopens later.  We've got a couple of boxes left to use so we've been taping them closed.
1,The cartridge is part of a bulk package, i.e. not wrapped for individual sale.  It came in the standard high quality foil wrapper without any box. No issue with that if the cartridge performs satisfactorily. It did not. After a rocky start of flawed prints I got two or three acceptable pages out of it. After that, nada. It failed on a dozen pages in a row as a tried to print out a manual from one of my electronic toys.  :(  I could have reordered through another vendor on Amazon but I need to print right away.  I went to Walmart which had the best prices locally.
1,The pen's writing quality is mediocre.	The clip broke off and as a result, I lost the pen. So, I'm not planning to buy this again.
1,I have had 3 of these Visor Deluxes over the last 3 years and all I can say is I hope my new Sony lasts longer.  It sure works better than the Visor Deluxe. My advice, get a Palm or Sony.  Forget Handspring until the quality goes up>>>
1,Prints only 1000 pages at the most. Not buying any more. Still have few to use, then no more this brand. Only positive point is none of them leaked.
1,what a complete waste of money! i have had this product for about 2 weeks and the part that goes around the doorknob is deteriorating and tearing. I threw one away and i am using the second one which i believe will fail in a couple of weeks as well.
1,The colored pencils doesn't go on as smoothly as Prismacolor or as vibrant, but I still used it. You have to apply more force for some colors and it can be frustrating. The lead is very hard and creates a rough finish.		Next time, I will have to spend more to buy the Prismacolor.
1,Tiny tiny tiny
1,Complete streaking garbage.  Did not improve after several prints and cleaning.  My other new inks were fine right away.  Tossed it in the trash.
1,Great fine tip....every one of the markers were dry and couldn't be used.
1,I am surprised that so many people like this stapler. It works fine as a stapler but it is so loud that I could never take it to a meeting or class. It is so loud that it scares my dog everytime I use it. I can't wait to get rid of it!
1,After sitting in the printer, unused and idle, for more than 12 hours the first few pages printed are corrupted.  The ink doesn't flow properly after sitting unused.  The cartridges have to be "jump started" a waste of paper and resources.  Poor quality ink.
1,Having used several Targus products before, I bought the top of this pointer line (AMP09US).  I was shocked at the poor construction quality.  All of the plastic feels cheap (including the cheap plastic that looks like a rubberized underneath) to the point of having razor sharp edges all around.  The battery door, which you need to open and close twice for every use because that's the storage for the USB, feels like it will snap and break at any moment.  Compared to other lasers, this one is very weak, although it's visible enough for a room with 30-50 people.  Larger rooms, and you'd need a separate laser.  It just feels like something you'd get out of a bubble-gum machine, and I've had MUCH better quality from less expensive pointers (including other Targus).  I wish the Logitec had a mouse function...
1,This is too big. It is much bigger than I was expecting. I have to put my keyboard on top of it for it to fit on my desk. This is about 1cm thick, and I prefer the flat mouse pads.	The logo in the corner is rubbery and impacts the movement of the mouse if the mouse goes into that area. This is a design flaw that is easily avoided. I have a better Anker mouse pad with a printed logo.
1,There's not much positive to say about this phone.  The only thing I can think of is the price - if you get it on sale.  Would I buy it again if I was starting over?  NO WAY.		Here's what's wrong with this phone - after about 6 months of use (we have 8 phones & 4 lines).		1. Call privacy - actually I should say LACK of any privacy.  For a business phone, privacy should be the the default setting - or at the very least provide a way to set the phone up so that when a call is answered, someone else cannot cut into your conversation.  There is a "privacy" button, but you have to press that button for EVERY call you get or make to activate this "feature".		2. HALF Duplex intercom.  Half duplex is where only one person can talk on the intercom at a time (the line of communication goes ONE way).  You can carry on a conversation (sort of) because the phone will automatically switch "directions" to allow the one who is speaking to be heard by the other person.  However, this assumes that it is quiet in both locations.  One of our phones is in the warehouse area (think noisy), and intercom is impossible.  Unless the person in the office is SCREAMING, the phone always gives the mic priority on the warehouse phone since it's picking up the background noise and assuming they are "talking".  Look for an intercom that supports FULL DUPLEX operation.		3. Scenario:  A call comes in on line 1.  If two people pick the phone up within a second of each other, the phone is not fast enough to block the 2nd person from picking up the same line.  This a little different from the privacy feature above.  Just by picking up the phone, a new line will automatically be selected, but the phone is not fast enough to automatically "block" the 2nd person from answering the same call.  If there is more than a second or so between when the 1st person picks up the phone to answer, and the 2nd person picks it up to answer the same line, then the 2nd person will just get a free line.  This must just be an extremely slow processor on the phone (or poorly designed software).		4. The DEFAULT for speed buttons should be the number that is programmed in (not an intercom).  Using the speed buttons to dial intercom stations is perfectly fine, but at least give me the CHOICE, don't force me to press a line to access the speed dial first.		Basically if you have a home office and are only using one or two of these phones, then they're probably ok.  Never for actual business use though.
1,Big, Clunky, paper-jamming, ink guzzler.  I bought this printer to replace my canon pixma photo printer when it finally died after many years of use.  I liked the idea of printing poster sized (Super B) prints for my art classes.  The Epson does occasionally print Super B from the rear tray, but it jams 2 out of 3 times.  The color is a little murky compared to the Canon and the thing runs through ink so fast.  I find the user interface to be unintelligible and have yet to figure out how to run the scanner.  I'm disappointed with this printer.  I will say that getting it on the wireless network was really easy.  I wish it would stop jamming.
1,This looked like it included the tape. I is the dispensers only.
1,The leather is very thick. It doesn't close flat, and it sits in the pocket as if you are carrying a second wallet. Filling it with standard business cards is difficult because of the pocket design. There is so much friction that inserting one card without damaging it is very difficult. I forced three in and it made a squeaking noise.	I'll upload pictures.		ps, I like the 4-star review that says this business card holder is not good for holding business cards
1,I had planned to decorate this one and use it for recipes. But the lid is impossible to close, it never comes down quite right. It is also just a bit too large for the cards, allowing them to slide down and bow. I am using it to hold rolls of tape now, but it is such a pain in the neck to close. Glad I didn't spend much on this.
1,If you are a fan of soft feel retractable pens, you will probably like these ones. They work fine.		But have you tried their older cousin, the classic BiC Cristal Stics (and I mean *<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/classic/dp/B0010O094W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">classic</a>,* like 1959 classic)? They are cheap-looking, ultra-simple pens, so they may not have graced your hand if you (like me) thought that a pen needs to be "soft feel" or "rubber gripped" to be comfortable. But then you'd be (like I was) missing the genius of these pens.		The classic BiC's were designed exceptionally, like bizarrely well. And I don't mean in a quaint, historical way. In a modern way -- no, in a *timeless* way -- the classic BiC's adhere magnificently to principles of space, form, structure, density, and gravity. Because of their hexagonal shape, they require minimal plastic while also retaining a surprising strength (try snapping one), and the hexagonal grip points give the pens impressive writing stability. A tiny hole drilled in the barrel's body keeps the air pressure the same both inside and outside the pen. Gravity feeds the thick ink down a tube to a free-spinning ball bearing that was manufactured within a fraction of a micron of accuracy. The result is that when the pen is pressed against paper, the ink slides out cleanly and, well,... perfectly. It's not only one of the most inexpensive pens (less than $1.50 for a pack of 10), it's also probably the most efficient pen, with a single pen able to write over 100,000 words (or about 2 novels). Hopefully this helps you understand why, when describing the classic BiC's, I am comfortable using the word "masterpiece."		And hopefully this helps you understand why, in comparison, clunky and over-designed "soft feel" pens seem somewhat repulsive.		Sorry if I come off as a pen snob.
1,I had a Panasonic cordless set (I think it was theKX-TG4000 Series) for more than 10 years when the the bases for the remote handset starting dying.  Because it was cheaper I decided to just buy a new set.  Big mistake.  The menu system on the new one is much slower, the buttons on all the handsets are not very responsive and the menu itself is confusing.
1,Incredibly overpriced!!!!  Don't order.  You can get the entire pen for cheaper!
1,Very cheap quality - didn't look like it would make it from home to work. Returned and bought something else.
1,VERY disappointed - I received these and two of the three are BLACK the picture shows all blue - SIGH!
1,This item came damaged. It worked for a few shred & then stopped.. Returned!
1,I ordered two. One has a slight gap in the lower rings. You know what that means, I'm dissapointed ...so take your chances.
1,not like the photo...
1,Very poor design without thinking.	One layer plastic spine was too weak to hold papers	and it broke in a couple weeks.
1,Finish is rough, and there were splinters on the top edge in the front and back.  I'm not sure if it happened in shipping, though I doubt it, but I had to return it.
1,since 3/8/13 to 6/5/13 it was broken reel.that about 3 months short time. better way buy solid metal line than reel line..
1,This arrived and immediately upon opening the package,  there was a foul chemical smell.  I can't use this at all because of the smell.
1,This paper is only good for printing invitations or test pictures.  It feels flimsy and the pictures quality is poor.  It is like using good quality letter paper for pictures.  I have used other photo paper (Epson & Kodak) which have been far superior and would recommend if you want beautiful quality, long lasting pics.  Buy this only if you want a quick post card, invitation, cheap holiday pictures, etc.
1,large an expensive.  rent instead
1,Soon after buying this phone, I experienced lots of static and in 3 out of 4 calls, even when i am 6 feet from the base station, the person on the line hears static and the call drops saying it lost the link. Looking into the warranty. this phone should be avoided - it is a garbage. Too bad i did not return the phone during amazon return period.
1,10 yellow, 2 green. 0 red. 0 blue. 1 broken.	Going back to Amazon.
1,Only lasted just over a year.  I never let it run out of ink.  I seldom print anything and it was always turned off when not needed.  Printed perfectly for that year, then after printing a 2 page document with no problems, I suddenly got the B200 error.  Nothing I found online would fix it.  Can't even override the error to use the scanner.  Extremely frustrating.  Junking it and getting a laser printer to replace it.
1,I really like brother laser printers and have several. In fact I returned this design-flawed unit and replaced it with another Brother, so the following review isn't spiteful.		I've read several reviews of this brother HL5470W blowing circuit breakers. But, I'll go one better. When we plugged in this little monster and turned it on it blew out our surge protector. Destroyed the thing not just tripped it. I actually think it did that because my whole house is wired with 20-amp circuits and it just burned out the weakest link. After speaking with Brother tech support, it appears that this particular model has an unusually high start-up amperage compared with all their other fine products. It shouldn't be on the market.
1,I never could get the fax to work.
1,Great when I first got it. all the jewels fell off after a few weeks.so sorry I bought it. waste of money.
1,I don't like the colors, there's not enough difference in the colors in the same range.
1,I purchased this for my husband....he cant figure out how to get the functions to work...directions are awful.  He destroyed the oriiginal package so now I can't return it.....  )-:
1,does not stick - waste of money
1,I found these pens to be very disappointing as they are not like any gel pens I have:  it takes them 10-12 minutes to dry and they are just flat when they do. There was no souffle effect nor were the colours anything special, not as brilliant as regular gels nor as artistic as coloured pencils. I bought them because I needed a pastel assortment for coloring. I think they will be fine for accents, but the violet pen made a pansy look like a blob: I had to use a Micron pen to go back in and restore the lines on the flower to give it any depth. I paid full price for my set, so the reduced price on Amazon is more in line with their value.

I haven't noticed any glare from lights when I'm writing on it, but there was a glare I was filming.  It's a matter of preference, but if you want something that is clear, then the Duraglas is not for you.  Also, the material isn't very classy.
1,Maybe should have read the reviews better - but I didn't like the marketing of this ruler.	It seemed like you're going to receive all four of them - YOU DON'T!!!	You don't get to pick your color.	And I'd highly recommend that Amazon should reexamine this page - it is misleading.	My ruler came all scratched and marred.	Do Not Recommend this Product.
1,this is a cute, pretty dispenser BUT it will not hold a new tape roll.  I had to roll a lot of the tape off to make it fit into the holder.
1,I wanted to scan to scan photos to Dropbox and documents to Google Docs without being connected to my computer.  This seemed like it would be a solid choice.		I started by installing the software the manual tells you to install.  It opens a half dozen windows, only one of which actually lets you go forwards in the installation process.  It also somehow tried to install itself twice on my computer.  There is no indication of how far along you are or even what it is doing sometimes.  Once you make it through this Kafkaesque nightmare, its not clear how to make it work with any cloud accounts.  I selected Scan to Google Drive in the software.  It didn't ask for any credentials, so how is this going to work?  The answer was it doesn't, it asked me for credentials later.  Why not set it up during the setup process?		Everything is its own app, which is not how any other Mac software works.  Scan to Google Drive?  Open a new application.  Need help?  Open a new application.  Google drive support is useless, you cant scan to a specific folder, and it has to be connected to your computer for it to work.  The application does not seem to support DropBox at all.  So, I googled this.  Apparently, there is yet another program not mentioned in any of the guides called SnapScan Cloud that you need to configure to do this.		I downloaded it from the App Store.  Have to go through the dance with the USB cable again to configure the WiFi, which I had already configured previously.  Need to create a special account with Fujitsu now.  To scan something with the scanner I bought.  I feel like we are getting to the point where I will need an account with my toaster to make toast in the morning.  Oh, and look, Fujitsu has some password policy straight of the 1990s, probably created by the same programmers that wrote their software.  I create a less secure password to fit within their policy.		I finally get it setup to send Photos to dropbox, and documents to Google Drive.  I scan a few hundred photos.  About half of them are scanned as PDFs, and sent to Google Drive.  No idea why, all of my photos were the same size, and are standard photos.  There appears to be no way to force the scanner to scan something as a photo.		Incredibly poor functionality for a device that costs this much money.
1,I ordered the "10 Pack Large Print Low Vision Checkbook Registers" before Christmas and was absolutely thrilled with them.  My mother who has macular degeneration was able to write down her check info without assistance.  However, I placed a second order in January (by using the re-order the same product through my Amazon account and even verifiying the info prior to the order) and was thoroughly disappointed when I received the second order. They are NOT the same check registers and I could easily get the same thing from my local bank at no cost.  The lines are narrow and do not even resemble my first order or what is pictured.  It is too much trouble to send them back but I will not order again as I don't want to pay for something I could get for free at the bank!
1,I really wanted to love this pen, as I wanted to use it for taking notes while watching films (I'm an online film critic) in (obviously) very dark rooms. When I received the pens yesterday,  I immediately tried one in my living room with all the lights out and the LED was so incredibly bright that I immediately got a headache. It's just way too bright. If I dared to use this at the cinema I would be beat up by all the other people there. No way can I use this for what I intended, and what I thought was one of the possible uses of it. Another downside is you have to click three times (loud clicks) to turn on the light and then one more loud click to turn it off. This means I'd be click-click-clicking throughout the entire film, further annoying everyone in the cinema. I could've put some opaque tape on it or some over "hack" to tackle the brightness issue but I don't have time for that. Otherwise it's a very nice product, and it looks sturdy enough. Sorry, but it's going back today.
1,Worst print quality of any printer I have ever bought and I have bought at least 15.  It will Not print card stock, ledger size as it claims.  I bought it to print out labels which it will not do so hopefully I can return it to Amazon.  The picture shows the labels I printed on the left with this printer, the label on the right is my old HP printer.		eta: Yes, returning to Amazon, why I know I can buy with confidence.
1,Used this to mount a plastic medium size command hook on an outside stucco wall to hang a damp towel after drying dogs' paws.  Stayed up well for a few days.		Then came the rain -- although the wall is protected by our roof eaves, so rain wasn't getting directly onto the hook. I hung a second towel on the same hook. Soon after that, it all fell down.  Tape is rated for 15 lbs. I used about 1-1/2" of tape on the hook and 2 towels combined couldn't have been much more than 3 lbs.		Will try again, making sure to only hang 1 towel on the hook.  I want to mount so many command hooks on our stucco wall (for wet towels, to hang our shoes) that I'm really hoping the tape works out.
1,My printer does not print the same with these ink cartridges in it.  It seems as though the wrong color was placed in the cartridge.  It has not been worth the savings.
1,Item description stated was a 10 realm case, and only received one realm.
1,:)
1,One word: flimsy.
1,Its okay
1,This is not well weighted at the base.  When you pull a sticky note out of the container in an upward motion, the container rises up off the desk.  Very annoying.
1,I've used Canon inkjets for a long time and have sold many to my clients.  I have liked them because they work well, are cheap, and can use ultra-cheap non-OEM ink tanks.		Lately I've started having them die on me.  One stopped printing in color; another stopped printing at all.  Both were software or hardware failures, not a clogged printhead or anything like that.  There was no help from Canon, and nothing to do but to just replace the printers.		Today I tried using the scanner on my new MX922.  It turns out that the MP Navigator EX program that has come with Canon multifunctions forever does not work with the MX922.  They supplied a VERY basic scan utility that is a royal pain to use.  Why?  I have no idea.		It sounds like it's time to find a new vendor for inkjet multifunctions.  Canon has fallen far.		-jimc
1,This was the first time for buying the Aluminum push-pins and it will probably be the last.  The reason is that the tack's finish comes off on your fingers leaving them dirty.  Other than that, they function like any other push-pin.  Because of this negative quality of the pins getting your fingers dirty, I would recommend sticking with plastic push-pins; they are cleaner to use and they are cheaper!
1,ok
1,Nothing more to say then it is very cheap
1,These didn't work for my HP printer :(
1,Doesn't come with ink.  Ink is almost impossible to find.
1,This stuff stinks! It smells flammable, I can't use it for what I planned.
1,I ordered a bunch of sheets in this color, and only received 1, after paying 20x I would have if I went to any craft store if I bought it at regular price.
1,Made well but the ink does not flow.  Some times it works, but most of the time not.
1,Don't stay on good. 2nd wash came off
1,These tore up very quickly.  They are not made of a durable plastic like the others are.  They ripped out the holes, so it wouldn't stay in the binder rings.  It looked like these would expand better than some of the other brands, but I did not find it to be the case.  I had to replace these within a month.
1,This is way too small for my car key. It's only 3x2x0.5 inches.
1,Great color, but grip is not as good as the plastic version which I have used/loved for years.
1,I use my Palm V as an address book, calendar and to-do list, with a few digital notes. I also have the Dooney & Bourke Palm V Case and the Palm travel kit.	The Palm V is sleek and attractive, but has a few major flaws:	1. The on button is not protected from being constantly activated by the case, causing the batteries to drain extremely fast.	2. The flimsy cover that it comes with is not sufficient. Everybody that I know that has a palm, bought an additional case. The original case should at least be usable.	3. The reset button does not clear memory, forcing me to wait for the batteries to die to clear it. No bulk delete option is provided.	4. There is no USB option provided with the basic Palm for synching with USB devices.	5. The rechargeable built-in battery is nice if you don't leave your cradle for more than a week, but nasty if you travel.	In short, the Palm V has potential, but some simple design flaws and the need to buy a number of add-ons just to make it functional are simply unacceptable at that price tag.	For my needs, I'm going to the REX 6000. It is far less expensive, much more portable, and provides both USB and PCMCIA synching out of the box.
1,OK I suppose, kinda cheap.
1,Neat idea, bad execution. The tabs are simply paper, not thick at all, so they curl up if you try to use them to mark a page etc. The adhesive is on a very small strip along the bottom, so using these on file folder tabs isn't great either because they just curl up and you can't see/read them. Neat little case though.
1,The printer works great!  However, prior to purchasing it, I had been buying remanufactured ink from LD Products/4Inkjets for Hewlett Packard printers for many years.  Lexmark designed the Prevail Pro705 to reject remanufactured ink.  It damages the printhead, disables printing, and voids the warranty.  A set of Lexmark printer cartridges costs more than I paid for the printer, and the ink does not last long enough.  I traded the printer in on a HP printer, and remanufactured ink works fine in it.
1,Purchased this to go in my home recording studio, where I just installed shiny new bamboo flooring.  Right off, I tried removing the large product sticker in the upper left, but a ton of adhesive was used to put the sticker on.  So I applied (foolishly) some goo-off, which promptly ate through the white plastic.  I tried sanding it down to remove the damage, only making it worse.  After mucking around with this mat for half an hour I lost my temper, folded it in half, and shoved it in the garbage, as it wasn't going to be worth the effort and expense to repackage it and ship it back.
1,Material is lighter weight than my previous box, doesn't seem to laminate as well. Several pieces came apart while I was traveling resulting in loss of documents. I may try increasing the heat but you'd think it would be just the opposite.
1,I'm a teacher and I use different colors to Leo my student differentiate the notes. These markers write very lite and don't show up well on a white board.
1,This is a strange color. It is not red, not copper. Not pink, but way closer to pink than red. It is metallic, tho. They got that part right.
1,This binder is useless.  The d rings do not stay closed making it impossible to use this as a binder.  I recommend you do not purchase this binder.
1,Several reasons for 2 star, it did fit well into the slot, something I couldn't find at any local store, so I gave points for that.	Took away points for the fact it took over 3 weeks to get here, it was not portrayed as coming from overseas, so I thought I'd get this item in a reasonable time, did not!, another low score is for a crack (defect) in the wheel, noticed that when I took it out the package,	similar reason the original may have failed, maybe same place that made the chair or parts thereof. So next time I may kluge my	own vs. waiting a month for another defective one. Do not recommend, and check your source to see where it's coming from.
1,Updating my review.... Using this for a few external hard drives, not good quality. One of the ends cracked and broke off.
1,The sound is clear.  I love the different ringtone choices.  The handset design is easy to hold and your ear automatically goes to the the speaker.  I know that may sound strange but the phones I replaced were flat and half the time I had to reposition the handset to hear.	 One button gets you to your list of saved phone numbers which is very convenient.  The only thing I don't like about the phones is the caller id voice.  It doesn't sound out the last letter when it announces the call.. so when my son Greg calls it sounds like Grah.. I'm getting used it to though.  Overall, I like the phones and am glad I purchased them.		oh, I forgot to say I loved the call block feature.  It's very easy to use.  Everything about this phone is pretty much dummy proof.		update..  couldn't find replacement batteries so called Panasonic.  This item was from 2007..  couldn't even get a single phone because model is discontinued.  Buyer beware..
1,This is not 75lb weight. The paper is also has streaks. Poor quality.
1,These are not what I expected for the price, the material that it is made of is flimsy.
1,Horrible quality. Just order the real thing. Didn't last very long.
1,Love the lamination! Scotch is the best and they know it cause they charge too much. It's not worth twenty words in a review. If you can find it cheaper somewhere, let me know.
1,cheaply made, broke after a few weeks
1,failed after little use just a couple of years.  Not printing correctly using color that requires darkening.	Toner and drums cost a fortune to replace.  bulky to move...
1,Bought this for our Epson printers. We do a lot of printing, but it's mostly just documents, not fine art prints, so we thought we could get away with cheaper ink. They worked fine for a few weeks, but then we started noticing striping, and the black was coming out more like a dark grey. Did some nozzle checks, head cleanings, realignment... nothing seemed to fix the problem for more than a day (sometimes only a few hours). Finally, it completely clogged our Epson Workforce 2630. This is a big problem because Epson printers are one of the only ones that you cannot easily access/clean/change the nozzle head, making the printer essentially useless. Luckily it was still under warranty, so we switched it out. Our remaining printers are still producing awful striped prints, but haven't clogged. We will not be purchasing this ink again, and will be sticking to Epson inks from now on.
1,I've used the Parker Jotter Pen since 1970.  I have several that I acquired over the years. Over the past 10-15 years, it's become more difficult to find the pen.  I now have to purchase "replacement" over the internet.  Over the past year it's become impossible for me to purchase the ink Re-fills from a "brick and mortar" store.  I checked with Amazon a found the one type of Parker Re-fill I use, medium point, black ink.  They are sold in a 6 Pak Set, which is fine by me.  I have ink for the foreseeable future.		After I've used several of the ink re-fills, I've discovered that there is only a half load of ink in the re-fills.  The re-fill is difficult to get the ink flowing with each use. (Have a "scratch pad" that you can run the pen back and forth to start the ink flowing).  Half the ink you will use of this deminished re-load will be to just getting the pen to write.  If you can find Parker reloads else where, buy them there.
1,So we never use it!  Combos should always be user-controlled.  It's also very tiny - not suitable for a set of keys, for instance.
1,Not very soft for some reason. I've bought the same thing in two other colors and they were much much softer.
1,doesn't work well at all. have to take it out an shake it every once in awhile to get it to print well.
1,This brand sucks.  I was supposed to get a refund and I didn't.  I forgot that I had tried it some years before and it didn't work then.  You are better off getting, on the cheap, the Staples off brand based on the Liquid Paper brand.  MUCH better.  I am still waiting for my refund, Amazon.
1,THEY DO NOT WORK. HP has found ways to make everyhting fail. That said, The ink quality is fine and I will never buy another Hewlet printer.
1,I purchased this  unit August 2013, the handle to remove the motor broke off  within the first 2 weeks, very weak handle poorly arttached to the motor unit.  Without this handle it is very difficult  to remove the cutter motor from the basket as it is very heavy.  The unit performs well otherwise.
1,I cannot for the life of me figure out how to get my printer adjusted enough to get these to print correctly and when I finally did, the ink smeared all over the printer surface which made the label illegible.
1,I bought four of these staplers (model 665) for my classroom.  Two broke the first day they were used.  They might have successfully stapled 20 times each before they broke and couldn't be fixed.  The silver metal part got stuck inside the black metal part and there was no way to unjam either one.		Soon after that, the third stapler broke.  The plastic "button" on the back of the staplers was cheap and fragile and couldn't hold up to students' use. Then the metal "posts" that hold the two part of the staplers together fell out.		Within about four-to-six weeks of purchase, all four had broken.  They jammed, the metal posts fell out, the spring fell out... the staplers just all fell apart.  Completely.		These staplers are NOT "Swingline quality" AT ALL.
1,The color and style of this padfolio are very nice. However, the front snap broke within 2 hours of me using it; so I have to give it 1 star from a quality standpoint.
1,Some large documents went through cartridge, but not the life expected for the price. Poloroid has a history of disappointment since 1995.
1,I have been ordering this ink from Amazon whenever I run out and have never had an issue until now. I paid extra for one day shipping. The ink came in an envelope this time and with a note stating that they were being environmentally friendly by not shipping in the usual box packaging. When I inserted the black cartridge, the printer kept saying it was an error. I tried several times to re-install, even unplugged the printer to clear out the memory, but I still kept getting "left cartridge error". I am not sure if this is a bad batch or some fakes that the shipper got for cheap. I have to go through the hassle of returning the product and am hesitant to order the ink through Amazon. What if I get another bad cartridge? Do I have to go through the hassle of shipping it back again. I have several projects due for school and I can't have another incidence like this.
1,This phone says wall mountable ... well you can but the receiver DOES NOT HANG ON,IT FALLS OFF!!! Very short cord.  will give away.
1,Worked fine through it's initial set of toners, died 2 years from date of purchase with minimal use just by sitting there. Would not power up anymore.	Great buy if you get it for < $100 and use it JUST with the initial set of toner. Don't bother buying more toner for it, you won't get to use them.	Color quality was decent, had to lighten ALL photo material on screen before printing, otherwise all prints came out too dark.
1,You certainly get what you pay for.
1,When I used the highlighter on a basic piece of printer paper, it erased perfectly - although I used it on a blank spot. Sure as I was that the product would work great, I went to work in my brand new text book. I made a mistake, well, I can erase it! Instead, I nearly erased right through the page and it took of most of the words and what was left was smeared (glossy paged text book). I had to find a fine point ink pen to re-write what I had just erased. Beware if using on text books. I won't be buying again.
