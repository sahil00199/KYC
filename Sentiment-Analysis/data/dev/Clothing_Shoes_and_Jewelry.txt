0,The polarized black shades are absolutely dark and I have no glare from the sun.  I would definitely buy these glasses again.
0,Purchased for my husband.  He was very pleased with the fit.  They had a chemical odor to them but aired out and now they are fine.
0,Great scrubs! Love this brand. Cute color. Looks flattering on anyone. Most of the Med Couture now runs slightly larger but will form forum to your body after a few washes.
0,If you are looking for a nude pump, I highly recommend this one.  I had been eyeing up this pair and tried them on in-store to get my size right.  The heel isn't too high, which means you will last the night without feeling like you can't take another step in your heels.  They literally go with everything, from jeans to dress pants.  I love them and think I'll end up getting the black patent pumps if I see them on sale.  I love the round toe and classic shape.  One of those pairs that you will always just go to when choosing footwear on a night out.		Every girl needs a pair of nude pumps in her closet!
0,Best athletic and all day sock I have ever worn.
0,Nice shoes, seem to fit comfortably and my toddler loves them.  The did seem to fit slightly big, which wasn't a problem b/c at times it was cold at daycare, so she wore socks with them as well.
0,Doesn't look cheap, good stitching, fits comfortably and stays in place, color matches the advertisement.  Only concern is wishing the zipper seemed more sturdy due to my larger body size.
0,daughter loved them...
0,I am an experienced hiker, 6 feet 225 pounds size 12 shoe with flat feet. Over the years I've tried several brands of boots, some costing easily twice as much as these. I am on my third pair and I will only buy this boot from now on. My last pair got over 1,000 miles on them but now I use them for lawn duty. I highly recommend this boot. No breaking in required. I just lace them up and go!
0,Perfect
0,I got lots of compliments on this corset but it does run small. Go up 2-3 sizes from what you normally wear.
0,I love these sandals.  They look great with denim or dressed up.
0,Best ever!
0,Beautiful watch! My husband has a large collection of Invicta watches and all have been purchased from Amazon. This is definitely one of my favorites. The quality is amazing and for the price you can not go wrong. Very happy Amazon Prime customer!
0,For those who say they have a hard time putting on with the straps crossed in back.... I think it's not hard once you figure out the process. You first put your head through the middle and then your arms through the holes. Then hook the back! I like the support of this bra and it does provide nice shape. I first thought it would give me a uni-boob - but it really doesn't do that. Loved the other Natori Yogi Bra and like this one as well!!
0,I'm 53, 132lbs, It is fit to wear aloneWear it on the outside of the compressed down jacket is a little small
0,Looks good on my charm bracelet. Exactly as described.
0,These are great in cooler weather.  Quality fabric and design.
0,Great outfit for my little boy. Quality is good, not cheap looking
0,Really pretty.
0,Delivered today , had hubby try them on right away...they fit perfect to size ordered and he says they are comfortable. Likes the style too, and easy on/off shoe type.
0,This was my first experience with that seller - I bought this dress as a gift for my daughter. Frankly speaking - no issues - came earlier than expected, size fits as expected, made with material in good quality, nice colors. My daughter is very glad and dresses it very often in school. I can fully recommend this seller.  Regards
0,Great sturdy belt. It fits thru standard jean loops (which can sometimes be a problem. Looks good with jeans and a tshirts and with more dressy attire!! I will buy a second one when I need too!! Great belt
0,Looks and fits great
0,Best shoes I've bought.
0,Love them.  Was afraid the straps would gape on my foot, but they fit perfectly.  Very versitile with the shades of green used in the straps.  Great value!
0,These work great when you have a tight shirt to wear and do not want the bulk of the belt buckle sticking out from under our shirt adding bulk to your waistline.
0,It's very warm and my husband looks handsome in it
0,I am a wedge and 2.5" heel fan so this boots are so perfect for me.  I always allow one size up for boots and sneakers to allow for socks in cold weather but they do not come in half sizes.  I am a size 7 so I ordered 8 but returned it, too big even with thick socks.  This time I ordered 7, it's a narrow path even with regular thin socks I thought it wouldn't work but I pushed in and it fits snuggly but would be tight if socks are any thicker.  Overall great looking for classy or casual.  I have medium feet, I'd give it 5 stars if they made it a tad roomier.
0,Really loved this little onsie...my husband and I cant wait to put it on our little one and the quality of the fabric is great
0,warm and comfortable. well made and looks great. i hand wash and line dry and its plenty durable.
0,How much fun is this poncho?! I love animal prints, and this one is great. I always get compliments when I wear it! This is a cozy, soft, fun accessory.
0,Quick delivery. Good quality and construction. No problems works great! Buy one :-)
0,Very good quality
0,Was for my daughter  she love this
0,great little bag during travel,it was easy to carry around my documents,passport etc,would recommend it to anyone
0,I usually need to purchase swimwear tops and bottoms separately as I'm larger on top.  The bottoms fit really well and are super comfy.  The top, as expected, is too small.  However, if the pads were removable I would be able to use the top as well.  Removable pads are also great for washing, this is the only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5.  (I'm 5'4", 110 lbs, 36" bust, 24" waist, 34" hips and ordered the small)
0,Beautiful! My best friend loved it. It's pretty heavy but it looks great.
0,Great crop top. I wear off the shoulders but works both ways. Not as low cut as it appears
0,People compliment me in these pants AND they're comfortable. Enough said.
0,I love these capris. I really like the elastic in the waist. Everything else I have tried on is too tight. I am petite and it is so hard to find the right clothes that fit and are comfortable. All these other ones I see are for super thin people I hardly see any models here that have a little meat on their bones. These are nice and casual. Why do they have to put the tags through the clothing in which they make little holes in the material that somehow become bigger holes and destroys the material. I don't like that.
0,I love these boots - I'm a size 5 and these fit perfect.  They are very comfortable and can be worn folded with faux fur showing all all the way up to the knee.  I always get compliments on these.
0,If you like cheeky & overall smaller bikini, youll like this one
0,LOVE this Baja. Love the fact that it is fleece lined and is ZIP UP!!! Awesome deal for the price.
0,Great coat wonderful
0,Got this for my grand daughter to wear with her long gown for her baptism.  She is a tall 4 year old and this fit her perfect with the white gown.
0,Great 993, classic U.S quality. you will never regret for this buy. Bought at the price of $120, just fantastic
0,They are great for working outside in the snow. I bought two pairs, one for me and one for my daughter. They are very warm. The fit is about right, if not a bit snug if you have on good socks with them. I wouldn't recommend wearing them all day, as your feet will get warm. There's not much support in them, but that's not why you buy boots like these anyways. I haven't had them long enough to account for durability but they seem solid. I would buy again.
0,Comfy and just the right amount of warm.  They have some problems staying up, but overall are a great product!
0,This is my second pair. Love these overalls. Well made and very comfortable.
0,Fits me perfect
0,Well made shirt
0,These shoes r very comfortable. I am on my feet all day for wrk on concrete floors,  and these have definitely eased some of my foot pain.	The only issue I have is that I use custom made shoe inserts from my Dr, & even with taking the original soles out of these shoes, it raises my foot a little higher to the top so I have to loosen the laces a lot so it doesn't hurt so much. Otherwise, these shoes r really comfy for standing and walking.
0,Very comfortable and easy to get on and off. Running in and out in muddy weathr with a dog made tie shoes a bit of a pain. These are convenient and feel sturdy and safe for wet weather.
0,VERY NICE WORK PANTS., FIT IS PERFICT.
0,I LOVE these shoes!
0,This little necklace is lovely.  I have gotten lots of compliments.  It is very dainty and feminine.  It came really quickly also.
0,They feel a little wide. But all in all, are very comfy and lightweight.
0,Comfortable. Great for running and relaxing.
0,I'm happy
0,It matches my robin blue color turquoise perfectly!  The stretch band is not too tight so it does not allow gaps in between the stones.  I have a large wrist and it fit great.  Howlite beads match great with turquoise rings.  I truly enjoy the look without the high cost.
0,Very nice belt with simple plain buckle.
0,Kenneth Cole REACTION Women's How Low Loafer. Dalmation.	These are wild, and its nice to wear such a statement shoe. They	look good and are extremely comfortable. Highly recommend
0,Not bad, get what you pay for. Nice little watch.
0,Great boots for my daughter whose feet were always freezing. My daughter has them in a smaller size, worn them 2.5 years and now starting to split a rear seam at the same time becoming decidedly too small in the toes.  I gambled that by  going up a size we could get another year or two...but if they made these lavender ones in women's I would have gone for that instead. Honestly, the women's sizes in this style are really boring colors.
0,Amazing quality for such a reasonable price. I bought the royal in size 8 and have found it to be too roomy. I usually wear a size 8-10 in jeans. Size down and down again for a snug fit. Received the size 6 and fits perfectly!
0,I love the design.
0,LOVE these jeans.  They fit true to size and are super comfortable.
0,I bought a plastic one before this and it was pure junk. This worked great, did the trick, and was a great price. I was using it on some very wide band Invictas.
0,Just didn't like.
0,My toes look so pretty all dressed up with these Paparazzi flip flops!  My heels are jealous.
0,I have only worn these shoes once, and I fully expect them to stretch (reasonably) to fit my particular foot. I already own another pair from the same brand that did just that and they soon became the most comfortable shoes I owned.		I plan on continuing to wear these to 8-hr work days and will update this review if they prove to continue to be uncomfortable.
0,I thought it was a really nice Jacket. Well made fit nice.  Fast shipper
0,I order one pair a year. A little tight at first, I just wear them around the house initially. I love the cork heel.  They are easy to walk in and stable. I receive compliments on them all the time, they are very cute.
0,Great sneak my son loves them
0,For the little bit of OCD in us all.		My wife is always giving me a hard time about having to pack this or that whenever we go anywhere, and I'm hoping these will make things a little easier for all of us.		My personal packing style is to wait for the very last minute and then scoop up everything from one or two drawers and shove the contents into a duffel. My wife is WAY more organized. But wait 'til she sees me next time. Socks and underwear together. T-shirts together in another bag. A separate bag for dirty laundry for the trip home.		I got these in blue, and I will use them this weekend. I'll update this review when I get back.		Note: Sample provided for review.
0,BRCbead bracelets seem to have much stronger threads than these. The beads themselves are very pretty with great color. But Im headed back to BRCbead bracelets when they have more stone options. Bought this when they didn't have pink.  This brand definitely is a good buy, but again lost a star for lighter threading.
0,I LOVED THE HAT BUT IT WAS TO SMALL FOR FRIENDS HEAD THIS HAT IS THE BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!!
0,Soft with bright colors. Perfect for those late night diaper changes. Fold over mitten options on the sleeves.
0,Shirts fit as expected and do as claimed... keep my body dry. These shirts are very comfortable and easy to clean. I plan to buy more.
0,beautiful and classy.  This color surprisingly can be worn with any color.  I get tons of compliments on these and will buy more for summer!
0,it fit but was small across the shoulders but fit
0,You want to get a half size smaller than your dress shoe size. I wear 11.5 for dress shoes and i got these in 11 and they fit perfectly.
0,I received this yesterday and it is adorable. It is super tiny and delicate. The ring is about the size of a dime and the gold is the exact same color of gold shown in the photo. It is not a bright gold. It looks more vintage. It is a cute little necklace that is perfect for Coachella or just wearing out at night. It is very simply styled.		I received this item in exchange for an honest review.
0,Love the shorts. Look and fit great. Well made and for a great price.
0,Love these things for my running shoes and triathlon shoes. In fact I have bought more to put on other athletic shoes.
0,I really like th thanks you very much and have a bless day.
0,sandals feel great but wish they had alittle more arch support
0,I am a large man (350 +lbs) and I also carry around a EDC bag and this thing is great!  It comes in a netted pouch and unfolds to a very large poncho that covers me really well and still have enough room to cover my bag. this will be perfect when i'm out riding my bike trying to get in shape and it starts raining. when I get to my destination hang it up let it dry and fold it back up in the pouch and toss it in my bag for next time use.
0,it took about 2 weeks to arrive, which was a bit earlier than the delivery estimate said it would!	it's so cute and the shades are very dark. (i got a black pair)	will have to purchase another pair in red!
0,The color and print are both fantastic  seems really high quality. The proportions of the shirt, however, are almost comedic. The sleeves are super big and long. Thankfully my daughter is too in love with the print to care about the fit.
0,Good comfortable shorts.
0,When I first ordered these almost a year ago for my husband, I bought 2 other brands. as well.  When he saw these, he did comment on the skull on the back as a negative.  However, since then, these shirts are the ones he wants to wear over the others.  He just had me buy 6 more!
0,awesome deal, i got my pair only 10$
0,Perfect school uniform dress! Does not have a "skort" built in, so it makes for easy access to the potty for my transitional kindergartner.
0,Size 10 is actually a size 10! It's like walking on air and they come in really cool color combinations.
0,After ankle reconstruction surgery, I've only worn Asics. It's the only shoe that provides the needed support.
0,It's very nice I just wish it was a little bigger...
0,This is great for outdoor exercising during colder weather. It really keeps me warm and I'm very happy it has a place to put my pony tail through. Normally I would have to keep my hair down in order to wear a toboggan and it was a pain having my hair down on my neck.  It keeps my ears nice and toasty also. I would highly recommend this for anyone with med or long hair who walks/runs outside in cold weather. We cant let the cold stop us from exercising and keep us from better health. =)
0,I had purchased a pair months ago and they were too big. It was hard to tell at first. I highly recommend doing your best to get the proper fit. And when they seem to be a bit big, within a week they will be a mess. But I bought another pair that fit just right. They are comfortable, warm, and they will get at the very least a big smile from the most serious person. I'm 61 and having fun with them.
0,Couldn't have been the Joker without it.
0,These are awesome!  I was almost too warm sometimes!  These fit comfy like pajamas, and the top is thick enough that if I had to peel back the layers and just wear it alone when inside, it passed for a long-sleeve tee.
0,Great style for the price.  fit is true to size.  But be sure to check the pics.  the toes are narrow.  They fit me, but since I have chubby feet, I don't have space to spread out toes.  Once on, they look super high, but they don't feel that way.  The straps are elastic but not wrapping or marking ankles at all.  I thought is was a very nice addition to my wardrobe.
0,These are really good quality, the rubber seems sturdy, but flexible, so my kiddo can run and jump and climb comfortably with no hassle of having to break them in.		Also, although the photos on the sale page only show these being worn by a girl, I can attest to the fact that they are quite gender neutral. They look great on my son, and he calls them his moon boots!
0,I bought three. Different colors. Very light, great for hot days. Outstanding value.
0,This is my first pair of ankle socks that i purchased and I really like them. They fit well and they do not shrink. Would recommend.
0,My son loves these pjs.
0,Adorable on my grandson.  He is not quite a year, (on the smaller weight size) and can wear the 6-12 month size nicely :)
0,Great shoes....
0,They are as comfortable as they are ugly.
0,Love pediped shoes. They have a nice grip to the bottom of them but yet are still flexible for beginning walkers. Themy seem to be well constructed and look great. My 11 month old is able to comfortably walk in them. At 11 months her feet are 4 1/4 inches and the size 0 to 6 months is starting to get snug.
0,I love it
0,They look so cute on my daughter! Love them. They fit well and as expected.
0,I love these enough to hope they stretch out. They are very narrow through the front of the foot area, and my heel extends a bit off the end. Very cute sandals though.
0,Love them
0,Nice leather, well made, looks like picture.
0,Love this shirt. Get compliments on it everytime I wear it.
0,Cute top. It's a thicker material, not like a standard thin fabric shirt. I'm usually a large and after seeing the size chart I ordered a large, but it fits a little snug. It still kinda fits, but it's tighter around the waist and hips. If you're looking for a looser look, like the model in the pic, then probably order a size up. It is great quality. I may order more colors but in a larger size.
0,Very SEXY....loved this dress.
0,I love these shoes!!!  They were a little tight when I first put them on (I have a relatively wide foot) but they have since stretched out so that they fit perfectly now.  They are very comfortable and I am able to walk in them all day.  There isn't great support at the front of the shoe, but a small insert would do the trick if you have any trouble with this.
0,Great converse
0,Thank you !
0,Always beats other's quality and fit.
0,This is a handsome boot and looks well designed for most environments. It is slightly snug at a point but I figure with some wearing time it will slightly stretch for that perfect fit. The padded insides makes it great for extended wear and of course waterproofing. It feels very durable and I will probably have to get a second pair for my guy!
0,So far I love this set. Better than a more expensive bead I bought the same day.
0,This ring is beautiful! Clean setting with prominent and beautiful stones. Ordered a 7 but it fits like a 6-6.5. I can wear it on both ring fingers comfortably. Excited to wear it around once I get a manicure lol
0,I should have bought these earlier. Comfort and style. Fits great.
0,good shoes thanks
0,This is a very high quality item that looks like it should cost hundreds.  The quality is superior and it is beautiful.  Very happy with this purchase
0,The clothes spectacular better than I imagined it thanks
0,Really a sharp little jacket!
0,I love this watch, it's very comfortable. Also well made and durable.
0,It's soft and very fit. My kid like it very much.
0,I will start by saying I have a LOT of this brand of shoe.  All of them are size 9 with the exception of sandals.  So,  I got size 9 in these.  Can't tell if I like them or not.  They hurt my feet with thicker socks on so I can't imagine wearing them with thin liners.  Must be the silver metal on the toes making my foot hurt.  I don't have wide feet and my toes can wiggle, so not sure what the issue is.  I would go up a half size if I were to purchase again.  Painful shoes aren't fun when they're on you for 8 long hrs in a day.
0,Look good while working and stay warm. Very durable too.
0,Very nice, chic hoodie! My son loves it and it fits his tall, slender frame perfectly!
0,This skirt is just as described. It is comfortable, attractive, cool and easy to care for.  The packaging was very appropriate. It arrived when promised. I would like several more in various colors. I will definitely buy from Bombay Fashions again.
0,Stayed the right size after wash--fit is good.
0,Well made, quality shirt, quality print.
0,Grippy, comfortable, and attractive. The materials seem to have held up admirably since I've purchased as well.
0,Fitted as expected on my 6 year old daughter. She is somewhat skinny.
0,These are the only socks that actually stay on my toddler's feet!  They also have grips on the bottom which definitely prevent falls on our hardwood/tiled floors.
0,very nice quality
0,My very picky husband actually likes them and they fit him well.  The price was great, as it was on sale when I bought it.
0,Hubby loves these work pants
0,Gave this beautiful bracelet as birthday gift! So special, she loves it
0,I bought this in a small which is my usual top size and it fits as shown in the picture. The material is soft and I've washed it several times with no issues of threads coming apart. Will order more in different colors.
0,These are very comfortable for slides and, with a good sole, don't hurt my feet. They did tend to slide a bit but I think that's because they are brand new. The sliding was the only reason for the 4 star.
0,Love love love it!! One of my favs! Would also love it in silver???
0,Anyone who has ever used a shoe tree knows what a difference they can make.  If used regularly, a shoe tree will extend the life of your shoes considerably by minimizing the horizontal wrinkles that naturally develop as you walk around, making them look new(er) long(er).  As an added benefit, they hold the shoe rigid making it much easier to clear, polish and shine the shoes.  These trees are made out of genuine cedar wood, which gives my closet a great, manly outdoorsy smell, and which counteracts any occasional (gasp!) bad smells that might be coming from my shoes. :)  These shoe trees are made very well, use solid cedar on the crown, and are sized specifically for your shoes.  These trees adjust within about a 3-4 size area, so be sure to order the one that corresponds to your size feet.
0,I'm a Frye boot addict, and I own about 10 pair, all of which I love.  But these are perhaps my top favorites because of their versatility.  I've owned these for about 4 years, and I wear them on average about 3-4 times a week.  A few months ago, I had them re-soled and re-heeled and the leather conditioned, and they came out looking brand new.  I expect they will last for many, many more years.  I wear them with skirts, pants and leggings.  They have never, EVER hurt my feet, and they feel like slippers with great arch support.  I cannot recommend them highly enough.
0,This is my second one of these shirts I've purchased. I am a larger guy but I vary from xl to xxl and I recommend going larger on these shirts to allow for shrinkage. I also don't put it in the laundry dryer for the first two washes and let it air dry. After the first two washed the dye is set and doesn't bleed anymore, and the shirt can be dried with the rest of the laundry. The material is heavy weight flannel so heavy weight that some people call my shirt a "Light jacket". I would call it "Man weight". This isn't flannel for city dwelling pseudo lumber-sexuals. This is flannel that you actually wear in the woods (like wear <sic> I live). It's tough, good looking, and durable, wait...This shirt is what I WANT to be! Well...I could use some shrinkage.
0,Just what I needed.  Brick and mortar stores stock sizes catering to either the short fat guy or the tall skinny guy.  These are ideal for me, the big tall guy.  Great fit and comfy too.
0,Love this dress. The fabric is gorgeous and I received many compliments! Can't wait to buy in another color.
0,Great, pleased..
0,My daughter loves it!
0,I ordered my mother-in-law an XXL and it had fit her true-to-size. She said it's very warm and would highly recommend this hoodie.
0,Awesome fit and color
0,Really nice dress.  Nicely lined.
0,vary good boxers we love them im sure they will last as long as needed :) will be buying more. shipped fast frm ky-ca in 4 days vary good with the reg free shipping. we got blk ,red ,teal ,blue and grey.  Son loves them.
0,Hangs nicely. Simple, inexpensive for a summer evening.
0,Excelente
0,very comfortable  like the fit  nice material
0,Nice and roomy, because of all the pockets, without being to big.  Wish it had more color, and came with a wallet.
0,Big pack of soft, comfy socks. what else can I say? They're socks.
0,Good buy
0,I looked for so long for this kind bag. Quality is really good, I can put all my make up and face cleanser, hair brush, moisturizer.
0,These are very stylish and pretty comfortable.  However the sizing is quite off.  Be warned that a 9 is the same as a 10 in adidas, and then stretches a further 1/4 size.  Amazon is the cheapest you can find these usually, and they ship extremely quickly.	The suede has a low nap that is relatively hardy and easy to clean with a simple brush. I have spilt drinks and food on these and it will come out as long as you can get at it right away. The stains will eventually brush out with time.	I really like the rich, chocolatey color to the suede. The shoes are dead simple and is a supporting part of an outfit like a good belt or blue jeans.	These originals do seem to wear out more easily than the bushacre 2s, which are the second iteration of the boot. I recommend trying both.
0,excellent product
0,It is unusual that I can wear a sandal that is not of therapeutic grade because of rheumatoid arthritis and flat feet. This is my third pair of these. They have worn well, but loosened up a bit over time. My foot is somewhat narrow, though I do not buy narrow shoes. Most sandals like this would be sloppy on my foot, but these fit like a glove. They are super cushioned and actually have a decent arch support.
0,These sterling silver sapphire and white diamond dangle earrings are sure to dazzle the crowd with their brilliance and elegance.  I love the quality, price and value from this seller.
0,STRONG MATERIAL AND MANY POCKETS
0,Little man loves these. They are a bit heavy & big, but he loves pulling them on & off. They have room for thick socks in winter.		Update: Dec 2016, I have purchased a second pair in a larger size as he was still wearing his original black ones that were at least 2 sizes too small now despite having been bought others of a different brand by grandma. These are the obvious favorite, and I love how they look.
0,Somewhat ok not to impress by the material. Other wise it beautiful & sexy.
0,Love this. Give it to my grand daughter as one of her presents for her 16th birthday  she loves it too
0,Got these for my Oakleys primarily for driving and riding my motorcycle where I want my glasses to adapt to ambient conditions.  These are a perfect fit in my frames, optically clear, and a fraction of the Oakley price.  They do seem to work well.  The only reason they are not 5 stars is because the images led me to believe that they would transition to a darker tint in full sun than they do 16% sounds like less light than it is.  They do work for most situations but I certainly have lenses that transmit less light, down to 8% and the difference is obvious especially on sunny days here in Southern California.  All in all a great value, and a very good choice for many circumstances.  I recommend them, but suggest you keep a darker lens available if you are somewhere that light conditions get extreme, bright sun on snow, sand, water etc.
0,Fits well, dickies are somewhat small up near the top of the thighs in the front. But fit is very close. Definetly go up a size. I wear a 34 and ordered 36 and they fit perfect. 34s did not fit, I ordered 2 pair just to be safe.
0,I absolutely love these shoes!  I could wear them all day with no problem.  I already knew that most Jessica Simpson shoes normally run small so I got 1/2 size bigger and I'm glad I did.  I can wear them with a normal pair of socks and they fit perfect!  While these look really tall they aren't due to the platform.  Super easy to walk in!
0,I've ordered plenty of dresses online and this one is by far the most striking.  The material is thick, the color is true.  Many manufactures blame your monitor and not the fact that their graphic artist brighten up items to make them pop and attract you to purchase.  However when you get the item at home, it it just looks blah and not worth your time or money to return...you know exactly what I mean.	I'm ordering a few more colors of the Doublju Long Sleeve Drawstring Waist V-Neck. I'm curvy and even with my extra 15lbs. this dress always gets raves.  It does not try to hard which makes it all the more stunning to dress up or down.  Thank you Doublju for your good product and integrity!!!!
0,very comfortable, the opening is a bit tight, but they'll do.  we'll see how they last.
0,Makes packing great but I still overpacked.
0,Love
0,Always great fit and they last so long!! Love them all!!
0,the perfect shoes!!
0,My three year old grand daughter would give this 5 stars but I want to see if it holds up quality-wise.  The color is a lovely shade of pink with a nice glitter in the fabric, not just glued ON it. My grand daughter is tall for her age, but the size is very good (it is a cape after all, and sizing is less of an issue).  Another plus is that the manufacturer is Canadian.
0,Good quality socks. I can tel them apart from the rest of my socks now too, because these ones have gold toes. I'm not a tailor or a blacksmith, but I naturally assume they somehow smelted gold bars and infused them to the fabric using lasers. I look at my old black socks and I SCREAM at them, "You're nothing! You're full of holes!".
0,Very good surprise. Those flats are perfect for work. I wear them almost every day. I wear usually a size 10 but I ordered a size 9.5, according to the other reviews. It fits perfect.
0,Great fit. Good quality. Just what I was looking for.
0,it was smaller than i expected it to be but i don't care, i wear it with everything!! love the material, and the look <3
0,There was a red M inked onto the  side of one of the shoes but my daughter loved them anyways.
0,It'll probably shrink a little, so I'm not disappointed it's a little larger than I thought it would be. The color material and workmanship are good quality. As everything is these days, the price factor is an important element in the value of things
0,These shoes are great for comfort and protection while offering some ventilation during the summer months!
0,Really faded really fast though
0,Expensive, but the best underwear I've ever had. Super comfortable all day long.
0,I was nervous about the "lacy" material not being comfortable.  But these are great.  They fit great.  They feel great.  No breaking in period, they were great right out of the box.  I'd buy them again.
0,I LOVE THIS DRESS SO MUCH. I was worried because it was coming crom china it wouldn't fit me right (be too small) its PERFECT. i'm about a size 5/6 in dresses and a 4 in shirts. Im 5'7 and it lays PEFECTLY. I orderd a pettie coat for it but it looks killer with out it. Awesome price for an awesome product.
0,this dress is great for the club.  it fit me pretty snug i got a 1x.  The material is good.  It is pretty short even on my 5' 3" frame.  I will wear tights underneath and step out in style.  i love it
0,Adorable! Fits perfectly. The fabric isn't high quality, so it's not soft or sturdy, but that's expected at this price range. I'd definitely purchase the same dress in a different pattern with another sale. It's adorable.
0,Great price and I love the way this looks on my husband.
0,I wear this ring every day, and it hasn't turned my finger any funky colors. Honestly, I'm kimd of scared of rings because I hate when they get stuck. This ring doesn't make me uneasy at all since it is adjustable. It's a unique little ring and a lot of people comment on it when they see it. The suction cup detail is amazing, and it is so perfect. The ring does tend to get caught on things, but my ring hasn't been bent or anything from it. I don't regret my purchase one bit.
1,No arch support at all.. like all Uggs
1,I ordered two pairs. This first pair popped two big holes in the thigh as I pulled them on the first time. The second pair has scattered small holes across the foot. Very disappointing, since otherwise the fit was perfect.
1,This watch worked great with the Samsung galaxy s3. I upgraded my phone to the Samsung note 4 and now the watch loses Bluetooth conectivity, fails to download program correctly and is inconsistent in performance. The problem lies in the software gear manager specificly with the note 4. Samsung knows it. They're working on it......  This watch with the note 4 has become useless. Don't waste your money unless you want a paper weight for your desk.
1,So upset that I didn't receive the correct item. This was supposed to be a gift
1,The shirt collar was too large.
1,I really, really wanted to like these shoes. They are really cute, plus they promised the famous Crocs comfort. The patent leather toe is nice and shiny, and the leopard print is matte--you'd never guess that these are the Crocs rubber unless you were scrutinizing them up close. I got lots of compliments on them.		Sadly, these gave me nasty blisters after only an hour or so. The toe box is too low and narrow, yielding blisters on my two small toes on each side. These also curved in too much at the heel, giving me blisters on my upper heels. Thank goodness I keep a pair of "emergency sandals" in my desk drawer at work. I'm returning these.
1,flat foot styling undesirable
1,Size totally wrong.
1,I usually need a medium fit.  I tried the medium and it was too large.  I also tried a small and still too large.  I thought perhaps I ordered a men's top, but this was not the case.  I like this brand but because the size seemed so off, I returned both tops and did not attempt another purchase.
1,Not what I expected had to return it.
1,I have about 10 pairs of Orthaheel sandals. Until I bought this one I bought the wide width (B). When they changed to making all Vionic, the B width was too narrow, so I bought the C-D width. I held up the new sandal to the old ones and my old ones were wider. This shoe was so beautiful, but I can't wear them. I gave them to my daughter who just had a baby and her feet had swollen. They were almost too narrow for her and she wears a size smaller than me. I am done with Vionic ... they have ruined me forever. For expensive flips, they better fit ... and these did not.
1,Very disappointed, very,
1,I was totally confused and disappointed in these camisole tops. First of all, when double checking the sizes I found that all the size tags had been partially clipped so I was never sure of the sizes I recieved.....just had to try them on and hope for the best. The black leather look cami is either mis-sized or I was sent the wrong size because it was way too tight. No way to know with only a partial tag !
1,hate
1,I was not happy with this necklace at all. In the pictures it shows that you can remove the wings from the chain so that you can wear it in different ways however the pendant does not fit over the clasp for the chain so you cannot change the pendant from hanging in the way that it is shipped to you. I would need to break the chain and put it on a different chain in order to try a different look. At this time it is sitting in my jewelry box and has been since the day I received it until I figure out what I want to do with it. Not the best order I have received from KATGI.
1,I have always bought chucks and have wore the same size. For some reason they are big on me for being size 8.
1,Ordered these from the lightning sale.  They do not fit.  I ordered a size larger to take leave room for socks.  These are way too small.  So now I am stuck with a $5.00 return charge.  The leather I received is very stiff so it will take some time for them to break in.  They are attractive but very uncomfortable.
1,This bed jacket didn't fit like the others I have from the same company in the same size.  I literally couldn't get it on so off it went to the Goodwill along with other unneeded clothing.
1,I love the look of these sandals, and they're very comfortable.	However! They make a squishing noise with every step I take. I have tried all sorts of things to get that noise to go away, but it doesn't. There's just no getting around it.
1,I ordered the brown color and I think it looks gray. I don't like it. I hope the person I bought this for likes it.
1,Husband ordered for a rennisancance festival....was really thi fabric and bad stitching. Looked more star wars then rennisancance unfortunately
1,Fast delivery, but beyond that-- In two places in the add, it said the material is cotton; in one place it said polyester. I believe, unfortunately, it's polyester. The material is also gossamer thin; it would have been better to offer half the number at twice the thickness for the same price.
1,It's completely see through, I don't recommend
1,I bought 2 of these shirts in different colors, notice the length in the photo, its not the same as the actual shirt. Bummer
1,The size runs small
1,Too small. I wear clothes with the size 30 and I couldn't even get it past my thighs. If you don't normally wear this brand, go the store first to try on sizes.
1,The size I got is what I normally get, but the waist was rather small compared to what I'm used too and the length was longer	After a month or so of use and a couple washes, that waist seems to have shrank considerably and is now very uncomfortable to wear
1,Scam
1,Nice, but way TOO small.. Sorry!
1,ring dents and scratches really easily - i put this one on friday afternoon when it came in the mail, its currently Monday afternoon. ring has surface dents and scratches all over the place. yes they're hard to photograph, but they're very clear to a naked eye.		i have other titanium rings that i've worn for months that have not a single surface scratch at all - i would say this ring is still cool for the price, but the other ones were similarly priced.		overall still a decent ring, but the benefit of titanium is its scratch-resistance which this one seems to lack. true to size and comfortable, though.
1,They ride down my ankles and only give me blisters.	Hate them.
1,Shoe runs big, get a size smaller
1,Make sure you like the color brown if you buy this suit.  I did not notice from the picture that the color brown is included in the  black, lilac and turquoise print.  It actually looks like a mistake in the fabric since brown does not blend with those colors. Not attractive unless you are into brown.  How about a smaller print on a black background, minus the brown.
1,No support.
1,I purchased a Doublju V neck slimfit shirt.  I really enjoyed the shirt.  I thought this would be similar.  I was totally wrong.  The shirt was did not fit me what so ever.  I purchased a Medium.  I am 5'10" 153lbs. with a slightly muscular frame.  The shirt looked terrible.  It was way too wide and extremely baggy.  I will never purchase another H2H shirt again.
1,hurt the feet if worn to long
1,Received the dress early and the people were very fast to answer questions. But I spent $80 reworking the dress. The the v was off centered and very high up. There was a visible stitch to hold pleats together which was weird. The seams did not match in the back. And underneath the chiffon layer was a weird bubble lining that was filled with crinoline netting. After it was reworked it looked just like the picture.
1,This boot is inferior in materials and fit.  It does not meet my expectations.  Only the color was attractive.
1,The concept of having your check-in ID and ticket is a very good one, but the problem with this product is that the material it is made of is thick and stiff, and therefore bulky and cumbersome. I returned it.
1,Really flimsy. Two colors had already unraveled a lot after ONE washing. The others are wearable but thin and cheap.
1,The price was right and I was hopeful.  It was a tight fit for my Seiko (not much clearance between the watch face and the lid) but it did the job, or so I thought.  I don't wear the watch that often and there is no way to alter to rotation cycle to keep the watch 'charged', so most of the time the watch was essentially dead when I took it out of the case.  Additionally, after only six months, it started making a LOT of noise - so much so I finally had to replace it.  I am VERY disappointed with the purchase and could not recommend it to anyone else.
1,The small size is definitely very large.  I couldn't wear it as it makes me feel so matronly so I passed it to my mother who wears a bigger size.  And even she complaints that it is too big for her but she decided to keep it as it looks good on her.
1,Nice dress but size chart is waaaayyyyyy off! I ordered a large which should be a 12-14. I would say it's a solid 8.
1,Why or why would someone other than a 80's Madonna want their breasts to be pointy? I was seriously fooled by all the so called "good" reviews on this bra.  Clearly some people got paid to love this thing so much.  It's a shame I can't return it.
1,Oh my,this is huge!
1,masculine looking
1,about me: male, 175 cms tall, 230 pounds, extremely flat footed (flattest of flat).	, buying online, looking for a WALKING shoe, with international shipping		Why I chose this product ?	I called up NB USA and asked them which was the best walking shoe for flat footed people.	He gave 2 models, thus NB587 which he said is a running shoe, and another one which was a walking shoe, but he recommended NB587 , seems he was flatfooted himself and has been using this NB587 for long, and it was awesome.		What I ordered ? NB587 width 4E		Issues:	1. Toe box is very narrow. Can't believe a made in USA for Americans shoe will have such a small toe box. This shoe looks narrower than the ones (NB size 4E) available in the Asian markets.	2. My ankle immediately starts hurting when I stand on this shoe. Right from the first second. I thought its just needs some getting used to. I walked more than 20 miles - no change in scenario. Ankle hurts.	3. Heel is too tall, maybe cos its originally a running shoe, but it is highly uncomfortable.		Well, I am stuck with this shoe, as I plonked a lotta dough.		Verdict: DO NOT BUY WITHOUT TRYING IT OUT FIRST.
1,Closure clips looked SO CHEAP and this thing was itchy!	Plus the fur gets caught up in the zipper (has zipper and clips to close it).
1,It's very cute, except it came broken. I would have put the pendant on a different chain, but the charm's "arm" would not have fit. I will be returning it.
1,Didn't quite work as I expected. Instead of wicking away the moisture, I think it held it in. My feet were soaked at the end of the day. Plus they're small, I wear a size 10, but I could just barely get these on over my heel
1,It's a great concept, but they were too bit for my shoes so I had to send them back.
1,Save your money. These hardly polish anything.
1,TOO TIGHT!! TOO STIFF!!! Worse boots I ever tried on my feet!! I live in Alaska, and I have tried on and bought many boots, these SUCK!
1,Doesn't look at all like pictured and not tunic style. This is basically a man's cut oversized flannel.  No shape, boxy and nothing going as described.
1,Had to return - way too tight through calves.  For reference my calves are about 15 1/2 in. at their widest.
1,I bought an x-large cause thats what I wear and they were way to small.. had to give them to a neighbors kid..
1,Too small, needed a size 9, but I kept them, maybe my 13 y/o daughter will grow into them soon.
1,Runs too short from the sides
1,One shoes lights keep turning off.
1,Didn't fit
1,Super cure, but the fabric is so tough that it cuts into your feet even though they are large. I can only wear them for a short period.
1,Do not order ordered a size 4-5 got 12 mo.
1,too, too small.  can't even get them over the top of foot.
1,I can not rate these as they were about one size to large. I sent them back after trying them on. Order small I wear a size 10 which equated to a european size 43. However this was to big so go a size smaller.
1,Though I am sure this style of cut out on the arm is good for some, for me it was too awkward and didn't feel right.  My arms are a little red on the skin and not comfortable showing too much there.  Also did not favor how much cloth hung loose under the arms.
1,Wrong damn size! Disappointed!
1,For the price, these are not totally terrible. However, they run narrow and the back where the heel sits rolls down when you go to put them on. The instep is also small and tight for an average or wide with foot or a high arch. They are a good cheap all weather boot. However, if you have a wider foot or higher arch you may want to look at a different pair.
1,these shorts must be made for dwanye johnson , they're f*ckin huge !	unless your on steriods or your the incedible hulk don't buy them..
1,Do not buy!!  Not made in USA like most Carhartt.  My husband typically wears the work dungarees which are great.  These are thin and poorly made.
1,Uncomfortable shoe to wear all day, and they are not a good solid shoe, it's feel like they could fall apart anytime now.
1,DON'T BUY! This item fell apart at the seams before I could try on.
1,do not buy this....the shape is a all wrong and does not fit little girls. The underwear line cut is way too high - inappropriate and the top comes up short from covering a little chest.  Cheap and terrible.  It's now in the garbage...not even worth sending back
1,It did not feel right to me.  The size was right, BUT the rear lift was uncomfortable and the legs were a bit too long.  Just a strange fit.  I did not return it as I wore it, but I never will again.
1,Seams came apart after one wash.
1,The colors in my pack of briefs were dull. I won't be ordering.from this company again. The material is scratchy.  The washing instructions says wash by hand. Rediculous. I always throw mine in a washing machine and then in the dryer with snuggle dryer sheets to soften. Guess they might fall apart. That's my review.
1,Sorry, the slippers are very cute but painfully tight around the toes & the binding is tight across the top of the heel. I have to return them.	B.Bond
1,They are beautiful but painfully way too small.  For so many years I've always bought the exact same size in Sanita, Dr Martens, etc.  I bought another pair of Sanitas in brown, same size, arrived same time, and they fit perfectly.  For days I've kept hoping maybe the blue ones just need to be broken in maybe, but no.  Just painful.  I've actually had enough issues with shipping/delivery or products that I'm not renewing my Prime membership with Amazon.  Too many problems make it not worth it anymore.
1,zipper broke 2 months out - :(
1,I ordered this thinking it could work post-partum and beyond.  No, no, no.  I ordered the size that matched my measurements and the fit was terrible.  I could barely get the top part over my hips, and then after I finally managed that, the tummy part did not seem to suck anything in at all, even with the corset part closed.  Not good at all, even if I hadn't just had a baby, it just doesn't seem to fit the intended purpose.  I am returning it and will just got with some basic Spanx.
1,I sent them back as they said size 38 but more like 36. Love the look. May order a size 40. Think that will work
1,the belt arrived damaged one of the clasps was broken off so clearly the buckle is too brittle to last very long also a few other deep gouge marks in the metal a shame it was a pretty design
1,Color does not match the picture...way to big.
1,Sized much larger than what I would normally wear. Tried them on and they were like clown shoes. Had to send them back to Amazon for credit.  Not worth the price of the materials used. I would not recommend these to anyone.
1,Didn't like the rubber in the waist.
1,Did not fit
1,These shoes wore out 3 weeks after daily use.  They also squeak!
1,Narrow in the front and squished my toes.  The heel seemed too wide and slipped off the back of my foot.  Did not like the style.
1,Nice size bag. Disappointed with the quality of the "leather" given the price
1,I agree with Sherry, the proportions are odd.  I'm 5'6" and it is hanging on the ground.  However, I found the top portion to be a little large and the bottom is a little narrower than expected.  I did not see the measurements on the page before ordering, but I don't find them to agree with what I received.  I'm keeping it, but will be making adjustments.  Would not buy again.
1,I really wish these boots fit me better. I liked the look, they were warm, and the price was right. Unfortunately they're a bit more narrow in the toe box than most winter boots - this makes them look less clunky, but does not work for my feet. Toe box is not wide enough to feel comfortable with morton's neuroma. These were the first of 6 boots I tried this winter, and finally settled on a pair of Dansko hiking boots that I love.
1,returned
1,These shirts are NOT fitted at all. This is going back for sure!
1,My normal size is a women's 2X which is what I ordered,  however the size 2X I received though pretty, fitted my 22 year niece very nicely, and she wears a size 12.  There should be some set standards for Sellers from China/International to correctly note the sizes equal to the USA sizes, and not state the same sizes as if they are equal, and it costs too much to return.  This is the 3rd time this has happened.  I gave my niece the dress because she liked it, and the other 2 pieces I put in the garbage.  I doubt I will attempt to buy anything else unless this changes.
1,Received 2 Left shoes, I saved them for vacation, so I never even opened them. I now have 2 lefties if anyone needs one!!!
1,Nice idea, but I found these to be heavy, hot, and fit in a way that makes them slide down a lot. I was surprised that my selvedge jeans are more comfy.
1,Love this brand of shoe , have few pair , but sent these back as way to small and a funny fit.
1,I have wore the shoes twice & inside sole is falling apart,would not recommend
1,It's a black purse and it was only $10. There you go. You get what you pay for. But don't think this is anything but the lowest grade of "leather" out there. Thin as tissue paper, if it gets any level of use, it will fall apart before too long. Looks and feels like bottom grade product. Don't waste even $10, really.
1,After receiving this watch, it was much larger & different than it appeared.  Didn't like it al all so I returned it.  The return process was painless so that's why I gave it two stars instead of one.
1,Shoe not as expected, size is so off I really do not know what to say! Nice looking shoe, but, that is it!
1,and they didn't fit quite right. I returned them in favor of Dickies Men's Gen Flex Youtility Solid Stitch Cargo, White, which are terrific.
1,Straps hurt my little toe, so had to return.
1,Very disappointed! I can't believe how deceptive they were. The shirt that they sent me is a very cheap, regular cotton shirt with words cheaply imprinted upon it. It is also  a deep blue, NOT light like in the picture. The shirt is so dark you can barely read the words, which are in the middle and lower half of the shirt; very abnormal. The shirt is nothing like the one in the picture... very disappointed! I want a refund.
1,Tag says one size, its actually about 2 sizes smaller.
1,Me being a wigologist lol, It's an OK wig... It's $11 so what do you expect? Lol . Doesn't look like the photos. It's a 1B , off black. It's very thin and cheap looking. I know synthetic fibers aren't the best quality but this type of fibers are really cheap. Futura fiber is a better quality. If you just want a wig just cause then go for it. It's not really shiny. When I tried to flat iron it, it started to smell. It can't keep a curl. I don't think it was a waste of money, whenever I'm bored with my other wigs , I'll put this on lol
1,this umbrella broke on the second use and there was not even wind when i used it. otherwise would have liked it.
1,These were very puffy. I returned them b/c my son's foot wouldn't fit in his shoe with them.
1,This is pretty and comfortable.  One thing I don't like about this and Sakkas dresses in general is the uneven hem.  I think it looks dopey and unflattering, and I usually have the dresses altered so the hemline will be straight.  My bigger problem with this dress in particular is that it came out of the bag reeking of Febreeze (or something very similar).  I can't imagine why someone would spray Febreeze on a new garment, but it was really disgustingI had to hang it outside for days to get rid of the smell.  I have several other Sakkas dresses, and none of them has smelled, so this was a nasty surprise.
1,I usually wear an XL in scrub tops, so naturally I ordered an XL in this one. It was HUGE! I compared it to one of my older scrub tops, which was a 2XL and it was the EXACT same size! Order a size smaller!
1,Sold as new, but the right shoe had a spot on it.  Ugh!
1,I ordered these mostly because they have pockets. However they run way short and I am only 5'4! The pockets are not very deep, so things fall out, and they shrunk more after they were washed!
1,It's was too tight around and the straps too short...I felt like I was being squished. But it's still cute.
1,I really wanted to like these. BUT the legs are too short - even for ankle jeans - and I am just 5'5". The fit across the upper thigh was not smooth or flattering - and no, I did not gain weight. I returned them.
1,Waiting for a replacement or a credit	Don't know what else to say, disappointed four yr old granddaughter.  grrrr grrrrr
1,Size is not correctly written
1,Has no stretch at all.
1,These are the type of boots that have a rounded knee to fit right on your knee cap. Unfortunately at 5'1 the rounded bulge sat well above my knee and fit like thigh highs. Calf circumference is great for bigger/ muscular calves, but if your under 5'5 I would NOT recommend this style. Returned for the mid calf's in the same brand and color and I LOVE them because they sit right under my knee
1,I bought this watch in HK I absolutely loved the design, its absolutely beautiful but it really isn't durable. All the lovely patterned pieces on the band fell off one by one. I miss the pretty watch I bought, its just not the same. If I were you, I would not buy it.
1,I've been wearing Merrell Chameleons for several years now and I'm very disappointed by this model.  The shoes are so stiff I couldn't get my foot into the opening.  And it wasn't for lack of trying.  I even had a buddy with the same size feet try to put them on and he couldn't do it, either.  I'll be returning these shoes and starting my search for another pair.
1,Bought the gold/champagne color set and they arrived scuffed with a stain on top toe. Sent back. Very disappointing.
1,Blisters!
1,Well what does a man know about woman's watches?  (Disclamier I got this for free through Amazon Vine.)  Obviously not enough.  I saw it and thought my wife would like it as an early mother's day gift (don't worry the real one is already bought).  I gave it to her, she took one look at it and told me to wear it as it looks like as she put it, "It is designed for a man or at least a fully grown Amazon (no pun intended) woman."		Ouch.		For me, (if i could still fit into my 30 yo high school clothes I would still be wearing them so what do i know about fashion) after looking at the watch I am forced to agree it is not the most feminine of looking products and is probably closer to a man's watch than a woman's.  Fashion is a personal taste and on the construction side it does feel like a solidly built timepiece, so if you are a Kate Spade fan and you like the looks of the watch, then by all means I would recommend it.
1,The rubber is so stiff that they were not comfortable, even at a size larger than I wear.  I really like the look, but I knew that I couldn't wear them comfortably for any amount of time.  I returned them
1,Shirts was not as described! The post didn't say it was a slim fit and I returned it. Because of this shirt and 4 others I have decided to never shop for clothes in Amazon again. Very disappointed. oh for the person that said their shrunk I have to laugh. The shirt clearly says Dry Clean only. Wash cold water Gentle cycle. God people learn how to wash clothes.
1,These shoes look cool but they are not comfortable at all. They are painful. It could just be my feet, but I own other pairs of Chuck Taylors and have never experienced this problem.
1,Dint like the quality at all, run large.
1,These  have hard rubber straps and souls that irritate. In addition, they really were uncomfortable and painful with my flat feet. So I returned them and purchased another brand.
1,Very narrow. I couldn't even get my foot in it. A size up would have been long. If you have very thin, narrow feet these are the shoes for you. The rest of us get to keep looking.
1,These did not work for me at all. The outline of the edges were very visible under clothing and overall, there was a an obvious bulging of the product. Maybe it's dependent on size and smaller chested girls have success or maybe it's something to do with the nipple size, all I know is that	these did not work on me at all. I've had better success using a couple of criss crossed band aids.
1,Ordered the X-large, and can't come close to zipping it.  Normally wear a size 14.
1,Fit way too tight and not like regular Levis usually a 34/30 fits fine!!!
1,I was anxiously awaiting this shirt. What a disappointment.  I ordered an XL, but normally wear a M or L, and could not even fit my arm through the sleeve. It appears to be more like an XS. The shirt is uneven and the buttons don't line up with the button holes.  What a waste of money.
1,Love the high low style, but this was Way too narrow around the waist, way too long in the back, much brighter red than the picture, and extremely cheap, easily creasing material. I really wanted enjoy this for a family wedding but had to return :(
1,Not wrinkle-free. I don't like the fabric.
1,smells funny and sheds so bad can't wear it.. to expensive to return not worth it....
1,Ok style.  Don't like the white stripe on the bottom.  Run too small.  I am the typical size 10, med width and these were too small.  Had to return.
1,Pretty print but washed it and I did not put in dryer for fear of it shrinking so, just dried on hangar and material still shrank.  kinda bummed.  And I  bought a large and it looks so small now.  :(
1,Cheap cheap crap dnt buy
1,These are a bit strange with the fit. They don't go all the way up on the back of the foot. I got blisters. Too bad, they look cute, but just not functional
1,Complete garbage it broke the first day I had it on it wouldn't stay closed I had to keep checking it so I wouldn't lose it..After it broke I threw it in my purse and left it there I'm so disappointed. After seeing how cheap looking and weak this bracelet looked I should have just returned it.
1,Hair feels really nice and looks natural.  The poor quality is ok for its price.  The one star is its size that only will fit an infant.
1,Are usually love the Hanes brand but when I receive the shirts they were running way too small. The quality is good but the sizing is off a little will not recommend.
1,Ineffective.  Doesn't have enough of the cooling material to do the job
1,I could barely manage the teeny screw backs on these earrings. Once I did get one on an ear I noticed that it drooped. I have thin ears and the back cannot go all the way down because it is also a front piece. Poor design. Attractive but unusable for me.	I returned them.
1,Cheap broke in month
1,Can't say whether this is a good product or not, they charged me for it, confirmed that it was shipping, but never sent it out. Then, keep on charging my bank account as if they never got payment, it's been eight times now, and they are still trying. Had to put a hold on my account, file a fraudulent use claim, and a police report, who knows if I'll ever get my money back, Amazon needs to just burn and go out of business all together!! I'll be writing reviews on solo shopping sites that list them so people will actually read this, I know they won't post it!!!
1,I'm not a fan of these socks. They're almost like stocking material, at least for the foot part so it's thin. The feet part are also a bit too big for me, but I can definitely still make use of them. The one pro is that they do cover my knees, but I am only 5'0" so if you're taller than that, you may not want to expect that these will be knee socks for you.
1,Way too small for an adult.
1,My son bought these with his own money and was very proud. The kids at his rural NC school made so much fun of them that he came home crying and vowed to never wear them again. So another pair of perfectly good Chinese made shoes go to our landfill. What a shame parents raise their kids to be so bad.
1,It was quite ridiculous when I opened the package and saw these shoes were for an adult. Not even woman, it was for men, this shoe fit a man who wore size 10 mens.
1,too large, sloppy material and see through. Returned them
1,Painful Getting on.  Not at all loose and easy like the commercial.  Just like a gyrtle and the rubber at the top is itchy and flips over.  And even after sucking it on I didn't appear any better in the stomach area.  Not thrilled.
1,So disappointed my daughter has worn this not even a month yet and insole from one of the boots came off  there is no way to glue it she cannot wear it under because it has shallow plastic squares in expose from heal of boot
1,Waste of money. Worst quality. Broken after 20 Rains.....
1,size too small for a x-large and tight changed colors to more brown after one washing!
1,These pants run WAY WAY big. Get about 2 sizes smaller than what you actully need
1,bad and cheap
1,The shoes didn't fit and they refuse to give me a full refund. They are polite and the shoes are in excellent condition, but I cannot wear them.
1,Beware!  Foreign sizes are VERY tricky.  I tried to order according to the chart.  When I got them however, instead of a nice pair of lounging, dog walking shorts I felt like I had on women's tennis shorts!  They were awful, so much so that I threw them away.  If you are muscular and or have a butt these are not for you.
1,These are junk!  I have bought others and loved them.  These don't have clasps to attach them to the jewelry.  Also they have a sticker on the boxes that say $4.00 very clearly, yet, I bought them for $7.99 each.  I am sending them back and won't buy from this company (Body Trends) again.
1,STRONG CHEMICAL SMELL	These are not leather, they're obviously PVC. The seller misrepresented the product as leather/suede which it is not. The chemical smell is so horrific it permeated the entire room and honestly I'm afraid to have my son smell this. He's 2. I threw them outside because they came from China and I have no idea what chemicals are in this. My hands stunk as well even after washing 3 times.
1,The blouse is so cute on the model but doesn't look the same on me.  I can't wear this.
1,Pants are capris not long leggings and material looks and feels cheap. design is cute though.
1,Poo qualify don't waste your money.
1,Served the purpose while in Chicago in Feb, but the material separated where I pull them on.  I was there for 5 days of cold.  That is all the use they got.
1,These were bought for my wife so the opinions here are hers...		Super comfy.  Great traction.  Love the look.  Would be nice if they had another set of eyes on top because the tongue tends to fold outward when they are laced up all the way.  Just a small issue, but that would make them perfect.		Update: 3/13/2018	Original review was 5 star.	Once the boots were broken in, I was very disappointed.  The boot material buckles right above both ankles and stabs into my leg with every step making them extremely uncomfortable.  Also they have no arch support so I had to put in a Dr. Scholl's insole to make them passable.  Additionally the issue with the tongue mentioned above funnels snow into the boot when the snow is a bit deeper. Throughout this winter I have chosen to wear my 22 year old Sorrel boots that these were meant to replace because they are warmer, more comfortable and have better traction. The only advantage these have is they are slightly more fashionable.
1,Get really to have your wallet fall thru the confusing pockets! Nice otherwise..
1,way to long!
1,Love them... Im going to order silver ... very nice set... and delivered fast.  Update...they are turning copper pink color.. and return window closed  10 days ago... Im throwing them in the trash
1,I couldn't walk across the room in them; they kept sliding off my feet.  I gave them to my daughter and she didn't like the high instep.  So, we both got Merrell's and I think these were relegated to the back of her closet.
1,The waist fits well. But the legs are way too skinny. From the description I didn't think they were skinny jeans. The jeans look good but your thighs will feel like you are wear compression tights.
1,too much coverage for me and I expected a thinner lining.
1,The size 5/6 is smaller than an Old Navy 5 by quite a bit. I sent them back & ordered a 7. It was exactly the same size as an Old Navy size 5. I'm not sure what size to actually order at this point.
1,These boots are very cute. Sadly, I received a very damaged box, and very dented and uncomfortable boots from it. They don't cover the shipping to return them even if they're damaged, and it'll cost 1/3 of their value to pay for return shipping. I'd recommend sticking with buyers who have Amazon prime return policies.
1,These are just meh. They tend to roll up and once they have started rolling up, you will spend the entire evening fiddling with them to get them to stay flat. (They won't). I usually end up just wearing one, which still stops the "chub run".
1,Turns out these are "Strech Jeans".  Not what I thought I was buying.  Might be my fault, might not.
1,I guess the whole rocker bottom just doesn't work for me
1,Nice color and quick delivery but fell apart during the commute. After one trip I had to throw this bag away because the bottom tore out.
1,Very sexy but Too big !!!!! I'm a size small and it's not tight enough may have been worn & stretched out before I got it.
1,dial size is about the size of a nickle. its basically a ladies watch. no clue how its sold as mens. gave it to my girl. she loves it!
1,I am sorry to say this because I really love this type of Jewelry and my boyfriend wanted these bracelets really bad. However, we did not have them a week before they started turning/tarnishing. His wrist turned blue/green and they look terrible in less than 7 days.  I have to leave a negative review for any company providing services or products because as a business owner myself I understand what it is like to try and build your business, but it is best to have true honesty in all things. This is not a good product to sell to anyone.
1,Probably better on smaller framed, smaller chested people. No support and really just makes my ladies look bad. The adhesive seems pretty strong at least.
1,Fit was weird.  I wear a 5 and everything was good except that you could not see my toes with the peep hole....daughter laughed at me.  Said I looked deformed....meant to send them back and forgot....so they are rolling around in the original box in my trunk since August 2014....anyone need a pair of shoes?  :)
1,It catches on everything!! Hair, clothes, anything it comes in comtact with. It's pretty, but a big pain and not worth the purchase.
1,Too small in the waist. I have bought the same size Dickies pants in different colors these were very tight in the waist.
1,Although we can't be 100% with online ordering, my wife had high hopes and was excited to receive these for her dance coming up, but when the message said they were delivered and she ran out to get them, opened up a package and small box with just one half sole came in she was rather disappointed. We asked for a pair of half soles not a half of a half. The one she tried on was a bit tight  and uncomfortable and the stitching wasn't on the sole completely. We would the PAIR of half soles that we paid for: BOTH pairs and correct stitching or my money back.
1,NEEDS DR SCHOLLS INSERT THEN OK ,,
1,Waaaaayyyy too small. Seriously..they would have fit if I was 12.
1,See through, the material is like silk...  collar band is very thin.
1,cheep
1,Toes are too narrow. Don't seem to match the structure of the standard Moab shoe
1,This skirt is tiny and made really cheaply.
1,The collar is too narrow and suffocating.	The fabric is rough and itchy
1,Very disappointed, don't know what the material is but it is a really cheap bracelet.
1,overall it is too thick and too straight to be able to get the shotgun in the pocket
1,Bought to replace old pair that lasted 2 years. These lasted 6 months before they started leaking. Not worth the price for that long.
1,In the pic, to me it looks sleek, but in person it looks bulky, sort of like orthopedic shoes. I figured at least i'd have lots of room in the toe box, but then I tried it on and it was very tight fitting - it's the right size for me, its just that I think the memory foam takes up all the room and its not removable. (and maybe the upper fabric designed to sqeeze). Maybe my foot would sink in to the foam with time, but I don't want to take a chance. The foam also hits right on my high arch-it's that thick - and the shoes look like they pronate too much. To me they also look cheap, like something you'd get at Payless, and not like Skechers. The base also sticks out around the foot adding to a clunky look. I'm a long-time skechers fan because of light weight and roomy toe box, but these are dissapointing. I had such high hopes for these based on pic -  why is it so hard to get a sleek looking comfortable footware with wide toe box, light in weight, with actual laces, but not an overabundance of bulky rubber. My faves used to be skechers go lightly in white with silver or gold, but they stopped making them.
1,Nothing in the nomenclature even hints that these shirts are s "petite" size. I am 5'10" NO WAY I WOULD ORDER A PETITE ANYTHING THIS REALLY SUCKS AND THETE IS NO OPTION TO CONTACT GHE SELLER.
1,The shirt came in navy not black. And it looks nothing like the picture. It was soft but I ended up returning it as I wanted something more baggy and was looking for a long sleeve. This shirt barely touched my wrists.
1,Seems cute but I would stay away from these
