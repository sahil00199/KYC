0,I bought this leash and the matching collar for visibility on evening walks. We are easily seen by drivers; the lights definitely command attention. The lights are bright enough and there are many choices of colors.
0,Love little big
0,This is a great dry dog food for my little Yorkie mixed with the beef roll she will eat both....
0,This seat is easy to set up, but you will (obviously) need a harness to attach your dog. I feel so much better knowing that my dog is safer now while driving. He is used to riding on my lap but had no trouble adjusting to his new reality; I think in part because it sits up high enough for him to stick his head out the window. The lining is soft and the bedding is firm. Occasionally, he will curl up for a nap. Prior to placing it in the car, I did leave it in the living room, near his dog bed. That way he got to sniff it out and realize that it was for him. The small fits a Jack Russell, but snugly. I probably should have bought the next larger size, but this is good for now. I don't like the feel of the outside cover, and I'm not certain how long it will last, but I got this on sale, so I'm happy.
0,Very easy to use and replace in the drinkwell fountains.  Keeps water filtered and fresh for our kitty and she loves it!
0,It is larger than the small white cups that tend to come with kennels (which are worthless)- this one keeps more water in the bowl. With this cup, your pet may actually get something to drink instead of wearing it the first time they move the kennel. If you keep water frozen in it to thaw during the journey, see how your dog tends to lie in the crate so you can position it not to drip condensation on his nose.
0,These are fabulous and a great price. Was using Full Moon but these are the same and cheaper.
0,better than I hoped for!  They are good sized and different sizes, which works perfect and I feel they were a good value =) would recommend.
0,exactly as described!
0,Wonderful product to help us train our pets!
0,Works great and keeps litter off my carpet
0,My GSD loves them.
0,Our miniature dauchsund will eat her highly nutritious dog food if she knows se will get one of these low fat treats. Otherwise she might insist on people food not as good for her but not nearly as tasty. Great for bribing your dog to do what is best for her.
0,This has worked great with my chiwahawa. I hated how the retractable leash would pull on her neck when she only had a collar. This harness makes it so the force from pulling or the leash is distributed to mostly her chest. I will warn, however, that you shouldn't leave your dog in the harness unattended. My dogs front leg can get stuck inside the part that goes around the dogs neck. This happens when they've been laying down or rolling around on the ground. I felt so bad after leaving my dog in my apartment for a couple hours and came back to see her hopping around on 3 legs looking at me as if saying, "what's going on here?"
0,A great diet addition for cats who don't eat or don't eat enough.
0,Really nice quality. The wires are pretty thick compared to come kennels I've had in the past. It seems really sturdy and I like that it has two doors. My dog doesn't try to escape, so I can't really say how well it would stand up to dogs that try to get out of it, but it seems strong. I use this one for traveling (I have a jumbo one that I keep at home) and it's kind of awkward to carry just because of the size, but it's not too heavy at all.	I got a 36 inch for my 30 pound dog and there's plenty of room in it for him to get up and move around.	My only problem was that I couldn't figure out where to put the carrying handle that it came with, but it's easy enough to carry without a handle so I don't really care about that.
0,My Golden Retriever has plaque problems and very bad breath.	The petzlife spray has heped remove some of that plaque and certainly helps with bad breath.	Don't expect it to completely clean the teeth.	I would recommend it even though it is costly.
0,my gliders LOVE this. can comfortably fit 2 gliders
0,I got one of these about 3 years ago, and it still looks great. I just moved so I am about to order a new one
0,Arrived on time and the cats love it.
0,FAST DELIVERY. HAD TO RETURN. WAS TO SMALL FOR MY LAB.
0,Treats bacteria and yeast effectively, quickly, and naturally. We love this product.
0,Purchased two of these, one for our male Boykin/Aussie mix (60lbs) and one for our female Boykin (30lbs), by far these are the best harnesses we ever purchased.  Once you have it fitted properly, it is a quick over the head, two snaps and you're done.  I know many will say it doesn't help with pulling, however training not to pull is essential.  If ours begin to pull we give a slight tug back and they immediately ease up.		I highly recommend this harness.
0,what I expected
0,The dogs LOVE these balls.  They can play and chew them without destroying them!
0,We are still in the training process. The halter fits well, I think. It looks like its a turtle neck, but then again,, she's laying down - because god forbid you put anything constricting on a cat! It is pretty hilarious watching her try to walk or really do anything with it on. I know, I'm a mean mommy. Anyway, the halter is well made. It arrived pretty stiff so I am trying to soften the velcro straps as much as I can, especially around the neck. I does come with a nice little booklet with helpful suggestions and directions.
0,These are the only pet hair rollers that will actually pick up all the hair.
0,My pup lost the first one I purchased along with his rabies tag. The rabies tag was recovered but I had to purchase another one like that one. It was a no brainer to reorder. These are exactly what you would need to tag your pet!
0,this product is exceptional. I opened the bag and a picky eater smelled it immediately. I mixed it with her regular dry and she picked out the old brand and ate the Orijen. The bits are flat ovals and our kitten didn't have any trouble chewing it. No upset stomach as we transitioned to a new product. Winner winner Orijen Dinner!!!
0,Works great! I love it and will buy again.
0,Until we find the perfect solution, we must close off the room that houses the cat's food bowls and litterbox, while still giving kitty access.  Otherwise, our dog will enjoy litterbox snacks and cat food.	We have used regular baby gates propped against the door which took up extra space and looked sloppy and out of place.  This gate with the cat walk thru gate is a nice alternative.  It was easy to pop into place and holds firmly between the doorway.  Cat learned how to use his door immediately.	The only issue is that there is no way to keep the cat door locked open and we don't want him to accidentally lose access to his space.  We ended up using a zip-tie to keep it open, which creates less opening for us humans when we open the gate door.  The gate door is not overly wide to begin with, so with this in place, we do get some nasty upper thigh bruises from time to time.	Overall, it is a great alternative to a plain wood gate and the kitty door is a smart inclusion.
0,Made in USA.  I'm very picky about my dogs' toys and chews.  I've seen too many dogs die from chewing/eating Chinese made products.  I do have super chewers!  Two very large German shepherds, so they are rough on toysl  I've bought these for years.
0,Dog likes them and that is what they are for.
0,Arm & Hammer Litter is great for my two cats and very affordable too. I can carry heavy items from the grocery store like I used to, so purchasing from Amazon is a blessing and it gets delivered to my door.
0,Was just what I needed
0,Fantastic!  This has far surpassed what I thought I was going to get for the money!  My cat is loving this cat hammock! The scratching pad has put an end to my sofas torment, and the little rattle balls drive my cat crazy.  Very well made, love the color.  Will be trying more if this companies products!
0,I love these and so do all my small animals! They are a great favorite in my household. My Syrian ham uses them for potty purposes and my other hamsters/gerbil use them for nesting.
0,This product is a great buy! I decided to check Amazon.com after the vet recommended a joint supplement for our 40lb shepard mix. The product they recommended was very expensive, I thought anyway at $60 for 90 pills. This was probably one of the first ones to come up, but with the strong reviews (even with complaints about the taste) I decided to give it a go. Turns out my dogs ***LOVE*** these pills!!! It's probably their fav treat! So I'd say give it a chance, you might find your dogs actually love this product!
0,Cat eats it. Better price for a healthier product compared to elsewhere. Will buy again
0,Awesome gravel!  I love it.  Great price too.  In store they wanted $15, here I paid about $5 and was able to buy a couple bags for how much I needed.
0,This brand is the only one that gets rid of both urine smell and mess.  Product made specifically for wood floors. Does not leave residue or remove flooring stain color or shine after wipe up.
0,Love that it becomes a second toy even when the stuffing is torn out.
0,I'm not sure what I expected when I ordered these. I was somewhat surprised to learn that you had to microwave them. It doesn't take long though, and it only takes a few minutes for them to cool. If I'm impatient I'll toss them in the freezer for a few seconds. They do have a very slightly unpleasant odor, but so do most of the other treats my dog gets. He really enjoys these though and even the cat tried to nibble on one before the dog took it away from her.
0,We purchased this heated house for the little stray that lives outside our house. We got it in hopes that it would keep him warm come winter. It hasn't even been cold yet and he's already using it! He comes crawling out of it all warm and relaxed! This is definitely worth the money. Putting it together was a breeze, and it's the perfect size. I'm really glad I found this.
0,I am always in search of high quality, grain free food that my pets enjoy. I ordered one of these with some other dog food and my dogs loved it (I have three med-lg dogs). These remind me of my grandmother's cookies: they smell good (I am tempted!), they stay in the shape but can be easily broken and crumbled, they are good for the pets!		YES! They do smell great and are made from Turkey, Chicken with vit. E and they also have a calorie count for the dogs on a diet! They are made by Blue Buffalo.		I ordered more of these from Amazon from this seller for Christmas and got them on Christmas Eve (just in time!) using two-day delivery (many Amazon manufacturers don't always ship timely). I will definitely order these again.		The only downside: They only come in 10oz packages and are fairly expensive. But I didn't take off for this since I am so happy with how my dogs love them! The Blue Buffalo firm also needs to make the expiration date larger and ensure you can see it. I always check the dates and this was hard to find/see on these (and I have had suppliers send me several packages of food that was expired, so this is important). None, that I can tell, were out dated here and they actually smelled fresh, but it should be easier to see.
0,our cats enjoy it..
0,Reba, my Chi mix, loves these things. I put some small treats inside then stuff it with peanut butter and pop it in the freezer. When I am going out and leave her alone I giver her the KONG and she is kept busy getting the treasure out. She probably doesn't know I have left til its empty. Helps relieve the guilt of leaving her alone.
0,Purchased this at the LFS for $50... What an excellent buy!! The filter is great & really makes the water clear. I just wish it came with moonlight version on the LED light, but, otherwise it's perfect.
0,I love the product, hate the price.  But, in all fairness, Amazon has about the best prices out there.
0,Good for my dog
0,Our cats love it!
0,Convenient and well made.  It's easy to fold up and put in your pocket, very necessary for those long walks.
0,My two mini Aussies love to tug o war. This is one of their favorite toys
0,need bigger ones but these work fine in my 50 gallon tank
0,I have five dogs now, and have had many more over the course of my life and, as you can imagine, I've purchased quite a few dog bowls over the years.  These are easily my favorite out of all them and I now have one for each of my dogs' food bowl (in various sizes), plus two more for water bowls.  That said, there are a couple of design flaws that I would love to see corrected somehow (if possible).		The first one has to do with the rubber, non-slip ring that is on the bottom of the bowl.  It works well and tends to stay in place for the most part, but it is removable and I've had a few fall out and either the dogs chewed it or the lawn guy thought it was trash and threw it out.  As far as I can tell, Loving Pets does not sell replacement rubber rings, so I've ended up purchasing new bowls to replace what is otherwise a perfectly good bowl.  My two water bowls are, in fact, two of the bowls that have lost the rubber ring, since the dogs don't push those around the way they do their food bowls.		The second flaw is so minor as to hardly be considered a flaw, but the bowls are constructed with two layers - stainless steel on the inside and plastic (they call it poly-resin) on the outside.  The two layers are not directly attached to each other and there's a layer of air between the two.  As far as I can tell, the place where they join together is just at the lip of the bowl.  Apparently that join location isn't water-tight, because when I have bowls soaking in the sink, water manages to find its way into the space between the plastic and steel, so now my bowls sort of slosh around when I'm feeding the dogs.  I don't think there's any detrimental impact from this, but it's a little weird.  I would think that a small drain hole or two would resolve the issue, but then that might impact the integrity of the plastic/resin outer layer.		Anyway, neither issue is worth deducting a star - these are still the best bowls I've ever used and I'll continue to buy them on the rare occasions when one of the existing bowls gets damaged.
0,Love this!  The hose is nice and long so it doesn't require me to scoot my pups up to the front of the tub.  I actually replaced the hose on my waterpic shower head with this while I was at it.  The shampoo fill up is sort of a bear to get open if you have thick fingers, but that's my only complaint.  What I like best is that I can get the water temp set the way i want, then release the button and the water stops and does not keep running.  This means I only have to depress the button and let it run a few seconds and it's back to the temp needed.  This really makes giving my 3 mini schnauzers a bath easy and with waaaaayyyy less mess.  They also seem to like it better than using a the shower head.
0,We had a kitten that was sick and we tried every brand and flavor of food but she refused them all. This was the only flavor that she would somewhat eat and we were appreciative to find it. Unfortunately, she took a turn for the worse and we donated the rest to the animal hospital. Although Wellness was our first choice, our vet said the ingredients in this were great. I'd have to agree with other reviews on the fishy smell though.
0,For the price no one can beat amazon. the kids are getting gerbils after Christmas so we are setting up the cages before hand . this bag is huge and will last months. This bedding is great because it better for small animals than the pine bedding and does not smell. In fact it does not smell so you have to remember to change the cage. We have used this for our last set of gerbils, towards the end of their life after it was suggested to us as they were always sneezing with the old pine bedding and it smelled bad even right after a cage change.
0,I love it puppies set very still when I'm using it.
0,I have been using on my 6.5 lb Morkie and the size works great.  This design beats a regular toothbrush in my opinion.  Worth getting but advise you start on a puppy and make it a regular practice or any brushing with any brush will be difficult!
0,Pros:	The brush is of the highest quality-very well made.	The size is perfect for our King Charles Cavalier Spaniels.	The bristles smooth the coat and add shine.		Cons:	The brush is expensive.	The handle is uncomfortable for me to hold which may be due to the handles' direction when brushing. If the handle was rounded or better yet, ergonomic and longer, it would make an improvement to the overall feel of the brush.		Overall, the positive qualities of the brush make up for the Cons listed above and I would buy the brush again.
0,My lizard always love this ladder.
0,I had three kittens and they mad one hell of a mess, litter always kickied all ove rt he floor. useing this helped a lot to keep the litter where it beliongs. I still had a little out the front but only the first 6 inches or so. where before litter was in all directions. I will buy ans I would rcomend to anyone to buy this product.
0,For dogs and cats.		These freeze dried  chicken  breast pieces are lighteight and can be easily crumbled.  They are to be used as treats  or food toppers, but not for meals because they are protein only  and do not provide a balanced meal.	They have no aroma.		Our Labradoodle likes these.  I offer them as a training reward.		When I visited their website (trying to find the country where the chicken is sourced from), I  learned that the Halo Company has won numerous awards. However, I did not find any information regarding the chickens source.	The product is made in the USA.
0,Cats love liver and older cats, especially, need good nutrition in their food.  This selection adds variety to the Natural Balance Canned Cat Food line as it is also important not to feed fish more than 2x a week and still feed for the best nutrition available.  Recommend spending a bit more for better nutrition as inexpensive in the long run and Amazon has good prices.
0,Sometimes small, infantile non-humans find it difficulty in translation.  I will try.		I want chicken I want liver	Meow Mix Meow Mix	Please Deliver		I want chicken I want liver	Meow Mix Meow Mix	Please Deliver		I want chicken I want liver	Meow Mix Meow Mix	Please Deliver		I want chicken I want liver	Meow Mix Meow Mix	Please Deliver		We're all good here.
0,This is a generic pet barrier.  Works well, easy to install. And does the job.  My Lab mix does not lunge against it, she's just happy to go for a ride in the car.  But if she did, it would hold up well.
0,good
0,We have a yellow lab who is just over a year old. He happens to be pretty snobby about his food. He will only eat human food or Purina Pro Plan Dry Dog Food. Don't even try to give Hunter pedigree. He has a healthy digestive system and the food is not hard on his stomach. I haven't eaten it, but he has so if he gave this item a review he would say "ruff ruff!! Arf arf arf" with a doggy smile.
0,awesome
0,Great product perfect.
0,This is my Zoeys favorite toy wherein I can engage playing with her. Very, Very sturdy. Its flexible and stretchy. Most toys like this break rather quickly, especially when she pulls on it with all her weight and strength. Love this product. My friend got one also and had same experience. Great entertainment.  Great price for a superior product.  Paid lot more for toys that fell apart in few days.
0,My two cats love this food!  They think it's a treat and come begging for it.  So no problems with getting them to eat it.  I like that the first ingredient on the package is "Chicken".  There are no grain fillers, which I don't think is actually good for your cat in the long run, although they can live on it.  The dry kibbles seem to have some kind of oily coating - maybe from chicken fat?  It has a 'meaty' smell to it that the cats seem to be attracted to.		So if you want your cat to thrive instead of survive, and you prefer feeding them a dry food, then I think this cat food would be excellent for you.
0,I have been using Aquaclear power filters in my aquariums for 20 yrs, and won't be changing. Top quality construction, and IMO, the best design out there for general hobbyists. Because of the separate media packages, you can change media as needed for current water conditions without changing everything. This keeps the beneficial bacterial flora intact in the other media components. Will never purchase another brand!
0,Works great with my pit mix. I wanted a collar for my dog that would correct him fast and this works great I love it more than regular ones!
0,Very pleased with this cat mat. Amply large to fit a cat. Soft and comforting. I put two of them out on my chaise lounge in winter because a dear little stray likes to sleep there on the roofed-over porch. He refuses to be trapped so I just let him take up residency. He enjoys snuggling down on the cat mats plus the cushion of the chaise lounge. I have bought three mats for use on the porch.
0,It's a good product in that I don't have to take the chance of drawing aquarium water into my mouth.  I think you should consider offering the extensions - I ended up having to search to find them.
0,It clicks perfectly to me and I didn't find any dripping. The handle at the top can just be used when the litter box is empty because when it's full it's too heavy.	It also looks fancy-modern, which I like.
0,This is one of only two toys my dog (a rather smallish miniature dachshund) has not been able to destroy. I should mention that my eight pound dog has destroyed all sorts of fun, expensive and so called "durable toys". He even shredded one that was "lion tested".  This one is not only durable, but truly a favorite. I failed to read the dimensions of this when I ordered it and was very surprised  to see that it was a great deal longer than my dog. I was worried at first that I'd boffed up in purchasing it - but that worry quickly dissipated as my dog went in for the kill and wrestled with it all over the living room. Be WARNED, if you tuck this into your doggies away bag and your unsuspecting friends see it they may well think you've accidentally packed a naughty bedroom toy of your own. MONTHS later and this toy is still going strong - there are a few teeth marks, but nothing that compromises the safety of the toy.
0,We bought the Drinkwell Original Pet Fountain to simplify our neighbors feeding our cats while we were away. It works great! And now the cats won't drink any other way. This is my 2nd drinkwell as I warped the first in the dish washer. We don't use the top because one of our cats insists on knocking it off. Best prices here on products and filters.
0,I bought this as a last ditch effort to help my fat cat (19.5 lbs, eek!) lose some weight --- the next step was going to be a consultation with the vet. She's lost a couple pounds after eating just this and the occasional treats and/or dollops of wet food (Wellness Cat food, or Spot's Stew) in the 2 months she's been eating it. A lot of her weight and girth seemed to be bloat so I thought perhaps grains were playing a role. So far she's very noticeably less bloated, lost a couple pounds, and is way more energetic.
0,Works awesome!
0,My dog loves these bones and I feel confident giving her something that is made in the USA!  I trust the Nylabone name!
0,The only treats my very picky dog will eat!
0,I like how it doesnt choke the neck area of the cat. And the bungee is a nice idea. Just a few things that I don't care for. First: I was reading on how to train a cat to be comfortable with a leash and harness and learned that you do this by having him get used to the harness first by leaving it on him, then once he is used to it you introduce the leash. This harness does not work well without the leash. there is part that kind of dangles up between his shoulder blades if the leash isn't attached.	Second: I ordered this on Amazon because they had the black one. Every store I have seen that had them in stock only has a very bright blue or red. The leash is black, but most of the harness is actually a light gray. Little bother but still.
0,I received the Dog Leash Harness,URPOWER Adjustable & No-Pull Leash Set & Heavy Duty Denim Dog Leash Collar for Small and Large Dog, Perfect for Daily Training Walking Running (Small 8-15.6lbs) free or discounted for review.		The small fit my daughter's mini dachshund perfectly.		Soak in salt water to soften when you receive it. I soaked mine for about two hours and rinsed well. Some dye did come out hang to dry or dry with towel you do not mind being ruined as dye did get on my towel. Make sure to get out all dye to protect dogs skin.		The harness is very nice and stylish even. Safer for dogs than walking with a leash attached to collar!		The leash is a good length - my son in law to be is over 6 foot 2 inches and the leash was long enough for him even walking a mini doxie!		That is their Link wearing the harness in the photos below, isn't he cute? The harness looks great on him! He really seems to like it too - so much better than using his collar which can be difficult to control his movements, plus it pulls on his little neck. This harness is a much nicer option for him.		I also like the denim design being more unisex for both male and female doggies.		Stitching and seams are well done, well made, good quality material.
0,Just what I wanted for my dog.  She tears up other toys just to get to the squeeker, so this product is great for me.  Thank you
0,Seems to be working, Dog loves it!
0,so cute!
0,Amazing quality!
0,Unfortunately I didn't really get to use it because I messed up on my measurements ... i.e. I just didn't take them... and had to return it.	However, when I pulled it out of the box it was packaged well and the doggie door is super well made. It feels and operates like a very well made item. I do plan to order it again in the correct size. But so far, I like what I saw.
0,I call these snacks "fish cookies". My dog absolutely loves them. I was feeding her "beggins" and other grain type snacks until I realized my dog was allergic to grains, so I had to find a grain free dog food and snacks. Turns out she loves Salmon, or stinky fish in general, so this fit the bill.		They are made with only one ingredient, Salmon. They are also made in the USA unlike other brands that are made from Chinese sourced ingredients. The treats in this bag have a strange odor but they are fish so that is expected. My dog has a healthier coat as well, I think it might be the omegas from salmon? Anyways I will continue to buy these for my dog.		My only complaint is the price. They are somewhat pricey and can be found much cheaper at your local grocery store. The only reason I would buy from Amazon, at this price, is if I cannot find them at my local store.		Overall, these are great snacks and healthy
0,The top I HAD, that used a florescent bulb, was at least flat on top.  My fish feeder will most likely fall off of this one because it is rounded almost all over.  The only access for the feeder is right over where the filter empties into the tank (which may clog the feeder because of the excess moisture there).  Also instead of being able to flip up just the FRONT of the top, the new top is hinged in back, so you must lift the entire lid to pour in more water when it gets low.  This makes it inconvenient to catch fish as well, because when you lift the entire lid you no longer have a light in the tank.
0,Works well.
0,Actually, my abykat loves it!
0,fresh and arrived quickly
0,I have one dog who just hates a crate so I decided to give this a try.  She loves it.  She's a 12 pound dog and this is a great size for her.  Her bed fits in here plus there's enough room for her to have a water bowl.  I leave the gate open when I'm home and she loves going into her little palace.  I'm not mechanical but this was easy to assemble and it looks decent enough that I'm not embarrassed to have it out.		My dog is older and not very assertive.  I'm not sure how an energetic dog would do as it's not very heavy.  I think if a dog were to jump or push on it, it would be easy to move it across the floor (I have tile).  Mine doesn't even attempt that so it's worked great for me.
0,Well I do not love it but the pups eat it up.  1 can of this and three cups of kibbles feeds both pups.  As long as the price it right I will continue to buy.
0,My Vet gave me a thumbs-up on the Excel Pads. Another client in the Vet's office told me that she uses them and they are very efficient.
0,My dogs loved flavor super easy to make
0,We've been using this for about 2 weeks now and its already made a dramatic difference on our dogs nose. Very, very pleased. Great product, great price!!!	The company was great to deal with, very knowledgeable about their product and stood behind it 100%
0,GRAPEFRUIT IS LIFE
0,Are what they are; reasonably priced.
0,I have a small dog that is very picky about treats, but she really likes these. I like the fact that they are just chicken with no other additives or fillers. Treats have great texture, easy for small dogs to chew.
0,Item as described and received on time. Thank you
0,I have used Boi Spot now for 8 years on Same Dog Pit mix he is 72 lbs. and I have never had a problem.	We have gone boating/fishing playing in woods (chasing squirrels) Town house so no treated yard, we go walking over untreated grass	OH it repel mosquito at that WHAT!. This helps, I live in Savannah, GA KIng of gnats & skeeters also biting flies, it works on mosquitoes	although it does not stop biting flies,(they leave big whelps) .The winter months in Ga by Dec to March I don't even put it on him and still	nothing (Fleas).The only time I did have A problem, is when I ran out for a week but just a few Fleas during Mid Summer.	I have never used any other product cause I had no reason to/ (I did not even mention the low cost)	It is two thumbs up for me and two dewclaws up from my dog. not to many repel mosquito at that.	You need a Clean house and yard treated for flea, then give dog bath fully dry, add bio spot.
0,Fantastic detangler. Did a great job loosening the mats and getting them out. Also purchased the Four Paws Magic Coat instant mat removing comb. Highly recommend.
0,Only litter that clumps fast, contains odor, and my cat actually likes to use. She is front declawed and tends to be sensitive to the size and texture of many litters. What I love most about this litter is the clay never sticks to the sides of the litter box, which I have experienced with other brands. Cleaning is always quick and there are rarely ever soiled litter bits left behind. I use this size to fill two litter boxes every month for one cat, and have no complaints.
0,dogs love
0,My two dogs, a corgi and a terrier-dachshund mix, adore these, but I have to try to break them in half to suit the size of my dogs.  I wish they came in a pack of all small cookies, but that's not a really big problem.  These are thicker and harder than the All Star Blue Dog treats I wasn't able to get via Amazon the last time we needed some treats.  That factor does give the dogs a bit more chewing time, which they enjoy.
0,thanks
0,These scratching boards can totally save your furniture. Wow! Cats love them. All cats should have these so they can act out their natural instincts to scratch. If you don't have these for your cat and you punish them for scratching your furniture then your just being cruel.
0,I have no idea why this product works but I've had three Golden Retrievers for years and this is the only product that I have used in twenty years that actually prevents brown spots for dog urine.
0,Great value for the price  Doesn't slip
0,I order this food to try as it was grain free and I liked the ingredients listed on the site with the reviews. I opened the bag and the smell was incredible. It almost made me hungry lol. The dog loves it and is doing well on it.	  I start doing more research on the food and was very impressed. The owners of this food make sure ethoxyquin, BHA and BHT (which are knowing to cause cancer) are NOT used at all in the food. They make sure that the slaughter and processing plants do not use them either. That is great and it show that they care as well.	  I have communicated with the Petcurean and have been very impressed with them as well. I am really happy with this food. It has very good ingredients. he company is great. I highly recommended this good and I have tired several different grain free dog foods.  Plus my dog loves it.	  Thank you amazon. i would have never found it without amazon.
0,This lead matches the spring blue Puppia harness and by dog looks so cute with the matching set.  I usually use a retractable leash, but this comes in handy when we aren't taking long walks.  No problems with shipping and the prices on Amazon are always great!
0,This is o.k. litter but it has fragrance even though marked fragrance free (I am very sensitive to manufactured odors, though, so others might not notice it) and it seems to be dustier than my preferred litters. It also seems to have a shorter effective life. I have eight cats, though, so I am a pretty tough customer. It would probably work fine for a one or two cat home.
0,Cats love these treats.
0,These boots were the first I have ever purchased so I don't have anything to compare them to, but they were very well made, not difficult to get on and stayed on. However the bottoms did not have enough traction to keep my dog from slipping on the stairs, which is why I bought them. If you just need to protect your dogs paws for some reason I think they would be great for that use. I give Amazon's customer service 5 stars (as usual!) -- would rate higher if I could. I ordered them late Friday afternoon with overnight Saturday delivery and had them before noon the next day. When I returned them because they did not work for me the refund was painless and prompt.
0,Nice piece for my son's aquarium.  A previous review stated that you could request the white, red or blue.  Unfortunately this isn't factual, it's whatever is available at the time.  Luckily we did receive the color we were hoping for.  It has been in our aquarium for a month now and is a product I would highly recommend.
0,Fits perfectly, lovely turquoise blue color, and the label was easily removed with a seam ripper. Very happy with my purchase and the clasp is easy for me to open, and that's not usually the case with tiny closures.
0,finally!  a dog food that my dogs LOVE to eat and enjoy.	no hesitation to eat this and they seem satisfied until their evening feeding.		worth the $
0,I walk dogs for my job, these little treats are always a fan favorite among all my pups, big and little. There are a ton in this bag so they last for a long while which I appreciate!
0,Very durable through many, many washings
0,It's like I don't even have the same dog anymore. I put the collar on him and let him get used to it then went outside with him. He started to eat some mulch out of the planter and I corrected him with a NO command and hit the tone button. He stopped for a minute then went back to trying to eat the bark. I once again said No and gave the tone but followed it with a zap of the collar and he immediately dropped the mulch and came over to me. That is the only time I have had to zap him. Now I just give the command and maybe a tone and he behaves. He is no longer getting into everything and anything and by just showing him the controller for the collar he will behave as directed.
0,Purchased these bags on a lightning deal do I can't complain about thr price for a 1000 bags. Yes, they are a about .5" shorter than specified but do the job. Personally, I think they are thinner than some other bags I've tried. We have a 60+ lbs mixed and the bag is just about right for one of his loads. There is enough to tie the bag in a knot. Unscented and does a decent job keeping the smell within. Overall, good enough bag that works for us.
0,Great size for a cat or another type of small pet.  HEAVY for the size and will not tip over.  These were a lot less $$$ when I purchased them and would not buy again at the current price but when they go on sale or are listed as add on items... well worth it.
0,Every evening when we return from our walk, my pup runs to the refrigerator and waits for his special ice cubes.  I give him one cheddar flavor and one of another flavor and he absolutely loves them.  He's only moderately interested in plain ice cubes, but he loves these.  They are very simple to make and provide a quick and healthy treat, especially appreciated  on a hot day.
0,It fits my 55 pound bobcat very nicely. It looks good and easy to put a leash on the harness to take him for walks outside. Thank you very much. Linda Graves
0,The build quality seems to be high on this one. However, I wish the thermometer was accurate. Turning the knob to adjust temperature is also very hard to do. Keep in mind that these are minor issues compare to solid performance and durability, so I would recommend this product.
0,Squeaker died right away, but that is expected with my pup. he loves it
0,Good price
0,I had this overnighted, along with a larger bag from Amazon, of their soy free Small Animal Recovery food. One of our favorite guinea pigs has been refusing to eat or drink properly, for weeks. I had to make a slurry of her regular pellet food, and force-feed her, just to get some nourishment into her, and put her water bottle into her mouth so she would not get dehydrated. Despite that, she was dying.		Over the years, I have had LOTS of guinea pigs. Usually, if they are ill, they don't last more than a week. This little gal has hung on for a long time, but was getting "bony-thin" and lethargic. Her eyes were crusty, as was her nose, and she could barely move.		Well, I just gave her the Sherwood SARx for the first time, yesterday, and she ate it from the syringe like she was starving! That's because - she WAS! She has been fed it, via syringe - mixed according to directions - about 8 more times. Her eyes have cleared up, her nose looks good, and she is definitely putting on some weight.		We have had males and females, old guinea pigs, and baby guinea pigs. Never have we had one so determined to live, and after trying everything else I knew to do, I had this over-nighted to us in hopes it would help our sick little girl. She is older, and may still leave us, but she LOVES this stuff! It sort-of smells like anise, and she literally eats it like candy. Again, she may not recover, but now, she is not slowly starving to death.		These results are only from a bit over a day, but what a difference that day has made. I am very impressed with the product!		***I WISH the people who manufacture this would grind it finer. The Critical Care from Oxbow goes through a syringe a lot easier. I always cut off part of the syringe tip with a razor blade, when needing to use one for our guinea pigs. Nevertheless, the Sherwood SARx clogs the syringe. The powder can be put in a small seed or grain mill to make it finer, but it would be nice to have it "powder-fine" right in the package.		I am also feeding her Critical Care, and she laps both of them up with enthusiasm.
0,We started with the dry kibble version of this formula, which my dog really enjoys and eats without any hesitation! It is great having the option to add canned food as a treat to her regular meals. Because this is the exact recipe, there no digestive upset. There is a nice gravy, chucks of meat, and small bits of vegetables. It has a nice smell unlike some canned dog foods, which are pretty unappetizing to the human nose. My dog is 10 years old, and usually gets gas with chicken based dog food, but she has no problems with this food. It is very digestible, and she has a consistent b.m. We highly recomend the dry and canned  versions of this formula for your older dog!
0,Very nice having the longer teeth.  Doesn't bother my dog's hair so much when I try to un-mat it.
0,Great feeders.  I bought both the 16" and the 12" for my dogs.  I am very pleased!!
0,I have a 120 lb malamute. I bought two of the XXL thinking that they would fit with room to spare. They fit perfect. If he was any fatter however they would be too small. I got mine used but in perfect condition. Each was only 10 bucks.
0,This is the first time that my dog tries this food and he really likes it but he prefers the fish flavor. Affordable price for good food.
0,I love these puppy pads.  I use them to line the cat litter boxes.  Also, I use them underneath the cat food bowls, to keep the floor clean if a cat paws some food out of the bowl.  They work great for the purpose intended, as well as for these other uses.
0,this was not a martingale collar, just a regular one, like the picture shows.
0,I've been buying this litter from amazon for about 4 months now, my cat loves it. The litter has a nice scent to it that does a great job at blocking cat pee ammonia odor.		I have a very clean picky cat and she loves this litter. I purchased multiple litter products from Amazon from pine litter to all natural litter and my cat was not satisfied with any of them, after a few days she would pee on our rug, but not with this litter, I scoop it daily and it always smells fresh.		PROS	- Litter clumps well, easy to scoop	- Has nice mild scent, blocks cat pee ammonia very well		CONS	- The handle at the top of the box can be weak at sometimes and rip		Country of Origin: USA
0,Excellent pet food mat. Just the right size.
0,Yes I love this product and some of my parakeets chew on the toy's. It's a nice size for the price.
0,I bought this for my friend's pet, it appears very sturdy and well made.
0,It snaps together (hard to do) and works as described. The dog I purchased it for likes it. She doesn't have to put weight on her injured shoulder (which  is why I purchased it).  It's easy to clean and is very sturdy. Arrived in 2 days		My other dog wants nothing to do with it. He gave my husband the stink eye and ran to his bowl on the floor at dinner time and waited for the food to appear in the floor-bowl.  Apparently, he's more of a traditionalist. I would purchase another for him but I'm not sure he would use it.
0,all 4 dog favorites.  lots of strips per bag and everyone gobbles them up from 20 lb Cavalier to 55 lb Lab mix.  a repeat purchase.
0,Best wipes for my bulldog's hotspots.
0,excellent quality!  want one in every color!  highly recommend!  I bought two so far, I will probably get my male lab a few more colors.
0,My dog likes three things: pink, balls, and squeakers.  The birthday balls bring all three together in a single toy.  Each pack comes with one ball in each color: pink/yellow, pink/orange, and blue/yellow.  He pretty much ignores the blue one, but he can't get enough of the other two.  Plus, they're much easier to spot in the dog park, so we never lose our squeaky balls any more.  Gone are the days of picking up tennis ball after tennis ball trying to find the one that squeaks.  Now, we can just look for the one that's a different color.  If your dog likes squeaky balls and either has a color preference or likes to play with them at the park, these are the balls for you.
0,Rexie perked up after using it.
0,It works well.
0,my puppy is teething, and will chew on this for at least an hour before she moves on to something else.
0,Bags are hard to open
0,Great for itchy stinky dogs. Helps with itch, and smells so good.
0,These pads are absolutely fantastic. Since having purchased my first one I have purchased many more and use them for all sorts of this. They absorb liquids very well and hold it in as well. They really do help control odor. I like them most as pads for in my dogs kennels especially when they were babies. Will never purchase anything else again these are the best. They also are super easy to clean. If I could give more than five stars I would.
0,I cannot recommended this product highly enough. I own 2 working and sporting Australian Shepherd, 1 sporting Miniature Pinscher, and a Lure Coursing Basenji. This supplement helps with coat shine, reduces shedding, gives added digestive support, and has extra vitamins and minerals that overall help them. Best product I have used for my dogs and they LOVE it. Even my picky one that won't eat hardly anything.
0,Great!
0,Good, kitties love it! Not just for dogs
0,Good for the price if you like cats.
0,I almost didn't buy these because they are made by Pedigree, a company that makes HORRIBLE dog food. but I needed a dental treat other than a cookie type so i bought a pack. I really like the texture! AND the price. I can buy these at petsmart for $3-$4 a bag of 24. When they're on sale that makes them about $0.12 a piece, and at $4 they're about $0.17 each, good deal. My dog prefers the taste to greenies and have about the same ingredients. My dog accumilates plaque at an astounding rate so he gets a dental treat of some sort once a day, not always dentastix but i like this product and i'll continue to rebuy.
0,My cat loves this product. She is a senior kitty who gets cold in the fall/winter months. This is nice because it gives her privacy with the well-constructed hood, is padded, and is very pretty to boot :-) I also added a heating pad underneath the removable bed padding which keeps her nice and warm.
0,This has a great list of ingredients (at least from a human perspective) and smells fresh, but our cats are either set in their ways or prefer foods with grains because they don't like it much. Instead of grains or potatoes it has ingredients like chickpeas, and interesting to me is that it has less protein and more fat than our regular dry cat food.		One other thing about this product--the bag is huge and its stiffness makes it hard to re-seal, so to keep it fresh I think it would be best to move it to another container.
0,We adopted a very thin pup from a shelter promotional event and had to put him on antibiotics to restore him to health.  I had been sifting maybe a half to a teaspoon of this product on his food between his two medication doses and have continued to do this once daily since he finished his treatment.  This seems to be a good product, pup is healthy and happy!
0,I like this seat cover very much. I had to return the extra large as it was too wide for my Chevy Silverado. I got the regular size and it will work fine. It's 2-3" too short on each side so some of the seat is exposed, and there are no side flaps on the smaller size as there were on the extra large one (thus four stars rather  than five.). But it is decent quality and I really like that it doesn't slide around. I laid a lightweight, inexpensive, easy to wash twin comforter on top of it. This way the seat is completely covered, the comforter is easy to haul out and shake sand and dirt out of, and hopefully the mud and dirt will mostly sink into the comforter, which will be easy to wash. Plus, I think any seat cover lasts longer the less you put it through the washer. I'm glad I bought this seat cover.
0,Adorable and vibrant. My only issue is that they place this giant sticker right on the front. The sticker does not come off easily, and even with elbow grease and goo off, it's still sticky. This will, of course, be a cat hair trap. If you're going to place a sticker, make it one that comes off easily...or place it in the backside.
0,The cats play with this toy often. The supplied catnip helps keep there interest.
0,I've been using this for a long time now for my cat, we alternate between chicken and turkey. She eats a dry food along with this wet food daily. I like the small cans, she eats a half can a day - she's a small cat. On some previous foods I had seen her gain too much weight and/or get dry flaky skin. This kitty started life with very delicate health with respiratory infections and tested positive for the feline leukemia virus. Happily she tested negative at 6 months but it's always been important to me to feed her good quality food. She looks healthy and maintains her weight on this food.
0,Love it! Cats do too
0,Put it inside the kennel and it works really well keeps my boy warm while he's snoozing
0,Cheaper that at the Cat shows. Cats love it. Gets them to jumping and good exercise.
0,this are expensive and a very good product.
0,My kittens ate this, but preferred eating other food if given the choice.
0,Silly me! I don't know why I thought this pump would work for my Drinkwell 360 Stainless Steel Pet Fountain. The product description does not say it will. I thought (hoped) all these pet fountains use the same type of pump, but that's incorrect.	So if you're looking for a replacement pump for your Drinkwell 360 Pet Fountain, this is not it. And as far as I can tell, there is no replacement pump for that brand.	The pump arrived packaged well and with thorough directions for placement and use in the Petmate Fresh Flow Fountain.	I'm sure it would be a fine replacement for the correct fountain! =)
0,We've used a variety of leads, harness  and collar combinations over the years and find that a slip lead is the best overall for our needs.		I first noticed the Mendota lead when we brought home our newest rescue and borrowed the lead from the foster family. I'm very impressed with the build quality and ease of use. It's similar to the old style choke chain collars, but is much gentler and is constructed of a strong rope and leather keepers and slides. The slide helps keep the lead from opening too much and makes it less likely that the dog can slip out of the lead easily.		We accidentally purchased the 1/2" model first, but donated it to the rescue organization and bought a couple of the 3/8" models in two different colors.		I'm impressed with products that work as intended and are well made and the Mendota Slip Lead is perfect for our two furry family members.
0,Forti Flora is a wonderful product for our cats.  We used this the first time after our Vet gave us for our oldest cat that has recurring UTI and kidney failure difficulties.  We'd give this  sprinkled on her food to aide with her appetite during and after each antibiotic regimen.  The other two cats get the same. It keeps their appetites and litter box use healthy and regular.  I use Amazon and affiliates for a better price.
0,Keeps car clean and makes dog feel more secure in car
0,He pounced on it upon opening; barely letting me unpack it. He loved it faster than immediately!
0,great
0,The orphan skunks I rescue love this.  No picky eaters so far.
0,Virtually indestructible!!
0,This is probably the cutest thing I've ever seen! I absolutely love it! I ordered a medium and it fits a little big on my 4 lb chihuahua, but that is how I wanted it so she has room to grow in it since she's only 2 1/2 months old. I definitely recommend!!
0,the baby cat loves this; it's her favorite place to Lounge in the living room, ;-D
0,My cat likes these.	And I like the affordable price!		They were all fresh and have stayed fresh and we continue to use them.  Still seems like a good deal now several months after purchase.
0,The dogs all love their nylabones!!!
0,Returned
0,My 2 babies love their bully sticks. My girl does a dance when I get them out
0,Wonderful stuff. It's great peace of mind. A generic of this would be great.  Price is kind of high for this stuff.
0,I really like this scooper. I've left it outside for about a year, in rain, snow, heat, and sun. No issues. It makes keeping the yard clean much easier for me. It's strong enough to pull poop up through the grass if the lawn is a little shaggy, but not so strong that it rips the grass out. It's not very long, but I'm not very tall, so that works out fine for me. Someone who is taller than 5' 7" might want to get a longer scooper so they didn't have to stoop.
0,Great price, product is safe for my bun and my hamster.  Can't beat the free shipping, either.  Came very quickly!
0,Another great dog treat.
0,We built our own cat tree for our cats to climb and tied a few of these 'apples' to the branches for the kitties to play with. They enjoy it and it looks cute. Packed pull of catnip from what I can tell. Very pungent and kitties are definitely drawn to them. When they get one loose from the tree it does roll nicely when batted around.
0,really nice fit for our lab/pit mix.  He's 65+ lbs.  This fits much more comfortably than his last harness.	Stretchy bits on chest also handle pulling much better.	Would recommend.  Would buy again.
0,My dogs love it! we have multiple dog beds but they always go into this one.
0,works great
0,Great product! My dogs love these toys. I have two Pit Mixes and a Boston terrier and these bones really last a long time.  I will say you do need to inspect the toy periodically to be sure no sharp edges have developed. I continue to buy these toys and highly recomend them.
0,My dog love this food just as describe big bag of food fresh am glad I bought this !
0,This thing really scares my cats and I use it to create boundaries in the apartment. Great price for refills.
0,Very sharp, makes trimming the cat's claws fairly easy. It's stayed sharp after many uses, and is comfortable to use.
0,I would recommend.
0,Love Red Dingo products.  Can't go wrong purchasing this brand!!
1,You would get one of what it is placed on the picture, and not way of picking which one. It is somewhat pricy for just one tiny toy, wish I have read other reviews pointing that it was only one toy and not a set, so I could have gotten something else instead of one tiny toy for $6.
1,I bought one of these for my labrador, also got another as a gift. looked like it would be durable, it wasn't. Once a dog gets it in their mouth, it's destroyed and the stuffing is coming out. Other than that, my dog loves it, probably because she can destroy it so quickly.
1,I wish that the little "ramp" where the food falls down into the bowl is a little steeper. Food gets stuck at the ramp and I have to physically stick my finger to have the food come up, which defeats the purpose of this thing.
1,She goobles this food down. The vet has her on a strict diet  so she is always disappointed that there is not more it tastes so  good she lets me  know that. Her coat is shiney and soft. I feel it is a really good food. She is worth whatever I spend on her.
1,I couldn't master the trimmer so I'm still taking my dog to the vet for a nail trim.  Could be the "user."
1,Does not clump well, which meant it did not control odor well either. Had to completely dump the product out and start new with a different product.
1,I have 3 indoor cats who somehow got fleas - has never happened . It did not work at all It is almost as though they have more fleas than they started with . They only had a couple I kept waiting - it did not kill them . had to order advantage
1,This product gave my little Yorkie severe stomach distress.
1,bought the Salmon version, won't buy again. Has been giving my 75lb diarrhea.		update- i had bought the other meat options and haven't had a problem until now...and my lab who eats anything decided he wouldn't eat one specific bag. after looking at other current reviews it seems TotW has had a quality control issue lately that has not been addressed. Had to switch to a different brand to get him to eat it. and there was a noticeable funky smell difference in the stuff i threw out versus the new brand i bought.
1,These don't last long at all.  The tiny LED lights die a bunch at a time. I've purchased five of these hoods and will never buy them again, due to short life of tiny bulbs.		I would go back to fluorescent lighting or try a different brand of LED hoods.		Once the lights on this goes, there's no purpose to  the "hood" you're left with.		This was quite a disappointment. Very much a let down because I'd bought a number of them and now I'm left in the dark.
1,Cheaply made and smaller than expected.  I ordered the large for my English bulldog and it's comparable to trying to use a hand towel as a bath towel.  Doesn't cut it for what we expected.
1,Leaks!
1,I've had this door in place for about 12 years. The door frame is starting to show some wear - chipping off on the bottom edge, lost magnets.  The original flaps lasted for about 8 years, The replacements have always ripped out at the holes within about 18 months.  The holes need to be reinforced somehow to counter the stress of a big dog (60 lb Lab) barreling through the door.  At $30 per flap every 18 months, after 3 flaps, I could nearly replace the entire door. This is not an economical product, but I feel trapped at this point. I have a hole in my door and dogs who need to go outside...		I spent about $14 on a strip of aluminum and a super-super glue, and reinforced the old, holes-ripped-out flap. I think it will work. If it does, for $14, I have enough material to repair 4-5 flaps. I cut the aluminum to the right width, then glued it to the damaged flap. I used a corded drill to drill the holes through the existing holes in the flap to make sure they were in just the right position.  See pics.
1,The leader broke for me within a week!  The lead has a clip that adjusts the tightness of the band that goes around the nose, and it is that clip that broke off.  It is not of good quality and it certainly didn't last.  I'm incredibly disappointed because the product worked really well for my dog.  It is just that this specific product is poorly made.		I wonder if I might have just received a defective product.  But I wouldn't know since they would not allow a return/replacement.  Thus, I cannot recommend that anyone try this.  If you were to get a defective/poorly crafted product like I did, you cannot get your money back!
1,Wasn't true to size
1,This pump is EXTREMELY loud! Very disappointed. DO NOT BUY
1,My Havanese has an 11" necklace. Description says small will fit 11" - 15". That's a huge range, something my numerically challenged brain did not perceive until the collar swam on my dog's neck. Having given a wrong description, the company requires me to pay to return the item. Bad customer service, dishonest business practices.
1,too narrow for Avalanche seats - a momentary challenge to get around for our seat hogs.  Newer cars have very few places to put a hook - these are not elastic and not very long - check your car's seat bottoms to make sure you have a grab point	otherwise, fairly well made and easy to store.
1,This is a huge dog toy, which is nice for my large German Shepherd; but, the squeaker is extremely small.  In fact, it was so small that I could barely find it.  My dog doesn't have interest if he can't squeak his stuffed animals; so, it is just sitting in the floor looking nice.  I wish the squeaker was bigger and positioned in the head of this toy.  Then I would give it 5 stars.
1,The Orioles would not touch this product. So we now have a very pretty hand painted feeder that nothing will feed from.
1,Within an hour my little dog chewed one fin off!	Not that tough, IMHO!
1,I only gave these wipes one star because there isn't an option to rate them any lower!		Don't waste your money on these wipes!  They hardly remove odors, let alone soil or stains.  I used two on a lightly soiled area of my dog's leg and they made no difference at all.  Useless!  There must be a better product than this.
1,A month later it stopped working..I do not recommend this heater just stay with Eheim pay a bit more but will last longer! garbage...
1,Wouldn't fit a small dog let alone a large one!! Apparently repackaged & labeled incorrectly. Do NOT recommend at all.
1,I bought this tank for my betta when I clean their tanks.  I have all my bettas in 10 gallon tanks so they can get lots of exercise.  I don't know how any betta can be kept in this permanently.  I think the least a betta should be in is 2 1/2 gallons.  They are horizontal swimmers so they do need space to swim.  But it is a good holding tank when I need it for a short period of time.
1,Too bulky, easy to open and close but took up way too much room had to send back
1,UPDATE 2-16-2014	This went from a 5 start to a 2 star per my two cats. They do not eat this anymore even when begging to be fed.. I did not downgrade to a one star because I think the food is high in protein so if your cat likes it, stick with it. I do notice my cats drinking more water after they eat this. The salt content must be higher than the norm for cat foods.		*************	If you own a cat, you will get what I am about to write. My cats love any canned food when they first try it. It's novel and new and tastes better than what they currently have. The problem is that the fifth or sixth time they are given the same food, they start to complain, walking away with their noses up. Now because they are cats, they eventually nibble, but I end up throwing away a lot of food. They always go back to Fancy Feast. My vet has told me that FF is not bad for younger cats. It has more protein than some, but also lots of carbs. So I switched to a brand named Evolve. My vet gave that the high five-lots of protein. It has been 5 weeks of Evolve, and they are tiring of it. I am slowly weaning them off Fancy Feast too.		Now comes Pride-tuna. They absolutely love this. Both my 11 and 12 year old cats inhale this. Will it last? I don't know. I am alternating FF and Pride with my finicky boy, and Evolve and Pride with my girl who must be off Fancy Feast for health reasons. She absolutely needs the extra protein and is having trouble now digesting FF.		I think that this cat food may be the one. It is steeped in gravy which they love. Is shredded rather than ground, easier to swallow for them. And they do not hesitate to dig in.		Changing cat food is always dicey. A food like Pride, which lists not only protein such as tuna and pork as it lead ingredients, but all natural food after that, is a must for cats especially older ones who cannot digest the carbs. Cats are animals that naturally need protein. It prevents all kinds of illnesses( I have owned cats for over 40 years). Switching to a pricier protein diet like Pride(or Evolve) is a no brainer if you want your cat to live longer. Would you let your child eat at McDonalds every day if she refused to eat anything else?
1,Did not work for my dog - it was too long. I bought it for my 52 lb pit bull and her little head was so far down in this thing - like looking down a hole at her face, poor girl. We took it right off of her and used the one the vet gave us for her until we could get one of the blue blow-up doughnut type ones.
1,I bought this for my puggle puppy when she was five months old after my friend mesmerized her with a simple laser pointer.		PRO:	You can set it on and leave it. It moves around in a circular motion with sporadic changes in direction.	You can adjust the radius up and down.		CONS:	It isn't loud, but loud enough to make my pup look towards the sound instead of the laser.	Tends to retrace it's path.	Need a large empty space or it will go on areas that are not accessible and the pup got bored.	Pup was over it after two months of sporadic use.		It kept my pup's attention only a few times, after that she was bored with it. More work, but I think buying a cheap laser pointer and moving it around is the way to go. Will give this to a friend with a cat, maybe they are entertained by this longer than my pup.
1,It was huge.
1,My hearing impairment made this a non-starter.  However, my dog did try to use it.
1,They bend really easy.
1,Too stiff. Not comfortable to hold.
1,First the fact that they picture 3 makes you think you are getting 3.  You get 1.  My cat sniffed it & left it alone.  I sprayed cat nip spray on it & still no interest.  It's very large for a cat toy.  Glad it wasn't too expensive!
1,Way too small to be considered extra large, couldn't get it over my dogs head	I am getting a puppy soon will use it for her, also cheaply made
1,sure hiope the cat is not afraid of the alomost black cat litter.cat does  not like this dark dark color!!
1,Tablets way too big.
1,Never had problems with frontline before but after noticing a return of fleas I began treating the cats with frontline as it had rid them of fleas before.  After 3 months of treatment the fleas not only didn't go away but had gotten much worse.  We got them other treatments and they are getting better now.  Not sure why the frontline has stopped working but it doesn't seem to have the potency it once did. This was a huge waste of money.
1,The size 1 is too small & the size 2 is too big.  I wish the straps were velcro.  The buckle & strap are difficult to use especially for the over the head strap.  Also the loop for the collar needs to be larger.  I use the quick release Martingale with the buckle.
1,We ordered this trailer because of product reviews and that most we looked at in person were pretty much junk although they did cost a lot less. We received the item missing an axle bolt and one of the axle welds is bad. The weld has already started cracking and while the axle bolt is an odd length I managed to make a replacement part. I don't want to send the thing back because it's a good sized box so I'll probably fix the weld too....but I shouldn't have to do that.		Also, the tires are pretty bad. They almost look and feel like plastic and the smell is terrible. They don't smell like normal rubber tires. They actually smell like gasoline which tells me that the cheap plastic look is appropriate because it's a lousy tire.		For the price quality should be better and God forbid, would it kill a company to actually make something in the US...or at least North America? At the price I didn't expect the same lower quality we were seeing in person (but for less money).  Really tired of all the low grade Chinese made goods.
1,Waste of money, the zipper came off in few days. Also too small
1,The cats love these adorable toys but they fell apart in less than one week.  I am finding parts all over.  Were these made in China?  The many other Petstages toys that are used and loved by my two cats are high quality and some even non-toxic.  I try to stay away from products made in China.
1,My dog doesn't even go near these pads, so much for the attractant - waste of my money!  Do not buy..
1,My Betts got over to each other's sides the first night. There is a gap in both sides of the divider they can fit through. I'm sure I'm going home to dead fish because I had to leave for work without a solution to fix it. I don't know how long they where together last night but they are beat up. So disappointed. Otherwise the tank itself is okay so far. Pretty nice. Just not for 2 Bettas.
1,There was a tear in the left side of the jacket
1,My rats do not like them at all
1,This is a cute idea. Unfortunately, it is extremely hard to put together and constantly is falling apart.
1,both of my dogs got allergies from these bully sticks. Both dogs are itching like crazy, first started with the shaking of the ear then scratching all over. Took them to the vets and finally got it narrowed down to these. Not good at all.
1,1) the clipper is not wrap in good condition.	2) the clipper's blade got hair residue left inside and outside	3) the clipper's body clearly is not new and I see some cleaning agent spots on it	4) of cause brand new item shouldn't have finger print on the clipper.	5) I paid for a new product price but I wouldn't use any 2nd hand merchandise unless specified
1,Had it throw it out as it got rusted almost immediately. Look at my other purchase the the red bowl, it is perfect.
1,My dogs stripped off the green covering in about 15 minutes.  The rope was gone in a day
1,Thumper kind of liked it
1,Don't clip this to your bag with the very small loop. It will break and fall off and you will have no more collapsible port-a-bowl. I have no idea what the point of the small loop is if you can't clip it to anything without it breaking.
1,Just search google for the hazards pork bones cause to your dog. My dog loves these bones the best but now I will have to find a safer alternate...
1,On the Amazon page I ordered this cat food from, the ingredients listed did not match the ingredients on the bag I received.  The bag I got lists Menadione Sodium Bisulfite in the ingredients.  This has been proved to cause cancer in cats.  Look it up.
1,Cats don't like it. They just lick the gravy.
1,The plastic aquarium plant dcor started falling apart from the moment I unwrapped it. pieces were falling off like it was brittle. It was not the parts that you can just snap back together but rather stems and leaves that broke off. I think it may have either been real old, exposed to too much heat or cold or just been a bad batch from manufacture. Either way I had to return as it looked bare after all the breakage.
1,My small RES have no interest in climbing the plank to bask. I used dried shrimp to lure them up and they had no problem climbing the plank upwards to get the shrimp, and then they'd scurry down to eat the shrimp in the water. When the food was gone, they'd just float in the water and not go back up to bask. Maybe mine aren't the brightest RES...
1,Followed instructions, did not work and could not stand the smell. I attempted applying a few times, just in case, and still failed results, and hated the scent.
1,I'm really, really surprised that this item got so many good reviews because the one I got was a piece of crap! We assembled the Multi-Level Cat Climber according to the instructions and the assembly video (esmartcat.com), but it took more than three people to properly assemble the climber (including one engineer!). The screws/nuts/washers that keep the shelves attached to the base did not properly fit the divets, so the shelves literally sag and droop and, ultimately, making the platform unsteady and unsafe for my 9 pound cat. The "adjustable" metal back piece had an oddly placed screw in the center that interfered with the embedded spring that made moving and adjusting the height nearly impossible, preventing the tension necessary to keep the cat climber snugly against the door. Shoddy craftsmanship for $69.99!!! :(
1,My dog got sick after taking this.  It was so bad it made her have blood in her stool.  Had to put her on antibiotics and bland diet for 10 days.  This was the only new food product introduced that week.  Threw out the rest.
1,my pup had diarrhea due to stomach virus and vet has recommended this but it made him worst!	So don't buy whole pack, try with a few and see if will help your dog.
1,doesn't keep them calm as it was meant to, I have 3 nervous car riding pups, one has a different vest, the 2 that have this product was still a nervous reck, will see how they do for the 4th coming up
1,It grew fast, but then so did the mold. Didn't last long, but it did the cats liked it.
1,It's not that I don't like it. My cats don't like it. They aren't stepping foot into it.
1,Recommended pads don't fit the frame. I returned it.
1,Good for playing fetch but I wouldn't leave it laying around as a chew toy.  The felt doesn't seem to last very long if left unsupervised.
1,very hard to see which part of the nail you're clipping using the clipper, actually caused bleeding. I have a flat pair of scissors that did a much better job. I would return it had it not be for the electric filer
1,I have bought this in hope my cat would drink it neither one of them did it so it want to waste. I wished company like that would make it with a better scent so animal will eat it instead of frowning at it. If anyone has a better luck good for them
1,I recently bought this to replace an older version. It is too flimsy and I can't throw the ball nearly as far. Bummed.
1,I found these to be a real hassle to use and went back to the dollar store plastic ones.  The problem was holding onto the leash and trying to unzip the pouch and roll out a bag.......the whole roll comes out when you unzip the pouch. Then you have to put the roll back in the pouch and zip back up. I prefer to use the dollar store fire hydrant ones because I can just pull out one bag at a time. This was non refundable so I guess Ill donate it.
1,junk
1,I have bought this a couple of times because my cat liked it. I was shocked to read the misleading information and will not purchase from this company again.  It says "no ground corn or fillers."  Well the second ingredient listed is Corn Gluten Meal.  That is a "filler" and is made from the leftovers from processing corn into syrup...the same high fructose corn syrup we know is bad for us.  It acts as a binder and raised the amount of protein in the food.  But cats have to eat twice as much corn to get the equivalent protein as in poultry or meat.  Many cats have problems digesting corn or are allergic to it.	Bad enough to have it in the food but the fact it is the second ingredient listed shows a high content. Also I noticed that there is no carbohydrate percentage listed, which seems odd considering the corn, rice, etc.	I will not be buying this food again.  It may or may not be harmful and no worse than some other cheaper brands, but the fact it said "no fillers" when there most definitely is one was misleading.  I take some of the blame for not reading all the information and only reading  the "headlines."
1,I have never left one star for a product, but this was a pure waste of money.  Sure, the pump works when plugged in, but is soooooo weak when it switches to battery that it will not even run one hose, let alone the two it allows.  Just hums quietly and no bubbles.  It only has maybe 2.5 feet to travel from the stand up to the tank.  I purchased brand new Duracell batteries for it so I know that's not the issue.  Unfortunately too late to return since we bought it as a safety back up for a two week vacation and didn't notice the issue till the night before we left when I did a water change on the tank.  Save your money and just buy a computer battery back up for your power heads instead.
1,sending back too hard
1,My two Cockapoos hated these!!! Plastic that is not edible is wrapped around a bone shaped material.  They totally hated it...my dogs usually enthustically love every treat given to them! Don't waste your money!!!
1,My dog is a small breed, under 30 pounds.	I ordered per the sizes on the post and when it came it still looked like it would fit a toy dog.	No zipper, no elastic, no give no easy way to pull it on or off your dog's head.	I immediately sent it back.
1,Maybe it would loosen up eventually. But I can't deal with it till then. It's in the garbage.
1,It is a lot smaller than what is shown, obviously.  there's no navy piping around the edge, and the color is a dark cool taupe, not a light khaki.	We did order this in large after we realized how very small the medium is, and the large looks exactly like as advertised.
1,Impossible to tell size.
1,not happy with those things. I think I am better off with using kitchen trash bags like I was using all this time. not happy with this at all
1,Made my dogs throw up every time. Even after eating these with food
1,2pc rubber is way too floppy, tines are extremely sharp and scratches the skin badly. I need to throw this out and go back to my old source for a grooming slicker.
1,Harness would have been ok but the stitching at the edge of the neck area split on 2nd day, rendering the harness useless.  Poor manufacturing quality.
1,My dog won't eat them. Can't say anything about their effectiveness on account of how she spits them out as soon as they hit her tongue. Full disclosure, she is on thyroid meds and has to take pills morning and night so she tends to be a little wary of new "treats". That being said, I am the primary meds dispenser and so she usually takes things without complaint from my hubby, guess again! She says, "no bueno dad, not happenin'!" My daughters' dogs will eat anything (including socks and dryer vents) so these will go straight to her house, they will get slicked up there no doubt!
1,Doesn't fly well at all
1,The bowl is rather small for the size of the outer dimension. Plus the rubber gasket comes off easily ... we ended up just tossing the rubber part out.
1,I was really hoping my senior kitty would like these as much as the regular nu-cat supplements which he loves and I have given him as a 'treat', but, these are a different formula/flavor and too hard for him to chew which was very disappointing. He also doesn't seem too thrilled about the smell because they don't have the beefy-livery scent like the non-senior nu-cat supplement pills. At first, he tried a few times to chew the pills and often the pill would fall out of his mouth because he couldn't crush it in his mouth.		So, I've decided to grind these pills up in my spice grinder and add 1/4 teaspoon to his wet food each day instead, but, after he's gone through this supplement I am switching him back to the regular nu-cat pills which he goes crazy for.
1,Like many others here, I thought the SmartCat Climber looked like a great addition to my home. I am sorry to say that the design is flawed and the quality is not what it should be, given the price tag.		Pros:	+ Looks nice (at first) and doesn't take up space.		+ My cats enjoy hopping up on it now and then, though not as often as they did when I first set it up. I see one of the cats on it maybe once every couple of days.		+ Provides a place to put a food bowl where the dog can't get to it. I think the food bowl is the only reason the cats bother to use it anymore.		Cons:	- Bangs against the door when cats jump on it, and the sound is loud enough to wake me up in the middle of the night. As others have noted, you can dampen this sound to some degree by reinforcing the connections between the pieces, but it's still a bad design. For $80, it should work without any modifications.		- Metal piece on the top of the door scrapes against the door molding and makes it hard to open/shut the door completely. This isn't a huge deal because it's installed on a seldom-used closet door, but if your doorway doesn't leave much room between the door and molding, and you open/close the door frequently, you'll probably have the same problem.		- And by far my biggest complaint: the material used for the perches/levels is falling apart less than a year after I bought it. My cats don't use the vertical sisal-covered planks to scratch because there's not enough room between the perches/levels for them to stretch--they scratch the horizontal perches, which clearly were not designed for this purpose. The cheap, fuzzy material covering these is coming up all over the place. Why would the manufacturer cover the perches on a cat tree in a material that doesn't stand up to being scratched by cats?		I would have given this a 3-star review if the issue was just some minor design issues, but an $80 product should not be in such poor shape after less than one year of light use. For comparison, I bought a much larger ~$100 Amarkat tree at the same time I purchased the SmartCat Climber. The Amarkat is still in great shape, and I have no complaints about it.		I can't recommend the SmartCat Climber to anyone with cats who have claws. It's a nice idea, but the design is mediocre and the product has not lasted.
1,This stuff smells like cough syrup fir half an hour and then fades to nothing.
1,I love all the tubes and extra pieces but the wheel is a problem. We have a dwarf hamster. The opening for the enclosed wheel is at the bottom, but the wheel we got does stay very steady, so it rolls over when the hamster gets in. Hence, the opening is now at the top, which means he can't get back out. We were worried about this and on the first night I woke up hearing our little guy running on it, so I ran down to check on him. He was indeed stuck and looked like he was exhausted and scared. He basically kept running and running because he could never get up high enough to get back to the opening. We have not played with it to see if there is another fix, but the rest is cool.
1,First the chime worked really well. My dog learned to use it in 2 days, I was so happy about that success. After three weeks the chime was malfunctioning, it went off all the time without reason. Big disappointment!!!!
1,We have five cats and every one of them refused to eat this food.  They are not picky eaters and will typically devour any cat food you put in front of them, but not this one.  I gave up after several weeks of trying and will throw away the rest of the bag.  An expensive mistake!
1,My puppy destroyed this within the first 15 minutes of playing with it
1,My lab heeler mix had bone splinters chewed off within in the hour so I tossed it in the trash. Seemed like it was very dry and brittle especially the marrow so maybe that is why it splintered.  She is only 45 pounds but is an aggressive chewer. Don't waste your money.
1,Bought this pump to power a counter current protein skimmer and the pump malfunctioned after the first full day of use.  Only one of the outputs works barely enough to hold me over until another one arrives in shipping.  not recommended.
1,My dogs do not like this bone
1,Shocking difference, decrease in the quality of the Halo Liv-a Little treats I just received. The dry treats break apart and become  instead of chunks. My current jar has nice big chunks with very little powder in the jar while the new jar has much smaller pieces and lots of powder. Both purchased on Amazon. See photos. These treats are not cheap. The same thing happened with the chicken treats I got at the same time but the difference between my last order and my new jar is not as dramatic as with the salmon. Smaller pieces are newest jar.
1,not very durable for a heavy chewer like my labradoodle, and a must supervise toy
1,Pet door arrived promptly.  Packaging was in excellent condition.  Installation was easy.  Total time including both getting and putting tools used away, 60 minutes.  Only annoyance is that since we live in a windy location, the flaps sometimes get noisy.  I intend to add some magnets to overcome this (I hope)
1,cheaply made
1,My dog has tear stains (caused by yeast and other things) and itches a lot, despite the fact that he is on a holistic diet, no fleas, has a soft hair coat and no visible skin issues.		I bought this in hopes of helping my dog with the itchies.  After 3 weeks on it and seeing ZERO results I contacted the company, which was difficult.  Their website is down and I had to do an internet search to find their number.		I called and asked when I should see results.  They had NO CLUE.  It was if I was calling the Post Office asking them about the product.  They read from the bottle and said it depends on the dog.  I told them my dog had been on it for 3 weeks.  I also asked if it was a bad idea for me to give my dog a product with yeast when he has an issue with yeast (tear stains).  They said it was a different kind of yeast.  I have no idea if that is true, but because they could not offer me any real information, I highly dout that comment is true.		I quit giving to my dog.
1,My cat really loves this toy however since I first started buying them I've had to replace it three times. And I just ordered two more. String is easily unraveled and the second piece of the toy comes off  frequently.
1,The button to stop the leash from going out is hard to use, as is the clasp that hooks to the collar. I bought a "good for up to 50lbs" for my 25lbs terrier, as she loves trying for squirrels. The 5th time I take the dog out, the leash snaps off from inside the plastic hold!! BAD
1,way too big and the dogs can back out of them
1,I used this on my dogs this year and it did absolutely no good. Two weeks after application I found tics on both dogs, not just dead dried up tics, but ones that were alive and swollen up with blood. I called the company and was given some of the most ridiculous excuses. I was told that I should have bathed the dogs a week after application, the lady said that I should have also treated my yard and inside my house. I have used this product in the past and it worked, but not this year, this year nothing, a complete waste of money. Do you think they offered to replace the product? Heck no, and the lady even had the nerve to act offended when I suggested it. I will never waste my money on this again. I got Pet Armor and it works great.
1,seems very cheaply made, the sides were hard to snap into place, and was way too long for what I needed. I do not think you get your money's worth in this product, I ultimately returned it because it was too long for the space I had.
1,Smaller then the measurements not a macaw cage as stated, no paper work with it, had to guess how it went  together.
1,Did not help my cat.  Mostly just very hard to apply to cats because application is time consuming and I like to be done with whatever I'm doing before they have a chance to argue much.
1,My cats are absolutely not interested in this toy.  I tried for months, with toys and treats.  They ignore both.  Simply don't like it.
1,The dog wasn't a fan of the ball. The way it rolls no food comes out unless he starts flinging it around the house or its very very full. I'm K out a fan if all the stickers. If you're going to plaster your product in the at least make them easy to remove. It seems durable at least, but we've only just gotten it so we'll update as we go.
1,This used to be a stellar product. Recently they caved and started HPP of their grinds (the raw bar items are still good as far as I know, it's just the grinds) tanking the nutritional value. It was one of very few convenient options for raw feeders; now it's not an option at all. I would like to find any non-HPP bags that are left, but they don't even label that they made the change. Also concerning, if they thinks it's a good thing like they are saying (it's not), why hide the ball?? I did get a bag recently and my discerning pup who used to love the stuff, won't touch it. :(
1,The tips are small for Poodles mouth.
1,Doesn't work at all on howling or whining.  I get a puzzled head tilt when I push the button but nothing to indicate she doesn't like it or that it's negative reinforcement.
1,This is pretty but thin and SEVERAL inches SMALLER than listed. Wish I could return.
1,Did not work for my dog. She sure did like the extra snack
1,Smells better than the other one we were using so that's an improvement.  Dog coat was left shiny and soft.		Edit:  I gave our friend's dog a bath following a muddy day in the yard, and it made her break out in scratchy patches all over.  I don't feel ok using this anymore after seeing what happened to her.
1,These don't stay in the litter box because they all get scooped away by my automated litter box. Nice scent though.
1,This is product is for CATS only!  I guess I didn't read the fine print.  It says"For Use in Cats Only" on the label.  I bought it because of the comments on here that people gave it to their dogs..... :-(
1,None of my 5 cats will touch them
1,My dog love's these. However Amazon can't get them to my house without at least 2 of the 3 chews broken into multiple pieces too small for my dog. I am afraid she will choke on them. I don't know if the problem is with the manufacturer or Amazon, but I am so frustrated by this.
1,I have been loyal to Precious Cat litter for over 5 years. Im so angry that they changed the formula this year. Its completely useless now: odor control is worse, and it doesnt absorb moisture so it tracks more. Worst of all: it is now Impossible to scoop! Turns into wet cement consistency that we had to use an old spatula to remove (good thing I was already throwing one away!!)		Please, someone tell me what kind to switch to! I tried Worlds Best and it is GROSS. Smells before your cat even does their business.
1,My dog did not like this food, I gave it to the pound.
1,There must be some sort of dye in it, as our pups poops where the exact same light brown color as the food and very runny. Switched to another brand and they look normal again. The ingredient list looks good, so maybe it is just my dogs reaction.
1,My cats hate this. Well, hate is a strong word I suppose. They just don't like it and attempted to play with it for about 5 seconds before giving up and going back to their other toys. I replaced this hard ball with a ping pong ball and they seemed to enjoy that more but the ping pong ball doesn't stay in the track since it is smaller so after a little while they were able to just pop the ping pong ball out of the track and now it doesn't matter if there is a track or not.		I also didn't like that there are so many extra pieces that I have to keep track of when not in use. I know that is because it can change shapes but why not just make all the shapes use all the pieces?		Bulky and a waste of money as far as my cats and I are concerned.
1,The description states it can handle dogs up to 75 pounds. Well my 64 pound dog took one step in this and it fell apart. The worst part is that she just had surgery on her leg. When the stairs collapsed, she hurt her leg.		I would not recommend this product for a medium to large dog.
1,hmmmmmmm
1,Not the best . Just pulls hair
1,Pretty annoying, go the Kong Wobbler. Takes forever to load with dry food because of the small hole.
1,This was done in 10 minutes. My puppy is 11 months old and weights 91 pounds Golden.
1,My puppy does not pay attention to this one. I don't know if it's because it doesn't squeak or what? I t thought it would help him with his teething, but he never did anything after I took it out of the package. He sniffed it, put it in his mouth once, and that was it.
1,I ordered this as extra & recieved it on time & at door. When I opened the cans my cats were READY! BUT, what came out was a mushy mess & the cats even knew something wasent right! Some gave it a shot , then quickly walked away! Others won't touch it ( & I don't blame them!) . I have this brand on sub & save & I have used it for a year or so, NEVER have I had this issue. Still a total waste & now I have to 1-2 day order More, a different flavor I think! Not happy !
1,I gave my dog a bath with this product and he came very itchy... he started losing hair on his back and I immediately stopped using it. Needless to say, his hair has grown back and we are no longer using this shampoo.
1,This container was great at first but not really worth it in the end. I have had it about 6 months and wasn't having any problems.... until I started to have bugs in my apartment. The smaller, baby roaches found there way under the lid and through the supposedly "air tight" seal. I hate to give it a bad name because it was working so well for me but honestly you should look elsewhere. Sorry!
1,My cat lost interest VERY quickly :(
1,Our Guinea Pig didn't even try them...
1,Do not hold on my puppies feat for more than 1.5 minutes. The velcro closings rip off easily. Really not worth a penny.
1,Too small. I measured my dog's neck & bought according to size but way too small Better luck next time
1,The smell was way too much for me!
1,Awful.
1,Sent it back, it didn't make it through the day.  This is Kong, I expect better, it's made of what I thought would be sturdy material but my dogs pierced through it in no time and tore it.  I had other cheaper plush toys last longer.
1,My bird has chewed on the wood a bit but never really got on the swing. Of course, maybe that's because it's not anywhere near as big as the photo shows. I actually have a Senegal -- the green and yellow bird in the product photo -- and the chains are nowhere near long enough for him to sit on it like that. He would almost touch his head on the top of his cage if he sat on it. So, the photo is very misleading. Clearly someone just added the bird in Photoshop. Finally, the photo doesn't show how it's actually put together. The wood runs in the other direction so that the bird would have to straddle two pieces to actually sit on the swing, instead of sitting on one pice. Oddly, the photo shown on my order page is more accurate. Most birds want to face away from the chains when they swing. I've added the photo that shows up on my order page. I'll try to remember to get a photo of the one I got and add it later.		Mostly, I just wish sellers would show honest photos about how big things are, because it really does matter. And use proper materials that won't potentially kill my bird.
1,My dogs loved these treats!!  Recently my 9 yr old hound that has never been to the vet got sick.  Couldn't keep anything down and after 3 days of this we went to pet emergency.  $1200.00 later it was concluded that it was something digested.  Not possible, I spare no expense when it comes to my 3 furry buddy's!  I grabbed the bags of treats and sure enough, MADE IN CHINA.  Went to FDA web site in 2012 and they said chicken from CHINA bad but no recalls yet.  DOGS have been getting sick from chicken products from china, advised not to buy.  Called company and no return call.	Trashed them all!!
1,We have a Chihuahua and she loved playing with this toy. The only problem is that after about 3 weeks she already ripped off the ears on almost all of the squirrels and slightly ripped open the base (which has some hard cardboard).		It's a cute and entertaining toy, but it's very important that you watch your pet while they play. That's supposed to be the rule with toys... but let's just say that you've been warned!
1,NOT worth the $$$.to me this should be a dollar.very small and head does not stay on at all.
1,Was only able to use this twice before the clasp broke. VERY thin cheep plastic. Never again. Better quality plastic should be used for a product that is meant to hold a dog in check when on a leash.
1,Was not happy with this product it didn't control the  odor very well.
1,This an add on product is ridiculous. I might eventually find a use for these brushes, but it certainly won't help me clean the fountain these were linked to as the brushes are larger than the fountain, let alone the internal plumbing.
1,My 9 month old French Bulldog tore up her newest bed in just minutes.  So much for chew guard.
1,I bought this to mix things up after using the beef Sojos for a couple of months. I mix it in with dry food. If this is in it they won't touch their bowl. It's heavy on grains, unlike the other flavors which include a lot of veggies.
1,This seems like a good idea but the suctions do not stick to the window for too long and are forever falling off. My cats do not want to use it. Hope someone else has good luck using this product. Did not work for us. Should have returned!
1,These smell terrible and are billed as "hypoallergenic."  Unfortunately, duck is poultry just like chicken, so for dogs with chicken allergies, this is still no help.
1,I bought this to hold millet sprays as a treat for my pair of zebra finches.  This morning, I was horrified to find my male finch had died after getting stuck in this feeder.  The top is quite wide (compared to a finch head) and while there is a horizontal bar that's supposed to keep this from happening, that bar is not secure.  My poor bird must have fallen in head first overnight, struggled and got his wing stuck between the vertical bars. I don't know if he suffocated on the millet, had a heart attack, or just too much pressure from being upside down.  I found him trapped inside this deathtrap this morning.  I could not extricate him from the feeder.  My poor female is totally tramatized and hasn't made a peep all day.  Please do no buy this for small birds.  This was just horrific.
1,I sort the product list by the word "natural" when I buy dog treats.  This came out as one of the selections so I bought it.  I opened the package and gave some of the treat to my dogs and I looked up the package. There I found this product is no good.  Even though it says 100% natural duck, it does not show ingredients list, which I believe it is required by American law.  "LAB TESTED IN THE U.S.A." print was just a paper sticker.  Most scary thing is the package says "Not for human consumption.  Wash hands with soap and water after handling."  What kind of dangerous material is in the product???  This product is from China.  I am not a bias person, but I hear so many cases from the news (back in my country) reporting the illegal meat manufacturer got into the food supply chain selling dead meat mixed with good meat, meat from the animal that died from sickness, etc... I threw away this product still with a full of the treats.  I am not sure if Amazon has some kindly quality control about what is sold in their website...
1,my cats are petrified. otherwise it would probably be great.
1,He won't eat it until he is very hungry and then it makes him sick.  Gives him the runs.  Interesting, since he eats everything else.  Trees, branches, birds, poops of all kinds, rotten compost stuff. . . But of all things, the thing I paid a ridiculous amount for makes him sick. I can't imagine what is in this stuff. :)
1,Way, way, way too tiny.  Size recommendations way off.	Threw it away.  Return would cost me more than the harness.
1,flimsy, unrealistic and pro quality overall.  It was returned.
1,Not much you can say about a cat tree.  It was frieght damaged when we got it but we were able to glue the piece back together.  Just hope it holds.  Not the quality of Armakat.  Actually the B7701 and B7801 in the Armakat are my favorites.  I have 12 cats so I know my cat trees.  My cats love it but they love all their cat trees.  I have 4 in the house and 2 on the porch.  I'm going to stick to the Armakat in the future.		OK - UPDATE.  This is completely trashed.  It is such thin particle board that some of it completely collapsed.  Will never buy anything but Armakat from now on.  In all these years I have never had anything happen to one of theirs.  More expensive but at least its not a waste of money.
1,My cat hated this thing and kept sliding out of it. It would not stay on him. Not sure if that's how all cat harnesses are but it didn't work out so we had to return.
1,Too big and bulky for small dogs. No ce quality but too big for little dogs
1,If you're used to baby wipes or even the wet toilet paper wipes these will disappoint they're very dry and have little cleaning ability because of that. I'll probably just buy a cheap brand of baby wipes. Not worth the money.
1,This made my dog vomit. It also made her food smell like rotten milk. Bleh
1,My dog wouldnt eat it with the shell on.  I have to put it in a pill pocket in order to get him to eat it.  The shell is very hard too, it is impossible to open by just twisting it.  After open with a pair of scissors, there were just 3 or 4 drops of oil.  I wonder if the suggested intake amount is enough.
1,This has no effect on either of my cats? Strangely brown in color. I have purchased the catnip by this brand and it was good but this spray is no good.
1,This brand is the cheapest of the good cat food I could find on amazon but the quality from when I first ordered a box has gone down. Especially for this flavor. The contents are mushy to the extreme and my cat has to force himself to eat it most of the time, or I have to force him because I don't have anything else to give him. I couldn't put him through this anymore, luckily I found some at Trader Joe's for cheaper and he likes those a lot more than this. Another thing that frustrates me is the constant price change.
1,This spray basically just momentarily covers cat odor with a baby-powdery perfume, after it dried it did little to actually remove any cat smells from my couch.
1,Pads are much smaller compared to any other regular pads. 2 of these pads equal about 1 regular size pad. Was debating for while before buying it. I will not buy this again.
1,Product was received broken.
1,Great product, really works.
1,My cat did not take kindly to having his litter changed. I know he's a bit finicky, so I tried mixing this in with his current litter, and he pee'd in my foyer. I added more of his regular litter and, while he DID use it, I could tell he didn't like it.		Another problem for me was scooping. The pellets are so big that when I would go to scoop his box, my scoop was filled with all the pellets, even if they weren't soiled! This seems like a huge waste of perfectly good litter. I don't want to play around in the litter box making sure I get ONLY the soiled litter on my scoop...I scoop, I shake, I discard. The end.		My cat was happy though cause after a few days of cleaning his box, I had pretty much scooped out all the pellets and he was back to just his regular litter. While I would love to have less dust and littler on the floor, the high cost of this just isn't worth it to me. That and the cat seriously hated it. The unused portion of my box went into the trash
1,Sorry but African Dwarf Claw foot frogs will not eat these. I just had one frog die I guess from starvation!  So order the frozen blood worms or re-hydrate some tubiflex worms for them instead.
1,Just received 2 of these balls today.  My 6 month German Shepherd who weighs 40lbs just destroyed this ball in less than 3 min.  Don't waste your money.
1,EDIT: I set it up on my kitchen counter on top of a towel and within twenty minutes it was drenched. Looking closer, it was leaking continually from the seam which caused it to keep over filling the bowl.		After one year it started over flowing water everywhere (filling water way beyond the threshold and spilling out). Water got under the floor and warped a big chunk of my brand new wood flooring before I realized what was happening. We kept it on concrete but the water went under the threshold into another room and under the wood floors. Would not recommend for indoor use.
1,Very disappointed in this product.  I bought this cage to temporarily house a trap-neuter-release (TNR) cat I will be moving from one location to another.  Need a secure cage to allow the cat to acclimate to his new surroundings.  The cage came with a broken and deeply scratched base pan (took pictures to send to vendor).  It almost looks like the pen was returned and then the company sent it to me  zip ties were cut, tags were removed, and scratches in areas that appeared as if someone tried to put it together, and a number of the rubber caps on the cut cage ends are missing.  I did not order nor pay for a second-hand cage.  Product is flimsy and was awkward to assemble.  The three landings provided for cats to sit on, once connected to the interior of the pen, were not very secure and bounced easily to the touch.  We had to use zip-ties to secure them in place.  I would return this cage but it was such a pain to assemble I don't want to waste my time disassembling it and trying to get it back into the box and then the trouble of returning it.  This may be the Vendors business paradigm  hmmm?  We bought another two-tier pen from another vendor (via Amazon) and that two-level cage was actually quite nice, easy to assemble, and sturdy so I was expecting something almost as nice since I was paying more for the cage.  So, at the end of all of this frustration  I would not recommend this product for purchase.
1,Not one of my four cats will eat this food. I have two 14+ years and two 4 yr olds and all 4 have not eaten any of the bowl of food left out for them.
1,The guy at the kennel we leave our dogs at when we vacation highly recommended these. He said he hadn't used them, but several clients swore by them.		We switched from the Grass Saver Biscuits (which worked well) to just these to see if a more cost-effective method would keep our grass looking just as good. The issues we have had with these is that they just aren't as good. Especially with our female dog, once we switched over, we started getting yellow spots again. The rocks were in their only water source as recommended.		The other issue was that our smaller dog loves to steal them out of the water. I have left them in the water because I guess it can't hurt, but we started them back on the Grass Saver treats and now the lawn is going back to green. You have to replace them often enough, I just can't see the draw.
1,I have never purchased this before, so I thought it was a good deal. Most Amazon Prime items are. Turns out you can buy this for 21$ at Sams/ Same exact thing. Not free shipping at all. Would never buy this again. The cat food was okay if you don't mind getting really ripped off.
1,My dog has no interest in these.  He smelled them, tried chewing them and then whined.  I don't like the way they break apart if a larger dogs bites on them.
1,I am not impressed with this collar. I had bought one from the vet that worked great and thought I could save some money on this one, the powdery stink was terrible. I would not recommend this at all.
1,Battery easily falls out, light breaks. But product is cool for the few days it lasts
1,But break in 2 weeks or less.  Not worth the high  price.
1,My cat sniffed it and walked away
1,Filter arrived broken and I had to send it back
1,The concept is a good one - elevated food dishes for the health of your pet.  The material and construction of it is poor.  I bought 2 singles for 2 dogs rather than the double one for food and water; they already share a different water dish.  The singles were easy to pack, both the stand and the dish fold completely flat. But the legs were stiff and didn't fold very well the first few times, on the 4th time, the plastic snapped unfixable.  The bowls are ok though.
1,Too hard. All 3 dogs choked on these when I handed them out. If you don't like your dog, this is perfect. Otherwise, skip this treat.
1,Don't buy, doesn't work
1,Worked well for a few weeks. But collar stopped working though everything showed as charged. Tried to reset everything, made no difference. Shock was also inconsistent based on position of collar on neck.
1,She'll take a few laps, and then she won't touch the rest of it.  And if you leave it, it will mold over after several hours.  Eeeww!  It's an interesting idea, and would be good for dogs in warmer climates after a long bout of exercise.  But if your dog doesn't drink it all at one time, then you have to worry about storing it so it doesn't go bad.  And considering it's about a buck-fifty a packet, you certainly don't want to just throw it out!		For me, the value isn't there.  If you want something like this for your dog, get the clear pedialyte.  Most stores carry a generic version, which will be very cost effective).  It's cheaper, doesn't have that funky smell, and she actually seems like it better.  Plus I can put just a little in her bowl at a time, I don't have to give her a full 12 ounces.		This product just isn't economical.  Good in theory, poor in execution, and really poor in cost!
1,If I could give this one star, I would. We purchased the Repti Rain Mister in June 2017 to be used when we went on vacation and long weekends for our Chameleon. We've had this product less than 5 months and the entire thing died two weeks ago. Instead of spraying water, it starts leaking out of the bottom while the machine is on. It holds water otherwise. I can't figure it out, but I am not a happy camper, as when I purchase the item it was $70.00 and didn't even make it to the 6 month mark!
1,Cats won't go near it. I put 0.5ml in a 5.5 ounce can of wet food and neither cat ate anything. So weird.  I used welactin before and they were fine with it, guess ill go back to them.
1,I don't think Advantix is working any more.  We are struggling with fleas this year.  Nothing seems to help
1,It stinks, my dog immediately had a bad taste in her mouth, and when some splashed onto a vinyl tablecloth - it took the color right out. Ate through it. So no. Threw the rest away. Savings isn't worth torturing my dog.
1,I ordered this for a 35 gallon hexagon aquarium and it definitely fit. However it came in brown and I assumed that they would all be black as that is the color shown in the picture. I contacted the company and they basically said it's a crapshoot as to what you get. Wasnt at all pleased with the companies level of helpfulness but the lid fit so i kept it.
1,Charlie is my trick dog.  This was perfect size for dunking the basketball.  He is not impressed.  Refuses to take it in his mouth.  It has a very strong rubber smell.  Even washed in soap several times did not help.  So cant give it a good rating.  https://www.facebook.com/pages/Charlie-the-chihuahua-CGC-DSA-TT/411435205668991?ref=hl
1,Bought this, used it for 5 minutes, and returned it and ended up buying another one. just takes too long to do any sort of real grinding, and if you press too hard the grinder just slows down to a halt. And yes, we tried several out of box batteries. We are happier with the other grinder we bought.
1,I'm going to rate this honest according to my household experience with it. We wanted a new litterbox, something that worked better at absorbing. This wasn't too pricey so we decided to try it. We switched back to our hooded litterbox with fresh kitty liner pads. Pain to clean, pain to scoop, pain of everything, but works better than this system.		This system smelled awful. Its not hooded and doesn't have real litter so the poop is not covered. The poop sticks to these things weird and you'll end up throwing away tons of pellets (when it already doesn't feel like it comes with enough). Literally there aren't enough pellets to cover the bottom of the box, let alone the grate that is opened for urine to pass through. Now even if I scoop right away, there is that lingering scent for 10-20 minutes of the cat having pooped. Unpleasant when the litterbox is in your office.		That aside, there was the issue of the size of the pellets. These things are huge. My cats tried stepping on them and instead kept stepping to the sides where the box wasn't covered, or trying to dig through them to step on the box itself. Imagine taking your shoes off and walking through a garden of pebbles. Not gravel. Gravel is closer to litter. But literally walking through a ton of rocks and pebbles. Its not pleasant. The cats did not like it and I don't blame them. Somehow they managed to track these huge things. A few here and there. They might have been playing with them. Well -I- stepped on one and it felt like stepping on a lego. If it hurts my foot (which much doesn't bother me since I grew up barefoot in the country), then its not gonna feel pleasant on the kitty's paws.		We're not using it again. The cats were yowling through the house to be rid of it. Its on a shelf, never to be used again.
1,Cats love but prefer that they be inverted  (push both ends in with your fingers) to create a trumpet shape.  This is how I dealt with the frayed ends which might not be safe for cats who chew and love to take things apart.
1,TUFF?? Yeah right. They arrived an hour ago. I gave two of them to the dogs. Lil' guy (well, 70lbs) ripped it apart and removed all the stuffing from the smaller purple one. He ripped the part of the green one, ripped it apart and removed all the stuffing from it as well. All this in under an hour. I feel like renaming this product is in order..
1,Very easy to assemble but lightweight and flimsy.  Returned as this would not work for containing a dog more than 5 pounds.
