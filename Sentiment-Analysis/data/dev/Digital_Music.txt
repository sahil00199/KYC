0,A Vince Gill classic !!
0,Cool
0,Lots of good (not great) music for very little money.
0,good song.
0,Great!
0,This is as close to a true stereo version of this song as I can find. I'm still hoping that someone will find the original source multi-tracks and re-mix this into proper stereo. A great song like this needs to be properly produced.
0,Seen this song preformed on C.M.A and loved it.
0,The masters of smooth, lounge act-sounding songs are at it again.  Has a slightly different feel from most of their pop-ier hits, but a very good song, nonetheless.
0,I do like this song a lot! One of the songs I play a lot. Catchy! The other song I like a lot right now if you click see my other reviews you can see my review on that song (Warehouse Band, also hillsong relation). They are new on myspace, like em a lot.
0,All Shook Up.....Elvis Presley
0,love it
0,Funky music with lyrics you can understand.
0,A lot of songs I love to play! It's always good practice to listen to a variety of artists as a musician. I am a classical Double Bassist and I play a lot of classical Cello pieces either transcribed for Double Bass or I play them as they are. I love to hear different musicians performing the same song so I can hear what they've done with phrasing/ musicality, etc. and learn from that to always better my own performances. There is a lot of value for both Cellists and Bassists in this recording with 111 Cello performances....4 stars because I just wish they had one of these compilations for Double Bass!
0,Great song and this song will get you through ruff times and keep you up lifted
0,If you know the year the movie Grease debuted, you could probably make a good guess on my age.  Grease was all the rage and I heard the sound track through most of the summer. John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John were the on screen couple to watch that year.  If you like classics, this song is for you. :)
0,nice song will stick in your head all say
0,The more I hear this song, the better I like it. When new music is	Introduced in church on Sunday morning, I put it on my tablet when I get home.  I can listen to and learn the songs I am not familiar with.
0,I really like Chrisette and I like her music. Good CD, it speaks the truth as always. I am never disappointed with your music. Keep it up, you will always be a Soulful Sister! By the way, great job on the Anita Baker tribute on the 2010 Soul Train Awards. FREEDOM REIGN!!!!!
0,Can rate this exactly because it is my daughter's purchase, but if there were problems I would have heard about it.
0,This was my all time favorite back in the day.  It sure brings back the memories.
0,Great song. I remember it from some years ago when it was played all the time during a season of American Idol.
0,Yes. It met expectations.
0,This is the only place I found it ..... great Elvis Song
0,Classic rock song. Great in any music lover's collection.
0,My most favorite song in the world
0,A beautiful rock ballad that got way too much radio overplay. A DJ friend said he got so tired of the constant repeated call in requests from teen aged girls. Still its a good ballad that carries memories.
0,What can I say?  I am a child of the 80s.  Love this song, though my kids run screaming when it comes on!
0,great CD.
0,amazing worship
0,love it
0,Ac/dc is still an amazing live band!
0,This is one of my favorite songs it's so romantic
0,This is one of my most favorite songs from my younger days - time has flown by too quickly but this one helps recall those younger days!
0,If you are feeling a bit down this is a fun song I guess.  Surprisingly bouncy and upbeat for a song about requesting that the singer/musician play a song about being betrayed by a lover.		Obviously I liked it before purchasing or I wouldn't have gotten just the one song, so there isn't much more to say.
0,This song is amazing. I actually wish it was played on the radio.
0,Love this soundtrack! Can't wait for the next one to come out :-)
0,This set is mostly from the first 4 albums, but their rendition of Zep's "Good Times Bad Times" is unbelievably accurate from a baritone (Sully Erna) doing the lead vocal of a tenor (Robert Plant) without transposing the key.
0,Outstanding.
0,I've heard it said that when Trent Reznor, who wrote this song and performed it in solo and/or with Nine Inch Nails, he was very much opposed to Johnny Cash covering this song.  Yet, when Trent heard JC's version, he was truly impressed.  So am I.  This was recorded by Cash just after the death of his wife June Carter Cash, and shortly before he himself died.  I can hear the heartbreak in his voice.  He sounds old and weary, yet that works so well for him in this song.  This was truly his last iconic hit, in my opinion.  I love performing this song at karaoke, since I have a deep voice.  But it is incredibly challenging and difficult to achieve his style.  I've done it before, but it seems only by accident.  Cash is truly a master songwriter and performer, and this track is truly an exclamation mark on his entire repertoire.
0,I realised I had a gap in my MP3 collection. No Michael Jackson. I really liked Thriller when I was younger and apparently I still do. It works in my exercise MP3 collection and has to be called a pop classic. Go on, you know you want to relive the video.
0,Linkin Park was the best. Loved all their songs.
0,great song!
0,Catchy tune ...
0,Best friendship song I've ever heard. Pull on the heart strings if your without this kind of friend. Rest in	Peace Whitney Houston.
0,Great!
0,I love all of Peter,Paul and Mary's music and songs. They inspired me all the time as God inspired me to sing too!
0,Really love this song! Definitely worth the purchase!
0,My Wife and I enjoy setting in the family room in the evening and enjoying a cup of coffee while listening the our collection of songs.
0,Great for my luau party!
0,Good music :)
0,While most of the songs from Pitch Perfect are mash ups of others this is just Anna Kendrick singing with a cup.
0,This is a great party song, but definitely not for folks who don't at least like country a little bit.  Anyone who's ever had a solo cup party will be singing along to this tune in no time.  I am not a country lover, but I LOVE this song!  I purchased this version after seeing the Glee episode and was not disappointed.
0,Great song that brings back memories of a simpler time.  Frankie Valli's signature voice leading the way is a great trip back in time.  Glad "Jersey Boys" has reminded us of this GREAT classic music.
0,What I buy here are songs I've heard on K-LOVE and made a note of to buy later when I got the financial opportunity. They're all a five star pick, to me, or I wouldn't buy them.
0,Love IT......
0,OMG Tyrese has done it again - this is such a beautiful song.  And it is done very well
0,GREAT PRODUCT !!!
0,This has definitely been remastered, which is good!
0,Good. Pretty much what you would expect.
0,Loved it
0,Love the mp3 option, downloads automatically to your Amazon Cloud!
0,I love Michael. I owe a lot of his music and this one did not disappoint!
0,This is a group that I have purchased several albums of their music.  They do a great job on hymns.
0,Wonderfully quirky sounds from yesteryear, or maybe it was yesterday.
0,This song is from (or at least it was the main song) the movie "Caddyshack"; to me it is Loggins best dancing song by far; it has a very good bit of rhythm, and it moves right along (put on your dancing shoes for this one).  If you haven't seen the movie, you get two bonuses:  one you get to listen to this song and get a feeling for it, and two, you get some pretty good comedy with Steve Martin and some other skilled comedian type good actors.  (And you get to see the gopher outwit them.)  I guess this is a plug for the movie as well as the song.  Usually I think of Loggins as a dual (Loggins and Messina), but this shows he has some pretty good talent all by himself.  Enjoy!
0,Great song by a talented group. It's sad that a lot of songs aren't recognized until they are used for commercials on TV.
0,A powerful praise and worship song
0,my kinda music.
0,What a song, this is sweet, salty, savory, and a bit smoky. As we call it sometimes "all dressed".
0,Toby Keith Just Keeps Producing Hit After Hit, And This Song Is A Definite Hit And A Must To Add To Your Country Music Collection
0,All i have to say is "DUUUUDE"
0,To me this is among Aerosmith's greatest songs. Yet it is left off of most compilations. I had two other compilations so I bought just this track to fill in a gap. BUT if you don't have an Aerosmith compilation, "The Essential Aerosmith" is the one to have! After all, "[You] Don't Want to Miss a Thing".
0,If you were around for the 60s you will remember this song. This is so mellow and groovey. Enjoy and peace.
0,he sings  those notes like he is playing a killer lead guitar
0,Great!
0,It sounds great
0,I am really impressed by how good the music is.  I really like Jussie Smollett's voice.  He's got a great falsetto.  I usually just purchase one song for my mp3.  But I enjoyed so many of the songs from this soundtrack that I just purchased the whole thing.  Totally worth it.
0,So smikey good
0,This is a contemporary song with an older folk-rock vibe.  It is reminiscent of Bob Seeger's work in my opinion.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.  It is a fun and lively song.
0,The Crystals were Phil Spector's most successful girl group and the mainstay of the Philles label through the early sixties. Like most of the girl groups before Motown, they were from New York and were one of the groups that defined the New York Sound. I remember being really surprised when i learned that Phil Spector lived and recorded in L.A.' But it's such a New York sound', I thought. The Crystals and Ronettes were from New York, and even more than that, the songs were composed by the great Brill Building composers like Goffin & King, Weil & Mann and Barry & Greenwich, and the Brill Building was just north of Times Square. Spector himself learned production not only from Stan Ross at L.A.'s Gold Star (where he would record most of his songs) but also went to apprentice with Lieber & Stoller in the Brill Building. This is why an early hit like Uptown has a sound similar to The Drifters.		The group formed in 1961 with the help of their uncle, Benny Wells, who had played in big bands; they were named for his daughter, Crystal. Phil Spector and Lester Sill had just formed Philles Records (Phil & Les) and, looking for talent, signed The Crystals right away. In early '62 There's No Other Like My Baby became the label's first Top 20 hit and already showed the amplification of the girls' voices with echo and reverb. Such sudden success meant television appearances and tours in Cavalcade of Stars type formats with lots of groups and performers from all Top 40 styles.		The big hit came in the Fall of '62 with He's a Rebel, and it's such a strange story I just have to tell it, though I'll try to keep it short. The song was written by singer Gene Pitney, who was also breaking out with hits like Town Without Pity and (The Man Who Shot) Liberty Valence. It was first offered to The Shirelles, but they turned it down because they didn't like the idea of the boy being bad. Spector meanwhile had recently taken the job of head of A&R at the Liberty label, a major independent. They had it slated to be Vikki Carr's next single, but when Spector heard it he knew it had hit potential and decided to beat Liberty and record it himself. Now Phil Spector may have been a brilliant producer who supervised every aspect of his operation, but he wasn't a particularly nice person. Like Alfred Hitchcock who famously called his actors "cattle", I believe Spector thought the songs were all about him, and the singers were really just another element in the mix. And with a full Phil Spector production with its many backup vocalists, band members and engineering tricks, in a sense he was right. The Crystals were on tour and couldn't get to L.A. as fast as Spector needed to beat Liberty to the punch. So he had Darlene Love & the Blossoms record it but then put it out as The Crystals, probably because they were his big hit group and that would guarantee airplay. The actual Crystals had to promote it as their own and Darlene Love couldn't say anything. He's a Rebel hit #1 in the country on November 3, 1962 keeping Gene Pitney's Only Love Can Break a Heart from the #1 position.		That was not a one time thing for Spector. He used Darlene Love & the Blossoms on several other crystals releases, sometimes with Crystals' lead Dolores" La La" Brooks. four early Darlene Love & the Blossoms songs were put on The Crystals' Greatest Hits album. The Crystals weren't done with hits yet. They continued their streak with the upbeat He's Sure the Boy I Love in late '62  and in '63, the big year of the Girl Groups they had two classics, Da Doo Ron Ron and Then He Kissed Me. These were full, all-out Spector Wall-of-Sound productions that seem to have been recorded in the Bayreuth Festival Hall with a cast of hundreds. They sounded great, delivering a feeling of excitement unheard of on a 45RPM record. Spector may have been inconsiderate of his performers but he gave his all to the recordings.		Then He Kissed Me was the last hit for The Crystals. They later claimed that once he signed Ronnie & the Ronettes, he neglected them. That very well could be true, but their two low-charting 1964 songs, Little Boy and All Grown Up are on this collection and they are good songs given the full production. 1964 was the year of The British Invasion,and that was what was probably having the biggest effect on The Crystals' career.		This is an excellent retrospective and I can't imagine a better one coming out in the near future. It is from EMI, now part of Universal, and has been beautifully remastered and is better than the 1992 ABKCO disc with the pink cover.
0,The song Mercury Blues has been around for decades but I think this Alan Jackson version of it is without doubt the best.  I highly recommend it if you are a fan of Alan Jackson or just like this song. Very happy. Would buy it again. As always I would urge those considering purchase to listen to the sample clip first.
0,I love it!!

0,I'd have to say that The Cult have come up with one of their better albums in years!  This is the sound that brought me to loving The Cult in the first place!  All of the twelve songs are original and mostly hard rockers...which is what keeps my hopes alive that rock is not dead!  Give it a spin and enjoy!  I sure did!  I'll listen to this one many times!
0,A classic by an American iconic duo.  Haven't heard it in years and it sounded as good as it did in my youth.  They don't write them like that anymore.
0,From the moment I heard it I could not stop playing it.  A must have  wonderful song well worth the buy!!!
0,Blake Shelton has a great singing voice and this song just hits me where it counts--my heart.  Love and regrets.  Great singing.
0,you will not be disappointed in this album no mater what kind of music you like--he is such a natural
0,Justine is a truly talented singer. She really sings from her heart and soul. Even though Justine has backup singers, she has the voice to sing this solo with no backup needed. And because of this, I really love this song. When I select a new song for my Gospel Song selection, I am rather picky as I want singers who sing from their heart!		If you love Gospel songs and worship and praises type of music, then I highly recommend this song to you!
0,Brings back a lot on good memories and I really Do Enjoy it I also recommend this to anyone who enjoys music.

0,I heard this on the radio, and fell in love with the guitar riffs and the almost ethereal vocals. Not the usual Fleetwood Mac.
0,Good, strong Irish rock. Perfect for getting you moving.		This song has a lot of energy to it and is what I use to get myself going when I have a day of work in front of me that I don't feel up to doing. It makes you want to get up, move, and conquer the world.		Good song. Should be on everyone's playlist.

0,I am a big fan of Leonard Cohen, but I don't care for his earlier albums.  Not being a fan of any folk music, regardless of lyrics, I have always preferred other ways for singer/songwriters to compose.  Of course, that's my personal preference, and in no way do I want to denigrate this great man's earlier works either - it just isn't my cup of tea, and I'm not a fan of most live music either unless it does something different and exciting.	  "Ten New Songs" is past Cohen's pure folk style where he started employing different elements, like synthesizers on "I'm Your Man" or bluesy like "Popular People".  The main difference for me is his voice.  As he grew older, his vocal performance took on an almost mystical quality - so deep, some half spoken, especially on "Dear Heather" or his last few albums, including the beautiful and my favorite album of his, "You Want It Darker", one of the saddest yet brilliant and catchy albums ever.	  "Ten New Songs" came after a nine year break, and according to amazon's review, he spent most of it in a monastery studying Zen teachings.  I'm not sure just how effective that isolation may have been but this album is the most languid and smooth of his latter works, and that's saying something coming from a man like him who defined mellow and cool in his music.  Sharon Robinson was a big part of this album, and played the lion's share of instruments and provided her own backing vocals.  She also wrote a lot of the music, with Cohen of course providing his usual genius lyrics and smoky voice.	  This album like no other Cohen CD is truly a captivating one as the style stays consistent with some of the most pensive and ethereal material he's done.  For those who are most attracted by his lyrics, they are included, but "Ten New Songs" are truly a set of tunes that fit together like a puzzle, with no pieces to be spared.  It isn't quirky, like "Popular Problems", a bit weird (but still great) like "Dear Heather", or synth heavy like "I'm Your Man".  It's another essential album from a genius who is and will continue to be a sorely missed presence in a music scene that desperately is crying out for the kind of quality he possessed.

0,Hard to believe that it has been over 30 years since Sting had started his successful solo career, after he had said goodbye to The Police. Honestly, the songs that Sting has done on his own all this time, absolutely stand taller than just the days of Punk he had with Stewart and Andy. Sting has made some really remarkable songs, and they are definitely much better than the jokes that are on radio today, who do not even have a sliver of the soul that Sting has had for years in music. One of my favorite songs Sting came out with back in the 90's, Desert Rose is one of those melodic and spiritual songs that still is very upbeat and hypnotic to the soul that still sounds just as driven today, as you would expect from Sting himself. I have loved this song for years, and it still strikes at the heart of the matter as one of his best songs ever. It is just too sad that the stars of today, well the overexposed jokes of Beyonce' Knowles and Rihanna, cannot even have a single song that can drive from the bloom of the flower like Sting has. If you have never even heard a Sting song before, well this is one of my Top 5 picks from his illustrious works of art that I suggest that you do go to.		Song: B+

0,This goes back to 1967. The song immediately appealed to me. I always liked Judy's eclectic and straight forward style. She really knows how to present her material. This song proved to be a major hit for her. I still love it. The MP3 sound is acceptable.

0,Mumford & Sons' 3rd set shifts with more electric arrangement, still marked by strong songwriting, musicianship and powerful vocals.  The opening track "Tompkins Square Park" bounces with producer James Ford sitting in on drums on a farewell song, "I want to hold you in the dark once last time."  "Believe" starts with a dreamy keyboard wash and a catchy melody, "I had the strangest feeling, your world's not all it seems; So tired of misconceiving what else this could've been."  "Just Smoke" is the track currently coiling into my personal top ten with its driving beat, literate lyric and lovely melody, "Take a minute, take a breath, lay down your head on my sunken chest; I saw a flicker and just smoke, but as you left I was calling your name at the night."  "Ditmas" is another strong track with a heartbreak lyric and guitars that thunder on the chorus, "This is all I ever was; and this is all you came across those years ago; Now you've gone too far; Don't tell me that I've changed because that's not the truth, and now I'm losing you."  "Wilder Mind" is a very strong CD, different from the band's previous discs, but showing growth while maintaining great quality.  Enjoy!
0,Who would not like Starman. In my opinion this was one of David Bowie's really good songs. The man was a genius and even if I did not like everything he produced many of the songs have become iconic and I really believe that Starman is one of them.

0,Man, this album was a big surprise. Australian Metalcore band Parkway Drive had been releasing consistent, easily identifiable records with a definite style that they wouldnt deviate from too much, they had a style that they worked within and had absolutely perfected.	With their fifth full-length studio album, Ire, Parkway take their rulebook and throw it too the wind. This is the biggest stylistic shake-up in the bands history by a country mile. This album is fresh, exciting, radically different than whats came before. Its such a big difference that you can almost expect the cries of sell out! to slither out of your speakers themselves. The thing is, this doesnt feel like a sell-out, its just an invigoration, a refreshening, and a new twist on things.		There are some seriously different atmospheres and a very different vibe to it than you may have been used to before. The songs are brighter, catchier, more sing-along focused, there are more concert-baiting backing vocals, theres more stomps and clap noises and theres way more melody. It is a strange mixture of the band going in a Traditional Heavy Metal or Power Metal route with much more bright major-key dual guitar melodies, as well as going in a groove or almost Nu Metal direction, with almost rapped vocals and some seriously rhythmic music. Its like constantly flipping between Machine Heads The Burning Red and then The Blackening, with Parkway Drives masterpiece Deep Blue being interjected every so often. Imagine Parkway Drive covering Five Finger Death Punch and Iron Maiden in a medley  thats a vague ballpark of the sort of directions this experimental album almost evokes, if not actually sounds directly like.		In terms of musicianship Parkway have always been excellent but the virtuosity on show here is next-level. Vocally, this is the most melodic and expressive Winston McCall has ever been. Lyrically, this album is continuing on from their previous album Atlas, but sounding even more vital, important and interesting without ever feeling preachy or finger-wagging.		Its almost difficult to call out stand-out moments, because every song is different than the last, theres so much going on, so many songs that would be the best song on their peers album, so many moments that rip a huge smile across my face, that the album as a whole is just astounding.		At the time of writing, my favourite songs might just be the absolutely anthemic feel-good tune Vice Grip which sounds like the final scene in a sports movie, the massive groovey rhythmic scream-along Crushed which feels like it was written in 1999, and Vicious which has the best guitar of Parkways career to date  and when Winston starts going on about burning it all to ash, you feel where hes coming from.		If you thought Parkway Drive were just going to rehash old ideas, you thought wrong, variety is the key theme here. Interestingly though, theyve managed this without compromising themselves, it still sounds unmistakably like Parkway Drive. It is little touches theyve done before stretched out to whole songs, or traditionally Parkway sounding bits but with bongos underneath, or just focussing on one element of their sound more than others.		Overall; If you are deathly afraid of melody, catchiness, or hand-clapsand you don't want anything on your music to sound any fun then by all means avoid this album but for everyone else, Parkway have released a game changing, barn-storming, absolute rager here, and if you like this sort of music at all you seriously need to check it out.
0,And, I love being able to purchase all these songs. It reminds me of the old days when we paid 30-cents for a single-45 record. You only bought the songs you liked, *vbs*.
0,While the ladies are no longer together, I will forever be grateful, as we all will be, for Natalie Stewart, a.k.a. The Floacist, and Marsha Ambrosius, a.k.a. The Songstress, for putting this in the more than capable hands of Michael Jackson. "Butterflies." He put it down on this one and forever and always, we will have the instrument to express ourselves to the special someone when we feel, ~Butterflies~ If you cannot get your nerves together, just press play & allow Mike to help you along. It is always a good thing when the teacher can show the student the right way to get it done. Just be willing to ask. ~K.I.S.S~

0,I recently discovered Virtual Box Set  Complete Beethoven Piano Sonatas while browsing through the digital music section at Amazon.com. When I saw this MP3 albums amazingly low price of $6.99 for the entire collection of 32 Beethoven piano sonatas, I immediately purchased it. I am very glad I did.		Jen Jand&oacute; is a Hungarian concert pianist who has recorded for the Naxos classical music label for over twenty years. He is the featured soloist on Virtual Box Set  Complete Beethoven Piano Sonatas, and his performances of these masterworks are uniformly excellent. Jand&oacute; plays in a highly polished, artistic, and yet straightforward manner that conveys Beethovens full range of emotions very effectively, but without any unnecessary musical flourishes. He is very easy and enjoyable to listen to. I don't think he is in quite the same exalted company as elite concert pianists like Murray Perahia, Vladimir Ashkenazy, or Martha Argerich, (to name but a few), but Jand&oacute; acquits himself very well indeed in each note of every Beethoven piano sonata he plays.		I think Virtual Box Set  Complete Beethoven Piano Sonatas by Jen Jand&oacute; is an excellent way to acquire a complete cycle of Beethoven's piano sonatas at a very affordable price. While perhaps not the very top choice for these works, it is certainly a clear winner, and one of my new favorites. Highly recommended. (4 Stars ^ 5)
0,Cyndi Lauper has been another one of the most successful female solo artists of the early 80s. Her career started to take a fall with the release of 1989 album, A Night To Remember. After the unwanted failure of A Night To Remember (1989). In 1993, Cyndi released another album that failed entitled, Hat Full Of Stars.	  In 2003, she was able to release, The Essential Cyndi Lauper, her second greatest hits compilation since Twelve Deadly Cyns ...And Then Some (1994). I definitely call it a must-have album.	GIRLS JUST WANT TO HAVE FUN	  From the album She's So Unusual (1983). I have loved this song since my years in middle school. I love it's fun-filled energy and I love it's crazed vibe. It's a classic all the way.	MONEY CHANGES EVERYTHING	  From the album She's So Unusual (1983). Another great song, but in my opinion, not among the best. I hope you know that it's true that money, in most ways, most certainly does change everything.	WHO LET IN THE RAIN	  From the album Hat Full Of Stars (1993). The album Hat Full Of Stars (1993), as for I know, only had three songs I ever liked and they are That's What I Think, Hat Full Of Stars, and Who Let The Rain In. This is a moving ballad and I recommend that you all listen to it.	SHE BOP	  From the album She's So Unusual (1983). I still can't get over the fact that this one talks about female masturbation. Nobody wagged their fingers at Cyndi for making a song like this, but if Madonna recorded this song, the critics and parents would have been down her throat. This is a great song. I remember watching Cyndi's Behind The Music on VH1. When they were talking about this track and all the controversey, Cyndi said that her mother called her up and said, "Is this song about... that?" I was laughing for days.	TIME AFTER TIME	  From the album She's So Unusual (1983). I have always enjoyed this song because of its moving arrangements and vocal arrangements. Everytime I see Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow dance with Alan Cumming to this song in 'Romy & Michelle's High School Reunion', I cry after laughing so hard, even though they did a great job with the choreography. I know shouldn't be laughing because they danced so great, but it's just that they chose a romantic ballad that requires slow-dancing and they decided to use ballet as their dance.	I DROVE ALL NIGHT	  From the album A Night To Remember (1989). This is one of the best songs I have heard from Cyndi Lauper and it came from the best album Cyndi Lauper has ever recorded, A Night To Remember. The album did not get the recognition it deserved, it is her best album by far.	HAT FULL OF STARS	  From the album Hat Full Of Stars (1993). Another great song from the Hat Full Of Stars album. I knew from the moment I read the title that it would be a great song and I was right. I love it when I'm right.	CHANGE OF HEART	  From the album True Colors (1986). This is one of the three songs from the True Colors (1986) album that I like. The True Colors (1986) album is not a favorite album of mine, all though I love the front and back covers of that album. This song has a great vibe to it and the lyrics are well-written. Cyndi's voice was amazing on this one to begin with, but The Bangles', who provided back-ups, vocals thicken Cyndi's voice, making her voice sound like it has more enthusiasm.	SISTERS OF AVALON	  From the album Sisters Of Avalon (1997). This is a good song, but it's not like her original sound. If she decided to change her sound, she shouldn't have made it sound like this. I know she has the talent to better than this.	ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT	  From the album She's So Unusual (1983). This is another song with a moving sound. The vocals are incredible, the music is incredible. Who would not love this song, except for people with no brains?	WHEN YOU WERE MINE	  From the album She's So Unusual (1983). Although, this is a great song, I don't like the fact that it was originally done by Prince. I literally hate Prince with a passion. In my opinion, he's a great lyricist, but he and his music can go straight to hell because I can't stand him or his music.	TRUE COLORS	  From the album True Colors (1986). The second of three songs I like from the True Colors (1986) album. The guitar arrangements are incredible.	UNHOOK THE STARS	  From the album Sisters Of Avalon (1997). She did reinvent her sound for the Sisters Of Avalon (1997) album and not well at all. This is a song I always skip. I can't waste my time listening to a song that sounds like crap.	THE GOONIES 'R' GOOD ENOUGH	  From the original motion picture & soundtrack The Goonies (1985). The Goonies has always been one of my favorite movies. The movie was filmed and released in 1985, the year that I was born. It's hard for me to believe that this movie is as old as I am and I still get a kick out of it. This song is amazing and Cyndi was the right choice to record it. The movie, original motion picture score, and this song all remind me of Wildwood, New Jersey. I don't know why, it just happened. This is one of the best songs from Cyndi Lauper and I'm happy to know that it was included in this incredible collection.	  If you are a Cyndi Lauper fan, then you need to buy a copy of this collection. It's worth all the money you pay and you are guaranteed to be impressed.
0,One of my favorite by Clint.
0,George just gets better with age this song is equal to Troubadour.  it just want to make you lay back and kick your feet up.

0,Great song, to the point, speaks to me.  Ive heard it a lot of times on the radio and so I grabbed it for my collection.  It gets played a lot.
0,One of my all time jams!!
0,I love the message and the music in this song. The message conveys my soul's longing and the music appeals to my ears and music ability.
1,The actor Terence Howard has ventured into the music form, with this, his debut album. According to the man himself, music is his first love, and if it came to having to choose between acting & music, music would always win out. So, what does he offer us, as a way to see if he is as talented a musician, as he is a actor.	Well, firstly there's his voice. On many reviews I have read around the web, he has been castigated for his singing voice, which I think is a little harsh. Bob Dylan and Lou Reed are two artists that, to my ears, haven't got the greatest voices in the world, but that doesn't stop them from having success and award selling albums. To these ears his voice suits the music on offer.	And to me that is the problem, the music on offer. Whilst not awful, there's not much here that stands out. Whilst it's pleasant sounding, it all kind of blends into a much ness. The exception to this rule and my favourite track on offer here is 'Spanish Love Guitar' in which Terence show cases his skills on said guitar. This is a lovely moment that I kept on repeat for a while, enjoying the soothing sound.		I do hope that this isn't Mr. Howard one & only shot at a musical and that Sony back him with the means to produce a sophomore album. This CD hints at more to come.
1,Not a huge fan of the song itself,  but if you're a DJ or play live you must have this song due to the nature of the whole Mannequin thing.
1,I bought this for my husband. I don't listen to him.
1,Ok this is the last Emmylou Harris CD I will ever buy!  5 clunkers in a row.  You can fool me once (with Mirror Ball), and you can fool me twice (with Red Dirt Girl), and you can fool me 3 times (with Stumble Into Grace), and you can fool me 4 times (with All I Intended To Be) and now you have fooled me FIVE times (with Hard Bargain) but I have finally caught on - Emmylou is will NEVER make another good album and I will NOT be fooled for a 6th time!  She continues with the very muddy production sound here which would be ok with great songs, but here once again the songs are just B-O-R-I-N-G and repetitive. They all sond the exactly same! zzzzzzzzzzzz Avoid.
1,somewhere between being a broke  Jennifer lopez meets a Broke Beyonce and a couple of other	acts in places. eye candy factor she is on point,as a music  artist she is almost below zero.	her voice is pretty liteweight. a couple  of ok  tracks,  however  she  is a  great artist to listen to	on mute  if  she had a calendar.
1,This is NOT a piece of music.		It is only used for tuning up an orchestra or instrument.		Unless you want to tune your musical instrument, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.		All this is is a single tone, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.
1,Gift
1,I'm sure everyone was curious to hear this album with "Ordinary World."  This song debuted in the late 90's.  Beforehand, all their stuff was from the 80's.  "...ours is just a little trouble at all..." I'm sure is a fav lyric by most of their fans.	It's not your traditional slow song.  You will also like "Come Undone."  I also have the trance version of "Ordinary  World."
1,First, Gangnam Style, then Thrift Shop, then Harlem Shake, and now this pile of crap. Seriously, this song sounds like a preschool-level picture-book with an audio CD for toddlers to play duck duck goose to. The lyrics will prove you that. Now that we know society has gotten worse than it already has been by this song: a nursery rhyme for babies and toddlers that is actually peaking high on the hot 100. This is ACTUALLY doing "successful"? I think this song should have gone in a filthy toilet with everything else in music I hate to the core.
1,Wasnt what I wanted
1,I downloaded this free song. I deleted it because it's not my music style. It was rap and the words were fine but I don't like rap.
1,I bought this to help me relax.  The ocean is to violent. He must have recorded the sound at high tide when there was a storm approaching.
1,Never like her first single and never like this song at all !	Quit hogging all the airplay and let the other artists shine for once.	Please stop making music. Purchase my albums instead , you'll thank me later.
1,dont listen to music because music bores me and i don't even listen to music at all to begin with
1,wack song but hey it's almost 15 years later puff's bigger than ever he made a big name with music, clothes, tv shows, reality shows, and faith evans remarried and is now a hasbeen drug addict. stil puff benefited.
1,Not a Chesney fan, but decent song
1,also starts getting eh...
1,not as good as a song as i thought it would be so im sorry but is was not worth purchasin
1,No complaints about the content, the music is great. The only issue, and a BIG issue, is how MAKES everyone go through the Amazon Music player just to download the music THAT SHOULD OF BEEN DOWNLOADED TO YOUR COMPUTER IN THE FISRT PLACECAUSE AFTER ALL THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE PAYING FOR!!!	IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE why in the world they feel the need to make you jump through all kinds of hoops simply to get WHAT YOU BOUGHT!!! *People simply want to download it to their computer no strings attached!!* ***This is the most useless hassle I have ever come across in dealing with WHAT SHOULD BE A REALLY SIMPLE and straight forward task such as downloading the music you just bought***	I have NEVER met anyone that goes out of their wallet to buy music and prefers it to keep it on a stream player app on their computer-_-  If it was like that they would just keep listening to it on youtube.	Its like the most ANNOYING, USELESS "middle man" there could possibly be. If anyone is PAYING for ANYTHING digital it should be a really BASIC-COMMON SENSE LOGIC that they want it on their computer.and not have it rely on a stupid music stream application where they have to change a bunch of settings JUST TO GET WHAT THEY PAID FOR IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!  The MOST idiotic thing is that they don't even give you a choice to download it straight to your computer after you buy itit HAS to go through this useless process.  The thing doesn't even allow you to select to open the folder the music is stored in!  AND on top of that you have to deal with TONS of annoying bugs and glitches, some of which makes you completely stuck, even after re-opening the app, and often makes you have to just completely re-install the it.	***It should be a given that if you purchase a song and select it to download that you *DO_NOT* want it to go directly to some pain in the butt software that for 1, is ALWAYS has some type of super annoying bug and 2, is purely a unnecessary and just a straight up hassle.***  For the pathetic amazon music player I give it 1 star, if I could I would give it a -5 score rating.  I couldn't find anywhere where I can review the music player so Im leaving it here.
1,A freebie from our friends at Amazon.  I always enjoy a good freebie, it is a great way to try things.
1,I used to drive a school bus and would download music that the kids liked. This is unfortunately one of their favorites. Now that those days are over, I'm deleting it!
1,So this isn't a terrible record but let's be honest: it's not very good. I don't hear a lot of Matt Skiba in these songs but that's okay. Mark and Travis are good songwriters on their own (I really enjoyed their +44 album). But you know who I do hear a lot of here? John Feldman. And that's a problem.	How has John Feldman become an in demand producer/ songwriter? His band Goldfinger were notorious trend hoppers without the good taste of writing memorable songs. As a producer he scrubs all the dirt from any song and then fills every empty space with generic, bland "whoa-oh' vocals, assuming that's melody or memorable songwriting.	There are a few decent songs here and there but not enough to recommend this album.
1,It doesn't play all the songs.  I only get 1 song.  It's the worst music recording that I've bought.  If I could I would send it back.
1,ok
1,another dime a dozen singers.  nothing to brag about with his music.
1,never got the dc theybsay it was delivered but i did not get it so i mad it was a gift for my daugher shr want for here  birthday  so im don't know if im going to buy frome then
1,This is NOT a piece of music.		It is only used for tuning up an orchestra or instrument.		Unless you want to tune your musical instrument, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.		All this is is a single tone, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.
1,I know I shouldn't complain,  after all it was free.  I guess I was just expecting a little bit more,  how can I put it music,
1,What were they smoking when they wrote this? Probably the same thing I was smoking when I bought it.!	This song should have been put out before it started. The only thing I liked about it was... nothing.
1,The arrogance of young people, especially really young people always amazes me!  The tune is catchy but the lyrics are just a bunch of young guys mentally masturbating!  Buy REO Speedwagon for some good music that has lyrics that actually mean something.
1,Did not order, don't know why it is showing up on my account.
1,meh
1,Aaron Lewis is a phony! Plain and simple! He tries to fool all of us country music fans with his false redneck image,when the truth is,this guy is not even from the south. Wasn't even born down there. Lewis wouldn't know what REAL country music was if it bit him in the a**. If you wanna listen to a REAL Country music CD,then get one of Hank III's albums. Hank III tells the truth and exposes country-wanna be's like Lewis and Kid Rock in his music.
1,WOW. Adam Levine needs to seriously take some singing lessons. He just cant sing. And why does EVERY song they make sound EXACTLY THE SAME??	they need to put more thought into the words and try and sound like a dude
1,Poor quality
1,The song is catchy, they all have great voices, but they repeat the chorus too much. It feels like a 10 minute song because they just drag on the same stuff.
1,I thought it was ok at first but not only not okay but removing from my computer.
1,I didn't order this
1,Embedded DRM prevents burning Amazon.com downloaded MP3 to a CD. Digital player only.  I do not recommend these downloads for this reason.
1,After a few attempts, I have yet to finish listening to this song. I forced myself to listen to 1/2 of it, but I don't find it relaxing, inspiring, energizing or engaging.
1,didn't like
1,Downloaded  by mistake. I really don't  care for it.  I meant Girl on Fire. I need to pay more attention
1,Someone that loves nothing but piano music might think about this, but to me it was too much of the same thing. I got bored with it quickly.
1,Too  much gayest in this Cd for me
1,song is OK, not really my style i guess.  I didn't enjoy it but if this type of music is your thing, than go ahead.
1,No you didn't bring sexy back. Just desperate to keep your music career going.	The song is overrated & way overplayed. You can stop making music and movies all together.	Please stop your terrible !
1,I never got it in my music library. It is not there. I PAID for the item and it never was recvd in my music library on my kindle...... how about putting it there or refund my money. this also happened with the other song I purchased called Cut the Cake by Average White band. Receipt shows up on line, but no product in my kindle. Therefore I am missing two songs I purchased. Not sure why I am being congratulated for this...
1,Wow, talk about zero originality! What do you do when you can't come up with anything original to save your life? Ripoff an old surf instrumental~ what else!
1,Should have only downloaded the song one time.  Don't like it that you couldn't sample the music first.
1,ILLUMINATI PUPPET!!!
1,I'm not going to lie to you: I didn't like Taylor Swift's 1989. I thought it was boring. I thought it was plain. I thought it was bland. So I might not be the right person to listen to about this record.	I like Ryan Adams okay. He's written some really great songs. He's put out some really strong albums. I don't like everything he does (included but limited to his recent production work on Butch Walker's AFRAID OF GHOSTS) but I would say I enjoy more of his stuff than not.	So when I heard that he was doing a track-by-track cover of Taylor Swift's immensely overrated 1989 I was a little intrigued. Especially when he was said to be doing so in the style of the Smiths. So when it hit Spotify I thought I would give it a chance to see if it was worth the purchase.	I am glad I did so. Because these songs are still just not very good. Adams does a couple of interesting things here. But I still find the narrator of these songs incredibly out of date and incredibly out of step with the real world. The melodies never really take hold and it's kind of boring to listen to. Maybe as background music this works but it didn't command my attention.	But a lot of people seem to like this version also. So I am just missing something. Because even in this context I find these songs on the weaker side of mediocre.
1,Whether it's by kicking a female fan at one of his concerts or admitting he's sleeping with his cousin, Baton Rouge rapper and Atlantic Records artist Kevin Gates (Kevin Gilyard) sure knows how to make himself look like a douchebag in the public eye. And for those two revelations to surface close to the release of Islah, his debut studio album, means an even more severe blow has been dealt to his likability and career-longevity. Gates has released several mixtapes since 2006, worked with many notables in the game and was inducted into XXL's 2014 Freshmen Class, something the popular hip-hop magazine might be regretting now. Islah (released Jan. 29) is just what you'd expect from Gates and nothing more, as he positions himself comfortably in the dual role of gangster and lover in this precisely unimpressive first major label LP of his.		Islah actually starts off decently, but it doesn't last long. Gates holds hip-hop's pupils' attention for the entirety of the first song, "Not The Only One," with its ordinary but nice low-key beat and the good kindhearted intentions of its contents, and Gates also has some solid flows in there, but after track's end, the ADD is likely to flare up for wildly anxious listeners. All of the rest of the album proceeds in the exact same predictable way, showcasing Gates as either a hard product of the trap or an experienced romantic, and he takes really no chances anywhere.		"Really Really" and "Two Phones" attempt to establish authenticity and rally up support for Gates's cause and brand, and "Pride" shows his softer side as he misses his ex-girlfriend and carries on in that way. He then goes back and forth between the streets and his relationships, song for song between the hood and his love life, the ghetto and the game of love. This two-way structure is pretty obvious to make note of if you map out the whole tracklist. Gates switches from one to the other so regularly that the pattern is really conspicuous, and the issue isn't necessarily in the skeleton or outline or the number of topics presented but rather in the nature of the topics. The sensationalization of the dangerous black "gutter" and emotionalized intersex relations are such trite rituals for rap in these times. Accurate reporting from real black communities is always useful, but here it's wickedly and exaggeratedly characterized and dramatized so that it's no longer in a useful context.		Bars-wise, Gates is up to snuff based on his prior standards, but lyrically he hasn't challenged himself. His scratchy low voice and occasionally funny side remarks and hooks are unmistakeable, but it's all in the service of his and his label's agenda and image-advancement. The music doesn't make a great impression or step forward either, and for all the different producers involved in making Islah, the beats all sound too similar, too consistent from one to the next, all using the current trap style or some pop variation, like in "Kno One," a universally appealable slow jam engineered for the people. And besides Trey Songz, Jamie Foxx and Ty Dolla $ign in the bonus "Jam," the non-deluxe version is completely guest-less. For a debut, Islah is disappointing, and considering who and where it's coming from, people shouldn't be surprised. Kevin Gates cares more about getting major "paper" in the game than being a major player in the game.
1,I got this song because it was free and I am not a fan of it.  Not worth spending money on.
1,I bought this song to add to a road trip playlist. I personally hate country music, but my buddy is a huge fan so I added it for him
1,ok
1,I've seen LLB 4 timed and really like them.  This EP is nowhere as good as their original material.  I recommend you pass on this one!
1,I remember first hearing this song on American Idol by the contestant that sang it and I heard wrote it, Bo Bice.  I remember first hearing it on the radio, it just debuted or something.  I guess it was too new for me to get the singers name, because later on that week, Bo Bice sang it, and I thought oh, he's singing that new song on the radio.  Then American Idol said Bo Bice wrote the song.  Now Gavin Degraw sings it, but that is way after hearing it on Season 4 of American Idol, with Bo Bice, Constatine, and Carrie Underwood, who won American Idol season 4.	Ok, Bo Bice sang the song, which had a much harder edge.  Gavin Degraw actually did pretty well with it!
1,OK
1,This might be a good song for some people but it wasn't what I thought it was.  I didn't like the beat, or the way it was sung.  I'm into gospel.  It's not a bad song, just not for me.
1,For some reason, all of Jewel's albums after her first one have fallen to mixed reviews. I actually liked her first three albums, but I wish I could say the same for her latest album, 0304.	I have no idea what's going on with this album. It seems like while making this Jewel spent a lot of time partying, because a lot of these songs sound like they were made strictly for the club. Such tracks include "Run 2 U" and especially the leadoff single, the R&B-ish "Intuition". The music on these songs isn't bad, but it just doesn't sound like Jewel. If she's trying to change her style but just easing into it instead of changing all at once, it would sound better if a few more songs on here followed that example.	And when I listened to the rest of tracks on here, I noticed they don't flow all that well because they sound EXTREMELY too different from each other, thus making you almost wonder if you're listening to a compilation rather than an authentic album. "Becoming" will have you pondering who will fall asleep first: you or Jewel, and I don't know what possessed her to come up with "Haunted". "2 Find U" is okay, but I liked it better the first time I heard it, when it was called "Standing Still" (or the second time, when it was called "This Way").	Another problem here is the lyrics. Songs like "Fragile Heart" and especially "U & Me = Love" could have been rewritten a few times. I don't know how a party joint got on this album, but "Yes U Can" deserves some serious fast-forward button pushing. And can anyone make any sense out of "Stand"?	I don't know what Jewel was trying to do here, because the album is 54 minutes of confusion. Even the album title is confusing, considering it came out on 0603. Maybe that's not what it means, but regardless, Jewel dropped a major brick with this album. Hopefully she'll realize this was a mistake and come back to Earth for her next album.
1,Sucky song
1,Could not get this to download.  Kept getting error saying download failed.  This is a waste of money.  Don't buy if you want to download to your computer.

1,I don't particularly like this version of the song, but I had a need for "Joy to the World", and this one just so happened to be free. I'll be looking for something more substantial next Christmas season.
1,I love the Arcade Fire. They're an interesting band with a style that's hard to define, and a great first 2 albums. I think I may have been 14 when I heard "The Funeral", and it was unlike anything I've heard. I was excited when The Neon Bible came out, and when I heard it, I was on the floor.		Unfortunately The Suburbs is boring and uninspired in comparison here. There's about maybe 3 songs on here that of worthy of listening to over and over, and the rest is all repetitive. I swear after track 2 I was wondering if my vinyl copy was broken/problematic, because it's so damned repetitive. Almost all the tracks have the same pattern of "start off slow/start music about a minute in/delay vocals 30 seconds after/verse/chorus/bridge/chorus/verse/chorus/long end". That, plus Butler's whining is becoming just plain annoying to the point where I wanna superglue his lips together to make sure he doesn't make that grating noise, ever.		We Used To Wait, Empty Room and Suburban war are the 3 tracks that are worthy of listening to, and the rest is boring and repetitive doss. A major disappointment.

The MOST idiotic thing is that they don't even give you a choice to download it straight to your computer after you buy itit HAS to go through this useless process.  The thing doesn't even allow you to select to open the folder the music is stored in!  AND on top of that you have to deal with TONS of annoying bugs and glitches, some of which makes you completely stuck, even after re-opening the app, and often makes you have to just completely re-install the it.	***It should be a given that if you purchase a song and select it to download that you *DO_NOT* want it to go directly to some pain in the butt software that for 1, is ALWAYS has some type of super annoying bug and 2, is purely a unnecessary and just a straight up hassle.***  For the pathetic amazon music player I give it 1 star, if I could I would give it a -5 score rating.  I couldn't find anywhere where I can review the music player so Im leaving it here.
1,Did not order, don't know why it is showing up on my account.
1,Look, I like Ingrid Michaelson but honestly this is more of the same. She seems to be unable to write lyrically thoughtful songs. All are her songs are rather juvenile and asinine pop ditties (The Way I Am, Be Ok, Maybe). I was really hoping to see some artistic growth but I'm sad to say this ain't it. "Girls chase boys chase girls." Really?!
1,Sorry but this album is by no stretch a quality record and the beats are horrific probably 20% of the album good. I don't see why people are raving about this record because it's not even close to a new classic and iggy azalea lacks greatness compared to other female rappers and being the face of T.I.'s hustle gang she's garbage and yeah go ahead and call out that busta asap rocky cause their both wack.
1,This item will not install on my Kindle Fire and I can't delete it from my device. I get an error message telling me it incurred a problem during download and to try again later. It's been about 2 months now and still won't install or download. If you have a first edition Kindle Fire, don't bother.
1,I would not even download it for free.		This is another example of why "country" music is so horrible today.  It is no longer "country" music, it is just pop with slide guitars.		Johny Cash is rolling over in his grave, Willie Nelson is smoking more and more to drown out this junk, and Hank Williams is yodeling louder and louder to not have to hear this.
1,Which is great if you like classic music. If not, you won't find much here. I'd really expected to here the classics i grew up on, but didn't like much of this.
1,Was looking for the version from Belly soundtrack...not it, but my mom likes it.
1,Tried something a little different than what I usually listen to; glad I did not pay for this song.  Not my favorite.
1,Stupid.
1,I didn't like this music. Maybe someone else taste , but not mine.
1,There is honestly a lack from female singers of today. They sincerely have not made songs that drove from the soul of the heart, and instead have had a lot of songs that really have been more cheesy than a strike from the soul within. Honestly, there can be more patience to make a song strike well. Demi Lovato has had only a few songs that worked very nicely from that place, like Skyscraper and some other ones. But honestly, she has tried to be more in your face in the way other artists like Beyonce' Knowles and Rihanna have been, and sadly she has lagged from a strong inner soul. Her latest song, Confident, the second track and title track from third album is definitely a song that I didn't feel was a strong presence. Instead the song has been more of a waste than Cool For The Summer was. I really found this song to be one of her weakest songs overall. I hope the next single can bring out more confidence from the lack on the soul that this one showed.		Song: D
1,I really was disappointed by the song
1,I did not like this song, even though I usually like ballads
1,I really don't like this song. Voice cracks too much when saying keep keep bleeding.
1,I cannot concentrate on the words in the song because of the horrible beat that backs up the song.  This is garbage.
1,i  never received my order. It is not in my music library in my kindle. ;(
1,I love this song so much that I  purchased it without realizing the (Explicit) warning. Why in the world would anyone ruin such a pretty song with one dumb statement said before the song even starts. What is this world coming to? Now I have to go back and buy the (clean version). I guess I shouldn't say I have to buy it again, but, I love Mr. Mars and think he's very talented and fresh so....
1,Were it not for the Hell Yeah CD by Black 'N Blue that I purchased at the same time as Rockaholic, I would criticize this more but after listening to how a terrible a CD can actually be, I will say that at least I didn't frisbee this into the trash. Instead, I kep the case and dropped the CD in the trash.
1,not good
1,my friend was just trying to find random free songs. I don't even know why she downloaded this one. I was pretty confused.
1,This track wasn't worth the price paid: It was free!
1,I was very dissatisfied with cd.
1,Album seems like it was put together in a hurry.  Nowhere near as good as their first album, which is to be expected.  But this is an enormous step back.  Has a lot of yelling, loud lyrics, lacking enjoyable sing alongs.
1,love music and work in Music Publishing, I do not like only.playing this on computer.  Not phone or play on CD in car or stereo
1,This is such a retread that Madame Gaga who i like,has me dumbfounded. Madonna approves of this song apparently. It must be because she is vain  enough to want a copy kat of Express Yourself. No costume  can cover up this fact.	The woman does not sing that well on this either,even though she boasts about her chops. A big seller already,and not original .
1,song was great Amazon does NOT let you download the MP3 more than once. So IF you happen to delete it or LOSE it like I did by aaccident. You are screwed. Will not buy MP3 from amazon again.
1,At forty-five, Redman (Reginald Noble) of Def Squad, Hit Squad and Red & Meth is much older than the new guard of hip-hop, but he doesn't sound like a wheezing, beleaguered old man at all. Some of his '90s-edge has escaped him, but for the most part, he still sounds like the same old Redman, except what relevance does he serve in today's growing and competitive rap landscape? His reputation would suggest that it's near impossible to picture the merry and mean emcee hopping on some erudite conscious tip, and that's exactly what he doesn't do on Mudface (Nov. 13), his eighth solo LP and his first album not on Def Jam Recordings. The followup to 2010's Reggie, Mudface is instead catered by Red's Gilla House Records, and it's obvious the Def Jam panache is missing. The hard truth is that though his veteran hall of fame status in the game is vaulted for good, he just isn't the hottest ticket in town anymore, and on top of that, on Mudface, he shows no new angles and just doesn't outdo himself.		Despite its too many shortcomings, Mudface does house the fun, wild unmediated jollies Redman has always been known to get his rocks off with, but now, name-dropping celebrities, referencing pop culture, partying in the club, smoking his grade A stash, and belting out a few namesake catchword anthems is not going to make the cut. The Gilla House posse song "Undeniable" is nice, but it's unlikely the beginning of a super group. "Bars" contains some of the best lyrics on the album, but Redman should have gone that hard lyrically on the rest of the tracks. What remains is medium well wordplay in flawless moderato obsequious to Redman's well established formula.		Sadly, the production is also poorly innovative, a music relic of Red's heyday that bypassed the necessary sound upgrades, giving us a trip back in time that we don't necessarily need. This is clean content compared to the controversial hip-hop material of the present, making Red an option for today's kids that parents might let slide. Redman pokes fun at enough new phenomena and landmark events that came about since Reggie to give Mudface an intriguingly current timeliness, and he will no doubt attract a few new fans, but in short, the album is short (thirteen tracks clocking in at thirty-four minutes) with fading fortunes, no surprises and no brilliant answer to the question, 'So what?' in regards to the purpose and importance of the album. Let's just hope Blackout 3 and Muddy Waters 2 actually come out, save the man's reputation and give him more of the respect he so deserves.
1,There was only one decent song on the "Greatest Hits" Maybe I'm not a "Earth Wind & Fire" fan
1,Not what I wanted. Wrong wording.
1,the music sucks only got it because it was free
1,Great being able to buy old music via MP3, and the price was excellent.  Love the cloud player options for downloading purchased music to phone or computer.  However, I was disappointed because it wasn't the version they play on the radio.
1,Once again Amazon Digital purchase has failed me.  The song cuts out in the middle, skips a few words and continues, totally sucks.  Please refund.
1,I kind of mind, when I think of my sister, daughter or mother. WTF are we teaching kids these days. I don't care for usher like I once did. He's wasting his talent or maybe run out of good ideas?
1,With the surprise success of Slumdog Millionaire winning Best Picture at the Oscars, there always can be a sense of overexposure with a song from a film that can be a dereailment. That is said strongly with this remade version of Jai Ho! as a single from The Pussycat Dolls. I found this song to lack the appeal and feeling of the song than what really was strong from the movie. It feels like The Pussycat Dolls have made the feeling of the song lose its original luster. I really didn't find this song to be at all appealing. I really think it is absolutely sad that the days from the strength of the song from a movie has lost its ways than the last decade where the song and its soundtrack were just as mighty. I hope that there can be a better mix the next time I hear a movie song.		Song: D
1,not a fan previous album way better
1,Please sit down ok! It's noise not music!
1,I did not purchase this, but it was put on my cloud accidentally. They do well in "Tears on my Pillow" but not on this one. They had a few good hits, but not this one. They were a decent group overall.
1,floats in and out of your earhole, be it in an elevator somewhere or some department store. kind of like a scentless, inoffensive fart
1,I honestly hate this record with every fiber of my being.
1,Where have all the flowers gone? Hmm I would say they wilted and died from this boring song. Why I purchased this one will always amaze me? I guess it was just a blue day and this song certainly did not lift my spirits.
1,I thought it couldn't get any worse when I heard some of Lil Waynes stuff, but then I listened to Soulja Boy. My god what garbage. Can you imagine if the collaborated? Horrible horrible song.
1,There is no question when it has came down to Katy Perry, she has definitely been known more for trying to be a pussycat in music, than trying to ignite with sex appeal in voice. She shown that shallowing down with her marriage Russell Brand ending late last year. But her trying to get back into music with her next album, doesn't seem like a far cry, it feels more like a waste to the ears with her lead single from the upcoming record Prism is definitely a waste upon the ears. Katy has definitely lost her talent in her voice, as she tries to make her own version of the Sara Bareilles song Brave. She sounds more like a whimper of herself than someone who can ignite, like she did to her fans with California Gurls. I think Katy should go back to square one with her voice, than ignite something new.		Song: D-
1,its alright for what it was back in the time that it was recorded but skips a little yup it
1,I was disappointed in this album. I really bought it only for one song, but hoped that other songs would be equally interesting. They aren't.
1,I don't even know why I purchased this song. I guess for the laughs at how bad it is?
1,I did not realize this was different than the one I hear on the radio - don't know why thay bothered when they had a great song and this version took the power out of the regular version just so he could cuss. It will be a while before I would get another of their songs - it would really have to be something special. I will erase it from my library because the music was ruined, not by the words but the terrible music quality.
1,This "remaster" is HORRIBLE!!! How this can even be put up for sale is pretty shameful. The music is pushed so far back and tinny while the lead vocals are in your face and backing muffled and far away. Just bad bad bad.
1,Given the fact that he was the lead singer of one of the biggest R&B boy bands of the 21st century, one would think that Omarion would have a better carrer. However after a good first album, he followed it up with the equally bad 21 which did nothing to show off his vocal talent. With Olluison, Omarion is singing songs that truly show he was and always will be nothing more than a studio singer.
1,I have been loyal to Trent Reznor and his NIN projects, but this is by far a big dissapointment.  Thank goodness it was reasonably priced. I just don't find this groundbreaking at all. More canned music.  If your strapped for cash, skip this album.  Get a good one like the downward spital, or broken
1,Embedded DRM prevents burning Amazon.com downloaded MP3 to a CD. Digital player only.  I do not recommend these downloads for this reason.
1,Katy Perry's second hit song, is very......catchy but it's annoying.		It's one of those songs you can't help but hum certain parts to and the video is just....well, it's just there. I thought the ladies dancing with the umbrellas or whatever was kinda cool the first time I saw it but I was wrong.		This song is just the flavor of the week and when I first heard it I didn't like it. It's gotten a bit better since then but don't expect this to win any grammies, LOL		2.5 stars.
1,The additional material is nice, but the remaster is absolute trash. I never bothered to listen to this remaster until this evening. Other reviewers fo this version here are spot-on. It's near ruined and unlistenable in comparison to the original. Punch-you-in-the-face, loudness. The mix is totally flat, the cymbals and hat are trashed. Just garbage. The only thing this has going for it is that is sound like what the album would have if Kurt has destroyed it along with his on-stage guitars... fitting maybe.
1,For such a "much anticipated" return to the recording studio by this legendary superband which dominated the radio in the 70's and 80's, this effort falls short of expectations.  While there are a number of highlight moments on this CD, including an energetic "90 Degrees and Freezing", a Motown-inspired, horn driven "Come to Me Do" and a catchy and powerful pop gem "Feel" (all penned by all-time great songwriter Robert Lamm), the record suffers from an over-abundance of ballads and sorry, over-blown production. I'm not a producer, but I know what sounds good to my ears.	I have nothing against some ballads on a Chicago album, but the ones on this Chicago album, the first recording of all-original material in 15 years, are simply not good, whether from a songwriting or performance standpoint. I won't go down the list, but will cite "King of Might Have Been" as an example of bassist Jason Scheff's mostly able tenor painfully straining to hit notes out of his range.	I don't know what producer Jay DeMarcus was thinking in putting this together as a Chicago CD, but the end result is a lot of tracks sounding like his own band, Rascal Flatts. No more to say as this speaks for itself.  As confirmed by the band, DeMarcus was also responsible for choosing the material for the recording, and pushed aside many songs written by the band members in favor of the mostly trite fare that shows up on "XXX". Considering that Robert Lamm and Bill Champlin have proven they can still pen solid pop/rock/R&B songs as found on their string of solo recordings, a CD of Chicago-only songs would, undoubtably been more listenable and a more worthy end product than what we hear on "XXX".	Finally, DeMarcus uses an army of studio musicians in place of the actual band members, thereby destroying any integrity this album would have had at least as a document of a Chicago band performance.	"Chicago XXX" "could have been a contender" with a different approach to the CD's production.  We'll just have to wait for "Chicago XXXI".
1,Nothing special about the song. Can't stand the singer at all.	Yuck. This ain't the one but her husband got away free at last !
1,When it has deeply came right down to Beyonce', she has honestly been one of the most overexposed artists in music history. Not only with I Am Sasha Fierce, but when you release too many singles from an album, it gets kind of annoying and you want to go to somewhere else. Her lastest single Why Don't You Love Me from the extended version of I Am Sahsa Fierce isn't honestly a very strong song at all. When I truthfully saw the video, I thought it was weak as a mouse. But the song really isn't Beyonce' at her best nor is it a good song. I think she should truthfully take a break, find a new creative source for her music and her sound and come back in a while to find something better to give to her fans. Why Don't You Love Me, the answer is very simple. It is a bit of overexposure to what Beyonce' has given. She really didn't give her best this time around.		Song: D
1,I love the two singles, Spin and Out of Breath, so I thought I'd download this first and give it a try.  As much as I hate to give an album with meaningful lyrics such a low rating, I have no other choice.  Sorry to all you hardcore fans, but this didn't cut it!  I tried to like this album and I still couldn't get into a lot of these songs!  There's too many slow, sleep  inducing tracks!  I can get the same thing from my relaxation CD!!  Not even the bonus track How Long is worth the extra money!  I gave this two stars for the five songs I like:  Spin, Sky Is Falling, Am I Ever Gonna Find Out, Out Of Breath, and Take Me Away.  My advice:  Go ahead, if you're a hardcore fan!  If you're just a casual fan like me, just download it or borrow it from a friend!  And while you're at it, try No Name Face instead!  So far, I've only heard sound clips, but it still seems like a better album than this!
1,this song is bs it should have negative 50 zizlliiiion stars
1,Basically this cd is not good to me. I rank this cd with some of his worse efforts. The guitar playing is very good though and showcases itself perhaps more than any other Prince cd with consistent solos.  It is obvious Prince had an after party mentality for funk on this cd, but somehow he missed the mark.  It is not a horrible cd it just does not make you ever feel like dancing or caring to play that one song over and over.  Some of the guitar rifts are excellent though.	Okay after two weeks of listening to the cd I can ease up a bit and say here are the best songs on the albums to me rated 1-10.	Here- I give a number 7.  I really liked this song but it took a while to grow on me. It really wasn't till I listened to the lyrics clearly. I listened to this song more than any other.  It has a carousel feel to it sorta of like Dionne from The Truth Cd's but in lyrics it's more reminiscent to The Dance on 3121 and Strange Relationship from SOTT)	Dance For Me-I give a number 6(Reminiscent of 319 off Gold but a little better b/c).  His voice sticks in your head and I like the beat. This is a good Prince song.	U're Gonna C Me- I say it's a 9 but we've already heard this so I give it a 7.6.  (I have to lower the number for remixes b/c imagine anyone else redoing a song of their own and putting it on an album)	Chocolate Box-I give a 5.  I would give a 6 but it sounds like it should be played in a gay bar and I'm a man so I can only dig it but so far. His voice sticks in your head with this song. If he came out with this in the 80's it woulda been a hit but it's 2009.	Crimson and Clover-I give a 4 just because I can and if you're Prince and you're gonna do a cover song it has to be great, but that guitar rift bumps it up to a 5.	$- I give a 5.  Definitely reminiscent of MovieStar off Crystal Ball.	77 Beverly Park- I give an eight.  It's only an instrumental though, but it's probably the best song on the 2 cd's.	Colonized Mind-I give a 4 compared to Money Don't Matter, SOTT,  When Will We Be Paid, Avalanche,Planet Earth, and his other political songs. He does have a couple lines in this song worth being heard though and the comparisons of a child with no mother equals a man with no feeling make you think.	Overall this cd is okay.  Even with his funny electro voice it just didn't do it. Like everyone we all expect a lot out of Prince while at the same time trying to lower our expectations, but this cd is just okay.  I can think of too many of his other cd's that are far better but he does have a couple songs that are catchy.  He definitely caught a vibe on this cd, it's just I didn't catch it.  Like I said, it sounds like takes from an afterparty or a B-sides cd. It did not feel like an album.  By this I mean think Dave Chappelle's sketches compared to his stand up or a television show compared to a movie.  I feel like he wanted to be funky on this cd and it came across but it just wasn't stankonia.
1,Maybe you need to be high to like this one.  I don't get it.  As a DJ,  I figure the kids will request it though.  They haven't yet.  Maybe they have better taste than I thought.  I still don't don't know why "Gas Pedal" is popular!  I thought this would be one like that.  Not much content,  but nevertheless a hit.  Go figure!
1,This is NOT a piece of music.		It is only used for tuning up an orchestra or instrument.		Unless you want to tune your musical instrument, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.		All this is is a single tone, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.
1,this sounds just like country the s***ty song sounds somebody dirving its pissing me off and also i hate the picture it looks FAKE
1,Has a nice beat and is easy to dance to. I give it a rating based upon my tastes. Your mileage may differ!
1,This is awful.  Levine should remove all his tattoos and get a sex change.  His vocals sound auto tuned and do not reflect how great his ability really is.  This should be listed with girly teen pop crap!
1,A freebie from our friends at Amazon.  I always enjoy a good freebie, it is a great way to try things.
1,When it has came down to Rihanna, she has been one of the most cornball artists of the past several years. Yet, her songs have made her very annoying, and not really a strong singer. She really has became so oversaturated after Umbrella, and now it has became more tiring hearing her music than a blessing. Her latest single from her album Talk That Talk, You Da One is absolutely poor. She really doesn't have the strike in her voice that she once had awhile ago. I honestly think Rihanna needs to definitely take a very long break from singing and find herself as a growing woman all over again. After what went through with Chris Brown over 2 years ago, she really has let her songs go to thin, and now she is not da one.		Song: D-
1,The original of a song is usually better than any subsequent attempt by others to do the same track-- and that's definitely true for this song. To each their own opinion, but Thomas Rhett did this song perfectly. Nelly has some songs of his own that are ok, but he needs to stay out of country and do an original song of his own.
1,I'll admit I am Beyonce fan and somewhat of a Justin fan but this remix, yes REMIX is terrible. Now, While Beyonce's Vocals are great and on point, Justin's remain the same as his original which for me, throws me off since they called it a "Duet". My opinion : if it was really a duet, Justin's vocals would be new, also. So, it's more of a remix than a duet. I Think if Justin had new vocals for the song, it would be more enjoyable.		This would have been a lot better, in my opinion had it contained new vocals from JT
1,CRAP CRAPCRAP double crap.... crap on a bun crap to slap.... don't buy it in my opinion.  UGLY UGLY.UGLY. Extremely UGLY.
1,Had to buy for a video!
1,Six seconds of a four-note whistle- this is what you people are wetting yourselves over?  I could get my neighbor's kid to whistle into my laptop mic and no one would be the wiser.  You'd think they'd need to release an actual track or even a cue to work with, but given the gushing fanboi/gurl reactions to this little bit of nothing with a logo attached Barnum still has it right: there's one born every minute.
1,Ty
1,Is this an Irish sea chanty?  Kept thinking of Steve Martin's "Housesitter"...  nice harmony though...  my wife is listening and saying she cannot understand what they are saying...
1,I'm clearing off my review list. This was a purchase for someone who WANTED it. Thus, they liked it. I personally am not a fan.		I'd turn my nose up at this by the name alone. I'm southern and I DETEST the promotion of "hillbilly" or "Red neck" ideas/ideals. To me southern is simplicity, relaxation, a charm and sophistication with manners and poise, and GOOD food (that may kill you off at 40)
1,I never recieved the download and is not able to retrieve it from my library.
1,One would expect this collection to be pure enjoyment since it has MORRISON teaming up with some great artists and songs.		It's not.
1,Never like her first single and never like this song at all !	Quit hogging all the airplay and let the other artists shine for once.	Please stop making music. Purchase my albums instead , you'll thank me later.
1,I am more disappointed in Amazon than the music.  This is not the original recording.  It is very good; the voices are very similar to the original, but they are definitely NOT original.  So I will listen to the song, but will always feel a bit ripped off.  This version appeared at the top search list. Note the parentheses in the title:  Originally.....  Reading quickly I thought "original," a slightly deceptive title.  I would give the original recording five stars as a wonderful ballad.  But not this one.  It's probably better than 2 stars, but I took off a star because of the slightly deceptive sales tactic.
1,This bands sucks, cannot sing, have crap beats, butcher good songs from Zeppelin & the Crue and just sound like ten year olds trying to be no talent rappers.  I hope Zeppelin and the Crue have these no talent losers killed after they hear the total mockery of their timeless hits.
1,Um... ok I'm [not] sorry, but this album is NOT that great. What are y'all listening to?? I wanna listen to that album! Like damn		No but seriously...I love Drake, and I love rap, but this album is painfully boring.	Not even the track "Used To" with Wayne is good	"6 Man" might be one of the worst hip-hop tracks I've ever heard	"6PM in New York" is WACK and I don't think it flows at all	And is Drake even ON "Wednesday Night Interlude"...?		There are a FEW songs (as in 3 or 4, tops) on the album that are OK, such as "Energy" and "Know Yourself"...		But overall, NWTS is 1,000 times better.
1,no
1,this is just not the type of music i was looking for for Halloween at all super annoying and dumb
1,I have analyzed the Rush track "Subdivisions" with digital audio workstation software and have determined that this version has been altered from its original sound.  Hold on to your original "Signals" CD for the best sound!
1,purchased for someone else.
1,It's just a preference. It's not my cup of tea that's all. Too heavy going for young children i think.
1,Has a nice beat and is easy to dance to. I give it a rating based upon my tastes. Your mileage may differ!
1,On first listen, suckage.	I get that artists in general reinvent themselves (JEKYLL + HYDE) but man, I was not expecting this.  I was SUPER excited because my all time Favorite gal Sara Bareilles is on here and also Chris Cornell whom I enjoy.  I listened to Sara's song and thought what is this, Jazz?	Chris Cornell is rock and WAY off for me.	The majority of the album has a serious pop beat and does nothing for me.  I always thought of ZBB as one of the stead-fast modern times true country bands. I also miss a lot of the harmonies they have had in the previous albums	1) Beautiful Drug- Pop	2) Loving You Easy- more country with a pop beat	3) Remedy- more true to the ZBB sound	4) Homegrown- this is the first country single off the album and is more rock to me than country	5) Mango Tree- feat Sara Bareilles- Jazzy- starts with heavy horns in the begining	6) Heavy is the Head- feat. Chris Cornell- Rock.	7) Bittersweet- slower paced more country feel	8) Castaway- are we trying to be Jimmy Buffett and Kenny Chesney?	9) Tomorrow Never Comes- does have a country feel to it.	10) One Day- more Buffett	11) Dress Blues- more of a country pace.  This is actually a lyrically great song.	12) Young and Wild- synthetic rock beat.	13) Junkyard- I am not sure what this is but I cannot stomach more than 15 seconds of it. and its over 7 minutes long.	14) I'll be your man (Song for a Daughter)- I love the lyrics in this song, its beautiful.  Set more to an islandy beat but great ZBB harmonies	15) Wildfire- more synthetic stuff.  Good beat though.	16) Tomorrow Never Comes-Acoustic- and an acoustic version of song above.	This is just one music lovers opinion.  I don't really need much flack from my opinion, we all have one- have a great day.
1,Not my kind of music
1,The song is great. However the post mastering of the song left a high pitch screech in certain areas of the song starting with	"Miami beach..." then "I've seen....", fancy, limousines, etc. Too many places to list. I tried a new download and it still is wrong.	This would make me hate a song I so enjoy.
1,Free music
1,Given that I lost interest in Manson after GAOG, I still gave his last few releases a fair shot...and I was not the least bit impressed.  Eat Me Drink Me was a disaster, The High End of Low was disappointing especially since Twiggy was involved again, Born Villain was more of the same if the last album....and now there is this album.  Still not impressed even after a few close listens.  His voice didn't improve with age. The music arrangements are average at best.  And....Where is Twiggy on this album?  Is he in the band anymore?  He is not credited on the album.		This is arguably the fourth album in a row from "Manson the man", rather than "Manson the band".
1,It was 99 cents. What can I say? I bought it and I like about three or four songs on here. Let's Talk is probably my favorite, which is odd because I enjoy almost the entire Wale CD.
1,So do we really need to hear this? I guess if you are an Al Kooper fan, there is some merit, although, the Kooper kuts here were done better and more dramatically with BS&T. Bloomfield never impressed me much, so he has that NY Long Island playing style that worked in the Catskills, but came off as less than convincing outside that circuit. Stills? Please. What was the first side of this record was made stronger by virtue of the fact that Stills turned in a workmanlike effort. Sure, played hard, not much to show for it. I do suspect that this effort was the nascent arrival of an insufferable ego that would only undermine him as time wore on.	Give credit to the remastering crew, though. You can hear pristinely how overwrought every note on this disc is. The 2002 remixes are a waste on top of something as thoroughly unnecessary as anything I've ever heard. Caveat emptor (that's let the buyer beware for all of you from LI).
1,When it has came down to Britney Spears and her music, she doesn't seem to have the spark to match younger artists like Taylor Swift or Jennifer Hudson with voice. Britney has not made very good songs for the films either. It has been a very long time since she had a song hit the movies since her work with the lackluster Crossroads. She has decided to give it another whirl with Ooh La La, the lead single from the film The Smurfs 2. Surprisingly, the song didn't feel like it had ignited in the spirit for The Smurfs. It felt more like it had ignited with Britney pears fans, but not really a song that delivered in its strength. If you are a die hard Britney Spears fan, than you'll definitely want to download this song, but I didn't like it because it didn't have enough in the heart.		Song: D
1,This is not the Zac Brown I fell in love with. Much like Daughtrys last cd it seems all too many great bands follow the pop road and change their sound to appease more people. This cd is a huge let down.
1,"He popped all my buttons, and he ripped my blouse/He Monica Lewinsky-ed all on my gown"- very feral, primal lyrics. Again, this type of music is to attract the lowest common denominator. To attract the brainless masses who blindly idolize oblivious to the fact that the emperor has no clothes (or, shall we say The B!tch has no real talent) Get a grip, mindless Beyonce zombies, smell the coffee! Can't you smell a turd from a mile away? when it took seven people to write the song and six producers. If that doesn't bear the pungent stench of doo, then what?		Terius "The Dream" Nash 	Beyonc Knowles 	Justin Timberlake 	Timothy Mosley 	Jerome Harmon 	Dwane Weir 	Mike Dean		Producer(s)		Timbaland 	Jerome "J-Roc" Harmon 	Justin Timberlake 	Beyonc 	Key Wane 	Mike Dean 	Boots
1,ex husband hacked into account and ordered them. No idea how it is working.
1,I love the band and the music so much that I had to download this song. However, like so many times in the past, Amazon can't deliver good/quality mp3's to me. Half (about 20) of the mp3's I've downloaded from Amazon have audio artifacts/defects and glitches. I report them to Amazon and they refund money to me and say they will fix the problem. Weeks later I'll attempt to download the song again and it will still be defective. I've grown tired of this and have decided to avoid Amazon mp3's all together and will take my business to Itunes instead. Also, I thought it might be my system, but it hasn't failed with any other mp3 provider or download service - plus I recently installed a new, state of the art router. FIX YOUR PROBLEMS AMAZON!
1,Love her voice
1,The remake by tiny tim is 1,0000 times better than the original. the truth hurts folks get use to it.
1,Just not my type of music. If you like metal you might like this! Music is all a personal choice and mine isn't metal.
1,But not this!!  Only one song is actually good and that is track #5.  I love you Ru but you can do better than this.
1,If this is the best song in the 2000's you are sadly mistaken. Anything from this "artist" should not be bought.	Avoid beyonce at all cost. Instead buy my albums on itunes you'll thank me later.
1,As Snoop Dogg & Wiz Khalifa team up for an album/soundtrack, they released the first single YOung Wild & Free.  People like to make fun of Drake for making soft songs but this one right here is one of the softest songs of the year.  The beat has no thump whatsoever and sounds like that Cee Lo Green Coca Cola commercial from a few years back.  Very happy sounding.  The entire vibe of the song reminds me of cuddling under rainbows eating marshmallows and sipping Moscato with Natasha Bedingfield singing Pocketful of Sunshine.  Surely these guys can do better than this.
1,once i saw the video, everything i felt about this song changed..
1,This is supposed to be an accompaniment track (no voices).  However, it's the original song.  I previously purchased the original, and was looking for the version without voices for a memorial DVD.  Ended up with an adequate version from another company (Christian Rock, the Best of. . .).
1,The song was beautiful but it disappeared after purchasing and listening for a couple days.  will not purchase another song like this
1,ha ha- definitely this song fits the comedy/parody song genre perfectly. Lyrics are kinda in line with 2 Live Crew's Me So Whore Knee or Chuck Berry's My Ding A Ling (i love Chuck though, this is probably 1 of his songs that i care the least for). Just goes to show you, people will make any crappy song popular (ie Whoot, There It Is) This is like the Whoot There It Is for the new generation
1,UPDATED REVIEW:	This review is similar to one I will write for a number of new albums and is essentially a statement.		It seems that more and more record labels are choosing NOT to include digital downloads with vinyl purchases which I think is absolutely unacceptable given that the cost of the album on vinyl is usually more than *double* that of a CD or straight digital download, and because recording a vinyl to digital format is a bit of a pain when compared to ripping a CD. I was happy years ago when more and more labels began offering digital downloads with the purchase of a record, but that seems to have changed with the popularity of vinyl again increasing steadily. When you factor in that the cost of vinyl has been increasing right along with that popularity with no added benefits other than the label receiving more money then I get angry. Of the past 4 albums I've purchased, 3 have not included a digital tracks from lables Shanachie Entertainment, Not Now Music, and even freaking RCA.		My apologies for the 2-star review, but this needs to change. Not Now Music should offer a digital download and I"ll revise my review to reflect the album rather than what I did not receive. I'm just tired of this and will simply resort to streaming or pirating album releases that don't provide what has become expected and standard in the past decade, simple as that. If hosting and bandwidth resources are at the crux of these cutbacks then just include a simple paper-sleeved CD instead as some labels have done for quite a while. And, if that is still too much cost, forgo the "fashionable" heavy weight, double LP release for a simple, more cost-effective single LP release. Double LP, 120g albums are almost always unnecessary anyway and take up too much space on my shelf let alone having to flip the record twice as often.		Here ends my rant. I'm not going to buy albums at these prices any longer if this is the direction we're heading. At double or TRIPLE the price of a CD, digital tracks are nothing but a courtesy. Period.		ORIGINAL REVIEW:	Near Perfection - One of my favorite collections in any genre, from any artist. The 3 LP vinyl is gorgeous and masterfully done. Whoever rated this one star for not being a 'live' album should be banned from Amazon.
1,the music sucks only got it because it was free
1,I thought this song would just go away and stop hogging all the airplay.	This is not a dream its a nightmare. Completely bland and annoying.	She must be stopped !
1,Rihanna is really 'hit or miss' with her songs.  She either makes songs that are very catchy (in a good way), like "Umbrella" or she makes some unlistenable dreck like "Cheers (Drink to that)".  She seldom has songs you would be ambivalent about.  However, "Stay" (with Mikky Ekko) is just such a song.		  "Stay" is meant to be an emotional ballad of loving and longing, but it's turgid music and Rihanna's whiny vocals (a problem she has in to many of her songs), don't make this a particularly enjoyable song.
1,I had not bought an album of Emmylou Harris music in years and I was in Barnes and Nobel the other day and was looking for something good to listen to.  I saw her name and thought yes, that is what I want.  They had several to pick from but I chose this one based on the cover, which I thougth was interesting.  BIG MISTAKE.  This is nothing like the Emmylou from years gone by.  I understand that you need to re-invent yourself sometimes to reach new and younger fans but you must remain true to yourself too.  This was not my cup of tea by any means and I found the songs boring, loud and her sweet voice covered up by the music.  I was very disappointed and wondered what had made her choose this route.  Well I hope she has not forgotten her older true fans who put her on top in the first place.  Wake up Emmylou.
1,The Wolf is a total rip off of Delta Spirit's Bushwick Blues!

1,ok
1,meh
1,When it has came down to Katy Perry, she just hasn't had a universal song that has delivered from the voice alone. Her music has gotten to be cheap, and not of tone from the heart. She expanded her 2010 album Teenage Dream which sold very well, and added some songs that really cheapened the drive of the album. Wide Awake is honestly one of the songs, and honestly the song is not really exciting or driven. I was not very impressed with the song. It was not as appealing as her earlier songs showed to everyone like California Gurls did. I think Katy should take more time and find better in her voice, than just rushing music out that cheapens her style. That can make you fall asleep faster.		Song: D
1,Ignore the Saint Motel and Arctic Monkeys song reviews I made, even though they do sucks to extremes, this is definitely the worst song ever. Yeah, you heard me call the Saint Motel song 'Bonafide Trash', but at least that song hasn't been bothering me too much even though I don't want to hear it again. But this song sucks so scathingly bad that I don't even want to say anything good about it. The album it is on is even bad for this song. The whistling melody in the beginning of and throughout this entire song is the most avoidable thing in musical audio to ever be created. So do the melodies of the lyrics, but let's just stop with the musical reasons why this song sucks and get to some other chaos. Everything that uses this song is equally as bad just for using this song, especially that Supercuts commercial. Because this song deserves no attention. It does not deserve to have any good things said about it. It is so bad that I would take this song out of existence and into the Devils wrath, because that where it belongs. Fitz and The Tantrums need to disband because they suck big time. Listen to CHVRCHES and The Neighbourhood instead of this trash.
1,It is honestly so sad when a artist has became so overexposed, that they haven't been able to shine the way the used to when they were younger. Unfortunately, Beyonce' Knowles has been one of those artists that has been so severely overplayed, and overexposed like a robot that is too much, that she has just been not worth listening to anymore. The only talent she had was when she was a part of Destiny's Child. But on her own, she has oversaturated the market where it has been too much about her, and no one else. When she was starting to get out on her own, she had one or two songs, but that was it. Her collaborations with her husband though, not even exciting. Her song Deja Vu from her 2005 album B' Day, has not been impressive, trying to recapture the chemistry she one had with him on Crazy In Love, and sadly she does not impress at all. I really did not enjoy the song, and sadly it is not worth listening to, especially when it has been overplayed so many times. If you are really new to Beyonce' Knowles music, go back and listen to when she did have talent as a part of Destiny's Child.		Song: D+
1,I truly did not want to believe that this was one of my beloved favorites, Rick Springfield murdering each and every song on this album, but a person can only go so far on denial. In my case delusion didn't even make it through the first track, and by the time I trudged on through to the end I only got really, really sad.		I didn't know that Rick could suck.		This album is a massacre. It should be taken away, hidden, and hopefully forgotten.
1,This track wasn't worth the price paid: It was free!
1,Here's the deal...The lyrics are good and the song ain't bad (check out Youtube sensation Christina Grimmie's stripped down version on Youtube). What I hate is the production and arrangement. Record producers for these major record labels are pressured to make everything in the style of all the other top 40 songs. It makes the song sound like another Lady Gaga wanna be, which is a shame because it's not a bad song at all.
1,I give this a 2 because I don't remember listening to this at all. It is probably an okay song though.
1,Overplayed and overrated.
1,There is no question that sometimes there can be too much exposure of an artist, that it does honestly feel like it can be more tiresome and bothered than it really was before. That honestly is the case with Lady Gaga. She has had so much overexposure, that it feels like the organic appeal of her songs has honestly lost their welcome. That honestly is the case with her latest song Alejandro, from The Fame Monster. I really didn't find the some to be anything really special nor strong. It really felt like she was taking the page from Madonna with Gag's take on style of La Isla Bonita. Sadly for Lady Gaga, the song really isn't a definitive song for her. I think she really should try and give her fans absolutely something new, and go away for awhile. Alejandro didn't have the spanish guitar worth singing to.		Song: D+
1,I don't like a  "live version" of a song on my computer. After I realized I did purchase a "live" song, I deleted it.  This is no reflection on the song itself.
1,Christian's don't buy ! not Christian band Mastodon
1,This song was not a bad, song, or one that would drive most people nuts...itwas nothing like that & maybe that is why I did not care for it.		All I can really say about it is, this song is just not my kind of music. I like REO Speedwagon, Journey, Elton John, traditional Irish Music & jigs, etc...this was none of that.		It was a very easy listening type of Music...elevator music if you will...I know that there are people that like that kind of music, and if you are one of them, then you will prolly like this...but it's just not my style of music.		I give it 2 stars...and I'm being generous.
1,the music sucks only got it because it was free
1,I'm sorry, but this is not a song. It is noise condensed into a format that can be played on any media player...don't get!
1,For Britney Spears, her life has really been placed on too much overdrive. With her perfromance recently on Good Morning America, and her recent documentary on MTV Britney: For The Record, she has shown that she has been more unhappy not having control over her life, than her career coming to full force. That is shown on her latest single Circus, the second songle and title track from her latest album. She doesn't feel like she has captured a new essence to that next level. The song feels like it rehashed from the beats from her earlier material like I'm A Slave For U. I really felt like she has run out of songs, and her feeling is that she just doesn't want to sing anymore. I think she needs to put time off from her career, and get those loose ends of her life together.		Song: D
1,AAA
1,The E.P was kinda boring. The songs sounded like a Buckingham E.P, his notes weren't good and a couple of sangs all you heard in them were the chorus being repeated over 10 times. After almost a decade, this is the best songs they can put out? I'd pass on this E.P, not worth the time.
1,I bought this thinking it was an 80's song.. it wasn't. It's ok.
