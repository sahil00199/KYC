0,Excellent movie.
0,I pre-ordered my season 2 special edition Walking Dead like any good fan would, it came 1 day after it was released. Packaged in 3 boxes and bubble wrap, it took a good long time to get into it, but once I did, I realized it was worth EVERY penny! The detail on the face, the paint, the gore! I was in zombie paradise! The screwdriver is removable and the blu-rays have their own case. It scared the crap out of my kids the second they saw it. That should keep them out of the blu-rays for a few years! The disks are riddled with a few easter eggs and a few great "documentary" shorts. Also commentary is available on a few episodes. Worth listening to if you are a big fan! Now I just have to wait til october for my Compendium 2, and season 3 to start!
0,This show is so funny
0,I love this movie and have seen it many times.  I am not necessarily a fan of war stories, but this is the exception.  It held my interest because it depicts the life of Patton and the politics that hindered his fighting WWII..  He was bold and eccentric; demanded respect which he deserved and received.  I recommend this movie for all who enjoy biographies.
0,As I am lazy and my sentiments are pretty much the same as when I reviewed the first two boxsets, I pretty much c/p'd those reviews and just added necessary changes.		If you love the Fullmetal Alchemist anime, this is a great box set to get. This box set comes with DVDs 8-10 of the series as well as booklets/inserts for each DVD. Each booklet contains beautiful artwork from the show, character profiles, and comments from production staff. The main box and the boxes that hold the discs and inserts are really well done; they keep everything safe and have great artwork.		I noticed the product description didn't have a rating. I, personally, wouldn't recommend this for those under 13-14 years of age, but those commenting on my previous reviews felt that ages 10-12 would be alright with it. Things get violent and there are several adult topics prevalent (war, murder, politics, racism). If you are unsure about it, just watch it before you let the children do and make your own judgment call.
0,I remember now watching this series on cable and liking it then.	  Most all the episodes are very interesting and of course being Bluray really enhances the experience.	  How accurate is the scientific information being given- being spoon fed for the general public but still informative.	  For budding geologist's it is a good entry point. It gets your interest and if you want to explore further i am sure there are books or scientifically deeper video's to watch.	  You are getting over 10 hours of entertainment for a very good price- if it stays this low .
0,Good cast and good stories. What more could a person want?
0,Brings back alot of memories. Kids love the series. Good for younger kids. Great outdoors movies. Teaches to be kind to nature.
0,Its a little bit comedy but more of an underdog story.  Ive never watched any of his shows before, but Carolla is a likeable character.  Overall a good movie.  Recommended.
0,A large scale film that just didn't hit the 'let's go see it' list. Good mix of drama, local color, some saucy but dated romantic scenes, plenty of action (plenty of nice vintage WWII armor), backstabbing, shoot 'em ups and Ernest Borgnine as 'Fat Cat' is extra special. Worth watching.
0,Another life saver!
0,This is a great coming of age movie that has interesting perspecive and we used it as learning life lessons for our two young teenage daughters to hopefully strengthen their integrity and deepen their motivation to stay close to God and not jump into this crazy world's ways.
0,Not the best superhero movie but easily in my top 5. Great fun and great characters. Didn't care for the bad guy, but this movie was better than that failing. Nowhere near as good as Winter Soldier, but about as good as Avengers: Age of Ultron.
0,This an excellent DVD for the money, very informative and an excellent "hand in hand" for the book "Scaling Force".		The often-neglected subject of this DVD  is assessing and dealing with the realities of the different levels of violent situations we may encounter in the real world. The authors have put together much of the essential information found in the book, edited down of course, in an easily accessible format.  This they do by dealing with the issue at the different levels at which the viewer may encounter them (and different levels of response), from when someone sees the potential for a fight, through the onset of a fight, to the reality of finding yourself in a fight. This is done mostly in a mix of  classroom and workshop style walk-throughs. Hands-on examples of the key technical points they are teaching are shown.		This tutorial does not stop there, but attempts to rationally cover the factors one should consider (social, moral, and legal) when making the decision to defend yourself. Violent action in any civilized part of the world does not begin with the first blow nor end with the last one - and this DVD touches on the details leading up to, during, and continuing into the aftermath, of a violent encounter. Awareness, common sense, and rationalizing/mastering ones natural reactions when under stress are discussed and principals applied with an eye to real life practicality. This DVD is not about how to throw a punch - it is also about when, and even if, to throw a punch.		Obviously, I am very impressed with this tutorial, as I was with the book. If I presumed to re-title this DVD for the authors, I might call it "WHERE THE DOJO USUALLY LEAVES OFF", as few of the many gyms and dojos that I have trained at or visited over the last forty years went into any real depth on what is contained in this DVD.		Both the DVD and the book are worth having for anyone who wants to be safer on the street.	I recommend getting them both.
0,Just great season. But im only on 2nd episode. Here, when MacGerrett recruit Carew he almost pronounce Danno! But almost...	The 2nd episode was powerful with a lady whois husband died, also becoming part of the force.	I will miss Danno and Ho Kelly but still, Steve or Jack plays well until the last powerful episode. It's just to finish well the season that marks  the series as a whole, and without it it won't do.		Worth to buy! I give it 4 plus stars
0,I will never understand why TV networks cancel the best shows and keeps junk on the air. Along with Jericho, this is one of the best TV series I've ever watched and am sorry to see it fall. A mix of alien, suspense, sci/fi, romance and a great cast, you can't beat this show. I highly recommend it and plan to buy this DVD ASAP.
0,great movie
0,There are a lot of funny moments in this movie!
0,Excellent!
0,Micheal Douglas does it again! He is awesome
0,This is a great old fashioned heroic adventure story filmed with a lot of action, color and heart.  These characters are wonderful and alive.  The costumes, sets and battle scenes are great, especially since this was just a kind of TV movie.	I probably don't have to praise the actors to anybody who has read the cast list but here I go anyway.  Sean Bean is a great action star as the hero, Richard Sharpe, an officer who has come up through the ranks.  Asumpta Serna, as the Spanish guerilla leader and Sharpe's love interest, is beautiful and soulful.  Brian Cox, an actor seemingly incapable of anything other than perfection, gives another one of his flawless performances as Wellington's staff intelligence officer.  And high praise has to go to Daragh O'Malley as Sergeant Harper.	This is grand adventure indeed.
0,Henry (Macaulay Culkin) is a typical young boy. He spends his care-free hours playing, building crossbows to kill neighborhood pets, and causing major freeway accidents. He enjoys watching the results of his play. His mum and dad have been down in the dumps ever since Henry's little brother had his fatal "accident" in the tub. Unlike Henry, the folks just let it keep bothering them for some reason. Now, there's cousin Mark (Elijah Wood from The Ice Storm, Lord Of The Rings, and Sin City) to worry about. He's staying for a couple of weeks while his dad (David Morse from The Green Mile and Disturbia) is in Japan. At first, Henry thought that Mark might be fun, but he's a drag. He doesn't seem to enjoy Henry's games at all. Not even the chain-reaction car wreck game on the interstate! What a bore! If only Mark could get over his mother's recent demise. What is it with people and their "feelings" anyway? Henry just wants to have fun, and if Mark wants to be a big baby and a tattle-tale, then he just might have to have an "accident" of his own. What a shame. Oh well. THE GOOD SON is a terrific thriller from director Joseph Ruben (The Stepfather). Culkin and Wood are utterly believable in their roles. Culkin's portrayal of a budding serial killer is so good it's frightening! Why did this kid disappear?? Wood is great too as the boy who knows what's going on, but can't get anyone to believe him. TGS is wicked and perfectly perverse...
0,WWE	TLC 2014		Spoilers		1.[I-C TITLE LADDER MATCH]-LUKE HARPER VS DOLPH ZIGGLER-we kick off the night with an excellent match, one of the best of the night. This was for the I-C title in Dolphs town so the crowd was really into this one. There were great spots of course but these two had a great back and forth and violent match together. Dolph gets the win in a big crowd pleaser.		2.[TAG TITLES]THE MIZ & DAMIEN MIZDOW VS THE USOS-the second match is for the tag titles and once again the crowd is behind Mizdow since he is hilarious. The Miz is having none of it though taking on the Usos basically by himself. Good match that ends with The Usos winning by DQ after Miz hits them with his slammy. Over all this was a good match that further put Mizdow over just on crowd reaction alone.		3.[STAIRS MATCH]BIG SHOW VS ERICK ROWAN-this match was much better than I was expecting it to be when first announced. Both men come out strong brawling all over the place. The stairs are used outside and inside of the ring. This one was basically a fight and nothing more, which is what it should have been. In the end the Big Show gets the win in a hard fought battle.		4.[TABLES MATCH]SETH ROLLINS VS JOHN CENA-this was a great match right here even though there are some that disagree with me. I thought the battle these guys went through was excellent. Fighting all over the place and tables getting crushed and Rollins getting all kinds of help like a classic heel. This was also the match that saw the return of Roman Reigns, who helped Cena win the match.		5.[DIVAS TITLE]NIKKI BELLA VS AJ LEE-a longer and better match than the last time these two hooked up on PPV. Good match between the two that sees the Bella retaining after having her sisters help during this match.		6.[CHAIRS MATCH]RYBACK VS KANE-this was your typical battle of the big men but once again I think it was better than some people say. The chairs came into play early and throughout the match but they weren't used as much as I thought they would be. Good match with Ryback coming out on top even after taking a massive chair to the face.		7.[US TITLE]RUSEV VS JACK SWAGGER-another good match but it was pretty much like their other matches. Swagger seemed like he was doing well until Rusev unleashed with them power moves and submission holds. Good match over all with Rusev retaining the strap.		8.[TLC MATCH]BRAY WYATT VS DEAN AMBROSE-best match on the card with two of the best wrestlers the company has. I loved this feud from the Shield/Wyatt matches to these guys one on one. These two always go hard and this match may have been the hardest they have been a part of. Dean starts strong controlling the first half of the match but when Bray takes control he takes control. After that they trade momentum using everything they can get their hands on. From tables, ladders, chair, kendo sticks and even TVs. In fact it is that last one that leads to the victory for Bray. This was an excellent match that would see Dean go off of three ladders onto Bray who himself was on a table. Excellent match.		BONUS		1. GOLDUST & STARDUST VS KOFI KINGSTON & BIG E-Kofi and E were representing their new faction The New Day with Xavier Woods. Now all three guys are great, especially Kofi, but this new gimmick doesnt seem to be getting over. I love these guys as a group but I think the fans reaction [or lack thereof] could lead them into a cool heel run. Any way this is a good tag match with both teams looking good. Gold and Stardust are probably my favorite team in the WWE so it was great to see them in action. Goldust has always been a favorite of mine and Cody as really came into his own as Stardust, which I assume was hard since it is based after his brothers character. This was a really good match with The New Day coming out on top, great effort from both teams.		You also get some interviews with Dolph Ziggler and the Bella Twins. This was a really good event that had some great matches on it. I enjoyed all of them from top to bottom and back. I would recommend this to any wrestling fan out there. All of the matches here were great and fun.
0,This one last big Musical from Hollywood looks fantastic on Blu-Ray. Sound and picture are in my opinion great.		Topol is just fantastic in is role als Milkman Tevey.		The movie starts automatically, its CODEFREE and contains a german soundtrack!!!!		The bonus-features are interesting, sadly not subtitled (german) - the only minus point I have.
0,I saw this on an overseas flight coming from Europe, and I was so happy as I would have never heard of it otherwise!		As someone who surfed in the late 70s/early 80s, guys like Mark Richards, Shaun Tomson and Wayne "Rabbit" Bartholomew and crew were our heroes.  I was especially a huge fan of Richards, and even had his iconic "MR" superman logo on the bottom of my board.  They are and remain legends today, and this movie provided not only a greater insight into the development of pro surf; but also showed where these wave-riding gods are today.		I could hardly wait to get home to buy a copy of this movie, as it is definitely one that every surfer of that generation will want.  I have a copy of "Step Into the Liquid" which is a great surf flick; but "Bustin' Down the Door" is old school surfing and a documentary I can better relate to.  These guys still look good nearly 30 years down the road, and their story needed to be told.  Thank you Jeremy Gosch for doing so!		By the way, not a spoiler but at the end of the movie where they transform the guys surfing today into them surfing back in "the day" was a pure cinematic masterpiece!
0,The story is well written and this is one of the best-produced L.D.S. history-based movies in every aspect that has been produced by anyone! The blu-ray is the best photography I've seen on any movie yet and I'm an aspiring photographer! Over and over throughout the movie I just kept saying "this is the kind of quality I've been hoping someone would produce and finally has; superb cinematography, color, sharpness, screenplay, storyline, and the acting is pretty darn good too." Few movies produced today (including l.d.s. movies) have a truly positive, life-changing affect on their viewers--but this one brought me closer to Joseph and Emma, and helped me understand and appreciate them in very motivating ways; I want to be worthy to associate with good people like them in the eternities so I had better take more care and work harder to stay on track in this life--if you know what I mean! My faith and hope were strengthened through this movie! Emma was a spiritual giant just like Joseph and this movie helps you to understand that. I would like to show this to every young woman in the church because I think Emma, in this movie, is such a positive role model for women and young women. So glad I bought the blu-ray version because on my blu-ray player and HD TV this film is what I would call "full of eye candy" it is so gorgeous and well-produced and filmed. After just the first viewing, it's one of my favorite movies! This kind of uplifting and inspiring entertainment is what people need to be watching and being inspired by today! I went out and bought "Praise To the Man" also, and I now want to get the other movies produced by T.C. Christensen as well! Treat yourself and your family to some faith-promoting, quality entertainment! I'm so glad that I did!
0,This show is sheer genius! Heartbroken it was cancelled due to low viewership. This is because STARZ channel is viewed as a bush-league channel. No one has ever heard of Starz. I fear some may have been prejudiced against Kelsey Grammar thinking he can't do anything but Frasier? Kelsey is a super star, extremely talented actor who could do ANY script thrown at him! This show rocks hard. Once you hear Mayor Tom Kane (Kelsey Grammar) spout off "When Truman Nuked Japan, When Lincoln sent boys to kill their cousins. Do you think they were worried about their approval rating? I think not! You tell me now another mayor in this country that takes better care of it's citizens than me? I don't think you can! -- Mayor Tom Kane, Mayor of Chicago. Yes it rocks hard - Buy it and watch a marathon of 2 seasons and you will be writing letters to HBO and ShowTime begging them to pick this show up!
0,Jeff never fails to make me laugh.
0,I enjoyed it!
0,Frost is an old-time British chief detective working with a team of younger detectives in a gritty fictional town in Great Britain.  He is independent and feisty, in a perpetual state of humorous disagreement with his bureaucratic superintendent.  His entire life centers on being "a decent copper" and he is, at the cost of difficult personal relationships outside of the job.  The series ran for 18 years, a testimony to the skillful balance of humor, smart detective work, solid characters, and good writing throughout the series.  We have seen every episode, and enjoyed every one.  We were sorry to reach the end of the series on Amazon.
0,great movie great cast
0,Mix the characters and themes from Bruce Willis in&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Die-Hard/dp/B000SZK41M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Die Hard</a>&nbsp;with Liam Neeson in&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Taken/dp/B002BI6SMI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Taken</a>, they'd become Costner's character and theme in 3 Days to Kill.		Overall, this movie provided exactly what I had hoped for: an action movie from Costner.  Call me a sucker, but I do not feel he is as washed up as many seem to think.  He still is a good actor who usually takes good roles.		The movie provided just enough ups and downs, lefts and rights and one decent twist to make an action movie something more than shooting, stabbing and elevator "accidents".  The plot had substance.  In fact, it had enough substance that practically any military member in the past decade could relate to Costner's character when it came to his family.  Sometimes the separation are necessary even though it is hardly "convenient" for anybody.  Because of that edge I gave the movie a fifth star instead of four I thought it deserved.		3 Days to Kill was worth watching.  When everything is broken down, that's the whole point of a good movie.
0,A Christmas gift for my husband.  He is a sports car racing fan.  Formula One is on his list of cars to watch.
0,Id never heard of the 1874 novel or its author, Thomas Hardy, until I saw the preview for this.  After reading the story synopsis and some reviews, I thought itd be worth seeing the movie, and I enjoyed it.  It takes place in Dorsetshire, and the cinematography is very beautiful.  Taking this film on its own merits (I cant compare it to other filmed versions or the book which Ive never read), I found it an uplifting experience, rooted in the moral character named Gabriel Oak, whos played with strong and quiet virtue by Matthias Schoenaerts, a Belgian actor.  Leonard Maltins online review of the movie says This movie offers him another great showcase and presents him as a world-class leading man.  Actress Carey Mulligan enhances the quality of the movie by giving some human depth to the fanciful and foolish woman, whose name is Bathsheba (the name reveals that shes an untrustworthy character before you even begin the story!).  The casting, acting, and directing were skillfully done in this film production, adding realism that I could emotionally invest in.  As a lover of folk music, I enjoyed the parts where the workers of Bathshebas estate have dances and songs.		Even all those components wouldnt have made me stay interested, though, if Schoenaerts hadnt played Gabriel Oak with such dignity and moral discernment.  His very presence keeps me oriented to the story much like Hugh Jackmans portrayal of Jean Valjean in the 2012 Les Miserables film.  Gabriel Oak is a shepherd who now has to work for Bathsheba after his sheep panic and run off a cliff in a storm.  He likes and is attracted to Bathsheba, but faces the reality that shes not willing to marry him, and he moves on emotionally.  Later, he shows strength of character by rebuking her and giving her wise advice, even though she promptly fires him afterward (which he probably expected).  When she wants him back to resolve a crisis, he comes back to work for her only after she shows some humility toward him.  He reminded me very much of the Bibles account of Jesus, in that he was extending friendship to her and giving her moral advice, but also backing away from her when she didn't want it, yet always willing to forgive her when she messed up her life and was repentant, though he would not be bound emotionally by her if she didn't want it.		Her folly is sometimes maddening to watch (the titles word madding means frenzied, whereas maddening means very frustrating).  This is because of the story, not the actress.  She glibly rejects the idea of marriage to Gabriel and to a nice gentleman named Boldwood because she feels itd make her just property, but then falls for the flattery of a man named Troy who just wants her for her physical beauty.  The wrangling of the characters, vying for her affection, is generally civilized throughout the movie (there is a gunshot, though), but though it got a little boring for me, I kept paying attention to how Schoenaerts would portray Gabriel Oaks reaction to the goings-on, and I remained very interested.  The beautiful cinematography was also wonderful.  The movie 12 Years a Slave (2013) had a very similar way of making the countryside look lush and semi-artificial, but also sort of realistic.		The take-home value for me with this film is the grace (unmerited favor) extended by Gabriel Oak to Bathsheba, which finally pays off.  I like it when stories like this or Puss in Boots (Puss initiates good actions for his master out of kindness) speak to a greater spiritual truth about God and nature.  It also helps when movies have equal attention to artistry and realism, which this one does.  Instead of sounding like they're reciting lines, it sounds like they're having real conversations.  A lot of period movies feel kind of fake, and this one feels more realistic, at least to me.  Therefore, Id recommend this movie for the excellent acting, cinematography, and the moral value of seeing how Gabriel Oak (played by Matthias Schoenaerts) handles situations with the unwise character of Bathsheba.  I became more emotionally invested in the movie than I expected to, and also got more out of it!
0,Yes those were the days...		 There will never be another show like All In The Family. This proved that the 'sitcom' could be used for political and social commentary. The best episode by far is "Archie Is Branded" the episode ends in a way you would never expect epecially for a comedy. Archie the Conservatist working-class man and his Liberal unemployed college student son-in-law Mike were always at it and the brilliance of the writing was in that they both had good sides to the arguments. This show never flinched from anything: racism, bigotry, violence, rape, murder all these and more are discussed in the third season. This series stands alone among others for it's ability to discuss politics and be funny about it at the same time. Compared to shows that came out in the next decade such as "The Cosby Show", this series is well worth watching.
0,"BILB" was a hit in Asia when it was released here last year, and it is good to know that this small movie has done well on both sides of the Atlantic. It boasts a good story, script, casting and direction and well deserves its boxoffice success. I think Roger Ebert's 3-1/2 stars review of the film also helps draw in the movie crowd. This is a refreshing movie because it provides a rare and colorful insight into the life of a Punjabi-British middle-class family living in the tight-knit Sikh community in London. The story is not just about a teenage girl (Jess) who has an obsession for playing football (or "soccer" as it is known in the US) but is also about the clash between the older and the younger generations that exists in every community and culture. After watching the movie, one realizes that teenagers are basically the same everywhere in the world, whatever their background or culture!		To me, the most enjoyable parts of the movie are the humour, Jess's fascination with football (and trying not to get caught by her parents for sneaking out to play the game) and the lavish Punjabi wedding scene. The last offers the viewer the chance to "experience" the beauty and tradition of another culture through the traditional wedding ceremony of Jess's sister. If in the movie, "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" you get a Greek wedding, in "Deer Hunter" a Russo-Catholic wedding and in "The Godfather" an Italian wedding, well, watch "BILB" for an unforgetable Punjabi wedding complete with scenes of the hectic (and oftentimes hilarious) preparations, the elaborate ceremony itself and the marvelous songs, dance and merry-making.		Parminder Nagra's portrayal of "Jess" is brilliant. You will laugh at the hilarious scene which takes place in the kitchen where Jess's mother is teaching Jess to cook. Behind her mother's back, Jess starts to bounce a round of cabbage on her knees (football-fashion) until she is "caught" by her mother and promptly dragged by the ears back to the stove to continue her cooking lesson. Another funny scene is when Jess's mother (after realizing the futility of trying to curb her daughter's interest in football and make her focus instead on homely duties and proper feminine behavior) throws up her hands in despair and tells her husband: "At least I taught her full Punjabi dinner. The rest is up to God."		There are also scenes to make the tears well up in your eyes: when a tearful Jess is forced to "hang up" her football boots for good after her parents absolutely forbid her to play, and when Jess's best male buddy attempts to make a "great sacrifice" by asking Jess's parents for permission to marry her on the chance that her parents would THEN allow her to go to the U.S. to play football (confused? watch the movie for details!). Also the sad scene where Jess's father bitterly recounts the discrimination he faced as a young immigrant in Britain.		Whatever you do, don't miss this meaningful and highly entertaining movie!		Trivia: After her impressive performance in "BILB", Parminder Nagra has been offered a permanent spot in a future season of the TV series, "ER". She is to play a medical intern (in a role specially written for her). Kiera Knightly (who plays Jess's bestfriend, Juliette) also went on from "BILB" to land the plum role of "Lara" in ITV's 2002 adaptation of "Doctor Zhivago".
0,Love this movie.  It's as good as the first which is rare.

0,Louis Nowra, one of Australia's greatest playwrights, wrote the screenplay that made this film what it is, namely, a landmark Australian film!		"Black and White" is a compelling story based on a 1959 trial that irrevocably changed police procedure and judicial authority in South Australia.		It is Christmas 1958 in conservative Adelaide, a city that prides itself on its peaceful, well-bred qualities. An excitable young lawyer, David O'Sullivan, is given the news that he has drawn a 'bad lottery prize'- a legal aid case. He must defend a young Aboriginal man Max Stuart who has been arrested for the rape and murder of a nine year old girl in the far west desert town of Ceduna. O'Sullivan soon concludes that the aborigine has been framed by the local police and decides he must take a stand. He finds himself pitted against Chamberlain, South Australia's Crown Prosecutor, a forbidding but tremendously charismatic character. O'Sullivan and his legal partner, Helen Devaney, embark on a 'David and Goliath' battle that threatens the world of closed ranks, hidden evidence and the establishment.		"Black and White" is a wonderfully compelling story of right and wrong! I loved it!
0,Very good movie.
0,Love all movies with Tyler Perry's and glad I did get this and would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to get it.
0,Well done film...well acted..vefry violent..true to the character portrayed!
0,Age of Ultron is often looked down on as a "weaker" MCU movie but I enjoyed it, I think Joss Whedon did a great job with it and it showcased more of one of the greatest Avengers of all, Hawkeye, and showed you why he is as important to the team as he is even through he originally was basically a knockoff of Green Arrow from DC.
0,It's actually a funny movie. I really enjoyed it.
0,From the pilot to the current season, the characters are well written and have depth.  The premise of each show is actually believable.  I hope they keep the same writers and not go into a weird tangent like so many series do.
0,I didn't think I would like this but once I got in to it, it was really good.  Robin Williams has played several less than savory characters in the past and his part in August Rush was borderline.  Overall, the movie was very enjoyable.
0,Great classic movie, Arrived fast and in perfect shape. Glad I got to share it with my son for Christmas. He loved it.
0,I watch this movie like it was an annual pilgrimage. Each year when its close to the holidays - out comes Airport on dvd to play on my tv. I know everything that's going to happen.....but I don't care. I buy copies for presents and people look at me strangely but then come back and tell me it was a great movie that they've never heard of and glad they got it from me. Its sort of a national unknown treasure. Glad they went into full production of it as the vhs tape I had, well, let's just say I was getting worried. The absolute best part of this show was the introduction of the split screen to bi-screen and tri-screen. So many great one-liners. It shows how they used to get on board the airplanes before TSA and how you could meet people arriving at the gate. Its a time capsule that spans generations. Reminds me a bit of the short series Pan Am that lasted 1 season.
0,I am hoping they come out with the rest of the series in DVD. This series brings me back to the past. The actors made you believe they are a real family dealing with every day occurances.
0,I bought this for a granddaughter and she loved it.  It was in very good condition
0,goo0d show
0,Love this movie, got this on Fire TV. Works great.
0,Great flick the whe family can watch. I highly recommend it.
0,While my political leanings don't match with Dave - I always enjoy watching this to show how good ole "good guy" overcomes the "bad guys" in politics.
0,LOVED THIS MOVIE WITH ALL MY HEART! Great, wonderful fun and based on a true story! Matt Damon and a zoo.... Who wouldn't love that combo!  Buy it and you'll love it too!
0,Hilarious.
0,Excellent product
0,great film.
0,Suspense, Action, Romance, Comedy -- this movie is a delight! Vincent Price is so much fun to watch; Robert Mitchum is capable and cool under stress; and Jane Russell is front and center in the story: beautiful, a great personality, and she sings! Besides the main plot are many smaller elements, such as when Mitchum's character comes to the aid of a newlywed couple with a gambling problem. The climax begins to play out with Mitchum on the boat in the center of the action, while Price in comic style gathers his rag-tag militia. A rare mix of suspense and humor. Raymond Burr is a heavy heavy. The romantic interplay of Mitchum and Russell ties it all together.
0,Good tour of the 7 churches by Joe Stowell
0,Saw this on TCM and had to add to my collection.	This DVD made on demand is an excellent copy. The movie itself is about the singing Canadian mounted policeman. It's basically the movie that are cartoons Dudley do Right is based on! A classic love story with a great well known song in the middle. I'm not going to spoil it for you. I must see. I think even teenage girls will enjoy it.
0,I was a little hesitant to see this movie, it seemed like one of the all too recent movies where all of the good parts are featured in the trailer, and that's all you've got.  So not the case.  Not only was it a packed theatre at the midnight showing, but there was not any interval longer than three minutes that had a quiet audience.  Nobody could stop laughing!	From Zach Galifiakanis, we had a stellar show.  His ability to play the creepy weirdo is out of this world.  His wolf pack speech was amazing.	The cameo from Mike Tyson was hilarious!	Don't miss the end credits where a lot of the missing information is revealed.
0,This is, of course, a chic flick. I love English productions. Not every movie has to have women with plastic breasts.	Loved the setting. Makes you want to take the next flight to Italy.
0,So damn bad that is AFUCKENMAZING
0,Simone Signoret will break your heart!  She deservedly won an Oscar for one of the all time great performances ever given by any actress.  She is simply devastating.  Matched all the way by Laurence Harvey, alternately  cruel and callous and then warm and tender.  Their scenes together ring  true and are timeless depictions of deep emotional and sexual intimacy.  The other themes of the film, class distinctions etc. are still valid...but  it will be Simone, touching the heart of this callow young man and making  him better for it, feeling their age difference yet unable to stop herself  from loving and hoping for happiness against her own experience, that will  haunt you. A shattering film masterpiece.
0,Super Hero Squad Show is my Fav cartoon of all time. The humur is pointed toward older generation. Dont recommend younger kids but if you want a good laugh give it a try.
0,I always loved Raymond. Very classy show. Wish more were like it on TV these days.
0,Character development at its best. At first  I was reluctant, not wanting even to watch episode one, season one, of this series. In spite of my reluctance, the name of the series kept on popping up in random conversations with my friends, and Netflix continued to suggest it based on my interests. I finally gave it a shot and was extremely satisfied with not only the quality of the acting, of the film (filmed in 35 mm film), but also on the strength of the story itself.		Walter White, the protagonist of the series, is a high school, genius chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with Stage IIIA lung cancer. After being told that the cancer was inoperable, and sneaking a peek into his bank account, he realizes his financial situation isn't healthy at all, worse off when he is offered medical treatment costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. S*** truly hit the fan for Mr. White. With less than a year to solve his financial crisis and having to pay a bucket load of cash for his treatment, Walter White recurs to a less reputable business to ensure his family's financial situation before he lays down on his deathbed. His brother-in-law, a DEA agent, spoils hims by saying a meth-cook may make up to seven hundred grand in less than a couple of batches of methamphetamine. Being a chemistry genius, he has no problem in conjuring the most perfect, purest recipe for cooking meth. He wouldn't imagine hell would break loose while dealing with the maniacs in this dark business. He thought he would be staying within the confinement of his RV meth-lab and living his normal parallel life.		At the beginning the purpose of the series was for Walter to justify the "righteous" act of providing for his family's future when it meant going to the dark-side of money-making by not selling, but actually making the drugs: cooking meth (a.k.a crystal meth, ice, clouds, crystal, glass, tik, catch my drift?). It felt wrong but somehow, the fact that he was desperately struggling to keep his family from falling into the brink made the illicit act seem righteous.		Molecular visuals of METH.	Did you know that meth has a medical use? It's used for ADHD, narcolepsy, and treatment-resistant depression.		After many attempts to sell what was renown as the purest meth out there, "the blue stuff", Walter and Jesse (his partner, a former high school student who is known to be a mediocre meth-cook) found trench after trench, failing at their attempts to make money by selling their product, which albeit highly addictive, always seemed to fall into the wrong hands. Fail after epic-fail, they found themselves delving into the dark-world of selling drugs, not at all expecting it to be such a treacherous path. They then recur to an alternate source of selling their genius-formula by contacting a fearless and very well respected business man and drug lord, a strategy they would eventually regret.		For me the series has been very enjoyable, with more than just a great story-line and more than just action-and-adventure psychological excitement. Character development was the biggest takeaway for me from this series: How a man in search of a path, once thought righteous and bittersweet, found that he, in the contrary of rejecting the darkest parts of himself as he deepened into the dark-side, embraced them--the bitter portions of darkness gone after a prolonged dose of positive reinforcement upon earning heaps of cash by selling batch after batch of meth. How the character devolves was supremely achieved by the actor, Brian Cranston, winning him the Prime Time Emmy Award for three consecutive years in 2008, 2009, and 2010.		In parallel with Walter's charter development, I also admire Jesse Pinkman's (Aaron Paul) devolution into a darker creature, more menacing, less tolerant and much less merciful. If he started out as a meth-head, he slowly turned into an character of many layers, of half-patched hidden depths. After having suffered beatings, the death of his true-love, and warming up to the idea of shooting people in the face, Pinkman becomes a man to fear, a man who has seen too much and is willing to die even if it means to defend what little is left of the world he loves.		At the beginning of each episode, I was a little bothered by knowing I would have to watch so many more episodes that were fifty minutes long each, but hell, the production and quality of each one is so good that once you start watching it, you're lured into its mind-gripping world; you can't just shake it off. You'll end up watching the whole series in a matter of weeks.		Season 5 is said to bring us a total of 16 episodes, divided in two parts. The first part was debuted last year, and the second part will be premiered in August 2013. It will surely be a blast as Mr. White's, Jesse's, Skyler's and Hank's future is wagered by the odds.		DISCUSSION:		I've asked myself many times these two questions in the midst of each episode:		Could a series like this one actually increase the production of the drug "meth" by amateurs in their own "RV super lab"? Or could it, in the contrary, decrease the amateur production and consumption of the drug after seeing what effects it has on peoples' lives and the appalling consequences it could have to their families?
0,Like the series but personal relationships were not really explained.  In one season they're a couple, next not....no explanation.
0,My husband and i enjoyed watching summer slam.amazon ships quickly
0,One of the most beautiful movies.  The color is amazing
0,I have them all....Great series.
0,Very funny! Adult humor. Ms. Diaz was not given an opportunity to be funny, but made a great straight man. Ms. Mann was frickin' hilarious!
0,Great movie lots of action.
0,Great
0,good but dumb comedy
0,Pros-		Saruman and Gandalf scene at beginning was excellent and worth the price alone.		The Mouth of Sauron was interesting and I highly anticipated this scene, but, as said in the extras, it is impossible to duplicate the tension of the book in this scene because in the book you don't know what has happened to Frodo yet.		The earthquake of skulls in the Paths of the Dead was stunning (but possibly slightly over the top when they envelope the trio).		Surprisingly, no extra endings.		Cons -		It seems to me that some of the sequences of battle scenes were changed. The battle doesn't flow as well, especially at the end when it is drawn out so that Gothmog is fighting Eowyn and then Aragorn walks by and kills him. Somewhat anticlimactic for Eowyn to fight Gothmog after she killed the Witch King, but I am nitpicking.
0,Young lovers under a devastating evil spell.  A kindly old priest.  And a young pickpocket:  Matthew Broderick, who brings comic relief and some of his best work in film!  He is an inventive scallywag, playful, caring, loyal, and necessary to the story... a joy to watch.  And, of course, there's the evil bishop.  This story takes place in medieval times, the days of knights -  and days and nights play a major part in the tale.  Michelle Pfeiffer never looked more stunningly beautiful and the tall, handsome Rutger Hauer plays her knight in shining armor.  Leo McKern is wonderul as the guilt-ridden old priest.  If you haven't seen this film, you have missed a great story.  And "eye candy" doesn't get any better than Rutger Hauer and Michelle Pfeiffer in this movie!
0,Proper
0,I missed all of the theatrical presentations of all of these movies. Why? Long (and somehow funny) story... But I've seen all of them now at their full extent, and still have 4 DVD's of extras to see. Magnificent work, magnificent pack!
0,This CD contains some of my favorite episodes of the show.	Some didn't like the commentary, but I think it adds some real insight into the genius of the guys who made this show...	enjoy...
0,Bought these when I started switching my DVDs to Blu-ray.  Much better than the old DVDs, and action scenes are smoother.
0,I watched this Movie on DVD in my Private home, and All I can say this is a truly moving movie and well worth watching more than once!		You will find a Caring Mother about her child and she will not rest until Justice is Proved.
0,Excellent movie. So very glad I purchased it. Still a very timely  review of what is going on in today's world.
0,The descriptions by some of the other reviewers of picture quality is understandable. My copies are only slightly problematic. Growing up in the pre cable and pre HD days this problem is less for me. I wonder what the master tapes looked like when they were transferred to DVD. There's little that can be done if the original source is flawed badly. I'm just grateful to have this collection, been waiting a long time.		I think 'All In The Family' is the best and most influential sit com ever. Norman Lear was a genius when he borrowed this show from the Brits. The cast is top notch. The show touched on a wide variety of topics which had not been handled in this way previously. Racism/race relations, sexuality and questioning the patriarchy were topics which were a hot topic then as they are now. The more things change the more they stay the same? Could this show be broadcast in today's PC culture? I doubt it. Thankfully we can see this series uncut in all it's non PC splendor. Brilliant cast, writing and production that stands the test of time. Very highly recommended.
0,Great movie!!
0,I love this movie. It reminds me of another.  The cast were great; always some of my favorite actors to watch.
0,If you haven't seen this movie -- rent it -- you'll be glad you did.  Inspiring.
0,Though each of the Alien films has its own merit and deserves a spot in the hall of fame of films, I would say that this one is definitely the best of the "Alien" series, as it combines the greed of the human corporate and military entitites, each seeking preservation for their own purpose, the callousness and delusion of some motivated by personal gain and profit, the horror and nastiness of the aliens, including a queen breeding an ever evolving type of aliens, and the high suspense of seeing a small group desperate to just get out of harm's way trying to make it out and get back home safe. Each passing second brings a new casualty and the renewed question of "how will they make it out"? The fun never ends in this one, and there's never a dull moment with a great combination of solid story and solid action.
0,I couldn't put the books down. A friend sent them to me. They aren't anything that I would have chosen on my own, I know nothing about and have never been even remotely interested in Botswana, but once I started reading, I couldn't stop! I had to have every single one of them and finished them at a rate of one per day.		If I had turned on this video or seen a promo for it on TV, I would have passed on it. It takes time to "warm up" to the personalities and their surroundings, even though the actors are superb!		I had bought the video thinking I wouldn't like the books and watching it would be better (and faster). I could then tell my friend who sent me the books that I had enjoyed the series, but not tell her that I didn't read them all. It didn't work out that way. I LOVED reading the books!		So far I've only watched the first episode on the video. The problem is, I had only read 3 or 4 of the books at the time I got the video, and most of the images on the screen were much different from what I had visualized in my head while I was reading. I wanted to get the books solidly in my head first before seeing an interpretation of it from someone else.		I did watch enough to know that some of video series was spot on and a few things were even better than I had "seen" in my mind. I stopped watching because I had ordered the rest of the series in book form and wanted to enjoy those before I "ruined" them by watching what someone else had visualized. Now I have given it a couple of weeks and I am ready to see another interpretation or version of these great books that I never thought I would want to read. Now I can get excited about the video, because ...there are no more books left for me to read until he writes a new one.  I'm still hesitant to spoil my own version, the one in my head, but I will do that today and will report back.
0,In this episode Q has been kicked out of the 'Q Continuum' and attempts to convince Captain Picard to allow him to join the crew.  Upon being rejected, Q 'throws' the Enterprise thousands of lightyears away where they  encounter the Borg.	This episode is a high-point of TNG's 2nd season.  Not only do we see a vendictive Q, but are introduced to one of the most  powerful races the Federation will have to fight.
0,My daughter absolutely LOVES Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, so I was happy to find this Disney Treasures DVD at a reasonable price.		Oswald is making something of a comeback with Disney, most noticeably in his newly established presence at Disneyland Park in Anaheim. Oswald merchandise is beginning to show up, and Oswald even has his own name-branded store in the new "Buena Vista Street" area of California Adventure, which just completed a major overhaul of its attractions and environs.		Most people don't know that Oswald was a Walt Disney creation that predated Mickey, that Walt lost the rights to Oswald and that the Disney Company recently reacquired the rights to this early Disney character. In fact, up until a year or so ago, few clerks manning the stores at Disneyland had ever heard of Oswald. That's changed.		Thus, the issue of this DVD set, which really belongs in every Disneyphiles collection.		Now, if only Disney would reissue the entire tin-boxed "Treasures" series on BluRay!		Recommended.
0,Darkly comic and quirky, this series is such great fun, you may want to dust off that metal detector and try your own luck at finding fortune underfoot. Of course it's tough to compete with Andy and Lance (MacKenzie Crook from Game of Thrones, Toby Jones from The Hunger Games). These lads are smart enough to know even junk can find a buyer on ebay, but they're looking for the bigger, better score--namely, the rumored existence of a Saxon-era windfall. All they need is time and patience, but life keeps getting in their way, not to mention all those matchbox cars! Sophie, (Aimee Fifion-Edwards) a newcomer to 'detecting' wants to help the pair, and adds her enthusiasm to their quest. I had no idea what to expect of this series, but between its sly pop cultural references, the bittersweet romantic tinges and the treasure hunting duo,  with LOL zingers out of nowhere, it's fresh and fun and sets viewers up to want more, more, more, because we need to know how it all turns out! Binge watch the entire half dozen episodes and check out the behind the scenes feature for more enlightenment. Truly a gem, and you don't need a metal detector to find it.
0,This show always has me on the edge. Buy this or die...because this show will rock your Canadian socks off
0,Cusack: It's my chance, I gotsta dance. Say the alphabet backwards with your eyes closed. Great and stupid, love this movie with Tim Robbins and Bing Crosby's daughter. Jello Biafra as an FBI agent. Best is the music. And at the end, two classics.
0,Well made
0,We really like Channing Tatum and this is a very good movie, we have watched it several time, we recommend it!
0,Nice!
0,It arrived on time and in great condition. It played well and enjoyed it.  Thank you.
0,I bought all of the seasons separately as they first came out, and I highly recommend watching the entire television series through to the end. While looking for the last piece of the series (see the end of the review), I came across some great deals (in terms of price), but was dismayed to see just how confusing things have become on Amazon. This review below is meant to help you wade through the mess in the marketplace, purchase the series, and enjoy it. I originally posted it for the combined Seasons 4.0 and 4.5 set, but someone kindly suggested I post it elsewhere as well. I hope you find it helpful.		DVD CONFUSION	-------------------------------------------------------	The show is incredible. However, the whole DVD thing has been a disaster. They released it in the worst way possible (see below), Amazon compounded the problem by lumping together reviews for DIFFERENT PRODUCTS, and the DVD manufacturers seem to be changing the contents of some products. I cannot imagine how someone who is not deeply familiar with it is supposed to purchase this wonderful show. Certainly, they would hesitate to give it as a gift! Let's hope this solves your problem.		In one sentence, I can say that here is what you want to get: Seasons 1, 2.0, 2.5, 3, 4.0, 4.5, and The Plan. I have links to them below. If you get these, then you will be sure to have it all.		========================================		-Season One was released as (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Battlestar-Galactica-Season-One/dp/B000AJJNFE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Battlestar Galactica  - Season One</a>) altogether with the pilot in one box.	-Season Two was released as&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Battlestar-Galactica-Season-2-0-Episodes-1-10/dp/B000BNI90Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Battlestar Galactica - Season 2.0 (Episodes 1-10)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Battlestar-Galactica-Season-2-5-Episodes-11-20/dp/B000GFLEAO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Battlestar Galactica: Season 2.5 (Episodes 11-20)</a>&nbsp;in two boxes.

Occasionally I come across things like "Battlestar Galactica: Season 4.5 - Limited Edition Gift Set (2009)." It seems like a lot of money for one part of the full season, but you get some dog tags with it, so if you are into collecting memorabilia, you might want to consider it.	-The Plan was released on its own as&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Battlestar-Galactica-The-Plan/dp/B002HRF68A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Battlestar Galactica: The Plan</a>		========================================		OPTIONS FOR PURCHASING THEM ALL TOGETHER: BAD TO GOOD	-------------------------------------------------------	-Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series (with COLLECTIBLE CYLON). Not recommended. I do not own this, but according to the reviews, it is packaged poorly WITHOUT AN EPISODE LIST. That seems like a horrible idea for four seasons of a tv show. Apparently, it contains the same DVDs as the ones sold separately (explained above).	-Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series (the one in the GRAY BOX). *Recommended*. I do not own this. Good reviews of it so far. Packaging problems were fixed. According to a comment from customer Leif Sheppard, it does include The Plan.	-Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series (with COLLECTIBLE CYLON) [BLU-RAY] or the gray box [BLU-RAY] set. *Recommended*. I do not own this. Seems to include some extras, but not significant. It also has an episode list, according to the reviews. It might be worth buying if you wanted to get everything together.		BOTTOM LINE:	-------------------------------------------------------	As far as I can tell from the reviews, I think there are two choices:	(1) Buy either one of the Blu-Ray sets or the Gray DVD set.	(2) Purchase everything separately (make sure to get all of the stuff mentioned above).		NOTE:	-------------------------------------------------------	-The "Face of the Enemy" webisodes (episodes shown only online) have not been made available for purchase in any of the sets as far as I can tell. What a shame!	-Also, if anyone sees any mistakes in this review, please tell me and I will edit it. Frustratingly, the manufacturers seem to be changing the contents of some sets, so it is possible that my information has become outdated.
0,this is an adorable movie, great for kids and adults!! i will watch this again and again, even though i'm in my twenties.
0,All warnings, pros and cons from previous season reviews apply to this season. Adult Content and not for children. The only episode that went overboard with the brutality/depravity toward women/children was Episode #4 & a star was removed for it. The rest of the season was very good, overall. Thought the dwarf "play" after the wedding was a bit too long and quite stupid but the after wedding party had a great ending. Episode #9, (the Wildling battle @the wall), was the best episode.		This season really didn't have major cliffhangers, so to speak, but there are several major surprises...especially with the Lannister story line.
0,and a very interesting story..based on history which is the kind of movie i like.	the actors are terrific also.
0,A good family movie. Mr. Clooney was the perfect choice for the part.
0,This is for the 4 disc 3D edition:		My shipment arrived yesterday (Saturday), before street date (thanks, Amazon!).		I have to admit that I wasn't really impressed with the 3D when I saw this in the theater, but I can honestly (and thankfully) say that it is MUCH better on my 3D TV than when I saw it in the theater.		The image quality is crystatl clear, and the 3D adds a wonderful depth that, again, I did not see in the theater. I wonder if the theater that I saw it in did not have the proper setup or equipment? In any event, I am thrilled that I got the 3D version of this movie. The restoration/cleanup is fantastic, and the sound is equally dazzling.		This set does come with 2 discs for the 3D version of the film. The 3rd disc is the regular 2D version (including audio commentaries), and the 4th disc contains all the bonus features. The bonus content includes 2 new documentaries, the first being "Reflections on Titanic", which includes new interviews with James Cameron, Kate Winslet, Bill Paxton, Kathy Bates and others. Leonardo DiCaprio is not featured in any of the new interviews but is seen in some of the older footage. The 2nd new documentary is "Titanic: The Final Word", which is a very interesting and informative re-examination of the sinking. Both of these documentaries run about 90 min or so each.		Also in the bonus materials are trailers, tv spots, music video (of course), 30 deleted scenes, 60 behind the scenes featurettes (none running over a couple of minutes), a few "Titanic" parodies, some footage shot by crew members (some is funny, some leaves you scratching your head), and some other archival features from the Special Edition DVD set from a few years back.		This is DEFINITELY worth the upgrade from the previous DVD releases!		EDIT: Also includes code for digital copy.
0,the best documentary
0,Magnificent dancing, with a touching story, which at times bordered on soap opera. If you love great dance, as I do, you will love it. It was good to see Patrick Swayze again.
0,It is still so funny and the characters are like old friends
0,the true story of Audie Murphy, war hero.
0,The omitted songs and scenes are annoying, as some of them are vital to the production, the players and the items that are left are very good, but I think it misses the intent of Gilbert's plot.  Jack point is a third-rate comic and a pathetic figure.  Unfortunately, Drake is a powerful singer and actor, and is not a particularly good fit as Point.  Celeste holm, however, is excellent.  It is enjoyable, but for the definitive version, see the Joel Grey production.
0,It's 1183. Henry II has summoned his wife and children to join him for the Christmas holiday. It's not for the joy of their company, for this family is unhappy in its own toxic way. This movie lays that toxicity bare, then sends these unhappy people back where they came from.		I love this movie. It's become my family's traditional Christmas movie (a tradition that my kids would probably jettison if they could, but if I have to watch The Aristocats every Saturday, they have to watch The Lion in Winter once a year). The dialogue, the acting, the scenery, it all comes together in one wonderful whole, which is odd because the parts really aren't all that wonderful.		The dialogue is relentlessly witty. A small amount of wit makes dialogue sparkle, but this movie is one brilliant one-liner after another. Even poor John (presented here as a much bigger dolt than the historical evidence justifies) gets off the occasional zinger. I enjoy the verbal torrent, but sometimes it makes me feel like I'm drowning in the words.		The actors seem to love their lines; they deliver them with relish. They chew on them, roll them around, wallow in them, declaim and shout and hiss them with shameless promiscuity. Overacting? Oh, yes. But this was a stage play before it was a movie, and it may be that the exaggerated emotion that's necessary on stage was carried into the film out of force of habit.		The setting and scenery are dreary, though there are some lovely shots at the beginning and end of the movie when Eleanor arrives and then leaves by water. The castle looks cold and uncomfortable - in a word, authentic. It's a place where a family can fall apart with bitter recriminations all around and not make the house any more unpleasant a home than it already is.		All that is beside the point, because the elements of this movie come together in a beautifully harmonious way. Through all the anger and bitterness we can see the embers of the love that bound Henry and Eleanor. Their sons are cold and cynical and manipulative, but we sense the regret, the love that might have been, if only the royal court weren't so cold and deadly a place. The story is sad, but it shines with humor and that endless torrent of wit. The acting is over the top, but the actors play characters who are grander and meaner than life, people whose lives are over the top.		Katharine Hepburn is radiant in this film; Peter O'Toole is magnificent. Nigel Terry is deliciously low as John, and Anthony Hopkins is a sadly damaged Richard. There was no one in this film I didn't like, either as a character or as an actor.		This isn't a film for people who want action or subtlety in their movies (thought it does have both). You have to enjoy a certain amount of chattiness, not mind scenes that don't actually lead anywhere. What you'll get in return is an ultimately optimistic view of life, which for all its pettiness and disappointments can always hold out the promise of something grand and wonderful.
0,A Full Moons Grindhouse release of Rino di Silvestros 1976, Le deportate della sezione speciale SS or SS Special Section Women (video title). As you might guess, this movie fits the overall sexploitation genre, yet it remains a relatively original (for the time) combination of WIP (Women in Prison) and nazi-sexploitation sub-genres. Please, take my words with caution; however, this is likely one of the most well achieved sexploitation entrances when it comes to the main characters and script. The story is simple, and where women in Nazi-occupied countries are packed onto a train and shipped off to a prison camp, where the sadistic commandant (starred by John Steiner) takes the very best and uses them as rewards for his lesbian guards and perverted and deviate troops. The twist here comes here with the commandant who gets obsessed (in love?) with one of the inmates (played by Lina Polito), something that causes his downfall. The movie still has some nasty scenes, a good dose of naked women, but overall it falls short in sex and gore, so be warned those who expect some more along these issues.		Technically, this is a full-screen enhanced for widescreen TVs DVD presentation. The movie is region free (0), offered with English audio, but no subtitles. Extras include a Grindhouse Featurette of interest to fans of these flicks. Contrary to what Amazon lists associated to this title, the movie runs for 91 (not 98) minutes approximately. Given that IMDB informs a total feature length of 98 minutes, I assume this is not the original totally uncut version. In fact, the 91 min length on this current version matches the version sold in Spain entitled as Las deportadas, so that is not an alternative to get a more complete version.
0,Why 4 stars?  I bought this for the secondary "short features" on the version that I ordered.  The film itself is probably used in school cinema courses as an example of a really bad film!

0,Are you tired of watching the same old TV show over and over and over again? Try watching Pee-wee's Playhouse because it is the best, the  greatest, and excellent TV show you've ever seen.
0,Jesus is our Protection. He is the Healer.
0,Loved the series when it first aired and was glad to see it available on Amazon
0,Wasn't sure I was going to like it based in first few minutes but once he flies off the story really begins.  It a good story about learning and changing your attitudes when times are hard.
0,You really should see this in your lifetime. Awesome. The Indian playing the flute was the "topper". Great experience. Put it on your "Bucket List"
0,Scruffy sniveling weakling two-bit criminal Alex (a perfectly wimpy Bill Osco, who also co-produced the film) and his equally foul, more hard-nosed no-count vicious partner Ray (a marvelously mean portrayal by Jason Williams of "Flesh Gordon" infamy) are a couple of pathetic low-life hoodlums who wind up killing four cops when a coke deal for $100,000 bucks goes completely awry. Man, does this baby have all the right tasty ingredients to qualify as a hugely enjoyable piece of vintage funky 70's drive-in exploitation junk: bluntly efficient direction by Walter R. Cichy (who also wrote the terse, concise script), a steady pace, raw, gritty, unpolished cinematography by Howard Ziehm, exciting occasional outbursts of gory action (none other than future Oscar winner Rick Baker did the bloody make-up f/x), a sappy folkie theme song, coarse, profane, priceless dialogue (sample line: "Why don't you snort a little dope; maybe it'll calm you down"), a little cheesy soft-core sex, a hard, no-nonsense and downright sadistic harsh tone, a spare, moody score by Hal Yoergler, a stirring last reel car chase, engagingly scrappy acting from a game no-name cast (James Nite in particular contributes a hysterical performance as a hapless ice cream man), a beautifully bleak bummer ending, and even a handy helping of rape, gratuitous nudity and degradation. An unjustly neglected gnarly little trash movie nugget.
0,CREEPY!

0,This movie presents the painful reality of divorce through the experience of a little girl, Maisie.  She does not understand what is going on in the world of the adults; however, she know very well who loves and cares for her and who does not.

0,Great series, although I'm not a fan of the new sergeant.
0,good movie with a different twist . Rusell Crowe  is excellent
0,Awesome, loved it, it was great, I hate writing these.  It's just great, why do I need a minimum of a certain amount of words.
0,I am so happy to have finally bought these. I was eyeing this item for a while. These are my favorite. Wish it would have been a set with all 5 movies but hey 3 out of 5 is good. Now i just have to get the other two to have my completed collection. Totally worth the low price point.
0,I have been enjoying this CD for some time. I am happy to say it is still working well and helping me have fun when I work out. I just wish I had more time to use the CD than I do. I think if you have time exercising with Richard Simmons is the way to go because his work out isn't boring.
0,Excellent flick~love Fench films...was not boring, rather clever plot.  The two leads well matched and professional.  The area of France where this is set is also beautiful.  Visually moving as a whole, this film.
0,Thank you, Rick
0,How anyone in the band is still alive after just this one tour is amazing!!!!

0,The late 1940's through the early 1950's, imo, were the very best years for cinema. Before the demise of the big screen, the distilling influence of t.v., the necessity for big budgets -  the mandatory interference with the art by folks who really do not belong in the creative process - casting directors, tyrannical studio v.p.'s, credit-jumpers, tabloid paparazzi, the right wing politicizing of lew wasserman and the hollywood blacklisters - particularly in small countries like Sweeden and Japan - one could still create art on the screen in a simple, unvarnished, moving way.  Like Kurusawa's magnificent Ikiru filmed around the same time, Summer With Monika is simply one of Bergman's best, and upon many years of reflection, more memorable for me than Persona, Skammen, or other more highly touted, more complex Bergman masterpieces.	Though not without idiosyncracies and flaws, the film maybe Bergman's definitive investigation of a question that haunts many of his later undertakings - what is at the root of (god forbid me for saying it) the feminine mystique?  Bergman's answer: In the words of no less an expert on the eternal misery of women than Dr. Laura Schlessinger (sans her deplorable politics): "... low or no self-esteem".		The idyllic utterly illusory edenic summer romance played out in in the last vestiges of an innocence which cannot live in the workaday world, brilliantly, by the gorgeous Lars Ekborg (Harry) and Harriet Andersson (Monika - was there ever a more sensually provocative heroine filmed on screen - and note: entirely without makeup, hollywood diet/workout routine, or skin shop quick fix-it?) is as graphic a peek at Eve's primal first bite as we will ever have in post-modern consciousness.	What Arthur Miller (also around this time) termed 'the tragedy of the common man', of epic porportion and real, filmed on a shoestring budget, von de seele.
0,A great musical and comedy. A great "pick you up" movie! Highly recommended!
0,This gripping biography of one of the greatest generals in Wolrd War II grabs your attention from the opening pre-credits speech until the end of the film. George C. Scott gives his greatest performance, and is backed by Karl Malden (best known to TV audiences as starring in "The Streets Of San Francisco"). Despite a number of historical errors (Patton & General Bradley are portrayed as best friends whereas in real life, didn't care much for each other & Patton's best friend was General Eisenhower, etc) and the toning-down of Patton's actual phrases, this movie is nevertheless a stirring account of Patton in World War II. He had guts and a lot of balls. Rated PG.
0,I love this movie and can watch it over and over. It is a fabulous display of 1950s culture. As a modern woman in college, it was interesting for me to see such intelligent women toss their degrees aside in favour of just being a wife and mother. The character of Joan shows that this is not necessarily a bad thing. She wanted to be educated, but she also wanted the life of a wife and mother. Feminism isn't defined by excelling in your career and avoiding marriage at all costs. It's about being empowered to make your own choices. If a woman chooses to be a wife and mother, good for her. I think the movie did a fine job of showing the different choices women can make.		Aside from the feminism debate, this movie was just plain entertaining. I thoroughly enjoyed it and think others would, too. I like the story and its use of humour. I would recommend this movie to anyone who like low-key period pieces.
0,When I first purchased these discs over two years ago I paid $20 per disc (x7 discs...)  I want to give Bandai a great big hug for this set.  I love this series and hope as many intelligent people as possible see it.		I won't bore anyone with the details of the plot, story, etc...		Suffice to say, this is a vast improvement over the first series (SAC).  The main antagonist is one of the great characters of anime history (Kuze).  He is neither villain nor hero, but something necessary and in between and the animators and voice actors really bring this out.		The stand alone episodes are rich and entertaining and go to show a lot of each character's history.  The pace is steady and quick without being too fast.  Togusa (my favorite character) really moves into the forefront as one of the three most important characters.		The animation quality is strong and never wavers for a second (like other series who outsource to Korea).  The voice acting is strong in both Japanese and English.  I watch 95% of my anime in Japanese, but I really prefer this series in English for some odd reason!		If you like trippy, mind bending sci fi in the same vein as Blade Runner, Gattaca, and Logan's Run; then you MUST watch this series (and the 2 movies!)
0,This fantastic Doors history of their television appearances is being released in 4 different formats in both Europe and North America. For both the European market versions, which are being released earlier and the North American versions- you can choose from a Deluxe Set in either Blu-ray or regular dvd. Only the Deluxe Set includes a fantastic 40 page book that features a scrap book style presentation of each track including the song lyrics, photos, background information and trivia. This Deluxe Book Set comes in your choice of the Blu-ray or dvd versions. There will also be just the Blu-ray or dvd R-Evolution without the book for less money. The pre-order shown here is the Blu-ray North American U.S. version of just the Blu-ray. This is not the deluxe version with the extra 40 page book.		I'm certain many Doors fans, like myself, have seen some of The Doors television appearances over the years- even The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour Television Show- Season 3 dvd includes a couple of The Doors appearances, but nothing like what is included here on this set. This is not a complete history, as you will notice not every television performance or film is included, as I immediately noticed The Doors second song on the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour- Wild Child is not included, nor the famous Light My Fire from The Ed Sullivan Show. This is a history of The Doors Evolution on film appearances, as the title states, and not a complete history. Just seeing the Evolution of The Doors on film is wonderful enough, but it's the Bonus Material that make this worth watching. Included in this set are some very rare television appearances of The Doors, such as the band's full performance on Shebang, a Dick Clark interview, the color version of the band's appearance on Malibu U- including never before seen outtakes, and from German tv- the complete color version of Hello, I Love You. Besides television appearances over the years, you will also get to enjoy The Doors Films from the 80's, including a rare director's cut of the 1985 L.A.Woman short film.		There are Bonus Features that are simply fantastic as well. A new edit by Murray Lerner from the 1970 Isle Of Wight Festival is included, as well as the extremely rare 1966 Ford Motor Company film with The Doors providing the sound track. All the audio, with the exception of the Ford Motor Company film, has been restored by Bruce Botnick- The Doors long time engineer and co-producer of the last L.A. Woman album. There are 19 total television appearances and short films included on this simply fantastic set. Not only are the audios restored by Bruce Botnick, but I heard the videos have been restored fantastically as well!		Having these television appearances of The Doors finally complete with great audio and video restorations is a wish come true. My only other wish is that someone restores the Jim Morrison Highway film as well as The Doors Feast Of Friends film. I've waited decades for a good copy of these great short films and I really hope someone will bring them to dvd and hopefully Blu-ray soon for all of us Doors and Jim Morrison fans to enjoy as much as these television appearances! For now, I have to give a million THANKS to Eagle Rock Studios for all their hard work in bringing us Doors fans these fabulous television appearances and rarities- these are all MUST-HAVES for us Doors and Jim Morrison Fans!		Here are all 19 appearances and films included, and of course, the 40 page book is only included in the Deluxe Version- not this Blu-ray only.	01.)

0,the movie was great from the start.  The characters were well thought out and each actor/actress did a great job for the time frame of the movie.  Lots of actions and a little romance and overall great movie
0,These it's myu second movie from these actress, wonderful and funny, love the work and the easy to use features.
0,Best romantic movie of all times!!!
0,The greatest jim henson film of all time!
0,Blu ray transfer was good and movie was captivating. As usual,however, the extended cut was unnecesary.  Why can't directors learn that sometimes more is less and less is more.  I guess some people think if they're getting a few minutes more of the movie, they're getting more for their money.  By that logic, I guess the next horror will be to release all the film that was shot with no editing. Editors work very hard to create movies that don't drag.  If a scene is cut, it usually is because the film was better without it.  I can't think of a "director's cut" or "extended cut" that was better--or even as good--as the original theatrical version.
0,This film was one of the best ever made of werewolves.  The transition in the change from man to wolf is great.  Even watching it a third time was not boring.
0,This 1968 film is based on the book by Carson McCullers.  The basic story is still there, which is that of a deaf mute who helps people but somehow cannot help himself. But a lot is missing.  Alan Arkin, then 34 years old, plays the deaf mute and does a masterful job.  Sondra Locke plays a teenage girl whose family rents a room to Arkin, Stacy Keach plays a drunk.  And Cecily Tyson plays the angry grown daughter of the Afro-American physician played by Percy Rodriguez.  All are excellent in their roles.	The film is about loneliness in all its forms and is sometimes too sentimental and slow.  I understand that the story lines had to be changed in order to fit it all into a screenplay, but the result is an over-simplification of the complex novel. Without the richness of language and depth of characterization of the book, the film is a mere shadow of what I would have liked it to be. But the acting is so good and the theme of prejudice of various kinds against each of the flawed characters is done so well, even winning couple of Academy Award nominations, that it certainly has some things going for it.  I might have liked it more if I had not just read the book, which seems as fresh today as when it was written.  The screenwriter made a noble attempt, but he's just not Carson McCullers.
0,Kids loved it. Very fun movie.
0,This series is amazing and so addictive!  I am not one to binge watch but this I have been.  It's suspenseful, intriguing, thought provoking and really great.

0,This was cool - good lesson for people who talk a lot
0,As a New York kid, some movies just bring back how it all once was.  This movie is one of them as well as Taxi Driver, Saturday Night Fever and The Goodbye Girl.		While it's true that NY wasn't as decrepit as this movie portrays, it was very close.  I remember blocks upon blocks in Bklyn, Queens, Manhattan, and especially the Bronx as burnt out shells.  Landlords burned their buildings rather than take a loss in income.  Also, it was considered a viable option to have your car towed to a desolate part of NYC and blown up.  Hey, it was either that and collect comp insurance or let the repo man get it.  Also the trains really were scary.  The train near me was the IRT (numbered trains from 1 to 5).  You did not ride these trains unless it was during rush hour or you were with a large group of friends.  The trains were covered in grafiti, filthy and the lights did not work.  You could ride to and from NYC and be sitting in the dark 75% of the time. Also the stations were the habitat of the homeless and gang kids.  42nd Street was also a notorious red-light district but that never seemed to be an issue with us New Yorkers.  We laughed about it.		Anyway, this film is a landmark film on street kids, gang culture and 70's NY.  It's campy, true, but back then almost every New Yorker dressed like a refugee of Studio 54 and the Mudd Club.  The gangs represent a drugged out, punk rock version of lower class hell (By the way, Punk Rock was a New York invention, London stole it from us).  The Baseball Furies, in particular, scared the living daylights out of me.  You can imagine the mess I was in when Halloween came around and everyone was a Baseball Fury.  I loved the fact that the gangs were a mix mashup of all kinds of kids.  All of whom had one allegiance, to perpetuating neighborhood turf wars, everything else (gender and race) came afterwards.		This film launched the careers of James Remarr, Michael Beck, Mercedes Ruehl, David Patrick Kelly and Deborah Van Valkenburgh.  Valkenburgh's performance in particular is affecting.  She was one of the glamorous tv stars and in this film she was covered in dirt.  One of the best scenes is when she comes face to face with rich prom kids on the train.  She tries to tidy herself up but Beck's Swan stops her.  It captures NY class warfare at it's most brutal.		The soundtrack is, of course, fantastic.		I shudder over the remake news.  This film is, was and always will be about New York.  Now they will take it and turn it into some moralistic, stylistic, car ad to sell us junk.  How depressing.
0,Top level, just as one would expect from a Sandra Bullock project.  High family values throughout.
0,Great. I expected nothing less from a director like Guillermo del Toro. Great f/x great story and a perfect cast.
0,"The Band's Visit" is a charming, small film about misplaced people in foreign cultures that manages to have no overbearing message other than we're often more common than we want to think we are. After a language issues accidentally diverts the eight member Egyptian Alexandria Police Ceremonial Orchestra to the middle of nowhere, they have to depends, warily, on the kindness of Israeli strangers. The Israelis, led by free-spirited Dina (Ronit Elkabetz) separate the band between three families, the staid leader of the orchestra, General Tewfiq (Sasson Gabai) winds up with her.		Little scenarios come up that are more gentle than caustic in their conflict, and are often humorous, sometime melancholy. The scene where ladies man Khaled (Saleh Bakri) coaches the shy Papi at the roller-rink in the fine art of the Pick Up is hilarious. The scene where the frustrated composer Simon and his host Itzik dwell over lost idealism is sadly touching. But none of these scenes is forced or exploitative, while they've had the power to stay in my memory for quite some time. Watching Tewfiq attempt to explain music with his conductor's gestures alone made me love this film, and I recommend it highly for those who don't mind spending time with a movie that opens itself up gradually without banging you over the head.
0,plot was ok, action was great. little bloody at times.also kind of hard to figure out why the mother didn't just kill him earlier...
0,Great show
0,Good series, likable characters, humor all in an Irish setting. Delivered on time.
0,Eternally Your,  The slowly fell in love with each other they raelizing she had pick one of the husband's and had to let one of them go unfutchely,  she right guy at the end!!
0,One of my favorite movies.  Just the right amount of off-beat humor and action.  Great cast.
0,Great movie about dreams come true!
0,Not bad. You'll definitely laugh if you love the sicko jackass humor, but there was actually a story in there somewhere.
0,This is probably the most entertaining and interesting food show I have ever seen. Washington DC restauranteur Jose travels to a different region in Spain in every episode exploring the fresh ingredients and then is transported back to his home kitchen to show how to prepare incredible dishes. The best combination of travel show and food show , Made In Spain is beautifully filmed in some fabulous locations and Jose's interactions with the locals are incredibly entertaining. He is so excited about the various foods and recipes that it is impossible to watch this without dreaming of a trip to Spain.
0,I have the film on VHS and DVD. I only bought the DVD version because I thought it would be cleaned up. What a waste of money! The overall look is more grainy than the VHS tape and the missing scenes? Several scenes are missing or have been severely edited. Stay with the VHS tape until they can redo the DVD.
0,Evil Dead 2, Army of Darkness, Bubba-Ho-Tep And now My Name is Bruce. He's back in top form in this movie with dry humor and plenty of action to keep you watching even through the end credits. Bruce proves if you want it done right, you have to do it yourself. He wrote and directed this gem with a style that only he can achieve, with the help from friend Sam Raimi. Bruce makes plenty of jokes about himself and his movies in every way possible. I only hope he continues to write and direct and act in his  films because only Bruce knows Bruce. Other directors and writers of his other films from Alien Apocalypse to Sundown to The man with the screaming brain, don't really get Bruce. I already have watched my copy of this movie twice and enjoyed it more the second time than the first. Why?, because you hear more of the jokes the second time and the title song, Guan-Di becomes stuck in your head. So do yourself a favor, rent it, buy it or borrow it, you will have fun.
0,I've always hated sony as a company. Just type "sony rootkit virus" into a google search and you'll see what kind of company they are. The fact that they STILL have not released season four of facts of life or even season three of diff'rent strokes, is pathetic to say the least! But then imagine the horror of those waiting for season three of T.J. Hooker (coming up on the FIVE year mark). Another fine example of Sony wisdom; they released ONE season of "Riptide" and stopped. Canadian company VEI got the rights and released the entire series within a single YEAR. Three cheers for VEI for making Sony look like the clowns that they truly are! A shame VEI can't get the rights to Facts and Diff'rent Strokes.		They should really just release the ENTIRE series of Fact of Life and Diff'rent strokes, ALL AT ONCE.... in a low cost package like the Sanford and Son and Good Times releases. The packaging may not be great, but at least the ENTIRE series is released AT ONCE and we don't have to put up with the horror that is SONY.		SONY SUCKS!	Indeed!
0,Everyone has summed up the themes of the movie in these reviews. The only thing I can add is that if you are not an Al Pacino fan, you are going to be. If you don't know who Bobby Carnavale is,  you will remember his name now. If you thought Jennifer Garner was just a sexy star with a sweet face, you will think again.		This was one of the more suspenseful, emotionally satisfying movies I've ever seen. Even the one predictable scene was such a small part of the movie that it doesn't matter in the end. Such a good experience to see this film!
0,i bought this for later
0,nice

0,The members of the unit continue to work very well together.  Especially like this part.  The wives however irritate me a bit since being military myself, this is how military wives tend to act.  The only exception is Molly Blaine, this part is played very well.
0,This is a really good and interesting movie.  We really enjoyed this movie, it is worth watching! Enjoy this one!!
0,Perfect gift for my sister's collection.
0,nobody does it like Mel Brooks, (making fun of the Nazis) a laugh out loud movie, no matter how many times you see it, great  performance by Anne Bancroft, Charles Durning & Jose Ferrer, and of course "The Great Bronski" whom Mel Brooks plays, the nazis envade Poland and when they encounter "Bronski and his troupe' there is an eruption of murder, mayham  and maniacal improvising to protect the Polish Underground, great fun , I am so glad to find this comedy at such a great price
0,very interestingly done and had a few laughs too, good spoof of 007
0,I teach "MacBeth" and I find this version a realistic one-- bloody and raw. I would recommend it for students-- AFTER they read the play.
0,This South Korean import from PD Entertainment is an excellent buy.  The sound and picture quality are good.  It's a pity that a classic film like this one hasn't been released in the United States.
0,Let's just say this film is full of surprises. I was impressed with the quality of the film and the overall cast as well. I would definitely recommend this movie!
0,The movie was really good.  There were a few slow moments when I almost dozed off, but for the majority of the movie it was action packed with good special affects.  I liked the story line which branched out from the standard stranded in space adventure of movies past.  I would recommend this movie.
0,I have always liked Stargate and enjoy watching all their episodes.  All of their movies are captivating to me.  Maybe in the near future, someone will discover a REAL stargate??????
0,Monster Classics 5 stars love them all!
0,Good action, and family fun
0,War baby's delight; the heroes I grew up with.
0,This was a very good, entertaining, suspenseful movie.  The acting is very good and the locations are nicely chosen.  Very enjoyable!
0,I really enjoyed the Fight Science series, which investigated martial arts scientifically to determine how fast people were striking, if the blows would be lethal, how much force was produced, and stuff like that.  Deadliest Warrior was also entertaining, as it pitted historical adversaries against each other to see who would "win".  I like Human Weapon because it literally 2 people with pretty extensive fighting experience and then had them spend time getting crash courses in all these other martial arts to see what they could learn.  Surprisingly, they generally fared pretty well.  The only thing I wish is that they had fought masters, as opposed to "champions", since I would really like to see what the absolute best could offer.  Besides that, covers a lot of martial arts and explains how they evolved, where they came from, and what they are doing today.  Well worth watching if you are into martial arts, or even just history.
0,Superb casting, unbeatable writing.
0,i totally love the harry potter movies! I'm so glad i've got the final chapter to add to my collection.
0,May not be appropriate for young kids, but laugh out loud funny for everyone else.  I remember the first time I watched this, it was with my Dad.  We both just laughed & laughed
0,Great set of films.  This set includes my favorite version of "A Christmas Carol".  "Christmas in Connecticut"  however is a perfect film to watch on a cold Winters Night.  My only problem with his set is that "A Christmas Carol" had a colorized version made years ago.  That was released on vhs years ago but has never made it on DVD.
0,While the story lines are fictitious, the history of Bletchley during WWII reminds us that women played important roles, and actually the work they did has been estimated to have shortened WWII by two years!
0,Unusally good non-high-budget film. The characters were excellent & so was the acting. I didn't give it 5 stars because the ending was too amorphus, it shouldn't have left so much to conjecture.
0,But it's still a very good feature. This can be a tool used in teaching about sexual harassment. I think it's also a film that can be used in marriage counselling classes as you really feel sorry for the husband, and the fact that he has to go through the come-ons by the temp, but he should've told his wife about it in the first place. I found this to be the dark side of going to work. I have come to the conclusion that work isn't a social outlet, and it doesn't pay to find out how the other co-workers are doing. It's also becoming where you have to keep yourself...just keep saying you're F.I.N.E. you can fill in the blanks. I honestly don't know if work was supposedly at one time a way of making friends, or not....who knows we may have been all wrong about socializing with our co-workers, giving hugs, dating each other. If that wasn't what we were supposed to do at work then we've put each other in danger. I don't know the answers to this. It's just a crying shame that something as innocent as a hug can be construed as a sexual come-on, and that some people are ignored, not part of the team, or part of the family while others are fortunate to have friends at work, possibly soul mates. Me being one of the many who are ignored sympathize with all the others out there who are ignored. The ones who get in trouble for being vulnerable, and feel like they don't just belong. I feel for each and everyone of you I wish I could say that your co-workers will like you, and everything will be fine...well it may very well be if you find the right place to work to have social outlets. However, don't do what was done in this feature....it may cost you your life. I know I've said I would rather work out of my house instead of going to work anymore, but I may not have that option, so until I find that job where I feel like I belong, and can have friends at work...possibly a soul mate I will just have to watch out, and be careful with who I want to be friends with at work.
0,Its pretty good
0,Next to Ninja Scroll and Wicked City, which I will buy on blu-ray if they ever come out on blu-ray.
1,Metropolis is one of the all-time great films, that goes without saying. It is a well crafted story of opression of the working class when cold-hearted capitalism takes hold. What really impresses me about this  film though, is the wonderful sets, which are very advanced for its  day.	The DVD of Metropolis on the other hand, doesn't do the film  justice. The print is often so scratchy it is not exactly clear what is  going on. If you cannot find a copy of this film anywhere else go ahead and  get this. Only if a better copy can't be found though, because a clearer  print would be worth the money. By way of extra features, this DVD only has  one worth mentioning. This is the trivia game. At the end of the film there  is a multiple choice game that asks questions about the content of the  film. It's amusing, but only the first time you play it.
1,Bland. No excitement. Unconvincing. Don't waste your money.
1,Before I finally turned it off. I had seen and liked her first thing years ago, so when my gf (a big Cho fan) picked this out I was like "okay".		We watched for about 15 minutes, waiting to laugh or even be slightly amused. No dice. We fast-forwarded; more of the same.		The whole show is apparently joke-free and consists of a shrill left-wing political screed using 'newsworthy' events from 2003-2004, interspersed with long silences and Cho making weird faces or staring dully off into space. It was sort of like being forced to watch Bill O'Reilly of Fox News fame, only if you put him in drag and made him into an anarcho-communist somehow.		Very annoyingly dull, boring, and pointless. Save your time and money by staying far far away from this! (Note - other anarcho-communists may find the show minutely entertaining, but would probably have a lot more fun by just turning on the news and righteously yelling at the stupidity).
1,This A-TEAM box set is just another unnecessary gag that Universal is trying to sell to make money during todays grim economy and perhaps Universals way of trying to compensate for all the flaws they made with all the previous individual season DVD box sets with the dual sided discs since alot of them skipped and froze alot just like alot of the individual season DVD box sets of KNIGHT RIDER, MAGNUM, PI, and MIAMI VICE all did with their double-sided discs by redoing each episode on single-sided DVD discs instead just like Universal did with making the complete series DVD box sets of THE INCREDIBLE HULK, KNIGHT RIDER, and MIAMI VICE.		Overall, THE A-TEAM was a real cool show about 4 modern day Robin Hood mercenaries for hire and 3 out of 4 of THE A-TEAM members were Vietnam vets who were desperados on the lamb from the Army for a crime they didn't even commit in the first place who specialized in impossible situations to the helpless and oppressed people in need, especially when and where the police couldn't help with the help of the eccentric Howling Mad Murdock(Dwight Shultz)which was the only A-Team member who wasn't on the run from the military.		This was an awesome show during the first 2 seasons when they had newspaper reporter Amy Allen(Melinda Culea), but when Amy departed the show in the mid Fall of 1983 after Melinda Culea was fired, the show started getting stale and wasn't nearly as cool to watch without Amy anymore which was briefly replaced by newspaper reporter Tawnia Baker(Marla Heasley)in January of 1984 before she departed the show in September of 1984 due to a fall-out Marla Heasley had with George Peppard.		Therefore THE A-TEAM was starting to lose its thunder and was out of its honeymoon phase of the show when THE A-TEAM kicked off its 3rd Season in the Fall of 1984 when THE A-TEAM went back to only 4 guys since this show no longer had any female co-stars in it since Marla Heasley quit the show after only 8 episodes and Melinda Culea was fired in November of 1983 after the first 9 episodes of THE A-TEAMs 2nd Season.		Therefore the 3rd Season on up left us mourning the loss of Amy and Tawnia making this show became even less and less interesting especially since the departure of Amy and Tawnia made this show even more stale since THE A-TEAM didn't seem to have the same kind of chemistry anymore as it did in the first 2 seasons, especially opposed to THE A-TEAMs 1st Season which was why I stopped watching this show on NBC in January of 1985.
1,Audio is listed as English. It isn't. I was unable to follow movie while reading the subtitles.
1,Terrible movie
1,This movie sucks. The audio only works in one speaker, the movie didn't make any sense. And besides it was all a joke once again. If I wanted  that I would have watched April Fools Day. Terrible movie.
1,1st off - I am a HUGE fan of Edgar Wright and his previous movies.  Shaun of the Dead = 4.5 stars, Hott Fuzz = 5 stars, Scott Pilgrim = 6 stars (yes, I like it that much).		This starts off promising then devolves into an absolute mess.  DO NOT BUY THIS!  Rent 1st.
1,mind numbing
1,Didn't realize this was a Syfy channel movie until the very obvious cuts for commercials started on the DVD. Decent practical effects, okay story, but first-time actors and incredibly poor CGI monsters ruin the movie.
1,No...just no.
1,Proof Tom Hanks is the most overrated actor.... ever?		Except for Bachelor Party.
1,expected more.
1,A bunch of actors sitting around one day getting high and thinking hey I need a few hundred thousand dollars so let's just make something up and play ourselves and just wing it. Our fans are so dumb they will pay to watch.		I am pretty sure that is the scenario that preceded this movie. It was painfully bad!
1,Has not aged very well. Interesting when it first came out, but rather boring now.
1,Blu-ray gets a 2 disc director's cut while dvd gets only a pos single disc with only the theatrical cut.  Getting tired of having some studios try to shove blu ray down my throat by withholding all good special features and added footage.  DVD is still the top selling format.  Wish they'd just give us the quality of discs we used to get.
1,there isn't a plot to the movie, don't even waste your time watching it, it is a waste
1,terrible plot... terrible acting. thoughtless and mind numbing. never saw a kevin bacon movie i didn't like until this one.
1,This was just plain boring.  It had a very convoluted plot which was just dumb and not very entertaining.
1,I had a real tough time getting to the end of this film.  Oh, not due to the blood and gore as I love blood and gore.  It was just due to the slow and boring almost non-existent story line.  I had read strong reviews and bought it immediately as I love all things Zombie.  I had over a bunch of my friends for Zombie Movie night and 3 out of 6 of us actually fell asleep!  Sorry but it wasn't the beer as I tried to watch it again cold sober and guess what?  The snoring started.  If you are looking for a great bed time story to put you to sleep, this is your film!  If you are looking for a Zombie movie in the same vein then try Diary of The Dead.
1,This movie had so much promise but ended up being a dud.
1,Or anything else Star Wars for that matter.		It's time to show George that he no longer rules the universe as he once did.  And the only way to do that is to hit him where he'll actually notice, his pocket book.  He obviously doesn't listen to anything or anyone else.		Why shouldn't you buy these Original Trilogy (OT) DVDs?		First, the movies won't be anamorphic.  To quote Bill Hunt of The Digital Bits web site, "Anamorphic enhancement is the widely accepted industry standard for the presentation of widescreen films on DVD".  Is it really that bad that the movies won't be anamorphic, well not really, but it's symptomatic of the reasons for George releasing these movies.  He's only doing it because he's feeling forced to do, but he's not going to be nice about it, so no anamorphic print.  Very lame.  And besides, that process really doesn't cost all that much to begin with.		Second, according to George these movies will be from the best source material available, baloney.  They are from the Laserdisc masters, which for the time, were great.  But compared to today's movies they are sub-par.  Lucasfilm says there are no longer any valid "source material" copies of the OT because he had them all destroyed when they release the "Special Edition" version.  Again baloney.  Many copies of the original movies do exist in private collections, film history archives and other places that he cannot destroy.  Anyone of these could be used to create an true cleaned up OT version.  I still have my copy of the Star Wars: The Definitive Collection release and it's an okay print, but with a little cleaning up it could be fantastic.		Third, he says he doesn't want to allocate the resources to the cleanup.  Fine.  There are any number of studios who have said they would get better copies of the prints (even the source for the LD prints would be fine) and clean them up and make them anamorphic for no charge.  They just want to be associated with the project.		Yes, they're his movies and he has the right to make changes (whether you agree or not with the changes) as he sees fit.  And while I don't like the changes he's made (especially in Star Wars which, in my opinion, were atrocious) I am willing to let the director do what he fells is best for his movies and support or not support these changes by purchasing or not purchasing the updated versions.  There will always be arguments about the validity of "Director's Cuts" (think Blade Runner and Brazil) but the simple answer is they are "Director's Cuts" and they can do what they want with "their" movies.  According to Lucas, the "Special Edition" version is the true vision that he had for the movies.  If that is truly the case George, why the waffling on the different OT versions.  Go with one and stick with it.  Period.  This so-called acquiescence to the fans to release the original movies has been downright insulting, condescending and not worthy of a studio as great as Lucasfilm is (or has been in the past).		And the final reason to not buy these movies is simple:  George says he is releasing them to, and I'm paraphrasing here, "appease the fans".  [...]!  He's releasing them for one simple reason.  Money.  Think about it.  Every time something new for Star Wars has come out, he's released some version on DVD.  He's planning on releasing a super-duper box set of all the movies in a couple of years as well as the HD-DVD versions, what kind of teasers is he going to release between now and then.  He knows he can release anything with the words Star Wars on them and we'll buy them.		Well not anymore for this consumer.  I've given ol' George the last dime I ever will.  In fact, I'm boxing up my "Special Edition" version of the OT on DVD and sending them back to George with this note.  I have the Laserdisc editions and while dated in their look and feel, they are truly the "original trilogy".  I might even send back all three prequel DVDs as well just to prove the point.
1,don't waste your time.  cusack and jennifer carpenter are good.  the movie is a silence of the lambs ripoff with a twist.  but really its not worth the hours of your life that you will give up watching this drivel.  its also not based on a true story, which it says it is.
1,I was kind of disappointed because of the"well known" actors and the story line.  I was unprepared for the brutality and bloodiness of the movie, not in Viet Nam but home, in Texas.		I personally feel that this movie had the potential for being more realistic, as far as being a prisoner of war for eight years, and suffering from post traumatic stress.  First of all, I think the excellent (I realize he didn't have much experience yet, but was still quite talented) Tommy Lee Jones deserved a much larger part, as he was extremely good in the scenes he played.  You could feel his rage, loneliness, suffering, isolation and inability to associate to his old surroundings.  Of course, his family seemed totally unaware of his suffering or what he had endured.		The beginning was absolutely brutal, and his wife telling  William Devane, she was leaving him on the day of his homecoming was cruel and inhuman.  I'm not a screenwriter, of course, but the movie just didn't have the "right" feeling.  It had the potential of being more moving,heartbreaking, and  realistic, if it concentrated on what these two Viet Nam victims had to go through coming home.  The way they had been violated and were still being violated by the U.S. government (forgotten all about), misunderstood by their family, getting councelling or some way to help them endure their particular torture of being a prisoner or simply being a part of the war and all their anguish.		The brutal beginning about his son, the money, losing his hand and the horror didn't seem to be as horrific as their psychological trauma.  Their are so many movies today, "No country for Old Men" which made sense in the context of the story for all the cruelty,  disregrard for human life, violence and gore.		It should have shown rehabilitation for the two victims and possibly  able to go on to some sort of sembelence of a life.  In any well known, Viet Nam movie ie "The Deer Hunter" you are always left scarred, at least to some degree.
1,Jamie Fox ruined the film in the last 30 minutes.		SPOILER		Fox happens to figure out everything in the last 30 minutes.
1,Too silly.
1,First, if you are going to name a film Alien 51, you need to place some emphasis on the creature.  Apparently, it was a recycled creature from another film (see the movie El Chupacabra, a film I haven't seen, but have added it to my list) and nothing created from any sort of imagination or originality.  That already says a lot about where the quality of this picture is going to come from.  If their main character is actually a creature from another film, our filmmakers have already cheated us from any sort of value. Recycling creatures in a non-mocumentary sort of way is an insult and immediately my DVD player should have dispensed the total amount spent on this rental.  As if it isn't bad enough that the creature is from another film, it also has as much screen time as Dame Judi Dench did in Shakespeare in Love, actually probably less.  Where is the alien during most of this film?  I honestly thought that his agent was probably suggesting that he not participate in this production because it could ultimately hurt his career as an extra terrestrial.  "Don't expect to hear from Spielberg if you continue with Alien 51." I could hear his agent saying.  Nonetheless, he does make a small "cameo" role near the end where tempers flair, emotions rise, and the excitement of the final credits are finally in sight.		Second, if you are making a movie and you cannot get anyone to headline, then I would reconsider using Heidi Fleiss.  Now, I am not an actor at all, but I have seen several independent films, and I can say this.  She cannot act at all.  In fact, there were some special features on this DVD which allowed you to see the director giving instructions to the actors, and I just couldn't help but think that Fleiss' comments were going in one ear and out the other.  I am surprised to witness that the director just didn't go "postal" on everyone when they chose to do their own form of acting instead of following the directions presented to them.  Perhaps, and this may throw my image of this film completely off, but just maybe that was the director's style of filmmaking.  I have never witnessed a director who wanted to be cheap, allow his cast to walk in and out of scenes, and demonstrate that an entire community of women must have had some form of breast implants, but maybe that is what our dual directors, Brennon Jones and Paul Wynne (yep, it took two to butcher these cinematic moments), wanted to ultimately create.  If that is the case, then they have done a wonderful job and should be congratulated for their slackish behavior and performances.  I would love to know what their budget was on this film because honestly, you could have paid me nothing and I would have found better material.  Ok, you have a character named Doctor PsychoBilly.  It really cannot get much worse than that.		Finally (while there are many, many, many more, I will stop here), whomever wrote this script I do believe was heavily under the influence of some banned substance, or possibly watched too much Anchorman and decided to act like Brick while writing.  Either way, the lines in this film were the most enjoyable to listen to because they were possibly the worst ever written by another human being.  I am not afraid to go on the record with that statement.  My favorite line in the entire film was when Cleo and the police officer were walking around at night (yet, it was so bright outside from the apparent spotlights) and she throws him on the ground, takes her top off and attempts to show him her scar from an earlier alien encounter.  His response to her being on top of him and taking her top off was, "I am supposed to be looking at your scar right".  HA.  You could hear it in his voice that he was already too excited to have a woman on top of him topless.  It literally had me in stitches on the ground.  Thank you for writing comedy, this film needed it!		Grade: * out of *****
1,Episode 3 of CD 1 is horribly mastered, like a 12-for-24 frame transfer rate.  Like watching Russian television.  Or watching it ater a bad bad bender.		Great series, and this is the first problem I've had with the DVD releases.
1,Bad acting
1,Julia and show have been up for so many awards.  I really wanted to like it.  But, I couldn't finish the episode. If there was any humor it was lost in the contant foul language.  I'm not a prude, I get some foul language, but, this was the F word almost every other word spoke by everyone.  Big Big disappointment.... I like Julia Louis-Dreyfus so I was really disillusioned.
1,I love the movie a Knights tale.  10 years ago I owned a DVD of it and remember the deleted scenes and extras were great.  I lost the copy in a divorce, but no biggie I'll upgrade to Bluray... and the extras are I can pick the language?  WTH people, you're sooooo lazy you couldn't even just stick the existing extras onto the Bluray?  It literally would have cost nothing since it all exists already
1,"Noon" is the funniest and most enjoyable film Jackie Chan has made.and "Knights" is just one small notch below "Noon." I enjoyed them both very much.
1,What a sorry excuse for a horror film. Rob Zombie doesn't know jack about horror!!!!
1,Didnt like it.
1,I had high expectations for this movie.  Normally, I love this genre: high adventure with lots of CGI.  I assumed it was a no-brainer, who could ruin a readymade concept like this?	They lost my interest during the first few minutes and nothing they could slam at the screen after that could coax me into liking this movie (not even the wildly amusing performance by Luis Guzman).	It's obvious that they spent a fortune on the effects then forgot to waste a dime on the script.  To suggest the story was "dumbed-down" for the benefit of children is to do the writers a disservice; they took all of five minutes to slap their story together, ripped it right out of the official playbook of stupidity.  This was Jules Verne for Dummies.  This is what you get when people who lack originality have to muck about with someone else's work.  Worse.  They thought no one would notice the lacking in their script if they ran everything at a breakneck speed.  They had everything working like clockwork, starting with the clich of the angst-riddled brat oozing with attitude (Josh Hutcherson), to the nitwit grandfather (Michael Caine), the comic sidekick (Luis Guzman) and the obligatory babe in training (Vanessa Hudgens), with poor Dwayne Johnson doing double time trying to act out the part of the put upon stepfather.  Every aspect of this movie was a contrivance, there only for the convenience of an inadequately thought out story that was little more than a series of sight gags cobbled together.  What was this, a commercial for the merits of 3D?  (If you didn't get the point straight off, they happily repeated things in slow motion!)	Just once I'd like to see a film without a snotty teen in the starring role.  Not only is it an aching clich, it's also not that entertaining to watch.  Kids like that you ground, you don't take them on vacation and hope they'll snap out of it.  That only works in the movies.  Or not.
1,Fans of Billy Bob will enjoy this movie, and people will probably buy it for Halle Berry's Academy Award-winning performance. The steamy bedroom scenes will attract some viewers.  All in all, the movie has a slightly manic quality.  Halle Berry plays the role of convict's wife and bereaved mother without much gradation, and comes across as slightly hysterical throughout. (Her acceptance speech at the Awards seemed a continuation of this "take".)  Billy Bob plays a phlegmatic, decent man who has his own memory-demons to conquer.  The movie is diverting but fails to satisfy.
1,Beautiful Wave has flaws all over the place.  It's one major flaw!  It's about a teenage girl who apparently lacks motivation and has low self-esteem.  She has to find a way to spend her precious time, so... she hooks up with a couple surfer guys, takes a trip to the ocean, learns how to ride the waves by herself because the guys are too busy flirting with other girls to really teach her anything, and this results in a large chunk of the storyline being downright boring, miserable and uninteresting.  It's a really awful film.		The only enticing part is when the gang ends up crossing the border and has to deal with a couple barely understandable border patrolmen who'd like nothing more than to arrest a bunch of kids that certainly look like they're up to no good.  Right from the get go you can tell it's a low budget movie because there's an eerie silence in the background in between lines that makes it feel more like a high school play.		So what IS this supposed to be about?  The girl is supposed to travel around with a map to uncover family secrets but trust me, there's NO adventure occurring whatsoever.  At least, not during the first half when practically nothing at all happens.  Beautiful Wave is too bland and doesn't deliver a worthwhile enough storyline to contain any adventure.  A must skip.
1,Don't waste your time.
1,Terrible - that's all I can say.  In fact, I couldn't finish watching the movie.  If you want to see people wasting their lives for absolutely NO reason, plus a mother that is just plain stupid about her kid, then this is the movie for you.  I hated all the characters, especially the character played by Ellen Burstyn.  Yuck.
1,I was not pleased with movie store.  They never sent my movie or replied back when i sent them messages.  Amazon returned my money though.  I won't order from them again.
1,This was my first zombie movie. I never watch zombie movies, I made a mistake when I rented it. If I'd read a little more carefully I would have realized it was an F 'ing zombie movie. My mistake. You might like it, I thought it was very boring. I give it two stars because I was able to watch it all the way through to the end and I've seen worse. It's actually just a good one star move. One to ten, it's a two. Almost totally lacking in dramatic tension. Dumb dumb, Dumb dumb dumb dumb, Dumb dumb dumb.
1,The movie was beautiful in every way until the end - except for the mother. I know the same scenario takes place every day around the world, but movies are supposed to entertain, not depress us. There definitely should have been a happy ending.
1,I never watched it, refund ?
1,It's a great fell good movie for kids under 8, any older and you'll be questioning why you're watching it.
1,Don't expect much
1,Historical drama is definately my genre so I was drawn to this.  All I can say was that it scarcely held my attention...and I'm not that particular.  The acting was annoying and some of "ze French accents" were annoying and difficult to understand.  The leading lady, though lovely, used only one expression through most of the movie.  The female protagonist overacted her role which was emphasized all the more by the underacting of other characters.  It was difficult to follow; they drug out parts they didn't need to and didn't elaborate where they should have.  All in all, a very unsastisfying experience.
1,I apologize to fans of this show, but it was absolutely unwatchable.  Believe me... I tried.  I loved Battlestar Gallactica, but this prequel was awful.  It was poorly written, full of plot holes, and it was more than difficult to relate to any of the characters.  They should have stopped with BSG, just like Lucas should have stopped with episode VI.
1,No plot. Horrible acting. And not ONE SINGLE FUNNY MOMENT! How do dogs like this get made? Who did the producers sleep with to get the money? Did anyone actually read the rag before signing on for this?		Not Funny. Not funny. Not funny. Not funny.		Avoid like the plague. Do not buy or rent. If you know someone who did, slap them until they wake up....then slap them again for their stupidity.		One star only because Amazon doesn't allow a -10.
1,You'll want to build a Bon fire and throw the entire movie, insert photo and case and let this trash burn up.		The only thing that gives this d movie a star rating is Adam West of Batman fame, Trevor Lissauer who later became known in Sabrina the teenage witch, and Carmen Electra who became well known for her time in baywatch, playboy, and other projects.		And seriously who puts a dog in the microwave?!!!
1,You don't see anything. The girls don't do anything. Half of the movie you can't see anything because its so dark.if you are thinking about seeing this movie because of the cove don't.they are cute but they don't do anything that you will talk about.
1,I can't go down to 1 star because it's Willie, but what's really disappointing is that the setlist is so awesome, however Willie simply refuses to sing and instead "talks" the lyrics like others have stated.  I would recommend the Willie and Ray Charles dvd instead of this one.
1,I've been looking forward to this day for quite some time and I'm sorry to say the anticipation was greater than it's arrival. This is  poor video transfer! I'm very disappointed in the poor quality of this blu ray dvd. I have many old b&w blu rays going as far back as 1931,and I'm sorry to say this is the poorest blu ray dvd in my rather extensive collection. I wish they had done a better job. I felt compelled to pause the dvd and write this review before returning to the dissapointing conclusion of this great but poorly done movie. Save your money and watch your old dvd version...I wish I had!
1,Just to much sex in it for me.
1,This movie is so lame.		There is to much useless gratuitous sex that has no point to the story.	Simon sleeps in the nude and has no problems undressing in front of people, which is stupid. Oh ya I am going to a place to do some research and get video taped 24/7 and like to show off my weenier.	I found my self fast forwarding through the sex scenes, because they slowed down a already slow movie.		I just wish I could give this junk 0 stars
1,This is my favorite Capra film.  I bought it because I never tire of it--that is, until I got this DVD.  This film badly needs to be remastered.  The picture and sound quality of this DVD are awful.  Hopefully, someone will release a better copy.  I'll try again when that happens.
1,Poor, horrific, sad, terrible, laughable, dimwitted and moronic are words that best describe this "epic picture," "2012" but even that cannot fully articulate how incredibly awful and boring and abominable this movie is. From the over-dramatic made-for-TV performances to the lousy writing, editing and script to the hairball storyline that moves around faster than the people getting up to leave this movie, this is totally abysmal from the moment the huge "2012" title is imposed over the movie screen to the final credits.		It is hard to believe that anyone with connected brain cells would consider this utter effluent entertainment in even the most naive sense of the word. Because there is nothing fun, interesting or even educational about this movie. Instead, this movie, like a root canal, is holding on to that last painful nerve and simply won't let go. And who in the world wrote this screenplay, and why did he bother?		None of the actors are worth a hill of beans, but Woody Harrelson perhaps wins the award for the most foolish character thrown into this bag of mixed nuts. Yes, everyone does know his name, because he's made such a lousy name for himself, appearing in so many repugnant movies. But "2012" is without a doubt the proverbial notch on his bedpost that will banish Mr. Harrelson to infomercial hell.		And whose bright idea was it to cast John Cusack in the lead role? The man has about as much charm and charisma as a bag of broken glass shards. With all the money wasted on this turkey one would think the producers and studio big-shots would have paid a little more attention to who was staring in this picture.		As someone who not only paid for full admission but who also regrettably sat through this entire bomb I can wholeheartedly attest that the only pleasure I derived from this entire ordeal was leaving the multiplex. If you want to waste 2 hours of your time by being bored to sheer agony then by all means please watch this movie. Otherwise go scrub your kitchen floor, put away your dishes or re-grout your bathroom; your time will be much better spent and you'll be eons more thrilled, and amused.
1,Terrible
1,This workout is ok, but I am not a fan of Emily Welsh so it is really hard for me to workout with her. I find her very unmotivating.
1,movie was confusing, poor lighting and hard to follow. There were flashbacks, flash forwards and flash nows. It was tuff to keep tract of.
1,If guys wearing heavy mascara and spiked dog collars is your bag, then this is your new favorite movie. If not avoid this garbage at all cost. Notice all the positive reviews were written within a few days of each other. Obviously people involved in what I'm sure was a financial train wreck. Trevor Goddard is fortunate to ever having been cast is any legitimate roll again after being involved in this fetid trash heap of a video. As for it being in any way an authentic depiction of the "Goth" lifestyle, maybe in someones ninth grade wet dream.  Everything about this video is just insulting to the intelligence.
1,Really bad!
1,The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars is that the settings, costumes and atmosphere do a great job of evoking London at the time of Jack the Ripper.  However, I found it unnecessary and disrespectful to the memory of Abberline to have him portrayed as a druggy and a "psychic".  The facts are interesting enough; why this embellishment?  To appeal to today's audience who seem to relish uncontrolled substances?  It is my feeling that most serious Ripper fans would not only be disappointed in this film, but also find it a very poor depiction of everyone involved, including the prostitutes.  They are much too "pretty" in this film.  Filmakers seem adverse to portraying these poor, unfortunate ladies of the evening as the sorry alcoholic, sometimes toothless and very ill women that they were.  But I guess audiences are more attracted to pretty faces then to reality.
1,stupid movie
1,Poorly written and acted
1,Can't believe I wasted money on this movie.  Alien abductions have been done before, and the ideas here seem dated.  I think the director should have had a pre-screening, and tried to correct the deficiences.
1,I purchased this movie and previously purchased a Vizio television with an AMAZON VIDEO App that includes an "Amazon" BUTTON on the remote control - PURCHASED not rented - in reliance on the availability of this AND MANY OTHER MOVIES for viewing by my PERMANENTLY DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED 26 YEAR OLD daughter on the AMAZON Video App on the remote because she is not, as a consequence of her disability, able to maneuver screens and log-ins on a television.  In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!! Do not BUY ANY AMAZON VIDEOS unless you intend to purchase a new television every year to keep up with Amazon's unscrupulous and fraudulent business practices.
1,I have never read the book so I only watched this movie to see how it compared to "zombie-themed" (NightOfTheLivingDead, Zack Snyder's "Dawn-remake" etc) from prior years. That said, they should have called this movie, "World War Z-Z-Z-Z's", as in 'Y-A-W-N'ss, starring Brad Pitt & a cast of nobodies!	To anyone who watches this film, you will only get your $$$'s worth from the opening scene & subsequent chaos in Philly. After that, the movie becomes boring,........ b-o-r-i-n-g,........... B-O-R-I-N-G!!!!!!	You keep getting introduced to emotionally flat, cardboard supporting characters so quickly, one after the other like going thru cheap suits lined & hung up in a dept store rack and then disappear just as fast- that the viewer is never given enough time to understand their purpose or have empathy for thus I found myself unable to root for them.	The zombies themselves are mainly background clutter & are never given any characterization or lengthy screen time to be considered really 'villainous' or scary.	Brad Pitt turns in yet another in a long line of his "little boy lost expressions while implausibly coming up with cliched last sec ideas to escape or solutions to disasters" performance, which he's made a career of. And considering he's the only 'credible actor' in this film, that ain't saying much.	If you're looking for similar zombie-themed flick only with some real suspense, I recommend you check out "Train To Busan" instead!	Wait a few more years til this film falls in the '.99cent bin' before you think about spending your $$$ on it!
1,Some pretty lame attempts to copy the original series just don't work, at least as a comedy. Sure, there were a few laughs but strangely enough, it works better as an action and suspense film.		Steve Carell does an okay job of portraying Agent 86 as does Anne Hatahway as Agent 99. However, someone should  have told Carell that when he says "Missed it by that much" he is suppose to indicate how much with his fingers but Carell just says it and his words, as in most of the film, carry no punch.		Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and Alan Arkin both do good jobs. Dalip Singh (WWE/WWF star) who looks suprisingly like a pumped version of the "Jaws" character from the Bond Films (The Spy Who Loved Me, et al), played by Richard Kiel, provides the physical punch and came through as one of the more authentic characters although his crying scene was also pretty lame.		It seemed like most of the other characters, including a few from the "Heroes" TV series were just thrown in for comedic effect but without further character development, thy just fell flat.		Finally, the DVD promises 20 extra minutes ("62%) of "More Laughs." I could only sit through the first 5 minutes of these. They were just too stupid. This script tried way too hard to be something it was not.
1,After all the hype, I was totally bored and lost interest.
1,I only ordered this movie because a friend suggested it to me. It was really slow and I lost the movie before i could finish it. :( if you are really into RPG's and have dry humor this may be the film for you, it just wasn't my cup of tea.
1,Friends, I've been a Quentin Tarantino fan since PULP FICTION hit the theaters, and I saw it at least 4 times on it's original release.  But no matter how much of a fan I am, I cannot condone what he has done here.  IB starts with a great premise:  A small unit of American Jewish G.I.'s are sent in to occupied France to terrorize the Germans by ambushing, bush-wacking, way-laying, sabotaging, and (HERE'S THE KICKER) SCALPING as many Nazis as they can.  Seems plausible.  Then Tarantino gathers the entire Nazi high-command in ONE movie THEATER in Paris, and BLOWS THE THEATER UP, killing them all... JUST 3 WEEKS AFTER D-DAY!!!!!!  Yes, Tarantino has KILLED HITLER 10 months earlier than the Fuhrer actually blew his brains out!!!  YES, I KNOW it's Tarantinos FAIRY-TALE about WWII.  But for Christs sake!!!!  I was expecting something on the level of Band of Brothers, and I got a film that is so bad it not only is NOT Mickey Mouse, it ain't even BETTY BOOP!!!!  Some GREAT writing, TWO PHENOMENAL PERFORMANCES (one of which DESERVEDLY garnered an OSCAR for best actor in a supporting role), but this does not make-up for the debilitating historical inaccuracy of the overall production.  I only give it one star because I cant give it NO STARS!!!!
1,But maybe if enough of us say it, the company will actually DO something about it!  WHAT IS UP WITH NOT HAVING A WIDESCREEN VERSION!?!?  I was definitely going to purchase this special edition until I saw it was only available in full screen.  I'm just so glad that I got the previous release, since they were actually smart enough to add widescreen to that version.  I'll skip the special features if I have to.  By the way, I would have loved to seen the "Lights, Camera, Annie!" behind the scenes documentary that another reviewer posted about.  Well, I hope they get it right when they release yet another version in a few years.
1,Very stupid movie. I forgot how cheesy some of the 70's/80's movies were.
1,A bit over the top on the violence.
1,Made me uncomfortable in a creepy way.  Didn't even get a third of the way through.  Weird in a bad way.  Yuck!
1,I just couldn't get into it. Slow moving.
1,When you remake a film, you should at least try to make a slightly different film and, if possible, make a better film. This is NOT what happened here. The filmmakers of the Omen (remake) took the 1976 version almost word for word, scene for scene, and added cell phones, 9/11 footage, slightly more grisly deaths, strange dream sequences, bad actors, and a lackluster soundtrack and released it to the viewing public expecting us to embrace it as a timely update to the original. The good news: this movie made a lot of money on it's opening week. The bad news: it's just a bad movie and there's not much in it that isn't in the original, only the original has better acting and the awesome Jerry Goldsmith soundtrack.
1,After watching the DVD movie with its color beginning to fade and to run into each other, we decided to purchase the Blu Ray movie to see if the color was better. The first thing we noticed was that there was no sound. While the pre-movie credits were shown, we should have heard music,especially that Irish tune they played during the Wayne-McLaglen fight thru the countryside. We also noticed that there was a pink border around the movie and that the movie itself was on the pinkish side. So, I do not recommend anyone purchasing this edition unless we just got a dud. The movie looked kinda pastel as a result.
1,didn't like this movie is thought that it was slow to get started
1,Just the usual spiritual Indian versus evil utility nonsense. It's OK for a time killer if you don't expect much of it.
1,I enjoyed Volver so I gave Broken Embraces a chance & rented it one night. It was such an awful, long, POS to sit through. Bad characters, bad writing, bad casting, just BAD.
1,Somebody had money and nothing to do with it but make a poorly written costume drama with ham acting and worse dialogue.
1,Unfortunately, when the product first came out Amazon didn't offer to sell the collectible egg, so I was forced to buy directly from Fox.  Even so, I wanted to share my opinions here to help those that are on the fence about buying it.		Don't!		The plastic egg is just awful, but even worse the cardboard case that holds the discs is shoddy and cheap.  Unless you like kitschy, plastic baubles, the egg is DEFINITELY not a collectible item.  It'd be far more worthwhile to buy the $99 version of the film at Amazon, then put the $50 towards a truly excellent polystone or resin piece over at Sideshow.		As a hardcore fan of the Alien films, you absolutely owe it to yourself to buy the Anthology, even if you have the Quadrilogy on DVD.  However, stick with the cheaper set and save yourself the buyer's remorse I have.
1,The Beatles are my favorite band of all time, but there is simply no excuse for this travesty. The spaghetti scene is awful and painful to watch, the bus ride singalong is horrid and quite simply the Fab Four look [bad] in every sense of the word. This movie is so bad, it almost ruins the music. Almost. This is one blot on an otherwise flawless legend. Avoid this at all costs.
1,Only ok. Not typical Sherlock Holmes. I was a little disappointed.
1,A detective (Ellen Barkin) is hunting a sadistic serial killer and discovers that the victims belonged to an underground sex club. She enlists the help of a shady lady who helps her navigate this unknown world.		I want two hours of my life back. I struggled to stay awake during this convoluted story which is marred by bad acting, bad dialogue, and is essentially a pretty bad and predictable movie. Unless you're a Peta Wilson fan (there is plenty of her on display), this is definitely a must miss.		 TJ Vest, August 2008
1,20th century fox should have transferred this movie in widescreen therefor it sucks , I sold the blasted movie .
1,The only outstanding thing about AVH is the striking cover art.	You see  it, knowing it'll probably look nothing like the movie monster, but still it does look creepy and horrible. I brought this DVD which contained 3 other Grade-Z abominations, (notably "MONSTER" which actually calls itself a monster monster--and the darned thing is NEVER shown!) for $5 in the Wal-Mart bargain bin.	But getting back to this horrendous mess, it literally looks like a bunch of amateurs got together--with maybe ten cents for their budget--hired a former Grade Z actor named William Katt (sigh, he DID make a movie called "Carrie" back in the good ole days)and stole the Alien concept and naturally sold it to the Sy Fy Channel which shows anything it can just so it doesn't cost more than ten cents.	I'm thinking of throwing a Most Horrible Horror Movie Ever Made festival this summer and will entertain my guests with truly horrible abominations that parade under such provocative titles like "AVH," "Monster," "Living Animals," "Wicked Little Thing," "Jennifer," "Pelts," "The Strangers," "Them" (the French dud, not the one about giant ants)"Rest Stop," "Lake Placid 2," "The Happening," "The Day the Earth Stood Stll (the 2008 version) and anything produced by Asylum Productions. You've been forwarned!
1,I watched about 40 mins of this depressing film and could not discover the merit of continuing. I felt the concept was terribly overdramatized and the premis of the movie was simply taking advantage of a truly horrible reality of war and aftermath. I could not recommend.
1,I thought the acting by Denzel Washington and John Goodman was great, as usual, and Don Cheadle was AWESOME, as usual, but the movies message was mixed and unclear to me.  I found myself wondering exactly what it was they were trying to say.  The movie was, I thought, in itself almost a contradiction?
1,didn't like it
1,If I had been in the audience at this performance I would have booed from the very beginning and throughout this horrible production. The singing was OK, the recits too slow and ponderous and WHAT was going on in the pit with all those pauses that added beats to pieces?	The Eros dancer was unnecessary; the Count wa a simpering idiot and I couldn't decide if he was sweating or had allergies or a nose bleed. Bartolo in a wheel chair? COME ON! It became about picking up papers and how he would get back in the chair! The "non piu andrai" was the worst travesty. I'm sorry the Salzburg audience had to be subjected to this at those prices. I will have a great deal of trouble watching the rest and  THANK GOD I didn't buy it!
1,If "A View to a Kill" is consider the worst Bond film, this turkey call "Moonraker" has to be viewed as the silliest Bond film of all times. James Bond in Space? Why oh why?		The movie is filled with problems. Roger Moore sleepwalks his way in his performance. Lois Chiles (Dr. Holly Goodhead) is one of the dullest Bond girls of all times. Michael Lonsdale (Drax) is a brilliant actor, but in this movie he appears bored. The storyline of Richard Kiel (Jaws) finding a girlfriend was so corny I could not believe it. And the space fight scene at the end was hilarious in the worst way. Despite this, this movie was a HUGE success (thanks to the return of the character Jaws and the success of Star Wars, which this film ripped off) and is considered the quintessential Bond film. However, most hardcore Bond fans (like myself) consider this film a joke, especially with Bond and Goodhead making love mid-air in space. Yes, its that silly. Watch for a good laugh!
1,dumb
1,This could've almost been 3 stars if it wasn't for the laziness of the script. It was a "Cheesy but Funny" concept that could've almost work for me; lots of blood, lots of action and suspense, interesting cast...But the way the script was written made some of the scenes a bit illogical. Now i know what you must be thinking : A movie where a man with a chainsaw is dressed as a bunny is not very logic anyway. That's true. But they could've at least made it a funny ride for the viewers.....		The main problem is the lack of decision and initiative from the characters. The opening scene on the road for example, where the main cast is being followed and harassed by the bunny man in his truck is way too long....they don't know what to do! they all look so desperate but no one speaks, no one has an idea or a solution ! They stop the car because they're too scared of being followed and bump in but then: Nothing! They're all freaking out in the car on the side of the road for what seems like an hour, not knowing what to do! Again, no initiative, no ideas, not even a cell phone....Nothing!		The movie does get a little better after the first 30 min....Once they finally realise they're being chased by a freak with a chainsaw dressed  as a bunny things do get a little more interesting and funnier but then again, the lack of initiative from the cast remains a little annoying sometimes. I mean c'mon, you guys are like 5 healthy individuals and this freak is alone, AND dressed as a rabbit...lol......At least we get a few interesting bloody scenes and some action (after the first 30 min of course....) The guy playing the bunny is good, he's a funny freak. The cinematography is also very good, nice picture quality.		A few minor changes would've made this film another hit in the "Best worst movie ever" tradition. I still had a good time watching it, but I'm aware those type of movies are not for everyone. Give it a try if you want to have some good laughs with your friends but don't expect to be blown away....		NOW RUN!!!!!
1,One has to wonder what the execs at Warner Brothers were thinking when they decided on this film to be the first Bollywood movie released in the U.S. by a major American studio. Perhaps their flawed logic was this: Americans like kung fu movies, so let's use kung fu to introduce them to another kind of Asian film. But if you want Americans to get acquainted with Bollywood, then show them a Bollywood movie, with all its distinct and wonderful characteristics, not a kung fu movie in Hindi with Indian actors (and a bad kung fu movie at that). The story follows dimwit Sidhu (played by Akshay Kumar), a vegetable-chopper from the Chandni Chowk neighborhood of Delhi, who goes to China to fulfill his destiny as the reincarnation of an ancient Chinese warrior. He encounters twins--one good, one evil (both played by Deepika Padukone)--and learns martial arts so he can vanquish a villain who's terrorizing a village. This ridiculous hybrid flopped at the box office for good reason. - The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Bollywood-Ticket/dp/B002Q0WPWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Bollywood Ticket</a>)
1,For $7.99 per month, you can watch the entire serieis on Netflix instead of spening $2 per episode with Amazon.		If each season has 20 episodes, that costs more than buying the entire season on DVD.		Your decision.
1,I cant believe anyone would give this movie 3 or more stars. Have any of you seen the first few hellraiser movies? Are you kidding me? This movie is like watching paint dry. This movie also sets a new records for the least amount of times you will see pinhead in any hellraiser movie! This is an insult to all the movies before it, even worse than the last couple stinkers they made (not that those were good either).		Verdict: Generic blood, bad acting, low budget, horrid plot, lack of gore, lack of horror, slow movie. The movie couldn't be more appropriately titled "Deader" because the series was already dead with the last couple movie releases. What happened to this series? Hellraiser movies used to be one of the best horror movies you could get. Now they are less than nothing. RIP pinhead
1,Why do so many movies advertise previews that are not really like the movie at all? I was disappointed.
1,Fabian socialism propaganda for children. It was insane in its core, promoting a tried and failed classic "overthrow religion and your parents and create your own order," captured like a page out of some socialist book on how to educate young to hate their parents. The gist was captured clearest in an eloquent George Clooney speech at the very end, but the entire movie had been leading towards that: "Its not hard to tear down a big evil building telling people that the world is going to end, but it is hard to figure out what to build in its place."  Yes, directed entirely toward children. Nauseating, and sadly most people haven't a clue that it is truly destructive..
1,While I tried to like this film, I'm in agreement with those reviewers who didn't like it. It's tedious to sit and wait for something to happen. The supposed scares were lame, at best. I can't be as harsh on this film, as I have been on others, as it DID try to lend suspense to the proceedings, but it never gave anything that one would expect, by reading the back of the DVD case. There are other low budget horror films that deliver a whole lot more for the money.		In defense of this film however, "The 8th Plague was a notch better than "Monster" (no, not the one with Charlize Theron, the other one, the one with tentacles on the DVD box).

1,I enjoyed the series season 1 and 2 after that season 3 and 4 stunk way too politically correct if I want to get preached to I will go to church on Sunday
1,Like other reviewers, I had to stop the tape after the first couple of sceens. I couldn't stand to watch it to the end.	Why would a girl carry on a conversation over the telephone with a known killer, instead of hanging up and call the police ? Who runs around town randomly killing people while wearing a stupid mask and a black cape ? The killer is a skinny little teenager, and he/she is able to overpower so many victims !!!!???	Buy the first Final Destination instead of this trash, Scream.
1,Don't waste your time on this one, terrible story line lousy acting kind of looks like it was done by a group of teenagers putting together a movie......
1,Throwbacks to bygone eras are nothing new in Hollywood, and for the past few years, it seems the 1980s have been the decade of choice to reference and mimic, with '80s themes appearing in both live action and animated fare. Enter The Smurfs, based on those lovable little blue creatures who kept children entertained for years on Saturday mornings. In this film adaptation, a handful of Smurfs are chased through a portal by the evil wizard Gargamel, only to end up in the real world of Manhattan. There, they befriend a sympathetic couple who help them find a way back home. I found almost nothing to like about the movie, which makes sense on some level: The Smurfs was clearly crafted to appeal to the lowest common denominator, and by "lowest" I mean "shortest"... you know, kids. With broad, slapsticky humor and "Smurf"-heavy dialogue, this movie probably won't do anything for you if you're over the age of 5, but if you want your little ones to learn in the simplest way what "Greedy" and "Vain" mean, you could possibly do worse.
1,Clearly this is not Lee Marvin's most memorable role. After robbing an armed vehicle using a bazooka, wearing a suit with a red carnation, Jimmy Cobb (Lee Marvin) hides out in a barn at a farmhouse owned by oversexed siblings who abuse their help. He ditches the money in the wheat field, but it is quickly removed by a boy who enjoys whiskey, cigarettes, and the local cat house where his aunt works. Everyone is after the money they think is buried in the field.		The film has lost something over time. My bad transferred to DVD copy made watching a film that lacked some entertainment value more difficult. The film claims it was made in 1984, but it has the feel of a 1970's sex comedy. Even Lee Marvin couldn't save this film.		Parental Guide: F-bomb, N-word, sex, nudity, sex talk.
1,Pure s***. Y'ever watch a movie and see the twist at the end coming and wonder, "why?", all the while realizing that the author probably put the twist in to try and make a complete pig of a movie 'unique' enough to gain financial backing? This is that movie. The opening murder is grotesque and gruesome enough to qualify as "horror"-grade schlock. Pullman's had enough chances. I'm done with him.		If you insist, rent this dog first; you'll probably agree it's not worth owning and thereby save yourself a few dollars. You can't have your time back, though.
1,They MUST have paid people to leave positive reviews of this film. It's the only explanation.		Matt Doherty (the guy was glasses) is SUCH a bad actor. There were several times that I laughed out loud and his over acting and preposterous antics. I don't understand why the director didn't solve the issue. In particular his "reaction acting" was truly awful. The moans, groans, and slamming his fists on his thighs. No one does that! Especially not when they're scared.		Anyway, the script was just okay. It was a bit cookie cutter, and it's too close to Grave Encounters not to point out the vast superiority of that movie over this one.		I guess if you've seen Grave Encounters, it's a rainy day so you can't go outside, and you've blown through everything in your Netflix queue, go ahead and give this a go. Otherwise, skip it.
1,Wonderful ensemble, but sex gets in the way of the story line. Writers can use a better mix of comedy and drama.  Don't assign one personality type to just one actor,  we all change sometime doing the same day.  Just being naked Is porn, The possibility of sex  is more alluring. Great art always tells the story first.
1,Forget it
1,I thought I'd seen THE WORST from Kevin Costner with Waterworld, The Postman and the like... but this one takes it to a whole new level of BAD. Not a comedy, not an action movie, predictable, glitched... this guy either does not need any money or he does need it desperately! I cannot understand how people compare The French Connection or The Professional to this failure. What a waste of money renting this one, Amazon should have a MINUS star rating to rate some of this stuff.
1,Though the reviewers here seem to have a basically high opinion of the film, I found myself bothered by a lot of things.  Mainly the male POV prevalent throughout that two female characters, presumably both intelligent and attractive, would bother wasting themselves on someone who doesn't deserve their time of day:  namely two-timing boyfriend Gerry, who is living with Paltrow's "Helen" while she supports him totally as he is supposedly writing a novel.  Right there, immediately the film came to a grinding halt for me.  I already have to think both Helen and the pre-Helen girlfriend who is back in Gerry's life are self-destructive, low self-esteem types who will take any man on a platter that is given up to them:  This Gerry isn't attractive, either physically or emotionally, to explain away his appeal to these women.  And without some blinding charismatic trait of Gerry's to make this plot seem feasible, this means the screenwriter just has a low opinion of females in general.  Or the male lead was badly cast.  Probably a combination of the two.		And Helen's second romantic prospect isn't that great at final glance either, as it turns out a very important piece of information about him isn't revealed to Helen until near the end of the film, meaning though we're meant to assume he's her knight in shining armor (she needs rescuing from Gerry, at least the screenwriter gives us that) he can be kind of casual in the honesty department.		And Gerry?  In the dual-plot he manages to make both his official and unofficial girlfriends pregnant, meaning he's not likely to be that responsible when it comes to you-know-what.  So he's stupid on top of everything else.		My final dissatisfaction with the film is a general disgust with a certain cliche used in films, that the rebound romance is really the romance you've been waiting for.  The cliche evolved probably to give broken-hearted audience members hope for something better, but in real life, a rebound romance is a needful one, and a part of the grieving/separation process, but a rebound romance that turns to an offical partnership, such as marriage, is nearly always doomed to failure.  But here, in this film, in whichever reality, we're seeing Helen necessarily getting her wake up call and ditching Gerry only to fall immediately into a love affair with James, the not-as-honest-and-sweet-as-we-want-to-think-he-is.  But it's understood in Hollywood parlance that Helen and James will live happily-ever-after - because they were fated, you know?		For a comedy there were very few laughs, in fact I don't remember any.  So perhaps this film is mistakenly labelled as such.  Otherwise, for nitpickers, Paltrow definitely looks better as a sophisticated blonde than as a casual brunette, and there seems to be an extreme shortage of goodlooking men in England.  We really needed Jude Law in this one in order to make it work.  In fact, the male casting could have been Daniel Craig and Jude Law - either man in either part - and it would have worked a lot better, along with a touchup to the script.		Instead of a film, this would have been better as a single episode of a television one hour anthology series.  Because in movie length, it is tiresome.
1,Requires whatever the movie equivalent of Cliff Notes is.
1,I only watched a few minutes of this movie. The language was vulgar.
1,MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS:		I really enjoyed the original Men in Black movie, because it was fresh at the time. We got to discover the Men in Black organization along with the future Agent J.		Unfortunately, this sequel really doesn't have anything new to offer. The memory eraser is used over and over again. The aliens among us are still oddball bizarre looking creatures. The only part that was funny was the Andy Warhol character, which only older adults will understand as humorous.		Josh Brolin as the young Agent K was somewhat interesting, but if you've seen the first two, you may find this sequel boring.
1,Cheesy... slow and corny.  It did have a couple of cute parts, but the few cute parts of the movie, did not make it worth watching.
1,So many reviewers so far point out that 'The Singing Detective' is inferior to the 1986 TV mini-series starring Michael Gambon.  On the other hand, there are some who defend this newer Robert Downey Jr. version on the ground that it has its own charms, mostly about its quirky nature.  I happened to be interested in the film after seeing the cast without knowing the background history of the film including all about Dennis Potter.  Now I've seen it, and I was intrigued with the unique world at first, but sorry, that didn't last very long.		Actually, I'm impressed with certain things.  No matter what people say, Robert Downey Jr. is a fantastic actor, and he shows it as Dan Dark in a hospital bed.  His pains hiding behind his arrogance can be easily felt thanks to his powerful acting and good make-up jobs.  I have nothing against the other cast which is also impressive -- from reliable Robin Wright Penn to Mel Gibson with a bald wig on his head.  Even Katie Holmes is good, but perhaps the truth is, she can be good if she wants to.		But even if you have not seen the original TV like me, you would soon realize the defects of the film.  Im short it needs more time.  So many characters are made to appear in Dark's two worlds, reality and fantasy, that they are all reduced to insignificant cyphers.  Alfre Woodard appears fleetingly, and is gone.  Adrian Brody and Jon Polito appear as Hoods, and ... what did they do?  Nothing that I can remember.  Jeremy Northam?  Where is he?		But more fundamental trouble is the relation between Dark and the doctor played by Gibson.  For all Gibson's good acting as oddball Dr. Gibbon, Dark's psychological process to find the true problem about his over-aggressive mind through his ficional noir world looks too contrived here, and is given too short time to convince us.  Even the musical sections, though themselves good, look mercilessly cut short.  Director Keith Gordon does his best, but if you see too short musical parts (Danny and the Juniors' hit 'At the Hop' for example) it is obvious that the film's budget was limited.		I'm not telling you 'The Singing Detective' is a bad film.  Rather, it is an example showing that with a wiser decision of the filmmakers, this could have been much better.  Why not longer version instead of just 110 minutes?  But perhaps, like Billy Bob Thornton's 'All the Pretty Horses,' the exectives would not allow that.
1,I knew we were in for something bad with "Phantom Menace" when you look at what he did to the original trilogy a short time earlier.  Listen folks, all you need to know is this:  George Lucas has NO CONCEPT of what makes a movie good.  All he cares about is filling the screen with unneeded special effects, many of which are hard to look at because they stand out so much.  I will not comment on "Jar-Jar" specifically because it's no more ridiculous than the hundreds of other things in this movie.  Save you money.  If you want to buy your kids a nice "kids movie" I'd suggest "Toy Story(1 or 2)" or "Shrek".  Heck, I've seen Saturday morning cartoons that had tighter stories than "Phantom Menace".  (...)  I have to assume that "Star Wars" was a lucky accident for you.  Here's a tip for you:  look into making the next "Final Fantasy" instead.  (...)
1,weird movie, didn't like it. I like the actors, but not the movie.
1,It was very depressing to me.  WF is not supposed to be downtrodden.
1,I was disappointed in this movie.  I expected more comedy.  Just not as funny not that they are older now.
1,The one star reviews are way better than the movie!
1,Terrible Feminist agenda driven mis-write of history.. All to show just how important and intellectual women were then. Adams wife is portrayed as the powerhouse Brain behind all major decisions in early America... What an injustice to all those powerful men and especially John Adams. A PURE WASTE OF YOUR TIME!
1,I have enjoyed all series of this show until this one.  Every single episode revolved around religious fanatics.  As fanatical as the characters in these episodes were about different religions, the writers were as fanatical in their contempt for people of faith... any faith.  It's become cliche!.	I loved Midsomer Murders and looked forward to every season, but this is the last I will purchase.
1,I watched it about half way through which was enough time to figure out the simple plot.  The actors never evolved from their initial introduction. John Cusack never fit the bill as a serial killer he would have played a child molester part better and Nicolas Cage is still too autocratic.
1,Tarantino has definitely run out of steam. But then again, I always question if he ever had steam. Though this movie is visually stunning, the storyline is so-so and uninspired, the use of the "N" word every five seconds is only done for shock value. The music is taken from classic movies that everyone should be watching instead of this. The use of Jim Croce's "I've Got A Name" is hilariously and unintentionally comical and reminiscent of a road/buddy movie. The lynch mob "bag" scene where they portray them as bumbling buffoons, while deserved, is at best, hokey and eye-roll inducing. In other words, this movie doesn't have an original idea and is totally predictable. But that's not too surprising coming from a director who's movie structure is to take every clich from B-movie classics and passing it as his own to movie-goers who's knowledge goes no further than Top Ten movies.

1,suck
1,Boring and shallow
1,I thought the acting was particularly flat. I don't know what's going on with Lana only that perhaps her contract requries her to still be on the show. Why is lex out of the picture - is he pregnant or something? I've not been this dissapointed in what was a solid creative show than now. Please tell me this is a guest director, or some sort of spoof that will be somehow undone by a time machine or something much more plausable than the action in the past two episodes.		It hurts, like watching your child fail only you can't be there in any way to make it better other than resign and go watch Friends reruns.
1,This review is for the Canadian edition of this Blu-ray.  First off, it's the theatrical version so the Director's Cut isn't included.  I mean, the director's cut doesn't make the movie excellent or anything, but it is an improvement.  The American version is now available and I wish I had waited.  The premise was a good one:  vampires unearth Dracula, the first of their kind, in an attempt to become daywalkers and defeat Blade.  They manage to get Blade on the run and he's forced to team up with a group of resistance fighters.  This new team includes some great talent like Patton Oswald, Jessica Biel, and Ryan Reynolds.  Reportedly Wesley Snipes didn't like that he had to share screen time with a scene stealer like Ryan and you can really tell in their scenes together.  Parker Posey does a fine job of chewing scenary as one of the principal villians.  You're more likely to roll you eyes during allot of the action sequences and dialogue than be thrilled or entertained.  Can't recommend unless you're a die hard Blade fan and have to complete your collection.  If you do though, pick up the American version.
1,i gave it a one only because i couldn't give it a 0. the cinematography was so bad, the acting even worse, mix that with no plot and you have this movie.
1,I was only able to watch the first 10-15 minutes. I couldn't take any more. Stopped playback and found something better to watch.
1,Movie was poorly executed. Story was intriguing but it was far too unbelievable.
1,Not very funny--mostly silly.
1,There is no story here. The dialogue is terrible. The film is confusing and silly from the word go. There are ludicrous time-fillers like Bale and Adams dancing around and Cooper and Adams dancing around. There are miserable Goodfellas-wannabe-style restaurant scenes and voiceovers that fall flat. Throw in some gratuitous sex, Amy Adams screaming bloody murder on the toilet for no apparent reason, Bradley Cooper at home in 250+ tiny foam curlers (Come on, people. There were permanents back then.), and an FBI agent still living with his mother who looks and talks more like a father and you have a very strange and truly awful movie.
1,Extremely bad interpretation of the south pre-civil war days. Accents were horrible as was the acting.	Maybe this film was a put-on?  Maybe I just didn't get it? I'll watch it again with that frame of mind.
1,This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. They apparently tried to make it "funny" by just adding more outrageous, totally stupid things. The whole plot idea, that he is a chronic liar to women, is pretty much a rip off of his character at the beginning of "50 First Dates" but much less funny and a lot more disgusting. In this he continues to lie after he meets a girl he really cares about and has the perfect opportunity to tell her the truth. Instead he continues to pile lie on top of lie, dragging his assistant and her two less than charming children into it, but I guess that was the only way the writers could think of to make the story continue so that they could make the movie. The shopping scene to get a makeover for Jennifer is a ripoff from "Pretty Woman" I noticed that they threw in Hawaii just to try to make it more interesting and that's another rip off of "50 First Dates" which was filmed there. I guess Sandler just wanted to go to Hawaii again. Well, he should have just taken a vacation there. I'm very surprised that Jennifer Anniston ever agreed to be in this totally classless movie. I can't imagine it ever sounded good even on paper.
1,Nintendo's ever popular LEGEND OF ZELDA videogame series could have made for an excellent cartoon/Anime series, but this '80s attempt is absolutely disastrous in every way imaginable.  The artwork reeks of Saturday morning cartoon fare, and the stories range from uninspired to totally inept ("The White Knight", in particular, where Zelda becomes inexplicably infatuated with some bland armored prince is especially dreadful).  Furthermore, the lead characters, Link and Zelda, are neither appealing nor interesting.  He's portrayed as a perverted doofus uttering a cringeworthy "Excuuuse me, Princess" while she is a shallow, bitchy heroine.  When one feels no empathy for either protagonist, you know something's wrong.  A continuous running gag happens between the pair where Link tries to steal a kiss from Zelda, only to have it never happen.  Even the characterization of the series' central villain, Ganon, is disappointing; in the games he was a figure of awesome, intimidating evil, but here he's a painfully monodimensional cartoon baddie with zero substance.  There are many other things wrong with this series as well:  the editing and the direction of a majority of the action sequences is very choppy, with lots of obvious errors.  It's almost as if the creators did not have a good knowledge of the characters or the enemies from the game.  The only thing this series does right is in retaining some classic NES sound effects and familiar musical scores, but otherwise, even diehard ZELDA fans are likely to cringe at the overall results of this travesty.
1,I was looking for something new and romantic to watch. I forced my self to watch the whole thing to see if it would improve. The actine was a bit stiff. The actress seemed to be straining to show emotions, like in the old 1960s soap operas, to the point of over acting. It did not come off as natural. No chemistry between the actors. The movie must have been made for younger teenagers. I was disappointed. It was not entirely horrible, but it did not keep my interest. I prefer B movies to this.
1,Since The Howling, it seems that this franchise has forever lost its way along with its impact.  Yet another subpar, stand alone non-sequel.  Yuck!		Ian, cursed with lycanthropy,  wanders into a small town and is only welcomed by a local minister and his underage daughter who really likes him.  During a date with this 17 year old, Ian bumps into a traveling carnival freak show run by a shady Brit named Harker (Bruce Payne; Warlock III: Armageddon, Highlander: Endgame), who seems to be some sort of warlock-vampire.  He is meant to be menacing, but I'm really not feeling it.  VILLAIN-FAIL!		This movie really drags.  A lot of effort is made to build up the characters, but I came to this carnival for a horror flick, not a drama--more Killer Klowns from Outer Space than Water for Elephants.  But a drama is more of what I got, and it is hardly carried by this D-list acting troupe.  HORROR-FAIL!		This werewolf turns out looking like a member of Twisted Sister during an overdose and shares too much I common with a bad horror vampire to be taken seriously.  He looks like a bearded, long-haired reaper from Blade II or one of those baggy-eyed ghoul-vampires in Subspecies or Dusk 'til Dawn.  Whatever the case, if this wasn't a werewolf movie I 'd probably need someone to explain to me what he was supposed to be.  This make-up is neither good nor creative.  Terrible transformation scene, terrible looking werewolf, awkward canine legs; WEREWOLF-FAIL!		Similarly bad is Harker's vampire form make-up, which looks like a blackish purple, hairless demon with a big skull and crazy claws; VAMPIRE-FAIL!  That's right. This werewolf movie was so bad that it managed to shoehorn a "vampire-fail" in with all the other awful.  This monster reminded me of the creeper from Jeepers Creepers crossed with Scott Speedman's half-lycan/half-vampire from Underworld.		Needless to say, there is no shortage of stupid in this movie.  But have no fear.  In the end, the freak show's alligator boy recites an incantation he learned from the warlock vampire to turn Ian into a werewolf so that he could defeat the warlock vampire (with a stake to the throat) so that he could live happily ever after with the local minister's underage daughter.		Huh!?!
1,Gross, violent, too graphic, and generally the type of movie I like,but not this one. Far fetched. Good cast.
1,This bloated, overlong epic marked the virtual end of multi-million dollar spectacular movies produced in the late fifties and early sixties.  Boasting the largest budget ever at the time, it also grossed the least amount of money for this sort of film (a mere $500K).  Its screenwriter, Philip Yordan, once told me that after this movie "the banks closed their doors whenever they saw Sam Bronston coming."  Despite its impressive cast, the film is downright dreary.  How did such a huge film on such a fascinating subject go so terribly wrong?  It's too bad, really, because I miss this kind of spectacle with thousands of "live" extras and fabulous, rousing music scores.
1,Meet The Spartans is a plesant enough diversion but is by no means a classic.		The saving grace was Kevin Sorbo,The man needs to do more comedy.		He is a natural and could easily pull off 1940's style slap stick comedy.
1,Boring film.  I've known lots of "Jolene"s, and a lot more interesting - there was nothing special about her; it was always just about her and what she wanted.  It's not anything I would spend almost 2 hours watching.  I fast-forwarded though it and it still took too long, because it was entirely predictable.
1,I got this with the intention of seeing the evolution of Native Americans in film.  Instead, I received a political "poor us" statement with very little cinema clips.  I only got 30 minutes through it before I turned it off.  Maybe the documentary showed more movie depictions and analysis later on, but I wasn't seeing much of it up to that point.		Don't get me wrong.  I know the Indian has been badly mistreated over the years, but I was not looking for a political film.  I love movies and just wanted to see the evolution of Native Peoples over the years depicted by Hollywood. I got a much different DVD than I wanted or was expecting. As long as you know what you're getting into and are happy with that, then you should enjoy this.  Otherwise, find some other resource for Indians in film.
1,If you're a nerd, or have ever been friends with one, you probably remember discussions concerning superhero or monster smackdowns. Superman vs. Mighty Mouse? Thor vs. The Hulk? King Kong vs. Jaws in ankle-deep water? Who would win? Well, one of those nerds - or several of them, from the look of the credits - wrote and directed a movie about just that.		In some ways, this is nothing new. Almost every monster ever created has been pitted against one of his famous counterparts: King Kong vs. Godzilla, Dracula vs. Frankenstein, Puppet Master vs. Demonic Toys, Godzilla vs. the Netherlands, and (believe it or not) Emmanuelle vs. Dracula. This sort of fantasy cockfigting is never a strong sign for either character, and "AVP" is no exception.		The main difference is that, while these other films are theatrical or TV cheapies, "AVP" is an A-budget movie. The production design, photography and effects work are well worthy of its predecessors. The problem, as you might imagine, lies in the story.		"AVP" is primarily a clone of the first "Alien", which means for the first forty minutes, we're introduced to characters WE KNOW are going to get eaten or torn to bits. While the original film has a group of great actors to help buttress the script and make for a compelling opening, the cast and dialogue of "AVP" are rather generic, making the assembly of this team fairly perfunctory. "Alien" knew this gathering of characters was unneccessary (as it was called "Alien" and not "Space Miners") and introduced them together on the ship to save time.		Things progress like a page torn from "Mad Libs": A team of ragtag Proper Nouns, including a Empowering Adjective woman, is drawn to a mysterious derelict Noun by an unexplained Other Noun. The set-up is closer to a blend of "The Thing" and "Armageddon", and soon we're wandering around more dark corridors with glow sticks and laser sights, knowing FULL WELL this time what they're going to encounter. Even though this film's primary audience is fans of the previous movies, it's paced as if none of this has ever happened before. The environments of "The Thing" and "Alien" were appropriately brutal to set a mood. The Antarctica of "AVP", though, seems more like a snowglobe, with flakes gently drifting about.		The derelict Noun this time is a deeply buried Aztec/Mayan/Vietnamese temple. As the team works its way inside, it discovers a sacrificial chamber, hiding the alien eggs and the Predator's laser weapons. It's not long before the trap is sprung, and most of the team is either incubating beasties, or separated from their companions, or both. The temple (courtesy of "The Cube") begins to shift and reconfigure itself every ten minutes, creating a maze that seems nearly impossible to solve.		Taking a page from "Chariots of the Gods", we discover that the Predator race came to earth (long before any of the other movies) to use this temple to breed Aliens on earth (long before any of the other movies). Young Predators would then come to hunt the Aliens in the temple every hundred years as a rite of passage ceremony. Considering how difficult the Aliens have been to kill in the past, this shifting maze comes across as a wrinkle for the video game tie-in. As formidable as the Predators are, it seems unlikely (between their maturity rate and the rite itself) that they would have survived long enough to create their own franchise.		This premise seems to be contrived primarily for the pupose of enabling the team to discover the plot through translation of hieroglyphs, rather than visual discovery. Not only is it unconvincing, it also guts the impact of an "Alien" sequel where the creatures threaten to infest Earth for the first time (I know "Alien Resurrection" brushed on this, but it wasn't the exectution of it that I was hoping for).		The titular battles between the Aliens and the Predators are enjoyable. Considering that this is presumably the main attraction, it's surprising how brief and choppy they are. There isn't a lot of logic to them - the acidic Alien blood seems to burn through some things immediately, and others not at all - but there's a little fun to be had.		Not to do anything the easy way, the Predators have also captured an Alien queen in the temple, periodically defrosting her when more eggs are needed. Of course, her drones release her at the end of act two (which I'm assuming also happens every hundered years). Act three then consists of the Empowering Adjective woman running around Antarctica in her tank top battling the Alien queen.		The most interesting element of the film is that it tries to do "Terminator 2" one better and make the lone surviving Predator a sympathetic team member. It mainly serves to make you wonder what the film might have been like if this had happened earlier, or if the Predators had simply taken the place of the human characters as the center of our sympathies.		So why did I watch this? Didn't I have a good idea of what I was in for? Sure. "AVP" is a Twinkie of a movie. You know they're not good for you, and that you might feel a little sick afterwards. But sometimes you just want a Twinkie.
1,Although true to Sherlock Holmes story it moved rather slowly.
1,Home Run Showdown displays competent acting, direction and cinematography. It also has a suitable soundtrack, but its lack of focus and originality make it insubstantial. Thematically, its scattershot approach keeps any lesson from being effectively driven home. It even strangely tries to squeeze in a political message about immigration. It is often entertaining but ephemeral. I think younger viewers will enjoy it, but it doesnt have enough for other members of the family. Some parents will want to pass because of some occasional vulgarities.
1,The Drake Mining Company is set to make a fortune with discovery of isotope L6 while deep cavern mining. The problem with L6 is that it is explosive with water and seeks out wet items such as people, even people on top of a lake of water...just saying. Only Keven Sorbo, now a seismologist, can save Nevada...or wherever.		This is a formula disaster film, one of the lesser quality and lesser known films of  prolific writer Jim Wynorski. It barely keeps you engaged.
1,Saw the DVD box, turned it over and saw Asylum, promptly put the box face down. This company's use of Amazon to write fake glowing reviews of their "products" is sad. My 1 star rating is an attempt to lower the overall rating to help fight these scammers.
1,Although this film has reasonably good production values, cinematography, and music, it lacked chemistry between the characters. There seemed to be no real feelings evident in the relationship. The viewer is given no background, just quick, almost wordless introductions to the characters, and the story. We are forced to guess at what each character represents. The story lacked real depth and meaning.		I understand it's a pretty film. Good looking leading characters and a charismatic child are not nearly enough to sustain this film. I long for the days of Latter Days and Big Eden. Recent entries such as E-Cupid have more entertaining content than this.
1,VEI told me that these are Censored USA versions and not the uncensored Canadian versions
1,Since this movie claims that it is Dawn of the Dead's sequel, I will make the assumption that this film needs to be compared to Dawn of the Dead.		There are many positives to Zombie when comparing to Dawn of the Dead. For example, zombies look more like the actual walking dead, rather than the face painted zombies of Dawn. Not only do the zombies look real, but also many of the graphic scenes were gruesome and horrifying. The Dr's wife demise was probably one of the most horrific scenes in movie history.		That is where the good stuff ends, unfortunately. Just because the movie has horrifying, gruesome death scenes, doesn't mean it'll become an automatic hit with zombie fans. The thing that made Dawn of the Dead so good is the fact that there was a story to bind it all together. Zombie had no such story, although a good base was in place. The story just fell apart at the end. Not only that, it got super ridiculous at the end. I thought the final stand would have been a good fight. Instead, it turned out to be that six shooters and shotguns can shoot seemingly infinite bullets, and gas filled bottles seems to come in infinite quantities as well. Just to top it all, the movie states that New York is under a huge epidemic where zombies take over the city. When they show the scene, daily life is still happening all around with cars going back and fort and I saw what appeared to be a man walking normally on the bridge that's populate by zombies. Seems more like the movie makers just ran out of cash to close the bridge, so they just recorded right in the middle of rush hour.		The only reason I gave this movie one star is because of one thing: shark versus zombie. Just when you thought the movie couldn't get anymore ridiculous, what happens? A naked person underwater running from a shark, only to be saved by a zombie who happens to attack the shark in an attempt to eat it.		After viewing the film, I immediately, read immediately, returned the movie. It was so gross and ridiculous, I laughed at myself in even thinking there was something remotely better than Romero's film.
1,This is one of these poor quality picture transfers to DVD.  For excellent quality purchase the European Region 2 version.
1,This is a wretched sitcom.  It wasn't very good when it was made, and the production troubles it had are well documented.  As we know, this was Margaret Cho's first (and, to date, only) sitcom, and ABC tinkered with it to the point that it sent Margaret into a tailspin personally.  They forced her to lose weight (which resulted in kidney failure), and they also hired an "Asian consultant", as the audience didn't believe Margaret's character was Asian enough.  After the show was cancelled, Margaret spiralled down into drugs, booze, and anonymous sex (by her own admission).  Her concert film, I'm the One that I Want, details what happened to her in sometimes painful detail.  The actual show is garbage, but, perhaps, there is a silver lining to this show being released on DVD.  If they put this manure out, they'll put anything out, and if there's a really obscure film you love, it may someday come out on DVD.
1,P. D. James is Britain's "Queen of Crime," arguably the best of England's crime writers. She is able to write a good mystery that is a fine novel. Yet, this film is, in my opinion, not good.		 The film is 310 minutes long. It is broken into six segments, and was apparently shown on British TV in six installments, perhaps a week apart. The film is too drawn out. It could have been done better in two or at most two and a half hours. It has so many characters that add so many red herrings that the film begins to look like an overripe fish soup and not an exciting drama. Adam Dalgliesh, James' usual Scotland Yard detective, is on holiday in a village and doesn't have the key role in the investigation. He moves about from time to time and talks to people. This and the many unnecessary events and discussions weaken interest in the tale and add confusion.		 A number of women are killed in mysterious ways in the village by a man the villagers call "the whistler." An atomic power plant's computer is invaded by a virus. The director of the plant is having an affair with one of his employees as well as another woman. He doesn't know who is sabotaging his computer system or why. The woman he is having an affair with is murdered, seemingly by the whistler. Is this a single case, two, three, or more? The local police interview more than half a dozen suspects and several ask others to lie about their whereabouts during the murder.
1,THE ONLY MONSTERS IN MONSTERS BALL ARE THE DEPRESSED CHARACTERS. THE STORY SEEMS TO BE GOING IN A # OF DIRECTIONS, AND ENDS UP NO WHERE. HALLE BARRY'S PERFORMANCE IS GREAT, ALTHOUGH BETTER SUITED FOR A SUPPORTING OSCAR. HER PART WAS NOT BIG ENOUGH FOR AN OSCAR IN A LEADING ROLE. I CAN NOT RECOMMEND MONSTERS BALL ON BERRY'S GOOD WORK ALONE, AND BELIEVE ME IT'S THE ONLY HIGHLIGHT HERE. IT IS BEYOND ME HOW THIS DEPRESSING FILM ENDED UP ON SO MANY CRITIC'S TOP 10 LISTS.
1,horrible movie..bad acting, bad story line, some ok special effects which was a waste...it seems like the director was a high schooler..probably...
1,Perhaps I am biased in that I wish Virginia Woolf was still alive so I could run her over in my car.  Twice.  But aside from the fact that this film was based on that repulsive stain on literature that is Woolf, it was still horrendous.  All the characters are so uninteresting that you want them to die within the first 10 minutes just so something exciting will happen.  Kidman looks likes she's suffering severe constipation for most of the film, although that may just be the fact that she's playing such a ridiculously boring character that she has no choice but to try and add some personality.  If you have the choice between seeing this film or running face first into a wall, pucker up and plant a big one on that slab of concrete, because your head will hurt less than sitting through this crapfest.  I hate Virginia Woolf.
1,I'm surprised this film only has one "one star rating", maybe the cast and crew submitted these reviews.  The film was dull and predictable, I'd rather spend my hour and change starring outside my window and counting atoms within raindrops.  Tyler Perry's knows what his core audience wants and they eat it up everytime and he skips to his accountant's office.  I'm mildly entertained by some of his films but this one was a complete waste of my time as the entire premise of the film was weak.
1,I couldn't even finish watching this movie! It is dubbed in english&  not very well! Don't buy unless u like wasting money!
1,First I'd like to say any that have read some of my reviews knows I often watch low budget movies as well as the big studio movies.  This movie is low budget, but unfortunately they did not care about doing the best with what they had.  Budget does not restrict you from making special effects look realistic.  You can take shots from angles and distance to cover up wiring and lights, but they did not.  You can make a dragon look like a dragon and not a cross between a T Rex and a dog, but they did not.  The sets and costumes are decent and the acting is tolerable, it's to bad they didn't come through on the fight scenes and other F/X.
1,season 5 is SO disappointing. i watched because i was invested in the past 4 seasons which were brilliant.  i had to know what happened to Patty.  only worth it to me because i do not have cable.
1,Decent Hallmark type movie for younger teens falls short with adults. Lauren Holly is not looking her best here & they have her acting like an almost deranged simpleton, which is really sad, but awful to watch. The best actor in the movie has a bit part & is hardly noteworthy so consider this just another fluff movie .
1,I have been considering buying The Jeffersons Season 1 since i have Seasons 2-6. Sony Release Season 7 & 8 already. If not, i will be selling off ALL of my remaining The Jeffersons dvds. I will NOT keep them if the show will NEVER be finished.
1,Monotone the whole movie... they got the future wrong for 2019. Why do so many people like this movie???
1,A group of sorority girls head up to a ranch on Grizzly Cove to compete in a contest. Holly (Casey Fitzgerald) the daughter of a police officer is killed in the first scene.  An over aggressive police officer on probation is sent up to keep on eye on Holly. The girls competing are introduced grindhouse style and they are some tough party animals. As the body count starts, this turns into a who done it, with a twist at every turn.		I liked the opening and first part of the film. As the film progressed, the slasher aspect was low budget with no great kill scenes. It was if they combined a grindhouse with a made for TV film forgetting their target audience. If you are going to title a film "Sorority Party Massacre" you need to have a sorority party and some decent massacring. This fell short.		Parental Guide: F-bomb. Minor girl/girl action. Brief nudity.
1,S.W.A.T. is a typical summer action movie - several big set pieces with little coherent plot or character development.  As such, it succeeds fairly well.  Samuel L. Jackson stars as the team head, Sgt. Hondo, who returns to the force to help burnish the tarnished image of the Los Angeles S.W.A.T.  He assembles a team of misfits, including Colin Farrell and Michelle Rodriquez, and LL Cool J.  The team trains and is thrown into the field just as an international crime figure (Olivier Martinez) is captured in LA and is to be transported to a remote dessert prison.  This transport mission is complicated greatly when the fugitive offers $100 million to anyone who can free him.	The movie features a few good action scenes, including a Lear jet trying to take off from a bridge, and the dialogue includes a few funny jokes.  However, S.W.A.T. never gains much traction, largely because of the generic characters and plot.  TV director Clark Johnson (The Shield, Third Watch) helms, and his apparent lack of vision is a major debit.  With such a great cast, a good basic plot idea, and a large budget, S.W.A.T. should have been fantastic, but it ends up being a disappointment that will likely be forgotten quickly.	Extras: A potentially fun commentary track with the director and cast (sans Colin Farrel) goes nowhere as the director obviously recorded his commentary separately from the cast.  The result is a disjointed and joyless commentary track.
1,Do What?  One of the funniest of Mark Twain's stories is one wherein he creates a complicated plot and then can't figure out how to resolve it. So, he simply kills off everybody in the story.	  This movie pretends to greatness but doesn't follow through.  Worse than that, the premise plot doesn't get resolved at all.  Pretty pictures but what a waste of time.
1,For making this OOP not even 6 months on the shelf. No word on a re-release with actual episodes in order. If only this series was in the hands of a competent company.
1,The director of " Wendigo," Larry Fessenden, claims in a short interview on the DVD that he first learned of this supernatural monster from a teacher during his days in elementary school. Intrigued by the idea, and apparently inspired by it as well, Fessenden decided to direct a film utilizing the eerie idea of a half man, half beast creature roaming through the snow covered forests of the Catskills. The director is seemingly unaware that the Wendigo was arguably one of Algernon Blackwood's most effective spook stories. This British author set his tale in the wilds of Canada towards the end of the nineteenth century where a hunting expedition undergoes a horrific encounter with the bloodthirsty Indian legend. The yarn is creepy to the nth degree, one of the best horror stories I have ever read. Sadly, Fessenden's take on the Wendigo legend fails to live up to the high standards set by author Blackwood. What a shame, too, because a movie incorporating even a tenth of the atmosphere found in the written version would have been a worthy endeavor indeed. Oh well, cinematic adaptations of H.P. Lovecraft stories rarely entertain either. Perhaps someday someone will do justice to the Wendigo legend--oh, I forgot! Someone did accomplish just such a feat. Its called "Ravenous."	"Wendigo," Fessenden's version anyway, introduces us to Kim, George, and their son Miles. This is a family with problems, but we do not learn about them until well into the movie. We first see this big city trio driving into the Catskills in order to spend some time at the country house of a family friend. Both parents have stressful jobs: Kim is a psychiatrist and George is some sort of graphic artist. The son has his own problems, mainly a tentative relationship with his "too busy to spend time with him" father. The trip, therefore, will provide a chance for the family to reconnect. Problems emerge almost immediately when the car hits a deer on the road a few miles away from their destination. It soon becomes apparent that some local hunters were tracking the animal up until the time George mashed it to bits. The hunters are understandably upset about this unfortunate incident, especially Otis, one of the more obnoxious members of the group. George and Otis get into it over the dead animal, as does Kim when she screams and shouts about these guys having guns so close to her precious little son. Despite the hard feelings, the locals help pull George's car, which went into the ditch due to the deer, up onto the road.	The weirdness continues once the three reach the house. Otis cruises by on the road near the house, glancing ominously up at the building before roaring off. An even more sinister incident happens when George and Kim notice someone fired a bullet through the window. It is clear Otis has a problem with these outsiders, a problem soon exacerbated by the bickering between Kim and George about their son and the father's inability to step back from his career. Still, the movie soldiers onward. A trip into town results in a peculiar encounter between Miles and a local Indian who tells the boy about the Wendigo legend and then gives him a figurine of the beast. Funny thing is, nobody knows anything about an old Indian in town. It seems that Miles experienced a supernatural incident. Meanwhile, more bullet holes in the house have just about worked Kim's last nerve to a frazzle. The police arrive on the scene too late to prevent a genuine tragedy from taking place. The movie concludes with a weeping Kim and a shocked Miles wondering just went wrong. Not surprisingly, the look on my face probably resembled Miles's visage to some extent, as I too wondered what had just taken place.	Deviating significantly from Algernon Blackwood's story constitutes the gravest error of Fessenden's "Wendigo." I would have preferred a shot by shot version of the story than yet another movie about a family in crisis expressed against the backdrop of a supernatural event. So what if Kim and George have numerous problems? What else is new? Everybody has difficulties within the family. The emphasis on a dysfunctional family might have been enough to save the movie if the characters were interesting. They are not: Kim is shrill and nagging, Miles distant and uncommunicative, and the problems I had with George are too numerous to list here. Suffice it to say he is a massive jerk with a bad haircut. When he and his wife started in on the hunters, my sympathies went to the locals. Here's an abrasive pair of big city know it alls trying to tell people what to do. They should have left them in the ditch. The good points of the film, namely the beautiful Clarkson, the occasionally oppressive mood, an interesting soundtrack, and a bit of violence are not enough to make this a film worthwhile. In fact, "Wendigo" reminded me of another indie clunker I saw recently called "Kaaterskill Falls." This is not a good thing.	The Wendigo does make an appearance towards the end of the film, but it is a slightly cheesy effect tricked up with fast camera cuts to hide the inherent flaws of the monster. Extras on the DVD include an interview with Fessenden, a commentary, a behind the scenes feature, and storyboards. The movie's picture quality is excellent, for what that is worth, but since the movie tanks I think you would be better off spending your hard earned coin on something else. Art snobs might love a movie like this; heck, even I like cerebral pictures like this one on occasion, but not on this outing.
1,This is a really bad movie....  Lauren Bacall says in the movie that she is 50 years old....  she looks more like she's in her late 60's....  A fan is infatuated with this old woman....  most certainly not beleivable.....  and that song and dance number was awful....  do yourself a favor and skip this one....
1,From one horror movie fanatic, this movie was just bad. I personally like movies that give you some kind of a back ground to what "it" is. Say a spirit from a scorned girl, or a boy who was killed to soon. Give me a reason to be scared of "it" for me without a real reason the movie was a bust. But that is from my perspective I can respect the reviews of others that say the movie was good and I can respect their reasons, but for a horror buff such as myself I couldn't be scared or jump because honestly "it" wasn't a scary enough reason to be. The actors were great, the idea was even good but for me it was just a flat movie with no real story line that made me really scared.
1,II'm watching the first season with a friend, and what I find most glaring is that, compared to the broadcast sequencing on the IMDB, the discs have the stories way out of order!
1,"Left Behind", as a series of books, are superb and extremely popular. The movie adaptation on the other hand is so poor it's as un-funny as the Rapture itself.		I recognize that religious communities are frustrated because they can't seem to market their messages properly in the mainstream movie industry (It has since worked with Mel Gibson's "Passion of the Christ" and the well-done "Prince of Egypt"), but with this film you can bet why Hollywood doesn't turn the other cheek.		First let me tackle the marketing. This film boasts one of the worst marketing failures I've ever seen, and I'll tell you why. They shot "Left Behind" under a reasonably tight budget, then instead of just releasing it into theaters decided to put them out on DVD (and VHS) and select theaters simultaneously, so that when people BOUGHT the movie and told their friends about it, they would then be compelled to WATCH it in theaters. Needless to say, it was a dumb move and thus cements the movie-making aspect of the "Left Behind" franchise as a dismal failure, unless it shapes up for a "Nicolae" movie. It's unfortunate really, because everything about the books screams for top-notch cinematic treatment.		Onto the movie. I remember praising "Taxi Driver" because everyone who was involved in its production, down to the lighting and cinematography, worked in flawless harmony to create a great film. The direct opposite is achieved here. The directing, the special effects, the cinematography, the continuity, and much more are all screwed up and manage to drown out considerable acting by, let's face it, washed-out actors. The character of Nicolae Carpathia, the anti-christ, is seriously underplayed. I won't delve into the unnecessary pop song that represents the film, because it is truly stupid and irritating.		As I say with every bad movie, rent it first and formulate your own opinion, but I strongly recommend the books over this poor imitation of what could have been a tale of horror, excitement and the endearing power of faith and truth.
1,Do not pay money for this production.  Do not support Michael Moore.  He scripts dialogue and passes it off as interviews.  He deliberately brainwashes his constituents.	Don't believe me?  Did the Pilgrims really jump off their ship and immediately start shooting Native Americans?  No.  But after watching the cartoon, what's the first image that will pop into your head when you think about it?  ("I loves my gun...  Loves my gun...")	What was the purpose of a cash refund for the bullets?  They quite obviously worked!  And what was "won" at K-Mart?  Nothing!	How does 11,000 gun-related deaths per year (I won't even check the figures) suddenly become 11,000 murders?  What about self-defense situations, accidents, suicides?  Michael Moore is trying to convince you that American is cuture of paranoia.  It isn't, but it may be if people keep listening to this idiot.	Do yourself a favor and research gun control and crime statistics yourself, rather than wasting time with *Bowling for Columbine*.
1,Wow, where to begin... I have read the book but Im not one to pick a movie apart based on the book. If I did, I'd have to tear Lord of the Rings to pieces (which I loved as a movie). Anyway, Seeker is hands down the worst movie I've seen in a long while. It takes a 9 on my Eyes Wide Shut Scale of Bad Movies. Why? Terrible acting... super-over-the-top melodramatic scenes... an annoyingly inconsistent and incomprehensible plotline... idiotic amount if tension building with absolutely no pay off. In short its a lot like an episode of Dragonball Z, in a kids' fantasy movie clothing.
1,Waste of time
1,We were bored, so we watched this movie and had a laugh.
1,What's wrong with raising a baby in a beach house?  Am I the only person who doesn't live in a mansion?  Do you have to be rich to be happy?		This movie, and the original remake (since that's what these films are) tell a lot of lies about what people should expect life to be.  Therefore, they are not fun.  All the humor evaporates when you realize it is attempting to tell you "your life should be this way" or you're wrong if it is not.  Unfortunately, not everyone has a picture perfect life.
1,Do not buy!  Ten minute waste for creature fans!
1,Decent performances from the cast, particularly Melissa McCarthy, off-set the hackneyed story of "the crotchety neighbor with the heart of gold". I guess there are no more original ideas in the world, but must these same old tropes be manufactured so efficiently and so very very predictably? Like the work of Spielberg, this is a "Hallmark Card" movie that manipulates its audience's feelings with predictable cliches backed by dishonest, tear-jerking symphonics. The actors barely redeem the proceedings (tho indeed, they do)...  Who green-lights these multi-million dollar, calorie-free soap-ettes? Oh yeah: "sounds like a winner" accountants looking at a projected bottom line.	  I realize actors, directors, writers, etc need to pay their bills. But they should each be reminded of the schlockmeister's memorable quote before beginning: "If it ain't on the page, it ain't on the screen." Right Steve??
1,In truth the show's been going downhill since Season 4. The 5th Season was a little better but Season 6 was an all time low.		Where do I begin from the re-hash of old ideas (Freaks, Red Kryptonite, main character fasking death) to characters acting out of character (Martha, Chloe, CLARK).		The worst thing though is that Clark has actually taken a huge backwards step towards being Superman. I CANNOT SEE THIS BIG DUMB ALIEN BEING THE MAN OF STEEL.		Why...?		He kills... SUPERMAN DOES NOT KILL...!		He still after SIX YEARS pines for Lana... WHAT ABOUT JOHANTHAN KENT DEAD FOR OVER A YEAR & HARDLY MENTIONED!!!		Also he gets upstaged IN HIS OWN SHOW by characters like LAAAANA & The GREEN ARROW.		Another problem is character development.		Yes it's good that Lois is now into journalism BUT PLEASE NOT BY LIGHT SWITCH FOR GOD'S SAKE!!!!		Also Lex another character who has seemingly LIGHT SWITCHED to evil!!!		The baby plot line was the most stupid plot line ever conceived in the history of PLOTS all it served to do was to make Lana look like a victim. But I repeat really I'll repeat LANA IS NOT A VICTIM SHE CHOSE TO BE WITH LEX ON HER OWN FREE WILL KNOWING THAT LEX DID SOME SHADY DEALINGS. Either that or the writers want us to think she's stupid!!!		The worst moment of the show though came on the episode Prototype or 6:21 when Martha is leaving to be State Senitor BECAUSE SHE KNOWS A RICH BUSINESSMAN WHO HAPPENS TO KNOW CLARKS SECRET. Clark gives his blessing saying 'That's what Dad would have wanted.' Yes one of the few times Johnathan Kent's name was mentioned!!!		But this is all wrong because remember six years back at a certain Pilot episode & after Clark had saved Lex from the bridge Lex brought Clark a car but JOHNATHAN KENT told Clark to give back the car because... 'WASN'T SAVING A LIFE ENOUGH???'		What a sad pathetic excuse of a SUPERMAN this Clark is becoming I'm sure Johnathan was spining in his grave as Clark gave that sad excuse of a speech!!!		The season really has some real stinkers & some of the worst of the shows entire history!!!		Well here's a list!!!		6:3 Wither- Stupid Vine Lady Phantom who'd just as well be a FOTW!!!		6:7 Rage- Drugs serim episode that's been done over a million times!!!		6:8 Static- One of the worst episodes ever!!!		6:9 Subterranean- Perhaps the worst episode ever!!!!		6:12 Labyrinth- Clark has a trip in his head. Lana tries to kill him. So BDA decides at the end that he must be in love with Lana???		6:14 Tresspass- Yet another Lana stalker episode!!!		6:21 Prototype- CLARK KILLS AGAIN!!!		And others that were nearly as bad		6:2 Sneeze- Cheesey excuse of an episode just to introduce a super power!!!		6:5 Reunion- Boring Lex & Ollie episode!!		6:6 Fallout- The Bow Wow show= Stupid alien who kills people for no reason at all!!!		6:17 Combat- CLARK KILLS AGAIN!!!		6:18 Progeny- Moya Sullivan comes to Smallville & err... nothing else of importance really happens!!!		That's 11 poor episodes that's half the season.		The rest was ok but there were episodes (a few) that were worth watching!!!		6:1 Zod- Zoooood		6:11 Justic- Cool action!! What show the should be going towards instead of stupid Soap Opera nonsense!!!		6:16 Promise- Cool episode, with interesting format & shock yet interesting ending (AKA Characters moving forward instead of being static like they basically were for this entire season!!!		TO CONCLUDE		Al-Miles please read a comic or at least research on WHAT SUPERMAN IS before you even start thinking of writing a 7th Season...		HAVE		CLARK MOVING TOWARDS HIS DESTINY		LEX BECOMING MORE EVIL, AKA OBSESSED WITH SAVING THE WORLD BUT IN HIS OWN TWISTED WAY (This was one of the few highlights of Season 6).		CHARACTERS PROGRESSING & MOVING FOWARD.		BUILDING STORIES EPISODE BY EPISODE TO EVENTUALLY LEAD TO ONE GIGANTIC EPISODE (WATCH BABYLON 5 FOR THE BEST EXAMPLE OF THAT!!!)		DON'T HAVE		PEOPLE LOVING LANA OR CLARK OR LEX OR ANYONE IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH HER THEN GET RID OF HER!!!		CLARK KILLING PEOPLE. THIS IS SUPERMAN NOT BATMAN!!!		OTHER CHARACTERS FROM SUPERMAN MITHOS BEFORE THEY ARE MEANT TO BE INTRODUCED JUST TO HAVE SHORT TERM HIGH VIEWERS!!!!		ANY SOAP OPERA RUBBISH AKA ANGST, PEOPLE ACTING CRAZY JUST TO SERVE THE PLOT!!!		JIMMY OLSEN... WHY WAS HE EVEN THERE!!!		CHARACTERS WHO TAKE THE ATTENTION OF THE ACTUAL SUPPOSED STAR OF THE SHOW... CLARK!!!		CLARK IN LOVE WITH LANA!!!		LANA PERIOD... CAN SOMEONE TELL ME WHY SHE IS STILL IN THE SHOW!!!!
1,This movie is not based on a book. It literally starts with Robert Redford in the middle of the ocean. There is no back story or after story. Does he get rescued? You'll have to watch the movie to find out, but I wouldn't watch it again, EVER.
1,They really decided to stretch the dollars of kill la kill fans when they made this series. This may look awesome but 60$ for 4 episodes and an artbook is nowhere near worth what it should be. I understand that each frame is being redone and new frames are being added, but it just isn't worth the money at the moment. Buy it if you REALLY have to have it in your collection. If you are looking to own the whole series though, and don't want to spend $450 on 25 episodes of anime, then i suggest you wait for a box set or something more affordable at least.
1,This is an extremely shady, sub-par operation, cost-cutting at every opportunity, resulting in every disc being scratched, most so badly that they freeze the DVD.  In the end you will be able to see about half of the movies all the way through.  The others will freeze the DVD halfway through, or not be playable at all.
1,If you were expecting a real cheesy, humor-filled horror-fest with the first Sleepaway Camp and didn't get what you were looking for, then don't worry, because Sleepaway Camp 2 brings all those elements into the mix, and gratitutous sex and violence are present throughout. And if you're a big fan of comedy-horror films, you're in luck. But it does have one common thread from the first film, which is the death scenes are pretty cool. My personal favorite is the "crapper scene", as I like to call it! As for the storyline, its really not that bad, but don't get your hopes up..there is no shocking ending like that of the first film. I'm just kinda disappointed that they chose to go in this direction after the first movie. I'm not a big fan of comedy-horror movies, especially when its a sequel to a more seriously made movie. Again, I liked most of the other elements this movie brings, but there was way too much comedy for me in this one.
1,As a deaf person, I will not be able to hear this film, but will give it to my son.  I'm very sad because I missed the original and the revival on Broadway.  Forgive me for giving what may be a wonderful film (how can I know) one star, because it is inaccessible to all deaf and hard of hearing people.  We will gladly pay a few bucks more to support Closed Captioning.
1,Went too sleep.watching the first ten minutesof this movie. The information looked interesting, but may have just been my mood for the day and time.
1,Utter garbage and and unsatisfying waste of  my hour and 39 minutes.		I'll bet me mum that you will feel the same way.
1,Ah yes, the man is a gentleman and a scholar! A fine liver-spotted trophy of yester-year's own flippant little charades. Manipulated events wherein, just as today, soulless geeks get to vent their revenge on the world and the bullying grunts who inhabit it by directing the blind, head-on fate of thousands and millions of hapless souls who, through no real fault of their own, have gotten in the way of the Gameplan, or were severely influenced by the way the big Game is played.		As I stared into the black, beady eyes of an old and withered Robert Strange McNamara (yes, that's his real middle name) during the viewing of "The Fog of War", it occurred to me that perhaps no man, living or dead, has forcibly lied to himself as convincingly and consistently, (esp. with such grave reprocussions concerning the fate of mankind) as has this horrible beast. Notice the certain joy and flippancy in his voice when he chirps and ribbets about the way he played the game when it was his turn at the table!		 O, undoubtedly there have been fouler birds (but certainly not many) which have spread their wings to block out the sun, but could any of them have been more convinced that they were endeavoring to do right before God and man?		One cannot help but note the bitter irony, as we listen to Bob rattle on remorselessly about his role in the fire-bombing of Tokyo at the end of WWII, which killed over 100,000 civilians, then get all choked up and teary-eyed about how he was the one to pick out the plot location for the final resting place of his goodbuddy Jack, during that fateful November of '63.		Obviously a walking dichotomy, a Type-A case study for the division of mind and spirit, ol' Bob counterdicts and implicates himself with reckless abandon over the course of this film.		A choice quote straight from his thin, bloodless lips, "Whenever I am asked a question I don't want to answer, I reply with the answer to the question I wish I was asked. This is a rule which has served me well." Woo-eee! Obviously the model for all our current political hacks.		His calloused appraisals of the unnecessary casualties suffered from his many executive blunders, and of those around him, as being a worthwhile price to pay to achieve their noble aims, is fine insight into the mind of the tyrannical warmongers which have controlled the fate of mankind since our supposed "civilization".		While listening to some of the snickering tales he recounts of the wretched General LeMay, in which McNamara makes botched attempts at infusing elements of wit and humor into the scenarios, I once again realized how out of touch with humanity our "leaders" trully are. They obviously view themselves as some sort of superior life form, which is perhaps, simply just the type of egotistical scum such positions of power inevitably attract.		Without coming straight out and saying "It was me! I am the horrible mutant to blame for these attrocities!" McNamartyr implies his guilt concerning the unforgivable fire-bombings of some 27 major Japanese cities BEFORE the bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. These are details I feel gipped at never having been exposed to in American History 101. Having obliterated so much of that country's infrastructure and wiped out half of its' population, one can't help but wonder, "Were the A-bombs necessary for Japan's surrender?!" The answer of course is "Hells no!" It was simply another test of our nuclear capability, which a few crusties at the Pentagon, and their handlers, deemed necessary.	Next Bob dances like a woodland fairy around the Bay of Pigs and the Gulf of Tonkin debacles, before settling for a slight bit of self-implication, while pinning ultimate resposibility on the Commanders in Chief. (Which is fair enough, but does little to cleanse his own blood-stained hands.)		I would suggest any who view this movie to go to the special features and check out all the additional footage. It really adds to the film and further exposes McNamartyr as being far from reformed, still as wily and dangerous a monster in old age as he was in youth. (One can only surmise that it was his enormous ego and craving for one last bask in the limelight which coaxed him from the shadows to devulge such a lurid tale.) The extra footage also shows how he is still covering for the "secret" world government which has us all in bondage; his tight lipped responses to a few key questions definitely prove him to be a loyalist, capable of taking their secrets to his grave. (Research the board members of the World Bank and the Council of Foreign Relations if you care to know who is really in charge. Are we to think that Bob's appointment to head the World Bank after his dismissal as Secretary of Defense, is pure coincidence? Sheesh. How stupid do we look?)		All in all, a very enlightening and thought-provoking documentary, which allows you to draw your own conclusions, while giving you enough info to discern it correctly. If you pay careful attention and can read between the lines at times, Bob does a fine job of exposing some of the behind-the-scenes developements and plot twists which show how the system operates and how we got to where we are at in current world affairs.		This film loses four stars from me on account of the glaring omission concerning any discussion with ol' Bob on the subject of the vile and traiterous sinking of the USS Liberty by the Israeli military off the Sinai Peninsula June 8, 1967 during the "Six Day War" between Israel and the Arab states of Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Iraq. This attack killed 34 U.S. servicemen and wounded at least 173.	Multiple inquiries by both sides into the incident concluded that it had been simply a mistake of identity.		If you can call several hours of continuous strafing by fighter planes and a full-on assault by torpedo boats, an "accident".		Some still cling to this belief in hopes that our government is being run by hapless fools, oblivious to the reprocussions of their actions. (It sure appears that way if you yourself are oblivious to their master plan.)		But all the signs show them to be most cunning devils, devious to the enth degree, quite content to bathe in whatever amount of blood necessary to achieve their goal of world domination and enslavement.		So, I snatch back four stars for both that omission and Mr. Morris' over-all failure to hold ol' B Mac's toes to the flame in regards to his most obvious attrocities.		Still, I would highly recommend this as a must-see film.	P.S. On a side note; didn't Rumsfeld, with all his forked-tongue deceit, seem like ol' Bob's political re-incarnation? Even down to the way he was dismissed after serving his purpose. Another part of the repetitious cycle one can find during careful scrutiny of un-propagandized accounts of history.
1,I had seen this many years ago and thought I remembered liking it.  It was really stupid--plot, situations.  I wish I had spent my money otherwise
1,It is never a good thing when the cover art of a DVD - or any product for that matter - is way better than  the product itself.  As is the case - and "case" - here.  Spoiler Alerts:  On the cover of the DVD we have a graphic of the Monster wherein he looks truly gigantic (give the angle of the image) and wherein one clearly sees a stitched-on leg and the Creature is wearing some impressive duds.  Anyway, the guy in the graphic is not seen in the actual movie at all - and now I know why the DVD cover is, indeed, a graphic and not a screen-shot.		THE FRANKENSTEIN THEORY had the germ of a marvelous idea - but the movie remains a germ.  Nothing vis-a-vis Mary Shelley's masterpiece is really explored in this ultimately tiresome "found footage" flick.  We never learn how it is Mary Shelley got involved in turning a "true" story into her immortal novel. Back-story to Professor Venkenheim (who is to be the descendant of the actual maker of the Monster) is scarce. The preparations for the documentarians' actual expedition are also lacking in their believability. (They learn how to handle a snowmobile on site? Really?) There is, in short, no convincing build-up to the premise of the plot.  What there is in this minimal approach indirectly reveals that the makers of this movie didn't seem to really have the courage of their convictions.  And while the "found footage" approach can be justified in that the original novel is patched together (as was the Creature) from several "authentic" sources, the "found footage" approach as witnessed in all too many contemporary horror films has by now grown terribly tedious and trite.  It is also an easy way for today's filmmakers to promise much and show little. With such an approach it is also all too easy to make enormous profits with little outlay. I paid close to thirty bucks for this film because the cover was evocative, the premise sounded sound and I love all things Frankenstein.  But the payoff wasn't there for such an over-priced product.		And so many lost opportunities!  Apart from fleshing out the back-story, what about addressing the immense intelligence of the Creature as he is shown to have in the novel?  How great it would have been to show him as did Shelley - and in the film's climactic scene, wherein the Professor tries to talk to the Creature, how truly pulse-pounding it would have been to hear the Monster articulate!  Even if off-camera!  Instead the Professor is naught but Professor Carrington from THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD, attempting to communicate with that film's title character only to get savaged.  The Creature, in this movie, could have and should have been made sadly sublime and truly tragic.  Instead, the not-much-bigger-than-the-average-football player is nothing more than a big bad bear or a badass Bigfoot.		In short, a great idea that leads nowhere.
1,So bad I didn't watch it all
1,History	I knew when ordering that the movie might not live up to modern day standards of film making, however it was a treat to see Rita Hayworth in her prime.  Well worth the purchase.
1,Normally, I'd preface this type of review with a bold "SPOILER ALERT", but I suspect those who've yet to see this film couldn't make sense of the spoilers anyway. I'm not sure one can really "spoil" such a convoluted plot even if they tried.		I'd like to give this film 5-stars for its originality and a very creative concept in the best tradition of Arthur C. Clarke (as noted is a few other reviews), but a lot of that creativity was lost on a plot that became too obtuse and burdensome for its own good -- which is why I have to give it a 1-star.  I like films that are intellectually challenging but prefer not to have my brain fried during the experience. And that's the quandary I had with "Primer", it was too smart and too film-school artsy for it's own good; it's one ripping science fiction yarn that kinda went off into the film festival weeds with way more abstraction than what was needed to tell a relatively simple, but good, story.		The main stumbling block for me:  the plot could've been greatly simplified without losing its appeal. The audience really deserves a few more clues and guideposts along the way to make the cinematic journey that much more enjoyable without sacrificing artistic creativity or the intended meaning of the film. As any good writer knows, stay out of the way of a good idea and let the words flow naturally -- don't embellish, don't add unnecessary artifices for the sake of appearing "artistic"!		On the plus-side, I enjoyed the style and texture of the film from a geeky-person's point of view; the scripting was so natural I thought I was watching a historical documentary. No CGI, no special effects of any kind (although that levitation machine they build in their garage was kind of cool). You don't need a lot of zap-bang-boom-pow effects, battling mega-robots, mindless car chases with somersaulting SUV's, naked body-doubles performing simulated sex to keep people's attention when you have a GOOD STORY to tell!		On the minus side: the plot had WAY TOO MANY versions of Aaron, Abe, boxes and fail-safe boxes to keep track of without the aid of a spreadsheet. What the story lacked was just enough continuity to hold the plot together long enough for people to figure out what was going on. I eventually figured out most of it -- except for the the final scene in the "warehouse". Frankly, I think there were points in the film where the writer/director/actor wasn't entirely sure what was going on.		It seems clear to me (after multiple viewings) that the "beginning" of the film really wasn't the beginning at all given that the first rendition of Abe was, in fact, a time traveler who made the first trip in the machine and traveled back six hours to inform his partner, Aaron (sitting on the park bench) that the trip was successful. He proved it buy taking Aaron to the storage facility where we see the "original" Abe returning to the machine after leaving the hotel.  After that, things got real complicated to the point where we have not one but THREE Aarons running around -- "hoodie" Aaron, "original" Aaron locked up in an attic and rendition #2 Aaron.  Now add in another version of Abe to the mix along with two "fail safe" machines and you have a real mess.  Oh, and don't forget, these time machines are portable -- you can fold one up and take with you back to the past.  Enough, already!!!!!!		Which brings us to the brief final scene: one of the Aarons splits from one of the Abe's at the airport and ends up in this big warehouse directing some sort of activity, presumably building a larger version of the time machine. Many commentators & reviewers saw no special significance in this scene, but I thought it was a rather odd way to end the movie, especially given the low budget -- why shoot unnecessary footage?  And what was with the French-speaking dude directing that crowd of hard-hatted works in the warehouse?		I now believe the entire movie was intended to depict a corrupted time line from the get-go and the Aaron we saw in the warehouse was, in fact, the original Aaron (as opposed to the Aaron locked in the attic).  If you have a better idea, please let me know.
1,Ashely Judd is vibrant in this movie and it's cool to see the younger Hugh Jackman and Greg Kinnear.  Watch this movie while cooking or cleaning up the kitchen.  Definitely not a sit down movie!
1,DVD case was broken and dvd come scratched.
1,This DVD purports to be on a train called "The AMRTAK Broadway Limited" from New York to Chicago.  However. AMRTAK does not or never has had a train called the Broadway Limited.  The Broadway Limited was a Pennsylvania RR Creation - probably the finest Streamliner of the century, but was decommissioned and taken out of service in 1995.  AMTRAK did not pick up the name for one of its trains.  DVS presents false information,
