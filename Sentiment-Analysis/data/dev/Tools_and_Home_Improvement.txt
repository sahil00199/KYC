0,I finally found a light that I can use without the help of a flashlight, how cool is that !  Not only is the light bright enough where I can see the pages, but the seller provided phenomenal customer service .
0,Makes using hose attachments a lot easier!
0,Very good all went well.
0,Works very well, just be careful tightening the screws on the main wires, since the metal used is not as thick/heavy as older switches, and will bend or even crack if torqued too much (ouch - my fault).
0,easy to install
0,I'm not a mechanic but got 2 sets to keep in vehicles.  I probably will never need to use them; just good to have along with screwdrivers, and other basics.
0,A good quality shore power lead from Marinco. Meets all the requirements for your marina power hook-up, positive locks to keep it attached.
0,These relatively inexpensive OTG (Over the Glasses) safety glasses are really convenient to use.  You can slip them on and off without bothering with straps around your head.  They seem to afford a reasonable amount of protection from flying debris hazards and are especially suitable for short duration indoor work.		The packaging also brags about providing UV protection.  I have no way to test that claim, but I found a statement from the manufacturer that it aborbs 99.9% of the UVA and UVB radiation up to 400nm.  If you're going to be doing a lot of work outside (like gardening) I suggest looking at the tinted lens versions which provide additional protection.  There's even an SCT version (Spectrum Control Technology) which is suitable for work in research environments posing UV light hazards.  I wouldn't depend on the clear lenses for those specialized applications.		They fit very well over my relatively large bi-focals.		But, if I'm going to be sanding or grinding I prefer tighter fitting goggles so that debris doesn't sneak around the edges.		These are very clear, provide good visibility (92% Visible Light Transmittance) and they're inexpensive enough to replace when they get too scratched up.
0,Like the size, the design and comfort while using the tool. But I would like for the bits to stay tighter on the shaft. Sometimes they fall inside my tool pouch when more tools are next to them.
0,This seat was easy to install and sits much more comfortably than the plastic seat that came with our new 12-in Rough-In WaterSense Elongated 2-Piece Chair Height Toilet.  I think I will like the easily removable seat for cleaning purposes.  It fits on snugly and fits the toilet perfectly, is an exact white color match and looks nice.  I cannot speak to the durability of this seat we have only had it a few days.  The shape of the seat is rounded but slightly highest on the outside of the seat which is not quite as comfortable as another toilet seat we have that is rounded up in the center of the seat ring.
0,Cable is durable and amazingly flexible for a size 12/3 extension cord.  Use with electric tools and lawn mower.
0,I like them. Good price. I use one on dim to light up a sign, and the other to light up my flag pole on bright. One draw back is the switch. While charging for the first time I didn't know if it is off or on. You just push the button until you have light once it is charged.
0,Great buy and easy to install.  Took me about two minutes to remove old knobs and replace them with the new Kwikset levers.  Looks great on the internal doors.
0,Nice but this does not contact brush and there's no way to drain bottom. Seems unsanitary.
0,It worked and was much cheaper on Amazon!
0,100% satisfied
0,Works great, feel much safer wearing it.
0,The Irwin saw blade was exactly as described buy the Vender. The saw blade was a great value and works perfect I wished I had bought more than two.fast shipping
0,Easy to install.  The shower head side cannot be PEX because you should use copper if you are using this as a tub valve.  If you use PEX, water would drip out of the head while filling up the tub.  Been there & done that....
0,Great price...Exactly as descripbed.
0,great product and service
0,Bought for a costume.  Look sturdy for workers needed. Not an expert .
0,Best investment I ever made. I have to say this 12 volt Bosch impact is the handiest tool I have ever owned. I was so tired of having to use my heavy cordless drill for certain things. I bought this refurbished but I believe it was new and never used. Came with 2 batteries but one battery lasts forever. I bought some 1/4" extensions for sockets and I have used it for everything possible. I even used it to take my whole 1450 Cub Cadet apart to refurbish it. Only time I pick up the drill now is to use a drill bit. This has saved me many hours. Wish I had this 30 years ago! It has the power for almost anything. Of course it isn't like a 1/2" air impact but it does the job on most things. If you work on a lot of lawnmowers like me this is a life saver! Perfect for putting in sheetrock and deck screws too.
0,Love my Dremel!!
0,daughter wanted colored lights for party.  Performed as advertised.
0,This stapler works very well.  Has good power and sinks the staples flush to the surface.  I did not recognize this brand as I have never purchased this brand; but the price was right and I won't use it as much as a nailer so I decided to get it and it is better than I expected.
0,Does what it needs to. Fits perfect with other POWERTEC fittings and hose.
0,MUCH brighter than expected! setting them up could not possibly be any easier. I will say for the people that are saying they are too white (600k) that is incorrect. I would say these are more around the 4500k mark.
0,I absolutely LOVE this pot.  I've used it twice.  First for a wonderful pot roast, searing meat first, cooking meat in Lipton Onion Soup for three hours and adding veggies last.  Wonderful.  Secondly for the most heavenly pot of our special recipe chili.  Sweet perfection.  Oh, and getting the wonderful potholder (which you don't even need with this pot), the great wooden spoon and the kitchen towel was a bonus.  I only buy Calphalon and had been considering the cast iron enamel dutch oven, but because of my past experience with Le Creuset, I thought it would be way too heavy and hard to handle for me.  I highly recommend this wonderful pot and lid with the cool to touch handles.  And as always, Calphalon is easy to clean.		September 22, 2010:  I still love this pot!  Great for soups too.  I paid about half the price seen today when I bought mine.  Sure glad I bought it when I did.		April 14, 2011:  I still love this pot!		March 8, 2012:  I paid $99.95 in 2009.  The pot went up to $200 and has now disappeared.  I STILL love and use this pot year round.  It's my soup pot, it's my chili pot, searing pot, whatever I need it for.  I still love it and am thrilled to have it.
0,I bought two of these, and now I'm a huge fan of the medallions.
0,These LED bulbs are bright enough to easily illuminate any area at night time;  Significantly brighter than your average night light bulbs (incandescent or LED).  Nice, warm color too.		I would have given it five stars, but they don't work well with dusk sensor night lights (they flash on and off).  Still, at 0.5 watts (rated - not measured), putting them on a switched night light wouldn't be a big deal as it would take almost 3 months of continous use to hit 1KWH -- thus approximately than US$0.60 per year (at US$0.13 / KWH) to run, continuously.		I'd definitely buy these again, assuming they last as long as they should.
0,Product seems okay, can't really tell the difference but that's probably because I've been using it for so long. Easy to install.
0,My Leatherman Charge Titanium fits in this case perfectly.
0,This was the fix for my very low water flow in two of my sinks (kitchen and laundry sinks)..		Before purchasing this, call Kohler - they shipped me two of these (I have two sinks which use these faucets) for FREE.
0,Surprised by these lamps... very nice construction and quality.  I was worried they'd break in shipping, but they were packaged very well.  Overall a good buy!
0,Great
0,Very good lock. It can probably be drilled out, but picking is difficult because of position.
0,Bought this to cut tin on roof this works great
0,Worked as it should
0,Works good for my lug nuts
0,Far better than the typical unit home builders install ( and the price on Amazon was almost identical to the other unit). Has been in light duty service for about a year with no issues.	My original was wired direct, and I figured it would be easier to remove the cord and wire this one the same way. WRONG.	I did it, but it would have been a lot less work to install an outlet on the end of the Romex, than it was to remove the cord from this unit.
0,I use these for a soft glow on interview sets. I love the glow.		I wish they were silk, but then again, that would cost more. One of these days, I'll invest.
0,Great product. Works as advertised.	I use it for about one year and so far so good!
0,Unbelievable how many times this little guy will power the gate but it does!
0,Works. Easy to set up. If you have the old one just set the internal switches the same as the old one. If you lost the old one you must open the box on the roof of your garage mechanism and look at the positions of the switches -  and off you go.
0,these are good solar lights, large solar panel,and work exactly as advertised.
0,good price
0,ITs a bit on the thin side but works ok .still gotta try it out on more tree branches an limbs.....
0,My fourth graders have lockers this year and I didn't trust them to remember a combo. This is perfect and working great!
0,Had to cut the foam a little to fit my closet door but after the cutting was done defenitly cut down on the draft from the door. Door opens and closes without any issue.
0,Have been carrying this for a couple of weeks now. Smaller than I expected and super light. Had to loosen the pivot a touch to make it really fast and smooth to open. Excellent knife and I am looking forward to using it. If you have large hands , this knife might be too small for you.
0,cheaper than a single unit at the local big box home improvement center.  needed 4; saved 25 dollars and have plenty left for next spring/as needed
0,This light fixture was a perfect compliment to our bathroom remodel. The finish matched our accessories perfectly. My wife and daughter were surprised to see the bathroom as it was a surprise remodel while they were away. The light fixture really finished the bathroom off. The price of this light was lower than the big box stores.
0,They're pretty simple, but what I wanted in pipe insulation! They protect my garage door and van liftgate from damaging each other when they hit.
0,Fit on my Jeep good and no issues
0,I needed this to replace a wooden seat. This is much easier to clean.
0,Excellent product.
0,3 times using them a hole developed in the finger, contacted seller and refunded my money.
0,i bought this gun to refinish some bathtubs.  after the purchase, i ordered epoxies and various other chemicals from midwest chemicals to get the job done.  they sort of slammed the gun, saying that it was a good hobby gun and is okay for a 2 stage sprayer.  i was told a 3 stage sprayer will atomize the paint and give a total pro finish, whereas the 2 stage sprayer will tend to throw small globs of paint and leave a slight texture.  bummer.  i never used the gun.		i now own the hv3500.  it always seems i get burned when trying to save money on tools.  might as well buy the right one the first time.		  i'll review the 3500 after these tubs get done.
0,Used this item to change out wheel hubs on an 08 Silverado. Came in really handy!
0,More light for less cost.
0,Perfect. Well made.  Excellent. AAAAAAAAA++++++++++
0,Quick shipping. Solid bar stock, not the cheap hollow ones at the box stores.
0,Great pocket knife.  Got a good deal when it was on sale, now I carry this thing every day.
0,Anchors, what is there to say. Price was good and worked as suppose too.
0,works good just hard to tell if actually spinning since it makes no noise.
0,Warm and dry. Excellent finger mobility (e.g. Operating ATV with electric snow plow) Worth the money.
0,PRODUCT WORKS GREAT, I USED IT WHEN I USED SPRAY PAINTS THAT ARE HARMFUL IF USED IN CONFINED	AREAS.	THEY SAVE MONEY BECAUSE YOU CAN REUSE THE MASK OVER AND OVER.
0,Installation is easy and straight forward.  Programming is simple, but you need the directions.  This appears to be a very simple basic thermostat that does not confuse the user very much.  I bought one and then a second as I have two furnaces in my house.  They both are doing the job nicely over the old Mercury style Honeywells with time clock movements.
0,Have been using these hammers for a short time now and are holding up great.  No chips coming off the heads and the handle's aren't splitting.  You get a fair amount of "feedback" through the handle on hard hits but but nothing uncomfortable.
0,Works as advertised with our older Intellicode opener.
0,Good, but not as good as my old black & decker sawhorse.
0,still using the same blade. i think i use this almost everyday and all good.
0,It's like angels come down from heaven and clean your butt parts.  Seat will need some spacers about 1/2 inch thick after install.
0,Good quality, Harbour Freight doesn't carry the size in singles. They are about $10.00 @ the auto part store
0,This is a really great flashlight for your keychain. I originally passed it over, because it used 4 hearing aid batteries until I found 100 of them on sale on Amazon for about $0.05 each. I have had it for about a year and the outside of the base of it has lost the coating due to wear, but it is still working great. One thing to note about this flashlight is the coating inside. I had an uncoated (bare aluminum) cheaper version that had to have a thin plastic sleeve inside to keep the batteries from shorting out. It was a pain to change batteries with it. The coating on the inside of this flashlight keeps the batteries from shorting and makes it much easier to change batteries. I noticed that some reviewers have had trouble with the front unscrewing in their pocket. I have not had that problem, because the O-ring seal provides enough friction to prevent unscrewing. If the threads are too loose, check to make sure the O-ring has not come off. Also, don't unscrew it to turn it off more than the 1/4 turn that the instructions indicate.
0,I use this to pick my nose. works
0,Bought this for a bathroom ceiling fan. Works great.	It comes with two complete face plates, one white and one cream colored.	I like the fact that if you press a longer time, it 'counts down' by lighting up the lower numbers when it reaches that amount of time left.	I'll be buying another one when I get around to doing my other bathroom.
0,Great little knife
0,When I travel for work I use two bags - a hefty shoulder strap briefcase and a rollaboard.  Splitting the load keeps each bag's weight manageable; I sometimes shift heavy briefcase items to the rollaboard if I don't need quick access or when travelling to/from airports.		This worked so well that I decided to get the smaller Customer Leathercraft L234 to allow me to "balance the load" and make it easier to find what I'm looking for when I'm doing projects at home or for theatre set construction.  This bag was an ideal choice for my needs.  The 18" size would have held more, but been heavier (when loaded with all of the stuff I'd feel compelled to drag along "just in case".  I find myself using the new bag for the commonly used items, such as my impact driver(s) and drills and accessories, socket set, various hand tools and miscellaneous carpentry must haves.  I've relegated my older bag to "bulk storage" (screws, extra driver bits (in case the primary ones wear out), etc...) and my heavier power tools such as my circular saw and power cord.  This was I have my new, well lit, bright colored bottom bag to keep well organized and easily find the things I need 95% of the time.		I love the pivoting light, mostly to look inside the bag but also to provide some lighting in the area I'm working, facing down onto a work piece, etc...  Obviously, it's not practical to use a heavy tool bag as a portable flashlight...nevertheless, it does come in handy.		I really like the folding handle which locks into the up position but is easily pivoted to allow simple unimpeded access to the full interior of the bag with its myriad of useful pockets.		I'm guessing I'll have fewer lower back strains from carrying my tools balanced between my two hands/shoulders.		A great acquisition that I'm sure will continue to perform well for many years to come.
0,Works great.
0,This does not fit the Harbor Freight 36" Chicago Electric Wood Lathe, that banjo must be widened. That said, it's pretty nice. It's a little more bulky than it needs to be, but it is robust and will not bend easily as it is. It is not for tiny bowls.
0,Arrived on time.  With fixture wiring adapted works great.  Love the White light.
0,Ambidextrous for all of us lefties!
0,works fine.
0,Very useful when giving a shower to a child
0,This moisture meter is very easy-to-use requires no batteries and is a very handy tool for monitoring your potted plants inside or out. It's easy to read and gives you confidence that you were watering properly.
0,Works great as a back check valve for my RO system. Just cut the drain/backwash line and insert the tube into both ends.
0,My sister decided we ( her & I ) needed to make a "Emergency/To Go Bag".	I ordered 2, one for each of us.	I like how compact it is . . . This is now in my handbag . . . The items included in this small space is great for those little daily needs
0,Good little light. Doesn't add much weight to my keychain. Would prefer a adjustable beam - maybe on a later model? Could be a bit cheaper in price but overall it's bright enough and seems built well. Looks way better than those Energizer keychain LED's.
0,Description lists the material as brass but this shower head is mostly plastic.	Looks nice and the spray has a strong enough feel, even on the lower flow setting.  I can recommend it.
0,great for behind fridge or behind t.v
0,Worked perfectly in my American Standard Model 4010
0,If you're working at a manufacturer specific car dealership, chances are they already have an amp clamp laying somewhere around the shop for everyone to use.  What about those of us that have our own independent service businesses, or those who work at an independent garage, or do some side-work when we get home?  Combine the Fluke i410-kit with the Fluke 88-V kit and you have the perfect set-up for troubleshooting electrical issues.  This clamp works, it's accurate, and it's compatible with the Fluke 88-V automotive multimeter I already had.  Fluke makes the best stuff.  If you're using it every day, don't you want to be using the best stuff?  Of course you do.  But what about the price, you say?  Well, we can't all buy a Cadillac at a Cavalier price.  One last question...do you want something that will just get you by from job to job or do you want the most accurate, best product for the money that will work consistently for many years to come?  I'll give you a hint, the product you're going to buy is on this page, but it's not in the "Related Products" section.  That is, of course, unless the Fluke i410 shows up in the "Related Products" section.  I'm done typing...buy with confidence.
0,Bought to replace a basic shower head with no wand attachment or method to spray down walls during cleaning.	Build of the product seems good, not too heavy and easy to handle as well as returning head back to the docking that's magnetic.	I like this design better than a common shower wand hook, keeps things neat for a simple shower controls, less to go wrong IMO.		I have yet to drop this unit and have not had it long enough to see how well it holds up, but based on what I see now it looks like it should last a few years or more.
0,these are a god sent when working on my 3D printer and 2560 Mega Boards, worth every cent. i can get strong good crimps everytime now with these.
0,do not know how I could have worked in my wood shop for so many years without this sander, it is extremly well made and has a very large surface to work on..it is great !
0,This is a very good extension cord. Handles 15 amp at 120 volts with no issues. I would recommend this brand.
0,good
0,I use this all the time and it is the best soldering iron for the job. This iron allows you to achieve the perfect heat for every application.
0,I gave this as a gift. The birthday boy liked it.
0,Tools worked perfectly for the first job they were ordered to be used on.  Good product, fast delivery, great price.  What more could I ask?
0,well built very happy with it
0,I don't plan on using actual biological Warfare so, what I know for sure is it does filter out bad household odors.
0,does the job. i love it
0,Makes me feel manly while being organized. Doing the 9 to 5, everyone has a generic plastic black pen holder. I wanted my desk to have a little character.
0,Got this because the incadescent bulb in my old MagLite Solitaire burned out.  Wow, this is so much brighter than the old light, and uses much less current so the battery lasts much longer.  If you have an old single AAA MagLite with an incadescent bulb, now is the time to upgrade to this LED version.  Note that the front parts are not interchangeable between the incadescent and LED versions, though the end cap is.
0,Great addition to the Bladerunner X2. Really helps with 90 degree cuts. Definitely recommend!
0,Great
0,Simple but works great. The belts don't last too long but pretty cheap to replace
0,A nice replacement for my broken shower diverter, for the same product with shipping and all, it was  cheaper than Home Depot and Lowes.  My only complain is that it doesn't stay in place, it tends to spin once you put the weight of the hand shower, I've tried to tight it harder but I'm afraid it could brake.
0,We have a bunch of lights go out in our storage area at work. I thought that I would use a few of these to help illuminate the room while we were removing items.		These seemed a little more focused than I would like, but they are certainly bright. With multiple units, I was able to cover the whole area.
0,Great product for controlling lights off site.
0,These gave off more black light than I expected so I went back and bought some more. I used them to replace the lights in the ceiling canister lights over the dining room table during an 80's party and they really gave off a good amount of light.
0,Easy setup, no cords, and it looks like Boba Fett just had a jetpack malfunction and slammed through your wall!
0,Well that can I say about a toilet seat....easy to install, its durable, and it's comfortable.  Due to these factors....it's tushy approved!
0,Holds the Makita hypoid circular saw very nicely.
0,all the leads I needed. used to have to make my own. goes great with my innova auto-ranging digital meter.
0,Bought this for my child's school locker she is 8. Works perfect as it is easier for her to remember a word rather than a set of numbers.
0,Awesome sunnies,great price!
0,I use this light consistanty without issues. Surprisingly bright for it's size. I really like the sheath. I work in tight quarters so the fact that it stays close to my side and doesn't get in the way is a huge plus.
0,I saved $$$ by buying a repackaged one that works perfectly.
0,It cleaned up the clutter in my garage.		Pros:	Very Easy to setup	Neatly arranges most of my garden tools, specially my broom	Fits nicely on the corner so it is out of the way	Inexpensive		Cons:	It is plastic so just like any Rubbermaid or plastic rack, do not put heavy tools on top. The long Rakes are ok because they do not sit on top of the rack. The heavy motorized hedgers should probably be put somewhere else. I only put my electric hedger since it is light.		Summary:	Just use your common sense and this will help clear and organize your garage.
0,Product arrived early and was as described.  Works great.
0,No complaints. Works like it should.
0,Bought it back in July, 4 months later, it's working great!! One thing I noticed, which isn't necessarily a drawback... if you try to use the WRONG passcode several times, the lock needs to be reset and will not open again until it is, from the other side. Resetting is relatively easy. Now we usually have someone home, so resetting isn't a big deal, but this MIGHT be a problem for a family who cannot get back in if someone else tried to use it multiple times the wrong way. I can't duplicate the problem,, as my son is who encountered it, but in my own experience, it's been flawless, and perfect for our needs.
0,Worked just fine. Easy repair.
0,Excellent
0,The comments section for the champion toilet reveals the need for these if you own those toilets, and if you're reading this then there's a likely chance that you already know the seals eventually leak.		Having three of these toilets for nine years, and very glad to have made the investment, the benefits outweigh the cost.  I don't expect that household items that are used often shouldn't break or even be perfectly engineered, so five stars is warranted in my opinion.  I've only needed these new seals once in all these years, and I bought a few more for the next go around to avoid delaying repairs.		The fix itself is fast and easy, with the instructions supplied for a problem free repair.  Even if you don't have the problem yet, all things tend to break down so just get this and stow it away for the inevitable...
0,Good basic door hinge.  Exceptional value at approximately a $1 a hinge.
0,These and the Nuvo Cocoa Couture Cabinet Makeover Kit really transformed a kitchen in short order.  Just the right size, and enough left to do the bathroom if I wanted to.
0,Very nice product
0,Worked great
0,Cheaper than comparable Weller products. This Hakko soldering station is exceptional quality, at a great price. Very happy with this station!
0,Just what I needed. Glad I purchased it.
0,Good price value and quality. 5 stars all around.
0,Cute little light.  Quite bright.  A bit too much glare and the light is a very cool blue-white.  I use it to light up the area around my keyboard.  I used the provided double stick tape to fix it to the bottom of a book shelf.  To turn it on, there is no actual switch.  A finger touch to the two little sensors on the lens turns it on and off.  Great for the price.  If they wanted to make this outstanding, they could change the design to cycle through 0, 1, 2, 3 leds on.
0,I have a 36" combo glass/screen aluminum door.  After assembling my tools, I had the grill in place in about 5 minutes. Looks nice.
0,Good quality, nice appearance, sturdy and elegant.
0,I replaced a Honeywell RTH2410 unit I purchased in August with this Honeywell RTH3100C. The RTH2410 installed and worked fine except now into the heating season the AUX heat always comes on during the "Heat On" cycle which is so inefficient and always over shoots 1-2 degrees above set point!!! Honeywell was not able to offer any help except that I could return the 2410. I purchased the RTH3100C ... no frills heat pump with aux heat control. It installed easily and works great. No AUX heating and easily maintains the set point. The Aux heat comes on if you change the set point up about 2 degrees as you expect but not on any other time. Maybe I can't program it and the ... which I was not using anyway ... but my heating bill will be considerably less I imagine.
0,Great tool
0,works great.
0,Easy to install. Like the "new" LED lights. Nice and bright, but also very energy efficient. Replaces my old two head unit exactly. Does the job of what an emergency light should do.
0,This new battery made my Roomba better than new.  It runs 3 times longer than it use to and the house is three times as clean.  Highly recommended.
0,I have bought some of these before and am here for more. I live on a farm, and am out in the dark when I get home a lot of times. I have one of these on all car keys and am going to put one on the mower. it surprised me that they will keep a charge forever. they will even charge inside by lamplight. I will give some of these for secret santa gifts. they are sure better than a short lived candle. if you think they want some scent, then buy a two dollar can of air freshner to go with it...you still save a bunch over a fancy candle. oh I forgot to say that they are very bright.
0,I absolutely love it.  I purchase a couple of the cheaper ones before that people liked but they were terrible.  This is awesome.  Easy to use, although the instructions to add a second doorbell was really not in the instructions, so I had to wing it and figure it out myself.  As someone that approved written instructions for medical devices used by (Nurses, Doctors, OR Technicians), I am fully aware of how user instructions must be written so that most people may understand them (the standard is generally 8th grade English).  These are easy enough, however they do need to ask one of their own personnel not familiar with the product at all, to try and attach two door bells to this system using the currently distributed instructions.  This person must not understand the product at all.	Regardless, after figuring out the method installed the two doorbells approx. 40 ft. & 75 ft. (front gate entrance), and they worked perfectly.  Each has its own sound so we know if someone is at our gate or if they gate is unlocked, we know someone is at the front door.  Easy to install and like the couple of chimes that it has.  Would like to be able to add additional chime sounds as the 200 series previously allowed. Other than that, GREAT PRODUCT.  LOVE IT!!!!
0,WORKS  GREAT.
0,Good Product
0,No problems, no surprises, light where you want it.
0,Bought this to replace an old Black and Decker jig saw which I replaced the motor brushes on once already. This saw is much nicer. Changing blades is quick and easy. I only wish it had a compartment to store blades but I'm sure blades get dull if they are stored in built-in compartment.
0,I purchased the Goodyear 045 3/8" by 50'air hose for one reason! It's the best they make. The air hose is made of reinforced rubber. I had a cheap plactic hose, knots every time you wanted to use it,or would colisipe and cut off the air supply and there you go trying to find and untangle it. Simple the rubber hose cost a little more but you will not have any of the above problems!!  I purchased my rubber Goodyear air hose from Amazon .com. Lewis Baker
0,This is so light.  I am a senior and I can lift it with ease!
0,work as expected. No problems.
0,really sharp.  Mesh together well.  Great scissors in the short run.
0,Well made and great for travel.
0,Really worked!!!
0,Good blades!
0,Works exactly as described. No complaints at all. Would happily order this again.
0,Helps a lot while shooting.  I use this in combination with foam inserts!
0,this diverter is better than the one in the main bath and I wish I would have bought 2. so I put it in the master bath. works really good, highly recommended
0,works perfect, is very sensitive and precise.
0,Powerful saw with laser guideline, was used to build me a few picnic tables, garage storage, patio roof, loft bed etc. Used without a hitch and I would buy again if needed to.
0,Had to buy 3 more for friends
0,Nice quality. Really bright. If you find this review helpful, please select "review helpful". It helps me :)		This thing is bright for such a small light. I also have some 8 & 10 LED ones. This one is by far brighter.	The motion works good. It seems to active about 20-30 feet out. The distance of light really depends on how high you mount it. The light shines down and out.		One thing I like about this style of light is, the 45 degree angle of the solar panel. In the Midwest, the sun is lower in the winter. Even on gloomy days, this thing charges and stays lit all night.		Note: This light has an easy to push on/off switch. You can just push the button. Some other brands require a small tool that you have to insert a small tool into a small hole, to activate the on/off switch. I'm guessing its a security feature. So someone can't shut your light off. This isn't an issue because I have mine mounted 8 feet off the ground.
0,Worked just fine out of the box. No flickering. Installed these in my ceiling fan and was happy with the light it produced, however, my devise is a three light system and the lighting is good but would of liked something a little brighter. If you have a four way system I believe you will have a much brighter condition.
0,completely satisfied. little pricey, but definitely worth the extra cost.  If you have the sink...do not hesitate to buy the rack.  No brainer...Really.
0,nice tool, works well in spacy areas
0,Have not used these long so I can not comment on the longevity of this product but the price beat the local store to heck and back. We have several lights that take these bulbs so I purchased 2 orders. If I had not found these at this price I might have opted to change out the halogen lights with LED ones. These bulbs saved me the trouble.
0,Back in '99, give or take a year, I bought a pair of these off the MAC tool van. They are black with a red MAC TOOL logo (see attached photo). Other than color, they are the same heavy-duty reinforced nylon construction, with a very ergonomic action and reliable service.		I've used mine on everything from electronics to automobile wiring to Romex wiring at home. These work well on stranded and solid copper wire, as well as aluminum wire, with most "standard" gauges -- i.e. not on very small / thin gauges like network cable or alarm wire, nor on wires heavier than about 12 ga. Also, these haven't worked so well on older Romex wire where the plastic insulator has become brittle or "baked on" to the copper -- in those instances, these tend to just strip a thin strip of the insulation off, not the whole sleeve.		These were pricey when I purchased them back in the day, and I see they're no cheaper now. However, with the service life I've experienced with mine (non-daily use, but definitely a staple in my electronics/electrics tool bag), I wouldn't hesitate to suggest these. They're the first wire strippers I reach for every time.		And for comparison's sake, I have owned other mechanical strippers over the years, including the overly complicated&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Self-Adjusting-Wire-Stripper/dp/B000OQ21CA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Self-Adjusting Wire Stripper</a>&nbsp;which were entirely unsatisfactory. The only stripper I use regularly that is more reliable is the standard crimper-plier style "manual" strippers, which require a little more work (and effort to make sure I'm selecting the correct gauge of wire), not nearly as fast as these automatic strippers.
0,Matches with my door nicely and it's fancy
0,My older home lacks storage, so this little item has come in handy for storage plastic ziploc bags.  It also seems quite durable.
0,These fit very well over my prescription glasses and provide great protection while shooting outdoors.. The price was very reasonable as well and I
0,Nice light
0,Functions as expected.
0,They are made out of plastic, that's the only reason I gave them 4 stars, because I think over time with cleaning the shine will be rubbed off. Other than that they perform great and look great (at least for now, it's only been two weeks, but let's see if they still have that chrome look once I cleaned with a scrubby sponge)
0,Makes a messy job clean and easy. Love that I keep my area as dust free as possible
0,Very nice quality faucet. I installed myself and it wasn't too difficult, but its tightened down with 1 large nut. Not sure of the size, sorry. But mine loosened up over time and I had to retighten. I was able to use slip-joint pliers but a specialized tool like: LDR 511 1110 11-Inch Faucet Wrench, Fits 1/2 To 1-1/8-Inch, would have made things easier. I added a sealant/caulking on the countertop and it been solid since that time. I really like the look of the fixture and the price was very good. I also like that the flow is substantially better than the faucet that came with our new house. Overall I think this is a nice faucet as does my wife
0,I got tired of always drilling a hole then having to get the tap and die set out. I build lots of project out of steel, and decided to try these. Let me just say I'm sold, it's a great product. At 1st I figured that I would break them, but I was wrong, prefect threads.
0,Costly little beggar, and it sure solves problems.
0,Best investment I made, now to stock up on rechargeable batteries!
0,This is a great buy by Rayovac. The 3 lumens of LED light shine bright and clear illuminating the area around you. The tip of the light builds a white circle of light. It is also small, and compact . Uses only one Triple A Battery, and the handy clip allows you to put the light right in your shirt pocket.
0,worked
0,Made life significantly easier.  I use these in a room where if i turn off the lights, the lights take another 20 minutes to turn back on, so I can keep them on and still make out the line.  Great!
0,Since I bought this drill, I've used it for many different purposes and is a purchase I've been absolutely satisfied with. I've had no issues with the product.
0,Works Perfect with Echo
0,Item looked and functioned exactly as expected. The wall plate mounting screws even matched the spacing of similar mounting holes on the ~10 year old fan's remote... no new holes to drill in the wall.		Installers: double check the DIP switch settings with your fan. Mine were not in agreement out of the boxes.
0,Love it.
0,Awesome product
0,It does the job.
0,finally added a light switch to our pull string living room lamp. thanks to this guy.
0,All of the lamps worked as expected..
0,as advertised happy with purchase
0,Have used this specific filter for many years.  It's effectiveness is proven in how black and grimy they look after a few months usage.  It feels so cathartic exchanging filters, and seeing what this product has leached out of the air.
0,Work great
0,Absolute astounding!  Works perfectly. Half the price of those that didn't work.
0,buy these all the time for flip houses can't beat the price. color matched screws included. perfect.
0,I am not one who wears jewelry but this necklace looks good and throws a mean spark with the attached striker.  Love all the Wazoo items.
0,heavy I use both hands, but works great.
0,good tool holder, keeps small tools and other small items organized and easy to find
0,really work for us ,protects the door against wind and rain
1,too large to fit in most house junction boxes
1,Don't waiste your money!
1,About 3 months after I bought this bulb, it failed. TorchStar refused to honor the 3 year warranty, claiming that I bought it from an unauthorized retailer (even though I bought it on Amazon). I suggest that you purchase a bulb made by a manufacturer that stands behind its products. I learned the hard way that TorchStar does not.		Note that many other buyers have posted reviews saying that this bulb fails after a few months. That's bad enough, but it's particularly bad when the manufacturer refuses to honor its warranty.
1,Doesn't work
1,The nosepiece comes off and leaves you with glasses that will cut your nose. The Kimberly Clark customer support will not send you additional nosepieces. These glasses are all defective - no bargain when you cannot even use them.
1,Here's my disclaimers:		1.  I've never messed with home automation systems before.  I believed the literature and implications of plug-and-play compatibility from several manufacturers of z-wave home automation controllers and peripheral devices.  I purchased this unit because it was programmed in Linux, while the next best candidate was written in embedded Windows XP.  Somehow I figured this would be a better unit in the future.		2.  The last programming that I did was in engineering grad school back in the 70's.		That said, unless  you're a very patient, very serious hobbyist that deals well with frustration and failure, this is not the system for you.  The documentation is miserable at best, and often refers to other MiCasaVerde units rather than the Vera Lite.  The online documentation is not well indexed, the text is cryptic, and I've yet to find instructions regarding the overarching structure of "scenes" and the process for creating them.		There is some limited documentation if you dig online at MiCasaVerde long enough to find instructions about setting defaults on the peripherals and how you should let Vera control them.  The VeraLite unit comes only with a basic sheet instructing you how to connect it to your network and how to connect another device to the VeraLite.  There is no user manual with the unit and no meaningful system design and setup instructions on the web site.		There are some good points, though:		1.  The VeraLite unit seems well manufactured and designed.  It connected easily to my home network. It has not crashed at all - after a month's use.	2.  The Micasaverde web site that controls the VeraLite functions properly - it will do what you tell it.  (unfortunately, I rarely knew what to tell it to do!)	3.  I had great results with VeraLite controlling a Kwikset deadbolt lock - the primary reason I purchased Vera.  The Kwikset and Vera communicate very well and have never failed.	4.  I had pretty good results with VeraLite cooperating with a GE plug-in dimmable light controller.	5.  I was able to get an AEON door/window sensor to cooperate reliably with VeraLite - announcing the opening of a door.  I can find no other substitute for the AEON sensor, so one key aspect of using Home Automation is almost unavailable to me.	6.  I've had occasional seemingly random success getting the Micasaverde IP camera to work.	7.  I've used AutoHomation on my Droid phone to lock/unlock the door, view the camera, turn on the light, etc.  This interface seems to work well.		I have not yet been able to get the Aeon door sensor to collaborate with the GE light module and the MiCasaVerde wireless IP camera.  Constructing a "scene" where the opening of the door turns on the light and the camera.  I've spent over 40 hours in random attempts to install the switch, the dimmer module, and the camera in the correct order or in a scene that would achieve a seemingly simple task.		I'm retired now, so I'll keep working on it, combing through the Wiki and the Forum for hints about how to get something done.  It's a great mental puzzle if you are not into Soduku.  Frankly, I've had more success with VeraLite than I have with golf - another frustrating exercise.  I'm sure that the light will click on for me, and I'll be happy I had persevered!
1,This worked for one evening and looked like the photo on the package. But the next morning it was still glowing weakly. Apparently the light sensor that shuts these off when they are in daylight quit working. It couldn't get a decent solar charge as long as it the light were burning so it was dim for a very short while after sunset. Seller was prompt with return label and info though.
1,Worked well, shipped quickly, very compact.  This light is the same size as a mini candelabra halogen bulb which should work well for ceiling fans or other small applications.  The light is instant on and the dimming worked ok.  The color was very clear, not warm.		I did quite a bit of research to replace my halogen bulbs because they burn out every 1-2 months.  I purchased an E11 to E12 converter to use this bulb, but it did not produce nearly the amount of light that I expected or that I feel was advertised.  In the attached images I am showing this bulb in comparison to a 60W 500Lumen LED Candelabra bulb.  The 60W LED bulb was much brighter and needless to say I will not be using this bulb for my application.
1,bad quality..light is really weak
1,I really wanted to like the Flic... pushbutton automation for things on my phone. However, I struggled way too much with buggy behavior or poor design, and it never got to the point where I wanted to use or depend on it.		For instance, pair the device to my phone sucked. Sometimes it would pair, other times it would not. I also didn't care for the fact I often had to go back in and re-pair it after things like phone reboots. I want something like this to work like my phone does in my car. I get in, and it connects... no thought required... it just works. This doesn't.		Could this be a cool item? Definitely. I love the concept and something like this would be a nice alternative to NFC tags. But at least in their current iteration, it's not worth the headaches for me.
1,Cheaply made plastic.  Low quality.
1,There is very little range of movement between hot and cold, and it also varies depending on how high the flow is. A small inadvertent touch of the handle shifts it from warm to hot VERY quickly, and one can easily burn oneself due to this. It's not "unsafe", but you have to be careful when you use it----which kind of destroys the whole concept of convenience when shifting from a two-faucet system to a single-lever faucet.		I'm not sure which ones are better. It might pay to visit a Home Depot or Lowes, etc., and see which one has a greater range of motion. Whichever has the widest range from left to right would be the one I'd buy in the future.
1,Don't buy this square. I should have returned mine, but was busy and didn't.  I have a dozen combination squares, old ones and new(er) ones, from Craftsman and Starrett and Empire and several other brands.  The best of them are vastly better than the cheapest of them, but this PEC is worse than any of them.  You use a combination square constantly if you use it at all, measuring and marking and re-measuring and checking.  You need the rule to slide smoothly and easily, clamp firmly when it clamps above all else, because that's what you are constantly doing.  This square fails that test.  And if you remove the rule from any of the heads it is near impossible to get it back on, a design detail that is important to seamless flow of whatever you are doing and doubly crucial on a multi-head square like this one.  Also the set screws were bent and also not smooth.  Buyers:  buy a different one.  Maker:  make a different one.  I need a metric-marked square now but I am reluctant to buy this brand.  I wish Amazon carried the Empire squares.
1,Major pain to work with, getting it apart and putting it back together will drive you nuts
1,Arrived in non working condition - poor
1,I have a little household driver that has more power than this does. The impact part of this doesn't work. The milwakie just stops instead of hammering in or out on the bolt. I can't recommend this to anyone.
1,Works reasonable well until it breaks.  Carrier says you have to contact a dealer to get warranty support.  Every one I called wants $250-$350 to come out an replace it.  It is cheaper to buy a new one that replace this under warranty.  Deceptive.
1,It jambs, and after clearing jamb it does not work. This is second one Porter Cavle sent me and after shooting a few staples,it jammed and doesnt, work any more. I haven,t had time to send it back
1,JUNK - breaks easily
1,I burned out the hammer this was bought for before I got to use this, this attachment seems fine but the hammer was oiled and it burned out, your better off buying a bosch hammer drill and renting a big jack hammer when you need one
1,this thing is useless.  it's like some kind of electronic device on crack.
1,NOT recommended. Given that it is supported at only three points, the saw is scarily unstable when in transport mode. Even a pebble or other small irregularity on the floor threatens to upset the machine, which is quite top-heavy. If the weighty saw ever did tip over, it would be quite the calamity, likely damaging the works and also presenting a severe hazard to anyone or anything within range. In addition, the lift mechanism is not well engineered. Firm pressure on the pedal does not really summon sufficient force to lift the saw, so it must be boosted up with both hands while pressing down on the pedal. Finally, the pedal arm is too weak and bends easily. A four-wheel rolling stand would be a safer and highly preferable alternative for moving this machine around the shop.
1,Within a few days of installation, I got the phone call. Fan was not working anymore.	The temperature potentiometer(pot) was unresponsive. Changing the heat/cool mode	and running the pot up and down had no effect. The motor wasn't turning over.		After getting the return label printed and preparing a box for return shipment,	I plugged it in, one last time.. It worked!! Turning the pot would now turn	the motor off and on. Then suddenly it failed again!	Instead of turning the pot control, I pushed in on it slightly. The motor ran!	Stopped pushing and it stopped running.		It seems like a dirty wiper-arm, or a weak wiper-arm spring, inside the pot.	I turned the pot up and down about 30 times to clean the arm, no joy..		Return and refunded. Now looking for another brand that's acceptable to the end user..	This was a birthday gift and now it's pending..
1,Over in 3 years.  Wasn't used all that much in the standard table lamp that is probably then best ventilation setting I can think of.  2nd bad experience (of 2) with Phillips LED's.  It would be a very good idea to avoid Phillips for LED's.  My other ones had staggering flaws built right into the design.  This one just failed.
1,Does not close tightly.
1,Cheap imitation of a good item. Good magnifier, but otherwise, kind of useless. Sigh.
1,I plugged it in, In the dark, turned it to "0" always on. It does not power up my Christmas lights, Set it to "D" dusk in the dark does not turn on my Christmas lights. I tested My Lights by directly plugging them into the wall, they work. I took the device apart (you need special screwdrivers, they use a Anti-tamper type of screw). I just happen to have special screwdrivers just for getting around this. at any rate you can use a drill and drill out the screws just making sure you only take the head of the screw off. then there is two screws holding the board in place. there was a capacitor on the board that was not properly soldered in. 5 mins later it was soldered in correctly the device began to work. I put the device back together installing regular Phillips screws and presto ready for Christmas. this however shows these devices are improperly tested at the factory. If I were you maybe buying this from a local store so you can take it back without having to pay to send it back to Amazon for a replacement, or buy one made by another company.
1,Very disappointed. I purchased this light to function as an outdoor (semi-exposed) light source. On receiving it, I just put it through its paces in doors. When the light is one, it seems to be quite bright, very adequate for my needs.. When the light is on. The motion activation function works only occasionally. My experience is that most Chinese products have a significant failure rate. I suspect that were I to buy 6 of these, 3 would work fine and 3 would have some kind of problem. The Chinese quality control is similar to what we experienced years ago when "Made in Japan" had a different meaning. I guess now "Made in Japan" is being replaced with "Made in China"
1,they don't work. lights don't go all the way off
1,I must have gotten a defective one.  When I first opened it, I noticed the last set of balls were a little wet, so I'm wondering if I got one that had been returned.  When the hose was hooked up to it, it back sprayed out of the hose part where it screws onto it.  We tried all the settings and it did it on all of them.  Disappointed!!  Will be sending this back to get my money back.
1,Used twice before it stopped heating the water.
1,did not fit
1,I was using a prehistoric craftsmen before  Oh my god...like a hot knife through butter.	Love the quick brake stop.  UPDATE: 1 year later CORD GUARD ALREADY DRY ROTTING and cracking.  Realized PRECISE 90 DEGREE ANGLE FOR FURNITURE CANNOT BE ACHIEVED because of slight blade tilt which makes cuts for furniture (table) impossible without thin a shim.  ok for framing cuts. ELECTRIC BRAKE ALREADY SEEMS TO HAVE STOPPED WORKING.  I have used this for a total about 20 hours of cutting.  THIS IS MAKING ME RE-THINK MY TOOL PURCHASES...A GARAGE OF ALMOST ALL DEWALT TO DATE.
1,MISSING PARTS, ASKED FOR CREDIT
1,This belt sander seems to be well made, but the motor is mounted to the left of center.  This causes an unbalance which translates to uneven application of the sanding belt on the wood.  To use this sander, you must apply a torque on the handle to counterbalance this tendency.  Seems to be an old design - one I remember from the 60's when I bought my first belt sander from Sears.  I recommend you do not purchase this unit.
1,Bought it, put it in the pond, it quit after a couple of weeks. Something in the electricals. Shorted out and cut off the electricity, tripped the GFIs. So I don't know what it was. Maybe it's not supposed to run continuously, but nothing said that. And I did, ran it all day every day, and when I forgot, it would run from say 8 am day one to 10 or 11 pm day 2, lots of hours. Maybe that was too much for it. Or perhaps I got the defect that didn't get caught at assembly.
1,The unit showed up short one alligator clip with ball joint, so I guess it's not a 'Dual' unit after all. Amazon couldn't provide the missing part although they did suggest I return it for full credit or get partial credit for loss, but since it wasn't theirs they could not provide the missing part. Thanks Amazon, but the need was urgent and so I took it and the partial credit and kludged an alternative solution. The Magnifier is sort of useless and smaller then I thought it would be, maybe with a longer arm, but the rest did the job with some kludging of a second clip.
1,Absolute piece of garbage.  It hardly worked for 2 weeks before falling apart.  Considering the time one puts into searching, reading, deciding, and buying, and then returning these cheap junks, I would fine these scrupulous junk makers for making cheap garbage...
1,Broke the second day of use, returned with no problem.
1,Too small and cheap. Sent them back for a refund
1,Just bought this for my shed (had 300 watt incadescent). VERY disappointing as it doesn't shine any light directly below the light where you need it. I can't think of an application where you need light out the sides of the bulb but not below it.
1,These failed within months. I may have an incompatible dimmer switch but I don't recall any specifications for that.
1,Knife feels great in the hand, blade replacement is decent enough. Packaging was horrendous, (not sure whether that's the carriers fault or the sellers) the real killer is the offer says its for 6 knives and I only received one. Not very happy with this seller. I'll update my review if they make it right
1,I received a Milwaukee 18v Lithium-Ion drill for a birthday present three years ago.  It was lightly used for a few home improvement projects.  During the last project the battery life was short.  Recently (last week) we started tearing down a deck to put up a larger replacement.  I took one screw out of the railing and then the battery reported no charge and would no function.  It had just come off the charger.  Called Milwaukee to report that the batteries are no longer taking and holding a charge.  They told me it was out of warranty and I could buy replacement batteries.  Ridiculous!		The DeWalt I had before this drill lasted 13 years.  I just bought a replacement for the Three Year Old Milwaukee, I bought a DeWalt.
1,I got these bumpers to raise the front of the plastic seat after installing the Luxe bidet.  They did not adhear to the plastic seat and did not use them.  I found that when placing washers under the plastic seat hinges the Luxe bidet fit better.
1,Like other reviewers, I followed instructions carefully when applying to my black granite counter-top and then reapplied, but got water-like stain residues that couldn't be removed by the SCI cleaner.  Took elbow grease with soap and water than Windex to remove them and restore the shine. I subsequently had a professional come to clean and seal and he said others had told him of bad experiences with these SCI products.
1,The battery cover on the tester broke in half when I went to install a battery for the first use.  The crimper only crimps 2 out of 8 wires for ethernet, and the return period is limited, so I can't return it.  The tips don't reliably crimp with my good crimper.  All pieces of this kit appear to be total garbage. DO NOT BUY THIS.
1,This would be a good sander if it turned off when I switch it off. Unfortunately it never quite worked right when I got it and now it doesn't turn off at all.
1,Whithin 2 years of instalation the chamber rusted all the way through and started leaking. JB Weld gave me another year of service without leaks. The unit ran well and quiet untill I replaced it for new leaks, with a disposal without a metal chamber.
1,When I was looking at this, I was comparing this and the Kobalt LDM-35.  I purchased this first based on fantastic ratings and the slightly lower price. The reason why I bought this is because I am looking at very large buildings and need something to measure rooms accurately and quickly for determining square footage. I bought the 100' version (TLM99).		When I received it and used it for the first few times, I noticed that it had several very bad flaws.		1) It has absolutely no tactile feedback. The buttons are mushy, you will not notice that you've pressed the button. There's no "click" feeling when you press the button.  It is somewhat hard to press.		2) The base (bottom of the measurer) is not 100% flat because of the rubber armor and that there's a seam right in the middle of it. This is the most important part of the laser measurer.  Since I am looking at buildings that may be 100 feet long, the base has to be absolutely flat.		3)  The screen does not have any backlight whatsoever!  You need to have bright light when using it to see the numbers shown on the screen. This is not good in dim buildings or in the shade.		I can live with having no backlight. The #1 and #2 drawbacks of this unit is the main reason why I am returning it.  Imagine that you are looking at a warehouse that is 100 feet long and you have a wobbly measurer with buttons that are hard to press.  The laser will not be perfectly and at 100 feet, a slight angle change can be a huge difference. Every time I press it, the distances change because I could never get a solid footing on the wall and lack of feedback when I pressed buttons so that it can determine the distance. It kept shifting.		Today, I went to a chain home improvement store that sells Kobalt tools.  They had a Kobalt LDM-35 for $12 more ($80 vs $68) and it was a fabulous measurer. It is slightly smaller.  The buttons are easy to use, and it had tactile feedback (buttons "click" when you press it) and the base is absolutely flat with no seams that makes it wobbly.  The Kobalt even came with a holster and wrist strap!  The kobalt measurer also was backlit. You can see it in bright sun or in a dark room.  It also has a lot of other features (measurement memory, angle calculations, etc...).  The battery compartment cover is secured by a screw - they will not pop batteries out if you drop it (the Stanley battery cover is just held on by a clip)  It's also gravy that it can do 15 feet more than the Stanley.		The Stanley TLM99 measurer is going to be sent back to Amazon. I recommend the Kobalt LDM-35 laser measurer, the $10-15 extra for it is well worth it.
1,This has the typical blueish office-like cast. Ugly lighting. Threw mine away.
1,The fixtures are great, but the transformers and electric eyes are of very poor quality. Had to replace both on the two sets I ordered. The replacements ordered from Moonrays did not last a week. Order a separate transformer.
1,junk ratchet. First time I use it's broken in one size
1,This fan vibrates against the housing LOUDLY.  It isn't the blades rubbing, but the housing itself. Poor design and manufacturing.
1,This sanding disc was designed to cfut plastic. It does this?,,,,But after only two uses?  is was all through. filed itself down to the label on the disc. and this was from cutting model plasticv nothing too thick. So it should have been able to handel more than two cutting jobs or so "I thought"  well...No it didn't and it's not worth the price.		Thank You
1,limited
1,Got 10 good years from my Delta 470 model, and despite their lifetime warranty, none of the parts they sent me were able to stop it from leaking under the handle, so that was the end of that. Too bad, I liked that faucet.  Decided to try Kohler for a change.  This faucet was very easy to install, with no surprises.  I can't say I'm a fan of the pre-attached supply hoses--I hope they last. I would rather install my own stainless steel lines.  I installed it with the on/off lever to the left which is the way I think it's supposed to go.  With this orientation, the lever in the full down position (toward you) would have the temperature full hot.  I didn't think this was a good idea, so I reversed what they said was the cold water supply line to the hot one.  It looks funny if you have that lever all the way pushed back to leave it in the position to get cold water.		The way this faucet works is the lever goes side to side for volume, and front to back for temperature.  My valve is a little sticky when turning on and off, not smooth travel like every other faucet I've had.  Maybe it will relax with some use or I will just get used to it.	With the solid stream of water, I don't find it to have a splashing issue.  With the spray, I think you have to expect that it's going to splash some.  I love the pull down feature, making it very easy to rinse out the sink and fill pots.  The head does not seem to go back into the body without a little help, but seats in easily. ** I take that back, it retracts just fine.  I had to separate the hoses a little bit under the sink so it would slide freely.**		Overall I think I will be happy with this faucet.  It has enough good features to make it a practical choice.		6/13/17- Had to update my review of this faucet and unfortunately it is not good.  The chrome Bellera I bought is still performing extremely well. I purchased another one in stainless steel to install in my other condo.  Started leaking from the handle in less than six months. Asked Koehler to fix under warranty and they sent another cartridge. Leaked just the same inside a month.  Returned that one and bought another of the same model to replace it.  The new SS Bellera is leaking in exactly the same place, in two months!  No way should it need a new cartridge in that short of time.  I'm pretty handy so I inspected inside the faucet where the cartridge seats and looked for debris, etc that would cause the cartridge to leak but didn't see anything that could be the cause. I'm starting to think that there is a manufacturing defect in the SS version of this faucet. Two faucets leaking under the handle with only a few months of usage?  Not good. I will not be installing another of these faucets.
1,Get the higher end valves, I didn't know the difference.  Has plastic handle that make operating lever feel spongy and soft
1,I am unable to  leave a review because the meter  does not work. I can turn	it on and Since I paid very little for it that's it I'm just going to trash it!	I would not recommend it.
1,They bent right away cutting smaller gauge wire I have another pair from a different company I have had them for 7 years and not a messed up thing about them these one i used for a day not very happy with them
1,Received with 4 broken bulbs, too much hassle to return for credit.  Would have been nice to just have them replaced.  Bulbs do work fine though, just unhappy about breakage and the hassle to return.
1,Very dim output (see photo). The white was blueish white. The colors look good and the light can be dimmed 3 steps, but the output wasn't strong enough for my grapevine deer.		Attached is a shot using a 75 halogen spotlight from Lowes for $20 bucks. It has photoelectric eye for dusk to dawn lighting.
1,first one broke and second one now also does not work
1,Looks nothing like the picture the lamp is not a double helix, instead it is a single spiralled tube of glass
1,Very unimpressed with this sharpener, I got a better edge with a rock.
1,Very small.  Even household extension cords would be a challenge.  Description says it will house ANY two cords.  That is not the case.  There is no way you can get a heavy duty extension cord inside this housing.
1,We had a composite base water fountain that had cracks in the base and didn't hold water anymore. I tried some foam filler to seal it but that didn't work. So when I went to Lowes to look for another sealer, the sales clerk said to try this. I knew it had mixed reviews but they said if it didn't work, I could bring it back. No risk.		So I cleaned out the base, sprayed it once. It looked like it could work. It provided a even coating of rubber everywhere. I waited a day, sprayed again, and repeated the next day. Three coats, one full can gone.		I was so excited since it looked like it had sealed everywhere. Come-on! They float a boat on a screen door! It had to work for my small cracks.		Another few days of curing, just to be sure. The moment had come to fill it with water. And... out came the water from the bottom. It must have filled some of the cracks in but it still leaked in spots and I wasn't going to spend money buying another can to see if I could finish sealing it.		So, I'm sure if you used 50 cans, it might work. I can't imagine how many they used on the screen door. But for me, in the small space I tried, carefully following directions, it didn't work.
1,The rechargeable batteries in these guys do not have a high enough capacity.  They light up from dusk and stay lit for about 3 hours.  I have not tried to replace batteries.  Very disappointed.
1,Works OK if you have a hot water tank. But, it does not work if you have an on demand hot water system. It does not allow enough low to enable the hot water heater to heat the water in the loop.
1,Cheaply built
1,These are NOT self-stick.  Their description brags about how good the self stick is, but the only thing it sticks to is the paper backing that you are supposed to remove.  They hardly stick to any surface, no matter how clean or smooth.	The LEDs are nice and bright, but I will have to put them up with hot glue.

I believe Fenix makes some great products, but not very reliable. I  returned this light.
1,first of all, this remote works great, I have no complaint on this remote, I can open up my garage from a quite far distant. The reason I only gave it two stars is because it has conflict with chamberlain keypad remote. when I programmed it with my keypad remote, This transmitter will no longer work. or if I programmed it with my transmitter, the chamberlain keypad will stop working..
1,Only worked for a couple of weeks.  All three units quickly broke.  While they worked, they were fine.  But now I have only memories.  <Sigh>
1,Recieved the two flashlights lightning quick and packaged perfectly thanks to Amazon Prime and the seller, but I have to say that I was shocked at the quality of the product. The reason I bought the light was due to Streamlights great name and the fact that I have several other Streamlight products that I love, TLR-1s, TLR-2, etc. This flashlight is turned on and off by rotating the front portion of the light. Tighten the front to turn it on and loosen to turn off. The problem is that in order to turn off the light, you must loosen it to the point that it is not secured. every little bump turns it on and off, so you loosen it a little more, it seems like it wants to fall off. Definitely not what you'd expect from Streamlight. In short I can't recommend this light at all and will have to shop for a replacement. Wish I wouldn't have thrown the packaging away or I would return them, I just didn't think that I would have had a problem with a Streamlight product.
1,Does not work Amazon Echo and their is no support. It's not even clear which App you need to download or install.
1,I am not sure if someone could design a product to do a worse job at its intended purpose while still appearing legitimate.		The folks who rated this with 5 stars either work for the manufacturer, or have never worked with a good fish tape.  I've owned dozens, and still have several around.. I bought this one just in case having an extra would help me because my project required a lot of time in the most uncomfortable attic you could imagine.  (1970s Florida Home)		I read the reviews before purchasing and they were mixed, so I figured that I could spare $12 on finding out who was right.  Several people talked about there being a "trick" to getting it to operate properly.  There is a trick to getting it to operate at all, but it's still horrible.  If there is some trick beyond what I managed to figure out, its undocumented, entirely.		So, the device uses a large coiled metal "wire" with a rotary lever to extend and contract the end.  I can understand that the nature of coiled metal could make for an interesting challenge for the manufacturer.  But, they met this challenge with zero innovation.		Unwinding, or extending, the tape is absolutely impossible without relieving tension through a wind then unwind pattern.  I assumed that this was only necessary at the start of the extension process, which would have been acceptable, but in fact you have to do it about every one or two rotations.  Extend, wind back up slightly, release tension, extend, and repeat.  Still, I could live with it.  Trouble is, even with all of this it is REALLY hard to extend.  Its about like trying to open jars of jelly at each step.		The device is so tiny that you always seem to be struggling for leverage to unwind it.  I have to hold the device against myself and strain my wrist to what felt like the breaking point constantly.  Even for $12, you shouldn't have to work so hard for such a simple idea.		I figured out almost immediately that it wasn't going into the attic with me.  I used it a few times when I had enough room around me to strain through the unwinding process.. but never in places I actually needed it.  Even then, I'd unwind 8-10 ft (which was as far out as I ever got it) and just feed the wire in (as opposed to unwinding it while feeding).		In the end I busted the unit up with a sledge to just get the wire out.  Even dealing with a 25 ft cumbersome wire is better than dealing with the device.		The wire itself is nice.. just enough rigidity.. and winding the wire up is easy enough for a child.  But unwinding is just as important, and horrible.		I wouldn't buy this with YOUR money.  Find something else.
1,Only 6 months left I ran the package code and it states 6 months wow can't even get a year out of them glad I only got 2. Here is the info the site gave me when I checked the numbers on the packages Date Code on Package		2342	AVG Storage Temp (F)		70	CALCULATE	Manufacture Date	07 DEC 2012	Estimated Shelf Life	07 APR 2016	Remaining Time	6 MONTHS
1,Disturbing that that Dewalt would put out such a product with their brand name on it.  Very poor quality,  reminiscent of the earliest no-name Leatherman copies of more than 10 years ago.  At 20 dollars or less,  it has some value for an end user who has no other pocket knife or multi tool.  Not recommended unless you can find it for less than $20.
1,What a piece of garbage! Broke within two days of installation! Waste of money! Why can't they make them as high of quality as they did in the early 1990's? And why only in ugly chrome? Now without shower... Again.
1,I bought this item based on reviews. For me the bulbs burned out too quickly, but it could have been the bulbs I put in. My main issue is that the bulbs were difficult to put in. Sometimes a bulb would break in my hand while putting it in, or I would chip the ceramic casing, while putting it in, that covers the ends of the bulb after it is in place. You are not supposed to touch the bulbs with your bare hands, touching it will shorten the life of the bulb because of oils on the hands. The recepticle that holds the bulb is spring loaded, as time went on it became more difficult to get the bulbs in. Eventually the spring loaded mechanism became too loose to hold the bulb.		I replaced the unit with a light sensing floodlight; it comes on when it is dark and goes off at dawn. The bulbs can be changed with ease and I can touch them with bare hands. I can direct the two bulbs of the floodlight to provide light excatly where I need it. With the floodlight you don't have to take off, and possibly drop, a glass lens covering the bulb. It will probably be more expensive to operate compared the motion light because it will be on several hours each night.		If a person sees my house as a target from a distance, he sees it is well lit and will look someplace else. With a motion sensing type a person can get closer to my home before the light would come on. A determined intruder or vandal could easily avoid the motion sensing range and could wait until the light timed out and then proceed out of the motion sensors range.
1,Don't know what I was expecting from all the reviews on this, and most of the negative reviews were right.  This is cheap and compass is useless unless you take the knife out, maybe if i had a sense of direction.  Would save your money.  The packaging looked like something that you could get from China in the dollar store.
1,Wish these would last more than 2 years.....
1,We had one old floor register in our house with a similar pattern. It was all bent and looked horrible. It motivated me to change all of our register covers in our house with new one (not these ones!).		There was one wall register in our house, and we thought this would look good there. Being on a wall, it should get bent from people stepping on it. Simply me gently pushing it into the vent hole caused it to get bent in all sorts of ways. Each of the little metal dangly things bends with only a minor force - you could bend it with a pinky finger. It looks horrible, even after I bent them all back it still looks poor.
1,Toilet seat will not stay up, hits flush button, they don't tell you that when you read the description.  Won't buy again nor recommend.
1,The way you zero this gauge is by laying it open flat on a reference surface, i.e. jointer/tablesaw.  But when you then fold it closed by 180 degrees it reads 179.8 degrees.  Which doesn't sound like much to be off but if the gauge is used for setting up a miter/crosscut sled 90 degrees to the blade on a table saw- you have a problem.  This I found out the hard way by messing up some cabinet joints with my Leigh dovetail jig.  So, if you need to get accurate 90/45 degree angles on a table saw, invest in a high quality Starret/Woodpecker square and a high quality Incra laser etched miter gauge-i.e. 1000 HD (High Definition).  Just because it's digital doesn't mean it's accurate.  This now makes me question the accuracy of my iGaging digital cube-which I use to set up bevel angles on the tablesaw.
1,I received all the towel holders. But there were only 3 brackets for connecting all of them to the wall. So I need 5 more brackets, to finish the job. I believe someone sent them back to you, & you didn't check to see if all the brackets were there. So I have to stop what I am doing to write you this letter, & explain all this to you dummies?		  bob Hartl
1,I used to sell these for a long time a few years ago. I also used to test them out too.  I'm not that crazy about this particular item only because the design is so bulky.  You basically have this huge 6+ inch filter hanging in your face this whole time you are taking a shower.  So aesthetically, it is not very appealing.		The good news is that the filter works very well and lasts for as long as they typically say it does before needing a replacement - 6 months.  It will definitely remove Chlorine very well and probably other things that they are not willing to comment on but for what's out there on the market - there are many other designs that will fit the bill for you and last just as long for you too.		So as a comparison to other filters - I do not recommend this one.
1,Nice lamp but the light is really really soft
1,Received the product today from China.  Tool is a knockoff Klein tool and doesn't have the Klein logo anywhere on the product.  The description lists it as a VDV226-011-SEN however this product has a product # of HT-N5684R.  I am trying to return them now for a full refund without even opening.  Klein tools work but I can't take a chance on these.  Seems like a total scam....
1,Nice bit holder, but if your expecting a magnet that is useful this isn't it. By magnetic I mean that I expect the bit to pick up 2-4 screws (depending on their size of course) when I dip it into a pile of screws, This won't pick up even one. Other than that it's quite nice. 2 Stars because of weak magnet, but if that doesn't bother you I'd give it 4 stars.
1,Portasol manufactures quality product and it's clear that they tried to do the same here with the ergonomic and slick shape of the torch and material and build quality. However, this product was design to make the company's lawyers happy, not its customers. Operation is so cumbersome compared to any other torch. It's a two hand operation, you need to pull the level and push the trigger (hard spring) two clicks in and then release. To turn the flame off, again, you hold the torch with one hand and pull the trigger back (hard). It's even worth because of the trigger is not fully exposed and half of it is covered with the torch's body.		Also, my unit arrived without a manual. I couldn't figure out for example how to remove the orange base as possible with other torches. That base also stand in the way if you have a larger hand.		Bottom line, very poor ergonomic. This one is going back to amazon.
1,Nice sockets at first blush, but they use rubber washers to grip the plug.  Problem is that rubber is a loose press fit into the socket and it will stay behind on the plug you just fought half an hour to install into that coilpack tunnel conveniently hidden behind the AC pressure hose and master cyl.  Meaning you get to remove the plug because the coilpack won't fit over the plug terminal with the washer on the way.  Great fun way to help the neighbor kids expanded their vocabulary.  Pay a few dollars more and buy a proper, magnetized set, not this chintzy junk thats made in china with a bunch of shortcuts.  And if you do buy them, l suggest using a dab JBWeld to secure the rubber washers before use.
1,Could not use. Fan blade was bent into the housing and fan couldn't turn. Sent back to Amazon for a refund and bought one locally.
1,I am fairly handy so am pretty sure I followed the directions correctly but I couldn't remove a screw since the first step did not create a divot that could be grabbed onto.
1,Not really all that thrilled with this.
1,Can anyone tell me how to connect this to my Alexa Echo?  Wish I had read the reviews "before" I purchased.  Thought it would be a no-brainer, wrong!		I followed all the instructions.  Downloaded the app on my phone.  But it gets hung up with a message on my computer that says I need to 'enable' pop ups in my browser.  Well, I enabled pop ups in my browser and "Nothing" happens!  It just gives me the same message about "enable pop ups"...?????? Frustrated.		What is the secret behind getting this little gadget to work????
1,The design of these drain clog removers is fine, The problem (and reason for the 2-star rating) is the poor quality plastic they are made from. The plastic is flexible enough to follow the drain through the trap, but when I tried to pull it out, it broke between the handle and the part that actually enters the drain. Needed a different plastic that had a higher tensile strength. Ended up taking the drain apart anyway (which is the right way to fix the clog properly) to retrieve the broken drain clog remover tool. Great design, poor quality materials.
1,shipping costa way too high
1,These bulbs don't work in window candle fixtures.  Maybe it's something different with the base.  They screw into the socket but the bulbs won't go on.  Doesn't matter if they don't work they are of no use to me and I wasted $38.
1,Cheap plastic that puts out minimal light, almost useless. For an under counter light, why do you supply an extremely black cord? This is junk, buy something else. The title of the unit says it's stainless steel, but it's cheap plastic that's colored like SS. Returning item.
1,Extremely watery. Tried to use it on a wall and it just drips even with a very small amount. Can't imagine it staying on a chair leg as advertised any better. Not very shiny either. I was hoping for similar to a mirror finish. Just kinda a sparkle.
1,I've already rated this item.
1,so far aim disappointed safe does not open,no batteries included,how is it supposed to open when the batterie compartment is inside the safe,factory code not working,key does not unlock it either and i needed it today to store important stuff away. Instructions are complex and unclear and of course you can get any body on the phone tim monday
1,I've run 3 4.5' grinders now. A fixed speed Ryobi-most basic model from HomeDepot-first one had axial play, but the replacement works fine. (smooth and sounds like it should) A VS Kawasaki, the $37 one. I thought it was junk, was really, truly incredibly loud like jet turbine, had to wear earplugs just to run unloaded, and made very discouraging sound- loud clattering even under load, not just spin-down, didn't like switch. Returned it. So now the Hit. Very nice, impressive, quiet (for these) smooth. Nice switch. My one problem...it's built too heavy lol. Even the nuts are beefier than the others'. Which is surprising. I was like, really? those nuts need to be THAT thick? I guess when you have it full speed that's 13 amps and if you lean into it...idk. Heavier than I was hoping, at least 3/4 lb more or so. It weighs about 5.2 lbs or so with cord and no guard or nuts. The Ryobi, bless it's cheap little heart, weighs about 3.4 lbs dressed same. So about 1.7 lbs difference or so! Very noticeable, I'm no strong man, like control and finesse often. Doesn't matter for job where are resting tool on work horizontal, too bad that's not all. For other jobs is a bit much for me. 3.5-4 just seems right. Weight is part of why I want 4.5 inch- I'm talking about some one-handed work too, yeah and I leave the guard off (for grind or cut, not for flap-disc ouch! trimmed guard for that). Now I'm left still looking, but tempted to try to keep this in spite of weight. I don't need quite 13 amp, but I sure want this build quality. Recommend avoid the Kawa. I didn't even try getting a replacement. I didn't see how one miss-assembled part (like on the first Ryobi) could have helped the Kawa much. Even if it didn't clatter it was still ridiculously loud. WHAT?...I SAID IT IS RIDICULOUSLY LOUD! I		I didn't really find it very underpowered ... Most any electronically 'slowed' device is going to have proportionally LESS power as you make it slower.  But I think some of the fancy one, I think at least the 12amp Makita, has a feature where is adds power to try to maintain speed. I haven't tried that I bet is speeds up and down a bit randomly. I think the 12amp Hitachi does the same thing but havn't run it under load yet. It's not a transmission that keeps motor running full. If you think it's weak when you have it on full speed I suppose that might be different. This and any VS grinder are not polishers. They will all have less torque at lower speeds. Staring with a 13 amp one will help of course, but it's still not geared for it. Go look at polishers they are GEARED to run at lower RPM. If you were using a polisher as a grinder you would probably complain that it doesn't spin fast enough.  You turn this grinder down when you NEED LESS power and speed. And as always a sharp tool does the work, not brute force. If you really fell you must 'lean' into your work, you either have the wrong or worn/dull disc, or you are impatient. Pushing only gived marginal work speed gains, with less control and safety, and sometimes dramatically shorter tool  life. Not saying anyone does, but always better to not blame a tool for failing after abusing it, embrace the eloquence, convenience, and savings of adopting practices that preserve tool life. You will get things done just as fast or faster, and just as well or better.
1,If you need accurate measurements, move along and get something else. It seems to be fine under 3 feet for accuracy, but any distance measurement only randomly provides a level of accuracy you can make cuts against.
1,Seats a kind of large for the faucet
1,Cheap and didn't even open when I tried them. Returned as quickly as possible.
1,Straight out of the box it would not work properly with a brand new alkaline aa battery, I tried a few different ones. It will go into firefly fine but flickers randomly in low. Switching into high mode it will flash then go somewhere near the low power or just turn off. It is a little more reliable if you switch modes with the head...	I emailed thrunite about this and they replied telling me to stick small tweezers or scissors into the tiny holes in the chip inside the the head and turn it to see how the light work and if that doesn't help then return it to amazon and reorder in a month	I did attempt to fix the light but that chip seems to be glued in the head or something. Could not get it to turn.	Lucky for me I had a nitecore 14500 lithium battery that was in my foursevens qpa. Popped that in the t10 and now it works fine.(still won't work properly with an alkaline)  I bought this light so I could use regular aa batteries in a pinch. Since it does work with 14500s i will keep it instead of dealing with the return and reorder process.	Anyways, the firefly mode is fantastic. Lower than the moonlight mode on any of my three foursevens lights. Low is fine and high is pretty bright.  It is mostly flood, doesn't project very far but it will light up my whole back yard on high where the qpa will light up the neighbors house three times further. My olight i3e eos  (black) powered by 1 aaa shines farther than the t10.	I know this all sounds bad but I do like it. Especially the deep pocket clip and memory. The mode spacing and output are fine as long as your not trying to spot something kind of far away with it. Its great for walking the dog and should be good for camping. The only thing I really wish it had was momentary on but none of my lights with a recessed tail switch do that.  It will tailstand and the defuser works well. The neutral white tint is nice and a first for me. Overall for $20 it's a nice package I just wish mine worked on the lower end of the advertised working voltage.	After carrying this light daily for over a month it has been 100% reliable with a nitecore or olight 14500 protected cell
1,Not too good.  I wouldn't buy this if I could do it all over again.  It's a nice idea, but it just doesn't work very well.  I used it outside to pick up leaves and other small tree things that fall on the cement.  I have to go over the same spot about three times for it to be effective.
1,I am a do it yourself person and usually ends up with tools for every project.  The project for which this was purchased was putting in 30 can lights throughout our house.  Looking back at it, I should have gone with something that can cut holes quickly and without creating a mess....anyway....this tool is good for marking a circle in the drywall but it doesn't have the ability to cut all the way through.  I ended up using a drywall saw on every hole.  Useless tool in my opinion.
1,This is a very bright light but it's very fragile. Once the bottom switch switch plate broke around the screws, the company sent a new one in a few days. Now it fell about 18" onto soft dirt and the part of the handle that the screws for the switch go into broke into many pieces so the entire outer case needs to be replaced. Think I will just silicone it in. This light is just too fragile for daily shop use if there is a risk of dropping it.
1,Water "PROOF" may be a little of an overstatement. Water resistant maybe but that's iffy too. So something being water proof means that I can do anything with it and water but I take it swimming and it fills with water and that's the electronics in it. Was great up until I tested the water proof bit, and then it was kinda worthless.
1,It broke so soon. The battery went dead,  replaced it now it won't work.
1,I purchased a product clearly labeled "Milton Industries Inc. S-760 HI-Flo V-Style 1/4-Inch MNPT Brass Plug" and received a product called S-760-1 Steel Plug.  Steel plugs are significantly cheaper to purchase than brass and they corrode.  I returned the first shipment hoping it was a fluke and received the same steel plugs as an exchange item.  Amazon needs to get this corrected.  You are likely not going to receive brass plugs, but steel instead.		The V-style fittings are fantastic and the improvement over M and T fittings is very noticeable with high-consumption tools like impacts and grinders.  You won't regret swapping for the V fittings, just don't count on getting brass fittings by purchasing this item.  If you don't mind steel and paying more than you have to, order away.  Hopefully Amazon will fix this issue and some brave soul who ordered these will be able to let us all know when they start shipping what they say they are again.  Good luck!
1,Pictures of this Dremel Model 220 inside the Owner's Manual only show use of this device as a flex shaft hanger.  That's because it is not possible to use this device as a drill press for a flex shaft.  HORRIBLE MISREPRESENTATION IN THE ITEM DESCRIPTION!		Assembly instructions are worse than horrid - they are downright erroneous.  It took two of us over two hours to figure out how to put this together.  Even the pictures are wrong (for example:  showing nuts outside the device when they should be place inside).		I was using my oven door for a flex shaft hanger.  Now I still have to use the oven door for a flex shaft hanger because this dratted item WILL NOT WORK as a hanger unless you screw it to a table.  No way will it work in any manner with a flex shaft handpiece.		If you think this is an item that will help you, think again.  I am going to see if I can send this back.
1,The post on the back of the first light stripped out immediately when I tried to use nylon lock nuts instead of the cheap nuts that are included. Otherwise the light turned easily and wouldn't stay in place on the back of my motorcycle. I'll keep the second light for a rainy day project.  Do yourself a favor and pay a little more for a better product. Only good side to this experience is that I only paid $8 and change.
1,CAUTION:  Be sure your old harp base will accommodate this type of harp.  The  bases on my lamps have non-replaceable harps so these are useless to me without finding some bases for them.  I did not notice that these had no base!
1,I used this strip as a night light in my den.  It was on approx. 7 hours per day.  After one year it just totally quit.  All lights out.  For the price I would have expected a longer life span.
1,I bought 2 of these for guys at work to use and one is not able to have the combination set.	the other is still working great
1,LEDs were not consistent in color, some are dimmer than others. Some LEDs burned out after first start up.  Bad for me since the lights were imbedded in a glass block wall. Good thing it is that the use is  only a novelty and not needed to be on all the time.
1,Yes this helmet protected my eyes from the arc, but everything else was black, even at the lowest setting.  Oh, and the delay gets longer as the battery dies.  And, the battery is sealed inside the filter element.  So once the battery dies, you're out a welding helmet. Spend the money, and get a Miller or Speedglas.
1,I've been using a scroll saw for 30+ years. After reading the stories about Flying Dutchman blades I finally decided to try them.  Some break when I install them on my DeWalt saw. The others wander through the wood despite my best efforts. The other brands I use provide far better service. The Flying Dutchman thicker blades do a pretty good job or rough cutting my carving blanks.
1,Cons:	-it is SO dim that it produces so little light that it's barely useful		Pros:	-the clip is big so it's the only clip lamp I've found that work on my oddly-shaped, thick work desk.
1,Sent a not quite 5" globe with a sticker on box stating that it is 8" diameter. It is also not as pictured: electrode is a peace sign.
1,Didn't work, returned it.
1,With so many great reviews, I thought it was a no-brainer to order and use these hanging strips.  I have some light canvas prints to hang but waited until the painter was able to complete his painting.  (Have the entire inside repainted after living with builders' grade flat paint for five years.)  So, today I got to tackle the art work.  Was very frustrated because, even after following the directions closely, the hold was questionable.  After having them up for only a few hours, I could see they were beginning to loosen; so, I decided to remove them rather than risk them falling and getting damaged.  I see there are some other reviewers who may have had similar experience with a "bad batch" of these.  Although I'm tempted to return them, am too busy getting the house back in order.  Just want to say....buyer beware....apparently not all of these are created equal.
1,I was exceedingly disappointed with this blade, I had 8 cuts to make on 2" square tubular steel, the blade quite cutting on the 3rd cut, not even completing it. The cutting tips had dulled completely.	Advertised as having titanium/carbide tips.	Complete waste of money and time.
1,Very difficult to load caulk in the narrow zip bags. I found it pretty useless. I read and followed the instructions.
1,I will never buy this item again
1,seen to work okay, but you can tell they have been used before..
1,Battery enclosed in plastic housing. Plastic housing is brittle right out of the box. The part of the housing closest to the electrical leads broke and I had to press the piece back toghether and super glue it. Now it's a 1 piece battery again.		***UPDATE***	The plastic clips that hold the battery to the tool are broken. The battery now disengages from the leads on the tool because it will not hold firmly in place. I am sorry however the over all rating must now be a zero for this battery. I recommend buying the Milwaukee brand battery instead.
1,I used this with my router combined with the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Porter-Cable-4216-Super-Jig-Dovetail-jig-4215-With-Mini-Template-Kit/dp/B000HGL59M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Porter-Cable 4216 Super Jig - Dovetail jig (4215 With Mini Template Kit)</a>.  I have to say I was less than impressed. The sawdust output was a bit diminished, but not significantly.  Also, the addition of a vacuum hose made the router harder to handle.  The hose almost pulled my router off line several times.		Perhaps if you had a shop-central vacuum system this would work better.  It ended up being more aggravation than it was worth in this application.		I still hope to test it out on some other applications, such as edge routing. Maybe I'll be able to arrange the hose so it pulls less.		If I had to buy it again, I'd probably save my money.
1,"Alloy" huh, the body/ housing of the fan is attractive and shiny, but the fan blades arrived dinged up and are made of an OSB or composite cardboard.		The frosting has irregularities and is not even throughout.		Not impressed with the quality at all.
1,Worked great for a month, loved the button function, not a cycle, but an off. Problem started after a month, new batteries were put in on a friday, and dead on Monday after no use over the weekend, happen twice, and no it was not left on.
1,they are like a flashlight , do not shut off and on , no motion sensor , like indicated
1,Returned.
1,It was advertised as Beige in color. It is definitely not Beige. It's more yellow/gold. I can't use it so had to get a different one. I wasted my money on their false description.
1,I purchased 6 of these switches in 2013 to use as safety switches for hallway and stair lights.  After about 6 months I noticed one of the switch lights was flickering.  Now, 2 years later, all 6 switches have flickering safety lights.  The switches themselves still work fine but it's disappointing that the internal lamps are such poor quality, especially in the era of LEDs (which these obviously are not).  I haven't investigated if the lamps are replaceable but regardless, I would not buy these again.  When I get around to replacing them I will likely avoid Leviton all together.
1,Two days after I installed the device, someone kicked the front door in. The Morning Industries deadbolt was dead on the floor. Since I had reinforced my door jamb (a common place for failures) the bolt sheared off and lay on the floor. Looking at the bolt, it is secured by a very small shaft, at the end. That is what failed. This big bolt was just a fairy tale, held together with bailing wire. Do not protect yourself or your loved ones with the false security of this low security deadbolt. It looks good on the outside, but had a heart of silly putty. Stear clear. I would have not given it a star at all, but did not think this possible.  The response from the company was that this was not a high security device. RIGHT!
1,After purchasing two D batteries and installing them, the pump didn't work.  Not sure what was wrong with it, but I wouldn't try one again.
1,Failed after two months of use. Began to chirp every few minutes, regardless of battery status.
1,On/off levers are too small.
1,Worn these 3 times and one finger is already splitting open
1,did not fit ladder.  poor design - why not make this fit all models????
1,This LED light is being used to illuminate the entire width(100 feet) and height(25 feet) of a 2 story house. The light is positioned 25 feet from the center of the house and just 2 feet off the ground. Using ONLY 1 55 watt light sufficiently illuminates the entire front of the house. The fixture appears to be built of high quality. At this time, the light is just 1 week old. If it fails in the next 2 years, will update my review.	**** UPDATE 07/11/2017 -  It failed in 12 months. Bought another one, it failed in 14 months. Not happy with these. Won't order again.
1,Did not work when I got it. Package arrived with scotch tape on it, and red paint on the laser towards the side that faces the blade, indicating to Me I got a returned item. Giving the benefit of the doubt I installed it just to check. Did not work; Changed batteries, still did not work.  Disappointed to say the least. Hope others from this seller didn't have this happen to them.
1,So my favorite leather gloves, Wells Lamont 1140L, are no longer available.  I worked through my last pair and ordered these as the next best substitute.  Problem is, these are not Wells Lamont gloves, which might not have been that big of deal if they were not so poorly made.  I am pretty sure that these are deerskin, not cowhide.  It is a softer, more comfortable leather, but it wears out much quicker (in about a week of demolition work on the first pair).  Obviously I wore the gloves as the return costs were prohibitively expensive and the seller refused to pay return shipping.  That is what really got me riled up.  If this was an honest mistake, take them back.  Now I feel like it is a big deal that they are mislabeled since the seller (HTW) does not seem interested in making the situation right. On the up side, Amazon refunded the entire purchase price when i filed a claim.  So maybe you should order these fake gloves, file a claim, and get a pair of junk gloves for free!
1,None of the photos or description let me know the inside of the male end was not round and I could not use it.
1,After digging and fighting with the installation and setting up all the lights on another set made by the same company they worked great one night, then the power pack went. This was second set and the power pack went after installing the first light. I'm ripping them all out and they're all going back. Save yourself! Save the frustration and your blood pressure and spend your money on something else.		Update: I uninstalled the lighting today and noticed that the wire had been previously used, there were the tiny puncture marks from previous installation (not mine) and it appeared that the wire had been shaved a bit in places as if someone had had trouble on a previous install and the wire (and maybe more of the kit) had been returned and then put back into circulation. I am returning two sets, but I have to say it concernes me that they will just put these sets right back in the warehouse and resell them.
1,Impossible to use solo. Need help from a friend. VERY heavy. Wants to pinch your fingers. Returned it the first day I had it. Did not feel safe!
1,You can not use them much, if not, the metal they have inside will break.		No puedes usarlos mucho, si no,  el metal que tienen dentro se romper&aacute;.
1,DO NOT BUY FOR LSx engines.	The extension is too long.	Fine quality wrench, for my application it's worthless though.
1,Shur edge works far far better and much cheaper.  I tried a few other tools an the shur lined is the best I have found.  http://amzn.com/B000WOMYIU
1,These gloves are cut resistant and are acceptable for their purpose, but they have some problems. The fingers are very short compared with the body of the glove and the stated size is based on Asian hands, not American. I normally fit into large leather gloves, but bought the extra large in these. They are quite snug on me, especially the fingers, plus the fingers are too short. My wife wears large women's gloves and they fit her fine, except for the short finger length. Yes, the fingers are short on her, too.		Can they be used? Yes. Will they protect from minor accidents? They should. Will they take away some dexterity in the process? Yes; all gloves do... these a little more than others. I will be on the lookout for better gloves now that I have tried these. I would not buy these for someone as a gift.
1,This item is rated at 330 lbs and lower step bent with someone at 290 .  If you require one for a heavy person I donot recommend this stool.  Other than that it seems to be a good product.
1,It would be the perfect solution for providing light on a camping trip with young children if only it lasted longer.  Even on low, the operating time was less than an hour.  I sent it back.
1,These may be fine if they fit... My 1" recliner feet are tight on these and don't seem to stay in place. I'm afraid these will crack/split or come out while using my recliner and ultimately damage my floor.		I may try a larger size but I also don't want my recliner feet to slip in the larger size.
1,Got this for my sink. A little small but still works. However Wish the holes could be a bit bigger because the water drains out slowly. Even if bigger feel it'll catch the hair and anything too big from going down the drain.
1,Horrible reliability.  I have other LED lights outdoors in Malibu fixture... they're all fine.  These were a tad cheaper and a total waste of money because every single one of them failed in less than a year.  They last from 5 months to 12 months and then they quit working.		If I could give this less than one star I would.		Our power is great and in a large home with lots of lights (I'm a lighting freak) I don't have any other bulb that goes out like this one.		Don't be fooled... don't buy these, they are horrible horrible bulbs.
1,I would likely have rated this item at 4-5 stars if I didn't have so many defective ones with broken arms. In addition, I may have rated it better if I didn't need exactly 100 spikes. I thought I was receiving higher quality product as there are many other sellers with similar items at much lower price; however, while this may be true, the quality control really needs improvement. If you need exactly 100 spikes like myself, be aware that you may receive 5-6 defective ones and may need to improvise.
1,it doesn't work
1,Not a good fit for the older jet 14. Needs a much larger square nut. Too bad, as a very low price upgrade to the kit would make it worthwhile. I sent it back and spent more on the Iturra design setup.
1,It works, but for the most part I'm not happy with the operation.	1) It starts with the most bright, but too tight light	2) You have to go though all modes to turn off		Most lights are much more convenient with just one button.
1,Hard to understand the high ratings given the poor quality of these tools.  The end nippers and wire clippers are dull ... as in too dull to cut  even thin electrical wire leads.  And in truth, run a finger along an edge and find that they are rounded and smooth.  These were the components I really needed, and they are unsuitable for the task to which they have been designed.
1,i shouldn't have had to discover that i have to buy this separately, like i mentioned above.		it should haver been a little more visible for people to determine that there is no battery.
1,Really, this driver is awful. Thing feels like it's filled with cement in your hands. Would make an extremely effective police baton or sledge hammer. There's not too many pro's for this driver, well only one actually. The soft grip on the sides are comfortable at times when the cheap plastic is not touching your hands and the bits don't rattle around in the holder all day. But that leads to another issue, the bits are extremely long so you are only limited to those bits that are included in the handle. This may not be a problem for some, it would make a decent enough household driver for those who wouldn't know the difference between a quality tool and a dollar bin one... However, for those that turn wrenches for a living that go through bits like a bag of cheetos this creates a massive problem. Also, good luck finding an apex bit for it, went to Lowes/Home Depot/Ace today with no luck. In fact, there was not a single accessory or replacement part available whatsoever. I think there's a reason for that, reason being they realized the faulty design and cheap quality of the tool. I went back to my $8 Husky after an hour and a half or so. There's no quality gained in the excess money you pay for this, in fact it's quite the opposite. If you're looking to spend this much for a driver, go up 10 bucks and get a Williams. For those that turn wrenches for a living, suck it up and get a Snap-On or Wera.
1,Junk another crap product from China
1,One leg of Lutron does not know where the other is going. Total fault with LEDs, does not work with low power LEDs completely, requiring incandescent ballast. Lost a lot of time with one, returned, bought another just to find the bottom line that this product is a ***crap***. Fun is that the LEDs used are dimmable OK with all manual cheaper dimmers from GE, Levitron, and even Lutron itself (Diva model), but do not work with these $100 Caseta Lutrons. Additionally at low brightness switch make lamps to flicker which tells how cheapy its design is. And even do not try to make HDR pictures under such lamps. In short, avoid this old design junk. By the way cheaper Levitron dimmer is much much better, works with all LEDs, and does not flicker causing you brain damage and does not turn into garbage with the strong white and dark bands your HDR pictures.
1,Larger and more cheaply manufactured than I expected, for this price.  Feels plastic-y and fragile.  If I'd held one in my hand, first, I'd never have purchased it.
1,This thing has a HUGE diameter! I doubt it will ever work for any personal uses. Very much an industrial lock.
1,These things are *horrible*.  We have 8 recessed sockets in the ceiling of our kitchen that use this size bulb, so I bought a 6-pack of these.  I should have just set the money on fire; it would have given longer-lasting illumination in the room.  Two of the six bulbs burned out within a week.  Two others within a month.  The GE bulbs I previously purchased at Wally World tend to last ~6 months, so a lack of reliability with these bulbs is assuredly an issue.		I wouldn't give a pair of stained skivvies to have another truckload of these pieces of junk.  Never again!
1,Didn't like this product, even though it's made by Snappy from whom I've purchased other items. This countersink set did not perform well due to the fact that it does not leave a very good quality hole but has a lot of tear out. I've adjusted my drill press from very slow to very fast with no difference. I don't use them and have returned to to the cheap  one i used before. These drill bits are 2 fluted while the ones I normally use are 4 fluted. I think that's the problem. When you plug screw holes with wooden plugs, tea routs glaringly show up when stained.
1,***Purchased/Fulfilled/ Sold by: "Pink popcorn".*** Also I think going by Seller "Jackie Chan".		Very disappointed. I thought this was vinyl as in each branch was die cut - but it's like a silk screened image on clear plastic. Very cheap, not at all what I was looking for. Not even bothering to use it. GoodWill, here it comes!
1,same as for the large
1,I purchased this with the intent of using it to rip 2x lumber.  First, for many pieces of lumber, the base plate of the saw is too wide to make this attachment useful.  For other sheets of wood, it doesn't extend far enough.  90% of the time, I end up building a fence out of clamps and pieces of 2x that are lying around and that works just fine, if not better than this.
1,This used to be a decent USA-made product, with a 6" arrestor as shown in the product photo. New ones are made in China, with a 1-1/2" arrestor. They are now only marginally effective, not nearly as good as the old ones. Disappointing.		**UPDATE 01-17-2015**		Well it went from being marginally effective for 5 weeks, to total failure. I removed this miserable POS, then installed a Watts 3/4" water hammer arrestor. Cost about $75, including $30 of brass pipe fittings purchased from my local big box home center (the orange one.) Yes not cheap, but pipes are now silent.
1,Torchstar is knowingly selling a product with a deficient photocell.  They've been advised, have not made corrections, and should be on the hook for the reimbursement of professional installation when customers pay to have junk installed.  Blinkers have had to be remedied by customers: "placed 1/2" diameter x 1/2 long black soft PVC tubing over the eye (photocell) acting as a shield." "I took some black craft foam and cut a piece to make a tube to go around the photo cell. Works great now.  It's time for Amazon to step in, remove their 'Amazon's Choice' designation, and take it out of their inventory until the product is provided with a photocell that works properly.  In assessing reviews of this type of lighting currently being offered on Amazon it's clear that product coming from China is lacking in quality with premature failure and defective photocells being a primary concern.
1,Doses not work, can't get it to split our wood even when shorter then 18 inches!	Really dissatisfied, I can split better with and ax or splitting mall . The handles bow too. Diffenatly not strong enough to to do the job.
1,Better buying from big box store if you can. Size was too Bulky.  I have US house wiring and tried to retrofit existing wall socket. Wound up tossing out. Maybe fits Europe better ?
1,I own the 1st Gen of the 6-watt 3000k version and love it. I want to install another set of track light in the living room and I wanted to order another set of bulbs. Unfortunately the one I had (shown in pic) is no longer available. This 2nd gen claimed to be 6-watt 3000k so I expected it to match well with the first Gen.		Well, I was wrong. Upon opening, I noticed the 2nd Gen is much lighter than the 1st Gen (same price from 2 yrs ago). The 1st Gen is heavy, felt like a metal construction with heatsink attached around the rim of the bulbs. This 2nd Gen is light and flimsy with nothing but plastic on the rim. The color is obviously cooler than the first Gen. I tested them using custom WB with my dSLR and found out the 1st Gen is 3100k and the 2nd Gen is at 3300k, which is pretty blue.		The worst is the buzzing noise when I have them dimmed down between 20-70% bright. It also blinks once every hour or so. I NEVER had this problem with the 1st Gen. The only good thing is that it is a hair brighter than the 1st Gen. I don't like these so I ordered the 8-watt 2700k version. They are solid made, bright and wide but then they are much warmer, so they don't match the rest of the lighting I have in the kitchen/living room. I have no option but stuck with these lights now. Big disappointment on Triangle bulbs.		[UPDATE]: After a few days of installation and monitoring, I changed my review to 1 star because I noticed these LED flashes (not flicker but blink once every 5-10 mins). This has NOTHING to do with my dimmer switch because it is the same switch that I used for the First Gen of these LED and I never had problem in the past 2 years. I'm returning these LEDs.		[UPDATE #2]: I contacted Triangle Bulbs and they were nice enough offer me a replacement to the First gen bulbs that they still carry at their warehouse. I sent back the 2nd Gen and new ones came in after a week. I open the box and realized these "left over" first-gen bulbs are all opened-box/customer returns bulbs. Anyway, I hooked them up and they match my excising first-gen bulbs from 2 years ago. Yes they are not as bright and warmer. But they are quiet and no flickering. I only wish I was replacing with new first-gen, not bulbs that have potential problems. Anyway, I do appreciate they efforts.
1,The round nose pliers are bent		The broad nose pliers had metal flashing preventing them from closing properly		The side cutters were made with the cutting edge off center, I'm amazed they can even make that mistake		The packet of silica gel that was packed with it exploded during shipping so none of them will open or close smoothly
1,Changing my review from 5 stars to 0		Worked for about 2 hours total.
1,kind of cheap but inexpensive so maybe not a bad deal
1,So I dismantled the sprayer from the bottom--took off the metal disc, then pulled out the screen. From the top, I took off the rubber seal, unscrewed the thread adapter, then took a pair of long-bladed scissors and pushed out the inner plastic disc with the 1/8" hole--that was the culprit causing the mess. Reassembling was easy enough although I did bend the screen a little to get it back into place but was able to straighten it. Pop the metal disc back in, screw it into the faucet and it works fine. I did have to add my own rubber gasket to the top of the adapter to stop the leak from the faucet, but I think this is due to faucet design. This is the reason for the four-star review rather than five stars. I shouldn't have had to work that hard. This sprayer replaced a Faucet Queen (which I have also ordered), and unless they have very recently changed their design, I will not have this issue with their product.		Updated review: I have had this sprayer less than one day and am downgrading to one star. Every time I try to swivel the sprayer, it pops out of the adapter. Whether this is due to my earlier removal of the plastic insert or a design flaw,I can't say but it shouldn't be this hard. I would have sent it back, but from a time and money standpoint it would be a loss. When I get the Faucet Queen sprayer I ordered, this will go in the trash.
1,I bought this drill press because of the specs, brand name and woodworker features.  Assembly was ok with the exception of the light, which has a tiny fragile plug.  I had to cut the plug off and splice the wires. I thought more of the brand than apparently Delta does.  Its just another Chinese drill press, even if the metal work is ok you are still stuck with the electrics which is certainly inferior to U.S.  Save your money and go to harbor freight or northern tools.  I see little difference in performance and a lot of difference in price.
1,Didn't work at all.
1,I bought this product at Home Depot, not Amazon..  I was initially pleased with it after a couple of uses, the built-in LED light is a really great feature, but the third time I pulled it out for use I noticed the little metal connector that the replacement tips attach to had melted itself partway off the cheap plastic that the body is made up of, making the tips wiggle to the point where the soldering iron is unusable (and frankly dangerous).		Absolutely do not recommend this for anyone.
1,Said it was compatible to my craftsman, but didn't work at all.  Returned it.
1,....on the item detail page, it has two(2) images of a white cube, so we expected white.  however, we received beige.	in retrospect, we looked at the item detail page again and though two (2) images are white, it says grey at the bottom of item detail page.  however, again, we received a BEIGE cube adaptor, but needed a white for an eye level white outlet.		 bottom line - on item detail page, two (2) pictures of item are white, description at bottom says grey, yet, you receive beige.	  not pleased with this experience with this item or the seller that posted the item detail page.	  recommend purchasing another.	thanks for listening, deke  :-)
1,I plugged this in to test it took it out ttoday plugged it in it lit up them it  burned out  Bought it last month
1,Terrible color.
1,I like the keyless entry but I can't use it with my door because it is a year older than the keyless entry can be used for, sad
1,mine do not work.  period...  what a bummer.
1,Not as large as the ones I used in the military (3"x5"), but more compact and I thought would be better. However, when I opened it, I found that this one has a blemish. I first thought it was something on the glass, but upon closer examination, I found that it's UNDER the glass (or the backside of it). It probably won't interfere with what it's supposed to do, but for over $18, I expected something of much better quality.
1,The first time I turned them on ,which was just recently as I live in the north and wanted them fro summer, they worked for one day!!
1,This is garbage!!!	DO NOT BUY!!	Every one burned out in minutes to days.
1,The plastic that holds the body of the Dremel is so flimsy it wobbles back and forth, creating really rough cuts.
1,This is ENTIRE BS...  Ordered it, was supposed to be 8 conductor, and I got TWO conductor wire.		DO NOT BUY!!!!!!
1,One would think that if it works with Fluorescent light it would work with CFL/or LED. Not the case. Won't respond to any commands. This products are a work in progress AND that are bulky.
