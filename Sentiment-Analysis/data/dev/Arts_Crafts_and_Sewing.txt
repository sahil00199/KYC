0,Love this!. I took white clay and rolled it in the glitter and glue. Made little rondelles. They look like sparkling marshmallows..
0,Paper and guidelines are great. Can't stand the "fanboy" name though - women draw comics too dammit.
0,I am so glad I got this new threader! The one I had was not working good. This one is so nice and works much better than the old one.
0,Great card embellishments
0,This is exactly the size that best matches the size of the eyes in eyepins. Easy to work with the tool and the resulting loop. Excellent!
0,Great can't wait to start putting pictures.
0,I found out long ago that this is a brand I can trust. The images are sharp and clear. The quality is unmatched. Just sticking to what I know.
0,Received and in use.
0,Well, its a tracing pad. I use it for calligraphy and it seems to be holding up well. The ink doesn't bleed through the paper.
0,Excellent to do bussiness, I recommend
0,Wish they were more spaarkly
0,The details are crazy. They are one sided. But the are gorgeous. I make them into earring And people LOVE THEM!! I get comliments all the time. Will def be buying more.
0,I didn't know  what to think when I ordered this set. Will the kids enjoy it? Will it be a fun project? Will the markers actually work? Will is be hard to do or really messy?		The reality was, this was a fun project, the markers works just as well as store bought markers (same construction) and the mess was minimal as I was the one who poured the ink.		Is there opportunity to make a giant inky mess? Yes, but that pretty much comes with the territory with any ink/paint project.  By me doing the project with the kids, there was virtually zero mess and also very little clean up.  Just be sure to do this project on a space that isn't harmed by washable marker ink.  (Unfinished wood floors, upholstery, etc.)		After figuring out where everything went, the project just zipped along.  The most confusing aspect was the marker parts onboard storage, which ended up being unnecessary as we went through the entire kit in one sitting.  A few details about the kit:		* Makes 16 markers.	* Includes two cardboard marker holders (8 per box) that can be colored and labeled with the child's name.  Works great with two kids or less.	* Very easy to measure the ink, and assemble to the markers.	* Included inks are Red, Yellow, Blue which means you basically get markers of those colors plus shades of green, orange, and purple.  Would be nice to have some variety, but it's also plenty to fill a child's box with 8 unique colors.	* Plenty of ink to make a variety of colors also allowing for a child's preference of certain shades. E.g. if a child's favorite color is blue, you won't run out of blue ink if you make more than a couple different blues, though you will if you try to make 8 different blue markers.	* Maker casings are clear so you can see you custom colors - pretty neat, and included stickers to label them doesn't entirely cover the housing.  A smart decision in my humble opinion.		If I had a gripe, it's that with only three base ink colors, you are somewhat limited in the number of shades you can get from the set.  Still what you do get is a great start to making your markers own and hopefully there are refill sets that expand on the number of colors you can make.		In the end my 7yo daughter said this is the best Crayola project we have done together.  In summary, if your children like coloring with markers AND enjoying making things/doing projects, I would highly recommend this set.
0,Works as it should. nice and smooth so it does not catch on anything. I also have NOT managed to accidentally poke through any corners with this so I am happy with it =)
0,Perfect, thank you.
0,Perfect for what I needed.  Doesn't feel flimsy at all, surprising.	The plastic coating is firm and won't come off very easy.	Know your gauge though, this stuff is thin, but it's going onto my HO layout	in which case this could serve as a garden hose almost!		It's exactly what I expected and a bit better.
0,I received this on time not wobbled or rolled. Perfectly flat. It is a great price for this may! !! I am excited to use this larger may for my larger vinyls! !!
0,Exactly what I expected, soft and pretty.
0,Good for all to use - Used these in my classroom for projects and the paper was easy to work with and the quality great.  A lot of fun
0,Great Strong Floating Locket it is very lovely and get a lot of complements on it every time I wear it.
0,Works great for what I need!
0,This sock yarn is great to knit with, and is great for baby clothes as well as it's intended use of socks.  You can even make a shawl with it.
0,Super sharp. I have rheumatoid arthritis and these help so much with snipping fabrics
0,I needed needles that were not too slippery.  These fit the bill
0,loved it
0,Love it!
0,Nice, heavy acrylic yarn for hats or whatever.  Satisfied customer.
0,I bought this for my brother and he loved it! The ones he had did not work right so I was glad to be able to find him great replacements!
0,This is an extremely high quality inking set. The price was high but the quality justified the expense. One of my favorite drawing sets.
0,I really love these!
0,Shiny, sharp lines, these are great. This vendor always sells charms that are nice.
0,I am a new knitter and had received some of these in a package of knitting supplies. I love using these as stich markers. They are thin and light weight so they mark areas without being bulky or distracting. The only thing I would add is multi-colors.
0,great Product
0,Excellent product. Keeps thread from knotting. It's an extra step but is certainly less time than you would spend unraveling a knot or cutting it and starting over.
0,Works great.  I do Embroidery and this makes my life easier with the top of it.
0,beautiful thank you, will work nicely
0,Works well, although I am not experienced in embossing, it works very well for me.  I would buy it again.
0,good
0,good hemp, doesn't have a ton of clumps in the roll
0,This was my best purchase.  The quality is definitely good.  The handle is comfortable and the case is roomy and holds the thickness that I wanted.
0,Excited about this item, I used points from an  app on my phone to purchase this item from Amazon.  Going to use the paints for various projects I have planned throughout this next year!  Awesome to get such a selection of colors!  Item arrived as described.  Thank you!  Will update as I continue to use the product!
0,I love knitters pride!
0,I received on time and it looks like the picture.  I have not made a bracelet like this before so I was not aware how much to use to make a bracelet. If I get it to turn out good I would buy again.
0,More than one shade of the colors! It is a large pallet!
0,perfect reordered and still perfect
0,amazeballs!!!!!
0,These are great for many purposes.
0,The size is great, fonts are clear, colors are fantastic and it is two-sided. First side is Tints, second is Tones & Shades.		The website on the wheel itself has expired but the company's website is: http://colorwheelco.com/products/  and they have a number of products for teaching and mixing colors including a 25 inch mondo wheel they call The Big Wheel and a Pocket Guide To Mixing Colors.		It looks like a Mom & Pop company and all their products appear to be made in their own shop.  Pretty wicked.
0,easy 2 use, no mess, no fuss
0,very good quality better then expected
0,Love it
0,Completely satisfied.
0,Perfect! love it!
0,thanks
0,nice
0,Good colors but I found them a bit hard to hydrate. Good packaging. But Ill buy only m Graham good big forward. This will be good for practice.
0,Works very well
0,I'm using this with the Fiskars 18" x 24" self healing mat.  Have made dozens of cuts quickly and easily with no apparent signs of the blade getting dull yet.  I believe other reviewers are having problems with the blade due to cutting on a solid surface, but I'm of sure of this.  Cutting straight lines is easier than I expected.  Easily goes through 4 layers of cotton material in one pass.  The handle is comfortable to grip.	Will update later if any problems are found.
0,Perfect fit for our machine
0,Quality
0,awesome!
0,Bonnie Hunter's favorite tool so use it for her mystery quilts...easy directions on ruler.
0,excellent stamps for card or scrapbook. Just mount to a clear stamp block & use ink on it. These are Fiskars a good quality brand. Very good quotes on these. Express ones feeling through thee lovely stamps. There is 7 to select from. A good way to store the clear stamps is to use a binder & put sleeves in the binder to put the stamps in.
0,made a gorgeous baby blanket,, with blues, yellows, granny squares & corner designs, all pulled together with this yarn to create a fantastic, one of a kind gift.
0,perfect
0,Love how this size works for making loops on potholders. Quality little tool and I use it.
0,I love the name of this yellow, "Duckie" is exactly what I thought of when I first saw it.  I just recently came across this yarn and have made a couple of scrubbies with it (using the patterns available from red heart.) It was a little different to work with but once I caught on to the texture, which is very similar to eyelash yarn, I was able to crochet with it pretty easily. There is a turtle scrubby that I was able to crochet and a cute owl one that I knit.		The yarn is made of 100% polyester, so it dries quickly and should not have the mildew problems that scrubbies made from all cotton are prone to.  It is not really an abrasive type of yarn, so I don't use it for scouring but rather as a good wipe down scrubby.		This is a great color for making centers of flowers or anywhere else you want yellow.  This yarn is currently available in seven different colors and I went ahead and bought one of each so that I could play with color combinations. I think you can use this yarn for any current scrubby or washcloth pattern and get something new, bright, and colorful to use around the house.
0,I was trying to use and old machine of my mother's and finding a bit of a struggle to deal with the bobbin constantly. I decided to treat myself to a new machine and what a difference having a drop in bobbin makes. It's so easy! This has quite a lot of stitches compared to Mom's old machine but not as many as a lot of new electronic machines. Still, it has plenty for me. I really enjoy working on it and learning new techniques. No complaints yet. I recently bought a Singer carrier for this to keep the dust away and to transport it safely.
0,Just what I needed to start my mixed media artwork
0,I would never buy any scissors other than Fiskars. They have it right. Wonderful scissors.
0,great layering punches ... love these for cards and tags. easy to use and well made.
0,I like them. They work very well.
0,Kinda bulky for my stitch marker needs but these are great for marking a spot on your knit/crochet item.
0,I love this set of hooks!  I've only used one size so far, but it is very easy to use and works well.  The kit is exactly as described and a very reasonable price.
0,This is a fantastic machine, I love it! O embroider everything, beach towels, pocket books, shirts, pillow cases, jackets, caps, burp rags, bibs and the list goes on. I don't like using a flash drive so this works great for me I just plug it to my laptop transfer my images and embroider away :)
0,Gave it as a gift to someone just getting into polymer clay, so it was really perfect to get many colors with out having to buy full packs.	The clay was workable and box was in good condition.
0,Great tool
0,Love this gadget.  I no longer have to make separate holes with an ice pick anymore!  Now I can go twice as fast crocheting and poking holes at the same time.  The tool is very sharp and pokes right through flannel material.
0,my second set...
0,I use this brush primarily for brushing on PVA glue for my bookbinding activities. I have also used it to paint fabric medium onto inktense shirt painting projects. The brush has been easy to wash after both glue/medium heavy activities. Its durable and the angled point is useful.
0,high quality yarn very good price
0,Wonderful for embedding photos in MP soap. Seems to have a smoother texture than some others I've tried.
0,Love this. Came out very pretty.
0,Thank You
0,Very happy with melting and mixing results.
0,Works as expected.
0,Great work, wish I had ordered more, but I will reorder from this vendor, great work very well finished chain
0,Looks great with my Stanpinup Carte Postale stamp set!
0,Perfect works Great!
0,Luv it
0,Working skeleton keys can be very expensive. Here is a whole bag full of replicas for a good price. For jewelry making, crafts and display.
0,okay
0,not to bad for the price..some are different sizes but will work. Not to strong where you have a hard time twisting it but not to weak either. Good buy for the price.
0,Good bang for your buck
0,Fabulous stamps with good detail. They come with a hole punched sheet they cling to also.
0,EXCELLENT!
0,I liked the Pitt Artist Pens 8 Assorted Black by Faber-Castell so much that I decided to order these Faber-Castell pens with primary and secondary colors. They are perfect since most of my cartoons use those colors -- which just happen to be web safe as well.
0,Perfect for my barn yard craft.
0,Beautiful needles. Nice hole makes for easy threading. Good for bookbinding. Moderately good for tapestry work.
0,Lion Brand Baby's First Yarn in Honeybee color was exactly what I wanted and needed. The packaged arrived on time but was damaged  in transit. It didn't affect of the yarn. Thank you!
0,a great acid free pen
0,Absolutely beautiful Tags and Pockets. I love anything Graphic 45!. They are the best and you can never go wrong ordering their items. These are just the right size and color and so easy to use. Love them!
0,Good paint, reasonably priced and fast shipping - AAAAA+++++
0,This versatile art tool is a great quality, solidly constructed, and arrived without damage or defect. I am pleased with the product but gave a 4/5 star rating because there is no case provided to protect the product long term (aside from the box it came in, which is already wearing quickly).
0,I had an old cheap rug, a green runner with brown border. I sponge dyed the brown border to black with this dye. Its come out real good. Nice product.
0,Yes they are gorgeous.. Love them and I love the faceting within them. makes them pop
0,I've been using these for years.  They're scary sharp, they fit tidily in my handiwork bag, and they're just plain, darned cute.  But alas, they went missing.  Went through every tote bag and drawer in the house to no avail.  Really needed my nostalgia fix, so I bit my lip and ordered a replacement pair.  I'm so glad I did.  Gingher makes excellent quality scissors and shears, period.
0,This is a great tool for poking out small die pieces that stick to the die.  It's also great for punching the hole for brads etc.  It's made very well and should last a long time.
0,loved these also, great quality
0,These are just what I needed. I wanted some vials for a game I go to that I could attach to a carabiner or some other quick release system.
0,This is nicely made cord. Works great for my hunting needs.
0,These watercolors are wonderful! Such a budget friendly buy. My daughter loves all the color options. Also, they dry quite well and fast so the watery mess on paper can be easily avoided. Love, love, love and will definitely buy again.
0,It isn't a fast sizing, but it got the job done.  I'm pleased with the purchase.
0,condensed and easy to carry
0,Very nice yarn.  I didn't get enough the first time so ordered more.
0,bought for my new home that has strict guidelines  on what you can use. should fit the bill
0,Very pretty and elegant die.  Cuts easily.
0,This Cold Press is wonderful.  I have been able to use watercolor pencil as well as tube watercolor paint.  It hold up well.  You should have no difficulty with this product.  Cathi
0,Great!!
0,great product
0,Good quality
0,Nice size, and sturdy.  we use them all over the place.
0,Theses are just what I wanted; not the junkie imperfect glass you get in some of the stores. All these are perfectly clear and no inclusions!
0,great for paper crafting
0,Lovely color, soft yarn, works up very nicely.	No shedding, no color transfer.	This is a nice and very budget-friendly yarn, and chunky, which makes for quick protect completion.	Buy it!
0,As Advertised
0,ABSOLUTELY GREAT
0,Nice wording
0,I liked the beads but I didn't receive 100...more like 60.
0,Helpful when the hot gun is to big
0,mis reead thought it was going to be bigger but its a neet little note pad
0,Nice and sharp!
0,Great size for card making - would highly recommend.
0,nice quality pretty bracelet to add charms to
0,Easy-to-use
0,I like this die as cutting circles is just not my favorite thing to do.  I just wish the Snowman and accesories had came on the same die.  It would of saved me time, because I thought I was getting the Snowman with the circles together.  So I then had to go back and order the  Snowman accesories and due to that I have not started any snowman on any quilt as it took over a month to get them both, but bought separately so had to wait.  So the only thing I could do was cut circles in preparation to do ones for next Christmas Bazaar.
0,Works very good; takes a long time to heat up and as the warning states, don't touch the inside - that is HOT.  I like having it beside the sewing machine.  I have a "mini board" my husband made for me to use.
0,Just the right size
0,Love this paper.
0,I like these for different purposes
0,Good quality thread, purchased for top stitching and worked great.  Happy with purchase
0,Very nice wool roving, perfect for what I needed. I was looking for vibrant colors and found it here.  The colors are nice and bright, although if you prefer a softer color palette there are several color packages to choose from.  I may have to order some other colors to add to my collection.
0,Charming little fox sunning in the leaves:D  I always love doing Dimensions PBN!  The right amount of challenging therapeutic fun.  As always- nice brush and more than enough paint provided.
0,Love Red Heart!!!
0,Works great with my machine.
0,They look good and sturdy, and feel great - just like sable hair. If it didn't say in the product title that these are nylon brushes, I'd never know it. I'm hoping the bristles don't start to fall out or the ferrules  start to rust. I'll take care of these, but for the price I feel as if they are a great deal.
0,A perfect easel for both professional artists and beginners, it will definitely exceed your expectations!!! It is very sturdy and lightweight at the same time, and very convenient to use everywhere!
0,Works great and is really nice quality. Works perfect for making things out of 550 cord I even used it with some Amstel blue cord!
0,Amazed at how well these thin portable lightbox work!
0,Box is larger than expected,  but the variety in size of containers is very helpful.
0,The Cricut Designstudio Software is a must have! It helps you utilize your Cricut machine to it's fullest. You can visualize what you are doing, waste less paper and save so much time. I got one for my home computer and another one for my laptop. When we go camping with the grandchildren, they use the Cricut in the camper. I don't think they would understand what they are trying to accomplish without the software that shows them exactly what it is that they will be cutting. For instance,they draw a background of mountains, sky and lake or river on a big piece of paper. Using the Camp Out software, they cut out tents, motor homes, fireplace, trees, etc.. If we couldn't see how big these items were before cutting, the fish could be bigger than the tent when we glue it to the background.
0,I would have given this 5 stars, but I don't feel it's a good enough value for the money. For what I paid for these, I can get almost 15 with free shipping. It was good for quick replacement in a hurry while I waited for my batch of 50 to arrive.
0,For class
0,too expensive but good paint.
0,I was going to purchase a similar set of 3(Pentel) with high reviews BUT they didn't have a set of diff assortments like these. I'm glad I went with these as I'm not limited. This is my first time attempting to use watercolor pencils and these brushes made things a breeze to work with! Water does come out fast and inconsistent at times but it's not a big deal as I dab it on cloth prior to using and test it on my finger as well. You can always go back and wipe each time. I have nothing to compare this to yet...the smallest brush works extremely well on small details!	Update: I took away 1star due to the larger brush not having water control. The smaller brushes do not either but it's easier to work with. I will probably purchase more brushes from diff companies to compare. the second largest brush is a little better but still wouldn't trust it too much. The smallest brush I have been able to do MANY things with and is all I use basically.
0,perfect for die cutting.
0,Such a useful tool! It's perfect!
0,I had never done any type of stitching before and I got the hang of this pretty quickly. Its a little difficult seperating and threading the needle at first, but you'll get used to it. Theres more then enough thread if you need it and the instructions are pretty easy to follow. The needle is a regular metal one, not one of those plastic safe ones. The little round ring holds it taut and in place while you stitch. A fun little project to teach you the basics of a couple types of stitching. A template is given and you can trace the outline easily.
0,These are perfect sized gears for doing Steampunk.  They are in various sizes and work great with metal clays and resin.
0,LOVE EK tools
0,love this.  holds my soft touch hooks which are my new favorite hooks,  I was looking for a case that would fit them.
0,Great
0,Always use Grafix chipboard, great buy
0,Well made. Used for painting projects.
0,Just in time for Valentine's Day crafting.  Can't wait to see what I can craft with this die!  I was looking for hearts and not just the ordinary run-of-the-mill variety and this jumped right out to say 'BUY ME'!
0,I've had good results when using all of Ranger Adirondack alcohol inking supplies.
0,Bobbin and thread go together like butter and bread.  Quick shipping and item exactly as described.
0,Great glitter just as described. Also got here way earlier than expected~
0,Cut the wire and made into circles to put under my slug eaten plants. So far it is working at keeping the slugs off the plants.
0,Nice quality yarn...good price for what you are getting.
0,Makes cutting large pieces of fabric sooooooo easy
0,Great for crafts.
0,Does the job perfect! Exactly what I was expecting!
0,Love this product
0,Just as pictured...all the newer colors from a few years ago...ones that I didn't have! Very plased with price!
0,Great!
0,My wife loves them!
0,Im so happy with this purchase, It gives you so many choices without having  to drag around all your crochet needles and it is very well made and nice and light weight, easy to handle.  The only disappointment is that I don't have more time to crochet, because after getting my  Boye hook set  ive been looking  for projects everywhere.  I am sorry to say the carier case ad a broken zipper but that's all. ODER THIS YOU WILL LOVE IT!
0,I am a beginner and wanted some quilting templates that I could try out.
0,works just great
0,Got this jus to try its effect used it only once and had some fun with it, used to splatter the white foam in the zoomed in picture.	Full painting: (...)
0,Beware this is not black, it's a greenish black. (Wrought Iron)		Used it as the backing and bottom cover for my aquarium (outside glass, of course).		Took a few coats, but works great.  Acrylic is nice because of the ease of cleanup and that you can just take a razor to it to remove older paint.
0,Good product, I like it.
0,Perfect economy canvas. You get what you pay for and you may have trouble covering the canvas. You can apply another layer of gesso to the canvas to get past this problem. I paint high volume abstract/animal acrylic paintings and find these to be the best value...or best bang for your buck.
0,nice product
0,Wife used this stabilizer for her Embroidery projects and she says it is a great product and plans on ordering more in near future - it also arrived on time and she highly recommends company and product.

0,great product
0,I love this yarn. It's so soft and easy to work. I repurchase whenever I notice the price is lowering.
0,Love Alcohol inks, especially when working with non porous projects otherwise regular paints just would not be able to fill the bill. These are awesome colors too.... would be great for Easter projects.
0,I love the shimmer...just be careful when you press to not release too much "ink"
0,Very happy all the colors. Good quality wool to make lots of little critters!
0,Item as described, good quality, fast shipping...very pleased. Would recommend this item to others. Quick release works smoothly and fits snugly.
0,Love this brush. Use it to dust off my coloring books when coloring. Love the handle. Easy to hold
0,Great for open spots on a card that need a little something extra.
0,Love these stamps!
1,so playable you can bend it with your fingers
1,it gets stuck some times the hole punch outter rim on the inside of the punch. Is not the same size as the resin stickers i purchased so i cannot use it.
1,It's a very light pink and nothing of this shade. Disappointing.
1,not as described.  very tiny  probably will not order again
1,For the cost an design of this airbrush I figured I would try it out. I needed a second airbrush. I received the item on time.  So I put paint in it hook it up to my compresser pull the trigger it sprays decent for the price. I try different patterns of spraying wide.... thin lines it works pretty good. The quality seems pretty good.  But when I let off the trigger completely the airbrush continues to spray air. I would assume a manufacturing defect or assembled incorrectly. These things happen. I ended up returning it no problems.  If I didn't have the trigger problem I probably would have kept it.  If your looking for a cheap airbrush this might be ok as long as you don't have any problems with it.  I'm going to just purchase an airbrush that cost a little bit more. Sometimes it's worth it.
1,I would have to agree, not what I was expecting. I was hoping to be able to replace using paper towels or tea towels.		However, Hero Arts cards and envelopes are really good.
1,I wish i had read the comment reviews before ordering these toy sized yarn samples. Oh so that's what "Bonbons" means, I feel stupid but on the bright side, I'll use them for beginners knitting projects.
1,The packaging of this product was fairly well and that the mailing of this product came to me on time.  Nevertheless, I made this mistake by only looking at the rhinestones and not checking the size and the cut of it.  I was hoping for bigger rhinestones but it was smaller than I anticipated.  Yes, it does meet my needs as a designer but the picture deceived me making me think it was bigger.  So, lesson learned for me.
1,Does not print very well. I ordered 2 because you only get 5 per package. Expensive for what you get especially with the poor quality. I have a high end printer so I know that is not the issue. I will not order again.
1,FIrst I want to say that there is NOTHING wrong with the mannequin itself. This mannequin is exceptionally crafted for what you pay that is why I give it a 2/2 stars. The missing three stars came from when I received the mannequin the neck piece was missing. I called Ben right away and he was able to ship one to me. I waited a few days and it finally arrived, with 4 or 5 dents in the neck piece making it impossible to fit around the circumference of the mannequins neck. First i want to point out, we are only humans we make mistakes okay fine, all was forgiven I even told many people to buy from them. The mannequins neck piece was metal nothing like the one in this picture, so i sent it back because the neck piece was damaged. Ben rush orders one for next day delivery it arrives, I am ecstatic! No, now its cherry wood and creates this unbalance look to this mannequin , it looks incomplete still. I called and made a complaint still no resolution. I feel sort of scammed, I think you should do it right the first time so both parties involved don't go through the hassle and freight of getting what they are expecting. I feel like the neck piece originally was already missing and they shipped this to me anyway. 2 chances to do what was right but my mannequin is still without a neck piece :(
1,We are looking for a cord for the Babylock ES1.  They specifically said "ES1" in the description.  It doesn't fit!  I have an older BL ES1 that I'm giving to a friend who can't afford to buy a machine.  Buyer beware!  For the cord to fit, both ends must be rounded.  The ends of this cord are round and square.  I'm very disappointed and now have to start looking all over again.  It will fit the Babylock Rachel and since I have one of those, I'll keep it as a spare.  But meanwhile, the search continues.
1,The case is kind of cute and the thread is okay, but none of it is worth the cost. It has a twist latch to close it and it is very hard to turn. If feels like it will break pretty quickly.		Fyi, the needles are sewing machine needles
1,Do not expect the beads you receive to look like the picture. I have ordered several bead strands from this company and its kind of hit or miss. The Australian Jade beads I ordered do not look like the picture shown. The beads are not the bright green colors in the picture but rather a more darkish green color overall. In fairness I have to say that other beads do match the picture shown, just not the Australian Jade beads.
1,I am really not pleased with this paper. No grid, which I didn't notice in the description. Almost impossible to unroll since there is no backer on it. It is stuck to itself in a big way. By the time you get a piece off of the roll it is all stuck together and virtually useless.  Not sure why I thought a rollof this would be a good idea other than the price.
1,Since when did Amazon become the yarn police? I was only allowed to buy four skeins when it says there are 19 available. Now as a long-term Prime member not only do I have to spend 25 $ , I am limited to how many I can buy. It's like saying you can only buy two cups of flour when you need four. While I am at it...Amazon use to always have the best prices but not anym ore. I doubt I will renew my Prime Membership
1,Sounds good in theory. In practice, the Buttoneer works for light thicknesses of cloth. For heavier thicknesses, like a collar button, or denim jeans, the device is not able to push the needle and little nylon button retainer through the fabric. I found this device far too limited in application to get much use out of it.
1,These pencils are ridiculously large; can't find a pencil sharpener that fits.
1,returned  It was the wrong color
1,I'm like the others- saw craft sticks and didn't read reviews because I didn't think I needed to. Thought they were Popsicle sticks- but they're the size of tooth picks lol
1,It is okay!
1,Unfortunately, the six by six chripboard was smashed at two corners when I received it.  All the way through the package.
1,This item was not what I expected. The cost was higher then if I bought it at was of Walmart. I was expecting maybe one of the larger balls of yarn at this price or at least 2 balls of yarn.
1,I can't comment on the iridescent set since I now have the pastels set, a set I definitely did not want. Colors are very bland and pastel...
1,Does not work well.  Even with several applications, the brushes are useless.
1,I had used this Regulator for about 4 days and a couple of days ago I started smelling a really bad burnt odor and none of my airbrushes would work no air or paint so I started to disconnect the hose from the Regulator and it was so hot I couldn't touch it with my fingers upon getting the Regulator off it had left burnt marks on the connector on my Compressor after disconnecting and doing a straight hookup with my hose to Compressor and then to my Iwata Airbrush my Compressor started skipping so I called Amazon and they made everything Ok. I can't tell you not to buy this Regulator I can just tell you mine is in the TRASH and I Will Never Buy This Regulator AGAIN		Mike_Tina 10.13
1,The pin part is not very smooth making holes in fine fabric like silk. It snags and tears, I wouldn't buy these again.
1,I bought this product at a craft store, not on Amazon.  I was disappointed to find that the ink was rather dry and does not create clear images.  Also, each ink pad is not removable, so it is difficult to use the middle color.  I am disappointed because I have read good things about color box.  I don't know if I am doing something wrong or if this particular product is just a dud.
1,When you add these to your order you may not realize they are going to be shipped on a very slow boat from China or some other place over there. It took a month for them to arrive, if you don't actually need them very soon it's probably OK. These are 15J bobbins and if that is what you need OK. However they are featured on the Singer 7443 page BUT the 7443 uses a type 15 bobbin. People have reported having problems using the 15J in their 7400 series machines so BEWARE!
1,works ok, but leaks
1,don't really like it
1,This is a very thin braided candle wick.  I used in a variety of 3" X 3.5" H glass candleholders and even with double wicking (not recommended with a candleholder of that size but I was desperate), the wick didn't burn consistently.  Also, a cotton braided wick without thread woven through will not stand up straight and will curl at the tip after burning (making it turn down into the wax; kind of like an ingrown hair). Check your candle circumference and height and make sure you purchase a wick that fits your project.  Who knew?  We've learned wicks are not interchangeable.
1,Cheap quality; many of these broke apart in my hands even before use.  But, for the cheap price, it was what I expected.  I might buy again, just expecting that about 10/20 will be usable.  Also, not sure how long they would last.  I have found better quality at the store (just regular craft stores like AC Moore or Michaels, etc.)
1,nice foldable feature but unfortunately the item I received had a burnt rubber odor that has not dissipated after 3 weeks of being laid flat to air out the odor
1,The lock broke on the container first time I opened it
1,The paint chips off these way to easy! Ruined so many just putting them on
1,I bough 3 punches all returned!! All had the same issue!! They wouldn't even close!!!!
1,Meh. I only bought it because it was with the Add On program thing. I mean, I wasn't expecting much with the scrubber I made, but yeah. I don't think a tighter stitch would've made much of a difference. I'm just glad I didn't buy this because I really was looking for a decent scrubber. I think the cotton dishrags I knitted did a better job on the dished than this but, again, I wasn't expecting much to begin with.		Only buy this for the looks.
1,The tips have no brush-head, just twisted wire with a sharp tip, so as they go into parts of the airbrush, they scratch the surface.  It works okay with metal parts if it is not forced, but not with plastic parts, They remove plastic and leave grooves in the plastic.  Not good for airbrushes with plastic parts.
1,Don't buy this!!!! I got this thinking this would be such a great buy/deal. Mine doesn't work for 2 mins without malfunctioning!!!! The thread gets stuck!!! The stitching isn't good or tight. It looks worse than if I did it by hand!!!! Don't wast your money!!! I'm a single mom hoping this would help with clothes cost and other items but instead I ended up wasting it!!!!!!!! I hope that doesn't happen to you!!!! So please read!!!!
1,I would not buy this for any child. Its confusing and the strands of yarn they send aren't long enough to get everything done. Great idea, wrong set up.
1,Rather disappointing. One of the rungs is so warped, that it will be unusable. The wood is splintered and bare.
1,BEGINNERS BEWARE!!!!		This is 100 random colors, not a brand that can be found in Michaels or common craft stores.	I thought I would receive a lot of colors for some of the patterns I am working on (I am a beginner, admittedly this was a silly assumption, but now you can learn from me!) but I received 1 useful color out of 100. My package came with all dull colors, no bright ones as displayed in picture.	Compared to DMC ones I bought at Michaels and colors are close, but not exact.	The icing on the cake was a lightning deal occurred the day after I purchased these and both seller/amazon would not refund the difference ($6).	Basically I wasted $15 for a product I will probably never use.
1,I did not notice how very tiny the eyelets are on these units. I cannot use them with the necklace I wished to as there are the lobster-claw fasteners on either end and they won't fit into these. I hope I can use them on future necklaces.
1,Didn't use...and couldn't use to sew on to outfit as planned....
1,I thought it said it would work on any snaps but it will not work on #24 snaps & leather.  Darrell
1,was disappointed how small this product is
1,This is usely a good yarn for price. I pitched 3. The first one was really nice when I started on my blanket. Half way through it was not twisted as well as at the beginning but still it was fine. The other two was separating and catching on the crochet hook. I was making a baby blanket but because of the separating of the yarn I decided to make it a smaller blanket for my grandaughters dolls. I would not buy this again because of the time you lose when it splits on the hook and the stitches are not always smooth.
1,nothing comes out
1,This says bracelet wire - but it really isn't appropriate for bangle bracelets. You need much thicker wire for that. Not sure hat type of bracelets you could use this for.
1,The opening flap on the top front of the envelope does not overlap, so when turning the pages as I place them in a binder, everything just shifts up amd slides out all over my desk.  Doesn't hold or keep items in plastic.  This defeats the purpose of purchasing and using these inserts.  I would not recommend them.
1,This glue gun is a hazard leaks bad	Mod Podge should take this gun off the market before someone gets seriously burned.
1,can not find thread to use
1,Very disappointed! These jump rings have such good reviews I was sure they were going to be cut nice and flush and line up well when closed. As they are stainless steel I also expected them to be very strong. Of course lastly I expected to be able to get the size I needed when I needed it because it came in a nice little compartmentalized package. None of these seem to be true. First, when I opened the package none of the little lids lined up over their individual compartments so much of them spilled out of some of the compartments and at least some of them in every size is out so its a big mess. They are definitely not cut nice and flush and do not line up nicely. I knew these were  stainless steel so I did not expect a bright silver but I did expect the strength of stainless steel and yet these do not seem to be very strong either. Overall these are a big disappointment and will likely end up in my junk drawer unused for years. I make a lot of jewelry and I need a decent product but this doesn't cut it. They'll do for kids jewelery or crafts.
1,I purchase this from another store and returned it the next day. The bobbin thread consistently would wind unevenly.  One of my machines is very particular about how even the bobbin thread is. Disappointing as I had this was only wish list for a while
1,Sorry looked larger than it is. I can't use it. Guess I just don't know my metric sizes.
1,This is not a genuine foot. It fits all my berninas but not like the real ones and it makes a clicking noise when you start to sew.
1,Bleeds like crazy
1,These colors are mixes of paints, have nothing to do with real art. They are not attractive or suitable for amateurs, much less the serious painter. Also, it is very thin and milky
1,They look so pretty. I got my hopes up. They didn't look dark black in some lighting. But, now that is not as bad. The holes are painted over. I tried so many with my elastic cord. It is the one solid rubber string. Not lucky. I couldn't get it through many beads at all. The few that worked are hard to push through and hard to slide down the elastic. I used the tip of a pen to break some paint. But they are too small. I got an earing wire through easily. But, even if I spun it and pushed the holes were too small still. I tried to use some thick metal stringing wire. It was strong and able to break through most beads. But even after that I can't get my elastic cord in most of them. Unfortunately I bought a larger bead and small bead jars. A good point is that they do seem to be fairly even in size. Also they are colored evenly. I think they made perfect beads and rolled them in paint. Threw them in a jar and left the hard work to us.	The smaller beads I got had more that went through.
1,I was surprised to read the other reviews that say that it doesn't fit the SE-400 because the screw is too short-mine fits just fine and the screw was long enough. However, I am not a fan of this walking foot at all. Whenever I want to quilt, the foot does not transport the fabric evenly enough, unless I shove it in and move it along with my hands. If I don't shove it in, I get a 1mm stitch when it is set on 3mm. I do make sure to support the quilt, and have it not hang and drag on the needle or walking foot, so it shouldn't have the uneven stitch length issue.	I will try my luck with the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Brother-SA188-Open-Toe-Walking-Foot/dp/B001UYSI8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Brother SA188 Open Toe Walking Foot</a>&nbsp;and hopefully it will work better and give me better stitch length results.	On a side note, I did order directly from amazon and received a genuine model with the Brother packaging.
1,Was dried out when I received it, must have had a small opening where the air got in, dissapointed.
1,This paper is so thin you can't even erase a pencil line without it wrinkling. My fault completely that I did not check the weight of the paper. I think average printing paper may be thicker.	I'm still new to the alcohol marker medium, but to me this was a "miss." But they do have great markers and from what I've read/watched some of the best watercolors. Sorry W & N!
1,These are ok. You get a lot, but the adhesive doesn't stick very well. I ended up gluing them down
1,Well, I should have listened to the other reviewers before I purchased this sewing foot. I still have no idea how to put this thing onto my machine, let alone how to make it work! Comes with no instructions, not even a print out or a web site to go to.
1,As soon as I took this out of the packaging I noticed all the holes! I counted three, but they were near the bottom, and since I order more length than I needed, I trimmed them off. It wasn't until I went to attach the tulle to the comb that I noticed all the others! They were much deeper, about 20" from the side. Every hole was about the size of a nickle. I decided to trim the side to remove them, and see what the veil would look like. I wanted a 108' wide veil, but now it's only 80" due to all the flaws in the fabric. Luckily, the defects were on the same side, or else there is no way I would have kept it.		It doesn't wrap around me like I wanted, so I haven't decided if you should keep it or try again (with a different seller).
1,Not very useful for polymer clay
1,too many are in bad shape, not as pictured
1,I sent these back. The quality is just not there. The latch is not a good design. It bends easily and then will not latch. Too bad as they are pretty enough. I retuned for a refund
1,Kind of cheesy and cheap feeling, but I ordered them because they were a good price. I think I'll stick with name brands and pay for quality.
1,It does say for kids and adults alike, I would say this is an emergency only kit. I was purchasing this for my daughter with a mini sewing machine. The plastic crochet hook among other items will not stand the test of a child. Amazon prime however does have much more suitable items for a small child.
1,Really disappointed in it's performance. Very hard to use and not worth the effort.
1,FAKE
1,really didn't live up to the you tube hype ,,, so impressed just threw it in a drawer
1,Save your money because this product does not work. We use plastic paint palettes as resin molds because they have a lot of interesting shapes. Most paint palettes are pretty flexible and it is easy to pop the cured resin shapes out. We recently used a more rigid paint palette and tried this mold release ahead of time, following all instructions. Absolute waste of time because the resin was impossible to dislodge.
1,Overall cheaply made. Surprised as it's made in Germany. Must be the Chinese section of Bavaria.	Plastic crap handle. No weight to it. The business end which should be very smooth is rough.	I had a staedler ( I think it was Staedler) that I bought in Office Depot years ago but lost it somewhere. Cost about 5 bucks. The handle was a hard resin, clean and polished steel tip. The screw mechanism was well made and didn't flop around to the touch. Wish I could find another one.		So I had to use this for masking. Adjusted the tip with the screw. After one use the screw has stopped working.		Return!
1,I bought this to use with acrylics as I am new to the medium.  It really comes up short to be used as indicated. The acrylics must be totally dry to be pealed off and it takes days to dry to that point if you have any paint except a small smear.  This would work for watercolor although not very large surface for mixing.  Better to use palette paper or styrofoam plate.
1,These pencils look great but they are poor quality pencils. The coverage is awful. No matter how much you color over and over, there are still white spots left where the pigments fail to adhere. The leads broke on my very first attempt to sharpen them. The hunt for affordable oil based pencils continues.
1,This sharpener sharpens alright but it is so cheaply made. I like to never have figured how to take it apart to empty it. It doesn't seem durable. The lid has a thin plastic hinge that's looks like it won't last long. They're making a mint off this. Not worth the high price for what you get.
1,These patches were not cut to the edge of the stitching and made the patches look off-centered.  Very shoddy craftsmanship.
1,It constantly got twisted with my yarn.
1,These are to thick and uncomfortable on your finger. :(
1,I'm disappointed.  I wish they had shown a photo of it empty.  From the pictures shown, it appeared to have compartments in the main section, but it is completely open.  Anything put in it will just fall over when the box is moved.  I had wanted to put a lot of craft items in it, but it's just not suitable for most of them.  The drawer seems to be pretty easy to slide and will hold a lot of small items.
1,Serioulsy, they needed to advise their consumers that the Cricut did not take the 6x12 " mat.  Why in the world would they sell this thing if  you can't use it in the machine?  I was not happy and of course, it would cost me to return this so I didn't, I just kept it.  Not worth the money.
1,Junk
1,Don't buy it unless you know what likes like already, small, cheap plastic. I thought they were going to way bigger.
1,Doesn't cut well at all.  A big disappointment.  Wish I had tried it right away so I could have sent it back.
1,Many of these chains have a whitish looking chemical burn on the finish of the chain. Cheaply made.
1,The bristle head came off the first time I used it and it sheds a lot more than most calligraphy brushes. I can glue the head back on and can deal with the shedding, but I wouldn't buy this again, nor would I recommend it to others. Also, the brush forms a fine tip at first, but it becomes a spread-out mess after a minute or so (and then it breaks). Boo. Hiss.
1,this is a joke..... its like clear buggers to play with lmao
1,I use for my garden but is is not my favorite, I like twist ties
1,Wonder if I was ripped off here--No where does it say Kolinsky brushes except on the box.  The round 8 is already losing hairs andw hold a point.
1,I had high hopes for these based on reviews. The color variety is convenient and the caps are nice. However, I find that the "lead" part easily breaks under the necessary pressure to make marks. It will break off about 1/2 inch of the lead, so it takes forever to sharpen back down to where it's usable. I'm losing so much of it from breaking. Very disappointed. I'm switching over to water soluble markers now, because I'm having such a hard time finding decent chalk or pencils.
1,They fit the wheel well. They didn't get in the way of my throwing. However, the inserts fit very tightly. I had to hit them with my fist to get them to go in the adapter, even when brand new. Then in order to get the pot off the wheel, I had to pry the inserts out using the handle of one of my clay tools. Then, they say that you don't have to wire the pot off the bat because they pop off as they dry. Well, my pots didn't pop off. After having to cut a fairly dry pot off an insert, I cut wet pots off the inserts right after I threw them as I always do with other bats. However, as they dry, they stick again, and have to again be cut off the insert again. That's hard, because these bats are porous, so the bottom of the pot drys a little faster than it would on a plastic bat. Now, after I've used a couple of the inserts for a couple of pots each, they won't fit in the adapter. I'm going to have to sand them or something. This bat system does work, and after I sand the inserts, it should work better. But I'm not entirely happy with the way it works. I have been a potter for about 20 years, BTW.
1,I ordered this one because it said "Lifetime". It is very thin and cheaply made. When we finally went into town (2 hrs away)I saw this at JoAnn's for $1.36. The 2 stars is for the product and description not the price since it was delivered and on time.
1,NOT 50 yards, about 20. Inaccurate description.
1,The paints have a horrific smell. Moldy smell! Please do not buy,as the paints are thin and pale,	need 3=4 coats to get the color. poor mixing.
1,piece of junk just order one for a little more and save the money
1,They really need to show a more realistic photo of this thread. The picture makes it look big, but the spools are small,  more the size of a small spool of embroidery thread. The spool is 2 inches high, and 1 inch across.	I don't even want to bother threading my serger with the, because I will run out if thread so fast and have to thread the machine again, and we all know how fun that is(n't). I'll try to put up a photo if I can figure out how to do it.
1,I bought Snazaroo Face Paint (2 in light grey, 1 in white and 1 in black) and no matter what I did, the makeup would cake and crumble before I could get even coverage. I used very little water as recommended (I also tried more and less in other attempts hoping to fix the issue) and nothing helped. I tried applying with high quality smooth makeup sponges, my fingers and a foundation brush as well, hoping one of those might help but nothing did. I was left with makeup that kept wanting to get crumbly and flake off, and even after setting it, trying to apply shading lightly with a powder was a nightmare. I see so many good reviews for this, which is why I tried it over all others, but honestly, it really let me down and I am frustrated that I chose to use Snazaroo. All I wanted was a body paint with good coverage, non shiny finish, and no caking/crumbling/flaking/cracking. I give it two stars, as by the 5th try I had an ok looking application, but not even an hour later it was getting crumbly still. It did come off pretty easy and didn't irritate my skin, so another plus there. I didn't apply it with a heavy hand, and used the recommended smooth upward strokes. Overall though I am disappointed. From faraway it still looked fine, but any close ups and all you could see was a crumbly textured mess on my face.
1,These buttons remind me of little poker chips with holes in them.  They are very bulky, and do not enhance the appearance of anything they might be used on in sewing.  They might be useful as game pieces, or as chips to put under uneven table legs...???
1,Pegs are either too loose or won't fit.  Cannot use with heavier wire, even 18 gauge. Got to use a Wigjig at a demo and thought I could get by with this less expensive alternative. Cannot. This the adage "you get what you pay for" is spot on.
1,Love the look of these, and they are useful! But the metal is thin and flimsy, and the paint over the metal comes off at the edges.
1,I can't believe this is even made. It is the most unpleasant feeling yarn I've ever felt. A total waste.
1,This purchase was a HUGE waste of money! It doesn't show up, surface looks no different and it is an invinsable waste of time and money. Product did Nothing!!
1,"chipboard" im thinking something more sturdy this is cardboard
1,The mint is not working properly I followed instructions and made sure I entered stamp sheet correctly and had the proper size  Status ready  The minute I insert stamp sheet fRon the back status line changed to remove stamp.  I tried both stamp sheets  Both got stuck and I had to pry them out  I am frustrated and annoyed. I Wold like to send this one back and try another please
1,These are not at all what I thought I was getting. The picture makes the beads look so much nicer/more like pearls than they actually are. In person they look like slightly shining white beads, which is great if you just need white beads. However, I purchased them to mix with some other glass pearl 8mm and 10mm beads to use for my wedding. The other beads look JUST like pearls and these looked bad enough next to them that I spent 2 hours picking out these beads from the container after I mixed them together. These might be nice on their own, but they were much too white and plastic-y to use with other real and faux beads.
1,Followed dorecta to a "t" and it ruined my fabric. It didn't dye evenly. Considering it was cotton there shouldn't have been any issues.
1,Had trouble getting bottom thread setup to work.  Consulted videos but ultimately to no avail.  Also, too tight spacing for my hands.  Finally gave up.  Don't know how much was my fault or machines fault.
1,They are way too small you can't get the soap out!
1,Stay away from this yarn...it's pilly, too soft and flimsy and did I mention pilly and fuzzy....it's awful.
1,I sent mine back.
1,it stink, even dried up, it harden the fabric a lot, and you can hardly see the glitter, it just ruined the costumes I was making, will not buy this brand ever again
1,Tarnishes.
1,This does not harden the bead like I expected it too~
1,It did not meet my expectations.  I was expecting a light shade of coral.  It was nice and soft though.
1,doesnt work
1,When I got it, it's already rusted. Not "tarnish resistant' at all.
1,I got these and my first thought was that they looked like expensive crayons butt then I used them.  Not a fan all. They felt like creations, strewn that easily blendable  either.
1,I tried these scissors and had to return them ... well, exchange them (at my local jo ann) ... they are really uncomfortable to use. The blades are much thicker than they appear and don't seem like embroidery scissors to me. Besides that, I bought them, against my better judgement, at full price (maybe that's why I didn't like them :).. I took them back two days later when I found out my local store was having a 50% off sale on scissors (and other stuff) and got the 5" knife edge pair ... eh, still not real impressed, but do like them better. They are like mini-duckbills. Still they are awkward feeling in my hand.		Generally speaking, I wouldn't recommend these scissors. If you can get to target, go to the scrapbooking section and get a pair of pink or yellow ones they have. You want to talk SHARP scissors and FINE POINTS ... and CHEAP. I have two pair.
1,I really love this shade, but there's something about it that pisses me off. There are at least two pigments that go into this color, one's kind of a teal and the other is kind of a lavender. when used in it's full concentration this color is great. If you try to blend it out or  dilute it to much with colorless blender, or as I do for larger areas, alcohol in a spray bottle, the teal-ish pigment will stain where you laid it down, and the lavender-ish pigment will spread out. this really pissed me off on this one piece I was commissioned for and it took a great deal of darkening the entire thing to camouflage it out the best I could. I just want to prevent you from making the same mistake.
1,I was using this machinefor a few months and it was working okay, then I decided to sew two pieces of fabric together and something on the inside snapped and it was completely broken and useless from that point on. I tried to contact Brother multiple times but they wouldn't do anything and ended up canceling my warranty somehow. I do not recommend this product, go with a Singer instead.
1,Just started my project with this yarn. I knit on a loom not with knitting needles. The yarn is a bit hard to work with, kind of separates and bunches together and the ends fray badly. Love the color, reminds my of Goldie Locks hair. I hope the project does not look all frayed when I am finished.	UPDATE: This is the worst yarn you can buy. I wish I could give it less than one star. It bunched, frayed, separated and caused me nothing but problems. The last few stitches, even knitting without any tension at all, the yarn broke which made my project a piece of trash. I will never buy this brand of yarn again. I knit hats for the homeless in my area and they deserve better than this.	UPDATE #2: I contacted Lion Brand yarn with the same review as above. Their customer service is AWESOME. Debbie contacted me and offered me a replacement. I knit hats for the homeless and she helped me pick something that would give me the most bang for my buck. I probably won't buy this TYPE of yarn again but I will definitely buy Lion Brand!
1,REALLY complicated. I couldn't figure it out.
1,this punch does not work....not worth the trouble.....
1,It is OK, but with the soft touch handles it becomes bulky when wrapped.  I like the regular case better, but still, both need a place for scissors and markers or other crochet essentials.
1,Piece of trash.  Save your money.  I even bought their brand of glue sticks (at extra expense) and it still didn't work.	The trigger did not work.  You have to push the glue stick forward with a pencil or screw driver....and then they are ruined.....can't be used anymore as they have glue on them.  Total waste of money.
1,If you are punching items "stand alone" these are probably okay, although the spread on the handles is almost too wide for my hand to grasp comfortably.  However, for me as a card maker, they are pretty much a loss because the depth is about 1/8" which is no good at all for positioning.  I'll figure out a way to make my circle dies from Spellbinders work.  If you are looking at being able to position a circle cut on the interior of a page, don't get this.
1,I tried both this paint and the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Martha-Stewart-32217-6-Ounce-Chalkboard-Paint-Black/dp/B007C7XLFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Martha Stewart 32217 6-Ounce Chalkboard Paint, Black</a>&nbsp;to paint on glass and side by side I liked the results with the Martha Stewart product MUCH better.  For some reason this paint dried with more of a glossy sheen while the Martha Stewart paint had more of a matte look to it, more like what I've come to expect from a chalkboard look.  With both though I think you need to temper your expectations.  They were hard to write on with basic chalk but worked much better with chalk markers.  I also recommend opting for high quality paint brushes.  It made for a much smoother finish and no brush bristles left behind which can make for an uneven and unsightly surface.
1,doesn't work any better than my fingers
1,The colors are beautiful!!!		Have not gotten to do any sewing yet but so far the bobbins I have made have stood the test of speed.		Delivery took forever!!!!		If you want it quickly don't order this!!!
1,I LOVE Johanna Basford and was one of the first on the coloring bandwagon, so please don't take this review on her artwork, this is solely on the canvas/makers.		UGGGG!!!! Horrible!!! You can't even use Fineliners! They end up leaving a dusty-like, spotty residue on the canvas. It may seem like this is a well-made product, but aparently you can only use THEIR marker brand on them. Forget that!
1,Unfortunately I found this to have a flimsy threader that bent out of shape the first time that I used it.  I think I will stick with the cheaper ones that come in a 3-pack.
1,Reading all the reviews I figured these clips would be a lifesaver. Well, I guess I was wrong. Here's my take on them:		Pros		- you can't stick yourself with a needle	- they have markings for seam allowances		Cons		- they are bulky	- they take up a lot of space when stored	- you cannot sew over them as you can with pins if you place them perpendicular to your seam	- they are a pain to take off close to your presser foot		Oh, did I mention you cannot sew over them? Right. Seriously, I don't understand the hype around these things.	Even at half price off they are way overpriced compared to regular sewing pins. You can get 100 pins of varying lengths, ballpoint, etc. for $5 easily. These cost 3 times as much when half-price off and don't get the job done as precisely as pins.		I sew a lot with stretch and PUL fabric and they are worthless in that area. Plus, if you sew clothes or other items you usually mark your seamline anyway or you use the gauge on the maching; so there really is no need for the seam markings on the clips.	Perhaps they are more useful than pins for quilters or people sewing with multiple thick layers, but for clothesmaking they certainly are not.		***UPDATE 09/25		Based on the comments on my review, it seems that I have hit a sensitive spot by even bringing up the fact that one could possibly sew over pins. Admittedly, I sometimes sew over pins, perpendicular to the seam-very slowly and with a larger stitch length. Is it the preferred course of action-no, but certain types of fabric do require it from time to time. (However, I certainly do not sew over pins with my serger.)	Regardless of one sews over perependicular pins or not, these clips are still way overpriced. Perhaps quilters are happy with them and  love them for their binding, nonethless, garment sewers who might use these only occassionally can get binder clips and get away much cheaper.
1,They didn't stay sharp for any length of time at all. Used them for cutting jewelry wire and became dull very quick. Still need a good pair. Not happy.
1,Holds a great amount of water/pigment but does not form a nice tip. It is also shedding hairs on the first use.... Returning it
1,I love Lion Brand but this is the absolute worst product I have ever acquired yarn crafting wise.  I would not invest in this product.  the clover or Susan bates ones are so much better and easier to use.  they make making pom poms addicting and fun.  I sometimes just use left over yarn to sit and play at making pom poms.  I have bags of them and they are hanging all over my house.  This is the only Lion Brand item i have ever come across that i did not absolutely love.  I am partial to Lion brand and all their products but I would nto and can not recomment this product.
1,sorry for 1 star, but I paid $15 for this snips and those worked for about 2 weeks then it don't cut a thread any more
1,I expected a softer, more flexible thimble, perhaps something similar to a silicone oven mitt. These are more like a harder plastic. Not very comfortable for me, as the edges dig in and seem a little sharp.
1,They fall off
1,Do not buy these. Most of them are dried up or nearly dried up, and all of them are scratchy, as well as being mislabeled - all of them read "neon" -- Regrettable purchase.
1,I've decoupaged in the past and purchased this to cover an ugly box with fabric.  I followed the directions according to the package.  However, I was disappointed to find after 2 days of "drying" time it left my project sticky.  I have not ever had this issue before with the original formula of Mod Podge.
1,Don't work properly in a Quattro 6000D  Jump up and down
1,They say that they are woodless but they are not woodless.  They are covered in wood and they are fairly hard.  I was really expecting them to be woodless and was really disappointed.  They were for a gift so I gave them but if I would have had time, I would have sent them back.
1,very difficult to line up
1,Much thinner that they used to be, very bendy, nearly impossible to use, will be tossing asap and hunting for something sturdier
1,I followed the directions exactly and the dye did not hold. The shirt ended up very faded.
1,They were dry upon arrival.
1,Not as great as I had hoped for. The paint does "charge" and will illuminate in the dark.... but not very bright and not for very long. As other reviews said, the paint goes on and dries almost clear, slightly opaque and a little "gritty". These are the luminescent particles in the paint. Given other reviews I had hoped the paint was a little clearer as I could paint over colors so you could not see it, then it would illuminate when the lights went out. It did come with a little keyfob light (maybe UV ?) that seemed to charge it up pretty quick, but charging with ambient lighting did not seem to work very well at all.
1,Very rough and to small for what I needed
1,not good
1,I am a hand quilter and thought I would give these a try.....I can thread a needle but these are ridiculous.  Not even a needle threader would work and I ended up using a magnifying glass that was attached to my lamp.  They are smooth and thin and I really did like the way they went in and out of my layers, the container is cute and when you want a needle you end up pouring out many.....so be careful!
1,These scissors are ok, but definitely not as sharp or of as nice quality as advertised. If you're just looking for some craft scissors, they'll be fine, but if you want something nice, these are not it!
1,I bought these for a very specific small space I wanted to put a pair of scissors into, that could take a max length of 2.75". These scissors are labeled as 2.5" but they are NOT, they are clearly 3" scissors. If you are okay with a 3" pair then these may be fine, keep in mind they are designed as a VERY compact set of scissors so aren't going to be easy to use particularly for someone with larger hands, but the additional length is in the grips so probably work better than a true 2.5" pair would. They do cut easily and are nice and sharp. They are just NOT the size that is advertised, so I have to buy something else since they don't fit my available storage space.
1,I was so excited to use this punch. I got maybe 20 punches of regular paper, and the punch came out of alignment. metal was hitting metal. my brother had to mess with it for 30 minutes or so with his knife until it would punch again, but now it leaves an ugly tag/ragged edge around the bottom of Mickey's head that I have to clean up with scissors.
1,The end caps did not fit my tools. And I was so looking forward to green rather than baby colors. Oh well. The scraper works like a champ though!
1,I thought it would "easily" remove the residue from my iron. Not easy at all. The instruction says to repeat the process if needed, but 3 or 4 times? My residue wasn't so bad, but after 4 times, I just decided to gently scrape off the last bit with a straight edge. To be fair, it did remove most of the residue, but not all. It's a small tube so if you keep repeating the process, this will probably be good for only about 3 uses. It also gives off a nasty chemical smell, the kind that smells carcinogenic. Not pleasant at all. My husband actually thought something plastic was burning. I read somewhere that a vinegar solution works wonders and is safer for the health. I should try that.
1,Very small only good if your felting little projects
1,I had high hopes for this wood burner and did a lot of research prior to purchasing. Unfortunately, the third time i went to use it, the tip sheared off with he threaded portion still in the machine, rendering it unusable until i can maybe get it out, and of course that tip, the most commonly used one, is now unusable. Very dissatisfied not to mention ive got several projects on hold now with my wood burner...
1,Spend your money on a better brand, these are not very well colored, and so many of them don't have the hotfix attached on the back that it is a pain to keep removing the duds from my designs.
1,They are not good. When I try to take them off the project they break. Not happy with them.
1,The sellers price is nearly double the suggested retail price. I believed this was a Super Size skein but it was only a regular 7 oz skein. I wouldn't pay this price again for cheap acrylic yarn.
1,This is literally two sheets of 8.5 x 11 chipboard.  This is designed to use with The Cinch machine.  I don't have a Cinch.  My purpose was to use it to make handmade journals.  I can buy 12 x 12 sheets of chipdboard at the local craft store for 59 cents a sheet, so this was definitely not a good buy for my need.  I received less product and paid way more.  I will never buy this again.  The chipboard itself was soft and dented easily.
1,In all fairness the seeds are really nice and I like the colors, but I did not expect the bags they come in would be sooooooo small.  I can only do one project per bag which is not good.  I will not buy from them again.
1,This product did NOT stamp well at all. My first clear stamps I ever purchase were by Lawn Fawn and Avery Elle (much, much better) at a local stamp store. I asked the store clerk about the quality of clear stamps because I only knew of red rubber stamps. The woman in the store said the quality of clear stamps had gotten better but there were still some that were not very good. This I think is what she was talking about. These stamps are terrible. I used a few different inks; dye inks, pigment inks, different brands of such, and then different types of paper. I could not get a nice solid image with any one of these stamps in the set. They just didn't work, and they are thin and flimsy. Better brands are thicker. Are all BoBunny stamps like this? Not sure, But I wouldn't recommend this product to any stamper. Please let me know if this review was helpful.
1,These break very easily! Not happy.
1,Oh, dear, Singer 9960.		I did my research and saved my pennies and finally purchased this machine as an upgrade from an older manual Singer model. When I first purchased this machine about a year ago, I was in love! It was so quiet and sewed perfectly, every time. I couldn't get over how straight it sewed with barely a touch. It has so many great stitches and is just so smooth!		Ah, but the honeymoon is over. Starting last fall (6 months after purchase), I started having MAJOR tension issues. As in, the top of my stitching looks great, but underneath it's a loopy mess that resembles a bath towel. Google to the rescue! Turns out all I need to do is rethread the machine. No problem, right? Over and over and over I rethread, and over and over and over, it works fine for a bit and then goes haywire again. Grr. I didn't buy a sewing machine so I could  practice my threading, I bought it so I could sew!		Anyway, I have a work-around that involves using the bobbin tension knob. It's not idea and can't be adjusted, but it gives me something to work with. I sew a lot and have no time to deal with this. The tension malfunction may be something that can be fixed by a sewing machine repair person, but I live in SoCal and an authorized repair center is an hour away at least. Plus, I shouldn't have to take in a BRAND NEW machine!		I do not recommend this machine.
1,Was going to buy these for 12.95 when my deposit posted to my card tonight, but went back to add them to my cart and they have over doubled in price in a day. No way I will pay almost thirty bucks for no name hooks when I can pay 5 dollars more and buy the clover brand set right on Amazon, the brand of hooks these are modeled after. Why pay almost just as much for an imitator when you can buy authentic for almost they exact same price. At 12 something a set I was excited about these but not for any amount over 20
1,Disappointed. All very small and similar sized. Does not work well as a bunch but a single would Look OK with a person/ animal holding it or in a bouquet of flowers. Will not be used often.
1,I guess these came from China. Which I would have not done anyway if I'd realized ( on purpose anyway) becasue of the lax regulations in their shops. Lord knows what's in those pins.. BUT even without that, these were horrible and unusable.. Most were bent into a U shape to get into the tiny package instead of laid out flat. Making them flat again was impossible.. Then I realized when I put beads on the head part was off center.. And off angle... Finally through them away! Do not waste your money on these... TERRIBLE PRODUCT!!		Susan
1,Not really useful for many projects.  Kind of a waste of time and money for me.
1,when i was reading comments, i was thinking: I'm lucky, I will get what i gonna order...	Instead i got on time 2 round and 1 heart punches at least the heart punch doesn't cut well... that is not so big money but i prefer to help someone then just throw away any money. I'd turn back this special item, but unfortunatelly to pay x4 times more than the cost... so if you need only disapointings so buy it... or think twice before do it.
1,Nice, a bit big
1,This item does NOT fit a Brother machine.
1,not the right color
1,Although this shows the gold plaid band for paper/photo what I received was the red plaid band with the Kraft backing to the adhesive.  This is for paper/general purpose and I have used this before and the adhesive does not come off of the Kraft easily and also balls up.  I specifically wanted the gold plaid and feel deceived that what was shown is not what I received.
1,Wow Grafix, what have you done to your plastic?  This is like the 4th or 5th 50 pack I've ordered over the past three years and I have NEVER had such horrible results.  When I opened my most recent pack, the first thing I noticed was how much thinner the sheet felt compared to the previous packages.  Then I told myself 'no, you're just imagining things'.  Sadly I wasn't.  I sand my plastic before drawing on it and noticed during sanding that there were wavy looking areas, but went ahead with it (and sanded 25 sheets!!!).  Then, I drew my images and cut out with an oval shaped punch to make charms for jewelry.  The charms curled up like Pringles!  Usually, the charms curl, then flatten back out during baking.  I then press flat with a book when I take them out of the oven.  These charms never were able to go completely flat, even when applying great force with a heavy book.  The charms were wavy and wrinkled at the edges, nothing that I could possibly sell and my artwork wasted.  What have you guys done?  I bought 2 packages in December!  Please fix this.  Until that time, people buy Shrinky Dink brand white plastic or Lucky Squirrel brand.
1,Fortunately these will not be used for embroidery. They are worthless for that.  They do not fit together at all well. They are splintery, not smooth.  Poorly made, cheep.
1,Ordered and the carrier refused to deliver because the package was damaged.  When I attempted to reorder the price from the supplier (Five Star Savings) had gone up, and there was a  notice the item was under review and was not available at this time.  I would recommend ordering it elsewhere.
1,Wish I had read the one star reviews. My old Singer Curvy has the loose bobbin case that seems to be a common problem. Still sews, but stitches don't have that nice precise look. I saved up and bought this one and was so pleased when it arrived last week. I tried some of the stitches on several fabrics and every seam was gathered--tension too tight, I'm thinking. So I tried using the controls to loosen tension--no help. So I ironed and tried ignore the problem (quilting). Next I had the problem with the feeds snatching the fabric when beginning a seam, as another reviewer commented. I started my seams further in. Bummer. The next day the bobbin started tangling and  jamming. I cleared it and started over....and over and over and...then it stopped sewing completely. I've had it less than a week and used it only on two occasions. What a hunk of junk. I'm so disappointed. Don't waste your money. I'm finishing my quilt with my old Singer Curvy.
1,Being new to the paper crafting scene, I bought this trimmer with high hopes only to be disappointed. The blades do not last, even while cutting through one sheet of paper at a time, and I went through two blades within the first week! Save your money and buy a better grade trimmer. (I did!)
1,Was out of package in plastic bag.	Extra erasers absent.	Warehouse buy, best to go with manufacturer.
1,Doesn't work
1,Not even passable as a real stone of any sort. This faux turquoise is really terrible- solid color, off-color, with white below the surface. It just looks super cheap. Sad. Wont purchase from this maker again just because I cant tell if Ill get a real stone or someone trying to pass a fake one off as real.
1,Came out light blue on 100% cotton. I hade to re-dye with Azue Ble and turned out a nice jean color!
1,The product description said they were made of pressed board, which would have been perfect.  What I received was cards made of thin plastic sheet, which was not.  Unfortunately, I was on vacation in NY when we opened the package and it was not really possible for me to start a return from there.
1,The thread kept breaking towards the end.  I was getting frustrated.
1,The bristles are short and fried with hairs pointing in all directions.  I just use it now for blending as that is the only practical use for it.
1,Stencil sucks and is not easy to use.  The areas to ink are too small.
1,I bought this at Michael's Craft Store, with a 40% off coupon, bringing it down to about $6.00.. and although it may look convenient, if you have ANY sewing skills whatsoever, I would HIGHLY recommend just sewing something by hand instead of spending the money on this handheld sewing machine.  It's not worth the money or the hassle in trying to get it to work.  It's really loud too, and takes 4 AA batteries, which makes it pretty klunky to hold.
1,This marker was hard to use. The ink flowed at different consistencies making it impossible to have the label readable. I had a white Sharpie paint marker on hand that did the trick.
1,These were too slippery for me and dis not have enough of a curve to keep the stitches secure.  I bought some plastic  ones that worked better.
1,If you can get the tape off without the backing sticking to it,  it will not stick on anything for longer then a few seconds and then peels up.  Bought this for a special project I was making for a Christmas present and had to start over at the last minute.  You get what you pay for.  The presentation package was good and the patterns were pretty and bright until you peel them off and then the patterns are much lighter.
1,Returned the sewing machine...doesn't fit my sewing table.  Had my original "steel: machine fixed...will far outlast this alleged heavy duty machine.
1,sorta cheep they break easily the 8 year old I got these for with clay broke a few of they pretty easily
1,Wonder if I was ripped off here--No where does it say Kolinsky brushes except on the box.  The round 8 is already losing hairs andw hold a point.
1,I have tried it several times since purchasing it and has been disappointed each time. I even tried to give it to my son to use as practice vinyl, but he gave it back because it was so bad. It does not cut well, nor weed well, and it just did not work like other vinyls we have purchased. If I could, I would return it, but alas, took me too long to thoroughly test it out.
1,It's ok but not the best I have ever had.
1,I have used many different crackle mediums over the years and this is definitely the worst.  In fact I once did a 13' x 13' library, with floor to ceiling bookshelves on all sides, with a crackle finish.  I let this product dry overnight - about 12 hours.  When I put the topcoat on it ran on any surface that wasn't horizontal and the horizontal surfaces look more marbled than crackled.  It's a given that all crackle mediums are finicky but this one is impossible.  I am getting ready for a craft show tomorrow and my display case is ruined.  Wish I could get my money back or had started a month ago so I would have time to sand this all down and repaint.  Very frustrating.
1,after receiving this thick embossing folder with hindges on it.  I tried several ways to use it in my Vagabond and it jammed up my machine.  Then I tried it in my big shot and it wouldn't go all the way through.  I really liked the detail and bought the daisy folder also and cannot use them.  I cut off the hindges on the shell folder but it did not emboss well.	So I am very dissappointed and since I cut off the hindges cannot send them back.  Wasted money and time.
