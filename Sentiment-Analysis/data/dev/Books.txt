0,Very good
0,What a charming story!  All the better because it is "real life".  And of course Mr. Gerrold writes beautifully.
0,This is an amazing book that will totally make you cry but if you're looking for romance this is more like a slow burn with a fizzle.
0,Basketball Legend Wilt Chamberlain ( August 21,1936-October 12,1999) talks about life, sports, movies, politics, history, women and almost everything under the sun in his interesting and fascinating 1991 biography: A view from above. Wilt Chamberlain is without a doubt the greatest basketball player that ever lived and the greatest sports personality of the twentieth century and a great man and humble human being. Wilt Chamberlain talks in the book about how the government should give jobs to poor people to build highways and roads to develop a country`s crumbling infrastructure. Wilt chamberlain says strength he was blessed with and he enhanced it with weightlifting long before it became popular to do so and he arm wrestled the strongest men on earth with unbelievable strength and he never lost. Wilt chamberlain also says he got a lot of girls and had no problem in the romance department and talking to beautiful women. One of his team mates said we are lucky wilt is a nice man, because if we got him angry he could kill us all. Wilt should have talked more about Conan the destroyer (1984) and the making of it and all the fun  he had  working in it with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Andre the giant. Wilt passed away on October 12,1999 at the age of 63 from heart failure and is no longer with us, but he will always be remembered for his strength, athletic abilities, intelligence and impressive height.
0,The book is both visionary and practical.  Outlines how to live and work according to principles of a better, deeper life for an entire community.
0,Have been waiting for this to come out on Kindle. I am a die hard Spencer fan. This is one of her best! At a time when women were to take a background place to a husband she had the courage to divorce to make a better life for her kids. It was a keeper and now is a keeper in my Kindle library
0,Very well developed.  Typical Katherine Forest.
0,Great book. In fact, I think it should replace the Bible. Now that might raise some eyebrows, but I think there is a lot more truth in it, than in the Bible.
0,I loved this book from the very beginning. I love Zayne & Layla's relationship and love them together! Their chemistry is off the charts, and I love how protective Zayne is of Layla.  I can't wait to read the next book in the series
0,UNPLUGGED, a new young adult novel by Donna Freitas, the author of other popular novels such as THE GORGEOUS GAME and SURVIVAL KIT, follows the life of Skylar Cruz, an average girl who lives in the App World, a virtual world where everyone is plugged into the glitz of virtual life from their real bodies. In the App World, citizens are obsessed with celebrities, paying for expensive apps to watch their every move and constantly using apps to modify their appearance into that of models.		At 17, Skylar is supposed to get the chance to unplug and return to the real world during Service, like every 17-year-old in the App World. She hopes to see her mother and older sister for the first time since she was plugged into the App World as a child. However, just before Skylar turns 17, Service is cancelled and the border between the App World and the real world closes. In hopes of seeing her family again, Skylar decides to cross the border illegally, forsaking her surrogate family and her best friend in the App World, Inara. Along the way, Skylar finds people are much more complicated than their first appearances would suggest, and discovers her important role in the politics of both the App World and the real world. In addition, there is a slight element of romance to the novel, as Skylar begins to develop feelings for Rain, another unplugged teen who was a celebrity of the App World.		Freitas new novel is both original and frightening, suggesting humans have become so dependent on their electronics that they wish to become one with them. The detail and thought put into UNPLUGGED makes it well worth the read. Unlike other science fiction novels that discuss new worlds and new technology, there is no confusion for the reader as Freitas world-building feels clear and seamless. Although Skylars role as a heroine feels a bit cliched, the beautiful imagery of novel negates the sometimes cheesy characters. The imagination behind the idea of two worlds, one virtual and one real, poses interesting questions that reflect upon the dependence people feel towards technology. One of Freitas biggest accomplishments, however, is how casually she includes characters of color and characters of multiple sexual orientations. Her inclusiveness is another step forward in the diversity of young adult fiction.		UNPLUGGED is perfect for any reader who enjoys science fiction or appreciates a fast-paced, exciting read. Fans of THE HUNGER GAMES or UGLIES will find thems engaged in this novel, and will look forward to the continuing of the series.		Reviewed by Janine C.
0,Richie Cathar is in his early thirties but has never had a 'proper' job. Named after his hippy father's hero, Richard I of England, the Lionheart, he muses often on the former monarch that almost everyone he meets sums up with the words, "wasn't he gay?" or something to that effect. Dissatisfied with his relationship, he is nevertheless disgruntled when the earnest Emily leaves him for another man and less than gentlemanly when she tries to return. I feel that some people may struggle with the book, simply because Richie is not the most likeable of narrators. However, there is nothing which says the heroes of novels must be heroic (or even likeable). Richie manages to gain a research grant and uses his father's old notes to suggest he is looking at the art of the Kingdom of Jerusalem as his topic. In Jerusalem, he meets an attractive Canadian Palestinian journalist, named Noor, and the two fall in love. She has to leave for Cairo and he has a feeling of unease as she drives away. Returning to England, he has not heard from her and her enigmatic aunt is evasive. Before long, he hears she has been kidnapped - and asks how well he really knows her.		This novel shifts between the perspective of Richard I as he searches for the True Cross, Richie's quest to try to discover the True Cross for himself and, along the way, understand his father, his relationship with Noor and other women in his life. I have read most of Justin Cartwright's novels - some have been brilliant, others less so. I feel this is slightly bogged down by a myriad of storylines - spying, politics, romance and historical fiction are all touched upon. However, it is an enjoyable read and Cartwright's novels are always well written.
0,My 10 year old who doesn't like reading, loved this book and was excited about reading it and the subsequent books in the series.
0,This gift of John O'Donohue's work was well loved immediately by a poetess I know, to whom I sent it because she is homebound due to illness.  She finds his works inspiring and well worth reading more than once.	Sybil Blazej-Yee, Librarian, a Children's Book Author and a Dogwalker
0,I love a well-written series, and the Kate Shugak series certainly qualifies!  The state and history of Alaska and it's native people play an important role in each novel.  I read the entire series between Thanksgiving and New Years and can't wait for the new book!  If you enjoy a good exciting story in a gorgeous setting filled with engrossing characters, you don't want to miss the Kate Shugak series!
0,If Arsonists Anonymous' title didn't grab you, then its characters and plot will. This book is full of compelling characters who pull the story forward to create a page-turner I could not put down. Reading doesn't get much more fun than this!
0,Love it!
0,Just as great as the other touchthinklearn books! Really cute animals.
0,Loved it. Can't wait to read the next in the series!	Not your typical story. I am going to get the next book ASAP
0,I never thought I would really like James Patterson, My daughter gave me the first book in this series & said read it. Her & I have pretty much the same taste. I'm so glad i read the book. I'm hooked. I can't wait for the next one to come out, Just curious as to how far up in numbers he will go, because I will keep reading.
0,I was not disappointed by this second book in the Lady Emily series. She improves with every book and look forward to the next.
0,You can usually tell if a book is worth reading if the first sentence grabs you. Well, the first sentence below will definitely grab you by the throat and not let go until the last, totally unexpected one:		"When I finally caught up with Abraham Trahearne, he was drinking beer with an alcoholic bulldog named Fireball Roberts, in a ramshackle joint just outside of Sonoma, California, drinking the heart right out of a fine spring afternoon."		I had read The Last Good Kiss so many years ago that it seemed like the first time all over again when I picked it a few days ago. Fortunately, for me, I appreciated it a lot more now than I did way back when. At that time James Crumley was still alive and would go on to write more books, unfortunately, not all of them featuring Meriwether, Montana's "world weary" PI C. W. Sughrue.		Maybe I have the knack of finding authors whose books grab me who happen to have died back in 2008. The other author is Tony Hillerman.  So what did I read before getting hooked on Crumley and Hillerman? Beats me. They mustn't have been all that entertaining or memorable.		Anyway, many of the reviewers who have given their opinions about The Last Good Kiss here have said just about all there is to be said, so I won't even bother writing about this book's plot and characters. I just wanted to put in my two cents and five stars. I recommend TLGK highly.		* Besides James Crumley, American poet Richard Hugo lived in Missoula. I understand that they were good friends and, I suspect, drinking buddies. It's a shame they are no longer with us.
0,I loved this book. I couldn't put it down.
0,Jill Shalvis pens another sultry read in The Heat Is On.		Bella Manchelli thought she could handle a smoking hot one night stand. She would have if a body hadn't appeared the next day outside her place of employment. To make matters even worse is her one nighter is the cop assigned to the murder.		Detective Jacob Madden was still thinking of the woman that rocked his world when he shows up to a dead body at Edible Bliss Cakes and Pastries. Sitting in the middle of it all is delectable Bella Manchelli.  Jacob knows Bella is innocent but something is going on with the men that Bella had previously dated.		Jacob bows out as the lead detective on the case in order to protect Bella. Spending so much time with her makes him realize that she may be the one he has been looking for all his life.  But Bella is a rolling stone can he be enough to make her stay?		As the bodies start to pile up will their new found relationship survive?		The Heat Is On is packed with sizzling heat and heartfelt emotions.  Jill Shalvis seamlessly blends the romance with the suspense. This book will keep you guessing until the very end.  I am looking forward to the other Madden brother's stories.
0,Very good book, their are some editing problems, that's the 4 star rating, over all a very interesting read. Will be reading more by Casey Hill, she's a great story teller. Great Job!!!
0,Very helpful.
0,Wish he would work on the "Highwayman series"
0,Great book series.
0,The item arrived in reasonable time. I'm thoroughly satisfied with the item.
0,I like the way the way Wyatt and Adrianna's life, though told separately seem to blend together. Her life seem to parallel the experiences of the children and by helping them she eventually sorted out some of her own issues from childhood. The book is beautifully wriiten,face paced, could not put it down until the neatly packaged end.
0,Liked this short story of second chance.  It ran smooth without a lot of melodrama that takes place in so many second chance stories.
0,One of the most beautiful,  captivating books I've had the pleasure to read in a long time. Will be looking for more of her books in the future.
0,Classic titans like the one shot at the end
0,Easy to read and follow along
0,Most of this reference book is good.  Way off on how to remove the presser foot lever.
0,Wow this series just keeps getting better and hotter.  Talk about steam.  Suspense, surprises, secrets, submission, blind folds, etc.  You will love this story.  Lots of surprises and I don't want to be a spoiler... 5 stars.  I received an arc copy of this book and voluntarily chose to review it.
0,I just reread this book and it was great! There is a lot great characters that really bring out the feels! Just read it, you'll be glad you did!
0,This is a very well written technical book that covers not just the nuts and bolts of Heroku but the mindset needed to scale and deploy PaaS applications. The book is logically laid out to cover architectural considerations, datastores, how Heroku works with a range of different languages and also a major section on HTML5 and mobile applications. The scope is extremely broad and I think anyone who's building cloud based systems will gain some insights into not just Heroku but this new paradigm of development generally. Overall this is quite exceptionally put together and it's pretty rare to find a tech book of this caliber, especially on such new technology.
0,There was a little bit of everything!  Very plausible!  A. Great book for young and old.  Pre tens would love this book!
0,The place is England in 1724.  Mankind is subjugated to the rule of seven dissident elven lords, who broke free from their land and came through the gateway that separates the lands.  Having magic and strength on their side, they quickly managed to take over the country and now rule it, each lord in his own territory.		The strongest elven lord, Mor'ded, rules London with an iron hand.  His power is that of fire.  His main general, Dominic Raikes, is also his bastard son.  Dominic is half-human but has learned to suppress any human feeling as Mor'ded just uses it to torture him, killing his pets and friends to teach him not to get attached to anything.		Cassandra is a sheltered young woman who has been raised to become the bride of Dominic.  She also has a secret; she has been trained as an assassin by the Resistance.  The Resistance are those human who want to throw off elven rule and restore the human king.  She is to marry Dominic, and use her relationship with him to get close enough to Mor'ded to kill him.		When they meet, nothing goes as planned.  Cassandra is shocked and humiliated by Dominic's unfeeling treatment of her and his flaunting of his mistresses.  Dominic is determined not to feel anything for Cassandra, knowing that to do so will doom her.  Yet, they both hate and fear Mor'ded and as time goes on, create an alliance to try to defeat him.  Will they be successful before he discovers their feelings and destroys them both?  Can Cassandra and Dominic manage not to fall in love?		The Fire Lord's Lover is Book One of The Elven Lords.  Kennedy has created an interesting world, with enough historical grounding that the reader feels familiar with the background.  The love story has the reader curious and makes them want to read to see how it will work out.  This book is recommended for fantasy readers.
0,Another interesting story of two strong characters who find each other and find that there is yet another person with strange powers.
0,This is a very good book, I really  enjoyed it. A must read. I had trouble putting it down. Read and enjoy.
0,I thoroughly enjoyed this book...couldn't put it down once I started . It is well written with good plot twists and a very plausible story line. The characters are well drawn and likeable. Hoping there is a sequel.
0,I meant to save SPIN for my holidays but peeked at the first page and then devoured it in a weekend. Catherine McKenzie deftly handles the serious subject of addiction with empathy and humor. Its witty and quite wonderful, reminiscent of Jojo Moyes or Marian Keyes and I lost myself in the story.
0,Complimentary copy provided in exchange for honest review.		A good, fun story about the path you think you're supposed to follow throughout life might not be the path you think you want. I really enjoyed this book from start to finish, even though the tone of the story goes through a dramatic change about halfway through the book.		The first half of the book is lightweight and carefree, with plenty of outrageous laugh out loud moments (Sydney's abominable attempts at surfing, with a sand turd as her consolation prize), sexual tension and evolving feelings despite the knowledge that any romance would only be short-lived, as Sydney is only in town for 30 days before she's off to Paris for her next housesitting job.		The second half of the story is where the tone changes, in that Sydney is no longer the carefree young woman we met at the beginning of the book; instead, she's gone through a life-changing experience that has given her a precious gift, but she's no longer completely happy, and ended up settling for second best, all due to lies and miscommunication. For me, the second half was written well enough that I found it easy to go through the ups and downs and the emotional roller coaster that became Sydney's life. I will say that I was shocked by a particular incident that occurred, mainly because I wasn't expecting one of the MC to act that way towards Sydney, that abrupt shift in the character was a bit jarring (to me at least).		I do wish there had been some resolution regarding a minor, albeit very bitchy character, I would have liked to read how her juvenile attempts didn't get her what she wanted, but at the same time her actions are what lead to Sydney's decisions in the second half of the book.
0,Interesting and thought provoking; this book is unusual, well written and absorbing. It deserves the 5 stars - my teenage daughter is also reading and enjoying it now.
0,Being a Navy man I loved this book. I was saddened by the sacrifice of my shipmates but was proud to read  about their heroism.
0,This is more than a book about work, calling, or life mission - it's a guide you will want to revisit. Goins had done a masterful job of bringing together personal experiences with episodes in the lives of Hemingway, Einstein,Sam Adams, and Steve Jobs. You can read this for simple inspiration or as a guide - either way you will be better for it.
0,My instructor said this is the one golf coach that he would take a lesson from. After thorough explanations of concepts there follows positive and negative feedback drills that are nicely illustrated. There are also links to videos done by Mile Bender. If you want to really want to work on swing changes this may be the book for you.
0,I haven't read a book that wasn't a romance or at least had a romantic story arc in quite a while and usually, to be honest, they don't really capture me and, um, I get easily bored. But not so this time. Right from the first page I was totally sucked in by the engaging writing style of the author, by the unusual and also diverse cast of characters, and by the mystery that is hidden in every pore of the book. Until the end, the reader is learning and discovering, and so I really don't want to take away from your reading experience by telling you too much.		But still, it must be so weird to you, to wake up in a city full of people with superpowers, who really probably shouldnt have themand hearing that any day we might fall into a fire.		Regan aka Killer, one of the main characters, loses his memory after the first chapter and this not only allows for a natural revelation of the background story of Parole, but its also one of the most fascinating character developments Ive ever read. Seriously, for this alone the book is worth it. I also, for some unknown to me reasons, love that he is a lizard.		From the larger cast of characters, I want to introduce you to the additional two I liked the most. Evelyn is a great trans character, one definitely not to be missed.		I am strong, Evelyn whispered to herself, eyes closed. I am brave. I am a goddess who contains multitudes of galaxies. My spirit is infinite, my soul is towering, and my shoes are hella cute. I can do this.		And my heart beats for this incredibly strong and burdened young man, Finn, who finds love with Zilch, a Zombie whom he clearly cant kill ;-)		Hes just a kid that turns into a bomb when hes sad. And you wonder why hes a little off? Permanent state of shell shockand forcing himself to stay happy all the time, to protect the people around him. Nobody can be happy all the time, eventually it gets to be torture.		Theres also a kid with three moms, a mechanical dog, a control freak and coma patient, and an empath burning with emotion.		I sometimes don't like huge casts of characters, especially when the POVs alternate, but this is not the case here. The auctorial narrator has everything in their sight and so it feels whole and complete.		The book is full of vivid imagery, of suspense and mystery, of people finding a family and connection. I loved this book very, very much and I hope there will be more someday, as the authors bio indicates. Highly recommended.
0,Got many books on derivatives, but Kolb's is my favourite one. He covers the topic in a slightly less quantitative way than Hull does and goes straight to all the different derivatives while avoiding any further  explanations like Ito's Lemma etc. I especially liked the part on swaps  with many examples like flavoured swaps or equity swaps. Nevertheless, if  you're looking for a good software, than I would recommend The Complete  Guide to Option Pricing Formulas (build on Excel VBA).
0,I lost track of the number of times I picked to try to read this book.  The beginning was just a little slow, but with a coworkers encouragement to give it another chance, I did, and I loved it!  As you were reading you constantly had the feeling that there was more.  Life is far from perfect.  Thank you,  College Hoover, for letting the world know you can have a really messed up LIFE, and with the love of a friend or your family, you can be alright and happy!  To all the Sky's and Holder's of this world,hold on to the positive and the love of a friend/family.
0,Intriguing, sexy, captivating, mysterious. Definitely a book that I couldn't put down! Looking forward to the rest of the series! The chemistry of the characters seemed genuine. Nothing over the top romantic and definitely not boring. It was easy to put yourself in their shoes! I received a copy of the book for free to review but that did not affect the outcome of my review.
0,I originally read "The Lord of the Rings" eight years ago, when I was eleven years old. While I understood and enjoyed some of the story, I wasn't old enough to truly get into it. A couple of months ago, I was browsing a local bookstore and ran across the leather-bound Collector's Edition. While it held a hefty price tag, I've always been a big fan of high-quality, solid-feeling items. Especially books. So, I purchased it and read the story for the second time in my life... It was even better than I remember it as a child.	The bottom line is that if you're looking for a long-lasting piece of literature (physically and mentally), the Collector's Edition is the book for you and is completely worth the price you'll pay.
0,I pre-ordered this book and waited not-so-patiently for it to show up on my Kindle for what seemed like months. I've read and loved all of Jojo Moyes books and promised myself I would take my time and not rush through this one.  Unfortunately I let myself down miserably--just couldn't get enough of this story.  I fell in love with the characters--identified and cheered Jess through the joys and terrors of single parenthood and the slow clumsy process of falling in love.  As in all of her previous work, Moyes builds her characters so completely, you feel as though you know them. The story line is richly descriptive and layered, portraying complex albeit common family dynamics. As the book came to an end I cursed myself for reading it too quickly and now am forced once again to wait patiently for her next story.
0,Are environmentalists commonly prejudiced? Do they practice environmental cleansing for the sake of environmental purity? Pearce gives a critical look at our latest wave of wars on plants and animals: the supposedly ecological battles to eliminate foreign species, protect native life forms from competition, and perhaps restore pieces of the landscape to how they were at some point in the distant past. For Pearce, all this bears a disturbing resemblance to our efforts at ethnic cleansing or our traditionalist movements for restoring human cultures to how they were generations ago. He makes a rational, well researched case for going with the flow and letting the most successful creatures succeed, rather than fighting an uphill battle to keep life from changing.
0,Taking place in the 1930s, I Capture the Castle is the story of Cassandra Mortmain, the daughter of James Mortmain, an author who once wrote an important and celebrated novel. Unfortunately, James has not been able to write for many years, ever since he was sent to prison for three months for knocking down a neighbor after a misunderstanding involving a cake knife. The Mortmain family - James, second wife and artists model, Topaz, older daughter and beauty, Rose, Cassandra, son, Thomas, and Stephen, the orphaned son of the familys deceased maid  live in the crumbled ruins of a castle on which they have stopped paying rent. They have sold all of their possessions and barely have enough money to survive. Then their neighbor dies, leaving the castle and the neighboring estate, Scoatney, to his estranged American grandson, Simon Cotton, who comes to live at Scoatney along with his brother, Neil and his mother. The Cotton family is smitten with the Mortmain family, and nothing will ever be the same for either family. Cassandras coming-of-age story is told through the entries in her diaries.		I thought this was a beautifully written book. Dodie Smith does a fantastic job of letting Cassandras thoughts and feelings flow onto the paper. We see Cassandras growth throughout the book as she progresses through the six-penny journal to the shilling journal and finally to the two-guinea journal as she records her thoughts. We share her hopes and dreams, and happy and sad memories as she tries to navigate growing up in a family struggling to survive, yet endeavoring to live a normal life. Cassandra seems to be the practical one of the family as she tries to help her father write again, schemes with Rose to find a husband, and struggles with Stephens feelings for her, as well as her growing feelings for another. It is both a humorous and poignant portrayal of a young girl finding her way in the world, as she also helps and cares for those around her. The novel also examines the English class system and compares English versus American traditions.
0,Great Book.  Love the ending.  It took me to another place in the world. I couldn't put the book down wanting to know what happened next.
0,Although it was easy to determine early in the book who the bad guys were , the writer did a very good job in planting suspicions about several making reader doubt the accuracy of his prjected possible bad guys .  Sand held a degree of excitement to the bloody end
0,Molly Taiden is Great story teller I have read almost all her stories and loved them. This book is great. About a man that does not remember anything and a woman who grows to love a wonderful man.
0,Amazing book. Bought it twice.
0,BagofBones	Wonderful story laced with Mayan history. The Fargos make thestory sound so true. It is a marvelous adventure through Guatemala.
0,Another great book in the Mercy-verse. I was a little worried about 3/4 of the way into the book when it seemed like Patty wouldn't have enough time to wrap the story (one of my pet peeves is when authors tie it all up in the last 5 pages), but I shouldn't have worried. It didn't feel rushed or anemic at all. I was surprised by the type of supernatural villain and enjoyed the ending.
0,RETURN TO PROMISE by Debbie Macomber was a delightfully entertaining story filled with romance, humor, mystery and adventure.
0,Really nice for me.  Want to get more veggies into my diet and this is a practical way to do it.  Do not use a juicer, but there are plenary of recipes for my vitamix blender!
0,Intricate and unusual.
0,Excellent book, good condition.
0,(Ok this is my 2nd attempt at a review. I lost the first one, so let's see if I can get everything down again).	Wow, that was some sort of cliffhanger Miss Raine! I am so on the edge of my seat, I can't stand waiting for #3 to come out. In #2 we continue to see the development of Chase & Allie's relationship, but we see twists and turns that you won't see coming. I feel so torn writing this review, because I don't want to give anything away. However, if I don't say anything g you won't know how INCREDIBLE #2 is. Think: further relationship of C & A, continued mystery between MC & stepfather and add in new players with ramping up the drama. PHEW!  It was something and can't wait for #3.
0,I love Isaac Bell!
0,The Purchase is a story of a young widower who is driven by circumstance to move to the American frontier (Western Virginia in the late 1700's). Responsible for his own young children and almost-equally-young new wife, he knows little of what he is getting into. His naivete and reliance on an imperfectly-formed faith soon complicate matters, starting with the unplanned purchase of a slave boy. He and his family do manage to adapt and make a life in their new environment, each in their own way, but it is not easy. The difficulties of life in a harsh environment are made clear, but the institution that pervades and dominates the story is that of slavery. The family's experience of reluctant slave-ownership, the surrounding community, slave-owning or otherwise, and the lives of the slaves themselves all feature in this finely-written but inevitably grim novel. It is often painful, and it is intended to be, but there is a core element of compassion that ultimately leaves one with a sense of cautious hope.
0,So many twists and turns, I truly loved all of the wonderful books in this series. I am a little bit sad to see it end, but what a awesome ending it was. Thank you guys for telling me a wonderful and exciting story.
0,Another great work by Lisa See. In some parts a bit repetitive but overall a great read! Can't wait for her next book.
0,I love the characters and the story line of this book. Read the book in one day  so glad I was on vacation .
0,The story continues!  Im so inlove with this series. Pepper Winters never fails to impress. Hanging by the edge for the next book!!
0,My abs may never recover.		Nancy Rue has created one of my favourite characters of the year, 42-yr-old Allison Chamberlain, a character who had me laughing out loud many times throughout this fabulous book.		Allison has been a Christian for seven years, trying to figure out exactly what following Jesus looks like. One Sunday she is sitting restlessly in her pew when she receives a divine nudge - literally - and hears God telling her to go buy a Harley. When she decides to follow this bizarre calling, she soon finds herself well out of her comfort zone, learning to handle a hog, and encountering God's people in a challenging but eternally satisfying way.		This first book in the Reluctant Prophet Trilogy will make you smile, laugh, maybe even cry, as you contemplate this wonderful journey of life that God is guiding us through. Despite the gender difference, I found myself really relating to Allison, especially in her reluctance to acknowledge God's voice (He's not actually asking me to do that is he?). Not only was I thoroughly entertained by this novel, but I was challenged as well, to step outside of myself and what I'm comfortable with, and to follow God's leading, no matter how strange (and no doubt wonderful!) that will be.		The book absolutely flew by, and I struggled to even be able to put it down. Nancy Rue is a highly skilled author, and has delivered an amazing read that engaged me on all levels. I absolutely cannot wait to find out what happens in the next book in the series.		I highly recommend this book and give it 5 out of 5 stars.		An egalley of this book was provided from the publisher via Netgalley, for the purposes of this unbiased review.
0,well writen
0,Monster in my closet was all together a fun book. A Zoey is a quirky character, who finds out not everyone can read each other's emotions and that not every thing that goes bump at night is imaginary.  I really enjoyed this and can't wait to find out what else comes to pay Zoey a visit. (;
0,I loved the story because it keeps you transfixed from start to finish. The author does a great job with keeping you interested and anxious for the next chapter!
0,This book is about a Mormon couple, written by the same couple of their courtship and life with emphasis on building a successful marriage and how they did so for themselves.  The centrality of their lives and their married life is their Mormon faith, all well and good and this can be a cornerstone for some couples, not for others.  There are many parts of the book that offer good advice and insights.  Some parts less so.		So I do not know whether to give this book one star or five stars or maybe average it and give three stars.		Lets start with one star:  This book advocates continuing to go on weekly dates after marriage, and many other activities e.g.  at least weekly church activities, watching television together and lots of quality time at home.  No mention of the demands of a career, except to make sure it does not compromise family life; no mention of building adequate financial security for retirement or for education of the children, including higher education.  Family comes first in terms of time and attention, and perhaps the practical considerations of life are supposed to magically occur.  The cover has an attractive, sexy woman, one of the authors, with tattoos on her arm and foot, with an ecstatic appearing smile cuddled up to a very handsome sort of GQ dressed man (her husband), the other author of the book with socks that are orange, pink and green.  One hot couple.  The wife is a book author and speaker at various Mormon oriented events.  The gentlemans bio on the last page, says that he has a personal growth website and blog.  They are the parents of two children.  Somehow, sounds like fantasy land.		What about the high points.  I think there is considerable good advice, especially for couples who are dating or engaged.  The book is a good primer about cultivating the connection of marriage, from different types of love involved in family, and how to make sure these interactions are regarded and treated as precious.  It involves such topics as conflict and emphasizes tools of communication and how to facilitate constructive engagements between husband and wife.  The book handles issues such as adversities.  The authors religious convictions and their goal to help others are summarized nicely on the last page, Because its life that should be hard, not marriage.  Its marriage that should make the hard things in life easier because you have each other and because you have God.		Oh yes.because of the strong finish, I will assign four stars.
0,It covers a great deal of information that helps one see what shaped Tutu into the Christian and leader the world knows.
0,love it
0,I like it, not sure what my 7 y.o. will think, I think she'll love it
0,A fascinating book on a very dark subject.  All Americans should read this book to understand what our warriors go through and how they must then find away to fit back into society.
0,I am a psychotherapist specializing mainly in eating disorders and problems related to anxiety and depression.  I have spent years searching for an "accessible" book about these important existential issues. When I recommend other books related to meaning in life/ spirituality/meditation my patients tend to come back disappointed.  More often than not, they won't even get through a few chapters, because of the flightly metaphors and "new agey" feel.  While Singer also uses metaphors, his metaphors are clear, simple and make abstract concepts more concrete (and therefore more accessible to my patients.)  He only gets "new agey" with his discussion on energy, but by that point he's hooked you with such rational explanations, my  skeptics just skim right over it.  I can sometimes spend an entire session discussing a patient's "inner roommate" described in the beginning of his book.  This book finally explains complex and difficult topics in a way my patients are able to understand and utilize.  I can speak for at least 3 patients (thus far), as well as for myself--this book can be a life-changer and at the very least spark some very productive therapy sessions!
0,Absolutely phenomenal!!! Cassandra Clare did it again!!! her stories are always the best and the Infernal Devices are absolutely no different in this!
0,This book is well-written and balanced. Best of all, it's frank and truthful.		As I have struggled to be a working mom, I often feel alone. My coworkers and bosses without children JUST DON'T GET IT. I wish everyone would read this book. And my favorite part is that she included a brief list of ways we can act to ameliorate the situation here in the US.
0,I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.		This book put me through an emotional wringer.  It was all just heart breaking.  The main characters are Jamie, Blake, and Sylvie.  Jamie died of a drug overdose.  Blake saw it coming and hated Sylvie because he was under the impression that Jamie used because of her.  Sylvie was so broken up by Jamie's death, but she hid her grief with sex.  That's what Sylvie does when her emotions are out of control, she has sex.  It's also what broke up Sylvie and Jamie, well that and his drug use.  Blake also used sex to dull his reaction to Jamie's death and his unexpected feelings for Sylvie.  I hated all the misconceptions Blake had.  I really just wanted to throw my Kindle across the room at the thoughts he had about her without even knowing her.  Sylvie never had a chance to defend herself to him, and that made me want to just sit down and start crying.		Overall, this was a great introduction to characters that I can't wait to read more about.  It was well-written, fast-paced, and gave me just enough to get me hooked.  I do have to say that it's a whole lot of sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll.		4-Bombs	Reviewed by Tracy
0,I felt such sadness when looking at the destruction and decay of these beautiful, and now historical old homes.  I also felt and saw the grandeur of each home and imagined what they looked like when they were new.  I am fascinated with the architecture of southern homes.  A fine book to add to any library collection.
0,I have read every book written by Daniel Silva. I enjoyed each one. Love the characters,Love the storyline.	Start with the first book and you will be hooked.
0,Wonderful book. Captured me right away and held my attention through out!
0,I haven't tried any of them yet, but they all look amazing. I can't wait to get started. Thank You for offering this book.
0,Would give it 100 stars. Life changing!
0,I loved this book. The blind French girl and the remarkable German boy whose individual stories come together beautifully at the end. Most of the book centers on how the lives of each of these two evolve between 1940 and 1944. But it also moves back and forth between this background and a very few days in August of 1944 in the remarkable French town of Saint-Malo, where most of the story concludes. (And if you are not familiar with Saint-Malo I would strongly recommend googling some photos of it. Beautiful.) Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
0,Not your momma's romance story!  This one is hot, dirty, gritty, and will have you fanning yourself!  Hugh has not had it easy, but has finally straightened his life out and moved forward, well until his dad's problems become his.  Shay is also dealing with issues thanks to her family and a bad breakup.  Sometimes when you least expect to find happiness and love, you bump into it.  This story is terrific and keeps you on the edge of your seat through every twist, turn, and swerve!  Great start to what promises to be a really good series!
0,I truly couldn't put this series down once I started to reading. I decided to rate this series after finishing all three books and this one was my favorite. The story was told with such emotion , at times I had a pit  in my stomach, other times a smile you couldn't slap off my face. GREAT READ!
0,*sigh*	Get comfortable, because once start this series you won't be able to stop! Gave & Ivy's story is filled with laughter, suspense & just the right amount of steamy goodness.  The side characters are intriguing & worth getting their own story. Definitely will be keeping up with JB Heller!
0,I read some of the other reviews for When Passion Rules by Johanna Lindsey before I knew I was reviewing it myself. They were all over the place. What I found interesting is that those that did not rate the book very high wrote very unkind reviews. It's those kinds of reviews that are not helpful to readers. They are not helpful to authors either. Honest, constructive opinions win out over malicious, unhelpful negativity every time.		I am a longtime fan of Ms. Lindsey's writing. She brings to life a historical romance in such a way that I feel as though I am right there in her stories. When Passion Rules is no exception. This is a sweet historical romance that I found refreshing.		Alana was raised by a man she thought was her uncle. Educated in the ways of male nobility, including weaponry, Alana was capable of protecting herself with her mind as well as her hand. I loved that she was intelligent and handy with a dagger. What I loved more was that Ms. Lindsey did not go over the top with Alana's character having her physically fight a bunch of battles or be so far out of place during that time that she was unbelievable.		Our hero, Christoph, is smart and very good at being in charge. After past attempts of imposters claiming to be the King's daughter, Christoph arrests Alana, keeping her close to him. Although he believes Alana is not who she says she is, he listens to her. They have great conversations. The attraction between the two is felt. There may not be as much passion as the title states, but it's there. After many twists and turns, I didn't see coming, the truth comes out.		The ending came quickly thereafter and all loose ends were answered. I enjoyed how Ms. Lindsey found a way for there to be many facets of the happily ever after. I would give away too much of the story if I explained this further. I guess to see what I'm talking about you need to go get this book and read it!		When Passion Rules, a sweet romance that made me think and try to figure out the truth. I really liked it and I think you will too...		Angeline gives When Passion Rules 4.5 stars and is a recommended read.
0,When I bought the book I didn't realize it was for children and not adults. However, I will say that while it is not what I needed, it is a wonderful tool to get the kids into the habit of writing. If I were a teacher looking for a innovative way to teach a writing class, I would use this book.
0,Buddhist monastery meets Sherlock Holmes!		What an odd premise for a mystery book. But then again, why not?		The protagonist, Tensing Norbu, (or "Ten" for short) is a modern day enigma. In one person, Ten incorporates both Old & New Worlds.		His parents expected him to be a Buddhist monk. His calling was otherwise, for Ten has a knack for solving mysteries.		So, now, here he is in (of all places) Los Angeles- a grand melting pot of the modern day world.		Formerly of the LAPD, Ten decides to embark on his own as a private investigator. Many of the rigid things he dislike at the Monastery hold true at the LAPD. (Who would think those two systems had anything in common?)		But, Ten is an iconoclast-both in his old world and in his adoptive new home.		Travel along with him as Ten makes his way as a Private Investigator and develops new rules of Ten.		This is an enjoyable fast paced read.  Well deserving of 5 stars. Enjoy!
0,Read with an open heart.  Be prepared for confrontation.	Everything a wife has been crying for her husband to be, but in the process of making that man into what she deems he should be has crushed the essence of who a man is.	Find yourself as you have never known before.
0,Cutest funniest dog ever - love the book
0,I love all Patricia Briggs books!

0,Great writing.
0,When Hostile Hospital begins it appears John Cesari is just another thug following orders for the mob. Luckily for us he turns out to be so much more. A gastroenterologist battling hospital  beauracracy and his past at the same time, he takes us on a madcap ride through small town NY as he tries to stay ahead of the local police, the mob, and even the FBI while protecting his new found love. Avanzato has created a compelling character in Dr. Cesari, I hope we will be reading many more of his adventures. Recommended for readers that liked Anthony Bourdain's early fiction books.
0,Keeps you guessing. The great thing bout these books is they are their own story. You can jump right in and not feel lost.
0,Great read!!!
0,A quick, fun read.
0,Love Lisa and Francesca.
0,Jason Andrew Bond has put together a very enjoyable scifi tale with a unique plot. I love the idea of a shipbreaker in the future, handling spacecraft that are deliberately crashed to earth, and he weaves an interesting story into one of those crashes. I spent longer than I thought each night reading; Bond does a nice job of keeping the action and flow going. The protagonist had, in my opinion, quite a dark side, something I didn't expect from the 'hero', but still it was a very good read. Looking forward to his next one, hopefully within this same universe.
0,What a treat!. I started this hoping for a mystery/thriller with humor. What a great find. While it stretches the imagination a bit (just make a leap of faith) I really really enjoyed it. So glad I have the trilogy to look forward too. Love the characters, loved the dialogue interplay and just the relentless pushing forward of Bunny.
0,I loved this book. There was a feeling of unease from the first moments. It's really well written and enjoyable. I look forward to reading more from this author.
0,great photos
0,Wow! I fell in love with this series. Loved the concept, wonderful characters with its paranormal twist. I admit, this book made me frustrated and hurt so many times but it was so worth it with its kick-a* epilogue and HEA. I loved Shane & Grace. Their story might be emotionally draining but awe inspiring. A story that would make you believe in soul-mates, miracles and true love that conquers all and goes beyond forever.		Christine Zolendz delivered a wonderful story with solid plot, a lot of witty banters, coupled with steamy scenes and great characters that kept me captivated and entertained from start to finish.		Highly recommended.

0,If you love a great love story this is for you.		I loved the characters Olivia and Dean so real and you totally buy into their story, real life events that could and do happen in everyday life.		Read it you will not be disappointed then move onto 'Allure' book 2.
0,This may be simply the most beautifully written book I have ever read.  And I have been reading 4 or 5 books a week for the past 47 years.  The prose is so good it often spills over into poetry so lyrical I wanted to cry.		People may or may not like the story, which is complex and dark.  I obviously did like it; I read the book in one sitting, and it's 500-some pages.  But whatever you may think of the story, you should not miss this book if you love beautiful writing.		It's hard for me to believe this is a first novel.  It is a tour de force, beautifully plotted as well as beautifully written.
0,This series is one of my all time favorites.  I really enjoyed seeing his perspective on everything that happened. S C Stephens is such a talented writer. I can't wait to read Untamed as soon as its available. I only wish she had more published works!
0,I have to start by saying a massive thank you to Kate at Bibliophile Book Club for raving on about this authors books and making me take a chance on it.		Even though I have heard quite a lot of good things about this novel I was very dubious to try it for myself as I have to admit to not being a fan of novels that have been translated as find they don't always tend to flow very well. I had nothing to worry about though with this book as it flowed wonderfully.		The story itself is wonderfully atmospheric and beautifully written. The description of the small Icelandic village that Ari Thor ends up finding himself was very much brought to life by the author.		The whole storyline felt a bit like something out of Midsummer Murders apart from it being set in a small idyllic village in Iceland. It didn't have the feel of the gritty crime novels that I am used to reading but do you know what, I didn't mind. If anything it makes Snowblind very much stand out from other books in the same genre.		Ari Thor is fairly new to being a policeman and even though he is very much still 'wet behind the ears' I actually thought he did a pretty good job in his new role and out of all the the police officers in the village if anything was ever to happen to me it would certainly be Ari Thor I would want to be send to investigate.		Snowblind wasn't my normal fast paced crime read but that made me appreciate the beauty of this novel even more. Will certainly be adding Nightblind to my reading list as can't wait to see what is in store for Ari Thor.
0,This is the second book from Tiner we have used for school. We've been very happy with both of them. They are engaging, current, and give enough information to get my kids (16 and 13) excited about the topics. The chapters have a few study questions at the back, good enough to ping their brains to see if they retained what they read. There are also some more in depth questions calling for additional research of figures discussed in the chapters Some of the questions require upper math and physics skills.  This is definitely appropriate for high school students.	We are using this as a unit study for Astronomy. It easily meets the need of a spine for a unit study. I'm adding another book with some star charts and a few outings with our telescope to complete what's required to make this a high school semester course.
0,Last week there were a couple of Kindle edition Heyer books on sale for $1.99.  This one, written in 1950, is one of my personal favorites and I already had it in hardcopy and have read and reread it many a time over the years so I snapped up the Kindle version.  It's a lovely, fluffy, comfort and escape read for me.		It's a particular favorite of mine because of the heroine.  She's a take-charge, manipulative, managing heroine who manages people to her satisfaction but also to their betterment.  She cares what happens to them and is certain she knows what is best for them.  (Usually she's right.)  Yes, she comes on strong and could be somewhat annoying (Just ask her cousin Charles) but she's delightful and refreshing at the same time.		This is quite funny.  You can't skim a Heyer book if you want to get maximum pleasure.  Heyer skewers society foibles and silly behavior and has a great time while doing it and supplies us with a great read.  But make no mistake.  This is not great literature.  Heyer herself said about her books:  "I think myself I ought to be shot for writing such nonsense...But it's unquestionably good escapist literature and I think I should rather like it if I were sitting in an air-raid shelter or recovering from flu."		Two things I always have to ignore when reading a Heyer novel relate to the time period setting of the novels and the time when the novels were written.  They contain two things that my 21st-century sensibilities object to:  1)Anglo-Saxon exceptionalism with off-hand denigration of Jews and, in this story, of Spaniards, and 2) marriage between first cousins, which was perfectly acceptable then.  I ignore both issues and just settle in to enjoy the humor and romance.
0,Great fiction 'based on fact' story. Good beach read.
0,great
0,This is such a gripping, plot twisting, keep you guessing psychological thriller. This novel keeps you on the edge of your seat. I joined in with Beth on her hunches and rooted her on with every page.
0,*Received an ARC for an honest review*	I love the Devils Knights boys.  I fell in love HARD with Meg and Lo and haven't been the same since.  In Unraveling Fayth, we get to see Meg and Lo, and all the other characters we love so much.  Meg is still up to her shenanigans and Lo is still trying to keep up.  LOL  I love that girl!		So, this book starts a little after the events in the last book.  We pick up with Fayth living with her brother recuperating and Slider at the clubhouse going out of his mind needing to see Fayth.  We know what Sliders damage is, but his is clueless.  Even old Leo can see whats going on, but it takes Slider a little longer.  When these two do finally get together, hold on to your panties, girls!  Its hot and steamy.  Little Fayth is a little wilder than I first imagined her to be!  And its so good!  I loved the interaction between Fayth and Slider because they both wanted each other so much, they literally filled the holes in each others souls.  The girls are the highlight of this book after the hot sex.  I literally want to move to that imaginary town and hang out with these people.  Meg is by far my favorite book friend, shes just magnetic.  I absolutely loved the epilogues at the endwe get to see where each couple is at five years after this story ends.  I have all of Winters books, and I am looking forward to her new series.  Especially with RemyI cant wait to get more Meg and see how Remy is as an adult!		#MakeMeASliderSpecial	#SlideItHome	#MegIsMyGirlCrush	#LoveMeSomeLoDaze	#MarleyCantCook	#SayNoToPotatoSalad
0,Fun book! Out of the ordinary! I really enjoyed it and will get more in this series.
0,Good book. Classic for a reason.
0,Although Coulter can be obnoxious on TV, I enjoyed this book. Unfortunately, the incompetence of the US government is on display and somewhat depressing.
0,Pictures small but nice.
0,I read this book years ago and I continue to reread it yearly. Buy it and enjoy the edification.
0,The author has gotten so much better! His first book was not bad, but it had 'beginner writer' issues and it seemed like he'd written it as a script instead of a book. This book seems to have solved all the technical problems he had in the last book to become really good! He is also able to jump around in time and place and not seem too labored or uncomfortable, better than some I've read!	  You need to read the first book, this book is not a standalone but a continuation of Colby Stephens adventures in the occult otherworlds, I think it might be called Fairy? Anyway, Colby is a highly intelligent young man who seems to get himself into troubles and has to get himself out... some mild surprises and always active and interesting. I found it pretty enjoyable and would recommend it to anyone.
0,Awesome finish to the series. A little slow in the middle, but worth it. I actually liked the dual narrative. It gives you a more complete sense of the world and story. You get to see more of what it going on. Not just what Tris sees. The ending was actually pretty shocking for me. I guess I was kind of expecting a more clich&eacute; happy ending. But I actually prefer a sad or somber ending. It feels more realistic to me. And it was beautifully done in this book.
0,I love this book. It's open, honest and soul bearing. The author doesn't hesitate to question God and what He wants (as the title suggests,) and she's so beautifully vulnerable in being open and loving about it. I recommend this book for anyone who's searching or thinking that they have to tame their own wild heart. She expanded my view of faith and love and I'll never be the same. Amazing book.
0,Title: Blue Hearts of Mars	Author: Nicole Grotepas	Format: ebook 260	Genre: YA Futuristic Fantasy Romance Novel	Cover: Loved it	Characters: Retta & Hemingway	Rating: 4 stars	Series: No	Language:  None	Sex Scenes:  None	Setting: Planet Mars		Story Brief:	Seventeen-year-old Retta Heikkinen is in love with a boy--a thoroughly gorgeous, captivating, and mysterious boy known as Hemingway. The situation is rather ideal: he likes her, she likes him. There's just one little problem.		He's a blue heart, an android.		Being in a relationship is its own complicated mess, but how long can a forbidden love last? Soon Retta discovers a secret that could destroy the uneasy truce between the blue hearts and humans, which makes life under the domes on Mars possible. Would exposing what she knows make things better or worse? And how can she know for certain without exposing the secret.		Opinion/Review:	While reading the story I could not help but compare the struggles that these two characters had to deal with from their society to the struggles that minorities have had and continue to have in todays society.  Because Hemingway was an android he was treated differently, he was considered property, he had no rights, he was abused verbally, mentally and physically, but although he did not like it, its all he has known.  Then Retta comes into his life and turns his world upside down.	Retta is 17 with a good heart; she doesnt understand why Hemingway is treated so differently when he is obviously nicer and better looking than the other hateful human boys her age.  She likes him but this feeling will bring her nothing but hard-ache.  Retta at first seems to be a little clueless, and wimpy.  I didn't enjoy her character in the beginning at all, however, by the end of the story she had turned 18 and her character changes so much that I started enjoying the story and her character more.  She stands up for her teacher but more importantly she stands up for the love she has for Hemingway. No matter what the regular humans and her father said about the relationship, she stepped up and defended their love.	 Retta and Hemingway find some information about the biggest most influential corporation in their district and know they must run for both their sake.  They begin to protest about right and equal treatment for Hemingway and people like him while on the run.  They are chased from city to city with the threat if they are caught their memories will be erased.  But, something happens back at home and they must stop running and return home, the inevitable happens and they find Hemingway.		Recommendation:	I recommend this fast paced action filled YA romance story  If you don't mind pulling out the dictionary for a few words.		Notice:	I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for my honest opinion and review.
0,The artist and writer are conveying a passion that reaches out to the heart of one community that has been and is being persecuted all over the world.
0,Now I feel a bit stupid compared to the previous two reviewers. Reading this book, my impression was that the author spent a great deal of time analyzing the motives of the heroic people whose stories he tells, often "explaining" their actions in one way only to peel off that layer and examine them again in a different and still more thoughtful light. The author refers to and presents effective summaries of a great many scholarly studies... some of which I had indeed heard of before, but mostly not. I guess I'm not well-read enough to tell if the author ever generates any unique insights or not.		If anything, I think I would have been more happy with a larger collection of simple-minded but inspiring stories of moral courage, with less of the probing analysis. Indeed the book is a great deal less than inspiring, in view of the "unhappily ever after" endings to some of the stories. Yet the book as it is, while a bit thin for $25, was very satisfactory to me.		My main complaint about the author's writing style is that there seems to be a tendency to name two people in a paragraph, then then throw in a "he" in such a way that it is fairly difficult to tell which of the two people the word "he" is referring to.
0,bought this copy for my daughter.  she wishes she'd had it years earlier.  loves it.
0,My favorite Steinbeck book. A charming love story, with wonderful insights into human character..
0,I love Danielle Steel! I have been reading her books for years. This book did not disappoint, it was so heartwarmng.
0,Another great installment in this series.  This series is one of my favorite and I was looking forward to getting my hands on this gem.  I liked that we were able to get four different POVs from the characters.  (Rock, Hope, Wrath, and Trinity)  I thought the storyline stayed very true to the characters and the series while also keeping up the interest level.  Despite it being the 5th book in this series about the same two couples, I was still very immersed in this book.  We see some steam from the two pairs that lives up to their previous books.  Some of my favorite parts were watching the club house guys interact with Hope.  Parts were awkward, parts were cuteall of it showed how far the characters have come from book 1.  I also couldn't get enough of other characters who have been on the sidelines but are now getting their own books.  I cant wait for Book 6 to come out so I can see how the Murphy/Heidi/Axel saga plays out.  Im #TeamMurphy but Axel is growing on me.  For now, Im happy with getting to see more of Rock/Hope and Wrath/Trinity and see rereads in my future.		I was provided with an ARC in exchange for my honest review.
0,Another classic that I purchased for my toddler granddaughter; I read all these classics as a kid who devoured books at the local library; so glad to see they are still in print and that I'm able to pass these stories down to future generations!
0,Max Liebermann and Oskar Rheinhardt are 2 men I would like to meet. They are highly educated and classy. They work together on solving the murder of an opera diva. In doing so they see the darker side of politics and life in Vienna.
0,A heavenly book for the holidays of a mathematician who sometime desire to have some light matter to read and yet wants to stay "in mathematics". I learned the subject in an introductory lecture on astronomy, and very much regret that 50 years ago that book did not exist!
0,AAAAWWWEEESSOOOOOMMMMEE! !! To explain it in one word. I received this book from the author in exchange for an honest review. This book was a great read from beginning to end. I was on the road with my husband and he couldn't get two words outta me while I was reading it then when it ended he thought something was wrong with me because I was flipping out saying I gotta get the next book...lol oh how cruel but clever you were michaelbrent for that ending I can definitely tell that was the work of a woman, you cut me deep..lol. Zombie book.. yes it is but with a different twist. it really gets you involved with the characters. This is a must read!!!
0,LOVE all these books. I've read the series and looking for more!
0,I couldn't put this book down.  I just heard of it a few weeks ago.  I don't normally spend 9.99 on a book, but for some reason I knew this one was worth it.  IT WAS!!!! I saw the movie before finishing the book, which was great because I now had the images in my mind of what each character looked like.  This  book has so many thought provoking ideas in it ,I have to read it again.  I have never made so many notes in a book before.  Loved, loved, loved it!!
0,This book had me caught up in the story from page one.  I  could not put this down.  Two souls with individual stories of pasts so horrible that they didn't want to mention any detail that they've had to endure for fear of reliving the hurt and pain. Bad boy Johnny sets his sights on lead singer and guitarist, Bex. Can they find a way to let each other in or will they be forever broken?
0,Omg Omg Omg. I loved this book soooo much I read it in 1 day and plan on buying a print copy. It has everything from love to adventure to sex to suspense. I loved not knowing what was going to happen from 1 minute to the next.

0,It is unfair to compare Jack Du Brul's writing with those of Ian Fleming and Clive Cussler. In reading this novel the author's influences are very clear but he does it with his own sense of style. He is a promising new author who will probably be successful with his projects.	Philip Mercer is a geologist who becomes embroiled in a disaster happening in the Pacific Ocean area. Several ships have disappeared near the island of Hawaii including a NOAA ship where Mercer would have been part of the crew if not for prior commitments. In that ship is Mercer's mentor's daughter Tish Talbot. She is the only survivor of that shipwreck and there are people who want to kill her. Out of a sense of obligation Mercer becomes her bodyguard until he can figure what is going on.	In the island of Hawaii a civil war is beginning to brew. Takahoru Ohnishi is one of the most powerful men in Hawaii. He controls the cops as well as several government officials and is currently bankrolling a coup attempt. Ohnishi is a racist who wants to break out of the United States in order to give Hawaii its own independence and be able to do business with the Japanese. The reality is that all of this is a diversion to what is really happening in the Pacific Ocean. It is a Russian top secret plan that has been set into motion fifty years ago and it is now coming to fruition. If successful it will bring a lot of money and influence to the participants.	The book has a lot of humor and action making it quite entertaining. The supporting characters in this novel are strong and are probably going to return in the near future. If you are looking for a great beach read this is the book for you. It is the start of what appears to be an incredible series.
0,If you like history, drama, and romance, this trilogy is for you. Beautifully written and highly entertaining. You will laugh, cry, and experience every emotion in between.
0,Two of my Favorite Authors brought this book to life. It picked up right where it left off flowed great and brought more drama. Trigga is a BEAST and a smart one at that. Keisha keeps him grounded and soothes the Beast within him. I cannot stand LLOYD he is beyond deranged and I hope he dies a horrible death. As for Mase at first I wanted him dead but I really think he just needs help. He is a follower with no direction. Please please please don't keep me waiting to long for the next installment. I need it ASAP. #TeamKeisha&Trigga
0,Look, you are not reading the memoirs of a world leader or an economic mover and shaker. You are simply reading the exploits of an entertainer that was there at the advent of rock and roll and continues to have a front row seat through the window of the world of rock music.		The writing style is easy to follow and flowing, there is a lot of material on the formation of the band and personality of the members, a definite concentration on what it is like to compose and write the music (I'm a guitarist so I really enjoyed all the musical jargon), there's a bit of tabloid sleaze and, best of all, a fantastic perspective on the songs, albums, tours and other important aspects of the band.		Keith Richards comes across a lot more intelligent, modest and righteous then you would think. My respect for him as a musician has tremendously increased after reading how he approached his craft.		I found this very enjoyable, light reading for any fan of rock music
0,illusion		ilooZHn/		 a thing that is or is likely to be wrongly perceived or interpreted by the senses.		a deceptive appearance or impression.	a false idea or belief		Before I start my review for Illusion by J.S. Cooper, you need to know the meaning of the title. To say it is aptly named is an understatement because the entire time you are reading this book your perception is probably wrong.		Illusion is a mystery/suspense novel. This is not a genre that I am really familiar with. I tend to read only romance, so diving into this book was a new experience for me. I really liked how the entire book I kept thinking that I knew what was happening or was trying to guess what was happening and as much as I think I am a sleuth, J.S. Cooper totally proved me wrong.		Illusion is Biancas story.it is her quest to find the truth about the death of her mother from a bedside confession from her dead father. As she is trying to figure out what really happened, she is kidnapped and stranded on an island with a sexy man named Jakob. As both are thrust into surviving on a desolate island, they are trying to figure out how exactly they connect and why they were both kidnapped.		Through questioning each other, Bianca and Jakob begin to put pieces of this kidnapping together, yet they don't always know when to trust each other. Bianca tends to run her mouth and give away more than she should and Jakob is extremely tight lipped.  Even as clues are found, they still don't want to put all their faith into each other.especially when a newcomer is found on the island.		Jakob and Bianca have chemistry. It is felt pretty immediate. J.S. Cooper can write some steamy, steamy beach scenes. I loved how even with everything going on they had a natural attraction to each otherbut will it last when more secrets are revealed?		Illusion sucks you in from the beginning. I was dying to know all along what the tie is between these two and I too wanted the answers to the questions that were plaguing Bianca. I really loved Jakobs character.he was most definitely swoonworthy and Bianca, who is a movie critic, gave some awesome movie snippets that I truly enjoyed. There is a bit of repetition in the book with Biancas thoughts that I would have liked to seen edited out, but Illusion definitely captured my attention and with the cliffhanger, I am eagerly looking forward to book two. I hope you enjoy being on the island as much as I did!
0,Excellent read, very fast moving easy to follow
0,Interesting Information on Philip Marlowe Author, Raymond Chandler and his wife.		This is an interesting work following in the footsteps of the many places in and around Los Angeles that author Raymond Chandler and his wife lived in.  Some photographs and a good perspective.
0,A page turner - I bought another Leslie Wolfe book to read!!
0,Wow, this is a brutal story. The violence is beyond anything I've ever read before, but hell, that is some great writing.
0,Arrived in good shape.
0,I did receive an advance copy for an honest review, but it's so good, and at a great price right now, that I bought a copy today.  Each story left me wanting more, in a good way!  Some of my favorite authors are included in this anthology.  Each story is a whole world: thrilling, heartbreaking, thought provoking.  So many twists I had to read several stories twice!  I heartily recommend this book.
0,I wish more military romances had a kick butt heroine!!! Loved all the characters, the storyline and the writing style.  One of the best military romances I have ever read.
0,A really great romantic thriller.  I have the next book in this series and I am really excited and looking forward to reading this next book in this series.  KATHY
0,i haven't started reading it yet. but it arrived as expected.
0,I was looking for an explanation of these concepts in the words of the men themselves.  Faraday's work was explained the best.  Maybe that was because he was a hands on experimenter.  I was dificult to get a grasp on what exactly Maxwell did, especially as he built on Faraday's works.  I did add a few tidbits of ideas to my collection that I am building while trying to understand physics and the quantum.  The subjext is still elusive.
0,What a great book.  I work in an assistive living center.  I used this book for a large group discussion.  We had so much fun looking back on the old shows.  The photos are the perfect size for everyone to see.  The price was amazing.
0,Very good.  Enjoyed
0,My grandmother was a fan of this book and I bought her a copy for $100 back when they were extremely hard to find, as it was out of print. After she passed away, I borrowed it and read it, and was thoroughly entertained. Very good storytelling, and very good ideas. I won't rave about it as others have here (come on people...), but it was a very forward-thinking book. WHY are people making movies like The Day After Tomorrow when a film of the HAB Theory is waiting to be made? I see that movie rights have been sold (see a letter from the author at [...]) but where is the movie?
0,I can't emphasize how much I enjoyed this book. I have always loved behind the camera stories about the entertainment business and I also love true life stories about people beating deadly illnesses and this book had both. I had not heard that Bochco had leukemia so that was definitely an interesting sub plot and he held nothing back about what he went through with the treatment. Obviously it's not fun to get your white blood cell count down to zero and spend 70 days in the hospital. Also lots of interesting stories - good and bad - about the people he dealt with making lots of TV shows. I'm glad he laid it out there about his sister's ingratitude in refusing to be a donor for his much needed bone marrow transplant. There is a great epilogue about the sweet young man who was the donor.		Of course the best gossipy anecdote  was what a nutcase David Caruso was - I had heard snippets of his psycho behavior before so this kind of filled that in. He was very careful not to hurt the feelings of past loved ones, for example he trod lightly over his divorce from Barbara Bosson stressing it was really no one's fault - just one of those things and they are still friends. Probably a lot more to that story but kindly did not expand on it. All in all a great book and I am so happy for him that he survived the illness and I hope it won't be his last book because he's a heck of a writer. I loved this book and highly recommend it.
0,I believe this will make for interesting reading, but surely there could have been drawings, maps or photos to help a reader get a clearer view of what they are reading about.  For this reason I am giving a 4 rating.		I only received this today.
0,short novella -- read in one night with easse
0,Emotional. Disturbing.  Amazingly well,written.  Should be required reading.  You see things differently after reading this book.  More dedicated to making sure we don't let this happen in Historynagain. Which we are already failing to do I fear
0,I am a 29 year old male who never struggled with weight before until about a year ago.  I was the skinny guy in high school and could eat whatever I wanted.  Well that all changed and I ballooned to 198 pounds.  I'm 5'11 and while definitely not too overweight, I felt slow and uncomfortable.	The first few days were tough.  I was constantly craving food (carbs), but I resisted.  My daily routine involved getting up and drinking the cranwater (which is actually pretty good), the hot lemon water and a strawberry smoothie with Whey protein powder.  My morning snack was raw green beans.  Lunch are eggs and carrots and I would have salad and meat at night.  It was hard to adjust to not eating all the time, but it is well worth it.	After 1 week, I had lost 8 pounds.  Seeing the daily loss in weight was great.  After two weeks, I had lost 13 pounds.  After three weeks, I lost a total of 14.5 pounds.  I am losing less and less, but I am fitting into clothes I haven't worn in a couple years.  I feel great and I am eating food I like.  I sometimes miss the carbs, but I would never go back to where I was.	This program is definitely life changing.  I have a great morning routine and now schedule out when and what I eat.  I also find it important to plan ahead and have food ready to go for the week.  It cuts down on time and allows the week to be easy.	Finally, if you are skeptical, I was too.  I would have never tried the plan if my coworker hadn't been so successful doing it.  If you stick to the plan, you will succeed.  There are two things I haven't followed: taking all the vitamins and avoiding coffee.  The plan can be expensive, so I don't buy the extras.  I also love my morning cup of coffee.  I now drink it black and enjoy it.  You can do it!  Buy the book for $4 used and you won't regret it!
0,Just loved it. Very interesting in the details and plot.
0,Just finished this book. I like Dan Harris and enjoyed what all he had to say!  He made a lot of great points regarding meditation. I loved his style, sense of humor, and it was thought provoking. I enjoyed him on ABC before, but now it feels like watching an old friend. I feel like I know him so much better. He was candid about his business and relationships. I thought he was very real. I have suggested it to a number of friends. I will read anything else he writes and hope he has a long career on ABC. I've been meditating more and about to start yoga. I felt encouraged by him. Thanks, Dan for your great delivery on giving us our news -and now for this great book. You never know I might check out one of those retreats.
0,I could not put this book down. I found it so intriguing and Anita Moorjani's writing and telling of her story is so genuine and honest and I truly believe every word she stated about her near death experience. I've read other books on this subject but they just didn't hold my interest the way Anita's story did. I liked the background info she presented about the two different cultures her parents came from and what was expected of her as a woman in the indian culture which went against her personal beliefs. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to believe in something that comes after death.
0,Well-written story of the horrors of war as experienced by barely-trained military nurses.  Satisfying ending for these 3 women. Now if we could only put an end to war as well.
0,The first book I've read by this author. It was a refreshing treatment of this genre and I enjoyed it immensely.  The characters were interesting and the uneasy tangle of magical between them was great. Can't wait to read more of her work.
0,Thirty years ago two sisters suddenly disappear from a Baltimore mall.  After being in a hit and run accident a young woman claims to be one of the kidnapped sisters.  Could that be true?		This is a tightly drawn psychological character driven drama told from multiple viewpoints.  Not your usual fast paced plot driven suspense, it none the less piqued my interest throughout a very engaging read.  The characters were well developed especially the mother, Miriam.  The novel clipped along at a good pace with several twists and turns.		After reading Laura Lippman's newest novel,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/I-d-Know-You-Anywhere-A-Novel/dp/0061706558/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">I'd Know You Anywhere: A Novel</a>, I became a fan.  When you love to read it is really wonderful to discover an author who has published other works to be enjoyed.  She will definitely be on my list of future purchases.		Enjoy the read!
0,Loved this book from the begining. If series reading the continuation.
0,Great story kids love it
0,I really enjoyed this novella, so much so that I wish it was a complete novel.
0,This book was very well written.  There were a few things that I had forgotten but when I read them It all came back to me.  I lived through those horrible days and you don't forget the main things that you saw,  There  have been many books written with many ideas about who was involved in the assassination. this book will discuss some of the theories, and the people involved.  Read the book to understand what I am talking abput.
0,This book was sent to me as a gift, but the gift slip was crumpled deep inside the package and I didn't see it until later when I dug it out.  I had not ordered the book and set it down for a couple of days, then found out from Amazon who had sent it to me.  Only then did I open it.  The book probably is one of the best books I ever received as a gift.  The depths of understanding of its subject matter are virtually unfathomable.  I recommend it highly.
0,When you see how today's authors are contracted to write a series of books involving a specific character or setting, you can't help wonder what might have been in regards to Nifft and Michael Shea.		Shea's style is as close as you will get to Robert E. Howard as Howard himself.  Nifft the Lean hints at past adventures by Nifft himself that undoubtedly could have been the basis for several books.		Wonderful book that will leave you with a bittersweet feeling in how much you enjoyed the book but wishing there had been many more novels about Nifft and the world he lived in other than the two that were written.		I would definitely recommend Nifft to anybody, regardless of whether you are a fan of the genre or not just because of the excellent writing.  And don't stop there if you have never read Robert E. Howard either.  If you liked Nifft then you will definitely enjoy the works of Robert E. Howard, the father of the genre.
0,I don't read Preston, or his colleague Lincoln Child, thinking that I'm going to read a completely plausible tale. I've been a loyal reader of their co-authored and solo projects for over 2 years, and the combination of science fiction and mystery makes me feel like I'm not reading trash. Hey, there's science stuff in here! I'm learning!		Tyrannosaur Canyon weaves scenic description, thoughtful and unforced character development, and a cheetah-paced plot to deliver an enjoyable story. The characterization of the villains shaped the read, contrasting well with truly likeable protagonists. This isn't a tale exploring ethics or morals. It's not supposed to be.		I appreciate Preston (and Child's) ability to create strong female characters, and Preston succeeds with both of the prominent women in this book.		I definitely suggest reading "The Codex" prior to picking this book up. While there aren't too many spoilers (again, a gift of the author; his books follow characters while still existing as stand-alone reads), you will want to read it before devouring Tyrannosaur Canyon.
0,A. Lee Martinez's new novel, Chasing the Moon (May 2011), is reminiscent of the humor of Jasper Fforde and the otherworldliness of Clifford Pickover.  Martinez writes in the genre typical of H. P. Lovecraft's weird fiction.  In Chasing the Moon, heroine Diana finds herself chained to an apartment in an unstable, unpredictable world with three monsters:  Vom the Hungering, who eats everything including packaging and the occasional end table, Smorgaz, who spawns uncontrollably, and Zap, the one-eyed destroyer. Diana's neighbors deal with their own monsters while being overseen by the mind-reading landlord, West.  Chuck, the romantic interest, is kept prisoner by a vicious dog that West warns should never, ever be fed.		Diana tries to navigate this new universe, a rip in the fabric of reality, where menacing voices spoil movie endings and where at any time she could be sucked into an alternative universe where she commits genocide against gnat-sized, flying humans or finds herself prey to jet-sized mosquitoes.  Species vacillate between those who devour and those who are devoured.  Martinez's world is a literal dog-eat-dog environment, or as one character explains, "It's like high school, except instead of jocks versus nerds, it's things who eat civilizations versus things who eat galaxies" (97).  As Diana and her compadres learn to use their magical powers to control the universe, a bigger problem is brewing as the planets align--Sharon and Calvin are dealing with Fenris, the enmity who chases the moon in order to eat it and destroy the universe.		Martinez is king of the similes; gems such as, "It was like reaching underneath all that to get to the core programming at the heart of the video game that was the universe, and using a cheat code to alter an inalterable law" (109) populate the manuscript.  His imagination bleeds into the characters.  At one point Diana complains about her plight to West, "If life worked like that I'd have gotten a winged unicorn when I was six, and I'd be an astronaut who hunts vampires in her spare time" (146).		But Martinez's horrific cosmos is not as despondent as it sounds.  The characters exude a hopefulness that penetrates the book, leading the reader to remember why it is we  get up and toil at our daily jobs even though we know we are doomed to eventually die.
0,Beautiful illustrations, well written like the other octonauts books. My kids LOVED the glow in the dark part. Even though it wasn't a hardback book, still fairly sturdy.
0,Xandra lives with her, uh, ghost parents, her aunt and her little brother in a secluded place in the mountains.  She rarely sees other people and rarely goes down to the city.  But then a walk in the woods shows footprints in the snow and her parents freak.  Apparently, her mom had been keeping a rather large secret from Xandra.  Namely, that she's half-fairy half-witch and that some major people want her dead.		The premise was pretty awesome, but I found it took a while for the book to gain speed.  This is not unique in the first novel of a series where there is a lot of set up for the following books.  But Lamer manages to get the story going when the relationship between Xandra and the fairy Kallen takes over.  It's a love/hate thing that keeps the reader on her toes.		FYI: Young adult novels where the main love interest is insulting and manipulative are often on my black list.  And the prevalence in which this sort of relationship occurs in these books (and how popular they are) turns my stomach.  I feel girls have enough self-esteem issues nowadays, that they don't need that kind of relationship to seem like something good.  And Kallen was insulting and manipulative.  There's even an undercurrent of violence in some of his attempts to kiss Xandra that grates on me (see my post is what we're reading hurting women)...		And yet...		And yet Lamer kept me reading.  She ramped up the romantic tension to such a high, she got me to like Kallen enough that I was sitting there going, "Come on! Kiss her!" despite my regular standpoints and beliefs.  In short, she got me turning pages, wanting more.		There are some things I question -- the mother's motivation for many things, Xandra's attitude at times.  But overall, I found this book a fun read.  It's FREE on Amazon so I suggest you grab it and decide for yourself.  If you do like it, it's the first in a series, so you'll have more to look forward to.
0,My former retired high school English teacher recommended this book to me via Facebook.  I wondered why on his status he called himself "apolitical."  He suggested reading this book and finding out.  I am almost to page 300 and love it.  Our history books left a lot out, and now I know more of the truth!
0,Lex a girl trying to be herself with out anyone knowing she is a kid to a famous couple. For her 18th birthday the next day she plans on looking her v to her boyfriend but the Cray Cray happens and the whole day is full ride all over the place. Great read. Fast and funny. Loved it.
0,Rachel Friedman's The Good Girl's Guide to Getting Lost is a Jewish journey, a personal narrative of facing fears, transforming internal ideas and metamorphosing into an adulthood grounded in the art of wanderlust. Getting Lost is part travelogue and part personal transformation. This memoir combines the author's personal journey and travel discoveries woven into her stories, along with her reflections about success, failure, life and the meaning of the aforementioned.		Most people do not ever realize before traveling that is, that looking at a map of a foreign country in a language you don't understand will lead you eventually back to yourself. As Ms. Friedman says in her book, "After all these travels, I find I no longer have that fear. Life feels full of opportunity and possibility--and maybe even adventure."		When I travel, I too find that the journeys to the far reaches of the world lead me back to myself - but a new, more insightful self.
0,I love this book! The story was exciting and very well written.
0,Great story
0,Paperback...quickly ripped.
0,Great mystery. The Kate Redman series reminds me some of JD Robb's In Death series, but not as dark. They are well written, good interaction between the characters and interesting plot lines. Highly recommend.
0,This book was so amazing, awesome, fantastic, splendid, great, marvelous  you get where Im going with this Im sure! After reading Strength I automatically purchased Courage and started reading. It isn't rare for me to read a series in two days, but it is rare for me to start all over again practically as soon as I finish. And I did!	I loved seeing Rena and Wallaces relationship evolve. Seeing him meet her family and how he interacted with her friends was great. Usually I have a hard time with second books because of the new trend of keeping the beloved main characters away from each other. While that kinda happens a little bit in this book I totally get the reasoning for it and I believe it actually made the main characters stronger. I really loved how the book ended and cant wait to find out what happens next!
0,A light mystery filled with surprises all thru the book, good book & it also has tossing dogs info you may not know
0,Packed well, shipped quickly, great price!! A+++++!!!!
0,This was a great book so amazing. Never read a better book I love this book. Theese booksare my favorite series
0,I bought this book for my grandson (now nine years old) as an introduction to the theme of individualism vs. collectivism.  It was originally written as a novelette and shouldn't tax the patience of a young person who is becoming aware of life's values and principles for living.		The setting is the future where there is no personal pronoun "I"; everyone thinks in terms of the collective, using the word "we," following the dictates of strict laws and council edicts, and so the world has reverted to a primitive, tribal existence.		One man dares to think for himself, discovers relics of a technological past, and re-invents the light bulb.  Thinking to benefit his brothers, he is denounced and flees to the wilderness.		The hero is an inspiring example for young minds and demonstrates the importance of the individual in human life.
0,It was a little slow in some areas. But it was a good read.  Love lilly harper. Cant wait	for more.
1,Whether any or most of the blame can be laid at the feet of the translator Heaven only knows but this has to be one of the most irritating books I've ever read.  It's liberally sprinkled with clichd Hollywood terms, like referring to the police as `flics', not to mention clichd characters with clichd attitudes: when Vargas does try to invest a character with a degree of originality she renders them unconvincingly: the, naturally intelligent and astonishingly beautiful, female love interest, a composer of soap opera theme tunes who earns her real living as a plumber and spends much of her spare time `reading' plumbing supply catalogues, idolizes her ex-lover, the naturally charismatic, enigmatic but sensitive `hero' cop but then shacks up with a big, boring, brain-dead and bear loving lumberjack type who duly lumbers his way through the action, such as it is, p*ssing off other characters and the reader alike.  The `hero' doesn't begin to make a real contribution to the action until about a third of the way through: from that point on it does become moderately more interesting but by then the only incentive for staying with it is to hope that the wolf has got enough about him to rip through his motley pursuers and put everyone out of their misery.
1,I was surprised that I didn't like this book, because I read and like lots of classical American literature (Steinbeck, Twain, Hawthorne, Williams, Stegner, Mailer, Hemmingway, Wright). The characters just seemed boring and instantly forgettable. I feel that what is lacking is the feeling of America: big and diverse and full of surprises. These people feel small and trite - can anyone get excited about a drawer full of shirts?
1,I don't know why I keep giving these NA sports books a chance. I HAAAATTEE when the heroine goes gaga over the jerk hero immediately, JUST because he is attractive. Sure enough, 10% into this one, the heroine is having fantasies, despite being warned about the hero and swearing up and down that she wouldn't be like all the other girls.
1,I felt this book was all over the place and tough to follow.  Only two characters have real depth and one of them is killed off.  I have to care about the characters in order to enjoy the story.  No character here grabs me.  The crew travels from location to location without having the time to learn or explore where the happen to end up.  There is an underlying discussion about the relationship between science and faith.  There is some food for thought in this discussion.  There is not enough here for me to want to read the next book in the series.
1,In a world where folk are either common or noble, Temric FitzHenry, bastard of Graistan, is neither and both. Only too late does he meet his equal, Philippa of Lindurst, also a bastard raised to noble expectations; Philippa is already married. When Temric discovers the abuse Philippa endures, his heart demands that he steal her from her husband. As he does so, he promises that she'll never know pain with him.		Philippa cherishes each day she spends with the him, knowing her husband will someday find them and they will die. If Temric is ever to be truly hers, Philippa must find the courage to defy death and escape a heritage that makes her love of Temric the deepest of sins.		Set in the late twelfth century, Summer's Storm takes place in the time of King Richard the Lionheart and Robin Hood.		As I have said before when I start a book, particularly an historical, I consider all books to have 5 stars until I find something to jolt me out of it.		One of the things that jolted me out of the story was the phrase "By Christ's holy cock."  I had run into this phrase in the 1st book of the series, Winter's Heat, and deducted a star because no matter how less squeamish they were in 1194 about body parts and functions, this phrase is not IMO suitable for a modern audience.  It it too jarring and ripped me right out of the story.  It was too much authorial intrusion for me.		I hate stereotyped cliched characters and this book had 2 of them: Margaret and the slutty money grabbing bitch from Winter's Heat, whose name I can't remember. Roger the bully was also a stereotype.		Then there was the character of Phillipa.. She was portrayed one way in Winter's Heat and entirely differently in Summer's Storm.  I felt the author's attempts to reconcile the 2 different versions were unconvincing.		Something I just could not swallow was Phillipa and Temric acting on their sexual desires for each other despite the laws of consanguinity.  In medieval eyes it would have been considered an extreme for of sexual perversion and there is no way any person or priest would ever have condoned it.  Yes, to our modern eyes, there would be no reason for these 2 not to get it on.  But in medieval law, it was impossible.  So there went another star.
1,I bought this book because I thought it would help me visualize (in some way) the 4th dimension. But, although the author does indeed try to do so in the first three chapters, he then starts going on about quantum mecanics (briefly), special relativity and general relativity in the "traditional" way: with Minkowsky diagrams (1 space dimension and 1 time dimension), so I guess the 4th dimension simply is forgotten after the three first chapters.		If you are looking for books on quantum mechanics, special relativity and/or general relativity, there are much better books than this. If you are looking (as I was) for a book on geometry and the 4th dimension, than the first three chapters of this book are not bad, but are not enough...
1,Allan Ginsberg wrote in August 1972: "Some of Kerouac's writings of '52, particularly his Visions of Cody, are some of the most brilliant texts written about the psychedelic experience, especially the description of him and Neal Cassidy on Peyote." AND From October 26, 1974, Ginsberg writes of himself, which he learned from Kerouac: What I mean by "polish the mind," in that you actually do get an increasing awareness either through meditative or poetry which is another yoga, of the actual stuff, cita. And then it becomes a matter of being a very faithful secretary. You can't get everything, so you get as much as you can so you have something solid to work with. In other words, you're not doing something arbitrary, romantic, babble, bullsh*t, you're actually dealing with your mind stuff just like a painter's working with an actual landscape. Solid in the sense that it's real, it's objective, it isn't even your subjectivity any more, you're just objectively watching something move. So there's no long any question of egotism or self-expression or personal expression. All those theoretical things are like nonpracticing questions. But if you're actually practicing there's a real thing to work with, which is your thought-forms."		"Chogyam Trungpa's principle of "First thought, best thought." That was kerouac's basic principle for his spontaneous writing, for the same Buddhist reasons of practical inquiry into the operation of the mind. Both Kerouac and Trungpa realized, and teach, a very simple thing, which is that the first way that you flash on a thing is the unselfconscious, naked, real first-mind way, which is totally private and odd, eccentric to you, but is so direct that anybody can understand it."		At first, this book was way too muddled to be of much use for myself, not receiving much out of the book and feeling that I have invested way too much time for the read, but I think that's because I've been reading it as a novel like "On The Road," and this is more poetry or jazz style spontaneous prose. Actually, this book is from flashing mental thoughts that are suddenly inspired within the self. This book is not some preplanned novel and storyline and not at all the robotic, mechanical mindset of the propogandized America and therefore represents a breakthrough in American thinking, thinking for the autonomous self.		I think if this book were given the publisher to publish before "On The Road" they would have agreed here on such being garbled and overly Proustian in attempt of remembrance. However, to the person looking for poetry or verbal prose over a story, and in this we have a jazz type expression of bebop in words and that makes this book a major change from the herd mentality of the masses. Hey, this is the beat rhythmic language, not Melville or Dostoevsky, but Proust and Celine.		Now to be fair, there are some good descriptions and well written feelings through out the book, but not in volume. Now don't get me wrong, I'm a Beat Hipster I would like to think, a Nietzschian, a mystical, philosophical seeker into spiritual, psychedelic and karmic realms, but maybe not the existential, Benzedine type. This book is largely garbled ramblings?? Or is just too poetic for me? I can appreciate the long "bird" Parker-like jazz of the spontaneous sentence styles, the overly descriptive emphasis on observable flashes of insight, but this story has no story line, ok-it's poetry or electic prose. So it's verbal dynamics in avant garde, not a novel then, and I guess I'm failing to fully appreciate it.		When Kerouac gets Celine-ian he works very well, but when he enters his Proustian attempt at daily observations, he becomes cloudy in tangent ramblings of private memories, non-relating to his current observations that are over detailed and nonsensical in the first place. His dope-riddled conversations and past remembrances enter back doorways in winding pathways of the red neon lights.		Now Ginsberg's introduction to the book, that I found both enjoyable and very understandable. Allen Ginsberg in a November 26th 1968 interview, from the book, Spontaneous Mind, page 132, writes on Robert Creeley and Kerouac's style of writing:		"Creeley was talking about how his writing was determined by the typewriter, neurasthenias of his habit; mine is determined by the physical circumstances of writing, i.e., literally that. And I got that actually from Kerouac, who was that simple and straight about it. If he had a short notebook he wrote little ditties and if he had a long . . . a big typewriter page, he wrote big long sentences like Proust."		I think this agrees with Visions of Cody, in consisting of either short "ditties" or "long sentences like Proust," all depending on the writing pad Kerouac was using at the time of writing. To me this makes a whole lot of sense in the arbitrary, elusive and haphazard style of this book.		What appears to me as the Kerouac trademark: a jazz styled prose of spontaneous expression from the "real," non-conditioned, non-image-to-portray self, an existential life of despair in fast paced living with the rush of jazz, drink, sex, travel, under the literary and scholarly ideals of avant garde sophistication, adventure, desires, seeking new discoveries, walking places one never has been before, risk taking and traveling, all so under this empty void of utter lonely existence, devoid of substantial meanings of foundational holds and securities, walking in the desert not knowing when water will appear and if it does, if this water will sustain life or poison it. So there's this emptiness, this sadness of it all in the modern man and woman, both subterranean and beatnik.		Remember-able observances in my mind: Kerouac's staring up at a man in an apartment building watching and writing and suddenly the light goes off! He saw him!; a description of a church that failed all gothic tests into the modern brown brick suburban model of tackiness with the stupidest shrubbery to boot; Cody's (Cassidy's) hobo father walking the train tracks looking for a fix; Cody's pool hustling and challenged football playing from a jump out of the car, left on the side of the road.
1,When I heard that a book was being released detailing what happened in the Buffyverse after the Sunnydale Hellmouth's closing, I was very excited.  The only hints as to what happened to Buffy and gang were a few vague hints during season five of 'Angel'.  I figured it would be nice to know what happened to the crew.  I wish I hadn't found out.		Nancy Holder, by far the worst of the usual Buffy book writers, slings out the horrible 'Queen Of Slayers'.  The plotline involves Buffy and the gang going to Europe to organize all the newly activated Potentials, Giles helping re-establish the Watchers Council, and what the crew was going to do regarding the infamous Hellmouth in Cleveland.  Yeah, sounds good doesn't it?  Well, its not.  The three little plotlines I mentioned are made immensely boring by Holder.		When it comes to Buffy books, there's one major thing I look for:  do the characters feel like they do on the show?  None of them do in this awful attempt.  They don't act like themselves and most border on irritating.  Not to mention the absolutely horrible storyline involving Buffy and the Immortal.  And then when Holder starts throwing in guest appearances by just about every person that was ever on the television show, it just gets laughable.  Not to mention the extremely childish nature with which the book is written (Holder using verbs like "fwopping"...ugh).  And the most interesting storylines, those being the re-establishment of the Council and Faith fighting the Cleveland Hellmouth, are more-or-less glossed over for a plot involving Buffy, the Immortal, and mystical cellphones...seriously.		But by far the worst thing in the book (along with the many typographical errors) is the ending.  It is absolutely ridiculous.  There's a big apocaplyptic battle, which in theory sounds interesting (I won't give it away if you actually intend on reading this piece of garbage).  But it ends up, like every thing else in this book, turning out in a way that makes you want to vomit.  I couldn't believe what had Ms. Holder had written over the last twenty pages or so.  I was laughing all through it because it was so terrible.  Wait until you read about the banner with Buffy's name on it...just awful.		I know that Buffy's creator, Joss Whedon, has to approve everything (books, comics, etc.) by other authors regarding the Buffyverse.  I just can't see how he could've let this stinker get through.  This is an awful book.  There are so many different plots (including one involving some shapeshifters that goes nowhere, one about Xander going to Africa, and then Holder throws in one about Dawn being put into a mystical coma) and none of them go anywhere.  Its really quite sad that the first book post-Sunnydale had to be this junker.  'Queen Of Slayers' is easily the worst Buffy book ever and one of the worst novels overall I've ever read.		Please do youself a favor and skip this one.  It really is that awful.  I cringe thinking about the ridiculous nature of the book.  Terrible.
1,Blame it on fan fiction.		I started reading fan fiction, then writing it.  I stuck to moderated sites because mistakes in spelling, grammar and punctuation (aka SPaG) tossed me out of the story.  Eventually I became a moderator for my favorite site, enforcing the same rules that I tried hard to keep.  It makes sense to want your story, even if it's only fan fiction, to be the best it can be.  Because I use voice activated software to write, I used two beta readers to make sure my stories had no errors in SPaG, then I had a plot beta reader who made sure my story had no glaring mistakes in continuity or plot.  I give my background so you know where I'm coming from.		The blurb caught me immediately.  A ghostly love story?  New Orleans - one of my favorite cities?  A witch?  Count me in!  Then I started reading and realized that Kara Kirkendoll did not have any kind of proofreader.  Punctuation was hit or miss, mostly miss, especially with dialogue. Other errors knocked me out of the story.  A minor one was with the balcony.  Drew left the sliding door open.  The problem is that her apartment is supposed be in the historic French Quarter.  Sliding doors would not be allowed in that part of town.  A larger plot hole is the fact she and a friend, while drunk, mooned a group of little old ladies and knocked a shot glass down from her balcony onto them.  She has an eviction notice on her door the next morning, giving her five days to leave... and this is on a Sunday.  I've had to evict people before, and I know this is improbable.  True, I am not a resident of Louisiana, but I doubt if the laws concerning eviction vary that much.		I hate reviewing a book I haven't read, but with all of the problems in the opening chapter, I couldn't continue.  There was also a spacing problem between paragraphs, sometimes there was no line between paragraphs, making it difficult to decipher. It also hurts me to give a one star review to a book others so clearly love.  I found Drew to be very immature, but that could have changed later on in the book.		I am well aware that by leaving a poor review opens me up to criticism, but I have two hopes in doing so.  First, I really hope Ms. Kirkendoll reads this and ignores her squeeing fans who tell her that her story is absolute perfection just as it is and gets a beta reader and corrects her story and uploads it again so I can read the book and give it a great review.  I hope if she doesn't, then other readers who like to have a good story with spelling, punctuation and grammar correct and no plot holes will know that they may not enjoy this story as much as one where the writer goes the extra step by having checked for problems.
1,First time reader of LJ Ross. Well written and good pacing. Just don't like books that end with cliffhangers.
1,Let's forget the writing for a minute as the stories are good as expected. The problem here is that in order to read the one story a loyal fan doesn't already own means that you're forced to buy the rest. Does it work? I bought it so it obviously does but it's at the cost of his respect. I'm bitterly disappointed.
1,Written in the '60's, this book (and the series that follows it) explores a classic battle between Light and Dark; in Over Sea, Under Stone three children on vacation in Cornwall discover a set of clues that may lead them to recovery of a Grail linked to King Arthur.  This book is the least original of the series-- it feels a lot like The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe-- but all of the books suffer from the same problem: the female characters are so out-of-date.  Throughout the book, Jane, the middle child, acts like a cross between nagging sister and nagging mom; she is easily scared, she always has a reason not to try to find the Grail, she's the one who's fooled into giving away some secrets, and when the boys go in to explore the frightening cave "poor Jane" (as Cooper calls her) stays outside, standing guard (and screws that up too).  Even reading these books in the early 80s as a kid I found the women unlikeable and identified with the boys instead, but at this point Young Adult fantasy has moved so far past that-- with tough, smart girls in works by authors like Tamora Pierce and Diane Duane-- that you have to wonder what the point is of resurrecting these books now-- except for the tie-in with the movie.  (This applies to the other books in the series as well; in The Dark Is Rising, Will's sisters are clothes- and boy-obsessed, whiny, and the character who goes to the Dark Side is a weak-willed, vain woman... *yawn*.)  With so much good work being written now, why would anyone want their little girls (or little boys) reading this-- and, will children want to read it?
1,Reality wasn't to impress.
1,I'm giving this book only two stars because I feel this book is a rip-off of Diana Gabaldon's of the Outlander books. The writing is more superficial. There is not nearly the level of interesting detail Diane Gabaldon provides.	If I weren't already a fan Gabaldon, I might have given Ms. Longley a higher rating.
1,Didn't find this at all helpful.  Very little actual information.  Sections such as HELP FOR RIDING...I could have written and given more/better information.
1,Lame a** book. Would be sooo much better if it was the point of view of a grown person. not some dumb teenager	Ugh, couldn't even get halfway thru this book. Returning it as i type this.
1,As a reader, I was neither engaged nor excited.  The author painted with such large brush strokes that i never felt brugh in to the story.  Characters were one dimensional...plastic, if you will.  Very disappointing novel.
1,I chose this book because on of the Amazon editors labeled it as a "very funny novel." Not only is it not funny, I found it horrifying that this woman would let things get so bad for her children before doing something about her situation.
1,Sorry, didn't like the book
1,Elizabeth Kostova continues to seduce and frustrate me.	I am one of her readers that gets sucked into a near hypnotic state reading her meandering yet most of time delightfully descriptive prose and since I am fascinated with Eastern European history I continue to fall for her plot lines. However Like the Historian I found myself being dragged down endless trails, some have a point and many do not, meanwhile I cling to the sensation that everything is building up to a tremendous and unexpected ending that will blow my mind. Nope.		Just as I felt at the end of the Historian I found myself staring blankly at the final page thinking: "Is this it? Really?" I almost want to shake the book to see if I can knock a better ending out of it and it drives me nuts! Kostova has an almost magical sense of prose writing that is almost poetic but has no imagination for story telling and I keep wondering how that can possibly be so? My current level of frustration tells me that this is an author I must for my own sake give up hope for and abandon.
1,Recently John Oliver gave a much-needed expose on the less-than-legitimate ways in which "science" is communicated to the public at large; questionable claims backed by questionable, or just mis-interpreted, studies endlessly promoted by the mass media just to garner controversy and ratings.	This mess of a book is full of such junk science. To wit: "They (fruits) even possess a form of intelligence: bananas and oranges connected to lie-detecting polygraphs have been shown to respond to mathematics questions in experiments..."	And where is the source of this claim? There is no Notes Section in this book. There is a "Further Reading" section, though that won't help provide the reader with properly tracking down any of the statements put forth.	Mr. Gollner has also too much of an adolescent infatuation with ideas of sex; his chapters are chock full of all the metaphors, myths and whatnot concerning human beings and their historical and current attaching of libidinal connotations with various fruits... to the point where he feels it necessary to quote some loser friend of his who admits, "When I open a fig... I want to "expletive" it." Whether such associations are valid or not, the author's non-stop accounts of such just get to be annoying.	Don't even waste your time, let alone money, with this ridiculous tome.
1,Not impressed by this book. Organization seems rambling. Author focuses on specific examples rather than any broad scientific basis. Definitely not as intriguing as similar books.
1,This translation was hard to read and the added words sometimes changed the meaning that is intended. I prefer a word for word translation.
1,I don't know where this author got her information but, we have a large population of Amish in our area. One, they most certainly DO go to doctors  I've worked in the medical field and we had many Amish patients). They don't have health insurance so they pay for their treatment at the time of service. Also, one does not become an RN in two years. You CAN take an LPN course but it is a difficult course and you need money to take it. To become an RN is hard work. Check your facts!
1,Ehhhh... at first I was invested in Jewell's portion of the story. I was even a bit intrigued by what happened to Blake's parents. And then..... the actual story happened.		I finished this story because I kept hoping things would be different. Yet somehow it just managed to get worse. Jewell tells Blake the truth - he accuses her of lying and is a jerk to her. Jewell does everything she is told to do - Blake is still a jerk to her. Aside from Jewell wanting to save her brother there was nothing even remotely redeeming about this story. It was abusive, and it was degrading. Yes Blake "paid" for her, but then he started having feelings for her and when that happened I was hoping for a "connection" between them. Nope.		Overall - This is part one of series and does end of a cliff-hanger. I however, will not be continuing on with this series.
1,Book was in terrible condition
1,This review is not about the stories themselves -- it's about this particular edition. Typos abound, whoever put it together forgot to include a table of contents, and its interior was clearly laid out by someone using a program like MS Word instead of an actual design program. Utterly amateur -- the stories deserve better.
1,I found this book boring and tiresome. Halfway through I knew how it would end. I don't know why I kept reading it.
1,I read a lot and I was disappointed that the twists and turns in this plot just got more and more mentally disturbed rather than finding any solutions or rational conclusions.  Would not recommend it.
1,Maybe I should have tried harder.  But I just could not pick up the threads of the plot.  Right from the get go this novel is  tedious,  Doer can't be straightforward.  He keeps shifting  back and forth in time confusing the reader.  And he uses five words when one will do. It's not "cold", it's  frigid, frosty, icy,  blizzard-like and on and on it goes.  At first I started skipping paragraphs, then pages and finally chapters.  The ending was flat.  I know I'm in the minority but there are far more exciting and historic novels  about World War II than this book about a blind French girl and young German boy who are never fully developed.
1,the cover is not the same that appears in the picture and is very damaged and painted with a pen
1,Fritz breaks the most elementary rules of scholarly writing by quoting the same references several times in a row. It wouldn't be so bad, if he wasn't quoting the fictional FORGOTTEN SOLDIER. Fritz adds nothing new to the discussion of German soldiers in WW II. SOLDAT is an excellent book, as other reviewers have mentioned. FRONTSOLDATEN is simply a collection of quotes from dubious sources - and all secondary ones at that. Fritz does not appear to have conducted a single interview on his own. How then can he claim to have any kind of grasp on the material? Anyone who describes this book as "scholarly" doesn't know the first thing about historical research. Fritz didn't research this book - he cribbed it. Spend your money elsewhere. For the English speaking world, we still have to wait for a definitive book on the Landser. ...
1,You know, I have wondered about the curious absence of people of color in all of Kinfolk's publications. I don't own their exclusive books or magazines, but I am inundated with the scrubbed beauty of it on pinterest and I have leafed through the book -- which took me all of 3 minutes. I confess, parts of Kinfolk are unattainably beautiful; the worn tables (I collect antiques, so, I have to confess, I have a weakness for old crap), the hanging herbs, the gorgeous settings, but if looked at closely, the arrangements with all the accoutrements and fine settings at their disposal come off as merely antiseptic and contrived, and this is because it is cultivated by the narrow-minded people who write the magazine who clearly have too much money and time and no clear relationship with even the smallest bit of diversity. The photos of girls with enormous floral halos on their heads is ridiculous. Everyone with their feet pigeon-toed just so, their manicured beards, their painstakingly curated outfits that they would like you to believe they found in the shed hanging from rusty nails. It's a world that I would never dream of living in. The obvious affluence made to appear worldly and 'earthy' has always made me roll my eyes and mutter 'this is what is wrong with the world today', like some old lady who has seen better times. I am a biracial person. It's odd to me that Kinfolk, and frankly a good number of these food blog celebs who are all just baby Kinfolk branches to the Kinfolk tree, don't have a single friend of color in any of their books or posts. Not one Latin-blooded person. Asian? Occasionally. Black? Oh, Lord, certainly not that. Just so odd that these 'artists' have come together to give their vision of the perfect world and it is one that lacks diversity and practicality (if I see one more rusty bowl with food in it, I am going to call the health and safety department). If this is the world seen through the lens of the Kinfolker, it is a limited and non-inclusive world indeed. Not my cuppa. I, for one, could not eat my gluten free, chia seed, fermented, organic, rare leaf salad sitting across from a unsmiling girl with twenty-seven pounds of flora teetering on her anorexic head without splitting my (black) sides with laughter. It's all just so pretentious and ridiculous. I wonder what those conversations are like at the table? Vapid, I would guess :/
1,It was an interesting book, but not as well-written as I would have liked.
1,The women in this book are interesting, although falling back on sex as the only survival tool is not the ideal action for EVERY woman in an entire book .... but they all lose their children by treachery of family or trusted friends and I find that most depressing, even if they all did get back together in the end.		So much loss - perhaps if I hadn't lost a daughter I wouldn't take these women losing theirs so hard, but it was just so sad.		She writes reasonably well, and the locations, practices of the day, dialogue all seem reasonable enough given the circumstances.
1,It was just an OK read.  I could see where the story was going immediately, but read the whole book.
1,The book started out ok- nothing gripping but ok. I'm sure I would have completed the book stopped at 20%. Everyone is entitled to read/like what they want and I choose not to read books full of the "f" word.
1,I started reading this series many years ago then stopped.  Recently I borrowed (thank goodness I didn't buy) the Kindle version of quite a few of them from the library and now I am remembering why I stopped reading.  At first they are entertaining. And, I do like the author's writing style.  But after a short while, I find myself getting so disgusted with the dumb things Goldy does and the author lets her get away with.  Even worse, Goldy lets everyone walk all over her all the while moaning about it. Worst of all, especially in this book, and at least one more close to this one in the series order, is how Goldy does not do a good job raising her son.  I believe part of being a good parent is setting limits,enforcing them, teaching good behavior, etc.  Goldy continuously gives in to Arch's demands for things she can not afford all the while letting him get away with extremely disrespectful behavior and even allowing him to endanger himself over and over by not knowing where he is, what he's doing, etc. while he lies to her.  She knows all of these things, but, when she starts to meekly ask him a question, he gets rude and she lets it go.  That is NOT being a good parent.  Then there are all the incredibly stupid gaps in logic that the reader must accept.  Do you really think a mall is not going to have video cameras on its entrances and parking lots?  Of course they should have been able to prove Julian was where he said he was loading things into the van, etc.  And, somehow the author forgot from a few chapters earlier that Julian had nearly been run down by the truck, too, with lots of witnesses to prove this.  In a different book Goldy and cohorts actually break Marla out of police custody by holding up an ambulance, and yet she gets away with no punishment for what is a serious crime.  Such unbelievable things are forced upon the reader over and over throughout these books, that I can only assume the author, who, from her bio, is quite well educated, must feel her readers are complete morons.  And, as I mentioned above, the author has a great writing style, so these things are truly a shame, she COULD do much, much better.
1,John Beversluis's book _C.S. Lewis and the Search for Rational Religion_ has a number of promising elements to it: his writing style is often fluid and enjoyable, he pledges to stick to a balanced, moderate treatment of  Lewis, and he quotes extensively from Lewis's works when appropriate.  Unfortunately, his arguments against what C.S. Lewis has to write are sadly  mistaken.  Though I think there are good points to some of his arguments,  and his caution towards exalting Lewis as a near-god are justified and  welcome, the very shallow and near-sighted interpretation he takes on the  works themselves is unfortunate, unjustified, and ultimately flawed.	  He takes C.S. Lewis to be of the most ignorant or devious nature in  setting forth his views and assumes that Lewis was either blissfully  ignorant of the true nature of the positions he was attacking or  dishonestly ignores their philosophical weight to make his task easier.  The fact of the matter is that C.S. Lewis's critiques are rather often  right on target.  John Beversluis reads Lewis in his poorest light  imaginable and then attacks straw men throughout--something he often  accuses Lewis of doing himself.  A more sophisticated and developed work is  needed if C.S. Lewis's positions are to be attacked with the force  Beversluis imagines he has used.  This book was out-of-print at the time  this review was written, and I think that is so for good reason.
1,Run of the mill romantic fiction. Couldn't finish it.
1,this book doesn't really match its title.  there seems to be very little of a mindfulness approach to anger.  it is more traditional anger management techniques, primarily CBT.  I kept reading to see if mindfulness would be incorporated but didn't find much.
1,The writing is extremely vivid.  But it's hard to work through an entire book on the merit of good prose if you just can't ever like the characters.  I could have cared less about the twists because I could have cared less about the characters.  If I'd been more invested in them, this would have been a stellar read.
1,I have read and enjoyed Sherryl Woods' books for sometime now.  I was very relieved to find out this was a book from the early nineties because the characters were not believable and the situation not compelling.  The idea of a murdered ministers loving wife falling in love within a month of his death seemed absurd especially when she thinks he is responsibe in some way.  Ms. Woods has come a long way thank goodness.
1,It was a tedious read.  I love World War II stories, but this took so long to get to it.
1,Poorly researched. Poorly written. Poorly edited. After 30 pages, I put it down. Don't bother
1,Horrible.  Did not give enough detail at all.  Basically gave a very broad overview that I think was not very well done.  I wanted ideas and directions.
1,I like david Sedaris but not this book.  I couldn't get into and I barely found it funny.  It was really long also.
1,I'll start with the good stuff, as I was taught in my college writing workshops: Scott Smith's THE RUINS is a page-turner with a flair for the horrid.  It's involving enough to keep you reading; evocative and atmospheric enough to put you in the midst of its unfolding survival drama; fluid enough to draw you onward and onward toward its inevitable, terrible climax.		Problem is, it's also bloated and empty, like a rich, tasty puff pastry with nothing but air inside.		In his review, Stephen King--who I've always admired as a writer, but not always agreed with as a reader--cites the inevitable cries of critics that THE RUINS is, at best, a short-story on steroids.  I'll be a little kinder than that and suggest that it would've made a smashing novella--50,000 to 80,000 words would've been enough, and would've served the subject and the characters admirably.  As THE RUINS has more than a little in common with the late Algernon Blackwood's fine, weird tales of preternatural dread (THE WILLOWS comes to mind), then Smith probably would've benefited from taking a page from Blackwood's book of weird and focusing his narrative.		But at 500+ pages, THE RUINS, like an inefficient tractor-trailer, is burning too much fuel to run hard and steady for destination: nowhere. By dipping into a few of the other reviews here, I'm clearly not the only reader who thought Smith's characters were weak, at best: refugees from a thousand B horror films where the victims are always young, hot college students who meet basic criteria: the hero; the virgin; the funny guy; the slut (and Smith DOESN'T get a pass just because he was clever enough to comment upon this type-casting in the course of the story). The upside of all this is that the film version, due out in April, will most likely work beautifully simply because there is only 90 minutes worth of screen story in this 500 page book.		Remember Stephen King's own THE RAFT, a not-bad-but-not-great little survival tale that was adatped in CREEPSHOW 2?  Same dynamic; same quartet; just a different setting.  And at least King had the decency to keep his tale of attempted survival against a preternatural menace short and sweet.		I probably wouldn't have bothered to write this review, except that I've grown really tired of being disappointed by high-profile books that seem to have their praises sung endlessly with little dissent, that turn out to be mediocre at best, dazzling but empty at worst.  Don't even get me started on THE DA VINCI CODE . . .		To close, if you're really looking for a fine horror survival tale about the menace of nature, check out Tim Lebbon's "White" in the novella collection FEARS UNNAMED.  It has all the drive, power, and dread of THE RUINS, but it clocks in at a lean, mean 60,000 words.  The rest of the novellas in the collection are outstanding, too.
1,The title is deceiving. Its really about how to be an oil painter in Dali's time period. He talks about mixing weird things in the paints which are probably hard to find in 2014. This is by no means a step-by-step how to book. It is a hard read, meaning, he says a lot of abstract things.	He has weird ideas about when one should have sex (see pg 69), recommends having spiders in your studio, when to sleep or stay awake.	I don't think one would get much out of this book. The only thing I got out of the book was that Dali was passionate about painting and willing to sleep very little in order to paint as much as possible. Painting was his life. Other than that, I didn't learn much about actual painting.
1,Book was missing several pages and was cut up. Very disappointed.
1,Good story line, but felt the book ended mid-story. Did not appreciate being left hanging and having to purchase another book to see how the story ends. You want to follow an author because they write good stories, not because they are forcing you to purchase their next book!
1,Although glossy and pretty, this Atlas might have been published in the 1950s...nothing about the style and choices has been updated from a large Atlas I owned as a child.  I am not complaining about the data and the map details, I have no doubt that they are current.  I object to the editorial choices, which seem ridiculous in the internet age.  Sure, if you have the internet, you probably don't need an atlas.  But about 100 percent of Amazon customers have some access to the internet.  IMO, a "new concise" Atlas should not bother including every small town in the world.  Nor should it include roads except in remote places.  I want a handy, big-picture reference especially pertaining to areas of the world that are frequently in the news like the Middle East, which is poorly covered.  The area of the Suez Canal is tiny, for example.  Everywhere, the maps are crammed full of names of minor places and roads such that the big geographic and political features are obscured.  There is only one map that shows the entire Black Sea and that is a map that also shows all of Russia so the Black Sea is about one inch from East to West.  If you want to know the exact location of the Ukranian village of your ancestors, this is something to save for the internet.  And, especially, the roads to get you there are not needed on this map, where they could not possibly be adequate.  What I want is to get a big look of the Black Sea within its political context of neighbors and geography to help me make sense of the news and history.  I don't want to find some small town and how to get there.		I concede that the design of a reference work like this is determined by a large number of choices and judgments and nothing will satisfy everyone.  But generally I think that publishers are misguided in thinking everybody always wants a roadmap.  Totally unsatisfying to me, and I am returning it.
1,Borrowed from overdrive through my local library.		This book sucks. I found all references to vampires exceptionally annoying, got about 75% of the way through before I got sick of it and couldn't listen any more.		The voice actor is amazing. Phenomenal performance. Story is great, except the actual Vampire stuff. I enjoyed the way the book was laid out, though. As though it's one big book report summary of his life, with crap added on for novelty.
1,Yuck, I think I'd rather have a root canal than read another book of this series.
1,When I find an author of mysteries that I like, I stick by them.  I read a variety of things but have found some really stellar mystery authors who make reading a pleasure.  This used to be the case with Cornwell's novels but, alas, I find that it isn't so any longer.		There was a huge gap between my reading of this novel and the one that preceeded it, the one in which Benton Wesley supposedly died such a gruesome death.  That death in and of itself has a lot to do with why I've taken such a long break between Cornwell novels.  While some level of violence in a murder mystery novel is certainly unavoidable, I felt like Cornwell delved into some really unnecessarily graphic territory in the last novel I read.  This one wasn't any different.  The pure sadism of the Chandonnes and the sidekick Bev is revolting and basically left me paranoid.  I'm not denying that such evil exists in the world but, call me crazy, I'd rather not know about it.  I think Cornwell has lost sight of the fact that a novel can be very scary by the judicious use of implied violence.  The gore is really unnecessary and better left to Stephen King, in my opinion.		My other gripe with this book is all the technical jargon that's in it.  It's unnecessary, distracting and, frankly, boring.  Cornwell knows her stuff.  I don't think anyone's denying that and she really doesn't need to prove it.  She's hardly the only author given to descending into techno babble when she writes about her field but hers somehow comes across as more condescending.  When she's dashing off such language, it seems like she's bragging and not like she's in character.  I think the perfect example of this is the passage in which Scarpetta snobbishly suggests which over-the-counter medications the Baton Rouge coroner might want to take for his cold.  Was this really necessary?		The characters in this story aren't much better.  The Chandonne brothers practically have the word "psychopath" tattooed across their foreheads.  Scarpetta is there in body but not in spirit.  It might have been beneficial for her to have some inner dialogue about her grief.  No such luck.  Lucy is becoming more and more petulant as time goes by and less interesting because of it.  Benton Wesley is just plain despicable, manipulating people and exposing them to great physical and psychological danger simply so that he can fufill his agenda.		And that is my last gripe.  The overall plot wanted to justify the acts contained within but it doesn't.  The irony of it is that Scarpetta's characters don't seem to realize that their actions are just as appalling as those of the men and women they're pursuing.  Scarpetta claims to dislike vigilantism but this is nothing more than a weak protest as, in the end, she doesn't seem to have much of a problem with all the terrible things the people around her have done.  The book totally peters out at the end and smacks of an author rushing to meet a deadline.  Storylines are left hanging in the wind and characters that were supposedly important in some way are disposed with in a manner that is reminiscent of the best of soap opera writing.		My suggestion is to not waste your time.  If you want to read some worthwhile mystery, you're far better off with Tami Hoag, Sue Grafton, Elizabeth George, or P.D. James.
1,I love Daphne, and her writing style is great. Her idea is great - but her recipes are not for me. she makes them sound easy while she describes them, but they are not as easy as they seem to her for me
1,I have read every book in the series and will continue to, but Anita has lost a lot of her kick butt nature. She was a heroine, but now she almost seems a secondary character to her extremely over done love life. I am sad that she has lost what made her who she was to all the men in her life.
1,O'Reilly claims he's been investigating Kennedy's assassination for many many years and Mr. No Spin Zone comes up with an entire book filled with absolutely no new information.  What a sad disappointment.  But the really annoying part was the writing -- so formulaic and breathlessly dramatic.  It takes foreshadowing to a new level.  Every single section of the book (a section is between one paragraph and 1-2 pages long) ends with a dramatic "clincher" that directly refers to the coming assassination.  Apparently the public murder of a sitting president was not dramatic enough in and of itself.  The whole book was just trite and useless, and without O'Reilly's name on the cover, I am certain it never would have reached publication.
1,In praise of Crichton's new book, I can say that it was fun to read, but not much else.  It's very obvious from the writing that he did quite a bit of research into the Middle Ages, but there's very little that would be new information to anyone who's taken any European history course.  The quantum theory he uses to justify what is essentially a form of time travel is based in fact, but fantastic descriptions littered with meaningless jargon place the process well outside the boundary of reality.  The plot devices he uses are old and threadbare, and the characters are stereotypical to an absurd degree.  He did keep the plot moving, however, and taken as nothing more than a typical action book, it was a decent read.
1,This is a delightful book.  It is easy reading and fills in the cracks in what you know about WC.  Very worthwhile if you want to know the read man.
1,Many of you are apprently unaware that Tommy Tenney was a UPC pastor and has been a part of the Brownsville/Toronto Blessing scene for a long time.  He left the UPC over the issue of legalism but has never denounced their other heresies such as their anti-Trinitarianism and baptismal regeneration.  Tenney is clearly adding works to salvation in God Chasers, as he has done all along with other UPC doctrines.  Do true believers really want to buy this book and follow Tenney's recomendations?  I would like to pose a number of questions.  You only need to read the title of this book to see that this is an unbibilical book.  Here are 10 things to think about:	(1) Whatever happened to following Christ? (1 Pet. 2:21) (2) Is God going so fast that we have to run to keep up? (2 Pet. 3:9) (3) Do we really chase God or does He chase us? (John 16:8) (4) Isn't this book just an advertisement to try to get true believers to submit to the false anointing from the hands of the falsely anointed? (1 Jn. 2:20) (5) If Christians are chasing God but running away from His Word (trail) what is the profit? (Ps. 119:105) (6) If we are running in God's "tracks" shouldn't we look at the trail once in awhile to see where He wants us to go? (2 Tim. 3:15) (7) What is the major doctrinal reason Tenney wrote this book?  Answer: Pelegianism (8) Isn't chasing God adding works to grace? (Eph. 2:8-9)	and the big one ...	(9) Why chase God when true believers already have the Holy Spirit within them? (Eph. 1:13) Wouldn't it be better to obey God and preach the gospel of salvation rather than the gospel of signs and wonders? (10) What exactly is Tommy Tenney chasing? Answer: A name for himself and money.
1,A major disappointment!  This material is from the late 1800's or early 1900's making it a challenge to just get through.  The only redeeming value to this book, if one is so inclined, it is one of the original sources for the material for the modern day "Secret."  Do NOT waste your money or time on this book.  I'm learning the hard way books from Wilder Publications in Radford, VA are simply very bad reprints of the original information sold through Amazon.com.  The subject matter is very difficult to read.  I would guess they have no inventory of quality books as on the bottom of the last page it shows a date of printing this book of April 1, 2010 and I ordered it the end of March.  Go Figure???  If you complain, Amazon waste no time in giving a full refund as I believe they know what a poor product Wilder Publications is producing.  Save yourself the trouble and frustration.  This whole experience with Wilder Publications killed it for me as a complete distraction to the message and I wanted to kill the messenger.
1,Although I any not agree with most of their beliefs, I respect Republicans. They are good patriots and their heart is in the right place. It is just that they are allowing the wrong TV channel to poison their thoughts. And even worse books. Such as this one.		Apart from the inflammatory title (and I had not heard such lame line since my elementary school days! What is next? "We are blue rubber, you're red glue"?), ANN COULTER's book never takes off. Sure, an evil, throaty buh-ha-ha here and there but even her heart isn't into it - why should anybody else's?	I guess she knows that, once more, she is preaching only to the choir. That is why if one were to squeeze the pages of this book, there would be enough vitriol to poison, say, a mid-size Kurdish town. That also is why this book is a only a compilation of recycled older material, collated randomly and with no purpose other than push some more paper to her fans.		Is this the best answer to Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart? Honestly?	The GOP controls the White House; it controls the Supreme Court; its control of the media has made the Democratic congress to self-castrate; yet, they could not possibly have a worse image. Ever wonder why? (yes, apart from the war, the tortures and vetoing poor children's health care). LACK OF REAL HUMOR!		Lack of humor is indicative of lack of perspective and perceptiveness. Lacking that will eventually get you in a youth-grinding war-for-the-oil. With no ground to stand on. As a last resort, the likes of Ann Coulter are called in.		You have heard Bill O'Reilly shout and swear when reality does not agree with him? Insulting, biased, illogical and picking fights only with the weakest targets?	Well, this is the bland blond book version.		A doubt that any thinking Republican would enjoy this. Let alone a Democrat.
1,this is such an interesting subject that this man has disgraced. people like this give a bad name to people making a true attempt at discovering the truth, such as Graham Hancock. pitiful. stay away from this garbage.
1,Lips Touch is dark yet mystifying as you read the three different stories in this book. I had trouble connecting with the characters and feel that this book is for those who don't mind reading about death, goblins and many other dark characters. The Illustrations were beautifully done by Jim Di Bartolo who helped give you a inside view of what the author's characters looked like.
1,I started reading this book because it is on so many "top 100" and "must reads" lists.  I made it about 2/3rds of the way through before giving up on this boring and pointless story.  I cannot for the life of me figure out why this guy is a so-called great author.  He is second rate.  Seriously.
1,I didn't even read it
1,Was looking for the original version that would mirror the movie with a classic feel. This was NOT it. Returned. Disappointed. Can't find what I want anywhere. This book has some screen play from another writer inside. Boo!
1,I was disappointed in this book. There is a little information that is useful that could be contained in a 2-3 page magazine article, but it is buried in a lot of repetitious fluff.		Several things irritated me: 1) how he projects adult feelings onto children too young to think that way, as in the child wanting to watch the same TV show as peers--sorry, they are not thinking of it in terms of a "cultural experience"; 2) assuming that "natural consequences" is always practiced without any concern for mitigating circumstances--most parents would ask why a raincoat was left behind, and THEN do something, or not, depending on the answer; 3) the teenager missing dinner. Is he kidding? I don't know anyone who does that--the teen heats up his own leftovers; 4) his insistence that any form of "time-out" is actually "love-withdrawal".  Good grief.		The way he deals with tantrums (well, in his case, a "sit-down strike" by his child, hardly a "tantrum" judging from what I've seen in stores on occasion) by essentially waiting them out works for him because he apparently is self-employed and can make his own schedule--he probably does have lots of spare time. Many parents are not in his situation--they have appointments, are maybe shopping with two or more children at the same time, etc.		Bottom line: read this book at the library first. This is the second book of his that I've read, and he seems to be long on complaining about the problem but short on real, workable solutions.
1,After receiving an audiobook for Christmas and enjoying it, I decided to listen to some of my favorite books while driving to work. I accidently bought the abridged version of Outlander. I thought they would only edit it a little so I opened it and listened to the first CD. The book is completely ruined in my opinion. They took out all the lovely backgground people and places. Plus the sex! After listening to the first CD, I bought the unabridged version which is 28 cds instead of 8. The new one is wonderful. It makes me want to get into the car to go to work! I will never buy an abridged version again!!
1,Started off slightly interesting. Story seemed quite far fetched in the end. Her vulnerabilities were heartbreaking. At least it was free.
1,I found the story line to be very insulting to the intelligent reader.
1,I love Mark Salzman's novels.  I can sense the goodness of the author implied by those works.  I can sense the goodness of the reporter of True Notebooks.  I think it is great to teach troubled kids how to express themselves in writing.  Good work!  But that does not mean that I really want to immerse myself in their efforts.  After reading a few examples of the students' efforts, I have the picture.  But really, none of it is very surprising.  The students produce the sort of thing you would expect.  There is no development in Salzman's account of his experience either.  He seems to have become swept up in his own surprise that these young people are capable of any expression at all.
1,i have never read such a politically bias book. ALL democrats are evil and the devil personified and ALL republicans are saints just trying to save the usa. how does the writer get away with such drivel? i read 2/3s of the book hoping for a peek of sanity and balance from the writer's viewpoint but it never appeared. all i can say is he needs to take his sophomoric view of the world being all black and white and find a different career-maybe work on bringing back the inquisition.
1,WHAT A LET DOWN.  What should have been a great ending to a wonderful series was a wasted opportunity by these two authors.  It was clich and predictable.  Neferet deserved a much better story line (she was a formidable villain who was able to bind the soul of an immortal and send him to a realm that a goddess banished him from to kill the heroine; called forth the white bull who is the epitome of darkness and become his consort; build a vessel from the soul of Zoey's mother to do her bidding and cause chaos) than to end up in a hotel with a party planner and human supplicants.  It was utterly unimaginative and just lazy.  It would have been better if P.C. Cast hadn't written it at all.  I for one will not be looking for either of these authors to read in the future.
1,as far as this book & the series goes  one star is tooooooooo much for it
1,Times are changing, & religious beliefs are being constantly modified, but here is something that you see about once or twice in a decade.	The judeo-xian babble has always been curtialed, translated, & modernized, despite the final passage in the book of Revelations of not changing or excising any part of the fictional text. But as usual, this was an incremental process. In time, revised editions were published, as public attitudes changed, became more permissive, & more programmed.	The Apocrypha, or, the deleted chapters in the babble, became so, when first the Dewey, then the King James versions were publicised. The Dewy version was conveniently modified to suit the dogma of the catholic religion. Even studious priests knew onlt vague references of these "forbidden books", which relate the nazarene's childhood, & travels abroad, both of which resulted in rather unchristianly behaviour. The church could not risk any blemishes on their "saviour's" precious reputation! To have them released would promore congregation fall-out & free-thinking-----they couldn't have that!	The King James babble became sanctioned by the royal seal of approval, but it was really the (...) of the clergy who controlled the government. And more was modified by translators & scribes under his majesty's orders. As snip here, a clip there, an inference installed, a small semi-noticable addition made, whatever suited the rulers at the time. The babble, & religion, was as influential then, as the letharginator {TV} is now.	The latest version come is The Oxford Annotated Bible. Sounds impressive. The name of a prestegious educational institution on the cover....."gee, they MUST be right!" What makes this version particularly notable, is its placating of "political correctness". This is The Politically Correct Bible. Granted, all have been so, as they were invented to regulate man's behaviour, but never has there been such a blatantly conformist version such as this.	For instance, the xian wimps' treasured 'lord's prayer' itself, has been changed to suit the femasculists. Now, it's "our father-mother, who art in heaven"! It sounds like a weakan scheme to intigrate their blindlight idiotology, with xian foolosophy! A possible new-age take-over? Not likely.	References to "darkness" have been changed, as to not offend the "fine sensibilities" of racists who think that everything is a pigmentation issue. Inferences to the story about jews killing jesus are carefully dissected & excised. They are re-writing mythistory here. The other babbles will become obsolete, & future generations will be brainwashed with this version instead.	Consider this.....A xoid who still preaches & reads out of the older babbles being called 'a nut' by his own kind. Being accused of fabricating translations, & trying to bring an incorrect, arcane text into a mytheological discussion. "That's the OLD bible, WE only read out of the NEW one now...it's got a better translation." What they are REALLY thinking, if they had a shred of honesty to admit it, is "...this new translation is a lot better, I don't have to work at being so 'good' so hard".	This is not a "better translation", but a modified agenda disguised as such. Somebody decided to push some issues & gain credibility. What better way than through the holey scriptures to justify a cause? Such as the wider acceptance of women into the blindlight priesthood? And in the reverandship?	By & large, The Oxford Annotated Bible is a fell-good, please-everybody book of ubiquitus fairy-tales. The babble is now even MORE of a joke, as it now, more than ever, reads like a federal document, a liberal bill, rather than a stupornatural arcanum. Will it get passed? Probably. The braying nincompoops will follow. They care more for what everynone ELSE is doing, & copy it, rather than investigating The Torah, the New Testament, The Dead Sea Scrolls, & other blindlight babbles for that matter.
1,I am not a paid reviewer.  I waded through this book and did some of the exercises to help me really focus on some of the root causes of my belief around food and my eating habits.  There are some good ideas that Mary O'Malley offers to help her reader get to a specific self-awareness about their struggle with dieting and other compulsion.  However, this book is not a straight-forward self-help type of read.  With that said, anyone who approaches this book can find something that may help them with better understanding and managing their compulsions.  Unfortunately, I was not that person.
1,I hate to criticize such a good author but she really should have paid someone else to read her books aloud.  Her voice sounded nasally throughout and, as pointed out in another review, the voice she uses for Annie is whiny and grating.  Thank goodness my 8 year-old did not complain of these issues but I do plan to put all the books on his MP3-player so he can listen with headphones and not irritate everyone else in the car.
1,I read this authors latest one, The Barkeep....and thought that was great , so I thought I'd try another. This book was totally not up to my expectations. Without going on about it, I'll say that I found it very boring, skipping over long sections, and, finally giving up about halfway through.
1,The most useless fitness book I've ever purchased.
1,2.5 rating.		After reading the blurb, I was excited to read this book. I don't care for short stories because there is almost never enough development in character or plot to make it worth the time spent. Per Amazon, the page count was just over 200 pages which is my limit. This book felt much shorter. There was no meat to the story and everything happened without any build up or tension. Without the proper development, I just didn't care. Additionally, there were grammar issues which were blatant enough to pull me out of what little story there was. I still gave this a 2.5 because there seems to be a large audience for short, shallow stories that can be read quickly.
1,Good information - but way too many words than what was required to say the same thing. I feel the information was extrapolated to make it book size - I would have preferred more visual/graphic examples and less fluff
1,The book's title, "The Way Things Ought to Be" is wrong.  If things were the way Rush wants, then America would be a vastly different place than we know and love.  I read the book because I wanted to know what drives all of Rush's fans.  In summary, they are being told what they want to hear, and only that.		I used to love the old Diane Rhem show on NPR.  She'd have two guests in to discuss an issue.  The pro-guest got 1/2 hour to give his/her best explanation for why they were pro.  Diane would interrupt only to make sure that a point was clear.  Then, in the next 1/2 hour the con-guest got their turn.  At the end of the hour I always felt like I had a far greater understanding of the issue, and my opinions generally moderated to somewhere between the pro and the con viewpoints.		With Rush's book there is only one view -- his.  He makes no real attempt to argue against other viewpoints.  For him, the alternative views simply do not exist.  I liken it to advocacy as opposed to reporting.  A good reporter is supposed to cover the issues thoroughly.  A good advocate is supposed to major on the points that support his/her position, and ignore or minimize the points that might weaken his/her position.  Rush is a master advocate.  But don't go to his book for any expansion of your understanding -- other than to learn what he is advocating.		Whether you be far left, far right, or in between, it is wise to know and understand what drives others to hold different political stances than yours.  And you cannot get a true understanding of the opposition from an advocate.  It is quite like asking a fundamentalist Muslim to describe a fundamentalist Christian -- or vice versa.  Either one will give you a very warped viewpoint.  So will Rush.		America's greatness is not its people.  We are no more special than many other groups of peoples.  We have bright people and stupid people.  So does every other country.  America's greatness comes not from some special genes in Americans, but from our particular rule of law and government of, by and for the people.  It is our particular, special form of government that causes people from other countries to want to come here.  Here they can move upward in accordance with their abilities and their ambition.  In many countries abilities and ambition will not get them anything but trouble.  In many countries upward mobility belongs to the select classes exclusively. If you listen too much to Rush, you'd think we were the worst of the worst in terms of governance.  It simply isn't so.  If it were, we wouldn't have so many people from other countries trying to come here.  Rush loves to aggrandize Americans and trash our government.  This feeds prejudices, but does nothing to help us improve our governance.		If you like Rush's shows, listen to them.  But also listen to other viewpoints, and not Rush's explanation of what those are.  He is, after all, an advocate, not a reporter.
1,Not up to Coben's standards! Story lacked continuity. Jumped around from one character to another. Should have had more chapter breaks. If this were the first book I read by him, it would be the last! Don't waste your time or your money on this one!
1,I stopped reading halfway through. Images in a an erotic novel was such a lame idea. Then the characters needed fleshing out. And finally  there wasn't enough connection between Francine/Madeleine to believe they're the same person. I will say great idea, but not executed well.
1,This is the first in series of books by this author with the three main characters being magical sisters who are put in the position of being the front line of a humongous magical war.  The book series alternate who is telling the story beginning with the with full-blooded which sister to the magical were-cat Sister to the vampire sister.
1,Story dragged on forever & finally fizzled into a "Who cares" ending.  Waste of time
1,Not interesting. Stopped reading after 50 pages
1,Not funny or fun like the show.
1,I thought I would like this author and this book, but, sad to say, I didn't. The story just didn't seem to go anywhere. This isn't a top notch authors by any stretch of the imagination, but he did have some good descriptions of Florida and the denizens, but the story was just lacking. I read about 90% of the book and asked myself if I really wanted to invest any more time. Do, I didn't.
1,<kind of joking> You know the game where you drink every time someone does or says something? Well, if I took a sip for every incorrect security statement in this "book" I would die of alcohol poisoning in the first 50 pages.</kind of joking>		Download the SP800 series from NIST and you will be much better off. And yes I did pass my exam on the first try because I ignored everything in this book. This book will not help you for the exam.
1,Very misleading -- there are pictures for 1000 knit and crochet hats. Some of them absolutely fabulous!! However, you only get 10 patterns for 10 hats. It does provide contact information for the people who submitted the other 990 hats. Normally I read the reviews and this only reaffirms that I will read reviews in the future to ensure I won't make the same mistake a 2nd time.
1,Not a great book by any means. I felt it was slow and predictable  yet it was not a bad way to pass a very tiny bit of time. Not a book worth reading again. I was curious aboutt it after I heard it was being made into a movie. That is the only reason I read it. Curiosity didn't kill this cat but it nearly bored me to death.
1,this book is so slow and has way to much detail. i have skipped big chunks of the book just to get to  a decent part i am not sure i will finish it..why did some people give this five stars ? i give it two and that is being nice...thank god it was only 99 cents...
1,Wish I could put zero stars, poorly written. Mr. "R" King you will never ever come close to reaching the calliber of the "Real" Stephen King. Go back to college and learn to write a sentence.
1,super poor ending. Wish I never bought
1,I rarely stop reading a book, but I made it about 16% and couldn't read any further.  It was redundant, simplistic and contrived.  Over and over again the reader is told Olivia doesn't do relationships.  We definitely got it by the third time.  The feelings between the characters were so fast and not natural.  It didn't pull me into the story, and I didn't connect with the characters.  I am really surprised this book is a best seller and there are so many glowing reviews.
1,It just dragged on. and ended where it began so you keep reading the sequels! a waste of time
1,I was eager to read this book as I have appreciated Jennifer Freyd's previous work on abuse, betrayal and memory. However, this book loses credibility due to its politicized examples and dubious conclusions based on political bias. It could almost be called Blind to Bias because it seems at times that the authors have a blindness to certain facts and objectivity in examples due to their all too obvious progressive political bias.		It is too bad too because I think the theory they postulate is correct. But in their many examples, they give passes to progressive political figures like Hillary Clinton for her "blindness" to her husband's serial infidelity, citing only one biased source, Hillary's own biographer, Gail Sheehy, while ignoring copious other sources that suggest that Hillary not only knew full well about the affairs, but also had a hand in brutally shutting down any woman who dared to come forward as one of her husband's victims.		And they have a similar "blind bias" against conservative figures, stating for instance that people only believed Colin Powell when he suggested that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction because we all suffered from betrayal blindness, as if evidence actually led to other conclusions and we were being outright lied to, but were all blind to these because we were overpowered by the Bush Administration. But what is true and well documented is that back then, EVERYBODY believed Iraq had WMDs, including the CIA, NSA and the UN - even Bill Clinton during his own presidency, and then-Senator John Kerry!		I had to finally stop reading at this one.		This is so sad that these faulty and "blindly biased" examples were used to illustrate what is most certainly a true theory. I am very disappointed.
1,RJ thought I'd like, ad nauseum
1,The book gets good towards the end. Easy to read but writing is mediocre.  Seems very self-serving and author talks about how sad it was to live in a guest house for "Free" and how feeding on $17 a day at Trader Joes was such a hardship -- oh, and how horrible it was to spend his inheritance money on various investments.  Although I completely identify with him, I think he wrote in a way to is not accessible to the masses. The name dropping was definitely very Hollywood.  But, having said that, it did have some inspirational words. towards the end.  It's an easy book you can ready in a day or two so if you can get past the annoying parts, it will be ok.  But I would prefer to read Eckhart Tolley again or M. Williamson.
1,I bought this book because I wanted to see what all the hoopla was about with the play. Quite frankly, I didn't like the book. I don't agree with the way it's been presented or the idea that the play helps women who suffer from domestic violence. I bought the book. I'm glad I didn't spend the money or waste my time on the play.
1,Save your money.	I don't even know where to start. The whole thing is just stupid. I couldn't even bring myself to complete it.
1,I eagerly anticipated the release date of this book, as I have sort of a "personal connection" of sorts to Jadakiss.  First, he is from my 'hood,  Second, I was in a relationship with a close uncle of his for several years.  Because of this, I'd some opportunities  to interact with kiss, so I was curious to hear what Winter had to say. What struck me immediately was her plodding, childish writing style.  She writes like an eighth grader, and it really takes away from the tale she is trying to tell.  Unfortunately, she has no clue whatsoever how to tell it. To be honest, the writing really took away from the book.  Had it been better written, it would definitely be a page turner.  I would, very sincerely, advise her publisher to hire an editor that actually knows how to read and write English, re-edit this book, and then re-release it. Whomever hired that editor and allowed this book to be released to the world in its present form.should be fired!!!
1,I'm very disappointed that I didn't get the cover image when I purchased this book for my Kindle.  Customer service could not find a solution to this problem.  Not having the image reduced my enjoyment of this book.
1,While there were moments of beautiful,  descriptive passages,I was not invested in any of the characters while reading. It felt like a was eavesdropping on someone's mindless internal chatter. Not a book that I would recommend.
1,The story line was interesting but the development of the characters was poor to say the least. It was like reading about high schooler's conversations . I'm sorry I wasted my time.
1,Very poor book.  I am a fan of Anne Rule but this book is not up to her standard.  I was disappointed.
1,In a nutshell , it was boring. Long descriptions of characters that were not relevant to story line. Minutia of detail about nothing.	No suspense.	The word thriller is attached to description and I felt it was far from anything that was thrilling.
1,Let me start off by saying that I have LOVED all of the previous books by Delores Gordon-Smith in this series; I can't even imagine what happened during the writing of this chapter in the stories of Jack Haldean, but "After the Exhibition" was painful!!!  I was able to get through about 75 pages of this mystery and had to give up!  I certainly hope the next in the series is back on track; I'm looking forward to next year's release.
1,Did not read. Tried to donate. They didn't want it. Threw it away.
1,I am a huge time travel romance fan. I find this story didn't deliver. Not because of the way a character time travelled, but because there was so much head hopping. There were times I was just so confused because the POV jumped around ALOT. I just feel the author could have alleviated a lot of confusion by sticking to the 2 lead characters. Also, I feel like the author rushed the ending a bit. True there's an HEA, sort of. The epilogue would have been better served to revolve around the leads and not the secondary and certainly NOT to intro the next book in the series.		There were some major editing issues in the book. Enough that I felt it detracted from the story. It's a shame too, the storyline had potential to be a really good one.
1,Oh well, I might read the whole thing sooner or later. Too much religion for me. It would be better if the bible stuff was out.
1,Not my normal choice of reading I tried for a change of subject.  I prefer historical, classics, and  books on ancient royalty Found the plot OK but the language did not impress me and I thought the Author jumped backwards and forwards too often to hold my interest. Not my cup of tea.
1,It's never a good sign when you finish a $22.00 hardcover in about an hour, maybe a paperback but never a hardcover.  Overall, I echo the thoughts of others - the book was too short and needed more character development.  Burn was better than Ice.  That's rather sad when you consider that Burn was a three star book.  It's a shame that Linda Howard is now putting out this type of book.  She's a better writer than this. Even at the Amazon price of $11.00 I'd recommend checking the library for this title.
1,Disappointed it uses a word we don't  allow.
1,I wanted to like this and their other books. I saw them on youtube and they seemed so lovely. All the dialect of the nature spirits sounds like children reading from "i can haz cheezburger?"		Infantile. I don't think these spirits are our children but our equals or better.
1,I was intrigued by the summary of this book by Amazon and since it was highly rated,  I selected it as my Kindle First selection.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME READING THIS BOOK.  I had a tough time reading it because I was just not interested in what was going on.  I didn't care about the fireflies even though they played a big part in the early segment of the book.  I did not care what happened to the characters (although initially I felt bad for the young boy and at times started to care about the daughter) because the writing was so shallow and they had no redeeming features.  I only finished the book because I always finish my books and was slightly (at best) curious to see how it ended.  What a mistake.  The first part of the book at least was readable but once you went back 11 years,  the book just went downhill.  This is maybe the worst book I have read in the last decade.
1,This book started off great.  Good suspense, fascinating insights into life in Vatican City (its own nation).  And the author has a way with words and some creative turns of phrases that make for pleasant reading.  But the book is way overlong and drags in the middle.  Any sense of this book being a "thriller" is long gone by the halfway point.  But worst of all is the failure of this book to provide a coherent plot that is in the least bit plausible.		Spoiler alert: if you plan on reading this book anyway, you might want to stop here.  But for those looking for some advice as to whether they should invest the many hours it will take to get through it, take note.  While the author seems to extol the brilliant biblical scholarship of his main character, that so-called brilliance rests in a conclusion that the Gospel of John is unreliable and fictional in part because it includes facts about the crucifixion of Jesus that are not mentioned in the Synoptic gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke.  And based upon this silly conclusion, the book declares the Shroud of Turin a forgery because it shows wounds of Jesus that only John mentions and, therefore, must not have actually been inflicted.  Similar to the nonsense in The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown, supposedly a 6th century "Fifth Gospel" showed that the Church tried to cover up an obscure monk's "discovery" that John's Gospel was not accurate as given to us in the New Testament.		It is always amazing to me that so many people, especially so-called biblical scholars, think they have discovered errors and deceptions in the New Testament from their vantage point of twenty centuries later and their comfortable academic offices.  The authorities who determined which gospels were true and what should be in them had their lives on the line.  Now there's a real incentive to determine the truth since martyrdom awaited those who proclaimed the truth of Jesus Christ.  Not to mention their vantage point of 18-19 centuries closer to the actual events.		If you like the Jesus Seminar and all that revisionist nonsense; if you think maybe Jesus did marry Mary Magdalene and become a royal family in France; if you think the apostles and contemporaneous disciples of Jesus invented his resurrection and miracles in order to get themselves tortured and killed--then this book is for you.  Add it to the tall pile of balderdash that tries but always fails to obscure the stunning story of the Son of God and his redemptive work for mankind.
1,I bought this book from Amazon and I guess that it was used.  The value of this book is an on-line strenghts assessment that is good for one user only.  I contacted the company and told them I was not able to log on. They told me that the password they gave me was already used and I was not eligible to take the assessment.  They could not help me since I didn't do enough due diligence before buying the book. "Buyer beware."		This book has very little information without the on-line assessment and becomes worthless to anyone other than the original purchaser.		I would be very wary about buying anything by marcus buckingham.
1,This book was just dumb! The relationship between Lanya and Sacario was a mess. The brothers were a mess and this story was a mess. The way it ended I can't tell if its a part 2 or just a bad ending. I want my .99cents back!
1,The author tries hard but just doesn't pull it together...it is a weak story...and parts of it have you saying 'ah come on!!!' to yourself they are so far fetched. There are a couple of storylines going through this book and none of them are particularly good. I will not be purchasing Lincoln Munroe number 2.
1,I got bored with this book quickly
1,There was no real plot to the book and so much of time was spent on general descriptions having nothing to do with the story. Unfortunately I refuse to not finish a book once I start as I keep believing there has to be something redeeming in it. However this time there was nothing. A pure waste of time.
1,This book spends most of it's pages telling you how the food industry has sucked us into eating high calorie foods and actually becoming "addicted" to them. When I finally got to the chapters near the end that I thought would give new advice on how to overcome these cravings, it was just the same old, same old:  cognitive therapies, how to distract yourself, change your thinking, take a walk, etc. This may be news for some folks, but it sure isn't for me.
1,Why do I have the previous book instead of "Going Down Hard". I see others have had this problem as well. This needs fixing now.
1,This book does not have a very rigorous approach to causation. The applied parts are lacking as well -- they apply the suggested models in empirical examples but that's literally it - they just run the models and read the numbers, no insightful interpretation of anything, no justification and so on. If you want to read something informal but applied, go to Mostly Harmless Econometrics by Angrist and Pischke. If you want to read something rigorous, go to Causality by Judea Pearl.
1,Extremely, unsatisfying book to end this series!  The ending felt week. It was a chore just to finish reading it.
1,I received this book free from the publisher for an honest review and I must say, though I like the idea of the Djinn and being mixed myself, seeing a mixed heroine was a nice turn for me, but the story itself was all over the place just like Sebastian's mood and reactions. Right from the beginning it felt like the author wasn't in touch with her inner teen self. I felt awkward reading some points of the story, because it didn't feel genuine, but rather forced. While the story as a whole was not bad, I couldn't bring myself to love it and I wanted to so badly! The book had so much promise. The lore of the djinn and how it was incorporated with the other creatures was great, but not enough to bring me back for more unfortunately.
1,Lacking.
1,Have some real doubts about this story. Poor editing but easy to read.  Doubt the veracity of the content though.
1,Loved his earlier books, but found this one dull.
1,Sorry. Just didn't like it. Totally written in a way that was...just confusing so i decided i could do without it.
1,I attended several days of the third trial in the real story of John Lewis McPhearson killing his wife Irma in Choctaw County, Alabama in 1959. I witnessed the testimonies of many of the witnesses and Roderick Beddow's summation to the jury.		There are a number of problems with this "fictionalized" account. The first is that Choctaw County becomes Henderson County, but Brown keeps the real town names. Brown describes the main product of the county as "lodgepole pine." This species does not grow within 1000 miles of Alabama. The nearest lodgepole pine forests are in Colorado. He describes stopping at "roadhouses" for dinner and drinks. Choctaw County in those days was dry. There were no legal "roadhouses." Although there were no racial implications in the case, Brown chooses to inject race and the Klan to add stereotypical sensationlism, as if the case weren't sensational enough already. Then Brown goes on to add a brief history of racial violence and the civil rights movement in Birmingham, a city over 100 miles away. The names of persons in the book are sometimes clumsy variations of the real names. To someone familiar with the area and facts of the real case, this book is a confused mishmash.
1,This was NOT truly a mystery in the vein of Agatha Christie as I was lead to believe! It was more a synopsis of	WW I and the people involved with the war and its aftermath.
1,Expatriates: A Novel of the Coming Global Collapse is by far and away the worst of Mr. Rawles' books. I purchased a hard copy as well as the Kindle edition. I really wanted it to be a turn around novel for James as his first book was so very good. I was barely able to finish the book but did so out of respect for Capt. Rawles and hoping  that the story  would soon engage, but that never happened.
1,I good and fascinating story but told in such a verbose style I often thought I was digging through a book by Dickens...and no that is NOT meant as a compliment.  If the style was as clear of rubbish as the cover it could be a really good read.
1,I loved "The Shack".  Not do much with this book.
1,Boring and served the purpose for class.
1,It was not one of the best written books I've ever read.  However, I finished it although the story was to me somewhat lacking in originality.
1,I bought this book without really reading into it. First off, it is Jumbo. Second, songs are not "Easy". Third, of all the 200 songs (I haven't really counted), I would challenge anyone to find more than 10 songs that anyone would want to play. They are just hideous and so this book becomes a paperweight. Like I said, I did not do my due diligence and really look into what the songs were... I just got caught up on the two main words in the title, Jumbo and Easy.
1,First, be aware for some spoilers, second I never knew in a thousand years I will said something like the word bad for a  Kristen Ashley's book, but I'm appalled and disappointed, and even hurts (no drama).		Knight our hero is not a hero and is not a knight is a pimp,  yes you read well!! which doesn't make sense first and foremost because his mother was a prostitute and he suffered through his early life because of this but anyways he got a prostitution business that not matter how hard kristen tried, not even her with her goddess written style and expertise was able to  pull it off and make it look good, plain and simple wrong and a turn off, he is a badass of all badasses but for God sake, the deepest sentence he ever pronounced : Jesus f**k and only when he was emotionally overwhelmed, because the rest of the time he doesn't even worry about to finish sentences. And our heroine, she is just that dirty old doormat we have in the front door and everybody step on it . I know kind of crazy right!! he could say he was murder and a terrorist and the only reaction from her would be accepting and daddy I love you ( another turn off) but I honestly don't want to give up in my girl KA, and maybe i read Creed the next one on the series I might or might not. God not even the sex was something worth to read!!
1,Boring
1,Mostly a story about drug addiction with some cooking thrown in. Relies on shock value and interest in celeb chefs.
1,Expensive teaser
1,The only reason I gave this two stars is because I was able to finish it.  One star ratings are reserved for books that I can't get through.  You may like this book.  It received some pretty decent reviews from others, but I really don't have anything nice to say about it.
1,The story concept was really great. There were certain aspects of this book that were top rate but I think the author tried to do too much and ended up dropping the ball when it counted. There are a lot of strings left dangling by the end. I understand you need to leave mystery for future books but there were many things that were left unfinished that could have improved the quality of the book had she tied them up.	I borrowed with with Amazon Prime and returned it before I thought to check but there were A LOT of swear words, which I don't always have a problem with as long as they are well placed and mean something. At the end I thought I was going to scream if she wrote "He gave the F-bomb a work out" one more time.	The writer also used a lot of unnecessary acronyms like LZ for "Landing Zone" I wish she would have just said landing zone.	The fight scenes were good but players in the scene would go MIA. One minute you were reading about how character a was doing X to character b and then all of a sudden she is talking about something else and never tells you what happened because of the previous action.	All in all, for $3.99 I guess the book is a descent buy and I will probably read the others but only with the borrow option of Amazon Prime. I can think of many other books to spend my money on.
1,It annoys me when an author is capable of writing a description good enough to entice me to read their book, but then the actual story falls flat. There was nothing enjoyable about this book. It was totally predictable and I kept wondering if the author bothered to to any actual BDSM research or just gathered it from other books she read. No discussions prior to play about limits? Afterwords were never even mentioned. The main character is gagged in front of a room full of people with no way to signal if she's in distress, and he ignored her completely when she told him she was not an exhibitionist. Totally disappointing.
1,just not my type of book  don't know what I expected but this was not it others may enjoy though
1,This is more a response to kindle books than this cookbook.  There is no index for this edition on kindle, which means that if you want to prepare a recipe using a specific ingredient, say beef or chicken, as far as I know, you have to do a lengthy key word search.  All kindle books should include indices, without them the bonuses of kindle format are  at least questionable.  Please at least provide chapter headings for quick reference.
1,I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. I can't believe how naive the heroine is. I can't believe she married Sebastian without Knowing anything anything about him. This reads like a cheap romance book. Part of the problem is that for someone who finished college, lived in Paris, was a veterinarian, she acted like an inexperience teenager with her first crush. I am reading this book as part of a book club selection by one of our group.
1,Too weird for my taste. The characters were not believable, and I was bored reading this. Maybe better for young people.
1,just awful compared to his adult books. if that's what you are looking for you will be disappointed. like a totally different author.
1,I have been a Jackson fan for quite some time and I have to say this book was the worst! The storyline was rushed and underdeveloped.  Could have been a good book but.....
1,I loved Empire and Elude. I loved Sergio. They were two of my favorite mafia books. I did not enjoy this book. Dante and El's relationship was boring. Easy book to put down. Having a hard time believing the same author wrote this book. It was a struggle to finish the book. Will pass on the next one.
1,Rotten
1,I've got two toddlers and like to think I've seen a decent number of good kid's books.  You can usually pick out what element of social or academic education they are going for.  And to me, the best ones are the ones whose whole purpose is to educate (for this level of reading).  But this always seems like an after-thought, or even a never-thought for this author. I'm not really sure what take-away my kids are suppose to leave with.		The book is about PInkalicious on a soccer team, playing against some "mean girls" (in black of course) who don't like pink.  This distracts Pinkalicious, so she doesn't play well.  But when it matters, Goldalicious sweeps her away and she visits a bunch of random countries and plays soccer with different people.  My favorite line is when she tells Goldalicious to take her home..."I know what I have to do."  She then comes back and scores the winning goal.  The response from the mean girls that she just beat is that they cheer for her and change their minds about the color pink.		What's the moral?  Imagine you are other places where people like what you like and then beat the kids who are mean to you and they'll like you?		I'm probably being over-critical, but...really didn't like this book (or any of the Pinkalicious series).  I think there are better ones out there.
1,Almost immediately upon Michael Jackson's death, this "Rabbi," who touts his Oxford connection but who was actually BANNED from Oxford, and who, along with his wife, was found guilty of misappropriating funds from one of his "charities" and diverting the money for personal use, came out with "The Michael Jackson Tapes," a distorted and horrendous betrayal of trust.  He waited until AFTER Jackson died and then this "man of God" told us that Michael Jackson WANTED him to reveal his private thoughts in such a book.  He skewered Jackson, said he would watch his own children "very carefully" when they were around Jackson, was UNWILLING to say that Jackson wasn't guilty of the molestation allegations (he wasn't sure whether he was or he wasn't), and then had the gall to dedicate that book to Jackson's children.  To be fair, he did warn us that he was going to make a SECOND money grab with another book about Michael Jackson's feelings about children.  He suggested that Jackson was a tragic figure who should have just been quietly buried and forgotten about, his life to be remembered only to serve as a "warning" for the rest of us.  He complained publicly that Jackson was being deified after death.  Boteach wrongly assumed that because Jackson was so badly bullied for the last 16 years of his life, the bullying would only continue and he was going to cash in by joining the Jackson-bashing party.		Then a funny thing happened.  The truth about Michael Jackson finally began to emerge, and, as one TV journalist put it, "The more we learn about Michael Jackson, the nobler he seems."  The tide turned, as many people realized the great injutice that had been done to this great man.  Boteach realized that no one wanted to hear his distorted garbage about Michael Jackson any more.  It was all the rage to trash Jackson before, but it was no longer popular or profitable to do so, and this Rabbi very much wants to be popular and profitable.  So he ditched his second attack manuscript and rewrote the entire thing, this time telling us that he doesn't believe Michael was guilty of the allegations against him.  What changed?  Nothing but public sentiment, and Boteach's publisher telling him he needed to write a different book because popular opinion about Jackson had shifted.  So the "Rabbi" obliged:  clearly sales would be much better if he wrote a positive book rather than the second negative book he had planned.		This second book is still full of the disgraced and self-seeking Rabbi's hot air and preachiness, and, based on his impoverished character, I cannot trust a word he says about Jackson.  I certainly do not trust his judgment, his analytical skills, or any of his interpretations of Jackson's thoughts, feelings, or actions.  Don't waste your money on yet another piece of garbage.		Stay tuned.  He's probably planning to release the actual tapes next to further buttress his bank accounts -- edited, of course, to flatter himself.
1,"Aunt Allie" was a dead-honest original, and didn't deserve to have Frank Waters misuse the authority of her name to unload on an unsuspecting public this duplicitous melange of lies about her life, especially that part lived with the Earps.		 Allie denounced this book in her own inimitable profane manner. In my possession are the letters of Hildreth Halliwell, Aunt Allie's grand niece, saying only that Allie threatened to "sue" Waters. (She actually threatened to kill him.) As Hildreth went on to say, "I get so mad every time I think of what Frank Waters wrote after spending hours with Aunt Allie I go berserk . . . he published a lot of lies . . . "		I make that clear in my Epilogue to I MARRIED WYATT EARP and did on two other occasions while Waters was still alive, thus giving him an opportunity to sue me for libel if he chose. Naturally he didn't.		Before Frank realized what I knew for sure, I visited him when he was writer-in-residence at Colorado State U. at Ft. Collins, in 1966, ten years before my I MARRIED WYATT EARP was published. I asked him what Aunt Allie had said about his book. He said, "She said it was the truth." I still have extensive notes from that meeting." He naturally said that, but it wasn't true, of course.		This book certainly is a "travesty" as Bruce Trinque comments in an adjoining review, and it is far worse than that. Of course Bruce is referring to Frank Waters' initial title, TOMBSTONE TRAVESTY. Travesty is mild, however, this book is an outrage. It is my opinion that principle requires that it no longer be published.		In sum, Waters' book is garbage, although many passages are pure gold. The book's value is as a source for the more knowledgeable to attempt to separate the gold from the garbage. It certainly is a curiosity. But it isn't a dependable memoir.
1,When will crime novelists finally tire of the "genius killer" cliche? This author can hardly mask his true sadist, abhorrent nature. This kind of book should come with a warning: do not read if you don't want the writer to inflict his sick fantasies on you.
1,I'm a huge fan and pre-ordered this book based on my love of previous Carl Hiaasen books and what I thought was a can't miss premise.  Unfortunately, I was wrong.		The thing I loved about the author's previous novels was that even though the characters were bizarre - they had a depth and an underlying humanity that made them vibrant.  That is completely lacking in this book.  Even the 'cameo' characters from previous books seem like caricatures of themselves.		Overall, I found myself grinding through pages to get to the thrown together finale.  I also thought that the epilogue was perfunctory.		Here's hoping that Mr. Hiaasen can rediscover some of the magic that made him one of my favorite authors in the past.
1,Not a great story did not read all of book couldn't get pass first chapter
1,Like most of the LP books now they are just insipid and to mainstream. I find more interesting places - rooms eateries and spots myself where you are not swamped with people on the LP trail. It is such bib biz now it almost sculpts the travelers mind and way of thinking. I prefer the days when you went from London to Delhi without a scrap of info except from the people you meet. I took five months doing the cape town too Addis trail without a book. Brilliant. LP  still good for a map or room.
1,Argh! This book makes me angry!		His Dark Materials started off as a promising tale in The Golden Compass. I liked Lyra, liked Iorek, found Mrs. Coulter fairly creepy, and in general enjoyed the world created by Mr. Pullman.		I became nervous in The Subtle Knife, because Lyra lost some centrality in the narrative for the (in my opinion) less interesting Will... the other characters I'd grew fond of only came in sporadically, and weren't presented as well as before... and also because the story had a rapidly expanding scope that I was worried the author might not be able to handle (what with travel between the dimensions, and a war against "the Authority," et cetera). But, I maintained hope, knowing that middle volumes often feel like there's something missing. I trusted that things would come together in the end.		I couldn't have been more wrong. Far from coming together, the narrative swings wildly out of control, until it winds up without a coherent plot, sympathetic characters, a sensible theme, or anything really to salvage it from disaster.		By this third volume, Lyra's world has been completely left behind, as has Citagazze, and Earth, and we are left in realms that seem desolate, and devoid of interest. Characters we've cared for before come on as cameos, but not truly as themselves, and leave quickly. Instead of even developing strong new characters, we're just given eccentric alien races that seem to have personalities imprinted on them by virtue of the "species" they happen to be; none of them are worth a damn, or elicit a moment's sympathy. The 'Mulefa' -- Pullman's Ewoks -- are ridiculous in their conception and offer nothing whatever to the narrative, except that they give Pullman a chance to inject more strangeness, which seems to be a premium to him. Possibly worse are the Lilliputians, I mean Gallevespians, I mean Lilliputians, and yes I get it, Pullman -- they're a very proud and fierce people; I promise to remember that, if you stop repeating it every other paragraph. Maybe worse than the Lilli...Gallevespians are the Harpies, who combine the "species is my identity" concept with Pullman's special genius for dramatic, senseless character change.		Iorek ambles into the story for no reason other than to remind readers that yes, this story has something to do with The Golden Compass, and by the time he ambles back out I wonder why I ever cared about him to begin with. Mrs. Coulter is absolutely destroyed -- it's as though she never had a character at all, and so Pullman feels free to make her say anything, do anything, without damage. Lyra, too, becomes a mere poppet, doomed to the most cliched and unrealistic description of love I've ever yet read (including a Danielle Steel novel)!		The war against the Authority was never well-developed in this story, and so it's fitting that the ending should be so inconclusive and muddled. Who won? Who lost? Who can tell? Who cares? The plot events leading up to the ending are contrived and borderline non-sensical. I understand that, generally, it's unwise to try to read too much sense into fantasy epics, but still... Alright, so Pullman's world subscribes to the nigh-infinite dimensions theory, that every choice spawns a universe going in either direction, or something absurd like that. Fine. Then, are we given to believe that there is only one (say) Roger? Or one Lyra? Or are there infinite-many, as seems to be suggested by the dimensional theory? Lyra's world lacks cars, or any number of basic technological advances (as seems to make sense), but can devise a bomb that can detonate hair, trans-dimensionally, just by having a sample on hand...? Actually, what this bomb really does is blow up any vestige of suspension of disbelief. Lyra and her daemon can't willingly separate (it's a hard and fast rule in this universe) until they can, and with little ill effect. The author has no respect for any rules, natural, supernatural, or even those of his own devise.		Speaking of respect, the author also has no respect for the reader -- that the reader might reach his own conclusions about anything -- and instructs us on how we're supposed to feel about things by repeating them endlessly. Lyra's method of "defeating death," in allowing the spirits of the departed to "become one with everything" and essentially ceasing to exist, or whatever, is good. How do we know? Because Pullman continually tells us how it leaves Lyra feeling good, or how the dissolving souls look happy, and so on.		Argh!		I could go on, and probably for a while, but what's the point? I was hoping for more -- much more -- from this series. The first book was pretty good. Never brilliant, but pretty good, and that's usually enough. Overall, there was a chance for something special, but it's all dissolved, thrown away, and mocked in this final volume.		It's as though a Specter has drained the life from the husk of what was once The Golden Compass, and has returned this tedious final entry, without fun, hope, or life.
1,Although the storyline and concept was good the story was shallow and transparent. This is the second book I have read from this author and the writing is good quality, great structure but although not completely juvenile, it lacked depth and maturity.	It started out well and was a lot stronger than a lot of samples I have read lately. I think books of this genre should be a little like Disney films - all ages can get something out of it even if it intended for a young audience. To me the main characters friends were a little silly.	It has not put me off this author as the talent is very evident.
1,Did like it
1,Rather boaring...
1,Hard to believe story.
1,"MURKY"? So the language of the 2nd amendment is "murky"? How can the SCOTUS rule abortion is a right but gun ownership isn't when it has its own amendment specifically stated?	"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed" These words can be argued all day long with the likes of Justice Stevens but the argument should always end with the words "the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed" Stare Decicis
1,I enjoy Jodi Picoult's books. However, this book drug on for me. Not only that but I knew 1/2 way through what was going to happen. Of course I read it and honestly it's better than some, but for all the acclaim that has been bestowed upon it..I am not exactly sure why. The Plain Truth is better.
1,It's poorly written and clearly is a wannabe bestseller-thriller going by the numbers. Everyone is wealthy, everyone has things, but no one has a face, or the color of a shirt or lives in anywhere that isn't fabulous, but undescribed. And, it's bull-pucky.
1,So, I bought this book hoping to learn more about After Effects 6.  I read the one review, and thought great.  Boy, was I wrong!		In the two chapters I've read so far, I've encountered crippling errors.  Let me give you an example.  In Chapter two, the author refers to a project file.  Doesn't really tell you where to find it (his arrogance is that you must find it on your own, or you don't belong reading his tome, apparently).  Once you waste your time finding it (I'm sorry, why did I have to waste my time finding it????), and open it, he refers to a portion of that project that he wants you  to open.  AGAIN, he doesn't specify what file to open.  You're supposed to find it, or guess, I suppose.  This is on Page 43, Chapter two.  So, you look and you look on the DVD and there is a file called bouncing ball (actually there are several), but magicially  on Page 44, if you look at Figure 2.4, "bouncing ball" is actually "basketball".  The only problem is that the the videos of "bouncing ball" shows what is obviously a "soccer ball".  So, you think you have the wrong file, see?  But after searching over and over, you realize this is just very sloppy writing and editing, and that you might have the right file after all.  Of course, it appears to be beneath this grand author to actually tell you what file to open in the first place, but you've already spent the money, so what does he care?		Another example:  on Page 47, he discussed a fairly advanced feature of the Graph Editor, Separate Dimensions.  He explains that this feature has options that even advanced editors miss.  So, what does he do?  On Page 47, he instructs you to disable the Graph Editor Set for the Y Position, but again does not tell you how to do that.  Again, you're supposed to figure it out.  Or guess.  Or throw his poorly written book in the toilet.  If you're not advanced enough to find this option, well, you're just stupid, I guess.		Many of the graphics in this book are completely unreadable.  Especially those that show After Effects workspaces.  They're extremely tiny, blurry (even with a magnifying glass!) and unreadable, making them useless.		And on and on and on it goes....		God, if I could only get my money back!!!
1,This publisher is from another planet.  The Kindle version changes price every day!  And it gets higher and higher...  You can buy this book in hardcover at discount stores for less than the Kindle electronic price.  This makes no sense.
1,It is not my kind of favorite bookl.	There are too many words and phrases that are hard for me to digest.	Not very entertaining.
1,I expected this to be more adult it looks like a kindergarten coloring book.
1,Monotonous scenes of violence as they flee from the Conglomerates. Not really sure why I finished it. The language was not always the best. Would have been much happier without the sexual entendres or sex scene.
1,I was hoping this book was more basic "dot to dot" with wider application to various quilting methods.  It is too long-arm oriented and too traditional for my taste.  Also, only a few introductory pages are actually dot to dot.  The rest of the book is just traditional quilting motifs with little guidance how to create them.
1,I enjoy a good read, especially one that the characters in the story move along with their words & dialogue. I read 79 pages into this Pulitzer Prize winner and had no idea "what" was going on. Lots of flowery description, but, frankly, boring. Sorry.
1,This book sucks.  There are no interesting stories.  Artie is a washed up hack.  I liked his first book, but this is a product designed to fleece what remains of his fans.  Sorry Artie, you suck. WAHHHHH!
1,Others have hinted at it, I'll call a spade a spade.  This is absolute trash.  What a disservice is done by this idiot even daring to "recite" any of these so-called classics, and the fact that she proclaims any degree of influence from Oscar Wilde is absolutely mind boggling.  Clearly she's trying to seek some type of affirmation by equating herself with an individual of that caliber, or perhaps align herself with hopeless throngs of Morrissey and Ex-Smiths fanatics (admittedly I include myself in that group).		To then switch to the "modernists"...I can't even find the words to address this travesty.  I'm not a poet, and never claimed to be, so perhaps my lack of words is of no consequence.  But should you desire exposure to anything of the "modern" ilk, do yourself a favor and go get ANYTHING by Charles Bukowski, ANYTHING by John Fante, or go get any Tom Waits record from 1973 to 1988.
1,this could have been a good series. Sadly ruined by a lot of profanity ....which was unnecessary. Sadly I bought the other three books thinking they would be good due to other reviews. I deleted them all!
1,While there are a couple of great models in this tiny book, the laughably bad and inadequate diagrams make it a waste of your money.		Seriously, the diagrams are bad. In Stamm's Dragon (#18) there's a couple of steps where the diagrams are just flat out incorrect. If you look ahead a few steps you can see what you are supposed to accomplish, but it doesn't match the diagrams in the previous steps at all. And in the steps for JuliAnn's Dragon, there are some complicated folds that are just glossed over, and one sink fold that is missing a callout...a callout that is shown in the same step/fold for Natasha's Flapping Dragon. What garbage. If they author can't bother to proof-read and edit his own work, then why should you pay for it?		The author goes on in the introduction about their drafting and cartography experience. That experience does not show through here.
1,I love the concept of read alongs and my 2-1/2 year old son loves it too.  A chime sounds so he knows when to turn the page.  This Winnie the Pooh book is just wordy and not interesting.  It is as if they are cramming 8 plots into one story and it is all over the place.  Oddly, my toddler still likes it, but I don't.
1,As trained scientist and psychologist, I didn't like the book.	Cain takes a little bit of scientific evidence and builds upon it her personal theory which is only her personal opinion and not 100% scientifically correct. She puts people in two distinct categories: introversion/ extroversion, but doesn't notice that this trait, as all others, are distributed on Gauss curve. This means that most of people are ambiverts (the category that she doesn't even mention) and have characteristics from both introversion and extroversion. Also, she takes other traits and psychological constructs, and says that reason why people differ on this psychological constructs is introversion/extroversion. In other words, according to her, everything is caused by introversion/extroversion. At the end of book, she does say that her definition of introversion/extroversion is not scientific one. But then, I don't understand why did she talked to scientists and described their data. I think she had a good idea, but she does not have enough psychological knowledge to write this kind of book. As someone already said, this could be very good 20 p newspaper article, but this turned in a book where she tried to turn all data in here advantage even if they don't prove her point.	What I did like in that book is the message that we should respect our differences and not to try to make everybody the same. Our differences should be our strength.
1,This rating is based solely on one issue.  Smack in the middle of the book is a very explicit sex scene.  This was very disappointing because up until that point, I found the writing style flowed well, being easy to read yet intelligent, and the setting was new and engaging to me.  I gained some insight into the world of football from a female person's perspective. After the sex scene, the book continued in the same manner in which it had started.  Which led me to question why the sex scene was included in such an explicit, blow by blow, as it were, manner.  Just to make the book more "commercial". And one other thing I didn't think flowed well was the injection of the "F" word.  It only showed up in regard to the player's speech.  Most people I know don't speak this way, so I wonder if this is as commonplace as we are led to believe.  Even though I very much enjoyed the style of this author, I will NOT purse the other books in this series strictly due to the sex scene.
1,too heavy
1,I read through these 4 volumes 33 years ago when I came to England because many of my fellow students raved about them.		The Hobbit is mildly amusing story suitable for children.		The LOTR is rather dreary boring tale which requires a lot of perseverence to complete. I have not re-read it since unlike other novels that I have re-read multiple times purely because a good work of literature improves on re-reading.		If you want to read a true epic with complicated human characters try reading a retelling of the Mahabharata.
1,This is one of the most disappointing books I have ever read.  To me the plot is unbelievable (nothing but excessive drugs, drinking, and sex)  It has no redeeming social value.  I have not seen the movie and do not wish to.  I can not say anything good about this book.
1,I read about 35% of this book and then checked to see if I could return it as it was just tiresome to me.  I wanted a mystery, I didn't want to know so much about everyone's feelings to the exclusion of the actual murder.  Oh Me!  I realize there are many fans and perhaps I should have tried an earlier book when Montalbano may have had less angst.  I was also excited about the possibility of seeing the videos of these stories.  The book cured me of this idea.
1,Required for nursing school. This book was not very helpful and I could have easily done well in the course without this.
1,I returned the book because it was just too basic. Not a bad book, just not the right book for me.
1,I have used these cards with my child clients to help them deal with stress and anger.  The cards are very well drawn pictures.  However most of my kids do not care for the activities on these cards and would not want to do them.. The activities are not very practical and I think the priced was too much never mind the cost of shipping
1,I wanted to like this book due to its popularity and award winning description. I forced myself through the first few chapters despite the tedious writing style. I eventually gave up. The plot was too slow and morbid and the writing style was difficult to plod through. I really don't understand why it received the praise it did.
1,NOT SIZE advertised. The one I received was approximately 5"x6"  thus VERY HARD/ Impossible to read.
1,I could only get to 88% on my Kindle because every time the main character littered, it made me want to slap her through the Kindle screen. If people flicking their cigarette butts all over the ground and being a litterbug bothers you, this is not the book for you!
1,Since I've enjoyed the prequel novella, I had high hopes for this book, which, in hindsight, were probably unfounded. While I had no trouble ignoring anachronisms in&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Viscount-s-Christmas-Temptation-Dukes-of-War-Book-0/dp/B00OR549DS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Viscount's Christmas Temptation (Dukes of War Book 0)</a>, in this story they just didn't work for me.  Spoilers ahead.		How did the heroine, an American, whose grandparents were in trade, manage to get invitations to exclusive balls without an appropriate sponsor or chaperone? If her grandparents wanted her to find a husband on the Marriage Mart, why did they not arrange for proper introductions? They were willing to splurge on the wardrobe, but didn't care about her reputation?		What about the hero's inheritance or, rather his startling discovery that he had none? How did an earl coming into the title manage to miss that he was destitute? At the late earl's death, the estate would have gone through probate, giving the heir a complete accounting of his financial position, or indebtedness as the case was in this story. His having to travel to the bank to find out that he had no assets save the entailed ancestral pile and title was utterly implausible.		Now, you might wonder about the central conflict of the story. The heroine intended to get married to get access to the dowry the grandparents had settled on her and return to America, dropping her husband like a hot potato, so she could take care of her sick mother. Oddly enough, no one took the time to explain to her the absurdity of such idea - if in fact she was ignorant of the matter - that upon her marriage, all her property would legally become her husband's and, in the eyes of the law, she would cease to exist as a separate entity. Basically, she wouldn't be able to touch any of that money or leave the country without her husband's permission. Did someone say, "Oops?"		Considering the story was only a hundred and fifty pages long, even if the plot hadn't been such a contrived mess, sheer word count worked against the story: there simply wasn't enough room to fully flesh out the details. I think I'll pass on the rest of the series.
1,but I read the other reviews.  I could not make myself keep reading - the writing was stilted, the characters uninteresting and the story was plodding.  I looked down and realized 80% of the book remained.  Not for me, I deleted it and moved on.
1,I expected much more from this book than the author supplied.  The story line is completely unbelievable and riddled with errors that make it completely unrealistic.  Editing is mediocre.
1,Not as many tips as I had hoped for.
