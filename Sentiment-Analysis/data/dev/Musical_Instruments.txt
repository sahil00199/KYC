0,PROS:	*Price!	*UHF!	*Range - transmitted through 2 walls		CONS:	*Can't think of any so far. The build quality seems solid but the unit feels a little light. That is a product of the perception that 'heavier is better' for these types of things so it's not really a con.		I bought this to use with my band. I haven't used the mics that came with because I wanted something less bulky on my head so I bought the	Pyle PMEMSN12 Ear-Hanging Wired Boom Microphone for $25.		My band is an Irish music band. Sometimes we play 2, 3 or even 4 hour shows with multiple sets. I keep a tablet on stage with my setlist, lyrics and chords because there's no way I can remember 80 songs. This means I occasionally glance down to look where I am in the song and if I'm using a mic on a stand that means I get off phase. So I decided to get a wireless headset system. There are a ton to choose from and they can get expensive. I'm not a pro. This is my hobby and I'm no opera singer by any stretch of the imagination so the $300+ systems seem like a bit of overkill.		Pyle equipment seems to be well reviewed so I decided to try. For $80 for the system + a $25 mic, I was only into it for $105. And I have been pleasantly surprised. It works just fine for what I'm doing. The range is fine, no static, 8 channels... what more to say? It does the job.		It probably won't work at 100 yards nor will pick up every frequency in the human hearing range, but if you're expecting an $80 system to do that you have both an abundance of hope and most likely a lot of disappointment.		What this WILL do is be a solid option for meat-and-potatoes bar band singer without straining the ol' wallet.		4 stars. Solid performer for the bucks.
0,This was an anonymmous gift to the local high school jazz band.
0,Works very well but have had a few to go bad over the years. Warranty is kind of a joke so don't mess with it, just order new one.
0,These Elixir Nanoweb acoustic strings went on a Takamine Santa Fe model, one of my pride-and-joy guitars; the tone was superb, a mellow ringing that shimmered more like bells rather than twang like plucked wires! I am also happy to report that even after two months with them on, although the strings have lost some of their shimmering newness, they still open up the guitar's voice appropriately. These have become my go-to strings for the Takamine from now on!
0,works well as monitor amp
0,I have read many great reviews from amateur musicians and band members about  Hohner Special Twenty Harmonicas,and to have the perfect set of 5(minus the F) at this price was a great offer. I love the tone,the durability of the reeds,the full clear range of these fine instruments. I play these in two separate bands and they truly add great accompaniment to any instrument. At other music stores,they can be quite a cost but this set is fabulous. The case is very well made,lightweight,and very protective. Well padded nice material protects my well loved fine tuned harps. I highly recommend this fine set to anyone.
0,Good size/# of keys for the casual musician.  Keyboard feel is acceptable.  Only nit is that the included music transcription software is terribly clunky and hard to use.  Spent a little to get a "lite" version of a competing software product and am much happier with that.
0,I like these Drumtacs, easy to place on the set and cymbals too.
0,product was as advertised and very prompt delivery.
0,This is the first Mooer pedal I've purchased, and the only noise suppressor/gate I've ever used. For how cheap it is, it's absolutely worth it.		During shows, one of two things would happen. We would be playing, and then there'd be a break in the song where everything drops out. Except instead of silence, you'd here the ridiculous static hum from my amplifier set up. It was extremely noisy. The other option was the song would be over, and a few seconds afterwards you'd hear radio frequencies coming through my amplifier loud and clear, boosted by my compressor pedal.		I hated dancing around to try and turn my distortion and compression off, then back on during every single stop and start during the set. This pedal absolutely fixed the problem. I set the threshold around negative 40 and can leave it all night if I want. At that level, it never really messes up my sustain and always cuts out the fuzz. The only reason I gave it four stars was because I felt like just a tiny, tiny bit of life left my tone when I activated the circuit. But it might be just because I'm used to hearing the fuzz inbetween notes when I play, compared to a completely naked cut off. So this might not be a problem with the pedal, but a problem I personally have with noise gates/suppressors.		If you're wondering, my rig set up is as follows -		Gibson Studio Les Paul Swamp Ash	Orange Rockerverb 50 Watt	Orange 2x12 closed back cab		Pedal Chain - Turbo Tuner by Sonic, Keeley 4 knob compressor, and either the Mooer Noise Killer or a vintage TS 808 to end my small chain, depending on the set. All cables are Livewire Elites. The chain is powered by a Voodoo Lab ISO-5.
0,works ok but the tightening bolt has worn away after 6 months of use. its cheap so you get what you pay for it
0,Great useful case.  Wish it was double the size!
0,Sweet sounding, smooth to play. I'm a brand new player and I love this harmonica. It has a very solid construction, nothing cheap-o about it. 4 philips head screws so you can change your reeds as needed, very wide output air ports, and nice finger indents for a secure grip.		I thought the number 2 inhale reed was messed up, but watching a Youtube video about this confirmed that it was my technique, nothing wrong with the harmonica. I followed the guide on Youtube and corrected this issue very easily.		Now comes the practice!		Thanks from Chicago
0,Great strings  !
0,sturdy foot stool.
0,I have the midi  to USB units from Ediro and E-MU which I paid a lot more than this generic midi to USB device. THis generic device seems to work as good; no problems thus far.
0,The price of this preamp was in the range that the band could afford and it lives up to that price range. We didn't expect it to sound like a thousand dollar mic-preamp thus we are really happy with it. I needed a mic-preamp that had phase reverse on it and this does the trick. I play in the band but am also the sound guy and the compressor on this comes in really handy when a guest singer comes up as I can hit the button and not worry so much about the output signal being overloaded. It's made my life easier setting up sound and I will start using it for recording in a few weeks when we start working on a new demo for the band. I think the trick with this preamp is to keep the input at the right place and then one can turn up the output to where they need it. I have to say it drives me nuts when reviewers will say something along the lines of "it's not a pro mic-preamp", well no, at this price would one really think it is? I mean those of us that can only afford so much, need it right away and can work with it to make it sound the best it can are really happy with it. In my musical life I have worked with excellent top of the line gear and worked with really bad gear, one can get decent sound out of just about anything if you work at it.
0,good
0,When I purchased my Breedlove Atlas Concert guitar, it came strung with D'Addarios. These sound great, very bright with great mid and bass tones. Even better that they came in a 3 pack. Most of these are $10-15 per set, so this is a great deal.
0,Great product. Much  heavier then I thought. Seem like very good quality at a price.  Wont  hesitate  To buy again.
0,The unit assembled in about 6 minutes, even for a klutz like me, hangs nicely on a microphone stand. After some initial resistance, it allowed the iPad entry, and holds it securely and with a nice range of tilt and rotation. Just don't turn the open end downward. (Oh, REALLY? :) ) Five stars for doing one thing and doing it well. Compared to some other iPad stands, it's quite a bit less expensive, nicely designed and effective. Good job, IK.
0,This little gem helped me split a source into two sources on my Yamaha Drum kit. The size is perfect.
0,This is a great product for amateurs like myself. You don't have to spend a fortune for on this great little mixer. My other choice was a Behringer, which also makes good mixers. The equivalent model was at least $40 more. The effects are great. Though in the picture the body looks like a cheap plastic fitting, it is actually quite solid. The USB recording is almost noiseless.		One small complaint I have, is the external power supply. They could have easily fitted the power supply within the unit itself making it even more portable.
0,the only strings I use on my semi hollow body
0,Lasts a good while, solid pedal.
0,I liked these picks pretty well. The ergonomics fit me kinda odd, but very solid little pick!
0,I have a SNARK tuner but was asked by the vendor to check out this Tidal Tek 3-1 tuner, tone gen, and metronome. The company sent a promotional sample for evaluation without promise of a review.		First and foremost - it works. It's small, clips easily, and can be maneuvered to the angle in which you need. You will want to check out the instructions since this isn't just a tuner. The power button allows the user to cycle through settings and features.  Let's take one at a time:		Tuner - not as responsive as SNARK, but it works just fine.  I'm talking about a 2-second delay to register the vibration, then you can tune...so it isn't a game changer.		Metronome - luckily you can go sans audio (LED lights).  The digital chirp is not what I'd call pleasing to the ear. The cool thing - you can dial this in between 30-250 bpm and select different rhythms.  By default it will be a loud chirp, then you can select medium, low, and off (LED only).		Tone generator - if you need one, cool.  It is the digital tone from hell. It is adjustable, though. So you may find this quite handy.		Overall, I like it. I'm posting this, then adding a few photos which will be below or to the left (depending on viewing device).  4.5/5 Stars.  Solid features and easy to use.
0,as stated
0,These are the only strings my sons love and use most.  We go through oodles.  Great price, great strings!
0,Just started getting back into guitar playing. This cord worked fine, no problems with this one.
0,I almost always play finger style without a pick, but on the occasion I need a pick I like these.		Easier to strum sounds good to me.		If you're doing a lot of picking out individual strings, you'll probably want something thicker, but these make it really easy to strum chords and sound good, plus pick out a few strings here and there.
0,STRUM AND SEE ALL NOTES... that's the only unique thing about this tuner, and thats the only reason you need to click on that BUY NOW button!
0,These strings sound really really different from all other strings I have tried. Depending on what you are looking for this is good or bad but for my application I am liking it. The strings are brighter and to me have sort of an old timey tone on my funky old Kay parlor guitar. The other thing is these sets from Ernie Ball are lighter gauge in the middle strings which makes it way easier to bend, but a bit heavier than normal on the low strings so you have beef in the lows. The only other strings I have found with this particular set of gauges are Curt Mangan. I am using the extra light set for easy bending, most manufacturers third and fourth string are 23-30, these are 20-28 which makes bends a breeze in comparison. When you take the strings out of the package they are a distinctly different color than most bronze strings I have personally tried. To be fair most of the other strings I have tried are phosphor bronze and these are 80/20. So maybe that is part of the difference? I am kind of new to acoustic guitar and I'm trying a lot of different string sets to figure out what works for me, so I don't have the most experience in the world with acoustic strings. With that grain of salt added this is my review and hope it is helpful to someone, thanks very much.
0,perfect for placing wireless microphones and power supply to make work easier
0,buy a 10 footer
0,Excellent,good price
0,These are the only strings I'll buy from now on, long lasting, loud and great sound! Hold their tone better than any other I've tried.
0,Perfect for my needs.
0,I bought 2 of these awesome mics but unfortunately one of them broke!!!  I was using the one that broke as a snare mic for my drum set, and I accidentally hit it with my drumstick and well, it's dead now.  I suggest using it in applications where you can use it more delicately because it's not an Sm57 for god sakes, but very very close in sound.
0,I love this setup. I am taking free lessons online and I am loving it! I have learned a ton in a couple of weeks. This kit has everything you need, I even received an extra guitar cable that I did not expect. I added a distortion pedal and now it rocks even better!
0,FINALLY! They made one that is simple and quick to use, sounds good and does not break the budget. Kudos!	Oh, and it is quite durable if not abused.
0,Cheap  but it does it's purpose.
0,It works as an overdrive pedal, a fuzz pedal, a distortion pedal... it pretty much does a little bit of everything, it's just unbelievable, I love it.
0,Thank you for these sticks, my son is 7 and is interested in learning to play drums, these will fit his structure much better than the regular sized sticks available, thank you
0,So I bought these because being Dunlop, I trust the brand. I don't even mind that they are sorta big and bulky. The only problem I have is, they scare the piss out of me. Its not a "tighten washer and nut" situation with what ive normally seen on strap locks. These have pegs that insert. Its so hard for me to trust these, I always have 1 hand gripped firmly on guitar even if just adjusting the amp I clench my guitar. So scared that the little metal balls things will just slip, peg fall out and ruin a $500 guitar. I havnet had a single problem with this system yet, and I never hope that I do. But if it happens there will be an update to this. Good product so far, just wouldn't recommend it. There is too much crap in the world to be worried about, strap locks shouldnt be one of those things.
0,Works
0,This is a clever idea for mounting a cowbell or other accessory to the bass drum hoop without damaging the hoop. The usual mount is like a vise that tightens on the hoop and can cause "hoop rash." This clamp attaches to the hoop like the bass drum tension rods and tightens with a drum key. It is very sturdy, and if the cowbell is removed, and the L rod is loosened and laid flat against the hoop, the clamp can remain permanently attached, unlike the usual mounts. The L rod has a small memory lock so it can be set back at the same angle every time.
0,Works for my GTR!
0,Look at the price on this. Save money and don't get any effects pedals yet. Get this first. It emulates other amps. There are no presets like you see elsewhere. You turn the knob to Black Panel, for example, or R-fier, and you get a particular amp emulation. It's up to you to add effects and tweak the equalizer, all of which the amp provides. There's a headphone jack in the back, and a jack for your smartphone in the top.
0,After the disappointment from buying the Hohner soft zippered case (a monster twice as big as any but the longest tremelo harps) I was leery about buying this but I took the chance and I am glad I did, my old favorite Special 20 fits snugly inside, not too tightly but firm enough to keep it from sliding and the case is thin enough to pocket easily yet padded just enough to protect my harp form the nicks and bangs of being carried.
0,As the saying goes, you get what you pay for. In this case, I got a cheap stand that will do the job.....until it eventually breaks.		Lot's of plastic parts at critical stress points on this stand (knobs, joints, etc). I'm sure they will fail sooner rather than later.		And what's up with the "counter balance" at the end of the boom? It's nothing more than a piece of plastic that has no function other than to "appear" like it has a function. It offers absolutely no additional weight at the end of the boom (well, technically it weighs "something," but not enough to be descernable).		I knew up front what I was getting. It will work as long as I don't abuse it. Seeing as how I do small gigs no more than once a week (for now), it should last a while considering the fact that I pretty much baby all of my equipment.		If you are the same way with your own equipment, then I would recommend the stand.
0,I did a lot of review reading here on Amazon as well as other sites to try to find a good value in a amp to drive a sound sytems for music and announcements in an outdoor setting. The PMP530M has proven to be a good choice. We drive two large dual 10inch speakers.  They get plenty of power from the amp and were able to fill the ramada area of our RC flying field with sound at half the volume setting.  I also got a cable to allow my MP3 player to use the aux input with the left and right RCA jacks.  (HOSA CMR210 from Amazon) The inputs have the expected controls on each channel and the aux input can be turned down for announcements without turning the MP3 player off.  My only complaint is the 100 FX choices are not labeled in the instructions, online or anywhere else I could find.  I have no idea what a 22 is or how it is different from a 51!  Seems pretty easy to fix and silly to omit. You'll have to work through all 100 to see how they impact the sound or what they are supposed to do.  Large hall, reverb, who knows?  The FX output has a intensity control but you still to figure out what they are.  That was my 1-star downgrade.  I have several Beheringer products.  All have been great.
0,Its a very nice looking strap and attaches to the gs mini well, but if i had it to do over i would get the all leather strap.  this one the guitar slides around and is hard to keep in place.  its a very nice strap and well made.
0,I put this on a 16" Italian accordion circa 1920 (very heavy box). It fits well and the width and thickness of the straps are from heaven.
0,An adapter that adapts like it's supposed to.
0,For $35 bucks you can't ask for more.  I'm using it with an old VHT tube amp and it does very well.  Understand that 4 stars are based on the price as well.  Its not going to sound like an ecstacy blue pedal.  But hey, it's $35 !  Sounds very "Voxy" if thats what you are into.
0,This case is a great value. The interior is padded in the right places. The exterior and latches all appear well made. I am very happy with this purchase.
0,I love balanced tensions strings, D'Addario makes a great basic set for a very reasonable price. Threw these babies on my Mexican P and feels equal parts fat and maneuverable.
0,First time I tried the encore 300 was when I sang with my church choir.  I was so impressed with the clarity and power of the mic that I bought one to use for my band I shelved my Shure Beta, AKG and Sennheiser mics.  I heard of Blue mics but they don't market their products all over. It is the best kept secret.  I highly recommend this product.  However, it uses phantom power.
0,I RECOMMEND
0,looks great. arrived quick
0,I bought my Akai MPX8 a couple of days ago. And it is everything I could have expected. The build quality is very solid. The pads are extremely comfortable if you do a lot of fingering with drum kits. The display is very clear and crisp. No problems with adjusting parameters. It is also a great midi controller, so feel free to use it with your music software. I'm really digging this sample launcher. It's very portable and can be set up almost anywhere. Pads light up in three cool colors, and can be programmed accordingly. I would definitely recommend to a friend. Very cool controller!
0,Works perfectly - plus the design is such that you need to clip to the uke neck. Works on vibrations through the neck - not through the "air" - as my guitar tuner does.  This is a great little deal and I would recommend - and some kind of tuner is needed for ukes - since they do not stay in tune worth a darn.  Might as well get this one.
0,I was putting together my first pedal board...WHAT A MESS!  Wires, wires, and, more wires...Until I found these. What a revelation!  Everything is much cleaner, much more professional looking, less "confusing",  and, using these gave me room to add another pedal.  They're built to last and are definitely the closest fitting couplers out there.
0,excellent barring
0,This is easy. There are not many win-win's in live, but with a great selection of weights combined with the fact that my kids loved the colors selection, i would highly recommend these to your guitar playing brood.
0,I purchased a grey-colored Zoom H1 complete with a recording kit (windscreen, case, mic adapter, etc) from B&H Photo for less than an H1 alone on Amazon. Very happy with the purchase.		The stereo mics on this recorder alone are worth the purchase. They are quality condenser mics. The fact that you also get a portable recorder is almost like a bonus.		However, the unit is a little bigger than I thought it'd be (calling this a "pocket recorder" is a stretch). But the mics are very sensitive and seem to have a pretty flat or "neutral" bias. Many reviewers have commented on handling noise. I can confirm that the unit will pick up a lot of rumbling if you're holding it with your hand and recording on the most sensitive setting. Also, many reviewers have commented on the cheap, plastic feel. I don't think it's as bad as many people have reported. It's about the same as a remote control on a quality TV, but not has bad as the cheap plastic on some toys. It's not slick or slippery, it has a little bit of a matte texture which provides grip, and I like the feel.		My last complaint is that the unit has auto-gain, but no limiter or compressor, and no noise gate. For a few extra bucks, I really would have liked to see these features built into the software/firmware.
0,look good work great
0,Although I didn't purchase my Snark SN-1 on Amazon, I wanted to share my excellent customer service experience with a company that clearly cares about its customers. I had a problem with my SN-1, and the company replaced it, no questions asked.		The SN-1 is a must-have as far as I'm concerned. I like the logical incremental LED display that shows if you're flat or sharp. Great, sturdy clip with a well thought-out foot pad works perfectly with my acoustic and electric. I usually just leave the tuner on my headstocks.		I did find what I think is a potential design flaw. The molded plastic fingers that create the socket for the ball joint can snap off if you're not careful. The rubber feet can fall off as well. As mentioned, the company replaced mine without any hassle, so I'd buy with confidence.
0,I see mixed reviews here.  At this price, no telling what the quality control is like but as I wrote in another review on this type of item, you can buy 3 of these and if one fails, you're still ahead of the game.  They're so much less expensive than what one will typically find in a guitar or electronics store, well worth taking a chance.  Mine seems to be fine, doesn't look or feel flimsy at all.  I can't see any difference between this and what I buy in a retail package.
0,This is a great guitar stand, but with one serious design flaw.  I'm glad in a way that the one I received had this flaw, and I found it before it was too late.		PROS:  The guitar hangs by the neck;  Stand is well built and sturdy		CON:  Design Flaw - The only thing preventing your Guitar from falling off the stand and crashing to the floor is one small screw.	The fix for this is to drill and put an additional screw to hold the guitar holder in place.
0,The Behringer HA400 4-Channel Stereo Headphone Amp came as ordered. No problems or suprises to report. Plugged it in and it works good.
0,A must have.
0,Polishes nicely and I have no fear that it will scratch or mar the varnish on my cello. Will buy again.
0,Good!
0,strong  instrument cable
0,Can't go wrong with the clear high and low ends of this pickup.
0,I have used several brands and gauges on my 3/4 size acoustic guitar and I like the way the feel and sound.
0,Excellent hangers.  Had no problem putting them up.  I needed 5 hangers for my collection, both electric and acoustic guitars.  I didn't like the bumper on the end but that was easy to remove and my guitars still feel secure on the hanger.
0,Superb quality as expected, if you're familiar with this brand then you know what it's all about, couldn't ask for more.		Thank you Amazon for selling professional music gear on your site.	I dread the thought of stopping in my local Guitar Center to buy anything.	Anyone that's had that experience knows what I'm talking about.	Received it in just a couple days in flawless condition right to my door.	No traveling around and haggling with vultures who work off of a commission.
0,It's light. It works, and it's inexpensive. Not much else to say about a guitar stand. For the money, it's a good deal
0,Excellent. I'm glad that I purchase them. Better than using my six foot cords. Much neater.
0,Great value . but u Will get random picks not the designs in the picture
0,I've been playing guitar for 15 years and I've had quite a few $1,000+ instruments. I've had the Makala MK-T for about 5 months and today, I went to guitar center to try out a few "upgrades". After playing on tenor ukes, ranging from $200 - $300, I feel that the Makala sounded just as good and played just as well. Of course, a good set of strings is half the battle, but still - the Makala MK-T is awesome!		If you're thinking about upgrading, wait until you can afford a high end ukulele and play them in person if you can.
0,I'm very happy with this amp. Great for use at home and strong punch if you know how to set it up.	I'd recommend this little thing.
0,I recently purchased a 7 octave keyboard workstation and decided I should have a soft case for it.  It makes the trip to church and the occasion gig so I wanted to protect my investment.  I'm comfortable saying that this keyboard gig bag does the job I have asked it to do.  I have plenty of additional room in it for the pedal and power chord and cables to hook it up to the sound system.
0,Nice simple guitar tuner for a beginner.
0,For the money and quality, hard to beat this value. There's better out there of course, but no where near these prices.
0,works good
0,I have several types of capos, this one seems well built.  A little bulky for 5 string banjo especially if you are fingering near it.  I really don't need to change that fast so use it very little, might use more in a performance setting but that is a ways off.
0,I picked this up to help complete an overhaul of my '78 strat. Everything lined up perfectly, and this product was every bit as high quality as the original. Took just over 2 weeks to arrive (which was about what I was expecting). Very pleased with everything.
0,I got the Harmony GTX to replace The Voice Live which was more of a toy with cumbersome menus. The harmony GTX is the real deal. This is a pedal with analog controls and it's is incredibly easy and intuitive to use. I had it up an running in 5 minutes without reading the manual. I recommend this to the serious musician or vocalist, it's more like another analog guitar pedal and it's of solid construction. Great pedal, it's improved my singing tremendously, easy to use, intuitive and just the right amount of voice alteration/supplementation controls. I am a mediocre Solo singer/guitar player and this pedal  makes me sound great. A huge confidence booster in the vocal realm.
0,fits les paul perfectly. Well worth the price. It is well made and nice and plush on the inside.
0,Perfect for the job.
0,Works great. My reverb pedal was eating a 9V battery every session; not any more. I currently use this adapter with Donner, Joyo, and Behringer pedals. I hope to add a Boss pedals soon.
0,I appreciate the fact that my pedal system is now "color coded". Everything works just fine!
0,Awesome unique keyboard with cool functions.  It has a super small footprint  and has replaced my giant midi keyboard :-)
0,Not at all fancy but gets the job done well for the price
0,I used the 64 from the 10-74 set on another guitar and strung my 25" scale 7-string with the other strings for Drop G. After about a week and two recorded tracks, they feel fantastic and sound great.
0,I needed some back up XLR cables for a gig and these came in clutch! I had to wire up 6 speakers and had no issues with them.
0,This guitar is Great!! its definitely butterscotch. Excellent cords. Good quality sound, feel and make.
0,great product
0,This is a basic nylon strap with retro pin-up girl graphics.  Goes well with Gretsch bass.  Seems to be well made like all of the Levi stuff.
0,works
0,Does the job I need it for. Use a pair of them for 8 channels of VDrum sends to the board or main PA snake from an 8ch isolation transformer.
0,Great product!  Fast shipping!  I would buy again : )
0,I needed a way to carry two guitars, and at first I couldn't justify paying more than $75 for a double gig bag.  I bought a cheaper bag at first thinking it would be just fine...not so! The cheaper bag I bought had plastic hardware rings attaching the shoulder straps and thin shoulder straps (strong but uncomfortable). That was a disaster waiting to happen with the weight of two guitars in a bag.		So I looked at the premium bags. The MONO bags looks awesome, but they are just a bit too pricey (but look totally worth it).  So I took a shot on this Gator.  I couldn't be happier with the purchase.  The padding is thick and the guitars are secure inside the bag.  The shoulder straps are heavy duty padded with metal ring/hardware.  There is a rain cover (nice touch).  And it is reasonably light.  The bag has enough stiffness that it keeps a solid shape.  This will not fold in half or bend like the normal thin gig bags.  You can put the bag down on its side using the carry handle and the bag doesn't tip over.  The pockets are roomy and have nice cord wrap ties built in.  Very well thought out bag.		It is big - not big as in wide (although it is wider than a normal bag due to the thick padding), but big as in thick.  It is probably about 12" thick - but to be expected with two guitars.		All in all, I wasn't expecting a big thickly padded bag that keeps its shape, but now that I have it, I cant imagine stuffing guitars into anything less.  The price was well worth it considering the quality (I now think of it as the cost of buying two higher quality bags and then this price becomes very reasonable!).  The convenience of having one bag to the gig is fantastic!
0,Love this Harp  the tone is very clear. I am a Worship Leader and  it sounds great out of the mics
0,I have used the Fender cables for several months, and am very please.	The are well protected, and durable, but easy to handle.
0,Great at acting as a filter for expensive shire microphones and other dynamic microphones. This is used in many shows I go to. Will buy again.
0,The other guys that said this is a direct drop-in replacement for a PRS SE Custom24 are 100% correct.  It fits flawlessly. The height is perfect; the width is perfect.  Heck, even the nut slots are perfectly big enough to accommodate larger gauge strings. I put this on my 2014 CU24 and strung with 11-56 D'Addario (XL117) and tuned it to drop C.  I had to adjust he trem a bit, of course, but now my CU24 doesn't go out of tune when I just look at it funny, which is what it did with the factory 9 gauge strings and crap bit of plastic it had on there.
0,The strings were just what I ordered and worked great
0,I bought this for my vintage Guild F50-R to live in. I travel with it and it's my main guitar for performing solo gigs so I need to keep it safe. The guitar is held in tight by the case and doesn't move around at all. The storage compartment is big enough for a few extra sets of strings, a string winder and a small syringe of nut sauce. Only thing that I don't like about it is that the hinge at the headstock seems to wobble a bit and I sometimes have to squeeze the extruded aluminum edges into the correct location so they interlock like all my other cases. I'd buy another one if I needed because there isn't really anything better out there for a jumbo.
0,Very well made!  I bought this for a friend and I think that I am going to get one for myself.
0,This is a great product made by a great company	 I love it I highly recommend it to everyone yes
0,Excellent service and product.
0,Great guitar picks.
0,I love music and not just one genre, I listen to everything. I got a chance to use these monitors for the last week and I love them. I put them next to my Technics 1200 MK3 turntables and put them through the test of House, Disco House, Hip hop, trance and even some old school rock and they sounded nice with everything. Warm and clear would be the way that I describe what I heard.		The vocal replication was great and the bass wasn't muddy like with some of the monitors I have used.		The cables that came with the speakers were ok so I upgraded them		The green and the black look good in the studio.
0,Better than all the volcas combined. Easy to use. Sounds great
0,Only strings that I use... Personal preference!
0,Just what I needed.  I need to put a few miles on it to know whether it holds up, but it looks very well made.
0,I am running 4 big speakers it is working fine not sure it it is 1400 watts but runs a pair of 750 peak super pro 15 inch speakers and a pair of 12 road gear subs so far I get a big punch aout of it . I tough I had to buy two of this but one works fine. I am running a dj karaoke system. I also got a pyle pro 4 channel mixer and they work fine get cables it only comes with power cable. item received looks diferent I say better.
0,It really mutes the sound without damaging the sound
0,fits fine
0,I really like this mute holder. I not only use it on the gig I keep it on my practice stand and use it to hold all types of things. I bought another mute holder with a clamp because sometimes I have to attach to a chair or something else and I thought that would be the best stand for me. It wasn't this stand will clip about anywhere so don't worry about that. I was worried that the holders might be rough on the corks on quick mute changes but no they aren't, in short I wished I had bought this one before the one with the clamp, then I wouldn't have two.
0,Thank you...
0,good
0,No guitarist can do without a few of these
0,This mic is excellent, it's pretty much a straight up clone of an sm-57  and for the money there are no mic's even close to this one. Also the price at orange county speaker's website is $29 and $25 in store so I'm not entirely sure why it's $50 on Amazon.
0,Works like a charm.  It is well made and the pitch quality is good.  What else can I say, it's a nice all-purpose pitch pipe!
0,Excellent Tenor Ukulele bag for the price.  Got mine for around $18.00.  Good materials and it looks good too.  My students build tenor ukuleles and I want to start including these bags as part of their build.  I recommend them.  Nice 15 mm padding.  It is a very snug fit for tenor ukes.  Hola Heavy Duty Tenor sets the standard for sub $20 Tenor ukulele bags.  If you are looking for a good sub $20 bag make sure it at least has 15mm of padding.	I got burnt when I had to go with an unseen Kala T-UB gig bags. When comparing them to my Hola! Heavy Duty, it is like comparing baseball legend Babe Ruth to Bob Uecker.  In the Ukulele world it comparing Israel "IZ" Kamakawiwo'ole to Jared from Subway.  Gotta go with "Izzy"!
0,Good tone and attractive.
0,Quick delivery, quality parts.
0,Great, lightweight product that easily replaces some of my older lighting that's nearly eight times the size and weight.  Having two synced with a DMX cable easily fills the room.  The extra colors not available in many of the big name lights is great addition (orange, purple and white).  Only time will tell how reliable they are.  I'm not a big fan of the white house (which glows), but aside from that, they're perfect.		As for my background, I'm a professional DJ with 15 years of experience.  I replaced a couple of Chauvet lights with these.  The Kinta X and the Derby X.  These are better.
0,This is my first Ukulele and I bought this one after reading the reviews. Not disappointed! Good quality for the money, but some fret issues I noticed. Stays in tune for a good while, but the neck bridge could be a little lower. Some chords sound out of tune when notes are fretted down low. This may be from the string getting pulled because the neck bridge is too high. A minor annoyance in my opinion. Also bough "Play Ukulele Today". Great starter book!	Finding an online Ukulele tuner was easy, and there's a smartphone app out there too. I've been playing this thing until my fingers hurt!
0,This strap is a really good buy, excellent buy.  Stitching and materials obviously of excellent value, care in manufacturing obvious.  Only beef I would have is Amazon did NOT make it obvious the strap was EXTRA-LONG, which was too long for me and I've seen many reviews before that said it's a nice strap but too long.  Well, be aware there are TWO different Levy straps available:  REGULAR AND EXTRA LONG.  Amazon didn't have this mentioned in the item description, but if you look for the part number and it has"XL" in it, that means extra long.....long enough for an ape with 40 inch arms !!
0,AWESOME ROCK THE BEST
0,I use this stand for a smaller 50 watt Fender amp.  I don't think I would recommend it for larger amplifiers, especially since it sits a little high, but for my amp, it's perfect.  Nevertheless, I also don't really plan on packing it up or moving the stand around much, so I can't imagine it being ideal for portability.  If you have a music studio and are doing more recording and/or rehearsing than playing gigs, this is a really nice stand.
0,he said he really like them and had no complaints to report when I asked him about his opinions. He drums a lot all sorts of styles of music.
0,I bought the first one with a Hard Case, but was really disappointed. 5 Rivets broken on it, so you could tell the long journey from Asia took its toll. But I really like the board itself, and simply re-ordered one with a soft case. I only gig about 4 times a month, so I make sure I'm a little more careful with the board when schlepping it around. Velcro is another issue, in that, depending on the size of you pedal, you might have pedals that come loose during transport. This is because of the spacing between rows.		They need to invent a device that fits the underside of the smaller pedals, that attaches from the back side, and adheres to the board and pedal.		All in all, this is a solid piece of gear, and well worth the investment. I have lots of gear heads drooling at the finished product.
0,Great stand! Sturdy and stable. I use mine at home. Looks nice in my office, too. I purchased a ukulele hook and attached it to the main post. Easily installed in 30 seconds - makes picking up the uke (or violin) on a whim easy to do. I play more due to this combo!
0,The price is right and ordering through Amazon is a convenience. They seem just as well made as the GE and Sylvania lamps we've bought in the past. Time will tell how long they last.
0,Good for price i paid.
0,I got mine for less than 20 bucks. The stand is definitely constructed cheaply but nothing keeps it from functioning as intended. Other reviewers complained about it having a screw together joint in the middle. We have a more expensive stand of the same type with exactly the same feature and no problems with either.
0,Great kit and quality instructions. I replaced electronics in a squire strat with these and it is a major improvement. Comes with everything you would need, and comes with 2 types of wire for your preference. Will buy again for my next project.
0,Love the thickness of these picks.  I have thicker plastic picks for my bass guitar and for some acoustic guitar applications, but for electric guitar these are my ideal.
0,A little more treble that I'd like but, there are 2 factors. It hasn't "broken in" yet and it was only $40. Everyone's ears are different so, if you like a lot of boomy bass, this might not be for you unless you have an EQ. I think this is a perfect "budget" cartridge if you're new to vinyl and want good quality without breaking the bank... Buying the expensive stuff happens when you get hooked!!!
0,Light weight, stable, wide base.  The only complaint I have with them is the chain that attaches the safety pin is very easy to break.  I'll remedy that with something more substantial soon.  A zip tie is working right now.  Overall, great stands for the low price.
0,I swapped from evens g2 coated to these, and they really make my drums sing. I do not like the fact that they are only 1 ply because I have already put a few dents in them. Overall, they sound and look great, but I will opt for a 2 ply version when these wear out.
0,These work the way you think they all should! Sturdy plastic, tight grip, doesnt sag under mic weight. I load up on these regularly.
0,This cart is an absolute BEAST. I have nothing but rave reviews for this workhorse. Easy to use and space-saving design!
0,Sounds excellent for my Yamaha F335.
0,Best guitar humidifier I have ever owned which is flexible and convenient for use
0,Exceeded my expectations what beautiful microphones. Definitely ordering from you again. Bob
0,I learned to tune my violin on a pitch pipe and considered this for my students but they understand red & green lights and they are not old enough to tune by ear.  I'm fairly new at oredering on internet and THIS COMPANY was exceptional at working with me & understanding my mistakes.  The tuners are perfect for my students and their parents are very happy with the price of these.  I will do business with this company in the future. JP Henderson, Ok
0,quality knock-off. truly not as good as a shure, though.
0,Good Product and well made
0,This wind screen does not tear easily and expands over the microphone with ease... Excellent value and highly recommended for any use.
0,I really like these sticks. Shipped in a large box, but quicker than expected.
0,nice
0,too beautiful. Makes the headstock glow with "rich" holds key/tuning.  totally happy. will buy more; great value
0,Its official, I am now a way better Bass player (or at least I sound better now) due to this little gem of a pedal that I wouldn't trade for a trip to Hawaii!
0,Excellent service and product.
0,I recently bought a used fender stratocaster classic 50's.  It had aged pickup covers and knobs and a stark white single ply pick guard that did not lie flat against the body.  It made the guitar look kind of cheap,even though it was supposed to be period authentic.  I saw this on Amazon and, for the price, decided to give it a try.  It is very well made, just as good as a Fender product in my opinion.  It maches the pickups and knobs perfectly and gives the guitar a more mellow appearance.  Just make sure if you need the 8 hole or 11 hole version.
0,This is a nice ligature.  It fit my mouthpiece well and worked well with my reeds.  I generally play pretty hard and found the mouthpiece good for this kind of playing.  I really think it is more about appearance, which is funny because most people don't know what a ligature should look like.  The gold colored plating is solid and the piece appears well made.  The cap is a cap- so it works.		All in all a good ligature.
0,It's always to find Just The Right adapter for a product whose A/C adapter has run off or died. This was a real life saver.
0,I am really undecided on these, yes they provide a really rich tone for both highs and lows, are they really worth the considerable cost compared to other high quality strings, only time will tell but for now they sound great.
0,It's light and easy to move, guitars are secure and it includes a 5 year guaranty from the manufacturer. Cool.
0,I have used Dunlop Nylon picks for at least 10 years as they have the right thickness and texture to grip, but I've always missed the attack of Delrin, well, these Dava's were exactly what the Dr. ordered.  The rubber grip, although thick, feels right and the Delrin tip gives me the sound I have been missing.  Definitely a winner.
0,Nice and does the job
0,I've read the reviews that say 'stay away it's junk'. But i got for a 20 at a local place as it has tremelo on it which I don't have. Yes behringer does have it's issues but I own a gmx 1200, a hell babe wah, an eq, a mixer board and all those have been dependable (knock on wood) so after months of eyeing this for the past few months at a local store I pulled the trigger. For a 20 I got the pedal a 6 month warranty. It is used, but I tested it out thought it was having issues and almost passed. Come to find out a faulty guitar cord and a cheap dollar store battery were the issue. You see I've learned that multi pedals like this eat up batteries fast so you either need to buy a quality akaline battery or use a power supply. So the cons are of course plastic casing but its a bargain pedal so I can live with it. No clicking knob to indicate switching but who cares. This thing sounds good I've tested through several amps and have gotten a lush chorus, nice trem, juicy flanger etc.. Each effect is very usable. I have a morley chorus pedal and this is almost as good. If you set this pedal up right every effect is great. The pitch shift almost can sound like a boss octave and that pedal is a 100 dollar pedal. The knobs also feel cheap but are precise and the level, and para knobs give you all the control you'll need. Yes as with all products there are issues and lemons. But some of the bad reviews seem like it's more a lack of knowledge than the pedal.
0,Realistically, there is no best ukulele string for everyone. I love these strings on my laminate mid-range ukulele. The girlfriend thinks they are too harsh for her solid-acacia ukulele and she replaced her strings with flouro-carbons. If you read the ukulele nerd forums, you will see long discussions about ukulele strings and different people disagreeing about which strings are best even for the same brand and model of instrument. Bottom line is the best strings for you are a personal decision, based largely on what sound you like and what kind of music you play and what is your skill level. Strings are cheap enough and easy enough to install that, as soon as you develop a good enough ear to tell the difference, you may as well try a few on your ukulele and figure it out for yourself.		As with all ukulele strings, they do take a while to settle in. I had to tune them after every 15 minutes of playing for the first couple of days. Every 30 minutes for the next few days. Once an hour for the next week. After a month, I only have to tune them a couple of times a week (or when the room is much cooler or warmer).		Note that Aquila "New Nylgut" strings can come in either a brown package or a yellow package. Apparently, they are the same thing, but the brown ones are last year's version. There is a different darker brown package labeled Aquila "Super Nylgut" that is a slightly different formulation for a somewhat higher price. Most reviewers say the price difference is not worth it.
0,3 nice sets of 10's for a decent price.	I always like D'Addario quality. Can't beat this price for 3 sets.
0,Powerful little light.  I use this in my mobile DJ setup.  It only goes on or off so I put one behind me to create a cool effect for my booth.
0,The afro is back..		fits well on the Blue Yeti Pro; Audio quality retention is good.		not much more to say.
0,I was freaking out when our old microphone broke and I couldn't do basement Karaoke, but now I am free to sing loudly (and off-key) again!
0,There is no real M5.8 mm size. These are really the common 12-24 USA size. They work fine on a Pearl Forum drum set. Excellent fit and finish.
0,Cushion padded on the inside that won't scratch and holds tight on your guitar frets/neck. Nice rosewood texture that blends aesthetically with any acoustic guitars. Clamps with sufficient strength and easy to put in and out of clamp. Looks sturdy yet simple.
0,This interface can be used for home and professional studios, working with Pro Tools M-Powered, giving you a great work from it. The thing that I don't like from this interface is the pre amp. For condenser microphones it works fine but with other mics, the result is not good as when you turn the power phantom on; you have to turn on the full gain knob when you are working with a mic like Shure Sm57 or 58. It works better if you plug a mix console between the mics and this interface.
0,Excellent!
0,Been using these strings since the 80's. Nothing else will do. Can't beat the savings on a 10 pack, when you have several guitars.
0,I bought the Apogee Jam after being thoroughly disappointed with the iRig guitar interface. Like most inexpensive interfaces, the iRig uses the Mic input on the headphone jack of the iPad/iPhone for results that are noisy and low-fi, which simply takes the fun out of apps like Amplitube or GarageBand.		The Apogee Jam uses a direct digital in via the Dock connector, and cleared all that junk up in a hurry. It works perfectly in both Amplitube (v2.5 and up) and GarageBand, with low noise and a clean, fat signal. The input gain control is simple and useful, and because the headphone jack isn't being used you can hear your instrument through the iPad speaker if you wish.		There isn't much more to say. I am using it with a 3rd-gen iPad and iPhone 4S, and finally have a pocket-sized guitar rig that I can really enjoy. Huzzah!
0,Ive had maybe 8-9 tuners in my life,	this one ranks #1	in ease of use.		It's very durable, heavy, cool looking,	and just cool.		I love it.		Thanks Donner!		This is my fifth pedal by that brand.
0,it has a good length, very easy to pull-put back, doesn't take much space and sound-jack quality is pretty good.		One thing, I wish one end was a L-shaped jack, that'd make my life so much easier. when you sit down with your guitar on your bed for example, and the jack of the guitar is on the side, you would want to have an L shaped jack. I have a Jackson Kelly, and struggle with that a little. Totally my fault though, not the product's. Just wanted to warn potential buyer on that.
0,Best tuner I've owned. So easy to use. I like the flat option.  I love being able to use my acoustic too. It's just so precise. So much better than my old clip on and way faster than my amps built in tuner. Small enough to fit into my hard case pocket. Perfect. I've read korg is the best. I'm a believer.
0,Just looking at it, you definitively have a totally underestimated impression. This model is GREAT for training! Nothing less you expect from an Orange :)	The finishing is great. The size is perfect for a small room. The 6" speaker surprises because makes a big sound - the max volume will certainly bother your neighbors.	The 3 equalization knobs make it very versatile, from thin (like a Fender's frontman G10 - settings: Low at 10:00 and High at 2:00) to a warm fat sound.	The High Gain / Overdrive controls allow many different combinations. With Gain at 3:00 and Overdrive at 12:00 you get a beautiful bluesy tone ! By the way, for me, the GAIN control is one of the keys on this amp.	To be perfect just needed a reverb ... but it is not enough to give less than 5 stars!
0,This is a perfect case if you have six SM58 mics or ones of a similar shape.	If you put the foam windscreens on your mics, they will still fit in this case, and the windscreens offer a little extra protection on the bottom where it is a tad thin, but the mics lay in there held up by the ball end, and only a tiny bit of the base touches the bottom. It is a little tight with all six in place with windscreens on, but they are secure, and the top closes easily enough, and the latches and the handle and the exterior all seem built to last. The Gator logo lets you know which side is up, if you had any doubts.	If you have some other configuration of microphones, or a different number than six, this may need some adaptation, but we use four regularly, and have two for backups or to add one if necessary. Before we were using one of the Vault cases, with some other stuff in there to take up the extra space, but this is far superior. Couldn't be better for our use.
0,amazing cymbal! the trashiest china I've heard in my life that isn't ozone. very loud and projecting, and for the price you aren't going to get any better I can promise you now. I've been buying Wuhan cymbals for years now and I must say they are all very very nice, each cymbal (from ride to crash to china) all sound amazing. one downside, they are made thin. that's what gives them such beautiful resonance and sound. but because of that they do tend to dent and break easily. as long as you've got a cymbal bag though you should be able to extend the life of the cymbals by at least 2-fold, mine are lasting me about 8 months or so before I have to replace but I'm not exactly too careful with them either
0,Korg did a wonderful job with the new kp3+. I use it with my microkorg xl+ and kpro+ combo. It adds so much more elements to different sounds that can be created. Awesome to the max.
0,The same week I bought this to add to a mobile AV setup the surge protector in our small conference room died due to being dropped and banged around too many times so the Furman ended up there.  This unit looks and feels professional, and thanks to the long cable it can be out of the way or in the middle of the conference table when needed.  I took off 1 star because all outlets face the same way
0,Great Product, as advertised.
0,This is a great, compact, lightweight stand.  The head folds down and the bottom rest folds in half, so it travels more compactly than the other stands I have that look like it.  It's stable and light.  Very nice!
0,The sound is amazing! I purchased these after much research, primarily for use in electronic music production monitoring and mixing. I wanted the ability to mix and monitor through the phones or through monitor speakers without a significant difference in what I'm hearing. There is little difference in the range and quality between these phones and the 6" KRK Rockits that are used as monitor speakers. The phones and speakers compliment each other quite nicely.		These phones are comfortable. - I can wear them for many hours without noticing them on my head other than an occasional adjustment. The ear pads are soft and seal nicely to reduce any noticable bleed either in or out of the device. The three cord lengths are nice too. Who wants a 3 meter cable when they are on the couch or train? Alternately, the 3 meter coil is nice when sitting at my desk moving between laptop and 3 midi controllers. It has plenty of reach and stays out of the way. The case included in this bundle is a nice touch. I know that these phones will be protected should I decide to hang this case on my backpack.		I have been so impressed with the sound quality of these phones that I gave some casual listening time to them as well. The dynamic range is excellent. I've listened to albums that I've known and loved for decades with new appreciation.
0,Thanks to these strings, I can still play like someone that can't play a guitar.  It would be unfair to deduct stairs due to my own inability to play.  Bought a guitar that needed strings and the reviews were good and the price was right.  Sorry, I can not offer a legitimate critique.
0,Ok
0,I'm using these for an 11 channel pre-amp/amp configuration. They work. They're a good length for my application, and the colors are convenient for keeping the channels separated.		I'm not sure what would make these particularly better or worse than any other XLR patch cords. The main thing you try to do is keep your AC current cables away from your low voltage / DC cables, and never run them in parallel with each other, so I don't know if these are particularly well shielded or anything else special, but they do the job (connecting a pre-amp to an amp) and they are easy to work with (which is a big bonus in tight places).
0,Listen,If you want an inexpensive guitar with great sound and easy playability, buy this one.  Period.		I bought a black one to leave in the trunk while I was at work, in case the guys called for a practice session, so I wouldn't have to go all the way home to pick up my gear.		I have other, way more expensive guitars, like a Gibson ES-335, Dean 12 string, and a Fender Strat, but I gotta tell you, I like this one soooo much I play it more than the others!  No kidding.		And if it gets banged up, so what???  It costs a buck thirty!  Buy another.  In facte I bought 2 others with different finishes, just for a cheap change up guitar.		Dig it.
0,Excellent!!!..
0,Replaced Squire stock pots for a big improvement.
0,Excellent!
1,Horrible sound from the mic pres.  I spent hours with the Ui12 i bought and could not remove the huge amount of white noise from the outputs.  I took it to Mass and simply could not use it.  It is really a piece of junk.  Great technology with the wifi but I would have spent more to get usable mic pre amps.  I sent it back and ordered the Behringer XR 16 which is getting great reviews on sound quality.	I do not recommend the Ui series mixers.
1,My guitar originally came with D'Addrio exp and they sounded good. I replaced them with Elixir nanoweb coated strings and they also sounded good, but the finish was wearing fast. This time I got a 3 pack of EJ16-3d light. The were easy to put on and have held up well other than tarnishing quickly.	But the sound is the problem. It's terrible. They sound very muddy. Crisp tone distinction is just not there. I thought light would be the better route, but now I'm not sure. I purchased some others to try. Also, since a purchased a 3 pack. I may just change the strings completely again to see If I just have some dead strings.
1,These get a memory error after some use and they are practically worthless after the error pops up.
1,I was so happy to receive this audio headset microphone and for the price you cant beat it. but i had plug it to my pa system pwma8601 and the output to the mic. does not work, you cant barely hear your voice. i don't know if i have to add something to it but the voice is very low.
1,It came from the package broken, its bent and you have to mess with the plug to make sound come out of it. Its a useless piece of cheap rubbish. Don't buy.
1,I ordered this wireless PA system from PylePro for a horseback riding/teaching facility. Right from the beginning I was very disappointed in the limits for the transmitter range. When the instructor walked a mere 60 feet from the unit the signal was intermittent. I improved the signal slightly by installing an external receiving antenna just outside of the small building the equipment was installed in. The transmitting antenna on the belt transmitters are extremely poorly made and pulled out on both the units supplied. I understand that things like this can happen but here is the really big problem. Customer service is NON-EXISTANT with this company.  I can't even count how many times I have called them and been put through their cue only to leave mutable messages for their parts/service department that NEVER gets returned! After at least ten attempts over mutable days, I finally got some guy that could barely speak English (sounded Asian) and he assured me that someone would call me so I could order parts. Guess what, no call yet again. Out of pure frustration I called yet again and went through their sales department pleading with them to put me through to someone that could provide me with the needed parts. It appears that they answer their sales lines. This time I finally got my order placed through a very rude employee that seemed to be put out that he had to help me. I would ovoid this company like the plague purely based on the worst customer service ever. I hate this company and will never use them again.
1,Have to send back for repairs! Defect
1,Not sure what kind of guitar these are cut for, but these are cut way too low.  The high E string sits on top of the frets it's so bad and would have to use a shim.  Shims are for punk amateurs, these should be cut correctly at a higher height.
1,This clip on tuner would not give me a read out every time. I tried three different places on the headstock of my bass (Gretsch G2202 short scale). I will probably try it again later, but first impressions are not good.
1,This is the first foam ball I have purchased that actually comes with a warning that it can cause cancer.  Not sure if this applies across the board for all foam balls, but the warning scared the beejeebies out of me, so it's still in the plastic bag it came from.  I may return them.
1,Absolute piece of junk. Stopped working after second use. Unfortunately, my window of opportunity to return it had expired.
1,Nothing but static... Won't pick up sound.  Waste of money.
1,So much promise but lack of quality control. Upon first use the device sounded fine at first then after a minute or so the volume would go to 11 and there'd this insane static. Had to rip the headphones off it was so loud and horrible.		I read several reviews that talk about the same problem. This could have been a game changing device but instead it's a piece of junk.		Avoid at all cost.
1,This is an expensive device that is about as well thought out as malaria.  The battery which has an extremely short lifetime at best, will go out in a few hours if you leave the guitar plugged in.  Which I care little about expensive 9volt batteries, but its also a pain to change the battery.  It requires a jeweler phillips as a standard phillips will not suffice.  Just plain piss poor engineering for an expensive device that is not well thought out and not user friendly.		I would highly recommend choosing another preamp, until such time as these guys learn some practical engineering.
1,You get what you pay for. They shipped it in a bad box with nothing around it. Mine was bent when it came. I got this one because I thought it would be sturdy but it is super light and flimsy. I am going to return it and get a more expensive one.
1,Pretty but very small and doesn't "sing" .
1,Wrongly wired.
1,Very small, can't even get my finger in this damn thing
1,I can't really speak to how well it works as an equalizer, because I rejected it because of the extra noise it introduced.  It seemed to be reasonably well made and I was disappointed that it wasn't usuable.
1,hated it, not better that the Remo Palam patches, don't buy this bc they will fall off over time, and its not as durable.
1,I really thought I was going to like this pickup (MIM Tele) but I don't like the sound at all.  I think it's misleading considering it's a humbucker.  It sounds really thin.  It's not great for smooth warm tones at all but it's pretty decent with some distortion.  I wouldn't recomend it to a friend and I've already sold it.		I realize its a mini humbucker
1,This is a passable stand for the price, I suppose, but not a good fit for my tenor ukulele. It will likely function alright if no one is near it, but I'll not take a chance where I might be placing my instrument on it quickly or where someone might brush by. Additionally, the arms are a bit short, though they can be pulled out a little, but the caps on the ends extend awkwardly over the instrument side of the foam and threaten to scratch the instrument finish. The "pad" behind the instrument back is a very thin felt sticker and doesn't cover well, so I'll replace it with a more substantial felt pad that will actually cover the metal to wood areas.
1,i don't know if i just got a dud but, i went through 3 high e strings in 3 days. the first one snapped before it could get to e, the second one snapped while loosening the string (seriously!?). and the third one just snapped while sitting in high e.
1,Hasn't proven to be worth the time, doesn't hold the rosin and seldom grabs the strings. Still looking for a better one, thanks.
1,making loud noise
1,The bag was a good fit for my Epiphone Viola bass. (a Beatle bass copy)	It is lightweight & appears well made.	HOWEVER...it does NOT HAVE 20mm of protection...it is only about 11mm	That is about half of what they claim	**** THIS IS FALSE ADVERTISING ****
1,A very little guitar. Dificult to afinate.	Disappointed.
1,The housing for the tambourine discs was decent quality, as was the strap but the discs fell out within a few weeks of use. I am a street busker so as you can imagine, I used this quite often. I suggest anyone with the same interests to buy a foot pedal and a tambourine with an attachment. However, if you are gonna use it sparsely then it's not a bad buy!
1,I'm returning to drumming after, oh, 40 years or so.  Just hacking around and found that I kept dropping the sticks, so I looked around and found sticks with this coating or that which promised to be grippier, easier to hold onto.  The concept is logical and I'm sure there are some out there that do the job, but these did nothing for me.  I'll probably try some gloves; this brand has an awesome rep and if they can't get it right I'm wondering if anybody can.
1,Bought this item for use by an officiant at an outdoor wedding in a garden setting.		The Pyle-Pro PWMA200 worked, but it could have been much better.		First, it isn't loud enough.		Second, when you increase the volume, the speaker distorts badly.		Third, no matter which microphone, of the three included, you use, they all cut in and out or produce static when someone is speaking, making it very hard to understand what anyone is saying. This reason, in and of itself, is enough for me to withhold a recommendation for this item.		For any event, it is important that the person using the microphone & PA system to be heard. This product fails in this regard.		It looks like Pyle has flooded the market with many different varieties of poor PA systems. It's unfortunate. I would look to a different brand altogether if you need a portable, battery powered, PA system.
1,good
1,Not worth the price. Don't waste your money.
1,These cases are 5-Star quality, however the Amazon submission is a bit dodgy! Check out the Manufacturer's (SKB) site!  The illustrations shown on Amazon for this Mid-sized case (above) are for the MUCH larger SKB X-1 Large Drum Hardware Case, see the dimensions below. The X-1 Large case has the removable tray as shown here for the Mid-sized Case. The Mid-sized case has no such removable tray. The BIG visual give-away is the molded-in marks on the case.  The Mid-sized case has longitudinal ribs along the top and sides. You'll note that this Amazon item's illustrations depict "X"-shaped raised areas molded into the case top, sides, ends and probably the bottom as well. The Mid-sided case DOES have an extendable handle, similar to some suitcases and other equipment cases. The X-1 Large case illustrated here is SO tall that when stood on its wheels an extendable handle, as noted by Amazon, would extend to eye-level and beyond. That would be cute but hardly useful. This, as illustrated, X-1 Large case uses a D-Ring type handle which you can see in the illustrations provided by Amazon.  FYI: the Large case is about $310 retail and the exterior measures about 41"L x 18.5"W x 17.63"D. The Mid-sized case is about $160 retail and the exterior measures about 35.5"L x 16.75"W x 14.5"D. You can check out the INTERNAL Dimensions at the SKB site. Both are great cases BUT ... very different.  Buyer Beware!!!
1,I do not know why these have such a high rating. Don't get them! Check out shure a56d instead or lp claw, you're welcome!
1,I ordered this wireless PA system from PylePro for a horseback riding/teaching facility. The unit itself worked okay at first but right from the beginning I was very disappointed in the limits for the transmitter range. When the instructor walked a mere 60 feet from the unit the signal was intermittent. I improved the signal slightly by installing an external receiving antenna just outside of the small building the equipment was installed on. The transmitting antenna on the belt transmitters are extremely poorly mounted and pulled out on both the units supplied. I understand that things like this can happen but here is the big problem. Customer service is NON-EXISTANT with this company.  I can't even count how many times I have called them and been put through their cue only to leave mutable messages for their parts/service department that NEVER gets returned! After at least ten attempts over mutable days, I finally got some guy that could barely speak English (sounded Asian) and he assured me that someone would call me next week to order parts. Guess what, no call to me was placed. Out of pure frustration I called yet again and went through their sales department pleading with them to put me through to someone that could provide me with the needed parts. It appears that they answer their sales lines. This time I finally got my order placed through a very rude employee that seemed to be put out that he had to help me. I would ovoid this company like the plague purely based on the worst customer service ever. I hate this company and will never use them again.
1,We hosted a seminar at my job so my boss gave me $400. I bought this, a stand and a cable. Plugged it into the mixer and it seemed to work so I left for the night. The next day the seminar speaker used it. He stood 20 feet away from the receiver. When he walked further than 20 feet or behind anyone or anything (such as a pillar) it dropped. I stopped the seminar in the middle of 300 guests to switch channels. no luck. I stopped him again to switch frequencies. No luck. When it was over the president came up to me and said, "You ruined the event." I took full responsibility but no, I didn't ruin it, Shure ruined our event with the cheapest piece of junk I've ever laid eyes on in my 30 years of doing audio. As a graduated audio engineer, I've worked with hundreds of mics and systems in my lifetime. In all my life I have never ever seen or held a cheaper mic in all my life. This garbage isn't suited to give to your 2 year old to play with in the car. It's featherlight and feel like it's made of thin plastic with nothing inside. The receiver is super thin and cheaply made. The mic is equally thin and light as if it is a toy. What the heck was I thinking? I'll never ever buy another sure product as long as I live and neither should you. Sure sold out and now they simply suck. They now specialize in selling cheap dollar store junk. What a horrible terrible product experience. Shure, you used to be such an amazing company with a rich audio history, why did you sell your soul to the devil? You ruined my reputation because I banked on you. I won't make that mistake again.
1,If you are familiar with TC Helicon products you know they make some great vocal processors like the Harmony G-XT, which I own and love.  However, the Harmony G-XT will not work with a bass guitar which is my current instrument.		I needed a solution to this problem.  According to all of the research I did, the Voicelive Play seemed like a perfect solution to my problem.  The Voicelive Play has built in mics that pick up your band mate's instruments and will assign the proper key to the vocal harmonies it produces.  Great!  Right?		Here's the problem...I had my bass guitar on, I had the Voicelive play hooked up properly, and the moment I touched my lips to the mic I got ZAPPED quite badly.  Ok, so I wasn't grounded properly.  I went to hit the ground switch on the Voicelive Play and guess what...there isn't one!  No ground switch!  Are you kidding me?  There is no way I will be able to use this thing.		It's going back today.  Very disappointed.  Add a ground switch!
1,This is supposed to be a 440 hz tuning fork. It's not. It's around 447 hz. Other than that...it's got okay sustain, I guess. We'll see how re-tuning it with a file goes.
1,Looks and feels like poor quality plastics. What can I say? Expected more from Martin.
1,There was bleed over from one channel to the other. The microphones sort of shut off when there is no speaking and miss the first word of every sentence when one begins speaking. I did not have high expectations considering how affordable the unit was but I was sadly still disappointed. Every channel had to be full volume so volume control is a waste. To return would have cost too much for shipping so it sits in a box on a shelf.
1,This is a pretty poor item from the orient. It comes with poor directions and no support. I lost some effects and there appears to be no way to recover. Directions for use are lacking. Meaning of adjustment is lacking. Basically, I threw $100 away. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!
1,This is a great product for those that know what a mA is and how much their pedalboard draws....		I'm changing my 5 star review (for function) to a 2 star review due to poor reliability.  The mini-B connector that Pedaltrain chose for their design is an unacceptably poor component.  This is where you connect to the USB cable to recharge the device and is an absolutely essential connection.  The cheap metal bends.  The internal connector block becomes misaligned.  It can't be fixed or replaced.  Mine failed in 1.5 years and now I can only throw it away.		Not going to buy another.  Hopefully another company will find a way to build one of these with decent components.  Until then, it's back to an AC connection.
1,This is a microphone that is strange in a couple of ways.  Even though the bottom has an XLR connector (the standard connector for wired microphones) it does NOT use a standard XLR cable.  The only cable it will work with is the provided cable that converts their proprietary XLR connector to a USB cable that it uses for power and a 3.5mm plug that plugs into a PC or laptop via a 3.5mm port.  If you don't have a microphone port on your machine you cannot use this microphone.  The USB cable provided here is strictly to power the microphone.		On my first test with the microphone I got a loud screeching sound, something that seems like a common issue.  Moving the USB power cable to another USB hub solved that issue so if you are getting screeching try a different USB port / power brick to power the microphone and you may solve that problem.		I tried powering the device up with a USB adapter and plugging the 3.5mm cable via a 1/4inch adapter into my mixing board and barely got a signal so really the only place you can use this microphone is plugged into a laptop or PC with a 3.5mm jack.		The sound quality of the microphone overall was excellent for the price-point of $29.99.  It is a condenser microphone so it will pick up a lot of room noise, it's just the way condenser microphones work.  If you want to block out room noise try a dynamic microphone or use a noise-gate in your audio chain.		Overall this is a decent microphone that lost major points with me by needing the very specific cord that comes with it to work as it makes it limited to strictly using it with your laptop or PC and if you ever lose or damage the cord the microphone itself is useless.		Sample provided for review.
1,The output level of the bridge pickup was too low to even install.  I am working on a return.  Bummer.
1,I have another Snark tuner which is much larger and love it. I thought the smaller version would be a nice-to-have and the price was right. Don't waste your money. It says you are in tune, but is several cents off. As a professional guitarist I can attest that there are far better choices at around the same price. The Planet Waves version is also in my collection and blows this one away.
1,I was stoked to finally be able to upgrade my speakers. Everyone has the rockets so naturally, I buy the rockets - I figured they MUST be good. First of all these get 1 star from me because they take a second to 'warm up' sometimes, they seem triggered to turn on by volume and it's really annoying in a situation where you're trying to make music. Apparently people are replacing fuses on these things all the time, and I don't have time for that. Secondly, as far as sound goes, they are overly bassy and muffled. I have never use a word so strongly on of my Amazon reviews, but these speakers are truly garbage.		They will hurt your mixing skills because they are not true reference speakers!
1,made the sound of any microphone I used sound like someone threw a blanket over the speaker...muffled and loses articulation.
1,I bought one of these to use with my Fender Blues Junior III amp.  Love the amp, but this switch is not worth your time.  First, it's very light.  It's so light that it doesn't even want to sit flat on the floor; the cable tends to tilt it.  It also lacks an LED to indicate the switch state, which is always nice in a footswitch.  Another thing I don't really like is the fact that the cable is permanently attached to the switch; I'd prefer a cable that plugs in to the switch housing, as well as into the amp.  Lastly, and most importantly, this thing stopped working within days.  It went from working intermittently to not working at all with only the lightest and mildest of use.		What I'd like to see: a footswitch that's heavy and solid enough to sit flat and stable, durable enough to stand up to normal use, and has an LED to indicate the state of the switch.  This fails all three criteria.
1,UM2 gets an F, Behringer Support F-.  Non-functionable w/ most I/O audio settings/MIDI setup on Mac w/OSX 10.6.8.  I tried 3 cables.  Tried Audacity and Trackitron  Emailed Behringer - their support is HORRIBLE and their website is among the most un-userfriendly I've ever seen.  Why isn't UM2 advertised that it must have Mac 10.7 or later?  Product description states it'll work with any Mac or PC.  Its boxed for refund and return next week.  Unless someone is kind enough to offer solutions I will upgrade the rating if I can get it to work.
1,I wanted to like this.  The value was right and it seemed like a great solution for my tenor, alto, soprano practice room.  BUT, unfortunately it hasn't worked out.	There are 2 problems with this:		1 - The stand does not work on any surface except a hard surface and even on a hard surface, I'm worried.  On any carpet, this is very unstable.  The problem are the two little feet that you can see next to the soprano pegs.  They are simply too short to be stable.  Turns out much of the weight of a sax is on those two little feet.  So on a carpet especially, the feet are pushed downward and the balance tips the saxes back and over.  Exactly what you don't want to happen.		2 - The cushioned areas on the stand for the alto/tenor spots don't work well for tenor.  The bottom of the bell hits the metal at the bottom of the brace.  Might be correctable if you made the lower cushion (not the top "Y" cushion but the second smaller cushion extended out a little.  Basically the whole tenor sax is flush against that metal rail and the bottom knocks on the sax.  So lay it on there very slowly because it will touch metal to metal.  Over time, I'm sure this will wear off the lacquer at the minimum.		Overall, like I said, I wanted to like this stand but it didn't happen.  For all you other sax players out there, move on and try something else.
1,This is G7th's little brother to the G7th G7 Performance 2 capo which I own and love. This barely works on a guitar, at least a good acoustic one. It's too weak and flimsy in comparison to the same capo they make and market as the G7th G7 Performance 2 Capo....that's the one you want, and it will be the last capo you will ever use or buy. I needed a backup, and this doesn't qualify as a worthy capo on any level. You can tell the difference in size and weight....the G7th G7 Performance 2 Capo is more expensive, is heavier in weight and in girth. I wasted good money on this not knowing they added this cheap junk to get folks to buy in at a lower price point....$67 for the "good one," versus $37 for this junk. Buyer beware!
1,Something its bad with the one i got, im getting a lot of noise with more than 2 pedals, its useless for me.
1,Okay,  Color coding is a GREAT idea.		Divas will not use the red ball windscreen.		Why?		Because, from a distance it looks like they have a clown nose.		No kidding!  I have had several tell this to me and my sound tech.  So save your dough, buy any color but RED.		Diva's!!!!  What can I say?
1,I did not expect that the device runs on 120 -volt electricity Alas and non-transferable to a 220 -volt electricity
1,What a scam..... 4 picks and a tiny crapy tin case..... I feel like a real sucker buying this...... Never.... NEVER again....
1,All that came with the guitar was Bag, Strap, Whisle.  Needs to be finish by hand or ship it back...  Stain as well inside the tuner pegs, with wood shaving.
1,Personally I love D'Addario strings, but I thought I would try something new so I got these. I myself didn't like the coating, or the sounds as much as the strings I'm used to... I actually hated these and couldn't wait to get them off my guitar, but they also sounded brighter, and I like a warmer sound. Strings are trial and error, so try them out for yourself, because a lot of people love these.
1,This pickguard did not fit my Fender P bass, it would not fit over the standard pick ups without having to file the pickguard. screws line up but won't fit right... maybe the problem is there are so many P basses out there...squier..mexican ..american..etc and this description was too vague.
1,Don't like the sound on my Taylor 814e.  The Phosphor Bronze sound much more rich and articulate.
1,Didn't quite last a year. It's a very light pedal, and doesn't really feel steady and sturdy enough under the foot, as well. The M-Audio one lasts a little longer, and is sturdier while it lasts (not much longer than this one, though). I haven't found a pedal that lasts more than a year or two, with heavy use. But, this was the fastest death.
1,It's really too short. you can't get far enough away from the amp to eliminate feedback and interference.
1,Sturdy and easy to assemble. But I've mounted seven 1U modules and encountered 2 holes not properly threaded.
1,Pro's	Metal		Cons	It's a toy.	Anyone telling you this is a professional-grade microphone is not qualified to tell you that.	Terrible signal problems, artifacts, constant hum, internals are terrible.
1,I've purchased two of these and they've both broken within a week: Sadly, the plastic clip is too cheaply made and fragile it breaks off very easily. Would not recommend.
1,I've been using daddario for over a decade and I got really disappointed. the first set I opened was okay, but the second featured a very prolongued coating defect. I don't intend to return the whole package because I'm not living in the US now. but I definitely won't buy another.
1,After around 10 years of using these, I am finally switching to a different brand. The last 4 3set packs I have purchased came with at least 1 string deffective. Waste of time and money. Sometimes you can tell the string is deffective right away, but other times it takes a few strummings. This last one started to de-tune by itself brand new.
1,There are those that love coated strings and those that don't so this is just my opinion. I put a set of these on my vintage Ovation. These strings sound coated and the Martin SP's I was using sound so much better. Plus after just one week of play there's material flaking off the strings. If you want a really good sounding acoustic string that's treated to last month to 3 months that doesn't have a coated string then try Martin Lifespan's. I love Lifespan but won't be buying anymore Elixirs.
1,Didn't do what it said it would do.
1,Nothing like their older units from the 80's and early 90's. I have an old beat up one I bought new back in 88 and it is a smoother and warmer with a natural tube breakup and push. These new ones sound smothered and artificial. Sorry but the new one is back in the box and on a shelf.
1,Wrong fit
1,NOT FOR ME
1,Too lightly built for an AT 835b even without baffle. When I put on a very light dead cat, it droops in the holder and will bottom with movement. Might be OK for a lighter, smaller mic.
1,Didn't work with my CCTV camera.... either too dim or not a real IR bulb.
1,two saddle came scratched
1,The strobe sensitivity is inconsistent and does not offer the lighting I'd hoped for. This would be much better if the strobe effect could be slower and controlled.
1,The keyboard itself feels very cheap and light.  The keys are loose but do have some tension when pressed.  The nobs are loose and cheap feeling also.  The pads have a decent feel.  The software is ridiculous.  There is no support for connecting with Presonus Studio One.  After using the editor program I still can't load programs into the pads.  The MPC software should not be needed if you are already running a DAW, but apparently to get the full use of the controller, you need to learn this entirely new program which is not at all user friendly and just seems to be a waste of space.  I've gotten better results plugging in my kids "Rockband" game keyboard and using it. If you're running Studio One, I would suggest you find a different product.  There does seem to be support and a knowledge base for other DAWs though.
1,The handle and spring strength make this uncomfortable to place on the guitar, and I feel rushed to clamp on the capo because it's unpleasant to use - hurts the fingers. It's cheap and easy to use. It'll do the job, but I don't like it.
1,Had a tune-o-matic with one saddle that was cut too deep - thought I'd give these a try since I've had good results with TUSQ and synthetic nuts . . .ordered correct, specific parts and still needed filing to fit (ok with that so far). . .then one cracks! Save yourself the trouble, go buy a brass saddle or other metal.
1,I ran a test between this mic and my Rode shotgun.  This sounds like tin, thin and lifeless.  A surprise from a good audio brand, and I was hoping the reviews were accurate.  Nope. This is overpriced cheap mic.  The only thing better is the form-factor and battery is AA.  But who cares when the audio quality is completely weak.
1,one of my students brought this in and it wouldn't even play once new out of the case.  poor kid was almost in tears.  only buy from a music store, I have a lot of experience with these "off" brands and they are always a waste of money.
1,I recently remodeled my office, and decided to hang my many guitars.  I have several on a long piece of Slatwall, and the rest hung up on individual hangers.  I have three of these String Swing hangers, and two each from Hercules and On-Stage.  The Hercules were purchased here on Amazon, and the On-Stage are the brand favored by the local guitar store, so I got them there.		Of the three, my favorite is easily the Hercules.  The wood is the most nicely finished, and the hanger pivots more freely, and locks the neck in place when the guitar is hung from it.  But when I went to order more, they weren't in stock.  Amazon has spoiled me...when I want something, I want it right now, and I could get the others quicker.  The Hercules hangers are also twice the cost of the other two, but that wasn't a factor for me...after all, you're hanging an expensive instrument...who really want's to skimp on the only thing keeping it from damage?		Next, I prefer the On-Stage brand.  I looked for them on Amazon, but didn't find them.  They don't lock the guitar in place like the Hercules, but the yokes are strong, and pivot freely accommodating all types of guitars.		Both of those two are pretty strong.  Pulling on the yoke by hand doesn't reveal much give.		But I needed three more for the last three guitars, which I hadn't originally planned on hanging...so I ordered these from Amazon with same day delivery.  They will do the job, but they're not as good as the other two.  First, although you can't see it in the picture, the way these work is that the yolk has a long threaded shaft that goes through the plastic spacer (the part that's shown touching the wood in the picture.  There is also a rubber washer-grommet thing that goes between the plastic spacer and the yoke.  After mounting the base to the wall, you put the washer and spacer on the threaded post and then thread that shaft into the metal thread insert that's pre-installed in the wood.  You tighten the yoke untill the rubber washer compresses enough that the yoke begins to tighten.  If you leave it loose enough that the yoke will automatically pivot to match an odd-shaped headstock (like a Telecaster), the whole thing feels pretty flimsy overall.  When you put the guitar in the hanger, the yoke will sag downward under its weight, and you can visibly see the yoke move...like a quarter inch, or more.  You can also see the spacer sliding against the wood base!  If you turn the yoke another turn or two, so that the rubber washer is more compressed and the whole thing is tighter, it does firm things up a bit, but everything still sags.  If you use them like this, the yoke won't pivot freely to match your headstock...so you either have to turn it by hand, or hang the same guitar in the same hanger all the time.  That's probably how most folks do it anyway, but I'll often move my guitars from one spot to another.  The thing is, BOTH of the other brands have a much thicker shaft, and feel a LOT more solid once installed, while being free to pivot and accommodate whatever guitar is hung from them.  In my case, I've hung my three lightest guitars (two accoustic and one semi-hollow electric) from these hangers.		Finally, the screws they include are too short!  The screws were two inch coarse-thread wood screws.  After you go through the wood base and your drywall, you'll have, at best, 3/4" of screw into the studs of your wall.  But remember, it's a wood screw with a long tapered tip...so the first 1/4" isn't holding much.  Also included with this stand are two drywall anchors...the E-Z anchor kind...white plastic with a deep screw thread that self-drill their way into the drywall and provide a hole for a smaller screw in the center.  This is just stupid...for one thing, if you're screwing into a stud in the wall, which you should be, these anchors won't work (and aren't necessary).  For another, while the ANCHOR itself is rated at some super high weight rating, it's the drywall itself you can't trust to hang a guitar!  No one in their right mind hangs an instrument from a hanger like this attached only to drywall.  So, bottom line?  Plan on finding some 2 1/2" or 3" wood screws to go along with these mounts, and please don't use the drywall anchors!  To be fair, the Hercules screws weren't long enough either, IMO, and both the Hercules and the On-Stage included cheap drywall anchors.  But again...you're crazy if you hang an expensive guitar from a hanger using only drywall anchors!
1,Poor quality... flicker and flash... Blue and green LEDs failed within months.
1,The carrying case is useless, since the Zoom Q3HD doesnt fit into it. Thats right, the camera for which this carrying case was supposedly designed doesnt fit. Kudos to the design team. Further, you cant put anything else in the carrying case, so youll still need a carrying case to hold the camera and its accessories. I use an old binocular case that has enough room for the camera (wrapped in a small hand towel for protection), AC adapter, and instruction manual. The tripod is rickety and useful only on a tabletopyoure far better off with a full-sized tripod. The only essential item in this package is the AC adapter. You can get that separately at a lower price:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Zoom-AD14-Power-Supply-for-Q3-H4N-and-R16/dp/B004BSN9PK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Zoom AD14 Power Supply for Q3, H4N and R16</a>. If you want a cable to run from the Q3HD to a television, you can also find that separately.
1,Been using Elixir polyweb on my acoustic electric.. Very mellow and balanced tone.	Thought I would try something different. Also the reviews were very positive on the daddario. I can't stand them. Sound very metallic and extremely noisy when fingering and moving from fret to fret. They are so noisy, the noise is more dominate than the playing or melody. The polyweb are mellow and have a softer feel. Waste of money for me. Will go back to the polyweb.
1,Kind of hard to tell from the pic, but the 2 bottom rests do not fold away, nor are they permanently affixed. I don't have time to assemble a guitar stand every time I play a gig. Additionally, the stand is not what I consider sturdy and when you have 2 guitars on it the heads touch each other. Poor design, in my opinion.
1,Recently had the opportunity to try out this new synthesizer. Not at all impressed! I compared it to the equally priced, somewhat equally featured Yamaha MOXF 6, and the two hardly belong in the same class. What Roland excels at (the same cheesy-ish sounds they've been putting onto boards in this range for several years now, some of which are pretty decent), Yamaha way more than makes up for in the true beauty of its sound quality. Not only that, but in trying to do something simple, like add real time release to the piano sounds...the FA wouldn't do it, Yamaha did it seamlessly. This all coming from someone who used to have a Roland, and traded it in, because it just seemed "cheap." I now have my new favorite workstation brands, at least in my experience: Korg and Yamaha.
1,I registered my TASCAM Teac Professional DP-004 Portable 4-Track Digital Pocketstudio April 8th, but still can't figure out how to use it.  I honestly don't know if the unit is any good or not, because I still can't get past playing their demo.  The instruction manual is SO BAD, that it is incomprehensible!
1,This were a bit thinner than expected.  They were hard to work with and didn't hold the tune very well.
1,Mine fell off the stand after some of the elastic bands snapped in its holder. I don't even know how it was possible or maybe a studio ghost did it but it ended up on the floor in pieces!		I hate that I know how these things are assembled because I had to re-assemble it and put it back together. It still works but I'm surprised it came apart so easily.		I guess it's the mystery of Behringer Quality it's hit or miss.		It did sound good though but had a HELL OF A LOT OF HUMMMM!
1,This unit runs extremely hot - over 110 degrees.  Over time, that's really damaging to electrical components.  The documentation packaged with the unit is extremely scanty.  My attempt to download more product documentation from the manufacturer's website resulted in multiple "page not available" error messages.
1,SUCKS , BROKE IN ONE DAY
1,Don't get me wrong, I love Marshall and sound wise this was a good amplifier, it also looks cool. That's why I gave the product a 2 instead of a cold 1. However, anything positive pretty much ends there. My problem isn't exactly that it's necessarily a horrible amplifier, but do not ever expect to play with a band with this amp. Whenever I practice with my band I can never hear myself, even turned up to full volume. I hear drums, bass, keyboard, and even my s***ty nearly broken PA system are all much superior to this. I really wish I could like this amp because it looks so cool and when I'm practicing alone it's fine but bring one other instrument in the mix and you'll surely be drowned out. If you are a beginning guitarist or do not plan to play with a band then this amp should be fine, but if you perform in a group especially if you plan to play gigs then this amp is not for you, Although I would wait to see if the price drops because even as a practice amp I would not price this at $400 maybe $200 max.
1,Pure crap. Two failed the first night. I threw them all away.
1,G string broke on first tune up didn't even get up to E.
1,This product is garbage. I bought two of them and I had to wait almost an entire month to get the second one in the mail. At firdt they sounded great, But in less than a month they started to crackle. I never use my speakers at full power. These were so loud I didn't have to use more than a quarter of what these speakers are suppose to handle. But they both blew out on me and on the same night. They were completely useless to me within the first two months after receiving them. I am a DJ/KJ for more than 15 years now. I have a Bose tower speaker for more than three years now that still sounds new. I have 4 JBL speakers that are over 7 years old and work great. I also have a pair of some generic brand 12in, speakers that have been with me since the year 2001 and they still sound great.	i try to get a hold of the company that makes these and guess what? No answer. No response to my voicemails. No response to my emails. Amazon couldn't help me get a hold of them either. I did buy a smart trade guarantee for both of these speakers so that is my next step. I do hope the company reads my review and finally gets a hold of me. I do not like writing bad reviews, but since they won't answer my calls, then maybe they can read about how crappy their products are. Or maybe they already know this and that's why they won't respond.
1,counter intuitive, and HUGE.  takes up way too much real estate on my board and not happy with it's core functionality.
1,Didn't work..
1,There are positives to Moongel, but I'm going to disperse with the main negative first.  In recent years Moongel seems to have changed their formula and the pads now come out of the package fused together, nearly impossible to separate.  I've tried soap, water, oil... none of them budging the united blob that is Moongel apart.  Although it's probably not worth the bother, I did find one method that worked:  run hot water over the Moongel.  Grab two ends, where you would normally tear them apart, and run the water in the middle as you slowly pull the pieces apart.	The positives: I've been using Moongel for 15 years - it lasts forever, easy to wash and reuse, and most importantly it's the best method hands down that I have found to dampen a snare drum or tom.  Sounds way better than tape or O Rings or internal dampers.  But this newer formula is so frustrating to tear apart that I can't give it a good review.  Possibly worth a try in desperation, but I've also read people have had success buying window clings and cutting them up to use as dampeners (not a method I've tried) so if that does work I can't heartily recommend toiling over these to make them work.
1,Does not get tall enough for a standing student over 5' 5". Also, the bar which you adjust for height has deteriorated very quickly and it looks terrible. I anticipate it not to last another year.
1,Well, let's just say it is a brilliantly designed concept, but cheap execution hurts it badly. Very sturdy and well thought out. Only problem is whoever made it in China mixed up the screw holes so that if you wish to use the non-Metric side of it, not happening. Some of the screws will fit some of the holes, but none of the screws will fit ALL of the holes. Tried repeatedly to discuss this with a person at Samson but all they were interested in was photos of my 'problem'. What, you will believe me after I send you a photo of a screw one thread into a hole???  After a second email and phone call they promised to 'get back to me'. Still sitting here holding my breath.  I will get this to work, but without help from Samson. Huge waste of time!
1,Right out of the box this little practice amp has had issues. It's okay to leave in my practice room and use for very low volume when learning songs but the speaker can't handle the amps power. Lots of distorted rattling at less than half volume making it useless for anything other than low volume.
1,This was my second Behringer pedal purchase.  My other is the echo machine.  I absolutely loved that one so I figured this would be a sure-shot.  I'm not even writing this to sound funny - when I plugged it in and plucked the string it sounded like my amp was flatulating.  I figured maybe something needed adjusted so I messed with the different settings and what have you.  The sound you get from this can't even be considered music.  It like, attempts to drop what you're playing an octave and another octave lower, but it's like the signal can't get through properly or something.  No kidding, it sounds like someone is farting through your amplifier.  I realize it's a 25 dollar pedal and you shouldn't expect much, but this doesn't function.  Save your money and buy something worthwhile.  And shame on you Behringer, I really liked your other stuff.  I'll probably think twice before purchasing another.
1,I should have looked at the reviews, if I could give this pick holder negative stars I wouldThe pick holder will hold up to 5 .70mm picks, if you add a 6th pick and it comes apart, and it is difficult to get the picks in or out.
1,It's a decent lightweight amp.  I bought it less than five months ago and the power light has already burnt out.  Also the Tolurone surface is mottled.  I would like to like this amp, sars.
1,This device is very well made, solid as steel and sexy looking. However, it claims to making tuning drums quick and convenient, and with that I'm at a loss. I play a large drum kit with mountable tom toms and bought this so that I could tune on the fly, perhaps just before a gig; from what I read, that's what it seemed to be for. The problem is the drum must lie flat so that you can rest this device on the batter surface. Thus, you must dismount each drum for tuning.		I tried it on a snare drum for which I'd just purchased a new head. I finger tightened each lug, as instructed, and then tightened one with a key just a couple spins. Oddly, the device registered 68 for that lug, and all the others. As I'd tighten one, the others would show the same tension. I'm not saying the device is defective, I just didn't understand how to make it work for me, and the very brief instruction paper was of very little value (to me).		Perhaps a seasoned pro could find value in this, or someone playing always level drums, like timpani's. I am much better off just tuning by ear, lug by lug, with all drums mounted and ready to play. So again, nothing against Drumdial or this tuner, but I do challenge their claim of 'quick' tuning, and also they really should have more detailed instructions.
1,GOOD:	Great sounding effects for the most part.  No more tap-dancing.  MIDI control of amp channel switching is a definite plus.		BAD:	Sorry folks but if you think this doesn't change your tone then get down at ear level with your speaker/cabinet and listen close, then completely pull it out of the chain and go direct and listen close.  You can hear the digital conversion.  It's a slight fizzy sound.  Recording-wise you may not notice as we all listen in digital nowadays anyway.  And maybe you wouldn't hear it with a loud rock band either but on your own or in your sound guy's ears, it WILL change your tone in a slightly unpleasant way.  For Line 6 to label this as "true bypass" is almost a marketing gimmick.  Yes, with all the pedals off and the global settings in "true bypass" your tone will be unaffected (with the M13 in front of amp only).  However, soon as you activate any effect/pedal the unit routes all signal to digital conversion.  If you use the four cable method like I do then you can't switch off the true bypass at all and are now 100% digital conversion (due to no true bypass in effects loop of M13).		Returned.
1,I really liked this processor in the beginning, but after about a month of owning it, it started to flake out.  I'd be playing for about 10-15 minutes or so and then it would just completely crap out on me -- like lose 90% of everything (gain, effects, volume, etc).  I checked all of my cables to ensure that wasn't the problem, ensure all of the line out settings were correct, etc.  It sucks.  I really loved the thing when it worked, but it's essentially unusable now.  I simply can't count on it to work properly.
1,Tried to give this oil a chance but I couldn't use it. It kept making my valves stick and get all clunky. I washed off all the other oil from my valves and trumpet I used before I started using this Ultra Pure oil, but after 2 weeks with it, its just not so good. Oh well. Going back to Blue Juice...
1,Kind of a leave green junk on your hands too fat too thin useless item I never use?  Hey we've all done it
1,This pedal is decent, but not what I thought it was. It has a good crunch tone, but is very lacking for the price. I really wish I hadn't bought it, and I plan on selling it soon.
1,Almost everyone of them were defective and or noisy
1,I read a bunch of reviews recommending this monitor.  Ordered two: both were DOA.  Returned them & ordered two more.  One worked, the other took two months to fail.  Called KRK repair.  "[KRK] does not reimburse for shipping."  After experiencing a 75% failure rate (in this case), and losing the cost for shipping and time, I realize the value of good service.  I don't believe warranty service should cost the customer, and I don't recommend these speakers, or anything else by KRK.	The sound?  Meh.  I got more bass response (and more control options) out of a pair of M-Audio BX-8s.  The KRKs have been a lousy experience.
1,The only reason I'm not giving this one star is that I didn't expect much for such a low cost pedal. I got this for one of my guitar players so he could use it to switch between clean tones and distortion at our rental practice space before he gets the money to buy a halfstack and decent sounding pedals. We have a punk ska band (think suicide machines, sublime) and need to switch a lot in all our songs. I thought this pedal would get us by someway in the meanwhile. NOPE. This pedal sucks your guitar's tone, and you have to turn the knobs all the way to get anything going, and its not a pleasant sound either way. AVOID.
1,did not work at all. very dissappointing. tried every conceivable configuration to no avail. be very careful.had to send back.
1,In-ear silicone piece came unglued in my ear. Doctor visit required to remove it. Never again
1,The guitar I received was unplayable.  The action was so high that merely fretting a chord pulled the instrument out of tune.  The intonation on the lower strings was way off.  I returned it.
1,I would give this more stars, but at this moment my MXL MT001 Hard Mount for my MXL USB.006 microphone is unusable, and I had to purchase a new&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/MXL-MT-001-MT001-Hard-Mount/dp/B00119QDPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">MXL MT-001 MT001 Hard Mount</a>&nbsp;because the 5/8" to 3/8" adapter on this stand is STUCK in the female part of the connection and cannot be removed.		After calling Marshall's tech support and asking how I can remove the adapter, they asked if there were "notches" on either side of the adapter to use a large screwdriver, and THERE ARE NOT.  Apparently a new adapter can be purchased from Amazon with this feature (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Etubby-5-8-Inch-Male-to-3-8-Inch-Female-Mic-Thread-Screw-Adapter-for-Microphone-Stand-2-Pack/dp/B01EKS0H1O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Etubby 5/8-Inch Male to 3/8-Inch Female Mic Thread Screw Adapter for Microphone Stand- 2 Pack</a>).		SO MY ADVICE IF YOU PURCHASE THIS...it is a nice little stand, and I have none of the problems listed by other one-star reviewers.  However, IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU DON'T SCREW YOUR MICROPHONE'S ADAPTER TIGHTLY...there is a little silver knurled ring that needs to be used instead.  Screw the microphone on, but not all the way, then use the silver ring to tighten the connection.  Maybe this is something musicians know, but I'm just making instructional videos and I'm not an audio professional...I didn't know that there is a special trick to this.		You might also purchase some of the slotted adapters (link above) and replace the one included with the stand.
1,Awful quality - the paint in the inset letters was pooled and bleeding outside the lines - the washer itself was sharp and poorly finished - couldn't even flip it over and use the back face as it has registration/manufacturing marks on the back. Useless.
1,fenders better
1,only two wire and power is shorted to ground not a good idea to use this
1,I'm not sure if this is a frequent problem with NEEWER but I got an arm from them to hold my mic and it didn't work very well either. I grabbed this thing for a NEEWER arm and a ATR2100 microphone. I mounted it to the arm but it would not hold it's position, it would slowly creep back down regardless of how I bent it. I can't say that it even did a great job of stopping plosives either, but I didn't get to test it much since it's in my closet now. I ended up going with a standard foam ball which did a much better job.		I think this thing would be fine if the arm would stay where you put it, but hard bends simply unbend and it won't stay put.
1,Mine didn't come with the holder for larger condenser mics. Only worked for stage mics...kinda defeats the purpose of having it attach to your desk.
1,~These bags would be great for small drums but look out for the zipper easily breaking after first use....I do not recommend this product.....
1,I expected more for the price, considered returning it, but ended up keeping it.  It is ok, but I wouldn't recommend it.  There are other tools that cost less and work much more efficiently.
1,With a tenor ukulele, the strap is OK if you are holding your ukulele relatively level. Raise the neck a little and the strap slips off the body of the ukulele and onto the neck. I'm always afraid that it will come loose or damage the sound hole. I've stopped using it for that reason.
1,I should have realized that, given the low price, these were low quality instruments. Some of the reeds did not produce sound, for instance. Igifted them to my grandkids because they are really more toy-like.
1,I like this unit a lot if it would only work! This is review 2 from 2018: Three strikes your out. I would never buy another TC Electronic product ever again. After about 6 months the first unit started to distort the vocal until I rebooted the unit. Would be OK for awhile then start up again. I sent it back to TC Electronic. They sent a new unit, it was turning the effect on and off without hitting the button. Sent that back. Now I have a 3rd unit and it is exhibiting the same issue as the 1st. Distortion comes out of the speakers when you sing into the mic. I give up. This was review 1 from 2017: Sonically I like it a lot, but I am a professional sound person and I know how to adjust it, I have heard others mis-adjust this with too much effect. It needs to be subtle and it sounds great. Thick. That said I have been very happy with it until it started making static noises through the microphone output. When I power down and back up its good for awhile, maybe a few days. But sooner or later I get the static back. So I am sending this in for warranty and TC Electronic is good for 3 years, pretty good I think.
1,The pick arrived in a box large enough to hold about 1000 of them...so much for "go green". Though listed as large, it was much to small. It was also split. I am just to busy to return it.
1,Nicely built but the bottom of the stand where the guitar sits isn't a fixed seat. It swivels making it difficult to put your guitar back and having it seat well the first time.
1,Oh dear.		What a disappointment.	I thought I had thoroughly researched this guitar, taking advice from every review I could find. Either the reviewers have never played anything decent or they had some sort of financial gain in the offing, like commission.	The guitar arrived on time, roughly 5 pm, by 5.30 pm I was downloading the return label, yes it is that bad. Below I will just touch upon the worst points of this......I'm even having trouble calling it an instrument.		The 'Setup' was appalling, the intonation was so far out I reckon my 5 year old grandson must have tweaked it.	The Action was so high the thing was almost unplayable.	When plugged into the amp, the middle and bridge pickups emitted a swirling white noise through the speakers. Thinking this may my proximity to the amp my lead allowed me to leave the room and walk down the hall, no change.	I did glean from the reviews that the guitar is heavy but they didn't mention the all the weight is in the lower body of the guitar, thus the centre of gravity is so far away that the guitar is not balanced. So if like me you play sitting with the guitar on your right knee (or left if that way inclined), take your left hand off of the fretboard and the guitar slips off heading for the ground. If also like me you need all the help you can get with fingering on the fretboard the last thing you need to have a tight hold on the guitar to stop it capsizing.	Don't get me wrong this a beautiful guitar to look at but in this case beauty is certainly only skin deep.	I hope sincerely that if you purchase one of these things it pleases you but I was appalled.		I've been trying for some time now to replace my Ibanez Artcore but I still haven't found anything to touch it for quality of sound and manufacture, so maybe lower your sights and try one, see if I'm right.
1,Not very strong clippers, and they immediately got nicked upon the first use on guitar strings.  I didn't know that they were Spring clippers so they remain in the open position all the time.  Just get some plier wire cutters.
1,These are really comfortable on your fingers. Especially if you like to play a lot.  They produce a warm sound so if your guitar is already rather warm you may not like them.  My guitar is fairly bright so these sound great on it.  The only issue is they do not last long at all.  Ive only been using them for about a month and Im about to put my third set on.  On the first the high E string snapped in about 4 days.  On the second set the G string broke after 2 weeks.  I wouldnt rely on these for any gigging you might do.  There is most definitely a large loss of durability in exchange for comfort.  You have to decide if thats worth it to you.
1,Don't waste your money. Makes it sound really strange.
1,The amplifier I received is so noisy with radio interference that it is unusable. The radio interference and buzzing is honestly as loud as the guitar. I used the same cable and the same guitar in four different amplifiers in the same location just to rule out the possibility that my guitar or the cable were at fault, and this was the only amp that had a problem. Even my similarly priced amplifiers do not sound like this. Maybe it's just mine that's defective, but I would not risk buying another one of these.
1,Do not buy these! They do not look like the picture. Instead of a mother of pearl greenish yellow, they are grey. Flat grey plastic. They are incredibly ugly and not at all like the picture shows. These will be going back for a refund.
1,This feels like one of those products that someone designed, but never bothered to actually use. It looks and feels like a rawhide boot lace. Very stiff and hard. I applied some leather conditioner and tried working it in by hand, thinking it would be better after it was broke in a little bit, but no. While it did soften up a little, it became a shedding mess (like others mentioned). The "blasted" texture that appears to be glued on, balled up and flaked off such that it looks absolutely awful. It's also impregnated with a reddish colored dye that will run and get everywhere if you perspire. I imagine it's there to color the thing so it looks less like the sole of a shoe and more like a quality leather strap...which it really isn't. A few reviewers used words like "buttery soft" and "fine piece of jewelry", but the one I got is far from fine or buttery. Maybe I got a bad one that was left out on a street somewhere in the blazing sun for a few months, but even then, it's a glued together piece of rawhide, nothing fine or quality about it.
1,no good
1,Did not fit my classical guitar properly.
1,Amazing at first but after not playing for 3 weeks in my case they got rusted really bad...might go back to elixirs or other strings that won't rust as fast.
1,I was willing to give it a try	but	It knocks all the low frequencies out of my guitar signal	this is a terrible and unforgivable oversight.	Now I need to spend more money to get one that works.	Sorry, Behringer some of your stuff is great	but not this one
1,The cork was so excessively thick that it took me over and hour to finally sand it down to where I could force it into the clarinet with plenty of grease.	there is absolutely no excuse for such shoddy manufacturing.  I will purchase another brand with my next purchase!  NO MORE RICO MOUTHPIECES!
1,Complete waste of money.  You can get one for $15 of the same cruddy quality - not even useful for making music.  It's basically a toddler's strumming toy.  It's 100% plastic, not counting the strings.  Buzzing all over the fretboard.  If you want a toy, amazon has them for $15.		If you want something that can actually play a song, pay a little more for the Lauren LA30N.  It's not that much of a step up but it can get the job done for someone who wants to learn to play and is younger than say 7yrs.  The nylon strings will require repetitive retuning.		For a more serious student, you should move up to a 3/4 size guitar.  Yamaha is just one brand that is available here but it's >$100.  There is really no option for a sub $100 student guitar.
1,Would probably be a good amp, but it arrived with a cracked speaker and I had to return it.
1,says it will do/fit a 12 string...... not the simon patrick 12 string made in canada...... the 12 string dwarfs the capo...... i need a large lengthy capo to play certain songs written with a capo..... always check for 12 and 6 on capo package as well as D shape neck vs other neck line figures..... will return...too pricy to have for non useable !!!
1,Several items broken upon arrival. The fix was me gigging it up and not their fix. Warranty what warranty? Spend your money elsewhere. Very dissatisfied and disappointing to say the least. I've gotten better deals and service off Craigslist
1,Very cheap and is not comfortable to wear
1,A TOY
1,crap waste of money
1,I must have got a bad one. This thing has many good reviews, yet mine simply does not work at all. It did once or twice. It lights up but its like it thinks while the guitar is ringing, then it displays nothing. I changed battery but there was no change. I need a reliable tuner. This  didn't work for me.
1,EDIT:  3/14/2013		All good things must come to an end.  Kyser no longer donates money to the Komen foundation, the lifetime warranty has been shortened to a 1 year warranty, Kyser's latest products do not say, "Made in USA" on them, and all that good mojo has pretty much been sold up the river trying to squeeze a couple more pennies out of their customers...		For about eleven dollars LESS, you can buy a high quality Kyser knock-off, right here on Amazon, and put the extra money into your own pocket instead of into the hands of some greedy MBA types who ruined what used to be a great American product.		ORIGINAL REVIEW:		For every pink capo sold, Kyser donates a dollar to the Susan G. Komen foundation.  Also, Kyser capos are made in the USA by Americans.  A good product, a good cause, a good company, and good mojo...  And what better way to impress the ladies!?  ;-)  Charity starts at HOME!
1,I pulled this out of my gadget bag after not having used it for a couple of years, to discover the entire plastic surface is decayed and is now sticky goop that comes off on my fingers.  I discovered that the goop is the red surface material, and that I could wipe it off with alcohol, getting down to the bare grey plastic underneath.  Perhaps it is just the red color material, and won't happen with the other colors, but who knows.  There's no excuse for this choice of synthetic material.
1,Like a previous reviewer wrote, you get what you pay for.	Was the price low? Sure.	Did it get delivered promptly? Of course.	Will it stop your axe from falling on the floor? Yes.	Is it made of leather? HELLLLLL no!
1,Had nothing but problems trying to install the drivers for this on my windows 10 laptop
1,Brilliant idea - poorly executed.  The combination of an M/S mic and "Raw" mode which allows recording without matrixing (each capsule on a separate channel) could have been a breakthrough for documentary sound but not in this iteration.  What might have been was the ability to record what the mic is pointed at on one channel and what is happening to the sides on the second channel.  Used as separate channels instead of matrixing the two into a stereo channel would free the cameraperson (or sound person) from always having to point at the person talking when it is often the person listening that is more compelling.  You can do this with pro M/S mics but it's cumbersome.  The problem with the SSH-6 is that the mid capsule is so sensitive to contact noise you can't touch the recorder, even to adjust gain, without wrecking the audio.  Forget about trying to use it in a hand-held documentary situation.  The "dead cat" windscreen also fails.  It is so loose that any movement of the mic causes substantial contact noise.
1,I have two guitars, and Ovation Celebrity and a small travel guitar called a Montana made by Kaman.  The Chord Buddy did not fit either one!  I am a very mechanically inclined person, and tried for quite a while to make the Chord Buddy work.  Apparently, it fits "most" guitars--so be careful!  Maybe a quick call to the manufacturer will help.  They would be smart to track the guitars it does not work on.  I think it's a great idea, and I'm disappointed that it would not work for me.
1,Is a good product thanks
1,As I mentioned in another strap review I'm always on the look out for a great new comfy bass strap.	This one seemed pretty good, so I ordered it. Eh...It's ok. It's comfy but nothing special.	I did notice it doesn't look as it does in the pic though. Similar but doesn't have the the planet waves logo/pick holder. I paied less than $20 for this. So I'm not returning it lol. I'll most likely will keep it as a backup strap or just give it to someone who needs a decent strap.	All in all...I don't really recommend  buying this.	But I do recommend Mono Betty Straps :)
1,a total ripoff for $7. Its like 10 cents of injection molded (poorly btw) plastic. Makes bass look cheaper. Cheap screws, cheap light plastic.
1,Well my wife bought these for me for Xmas... At first I thought they were real drum sticks. They are NOT! They are the shape of sticks but, as others have put it they flex, vibrate really, really bad, you cannot just turn them on and off. But..... the worst is the sound. Cymbals sound awful and there is no noise from drum hits themselves. Great for kids to mess with in the dark. I don't really know what to do with them, give them to a kid I suppose. I do play tomorrow night for a New Years party. We do a slow song I think I will use them on it and maybe throw them into the crowd?		I think the manufacturer should say, toy sticks or something....		Mike
1,I could have gotten a better case for this price.  It is unacceptable, cheap garbage.  When I tried to open the inner compartment where the neck rests, the little tab lifted off like it wasn't attached.  The outer fabric is pulled away from the inner foam at the waist, the zippers catch at every grommet.  I hate it.  Will never purchase another item that has the ProRockGear name on it.
1,The bag appears to be similar to free bags you occasionally find as advertising promotions that aren't really designed to last much longer than getting stuff home. I'm not sure why they went to the trouble of sewing up some kind of paper product and didn't at least use some kind of canvas or duck. Even though I got this for about $10, it wasn't really worth paying anything for.		Maybe they changed materials and those who find it wonderful actually got something worth buying.
1,This is the worst product I ever ordered online. The product made the situation worse. It made more noise than it was without it. I took it out and threw it away and the sound of instrument was much better.
1,The XLR output does not work. The microphones are not sensitive enough.
1,I'll chalk this up to "the one that got through quality control." It arrived disassembled and even after putting it together, it didn't accept a quarter inch jack. It wouldn't go all the way in and never would lock in place. But Amazon gave me a instant refund.
1,piece of junk. go to your local hardware store first
1,Dunlops are the best in my opinion. Try a variety and decide for yourself. All thumbs are a little different
1,Nice picks just not right for me...
1,I should have heeded the one star reviews.  This did not fit my Goetz style endpin and looked as though it was intended to stay on via the honor system.  I knew that it isn't threaded, but I thought that there would be SOME snugness.  Nope.  It would not have stayed on if I'd lifted the bass into playing position.  Think about it-it claims to fit a 10-12mm endpin.  That means that to fit a 12, it would be really loose on a 10.  Indeed it is.  I wanted to give it a shot before ordering the absurdly expensive real one elsewhere.  Live and learn.
1,I had high hopes for this keyboard, but after unboxing, setting up and playing two songs, I reboxed it and sent it back. I've played the piano for over 45 years and have played everything from a spinet to a grand. My complaints about the Alesis are the touch, which felt too hard and plasticky, almost like the toy keyboards you give a child, and the lack of sustain. Those were the deal breakers for me - the odd touch and lack of sustain. I have owned several keyboards - two Ensoniqs and one Yamaha P200. While the Yamaha P255, is considerably more than this Alesis, I placed my order and know I will love it. My only other complaint, and this would not have been a deal breaker, but you cannot individually control the volume of the voices. For instance, I like to layer piano with strings, with piano being louder than the strings. On every keyboard I've played, this was a feature that was adjustable. On the Alesis, it's not. It's one volume for all voices.		I think this keyboard would be fine for someone just starting out, but for someone whose played for years, I just don't think it's a good fit - at least it wasn't for me.
1,Doesn't hold sm58 well
1,I bought this exact power supply - Donner DPA-1 with 5 leads / 5  way daisy chain		1 star rating: didn't power anything - no power from it at all		Extension cable I used, I use everyday, the wall outlet I also use everyday along with the same extension cable - plug in THIS power supply and no power available		Right now set up for a return eBay - Donner DPA-1		yikes - waste of time and money!		ALSO: you should consider NOISE created by inexpensive "daisy chain" power supplies - which do exist - there is a reason why (far more) expensive power supplies exist!  do your homework, look elsewhere.
1,I have over 120 guitars in my collection, and had high hopes for this one, but the wide range pickups	let me down big time.  These pickups are supposed to run in the 10K ohm/5H range, so should be a bit above	the medium output humbucker pickups; THEY ARE NOT!	Admittedly, I like a hot pickup, and had never tried the wide ranges before, so partly my bad.	I rarely return a guitar, and this is only the 3rd or 4th in the past 10 years of collecting guitars.	I chose this guitar over the Blacktop, as it's reviews were worse than the 72 which had mixed reviews itself	mostly centering around the muddy pickups, while the Blacktop bad reviews were around workmanship issues.	While the 72 was not for me, I have been having good luck with the Fender FSR ash guitars, and have never returned	one of their amps.
1,It's a good slide, but I prefer the Medium size. It fits perfectly on my little finger which is the finger I wear it on. Amazon doesn't carry the Medium size, so I got one from Music 123 (they carry all of the sizes). I also tried the small one , but that was too small.		I love the clay interior, it's very comfortable. And the glaze on the outside produces very warm, buttery tones.
1,Bought these hoping for a cheap solution...  WOW Cheap they are.  Right out of the box all 5 of them had transformer buzz.  I immediately returned them and purchased&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Whirlwind-Director-Passive-Direct-Boxes/dp/B0002DUQ7C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Whirlwind Director Passive Direct Boxes.</a>		DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!  As with ALL audio gear you get what you pay for. If you play with a group all your gonna do is upset everyone else with this low grade gear.		I have over 18 years of professional audio experience and knew better. I was trying to help my church save some money, in the end we ended up buying quality and couldn't be happier.
1,They tend to fall off easily for me and my strat
1,This is great design.  But the thing just doesnt work very well.  The screen goes blank quite a bit when tuning, as if it doesnt pick up the sound very well.  It just seems flakey. It takes too long to tune because you have to fiddle with it so much to get it to work.  I have a snark that works so much better than this one.  but this one is very small and you can keep it on the back of your headstock without anyone noticing it. The snark is quite a bit larger.  maybe 3 to 5 times larger.  If it worked reliably, it would be the top clip on tuner.  but it doesnt.
1,Bent neck. Does not play.
1,My ProFX8 purchased from Amazon in 2015 was poorly built. Channel 5/6 now makes a loud, robotic drone and is unusable.	This thing literally has an hour or two of use on it and is always stored in the padded Mackie case I got for it.	What the hell is the point in buying the special protective case if this thing dies on its own? Blerg.	So this is more like a fx6 now? Lame. I've contacted Mackie support and I'll change my review if they make it right.
1,I couldn't get the integrated power supply system to stop humming, it was pretty bad and the blue LED status light is pretty bright too (nothing a little tape can't fix though). I'm pretty disappointed, wasn't expecting a perfect setup but the power supply just isn't usable. The board itself is usable but I'm using a One-spot power system.
1,I am a semi-pro musician.  I play a hybrid finger-style using a flat-pick and steel finger picks.  My primary guitar is a 1982 Taylor 555.  I found these strings to be utterly disappointing. Dull sounding with a very stiff and unresponsive feel.  For "light" gauge strings, they required an awful lot of torque to get them up to concert pitch.  So much so that it raised the action noticeably.  If my Taylor had been strung with these strings when I was shopping for a 12-String, I would have passed this outstanding guitar over.
1,Great features but hard to hear 16th notes. The cheaper blue Korg has great sound but breaks easily. Still searching  ((
1,Mine stopped working after 1 week. Then I bought a $9.99 coil cord on Amazon again and I've had that for 2 years now. Spend no more than $15 on guitar cords. They are the same.
1,This is a simple product and fairly easy to setup/use.	But, one of the washers was severely bent, quality seems to be lacking, sadly.
1,The 1/4" connector will not work with Neutrix connectors. I have to pull the connector half-way out to make it work and that is a balancing act.
1,I've had this pedal about 6 months and actually stepped on it maybe 25 times. The last time I stepped on it the switch broke. I mean it doesn't turn the effect on and off anymore. From what I read online there really is no fix for this since the switch is attached to a circuit board. I also read that TC Electronic pedals are known for these bad switches. This switch is what is known as a hard switch. It clicks really hard when stepped on. There are some of their pedals, it seems, that now have a "soft" switch.  I will never know that because I won't buy another TC pedal. I also read that TC is not helpful when it comes to warranty claims. They want you to return the pedal, at your cost, and instead of fixing the pedal they just send another one and it may have the same cheap switch. No thanks. There are many other pedals as good, if not better, than this one to choose from.
1,Arrived scratched and with a broken solder point. Does not fit the standard Fender pickguard notch.  I won't use this but it's not worth the hassle to return.  This would be an alright option for a super cheap partscaster as long as you don't mind rewiring it and taking a dremel to your pickguard.
1,It's cheap and it looks it. Tortoise is an applique complete with air bubbles, and even brand new it peels off.
1,Just about to learn to play guitar, this was my motivation since I'm a Mustaine fan and this isn't the cheapest starter guitar. Can't wait until Wednesday when it arrives.		Update...not only did a much less expensive guitar arrive due to some sort of botched shipping error but the wrong one not only arrived in just a guitar box looked like it was thrown off a large mountain and fell for a good 10 minutes straight. Then after opening the guitar shipping box the wrong guitar was in (the guitar style James Hetfield plays) which was $179.00 brand new. The condition of the guitar was worse than the box so immediately sent it back. I've always had a great experience with Amazon but this turned into a fiasco. I contacted Amazon about this the same day and for over 2 hours the 1st day (28 minutes on hold then disconnected) nothing was accomplished. The next day I called back, asked for a US agent, explained everything again for another hour. He said he would call me back by 5PM last Wednesday or Thursday. Well it's about noon Saturday and still no calls. It could have been if anything could go wrong it could with this order. Very bummed but still a loyal Amazon customer.
1,All fizzle no sizzle
1,I thought I was would love this strap due to me having a swamp ash bass and reading many reviews on it. The thickness bought an extreme discomfort within sec. It came this morning and I'll be shipping back out for the 2.5"
1,Pretty thin and jangly. I threw it out
1,Great starter kit. Comes with booklet two CDs abit hard to follow and the ukulele was difficult to tune. And goes out of tune every now and then ok more like always goes out of tune. It's small and sounds weird almost feels like I got a beginners course on the uke with a toy.
1,It died after 3 days.  Dissatisfied
1,The sound is very muffled and sounds nothing like a vintage microphone. I had to turn the volume all the way up to hear it through my PA system. It looks good although it is made of plastic. The only thing I could possibly use this for is a prop in pictures or video. It's possible the microphone I received has a defect. Not sure.
1,I purchased one of these from Guitar Center with a gift card I was given. However, I wanted to write a review here since reviews of this item are hard to find right now.		The feature set of the Graphite 49 looks great, but unfortunately, the build quality leaves a lot to be desired. I wasn't even able to turn the controller on because when I received it, there were several slabs of metal banging around inside of the box. When I removed the controller from the box, I could hear something loose inside of the unit banging around inside when I tilted the keyboard from side to side. Closer examination revealed just what this was. In order to provide the feeling of a semi-weighted key bed, Samson glues a metal (pot metal) bar under each key. The adhesive they use doesn't stick to the plastic well, so several of these had fallen off from the underside of they keys, and at least one had somehow found its way inside of the keyboard case during shipping.		I've bought Samson gear before and have been pleased with it. I own a Zoom R16 and I love it. I can only surmise that Samson took this route in order to keep costs down, but it's shoddy manufacturing and I wouldn't trust it to a keyboard that you plan on gigging with. I took mine back to GC and bought an Axiom 61 instead. It's a far superior unit in construction and in the feel of the key bed.		Hope that helps other prospective buyers. Sorry, Samson, but I have to call it like I see it.
1,When I pay $14 for a set of strings, I expect them to be way better that a $6 set.  Sadly, ELIXER is falling down in their quality control.  This most recent set of strings I bought sounded like a 6 month old set of six dollar strings as soon as I put them on the guitar.  I'm willing to pay the extra for strings that sound bell-clear AND stay that way for at least a month or two afterwards.  This is the second set of bad strings I've gotten from ELIXER.  I bought a set of "POLYWEB" strings, thinking they'd be better.  They were "dead-on-arrival" as well.  Maybe that's the intention - a 'duller' sound?  I don't know.  But "NANOWEB" have always been bell-clear and bright.  Not this time.  Let's see if I actually get a refund or credit.  Otherwise, I'm done with ELIXER.  I certainly cannot return them now that they've been put on the guitar and trimmed.
1,The DMC100 clips are ok. They are very easy to break.  The design is flaud. The bottom part of the clip that attaches to the drum rim is a hard plastic material that is all one piece and is not made to give(flex). I don't see the point of it having a tension spring since it can't expand or compress. Unless you own the Samson drum mic set that uses these clips, then purchase at your own risk.
1,great set but could get better for the same price, different brand.
1,Why the **** are CRUCIAL items like the AC adapter part of an add-on "accessory" package???  I could care less about the silly tripod and component cable, but the mini HDMI and the power cable are CRITICAL to the functionaity of the camera!!  That is the only thing that I didn't like about my Zoom Q3HD.		I purchased a 16GB SD card and tripod last weekend in order to record my band performing at an outdoor gig, and I suspect that the batteries that I had in there were "flaky" at best, because the camera would shut off after 20 minutes, leaving a corrupted file on the SD card.  An AC adaptor would have solved that problem right away.		Needless to say, my band and I were not happy, since it was a very good show and I bought the camera specifically for us to review our gigs and critique ourselves.
1,I really wanted these to work so I wouldn't have the hassle of a guitar cable, but the sound quality was poor, but the worst part was the constant noise you can hear over your amp when not playing.  Not worth the money.
