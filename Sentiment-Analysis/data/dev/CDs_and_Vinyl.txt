0,One Of There Best Albums Really Love The Title Track!
0,What memories. Will take a very long time to listen to all 25 CD's that I ordered to get the entire set. Looking forward to hearing them though and "remembering when". Thank you!
0,New is a return to form for McCartney, His last few albums since Driving Rain have left me a be it flat. But on the first listen to New the album rocks in a true McCartney fashion. I would not agree with some people that it is a return to a Beatles sound but it is more of return to Wings sound to me. I picked up the deluxe edition of it. The deluxe edition is worth the few extra dollars you pay for it. It comes in a nice trifold digipak design. Inside the first flap is nice booklet with pictures and notes about the album and a plastic concert style laminate . inside the center flap is 6 3x5 photos of Macca in concert and the third flap is the CD the most important bonus this CD comes with two extra tracks that are not on the regular version. Overall it is nice set and worth the few extra dollar for the deluxe edition. I would recommend this CD to anyone that likes McCartney and would suggest you get the deluxe edition for the extra two tracks!
0,This is a great album!  REO is at their best!
0,I first saw this fellow on American Idol and was my favorite from the start. I love his music.... all of it!
0,it's a great album
0,What a great album. Miles first effort on the Columbia label. Listened to this one with my mother and her boyfriend while having a few drinks one night. We really got into the music and talked about the legend that is Miles Davis. Other users here have said that the newer CD remasters of Miles Davis albums sound better than the old ones not sure why on every release i think better remastering techniques and technology have allowed for better digital conversions over the years. This 2 CD set sounds great.
0,If you are open-minded about music...meaning you enjoy many different types of genres this will be another one of those albums that you will rarely skip a track. U.S.A...specifically Los Angeles was overdue on a talented music band...not anymore.
0,It's a mix of other albums, but it has very good songs. I love the way she sings, specially when she sings alone.
0,Excellent recording and great songs (Blues).
0,This has to be my favorite Hendrix album.  The material is all fresh, all original, and is really all Jimi.  Unlike the material on "Are You Experienced" and "Electric Ladyland," every song was written by Jimi Hendrix.  The stuff is also very short, and I think that that makes it much more enjoyable.  I don't care how much you praise "Voodoo Chile" for its awesome bluesy-whatever, it's still far too long for my tastes (although I do enjoy the riff at the very end).		Although this album was apparently rushed, it really doesn't leave the impression of having been composed or recorded in such a manner.  Many of the tunes seem to be very laid-back, and there really aren't any really rockin' tunes like a "Purple Haze" or an "All Along the Watchtower" and that's what makes it one of those albums that you can really play anytime (if you like the Experience's music that much).  I also think that that's why most people forget about "Axis" when they think of Jimi and the Experience -- there aren't any popular tunes on it, so it must have been really bad.  It's actually a very good album that has a lot to say about Hendrix and his music if you give it a chance.		If you consider yourself to be any kind of Hendrix fan, there's really no excuse for not owning this.  And if you've listened to a lot of Hendrix music before but really aren't sure you'll enjoy this one, buy it anyway.  I was extremely unsure myself about this one and didn't think I'd enjoy it, but it quickly became my favorite.  Take my word for it and purchase this album.
0,listen people.... the three songs that are on the zz top box set YOU MAKE ME SHAKE, JOE BLUES AND CRIMSON WITCH, are kick a**. one reviwer said he wouldn't recommend 60's psych to zz top fans, well.. i love zz top and 60's psych, and i would buy this album. another reviwer mr. sandstrom says this album was poorly executed and has a heavy hendrix fixation. look.. as much as i love hendrix, he's NOT the only guitar player that has ever walked this earth AND, mr. gibbons has not changed his style of playing since this time till now. the point bein'.. everybody borrows from somebody.. even hendrix for as great as he was. nuff said.
0,Don't let the stupid title and the stupid cover put you off on what is probably the best music story of the year, the recovery of a great Beatles album from a botched production job.	The Beatles were a ridiculously ambitious band from the beginning of their career to the end.  The sessions for "Let it Be" started in early 1969, just weeks after the release of the White Album.  John, Paul and George were each expected to have new songs ready for this misbegotten film/concert project.  By comparison, bands today can take 3 years between albums and be considered productive.  So it's not surprising that the material would be a little weaker--except, now that we really hear it properly, it's not weak, it's good!  In fact, I think John and Paul's songs on this album beat most of their stuff on the more-respected "Abbey Road."  This is accomplished in part by the addition of John's b-side "Don't Let Me Down" to the song list. In addition, Lennon gives us the great "Across the Universe," the better-than-you-remember it "Dig a Pony," and his essential bridge section to McCartney's better-than-you-remember-it "I've Got a Feeling."  Paul's stuff is even better--really the last great Paul songs before his solo career.  I'll take "Get Back" or "Let it Be" over anything Paul contributed to "Abbey Road," even the "suite" of unfinished fragments that everyone thinks is so brilliant.	Shorn of the glutinous orchestrations and pseudo-documentary transitions (you won't miss "phase one, in which Doris gets her oats!"), almost everything here is better than you remember it, because the remastering makes even the agreed-upon classics, "Get Back," "Let it Be," "Two of Us" and "Across the Universe" sound more like what Paul originally intended, the band (plus Billy Preston on keyboards) playing in your living room.  Another highlight is George's "For You Blue," which on this album is a revelation.  Not that this is such a stellar song, but it is one of the Beatles' best-sounding performances.  It's loose, yet precise.  I can't stop playing it.	So your imagination reels... could it have been possible for the Beatles to go on this way?  It was sort of the direction the Stones took, going forward by picking up the driving rock sound of their past and updating it. This album rocks more convincingly than anything on the White Album or Abbey Road, or any other album they did after "Help!"  This was the true genius of the Beatles--how they played together, which is why I tend to prefer their earlier stuff.  When they got too careful, well, of course sometimes it worked great, but sometimes they were a little stiff.  Nothing on this album is the least bit stiff. It's pure pleasure, and most worthwhile.
0,Bella la musica latinoamericana.
0,I didn't have very high expectations for this album when it came out. I kinda figured the Chicks were due for a clunker- I mean, 3 best-selling/critically acclaimed albums in a row- and how could they top "Home" (my favorite of theirs)? Also, all the B.S. surrounding their politics seemed like it would take the wind out of their sails and distract them. I wasn't even going to buy it- I had seen the video for "Not Ready..." and thought it rather tepid, with a clichedchord progression, actually kinda boring. But one morning I heard the beginning of "Baby Hold On" on the Imus in the Morning Show and was totally blown away. It reminded me how much these women have to offer musically. I bought the album shortly after, and was very impressed. I wanted to wait a little while after the inital couple weeks of listening, to see if I found myself still needing to hear it. I'm still needing to hear it. Just so you know, I'm not a huge country fan. I like the Chicks, Alison Krause/Union Station, and Dwight Yoakham. A little Wille Nelson and Johnny Cash. Other than that, my favorite country songs are ones by The Allman Bros, Stones, Zeppelin, etc. From my perspective, this album is country. It's got mandolin, fiddle, pedal steel, banjo- it's country. Maybe their least country, but still fits the bill. My humble impressions...		"Taking the Long Way" is as strong a leadoff song as on any of their albums. The harmonies flow like a waterfall and it has great energy. "Not Ready.." has really grown on me, and is now one of my favorites- I just needed to hear it in the context of the album, independent of the video. "Everybody Knows" is one of the best ones ...this and "Bitter End" (one of Natalie's best vocal performances on the album) display a vulnerability that is at once unexpected and disarming. "Lullaby" is beautiful, but a little too long, given how slow it is. "Lubbock or Leave It" seems to be the barnburner like "Sin Wagon" or "White Trash Wedding". Not as good as either one. I usually skip it, though I think the lyrics really needed to be said.  "Silent House" is cool- a loping, rocky beat and very lead guitar-esque violin solo. Very sad, very sweet lyrics. "Voice Inside My Head" is another standout...wonderful interlude with more of those oh-so-sweet harmonies. I feel the best track is "Baby Hold On"- speaking of sweet harmonies- indeed it is one of best of their entire catalogue. Simply sonically beautiful, very powerful..just listening to the end where Natalie cries "Hold on to me, just hold on to me" give me the chills. A soulful song with a theme anybody could relate to. Nice solo by John Mayer as well. Any former fan who finds they can't listen to the Chicks anymore for political reasons should give this one a listen- if it doesn't soften your heart, well, it's your loss.		It's not their best album, but a worthy addition to an already impressive body of work. I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could, but it's a little too long to merit 5. I can see how hardcore country fans might turn their noses at it, but if you're open minded and/or a big Dixie Chicks fan, give this one a listen. And by the way- if you get all bent out of shape because an artist you like doesn't have the political views you assumed they had- that suggests a very fragile world view. Half the country feels the way these ladies do...get over it. Also- I love the picture of Natalie in the CD booklet. She looks super fine :)
0,Record of the year!  Los Lobos have emerged from a long period of coasting, their great musical triumphs seemingly behind them (HOW WILL THE WOLF SURVIVE? and KIKO, their two greatest records, from 1984 and 1992), with a record the equal of those masterpieces.		  THE TOWN AND THE CITY includes 11 amazing new songs from the songwriting team of David Hidalgo and Louie Perez (music and lyrics, respectively), and 2 from the irrepressible Cesar Rosas.  The band is intact after all these years, though Cougar Estrada is added on drums and percussion -- their 30th anniversary is in the rear-view mirror.  They have produced an album in the best sense of that old-fashioned idea, a set of songs that hangs together thematically, telling the story of Mexican immigrants to the U.S., and one which reveals new facets upon multiple listening.		  I have listened to THE TOWN AND THE CITY back to back with KIKO many times in the last few weeks, and they are similarly brilliant.  In a recent interview (with Don McLeese, in NO DEPRESSION), Perez talks about how the band broke out of its creative slump, performing the entirety of KIKO live in order to rekindle its  sense of adventure and experimentation.  He also speaks of the band's recent troubles, and the world's troubles, and how those had to be surmounted.		  This is one of those great albums without a weak track, but some highlights include the instantly memorable "The Road to Gila Bend," which touches me as it is on my old turf, having lived in Tucson for 7 years in the 1990s, the great blues number "Two Dogs and a Bone," the tragic "Little Things," (the "Just a Man" of this album), the incredible avant time signature of "The City," with electronically altered dogs barking, the funky "Free Up," and finally "The Town," a moving memory of home, and of bedrock values in a world full of insanity and evil.		 There is absolutely no overt politics here, but with quiet dignity and pride Los Lobos speak louder than shouting to the current climate of anti-Mexican racism and attacks along the border.  This is an AMERICAN band, one with a MEXICAN heritage.  Los Lobos are much more than a good-time party band, though they are that, as anyone who has seen them live can testify!  With THE TOWN AND THE CITY they have reclaimed their position as the best and most important band in the land.
0,This disc is fantastic!  If you like 60's pop music, I think you'll love this disc.  Still popping it in the changer 5 years after its release...reminds me most of 60's bubble gum pop.  Catchy tunes that will stick with you long after the last song finishes.  You'll be pressing your player's "full  repeat" button!
0,I remember listening Rush's 1st album way back when (pre-Peart), and became a huge fan of their brand of Progressive music. I remained a loyal Rush fan, purchaser of albums, and couch potato listening to many hours of almost every album over and over until the mid-80's. That's when they lost me with the musical changes...the 'radio-friendly' phase they gravitated into. While I never begrudged them for growing and evolving as they did, the change just happened to come at about the same time I bacame totally bored of ALL radio music. Up until that point however, I had never seen them live in concert.		Fast forward 20+ years, with Rush no longer on my radar...and I'm shopping online for a DVD to watch on my new HDTV. R30 looked like the perfect music video to watch so I bought it. I was extremely impressed with the quality of the video, the absolutely perfect all-emcompassing sound, and the professionalism of Rush onstage. This DVD was so impressive, I made it a point to catch them on their next tour, which my daughter and I did that summer (her 1st concert). Without the DVD, I never would have thought of seeing Rush live, let alone spending the time and money driving 4 hours to the concert.		I highly recommend this DVD to any Rush fan.
0,i found thier music sound so old.... older than thier age.	but the point is ... they know what they want and they do it good.	the strokes is a great band compare to some Brit-pop bands like...<...
0,Very Happy!
0,In my humble opinion, Dinah Washington was the greatest American female singer ever and this is the best place to sample her wares.  She could sing it all in a crystal clear voice, whether it was blues, jazz, pop,  standards, or rock & roll.	This two-CD retrospective does a marvelous  job in covering the highlights from her years with the Mercury label, and  unless you're wealthy enough or fanatic enough to buy the "Complete  Mercury Recordings" collection of Dinah, here is the essential  recording to have.
0,like to when i got it in the mail. this was better then I thought i was going to get there isn't even a scratch on the CDs
0,This album is a very good female vocalist adult alternative rock/folk album.  It isn't all upbeat & cheerful, there are a couple of slow/ballad songs on it -- so that only rates a 4/5 star rating from me.  But, overall, she is worthy of inheriting the female vocalist legacy from the likes of Anna Nalick, Donna Lewis, Ellie Lawson, Katie Melua, Natalie Imbruglia, Nelly Furtado, Rachael Yamagata, and many many others.  Her voice and music sound like a mix between Nelly, Ellie, & Natalie primarily.
0,Jackie is a breath of fresh air. A beautiful girl with a beautiful voice. This CD is worth the $! I play it all the time. I have found great value on Amazon.
0,Fenriz is a dark mastermind and gets to show his fullest potential in any ISENGARD album. While the first 7 songs are no doubt the best, the other songs must be appreciated by true DARKTHRONE fans. Fenriz' voice is almost shriek-for-shriek compared to Nocturnal Culto and guitars are,as always, thrashing.
0,Very funny movie. The songs are ok to great. The best ones are early on. There is no score, which I like from film soundtracks, but this is still a pretty good buy. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes these bands and has seen the film. I don't particularly like the bands but as a die hard film fan and soundtrack fan, I quite like the idea. It's not one of the best I've got from Amazon, but still worth the money. Good complement to one of the funniest movies.
0,Love it!!
0,I bought this album on a whim, but I am so glad I did. Its beautiful and lovely and once again, I am just so glad I bought it
0,This album isn't too bad. Sure they had way better moments such as Computer World and The Man-Machine but Electric Cafe doesn't have too many disappointments. It's worth the price just for "The Telephone Call" alone.
0,Stephen Hough's taste and technique certainly aren't subject to meaningful criticism from the likes of me: this is a well-chosen program that bespeaks his intelligence and musicianship.  The Polonaise-Fantasy in particular is full-bloodedly impressive, while the performances of the Berceuse and Barcarolle are endearing.  I am still coming to grips with his interpretation of the Sonata--several auditions have left me preferring the new recording by Alberto Reyes on VAI.  But, most unfairly as far as Mr. Hough is concerned, Mr. Reyes (as well as many others) has a distinct advantage: a decent recording.  I don't know what happened but this one from Hyperion sounds to me as though someone threw a blanket over the piano, it's that murky.  I had hoped that this would be a high point in the Chopin bicentennial but the recording quality is enough to preclude that.
0,And just when you thought the music was awful, this comes out, Limp Bizkit, Significant Other. And they've changed, listen to Three Dollar Bill then this, very different. Songs like Break Stuff, I'm Broke and Trust? are the anger songs, where songs like Re-Arranged, No Sex and Don't Go Off Wandering show the true mellowness of Limp, and songs like Just Like This, Nookie and Show Me What You Got are songs that can get you dancing to the beats, where Intro, n2Gether Now and Outro have their finest raps(yes even for an Intro and Outro). Limp Bizkit have truly made great albums, but this is argueably the best album, next to Chocolate Starfish. I know that Limp Bizkit are making a 5th album in September, I know they won't disappoint. Here's the review.	-----------------------------------------------------------------	1)Intro: DJ Lethal rock the house. 5/10	2)Just Like This: Nice, that alien-like talk in the middle isn't too bad, and the drums are great. No swearing either, which can be either good or bad, whether or not you like swear words. 8/10	3)Nookie: Heavy metal in the middle surrounded by entertaining funky beats. Fred does great vocals in this one, and that special skit at the end with some people breaking stuff is so funny. I've listened to this song for 3 months and still I'm not tired of it. Very good. 10/10	4)Break Stuff: Much like Stuck, only twice as good. This song may only be 2 and 3 quarter minutes, but it's really heavy. After hearing this song, I've always enjoyed it when someone gets shot or knocked out. THANKS LIMP BIZKIT! 10/10	5)Re-Arranged: After Break Stuff is a ballad that's nice and mellow. Best Bass line on CD, vocals that keep on coming, nice drums, talentful guitars, and a DJ Lethal solo st the end. My favourite song. 10/10	6)I'm Broke: Much like Break Stuff, only the story's different. This is about a certain money-lending but he ain't getting paid back, and now he wants it back before he knocks him out, and if that ain't enough, there's a special answering machine skit at the end. 10/10	7)Nobody Like You: Jon Davis of KoRn lends vocals on this song, and so does STP's Scott Weiland. And it's not just the vocals, think Wes Borland and Sam Rivers, they kill the song with the insane guitar and bass lines, especially after the 2nd chorus. 10/10	8)Don't Go Wandering: Another mellow song, can't quite explain what the story's about, but pretty good vocals by Fred Durst. As the 2nd chorus ends, and it goes quiet and then gets a little louder, they start screaming. Again, no swearing, which can either be good or bad. For me, it's good, coz I can sing the lyrics without getting busted. An excellent and underrated song. 9/10	9)9 Teen 90 Nine: Not bad actually, heavy drumwork by John Otto. A mosh song which is full of swearing. But I enjoy it at the end, sweet heavy work, and after the song, an interlude featuring Fred's mother. A song that's gonna get good reviews. 9/10	10)N 2 Gether Now: DJ Lethal gets to scratch again, only for the entire song. It's Method Man, SWEET! He and Fred show off their mic skills. Funky beats and crazy mic skills. A deadly combination, but can make a good song. 10/10	11)Trust?: The 3rd anger song. A combination of I'm Broke, 9 Teen 90 Nine and Break Stuff. Sam Rivers again shows off his bass skills. Also a good nu-metal song. And at the end there's a rap solo that goes for a minute and a half. Great anger song. 10/10	12)No Sex: I have nothing to do with this song(I'm only 13). But still a good song. Aaron Lewis of Staind lends a hand. This is a sweet-as song. 8/10	13)Show Me What You Got: The props song, bands, tours, people, places. He thanks Eminem, which surprises me, he wasn't even on the record. Unless you count that song they did together, called: "Turn Me Loose". INSANE guitars by Wes Borland, and another rap song at the end. 2nd best on here. 10/10	14)A Lesson Learned: Not bad, but could be better if there was better sound and actual guitar. And Fred sings in a voice that he had in Three Dollar Bill's Everything. But still it's not bad. 5/10	15)Outro: DJ Lethal rock the house again, and a Backstreet Boys diss, YAY!, then comes Matt Pinfield, he starts saying how good Limp Bizkit is, but then starts about how he hates those teeny-bopping artists, and he storms off, and Fred comes off after him trying to calm him down, a very funny outro, and then Les Claypool turns up, and starts saying that the listener just wasted their hard-earned $...(Of course he's kidding, but he does seem a bit high doesn't he?). 10/10	-----------------------------------------------------------------	A funny Outro to an EXCELLENT CD! Wait till the 5th album comes out in September. Allright, PEACE, MAN!
0,bowie in one of his phases
0,Lyrics like these, from "Blinded By The Darkness," give a taste of how relevant this record is:		The laws of God and the laws of man		The laws of man		They don't carry the same weight as the laws of God		Or the laws of nature		In the nomenclature		Do we want to inject the concept of sin		Into the Constitution?		Is this really necessary?		Does this not make you somewhat wary?		Shouldn't sin be left to the laws of God		And to the laws of nature?		Can we trust this to the legislature?		And shall we trust sin to the wisdom		Of the criminal justice system		Which can't handle the criminals we have now		Why create a whole new class of them?		Isn't crime dealt with by the laws of man?		Isn't sin dealt with by the laws of God?		If sin were dealt with by the laws of man		Everybody would be in jail for life		In solitary confinement		With no one to go his bail		Or would have gotten death		Maybe I should save my breath		But this lunacy is bound to fail		But there would be no one to get the food		Or run the machines		Mercy on us, dude		You shine your darkness on me		I am blinded by the darkness		In seven days God created evolution		When shall I expect retribution		From the counter revolution?
0,This was a nice collection from the dynamic seventies/eighties techno-rock group, with the fun "Tonight She Comes" added in, but one glaring omission was "Hello Again", the rockingest single they ever released.  Yeah, go ahead and hit the "no" button if you want, but you rate a "GH" release as a whole, not song by song, and as a whole, this deserved a "4" for leaving out such a good single.
0,The Moody Blues have released several concert DVD's. This is the fourth one I have seen, and while it does not feature the orchestra's seen in "Night at Red Rocks" or "Live at Albert Hall", it is an amazing concert all the same.  The flautist and pianist who replace the two retired Moody Blues members (Whose names escape me) are also in fine form. Just watch "Are you sitting comfortably" in surround sound and watch this amazing flautist at work, she is simply brilliant.		Unlike the "Live at Albert Hall" DVD, the tracklisting here is much longer, and there is a resonably good coverage of songs from the early days to later days (although more from the early days would have been good).  Justin's voice is beautiful, and he does a nice version of "Forever Autumn".  Other highlights of this concert include "The voice" and "Tuesday afternoon".		You'd be surprised how many people out there only know the Moodies for "Nights in white satin". But they are so much more than that.  Check out this DVD and discover the magic of my all-time favourite band.  God bless them.
0,I am not a huge Crimson fan.  I heard this album first when I was 18, an impressionable age to be sure.  I know Court of the Crimson King, Red, Thrak, etc., but this is my personal favorite line up and, perhaps, Crimson's best album.  Adrian Belew, fresh from tours with Zappa and the Talking Heads, infuses the band with polyrythmic intensity and Afro-Brazilian beats.  His voice is rather limited and an acquired taste.  Tony Levin (Peter Gabriel, California Guitar Trio) holds down a nasty, Chapman Stick-infused bottom (and adds some great aural textures),while Bill Bruford (Yes, XTC, Earthworks) provides amazing, frenetic fills.  This group has the chops to compete with guitarist Robert Fripp and the result is some incredible, moody  music.  The opener, Elephant Talk, is a funny, funky dance beat of a song (and I don't associate Crimson with funny, but I think Belew brings some much needed levity to this album, in counterpoint to lead guitarist Robert Fripp's pretentiousness).  Frame By Frame follows with dueling guitars and soaring vocals - a real mind bender. Matte Kudasai is a pretty ballad with wailing seagull guitars; and if you purchase the newest edition, you get a second version of the song with a Fripp solo.  Indiscipline is a mad, head-splitting romp (though it doesn't make your ears bleed like the double trio Crimson).  Thela Hun Ginjeet (still covered by Primus/Les Claypool) is a rollicking, bouncy joy.  The final two tracks, Sheltering Sky and Discipline, are very strong.  Sheltering Sky is a personal favorite, with Bruford using a slit drum to great effect; the percussion, the weird Chapman Stick rumblings and the Frippertronics all blend seamlessly into a wonderfully hypnotic whole.  You will either love or leave this disc, and it likely depends on your age and your exposure to Crimson.  For me, Discipline is one of the top 100 pop releases of all time.  I think it still sounds remarkably fresh.
0,Excellent
0,What can I say about this blessed woman, who has shared her gift with the world over and over again.  Before my time, during my parents young lives, and now my adult life.  Patti is Timeless and a great vocalist that captures the christmas spirit on this one.  She also have some romantic tunes included for you love birds during the season of true love, Christ birthday. I can't stop playing this cd, I love it so much.
0,Black Sabbath's 7th album release is a must have for your collection.  Released in 1976 while the band was still young, but only four years prior to Ozzy leaving the band.
0,So unique, wonderful, awesome.  My Brother who plays the Banjo and Madolin, guitar and harmonica, who has almost every cd pver made, did not have this one and had never heard of the wailin Jennys.  I was great to play this for him.
0,If you like the first ASIA album and think it was somewhat in a class by itself compared with ALL the ASIA releases, then this is practically a "must have".		First off, this rocks.  The band seriously puts in an energetic, almost punk-ish performance (as punk-ish as a bunch of prog rockers could get).  The enthusiasm and energy is palpable.  My only exposure to "live Asia" has been the MTV performance with Greg Lake, the "Live in Moscow" DVD (which was fairly unimpressive and "by the numbers" for me), and the newest "Live in Tokyo" (although a somewhat geriatric performance from 2007, a very decent performance none-the-less).		So, to hear the original Wetton, Howe, Downes, and Palmer line-up from back in 1982, when they were all still capable of pulling off a quite-rocking performance, I was way pleased.  Howe executes his licks with almost carefree elation, Wetton's seemingly-almost-shot voice stays strong the entire concert, and the keys and drums nail their end, keeping everything up-tempo and rocking.  Compared to the "Live in Tokyo" performance where they're 25+ years older (and understandably slower), this performance is phenomenal.  It's just a very nice snap-shot of a band at the top of their game, enjoying the success and vibe of their well-written and well-performed songs.		BUT, for someone looking for an A+ performance, you won't find it on these 2 CD's.  You can hear the parts clearly enough (vox--including Steve Howe's backing vocal "attempts"--bass, guitar, keys, drums, etc), but Wetton's voice isn't perfect (he dorks up the lyrics in the first song), the mix is decent but not perfect, and as a whole, this definitely isn't a professionally-produced, quality album.  Despite those negatives, it's a very nice trip back in time with a band that had the number one selling album for 1982, and seemed to be thoroughly enjoying riding high on the "heat-of-the-moment" (pardon the pun).		A couple more negative points though: from the song list, there are a couple badly edited tunes, where the intro is abrupt or the outro is chopped off.  Not enough to detract from the whole 2-CD set, but enough you'll likely notice.		So, don't expect awesome sound quality (especially if you're spoiled by so many "supposed live" performances that have been "fixed" and overdubbed in post-production), but DO expect very acceptable sound quality and an incredibly energetic performance from a group of proggers in their prime, whose chemistry was too easily torn apart and tainted by ego, aspirations of pop/rock stardom, and the invasion of 80's pop and hair-metal rock.		I personally rate this a 5+ for the performance (I'm forgiving of the glitches, seeing the rawness as a positive thing), and a 3 for the overall quality of the recording and CD production.		I can't believe this thing was available back in 2003 and I just discovered it a few weeks ago.
0,This was my first introduction to Eligh, having heard(or rather listed) his name dropped on the internet. I decided to check him out, and going to the local record store, found Enigma(that being the only Eligh release they had). When I popped it in I was stunned, half the tracks were tight instrumentals and there was a live guitarist jammin away on some tracks. And furthermore, Eligh's flow and lyrics are dope! It turns out that Eligh produced all the beats on the album, and they are equally tight and atmospheric. This was a great buy, especially since these days I am a little weary about purchasing CD's from artists I have never heard of(sometimes only half of the album is good and the rest is filler). But with Eligh, everything about this album is mysterious and top notch. Eligh's lyrics are both intellectual, infectous and positive. I highly recommend this album to hip hop lovers and musician lovers worldwide.

0,What a followup to "Changes in the Weather", wonderful music from start to finish.  So many favorite songs, each one is so good it is hard to pick a favorite.  Buy this music now if you do not have it, it is worth the purchase.  Will not leave your cd rotation for awhile, it is that good.
0,This is another great CD from this group.  Not my favourite but certainly in the top 3 they have ever produced.
0,You can disregard the negative comments about the PQ because the new BluRay has cleared that up.  It looks really great here.  I watched the original DVD over 100 times and i can agree that the PQ suffered there, but it didn't matter to me because the performance was so spectacular.		This new BD is an amazing step up in clarity, keep in mind that it was filmed on 16mm film so its still not razor sharp but its very very good.  THe audio and performance is what this is all about. Gabriel in concert is second to none.		Plus we get the performance of Red Rain here which i only had on my CD of the concert before, i onkly wish it were integrated into the concert instead of an extra.		Get it, its the greatest.
0,Joe Nichols returns with a hit album that has spawned a few hits for him, solidifying his position as a successful country artist in the music world. His breakthrough hit "The Impossible", which was dedicated to his father, hit close to home for many people and became a #1 hit. The second single, the honky tonk "Brokenheartsville" was a great choice, because it also hit #1, a fun breaking up song. His new single is "She Only Smokes When She Drinks". To me though, the best track is the closing title track, just an overall good song. This is country-country, none of that pop-country will be found here. Some songs are kind of laughable in terms of title and/or lyrical content like "Everything's A Thing", "Cool To Be A Fool" and "Life Don't Have To Mean Nothin' At All". Other highlights on the album include "Can't Hold A Halo To You", "You Ain't Heard Nothin' Yet" and "That Would Be Her". Check out this album from this very talented, and handsome man.
0,wonderful, old Emmy Lou. Her uplifting, cheerful voice and great guitar...don't need more than that!
0,I think I listen to this cd at least once a week. I love it! And, with all the great Mike songs on this I'm in heaven!		I'd give it 10 stars if the ratings allowed.
0,Sometimes one cannot win.  A few years ago, after some serious prodding bordering on violations of the Genera Conventions against torture, I was asked by the chairperson of my North Adamsville High School Class 1964 (ouch!) Reunion Committee to answer certain questions about my likes and dislikes back in the day. The purpose of this exercise (other than to see if we were still youthfully sharp) was to compile a survey /sketch of class life in the long ago misty 1960s. There was a certain method to her madness as she probed by stages starting off with easy stuff like favorite sports, teachers, school lunch (none of the above) and worked her way into more intimate stuff like personal tastes in music. Obviously as she reeled us in, such a profound question required answers, especially those of us wedded to rock and roll like some precious child.		But there was even more devilishness behind her CIA-like probes. She posed the questions very specifically and asked what she probably thought was an innocuous question: in your youth did you prefer The Rolling Stones or the Beatles? Innocent, right? Pick one or the other. I did and went on and on about how the Stones  lit my flamed-out youth on fire, how I came to the blues via their cover of Howlin' Wolf's (really Willie Dixon's) Little Red Rooster (banned in Boston, moreover, that made it just that much more appealing) etc. ,etc.		Are you with me so far? Then she asked about this combination- the Brenda Lee versus Patsy Cline shoot-out. What, are you kidding?  I cavalierly dismissed the notion of either singer have the slightest influence on my budding manly rock persona and refused, purposefully refused to answer (okay, okay I put N/A). No big deal this is America after all and N/A is part of the democratic tradition if frowned upon by partisans. End of story.		Not though when my "significant other" (known in the old days, in polite society, as my paramour and in impolite society as...oh, well you can fill in the blank) finished reading my response (I had off-handedly shown it to her for some laughs). The gist of her indignant argument centered on my alleged testosterone-driven choices of male Rock 'n' Roll bands like the Stones to the exclusion of kinder, gentler music-in short, choices that women might prefer. Okay, I took the point and then made my selection. Naturally, I need to make a little comment to motivate my choice.		Frankly, like I said, I really do not remember being a fan of either Brenda Lee or Patsy Cline in my youth. Both names are associated in those high school memories with dreamy school dances or other types of romantic endeavor. It was not until several years ago that I came to appreciate Patsy Cline's work. I have always been a sucker for female torch- singers like Billie Holiday and the young Peggy Lee in her Benny Goodman period but Patsy only recently became part of my musical interests as a country "torch" singer. So there you have my choice. Then. Since that time though, and the review of this Brenda Lee CD will bear this out, Ms. Lee (Brenda that is) has been making some strides. Of course this two CD set has most of the great stuff but why, why for a while now does the tune "I Want To Be Wanted " reverberate in my head. And truth. It did back in some mystic Saturday night high school dance time when I was looking toward having the last dance with a certain she. A case for Freud, no question.		One last word. My last word. Let me get back to that controversy with my "significant other" (I prefer "soul-mate" but I will let that pass here). I mentioned in that hard-nosed class reunion questionnaire that in the summer of 2005 I attended a Rolling Stones concert at Fenway Park. Now who do you think was standing beside me shaking, as the kids say, her "booty" for all she was worth? So much that testosterone theory. Moreover, who imprisoned me in Fenway Park practically at gunpoint, until I bought her a sassy little Stones T-shirt as a memento of the occasion? Enough said.		***********		Here Are Some Lyrics For Brenda and Patsy So You Can Make An Informed Decision On These Burning Questions Of The Day.		Brenda Lee - I'm Sorry lyrics		Lyrics to I'm Sorry :		I'm sorry, so sorry	That I was such a fool	I didn't know	Love could be so cruel	Oh, oh, oh, oh	Uh, oh	Oh, yes		You tell me mistakes	Are part of being young	But that don't right	The wrong that's been done		Spoken:	(I'm sorry) I'm sorry	(So sorry) So sorry	Please accept my apology	But love is blind	And I was to blind to see	Oh, oh, oh, oh	Uh, oh	Oh, yes		You tell me mistakes	Are part of being young	But that don't right	The wrong that's been done	Oh, oh, oh, oh	Uh, oh	Oh, yes		I'm sorry, so sorry	Please accept my apology	But love was blind	And I was too blind to see	(Sorry)		<strong>She's Got You Lyrics		Artist: Patsy Cline </strong>		I've got your picture that you gave to me	And it's signed with love just like it used to be	The only thing different, the only thing new	I've got your picture, she's got you		I've got the records that we used to share	And they still sound the same as when you were here	The only thing different, the only thing new	I've got the records, she's got you		I've got your memory, or, has it got me?

0,Regina Belle who possesses one of the purest & most exquisite voices on the R&ampB scene is back with a new CD,	Reachin' Back (Columbia). This is Regina's tribute to one of her strongest roots, the Philadelphia Sound. This music is not	over produced & overcooked. The arrangements & production are simple and do justice to this girls splendid voice, you can	feel every note that she sings! For the real thing, checkout her covers of "Love T.K.O", "Didn't I (Blow Your Mind This Time),	& "I'll Be Around". This girls gonna be around for a long time!
0,I set to dispise this album cuz JT is too mainstream and trendy. I still think it's most fluff, but after one listen, I'm completley hooked. Makes you want to dance and sing along.
0,MUSIC WITHOUT LABEL.that's the vibe here.so many Different Styles&Yet to this day this Album Sounds Fresher than Almost Any thing You Here Nowadays. CHERCHEZ LA FEMME/Se SI BON is A Classic Song that COmbines Music  Styles&Era's&still works very well. I MISS The Days When Music used  To Challenge You&Real Instrumentation. This Album is Alot of Fun.
0,THE BAND: Scott Weiland (vocals), Slash (guitars), Dave Kushner (guitars), Duff McKagen (bass), Matt Sorum (drums & percussion).		THE DISC: (2007) 13 tracks clocking in at approximately 51 minutes. Included with the disc is a 6-page foldout containing song titles/credits, song lyrics, band photos, and thank you's. Recorded at Henson Recording Studios (Hollywood, CA). All songs written by Velvet Revolver except "Can't Get You Out Of My Head" by Jeff Lynne (ELO). The disc is enhanced and contains a 10 minute "Re-Evolution" making of Libertad - containing interviews and studio footage. At the end of the disc there is an untitled bonus track (within track 13). Label - RCA Records.		COMMENTS: I went into "Libertad" with no expectations. Knowing the band member history and especially the music capabilities of Slash (Guns 'N Roses) and Weiland (Stone Temple Pilots)... I, like so many listeners purchased on that fact alone. I'd be lying if I didn't say that I was slightly disappointed with the band's first, "Contraband" (2004). I had high expectations with their debut and was craving brilliant fireworks, and it just didn't come through (though "Slither" and "Fall To Pieces" were Top 100 hits - both great songs - but in the end, it was proven that 3 or 4 strong songs do not make an album). "Libertad" (meaning - 'the state of not being in control and being able to do whatever one wishes') comes though in a big way for me. Slash is playing guitar like he has something to prove. Weiland's voice sounds strong - and many a day I've wished his drug and/or alcohol dependencies were behind him... in the end, time will certainly tell. Typically, on first listen, I give a song about 60 seconds. If it's good, I let the whole song play. Same for the rest of the album. On "Libertad", I didn't hit the forward button once. The songs were catchy, the hooks memorable, song structure was varied - just a great rock album. I think the band turned it up a notch and released a slicker and more cohesive album. The rhythm guitar on so many songs are rich with texture, attitude and sleazy hooks.. .reminding me of Joe Perry (Aerosmith "Rocks" in particular)... "She Builds Quick Machines" is my favorite example (not to mention Slash simply shreds throughout the song). The album features 3 tracks destined for radio and ringtones - the rocker "She Builds Quick Machines", the slower main stream ""The Last Fight", and the funky "She Mine". All are worthy. Outside of "The Last Fight" and the band's average at best attempt at covering "Cant Get You Out Of My Head", the album is upbeat, fast and heavy. We all know Weiland can put his own spin on a classic (their version of Aerosmith's "No More, No More" and the his version of Led Zeppelin's "Dancing Days" with the STP's come to mind), but this ELO remake is my least favorite track on the disc. In typical STP fashion and humor, the last track "Gravedancer" fades out after the 4 minute mark, a brief pause, and then a bonus track in a country/western flavor that would make Loretta Lynn proud... or blush ("Don't Drop That Dime"). I'm not sure what the meaning of the title of this album is... "Libertad"... could it be a past/present/future feeling from a record label? Or some other hidden meaning that's special to the band? Either way, the disc rocks and I think it easily surpasses their debut (5 stars).
0,ok
0,WE HAVE ALWAYS PLAYED ALL OF THE SINATRA SONGS AND THIS WAS A REPLACEMENT FOR THE ONE LIKE THIS ONE CRACKED.
0,Velvet Revolver is one of the bands I listen to the most these days, along with Guns N' Roses. If you don't know, Velvet Revolver started out with ex-Guns N' Roses members Slash, Duff, and Matt. I still think GN'R is better than Velvet Revolver, because Guns is more original rock and I think Axl is a better singer, but don't get me wrong; This is a great cd.		Sucker Train Blues- 4/5 I like this song, but I think they could have made a better song to begin an album with.		Do it for the Kids- 5/5 Great song. I especially love the beginning.		Big Machine- 5/5 Another great, fast moving song.		Illigal I song- 4/5 Good song, but the singing kinda drags on a little		Spectale- 5/5 Great guitar in this song, like the lyrics too.		Fall to Pieces- 5/5 A slower moving song, but great guitar and excellent lyrics. This song was about how a member of the band was recovering from drugs.		Headspace- 5/5 Great heavy metal song!		Superhuman- 4/5 Pretty good, but the singing kinda drags on.		Set me Free- 4/5, about the same as last song.		You Got No Right- 4/5 Slower song, but still a good one to listen to.		Slither- 5/5 Great Song, love the lyrics and singing		Dirty Little Thing- 5/5 A very fun song to listen to		Loving the Alien- 4/5 Nice slow song to end the album.		All in all, if you like hard rock, I would recommend this cd. I would also recommend Guns N' Roses's "Appetite for Destruction." I think Slash, Duff, and Matt still should have stayed with Axl. I think they played better in Guns N' Roses, but their still awesome in Velvet Revolver. Hope this review was helpful to you.
0,The performance of 'Black Queen' by Stephen Stills, Buddy Miles, Jack Bruce, Roland Kirk, and Dallas Taylor is one of the most musically brilliant achievements I have seen in 40 years of listening to and watching music.  By itself, this performance warrants the purchase of the DVD.  This is a simply devastating rendition of 'Black Queen.'		A few other songs by Stills and Buddy Miles are also worth seeing.  The rest is worth watching maybe one time but I still give this one 4 stars because of these few performances.
0,Bjork is just awesome. And, this cd proves it again. "Earth Intruders" is my favorite, but it is full of great songs, you won't be disappointed.
0,Boy am I glad I didn't go by the reviews I read about this album. I did actually put off buying this for a few months but then curiosity got the better of me and i purchased it.	Sure this is a collection of demos alternate takes and jams but anybody else would kill to be able to put out an album of this quality. it rocks.	For a long time I thought Hendrix was an over hyped icon. Sure ,i liked the "hits" like "Purple Haze" "watchtower" <"Foxey Lady" etc... but a few years ago a friend gave me a copy of Elecrtic Ladyland and I' ve been a Hendrix freak ever since. I buy anything i can find.	And South Saturn delta being my latest acquisition, I loved it. "Message To The Universe" blew me away. the solo is just amazing. As I drove down the road i nearly jumped out of my seat, it was so intense i was grinning from ear to ear.	Tax Free" "Pali Gap" and "Laughing Sam's Dice"? Wow! all great tunes.	While I wouldn't recommend this as your first Hendrix Album. I do recommend it to hardcore fans and those familiar with Jimi's work.	This is a great collection of tunes.
0,Fine performances and Bette is clear as a bell.  Get the early Barbra Streisand stuff too.
0,This is the single greatest collection of Jazz music ever put together.  If you're a long-time jazz fan, this has everything you could want. If  you're a casual jazz fan, this has everything you could ever need. Buy  this. Right now.
0,I bought this for my Dad.  He has thanked me many times for it. And for him to stop working or talking to listen to this CD it's a must have
0,This odd, bloated, slightly unfinished-sounding opus is massively overrated ("Village Green" it ain't), but it does contain some great Ray Davies tunes.  "Yes Sir, No Sir", "Some Mother's  Son", and "Shangri-La" are all excellent and nearly up to  the standard that this fine band had set with previous efforts.  But most  of the rest of this album hints at the rot that had set in and just started  to fester as the 60s came to a close.  Proceed with caution....
0,I first purchased this album over a year ago expecting a carbon copy of the Orb - I was both disappointed and enthralled that this wasn't the case. This is one of those CD's that begins brilliantly and ends brilliantly. The middle sort of evaporates into early 90s exploratory techno. However the major major stand out tracks are no. 3 - 9"25, one of the best ambient dub compositions I have ever heard. Definitely up there with The Orb's - Star '6,7,8,9' and The Starseeds 'Behind The Sun' and Spacetime Continuum 'Pressure'. The final two tracks are beuatiful atmospheric compositions, the latter very sad and reflective with the wonderful use of male synthesised voices against a pure ambient wash - stunningly beautiful. As is Track 2 known commonly as 'The Tick-Tock' tune as its had exposure elsewhere such as Nick Warren's mix CD 'Rekjavic'. This duo have created one of the landmark ambient albums of the past century and stands up well with the like of The Orb, Future Sound of London, The Starseeds, Brian Eno and Ulrich Schnauss.		 However I think in some respects it is disappointing because of the now dated early 90 techno sounds and some of the middle tunes of the album are fairly boring and reptitive and the five tracks I mentioned earlier are so much better.		 So plus points then, perfectly realised soundscapes and ambition. Beautiful use of instruments and melody lines on several tracks as well as organically constructing the 'songs'.		 Minus points - some repetitive, early 90s techno/house stuff which is now extremely dated, the lack of cohesion in the middle of the album.		 Hope this gives you some idea of what you are buying into.		 Tom
0,Just got it today-2/10/2016!! I love it!! Awesome!! Fantastic!! Amazon is like a Xmas Wonderland!! I will be doing all of my shopping here!! Great music store!! Great!! Amazon has everything you could ever imagine or want!! :o)
0,When I first bought this, it was for NO HOLDING BACK, and I would play THAT ONE TRACK TO DEATH!!!  Didn't care about the rest of the songs.  Years later, I pull it out of my bin, and to my surprise, I REALLY missed out!!!  This was the perfect blend of Reggae and R&B!!!  Every song had a beat, which required a bounce.  Fast dance bounce, mid-tempo dance bounce, slow drag bounce.  This recording with Wayne's vocals made the perfect mix of gettin' it in while you can!  The only thing that I'm sorry about it the length of time I lost.  NO HOLDING BACK will ALWAYS be my favorite, however, this cd had a lot going for it, and even today, it still does.  YOU BETTA MAKE A BODY BOUNCE, WAYNE!!!
0,Although I like a lot of alt music- Grizzly Bear, Animal Collective, Fever Ray etc., Dirty Projectors took a lot more work.  Someone sent me their previously best known song like 2 years ago, (Rise Above) and I couldn't stand it.		When "Stillness is the Move" became "the" single from Bitte Orca, I was like, here we go again.  But as 2009 wore on, as the good reviews piled up, and as I saw them play Cannibal Resource on late night TV, I started listening to them in a little different light.		By the end of the year, it was the album I went back to more and more and could stand up to serious airplane listening.  Sure it's complex.  No it's not for everyone.  But it's accomplished and totally awesome if you listen.  Or better yet, see them live.  Watching the Roots freak out over them on Fallon a few months ago was nice.  You see, the complexity of their sound tends to blow people away in person when they realize those are real people making all that music.		David Longstreth is not your average composer, arranger or vocalist.  Nor is he your average guitarist- the album has the best power riffs on any alt album I've heard in years. (Power chords probably not the right word)		Great, great album.  And recently, "Rise Above" came on unexpectedly at a party.  What an AMAZING song...
0,Wow. I had no idea who this was I just bought it on a whim.	His voice is so masculine, clear, controlled and I hope it's not wrong to say sexy! haha Yum!
0,This is Cher's classical and essential work. If You're a fan of Cher's newer retails like ''Living Proof'' and ''Believe'' then you might want to think twice about purchasing this record. Since it features most of Cher's early classics, while we get one new track ''Don't Come Cryin' To Me'', which sounds allot like ''Save Up All Your Tears''.	The track listing and time is:	1. Don't Come Cryin' To Me. (4:02)	2. Love And Understanding. (4:42)	3. Save Up All Your Tears. (4:03)	4. The Shoop Shoop Song (It's In His Kiss). (2:50)	5. After All (Love Theme From Chances Are). (4:03)	6. If I Could Turn Back Time. (4:13)	7. Just Like Jesse James (4:06)	8. Heart Of Stone (Remix). (4:16)	9. I Found Someone. (3:41)	10. We All Sleep Alone. (3:53)	11. Bang Bang (New Version). (3:51)	12. Take Me Home. (3:27)	13. Dark Lady. (3:27)	14. Half-Breed. (2:44)	15. The Way Of Love. (2:31)	16. Gypsys, Tramps and Thieves. (2:36)	17. I Got You Babe (Sonny & Cher). (3:09)	Five Songs are written By Diane Warren, Two by Sonny Bono, one written by Bon Jovi, also one by Michael Bolton and the rest are various other writers. My Favorites are; After All, Don't Come Cryin' To Me, Save Up All Your Tears, If I Could Turn Back Time, I Found Someone. I like all of the songs, but those are my favorites.	I also like the cover for this album, it expands into a poster, at the back it has some really nice pictures of Cher throughout the years, including all her history and not forgetting to mention her acting pursuits. A Nice Collection of songs. For Any long-time Cher Fans, wanting to recall her most successful and classical moments.	Enjoy!.
0,Barry has 5 released live albums so far:	-Live (1977)	-Live in Britain (1982)	-Live on Broadway (1990)	-From Manilow to Mexico (1995)	-Two Nights Live (2004)	Though Two Nights Live is by far the best of all, I still wouldn't give it five stars. Here's why:	(1) They've decided not to include hits such as Could it be Magic, which many fans and most casual listeners would like to see in a collection like this	(2) They've also left out two or three songs from Here at the Mayflower which, according to whoever saw the show, were phenomenal live.	(3) There's relatively little dialog between the songs, which, imho, is what sets Manilow shows apart from the rest.	(4) He could've restrained his voice a bit more in some of the songs. The Best of Me is the first one to come to mind.	Having said that, though:	(1) Overall, Barry's in very good voice. His renditions of Trying to Get the Feeling, Somewhere Down the Road and Mandy are probably the finest he's ever done.	(2) The Mayflower songs sound WAY better live than in the studio album. "I'm Coming Back", for example, sounds like a whole different song. And so does "Turn the Radio up".	(3) They've included rarities from the 70s and 80s such as "Who's Been Sleeping in my Bed" and "Sweet Heaven".	(4) Songs such as "Forever and a Day", "We live on Borrowed Time" and "You're There", which fans have been longing to hear on CD for at least 6 years, are finally there. But I still think they sound better on the original videos (Close up/A & E special.)
0,If you are on board with Devin Townson, this is a good one to get. Its medium intensity- not very heavy but for the most part not easy listening. Has some really good vocal that really makes the songs come together on this one. The first track is the star. Note: this recording is dated and very complex to mix with God knows how many studio tracks. He probably did not have the budget to have it mixed as good as it possibly could be. That said, CD and high fidelity stereo is the way to go on this one. If you are thinking about using your tiny PC speakers and an MP3, it's a little hard to equalize and hear it as he intended it to sound.
0,Trumpeter Benny Bailey is part of the group and solos on all tracks where Dolphy plays alto saxophone 1,3,6,7	Eric plays bass clarinet on 2 and 4 and flute on track 5
0,I thought that the song, "This is My World," which I remembered for the film, Shallow Hal, was the kind of song that should have been nominated for an Academy Award whether it was for the film or not. Anyway, I picked this compact disc and really enjoy listening to it for the most part. I honestly didn't know that Darius Rucker was a country singer or part of Hootie and Blowfish. He has a soothing voice and sings great songs.
0,good job
0,The first album by the only Christian band that I listen to. One thing that i love about this band that even though i usually dislike Christian music, i am not embarrassed to listen to. The way that David Bazan tells stories makes the listener feel like they are there with the character. But one must take into account that this music is very downbeat and slow at times, but is also surprisingly beautiful. This music is mostly simplistic with an emphasis on the acoustic guitar, but incredibly powerful. So buy this album, or really anything by this band, because you won't be dissapointed.
0,To me, Milstein was the greatest violinist of the twentieth century. He was a great technical player and was an eqauly good muscian. I love his playing! He plays most of the great violin concertos and plays them beuatifully. His recordings of the Brahms, the Tchaikovsky, the Beethoven, Saint-Saens 3, an Introduction and Tarantelle are my favorites. This CD is pricey, but at least put it on your Christmas list. I don't actually own I've just listened to it and it's great so buy it if you can afford it.
0,great service & as described. thanks
0,Love his music. I would give Paul Cardall a fifteen star or higher if I could! His music is phenomenal. His music is genius, soul soothing and out of this world. I highly recommend his albums/CDs.
0,"This is the life" is Scottish singer/songwriter Amy McDonald's debut CD. Musically, she sounds a bit like Travis, while vocally, fellow Scot KT Tunstall or Dolores O'riordan come to mind. It was released in July 2007 when she was just 19, and features catchy guitar driven music with intelligent lyrics.		Opening the CD is the bouncy folk/pop of "Mr rock and roll", followed by the sunny toe-tapping title track "This is the life" (great guitar licks). The beautiful Libertines-like "Poison prince" was actually inspired by ex-Libertine Pete Doherty's drug addiction, though you'd hardly know that as you bounce around to it. Bringing the tempo down is the gentle acoustic ballad "Youth of today", followed by the melancholic "Run" (nice pulsing guitars), and the horn sprinkled brooding "Let's start a band". The melodramatic "Footballer's wife" takes a look at some celebrities' obsession with appearing in tabloids.		Elsewhere, we get the acoustic folk of "The road home" (simple and beautiful), the similar closing brief hidden track "Caledonia" (a nice bagpipe solo closes it), the upbeat and catchy "A wish for something more", the very bouncy "Barrowland ballroom" (with edgy guitars and sprinklings of horns, sounding very much like a pub sing-a-long song), and the down tempo country-ish "LA", a song about having and believing in ones dreams.		"This is the life" debuted at #2 in the UK when it came out in July, but finally topped the charts mid January 2008, earning a platinum certification. That she managed to achieve this without the help of smash hit singles (at #12, "Mr rock and roll" is the lone top 20 hit) is a testament to the quality of the music.
0,Priest Just keep releasing great albums.  British steel is another gem, though i find it hard to give this one 5 stars with the likes of breaking the law, living after midnight, and the poor mans Queen like anthem "united". not like those songs are horrible,  but they're not vintage either.  The vintage priest songs here are rapid fire, metal gods, grinder and "the rage". Once again, priest delivers the goods!
0,GREAT PRODUCT GREAT GLASS GREAT BEER GREAT GREAT GREAT A+ ALMOST AT THE WORD MINIMUM SO i CAN SUBMIT THIS REVIEW, GOT IT.
0,great album. Meadowlark is my favorite.
0,Where has this guy been? This is my second CD of his that I have in my collection now and its delicious. His soprano sax has to be the smoothest on the jazz airwaves. The cut " Secrets Told " is absolutely  gorgeous. Its almost in the same vain as his previous work Love's melody  and the cut " Easy Going ". In my opinion what makes this album  besides Kim's fabulous sax playing is his back-up band and the studio  mixing. Also included in this delious CD is Will Lee, Chuck Loeb and Andy  Snitzer on a couple of cuts. Man what more could you ask for other then a  glass of wine and your lady @ your side.
0,A Very Special Christmas Volume 7 has twelve holiday songs performed by some of the best young artists of our time; and if you like holiday music with a few contemporary twists this is certainly an album for you! These artists make their numbers shine bright with outstanding performances; and it all holds its own very well. The quality of the sound on this CD is excellent; and what is also wonderful about this CD is that its sales help to raise money for Special Olympics.		Colbie Caillat starts the album off with a superb rendition of "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas." The arrangement plays a little with the keys and the tempo to let Colbie put her own stamp on this ballad; I really like how well she does this. The Carter Twins do a fine job on "Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!;" they never sounded better and the guitar work really makes this number special. Great! Miley Cyrus does justice to "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree" as well; her version of the song rocks and Miley delivers it with lots of positive energy.		"Winter Wonderland" by Vanessa Hudgens absolutely charms me with its beauty; Vanessa's excellent diction enhances her performance and I love that percussion. What a voice Vanessa has! "The Little Drummer Boy" gets a passionate treatment from Sean Kingston; and Charice's "The Christmas Song" has Charice squarely in the spotlight--which is right where she belongs! Charice's voice is just perfect for this classic holiday song.		Kristinia DeBarge's "Do You Hear What I Hear?" impresses me greatly; Kristinia uses a most creative arrangement of this tune and it sounds really good. I also enjoy hearing Mitchel Musso do "Jingle Bell Rock;" Mitchel makes this rock and the guitars, percussion and drums carry the bulk of the music as Mitchel sings this faultlessly! "Christmas (Baby, Please Come Home)" gets the royal treatment from Leighton Meester; and the music fits in very well with Leighton's singing. "Christmas (Baby, Please Come Home)" rocks but it's still very poignant; it's a standout on this album.		"Santa Baby" by Kellie Pickler sounds wonderful--and how's about that music? "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing" is another charmer; Carrie Underwood delivers this with panache and just one listen proves it! "Last Christmas" by Ashley Tisdale features her great singing voice as she sings this very well; and the album ends with Gloriana performing "Silent Night." What a terrific way to end this album!		A Very Special Christmas Volume 7 is another awesome installment in this CD series; if you have the first 6 volumes you owe it to yourself to get this CD. In addition, fans of the performers on this album would do well to add this to their music collections.
0,Another great sound track by Thomas Newman. Totally enjoy this CD and have listened to it many, many times.
0,it's a fine soundtrack, containing all the mix of emotions of the film and well worth a listen.  One thing I have noticed about John Barry's soundtracks - at least the ones I like! - is that he uses the lower strings in an almost contrapuntal way, drawing you into the music;  in this case he combined them with other instruments to create the musical equivalent of entering a black hole.  I like it
0,This is a good cd but I must say the reason for me getting the cd is because of the song "Clean Hands", my favorite song on the cd...Check it out
0,I've been a Bob Baldwin fan for a long time & I've enjoyed his music over the years. Excellent musician. This CD is really great !!
0,What the hey...great title!  Great album.  From mariachi horns (Conquest) to bagpipes (Prickly Thorn to Sweetly Worn and St Andrew This Battle Is In the Air)!  From the grunge of Rag and Bone to the southern blues of Effect and Cause!  There is no genre for this!  I hear Led Zepplin, The Black Crowes, Bob Dylan, the lyrical genius of Warren Zevon, and a Nashville influence rolled into one musical masterpiece.  Whoever thought someone singing sooo off key would sound so...so refreashing (Conquest)! Thank you, White Stripes for doing what you do.  It's good to know there is still creativity alive and well out there!  This is what rock's all about. Now I must go out and buy five other albums! (I can't help it, this shows my age...cd's and downloads will always be albums to me!)
0,I love Dean Martin...
0,What's great about BNL is that they write intelligent music.  None of this mamby-pamby stuff that any brainless music fan can listen to--NO SIR!  You actually have to THINK about what they're singing.  Plus they sing about things nobody sings about these days--being a millionaire, when they were in 9th grade, being "crazy".  They're so entertaining, it's not even funny.	"$100000000" is a hilariously-entertaining song, not to mention clever, witty, and of course, SILLY.	"Grade 9" is a humorous look back thru BNL's high school years--it's quite catchy as well	A great album to own
0,I suspect that the reviewers who only give this less than 4 stars do not have an appreciation for traditional Chinese music.  Much traditional Asian music is designed to evoke a specific mood in the listener.  In contrast, Western tunes usually tell a story. Westerners, therefore, need a different mindset when approaching Eastern music.		This is a gorgeous CD; the songs are flawlessly executed with great depth of feeling and with an exquisite, rich tone.  Although usually heard performed on traditional instruments, the Chinese songs (on this CD) translate wonderfully on the classical guitar, and the moods they create can be intense. Xuefei's performance wonderfully captures their Chinese cultural essence, occasionally using techniques not heard in western classical guitar music. I doubt if any other artist could have been as effective.  Sit back, relax, and be ready to be transported to a place far, far away.  Congratulations to the artist and her marvelous talent.  Very Highly Recommended!
0,This is an even better album than Be Not Nobody -  the lyrics and vocals  and everything about it is superb!  It's not radio-friendly pop like Be Not Nobody was. Fav songs on this cd are:  Annie  and Half A Week Before the Winter.
0,I was already a fan of El-P. The partnership with Killer Mike is awesome.
0,Bought this for my wife. She loves it! CD functions just fine with no problems.
0,TOP NOTCH ALL THE WAY!!! GREAT STUFF!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA++++++++++++++++++
0,nothing to say
0,All combined in one artist.  Britney, Mariah, Christina, even Jewel, take note: you don't have to sound like a four-year-old girl to be a successful female vocalist.  Fiona's voice is deep and haunting, but not a monotone  -- check out the jazz stylings on "Fast as you Can" if you don't  believe me.  The lyrics are clever, world-weary, and wise, they seem  written by someone who's been around the world two or three times.  There  are no cheap romantic sentiments or mindless get-up-and-dance shout-outs.  Even the musical arrangements carry more weight than, say, your average  ex-Mouseketeer album.  There are no hollow spaces; piano, drum, and what  sounds like a large jazz combo fill in the blanks with twisting, sinuous  clouds of deeply textured music, with the occasional oboe and sitar thrown  in for good measure.  When The Pawn is a big album (from the title on), a  four-course dinner instead of a snack, but it will still leave you wanting  more.
0,Phoenix is a delicious treat created by progressive rock veterans Geoff Downes (keyboards), Steve Howe (guitars), Carl Palmer (drums) and John Wetton (bass and vocals). Most listeners will remember this group of talented British musicians from the early 80's when they were young and new to the music scene. They experienced great success with their first album entitled Asia which produced several hit songs and a fetching salary. Fast forward to the year 2008 and we find these same British gentlemen a good deal older, wiser and just as talented as that first forray into our musical world. From the rocking opener Never Again, to the anthemic sing-along An Extaordinary Life, this CD is filled with soaring keyboards, beautiful vocal harmonies, impressive guitars and solid drumming. The subject matter for some of the songs suggests the writer has been around the block for sure. There is one song in particular that I'm sure will be heard when sending off a loved one to the great unknown and that is the beautiful and haunting "I Will Remember You". If you have ever lost anyone close, this will surely start the waterworks flowing. My personal favorite is "Parallel Worlds/Vortex/Deya" which is simply beautiful. Most of the songs on Phoenix are what I would call "Mellow Rock" due to the pop flavor over a progressive vibe. Still these great tunes are not going to be heard on the radio which overplays little boy bands with long bangs and blondes with bleached teeth. I highly recommend this album to those who like bands such as Yes, Genesis, Rush, ELP. Fans of Asia probably already own it. - Ciao
0,I have nowhere near the level of knowledge that Mr. Glasser has. Gormand bordering on slob best describes me when it comes to music, music which keeps me alive. You see, I hate period instruments.  I like my music as if I were in a THX theatre, but I do love solo piano and especially reductions. That aside,I own  a half-dozen or so renditions of Keyboard Concerto No. 1, it's my favorite.  Another of my favs is the Overture from Orchestral Suite No. 1, and of that I have 8.  My favorite, and I mention it only because it is, is by Neville Marriner, which sounds nothing like any of the others.  There is something very grand in Marriner's conducting and he uses modern instruments with no apologies.  I enjoyed "A Strage Beauty", and it too sort of stands alone, but there was something eerie about it, as if a bit anomalous. I can always find some reason to enjoy all the works on this CD, but would it be my "go-to"?  I think after a while I'll see if I sill feel the same way This would make  a nice addition to your library, nevertheless.
0,I have been into Iron maiden since 1981, one of my favourite top 3 bands of all time. This is a good DVD because it gives you a good insight into the band and a lot of  things they do when not on stage performing. fans all over the world react like lunatics to the Maiden. Loved the additional footage of them performing at a wedding in Eastern Europe, they crank out Smoke on the Water. This is a really good DVD, highly recommended.
0,I love this CD.  It is sweet, funny, and you won't be disappointed.  The family must of had a great time putting this together.  Thank you all for some great Christmas fun.
0,BIG DADDY is another great album for John Mellencamp, continuing the musical experiments of THE LONESOME JUBILEE, but with less preachy lyrics. There's even a cover of the Hombres' garage classic "Let It All Hang Out" to lighten things up further. Mellencamp's belief that the Indonesian drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist was unjust adds weight to this CD.
0,Anyone who was maybe less than thrilled with Radiohead's more outright cerebral outings in Kid A & Amnesiac will be pleased to know that their latest 'Hail to the Thief' is full of energy, spunk, and Thom Yorke's trademark lyrical barbs. Yorke lays out a full plate of jabs at the power hungry who seem to be taking over, it's a call to arms to stand up because "you haven't been paying attention" he tells us in the rocking opening "2+2=5". Yorke's vocals are brought to the fore-front and he's never sounded so fleshed out, confident, melodic, and intense. The record definitely has the feel of a band working together, proof that the test these songs got at live shows last year worked.	The balance between old and new is met nearly perfectly with the electronics being used as more of a compliment to song buidling, instead of the main course as was the case at times in the 2 previous efforts. The first single "There There" is the prime example, featuring 3 band members playing percussion with a nice arrangement, but with some anthemic guitar work kicking up in the middle. "Go to Sleep" fits that mold as well with it's groundwork of acoustic guitars building up to a more sonic blast climax. "Sail to the Moon" is "Pyramid Song" reborn, while something like "A Punch Up at the Wedding" is almost an r&b groove, something new, as is the big fuzz bass of "Myxomatosis".	Radiohead fans will rejoice at this effort, both new and old, no matter if they want 'The Bends' part 2 or not. This is probably the true stepping stone between the past and future, only a couple years late. Wether it can turn someone onto Radiohead that hasn't connected with them in the past is hard to tell, but it's certainly something worth their time to invest in to see.
0,great album--came in 3 days--Great
0,Imagine you could vomit into one of those super water squirt guns and then blast out your puke at passers by.  That is the sex pistols.  if you never once wanted to tell people to eff off then you may not like this .  But most peoople from time to time get pissed .  So its great to have a few music recorddings relating such (only so much love songs one can take).		Many bands-Stooges, Ramones, New York Dolls-came before the pistols.  And many of the bands at the time --Pink Floyd, Steely Dan, Fleetwod Mac--were not so horrible anyways.  But the Sex Pistols really showed that a bunch of  not so especially gifted working class dudes could really surpass Pink Floyd , Steely Dan etc in relevance.  And they had a better gimmick than the stooges and ramones-shock and not just iggy pop rolling in glass shock the pistols took on everyone and everything.		In any case I never saw them live or anything and didn't really hear this record until 1983.  It really sounds good after drinking a few beers but not for doing homework or chores around the house.  Chris Stein as the producer really derserves credit not so much for embellishing the sound like sound producers would but instead managing to somehow piece it together.  I would really be suprised if the pistols sounded as good live as on this disc.  Steve Jones plays some basic power chords guitar with lots of reverb and distortion.  Its very up tempo though which would be one of the main aspects of punk vs heavy metal.  punk was about playing fast as well as loud.  Johnny Rotten sings and screams but with undeniable charisma.  though Malcom Jones has been since despised by members of the band he deserves a lot of credit for leveraging the sensationalistic aspect .  You can see that from the dayglo green and pink cover , type face and song titles.  All and all its like a crazy street person that gets your attention on your way home from a dull work day.  A brilliant attack on boredom.
0,I really do enjoy listening to Barney Kessel.  His jazz style is great.  Love the records Wish there were more records
0,This is a wonderful CD. I don't think you will be disappointed....even if you aren't familiar with Josh Groban. His voice is superb!
0,I love this song
0,Ah ... an eye-opener so to speak ... I finally understand  Herbert von Karajan's ultimate aim in a performance. I always wondered WHY Karajan conducts with his eyes completely closed??? Listening to his final recording ... my eyes are opened ... or should I say my heart and soul are open to the great heart and soul of this magnificent symphony. Music has the ability to transport us into the spiritual meditative world somewhere out there ... but only if we can tune into the heart and soul of the composer ... as Pablo Casals wisely tells us: "Music is the divine way of telling beautiful poetic things to the heart." Karajan is in a trance-like state where the glorious beauty of Bruckner's creation is flowing from his heart through the musicians' hearts to our heart ... absolute magic!!! It's a miracle to me how he can be so controlling while at the same time being the font of spiritual musical truth and beauty. How can he accomplish this without tears??? I suppose having his eyes closed helps!	Have any of you dear readers ever stood in front of an orchestra playing a divine adagio? Have any of you felt the soulful playing vibrations of a cello section floating an exquisite melody such as the first melody of this rapturous creation? There is simply NO feeling like it and Karajan knows exactly what he wants in the way of beautiful sound ... and NOBODY could wring that beauty out of an orchestra as he does ... with his eyes closed!	I have many often-played recordings of this "Lyric" seventh and I love Wand, Jochum and Karajan's Berlin recording ... and especially Bohm's ... but this last recording of Karajan is special ... a desert island disk to play when you need great spirit, truth and beauty. Again, ABSOLUTE MAGIC ... what more can I say?
0,Great
0,No one can deny that Dirty Dancing contained great music that really made you want get up and have some fun.  This colledtion combines both soundtrack albums released (Dirty Dancing / More Dirty Dancing) with a few bonus tracks previously not available and a small booklet.	Of the bonus tracks, only the extended movie version of "Time Of My Life" is worth much intrest.  It's a bit odd that the radio version isn't included as well, but it is nice to hear the full length song for once.  The other bonus tracks are instrumental versions of "Time Of My Life" that are actually excerpts from the score instead of full length dubs.  One runs 41 seconds, the other 58 seconds.  My one real gripe with the set is that the total running time of both CD's is just about 75 minutes.  That's just enough to fit on one disc and should have been done to save the consumer some money.  Also it would've been nice to have the songs presented in the order they appeared in the film.	The discs are stored in the front and back flaps of a hard bound CD book with a 24 page booklet between them.  The booklet has many stills from the film (most retouched through a colored filter) and a few behind the scenes shots as well.  I would've liked to see a directors note or an overview of the "Dirty Dancing" phenomonon, but overall the packaging is done very well and only enhaces the feel of a special collectors item.	I've awarded four stars because there's just not enough offered for someone who already owns both soundtracks and is not a manic fan of the film like myself.  There are minor things that could have been done (ie; putting all tracks on one disc in the films order of appearance, including both versions of "Time Of My Life") that would've made the "Collectors Edition" something really special.  However this is the perfect set for those that don't already own both Dirty Dancing soundtracks.  It's a great collection of music that makes great beach music and is sure to liven up parties or a bad day.  If you don't have it yet, you MUST get it now.
0,Five stars. This is exactly the type of performance that listeners have received in the past from Deutch Grammophone and the well known and impeccable conductor Karajian in the past. The tradition continues.
0,Torche's follow up to their self-titled debut is a mighty monolith of pop melodies caked over-top a sludge powered rocket engine hurtling itself into the sun. This is some mighty, mighty, mighty awesome music, whatever your musical sensibilities may be, because, as opposed to other "doom metal" acts, the music Torche craft on this album retain a sense of happiness, like a blissful smile painted on the face of a person lost in a pair of headphones. The whole of this album has a huge potential for radio play, it is that accessible. As stated above, it seems similiar to the Foo Fighters at times, just vastly contorted, as if it were being transmitted from some rock radio station in a different dimension where stoners rule as the status quo.	My only complaints about this album are the sometimes haphazard transitions between songs, and it's meager length (I can't get enough, I fear that my copy will be ruined from being overplayed). Besides those relatively small gripes, Meanderthal is an excellent album that anyone who likes rock music at all will be able to appreciate.
0,I can't really talk right now, I'm still in shock :)
0,I would of given this DVD five stars because it's a great CD, but the case was cracked and this was the second time this has happened.  No bit deal because your listening to the CD but I kind of like my cases to be in one piece when it arrives.
0,good
0,Five stars for the concert, but...		...on the day that this DVD has been released, the news has come that Pink Floyd co-founder Syd Barrett has died at the age of 60.		Shine on, Syd.
0,This is my favorite Bowie album, brilliant and original and mysterious.	My only problem is that Some Are and All Saints, the 2 additional tracks added to the Rykodisc release, are so good and add to the experience so much that any subsequent release without them makes the album feel incomplete. If the Rykodisc version is 5 stars, taking 2 great songs away cannot also be 5 stars.
0,As Pete Townshend has previously stated, this album represented his peak in terms of creativity in music. And he's totally right. Quadrophenia is his baby, but also the best Who album ever too. Even if all songs here are of his authority, the amazing final result could have not been achieved without the collaboration of the rest band members. Indeed, you can verify this fact by listening the demos included in this deluxe edition. Although Pete's rough and initial version of the songs of the album sounds great, you can tell that something is missing: the whole contribution of the band.	Despite that, the remaster of the songs sounds awesome, specially in regard of Keith Moon's drums, which remarcably adds more power to the whole record.	If you have doubts in buying this version considering past releases my recommendation is to go for this one. Is the definite experience to listen to the best Who album ever.
0,A new mature offering from prog's greatest contributor.
0,good cd
0,Lot of hit songs on this debut for the fame. A new legend is born take notice.
0,Nothing before or since sounds like Roxy's debut effort. It lurches all over the map, including bits of loud rock, odd tape samples, heavily ironic takes on pop music, 50's rock-n-roll & some stuff you can't even identify. Some times, all in the same song. Roxy Music probably paid a heavy commercial price the rest of their career for this album, since it indelibly tagged them as arty weirdos long after their sound changed completely. Nonetheless, it is terrific on its own merits. Anyone with a taste for the unusual (but not atonal) should consider this a must-have.	For those whose image of Roxy is the Siren-to-Avalon dreamy mood, this does not even resemble that band. Eno's influence was at its zenith on the debut. Not the ambient Eno, but the madcap cut-&-paste pop pastiche Eno. Plenty of loud guitar, greasy sax & Paul Thompson pounding the drums to leaven the mayhem. All in all, lots of fun interspersed with a serious dose of "what in the world was that?"
0,This DVD is awesome.  Both the sound and the picture are great.  This show is also available on CD, which came out in 2000.  I had been looking forward to the DVD for a long time and it was well worth it.  I saw Roger Waters in West Palm on the 2000 leg of the In The Flesh tour, and with the DVD I can relive the show over and over again.	I recommend this DVD to any Floyd/Waters fan.
0,I have to say that once I heard this disc, it made me think, "what else have I been missing?"  I never realized that such enveloping music existed.  I had never heard anything like this before, and as soon as I had, I was hooked.  Anyone would like this.  I have showed it to a variety of people who all have different tastes in music, and everyone loves it.  There is no way for me to describe how excellent this CD is.  I have had it for 5 months now, listen to it faithfully, and am still not sick of it.  To anyone who has come across this disc and is reading this review, BUY IT.  You will not be sorry.  You wouldn't be reading this if it wasn't related to what you wanted.
0,Uh-oh, a follow-up to a much-loved Britpop album. That can only spell "high expectations." And that's the major problem with "Free the Bees," an otherwise lovely sophomore album by the British pop band. They shift their sound a bit, but retain the lush 60s influences and bright melodies.		Their first album was pieced together in much rougher circumstances -- in fact, it was stuck together in a garden shed. So the Bees get to make their sound a bit more polished this time around. It's perhaps not coincidental that they recorded "Free the Bees" at Abbey Road, since they seem to have soaked in the summery psychedelic vibe of the sixties.		That's most evident in songs like "Wash In The Rain," a summery pop tune that is washed in Hammond organ, or "One Glass of Water," a charmingly retro sound that is completely catchy and sweet. And they stray a bit from the sound with "Horseman," which is more influenced by harder rock from a decade later on. And "Chicken Payback" is nothing but hilarious.		The Bees (formerly "Band of Bees") are not known for their originality. They're known for making good pop music. Their music absolutely reeks of the summer of love, and they obviously are influenced by plenty of older bands, wandering happily from sixties psychedelica to seventies rock. But with that in mind, their music is warm and refreshing.		The best word to describe the music is bouncy -- the Bees call on snappy drums and cheery basslines and guitar riffs for their sound, as well as some deeply moving Hammond organ. To finish off the sound, they inject some harmonies that would make the Zombies wipe away a tear of pride.		Those looking for a bit of sun in the middle of winter might need this. The Bees sound very retro in their second album, but seem to be having plenty of fun as they travel back in time.
0,Freddie Hubbard's inaugural record as a leader is also the first in series of stellar, stellar records he put out on Blue Note in the '60s. Just an amazingly vital run.		There's only one original composition on the set (Hub's Nub) but it is a scorcher.		The lineup on Hubbard's records would improve as time went on (especially the drum slot) but start at the beginning and get a taste of what was to come.
0,This music never gets old!
0,great guitar playing great songs  good party cd  put it on and wait for people to come to you asking "this is GREAT !  Who is this???"
0,this cd will get ya dancing  enough said.  great melodies,vocals,instrumentaion, its more rock than country  but thats why i love this band
0,Perfect version!
0,Excellent
0,Record is great. A little pricey compared to Discogs, but wanted the security of an Amazon transaction. Record is near mint and sounds amazeballs.
0,There is no weak song on this CD, get it!		Besides the commercial releases, I love "Native Son" and "Rebel", fantastic songs Bryan!!!
0,Waiting for the sirens' call will NOT hook you immediately. It's not that kind of album. There are no some instant hits, except Who's Joe, Krafty or Jetstream.	When I played it the first time I was kind of bored. Too many songs didn't hook me, sounded just "ok" and after Get Ready, I was disappointed.	Days passed and I didn't play the album - didn't want to! However, when I played it again after a week or so, out of nowhere, I started to like the songs! One by one, they PERFECTLY matched each other - carrying specific mood and great production.		Now I think it's the best thing they released in years - much better than, for example, Republic and on par if not better with Get Ready (I like that album very much).	It's incredible how this album works! If you like New Order, you'll certainly love this album. Do NOT expect to like it on the first listen! You probably won't - maybe just 3-4 songs!		This album has some ultimate NO gems and classics: Who's Joe?, Waiting for the siren's call, Hey now what you doing, Dracula's Castle, Turn. They are magnificent!		Every song is good - there are no fillers here. I don't like "I told you so" that much - interesting, but not my cup of tea, and "Guilt is a useless emotion" has some kind of generic chorus. That's a shame, considering that the song starts extremely well! Just the chorus isn't that memorable. But great for a summer fun! :)		All in all, a very very solid effort. As the time goes by, I expect that I'll like this album even more. It's THAT kind of a record. So refreshing these days - I'm fed up of instant hits that I get bored with after few weeks/months.		Update (june 2nd): I didn't want to edit this review, so I made this update. Just wanted to add that I absolutely like ALL tracks now! It's the best thing I've heard in long long time, like 4-5 years or so. Possibly the best album of 2005. (I hope Depeche Mode will come with something similar, quality wise!)
0,Like the Immaculate Collection, this is a greatest hits package but this  time round, Madonna reveals her softer side. So much controvesy has swirled  around her career, no attention ever gets paid to her music was what she  said. And truly indeed. You will find some of the most compeeling Madonna  ballads here like the classics Crazy For You, Live To Tell, Rain, Oh Father  and the #1 smash Take A Bow! But it is really the remake of Marvin Gaye  song I Want You, remade with UK trip-hop outfit Massive Attack. Madonna  injects sensuality into the classic and brings out a whole new  interpretation. The David Forster collaboration "One More Chance"  is a no frills acoustic effort with guitar, something totally unheard of in  early Madonna!
0,If you have never heard this, buy it. You'll love it!
0,Beegie Adair does it again. The best in piano and this time she is accompanied with an orchestra. Beautiful. Two friends purchased the CD after listening to mine. Can't go wrong with any of Ms. Adair"s CDs. Her music transports you from beginning to end.
0,Peter Maag was a superb conductor who pitifully has been forgotten for a remarkable audience. His sumptuous and noble style, the perfect articulation of the harmonic languages, color tonal, mercurial lyricism and adequate melodic balance, fit out to play Mendelssohn a colorist composer.		Herder and Goethe in literature and the composers Mendelssohn and Bruch were perhaps, the most enthusiastic artists engaged by this dreamingly land.		According Donald Tovey the second musical motive in the First Movement of the "Scottish" has been to his mind the most expressive and inspired melody ever written. The certain is that this Symphony remains not only as one of the most expansive and delirious Symphonic works ever written. Mendelssohn 's muse reached a peak hard to climb even by himself. We would have to wait for the Fifth Symphony to enjoy such enraptured inspiration and magic spell.		I have to remark that version is after the unbeatable Munch 's Boston Symphony, the most expressive and eloquent version that I have listened. The pureness and grace; the charm and lyricism literally float as a cloud around the members of the orchestra of the London Symphony.		In the Hebrides; we must employ a well known French expression: Chapeaux!. It is simply overwhelming. Elegant phrasing and  aristocratic conception conform this beauty Overture.		Midnight summer 's dream finds two serious rivals: Ferenc Fricsay and Rafael Kubelik. But a deserved third place behind these two mesmerizing readings definitively confirms the status that many times we use to forget around the figure of this legendary director.
0,These songs will not disappoint anyone who knows his music, I enjoy listening to all of them. You'll love his duet with Colbie Caillat. Even my middle-schooler likes him now..
0,Hard core Bowie fans hate this album, because it was "commercial" and light, and lacked the angst of "Scary Monsters" or "Lodger."  At the time, it seemed like it was an enjoyable album of the moment, picking up on the dance rhythms that had taken over the airwaves by the mid-80s.  With hindsight, it is musically a lot more sturdy than that, and seems like a minor classic.  Don't follow biography that closely, but I suspect Bowie was just in a good mood then, and that impacted his music, giving it a jolly quality his CD's typically lack. The beats are beautifully constructed, and it is a very pleasing meeting of rock and dance aesthetics.
0,When this album was released, it was to coinside with the "Sex" book and the film "Body of Evidence." First off, the book and movie - they were great! Anyways, the album got lost in a Madonna backlash  and a lot of people didn't get it. S&M? Oral Sex? Oh no! It's the Right  Wing! Listen, after the few sex songs, there are some excellent tracks,  "Thief of Hearts," "Words," "Rain," "Bad  Girl," "Bye Bye Baby," "Secret Garden." All of  them rock. "In This Life" is about AIDS, and although a sad song,  kind of slow and boring. And "Did You Do It?" Hello cheese! Two  white guys rapping about sleeping with Maddy. Big fun - not! There are more  good tracks then bad on this CD, so don't miss out!
0,I think this is the single best Bill Frisell album.  I call it a Bill Frisell album because it is his musical sensibilities that dominate the feel of the album as a whole.  Not surprisingly the playing by Dave Holland and Elvin Jones is fantastic; it doesn't specially feel like their other work, though.  It has much more the spacy, moody feel of Frisell.  I would recommend this as one of the 10 or so most important albums for someone trying to get a sense for the directions of modern jazz music.  This is not jazz in any traditional sense, but it is music made by players deeply embedded in the jazz tradition, coupled with the pursuit of originality that has characterized jazz music from its inception.  This is one of my favourite albums, and I especially appreciate its demonstration of the incredible musical power that can be mustered by a trio; (not unlike, in that sense, the album "Question and Answer," by Pat Metheny, Dave Holland and Roy Haynes).
0,this is the most successful album metallica has ever put out. it is in fact still doin a phenomenal job. many call metallica "sell out" b/c of this album but you have to admit that this is good music. i cannot skip any second of this album. it's just simply brilliant. the words, the rythm, the guitar solos (props to kirk!!!!!!!), i can't possibly say enough. it's just amazing. which is why metallica is my favorite band of all time. i don't see 'em goin anywhere anytime soon. i just wish that they will put out another one just like this. buy this! it's worth the money
0,I own so many Diana Ross CD's and vinyl albums.  She is one of my favorite singers!  I picked this up at a quite affordable price today used and I love it.  The sound quality and selection is great and it combines both Motown and RCA titles.  I don't see any rhyme or reason to the sequencing but in this day and age of uploading and shuffling songs around on MP3 players and Ipods that's neither here nor there...although the energy does turn up a bit from Track 13 (It's My Turn...big ballad) to Track 16 (Swept Away...big dance tune).  The sound is even and splendid throughout.  The big plus for me in purchasing this CD was the outstanding liner notes AND fantastic archive pictures of Diana Ross.  Between the music, notes & pictures it's quite a complete and satisfying collection.
0,The Carpenters were the best.
0,All these years later, having listened to Electric Lady Land until the groves wore out, it was wonderful to be able to see the "behind the scenes" workings of the making of the record. Watching, as Eddie Kramer isolates the original tracks, allowing us all to hear Jimi singing and playing "in the raw" is an awesome sight and sound to behold. I've watched this DVD over and over again, savoring every moment.
0,All too rarely do I come to a Broadway show with minimal expectations and come away feeling like I experienced something quite magical. Like many others, I saw the minor&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/2006-indie-film/dp/B000X1Z0BU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">2006 indie film</a>&nbsp;upon which this musical was based and liked it. I certainly liked it enough to buy the accompanying&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/soundtrack-CD/dp/B000PFU7OO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">soundtrack CD</a>&nbsp;because of that soaring love song the two principals, Glen Hansard and Markta Irglov, performed in the piano shop, "Falling Slowly". It was a lovely scene in a small movie that promptly went into the inner recesses of my fading memory bank. Now six years later comes the Broadway production, which beautifully expands on the film's insular focus on the couple to include a dozen talented musician/actors to provide the core love story much-needed dimension in order to fill the stage for he audience. The same approach also adds dimension to the 2012 original cast recording which thanks to producers Steve Epstein and Martin Lowe, does an excellent job of capturing the liveliness of the show's Dublin pub setting as well as the melancholic attraction between the mismatched, unnamed pair.		Eight of the thirteen songs from the film have been retained, and Lowe's orchestrations build on Hansard's and Irglov's songs with both inventive spirit and becalming restraint. The story is basically the same as the movie - a spunky Czech migr takes notice of a reticent Irish street musician where she becomes entranced by the passion of his talent. His character's self-penned songs - all written by Hansard and Irglov - reflect the still-broken heart he has over a break-up with a girl who had moved to New York, a circumstance that the girl can relate to as she is a lonely young mother unsure whether she will go back to her husband back in Prague. Their relationship evolves into something deeper and not altogether unexpected. At the same time, it becomes clear that the music they create is what will always bond them regardless of where they go. The centerpiece of the recording is, of course, the Oscar-winning "Falling Slowly", performed first as the semi-spontaneous duet it was in the film version and then reprised at the end to sum up the story with genuine poignancy. Steve Kazee plays the pained street musician/vacuum cleaner repairman. Onstage, he was a revelation as Guy, and he captures the troubadour portion of his performance here with unrelenting passion and power.		As a Kentuckian, Kazee doesn't have Hansard's hangdog brogue or bar-band edge, but he fluently conveys the pain inherent in the now-familiar songs with a purer sense of conviction in a more varied set of arrangements. He manages to lend quiet introspection to "Gold", while his intensely personal versions of "Leave" and "When Your Mind's Made Up" are particularly heartbreaking. More powerfully than Irglov, Cristin Milioti sings in a crystalline Bjrk-like voice that unexpectedly soars on her spotlight solo numbers, "If You Want Me" and "The Hill". At the same time, she harmonizes quite nicely with Kazee. The additional songs elevate the energy level by bridging key scenes. The harmonies in "Moon" are great and really evoke the pub setting with clarity, as does "Abandoned in Bandon", a minute-long Irish drinking song performed by some of the incidental characters. To highlight the Girl's immediate family, there is even a traditional Czech number, "Ej Pada Pada Rosicka", which adds some much-needed ethnic zest to a score that otherwise relishes its Gaelic spirit. As a whole, the recording is incredibly charming and envelopes the listener like an old friend. It's a true beauty.
0,I am no expert on all the various versions of this symphony but I had the Rattle version for years and it just never did it for me. I had concluded that the symphony wasn't for me.  I also have the Bernstein on DG which is better but nowhere as awesome as this recording by Boulez. One reviewer stated that this recording is great for the  sound effects achieved by the conductor. While I agree with that assessment, this recording is so much more. Boulez knows how to handle the enormity and complexity of this symphony like perhaps only a few conductors on the planet. The result is a very focused, tight, amazing sounding recording. And there is NOTHING cold or sterile about this performance. The last movement has all the requisite emotion you could ask for without going overboard.
0,love this record since I first bought it in 1979.... in Spain Disco music was so rare on the disco era, I had to order it in the store & took almost a month to arrive.... love it... Deodato's production, master of rhythm..
0,Great!
0,A real treat to see two of my long-time heroes together again.  Clapton's 2007 Crossroads Festival is what turned me on to seeing Winwood/Clapton together again after all these years, and I must admit that this disc doesn't quite see the lads catching fire as they did at the 2007 Festival.  But for such a great collection of music, that may be nit-picking.
0,This is a notoriously bad album.  Out of print for years, most people seem to think it was the essence of everything that "went wrong" with the Pretenders when it became a pseudonym for "Chrissie Hynde and various musicians."  But honestly it's one of my favorite Pretenders albums!  Sure it's more produced and more ballad-friendly than early Pretenders albums, but it's not bad at all.  Nothing terribly schmaltzy like "I'll Stand by You," and a few really great songs like "Never Do That," "Criminal," and "Sense of Purpose."
0,Le Nozze di Figaro is my favorite opera... so far.	I cannot give enough praise for Ferruccio Furlanetto who sings the role of Figaro in this recording.  He is fabulous, and I think it might have something to do with his being Italian.  He is passionately angry in Se vuol ballare.  He sings this aria as if he's done a thousand times, and yet he manages to make it fresh, engaging.  So what if he's done it a thousand times, he's a baritone and Mozart is what singers do.  We should expect that he's sung all Mozart arias for baritone a thousand times each.  But despite this, the aria isn't boring.  In fact it's the best I've ever heard anyone sing it.	Dawn Upshaw sings Suzanna with much art, she's a great performer.  But honestly, and I hate saying this about a millionaire while I'm not one, I grew weary of her voice toward the end of Act I.  Her tone didn't change but I began to perceive it as a bit screechy.	Anne Sophie von Otter is not my favorite Cherubino.  Her lines are a bit too studied.  Troyanos is absolutely awesome as Marchellina, so much so that when she and Suzanna fight in the first act, Troyanos' voice wins out even though in the libretto it is Suzanna that appears to have won that little battle.  Troyanos is ever the easier to listen to, God rest her soul.	Kiri Te Kanawa is incomparable as the Countess.  After all these years of playing this role, it still belongs to her and with good reason.  Her tone is rich, her plight apparent, and we never get tired.	I may be alone on this point, but I actually like Levine's conducting.  I like his slow pace.  I like hearing every single last little note so masterfully put into place by Mozart.  True, during some parts I do lament the slow pace and wish for something a little more fast paced and delightfully comical, something truer (to coin a word) to the spirit of Mozart and of this opera.	But the reason I chose this particular version of this much recorded opera is because of Thomas Hampson.  He's cute. Undeniably so.  And he's convincingly evil and leacherous as Count Almaviva.  I love to hate him in this role.  His performance is manipulatively seductive.  In fact this is what made me late buy a recording of Don Giovanni with Hampson in the title role.  But I think he is even more of a Don in this, Le Nozze di Figaro.
0,Toto's musical fame was too short lived for me.  They  got alot of exposure from MTV, when albums were still selling. But alot of their terriffic music never got played. I realized I missed their sound. So I did a search on Amazon. Well I found what I was looking for. Great CD, alone or combine on playlist with Billy Ocean, Sade, Cars, and alike.	Dave
0,Classic sound and performance!
0,Slipknot are frequently lumped into the already oversaturated nu-metal crowd, and while the Des-Moines, Iowa-raised group does have a nu-ish appearance (as each of these nine band members is clad in orange jumpsuits, makeup, and masks), and an anti-establishment-inspired, middle-digit-to-the-world anger about them, and is even occasionally heard taking musical ventures into nu-metal-esque territory (with a DJ and near-rapped vocals), they are miles and miles removed from the Limp Bizkits and Linkin Parks of the world. And true, their eponymous 1999 debut might also feature some Korn-esque downtuned guitars and Helmet-like stop-start rhythms.	But this record actually has as much (if not more) in common with the death and thrash genres than anything else. And heck, its intensity is so severe throughout that one might even argue that it borders on being worthy of grindcore.		Frontman Corey Taylor wages war on his demons throughout these pummeling fourteen tracks, ranting and raging about various catalysts that set him off into the deep end over a uber-abrasive musical bed of bludgeoning riffs, rubbery bass, and brutal drumming -- yes, even including some death metal-derived blast beat drumming. (Joey cements his status as one of heavy music's premier young skinsmen by nailing brutal fills pretty much all throughout this hour-long playing time.)		It all begins with "742617000027," a simple (but loopy and trippy), sample-laden intro track which sets the stage and flows perfectly into "(Sic)," which oozes with pounding guitars, throbbing bass lines, and tight, pummeling blast beats. It also slips in some catchy and well-placed DJ scratches. And Corey tops it all off by coming screaming into (or, more accurately, over the top of) the mix, viscerally hollering lines like "You can't kill me!" (albeit without ever exactly explaining why anybody might want to), and climaxing with some skin-crawlingly maniacal laughter. "Eyeless," then, is similarly filled with more positively crazy vocals, including some full-bodied, larynx-shredding bellows of "mother effer" that will be instinctively memorable, whether you want them to be or not.		The record's lead single, "Wait And Bleed" is not exactly a power ballad, but it is about as close to being one as you're going to find on the album, as it is the catchiest (and cleanest) song to be had, here, and even features some genuine crooning from Taylor. But immediately following "W&B" comes the really scathing and livid "Surfacing," which just might be the record's most extreme tune, and one that boasts the type of chorus that is easy to imagine going on to inspire ginormous mosh pits around the globe. Indeed, the headbanging intensity is so in the red throughout this track that the listener can feel it pulsing through their body, from their head to their toes. And following this up comes "Spit It Out," another hit single, and an insanely catchy one at that, as it is filled with deft DJ scratching and swift, fluid rapping.		You might call me crazy for saying this, but I feel like "Slipknot"'s second half does not seem to stack up quite as well as the first track did, as it feels like the energy level drops significantly. And there are is the occasional forgettable song to be found in it, too, including "Me Inside" and "Diluted" (although, to its credit, the former of these two cuts does feature some borderline soaring clean singing.) But there are certainly other standout tracks to be found, here, like the spooky, mind-trip of an interlude that is "Tattered & Torn" (and, subsequently, the spine-tingling "Prosthetics"), and "Liberate," which is coursing with memorable, pummeling, churning, chest-caving guitar and bass riffs, and esophagus-shredding screams.		And although not as memorable as the above, "No Life" is a surprisingly catchy, and (naturally) very mosh-intensive number; "Only One" features an excellent and epic energy build-up and climax; and "Scissors" is a sprawling, slowly-burning, nineteen-plus minute long epic that brings the album's curtain to a close with the sound of Taylor verging on full-fledged crying.		The bottom line here is simple enough to understand because it all boils down to this: "Slipknot" is one heckuva debut, a landmark even, from an iconic band whose dark, angsty attitude defined a generation. So no matter what subgenre this album falls under, if you are into heavy music, it is definitely a must hear.
0,If you buy Tim and Let It Be only, and don't buy this, then you are missing the best cd they ever made. Alex Chilton, Valentine , Nevermind (where do ya think nirvana got the name?), can't hardly wait, almost every  song rocks ('cept skyway and night club jittters)and every song has the  best lyrics Paul ever wrote: if you were a pill, i'd grab a handful at my  will, and wash them down with something sweeeeeeeeet and strong............
0,Lil Wayne is a force to be reckoned with in this rap game. This guy is so talented. Every track is a hit!!!!!
0,not their best album, but worth the price of admission for rush fans. the 5.1 mix is good. worth getting for the rush fan that likes 5.1. i am hoping permanent waves gets done in this format. 2112, moving pictures, signals and farewell to kings were good choices but i am hoping permanent waves gets done in this format.
0,...when I heard "Lose Yourself" I was hypnotised. I have never heard more powerful lyrics in my life. More importantly, I felt that the song had a POSITIVE message which is rare for Eminem. Anyway since this soundtrack is the only place to get it, i would highly recommend this soundtrack. As for the other tracks they are very good.... BUY IT!
0,Always had this on vinyl. Decided to have the CD.
0,i bought this box set the day it came out and i listenined to all the tracks as soon as i got it. the box set includes songs never realeased plus solos,demos,rehersals,radio appereances,and much more. it even includes a DVD with them playing some of their songs. i really enjoyed this box set this must be like the best album that they have made. this box set probably made alot of money the first day it came out since i know so many people who bought it and enjoyed it
0,Wow.  I had somewhat low expectations for this his first solo record, but Ben Folds came through.. and how!  If anything, he seems much more free and loose, even with the wifey and studio production.  The album itself has a very singer-songwriter bent, and the ups and downs the album takes, as well as the variety, only remind me of Loudon Wainwright III's "Attempted Moustache" a great deal.  In that album from 70something, Wainwright dispelled myths of what pop music should be and lambasted the current status, wrote wife songs, and so many sentimental storylines.  "Rockin' the Suburbs" is an album in that vein, and the title track I think is Folds's "AM World".. Sure, it's not his style, and it may sound like a forced single, but people, that's the point!  HE IS MAKING FUN OF THE STATE OF POP!  God, I love this album.
0,I, like millions, saw the Youtube clip of Susan Boyle's debut to the world on Britain's Got Talent. I'm ashamed to confess that I, also like millions of others, wondered who is this plain looking woman?  When she opened her mouth and belted "I Dreamed A Dream", I was left in tears. Susan Boyle's meteoric rise to fame serves as a reminder to all of us who find it so easy to judge a book by its cover. Thanks to Susan, I now know that beauty comes in all forms. As for her new album, I think the performances are stunning. I'm sure there are those who ponder her choice of songs, however, as the Amazon review points out, she selected songs that resonated with her on an emotional and spiritual level.  For those who wanted more Sondheim, Lerner and Lowe, etc. - just wait, I'm sure there's more to come! This incredibly talented woman will be around for a long time!
0,Jordi Savall really nails it for what I've been looking for with the music on this cd. I'm always looking for music that sounds like it came from 2,000 years ago and I have just loved how Jordi Savall accomplishes this. I love ancient music and bellydancing: this cd is an answer to both of those. His music is time and time again beautiful. I love listening to this cd when I'm meditating, driving, bellydancing, sleeping, etc. Definitely worth the $18 especially with how difficult it is to find an available way to purchase his cds in the U.S. If you like Jordi, I would also recommend his other cds and his daughter, Arianna. Gorgeous voice and musical talent with her as well.
0,August 31, 2008		Back in the middle sixties Gary Lewis (son of the brilliant and venerable comedian Jerry Lewis) backed by The Playboys gave us the kind of music that the fans desperately require today. Gary Lewis and the Playboys were a good time band that by the very rendering of simple boy-girl songs similar to Leslie Gore material made all of us feel happy. That's why we need the group to make a comeback. These are tough times and if a listener begins with a tour of cherished selections such as Just My Style, This Diamond Ring and Everybody Loves a Clown that individual is going to receive an uncomplicated and catchy great rush of happiness. Two facts about Gary Lewis, he was only a great rock and roller, never an actor or comedian and he made it on his own as far as I know. Next, he achieved unimaginable success during the British invasion years when groups were falling like bowling pins against the innovative and much followed UK strongmen like the Beatles, Stones, Moody's and The Who. Gary was not a Peter Frampton looks-plus gentleman. He sang about simple subjects like dating and going out in a way that was completely comforting to his legions of fans. Funny, he is, in 2008 all over satellite, cable music stations and commercial FM oldies and just like Dion, Ben E. King, Neil Diamond, The Righteous Brothers and Neil Sedaka is a recipient of The Flight To Quality that I continue to observe. We as fans and critics are not getting the satisfaction in product that we want when we are now in the era of the talent show. Gary Lewis and The Playboys may now achieve success because the fans have to now get satisfaction by going back.		Jay Adler, Music Critic
0,I have been guilty in the recent past of lumping these guys in with nu-meal ticket rock and other forms of radio gah-gah. I was listening to the radio in my car one day with a friend and a song come on the radio and just before I changed the station I turned to him and asked him if he knew who was playing that crap, he said Lamb of God. But after listening to this album there is noway in HE** that it could have been. There is not one " Hey fans we are going to write a horrible corporate radio song to sell records." song on this entire record and man does it make me fu*king happy to say that, in fact I never realized that I would ever feel that good saying that about hardcore music in my life. But with what is being passed off as heavy/hardcore music i really had no other option. The only reason, and I mean only reason why I didn't give this a resounding 5 STAR is because there are a few songs where I can't tell them apart. But hopefully that will change on the next project and beyond. Great fu*king umcompromising music!!!!!
0,This Clapton box set is a rare treat. There's One In Every Crowd was underated and the Expanded Version of this and 461are well worth the price. Could have done without 3 versions of Ramblin' on the live discs which were already covered by Crossroads II Live, but the Freddie King Sessions were a treat.
0,I'm so impressed that someone put together an amazing collection such as this.  These guys' influence on popular music is immense but undervalued.  Hopefully this set will help remedy the situation.  Three cheers for JSP!
0,love it
0,If the build-up in the musical press was to be believed, Real Emotional Trash was going to be one of the best albums of the decade. But albums rarely live up to the hype that precedes their release and this CD is no exception. So after the hype has evaporated, it is possible to express a dispassionate opinion on a very good but less than masterful album.	I am not a hard-core Stephen Malkmus fan. I own and enjoy several Pavement albums, but none of his previous solo efforts. So what useful can I tell you about this? Well, that if you like Pavement you will probably like this album with his new long-term band, the Jicks. Real Emotional Trash is quintessential and unmistakable Malkmus. There is absolutely no question whose record this is when you hear it for the first time.	Malkmus is known for his eccentric and often inscrutable lyrics backed by a searing guitar attack. You get that in spades here. Though this is no masterpiece, there are some excellent songs here. My favorites are Hopscotch Willie, the title cut, Baltimore, Gardenia, and We Can't Help You.	If you are looking for some rather outre yet enjoyable alt-rock, then you need look no further than this. It will be interesting to hear what the Jicks will come up with next.
0,I think this is how one could describe Macy Gray in general. With her 'Billie Holliday meets Donald Duck' voice, Macy is certainly one of the most unique artists in music history (which is really what makes her so stunning). Her music is, like always, set to catchy (and rather refreshing) 70's style groove and soul. Say what you want, but where Macy never fails is knowing how to make people move and groove. Lyrically, Macy is as outrageous as ever with wacky and totally unique lyrics that nobody else would probably ever dream of creating. Yet again, this is what makes Macy so enjoyable. There is no way to classify her, and I hope she keeps it that way. So far, this album hasn't received a whole lot of attention overseas (where it was released in May). In North America, I'm not sure things will be very different. Without a strong presence on the singles charts, this album will probably not see big numbers (unfortunately). Regardless, this cd contains a lot of hit worthy material.
0,In the late 70's, music was going the way of the skinny tie, and the synthesizer. A more digitized musical world was about to take over, until a young man named Edward Van Halen came on to the scene and changed the  rock-n-roll world forever. One song, I repeat just one song, an  instramental, if I may call it that. That one song  that changed the  rock-n-roll world, was "ERUPTION". Every guitar player in the  world and musician for that matter, put their  guitars down, and were in  total shock and awe. Eruption was the one song that changed it all, but VAN  HALEN's debut album in itself changed everything. Turned the music world  upside down. Single handedly  saved Rock back then. It will always be a  landmark album, and any guitar player, musician, or music lover should have  it in their collection. Long live VH, and thank you for  saving  Rock-n-roll....
0,Neo Soul crooner Dwele divided his new CD "Wants World Women" into three segments each preceded by an intro, a concept album of sorts.		The "Wants" section finds him singing about his material needs/desires on songs like the groovy piano-sprinkled "I wish" (on which he wishes he was as wealthy as people think he is), the incredibly catchy guitar-festooned "Grown", and the smooth "Dim the lights" featuring Raheem DeVaughn.		The "World" section finds him in reflective Marvin Gaye/Curtis Mayfield mood tackling social issues like living on the street, the economy and more on songs like the spectacular Gaye-channeling "How I deal" with Slum Village, the lilting "Hangover", and the Jazzy pair of "My people" and "Detroit sunrise" with Monica Blaire & Lloyd Dwayne.		The "Women" section deals with affairs of the heart on soulful ballads like "I understand", "What's not to love" and "Give me a chance", and groovy club numbers like "Love me right" and "I wanna" with DJ Quik.		Www is an album you will enjoy surfing through. A soulful delight!
0,what a great concert! it must have been great to be there. A good song selection, and the children from Zimbabwe who appear at some of the songs add some flavor to the well known songs from Dispatch. It is truly a gift from Dispatch to their fans, and a must have in the Dispatch collection. I love the songs, and love the concert. Interesting is the part where the 3 guys go down the stage and play a couple unplugged songs on top of the roof of a minivan in the middle of the stadium.		Video and sound quality are great, but I regret there is only one audio mix available, meaning there is no stereo mix available in the Bluray, so you really have to crank up the volume in order to listen.		Despite of the audio issue, this is one of my favorite concert blurays.
0,I first heard this song played live, on a french music station where Tori was giving an interview and performance.  This song took my breath away.  She has such a beautiful voice and ability to write stunning melodies.  I  can't say enough about Tori.  Definately check this song out.
0,my opinion is that the quality of the tracks is uneven, but there is enough really good music to make up for it
0,I'm 19, and ever since I was a little kid, I've loved the music of Elvis Presley! There are some awesome songs on this CD like Don't Be Cruel, Hound Dog, All Shook Up, (Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear, Jailhouse Rock, Stuck On You, Good Luck Charm, Return to Sender, and A Little Less Conversation! If you love classic Elvis music, you'll love ELV1S 30 #1 HITS!!!
0,Still loving my CD years later. Great CD!
0,is amazing! I hope you buy it.  You will not be disapointed in the purchase. Long live heavy metal dude.
0,i have also have bought this now cd to and i like the last review i just did for #9 i really loved it.i thought that this now cd was very good. and i also thought it was very well put together espesally the NO DOUBT song 'it's my life' i thought the song was pretty good.and i also loved the Beyonce song ME,MYSELF,AND I.  i really love that song.so like i just said in my last review people that is collecting this now music series and doesn't have this one should buy it because it is worth the money and wait.chrisfan.
0,Green Street truly features one of the greatest jazz guitarists in a trio setting. With Ben Tucker on bass and Dave Bailey on drums this is one of the few albums that Grant Green ever made that truly shows what an amazing soloist and improvisor he really was. The opening track, No. 1 Green Street, is really a masterful solo by Green. It is so amazing how you can really tell how much Grant is getting in to the music he is making. Those trills. Oh! Man! Those TRILLS! This album is one of the finest jazz guitar trio session ever recorded. This is a must for any one only familiar with Grant Green, Wes Montgomery or any one who just really wants a really awesome guitar album.
0,I grabbed a few copies of this when I was 11 and it's still as dope now as it was then.  Wow, I can't believe that joint dropped 19 years ago.		A lot of people don't seem to understand what made Rakim such a special emcee.  Think about most rap records and singles that came out before this album (before '87).  Most of the joints being released were either basic party raps, showcase joints where emcees were biggin' up their DJ, or break beats for b-boys to get busy to.  Many refer to this as the days of "yes y'allin".  Well, after Paid In Full dropped, all that changed and the days of yes y'allin' were all but over and done with.  Rakim made a lot of rappers go back to the lab and rethink their approach to the game.  Want some examples?  Just to name a few, check out Kool Moe Dee's first album and his Funke Funke Wisdom album.  There's a distinct difference in his flow.  Check out Run DMC.....the rhymes on their self titled debut are way different than the rhymes on the Down With The King LP.  Kurtis Blow all but vanished because his flow wasn't up to par anymore.  Even KRS One (who also debuted in '87 with his group Boogie Down Productions) became more lyrical on BDP's 2nd LP.  There are a lot of things that changed when Rakim "came in the door...." (pun intended).  He was one of the first to raise the bar and for that he will ALWAYS get love from and be respected by the true heads.  If Rakim doesn't step on the scene, who knows, we might still be kickin' party raps to basic drum loops and guitar riffs.  You may have never heard from cats like Nas, Canibus, Chino XL, Eminem, or any other seriously lyrical cats.  He brought the LYRICS to the forefront when it was all about beats and partying.  Now do you see why Rakim is so important?  Sure, a lot of people do it now, so it may not seem like such a groundbreaking step nowadays, but being one of the first is something that you simply cannot take away from Rakim Allah.  There's a reason why he's one of the most frequently quoted (or bitten depending on your view) rappers ever.		Flaws on the album are nill.  Good luck finding any.  The sound is a bit dated, but I wouldn't have it any other way.		Paid In Full is one of those rare landmark hip hop albums.  There aren't very many landmark albums in rap, so that's actually saying a whole lot.  Some will tell you this isn't the best they've ever heard, but it's important to rap/hip hop culture for so many other immeasurable and intangible reasons outside of being the "best you've ever heard".  If this album isn't in your collection, then I question how solid your foundation in this genre is.  Go get it and quit kidding yourself.  This is more than a collector's piece, this album should be a, if not THE, cornerstone in your hip hop collection.  Hell, I have three copies in each format (LP, Cassette, and CD) just to ensure that this album stays with me until I'm gone.  This is one of the albums I'm going to play for my grandkids when they start to get into rap music.  It's THAT good.  I highly recommend this one.

0,Kent is an unbelievable band, if you don't have&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Isola/dp/B00000AFYH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Isola</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Hagnesta-Hill/dp/B00004KH5X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Hagnesta Hill</a>&nbsp;(english versions) then RUN and buy them now. Vapen & Ammunition is unfortunately in Swedish and I seriously doubt we will ever get another english Kent CD, since the rest of the world ignores them. But this takes up where Isola left off, and while Hagnesta is a great album it was a tad too synthy to equal Isola, and even though this is in Swedish i have a feeling this would have equaled Isola. I know this sounds crazy, but that's what happens when us Anglos get addicted to Kent! So in summary - a worthy buy for the Kent fan, even if you don't speak the language. Hey, just think, when that Swedish exchange student comes over to your bachelor pad, you will have the perfect CD to make out to! That's what I'm counting on, anyways.
0,While we await the arrival of Britney Spears' new studio album (set to be released in early December), the music label continues to issue new compilation and remix albums. Fall, 2011 brought "B in the Remix, Vol. 2", and last Fall we were treated to "Playlist: The Very Best of" (14 songs for the price of an EP). Now we get this double album. Just a few months from now will mark the 15th anniversary of Britney's first single, so in a way this compilation can be viewed as a celebration of 15 years of Britney.		"The Essential Britney Spears" (2 CDs, 32 songs; 116 min.) is the most complete overview of the `best' of Britney Spears to date. On CD1, we get all of Britney's singles starting with 1998's "... Baby One More Time" through 2004's "Outrageous". There are just a couple of singles missing: "Born To Make You Happy" (which by all means should've been included), "Don't Let Me Be The Last to Know", and "I Love Rock `n' Roll" (a big hit outside the US). CD2 picks up with 2004's My Prerogative" and runs all the way through this year's "Scream & Shout" (with will.i.am). Given the timing of this compilation, it would've been fabulous if this had included Britney's latest hit "Ooh La La" (from "Smurfs 2"),, but alas. And not to be super-picky but I would've left off the two non-singles that appear on CD2 ("Hot As Ice" and "Out From Under") and instead would've included the missing 3 singles I mentioned earlier.		Couple of comments: from a pure music perspective, of all the "best ofs" out there on Britney, this is the best and most complete, and from here on out the only to have if you are a casual Britney fan (assuming there is such a thing). Furthermore, the songs are brought chronologically, which makes for a much better listening experience (compare this to the hodge-podge sequencing on the 2004 "Greatest Hits" compilation). As for the die-hards, there is no new music on here so no compelling reason to buy this, other than for the pleasure of having this in your CD collection. Last, but certainly not least, this 2CD collection is selling at a very, very fan-friendly price (the price of a single CD basically). So what's not to like? "The Essential Britney Spears" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!		Tracklisting: CD1: 1...Baby One More Time 2. Sometimes 3. You Drive Me Crazy (The Stop Remix) 4. From the Bottom Of My Heart 5. Oops!...I Did It Again 6. Lucky 7. Stronger 8. I'm a Slave 4 U 9. I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman 10. Overprotected (The Dark Child Remix) 11. Boys (The Co-Ed Remix) 12. Me Against The Music 13.

0,This is a really great album that is a clear progression from previous work.  I thought AILD lost some of the melodic aspect on Powerless Rise that made some of their early albums great, but they brought in much more "technicality" to the guitar work.  This album seems to put it all together.  It feels like it has a lot of the melodic/catchyness of Shadows, the power of Ocean Between us, and the technical aspects of Powerless Rise and overall it really works great together.  I'll be listening to this album for a long time, whereas I barely listened to Powerless.
0,There's something in the soil in Oklahoma that produces some great music performers		Oklahoma is not the first place you think of when you think the hotbed of music. But when you realize that  Western Swing legend Bob Wills was based out of Tulsa  (even though he was born in Texas and his band was called "the Texas Playboys"), and both  Leon Russell and J.J. Cale were born there, you realized this Midwestern state shouldn't be overlooked.		Guitarist Steve Ripley formed the Oklahoma-bred super group The Tractors in 1994, and is good friends with Russell and Cale. They had one major Country/Pop hit with "Baby Likes To Rock It".		Now, 15 years later, Ripley has reformed the Tractors for this new album which recaptures much of the energy from that first album. But this is mostly a Ripley project with the guitarist on lead vocals and the composer, or co-writer, of seven of the ten tracks. The disc starts off on high energy with the rocking "Up Jumped the Boogie" (no, not the old Sugarhill Gang hip hop classic, but a new song which Ripley co-wrote with Russell) and keeps up the energy with the Harlan Howard classic "Pick Me Up on Your Way Down". Cale composed - and plays on - "Rhythm Bone" and Russell wrote, and plays, piano, on "Good Old Days". So all the best tracks are grouped up front. The pace only slows on two tracks ("My Blue Heart" and "That's Where It Hurts") but picks up on "Midnight Train" which sounds like a traditional ballad given a blues band treatment (and it works). At over five minutes, it's the longest track on the album.		The instrumental arrangements are creative and varied. Along with Ripley's acoustic guitar there's piano, Hammond B3 organ, accordion, and - on the final track - "It's only Love" - soprano, alto, tenor and bass saxophones (all played by Joe Davis)!		As noted above, not all tracks work - but most of them do - which is why I only gave this album four stars. But, it you want your "Country" music with a "Kick" this CD should make you pretty darn happy.		Steve Ramm	"Anything Phonographic"
0,A suprise when I came across it in the store (missed it's release notes), this album by butch walker again shows his evolution as a singer/songwriter.  Picking up the electrics again, he mixed back into this album some of the great sound of the Marvelous 3 with some of his newer sound from his last album letters, which was a pleasent departure from his prior music.  You have to love the title Bethamphetamine.  In all, a nice flowing album, produced and mixed well, and a great addition to the butch walker collection with his southgang, marvelous 3, and solo projects.  Don't forget about his work as producer of the groups like "injected" and "Bowling for Soup" last two albums, which again showcase his talents.
1,After listening to the songs on the album, and then hearing a song from "The Pointer Sisters" -- Let me take you there -- I decided not to buy it.  I could not listen to Sammy sing the song, the same one I heard the Pointer Sisters sing in Vegas, years ago.  Man, what happen to the old Sammy?
1,Many great artists of the nineteen-sixties and seventies waned in the eighties, but how many released work so awful that their record label sued them because of it? By the time Neil Young's tenure with Geffen Records (to whom he signed in the early eighties) was complete, the record label had sued the singer/songwriter for three million dollars for making music "unrepresentative of himself." Listening to Lucky Thirteen, a compilation that collects highlights (and I use the term loosely) from his Geffen years, one can understand Geffen's frustration and disappointment at enduring consistently baffling creative decisions and sub par output from this usually outstanding artist.	Throughout his time at Geffen, Mr. Young bounced from genre to genre, adopting many sounds completely atypical to his characteristic gruffness and solemnity, often sounding utterly ridiculous. His Geffen debut, 1982's Trans, introduced "Neil 2," a peculiar musical entity who sang sci-fi inspired lyrics into a squeaky computer filter over hyperactive, Kraftwerk-ish synthesizers. Lucky Thirteen's Trans tracks, "Sample and Hold" and "Transformer Man," show Mr. Young's compositional skills still intact (The version of "Transformer Man" from his 1993 Unplugged album shows what a well-written song it truly is) but that is difficult to appreciate through the dense coating of blaring electronic effects. After Trans came 1983's Everybody's Rockin', an outrageously silly album a zoot suit clad Mr. Young recorded with a rockabilly ensemble called the Shocking Pills. Thankfully, Lucky Thirteen spares listeners from any tracks from that monstrosity. Next came 1985's Old Ways, a slow, mummbly country album stuffed with stereotypes of the genre. Just look at the song titles of Lucky Thirteen's Old Ways tracks. "Once an Angel." "Where Is the Highway Tonight?" Ugh. Next came 1986's Landing On Water, an album that bored listenors with its conformity to the lowest common denominator of the current new wave movement. One track, however, "Hippie Dream," smartly included on Lucky Thirteen, rages with intense cynicism and grinding guitars reminiscent of Neil 1. There was hope for more of the same when Mr. Young reunited with his on-again-off-again backing band, Crazy Horse on 1987's Life. Unfortunately dated eighties-style production and an obvious lack of creative energy bogged the album down. Life did feature two stand-out tracks, however, the startling, current-event inspired songs, "Mideast Vacation" and "Around the World," both of which are also high points on Lucky Thirteen. The compilations' final song is not from any of Mr. Young's Geffen releases, but the title track from This Note's for You, an 1988 offering that marked his return to his former label, Reprise. Although, his second tenure at Reprise would see a return-to-form, Mr. Young still had one last experiment to get out of his system. For This Note's for You, he teamed-up with a jazz group called The Bluenotes for an album of lumbering blues-rock. The effort was surprisingly pleasing (Make enough seemingly random creative decisions and eventually one has to work out right). The title track features an excellent bluesy rhythm and lyrics that cleverly mock musicians' product-endorsement deals.	After This Note's for You, Mr. Young released 1989's Freedom, his stunning comeback record and went on to a period of creative prosperity that rivaled his classic output of the seventies. Unfortunately, his eighties work comprises a valley as deep as his peaks of the seventies and nineties are high. Lucky Thirteen stands as a decent crash coarse for fans enticed by work from his better days and curious about this peculiar stage in his career, but expect to be more bewildered and disillusioned than impressed. Lucky Thirteen is a thorough display of a great artist at his most outlandish, confusing and downright bad.
1,This girl is no way near the beauty of aaliyah nor a great enough dancer to janet... i give the girl mad props because the girl can dance but she does not have the presence like janet... ciara's voice is just not that great... she sounds like a carwreck... whereas aaliyah had a smooth delicate voice over hip hop beats and janet sounded sexy & innocent over pop r&b and rock music...		ciara is a 1 hit maybe 2 hit wonder...ciara will not make it through half of next year without people saying "ciara who>?" i think she will make it better as a choreographer than a singer...		'goodies' & '1,2 step' are obviously the best tracks on the album... they are going to get mad play in the clubs and if i hear 'goodies' at the club one more time.... they play that song at the club every 2 min. every single spot i go to...		anyways... if you want the album be of caution this album is not all that great and 2 years from now you will us this cd as a coaster for drinks (lloyd's, houston's, b2k's, and chingy's cd make great coasters.... worth my money)		1.5 stars
1,Never could get on with this album. I thought No Prayer For The Dying was average (a shock for a Maiden fan from the old days) but this one is downright awful. I was moderately hopeful when the single of Be Quick Or Be Dead was released, but this album crushed those hopes. Some of the vocals are okay (Childhood's End) and the title track finally made some kind of sense after seeing it live...but no thanks.
1,Nothing Mesmerizing - Nothing Really New - Same Old Same Old - Seems That New Rock Today Is The Same As Old Rock Of Yesteryear
1,hmmm, my first time listening to any of this bands records, never really believed the hype and reviews were always mixed for them.  Well after a few listens I can say this is one of the worst CD's I've heard all year.  At 8 songs with a few of them being barely even songs you feel short changed even though it's a tad over 40-minutes long.  I'm not a big death core fan and this kind of reminds me of the direction The Crown and The Haunted went with their music after a couple of albums.  There are a few good songs on this record, but in a world where a dozen records are released each week this album just gets lost in the pile of mediocre metal bands.  At least this only cost me like $4 for the DVD digipak from Century Media.
1,YEAH,  I BOUGHT THIS AND TOOK IT BACK, THE SOUND IS HORRIBLE, MUFFLED, JUST TERRIBLE.  I LOVE THEM SO MUCH AND WAS SO DISAPPOINTED.  THEIR FIRST CONCERT IS SO AWESOME, PERFECT.  DOES ANYONE KNOW WHY THE SOUND WAS SO BAD IN THIS ONE, AND IF ITS  IN EVERY DVD OR WHAT?
1,After I came to this page, I had to pour myself some coffee, throw cold water on my face, and slap myself a bit because I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  As of this writing, the vast majority of the reviews here give teen actress / wannabe pop star Lindsay Lohan's latest album 5 stars - the highest possible review.  Hmmmm... apparently the promotions department at Casablanca Records is working feverishly to develop interest in this album.  Now, in my honest and fair opinion, 5 star reviews should be reserved for something that is an absolute masterpiece - a true work for the ages.  Can anyone who listened to this album honestly say that this belongs in the class of works by, say, Mozart or Beethoven, or perhaps Wilco or Radiohead?  But I digress...		On to the matter at hand, which is Lindsay Lohan's second album, A Little More Personal (Raw).  We are introduced with "Confessions Of A Broken Heart (Daughter To Father)", a track which may be semi-autobiographical to Lohan (who co-wrote four songs on this album), but is an off-putting, cliched, treacly mess of a song.  Lohan sings with such ham-fisted conviction that you honestly get this vibe from her that she thinks that she is the only person to ever have a dysfunctional family, to ever have his/her parents divorce, to ever become distant from his/her father.  And in light of who she really is (drinking, dancing on tables and partying until the wee hours with the Hollywood elite), you know the song is not genuine and she's just milking this situation as fodder for album sales.  And the lyrics themselves are pretty sorry - she sings about wanting "a daddy to hold [her]" as if she's about 8, and the way she wails lines like "Did you ever love me?" shows just how untrained and unpolished her voice is.  Lindsay, cheer up honey - you've lived a charmed life, which both of your parents have made numerous sacrifices to give to you ... besides, there's an exclusive party going on till dawn somewhere on the Sunset Strip and you're invited, that ought to cheer you up.		With this whole album, one kind of gets the feeling that Lohan is just trying to tap into the girl-next-door charm that helped make Kelly Clarkson a ubiquitous star this past year (those marketing geniuses at Casablanca are at it again!).  This commercial makeover is very calculated, given the fact that just a year ago Lohan was whining about being hounded by the paparazzi over lightweight bubblegum dance/pop and seductively cooing double entendres like "I wanna come first".  One can also surmise that Lohan put very little effort into this recording (chalk it up to either those kiddie flicks that really put the champagne and caviar on the table, or to the obvious - lack of talent) - as stated before, she has only four co-write credits on the album, as the bulk of the songwriting goes to studio songsmiths for hire like Kara DioGuardi.  The sound is rather generic as well, with producer John Shanks applying his usual glossy sheen to cover up any inadequacies on the part of the singer or musicians (hey, this guy produces Ashlee Simpson as well!).		Lyrically, at times Lohan tries to sound, as she would say "like, deep or something" on certain tracks, but often finds herself stumbling on some pretty awkward, clumsy lyrics - for instance, she sings about a "universe of missing stuff" on "Black Hole", and the words on tracks like "A Beautiful Life" are unbelievably cliched and irrelevant.  Then there's a song like "Fastlane", where Lohan tries to pass herself off as a world-weary, inhibited, troubled soul, which is only so convincing when the opposite is true.  In the hands of a more capable artist (and with some revised lyrics), this song could have worked - in Lohan's hands, it just falls apart.		In summary: A Little More Personal (Raw) is just the typical weak disposible mass-market fare that usually sees release this time of the year.  There's an attempt at reinvention here, but it just doesn't pan out.  Lindsay Lohan's first album was pure drivel, but at least it was a style that suited her fine - here, she just seems like a fish out of water.  She makes an attempt at relevance but only comes out looking slightly more credible than Ashlee Simpson, and that's not saying much.  Instead, I would recommend looking not to the major music video outlets, but to the left of the radio dial for inspiration - you're far more likely to find something with more substance and with a much longer shelf-life there than on this tepid, vacuous commercial pop/rock album.  My advice: you can do far better than this.
1,Paul Weller has released many terrific discs in his solo career. This is not one of them.  Both of his last two albums, Wake Up the Nation and 22 Dreams were hit and miss affairs with more hits than misses. Prior to that the only other inconsistent recording he released was Heliocentric but that too had some wonderful tunes. This one is a mess, it is slick, overproduced, overly busy and is the weakest batch of songs he has written since Style Council. Way more misses than hits here. You have to give Weller credit in that he is constantly looking for a new direction but on this he just got lost.
1,The songs are good, don't get me wrong, but the fast beat songs... sound like the other fast beat songs... and the slow songs sound like the other slow songs. I wish there was a more unique tune to this cd, I think the techno-ish style is cool, but not when every song is like that.	Good try Darren Hayes, but keep trying
1,I must agree and add my $0.02. It is VERY OBVIOUS to me that this is too loud on the mastering job.		If I could send it back, I would - they screwed this up. People spending this much money should have the real deal		Here's a CRAZY IDEA - with a zillion discs in these 'deluxe' editions, WHY NOT HAVE THE MAIN ALBUM PRESENTED WITH PROPERLY NORMALIZED AUDIO AND ANOTHER WITH THE LOUD VERSION - People might actually learn the difference.		PS: In general, you're better with a properly mastered CD and turning up the volume yourself
1,This is a good cd. The only fault I have with it is that it was recorded poorly. But otherwise it was just as promised. I highly recommend it for any Rainbow fan or Dio either one! Steve Shepherd-A-Rock n Roll Nut!
1,Beyonce is trying to be like Kelis in this song, but it's not working. "Ring the Alarm" is a complete mess. For real, if you're 25 years old you should be able to express your anger in a creative way that won't hurt people's ears! Beyonce isn't a good songwriter either. Skip this at all costs.
1,get a life. my radio sounds better than aaron carter.... my radio is broken!!!!!!!!!!	my favorite part of the album is when it's over!	he thinks he's rapping!	get a life
1,I can't  believe this is the same band that recorded THE STRANGE CASE OF... Just have a few songs  that are outstanding and the rest is filler. The best of album is Lzzy Hale and the worst are the songs. A big big ...BIG DISSAPOINTMENT.
1,I'll start off first by saying that I have all the Cure albums, and have been a fan for a long time.  I have enjoyed the many phases of the Cure, in fact I have celebrated them all.  With that said, I firmly believe that Disintegration represents the pinnacle of Robert's artistic vision.  The wistful, blissful atmosphere of that release continues to haunt to this day, the layers of sound making for deep listening and reflection.  So, if Disintegration is the murky swamp, their latest release is merely a mud puddle.  The music isn't particularly inspiring, and Robert is in one of his "F--- you all" moods, which you'd think he would have grown up and out of by now.  Robert has always had a subtle sense of melody, but I find that it's disturbingly lacking here.  And for the most part he's just yelling out loud and not singing so much, which grates on my ears after a while.  I don't really see much new ground being broken, which would be the perfect answer to all the copycat groups which have sprung up.  Instead, it's mostly turning over the same ground that he first dug up two decades ago.  Save your money.
1,thank god for good songs like "hole in my soul" and "jaded" because these old cds are really boring. its not aerosmiths true roots		for good aerosmith listen to hokin on the hobo
1,I listened to this as soon as I got it. I am a huge Cosby fan, but this is a much weaker CD than Wonderfulness, Revenge, and To My Brother Russell... It is still worth having for the completist though. There are better albums out there not in print anymore; "My Father Confused Me..." for instance.
1,Once again some idiot engineers decided to "improve" the old mixes by compressing the life right out of them. This modernization process ruins the music. Wake up it's 2014 we don't need top make the old mixes sound like in your face 1999 death metal.
1,Brand Here Now	The older pop gets, the more constrained to age groups its appeal becomes. Young people have own youth cultures just like we had (and still do) had ours. Perhaps this explains why you'd have to put me in a straitjacket and tie to a chair t o m ake me listen to Be Here Now again. For me it is unfathomable how a record as substanceless as Be Here Now can have such a broad appeal. I thought Definitely Maybe had some punky appeal and real attitiude but the bigger Oasis became, the hollower the i r mu sic sounded. Be Here Now is the sound of a band that could do what they wanted - Carte Blanche - and what do they choose to do? They become 1967-era Beatles Mk. II. Paul McCartney once said how sad he was about all these bands trying so hard to sound like the Beatles. Surely the point is to try and accomplish something new and exciting (like Beck, Tortoise, Labradford and Jim O'Rourke). The songwriting-by-numbers approach of Noel Gallagher sometimes comes up trumps, but how a whole generation can embrace this as one of the best albums of all time is indicative of one of two things: either standards have fallen woefully low or the music industry has managed to turn pop into a global brand-oriented commodity. And by the way, if you think I'm the only one who thinks Be Here Now is poor, think again. Noel Gallagher himself in an interview disowns Morning Glory, Be Here Now and Standing on the Shoulders of Giants. Fact.
1,I love Natasha Bedingfield but hate her album "Strip Me."  It is mixed so loud as to be unlistenable.  I wish she'd put out acoustic versions of these songs.
1,"Why do we fall?"  We fall because we have film music that is boring, tedious and without much discernible memorable melody and enjoyment. What Zimmer gives us with this score is lots of "DUU DUU dah dah...DUU DUU dah dah...DUU DUU dah dah...DUU DUU dah dah..." with the blare of horn and orchestral noises, that might work in padding the film with orchestral 'something', but not a satisfying, memorable soundtrack to enjoy isolated from the film. Am I comparing this music to Danny Elfman's score?  Darn tootin, because that's a prime example of how you write music for a comic book super-hero: bright, dynamic, thematic and memorable. You don't get any of that in this soundtrack, but you do get plenty of noise, labeled with clever Latin bat names (ohhh, so ingenious and pretentious)
1,This album sets JANET JACKSON or should I say DAMITA JO back to her Fame days. What a waste of MONEY I put this cd (...). Now I know why  she had to come up with something to get this to move  off the shelves. IF you like a lot of softed voiced mumble jumble and maybe ONE dance song --Here it is. IF you want music that you can sing or dance to-- Move on. I heard Janet say this is a album about being in love well, I find it more LUST than LOVE. Janet keep this love cd behind closed doors and do what you do best DANCE MUSIC.
1,There are only two of them on this album --- Number of the Beast and Run to the Hills. I was going to impose an additional star penalty for the pain caused by missed opportunities, lack of rehearsal time, and just plain lazy sloppiness ---- but I'm generous. The difference between the filler and the good tunes is so distinct that a serious listener would swear it's two different bands. One that has learned to play a solid fully developed tune - together in tempo - and one that can't keep simple 4/4 rock timing. I was actually quite surprised at the disparity in quality on this album as well as the lost potental of several poorly executed tracks and others that are just plain filler. I recommend downloading single tracks when it comes to Iron Maiden --- some of their tracks are outright classics.
1,It really does I had heard 3 songs by them so I bought the album, I have so much to learn. Those were the only good songs on the whole albu, and I don't even like those anymore this sucked so bad. how can ou call this punk rock. A little band I know called Sum 41 is punk rock, listen to them, not this.
1,not her best
1,Give me a break! If anybody who already owns 'are you experienced' and 'electric ladyland' buys this album, you can call that person a freak of nature. If you are looking to buy a one single CD Hendrix compilation, ANY other compilation out there is better (there are at least two in the market these days).Why don't they re-release something like 'Live at Monterey' instead of another compilation? Who do they expect to buy this?
1,It's sad that most Elvis fans don't know that Elvis was a racist. Ask public enemy, I don't like his music.
1,What the heck? Is this the new TPAIN album? this is a terrible kanye west album man im so disappointed the auto tune thing is terrible im sick of rappers doin this crap man this is the biggest diappointment of the year kanye you sunk to the low level bro
1,A beautifull girl like the sunshine , Martika scored a well-deserved top 5 hit back in the late 80's with " Toy Soldier " , an elegant pop song which hasn't lost any of it's charm with the pass of time . A  best of though with selected tracks from her ( only ) two albums is available for the buyer more as a memory of a era now remembered with nostalgia than as an essential music proposition . Undersold cd-single " Martika's Kitchen " and especially the deep , ethereal love-song of " Love..thy will be done " also worth revisiting but still are not enough to support the release of sixteen-track collection .
1,What a big disappointment this is. The band just ran out of ideas for good music and should have disbanded rather than put out this junk. Their first two albums are great, their 3rd one not bad, but after that they are all very poor.
1,Yup, you guessed it. It sucks! More mediocrity from pop rapping sensation Lil Wayne. Auto-tuned filth, and far too many guest appearances from other rappers. Well some of them are rappers, some are pop rap abominations, such as Drake and T- Pain. This is merely proof that Lil Wayne can't carry an album on his own because well, he sucks. Just listen to the guy talk during interviews, or better yet, go watch a bit of some of his ustream shows that are floating around online. The guy is practically brain-dead, and it really shows in his "music". This is rap for posers and kids. I've literally seen little elementary and 6th grade kids jam to this nonsense thinking they're badass. Ugh. Stay far away from this abomination. Hip Hop and Rap is dying, and Lil Wayne is a major contributor. If you must listen to this, all I ask is that you admit it's crap. Listen away, but do not proclaim that Lil Wayne is the greatest rapper alive, because he isn't.
1,This is the 2nd CD I've gotten from Amazon that skips terribly. The first one skipped, I returned it and Amazon replace it with another one that skips. I am getting my money back this time and I won't be ordering any more CD's from Amazon.
1,Oakenfold was good.  If you do, then skip this one.  My impressions of this cd are that Mr. Oakenfold is chasing after the cheese that made everyone love Fat Boy Slim for a few minutes.  Problem is, we've moved on, and so should Oakey.  There's not depth here folks.  What there is a lot of though, is guitars, and not in a good way.  Check out his other recent mix albums instead, where he actually mixes.
1,I know I'm in the minority but, really, outside of 3-4 songs, this is prototypical, bland Christian music.  You can put all of these songs on any typical Christian radio station and you wouldn't know them from anyone else.  I'm not sure what everyone else is hearing...I know a lot of you are getting excited about hearing different instruments but Rend did it first and does it better.  I never understand why majority of Christian artists all sound the same and have "that" sound (you know what I mean)...you literally can listen to music and tell which are Christian artists.		Even my wife, who's much more pop-minded than me, says the first song is good but rest of album is meh.  she say's they're trying to be Rend.  My kids found several toe tapping, head nodding but lost interest in most of the album.		If you want great music (with great lyrics) and stuff that others aren't listening, go look up: Branches, Pacific Gold/Wayfarer, Liz Vice, The Followers, Elizabeth Cook (Gospel Plow), Evan Thomas Way, The Listening		Bands that are Christians but not singing this type of lyrics:  The Great Book of John, Future of Forestry, Jeremy Enigk		Trust me, you'll be thanking me later when you listen to the other referrals and leave this group be.  I Am They are like all the rest
1,rap sucks and so does jay-z.  i'm glad he retired and all the other rappers need to retire too.
1,got it for the song me,myself and I it's the best song on it
1,Good book.	Good singers.	Bad show.	Read the book.
1,I really didn't care for the cd, its overproduced the vocals sound like they're being sung through a voice-box, and they're not focused nor powerful unfortunately. The speedier tracks seem to lack control and have none of the power of equally speedy punk or thrash. Its like they're trying to outrun themselves.	 The tracks themselves try to sound upbeat, but underneath it all I found the music somewhat despressing despite the uptempo.	 I've been suggested some of the Reverend Horton Heats newer more mellow stuff so I will check that out before I write the band off entirely.
1,I understand what happened with the guys from Judas, my once beloved band...	Realizing they were not capable anymore of writing great classic metal stuff, realizing they had not Halford in their ranks anymore, realizing the actual metal scenario were totally different, they sensed they needed a drastic change, they needed to start from scratch to make any lasting impact with the new singer line-up.	Ut till now, alright. But to start from a scratch using a new name for the band would mean to lose two decades of hard working to establish the Judas Priest name. SO, they did more or less like Tony Iommi did with Sabbath: they continued to use the traditional name of the band, altough it's NOT THE SAME BAND!!!	So, JUGULATOR is kind of dissapointing because it carries the Judas Priest flag, when it's clearly some sort of Glenn Tipton's solo project. THe lyrics are beyond junk, they are horrible. The heaviness is exxagerated, no subtleness, no great licks, just brutal aggression. They are copying here, not showing the guys how to do it. THat's what made me sad about this "comeback".	As for RIpper, nothing to say. I saw him singing live. THe guy has monster lungs, he's a really gifted singer. ONly the songs they are giving him to sing are not good enough.
1,rapper don;t get it. dvds or a money making project. not just a way to be seen.
1,This cd is really lousy, the 4 good songs on the album are the classics Smells like teen spirit, in bloom, come as you are, & lithium. this is overrated and lousy.
1,I haven't bought this, nor should you. The members of the Dead Kennedys (not including Jello) are simply too lazy to go out and get a job. And they are jealous that Jello has had a successful career after the breakup of the band. DON'T BUY ANY DEAD KENNEDYS CD'S UNLESS THEY ARE FROM ALTERNATIVE TENTACLES.
1,Bland, boring, generic second-rate Dream Theater clones exhibit all the bombast and little of the songwriting intellect only a few bands of the prog-metal genre posses.
1,Okay. I see three Black men on the front of a CD and the CD is titled "Monkey Business." Talk about buffoonery. I couldn't get into this because I'm not really into mainstream watered-down hip-hop. I don't care if these guys are popular right now and have 3 number one hits. I don't like what the whole MTV crowd likes or considers music. The Black Eyed Peas act like they're doing something hip and innovative on this CD, but the sampling is out of control and there's absolutely nothing new being brought to the table. Everything sounds the same and Fergie can't sing or dance. The only thing Fergie can do is pose and act cute when she's actually not. Her only reason for being in the group is to make it more appealing to the mainstream masses. "Monkey Business" is wack to the max and is something soccer moms would jam too because they want to be "cool moms". Skip this at all costs.
1,No opinion.
1,NIRVANA are amongst one of the most overrated groups of all time after Green Day. They only made one decent song in Smells like teen spirit. Their other albums and songs are pure drivel and junk. DONT BUY THIS TERRIBLE ALBUM.Get TEN from PEARL JAM instead.
1,juve wasn't so great when he departed the williams now was he he tried to go solo but now he's back on cash money making more trashy records about cars, money and how many girls he's gonna penetrate yeah welcome back juve holla bg might come back next turk's incarcerated right now.
1,Listening to this CD will give nothing more than a good idea of what is wrong with most rap music today. It is nothing but ignorant rhymes and annoying beats. If you already have this CD, I have found that it makes a good doorstop.
1,This so-called grunge album and this band are the reason why this music business has been garbage for nearly 15 years, I Knew this album destroyed rock and roll, smells like teen spirit is the most overrated song ever made and the only good song out of whole album is about a girl, And kurt has zero talent and a hypocrite, he claims he's so hardcore and anti-mainstream, if he was that, then why did he sold out to MTV, Why did he bring grunge into music, why did he go on MTV in the first place?		This band is such a fake, thank god that dave grohl the only one with real talent that could play drums.		This album and this album paved the way for bad alternative rock, pop punk, emo and especially the most horrendous rock genre ever and the worst one I've ever listen to(Nu Metal) and ruined a great band (Metallica)		This has got to be the most overrated and medicore album ever, If you want a real essential album from the 1990's look no further than alice in chains dirt.		Nevermind was the beginning of the downfall of music in america.		Thanks a lot kurt for ruining U.S. Music.
1,Disappointing.
1,don't be crazy and buy this at $57!  you can buy this brand new directly from Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs (the people who remastered this disc) for $29.99
1,Unfortunately, there's no sweet emotion when it comes to this new material from the boys of Boston? Bottomline, Aerosmith is one of my favorite classic rocking bands of all time, but this is very disappointing release INMOP! Other than "Street Jesus", just can't find a great grooving track to get into/odd sounding? Also, more ridiculous, boring ballads! WHY? Anyhow, Music From Another Dimension is just out there alright and goes nowhere INMOP.
1,Every song sounds the same and she doesn't sound very good at all.  Production is bland, repetitive.  Really disappointed.  Nothing at all like her first two albums.
1,Former Club Nouveau frontwoman Valerie Watson dropped this album this year and it is one of the strangest albums ever (although Val herself always acted a little peculiar). She seems to be on some kind of "funk" vibe, which is fine but the production is too underwhelming and she tries too hard to be funky on songs like 'Pass the Vibe', 'Do What Come Funky', 'The Real (Do-Do)' (featuring Bootsy Collins) and 'Soul Shack'. Speaking of underwhelming production, even the Jane Eugene (of Loose Ends) guest spot on 'Whether U Know It' doesn't save the song from its dreariness. Val can sing and if she would just focus on that instead of trying to be funky, the results can be lovely like the song, 'Days Like This'. I can't recommend this album to anyone. Just check out Club Nouveau's old stuff if you like Val Watson.
1,I am a life-long (and a long life at that) avid Johnny Cash fan. If he were alive today his mission would be to locate all copies of this CD and make sure that they're destroyed. Do a service to the Man In Black and do not purchase it.
1,OK, I'll say it first. This cd stinks.  Pilson's voice is a disaster and none of their original songs are memorable. These guys say they aren't Dokken and constantly try to disassociate themselves from their old band,  yet they put retreads of some of Don's greatest songs on this cd just to have something halfway decent on this mess of tunes.	George has done NOTHING good since leaving the band, or was it more like being booted from the band?!  The songs are boring, long and some are rip offs from Dokken. More originality is needed, therefore this gets 1 star rating.
1,I am a Stephen Stills fan and I heartily vote for the first Manassas record and their	Musikladen video (check that out--it is very cool), but if you are thinking	of getting this, please note it sounds like 31 minutes (correct--that's it)	of out-takes, and the songs are mostly forgettable.  But the defining feature	of this record is that it scarcely has a groove.	It isn't that the tunes were conceived as grooveless	(they sound promising), but that they are played in a loose, noodle-headed way.	It is one of those 1970s records with a bunch of musicians playing reasonable bits individually,	but (unlike the first disc) the various parts seldom sit in a groove;	the drums are low in the mix and the result feels like	a 3D movie without 3D specs.  I blame poorly conceived	multi-tracking (drugs?), and, especially: not enough rehearsal.	This record does not sound "live" (i.e., together) or in focus.	(The mix--and several songs--on the _actual_ out-takes record,"Pieces,"	are better than this one; if you are buying mp3s,	put together your own selection based on this set and that one.)	  My rec.: select just a few items from "Down the Road."
1,Let me preface this by saying that I am not a Ricki Lee Jones fan. My husband, however, likes her music and has  all of her cd's. .As we listened to this cd for the first time, I asked "Who IS this? It's awful." My husband made me guess and soon I heard her familiar tones.  Even he, a solid fan, was somewhat displeased by her indistinguishable(to me) covers of several popular songs.  Ricki, this is not good!  This is for my husband's  listening only! Or maybe he won't listen to it either.
1,This album is just sad. Sugar ray have always been a guilty pleasure of mine and i'v had no problem admitting I liked them...until now. This album is a big joke piriod. It lacks the maturity of the self titeld and the catchy pop rock of 14:59. Sugar ray tryed to sell out and make bubbelgum pop with this release and faid misurably.
1,I've been a Metallica fan since a friend introduced me to Master of Puppets in 1986. My favorite albums are still the earliest ones, but I still enjoyed the "Black Album" and even Load and Re-Load had some gems. However, I couldn't stomach St. Anger.		On the whole, I would say Death Magnetic sounds a lot more like a cross between the "Black Album" and Load/Re-Load. For whatever reason, I just can't get into it. It's certainly a metal album, but not one that seems to be catching my interest. My love affair with Metallica has been a long one...22 years is a pretty good run...but I fear we've simply grown apart.		Maybe it's not you, Metallica, maybe it's me.
1,I am a huge fan of Y&T and Dave Meniketti but this album was quite a disappointment to me. Nothing on it is really bad, but by the same token, nothing on it is really good either. It is mostly just kinda boring. Dave plays well as always and his voice still seems ageless, but the song are completely unexceptional. Nothing to grab your attention. I really wish Y&T would just reform and go back and listen to all the great stuff they did back in the 80s and early 90s. Just do more of the same. For classic Meniketti get the Y&T albums Black Tiger, Meanstreak, In Rock We Trust, Down For The Count, Contagious, and Ten.
1,I first heard Jackson preview the song "Lawyers in Love" at a concert in Belgium in 1982. A few months later in 1983, the album was released and boy, to say I was disappointed would be an understatement. For me, the lowest point in JB's career up until then.  When you compare it with "Late For The Sky", you have to wonder if this was the same guy.  In "For A Dancer", from LFTS, JB sings "I don't know what happens when people die, can't seem to grasp it as hard as I try".  From this album, "For A Rocker", he declares, "I've got a shirt so unbelievably bright".  JB's foray here into synthesizers and other electronic stuff (at times sounding Abba-ish, like parts of "Cut It Away") just left me declaring, whaaaaat?  And in "Tender Is The Night", lyrics like "tender is the night/when you hold your baby tight" made me cringe. "Say It Isn't True" is just plain turgid. I know that in the 70's, Phoebe Snow declared JB's lyrics could make her cry. I figured she might have the same reaction with this album but for a totally different reason.		A Rolling Stone article of the time lamented JB's new direction, summed up with "now he's wearing tacky green shoes and singing throw-away pop songs. Talk about running on empty" ... perhaps that says it best.
1,This, the worst lyric of all time, is so excruciatingly stupid and annoying as to render the entire album worthless and unbearable. "Human" is wimpy and catchy enough musically to get stuck in the brain. Before you can stop it, you may find yourself asking this painfully goofy, nonsensical question over and over in your mind.		Recommendation: avoid at all costs!
1,San Francisco is the only good recording on this CD.  I would not buy it again
1,I was excited about this release and when I preordered it the description was "Sugar Mountain-Live At Canterbury House 1968 (CD/DVD)". I see that Amazon has since added a "-A" to the DVD part of the description. Based on the fact that other recent Neil Young CDs have contained DVDs with something to watch, I fully expected to see a concert video when I popped the DVD in the player last night. No such luck. There is a still picture of Neil for the concert and a 5 minute advertisement for the upcoming Archives release. What a let down.		I thought the music CD was pretty good and at least all of the between songs chatter is set up as individual tracks so it can be skipped easily. But what I really wanted was to watch this concert. I don't think that was an unreasonable expectation given that the item was sold to me as "Sugar Mountain-Live At Canterbury House 1968 (CD/DVD)".		When selling a DVD that is not a DVD in the sense that most people think of, the fact that there is nothing to watch should be more than clearly stated. Neil loses credibility for deceptive marketing.
1,I bought this CD on the recommendation of a staff music writer of the magazine" The Absolute Sound". He claimed this CD is the best work from Bowie in 10 years.  So much for listening to a 28 year old magazine hack who was probably too young to recall  Bowie's  "Golden Years"  The sound of the CD is in your face most of the time with noisy, loud passages. Unfortunately, DB's voice is less musical and melodic, and on some tracks, it sounds tired.  The CD according to the above mentioned writer confirmed Bowie's return to rock and roll.  Well, that might be so in some ways, BUT in my humble opinion, the music begs for compliments;  the compositions are less harmonic and dramatic than what he wrote as part of Ziggy Stardust and the the Spiders.  Often, I could not wait until a track was over, hoping the next one would redeem its predecessor, if not the entire CD.  It was more an aural assault than music.		I always considered DB a musical genius. I have a 2 discs best hits CD, and of the 20 or so tracks, there is only about two that should be trashed.  The songs: "China Girl,  Modern Love, Panic in Detroit, Ashes to Ashes, Cat People",.....and almost every cut on the Ziggy Stardust CD are enjoyable, clever in presentation, relying on melody, not bombastic background  washes.  To Bowie and company's credit, there are some interesting  jazz elements that are weaved through the later tracks, but they are often too short and the harmonic changes are crudely done. There is little finesse in these segues.		I gave the CD a second listen last night, and grudgingly liked a few of the tracks better.  In my opinion, I think "The Next Day"  is a disappointment, and a blurry reflection of contemporary popular music values and culture		The music of David Bowie in the late 70's and most of the 80's  has often been tagged glam rock, shallow,  overly simplistic .....however, the melodies and  harmonic structure of its tunes evoked deep emotions touched up with swagger and panache.  It may have been the last gasp of an era  of counter-culture and its highly innovative music.
1,Oh man this album is a generic and poorly constructed cash grab. I'm going to go back to "Blood & Values" by Eldest 11 now....the best modern hard rock/alternative metal album of the year.
1,Oh boy!  Memphis was supposed to be the real, that was coming from Jay's mouth years ago, before the truth was leaked. When we actually heard him and the majority of us were unimpressed.  Originally, Sauce Money was going to be the next Jay, and actually had the potential.  But we know Jay makes some questionable moves. I don't even try and figure this sh*t out.  This album is Memphis's second. Apparently the first time around, nobody cared.  I will give Jay credit, he doesn't simply drop an artist when they don't do well.  For whatever reason, he believes in this man and is sticking behind him. I can say as a life long lover oh Hip-Hop. This album did not a damn thing for me.  Memphis isn't wack, but he is just not up to par, or even close.  He reminds me of a cheap Jay Z knock off. Somewhat like Carl Thomas reminds me of a cheap Brian McKnight knockoff.  Boring, uninspired rhymes, stupid hooks.  Production that makes my head hurt.  It's pretty funny when I think how Memphis is talkin about being the man, and being rich. When his "boss" is laughing while he counts the ends he got pimping him.	My suggestion, Sign Kane Jay.  He is the reason you're an emcee, HE put your Burrow on the map.  And he is the originator of all that stuff you talk about today, only he was doing it well over a decade ago.	Album Highlights:  the silence between the tracks, and when it was over.
1,Absolutely terrible!  Just could not find anything that made me want to continue listening to this garbage.
1,Frank Ocean is the member of the vastly popular Odd Future group, a rap ensemble hyped as the next big thing for the music industry. When you reach a level of publicity that reaches that high, there's bound to be disappointment awaiting in the dark waters below. Channel ocean is one of those letdowns. This comes as no surprise, as previous releases from TOF have been touted as "classic" and "groundbreaking" by the press, yet there is nothing about TOF that makes them different from anybody else. Channel orange is said to be "the biggest thing to happen to r&b", when it's just more of the same sounds, ideas, and formulas. Sappy ballads, predictable lyrics; the most damning thing about Channel orange is that it's unbelievably boring. People say this as an extract of hyperbole, but I literally started to fall asleep halfway through the album. There's nothing groundbreaking about this album, nothing that sets it apart from the crowd. It is merely another cog in the hype machine using overenthusiastic praise from the press as fuel to disguise a formulaic product like this as something amazing and unique. It isn't.
1,They sucked back years ago what I did I expect now? First of	all, it's already known that rap sucks. These oreo's only make	matters worse. These guys should have been out of the picture	years ago.
1,Myles,		Are you still obsessed with the car from the ZZ Top videos?		Please advise.		-J
1,Seeing as how I'm from Virginia as well, I had to check out this album, but I heavily dissapointed.  The beats are out of line, and the beats at times sound the same.  I like grindin and virginia, but I hate songs like young boy(A big clarnet or trumpet playin all loudly)and Cot damn(A really anoyin song).  And Pharell just gets annoying, cuz he almost in every single song with his annoyin voice.  Well This is not the album to get, alongside Ja Rule and Jay-Z.  U wanna git a good album git Tupac's better dayz, Nas' God's son, or Scarface's the Fix.  Later for this.
1,If this is a Christmas CD then there is ice water in Hades.  Reba's first Christmas CD "Merry Christmas to You" was a good CHristmas CD.  This travesty called "Secret of GIving" should have remained a secret and to call it a Christmas CD is ridiculous.  There are NO CHRISTMAS sounds on this CD at all...its just more ugly pop from Reba.  She even ruins the beautiful "Mary Did you Know".  Skip this one folks....its really terrible!!!
1,The Mamas and The Papas were nothing more than a blip on the radar screen of rock n roll history. They had a few decent hits.	Some communties sentence you to listen to this set in its entirety as community service punishment. I defy any of you to name 10 Mamas And The Papas songs off the top of your head that were NOT hits.	OK GO! I knew it, you can't do it. The best of CD's are more than enough.
1,"Hell Yeah" is a catchy Club track but like alot of Ginuwine's track record,it's standard soft easy going material. His vocals are what hurt Him more than anything because He just can't bring them up at all. Vocally He is a Whisper Below Usher&that's not saying a whole heck of alot.some catchy moments here&there but nothing special at all.
1,I bought this after i heard the band, Frost. The keyboardist is from IQ and wrote everything on the Frost cd. IQ is a really good band, but I get the feeling the vocalist is phony and loves the sound of his own voice. Sorry, this just didn't do it for me
1,Not since Norah Jones has someone been so overrated, and as the previous commentator said it better than I, mind bogglingly pretentious.  And at least Norah Jones was pleasant, in a kind of young sort of sesame street kiddie appeal, and Jones is cute and has a sort of harmonious prettiness.  Stone however already seems to have a Joplin sort of mannish hideousness and middle aged spread going for her.  To paraphrase Cracker: the world needs another overrated tired white girl pretending to be black and around the block a few times a la Aretha Franklin, like I need a whole in my head!		Go away Joss Stone-at least just torture your own country men and women!
1,If you're in to Pink Floyd's instrumentals and Yes's jam sessions then this album is for you and it's probably a three or three and a half star album for you, but most of this is just noodling around and really doesn't get going.  "Lady Fantasy" is a a powerful epic and is worth owning.  The Snow Goose selections are nothing but 20+ minutes of rather dull instrumentals.  "Song Within a Song," "First Light" and "Rain Dances" are all pleasant enough, but you won't be humming any of these songs when it's over.  Once every couple years is often enough to hear those four songs.  I'd say go out a nd get some Tangerine Dream albums before you plunk down money for this.
1,Aaa... this album is terrible! I've bought this by my friends recommendation and looking at the cover i was like man this must be  an horrible cd! Was i right ? Yes!  I wish i could say other wise but bloodbath is one terrible band and yes all the songs sound the same!! What a shame and the lirycs ? Ha  what a joke... Don't waste your money on this crap insted buy carnel forge those guys are incredible!
1,Chey, should have given the money to the Salvation Army !
1,I made the mistake of foolishly getting this EP promtly upon release because I am such a big fan of MMJ, and Mr. Yames.  To my horror, I found it absolutely unlistenable!  I do not hear what these other people seem to be hearing.  I do not understand the great reviews in cetain magazines.  Yes, I would use the word indulgent to describe a performer who must think he can do no wrong, and dredges up an old thing he did in his bedroom the day George died.  I know, it's supposed to be improved from that original start, but I don't hear that, either.  I hear dreadful, somber, thin versions of George's songs that surely would make the original artist turn over in his grave.  Have I made it clear that I don't like this and feel ripped off, betrayed even?  Save your money for something you can listen to all the way through, at least once.
1,ANY compilation that goes under the uber-boring and generic title "Greatest Hits" better, at the very least, live up to the name, no excuses.  This compilation, although including many of their hits, is missing "All That Glitters Isn't Gold," which hit #49 and thus, technically, one of their greatest hits.  Any comp album with a misleading title is an insult and a failure.  Please, go out and get these songs by buying the three fantastic albums they came from and show this awesome group of women some true respect.
1,If you would ever want to defend&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Rolling-Stone/dp/0679737294/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Rolling Stone</a>, their 1992 review of "Bat Out Of Hell" should be your start. the tenth biggest-selling album in my home city of Melbourne during the 1970s, "Bat Out Of Hell" has caused me no end of irritation ever since I first heard it on the radio when Australian radio in the ealy to middle 1990s was fixated with "classic rock" from long before I was born.		David Keenan, a brilliant and extremely eccentric critic from the Scottish magazine-with-an Australian-namesake "The Sunday Herald", listed "Bat Out Of Hell" as one of the "Best Albums Ever...Honest" in 2003, saying "here his [Todd Rundgren's] restless logic works just fine, supported by a metallic backbone that keeps things driving throughout the most convoluted of arrangements". Although I have nothing but respect for Keenan, especially his appreciation of such touching masterworks as&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Kate-Bush-s-Hounds-of-Love/dp/B00004R7TP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Kate Bush's Hounds of Love</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Fairport-Convention-s-Liege-Lief/dp/B000002GFT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fairport Convention's Liege & Lief</a>, I cannot agree with him here.		Like the worst of 1970s glam-rock, "Bat Out Of Hell" actually has nothing but the shallowest emotional impact even when the music is at its fastest. Rundgren's production may actually keep it in check because later Meatloaf  albums were - believe it or not - even worse in their melodramatic tone. The changes of tempo are so obvious and deliberately contrived that they lose all emotional impact. "Paradise by the Dashboard Light" and "Bat Out of Hell" are so catchy that even children will sing along, it does not eliminate the absence of feeling and depth in the playing or the fact that songs which should never be put together as one piece are fused in a manner that could never work.		The simpler power balladry of "You Took The Words Right Out Of My Mouth" and "Two Out of Three Ain't Bad" paved the way for Bryan Adams to conquer the world in the 1980s and 1990s, and manage to sound as bad as Adams ever did because of the soppy vocals, which permeate even the rockers and are far worse than&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Springsteen/dp/B0000026E5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Springsteen</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Petty/dp/B000065AI3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Petty</a>&nbsp;could imaginably be. the lyrics are as self-conciously funny as any band could ever be, but should be seem as laughable by anyone wiht the lsightest maturity in their musical tastes.		Bluntly put, it is impossible to imagine a record so childishly overdone and contrived as "Bat Out Of Hell". Lacking any emotion or depth, this is a record that sold by the tens of thousands in Australia but is very hard to listen to even by the standards of the most pompous rock.
1,I have to disagree with all of the 5-star reviews out there.  This is not a fantastic score.  It cannot stand on its own outside of the movie.		It sets the mood, it sets the pace, but there is hardly anything listenable in it by itself.  Tones, beats, but hardly anything palletable without the onscreen action.		I loved the movie.  I loved the sound of the movie, but this score will fade after the basic theme of Batman is played.  It's boring and shapeless.	One star.
1,Excellent musicians, but easy listening jazz; maybe not smooth jazz, but not too far from it.  Being an admirer of her recent trio recordings, this recording was a big disappointment.
1,Simple Plan is every other pop-punk band out there. They are not original or new, sounding the same as Good Charlotte, New Found Glory and Wakefield. The music is likeable, but it never reaches to an original or different style. With about eight gutiar chords and three drum beats, they try to create songs with depth or originality like "Perfect" or "I'm Just a Kid," but it's obvioius that they are manufucatered to cater to what's popular with music now. Although some of the music is enjoyable, the lead singer's voice becomes whiny, the music exactly the same and the lyrics are predictible. Obviously, Simple Plan attempts to become the new punk band, while coming out with music that is just like everyone else's.
1,Erratic sound quality makes this album essential only for Lennon completists.
1,This album is boring. Nothing for anyone to really sing along too. I bought this for halloween expecting some cool ghosty music and I all I hear is noise, noise and noise.
1,My god he is still making crappy music after all these years....good god just go away!  You can sing pretty good but you cannot write music to save your life.
1,i loved there ultra album this album has some beautiful poems but lacks the energy of ultra it doesn't rock! ok, some tracks are moving and his voice is great but it doesn't stand out saying i want here that again except for maybe "i feel loved" with the trance/techno explosion going on and them being the grandaddies of some techno sounds they could of sold more albums with some more techno/trance sounding tunes maybe that isn't what they wanted anyway maybe its will grow on me?  i know Martin  gore has suffered to be able to write such lyrics don't worry it all about growing and some times it hurts as you say like all soul sisters/brothers bruce gilling
1,Shame to know the group was essentially a one trick pony from the get go, with only a few later releases able to do anything with what the rough debut attempts to lay down.
1,After hearing the "Essential Backstreet Boys", I bought this with high hopes.  The Backstreet Boys compilation is such an improvement in sound (over their original CDs), but not so here.		If you have the original CDs from *NSync, you don't need this.  If you don't already have the original CDs, look for them instead.
1,this dude has got to be the best example of the lamest no talent i've seen in years...his music is so querky and this guy seriously needs to get his head checked as well as everyone who likes his music...enough said...
1,Just what we needed. Q:What could be worse than a CD of Styx greatest hits? A: a TWO CD set of Styx greatest Hits! Double the swill! I know there's lots of you Mr. Roboto heads who'll hate me for saying this,but Styx were undoubtably the worst band who ever made it big. Overwrought,overblown,and sappy. Just to be fair,though, Tommy Shaw was a pretty good guitarist. Too bad he didn't have better songs to play on. Miserable.
1,Originally I was going to mark "Black and Blue" as the low point in the Rolling Stones catalogue...until I remembered this one! Has the be the lowest musical points in their stellar catalogue. "One Hit" is good, but the rest..oh my...If you want to hear this Rock group visit "Let it Bleed" or "Exile on Main Street".
1,I wanted to like this album, as I am a big fan of power pop with jangly guitars, hooks and harmonies. Unfortunately, this album sounds like so many other psuedo-"indie" bands: pleading vocals expressing the angst of young love, mixed with loud, overcompressed guitars that end up sounding like a combination of "CLANGCLANGCLANGCLANGCLANGCLANGCLANGCLANG" and "WHOOOOOOOOOOSH!". This ain't Phil Spector's Wall of Sound, it's Alternative Radio's consumer ready wall of noise. A couple of songs are ok, listenable, but on the whole, this isn't an album that I would consider for repeat listenings. These songs sound like they are tailor made for a Target commercial or an episode of the OC or Gossip Girls or some other show on the CW network.		If you like real Power Pop, check out bands like The Red Button, Cherry Twister, The Mockers, and the Wondermints.
1,I didn't like the songs.  Definitely did not sound like any of his great music. Money wasted again. It was disappointing.
1,Even his legacy as a Beatle can't save the new single from being disposal forgettable formula.  There is nothing interesting here except that McCartney is back from a 4 year absense.  "Jenny Wren" is a better song than this, which McCarney seems to have written on auto-pilot.  His days of being innovator are long behind him.  From anyone else, it would get nowhere, not a great buy, I would say wait for the album.
1,OK, Miseducation of Lauryn Hill was nothing short of phenomenal. With this follow up you're left wondering how such a talent could fall off so dramatically---and so thoroughly, and it's two CDs worth of garbage! Save your money and buy another CD from another artist. I'm just praying to a higher power that she ever comes back from this nightmare.
1,Spiral Architect, is yet another band who opt to exhibit their virtuosity, instead of writing good songs.  Are they impressive?  Yes.  Is Nordberg a bass God?  Sure.  Is there anything on this CD that is worth hearing a second time?  Probably not.	I'd be interested to hear what these guys are up to in a couple of years.  Maybe with age will come wisdom, and with wisdom, the maturity not to ruin their songs showing off their chops.	If you are looking for some great Prog-Metal, check out either of Ark's two CDs.
1,ok not great
1,totally love it
1,I consider myself a LAIBACH fan. I enjoy albums such as "Opus Dei", "Let It Be" and "WAT". I, however, think "Kapital" shows the band at a creative quandary. Forget the grandiose sounds of "Leben Heisst Leben" or the punishing electro beats of "Tanz Mit Laibach". Instead, we get a collection of what seems to be techno/house/experimental electronica music. LAIBACH was obviously putting us on with this EXTREMELY lame album. If you like repetetive and monotnous techno, then this is the album of your life. For those of you out there expecting something AT LEAST like "WAT" (industrial/techno) or "Opus Dei" (Industrial/Metal) then look somewhere else. If you don't believe me, just hear the samples that AMAZON offer. This is definitely NOT the LAIBACH I'm used to liking and I can only accept this recording as means of an experimental album, devoid of any commercial viability. If LAIBACH wanted to offend, they have mistakenly offended some of their fans by releasing this below par disc. Next please!
1,When I first played this CD I thought I purchased bootleg and not an "official" release. Recording of vocals on this CD is poor. Too bad, since the performance overall sounds pretty good. Disappointing.
1,To say Nick Cave isn't the force he once was, is like saying Vlad the Impaler had minor anger management issues.	Glories LONG gone, he's resorting to loose balladeering and conventional rock in a vain and desperate attempt to disguise the fact he's got nothing new to say and should've given up on this music thing a long time ago.		A new Nick Cave album is cause for despair where once it was cause for celebration. Ok, you can't go on re-living past triumphs (ask Morrissey) but the guy must have SOME of that early threat and purpose kicking around somewhere. Where's the gusto and urgency that drove classics like 'Nick the Stripper' or 'Mr Clarinet' ?	He's become a rock dullard, a pale imitation, a caricature of all he once meant.		He's got a hopeless band together. The keyboard player looks like Bob the Murderer off 'Twin Peaks' and the rest of them try ham-fistedly to be eccentric; playing at being rock misfits in a Beefheartian sense, but the sad drone of long departed inspiration means the sound resembles nothing more than a hoarse, conventional mis-fire.		Like a once-proud wild animal that's become old and needing to be put out of it's misery, Cave is a sorry sight.	He tries vainly; 'Jesus of the Moon' is appalling, melody-less and uninspired. 'Midnight Man' is unco-ordinated pseudo HM dreck in dire need of some serious oomph and pazzaz. Each song is asleep on it's feet, and finally, laboriously, drag 'Dig!! Lazarus Dig!!' sorrowfully along to it's spiritless, uninteresting conclusion.		The spark's gone. It went a long time ago, and what we're left with is lazy MOR for the less discerning 'alternative' masses.	Cave always seemed close to breaking point, never far from the loony-bin and his music reeked of that creative morbid intensity. But he doesn't need his straight-jacket any more. He's a summer season, woolly jumper and fabric softener man now.		I bet he even does requests....
1,i can't believe that jaques morali left to die the ritchie family to get involved in this project. the ritchie family was one of my favorite acts from the 70's. 75, 76 & 77 where their best years, with 4 albums & great success. it comes this album & they become a second act to village people. this record is boring, loud, undanceable unles you're drunk & you want to stomp on the floor for 10 minutes away. the only song that i found interesting is i'm just a gigolo/i ain't got nobody, that comes in 2 numbers, so when i pass it to my MP3 is gonna show with a break after the first minute+, so i'm not interested. victor willis voice is horrible. looks like he has a cold & he tryes to strain his voice to sing, & the worst is seing in the back of the inlay cover a picture of the whole group with jaques morali, incredible producer of acts like ritchie family & 2 albums of patrick juvet(i love america, viva california, got a feeling, lady night). what was he thinking? obviously on money from certain comunity. hope it served you well mr. morali & mr. belolo, because you changed the art of disco, that you managed so well, for s#!t.
1,Oh, Bob, I hate to say this, but this CD is not so good.  In fact, there are only a few songs on it that I enjoy listening to.  And what a pity!  The songs aren't the problem (as the alternate takes on the "Bootleg Series Vol 1-3" revealed), it's the production.  This CD is as dated as acid-washed jeans and squared-off nubby knit neckties.  It's funny, the stuff you made 35 to 40 years ago sounds fresher than this.  I guess you might say it's your "Eighties Hair Band" phase.  Well, a lot of us went through that and luckily nobody's going through the back of our closets and writing reviews of the ridiculous stuff that's hanging there.  But I have to come to your defense on one point; a lot of people say that "Dark Eyes" is good only in contrast to the nine echo-box tracks that come before it.  I say that, in its own right, that song is as good as any you've written, even if the guitar work can be described in kind terms as rudimentary.  Oh well, even Babe Ruth struck out.  And time has shown us that if you wait long enough everything comes back in style.
1,Have you ever seen one of those flat nosed dogs that was so ugly it was cute? This reminds me of that. The songs are so bad that they're almost good. There is a certain comic effect to this record that nearly rates it a three stars. Pete can't sing, can't play, but this is so awful that it's entertaining, almost!
1,Both are a let-down at the same time.	Check out 'POW' from The Broun Fellini's instead.	~!an
1,I liked that popular song from their first album, and they were getting some good press, so I thought I'd check it out.  This music is simplistic, bombastic, and monotonous.  Granted the gowns are novel and it's sorta cool to see all those instruments and stuff, but hey, when it comes down to it, the music is most important, and this music is stunted.
1,I based my purchase from the strong reviews I have read I bought this and Stares and Whispers also because of the Strong reviews..I was strongly disappointed  ...everyone has their own taste in music that being said ...I do not find her voice to be that strong and the songs seem to be weak...if anyone has a voice look to her sister  Scherrie Payne who was the last member of The Supremes...I expected true Dance cd I tryed to listen to the cds a few times but i just cant get through them ....I don't think that Capitol Records knew what to do with her...she was in better voice when she was with Invictus Label which started with her Band of Gold seemed they knew what to do with her voice...i will put these cd's on my shelf and thats where it ends for me
1,I'm terribly sorry with all my heart, these guys are anything but punk. When I saw the video for 'Perfect' it was clear to me that their main audience target was 11 - 13 year old poseur girls who think that dying their hair and showing up a minute late to class makes them bad. I hate people like that, especially the ones who provoke them...like Simple Plan for example. These guys target poseur girls and feminine g@y boys because those are the only people that they can relate to. This is one of the biggest disgraces that I have ever had the misfortune to listen too. I'm sure five billion more people can relate to me than not and those who cant relate are either A. POSEURS!!, B. Fake rebels, trying to get attention and fail miserably, or C. MTV obsessors, if you are either you really need your head examined. Maybe its because I'm a metalhead...wait no its not because I really like some nonmetal bands like Nirvana, Green Day, Sex Pistols, Ramones and more...in fact Nirvana is my favorite band (yes I am a metalhead). This album is an utter disaster.		Caution: FOR POSEURS ONLY
1,I guess you ought to know that somewhere in a series there is likely to be a qualitative drop off. Well if you're doing the Unwrapped Series this volume is certainly a rough patch. Where the others depended on serious jazz and fusion artist reworking hip hop hits, this volume features little of that style. This is a lazy volume compared to the rest. Here someone just basically snatched out the words, altered the tempo, and got an aspiring jazz musician to free style over the meandering beats and tones of the underlying songs. The couple of tunes employing the older tried and true style (in terms of both featured artists and orchestration) stick out like soaring thumbs. The rest of the tunes are like gnarled digits numbingly and painfully sticking you in your ears.
1,I had to send it back did NOT play
1,their popularity seems to rest on the tired premise that erratic stops and starts make music intelligent. how many bands do you need to hear use the same gimmick before it stops being impressive? the relatively unoriginal and monotonous lead guitar theatrics, more often meandering scale runs than considered melodies, are backed by typical rudimentary metalcore riffs. there's rarely any intricate cohesion between instruments or compositional substance displayed.
1,This was my third try from Amazon to get a good one. Their shipping offered great protection for the box set. Great book!	But, on the first one I started playing them in order and got to BEATLES FOR SALE and there was a defect in one of the songs. Cleaning would not help. Listened to others in the box and found other similar defects.	Box 2 the first album I tried, WHITE ALBUM had visible defect which caused pops and ticks on GOODNIGHT, and, also on ME AND MY MONKEY. Again, cleaning would not help.	Box 3 came yesterday. I chose ABBEY ROAD, it was it's anniversary release date. YOU NEVER GIVE ME MY MONEY has a similar defect. No visible signs. No cleaning would help. Just sounded like it was a long scratch in the left channel only.	Amazon's web site says there are sounds and hissing known. But, these are clearly just pressing errors.	THE BEATLES deserve better quality than this. Sent it back to Amazon already and they didn't even want to send me a 4th. Very unhappy with this.
1,This CD should be condemned. The bands on this CD have tried to copy the unique sounds of Roxy Music and Bryan Ferry...and failed miserably. I actually like when other artist sing their favorite artists songs. Its fun to hear their interpretation. In fact, I bough a CD of ZZ Top songs done by the likes of Filter, and other bands you wouldn't expect. They did a great job. That CD has very unique versions of the well know ZZ Top songs. They didn't just try to imitative, they create. Now, back to this CD...none of the songs...none, come close to the originals. Yes, they try to sound (to a certain degree) like them, but, you will notice immediately that is not Roxy. Second, the production values on this CD are awful. It must have been put together in 24 hours, in someones basement. I have no idea if Roxy has heard this effort, and if they had...they should have tried to stop it. The bands on this CD have done them an injustice.
1,With the exception of the Brazilian songs, I can't listen to this CD. I have been a long time fan ... ever since I stopped my car to listen to an unknown singer's beautiful rendition of Detour Ahead - the first time I ever heard Jane sing. Here she sounds really twangy. Maybe she has changed vocal coaches? I hope this is not to be a permanent change. I love her naturally warm, full, rich tone ... but I couldn't find it anywhere on this album.
1,I have been a Styx fan for years. In fact, the band occupies a special place in my heart. "The Grand Illusion" was released when I was in the 5th grade, and it was the very first vinyl record I ever bought. I re-purchased it when it was released on CD a few years later. I still listen to it often. It is a classic hard rock recording that has held up well decades later.		When I was in high school, "Kilroy Was Here" was released. I ran to the record store to buy it the day it was released. However, when I placed the album on the spinner and set the needle down, the Velveeta started to pour out of my stereo speakers.		"You're wondering who I am...	*secret secret, I've got a secret*	"Machine or MAN-UH-CAN..."		I couldn't believe that Styx would release such a contrived piece of  garbage. I invited a friend of mine, who was also a Styx fan, to my house for a listen. We wound up having an argument, because he thought the album was "really cool." So I placed a bet. I bet him ten bucks that the public would recognize this album to be a steaming dung heap, and it would fail to crack the "Billboard Top Ten."		Well, I was wrong. A few days later, it did crack the top ten and I was out ten bucks. However, my confidence in my musical judgment has remained secure. History has shown this album to be what it really is--a cheesy vanity project that spelled the demise of a great band.
1,My daughter recently received the new N'Sync album, "No Strings  Attached", and she loves it. I'm not so sure I can say the same,  however. The music sounds like it is more geared towards pre-teens and  teenagers. I agree with the person on
1,ok
1,Made in USA in 2002, Serial# R2-78298, Playing Time 74:57	This disc compiles tracks previously released on various albums, up to their "Brotherhood" album.	Selected after taking a survey within the band members (the process is explained in greater detail within the liner notes), it represents a "Greatest Misses" of some sort (they left out, on purpose, every single hit of their career)	This disc is intended for the "real" fans (i.e. people who buy their albums, regardless of the hits played on the radio) but presents no left-overs, no alternate versions, basically nothing that anyone that has their albums would look for...	"Greatest Hits" always present the dilemma of choosing tracks that a wide audience would like, and most people feel that one of their favorites has been left out of the selection. That's not a problem on this disc: every track included here is a subjective choice, based on the band members' choices. Even though some tracks do present some real "should-have-been-a-hit" material, the bulk of it is, well, pretty eclectic!	I'd say you're better off making your own choices and burn your own CD; this disc is sure to disappoint, in one way or another. I think it's also a sacrilege that not a single track was taken from their "Takin' It To The Streets" album. What kind of choice is that?
1,I don't know if I'm trippin', or what? I bought this cd based on a glowing 4.5 star Rolling Stone magazine review, which they almost never give, but I'm just not feeling it. It kind of sounds like some type of attempt at a modern day version of There's a Riot Going On by Sly & The Family Stone, but Sly had some deeper funk on that record. There are some albums that I didn't initially like, which have grown on me after multiple plays, so I'll try to listen to it a couple more times just to verify I'm not totally crazy. It's definitely different, and not in a positive way. Being a fan of multiple genres: rock, funk, rap, soul, and blues, From Jimi, to the Stones, to Bobby Byrd, to Beatles, Funkadelic, Al Green, to even country ass Hank Williams, etc, I consider myself a well rounded music enthusiast with a valid opinion. No disrespect to the musicians who worked on this project (super huge Jesse Johnson fan here, go Jesse). It seems like their maybe some sort of/kind of interesting musical things that wanted to happen, but nothing really gels, and nothing really soars? Many of the lyrics were mumbled and unclear, and I can't really understand most of the words he's even saying in the songs (maybe if it was some deep s***, I would have tried to appreciate/listen harder. I need songs to hit me hard right away, or within a few plays, but that hasn't happened for me. I really wanted to like this release!
1,Totally Forgettable release.		The very fact that the Japanese release had the Makeup cover speaks for itself. Its really another filler Album. Just ask yourself, how much of this material is in the bands later setlist ( as stilted as that list is).		I have the Disc, like I usually say, Any KISS is good  KISS. But the fun is more in the having the KISS stuff than enjoying the sound. When I do my compilation discs for my own play, there is nothing memorable here. Sad, but true that this is not a KISS album, but it may be a rock album. However, it is such a truism that KISS is in the show, and so very little, basically nothing, is evocative of the shows, even of the ANIMALIZE material ( recorded on Video tape). Another wasted chance for KISS to be *KISS*.
1,Okay, first of all, let me start by stating that I am not a Korn fan, at least not since the first album which was good.  I am a music fan, collector, and historian and this is one of the worst ideas in music that was ever conceived, and not only that, but the fact that a musician the likes of Robert Smith would even think about appearing on this makes me lose what little respect that I had left for him.	For those that are unaware, Korn is the band that gave birth to the mid to late 90's aggro rock craze, brought us the fad of whining about our parents to distorted guitars, a rocker wearing a jogging suit, and down-tuned so far that all you hear is deep rumbles of guitars and a clicking sound out of the bass.	Someone thought it would be a great idea to rip away all of the distortion so we can really hear what they sound like.  Now we, the haters of this band, have real evidence to the fact that their riffs are weak at best, they wrote a total of two drum beats that appear on all of their albums, and Jonathan Davis cannot sing or write a good lyrics for the life of him.	I did get this album (Though I did not Korn my money) just because someone had to preserve this for history's sake.	I know Mtv has been horrible for a long time, but the Unplugged concerts were usually pretty good.  This is the worst exception and quite possibly the lowest point for Mtv (which is saying a lot).	DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM.  DO NOT MAKE PEOPLE THINK THAT THIS IS A GOOD IDEA!	If you do, the next thing that Mtv will be trying to force feed us will be Slipknot unplugged or Limp Bizkit unplugged or any of the horrible musicians they play on their station in this stripped-down fashion.
1,Dissapointing. None of the songs on here are 'classic' material, and won't be remembered like her songs such as Vogue and Like a prayer. I know music in general is bad at the moment, but i was hoping Madonna would try and save it for us, nope! Still theres no harm in experimenting. Maybe she'll get up to scratch with her next album. Dont get me wrong this is not a really bad album, but by Madonnas standard it is bland, some of the songs are quite funky and by todays music standards, its great. But in 20 years time, noeone will care about these songs, but people will still be loving Like a prayer and Vogue. Maybe im the only 14 year old who realises how mediocre music is at the moment, but im not ashamed to be in the minority....
1,I don't think Cannibal Corpse are bad musicians. Enjoying death metal or not is a question of musical taste, every person has its own. And, inside a genre, of course there are good and bad musicians.	I'm not discussing the quality of CAnnibal Corpse's musicians. I'm discussing their character, their personality. What kind of person would, given the opportunity to make a record deal to record aggressive and no commercial music, use this opportunity to write such disgusting, bad, mean, obnoxious, insane, malevolent and utter evil lyrics?  Why would a musician in his right frame of mind do it?!! WHy would them hire artists to draw such evil cover arts? I'm not saying "evil" in the religious sense, I mean evil in ideas, in character.	I hate this band with all my heart (and this an evil feeling, I know!)and I hope they dissapear forever.
1,There were only four songs which i loved on this album: Loungin' (with Total), the one with Boyz 2 men, Ain't nobody and doin' it. I need love was definetly the worst song along with I can't live without my radio. Well  i'll tell you something Mr LL Cool J. If songs like that are going to be  played on my radio i definetly can live without my radio! This album was  obviously a mistake and i hope that LL Cool J can make material which is  worthy of purchasing. Very dissapointing.
1,Judging by its title, I thought that this is a retrospective album from one of those 'bands' that have arrived at present who are too young (or not that credible) to have a compilation as yet, whence it turns out I just found that they DO have a Greatest Hits album out already.	Hence so it goes with this 'band' who've titled their album ANThology, in pun to their band name, which is more similar to the likes of the packaging of them black rapper albums would coin for their releases (that reminds me of a certain attitude defined by Chris Rock on his classic comedy BRING ON THE PAIN as well).		And hearken - a track in this album comes as something self-confessional (the song "Whisper" (even the song title seem to tell you something of the industry moguls' trade secrets)) that they are a bunch of manufactured recording 'artists' who are molded into the shape of what the market have these days for them to sell out in the music industry - and as it went , the song states "It's fine by me".	As it is for all of how crappy things have gone to - like an anti-thesis for what the genre of Rock music is supposed to be in all of what it stood for originally, as an anti-pretense and formality-filled crud, these so-called phoney poser 'bands' who've gained ground in the industry today turned out to be the predecessors for what have transpired at present on what the Rock music genre came to be, sadly.		They sounded learned in their skill while purveying the formula of how they sounded like, but if depicted by an actor it would be a certain case of bad acting regarding the means that these 'bands' express themselves, as the genre became commonly acceptable these days, and even more so its that it's just because that it had become fashionably trendy, and its all so pass'. Hence goes what Frank Zappa have stated then, "Stupid is IN".	They carry on with that same buzz-guitar filled produced sound that are dime-a-double-dozen to be found around, mixing certain elements from a number of bands formulaically who've been notable from the not-so distant past by the likes of PANTERA, RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE, and SONIC YOUTH. The last bands that I ever really liked to listen to are GOO DOLLS along with them-post Korn bands by the likes of VERTICAL HORIZON (being not that too notable at all).		I've just gone through listening to this album after having played an 'anonymous' various artist compilation cd called DETOUR (Universal Records), which is half-consisting of the current "christian bands" that've come around these days, and its peculiar that the opener to this one seem to link on having some same lyrical relevance and similarity to the last track on the other said compilation album- an annoying track called "In The Middle" by an unknown group called BIG DOG, which speaks of being double minded about something, whence this ALIEN ANT FARM cd even went on with its second track that seems to level on that certain level as well, kinda like a song that's spoken in the perspective of the Creator.		I only gave the knack to check this cd out and took the chance on giving it a listen due to the reason that since these kids have contributed to the Spidey movie soundtrack with a song titled "Bug Eyes" --who's sequel soundtrack's the one I'm going to listen to afterwards writing this little prattle here at this point, which amtter-o'-factly is definitely going to be another wanna-be so-called rock band phonies' fest predictably.	And I see that the said sequel soundtrack also had a guest appearance of QUEEN's guitar wiz Brian May, who've committed some bad career move choices lately, and've currently appeared with a certain boy-band and on that PEPSI softdrink commercial cheering up among the audiences, wherein "We Will Rock You" is being blasphemed over by the likes of Britney Spears, when even its enough of a mistake he allowed that QUEEN track/anthem he wrote be trampled with.		What also got me to score this cd is the mere attitude that out of being a regular fan of related genres (where a lot of wanabe's have gained ground nowadays), whether it'd be comic books, films and Rock music - that sometimes its just that disposition of being a collector/completist that'd get you going for the some of them although they are not that authentic to the genre, a feeling that is similar for some of the priests and people in the vatican who would wonder time and time again about why they kept on with what they're doing in the part of the role that they occupy sometimes.		Peculiarly I never knew until I listened and get to hear it that they're the ones who did that cover of Michael Jackson's "Smooth Criminal" which's heard around quite well - and its on this cd. I used to be aware of such things before - but its just that I don't keep track of new bands and stuff these days anymore.		The psuedo-glam band DARKNESS came out of the hunger for a very good rock group to come around these days and tried to relive the glory days of Rock music's rebirth in the eighties by those bands who winded up being labeled as Glam-bands; but sad to say it never delivered as well...		The rating of 2 stars out of 5 goes for the album packaging credited to a certain P.R. Brown - who'd have the lyrics printed like strands of DNA.		Music-wise: it's a perfect specimen for such type of phony rock-music bands of the day.	Oh and on the last track - seeing by the player clock that it still ran past 6 minutes and going only indicates that there's a hidden-track as such... whoa bummer.		-----------------------------------------------------------------		For something worthwhile to listen to among those that've come around recently - rather try checking CHALK FARM's NotWithstanding and TRAIN's My Private Nation instead.
1,I don't understand the hype behind this album or the guy who did it. It made me sleepy halfway through. On the second listen, it made me sleepy earlier. This guy reminds me of Robbie Williams; an artist more into the celebrity of music rather than the music itself. There's nothing worse than listening to somebody try to be someone they're not. This is an album from that kind of person. Buy it if you like sleepy music that drags on endlessly.
1,Disappointed at album but great voice.  I am a fan but not with this cd
1,WHYY???????????		This album sent Kiss into the gutters for years.  It was made for the wrong reasons.  Kiss was always the anti-disco and they did this.  I wouldn't recomend this album if your looking for rightous rock.		The only reason it deserves 1 star is because of Ace and his kick ass playing.
1,This is NOT a great album, don't listen to what others might say. It is boring, cliched emo/emocore/screamo/whatever you might want to call it. The lyrics are pretty laughable for the most part. The screamed vocals are really hilarious. MY HEART BLEEDS NO MORE!!!!Alright buddy, calm down. Some bands write lyrics that deserve screams. Try Boysetsfire or Atreyu, for example. This just sounds like an immature person having a temper tantrum. This is a lot of whiny, boo hoo, my girl done me wrong and now I want to cry stuff. The word melodramatic comes to mind. If you're in junior high and your girlfriend/boyfriend broke up with you and you feel like that's the end of the world, then this is the album for you. Perhaps you can listen to it after you watch Degrassi and really identify with all the characters. All the emo cliches are here: blood, broken limbs, broken glass, and fire. The only reason I gave this album two stars is for the actual music. Some of the guitar riffs are above average, and the song structures aren't too bad. If these guys could grow up and abandon the teenage angst thing they might have a chance at putting out a good album. I don't know that it will be achingly beautiful as one reviewer put it, but it could at least be moderately interesting.
1,Although I doubt they meant their name to be ironic, the corrosion of conformity seems to have mostly affected the band. They are, after all, just like any other loud `angry' metal band. To put it another way, they are annoying, bland, crowd following poseurs. A bit like a watered down Cannibal Corpse, but not as funny. Who cares?
1,im not even going to say anything because it would result in tears.		NOT MY TEARS ETHER
1,Since the 1990's, The Rembrandts were declared a novelty act in the industry. Surprisingly, the group was declared as a one-hit wonder, but what does the hit lead to? It just leads all the way down into a spiral.	The 1995 album, LP, consists of upbeat and strong apply-made titles, including This House Is Not A Home, and sadly, their only one hit, I'll Be There For You, from the mega-hit NBC series, Friends. Sadly, there were edged into the wall, only from the popularity of Friends. Nevertheless, they could still make a good song anyday.	The bad part is that many people only bought this album because of the Friends theme. No wonder, they were unable to showw the true colrs, on the radio, or in the mainstream. Don't buy this album, if you only like the Friends theme.
1,Undifferentiated pop industrial music in the style of Nine Inch Nails. There is a reason you haven't heard of this band.
1,I was sent the wrong CD, but the CD I received did have all the songs that I had expected from the requested CD.  Also had many I don't care about.  Recordings are good, however, so still a good purchase.
1,It is that bad: hollow pop songs, a few great passages, but the soul here is missing really bad.  I was a HUGE YES FAN , but their last deliveries are boring and without anything to offer to the old loyal fans. . If Yes cant get a good record out, they should go home.  They have enough money, resources and fame to do something more interesting. owed to themselves and to the fans.	Also the new 2 cd live record is the same thing again and again, but this time with an Anderson clone that is not up to the original singer stature.  I am sorry to say this. I have had it with yes.
1,The question of if and/or when Green Day sold out has been rampant in the music world ever since the release of their 1994 breakthrough album, Dookie. Some people said that they sold out with their last album 2000's largely-acoustic "Warning," or with the 1997 ballad "Time of Your Life" (a great song, marred by endless spins on MTV, radio and school dances). There are even some die hard "punk rockers" that say the band sold out when they signed their names to their Reprise Records contract. True, "Dookie" sold 10 million copies, and Warning had very little of the punk riffs and attitude that Green Day was so famous for, but Green Day actually jumping the shark or selling out didn't really happen. Up until now...		Before its release in September 2004, the title track was sprung onto radio, and it had a fast-paced, simplistic melody to it, but Billie Joe Armstrong's vocal delivery didn't sound as inspired or emotional as it did during the days of "Dookie" or "Insomniac," and came off sounding more like Joel Madden than Johnny Rotten. This was a disappointment, because the song's lyrical content was an unabashed protest of the George W. Bush administration. Not one to give up on a band I have admired for a long time, I picked up the album anyway, after hearing some pretty good reviews about it. Only to trade it in a few months later... and here's why:		First off, the main singles were overexposed; American Idiot, Boulevard of Broken Dreams, Holiday, and (just recently) Wake Me Up When September Ends. I heard these songs everywhere. MTV, radio, every restaurant I ate at, where I worked, the YMCA, the local grocery store. EVERYWHERE! There was just no escape of the mas infiltration of the songs on the album that became singles and that, honestly, weren't even the best cuts on the album. I would also like to pinpoint that Green Day has also seemed to lost their sense of humor upon the release of American Idiot. Known for a long time for their zany antics, every time I saw Green Day on TV or in a magazine in an interview, they posed themselves as revolutionaries and social commentators, which isn't bad, but they took themselves way too seriously, as if they were running for office themselves. Them adding eyeliner to the mix also made them in the ranks of Good Charlotte. I don't have anything against eyeliner - I wear it myself - but it definitely added to their overbearingly serious approach. They acted like American Idiot would stop the Iraq War and just catapult John Kerry into office. Despite their efforts and having this record go multi-platinum, Bush got re-elected and the Iraq War is still going on. Come Grammy time, they were nominated for Album of the Year, and they were quoted saying that winning the top honor, Album of the Year, would "restore my faith in rock and roll." The band was shut out to the late Ray Charles, but that's besides the point. The Green Day of 1994, heck even 2001, would not have cared for such a prestigious honor. Considering that not even Nirvana got nominated for Album of the Year by the Grammys, such a statement could definitely minimize what little street cred they did have left, and make them seem all but pretentious.		Even on the album itself (press meanderings aside), the songs seemed like slowed-down versions of hits such as "Basket Case" and "Nice Guys Finish Last." Songs, like "Wake Me Up When September Ends," seem melodramatic in a way. Despite this, the passion has also been lost in Billie Joe's vocals. He never had the most resonating voice, true, but I felt more in his voice when he was talking of ennui in "Long View," and even bittersweet farewells in their biggest single for a long time, "Time of Your Life." Now it seems that Billie Joe is just singing for the sake of it, and the band is just playing music to keep on going. Musically, the band is still energetic, and still proficient, but "American Idiot" lacks the youthful fire the band was so recognized for isn't there. Maturity is just not serving Green Day very well. Surprisingly, it served better for blink 182, whose last album before they went on hiatus was commendable at best because they explored new emotions and new sounds. American Idiot retreats more of the same territory, but only slower and less enthusiastic. The great irnoy of that is that the members of the band seemed more enthusiastic about their social message and the impact their album could have had.		One could see Green Day as a version of the Who of their generation. They start out as a pure, no frills rock band, and their early output is energetic, lively and revolutionary. "Longview" could have been their "My Generation" (whih Green Day actually covered on their 1987 Sweet Children EP), and an early Green Day show was full of raw, visceral energy and the band seemed like they were having a blast (pun intended). Then, with the release of American Idiot, a rock opera, they toy with the idea of trying to tell a story with an album and expanding their musical horizons, and being pretentious in the process, and seeing themselves from a view that seemed unheard of. The Who were the same way. The Who's early stuff was brilliant and full of angst, and then they released Tommy, an over-conceptualized album that thrusted Pete Townshend from legendary guitar smasher to a psychologically tortured guy that writes rock operas. Except for a few songs, the Who could not compete with their earlier repetoire, and their latter day dramatic albums made the band draw fire from their earliest fans. Johnny Rotten even caled the Who in 1976 "more of a business than a band," which was a harsh blow because the Who was considered one of punk's earliest influences. The same thing just might happen to Green Day. More than ever, they seem to be more of a franchise than a rock and roll band. They're now playing stadiums, getting airplay on soft rock stations and seem to have lost sight of what they originally were. As an album American Idiot isn't bad. The band's first stab at an epic "Jesus of Suburbia" is definitely on par with some of their finer moments, despite being at a very non-punk rock 9 minutes long, and "Are We the Waiting" definitely could cancel out my statements about Green Day not being a very emotional band anymore, and can prove that they're still capable of writing anthemic songs with resonance and a good deal of energy. The songwriting, however, mainly suffers from the fact that they wrote most of these riffs in the past decade, with the exception of "Jesus of Suburbia." It's fine to make your songs polished. Just listen to anything the Clash did beyond their debut, or Husker Du when they got signed to a major label. Those two bands, both tremendous influences of Green Day, created records that both were accessible in their own ways and expanded the imagination of the listener. However, instead of creating this generation's Cnady Apple Grey (I'd use Zen Arcade as an example, but Husker Du recorded it in a mere 83 hours) or London Calling, Green Day focused too much on elaboration and not throwing new elements into their mix. However, even at Green Day's worst, they still are more listenable than their contemporaries and their followers.
1,As there are plenty of ugly buggers in the ranks of the Australian Knappertsbusch Association, we urge Deutsche Grammophon to drop its policy of debuting only those artists who are photogenic in the extreme. After all, there are plenty of guys with man-boobs whose musicality cannot be impugned: they warrant airtime. Sad to say, our counsel has been ignored.		This is my first encounter with Jan Lisecki. He looks like a nice guy. I cannot imagine him jaywalking. Perhaps Jan has a talent in Chopin - the world needs more surveys of the Mazurkas and Polonaises - but on the evidence of this disc, Mozart is currently beyond him.		Could this be the tamest K 466 in existence? I suspect so. I'm astounded by the shallowness of this endeavour. Did Beethoven really write that cadenza? Not on the evidence of this recording.  Equally, the performance of the great K 467 - the apotheosis of C Major as a key - might appeal to those who enjoy Dominos pizzas in all their glory.		Christian Zacharias, presiding over a diet-BRSO, has been bitten by a period-practice Nosferatu. His transformation into one of the Undead is cause for lament.		I urge our young friend to live life to the full before he tries his hands at Mozart again. Avoiding the Undead would be a good place to start. And what of the cherry? Trust me: the Australian Kna Association is not for the faint of heart or pharisaic wowsers. Our next meeting will occur at Bangkok Betty's Maximum Stress Relief Centre. Jan - join us!
1,The Jonas Brothers are geniuses in the same way Britney Spears was the most original artist of her generation. Basically, the cultural powers that be at Disney decided to pluck a New Jersey trio of photo-ready teens from obscurity and ram them down the throats of teenage girls (especially the ones who do not yet have enough sophistication to download pirated music from Chinese servers). Thankfully, Hanson was short-lived, as were The New Kids on the Block. These "emo lite" millionaires will be faded soon, too.
1,I'd give this two and a half stars if I could because that's all they really deserve. The reason they are rated so highly I feel is because of the lack of competition from peers in there genre.
1,In light of Americas misadventures and ineptitude in Iraq, Tacitus most famous line is more pertinent than ever:		uferre, trucidare, rapere, falsis nominibus imperium; atque, ubi solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant.	To ravage, to slaughter, to usurp under false titles, they call empire; and where they make a desert, they call it peace.		Some would say that his adage - and the latter line in particular - applies equally to the Mullahs of the Period Practice Taliban who, in their pursuit of ideological purity, transform monuments into molehills. Oh yes indeed: Hogwood is great!		To the disc in question. I wish it came in edible form. Garnish it with Himalayan salt. Perhaps it could be lightly toasted. Add a side-plate of spring veggies. Why so, you ask? Well, I want to eat this disc so I can give it the royal treatment on the other side or downstream if you prefer, accompanied by the trumpet voluntary. If it converges with the Beef Vindaloo Surprise from the night before, so much the better!		I so agree with the  review penned by SD. There is fine music aplenty in Symphonies in 78, 80 and 81 (I don't rate 79). They deserve something more than this faint-hearted nothingness. Being short-winded, hollow of chest and devoid of virility, this could be the worst album of the year. Its a profound disservice to Haydn. The slow movements in particular are perfunctory (listen to the opening of H 80 / 2  it has so little momentum, it almost stalls completely). Much the same could be said of H 81 / 1: at the mere hint of scale or profundity it goes to water. And one day Ill understand why clipped phrasing bring us closer to the composer .. . . . . Yeah. Nowadays Decca is poorer than a church mouse: why squander its limited resources on the Academia Bizantia and Otto Dantone? Thats easy. A takeaway pizza and they're yours for the night.		Its not a Dorati-or bust scenario. Theyre performed with plenty of brio by Fischer and the Austro-Hungarian Orchestra. If period-practice is a requirement, Goodman delivers the goods in 78.		Being a liberal member of the Old Firm, I am Pro-Life but not here. This warranted a coat-hanger job.
1,The first tract, All That Jazz, is worth the price of admission. The rest - not so much. Very bad sonics. Very bad music.
1,Didnt sell, wonder why! Sells tell a lot about a album
1,Meh.  Liked these guys years ago.  Now they put me to sleep.
1,THE BEAT GOES ON is proof that you don't need to own every record by a favorite group.		Excessively artsy-fartsy, TBGO is a concept album that was silly then and an earsore now; an obvious misstep for the boys from Long Island.		To be fair to this great band, "Beat" was Shadow Morton's baby all the way. Even when the record was reissued on CD (by SUNDAZED), band members had little good to say about their producer's aural mish-mosh. They're right. This one's a bummer.		<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/RENAISSANCE/dp/B00000GX0C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">RENAISSANCE</a>&nbsp;on the other hand is the Fudge's masterpiece!

1,With the exception of MOP and Mobb Deep (whose next album will probably be horrible) G-Unit is the crappiest thing going on in rap music right now, and Tony Yayo is definitely no exception.  Tony Yayo lacks any talent and really has no appeal about him what-so-ever.  I thought america was over the whole fake thug movement, but intelligence doesn't really sell too well.  Rappers like Talib Kweli, Common, Mos Def, Jurrassic 5, Dilated Peoples should get more recognition but they don't talk about guns and robbing people and other ignorant topics.  Don't support raps evil empire, they have a lot of people fooled, hopefully you aren't one of them.		The Zapper
1,Is not the type of music I was looking for!  I thought it would have more of a Parisian tone. It did not live up to my expectations.
1,As a life-long Williams fan who has loved his material for decades (particularly the Star Wars music) I was deeply disappointed with this score. Sure, there are a few highlights (such as pleasant, playful tracks like "Ray meets BB-8") but for the most part the score is just boring and derivative. I've given it several listens isolated and there's just not much here other than orchestral sound and noise with the periodic main theme or force theme added in for effect. Especially disappointing is some of the blatant re-usage of material (I don't mean quoting motifs and themes from past SW music - I mean the note-for-note re-use of material such as from "Han and Leia", which features a carbon copy of the Bespin "You certainly have a way with people" version of Han and Leia's theme. Likewise "Finn's Confession" opens sounding IDENTICAL to "Talk about Pod racing" from Phantom Menace, and I wonder how no one managed to notice this during the scoring session? I caught this in the theater and couldn't believe the same music was there again. Additional similar cues include "Star Killer" (I could almost hear Obi-Wan pleading "You were my brother!" to a burning Anakin) and "Snoke" (which sounded like more of Palpatine's theater music). Again, there are a few bright spots, but its definitely the weakest of the Star Wars scores (especially the final few seconds of the Finale, with the Star Wars theme played almost like a baby lullaby... how can you listen to this after having heard the bombastic conclusion as heard in the original Trilogy finales?)
1,perhaps you had to be there. but to me the defining quality of buckley's exquisite 'grace' was its, well, grace. which is the quality most missing from this overlong, overindulgent, noisy and frankly dull live album. i  doubt that buckley himself was particularly pleased with the shows they  recorded for this album (almost all the key moments of the grace album  misfire badly here). is this really the kind of epitaph a genuine talent  like buckley deserves? live albums rarely work and this one doesn't.
1,Take some "Wall"-like guitar plucking, some "Shine On" tubular guitar noodling, a bevy of "Dark Side of the Moon" chorus girls, stir it up with some reunion-with Roger Waters rumor mongering, and what have you got? That's right, get out your headphones, it's the "new" one from Pink Floyd (or more reverently, "Floyd"). In yet another example of the blatant formula gouging these guys have resorted to in order to keep the "Floyd" myth alive, and to further fatten their bank accounts, this lumbering behemoth is more than just a Floydian slip. Equal parts formula and rehash, "The Division Bell" is even more exploitative of the "Floyd" thing than it's patently derivative predecessor...what the hell was it called...something Floydian with another great cover. The covers are always great. Part of the "Floyd" thing. And with the passing of Strom Thurgeson, these guys are really up s***'s creek. But hey, let's face it, Pink Floyd has always been perceived as a great band to do good drugs by. And while good drugs and innovative music still go hand in hand, not since "Animals" or, arguably, "The Wall", have these guys breached any new ground convincingly. And that's forgivable enough, for at the end of the day, every band is selling their schtick, and a band's sound becomes their aural identity. But just imagine the fate of a new unsigned band trying to get over with this old bag of tricks. Pink Floyd used to get away with it because they usually delivered something new and interesting, love it or hate it. So in 1994, the goofy sound effects, the English voice monologue, the overused back-up singers, etc., all the perceived Midas touches hark back to the cash cow of their career, "Dark Side of the Moon". For anyone who remembers the experimental hits and misses of earliest Pink Floyd, after these architectural school dropouts deserted the only real musician in the band, Syd Barret, who put them on the map, (then replaced him with another real musician, Gilmore), then found worldwide success making records about how Syd lost his mind, it's easy to see why Roger chose the path he did, despite his interminable "Wall" rehashes. What has become lamentable in his wake is the awesome waste of talent and the sound arsenal of Gilmore and Floydco.	Notice how there's no song review yet? Well that's because you've already heard these songs in previous, sometimes several previous incarnations. Not only do these songs sound lazily conceived, you gotta wonder just how lazy the Floyd CEO's themselves are. For over twenty years Pink Floyd operated as a four piece live and in the studio, with maybe a guest singer here, a sax player there, but here there are enough extra players listed to constitute a corporate merger. You gotta wonder, who's playing what? One option is to get the DVD of the tour which should be titled, "The Exquisite Scent of Money".	Nope, "Arnold Layne" or "Astronomy Domine" this ain't. It ain't "Sheep", it ain't even no "Final Cut". This is borderline New Age from clever mythologists with alotta juice at the label. And the label knows there are enough sheep out there to plug into this "new" disc to cover everyone's mortgage, including the eight or nine extra Floyds. For an alternative Floyd fix, or at least curious speculation as to what "Floyd" might have sounded like in the 90's, check out Levitation, or anything from The Church. It ain't Floyd either, but it's a helluva lot closer to what "Floyd" set out to do before falling into their own trap.	Here was a chance for post-Waters Floyd to establish themselves as a freshly creative force for the 90's, and at the same time debunk Roger's charges of selling out the soul of Pink Floyd. Instead, we've got "The Division Bell". Plod on, you lazy slackers.
1,I have a great idea for the biggest and most well known plagiarist group of all time. Why don't you release an extra disc of the original versions of the songs yours are based on and refused to give credit to? God only knows, along with Page, how many songs they really stole from. From day one, if they had only given credit to the artists, no one would have thought less of them or even cared! It wasn't the money, but their ego. I'm sorry, when Page, Plant & Jones join Bonham & Peter Grant, in hell if there's such a place and they're $$$ means absolutely nothing, the first thing mentioned when looking them up will be plagiarism.
1,............... HEADSTRONG!!!!!!!!!! That's right. This contains the worst, most grating, irritating song ever recorded. Every time I hear it that song is like a sledgehammer to the groin. Enjoy.
1,I love the hit song - Baby the Rain Must Fall!  I remember listening to it in my youth.  But the rest of the album is a let down; it has not aged well.  The songs are overproduced.  His voice is wonderful but the songs and song selection are just aged.
1,In 2005, fans of Harry Potter feared for the quality of the musical interpretation of their beloved series when it was announced that John Williams, who scored the first three magical adventures, passed the baton on to another composer, Patrick Doyle, due to a bursting scoring schedule.		The big question was: would Doyle continue the style of Williams or would he do something completely new? He chose the latter, and the result is a below average score. And the worst thing is, it's not only average within the Potter universe, it doesn't even hold up when you compare it to this year's scores in general.		Writing about the music itself would be redundant, since already the entire concept behind the score is as wrong as it can possibly get.		As absurd as it may sound, I dislike Goblet Of Fire because Doyle made the score his own. When a composer enters a movie series with that kind of legacy, he has to have the personal greatness to compromise some of his personal style in order to continue the series properly. What Goblet Of Fire needed was a Harry Potter score with a touch of Doyle, not a Doyle score with a touch of Harry Potter. As a composer, when you enter a franchise, you have to honour the past and build a bridge to the future, not write something completely different in tone. Doyle inherited the best possible fundament from Williams to build upon. And completely neglecting Williams' themes, except for two or three statements of Hedwig's Theme, is in my opinion a pretty poor way to pay tribute to this glorious past. And I can't spot anything in Goblet Of Fire that future composers could work on either; Doyle went all the way. Instead of getting just a little darker and more balanced, he tried his best to become as sinister as possible. There's no room for any more developments when film 5 or 6 show us some of the darkest moments in the series.		I constantly read reviews and comments that praise Doyle for not paying too much attention to the magical aspects of the story. Why should that be good in a film about a Triwizard Tournament? Williams also wrote a much darker and emotional score without losing the Potter sound: "Prisoner Of Azkaban" had magic with style, combined with emotion and bombast. Leave any of these out and you end up with a dull, dull score, that's Goblet Of Fire; no magic, but ridiculously loud bombast.		Then I hear people defending the lack of old themes by saying that "Prisoner Of Azkaban" omitted several main themes as well. Yes, that's true, but people, please consider the circumstances!		Voldemort isn't there, so consequently his themes aren't there. We don't get to Diagon Alley, so this one's missing as well, Plus, the Quidditch match is about the Dementors, so the Quidditch/ Flying music wouldn't make sense there. The film doesn't feature the traditional "End of the year feast in the Great Hall", so there can't be something like "Reunion Of Friends" as well. Williams knew he had to compensate this thematic void. You see, for "Azkaban", Williams HAD to leave out several main themes, so he wrote some new POTTERish themes. Doyle on the contrary CHOSE to leave out 90 % of established material and replaced it with GENERIC stuff.		I must appear like a little Williams geek, but that's just what I think. Nobody can, and should, reinvent the wheel, but, most unfortunately for other composers, that's exactly what Williams is doing. He just continues to invent wheels, writing perfect scores, and there's absolutely nothing that could be improved. Williams nailed Harry Potter in film 3, so every composer after that has only two choices: either he follows Williams' rules or he fails. Doyle can come in and shove Harry Potter full of conservative, not to say bland, orchestrations, Elfman could say "I want to go this way", even Goldsmith could resurrect and write his best ever, it would not work; Williams nailed it, he IS the direction!		Look at other movie series he's worked on (Jurassic Park, Jaws); the composers that followed him either picked up his work (Jurassic Park 3) or failed (Jaws 3).		Then I always hear that Harry Potter 4 shows us a new world and this justifies Doyle's detour. New world? Where? What's new? We're in Hogwarts, all the characters are there. It's dark, but so is "Azkaban". It's emotionally powerful, but so is "Azkaban" (even more so in my opinion).		Williams summed up the entire atmosphere of film 3 in the first two minutes of "Secrets Of The Castle"; Doyle fills an entire album and never nails it.		The most horrid thing about this score is that even if Doyle's approach was right, the execution is so bland and amateurish that it hurts.		Sometimes I hear Batman, sometimes Star Wars, Lord of te Rings and even Die Another Day, but I don't hear Harry Potter. Patrick Doyle's music, especially the orchestrations are so bland! Someone needs to tell him that there are other ways to highlight a beat than hammering bass drums and cymbal crashes. These become sometimes so overbearing that it irritates you. And the dynamics! I haven't heard a single score that has less sense for dynamics and tension; there's no dynamic range to speak of whatsoever. Listen to "Golden Egg" and yawn!		This score seriously lacks, in a word, skill. Not one dissonance even trying to be unsafe even when it's appropriate, not one resolution not utterly predictable.		The themes are equally bleak; Hogwarts Hymn is nice, but doesn't go anywhere and the "Harry In Winter" theme sounds like it was looped over and over. Doyle's Voldemort theme is actually a version of Williams' motif, but Doyle managed to make even that theme sound dull.		I hate to say this, but this score sometimes even sounds pathetic, in "Rita Skeeter" for example, where Doyle sounds like he desperately tried to mimic Williams' comedy scoring.		The music is even worse when you watch the actual movie with it because tha makes you realise what opportunities Doyle missed. I do like the sound of "Death Of Cedric" and "Hogwarts Hymn", but "Hogwarts' March" is the most despicable piece of film music I've ever heard. Even if it's source music in the film, what has a Bierfest Polka to do with the Scottish flavour of the film? This is a perfect example for what I'm talking about: Williams wrote the majestic "Hogwarts Forever!" for these occasions, what's the point in throwing it right out of the window just because of one's selfishness?		I'm just praying that the producer comes to his senses and hires Williams on time for "Order Of The Phoenix".		There are also many people out there, mainly die-hard Potter fans, who think that John Williams couldn't come up with a fresh approach for another Potter film. You seriously underestimate him. Coming up with new sounds for a series was always one of his easiest exercises, look at Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park or Star Wars. There is no indication anywhere in his three Potter scores that he might fail at future films. The two scores he wrote full time, Philosopher's Stone and Prisoner Of Azkaban, are vastly different.		The crowning achievement that makes this Potter film a musical failure all around is the inclusion of three pop songs performed by some singing epileptic called Jarvis Cocker. The Harry Potter series, once a prime example for a blockbuster franchise that maintains musical integrity and artistry, has now also given in to the disgusting trend of hiring some noisy singers for a couple of bad songs that have neither connections to the film, nor any purpose at all, except for pushing the sales numbers.		My opinion is that even a John Williams ripoff would have been far more satisfying than this tripe.		Like I said, this should have been a Potter score with a touch of Doyle, not a Doyle score with a touch of Potter, but unfortunately, Patrick Doyle failed on all fronts imaginable, except one: he gave Hedwig's Theme a nice new spin, but that's hardly a saving grace.
1,I was told fot the second time this summer that the product was not for delevery on the adress I gave and I have got hundres og prodcuts form amazon on this adress so I have ordered from amazon.uk  I did not order this one though.
1,The Reminder by Feist is considered one of the best albums of 2007 but in my opinion, this cd is pretty forgettable. Leslie Feist has a truly annoying and monotone voice. The song I,2,3,4 is just pop dribble. People may adore this woman but she isn't gonna break ground anytime soon.
1,While it is true that Andrew Bird is an insanely competent musician and therefore could in no way be defined by a singular talent, his immaculate whistle has been, to a large extent, the sloping grand undercurrent of each distinctly-composed album. On Armchair Apocrypha, it helped swell "Dark Matter" to a stunning coast. It appeared liberally throughout The Mysterious Production of Eggs and Noble Beast. It is, despite weak snatches at the beginnings of songs, almost entirely absent from Break It Yourself.		Also missing are Bird's predilections for rousing compositions and involving, wry wordplay. Break It Yourself shambles along sleepily, weighed down by filler. At least two songs--Polynation and Things Behind the Barn--are shapeless interludes less atmospheric than they are fundamentally boring. Other songs like the droning Desperation Breeds or the meandering Luistania drag painfully on, full minutes longer than they should. In fact, nearly every song--apart from the interludes and the lyrically-unispired, 8-minute long Hole In The Ocean Floor--clocks in at around 5 minutes. Snappy, Break It Yourself, is not.		It would almost appear that this not an album of a master craftsman at work, but of an elaborate copycat artist who grabbed Bird's ukulele from the shelf and convinced his bandmates to take up their instruments, yet despite his best efforts, ultimately failed to harness the creativity or inventiveness of his hero's greatest works and so filled his time with nervous warm-up exercises.		Bird's beauty and grace lurks beneath a bevvy of fits and false starts, of blink-and-you'll-miss-'em whistles through admittedly well-composed though overlong instrumental arrangements. Still, his lost lyrics bend unsurely, desperate reminders that somewhere in the fog, our hero waits, biding his time for the next recording.
1,This is absolutely NOT where you should start out listening to the Sonics.  It contains only two cuts from their peak days:  "Psycho" and "The Witch," which were leased from Etiquette Records.  Everything else here is from their tragic waning days, when they switched to the Jerden label, went out into the big world, got their sound cleaned up, lost their way and fell apart.		It's very simple:  Their great stuff was on Etiquette Records.  Get the Norton reissues of their first two albums, "Here are the Sonics" and "Boom," or the ACE compilation "Psycho-Sonic" (for stereo mixes).		There are a couple other decent things here, but even the best pales against the other stuff.
1,Unlike Creed 'n Bizkit, whose middle name is "innovation," these guys just don't carry on the torch of rock 'n roll like they lay claim to.  Now, don't get me wrong, this record does have its moments of Seattle-like soundz.  However, the lameness on this record far outweights the rockin' moments, like when they try to be the next Beatles or something.  Trust me, music fans, if they want to try and emulate anybody, it shouldn't be the overrated Beatles.  Rather, they should take a cue from strong-rock gods Creed 'n Bush, and mold their sound to fit New-Age grunge, a favorite genre of mine.	Another concern I have is this: have these Australian rockers been on TRL yet?  If not, I hesitate to take them seriously.  Remember this motto: "if they ain't talked to Carson Daly, then they ain't the real deal."  Steer clear from bands who don't frequent TRL's show, either via countdown or live performance.	Alright, I'm outta here, yep, yep.  Peace Out!!
1,Most bands are not expected to grow leaps and bounds between albums, but mild Brit rockers Travis seem to completely ignore the concept and if anything, have slipped backwards. It is none more apparent then on this ultra-derivative outing, recreating essentially weaker versions of songs they covered better elsewhere in the past. Colder feels like the only song that matters here.
1,I have mixed feelings about this album. I'm a big fan of some of the early E.L.P. albums, like their first album and "Tarkus", though I think they got a bit too big for their britches on parts of "Trilogy" and "Brain Salad Surgery" (two albums that I still like, by the way). Keith Emerson could be a bit of a show-off at times, but then again, if I played keyboards as well as he could, then I wouldn't mind showing off from time to time also!		In terms of songs, I don't think there is anything really bad on this album, but there is also nothing that really stands out, either. There is nothing here quite as memorable and catchy as "Lucky Man", "From The Beginning" or "The Endless Enigma". This is lightweight, progressive pop. Its all very pleasant to listen to, but nothing here really reaches out and grabs me and stays with me after listening to it. I don't hate this album, really. There is some nice piano playing on the second half of the album, Greg Lake is in good vocal form and Keith Emerson doesn't show off on this. But..overall, this is a rather uninspired and forgettful album.		What DOES stand out are negative things, like the cover and the album title itself. And...on the vinyl copy that I own, they have all that "Love Beach" merchandise and those silver mannequins. This is the stuff that I remember the most about this album. I wonder how many "Love Beach" T-shirts and jackets and swimming trunks were actually sold..don't you?		If you see this used someplace, either on CD, cassette or vinyl, or if you are a big E.L.P. fan like myself, then I guess it may be worth buying. Otherwise, you can pretty much skip and jump over this one.
1,The sound systems used for this tour are top-notch on just about every track, including the DVD bonus. Then again, they need to be; the "artist" is usally lip-synching or just adding her thin, reedy voice to a backing-track.		In some respects, you have to hand it to Madonna (or rather to the industry "image handlers" she's had throughout her career, packaging & repackaging her, coming up with her "ideas" for her). The woman has made her fame & fortune with virtually no discernible or noteworthy "talent," and this collection from the tour to support her most recent album is a testament to that.		She can still dance with enthusiasm, if a rather mechanical grace, but this collection of recent songs was among her most bland. The DVD is worth it for Madonna hard-core types, but the only album any rational adult might ever want or (remotely)"need" from this "artist" is 'The Immaculate Collection,' which captures the best of what she did best--sing chirpy, bouncy, ear candy. Everything else has gotten very very tired...a long time ago. This overkill money-grabber "tour CD" (and DVD) is proof, though Madonna collectors will not want to miss out on it; as far as toss-away "tour of a recent album" retrospectives go, this is actually filmed and put together very well.
1,If you are not familiar with Manheim Steamroller (and who isn't really?), buy the first two albums and enjoy them for years to come.  The follow ups simply cannot compare and this year's Christmas Song is the biggest disappointment of them all.  It's uninspired, boring, and extremely dated sounding.  I'm not even going to go through the track listings as there's really not one cut that stands out at all.  When the first albums came out, they were incredibly fresh, unique, and exciting.  You could pick any one of the tracks as a favorite and everyone would agree.  Not this time around, and it's probably time to put the series to rest.  And do we really need yet another Christmas CD with Johnny Mathis on it?  Don't think so.
1,What's sadder than a bunch of guys touring under the name of a historically-great band even though they have only the most tenuous connection to the original lineup?  The same bunch of guys re-recording great songs *they had nothing to do with* and passing it off as "new" product, presumably as a way to make money that would otherwise flow to the current rights-holders.		Be clear: none of the songwriters and only one of the performers from the original versions of *any* of these songs participate here.  I don't know what kind of legal maneuvering allows these guys to continue to operate as LRB (rather than the more accurate "LRB tribute band"), but I hope they can look at themselves in the mirror and be confident they would have made it without the name.		Having said all that, there is nothing wrong with the performances here; these are highly competent players and the vocal harmonies are tight.  Only a couple of songs are significantly "rearranged", mostly these are just slightly more contemporary-sounding (often busier) versions with the current set of less-distinctive singers.  Okay, so these are still great songs and it might be worth it to see them performed live by a band of this caliber, but why buy this when there are several excellent collections containing the music these guys are covering?
1,In the mid-1970's, Mick Jagger had serious voice problems. Fans on the internet have speculated on the cause. He was unable to hold prolonged notes, and his low notes frequently broke up into a harsh growl. This was especially apparent on the albums "Black & Blue" & "Love You Live". At one show during this period, Jagger's voice totally failed, and the audience booed. Releasing a live concert video from this low ebb of The Stones' career would be like releasing a concert video from George Harrison's "Dark Horse" tour. Not a good idea. Luckily, Harrison's estate keeps that film footage in the vaults. And, in common with the Harrison tour, the talented singer/keyboardist Billy Preston is on hand to sing a couple of songs, to give the show's featured singer a chance to rest his sore vocal cords. But this Rolling Stones concert IS available. It is for completists only. Between 1982 & 1985, Jagger gradually regained his vocal quality, climaxing with his superb perforrmance on the 1985 "Live Aid" concert. There are plenty of better Rolling Stones concert videos by The Rolling Stones. Unless you are an obsessed collector, skip this.
1,On his first solo release since the medicore<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Forever/dp/B000002P7X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Forever</a>, Brown returns with new album. Similar to his last album, Brown attempts to write his own material with medicore results. I'm all for an artist having creative control when you have the pen skills to write your own material but Brown really doesn't. Given his past realtionship with Teddy Riley, LA & Babyface and his reemergence in the spotlight recently I'm sure Brown could have gotten some tracks for free. There are some standouts on the album in particular Don't Let Me Die, Doesn't Anybody Know feat. Ralph Tresvant and the lead single Get Out Of The Way but for the most part this is a subpar album from a man capable of better. Brown should have taken the route that Johnny Gill did with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Still-Winning/dp/B005NKIQ1C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Still Winning</a>&nbsp;and worked with current producers and then maybe he'd truly have a fine album.
1,"M.I.U" is generally regarded as the end of the Beach Boys' viability in the studio, but this is unfair-- the followup, "L.A. (Light Album) is actually better than would be expected and has some of the best songs recorded by the Beach Boys.		But listening to "M.I.U", its easy to see why that was thought.  It opens up reasonably enough, "She's Got Rhythm" is not the best song the Boys ever did, but its decent and Brian's falsetto sounds better than would be expected after the last couple albums (although Mike's lifeless verses are a letdown), and Al's retread of "Come Go With Me" is a bit lackluster, but its not unlistenable.		But that's it, after this, the record really goes downhill-- with several really weak lyrics more in line with what they were doing twelve years ago than what they were doing five years ago ("Hey Little Tomboy" featuring the line "hey little tomboy / time to turn into a girl", mind you, the music isn't much better, "Wontcha Come Out Tonight?", "Pitter Patter", and the low point-- "Matchpoint of Our Love") and half-hearted songs ("Kona Coast", a totally drab cover of "Peggy Sue", "Sweet Sunday", "Winds of Change").  In fact, the only really interesting moment may be "My Diane", a song of lost love Brian wrote after his divorce about his sister-in-law (yeah, that's something, huh?) and full of melancholy courtesy of a great vocal delivery by Dennis.		"L.A. (Light Album)" is really the last gasp of the band, while they'd put out a couple great tracks afterwards, this is the last reasonably good album.  Mind you, it has its share of misfires, Bruce Johnston returned to the Boys to do a disco retread of "Wild Honey"'s "Here Comes the Night" that is so horrible it needs to be heard-- it might be bearable if it was less than ten minutes long, although it was a spectacularly bad idea, Brian's arrangement of "Shortenin' Bread" is completely unnecessary, and Mike's "Sumahama" has perhaps the most irritating vocal delivery he's ever done.		But excusing those two, much of the rest of the album is superb-- "Good Timin'" is a Brian and Carl leftover finished for this album with soaring falsettos, great harmonies, and a killer lead from Carl.  "Angel Come Home" is a Carl piece about lost love and like "My Diane", uses Dennis' voice to capture the pain of loss quite effectively.  Dennis' "Baby Blue" may be the best he's ever written, featuring great verses by Carl and an emotionally overrun chorus by Dennis, there's few moments on any Beach Boys record that even compare to this one.  Really these three alone make the disc worth having.		Overall, not a great value given the amount of drab material and filler, but "L.A." is good enough to be worth owning.
1,I have been a fan of surrealistic Marillion music for more than 20 years. I especially enjoyed the early releases. However it puzzles me why any fan would rate this compilation "Misplaced Childhood" by more than one star, if any. I purchased it without looking at its track titles, only to discover repeated tracks in a two-disc, pricey CD set. Out of 20 songs in the set, 15 are repeatitions, two of them are recorded three times!!! This is  unacceptable and I would say, shows lack of respect for fans who buy the CDs.		Yes I love Marillion music, but I'd rather use my stereo player to replay my favorite tracks as many times as I want. The repeated tracks in this CD set are slightly different but this is not a good justification and there is no value for money here, especially at a price of $19.99 plus shipping. I do not recommend this CD set. You're better off buying the original releases, or pay $0.99 to download each individual song.
1,this is defenetily the worst album from Janet. i can't believe she did this. first single Just a little while sounds like a tryout song for a 15 year old wannabe-pop star . after all the superbowl incident she tought it was going to be helpfull to the sales of Damita Jo, wich are a little bad for the sales she is used to... the album is falling down quickly on the charts... to bad it happened this to the "ICON"...........
1,Not my type of music.
1,Stacey Kent has a tiny, girlish voice, similar in some ways to the wonderful Blossom Dearie, but without, as far as I can tell, an iota of Dearie's transcendent wit and humor. Kent's album covers, with their glamour girl sheen, reinforce the idea that she takes herself very seriously.  This album makes pleasant background music, but it's not a sit down and listen kind of album.  The songs don't feel lived in, and she doesn't feel as if she has enough life experience to invest them with the requisite meaning.  Still, pleasant sounds are better than unpleasant ones, and for that reason I give it two stars.
1,This is very dispiriting to write.  I so wanted to like this release, however no matter how you spin it - the record is boring.  To think that this is the team that created "janet." - her amazing collection of songs with "That's The Way Love Goes" - is confounding.  There is nothing to this collection.  Paris Hilton's release is honestly more catchy - and that's a sad day!  Jackson sums it up in the opening interlude "20 Y.O." - she says "...I know, I don't know, that's what I do know" = well sister, that is very obvious.  And like another reviewer said - keep Dupree in the bedroom and out of the studio!  I know Miss Janet has some more good work in her - this just isn't it.  The mistake began with the title "concept", that was a red flag.  Back to the studio Janet!  We love you!
1,This review is 100% about the quality of the vinyl records (2 x 12-in 33.33 rpm 180g., sealed, new). I don't enjoy tics and pops on a new record but after 50 years of it I have abandoned any hope of vinyl perfection. However, I do not expect to pay $25 for one album and find it has a 1950's stereotypical "broken record" cartoon backtrack: a stuck record literally. As near as I can tell from many (too many)audiophile pressings there is no percentage in buying audiophile pressings: they cost twice as much but have the most serious quality problems at the same or higher frequency. Perfect flatness and reduced inner-groove distortion are nice, but they hardly matter if there are loud pops and tics and a backtrack.		I wish Knopfler had stuck with SACDs but respect his persisting with vinyl. The CD enclosed with the album is OK for a CD. The recording quality of the record is good to very good but not another Love Over Gold by any means. The pressing quality lowers the rating a lot. In between tie tics, pops, and skips, the surfaces are very quiet, except where they aren't.		As with any vinyl record, only buy from a dealer who will exchange it 100% of the time without a fee, and be prepared to return one out of five.
1,Can you say generic? This c.d. is terrible compared to Beautiful Tradgedy. Why did they decide to go rock without the metal? I have no idea either but it was a bad choice. Songs like Ashes, Daddy's fallin' angel, Next life and more were all wicked songs. I wouldn't call In This Moment sellouts because they do have the same sound as their previous album just lightened up a bit. It looks like they took a lesson from Nickelback on how to write lame, radio friendly rock songs. I'm dissappointed, come back with something heavier next time...
1,It may say Revised on my review title, but that doesn't mean I like Clay. Oh no. I still despise him to the maximum.	Oooh looky here, I already got 0 out 5 people thinking my review is helpful. Haha, how did I know that would happen?	Let's review each element of this single individually, shall we?	THE NAME	Clay Aiken. What a name. What kind of name is Clay? Clay is what you make pots out of! Ha! Clay Pot Aiken is what I'm gonna call him from now on! But seriously, Clayton Aiken? No wonder he shortened it to Clay. It rhymes so badly, if I was him I would have changed it too!	THE MAN	Hmm... does the words 'Let's Do Broadway!' mean anything to anyone? He's so Broadway he belongs on a musical! Maybe he could do Cats, he looks kind of like a cat. Or he could be the Phantom from the Phantom Of The Opera! I can imagine it now... Clay Pot on the big stage, in his underground lair. Mwahaha.	Everytime I put this single on (I own it because my friend, who thinks she's oh so hilarious, gave me the single for my birthday), I can see Clay's facials! Eww! I got my friend to do an impression of him, and it horrified me. I agree with Simon when he said "I prefer you when my eyes are closed". I'd prefer it if Clay kept his mouth shut.	THE MUSIC	A complete joke! You call this music? The debut single from Mr. Pot is a COVER. Can't his writers write him a original song for his first single? Yes, yes I know "This Is The Night" is original, but "Bridge" is the main song. IMO, he murdered both songs. The songwriters of "Bridge" must be rolling in their graves (or their beds if they're still alive) hearing this man sing such a terrible version of their song.	Hey Clay, you're such a big superstar with loads of fans, how come you only put TWO songs on your single? Such a ripoff for your money. You can download both the songs for free, it's easier, lol. And you can still love Clay at the same time (even though loving Clay is something I can't apprehend at all, eww).	OVERALL	Some people may think from the length of this review from a 1 star Clay hater, I'm in fact a closet Clay lover. Others may say "If you hate him so much, why did you bother to write a review?", oh well la di da, I'm allowed an opinion. I want someone to tell the world of the horror that is Clay Aiken. And others may say "I don't like some of the music you listen to, but I don't go writing reviews saying I hate it, do I?", but frankly I don't care what you think anyway (my favourite groups are Blue, Mis-Teeq, Spice Girls, Atomic Kitten, S Club 8 and Liberty X, and I don't give a toss if you like them or not). Someone needs to hate him, if everyone loved the same music, the world would be boring.	Don't buy this single.	(And in the chance that this review doesn't get posted, I have saved a version onto my computer, so I can laugh at my own good review)
1,If I remember correctly in an interview a few years back when Jon announced of Matt's departure, that they would never work again together on an Iced Earth Project. Jon is suppose to be true to his word. Guess that means nothing. Anyways moving along. Matt should have stayed gone. Tim should be on the new album. The remakes of Tim's song are nothing with Matt singing them. Must be nice Matt to sing cover songs. Matt has a great voice, don't get me wrong, I will never question that. Matt should have stayed with Pyramaze and left IE alone. I was curious to hear Matt behind the mic again, the story is what I am more interested in. Jon writes great songs and music, now just waiting for the ending of the story. That has been more exciting than Matt singing with the band again.
1,I love most of Pink Floyd , I respect and enjoy David Gilmour's talent . On this C.D. he marginally re-invents the 5 note alien-to-humans communication that is central to the film Close Encounters Of the 3rd Kind . And repeats it ... and repeats it ... and repeats it ... and ... it is tedious and uninspired . The underlying synth stuff is 2nd rate Tangerine Dream . No make that 3rd rate .
1,Everyone in New York seems to hate Mr. Webber, and this show is always on their list of excuses.  I will admit that a lot of the music is exeptionally average, but he main problem is the lyrics.  I could give you  a lundry list of problems with the lyrics, but that would be tedious to say  the least.  Just trust me when I say they're bad.  They are so bad that  they ruin the CD, which has so much talent in it it should be hailed as a  modern classic.  Webber is definatly at fault for a the cheesey music, but  I have a feeling the music would seem less cheesey with lyrics that don't  absolutly reek of limburger.  Don't but this is you have any taste in music  or if you have any respect for the English as an art for.
1,This was given to me as a gag gift by a friend. After I listened to it I was surprised at how bad it was. While I will not call it the worst album ever recorded like he did, I must say it is really bad. I guess if you are a real hardcore fan it is worth a listen,  but if you aren't a huge fan, skip it.
1,This cd is not epic at all.  Nor is the band.  I bought this cd thinking it would just be normal metal and boy oh boy what did I get myself into.  After repeatedly trying to get into it, I cannot take this cd's content seriously at all one bit.  With a song like Agony is my Name, I cant prevent myself from laughing at it.  I ended up giving this cd away to a friend it was so terrible.  I like the way the band thought, but their lyrics are absolutely terrible.
1,I told my daddy that i wanted the new CD with CCR on it, and he got me credense cleerwater revival.
1,I bought this album because of "Genie in a Bottle" and "What a Girl Wants."  The only other song I ended up liking was "Come on Over."  This could be because I don't typically like  slow songs which is basically what the rest of the album contains, but I  think it has more to do with the quality of writing and the production. I  agree with another reviewer who said that while Christina Aguilera has a  beautiful voice, her album is over-produced and she is limited by her  material.  I don't like the other groups or solo artists of this type (i.e.  Britany Spears and Mandy Moore)so it says something about Christina  Aguilera that I was willing to give her music a try.  However, her album  eventually lost it's appeal for me because the lyrics and production got  old after awhile. I think that if she had better material and wasn't  produced to sound like everyone else, her music would be more likely to  stand the test of time and have a broader appeal.  It's sad because I think  that she has a lot of vocal range.  If you like "buble gum" pop,  then this album is a good example of it's type, and I reccomend buying it.  However, if you want more sophisticated music I reccomend another young  singer with more depth to her music...Macy Gray.
1,I am stunned with how bad this is. AMG called it the worst million dollar karaoke record ever made. I think that's too kind. Pure garbage from one end to the other.		Let me say for the record, I love the Who and I love Keith's drumming. How could this be so bad?  His guest stars should save it for him. It just keeps getting worse.		I have never disliked something so profoundly. I think we should destroy all copies in case a million years from now, an alien race finds a copy in an archeology dig and believes it represents human society.
1,Yes, another trend band! Wo hoo, now we can add them to such great classic scenester groups as Papa Roach, Green Day, Devildriver and other such money-grubbing scum! If you want a band that went from playing fake, watered down thrash to vapid nu-metal and then talentless trendy metalcore, look no further!		Recommended to fans of Trivium, Hellyeah, Atreyu, and other such great, talented bands!
1,Well, it's not bad.  Like others mentioned, there are a few tracks that are like Bent's previous stuff and they're great but not as fantastic as some of their earlier, amazing singles.  If you love the other 3 "released" cd's like I do, then this one will be the weakest of them.  The first cd had some cheesy songs w/ cheesy "guy" singing but it kinda worked for me and had great beats and slide guitars & stuff in the music to make up for it.  And they were just plain fun tracks inbetween absolutely amazing ones.  Half this cd, which is under 50 mins., is pretty darn good and the other half is kinda crap.  Where Ariels and the other cd's have me coming back for more listens, I find myself not really caring about this cd as much.  I still have faith in them though- they'll come back with a better cd. -- I hope.
1,By Bat Out of Hell 3, Meat Loaf's creative spark and energy is spent. Again recycling some Steinman songs as he did on Bat 2, Meat's versions pale in comparison to the originals. I do like this version of It's All Coming Back To Me Now but that's one of few highlights, and really that song was never great to begin with. If you like the original Bat Out Of Hell album, do not get more Meat Loaf albums get Jim Steinman's Bad For Good and Ellen Foley's Night Out, both which are masterpieces. Bat 3 just doesn't cut it, and hearing him butcher Jim's old songs can be painful. The lead off track is pretty good and has an obvious Nikki Sixx influence. It's really the only good track on this CD.		Standout track: The Monster's Loose
1,I did not enjoy this cd... all the music is filled with video game/galaxy sounds like I'm supposed to get a high from it... But errr uuhhhh NO!!! I think this one would be better enjoyed by those who get stoned...		I LOVED his first CD and I was expecting much of the same but WHOMP WHOMP... I think a bunch of family & friends must have given this CD a 5... sadly I only like track #1 and maybe one other near the end... I will be sure to wait to see what his other cd's sound like before I jump & run to pick up a Miguel cd...		Maybe good for some (Kayne Shrug)
1,A couple of note worthy songs by Lou. The rest of the album falls way short. The Eric songs are utterly bizarre and creepy. I actually like Eric's contributions on some of the earlier albums, but these songs just make me go 'huh?'. Lowenstein's material has always been hit or miss, and he's definitely a miss here.		Lou gets very personal about his relationship on this album, it's not my favorite stuff he's ever done but I saw a few concerts in the 90's where the songs on this album really stood out. Lou probably should of taken over and wrote most of the material for this album. The democratic approach to creating this album didn't work out and the results are a really disjointed and jarring.
1,I'm not sure why Joni would release yet ANOTHER compilation... it		does make one a bit cynical.  Unless it's to fulfill some kind		of contractual obligation, it just seems a bit, well, greedy. A		big point is made that Joni "hand-picked" these songs, but she		did the same thing less than 10 years ago with the "Hits" CD.		Anyone who is a fan will have either the individual CD's or the		better "Hits" compilation, which has all original versions as		opposed to the lame orchestral "re-interpretations" which end		this CD.  Those remakes show Joni in declining voice and smothered in gooey strings.  It's not a bad collection, but anyone interested in discovering the really top-notch Joni works would be better off looking elsewhere.
1,Sure, this album works on the same level as a fun dance album would- it's not dance, but it's something that you would put in when you don't want to hear music that is stirring and inspiring. And sometimes, you don't, right? But I wish people would stop making all these statements about how darn great Diana Krall is, come on??It makes me wonder if this is the first piece of jazz these guys have ever bought. To praise this and call it great jazz is insulting, to well, great jazz!!Diana is a completely middle of the road singer, and the catch is, is that,she doesn't really know what to do with jazz. She sings in more of a soft pop tone and doesn't possess any real emotion. There isn't anything distinctive or expressive about her voice. Her piano playing is lackluster-it doesn't bring out any of the nuances in the music and sounds positevely detached. I believe that Diana Krall is much more about good marketing, than she is about true music. There can't be any other reason such a mediocre singer has come so far.
1,I consider myself a reasonably smart person, but I have to admit that I have no idea what a Terroir is or why it might give a person the blues.  My American Heritage Dictionary was no help, having no listing for the word.  I bring this up becuase, while I have been a fan of Jay Farrar since his Uncle Tupelo days, he has completely lost me this time out.  "Terrior Blues" contains a few memorable moments, but on the whole it is just baffling.	Though the album has 23 tracks in total, that number is misleading.  Six of the "songs" are variations on a noise theme called "Space Junk," which are exactly what the title implies: junk.  Of the remaining 16 tracks four are repeated, leaving a dozen actual songs.  Of those tracks, only a few, like "Hanging on to You" and "Heart on the Ground" are truly worthwhile.	Ever since Uncle Tupelo broke up a decade ago Farrar has seemed to be in competetion with his old bandmate Jeff Tweedy's band Wilco.  Well Jay, one the basis of your latest album I'd say it's game, set and match to Mr. Tweedy.
1,I could review this, but i'd be wasting what Forest Law already wrote.
1,Jay Geils Band you can't go wrong
1,But Hawthorne Heights really sucks.  They are the most generic and homogenized band I have ever heard.  Ok, i'll admit that the target audience for this is the 15-18 year old depressed emo kid demographic but come on, get a life, and go buy a Ramones album.		What the worst part of this is that it goes around masquerading as punk.  It's ok to admit that you listen to pop, but please don't try to pass this off as anything close to punk.		I like to keep my negative reviews short and sweet, so in short avoid like the plague.  If you fall into the 15-18 depressed emo kid in high school demographic, then it sucks to be you but you don't know any better.  If your over 18 and like this, then your a media controlled tool.  Quit reading this and go buy Minor Threat's Complete Discography.  They are a real punk band, with real intensity and anger.  Not manufactured bull crap.
1,After years of neglect the Buggles are showing up on many compilations. It's true, Video Killed the Radio Star was a sizable worldwide hit. Except the US. It managed 1 week on America's Top 40. I can still imagine Casey Kasem..."Starting off this week's countdown is a band from England called The Buggles??? Far out! We'll be hearing from these guys for years to come!" I'm not sure what's worse for a band, having your only US single chart at number 40 for one week or not at all? (If I were ambitious I'd make a list of bands that had one number 40 hit for one week.) The thing is, Video Killed the Radio Star was a hit in 1979 with a few declining chart weeks in 1980. Sure, it was on the chart during 1980, but it's star shone brightest in 1979.	What's more embarrassing is it's parent lp 'The Age of Plastic', didn't even bother the US album chart.	'Video' did make a very minor appearance on the first Stars on 45 album. Which did chart.  And what most people don't know is Bruce Woolley and the Camera Club recorded and released their version of 'Video Killed the Radio Star' before The Buggles, but sadly failed to chart anywhere. I'll take The Buggles second album "Adventures in Modern Recording" which is, by far, superior to any of the above mentioned singles or albums. This even did chart on the US Album chart (#161), but not many remember. Go for the 2010 reissue on the ZTT label (sadly recently vacuumed up by the company trying to accumulate all entertainment in the known 'universe'). Btw, that would be Universal who conveniently released this flabby excuse on pvc. I do hold a grudge with the company. They gobble up more entertainment faster than a black hole in a gas and dust field. Their proto-black holes didn't fool me at the Orlando theme park. I was aware of every minute queued up in those attraction lines.	The 80s music can be divided into two eras. Spearheaded by British bands 1981-1984 was the Golden Age of Pop. This had some overlap in 1985 (I'm calling Dead or Alive's "You Spin Me Round" the halfway point) leading to 1986 and beyond. This second part deserves no name. It ended abruptly with the Seattle myth. There was pop music during the 90s. In the US it was pretty bad. You had to go to the UK (like always) to get great pop music. You could still get proper singles in the UK. In the US you were forced to buy an album for that one mediocre track. Mostly because radio had 'independent promoters' telling them what to play. (For more info search Payola)	If you've stuck around this long. Thanks. Wish I could give out prizes, but Amazon gets all my loot.
