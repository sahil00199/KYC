0,Works great.
0,I think the frames ended up looking great. I purchased two and it seemed a bit expensive, but once the photos were in and hung on the wall I really loved it. The while setting made really compliments it.
0,Very nice set for the price. Have washed it multiple times and it still looks like new. Fit my king bed nicely and true to the color in the pictures. I would DEFINTELY recommend.
0,Very nice  sheets. This is the second set I bought. Great price.
0,great measuring spoons
0,Easy to read but not so easy to set up.  I had my daughter set it up for me.  The buttons are on the back & the menu is on the front screen, but after a few minutes we had it set up.  My only complaint is with the brightness.  I think it is too bright for use in a bedroom.  I cover it up with a single sheet of paper to dim the brightness, but I can still see the numbers.
0,Good size and quality for meal prep.
0,perfect
0,real nice Christmas table cloth very nicely ade
0,The shutters are still handing, so they are doing their job well so far. No issues with any breaking when pushing into place. Color was close, but accepted paint just fine for a perfect match.
0,Sent this as a gift and it is well loved!
0,A bit smaller than I thought but work great and serves its purpose.
0,Very soft. Washed well. Didn't shed. Would recommend it.
0,small and pretty
0,I've had this number for several years and it works great like all the features great product could write more about it but keeping it simple
0,I have these in several colors. They are thick, soft, and absorbent. I do not use the black ones as floor mats. I use them as cushion covers for a black leather chair so I don't stick to it when I wear shorts. Folded in half, they are the perfect size.
0,This is Christmas present. It looks like a nice candle set. Sister really wanted one of these sets, Like the idea of a remote and timer. Do not have to worry about a chance of a fire.
0,Incredibile for the Price!! Rubbermaid Company. Definitely built to last. Holds all your pans, very sturdy. I was questioning before ordering but it came out perfect. Going to purchase more!!
0,This product is an excellent product. It works like a soap dispenser should. I would recemmond this to all people		Very fast shipping also.
0,What are the dimensions of this display case?  This information should be listed. One reviewer said it was 24" tall but I also need the width and depth if I am to purchase this.
0,This is probably one of the best purchases I made this year.  What a great little set of tools!  I have all but eliminated any kind of smoking problem with my candles.  The wick trimmer is excellent and the tool used to put out the flame and then re-position the wick is terrific.  I would strongly recommend this item to anyone who likes to burn candles but doesn't want the smoke residue on their walls.
0,Great for my non stick pans, great addition to my kitchen, especially for the price!
0,This thing is awesome!  So much better than the cheap plastic garbage.
0,Thank you Amazon for giving us the opportunity to study what's available	If not for Amazon I would not know about latex pillows !	This pillow is exactly what I needed , always waking up with neck pain and headaches , I learned about pillows I now purchased two great pillows and keeping both , one classic cool foam memory and this one , both in queen size , they give me the fantastic  support I need I am a side sleeper with broad shoulders , I now have no headaches or neck pains Thank G-D ,	Thank you amazon	The Best !
0,This item did exactly what I purchased it to do, make 1 ounce sliders for a party. I probably won't ever use it again, but for the price it was perfect and shipping was the same. Cleaned up well on the top rack of the dishwasher, too.
0,Way too cool. Serious as anything, when I saw these I was immediately reminded of Eggs Benedict. As a teenager, sent to live with my aunt, I made a sprawling breakfast every morning to the delight of my family. I was determined to try all the most classic sounding dishes I could find in my aunt's cookbook. Eggs Benedict became a fast favorite at the table, and poached eggs were my silent enemy when cooking. If I'd only had something like these creative and modern minimalist beauties, Eggs Benedict might not stick so hard in my mind.		Sera, the woman I gifted one of these to, simply grinned when feeling the slick inner bowl that means she can  (and does) use hers for measuring, weighing, and presenting for phleave "y" or a "n" in the comments. My boss uses hers for the herbs she has growing in her backyard. One of the first things she exclaimed upon how many more herbs the silicone tool would allow her to weigh at a single time. I was just delighted that my boss could so quickly find an alternative use for the bowl I'd given her. She immediately thereafter asked what the tool was really for and did a big ahhhhh of understanding when told, poached eggs.		I love this little set, and if just one piece of it can make someone else happy, intended use unknown at first, I'm very sure they'll please many.		I am one individual, not a robot of praise or criticism. I'm not a breathing advertisement. Positive or negative, this review is my personal experience with an item I purchased on discount - my words have not and will not be paid for.
0,This potholder is made from quality, professional grade terry cloth, and provides better than average protection from accidental burns. The potholders generous size and cushy thickness make them an excellent tool for baking and cooking. I cant speak to the quality of previous versions of this potholder, but the product I received in November 2017 is flawlessly sewn with strong stitching. Highly recommended.
0,My little glass baggie is always full of M&M's and never fails to get compliments and comments from everyone who uses it.  Highly recommend.
0,This product looks and works good. Very happy with the purchase. I will suggest to friends. Easy to use, easy to clean, and looks very nice.
0,Sturdy for drawer use. Measurements accurately reflected in description. Very handy.
0,I received my towel on the date promised.  It is luxurious! I love it!!!
0,Very nice product. Very fast shipping.
0,Nice small table perfect for next to our sectional when needed there or bringing it around to use mid way and tucks under for use for two people.  Understand this is not a big table.  Just enough to put two beverages on or keep your remotes, etc. close by.  The assembly for me was easy.  Basically built it in my lap and took approximately 25 minutes, I was watching TV at the same time.  Probably could have done faster if I was only doing just the table!  Attractive and doesn't look cheap.  Happy with it and the price I paid
0,My husband loves cooking waffles on the Belgian Waffle maker.  It makes his job so much easier since he can't be on his feet too long.
0,I love this butterdish.  I wanted something that I could leave out on the counter so the butter is soft and easy to spread.  This is perfect.  The bottom part does have a slight height that is great if the butter gets too soft so it doesn't run all over the counter. Exactly what I expected, awesome.
0,My best high school girlfriend stayed with me at the beach for the weekend.  She loved my Bamboo Pillow so much she made me order her one!  She loves it as much as I do!
0,ok product, but if you are menopauses this will make you sweat more.
0,Looks good in my husband's man cave
0,These are awesome! Great addition to my kitchen. Glad I found them!
0,I use these primarily for cold beer.  They maintain a drinkable temperature much longer than a frosty mug, and don't take up freezer space.  They are great for hot drinks, too.  Yes, they break easier than a bar tumbler - so I hand-wash them.  I finally broke one of them after a year of use, but only by accidentally knocking it off a kitchen counter on to a linoleum floor.  I'll be ordering another couple sets.  They are one of those unexpected little life-improving items that give me joy every time I use them, and are well worth the money.
0,Favoriate color!! Almost a mint but not that bright mint. Nice dish cloths. Soft too!!
0,Just received it and tried it out with my toothpaste and 2 toothbrushes with the steripods on. It fits perfectly!
0,The rack is just as described. We love using this rather than laying dishes on towels! The rack supports heavy items and covers the entire larger side of my sink.
0,The product was a s expected.
0,This thing does the job.  Gets under those big pancakes with ease and is wide enough to flip them without breaking them up.  I have had no issues with this item holding up to the heat on the stove.  Pancakes are now a regular occurrence at my house on the weekend.
0,AAA+++
0,very sharp and light to handle
0,Great so I can see how my oven heats up now.  Found out the built in control was off.
0,I bought this as a gift for my bearded husband. It even came nicely packaged in a gift box  so that was a bonus. He really likes the comb and the fact that it can fit in his wallet or pocket. It is a great quality and has a good deal of have to it. I would not worry about it breaking or bending if being sat on. The bottle opener portion also works to open a bottle. I have seen a lot of items like this where the opener part is not large enough to actually open a beer. In my opinion, I thought the teeth of the comb were a little sharp but my husband didn't notice that at all. I did receive this item as a discount in exchange for my honest review.
0,love these figurines.
0,I purchased 2 of these. I over fill them and they still have lasted a few years. So much easier to carry than the heavier plastic bins. This is the best one I have ever found with mesh.
0,Best peelers Ive ever owned...
0,Still going strong all these years later...great product!
0,Easy to stick on bottom of tub. I appreciated how the package provided a pattern of how to place each shape.  Super appreciated layout pattern suggestion.
0,used this for halloween costume and it was great.	Very frilly and little long, but fun. For a real apron it would just get in the way.
0,Holds about 10 packets in one compartment. (Divided into 2 compartments) I have 4 squeeze-feed baby food things in the back one, an envelope of candy coated sunflower seeds, and 2 boxes of Baker's Baking Chocolates.
0,In fairness, I did *not* purchase this item through Amazon.  It was available through my local restaurant store, but if you don't have one of those, or if they don't carry Update International, I would certainly order here.  That being said, this is a solid pot, non-glass lid with a clad bottom.  It works very well and cleans up well.		You can certainly spend more money, but unless you have to complete your set of AllClad or EmerilWare you'll save a bunch of bucks.  You could also spend less, but you'll get a much less durable pot.		I'm told this works well on induction, but I use mine on a ceramic top electric stove.  I've liked every piece of Update International cookware I've purchased.		If you're unpersuaded with only seeing a couple of reviews on this item, check the listings for other sizes for this brand.  You'll find that most folks like them a lot.  By the way, I also have several pieces of AllClad and while these don't have the same fit and finish as AllClad, I don't feel that these are second rate pots by any means.
0,Excellent
0,enjoy cooking butterball turkey and keep the turkey moist on the inside
0,Good quality.  I bought 2 for a bar area and they work great for what I wanted.
0,This trash can came today.  We have limited space so I am thrilled that this slender can fits in the space perfectly.  But, aside from its functionality it was difficult not to "play" with it after it got here.  Even my husband had fun with it.  You simply step on it, which ok other trash cans have; then the two sides open up like a silver mouth... swelling up my garbage in a fun sense.  It then gently ...slowly... silently closes!	Never thought I would have "fun" with a trash can. LOL. Oh, yes, the inside bin comes out for cleaning, putting in the bags, etc. Easy.  But seriously, it is expensive but I have other SimpleHuman things (great great paper towel holder)... so thought we would stretch our budget and try this one.  It is a keeper for sure!  Pretty, functional, quiet, space saving.... that's it.  A great item!		4/22/14  Additional info:  We have now been using this wonderful trash can for awhile now.  It is still a wonder to use !  Yep it is fun... my husband now loves to go put things in the trash to watch is sloooooowly close !  But also, it has some vents not he bottom which means when we take out the inner bin to put in a new trash bag etc. it doesn't get stuck due to pressure, the bin comes out easily, take out the plastic bag and then put in the new bag.  We are using tall kitchen bags now, not the ones that came with the can. we have had NO problems at all using tall kitchen bags.  They fit fine.  So this bin is about the most perfect trash can you can find.  (We also use the Simplehuman paper towel holder which is also perfection). so we have nothing but good words for this company.  And for someone who asked about toddlers fingers getting stuck in the bin or something, I would say don't worry.  The split lid closes so softly and slow that this would not be a concern I don't think.  We love it.
0,Help in cooking the center of the cakes I bake...outside doesn't over cook
0,Like I always say, I was always a Wilton gal until I tried an Ateco set.  This is a great set of different tips that make cool designs.  Highly recommended.
0,Nice
0,Item was delivered on time and it is exactly as described. Happy with my purchase.
0,Great quality sheets, look great and keep color after washing and drying - did not shrink either. Slips off the bed a little bit due to the silky feel of the material, but that is to be expected. The King size pillow cases really are meant for king size pillows.
0,No complaints here... made a crappy bed into one that is comfortable. This is a great product to use on a old or mediocre bed.
0,These wash cloths are very nice! They are soft and they did not mess up on the first wash. Since there were so many for such a great price, I half expected them to be cheap and to wear out after the first wash and dry. But they came out nice and soft and the color was still very vibrant. I am impressed! Thanks!
0,Great for beacon
0,I had shopped around for a long time before i finally purchased this maker.  I love the fact that the cookies are smaller and that you can adjust the temperature.  The only down fall is that it claims to tell you when the cookie is done cooking, but its very unpredictable.
0,I found this very easy to put together.  It comes with everything needed.  At one point, in order to get the shelves in, I did have my son help me to hold the shelves, but that only took about 5 minutes and if I'd been alone and creative, I could have laid it on its side and done it on my own.	As it was, it took me about 20 minutes to unpack and put together, and a good 5 minutes of that was finding screws I dropped in the floor.  They have really done a great job of making this an easy piece to put together.		To me, it does look a bit longer in reality than in the listing picture, so check the size carefully.  It is 42 inches long.		The shelves have several metal supports under them EACH.  They are well supported so they don't sag.		The shelves have a pretty brown color and they aren't the type to scratch easy.  They aren't solid wood - they are some sort of pressed board with a thick molded laminate on them I think.- they feel a bit like a molded thick plastic, but I was able to see from the side that it is pressed board.  It has a wood grain and is attractive and not overly slippery thanks to the wood grain and metal encasement on all sides.		There are little foot protectors on the bottom. They aren't big or fancy, but just note that the bottom of the 4 legs do have plastic tips to help keep it from scratching up floors.		I do think it a bit odd having the bottom so open, and I lack storage, so I have bought 2 storage baskets to put down there.  Some may like that modern tubular open look, but I just felt like there was too much wasted storage potential there.  I'll update the review once I get the baskets in and installed.	I do like this below my TV - it's nice that it is so open so it is no problem at all to run the cables behind it, and there's plenty room for the cable company's DVR there.
0,I was surprised at the quality given the price point. I wanted some Bamboo sheets, & there are two main kinds, rayon & viscose that are both derived from Bamboo. This set is the former rather than the latter, which is supposedly not as good for the environment, but I am not familiar with the process so I am skeptical whenever a company claims that their "process" is safer than a competitors. I would like to purchase a different set of Bamboo sheets (viscose) to compare, but I do have several different fabrics (Egyptian Cotton,  Sateen, Microfiber, Fleece, Flannel, & Modal sheets made from Beechnut).		These sheets are silky smooth, only rivaled by my Modal sheets that are softer, but are also starting to slightly pill. These sheets should not pill & appear to be VERY durable. The sheets are also cool, so they are not good for cold weather unless you like slipping into a cold bed with a warm down comforter, then these sheets rock. I have a King size bed & these sheets fit nice, & do not have as much of a tendency to slip/slide off as much as other sheets that are looser. Additionally, these sheets tend to help prevent overheating, as they breathe well & are well made. I absolutely love these sheets & will buy again in as the weather warms up. These are great for Summer & early fall if you live up north, but if you live in the south, there are probably good year round.
0,This mattress is a little firm for a foam mattress. That said, the people who complain about it being "too firm" are a bit off their. I have  I did a TON of research before I purchased this bed and is by far the best of all the beds that I tried. The fact that you can return it without any hassle makes it for sure worth a try.
0,Bought this from Amazon:	Pros;	  Easy to clean	  Makes 8 full Cups.	Cons:	  Spring can slip off the tube easily, those who have garbage disposers may need a couple spares.	  Instructions say plastic knob should be hand washed, the rest is ok for the DW.	  The metal gauge seems a little light.	  Made in china of course :-(		You might want to buy the Fitz-All Percolator Top (small size) with this.  The plastic one looks like it will not last.  You can eliminate all the plastic parts in contact with the coffee that way.
0,Easy to use, easy to clean and it helps avoinding wine stains on your table cloth! :)
0,How did I not know that these pan protectors existed before now?! :-)  My entire adult life, I've used paper towels as barriers between my stacked pots and pans -- but these Now Designs protectors are so much better!		The pack comes with three sizes of protectors:  the large is 16 inches in diameter, the medium is 13.5 inches, and the small is 10.5 inches.  That gives you a lot of versatility.		Because of the cut-in design, these also don't bunch up.		They seem sturdy and well-made.  I'll be sure to update my review if these start to show any signs of wear and tear, but these really are one of those great little products that make your time in the kitchen nicer.
0,The product was exactly as described and delivered promptly. Works beautifully in my fridge for keeping foods organized and easily assessable.
0,Great microwave steamer for quick veggies!
0,Work great. Good value.  My only complaint is that the edges are a little sharp.
0,This is a thicker and slightly softer blanket than one I bought last year from a different company.  It does cost quite a bit more, but it is a once in a lifetime purchase. The colors are vibrant just as shown.
0,Great bed sheets, cover, and pillow cases. They are softer than I expected and that is a plus. I recently bought a new full size bed that is 12" and so it kind of fits very tight. I recommend maybe a queen size version of this if you have a 12" or more mattress.
0,One of my fab dishes. Still have them two years later.
0,Just got it yesterday.  I am using it as a bra hanger. It came quickly ans seems very  sturdy but I won't be hanging belts on it.
0,It works fine for my deviled eggs.
0,When I ordered this, I didn't realize that it was a "box spring replacement". With our mattress and box spring on top, our bed is extremely tall. It's a very well made platform, and I would recommend it for that purpose. Not sure that I would recommend that anyone not use a box spring, though! We are going to cut the legs down a few inches so that our bed is at a more accessible height. There will still be plenty of room for storage underneath. I do feel a bit silly for not realizing how tall this would make our bed, but, c'est la vie, luckily for me my man is very handy ;)
0,Where has this been all my life! I am so happy I now own an electric wine bottle opener. I usually have bad luck opening wine bottles but no more. This is easy to use and has a Sleek and stylish look. Just place the opener over the bottle and give it a little push down and it takes care of the rest! Then to get the cork off you just press the button on top and it goes in reverse! This beauty also holds it charge well. As an added bonus the base it sits on is also a foil cutter. The wine opener has a nice sleek modern look to it. This just looks great just on your counter sitting in its base. It comes with a wall charger and lights up while charging which is cool. Not to mention it will hold its charge for up to 60 bottles! It did come pre-charged so I was thrilled that it was ready to go. As a bonus it comes with a wine pourer and stopper.		Overall it's just easy to use and makes opening your wine a breeze. Let's you get to enjoying your wine quickly. Definitely recommend this gadget.		I did receive this product free to review. However, I will ONLY give HONEST reviews as I rely heavily on trusting the reviews for my own non-discounted purchases on Amazon.
0,I like to add cherries to fruit salads and cutting them in half to pit them was a pain.  Now I just reach in the drawer, pull out my cherry pitter, and snap..I am done.
0,WELL worth the money!  Just make sure the back is on in the right direction - we put it on upside down.
0,super sturdy and works well, dip in warm water first.
0,We have a very small shower and this was pretty much the only product we could find for the shower curtain.  Installation was pretty easy and works well.  We purchased a ceiling bracket for the corner separately.
0,Why didn't I have one of these sooner?
0,Needed for drying delicate & cloth diapers.  Works GREAT.  No ugly line constantly in yard.  Light weight & easy to set up.
0,We love this bathmat in our spa themed bathroom.  It adds a nice touch and is easily wiped clean with a damp rag.  I've stepped out of the shower onto this mat numerous times (as well as the rest of my family) and haven't slipped once.  Great product--glad I purchased it!
0,We really wanted  a big ottoman that had storage space inside. This is the nicest one, at a reasonable price, that we found.  It scores well on both quality and function and fills the space in front of our large sectional.
0,Always keep them motivated:)
0,great mug
0,I love this turntable and use it all the time.  It rotates easily but stands firm if you don't move it.  When rotating, it moves smoothly to allow a clean line.  (it doesn't tilt)
0,I wanted a small set of cutters to make treats for my pomeranian, so ordered this cute set in its own little tin. The tin gives good protection from damage and keeps everything together. Just to let you know, there was no recipe included even it was listed as enclosed on the tin. No biggie for me, but it might be for you.
0,Didn't think this would work for me, but it did.  Will recommend to my friends
0,so handy! I never want to get out the ironing board if I'm just ironing one item, so this is perfect for the top of the washer or dryer and the lazy/impatient person. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
0,I am super impressed! I'm buying more! We camp and I bought these towels to put in our camper.  They are perfect! And there's no way I can beat the price! I am more than satisfied!!
0,I've had my Tatami mat and Futon combo for a little over two months now and I gotta say I love it. It's a little rough now and then.. And if I were magically offered a full, thick mattress I'd cry tears of uncontrollable joy. BUT.		I like it. I can fold everything up, it's easy enough to wipe down and it gives a nice place to sit		The smell people are talking about is GREAT. It's like freshly cut grass. It's a lovely scent. Strong, yes.. but it makes your room smell like the outdoors which is always a bonus in my book!
0,works well
0,These are the best kitchen scissors I've owned. Love how they are multifunctional. They even cut copy paper. They clean up easy. So, glad I purchased these!
0,For years the kids have given me thimbles from all their travels.  So many thimbles and what to do with them...now they all have a special spot.  This little case feels well made and sturdy.
0,Worked great
0,it serves its purpose... small and compact too
0,My wife is the resident expert and she reported no problems in washing these sheets before first use.		 They fit our queen size mattress very nicely.		 And I love the way the feel. They feel like  well  flannel. Kind of soft, kind of welcoming like your pajamas when you were a kid. The flannel pillow cases are nice to snuggle into.		 Fortunately we had a few days of unseasonably cool weather while testing and these sheets were just so nice to climb between at night. In the winter, with the bed warmer on, I think it will be a little slice of heaven, though I am not looking forward to cold weather when summer hasn't even officially started yet.		 On the whole, I can some these sheets up in one word: nice.		Jerry
0,Keeping your knives sharp is something that a lot of home cooks neglect.  They think that running a chef's steel across the knife occasionally is good enough.  In actuality running a steel over your knife just gets rid of the burr on the edge, it isn't meant to "sharpen" the blade. You should be sharpening your knives on a fairly regular basis.  This keeps the blades from developing bad burrs and extends the life of the edge.  I have a set of J.A. Henkels that I normally sharpen every month.  This month I waited until I got this sharpener to try out.  None of my blades were completely dull but they all needed a bit of a touch up.  This brought them to a really nice edge.  I checked all the knives that I sharpened and they all had nice burr free edges. They had gotten measurably sharper.  This was much easier than using my sharpening stones. I would recommend this for anyone that likes to keep their knives sharp without having to use sharpening stones.		note: I received a discount on this product for my review, however that discount did not affect my views on the product.
0,These are so cute! I purchased them to have the women at my bridal shower fill out with their favorite recipes.
0,Love the SHOWER CURTAIN - but it's much darker than appears in the picture...if it looked like the picture I'd give it 6 stars! The colors between the lines is a couple of shades darker than it appears in the picture...I needed something to lighten the room -- I'm using it, but overall is too dark for a small room.  I do LOVE the chenille - the feel is wonderful!
0,Nice theme... quality not the best...
0,Excellent portable bed.  Very nice height and very very stable.  This replaced my old AreoBed that was used for extra guests.  This Lazery is much better primarily because of height and stability when getting on/off or just sitting on edge.  A nice touch is the rounded top edge that gives a sense of safety for those who roll around in their sleep.  I just used a standard twin bed mattress pad and sheet set.  The fitted bottom sheet and mattress pad gripped nicely.  Will definitely order more of these as our other AreoBed's wear out!
0,My son has a tiny linen closet that I put this in.  It workes great for small items.  The pockets are mesh for good air circulation.  Good size pockets as well.
0,I bought these while in Ireland and was running low. Didn't want run out of my Irish 'fix' when we hit fall and winter. Love this products earthy smell!
0,Perfect
0,I was looking for a very firm twin xl mattress.  I'm a huge guy and need a very firm mattress to support my body weigh.  The mattress arrived on time, unpacked it and let it expand for a day and a half, and then slept on it that night.  It fits my needs without any problems.  My whole body can relax once again, yet feel supported.  I no longer wake up in the morning with my back hurting, as well as other aches and pains elsewhere from the old mattress.		Only time will tell how long this mattress holds up.  But hopefully it will last a few years.  I will update my review as time goes on, but for now, I'm enjoying it.
0,It holds lots of bananas and it doesn't tip over and very pretty to look at.
0,a very nice box -- what i was looking for.
0,Got these for a gift. She loves it!
0,Let me begin by saying that I am a woman, who recently turned 60, and who is normally totally inept when it comes to putting these kinds of things together. However, since I had family coming for Thanksgiving (and a relatively small guest room), I thought I would try to put this together to see if I could open a little space in the room. Well, I did it! I was amazed at how easy this was to assemble. Sure, you needed screwdrivers (but I could handle that). I did need some help in attaching the television to the stand (not very coordinated or strong, either). But, I will say it made a major difference in the room. Besides freeing up some much needed space from the bulky stand I was previously using, it is very attractive and has room for 'storage' which makes it perfect. I am so happy with this and I know you will be, too.
0,Great deal for the price
0,Works great.  I truly needed a new one and this fit my need for kitchen gadgets.  A real necessity and easy opening of cans.
0,This is a great map. Even better when it's framed! We ended up getting the USVI map as well.
0,Great as always
0,This is quick and easy to use.  It's a little noisy but they all are.  I've had it about six month and use it daily with no issues so far.  Perfect for making coffee with a french press in my office.
0,I bought this out of the open box section. It usually does great but once every few weeks it shuts down like it doesn't want to work but after about 24hrs it works like normal
0,great
0,It works great. It cleans easy. It does not warp on medium flame on gas cook top.  I would buy it again.
0,These are the real ma-coy!  I thought the caps were separate, but they are locked on, and require a twist to open and close.  Won't have to worry about loosing them.  The material is high quality and much thicker than the cheap ones you find in the stores.  Very cool and retro!  I mostly wanted one for mayonnaise that can be filled easily, but am using all three.
0,This tree storage case is so sturdy! It holds my 8 ft tree easily. The construction is durable witha two way zipper.
0,Arrived quickly. This is an excellent tool. Works wonderfully for cold filtered coffee.
0,Ordered Queen size mattress pad for the guest bed, fits well and like the 10 year warranty.  Since I did not have any water spill so far and I don't know the extend of the waterproof function; therefore I gave it 4 stars.  It is thinner than anticipated but it is well made with a waterproof backing and soft feel on top.  The advantage of a thinner material is that it can be washed in non-commercial washer and will end up saving money in the long run.  Would recommend this product.
0,Great for peeling very thin delicate skin on fruits or vegetables (plums, peaches, kiwi, tomatoes, peppers, grapes, cherries)
0,Perfect. Speedy Delivery.
0,This is such a great blanket! It washes up nice & it does well in the dryer! And the color is just wonderful! Would recommend this product to everybody!
0,It works!!!
0,Fabric chairs even with kids! It's like dress-up for your chairs. A quick makeover and you can transform your room. They are lovely soft stretch fabric, super easy to put on the chairs. They look like expensive fabric chairs. But I can pop them into the washer any time my kids get them messy! Win-win!
0,Great
0,I like it a lot, very sturdy
0,Good product.  Just right for me.
0,Love these! Super cute
0,A keeper.  The blade could be a bit sharper though.  Its easy to clean, small and not loud like the larger models.  Does the same thing as the biggies do.  Good design.
0,Weighs accurately and repeatably, small and easy to stow away.
0,Perfect for small closets!
0,high quality item,
0,This dehumidifier is perfect for my daughters room. It's small and fairly quiet. It's amazing how much water we have already emptied.
0,I love it . I have had it for over 2 yrs. Of course, I apply teak oil to it every two wks but it still looks amazing.
0,Excellent torch! Much better than the one I had purchased from W.S. years ago. Even better than all the ones I've used working in kitchens for 20 years. Fast delivery. Off switch for safety. Easy to fill, adjustable flame and never has trouble lighting.
0,Great looking. Fast boil. Well-made.
0,The first thing I saw upon opening the box was a notice informing me that this device is completely American made and supported. Awesome! I couldn't wait to call their tech support line and talk to a fellow American. Alas, there was no reason to call. Everything works perfectly and it was so easy to use, I didn't need help.		It's ready to go as soon as you pull off the plastic wrap. I did remove the filters and put them back in. Very simple to do. The unit is fairly compact and lightweight.		So far, so good, so I plugged it in and turned it on. LOUD, O SO LOUD. I guess that's great if you want plenty of white noise. I pushed the button again for medium. A little better, but still too Loud. Ok... I pressed the button once more for low. Low is much quieter, but I still had to turn up the tv some. Since the room wasn't too stinky, I figured Low was good. A couple hours later when my husband came home, he couldn't smell the cooking scents in kitchen, so it's effective.
0,If you just need a simple and modest scale on a practical budget for occasional use that measures accurately and doesn't have a bunch of fancy unnecessary features, this is perfect.		I'm using this to measure out ingredients for soap making, and am glad I purchased it! It's lightweight, made of plastic, but it does the job. What more do you need? I suppose if you're using it heavily every day for the next several years you may want to buy something a little more durable.
0,This does smell good but the scent doesn't last too long.  I spray it on cedar balls once in a while.
0,I love the feel and how they  clean my dishes. Good thick and absorbent. Dries fast when it gets wet so I haven't had a smell problem. Plan on getting mor for myself and family members. Will make a great Christmas gift.
0,The citrus color is a great lemon yellow. It matches my sons yellow and red Curious George room. The pattern looks good and the quality is good.
0,High quality!
0,These risers are great for a couch. I only have the 5" under the legs; we have put over 550 pounds on the couch and the risers still look and function great. They are larger than I expected for some reason but looking at the product photo here at amazon, I have no reason to be surprised. The front risers are on a rug and the back two are on a wooden floor. They slide easily if I dropped something behind the couch and stay put through any movement made while sitting on the sofa.		btw, this sofa cover (pictured) is the best!!!

0,I bought this rack to hang over my shower wall because I do not like the over the shower head baskets.  It looks nice.  My only concern is that the "hooks" for over the door are so wide (it is made for a regular door, not a shower door) that I had to put felt pads on the hooks to keep the whole unit from sliding around.		Overall, this is a good deal for a good unit.		- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -		As a buyer myself I rely on these reviews when I purchase so if you appreciate the time I spent on writing this up, please mark the "yes" at the end of this review when it asks if it was helpful.
0,This pan is awesome! It looks and cooks great. I really like the stainless steel handle. The pre-seasoning isn't very good though. I scrubbed mine with a green scotch bright pad in hot soap water until the water wasn't black anymore, then seasoned it with a very thin coat of canola oil in a 450 degree oven.		The first thing I cooked was fried potatoes and scrambled eggs. I had virtually no sticking.
0,A must have for any Willow Tree enthusiast. I purchased this for my mom, as a grandma gift. She watches my son during the day and she loved this figurine.
0,The finish on this flag case is amazing.  All the seams are perfectly aligned and the edges are smooth and nicely finished.	There were no burs or mismatched edges at all and my grandfathers flag fit perfectly inside.		People have been complaining about the Chinese made flag cases.  Why go cheap? Spend the money and pay tribute to sacrifices made by our troops. Put their flag into a case you can be proud of.
0,When I took this toaster out of the box, it seemed a little flimsy to me, especially compared to the four slice toaster we already had.  Perhaps it's just because it is lighter, but it doesn't seem as solid in general.  It works well enough and the toast doesn't get burnt on the original setting.  I like that there is a "bagel" button, but the toaster did smell really chemical-ish when I first got it.  It is is nice color and it takes up less room than our other one, so that's good, but I can't say I'm overly impressed or anything.  It's a toaster.  It works.  I'll take it.
0,I am very pleased with this purchase - not too big. Just the right size and looks great in my living room next to the cabinet holding my elephant collection. Good value as well.
0,such divine quality, and just a shape thats a bit unusual.
0,Forget the flat irons or irons and straight edge.  Do yourself a favor and get this for sealing your Mylar bags.  It's very quick and creates a ridged and perfect seal in under five seconds.  If you are going through time and effort to store food get a tool that really works and works well.
0,I purchased this organizer as a place for my roommate to put all of her little shampoo and conditioner tubes that come with hair dye (there's always extra which one is supposed to continue to use in between colorings, but I guess she just winds up stockpiling leftovers and using her regular shampoo and conditioner, which claim to be good for dyed hair), but it would also be handy for anyone like me who accumulates travel-sized shampoos and conditioners from hotel stays. (In my roommate's defense, some of the items in the photo are my conditioners left over from lightening my hair, because I use toning products to cancel out any leftover orange or yellow.)
0,Excellent
0,Thick card stock and the gold lettering is bold.
0,A little pricy but nice set.
0,Not bad for a basic chair. If you want something more comfortable your going to have to pay a lot more.
0,The rolling wooden cart is ideal for a wet bar which is what I am using it for. Does not take up a log of space with a lot of room.
0,Worked great for holding hats!
0,I love these coasters! They're extremely durable and come in a very nice tin. While I'd love to give them 5 stars there is one small problem. The plastic material they're made with sticks to the bottom of your cup very easily so you have to hold the coaster when lifting your glass. The material however is flexible and durable so no fear of rips of damaged product!
0,Love this knife!  It's very sharp and is perfect for cutting meat and bread.
0,I decided to try the Snapware brand because it was one of the most highly rated and recommended of all the storage container brands out there. As usual, coming from Amazon.com, this piece arrived promptly and is exactly as described. I would definitely recommend this brand to anyone.
0,My previous iron was a Black and Decker, and although it was only a few years old and was still performing well, I decided to give this upgraded model a try. I am the ironer of the house, so I get to choose my own tools. This is my first experience with a stainless steel sole plate, and I like it. It glides smoothly over all fabrics. The one thing Ive never liked about ceramic sole plates is their tendency to get caked with melted reside. Removing it usually compromised the non-stick coating. 		There is a lot to like about this iron: the aforementioned larger sole plate; the digital readout; ample steam; extra-long cord; and automatic shutoff, just to name a few. (My wife just texted me to let me know that I hadnt turned off the iron when I left the house; I replied that it has auto shutoff but the red light stays on as long as its plugged in.) I used it to iron a load of shirts and pants, and I was impressed. I especially like the ease of temperature adjustment. With just a few button-presses I can change from the cotton setting to the acrylic setting, something I never bothered with on previous non-digital models. (Id just set it toward the cotton end and hope I didn't melt anything.)		I cant say that I love ironing, but I do love the resultsand this iron.
0,I love that this has the easy clean trays and there aren't really edges to catch crumbs not landing on the trays. It's so much easier to pick it up and clean under it, than it was to pick up and try to shake out our old toaster. For a family of 6, the 4 slots are a must. This is a good affordable fit.
0,Awesome. Heavy material good quality and great price. Usually you only get one panel. That's the curtain conspiracy. On the picture they are all "oh look how pretty they look and there's two of em so it must come in twos right?" WRONG. These come in twos tho. Good job curtain peeps, way to be logical. Anyway, super great quality and they look awesome. I like that it came with the shiny ropes too.
0,Wow, what a bargain! When I think back how we struggled with a standard, old fashioned tool, we were very lucky it broke.
0,No need to buy one of the pricey ones - this does the trick and looks very nice. I put some foam pads on the back rail so that if it's up against a wall it won't scuff.
0,Works Great!
0,Awesome
0,as expected
0,I love these sheets! When I was looking for sheets for my 17 inch tall mattress with an additional 2 inch mattress topper, I wasn't finding what I needed, until now. These sheets fit my tall mattress, with lots of 'tuck in' room underneath. The color is deep and beautiful, and the sheet stays put! The pillowcases are stitched with a beautiful edge. Very nice!
0,I love this frame.  It's for an 8 x 10 picture but is a wide frame, so it's much bigger.  Very pretty.
0,Great and durable. Good looks and function. Good heat distribution. Worth the price
0,I purchased these for my fiance and I to use next year at our wedding in the Dominican Repubilc!  Can't wait to see people's expressions as we toast with our new coolies!  They're awesome!
0,Very good clips, good quality	They do the job.
0,great guest bed
0,i love my heated blanket. it isn't too hot but it warms up fast. great product!!
0,Great quality
0,I ordered three of these rugs with my fingers crossed. I figured they would be ok for the price. I am absolutely thrilled with them. They are soft, each one is individual and they don't smell at all. I looked at similar ones for much more money. Don't go anywhere else, these are perfect!
0,Beautiful, comfortable and a perfect fit!!
0,Beautiful and great value!		They needed about two days to air out, however - not because of any kind of chemical smell (there was none) but because these sure smelled like flowers! I guess they are made out of hyacinths, so there you go. The smell, however, is now completely gone.		These are very nice baskets and a total steal!
0,Sturdy, functionaly
0,Works well for the day to day small vacuuming tasks - keep in mind this is not a full blown vacuum. But it does a great job to take on all the small bits.	Also mind the fact that the filter you see inside needs to be changed every once in a while - Amazon has replacement - not a big deal but it's good to know.
0,just what we were looking for............gave as gifts, too!!!!!
0,The perfect size for the perfect margarita
0,Nice. Just what I expected. Good value for money.
0,My 12 year old daughter says she has to coolest lunch box at middle school.  High quality, great zipper with lots of room.
1,These (at least mine) leak, rendering them completely useless unless you're somehow pale to keep them with the top facing up at all times in your bag or something.  I expect a refund... I'm wondering how it has gotten such good reviews?  I guess it's possible I got a "lemon," but just looking at how they're built and the lack of a real seal leads me to believe that they would all leak... I think this would hold sunscreen (and not leak), but it won't hold liquid of any kind!
1,Not that anything was wrong with it, but the color was not as I thought looking at the picture.	Returned it for a refund
1,I bought this for my destination wedding, and it ripped as soon as I took it out of the box. I can't use it.
1,Rarely used, took on one trip.  Just tried to turn it on and it is broken.  It worked great while it worked, hence the 2 stars.
1,First one arrived bent. Amazon is great and shipped the replacement out right away. Well...it arrived bent also. Love the T Fal pots and pans...this one just may be too big. I ended up bending it back in shape with my bare hands so that the lid would fit.
1,cheap tacky quality
1,Blue, but not Dark Navy
1,I wanted a set of measuring spoons and I got these useless spoons.  It's the one time I didn't read reviews because what the hell they are just measuring spoons.  Who the heck measures a pinch or a tad..,,I want my money back!
1,Smells SO bad, even after I washed the pieces and left them outside to air out for weeks. Went directly into the trash
1,It's cute
1,Manufacture taped down 'hands' on clock.  When I took take off it peeling the paint off.  Cheap Chinese crap.
1,Buyer beware. I received my cross and it was merely 5 1/2 inches high. it is advertised as 10"! Amazon does not cover return postage which is 50% of purchase price.  So no return option here. Color tone on the metal is also different from advertised. not silver tone but rarher golden. not sure if the wood is authentic. nice looking cross though.
1,These are terrible! Do not waste your money on them. Spend a bit more and get higher quality pot holders. Very sorry I bought this.
1,Lids and handles are flimsy but get the job done.
1,Disappointed in the shapes. Even though they came each wrapped in plastic inside their own box, 2 of the 4 shapes were bent and lopsided when they arrived. Bending them back didn't help for keeping the bottom edges flush with the pan to hold the eggs in during cooking. They seem too lightweight to do the job right, eggs always leak out the back of each shape where the handles attach, and the area (especially the star) is bit small for a Grade A large egg - fried eggs turn out very thick. But my 2-year-old does love requesting the flower and heart shapes!
1,I received my king size blanket.  It's super soft but not as shown on the picture.  I purchase the plain "coffee colored" blanket, but what I receive is a coffee colored blanket with flowers on them.  I will be returning my blanket asap.  I'll give it two stars for the softness.
1,Very flimsy.
1,Was so jazzed to get these for my cast-iron Pots. But you can't leave them on while cooking, the heat from side of Pots goes into the sleeves and burns the inside, such a stench. I sadly assumed since they were fitted sleeves they could stay on.	Its very hard to push these onto a already hot handle everytime I want to stir or move Pots.
1,I liked this product until the second time I used it and it broke. I mainly bought it to cut red onion using the dicing size blade and figured it would be able to withstand that but I was wrong.
1,We are generally big fans of Oxo products.  They usually do a good job of engineering, but not on the Expandable Drawer Dividers.  Our "spring loaded" version of another brand went into place and have stayed there for five years.  The Oxo brand keeps coming loose.  Whatever the press-down, lock-in tab does, it doesn't hold, so the dividers need to be reset occasionally.		If I had to bet money on which version was better, before seeing either of them, I would have gone with Oxo.  The real world verdict is the spring loaded version, for us.
1,This is a poor quality tension rod that would not stay on my wall. I followed the instructions, however, both ends popped off exposing the tension spring inside. Target has better tension rods for cheaper. Don't waste your time or money on this!
1,The measuring *spoons* are OK. The cups rust. Stainless isn't supposed to rust. Not good stainless anyway.
1,I bought the cream color duvet cover set. I didn't like the color at all. On top of that, it developed pilling after 1 wash. I used the top load with cold water and dedicates, but still it developed pilling after 1 wash.
1,Bought it for a fundraiser, went to use it and it had a hole in it.
1,I hate these sheets. I wish I could return them. They fall all over you like liquid and suffocate you in your sleep. Can't use these...
1,I didn't like it, in the picture looks good but when i receive it it look poor and transparent. Dont re ommend.
1,Very poor quality!  The insert in the door is just flimsy cardboard.  Works great if you don't use it much.  The top is not waterproof or anything, it is just mdf like the rest
1,this was the perfect water bottle for my kids until the two pieces of it separated, it happened to both bottles.  very disappointed.
1,At first loved them, very soft and then noticed the color actually yellowed from the sun and could not wash out! Would not purchase again!
1,Well,I ordered these after loving 2 others but these came with the wax cracked and a piece broken off. Not sure I like them now.
1,Had a fishy smell in the fridge after some water from defrosted seafood spilled on one of the trays. Emptied and cleaned the fridge and its contents but it would not go away. Decided to try this bag after reading the good reviews and there's been no change whatsoever. Went back to some good ol baking soda and that did the trick. Would not try again.
1,I  It cooked rice just great!  But then, last week of November, it quits.  Just quits.  Would never buy again!
1,terrible. Can't hold the wight of jeans. 2 already broke within 5 days of purchase
1,My only reason for not returning this is the difficulty in doing so.  The only option the company gives me is to take it to the nearest UPS shipping store which for me is an island and a 20 minute flight away. Thanks for that by the way.  Fed ex is right down the road.  Anyway, this item showed up scratched across the entire top and the planks on top had huge bubbles underneath them.  The frustrating thing is that this is so noticeable that who ever shipped it had to have known but just shipped it to me anyway.  It is sad that there are people that work for a company and could care less about the product its customers are receiving.  So now I am stuck with the crappy product which will become another DIY project in order to make it look decent enough to use.
1,See through and thin. Needs more paint, looks insubstantial.
1,I make lots of soups and got this to chop vegetables.	I wanted something that will really chop vegetables into uniform sizes. This doesnt really "chop" vegetables though.		For an onion it minced half of it and the other half was still in big chunks. So I had more of an onion paste with big unchopped onion chunks in it.	It was the same result for celery.	It didn't chop carrots at all, just had big cut marks in it. I had to still do those by hand.		Also its a bit small. 1 big onion fills it up. Returning mine to get something bigger and more precise.
1,The picture makes it look like the entire candle will glow the full amount, but in reality, the upper half is brighter than the lower half.  I have smaller sized flameless Inglow candles where the entire candle glows (and they look GREAT!), but this size (4x6) does not happen that way.  It's much darker in the lower half.		Also, when I opened up my delivery, one of the three 4x6 candles I bought was already turned on! I'm assuming it was bad packaging from whom I bought it from because, again, I didn't have this problem from the smaller flameless Inglow candles I purchased in a different order.		On a positive note, I do like how these candles are on a timer.  No remote is needed, as they turn on by themselves consistently.
1,cannot put together - even with 2 people.  have had over a week, tried multiple times - the cam locks do not hold and now the holes for the bolts are not fitting.
1,It does work well, the room air seems cleaner and fresher but the unit is very loud, I was unable to get used to it in 2 weeks at the low setting due to a low thrumming and vibrating sound, at medium speed the vibration lessens quite a bit if the unit is placed upon a towel while it is on the dresser.	It is definately NOT quiet at all, on loud settings I can actually hear it from downstairs with the bedroom closed and I doubt that anyone with decent hearing could sleep with that much noise.	I usually put it on high when I am not home and then I put it on medium while I am sleeping.	I quit using the ionizing feature as I feel it made the room smell odd.	I would not purchase this again, I would purchase a higher quality more expensive one.	Not sure if I can still return this after 3 months but if I can I certainly will as it is making more and more noises as time passes.
1,Just to clarify, I ordered these needing the small sphere bulbs and I received only small plain LEDs. Beyond this the battery packs and electronics are incredibly cheap. The switch, as other customers have noted, is very touchy and we'll switch back and forth between flashing and solid or it will go off all together. Also the electronics are very cheap and the soldering is crappy and there are frayed wires. I was actually afraid I was going to damage the wiring just inserting the batteries. These seem cheap but you can get good quality ones at Target or Home Depot for a dollar or two more which are excellent quality
1,It is cheap in price and cheaply made. Mine did not work out of the box but I'd prolly look for a better one if I get another. Returning it.
1,Didn't work.  Ended up in the trash.
1,Every little thing was wonderful until the measurements and writing disappeared.  with just regular washing up, the white writing has completely disappeared  I bought three of these as I cook a lot and they are my favorite type of liquid measure.  Waste of money. Will not buy again.
1,These flour sack towels do not wipe the water off the dishes with one swipe.
1,you just get one, it's not a set
1,This fringe reminded me of the material audio tapes are made out of. It was too long for the doorway, so we had to cut some off the bottom. There was no easy way to hang it up either. We ended up using duct tape to keep it from being pulled down. It didn't hold up well at all with children going in and out of it. The strands broke off easily. By the end of a couple of hours it had been torn down once, and half of the fringe ended up on the floor and in the trash. Static electricity kept it from being thrown away easily too, because it would cling to your hand. It was in such bad shape when we were done with it that we decided just to toss it instead of trying to salvage it for another year.
1,Over the standing shower wall, the top shelf is well above my eye level. I'm basically having to reach over my head to get whatever is in there. The lower shelf doesn't provide enough clearance for any kind of pump bottles so really, kinda terrible spacing all around.		I used a dremel and a metal blade to basically saw off that useless top shelf. Now it's no longer blocking the lower shelf and it's at least usable.
1,Poor quality.  Only 2 tools were in the package, not 4.  The larger of the tools was chipped and metal flakes off. Can't be used on food grade products with chipping metal.
1,The product is a nightmare, makes an unbearable noise at night, impossible to sleep, does not cool enough, the hose for the water outlet is very short and you need a large base to deposit the water, in short is a total disaster, this product Does not justify its price.
1,Bought this product and it fell apart during construction.  the welds broke right off.  it is super flimsy aluminum and the screw holes don't line up properly.  i've built a lot of furniture in my day and this was walmart piece of junk.  it's worth about 30 bucks.  well, since mine broke apart, it isn't worth anything.  sent it back immediately.
1,A few days ago I bought a Trudeau 24 ounce Hydration Bottle on sale at a local store. Like others, I was very impressed with its design concept. I liked the double insulation and the soft straw. However, I was concerned about the very large percentage of users who experienced problems with breakage of the plastic.		There are many types of plastics available to hydration bottle manufacturers. Trudeau designed an excellent bottle but built it with very cheap plastic. There is no reason that a plastic bottle shouldn't withstand extreme abuse without breaking and be dishwasher safe.		The Trudeau can be damaged by just tipping it over or dropping it a few inches. It is not dishwasher safe and must be hand washed. When I looked at my brand new Trudeau, I noticed that the bottom was already cracked and shattered.		I thus started investigating alternatives. I went to REI which specializes in recreation equipment and has many brands of plastic hydration bottles. I looked for a bottle of similar design concepts to Trudeau. I found one. It is the CamelBak Insulated Better Bottle.		The Camelbak also has a built-in straw and is sold both double and single wall in many sizes. It is made of Eastman Tritan(tm) copolyester. The bottle is completely BPA-free and is dishwasher safe. Tritan copolyester provides excellent impact resistance and is suitable for both warm and cold beverages.		To quote from the description "CamelBak Big Bite valve eliminates awkward drips and spills; just bite and sip and the beverage flows through the valve--you don't even need to tip the bottle to drink. But if lifting and tipping is your preferred method, no problem; just remove the straw inside. Big Bite valve has an articulating stem, so when not in use it folds down next to the bottle and stays clean".		Sound great so far but are there drawbacks to the CamelBak design? Yes, one. The straw is unusual and takes some getting used too. Unlike the open straw of the Trudeau, CamelBak created a straw more like a nipple. The advantage of the CamelBak straw is that it won't spill if tipped even with the straw in its open position? You have to bit down on the straw and suck. Something many of us haven't done since we were babies. Biting and sucking is a learned experience. Some users may find that biting and sucking is too much trouble. No problem. If you don't like the nipple you can remove it. You can also remove the straw and drink out of the bottle by tipping it and drinking from it like a conventional bottle.		Possibly because the bottle is unusual, REI decided to discontinue selling it and it is thus being sold on clearance at a big discount(12/05/11). If you miss this clearance sale, you can buy it at Amazon at a slightly higher price. The reviews on Amazon are excellent.		<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Camelbak-Better-Insulated-Bottle/dp/B0043838WM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Camelbak Better Insulated Bottle</a>		As I said above, the CamelBak is available in many sizes and both insulated and standard. I choose the 20 ounce insulated and the 25 ounce standard bottle. Why? They will both fit in the same size slot: 3-1/8" (79 mm). The standard bottle is shorter, holds an extra 5 ounces, and is cheaper. It is fine for room temperature drinking water. I will use the insulated bottle for liquids that I wish to keep cold like iced tea, iced coffee, lemonade, etc.
1,Had this for 13 days and the lid already broke. Will be returning.
1,Hard to clean and does not chop very well.  It is not near the quality of pampered chef.  You get what you pay for.  I should have paid the higher amount and bought another pampered chef chopper.
1,I bought this toaster for my mom. She only used a few times a month and it quit working after about 6 months. What a complete waste of my money. I can't believe a product from Black &a Decker would be such garbage. DO NOT BUY!
1,Cheaply made, tiny, disappointed with this completely. Not even rustic looking markings on the top. Looks like someone made them with a sharpie. Totally not worth $54.
1,It's a lovely can opener and worked well the first time I used it. I have owned it 3 weeks, only used it a few times, and took good care of it, not running it through a dishwasher, just rinsing and wiping and air drying, but it has rusted to the point that it is unusable. Luckily I am within the return window.
1,Rusts super quick even when you dry it. Don't waste your money.
1,This thing pretty much looked like a piece of junk in my opinion. When I moved out of my apartment, I just threw it out. Couldn't get the leaves to sit down right. I mean, I guess that's what you get for a fake tree.
1,WABBLELY  :(  I STILL USE IT JUST DONT move it ..
1,This machine is a piece of junk. The top doesn't stay on when shredding cheese. The last time I tried to use it I couldn't get it to start, because I couldn't push the buttons. It now resides in our local land fill.
1,One day it works, the next day it does not, then the following day it's back to working.  Maybe it's user error but I am struggling with getting this to go on and off when I need it to.
1,This was absolutely horrible to install. Followed the directions that weren't clear to begin with. I had to adjust so now I have large holes underneath the piece that goes into the wall. I had to use nails to get it to stay in place. HORRIBLE.
1,Pan is too HUGE... I got it as a gift for my daughter. It was too big for their range so they had to return it. BUYER BEWARE! Vendor would not offer any return shipping and treated her poorly.
1,This filter does not stand up to time. We loved it initially, now the replacement filters are as expensive as buying a new unit entirely! That makes no financial sense unless You're rich and don't respect your money. Water quality is awesome, don't get me wrong but the filtration rate is horrible that it's at a trickle every minute. Don't expect to serve your family immediately. I would never buy this product again.
1,I bought this blender earlier in the year. It worked fine for a while . Now I have to insert my spoon to get it to start blending. Very, very disappointing. I wanted a glass blender to make soups , this one cannot even crush anything without help.
1,Do not buy this is soo damn tiny I'm pissed I waited a month for nothing
1,After uisng it only twice the rubber bumpers on the front and rear came off.
1,These are cheap pieces of equipment that wear out after a few hundred bottles of seltzer production. Between the cheap rubber seat at the CO2 bottle head , and the touted 1/4 turn bottle lock, it a race to see what wears out first. I've just gone through my second unit and I'm done.
1,To be honest I wasn't to happy with these, simply because the wood had patches on it and they were all splintering very bad.  Maybe I just got a bad batch?  Regardless, I will not purchase this item again.
1,this frame is NOT 8x10
1,Arrived with big scratches on the outside top of 3 of the cups out of 6. Since it seems to scratch easily, would not recommend this cups. The design is pretty I have to say, therefore the 2 stars.
1,Not as great as it's made out to be - clumsy, bending while cutting, awkward.
1,When new these pans were great. The handles stayed cool, the surface was even, it heated evenly, and it was marvelously easy and quick to clean. Fast forward 2 years, not so much. It's gone from non stick to full stick, the coating is chipping at the edges, and the handles are coming loose. The pans also dome slightly in the middle, even under low heat, so ingredients like olive oil added before other ingredients tend to flow to a ring around the bottom sides.. I scrupulously followed the use instructions including never using spray oil, but all the pans I have deteriorated the same way. Expensive compared to competitors, and didn't last as long as my T-Fal Teflon pans they replaced. The handles still don't transmit heat, so there's that.
1,Let me first say, I shop a lot on reviews and frequent Amazon often, so I feel the need to be honest with everyone so you don't get burned as I have!		Out if the bag - sheets are very thin and felt very scratchy and cheap feeling.		After first washing - still very scratchy, but figured they had to be worn in to soften up (after some more washes)		I've had this for about a month now and instead, this thin, scratchy fabric started to pill!!! I've never had a sheet set do that - at least not nearly this quickly!		Horrible waste of money, very disappointed. This is one of the first purchases I've made on Amazon I truly regret.		I've bought new sheets to replace this mistake. What a shame.
1,I received these in the mail remembering what a great deal I thought I got on these. You get what you pay for...they were an off color that didn't match all the other oil rubbed bronze hardware in my bathroom. They got returned immediately.
1,Came with holes. Was worthless and returned it.
1,They seemed a little thin when I got them; I wondered how long they would last. First one cracked within two weeks. Don't buy, not worth it.
1,Doesn't look great in person
1,This shower curtain looks super cute online. However, it does not even fit the standard shower curtain size. Two sizes too small for an standard shower!
1,One of the two arrived with a cracked front sheet of plastic.
1,I did not like this tablecoth.  It looked fine on the table but was very thin and did not work to keep wettness off my wood table I was trying to protect.  It was like a lace cloth with open areas so it did not work for my objective.
1,the print is so dark - bought as a Mother's Day gift - we have a Boston and she's "Grandma's" best buddy - will re-think buying any more towels from Lantern Press.  Packaging was fine.
1,Worthless!!
1,The zipper broke the first use!
1,Despite already having a Bissell PowerEdge Hard Floor Vacuum, I thought this might be a good idea to pick up.  Cordless, built-in hand vac, and moving brushes all seemed like a worthwhile reason to spend a bit more.  Well, it wasn't.  Comparing the two, the PowerEdge handled things far better than the more expensive Life-Off.  One pass across a patch of spilled kitty liter with the PowerEdge and it was gone, while the Life-Off took 4 or more passes.  The PowerEdge also was better at picking up larger objects such as cat food, paperclips, peas, and various other things that hit the floor.  Oh yeah, and, the Lift-off doesn't have anything to get into the edges like the PowerEdge does.  The one thing that I can really praise the Lift-Off for is easy movement in the swiveling head.  It's nowhere near as stiff as the PowerEdge, making control easier.
1,cheap plastic, way over priced.
1,Lame
1,We've had these for about 4 months now.  One broke tonight.  Not a big deal but disappointing. The outer layer cracked and the water has gotten in between the walls.  Our major complaint is that whatever this plastic is it seems to attract spots, moreso than our other plastic drinkware.		Amazon's page clearly says they're dishwasher safe as does the packaging they arrived in so we do put them in the dishwasher.  Might be ok if you want to handwash your plastic glasses but I have no intention of doing so and we chose these based on the fact that we could put them in the dishwasher.		They are a great size, holds ice as well as an entire can of pop.  I wouldnt buy them again though. I have another double walled plastic glass from a different manufacturer that is 12 years old and goes in the dishwasher as well.  Admittedly, that one was much more expensive than these but 12 years is worth it!!		These would probably be cool for summer parties if you don't expect them to last more than one season.
1,Not happy at all with this item. Its difficult to attach the lid and they are definitely not durable at all. I noticed after my first use that one of the lids completely cracked, an entire edge literally broke off. Very disappointed in this product and on amazon for allowing such item to sell on their site.
1,Terribly underpowered; it will barely whip cream. Expensive, too! I've had cheap no-name hand mixers for $10 that were twice as powerful as this piece of junk at one-fourth the price. KitchenAid appears to be riding on its reputation, at this point, or they think that because the stand mixer is a great product (which it is), you'll assume all their products are. Do not buy.
1,Not as nice a material as the others I purchased.  i do not care for the cheap, thin material.
1,I buy this to replace a lost OXO Good Grips Kitchen & Herb Scissors.		this Kitchenaid is 4 stars for the price.	However, it is not that great. It has some flaws.	The handles are two small. you can/t comfortably put three fingers in it.	The blades are screwed together. not sure how long it will last and impossible to clean.	If I gave the OXO a 5 star, this one would be 2.
1,too thin for the price, this is very similar to the cheap liners that are included with shower curtains
1,Put it away.  Just didn't work for me.
1,I am really getting disgusted with so many new products. Mr. Coffee always made a reasonably priced alternative to jacked up prices on other coffee makers - and the coffee was always good. BUT this model is very disappointing. The hot water seems to only wet the grounds in one corner and if we don't pour the liquid through the grounds over and over, we get water that is coffee flavored - but not good coffee. Light brown - obviously the rest of the coffee is not being touched.		Bad design! How can this be? I doubt if we will keep this machine unless everyone is prepared to keep pouring coffee back in the grounds over and over.
1,works as  advertised, very quit on low setting. You can't hear it at  all.	Takes  some  effort to  clean but that is  expected for this  type of  product.		Update.  I both this  Nov 26 2013.  I have not used  it most of this  year up until now and  it will not  work. For the price it should last more than  2 years ( and  not  continuous use )
1,Serious off-gassing!!! ugh!  Not as pretty as I'd hoped it might be - but will do the job for the meantime.
1,Kinda cheap looking. Better in picture
1,Cheap. Didn't work for me.
1,I thought I would be putting this in our master bath at this price point.  Wow...no thanks.  The build quality is something you would buy for your sophomore college student getting their first apartment.  This is not worth $100.		First, building it is a pain.  Its not easily customizable to each length of the shower and you will fumble and get frustrated with it trying to make it right.  Once you do get it in place, theres a pretty good chance it will fall off if you don't have a perfectly flat service.  We were going to put this in the guest bath but now Im worried it will fall onto our guests.  Were taking it down and will not be using it.  Keep looking  this isn't what you want.
1,"White and black  series" is what I noticed when I bought these covers, as they look like a good match to my Ikea cushion covers... but "white" was actually a dark burlap, and these completely clash with my other pillows.  Didn't bother sending back.
1,Fake. I've been using this lemon lavender scent forever! This one and the citrus sage. I've never gotten it in this form before (the vent clip) I was excited but had to throw it out the 2nd day. The fake smells were giving me a migraine. I suppose someone might not care and enjoy the scent anyway, but it is not refreshing citrus or florally lavender. I can't even describe what it actually smelled like cause it was just chaotic and poor quality. Nothing distinctive.
1,These molds are for tiny spoons. Unless you are making treats for Hobbits, in which case they would be perfect.
1,These are okay for protecting surfaces from hot pans, but little else. Much tougher to manipulate than cloth....too thick. They don't lift items off of oven shelves easily...too unwieldy. These don't open jars...not enough traction.
1,handle broke off first time I used it. can't apply a lot of pressure or it will break
1,What a nice product. Was a bit short for our Queen bed. Looks nothing like the photo. That's why I give it 2 stars. I found out through trial and error that it all depends on the manufacturer what type of bedding you actually get.
1,update- blanket stopped working and now I can't return it! Don't waste your money on this!
1,Nice idea, but doesn't work as designed. 9 times out of 10, a Q-Tip doesn't pop up through the hole. I have tried filling it up, leaving it half empty, and everything in between, but no luck. And unfortunately, not worth the cost to return it, so into the recycle bin it went.
1,Fell apart in 5 minutes of a wind storm
1,No handle to remove lid.  Difficult  to get lid to fit snugly.
1,From the reviews posted on the web site I expected more than I actually received. The love seat is really hard to get up from if you are a senior citizen. or you have a handicap of some kind.
1,Screen froze/broke after about 5 uses....
1,Of the two only one was good to go.  The other was slightly deformed and wouldn't close/seal properly.  Not the seller's fault, but a defect from the factory.		Edit: Nope, new one is now toast as well after a couple of cups.  Now a 1 star review.  Both seem to be melting from the heat of the Keurig (you'd think they would be designed for that).  Hate to say it, but wondering if it's some kind of knock off.  Will be asking for a refund of the products.
1,Not what we expected
1,COMPLETELY WORTHLESS. WILL BE LUCKY TO GET IT TO WORK FOR TWO WEEKS. VERY CHEAL MATERIALS AND COMPONENTS.
1,Looked great, but spring-action probe opening mechanism (which turns it on automatically) kept popping open 100% of the time.  Poor design, lousy execution. Do NOT recommend.
1,sent it back.... was for work,
1,As I am quite up in years, I thought that this would be a life saver.  However, it works on only a few jars!  I use Clasico Spaghetti sauce - will not work on these jars.  This only has worked on a very small number of jars that I use.  Don't waste your money.
1,It is a great concept but after a few fills something happens and you'll get a stream of oil instead of a nice spray you get when first filled. We use very clean extra virgin bertolli olive oil. Taken apart and cleaned the nozzle with compressed air and the problem repeats. We had two units we bought a year before this one when the Calphalon people told us to not use spray oil (Pam) due to the propellant reacting with the heat. Both exhibited the clog problem so we bought two more thinking it was a bad batch ... but no luck.
1,Kid rusted from condensation in a matter of hours. Pots ok still
1,Does not come with screws.
1,It's dangerous can't use it
1,My first one broke after six months and my second broke after 4 days.
1,This thing seems to go by many names.  I think to keep you from seeing bad reviews.  This is one of those gifts you get that looks like a much better idea than it is. First off, the pan is a non standard size. Most brownie direction base timing on the size of the pan. Next there is the BP like oil spill you get from all the cooking spray you have to coat this thing in. I don't know many people who actually like the taste of cooking spray and with the pools of oil that are created by coating every surface you will taste it. Now the biggest problem with the pan, the bottom of the pan has a hole, a metal panel sits in that. The panel isn't perfectly flat so there is a gap between at least 1 corner and the pan. The weight of the batter isn't enough to press the panel down. I thought the fact that you heat the pan first maybe as you pour the batter it would cook the outside layer and seal the pan, NOPE! That's why the directions suggest you should put foil under the pan, basically to catch the large amount of batter that will be leaking out. Removing the brownies was fairly easy. Yes you'll get perfectly square brownies, but they won't be the same thickness due to leakage. All this to make cutting brownies easier. Was this ever really a problem in the brownie making process?
1,Despite claiming to be rust free, it rusted in less than three months. Since amazon has stated that they can't do refunds or replacements after 30 days, it makes this purchase a total loss!
1,Bought this last summer.  It's been run a lot.  Does a good job.  Very quiet.
1,Super cheap material
1,Alton Brown warns us against uni-taskers -- he is correct .  This thing must be temperamental -- I can't get it to make golden brown and delicious quesadillas with ANY fillings -- they just ooze out, and yes I've spread everything our evenly, and yes it was small amounts.  It's annoying.  I want to stop using my pans because it's messy, but this thing just is not doing it for me.
1,I would say this falls into the category of you get what you pay for.  I now know the difference between a cheap set of glasses and a quality set.  The bowl of the glass seems like it is going to fall off the stem at any moment.  In one of them you can actually see a small hole through the middle of the stem.
1,For the price, I wasn't expecting anything that great but it is pretty much worthless.  "Insulation" is silver foil on the inside which doesn't do anything.  And the colors are nothing like the photo - they are very dull and dreary.
1,Didn't even want to give this one star.  It is totally worthless, and perhaps could be dangerous.  Website info did not say you can't use on an electric stove. . . info was on the box.  While this didn't affect me because I have a gas range, it seemed to be an indicator of the type of company this is.  Tried this thing twice as directed, but neither time did it work as stated.  Second time I took food off an finished in another pan.	The info on this thing says it is iron.  There is no way there is any iron on this.  Just thin metal.	It seems it could be dangerous because as I attempted to use it, the electronic ignition on my range kept "clicking" indicating it was trying to light.  Subsequently I "smelled" the gas tracer and turned it off!  Should have returned it but it enabled me to get my other item with no shipping charges, so I guess I paid for the shipping after all.	Think twice when considering this product.  It's cheap, but not worth what you're paying for it.
1,Yuck, these smell horrible, I had to throw them out.
1,Total garbage. Sponge holder began to rust within 2 months of ownership. Don't buy
1,I chose these cloths because the edges are hemmed instead of serged, which I've found in the past tends to last longer without fraying. However, the quality on these is very poor. The thin and loose terry cloth tends to unravel and the edges are also coming un-sewed after just one wash. I purchased them to use as cleaning cloths, and they'll do fine for that purpose, but they don't seem like they will last very long.
1,Update - 04/15/13	I've had this thing a bit more than year now, used it once a week to slice loaves of homemade bread.  I had originally reported that it got a bit warm.  A few months after that, there was the occasional smell of burnt wiring, but it still worked.  Then the burning smell became more noticeable and more often.  Last week, tried to cut a small piece of cooked (and tender) roast.  The knife really struggled through it, and quickly started smoking again.  Used it this morning, and smelled smoke, but it still cuts - just a little slower now.  This thing is on its final legs.  I really liked the ergonomics of the knife, but the fact that this relatively expensive knife lasted through about 60 loaves of bread is inexcusable.  Maybe I can make something worthwhile out of the otherwise useless wooden stand in my wood shop. At least the knife was BPA free.		Original review:	Bought this thing as a bread slicer.  Don't really care about slicing meats, prefer a sharp knife for that.  If you have a bread machine, you need one of these.  Cuts thin slices and doesn't destroy the bread while doing it.  Knife get a little warm after slicing a loaf, but it works great.
1,Flimsy, the handles were broken off when it arrived.
1,Purchased this item from Amazon Fullfillment Center 9 months ago. All of the sudden the lid stopped working just like all of the reviews said. UGH, can't believe I still purchased this! I have replaced batteries, called customer service. It is so difficult to return a piece of garbage after 30 days of purchase. This item is the garbage that it is supposed to be containing. I thought this was the perfect item for our needs but the product just doesn't last. The battery containment is very thin plastic. Very cheap feel to the light weight item. The stickers on the outside of the bin are a nice touch but that's not where people are looking when tossing something in. The motor is loud. The rings are difficult to take in and out each time. Smell is not locked out with this. If liquid comes through your garbage bag, it leaks on the floor. The containers are NOT liquid tight.
1,I bought this clock in 2012 to replace another atomic weather station. On the other brand, the remote temp sensor failed and it was cheaper to  buy this clock than to buy another sensor.		The good:	The temperature inside and outside is accurate		The bad:	The batteries, although relatively long lasting, do not last nearly as long as my other weather station. I change batteries on this unit about every 3-4 months. The other weather station was about 1 time per year.		The really bad:	Randomly, the weather station will display an inaccurate time and date. For instance, It says it is 8/11/2013 (it's actually May 2, 2014) and shows my time as Eastern (correct), but 1 hour behind. Also, for some reason, it really likes the month of August, because when the date goes wrong, it usually incorrectly displays August.  I manually set the time 3 days ago - after another incident, and woke up this morning to the wrong date again.		The incorrect date/time has happened sporadically since 2012, but it is getting worse. Although I've replaced the batteries, manually set the clock, put the station in our basement so that it can't receive the date/time signal,it continues to happen.		I will buy a sensor for my La Crosse weather station and throw this one away.
1,I loved the texture, but this mat was almost impossible to keep clean and pink mold developed under the suction cups.
1,I am not happy with this purchase The Turkish coffee maker just stop working after the insurance time was finished. I am sitting now with a white elephant.
1,no tubes so you can't vac ceilings or moldings without  a ladder or getting on the floor
1,BOTH of these Per'Fect Egg Timers are wildly inaccurate and thus useless for gauging egg doneness. I loved my previous Per'Fect Egg Timer branded under WS, which looks exactly the same, and we used weekly for over a year until lost. That one darkened to a fairly precise dark ring (from outside in) as the egg cooked, and you could distinctly read the progress on the 'soft, medium, hard' scale. These two egg timers darken with a vague, indistinguishable color bleed making a read on the 'soft, medium, hard' scale IMPOSSIBLE. I've even tried both timers at once to see if one is better, but both are consistently muddy. Hope we can locate the WS version that was lost, because these are junk.
1,I don't know why this color is $10 more than all others but it's very strange. Won't buy again
1,Why are so many appliances made for the U.S. market just plain ugly?		I needed an exhaust fan for my city apartment kitchen, and the black Bionaire was the only one I could find -- despite its conspicuous control panel -- that might be visually inoffensive. When it arrived, I discovered that it is in fact a dark "bronze" (a plus, actually, since my cheap landlord window frames are "bronze"), but the real shocker was that the fan blades are cobalt blue.  BLUE.  I know, I know.  Parts of the image shown in the Amazon picture are blue, but I had assumed that the color had been added to the image simply to highlight the design of the fan.  It may work well, but I refuse to look at it.
1,It appears to be accurate, who knows I don't have another scale to compare it to. However, it does not keep a charge for long. Or shall I say the batteries are depleted within days. Yes days. Not weeks or months. I can't afford to keep feeding this thing batteries. It is being returned.
1,Colors are pretty but the ink runs out way to quickly. I got these in the mail this morning and have only colord 3 pages of a coloring book and a handful of them are already empty. Very dissapointed.
1,Slippery
1,Piece of junk.  Worked for a short time then just quit.  Had an electrician friend take it apart and he said to throw it away it was not worth fixing.  Cheap components that burn out quickly.		you pay what you get
1,toothbrush holder fell off wall twice sticky strip not strong enough on my freshly painted walls toothpaste dispenser is staying up so far but it didn't cost a lot so get what you pay for
1,The color din't work for me.
1,Flimsy but i guess it works... not worth what you pay.  I'd expect to pay a dollar for this at the dollar store.
1,FIRST TIME I USED IT, fine.  Steam does get up dirt.  but!  Long 'handle' that clips together is very wobbly, like legos.. very annoying;  the flip up clamps for the towel broke on day two.  One side worked alright, but I couldn't attach the other side,  I guess I could with large rubber bands.  I liked the idea of have several gallons  "on board" but the steam pours out of the attachment point of the 'hose' and the base...all annoying.  I'm going to go back and get a all in one unit if I can find one that doesn't have this horrible way of attaching a pad... very annoying.  Steam works. This machine?  Must have been designed by people who never clean floors.
1,doesn't stay on the mattress.
1,We had one of the older-style Felix wall clocks - with the rhinestone eyes - for over a decade with no problem. This one quit after less than a year - shoddy workmanship. Suggest buyers look at the Kit Kat clocks instead.
1,I'm not a fan of this pan, after using it a few times, it's now sitting in the back of my cabinet collecting dust. Cakes do not cool evenly in it and edges burn while center stays uncooked. Would not recommend
1,I never even got a chance to use this as it came with pieces broken off.  I'm sure some of this was delivery - the box was crushed in one corner and the internal padding bent.  But the fit and finish of this unit is poor, and the black plastic trim piece, while designed to make it very hip, actually was coming off when I opened the package.  Plus, the top of this thing is wavy, so it would make handling the bottle into its mouth difficult.  The three faucets were all bent over, and the catch basin has the same wavy and impractical design theme as the rest of the unit.  So, based on a visual inspection and a shipping mess, I give it one star.		NOTE:  I immediately got a call from the vendor to try to alleviate the problem, which was great.  I had already sent the unit back.  I want to repeat that MOST of this negative review comes from shipping issues - the unit was delivered upside down, with a crushed box, and obviously abused in shipping.  Pieces were broken off and made using the unit worrisome.  I didn't like the design once I saw it in my house, but that's a matter of taste.  But this review is not due to any problems using the unit, since I just repackaged it and shipped it back.
1,The claim "comes in a box that can be saved to store away the tree for next year" is a total joke! This is the box I received the item in, the *only* box. Absolutely not reusable, which was part of my motivation for choosing this tree. Be ready to have backup storage for it.
1,We actually gave it away, didn't seem to help with our body soreness.
1,Not happy with this at all. It just doesn't brew coffee that well. I have a Keurig K55 that's my main coffee maker at home I purchased this machine to take to work. There are coffees that I make at home in my Keurig K55 that come out tasting great rich full bodied. When I take a k cup to work and make that some coffee in this thing it comes out tasting awful. I'm amazed at how some of these coffees taste totally different out of this brewer weak and full of acid when at home it's perfect. I use a measuring cup with exactly 8oz of water which is the size I make in my machine at home so I know it's not me adding too much or to little water. It's now become a hot water maker for when I want tea.
1,This thing was bigger than my newborn.  I just don't understand why a 1/4 cup would ever need to be that big
1,I wanted to love this vacuum and I had high hopes for it. It is the most expensive vacuum I have ever purchased. I had heard a lot about it and saw many commercials that impressed me.		I bought the DC 41 because I have a Golden Retriever who sheds a lot. Since it was called "The Animal" and has a special attachment for pet hair, I thought my clean-up troubles were over. Frankly, the pet hair attachment is useless. I tried and tried for a long time to sweep up my dog's hair from the car upholstery and it did no good at all, it just pushed the hair around. I have never had this problem with other attachments on prior vacuums- at least they would vacuum up some of the hair. This attachment does not work.		As an upright vacuum, I have found the DC 41 to do a very good job on my nylon wall to wall carpets. I still have to go over my wool area rug repeatedly to get up the dog hair, and it never gets it all, but it performs better than my last vacuum in that regard. It definitely has superior suction capabilities, as advertised.		With superior suction, I believe you need a bigger dust bin. The dust bin is not large enough and gets jammed up too easily with dog hair and dirt. The dirt gets stuck around the purple component inside the bin. I vacuum about 5 times a week, and I have to clean the bin more than once while vacuuming each time. I always have to dig the dirt out with my hands because of it getting stuck inside. This is not what I was anticipating at all from viewing the commercials- I understood that the dirt was supposed to drop out of the dust bin by itself when you push the discard button, which never happens. I do not want to have to touch the dirt with my hands! Why not have a mechanism that ejects the dirt and hair, rather than just a trap door? This seems to be a basic design flaw and makes me question whether this vacuum was ever tested with a long-haired pet.		The cord is positioned badly- it is always in the way as I work. It should be centered and high up, rather than midway and on the right, so that it is in an optimum neutral position whether you are right or left-handed, and so that it is out of the way. The engineers need to look at this again.		The ball is too big to fit under most furniture, and navigation with the ball takes a little getting used to, however, I believe it is a functional improvement and it provides superior navigation to a traditional vacuum.		When you are finished vacuuming and want to return the handle to the upright position, it never stays there the first time- the latch is finicky. You have to keep trying to get it to stay upright.		The DC41 only came with 2 tools besides the worthless pet hair tool, and it does not have a light, which I really miss. Using the attachments is awkward and inconvenient because the wand is inside the hose, so it does not bend. You have to remove the wand to use the attachments so that the hose will bend. I noticed this most often trying to do some higher dusting, such as on my window shades and lampshades.		Overall, I have not found this to be worth the big investment. It is a disappointment. I think some re-engineering is in order before I would consider purchasing a Dyson again. This is unfortunate because I have found their customer service to be top notch.
1,Leaks and sprays EVO all over.  I threw it away.
1,its been over 30. days that i paid for this item and i am still waiting for it to arrive!!!! maybe they still haven't invented this pan an i was just sold an idea! what ever the case may be, i am canceling my order rite after i post this review! "MAN" i really wanted to make some Crepes, guess i will just have too use my Toaster to make them!
1,This is nothing like I was expecting.  I was very disappointed.  I guess you get what you pay for.
1,This is my first 'good' pot set, and I spent more than I was comfortable with to get something that would last. After a few months of light-medium use, I have found it to be virtually impossible to prevent scratches on the exterior of the pots. The pans in particular (which I use much more often) are a complete mess on the bottom which contacts the metal elements on my stove.		This week I moved to a new place with a dishwasher and put my small pan through for the first time. It came out a complete disaster. The nice brushed surface is flaking off, or turning gold, or is streaked permanently. I was sure that these were dishwasher safe, and I checked double this amazon listing. Sure enough - "Bonded Dishwasher Safe 10-Piece Cookware Set"		Save your money, these are a waste. Get the full steel version.
1,If you like hard pillows this is for you...but if you want your head to sink in a bit skip this one.  It does work good to prop yourself up in bed to read or use your laptop.
1,Worked great....at first. The first few months it worked and then it could never find the docking station so I'd have to hunt for it every morning, pick it up and return it once I found it. Then, I could let it charge and charge but it'd only work for about 3 minutes and say it needed to charge and return to it's base. Very disappointed.
1,I basically wasted 10 bucks as it looks nothing like the pictures and smells funky. I tried but took it down right away as my eyes couldn't take it. I own two more of these with different designs and colors, this one will never be used.
1,Terrible coffee maker sent it back. Water doesn't get hot super bitter coffee
1,I ordered 2 of these sets. I used them for one night and one stopped working all together and one only blinks.
1,I slept one night on the Sabokawa pillow. It was hands-down the most comfortable pillow I had ever slept on.  However, by morning, I felt ill.		The next day, I removed a double layer of pillow cases and discovered something:  Having my nose anywhere near the pillow made me gag. Of course I had encountered some unpleasant VOC fumes and some other toxic smells.  But no fumes had ever made me gag before.		I liked the pillow so much that I aired it out in front of a fan for 7 or 8 weeks.  That didn't work.  I had purchased the pillow at BBBY, so naturally, the store was gracious in replacing it.  But, sadly, the replacement pillow is just as toxic.  I can smell and even taste the toxins.  I'm gagging all over again.		Back it goes.
1,This is the worst attachment.  The end does not fit any attachment on my hoover vacuum cleaner, I had to tape it on, then the clear plastic tubing kinks up and it is just awful.  I would not recommend this to anyone.
1,First day I had the fan, I turned it on, walked away and two minutes later it fell over and one of the blade's broke right off. I thought the fan had exploded!  The air flow was ok, but it needs to be securely attached to something or it will fall over.
1,Should have made them a bit narrower. Quality fine, But some "group" blew it by making them a bit too wide. I needed to put these in my top cabinet in my kitchen. However, they are about 1/2 inch too wide to let the cabinet door close. I think Stupid on their part. A half an inch should have been anticipated.
1,This cup is nice, as long as it is hand washed.  It cannot be left in water for any length of time because the chamber between the plastic and the stainless steel fills with water.  It is difficult to remove all the water when it gets in the chamber and, if it is not removed provides a steady drip of water over clean floors, counters, desks and tables.		It is a nice cup as long as it is hand washed, although I still think it looks a little cheap.		I will not get this cup again.
1,For the price, I expected better!  You can see and feel the seams, which is a deal breaker at this price point.  Other than that they seem like very nice glasses ... just not for me.  You can get this level of quality at less than half the price elsewhere on Amazon&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/8-Piece-Shatter-Resistant-Wine-Stemware-23-Oz-Tritan-Glasses-Indoors-and-Outdoors-clear/dp/B00O6YSQ5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">8 Piece Shatter Resistant Wine Stemware 23 Oz Tritan Glasses Indoors and Outdoors (clear)</a>.
1,There was no way to adjust the pepper grinder section and in trying to loosen it to get a coarser grind, the mechanism completely fell apart. As it is 32 days after purchase, it cannot be returned.
1,I specifically bought this product because it contained the chafing fuel.  It was also nice because it had three complete sets, which would cover the event I was catering.  WORTHLESS FUEL!  It BARELY lit after 20 min. of trying and then burned so low and slow once lit that the food went cold and was never warmed up.  Tried all six cans, and they were all that way.  Also burned crooked.  I don't know if they were old or what.  I had to keep rewarming in the oven and covering with foil.  Totally embarrassing, and I threw the fuel away when I came home.  At least I have the racks for future use, so I guess that's something, but I could have gotten those at Sam's Club for a couple of dollars each.

1,I think these are over priced.  Should have been half the price I paid for them. I was disappointed. Started to return, but kept them only because they did match my kitchen, and I was tired of looking.  The small canister is advertised as 3 qt, but it is not even close, maybe a little over a quart, the middle one is probably close to 3 qt, the large is probably 4 qt. So buyer beware.
1,This whistles less than  a regular flexible gas line but still whistles.
1,Bought this with a bunch of the other matching cubes for an office desk.  This one with the drawers was horrible and cheap compared to the others.  The drawers never quite aligned and look junky.
1,This is a joke, false advertisement on the part of the manufacturer. These knives were so dull I couldn't even cut my finger. I immediately packed them up and sent them back to Amazon and was given a full refund. Save your time and money on this one.
1,Not nearly as lush as pictured.  Flowers didn't cover the area they were wired to .  Not as big as advertised (sixteen inches at its widest part).  Very disappointed.
1,Piece of junk.  After babying it along for months, I gave up & tossed it in the trash.  It goes on & off when the lights in the room are turned on/off, it dispenses way too much soap, the soap is more like a strong detergent & it's made in China.  When I clean around the sink, it drops soap on the granite. Again, it's made in China.
1,Sadly, I didn't use the product enough to return it within the time frame, but after 3 uses it broke in my hand. Very disappointed. They look beautiful but are low quality.
1,For the price, I expected a little better quality product. This thing is nothing more that a knockoff Solo Cup hot glued to a dollar store candle holder. I gave this as a gift and the cup broke getting it out of the packing... Not recommended...
1,ya they are fake alright....not very nice unfortunately
1,I purchased these over a year ago. At first I was pleased with them because they are soft right out of the package. However, after you wash them a few times, it becomes apparent that the quality is pretty terrible. I washed as instructed on the care tag but soon got runs in the fabric, seams coming apart, etc.
1,This table ended up in the garbage can..........don't waste your money.  Went back to Winsome and got a much better table!
1,The two pillow shams are two different colors. Not at all the same. Requesting a refund.
1,Don't buy these. I can't even get them on the the roller. They are way too tight and nothing I do will get it to stretch. From reading some of the review, I would have to guess it would break within a short period of time if I could get it on. Right now, I can't vacuum other than with the hose. I should have noticed that on the product description it says "Dirt Devil Style," so I have to assume these are not made by Dirt Devil. A total waste of money.
1,I purchased four of these based on some of the other reviews so that I could do my own test. Once I received them I placed all of them, as close to each other as physically possible, in the middle of the refrigerator compartment. I let them sit over night to stabilize. Before I opened the door for the first time in the morning, I got my camera ready to snap a picture immediately after opening the door. The results were one indicated 37 degrees, two indicated 42 degrees and one indicated 43 degrees. I will be tossing the 37 and the 43. The other two will go in the refrigerator and the freezer.
1,did you make this yourself?
1,poor quality, I do not recommend this product.
1,Product's vertical support bars each come in four separate pieces and are made of plastic.  Unlikely to last long and heaven help you if you screw down one of the brackets too hard or don't align them correctly when installing.  I sent mine back (had to pay shipping on the return).  Can't recommend them.
1,I have an extra wide table that I needed a cover for.  The description claimed it would definitely fit the size I needed.  While it is more than long enough for it but barely covers the sides.  It doesn't fit snugly so I will have to do some alterations to it.  I could have purchased a new board for little more than this cost and saved myself all the hassle.  Would not recommend.
1,I have 2 of these pillows in firm. One of them is good, can be plumped and positioned for your comfort. The other one seems like it just has too much filling in it. It's much firmer than the other one and the filling can't be adjusted for one's personal sleeping preference like they show in the commercial.	The pillows were used at the same rate, by people roughly the same weight, so that's not the issue. I have them in the My Pillow pillow cases so neither one is squeezed into an ill fitting case that is too small.  I'm just so disappointed! I waited to write this review to see if the pillow would change with usage and time, but it has not.	I gave this 2 stars because one pillow is OK. Otherwise it'd be a 0 star for the bad/faulty pillow. I know I can't return it at this point. I just wish there was a way to exchange it. I did do the warranty. Perhaps the answer lies there. I hate the thought of losing $50 on an overfilled pillow.
1,Not sure if ours was just really old or what but when we peeled off the label, the adhesive part below it was not sticky at all. Amazon refunded the order and I put my own adhesive on it.
1,Returned.  Doesnt quite fit the paper towels to secure them
