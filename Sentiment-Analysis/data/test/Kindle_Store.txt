0,Definitivamente as sea corto esta mujer es la mejor! La forma como nos transporta y nos hace sentir la historia le la serie y esta sper nada q quitar nada q poner! te felicito !
0,Loved it. Cliffhanger, almost like the old movie serials I grew up on in the 1940s. As fast as Nathan gets one problem cleared, another crops up. But, the books are well written and keep me turning the pages.
0,When Sloane Jacobs looks at people she not only sees eyes, noses, mouths and bodies; she sees their "colors" as well.	Some are bright, happy colors. Others are ugly.	That's disquieting enough but Sloane has learned that the colors she sees also allow her to know more about the people she looks at than she really wants to know.	This unwanted ability frightens her to the point that she wonders if she is slowly going insane.	She isn't, as it turns out.	She is, instead, very special; a fact she learns when she encounters the Guardians.	In the pages of her novel "The Guardians" author Lisa Barry has built an amazing fantasy world full of strange, often beautiful, creatures that can easily pass for humans but are not. These creatures are sworn to protect humanity from monsters that are both human and inhuman and under normal circumstances they live among people who might notice they are a little more handsome, a little stronger and a little faster than the average person but not so much so that they become the objects of suspicion. It is only when danger threatens that they change into their alternate forms. Some, like Liam, turn into something akin to a 21st Century version of Medieval gargoyles while others, like Sloane's friend Nia, change into other mythical creatures.	All of them are fascinating.	As the story unfolds Sloane, who has been fearful of her abilities her whole life, learns that her special powers can help the Guardians because some of them have been disappearing without a trace. Her very rare talent for being able to "read" people's emotions might just be exactly what they need to find their missing companions.	That's as much of the plot as I'm going to reveal but trust me when I say Barry's narrative contains some very nice twists and turns and some really good action sequences that will keep you turning pages long after your body tells you it's time to put this book down and get some sleep. (It kept me up until 6 o'clock one morning because I HAD to know what happened next.)	"The Guardians" is a nice blend of adventure, mystery and romance with a dash of betrayal thrown in for good measure. Barry's characters are well drawn and intriguing - even the villains. Her writing is crisp but very descriptive and the dialogue rings true, especially the snarky exchanges between Sloane and almost everyone else.	This is the first book in what is meant to be a series of stories about the Guardians and I personally can't wait to see what happens next.	Highly recommended.
0,Brown delivers again, better that the previous books.
0,This is the continuation of the story about Ty and Lana from Desert Moon. You must have read that book before reading this one. I received an ARC from the author in exchange for an honest review.	The happily married couple is visiting Lana's family over on the east coast. This is a tense occasion because the traitorous actions of Ty's father have bled over into Ty's reputation. No one is quite sure what to think of him.	If you loved Ty and Lana before, you will love them even more after reading this one. Ty is sexy, loyal, loving, and protective of those he cares about. Lana has always known these things but watching Ty interact with her family just drives those facts further home.	Ty has always wanted cubs, three to be exact. Lana has been more concerned with having her alone time with Ty before having to share him with anyone else. Watching him play around with her nephews and nieces has her seeing him in a whole new light as a father figure.	Ty willingly chances sacrificing his own life to protect some cubs in her family during an encounter with a Sasquatch shifter in the woods. Luckily, no one was hurt...but his actions gained him the respect of the pack and they accepted him happily into their family.	After observing him being playful with the cubs and realizing just how protective he was only served to ignite a spark inside of Lana that burned with the desire to have cubs of her own. She was ready to add that dimension to their family. Cubs that wouldn't be just hers but the result of the love between her and her mate.
0,Cute little read im really enjoying this series
0,I'm still going a little crazy wanting so badly to explore this relationship so badly but I loved the background story. Getting to know Emily and Tristan was wonderful
0,At least you're not sure of who the killer is, the people don't immediately fall in love and live happily ever after, and it's pretty pleasantly written, although it could use some editing, mainly for grammatical errors. The only thing I would say is that I have trouble believing a woman could outfight several strong men, even if she did chin ups every morning and had been a gymnast. That's why they have wrestlers fight in weight categories, but the women don't have the upper body strength, even so.		Aside from that, this was a most pleasant book to whole away the hours and certainly worth the price.
0,I'm so obsessed with reading The Token.... Once I start I can't put it down until I'm finished the book. Can't wait to read the Token 7 8 & 9!!!!!
0,Author Nicole Ryan writes a story that pulls you in and doesn't let go until the very end.  Once I started reading, I couldn't put this book down.  Looking forward to reading the third and final book.
0,I totally loved this story and how you made the women highway women. It's a very interesting plot twist to to add the problems the girls were facing. I'll definitely purchase more of your stories as soon as possible. Thank you for such a wonderful story. I enjoyed every minute of it.
0,Curvy is quick, incredibly cute and steamy as hell insta-love story of a domineering alfa-male businessman and a sexy plus-size model.	Our redhead heroine is younger and of course innocent, as our hero is intense and mindful at the same time. You know, they are just another typical and perfect for each other couple in Alexa Riley's word. However I admired them, a lot actually. I liked that Cali was a sexy and confident curvy woman while Flynn was a man who knew what he wanted and went for it. And I adored that their love was pure possessiveness and raging passion, that kind which didn't fade away with time (according to the second epilogue).	As always, this was super fast but pleasantly smutty ride. And to my absolute joy we got once again sweet storyline instead dirty fantasies. I really enjoyed this, I just wish it was a bit longer.	If you're an erotica fan and don't mind a little love at first sight, go and grab this.		*An eARC kindly provided by authors in exchange for an honest review.*
0,Cool series. Bought the box set, and loved it.
0,I cannot wait for the rest of the Barron series. This is such a great story. I liked that it examined the emotions of the main characters and had the Barron family as more complex than they first appeared. The twist at the end was a bit unexpected and it takes a lot to throw me for a loop. I think I may re-read the story tonight.
0,This was a story of a writer, Jess, and her lawyer boyfriend Max who are working on a story for the magazine Jess writes for in which they have a list of sexual experiments they must perform for her to blog about. Entertaining to watch them work through the list, very erotic scenes and real emotions with a very happy ending.
0,Sweet Perdition ~ 4 stars	I don't read that many MC books so I didn't know what to expect when I started reading this. I really liked it and ended up reading it a one sitting. I loved Elizabeth and Ryker although there were a couple times that I wanted to reach into my kindle and smack him around a little for being such a jerk. I really liked all the side characters and I cant wait to read their stories. I couldn't figure out whether or not the Four Horsemen were criminals, which left a little bit of a mystery for future books as well. My only complaint was the length. I wanted to stay with Elizabeth and Ryker a little longer. I hope to see them again.		Hot as Hades ~ 4.5 stars	This was a great book. How could you not love a military stripper and a cowboy biker? I know that sounds like a little bit of an odd combo but is worked so well in this story. Daisy kicks butt and she knows want she needs to do to in order find her sister. And then theres Cowboy *fans self,* hot, sexy and a softy in the inside. One big difference between this book and book one in the series was suspense. I was expecting lots of steamy scenes (which there were) but not the suspense and twists and turns this story takes you on. Its definitely a wild ride. Be prepared for some late night reading because you will not want to put this down. In this installment you're also introduced to more of the Four Horseman MC family. I think the author has done a great job setting up future books with some amazing characters. I cant wait to read them.
0,Some of these recipes are so good!  I am in love....yum!
0,I loved this book. Think it was the kind of rescue that every woman wants after her heart is broken by another.
0,Carol Davis is able to spin a wonderful story, no matter what the subject, and Something Simple is no different. I would definitely advise picking up this book and giving it a read.
0,I love trying new recipes and have added this to my collection. I also love my Kindle and having my recipes available in this format is great. No more torn pages or missing books. I'm happy.
0,A beautiful happy sad bitter sweet love story that made my heart soar and my tears fall down my cheeks on public transport.  Highly recommended to all the romantics who believe THAT ONE who's love you since the beginning of time is out there.  Thank-you miss Bloom.
0,I was recommended this author from a Facebook group I'm in dedicated to erotic romance books. Wow! Did this book deliver!! I'm not a part of the BDSM community, but have been extremely intrigued by it for several years, and erotic books have become my favorite genre. I have found many stories not quite believable and focus more on the sex than the emotional bond that is supposed to be the foundation of a BDSM relationship according to what I've learned. This book really hit the nail on the head. Both main characters are believable and feel like real people. The writing makes you feel the emotions, turmoil and struggles they are going through. The sex scenes are scorching hot, but focus not just on achieving orgasm, but achieving emotional connections also. I'm so glad I found Sebastian Ex, because after reading just this one book I am now a die hard fan. I've already purchased and downloaded several others. If you are looking for a hot, steamy erotica novel that is written excellently, emotionally stimulating and completely believable, then this book is for you.
0,Second books are always hard to write as there tends to be a lull or drag but not this one!!!!! Poor Shae, she just can't catch a break and Jasper is the only thing keeping her sane. What she discovers is heart breaking and you really feel the emotion come through the words. I loved the ending and has to read the last book no matter what time it was!
0,Diane Darcy does a great job (again!) of retelling fairy tales in a modern-day setting. I love the witty dialogue and the situational humor, and I especially love that the author does it so sweetly. The hero and heroine are wonderful. I wanted them to end up together. He's like a big gruff bear, himself, and she is the Goldilocks who ends up in his house. Accidentally. The side story of the young boy is touching. Tell me another fairy tale, Ms. Darcy!
0,You know I really enjoy reading but I'm getting kind of tired or all these parts you author want to write to a book please start giving a full book
0,This was a very good book. I had a hard time figuring almost anything out. Once I got into the book, I couldn't't put it down. It was mysterious, exciting, scary and I loved it.
0,I have read all the Mitchell/Healy series. They have made me laugh and made me cry. They are a strong caring family helping each other through the bad time, and yes they do have some pretty bad times, and then they celebrate the goods Times. I would recommend it will be a great read for you all. Thanks Jennifer Foor.
0,I received an ARC edition of this book for an honest review.		The story hooked me right away. Chloe starts her internship at Frost Industries and during lunch banters with a man regarding smoothies. Not realizing who he is, of course he is Ethan Frost the owner. However she doesn't know that. Their interactions following this are cute,fun and a little sexy. He obviously desires her, and she desires him however she has issues from her past that are preventing her from moving forward. When Chloe is finally able to tell her story Ethan is incredibly understanding and caring. I don't know many men that would be that empathic, but this is fiction and Ethan is amazing. Of course, there is a bump in the road of their new relationship, and the ending was a BIG surprise. I am assuming there is a 2nd book because you can't just leave us hanging like that!		Ethan and Chloe are damaged but they are a fun, loving, sexy couple. I would recommend this book.
0,Dedication	For all those looking for a Cinderella moment.		Ms. Daryl Chambers, Insurance Risk Assessor from Gleeshal and Eversteen for The Tienimi Club, was experiencing a very difficult day. Thanks to the non-gender-specific nature of her name- the staff at Tienimi expected a Man!	After a humorously detailed adventure (I will not explain about it here  Dearest Bookworm  You Must Experience It For Yourself!)		She finally made it to her destination and would get a chance to put the entire day behind her with a hot bath and a cold beer - at one of the owners villas instead of one of the mens staff apartments. BUT  Mr. Cameron Blake  Cam  who she was assigned to liaison with at Tienimi might just put a monkey-wrench into the works 		He was young, my age or a year or two older perhaps, gloriously tanned with soft light brown, almost blonde, hair that obscured his bright blue eyes. His features were chiseled and he gave off a sporty vibe, fit and toned. Not my type. Well, actually, exactly my type; the type that would never look at me twice, not with my over-sized ass, bulging breasts and love handles that wouldnt look out of place on a trophy, I was a bit rounded than other women and was generally overlooked by handsome men because of it.		Will Cam and Daryl keep their relationship Strictly Professional? OR will sparks fly and ignite a raging fire between the two?  Can Cam rise to the occasion and not screw-up? Will Daryl complete her insurance risk assessment of Tienimi in a timely manner? These questions and more will be answered with this tantalizing tale of contemporary romance.		This is the Book 5 and the final one in the Tienimi Club Series. Wonderful Authoress Ms. Fray outdoes herself by tying up loose ends and giving the reader a Fantastic, rip-roaring ride of a Great Read!		The description alone of the journey from the airport in Hawaii to The Tienimi Club for Ms. Daryl Chambers had me laughing so hard  tears were falling and my stomach was hurting from the deep belly laughs. The wonderful characters continued to grow and learn from life  realistic. The pace was fast   Yet, I did not want this series to end  I came to care about ALL of the characters and their lives.		Forever, I will not divulge ANY spoilers, Gorgeous Reader.		I gave this book five (5) stars as I have each book in this Simply Outstanding Series!		I passionately propose that you, Bodacious Bookworm buy this Entire Series.
0,Baaabaayy that Gucci Red one smart diva Bunny I love it!! Talking about scandalicious!!! Hunnu I know she won't let them get away with trying to play her for a fool!!! I can't wait to read book two cuz I know it's gone be on and poppin!!
0,I received an ARC for an honest review. Loved this book! I couldn't put it down! Nash Bell is a sexy, arrogant, cocky bad boy but he has some great lines! His dialogue makes me laugh especially when he's teasing Selena, the college student he 'hired' to be his wife temporarily. Nash wrote a book about his life as a SEAL and he became famous, especially with women (it didn't hurt hurt that he was a gorgeous hunk). He wasn't happy on the book tour so he drank and screwed his way across the country and his 'publishers' were unhappy since he was supposed to be an All American hero. He decides to one-up them and marries a normal college girl that he met at a book signing, Selena Wood (she intrigued him). She eventually agrees because the one million dollars he offers her could help her father with his cancer treatment. The characters are well developed, the banter, when they aren't fighting is fun, the sex is STEAMY! Will their relationship remain professional as intended? Or will their off-the-charts chemistry interfere? Will they or won't they kiss, book-up, fall in love, breakup? If you really want to know (and you DO), you'll read the book!
0,I loved this book. It was really nice to read a really long, well written book. I am going to get more books by this author. Am looking forward to more books in this series.
0,Lucia Jordan is the best at keeping you wondering.  The characters are not doing anything you expect. Cliffhangers left and right.
0,Jackie always has good information and has a way of making the information easy to understand but still enjoyable to read.
0,Jesse & Tamieka !	Alpha male saw what	& who he wanted !	Staked his claim	From Vegas with	Love !!!!
0,I was a little bit leery of this book because of the title. I tend to shy away from any book with "confidential" in its title. But instead of the sensationalism that confidential is often means it was a more of a "between you and me" situation.		Doctor Confidential: Secrets Behind the Veil by Richard A. Sheff spoke of his personal experiences of a young medical student all the way through to his senior residency. My father was a family doctor. He was back from WWII and going through med school when I was in elementary school so I think back to my memories of him and think about what Dr. Sheff went through.		Richard Sheff started medical school with the idea of being a psychiatrist because of his rewarding experience of leading groups in the past but something happened as he explored the different specialties. He explores what it is like to be on a seemingly endless schedule without refreshing sleep and treat so many people. What is the answer? Studies have shown that shortening the shifts does not work, that there are more hours. Why? Because the interns are seeing the same number of patients in fewer hours. What is the solution?		Dr. Sheff tells of doctors who made a game of humiliating their interns. A few of doctors make a game of it. Just as in law school. Is this the best way to teach? As an intern, he said that there are times of not knowing what to do yet being called on to do it. I think that his picture of what goes on during doctor training, points out many of the faults, the heartbreaks and feeling of empathy for patients on rounds. I agree with him. I have been seen on the rounds as a patient. It is humiliating. It does feel like you are being used and there is no regard for your feelings.		This book was written in 2011. Some things have changed for the good but others still the same. There are many other kinds of experiences of interns that he explores in this book as to whether or not they are helpful or harmful.		I highly recommend this book as a true picture of a doctor in training and also a critique of things that need to change.
0,I liked his explanation and examples on how to succeed in advertising in order to get your business started in order to make money in whatever business you would like to run.
0,Creepy, morbid, weird and strange, The Halloween Collection from Indie Eclective is a flat out variety filled collection of Halloween stories ranging from ghosts and spirits to werewolves and vampires. Since the book is written by multiple authors, no two stories are exactly alike; all are capable of making skin crawl and hair stand on end. Please read my full review here:  http://mjjoachim.blogspot.com/2014/10/book-review-halloween-collection-from_14.html
0,What an amazing story!  This is the first book that I have read by this author and I can promise that I will be reading everything else that she has written!!
0,Juicing for Weight Loss is a collection of guides to using a juicer to help you obtain weight loss and overall better health.  I thought that this set had a lot of helpful tips and some delicious recipes.  I haven't tried all of them yet, but I have made over twenty of them and loved them all.  I think this book is a great tool if you want to start juicing or even if you are an experienced juicer.  If you like to juice check out this book, you'll be glad you did.		4 out of 5 stars for this great juicing guide.
0,A very different but another one you can't put down.  It had several twists, and brought back some unhappy history truths.
0,I always enjoy Jess Williams novels. After reading these novels, I keep a watch for the next in this series. Sometimes, I become impatient waiting, but I understand that it requires time and effort, to write novels. I will continue reading this series as they are published.
0,Would highly recommend to my friends and family. A very good book that kept me reading & reading. My kind of book!
0,A good read that has some twists and turns. There were few grammatical errors and it held my interest right to the end.  I recommend this book without reservation or hesitation.
0,Thrilling and surprising book with viewpoint from a mature fifteen year old. Nice filler between books about 15. Shock and awe!
0,this series has been fun to read.
0,Is she his wife? But amnesia clouds her mind preventing her from remembering her past. Danger follows her. This book was a keep one on the seat of the chair good and suspenseful
0,This was a quick, addictive read.  I adored Calder and Frankie's relationship.  I feel like the issues addressed were handled with care, and the relationship Elisabeth Grace built between Calder and Frankie's mom was beyond sweet (it may actually have been one of my favorite parts of this book - the way those two connected).  There's some steam here which makes the spark between Calder and Frankie a little more intense.  My only criticism is that it seemed like the story was rushed sometimes - like we were rushed through Calder dealing with his issues and into the resolution.  That said - this book has everything I need to make me a happy reader and I'd definitely recommend it.
0,Very good
0,Stay with Me is the kind of book I may have to read again just to catch everything. Its romance, suspense, and a look at real life, which is messy, as Jim reminds us. This book is stronger because the development of the characters clearly shows their flaws making them more genuine.		Savi Barnes is strong and independent but still learns some life lessons. I liked her, her dad and her daughter. This is a family that could be just down the road when Savi was growing up, a dear friend now that she is older. Ian and Duncan, well, what can I say, I understood the difficulty she had on choosing. However, life is full of choices, then learning to live with the consequences. There was plenty of that in this story.		Sharla Lovelace writes stories where the characters are at a divided path and must choose the one to take. Her books are not fluff or light but instead thought provoking. This one is no different. Would I have made the same choices as Savi, or encourage to do the same? See what I mean, makes you think.		Copy provided by NetGalley for an honest review.
0,Wow, this was worth the wait. At the end of ENTANGLED HEARTS - VOLUME I, it was really good as I reached the last sentence and then no more sentences.  I thought of a few scenarios that should have been the end but I am glad Yahrah gave us the right version of Chynna, Kenya, Lucas, and Noah. What a great love story with suspense, mystery, and love. It could have been very bad for Chynna if she was not able to reevaluate her life and see what she need to do in order to move forward in her music. Then the opportunity for Kenya to move forward in her chosen career and for them to find love with Noah and Lucas.  WOW!!!!
0,I found this book very informative on ways to eating healthier. I received this product for free and I love it.
0,This book was that much and more than I expected, the writer did real good with the story telling from beginning to end.	I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a romantic suspense thriller.	I can't wait for the next one.
0,Simply wonderful and quite well written. One of the fun parts of reading Grace Burrowes is the great vocabulary she uses in each story. Reading her stories also provides connectors to a extraordinary family.
0,They say best friends make the best lovers, but for Kiera shes in denial on that point.  When Kiera is dumped out of nowhere by her boyfriend of 4 years, Jimmy, she goes straight to her best friend Kevin, moves in and things start to change in their relationship, she is heartbroken and hung up on Jimmy and at first Kevin is her shoulder, but as time goes by and she still isn't getting over Jimmy he gets more frustrated with her, and one night they end up almost sleeping together and it throws a real wrench in everything.  Kiera wants Kevins friendship, her rock, shoulder and the one she can tell everything too; she also wants the wild, uninhibited, ecstasy he gives her in the bedroom.  Unfortunately she also wants the safe, secure, family with children life she feels only Jimmy can give her (even if that life is mind numbingly boring).  What Kiera doesnt know is there is more going on then she realizes and what her heart and mind want are not the same.  Attention grabbing storyline, endearing characters that could be your friends or neighbors a wealth of emotional situations (way to many of us have probably faced) all well blended to make a real must read, over and over!
0,This story was a HOT SEXY mess, and I loved it. KINGSTON come find me, LAVISH me with ur love, smilin. Only thing I hated about this read was it was 2 short. There is nothing like a good hot sexy Vampire story that gets the body tempted, I want more of KINGSTON..this was a tru tease, but well done 5 Star BANGER		Keep'em coming	Cotton Carpenter
0,I saw this book in my recommended reading list and the storyline caught my attention so I decided to give it a try. So glad I did. I really enjoyed Jake and Natalie's story. The addition of Natalie's family was an added treat. I really loved that it wasn't the typical alpha male or billionaire but was instead a nice steamy romance with some laughs thrown in. Glad to discover this author and would definitely read her again.
0,I am not quite sure what to say about this story... It was a quick read, fast paced and I liked parts of it.  But some of the stuff was just too hard to just accept.  For me it was a little disjointed. Like the headline, this story just had me confused in a kinda good way.  Will I read the next story in the sequel....probably will ...if nothing else but to at least try to understand wtf is really going on. Needless to say I am still undecided about this book but on the other hand I am still willing to give it another chance to confuse me more.  Did I confuse u?
0,I am really enjoying this series Taking The High Road from my favorite author Morris Fenris. Like the previous books in the series, this is a delightful historical romance story that I fully enjoyed. I read this in one sitting from beginning to end, because it was well written and full of exciting events that kept me wondering what was going to happen next. A special western romance with a surprise ending. Highly recommend.
0,I love any book that is in this series. This writer is my number two on my all time favorite list. I am very happy that Jim finally got his mate. I love llona's books.
0,This book was great! Jack and Noelle were the perfect couple.  Two people who loved each other from afar for years finally got the chance to be together.  Though their relationship started in a odd way the love was real and true.  The supporting characters in the book were amazing and I can't wait to read all of their stories
0,I'm sorry the stories ended. I want to read everything about them and any background that will flesh out the characters and the story.
0,You never hear of a girl being a virgin after the age of 21, usually after 18, but Ashlyn is a 25 year old grad student and a virgin. Her friends sign her up for a dating site where she meets Braydon, a handsome billionaire that's still recovering from his fiance walking out on him a week before their married. They go skiing expecting to have a one night fling, but end up snowed in. They end up falling for one another, but Braydon hasn't been truthful about who he is. She believes he's just a fitness instructor when in reality he owns a chain of gyms and is currently working on expanding into Canada. The way she find out ends things pretty quickly. It nearly destroyed them both. Love this story and goes to show that if you expect honesty from everyone else you need to be honest with them too.
0,Enjoyed this short. Like with all shorts the story line was kinda rushed but it's a short story so it's too be expected
0,This was a nice short story about Angela.  Its a nice quick read to tide you over till the next book comes out.
0,"Mine" by Regina Puckett	Alle had no idea James would take her ghost hunting at the mental facility on their first date, she bought new shoes, did her hair and dressed for a movie,maybe. They meet a bunch of James friends at the hospital. When they got there they pared off into groups of two and began exploring all the different buildings. Alle held onto James shirt to stay together, until she turned around to see what a noise was and James was gone when she turned back around. She wasn't scared at first...enough said, you really need to download the book to read the rest. You won't be disappointed. Short story, but twist and turns you don't expect.
0,I liked this story. Cookie deserves happiness and I hope Meeko can give her that despite all of the drama that comes along with him.  I'm hoping they can work past the things that have arisen in the midst of them building a relationship. The last thing cookie needs is someone else to add to the insecurities that her mother that caused her to have. I'm looking forward to part 2 and I will be checking out more work by La'Tonya!
0,I grew up in a family with mostly men, it was just me and my mother as females and then when I started my own family I was the only female. As a result I endured many football games and I didn't like it because I didn't understand it.		Yes, its the most popular sports in the world so here I am now trying to play catch up.  So, Ive learned that each team has eleven (11) players, the description of the field is more vivid in my mind because of how the book describes it and the first game of football was played in 1869.		I read about some basic terminologies I didn't know before, also about positions in the game, this is a very informative book which will allow me to appreciate the game and be more interactive among the men in my life when the games are on.
0,This book rocked! I really enjoyed reading Gloves story. It totally makes me understand the reason he is the way he is. I had no idea that he was a foster child. I won't tell you what he feels his demons are. Even though he kept putting himself down and not thinking he was worth enough, he in the end realizes he is worthy! I am really happy with what happens in the ending. I was actually waiting for it to happen. Yes as I said i the last 3 books once you start reading you just can't put it down. Very good book!
0,If you like alot of romance and have always wondered what it would be like to be with a rock star. Then this is the book for you to read
0,I absolutely loved this story.  The first book was awesome, this one took my breath away.  So romantic, so sexy, and at times laugh out loud funny.
0,Funny, must read
0,good book
0,This was a good story.  It had drama, adventure, acceptance and sex.  The story line flowed well and the characters were believable.  The story had acceptance of mature characters both male and female.  I really enjoyed this installment of the series.
0,Close to Heart was my first time reading anything from T.J. Kline, and I adored her take on a small town romance.		First, Id like to mention that this story involves a very pregnant heroine and touches on the sensitive subject of verbal/emotional abuse.  There is very good reason why Alyssa Cole accidentally winds up in the small town where Heart Fire Ranch is located. She ends up in a dire situation that leads her to meeting veterinarian Justin Hart.		Lyssa, you're the kind of trouble I could get used to.		What was it about Justin that could make her feel like a teenage girl on her first date again?		I liked both Lyssa and Justin! Lyssa is a successful Hollywood actress who is seeking a new beginning. Shes very down to earth and an animal-loving person, which is a good thing, because Justin is all about taking care of animals. All you cowboy-loving ladies out there need to get to know Justin Hart. He makes mistakes, but family means something to him, and thats a quality I love in a hero.		The fire in you is beautiful, something to be stoked and tended, not something to hide.		The antagonist is Lyssas husband, and hes someone whos selfish and has no heart. As mentioned, the plot touches on sensitive issues, and Lyssa goes through realistic motions when dealing with her situation. I found the characters perfectly imperfect, yet strong and well paired. Although this is book 3 in the series, Close to Heart can be read as a standalone. Justins sisters are in this story with slight glimpses into their backgrounds. I adore the overall theme of this series in that the Hart siblings heal their hearts with the love that enters into each of their lives. The secondary characters were fun to get to know, especially Bailey. I think Bailey deserves her own book just for being a cool cousin! Close to Heart is engaging, heart-warming, and will make you smile. *I was gifted this book, and this is my honest review.
0,Loved the descriptions of starting boot camp training and descriptions of physical and mental growth ar end of boot camp or training camp.  Loved that she got the pay back of sentencing of 100 years for the villain who caused her fathers downfall and death.
0,I just love  every book that this author  has written so far and this series is just as good. I do not usually read anything that is even slightly paranormal but Terry Bolryder has made me a fan of shifters. Her stories grip you from the first page til the end. You would scoff at the thought of men turning into bears but these are written so well that you don't even think about it. Every story is a love story with a woman being the fated "mate" of a man who just happens to turn into a fierce bear who will defend the ones he loves. And boy can he!
0,I was so happy that Mike wrote a second book and I hope he keeps them coming. They are soooo interesting to read and I can hardly put the kindle down when reading them! Great work...
0,Its been four months since Zack Grantham, hockey player for the Cold Fury, lost his partner, Gina in a car accident. Life hasn't been the same, and hes struggling to pick up the pieces while raising his son, Ben. He hires nanny Kate to help watch Ben while Zacks back playing. And of course, romance happens.		The Good, The Bad and Everything In Between		Engrossing read: I was wrapped up in the story and I tore through it in a day.		Kates a fantastic heroine: Shes pragmatic, empathetic, great with kids, and way more understanding than many women would be. Her ability to understand what Zacks going through and not hold it against him was admirable and I loved her adorkable ways. Shes a big reason why I enjoyed this book.		I like a good nanny romance: Something about putting two adults together while caring for a child, and seeing them grow closer always fascinates me. Zack can be a right prick, but the one thing that really shone is his love for his son.		Excellent chemistry: The scenes where Zack catches Kate in the kitchen in her tank top and shorts, and realizes how Kates been hiding herself behind baggy clothes was great. The sexual tension fairly seeped from the page and I really enjoyed seeing that sexual tension build until they gave in.		Love after death of a partner: It can be such an emotional thing, to see someone try to rebuild their life after the death of a loved one, and I believe that as humans, were capable of so much love. What I wasn't expecting was Zacks feelings towards Gina and the way they were portrayed here. I appreciated that his feelings were complicated and there was survivors guilt mixed in with the lack of love (more on that later), and I liked the way Ms. Bennett took the time to delve into the not-so-pretty feelings Zack had, even if I disagreed with some of them.		Zacks wracked with guilt: One of my issues with this book, and why its not rated as highly as the earlier books, is the way his earlier relationship was dismissed. If youve read the series, Zack and Gina were an established couple when the books began, so I could understand going down this route for Zack. What I didn't think was necessary was to minimize his relationship with Gina. It cheapened things a bit in my eyes. The story could have packed its own emotional punch, simply having Zack move on from Ginas death. Of course, the timeframe for this romance...yeah, it didn't work for me.		Struggled with a couple of things, including the timeline: I probably could have accepted this if perhaps more than four months had passed before the start of this story. That all of this happens mere months after Gina died felt a bit rushed, and even minimizing his relationship with Gina, still didn't work for me. Add this to the lack of real grovel factor...		Needed more grovel: Now, Zack spends quite a bit of time in a cycle of guilt, lashing out at Kate for making him feels things, contrition, repeat.  Zacks treatment of Kate was harsh whenever he pushed her away, and frankly he was a selfish prick for a good portion of the story. At the end, I really wanted more of grovel to make it all worth it and while theres an apology, it didn't go very far. Kates understanding went a long way towards my acceptance of it all but I think a couple of tweaks would have made me adore this story, as opposed to wanting to smack Zack upside the head for most of it.		The Bottom Line	I liked it, even if I struggled with some of Zacks actions. Still, the Cold Furys a fave hockey romance series, and Im interested in reading the next book, since Ryker seems right up my alley.		**ARC provided by publisher via netgalley for review**
0,A really cute book. It is one of those books that you cant wait to finish. It's funny and the characters are fun to explore and get to know. You won't be disappointed.
0,thoroughly enjoyed!!!
0,This book of wacky opposites engages young children, while being fun to read out loud and something that they can quickly handle on their own. Great for the classroom!
0,I will read anything and everything by Lilliana Hart. You will not be disaapointed with this series. I like all the story lines and humor she puts into her writing. While waiting for the next installment of this series and the Mackenzie Family series. I am going to start the JJ.Graves mysteries.
0,This tale is not a typical story to read with a plot of characters achieving an arc	of mystery and intrigue.  Rather it is an experience. The author places the reader	in the middle of the wonderland between Wales and England to view, smell, and	feel every aspect of the area. To him, the experience is not a narrow path with a	highlight or two, but a total fulfillment of similes and metaphors stretching the	mind to appreciate the fullest of details.  Perhaps the best time to read this book is	between stories of high tension when the mind needs to look at things differently	and ground itself with the beauty of nature and its peoples.
0,Another awesomesauce story from the fertile mind of Erin Tate. Humor, love, huge aliens what more could you ask for?
0,This is the second book written by Suzanne G Rogers  that I have  read and I am greatly impressed by her ability to write a love story that does not base the story on the need to have sex as the answer to being in love. Well written and enjoyable story. Thank you.
0,This book is packed with so much good information on growing squash. I love to grow squash organically but have had many problems over the last few years. I have learned so much from this book and many of this authors other books too. I am an experienced gardener and always learn so much from all of his books. He lists many references and useful links too. Highly recommend this book as well as all his others too. He writes so well that you really enjoy reading the book and actually want to read it beginning to end. This book is worth every penny. I hope he continues to write books because he writes so well.
0,love it can't wait to read the next chapter too bad I have to wait til next month.  I like to see what happens next.
0,My Review:	I enjoyed this book. This was one of those that simply made me happy that I read contemporary romance.		Jillian has moved to Montana after having her heart broken. Her brother lives there and she has a huge group of friends there. Zach is not one of those things pulling her to the place though. A while ago when she was home for a visit, they had a one-night stand that was phenomenal, but now has left things a little awkward and stilted between them. But their lives are intertwined. Her best friend is married to his twin and they share the same group of friends so they are constantly in each other's environment.		I enjoyed the way the book started out with Jillian dating and Zach incredibly and obviously jealous. That sparked off the chemistry between the two just perfectly. And there is a ton of chemistry.		This story is one of those full of scenes with the group of friends and the families. I love that dynamic to my contemporary romance because it gives such a warm, happy, cozy feeling to the story and setting. This one is also set in Montana in the winter which also, for me, evokes those same emotions...safety, warmth, coziness while snuggling in front of the fire.		Jillian is trying to learn how to move on with her life and Zach and Seth quickly become integral to that. I love her interactions with Seth especially. Their relationship works so well in this book and I love how he reacts to his dad during the "black moment" of the story.		It's just one of those books that's good. I don't think it would matter what time of the year it was, what mood I was in...this is a book I could re-read a dozen times and it would still make me feel happier in the end for doing so. Definitely my favorite type of read.		I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review.
0,One of the most common problems of a mom like me is how to get back our figure and loose our muffin top bellies. It is very engaging to know that there is a certain diet specifically concerning bellies. This book is very informative and the recipes are very structural. It is actually more than a recipe but an instructor which guides you in what you have to take in each meal. I tried grain-free banana pancakes and my daughter loved it too! I am now looking forward to the results of the new diet this book introduces.
0,I wish I could say that I loved this story. It was good but for the hero to know he is in love with the heroine after not only admitting that he barely remembers her from their younger days before they were married and sleeping with his mistress on their wedding day, but he also is only home for about a week before he declares that he is in love with his wife and she is hostile towards him. I am unsure how I can feel it on his behalf. I do understand that he thought by spending his wedding night with another woman that he was getting back at the heroine's father. He did not consider her feelings at all because it was all about revenge. He did think about it as soon as the morning after the wedding and realized that he betrayed her. She was not on his mind until after he did it and then he felt so guilty that he left for 6 years. I would feel better about him actually understanding what he has done to his wife if it was stated that he remained faithful throughout those 6 years. I cannot believe he felt guilty and regretted his actions while thinking he has been sleeping with other women all these years. It makes it unbelievable. I just wish that was said so I know one way or another. He also wrote letters galore for years so I am hoping he was faithful to her from that point on. That would make him redeemed in my eyes.
0,This was a really great short story. It didn't take me long to read it but the story turned out to be really good. I recommend this to anyone who wants a quick read that is a wonderful story! Keep it on the Hush!
0,This entire book blew me away from start to finish,  and was not at all what I expected.  This wasn't the typical "good girl meets thug" story though had some of the same active ingredients.  This plot twist was unlike anything I have experienced in a very long time. Every time I thought I was with the program and able to judge the next course of treatment I was always out in left field. The lies, secrets, dysfunction, deception, revenge, hate and jealousy knocked me off my feet and left me with my mouth open on so many occasions.  I think the only time I had a correct clue was when I actually assumed that the concert Nina was about to attend was Ricques. Why didn't he come back for her or attempt to contact her after all those years considering what they had shared and how special it was?  Why oh why did he and Saint have to be brothers?  Poor, poor, little Nina and then to further complicate the entire issue, cousins were sisters and due to incest? And then the baby?  Why do bad things happen to good people? I highly recommend this read without hesitation even if this isn't your usual genre. My kudos to Ms Armstead.
0,Great book as usual. I always enjoy reading about my favorite football quarterback. Can't wait until the next book.
0,I liked the storyline in the sequence of the books and enjoyed seeing how the story unfolded for each character.  I'm a bit old for rock and roll fantasies, but I love music, so I was pretty hooked with the series.
0,Ava Stone believes in the power of love to conquer all, and to do so at the speed of light. The pace of this story was a bit fantastical. The hero went from stoic to besotted so fast it left me unsatisfied. Also, I would have liked to know how the heroine came to the conclusions she did about her former fiance. A single scene, perhaps at the initial  ball, in which the villain cornered the girl and showed his ruthlessness, would have gone a long way to giving the book more depth.		And one more comment. I found the way the men kept referring to women as "chits" quite annoying.		Yet I did enjoy this novel. Stone is reliable for a good regency. I keep her on my to-be-read list.
0,Christa Wick has a dirty little naughty mind and I like it.  Collin takes Mia on a journey that reveals her needs and wants. While he thinks he's driving the boat she is lighthouse that leads him to calm waters in the midst of their storm.
0,Received an ARC from NetGalley for review		I've read other stories where someone has PTSD and it never fails to break my heart with what our very brave soldiers go through to protect our freedoms. There was a great romance included too. Boy, those ex's deserved everything they got. My only complaint was he keep hinting how it might have been a setup, but there was no real resolution to that point. Other than that, job well done.		I liked the teaser chapter for the next book. I was hoping it was going to be their HEA.
0,An addictive series with some sexy bikers but not the nice kind.	This second book in the series picks up where the first left off which is a continuance of Shadow and Dani's story.		Shadow as all the authors characters have a past and let's just say they're not always so nice.  Shadow has a past that scarred him but Dani broke past it.  But this is not a smooth transition.  They have to deal with her crazy mother, the FBI, and all the while having Dani's father Bull watch what is growing between these two without it interfering with his job in the MC.  It has darker tones at times yet I just couldn't seem to stop myself from reading and wanting more.  Family is what the club stands for and it's scary the depths that they will go to to insure their family is safe.	I'm embarrassingly addicted and already bought the next two books.
0,Before I start my review, I would like to thank C.J. Anaya for allowing me to review My Fair Assassin.		**All opinions stated in this review are mine and mine alone. I received My Fair Assassin from C.J. Anaya and voluntarily reviewed it**		Now onto my review:		When I first started reading My Fair Assassin, I was kinda meh about it. I mean, who would be OK with a strange guy appearing in their apartment and announcing their intention to kill them? Not me. I think I would be running around the apartment screaming my fool head off. But Crysta was pretty laid back about it. Once you get past that first chapter, the book gets much more interesting.		I liked Crystas character. While she looks different (white hair, blue eyes, pointy ears), is a vegan and she has powers that she cant understand but she is pretty down to earth, very funny and sarcastic. She also suffers from poor body image. In order to fit in, she filed her ears down and dyes her hair blonde. I felt so sad when she explained why she did that and it does reflect what tween/teenagers are going through in todays society.  As a mother of a tween girl, I think it is very refreshing to see these issues addressed.		Jareth, on the other hand (fans self), is a total hottie. Think a male version of Crysta but with more powers than her. I just didn't like that he knew everything and let it trickle down to her. But considering her self-esteem/trust issues, I do think it was a wise choice and you could tell how much he cared about her.		I didn't care for the Instalove BUT it went well with the story. To be honest, I think that Jareth had Instalove first, which was a first for me to read, and he just waited for Crysta to follow suit. Like I said, it made sense. You really need to read the story to fully understand what I am saying.		The ending was pretty interesting. Things came out that kinda surprised me. One of those things, I figured out as soon as Jareth appeared in Crystas apartment. The other main thing did surprise me and it made me a little sad for Jareth.		How many stars will I give My Fair Assassin? 4		Why? This was a good fantasy/Ya book with a great message in it. The author does include a note at the end of the book that she wrote it for her teenage niece and that brought tears to my eyes. It was very sweet!!		Will I reread? Yes		Will I recommend to family and friends? Yes		Age Range: Teen		Why? Some violence, some kissing.but no sex.
0,BRAIN KILLED SAVANNAH PARENTS I DON'T KNOW WHO KILLED HER SISTER. SAVANNAH IS PREGNANT BY BRANDON AND THEY ARE HAVING TWINS AND ROXIE KEPT COMING AFTER SAVANNAH EVEN THOUGH SHE  SLEPT WITH BRANDON EVEN THOUGH IT WAS JUST A ONE NIGHT STAND. NOW THEY MOVED TO GEORGIA AND THEY ARE GETTING MARRIED.
0,This was good Gothic; not great Gothic. If you want a good beach read or something to curl up with at night this will fit that bill. It keeps you reading; characters although not deep are not one-dimensional either. It could use a good editor but the story will stand well in the Gothic romance genre.
0,Love of Country is book three of the Country Love series by Vicki Green.  It is a really suspenseful book that is not intended for anyone under 18.  The graphic sex scenes and the violence described make it totally inappropriate for anyone under 18.  The book review on Amazon definitely states this.  Perhaps it says this on the book; but I got the Kindle version so I don't know.  It is only through honest reviews that we get this information.  Except for those scenes, the book is absolutely wonderful.	Trevor MacKay came to this small town to keep an eye on his friend Shiloh Willson.  He had been helping her get free from her captor for years.  He also knew she wrote a series of books detailing her captivity and the cruelty of her captor.  However, Mikael was dead and Trevor was in the hospital with wounds from the final fight.  He also had a past of his own which he hadnt come to grips with.  He had done some things he wasn't proud of and was even ashamed of.  Not facing those mistakes was causing nightmares.  He wanted to go home to his small farm and forget everything.  Although he was very handsome and the ladies really liked him, he never gave them the impression that he would settle down with one of them.  The love of his life had gone out of it when he was a boy.  However, his love for her and the pain of his broken heart made him resolve never to get himself in that position again.  He could not take another broken heart.	 Caprice Greer was barely sixteen when he killed her parents and took her captive.  She had already lost her big sister so now Caprice was totally alone.  Her captor kept her in captivity for three horrible years when he faced Trevor MacKay and Shiloh Willson and lost his life.  Now Caprice was totally lost.  Trevor, knowing what Shiloh had gone through with the captor, asked Caprice to come to his house to take care of him when the hospital released him.  He felt he could at least listen and help her.  Caprice agreed because she felt she owed him for giving her life back to her.  Is she making a mistake?	Will Trevor be able to help her or will he simply add to her problems?  What will she uncover about the love of his life when he finally tells Caprice about her?  Will he manage to straighten out his own life?
0,Great characters a swashbuckling story with the woman being the force that must be reckoned with other strong male characters.
0,If you thought Donna and Connor were sexy, just wait until you read Ivie and Lex. Donna and Connor are almost mild compared to them. Lex has what you may call a 'kinky' side and Ivie has had her share of boring men and been wanting more. But she was highly traumatized in the first book, so letting down her walls to the enigmatic Lex is no easy task. But the attraction and chemistry is undeniable. And once those walls come down, Lex is a no holds barred kind of guy.		These two were super sexy, but I will also say they were super sweet. Lex may have been an alpha male of the nth degree, but after living for so long, once he found the woman for him, he was also tender and considerate and devoted. Ivie gets all sides of him, and that's what I really liked in their relationship. The two of them really helped each other and completed each other.		But the paranormal world is still in heavy turmoil, with danger around every bend. There's so much really exciting stuff happening here - deciphering good and bad guys, protecting humans, discovering new abilities, and breaking down barriers. This is a really fun world CC has created and the stories are getting better and better. You know I'll be happily continuing this series.
0,This story was amazing. I literally didn't put it down until I was finished. I loved the young love story and then circumstances and time get in the way. I loved how they worked through the problems and came together. The heartache was real and the love too. The characters, the plot, the whole book was epic! Hope this turns into a series because I need more of these characters and their friends!
0,Want to read through the Gospels: Matthew, Mark, Luke and John in 31 days? Get a birds eye view of Good news!!	Every day is a short read, taking not much time, but is powerful for all, those who struggle believing, and those who are faithful believers.	May this be a blessing to you as it was for me, growing up with the Gospel stories.  Thank you for this free to me book.
0,The book is incredible and am very please with the characters and their lovemaking such intense passion they share between two people make it seems like they owned there only universe and nothing or  no one except them can enjoy their sexual needs no matter where their locations or who is watching just blow my mind away I mean I wish I could be that brave . The writer  makes this story so believable good for her th story is so sexy and dominate at the same time good read
0,This collection of short stories allows a glimpse into different lives/perspectives as people deal with the zombie outbreak.		Elements of action, compassion, heroism, evil, etc entwine to show how even in times of stress, characters can demonstrate who they are and what they are made of.		Characters are varied, flawed, and have lots to deal with physically and emotionally.		Overall, an intriguing read.
0,Loved it, as I do all Red's books.  I always wanted this to be her choice when she graduated.  You'll never be disappointed reading a book written by Red!
0,I really enjoyed this series just waiting on the 3rd book to be finished
0,I don't usually read short stories but I took a chance and really enjoyed this one.  Rosebud by Vikk Simmons is a slice of life that could be almost any single mothers experience.  Not enough money, kids outgrowing clothes and bills to pay.  And loneliness.  Life as a single parent is not easy as Vikk was able to convey so well with the written word.		Rosebud speaks of loss and adjusting to life after a tragic event and provides a realistic glimpse of life after a loss.  This story is so well written, the reader can almost feel Carlas pain as she tries to find a balance in her new life.  As this story evolves, Carla finds the strength to do what needs to be done with the help of her husbands last gift.  The ending made me smile and cry at the same time.
0,Maeve Benettons younger brother answered an advertisement for a mail-order bride in her name. When the reply came from Patrick Holden in Wyoming, she doesnt know what to do. However, her deceased mother had told her if she ever had a chance to travel, take it. What could it hurt to write him and see what happens. As they correspond, shes very impressed and finally agrees to go west to marry Patrick. However, when she gets there, his brother meets her and says Patrick was called away. As soon as they arrive at the ranch, she begins to realize how many lies Patrick has told her. What in the world is she to do now?		I didn't find any mistakes in the novel, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. However, I do think the ending would have been much stronger without the epilogue.
0,Bravo Pedro Urvi!!	No dejen de leerlo,es atrapante,emocionante,impredecible!!
0,I really hate it when the hurdle to overcome is miscommunication. If the characters had talked there would have been no tension. I get the story building but it was just so unnecessary. I liked the characters, the story was well written. I don't have a problem with any of that. it was the forced "problem" of a stubborn character. it made me not like the character. had me feeling like Eli deserved better. The story still gave me all the good heart squishes. I was just extremely pissed during the middle. not a 5 star rating. more a 3.5
0,I have read all kinds of stories in my life, but this treasure is one of my favorites. This book is raw, real, and unapologetic [if ever the word existed]. It's about a white man name Paul Line who is telling about his life and how he percieves the people in his life. He's a drug addict, he loves black and mixed women, he loves sex, and he absolutely hates to work. Simply put, he is living the way he wants to live, and he doesn't apologize for it. It's not pretty. Sometimes it's even disgusting, but it is an EXCELLENT story, nonetheless.		I will say the grammar is okay. It's based in Europe. So, it may be perfect for our European counterparts. Either way, it didn't deter me from reading because the story is just that good. Kindle formating is perfect. No huge spaces between paragraphs and indentions are fine. Just how I liked it.		I recommend reading this book. It's an eye opening story. Read it with an open mind and see what's it like to be Paul Line.
0,The second prequel short story is even more compelling that the first one.  This time the focuses is on parental love and the child's love of parent.  Countering that is the effect on another couple in which the wife has a deep maternal instinct and the husband has no corresponding paternal ones.  The return of a little girl from war torn Sierra Leone of the 1990s brings closure, love and the end of guilt to one family and the realization of what is missing and eventually the end for another family.  A sweet, profound story, that this time did deal with some issues from a religious angle.  I loved it!  I can't recall if any of these characters are mentioned in the novel; I have a feeling it may have been the priest but it would have only been in passing.  I've pre-ordered the last story in this prequel trilogy and looking forward to it!
0,It would have been nice to have the time frame stretched out a bit but given the nature of the mystery I see why it wasn't. Still... I'm not a HUGE fan of insta-love. Especially for a manwh0re. The bit of twist Savvy throws Kian was nice. But again I wish I had a bit more backstory to that. Maybe with the next book.		~~I volunteered to read an advance copy provided by NetGalley~~
0,Oh my gosh my heart broke again reading this book continuing Tessa and Lucas' romance.  The love/hate is so difficult and the pain and loss between these two is just terrible I was heartbroken.  I was not surprised by the ending and yet it isn't how the story ends...must continue to read on
0,Received from author for an honest review.		Looking back on my Terry Towers books shelf I have read 13 of her books. I've always enjoyed her stories and this is no exception. However, I believe this is the best.		Chase and Tessa are amazing characters together. As individuals I see them as incredible people who have struggled in life but together they are a force of strength and passion. I'm not going to give a synopsis of this book. You can read that everywhere. I'm going to tell you I have found my passion of reading again. I slowed down my reading for personal reasons but Chase and Tessa's story has brought me back. The writing is fantastic, the passion is hot, but the underlined meaning is what is truly the best.		It's a must read!!  Thank you Terry Towers for this opportunity.
0,Dux Bellorum is the excellent third post apocalyptic book in the Future History of America series written by author Marcus Richardson.

0,Omg. Blue done lost her darn mind smh. *picks up jaw from the floor*. I feel sorry for Bella but she seemed obsessed with people especially Ms. Hill and Blue. #crazy. I'd definitely read part 2
0,Really enjoyed this story  There is lots of activity great characters lots of fun, lots of strange things going on.  Looking forward to more
0,Be forewarned, this story is not for the chemically sensitive. It was written with such life-like strokes that I could smell the bleach! I don't know how he did it, but the author managed to write a brilliant story, with fully developed characters and storyline in 13 pages. I can't recommend it enough!
0,Typical 1920's Max Brand western with a convoluted romance, not triangle or even quadrangle but a five sided polygon with the usual confusion in this type of novel. Boy A loves girl A but thinks she loves boy B who thinks he loves girl B who loves boy C. I could go on but I think that description is confusing enough. There is also the little matter that boys A and C are tough and deadly gunmen who are on a collision course. This novel also features a most unpleasant, greedy, conniving, duplicitous and dangerous villain who happens to be girl A's father. There is also a gold mine, love at first sight, reading people by their physical appearances, broad generalizations, etc. I don't think that this is a solid four star novel but under Amazon's rating system, three stars is considered critical and I can't give three and a half stars so four stars it is.
0,I got this book as a free download and I was pleased with the novel.		Heiro was by far the best character in this novel.  It's (Heiro) funny and the writer had my laughing so hard whenever there was a mention of it.		Limbo's Child was funny, entertaining and the plot was good.  However, the downside of the book is that it was a bit overly descriptive and could have had fewer pages.
0,A WONDERFUL ROMANCE.  A GRIPPING STORY OF A WIFE RUNNING IN FEAR FROM HER BRUTAL HUSBAND.  I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN.  A+
0,Wow. Just... wow. That was eerie. THEY is a story about Mike and Taylor and Brian and Kelly, two couples. Mike and Brian are brothers, and Kelly is a city girl. (For the record, I am NOT a city girl.)	They are driving in the snow and run out of gas. Mike gets out of them car and ses lights. "Let's go get some gas," he says to Brian. They bundle up and tell the ladies they'll be back in an hour.	Then: THEY		-Kelly
0,People who write technical manuals should study Samuel Clements' description what he had to learn to become a river boat pilot.  They may discover how to explain a complicated issue.  Teacher's should read it for technique because certainly Mr. Bixby was one of the finest teachers ever.  Anyone interested in the Mississippi life a century nd half ago should read it.
0,I actually really enjoyed this storyline and could say it has a lot of potential to be a great book, with the exception that it is only an installment of the full story. Had I known in advance I would have gotten the box set to read as a whole. Very disappointing but would read this author again but will check ending first
0,Josh Lanyon is a fantastic writer so anything he writes will be great. As this was. I forgot how much I like Will and Taylor, it made me want to go read the other books again. I've forgotten most of their story.... This one is not particularly exciting, it felt more like a beginning to a story. More about the internal drama of Will and Taylor figuring out themselves as a couple, and dealing with Will's family. A nice break in Oregon for some family drama, but no real action. It didn't move their story forward much, other than setting them up financially for the next book. I'm not disappointed exactly, I enjoyed it, but there wasn't a lot of meat to it. Good, but not a great plot.		If you've read the other books you need to read this one, but I'm looking forward to the next more!
0,This series is great. Jessica is interesting and has a life outside of Nathan. Nathan is mysterious and possibly terrible, but we won't know for sure until the third book. This is the kind of cliffhanger that I am down for. This book reads like the very best type of soap opera. The writing is sharp, and Ms. Bladon is an expert at doling out information in small enough increments to make you want to come back for more. I cannot wait for the release of the next book in this series. What does the ending mean???? I am dying to know.
0,Ella with her less than exciting ways and Jake with his more than sexual appeal end up pulling off a story with steam, heat, and music to my ears. A book full of sexual satisfaction and enough discussions about chocolate to make you wonder if you have enough eggs in your fridge. It doesn't last long though because you end up drooling some more over Jake's tattoos. I would totally consider reading this again!
0,I have wanted Amelia's story since I read Danielle Allen's book Work Song. I was hoping she'd get her story and was even more excited that Michelle was writing it. Michelle didn't disappoint me either.		Amelia AKA Lia AKA Noodle is a photographer. She's trying to get her big break. During the day she's working at a gallery and has a 2nd job until she looses it. Luckily for Lia her best friend is there to help her.		Todd is her neighbor who has become best friend with both Lia and Tati. Todd is a chef. Luckily for Lia he gets her a job at the restaurant he's working at. Todd also models for Lia. I mean he is not ashamed of his body. He spends his days at work or at the gym. His Facebook gym selfie posts prove it. The ladies love him and he loves them. But, not too long until he's onto the next one.		Lia is working both jobs while trying to save money to be spotlighted in  a gallery. Todd is trying to save up for  his own restaurant. But, his boss Davis is making things almost impossible. When Todd sees that Davis has a thing for his Noodle he asks his BFF for a favor. Keep Davis busy and maybe Todd can get a little ahead. Lia being his BFF agrees.		Once Davis is in the picture everyone gets confused. Todd's life hasn't been an easy one. It's why he doesn't get close to anyone. Except for Lia. He's gotten close to her family and Tati too. But, not like Noodle. The more Davis and Lia spend together the more he regrets pushing them together. Lia is just as confused. The more she hangs out with Davis the more she's questioning if he's the one. And, the more her mind keeps going to Todd. Then, a conversation with Tati and she's really confused.		Todd is prob one of my favorite guys I read in awhile. He didn't have an easy childhood. Even now with Davis giving him the screw job in all aspects of his life. Todd doesn't let change who he is. He'd do anything for his friends.  Amelia too never let things bring her down or change who she was. There was a bunch of times I'd of flipped if I were her. But, she held onto her own.		Michelle just keeps proving why she's one of my favorites. She always writes characters you can relate too. What I wouldn't do to be invited to Lia's family Sunday dinner. Michelle and Danielle did an excellent job with these BFF's stories.

0,A good mystery wrapped around this love story.	Lindsey arrives on Thistle Bend to open a museum. The Karlsson/Crenshaw feud is one she is tasked with settling. Nobody knows she's related to the Karlsson's, least of all Carden Crenshaw.	Despite their secrets, Lindsey and Carden fall for each other. Unfortunately their secrets come to light and almost ruin their HEA.
0,Loved it
0,This book 1 is pack with HOTNESS! But I love that Raven stands up for her to Van. Oh & the sex.... yowzah!
0,Great book. Would highly recommend it.
0,loved every minute, never go wrong With a dani Collins book
0,This author has away of making her characters so relatable. Nothing over the top, that is what I love about here books. Excellent stories and bringing real issues that people face is great! Get into this author you won't regret it.		Ps. I hate writing reviews.
0,Bounty Hunted love, absolutely better than expected, the fact that this will easy you into to #3 Captured is awesome. The fact that we will see more of Jakob and Kate from book 1  Big Game Hunted Love is outstanding. I want to know how these two couples do!		I loved this book, it is well written romance, the fact it was written by a male author makes it even more intriguing. We know as women how we react in certain intimate situations, but to have a man's point of view regarding a man's reactions to these situations. Let me say, I feel enlightened. Read these books they are well done. Great job, anxiously awaiting captured.
0,I really enjoyed this book.  The plot twists kept me guessing and surprised.  I was sorry when the book was finished because I want to read more about Bea and Edward in their future years.
0,3.5 sweet star		I enjoyed this book a lot!		I woke up on Sunday morning not wanting to get up. I wanted to stay warm in my bed with my kindle and guess what... That's exactly what I did!		It was my first time reading this author and I'm glad I did. Her book is sweet, with not too much drama, with a drop dead gorgeous hero and a girl who know what she is doing even if sometimes she is a little unsure of herself.		What's this book all about?		Meet Jake Baldwin, Sonics baseball player, pretty face, successful with the girls and the heart of his team.	And then meet Nikki Case, independent woman, PR and determined to change the image of the Sonics.		To tease their teammate, Jake's team challenges him to make a move on the young lady and to bring her to fall in love with him. Jake sees no evil and as the girl has already caught his eye, why not?		The approach could have bothered me initially because I thought it wasn't really clever to do this kind of bet. For me it was a bit a childish game they are playing with someone's feelings and I didn't like it. But the author manages to make this go naturally and in a way quite normal.		We fast realize that Jake is very interested in Nikki and that despite the approach is on a bet, the rest of their relationship could be much more serious.		I liked this book so much because it was a smooth and quick read but also because they are a lot of interesting characters involved who are adding a background for further stories. The book is not only about Nikki and Jake but also about a team and their relations.		There are many themes covered throughout the book such as: loyalty, passion, commitment, self-sacrifice, the role and impacts of a sport in the media. Some topics are not discussed in details and where I understand it completely because basically the story is a romance; I wanted certain topics more detailed.		Without giving too much away, Jake takes charge of a little boy because he feels responsible for him and I would have liked for Nikki to be more involved in this. Because sometimes, I had the impression they were two different stories.		This book is the second in the Boys of Summer series and I haven't read the first one. This doesn't bother me, I was able to understand everything, just know that if you don't want to know what happens to Chase, the guy from the first book, I suggest you read the books in the order.		Final Thoughts		The only criticism I could make to this book, it's the age of the characters. If I remember correctly, Jake is 28 years old and that seems a little old for me. The reactions and comments from everyone in general made me think of characters with maximum 23-25 years.	But overall if you are looking for something light, funny, easy to read, take this one
0,Wow! Just finished reading another great book by our Nikki Sex!  I haven't read a bad story from her yet!  Loved the characters in this book. The story was great. Alittle dark but with a whole lot of love and light. Really enjoyed it!
0,In order to achieve what you want you need to not only train your body but your mind, which is vital. Once you train your mind you can break through anything, This story was very inspiring and is a great story to understand and read.
0,Imogenia, a murdered heiress, seeks to avenge her death by placing a curse on both her murderous brother and the kingdom he rules. Power of the Heir's Passion is the story of how and why the curse was placed. This is the basis of the subsequent stories that follow in this Middle Grade fantasy adventure.		Power of the Heir's Passion is a quick read full of witty humor. The place called, Afterlife, is particularly clever, with all the amusing character names (Patty Amnul, social committee, and Sine Ster, Deputy Undersecretary, Hades) and destinations (Unfinished Business Office, Peace Paradise).  This is a very good beginning to the series. Recommended for readers ages eight and up.
0,I loved the first book with "Nicole and Danny" and was pleasantly surprised to see a continuation to there story. I don't want to give to much away so I'll just say if you haven't read the first book "Scared for Life"  I then recommend you read the first book or if you have it, go ahead and refresh yourself with the first book and then read this one... I love these characters and hope there's more to there story. Perhaps another book "Scared book 3" ?
0,I really liked the way Harlow just did whatever she thought was rite even when she was wrong! I love the whole family of witches and types of witches i didn't ever know existed, very real and lots of weird going on cant wait to read the second book in the series. Recommend to anyone that likes a good mystery with some danger and suspense!
0,Five-star-read-in-every-way.
0,Nice and ver attractive characters.  In many ways, a very realistic portrayal of spoilt, rich young lady.  Thankfully, no extremely evil villains.  More I try to analyze it,more I like it.  Only negative, was the long-drawn pages of what each of the two protagonists were thinking in between dialog;skipped several such pages.
0,A really sweet love story. The first-person narratives by both boys sound authentic. They do sound a little young -- I was surprised when they made reference to being seniors in high school.		The book was on the short side, but just long enough to tell its story. I recommend it to anyone willing to read a story about two gay teens coming to self awareness together.
0,Bites started it all! I read First Moon and was so happy to revisit with Tao, Kai and Leo and of course Audrey and learn how they started their new pack of humans turned werewolves. To learn how their lives started to knit together after so much hate and prejudice made them leave their pack.		I also loved reading how Kane and Charlotte came together, the funny as well as the hard times they had to overcome to finally become a couple.		I recommend you read this story and then if you haven't already, read First Moon it is awesome!
0,Bad Boy Fire Bear is my first book by Bella Love-Wins.  This is a well written short read, a good choice for those with limited time for reading.  Bella Love-Wins has delivered lots of drama, action and spice to keep the pages flipping.  Jax and Joleen's story is fast paced with fun characters.  I enjoyed this book and look forward to reading more from Bella Love-Wins in the future.  Bad Boy Fire Bear is book 1 in the Marked Bear Shifter Series but can be read as a standalone.  This is a compete book, not a cliff-hanger.
0,Really liked this story. Good love story. Enjoyed learning about the brothers.
0,TWISTED (Dark Protectors) by Rebecca Zanetti	Publication Date: June 20, 2013	Reviewed by: Reading In Pajamas/ Cori	Rated: 4.5 Stars		REVIEW:	Twisted is a continuation of Rebecca Zanettis Dark Protector series. This book can be read as a stand alone, but I recommend reading the series in order to enjoy the full story. I absolutely loved Twisted! It is a quick novella read, but still gives you a complete story. Maggie has amnesia as a result of the testing and experimentation inflicted on her by the Kurjans. She has no memory of her life before 10 years ago and for 10 years Terrent has waited for Maggie to regain her memory and remember him. Terrent left her in the care of the Kyrs thinking it was the best thing to do for her, but he knows she belongs with him and to him as his mate. Now she is has been sent by the Kyrs to him and and he is determined to get his mate back. I loved Terrent, the sexy alpha werewolf with a brogue. I love that Maggie meets his alpha tendencies head on and stands up for herself. She also isn't afraid to fight for what she wants. When Maggie and Terrent come together they have smoldering passion. This story has a great plot with lots of twists and turns, lots of action, great characters and plenty of steamy romance. I highly recommend this book and this series to all paranormal romance lovers!		*Received an ARC from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.		http://wp.me/p3d0RZ-bY	https://www.facebook.com/ReadingInPajamas	http://readinginpajamas.wordpress.com	http://www.goodreads.com/readinginpajamas	Twitter: @readingpajamas
0,Loved it. So much drama and action.  Jake is so gorgeous.  Lee Ann is cute.  The sex is great.  Was too short, but I had already read "Eternal Breath of Darkness" and Exquisite Breath of Darkness".  These guys are so HOT!!!
0,I am bias here because I love Lisa books but I can frankly say here I had no clue the book was gonna end the way it did.  I had a totally different suspect that I thought was the stalker.  I have already preordered the next one that's how much I love this series
0,Jasmine had a lot of growing up to do that she managed to do after becoming a mother.  There was a lot of open questions unanswered at the end.  Such as the sister-in-law's animosity, Jasmine's parents alienation and the panties that didn't belong to the wife.  Great love story.
0,I couldn't put this down, wanted to find out id Dylan and Zoe got back together and if he would find out about his baby/kid. Oh wow, great read!
0,I found this little gem on KindleScout and was thrilled when it was one of the books selected. The setting is in Texas and the h, Ana White, is a loveable character. She believes herself lucky when her boss takes a shine to her. He woos her and is all that is charming that is until she tells him she is pregnant. He not only lets her go but sees to it no one else will hire her. She finds herself back home in Bandera, Texas on the same ranch she grew up on. Her father now passed it is just her and her mother as her sister Celia is getting married. But they are not alone, her mother tells her of the handyman she's taken on to help fix things around the ranch.		Ryan Black is the perfect man to fix more than just the ranch. I liked the fact that there was no doubt in his mind that once he met and spoke with Ana he knew she was the woman for him. Now while she is scared and lost he is her guiding light out of the darkness. I loved the relationship between the two and even when he discovers she is pregnant he doesn't even flinch. He knew she was the one and let nothing shake his determination to obtain her. So gentle, protective and understanding, fighting his own urges to prove to her that she could trust him. There is only one problem. He is hiding a secret and it is not until 3 quarters of the book that Ana learns what it is.		I would have liked to see him tell her himself but than it would have ruined other things that took place later so it all worked out for me. The other issue I noticed was the first part of the book had issues with quotation marks. It would be just the ending quotation marks instead of the beginning and ending ones. You will not have any problem determining who is saying what but it is still worth mentioning because it was a bit distracting. The writing and spelling is great no problem there. There are love scenes one I'd like to label as, " Skype loving. "  I really found the overall feel of the book gentle and romantic.
0,First time reading a menage book and it was written very well.  I enjoyed it and would like to see more from this author.  Waiting for a book two to this story.
0,This is an interesting story about a vampire enforcer (e.g. police officer/ investigator/ assassin) and a seemingly straightforward situation that steadily becomes more complicated.
0,This was good hood reading, I can't wait for the next book, to see who live or die,  this was a great res d
0,What a mix, men,a men's game of rugby,and Romance! Kat Latham,never lets us down when romance is in the mix!!! I am totally in love with this series!!! I would highly recommend it!!!  It's great to see fresh new writing skills! Fresh new storylines,with awesome twists!!! I so love the sport of Rugby for so many reason. I Thank the Authors who have brought Rugby here in America to the forefront!!!
0,I loved Emma and Cole's story and this book about leyla and Ben didn't disappoint. I couldn't put it down read it in one day. Can't wait for the third one
0,This is Lori and Bruno's story. They are both dealing with difficult situations. Lori's world turned upside down with the fact her husband cheated and what he said to her. Bruno is dealing with the death of his mate. Each has a child they are razing. Can they deal with their losses and still find real happiness? What will happen to bring them together?		I received this free copy from the Author for an honest review.
0,That damn Jayceon is wow . Ceanna definitely deserves betta . This the true definition of don't trust females around your man . Excellent story
0,This short book is a very entertaining collection of typical Facebook status updates that you could probably find by scrolling down your wall. However,when compiled in this format, they offer a good amount of chuckles. Many of the posts are funny quotes that I had previously seen on Facebook (some I've seen a ton of times) but overall the content is varied enough to make anyone smile.		This is a decent read if you are in need of a mood booster. Only took off 1 star due to length (it is very short) and spelling / grammar mistakes (which were probably part of the original posts,but nevertheless made reading a little more tedious).
0,I have been an avid fan of Sci-Fi for over 50 years. I do not remember a story line quite like this one. All the Wizard Scout story needs is fleshing out a bit and we will have a good one to follow, on to the next in the series. All in all a good read.
0,These books were awsome...i love Cam and Canan. I just hope Avery don't get killed off. Waiting on pt 3
0,I really enjoy every single novel that I read from this author. This series has captivated me with its characters and storyline.
0,I love the Rogue Novella's and this one did not disappoint.  It was like coming home.  Each time I read these I visit the people I met in the previous novellas.  Mystery, suspense, snafus its all happening and your right there with them.  An enjoyabIe read!
0,Very different storyline. Dragons are very angry at humans. They have been locked out of their homelands for decades and now they're back. Some want to live in peace with the humans, some want just to be left alone to live where humans don't live and some want revenge with a capital R, Humans are
0,I liked how the story is continuing but each book is from another couples point of view.  You will need to read books one through 4 first.
0,It took forever for this to be released. But overall the book was pretty good, just very confusing at certain parts. Also feel this should have been the final installment, it's beginning to drag on.
0,I loved this book. The characters. The fairy tales. The way the stories and people intertwine. The imagination. It's emotional, funny and complex. Like life. Man Called Ove was very good. Beartown was ok. Grandmother was terrific.  Worth the very long wait from the library.
0,this book gives surprising information on a subject not often heard about. Serial killers are often assumed to be men.  This book gives an overview of women who kill, how and why.
0,Bound by Bliss is the third Lavinia Kent novel Ive read, and all have been terrific. My favorite chapter featured a funny, sweet scene where the virginal heroine, Bliss, inspects her naked fianc, Stephan, head to toe in painstaking detail.		Thank you, she whispered, as her tongue continued to play, tasting, licking, laving.	For what? His voice was almost a growl.	For not letting me miss knees. I must confess that I would have quite overlooked them on my own. A definite jerk of his whole body overtook him.	I think you would have figured it out when I have my turn. I can promise that I will not overlook them.	She certainly hoped not.		Character development was good, writing was solid as weve come to expect from Kent, all in all a great read. Download it, enjoy it. 5 stars.		*ARC via netgalley*
0,Wow this book is full of interesting information.  I liked the nice simple approach to the book and the explanations are easy to understand.  Sometimes these books go way over my head with all the technical, scientific terms, but this book is not like that at all.	I often skip meals and know understand it does more harm than good.	Interesting and informative read, recommended
0,I picked up A Ghost Went Trick or Treating by A.J. Cosmo (written under the penname Gene Wilikers) on Amazon.com. As of the date of this blog, it is available for a free download. My best recommendation is to grab a copy while it is still availableotherwise, it will run you $1.99, which is still a bargain!		At only 22 pages and 12 illustrations, it is a short read, but one your child will delight in. It is the perfect tale to get young ones excited about the upcoming holiday, read after a long night of trick-or-treating or as a classroom read aloud on Halloween day.		What I enjoyed about this story is that I thought I had it all figured out, until nearly the end, when the author threw in a twist that made me smile. How many times can you say that as an adult, a child's book throws you a curve? It goes to prove that a well-written children's book can surprise us all.		The best part is that I love stories that have a message or lesson within them. This one is presented so perfectly, your child will not recognize it for what it is, but will find themselves engaged and immersed in the unfolding events.		This book teaches children about:	friendship	bullying	not to judge a "book" by its cover	helping others	This is a book that I look forward to sharing with my young nieces. I have no doubt it will win their seal of approval as well.
0,Enjoyed reading this book. Got really super tired of the constant reference by the hero and heroine of her "cookie" . Man talk about overkill!  Just felt like there relationship was based on how super soaking wet her "cookie" could get from his touch. I love hot sex as much as the next person but the vulgarity of that term can be off putting at times	..This author has Sandra Brown romance/suspense type potential...if she could just tame down all the sex. The hero comes off more like an Neanderthal than and alpha male...he just made it seem that the only reason women exist is to fulfill his manly urges and procreate...there's nothing particularly sexy about that. Anyhoo, good writing..suspenseful in its own way...don't feel the romance..that needs work...and this author can tell a good story.
0,Very exciting story!!!	Danielle and William seems so wrong for each other, so different	She is a firefighter he is an accountant	But they have more like that they think.	Just read it!!!!
0,I am just such a huge fan! I am always looking for what this author has written for us! She is a fast writer by not fast enough! More BBW'S and HEA'S please!!!
0,I enjoyed this book and the way the author kept the story going to the end. I will be looking for more from the author.
0,Elizabeth writes a great story... You will enjoy this as much as all her others...
0,I love reading books with 2 guys and 1 woman. Throw in the imagination of another world and you have me hooked every time.
0,Even though I have read and really enjoyed the authors other books, I had held off reading "Quarantine" because I saw in the description the words, science fiction, aliens, and mutants. Sci-Fi is not a genre that I enjoyed, that is until now! I loved this book, in fact this may very well be my favorite book of his! I was hooked within the first few pages, there is so much packed into this book, all of the descriptions of the area, the various characters, etc.. are incredibly vivid, it's like you are right there seeing, hearing and smelling it all. It has been a true page turner, I found it very difficult to stop reading it, my dishes need washed and I told myself just one more page, that one page then turned into 2 pages, then 3 pages. Needless to say, my dishes didn't get done that night! So even if you don't think this is a genre that you will enjoy, give it a try. I think you will be pleasantly surprised like I was. What a gem of a book!
0,Always go for your dreams. Sometimes they don't developed right away, but eventually they will be there. Sometimes they happen when you least expect them.
0,Great story. Love getting to know more about the Morgans. Fell for Brandt in Coral Hearts, then getting to know Ryan. Joelle is one lucky girl. Another wonderful story and I can't wait for more.
0,The emotions of accepting oneself and making the final leap out of the closet.		The giving of oneself and showing your love.
0,I've Nicole Edwards book so much I just can't wait for the next one. This one had all my favorite characters back in some action that was too hot for print.
0,I enjoyed this book, I like reading about the 1800's or early 1900's just simple easy reading nothing that requires a lot of concentration.  The story could have gone on a little longer, more about courtship and marriage.
0,The book was an ok read for me, because I really didn't know the background story with Sophie and Tony. Some parts of the story didn't make since because of that fact. I think that if I would have read the other books before this one I would have enjoyed this more. Overall the love between the two is amazing.
0,This book answers a few of the question the reader might have about Christian. Looking forward to reading the next 2 books from his POV
0,This book here has me hooked so bad! I really enjoyed it it has all the feels ! I highly recommend!  I haven't read alot of paranormal romance yet and this being my first menage one I didn't know how I was going to react ,but I am head over heels in love with this story and want more ! The characters , plot and storyline was great . I am ready to read more by this author . Thank You . Definite hot read ! No spoilers ! Read it !
0,There are so many things to say about this book!!! But the most important thing is to just read this book!!! This is just one you need to feel and experience in order to appreciate all that it is!!!!
0,I had  read another short story by this author, and upon recommendation from the same friend who loved Run, Ronny, Run! grabbed this one during a free giveaway. Lots was going on around my home, but when I finally got around to reading Angela of Troy, I could not put it down.		Do yourself a favor and pick almost any of Gilmore's books to see how super talented this author just happens to be.  There's something indescribable about his writing, but his subtle wit, vivid imagery, and laid back style bring his delightfully different stories to life.		Right out of the gate Gilmore will hook you with his fascinating prose. He is like a singer who has such a unique voice, you love whatever song they sing. But his stories are as unique as his prose, which is why you will enjoy every line he writes.		For a short story, Mr. Gilmore packs a punch, however it is tough to really sink into characters as magical as those from his creative mind, therefore I was left slightly whiney, wanting to read more. So, I will reiterate what others say about this one. When the end was near I was almost begging: "I want to read more about Angela!"		If you are looking for great, character driven short stories that spring from worlds much different than what you know, please try Gilmore. His characters will stick with you even after you've closed your Kindle, and the only disappointment you might feel is the brevity of his tales.
0,Every time Lisa B Kamps writes a hockey romance, she SHOOTS, she SCORES and this one is no exception.  Shoot out is filled with heat and hockey players so it already has two things going for it!  Throw in an opposites attract story with Mat and Nichole and the story is off the charts.  Good guy Mat breaks free of his 'perfect' image and has a one night stand, but he can't stop the feeling that it could have been more.  Nichole has had a past relationship that turned out to hurt her physically and emotionally and isn't willing to just trust anyone.  These two both have their issues to work through, but they may just be the best things that happened to each other.  This Banners series is soooo good and I have loved every single one of them!  The characters are multi-dimensional and seem so very real.  The stories keep your interest throughout!
0,Wonderful light read.  I really appreciate the views expressed by the characters in regards to horse care & the show world.  Horses are individuals not objects & that is a valued sentiment expressed in the series
0,This is the story of fwo guys living next door to each other in an apartment building.  Mason had recently moved into this apartment and was recovering from a past relationship.  Completely oblivious to life around him.  Avery, his neighbor, kept an eye on him.  This back and forth attraction was a nice lead up to what happens when they finally act on it.		The story is well written.  There were a few light hearted moments with the parents.  Avery is such a sweet thoughtful guy even if he's this high powered lawyer.  And Mason is special in his own way.  The romance aspect was well done.  While the sex was understandable at first, when it kept going on and on it became filler to me and easily skipped.  I would have liked to hear something about the men in their careers instead of everything told second hand.  We only get a glimpse of Avery's work office and a meeting with a client.  Mason only edits at home, his job and office and co-workers aren't even touched on.  - Dan's Wife
0,Oh my the twists and turns. This series just keeps getting better and making it harder for me to be a functional part of society. I'm addicted! Shade is subjected to even more but has also gotten more powerful. And it seems the triangle will be no more. We also get to meet some new characters that seem very promising. Can't wait to read Cursed and Ever Wrath.
0,I liked seeing the burnout series from Vegas' prospective compared to reading it from the guy's prospective.  It was interesting and kept my interest throughout the read.  I have not been disappointed by Dahlia West books, all of them have been great reads and I look forward to future books by this author.
0,This is a standalone book told from Lincoln and Aubrie/Brie's points of view. Although we saw a lot of Lincoln's humor and charm, there was an added layer of depth to his character. With Aubrie, he can be himself, Lincoln, and not the extreme base jumping persona he's famous for, "Based." It's obvious Brie and Lincoln will have their HEA by the end of the book. In the meantime, Ms. Hamel takes you through the highs and lows as they come to terms with their relationship. Oh, and Cliff? He is definitely not getting a father's day card or tie anytime soon.		I received a copy of this story from the author for an honest review (thank you!).
0,Another good read in this series.  After fighting to win Alabama and gain her trust Christoper acts like the biggest jerk alive.  He has to work his ass off to win back Alabama.  I enjoyed this couple and the story.  No military action  in this story but more about character and how can lose true love when you don't take care of it.  I enjoyed reading this story.  Definitely worth a read.
0,I gave this novella four stars.  It was typical Lori Foster.  I don't know of any other author who can write such a satisfying short story.  Even though you hate that it is over, you feel like you know the characters and their stories well.  I liked both characters.
0,Mistletoe in Montana: A Christmas Novella is by Belle Calhoune.  This is a sweet little novel about a second chance at love.	Brenna Santiago had left Merry, Montana and her family eight years ago to try to make it in Hollywood.  She became engaged to Luke Templeton before she left.  However, it wasn't long before she broke that engagement to marry Hank Slade, a wealthy producer in Hollywood.

0,I love the story of Ivy and Cy, it was wonderful and you could almost see them falling in lust AND LOVE.  I read the other reviews and I can agree with them to an extent.  There were some mistakes, "surreal" was a word used but surreal was not a word until a few years ago.  We expect our authors to write like Jane Austin who lived in that era.  I think the grandmother was the perfect character.  She came across as very authentic from that time period.  She was  presented with a very distasteful situation of having to take care of two "bastard" granddaughters she knew nothing about and learned to love them.  Good story and I enjoyed it!
0,Bounty by Elise Sax is full of adventure, action, humor and romance with some strong sexual tension between Abby Williams and Iain Brodie.	Abby is likeable,sassy, feisty and so compassionate, funny but often clueless and when she is nervous she talks non-stop.  She often acts first and then thinks it out later. Iain is tall, dark, handsome, powerful and dangerous.  Abby tells him that she thinks of him as "Superman". He is former SAS and is currently a mercenary.  They meet in the first chapter and he is the strong and silent alpha hunk. Readers will find out that he is so much more as the story progresses.	And at the end, oh my, he was so charming and funny.  "You think I can't say 'I love you". You think my mouth will blow up".  Elise, you do know how to write those alpha males.		The plot is well thought out, filled with twists and turns and laugh out loud humor.  Elise takes the reader from Africa, to Eastern Europe, England and New York and never slows down. This book is fun, often hilarious, and over the top with action and world wide intrigue. Once I started it, I couldn't put it down!  If you are looking for romance, intrigue, danger and humor, then this would be perfect reading.
0,Very nice read, kept me coming back for more and if you get your reader to do that then you are onto a winner, well done David.
0,This is one series that I hope never ends. These characters steal your heart a little more with each book and with every new character we meet.		The best part about this series.... You feel like your reading about actual people. The drama and story lines are crazy ridiculous that that could only happen in books. These characters feel real and with each new book they develop even more.		I have truly enjoyed the addition of Hazel and Flynn and love her underdog story. I would love to read some of Flynn's POV, especially since he mentioned a plan for proposing!!!!		Can't wait for #17!!!!
0,Jessie and Grayson spent a night together a year ago that neither of them can forget. They both want a repeat, but Jessie is afraid that her heart will be broken. Grayson thinks by selling of the romance part of his publishing company that he can forget Jessie for good. Their night together now changes everything and they realize how hard it is to walk away. This was a good quick read!
0,Like these books so well, I am trying to figure out the sport of hockey. I'm from the South and HATE ice but these books set "on the ice" are HOT.	Love it. Anybody know where I can get a hockey tutor to actually watch a game now?
0,As I read more about the dragon's kin, I become most enthralled with their family. I have enjoyed and respected each member of the family. Braith has shown her own strength and overcame her father's disregard for her worth. I can relate to her struggle and each woman who has been undermined by men.
0,You are a good author, but you need to leave your view of the truth of Jesus being the savior, His years of miracles and His crucifixion and resurrection to yourself! This isn't just upsetting but I in my low opinion consider it blasphemy
0,I give this book 5 stars		First let me collect my feelings and heart from the floor. These two reminded me of a line in a country song that says: I'm a lover and you're a runner. Samuel and Mackenzie are so relatable.		This story is based on the 36 questions to fast track love experiment by Arthur Aron. Mackenzie meets Samuel one night and they hit it off. She tells him about these 36 questions. Problem is both of them are very closed off and have had traumatic experiences in their childhood.		This book takes you on their journey and each time they meet they ask a few questions here and there. Mackenzie is very resistant to love yet she's a strong independent woman. She doesn't need a man to make her whole she makes herself whole. Samuel is a successful man and content with his life with his ever present dog Rocky. Drama does ensue so its not all relationships and love.		I admired this book. It was such an interesting concept. I was genuinely invested into where this was going. How these questions were going to be incorporated and she pulled it off effortlessly. It even made me stop and ask my husband some questions. So if you're looking for a insightful read and a sweet tumultuous love story then read this. Caution: It is written in Australian slang, which kind of threw me for a loop but it was easy to look past. Minor problem for a pretty book.
0,This was my first ever Abigail Barnette novel and I was delighted it is well-written, but surprised it is a May/December novel.  The heroine is the heros junior by 24 years. That made me pause. But the more I read, the more I liked it, and I forgot the age difference. The main and secondary characters, the pacing, the chemistry, the tension, the overall storyline are all really well done.  I like both the hero and the heroine and cant fault them. And if you are looking for a steamy romance, youll get it here.		This is not a standalone and I didn't know it going in. Thats my fault because I didn't research.  Its one of six, (yes SIX novels SO FAR) not including a prequel novella.  I don't know that I have the stamina for that many books about one couple, but here, the build-up to the cliffhanger and the cliffhanger itself was expertly done and my heart is currently aching wondering how the heroine and hero will handle the next stage of their lives. I'm looking forward to the second book.		My recommendation is: if you can get over the age difference, navigate through the sexual athleticism, and the fact of the cliffhanger ending, youll enjoy this novel.		I liked this authors writing so much I looked for some stand-alones/shorter series to read and found plenty I can choose from.
0,Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down. Smart and funny with laugh out loud moments. A strong woman's story with men who are human, not the heroes of the story.	I'll be starting the next one soon. I can't wait for Howard's story.
0,I really enjoyed this novella! Dominic and Chloe have finally reconnected, but the past still stands in their way. Dominic has always been in love with Chloe and would move mountains to be with her. Chloe has become a strong, independent woman who is wholly dedicated to her charity work. Dominic is determined to finally have Chloe, but both are unsure of the other, stubborn, and have very set ideas. Griffin and Justine were great as secondary characters.		I would recommend at least reading Lost in a Royal Kiss (#0.5) to get the backstory for the relationship between Dominic and Chloe, but you could read it as a standalone.
0,This is a book about how Stephanie gets her life back after having her heart broken by the two people closest to her and how when she feels she's found happiness, shades of her past rise up and threaten to destroy what peace and happiness she's found.		I would have liked this book more if it had been a little longer. It's a large print book and comes in under 135 pages. But it's a sweet story written by a great author!
0,I'M NOT PERFECT AND IT'S OKAY!	IS AN INSPIRATION FOR ALL.	Delores Ayotte has once more written a touching and poignant book filled home spun down to earth wisdom. She shares her personal journey through depression and her triumph over it. Retracing her steps to forgive herself and those around her while accepting the fact no one is perfect, not even her.	Delores true gift is wisdom and her ability to share it through conversational writing that is easy to follow. Her writing style is smooth and simple, yet immensely inspirational. Delores continues to provide must reads for every home. I give it five stars because the scale doesn't go to six! Everyone should buy this book!

0,Pretty good offering, left me wanting the next installment.  Taking a bit of a shine to one of the new characters, and I'm hoping one of the other new ones gets close to a faulty airlock.
0,Refreshingly unique, Landry Park combines the historical and the futuristic into a beguiling tale of romance, changing values, and rebellion. All Madeline ever wanted was to go to university rather than getting married and running the Landry estate. David Dana, bringing with him a realization of the oppression of the rootless, is about to change Madeline's life as well as her future ambitions. Enter Jude MacAvery to complicate matters even more and bring about a carefully crafted love triangle.		The author skillfully places a typical Victorian romance in a dystopian futuristic setting. Think ball gowns, lady's maids and debutants in a world that is mainly run by nuclear power; a world which is divided into classes with the lowest class, the rootless, getting a very raw and dangerous deal.		The characters in Landry Park are well crafted and complex enough to make the book really interesting. Madeline, the main character, has a balanced variety of weaknesses and strengths to make her a truly realistic female lead. She struggles with her values and ambitions and must make choices despite her prejudiced gentry upbringing.		David Dana, on the other hand, is a total enigma. Right up to the end I couldn't really decide whether he was a hero, a rebel, or simply a weakling. As for handsome, gallant Captain Jude MacAvery completely astonished me in the end.		Starting with an attack on Cara, one of the gentrys girls, Landry Park is full of scenes of action, violence, tragedy and nail-biting suspense. Towards the end of the book several mysteries are cleared up while new mysteries are created which, hopefully, will be cleared up in the sequel. Suitable for readers of all ages, I highly recommend Landry Park as a beautiful tale of romance, human values, and a great deal to keep the reader's adrenalin flowing. (Ellen Fritz)
0,These short stories are all by good writers, several whom I already follow, like Terri Reid, Dale Mayer and Rose Pressey. While reading this compilation, I took time off to read a book by one of the authors I hadn't read before. This is a great way to learn about new authors. And those of us who read a lot always have to find new ones when we go thrue so many books so quickly.
0,SnowBoy (X-Treme Bys #5) by Kay Manis	4 Stars		We first met Geneva in SkaterBoy when she was an absolute biatch to Hindley, over the series she has had quite a prominent role. We have seen her do some horrendous things in her bid to steel Rory away and we watched as she had a change of heart and worked hard to earn the forgiveness of her family and friends.		I never really liked her, nor did I believe the complete turnaround in her personality, I kind of think a leopard cant change its spots so have been quite cynical towards Geneva and her nice side, I keep waiting for the old her to reappear.		In SnowBoy, while away for Dana & Peters wedding (of sorts as they are already married), Geneva meets Berk whose family owns the resort where they are staying. They are instantly attracted to each other, but Berks tragic past holds him back from completely letting himself feel for Geneva and her insecurities; caused by her own history, keep her from seeing them as anything other than a holiday romance.		Im not disappointed by this book, even though I have rated it less than any other book in the series, I just don't feel it holds a candle to either Hindley and Rorys story or Dana and Peters. I fell in love with Rory from the off, which made it easy for me to fall in love with their story and Dana is such a colourful character that her tale had to be interesting. Geneva and Berk just didn't have that kick for me, and I found them a little flat.	This is still a great romantic read and Kay Manis is an author with immense talent, I cant wait for the next book and the conclusion to the X-Treme Boys series.		Copy supplied for review as part of a tour
0,Many thanks to Sloan Storm, who provided a free copy of Slipperless in exchange for an honest review.		This is the fifth and final installment of the Slipperless series, and Im glad to say, my favorite of the five.		The Fiona that returns to Hawkins Biotech in this book is an irrevocably changed woman.  She is still dealing with events from the previous book, but instead of being broken by her grief, she has become stronger for it.  She takes back the reins of the lab, and makes some sweeping changes.  She surprises herself, Gabe, and her lab team with her decisions.  I cheered, she should have done this long ago, but lacked the confidence.  She maintains her strong stance to her coworkers, making her standards stick.  Her relationship with Gabe is her only weak point, and she soons finds herself back in his arms.		How does Gabe react to the new Fiona?  You might be surprised  Gabe is used to getting exactly what he wants, but this Fiona tests both his patience and his control.  Her work is flawless, her attitude is surprising, and Gabe has to decide if he can live with or without her in his life.		Occasionally during the course of this series, I have wanted to grab both Gabe and Fiona, and shake some sense into them.  I have never seen too more stubborn characters, who never do exactly what you expect them to. I was happy to witness Fionas growth as a person, and I can honestly say that Ive become genuinely fond of Gabe.  Ive enjoyed this series and look forward to this authors next work.
0,Great
0,I really enjoyed this book. Some very creepy things occur, and the main characters are great. It left me wondering what if everything we wrote about did happen? That's a chilling idea
0,Independent Reviewer for Paranormal Romance and Authors that Rock		I give it 4 fangs		Wanting It All, by Kati Wilde, is the first book in the series The Hellfire Riders MC.  Because of the violence and graphic sex, I highly suggest this book for mature adults only.		Jenny was attacked and almost raped five years ago by a member of the Eighty-Eights.  And her savior, Saxon, was sent to jail because he unintentionally killed her attacker.  Since that day Jennys heart has belonged to Saxon.  Unfortunately, Jenny is the daughter of the Titans leader and Saxon is the president of the Hellfire Riders.  Since his release from prison Saxon hasn't shown any interest in Jenny and she doesnt let on that she feels anything for him.  When a third gang, the Eighty-Eights comes looking for payback from Jenny, Saxon steps in to be her savior again.  But can she let him be more and does he want more than just sex from her?		If you like biker stores with some really steamy sex scenes, then I suggest this book.  The book is a novella that can be easily read in one setting and has no cliffhanger.
0,This is a story with biblical origins about the Nephilim and prophesies about them.  The Nephilim are the descendents of Fallen Angels and they have organized into Houses (families) who hide their origins from humans. The Phoenix was the leader of these houses but disappeared without a successor hundreds of years ago. There are representatives from these Houses that serve to protect others from evil and their Watchers who direct their efforts.		The reader is immediately dropped into the action with a death and introduction of a demon.that eats souls. The story itself and our introduction to the characters builds more slowly and takes time to develop and engage. You slowly meet the members of the team and their Watchers.  Aiden McLachlan is finishing her graduate studies in languages. She has been raised by one of the Watchers. His health is deteriorating and he begins to reveal secrets he has kept from her. He also requests that his friend assist her when he passes. His friend is one of the most intriguing characters with a long history and many secrets of his own. The information her father shares with her, leads her to more questions than answers.  She has to make difficult decisions about who she can and should trust. Her future is destined to be very different that she expected.		I found the author to be very original in her creation of this storyline and its characters. It did take me a little while to really feel immersed in the story. I think it is because the reader doesn't meet Aiden at the very beginning and is introduced to other major characters from several other characters' points of view.  I felt somewhat distanced by the use several of the other characters in describing important elements of the plot. Each character does have their secrets, so I do understand why that technique was used. For me, I would have preferred being introduced to Aiden and then meeting the other characters and seeing their stories come to light. I think Aiden is the most approachable character. Once she became the main narrator of the story, I felt connected to the story.		I enjoyed reading the story and definitely recommend it to those interested in an original storyline with intriguing characters. The characters are not as clearly good and bad as seen in many stories. They are more ambiguous in terms of their character. It makes for an interesting read. I received a copy from the author in return for a honest review.
0,I was given this book in exchange of an honest review. Autumn Storm was equally as enjoyable as the first book Dark summer, I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen. It starts off the same way as Dark Summer except this time is more than just one person getting off the bus. I coulnd't wait to read what would happen next, what discoveries would be made, what memories Autumn would have, which at times it was so frustrating lol because you want so hard for her to remember everything! And then there's Summer's ghost who keeps appearing from time to time, it was awesome!!! The reunion  with the elememnts who appeared as Summer and Tarzan to finally show Autumn the truth was an emotional encounter beyond more words than I could use to describe it, all I can say is that it was beautiful. And then soon after that, the reunion with Decker was also emotional. I am now anxiously awaiting for book 3 and 4 in the series. Can't wait!!! Thank you so much.
0,This is a very creative book that was also fun to read. I highly recommend it.
0,JL is awesome. Really, but she's killing me with cliffhangers!  Why oh why, I don't know if I want to strangle Charlie or push her outta my way to get to her entourage. I NEED book 4 soon, so J.L better be working on it!	But seriously, this one is just as good as the first two. I was slightly disappointed in a decision but I have a feeling Nikko will fix that up himself.	Thank you J.L Clayton for a fabulous book 3.
0,This book is great and filled with the word of God!
0,This was a well written read/listen. It has interesting characters and a quick moving storyline. It flows nicely with some nice twists. It is probably the most adult themed book I have read by this author. She once again proved that she is talented enough to write in multiple genres, and cover the bases from very sweet to smoking hot! Great job!
0,Nelle's story telling never fails to amaze me. I read Trainwreck 1 and 2 back to back and did not stop until I finished. I received an ARC for an honest review but I would've bought these books even if I didn't. Read it and enjoy
0,An emotional touching tale of rediscovering strength, hope, love, second chances, and beauty. I have read several books from Gina Gordon but in her newest release, Naked, Ms. Gordon went beyond a typical love story. She stripped her readers naked and in such allowed them to really feel. Feel the hopelessness, the loss, the guilt, the insecurity and the vulnerability of being exposed.		Shed wanted him. That much was obvious. But he got the impression she wasn't accustomed to being the aggressor. So maybe it was time that someone taught her how to take what she wanted.		Naked was truly one of those reads that reminded you that each one of us are vulnerable to our fears. Fears that can inhibit us from truly living life. And for Violet Walker, her insecurity and fears were skin deep and beyond. After a fatal car crash that left her fiance dead and her alive, Violet struggles with guilt. He died and she lived. She should be thankful that she is alive but the scars ridden on her body has made her fearful, insecure, and afraid. The scars were just a reminder to her that she may have a beautiful face but her upper half of her body was damaged with scars. So when she meets her sexy next door neighbor, for the first time, Violet felt a spark. A spark that could only be ignited by the presence of Noah Young.		Noah was aware that Violet was attracted to him and that she was hiding something since she was always wearing clothes to cover her neck and upper body. As Noah and Violet begin a sexual relationship, Violet makes it known to Noah that he can't touch her upper body and that this sexual fling is temporary nothing serious. After a few weeks into their fling, they decided to part ways. But as it turns out, fate has a funny way of working out since Violet discovers that her Noah is the Noah Young hired to help construct her family's construction project. As the newly appointed CEO of her family's business, how will Violet react to discovering that Noah is one of her employees? And will Violet be able to strip down and show Noah how she truly feels about him? Can Noah finally see the real Violet? When it comes to love, can Violet finally be naked?		Their sexual encounters kept getting hotter. More urgent. And technically, they hadnt even been fully naked. But nakedness was overrated when the need for another human being was so great you were willing to do anything just to hear your name on their lips.		I found Naked by Gina Gordon an enjoyable read. There are times where I felt it was a bit tad slow but I understood that author wanted to showcase that stripping yourself bare emotionally and physically takes time. Each one of us has to come out of our shell. For some, it may come faster but for people like Violet Walker, she had to take her time. In all honesty, I applaud Ms. Gordon for writing a character so emotionally flawed because it makes Violet relatable. I love how Ms. Gordon showed Violet's character growth with the help of Harper. I think everyone needs a friend like Harper to help push you in rediscovering your inner beauty and acceptance. I love that this book is about stripping you naked emotionally and helping you gain confidence. We all have a past. A scar. Experience some type of loss. And are vulnerable at one moment in our life. But when you truly evaluate your life, no one is perfect. Perfection does not define you but our imperfection is beauty.		Silence with Violet wasn't silence at all. She filled the space, slowed his thoughts, giving him a sense of peace.		So if you are looking for a book that interweaves heart, raw emotions, family, strength, beauty, confidence, second chances and love then Naked by Gina Gordon is the book for you.		~Michelle of Four Chicks Flipping Pages
0,Very sad account. People should know better.
0,K.R. Richards' has delivered another outstanding and exciting read!  New romances evolve and we meet new characters that were mentioned in previous books.  The attacks by the Brown Coats occur more often and challenge the Lords' survival strategies.  Not only must the Lords protect themselves, but also must keep their wives and families safe. A most fascinating new lady is Senny/Zenny.  Readers will be pleasantly surprised as they get to know her.  While reading, I am so immersed in this book that I feel like I am living that life instead of my own!  It is a book you don't want to put down!  The descriptions of Menadue and the surrounding areas are vivid and detailed.  I love that because I can picture it as I read which adds even more to the adventures of the Lords and in some cases, the Ladies, too!  The paranormal elements enrich the mystery and romance of the book. I very much look forward to the budding romance of Newt and Elowen in Lords of Atonement.  K.R. Richards has captured the historical fiction genre in superb form and I admire her work immensely!!  It is obvious that she has spent a great deal of time researching the history.  I highly recommend this book to everyone!  Kudos to you K.R. Richards!  You have surpassed my expectations with this novel.  I anxiously await another phenomenal story in Lords of Atonement!
0,Don't refer to it as often as I had hoped.  But the advice is sound nutrition and recipes are good.
0,This is my first time reading any book from this series as well as a first reading experience with this authors work. I didn't know what to expect it being my first and all. I have to say, I enjoyed it. It was a bit slow paced and the ending seemed a bit rushed after all of the hard work for the build. But I'd still read more of this authors work. I enjoyed the way she interpreted everything and kept the flow smooth and balanced. Also the fact that this is the third book in the series and I was able to read it as a stand alone says a lot.	I think any reader that enjoys this genre, will enjoy The Healer.
0,What a great series. I didn't want this story to ever end. I would love to see stories on Paul & Patrick.
0,Predator & Prey is a fast read.  There's no hanging about, no waffle or pretty much no setting the scenes but then you are there 'in' the scenes and it all just happens.  And I kinda like that.		Everything is pretty much insta, and anyone could (and probably will) argue why would she go off into the woods like that, but bah who cares, its fiction, it's definitely visual reading and it captures you.  The downside is, it's then over.  You have the need to jump into book 2 (in the hope you've got it)and that's great James has snared you into Lily's world.		Very good writing skills, the 'whole' story was delivered very succinctly and just like Lily's insta connection, the reader has that same connection too from the get go.		Really enjoyed this quick read and I'm looking forward to finding out whats in store for Lily and Wolf in book 2.		I received a copy of Predator & Prey in return for an honest review.  My reviews are my own and are 100% honest.
0,Really enjoyed this book. Jasper is a tough fighter who takes no crap. He was the perfect alpha male bad a$$ and very protective and possessive (just how I like them to be). Amber was perfect for him, she wasn't afraid to speak her mind.		Overall an excellent read. Sam Crescent never disappoints me. I love her books.
0,I really love this series I can't wAit until the next book. They had so many characters in this book and I really want a book for theme
0,A pleasant afternoon or quiet evening read.  There are enough turns to the plot to keep it flowing along.
0,Love the characters
0,Another great addition to this series!
0,I received a free copy of this book. What a rollercoaster of a story. I loved the romance between Summer and Evan. What happened to Summer and her husband is heartbreaking. This is well written and has a wonderful cast of characters. I would love to see stories about the other characters in the story. Keep tissues at hand when you read this.
0,I am not one to leave long reviews. As a reader, I either liked it or not. Few fall in the middle. This book is definitely a like!		Set in the future, Blood Master took me on a journey that surprised me, as well as, brought me great entertainment. I was able to relate to all the main characters and followed the story without a problem. The details given in this book was well thought out and researched. I was drawn into a world where the future has met devastation and, yet, there is a plan about to unfold to bring forth hope and to reunite people by eliminating evil that is out and about.		I am looking forward to Book 2.
0,What does every woman want? Someone willing to kill for them?  I think so! Kian is just that man. Hot to the core
0,Very well written book fell in love with the characters! Couldn't put it down! Found myself cheering for them! The storyline is believable and flowed well! I can't wait to read another of Juliette's stories!
0,Temperance Brennan seems to always fall into trouble when she least expects it.  If you want to know about swamps you will probably do what Temperance Brennan has vowed to do.  STAY OUT OF SWAMPS.
0,This latest book in the Unwind dystology lives of to the quality of its predecessors. This continues to be one of the creepier premises for a YA dystopian I have read. Here we get to see a little about how a well meaning scientific discovery was twisted into such a horrible policy that was all but embraced by society. Making it even creepier are the snippets of what I'm pretty sure are actual published articles that are worked into the story that appear to support the policy of unwinding or are otherwise relevant to various parts of the story. Looking forward to where the series is headed and am glad the story was not rushed so that this was the last book as originally planned.
0,This was not your usual romance, but that is why it is so good. Adam was disfigured in his teens, by challenging a man who was trying to tarnish an innocent young woman. Adam lost an eye, had a deep cut across his face , & a deep slash across his throat, hindering him from speaking above a whisper. He hid because people were repulsed when they saw him. He comes up with a plan to marry a woman named Eve who he has secretly fallen in love with. Eve is not to know who she is to marry, because her greedy parents sold her to Adam, who has a wedding planned where he & his attendants wear black & are masked, giving Eve the impression that her husband to be must be a demon. There, I won't tell you anymore. What follows are some funny moments which Eve's character naturally brings forth. Some frustrating moments brought out by Adam, along with a lot of romance throughout the story. This is so good! You will not be bored, that's for sure!
0,'The Stage' is the third and final book in Soper's Rock Trilogy.		This is definitely one of those books that you can't pick up without tearing through in one sitting.  The tension is high right from the start.  The concert is coming and there's a nail-biting sense of suspense; paths are crossing and mysteries are about to be unravelled so the big question is how will it all play out?  I don't want to spoil any surprises but the answer is with some shocking twists you won't be see coming!		There are some really great characters in this series, the favourite of mine being Mischka since I'm a big fan of kick-ass females, and the action never really stops from beginning to end which can being nerve wracking as it's hard to tell who's going to survive.  If you're into music you'll appreciate that side of things as Soper writes this element to the story so passionately and includes song lyrics that add to the atmosphere at different points in the books.		I would really like to see these books made into movies.  The story would translate well onto the big screen as the books are so visually descriptive.  I have to admit the truly powerful scenes have a great sense of foreboding to them and a lot of these scenes have really stuck in my head.		The bottom line is if you're into thrillers or action-packed books with a pinch of horror to them then you should read this series.  Highly recommended!
0,Thoroughly enjoyed this.  A different slant to a Space Opera fantasy/sci-fi. While not a shoot'em up, it does have some fast paced events.
0,Our Missy continues to perform above and beyond. This novel gives us, the readers, a greater appreciation of her bountiful abilities. A truly fun read, enjoy!
0,What could be more fun than a big shaggy stray and two strong-willed people who both think the dog belongs to them.. Even better, all the Dixie Virgins are back, and boy, do they have a lot to say! Love it! The delightful surprise in this book is the secondary character, Jedidiah Rakestraw, and his cyber fling on Match.com. I won't write a spoiler by telling you the name of his girlfriend. You have to read it for yourself and find out.  I can't wait for the third book!
0,I really enjoyed this book by Tamra Baumann. Quite funny at times. I got the audio version and Kate Rudd did a great job, as usual, on the performance. I could not put it down it was so good.
0,This entire series is great reading.
0,It seems my interest in Willow Rose novels runs hot and cold, and this novel runs hot-hot-hot.  As you get to the end of the book it has more twists than a curly fry from Arby's.  Admittedly, the beginning of the book seems to wander, but you gotta stick with it, as this "wandering" gives the background for the "twists" near the end that pulls together an amazing story.  It is the first of the 7th Street Crew series, and, if the other stories in this series are as good as this one, it should be one great read after another.  Don't pass up the opportunity to give this one a look.
0,This book is different than the other books in this series. She finds love but not with a man and she also discovers her true calling in life. The people of Hickory Stick will never forget Lilly and the miracle that took place.
0,I started reading the first book in the series, Into the Dark, and was a bit put off by the similarities to C. S. Foresters Hornblower series as well as Patrick O'Brian.  But as I continued on I became enmeshed in the characters and simply had to read the other 2 in the series. Thoroughly enjoyed all three and am looking forward to the next.
0,I LOVE HER WRITING AND HAVE BOUGHT THE REST OF THIS SERIES AND CAN'T WAIT TO EAD THEM.
0,Short stories. Some good and some just ok
0,VH has written a short story of a bounty hunter who is always looking for his next reward. He arrives in a small town to find more than a fair share in the area. This is a short that can be considered an excellent read for the genre..... ER
0,I wish I had this information when I first became an author. Its perfect to get you started and yet not too overwhelming. Its an excellent guide not just for the beginners but also for the experienced one that need reminders here and there.
0,What a heart warming story! I loved this book and Red's style of writing. I really enjoyed this book. Highly recommend!
0,Great first book in an interesting series.  Author must have been treated very badly in the South, because he really hates white southern men.  They are all murderers and rapists in this book.  A very sharp good/bad bias for the characters.  But, the women are beautiful and brave, and the heroes have plenty of warts.  No perfect people, but many interesting characters.
0,Never played it on the pc but I am loving it and it is a challenge on the Kindle. Not sorry that I bought it. It is just so cute the book worm with the big glasses. How can you resist from buying must have for all.
0,Loving this series. Can't wait to see what happens with all the Collingsworth girls. Good, clean entertainment. I love "sappy" romance stories where the characters rely on prayer and their faith in God to make decisions. Can't wait to read the next one.
0,The confidential memos continue in the second part of this story. Cassie finally gets to go to Mr. Reed's mansion for a night of fun and games. She ends up having her photo splashed on the front page of a gossip paper, leaving his house in her underwear. Looking forward to the next part of the story.
0,Great series, love them
0,The story starts unhappy. Dain is in such bad shape.  He's alone and so abused, it's hard to trust anyone, until he meets Jake. A Good read
0,The writing was good. I cared about the characters. But *boom*, I blinked and it was over. This would have been better as one big book instead of three little ones.
0,That's pretty much how you feel through the whole book. When you read this, you will take the journey to discover the truth with Star. That's the brilliance of the writing, it puts you in the story.		It's hard to write too much without spoiling the book which I do not want to do. I will say that if you follow the clues, you can almost figure out what is going on but not quite. To me that's the best part. The answer to the mysteries can't be so far fetched that we could never guess it but I also don't want to spend an entire suspense novel sure of the ending.		If you haven't read this book, you should really read it. I would recommend it even more if you're like me and were a reader of mystery\suspense and erotic romance. This book is the perfect combination of genres. This book is like an onion, it's got layers and lots of tears as they are pulled back.		P.S.- the erotic content is off the charts. You might want to read this with a partner (human or battery powered) nearby.
0,I was very impressed with this book by a new author. It has action, adventure, love, hate, terrorism, victory against scumbags, high-technology and philosophy all rolled up into one incredible book. It made me stop and think about our automatic responses to life events. I would and will recommend this book to all my friends! Thanks Peter, can't wait to read a sequel!
0,young love with a touch of danger..Wonderful story line. Obstacles to overcome with realistic situations. Looking forward to the second book.
0,Excellent! Love this book a lot! A must read! Best book to read! Love it!
0,I really liked this book!
0,Great read! Cat lovers unite! these fury little pets light up brilliantly and yet are so dangerous. Shanna unlike most cadets has two cats by her side. She has always been a bit strange but hey what can a girl do when the planet has only been inhabited by humans for 300 years? These cadets are not normal though, they all hold special abilities that are attached to their feline partners. Suddenly as a group decides to take a trip they findthemselves in true danger, their kind had left behind 300 years ago. Without the help of the starlynes they would not survive but grouping with them and learning their new skills may be a bit on the rearer side. what if your normal little family of cat breeders was suddenly thrust in a war they did not know existed and you were the mighty warrior for all? your little brother and ace marksman and determined to following in the footsteps so many failed to walk?What if we are invaded will we lose without the starlynes and what if everything we believe is wrong? what will they do? great read but you must read it for yourselves as I did and enjoy the majestic realm this author takes you into.
0,What can I say? Even though it was very predictable and when I started reading I knew what's going to happen. I really enjoyed it.		Chase deserved it!
0,Captured my attention page to page. Had moments of laugh out loud, to unbelievable. Thank You Ms. Gaines	Ameldra Aaron
0,I really love how it made you feel as part of the story. Keep up the great love story. Thank you!
0,I was skeptical at first after reading the description of the book. Then I started reading it and was swept away. This book was so real and so breathtaking.		The pain from the characters hit my heart. I can only imagine the difficulty in the decisions that were made. It was very real and depicted the struggle every mother goes through.		I loved this book and it was the realist most sincere words I've read all year. Just breathtaking.		Be prepared to cry, laugh, get angry and read a great novel.
0,I Do not usually read this kind of stories, but once I started reading the book, I was intrigued by the story line. Br sure yo read it, you will not be disappointed.
0,Great!
0,This is perhaps one of Devyn's best. A unique look at sexuality and love. There's sweetness and hilarity. This is one great tale you don't want to miss!
0,This book is a roller coaster ride of emotions.  Definitely worth the read.  It is Mel and Painter's story (nice if you've read the other books, but not necessary).  Do yourself a favor and walk on the wild side.
0,Slow Cooker Recipes/Crockpot Recipes: Top 25 World Class Recipes by Steven J. Smith uses a wide variety of meat, poultry,and fish in the recipes. I noticed a few recipes listed ingredients I don't normally have in my pantry. However there are plenty of recipes that I can make without running to the store. The author mentions dumping ingredients in the crock and off you go.... this is a little misleading. There are a number of recipes that require sauteing or other prep work. On the positive, a wonderful variety of ethnic recipes. I am interested in trying the Indian, Mexican and Italian recipes for starters.

0,"Older people live, laugh, and love."  In this third book in the bridge series, Mis Mike, although not that old, does all three.  The highlight of this novel is when she falls in love with Chief Alan Bitterroot, a Native American who manages an Indian Camp.  She is led to the camp because she finds a murdered woman in a dumpster and shortly thereafter encounters a suspicious man accompanied by a young, very frightened girl.  The man reacts violently when she attempts to take a photo of them, and this sets her off to save the child and solve the crime.  Both the romance and the crime is filled with conflict.  Stephanie McKean is very skilled in engaging the reader in the fast action of her stories.
0,The Grey Man was the perpetrator of horrible crimes against children.  But he saw them as angels in need of purifation, he was commanded by voices and in the service of his insanity.  He had been in Bellevue curing the times of his killing, but was ignored I. His quiet persona.  He was never evaluated or treated to any degree and was found sane and released.  When finally apprehended, he was tried and his insanity defense rejected.  At his execution, he had no real sense of his situation.	We are given information on his crimes, but also his life.  The jury in fact knew he was insane but feared to release him to forensic institution.  This book examines the question, how we as a society should deal with the insane who harm us?  Is treatment mandated, and if so where.  This is a small novella with large questions.
0,Great story, the set up from the first book leaves you wanting to know more about these three widows and the adventures that they dare to take.
0,A short,sweet and romance story. Not really action packed or adventurous but it is heart warming. I recommend this book.
0,Started out moving slow, but got better.  I loved Wesley's character.  He was such a good guy always doing the right thing for Reagan.  It could have gone so many ways, but glad they figured it out for their HEA.
0,loved it
0,Even though I felt I had read this book before I realized that I had either read one very much like this only some things were a little different. I loved the characters and the story line was very interesting. I laughed and cried with in a few pages of each other. I'm glad it turned out the way it did but was sorry about the brother. It only goes to show that magic might really exist!!
0,Meredith had been sent home from St  Ailbes as it had  closed indefinitely. Lucianna was an evil witch who had cursed Meredith so she couldn't connect with her inner wolf. And Meredith had slowly lost power and sh had almost died. The curse had been broken and Luciana was dead. Meredith had a great mate Donovan. He was the Alpha of the Irish pack. Meredith understood why Mr. Dawson had closed St Ailbes. Since werewolves made global news by fighting Luciana and her demons in the chapel in Santa Fe. Donovan was dealing with the fallout of their exposure. The Council of seven werewolves were in Canada, meeting with a delegation of witches. Fey and other supernaturals. A few months ago Meredith was still cursed and no were in his right mind would go out on a date with Meredith let alone be her mate. But then Tessa broke the curse . Meredith owed Tessa her life. Donovan was one of the most powerful werewolfs in the  history of the werewolf race. Donovan's pack was notoriously unfriendly. Merediths father had kept her confines to the property because of how much Meredith had been on the news lately. . Cosette was fey but finally texted Meredith back and they met at the mall. Cosette gave her a green velvety pouch Now the bracelet in the pouch would protect Meredith. Cosette said to put the bracelet on and not to take it off for any reason. Cosette said Donovan's pack was a mess and would get worse. Also Cosette warned Meredith not to go to Ireland right now if she could help it. Cosette said she was getting hauled into hiding. Cosette also told Meredith to look for the truth. Donovan was one of the seven werewolfs  of the Council of Alphas that ruled all the packs. Then Donovans second was murdered and Donovan had to go back to Ireland and Meredith decided she was going with him so she could be at his side. Even though Meredith knew she would be in danger she went with Donovan as he was her true mate.	I loved this story. It had so many things in it like: an Alphas council. a monster. Fey, a mad wolf. A messed up pack. Werewolves, suspense. Intrigue, action, honor, love, humor, strength, a true mate, and so much more. I loved how even though it was dangerous Meredith went to Ireland to be at Donovans side. Also Meredith wouldnt back down from Donovans pack  no matter what. She was to be the Alpha female and no one else. Meredith showed strength, courage, bravery, loyalty, love, honor, and determination to name a few things about Meredith. I also loved how Meredith chanced her own life to not only save Donovan mother but the mother and her children as well as other things she had done during this story. This story had a great plot and kept my attention from  beginning to end. There was even a twist or two during the story. I thoroughly enjoyed this story. I really cant think of anything wrong with this story as far as I am concerned. I loved the characters and twists and turns of this story and I highly recommend.
0,If you like sweet and steamy with a little touch of humor , this is the book for you.  HEA
0,The final part to this series featuring Chase and Isa did not disappoint. It was worth the wait.  The ending was great.  In this installmeent Isa got to shine,  You have to read this part to find out how.
0,I was going through so many emotions. A good read.
0,This is one of those series of books where you find yourself smiling while reading-a lot!  Celia Kyle has the ability to make her unique world seem real and her characters?  Some you want real just so you can bring them home and keep them!  Yes, I am a Celia Kyle fan.  And proud of it.
0,Very good book.
0,Rayne ran from her pain and ended up renting a house many miles from home.  It happens to be Christian's house, and his aunt rented it out for him without his knowledge.  Obviously, Christian coming home, out of the blue, to Rayne in his shower was awkward.		They both hide their pain.  Their attraction to each other is strong.  Can their attraction overcome their pain?  Can either of them have a healthy romantic relationship?		My emotions ran strong through this book.  At times, I was so happy that they were finding love.  At other times, I was so frustrated with both of them.  The sex is hot!  Wow!  I loved this book.  I loved the characters.  I hope there is a sequel.
0,Jerry, amuses me, a diverse writer, with great story lines.  I've read everything Jerrys done.		Pussycat
0,This story had a different type of twist to it. A love story that moves along smoothly until the plot twists just enough to make it interesting.  Good light reading.
0,If you have followed the series you will know how hard Cordy's life has been and you really do need to read the other three books of the series first.	  This is a great final book of the series, it does not just leave you hanging, it wraps up with the end of  Cordy's story very nicely, left me feeling good.	  I recommend this book to all who wants to know what has become of Cordy.
0,Great book for children
0,This was a great book with a very unique twist. Eden is on her way to a penal colony planet on the far side of the galaxy. Ghost and a Mixer are her jailers. Once she boards their transport ship, their lives are never the same. One has to wonder just WHO is really in charge on board. Lots of disciplinary spankings, some erotic ones and lots of HOT sex make this book fly. (Ok, pun intended) I really liked the idea of the Holodec/simulator were anything is possible, rock climbing, trips to the beach or midevel dungeons where female prisoners are trained and spanked. Wonderful exciting ending with a Huge HEA.
0,Siempre es un placer leer cualquier libro que escriba Mariel , y Todo por esa boca , no es la excepcin . Genial y digno broche de oro para una historia tan bonita como la de Alex y Vernica !
0,I love this author's love stories. I appreciate the jagged edges that bring bite and truth to life. I'm always happy after finishing the final page and anticipating what she will think of next.		Katherine has a broken side that she keeps buried deep down. Her attempts to not let the past rule her present have been successful until the handsome stranger shows his face offering the opportunity of a lifetime. Why can't Katherine be nice to him when he has the perfect caf plans laid out?		Holst is a breath of deliciously fresh air. He is patient, kind, and extremely attractive. Even after months of Katherine doing her best to push him away with her sassy attitude, Holst remains strong and solid. I admired him a lot and he kept the story flowing smoothly, even with the unexpected bumps and dives.		Katherine might have a decent resolve but it is no match. Holst eventually manages to convince her that taking a chance could be an extremely beneficial decision. Let me tell you how happy I am she finally gave in! Wowza!!! Not only does this author write amazing romance but the heat and passion are always off the charts as well. Yum!		Fall in lust and love with this novel today! Holst will warm your heart and melt your panties!!!
0,Book 5 in the Forehead Kisses series was a really quick and good read. This book was the conclusion to the Scotty and Livia storyline. In Book 4 we learned that Livia was hiding a traumatic event in her past and that Scotty had fallen for her after years of just hooking up with random girls and essentially being a man whore. In Unforgettable we find them learning to trust one another and being truthful about their lives.		What was great in this book is that Livia who was really closed off from people finally tells the truth about what happened to her in her life that changed her. She opens up to Scotty, her boyfriend, and Ash, her brother. It felt like it helped them understand her and her closed off nature a lot better.		This book was intense in the sense it covers heavy topics. Especially that of abusing a person in the worst way. I don't want to say to not be spoilery, but this book had a powerful message, of how important it is to not let traumatic events define you and to rise above them to appreciate the little things in life that make it great.		Scotty and Livia did get really hot and heavy in this book. It gets steamy. But overall, what I love about this couple is how sweet and considerate they are of each others feelings.		I'm looking forward to reading Ash's story in book 6 and 7 in this series. He is a really good brother to Livia but he does act recklessly in his personal life. With that being said, I look forward to seeing him mature and trying to be a better man. He seems to think very badly of all people even though he parties and drinks a lot and sleeps around. I wonder what is lying underneath. And for those fans of the Vampire Academy and Bloodline series by Richelle Mead, Ash reminds me of a non supernatural Adrian Ivashkov.		Rating: 4/5
0,I laughed all the way to the end of this one. Even though it was funny the book had some serious business about it so if you want good street lit with some laughs this is the one.
0,This short story of the beginning of Zoe and Ayden was an great introduction of the love story to come.  Amber you did a great job and I cant wait for the rest of their story to be told.
0,When the bride, Emma Miller, decides that she and her bridesmaids need that one last girls trip before the wedding, they go to Bolivia to Salar de Uyuni, and they start on an exciting adventure.  Staying at Palacio de Sal and touring what is known as the world's largest mirror and going to Isla de los Pescadores, known as the Island of the Fish.  Emma climbs some rocks to get a better picture and disappears and meets a wizard Amaru who says many strange things to her. Giving her an antique mirror, she is transported back to sixteenth century England and there she meets Lord Ashton Colyns. He finds her shocking but refreshing. These two strangers, from different time periods, are drawn towards each other. Can Emma visualize her past, stand still and let the time roll forward from behind her? Don't think about tomorrow, look forward to yesterday.  Disclosure:  I received an e-copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.  All thoughts, opinions, and ratings are my own.
0,I received a copy in exchange for an honest review.		Extremely enjoyable read. I loved both Ariane and Liam from the very beginning. Fantastic story and great characters. This book is a great mix of romance, a little steaminess, a little drama. Very real look at the ups and downs of celebrity. Highly recommend.
0,A little quirky but very enjoyable. I wish I had read the books before this one but I am in no way disappointed.
0,The Vagabond King by James Campion Conway, is a captivating story, beautifully told, filled with metaphors enough to taunt any imagination, and sadly enchanting. Chris, a teenage boy on the cusp of adulthood, loses his mother to cancer. Life suddenly fades from bright shades of hope and sky-high dreams, to gray clouds and moroseness as he finds himself losing perspective and asking questions about his existence, God and the nature of who he is. Confused - he becomes more and more distanced from his father, school and the regimens of his daily lifestyle. Chris eventually finds solace in a stranger, a woman named Magda, a woman who would go on to change his life in ways he could never imagine. The Vagabond King is gritty, it's real-life, it's got tangible pain and one often feels the emotional solitude that haunts and permeates Chris' life, leaving him floating in a sea of confusion, like a ship drifting at sea. So many ponderable questions are posed, some are answered, others are left proding at one like small pins in one's mind. The question that draws the reader through this story is, will Chris find the answers and the closure he so desperately seeks. An excellent read.
0,Couldn't ask for a better ending to a remarkable series. I loved learning Rick' s true character and the heart touching story of Rick finding true love at last.
0,This is an issue we are simply underestimating. I mean this is a genuine condition however we don't have enough learning about the cures we have for it. Fortunately, This book is composed in a straight forward manner, making it easy to understand. The cures given are regular so we don't need to stress over compound aggravates that may bother our skin more. It likewise has presentation on by what means will needle therapy for bothersome skin as well as Bentonite clay. This book has tips that are viable, Highly prescribed!
0,Great little novella to entice for further reading. I have yet to read the rest of the series but I'm definitely interested after reading this one.
0,This was a sweet ending to the play scene between Tab and Ryan. I liked that she got her miracle and they will be a family. A sweet sweet treat.
0,This is a prequel to the author's 3 books in his "Man of War" series.  I read this book first.  It adds to the first two books, does not distract.  Will read the 3rd book next.  This is a very good story.  One of the better ones I have read lately.  The author says there will be more prequel novellas for this storyline.  I look forward to them and highly recommend this series to any reader.
0,The first book in The Boss Series is off with a bang. This story will pull you in and keep you coming back for more.
0,This novel was a really good read, featuring well-drawn characters, described to perfection. Crazy Katherine is down on her luck and lives her life according to her horoscope. What she doesn't count on is meeting astrologer James and him making her see stars! At first she sees them for all the wrong reasons but as this story develops so do their feelings for one another.		A delightful story set in a quaint English village with characters you will think you've met before! I loved old Jake and Tom the postman!		A must read!
0,Radar Love is very fast paced, in the most delightful way! The only time I was able to put this book down was for bed about 40% through the book because it was 3am in the morning! Niether predictable or boring for a single minute, Radar Love will be a book you won't be able to put down- especially if you love rather unconventional love stories.		There's nothing I enjoy more than reading a book that is completely unlike something I've read before. Unfortunately, this often leaves me unsatisfied and wanting more of really awesome novels that have no sequel. Luckily, this isn't the case with Radar Love and I cannot wait for other installments  in Jason Z Christie's Ultimate Hustle series! Chris and Janique are two lovers separated not only by a penitentiary, but also by Janique's parents, if they had any say in the matter. Janique isn't your average "poor little rich girl" though. Trapped in a sheltered life growing up, she more than makes up for the shelteredness when she meets and falls madly in love with Chris, a rougher type of guy who introduces her to a world of thrills from pain, to pleasure, and everything in between.  I do advise that if you don't like harsh language, explicit (and yet beautifully written) sex scenes of unconventional sexuality, this book would probably not be your cup of tea- but I really did enjoy it.		This book was provided for me by the author at no charge, nor was I given compensation	of any kind for this review. This review only reflects my personal opinion.
0,Had any of these? An abusive alcoholist as a father + being bullied at school + a caretaker who doesn't take care of you + serious overweight + genetic tendency to (fatal) depression... The author Paul Brodie teaches me, in a clear and crisp way, how he pursues happiness no matter what. (He IS a teacher, after all.) His view on things is both very personal and very practical. As a reader I could easily relate to his life stories and suggestions how to deal with them. Very personal also means: not theoretical. Very practical also means: no deep analysis. Brodie just tells what has worked for him.
0,If your goal is to learn everything you can about copyright laws, this pretty much either covers it or it refers you to where to get the information. It is full of information and I would recommend it to anyone wanting comprehensive information about copyrights.
0,A little weird but interesting can't say it was a favorite. l have definitely read better of Joe Hart. not a must read sorry
0,Personally, I loved this book. Been waiting for it for awhile now but it was worth the wait. Mardi is one of those authors who is an automatic buy for me. Great story!!!
0,I enjoyed reading this story and liked the characters. The story line was easy to follow and I thought well written. I recommend it.
0,Really engaging, well-developed characters.  I enjoyed the dual POVs to help understand what the H and h are thinking.  It was angsty and well-paced, two people who need a self-esteem boost.  It's the beginning of a series so it ends with a cliffhanger.  But it was so interesting, it didn't make me mad, it just made me want to read the next one.  Highly recommend!
0,I volunteered to review an Advance Reader Copy of this book.		Scarred by C.M. Steele is a short hot insta love book. The two main characters are scarred and share a history that neither remember and only know of it from what they were told as children and some short memory flashes. In this sexy book you get an alpha male, greedy crazy secondary characters and a love that involves not only chemistry but deep understanding between the two main characters about their pain and insecurities.		This book is receiving a 4 star review from me because it was that good.
0,This story was an unexpected surprise in a good way. I don't usually read m/m erotica, but the title had me curious.  I loved this story and enjoyed the realistic way the author described the characters experiences. I found myself smiling most of the time because it was funny in places. I will definitely look forward to reading more by this author
0,What an emotional roller coaster!  I LOVE dark books, and this one is intense!  GREAT JOB!
0,This series is a lot of fun and each book is better than the last.
0,The Queen of the Tearling by Erika Johansen is a unique fantasy novel that follow Kelsea Raleigh as she takes the throne. Kelsea had been sent into hiding as an infant to protect her life and has lived in near isolation for nearly twenty years. Now it is time for her to reclaim the throne. Unfortunately for Kelsea, there is a price on her head and danger from all angles. Not to mention that she is only 19 years old and very sheltered. She must do her best to reach the throne and right the wrongs of her kingdom. I loved The Queen of the Tearling. It was an epic book that held my interest the entire way through. I love Kelsea as a character and the world-building was fantastic. All of the minor characters held my interest and the plot, though not fast moving, touched me greatly.		Firstly, lets talk about Kelsea Raleigh. She is a very plain looking and naive girl who was raised in cottage, far from society, by an elderly couple. The truths about her kingdom and her family were kept from her and she has only the barest understanding of the politics of her time. She is  meant to be queen and she has the moral compass to do it, but shes not prepared when she first sets out to take the throne. I love Kelsea because she is different than most heroines that I read about. Yes, shes special and she is the hope for her world, etc, etc., but she is not a bad-ass chick who can dual wield swords and make any man fall in love with her in one glance. She is a plain, plump girl who has a strong will but lacks self confidence. She forces herself to overcome her shortcomings, of which there are a believable amount, and do what is right for her people, even if it is incredibly uncomfortable or dangerous for her. She has flaws and weaknesses. She has trouble fitting into her armor and she doesnt learn to fight with a sword well at all. She is not physically formidable and she does not have a natural presence that garners respect. Yet she commands the room and takes to the throne with a natural ability. She is one of the most realistic monarch characters I have read outside of historical fiction and history books.		The world of Tearling, and surrounding countries, is fascinating. The book presumably takes place sometime in our future after a great disaster has struck society. Europe is no longer a viable home and humanity has moved over to North America in the Great Crossing. Most technology has been lost, including medicine and the printing press. Books are nearly impossible to find and society is just beginning to redevelop past technologies. Gun powder, for instance, has not be rediscovered or reinvented in Tearling. There are references to our time throughout the book, with the mention of electronic books, the seven tombs of Rowling and The Hobbit, which I found entertaining and set the scene very well. I am very interested in learning more about what happened before the Great Crossing and what technologies there might be left to discover or recreate.		The big bad in this series is the Red Queen, ruler of Mortmesne, a country on the border of the Tearling. The Red Queen is a tyrant who rules through force and fear. She takes hundreds of human slaves as tribute each month and does who knows what with them. There is an undercurrent of despair running throughout the entire world. The poor, in the Tearling and elsewhere, are barely getting by and are forced to live in a feudal system. The high class folks ignore the poor and dress in finery, shopping the Mortmesne black market for whatever they desire, ignoring the slave trade completely. It is a rather depressing world.		There is also magic in this world. It is not overpowering. There are no wizards or witches running around. Instead, the Tearling is more like a medieval world with some magic thrown in, more like the Game of Thrones world. Kelsea has inherited the necklaces that all the Tearling rulers wear and these necklaces are imbued with some magical power. The antagonist, the Red Queen, also has magic abilities and she uses them to keep her people under a firm yolk. I enjoy that the magic is downplayed and only comes out for extraordinary circumstances. I also enjoy the Kelsea doesnt understand the powers and is learning about them just as we, the reader, are.		The plot itself is very engaging. I found that the book started off slowly and meandered a bit at the beginning. In general, the book moves at a relatively slow pace for the most part, taking its time introducing the characters, the history of the land, and the development of Kelsea as a ruling monarch. If you want something very fast-paced and action-packed, you might be disappointed. That said, there are seriously tense moments in this book, with chases, fights, etc. There is definitely action to be had.		The Queen of the Tearling is a rather dark book. Though it features a young adult, it is not a teen book. There is graphic language, graphic violence, and hard subjects throughout the book. There are terrible, violent acts and truly saddening topics, such as slavery and abuse. The Tearling is a realistic society, in that there is strife, starvation and unhappiness. Kelsea wishes to improve the lot of her subjects but this book is realistic and serious. It is clearly not going to come up roses and have a full on happy ending. Characters will die, will be betrayed and will worm their way into your heart along the way.		I recommend this book to anyone who likes epic stories and fantasy worlds, even alternate histories. Kelsea is a fantastic female protagonist, so if you're looking for a book with a strong, realistic female lead, this fits the bill. Just keep in mind that this book is gritty and dark, realistic in its saddest and most poignant parts.		Visit my blog for more reviews! http://www.cayt.com
0,First off - I want to say, I follow Jamallah on FB, and she is one of the most genuine, nicest, authors I have met. She's never to busy to say hi, or give positive reinforcement of others hopes dreams!		HCF hits all of the right spots - Chocolate, sex, and the opera, pa-lease! May I have another helping!		Everything about the story is good, from a great plot, to string characters, you can relate to, and hopefully (Like Me) fantasies about being.		And the cover rock!		Great job, Ms. Bergman!		Gretchen Lane : )
0,I'll say it.  I love books by this author.  I always fall in love - i.e. big love - with the hero and with the heroine as well.  Always erotic so - some times one-handed reads
0,This is one very hot overwhelming book.  It is a great story as the two main characters come to grips with their intense attraction and what that will mean for them.  This is a tantalizing read.
0,I love  southern stories.  My family is from GA and we vacationed near Charleston for any years.  Many of the places mentioned in the story were very familiar to me.  This book had it all. Mystery, sex , murder and lots of humor.
0,ARC Review. I received this book in exchange for an honest review. The premise of this book is about Abigail, a writer and waitresses, and Gavin, a grief stricken musician.  They meet and have this pull but both have issues that prevent them from moving from their current lives. Gavin lost his band mates in a terrible accident a few years ago and doesn't have the spark to write a song again. He meets Abigail who slowly shows him that there is more in life and becomes his muse. I enjoyed this book and how the story played out, however I think the author spends a little too much time on inner thoughts. At times I felt like she kept trying to explain something only she over explained. This is the only issue I found and thought it was well written.  I like how Aubrey ends her books and I am  looking forward to the next book.
0,This was a great short update on one of my favorite series. Reading it made me remember how much I missed all the characters. The funny antics Casey did to Nate were typical Casey funny as hell! So glad they expanded their family. Please keep the updates coming...
0,I loved it!  I've read a ton of paranormal/ shifter books, and Shara put a new spin on claiming.  I really liked that.  The Ronin that was described was beyond hot and the 'scenes' were steamy.  I sincerely hope the other stories come to be.  Even if it's no longer Christmas, buy this book!  You'll thank me later.
0,They were so good I ordered 4 through 8 as soon as I finished book 3.  Enjoyed immensely.  Marie Force has become one of my favorite writers.
0,*A complimentary copy was given in exchange for an honest review*	I loved this book! After I started it I couldn't put it down until I knew what happen with Daniel and Rose. So this is the story of Daniel and Rose who are mates that had a few things to work through before coming close to a happy ever after. This story has it all, mystery,romance, a were lion, a sassy BBW woman, a tough momma and lots of love. I promise you will not regret getting this book. Once again she has written a book that I could get lost in the characters and explore this wonderful world she has created! Can't wait for the next!!!
0,Guys can be so dumb.  Out of all the girls, you would sleep with her so-called friend that was desperate to sleep with you.  Damn, you can't show so type of constraint???  Just disgusting. I really hope he doesn't die so he can make it up to her. Myla deserves a beat down. I'm so upset that he did that to DJ knowing she may be pregnant.  I'm still like wow that he slept with that trifling girl that wanted to betray her friend. Excited for part 2
0,Just when I thought I had read all the vampire books, I find this one.  It is a different approach to the world of the vamps, but interesting and new.  Plenty of conflict and resolutions.		The characters are conflicted, but do resolve some conflicts although, not in ways the reader would expect.		This is the first book in what will be a great series.		The Born to Darkness series is one for your e-readers.
0,Super fun series. So glad that it continues!		I cant wait to find out what happens next - will there be a proposal?
0,This book was great. I really enjoyed reading it
0,Great for my classroom.
0,Loved it!
0,Hot single dad who loves his kids to distraction and is a kick ass hockey player? Sign me up right away! Thats how I felt about Ryker, the latest installment of Sawyer Bennets Cold Fury series. Ryker is new goalie the team and hes just trying to keep it together for his daughters, never expecting to fall for his general manager.		The fireworks fly between him and Gray, whos made her name in a mans industry. To watch these two dance around each other was interesting, but there were a couple of things about this story that kept it from being a five star read for me. It was a bit annoying to watch Gray complete obsession with her job at the expense of everything else. Ryker is a sweetheart, but hes almost too much of a softie, allowing all the women in his life to walk all over him. And there was a lack of interaction between Gray and Rykers girl. I am all about not introducing a child to a new relationship but the lack of interaction made it a bit unbelievable to picture them as a family. Despite these I did enjoy this story, and I cant wait for the next book.
0,THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA is a simple story about an old man, with ideas, and an encounter with the sea. He catches a massive marlin.	This is a story of success while failing and refusing to give up. Most importantly, its a story about courage.		I started reading the book, and couldn't quit. I wanted to know the old mans thoughts, his ideas. The tension increased as the huge fish dragged him further and further out to sea.		I enjoy the writing style of Hemingway. I find myself wanting to write like this, short, declarative sentences. I also find myself trying to study his style, to learn how he wrote so simple, yet so profound. For Ernest took me, the reader, deep into the mindset of the old man, giving me an emotional experience.
0,This is not your typical boy meets girl on campus type of romance.  It has a few twists and turns which I found very enjoyable and kept me entertained.  Even though this is book 2 of Love at Center Court, you don't have to read Verite' (book 1) but it's also very good and you should.
0,David Dalglish has done it again.  The interweaving of the characters and plot is a masterpiece of writing.  Dalglish has the imagination of a man involved with putting his fantastic mind altering views of fantasy down in story.  Write onwards David!
0,I fell in love with the characters as soon as they met on the boat that Connor takes. Jay is intriguing. Danger lurks beneath his calm exterior. Glimpses of his passionate and kind nature emerge as the story develops.	The love story side of this suspense is gorgeous. Loved the whole thing.
0,There is a love/hate relationship between Emilia and Alex and it's seriously sexy:	  She whispered, Ive no desire to have a public relationship with you.	  You wish to keep it a private affair?	  He was playing with her and she needed to gain the upper hand.	  I don't see how this could benefit you.	  He met her gaze. Thirty seconds alone and I could demonstrate how I plan to benefit.	I really liked this book, Alex was sexy and Emilia was a strong female.
0,Wow ! What a ride of emotions, adventures with so many twists and turns; that you will not be able to put it down? I have a great love for shifter books of all kind but my favorite is dragons. Very pleased with the series, anxious to read, Rohan's  story and highly recommended?
0,Zoey, Tristan and Simon have been major problems for the agency. Although they have saved the day on more than one occasion, one of the directors always seems to have an issue with them, especially Zoey.		Her mother has been sold to strange doctors in the nexus, the type who cut you up for one reason or another. The portal is open and now both worlds will be destroyed. Who will save the day? Who else.  The three friends cross into the nexus and are captured.		What happens next will excite and terrify you. I couldn't put the book down until I had read every page. This is an excellent ending to a fascinating series.
0,Josslyn Turner, the Admin Asst of Detectives at the Buckhorn Police Department. Eric, her ex-boyfriend, wants her back. She's not interested. One evening, Josslyn was working late, and Vincent West walks in with the Captain and 2 other cops. Vincent was in a vehicular accident. The Capt introduces Vincent to Josslyn. While waiting for his lawyer, there is a blackout in the department. In the dark, Josslyn and Vincent have a nice talk. Attraction builds. The lights come back on, Vincent's lawyer arrives, and he gives his statement. Afterwards, Vincent asks Josslyn out to dinner tomorrow night. She accepts. The next day, Eric drops by Josslyn's job to talk and humiliates her. That evening, Josslyn goes to dinner with Vincent. Then they have sex in Josslyn's apartment. The next morning, a drunk Eric shows up on Josslyn's doorstep, barging into her home. Vincent comes out the bedroom. Josslyn is worried about what will happen next. I just love a good cliffhanger!! Good read
0,The four stars are for the content. There was well-documented information here, though I have read other books about Bill O'Reilly and his inability to live in the real world. My main concern was the poor use of punctuation, causing me to stop reading to figure out what the writer was trying to say. Proper punctuation allows a reader to move comfortably through the material being read.
0,I truly enjoyed this book. When I checked it out at my local library I didn't realize it was part of a series. The author did a good job of keeping the reader caught up on the back stories of the characters. I typically do not read series books but I was so impressed with the writing style I will definitely continue to seek out books by this author.
0,About a year ago I found a new author I HAVE GOTTEN HOOK NOW ON THE DIFFERENT SERIES BY THIS AUTHOR after the first book I now have most of all the series so far my favorites are the  blood  Destiny series
0,not what I thought it would be
0,***Was gifted a copy for an honest review***		 When I first started this book it was really slow and my first thought was oh no, not another book I am not going to like.  I also didn't understand a lot of what was being said in the beginning so I was very confused a lot.  As I continued reading the book it started to get a lot better. By the end of the book I was in love with it and was looking forward to reading the next book in the series.	This book was very beautifully written. After the beginning it flowed well and I loved the characters.  It made me feel like I was a part of the story.	Would recommend to everyone.
0,I received this book as an arc for my honest review. I loved this story. Once I started I couldn't put it down. You will not be disappointed.
0,Great second chance at love story. Interesting characters with a few twists. I also love how family and friends become one.
0,What a beautiful short story, definitely worth your time to read. This story had tears in my eyes while reading and I will take this with me for a while. A beautiful blending of two stories, one told by a teen and the other by an older woman, both with major issues and both searching for love and hope.
0,Book five in The Kings series definitely did not disappoint.  Heather Killough-Walden's books are so descriptive that you lose yourself in their magic.  It's a journey you take with the characters that makes you cheer them on in their battles and triumph while also making you morn the losses right along side them.  I couldn't put it down from start to finish and as always with her writing, I was a little sad to see the book.  I look forward to the next installment of this wonderful series!
0,Yum!

0,With my discount I can offer a rating of 4 Stars. It keeps you reading and reading. Truly entertaining.
0,I enjoyed Patricia PacJac Carroll story of misfits and finding love when they are over 40 and have had difficult struggles in their lives.  Nettie is 40 and has lived her entire life as the only daughter whose job was to take care of her parents and after their deaths, to be a live in spinster aunt  with each of her brothers.

0,Enjoyable story.  My heart hurt for Sasha with each word and gesture of disrespect.  An indication of how cruel people can be.  She certainly deserves a happily ever after.

0,**4.5 Stars**		With the first two books, about Maddie and Ryder, we met Cash. He was a lone survivor, from Maddies past, and someone that got colder with each thing he was forced to do in this new world. A world where outside forces put on an EMP bomb, causing the U.S. to go into utter chaosno electricity, no technology, no media. A country with no idea who to fight against, how to fight, and how to survive on little. I was enraptured with the first two books, and having met Cash in them, I was rabid for more of him.		I was going to hell, my grandmother said. I was rotten to the core, my stepmother claimed. I was perfect, my dad insisted. I was all of the above and more.		Cat is not a pink-wearing, smiling, happy-go-lucky girlNo, shes seen some s***. Shes suffered, shes been abandoned by those she loved, shes cold. As the blurb states, she is not someone you like. Shes cold, careless, usedbut we all know that people suffer grievances differently, and Cat was no different. As with anyone who suffers trauma of any kind, you learn to build that wall that protects you. And she was the brickmaster building that damn wall. She wanted no part of anyone. And while you may have issues understanding her or, heck, even liking her, youll learn to know who she is. And the only person who has the key to that wall is Cash.		She looked like an angel but I wanted to love her like the devil even if it meant damning my own soul.		Cash is the southern, hard-working, cowboy. Hes respectful, mature, a gentleman. He knows what it means to be raised on a farm, and its a part of him. He likes calm, the expected, and simpleeverything the complete opposite of Cat. And even if shes too high-brow, too high maintenance, and way too prissy, something magnetizes him to her. He doesnt get it, he wishes, at times, that it would leave him alone, but she calls to him. The sweet, southern gentleman will have to change to survive, to protect those he loves.		Youre worth it, Cat. Remember that. Were all worthy of love.'		As with the prior novels, once we entered war time, the pages just flew by. Ms. Weaver is a genius when it comes to writing this war-torn, scary new world that she created. The way the people change, the danger, the loveall of it. And we don't start in the war, no, we begin when Cash and Cat first meet. We go through their tumultuous relationship, and then the struggles of the war. We see how the war affects each character, how it tears apart trust, and basic human instinct. Oh, and the loss. So much loss. We, as readers, are thrust into the world and you begin to feel torture over their strife. You can feel their pain, feel their fear, suffer their sense of loss of hope. I felt that the beginning was a little slow for me, but once we entered war-time, I was all in. Nothing stopped me from finishing once things kicked off. It does end at a point where its a cliffhanger, and their story won't conclude in this book. Overall, I truly enjoyed Cashs story, and cant wait for more!		What does that make you? My prince or my slave?	It makes me your king, sweetheart.'		**Received an ARC in exchange for an honest review**
0,Great Lee Child
0,Murder in the Dark (Book One Santangelo PG-Rated Mystery/Thriller Series)	by Steve Demaree		Twelve people a doctor, a judge, a private detective, a kindergarten teacher, a firefighter, a mystery author, a librarian, a taxidermist, a real estate agent, an insurance agent, a funeral director, and a computer programmer, are invited to spend a weekend in a secluded Inn. They all have a invitation, but don't know who it is from. What they soon find out is there is a murderer there. As people are being killed they all wonder who can be trusted and who will be the next to die. They have to find out who is doing the killing before no one is left.		A fast paced who-done-it. Secrets, twists and turns make it an intense story. Some of the characters are likable, while others are not so desirable. A great murder/mystery. I recommend to those who love a good who-done-it.
0,I just finished reading the fifth and final High Heals mystery and I sure wish I had a sixth.  I loved them, I couldn't put them down and to say one was better than the other would be tough as I really felt like I was reading one big big book.  I am going to order the next book by this author as soon as I finish this review.
0,Usually i avoid dragon books. Reason being the dragons are almost always too overpowered to make things interesting. While this dragon was powerful he was by no means overly so. There was some great action, some quality banter, and some cool progression and growth (not character growth more status and power). I particularly enjoyed the main characters poor understanding of humans.	There is no romance but plenty of plot twists and action. This book is fine for anyone to read without offense.		I only noticed two errors in the editing so I think other reviewers may be getting a little precious.		Eager to read book two.
0,I found these stories a nice change of pace from the other erotica I've been reading. Much nicer and much needed change of pace.
0,Lara is a young girl who like all of us wants a better life, some moment changed. Her father gives her time travel as a gift to go back and see her mom before she was murdered. Lara realizes on one of her views of the past, that when she time travels, she can touch people, things... She can interact. She's not suppose to be able to do that. And making any changes has a huge ripple effect. The mess it makes, it huge. From gaining siblings, a new boyfriend and her dad being in prison.  All because she stopped her mom from being shot... Crazy good book. Warning, cliffhanger ending, :) loved it, can't wait for the next one.	I was given this book for my honest review... And here it is... :)
0,Always a great read.
0,This book has so much useful information. It tells you about herbs and wild flowers that can be used to treat just about and ailment. A good read for people new to herbs and people who are experienced and want a guide on hand
0,Thank you for the gift first of all!  I was thinking to myself since I have to have a certain amount of calories per day how much does these snacks have. i am like I am going to have to find out for the ones that drew my attention such as the smoothies, the quinoa bites, and lets not forget the strawberry smores.  I am not supposed to have chocolate although I perodically do so this will be one of the times that acid relfux bed dammed I will be making these.  I was happy when i got to the end of the book and not because it was over because i could have gone for a few more recipes but because the information i was wondering about you had in detail for me for each of the recipes.  The only thing i would recommend outside of a few more good recipes is to let us know how much is considered a serving for each item.  You tell us how much the recipe makes but as a person dieting and only allowed a certain amount of calories a day this information is critical.  Great job and i look foward to the next one but more so to trying some of thse out.  I have never had tofu but that pudding does look good.  :)
0,Started a little slow and Elle playing victim all of the time gets old but luckily it picked up. Leo told her his true feelings and wants to take her home to Montovia to meet PaPa Bear. Leo showed his true feelings for Elle my picking her over his family and lifestyle so part 5 will be a hit I just have to be patient.	I got this book for giving an honest review. It is not a stand alone books you must read the books all together. Great Book!!!!
0,Well done Jj ! I could not put my kindle down, because I was on the edge of my seat to find out what would happen. And you didn't disappoint!
0,This was a cute novel, that reminded me of some of the restaurants where I have worked....Almost. Love the cat characters too!
0,Another great book
0,Eve didn't have a chance to fight what was between her and Brett.  they both feel hard and fast.  feels good to be loved.
0,Great writing and content.
0,Loved the book with all the events taking place. The characters showed their experiences with other people to be not what they expected as they got to know the other. The groom was still grieving over his dead wife blaming himself for her drowning which made it hard on the Bride to be as she got to know them. A must read for those who enjoy historical western romance kindle books from Amazon at a special price and from a delightful author who keeps me entertained throughout the entire book before putting it down. A great book.
0,ATR is one of the most commonly used indicators that traders use to measure volatility.  This book gives examples, talks about placing stops, determining position size, estimating profit and other useful tips and warnings.  I thought it was easy to read and understand.
0,All I can say is pride is a bitch! Just when I thought Juicy and Gino would finally be able to put their life together they were thrown a serious curveball. I'm not sure if the organization can be truly trusted but for the time being they seem cool. Pluto, Ace and Monique all need to sit their simple asses down somewhere and stop thinking they're entitled to what G left behind. Nae-Nae needed to be slapped for running her mouth so much. I couldn't take Pit serious and I can't believe Quese would be so stupid when Juicy has always been good to her. I hope Pit gets a major dose of karma. Salida is a trip. I'm mad her family is keeping her in the dark about Gino and madder that Monique would fill her head with bull for her own benefit. I'm ready to jump right in part 2 because things are surely about to heat up.
0,I couldn't put. The book down a great read. Castle was a crazy jawn, I loved grip and Kirby. Poor lucky tho
0,A wonderful telling of the beginning of the end of days. As a Christian reading about the Jewish Aliyah was hard at first,yet it is such a wonderful story with such balanced views that I was fully enthralled.	Ruth's journey and strife as she leaves her Jewish heritage for the call oh Yeshua was moving.	This very relevant story shows a very real near future.
0,I love Scarletts  books. The  rescue bear series is a great addition. Thanks for weighting them. Good luck on more gear books.
0,Ellas Gifts blends romance with a stalking psychopath. Ella, nurse without parents, meets a studly guy with all the equipment. Through many obstacles they couple gloriously. But the horror of the psychopath pervades her life.		 The story of this nurse, though at times slow and without the and then, and then suspense one fervently desires, the wrap-up is satisfying--but leaves open the somewhat implausible possibility of a future visit by her insane nemesis.		The author is to be congratulated upon crafting a plotline that satisfies on many levels while scaring the bejesus out of the reader.
0,This book was a wonderful surprise!  I can't remember how it got on my TBR list, but I'm happy it did!  The story was well plotted, carefully crafted, and ultimately told in significant detail, enough for you to care that the h, Aubrey and the H, Will get their HEA.  This was a really good read and I totally recommend it!
0,Another recommended read by a fairly new author. This book was filled with drama & the characters were believable. The storyline kept my interest from cover to cover. I found myself cussing & fussing some of these characters out! Trying not to give the storyline away so im just gonna say you definitely need to read this for yourself. Good job Nia! Waiting on part 2 to see what could possibly happen next!
0,This book was H.O. T.  !	Sandra, the leading lady, is blessed to live most women's fantasy.  Having not 1 but 2 edible men loving her like she's  God's gift to them. Can you say Yummy?!?!.. and "Me too, please ".. Ohh yeah !
0,By Proxy is book one is the Heart of Montana series by Katy Regnery.  This is my first book by Ms. Regnery.  And I really, really enjoyed it.  It won't be my last.  Even though this is a romantic Christmas story, I found the writing to be poetic and lyrical.  I loved her vivid descriptions.		Jenny Lindstrom is most definitely a small town girl.  She grew up in Gardiner, Montana, only leaving to attend college in Great Falls.  She loved Great Falls and planned to stay after graduation to start a career as a school teacher.  But, her mother became ill and soon passed away so Jenny went back home to her father and three brothers.  I found Jenny to be somewhat nave, as far as romance goes anyway.  Her beliefs are very old fashioned.  She has not even seriously dated.  But on the flip side, shes a tough 24 year old girl.  How could she not be being the youngest with three older brothers?  So she is somewhat hesitant to help out her best friend who is currently deployed to Germany.  Her friends fianc is also deployed to Afghanistan and they want/need to get married.  So they have asked the two most important people in their lives to stand proxy for them.  Jenny always thought the only time she would say those words, I Do, would be at her own wedding.  But her friend needs her and she will not let her down.		Sam Kelley is the complete opposite to Jenny.  He is an investment banker and lives the high life in Chicago.  He has a fancy apartment, goes to all the hottest clubs and restaurants, dates famous women, and loves his life.  He works hard and plays hard.  His cousin has asked him to fly to Montana to stand proxy for his wedding.  Sam and his cousin are very close so he does not hesitate.  But when he walked in to the courthouse and first laid eyes on Jenny he couldn't be more surprised.  He was also an hour late and the judge did not wait for him.  So Sam is forced to spend the weekend in Montana to wait for Monday to keep his word to his cousin.  His first impression of Jenny was snippy and bitter.  She was so frustrated with him for being late.  But, the more time they spent together, the more he realized he was wrong.		No one had ever gotten under his skin as fast as Jenny did today.  How was it possible?  Hed only met her six hours ago?  It felt like hed known her far longer.  She was totally and completely genuine.		She is not for you, man.  Shes not for you.		As the weekend went by, Sam was forced to take a good look at his own life in Chicago.  He was forced to re-evaluate everything he thought was important.  The more he got to know Jenny, the more he realized how special she was.  But his life is in Chicago, not in this tiny little town.  Could Jenny ever leave and move her life to Chicago?  He kept telling himself it would never work but his heart said something else.		As their weekend drew to a close, their lives and hearts were forever changed.  Could they ever find a common ground on which to explore their feelings for one another?		I think what I loved about this book is that no matter how worldly Sam thought he was, when it came right down to it, thats not at all what his heart wanted.  He wanted what his parents had, a best friend, a love to last a life time.  Not fancy dresses, a life in the public, but a home, children, the whole white picket fence deal.  So even though I have never heard of a double proxy wedding, I found this book to be really sweet and refreshing and a perfect Christmas time read.
0,I really enjoyed this book.  It was funny and had me laughing out loud quite a bit.  Joseph and Devyn had great chemistry and were a perfect match.  The relationship between them was Fast & Furious fast, but it was cool.  I look forward to reading Justin & Toni's story.
0,As always I love this series and monica doesn't disappoint with this installment.  I loved seeing everyone with their life mates and a glimpse into their lives.  It was also great to meet Raphael and Louisa.  I look forward to the next craziness of the next book.  The author had me crying at the end for Samuel and Martina.
0,Good , remembers me on the movie FURY with Brad Pit.....
0,Grant and Lacey finally realize that they love each other and work together to get his godmother plan to overtake the company exposed.
0,I enjoyed this humorous book. The author has a breezy, fun style and I would like to read more from her.
0,Im a firm fan of Lynda Aicher and her writing. Ive loved what books I have read of the Wicked Play series and Im enjoying the hockey infused Power Play series.	Back in Play was a different read for me in many ways; it gave me a much-needed break from my new adult stories and it also covered real issues that I hadnt read about in a romance book before.		Scott Walters lives and breathes hockey. So much so, hed do just about anything to keep himself in the game, even if that means endangering his health and going down a dark, slippery path. Scott wants more than just hockey though, and when he meets Rachel, she ignites his dreams for an idyllic future. Scotts convinced he can have both but when it comes down to it, one is more dangerous than the other.		Rachel Fielding is the last singleton amongst her friends and can often be the butt of a joke. So when she meets Scott Walters, he seems to good to be true, and he is because he lives 1000 miles away and Rachel has sworn off long distance relationships. After convincing herself a week long fling will be enough, she gives into Scotts charm but when Rachel discovers all of Scotts secrets she finds it impossible to walk away when their time is up.		"She was in so much trouble. Way past resisting him, it was now a matter of how hard she fell and how much the landing would hurt."		I love the way in which this series is connected to the Wicked Play books, its not necessary to have read them first but its a nice little bonus if you have because some characters feature and I love the way in which they are entwined.		As I mentioned previously, I liked the issues raised in this book and how they were portrayed, its not often the heros masculinity is potentially threatened but Lynda did this in a way that was real and honest. Both Rachel and Scott were in their mid thirties and yearning for their dream future but both had obstacles to confront in order to achieve it.		I read this book in half a day; I was sucked in by the first page and couldn't put Rachel and Scotts story down. This book can be read as a standalone so if you haven't started this series then I suggest you do so! ~Ava		*I received a copy in exchange for an honest review*
0,Prince Edward is the illegitimate son of the King and although he loves the monetary aspects, he wants nothing to do with the title. He is living the wild life of a single rich playboy. Rose is back living with her parents after breaking up with her cheating boyfriend, she is a little down but pressing on until she can get back on her feet. Her sister employed her to take random pictures of celebrities who frequent her club but Rose has been so out of touch that she is clueless about who they are. Her ex becomes a stalker, ok this real-life scenario has always baffled me....if he wanted her so much why did he cheat??, smh...men! Anyway... these two unlikely characters happen to "see" one another, lol. This story is hilarious, I love a romance with humor. Great story, love it, couldn't put it down. It has the perfect mix of family drama, secrets & love!!!
0,This is a very sweet little book about, as you would suppose, learning the letters of the alphabet. It is a cut above the average A is for Apple - B is for Bat. On each page, short sentences begin repeatedly with "I love", and the word corresponding with the specific letter has to be searched for (a nice simple exercise as there are no more than five words on the page). The words chosen are imaginative and the illustrations are creative. Though, I did think the page with the letter Z might be confusing for small children.
0,This is an awesome series, and to get the box set for 4.99 is an incredible deal.  The Torrent Witches series is not "cookie cutter" as so many witch cozy series are today.  The characters are easy to become involved with.  (I had no idea what a slip witch was until I started this series.)  You develop a vested interest in their lives and the lives of their loved ones.  One minute you'll be laughing out loud, while your family looks at you like you've lost your mind, and the next you'll be worrying about what's going to happen and who it's going to happen to.  If you haven't read the series, the box set is a great way to get started, you won't have to worry about getting out of order and you definitely want to read this series in order.
0,This book is quite straightforward - funny quotes. I use quotes in my books frequently so when I discovered that this was floating around out there it was a Godsend. Aside from the pleasant chuckles, it is going to help me on my latest. Shetty has found a small niche that many of us can use for all kinds of purposes. Well done!
0,Slow start and seemingly change of story. Need to stick with it through some lengthy explanations.  Last half very worth your time.
0,I loved reading this story! This is the first historical shifter book that I have ever read. It gives you a new perspective on shifters. I can't wait to read the next part.
0,I love Science fiction and I also love detective novels. This one has a bit of both, which makes me happy. It's a great story to read filled with interesting characters and action. Jim Meade makes me laugh, and I appreciate that in a book. I'm just starting the sequel to this story and look forward to reading more from this author.
0,Wonderful novel!  From the beginning to the ending page, I thoroughly enjoyed this story! I can't wait for the next book in this, series!
0,This book is divided into 2 sections.  Part 1 is crock pot meals.  They're not specialty diet recipes, but good old stick-to-your-ribs meals.  I counted 35 of them of which most were really good.  I liked the recipes for French Dip, Cherry Croissant Pudding, Mexican Chicken Fajita Casserole, French Onion Soup, Mac & Cheese, Hash Brown Casserole, and the Chocolate Mocha Bread Pudding for starters...yum.  Pretty much all of the ingredients are in you kitchen, or local grocery.  This section had great variety, and easy directions.  Part 2 dealt with grain-free dishes.  Although there were 41 recipes, I only found a couple keepers that appealed to me...the Parmesan Mushroom Quinoa, Apple Sausage, and the Chicken Salad (with apples, raisins, and pecans).  There were several recipes for grain-free breads made with coconut/almond/ or arrowroot flour.  This is a pretty good cookbook, especially if you like to start dinner in the morning and come home to a fully prepared meal.  Disclosure:  I recieved this item for free in return for a honest review and my opinion of the contents and value of the item.  The opinions and values are my own.

0,If you enjoy the Legend series and Through Time series you'll love this prequel of Queen Aaibhe and come to understand her better.  A great quick read! Written after the legend series, it can be read before or after.  I read it after and it gave me wonderful insight to her.
0,I got Call Me Cat for free but I willingly paid for Leave Me Love and loved it more than the first.  I thought when I downloaded it that it was going to be too short but there was more action and plot twists than in the first.  I kept thinking something wasn't right thru this book and kind of expected the cliffhanger at the end.  I think I have a clue about what is coming because it all boils down to trusting the wrong person. The sins of the fathers and mothers...  Now I am impatiently awaiting book 3 which says it is due in April.  I just hope they don't mean the 30th!  I can't wait that long.  Give this trilogy a chance if you are trying to decide.
0,I couldn't put these books down and can't wait to read more
0,I am not a person who generally likes to read the sequels. But after reading the first in The Energy Chronicles series, I knew I wanted to read this one. Luckily I am in receipt of a gift of the second novel in the trilogy from the author.		Lilian and Brighton, who grew up together, meet at a later age and marry in the first novel, are now moving into a new stage in their lives. Together they have conquered the evil people in their homeland and have set out, with friends, to build a new home in a new locale.		Leaving their home in the small village of Four Mountains, they have journeyed over the mountains to a new life. But with Brighton and Lilian both having special gifts, life can never be easy. No matter where they go their gifts will bring them both success and heartbreak. As Brighton feels the full range of his power he makes a mistake and uses it without complete knowledge of the situation. This mistake causes ramifications that are far reaching. Instead of the peace they longed for they are now in a life and death situation.		Again, working together, they must find the way to peace and tranquility not only in their environment but in their hearts.		Birth of a Wizard works well as the second in the series but is a complete novel on its own. While reading the first leads the reader into the story it is not necessary. The mark of a good author. The back stories of the characters are added when needed and appropriate and there is no long monologue in the beginning to set up the story. Errors are few and those that are present don't jar the reader out of the suspension of disbelief.		Well written, but and as long as the first in the series, the author keeps the tension building with skill. The story is believable and the settings are described with ease. The reader may find himself falling into the world of witches, fairies and magical powers without even noticing. Wait, did I say magic? Is there magic here?		With battles, contests of powers, mythological creatures and a sweeping landscape the story is a fantasy lover's delight.		For all lovers of fantasy and magical characters (there is that word again) this is a good read that we recommend. This is still an 18+ for us for adult sexual situations.		Karen Bryant Doering,	Parents' Little Black Book
0,This book is about Wes Pearce and his road to becoming what's known as, a "real man." He reflects back on his own life, and how he became the man he is today. It's about what leads him to find the women he comes in contact with, and how he became the sexual man he is today. You can see that as he gets older, and with today's generational gap, he becomes more and more sexual as he finds himself.		This book is almost written like a memoir of sexual tales and experiences. I found it to be entertaining and realistic of today's young adults with their sexual stories. The book continues to tell the stories of his one night stands and how he views the women he is with.		Of course this book isn't for the who can't handle reading about sexual encounters or crude incidents from a male's point of view. Most people can handle reading the same experiences, if they're written from a female point of view, but not necessarily a male's since they are presumed to be more sexual and vulgar. I find that either man or woman, the experiences are to be the same and shouldn't be judged on a person's gender. Overall I give this book a 4/5.
0,If you have not read anything from Connie Shuttle, I suggest starting at the beginning with 'Blood Wager'. This book is actually a look back at how Adam Chessman became Saa Thalarr. Also, how he and Kiarra became mates. It answers many questions that were only hinted at in previous books. I love that the details are being filled in, and want to scream at Griffin and Merrill for all the mistakes they are making. I'm glad we got to know Joey more. He is such a sweet guy and had never been a main character up to this point. If you love Connie's other books, then you have to read 'Hope and Vengeance'. As always, I can't wait for more!
0,I loved reading Ask Me Nicely (Entangled Brazen) (Naughty or Nice), all about Sally Kennedy the vet & Doyle Jackson the temporary vet whose filling in for a few months. Sally is attracted to Doyle but won't allow herself to let him know. You see six years ago she lost her husband Ben & unborn eight month old baby girl Zelda in a horrific car accident! She's functioning better now, but she's starting to have feelings and she can't ever live thru another tragedy again. The author wrote an amazing emotional story, and the characters absolutely make the story come to life! Read this book and follow Doyle & Sal around and see what happens! It will make you laugh, cry, sigh, shake your head and cum up a storm! Enjoy reading this book, because I certainly enjoyed reading it!
0,Great book. You will not find a book like this online, at least i truly believe you won't. Very well written and easy to follow but especially and essentially is very useful and of great help in this subject. Thank you.
0,Awesome series!!!!
0,WOW!!!! This book shows you that everyone can change. Its great to see a writer that can do a romance and a shifter  that show that people can change there way of thinking. I am so glad I read this book I love it. Sarah Makela is a great writer I love her writings and they seem to be getting better as the writing goes on with everyone of her books. I highly recommend this book for people who want to believe others can change. Thank you very much Sarah Makela for writing it.
0,A nice sweet little fun read. I also really enjoyed the preview of her other book and will check it out later
0,Excellent Ripper tale.  Hits all the bases and blends several accounts for balance.  Lestrade in his blundering common sense manner, Ill equipped by educational shortcomings, yet still manages to throw himself through the right doorways and into bodily injuries and new insights.  Enjoyable crime solving, set against a backdrop of Holmes and Watson elementary seasonings.  MJ Trow has enticed me to choose another of these historical romps through crime.  Bravo, Lestrade.
0,Harold 7th Earl of Wycliffe wants to get Wycliffe House ,back from Lord Tremaine, who caused his father's death and stole his home from his father. Louisa Phillyps' father sold her to Godwin  Phillyps,a vile man, for 1000 pounds.  She hates her father and her unscrupulous husband.  The story is about how they go about finding who owns the house and the problems they go through to find out.  The story is very good,  as all Bolen story's are,  her characters have many facets to their characters.  It is  very good read, which is normal for all Bolens book	Germaine Rosenquist
0,Don't usually read mermaids stories, but this one was unusual and different. The characters were well developed and completely different than what I expected. Really enjoyed this story.
0,Tenaya Jayne has an amazing, twisted, darkly optimistic imagination! She has woven a complex world where right struggles to reign and unlikely heroes influence the outcome of events. Forest's story intertwines with Neriet's and Merick's in this page-turner. And the cliffhanger! Can't wait for the next book.
0,Fun read. Leaves you in a good mood when done.
0,I'm familiar with the Quran, but this story had giving me an insight of what more the denominations have to offer. Great read and great teaching!
0,First one negative thing,  sorry but the F word was just not necessary!		That said the story was so incredibly intense, filled with so much sadness.  Yet finally Annie learned what was most important between her and Ryan.  They sure went through an awful lot to get to the real task of their lives together.		Brendan and Chevonne ... Oh my word, what torchere they went through because of lies and misunderstandings.  Theirs was the most honest love in both books yet was almost destroyed because of Daniel and Annie's life long feud.		Thankfully the truth came out!  What truth?  That readers you will have to get the book and read it for yourselves to find out.  I cannot express how many times I cried throughout this story as well as the first book Dream Time.  I'm sure you will enjoy them both.		Starr as Ruby Slippers
0,It was wonderful & exciting. 5 stard
0,What a concept, dragons and humans. Each needing the other to heal, love and live. Great story of good vs evil too. Enjoyable!
0,The girls continue to rock the world in this lovely series. I anxiously await the next title. Keep them coming (pun intended) ladies!
0,I was first thinking that Graison had forgotten about the Rancher. Good to see that all the brothers found a good woman and continue to have a happy life through all the trails and troubles that had to go through. The Willow Creek Series is one of the best so for that I read. Continue the good work.
0,I cannot get enough of this series. Susan Hatler draws in her audience with characters you just cant help falling in love with. In book 3 its Charlie's time to shine. After the end of her marriage Charlie is nursing her wounds, back in her hometown of Blue Moon Bay. Desperate for money to keep her beloved house. She has two choices, either let Greta Von Strand write a tell all on her ex husband.	Or rent out her house to the soap opera Just one love. Charlie is just too decent to rat out her ex Rex Rockwell. So her only choice is renting out her house. Of course its a big plus she is a fan of the show and a fan of the delectable Luke Montgomery. While watching a scene being filmed, Charlie gets a chance to step into the soap opera world, when a cast member doesn't turn up.	When Charlie and Luke meet on screen the whole room can feel the chemistry between them.	So much so that Charlies character gets given more air time. I loved the romance between Charlie and Luke. Poor Charlie has had a number done on her by her ex, its going to take a special someone and alot of soul searching before she gets to her happy place. This book will make you sigh with the romance of it all and laugh at the clumsiness of Charlie. I found the soap opera scenes were really interesting, i hope Just one love is back in another book. The magic of blue moon bay strikes again.	Grab a copy of this book you won't be disappointed.	Arc received from author in exchange for a fair review.
0,Fun book to read, was a little dry in some spots but worth finishing. I plan on finishing the series
0,Absolutely fantabulous. And what a twist it gives. Gotta love those badboys. They really have some style... and delicious... um... TOYS
0,Another great story from Elle!!!  She did a wonderful job with this book.  Can't wait for another story from Montana Double Riders or from the club in  Colorado.  Good job!!!
0,So sweet and hot, enjoying Clytie and Demons HEA getting better and better and revisiting the other couples.	Highly recommended
0,I enjoyed this mail order bride book. It had some great elements. It's hard to find well written mail order bride stories. This one was a little scattered in places but had a good story and the characters were well done. These are not long novels but take a couple hours to read. I wish we had heard a little more of the sisters story, I thought this would be about the tow of them but all the focus was on one sister. This is a clean romance but there is a lot of talk of intimacy between the two that makes this an adult read.
0,Beautiful poetry, quotations and photographs make this a lovely unique gift for my mum. It's Inspiring, uplifting and somehow comforting. I just know she'll love it.
0,Short books are a great thing to have in digital print, especially when it comes to reading on a daily commute and The Storm: Episode 1 is no exception to this. Having a longer story broken down into episodes is an easy way to digest a narrative and much more palatable to a generation that has been raised on the episodic nature of television.	The essence of the book is survival, and like many survival themed stories, there is a natural disaster involved that sends the world into chaos. Some of the other books in this genre focus too much on the details of the disaster, making it wholly unbelievable and not investing enough in the development of characters. The Storm: Episode 1 avoids this trap with the details of the magnetic storm causing chaos across the world being given without being too heavy, but in depth enough to make the storm sound believable.	The characters of Kate, John and David are well written, each having a very different background and experiences, making them three-dimensional without adhering to stereotypes too much  though there were some clichd elements involved in the character creation, Ive yet to find a character in modern literature who doesnt have some form of stereotype woven into their personality somehow.	There is plenty of intrigue to keep most readers happy and with two further volumes promised, there is certainly enough contained within these pages to have readers coming back for more once they have flicked through the first volume.	For a short read it is excellent and will hold your attention from start to finish, you will find that the pages turn at a quicker rate than you would expect as the story carries you through. For readers used to much longer and fleshed out volumes, you may find it slightly disappointing as there are moments when you find yourself wanting a little bit more for the writing.	On the whole and excellent novella that was thoroughly enjoyable.
0,Was intriguing and interesting story that I've read in a long time, it kept me reading until the end of this story!!!!
0,Missing Dead or Alive leads the reader through the parents' anguish when their promising fourteen year old son disappears along with money from his mother's purse and a raid on her bank card which appears to indicate his disappearance is intentional. The impact on their lives and relationship as time goes by results in them separating and finding happiness with other partners.	Five years go by and Tim turns up unannounced. The devastation that ensues turns their worlds upside down and ends with a horrifying climax. This is not a son anyone would want in their lives and begs the question of nature or nurture?	Peter Martin has written a book with many twists and turns that could have many readers looking over their shoulders at their own kids. Read it if you dare.
0,5 Crazy Ass Stars!!!!!		I love this series! I don't want to slip and leave a spoiler so I will say that this is a Crazy Ass Must Read!!!!!
0,This writer has the ability to pull the reader into her writing, holding back enough of the details to gain interest but not enough to completely understand the underlying story line... In fact, she has broken her books down into sections of, the first being less than 100 pages...I got the first one and frankly was surprised that it turned out to be a vampire story... Why? Because of the way the book was written, and the unique details and "names" which, for me, were new to the lexicon for vampire novels... By the end of the book, the author had won me over and I suggest that, if you are into vampires, this may be just the story that will be just as new and intriguing for you as it was for me...		Briefly the life story for Sadie is that she lives with Wendy, a Wicca, who has become a close friend. She has just lost her job at a bookstore, which was sold surprisingly quick by the owner. Neither she nor Marco, a friend and supervisor at the store know what happened... Fortunately, Sadie was able to get another job quickly...especially since the "real" story is just beginning...		Sadie has begun to dream... of a man...		Now, once the paranormal stuff started, I was hooked... A perfectly average girl, worried over getting her car fixed, finding a new job...and having enough to eat, suddenly is caught in dreams that take her to various places around the world. She is only able to recognize the potential location because of the setting in which she finds herself...		I was enthralled with the idea, even though I've read similar dream-theme books, it was the author's writing that was able to sustain the suspense for me, to draw it out without becoming excessive in duplicating scenes to which she traveled...		But what happens when the dreams become so real that you spend your waking hours watching for him on the streets or where you work, or live?		And what happens when he starts holding, touching you in your dreams...		And then she saw him on the streets!		WHEW! I've got to say that this is a sexy little story, but it is so romantically written that some of you may even swoon--at least those who, like me, know what swoon means! LOL...Actually, I've never fainted in my life, but you get my meaning, don't you? The story is exciting, suspenseful, and just enough of the feel of the paranormal that, as a reader, you are ready for anything and everything that might happen...		But I really don't think you'd even guess as to what's coming next or what you learn about Sadie...		Enjoy! You know you want to read it!		GABixlerReviews
0,I absolutely love this game.  Unfortunately I have already gotten through two of the levels and know there are not an unending supply.  The instructions were really easy to follow and the further you go along the more challenging it is.  I hope kindle comes out with more games like this and Triple Town.
0,I have read this series from the beginning. I loved it! Now this book released and the series keeps getting better and better.
0,This was such a sweet, happy book I loved it. The story of Mina who's expecting her first baby with Matt the bear shifter who's her fated mate. The time is near for the birth when all of a sudden Mina has disappeared and Matt and friends are out looking for her. This is a great shifter, mystery, fun story.  I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a fun book.
0,I cannot write enough praise for Ava March. I love her stories, her characters & her steamy love scenes. I am looking forward to more of her books. Thank you, Ava.

It was a wonderful thing to have a book bring so many emotions pulled to the fore front while reading.
0,Loved this series
0,What a wonderful story!  I've read several books by Ms. Neal and in my opinion, this is her best work so far!  It's wonderful, in this day of drawn out multiple novels in a series with long intervals between releases, to get the complete story in this boxed set!  I love the depth of these characters who are both believable and lovable.  I seek out books written from multiple perspectives, and Ms. Neal's way of writing the characters' thoughts gives the reader more insight into the characters.  I don't often cry when reading, but I'll admit the last chapters had me reaching for the Kleenex!		I received an ARC in exchange for an honest review.
0,Saucy, sexy, and will suck you in. Would have loved to have seen more of this couple's journey, but wow sexy, sexy!
0,Great writer...!!!
0,Just the prologue itself is enough to pull you into this story. Redd is sweet as pie and with her home girl Konette beside her they have plans to take Redd's modeling career to the top. Konette is Redd's feisty business manager who also happens to be a great matchmaker. In comes Big Daddy Dell who changes Redd's life for the better or does he. The author takes you on a wild ride of the skeletons being tossed around in Redd's Hurricane. With all the love and attention she still indulges in a forbidden fruit, but both parties are responsible. Thus leading to several gruesome unexpected deaths. My face was totally screwed reading those scences..Yikes!!! Redd's thought process is on the fritz and she's absolutely sure her assumption is right. Thereby leaving Redd back in the arms of that Black pearl with blood now on her hands. Her Sexy Big Brother EL is still a hot head but that's to be expected after what they both went through. Redd faces alot of challenges and realize its time to change if not for herself then definitely for Evan. She confronts her truth and slowly her Hurricane is dismantled.
0,Great plot with endearing characters. Learning it was bases on true history was a bonus. I would recommend this series to anyone.
0,If You are a wife and a mother then you will probably relate to this book. I did so much!! It was like reading my life well I only have one child but U get the picture. Once you have been with someone a long time you can get in a rut and lose the desire you once had. This just comes from normal living. You must always try to spice it up. It keeps your relationship fresh and happy. It was wonderful reading about a husband who realized what his wife was missing and took steps to change it.*sighs* If only ..hints don't work ladies fyi. You really got to be blunt with men. I liked it so much I got another book from this author:) *hint hint Hubble lol*
0,Great read  .. Scarlett Avery  well done ... I love Ciara & Nikolaj ...  HOT HOT,  HOT & did I say HOT !!!!! ... I want more , can't wait for Book 6 .... Must read .. I read them in 2 days ..  Put this on you TBR list !!!
0,The Curious Case Of The Clockwork Menance was a wonderful little tease for the next book Forged by Desire. Nighthawks Perry and Garrett are looking into the case of a missing actress. This is not a romance but we get a glimpse into Perry's hidden feelings for her partner and a scare has him on the verge of seeing her in a different light as well. Can't wait for the rest of their story - think it is only a week to go. This story will probably work best for those readers who are at least a little familiar with  the alternate Victorian world of McMaster's London Steampunk series and vampiric upper class who are literally blue bloods.
0,4 Deluge of emotions STARS		I'd never heard of this author before but the book was brought to my attention by the publisher via Netgalley as she was compared to other authors that I like. This is what I call an unexpected gem. The blurb intrigued me and I went in with no expectations and came out of it all the more enriched.	For me, this was a  very deep and moving tale.  Holly Ward is a single mother of Drew, an  8 year boy, who is her life. Holly's life is hard as she struggles to make ends meet and tries her hardest to give Drew all of the important things in life although she wishes she could give him more.  Holly suffered under the thumb of a verbally abusive and manipulative ex-husband, Brett, Drew's father.  Holly left him, realizing she couldn't live that way and while Brett has remarried and supposedly moved on, this man is a constant thorn in her side and takes great pleasure in tearing her down.  Despite all of this, Holly is truly a strong woman with a good heart who has had her worth and sense of self shaken and has lost her confidence along the way.  Shes a damn good mother but questions it because of her ex's nasty words.	Then there's Ray Lopez, Holly's co-worker at Cogman's, a low cost superstore. Holly has noticed Ray but tries to keep her distant as she doesn't want another man and needs no more trouble. Ray notices Holly instantly but also reads her so well and knows he needs to be cautious with.  He's also lost and grappling with the recent loss of his mother.	Holly and Ray have a lot in common  two decent people trying to make a living, do good. Ray was raised by a single mother and recognizes Holly's plight to make ends meet and the love and dedication to her son.	I really enjoyed the premise of which their relationship unfolds as they buy a lottery ticket together and win. Becoming obscenely rich and as good as it sounds, think about what that does to your life? While drawn to each other, they're also shoved into the media spotlight and all of it is so overwhelming. And on top of it all, both of them believe, although Holly more so,  that their good fortune will not last.	Ray was such a sweet, raw and real man and his connection with Holly was moving.		I loved the growth and arc of Holly as she transformed and came into her true self.  I only wish we had more of it. More of Holly and Ray.	However, this was only a novella and so I knew it would be short but damn, it was sweet!
0,A beautiful touch of old school with contemporary Sci-fi elements.  Great character development and dialogue combined with seamless unfolding story lines. Looking forward to next installment!
0,This is not your typical love story In my opinion. It is a story about love, anguish, trust issues, betrayal, hurt, and maybe just maybe a happy ending if the two characters can get to the point to where they can communicate with one another.		Everyone believes that Archie is the perfect boyfriend. That he goes along with having a third in his and Zach's relationship when all along it was Archies idea in the first place. I do not think that Archie is a bad person but I do believe that he has lost perspective of his relationship and even though he says he tries in it, I do not think that he actually does. He just goes along with the flow for the most part but when Zach makes suggestions such as going away together Archie always has other things hat are more important. I think that Archie wants his and Zach's relationship to be better but he is scarf to communicate it with Zach and I also believe that it is easier for Archie to assume the worst of Zach then it is to actually trust that he would not betray him.		Zach is miserable. That I can tell from the start. He is not happy with the way things are going with him and Archie and when he tries to talk to Srchie about it, it ends in a fight and then they make up as if nothing has happened. And there lies one of the problems. Nothing is being fixed and it festers between the two of them and eventually turns them apart.		This book is full of accusations, mistrust, misunderstandings, pain, and heartache. But it is also full of hope and love. This was a great book with a lot of truth in it. Loved this read and look forward to more by AE Ryecart in the future.		Was given this book for free by inked rainbow reads for an honest review
0,I fell in love with Chris and Mia when Falling Stars was first released, as this was a while ago, I was so happy to be able to catch up with them.	Seeing the ups and downs of the wedding planning was certainly entertaining, it made me laugh on more than one occasion whilst there were also definite moments where I could quite easily strangle the pair.	A really great novella which took me right back to their original story, if you haven't read this yet then you really must.
0,My son downloaded this book after reading the first book in The Reset Gang series from this author. He loves anything Minecraft at the moment and Christopher Craft didn't disappoint him. The writing style is easy to read, unique and my son was fully absorbed from the very beginning. Its great to see my son taking a break from his computer games to read the authors different series. You are on a winner with your kids if you get them hooked on Christophers books.
0,I really enjoyed this one! Coming from a new to me author, I am looking forward to reading more from her. There was great character development, great pace, and a very enjoyable storyline making this an entertaining read start to finish. It's a second chance story between two people who have a lot to overcome before finding their HEA. As teenagers, Tyson "Blackbird" Blackwell is the son of a cop and Gabriella "Blue" Galecki is the daughter of a Mafia boss. A very unlikely pair but they seemed to be making it work. Until the day she disappears without a word leaving Tyson broken hearted but determined to move on. After ten years Gabriella has be called home by her father and the FBI need to find out why. That's where Tyson comes in. He's now working for the bureau and is determined to find out what's going on with Gabriella. He wants to know what happened in the past as well as her plans for the future. As well as how her father fits into all the drama they have shared.		Definitely a good read and one I would recommend.
0,I liked this book a lot and can't wait to find out what happens next at Silver Star!
0,This book had a going d story line. I would recommend books 1 and 2 . I am starting on book 3.
0,So I have been getting bored with my salad. But I have been short on time lately. I needed something to be efficient but not end up tossing a whole bag of salad away. With this mason jar method, I can now have no excuse for more veggies. Thank you for writing this book.
0,The author does a really good job of showing the growing relationship between the two main characters. There are a lot of twists and turns in the story line that keeps your interest throughout your reading. I give it five stars. SHEILA HUNTINGTON, author of JADE, MORNING GLORY WOMAN, ALWAYS HOLD THE RIBBON and MURDER IN DILWORTH.
0,Enjoyed this very much (the first book I've read by Sydney Somers). Shifters that turn into gargoyles with King Arthur legends, a little sword and sorcery and romance. Well written 1st book of a new series.
0,I really enjoyed the story.  Characters were likable.  Look forward to more from S. Vernon
0,I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.		This was a great boxset, and I enjoyed all four stories. The couples in each story were adorable and fun to read about. I also really liked that the shifters were saber-tooth tiger shifters. I haven't found many books with that version of shifters, and it's a nice change of pace. I'm looking forward to reading more books by this author.
0,love this book read all three right away. I would have forgiven Derek. not slept with Ryan.
0,I have been a fan of hers for decades.  Never get tired of reading her tales over again and who could read her without delving into the Witch World.  I think it is fabulous that her works are being offered up to the new generations of readers once again.  I only hope they enjoy her as much as I have over the years.  She entered into a field of SF authors that was male dominated and showed that writing in this venue is not just for men.  This book has so many of her well known pieces I hope any who look for a recommendation on this opt to purchase.
0,Thea and Ewan had a history, and he's the last person she wants to see, his cousin and her bestie are one in the same and after a fire at the restaurant where she looses her job goes back home to work in her besties family restaurant. Her one stipulation is don't tell Ewan.	One day of being back they run into each other.	Thea is still hurt that he broke up with her, she's been unable to move on and Ewan feels the same he didn't want to end things but at the time felt he had no choice.	Now however he wants her back and won't let anything or anyone stop them being together.	I love shifter books and enjoyed this novella my only wish was that it was longer, some things felt a bit rushed for me. I will definitely be watching for more in this series
0,This book has me thinking about my life with God. The things Chrystal endured omg , only God could see her through. I loved how she handle it all, but depending totally on him. She even help others to follow him. Priceless!  I was sad when her brother, Jace's mother, and donovan died . I pray God strengthen the families. I didn't like that it ended without Chrystal and her papa not seeing her parents together thi. All together, I enjoyed all the books.
0,I have really enjoyed this series and am looking for more as they come out.  Looking forward to reading more.
0,Que gusta es una historian lleva de mucha tension por que tu no sabe lo que va a pasar pero es muy hermosa
0,Billy has come into his own, at 14 he is strong and honest.  He is struggling through his first crush.  He thinks that Rebecca hiding something bad from him.	So he goes to his family of seals for help.		Rebecca is quiet and smart, she is trying to graduate early and get emancipated to get away from the foster care system.  With a little help from Billy's family it just might happen.  Plus she gets to be around Billy.		I was gifted this book for an honest review!
0,Mandi did a great job keeping you on your toes as she finished the story of Deacon and Frankie. She finds a way to make you feel the haunting of Andrew and fear deep in your bones. She breaks your heart. Then she lets that all be eclipsed by the strongest love ever and brings in the light.	This was one of the most perfect love stories, you see true life struggles every couple's deals with but love prevails and it makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
0,This is my first book by Abbey Foxx, and I have to say that I am not disappointed.  A pro Rugby player turned football player. Jasper is one heck of a character, with his bad boy looks and bad jokes. The story was fresh, and very entertaining. It was really hard to put down once I started reading it. I am looking forward to reading a whole lot more by this author. I  received  an  ARC  copy  of  this  book  for  an  honest  review.
0,Allison never seen this wild side of her. Riley had to have her Hunter did to but Riley walks in on her and Hunter. She thinks all she want is sex but she is getting in a lot deeper.
0,Very real and should make anyone give the idea of preparing a very serious thought!
0,I love Benny's story.  He's not a shifter, but he is, and his mate is special too.  This story was so sweet.  I love the way he bakes for her, but is too worried to be near enough for her to see him.  And then it turn out that it doesn't matter.  This part of the trilogy had less steam than the other too, but it was very sweet.  I was glad they finally got rid of the thing that was plaguing the area.  This was a fun read.
0,I was a little Leary on this set of books but I was wrong...I loved it	I will re-read this trio of books...
0,I was surprised when I started to read this book how much I couldn't stop reading. The story of a small town with a surprising twist was fun to discover.
0,Good book look forward to reading more
0,"And Saul's servants said to him, 'Surely, a distressing spirit from God is troubling you.'" -- 1 Samuel 16:15 (NKJV)		Although I didn't give this book the top rating, I certainly recommend that anyone who is a 39 clues fan read it. Important developments in the story occur here. I've done my best not to include spoilers . . . and I pray that I have succeeded.		The Dead of Night is one of those episodes in the 39 clues where your stomach may not be fully comfortable as you read about the events. As the book's blurb indicates, at the book's beginning Atticus Rosenbloom, Dan Cahill's eleven-year-old best friend, has been kidnapped by the Vespers. An angry Jake Rosenbloom, Atticus's brother, doesn't make saving Atticus any easier for Amy and Dan Cahill.		The book also sheds more light on the fate of the seven captives, which adds to the tension. Vesper One again shows his ruthlessness in putting pressure on Amy and Dan to do his will.		In the background, Dan grows in determination to bring down the Vespers. In the process, he's troubled by information that he doesn't quite know what to do with.		The story also requires Amy and Dan to retrieve another difficult object, one that will expand the geographical and historical horizons of almost all readers . . . of any age.		While the writing is certainly very fine, I felt a little let down by the plot, which seemed to be a bit too easy to anticipate in places. See what you think.
0,I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN!!  Is Star as strong as she thinks she is!  Does she love Jake!  Can she hold out until he finds her??  Will her brother be her down fall!!
0,This is such a great book for helping anyone think about what they want to be, do and have. Choices are so important in life so getting started  early with considering the options of the choice is a great idea. Wonderful illustrations, nice rhyming, easy to read. Recommended.
0,As a Service Dog user, I was especially touched reading this book. The details of Tuesday's training and then his partnership with Luis Carlos Montalv&aacute;n were poignant and absorbing.	As Captain Montalv&aacute;n talks about his experiences that brought him to where he is, the reader gains a deeper understanding of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Traumatic Brain Injury, and how these impact Montalv&aacute;n's life.	The reader also learns how a sensitive, intelligent dog is almost broken, and in his healing, how he helps others heal.	A wonderful book worth more than 5 stars.
0,Close to Home, by Megan Nugen Isbell, is the sixth book in the Home series.  This is a contemporary romance story that is unforgettable and breathtaking in its delivery. Close to Home is Gracie Baylor's story. Megan Nugen Isbell continues to amaze with her stories in this series.  They are emotionally rich, highly intriguing and inspiring all in their own.		Best friends, Gracie Baylor and Wyatt Seaver, are back in Carver, Kansas  home for the summer from college.  However, that friend dynamic is about to be shifted and challenged.  What does that mean for them and their friendship?		Gracie Baylor is a lovable character.  She is connected to her family and they mean the world to her.  It comes through so strongly in this story.  She is compassionate and truly inspiring.  This is Gracie's chance to discover herself and what truly matters to her, what she needs to be happy and be just her.  As for Wyatt, he has similar characteristics to Gracie, it is part of how I see they make such wonderful friends.  Yet, at the same time, Wyatt is torn in his life and needs to make a decision  one that has the potential to change everything.		I have enjoyed reading each book in the Home series.  The fact that Megan Nugen Isbell is able to carry the theme across multiple stories and books with overlapping characters is well delivered.  This story was an emotional read and I look forward to seeing how this series continues in the remaining book(s) of the series.
0,Youve got to read this book. Parker is by far my favorite and he and macy gave me an emotional story.
0,But a good story. The characters are lovable and funny the story cute. Very clean in content with little to no action. I am interested to see what the other books are about. This seems like a stand alone book.
0,Do you want to feel like a million, or better yet look like it. I just experienced Amy Waldow's new book, 55 Fun & Fabulous DIY Beauty Recipes that incorporates natural homemade recipes for the skin, hair and nails. I say experienced for it is more than words on a page, but natures ingredients that heal, restore and make your skin radiant.  I know, for I just experienced the Maple Oatmeal Facial Scrub that's not only all natural, but soothing and great for my dry skin. The oats in this soothing facial mask are natural cleansers that gently scrub away dirt and excess oil, while the antioxidant-rich maple syrup restores natural moisture.		There is something for everyone in Amy's book where making your own natural skin products is a safe, natural, cost-effective alternative to chemical-laden, skin care products.  This is a comprehensive resource guide to create 55 easy, step by step natural, organic recipes for skin, hair and nail treatments that not only smell divine, but are excellent for your health and well-being. After reading Amy's first book, 77 Outrageously Effective Anti-Aging Tips & Secrets I knew I was in good hands; from a former Holistic Esthetician, who has worked in the skin care industry for a number of years and is dedicated in the fields of health, wellness and anti-aging. If you want to look good and feel great pick this book up and get started now.
0,~4  Sensual Stars~	*I was given a complimentary copy by the author in exchange for an honest review.*		WOW!!!! Who knew a love story between an oracle and a demon could be so HOT? As I began My Decadent Demon, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. However, after reading the first few paragraphs, I was hooked.		Seraphina, Sera, is an oracle in training who has the gift of foresight, and one of the first visions she sees is a sexy as sin demon, Cole. However, she doesnt know he is a demon; she just knows that his destiny is linked to hers. She sets off to find him in the human world, and he is even more spectacular in person. When the two meet, they begin a sexy, torrid affair until she realizes what he truly is. Of course, her being an angel and him being a demon would never work in her eyes, so she leaves him. Fast forward 100 years later, and she hasn't been able to forget him. Meanwhile, he has been living half a life without his angel. She hunts him down again, and they pick up where they left off with Sera professing her love for him. Of course, fate intervenes, and they have some major obstacles to overcome. Will they be able to overcome their two very different backgrounds to find their own HEA?		This book has to be one of the most sensual reads I have read. Both of these writers have a talent in engaging the senses which draws the reader deeper into the story. They use such lines like these.		He could still taste her on his tongue, could smell her exotic scent mingling with the chocolate.		Inching closer she leaned in, savoring his voice as he spoke. It was like soft, warm velvet rubbing across her skin.		Her lids slid closed as she inhaled his scent. Oh Heavens, he smelled raw and wild and intoxicating. Like thunderstorms and forest fires and the finest ambrosia.		And I don't think I will ever look at candy and chocolate the same way again after their hot session in the kitchen. WOW!!!!		There wasn't one thing I disliked about the characters. Sera is one unique angel. There is a sweet innocence to her, but yet she does have this naughty side that Cole is an expert at bringing out. Cole is one hot domineering demon. All he has to do is look at Sera, and she is putty in his hands, and he is excellent with those hands! As readers will see, he may be a demon, but he certainly has a human mans heart. They seem to bring out the best in each other, and they are a couple you are really rooting for. You want them to end up together even though they are from two very different worlds and have so much to overcome to find happiness. I will say it again. The sex scenes are UNBELIEVABLY HOT!!!		Borrowing one of Seras quotes, Sweet stars above, this one fantastic, steamy, sensual book. I do have the sequel already on my Kindle. As I finish this review, I will be headed back into the sensual world of Sera and Cole to see where the two lovers are headed next. If you are in the mood for a sexy love story with great characters, I would highly recommend this one.
0,Each couple had to learn to wait upon the Lord and always, His timing is best. Patience is a virtue that each of us must learn in life.
0,Investing never looked easier! i love and enjoy reading books about planning out lives and getting tips that will help you out plan a better future. The book itself was written very well and i think, organized perfectly.
0,Cute and Christmasy. A nice quick read with the happy ending I crave. Yay.
0,I quite enjoyed this time travel adventure.  It was not a poor copy of "Outlander".  The story is quite unique. It combines Norse and American Indian cultures, with what is referred to as Talents.  The characters all have a particular talent, it may be tracking, finding, oratory or almost any useful skill.  The main character even develops a unique talent once she arrives in what is to be her new home.  Of course, she falls in love with a seemingly unavailable man who cannot resist her.	The characters are well developed, the plot is quite twisty as the adventure moves on.  A good read.  I am looking forward to the next installment.
0,Dalton and Rose have a friendship that you can tell is something more than a friendship. I got lost in this short story so fast that I can't wait to start the next one.
0,Having already read Souls of the Never, I was interested in this short prequel and it definitely didn't disappoint. I'd liken it to Tolkien's The Silmarillion, or at least a part of it, as it succinctly details the ancient history leading up to the main storyline. And yes, it follows the rise of evil.		Well worth a read, though probably best to read it before Souls of the Never, so the ancient history of the Never is clear in your mind as you head into the next book.
0,Cam is on a mission to rescue, Miriam, a nurse volunteering in an earthquake-ravaged area of Mexico. She has been kidnapped by a Sinaloa cartel to help with its wounded. Cam, a giant among men, goes undercover, finds and rescues Miriam.  They begin the harrowing journey to their rescue point and Miriam proves herself to be strong and fearless as they brave the elements and elude the cartel members hunting them. But coming back to the US is not the end of danger. Miriam is targeted again, kidnapped, and an attempt is made to take her back into captivity in Mexico. Cam and Miriam fell in love during the rescue and he's not about to lose her now.  He and his Saints teammates once again set out to rescue Miriam. And there is a HEA in store for these two.		This is a story about the abuse of power, the perfidy of those in positions of trust, and the power of love and family. Another action-packed, fast-moving thriller in the Saints franchise that will keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.
0,This is another story about the girls from Alma Venus School. This was a wonderful action and suspense story that keep me on the edge of my seat. The Alpha of the Dragon clans has been asleep for over 700 years and Eric does not feel a need to stay awake. When Viggo gets in his mind to get his Alpha Eric to stay awake he buys Delyse as a bride. Over the months that they are waiting for the right time that Eric will awake for under 11 minutes. Viggo is slowly come to have some hard feeling for Delyse. Eric has lost his love before and has hard his heart to not make the same mistake again, will Delyse be able to change his mind? What is Delyse to do when she has to choose between the Alpha and Beta? Highly recommend this book and others that are in the series.
0,High in the Sierra Nevada Mountains forty-eight mostly reluctant adolescents attend a summer camp on sexual responsibility.  All goes well, until the adults disappear into a toxic fog, never to return.  The girls and boys are left, bewildered, without guidance or protection.  What will happen to them?  In a fight for survival, will they become savages, like the boys in Lord of Flies?  Or will they develop a community, like the wild rabbits in Watership Down?		In this unique story, Kathy gives an eye-witness account, slanted toward what interests her most, carpentry and human relationships, skimping on subjects she finds less compelling, such as nature and animals.  Details of her interest run deep, to being instructive.  And we are awed by her realistic portrayal of relationships.  Through Kathy, the author pulls us into the multitude of personalities and adventures as the youngsters learn to handle dangers both inside and outside the camp.  The kids grow up fast.		The story is so well written, one can forgive the several typos.  The story hooks us from the beginning and pulls us deeper with the telling.  I choked up over the funeral of a slain member.  I teared up when a girl told of her rape by lawless men outside the camp.  The characters are many, but somehow we keep them straight, and we care enough about them that we find even the mundane growth of community to be fascinating, just as we are mesmerized by the growth of a child into adulthood.  If you like coming of age and wilderness survival stories, you will find this book hard to put down.  I read past my bedtime.
0,I loved Sam and Ava in the first book of the series and I had a feeling that the next book was going to be for them. I was excited to read it. I love friends to lovers stories, although they are also very nerve wracking. Im always nervous for them, even though I know in the end theyll end up together. Changing the dynamics of any relationship is risky and scary, especially one like what Ava and Sam had. I loved seeing how their friendship progressed and where it started. Sams childhood was so sad, but I loved that he found a family with the Meyers.		I don't know how Ava lasted as long as she did as just Sams friend. Watching him hook-up with woman after woman. Having him come hang out with her after he sent his latest conquest home. All while she was in love with him. I don't know if I could do it.		The chemistry between Sam and Ava was evident in Truth or Dare and it was scorching hot in Touch & Go. I absolutely loved them together, but I also admired both of them on their own. I found myself so engrossed in their story that I did peep out a few tears here and there, both sad and happy ones. My heart broke for them both, but then soared for them as well.		This was such a great book and solidified this as a must read series. Maggie and Tyler made appearances as did Avas brother Ford and annoying, but hilarious cousin Tony. This group is a lot of fun and I really enjoyed every minute of this book. I cannot wait to read Fords story next.		Arc provided by the publisher via Netgalley for an honest review
0,I loved Kelly's chameleon...and that's the reason I picked this book.	the beginning was great...loved the sexual tension and the main character...	but frankly I needed more...i wasn't too happy with the ending either..
0,This book helped me a lot in so many ways! It actually made me see life on the brighter side. I was actually giving up on life due to problems and daily stress. someone recommend me to read a book about positive thinking because it is where I lack in. In fact I do not even know how to take control over what I think and how I look at things. Many thanks to Hanif Raah, if only you know how many people you help with your book. I agree with most of the reviews. really a good guide to learn to think positively at all times.
0,So many times, I grab photos with my phone. But there are those occasions when I want to take a little more care and actually use my digital camera. The fifty hints in this book are geared to both newbies and experienced photographers. The book will assist you in taking good quality digital photos.  Some of the tips in Adams' book I was aware of, but some of them were a really helpful surprise. This book is an easy read and well worth it!
0,This short story was rather sweet and a bit steamy.		The heroine is not some young girl just out of the school room. She had a season but definitely didn't take.  She has money and no need to marry, and she looks after the family estate while her father is away.		One of her interests is ghost hunting.  The neighboring estate is in disrepair as the lord and his first born son had run through the money but both of them have died. The second son, the spare, had been in the military but now came home to take up the reins.  The heroine sneaks up to the battlements to look for the ghost that is reputed to inhabit the place.		She hears footsteps and hides but the appearance of the ghost causes her to gasp and give herself away.  She attempts to get away but is caught by the hero, and despite her being clad in men's clothing he discovers the trespasser to be female.  The interaction between them is definitely not proper.  In order to protect herself she refuses to give her name.		The heroine doesn't consider herself to be attractive -- too tall, too gloriously healthy -- not petite and delicate.  She figures he will forget about their meeting.  The hero finds her attractive and is determined to find out who she is, which he easily does.		The story moves along quickly capturing the pair falling in love.		Some of the phrases used didn't strike me as being of the period, but it was a good story.
0,Very entertaining & well written.  I recommend this book and others by C . G. Powell
0,This is another great Lucy Guardino story! The author tried something new with the Now and Then storyline. It takes a couple chapters to get used to it and by then you can't put it down. It is a fast page turner that is another CJ Lyons must read. One of my must read authors!
0,Hmm....this book was definitely one of a kid.		Short enough to read in one sitting, it brings out enough depth of the characters, a twist in the tale till the very end.		But of course, the HEA does happen, ultimately.		What I couldn't completely take was that of Frank's character. I wish it had been different, and thats why I had to take out a star.
0,There's really not much more to say about this one other than its a sweet and hot little novella. This is the first book I've read by this author and it definitely will not be the last. I enjoyed the writing style, the heat and the story. Hopefully there will be more of these two!
0,While trying to get to a frozen pipe and thaw it out they find a dead body--This is well written and has quite a bit of humor. I recommend it highly.
0,The characters are wonderful.  The search for well known artifacts adds extra interest to the story.  I have the next book ready to read.
0,It rivals twilight, it's even more exciting. The characters make you love them, hate them, feel sorry for them just like a good story should. Good job
0,I knew this was a short story and it definitely was over before I was ready.  I like this series.
0,This was a short sizzling romance story with lots of heat, especially between the two lovers.	This was a fun storyline.
0,I liked this book. Action. Hot sex. Sweet affection. The characters were fantastic. The story was enthralling. The conclusion was great. A happy ending and justice added together was fantastic. Shane
0,Rebecca Jameson delivered twins shortly after her husband Frank died. She was weak and could not feed or take care of both children, the boy was looking weight because she did not have enough milk for both children. Her friend talked her into giving the boy up for adoption and to tell them at the orphanage his name is to be Frank. Shoemaker the little girl Lottie and she was very fussy like she knew her brother was gone, and tore Rebecca's heart out to give her son away. She prayed for a couple to give him a good home and love. He ended up being adopted by Cliff and Maria Daniels. This is a very touching, loving beautiful story for me it showed how the Grace and miracles of God can happen and they often do. I am a witness to that.
0,This story is a good short story about a female who thinks she has lost the love of her life when he saved her life. Then she takes his body and makes him CYBORG never knowing what she really set in motion. It is simply a good afternoon read.
0,I have read most of Patti's books to date and think she is a purely gifted writer!! I was given a free copy of Freak show for my honest review and here it is- I was so enthralled with the storyline that my house is falling apart and my family are starving!!- only kidding- I loved this storyline and cannot wait to read the rest of the series- I love the English language(despite living in Ireland!!) and could find no fault with grammar, descriptions etc!! For lovers of paranormal stories this is a must read- I am looking forward to seeing the development of Ray, Kinsey and Gerri!!!
0,I enjoyed this wonderful read so much and laugh. It caught me off guard. I am still wondering about a lot of the characters, but a good book will do that, I guess. What a wonderful series. I enjoyed them all. I couldn't choose a favorite, because all of the books are equally well thought out and written. Bravo!

0,Hollywood aint so Glam		The Redhead series by Alice Clayton		Holy Crapola. Finally Finally finished ALL 3 REDHEAD Books in like four days. I absolutely could not put them down. I literally could not go to sleep. I stopped at critical parts and my friggin mind was racing. WOW Just WoW talk about an emotional roller coaster sheesh. I'm such an emotional reader I laughed, I cried, I laughed some more and I cried, and cried and cried. I hated and I loved and the end OMG the end. At least Ill be able to sleep tonight.  The following review is based on all three books together since I read them non stop.		The Unidentified Redhead is Book #1 in this series and shows the start of a budding relationship between Grace Sheridan and Jack Hamilton who is an up and coming Hot Hot actor landing the lead in a major movie Time.  Graces best friend is Jacks manager and knows her business and knows how to promote her clients to the extreme. When the unexpected happens between Grace and Jack worlds start to come crumbling down.  Graces insecurities mount and she continues to push them down into her little box.  With Jack a hot commodity he needs to appear single and footloose and fancy free.  But falling hard for Grace is making this very difficult.  Grace 9 years older also loving her Brit is having a hard time with the age difference and image. Grace being mentioned as The Unidentified Redhead is being criticized up one side to the other and she tries very hard to push it down.  Jack on the otherhand could care less. He loves his redhead. By the time we get to The Redhead Revealed and all the restrictions put on Jack and Grace and all the rumors flying and Grace landing a dream job, slowly but surely Graces little box starts to crack apart and she has a total meltdown and Jacks premier of his movie.  Things don't go so well and I so lost it here.  I had my own little meltdown.  I so cried.  The love Jack has for Grace is right there you can see it and feel it down to your toes.  But Grace and her second guesses oh well you see where this is going.  Then we have The Redhead Plays her hand.  Wow talk about role reversals.  Jack is a huge success and at first he thinks hes able to handle.  But the paparazzi and not being able to be in public with the love of his life is getting to him.  When he lands another big role with a Hollywood bad boy shunned by the industry because of his actions, things go bad fast.  The bad boy Adam decides hooking up with Jack will help his own career and he wreaks havoc on Jack. This book was emotionally draining for me.  The adrenaline rushes, the heart pounding just everything had me reeling. After an incident with Jack putting him into the hospital Grace is right there by his side.  FINALLY he tells her they need to talk.  FINALLY.  When the two of them are offered jobs as presenters at the Emmys things get a little tense, especially with all the recent bad publicity with Jack.  BUT on the Red Carpet (spoiler) Grace finally has the courage to step up to the plate and ignore her best friend and manager when she sees the media drilling Jack on the carpet.  She walks right up to him grabs his arm, then his hands and they start walking the carpet together amongst tremendous cheering and screams and as the stop to pose for pictures he grabs her close to him showing the world they are a couple and they just don't care what others think. The ending to this book was soooooo rewarding, sweet and heartfelt I finally let out a breath I hadnt know I was holding.  Wow		 LMAO I really really loved Alice Claytons The Redhead what can I say Not too many reads affected me like these books did. If you haven't read them you need too! But a piece of advice, if you work don't start these reads until the weekend.  Trust me youll end up with sleepless nights.
0,Loved it just as much as the first.  Could not wait to get back to Tristen and Kyla!! DeeDee prince does an amazing job of keeping the action, and the passion going. I am so in love with this couple want them to make it work so badly and who would think you wanted a Vamp to win?  Another cliffhanger.  Excited to read the 3rd but hopefully not last in this series.
0,I received an ARC for an honest and fair review		A great collection of steamy stories!!!
0,Wonderful novelette.  Introduction and background on Alex.
0,Loved this book.  I love all of Dr. Seuss' books.  Gives some info about Dr. Seuss that I did not know.
0,I really enjoyed reading this story. The connection between Melly and Hart was tangible. He was later cold hearted but understandably so and she was so kind and patient - just as she wished she had been 11 years before. Lovely story.
0,True loves comes to those who want love.  Clohe Hart weaves a really enjoyable short story and brings back other favorite characters who believe in love conquering any circumstance!
0,Not what you think information wise but a good primer.
0,Story was detailed well and informative. No boring or dragging parts to fill spaces. Well written, thumbs up to the writer.
0,"The Omni Diet Plan: High Protein Low Carb Weight Loss to Optimum Health" encourages eating well and making beneficial lifestyle changes, with an ultimate goal of long-term long-lasting health and wellness; all packed into a sensible, simple to understand book.		This book contains allot of information, but is well organized and easy to read. Lifestyle game-plan, popular myth-busting, and plain and simple diet that MAKES SENSE! What more can you ask?!		If you are tired of jumping from one "normal diet" to another, and want an easy diet that is complete and just makes sense, I highly recommend giving this book a read! Great job!
0,Wow really liked this cant wait to see happens next. Rachel is a great women, great voice, looking to make it in the music business, she meets Brooks and Alex who are record label executives, but she doesn't know they are, they both want her sexually and professionally, so they don't tell her who they really are because there afraid that she will think she will have to sleep with them to get signed, which is wrong, so what happens when lies catch you cant wait to find out
0,I love the relationship between Ezra and Alexis. The ups and downs they are going through. I am rooting for them. They were truly put together by God. Love it.
0,I'm always worried when I read a YA books from a male POV. I'm always tense that the author will portray them as a "walking stiff".	Sometimes authors get it wrong and sometimes they do it right, the last being the case of our main character, Ryan.	Ryan was portrayed beautifully in Wendy Higgins's Flirting with Maybe. The hormones are definitely there, but there are so much more about him and I bet that he'll will make you swoon over and over again.		I can't wait to see what lies ahead for Wendy Higgins, she's such a talent writer and it's already on my auto-buy list
0,Definitely not a romance story. It was a very interesting story, it got my attention very fast and it was hard, for me, to stop reading it.  The main character, Gideon, was nice, it was good to see how he react to all the things that were going on and mostly to uncertainty. I was most attracted to one of the anthagonists, Drago, but i felt like his character was underdeveloped, i think there was so much potential on him, he was very intriguing, i really loved him but i wish there was more to know of him.	The story had some interesting twists that made it unpredictable and that was so good. I didn't know what to expect and that always make a good read.	The story is full of violence, it has hardly romance on it. It has a content advisory that is important to be read, because i think it might not be a good read for everyone, but i enjoy it very much.	In spite of the content advisory i'd pushed myself to read it becuase i'd read other books of the author and i liked them. I don't read books about shifters, that is definitely a no for me. But i give it a try to this one and it work for me, i realy enjoy it and i will be soor reading Slash Op.
0,I received this book from the publisher for an honest review. I have always enjoyed Mail-Order Bride stories. I was intrigued by the book blurb and could not wait to read this one. I was not disappointed, even though it is a very short novella. That is probably my only complaint. It just was not long enough! I wanted more. Nonetheless, it is a sweet love story filled with a lot of heart and plenty of humor.		I loved Daniels reaction when he finds out that Emily has taken his mail-order brides place. I could just see him stomping around, ready to shoot off his gun, madder than a rattle snake. Ms. Downing had me right there as if I were Emily watching him come unglued swearing a blue streak. I imagined him throwing his hat down and stomping on it, even though she did not describe that. I could picture Emily gathering up her courage and telling him when he asked her what the hell she expected now, Marry you, of course.		Emily is wondering what she has gotten herself into. Daniel is dirty, and needs a shave, plus he is mean tempered. Not the best first impression to say the least. However, after he calms down, he treats Emily with the utmost respect and courtesy, showing her the honorable man he really is. This convinces her that Daniel is the man for her.		Daniel quickly finds out he cares for Emily, but since he feels committed to Ethel, the woman he originally sent for, he insists on sending her back, even if he has to sell some of his livestock to do it.	Soon, Emilys enticing ways has him rethinking his decision, and long before he can come up with the funds to send her back east, he realizes he is in love with her.		Before Daniel has a chance to tell Emily of his change of heart, her brother shows up while he is gone on an errand and tells her a pack of lies. Emily leaves with her brother broken-hearted, convinced Daniel still loves Ethel.		When Daniel goes after her, can he convince her he has fallen in love with her and wants her to be his wife, or will Emily allow her conniving brother to keep them apart?		I thoroughly enjoyed this delightful story from the first page to the last word and read it in one sitting, flipping the pages on my Kindle as fast as possible. While it is quite short, it has great character development and a well thought out plot. The author brings to life the vivid landscape of the Rocky Mountains and the glorious skies above. Her historical detail for the time period is detailed, and it is obvious she did her research. If you like western historical romances with lots of heart, then this is one that you will definitely want to read. Happy reading!
0,Love it!!
0,The only two complaints about this book are, that the story moved way to fast,and the main part turned into a dream.  But a good thing to know is that she is promised at the end, that all of her sexual fantasies will be fulfilled.  We just won't be there, because that's where the book ends.  A very good book that has a lot of explicit descriptions of the sexual act.  I just wish there was more.
0,i have to say this was one of the funniest shifter books I have read in a while. Don't get me wrong there is heat in this book of course but Claire Ryann has added humor in this one.	Rod Nolan is a grizzly bear shifter and he happens to be the chief Forrest Ranger as well. Great way hide in plain view right? Except it doesn't exactly happen like it should when he runs into Park Ranger human Sara McAllister. This is a short read but OMG it is oh so worth every single word. I was gifted this for my honest review.
0,Enjoyed reading the book. Good storyline to go with all the hot sex. The sparks flew when Camp and Jenny fought which was often.
0,I do like this book. This is a very good writer. You got to understand that it is boy on boy book. So if you are not in to this or a open mind do not read.
0,I was worried about the birthday gift for my girlfriend. I am just trying to find out some new and especial for her and finally have found this book as a best gift. There has some amazing hairstyle tips & tricks with fantastic images. I am happy to give her this book and she much happier after finding it. Would you please give me next copy?

0,One of my many favorites and highly recommended.
0,Coming Home	By Graylin Fox	Reviewed by Jaime Kurp		The only thing about this story is that it wasn't long enough. The author gives you enough to get you wrapped in the story and then leaves you hanging. Which is a good technique to use to keep the reader coming back for more. This is a wonderful story about Lyn learning who she is after she has lost so much. She doesnt think she can go on without them, but finds out that once she came home everything will be okay.
0,Sexy strong leading man and independent and talented female with lots of chemistry... my kind of book. This series delivers again !! Can't wait to finish the story.
0,This book throws J.D. into the fire, or rather the toddlers. As usual there is snark, fortune cookies, and Bible Study. This is a contuination of the story of the Fletcher-Reid clan and shows the ups,downs, and overall craziness of a relationship.
0,Good action adventure. Somewhat different from the usual western, but I really enjoyed it. It was a quick fun read
0,This is the first book in the Brides of Holland Springs series & if this is any indication this series will be just as good as all of Marquita Valentines other series.		This book is about Noah Sawyer & Kate Von Lichtenstein. If youve read the Holland Springs series you will probably remember them. They met several years ago at another Holland Springs wedding & each made an impression on the other. When they meet at the reception of Sebastian Romanov & Daisy Barnes they are both at a point in their lives when they could use some help. This is the story of how two people from completely different worlds can come together &, if they work at it, be the answer to one anothers prayers.		I cant wait to read more from this series! It looks like Marquita Valentine has another hit series on her hands!!!
0,The title snagged me but the story kept me. Its a very busy yet fascinating book that brings together many elements of what makes a tale entertaining. Action, suspense, heroic actions and two diverse people coming together to fall in love amidst trying times are just some of the highlights that I enjoyed.		Seamus and Maysa are two vastly different kinds of people, literally. Yet, they have a lot in common, not just that they are destined mates but because of the fields they worked in. It made sense and in came in handy when the plot crisis hit.		I believe this book is smack dab in the middle of a series yet I didn't feel lost. In fact, I thought the way the author caught me up to speed was clever. It almost came across like an info dump but in essence it was getting Maysa up to speed and her reaction and mine were the same, Wow! What was different is that it made Maysa feel guilty for adding to the packs challenges, while I was left with the feeling I should really read the back stories. They sounded exciting!		I enjoyed meeting all the people that were in Seamus world and found them pleasing and personable. I liked the feeling of support, camaraderie, caring and love that seemed to abound on various levels. These were people that were survivors, and they had a lot of love to give others. That was more than apparent when the group pulled together to perform a daring rescue. What they found was horrible, tragic and what amounts to a declaration of war. I like how everything was handled but there certainly were a lot of people to keep track of.		The point of view was mainly between the main protagonists, Seamus and Maysa. It was their growing relationship that was the focus of the story but there were a few sub-plots in there too. This book was better than a soap opera because I got closure on quite a few of them. There was even a short bit from Maxs POV, but I think that was a possible lead in to a future story. Sure sounded like it would be interesting.		The dialogue fit the characters, the writing was perfect and the villain was wonderfully evil and unrepentant. If hes a symptom of the greater evil, then this series has the capacity to turn dark really fast. I hope that doesnt happen because I found this story well balanced with a focus more on love than hate, and I prefer that.		When the hero and heroine finally are able to consummate their love, it was well done. Just enough description to show how well matched they were and how hot their passion burned. I enjoyed all that biting.		The title of The Vampires Bat may sound silly and comedic but its not. This novella takes the romance very seriously. The plot is meaty and the story is fascinating. This is a great choice for paranormal romantic suspense readers who like their books with a sexy edge.		originally posted at long and short reviews
0,I received this book in exchange for an honest review.  This is my first book by Kat Cantrell and I'm so glad to have found her! I love stories about Navy Seals and ex Navy Seals and this one didn't disappoint. I loved Dex and Emma and their story of love and healing. This was a fun, romantic, sexy read and I was drawn in from beginning to end. I can't wait for the next book in the series.
0,My original review can be found at Sizzling Hot YA Books		Oh, boy did I REALLY love this book. Why? Well, for one, it didn't take the traditional new adult route and I am so glad for that. Having never gone away to college myself, I often times find myself skimming those sorts of scenes in this genre. But ya know what? I didn't have to in Fall With Me. Sure, both the hero and heroine were graduates and all, but this book centers around so much more than just the everyday college life.		This is Jenna and Suttons story. Two people whove always harbored some sort of crush on one another, but there really was never a good moment for them as a real couple. For one, Sutton is older, not to forget mentioning the brother to Jennas best friend. But the whole bestie thing falls through when Suttons sister has a fling with Jennas fiance (if thats what he ever really was.) Alas, now Jennas heartbroken, moved back home, and working for her father. Yet the one thing she cant really complain about, is working alongside Sutton.		Together, these to feisty, lovable characters devise a plan to end the relationship between Suttons sister and Jennas ex. But that plan also includes a fake relationship between the two of them. But scheming with the one person you cant stop thinking dirty thoughts about kind of brings about another set of problems..		Fall With Me was un put downable. A story that didn't let me go until I hit that very last page. Predictable? Maybe a tadbut I appreciated ever last inch of that predictability. Truly, Ms. Particka has an amazing way with words. Her ability to differentiate both the hero and heroes voice was really well done. And that is rare for me to find, especially when the story is told in 1st person with multiple povs.		An endearing and real heroine who, yeah, wasn't on her best best decision making behavior the entire novel. But to me, I could relate to Jenna more because of that. A girl who was a little broken, a little confused, and fresh out of college, I really appreciated the way her part of the story was told. Sutton, on the other hand Wowzers. Hell definitely be sitting pretty on my book boyfriend list for a while. Sweet, loving, and a guy who loves hard. I enjoyed himso much I cant even put it into words.		Overall, if you're looking for something a little different in the new adult genre, then I highly recommend Fall With Me. Its an easy read, with a little drama, but nothing that will draw you out of the love that is Jenna and Sutton. So do me a favor and pick this one up.		I dare you not  to love it as much as me.
0,Now this is a good shifter book. A light read but well written with sexy shifters. I look forward to the next in the series!
0,This book takes the worry out of teaching English. Mrs. Binz discusses grading, writing course descriptions, how to credit, and includes suggestions for assisting the unique learner. As with her other books, this is a quick read and takes the stress out of seemingly complex topic and boils it down to the bare essentials.
0,Lovely story
0,TRACKS of Her Tears is the first novella of two. An interesting mystery, a little romance and a caring family.
0,This is a quick and fun read. It is a series so if you are not into series then you will want to pass. I happen to like series. And if that series is really good,I love being able to continue on with the reading.	 What I liked best about this story was how it got better as it along. The ending was awesome,makes you want to go get the next book right now.
0,Even through her grief, Freya has to carry on selling mistletoe from the family farm. Sam and Stephen, owners of nearby Henderson farm, don't make it easy on her, as they want to buy her property in the middle of the Christmas season!		Davies writes a magical story, where Freya lets the wonder of the season speak to her through a mystery visitor. When Freya opens up her heart, she finds her happily ever after - and so does one of the Hendersons.		I liked that this novella was a light read but had a deep message. Davies reminds us that we can find happiness and love despite grieving a loved one.

0,Wow - I can't believe how many recipes I have bookmarked in here and I am only half-way through!  Breakfast pizza, pesto chicken pasta, cashew popcorn.  Yummy!  Thanks!
0,A high rating for the story. Very well written, excellent characters. The story builds on each of the characters, and the story line builds on to the next story.
0,ARC provided by author for honest review.		 Jones had me intrigued from the very first time we met him. He's a player with layers. Learning who Spencer Jones really is was a fantastic story. He's such a misunderstood charmer. His perfect match was our kick ass chick April. She was his key to growing up and learning to live his life how he wanted to and to go after what he truly wanted. They had so fire and passion between them it was intoxicating. A fantastic mix of laughs angst passion and resolution. I did get a little annoyed with Aprils torture of Spencer but it helped him grow. Absolutely love little glimpses of Eevi and Aiden thrown in as well and the introduction of Rocco. I'm seriously looking forward to more in the series.	If you loved spark and spike you will to love strike.
0,I simply loved this book. The author's style of writing has not changed much from her first series  and has a way of seizing you and pulling you into the story. I have waited a long time for the author for the author to continue the story and I am really glad see did. I great book in a great series.
0,Tempts  you to give it a try. Good information on healthy foods and good choices  for each season, will try.
0,I swear if the other Levas us hanging I will pull a Steven king on his or her but so gives a forth book
0,Great book
0,Loved this book.  Not too sexy but just enough.  I will definitely buy the other books.
0,I thought this was a unique story. I felt the pain of what they both had endured. Hayley more because we experienced her loss first hand. Aiden may be a part time idiot, but shoot he's so sweet he can get away with it. The author did a wonderful job of drawing the reader in.
0,This book was all kinds of wow! This was the first Katie Ashley book I have ever read and I have to say I was blown away. The whole premise of the story was amazing as well as the way it just melded together. I honestly could not put this book down.	My heart broke for Sophie as she goes through the motions to support herself and her family being a domme. The entrance of William knocked her to knees though and he became the rule breaker. These two together were like fireworks exploding when Sophie finally relented. William gave her everything she wanted and more. But when issues arise, it was earth shattering. What I loved is how these two, even though stubborn, fought for each other. Their love no matter the obstacles overcame everything in their way.	I thoroughly enjoyed this whole book as it flowed amazingly off the pages and the whole story meshed together. Though this book is about a domme and a sub, its not as kinky as it leads on. It's more than just that. It's about finding love in the most unexpected places with the most unexpected person. I seriously urge you to give this book a shot!		I received a copy for an honest review
0,Another good book by Rhonda Carver!  This is a hot cowboy who needs a second chance at finding his ability to love again.  He finds a strong cowgirl who is able to help him.  All the books in this series are great!!
0,This book was so good and kept me on the edge of my seat and way past when I should of went to bed. I loved the characters and the twists and turns really had me guessing and double guessing myself. I hated for the book to end but it ended so good!!!
0,When Courtney catches her boyfriend in the act, she storms out leaving the cheat behind. Driving like a maniac in a snowstorm, Courtneys car breaks down leaving her stuck.		Brain is off out and spots Courtneys car. He doesnt have time to deal with her but he also feels bad to drive off. He sorts out her car and drops her home.		The sexual tension is instant, you can feel it radiating from them, but Brain thinks Courtney is a stuck up princess and Courtney thinks Brain is a c**ky git. After leaving her purse in Brains car, he returns it to her and the heat gets turned up a notch.	This was a fast paced, insta-love book. It was a smoking hot read and really does get to the point but between the hotness there is a good story being told! If you like full blown stories, this is not for you but I really enjoyed it!!
0,Really like the story and the ending.
0,What a thrilling exciting listen that keeps you on the edge of your seat. If you are looking for an audio that is fast moving, with action, suspense, mystery and romance you have come to the right place. This was so good I was so hooked from start to finish that I bought the first audio in this series and cant wait for the next one to come out.		I thought the narrator did a really great job with the characters. There are some places when she paused that she should not have.  A few places where she paused that maybe the next words should have been said before the pause. It did take me a little while to get use to her narration but once I did I was hooked. Her character voices are great both her male and female was given the correct amount of emotion to what they were going through.  There are no background noises, no volume change just a very clean steady audio that become a part of your mind. No repeating of words which is a big issue for me, if any breaks were taken I could not tell. I had no trouble knowing what character was talking or what they were feeling. The only problem I see is the narrator needs to work on when she pauses beside that it was an outstanding job. I would defiantly listen to more of her work. I thought she really bought the characters to life making it a very pleasant listen.		There are many twists and turns, you get to see both side of the story which really adds to the plot. There are a few heart stopping moments that you are unsure which way the author will take the story. I honestly didn't not care for Jakes boss and he outlook on Jakes secret, he really started out as a very nice man but really turned into well an a** very fast. He will lose a lot of good men if he doesnt clean up his act. I loved Jake he really is a man of honor, his father at first is a little hard to take but he grows on you. Adam was a dream I loved how protective he was of Jenny. The buildup of the romance was a delight, I really enjoyed how Adam dealt with it. There are lots of humor that will make you smile just as many places where you catch your breath waiting to see the outcome. It is a highly entertaining listen that pulls the reader in holding you on the edge. The romance is wonderful I just loved how they loved each other from afar for so long with neither knowing how the other felt. I liked how it all came together.  The obsessed is crazy lord the things this man thinks of will just turn your stomach. He is totally nuts wanting the women who he believes is his true love and the revenge he thinks is his due for the justice he thinks he deserves.  You just have to love a psycho, that is as long as it is in a story and not real life.		Bottom line this is a great story from start to finish that holds the listener spellbound waiting for the nut case to come out. There is a fine line between right and wrong but if you are like me when it comes to the people you love trying to keep them safe you will cross that line every time.  I can see this series going in a lot of different direction all with a great outcome as some leave the law enforcement getting away from the ties of the law when the law doesnt work. I really cant wait to see what the author will do with the next book. I really wish it was out now. I honestly did not want the story to end. It isn't a cliffhanger but does leave a few loose ends where the next book will take off.
0,This book is good. In this book we meet Katlyn a girl who has been stuck under the protective hold of her parents her whole life. She decides she wants and adventure so she does her research and over and over again people keep telling her if you want adventure the Wilted Petal is place to go. All Katlyn wanted was a hot encounter with two hot studs what she got was a whole lot more. Brendan and Chase were just looking for a good time away from home themselves but when they lay eyes on Katlyn they know they shouldn't but they just can't help but be drawn to her and can't stand any others to touch her. This story runs pretty quickly but it will keep your attention from the beginning to the very end. I would recommend this book with a caution if you are looking for something real in depth this is not the book for you. If you are looking for a book you can read while out relaxing then look no further.
0,Great storyline and ending.  Can't wait til the other book comes out. Hopefully we find out who one between the two.
0,Creepy stalkers, murder, brawls and jealousy. What's not to love, as long as you havve these two sexy guys? If you just keep the faiith in Max, he bares why he's so prickly. And it's good for him to see Ethan's not only appreciated by himself.
0,I became familiar with Lynn Messinas writing when I read one of her chick-lit titles in the Red Dress Ink line. In addition to chick-lit, Ms. Messina also has young adult, fantasy and paranormal and historical romance in her repertoire. The Harlow Hoyden is a historical romance set in the regency period featuring Emma Harlow, a woman who lives by her own set of rules and refuses to bow down to the expectations of society. She enlists the assistance of The Duke of Trent to break up her twin sister Lavinias engagement to the odious Sir Waldo the Windbag. Her plan is simplehe will draw Lavinias attention away from her fianc in the hopes that she will develop feelings for The Duke and call off her engagement. Emma is convinced that Sir Waldo is a villain and cannot stand the idea of her beloved twin ruining her life. What happens next is a madcap adventure that has Emma breaking into Waldos home, dancing the waltz and chasing down traitorous spies, with The Duke of Trent either by her side or close on her heels.		I really enjoyed this story. Emma is a breath of fresh air and I liked her immensely. Shes daring and direct and refuses to let society or her family dictate to her how a proper lady should behave. She has been given the nickname The Harlow Hoyden because she walks a fine line between propriety and scandal and she could care less. She has no interest in marriage or making a suitable match and prefers to live her life as she sees fit. Whether she is stealing a prized orchid from The Dukes conservatory or proposing outlandish schemes to break up her sisters engagement, she does so with a gusto and headstrong determination that would make most people cringe in horror. There are a few moments in the book that made me wonder if Emmas actions are too rash, but quickly remembered that is why she earned her moniker.		I thought The Duke was an excellent character and the perfect match for Emma. This period in time usually depicts men being in charge and viewed as complete masters of the universe. I enjoyed seeing The Duke agreeing to help Emma thinking he would be able to deter her, not realizing who is really in charge. Emmas twin and her brother and his wife were also likeable characters. I am hoping that Lavinia will get her own story in the future.		Overall, fans of historical romance will enjoy this offering and if you are not a fan of historical romance, but enjoy a fun and adventurous story with strong characters and witty dialogue, where villains are vanquished and good triumphs over bad, give this one a try.		Disclaimer: I received a complimentary copy of The Harlow Hoyden by the author in exchange for an honest review.
0,It was a world where you can't trust anyone and you've got little to lose.  I wasn't disappointed with the story at all and liked the realism of the main character.
0,I love how Wendy was introduced to us in the Date series and now she has her own book in a new series. The legend of Blue Moon Bay says that if you get kissed under a blue moon your true love will last forever. Only Wendy left her life back in Sacramento and Max is leaving for Japan. She is convinced that her bad memories of her childhood home are what has kept her away from her brother and her girlfriends. Now her grandmother passed away and the will states that she and her brother must sell the Inn. Wendy knows real estate and decides that they need to do some renovations to the old Inn before selling it. Max has fallen hard for Wendy and decides to stay and help with the work. Wendy is trying to push him away because she feels that he will just leave her. Little does she know he has no intention of leaving without her. I love this book and will be reading more in this series.
0,I really enjoyed this book, the original premise was what attracted me to purchase and I was not disappointed- hope there is more to come especially with some of the secondary characters, perhaps a 'new' Change of Heart series .Mary Calmes is one of my favourite authors of this genre and rarely do I feel let down after reading one of her novels.
0,Loved it!  :) Loving this new author for me in my ever growing collection. Merryn Dexter did not disappoint me and look forward to reading more of her works now. :)		This story is about Silver Ellis, caught seeing something she shouldn't have that thrusts her into Witness Protection.  She's a teacher, trying to improve the lives of those that need it.  She witnesses a murder and is then put under the care of a pack enforcer - a big sexy wolf! :)		Kirk Matheson is looking forward to life slowing down now that the pack is settling down with its rebuilding. Preferring to keep to himself now when he is suddenly asked to look after Silver.		Both do heir best to keep some distance, but his wolf knows her as his mate. Silver is a little wary of the big guy and takes time to accept him as more than just her protector. She accepts his wolf easily.		When Silvers life is in danger, hers there to save her, or die trying.		Its a great story that flowed well. I cant wait to read more of Merryn Dexters works and this series. I was gifted a copy of this book for an open and honest review.
0,I enjoy Wiersby's commentary.  I'm currently studying the book of John in this series and it is quite enlightening.
0,I found this book to be a good read, I liked the two lead character's as well as the secondary one. Looking forward to the next book.
0,Interesting read a well put together storyline and plot; however book length a bit too short but I looking forward to reading the next installments in this new series

What all you need is have enough knowledge, using the fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) service to start your business. Follow seven steps put up in this helpful guide. It must be in your library.
0,I am so in love with Chase and Isabeau that I pray they soon figure out that they two are in love with each other. I am excited to see where this story goes and was saddened to learn that Delilah will be ending the series with book # 9 due out later in Sept 2012.		Chase and Isa are two characters that come alive in your mind as you read. Nothing is better in a book than having characters that you believe to be real and Delilah is great at doing just that.
0,In The Missing Mah Jong Player, by Iris Wynne, divorced Marilou is looking for love in online chat rooms. She has been very busy with her dates and other commitments, that she hasn't really had a lot of time for her mah jong group. So when she misses a day after confirming she would be there, Harriet (friend and fellow mah jong player) begins to grow worried. She goes to her house and discovers that Marilou is missing.  When the police make no headway into solving the crime and are giving up, Harriet decides to hire a private investigator, Steve Wade. Wade is an ex-policeman who at first doesnt want to take the case. After much arm twisting and free cupcakes from Harriets bakery, he complies. But Marilous disapperance raises a lot of hard questions. Was she killed? Did she willingly leave? Was one of the guys she was dating responsible for her disappereance? Or was the criminal someone much closer to her? Not only is Wade investigating a hard case, he also has the five remaining mah jong players intent on helping him discover the truth. From staging a speed dating dinner, to questioning family and friends; these ladies and Wade are hot on the trail.	 When you read the synopsis of the book it is very centered on Steve Wade and sounds like a modern Philip Marlow or Sam Spade type of detective fiction. I am not sure if the author changed her direction while writing, or is hoping for a Steve Wade series, but that is not the case. Instead of being solely focused on the private investigator the story is shown through the eyes of Wade, Harriet, Sarah (mah jong player and Wades new secretary), and Candy Kane (stripper turned private investigator).  I believe this actually improves the story as it transforms it into being more than just a mystery, but also how a loss affects people and what they do to deal with their grief. Everyones reactions to Marilous disapperance range across the board. You have some of her friends in denial, believing she just ran away; some who don't want to think on the issue and are intent on forgetting it as it is a matter for the police; Sarah who won't stop crying as Marilou was a mother figure to her, and Harriet who needs closure and answers so she hires a detective. Not only does this more personal approach make a stronger story, but it really helps you connect to the characters. This also causes you to really care for Marilou, as all these personal reactions make her into an actual person instead of a body or victim #1.	 Steve Wade was a great character as well. He was intelligent, imaginative, analytical, and able to solve the mystery after a series of time. I liked that it wasn't instantaneous but methodical, and that at times Steve would sometimes miss what was right in front of his face as he was too heavily concentrated on another aspect. He is also a perfect compliment to his surrounding characters. I hope that this will be turned into a series and that we may see more Steve Wade in the future.	 As for the mystery it was pretty compelling. We at first have the question of whether or not there is an actual crime or if Marilou just left of her own accord. Then when it is established as a murder we have a long list of motives and suspects; everyone from Marilous cousins, friends, men she was dating, to even her children. It progresses realistically and the only complaint I have was that the end seemed a bit rushed as they present the resolution.	 I thought this book is fantastic and the perfect addition to any mystery lovers bookcase or kindle. I give the story a five out five.
0,First of all, this book is definitely catered towards kids, so as long as you know that, there shouldn't be any surprises. The photos are really more for illustrative purposes rather than actual Mars photos. The facts provided are interesting and would definitely inspire conversation with you kids to talk about the planets. There were a few things mentioned about the planet that I wasn't aware of (either that or just didn't remember). From a size perspective, the book is a good length for bedtime reading with the kids. Not real in depth, but definitely is a good started book on the planet for the kids. Would recommend for the purposes described above		Disclaimer: This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.

0,This was a good read in sci-fi alien romance/mating. The women of Earth are finding more than just a new world waiting to be explored. This series give delicious romance with males out of this world and a new world to explore. What I liked most was that each male was not a carbon copy of the one before. The women were not all one stereotype of the petite beautiufl light hair spitefire. The subplot through them all did make resolution by the end of the final read. There were a few place where detail would have added much to the read.
0,This for sure was interesting. And I genuinely liked the struggle of the main character it seems her personal scares lead her life. Then to see that she was willing to admit she had them and work towards overcoming them instead of just sitting in them was great. The male lead seemed a little predictable at some points but I still loved his need to be his own man as well. All in all this was a good read.
0,lots of good stories, good reading
0,I picked this book out for 2 reasons.		Reason 1: It was free on Netgalley and I figured why the hell not.		Reason 2: The synopsis is something that I had actually never read about before. Probably, and I realized this around about chapter 2, because it is an absolutely terrible thing to do to a friend. Real friends do not act like that. If they pine after their best friend's boyfriend, they do not act on it. They do not try to get said boyfriend alone and trick him into loving you instead. Real friends are happy for their best friend's relationships. I don't care who saw who first, you cut that shit out.		And I was prepared to hate it just because of the friendship between Kayla and Raegan and the constant swooning over Talon. BUT I related way too much to Kayla that I couldn't find it in my heart to hate her even a little bit. I wanted her to see her ways and get better and just kiss Wesley already because I knew that's who she wanted anyways.		The plan Kayla and Wesley hatch is ridiculous. It's not something people actually do, and that's why I wanted to read it. It pissed me off much of the time. They were both selfish. Plain and simple. However, a few times throughout this book, they do realize how shitty they are being. Does that stop them though? Nope. They plan through until they indeed do break up their best friends relationships.		This book is prime example that there is no such thing as "just friends" between men and women. There are always feelings somewhere beneath the surface. They may never come up for air, but they are definitely alive.		Kayla's obsession with Talon borderlines insanity. Swear to god, every two paragraphs she was talking about how sexy Talon was in his football jersey. How hot Talon was with his black hair. How good he looked while making out with his girlfriend. And the way he was described, I just didn't see it. He was kind of boring actually and I preferred, of course, funny musician Wesley.		Wesley was hilarious! I have NEVER literally laughed out loud while reading, and then think about it at a later time and smile like a weirdo. He was sweet and says the sexiest, cutest things! What more could a girl ask for?		The banter between Kayla and Wesley was the best damn thing about Switched. They were absolutely adorable and it's the kind of relationship every girl wants. You will just have to read this book to see all the clever things they come up with. It's highly entertaining.		The ending was perfect. I love how it wrapped up. I loved the surprise from Reagan and Talon. I. Loved. It. All.		If you're looking for something light and fresh to get lost in on a rainy weekend, Switched is where it's at.
0,Good fast read.
0,OPERATION WHITE CHRISTMAS by Nicki Edwards was a fun, fast read that I could not put down.		The story is this book was very well written and well developed and the plot was very fast paced and kept my heart beating just a little bit faster with the hope of true love still existing.  The characters in this book are quite simply, wonderful, if I had to use one word.  Hollie and Jim, two regular people who, for Hollie is in the wrong place and for Jim who is in the right place at the right time and hapen upon one another in the middle of a Canadian snow storm.		Hollie, who has found out that her fiance has been cheating on her, decides that she is going to go on the honeymoon anyway and fulfill her dream to have a white Christmas.  Arriving in Canada to find out that her cheating ex has cancelled the hotel reservation, she has no where to stay, one of the hotel clerks sends her to a bed and breakfast.  Hollie never makes it to the bed and breakfast, in the middle of the snow storm she meets a llama in the middle of the road, and when Jim her owner comes to resuce the llama, he also resuces Hollie.  Hollie is just what Jim needed to find love again, having lost the love of his life to cancer.  This book follows Hollie and Jim as then spend Christmas and New Years Eve together, Jim giving Hollie the Canadian experience of a lifetime and Hollie giving Jim love again. Will  both Hollie and Jim be able to admit that they have fallen for each other, or will Hollie head home to Austrillia by herself.		OPERATION WHITE CHRISTMAS by Nicki Edwards will retore your faith in true love at first site, it was a quick read and will help get the holiday spirit it you come alive as the holidays are approaching.  I would give OPERATION WHITE CHRISTMAS 4/5 stars.		Review on behalf of Once Upon and Alpha.
0,great addition to series
0,I became breathless when I got to Alex's kidnapping, thinking this just couldn't be the end, or wondering if he were hurt so bad that his future with Jennifer might be touch and go. But, all is well. My next favorite spot happened at the party when Jennifer bitch slapped that  jealous,spiteful woman . Filled with surprises this series continues to thrill me.
0,This is a story of two people both going through major changes in their lives while finding friendship and love with one another. I love this because unlike a lot of books coming out now there wasn't instant love between the main characters. Instant attraction yes but their love happened slow and steady.	I loved reading about Will and his struggle. I think his behavior was pretty true to how most men would react in the same situation. Leah' s response was perfect.	I thoroughly enjoyed this book.y
0,Enjoyable but didn't hold my interest enough to buy the next installment.
0,I first came across this book from a book blog that I follow.  That led me to Logan Patrick's website.  I put in my information to get future information on the book.  I was surprise to find the first three chapters emailed to me.  I read them and I was hooked.  Yesterday, I got an email saying the book was live at Amazon.  I squealed and bought the book.  My kids looked at me like I was crazy.  I got busy reading.		This book should come with a warning.  All track of time will be lost while reading.  I almost forgot about making dinner last night.  Sleep, forget about it.  Thank god for Xbox and Minecraft so I have time to finish it.		The characters are incredible.  I love Aria.  She is so down to earth, funny, intelligent, witty, and strong.  Shadow is just that.  A beautiful mystery with skeletons in the closet.  Aria and Shadow start off against each other but you find they have similar souls.  Abraham is tender hearted.  Lincoln is funny.  Calisto is bigger than life.		The story is well paced.  I was always feeling something.  Whether it was laugh aloud during the interactions between Bria and Aria, or having my heart break for Aria and Shadow over their similar loss, I would always feel how they felt. I'm trying to be vague so I don't give anything away.  You will feel a whole range of emotions when you read this.		As far as the story line, forget about trying to guess what is going to happen next.  I am very good about figuring out the twists and turns in books, tv, and movies.  I couldn't figure out anything.  Just when I thought I had it, something would happen that change everything I thought.  The ending.. Oh. My. God.		Logan Patrick said this was his first attempt at writing from the female perspective.  He did an awesome job.  He must have gotten some female advice for a few of the sex scenes:)  I will say this book is a little violent.  But I'm not sensitive to those thing.		I am hooked.  I can't wait for the next one.  Please hurry Mr. Patrick.  I can't wait to see where Aria and Shadow will go next.		Buy this book.  I won't disappoint.  Off to make Christmas cookies with Thing 1 & 2.
0,Fast moving and interesting story and characters that keep you riveted to the end. Kind of action that you just can't put down once you start.
0,In The story of "Lost" we meet Maria, a young college student who is haunted by a horrific incident from her past. She's never dated and the whole idea of meeting someone and going on a date terrifies her. She considers herself broken and a part if her feels she's not worthy of a good man. The hero of the story is Owen. Owen is a TA for one of her math classes. He finds himself drawn to Maria, not only because of her beauty, which she attempts to hide, but because he senses the pain she's hiding. He senses it and relates because he has scars of his own he's hiding.		This story is a dark romance that tugs at your heart-strings. Both characters are so torn and battered, both emotionally and physically that you can't help but fall in love with and cheer for them. The author develops them well, and we see their transformations as the story goes along. (Maria more than Owen) The main conflict of the story is their individual battles to open up and realize they are deserving of the love they find in each other.		If your looking for a light-hearted story this isn't the one. But if you're looking for a deep, meaningful, well-written and edited story than you won't want to miss out on this.
0,Wonderful, series enjoying them very much.
0,Anastasia's mom is married and out of the house and she's thinking life will be easier until the bodies start piling up. Although it is apparent who is responsible for the murders, the mystery is solid. Can't wait for the next one.
0,ok, so this one was a bit more drawn out than the others but seemed rushed near the end. I am a bit lost in the plot now as well. I still enjoyed the main characters but the entry of so many new characters is a he'd spin. I am not sure I like this one but I give the series a 4 star.
0,I enjoyed reading this series, and it held my interest with well developed characters.  Thanks to the author for generously providing the work at no charge for Amazon Kindle readers.
0,This is a sexy, coming-of-age romance in a great setting: the late 1980s! Ruby, moving from St. Thomas to Boston for college, must choose between three very different men, each who have fallen for her. I dug the author's descriptions of place here, especially St. Thomas, and the way she described Ruby relating differently to the three guys she dates and how they each bring out different parts of her. If you like sexy New Adult stories with plenty of emotion, this is a good bet!		I received a copy of this book in exchange for a review.
0,Enjoyed the complete series.
0,This was a delightfully well written story full of secrets, doubt and a second chance at love. The characters are unique and you can't help but fall in love with each one. This author has such an incredible way with words that you feel like you are a part of the story. Loved this book, you definitely do not want to miss this one!
0,Tests is trying to run her father's casino while her enemy is in town.  Things get worse bandaid enemy has her husband killed at the casino.  Then it gets worse the the mob comes to town with the FBI in pursuit.  I all way enjoy Tess and her adventures.  Don't forget the hot guys as well.
0,Living in Maine, soup is a large part of our meals. I love to cook from scratch and am always looking for new soup recipes. Even though my soup recipe file is extensive, I found quite a few new recipes I can't wait to make.	I can't say I've tried any of the recipes yet, but being a seasoned soup maker, I can see these soups are going to turn out really well and some may even become favorites. I can't wait to make the Leek and Potato Soup and today I'm shopping for ingredients for the Vegetable Lasagna Soup.	The nutritional info is a plus as is the clickable Table of Contents. Recommended.
0,Fast paced and action packed. Jennifer and Amber fight to save their struggling business and then meet the devious Blackmores. Pushed into warring with each other and trying to prove deception. With guns blazing and a hot boyfriend, my pages flew!
0,What a great story! Sometimes it pays to be in the right place at the right time....some times it doesn't! This is a cute little love story that developed quickly and through the most unlikely couple, no thanks to a crazy ex, a powerful family, unrelenting paparazzi, good intentions, and	Spaghetti night! Hurry,can't don't miss this love story!
0,I loved this story.  I love how all the books in the series combine together.  I look forward to reading the next book.
0,I am SO happy to have Clan Jasani back!! I've missed how three men love their one and only woman. I loved Rayne's courage and strength, her witty attitude and overall personality. The only thing that confused me was the witch & tri-phase thing but knowing Laura Jo we will soon find out. I love how she's branching out into new territory. I cannot wait for the next book!!!
0,Holy hell! Loved it! Can't wait for more to come! Love the Steel Men! And their ladies! Love "the titty tyrant" LOL
0,The characters were ones that I think most married couples can relate too. When Jen and Mark look to spice things up they find that they have a strong marriage. Overall a really good introduction to the series and a fun read.
0,First book involving the band, Hammered, and I loved it.  Hunter, lead singer in the band, was on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine.  Did everyone buy the magazine for him as a singer?  No, the big sell was the visual seen in his pants.  Kennedy, is a top not PR person hired to help with promotions.  Enjoy this story as Hunter and Kennedy deal with life in the media world and also figuring out their hearts.  Book does end in a cliff hanger which is the only downfall. Luckily the next book is due out soon as I am anxious to see how Hunter, Kennedy and the rest of the band get out of the cliff hanger left at the end of this book.
0,You will not put these books down. 1and 2, this is what a good read is all about. Loved that there was a book 2, I was happy to have been a part of these characters lives. Sounds crazy? Not really. Do yourself a favor and pick both books up and see for yourself. One can only wish to find a love like these 2 have. Oh but what a journey it was. My heart broke so many times I wondered if I could stop crying. So glad that the Author took the time and let us know about the rest of their life's. Brilliantly written. The love scenes made my heart ache, the passion was so beautifully written it stops you cold or hot (smiles). Thank you again to the Author a job well done. HIGHLY recommended.
0,Great
0,You cant change the past no matter how much you may want to.		An accident puts Dominic in the ER. The same ER where Rebecca works. Seeing Dominic on the backboard covered with blood freezes her on the spot for a moment until she snaps back to doctor mode to take care of the man from her past.		Dominic is a Black Phoenix bassist with a past and a painful mistake made three years ago. When faced with the object of that mistake in the local ER, hes bombarded with emotions that he thought hed long buried.		Now they have a chance to put right everything that they did wrong. A second chance.		I fell in love with the characters from the start to the absolute finish. What I very much appreciated about this book was it didn't feel like I was reading the second book in this series. The story and the whole book was written in a way that, though I never read the first book, I knew the gist of what happened in that book without feeling like a load of information was dumped.		Also, the way it was written ensured that this readers knew and understood the other characters without veering off topic. I very much liked the band and the feel of family that the band and other friends gave off.		This was an emotional and sexy read.		originally posted at long and short reviews
0,I have enjoyed Ms Myers other novels but was amazed at the locale of this one, set in my home area of North Shore of Massachusetts.  The research she did about the area  around Salem and the Willows as well as her wonderful characters make me wish I could give it six stars.  I can't imagine  any one not enjoying this adventure/thriller
0,I had never read anything by Ms. Kramer before. My mistake. I really enjoyed this very different story. The plot development and characters were first rate.
0,I have thoroughly enjoyed each Shane Brown novel as well as his short story anthology and MELT is as good or better than all of them. Brown's novels are always page turners with non-stop action. This tale is unique in many ways.  A number of strangers are kidnapped and forced to participate in what might be a deadly experiment or possibly just retribution for their past actions.  They don't know why they've been abducted, or by whom, and neither do we. There's no logical reason for their ordeal and how is it that their captors know deeply hidden secrets about each captive? In typical Shane Brown style people will die - sometimes quickly, always violently and at times in the most imaginative ways. And along the way the author develops the characters well and ultimately provides a well-written ending that offers a cogent, realistic (though scary) explanation for what has occurred. And kudos to Brown for creating a quality novel that (with minor exceptions) takes place in one room. That cannot be an easy thing for any author to pull off successfully.		So many novels these days seem to be new spins on an old story but I cannot think of a similar plot to this one.  So if you like action novels, read this book!  If you like psychological thrillers, read this book! Like me I believe you will enjoy every minute of it.
0,1st time reading one of Ms. March's books. I wasn't sure about reading it, but it was tastefully done. I have 3 more of her books that I will now read.
0,This book was excellent in looking at the evidence in the house in which Meredith was killed.  The Italian police were so intent on proving Amanda Knox guilty that they couldn't even see the evidence, or lack of evidence. Reminds me of the Pharisees when Christ came, they couldn't "see" him as anything but a troublemaker.
0,This was the first Regency Romance I've ever read and I was pleasantly surprised. It usually takes me a week to read one novel. What can I say... I like to actually read and not skim. However, I read this one over the course of two days and was thoroughly captivated.		The characters had real depth and I thought about them long after 'The End' - to me, that's a high measure for any novel.		The heroine had a life-long desire to be with a particular person. But what does she really know about him other than he's gorgeous and rich? Then in walks the unexpected, but overwhelming protagonist. What's a girl to do? At a time when women were little more than arm candy and brokerage pieces, the heroine proves that, even then, women were the real strength.		I received this novel free in exchange for an honest review. I do not personally know the author, but look forward to reading more of her work.
0,Rylan is an assassin, travelling across the universe from mission to mission. One day though, he meets a man that gets under his skin. Rylan learned long ago not to listen to his cock  that way always leads to trouble, but theres something about Gold that draws him, that he cant resist. Full of sexy adventures and alternate planets, this is an adventurous, highly sexual story following an assassin whose work takes him all over the universe.		Written in the first person, this book grabbed my attention almost immediately. The sensual aspect of his dance and the calculated but not cold way the protagonist lures the king, seduces him and then completes his mission. This story was different, but it was the authors style and manner of writing that really sucked me in. I usually don't enjoy the first person perspective as it limits the story-telling to just the one set of eyes, but Mr. Cox has done an amazing job here. I enjoyed the sci-fi/fantasy aspect of this story, space ships and cruising around various planets, laser guns and all manner of weaponry. But still the characters weren't too alien. There were wealthy, paranoid security specialists and kings drunk on their own power  characters and people I could relate to and understand. That made me enjoy this story even though Im not usually a sci-fi fan.		When Rylans latest mission gets complicated, thats when I found the authors style really started to shine though. I found the characters interesting and they drew me into the story. While there is a lot of M/M sex, I found it hot and always consensual. I particularly liked the sense of adventure the authors writing gave the missions. It felt a bit like a futuristic story of derry-do. Even though Rylan is an assassin, he is a good man, a fair one, and this made me like him immensely, even if his job is to kill people. The only drawback I had reading this book is that it moves quite quickly. The scenes flash by and I felt like the story was a bit rushed  like I couldn't relax and linger over every action and scene. I also found the ending to be a bit unrealistic, but the romance reader in me just sighed happily and couldn't help but enjoy it.		I found this to be a hot, sensual story filled with adventure, space travel, murder and enough sex to singe my eyebrows. The characters were vibrant and interesting, the plot not overly convoluted but riveting and the alien landscapes thrilling. I greatly enjoyed this book and would happily read more from the author.		originally posted at long and short reviews
0,Sergei is an assassin who never expects to find anyone who will love him.  Jamie is a young and innocent woman with skills for piloting and fixing things.  This is taking place in the Mandrake Company series although we are talking about two individuals on the periphery.  The story was good.  It did start slow for me; then  picked up and the attraction built and built to its inevitable climax.	Worth the time.
0,Nelle L'Amour made the list of authors trying to kill me with the very first book in this series. It got reiterated with the second book, in fact, she actually moved up the list. I have been waiting for book 3 for what seemed like FOREVER, and she didn't disappoint in the slightest. WHAT AN EPIC ENDING! This book begins with Brandon knowing he messed up big time with Zoey, and he may never get her back after the mess he made. He's stuck marrying the evil witch Katrina Moore, as she has him by the balls this time with his career on the line. Zoey is trying to pick up the pieces of her shattered heart, and she feels absolutely stupid for falling for his BS. Will she find out the truth before Brandon marries the witch?		When I got this on my kindle, I didn't move until I devoured it. Character development has never been better, and an action packed, explosive, and well written story line flows perfectly. Nelle L'Amour is diabolically brilliant writing twists and turns for days. Every time I though I had figured it out, another twist throat punched me. Her very talented writing style hooked me from the very first paragraph of the first book I read by her, and has long since held me hostage, as I may or may not stalk her on social media to make sure I don't miss a thing. Well placed humor, aka a little dog, had me laughing until my stomach hurt, and the sexy scene goodness is SCORCHIN HOT! I'm ever so glad that I was given the chance to read this author, and I will be a crazy fan girl FOREVER! So I'm sure that everyone should be able to guess from my fan girl gushing that I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book, series and author!
0,I love it very much

0,Well as always Cali Mackay throws something at us but "HOTT DAMN" with this book. Never expected such intense and read "TWINS". Get your copy and start to try and unravel the secret.
0,From the moment  he made his appearance in the book at the bar, with his first words... "I'm Max" to Emma, the passion never ended. Emma flew to NY to attend fashion school, surprisingly the same gorgeous man she blew off in the bar the night before, happened to be on the plane with her. They deplaned and Max's parents met him at the airport. Max grabbed Emma, whispering to her, go along with what I'm saying please .... Her life would never be the same. He proposed a deal. He wanted his trust and she needed her tuition paid. He was a no commitment kind of guy, but hey we could have fun along the way right?  Time was up. They could now go their separate ways, but what happened during, and after kept your eyes and emotions spinning. What s great story. Made you feel so good inside, and omg! So sexy and hot!  Max was some hottie.
0,This book is good for all parents especially new parents. It teaches  us how to discipline out children and make them obey. This book guides step by step. I would recommend this book to any parents who have young children because, at this age, it's easy to teaches and treat them in how you want them to be.
0,I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review. I  really liked the MC'S Justin and Eric. It was nice to see an omega with a strong sense of self. I also really enjoyed the relationship between Justin and livy. It was an all around good read.
0,OK, the main character has a variety of faults, but he loves dogs. He also loves his family and friends, especially his fellow Marines from the war.  This is the author's wedge that drives the rest of the story.  Start this book early in the morning so you can finish it in one sitting, because you won't be able to put it down.  Just when you think you know what's coming... hang on because you don't.
0,Very sexy read. I loved Chay, he's a sexy as hell Native American Rodeo star, he's sweet and gentlemanly and did I say sexy? Didi wants to be taken seriously in her journalistic career and when she crosses the line and adds personal information into Chay's story she thoroughly regrets it. Their one night together is hot as hell and they both want more, well they won't admit it but they do. I wish it was longer, I wanted to know what's next for these two, I wanted to see if their relationship would work and I wanted to meet Chay's family.  Although very short I enjoyed the story, I love the rodeo and sexy cowboys...lol...4 stars review by upallnightreadallday.blogspot.com
0,The only Welsh detective that specializes in mystery dealing with the blues in Memphis is back. While he is closer to Scrooge than Santa, it is up to him to save Christmas for a beautiful dame and a bunch of retired... well let's just say they were very friendly ladies (for a price).(The City Union of Needy Tarts)		While this is part of a series, you can read it just fine without any real problems. I wouldn't call this that sweet of a story and probably shouldn't be read by kiddies. But it is fun and makes a nice introduction of the character.		The character does not seem to know about the past tense of verbs. I am guessing that is to show the character's Welsh accent. It can still be slightly annoying reading it though. Otherwise, a good story. I would rate it 3.5 stars.
0,4/4.5 stars		What I loved about this book was that even though it is part of a series it is different. It is written distinctly in the voices of Violet and Lincoln and had a whole different feel to it. This book was intense, just like the last two but it had this sweetness to it that added character to the over all feel of the book. Even though this book was about two different characters, I think you would seriously miss out on so much if you don't read the others first.		"He'd taken my entire life and my ability to live and cope/ It seemed to be the cruelest fate of them all."		This is how Violet feels after what happened in her past. She is a shell of the person she used to be, fighting debilitating demons that keep her trapped and isolated from the rest of the world. But it is time for her to move forward, to take back her life and visit the real world again. If it were up to her, she might have just stayed away but with some encouragement she decides to take a job at Pulse and work for her brother. One step at time and one foot in front of the other she is moving on. The highlight of her new job is the handsome fighter she had a crush on years ago.		Lincoln Hayes, the more sensible twin, is out of the AUFC for a few months because of an injury. Needing something to pass the time he finds himself working for Ash to help train some of the new guys. It doesn't hurt that he is also hoping to set his eyes Violet, the girl he didn't think he had a chance with all those years ago.		The budding relationship between these two is awkward at first as they tip-toe around each other while thinking very much the same things. Each is so worried about what the other might think they never think to ask. Lincoln doesn't want to mess up and Violet doesn't want to push him away. When they finally try each other on for size they are a perfect match, except insecurities and old flames might drive them apart.		I really enjoyed their story. Violet was a walking contradiction, while mousy and scared of the world she could speak her mind and had a seriously strong will. It took her a long time to see herself as others see her. Lincoln, while a times a dumb boy, had a heart of gold and true gentleman. This was a bit more mild and heavier on the story than the last two books but it worked really well for the characters and their story.
0,Ellen, owner of Wisteria TeaRoom, had a show to introduce a new member of the opera.  When Ellen and a police officer friend went to the opera that night, an actor was killed.  Ellen becomes involved in helping to find the killer.
0,Another fantastic tale from Vincent Hobbes, who is fast becoming one of my favourite writers.		This was only a short tale but I found it totally magical. It was like a Hansel and Gretel story for book-lovers. I was swept along with Hobbes's narrative, immediately able to picture the quaint little bookstore, that we sadly don't see so many of nowadays. The quirky characters only made the story more surreal and added a touch of humour to what was to become a very dark ending.		I loved this story. I would be even happier if such a bookshop existed in my town. :)
0,woo-hoo with these boys-  Cole the lover of all - sexy, caring and hardworking	I love the banter between him and Jax	we get some resolution from books 1&2 but theres still some unanswered questions lingering
0,I rated Unexpected with FOUR LEAVES. This was my first book by Mann and I enjoyed it. I loved the writing style and was hooked from the beginning. I didn't read the first book in this series so I wasn't sure what I was getting into but I loved it.		Karly is waitressing to make ends meet and to help out with her little sister who is left in an abusive home. Randy has a son who he can't see because of an ex who won't let him around. Karly and Randy come together and lean on each other in their times of need.	I'm definitely interested in this series and I can't wait to go back and read book one and I'm already looking forward to book two. Make sure you get both books and start them today!!		A gifted copy was provided by the author in exchange for an honest review by Lo.
0,This book grabbed my attention. I liked the characters. The book was free. I plan on reading all the series.
0,Loved this great story ... perfect for young adults. Great main characters & secondary characters as well. Wonder fun events within the story. A very gentle read.
0,Cami is a plus size beauty with a crush on her hot boss. A night drinking with friends changes her life. Fun and hot
0,First let me say that I am a big Tara Brown fan. I have read several of her books. But this book is my new favoite. I read The Lonley and I liked it but this book I loved. I think this is one of the few times that the sequel was better than the original. I loved getting in Eli's head. This is one of my favorite books now. This book just shows you that even though Eli has serious issues he is still capable love for sarah n for stewart. i just cant say enough about it. Loved It.
0,Great start to the series can't wait to read the rest of it
0,This book is really fun, and I would recommend it for feens, young adults and anyone who enjoys science fiction and adventure.  The protagonists are six teenage cadets (four boys and two girls) who, as winners of a space combat simulator contest, travel with the space-navy to take a training class on the planet of an alien species.  A war erupts and they are thrown into actual service with the fleet.  Thomas weaves a lot of history into his science fiction, and you can imagine the cadets as midshipmen in the Royal Navy of Napoleonic times, who could start very young (12 I think) and combined duties, including combat, with study and training.  You can listen to "Heart of Oak" as you read.		I have enjoyed all of Thomas' books I have read, and my main complaints about some of his earlier works were typos and women who behave like men.  Thomas must write really fast, which is great, as we get to read more of his work, and I think the proofreading is better on this than his earlier books.  Also his women cadets are much more believable than women warriors in his other books I have read, who sometimes come across as cartoon superheroes.
0,This book has well written chapters that provides a well detailed analysis of how to start implementing Willpower methods. It teaches various methods of succeeding from how to encourage yourself, dealing with stressful moments and problem solving techniques.  The author did a great job in keeping the chapters well detailed and straight to the point.
0,I'm happy with the way things turned out. I'm not sure about Roxy's ending though. I probably still would've beat that tail just because of the disrespect. But jasmine was the epitome if a lady. Everything worked out go the good.
0,Love forgiveness and betrayal but God's forgivenss and love the little girl and all the characters in her book and wow such a wonderful story and a part that make you cry ! A really good Christian romance book of the past the future and love !!!
0,If you're a regular on my blog you know that I am a JC Hannigan fan. Ive read ALL her books and Im pretty confident I will continue to do so. I love reading her words, watching her grow and feeling her moving, familiar and soulful love stories right through to my bones. Rebel Soul is no different. Writing a story that is a little bit different to her past books, the characters, the setting and the emotion in Rebel Soul is addictive and refreshing.  Set in a small town, Hannigan explores the importance of loss and the healing power of love. Not just love between a guy and a girl, but the very existence of love within friends, love within families and of course love within lovers.		Tessa Armstrong is all grown up and ready to make plans for college and fulfill her future dreams, her only problem is her father and brothers are stifling. Over bearing and over protective, its endless warning off all the boys in town  especially Brock Miller		Brock Miller is dangerous, or so everybody thinks  the truth a little easier to bear but very much a secret, means Brock Miller is a mystery. Back in town, and wishing he wasnt, seeing Tessa Armstrong all grown up is a whole lot of confusion. Addictive. Gorgeous. Confusion.		Attracted to one another, the chemistry is hard to deny. Well aware of the consequences of pursuing anything, the struggle between head and heart is real and very prominent for both of them. With that, the journey begins. Exploring family secrets, personal changes and typical stereotypes, Hannigan brings to life a well-written relationship. Filled with a perfect amount of complexity, her main characters offer a perfect balance of heart and soul. As her secondary characters add the depth needed to fall in love with the shenanigans of this small town and Brock and Tessa. Their desire for one another and their determination to make themselves and each other happy, makes Rebel Soul a beautiful depiction of the all encompassing impact of love.
0,Great read.
0,Today's review is on Brown Eyes by Quinteria Ramey		Brown Eyes is the second book in Ramey's The Forever Trilogy and was a sheer pleasure to read.  This novella packed such a punch that for a minute I couldn't believe I had finished.  I found the story so dramatic that many times I found myself on the edge of my seat.  Literally!!		Ana now has all of her memories back, and not to soon.  The vampires are declaring war against the witches of Brighton in retaliation for the "murder" of one of their own.  And though she receives a message from London giving her three days before the attack, it seems the vampires have a timeline all their own.		With the fate of Brighton weighing heavily on her, Ana chooses to leave the safety of the haven to possibly draw the vampires away.  This however is not what happens in the end.  Nearly all hope is lost as she makes contact with Darren and see's what's happening through his eyes.  Everyone is dying, even him.  In the end she has done what she always has.  She ran away with Tristan.		There were quite a few mistakes in Brown Eyes that should have been picked up by the editor, and that is one of my pesky pet peeves.  I actually can't wait for the next book to come out next month.  I hope it lives up to this one.		4 of 5 stars
0,If you're a fan you'll know that Harry and Taylor are never ever ever ever getting back together.  Thankfully that's not a 1D song but Little Things written with catchy tunesmith ginger tattoo-laden small martin guitar with paw on it singer Ed thingy is.  And they did a cover of a Blondie song as well and stuck on John Peel's favourite Undertones song Teenage Kicks on the end a wee bit.  Niall is from Ireland so he's bound to be musical and drunk as well.
0,Really enjoy this series. Hope there will be more to come. There is steam and a plot.  Some could take a lesson.
0,I do believe this is my favorite one yet. I love when characters cross over, and this one brought a little closure to Marshal. Loved Matthew, didn't care for Jazz at first until I found out the reason he was the way he was.  I love the ranch and all the men.  Great job!
0,Woohoo! Bianca Sommerland does it again!		Ive loved her Cobras and Higher Learning series with a passion, so I thought Id try this one out, and Im so glad I did.		Work is hard enough to get through for most people, but its even more complicated for Alder Trousseau. First, its a family business. One thats already killed his oldest brother, and if the death threats are anything to go by, his other brother, Brave, might be next. Second, when things get rough, he doesnt really get to escape because they're a band, which means hes trapped on the same tour bus or at the same hotel (usually). Third, Jesse, his best friend and the man he loves is currently dating Brave, who seems to hate him. And fourth, a model and former child star, Danica, has just joined the band and hes falling in love with her.		Yup! Complicated.		But Ander is strong, beautiful to the soul, and ber talented. He deserves a happy ending, right? All he wants is to find a way for his brother to be safe, for them to be close again, to love and be loved by Danica...and hell take friendship with Jesse if thats all he can have.		But shouldnt rock stars be able to have everything?		Maybe.		Yeah, this book is awesome! Love, sex, and rock and roll, and not always in that order. Well done, Bianca!
0,I love the quirkiness of the characters! The story is so engaging I started reading and literally was so engrossed that an hour had gone by and I didn't even realise it. Plus 3 bonus stories!!!
0,An interesting love story. Realizing you are a lesbian when you're married to a man can be challenging. But once you meet your life partner, everything will fall into place. Live your life how you want to live it not how somebody else wants it lived. I would recommend this book to my friends.
0,An excellent resource and well written book. Lots of good advice and practical techniques that anyone can implement right away
0,each one better than the others
0,Keep it coming, I am so wrapped in into finding out how Morgan grow's, how her relationship's with her client's evolve, even with Julianna. I see a little bit of every women in Morgan she is easy to relate to.
0,It seems that in this book you can come home. Just don't expect to be the same person you were before.	Take two arrogant people and throw them together and see what you get out of it. In this case you get two people who have learned you don't always need to be in the middle of everything.	A very touching and soul searching romance.
0,I really enjoyed unveiling this quick read.  Mary has always had a crush on Tyler her brother Brett's friend and fellow biker.  The Tribe needs to get a life and realize that shifters are worthy of life too.		I was gifted an ARC of this story in exchange for an honest review.  I have to say that this is my first Ms. Fanning story and I look forward to reading other stories as well.
0,The story line was straight to the point and not drawn out. It was entertaining and kept my attention.  Enjoyed it.
0,First of this kind of book that I have read. I liked it. It was exciting and kept me reading. Looking forward to more.
0,A wonderful book. I found Em Petrova by accident but I have become a loyal fan. I love this series and I highly recommend that everyone get this series. I think this may be the best book of the series. Go now and get the series you will not be disappointed.
0,AGAIN....a ruthless Corporate world. You ladies DID NOT DISAPPOINT. Thanks again. Can't wait until the last book in this trilogy.
0,I loved this book.  Childhood friendships last forever, turn to love that is everything.  2 best friends fall for their 2 best friends.  Great characters and storyline.  You will smile and you will cry.  I read this in one day and I am already reading book 2.

0,I have to say that I loved the series so much, but I had a major hesitation in reading this book.  I had in mind how it would play out, but I'm glad to say I was completely wrong!!  Getting to know Jack and "Anne" I a whole different light was so great. I loved this story.. It was breathtaking and beautiful. The epilogue was wonderful and seeing them all together was magnificent. Bravo!!  Amazing story to end a great series.
0,I had no idea that color was so important. This is a very interesting and enjoyable book to read. You will learn things about color that I bet you didn't know. You will find out which color is the real "you". I am a "blue with green flashes" and then Julia explains what that really means. I enjoyed reading this and the insight it gave me into myself.
0,This book is a great read. I fell in love with the characters from the beginning. I wanted to know their stories. The author has lots of action, adventure and true love.
0,When is the next book coming out loved they were able to come together.
0,I really liked this book can't wait to see where the next book takes the story I will definitely read the next book
0,I like this blog because it has oodles of free books, some I never would have heard of.  I like the way they are sorted by category, though I would like one for mysteries.  What I don't like is the alphabet soup that intrudes, sometimes making it unreadable.  For a mere $0.99 I've gotten hundreds of books.  What a deal!
0,Great read. Really enjoyed the storyline. Right amount of hotness, strong characters, suspense and surprise  twists, with secondary characters which support rather than detract from the story. I would very much recommend this book!
0,I found Time Without End to be fast paced and very easy to follow the story line. I'm still buzzing over what I have read. It was captivating to read about Dorian and Cora's adventures trying to escape danger and trying to stay connected while she is finishing her last semester of college. I can say I can't wait to read the next book to see what's going to happen next. Ending of the book floored me cause I still can't believed that happen and I'm still a little sad over it.
0,I honestly almost expected this box set to be like most of the other free or 99 cent sets I find, that is poorly edited and not always well planned.	I'm happy to say I was wrong, and I absolutely enjoyed all 4 stories (3 full and one short).	I'm not one to give spoilers, so I'm going to end here, but seriously, no matter what you pay or don't pay, you'll love this set.
0,Excellent read, it was good from beginning to end. I was not ready for the book to end yet.  #FANFORLIFE
0,Secret of the Gargoyles takes place approximately 3 months after book 2, Curse of the Gargoyles.		There are still comatose gargoyles throughout Terra Haven and even after three months of searching for answers, Mika is not any closer to saving the poor creatures. One of the gargoyles is the marmot she helped save from a null in book 2. After several weeks of being spied on by Celeste, a gargoyle from book 1, Magic of the Gargoyles, she finally approaches Mika with the Secret of the Gargoyles.		The fate of the comatose gargoyles has now been tenderly placed in Mika's hands. Knowing how to save them is only the first step. The next step is finding the location of the cure since it is veiled in magic for protection of all gargoyles. This requires trekking into an area that no human can survive and battling with the forces of wild magic that have claimed the land. Asking the Federal Pentagon Defense squad (FPD) is the next logical step in Mika's plan, only most of them are unavailable. She does manage to snag Marcus Velasquez, the guy she has a crush on, to go with her, Celeste, and Oliver, although he's not happy. This mission is wrought with danger and he can't sit idly by and let her go alone.		Terra Haven, the location of the Gargoyle Guardian Chronicles, is pretty ambiguous; it could be anywhere. This allows the reader to take the well-written descriptions and build their own version of the world Rebecca Chastain has created. Mika is a compassionate soul and we continually learn more about the depth of her compassion. We also see a part of her in book 3 that is quite different from the Mika of books 1 and 2. She learns the power and strength behind her gargoyle guardian abilities and what giving into them could mean. Is she strong enough to resist or not as she's pushed into a position that will make or break her? Marcus is such a patient and kind guy and I love his interactions with Mika. There is chemistry galore between them and love the subtle dynamics between them. Mika, however, has been so focused on the comatose gargoyles that she allowed herself to pull away from him and others.		Secret of the Gargoyles is a fantastic book. The plot of the story, the entire series actually, is unique and exciting. The story line packs such a punch that you can't help but be drawn into and fully engaged in the story. The emotional content in regards to the plight of the trapped gargoyles and Mika's passion to save them was realistic and Mika's emotions transfer to the reader.		This is a fun urban fantasy book that is fast paced and full of action and crackling with tension and uncertainty. The author did a wonderful job continuing the character and world development in Secret of the Gargoyles. I enjoyed the book and the series very much and hope to see the author write in this world a lot more. There are so many stories that still need to be told about Mika, Marcus, and Oliver.		This book is a verified Amazon purchase.
0,Simply Amazing! A wonderful end to a fabulous story!  This wraps up the series quite nicely and leaves all those nail biting questions throughout the series answered. Antonio is my hero!!!  What a twist with Maria too! Kudos Ami! Now do we ever get to dig deeper into Maria's story? Please say yes!!!  Truly a great series!
0,This story is about two people of royal linage who are destined to marry. Prince Erik has procastinated many years to be a playboy. Princess Anastasia is tired of waiting. They are to meet up in the USA to anounce the impending marriage. Neither have seen the other is over ten years...Now comes the part that is cloudy. Are they cheating on each other with each other? Well I would think so since neither know the other by site. Read this and decide yourself. I have my opinon which is on her side to a point. She gave up on him when he became a no show...he was chasing after a new conquest the night of the anouncement and was a no show. Elizabeth Lennox still intrigues me with her story telling.
0,History has a way of repeating itself. In good ways and bad. The past cannot be changed, but the outcome of the repeat can be changed.	In good ways and bad.	Beautiful story! The parts about Andrew and Clara&#039;s high school time brought back memories of mine.	Very vividly written I couldn&#039;t put it down!		I received a free copy of this book via Booksprout and am voluntarily leaving a review.
0,I loved this series.. finished all five books so quickly! I really loved Gave and Fiona. I can't wait to read more books by this author.
0,Hermoso, una historia muy bien escrita para atraparte, ya habia leido una historia de esta tematica pero no me enamoro como esta, Azminda supo compenetar a sus protagonistas para que aprendieramos a aceptarlos como ellos lo hacen.
0,I bought this book because I needed to do research about Benjamin Franklin for my history class, and I"m glad that in the process of my research I came to respect this man more and more. This book does a wonderful job of telling the story of a man who most of us don't really know much about. I always am inspired to learn that great and extraordinary individuals started out with humble beginnings, and Benjamin Franklin was no different in that regard. If you're at all a fan great historical figures, you're going to enjoy this one.
0,I am a huge fan of Kate Allenton, so when this book came out I had to read it! I really like how each story is from a different author but that both books are intertwined with one another. Both sets of storylines were well written and had lots of energy, with quick flowing words, which really makes you want to keep reading and not put the book down so you can find out what happens next. I loved how the characters were best friends and had each others backs. I also enjoyed some of the steamy sex scenes and the amount of teasing that was done to help show how much passion and sexuality both the main characters (Devlin St. Claire and her best friend Parker McKenna)have and aren't afraid to use against their leading men or even a demon! Both women are kick ass detectives for a special forces paranormal department in Paradise Falls. I can't wait to see what kind of trouble Zander has up his sleeve, also wondering what is in store for the owner of The Crystal Ball, you know that lady has a lot of secrets going on inside of her head! This is another must read for any person who loves paranormal mixed with action that comes in many different ways.
0,After losing her alpha trained guard Avan wants to be alpha of the Ozarks. She has to fight to be alpha.

Avan intended mate is mated to another and she is so dominant that she swears she could be no one's,mate. When laxer comes to her clan to help her she falls for him and they work together to be each other's mate. Great read. Must read the entire series. Will love.
0,I was so excited for this book, that I practically jumped up and down when I got an ARC to review for it. Oh who am I kidding? I -did- jump up and down. Major Misconduct is the beginning of a new series by the talented Ms. Kelly Jamieson. Do I sound bias? I may be, just a little bit. :D Ive never read a book by this woman that I haven't loved. That being said though, it means I also hold her books to a higher standard for myself and let me just say, she didn't disappoint me!		Lovey doesnt seem to have her life together, and if you ask her big brother Duncan, hed tell you that What Lovey wants, Lovey gets.. She comes off flighty and spoiled at first, but you come to find out there is so much more to this woman. She has a big heart, she loves her big brother to pieces but shes always been in his shadow. She wants to do something with her life, something she enjoys and shes finally decided its time to do it. Now to just convince everyone else that she can. So she packs up and arrives on her Duncans doorstep only to meet his Aces teammate, and Captain of the Aces, Marc Dupuis.		Marc is the incredibly dependable guy that everyone relies on. Hes the Aces team captain and he takes that seriously. Always the first on and off the ice, always the one making sure the other players are where they need to be. He didn't know his world was about to be set on its head when he woke up one morning to stumble sleepily into his living room. His roommate had a guest, who just happens to be his younger sister. Then he finds out shes moving in		There is instant attraction between these two, a major case of lust but Marcs not going to fool around with his team mates baby sister. The Aces even have rules about that! He fights it tooth and nail, all while Lovey isn't fighting it at all but instead flaunts herself in front of him. What makes it worse, she doesnt realize shes doing it, or how much shes tempting him.		Or so he thinks		I loved everything about this book, from the characters, the story, the banter within it. For me it was a perfect mesh of everything that makes a good romance. Oh and did I mention the slight amount of angst? Not so much that you want to bash someone with your Kindle, or book, or any implement of choice, but just the right amount. I am excited and more than ready for the rest of this series. Im not big on sports romances myself, or even hockey, but Kelly Jamieson and this series is changing my mind. If you love a good sports romance, I would recommend this one in a heart beat!
0,Shelbi obviously wrote about some things she is very familiar with.  Her teenagers are very believable as are the relationships between the main characters.  The past life memories and developing plot was well done.  A great story, well edited, and no loose ends.  Good read!
0,Christian Fiction Author, H.H. Fowler has outdone himself with Book 6 of the Real Love series. In this book we find Sasha and Levi in yet another dilemma because despite the fact that Sasha is married to Levi's best friend--who is a pastor, no less--these two can't keep their hands off each other. And once again, they get caught. Their little tryst and Levi's attempt to remove himself from the situation and Sasha's presence result in even more chaos. Whew! I just can't with these two!		Then there's the madness with the women in Soca artist, Armando Beckford's life. Both his pregnant wife, Annalise and his back-in-my-life-please-stay former girlfriend, Rena are crazy, but in this book, wifey takes the cake. You have to read it to believe it.		Now after all the drama Kevin and Hunter (female) went through with Kevin's crazy former fling, Shiloh, you would think Hunter would have thrown in the towel, but I guess real love stays, because they are still going strong. I'm not sure I'd stick around, though, because I detected a subtle hint that Ms. Shiloh may make an appearance in Book 7, The Finale. So what do you think? Is it enough drama for you? I loved this book with its non-stop goings-on and its Real Housewives-type shenanigans. Author Fowler creates characters you both know and feel and want to hear about again and again. He infuses redemption, forgiveness, salvation and Godly wisdom into each of his books, and not as just an after thought. He doesn't just take his characters to church, they come away with new life. And if you pay close attention, you will too. So get the whole series and be prepared for the upcoming finale in Book 7. H.H. Fowler promised us a wild ride and he always delivers.
0,OMG can't wait for more of Mr. Grey!!!!
0,I absolutely loved Scott and Kelly's story and was so happy that they were able to find their happy ever after.
0,This is actually the first book I read from this author. I loved it. Her writing is so smooth and flows so easily. I can't wait to delve into her other series now. These characters are fabulous. Why can't all guys be like Colin? Yes he has some secrets, but the way he took over for his family and sacrificed his life is just so sweet. The way he is with Della... ahhh. And Della is strong, passionate, and caring. The way she cares for Colin and his boys is wonderful. The banter between the secondary characters, especially Tressie, is hilarious. This story is a fairytale come true and was such a joy to read. Can't wait to read what happens to the other Sinclairs. I was given an advanced reader copy.
0,The Aeronauts Windlass by Jim Butcher		I dearly love the Harry Dresden books but I think Butcher has outdone himself with this new series.  Skyscraper communities that avoid the surface of the planet and trade and war with air ships provide the setting for this intriguing book.  As normal with Butcher the relationships and depiction of courage, honor, loyalty and other laudable characteristics are imbued in his characters.		Butcher does a superior job in creating an environment that is uniquely his.  The people are the strength of the story but his stage setting provides the glue that makes the plot soar.		References to possible creatures in future books merely whet the appetite for more reading.  The sentience and behavior of cats as exhibited by Rowl certainly show Butcher has had plenty of exposure to the egocentric felines.  I have mentioned repeatedly that anthropomorphism is one of my favorite subjects.  Butcher does a very good job with that.  Inklings of sentience in aspects of transportation set up the potential for some interesting future communications.		I highly recommend the book.		web site:[...]
0,I received a digital ARC of You're Not Broken via Hidden Gems for the purposes of providing an objective review.		Friends to lovers or second chance romances are my romance trope catnip, and You're Not Broken was a bit of both, with more emphasis on second chances than on friends to lovers.		Kat and Jason meet one night in her uncle's diner, she senses his loneliness, and spends a little time with him after her shift is over. It's the first and last time she sees him, for over two years - he's deployed overseas. They write at first, then his letters stop, and Kat grieves for a while, then decides she needs to just get over him and move on. She's got too much crap to do to waste any more time on this guy.		Her family life is rife with tragedy throughout the book; she's a big sister holding the family together almost by sheer will, and her stubbornness comes in handy while Jason's gone.		No word from Jason for over two years and she runs into him again in a most unexpected place. She's cold and dismissive with him, not without reason. Jason's pretty determined to make some sort of amends, though, and he keeps showing up.		So far, despite the poor editing and numerous grammatical errors, I'm enjoying the story. Hart has me hooked, even if I am reading with a mental red pen in hand. Oy vey.		Then, the sex happens. It's a romance, so sex is gonna happen. I like a good raunchy sex scene. Well, frankly, I LOVE a good raunchy sex scene. But the section with the sex in it is decidedly different from the rest of the book, almost as if two different people wrote the disparate segments. It's also out of character for both the heroine and hero - in this case, the language changed, with the descriptions getting coarser and the characters going from zero to sixty in one weird scene.		When I read the first bit of it, my first thought was, "In the diner? With all the frakking windows? No way would she do it there. No way would he subject her to the potential humiliation of being seen. And what happened to all his objections? They're just magically swept away?" I still have a really hard time believing these two did the deed in full view of anyone who might have been outside. On top of the difference in writing, that took me out of the story entirely. Their first time deserved a little more thought put into it.		My favorite line was one which truly resonated with me: "If anything, I feel more useless and inept the older I get. I think it's because I keep comparing myself to who I thought I would be by now." For much of my adult life, this was a core part of my consciousness - comparing myself to the myself I thought I'd be and coming up way short. I get Kat, in that way at least.		Final evaluation: Good story. Promising writer. I'll be watching Gemma Hart in the future. With the help of a good editor or at least a proofreader, she has the potential to be great.
0,Third in the series, and I have enjoyed these stories. This story is about Cait, a widow with unresolved issues, and Iain, clan chief and the reason Cait is a widow. Cait has never faced the reasons for her need for solitude. She has a big heart though and puts herself in danger without thought. Iain is locked up in his own feelings until he really looks at Cait. These were troubled times in Scotland, and everyone had to be careful what they said and to whom. Cait and Iain risk their own lives for others and each other. I enjoyed how their love grew from their anger, and I highly recommend this story.		I received a copy of this book through Netgalley, and this is my unsolicited, honest review.
0,What a low down story.  Sorry man, sorry mama.  Who would want to marry her daughter's x man.. so what mama knew the whole story and Kevin knew the whole story...they are both SLUTS & LOW DOWN!!
0,The truth is when you love you have to show that love even when there are poor choices made....can't wait for more.
0,Elle and Graeme have intrigued me since Seductive Reasoning, the first book in this series. Mel definitely did not disappoint. She dealt with Elle's past so well. I loved how Graeme was so patient with her and her past. We had previously learned a little in the last book, but it all comes to light in this book.		This time the mystery is a cold case that has Graeme teaming with Elle and the rest of TFH. A child's murder that keeps you on your toes in figuring out who the bad guy is. I was a little concerned but as always Mel made it suspenseful but with a HEA. The fact we see Del and Emma's wedding, the rest of the Task Force Hawaii, and Jin just made this book even better.		There is romance, intrigue and Graeme in a kilt. You couldn't ask for more. I highly recommend this book.
0,What I love about Jami's books is that they just get better and better. I've been wondering what would come of the wild, free spirt, Bella. She had a rough journey, and she wasn't sure about herself, but Cedric was there when she needed her most.		Dealing with violence in writing is hard, and I think she approached it very well. There are a million and one ways that one will react, and I feel like this shows one very realistic way that someone might handle it.		I love how Jami keeps us up to date in the lives of all the past characters, and weaves together the world which you can tell she's truly passionate about.
0,I've been eagerly awaiting "By The Rules" and while this is the third book in the series, it can easily be read as a standalone.		I love Elisabeth's writing style. It comes across as simple, however, it immerse the reader in the world she created. The style is easy to follow and allows the emotions of the character to flow though the words and onto the readers. You, as the reader, connect with the characters and fall for them. When they are happy, your heart smiles and when one is going through something difficult, you cry along with them. She truly has a gift of making her readers feel.		From the moment AJ Fabinfirst appeared in At the Stars (Evergreen Grove, #1) and became a favorite secondary character in the first and second book of the series, I wanted him to have his own story and his own HEA. AJ is the BFF, the guy who is always there and the defender of those who can't defend themselves. Yet, he keeps people at a distant. Never really letting them see him deep inside.		Hayden was breathe of fresh air that he didn't seem angry or upset at the feelings he was having towards another man. I'm happy Elisabeth didn't go down that road. He was willing to explore the emotions and not concerned with labels.		I loved that this story wasn't about labels. There wasn't a need to have Hayden identify as gay vs. the fact that the was attractive and wanted to be with AJ. It was a story of not only self discovery but allowing oneself to be true and accept who we are and be happy with it.		The story was great to read because it really was a story about two individuals accepting the fact that they deserve to be loved and could be loved for being themselves.		There were a few tropes that brought a few twists and an "OMG" moment to the story. however, Elisabeth's story telling abilities are shown here were these tropes don't make the reader role their eyes but rather go "awwww".		Overall, a great addition to the series and I'm extremely happy how things played out. Can't wait to the next installment!
0,This is a very good book the story line is good and is just well written. I have bought all of this series and have enjoyed each and every one of them. I would recommend this series.
0,A ok little read perfect for a lazy weekend not bad
0,Just from the title and the cover, I knew this book was gonna be different. How can you not appreciate talent that will step outside the box and knock it out of the park. I applaud the hardwork and dedication this author has put in her work. Great job for trying something new and succeeding. Looking forward to reading the sequels.
0,Virginia Henley has done it again! I saw swept away by the captivating setting and engaging characters. The hero was strong and determined and held my admiration most of the time. The only incident when I was irritated with him was when it seemed he was courting the heroine's sister. There were a few errors as well, but they were easily forgiven with the awesome story.
0,I was gifted this book by the author for an honest review.		I was certainly surprised by this story, but I loved it.. Although there is Sci-Fi in it there is also paranormal, Annora has successfully combined both brilliantly.		There is much intrigue and mystery that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the story.		There is a lot of history in it also which I love, I used to read Historical Romances before becoming a fan of paranormal and I must say that the combination is very refreshing to me.  This looks to be a very good series and I do hope that Annora plans to continue writing about these mysterious beings that might very well be real and living among us.		I highly recommend this book, it's very well written
0,I am hooked on this author! I love her books, she combines life and love brilliantly. I will definitely be reading the rest of this series!
0,All the kings men good series I recommend it
0,I thought I knew everything about Bob Hope: I'm 59. I've seen replays of his USO tours from several wars, though not his last one.	When he went to the middle east, to Desert Storm, no filming was allowed. Since women had to be veiled, they just didn't come. I wonder if they were afraid the wind would blow, show their chins, and start a worse battle than the one we had. I wonder.	Hope started his USO tours May 6, 1941, even before the US entered WWII. He performed for troops in training at a base in CA. When the United States was at war, he went to entertain the troops; if the United States was in a police action, ditto. (That's what they called Korea, just after WWII.) And though certain people tried to influence him not to go to Vietnam because they felt it was immoral, he went anyway. There were Americans in muddy, bloody uniforms, far away from home-how could he not go?	The second thing I knew about Bob Hope was his lengthy marriage. Boy, did I get a kick in the skull!! Delores Hope was wife number two. Yes, they still had a long, long marriage, but things were not always happy in the Hope household. If I read those stupid newspapers by the checkout line, I might have known that, but I don't like gossip and I don't believe the idiot stories on the front pages of those papers.	I guess all that matters is that Bob always went home to Delores and she was always willing to take him back. Their children might have had something to do with that.	Yes, children! I didn't know about them either, but you'll have to read if you want detail.	And I knew about his golfing addiction; I'm married to a golf addict myself. He's on the course now. It was 43 degrees this morning and it rained yesterday, so the golf cart has to stay on the path today. He'll have to walk to where the ball lands, but he doesn't care: he's an addict. He's even hit 2 hole-in-one's in his life, all witnessed.	But Bob Hope has golf tournaments named after him. He once played in a foursome with three remarkably important men, probably the only time these guys had ever gotten together on a golf course. And I bet they only did so because Bob asked.	And of course, there's Bob's acting career: all those 'Road' pictures. Personally, I liked Paleface better than any of them, but that's just my opinion. Still, there's a lot to be said for the rapport Hope and Crosby had.	Which brings me to the end. All of us have one. When Bob Hope left this world a certain newspaper printed an appropriate cartoon on their op-ed page, a cartoon that brings both a tear and a smile: should I tell you?	This time I think I will: Bing Crosby welcoming Bob Hope to Heaven.	You know I've left out a great deal: Hope's boxing career (no joke), his experiences in vaudeville, introducing silent movies, how he made the transitions in his career, why he became a survivor, or maybe that's how he became a survivor.	In any case, this is a wonderful book.
0,Very good series
0,Thank heavens the book ended... I haven't done anything but read since I downloaded it!  I absolutely LOVE the way the sisters come together.  I mean, I like reading about them separately too, but together, it's awesome.  This is absolutely a must read but I warn you... make sure the dishes are washed and the laundry is done because you will not stop reading.
0,The only "bad" thing I can say about this book is that I wish it was longer.  Just when it was getting really good...it was over.  I read this after reading SALTY 1 & 2.  I would still recommend this author to anyone.
0,This charming book isn't just for cat lovers (but if you are a cat lover - you have to have it!). And it isn't just for kids (although my son loves it a lot!) Incredible adorable pictures and cute cat questions and answers. Everybody Loves Myshayo by Julia Busch is sweet and wonderful. Everyone will love this book! 5 easy stars.
0,I loved the brothers and i liked how the book flowed. I wish it was all about more brothers.
0,An interesting plot with a simple case that escalates into a major one.		Lots of action Orcutt did a good job of describing so that it was easy for the reader to follow what was happening.		Plenty of surprises.  One was a bit out of left field but made perfect sense.		Good enough that Ill read more of these books.
0,Oh i love this book. It's so cute and to think it's free what more can you ask for. If you want a short story to enjoy while waiting in line or inside a doctor's office for the secretary to call you, this is the book for you. It's a feel good book,it's so cute (I said it again) and romantic. Highly recommended.
0,The characters all transition nicely. Thought it might get a little booring but it does not. Still the same issues with editing. Theses are minor overall as this is a nice fast read
0,The book was good I wish it had been a little bit longer. But it was still good to read.
0,So I have a lot of books that I have read, but this series has stayed true from book 1. Usuall I avoid sequels because sometimes it just seems to repeat the previous book. ......but Oh no.... Callie Hart has kept wanting more everytime. Canot wait to get book 4, Ugh!
0,LOVE THIS SERIES!  FAST PACED AND GREAT STORYLINE.  Plan to read all books in series and just bought #6.  Highly recommend for lovers of fantasy and sci-fi.
0,I absolutely loved this book and i have to be honest and say that this was my favourite so far. In the first two books, you get a taste of Ella and Danger and i was dying for this one to be released. Ella is a fantastic character and i loved her relationship with Chad, her band mate. She is so confused throughout the book especially since Danger and Chad are so different. I was gripped from the start because i needed to know who she was going to pick but K E Osborn is very good at having the story go one way and then dramatically change it and it goes in a completely different way. Fantastic and one to definitely read!
0,The first few pages drew me in. It was a pleasure to read words crafted with such detail and care. There's an art to it that Ms. Remiel has complete control of. Her articulation gives you the ability to step right into the story. I get great joy from reading such well crafted work.		What I didn't like? Only that it was too short, but that was because I enjoyed it so much. I knew the length of the book when I got it, so really? There's no basis whatsoever for my dislike.
0,From the start I loved the writing style, easy and flowing and real. Basically its a mystery. Flo, suffering from Alzheimers disease, is a resident at the Happy Hearts old peoples home and the name couldn't be any further from the reality of life in this awful establishment. Brittany has just started work at Happy Hearts; she may be young and highly embarrassed at her first meeting with Flo but shes not the shrinking violet she at first appears to be  Brittany has ambition and guts and Flo is the very person, the very reason, to finally bring her true character to the surface. With the help of her mum and friends she begins to investigate the goings-on at Happy Hearts and, as she does so, her regard and fondness for Flo grows.	There is also so much more to Flo than first meets the eye. She has led a very interesting and productive life but, we learn, she still has more to do. What I particularly liked about this story is the way Flos illness is represented. She seems to have moments of confusion and moments of clarity but the feisty Flo of former years is definitely still there, so much so that there were times when I questioned the real extent of her condition. Having close experience of mental illness I know that this is the true dilemma of family, friends and carers, the terrible uncertainty and the constant evaluations, never quite knowing if you have a true handle on the situation.	Having said that, there is a symbiosis between the two women, young and old. Flo is never the defensless old lady waiting for rescue; she is as determined to help her young protg as Brittany is help her.	The relationship between Flo and Brittany is at the heart of the story and the author manages this with a humour and warmth that never detracts from the overall plot.	Very, very enjoyable!	Oh  and I loved the cover.
0,I just finished reading  Uprooting Erine book 2 of a cozy mystery series. If you like amateur sleuths and a lot of humor too you will enjoy this one. I couldn't put it down from the beginning. The main character Jane Delaney is known by everyone as the Death Diva. At first with that name I thought it might have some paranormal in it which it doesn't. I like that it was a different type of mystery I haven't read with a character like her. Jane does tasks for her clients loved ones that have passed on. She makes sure her clients understand that she doesn't dig up caskets to add items, hold rituals over them and anything that is not legal. She has a toy poodle she is in charge of named Sexy Beast and there is also a cast of interesting characters. There's even some romance two men vying for her attention that include a ex husband and a man she calls Padre who is a mystery to her.		The story takes place in a cemetery on a dark day after a storm. Jane and Sexy Beast are there following through on a client's wish when they discover the skelton. When her friend is accused of the murder she sets out to prove she's innocent. Also she gets herself in a hilarious situation with the media while trying on lingerie. Also she has humorous and sarcastic thoughts thru out the whole story.
0,I received an ARC in return for an honest review and I can truly say that i absolutely LOVED this book! I am a huge fan of Lisa Swallow's Blue Phoenix series and once again, she has hit it out of the park with The Same Deep Water! This book is one that will touch your heart and soul right from the start and draw you in further, page by page. Guy and Phe are complex characters that will stay with you long after the story ends and make you really think long and hard about life and what makes it worth living. This book is about love, loss, heartbreak and pain and in the end, finding happiness and living your life rather than letting the sadness and despair suck you under the water and destroy everything. Lisa Swallow takes the reader on an epic journey that starts with Phe on the edge of darkness and ready to jump off the ledge. Guy steps in and makes Phe see that life is worth living as they tick off items on their bucket list. His love of life and laid back attitude opens Phe's eyes to a world that she never could see before. As I watched their relationship develop from "travelling partners" to so much more, I couldn't help but root for what I felt they both deserved---the happily ever after future that they both knew they'd never have. But, what lies beneath the surface isn't always what it seems and The Same Deep Water delves "deeply" into this area in the most amazing way. As we learn more about the characters and what they are facing, we root for them to find happiness when things look bleak and hopeless. This book deals with serious issues and Lisa Swallow navigates them expertly, letting the readers experience the highs and lows, gaining some insight into what those with and those around mental illness experience. Once I started the book I couldn't put it down until the last line was read. Honestly, I was expecting the book to be sad but what I really felt was a mix of emotions that, ultimately left me full of hope and faith. This is one roller coaster ride that is absolutely worth the price of admission!
0,This short story was charming and the characters were delightfully drawn. The writing sparkled with wit and a light touch which suited the topic.
0,I really enjoyed this book more than I thought I would. Just wish it was longer and 2nd part would come out soon. I hate cliffhangers.
0,Holy hotness this series is so good it will definetly be added to my list of favourites. Jameson is so bad but I love him and Tate is both vunerable and fierce. I am still loving the storyline and even though it is the third book in the series it is just a exciting as the first. If you like your romances a little dark and twisted you definetly need to check out this series
0,Read this one also as they all go along with the story,
0,This is a book of fantisies.  James takes the reader on a journey of Talia, who is the desire of two men.  One Talia is in love with, the other she's in sex with.  The story will keep you turning the pages to see just how twisted her pleasure really are.
0,formula book, which is what I wanted!
0,This book is amazing, I love all the sex scenes in it. It was super intense though. Thanks for writing it.
0,When I read this book description I knew I had to read it. I am so glad I did. I got caught up in it so quick. It was very interesting and I loved Sophia. Wow what a hard place she was put in. But she did everything a normal person would do.		Marc was very intriguing to me as well. I wish he opened up more, but I understand it has to be hard for him. I loved loved loved the last few pages of the book and can't wait for more!!!		Excellent book and writing!
0,Though it is short, this is a nice introduction to transcendental meditation. It is great for people that are just starting and want to know the basics about the subject. I really liked the chapter about how to deal with stress.
0,I love Allie K. Adams books.....sexy hot and humorous!! Hiring the Player is book 2 in the Campus Players series.

Kayla has always been a girl that plays by her own set of rules.....Jake is about to change all that, 'cause he's a rule breaker!! After a freak accident gets the apartment building they both live in condemned, the two are talked into living together, temporarily. Kayla's three BFF's "Hire" the very sexy Jake to "take care" of Kayla for the next three weeks. He is to fulfill three wishes bestowed upon him by her friends without Kayla's knowledge. What happens next is a wild ride to say the least.

We get revisited by Grooming the Players couple Emma & Ryan. Emma's BFF Britt and Kayla's friends, Shannon, Ciara and Mel are all great additional characters to this story.		I'm already looking forward to the next book in this awesome new series and recommend this great read to those who love a good laugh, hot sexy love scenes and a happy ending!!
0,This book was an amazing hot read. The way the two characters knew each other before, but never really hung out together. They both suffer from different things, but they are the same in a way. I can't wait to see how this all plays out, because what they had between them, does not happen to everyone.
0,Can't wait till part 2 comes out. Page after page was great, Stayed up till 3 in the morning just to finish it
0,It's such a delightful series! The characters from previous books appear regularly that you still feel connected to them. Excited to read on....
0,Jasper only knew human life until he woke up to see two people who he would do anything for, Autumn and Gunner  both knew Jasper was theirs just have to convince him to return to the human world with them.
0,The typos in this volume was irritating. They constantly broke my concentration of having to go back and rereading until I got used to it. The ebooks need to be edited better. The content was good and flowed well. I don't see how he will end this with just one more volume. I can imagine at least two more if not more.
0,HOT!!!

Processed foods have damage our health in many ways like sugar. Written in a motivating, and easy-to-understand style which nice quality picture. It has lots of chicken recipes that I am please with. For a few weeks now I have been trying to start eating healthy but it was not successful. I tried all types of online recipe but the food did not turn out great so I decided to purchase this book with good review to try it out and I truly love it. The recipes are easy, simple and delicious. It gives an explanation of the clean food option, which makes it easier to help people that want to know the answer to. Mainly website that provide diet food are recipes for vegan but this book include both vegan and meat which I love. Another great thing about this book is that its an online version so I can carry this around when I cook and can go grocery shopping for the stuff I need by looking through my phone. Overall I would recommend to all my friends and family. You can eat clean with all types of meat recipe they provide. Trimming and cutting out the fat is the best ideas to improve and lose weight faster. I have proven that with the diet this book provide. Whole grains I believe are essential, but I would be nice to have a little more detail into what they would consider whole. They believe that taking away bran from the oats or wheat or any grain would still be considered whole grain but I do not think so. The grain is made up of bran, endosperm and germ. Manufacturers separate these now and because of that, it has been leaving buyer confused about what is whole grain. This book is loosely covered on diet and to exercise even. It was a fast read before getting to the section I needed. This book needs to be in more detail of eating clean. The author believes that GMO is fine, because it isn't even mentioned.

0,This one really makes you think.  It could happen to anyone.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat and was very hard to put down.
0,I fell in love while reading Alex and Olivia's story in a beautiful mess series and thought no way could another one of her characters make me feel that way again. I was so wrong! Tyler, Alex's younger brother has found a place in my heart. He is charming, sexy and determined to change. Mackenzie or Serefina, whatever you want to call her, is incredible in her own way. She had her entire life taken away from her at young age and didn't know what was going on. From the moment on and after losing her mom, she was determined to not fall for men and focus on herself. Tyler managed to break thru all her walls but it wasn't that easy. He had to work for it. He is also hiding a secret from her, which destroys everything they have worked so hard for. I love these two together and I love how she brought the Burnham family back into this book. This book will leave you gutted and aching for the next book. T.K., you have a fan for life with these burnham men. You really know how to tell a story and bring characters to life. I will recommend this book to all my friends.
0,I love this book
0,Travel memoirs are my bookish kryptonite. Living vicariously through the words of lucky travelers who bravely head out into the world, I really do enjoy reading about the adventures of others. Frequently I can picture myself heading out myself on a similar excursion, visiting ancient ruins and relaxing in small Parisian cafes. Occasionally, however, I run across a book where the trek is so crazy exotic and extreme that the book manages to fascinate me and scare me to death at the exact same time! Those books, the ones that take me WAY beyond my own personal comfort zone, are often my favorite. Such is the case with Island Explorer by Dan Scheffler.		Nowadays Dan Scheffler is a family man and general practitioner living in South Africa. There was once a time, before the responsibilities set in, when Scheffler left everything behind in search of adventure. What he found was a four month sailing excursion through South Asia all in search of the perfect wave.		Island Explorer is most definitely a surf book, however a vast majority of the book is actually all about the journey sailing to the waves and the colorful cast of misfits Scheffler encountered along the way.		What drew me into this book was the travel adventure that took place out of the water. Starting with an excruciatingly long bus ride with the locals, Scheffler headed off to rendezvous with a sailboat after seeing an ad in a surf magazine that read "Wanted: Six guys with guts." Once he arrived at the boat, the next four months included trying to dodge real-life pirates, being abandoned by the captain, and sharing a bunk with newly hatched family of baby scorpions all while trying to stay healthy in a place that was at least two days travel from a decent hospital. From a first mate that is going "troppo" to malaria-carrying mosquitoes, Scheffler details the mundane in poetic detail.		Now to be clear, I am not a surfer. I have actually never been on a surf board in my life! Due to my own limitations on the subject of waves, I truly didn't understand a lot of the surfspeak such as breakers, right-hander, set waves, cascading lip and open faces to carve. I'll defer to the experts to review the surfing passages in Island Explorer, although let me say that several of the surfing experiences in this book sounded REALLY scary/brave/cool to me.		If you are a fan of adventure travel, Island Explorer delivers. And although this book is a book about surfing written for surfers, it is the journey that shines through.		Rating: 4.5 stars		Great quote:  "No matter how many travel brochures I look at or how many holiday pics I see, tropical sunsets continue to captivate me. When the sun is in just the right place, the golden glint on the leaves of the palm trees transforms the skyline from a mere hint of what lies beyond to a brilliant facade for just a few moments. My imagination magnifies that picture in to a wonderland. And then that fleeting glimpse is gone but for the memory of it in my mind." (2369/2849 which is what my ebook says instead of page numbers)		I received this ebook complimentary from the author in exchange for an honest review but the opinion in this review is all mine.
0,First let me say I loved the book - but I deeply care about the characters in it.  They're flawed, real, fierce & fabulous.		Recommended.
0,Story is familiar with intriguing characters. Wish it weren't a serial story, but one volume.
0,I read this book wanting a good cowboy-type read. I wasn't disappointed. Although it wasn't a traditional western cowboy book (it takes place in Florida and the girl is on a horse farm), there was LOTS of heat. I enjoyed the story a lot and there was good build up between Mason and Kayla. I would love to read about the other characters!
0,A very short read. This three scene book is more like a prologue to what could be a great read. The plot, friends to lovers, can easily lead to a whole lot of different directions if the author where to continue the story. Even though it was a short 15 minute read I gave this book 4 out of 5 stars because it was well written with just enough information for the story to make since. The chemistry between the 2 main characters is believable, while the hot & steamy scenes will make you fan yourself.
0,Mace what can I say about this alpha male but sorry I had you all wrong.  I didn't think you would touch my heart.  Didn't think I would cheer for you.  Didn't think I would want to crawl into your book world and give you a hug instead of a butt kicking.  Didn't think you would be so caring and selfless but boy I was wrong.  So Mace sorry for having you pegged as a heartless playboy.  I am truly happy I was wrong.  Lane Hart has yet again created a story that touches my soul and made me feel.  So this is a must read and please don't make the mistake I made get pass the first chapter before you decided what kind of Man Mace is.
0,Anyone who loves westerns will enjoy this one. But I suggest you start with book one. I haven't found one that I haven't enjoyed yet.
0,I really enjoyed Evil. I have had it sitting in my TBR forever it seems. I finally started on chapter one and devoured almost the entire thing in one day! ( I would have finished it but sleep came calling) Kellan is one amazing character! I am a bit jealous of Shay right now. Who wouldn't be!
0,The young, recently returned from war to find his parents dead, scarred (and scared) David Lumley is intent on drinking himself to a haze, when the woman he loves interrupts him.  unfortunately, alcohol does have a tendancy to lower inhibitions, and he makes a total -- well, let's just say, he really hurts his chances.	The characters are loveable and well-filled, the locales nicely described.  I was very impressed, for example, with the description of the burnt house...	This is a relatively short story, but I still cried at the end (that is a compliment, the highest I can give.)
0,Wicked. Insane. Unbelievable. This book is not only dark but a psych thriller, at least to me it was. Getting to see Jude Macknight in action was alarming!  Any woman who passed his cross be damned!!!	Haley, down in the dumps, a life so altered and disturbing, no wonder she went to work at the oldest profession. But what that did was deliver her to Devils doorstep ripe for the picking.	While I did enjoy Dustin and his help where Hailey was concerned I didn't understand their relationship.  If she couldn't confide in him her deepest fears bc of fear of his reaction, that makes me question their trust. Hayley's entire world revolved around Jude until the very end.	When the hair in the back of her neck prickled so did mine. I couldn't put this book down. If you love this book read the "Truth and Consequences" series by Aleatha Romig.
0,Fun, funny, cute movie
0,The plot in this book to me is slipping and too many plot twists are added.
0,I really love this series so far. The characters are believable and colorful. I love the romance and especially when they end, I don't feel that the book leaves me hanging. Every book is its own story.	I'm sure I will be reading all of them.
0,I was given this book in exchange for an honest review. This is the second book in the series, it's not a stand alone you need to start with part one. Waiting for part three. Amazing work Lynn.
0,This is nice book on Investing. This book gives the information which things you required to know before investing. This book contains different elements of stock market and its components. This will not only help to increase your money but also help you to secure your financial future. There are also some tips to consider before start investing.
0,4.5 out of 5 Stars	Between Two Realms by Amber Flora		  The Novel Between Two Realms is the first book in the Series by Amber Flora. This Novel blew me away. It was funny, engrossing and filled with adventure and of course romance! Amber Flora brings such life to her characters. All of the characters have strong personalities, entertaining and mysterious. Flora wove a tale that ensnared me from the start. There was no putting this book down once I started. Amber Flora created a new reality for me as she drew me into this unforgettable story. 		 Ashtyn Lane is tender hearted, sassy and gives new meaning to being strong willed. For the last 28 years, she has lived a quite life living on her late-Uncles farm. With out a family, and lost in life-like dreams and daydreams, Ashtyn never really felt like she fit in with those around her. 		     A chance meeting one day with familiar guy (Cody) on the street starts a series of cataclysmic events that forever changes Ashtlyn life. Cody is a sexy, bossy Dreamwalker from another realm sent to protect Ashtlyn by sharing her dreams. She soon discovers that she is part Dreamwalker, a being who can realm jump. As if that wasn't enough, she also learns that her mother, the High Priestess, foresaw Ashtyn being the prophesied Phoenix. As such she would unite the 4 realms, Vampire, Wizard, dream walker and human and restore Avonya (a safe haven for dream walkers) to its former glory. . you would be our salvation, from the ashes a phoenix will rise and restore Avonya to all its glory.  She is the key the enemies seek. Unfortunately for Ashtlyn, she has no idea why!		 Enlisting the help Mac, Codys best friend and fellow Dreamwalker, Ashtyn sets out to find out the answers that she seeks. Traveling to new realms for answers and trying to evade the numerous rebels after her she makes many new friends that aid her in her journey. Along the way the connection she feels for both Cody and Mac intensifies. As if the fate of the world in Ashtlyn hands was not enough, she now has too try and decipher her feelings for sexy Cody and ladies man Mac! It defiantly makes their journey exciting!		 This story is told in a three person point of view- Ashtyn, Cody and Mac. Between two Realms is the first of a series, I am hoping there will eventually be a HEA and there IS A CLIFFHANGER!! Having said that so worth the read and highly recommended. Personally I will be following this author from now on.
0,A Hispanic ballet dancer that was a former gang member? Very original plot and exciting! I loved it and can't wait to read number 2 to see what happens!
0,This book had flawed characters, undeniable chemistry, and just enough twists and turns to keep me reading. I'd recommend this to anyone who loves a good bad boy. Even better, this one has an accent and speaks French. Does it even get better than that? (;
0,Now, some might consider me biased in this review, but honestly, having ANYTHING to do with this book was such an honor.  I'd met L. Leander online, just chatting about author stuff, and I agreed to read and review her first book, INZARED: Queen of the Elephant Riders.  From page one, I was hooked, and when I finished the book, I was terrified that there wouldn't be a second.		So when I got the email stating that book two was in the works, nearly finished, in fact, I couldn't wait to get my grubby hands on it.  The moment I opened up the book, I was hooked.  It starts soon after book one leaves off, and takes the reader on a journey, tying up loose ends that book one left, with Inzared's family, both circus and biological.  It takes her back to her home, this time with her son, and shows the raw emotion as she connects with the people she grew up with and mourns the loss of her husband.		I won't give anymore plot spoilers away, because honestly the book is worth reading to find out for yourself.  Inzared is such a rich character, and tugs at your heartstrings every turn of the page.  New characters are introduced, one in particular that piqued my interest and I can't wait to see if he makes it to book three.  God I hope so.  Pretty please?  With sugar on top!		The book has a unique prose, Inzared having retained a lot of her Appalachian dialect, but you can see as the book goes on, just how changed she was by the circus, and for the better, in my (not so) humble opinion.  I'm definitely excited to see if a book three is in the works (again, pretty please!?) and this book gets a very well deserved five of five stars.  This is a series I plan to keep up with til the very end, and I think, if you give it a chance, you'll agree with me.
0,Very interesting and a good read didn't want to put it down till I read the complete book.
0,There's nothing I enjoy more than a well-written story about Navy SEALS and this set certainly fills the bill. Each story is fast-paced and jam-packed with plenty of action and hot love scenes. I'll be looking for more books by this talented author!
0,This books is set in both the modern world and in the other world: which is cut in half by the river An. One side is the land Andar, the other side is the land of the "Undain" Angere.		Part of the story is told by two of the witches of Andar, Hellen and Fer. Their world intrigued me, it lured me in, it was like I walk right back into Middle-Earth or Alagaesia. Worlds I miss and haven't visited in a while. Fer, Ran and Johnny Electric set out for this world, Cait's world, but their travel is not without many obstacles. With them also traveled another interesting companion, an Archaeon, a bookworm, he made quiet an interesting character, he reminded me of another riddle speaking creature but I am not sure from which world. The fight agains evil has started and it is a wild ride, exciting, interesting and lovely.		This book is action-packed from beginning until the end, without a pause to breath. I devoured this book and I am very glad that I have signed up for the book tour!		If you love stories like those of the masters of Fantasy, you might also like this one, even though this world is not as complex as that of for example Alagaesia, but it has a lot of similar elements in it. I can tell you that if you like urban and epic fantasy you will surely love to read this.		Full Reviews here:	Dutch:[...]	English: [...]
0,Dani Pettrey's "Alaskan Courage" series is one of my favorite in-progress series, and Stranded continues the high-octane suspense and romance from the previous two books. Gage and Darcy, whose attraction in Shattered was undeniable, are the central romance in Stranded. Watching them fight their attraction and then finally acknowledge it is so much fun. Also, the mysterious Jake Westin's past is finally revealed to everyone, setting up his romance with Kayden McKenna in book four.		As for the mystery, it's a good one. As Darcy and Gage get closer to the truth of what happened to the women who vanished from the cruise ship, the stakes become higher and higher, and the ultimate reveal? Well, let's just say I'm going to be hesitant to ever take a cruise!		I really enjoyed Strandedit's a great continuation of a fantastic series. 4-1/2 stars
0,I love Jacob and Layla's story. Finally something great happens for them and I couldn't be happier. I am so glad the author decided to right more about this couple. Then there's Rachel another evil in Jacob and Layla life. This is a must read.
0,I usually read science fiction, the harder, the better. I enjoy the hows being explained to me in fact and detail. I usually do not care for unexplained magic in a story. This story was different.	The Author emailed me to let me know that this book was in a free day, and asking me to review it. I am glad I did. The book was clear of grammatical errors, easy to read, and interesting enough to make a hard sci-fi guy keep reading until the end. He claimed that this book was in the same genre as AMERICAN GODS. I disagree. It builds a better world than that, so I would say that it is more like THE SILMARILLIAN. He built a wonderful world of ancient powers and honorable humanity, with impressive bad guys in the mix.	Try the book. I think you will like it. The only real problem I saw was a lack of a paperback format of the book.
0,This is a good spin off, I like how the author told us readers what happened in the past and that shows us how the characters got to where they are in the present. This book had all the drama and I couldn't put it down. However this book did have a few errors that should have been corrected but overall good read
0,The Remedy is an ultimately exciting sequel to The Ryn, continuing the epic tradition of its predecessor and leaving just enough tantalizing hints about the future of certain secondary characters to leave the reader eager for more of the "Eyes of E'veria" series!		The beginning was a little rough for me in comparison to the great beginning of The Ryn. The pacing starts out sort of slow, and there's quite a bit of recapping from the first book. (That might be more helpful to those who haven't read The Ryn, however. It just kept me from really being drawn into the flow of the story for a while.) After all the foreshadowing and planning in The Ryn, I guess I was just eager for the actual journey to get started. *wink*		The plot really picks up close to halfway through the book, and from then on it's a thrilling, harrowing, surprising adventure as Rynnaia and her faithful companions seek the Remedy for the sake of the kingdom and all those they love. Lots of unexpected twists and lessons in humility along the way! The characters are spared very little of the danger and suffering such an undertaking entails. But the ending is completely satisfying and extra special for those who have read both parts of the story.		It's a pleasure to rejoin this great cast of characters, and I'm looking forward to seeing where Chase takes some of them in future novels. Chase offers a great "remedy" in this series for bookshelves deficient in a sweet mix of fairy tales and fantasy (with some romance, of course!).		*With thanks to the author for providing me with an ARC e-version of the book in exchange for my honest opinion.*
0,Right now there are a crapton of MC books floating around the market, and for the most part they are complete crap. This book is mostly realistic, though not entirely, and it's hot. I loved the characters in this book, and I can't wait to hear what happens with Faith and Jules. Not only did the author tell a great story, but she set up the story in an authentic way, which paved the way for future books.
0,Hot! Hot! Hot! What can I say! Claudia M Farwell did it "Hot!" when she authored Lover's Purr. I can't get enough of a hot shifter, and Wow! this book hits all the right buttons for me! Jace sounds like the perfect type of shifter: sweet, kind, and fiercely protective! This MUST READ book really hooks you deep, you can't put this book down! If you are looking for a great read, grab this one today!
0,I have received this book in exchange for an honest review.  This does not affect my opinion of this book or the content of my review.		Honestly, click the "buy" button on this one.  You will NOT be sorry you did.  This is an AWESOME book.		Lee is the arrogant MMA fighter, former military man, and now stepbrother.  He is also the ass that in high school stood Raina up for the prom only to take more than his fair share of her later that night.  Then to run away from facing the truth of what happened he enlists and leaves for the military.  Not once forgetting Raina, never, but also not once thinking of her instead of himself.  Definitely a selfish arrogant ass, but he has a side that he is not wanting to admit to.....he does care for her.		Raina is the girl he stood up for the prom making her feel horrible, but he still isn't going to allow her to get away from him in high school without being with her, and he was.  She is ashamed that she didn't have more self control, and add to that the being stood up - it is the perfect storm of teenage girl angst.  She still blames herself for allowing Lee into her life, and even more she blames herself for allowing the thought that he CARED for her enter her mind and heart.  He hurt her.  Badly.  Who would have known that he is now "family."		A few years later she is distant from her mom, lots of things bring this on, and yet she doesn't always like that feeling.  So her mom calls her and tells her she has news, invites her to dinner.  Raina not wanting to be a bad person accepts and goes over.  Mom breaks the news she is married.....yep to Lee's father.  Then she sees Lee.  All the emotional baggage from their first round surfaces.  (It is always there but now it is at the surface instead of buried a little.)  Lee recognizes her and all instincts of "Mine" kick in once again.  He never forgot about her.  They both have changed.  Some good changes (his muscles, he is better looking with age, he is an MMA fighter now) some not so good (she just broke up with a mob boss who is not willing to let her go, and she doesn't know what to do.  She is still thinking of Lee and what they did in high school and how he made her feel then and now...but her days are basically numbered)		Lee is also running from the same mob boss, he didn't "lose" the fight he was supposed to, took the money and left.  Not the way the game goes....you do what the boss says and you are good.  That is totally against what Lee will do.  Together they have sparks.  He starts in with her at the dinner table, and when it is time to leave he stalks her and gets his way.....again.  Only this time he is smitten, he is hooked and really doesn't know why or how it happened, he also isn't sure he likes it.  Chemistry is on their side and she takes just as much as she gives, and she knows she never got over him, even slightly.		There are some twists in this story that leaves you on the edge of your seat, and wanting more all at once.  There is running from the mob together, parents going through the situation and not knowing what is going on.  Does Lee allow himself to feel for Raina?  Does she risk her life for him?  Who comes out the winner in the end?  Is there help with winning?  Do they really get free from the hold the "boss" has over them once and for all?  Do they have a happy ever after?  Again, click the "buy" button and read this book.  You will NOT be sorry.  It will have you wanting more too.
0,This is the beginning of a fun cute series.  The premise of arranged marriages has stood the test of time.  The chemistry works.
0,I love this series and the wolves of stone ridge series. I can't wait until there is another one. I'm always re reading the series and always catch something I didn't notice before.
0,When I started this book, I wasn't sure what to expect. Usually incest books center around the relationship and have very little plot outside of that angle -- and let's face it, the ones I ordinarily read are a lot darker. Let Your Heart Decide, though, was a really neat story that centered around a ghost story with a forbidden romance taking equal time. The fact that it happened to be between brothers was an interesting angle. It's treated a lot more lightly than I'd have thought, and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes sweet romance stories with the incest as only a minor footnote.
0,The simplest way I can sum up this story is that the blurb piqued my curiosity, the story grabbed hold and hung on for dear life, and the ending threw me for a loop.		I found the idea of a cupcake bodyguard assignment for a spoiled rich kid intriguing.  The name your price gauntlet that was thrown down as part of the vetting process to hire Micah just served to further amp up my whats up radar.  I was wholly unprepared for the enigma that was Kit/Christopher.		As characters go, Kit is as damaged and interesting as they get.  He was traumatized as a young boy by witnessing the multiple murders of those closest to him, then kidnapped and escaped.  As an adult, Kit suffers from the psychological effects of that trauma  the loss of his voice, having almost no sexual identity and homebound due to severe agoraphobia.  My initial impression of Kit was that he was either completely psychotic or a total ass; however, once the POV switched to Kits and I had a chance to really get to know him, he got under my skin and I fell in love.		Micah was also damaged goods and came with his own baggage.  I enjoyed his hints of snarky attitude and total vulnerability when it came to Kit; however, as bodyguards go, I think Id have to pass on recommending him.  I get that he was distracted by Kits beauty and their connection, but he acted more like a guest hanging out than someone doing a job.		The majority of the story revolves around a past that seems to have come back to haunt Kit, and trying to solve the mystery before things escalate out of control.  I rode this wave of adrenaline as events unfolded and couldn't put the book down.  Ultimately, as all the puzzle pieces are fit into place, the story took some twists and turns that were completely unexpected, somewhat convoluted, and frankly more than a little confusing at times (*scratches head and mutters what???*).  5 hearts/stars became 4.		Despite the crazy ending, this author can tell a crazy good story and this book is well worth the read.  Those who like lots of drama, intrigue, and romance are sure to love it  just be prepared to relegate the crazy family stuff to the sidelines!
0,New worlds, new galaxies, new planets and with them, their own sets of laws and rules and their own rulers. However, nothing compares to the the one thing that threatens everyone  the ever-present threat of terrorism. Humans against Cybers  humans working with Cybers. Who does one trust in order to get to the truth and stop terrorism once and for all? Sons of Abraham is imaginative and thought-provoking and while a great deal of thought by the author has gone into creating the alternate worlds about which he writes, Ray nevertheless remembers to incorporate tangible references to a world the reader is familiar with in order to keep the sci-fi grounded and more believable  even when it seems that all is about to be lost.  The Sons of Abraham is an ambitious undertaking; one that requires a thorough edit to tighten the story and to correct typographical errors. References to mythology were a nice touch and despite the considerable length of the combined volumes, the author does a good job, for the most part, in maintaining the sense of momentum in order to keep the reader engaged and eager to see how the conflict resolves itself and who will come out victorious in the end.
0,This was not my first go around with the books.  I just never read them all in one shot.  My original opinion stands.  I loved how the story intertwines the characters and stories of Norse myths into a modern day story.  The story progresses quite nicely from beginning to end.  It is fulfilling to have a complete story with no loose ends.  I also like that there could be more but this arc is finished.  The characters are fun and likable.  The romance is not in your face and I like it.  There is a gentlemanly quality to Ull that is refreshing.  For some reason the story will have you craving waffles, cookies, winter, and snow.  Maybe even dream of Norse gods, blonde, strong, blue eyes (fanning self).  All I can say is this was well worth it the first time and still worth it the second time.
0,Loved this book. I also loved this series. The guys started to love and care for each other. They accepted the differences and loved each other for them. I can not wait for the next book. Erin
0,Marley so wants to avoid her past.  But does her past want to let her go?  The heat that comes off this page while reading this book is over the top. Dominate men oh so check.  A must read. Many twists and turns
0,Love this book everyone needs to read this. If you got curves you need to read this book you well love it.
0,Una novela que mezcla historia y entretencin. Fcil de leer y muy entretenida!!!
0,I found this story to be quite interesting and entertaining. The first half was a little slow moving for my impatient brain, but the second half more than made up for that. That's not even a bad thing. I'm just saying if you find yourself looking for action, wait for it, it's worth it.		It had a strong finish that I liked very much, and will really enjoy seeing where the story goes from here.		The narration of a book is often something that I find very interesting, and can often make or break a story for me, and in this case, while there were little things about the narration that I didn't quite get, overall, the author used a very unique point of view, and an interesting mechanism to tell this story, and I did very much enjoy that.		To elaborate on what I really liked about the narration, let me ramble on for a moment. I thought that the method used in telling The Princess Bride was very interesting and unique, in how it allowed the author to skip parts of the story and just give a brief recap on some things that transpired. I thought that was brilliant, and really only worked with the method the author used in telling that story. It was a bit over used, but it was unique and enriched the story.		Nick Cole also has a unique talent for narration, as evident in The Old Man And The Wasteland, as well as The Savage Boy. He shared the thoughts of lions in one scene, and I thought that was a unique and brilliant method of story telling. Where am I going with this?		I felt that Chad Huskins style of narration for this story, and the point of view it's told from, sort of blends both of the aforementioned styles. Allowing for smooth transition from scene to scene, as well as providing characters thoughts and insight through a unique method.		I'm rambling on here, but narration is such an important part of telling a story, and I felt that, even if I took issue with it in some places, this narration was very very good.		Back to the actual story.		The characters, few as there were, were very interesting. The Cerebs, to me, as vastly different as they were, right down to their core, reminded me very much of humans, oddly. Maybe it's their cold ability to wipe out anything they see as a possible threat, with cold calculation, and a "them or us" mentality that cost humanity everything.		I can't wait to read the next one.		I also really liked the authors notes at the end. I wish more authors would give some incite into things like what inspired their story, or like in this case, interesting thoughts on the advanced technology used.
0,well written...good story line...and very believable. Interesting characters and knowledge of sailing complete this novel. it will make you think about what you see going on in the world and make you more aware in A world filled with terrorists.
0,Colin was drawn to Joey from the first moment he saw her. Unfortunately, with his upcoming deployment, he knows that starting any kind of relationship isn't the best idea at the moment. So he walks away. Though he regretted it, he never thought hed have the chance to see her again. Until he did.		Just Once wasn't what I was expecting after reading the synopsis but by no means is that a bad thing. Its heartfelt and engaging. You could feel the connection between Colin and Joey instantly. I loved how their story progressed. The pace was perfect. More so, I loved how Joey didn't give up on Colin in his darker moments even though she had every right to. It was admirable how she and the supporting characters stood up for him when they could have easily walked away. My heart truly hurt for Colin and what he was going through. The way he was finally able to open his eyes and admit that he needed help even though he knew it would show vulnerability was commendable. I truly enjoyed this book.
0,First time reading this author and I'm going to check out her other books. This was a fun and sexy romance, with characters I enjoyed following to a HEA.  Looking forward to the next. JudyE
0,Fine job, Stephen. The next iteration appears to entice our imaginations as Humanity reaches for its place throughout the Universe.
0,I can't believe how much I love this side of the story! It's nice to see most of the players but also nice to see new ones! Dean please hurry and finish up this universe! I am dying to see what happens! Lol
0,Love this book and the recipes for natural medicine! Antibiotics are prescribed too easily in my opinion and destroying our bodies.. Thanks Megan!
0,This Sarah Woods book is a little different than some of her other ones.  I loved it. This week it was exactly what I needed to read. I had just finished a very intense book and reading this one that was just exciting enough to keep you reading, but light enough not to bough you down.
0,The Spore has reduced most of humanity to little more than barbarians, then a child ventures beyond her city's walls to find Enti whom she believes can save her terminally ill mother. She encounters a being who gives her a gift that changes her life forever. She ends up locked in a tower and tortured while priests try to determine the meaning of the being's message. Years later she sets out with these priests to the dead continent to find 'Ark'. She ends up separated from them as the priests fight a war and she goes on to find Ark. A surprise ending will throw you for a loop and have you anxiously looking for the next book in the series.		In this society men see themselves above women, treating them as little valued brood mares. I am not sure I liked that any more than our heroine did. The characters are well developed, so you get to know them pretty well. You also get to know many of the side characters and their enjoyable side stories. Overall, this story moved along nicely and I look forward to the sequel and finding out what happens next.
0,Do you think I'm made of money Marcy Jacks? One great series right after another. With storylines as compelling as each are different. Since I started reading your books my Amazon card has taken a serious hit. My Archived Items has ticked up exponentially. My Carousel is stuffed with Unread Jacks books, my other favorite authors are getting crowded out and they aren't happy :o( .  I like to take breaks in between an author's series, which is the only reason all my reviews aren't just Marcy Jacks books. If you love pregnant male books like me then Marcy is your girl. She is also very good at displaying the courage and fortitude of disabled characters. Which brings us back to the first book in the Of Dragons and Wolves series.	Conner the alpha's youngest son has about five strikes against him. He's really small, with a bad heart, a limp, inability to either hunt for or defend himself, and he's an omega. If he weren't loved by his alpha dad and very strong older brothers he surely would have been banished or culled from the pack. As it stands he is considered the pack runt and useless to many including council members. None of this helps Conner's self esteem or pride. Neither does being the alpha's "baby" boy. He wants to do something to show everyone, especially his family that he can also contribute to the well being of the pack. This led to him sacrificing himself by offering himself as the "alpha's son" required by the dragon leader in exchange for peace between their pack and the dragons clan. Unfortunately neither his family nor the high dragon appreciated / were happy with his sacrifice.	This story was exciting. Just when you thought you knew what was going to happen Ms Jacks throws a curveball. It is an entertaining story as well. From the high dragon's initial reaction to his new mate to flying on your mate's back. There is also drama, intrigue, and jealousy. Who is shooting at the dragons? Who is the other blond in the dragon leader's life? How do the other dragons feel about their clan leader's defective mate? What is the difference between dragon and wolf mating rituals? Why were the dragons and wolves fighting? How long had they been sworn enemies?	What's especially great about this book is that we are introduced to Conner's five older brothers as well as several clan members who served as Conner's bodyguards and the high dragon's soldiers. We can anticipate some very good stories...like the second book in the series which is waiting on my Kindle Fire's Carousel. Happy Reading!
0,I could not put Hunger down, the story keeps you connected to the subjects of the story. Well written and so very good. Cannot wait to start the next in this series. Brianna and Yolen need to get their act together and become one. She is his Blood Rose and can help him to become a better fighter for the good.  He tries to stay away from Brianna to keep her safe, but he is breaking her heart and causing her more pain. They need to bond to make things right.
0,I read the first few pages of this book and then put it down.  The story didn't grab my attention.  Nevertheless I did continue reading and the story slowly dragged me in.  So much so that I bought the next novel in the series as soon as I finished this one.	I found the storyline overly complicated at the beginning as there are so many characters.  However, by the time I was half way through I saw that all the lines of the story were coming together and the ending was satisfactory.	I loved the strong female characters and the unexpected humour.
0,Good read.  Good writer too.  I am into some of his other stories now.
0,This was just what the doctor ordered. A sweet boy meets boy story without too much angst.  Yes there was a bump in the road. That is to be expected in the m/m genre.  But no one got gay bashed. Both young men have supportive parents and great friends. They have a great whirlwind romance and live happily ever after.  Well written with likable characters throughout.  Summer's not over so it isn't too late for this to be a great beach read. It would also make a good commuter train read since much of the action takes place on a commuter train.  Let yourself relax into this one and enjoy.
0,A really well written easy read.	Also a good length, enough room for a sweet story.	I received a copy in exchange for a review.
0,Jade is an awesome writer. Each book was so good and full of action and excitement. I would recommend this book to everyone to read. What I would like to know is why the last book was almost $10? That was a lot for the last book.
0,Just finished this one and I loved it. Becca and Scotts story is awesome and I can't wait to read Olivia and April's story, they are great I just know I'm going to love them
0,This book has a little bit of everything. At times for corky, at times funny and hot, but also heartbreaking.
0,3.5 stars		A quick and enjoyable story.		I enjoyed the chapters going back into the past.		I loved that they were together in college		River is cool and sassy		Kane is cleaver and ambitious and a little closed off		As a couple they have complete sexual chemistry with a touch of sweetness.		The sexy scenes are hot		All up a good story, and I will be on the look out for the authors future works
0,Me encanto! Una historia diferente, contada en un lenguaje muy nuestro. Alto voltaje, escenas que levantan la temperatura y a su vez mucha ternura. Imperdible!
0,Great read,! Decent plot that hangs togeather  Action and characters	To match.  It's a fast read with lots of twists to make it interesting.
0,I received a copy of this ARC from the author in exchange for an honest review.		Loved it!!!  This was a little different than her usual books but it was fantastic.  Loved the story. Nobody writes bad boys like BB Hamel.
0,My favorite of the series to date! Mandy's Story is fun, funny, exciting, very unpredictable, romantic and sexy. A great read for any fans of the genre to enjoy! A 4.5 rounded to a solid 5 rating.		Honey is one grumpy bear. Albeit a handsome, kind and loving grumpy bear. He has no time for games, pranks or little girls and lets it be known. But when one young and beautiful little wolf gets the best of him. He just might stick around to play a game or three ;)		Mandy is just shy of being of age for mating. She's known who her mate is for a long time and grows more and more impatient to claim him as hers. So much so she devises a wicked plot to corner him and convince him she is his mate. But will her plan backfire and will she never know the love and bond of a true mate?		I've followed this series from book 1 and have enjoyed each one of them. D'Elen has written each one so they can be read as stand-alone reads. But I recommend reading each one of them. Each is original in its own way, each touches you in its own way and each is so worth the time spent reading :)
0,Penny a Teacher goes to Solkovia to help out and teach the children English. She is with a church group. She is running away from her past to forget her losses. Everything is going good. She stubbles across some shady things. People are not who they seem to be.	Krisstoff is the Prince of Kosztyla. He saves Penny and he has decided he wants Penny to marry him and be his Princess. She is his prisoner but can she really fall in love with him..	It was a great love story two broken souls finding love through seeming like the worst circumstances. There is quiet a few twists and turns along the way that keeps you wanting to turn the pages. Another wonderful book by Abigail.	5 Star read
0,Fascinating true story of ,England's most prolific serial murderer ,Dr. Harold Shipman. He was not a shadowy figure who crept around in the dark,hunting victims. No; he had access to his victims because he came off as a caring physician. Therefore he was certainly a monster.	The book is very well-written,and was well researched .
0,Overall part 2 was well worth the wait...	It varies with different emotions and unfortunately some stories do not end the way you like...	It is all about true love, loyalty and most important friendship...
0,I loved this story
0,The 4 stars are because I felt it a bit long without adding information. At least for me. But the story was good & kept my interest. I do recommend it to others. I think this book would be good for a book club discussion.
0,Good sequel, love the strength shown by the female characters.
0,I was worried about reading this third book in the Hotel Rodeo series since I really didn't care for Delaney in the prior two books. Happily this book really turned my feelings for her around. While I still think she's a bit of a brat, her behavior is a bit more understandable now. What she wants more than anything is a baby. Husband, no thank you! Since Ty turned down her request for his help in this matter she's left looking for someone else to be the donor. When Zac McDaniel, Ty's long time friend, starts working the ranch next door Delaney sees it as an opportunity to good to pass up. Problem is Zac has had it bad for Delaney since the day he and Ty first met her but he was to slow making his move. He's not sure he wants to be her second choice but if he does agree he plans on doing it the old fashioned way!
0,Another great book from this author, can't wait to read the next book Because I loved this one. A must read!
0,Wilson's and Max's story was absolutely powerful and exciting with so much passion. I loved how the characters and story line was written, just WOW! What more can you say about this book and series, but just WOW, Beautiful, emotional, rollercoaster ride the time of your life just by reading this book and series. Thanks for writing an amazing book and series. I enjoyed reading this book every much. Thanks again!
0,This is a story of a twenty-four-year-old gal, Phoebe Hawley, who is an out-of-work-mill girl looking for work and lands in Bayou La Batre, Alabama, with her five-year-old asthmatic brother and twelve-year-old sister in tow. She ends up tangling with the owner of a junkyard in the fishing village who has a small daughter. He also has her bumper to her old rusty truck when she backs into him and can't get it back until she pays him $70 to get his vehicle fixed. This is a quick, funny read that will keep you hooked until the end. The witty dialogue between the main character Gage and Phoebe drives the entire story. You can't help but laugh through this one.
0,The  author did a great job with the storyline .  The books had  my emotions all over the place. You couldn't help but feel the main characters pain and suffering.  I did shed tears. This was the first time I read this authors work.		CindyCarr1@live.com
0,This is a fast moving action packed stories of Beatrice Rose transgressions in Hong Kong while hiding from the Company. I would recommend these books to anyone who enjoys a good action story.
0,Jody's characters are funny and witty, her bedroom scenes hot (as in firehouse hot!) and the chemistry between these two is like static on a dry day. Oh, and the book cover is lovely, too! ;-)
0,Such a lovely story, the characters are well done and the way they come together and complement on another is great. I read this last month and I'm sorry I didn't post my review then. I am a big Lydia fan just love her romances.
0,I pride myself on being an avid reader, not to mention having varied tastes - tastes that have changed and developed over the years. I have been blessed to have enjoyed the works of a large group of diverse authors, and like most readers I have my favorites.		As time goes by, my pantheon of favorite authors changes. It expands, and sometimes contracts, but even after nearly five decades of reading enjoyment I can easily count my true favorites on the fingers of two hands.		This is the second book by Karin Bishop that I have read, and with this lovely book she has earned herself a spot amongst the stars. Karin, if you perchance read this review, please know that this story touched me in ways that only a handful of others have. Even as I sit and type this review I am still overcome with emotion by this story. Your work is unbelievable - your characters full and lifelike, so much so that I easily lost myself amongst them for hours at a time. The plot and how the story flows and develops are so natural as to suck the reader in. I truly felt that I wasn't reading the story so much as living it. I felt Katie's pains and triumphs - if I am completely honest with myself, I am still sitting here hugging myself wanting to be her so badly it hurts. Miss Bishop, you have honestly achieved an astounding thing with this story - you have me crying that I am not Katie.		Thank you Karin, from the bottom of my heart for making me feel this way.		I can honestly say that there is only one thing wrong with this book - and that is that like all stories it must come to an end.		I would recommend, no I would beg everyone to take the time to read this truly wonderful work by Karin Bishop.
0,I know this is book number seven. I like the way Mr McFarland works the characters behind the main plot and tied them all together. Looking forward to see how these. show up later on.
0,That was one hell of an Hall Pass	Shoot......that's how its supposed to be	These days u gotta be 10 different women	That's what makeup, wigs, and stuff is for.	Time for me to learn a few languages
0,This is a great ebook everyone should have on hand.  As one who battles immune issues and prone to fighting stuff regularly, I will be using some of the techniques outlined in this book.  My preference is to turn to natural remedies first and usually that is effective.
0,This book was so good I'm so glad Tan finally got her happily ever after she deserved it. This series was one of the best I have read
0,I Have both versions	Overall 5	Performance 5	Story 5	Loved this book listened to it in one go I couldn't stop listening.	I've listened to one other book narrated by Logan McAllister and at the time I didn't care for it, I couldn't figure out why at the time. Now stay with me folks. I now think it was because it was a male voice and it threw me off. This time I enjoyed his reading a lot more. He brought the story to life for me.	The story was hot, fun and different. Maggie Ryan is one of my favorite spanking authors.	I heartily recommend both the book and audible versions	I was voluntarily provided this review copy audiobook at no charge by the author, publisher and/or narrator. This did not impact my review in any way. I bought the ebook.
0,Jack is a NFL quarterback and seems to just keep spiraling down the wrong way. He is a great player but he is just to wild in public. Women all the time and nothing but negative press. The league is ready to kick him out when he informs then he is in a committed relationship. He tells them it's his publicist Leah. Leah is put on the spot in front of everyone and confirms the relationship. Buy this book and take this ride with Jack and Leah, I think you will love it.
0,Can't wait for the next instalment, great characters, interesting local. A brave new world has been created just for us. Plenty of action, great reversal of perceived male-female roles.
0,I love the character development. The way the author describes the people/shifters in the book makes you feel like you know them and care about them. You want to continue reading just to see what's going to happen next. I highly recommend this book, if you enjoy paranormal romance.
0,This is the best story about young people lives and the choices they make.  This one is about duty during service and the fallout after.  The way a young girl thinks she in love with one and then hurts him with another only to find out she didn't love either one.
0,Once Upon a Witch: This was a cute story about a 'haunted house' and the people living in it.  Although there wasn't actually any spanking involved this was a surefire way to ensure a spanking. Would love to see more!		Mistress Mine: Halloween at the castle you know things are gonna get steamy. Mistress is always in charge of Ana and her pleasures. This is packed with spanking goodness and I can't wait to see more of Miranda and Ana.		Phoenix Spanked: Aw! What a sweet and heartwarming story. Imagine being a Phoenix and actually catching on fire and being reborn over and over again. Imagine doing it alone. Well in this story true love shines bright over the flames and ashes. Sometimes all you need is a good spanking to make you believe that love will triumph.		Carnival of the Damned: Oh no! This one had such amazing potential.  I'm so sorry to see it ended so soon. Finding your mate on another plane and having only one moment to allow him back to your world... such an amazing idea.  "Love doesn't hesitate"		Missy Sue Revisited: Wow just wow! I would love to see more of Missy and Kevin for sure. The author did a stunning job on the characters and their background.  I could see myself being friends with Missy and causing trouble with her. The Spanking was so real and detailed I felt every hit. It was a sexy sizzling time. This was a beautiful Halloween story about how one couple spiced things up with a friendly witch.  Combined with some spanking and denial this book was perfect.		Under Her Spell: A fun paranormal story that's sure to keep you warm as well as interested and intrigued as sparks fly in this lovely story.		The Elder Warlock: Hot damn. That's a naughty story. This story shows there is a difference between a naughty witch and a bad witch... and oh its heats up when she is a naughty witch with the naughtiest witch of them all. I could totally see this being turned into a full length novel to continue the adventures.  I hope it's continued!		Snowbound: So it looks like this one will not be continued and that is truly awful. This was such a fun interesting adventure filled story. It sure did steam up too...right before the author closed the door. Wish this story had more!		The Spanking Connection:  "Does the bad witch need a spanking?" Well everyone should have a good spanking even if they are a bad witch. This was a sexy short story about two people reconnecting with each other and nature and boy does it get hot.		Simon: This story puts a naughty twist on Simon says ;) locked up for a long time watching people not pay for things well its time for some punishments. The first thing that happens is a well earned spanking and it sure steams up!		Bear to Her: Mmm when you're expecting to find a bear and it turns out to be a beautiful woman what would you do? Well the tables are turned when the woman turns out to be a powerful shifter. Spankings are in order as this story becomes hotter than bear fur.		After Ana: This was such an unbelievably sweet and loving story. Ana and Miranda get along perfectly and they really are good for each other. Sometimes the one in charge just needs to let the other in and allow the love to help. I can't wait to read the full story once it's released.		 A Witchy Good Time: This was a fun beautiful story about finding love in the least expected place. I can't spoil it but the ending is a spanking good time.		Charity Benshaw's Enchanted Paddle Emporium: Wow! What a fun concept. A witch being able to do a spells and make paddles in an instant.  This is a super short piece of what I'm sure will be a spontaneously hot and awesome story.		The Special Ingredient: This story has enough potential to be a full novel just as it is. We get just enough of a sneak peek to keep it interesting. When you're a witch and a baker at the same time what would you do? I'll admit I would totally put a special ingredient in my cookies too... especially when the punishment involves a spanking. This was a cute little story that I hope to see continued.		 All's Well That Ends Well: wooo that was quite an adventure.  When you're having a bad day trust your friend to make it better for you even if they make it a bit worse by teasing on the way. A fun story.
0,Wow... I love Courtney's character!  I also have a man who was a virgin....Love knowing he gave his special gift to me! Best of all...He loves  her Anna!!!
0,5 stars allll day long this book is the bomb.com absolutely loved it and must read..Nice makes the book hilarious with his commentary,  Jah shows real love for his lady, and Los is just a boss who's learning what love is Lucky, Ty, and Keema are the ladies in there lives and u will learn something from each relationship if you ain't read it yet you definitely missin out worth every penny thirsty for part2.
0,Great story of love and sacrifice and second chances. Life brings sorrow, love, challenges.it is how you deal with them that counts
0,Having never heard of the author or her blog before, I bought this cookbook with a gift card after noticing that readers had given it great reviews at Amazon.com. IamNotaVegan, but Im not a big meat eater and I enjoy trying new recipes, especially vegetarian ones. Once it arrived, I went to a couple of different stores in order to track down the ingredients, and tried several recipes. After preparing a few of them, I read through the entire section entitled my natural foods pantry, which provided excellent information about the various ingredients, bought a few more ingredients and prepared a few more recipes. Ive since made the chickpea salad and veggie burger again and plan to continue working my way through those recipes that I think my family (with two teens) might eat. Best of the book: excellent photography, good explanations about vegan ingredients, some really good recipes. My one complaint: Id prefer shed skipped the entire smoothie section and provided additional recipes in the other sections. My specific comments about the recipes I tried are as follows:		glowing strawberry-mango guacamole (good, but nothing I would not or could not have dreamed up on my own)		classic hummus (the one plus was actually making the effort to purchase and use tahini, in the past Id always added sesame oil to peanut butter to make it which is also good)		perfected chickpea salad sandwich (something I would not have tried to do on my own, I really liked this one)		our favorite veggie burger (my favorite recipe, btw, but my hamburger connoisseur son didn't like it and hes liked other veggie burgers)		present glo bar (good)		oil-free chocolate zucchini muffins (I liked this the least, the flavor was nice, but the texture was not great  I like it better with eggs and butter).		In summary, this is a great starter cook book for those who enjoy vegetarian food but beware: the ingredients are not necessarily easy to track down (especially if you live in a smaller city). I have since bought two additional copies, one for a friend, and one so that I could get free shipping that I also plan to gift. Also good: Garlic and Sapphires by Ruth Reichl, The Language of Baklava by Diana Abu-Jaber and Cooking Favourites of the American Legion Auxiliary Wishek, North Dakota.
0,Good book!
0,Since I love listening to country music and  also love sweet romances, I was eager to read Songs that I Whisper. I was not disappointed. The main characters, Suzette and Seth, are both were talented in their own right, she has an artist and he as a country singer. It would have been easy for the author to depict them as cardboard characters, but instead we caught glimpses of their insecurities and the valid reasons behind them.		In Songs that I Whisper, Regina Puckett did a great job showing that talent does not make a person less real than anyone else.
0,With chocolate and love on every page how could I not love this book. Loved all the characters the settings the box of candy.	A great read.
0,As described
0,I did not want to put the book down.  Better understanding of Autism but also of what people go through who have been abused or hurt in the past; and the healing that God can bring.

Waiting patiently for Shayne's story...

0,Beauty and the Cowboy is a sweet story set against the backdrop of the Marietta Fair and Beauty Pageant.

Quickly, the decision is out of her hands because her almost-fianc has gone and married someone else!		Jesse has had feeling for Charlotte since they were kids, now he's helping her nurse her should be-broken heart.  Just when he figures out that she's not that upset, she figures out that this friendship could be more than she ever imagined.		Loved this story and am excited to read more stories set in Marietta!
0,My 50th reunion is next month. And I was a cheerleader also. The book was right on subject matter for me.  I.  GUESS. My favorite character is Buck.  Why a perfect example of friendship with no boundaries.
0,This novel has a good setting and very good descriptions of the scenery and town. I wasn't very pleased with the ending but it was ok.
0,I want to be Liz have two wonderful shifters who loved her.	She would have never met them if she didn't want to kill the man who raped her mother.	She goes to work for him to get close.  She didn't know he was a shifter as she tried to poison him or shoot him but she just could not.  So, she decides to leave work but on her way to her car a van comes out of nowhere and try to kidnap her but she gets way because a tall dark stranger.....to find out more please read this book find out the hot sex she has with Trax & Dante.		If you don't like hot sex this book is not for you.
0,To trust, Isaac was blind at the age of eight in a car accident that took his mother's life. His father drank his self to an early grave. He had one friend his guide dog. Carter outgoing, caring, and loving. The characters are so loving. I enjoyed this book, a must read.
0,I enjoyed all three books in this series. I enjoy reading a good Christian Romance Novel. Will look forward to reading more of her novels.
0,I love reading anthologies.  They give you a sence of newness with each story.  Billy Wells is quite good at keeping you wondering what's next.  You will be happy you checked him out!
0,Zoey lives a regimented, complicated life. But she has no choice. She is trying to work her way through school so she can get a stable life. She is a nanny to a sweet little boy whose mother could be described as the Dragon Lady. One day, her boss's brother shows up at the door and suddenly things are different. Zoey can't deny her attraction but she can't open her heart to someone with everything going on in her life. Besides, she's keeping secrets from her boss and Elliott is a distracting temptation she just can't give in to or she might just lose her job.		The romantic tension between Zoey and Elliot is off the charts from the moment she opens the door. Zoey tries to fight it and Elliott pushes. It was fun to read the back and forth. I read this one almost straight through. It was just that good. When things hit the climax, it was not crazy over-the-top like some books can be. The secrets were handled well and I had a great respect for Zoey.		If you love a sweet, slightly spicy, romance with a side of fun and a tiny dose of reality, you will love this book from K. P. Haigh.
0,If you can believe it, I think I love this book more than the first book. I loved Jets point of view. I cant wait to see how the story continues, onto the third book.
0,Levi Blackthorn is the Alpha bear he served in  the military. There was so much hate from humans and he was dating a human and a group of men beat him so he is not big on dating a human female again. Corey is long time friend and one of the guys on his rescue team has developed a dating app. So Levi decides to give it a try.	Juliet Hernandez  is working for her ex and not very happy at her job . She wants to find a man who loves curves and will treat her right. She puts her add up on the dating site and her perfect match is Levi can he get over his nervousness to meet her at his lodge and can she really go threw with it.	Amazing shifter story would love to give it more then 5 stars .
0,I gave this story 4 stats because I really enjoyed of but with that being said I would have given it 5 even though there were a few editing errors, BUT the cliffhanger although she left us with a HFN ending made me so mad, I  have never read this author but to end it like that with a note to watch out for  the next story that is a big NONO for me. Just warn us a little, I mean I took a huge leap of faith on you, but I will say the story is good, H\h were wonderful together and the was no OW drama or cheating, which is a huge plus. All in all it is a great story, just would have like a little warning on the ending....
0,Wonderful storyline.  With physics being murdered the story has a bit of darkness to it but the love between the characters shines threw.  I can normally pick out who the killer is early on in a book but this one really surprised me .  Great job.
0,I have read two of the stories from this box set and my review of them is as follows:		MELTED BY THE DRAGONS  -  4-STARS	A totally different shifter story, but nonetheless engaging, as there were some interesting scenarios throughout the book.  Because she was fertile, Vivian was cryogenically frozen for over three centuries.  When she wakes up in a land of dragons and has no recollection of her previous life, she finds it difficult to comprehend - more so when she is told she has to produce a child with Jackson, the Commander in charge. Jackson needs an heir and tells Vivian he went back in time,  and purchased her to bear his child, seeing her as committed, bold, confident, fearless and beautiful.  Little did he know then that she was just a coward, trying to flee an abusive relationship.  Vivian makes up her mind she will only have a baby with a man she loves and who loves her;  but Jackson offers her an interesting compromise.

MELTED BY THE LIONS  -  4-STARS	An interesting story which centred mainly around Savannah and her love of animals;  after she is thawed they are her main concern as she regains her memories.

0,Another quick, easy, enjoyable read. Some formatting problems (very minor) and problems with words (steal vs steel, hurtled vs hurdled), but very much improved on all counts editing wise. I disagree with the reviewer that the author is drawing out the overall mystery of what happened to Kate's husband for money, as a sort of scam to keep people reading. I think the abrupt ending, which really should have been longer (she continues to have problems with endings) contributes to this suspicion, but I think it's wrong.		I actually think the missing husband plot connecting all the stories together is one of the most brilliant series devices I've seen in cozies. Instead of being your typically nosy, and therefore sort of rash and even stupid, busybody investigating a crime and possibly obstructing the police for no really unassailable reason--Kate has a very good and justifiable reason for her snoopery. Who's going to blame a woman for doing all she can to find her missing husband, the father of her children? Or at least find out what happened to him. I never feel guilty, as I do in some cozies, in cheering her on when she goes poking around. And even when she gets herself into dangerous situations to find out the truth, it's understandable rather than annoying.		I do think the author is in danger of being too same-y in her set-up, with Kate finding the murdered man in his office as she goes to visit him. It might be time for someone else to find the body. It's not too beliavable that it's always her. Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed another outing with Mrs. Fix-it and her coffee obssession.
0,Francois Bissonnete is a wonderful writer who writes beautifully. He tells his stories in charming ways that capture the attention of children, hold their interest, and fascinate them. His tales are filled with suspense and magic. Many of them are retellings of classical fairy tales with multiple variations that teach children to realize they can use their imagination to change stories.	This book contains two tales with nice pictures. The first is Princess Shazana. A king hears that a princess in another kingdom is beautiful and decides he wants to marry her. He sends one of his subjects, Charles, to persuade her to accept his proposal of marriage. He feels he must do that because the princess has rejected all other proposals. Charles rides to the kingdom of the princess. On the way he has three adventures and saves a fish, an eagle, and an owl. Each animal promises to help Charles in the future.	Charles meets with the princess and she tells him she cannot even think about marriage until she is able to get back her ring that fell into a river a month ago. Then she asks for two other impossible favors. Then she and Charles have to overcome another problem.	Children will enjoy this retelling of a famous story to find out how Charles is able to solve the three problems the princess sets for him and how he and the princess are able to resolve the fourth difficulty.	The second tale is The Three Brothers and the Princess.

0,Yet another well written installment in the Ranger's Apprentice series. We follow Will through another action packed and adventurous portion of his life as an apprentice ranger.
0,** spoiler alert ** This book captivated me from the beginning. I liked the story telling a lot, and I really enjoyed that there was a lot of action. Things weren't just falling into place for Heidi, and it kept me interested. I really liked the premise of this book and enjoyed that it didn't feel like a regurgitated dystopian plot. I liked the characters and could really understand Heidi's motives to run away.		I really felt like the author had a great voice. That's the one thing that makes or breaks a story for me. The book had a strong idea that was well executed in the characters, situations, and pacing.		One part of the story I did have a problem with was how Nicholas and Mai immediately attach onto Heidi. At first, I thought it was because they knew she was a girl, but they were spending practically every second they could with her. Wouldn't people be a bit more suspicious? I figured out later that they were the registrants designated to oversee the Culmination participants, which isn't explained very well toward the beginning of the book. However, the book made it feel like Nicholas and Mai were exclusive to being Heidi's mentors, although I know that wasn't actually the case, so that aspect felt off to me. I wondered a lot about the other Culmination participants, but clearly Nicholas and Mai weren't around them often because they're constantly attending to Heidi. When you do meet some of the participants before the second round, none of them say anything about Heidi/Joseph getting special treatment. Wouldn't they have noticed? That whole relationship felt really weird to me.		It really made me mad when there was a formatting problem at the end of chapter 17 in the epub version. All of a sudden, it skipped ahead to chapter 18 in the middle of a sentence, and I missed 10 pages. Then there was this new character there I'd never met before. I just hope that doesn't appear in all the versions, but it's still not something I can easily forgive in my experience. Edit: Good news! I've been told this has been fixed.		*Alert: Spoilers Ahead. Skip this paragraph if you don't want to see the spoiler.*		While there were definitely some great aspects about this book, I really disliked how the author revealed Mai's secret. There weren't many clues leading up to revealing her as Heidi's mom. If it mentioned her age at all, I totally missed it, and I thought that Mai was pretty young. Maybe that's what prevented me from seeing any other clues about her being Heidi's mom. There was one part when Mai is talking to Nicholas before the third round and says something about a girl. Heidi's like, "She can't be talking about me, can she? I mean, it's not like I'm her daughter or anything." That part felt so out of place because nothing Mai said made it sound like she was talking about a daughter. At the same time, when Heidi says that, you immediately know that she is Mai's daughter even though there isn't much leading up to that conclusion. Later, Heidi's like, "I already ruled out that Mai is my mother," yet there's nothing in the narration that talks about Heidi considering whether or not Mai might be her mother. I think it was great that Mai was Heidi's mom, but I felt cheated out of that story line. It felt awkward, like the author came up with it at the very end to explain what happened to Heidi's mom.		When all is said and done, I enjoyed the storytelling and idea. I thought the pacing and the description were well done, too. I really liked where the book ended. It ties up pretty much everything, but it also leaves room for Heidi and Nicholas to start a revolution. In the end, this book has a lot of good qualities, and I would recommend it to dystopian fans.		I received a free copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.
0,I got this book for free. I really enjoyed the story and will go as far to say that I will read a Jessie Evans book again.
0,Nicolaos is a private investigator in ancient Athens. One day a young man named Herodotus arrives at his door wishing to hire Nicolaos. Herodotus wished to have a personal escort for a trip to Egypt. Diotima, Nicolaos wife was quite eager to join him on this trip. One problem though, Egypt was at war with the Persians. On the plus side Athenians were allied with Egypt. Herodotus himself was from Halicarnassus which was a client state of the Persian Empire so he felt they would have safe passage.  Herodotus plan was to write a book and wanted to travel. Nicolaos knew there was more to this. He went to see Pericles who had recommended Herodotus see Nicolaos. There was more to it. Inaros, a Libyan prince who claims to be a descendant of the last Pharaoh wants to hire Nicolaos on a private matter. Well this was going to be quite an adventure. Nothing goes smoothly though. On the way to Egypt they were overtaken by pirates  but managed to escape that and continue.	This book is nonstop action with the wry humor of Nicolaos and I totally enjoyed it.  This book is a delight to read and I will be buying more of Gary Corby's books.
0,This was a crazy read, just what I expected from this author. Overall I enjoyed this read and would have given it five stars but the editing was so bad I had to reread parts over just to understand what was being said. I can`t wait to read part two, I hope the editing improves.
0,Great characters and the story keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way through.  Looking forward to the next one
0,This was truly an emotional rollercoaster. Seeing the emotional and mental toll another can have on a person was an  eye opener.
0,I thought Morgan and Zoe story was breathtaking but after reading Damian and Maddie....he'll those guys are schoolmates for life.....more please
0,This guide is great! The charts are so helpful that I will be going back to this day after day to pull out the detailed information again.  This is a must read for anyone starting out in this type of trading!
0,Darker than his other books for sure, it made me analyze the fragility of that line between morality and the need to survive (imprisonment)	More than a love story, this book is about loss and hope. The main characters aren't precisely likable and they both do questionable and deplorable things, but those do not make them undeserving of a better, more purposeful life.	I do not care much for flashbacks, I don't consider them necessary but it didn't overpower the story.
0,Only read the first three stories and I think they are funny, different and sometimes appeal emotions because of the characters circumstances.	There was hot sex, a lot of hot sex, a good dose of insecurities but also love and caring for others.	The stories are about a shifters town residents, how they found love and their hilarious behavior. I had a good time with these books. Laughed when visualized the images in my mind, got emotional sometimes with the different situations of the characters relations but mostly enjoyed the books as they are -fictions to relax and enjoy a good time.
0,Another great addition to the Goddess series.  I have to say that so far Lady Shadow is my favorite priestess and how can you not love a pet dragon. I am so looking forward to the next book. Great job and keep them coming.
0,What can I say hasn't been said!  This book had me intrigued from the first sentence.  And it didn't hurt that Ms. Le Carre started off with a quote from one of my favorite songs (Crazy by Gnarls Barkley!).  This delicious morsel tempts us be a captive audience as we meet Lily Hart, a young woman seeking a job as an exotic dancer.  She appears to be goodhearted, friendly, and doing her best to survive in this world.  Enter Jake Eden, the owner of the club Lily is auditioning at.  Needless to say, there are sparks aplenty, and the vibe between them is sizzling.  The story pulled me in, and I read it in one sitting!  I hate reviews that contain spoilers, so I won't go into the shocking surprise at the very end.  Trust me when I say I can't wait for the next "chapter" of this story to see where Ms. Le Carre will take us on this unexpected journey!  This captivating story is a real winner.  Okay Georgia, please don't keep us waiting for the next episode in this great new story!
0,fun read
0,I enjoyed reading this book. But, like some others, I felt the book ended abruptly.  I like series stories, but it left me hanging. I don't mind buying the next book, although it would have been nice to be forewarned.
0,This is a wonderful sweet story of love. There is sadness too but love over rides all. Love Max and his strong personality and his love of horses. Debby is as sweet as can be. You can't help but want to just hug those two kid's. Loved this book and so recommend any and all of Mimi' s books. We all need a little "Mimi time" to brighten our days!
0,A great set of western love books. Cowboys and Indians and farmers and suspense all ending happily ever after. Glad I chose to read them
0,This is an informational piece of writing that lets you know all you need to know in order to successfully follow through with a cleanse and detox geared toward weight loss.		It quickly becomes evident that the author, Lopez, clearly knows what shes speaking about, and her passion for the subject is unmistakable.		We learn the nuts and bolts of detoxification, how and when to detoxify our bodies, various detox short cuts, the numerous health benefits of detoxification, as well as some invaluable information regarding colon, liver, kidney and gallbladder cleanses.		A fantastic resource to have nearby if you are health conscious and aspire to live your life to its fullest, healthiest, and most energetic potential.
0,For a short read (about  hour) this was very well done. There was enough of a story to give context to the love scenes. The love scenes were suitably steamy and the magical twist was given in snippets so as to keep you guessing at the full extent until the end. The characters were developed enough to keep it interesting.		Although this is a part of a series of short stories, they don't seem to be related and can be read independently. I downloaded this when it was free but would be willing to pay $0.99
0,This was such as cute read. I loved it. The hero falls in love with the heroine, but she has many struggles and baggage that keep her from trusting in him. He has upward battle to get her to believe in his intentions.		This book is a quick read and takes place in span of what appears to be weeks. Heroine is trying to flee an arranged marriage. She is half Native American and half white. She is being used as bargaining chip for her tribe, as they are living in a reservation. She tries escape to make better life for herself but is being stalked by an unsavory character that treats her like property. She gets protection at town and she had just met the hero day before when this unsavory character kidnaps her  out in public place. His guy is not willing to give up what he considers property.		I was also upset, right along with the heroine, when hero takes a moment before he reacts. I realize he just met her and needed moment to see what was going on. Realize in that era woman were property and that could also have affected his slow reaction. However, he hears the bad guy has no claim on her and finally he does save her. Then takes her back home and keeps working to try and win her over before he has to leave. He works as ranch hand and passes by towns. He is persistent until finally he wins the heroine's hand. It has a great ending!		I love how he doesn't care about her background and is a real gentleman with her. I love how author describes the rescue and gives us understanding of what each characters internal dialogue is. This is a Christian book, but it doesn't kill you over with scriptures or over the top religious beliefs. It is well written into the story and the author makes it believable how the heroine appears to convert to Christianity. However, the story stays central to the H/h love story and I loved the ending.		I gave it 5 starts because I would read again, and I am open to reading more from this author. Personally, I read any type romance novel as long as there is strong chemistry between hero and heroine, and this book delivers. I highly recommend this read. It is a safe read. There is no OW or OM. Heroine is strong and resilient. Hero is protective and caring. Read it on my KU and would read again.
0,I feel in love with these books from the first book! I do have to say I did hate how the second one ended and that I couldn't wait to see how things were going to work out. The author did a great job with the layout and the book was well written. I had an easy time following the story line and getting into what the book had to offer.		The characters come alive to the point that I cried when they cried lol I am half way through the fourth book and loving it just as much as I love all of these.		I was happy to see that no matter what love came out on top and that everything that came their way they ended up working everything out even if it had to get so bad that there were thoughts of it being over. I feel that the author did a great job and representing real life situations into a book that can teach her readers at the same time of enjoying a good read too!
0,Great conclusion to Briley and Cooper's story. This book was full of twists and turns and suspense, all the while keeping the romance alive.
0,SIGNS OF LIFE (Resilient Love #2) by Melanie Hansen is one of the best M/M romances Ive ever read. The novel opens with a heartbreaking chapter that had me immediately invested in the story. I desperately wanted Jeremy to find love again, because he was such a caring person and deserved to be happy. He had loved and lost so much that its difficult for him to move on. It takes a pretty special man to break through his walls, make him feel alive again, and fill up the empty parts of him with a larger than life kind of love.		Kai is half-Latino and comes from an entirely different background. Jeremy is a wealthy and successful lawyer who has never had to worry about money. Kais dad left his mom when he was a kid. He didn't grow up with money and used to be a gangster. Because of Kais troubled youth and harsh past, Kai is dedicated to helping his students improve their lives. Kai has been through a lot and is a survivor, whereas Jeremy came into Kais life feeling broken. However, their social and class differences aren't obstacles in their relationship but actually bring them closer together.		Not to mention, Kai is the most stunningly gorgeous man Jeremy has ever met. When they encounter each other at a club, their chemistry is so intense and consuming that they instantly hook up. Given how caring and tender Jeremy was with his husband, I didn't except to Jeremy to be so dominating and the sex between Jeremy and Kai to be so mind-blowingly hot and exciting and seriously just WOW.		Jeremy and Kai are shaken by their intense encounter. Jeremy doesnt know what came over him. Hes so horrified by his uncharacteristic indiscretion that he leaves Kai without a word. Meanwhile, Kai feels used because he believed they had a real connection. When Jeremy realizes he had been a jerk for leaving Kai so abruptly, he feels guilty and ashamed. Jeremy has some serious groveling to do, because he cant deny that he feels that same life-altering connection.		When circumstances bring them together again, Jeremy has a chance to make things right. Seeing the world from Kais perspective and compassionate nature opens Jeremy up to new possibilities and motivates him to be a better person. Step by step, Kai breaks through Jeremys walls and Jeremy lets him in. As Jeremy and Kai fall deeper in love, they become more essential to each other and their lovemaking becomes even more meaningful, ever so deliciously dirty and tender in the afterglow.		Opposites attract as Kai is turned on by Jeremys powerful charisma and crisp, tailored suits and Jeremy is turned on by Kais toughness and confidence in his own skin. Despite Kais past, Kai isn't afraid of Jeremy topping him and proves he can give as good as he gets. The sex is just as hot when Kai takes charge.		Jeremy and Kai have their ups and down as they navigate their new relationship and intense feelings for each other. I loved how they worked things out in the end and imagined their future togetherhow they learned to take care of each other and respect each others needs, and became real and equal partners in love and life.		SIGNS OF LIFE is raw, moving, and sexy as hell. It broke my heart and pieced it back together, and had me smiling at the sheer sweetness of the happy ending. I loved the positive themes of this novelthe importance of friendship in difficult times and the life-affirming power of love.		I loved how Kais best friend Loren helped Kai heal with such loving care and patience. I appreciate how the traumatic incident wasn't shown in flashbacks or scenes. Instead, since the focus was on Kais healing, I felt completely safe reading this book.		It was a pleasure to see a special scene featuring Jeremys best friend Jase and Carey, the couple from Everything Changes (Resilient Love #1). I also appreciate how authentically and sensitively mental health issues are portrayed in this series. I very much look forward to reading Lorens story next and many more M/M romances by Melanie Hansen.		*I received an eARC from the publisher in exchange for a fair and honest review.
0,The recipes sounded good and nutritional information	was included with each one - which is a BIG PLUS for dieters.	The illustrations were attractive. The instructions were clearly	understandable. Ingredients wer familiar to us in the U.S.
0,I enjoyed the novel very much. I was entertained by the novel.
0,I really enjoyed this story. It is a continuation of Chloe and Skye's story that started in "The Friend Zone". The love story between Chloe and Skye is so sweet to watch but the underlying story of an abusive ex-boyfriend who has decided that Chloe is with him or no one is hard to take. There were some twists that I didn't see coming.  I thought it was written well and will look for future books from this author.
0,This story had me wanting to go choke some of these characters. I couldn't stand Boston and his arrogant self. He knew what he'd done and didn't think it was gone catch up with him. Rorie had me wanting to slap her naive self. Vito was the man I loved his character. I'm so glad he rescued Rorie. Miko needed her butt kicked for the way her and her sisters treated Rorie. She got off too easy. Great Job
0,This definitely leaves the reader yearning to hear more of the exploits of the Blitzkrieg team. It answers all of the questions posed from the first book and then raises anticipation for the next book.
0,I have found a new author.  Loved these sweet books.  Laughed and cried both and I highly recommend.  I plan on reading the rest of the series. If you are in the mood for a sweet romance pick up this one.
0,Loved their story again. Sad it ended and wished there was a little more to the ending, but loved it all nonetheless. Can't wait to read about Caim's father next!!!
0,I bought and read this short eBook as one of the books to help me write my own "Book Publishing Instructions" book. As I bought and read it near the end of my writing process, it was only marginally helpful, and I ended up using none of the ideas presented in this book. If I had bought it earlier in the writing process, it would have been more helpful. By the time I bought it, I already knew most of what was presented in this book. I was primarily seeking an easy way to enable the Kindle Table of Contents button and the Kindle Guide through submitting an HTML document to Kindle Direct Publishing.		Though there were a few hints that were helpful, I ended up finding my own way. Nevertheless, if one is looking to publishing their book solely on the Kindle, this is a good introductory guide. If, however, one wants to publish their book for the iPad, Nook, and as a paperback, there are other more complete guides which might be helpful.		So have you read lots of other Kindle Publishing Guides? You may not need this book. Have you read no other guides? Well, then maybe check out this book as well as a few others.
0,This book is a good read. Actually it's pretty well put together to say the least. There isn't any fluff which is good and the content is pure value. I highly recommend this book to any married couple!
0,Oh so funny!! Drama and steam! Don't miss out on this one!
0,This story was totally shrouded in mystery when it comes to really knowing what is going on.  I read the whole thing from cover to cover and yet, I only have a slight inkling of what is going on behind the scenes of a quiet country small town.  I gained certain impressions of the people and their actions through this book, but there is a larger part of me that cautions about forming too strong of conclusions because I think what is to come will flip my initial impressions on their heads.  At least I hope that's where all this is going because this felt like a set-up book more than anything else.		Donna lives with her widowed father who is a handyman.  Their circumstances are much reduced from once they were before her dad lost the farm, her mother died in child birth and her brother disappeared.  She goes through life quietly with just her two friends, Spencer and Becca.  They're all low on the food chain at the highschool which is particularly sad for Donna because her best friend growing up, Ryan, began treating her as a non-entity too.  He's now the typical jock with the witchy head cheerleader girlfriend and has a bully for an older brother.  Only when they are really alone like when they're out sharing the town jogging path does he briefly smile.		Well, suddenly Donna's nothing life gets a bit more interesting and scary when she suddenly has the ability to turn into pure electricity, move through solid objects, pull juice in from electrical objects and shock the stuffing out of anyone she touches.  Unfortunately, her first demonstration lost her the only two friends she has when they both run off and leave her because of their fears.		While she lives in fear over what is happening to her, all sorts of strange things are going on around her.  The story switched to all the main players points of view showing that the bully, the jock and the cheerleader aren't what they seem in some ways.  Her friends have their own concerns to worry about.  And there is something big being hidden right in that small town.  Donna and some others must figure out what before really bad things start to happen.		Okay, as I said the plot was more loose than I like, but it did offer some good intrigue.  It was as twisty and vague as it could possibly be and I found out that I really enjoyed the feeling of knowing there was something going on, but not knowing what.  I love good world building, but I felt that this story withheld a great deal for the sake of the mystery part.  I can live with that- for now.  The tone of this story is dark through this first segment like storm clouds are gathering. I got the impression that there is a lot of manipulation going on in the story by shadowy characters pulling everyone's string.  All the characters hold a piece of the truth, but not all of it so everything is skewed.  Look forward to it all being unraveled		I'm still trying to decide how I feel about all those kids even after having gotten their perspectives because the story is told from several points of view, but mostly Donna's.  Donna is a genuine dear and you almost weep for all that she loses in this story at no fault of her own.  Her friends were nice, but typical when faced with something way the heck out of their comfort zone.  I wanted to hate them for abandoning Donna, but honesty makes me admit that if fear was my overall feeling then I might run too.  Lynn, the pop cheerleader, is typical.  She's a strutting Queen B and enjoys spreading misery around her.  She has the most popular guy in school for a boyfriend, but its still not enough and Donna is her favorite figurative punching bag.  Ryan's brother Randy has been an angry bully all his life, but gaining his perspective shows that his reactions are due to a past of pain and heartbreak.  He resents his brother, but there is a part of him that is protective too.  Then we come to Ryan.  Here's where I really hope that things are really not what they seem.  Donna crushes on him and in secret he wants her, but there's some mysterious reason he can't have her and was forced to cut off contact with her.  I would be alright with that because its for her own good possibly- like he's a danger to her, but its the pathetic way he stands quietly by and lets her get picked on by the people in his crowd of friends that only made me feel anger and disappointment in him.		The end of this one totally set things up for the next book and left me eager for what comes next.		As to warnings, it would be fine for mid to older teens.  There's drinking, partying and references to sex, but no actual scenes.  Mild to moderate violence takes place during one of the final scenes.		Those who enjoy YA Sci-Fi Romance with a twisty plot mystery should try this one.
0,i picked this up on a whim. it was only .99 so i said what the heck i'll give it a try. Glad i did. i loved it. the characters were great. the storyline was good.

This book has it all...hot sex, a little angst and no cliffhanger (Yay!) I liked how the author added a few cameo appearances from Poppy and Felix, who are from the first book. Sheila is hilarious...I would love to read her story....Overall, this is one HOT book and I would love to read more from this author!

0,Omg! I swear this author is trying to kill me! I love her work and I loved this novella as well. Just when you think all is good at the end of a Cassia Brightmore novel, she hits you hard and your sitting there thinking "I'm going to kill her"! That is the closest to a spoiler you will get out of me and you HAVE to read this! If you've read her previous novels in this series and loved them then you will love this one too!
0,Fun read, enjoyed the humor.
0,This story went straight into the heat and ran the whole way. While I appreciated the loose plot and character development to give it some chops, this story was all about the action & heat. And the author delivered, in a well-written manner. So often this type of book is either all raunchy & not well-written, or trying too hard to deliver a plot but lacking the heat and failing at both. Not so with this fast little read. Writing is strong. Characters are developed even in such short space. And the author delivers a 5 on the HEAT rating. Make no mistake: this is an erotica short, not a HEA romance. And if that's what you're looking for, this story delivers! Happy, um, reading...
0,This story is definitely more action packed and suspenseful than its prequel and I love it for it. It was wonderfully written and is very intricately woven, so its important to keep the characters straight in your head. But if you stick with it and follow what's happening I guarantee that you won't be disappointed. I highly recommend this book and can't wait until the next installment.		I received a free copy of this book in exchange for a fair and honest review.
0,A lot of people I know do not understand these puzzles. I try to explain how to do them and let them have a chance to try. Some get it, some do not!
0,Jesse is on leave from Motocross, because he was injured on the job. He has become negative, because of everything going on especially the fact that his hand and leg were injured. I loved this book, because there is love, trouble maker,  heartache and a HEA.
0,OMG OMG OMG this was so AWESOME and BEAUTIFUL!!!!! I LOVED LOVED LOVED IT SOOO MUCHHHH!!! It was super awesome, sweet, funny, naughty and cute! I loved it and I could not put it down till I finished it! Cant wait for more books in this series! ^_^
0,Home for Good is a wonderful, heartwarming story about following your dream and maybe finding a new dream that you didn't know you wanted.  Terri Reed has a winner on her hands with the sweet story.		After her father passes away, Joelle returns home to Montana to sell her half of the ranch.  Only problem is that her childhood enemy Matt, doesn't want to sell.  Joelle's father raised Matt, he was the son he never had.  Matt refuses to sell because it's his legacy.  Joelle needs the money to make her jewelry line go global.  Joelle and Matt have problems that need to be worked out.  When Joelle looks at Matt, she see's the boy who her father favored over her, but as they spend time together on the ranch, their perceptions and feelings for one another change.  I was rooting for Joelle and Matt and I'm glad they got their happy ending.
0,I love Japanese food, but never had any idea on how to cook it. I am so glad I came across this book. It really gives so many recipes that are well laid out and fairly easy to make. It even has pictures of the meals, as well as the nutritional facts for each one. I definitely recommend this book if you are looking into Japanese cuisine, for beginners and intermediates alike.
0,This is he first book of Margaret Fischers Ive read, and I hope there will be more after this one. It was a good read... well, okay, it was a good listen. The characters were easy to like, the details of the story, the quirkiness of it all had me enamored at times.		I mean, who almost has an accident and wakes up to be something different than you first start out in life. When Meg, the quiet, straight laced, high school student, discovers this very thing it throws her into a whole knee world. However, shes not always good at landing on her feet. She has a hard road of ew things to learn, new people and places to learn about...		Its a whole new world and thankfully Meg has new friends to help guide her in the direction of someone new, and a new way of thinking....
0,I love this series.  I have read all three books.  She also has another series in the Moretti Werewolf series.  Loved them
0,I love historical romance novels especially about the South. This is a wonderful book about the aftermath of the Civil War and what the survivors had to do to survive. I agree it was a little slow starting, but I still enjoyed it.
0,This book was a great read, the story was wonderful and fast based.  The characters  were wonderfully written and meshed very well together.  I recommend this book if you are looking for a nice story with a great story line.
0,Quake is the debut novel from author Jacob Chance. The premise of Quake is an interesting one, and quite different from anything else I've seen published recently, which was a huge positive for me. It follows the relationship between Kyle and Janny, who have an unconventional start to say the least.		I absolutely loved this book and read it in one sitting. Your attention is captured from the start of the prologue to the very last word written. And the first chapter is probably the hottest one that I've read! The chemistry between the two lead characters is hot but, importantly, the emotional connection is just as strong; I really enjoyed seeing the relationship between Kyle and Janny grow into something substantial and real.		The story is well paced, the writing is strong and confident (which is even more impressive when considering this is a debut author) and the characters are complex and compelling. There is an honesty and depth to this book that endears these characters to you, and makes you hope that they get their happy ending.		Overall a very enjoyable, high quality read, that I would definitely recommend.
0,Just the kind of men one would love to meet. To bad there aren't really many like them out there
0,Just finished reading 'Relatively Risky' book 1 of the "The Big Uneasy" series by Pauline & I can honestly say that I really enjoyed this book. Although at first I found it hard to relate to the lead female, which then made it hard to get into the book... I actually put this down for a few days before jumping back in. (Note to self, don't read too many of the same genre in 1 hit). After my little break I was able to focus & get into the book alot easier. I soon found myself lost within the story... I was lost in the visuals given to me by the author, laughing in some parts... also I sepnt most of the book trying to figure out who was trying to kill Nell??... what possible information her parents left?? if they left any.... Would Alex kiss Nell?? soo many questions roaming my head.		The depth of infomation given throughout the book, helps with the depth of the plot & characters. Pauline's attention to detail made it easy to not get mixed up with all that was going on & painted such a vivid picture throughout the book. Making things easy to remember but also get lost within. I can't wait to read what comes next in the series.
0,This was really good. I really enjoyed it. The characters were great and funny. This is first book I have read of this author and do plan on reading more. Definitely a must read. Happy reading.
0,This is the story of Tessa, a woman on her way to fulfilling her plan of living in France. First she has to earn the money by going to an exclusive island where she's been invited to be one of the submissives for a week. There she meets Sir Felix who quickly becomes Master Felix, a Dom who seems to know her in and out after only a few hours and fulfils her kinky sexual fantasies. But what will happen after the week ends?		This is my first time of reading this author and I will certainly read her again. The location is well described and I felt as if I was there with the characters. The erotic scenes totally sizzled and were tastefully done. Great thought was put into describing each scene and interaction between the Tessa and her Master.		The characters were perhaps a little too perfect--Tessa being the perfect submissive. She just went with the flow.  And Felix was the perfect Master able to seemly read her mind and give her everything she desired.		That was all good. But I wanted more. I wanted to know the people behind the kinky role play. I wanted to connect with them and this didn't happen until the end of the story when their insecurities started to show and I started seeing them as fallible humans beings.		Unfortunately this ends with a cliff-hanger. Many things are left unresolved. Do I care enough about the characters to want to read the next book? I don't know. We'll see.		However, I still recommend this book to fans of BDSM erotica because the BDSM and the erotica are really well done, which makes this is a solid 4 Lovebites read.
0,What a delightful storyline with lots of love and romance. The storyline captured me from the very first page, it was beautifully written.	I enjoyed the pace of this story and how the author developed the romance between the two main characters.
0,Although at times the story became confused by the author of using  only a characters first name then followed later using only the characters last name this tale is enjoyable. Convoluted twists and turns all add to the story. Just knowing whom exactly is who keeps,you on the edge.
0,I love salads and I really love this cookbook!  This is a great vegetarian salad cookbook....a perfect example that there is plenty of variety in salads.  I eat lots of salads and I have never seen a recipe for eggplant salad...can't wait to try that one.  As always, Mary's pictures are beautiful and make the dishes just jump off the page.  There is nothing "boring" here!
0,Very enjoyable. It kept my interest from cover to cover.  This is a wonderful way to spend a hot or cold day.  I love the fact that you are able to meet a lot of memorable characters as well as discover their stories as well.
0,Interesting new start of a series.  I liked the characters involved and am looking forward to more about the badlands!
0,This short story was a very nice read from start to finish.  I LOVE Christmas and Christmas stories.  Especially when like with this e book was such an easy read.  Thank You!!!!
0,Ain't Even Done with the Night is a sensual tale that will have you fanning yourself and wishing for some chocolate! Lou and Dianna have explosive chemistry that grips you from the first moment they lay eyes on one another! This story has it all romance, danger, adventure, and the right amount of sizzle.		Keara Kevay has an extraordinary talent of mixing romance, thrills, and alpha males. Ain't Even Done With the Night will not disappoint! Once you pick it up you will not be able to put it down!		I recieved a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.

0,I enjoyed this book. This book would be considered a self-help book to get people to find their true self and to build from there to reach their full potential and happiness. I would have to say that part of it I had already understood from my lessons in motor programing. People speak about muscle memory but muscles have no brain and therefore cannot remember. Instead you change what you need to and practice it until it becomes almost second nature. This book discussed using visualizations to get yourself to where you want to be. This goes along with motor programing as it is the first step. In coaching, I tell my students to watch the good plays and players and visualize them doing some of the things that they do and then they may be able to accomplish them. Another thing that I liked was that it talked about the importance of ones attitude and how that can affect the outcome of ones goals. Finally, I liked how the book stressed that each person is unique and the same method or practice may not be best for everyone just like the employee, teammate, and etc. is unique and should be seen as such. I would recommend this book to anyone looking to reflect on yourself to see how you can improve your everyday boring life.
0,Now this book was great, couldn't put it down once I got started, great story line.. honesty is definitely the best policy..
0,Melissa does a great job of helping you navigate the world of Pinterest. She has over a million followers. I tend to listen to people's advice who have proven that they are successful at something. Melissa gives very helpful hints about what to do and what not to do to grow your presence on Pinterest. In this easy to read and helpful guide, Melissa shares all of her secrets. I highly recommend this book!
0,This book was great!!!! I read all of them in 2 days. I can say I didn't want it to end this is one of those books that you get engulfed in and you feel for the characters! Which makes you want the story to go on even when the ending was a good ending no cliff hangers or anything but you just eant more!
0,"Pairing Off" by Elizabeth Harmon.  This one tells the tale of Anton, a Russian figure skater, and Carrie, an American one.  What's not to like about Anton?  He's big and strong and is a perfect gentleman, always looking out for those he loves and cares about.  Carrie is sweet and kind, despite having some dark secrets and carrying around some pretty heavy baggage.  I enjoyed the two of them together, although at times, I was so frustrated - I just wanted them to get together already.  However, I wouldn't have asked Ms. Harmon to change anything.  I enjoyed the skating portion as well - the author did a great job of making the reader feel they were on the ice with Anton and Carrie.  And touring around Russia was beautiful.  This is a true romance with a bit of drama and angst but I really enjoyed it and came to really love Anton and Carrie and was rooting for them the whole way.  (Received copy from NetGalley for honest review)
0,Cover Review:		This cover is sexy! I like how the woman has a hold of the man's tie. I shows that she has some kind of power over him, which Melina does have over Hayden in this book. The way his clothes are askew shows a wildness to him that matches Hayden perfectly.		Book Review:		Hayden Dean is set to inherit the position of Alpha of the San Francisco wolf pack after his father's death, but his public image is so bad that the Council is reluctant to pass on the reins. They hire Melina Rae, a columnist at a local magazine that has a talent for making terrible celebrity images look good, to fix Hayden's public image. Problem is that Melina already has her own opinion of Hayden, since he stood her up almost a year ago. Things go from bad to worse when a pack of Rogue wolves start attacking turned wolves and any non-shifters associated with them, making Melina a target. If he wants to protect the one woman meant for him, Hayden needs to rise to the challenge and finally put others before himself, he needs to become the Alpha.		I thought that the world of this book was interesting. There is this war going on between born and turned wolves. The Rogues are against turned wolves and see them as inferior, something unnatural. Which puts a huge target on Hayden's back, since he's the turned adopted son of the late Alpha, set to take the Alpha position himself. When the Rogue's attacks reach a point that Hayden can't do nothing about, he goes to the Council but finds no support from them. The only person Hayden feels he can trust within the Pack is his best friend and second, Gabriel. Hayden goes through a lot of doubt and uncertainty in his ability to lead the Pack, but when it comes down to it, he leads selflessly and with the true heart of an Alpha.		The chemistry between Hayden and Melina is hot! Melina is wary of Hayden when they first start working together because of how he stood her up almost a year ago. But as they get to know each other better, she sees a side of him that only those close to him get to see. And she sees how the media twist his good deeds to make him look bad. Hayden is so drawn to Melina because she is his Luminary, his fated mate. I loved how protective he was of her, but I didn't necessarily like how he tried to push her away, even if it was for good reasons. When they finally put the past and present events on the back burner and focus on the now and how they feel for each other, they have a passionate and love-filled relationship. I enjoyed the banter between them and how Melina toyed with Hayden as payback for standing her up. Hayden and Melina were a couple that I really liked and I'd love to see more of in future books.		Rating:		I gave The Werewolf Wears Prada a 5 STAR rating. The world was interesting and I'm looking forward to seeing what happens with the rogues and the SF Pack. Hayden and Melina are a delightful couple that I really enjoyed reading about. Their journey to each other wasn't an easy one. I'm hoping that the next book will be Gabriel's.
0,I received this book for free from eBook Discovery. I voluntarily review this book. This is my honest review.		Two Hearts Unspoken is a quick read enjoyable read. It is well-written with vivid imagery that had me invested in the characters. The chemistry betweenBeth andZack kept me engrossed in this story. Their journey to HEA was endearing and inspiring. I adored the epilogue, which left me with a big smile on my face.
0,The story line and the characters had great depth. It felt like the author had a lot of ideas but she was able to get them all together.
0,This book was a wonderful read. It most definitely made you think with all of the different storylines. The authors did a wonderful job making three different stories intertwine and connect. This book definitely had sad elements at times. I felt the loss of what Olive & Harry had. Makes you think of things you settle for.		I loved the mention of Tradd Street in this book, by the way. Anyone who has read Karen Whites Tradd Street series would understand.
0,This book was one of the best I have read in a while. This a story that is going to stick with me for a while. As someone who has seen a loved one go through what Theo did it kind of took me back. Awesome story! I am looking forward to more from Mrs. James-Fisher
0,For All Time is the first book in a new series about Cora and Dorian. She's already his Cognate. an Agnate's (vampire) mate. She's overcome most of her fears about their relationship and has accepted their future together. Sex scens are very steamy and hot...just the way i like them. Cora tells her friends abaut her engagement, and they meet Dorian for the first time.	The book is well edited and written, the flow of the story is logical and enjoyable.	I am so glad the story continues! I really enjoy Cora & Dorian. The only problem is the books are far too short.	I cant wait to reed next one.
0,Great story
0,This was is another good romantic suspense book by Katie Reus.  After reading six books by Katie one thing I have noticed is how diverse Katie is in her stories.  Many times when you read several books by the same author you tend to find the same plot ideas, but Katie does a great job of writing very different stories. In this story we find Adam, who was hired by Izzy's father to watch out for her without her knowing.  He was also supposed to get her to move back home.  In return, Adam's security company was going to land a lucrative contract from Izzy's father. What started out as a job turned into much more. Throw in a serial rapist in the area that is now after Izzy and you have a lot going on in the story.		One of the things that kept me from putting down the book wasn't the serial rapist that was on the loose and after Izzy, but Adam and Izzy's relationship.  I kept wondering when he was going to come clean about who he really was. Izzy kept telling herself to trust him and it frustrated me that Adam was lying to her, even if he didn't want to.  I admired Izzy's strength as a woman who wanted to be independent from her father and also how much she cared for her friends. Adam was the typical protective alpha male in the book, but he had to fight with himself so much to figure out the right way to be with Izzy, including when to tell her the truth and how to protect her.  This was a great story from start to finish. If you are looking for an emotional romantic suspense story, I highly recommend this one.
0,LOVED this series!
0,Great read.
0,I have read a couple of books from this author or some that he has recommended himself; which he does at the end of his books.  This is based some on history and of course fiction, but all in all it kept my interest, although it did drag a little in some places,  I could see this storyline being turned into a movie.  It might be hard for the "average" reader to keep up with all the characters and history references however it is still worth the money.  It just may manage to keep you up late at night.
0,Syrinx is the God of Chasity and she won't break her vows. Pan makes her want things she can't have so she runs from him and hides in the twenty-first century. Running a floral shop she lives a normal mortal life. She takes a job for a great looking man named Parker to decorate his estate for a gala. She worries because she starts to fall for Parker. Pan won't give up wanting Syrinx. He is the God of Fertility and while most maidens run to him, Syrinx is constantly running away. He will do anything to get what he wants including posing as a mortal to trick Syrinx. What he doesn't expect is to fall for Syrinx. She makes him want more than just a fling. However a person from the past is out to make sure they don't come together.		This is a wonderful story that I wanted more of. I love the author's take on Pan and Syrinx. They say opposites attract and in this case they sure do. Syrinx is a great character who only wants to keep her vows. She runs and hides from Pan thinking he will finally give up. She really is just scared of her own feelings and what will happen if she listens to her heart. She has an amazing mortal friend who you really want to have her own story. Pan at first lives up to his image but as he lives as a mortal trying to trick Syrinx he learns what it really means to care for someone else. His butler tells him about his own love and it makes Pan think about what is really important. I enjoyed getting to see both characters open up about what they want and how they feel. If you enjoy mythology or just want a quick good read this may be the one for you.
0,the woman who came to the ranch to help twins a just to growing up with out a mother.she fell in love with the family.
0,This was another good read by author. I really like her books, they're clean whodunit, with just enough mystery surrounding it.  Nice book for on cold day.
0,Really love this author!
0,I absolutely loved Latakia, then wasn't a big fan of Last Day of Summer, but with this one, Smith has hit it out of the park again.  The subtle beauty of his prose and the way he can get inside a character's heart and soul, are amazing.  So amazing, that I actually believed a relationship begun in brutality and violence could end in love.  That is a hard story to believe!  But Smith's extremely textured character development and rich back-stories accomplished it.  And I loved how he used the metaphor of the fence and the forest to express so much, but did it with a light hand.		***MILD SPOILER***	My one disappointment was how...well, sappy...the book was at the end. The extent to which everything became "happy happy joy joy" just didn't synch with the rest of the book.  Smith was more measured during the whole book, then became heavy handed with the happy ending.
0,It explains so much about Tor! So enjoyed this one :)  It's important to read each in the series in order, because they all flow along in time and experiences. Such an imagination the author has! I would love to live in this world and be a builder! :)
0,This and Delaney 's story alter the two best books I've ever written. I love this series it's the best
0,Get the Kleenex out, this one is so heartfelt!  Drama, kidnapping, conspiracies, WOW!  You will just fall in love with Steele and Roxanne, if he has a brother I have dibs Enjoy
0,This series of stories - have read all four - was enjoyable, not just for the interesting kink - which was really well developed and explored - but for the obvious care each person took that the other was happy and comfortable. Often kink stories don't show that or they seem really mean and uncaring. This series left me feeling happy and glad I ran across it.
0,This is the second book of the( DOM vs Domme series.)This book takes off where the first book( Bite Me ) left off. This is one of the best series. I recommend this book.
0,great story from begining to end kepp me glued to my seat. lots of twist's and heart stopping moments. lovely end.
0,All of the Code Breakers books are exciting but have lots of violence.  Thus, late teens and up for the family. I enjoyed the technology too.  Lots here to think about!  :-)
0,First off I have read all of Oblivion books.	I loved the way Nick and Lila came together. Their love story was amazing.  To feel the emotion that Nick and Simon had to go thru to get their friendship and band together kept me turning the pages...I only wish there would be more of Oblivion stories.
0,I can't get enough of Merry Farmer's wonderful series, The Brides of Paradise Ranch! This was my 5th visit to Haskell, Wyoming, an extraordinary western town populated by many unforgettable characters.  This story spotlights Athos Strong, the town's railroad station manager, his 8 rowdy children, and Elspeth Leonard, his mail-order bride. I fell in love with Athos and his unruly but lovable offspring, especially little 4yr old Thomas. Ms. Farmer fully illustrates and defines the personality of each Strong sibling and the immediacy of her writing makes readers feel completely in the moment as we experience every prank, every hug, every tear, and every "I love you, Papa". Things seem to be looking up for Athos and his children with the addition of Elspeth to their lives, but a threat to their happiness is soon revealed.  Based on a perceived insult to their delusions of grandeur and entitlement, the despicable Rex Bonneville and his 3 harpy daughters are determined to devastate the Strong family by removing the children with trumped up accusations of abuse and neglect.  The sequence of events following this vicious move by the Bonnevilles kept me enthralled with this story to the very end.  This is a truly not-to-be-missed historical western romance that will find a permanent place on every reader's favorites shelf.
0,Love this Miss Fortune series.  Fortune and her two nosey partners in crime solving, are in for it this time.  This is such a funny series and yet a very good mystery.  The people in the town are very well developed and you feel like they are your neighbors.  This book moves right along.
0,Okay, I've just discovered this author. After reading the synopsis of the this book, I thought let me give her a try. I said this book is going to piss me off because I would've wasted $3 for a disappointment. Boy was I so wrong. Omg, the introduction to Max and hi team of Alpha warriors had praying for my own version. Then Tamara sauntered into his life and he asked if she was as into him as he was into her. Yes baby, yes she was! This book has adventure, kidnappings, hot sex scenes (but not overrated sex scenes), hate, joy, pain, disappointment and and a sense of togetherness, military brotherhood! Loved it! Hope book two is even better
1,The subject (hero? beats me I am sticking around to find out) of the story gets shot down on page 1 and has now spent 56 pages talking about building a fire and eating some berries.		I read the first book in this series and was absolutely amazed that i made it through it. The author at point describes a SAW (an M249 squad automatic weapon firing 5.56mm) as more devastating that a Browning M2 heavy machine gun.		Really? Do any research at all?		Really sorry i wasted money on this
1,This was a very thin story about a Vampire and a werewolf who are supposed to mate to save their species against demons but who magically fall in love two seconds after they meet - and on a side note they take out the demons. Boring one-domensional characters, a plot that didn't make sense and and poorly written love scenes.
1,Wast of time
1,Was originally given the unedited copy that was filled grammatical errors and poor organization.  While it is true amazon allowed me to download a new copy of this book, the damage was already done.  Sorry Ms. Parker.
1,It was an ok book. It has a lot of potential but I felt it was kind rushed and there could have been a lot more told about Ryan & Emma. Our just felt like something was missing. I did not really get into it.
1,I got so excited about this book, so I of course went and bought it.  HUGE MISTAKE! I have NEVER EVER been unable to finish a book no matter how awful it was, I would still push through.  I could absolutely not finish this book because there were HUGE pieces missing.  I would be happily reading then all of a sudden I would flip the page and... it started on about something else.  I had no clue what was going on so I kept reading thinking it was just a little error.  Nope. This happened a lot! I would definitely recommend waiting until this is fixed, and hopefully the next reader has a better reading time then I did.
1,The is was a very long and dragged out read for me. The situations were totally unrealistic. Lots of flaws here and there especially with the medical and police situation. Very unbelievable to the point of ridiculous. I felt like enough already.  With that said...I think there is a lot of humerous banter with the character Jake.  That is what I liked best.  I will not read anything else from this author... Just my opinion...
1,My least favorite book by Jennifer Peel. Repetitious and a very slow read. My favorite parts were about the characters from the first book, Taylor and Easton just didn't click for me and the book had a negative vibe till the end.
1,I'm a fan of this author, but I am totally disappointed in this 'story'. Glad it was free....thank you Kindle Unlimited! There are some truly great stories out there, this isn't one of them. The story and characters had no real development and the ending felt rushed. Tally is now happy being a kidnapped whore and baby machine? Uh huh. Right. No thanks!
1,This is a hard trope to pull off well. This is a particularly bad example why. Reads like a 15-year-old's idea of a romance with a CEO.
1,There are really great recipes but a few of them are not campfire meals. There are some you need to start at home. Not what I was thinking it was going to be about.
1,After reading 50 shades trilogy several times, i thought I liked them, but Grey was better. Learning what was going the Grey's mind, I'm not too sure I care for them.
1,Great
1,I'm only continuing to read this for laughs.  The author uses every word in the English language, often wrong.  "cacophony of pandemonium"  I laughed out loud.  He has no sense of time.  It took 4 or 5 hours for the parents to get to the kids, after beginning their trip two hours after the EMP, but he tells the kids it happened two hours ago.  He even offers his gun to a teacher but she refuses and tells him he's in a gun-free zone.  People were rushing from the museum.  Why?  Black hawk helicopters were dropping soldiers down ropes near the museum.  Why?  They carried rifles with 100 round magazines.  LOL.		Please don't waste your time on this poor attempt at writing.
1,DNF: I stopped at 38%. I got this because it was for free and figured I'd try it out. After 38%, I don't even want to read any more to see how it turns out even if this is a novella.		I just couldn't get past how rude "He/Sir" was and I find the need for "liquid courage" by the heroines of these stories to be ridiculous. Mac might try to come off as strong and confident, but needs the drinks to talk to him. That's ridiculous. If a guy talked to me like that, I'd walk away.		She's considering going home with him eventhough she doesn't even know his name. From the other reviews, apparently, his name is never revealed. He talks to her in a demeaning way. Even if he likes to be dominant, there should still be a level of respect, love, and understanding.		Not for me
1,From the cover and the description, I anticipated this to be a dark, intense read.  Instead, I got a YA romantic comedy crossed with a Scooby-Doo mystery.		This book is about teenage FBI agents (no, seriously) who are undercover in high school.  The "gang" they are trying to get are into drug dealing and human trafficking.  There is too much lightheartedness to take things seriously here.		Joy is a college photography student (who acts like a blushing 14 year old virgin) who gets some crime photos and is taken to a safe house.  Will is the agent protecting her.  Turns out he had a crush on her in high school and spends most of the book trying to make out with her.  Never mind people are trying to kill them, it's flirting and blushing time!		There's a parallel storyline about Kara, a high school girl, and Derek, the FBI agent who's in love with her.  Seriously, the Bureau wouldn't frown on this?		The action is cheesy, and doesn't make a lot of sense, even when it's all explained at the end.  The FBI uses Joy and her friend, Jen, to help in a rescue (really!), and of course Joy goes "rogue" and eye-rolling abounds!  At one point the villain is running after them yelling, "I'm gonna get you bitches!".  Come on!  Even Shaggy and the gang were more believable than this.
1,eh
1,Seriously, everything was fine (even if it was kinda rushed) until super convoluted s**t was added!!!!! Super annoyed because it was a great plot than BAM let's shake it up with a random (unneeded) plot twist, because reasons!!! The logic was messed up with the plot twist and the time needed to really develop it was NOT given! It was kinda like taking someone's phone, smashing it, then saying "It mad me mad." There's no WHY  in there! Very rushed and skipped over to the point it was ruined. I couldn't even read past 75% it was so stupid!!!!
1,Most of this book could have and should have been condensed and joined with book 6 of the series at best!
1,A quick read, the basic girl meets guy, guy sleeps with girl, girl looks easy. No thrill in this book at all. Would I recommend? No, but if u prefer the simple open story line. This may be the book for you.
1,I was doubtful that a book this short could live up to the name "Everything BDSM". I looked through it and realized that being more of a dictionary this site has the same info for free. https://www.xeromag.com/fvbdglossary.html	Frankly, so much falls under the term BDSM, neither of them will give you everything. It's not bad, but you don't have to pay for that.
1,I recognize that Mr. Nutall is entitled to the politics that he likes. He is also entitled to promote those politics via writing and publication like this, but this novel disappointed me.		When I read partisan magazines, I fully expect straw-men arguments, sloppiness and pandering to the particular ideology. In that case, the magazine article is a success. Or, at least, not a failure.		However, in a novel I expect more nuance. I expect ideas to be fully developed. I don't expect to see assertions made and then narrative choice to "prove" those assertions.		This novel had the whole armed militia, second amendment dog-and-pony show. Hatred of the Feds? Check. Worship of armed forces as if they could only be forces of good? Check. Dismissal of religions other than Christianity? Check.		As I said, no nuance.		Again, Mr. Nut all is entitled to write what he likes. I am equally entitled to stop reading it.		If the foregoing does not bother you, the book is fairly well written if simplistic. About 8th grade. Needs a good proof reader, but it's mostly not too jarring.
1,I'm not sure why it says it's a series. It's more like a book of chapters and sub-chapters. This 'book' could stand some serious editing for typos, grammatical errors, word misuse, and more. There are times where you have to just stop and figure out what the author was trying to say. There was one spot that I just gave up and went on. I am not sure what the author meant to say. Often, the author forgets to write 'not' into a sentence and so the sentence says the opposite of what is meant.
1,I like this author, but what I just read left me feeling like I have been taken. The story had a great premise. Unfortunately it had next to no follow through. It had almost no back story, which would have helped. This book seems to have been written haphazardly, with the only outcome being a financial one. Very disappointing.
1,Maybe apple cider vinegar and coconut oil are good for you but this book is mostly hype. I could be convinced but this doesn't come close to making a case for either.
1,This book jumps around more than the energizer bunny on coffee made with redbull instead of water. The characters are likeable, however, the author does not show any of the main points where her characters fall in love or become friends.....one minute we see a barely done haircut and then the next time we see the hairdresser Charlie. He is professing love. Then there is apparently a party with a kiss and a sweet love interest with the bosses boss and we only find out about it later like an afterthought. ... hello this is a big deal that impacts the outcome of the whole story. I suggest new beta readers who will be honest about the hard stuff.
1,I love him everything he do,he stayed away from scandals and he enjoys his private life, he looks he is a very decent man,he don't need a publicized what he is doing like so many do, I never missing his movies,I give two star to this book because is to short is good but I want to read more about him,Johnny Depp, please don't change,money and fame make people change for the worst,they way people adoring them make me feel sick,they are people like us nothing else, but he is one of the kind,Thelma.  Today his in Ellen tv show wow what a treat ! Thanks for having him in your show,is very rear having him in anything'"
1,I really didn't get to read it after many efforts, and I dont'n know why. Really, it doesn't seem that bad, but I cannot get myself in it. There something that get me off
1,This didn't even have enough to be considered a novella. The relationship between the Abbott men was never explained. This book was lacking...everything.
1,the book seems to be a little hard to follow. i really did not care for it. it seemed to jump around  different people , different places. the years kept changing, not my kind of book.
1,Just didn't work.  The humiliation and D/s came out of no where for these two and Lamar is going on, ripping the ring of Ty's finger because there is no trust due to secrets, yet he's keeping secrets too.  Ugh and no
1,Maybe I am alone in my way of thinking, but there are enough horrible things in life; so, I would like my fictional characters to have happy things in the fictional lives.		Futhermore, as another review pointed out, there is no resolution to this story.  This feels like a soap opera with the cliffhanger ending. I read the first one for free, as part of kindle unlimited. The second book is not a part of the kindle unlimited and $2.99 rather than the $0.99 of the first book. So, I don't think I will be reading it.  It it was free with my subscription, then I would probably read it to see what happened to the characters.
1,Anyone who thinks a hollow handle survival knife is a useful tool has never used one. Also, it must be magic to make a nuclear cloud stop at exactly fifty miles. The info is available on dozens of prepper/bug-out web sites. Generally, not too useful.
1,I really liked the first book in this series but the heroine in this book is really frustrating. I liked the character Cade a lot I just thought he was strung along a lot in the book. Bailey (the heroine) needed to do everything by herself and her deadbeat Mom wasn't any help. I felt like Bailey created her own problems but not accepting help when she needed it time after time after time. I swear everything that could go wrong for this girl did. It was really annoying. After a whole book of her fighting to stay on her own two feet I felt like she eventually succumb to help from Cade anyway. I felt that Cade had to suffer because of Bailey's stubbornness and stupidity. It has an HEA but is short. I wish more good things happened for the characters. This book put me in a bad mood for the rest of my day. :( I don't recommend it. I do feel like it was well written and I like the author's other books.
1,The story started off good, but soon fizzled when the main characters became involved with each other. The heroine was immature, whiney, and over used colloquialism that no one from another world would actually understand. I suppose they were used to add humor to the story which is often found in other sci-fi romance novels. The hero was okay, but lacked any real depth.
1,The writing was very amateurish and so disjointed at times that I almost stopped reading. The heroin was a wuss who had a crush on one guy and let him treat her like dirt for years. Then she meets the doctor (our hero) and all of a sudden she's with him. There is no background story on their dates, just a jump from them being at the jerks wedding (that he used all her colors and ideas for, just to mess with her) and then she and the doc have been together for a few months. WHAT?  This author needs to take a creative writing course. I will definitely NOT be reading this person's stories again.
1,This book is interesting.  Not so much for the storyline but for the way it is written.  It seems like the author had an idea for a book and wrote an outline for the story and that is what she published.		There is a decent storyline here and the potential for a really good book but it is not fleshed out.		There's not really any character development so you can't really get attached to them.		  Everything kind of runs together: you'll be reading along about what is happening with Angel present day and then without warning it's a flashback and just as suddenly you're back to present day.		I know that Lauren Calhoun is a new author and as with anything, the more you practice the better you get so I'm sure that the more she writes the better her books will eventually be. However, for right now, I can only give her an A for effort.  I will read the next book to see how it goes though.
1,Couldn't get through it.
1,Not good. Not good enough to get past the 10% mark. That's when I had to force myself to read in order to finish. I really wish I liked it. I just couldn't connect with a single character and didn't care what happened to the princess that spoke five languages but had trouble reading English
1,This story bothered me so much I couldn't finish it and not for the reason you may think. Normally i enjoy t this genre but what I felt was total disregard for the h feeling regarding(spoiler alert) inviting her father to a play club with them was insensitive. I stopped read at the point of punishment regarding her reaction which was for me was VERY understandable. I've enjoyed other books by this author but like my headline this one was totally not for me. If cannot give any more feed back based on the fact that I did not finish this story, I just could not get past what I felt was disrespect for h regrading her family at that point of the story.
1,I'm not big on sexual abuse or woman that take it. I only got a few chapters in an deleted it from my kindle. Unbelieveable
1,Great start of a novel, but clearly unfinished in scope and content.  Unfinished ends abound.
1,**Warning Spoiler Alert**		I thoroughly enjoyed the first book Gargoyle's Mate and I just knew Gargoyle's Challenge would be just as good.  Sadly, I was disappointed.  I waited patiently for this story to come out and the publish date kept getting moved further and further away, thus adding to my anticipation.		I liked Sergei, as the hero of the story he was everything I could have wanted.  Beautiful Emerald eyes, Big and sexy, uber alpha, and oh so determined to claim his mate.  Sergei literally runs into Aman as she delivered packages to his building.  Just a simple touch and he is enamored with he follows her back to her delivery truck and kisses her.		A simple kiss has both Aman and Sergei tied up in knots.  He thinks Aman may be a Fledgling, those capable of mating with a Guardian.  Aman is determined to forget about Sergei and he is just as determined to claim her as his mate.  He doesn't want to spook Aman so is asks her out on a date and Aman brings her friend Sam, who is also a werewolf and witch.		Sam is a werewolf who's been delaying her mating with the aid of her mother's potion.  She thinks that every male is suspect and she immediately recognizes Sergei as a Guardian and she runs off with Aman to her parents house briefly explaining the Guardian mating situation to Aman.		Sergei comes to Sam's parents' house to retrieve Aman.  Sam's parents' are honored to have a Guardian in their home and to Sam's chagrin they do nothing to stop Sergei from taking Aman.  Sergei takes Aman back to his place and he claims her as his mate.  Aman doesn't understand everything clearly, but she's with him all the way.		Now this is where the story goes downhill.  Sergei wants to take Aman to France to celebrate the birth of Lorn and Fatima's (couple from Gargoyle's Mate) first child.  Against his better judgment Sergei allows Aman's friend Sam to accompany them to France.		While in France Sam keeps trouble brewing for Aman and Sergei.  She's in heat and she becomes bitchy and attacks Aman.  Sergei has Aman's memory of being attacked by Sam erased.  Not remembering what happened to her friend, Aman turns against Sergei and denies him as her mate to teach him a lesson.  All it does is cause a riff between him and the guardian counsel.		I didn't like Aman, she had a right to question the whole mating situation, but she kept giving Sergei mixed messages.  She let him screw her sideways, but always tried to keep him at a distance.  I felt that Sam added nothing to the story other than to be the bone of contention that keeps Aman and Sergei apart.		I just thought there could have been a better story line than a bitchy werewolf brewing up trouble.
1,Good book but too shot I wish it was longer when it start ed getting good it's over but I wold remand it
1,I have sampled a few of this authors books but the reviews are so bad and the stories so short that I am afraid to spend my money( I read Alot). They all say the same thing. I will keep my eye out for changes, like editing and longer stories. Good luck!
1,Don't waste your time its stupid story, and part one of how many more to get to the end of a dumb story
1,I would NOT recommend this book, the heroine was very naive and immature, I disliked her very much and felt Stephen, the war hero deserved much better.
1,Confusing, badly edited and repetitive		I got 5 books from this series when they were free for the kindle. I will not be buying any more. I've read 5 books and while I enjoyed the first 2, they are fast going down hill. The plot is repetitive; save Maria, find shelter, and no progress is ever made. The characters keep having the same arguments and making the same bad decisions again and again. The sentence structure is awful with words missing or misplaced as well as lots of wrong word choices (passed instead of past, they're instead of their). It is also confusing trying to figure out which book goes first. Chronologically speaking, it seems like "Villains of the Apocalypse" should be first. It appears to follow the scientists as they are creating the OZ "zombie" virus. The Secret Journal has a part 1 and 2 while the other books are numbered 1 through 4. Maybe the author wrote a prequel and found out they were addictive and just kept writing one more prequel? It doesn't help when most of the books start with a scene and then go back to tell you how they got in this sticky situation.		The description on Amazon is a bit vague. Here's another one.		Three scientists have developed a virus intended for use as a weapon. They are testing it on various groups that no one should really miss (refugees, terrorists and people smugglers for example). There is a containment breach in the Australian Outback and in a short period of time, the country is overrun with zombies. A media blackout meant to control panic and prevent the story from getting out also keeps most of the world ignorant of the disaster. Most of the story is told from Rebecca's point of view, she is an average 16 yr old girl. Other main characters are: Maria Marsh (another teen with an immunity to the virus), Jack (Maria's boyfriend), Kim (Jack's older sister and a police officer in Sydney) and Kenji Yoshido (Rebecca's 19 yr old boyfriend and a marine sniper). The entire focus of the series is getting Maria Marsh out of Australia to the doctors who will hopefully create a cure.		There is a lot of running around Syndey and the Outback trying to escape monsters, looking for transportation, shelter, food and water. You also have religious fanatics sacrificing women and children to the zombies, mutant animals, giant zombies, and rogue nanobots that are animating machinery. I almost forgot, Kenji can see and talk to dead people.
1,This is the first review I've ever felt compelled to leave, after downloading (AND READING) hundreds of e-books. The storyline and details of the book are probably worth four stars, but the horrific lack of editing gave me a headache.  Bad grammar, misspelled words ("of" used when it should be "off") and misused words (too instead of to) made this book a very difficult read.
1,This story was horribly written. The sex scenes were laughable. Not a good book at all...right now it's free so I say decide for yourself but as a person that loves BWWM stories especially the cowboy ones...very disappointing!
1,Finish reading it within a hour. Doesn't give you a lot of history on the characters. Most of the time I was like "are you serious??" IMO this book should only be $1.
1,I am sympathetic with anyone who survived that horrible day but...  something was missing in the telling of this story.  Didn't hold my interest.
1,Keep reading actually scanning and it just never got better. I paid for it so I had to at least finish it even if I was just scanning.
1,I did not feel the connection between the characters.  They seemed very one dimensional therefore the story and their relationship did not flow.  I did love that Malcolm made Jessica feel good about herself and gave her self confidence.
1,The book description for this read did not include lesbian sex scenes. They were more graphic & more lengthy than the male/female scenes. If that's your thing, fine. But put it in the description so for those of us whose thing it's not will know.		Because I live in the "D" I question many things contained in the book.  Shay complained that Kel didn't save money but was always spending.  Then how could Kel buy a house in Sherwood Forest/Palmer Woods, where even with the past property value decline in the city, this area's homes are large and in the upwards of $100,000 (during the decline) the values have increased recently.  Then she buys a house full of furniture. I know that this is fiction but be consistent.  Then Shay's mother's boyfriend is a broke dealer but can put the house in his name?	The book was a okay read.  Can't get with writing that is farfetched.
1,Another like the rest
1,This story was more a rough draft than anything that should have been published. First thing, the two men, we know they're ex-Seals, but we have no idea what they REALLY do for a job in this book (security?), how they came there, and what POSSIBLE interest they have in Christina since she is skittish and phobic. Off the bat, they're trying to get in Christina's pants for a life time relationship... are you kidding me? Serious? All of a sudden they're flying from an unknown location to Chicago in their personal jet with a king size bed? Kidnap her dog? Its frustrating... this book was scattered in thought, execution and information.
1,It was ok.
1,It was enjoyable for the first 30% or so, thereafter not so much.  It's just the usual captive sex slave story; nothing to make me want to read it ever again; nothing to stand out from a million others.  The he. cries all over the place, and it's just too much.  She confused me, as I just couldn't figure her out, where she was coming from. The Alp is hot and cold; tough and then not.  He is never consistent, and is pretty soft at times.  He lets his brother push him around, telling him what to do, and it comes across as if he is totally scared of him.  Not how I like my Alps to behave.		The characters left me pretty cold; I did not like any of them.  The writing is just okay.  The pace is slow at times, and I found lots of it boring; I had to grit my teeth to finish it. It also didn't seem right  to me that the slaves were branded with tattoos (the meaning of which were not explained) BEFORE being sold??  That scene made little sense for me, as I wasn't sure what the point of it was. The only sex scene that I found remotely hot and delicious, was at the beginning, thereafter, I found them all repetitive and 'same-old'.  Won't be bothering with the next two in the series; life's too short.
1,Many authors are re-releasing their older works in digital format, so this may have been written some time ago.  As the title says, this is episodic - so what's the difference between episodes and a series?  Episodes don't tell a complete story.  You need to get the next in the one episode to find out what happens next - and that won't be the end of the story either.  Additionally, the dialog of the characters doesn't match the time period in which the story takes place.  The dialog is twenty-first century, but the story takes place at the beginning of the 20th century.
1,So unrealistic!  Could not keep up with the true character of the book at any real time. Also a little to sadistic for me.
1,Scorchingly hot??  I think there must be a couple, maybe 3, graphic sex scenes but they were not scorching neither all that hot. Writting sex scenes in which graphic details are given don't make a book become an erotic (or scorchingly hot) book.		Almost everything in this book is so forced and far fetched that most of the times I felt what I was reading was ridiculous. After reading this short story I'm still not sure if the problem is that the plot, dialogues and characters are so over the top cliched that the whole story feels silly or if the author was trying to make this a kind of sexy-romantic-humorous read (do you know the ones I mean?) and it just happened that her sense of humour was not my cup of tea AT ALL.		Many times while reading this book I've felt like if they were 2 different authors, one of them being a really amateurish and juvenile one and the other one being a better writter (even if quite a sappy one).		I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because I finished it (it's pretty short) and also beacause the typos and mistakes were very, very few.		***SPOILERISH***		The female lead in this story is a very tired old cliche: fat lady, dorky, low slef-steeme, no luck with guys but... oh! so sweet, kind and generous. The male lead is... gorgeous? not much too say about him as the character is absolutely flat. And then we have the "evil sister" who is so over-the-top in her evilness, bitchiness and snottyness that you can't believe that a serious writter has tried to pull a character such as her into a book meant for adults!!		And the ending...oh my gosh! I wanted to gag! One thing is a Happy Ever After and other thing is this... I don't even have words for this cheesy sickeningly sweet and happiest than happy ending.
1,Way too much sex and not enough plot.  I would have liked more suspense after the office manager got canned and what her reactions were.
1,I hate to say this,  but this book was disappointing,  at best.  I am a huge fan of Amanda M. Lee,  but this book was a chore to read and I knew the ending by the third chapter.  It read like a cookie cutter of past work with more then a bit of juvenile,  think middle school,  snark and sarcasm.  The whole "mine" thing was over done and just plain ICK.  I had been looking forward this book,  but,  in all honesty,  The ending could not come quick enough.  I really enjoy this author's work but this book was just drivel with the snark and sarcasm that missed humorous by mile.  I hope this book was an exception and not the new norm.  Please find a way to go back too funny instead of juvenile delinquent wanna be,  I would recommend fans to skip this book and hope that future books go back to past greatness.
1,I read this story more to find out what it is like when two guys are a couple.  Not too impressed.
1,I am not normally one to write reviews. I love to read and be drawn into the story and feel an "aahh" when done. From the start of this story I felt like I was reading a personal diary. The characters seemed to be reciting, almost like reading a report of what happened. I honestly struggled reading the book, I gave up at chapter 6.  I believe the intent of the story is great and delightful characters but I didn't feel drawn into their persons, wanting to feel what they were feeling, the true, intense desire/love that they found in each other. I got this book free so I didn't feel too disappointed at not finishing.
1,SPOILERS  SPOILERS SPOILERS	Charlie is the ex porn star turned construction worker. Leo owns the company Charlie works for. Something horrendous happened to Charlie 4 years ago and he quit the porn industry. He left Florida and ends up in Nevada. Leo's ex boyfriend decides his big time law career in NY is more important than Leo and drops him like a hot potato. Both men are hurt and still healing.	Now this might have been an ok read if it was a full novel and the story was more fleshed out but it's too short and just a bunch of ideas thrown together. The nightmare that Charlie endured was not addressed in an appropriate manner and justice wasn't received. When Brian said to Leo that rape fantasy was a big turn on I couldn't believe Ms. Calmes would write such tripe. I almost left this as a DNF but I hoped it would be redeemed somehow and it wasn't. This alone had me take off 2 points. I didn't feel any chemistry between the two MC'S. It's a mess. Leo's sister is divorced from Leo's business partner. The business partner wants his ex-wife back. The ex-wife is apparently dating a big time abusive loser which is only thrown in to cause drama and pave the ex's back together. Who knows it's never resolved. Leo's ex comes back with a fiance that it doesn't appear he's happy with and they suggest Leo and the ex have sex with the fiance watching. More drama. Leo's ex's parents are thrown in with mom hating Leo, dad liking Leo. Why do we need this in such a short story? DRAMA! I'm a big Mary Calmes fan but this book is just a big drama filled mess. I'm sorry that I wasted my money and time. Won't recommend this book.
1,My son recommended this book, but it was to strange and disjointed for me. I like to relax when I read.
1,Okay, not my cup of tea but was interesting enough to read, wanted to know about the fifth beauty. Recommend for adult readers.
1,this was a poor book compaired to the first one.i really enjoyed first book but the author must have forgotten his own story. it felt that different from the first book.
1,A fast read with a sweet story.  Fun escape into a light hearted romance.  I give it two stars. Yay
1,Made absolutely no sense!  Just plain stupid.
1,I was really hopefull, I read the first one in the series hoping that number two would be stronger.  It really wasn't, If you are a fan of the alpha male then this guy is not for you, he came accross as weak, weak emotions, his feelings for the female lead did not impact at all.  Disappointed sorry.
1,1. Getting tired of the billionaire, gazillionaire thing. This isn't the authors fault...a money making trend is a money making trend. Am just wishing there were a little more originality going on.	2. The hero was a weak, weak man. Catch your wife in the middle of sexing her masseuse and still having thoughts about takin her back? Supposed to be in love with the heroine but has sex with the haggy wife? Shouting out your baby mamas name during the climax doesn't make it look better.	3. Guy was a hypocrite. I'm not a prude; I can deal with the adultery (once) but then he continually slobbers over the girlfriend and is offended to find out his wife is a tramp. Really?	4. Did I mention he was aa weak puss?	5. Would talk about the heroine but don't remember much about her. Besides the beginning of the book when we saw a little bit of her personality by the middle of the book she was almost a side character with little to nothing to say.	This book had potential.. I don't need a super alpha male but I had no sympathy for his continuous door matness.
1,This book uses diseases and shock therapy or try and get you to quit. It also advises nicotine replacement therapy. Which is pretty useless in quitting.
1,this could have been a great read..but it was way too short.  the author did not respect her readers enough to flesh out interesting characters and write a book..instead she gave us a tease..not a completed story. no more of this author for me.
1,Was that really only 20 pages? I know I have my text set fairly large to make reading comfortable but this felt like it went on forever! Every story ended with us, the human race, ending. One story, one, where facing certain doom everyone works to together to deal with the giant asteroid about to destroy the world. Moments after dealing with that we're looking for something else to blow to smithereens. Not one story ends happily. Not one future is bright. Thankfully it was short because it was depressing. You'd think an author could envision on good future. It doesn't even have to be perfect just better than the road we're speeding down now. But no. The futurd according to Rob Kutner is fairly horrible. Now I need something upbeat to pull me out of the rut this dug.
1,I've read The Prince over a dozen times and am absolutely insulted by this book and all that it is. I don't know where to begin with my reasons not to read... The author takes a wonderful piece of writing and takes out all of the original historical references Machiavelli uses in the letter -not book, the letter that would BECOME a book- and by taking out these historical references he is taking away from the person behind the writings. He is taking away from the letter and teachings of Machiavelli's when he takes away the historical mentions and references in the book not to mention he also removes the world in which Machiavelli lived and made him believe and think as he did. At one point the author states, "Secondly, you must be willing to accept that what Machiavelli teaches against the norms and values of many cultures." AS WITH ANY BOOK WRITTEN WHERE OPINIONS AND BELIEFS ARE GIVEN! So if the reason a reader hasn't read The Prince actually is because they cannot tolerate differences in Machiavelli's beliefs or opinions, this only reveals a very narrow minded reader and a person who has a limited reading list, anyway. Simplifying a book in attempt to not 'offend' anyone is insanity...... Machiavelli's reasons matter, and so does the history that he includes in his work-not only because it shows us why he believed and wrote all he did, but because it is based on MACHIAVELLI writings, rewording the work seems an easy way to make a buck; not to mention highly disrespectful to all other authors and artists. Stealing other peoples work is not cool. And that's all he's done; He has stolen another authors work and simplified it. To me, as an artist and writer, there is little else one could do that I'd find more deplorable. I'd give zero if possible.
1,This book, in my opinion is more a collection of facts about different things, than it is actual science. It goes over the planets, different animals of the sea, desert, and woodland. It was informatory, but again, I wouldn't consider it a science book. Maybe a book of facts would be more accurate. Most of the things in this book, my 3rd grader learned in 2nd or even 1st grade. There are a couple pages AFTER each section where kids can "write down" other animals that live in those areas, or even "write down" the order of the planets closest to the sun, but how are they supposed to do that on a kindle? The purpose of a kindle book is to NOT have the paper book, so that's kind of redundant, I thought. I wouldn't print this out just for my kids to be able to write down and answer the question. My 3rd grader, who is 9, almost 10, as well as my 2nd grader, 7, almost 8, both seemed pretty bored with the book & when asked if they liked it, their reply was, "Well, it didn't teach me anything I didn't know..." I received this book in exchange for my honest opinion. This does NOT change my review one bit.
1,There should have been warning about the language. Trashy. Didn't even bother after the first page. Good thing I didn't waste money on it.
1,Slow. This was meant for people who like a lot of buildup without a lot of bang. This was my first time reading a book in this genre. I deserved better. Maybe next time I should ask for dinner first so it's not a total loss.
1,I will start out by saying I hadn't read the first book, so that might influence some of my opinions.	Overall, I got the feeling the author just watched a lot of Sons of Anarchy and didn't do much more	research. All of the characters came off pretty two dimensional, and the interactions between the	two main characters were just sort of odd considering the circumstances of the story.		Honestly, I'll be deleting this from my kindle. I wanted to like it, because I really enjoy books about people in	unusual parts of society...but this just didn't come off as genuine.
1,This book was dumb!!!! Just a bunch of rambling that was not well thought out. It was almost like they were trying to make the book longer so they started trying to add in a lot of foolishness.
1,got bored of the game.
1,Ford and Grace were pretty much cookie-cutter characters in a formula romance.  It wasn't a terrible book, but it was slow and predictable. I'm glad it was free.
1,This book was so ridiculous, I returned it within 10 minutes of downloading it.  We all know it's a fantasy but how can you have your main character go from completely unaware of supernatural beings to picking out a nightgown?  Seriously, it was like reading a book where a couple of chapters were missing.  No story telling ability or creating of a character whatsoever.  What book were the rest of you reading?
1,Hard to appreciate a craft book without pictures.  I followed the links to see images all the crafts and got tangled up in a "download a free book" maze that was perplexing and felt like a trap.  I clicked through twice to make sure I had the right website.  "No", I don't want a NEW book when I can't read the book I just downloaded.  Kindle books such as this one that rely on images to tell the story (or show how to make something) are irritating, the click thru to see the pics almost always has a gimmick.  Not trustworthy.
1,I nearly stopped reading the book after a chapter or two, not my type and was frustrated 'cos couldn't work out where it was going. But curiosity made me finish! I enjoyed the dialogue of the different characters. A nice holiday read, if you're in the mood for abortion, murder and unpleasant characters.
1,I read revues of this book that it was a "really good book" but the whole book felt rushed. Then there were many mistakes in it. Even a non professional editor would have picked them up. The story fortune most part was a good idea if it was not so rushed.
1,The first book in the series was pretty good it has been all downhill since then. These books are getting progressively worse, with the primary focus being a free-love world told in a rambling, never getting to the point story, with an occasional mention of wizardry and swordplay.  The characters hop in and out of bed with any and everyone they happen across and never show a hint of jealousy.  The main character happens to be a wizard so I guess that is why this poorly written porn script is allowed to masqeurade as a sword and scorcery fantasy novel.		Making it even more stupid is the dialogue (how many wizards talk about 'cool' and 'awesome' stuff) and the ridiculous use of 'he/she stuck out his/her tongue' (three times on ONE chapter, at least a score of times in the book).		I guess I have made it to the fourth book in this series because they are free to Amazon Prime members, but every time I finish one of these books, I still feel like I got ripped off.
1,first of all, waist not waste, your not you're, and capital not capitol. I don't know how I finished this book. it's not that Interesting and it just seems off. is this what real life is like? Why are they so fixated on others when they are practical strangers? also if you're going to put a book online, proofread.
1,I have no sympathy for dishonesty so i just couldn't read this book.  A woman's pride basically so selfish it almost seems evil.  I realized how judgemental I am  as I couldn't stand the fact Malia lied to her son, hid from her lover while jeopardiizing her son's future with her dishonesty.  I don't care it has  HEA ending.  A women who manipulates, hides and lies doesn't deserve it.  Yuck.		And Brad, ever hear of private detectives?  And you are a lawyer?  How incompetent is that?  Pining away for 17 years?  Really?		Both of thm- TSTL.		I love Helen Conrad's books- but not this one.
1,I will not waste any more time with this series. In Fact i just listed mine on eBay. Lack of plot, chacter development, and background. I would read the Fallen series instead.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Fallen/dp/B004Z4LXS0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fallen</a>
1,I find the 5 star reviews of this book a 'bit' unbelievable and I couldn't sit here and let it go without posting what I think. I find the whole book hard to follow. Mostly because everything is written back to front - the ingredient first, then the amount. Things like 'chopped red onion, 1 piece', is very confusing - one piece of red onion? - 'red bird's eye chilies, ends trimmed, roughly chopped, 4 pieces', what is that? 4 tiny pieces of chili or 4 chilies? The directions are not very clear, then it doesn't say how much each recipe makes. How many jars do I need to prepare? You can't just pull them out of the cupboard they need to be sterilised. The whole process is not dealt with properly. I'm glad I got it for free and I'm not game to try a recipe I think I'd be wasting my time and resources, I seriously doubt they've been tested in a kitchen.
1,Horrible editing!
1,The first 10 chapters appeared to have been written by a teenager and for a teenager. The author used words and phrases not used in the regency period throughout the book as well as changing perspectives. The middle of the book was boring and just when I finally plowed through to the end, she put as a final zinger graphic descriptions of sex. Never saw that coming. This book was so bad, I am removing it from my Kindle.
1,This is not a book, it is a pamphlet. Here is the best piece of REAL advice on how to save money: Don't spend it, especially on this so-called book.
1,while i have no issues with gay relationships i don't need details. i know some do and i wish that had been mentioned in the description
1,It was light enjoyable teadibg
1,I was frustrated reading this one. I enjoyed the plot, it was interesting but it's like this book was only halfway finished. First off, as in the title there's supposed to be two Dome in this story. By 50% I was wondering if it was a misprint because we don't meet Ian until after that. He literally has no place in the book until the last half! AND, we discovered absolutely NOTHING about him in the book. I'm not even kidding. Zero. How the check did Liz fall for him? They never seemed to have a connection. It was never formed. Another thing that took away from the story is the overdramatic vernacular the author used when the main characters were conversing. It was ridiculous! No one actually speaks like that in real life. It really took away from the story. And there were too many unanswered questions and plot holes. Very disappointing.
1,The book had 2411 locations on my kindle.  The book was about a woman, named Jackie and a man, named Daniel. Jackie was a grown woman, with 2 adult sons. Daniel was Jackie's brother in law. Jackie's husband and Daniel's wife were murdered in a boating explosion. The book contained some so, so sex, oral sex, anal sex scenes and a bit of boring suspense. The book also contained some spankings with hands and a brush. The age play in the book, was very minor. Daniel called Jackie "Cookie and Young lady", but other than that, not much. I really did not like the fact, that the relationship between Daniel and Jackie happened toooo quickly. They were separated for 5 years, but kept in touch, after the death of their spouses, The moment, they meet again, they instantly start a relationship and have sex. I wanted more, of the forbidden "He's my husband's brother, maybe we shouldn't do this, but no. Instant couple. The children, automatically accepted the fact, that their mother and uncle were together. They fell in love too quickly and the  book just dragged on, and on from this point. I have read some wonderful age play erotica and this was not the worst, but I felt like, it could have been much better. I can't believe, I paid $4.99 for this book:(
1,Billionaire who is a party animal, who thought he got this bimbo girl friend pregnant the first time night they where intimate. Just unbelievable.
1,I loved the Andrades families epic but got a little confuse with the uncle's wives Victor wife is not Elise if I remember correctly.
1,I was disappointed with this book.  It did not hold my interest at all.  I did not even finish reading this book.  I did not like the characters.
1,No pude terminar de leer de lo aburrido
1,Did not make it over 30 pages ... Love the Kindle delete button ...
1,Amazon canceled the kindle??
1,Yeah he invited his ex to the wedding.  Why?  Never discovered that.  Also why was he making out with said ex? As someone else commented: why would the author even involve the ex's in this story if the situations weren't going to be resolved.  That was very annoying.  He just wanted her to trust him on things and accept, but what he was asking was what she had lived with all her life and she didn't want a life like that.		He wants to continue to party but not take his wife along for the ride.  He keeps saying it's in the past don't let it color the future.  Everything that happened to them in the past affects their future as well as present.  He claims that his family life isn't relevant to his life now, but his whole mindset was from the past and I find it hard to believe that as a two year old he would have had that type of mindset.  Easier to believe it of Francesca.  Given his explanation it didn't seem to wash because frankly had she taken the time, by investigating things, she could have discovered that her father had a similar story too.  So because of his his past he had "short-term relationships with air-heads who couldn't possibly match (his) intellect, or interest (him) in any way other than physically. . . ".  But for some reason he remained friends with these women and would even go out with them.  That would imply that their relationships were more than just physical it would mean that he enjoyed their company.  (ex at the wedding; other woman at the night club two nights in a row when he claimed to be working)		She wanted him to find her sexy and she wanted that passionate connection with him but because of the past (when he was two) he withheld that from her.		Repetitive phrases:  stabbing his fingers through his hair and always saying he is Sicilian.  That got a bit ridiculous!  Who says that?		Hero was all wishy washy: he claims that no man in their right mind would claim to understand the workings of a woman's mind and yet you catch him thinking to himself that he was always arrogantly, confident in his ability to understand women.  I liked that he NEVER really knew her at all let alone understood her.  He tried to catergorize her with the other women from his past.  I liked that she did stand up to him in some aspects.  And it brought him up short near the end when he was convinced that she would tell him she loved him . . . only she didn't!		When they were having it out in one part he says that the only woman he has slept with since their wedding is you (Francesca).  Um . . . but they didn't even sleep together then either.  Their wedding was 6 months before and she had run away on that day because of him and his ex kissing "passionately".  Then on the very next page he says that he hadn't slept with another woman since she returned to Sicily.  Problem being that would imply that from their wedding until the day she returned he did sleep with other women.		Oh yeah he was clueless.  He was worried about their pic showing up in the papers when he carried his wife out of the nightclub yet he didn't stop to think that his picture was carried on the tv's when he was out with other women.  There was never really any good satisfactory explanation to that.  Frankly one would believe a woman with self esteem issues wouldn't want to see her husband with another woman and yet she didn't throw much of a fit about it.		Why didn't she call him out more for the exes and his behavior?  I can't get past that contradictory statement that he made nor the fact that he invited an ex to the wedding and he was seen kissing said ex.  On their wedding day!  He tries to tell Francesca that the other women were jealous because she married him but they didn't know she heard them.  Instead she decides to find him and speak to him about it only she found him kissing his ex.  He tells her that a "relationsip based on respect and understanding is far more successful than one based on physical lust."  So I'm guessing getting caught kissing another person on your wedding day AFTER exchanging vows (not that it's a good idea to be doing it before) is a sign of respect to the person you just wed.		I truly believe she had it right all along when she accused him of not doing anything unless he gained something from it and right up to the ending he stood to gain.  It wasn't a very satisfactory read because I was left with questions and didn't fully trust him because of them.
1,But let me explain I hate a one dimensional story. Introduce me to all the characters not just the heroine. Who by the way was the most skittish and most irritating lead I've read about in some time. The things these kids accomplished at their age was astonishing and ridiculous. SN: I didn't like another book by this author therefore I need to compile a list of authors to NEVER read. She would make the top 5.
1,The book overall had a good plot and story line but the love between the two main characters was beyond unrealistic. A couple of bouts of sex does not a relationship make. Beyond the sex the two characters conversations indicated nothing that would lead the reader to believe that the declarations of love the two charscters repeatedly professed were in any way true. However if what you're looking for is an okay plot with good characters but no emotion and a couple of sex scenes then by all means, read on. But if at least some element of believable love or even just caring is required for you to enjoy a book, then this is not the book for you.
1,I read these three one after the other.  The plots were too similar to each other.	After recently reading several books where standard English was not in evidence, I found the first of these three refreshingly absent of major errors.  However, it went down hill. In books 2 and 3. There were subject and object pronoun errors. He and him are not interchangeable, nor are she and her, they and them, etc.	  In book three there were sudden jumps from one couple's story to another couple's past.  This continued for the remainder of book 3.  I assume those relationships were brought up to set the stage for the following books in the series.	 A hook or lure is not needed if the writing is well done and the series is good enough to hold a reader's interest.	Each book leaves a few loose ends which were addressed in the next book.  Not quite a CLIFF HANGER formula, but very close.	I was not hooked into looking for the next book(s) in this series.
1,No lead-in explanation to introduce the goofy story. Author must have dreamed this one up when he was nursing a hangover! I had to force myself to finish this idiotic book. There was no explanation whatsoever for what took place in the book.  I do not believe I will ever attempt to read a BJ Knight book again. I deleted it right away!
1,The story started out fine, the. There were times where I was lost and confused as to what was really going on.
1,Years ago, when my husband and I were young and had time for such things, we used to enjoy something called Good Wine/Bad Movie night. It was exactly as the name implies. We would take turns picking out a good bottle of wine and a bad movie. The idea being the better the wine was, the worse the movie could be. We had a lot of fun on such nights. You couldn't take the drack we were watching seriously (serious B grade sci-fi was a favourite), but when paired with high quality alcohol you would have been laughing at it too. It was fun.		If Dark Indiscretions was a movie, it would have been a prime contender to pair with an excellent Ctes de Bordeaux. It's bad. I mean, really bad. The only reason I'm not giving this a one star is because it's so bad it trips over into the 'so super-bad it's funny' category and since I'm the sort who enjoys staying awake to watch the cheesy late-night fantasy fair I actually got a kick out of this.		I cringed at the writing. The dialogue just about killed me. The plotting was a disaster. The editing was MIA. The character development was nonexistent. The sex was brutally blunt, brusque even. The POVs and tenses were erratic at best. But it was like a train wreck I just couldn't look away from. Not once did I consider putting it down and not finishing it. I was too busy being amused at it's horridness.		I highlighted a number of examples that I had intended to include here, but I think at this point it might just seem cruel. Instead, I'll just suggest looking up the notes and highlights. And despite my assertion that the book is a rolling disaster, I'd still recommend it to people like me who enjoy a good cheese-fest on occasion, maybe a little WTFery thrown in on the side. This is the book for you.
1,inventive but improbable situation and premise.  One dimensional characters, setting and scope.  Ok for a bath and an adult beverage.
1,When the book opens, I'm presented with three links: one for the body of the book, one for the abbreviations used, and one for an explanation of the edition.		Unfortunately, the link to the body of the book is dead. Of course, this renders the entire file useless.  Why this wasn't caught and corrected right away, I can't fathom.  I'm using a Kindle Fire HD, so it may work fine for other Kindles.
1,Gift ~ Will try this again...
1,I forced myself to read six chapters of the first book, trying to get past the dialogue, but I couldn't go any farther. The banter between the characters is extremely simple, as if written by a young teen or child. It seems highly unlikely to me that Hip (as 'ancient' as he is) would think a mortal 14 year old girl was 'amazing' or that he would say things like "are we going to make out now?"	I tried to get into the story, but was not in any way drawn in enough to continue. The first star is for the author accomplishing a publication, the second is for the lack of type-o' s (at least I didn't see many of them).
1,I will admit to being disappointed. I read this story for two reasons. First the hero and heroine stay faithful to each other including during a long seperation. There are not many second chance romances that include that element and since I always want the hero and heroine to only be with each other after meeting and so that was a draw for me. Second it included a forbidden romance elements of teacher & student and younger man & older woman. The story had the things referenced above and the reason it was a 2 star review as opposed to a 1 star one.		The main problem I had with the story is that it was boring. Conflict easily resolved very quickly and early in the story. Nothing much really happened. Also the smex scenes were medicore and lacking in passion.  It probably would have helped to keep things interesting and make it more steamy if more time was spent in the past when they had their forbidden relationship. Sadly that was not the case. The majority of the story was in the present.
1,I bought this book because I'd just read a wonderful novel by the author, K. C. Wells, "Making It Personal".		Sadly, I was disappointed. In fact, it's hard to believe this was written by the same author.		The biggest problem, for me, was the same noted by other reviewers: who ARE these gays guys? Never, ever, have I encountered gay men so totally lacking in testosterone. In fact, I couldn't help thinking, this is not a house of gay men, it's the home of a gaggle of teenage girls.		Every time they leave the house, it seems, they're wearing skin-tight leather pants, flattering silk shirts, clear lip gloss and eyeliner - to bring out the color of their eyes. Not to mention that much of the book is about "girly" things including the most minute details of a wedding and the constant discussion of feelings. Ah, I get it now, this was a gay romance written for teenage girls? That must be it.		The problem is that, as an adult gay male, I found the dialog downright silly, at times. As others have mentioned, how many groups of gay men do you know who refer to each other, constantly, as "sweetie", "honey" and walk around telling each other how hot they are, constantly kissing each other on the cheek, head and lips?		I guess if you're a gay-curious teenage girl, this book may be for you. It certainly wasn't for me.		And it's a shame because the author is a talented writer and the book deals with several important issues, including gay-bashing and childhood sexual abuse.		And one personal note to the author: If you're going to write about gay men having sex, please, at least, get the anatomy right. When a man is on his back, his prostate is up, not down.
1,I'll preface this review by acknowledging that writing takes a lot of courage and  I respect that.  The premise for this story is captivating.  The actual words used ( several sentences in a row start off, "I...") lack that special quality that grabs the reader.  I received this book as a gift in exchange for an honest review.
1,I didn't enjoy it much as I felt it skip all over the place to much.  It had a good plot but you had to work top follow it.  It din't work or read smoothly.
1,A Tale of Two Cities is my least favorite book by Charles Dickens. The writing was dull and boring. When I heard that this book is a retelling of A Tale of Two Cities, I immediately requested this book on Netgalley and hoped that this book will help me be interested to reread A Tale of Two Cities. This book was very faithful to the story, but it did not spark my interest in A Tale of Two Cities. Rather, it is a story that I will still avoid. I felt that Tell the Wind and Fire was not a very developed world. I am still confused about the Light and Dark of New York City. There is no explanation to how these people got magic. For instance, some had magic, but Ethan did not. Why did some people have magic and some did not? I also felt that there was no character development with Ethan and Lucie. They were very bland. The only character I thought was interesting was Carwyn, and he soon came across as annoying. I think this story would have been better if had the main character not been on Lucie because I did not like being in her head. I also found the story to be very boring because it is not until the last few chapters that it picked up speed. Still, I think this book will appeal to younger readers who have to read A Tale of Two Cities in school. After all, I would rather read this than Charles Dickens.	(Note: I read an ARC copy of this book in courtesy of Netgalley.)
1,Fun story starting but, if course, you have to buy another book if you are into those...I'm not.	I'm the person that gains a TUDE because nothing was stated about leaving a person to hanging at the end.	Though we can assume what happens, it was a start to a fairy good story...His Grace hasn't got a chance!
1,Couldn't finish....
1,Ick!  Ian sank to a new level of low by having carnal knowledge of both his fated mate and that mate's twin, who, even worse, turned out to be his Beta's/best friend's fated mate. While fate/destiny/life happens as it may, personal actions guide end results, and Ian was nothing but selfish, nasty and cruel to people who deserved, at minimum, decent treatment, especially Breaker, who would have given Fisk to Ian had he but truly wanted him.  In this book, Ian continues as the spoiled malcontent he portrayed in book 3, only he knows it isn't right, and he knows Seb doesn't deserve such dishonorable treatment.  His cavalier carelessness with other people's feelings completely out me off this book, and I skipped around to catch bits and pieces until Seb got the happy ending he richly deserved.  Circumstances placed him and his twin in the dire straits they were forced into, and while they deserved strong, honest mates who could take care of them, NO ONE deserves to be manipulated, or taken advantage of, especially sexually, even if it was done prior to Ian's awareness, recognition, and acceptance of Sebastian as his mate.		I just could not enjoy the past two books - I guess I simply do not like Ian.  The author could have set this up differently - I find it difficult to believe any self-respecting individual - in this case two identical individuals - would accept Ian's behavior.  I also don't buy Breaker's calm forgiveness.  The knowledge that my man got it on with my best friend before, DURING AND AFTER our own relationship would KILL any commitment.  Period.  Unrealistic, dreadful theme.  1/2 star.
1,Sigh.... Another cliffhanger....  I honestly wish this author would respond to my question. These 2 books are 100 pages, why break this book up with cliffhangers?  Why not just finish it in 1 book? These authors are beginning to get out of control with these unnecessary cliffhangers. When we pay for a book we expect a complete product or is that expecting too much these days?		These characters, (I can't remember the age of the 2 characters, mid to late 20s I believe) are immature. Both books are basically one whole miscommunication nightmare. They're best friends but can't express how they feel. The female character, is a liar throughout the whole book, even Nick called a liar. Lol I'm sorry, but adults don't act that way. The younger sister was more mature than Charlotte. This book was annoying. It start out okay the first 20% of the first book, which is why I gave it a 2 star rating. I won't won't finish this series, because of the cliffhangers and the annoying characters. I wouldn't recommend this book for someone to read.
1,I started the book and it just wasn't my cup of tea. Even if the detective is a lesbian I would just get to the detecting part and not care about her personal love life. I am sure this fills someone's favorite catagory, just not mine.
1,Author completely blows over almost everything interesting about the 'married guy falls for anther guy' scenario. No depth in the character. Very little inner monologue on decisions. Read like cruddy 'insta love' fan fiction.  Sex scenes were just dumb and lacked any nuance.
1,From the cover, Legend of the Stone Chapter 1 looked like an interesting science fiction short story, and as I love science fiction and fantasy, I jumped at a chance to read this. I should have paid more attention to the description. If I had, its poor writing and poor grammar would have tipped me off that the book would be equally bad.		The story focuses on Lucas, a being of sorts, (we are never told exactly what he is) who is tortured his whole life, until he decides to break out of prison, which coincides with the collision of a meteor into the military base itself. Lucas helps others (Projects) like him escape, but fails to get away himself. He manages to escape the base, and finds some special, magical rock, and wanders on the moon before falling unconscious when his spacesuit runs out of air. At this point, Lucas is rescued by the old man and they talk before realizing that they need to get away before the authorities arrive. The book ends with them reentering the damaged military base to steal some keys and a ship.		The book had an interesting concept and could have been an exciting and gripping tale of one mans escape after being locked up and tortured for an untold number of years. Too bad the atrocious writing, the constant use of the wrong word, and the unclear writing style (Lucas was dazed because he was unconscious.) made the book almost impossible to read. The list of problems could fill a book in and of itself, but I will try to be concise.		1. The prose of a third grader.		The writing left something to be desired. After the first few paragraphs, it became clear that the author could not form a proper sentence, nor write above the third grade level. His punctuation is amateurish, as his writing showcases that he is unable to properly punctuate sentences. He places periods in the middle of what should be a complete sentence, neglects to use a comma to separate differing clauses and prepositional phrases, adds exclamation points in an effort to make his writing exciting (something that is never acceptable in prose unless it ins dialogue, or you happen to be Tolkien), and puts question marks at the end of sentences that are not questions, but declarative. The prose is full of fragmented sentences and extraneous fluff that add nothing to the overall storyline.		For instance, there is a passage that reads: The old man could see the severity of the situation and decided to take Lucas back to the horizon he came from. Without artificial gravity that was standard throughout the colonies. The moons gravity made it easy for this old man to carry Lucas back to where the old man was from.		It continues its downhill trek from there. The next two paragraphs consist of the old man doing stuff and each complete sentence begins with the phrase the old man. It isn't until the next chapter that we learn his name is Juan.		A better way to write the above passage would be:		Seeing Lucas dire situation, the old man took pity on him and lifted him upthankful that the gravity on the moon was such that it allowed him to do soand carried the unconscious Lucas to his home.		Its more concise, easier to read, and more mature in its style.		2. Repetitive writing.		The repetitiveness made me want to jump out of my second story window. The writing consists of: Lucas did this. Lucas did that. Lucas did something else. And several more sentences that start with Lucas, or the name of some other character when a pronoun would have been appropriate. Not every sentence should have the structure of a noun, verb, period.		3. Uneven plot line.		There were many instances in this story where I had no idea what was happening, nor could I picture the scenery or action sequences.		It isn't made clear until Chapter 2 that the entire story takes place on the moon.		When we get to the old mans home, I, at first, thought that it was a single dwelling. It wasn't until two chapters later that the reader is informed that the old mans home is part of a huge complex. Why didn't the author tell us this in the first place? It felt as though that had been thrown in at the last minute.		During Lucas escape, we learn that he has metallic wings and if he had these metallic wings the whole time. If that was the case, why didn't he just escape earlier, instead of allowing the scientists to torture him for years and use him like a guinea pig? Also, where did the wings come from? Are they a part of his physical make-up? Or did he steal them while making his escape? The author failed to explain where Lucas got the wings, or how they fit into the story.		4. Unrealistic conversations and character action.		When we are introduced to Juan, the old man, we are never told why he is strolling on the moons surface in the first place, or happens to be passing by when he sees Lucas. In the next chapter Juan informs us that he heard about the attack on the military base and decided to go check it out for himself.		Lucas and the magic rock makes no sense either. He finds it during his escape, but there is no logical reason for him to take it. Most people are not going to be collecting rocks when they are being shot at and are trying to escape from captivity. Lucas reason for taking the stone is never fully explained.		The conversation between Juan and Lucas takes place over a course of three chapters. At first, Juan mentions that people are going to be looking for Lucas, since hes an escaped prisoner. Then we spend the next three chapters listening to them talk about the magic rock, how to take a martial art crap, philosophy, God, love, and human nature, before coming back to the part where Lucas is an escapee and they need to figure out how to avoid the authorities find them. This portion feels convoluted and it appears that the author forgot which story he was writing, or, at the very least, lost focus.		5. Differing tenses.		The prose flips back and forth between present tense and past tense. In many cases, the same sentence will start out in present tense, switch to past tense, before being thrust back into present tense. Hence the need for an editor.		6. The entire story is just one long laundry list of things to do.		The whole book consists of this person did this. This person did that. Then, this person did this. Now we have a magic rock. Now we are talking. This person is wise because hes old. You get the picture.		The action scenes read like a to do list. There is no suspense and I find myself not caring about the characters. Adding exclamation points does not make your writing engaging. It makes you look like an amateur and detracts from what should be a thrilling tale of escaping bondage. The authors disjointed writing style reminds me of the way my three-year-old niece tries to tell me a story: confusing, hard to follow, and full of tangents that have no bearing on the story itself and are distracting.		6. Not properly formatted		This book was not properly formatted for the kindle. The paragraphs suffer from exaggerated first line indents. Also, I cannot change the spacing or font like I should be able to. If a book is formatted correctly, you should be able to change the settings to your liking and the text should reflect that. Not so here. The text remains squished together, regardless of my kindles settings, making it difficult to read.		7. It resembles a draft of a draft, instead of a well-conceived and well-written story.		The story reads like a first draft. Its as though the author just typed it up in Word and didn't even bother to read through what he had written, but uploaded it and clicked publish. Its only 98 pages, yet the nonsensical writing, Jack and Jill vocabulary, and the constant flow of unrelieved streams-of-consciousness, with no evidence of working thought processes, style made me feel as though I was reading War And Peace.		8. Unedited material.		I know I mentioned this earlier, but it bears being said again: this book was not edited. From the first few pages, it is clear that the author not only failed to read through his own manuscript and edit it, but refused to hire and editor. A few misplaced commas I can deal with, but this went beyond that.		I know every author has a writing style, but this is not a writing style; this is just bad writing. I recommend passing on this one.
1,Did not finish, could not get into it.
1,I'm not even completely finished with this book, but if they change writers right now and suddenly the rest of the book becomes the thing from which all classics are born, I'd still only give it three stars.	There is so much back and forth dialogue that it sometimes gets confusing as to who is speaking.  There is so much nonsense that you don't realize something important is happening until it's already done.	 The author shows her ignorance of familial relationships. Or maybe the ignorance of the characters is in question here, because they got it right on the cover, but the child of the man that you are marrying is not your son-in-law, he is your stepson. The son of the man that your mother is marrying is not your brother-in-law , he is your stepbrother .  Omg can people ready be this dumb?	I'm now going to try to finish this book. If I'm wrong and it gets better, I'll let you know......
1,I couldn't finish, it was bad. Sorry to the author, but a lot of work needs to be done. The general foundation is here. But the sentences are SO simple, the dialog unrealistic, and just not well written at all.
1,Not what I was looking for...
1,Not fond of this.
1,The middle story was way too kinky for me, so I stopped in the middle. The first and last stories were way over the top sex with a few pages of plot.  The concept of the town was great and the first book had an excellent plot, but it seemed as though as sex scenes increased plot time diminished. I love paranormal romance and cops and firefighters but there wasn't enough story for me.
1,This book was painful to get through emotionally draining in its misery, disheartening. Even with the 'happy' ending, it left a feeling of dissatisfaction, emptiness.		Zack and Lydia were miserable together. Lydia was hostile, unpleasant, mean and dysfunctional. I understand Zack took as much as he did for the sake of his children and to keep as much peace as he could, but he ended up being Lydia's whipping boy.		Claire's brother and sister were selfish and useless. Claire was boring. Lydia got what she deserved. I was glad to see Amanda get far away from Nick.		I was glad to finally see good things happen for Zack, but by the time it happened, I was exhausted from wading through all the crap in his, Claire's, and Lydia's lives.		I disliked Lydia, didn't mind Zack, was indifferent to Claire. Although Claire and Zack had a relationship, I felt no connection between them. The sex scenes were even blah. Nothing in this book made me want to revisit the author's writing.
1,Yeah, I don't know. This was kind of a mess. It started off okay, but then it got a little slow, and then it got a little ridiculous. There were a lot of pieces here, and not only did they not come together, but most of them didn't matter at all. The drama was very high, but not in a good way. More in a forced way that made the whole thing feel dated, like bad soap opera. (God I miss my soaps.) Won't harp on everything that made this not good for me. If you aren't already a fan of the author, then I don't recommend this book for you.
1,I liked the book at the beginning however it lost me when Darcy decides he should end it with Elizabeth. One of the best qualities about Mr. Darcy is his unquenchable love for Elizabeth Bennet. For him to want to back out after their engaged seemed appalling to me.
1,Obviously author is full of some SEO techniques and does not really care about the reader. I bought this book, when I opened to read it - surprise!!! it's not on my iPad. Why? because the title was changed. I had to download a browser reader to be able to look through it. I read it in 3 minutes. Wasted more time to get it opened that it took me to read It's more like a blog post with no valuable info whatsoever. Save your money.
1,I couldn't finish this one. I had to struggle through the first trilogy but I prodded on with this one till the last book before tossing it. None of the characters are interesting or likable. By book three you are at least committed to the characters who have been the entire series main focus but they're gone from book three. Just flew off into the vacuum I guess, who knows what became of them. The only person carried over into book three is Colden and I couldn't stand her in book two. Now she's the main character and I dislike her even more. I don't care what happens to anyone. I kept putting the book down for days at a time, then a week, then the last attempt to read it I had forgotten the names of all but Elfrida and Jun from the last books. The entire thing was weird and boring, disjointed and irritating. Not a page turner. Scrap it.
1,The usual strong, handsome rich but of course unhappy man, the struggling, honest but of course unhappy woman.  This book has been written a dozen times under different titles, but it never changes.
1,Somewhat disjointed writing made this story hard to follow. I kept feeling that I was missing something. The words used in some places were wrong. The sentence structure was also incorrect.  A good editor could have turned this around. Then the oddness of the tale would stand out rather than the presentation.
1,I downloaded Book 1 for free, and was pretty impressed with Evans' writing, so I bought Book 2. However, I felt really let down. It seemed that there was a lot of meandering around, and that Evans hadn't taken the time to properly edit her book. For instance, Chapter 15 on my K3 was underlined all the way through! There were also numerous spelling and grammatical errors. The formatting at the end was abrupt and seemed like Evans had just gotten tired of writing and wanted to wrap up.		The plot was also not as interesting as the first one. This time, it seemed that Piper talked an unhealthy amount about her metabolism and junk food (almost on every page) and there was a part where she went off about the death penalty and murder that I found utterly confusing. It was almost like reading an opinion piece.		*Spoiler* Also, it seemed convenient that the witch in the book could use his powers when he wanted to do virtually anything, and yet sent Piper on a wild goose chase simply to confuse her and get her executed. Why couldn't he have just staged HER killing to look like someone else had done it and then used magic to deflect anyone off the right path? And the lie detector kid...why did he not see the sword the first time around, while they were in his house? Utterly confusing and not explained.		I hope Evans has a professional content and line editor look at her third book. I noticed in the acknowledgements that she had a friend (it seemed like) look over the 2nd one, but maybe a professional would be able to devote more time and energy towards making her books something readers would feel happy to spend their money on.		P.S. - Also, I believe the proverb is "When It Rains, It Pours" and not "It Never Rains But It Pours," so the title is sort of off, too.
1,Trying to understand the psyche of a person who claims to have been abused, is what someone would expect. Alas, this is not the case. The author just claims of getting as an adult a vague memory that he might have been abused as a child, and due to this -so called- revoked memory, he presents some (totally incoherent) phases of his adult life, interrupted with theatrical-like passages where he talks as an alter ego of himself. There's no start, mid or end part in this book, just a incoherent mumbling of why he cannot or can trust women, why, how, when, somehows and such. I'm more than glad that this didn't cost me any money as a kindle download... else I would be screaming for my wasted money.		I cannot say if the author has, or not, been abused as a child, but I can say that the book and the writing style makes no sense at all. To boot: A delirium incoherent self-chatter without a point...
1,At first I didn't like it. I didn't like the character of elyssa. She was mean and bossy and I felt the author was trying to hard to create conflict. But, the story was cute, , not very deep characters .
1,Wasn't even a whole book, what a waste of time
1,This was such a random trivia book filled with useless information. One useful piece of information that I learned was that Shakespeare did invent the knock knock joke long ago though.
1,This feels more like something you would find on a blog about the same topic. Sure, someone new to marketing their book might find a couple sites they didn't know about but it's not enough to validate spent money on. There are much better publications available for cheep or free, if you just take the time to look. While it's not worthless it's not worth a Hugh rating. I received an evaluation copy in exchange for my honest opinion, which may not mirror your own. No compensation has been or will be received beyond the evaluation copy.
1,Forget about suspense or ration thought process. Very predictable, author is just going for blood. My junior high students can write better mystery/suspense stories. Don`t waste your time or efforts reading this text.
1,Nothing special here. Very typical fare boy is rich, girl is not type thing. Nothing remarkable or noteworthy to mention. But lets just say while its not exactly a save your money. It's enjoyment factor  in the time it'll take to read is not worth it IMHO. It's just too predictable....
1,The characters fell in love the moment they saw each other even though one was married. Thankfully the wife was conniving so that was wrapped up nice and neat. Expect lots of foreplay with toys. I skimmed he whole book. I would not recommend.
1,I like Lori Brighton's writing. But I am so sick of vampires and was disappointed when I found that is what is in this book. It had a good story line though so if you like vampires you might enjoy this one.
1,Very poorly written book  - the author should be embarrassed at even writing or publishing this book- don't waste a penny on buying it....
1,This book was o.k I've read better books by this author..	The one book that I really enjoyed reading by K.S. Martin was	Her boss the alpha. At least that's what I think it's called. The only reason I am giving this book a two star rating is because it had a good plot line but the heroine is "so like high school". Collin s	Mom is mommy dearest, his oldest brother is psycho. And his other brothers are immature spoiled "men". And Collin is an ass. One min he goes straight for her sister and is so like disappointed that his mate isn't at all like he dreamed of. And when he found out her last name took her to his enemy PACK land and gave her no choice but be humiliated and made to feel less than. And wonders why she would not allowed him to claimed her. The only redeeming quality of this book was the kidnapping and rescue of the sisters. That's the only mild excitement in this story.
1,Should have been one book. Shame on you for having les than ten words on some pages.
1,It is awkward and difficult to write sex scenes for 5 males and one female.  The whole book is just...well awkward.  The characters are undeveloped as there is just so many of them that there is no real focus on the individual.  I also didn't understand why a grandma would be telling her grand daughter about her love life with her five husbands?
1,I, like many of the readers, had hoped that this book would add something more to the story - Something interesting, different and new ... but really, it was the same story.  There was a lot of going back and forth with his inner dialogue that frankly was hard to follow.  I'm all for sidebar, but this was "beyond the pale" .... see what I did there?  Anyway, I had hoped for more depth and maybe more stories from his prior relationships/subs/etc.  Add that to the fact that the first movie was so-so and the second doesn't come out until 2017?  I'm sorry, but this train will be long gone by then.
1,This does nothing more than briefly describe some of the equipment and weapons of the United States Army.  I would have gotten more from "Jane's".
1,I love mermen. Gay mermen...even better! Sadly this book is so typical that you can tell exactly what is about to happen. The characters are annoying and flat, the "plot" is dull and predictable, only thing it's got going is good cover art. Don't be fooled. Save your money
1,Boy, I certainly did not have the same response to this book as the other reviewers.  This is the first book by this author for me, so maybe it helps to have read others? It started out entertaining even though the dialogue was a little too stiff feeling for my preference.  Then she went to the aiport and picked up her sister who has Asperger's and it was a big ole thing that she couldn't hug her sister [I'm thinking they're adults, wouldn't this not-hugging thing be pretty much the norm by now?].  Then it's revealed her sister is pregnant and her only response is anger that sis was okay with some guy touching her but not her family touching her? [the little voice in my head's screaming, if you're going to jump to a conclusion wouldn't it be that sis was raped, given the Asperger's?].  But the final straw for me was the very next scene, in the airport parking lot her sis gets violently kidnapped and rather than worry over her sis, it's "witty" reparte and allusions to how hot her expartner is who she'll [angst-riddenly] have to contact for help.  Definitely not my cup of tea.  Stopped reading pretty much before I hit 25%.		In fairness, I've just read 4 extremely enjoyable, dare I say perfect books, so maybe my tolerance for anything less is miniscle right now.  Given that, plus the fact it's not terrible led to the two stars rather than one.
1,I have had this book a few years & I believed it was free read..  I am an avid reader that is very aware of horrible editing  & had Too many story lines that added to the confusion! This was  written bad with too  unfinished story lines, not even True possible scenarios of Street life.  Sometimes books are written with absurd ideas &  unbelievable situations  this book did all that  & would  just dropped the present scenario without completion.
1,I'm not sure exactly what to say except that this book was very....."odd" I guess is the best way to describe it.  Kinda creepy.  I didn't get very far because I thought a better use of my time would be to scrub the corners of my bathroom floor with a toothbrush.  mb
1,Way too much rambling. No real direction in the story. Didnt hold my interest.
1,One of these was enough.  There must be a formula for the author to follow when writing this type of novel.  Truely disappointing.
1,It took me four weeks to get through about 30% of this book and I'm officially giving up.		The writing is better than most NA but the characters and storyline are so boring. I couldn't even muster the energy to find the characters unlikable.		When I literally dozed off after their first night together, I knew I'd never make it through.
1,Not what I had in mind at all. I thought this was going to be like The End of Me by Tara Brown.
1,I read this out of order but this was way to rushed to feel like a book..  takes place over a 24 hour period.  the meet, have sex, separate, stuff happens, they get together, have sex, all's happy...so not worth the money and I liked the characters in the other book.
1,Okay, let me start out by saying this book is the same as all the other books by this Arthur. Even though I have only read two books of hers . However they all start out the same.  Her stores are all starting to sound like a one trick pony and it can be very boring after a while. So after reading to her books I will not be reading anymore books. It all starts out Richmand meets full figure woman falls in love instantly next thing you know they're in the bed. The sex is not all that exciting but hey I do appreciate new artist coming to Amazon with different books
1,This was just plain awful.
1,In this book, a gorgeous and horny guy meets a gorgeous and horny girl; an hour or so later, they are in bed; after the second round of sex, they both admit to themselves that it must be love; and three weeks later, they are engaged. What? How? Why? What?! They haven't even had a conversation yet, unless you consider grunting, moaning, and dirty talking a conversation. They are both supposed to be responsible adults, professional and successful, yet they behave like silly teenagers controlled by raging hormones, going for it on every surface in the house and out of it. Aren't they sore? Are they human? Don't they want to stop for a minute and go for a walk, or out to eat, or anything?		The writing is stiff; the storyline is so thin that it is practically nonexistent, and the descriptions are poor and few and far between. I couldn't even visualize the characters, let alone connect with them. I didn't care at all if Ailsa and Colin lived or died; in fact, I may have been happier with the latter. We are told that the story takes place in Scotland, but it can be on Mars for all we know. It is such a pity, too. Scotland is one of the most beautiful places on Earth, but we cannot see any of it. Actually, we are shown a very little of anything:  this book is just one unoriginal and poorly written sex scene after another, and there is not much in-between information.		I enjoy erotic novels and have read plenty of them. They make me feel alive and sexy. This book kept me uninterested and left me cold. While reading Hot Highland Fling, the one and only thing I anticipated was for the book to end. I couldn't wait to put it down, and I checked my progress after every press of the next-page button.		Even though this book was free, I've read some really good free books. This is not one of them. Keep looking.
1,I liked the fire between the two, the heat and how desperately in love he became in the end, it was so cute especially the stuttering . interested in the other brothers romance now too.
1,Started fairly well moved a long steady pace than I thought it everything got wrapped up and ended even that was cut short like the author stopped writing and ended the story, I was hoping for more
1,The author doesn't seem to have known much about the workings of the British navy during the Napoleonic era, or of naval ships of that time, which shows in quite a bit of misinformation on the book.	She also has trouble with her timelines with the characters, and the progression of the story..
1,Didn't like this I couldn't finish it.
1,This wasn't really a story. Not even a short story. It is an overview of a story. May like what some would write as a review. Sorry but wouldn't recommend.
1,I liked the premise of the story and think it had potential but fell short. I enjoyed it at first and hoped that the author would develop the characters and plot more. They could have been way more interesting but ended up being thin and boring after a while. Once the characters had sex, it just became all about sex and drama and misunderstandings. Several plot gimmicks were thrown in to try to make the book more interesting but were ridiculous and I couldn't help but feel like rolling my eyes. Contains explicit sex and language.
1,A short but somewhat interesting story which takes place in 1939.  I like the mystery part, but I don't like Hawker.  I do not blame his wife for not wanting him around.  He is arrogant and not very likable.  He prides himself on his knowledge of Sherlock Holmes, but don't think he really understands the great man.
1,with this, I do NOT, at all, intend to defend women. In that, I am not much different than Max. But the guy is just a marketer, he's fake, and like all other idiots who think that they've done something great by getting drunk and having sex with wasted dumb girls, he doesn't deserve to be taken seriously, he's just a clown
1,This was like a teenage girl's childish fantasy. The characters were one dimensional, world view scary and ridiculous.
1,I didn't finish the first chapter.  The opening scenario is very cliche: Young woman returns to home-town after several years absence, still pining for her childhood sweetheart.  While I can read the same plot a thousand times -- after all, there's nothing new under the sun --  the story must have interesting, unique characters and a writing style that indicates that the writer graduated from grammar school.  This is not to say Ms. Lynn used bad grammar or poor spelling, but her sentence structure is very basic and (sorry) boring.  Her organization is linear rather than complex.  She shows promise, but needs a good editor.
1,Disgusting. I hated this book. It was way too extreme and not one aspect was remotely attractive. She was marked in the same way a dog marks his territory...need I say more?
1,Just like the previous 2 parts, this was too short.  I still did not like Prince,  He was going to mess around with that Maria hoe again after the party  after everything that had happened.  All the while talking about how Sierra was the love of his life.  That's what got him into trouble in the first place.  I just didn't trust him and his decision making.  At some point I expect to see growth and maturity in a character and Prince acted like a little boy..  If he loved Sierra liked he said he would have reminded Maria that she was married and that their relationship was simply co-parenting nothing more. I didn't believe he would be faithful to Sierra.  I  just thought he was lame and I wish the author would have stuck to the title of the series and had Sierra get seriously involved with someone else, like maybe Kaseem, now that would have made for an interesting story, particularly if she got pregnant by him, then Prince's dumb a$$ would have had to accept that.
1,Disgusting. Pretty near written porn. I am not interested in this type of writting or reading material.
1,Everything about this book is rather absurd.  I loved CC's early FBI books.  The characters and tension and storylines drew me right in.  This book is silly and boring.  The way the characters speak to each other makes them appear foolish rather than witty.  The plot is plodding and not all that interesting.  The romance isn't very deep.  There just isn't much good I can say about this book.
1,There was a slow kind of mystery drawn out between the 3 books, but other than that the stories centered on getting everybody married at the end (this was invariably achieved). If you like slightly racy (but still restrained) love scenes, and are into romances, you could give this one a try. Personally, novels dealing purely with romance are not my cup of tea.
1,Didn't help me
1,This book had so much potential but it felt rushed. The end left me wondering what her decision was reguarding her career, but I assume it would be told in second book(?). I'm not sure I would want to read next in series because I like longer books and if the others are just as rushed then I will pass.
1,I really wanted to like this story a lot more than I did.  It had a great premise.  I love stories set on college campuses.  I just never felt any connection with either of the main characters.  I would have loved to know more about them and find out why they connected with each other.  I get they found each other very attractive.  Crickett is described basically as VA-VA-VOOM.  Tucker with his glasses on is a frumpy professor but once they glasses come off he is a super hottie.  They both fantasize a lot about each other.  I will say the fantasies are HOT!  However, I never really got why either one of these characters felt such a connection to the other.  This is a short novella that is hot but I needed a little more to care about the characters.
1,Really nothing special... Don't waste money on this book, instead just begin writing your kindle books.
1,just please don't buy this is nothing what you'd expect and sadly amazon doesn't offer refunds on books that suck this book got one star because we can't not give stars
1,The entire work was marred by repeated poor grammar. spelling, vocabulary,  I read it twice--not on purpose, but because as I read each line or paragraph, I had to go back and read it to either determine what was being said, or just to satisfy myself by inserting missing or wrongly worded phrases, etc.
1,The story line  sounds like it could be developed into an interesting book, but even being free, this tiny bit was not worth putting out there without a real story ready to back it up.  Don't think l will follow up on this one.
1,Not mine and my friend no longer uses my phone anymore.
1,I honestly have no words. I am surprised, disappointed, and thoroughly confused. These confusions not only are about this book, but the countless positive reviews that have been posted about this book. These four and five star reviews can not be about the same book I read! I honestly had incredibly high hopes for this book. Firstly, it took me a while to find it. The pretense of the story seemed different and interesting, and so I assumed it to be a good read, especially considering the amount of positive reviews it received. Now I cannot take reviews seriously.		Firstly, in the description, this book talks about two characters -- Cassandra and Granger Mortensen. However, every single passing character has a backstory in this book; and I am not being facetious at all. We learn about the life of every psychologist in this story, everyone in law enforcement that comes into contact with Granger, Cassandra or anyone else, their friends, the maids, housekeepers, dogs, people Granger and Cassandra pass at the creek, doctors that don't like Brett Parker, people who work in pharmaceuticals commissioned by the government, private detectives and investigators, unscrupulous people who are in the business of "making people disappear," etc etc. EVERYONE HAS A STORY! UGH. I could not believe what I was reading. It is nice if you feel as an author that you have enough to create a series, so it would make sense to include friends or individuals who might be parlayed into their own story or book. But that is not what happened here. It was as if every single individual, relevant and (especially) non-relevant had to be explained, and had to dwell on their childhood, or past mistakes, or whatever. I can honestly say that only about fifty percent of this book belongs to Cassandra and Granger -- everything else is about everyone else!		This book was painful to get through. I finished this on principal, but it did take me quite some time to do so. I just could not fathom the thinking process or the original storyboard for this book. To create backstories on individuals that do not even last throughout the book is nonsensical. There are some characters that just show up halfway in the book, and then we do not read of them any longer. What was the point?!		This book was just incredibly disjointed. Cassandra's friend Cynne was incredibly annoying. Actually, each character that we saw more of (as in they were constants in the lives of Granger or Cassandra), was a contradiction within themselves. Cynne for example was annoyingly crazy with her `movie protocol' statements at the most inappropriate times. She would act fine in one minute, but then be a total witch in another (especially to Raidon). Satin was another story, though very similar. She was unreadable at times, incredibly inappropriate, and incredibly unbelievable as an attorney. Who acts like that? I could not believe some of the things she would say. And then to have detectives spank you in your own office as your `punishment' for inappropriate language? On what universe!		Then comes Latasha. She is very minuscule in this story, and we meet her near the end. However, I did not like or appreciate the little `make over' that Cynne, Satin and Cassandra treated her to. They permed her hair at a wedding that she was to work at, did her make-up, basically pampered her. I have never had a perm, but I know it takes a while. Anyway, I just did not like the fact that they permed her hair, and then all of a sudden it transformed her from an ugly duckling to a beautiful swan that no one could take their eyes off of. People can look beautiful in afros too!		I just could not believe this. I haven't even gotten to Cassandra and Granger, but that within itself should show the hodge-podge that is this story. It is as if too many hands were writing this while not collaborating, and they just had to put something together. The story was not fluid at all, and would just switch from one person to the next without even an indication. Then people would talk to themselves, or think back to past events on multiple ocassions. This book is horrible! Brett and Martina were not that smart to get away with the load of things they got away with. Plus, the way they would talk to each other was so weird and uncomfortable to read. They were cousins, but were talking to each other (on multiple occasions) as if they were (young and immature) lovers. Cassandra was a wallowing flower for some reason, although her prior personality apparently did not suit that. Granger was weird as his personality changed so often in his decision making, and it did not mesh. It is as if he were not the same person. I have not even gotten to the long run on sentences that are heavy in this book, as well as some choices of grammar. It was just too much, and I am incredibly disappointed. I am also concerned about what some consider as good reading, as this was not it. This is the first I have read from this author, and it will be my last.
1,Ick.  This is an accurate description of a manwhore.  He prefers lots of sex with strangers, and  wants absolutely no relationship to develop.  There was nothing attractive about him, nothing that would make you want to know him better, and heaven help you if you trusted him with your heart!  Having a crappy mother (or father) is no excuse for being a jerk.  BUT THERE IS HOPE! I have the next book on the carousel, and this author writes great romances.  Let's see what happens next...	Jgtimm
1,At the beginning of this story I thought Miko was similar to Helva in "The Ship Who Sang". Even after reading the story twice, I am not sure about anything of how or why Miko has been merged to the ship.		In this science fiction short the author starts with the interesting concept of a man merged with his space ship that gets merged with an alien.  The problem is that he has so much fun with the pseudo science babble that the reader (Ok Me) has difficulty understanding the story's universe.		When I read a short story, I expect to be hit by one big emotion. This story just had me scratching my head wondering what happened.  Just as I was getting interested in the new symbiotic merger that has been created it ended.  It felt as if the author didn't know what to do with his new creation, which led to a very disappointing ending.		The beginning of the story was also a problem as each paragraph seemed to introduce a new portion of the universe without fulling explaining it.  So I don't understand why there is a co pilot's chair and no co pilot. I don't know if this "merger" is permanent or can be part time. There is never a clear description of the aliens.  Just bits of information scattered over several paragraphs.  Example of first description of aliens		" Tentacles grabbed him and he was marched before a score of neck-high, zygoteish-looking creatures. The `Zikri', as it turned out, were ET's."		I truly do not understand what the author means by "zygoteish" or ET's (unless he was referring to the movie, which in my opinion is not a good descriptive technique)		I don't recommend this story.		I saw at the end of the story that this is included in a collection&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Future-Destinies/dp/B005GFJ15Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Future Destinies</a>. At first I thought perhaps this universe was described more thoroughly in the other stories in the collection, however according to the one review I read there are several universes in the collection.
1,Least favorite of all the ones I have read so far. Slow. And had some mess about a girl that was kidnapped and held for 10 years, but who was she and what happened to her. Sloppy.
1,meh
1,This book sounded like a good happy ever after story, however, the reasons for the breakup took a page out of Days of our lives or some other soap opera. After that it was pretty boring. I recommend u save the money and skip it..
1,The story was good but too much sexual	 content.  Did not finish reading.
1,The characters were very one dimensional and the mystery stalker was not very mysterious. I read through to the end so I guess that can count for something.
1,After reading all the reviews, I was looking forward to reading this. I was very disappointed as it was very slow and nothing much happens at all. Also, I've never known a book with quite so many characters. Nice cover, pointless book!
1,This book was all over the place and written in a very child like manner. It is not a simple editing problem.
1,I don't mind when dialogue is sometimes a little flowery or a little cheesy, but both the dialogue and the writing itself were so painfully corny or saccharine sweet it felt like I was reading a story written by a tween girl. Even the eventual (and one & only) sex scene, I found myself rolling my eyes and skipping parts of it. There's very little character development. Also, that unrealistic club scene. First, what was the purpose of them going there, to get Dustin to hook up with someone? After all, he did leave him alone the majority of the night. And this prince who hangs out in the club? It didn't even seem plausible. It could've been some random lookalike with a big dude following him around. Just the fact that everyone believed him, heck, I'd get all the cute boys numbers, too. It's not like either of them were that bright. This does not make me look forward to more from this writer.
1,This book is TERRIBLE!
1,This book was not that good, it seemed rushed and jumped from person to person and then there was really no ending its like it just stopped, as long as this book took to come out it should have been way better than this.
1,It has been awhile since I tried reading this. Stopped about 1/4 into it as the story just did not grab me.
1,Not nearly as good as the rest of this series. The main characters did not portray the images developed in the series.
1,Please note that this review is my opinion of the tale and does not reflect upon the author's ability to write in any way. I had several issues with this installment of the fourth fleet irregulars series. The first is that it departs from the formula that the author has established in the first four books dramatically. The book is 80% about non mission events and the actual mission is tacked on as a rushed bare bones accounting that drops off in a cliff hanger instead of fleshing out the repercussions. This leaves the mission feeling as an "And In Other News" story tacked on to the end of the book. This book also introduced the Quarian ambassador and waxed almost poetic about the empathic abilities of said ambassador. Unfortunately, the author decided to use esper empathy as a limited and unrealistic subset of abilities to feel all emotions but some negative emotions were ignored as "not important" because the ambassador didn't have the ability to understand them. Please note that the author stated that the ambassador could feel them but not understand them so dismissed them. The ambassador was also written to be a highly ethical being as far as empathy was concerned. These two principles are in direct conflict with one another as distress would cause an ethical being to attempt to alleviate as much distress as possible not ignore an unpleasant emotion as not important. That more than anything else made me dislike the entire book. However, I did finish it so it wasn't too bad, just not very enjoyable and I was looking forward to the end of the book instead of wanting more.
1,Usually I debt for a long time with purchasing an e-book that does not have the number of pages. I first did the sample and it pulled me in. I thought I was in store for a long journey between Amy and Collin, but sad to say that was not the case. It was over before it even begun. I am not cut out for the kiddie stories you know the little stories parent's read to their 2-3yr old because their attention span is short lived. If you are into those type stories then this book is ok but if you want some substance, some meat, want to get full and then some I would say don't waste your time or money.
1,Yet another poorly written and virtually unedited book about the collapse of the United States. I could only force myself to read less than a third of the book, hoping that it would finally improve. It did not. The protagonist and his companions are the usual collection of red-blooded hyper-macho and extremely competent people you would, of course, encounter in any randomly selected community. The villains are stereotypical sadistic losers, idiots and fools. To call the characters in this book cardboard is an insult to a perfectly useful material.		Give this one a wide berth.
1,First off, I have trouble categorizing these books. At first they seem to have a mature theme to them, since the Young Ancient series deals with some very mature themes, but then the actual characters are mostly children. In the first several books, the story revolves around one teenager in the first person as he begins to enter adulthood, but then in a later book the author switches protagonists. The author also assured that the two novels that didn't spotlight the main character would not heavily impact the series. This was patently untrue. This novel appears to pick up where 'A Simple Darkness', the novel staring the protagonists sister, left off.		I found the main character of these books to be fascinating, compelling, and was able to suspend my disbelief accordingly for the first six novels. In the seventh, the author takes a 12 year old village bakers boy with the maturity level and ability to cope of a 30 year old and places him in a grueling and harsh society unlike anything he had previously experienced and has him deal with it better than most seasoned military professionals, I'm sorry, I can no longer give him a positive review. The character of the eighth book is simply unlikable in my opinion, and while author reverts back to the primary character in this latest installment, you'd be completely lost if you didn't read the two books that had nothing to do with the main character.		So I'm sorry, I'm sorry I bought this book. I'm sorry I have to give it a single star, and I'm sorry that I couldn't enjoy this story.
1,I got through 50% of this book before I quit.  The protagonist was just both too sexual and dumb for me.  He wasn't a good investigator and just seemed to have sexual relations with any young male (excepting, thank goodness, the boyfriend of the missing young man).  I didn't have any idea of why someone who is 2000 years old would be attracted to him (besides his looks, which only go so far).  The writing is okay. but I wasn't particularly involved with the story (hence my not even remembering the name of the protagonist, despite reading this yesterday).
1,Strange sounding recipes. Lots of errors.
1,Very short story and not very good.
1,I had such a hard time finishing this boring book! Everyone was perfect and beautiful, the author kept mentioning how witches don't wear underwear like it's a key plot point. Layla gets bone crushing injuries that should of killed her multiple times in one week. I was so tired of her being constantly under attack and the evil villains are bizarre in their actions. (example: killing half of your own army in a temper tantrum)	The characters were one-dimensional. The best books stay with you, but I will have no problem forgetting this one.	And the amazing event at the end? 100% predictable.
1,This story was ok but adding a third unfortunately did not make it hotter. The mnage was sort of forced and contrived and as a result the whole storyline was weak. This is not one of the authors best.
1,This was a good novella but  I did not like it quite as much because of Josephine's cheating on her husband. You will read about some of it in other books. She was in love with someone else and family made her marry Traverson. She was committing adultery 3 days later with the other man. She blamed being forced to marry the reason she did it. Her husband was always off collecting bugs. He was aware of her cheating and never said a word.  He caught a man leaving her house after spending the night at her house. The incident that happened then may been the reason the cheating stopped . You will have to find out for yourself is it to late for them. Traverson seems to have finally reached his breaking point with her. She is like the other woman love seems out of reach at first to them
1,This formulaic romance between a single mother and ex-hockey star offers very little to the reader, not even sex since the characters never get beyond kissing even though he is 38 and she just a little younger. I never once believed in the paper-thin characters and their trivial dilemmas. He lives alone in an 18-room mansion. She lives with her son in  6-room house. The solution? They'll find a 12-room home to live in together. Please!
1,The ability read people's minds, kill with just a thought, incredible wealth...and she's still 'on the run', getting shot and almost dying (a couple times).  Then to find her mother, with the ability to read minds, didn't know her husband lied about her daughter's birth?  This book not only requires suspension of belief, but the ability to throw out all logic is essential.
1,I was disappointed with the way this book ended. There were so many other ways she could have ended this series.
1,When they say short stories, they mean short.  It felt like paragraphs were plucked out of full books.  One story was less than a page long.
1,There just seemed to be a lack of depth. Overall I think it was a good storyline but it didn't feel connected. I wanted it to all pull together but it just didn't get there.
1,This was so not good. The premise was there, the characters had potential... but the writing was just bad. Nothing had enough detail, the characters were flat and i only finished because it was so simple to read I figured I might as well finish. I think this might have been a novella in the middle of a series but still not an excuse for a poorly written story.
1,"The Sky Triangle" - Book One (The Triangle Trilogy) is the first in a trilogy of Sci-Fi adventures by author J.O. Walker. This Kindle e-book was a 164 Kb download and retails for $3.44.		Please Note:	1.) the author has provided me with a free copy in exchange for an honest review.	2.) the author has indicated to me the intended audience is Young Adult with the focus group being late-teens.		<spoilers>		Several families find themselves stranded on a pleasure cruise-ship within that dreaded nautical graveyard, the Bermuda Triangle. A small group of bored and inquisitive teens decided to explore their watery confines and in doing so, not only discover many other stranded seafarers of ages past, but also uncover many new things about this mysterious area of the Atlantic ocean.		<end spoilers>		Some thoughts on "The Sky Triangle"...		1.) a plot with an interesting premise and set in an area renowned for its  mystery and intrigue.		2.) writing that was on a level that would appeal to a teen age audience, but not I think, to a 'late-teen' reader as the author has indicated. To me, it would better suit a tween age (12-15) target group as evidenced by...	a.) the story and writing has a very simple and benign quality to it.	b.) very little goes drastically wrong (given the circumstances), despite some questionable decisions by our teenage adventurers.	c.) <spoiler> the introduction of an alien being(s) that were so friendly and harmless, it was unexpectedly disappointing. An opportunity lost perhaps to inject some excitement into what turned into a rather dull adventure.		3.) a story that possibly might appeal more to adolescent girls than boys... with its romance, budding friendships and its general lack of anything with unpleasant consequences.		Conclusions:	A story that held some promise for an exciting Young Adult (tween) work, but the lack of any real danger, personality conflicts or at the very least, a villain, left this reader wishing for something to really go awry so the characters might encounter some dangerous or life and death decisions.		Maybe the next installment will have some substance to it... it's sorely needed.		As it is... 2 Stars.		Ray Nicholson	raynicholsonsreviews@hotmail.com
1,The start was ok, but the ending was total crap! For 3.99 you can't finish the story? I shouldn't have to follow you on Twitter to find out what happens in the end.
1,Did not enjoy the book.
1,worthless gibberish. Do not waste your time or money getting this one. Junk is to good a word for it.
1,If you're just looking to kick back and read light then it fits the bill.  Just don't look at the cover.  Unfortunately, this book is a fine example of one huge pet peeve of mine.  Covers that don't match the book.		I have already had my rant on this elsewhere so no use going into it again.
1,For about 95% of this book all we heard was this girl talking in her head.  Any other lines that were written were just one or 2 sentences.  I just didn't like it.
1,This is a story about survival, much like the Great Depression.	There is no huge catastrophe, or terrorist attacks, just the collapse of the dollar, only worldwide.	Chip describes himself as a poor man, from a long line of poor people. He has a farm, left to him by his parents. He works construction, and as a handyman, doing various odd jobs. This is a big help when civilization falls completely apart.	There are grammar errors, and the overuse of many terms, and the writing is simplistic, but it's not too bad.	Results: it's definitely a right-wing type of story, but it has some good ideas, and it never hurts to learn about living without electricity, foraging, and farming.
1,I couldn't read very far. The writing technique was really difficult to sort through. The head-hopping was hard to follow. In one scene, you are with Maddie, a suject of interest in a murder, then you're supposed to be in her memories, yet the point of view is the dead person, thinking things Maddie would have no way of knowing, then you're suddenly back in Maddie's head. I'm sorry I wasted money on this book. I've read a lot of free, self-published books where the writer had a better knowledge of their craft.
1,A very short story with a long list of sex acts with no story. Oh oh forgot a story line!
1,I enjoy a book with explicit sex scenes, this was sadistic and cruel. This book turned me off to the point that I did not even finish reading it.
1,There were just blank pages after one recipe.  Extremely disappointed, was looking forward to  some tasty dishes for my freezer.
1,its okay
1,The world of Exquisite Captive is fascinating. I love the concept of a world of djinn and how the Dark Caravan (the djinn slave trade) links their world with the human world. As the story takes place in our time, it's especially intriguing to see how djinn magic is integrated into modern society. What could have made the story would have been the characters and the story they had to tell. As it is, the story could have used more fleshing out, especially with the characters, their backstory, and their motivations.		Exquisite Captive is told in third-person perspective alternating between Nalia and Raif with the occasional chapter detailing a serial killing of female djinn around the world. I like how the multiple POVs gives us an idea of what is happening on different fronts. Nevertheless, it didn't feel like it was necessary, like I could have gotten the story just as well if only Nalia's perspective had been given. Maybe even better considering how poorly the characters were developed. The addition of Raif's perspective didn't lend extra suspense or mystery to the story. It was just there. And I definitely would have been happy if the killer's perspective was left out. It was *disgusting disgusting disgusting* I get that it's supposed to horrify us, but the grossing-me-out part aside, it felt like a bad sideshow theater that popped up here and there without warning, and it didn't make me feel scared for Nalia until the last two killings, which I guess the earlier killings set up? Anyhow, I just wasn't feeling it.		From the beginning, I never really felt a connection with Nalia, or any of the characters for that matter, the problem being that they are inconsistent. For example, Nalia will feel helpless one second, then stand up for herself the next, only to crumble before yet another obstacle standing in her way. She also doesn't seem to know how she feels about Malek given how one moment she'll hate him for the way he's tormented her in the past and the next she wants to kiss him. Of course, there's also frustrating Raif who unlocks a world of emotion for her from one touch. . . and she's only just met him. As cool as I think Raif is, it definitely would have helped the romance angle if he and Nalia spent more time getting to know each other instead of trying to hate each other. The same goes for Malek. I don't know what that guy is thinking. Honestly, it seems like the author is trying to make him act like a bad guy, so there's a reason for Nalia to choose Raif.		Besides these points, there are a lot of inconsistencies and lack of adequate motivation / explanation for the characters to choose the courses of action that they do. A good example of this is the quest that Raif and his sister are on. They make this item seem like it holds all the potential to save the djinn from the terrible reign of the Ifrit, yet they don't fully discuss the potential consequences of bringing such an item to light. And Nalia. She made an oath that Raif and his sister want her to break, and she thinks about all of the reasons not to break her oath. Then one thought about her brother, and she decides that it's worth potentially damning the rest of the world to save him. In another world, maybe this could have made sense, but it doesn't seem like these characters spend much time thinking out what they want to do. The lack of consistency makes it hard to connect with them.		My biggest problem with this story, character aside, is how there isn't much action. Other than the fact that Nalia spends most of the book trying to figure out how to steal her bottle from Malek, it feels like the story is about the romance, and Nalia trying to seduce Malek to get her bottle is for gratuitous pleasure. I mean, for someone who's supposed to hate Malek, Nalia was pretty quick to jump onto this idea. Even if Malek's sudden interest in her seems to lead up to this, I would've expected Nalia to try and think of some other ideas before choosing this one. On top of that, there isn't much strategic planning or talk of important matters around Raif; rather, their meetings seem to be about the sexual tension between the two and how much they frustrate the other.		Frankly, I considered dnfing this book early on because of the characters, and I probably would have somewhere. However, there was was enough here to convince me to give the whole of the novel a try, and there were pieces that I enjoyed even if the events leading up to them didn't make much sense. While this book ended up being just an okay book, I do see potential for more expansion of the world and characters in the next installment.
1,With the exception of the fact there was a brief sex scene and the heroine Ally was in her mid-twenties I would have thought this story was teen fan fiction written for their friends. This is a perfect example of a story, which is in dire need for an editor.  If it hadn't been free I would have been very upset.		The typos and grammar errors were too numerous to count. Not to mention missing dialolgue tags and thoughts not being properly marked as such. It made the whole story look unprofessional and confusing to read.		Getting past the errors I think this could be a decent story. It just needs a lot of work.
1,Not enough grovel from Dean and it was a stupid misunderstanding. Ten years is a long time for not clearing up the issues. So I am giving this story a 2.
1,Boring, boring, boring.  I can't think of anything more boring than international investment banking.  Read thru the 2nd murder, skipped to the last book and then skipped large portions to the finale.  Unlikable, one-dimensional, stupid characters.  Wish I hadn't wasted my time, waiting for a book on subscription from my public library to arrive
1,I did not finish this.  I only read the first few chapters.  It was not poorly written the story line was just not my thing and I could be wrong but felt like I had already figured out how it was going to play out.
1,Where do I start? I didn't enjoy what I did read, which were the first 3 stories of the e-book. The stories were boring and lame.	 I don't usually read erotic stories but I do go to erotic poetry night here in my city a few times a year, so I thought  reading a story would be no different...WRONG! maybe one day I'll pick back up where I left off but for now, I'm done
1,As a gamer, I find your books interesting.  I love the idea of a video game being played out irl.  But 2-3x per page,  you will just insert a totally random word into a sentence.  Having to stop that often, to try to figure out what you are trying to say is--fatiging.  You are fond of saying "He had went", and you only used the word "adventurer", correctly, once...he introduces himself as "an adventure" not adventurer.  As a reader, I don't mind paying an author well for entertaining me.  Please respect your customers enough to give them a finished product.  If this was edited,  I would have given you 5 stars.
1,I generally like works by Connie Brockway, for she draws her characters well and plots interesting well written tales. Which is why this short story received two stars instead of one. This story revolves around neighbors who have always been destined to wed, as far as their village and families assume. Yet the hero is slow to act and in time honored tradition the heroine decides a bit of jealousy will move him along. Of course, using the character of  a villain from several other books, this machination backfires and ... well, you know the formula. My objections to this work are: first, the length - a mere six chapters; second, the cost - many excellent full length Regencies can be had for the price or less; and third, the adherence to formula. I have come to expect Me. Brockway to expend the effort to make each story her own by going above and beyond hackneyed plots and injecting some creativity. Not here. This short story instead reads like a previously unpublished draft of a section of a full novel, or an early attempt. Perhaps I am most disappointed by an established author displaying her venality by tossing off a quick one close to the holidays simply because her readers will buy literally anything she publishes at this point. Another author going the way of Nora Roberts ... what a waste of a reputation.
1,I realize that this is a extremely short introduction to the main characters in order to entice the reader to follow this series but it really failed with me, because:	There was nothing to draw me to care about the characters as they were merely introduced rather than developed.	There was no real heat, no build up of suspense, or of world building, just -	  My mate	  She's scare that mating will interfere with her FBI job	  We'll make it work - let's have sex and mark each other	  Oh by the way - I have to get my mother out of a bad place	  The end - to be continued		That was it.  While there was no misspellings or wrong word usage, there was also no development of characters, the world they live in, or the plot.  More of a very bare outline of a story.  While the author maybe capable of writing, I am very leery that she can write a fully developed series.  It would have been more convincing if she had spent more time developing the characters and setting up the suspense in the 1st book in the series to entice the reader to keep returning to find out more about what happens to them.  As it stands now - I don't care about the characters or if they ever get their HEA.  This came off as more of a couple of underdeveloped first few chapters that I fear are going to continue with more underdeveloped chapters.
1,Didn't care for this. Two stars because it was well written. The two MCs  I d care for at all. Peter is an arrogant assassin who has a God complex and while Chad had some redeeming characteristics he was very weak. Being used and abused is not love in my book.
1,started off good but grew stale very fast, just another case of a clown who needs to stick to his circus day job instead of torturing readers
1,Uh, nope.
1,Pull My Hair would've been a great read if the heroine would've been more likable.  She came off as shallow, paranoid and childish so much so that I slogged my way through this book and almost wished the hero would leave her.  If you must read it, if not move onto a more worthy selection.
1,I am not a fan of censorship, but this book has inspired the murder of over 100,000,000 people and enslaved nations.  It should not be sold anywhere.
1,Oh, I so wanted to like this book. I really did. I mean, I LOVE sports romance. LOVE IT! However, I made it about 35% in and I just couldn't take it any more. Tanner is douchecanoe. Like, a big one. He is so callous and uncaring of everyone around him. And I HATE that Emma loves him. He has literally done NOTHING to deserve her love. So, its all based on looks which makes me CRAZY. So, in summary: Tanner=douchecanoe Emma=idiot. Me=disappointed
1,Too short. Put all books in this series in one volume and it would be worth three books, not all listed.
1,So many mistakes it made it hard to follow and the author even got the names mixed up on one part. I guess no one double checked the work.
1,could've been better
1,I felt like I was reading two completely different books, and unfortunately, I didn't enjoy either one. The first 60-75% of the book was sweet, but boring. I don't know if that came from all the football speak or if it was a lack of chemistry between two otherwise very likable characters. The last 30% or so abruptly changed the tone of the book and I had trouble following exactly what was going on because there was just so much thrown in to increase the dramatic factor. Jackson became unrecognizable and Leila lost that spunkiness that made her so likable at first. I loved the plot of this one, I just wish it panned out better.
1,This book needs a LOT of editing. The first couple of chapters seemed fine with minimal if any editing needed but the rest of the book .... Felt like a different writer got a hold of it and cut out all the plot development and believability. Whole paragraphs were jumbles of words that made no sense whatsoever. The description says, that "the aliens didn't anticipate resistance from their human" and yet, I saw zero resistance from the human even when he believed the aliens killed six of his neighbors.	I gave two stars because the first two chapters were well written and carried a lot of potential. The missing stars are from lack of cohesion, misuse or typos that weren't caught (example .... "let to this day" should have been "led to this day") and from the paragraphs that made no sense.
1,I was going to download this free book and had no problem paying $2.99 for the rest of the books in the series. Until I looked ahead and saw that none of them are more than 60 or 70 something pages. For $2.99 I can get plenty of books in the 200 to 400 page range. So, sorry, but I am passing on the free one because after buying Kindle books here for several years I just think the price is too much for a 60 or 70 page book when I know I can and should get much more for my money. Frankly, I don't even consider something that short a book. A few other authors here on Amazon are doing the same thing and we readers need to show them we like to read but we don't like being ripped off. Look at all the books in this series, total up the number of pages in all of them, then the total price of all of them and see what you will pay to read the equivalent of one normal book by most authors.
1,I'm sorry, I could stand the male lead.
1,NOT a Christian romance book!  I was enjoying the light, fun, if somewhat predictable story, when it got rather silly.  I kept reading, thinking it would be ok once I got past the elopement scene.  Instead, WHAM! Along came a too-detailed-for-me wedding night.  Didn't even finish that chapter, much less the rest of the story.
1,The Strong's Dictionary is usually very helpful in Bible study. This one has no way of finding the words. The numbers from Strong's Dictionary are there, but the first part of the original book with the words in English that the numbers go with is missing.	I would recommend that no one buy this product.
1,First: This book is a reissued, republished book, from the 1980s.  A regurgitation,  if you will...		The editing for the Kindle edition is practically nonexistent. It's a sloppy, slap dash piece of 'editing'. Particularly irritating is the substitution of the numeral 1 for the word "I". It recurs incessently.		Second: There is no agony, no indignity, no torment that the author won't torture the main characters with. In fact, she seems to take perverse pleasure in torturing her characters.		The "bad guys" are all powerful. The "good guys" are wimpy & long suffering.		The author makes free use of every clichd plot device ever used since written literature began.		I won't bore you with horrific spoilers. There are simply too many to point out anyway.		If you're into depression,  you'll adore this book. It's a pointless bummer of a book & I refuse to ever read another of Ms. Bonds horrors.
1,It was kinda creepy. I'm also in my thirties and the idea of a middle aged woman seducing a kid kinda grosses me out. It was really short and i kinda felt like it was written by a guy. Who seduces a virgin preachers son without any consequences or even feeling bad about it. I bought the second for free but i hate starting a story in the middle so i went to buy the first one. Maybe i'm just reading too much into it but i couldn't even finish the second one. I guess I'm not a cougar at heart.
1,I had no idea. Why don't they come out with a rating on books like they do movies? I picked this up to read at lunch in the cafeteria at work and it's too embarrassing to read there. Also, there is a possible decent story here but the annoying sex keeps getting in the way. So not my thing.
1,Not exactly my cup of tea, but it wasn't terrible and was still well written.
1,The writing style is reminiscent of a high school essay and lacks complex relationship or story line development. The interactions between characters are shallow and one dimensional. The story fails to entertain or entice. The sex is forgettable.
1,While it was a decent read it was rather frustrating to find out it is NOT a complete story. While the title says book one it SHOULD read PART one.
1,Got about half way through somehow. Just too unbelievable. Really? SEALS in some bunker or something hiding a civilian, a sister no less, and the powers that be just let her stay while they do nothing. Then they fly off on some unknown trip with no planning. Whatever, just too much bull.
1,wow not nearly as good as the first one. the writing style was just ok in this one but I found the dialogue didn't flow like it did in Soul. As a matter of fact I found most of the content trite. The premise of this one was to find answers but they didn't make contact with Smith until almost 1/2 way through the book. I also don't like it when an author deliberately creates conflict between several parties as in who is she going to chose, this man or that one. The ending of the book sucked and there was no resolution and I am assuming that the next one will resolve some of it but not enough to interest me in reading any further. I expect a writers style to improve with each book, not get worse so I am done with this author.
1,I am not familiar with the Liz Latimer Pirate Hunter series but if they are written like this one, I can't recommend them very highly. All action no plot, like a modern Hollywood flick. Too many shifts of identity for my poor old brain. One thing I did like, though, was the excellent depiction of Victoria, BC and the harbor. I recognized it instantly even without the text note. And anything that celebrates International Talk Like a Pirate Day can't be all bad.		I received this review copy of The Virtual Pirate (Elizabeth Latimer Pirate Hunter, prequel) by Deborah Cannon through Librarything.com.
1,The premise of this story is interesting.  The author had me hooked in the beginning .  The writing had it's good and bad points but I was willing to overlook them for the sake of the story.	I cannot overlook the "ending". This cliffhanger ending is a real turnoff.  This is like someone took a book and tore out the first 1/3 and sold it.  A book should have a beginning AND an end. I realize it is a trilogy and that means 3 books but it should give me the option of WANTING to go forward, not force me.	I do not care enough to complete this series.
1,The print was too small for me to read.  Soooo I did not read it
1,I did not enjoy the content of the books and I could not finish reading them.  I would not recommend this set.
1,Any Way You Dream It was completely predictable and ended exactly how I wanted it to. Unfortunately getting to that end was somewhat painful. The book is in great need of an editor. There were occasional stretches that were fine, but then thered be several errors a page for a while. Occasionally I had no idea what the author even meant. Things went on a bit too long, too, like the author was just trying to stretch the length. Its the second in a series, but there is no need to read the first book first. I only recommend Any Way You Dream It to people wanting a total mind vacation who don't mind grammar and spelling errors.
1,did not like
1,I found this book under Christian fiction. It is NOT Christian. I read about 30% and had to stop because of a highly inappropriate scene between a husband & wife. Way too much detail. Not a book I recommend at all.
1,not worth it even for free
1,The book was written well and the author can write a story.  I really just didn't like the story.  The plot was good (someone was attacked) and the characters were fine.  I felt like the inbetween stuff was too repetitive.  Like when someone tells you something and then proceeds to drill it endlessly on and on.		Candace was attacked.  This is all about those feelings and how they don't go away easily, if ever.
1,This story was slow and boring at times.  The actual parts that have zombies are very few.  It is a story about survivors, but they do not seem to go through as much toil as they do in other novels.  Most of the zombie action seems to be in flashbacks.  Did not like it, but it was free.  Had to force myself to finish it.
1,The author spent so much time describing the heroine's thoughts in the same sentence as the dialogue of the story I could make it only through the first chapter before I deleted the book. Not only distracting, but the constant interruptions of the story line became tiring. I'm also deleting the other 2 books of this series without opening them.
1,While I have read and enjoyed Ms. Baily's other books, I have to say this one was very UNLIKE THE OTHERS. It took foul language and sickening situations to a disgusting height. I'm glad I did not read this book first or I would not have tried any other of her books which are enjoyable.
1,I did not finish it. From what I remember of the plot, it made little sense from the get go.
1,I'm not the the only reader who hates when authors write a novella, then add another books to make it 100%.  Well, this one on my kindle, was 37%!!  That's right, 37%!  I didn't buy the book for a novella and another book I don't want!!  Not only that but the h is in a coma about 30% of the time!  So you get different people going in and out of her room talking to her while she's in a coma  and pages of thoughts in their head.  It easily could have been included in the first book, or not at all. It's not like it added anything to the story.  I would not recommend this book.
1,This book was unbelievable and very predictable.  It seemed as every other page had at least one repeated paragraph. There were good snippets but majority of the book was blah.
1,What there was of it read well, didn't realize it was only a short preview.  (fill words - to meet Amazon 'minimum words requirement)
1,Good grief!  He hikes her skirts up in the park and fingers her. She's a virgin and yet instantly has an orgasm!  Skirt is lowered and each goes to their respective homes.  Then, AGAIN, he is going to marry her until, AGAIN his ptsd triggers.  So AGAIN he is grotesquely mean to her, all the while looking at her lush plump lips, and rejects her AGAIN.  AGAIN she holds out hope that she can get him to the altar.  Her plan to accomplish that is to stalk him and be in his face and to give him a puppy.  The parents and her brother in this story were caring but written as ineffective bystanders who just took up space in the book.  The hero's best line: "come for me".
1,This book started out great, then I don't know what happened!  People and names were popping up out of nowhere, blatant inconsistencies, and the horribly written sex scenes blew it. The premise was good and the plot started  out great, but I don't know what happened - it's like a draft copy was submitted somewhere in the middle.  The sneak peak at the end of A Girl Called It, sounded intriguing and I would love to finish it, but the Mad Humper had just a few too many technical issues for my taste.
1,If I could get a refund, I would. Blaming his wife for a brutal rape, Michael is a poor  example of a man. His wife needs support and Michael is whining because the rapists had "sex" with his wife. Give me a break. I wonder how Michael would feel if he had been sexually assaulted and his wife reacted in the same manner as he did. Forgiveness-- his wife did nothing wrong. Terrible, terrible book.
1,This was an okay book with no real depth. If you want something that is light reading, I recommend mitt.
1,I just could not get through this book.  The story line was so contrived and the characters were idiotic.  I never finished it.  Don't think I'll be going back for any more by this author.
1,did not like it at all
1,If I could give this book zero stars I would. This book constantly repeated things over and over. Every chapter was about the same thing literally. It wasn't until the last few where the author got somewhere.	The ending made no sense. I wish I would have never touched this series of books. Also a lot of spelling errors.
1,Not that good even for short stories need more details
1,When I shuddered while reading this book, I realized that I needed to stop. The H an h met on a hook up site. Each were just looking to get laid. Yuck. That is not romantic. The physical descriptions of the two matching up also didn't help. It just was not going to be my cup of tea.
1,Didn't get past two pages in before discarding as simple trash. I was not prepared for that! Neither are you. Just pass it on by.......
1,This was the very first BWWM romance book I read and this is a period of my life I will never get back, it was disjointed and nothing made sense about why anybody was doing anything....and of course no idea of what anyone looked like or even sounded. I couldn't understand why all of a sudden they were sneaking around like a couple of high schoolers or why the father was racist but then for some reason decides to accept her and the baby....and that's another thing does anybody not use protection.....I kept reading hoping that it would get better but it never did, I'm just glad it only set be back by 99 cents because if it would have cost me the regular price I would be asking for a refund....
1,This title was among Amish stories.  This is a weird fairy tale!!!!!		I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. That is all I have to say about this book.
1,This is the dumbest game....ever!!  I cant figure it oit and, quite frankley....is a waste of time and paper!  Dumb!!!!
1,This review is a bit difficult for me. I found the characters lacking and redundant. There was more negative than positive in this story which left me feeling unfulfilled.		Jackie Delgado is a 42 yr old single mother whose husband left her to marry his pregnant 20 year old girlfriend. Her self esteem is in the toilet and her youngest son is headed for college leaving her an empty-nester. Her friends want to fix her up but she does not want anything to do with men after what her ex husband did to her.		Mark Brennan is a 48 yr old widower and he isn't looking for love as he raises his two daughters, but he agrees to a blind date which happens to be Jackie Delgado, his daughter's new biology teacher. They have a couple of great dates and Mark goes AWOL for 6 weeks as he deals with feelings of guilt because of the strong feelings he has so quickly developed for Jackie.		First of all Jackie is just way too self deprecating. Most of her thoughts are negative which became a downer for me. It got old real quick and I struggled in places to continue on. Mark Brennan is very immature and behaves more like he is 28. He is an arrogant and cocky jerk at times. For me he bordered on disrespectful with his continuous sexual barbs and double entendres. It definitely confirmed his lack of maturity and he had difficulty holding a serious conversation. He acted more like a hormone-raged teen and it made him appear crass, certainly without class that he should have developed by his position and age.		Do I recommend this book? Yes, because many others liked it. Just because I did not doesn't mean you won't. It is always best to read for yourself and develop your own opinions.
1,I do not understand all the high ratings.  This was a very sappy story that moved way too fast and should have been advertised for young adult readers.  Comparing sex to a morning rain just made me want to hurl.  That's what I meant by sappy - or dreaming of floating on dragon wings.  egads.  It was  not totally bad but it was too juvenile for my taste.
1,Ava Delaney is different, shes not quite a vampire but not quite human either. When Avas mother was pregnant she was attacked and killed by a vampire, Ava was born right before her mother died and some of the vampires poison stayed in her making her somewhat of a hybrid.		Ava does everything she can to fight her cravings for blood and to live like a normal human shutting herself off from others to not harm them. When she comes across a man in danger from a vampire and steps in to help she accidentally claims Carl to keep the other vampire from hurting him. Not knowing how to break the bond Ava seeks help and gets into more than she bargained for in the vampire world.		Not a bad story really but I found myself a bit bored as it seemed to move rather slowly for a short novella. Also, I found Ava a bit frustrating during her first meeting with Peter, seems shed have saved herself a lot of trouble if she would have just said her grandmother sent her.		Overall, didn't grab me as much as Id like but a bit of a different twist on vampires so some may like it.
1,So this was supposed to be a short story right only 158 pages, well try even shorter as the story ends on page 130 and the rest are all snippets of the author's other books including those of her "friends"!  I call that a rip-off!	The story was supposed to be about Jett yet I can count on my hand how many times he features in this extra short story!  Character and plot development non existent.  The story ended so abruptly, I'm thinking you have got to be kidding me!  It's like write a few sex scenes, a few BDSM scenes and viola you have a mass produced non-existent story that can be woven into a series in order to sell.  I seriously wonder who these people are who have rated this 5 stars
1,I enjoyed the single father and single mom dynamic. I even liked the chemistry. But what i didn't enjoy was the constant miscommunication by both parties. It just annoyed me and had me wanting to shout for the both of them to stop being cowards and tell each other how they felt.
1,I didn't care for these 3 books.  To be honest, I only tried to read two but I couldn't stand them, so didn't bother with the third one l  The first, Husband Wanted...the heroine hires a guy to pretend to be her husband so her aunt will think she is living a normal life.  Her whole side of the family is Kooky and the aunt is a good soul that just wants them to be normal.  Not bad to that point.  She hires one of the Carrington's.  He is trying to talk to her about a business deal and she won't give him the time of day, so he slips in this way.  It was okay up until the part where her sister comes to town, goes into her apartment uninvited and then proceeds to trash it and acts like nothing is wrong and she is just a free spirit doing her thing and the whole should just accommodate her.  That little scene set my hair on fire.  That did it for me.  Instead of throwing her sister out on her butt, taking her key back and telling her to call first the next time, she just falls in with it like it is all okay.  I quit reading.  No body would put up with that kind of behavior.  Ugh.		The next a pilot comes home from a very long flight, is sitting in his hot tub after midnight in the dark when 3 very young children coming into his yard thru the fence and climb a fruit tree stealing fruit. After a few minutes a young woman, in pajamas, comes through the fence looking for the kids.  They are trashing his reputation based on gossip and rationalizing that their stealing fruit is okay since he is a mean guy.  He finally stands up to defend himself and they all starting screaming and run for the fence.  Of course, he is instantly smitten by the half naked girl and loses his mind.  She screams at him and defends HER children, telling him they have been taught to not talk to strangers giving the appearance of the perfect mother.  Guess it slipped her mind to teach them that they do not going on other people's property and steal fruit regardless of whether the owner eats it or not, and they do not sneak out of the house after midnight to roam the neighbor.  It was just unbelievable to me even tho I have known people just like her.  I couldn't handle it, I quit.  Since it was two out of three so far that I did not like I didn't bother with #3.  I liked a lot of the other Destiny Bay series but I just couldn't handle this one.
1,This book was awful to try to read! There was misspelled words, wrong grammar, and the story line jumped around and you couldn't tell were one part of the story ended and the other part began. It all ran together. And one part it had them outside then it jumped to them going outside like the author forgot that she already said they were outside. It was a really confusing story to try to read. This is the first book I have read by this author and I won't be reading any more.
1,Where to start... There is a story in here somewhere, but the book is so riddled with errors that slogging through fifty-one pages was a chore. The errors start on the first page with incomplete sentences and just go on from there. The lack of spelling problems leads me to think the author used spellchecker. The abundance of other errors has me convinced the author failed to not only use beta readers, but also failed to proofread her own work.		There is far too much narrative about the company billionaire John MacBeth works for, so much so that it began to feel as though I were reading a different story altogether. There are sentences with extra words that confuse the reader as to what is being said (i.e. the author changed what she was going to write mid-sentence and failed to reread what she wrote).		So what can I say about the storyline, such as it is? Korinna is a bar waitress who picks up extra income working high-end events because she's very good at what she does. Her ex is a sleaze who likes to think she'll marry him and there's a billionaire attracted to her. There is potential here for a decent story. It just isn't there yet. Not even close.		The bottom line is this is not yet a story. This is a work-in-progress that should be pulled from all booksellers until it has been properly edited. I am grateful this story was free. Had I paid for a book in this condition, I would be much less happy about it than I am now.		Because this book was released before it was ready, I can only give one star. That being said, I cannot in good conscience recommend this book in its current condition.
1,Light and fluffy easy to put down and pick up later. Nothing thought provoking here.  If you haven't anything better to read, it's okay.  Author has better developed series than this one like Katieran Prime.		Along the lines of previous stories in this series the main story is entirely dependent on a romance between two primary characters - Abe & Roxanne, offering very little depth on anything else.  Despite the apparent science fiction setting I would not characterize this book and series as SF. It really is only a romance as there is very little world building in the background.  What's with New Earth?  Is it Earth or an otherwise planet called such.  Nice to know Social Security still exists though. These guys are supposed to be Inter-galactic bounty hunters but not much inter-galactic going on.		Readability is good, book flows well.  Light on typographic errors but a couple egregious ones; inadvertent use of the incorrect character's name during a dialogue.
1,Had potential but negatively impacted by an inconsistent and ultimately hypocritical female lead. That could have been forgiven if the ending hadn't come with haste and cliches. Final problem for me was that no mention was made of the fate of the cougar cubs, when every person involved was supposed to be an animal lover.
1,Boring
1,If this was the whole book, what a crock! It had a fantastic start and no ending at all! Shame!
1,This is a tough review to write.  I think the author's writing style is good. I don't have a problem with the concept of someone dating men she meets through a dating service and with dating guys from the different astrological signs.  I just didn't care for the execution.  Even though I am old and old fashioned, I don't expect women to be virgins when they get married but wow. The word slut probably isn't used much any more in these days of sexual freedom, but if the definition of a slut is a woman who has many casual sexual encounters, then the main character, Amy Anderson, qualifies. I am a Christian and I have to say that I was put off by the fact that the main character denigrated Christians.  If anyone ever needed religion, this character is it.  She has no morals.  She sleeps with a guy she met at the airport, sleeps with him again on his wedding day (to someone else) and then on the day of his twin brother's funeral.  This did not seem to bother her conscience one iota.  Amy has close friends and is loyal to them, but her moral compass is missing and she didn't have many other redeeming qualities.  I just didn't like the character and her morals, or lack thereof.  I have no idea why her ex-boyfriend would even consider getting back together with her.  She dumped him and then she breaks up with him because she can't trust him?  As others have stated, the end was confusing.  While the book had some enjoyable moments, overall I didn't like it.
1,Quick read, current day setting, humorous, novel plot idea but lacks substance
1,The story line, to me, was a bit drawn out.  Also, the punctuation was either lacking or punctuated in the wrong places.  Some sentences' context did not make sense to me.  I found the entire writing distracting because of these issues.		I am currently reading an ebook which had been read and edited by other authors of Amazon.  I suggest this author contact said group before publishing another book.
1,Th's "book" is a joke. From the Introduction: "Amish people like to serve very simple life and usually they do not expose themselves to technological life but the food they make is amazing in taste. Amish people make simple but very delicious food. The list of Amish recipes is not huge but still it has some stunning recipes.... Most of Amish recipes contain breads, meat and creamy items. In this book you will learn 30 amazing and delicious Amish recipes that everyone can easily make at home. So let,s dive into book and enjoy best and tasty Amish recipe you ever see.".		The first of the 30 recipes is for White Bread. One recipe is Amish Bread for the Bread Machine (I didn't think the electricity-less Amish had bread machines). The Amish Oven-Fried Chicken recipes calls for 2 teaspoons of black pepper for 10 chicken pieces (whoa, does that seem like a lot of black pepper). The Amish Soft Honey Whole Wheat Bread recipe contains the following direction: "In the meantime place 3 eggs (with shell) in a bowl containing hot water. Add in flour, salt and gluten in the bowl".  Gluten is not listed as an ingredient and I am unsure what is going on with the eggs.		At the 38% mark I am deleting this "book" from my Kindle. If you are considering this book please download a sample first.		The book description makes the  following claim: "=> Each recipe in this cookbook is healthy, tasty and easy to prepare.". I fail to see how it delivers on the this promise.
1,I love zombies. LOVE them. The creatures in this book are not zombies, but that isn't a big deal. An apocalyptic tale of survival with creatures from space set in Paris sounded amazing.		First, I want to start off with the good things about this book. The writing is excellent. I adore Paris and the descriptions were spot-on and made me really want to go back. The concept was unique and interesting, and I was immediately drawn in. The zombie-like characters created by the author were interesting. While I prefer the classic mindless dead, Im not opposed to other creatures, and these were a scary mash-up of zombie/alien/vampire beings that could have made for such a great book. Unfortunately it takes a long time to get to them. For the first half of the story, Jeanie is the only one who even sees them, and then only three times.		Only about twenty-five percent of the way in, I lost interest in the story. There were a couple main reasons for this. One, the prologue takes place months after the catastrophe, and we immediately find out that Jeanie alone lives. It took away a lot of the anticipation. Then, as the story unfolds, I find that I care very little about who lives or dies anyway, because I don't really know any of these characters. Jeanie is very bland and her only defining characteristic is her inability to get over her fathers death. Zou Zou was a walking stereotype of what Americans envision the French are actually like, and with the exception of Ben, none of the other characters are developed at all. Ben alone was someone I could like and connect with. He dropped everything to travel to Paris with Jeanie, and he was described as her rock over and over again. The one person she could depend on when things got tough. The author even dedicated a few flashbacks and memories to establishing Ben as being strong. Unfortunately, the second the real disasters strikes all that melts away. As Paris crumbled around them, Ben slowly morphed from hero to whiny. He became the constant voice of dissent. The person who wanted Jeanie to leave everything and everyone behind and worry only about her how skinor essentially, to help Ben save himself. So in essence, the one character in the book I did care about, suddenly became the one who annoyed me the most.		Flashbacks in a story like this aren't unreasonable. In fact, I think they can be useful in character building. However, a lot of these flashbacks were not only ill-timed, but just pointless. We get that Jeanie cant get over her fathers death and that she feels guilty. It was mentioned a lot, so constantly rehashing it only made the story drag on. Plus, the group spent way too much time just sitting around talking while Paris fell around them. It was beyond ridiculous and unrealistic. Everyone else in the city was panicked and running around, trying to escape, yet Jeanie and her friends break into a restaurant to have a glass of wine. I didn't get it and it got old.		I wanted to find out what happened, I really did, but I was so tired of the group sitting around discussing what to do next or having the same argument over and over again that I had to skim a lot in the middle so I could get to where the story felt like it was finally moving forward again. Even then, I wasn't really invested.		Im not going to say this was a horrible book, it just wasn't the right book for me. I prefer a lot more character development and a lot less idleness. I felt like the story was really dragged out with chapters and chapters of little to no progress being made. The synopsis says that this book is for fans of The Walking Dead, but I disagree. Those of us who love TWD love it because of the wonderfully realistic characters and forward-moving plot, neither of which this book had.		I received copy of this book courtesy of NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.
1,I really looked forward to this book because I thoroughly enjoyed Savannah Frierson's book, Being Plumville.  I liked the fact that the male character was first generation Irish and that he was really into the female character but what made me not like the book is that I did not care for the main female character at all.  In fact, I could not stand her.  I thought she was emotionally immature, had low self esteem and kept on pushing back from being with Patrick so much that I wanted to scream at her.  I also was annoyed by the fact that she was bothered that her better looking friend Lois was getting male attention from a waiter.  I like strong heroines who may struggle with esteem and may have slight issues but have other redeeming qualities. I could not understand why Patrick liked Rosalyn so much but I did see why Rosalyn liked Patrick.  By the end of the book, she did get slightly better but I was already over it.  Hopefully, I am in the minority with my opinion.
1,The only thing English about this is the cover you see on the website.	The only riddle is - why the author bothered to write it at all.	There was no mystery; I have seen who is the murderer the moment that person appeared in the text.	A lot of confused thoughts and ideas - both from the narrator and from the "sherlock holmes". The detective is annoyingly amateurish, by the way.	All the characters appear to lack elementary communication skills, they all talk like primitive robots. None of them is likable.	I thought, while I was reading, a 12-year old must have written this as his school project...
1,I we would have liked some of the games.  There was no football other than practice and camp.  This book was boring nothing eventful or exciting.  I really didn't like resisting each other for the majority of the book predictable.
1,Nothing new. and by nothing new, I don't mean the fact that she just recycled 50 shades. I mean, she told us exactly what Christian was thinking in the first book and retold us in this one. If you do not know what Christian was thinking from the first three, you were not paying attention because she told us exactly what he was thinking. The only thing new is the child memories and an event here or there with Elliot.
1,I understand if this is the short book, but really...In this short pages, they are wasting times with things seems like not too important. At least I got this book for free
1,If you like BDSM, this is for you.  But for me, it didn't really deliver on romance at all.  The hero was too consumed with his own needs fhroughout most of the book.  The heroine was weak.  Neither character was well developed. He was not really alpha.  He didn't even really protect her from her parents or her enemies.  WEAK story.  WEAK character development.  But, lots of BDSM.  The author is definitely relying on this to sell her book.  Not enough story for me.  Especially since I just read a couple of truly five star stories by Pamela Clare.
1,Not great
1,it was good til the end just to find out al of that was a dream like really, i saw the ending turning out a whole lot better than that, such a disappointment.
1,Seriously there is so much that could been done to this story...but it's a hi sex babies.....no storyline in between.....so glad it was a kindle unlimited
1,Somewhat implausible, which is acceptable for an escape from realism, but many of the elements were somewhat unpleasant, not a positive element to escapism.
1,I did not like this book. Amazon won't let me say why. But I did not like it at all.
1,I have read all of the books of the series. This is the one I liked the least. The reason I s because the way they treated the hero. In the previous books his wife was killed(8 months previous to his story), they keep saying he should get over it and get with the heroine,when it obvious he is not ready. The heroine was unsympathetic to what happened to him(that turned me off). This is a pass for me.
1,I liked aspects of the book but the main character Ashleigh does not follow one social norm of the time period.  She is never chaperoned and most actions would have had her ruined in the first part of the book.  The lead male character is overall a jerk. If he was a better person the book would have been better.  I think the main character sliding down a bannister pregnant not understanding how this could be upsetting was the final straw for me.
1,Compaired to the first book this is terrible, it's like it was written by a different person, the character's are 1 dimensional the dialog between them is terrible I found myself skipping chunks of the book just to bypass all the dialog between the main protagonist and the other characters in the main settlement just skipping ahead to get away from the awful dialog, the first book was a bit cheese and melodramatic but it worked I don't know what happened to this book, this is the first kindle book I have ever returned for a refund.		I was really looking forward to this book as I enjoyed the first so much but was utterly disappointed I have read other books from the author and have enjoyed them  Heeley yes but it worked, please don't judge the author by this book he can do better.
1,I thought this book was all over the place. It was like she couldn't make up her mind and the end I just wanted to finish and still found it very disappointing. It wasn't anything like the first book. What happened?
1,I did not like this short story at all.  Even for a short story there was so much missing. Maybe a young girl would like it, but certainly not a mature woman.
1,It sucks
1,The writer has decided that if she tells us that this is a great love often enough through the characters we might believe it.  It doesn't work that way.  This is superficial, the characters have no appeal and the addition of Dalton seeing Rose as a child to explain things at the last minute is really sad, and I don't mean the cry tears kind.  It had promise but the style of the writing is also superficial and the books might have worked as one book instead of dragging out something for the sake of calling it a series.
1,This was my first book from this author. I truly enjoyed this book from start to finish. I look forward to reading more
1,Kind of mostly boring... I was just going through the motion but, I finish all my book. Why did this end at 51% then started a line of book snippets. Could have really done anything without the advertisements.
1,While Molly Masters' husband is overseas, she sets up a little home-based e-cards business. These she dashes off when inspiration strikes, which can be at any time or anyplace. I wish I could do that and make a living! However, e-cards take a back seat to solving a murder in her neighbourhood.  Molly is a likeable character, but slightly disorganized. A lot of the story revolves around food, (preparing it, delivering it and eating it), her friends, who somehow become involved in solving the murder, too, and local activities. Her children are ferried back and forth, pizza in hand, as Molly's investigations become more hectic. She sure is busy! A light read, just right for the bus or the beach.
1,Too much narrative. The interesting characters' actions didn't resurface until too late. I won't be lured into purchasing the next installment.
1,I LOVE Marie Halls Kingdom Series.  I even wrote on the calendar when this will come out.  The first half i was confused.  He was suppose to be with Chrysalis but he was falling in love with Lissa.  Then it started to make sense.  And I loved it but at the end...*SPOILER ALERT*... Lissa and Chrysalis are the same so he has to fall in love with both personalities.  It was really disappointed.  I'm hoping the next one will be better.
1,I should have known better than to download this one.  I hate horror movies, etc. and this one was so gory and disturbing, it makes me wonder what posessed people to create such evil reading.
1,i read alot of books and i didn't enjoy this as much i felt the story line was all over the place,
1,Everything about this book is meh.  No real character development. Story line, while it leaves you guessing, is very weak. All of it is unbelievable.
1,Just in the first 10% of this book there's just way too much going on.  I really lost interest in this very quickly.  I thought it was really odd that the writer said "God" gave her the idea for this vampire book.  Strange.
1,Very disappointing! I was expecting humor, but there were only 2 laughs in the whole book. All of the incidents are written in the author's voice which makes the book seem like fiction (bad and predictable fiction). As the author has arranged chapters of 'like' stories, each chapter is full of almost the same story with a few details changed. Except for skipping the raunchy 'sex' chapter, I read the whole thing. I still don't know why. I'm glad it was a freebie because it isn't worth even that.
1,The story just did not grab me.
1,did not realise it was comic and I cannot read comics as my eyesight is too bad
1,I would like to remove it from my Kindle.	Jabberwocky,  Nonsensical speech or writing. Illogical, a nonsense poem by Lewis Carroll.
1,First of all let me say that this is NOT a book, this is the beginning of the book. It does not have a full story and ending. It is the beginning of a story and ends abruptly in the middle. I hate cliffhangers and in my opinion this is even worse as it was no where near the end of a story when it ended but in the middle. Not that it was good book anyway. Xavier was extremely rude, I have no idea how someone who is supposedly a "strong" women would put up with his constant insults let alone fall for him. The story was told from her point of view and then repeated from his, but of course his was just for his lust interest in her. I would not recommend this to anyone I know nor would I read another work from this author. HORRIBLE
1,It was okay but not much like the previous parts of the story. This was all about the hero and his messed up life. He has a lot more issues than I originally thought and Layla is so strong to put up with him. I am glad their love is strong enough but he is always running away when things get tough. It got annoying and I was secretly happy he got hurt in the alley after that one fight. That sounds bad but he was so mean to break that vase of hers. He put her through heck and she fought for them all the time while he just pushed her away over and over again. It was not as good as I was wanting it to be and I was disappointed.
1,This series is getting to be too much. I'm not even interested in their relationship and sex life. I just wanna know who the killer is. This girl is ridiculous and nonsensical. The first few books were good.
1,This book makes some interesting statements but seems to be missing some connecting material. Some case histories and examples would help this book.  The Reference section seems to be incomplete as it points to no concrete reference material. In a few places the English is not quite correct. Better editing would benefit  this book.
1,I just couldn't get into this book. The story is so long and drawn out. I'm sure that it's a great story, but this author's writing style is just not for me.
1,This has got to be the most useless book I have ever read...and that is saying something		I know this book got published but a good read thru and a good editor would have been a VERY WISE investment.		It's hard for me give any credence to books that are poor in grammar.		For reference here's a lovely one:	"Since you've picked up a copy of this book, the chances are that you already know the importance behind this topic. Which shows just how great of a parent/caregiver you are and you're children are blessed to have someone like you in their life."		Grammatical errors run a muck and I can't stand when people don't know the proper manner in which to use the words: your vs you're		The content of the book is VERY VERY basic. Matter of fact, I could find more helpful information from a google search and that would be free. Fortunately, I picked this up on amazon when it was offered as a free kindle book and I had seen it on my recommended reading list or something		Maybe it's just me but I didn't care for the author's style of writing. It just seemed disjointed and didn't flow well from topic to topic. Imagine driving and someone slamming the breaks every block... that's how this writing felt.		A book about healthy eating for children would be more beneficial if it had more recipes in it. . . or even gave an example of a healthy menu for a day... etc etc		I can almost guarantee that whatever it is you're hoping to find in this book... won't be there.
1,Maybe I'm too old for this style of book. It's written with links to multiple outcomes so you can skip all over the place tracking down the story or maybe just customizing the story based on your choices. But my brain is too linear for that. I don't like choice when I read a book. I like narrative that goes steadily along from beginning to end. So while I suppose this is quite creative, it's also a pain in the neck to read. Normally I thoroughly enjoy Sara King's work, but this time I have to make an exception.
1,Couldn't finish this title.		You know how: Some people are instantly drawn together and remain friends for life. Others are instantly drawn together, have an intense but short lived relationship and, eventually, part ways. Some are repelled at first, but after time grow in friendship and understanding. And some people are just indifferent acquaintances and pass by one another with very little thought from either one.		I think it's the same with characters in books.		Laura and I just didn't click.
1,The story was trite and added nothing to the books.  I feel like the author wrote this in an hour, maybe while waiting to catch a flight or something.
1,Coonor was an abusive bully. That whole thing about restraining from punching her in the face - REALLY??? I wish I would have listened to these reviews instead of spending my money on this. Also agree - about the editing or lack thereof.	.
1,Somewhat interesting. Seemed like a lot of stuff ..big life problems were happening and yet there was a fluffy Christmas party...the ending was terrible. I see there is a sequel, but don't really care enough about the characters to bother finding out what happened to them. Not as good as her usual books.
1,I started this book but I could not finish it. I'm not sure if I give it time before going back and trying to read this it would be worth it. Way to much going on in the book to get me anywhere, dragged on too much.
1,The story was about temptation of another person while in a relationship while being outside your element. The couple was a mixed race of Mexican and American surfer and really only touched on their differences briefly. The lines and dialogue in this book where horrible and generic. I really suffered getting through this book to the end. I just never connected with them, she was immature and weak. The author tried to make it seem she was sensitive but she came off as self-centered.  The boy was no better in my opinion.
1,And you want to read one concept repeated in several sentences during the time that you are reading the book, than this might be the repetitive book for you.  It felt like the author wrote the book and then the publisher said that it needed to be five times longer, instead of adding any new ideas.  The author just added more words saying the same thing.  It reminded me of the kid in grade school who had a 500 word essay and just added words to bloat it.		And honestly, the language almost sounds like it was translated from another language or written by someone who English isn't their first.  I mean...maybe it is just me...but here is a quote:	  "...as she opened up her little corner of the world to Tony.  She decorated as nicely as she could.  There was something about having a nice home that was important to her and she didn't want to have a home that was meager.  She knew that there were alot of people that turned to a paupers lifestyle because they didn't think that they needed to decorate.  Lily had spent her meager budget on what really mattered.  She understood their was plenty she could do with a tiny budget; she just had to be smart.  She just had to make sure she bought things wisely."		So people who don't decorate chose to live like paupers?????? Huh?		And Her friend works at a bank.  The heroine says:		"...banks loved pretty girls behind the counter who liked to smile and make the customers happy.  It disarmed people and made them more comfortable.  It was a dirty trick, but most industries with a public face did the same thing."		Keep in mind that her friend is a bank teller, not a Hooters waitress.  I have never noticed that the tellers in any bank that I have ever been in have been, as a rule, exceptionally pretty or vivacious.  Maybe it is just the banks I go to.		I have to add a character description here:	I think this gives a good idea of the writing style.		"Peter was a handsome man and he knew it, but also used it like a crutch to get in the good graces of those around him.  He was a broad man with muscles wrapped around his tall figure and he dressed nicely, the kind of nice outfit you would expect someone who was doing much more with their life than he was to be wearing.  As far as he was concerned, though, he was an illusion of what he really did for a living.  He was the most interesting and peculiar of the group, but that was a dangerous kind of intrigue he carried.  In,  truth he was the kind of alarmingly exciting person that made the rest of them feel boring by comparison.  Peter was a private investigator.  He was the kind of person that relished his job and who loved every second of the danger that it put him in.  Sure he said that most of the time it was boring, but it sure did sound exciting and adventurous."		The characters are silly and one dimensional.	Then there is the plot.  They met at a bar and spent one night together.  Then two months go by.  They get back together and he is so smitten with her that he tells her he bought the business that they met at - in the off chance she will come back...they are both in wuuuvvv...there isn't even any lifemate or beloved or fated mate mojo to explain it.... The conflict really makes everyone in the book seem sleazy.  There isn't a single character that endeared his or her self to me.  And there were so many confusing things.  At the beginning she went to the bar because someone "called to her."  But this was never explained. What happens if a dragon and a wolf have a baby.  Is it a sphynx?  Is it a furry dragon or a scaly wolf?  I don't know if they were explained at the end, but I am two-thirds of the way through and still don't have a clue.		I gave up at 33%...and then forced myself to read to 64%  I don't know if I have the fortitude to go any further.  If I do I I'll update.
1,Too many layers weighed this down. Just bogged down with characters no one cares about.
1,There is no reason given here that they would want a menage.  The eroticism is okay but the motivations are questionable.
1,I thought this includes some steps in freeing your mind from thinking or worrying too much. This is just more about references to other book and quotes from someone else .
1,The main storyline was overall an interesting concept but I think the author fell short of making it an awesome read.....the author introduced a lot of different alien characters yet failed to really develop each one to a point where the reader totally understood who was who....were they "good" or "bad" ? Also the author introduced multiple languages, worlds, weapons and so on....which too were lacking in development....It seems the author wanted to include a lot of scenarios, etc...but didn't spend time on integrating them to make sure the reader knew their importance. On a final note, this is supposed to be for young adult....i would absolutely not allow any young adult to read. The main character is merely 17, gets drunk and has rough sex with an older man, then has sex with another within a matter of hours, ends up getting pregnant, contemplates an abortion...not to much alien orgies, these in no way add anything of substance to the store. Still believe that the main concept of the story is intriguing and very possibly could be an awesome read...but overall not developed enough to entice me to read the series...
1,Good plot but the story was just too weak to do it justice. The characters were childish and unrealistic. I was very disappointed because I expected better from Andrei's book.
1,Eh. I'm not usually one to set down a book, but I couldn't get past 13%. I feel like the author was trying too hard to make everything (including every single conversation) funny and every character was a stereotype. The boss's rich little daughter is silly and thinks that people without money are quaint, and "prides herself in being able to translate any housekeeper or subservient worker's tongue", all the rich kidnapee's family are stupid, loud, and hate each other. And the missing-persons cop that uses Confucius-speak? Incredibly annoying. What kind of private investigator in today's world doesn't know how to even work a cell phone, let alone own one? Probably not a very good one, but I'll never find out
1,This is okay, but I wouldn't recommend it.  I was reading it at work and hopefully my boss didn't see one of the chapter titles.  I was embarrassed, to say the least.  There are much better books out there, for sure.
1,I am truly surprised by all these 4 & 5 star reviews.  First, the editing needs a lot of improvement.  It started out really good and could have been a really good story but it went downhill fast.  First, Beau doesn't know if he is the father to Paisley's daughter, she has been with other guys, tells him he might not be the father.  He does whatever she says and takes the baby whenever she wants to party.  He is going to Monaco to race, so he hires a nanny.  In walks a sweet, naive young woman, surprise, they have insta-lust!  Paisley shows up warning the nanny about Beau and plays up their relationship for Landry to see.  Let's just say, I would never want a relationship with a man who still calls his ex 'honey', jumps every time she calls, and lives 4 doors down from her.  The end was ridiculous, Paisley is dying and tells Beau, who immediately puts her in his lap! that she set up the nanny for him and her daughter!  At that point the whole story just became too ridiculous!  Don't waste your time or money on this!
1,Julianne Spencer must have a very big family to get so many five star reviews. This book read like a review of obscure and well known books found on the kindle. While the premise was good, the story leaves a lot to be desired. She made the erotic scenes sound almost clinical. She threw out story lines as if she was being paid per book that she mentioned.	I read about 30% before I had to let it go.		There is no story here folks. I think Amazon might have actually wrote this. Don't waste your time reading this one.
1,I bought this and a Spanish / English dictionary for my Kindle fire thinking I could use the dictionary function like I do with the other Kindle books.		Kindle fire doesn't allow you to switch dictionaries.  Rats.
1,The author strikes me as a person that uses a thesaurus along side while he writes, as he believes using long and unused words make him appear more intellectual. So very sad that instead he comes across as shallow and pretentious. This book would even be boring for academia, let alone the general population.	He rehashes much of the known data while contributing little insightful or new ideas or information.	I read approximately ten to fifteen books a month. I pride myself on finishing a book once I have begun reading it. This book is one of two books that I have deemed not worth my time to complete.
1,Glad these were free even at that I couldn't bear to finish them !  No story line really like reading a low budget sex movie
1,This author could have done better! One of my least favorite plot devices is when a character does something that reveals them to be TSTL (too stupid to live). SPOILERS: When Jaime didn't call the police before driving over to see Alessandro getting beaten up by three guys, I wanted to throw my Kindle across the room in complete disgust. Anyone with an ounce of common sense knows that you call for backup before racing into a bad situation. This made Jaime look weak and ineffective, and I was angry on his behalf. I would haunt the author if I were that character! This book didn't do it for me at all; the only plus is that I was able to finish it. I have no trouble with the "gay porn", but going from virgin to three-ways and exhibitionism seemed a bit of a stretch in such a short period of time. I could forgive those problems, but the TSTL issue pushed me over the edge.
1,I did not like this one because of the "fleshyness" of it.  I did not finish it.  If the books contain swear words or sexy scenes, I won't read them.
1,This book could have been a really good read except for 1 thing --- Mia suffered brain damage and is like a child.  That was rather creepy. There were times when she seemed like she was under the age of 10 but at other times, her thoughts made her same older -- spoiler !!!! the part were her father is killed (and her father definitely needed to be finished off) she pats him on the chest and says bye bye --- there were so many parts that made her seem really young mentally that I could not root for them to be together ---- I was just too weirded out by the whole idea.  If Mia had not been child-like, I think that this would have been a good read ... I know I keep saying it, but it was just a little too creepy.
1,A total waste of time.
1,I forced myself to finish this book. I got bored with the hero (a future duke suffering from PTSD) about mid-way and skimmed through the last six chapters. The heroine was the Regency heroine, a little rebellious and ever the lady.  I wish there was more originality to the story to grasp my attention.
1,If your looking for a A A romance keep looking. I prefer that genre. This book was listed as such, so I chose it. NOT. It is a BMWW novel. It is mild pornography again not to my liking. Then the writer included the "N" word. I don't write it. I don't say it. And I Damon sure don't want to read it. Especially not in a romance novel. Sorry Natalie not reading anything by you again. On the other hand the storyline was good just turned me off with above.
1,I have enjoyed Sam's books in the past. If I had known it was a Dom sub topic I would of passed. I just wasted $4.99. Might see if I can get a refund.
1,Could not get into this book
1,This novel is written with extremely simple language.  Do not expect great literature.  Some will find the book suits them, while others do not recommend it.
1,I was expecting this to be a little more in depth than it was unfortunately. Anyone can make a list of jobs.....
1,What the heck was this? What kind of story telling was this? This was worse than Nine Minutes!		I think what author decided to do was to watch as many domestic abuse shows and movies as she could and compile a story from what she saw.		But seriously what the heck was this piece of garbage she threw together?		It sounded interesting in the beginning but I didn't pick up on her kind of story telling until really chapter nine. Within nine chapters she met this guy who got her out of legal trouble, stayed with him for nearly a month and then marries him.		That's the first nine chapters. It was stupid. He is hardly at the house and she just sits there and somehow gets attached to him anyways. They don't have a real interaction until he takes her out to dinner I think in chapter seven and then that night he goes to her room and they sleep together and then chapter eight is a summary of what happens after that but before they get married.		Then they're married and after a year of marriage out of the blue he turns abusive when she touches a guy after she spills water. He slaps her and then we fast forward to two months where, after the slapping incident, she no longer loves him and is turned off to any nice thing he does. It isn't until chapter eighteen that this suppose rape occurs. And even that like all the erotica scene is glossed over.		Just no. This book was just horrible story telling. Most chapters were just summaries of little events or acts of abuse that happened over time. And I honestly can't feel sorry for her. There's one dimensional characters and then there are these......point five dimensional characters.		This was just......I don't even know what else to say. I don't know whether to cry out of frustration or be freaking angry! How long is this horrible book spree I'm apparently on going to last?
1,Hated it.
1,I really liked the story line, but there are just way too many typos! Msg. Owens, please get a proofreader/editor fast... check out smith74lainey@gmail.com	Many times there were too many words turned around or added to make a sentence flow correctly. Not to mention the main character's name is Gabe not Gave. Or it should read she but instead read he. Very poor proofreading for a story that is really very good. The story was repetitive at times or stale, but this too could be easily fixed. I would really like to read book two but I don't want to spend money on a book that has typos on almost every page.
1,Simplistic, unbelievable plot. A fall head over heels for a man she doesnt know and quickly figure out he is a time traveler, all in the same day?  Others may like it, it's just not my cup of tea.
1,This book was very repetitive and the plot bordered on ridiculous. I never connected with the characters, they were both so obnoxious. There were quite a few typos in the beginning - I did not notice as many as the book went on but that may be because I was just skimming it.
1,In reality you cannot plan a wedding in one day. You cannot decide to relocate, sell all your things, rent and load a truck and move in one day. This story was a bit far fetched.
1,When you don't have another book to choose from...
1,Not a bad story concept, but the jumps where irritating. Needs allot more content and less 1 button solutions. Everything is 1 dimensional.
1,The idea of this book is appealing. Its very poorly put together though. The recipe instructions are incomplete. There are ingredients given but no instructions on how to prepare those ingredients. For example one cake recipe has two cups of almonds in it but nowhere in the recipe does it tell you to chop the almonds or grind them it just says add almonds. Well this recipe won't work if you just add whole almonds. It is a very disappointing book and I will avoid other books by this author because I don't want to be disappointed again.
1,Nothing in the review of this book led me to believe this was not a stand alone novel. After spending time getting into the book it just stopped leaving you wondering. I don't like series so this is one I refuse to buy into. Would have been good if it was complete.
1,I'm a huge fan of Lucia Jordan, but I must admit, I really didn't like this story line. Her style was still great, I just couldn't get into the characters. Blah
1,Poorly written many typos won't waste my money on a second book by this "author" (?) Where did the idea that this is a thriller come from?
1,Snowstorm.  Woman rear ends soldiers car.  They decide (rather stupidly) that the best idea is to trek through the woods.  Soldier is a jerk, woman cries, they find a cabin and have sex.  Then of course she invites him to have Xmas with her and her 5 year old daughter, because that's what you ask of random strangers with whom you've had a one-night stand.		It was free and there were no typos that I noticed.  I realize it's a short story, but there just isn't enough emotion to get me interested.
1,If you like romance with a bit of murder thrown in perhaps you will like this book. I despise when men lust after, to the point of almost drooling, anything that moves so when woman displays the same behavior I have to roll my eyes. Add to that the unbelievably factor where police officers invite just anyone into an investigation and I am ready to barf. Personally I like that other book collection Fatal Four much more, in fact I will go on to buy other books by those authors. Mirth, Murder and Mystery was a chore to read, truly I would have preferred to pick up trash alongside the road.
1,Cute story. Of or a novels but other than being in Sweetwater there's no other connection to the other stories
1,I have to start by saying that I LOVE Pride and Prejudice and have read it countless times over decades. In addition, I'm fond of alternate versions, and loved Pride & Prejudice & Zombies. When I heard of a modern retelling, I was eager to dive into it. Well, I dove in, and landed with a thud. The author may be a best-selling one. The modern skewering of such things as reality TV may be very clever. But I simply did NOT like this book as a version of Pride and Prejudice. I couldn't relate to the characters. If I have to dissect a novel, hoping to find the intelligent design, rather than enjoying the reading experience, the book doesn't work for me.
1,Uh Okay I don't know where to start. I actually started Magdas book with her Up Close and Personal. I loved it. It was standalone, straight to the point, mostly believable and had a definite HEA. I then continue with her Shattered series and it was okay. Oh, I follow her Italian Stallions series as well and it was good. I liked them so much. I knew that this Storm series is what people raved about but I didn't incline to try them. However, I tried this boxed set.		The premise of the series was that its a love story between a rich alpha male and a struggling beautiful female. Clich, thus I didn't take to it. However, with those raving from book fans, I thought there must be something different with the story, something special. Boy, did I disappointed. This is exactly that clich story, given some twist that rivaled telenovela/soap opera, and I hate telenovela.		The characters were not likable for my taste. The main male character (Gabriel) was just too obsessive, selfish and think the world of himself. The redemption was just a bit too late too little, IMHO. The main female character (Elizabeth) was immature, unbelievable, weakling and selfish. The other characters were fall under the same line. I actually skip chapters (a lot) as I couldn't stand to read them anymore. The hotness of the sex scenes could not compensate other flaws in the series because I saw sex scenes as spices only, the meat was should still in the story.		The only reason I gave 2 stars was to honor the hard work of the author, and I do really like some of her other works.		I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. I was not compensated for my review, and I was not required to write a positive review. The opinion expressed here is my own.
1,Nope.		I started out thinking I would like this. But it went downhill for me and I began to skim.		The plot surrounding the main characters became so Byzantine and murky that it just made me tired.		People monologued to death! These are some of the talkingest bikers. Jeez. Late in the book, River, the hero, gets a frantic phone call from the wife of his President of his club. She's sent him several 911 texts. It is an emergency, she needs his help. Does he rush out? Well he does, but first he talks for about 20-some pages. I was sure she'd be dead by the time he got there. Truly, if there was a tragedy or emergency these bikers would talk their feelings through it for pages and pages until you almost forgot what it was that started it.		The heroine Mia suffers a really horrific personal trauma at the start of the book. There is an eight year time jump so it makes sense that she is physically recovered from it. And yet, as the book goes on I couldn't help but feel that the initial trauma was presented mostly for shock value to damsel her. There is never any reference to her receiving any real counseling or how she recovered psychologically from it. The personal trauma is instead transmuted into an issue of physical safety. The villain is after her again and she wants to run away from him, but we are never treated to any insight into Mia's though process about how this is affecting her psychologically, no flashbacks, no PTSD, no nightsweats...nothing. Her tormenter is basically reduced to nothing but a run-of-the mill romance novel stalker.		After awhile the dialogue just felt repetitive.		The bikers & their environment came off as being very dirty.  Not in a sexy way but in a not clean or hygienic way.  As i read the book I just wanted to transport myself inside and wash everything.		I lost engagement rather quickly.		On a fun note, though, some version of F-word was used 1,068 times in this book. Awesome! (not really because most of the dialogue was just that word strung together with every other curse word to make a curse word salad).  Seriously, there were whole sentences on every page where almost every word was a profanity.		This had the potential to be a good story but it really wasn't
1,I started reading this series like a year ago, and at the time I loved it!  The characters were interesting, they had unique personalities and I enjoyed reading about them as they survived the zombie apocalypse.		***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***		But when I got to then end of Chapter 29, I couldn't read anymore.  The author did something that I really didn't like and that made me lose interest in this series.  I have been reading this series for a total of like 600 pages and now I really have no desire to read it anymore.  Once I finished that chapter I decided I was done with this series.  The build up to this chapter was okay and I enjoyed that part, but for me the book ended at 50% through the book.		***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***		These books had a good run, but this is where I get off and look for something else to read.
1,Utterly ridiculous.  I just can't fully express the level of complete nonsense that this book achieved. Just dont!
1,Don't bother buying this book, it's nothing more than marketing teaser junk. I would be ashamed as an author to put stuff like this out. Watch out for the other (still pre-order) "3 books for 2.99" piece of junk that comes out in November (Angle of Investigation).		I got sucked into buying both as a long time Connelly / Harry Bosch fan, but was able to cancel my other "3 books" just now to avoid the pain. I've also asked for a refund for this one, since I think it's blatant false advertising.		For the record, I've read and enjoyed ALL the Harry Bosch books in hardcover, rereading them multiple times. I like them so much for escapism that I thought it was great that I could get them on my Kindle.		Boy was I unpleasantly surprised.		If you like reading a few pages that go nowhere for a few bucks, then this marketing teaser junk might be for you. But it's sure not for me.
1,I was very disappointed in this book, it was not nearly as good as part one. It really didn't have much of a story line and the story line that it did have was put to the side for all the sex rah and deena was having. That's what the book basically consisted of. You couldn't go one chapter without them having sex. I get they are in love and it's a new relationship but how many times do I need to read about them having sex? It's like the author didn't have anything to write about so the book was filled up with sex to take its place. I didn't realize this had turned into an erotic book. It took to long to get to the point. I kept waiting for the book to pick up and I realized I was 62% into the book and nothing was still happening. I wish the author would have focused more on deena's case and the shady fried nah nah, cashmere, Kylie, doc and the informant. Instead the author jumped all over the place with it or would start on it in a chapter but then nothing else about it in the next. It jumped right back into the sex. I could care less about ma lique, Angelique, Sam and the other non factors. I was disappointed all the way around. The ending sucked. It ended way too fast. I'm glad there is not a part 3 to this book. I don't know why the author made a part 2, especially since the book didn't really focus on the storyline. This book was mainly about sex between rah and deena. The rest was thrown in to finish the book. A bad end to a good start.
1,another kids' book
1,I stopped reading this. I hated how the female offered herself to the guy and just didn't care if he was married or not blantly said so. She was willing to be a mistress,the other woman, a homewrecker. So not interested in finishing. I don't care how good the book is after the chapter I read.
1,save your time and your money
1,Let me say right off that I couldn't finish this, so I can't really comment on the story.  I'm writing a review because I'm mystified as to why a person would choose to become an author when they cannot use the language in which they write.  Ms. Curry, grammar is our friend.  Punctuation marks help us keep track of important things, like who is speaking, or when a clause or a description has come to an end.  I don't mind taking a moment after each sentence to ponder its meaning when I'm reading Kierkegaard or Proust.  Since this was intended to be a frothy romantic diversion, it annoyed me and wasted my time to finish a sentence and think "What the hell . . .?"  I gave up after about three pages, as the weight of the content and the effort required to read it were completely out of balance.  And in this case, the convoluted and nonsensical nature of the writing cannot be blamed on formatting errors - it's simply poor craftsmanship on the part of the author.  The sad thing is, there's nothing here that couldn't be fixed by a quick skim through a fourth-grade grammar textbook.  So if you're not willing to hire an editor, please, Ms. Curry, brush up on the rudiments of English usage, turn on your spell-check, and try again.
1,Too boring . the hero was super indecisive!!
1,Story tubes details, the climax was two pages and lacked any real depth. Adrian never put up any real dislike to moving in with the Lions once he arrived. Instant attraction with no obstacles. Last 25% of the book are "Samples" which gives this book a false sense of more content.
1,the story did not keep my interest, the characters very one-dimensional and the conversations made no sense half the time. I kept feeling like I was reading a "second" book with the same characters because the author talked about them all working together before so I felt I was missing something in the story.
1,I down loaded this freebie because I  had a recommendation for this author  and I wanted to  try her out.  I ended up skimming the book.  While the story line had potential, the writing is not good.
1,The characters did not have much depth and story predictable. Seem like a good beginning outline for a TV movie. Found myself skipping along trying to move the story line along.
1,The squares shown are beautiful and the uses they can be put to are good. There is something missing though: PATTERNS! Not even the basic granny square has a pattern, let alone the more complicated like a star in the center. You get suggested hooks, yarn weight and (sometimes) color suggestions.
1,I wish I had read the other reviews first.	The only thing I keep thinking is: "I can't believe I read the whole thing!"  The characters are incredibly boring and stupid (Camryn especially!!)  Basically anything dumb she can do, she does!  From getting into a car with a complete stranger, to going for a walk in the DARK night AFTER she was scared to death by a wild animal following her home!  Who DOES that!?!?		IF the plot was halfway decent I might have just not even bothered to leave it a review at all and just leave it to other readers to decide, but even that was choppy and boring (besides not making a whole lot of sense).  As it is I feel the need to warn people not to waste their time with this book!		Please do yourself a favor and pick another book.  I'd almost bet the "5 Star" reviews were paid for.... there is just no way this deserves them!
1,A good premise, but it felt like the writer got bored by writing the book and decided to skip ahead to the happy ending portion.
1,This was  not a western fiction just a cheap slit story who gets his rocks off by writing of his  fantasy s. Not much of a western just filth. Will not read any more of his junk
1,Very short - thankfully. Not badly written, just not particularly interesting
1,But wow. This suffers not only from its length, which should have been at least tripled to make it any better, but there are abounding typos and flawed prose. A hyphen is not a comma. I liked the premise, but it was nowhere near executed. Shame.
1,I am so disappointed in this collection! .but only because I LOVED it and was heart broken that when I finished it there was a huge cliffhanger. But also because when I went to get the next book I found out that there is 21 books to purchase in this series! Each book cost 4.99. SERIOUSLY. That's 104.79$ I would never spend that much on 1 series! And it's ASHAME , because it was a GREAT story line! Now I will NEVER know what happens.
1,I really wanted to like this book -- and I'm sure I would enjoy having a cup of coffee with Ms. Greenfield in an RV park somewhere -- but this book just didn't deliver on its promise of being a guide for "sassy gals" who want to take the road full-time. It was primarily a short, high-level summary of tips for those who want to travel in an RV. And unfortunately, there are plenty of better, more detailed books on how to do that.
1,Getting kind of weird. I don't think I like it. Jumps around a lot. Does not make a lot of sense to me.
1,This series was kind of confusing. Crazy family dynamics that are never quite explained and they keep getting weirder. Bi-polar characters that just get worse. Best part of the book was.............the end. It ended as a cliffhanger and for once I don't care because it finally ended.
1,Waste of paper, too short and no offence to the writer it was like I was reading some wird fairy tale. Thisngs were just too unreal, beyond unreal as to the rules and plausability.
1,I didn't like the Heroine, she came off as thinking she was better than the other people. Just didn't connect with the her, but I liked Cesar, for that reason I give it a 2 1/2stars  Other than that it was okay.
1,This story started out good and had a lot of potential, but then it fell apart. Still, I tried and read to about 90%, skimming most of it since I just couldn't get into it, and then returned it for a refund. You have to truly be disappointed to suffer through 90% of a 5000+ location story to give up, but I did and it was because I knew the ending didn't matter to me. I didn't like any of the characters and I didn't care what happened to them. Kerry started pathetic and improved marginally by the end, but it was pointless. I think the author was going for a story like Riley Hart's Broken Pieces, but these men did not grab you, did not make you root for them and did not make you love them individually, as couples and then as a mnage. I didn't see/feel connection between/among the men. It's also unclear whose story this is. The man you see on the cover with the cuts on his side is Malcom, the Dom in the relationship, but his and Charlie's story is told in 3rd person while Kerry's is told in 1st person. Frustrating and confusing. It's well-written and if you can identify with one of the men you might like it. There hadn't been any sex among them by 90% in, Charlie and Malcom had a couple unimpressive sex scenes, so you probably get the mnage scene towards the end if you're lucky. The author came up with a good premise and can write, but the execution ruined the story. I will give this author another chance, but I cannot recommend it.
1,The dialogue  just did not flow for me.  Several sentences are similar to a wrong note in a song.  Samantha, a lawyer from DC and Roger, an architect/handyman meet in Texas.	They do not get along at first but eventually they call a truce and agree to go out.  One example of a wrong note is when Samantha has a wardrobe/vehicle dilemma:		"I wonder what he will be driving?" Samantha thought to herself.  "The only thing I've seen is the truck.  If that is the only thing he has, then it will be what we go out in.  I won't embarrass him by suggesting we go in my car."		I was  halfway through the book before I gave up on it.		Remember, this is my opinion and does not reflect on the author.
1,Tried to use it and had nothing but trouble.  It may work fine on the newer Kindles but on my very old one it is worthless!!
1,Very slow I nearly did not finish reading. Not what I expected, by the time I started getting interested, I reached the end.
1,not even worth the 2 minutes it took to read. All common sense stuff that everyone over 25 should already know. A good primer for someone who is 18 and just starting out but for someone who is serious about maximizing his/her finances, don't bother. There's nothing new or specific in here. Max out your 401K, spend less than you make, pay off your credit cards every month, pay off high interest cards first, don't overspend. There - I saved you the time of getting the book.
1,*Spoiler Alert*		*Sigh*	I went in wanting to like this, thanks in part to the opener with two werebears practically destroying a kitchen in their quest to eat. It was funny, and I had hoped that the comedy would have continued throughout the story. I liked the banter between Conner and Rebecca as they collected edible plants in the forest, and I also liked the Trivial Pursuit game between Sydney and Angie.	The rest of the book...bleh. I found the premise of three women meeting their shifter mates all at once a stretch. The fact that none of the three women really freaked out upon seeing the werebear transformations, but immediately jumped the guys bones and went along with the mate stuff made me shake my head...I found myself reading yet another shifter book of insta-sex, insta-love... I get the whole 'know your mate and bond forever' theme, but dammit, it would have been nice to actually have more interactions between the characters than just the sex.	1.75 stars.
1,I like dark romances once in a while, that's why I downloaded this one...but there had to be some redeeming qualities in the hero and this guy just didn't have any.  Even after he found our heroine was abused and lied to her whole life, even after her life was in danger, he was just plain mean and nasty to her and blamed her for everything.  And then she fell in love with him???  Nope, don't buy it.		Our heroine was treated as Cinderella by her Aunt and Uncle, abused and unloved her whole life, and yet the second she gets away from them she turns into a shrew?  Acting like and treating people like her cousin treated her?  Nope, don't buy it.		Very disappointed in this one...and it had such great potential.  NOBODY grew emotionally.  Nobody redeemed themselves.  Nobody had a brain their head.  Our heroine was supposed to be this intelligent person, and yet she did some of the most idotic things throughout the book.		Don't waste your time or money...just not worth it.
1,Had major editing problems. Many times you needed to guess what the sentence actually said. I almost quit reading after a few pages,but the story sounded interesting. It's a good first maybe second draft,but definitely not finished. In many place time jumps days and you have to figure it out yourself. Many places need lots more detail or Information. I think with some more work this could be a pretty good book.
1,This was just okay.  The st book in this series was better written. I waited 2 yrs. for this book and wss a little disappointed. The story line was rushed, jumping from one thing to the next. No consistency with the story telling. There  was  lack of substsnce to this story. I have read most of Ms. Thomas ' s books, but this one did not measure up. The character of Ethan  was portrayed ss whiny and boring. Too much complaining about  being  abandoned by his mom, not wanting children, blah, blah, blah. He was about 26 -27, and acted as if he were 3 yrs. old. I give Jordin credit for hanging in there  and fighting  for the man she loved. At the same time, taking a stand on him being unwilling to face his past , so that he could move on with his future .  The dialogue  was too repetitive , being that Ethan  was repeating the same thing over and ovet, until midway  through  the  book.	I hope the next one will be better written .
1,Wish he had a real book about Dresden out!
1,This book says NOTHING that the author's previous book didn't already say. After reading that title, I followed every bit of advice to the letter and saw ZERO results. I was excited to see this title, thinking this would have that specialized info I must've been missing to sell not just fiction, but romance, but I couldn't have been more wrong. I suspect the author cut and paste his previous book, added a new forward and changed the cover and title.
1,I hate fantasy, and I didn't realize from the book description it was fantasy. Two pages in is as far as I got.	I have no judgment on it as a Fantasy novel.
1,They all say the same thing. But it's only going to work if the ex wants you back. You can't control other people's actions or emotions.
1,I felt like the verbs were way too demanding of a loving relationship that ed being portrayed. I also had a problem that the old show don't tell rule want followed as if we are nearly being told what to feel for the characters instead of growing the reader character relationship that makes the greats great.
1,Too dark, violent and disturbing for me. If you're into such, then it's a book for you.
1,A lot of sexual fantasies and actual explicit sex, otherwise it was just an OK read, sorry to since this is a genre that I really like
1,I completely disagree with all these 4 & 5-star reviews.  Not only are the reviews misleading, but so is the book description. This book was disenchanting and forgettable.		It's the story of a prostitute who's "retired" to become a Madam, then returns to prostitution to repay her father's gambling debts and to secure his release from his kidnappers.  I felt no compassion for the heroine and couldn't connect with either her or the hero in this book.  Other books with similar heroine's usually explain the reasons behind involvement in prostitution; in this book, she simply says she didn't have any other choice - that is just not good enough.		She repeatedly refers to her striking beauty and confidence which no man can resist, yet (1) we get no description of her; and (2) she's insecure through half the book. I also hated how she contradicted herself in every other sentence.  e.g."I had no idea where I was going, but I had an idea, and that was a start" - I get this sentence, but it's just painful to read.		Then she becomes obsessed with a guy whom she finds "creepy" through 2/3 of the book, then all of sudden they're both insanely in love even though they know nothing about each other.  There is absolutely no basis for the instantaneous realization that they love each other. The guy acts like a jerk half the time, then becomes a dream catch.		I pat myself on the back for being able to get through this book since I kept checking how far along I was about every 2 minutes or so.  I definitely will be skipping the rest of the series, I have absolutely no interest in knowing any more about these characters.
1,MEH
1,This brief story had too many poorly defined, unbelievable and aggravating aspects in the plot, the action & the world build. I found many of the story foundation points icky & the reactions of the H & h unrealistic to the mad scientist impregnation. The ending was too abrupt & the epilogue odd in all the points it wrapped up too pat-ly. No secondary characters were introduced that interest me to read more in this series.
1,Good story and interesting world if only they would not repeat their titles over and over gets exhausting. Stories are very long.
1,I am sorry to say that this was one of the poorest written stories I have ever read.  I am speaking of the actual writing, not the story.  I was unable to concentrate on the story because of the lack of writing skill.  Where was the editing for this book.  I like that Christians write books, but at least use proper verb forms,  good grammar, and sentence structure.  The scripture for chapter 2 said it was Psalms 26, it was really Psalms 25.	I did like that scripture was used at the beginning of each chapter.	Sorry, I would not recommend this book.
1,A reasonable amount of character development and the story line is not as predictable as it appears. Some issues are mentioned and left, and a few are resolved. Sexual activity and descriptions are sometimes physically inaccurate and sometimes only fantasy.
1,The Mountain Shadow is the much anticipated follow up to Shantaram, appearing more than 10 years after Shantaram found wide acclaim. It is a tome  nay, a mountain of a book  at well over 800 pages, and it will inevitably invite comparison with the latter, as Lin, once again, is the main protagonist, together with some of the characters from the first book. There is still Leopold, the real life caf in Colaba (its strapline: getting better with age) where many of the characters still hang out.		Lin is now working for the Sanjay Corporation creating forged passports. Bombay is full of mafia style operations, all vying for business and power. He has one final task to fulfil for his old boss Khaderbhai, down in Sri Lanka and thereafter he will be a free man to pick and choose his own path. But with Lins history of violent encounters is this purely a pipe-dream?		In the first book Karla with the green eyes was Lins huge love but when the story picks up in The Mountain Shadow, he is living with Lisa. However the shadow of Karla hangs heavy over his new couple relationship and the cracks begin to undermine any chance of something longer term.		The book is populated by a mle of exotic Moulin Rouge-style characters  Madame Zhou and her henchmen from Shantaram, for example, are still around. Lin is still trying to make good but he grapples with his irascible temperament and finds himself in many a scrape, caught up in the violence perpetrated by The Cycle Killers and general gangland warfare. At times, it certainly brings the Dan Dare out in him.		There are many subplots and encounters going on to keep the entertainment flowing. Overall a rich stage of characters, settings and action.		So, does this sequel work? The lyrical quality of the first book is still evident in parts and the prose can still assault the senses: The allure of the perfume gave way to the sugared sense of firni, rabri, and falooda sweet shops. The glittering splendor of bangle and bracelet shops surrendered to the gorgeous fractals of Persian carpets.. The author does indeed know how to write a story, evidenced by the success of Shantaram. But in this book the construct slides across the pages, delving into the dark souls of the gangs, rather like a Hieronymus Bosch painting, then rising to quasi-philosophical heights, Idriss atop his mountain holding court with Lin and Karla in attendance.		The narrative relies heavily on dialogue between the characters to move the story forward  perhaps 70% of the book, at a guess, is speech, which actually can be quite a labour to read  and tedious. It is also punctuated by innumerable quotes and aphorisms that left me scratching my head: make what you will of Fear is a wolf on a chain, only dangerous when you set it free or living alone as a freelancer in Bombayis a cold river of truth and My happiness was a cheetah, running free in a savannah of solace and Happiness abhors a vacuum to Love and faith, like hope and justice, are constellations in the infinity of truth. Oh, and crime is feudal, indeed; but you no doubt get the drift.		Ultimately there is a fair amount of drug use throughout the book, but the chemical rides are clearly much more entertaining and enthralling to the characters themselves than they are to the reader looking in. Shantaram was a tightly woven page turner. The Mountain Shadow is a loosely woven series of chapters (91 in all) that sadly freeloads on the success of the first novel.		It is apparently the second book in a trilogy, so heres hoping that there is a return to form in book number 3.
1,This is obscene of author. Few pages of current book which is really a chapter, then rest of this one is repeat of books starting with chapter one. Crazy rip off.
1,I liked the first book enough to buy this one although there definitely were not any laugh-out-loud moments in either one.  Disappointingly, Jane's character is more of a ditz in this book; the store confrontation was just way over the top for me and became even more distasteful in subsequent chapters.  There isn't anything I like about Martin's character or Jane's reaction to him.  The series started with promise but fizzled out for me; I won't be reading anymore Death Diva sleaze-ventures.
1,It might me a good story line but I couldn't get past the foul language so I only read 12 pages....and I figured that if there is a big fat typo on the very first page (the prologue), that the book more than likely has lots more...........sorry
1,Started reading this and abandoned it. Think I need to stop trying to read this genre ; there is a sameness and very little depth.
1,I can't imagine how anyone found this hot.. I equate this to rape and disgusting.. I like a M/m story but this was not erotic or good
1,I would've liked this story so much if it wasn't for the heroine. While you sympathize with Jessica's plight working for a horrible boss at first, you also get the feeling she's very ungrateful. Instead of dumping her boyfriend, she lies to him about everything and it makes it hard for the reader to root for her when you can predict she's going to end up with Blake in some form. Even Jessica herself said Greg was a great guy and his only major issue was jealousy.		I got 36% into the book and realized I couldn't finish this. I do not recommend.
1,I read most of this series but didn't finish it. The heroine keeps a lot of secrets from the hero who is really into her. She is a real slut and there are numerous sex scenes that aren't hot. The hero was not alpha or possessive which is what I was looking for. In fact, he acts too much like a girl, constantly worried about if the heroine likes him. Meanwhile, other then sleeping together, there is no chemistry between them.
1,This book is awful. The writing is stunted and juvenile. I would not recommend it too my friends and I won't be buying another book from this author.
1,So bored I can't seem to finish.
1,I really loved TE Woods other books in this series, so I bought this one.  I'm sorry to say, I was disappointed.  I skipped through this book to read about the "Fixer" as the story about the gangs just frustrated me.  Sorry!
1,I'm glad I read this on kindle unlimited this book was torture.  As the chapters went on the author kept reintroducing the characters as if you were reading the second series in the book and not a new chapter. This book needs slot of work, I'm to frustrated to even talk about the other disasters in the book. Please save your money and time.
1,It's hard to imagine the same author wrote this book.  So many things didn't make sense.  The hero was 100% on the side of the heroine but took a stranger's word over hers, after almost an entire book of something else.  Half stories that still didn't make sense after the explanation.  He practically beat her at the end, he was a creepy stalker and she allowed it. Just not a good, well flowing book.
1,I have to admit I'm cheap and I usually look for free books. So I rad some pretty bad stuff. But this one is truly terrible. I couldn't even make it to the second chapter. The sentence structure is terrible as well as the grammar and word use. And good gracious. If every sentence is going to start with the characters name please make it a better name. Ugh. Keelin this. Keelin that. Blah. How about using she. We know who you're talking about. I do not recommend.
1,An okay book. No plot no back story nothing interesting besides the sex. Even the sex was mediocre. A lot could have been done with this story.
1,I give this book 2.5 stars.		This was my first read by this author.		I enjoyed the plot of this book but for me it was lacking a connection between the characters, I couldn't connect with them. The sex scenes came across as awkward and uncomfortable. I also struggle with the book being narrated. I like when books are told in the POV of the main characters.
1,If you're going to write historical fiction, you should have at least a smidge of knowledge about the time period. This book has the heroine's brother, a baron, arrested and imprisoned by the local magistrate on suspicion of murder. This isn't a minor detail; it's the crisis that drives the entire plot. However, the author never bothered checking the privileges of the peerage, one of which is that no peer, including barons, can be arrested or imprisoned except by an act of the House of Lords. Which means that the entire story is based on a plot hole big enough to hide the Prince Regent and all his mistresses! Also, with no explanation at all, the heroine is not capable of speaking, acting, or thinking like a woman of her class and seems entirely unfamiliar with the rules of etiquette. I don't mind a heroine who deliberately breaks the rules when she finds it necessary, but Mandy seems to have been raised in a gambling hall rather than a respectable country estate.
1,It was a good book, but I do not like any bad language; frankly, I was surprised that an Amish book had any in it.  I have always enjoyed reading them.  Dam, hell, etc. used as bad words are bad language to me.  I am a Christian and will not purchase any more books by this author.
1,Husband and wife preppers from Detroit do what it takes to be ready for SHTF event.  When it actually happens (highly contagious worldwide plague wiping out most of humanity), they load up all their gear and head deep into the north Michigan woods to get away from infected people.  Their strategy works good until they go completely braindead and decide to leave their perfectly safe haven and drive to.....of all places..... New York City (a hotbed for the plague).  You got to be kidding!		Although the story pretty much lost me right there,  I went ahead and finished the book because it's a very quick and easy  read, and you can do a lot of skimming (and never miss anything important). I skimmed a LOT!		In addition to the amateur storyline and character development, proofreading/editing is nonexistent.		I won't waste any more time or money with this series.
1,again to many mistakes
1,Anyone who gave this series more than one star must be into pre-teen drama. I read the first book and was not impressed (blatant FSOG copy) but I had already purchased the second (based on the stellar reviews, shame on me) so I continued. What a mistake, there is over six chapters of full on mind game tantrums from Colton and Rylee. This series drags and they barely have a connection as it is but when the crap hits the fan it is full on junior high antics, lying, kissing someone else in front of the other, pretended to pick up a guy at a bar to induce a fight, and some of the worst drawn out, frustrating, lazy writing by the author to create the most juvenile drama. The steamy scenes are boring filler that I skipped through because there's no emotional connection.		I can't stand either lead character, Rylee has a degree in psychology, a grown up educated woman in charge of a bunch troubled boys but she acts like she's twelve years old emotionally. Colton had a seriously screwed up childhood so he has a little bit of an excuse but both of their behavior and actions become so ridiculous that you don't care. At least five times he comes to talk to her putting his foot down on settling their argument only to have Rylee scream, cry, run away, foot stomp, create a scene (believe me Colton does his fair share as well) to prolong the separation. It is so sad.....I am getting my money back. Complete waste of time!		People....really four and five stars!?! To each his own and all that but this series is awful. Don't waste your time.
1,No plot just one night of hot sex, that's all there is to this short story. Not sure why this story was necessary. Maybe I'll know in the novels that I will read next.
1,The writing is good. The world is complex and interesting. However, it contains abuse of women and lots of violence. These are not things I enjoy in romance but I know others don't mind.
1,I personally did not enjoy this book. I could. Not understand how peters parents couldn't communicate. With each other. Wierd
1,The story started off great and the plot behind it all quite inventive however execution wasn't as good.		Its starts with a kiss and boy o boy what a kiss!!!		An story of lust, love and overcoming challenges, with some time travel thrown in.		Thane is all rugged and sexy.		Celine is sad and trusting.		Fast paced and exciting.		However it felt like a movie where bits a left out and left for your own imagination to figure out. And ended quite abruptly without any real explanation as to how or what will happen.		I did feel that the authors style was clever enough to detract you from the fact that that really was a confusing story and jumped so many times with little character development to get a feel of both characters stories, and all the covert stuff felt like filler rather than a part of the story. Then I am confused as to weather the romance part is the main story or the filler.		I don't know if this is a series but I would like to continue on when the next few are out, mainly to see if Thane and Celines story actually gets more information out there.
1,I hoped this volume would deliver as to the title promise. But, no!  It is just another ill conceived marketing campaign designed to sell his other items. This person writes well. Better than most of the "e-book millionaire crowd. But rather than providing anecdotal cheats, tips, or hints....behold a ramble about Apple computers and a copy of the Nuance Short Cuts that is enclosed in your copy of their Dragon Naturally Speaking software. How do people sleep nights after shoveling such unmitigated BS on the buying public????????
1,I skip thru most of the book, she gave up a good life for a no nothing behind dude that don't care about her, all he did was played her like before. And in the end she ended up alone with no one to be by her side in her time of need.  I wasted my money on purchasing this book.
1,Can't say I would recommend this book to anyone. Very shallow characters and unbelievable situations. Poorly written. Very disappointed in it.
1,This is a really great series. I read this series  about a year ago and decided to go back and reread it starting with the soul-linked series. I decided to skip this book in the re-reading of this series. This book is not the greatest. I am unhappy that her original 3 mates die and is replaced with a single man. It's just ok. Honestly I think  the rest of the books will still make sense without it. There is a prologue that is important but after that start book 2. The series gets way better.
1,This set of ideas needs a great amount of grammar corrections. It reads as though it has never been proofread.
1,I love Donna Grant 's Highlanders so I was very disappointed in this sweet little story. Why?  Fourteen pages were missing from my Kindle copy !  In the telling of such a short tale, that is a HUGE gap !  Warning.!!!! Do not purchase the e-book.  Do not get it for free either.  What is the point of reading a good story when it's guts have been ripped out ?
1,I didn't like this book enough to be able to finish it. Could be my failing, though ... I just don't like books about criminals. I was doing pretty well with Analise's side of the story, but then it would switch to Roderick's and I didn't want to read any more.
1,When I saw it was a complete trilogy I was very excited to have a nice long read.  What I wasn't expecting was two million sex scenes (okay, I exaggerate a bit) with a bit of story in between them.  If I were to make a suggestion it would be to leave out the majority of the sex and concentrate more on the characters.  I found them a bit two-dimensional and as a whole I was disappointed.
1,I tried to this book, several times. Finally, around 30%, I just stopped. The main male character is a egotistical jerk. He seriously annoyed me. The main female character sounds like a teenager with a crush and is bland. At 30%, the main characters have only interacted with each other once but we did get to read about the man whore sleeping with someone else. I will not be reading this author again.
1,Another "Sorcerer's Apprentice" hack job. Full of concocted statistics without context, without describing the population and the sample the studies examined, and without telling the reader about the control group(s). Spar just machine rattles off numbers without telling the reader whether or not the studies have been vetted for validity, reliability, not historical benchmarks.	Statistics may suggest a high correlation, but hardly causation. This is "pseudo-science" at its worst, but it certainly gives credibility to the term "junk science." Spar still doesn't tell us why Abramson was let go.
1,just okay
1,Not my cup of tea!
1,Not well edited or written.  One more sentence about British man O' wars instead of men of war would have had me yelling at an inanimate object.  A woman as assistant editor of Washington's second largest newspaper in 1814 seems unlikely.  The very few women who ran newspapers in that era tended to do so by inheriting the paper.  How anyone could make a small boat action by civilians against a British warship dull and uninspiring is beyond me but Mr. Rossignol does it.
1,The female in this story got on my nerves. Too silly. There just wasn't much depth to this story either.
1,Don't waste the time...just buy or borrow one of the books.  This sampler doesn't do anything for the reader.
1,No thanks.
1,I liked the story, I just feel that the beginning could have been better. Gabriella rolled over with no resistance or indignant outrage when informed of her impending fate with Kitteridge. The story line gets better and has a great ending, just a weak start.
1,Not  what I was expecting .  Was disappointed with the book. Strong language,  and was more about getting it on than a good story plot. In fact scrolled through from chapter 10 just to get to th end.
1,No I didn't, I barely even finished the thing.		The problem with reviews is that everyone has their own taste in reading material, but few reviewers tell you which camp they fall into. I'll say upfront that I like darker, heavier romances with a good bit of steam (read hot s$x) and spanking thrown in. I'm a single woman...it keeps me off the streets. The other problem with reviews is that someone is critiquing the plot versus the quality of the writing. I'm delving more into the plot in this review.		This book is a light read, has virtually no sensual overtones, let alone any hot and heavy...interludes.  I hated it.		I couldn't relate to the heroine of the book; after 10 years of marriage and finding her husband cheating on her. She's also lost both parents at an early age, and had to deal with some ugly family business with her stepmom (I think that's what happened, I was already skimming.)  After going through all of this, I think she'd be a little more battle worn and knowledgable about life. She's described as wholesome and innocent, and I couldn't buy that in someone who'd gone through what this chick had been through.  She was still a girl to me, not a woman, and honestly she came off as pretty stupid.  There is a fine line between wholesome innocence and too stupid to live...sadly this one didn't make it across said line.		The hero, who has to have one of the worst names ever given to a romance hero, was supposed to be a big shot movie producer. As with the heroine, he was far too sweet for someone in his line of work and at his age. I just couldn't buy into them as real people or as an eventual couple.		There was a large cast of characters, including the token gay friend, and a few other males interested in the heroine (because she was so wholesome and untainted) -- I guess it was an attempt to make us worry that she wouldn't choose the hero. One poor guy who is used as a trite writing technique also has one of the most currently overused hero names inundating romance readers (and for some reason, motorcycle clubs) as well. Honestly people, do not use this book to look for awesome naming conventions for men/boys. Unless you're partial to the names Sebby and Declan.		I did a quick skim through the entire last half of the book, it just wasn't my thing.  It was slow paced to the point of boring, and not a whole lot goes on. Everything about it was just too predictable and ... stupid. I can't even tell if the writing was good or not, but if you like wholesome and innocent, then you might really enjoy this cup of tea.
1,I was so annoyed by Emily that it pretty much ruined the book for me.  She's engaged to Nicholas, whom any passerby on the street can see is evil incarnate, because their fathers drew up a contract when they were children.  Even though Emily is repulsed by Nicholas, she thinks all will be well when they marry.  Even after she finds out about all his evil deeds, she STILL is set to marry him!  It went on for so long before she even began to see the light that I lost interest.		Will was a good man, but his likability couldn't save the book.  The ending just seemed cheesy and abrupt.
1,ERRORS SO HIGH
1,This book needs some improvement in several areas. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't all that great either.
1,No stars...just wanted to thank you for letting us know this was not a stand alone book....dont like series books so didn't read....
1,I do not usually give bad reviews, I will skim and delete the book so that I don't look up the author later.  However, I read Monica James' first series and liked it enough to read the "Something Like Normal" series. But, I skimmed a lot of this book because I really wanted to give it a chance, the first book is good and the series should have been over by the second book.  There is A LOT of immature drama that is not even realistic and this book ends very crappy leading into another book I imagine.  I escape into books to read good stories, with happy or sad endings, as long as the story is realistic. This one, however is a waste and I hate that, as I feel it could have been good.  A young girl with the past Mia has, no doubt would be traumatized but I seriously doubt she would be so drama filled. I'm sure she would not be jealous but would have shut down easily instead.  Also, Quinn's past story is not even sad, it just weird.  Also, withdrawing so much money would never happen so again poor story and I do not recommend it.
1,All her information about the Holocaust and war isn't real nor well done. Even if it's fiction I love for it too be based around truth. Especially when it talks of the Holocaust a time where 17 million life's ended for nothing. This book had good intentions, just think the author needs time too talk with real Holocaust survivors.	As for her grammar, it's perfect. And highly well written. Just wish the authors facts was correct.
1,ok Megan had every right not to tell that tool Adam about his kid. book totally passed me off. He told her he didn't want a family why should she risk her son's feelings by telling him. Some men don't deserve their kids. got so furious with Adam giving Megan carp didn't even finish the book... If you want to read about a stupid woman than this is the book for you.
1,This was nothing more than cheaply concocted porn, and nothing like what was portrayed in the pre-description. I assumed it would be sexy, but really!!!  Don't waste your time downloading this.  It's crap.
1,If you like erotic storylines you will enjoy this book. very few characters and it was a very fast read.
1,Beware!  Before you buy this book (or get it free) you should know that it is not a series of 6 books, each with a beginning and an end.  Instead it is one story stretched out over 6 volumes. There will be no ending until you finish book 6.  If you pay $2.99 for each one, this one story will cost you $18.00!  You decide if you want to do that.
1,I loved the story. It was full of adventure, sex, and love. I laughed and cried and could not put it down, but there were two sex encounters that my church would class as pornography. I wish you would consider writing books without those encounters written out.
1,Not a good story. Towards the end of the book was ridiculous. The lengths that people go through to cover up their wrongs is disgusting.
1,This book was ok, but it was listed as having over 700 pages.  If there were 150 I would be suprised.  The book also started as if you were supposed to know what is going on but it doesn't explain itself.  I don't like short books and will not purchase one with less than 200 pages.  Because that isn't a book it's a short story.
1,Sorry to the author,  this is not the style of writing that I enjoy! I can't exactly explain why. Did seem to drag on.
1,Bad not terrible...  Story doesn't add up though..
1,[SPOILERS]	This book started out as a stereotypical romance:  Strong but sensitive man meets aloof woman and slowly melts her cold exterior with his love.  The author gives the story pleasant science fiction flavor by making the woman in question an alien and giving the man an experimental neural implant.  So far so good. Unfortunately, halfway through the book, the author ruins it by suddenly revealing that the man is a guardian, an alien super being with god-like powers and a legion of planetary super-computer-cyborgs at his command.  The story immediately looses all sense of conflict or dramatic tension.  Literally every conflict the main characters face in the second half of the book is resolved within pages when a solution drops right into their laps.  For example: possible political opponents turn out to secretly share the lead characters viewpoint.  A growing love triangle is resolved when the other woman is murdered and her lover proceeds to conveniently forget she existed.  The threat of an overwhelming battle fleet is defeated by a secret superweapon that only the guardian knows about.		All in all it feels like the author wrote two different stories and attached the first half of one to the second half of the other.  The potential is started with fails to come to fruition, leaving the story disappointing and unfulfilling.
1,This book was a total waste of my time.  I definitely do not recommend this book to anyone.  This is seriously the worst book I have ever read.  I will be deleting this book from my kindle.  I would strongly suggest moving on to another book to read.	***SPOILERS***	Effie gets a job in NYC.  Her boss asks her join him in meeting a client.  Effie and Jack (the client)  start having a relationship after meeting.  She doesn't know if it's a good idea because he is her boss's client.  Effie' s old boyfriend turns up.  Attacks her at a coffee shop after Jack convinces her to meet up with him.  Jack later tells Effie that his first love got killed in a accident and he blames himself because she was drunk and he should of stopped her from driving.  Jack takes Effie to LA and while at a party they run into a guy who  works at the same place she doe only there in LA. That guy from the party tells Effie' s boss and he yells at her on Monday, calls her a whore and fires her on the spot.  Turns out Jack is making his own label company and offers Effie a job in accounting.  She accepts his offer after finding out that Sam her boss got fired and is being investigated.  After a concert Effie goes outside and Sam tries to rape her.  Jack finds her and beats up Sam.  Fast forward to test and Jack has encouraged Effie to pursue her a worrying career.  After Jack read one of her books he circulated it around producers, etc. and they want to turn it into a movie.  Jack meets Effie' s parents after almost getting raped.  Effie encourages Jack to reconnect with his parents after they found out his first love died (because they never liked her, they were happy she died, and he moved to LA and drank a lot and did drugs).  The end.
1,Unfortunately, the plot was the only good thing about this book.  The writing was immature and grade school.  An editor or a good friend with a working knowledge of grammar and spelling could have moved this to a 4.  Are all the 5 star reviews written by family and friends?
1,Couldn't get past the second chapter. Author provides nauseating detail about everything, slowing the story to a crawl. The first chapter contains talk about his ex wife and their sex issues and then pathetic descriptions of his new wife's body that he's always hungry for. Oh, and he just can't t live without her. Puh-LEEZE. Maybe appeals to young adults, but just too corny for anyone looking for a good mystery.
1,Just really didn't enjoy the main character's perspective.  Not my style.
1,This short story is an epilogue to Hardwired.		Most of the characters in Hardwired were alive, struggling, fighting hard for something.  Cowboy sought a way to be free; Sarah risked everything she had for tickets to the new world.  Pick any minor character, too -- Maurice, seeking to preserve shreds of the past; Warren, who refuses to let the last war be over; the streetboys who hunted Sarah, just trying to get by.  Daud, looking for an escape from his pain.  Jimi, the crazy over-the-top teenage daredevil.  Even Cathy, a sensation-seeker (when she can).  Even the Silver Apaches who are looking for not just death, but a stylish, ethical death.  And the roiling masses of everybody just struggling to survive.		Out of all these fervent characters, Solip:System focuses on Reno.  He has little backstory and little motivation.  Near the end of his first life, he spent most of his time watching his stock portfolio.		He doesn't get any more interesting in this story.  Neither do any of the other characters.  It's all muted, downbeat, airless.		From Hardwired:		"The ambulance driver wants payment in advance, and she opens her portfolio by comp and transfers the stock without questioning the prices he gives her.  Daud dies three times before the driver's two assistants can get him out of the apartment, and each time they bring him back the prices go up.  "You got the money, lady, and he'll be fine," the driver tells her.  He looks at her nakedness with appreciative eyes.  "All kinds of arrangements can be made," he says."		Hardwired delivers that over and over.  Solip:System does not.
1,DNF. Hate the author's writing style in book 1. I read and completed book 2 first, which had similar issues but was ok; the writing is choppy and  sentences or paragraphs end abruptly without continuing the thought or plot.
1,Silly book. Easy read.
1,If you like your Catholic spirituality at the junior-high self-righteous  butterflies-and-rainbows level, you'll LOVE Sister Justicia.		But if you're actually a Catholic who is intrigued by the potential in the dilemma of a realistic, faithful nun who has a good heart and a genuine conflict between doing what seems to be right and what actually IS right...go somewhere else. You won't get it here.		I had high hopes for this book. Catholics, probably more than any other faith tradition, have a long history of being able to laugh at ourselves. We have a long history of "personalities" and quirky, interesting people who find quirky, and sometimes offbeat, ways of serving God that end up doing amazing good. When I read the description of the book, I thought if anybody could carry off that delicate balance, Bell ought to be able to do it.		I was wrong.		Cataloguing what's wrong with this book would take almost as long as the novella is itself. There are weird timeline things going on here; on one hand, Sister J seems to have been a nun for a long time--but on the other hand, she's young enough and (apparently) new enough that people still recognize her in her old "persona." Several other things happen in periods of time that seem unreal, perhaps because of the constraints of the novella length. But by far, the worst gaffes--over and over--are those misrepresenting Catholicism in general and the consecrated life in particular.		Sister J indulges in violence needlessly, selfishly, and seemingly without much conscience involved-and then justifies it in her so-called "confession." She has no concept of obedience or submission to the nun who's supposedly her superior, even though she would have taken a vow of such at her profession. (She doesn't even call Sister Sarah "Mother," although the story leads us to believe that Sister Sarah is, in fact, her Mother Superior.) She chides Sister Sarah to "Read the Book!" (meaning the Bible), while disobeying that same book in regards to both immediate community authority and civil authority. She keeps invoking God's law as "higher" and that she's following it (in typical "spirit of Vatican II" self-absorbed fashion), but there's no prayerful discernment shown of that law and her part in it. (Does this woman ever pray, in fact? There's no Mass attendance in here, there's no community prayer with the other sisters...I guess she doesn't think that small detail is important.) She has this weird notion that she can get "black marks" against her name and get bounced out of the religious life for it, as if she's an eighth-grader in some Catholic reform school...when in reality, the difficulties people point out with her living the religious life should have (and would have) been dealt with LONG before she was in this spot (in formation, particularly). She wears a habit with "nun shoes" on one page, and then later on talks about the difficulty of running in "pumps"--as if "nun shoes" and high-heeled pumps are the same thing?		In other words...who did this author have as a technical consultant about the consecrated life? Sally Field?		This isn't a novel about a "rogue nun." This is a novel about Hollywood and the media's version of what a nun is, overlaid with a bunch of self-righteous "spirituality" and "justice" that is cringeworthy at best and insulting at worst. It gets one star because the writing, in the sense of pure craft, is great. The details, however, are a mess. If an author can't even be bothered to capitalize such things as "Magisterium" and "Church" (both of which would be capitalized in Catholic reference), his ignorance about his subject matter is embarrassingly clear. And no one bothered to correct it, either. If you can't get those basic things right, your premise will end up full of holes, and this one does.		Don't waste your money. $1.49's too much for this pap.
1,Pretty dull. The characters are one-sided except for the main boy. It is really a chronicle about a boy and girl living on the prairie, farmers and how society views them, especially the boy, who was raised by an Indian woman and came from low parentage. Yet the boy is the strongest of the characters, likable, smart, funny with common wit. He goes farther than most of his ilk would, yet comes home for the simple life, eschewing the big city and its illicit lures. The writing is very simple, a bit dull, in spite of some simple views about city life vs. living in small towns and rural farms. The girl never quite changes, always selfish, stubborn and always hoping for more than she has. While being hopeful is good, she never tries to do better for herself, but takes on odd challenges to be more boy-like so she and her boy pal can be friends.
1,This book was confusing and no proper story line to follow. i felt robbed even though it was for free
1,This is ridiculous. The story is full of holes and childish behavior. Jennifer is living in NYC with a MBA searching for job so she can continue to live in NYC. She goes to an interview and begins to bash/antagonize the lady doing the interview. Of course on her way out of the building she rides the elevator with the owner of the company and pours her heart out (yack - any self respecting business man would find her behavior immature and catty for her to be bashing the interviewer). I'm quickly becoming frustrated with this immature behavior from someone supposedly so educated.		Giving the book a second chance, I continue to read thinking all these great reviews can't be utter BS. On her walk home, she ultimately trashes her feet so bad that she has oozing bloody sores that require bandaging and antibiotic ointment. How did she even make it home in a pair of shoes that destroyed her feet so badly? I'm shaking my head at a reality factor here. All these months she's lived in NYC, knowing that she'd be walking a lot, and she does something this stupid? Over dramatized.		Ok, at this point I'm asking myself do I want to read any more, and I convince myself to continue forward. It is after all a book, and I love to read. Third and final chance comes and goes quickly. The next morning, Jennifer receives a call from the lady that interviewed her and is offered an unbelievable job. Jennifer is broke and struggling to remain in the city because her family is horrible and she can't go home a failure. Guess what Jennifer says to the fabulous/incredible job offer? She argues with the lady rehashing her hurt feelings of the previous day, intentionally trying to piss her off. Wow, unbelievable. I'm done with the story. No need to read any further because this Jennifer is too stupid to live.		But what do I do? I still give it one more chance. Just shoot me now, because I'm a glutton for punishment. That following day, Jennifer who is struggling to make ends meet, who can't even afford a $200 window air conditioning unit, goes on a spending spree with her roommate to have their hair and nails done and to buy clothes. She doesn't just get a good business outfit, she buys Prada, spending thousands of dollars for 1 outfit. Here is a girl who is $40K in debt for college, barely has enough money for rent, can't afford a taxi, and she's buying Prada? There is NO WAY this female had a MBA! This character is utterly stupid. I'm done and I only made it to Chapter 8.
1,I liked the concept of the story, but it really needed to be edited. Dialogue was dragged on too much, not to mention a lot of it was pretty immature. The price of the book is more than what it's worth.
1,Kindle Unlimited, so thankfully will never have to see again. Unbelievable even for a 'fairy tale' type story, not for children because not childlike just childish, in horrible bullying basically okay, guy gets rich and whole town profits, storyline doesn't have to make sense even in the limited framework it had for this type of story, being tech savvy grandkids and myself both found the links pretty much useless with either option, does NOT make book 'interactive' either, look term up in dictionary, and all found the 'writing' to be huge waste of time. As any tech would say GIGO {garbage in garbage out}. Granddaughter's thoughts were ''Huh?" and my grandson's was "Yuck!" Mine not printable under amazon TOS.

1,Too onesided and opineated
1,I really think this is a quality product and I would buy it again. Really good!! Loved IT! So happy I got this!
1,I'm giving this a low review not because it only has 3 recipes, that it clearly states, but because I would never actually make these recipes, let alone eat them.  These recipes include "Cheeseburger Mac Attack" the very idea is gross to me.  It looks like a Hamburger Helper recipe.  "Rockin Red Velvet Pancakes" pancakes are made of hot cocoa mix and cocoa powder and chocolate chips, etc.  I can see where the 300 calories will be on this one.  "Buffalo Chicken Wing Mac n Cheese" another nasty title that has my stomach churning.  I don't like Hot Sauce so thats one reason this is turning me off.  I gotta say I was disappointed, if this is what all the Hungry Girl recipes are like, I don't understand how she gets such high reviews.
1,i did not enjoy this book at all.  the characters were not very appealing.  depressing story line & bad endinf.
1,The three first books were good stories but the last one kill the series.  Why?  Well the writer emphasized too much vulgarity every time the four words in each page, I count four or five times a page also to emphasis in graphics scenes between the relationship among the main characters.  This is not my kind of book.  For graphic and dirty talk I do need read a book I just walk in the streets and listen or see a phono movie in cable.  I do get the writers think that foul words do a great book.  I hope that Mrs Eden get the message she has talent, good imagination and there things that is unnecessary to made a good story. I recommend this series to anybody who likes graphic books and foul language.
1,I didn't even finish the book. If I wanted a M/M romance I would have bought one.  This book should have been placed in another category at least. The reason I read these books is because of the love story between a man and a woman. Also, I'm sick and tired of people comparing being black to being gay. Both imply a negative connotation. You might was well say it's the same as being white too since white is right but someone may take offense to that. Yes we are ALL grown but I take great offense when people compare the two. It's NOT the same but I digress.
1,The concept was good. It was fairly decent until they vanished then it's like the author ran out of conflict and had to make something up on the fly. This continued all the way up to the battle scene which was the most well piece in the entire book.
1,Slow action.  Takes forever to play a game. Many times I had to touch a letter or space several times befor it took.  Spaces on the left border are nearly impossible to play.
1,Very poor book. Deleted after a couple of  pages. Eleven words after my concise review to make Amazon very happy.
1,I guess I felt this had to be a great book. After all, Oprah touted it along with thousands of others. The first half was fine but then things really bogged down. The characters lacked any depth and the story kept jumping from Sarah to Handful without actually developing. I actually skimmed the second half and honestly thought about throwing in the towel 2/3 of the way through. I found very little endearing about any of the characters. It's not like we all haven't spent much of our lives reading and studying the struggles of  the slaves and women. Nothing new here.
1,Could have been a good MC romance if it hadn't been for every woman that is a main character being brutally abused in one way or another.
1,great story but it ends with a cliff hanger. You don't know who killed Jax and from reviews you won't find out in book 2 either. I enjoyed the character development but the end was anticlimactic.
1,I liked this book fairly well until the end. It felt incomplete and unfinished. Maybe the author couldn't decide how it should have ended so that last chapter was it. Bummer.
1,I've always been fascinated by the topic of body language and was looking forward to reading this guide.		The information is ok but nothing here that I didn't already know or that is readily available for free online.		As some other reviewers have mentioned, it would have been nice to see more specific examples of body language: gestures etc, presented in point form that might have been new to readers like myself.		Deleted from my kindle already.
1,You can't review without stars otherwise I would not have given it even one star. Previously I have chosen Alexa Riley's books and loved them. The fact is this was sort of forced on me because I wanted to read Halloween Treats which was a 5 star read.	I don't care for raw, disgusting submission. I have read some of her Alpha Dom submission books and they were okay if you are into that type of read. I would not have purchased the other 3 books included with Halloween Treats  or as in this case read them for free. Actually let me clarify that statement I read the first few pages and the last few hoping things would improve but they didn't. In fact I was more disgusted to find they really know each other and this is what they do to get their rocks off. Unfortunately things do go wrong in submissive and dangerous acts like this. Having been called by the emergency room many times in my career to advise of death or serious life threatening injuries these acts cause. I still can't figure how people do this in real life or better yet enjoy reading about it. But I guess everyone has their own taste(lessness).
1,If I could give this book 0 stars I would. There's no way that someone could be as stupid as Stephanie. I guess being as dumb as she was everything that happened to her was deserved. The author could've made the storyline a bit more believable. After being raped several times, she allowed the same guy back into her life then turned around and married him...ugh... Come on now... Better luck next time..
1,Complete & absolute rip-off. Do not waste your money. This book seems like it was added so the author could make some more money. Not so we could enjoy a well written, interesting, escape into the story kind of book. I can't begin to tell you how cheated I feel
1,There were a lot of grammatical errors...and the timelines were really confusing. How did Jackie and Coffee travel to see Cream 5 hours after they learned she was burned on her hand before having dinner (and not to mention Jack and Coffee traveled by car, not plane) and still made it to Cream as she sat to eat with the fam? Yes, she went to the ER but thats far fetched. And if Coffee shot Robin between the eyes, how was she still in the book?
1,You want us to hate Lalya in the first book and love Cole.  Then you want us to hate Cole and love Lalya?  Couldn't you have made someone else the bad guy.
1,Absolutely no suspense to this book.  All characters are boring and very single sided.  The language used seemed to be geared more to 4 or 5th graders.
1,No ending--need to buy more to find out what happens.
1,Seems logical key a been there done that kind of story, not really much of a point. A money grab?
1,this book was just OK for me. I really did not like the story line but kept reading hoping it would get better - it did not.
1,What is this??? Usually I like Afton Locke but this book has no true buildup its just a big ball of frustration!! Justin is a Rastafarian (a religion)And he calls Kyra  Babylon because she's his temptation and he spends time in the book trying not to give into her. Then he's supposedly dying from something that is curable but because of this religion he doesn't wanna be treated. At 16% in the book they are already in love and I mean it's so confusing a waste of my money.
1,Nice to have a group of stories.  Honestly, they weren't very good. Sorry.
1,Horrible book. Must've been written by a second grader.
1,Loved the  idea of the book but what a snooze fest, didn't really care  for the way it was written either.
1,All I can say is if you like sex sex sex and no real story, or character development than this is the book for you.	And to all you other critics, really pages and pages to say your point?
1,All I can say is this was just sad. Cole was a coward. Faith was bitter.  Their marriage had become a routine.  Kelly and Rasheeda, desperate and pathetic.
1,This should be a children's book, edited properly for certain content. It is an over-the-top do-gooder story about a teen girl who dresses like a boy to gain passage on a ship from Ireland, her homeland, to America. The story was based on a realnperson, but the embellishment is just too much. The girl becomes a crusader for civil rights at a time in history that wasn't possible, late 1800's.  Sure, we all wish our ancestors spoke out and treated others of different cultures, race and religion with dignity and understanding, but thus was way too much. Secondly, the supposed quaint Irish sayings began to wear on me....it got almost silly by the first third if the book!  It was almost irritating....and my grandfather was Irish! Outside of a few things that maybe a little over a young book reader's understanding, this book would be a great adventure for anyone under age 12 to read. As an adult reader, I wasn't impressed and wouldn't be able to recommend to another adult.
1,I preface this by saying I couldn't even finish this novel. I felt that the plot was all over the place. I rarely give bad reviews. I hate to leave them. I want to let you decide for yourself though. Give it a shot maybe I was having a bad day....
1,Predictable plot, no character development, unbelievable scenarios and time frames, plus grammatical errors that a high school freshman would not make, equals something not wasting your time reading.  Ugh.  Just awful.
1,Everything happens too quickly.  Also there's nothing given anywhere that she is into BDSM and that would have definitely shown up in her previous dates.  She should've just accepted him as her sissy girlfriend.  Since it's first person narration we should have been told something about her past that indicated her BDSM orientation.  No wonder her old boyfriend thinks she's insane.
1,I've had Winterspell on my TBR for a while and when I realized there was a prequel novella, I knew I had to read it first. . . And I wish I hadn't. The characters were blah and I found that I didn't care about the story or what was happening.		This may be a me-thing because I have trouble getting into novellas. There's not enough story for me or character development for me to care what happens to these characters. Maybe if I had read Winterspell first I would have enjoyed Summerfall, but that's not the case.		I religiously read the first few chapters, but ended up skimming the second half. Why didn't I just give up and DNF it? Because I still want to read Winterspell and maybe something I read during Summerfall will have a bit of significance. Also, I'm not in the habit of judging a book / author / series by one short 130 page novella. So I'm going to give myself a few days between Summerfall and Winterspell and dive back into Claire's storytelling.
1,Again, didn't like any of the charactersat all. I won't bother reading the rest of the sunset series, end of the line for me.
1,The sex scenes in this story are pretty darn scorching I am not going to lie. Where my disappointment lies is with the whole mystery part. The whole story Elizabeth is afraid of her past coming back, afraid of getting close to Marco, afraid of the mysterious Santino finding out about Marco. When we find out why I was so let down, I mean seriously thats it? I spent the entire book waiting for the climax, something awesome, some super huge revelation, and that, was it? Yeah, it was let down, to say the least. 		I am giving stranger 2 stars, but keep in mind the sex scenes and the chemistry in the book is pretty awesome.
1,Had hope for this one. Interesting enough but cannot get past the unbelievable situations and referring to a woman's biological parts as "down there" and then to italicize it and draw more attention to it was terrifically distracting.		UNimpressed.
1,So boring I could not finish reading it.  Gosh I could have written better!  Hate to be so harsh but that's it.
1,i didn't carefor this book
1,Horrible book. Just awful. It sounded good but it has no redeeming qualities. I was so very disappointed. The characters were hateful and I really wish I had never "met" them. The story was bad and just got worse. The ending was terrible. Haven't been this disappointed in a book in a long time. Why would anyone waste their time writing a book that just makes the world a darker, nastier place? It wasn't scary. It wasn't interesting. It wasn't mysterious. It was just plain awful.
1,I was so hoping to bake these cakes after the good reviews, but was very disappointed to see that each recipe only says gluten free flour, not what makes up that flour.  It would have been helpful to have been given an idea of what was in your gluten free flour, I know that I can't use rice flour or any others on their own, having had terrible flops from trying before, so what is your flour made up from.  Your book is missing a major ingredient!
1,Nothing new in this cook book. Same old chicken recipes with a few spices thrown in. Disappointing. I would not recommend.
1,1.0 out of 5 stars too many typos	I was disappointed by the number of typos in the story...it tended to make it confusing. The story was predictable and yet missed "meat". The characters kept being switched around with the wrong names. :(	A rip-off! 3 chapters for .99 cents!
1,This book lost me in chapter 2.	1.  It reads like the characters are in 3rd grade, maybe due to translation from some other language to English???	2.  Spies cannot be this dumb! They would ALL be dead!	I gave up after her increasing stupidity got on my last nerve.
1,I did not finish the book.	Seventh mark part 1 starts off okay. Didn't run me off immediately, didn't fully grab my attention. So I plowed forward in the hopes that greatness was just around the corner. It wasn't. The first bad sign was at the high school when she first meets Grace. Grace comes up to Rouge, asks if she is new, then grabs her and tugs Rouge to her car. Having never met each other before that moment, with no real introductions, and after admitting she wasn't good with people, Rouge simply accepts this odd treatment and hops into Grace's car without a word of protest or unsureness. Bad sign number two: Rouge's foster father tries to flirt with Grace (a high school girl!) the moment she steps into the house and then both girls giggle about it. Bad sign number 3: Michael, Grace's brother, and Rouge have a insta attraction (usually I can tolerate that but something happens later that completely sours me on the whole book) Bad sign number 4: Grace and Rouge go to a party and once they get there Grace tells Rouge that Michael likes her. That's all well and good until Grace tells Rouge that she will point out all the cute guys and says "might as well make Michael jealous". This girl wants to make her own brother jealous over a girl neither of them know? Finally, bad sign number 5: After she was nearly attacked by a strange beast at the party Rouge spends the night at Grace and Michael's house. That by itself is weird as they have known each other for two days at the most. If I had nearly been attacked, I would have gone home to recoup not a stranger's house. To make it worse Michael puts her to bed. Who in the world lets a strange boy practically tuck you in?! "He gently helped me lie back down." I mean come on! And to top it all off when Rouge wakes up Michael is in bed with her. She wakes up and he IS IN BED WITH HER! And then he asks her to go for a drive with him just him, no Grace. And she agrees! She was almost attacked, slept in a stranger's house, is apparently okay with waking up with a guy in her bed, and then goes for a drive with him! It was unbelievable and I was shaking my head the entire time I was reading. I stopped reading after the whole bed scene.	Now if you find all the above unworthy reasons to stop reading a book, then by all means read away. I, however, will not be recommending this book. I wish the author the best but this was not my cup of tea. 1 out of 5 stars.
1,Awful.
1,The story did not attract me, it was boring. I couldn't wait to finish reading this book. If asked what the story was about, I couldn't tell you, my mind was not in it.
1,Writing and characters uninspiring. tried to accomplish too much for such a short format. could have been expanded to something better. it has potential but not in this format.
1,This was the most boring book I think I have ever read. Although that may be the point. War is not exciting and music playing like the movies. Still was too many mundane everyday details.
1,Managed to finish but really hated all the characters.  This is exploitation at its worst
1,Couldn't read any more....
1,This story is probably no more then 10 real pages, if that. On the kindle it actually ends at 80% and the last 20% is a preview chapter of the authors next book. In Kindle language it is 254 "locations" and it ends on location 203.		People describe this book as if there is a beginning middle and end, and it starts with a car breaking down and people making their way to a farmhouse and all this stuff happening, when we are dropped into the story somewhere after they've already arrived at the house. Its like we missed out on some action in the beginning, and while sometimes that's fun and interesting it just felt completely wrong.		In fact, we don't get to know any of the characters, heck I couldn't even remember the characters names or who was married to who. They describe already being in the house when the story starts and that its so dark nobody can see anything, and then all of the sudden they hear sounds outside which apparently they must have heard before the book started, but then all of the sudden people feel drugged and their minds are being screwed with, and then somehow there are vampires and bright lights...		This was ALL over the place. I felt like I was reading some 14yr olds very poor school assignment. I had NO idea what I was even reading...what was the point of "what rule was broken?" I was thinking that it was supposed to be like a horror movie reference cause people are always saying there are rules to survive a horror movie, but in the end I still don't even know....		On the bright side, it was only a 5-10 minute read and it was free. Quite frankly I'm surprised at all the good reviews here...
1,predictable
1,this book and nothing going for it. didn't like the way it was written or whatever the point was supposed to be
1,As I said when I was reviewing the Oklahoma mail order husband series, this is not a complete story! The author has taken one story and split it into 3 parts so she can sell it. And she leaves so much out as far as continuity, did they just leave his horse out on the range to rot? If they were truly killing only what they need to eat, they would have butchered that too. And the story ends her father is still sitting out in the yard, and she says to just leave him, what's to keep him from repeating the same behavior, he still has his shotgun.	Just a waste of good reading time, thank god it was free. If she thinks it will make us want the other 2 books, she's wrong! I fell for that with the other series
1,obviously, I wasn't paying enough attention to the cover of this book when I got it, it is a clear advertisement that sex figures highly in this book.  I don't read romance books for sex, so once it became apparent quite early on in this book that both lead characters would be lusting after each other the moment they met, I stopped reading.		my user name says it all......I don't read books for sex content.  so many authors, including this one, seem to feel that they need sex to sell their story.  with me, it loses me as a reader.
1,Oh come on!! What is going on here?  How on earth did this get to make the list at Kindle?  Pretty pathetic.  Please, do not wast your time.  Poorly written, stupid attempt at a plot.
1,This on was just OK. Everything happened so fast, and they just worked out fine in the end. This would have been a story for a longer book with more feelings and adjustments to be made between the main parties.
1,I don't know what I was expecting but definitely not this. I never read a paranormal book before so I took a chance and started with this one. While the story isn't terrible I was looking for more character and plot development. I am going to try book two just to see if there is more to the story. As of right now I am seeing this as a teaser.
1,Good story line, but written in such a way as to be unengaging.
1,Since when do you have to be stupid to fall in love. Sigh, the main character goes on three dates with a guy the ck
1,Finish the book already, I'm done buying this in pieces. I'm not sure if you feel this a good way or greed. Anyhow I'm not investing anymore money. The story has a great plot and story line. But I'm want to read a book from beginning to end.  I'm sure you have some followers, but you lost one.
1,I was on the fence about Book One in this series (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Bitten-Bitten-Series/dp/B005J5CZBS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Bitten (Bitten Series)</a>) but was interested when I ran across Book Two for free.  It took several sittings to finish as I found it too easy to put it down.  This book failed to live up to the flashes of promise shown in the first one.		The story picks up right where it left off, Ally has been kidnapped by Moira and thrown into a dungeon along with her two besties (Trish and Pam) to prevent her from marrying Ben.  The dialogue between the girls was stilted and I never understood why these three girls were best friends.  I found very few flashes where Ally's character became as vibrant as in the brief teaser called Book One. We are also introduced to Gabe, the friend Ben was talking to when Moira took Ally, and I liked the subplot of his family's feud with the Verdons (Moira's family).  Ben spends a lot of time worrying about Ally's pending transformation into a vampire (it could go very bad and she might crave human flesh) but although a lot of time was spent voicing his thoughts, more first person action would have been preferred.		My issues with the heroine/hero romance and serious need for proof reading makes this book hard to recommend.  Why would Ally who has never fallen in love before, fall in love with someone who constantly waffled and was such a bad judge of character?  Ben did not want to have a traditional vampire marriage and was willing to postpone his arranged one to Moria 4 times and yet constantly said that if he hadn't found his true love, he would be okay with spending eternity with Moira. Huh?  Also, Ally spent only a few hours with Ben before falling deeply in love and was willing to give up everything. Maybe 10 pages were spent together and the rest of the time was spent trying to find each again.  I just couldn't feel it for these two.
1,Here we go, what's with the rapey undertones a lot of romance novels have been getting lately? It was a jumbled mess of rapey undertones and bad writing, the perfect storm of do not buy.
1,Horribly dirty
1,Really an unbelievable storyline that was not very much fun to read. Annoying how they only talked about why they got married with only a paragraph about why they didn't want to be married. Not worth rereading for sure.
1,its was an ok read until i realized the gay element in there.	should there be homosexuality in our books too?	Its taken over our screens now in romance novels too.	i didn't buy any other book after this from the writer.
1,As it begun, I thought it would be good. It is a good idea to explain why we should be kind to each other but I lost interest about halfway through it. Then I only read the inspirational quotes.
1,More like confusing instead of full of twists. I think it starts off as a documentary about the devil then jumps to a NA father son hunting party and before you know chapter is over and a widow and her dog come across a zombie/werewolf. Without a breather (next chapter), while putting to shame his grandparents and their southern sayings they come across werewolf footprints.... then ghosts.... gypsy diner.. I think it has multiple short storied that a slightly connected but never finish.		That was it for me, I hate cliffhangers. DELETE
1,Waste of my time. Hero was just plain dumb. He takes bad advice and has no clue how much he keeps hurting heroine. Don't care if he was trying to play it safe and follow bad advice, his methods of expressing himself to the heroine was very clueless and bad on his part. Example is in one scene heroine lays it all out and tells him what she wants. He just stays quiet and doesn't follow her when she runs from him humiliated. Then is surprised when friend shows up upset because he didn't feel he did nothing wrong and was just following his friendsfriend's advice. Worst his suspicioness on heroine was rediculose and his apologies after every thing was not enough for me to have forgiven him. Don't care if heroine did.		I didn't bother finishfinishing it but I am sure it got HEA. Just did not like hero or storyline.
1,Couldn't  relate with the characters. The whole dialogue was a lot of telling and philosophical musing. Totally unrealistic. I mean the story started in high school then moved into 5 to 7 years later. It took that long for the HE A. Not believable either where Clare/Hawthorne just stayed waiting in one place while Max/Heathcliff finds himself traveling while having relationship with another woman. I mean she was okay with that.  Unrealistic  really and pathetic. The writing style felt too literary and not much of angst. Even the sex scene was boring. Don't waste your time and money.
1,This was a well-written book.  It's not on a favorites list, but it's an interesting read.	Some aspects were interesting but at the price the rest of the books in the series are, I'm not gonna continue reading
1,Reviewers indicated it was hard to put down, with a lot of twists and turns. I found it very easy to put down and did so very early--and the only twists and turns I found were whether it was going to be interesting or not!
1,i tried ~ i just could not get into this book ~
1,This is the story of Conner and Faelan.  Conner gives his girlfriend of six months a promise ring and Faelan starts itching and her skin turns silvery after she's been wearing it. It also gives her some other feeling of need, which I won't go into in my review.  I won't spoil the whole story by telling any more.		This really did read like the opening to what could have been a novel had it been developed a little better.  There is one explicit scene between Conner and Faelan that just seems much too frantic & needy. The story just ends all of a sudden.  I would have given this 2.5 stars because it has a lot of potential.		At the time I downloaded this to my kindle it was being offered free in the kindle book store, which in no way affected my review of this short story.
1,Unfortunately the 'good bits' weren't good enough to make it fun.  It also suffers from rapidly changing thought processes, disjointed transitions and random additions.  Attempts at describing local flavor came off as superficial and flat.  Anatomical activities don't actually seem all that likely.		Seriously, if you want to read about a guy and two gals...well, isn't it great if it's a middle aged guy who is in great shape due to being a several year vegetarian, who is still thrilled with his wife of 23 years  because she so rapidly lost her baby weight and her b*****s are still big and gorgeous?  So, lucky that his wife's old friend from work (WAY too much expository thinking to himself to get these facts across) who, by the way, only has smaller b*****s, remembers the randomly thrown in fact the couple are nudists.  The friend who takes them to a nude beach, reveals that certain piercings make the aforementioned body parts much hotter, whose wife thinks it's great her husband finds her friend 'interesting' (and thank goodness the wife's friend has lost that extra bit of tummy she used to carry around), and well gosh, it's really great the wife seems to think the piercings are hot too wink wink?		Please, next time just leave out the fluff and the overdone internal musings that only serve to give an excuse to have the characters indulge in sex.  Give it a paragraph, then write the sex.  That is the point of this type of story so don't waste time on a not-so-compelling backstory and cut to the chase.  And try to  make it at least moderately interesting sex.  Better yet, make an interesting story WITH the interesting sex.		Sigh.		JTG		(edited to add two missing words...can't type apparently)
1,Written well enough. But do believe he had Stockholm Syndrome. Many of his friends and fellow army men were brutally murdered by the Japanese and he ends up saying he loves the Japanese. And there is no followup evidence that he testified against the brutal captors or tried to report them, etc.
1,I'm sure there are others who would enjoy this selection of novellas but they were not for me. Except the one with the dead guy I can't even remember the stories.
1,Annoying, Immature, Melodramatic, half-baked characters with an insulting premise for a plot device masquerading as the Big Secret. Colossal waste
1,45 chapters. I chose this book partially due to the reviews. I admit, there were some funny moments. By chapter 20, I was tired. I was sick to death of Becky bemoaning the fact that Matt was her boss and she was not going to get involved although she wanted to be involved with him.		I almost gave up. I am ashamed to admit that I did something that I have seldom, if ever, done before. I read the last chapter. I completely lost patience with the whole situation. Then I went back and tried to read the other 24 chapters. It was still a difficult read for me.		When it came to Becky's response to Charlie's offer of coffee, I was irritated with Becky. This shows how attached she was to her feelings for Matt?  Then, by the time I got to the conference, I thought, maybe this book will move along. By the time we got to her sister meeting her at the airport, I was done.		After that, it just became an attitude of let me get this over with before I lose my mind. I very seldom abandon a book, and I was not going to let this one get the best of me. Especially knowing how it ended.		I would recommend this book. Just because it wasn't really to my liking, does not mean that other people would not really enjoy it, as we can see from the reviews. Maybe I was not in the right frame of mind to read it.
1,Pace was a little too fast for me.  Not enough plot in the first story to make me want to read more.
1,This is the third time I've tried a Jordan Silver book and I was disappointed yet again...but I've learned my lesson. The books are almost completely from the male perspective and are ridiculous. The synopsis sounded interesting and from the excerpt I thought this would be a dual POV but I was wrong. Though we got some of the h POV, again this was all from the H view. I wouldn't mind that if the story had some sort of weight to it but it fell completely flat. Won't be purchasing anything else from this author
1,I can't say that I liked this book. It was not hard to read but the characters seemed a little wooden. When informed that she was not an android; Aneka just seems to take it in stride. The challenges to the main characters were not enough to make me want to root for them. As for the sex scenes, they seemed out of place and inappropriate for this kind of novel. All in all, I'd say that there are better books out there with the same type of theme.
1,The ending was the best part. Instead of three tiny slow installments it should have been one book. I've read better books from this author.
1,This book had my interest with that synopsis and with the success of recent serials, I was on board the Chase train.	Sadly I soon as I started reading, I wanted to throw myself off said train.		I can stand the whole cocky, man-whore character because they usually have some redeeming quality, and are somewhat charming. Though I just couldn't find anything I really liked about Dean Chase.	Everything about his behavior and demeanor had me cringing with disgust and rolling my eyes. Seeing as he is a lawyer at a well-repsected law firm, youd think hed know how to behave himself in public. Yet, he didn't seem to mind who saw him sticking his fingers up a girls vagina in the middle of a crowded bar.	Im all for the dirty-talking, alpha-male, but when Dean dished out lines he just sounded like a sexist, pig that needed to get well slapped.		As for the leading lady, I liked her. Until about the point they had an actual interaction with words And she didn't slap him across his face! I don't care how hot a guy is, I will not let any stranger spout that crap to me. The fact that she did, made me instantly dislike and lose all respect for her.		There's an abundance of reviews that praise this book and series, so Im simply one of the few that just couldn't get passed Deans way of being.
1,Slow read.
1,This book just couldn't hold my interest, I struggle through the first half and just could do it anymore. It has a lot of good reviews so don't let my one be you deciding factor
1,Huntley and Grayson both have heartbreak and tragedy in their pasts. When they meet at college, it seems like they are exactly what they both need to be whole again.		Despite a really stupid title which, no matter how you say it, sounds like a typo, this book began with some promise. But multiple REAL typos later (missing paragraph breaks, misspelled or missing words) and the repetitive plot made me sorry I'd started this book.		You wouldn't think violence and sex scenes would be boring but somehow the author manages it here. Certain subjects (rape, abusive relationships, cheating) were beaten to death (no pun intended). Others (mother's violent death, sister's rape) were just throw away lines that surprised me, but only because they seemed so out of left field. Like the author was told she needed to up the ante on the tragedy so she just threw these in for good measure.		Then there's the main characters' insta-love and incessant searing looks and blushing--and CRYING!! OMG these people cried more than anyone in the history of crying. By the end of the book, I was so sick of hearing how much these two people (tearfully) loved each other, I wanted to throw up.		Sadly, except for the ridiculously bad editing, this seems to be a well-practiced style of writing for this author, rather than a freshman attempt.	I won't be reading anything else by her.		P.S. SPOILER******	Really? They name the kid after themselves??? (Almost exactly the same names) SO MANY DEAD RELATIVES and they name the kid after themselves. Uh huh. Most narcissistic parents ever. True to form.
1,I tried. I really honestly tried to like this book. There was just too much confusion with it. From the wrong words being used like "too" instead of "to", to the wrong words being used to describe stuff, like the wind being like "strong soup", to the liquid dripping down her leg, or her squirting during the love scene, there were just too many issues. Then there was the voices in her head. They got way too confusing for me. It was like she had multiple personalities or something.		I hate giving horrible reviews, especially since I know authors put a lot of time and work into their stories, but sometimes no matter how much work they put in, it just isn't enough. There is no way I can continue reading this series unless the author goes back and edits her work. Hopefully the author will take this as constructive criticism and will work a little harder. I think she has a good plot idea it just wasn't executed properly. If she puts more effort into her work she could end up with some decent books. Until then I'm done with this author and I don't recommend anyone reading this unless she totally redoes it. That's just my opinion.
1,I tried to enjoy this book so much but it never happen. From beginning to end was repetition, I had to skim though most if the book.
1,Who are these people reviewing this book. It was pure garbage. Poor grammar , unbelievable plots, jumping around .I mean gosh this book was horrible .
1,I've read 4 of the books in this series and I think I've given up. Unfortunately all of the women are so MEAN at first none of them listen. They all start out just horrible it's not encouraging to want to read every book about women like that.
1,Straight and to the point, literally.
1,What did I miss?  I see that the majority of the other reviewers gave this 4 or 5 stars and after reading both books in this series, I really can't figure out why.  The writing is pretty juvenile, the characters are unlikeable and not developed and there are too many stories left unfinished.  Like I stated in my first review, my pet-peeve is when the actual story is shorter than stated.  This book is only 228 pages long and could have been included in the first book.  The remaining of the book is a free download of another book.  Great value, but if you're wanting to read more about Will and Lucy; forget it.	The concept of the story was interesting but there are too many things that I didn't care for to give a higher rating.  Read if you must, but don't expect too much with this story.
1,I am really struggling to finish this book  I cannot even begin to like the main character and the love interest is just too good to be true.  Most men would have kicked her to the curb.  Her boyfriend of 3 years breaks up with her in the beginning and she uses this as an excuse to be a snotty, sarcastic "B" to a really nice man who doesn't deserve her nasty mouth and why he gives her any kind of time is beyond me. Her friends are way nicer than I could ever be.  I am going to finish the book because I seldom quit on a book but I am skimming most of it because it is tiring.
1,2 stars was generous. It was non stop drama. The main character was ridiculous, I understand the need for revenge, but this girl was ignorant. Poorly written. I wanted to like it, I almost finished it, but even the author got bored of writing and just hurried the ending long. Not worth the time.
1,The main character, Mila, even though she is in her early twenties, acts as if she is fifteen. Not endearing at all, just annoying.
1,It was an okay read.  Fast and short, if that's what you're looking for.  I think it was as free book, so worth the time it took to read it.
1,I cannot see myself purchasing a part two that is only 50 pages long for 2.99 that is a waste she could have put everything in book 1.
1,My first J.E. novel was unpredictably crazy to say the least. But the strange events, coupled with Stephanie' s  affinity to bad luck, made this novel funny towards the end. The granny murders, Kevin the giraffe running loose throughout the Trenton, N.J. neighbourhood,  Uncle Sunny' s manhunt, and eventual weird departure, and Atwan's lackluster capture all contributed to a climatic end.  The plot was scattered and difficult to follow initially, the characters at time were too numerous, and Stephanie's  inability to commit to either Rangerman or Morelli, actually had me disliking her and her constant inane mishaps.	After reading this novel, I can safely say that I will not be joining a J.E. fanclub, anytime within the next century.
1,Nothing new
1,No depth to story or characters
1,ok for a short read with not too much mystery nor suspense to not be able to predict the way it will end by 1/2 way through. the 2nd book is no better. The character's were bland with no depth and I felt no desire to get to know more about them.
1,I love fantasy, but I never got into this. I guess I preferred hot, sexy billionaires to fantasy kids. Still, the cover was cool & the price is awesome.
1,This novel desperately needs an editor! The novel is full of misspellings, grammatical errors, and missing words. On top of that, the verb tense changes from past to present and back to past throughout the novel. The author tried to evoke sympathy for the character by telling about her abusive childhood, but that was so exaggerated that it was not even believable. The novel changed points of view without warning, and sometimes it was hard to tell who was speaking.
1,Nothing here you can not get from the post office website. And no info on ups or other competitors options.
1,Forget the spelling errors and annoying main character, this book is far too long for it's plot/subject matter. It drags on and on, is not well written and reminds you of that pesky friend you got rid of after college that was only focused on herself.		Skip this, even for free. Needs editing.
1,dumb
1,I've never read such awful books in my life. These were supposed to be teasers to get us to buy into each series. Not happening. The daughter of Aphrodite had to be the worst. The main character was so unbelievable. Whining about everything, and I mean everything. I can't stomach any more of these books. The main characters in all the plots were rediculous and that is a compliment. Please, don't waste your time and money.
1,I don't like writing bad reviews because I know that the author really put a lot of time and effort for writing a book. Usually I will give an A for effort but this one I am still giving an F. Here are the reasons why I gave this book 1 star, and I will give it ZERO star if that rating exist.		1. The writing is sophomoric. Gosh, this was the way a high school kid will write. This was the way I wrote when I was in 6th grade when I was dreaming of becoming the next Charlotte Bronte. Hence, for the book, I gave an F for effort because though I have not seen any previous work by the author, I can see from the writing style that it has not gone over the "writing a journal" level when we were assigned by our high school English teachers to write a diary so that we will improve our writing skills.		2. This book needed SERIOUS editing. "Short and concise" flew out the window on the first three pages. Readers do not need to know what Purity is doing every second, nor do they need to know that Purity has to "log on the Internet" to read email. And why does the author has to say Purity logged off. Is the book set in the 1990s? Everything points for it to be set in the 2000s.		I read the book in one hour. I began reading it waiting for my train and finished it right before my class started. I scanned so many pages because there really was nothing interesting in many of the pages that will add to the plot.		To the author, I would like to say that I really don't want to hurt your feelings but I have to say it with the hope that you will take this as a constructive criticism.		For my fellow readers, I wrote it so that you will not feel as cheated as I was. Yes it's a free download but I felt my time was wasted when I could have read a better book.
1,This is the 2nd book in this series  that has left me feeling bored and struggling to finish. Battle was the other.  Altho this seems to concentrate on the younger generation the main character, Oliva, seems to be a younger version of her Mom Joanne and not nearly as interesting. The character is flat and the story seems to be using sex as a page filler. I also found the editing very loose. Don't think I will be reading any more of this series. It seems to have run it's course.

1,This book came across as though the author used religious characters to make the explicit sex presentable.. The whole story just didn't ring true - even for romance which frequently mirrors fantasy. The use of swear words belong in the erotic side, they certainly don't seem to match up to the religious leanings of the main characters.
1,I was immediately drawn in by the blurb. Being from a military family, I was very excited to begin this series. Little did I know.....	 The writing style is juvenile. I despised the "heroine" the entire book. I have never left a book unfinished but this one was tempting.
1,Not what I was looking for
1,I just couldn't get into this book. I had to set it aside without finishing it, which I don't do very often.
1,good books
1,I'm afraid this story wasn't nearly as interesting and easy to read as Erin Lawless's first effort.  This one was very similar with the same varying points of view, something I really enjoyed and the same general "feel".  But this time the story was very slow to develop and there was way too much detail and rather lackluster dialogue.  The romance was okay but I still felt no sparks between H/h at 65% through the book!  The writing just wasn't very good. I will continue to try Lawless's books because I so enjoyed "The Best Thing I Never Had"  but this effort fell flat and I just cannot recommend it.
1,A sad commentary on man's inhumanity to his fellow man.....
1,The last book ended with a cliff hanger. I bought this book and it also ended in a cliff hanger. There are several more books, how much do I have to pay to get one story? Plus the heroine is immature and at times just plain stupid.
1,You only got to read a little over an hour and all you find out is that he is after his old girlfriend.  Book ended abruptly.
1,Started reading it but it did not draw me in so i just deleted it from my kindle.  Don't bother to even download it.
1,Ugh, this should be condensed into 5 solid minutes of stand-up, instead its just one of those long run on sentences you know the kind that never really end or come to a specific end they just wander and meander not quite finding the punch line or the point but with some editing or a comma or a deep breath they might just cause you not to roll into a coma or that could be a comma get it that was funny this was an attempt that maybe a better writer or some editors or hey maybe writers who can edit or you know some editors who have written there own stuff like this guy has at some point oh wait what was I talking about....not sure if the author knew or knows hey those words sort of sound alike I wonder whats in the refrigerator or on amazon....
1,This is one crazy book.  The story line and characters lacked any believable elements.  This is one book that is not worth reading or being recommend.
1,the writing is mediocre and simply a mess of words.  Do not waste your money, check out at the library if you must - there were 12 other books longlisted for the Booker prize and certainly the "Welsh Girl" and the wonderful "Gift of Rain" would have been far better choices.  What criteria was used in selecting?
1,They would actually not publish my first review because it was so negative.  I did not use a single swear word and I was specific about what I didn't like. I suspect the author complained about my review.  So, I am reiterating what the other one star reviews have said before me.  Now, if Amazon won't publish this review then I suspect they simply don't want you to know peoples' real thoughts on the books they read.		I didn't like this book. Use of the F* word. Was just too much for me! I thought this book vulgar, explicit and crude. Virtually no story. Just explicit sex described in vulgar, crude terminology. And, I am not easily offended.
1,Couldn't stomach how weak and annoying the main characters were. Read about the first half but it didn't get better so I permanently deleted it from my library.
1,This book has all the elements I enjoy: fantasy, dragons, magic and a plucky heroine. I just didn't feel it. Something about the writing came across as almost juvenile. I was exasperated a lot of the time.
1,I gave this one star, as the review process wouldn't let me give it zero.	The author has, at generous best, a perfunctory knowledge of this time period, the manners, the speech, the behaviors of the ton.  Furthermore, the motivations of the main characters are incredibly untrue to human nature.  The characters are poorly drawn, the dialogue unlikely.
1,Most of us like a good escape book now and then. No real brain work involved, just some fun. You killed me with spelling and grammatical errors.  There is no apostrophe in the word "nubbin".
1,sorry to disagree with so many others. but two unlikable leads and a possible archeaolgy thriller turned into a hokey sci fi fantasy novel is not my cup of tea
1,There was not a thread of story to be followed.  One dimensional characters no plot.  I am still trying to figure out what was happening.  Can not recommend this book.
1,Tansy is such an amazing heroine, with a fresh new lease on life. Ash is living the greatest high of his life, then his parents die and he free falls. This two characters are opposite, but need one another to live a normal life. Ms. Wolff has written this book in first person and that is a writing style that I don't enjoy. If you are a fan of first person writing, I do recommend this book for you. I give this book a score of 1 finger up and 7 toes.		NetGalley ARC given for my honest review.
1,So so dumb. They say sex sells but unfortunately not even that helped this book - but not for lack of trying!
1,Not up to the rest of the books
1,didn't realize it was about a threesome & didn't understand the attraction to the woman from the two men. She didn't have a great personality to attract BOTH men.
1,Georgia Lee Maxwell is unhappy with her lot in life, and at the newspaper she's at.  She gets the idea that it's better in Paris, so she moves there. Due to certain events, she stumbles over a body, and it's up to her to solve the case. That's all I want to say about the plot....but I do have a lot to say about the book.		This is a train wreck. I only read 10% on my kindle, and I had to bail on it....it's honestly that bad. Georgia Lee Maxwell is an unlikeable character. She whines and moans when she's at her job at the paper, moves to Paris....and still whines and moans about everything.  Alls she did was complain, when she was done doing that, she moaned. Then when she had her fill of complaining and mooing, she whined.  Man, she was annoying.		Lets move on to the plot, shall we?  Okay, get ready. Georgia is a newspaper reporter who doesn't like her job or the paper she's at. She moves to Paris, then contacts her friend, in her hometown, and wants to write for her publication....about the trends in Paris. Why would someone leave their hometown, and move to Paris, only to write for a hometown publication?? The idea is beyond goofy.  I mean, why would people care about fashions/trends in Paris?? Just goofy.		The writing is pretty bad. The author uses parenthesis when she writes....and that's so annoying to me. Usually when an author does that, there's just one or two words in the parenthesis, but this author has many sentences and entire paragraphs in the parenthesis. It was beyond annoying.		My fellow readers, I urge you not to read this book. The time you spend reading this book can be spent reading decent book. I'll put it this way, it was a free book, and I feel like I was ripped off.
1,Sorry I kept reading it. I kept thinking that there had to be more, unfortunately there wasn't.  Glossed over the last few chapters just to make sure.
1,It was very short, but, for some reason, very difficult to read. Everything seemed so unnatural and slow, even sex scenes were not very sexy. I didn't like it at all.
1,Firstly let me say the book had something going for a second and a second only and that second it was going was in the first installment which I got for free and maybe it being free made me not more critical of the story that followed but I digress; This is my review of the first two books in the series , The first book mAybe 100 pages or so was unique especially the way magic casting was being used but that idea didn't get far, another point was the weakness from the magic nothing groundbreaking or new concept but it was something to restrict the hero from being op yet that went down hill as well, I mean I understand he grew up playing rpgs and D&D but to many inconsistencies with his casting similar spells and either being weakened by them or able to battle hundreds of soldiers just  because his will and resolve was strong. The story was literally here and then over there multiple times, the only part of the story that was descriptive was the millions of inns and every detail of roasted duck being explained which is cool but when you don't even explain or describe the characters the hero comes in contact with its throws flags. Also how is it possible for him not to have a healing spell when he said a few times of role playing a warrior cleric?  So that was a downer but he can call on nature to lend him strength and drain individuals of magic which a non mAge brought to his attention after all the explanation of rarity of mages and the hate and dislike toss there way. So, i played for the second book just to see where this is going and I'm glad my bus ride is over and I'm at my destination because this was one draining experience and I'm 100% sure after reading the reviews and description of the next titles I can finish the series here and move on. I will not recommend nor tell anyone I have read this nor will I let this hold space in my kindle either. Peace
1,This is a book with no depth at all (I was going to say very little, but then decided, no, not even very little).  Apparently there are only two gay guys in town for the young man to have his first experience with since he doesn't want to go to college still a virgin.  The one guy is his brother's best friend and the other guy is a smarmy bully.  During the sex scenes, the young man did remind me of a puppy who was eager to please (which I don't enjoy -- just too unequal of a relationship emotionally to be a real relationship).  SPOILER ALERT:  all's well that ends well and the three are even going to room together at college (the two brothers and the best friend/lover of younger brother).  Of course, no mention is made of what will happen to all 3 relationships if the brother and his lover split up (which I see as being pretty darn probable once the younger brother matures a bit and finds out that there are more than 2 gay guys out in the big wide world)
1,I thought Paige's bear was obnoxious in the first book but he's a million times worse in this one. His protective nature goes beyond what I normally expect in an Alpha hero. It borders on controlling.
1,I guess I'm in the minority on my review on this book. I have really enjoyed all the rest of the books in this series but this one had so many characters in it that it was hard to keep up. Characters would just pop up and I was like, who is that and what do they have to do with this story? I did finish the whole book but I had some questions about some people in the book when I was done. There was a central theme but it seemed to have so much extra stuff in the story that it was hard to follow. Here's hoping that the next one will be much better.
1,I gave up around 1/4 of the way. The author is too self-serving. Easy to see why she has problems at home. Any of us who have children know how hard headed they can be. And yes many of us know about family betrayal. Parents as well as spouses. But her version of not much money is laughable. Her sense of reality is skewered by alcohol and a childish notion that the world owes her.  This woman needs to grow up.  Who doesn't want to run away at times? Abandoned children by narcissistic parents have on going problems their entire lives. Aside from physical abuse, nothing is more harmful than abandonment.  Sorry I had to even give it one star.
1,I'm a voracious reader of many fiction genres. Historical romance is a favorite of mine, and a touch of the paranormal in the heroine's prescience seemed like it would add to the fun. Sadly, I found the lengthy flashbacks and stutteringly interrupting flashes of insight so irritating that I abandoned the book just a quarter of the way through. I can appreciate the author's intent to build a rich background for the characters and plot, but the pace and style were less illuminating than ineffective.
1,I honestly don't think that tension over whether or not Grandpa will break his promise to his wife and grandchildren and kill a defenseless bird left in his care just because it annoys him is an appropriate plot for children.
1,I would skip this one.  Though it's very short, it's not worth the downloading, or the 10 minutes to read it.  The only good short horror story I've read on Kindle is "The Turtle Boy."
1,I purchased this book because I was curious from the sorta cliff hanger from the first book. I want to say that I was more interested in the other characters than Shade, but I wasn't. I was hoping that one of them, ANY of them would grab my interest, but it didn't. The love triangle was forced, the emotions were forced, and Shade became less and less likable by lacking any convictions, whining too much, and not believing in herself or her feelings. It nearly felt like the author was justifying the need for a love triangle when there really wasn't one. It's OK for a character in a book to not reciprocate another character's feelings and still have that be part of a story line. I mean, everything the book said "he'll be back, be patient" and then she's all "Who's to say what's going on with Dylan if I ever see him again so I might as well."	On top of that, the story continuity was disgraceful. It's very obvious that the author forgot that she had characters in a scene, or even in a point of interest. During a battle I kept wondering - what happened with Benton? Then he reappears back home with no explanation of how he got there or when. Names changed, not because they went by another name when they weren't under a curse, but because I don't think the author kept track of her story.	The idea that she has going here is what grabbed me as I adore Fae tales like these, but the poor writing, the lack of rereading work, not bothering to keep track of character's names, looks, or their goals in the story made for this sequel to be terrible. I'm curious as to how it ends because of the fae world is losing it's wards against the iron world, but I'm not going to read another one of these books. And I dislike Shade. A lot.
1,This is the 4th book I've read from this author and honestly I wouldn't even have read it if she didn't merge some detail of the next book within the previous book. (My brain bugs me because it wants to find out what happens with the next characters!) why is it each book has a main and very stupid emotion.... ANGER!!! Every one so far has had the characters angry for ridiculous reasons. I found myself over and over again asking myself why?!? On top of that, whoever edited her books need to be fired. There was no break in sections but all of a sudden the characters were in a different time... Really hate that I'm stuck ready this... Only plus side, it's free with kindle unlimited!!!
1,I tried to finish this book, not doing so well. There is a very nice plot, but the characters aren't well developed and there is information missing. This was alps written for basically a high school student attempting at higher romance. The details were lacking.
1,There is much about this romance to like. I like the BBW half wolf/half witch shifter a great deal. The hero is your typical man whore Alpha but he comes around and magically quits all bad behavior like they do.		I love the secondary cast of her BFFS. They actually have their own romances which are super fun. I do so wish they would get their own parallel in time romance so we could enjoy all the details. There is a nerdy savant human I adore and would be happy to buy her book.  I think the next book in the series focuses on this jerk Jax instead. Pout.		The subplot around artifacts and the panther nation and the dispapperace of a professor is good interesting. The college students are bit annoying and over the top but the panther nation concept in great.		Here is what went wrong and dragged it into two star territory kicking and screaming. I really wanted the book to live up to the bar of its good moments.		The heroine has several TSTL moments around the fated mated thing and the investigation.		For no reason what so ever in this small town, the hero takes his fated mated to a BDSM Club. Why? Why? It is such an off scene that it sours the book.		Ah. well. If she writes about Winifred (the nerdy friend) I will risk it and try again with this writer.
1,If I could put 0 I would. I was excited to read this series. From the ratings and the blurb sounded really good. The story line is good, but the writing is not. I don't care about the editing, it's the writing of the characters and how they talk. Who really acts that way.
1,Ok, I'm not going to say the idea for the story wasn't interesting and couldn't have been great, but someone desperately needs to edit this work.		The story is simply all over the place. It is NOT consistant for one thing. One paragraph someone knows something, the next paragraph they are shocked to find out the same point that they brought up the paragraph before. It was like that movie where Drew Berrymore has short term memory loss...ARGH! And the main love interest being a puppy one minute and a fully adult male werewolf 6 months later was just not right.		The author tried too hard to incorporate every single paranormal tidbit she could PLUS add some really poorly written B/d/S/m. It simply did not work.		If I were the author I would delete the entire effort and start all over again. Honestly, I do not recommend spending the money on this book.
1,A cliffhanger, but I don't care because I'm not reading anymore.  I skipped too many pages to care what he or she went through or thought.	Cute premise but not worth the money for the amount of pages you get after this story.  97  pages is not worth 2.99
1,2.5 stars I felt that this novel was okay.  After reading the novels synopsis, I expected more emotions and more energy to occur within its pages but after reading it, I felt that the novel had more of an even tone and I have mixed feeling about this.  I understand how the main character felt after being held all those years being locked in her current condition but things were changing, I thought that would change her too.	The novel is told through the eyes of Alice who had been abducted when she was ten.  Now five years later, Alice realizes that things are changing.  Ray wants something else in his life and he expects Alice to help him achieve it.  I felt that Alice was numb as she told her story.  She was living with Ray and people in their neighborhood kept to themselves so no one questioned her existence.  When Ray tells Alice what he needs, I was shocked and then I wondered how she would respond.  As the novel progressed, the lack of energy within it created a hardship for me.  I wanted to know the ending but I also wanted to abandon the book.  I liked how the novel finished out; I just wished it would have ended with some gusto.
1,While the story itself was ok, the writing was pretty bad. Way more detail than needed. Way too many sentences that did not contain clues nor move the plot along. No flow. The character names were very similar sounding which had me quite confused at the beginning. I lost tract of who was who.	There was a total lack of understanding how much conversation can fit in the amount of time needed to walk the distance alluded to.	I won't read any more by this author
1,I wouldn't read another book from this author.  Omg  I put in down once and then pick it up thinking it would get better. Horrible.
1,I learned one thing reading this book. Do not believe any reviews. One reviewer said ''hilarious'' only if you are drunk. The characters were all the same except for their names. They tried to be rude but even that fell flat. I did not find one funny thing in this compilation of words.
1,There were 4 books, none were better than 3 stars, and that one happened to be one I had read.  On the whole, the books were filled with unbelievable situations encountered by poorly defined people who spend a lot of time not acting on thoughts and feelings that are complicated by their inaction.  A vicious circle.  They do have "happy" endings, so I can give 2 stars instead of 1.  I will also say I skimmed a lot because they were uninteresting, but - hey - they they were free.
1,This is yet another of those super low effort publications from the public domain. Art is cheap and there is little work put into making the language engaging for children.		It's too simple for older children and not interesting enough for younger children.
1,I read some of the positive reviews before I purchased this book and after starting it I have to wonder if we read the same book.  One said original and charming.....seriously.  It was about as unoriginal and predictable as they come.  The characters were completely annoying and unrealistic.  I made the mistake of choosing to listen to this on a long car ride while travelling for work.  It was brutal.  I kept rolling my eyes and muttering how ridiculous this book was at my phone screen.  It was so bad, I couldn't even finish it.  I had to listen to the sketchy radio stations instead.  If you like syrupy sweet fluff, then by all means buy it.
1,Not so much
1,Second sentence into the book and it is referred to as a religion- so much for a scholarly approach.	But then the opening "quote" attributed to Siddhartha should have warned me.	Now, show me this author's background, scholarship, training, and practice that even qualifies him to write this book.		In a broad sense there are a few statements that some Buddhists might agree with but that does not qualify the book. One could lift a few statements from any religion just as easily.. As i read through the book I attempted to determine what teacher, tradition, school this author was using as his basis for the book. Perhaps a Google search and a mish-mash of the cites.		I'm sorry but after decades of study and practice I can honestly say that I could not recommend this book for any beginner or curious person. There are much better books available and even a serious Internet search  might be infinitely better. Perhaps by the time the author gets to the 108th edition he might be closer to an explanation of Buddhism.		I was very disappointed in this book. Give the money you are thinking about spending on this book to a homeless person - you'll get a better understanding of Buddhism.
1,Mother Teresa had a large impact on the world of the poor and sick.  Unfortunately, this book is strictly along the propaganda lines that it was all good work.  It mentions some of the criticisms without addressing any of them, simply gliding on with the myth of the loving Mother.		Unfortunately for her victims -- I mean, patients -- The Loving Mother valued suffering as a way to Christ.  This meant that valuable treatments for suffering patients were refused.  People lay screaming in pain rather than receiving pain medications.  People did not receive adequate medical treatment from trained medical personnel, they received inadequate care from medically untrained sisters and volunteers.  This meant that ones who might have been treated successfully were not.  The book describes her as wanting people to have "death with dignity", but her centers did no such thing.		Of course, she herself went to hospital and had modern treatments for various illnesses.		I'm in no way saying that nobody benefited from her work.  Many did.  But the myth of the saintly, blessed woman needs to also honestly face that her saintliness was based on a theology of suffering and blood which gave the ill and dying not much more than a bed to do it on.
1,Utterly inane
1,Could not finish. I found this story trite, poorly conceived and quit frankly, boring. I'm sure Ms. Fredrick has read many romances and believes they are easy to write, but they are not. Few of the scenes sent the plot forward, and the ones I did read needed to be rewritten for clarity and form. The male protagonist comes across as selfish and uncaring to the point of showing too much willingness to let the women in the story take up his slack. I could find little like able in him, and a lot to dislike. The women catering to his selfish behavior need their consciousness raised by several notches, particularly the equally selfish grandmother. Please try again, Ms. Fredrick. You have the basic idea, but need to hone your characterization skills.
1,This book could have easily been a five star read. The simple fact the author didn't do her research into what the military allows in order to join, completely ruined this for me. No branch of the military will allow a dyslexic person to join. If they can't read the test given before you even sign up, they will not allow you to join. I suggest the author do her homework next time.
1,$8K a month selling resale items on Amazon.com is pure pie in the sky. This book talks about buying items at the local pharmacy and selling them on Amazon.com for three times the retail price. She "recommends" you keep records of purchases and sales....duh...it's demanded by the IRS. I love the long disclaimer shirking responsibility for accuracy, etc......if you are a dreamer and have cash to burn...go for it!!! I found it odd that hypothetical examples are given instead actual results from her on lofty pie in the sky records. IF You can make $8K/month selling trinkets for triple the retail price, God bless.
1,...interest in the 'what he believes' series and just did not want to continue. in fast forwarded through most of book 15, was quite bored with Charlotte and Noah in book 13 and just couldn't finish book 16. geez, I've never done that with a book series before. I stopped liking the characters and was just bored with their dialogue! there were just too many twists and turns, as if the author just threw anything in the mix Hopi g some of it would stick. well, it just didn't resonate with me, at all!
1,I'm not sure what I expected, but it wasn't this. The characters were not developed, and quite frankly they were ridiculous. The dialogue between the characters was dull, flat and predictable as was the end of the story. I skipped sentences out of sheer boredom and just to get it finished. I'm thankful that this story was free on my Kindle because it's not worth paying for!
1,Very disappointing. There has been a long wait between novels allegedly because of recent discoveries in Nuremberg. I enjoyed the previous "puzzle" books and to wait such a long time for this terrible book was disappointing. Too many things happening without a conclusion. The main characters who aren't together until the end do not communicate.	The ending is awful, clearly begging for a sequel to bring the book to a conclusion.	I will read the next just to see how it all ends, but unless there is much improvement I will be done with the puzzle books
1,Can't believe I got suckered in. Why can't Amazon let you know ahead of time so that you can make informed decision. Also warn that there is BDSM in the story. Tired of authors or publisher's pulling the wool over my eyes. From now on will only purchase books from my favorite writers.
1,This was too short and not long enough to get a fell for the characters. It had a few errors but nothing too distracting. It would be three stars if it was longer
1,Why pay for information that is free for just a very little searching. (try Wikipedia first...)
1,The author was on to a great story but got lost on the way. Too much missing information in all the books. Before releasing another book you should really read it to see if the story flows.
1,This novel rang false for me. Except for the police procedure bits, it didn't feel authentic in plot, story telling or characterization. To a small extent, after learning of Jenna's hidden past, I had the rest of the plot figured out. I only pressed on to find out if I was correct, and it turns out, I was.		SPOILER!!!  Having never personally known a victim (or is "survivor" the better term) of domestic violence, nor being well versed in this type of tragedy, I could maybe, perhaps believe Jenna's motives in remaining in an abused situation. However, when Ian causes the death of their unborn child, I just couldn't understand why Jenna continued to stay. One would have thought that their death of her child would have been the proverbial "straw that broke the camel's back". Then, on top of this, to think that Jenna would NOT have reported Ian to the police, knowing he was the cause of Jacob's death?!?! Just speaking for myself, I would have used the tragedy of Jacob's death as the springboard for having strong evidence for the police to jail an abusive husband, thereby finally being free of my tormentor. But, as I said, that's just me. I suppose abuse victims don't all react in the same manner.		Also, what I found so unrealistic was how events in Jenna's life so neatly dovetailed with Anya's so that the reader is not yet aware that Jenna is not Jacob's grieving mother. For example, Jenna too just so happens to have a son tragically die. And, as we find out, there was a plausible reason why Jenna was car-less and chose to continue to be without a vehicle. And of course, Jenna was fleeing an abusive relationship, rather than losing herself in isolated grief.  END SPOILER!!		Because I would have done things differently (I hope!), I felt sympathy and compassion for Jenna, but only to a certain degree. Other than her tragic past, there wasn't anything engrossing or compelling about this character, or indeed, any of the other characters in this novel.		Ray and his wife were a mildly engaging take on a long married couple, and how dynamics of a marriage can change, and even perceptions of what each couple wants from a marriage can evolve. Still, that wasn't interesting enough to take up half the novel		In the end, "I Let You Go" was a sub-par novel, filled with sub-par characters. If you have a few hours to fill, go for it. Otherwise, I'm sure there are better books to read.
1,Useless this author is a negative peeps that sounds very unhappy with his life I feel sorry for him good thing that this book is free ......
1,Woefully disappointing; without any hard facts and is wild speculation and misinterpretation of the Biblical verses cited.
1,To be honest this book didn't get good until the last chapter and epilogue. You have Nikki who broke up with Kenneth a year ago. Then she finds out that he's dating her former ex-friend so what does she do? She accepts a date from Kenneth's best friend who just so happened to have had a crush on her this entire time. Now you have these two starting a relationship but the whole time she really wants Kenneth. Long story short, she was messing with Joshua as a rebound while waiting on Kenneth. The story was so drawn out after chapter one all I wanted was the end. Even with it I doubt I'd read the next one because this was just too bland to find out what happens next.
1,Ididnt like this book at all it leaves u hanging n some of the stories were to much for me. Didnt even finish it at the end. Thank God I didn't pay anything for it I would have been really dissapointed!!
1,I won't be reading anymore books by this author.  All her stories are boring. The reason they are SOOO BORING is because authors like this don't read real romance novels. This is obvious by the writing style. Their characters are one dimensional. Therefore, there isn't any life in the story. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!
1,I've read several books this author....she can write.  This is a very poor example, though.  This one almost put me to sleep as it dragged on and on, back and forth with the angst and mumisunderstandings.  I definitely would not recommend this book.  It is a bore.  Try Forbidden Love.
1,What's with the ending? I did not get it. What happen to Cole? Did he survive and have his and Jax happy ending? When is the volume 6 coming out?
1,Weird storyline.  Boring details.  Weird characters.  Boring locales.  Did I mention weird and boring?  Waste of time.  Sorry so harsh.
1,Not my cup of tea. I really tried to like this book but in the end, just could not. If in doubt about reading a book by an author I've never read,  I usually rely on reviews and after trying to read this book, I went back and re-read the very reviews that convinced me to read it in the first place. And, yes, there were so many good reviews!  So, I went back and pushed through to the end. Sounds like I'm describing work!? Yep, that's what it felt like and life is too short to not enjoy reading a book. Wish I had trusted my first and second impressions and stopped wasting my time on this one. Just saying.
1,Mr. Chase, please do not release your novels before they are ready. The amount of grammatical and spelling errors in the "first edition" was ridiculous. This series had potential but was honestly destroyed by the lack of editing it was in serious need of. It seemed extremely amateurish. Had I actually paid for these books I would have requested a refund. I HOPE you found a new editor and that this "second edition" fixes the grammatical and spelling errors in the "First edition" and eliminates all the slashed out parts which were oddly left in the text with a line through them. Of course, a new editor cannot fix a terrible plot, undeveloped characters, and a deus ex machina ending that is laughably bad. I suggest you save your money for something more fun...like a root canal.
1,I don't know why so many good reviews. The husband receives letters from an unknown source that has no direction at all, just to end with a hidden secret of their youth, kind of unbelievable if they had the greatest marriage ever. And if he loved her wife so much, he didn't even have time to mourn her, while getting involved with another woman in less than a year.
1,Every book in this conglomeration was the first of a series... so, basically, what you have here is a load of hooks to sell more books.  I read the first four books and then tired of the author trying to sell me on the next book.  Twin Souls' author took it on him/her self to jab at President Trump and it had nothing to do with the plot.  I'm very sick of people trying to show they are ill wishing my country by bashing the President.  So hackneyed.  So, the gist is, plots weren't riveting, and if you are an unknown author, don't hitch your star to others.  You suffer the fate of the crappy authors.
1,I really  hate to be harsh when submitting  a review but the  book was horrible.  I wish I could  say  one good  thing about it but there is nothing..... no one likable  quality about it.... The main characters are awful,  the girl rants like  a crazy person and the husband comes off as a abusive  jerk... The sex  scenes are ridiculous and raunchy...... and  she goes on about her husbands penis and sex like its the key to all their problems.... and don't  get me started on the slang because it just doesn't fit with the type of life they are trying to portray.  This book is so bad I sent for a refund ..... I don't  recommend  as a buy or even as borrow.....it basically a waste of your time.... I for one will be asking for a refund..... because none of these all these reviews  where miss leading,  for a five star rating it was a  zero star book to bad don't have that option.
1,While the information contained in this booklet is mostly correct, The same level of information could be gained free from most state county extension services. My advice is call them for your state and save the money. Also, on-line info about heritage seeds is available at several gardening websites. The key seems to be that "hybrid" seeds do NOT reproduce eqivalent quality plants when saved from hybrid plants......and agri-biz has "hybridized" nearly EVERYTHING!
1,I gave up half way through this novella.  The story line is a good.  However, the writing is a clinical description of the events in the third person.  With this lack of descriptive writing, events that should be exciting are reduced to a flat list of actions.
1,I haven't bothered to read this, as the sequel to White Feather which I was disappointed with.
1,I did not enjoy this book.  I don't know what I was thinking when I bought it.  I did not care for the characters.  This was a cheesy book that was not written well and did not make me care about any of the characters.
1,There was nothing new in the narcissistic behavior of the Devil.....I found him to be rather immature..not sexy.  Now Diana is another matter...I liked her...but she deserves so much more than she has had in her life.  I have no reason to recommend this book.  I found it quite disappointing and generally lacking.
1,I've waited a few days to write this review and still feel mad about the direction this series has gone inbut here goesI did not like book 7 at all and here's why...		My biggest problem was that Stephen is in no way shape or for a Hero and Kelsey is the dumbest h Ive ever read about. The big question for me is: why does this author seem to hate women so much? Over and over again Stephen treats Kelsey like dog poop but the author keeps on having her come back for more. Why? Because hes hot or Hes So Sexy. Why doesnt Stephen ever get what he deserves for all the terrible things he does? Why is Kelsey always thinking shes betrayed Stephenwhen in reality her retaliation is NOTHING compared to what Stephen does to her. Theres no comparison. Why must Kelsey be virginal when Stephen is able to be a whore? Wanting someone b/c they are good looking and forgiving them for the horrible things they do to you, because they are hot, is NOT love and it makes you an idiot. So thats where Kelsey is at. She. Is. DUMB. And I cant root for her anymore or forgive the author for ruining what could have been a great character.		Major spoilers ahead for the series...so don't read on if you don't want to know...		My experiences are as follows...I feel like I have to go through the history of pain I suffered through reading these books so Im starting at the beginning when I still had hope.		I was really enjoying these books. It can be a roller coaster ride at times but I love that. In book one we meet the h, Kelsey. She gets her heart broken by her best friend Tracy and the guy she's been in love with since she was a girl, Michael. Tracy and Michael hook up and get marriedeven though her Tracy knows that Kelsey loves Michael. Nice. The h is obviously devastated but does she tell the bff or the guy to take off? No! She acts like a doormat and is the maid of honor at their wedding! This drove me crazy. The h is then told to take an internship in NYC, by her dad, where she then has to live with her jerk bff Tracy and her new hub Michael. It's brutal, especially when she can hear them do it. But she's determined to get Michael back. It's pathetic. I wish she'd drop both Tracy and Michael. Tracy is the most toxic friend ever...with friends like her who needs enemies!		We have more low points of doormatness from Kelsey but then she meets Stephen and she finally starts growing a pair. She doesn't know what is coming over her but she's learning how to stick up for herself. I loved this...I love it when h's wake up and realize they don't have to take being treated like crapola. Slowly Kelsey appears to be leaving being a total doormat behind. She's not perfect, still has set backs and the doormat comes out but as a reader I have hope for her...she's getting stronger...that is until this book 5.		Stephen is definitely not a perfect H and that was ok in books 1-4. The H and h weren't really committed to trying out a relationship until book 4. He had his share of encounters with other women. But in book four the H and h decide to give a relationship a go for a period of time. They promise not to see other people during this time. And I'm excited as a reader to see where their relationship goes.		Now we come to book 5. Stephen and Kelsey are still playing the cat and mouse game about doing it (she's a virgin but hadn't told Stephen. Stephen says he doesn't sleep with virgins. The h is afraid to tell him). It's been 5 books and they still haven't done the deed? It's getting annoying at this point. Kelsey repeatedly throws herself at Stephen in this book but he won't do the nasty with her. She even signs some lame contract agreeing to be his sexual partner (this made no sense as they red lined the entire contract and there were NO penalties if Kelsey broke the contract). One minute she would tell him the contract meant nothing and then the next she'd drama queen it up and say Stephen owned her. No he doesn't chick...remember, nothing would happen if the contact was broken...except that she wouldn't be able to see Stephen. By the end of this book I was praying she'd rip the contract and throw it in his face.		And now we come to the storyline that makes Stephen the biggest anti-hero on the planet. A high school girl that Stephen has helped try to cure of cancer has become terminal again and only has a week to a month to live. Kelsey meets Kate (the high school cancer girl) when Stephen goes to inform Kate she's terminal. Stephen and Kate share an extremely inappropriate hug and other moments that make Kelsey uncomfortable at their meeting. Kelsey even mentions that it's a little too close for comfort. Life goes on for a few days and then Stephen abruptly leaves Kelsey at brunch with his horrible mother and psychopath ex-girlfriend. The h doesn't hear from the H for a while but then he calls and let's Kelsey know he'll be with Kate until she dies. Kind of weird but Kelsey is understanding. Then one night Kelsey sees a gossip site and finds out Stephen has married the high school girl and they are on their honeymoon. WHAT?! She is of course devastated and leaves Stephen's apartment, where she was staying, and runs off to Texas to visit a friend. Kelsey meets a great guy in Texas and I'm thrilled b/c Stephen doesn't deserve dirt from the bottom of her shoe. But of course he calls her and says that he loves her and not to give up on him or believe everything she sees. He promises to ruin the guy if she continues to hang out with him. WhAT?! Ok, so that ruins everything with the nice guy. Fast forward to Stephen getting home and Kelsey kind of standing up for herself a little bit. Kate has died and Stephen is trying to bully Kelsey into going to the funeral but she says no way. Great! Things are not great between the H and h. Kelsey rightly feels betrayed by him...but she's still not sticking up for herself as much as I'd like. She gets a copy of Kate's diary where it's confirmed that Stephen deflowered the high school student, Kate. They basically live out the fantasy version of how Stephen told Kate that he and Kelsey had met. He and Kate reenact everything (except for the losing the virginity part--because Kelsey hasn't lost her v-card to Stephen yet.). So creepy on so many levels. Stephen is such a selfish scum bag and not that sorry about what he did. Kelsey even says that he through away their relationship to live out this creepy fantasy for Kate. I don't care if she was terminal. Stephen told Kelsey that he loves her. You don't run off and do a high school girl when you are in love with someone. Period. End of story. Anyhow...Kelsey's friend tells her she should always forgive Stephen because of some big bogus reason. I'm sorry...running away with a teenager, marrying her, and sleeping with her is, in my book, UNFORGIVABLE! No matter what secret bull he's doing. So here's where Kelsey takes 100 million footsteps backward and regresses into an extremely pathetic doormat again. She basically lets Stephen off the hook and forgives him...and is almost apologetic to him. I HATED that she didn't tell him to go to beat it. He should be spending all of book 6 groveling.		Still building up to book 7....but right now...Book 6  does Stephen grovel? NO! Is He Sorry about Kate? NO! In fact he admits that he had always wanted to sleep with Kate. This is so sickening I wanted to throw my iPad across the room. And what does doormat Kelsey say to this? That shes glad he told her. WHAT? Give me a break. All the reviews claimed and the author claims that Stephen redeems himself in this book. When? I certainly didn't read about any redemption at all. In fact he goes on a s to the e x spree with anyone and everyone. Sleeping with all the people that Kelsey cant stand and more. Even sleeps with someone in Kelseys bed. So gross! I guess we were supposed to feel sorry when he thought he was watching Kelsey sleep with Chase. The Book is in Stephens POV at this point and being in his head makes me hate him just that much more. The Thing about Kelseys revenge was that it was all fake. She didn't sleep with Chase and most of what Stephen saw was created videos so he would lose it. I did not feel sorry for him at all when he saw the Chase and Kelsey Videosin fact I felt that justice was served. He deserved a taste of his own medicineI just wish Kelsey had really gone through with it instead of faked it. Which brings me back to my earlier pointwhy must Kelsey be virginal when Stephen can act like a wh to the ore. Id love to see Kelsey have some affairs with other people and enjoy themnot feel guilty for one moment that shes experimenting. She certainly deserves it. Blah Blah Blah lots of confusing chapters b/c sections were left out...blah blah Stephen marries Kelsey at the end of this book --which def does NOT redeem him imo--and now we are on to book 7.		My problem with this latest book: Oh book 7you are by far the worst, most jumbled, and boring book of the series. This was the first time I skimmed pages. The plot twists were soooo badKelsey an 8 year old assassin? Ridiculous! All the spy stuff and talks of killing people off? SO STUPID. Lots of new characters who aren't developed properly--Who is Jay anyway? He kind of comes out of nowhere and isn't an interesting twist at all. Neither is his mother--dumb twist. Jay holds a fake sex tape over Kelsey's head--that she thinks will ruin her relationship with Stephen so she is at Jay's "mercy" and will do anything he says including saying she'll kill people for him? Yeah right...just ridiculous. You'd think since she claims to love justice so much that she'd let a video get out over killing families. Still don't know why people were killed but this book just b/c someone didn't go to jail. Huh? This was a giant confusing mess that did not move the plot at all. Brother twist is a who cares moment. Stick to what you know , author, angst. You are good at writing angst. In about the 80% markStephen, who is still married to Kelsey, takes a model on a date so shell sign a contract for his company. What? Kelsey has to sit there and watch another woman be all over himand she has to grin an bear it. If the tables were turned, Stephen would lose his mind and he would make Kelsey stop. Thats another thing that really bothers me--the double standards of this series has for Kelsey and Stephen. Its not fair and I hate it. When is he ever going to be given what he deals out? He still deserves a lesson about how to treat the person he loves but clearly he will never get one. Back to the storylater in the evening they go to a clubwell Stephen and his entourage go with the model and Kelsey is with her team. Stephen talks about the girls hed like to shag on the dance floor and then goes out and starts dancing with random women. He is basically shagging it up and making out with another woman on the dance floorwhile Kelsey watches. Other things happen. Kelsey leaves Stephen to go to a hotel room b/c of a fight they have. Stephen cheats on Kelsey with the model he went on a date with (even though he didn't go all the way through with it its still cheating in my book). And of course Kelsey, dummy that she is forgives him b/c hes hot and great in the sack. I. AM. DONE! To top it off, this author has extended this series to 8 booksbecause she couldn't figure out how to upload the entire book at one time. Im so sure. If that were the casethe 8th book would be uploaded by now. I think she wanted to stretch this out as far as she could. NOT COOL. Stop the excuses. Not that I really care any more b/c I just don't care what happens to these characters any more. I could care less what happens to S and K...the deserve their unhappily ever after...because based on everything I've read, that's what it will be.		My final advicedont read this series unless you are a glutton for punishment.
1,Cute story, but too short with abrupt ending.  Nothing else to say to fill in word requirement.  Have fun reading.
1,Stupid people doing stupid things to save the world... Will not read the sequel.
1,I like some of this author's other work. I'm not sure what is meant by "adapted from" another book by another author, but I think the interaction of the characters, wardrobe descriptions and also the use of "his" instead of "him" repeatedly suggests that this "adaption" was more of a search and replace job, with genders and gender pronouns and first names rather sloppily substituted.
1,Really unbelievable and misguided. I couldn't get into the love story but it has its funny moments. Characters were very mismatch.
1,I am sorry, this story fails to build its foundation in a forthright matter and takes way too much for granted.  I can suspend disbelief but only so far.  I will not be pursuing any future volumes in this series.
1,This story ends at 50% in... just beware.  I somehow missed the summary that said the entire other book was included here too.		Even more disturbing, however, is how SHALLOW this story is.  I have hard time with instalove suspense romance.		Maddie the school teacher learns that her FBI agent husband has been killed and she's hauled into questioning.... grieving and in shock she then learns that he's not all he seemed to be -- hidden bank accounts, arms dealers and she herself might be in danger after house blows up and she needs to go into witness protection immediately.  She meets Michael, a US Marshal -- and although she's JUST learned her husband is killed and possibly involved in some shady stuff -- she still gets tingles in the you know where when she meets him.		And that's where this story went south for me.  There's very little dialogue so it's hard to understand this attraction or why he's willing to break protocol in order to sleep with her, while they're on the run and going into witness protection and while he's injured.  WHAT??		SPOILER ALERT: there's a proposal only 4 days after they meet.
1,Review courtesy of Dark Faerie Tales		Quick & Dirty: Inked was not my kind of dystopian read. It was unrealistic and lacked the crucial connection between the reader and the characters.		Opening Sentence: Three days.	My thin leather shoes slapped softly against the dirt leading away from grandmothers cottage as I made my way across our stretch of farmland located at the edge of Frosthaven.		The Review:		Another dystopian story but regrettably, not a very good one.		Inked contained elements of the Insurgent series by Veronica Roth. In Insurgent, individuals are shown a simulation that encourages them to choose a faction, which essentially defines how they spend the rest of their lives. Simiarly, in Inked, the ink is used to determine each persons fate, with the government having the ultimate control of everyones ambitions.		The story is told from Caenums perspective and I felt sorry for him when his world turns upside down following the entrance of the scribes for his inking but I couldn't connect with his character or the story. I couldn't understand how he was planning to leave his grandmother and Dreya when he claimed to love them both so much and they were the only family he had just because he was scared of being inked. Actually, I take that back. I understood him leaving, I just couldn't take him seriously.		Caenum and Dreyas almost-romance would have been cute if there was anything remotely romantic involved. Instead there were assumptions of being each others soul mates without admitting it out loud, which was really weird.		Rausch, I started, trying not to look too pathetic.	He noticed immediately.	What is it with you people and these sad good-byes? he scoffed. Go fight the good fight, and make your way back to this one. And yes, I promise to marry her if anything happens to you, as we agreed. He winked and reached between the bars of the gate to give me a nudge.		I liked Kenzies character though, he seemed crazy enough to be real and apart from that I cant think of much else I enjoyed about this book. There was a lot of taboo first about not getting inked, then about those that were inked, it was rather silly really. If it is a series, its not one I will spend my time reading.		Notable Scene:		The Citadel tries to force people into roles, into walks of life. Gives them assignments based on what they are born with, Dreya said, as Ryst knelt down and gingerly touched the vines that wrapped around Rauschs body. But leaders aren't born. They are made. All of your confusion, all those questions, they brought you here. According to the Citadel, you might have been born to work the land. But according to the fate youve made for yourself, you were meant to save it.		FTC Advisory: Bloomsbury Spark provided me with a copy of Inked. No goody bags, sponsorships, material connections, or bribes were exchanged for my review.
1,It just didn't hold my interest.
1,Am I the only one who is tripping over $6 for 107 pages? I started this series off first and even after not liking book 1, I still read 2-3. I now know these characters is from her other books, so I guess I'm off to reading the others before I completely wash my hands.
1,I really don't understand why this is the third in the series instead of the first.  I also really despise sexual harassment and when an employer seduces an employee, even if consensual, in my book it is sexual harassment.		Another thing, if there are going to be lion shifters, I'd like a good bit fo the story to involve actually shifting into lions.		And for goodness sake, one would expect an author to remember the names of the characters from one book to the next.  The name of Cain's fated mate is Brenna, not Char, and there is no excuse for that mistake.
1,This story was so long and drawn out with so much description that I started skipping just to end the tedium. The plot was ok but you had to slog threw to much unnecessary crap to get to it. Disappointing, but not the worst book I've read.
1,I had enjoyed previous entries from this author, sadly this one let me down.  Several side plots are introduced and immediately resolved before any depth can be had.  The event that should have spawned the most drama and tension between the main characters is immediately succeded by a time skip to the wrap up 'boy that sure was some drama and tension we had in those years nobody read about'.  The story has a lot of potential that is never realized due to the abrupt endings.
1,A family reunion, just a bit saccharine. Not a lot of novelty, more like a cliche, an amalgamation of many similar, equally predictable yarns.
1,Angst, questions, and stupidity.  A summer than rocks heroine who could not find an answer for 1 +1 spends at least 57% of this book asking questions and being angry.  Wasted money.  So disappointing.
1,I really didn't like it. It jump around to much. Just boring not exciting like the first one and to have a third  one is just ridiculous. I will not be reading that
1,I tend to like stories about kidnaps, dark relationships, and the whole thematic, but this one was a mess.		It starts out well and my curiosity was picked when I read the sample. It had potential. I thought I was going to read something in the lines of the Dark Duet. It isn't! It's a mix of a lot of things, which makes it a mess. It's like Captive in the Dark meets Fifty Shades of Gray while hanging out with the Missionary! It doesn't make sense!		Tess is sold. You have the bad guy (Q), that -wait - is not bad, but nobody tells Tess about it, like that is a big secret. She is being held captive, but is free to go, though she does know it. He wants her, but his tormented by his desires (he even has a red room)! Please! It's just too much without any sense!		The book is a mess!
1,I found this book almost embarrassing to read. The plot was unrefined and the character of Lizzy was immature and irritating.
1,This was so unbelievable that I could never recommend it to anyone. I definitely will not be getting the next book.  Just remember I warned everyone to not waste your money or your time.
1,Not great perfect for a quick read while in a waiting room
1,I found this book to be irritating, not funny.  It wasn't even remotely believe able and then ended so abruptly.  It was a mess and I found myself skimming the last half of the book to end my misery.  I can't recommend this book.
1,I'm going to be the lone dissenter among all these 5 star reviews. The blurb for this novella intrigued me, as it was centered around a couple reunited after the battle of Waterloo. The H (Paul) went to war shortly after their marriage and except for one visit has not seen the h (Hetty) for 5 years. Paul's brother had died while Paul was away, making Paul the new Earl. Why Paul didn't immediately sell his commission and return home is left unclear. His cousin Lewis is the heir presumptive, and has been helping Hetty run the estate. He is also clearly in love with her. Hetty is in London a couple of weeks after Waterloo because she has had no word from or about her husband, so she doesn't know if he is dead or alive. She is at a ball (?) with Lewis when her husband strolls in, bigger than life ~ their meeting is tentative and awkward and so the story begins. This could have been a great story! Paul suffers from debilitating migraines due to a long healed head injury, and also from PTSD in the form of horrifying nightmares. There is no long, drawn out pretense of hiding these things from Hetty ~ she finds out in the first day or so about his issues. Their first sexual encounter was also unusual for an HR, in that it was a failure, due to his premature ejaculation - a very different twist. So why the 2 stars? Many of the conversations throughout the story seemed disjointed and incomplete, with a stray non sequitur or two thrown in. There were many inconsistencies as well ~ Hetty thinks about their lovely courtship, but later in the book their marriage is referred to as being arranged. Hetty came in from an outing, ordered a light dinner, went to her room to change her clothing, then went down to order a light dinner. Paul called Lewis "Paul" during one conversation, and Paul was referred to as	"Lewis" in a later chapter. Hetty was shocked to hear about Lewis being in deep debt, and appeared just as shocked a chapter later when she was again told of Lewis being in debt. *sigh* I'm sad to say that there are more examples. The "villain" was telegraphed right from the beginning, so no mysteries here. He spreads a very lame rumor that Paul is "mad" and violent, and of course everyone believes that the big, strong, charismatic war hero who is idolized by all, is suddenly "mad", no proof required. I actually rolled my eyes at the ending, when the villain, along with some burly goons, force their way into the house. The villain then crashes into Paul and Hettie's bedroom, "commitment" papers clutched in his hot little hands, ready to take Paul off to the asylum ~ because anyone can totally get papers to commit an Earl without so much as a Doctor's examination. The villain is conveniently killed when his gun misfires, leading to our HEA. One last nit-pick ~ Every. Single. Time. a word was italicized (and there were many), there was no space between it and the adjacent word, making weird half italicized- half regular mash-ups ~ a very odd formatting issue. Could have been a terrific little story, in the right hands.
1,This series quickly went down hill. Got so tired of reading about the kid whining about the girl. Just nonstop to the point it completely drowned out the story. Thought the concept had promise. Here is a question: If you have a community that can't touch metal thus defend themselves how does the community still exist led by some child molesting priests? Maybe it is answered down the line but can't read any further.
1,I wanted to love this book but it was just weird. I enjoyed the writing but the story never really grabbed me. Perhaps I'm just not into this type of tale.
1,I made it about a third of the way through this book, then just gave up. There was no depth to any of the characters, and it was full of run on sentences.  The amnesia and attempt at mystery seemed strained and unbelievable.  The writing style was choppy and hard to read.  I usually find something good to say about most books, but this one just didn't cut it.  Sorry!
1,it was an average read this time. I didn't think there was much excitement or suspense in this book. I also figured out who the murderer probably was early on in this book. I think with Stone being gone, wherever he is, it takes away from a lot of the excitement.
1,next to worthless for study of the Bible as he only comments on very few verses and those generally not of great interest. Not recommended.
1,It was ok not as good as i hoped
1,The plot was pretty outlandish, but I'm not exactly looking for 100% plausible when it comes to erotica. The quick pace, and extremely transparent mystery that framed the setting, were the only things that preventing me from adding it to my Goodreads so-bad-I-cant-finish pile. It just wasn't my jam, but if you're an adult that still watches Nickelodeon & the Disney channel unironically, this might be the book for you.
1,I only read ten percent of this book. It was totally unrealistic and ridiculous. Poppy McGuire is a newspaper reporter with a police officer boyfriend. She runs off from her job to join him and investigate the crime. She has total access to the crime scene and acts as a full fledged "detective"! AND there is a whole series of this.
1,ok
1,This book was sssoooo childish! I didn't even read past 15%...there was little to no dialogue...they got in a relationship within 2days...the author need to not rush her stories and try and fit so much in it...and let the characters talk that's how we as readers get a feel for their personality...thank Goodness for kindle unlimited!
1,Imho the author should try contemporary romance since the manners and customs of the period seemed have escaped her.  Not terrible but jarring and knocked me right out of the story.
1,I purchased this book based on the star recommendations and I have to say I was very disappointed. Predictable and I just could not get into it. I have read books with the exact story line and been pleasantly surprised with them so I took a chance. Don't waste your money or your time. I wish the story had delved more deeply into the main character Ken and his struggle to make his life his own. Andy the other MC didn't even interest me.
1,The first 3 were pretty good, and  got though them fast. But this one it took me two weeks what should have taken 1 or two days. Boring and slow, then I had had enough with her oh poor me stuff. So good start but carp ending.
1,I found this very sophmoric. Too many typo and grammar errors made it a difficult read. I struggled getting through this, but alwats try to finish what i start
1,Did not keep my interest.
1,I now remember why I quit reading this series.  Cannot suspend my belief enough to continue.  Not a fan of instant sex in the graphic description newer authors are so fond of.  Torque wrench for twerk wrench.  A battle ship has to go back to refuel after a couple of hours???  Just not believable  for future space travel to different galaxies.  I skipped several books in this series in hopes  the author would mature in her stories.  Nope.  Book 11 and same ridiculous wording, good start with story line then the porn starts.  The story is very predictable after that.  If this were a book I'd toss it, but I love my kindle.
1,Very disappointing!  The author has designed this whole series to get more money.  However, the story is not worth the price of one.  This is a continuing story of a wealthy man and poor man getting together.  The romance was accomplished early on and then the romance was turned into frequent blah sex.		Most of the dialog is like teenaged girls talking.  Ion's recalcitrant mother was ridiculous in that she defied everybody, including her husband.		The whole story could have been told quickly and cost a lot less money.  I average purchasing four books a week but I will not ever be buying any more books by T. A. Chase.  Save your money and time and pass this series up.
1,Not a book I would brag about to my friends but it is an okay read.  A crazy person who becomes a serial killer that had a horrible child life.
1,I wanted to like it, but I couldn't get past the third chapter - the story was just bland
1,I didn't order or receive this item.  I think I have been hacked or my late wife's daughter is using our account.
1,I read this book because I loved the story about Jada in the book published before this.  This story was not strong, truly disappointing.
1,I really couldn't get into either character. The premise of the actions and reactions of the MCs felt unrealistic or disjointed to me. Darn. I had high hopes for this one with all the good ratings. The story was promising but so many of the emotions did not feel authentic...or maybe it was just the writing style; as it guess felt more 'high school' than real world to me. I did enjoy his Italian family and especially his 'ma'. Had potential... but missed the mark for me.
1,All the books were the same story with only change in characters and their lives. Some had different romance but it still turned out the same.
1,i've about had it with Rice.  Books have way too many errors. Both in logic and editing. actions and quotes attributed to one character are actually those of a different one.  Characters have powers that are godly and no logical explanation is given for how they got them. They just sort of wake up with them. Battles are won characters survive the unsurvivable and the only explanation for how it could happen is that the character can't believe it.  It's too bad, the story ideas are good, I just wish a good writer was telling the stories.  I supposed it's my own fault.  I keep buying these books hoping things will get better but apparently I'm just enabling this continued dribble.
1,I found the writing to be basic, the characters to be bland and the plot to be dull.  The author kept throwing in the Boston accent at random during the book that made reading distracting.
1,I can see that my review is out of sync with the majority of reviews. I love good mysteries and many of the popular cozy mystery series. Elizabeth Peters' Amelia Peabody series and Sanda Balzo's Maagy Thorsen mysteries are examples of the kinds of books I enjoy in this genre. But I was completely off base when I picked this one up. I found the story shallow, predictable, boring, and disorganized. The characters were poorly developed and the scenes jumped around in a most distracting way. The story is set in Carlsbad, NM. Cinnamon and her visionary sidekick, Burro, are civil rights investigators. Cinnamon tries to take as many cases in New Mexico as possible because she believes there are clues to her missing mother's whereabouts in the region. There is a murder in the caverns and somehow Cinnamon and Burro become involved in the investigation. Of course there are ties to her long lost mother. The book ends abruptly, but I guess that is to encourage you to buy the next book. I, however, find reading one to be quite enough.
1,Yes, I relly hate Haley in this story please what's wrrong with you girl you have everything, your husband very obssessed with you!  Because of the annoying heroine I stop reading at chapter 16..grrrr
1,Not for me
1,Have not read tet
1,I think the huge thing for me was the language barrier. This book is British. With British sayings, mannerisms, slang, etc. I had a hard time understanding/translating the humor and quirks. If you are familiar with His dialect, you probably will really enjoy the book.
1,Omg the worst book ever don't bother I'm so disgusted right know I can hardly speak,,, I couldn't even finish the book
1,It felt amateurish. To sweet and one of the MC's was too weak for my taste. I understand that all the following books are built on this one but setting up the main characters already was annoying. Just sayin.
1,First book was better than second,  this book got boring half way thru, not going to waste my time reading the third book..
1,I can tell the author is very talented, even though I didn't connect with THIS story. It was just missing that piece of puzzle or edge to make it a book that I'd want to come back to. I thought that Yulian & Julian relationship was not developed as it should be for the readers to invest into them. Each time these two was in each other present, there wasn't anything calm about their visits. Yulian has no real character development. His motivation for his interest in the Julia is rather laughable. Julia Stern is a reporter, who is stubborn and a spitfire striving to prove herself in the journalism world. Yulian Gornakov is a Russian Billionaire with family ties to the Russian Mob. The major issue was the story was rushed and it was unrealistic that the couple met once during an TV interview, showed no interest in each other and the next time meeting they are kissing and later that day declaring their love for one another???.I guess my problem was there were a number of parts that just didn't make sense to me. There was a lighter side to the supporting bad boy characters and the violence usually portrayed in the mafia world. I wish the author had stayed with her original way of writing style. This book was OK, but not as good as the previous books, IMO.
1,I was disappointed with this book. There was  not much matchmaking just talk. I enjoyed the Darcy and Lizzie and their happy marriage. The book lacked depth. I would pass on this.
1,Theo was having some "mechanical" issues with his wife, so he decided  to have it the checked out by the doc. The doc was very thorough with his examination. Everything was working perfectly fine.
1,At times this felt like a story someone had written for ASSM in 1986 then dusted off, threw in a few references to modern life and published.  A top of the line motocross bike for 2300 dollars?  Not happening. A 2015 Yamaha YZ250F is $7950 on the interwebs.  A college girl describing someone as a 'chauvinist'? C'mon, fight the patriarchy!  But just so we know it's happening right now we get a running advertisement for Google Calendar.		Poor Carmen.  So broke and in debt she has to live with her sister in the bad part of town.  How bad is it?  Well, Carmen has a Hispanic last name... shudder.  It's going to take her a year to save up $8000 for a legal judgement against her. Eventually, I guess, that wasn't working for the author so about halfway through the story she has an extra thousand dollars a month to move out.  Meh, plot points, we don't need no stinking plot points.		And Bonnie, well I guess Bonnie is perfect.  In the paragraph describing her first appearance, no less than three times, 'perfect' is used to describe her attributes.  Carmen doesn't like Bonnie-types, of course. Carmen is not a lesbian, of course (NOT being stressed by the author in the story).  Except when Bonnie walks in Carmen is instantly gay curious and all about the Bonnie-types- Ummm?		Poor Carmen is so confused.  She confused when Bonnie leers at her and flirts with her and sucks Carmen's fingers in the bathroom after Carmen masturbates and forces their bodies together in the office.  Does that mean Bonnie likes her?  Carmen doesn't know.  She knows she maybe wants to have that cool sex thing with Bonnie, but does Bonnie want her? That licking sticky fingers in the bathroom was just so vague.  So confusing.  When does Carmen figure out what Bonnie wants?  When Bonnie helps Carmen distribute coffee in the office!  So that's the global sign of lesbian lust I've been missing?  Handing out coffee?		There are also just enough typos, missing punctuation and improper cases to assure readers that this story had never seen a critical eye before publication.
1,I have read in numerous reviews where other reviewers say they wish that the "discount/free" reviewers would state that up front, so they didn't "waste their time reading something people have been paid to write." Well, I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review, and for those of you who think I have "been bought" by Amazon or the sellers to write something glowingly positive, let me tell you:  As a fellow Amazon customer, I rely on the reviews of others to help me decide whether to purchase a product or not, and would never endorse a product if I did not truly believe in the quality--if I don't like something you're going to know I don't and why.  So if you think that these discounted rate purchase reviews are contrived, those from some other reviewers may be, but anything I say is the honest truth.  If my opinion of this product changes, or if the product does not perform as expected, I will change my review so you can know too.  Please thumbsup my review if it has helped you decide in any way. Thanks!!!		This is titled, "Adult coloring books," but this is not an adult coloring book. Yes, there are some cutesy pictures but they lack the detail I expect in an "adult coloring book." That being said, my 8 year old daughter thinks they are pretty cool...
1,Ok I really don't know where to start other then to say I couldn't finish it....the story has NO direction NONE. I thought it was just me or maybe my kindel deleted all the I don't know substace. I really don't want to be mean but it will sound mean anyway...its almost as if the author was writting high or drunk and thought they wrote one thing, hence the more put together description, but they just forgot they where on something and sent it out to be published without re-reading it or what the heck there is no or! I comend the author for getting their book out and following their dream, but please revisit this story. Re write it! Spelling and the minor stuff I'm not big on at all, I'm borderline dylexsic; but when when I kept going back pages or even a paragraph thinking I must have missed I something I started forward, and yeah I ended up deleting without even finishing it.  I don't judge books by their cover or reviews because if found real gems on fanfiction sights that have turned into published authors, Lizzy ford to name one, and I read about five to six books and novellas a week, considering my lil vice I can't always pay full price for my literary fix, so I love freebies. Falling in love and losing virginity (which we had no clue was present till a few chapters later) in a day has been done before and ehh though not my favorite it has worked or flowed in other stories, this one nope not so much and certainly not after being kept sedated for quite a while.
1,Spoiler alert: This book felt stilted and awkward. I just couldn't believe they had a happily ever after when they could barely communicate throughout most of the book. The hero made no sense. He was modern enough to DJ and move to America, but he floundered when trying to convey his romantic interests. Why would a player in Japan come to America not know when a woman wants him, espessially a socially awkward one? The physical signs of attraction are universal; he should have known she wanted him from jump.
1,I downloaded Shadow Play as a free book from Amazon. The fact this book has any 4 and 5-star reviews completely puzzles me. Ryder was a complete ass -taking away people's free will by using compulsion to influence actions or ask questions. His arrogance was a complete turn-off. Kyra wasn't much better. For a woman almost 200 years old she acted like a sullen teen, walking blindly into traps and ruled by hormones instead of common sense. The characters made decisions and took actions that questionably advanced the story line progression but were nonsensical. The premise for the story had lots of possibilities, but too weird, disjointed, and lacking in logic to hold my attention. I read up to 40 percent and just couldn't stand another page--one of the few books in which I disliked the whole cast of characters and saw nothing redeeming in the protagonists' relationship (such as it was).
1,My second book by the author, and did not enjoy it as much as the first.  Maybe the length prevented me from becoming engaged with the characters?  Plus, I was surprised Burke did not take Staff (I would have changed that name, for sure) to task for trying the steal the recipe from his competition.  Would I really want to be with someone who would go to those great lengths to cheat?  My answer is NO.
1,This book is like an Amanda Quick wannabe. The plot is so weak and thin and tries to copy other historical romance authors. I stopped reading it after the 8th chapter.
1,This story felt incomplete. There were a lot of gaps in the story that were never explained. The male character is a pilot who has a reputation as a jerk. The female lead is a stewardess. Even before the flight, she wanted to quit. Not really sure why. He gets fired as a pilot, and the reasons for that weren't really clear to me either. They start dating. That part of the story was good. They dated, they talked, they connected. The story talked about Neil starting a new business, but never discussed if he actually did this or not. She apparently stops working as a flight attendant but doesn't appear to be looking for a job. She keeps having problems with nausea and vomiting, but it doesn't occur to her that she might be pregnant. She finally works that out as a possibility, but Neil appears less than happy about it or maybe he's just lukewarm. He the same goes out and without consulting her, buys a house! What?!?  They adopt his niece and the story ends. It didn't feel finished or complete. I'm not sure why the woman was Black. As that appeared to play no real issue in their relationship. The story wasn't horrible, it just was not remarkable or memorable, nothing about it stood out as something good or great.
1,Returned to Kindle Unlimited
1,One of the challenges that authors have is how to create flawed characters without making them unlikeable. In HDU, the heroine (Amanda) is written with few redeeming qualities. The biggest issue for me was that she belonged to that group of people who devote themselves to celebrity gossip - this is Amanda's life. In some ways, however, she redeems herself but it's a long, slow slog until then.		Liam (H), seems like a good guy with a good head on his shoulders. However, the first few chapters that include him shows him as an obnoxious jerk. Again, it's a long, slow journey until we figure him out. Even then, the payoff isn't as rich as it could be. If the tension in these characters is supposed to draw us in, shouldn't the payoff be as rich as the conflict? In this case, I feel like the balance is tilted toward the drama and not the rich reward of the relationship. I believe there is an HDU 2 coming but not sure I'll read it. I only barely stuck it out to finish this one.
1,I already read this in the collection Vampires! A Bundle of Blood.... I dislike her short storries
1,The love was evident. The climax never happened. Pretty plateau the whole time. I just kept waiting... but it never got interesting. BUT because it was SWEET I gave it 2 stars. Could've been appropriate for a 14 yr old
1,Started off ok, but the ending and certain things in the last few chapters were just not good for a relationship. It's a book, but just not feeling it.
1,I received a copy of this book from Netgalley/Entangled Publishing for an honest review. I liked the plot of the story.  Hunter and Tess have a history.  He has money now and offers Tess money if she will play his fianc&eacute; for a weekend.  The "F" word is used a lot in this book.  I believe it especially took away from the type of person that Hunter turned out to be.  There was lots of chemistry.  To me some of the situations and locations of the intimate scenes just didn't work.  I felt that they took away from the story.
1,I was hoping the 2nd book would be better but it seemed to get worse.  Felt like Liam and Ella/Julie was bipolar through the whole book.  It was a constant fight and "I can't live without you" drama the whole time.  Absolutely no emotional pull and to pull out story lines out of the left field, it was annoying.  If you were on the fence on the 1st book, the this one did NoT get any better.
1,I have to admit, after reading the first book, I didn't even read this one.
1,Negative stars.  I only made it through to about 3/4 of the first book.  I found it depressing, extremely brutal toward women and overall distasteful.  Definitely written as a man's fantasy and possibly a man who hates women.  I have images from what I read that I am having trouble getting out of my head; very disturbing.
1,The writing is not the problem. Delinsky is a great writer. The story was short and could have been much better.
1,Some of these are moderately interesting. Some of them are incredibly stupid. At least one of them has horrible continuity errors, and one of them keeps switching between first and third person. Lots of "novelettes" aka short stories, mostly just set ups for books to buy. I wouldn't bother.
1,This is the most superficial treatment of characters and P 'n P themes that I have read. It is tolerable only because -  familiar as the reader will undoubtedly be with the characters who appear - it is the reader who supplies all the nuance, character development, and context required of any decent story.  Certainly the author does little more than write in cliches and summary statements.
1,storyline/plot is interesting. I don't like the fact that it skipped ahead 18ish years from the previous book. I hate when authors do that. I wanted to continue the story of the parents, it was going soooo good. oh well. this one was good too, as far as stories go, it does hold your interest.
1,Reviews compare this book to Iain Banks. However, to me, there is no comparison. Where Banks is intelligent, consistent, and thought through, this book is inconsistent, plodding, and doesn't understand basics of physics or science.		The star ship travel is especially bad. It's written exactly as if star ships, small things in a very large 3D/4D space, are instead water ships, on a 2D surface, running on a large lake. The rest of the physics/science in the story has similar problems -- you have to dis-believe too much, and it continually jars your enjoyment of the book.		There are also editing problems, what seems like made-up words or words used in ways I wouldn't expect, and other such mistakes. For self-published books, that's an all-too-common flaw, but that doesn't forgive it, only explain it.
1,This extremely short began at Kindle Loc 18 (3%) and ended at Loc 313 (54%) and took about 10 minutes to read. The remaining 46% is advertising. At $3, that is the equivalent of paying $18 for an hour of reading material! Don't waste your money on this. The writing leaves much to be desired. I have to agree with the the reviewer that described parts of this as cringe worthy. I actually laughed at the sounds uttered by the main characters during the sex scene. I really doubt that was the reader reaction the author was aiming for. The editing and proofreading appeared to be nonexistent.
1,For someone who suffers from extreme anxiety and avoids unfamiliar people, places, and things that you let a perfect stranger sweep you off your feet, have dinner with them and then have sex, it is hard to believe. But then this is only a short story.
1,It is erotica and only 53 pages long, so to be honest I was not expecting a great plot or well developed characters.. but I did expect an entertaining and hot reading.	Kylie is in charge of the opening of a new Resort; while she is supposed to be struggling with the upcoming Soft Opening; she is instead indulging herself having sex with 3 men. She says she is in love with all of them at the same time and cannot decide between them, but every encounter felt flat and with no sparks at all to me..	The book description made it look quite appealing, with the exotic location and the three hot men...but unfortunately it didn't reach not even the minimum expectations I had.
1,I barely settled in and this was over.  I couldn't even say it was a story, more like the intro to a book.  From the brief intro, I would say the characters would be likeable, but certainly underdeveloped.  The "story" was over at 32%, with a preview to a different book to buy.  Not impressed with this marketing style.
1,I normally don't write reviews on books I don't like, but with this one ... I had to make an exception.  The storyline and characters are okay, but there were so many problems with the whole book that it made reading it disruptive and irritating.  I will give examples:	Bread for the word Bred.  Your for the word you're. Their for the word They're. Breath for Breathe. Her for here.  It for is.  He for The.	Correct usage of tense was wrong.... Mention for Mentioned.  Appear for appeared. Toss for Tossed.	Then there were the inserted words that didn't belong.... "whittled Down the odds Down some" or "they would Have already Have..."	Sometimes there were words missing from sentences.	Commas:  I think the author threw commas everywhere he thought he could/should.  Made reading hard to follow.	There wasn't clear divisions from scenes with one set of characters to another scene with other characters.	I think I would have given this book more stars if it hadn't been so poorly proofed and printed without corrections.  The basic book (without all the errors) was a good light reading book.  I would only ask the author to PLEASE let someone proof his writing before printing it to be read by the public.  I would be more than glad to do this if he can't find anyone else.  At least nobody would then have to navigate through the mistakes.
1,I read the first book and loved it.  I do not mind the graphic sex as long as it has a reasonably good plot to go with it which the first one had.  This one is not a reasonably good plot so far.  I am half way through the book and 9/10s of it has been sex.
1,I just couldn't get into the characters.  They were superficial and not very interesting.  Didn't finish the book.
1,This book is very poorly written.  It has a lot of words spelled wrong and the characters in a couple of the stories become mixed up with each other and then a couple of pages later they revert back.  Some sentences don't make any sense.  Confusing at times.
1,A book about reptiles that does not identify any of the reptiles pictured! All generic information. I expected more information and more facts. There should have been, at minimum, a small note to identify each reptile pictured. When my daughter asks what she's looking, they expect me to just guess I suppose. I might as well just google reptiles and go from there. However, if you're just looking for a picture book, the photographs are beautiful. Aggravation aside, the dilemma with the books from this author is the information sources (credible? plagiarized?) and abrupt endings (no closing statements) in every book I've read so far. The one constant are the stellar photographs. Please note that I received this book at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased opinion, and I'm under no obligation to give a positive review if I don't think the product is good.
1,Unrealistic. There is no way the two would fall in love at first boink. No way the fallout from a public revelation like that would go so smooth. Also, there would be no forgiveness for the sister after what she pulled. Selfishly wrecking Avery's life over and over even with what Avery was sacrificing for her. No way.
1,I don't know what happened in the second half of the book but it became boring and tedious. Like the color just left the writing. Want to say more but the story just failed to hold my attention.
1,This is vague and unnecessarily wordy. You have to read to the end of some chapters to figure out what it was that the pointer entire chapter was about was supposed to be. I also found the number of links to other books distracting.	The typos were also distracting . As were the number of questions that weren't answered and seemed unrelated to the topic .
1,This book is terrible, the story is good, but whoever typed this book, kept repeating words,and lines and omitting pages. There was no way to follow the story
1,I JUST DON T GET IT.... WAS THAT THE BOOK? Where is the rest?, what happens next??? This was a wasted of time and space..
1,The quality of the narration was poor, and the narrator did not appeal to me
1,This story was almost to fairy-tellish. All the couple's were love at first or second sight. The intimacy between Gary and Angela was good. Kind of overkill with twins. I liked the way Angela dealt with Sara. Angela's parents coming back in the end was a bit much and kind of disappointing. Left me wondering why they didn't do better by Angela knowing the life she lived in foster care. The story was good, but could have been better.
1,No ending.  Too bad this author is not confident enough in her writing to sell books by virtue of their being worth purchasing.  Instead, she writes them with no ending so you can buy "Part Two" of their story under a different title, when Part One is incomplete.  Don't fall for it folks, her writing is not that good and you must like lots and lots and lots of sex.
1,Didn't care for the story at all. Was wanting to like it but it felt flat
1,interesting book, but does not add nothing interesting or different from others writters, except from the race, but there are so many "coincidences" of unrelated stories in the book that makes it like a 007 movie full of impossible actions.
1,Save your money... the cabbage soup diet recipe is FREE online all over the recipe sites, and the original one is even on Wikipedia.
1,I found the characters mildly interesting. It seemed she did not know how to end the book.	It makes me wonder how much pressure these authors who crank out multiple books just felt let down by ending and honestly will prob not order any more on this Sole regret ppl.		Signed,	Regretting my purchase on this one.
1,Some of the worst smut I have had the misfortune to waste my time reading. Just a rambling boring story that is mostly trash.
1,i like my books to have a smidge of reality. this  book was so out there,even i couldn't grasp the concept,[and i am gullible.] not to give away the plot[?] and honestly at some point you won't care . anyway the only person that would be interested in this pregnant ,free lance photographer ,traveling overseas alone ,would be a white slaver....maybe....Don't get me started on the ex-boyfriend babydaddy...uckkkk...this book is a stinker..the draw back on e-reading  is that you can't toss the book against the wall.
1,There was a good tale in this erotic short story by Lady Jennings but, in this case more than in every other work of hers I have read, the lack of pages is damning.		The problem are the three characters: at the beginning Fred is a country oaf, Vincent a dishonorable rake and Micah a wallpaper flower and they do not change throughout the story because they do not have time to. A whole middle section is lacking, a bunch of pages where the reader should have seen them falling in love and become friends.	This is why the words of love Vincent speaks towards the end and the dangerous initiative of Fred's that closes the story simply fall out of the blue.		As a side note I should mention that things are not entirely fluid in the extended sex scene. The characters find themselves repeatedly in positions that have not been properly introduced so that it takes quite a lot of musing to understand how they got there in the first place.		A revision could be in order.
1,I have no idea what the author wants to say in this book. I did not find the book vulgar or obscene, I just didn't get it.
1,I wish they would let people know that this was an erotica novellas. Not full stories just plots thrown together. The bonus stories are all the same, just different character names and plots. Not my cup of tea. I enjoy full-length novels with interacting characters. I would definitely NOT RECOMMEND if you are looking for more substance.
1,Good lord how negative can one get!  Geez, if I believed the writings in this book I'd off myself since he presents a hopeless future.
1,It was ok. Some parts were cheesy and it didn't emphasize spiritual warfare enough. I was expecting Frank Perreti but was disappointed.
1,All the fun that was Cameron from book 1 was ruined in this book. She became a vapid, shrill bitch for a good chunk and I wanted to slap some sense into her constantly. Plus I saw the "twist" on the bad guy coming a mile away.	I'm also noticing a disturbing editing issue with all the books in this series. On more than one occasion it appears scenes have been cut/edited out but following events/scenes don't seem to take this into account so the reader is left with a huge what the F%$^& am I missing feeling
1,It started in the third or fourth page (foul/filthy language). I could tell it would get worse, so I deleted it from my kindle -- do not care to read books with that type of language.
1,I am a big fan of romance novels. I like when the stories are believable, sorry this book just didn't do it for me. who would put their life on hold for a fiance who is presume dead? then after two years he pops up and your decision is, oh yes i'm so in love with you i'm going to called off my wedding...REALLY, I had to skip a number of chapters to get to the end. The story just didn't make any sense.
1,Once I start a book, I usually see it through but this selection was just not enjoyable for me. First the Captain and XO are apparently so good looking that even the Commander in charge of the investigation turns into a googly eyed, simpering teenager. The woman behind the trouble would never really be harassed because she is a troll. So the conclusion is only attractive women are ever harassed. And to top it all off the Captain is a knuckle dragging Neanderthal who thinks women belong in the kitchen barefoot and pregnant. Despite the fact that he seemingly treats his people like a blowhard, the staff respects him, even worship him for reasons that are never made clear. And if that wasn't enough, there are typos and mistakes like this sentence Congratulations! How does it feel to join all us married me?.
1,On, and on, and on, and on. Gets to be mind numbing after a while.
1,I know it was free..but come ON!  Weak, entitled, un-selfaware, immature, character with a 'gay' hair dresser friend? The dig pisses me off to no end! And that's just the first part of the book. I won't be looking for The rest whether it's free or not!
1,This is a quick read if you like something that is not serious...even a little bit silly.  The story is predictable.  Some grammar, punctuation , paragraph and sentence structure errors are distracting.
1,Poorly written, child like vocabulary.  Deleted all three books, after reading a few chapters of the first book.
1,Bad
1,50 pages does not make a book.  It makes a few chapters of a book that has been chopped into bits for the money.
1,the stories / characters are ok but the writing & format are a hot mess.  The author loses track of her character's names then changes from present to future tense then back to present & it gave me a headache to follow.  People having babies then back to still pregnant; characters advance in years then backtrack to fit another character's narrative.  Then 75% into the book; it starts over for the last 25% so doesn't even deliver on pages advertised.  Not worth money or time to read.
1,This book was terribly simplistic and riddled with grammatical errors and typos - it reads like a high school book report and if I were the teacher I would have given it a C-.		The wordiness of the book makes me wonder if the author had a certain word count to hit. For example:	"Yes for example this book has a cost. We tried to make it cheap and affordable but in the same time to give ourselves the means to help others in their journey. Always remember no one knows everything nor can they predict and plan for everything but starting from somewhere will help you on that path."		"You may not be a drinker but others will want a way to get their minds off of the times for a bit so having alcohol stocked up will be a good one and there are many uses for pure alcohol."		What?!!  Is this written by someone who learned English as a  second language, or simply never progressed beyond an 8th grade education? Is there any excuse for not running SPELL CHECK on a piece you are readying for publication?		Some of the information in the book is OK, a little simplistic, but valid - but there are so many better places to get that information, concisely and without all the word fluff surrounding the points this author wants to make.
1,I am giving this book one star because I am required to. The book was so horrible! Richard is stalker like in his pursuit of Rhonda. It was so poorly written it's unbelievable. Don't waste your time.
1,If you enjoy erotic fiction then this is the book for you. I couldn't even finish the book because of all the lewd words, extremely graphic sex scenes. All in all it was porn in a book.
1,I got a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.		After reading it, I can only say that I wasted my time. Girl finds love abroad and faces difficulties and doubts... That kind of story has been done to death, so I was kind of expecting a different twist to it, maybe a more complicated plot with unpredictable events, but I was sorely disappointed. It is not an original story and it is a pity, because I like a good love story, especially if it is set in a beautiful and romantic place as Italy.		Carly is an oboist who is obsessed with her job and her music. Nothing matters to her apart from getting gigs, gigs, and more gigs. Obviously, she is not happy for having to go to Italy (imagine that, how does the symphony dare to interfere with her plans?) and she spends sulking about it for a good 50% of the book. And then we have the handsome, mysterious, dark Italian tour guide who will make her tingle in all the right places (clich much?). So of course Michelangelo, who also has a secret plan of himself, will try to conquer the rude and distant American. All of this while Carly is on tour with the symphony, giving concerts around Italy, and stressing about her performance as a soloist with the diva opera singer (yeah, more clichs). The ending was totally predictable and way too convenient for every character.		Cliched and flat characters, unoriginal and uninteresting plot, no twists, no tension, and some editorial mistakes. I didn't enjoy reading this book.
1,I really tried to like this book cos it was such a different idea... .  The writing was quite good, characters were ok my biggest problem was the fact that I could not suspend my disbelief long enough... cos really you can hear your dogs thoughts.  And then if you could hear your dogs thoughts why the hell would you go around telling everyone.  Yeah no, not for me.
1,It had a point but it could've been free for what its worth. Save your $2.99 it tells you half the things you most likely already have tried.
1,Not my cup of tea
1,I have to say, I was disappointed because I thought I was downloading an entire book but all it was to it was a small portion of the book.  It ended and the reader was told to look for more or some nonsense like that.  Don't bother.  And too, the story line was not all that good so I can't say much more that I found it lacking.
1,This book is very similar to "The Hunger Games" trilogy.... Almost to an exact with similar sounding names, similar plots and the title is about fire just like, "Catching Fire." The name of the protagonist, Dana Ginery. has the same number of syllables of Katniss Everdeen. The person that Dana looks up to, Samson, has the same number of syllables of Haymitch.		The President of Dystopia (btw that name IMO is very lazy and who would blatantly choose the word that means unpleasant and bad as their new world... Especially since the President and leaders want to trick the citizens into thinking their new world is equal and fair and good??) wants to punish Dana for rebelling against him and airing a rebellious video... Uh, sound like "Catching Fire" anyone?		I think this book has some differences but essentially it's a rip-off of "The Hunger Games" and I personally don't condone such writing styles.		I wouldn't recommend this book. The author does have writing talent but this book is not something that should have been published.
1,Unfortunately second time around is not a charm. I will not be reading this author again. Took too long for a menage sex scene. Long and boring! sorry
1,Although I've enjoyed the author's other books, this one was very disappointing. The storyline was weak and forgettable, the characters immature.  The hero is a former SEAL, but there is absolutely nothing in his character that makes him seem like a SEAL, alpha male, or strong male lead.		I hated the fact that this book was written in first person--I felt like I was reading something written by a teenager.  It might as well have been a stand-alone novel for how little it tied in to the rest of the series.  More, Please was nothing like the author's other books in which the characters' stories were nicely woven together.  She did throw in mention of the other characters at the end, almost as an afterthought.  Unfortunately that did nothing to redeem this weak story.		After looking forward to this new release, I was very disappointed.
1,I am halfway through and don't know if I can finish. The "heroine" in the story is so nosy and pushy she really ticks me off. She has nothing to do with the crimes, yet shoves her way into the investigation, even going so far as to open a file on a cop's desk to snoop (isn't that a crime or something?). She finds out things during her "sleuthing" that she doesn't take to the cops but then tells every one she comes into contact with, everything she or the cops have found out. Then she has the nerve to tell others that "they shouldn't get involved". If I was a cop in that story, I'd arrest her for blowing the investigation. If I'm going to read a story or a series, then the heroine or hero can't raise my blood pressure from anger.
1,Well, who would have thought that marry old England was as morally bankrupt as current day Hollywood? I am flabbergasted. The House of Lords sounds  like Slick Willie's fraternity. I am shocked. Don't any of these publishers proofread? Too many grammatical errors.
1,This story about a dog finding his forever home (apparently inspired by the author's real life) is written for children.  Given the audience, the author writes very simply, but I wish he had struck a balance between writing at an age appropriate level and just writing simply and with small words.  This book will not be of interest to older children, but there are some concepts that might be a bit harder for younger children (the "angry people," the hungry guy who breaks into the house and just begins eating food).		Although I think it is great that there is a children's book with a focus on dog welfare out there, this needs a bit more work.
1,This is a ridiculous story. It begins reasonably well, but descends into unrealistic plot hijinks, in which the blockhead cousin is sent off to the villain's house to steal back the wagering wife's vowels and heirloom necklace from the slimy creep who won them. In the meantime, the two leads fall besottedly in love with one another in approximately 5 minutes. Right. Harper also fails to do her research and misuses several Regency terms, (as well as ignoring the social mores of the time), something that really disturbs me. Why set a book in the period if you're just going to ignore what society of the time was like? Using a few clothing terms and talking about Bonaparte and French spies doesn't make your book a Regency.
1,My major issues with this story are the yawn-inducing first third that provides neither depth of character nor of story; the total lack of stated or shown motivation (a reason isn't motivation) for the brutal attack by the husband on his wife until it is revealed via dialogue halfway through the attack ; and the contradictory actions of the husband during the attack.  The husband is repeatedly characterized as weak and sick, and thirty seconds later is engaged in strenuous physical activities.  He gleefully plucks out an eyeball but is too weak stomached to look at the optic nerve.  He reminisces about his love for his wife and tenderly strokes her hair while gouging a hole in her stomach.  Hello?  This is not a case of a remorseful husband, either; it is a case of a confused author. Nothing rings true. Nothing flows. I don't care about these people and I didn't care what happened because they didn't care themselves,  and the author apparently didn't either.  Skip this and read something by Sam West or Matt Shaw.
1,This Author is a favorite of mine but this book was not her best work. It was drawn out a the characters where weak and shallow.
1,could not get through the first chapter, the only reason it gets one star is so I could leave a review
1,For me this book started out promising possible "fated mates" who start out possibly not liking	each other,but things started to change once they got on the "Pleasure Cruise " , The Description	didn't say exactly what type of "Pleasure" it was..at least nothing hinted it was a floating sex club	where just about anything goes.. Well that wasn't really my thing but i was just gonna hum my  through	it and concentrate on the lead characters of Heath and Tonya , they seemed interesting two shifters/ppl	fighting their attraction to each other sure it's a lil been there done that but done well can still be really, really	fun ;) but for me it's not fun how one minute Heath is thinking Tonya is possibly his "fated mate" and wanting	to show her just how beautiful she is  and the next he's strapping both her arms and legs to the bed and getting	out nipple clamps to put on her.... NO Thanks, ok I personally am NOT big on sex toys in my books.. Ok that said	if their used in a romantic and loving way I can get into it..say a couple who have already been together a few times	and they both already Knew the other was into bondage and toys (just like they ALREADY were) or a sex club encounter	written in an interesting way,but everyone on the same page wanting adventurous sex... Not a Woman who was  conned into	coming into the situation with NOT A CLUE as to what she was getting into  and they guy she has a crush on and could be her	"fated mate" has to tie her up and put clamps on her before he's ever made love to her or done anything sexual to her except	kiss her a few times....for me it ended their,(deep sigh) that was soo horribly UNROMANTIC to me it felt almost hurtful, I suppose	I'll be an "odd man/woman out" on this but for me it was just wrong that the 1st real sexual encounter they have is her having both	her arms and legs cuffed to the bed and nipple clamps put on.. I'm sorry if this was the only way a guy could think to show me just	how "SEXY" and "Beautiful" he thinks I am I'd want him to THINK AGAIN and maybe find me another guy..especially it didn't feel like	she was 100% comfortable with all of it she was just going along because he made her panties wet,and while I'd love a hot guy wanting me! Well period this is just not for me, a couple of kisses to Hey let me strap you down, that's all about control thru sex,Not love or anything would think a "fated mate's"1st should be...	O' Well you know how it is you LOVE a book by an Author soo much you foolishly think your gonna love everything they do...	Wrong!	but I did LOVE Twin Alphas: Claimed (A BBW Werewolf Romance) by Georgette St. Clair	and I would Wholeheartedly recommend it...
1,This one not such stirring stuff- normally appreciate this author's books but maybe time for a new series? Or something.
1,I didn't think it was very realistic.  I finished the book reluctantly.
1,This book was a bit to wishy washy for me. It was like the same thing was said over and over again throughout the book. It started really good but towards the end it lost it for me. The ending was where it lost me. Over and over you hear it's my fault no its my fault don't blame yourself if only I hadn't said what I did. Zach beat himself up over what he said but I don't believe what he said was so horrible that she had the right to keep his son from him. I mean come on he didn't even get a real mad on with her. The son was so mad then so sick but in the hospital all is ok and he can't wait to go live in that big house? Wow he got over that fast and picked up on the whole dad thing. The ending was to sickly sweet for me, I love a good ending but this was just a way to finish the book. I just don't buy everything worked out so easy breeze after all that talk, and there was a LOT of talk. I got so tired of hearing who was to blame and all the if only. It was just ok, for anyone liking boring romance that are predictable this would be perfect for you, not so much for me.
1,Not something that I will be fallowing....
1,I love all of shays stuff. And I'm never disappointed. Buuuuuut,	 this one I am. I know I am in the minority here. But Dom and Sub story's leave me dry. I always feel bad that the H has to have the h subservient to him inorder to get it up or even to make it worth keeping her. And the h I just can never look up to and root for because I always feel like there is nothing to her.	That's why I liked Shay, cause the guy was alpha and the girl was strong without it. So this is not badly written. Shay still knows how to write a story. This one just was not my taste.
1,...it just didn't deliver. There was too much telling, not nearly enough experiencing. This also resulted in the story being much shorter than it should have been. I found myself regularly thinking, "Why wasn't this short blip of information included as an actual scene?" It made the whole book feel distant & rushed. I think I could've liked the characters, but I never got to really know them. And I wish I had.		Having just finished the book & the teaser for the next book about Everly's sister, the easiest example to provide crosses between both books - the second appears to share the same flaw. During the first book, we're given zero insight about a flourishing possible romance apart from a few vague hints. Then the second book dumps a bunch of information about the entire thing in the reader's lap...in the first chapter. So. Much. Information. But it's not interesting because it's like reading a dry text book. It could have been an exciting secondary plotline in the first book for the sequel to pick up. But no. The author simply informs the reader of pertinent details instead of weaving an intricate tapestry. The threads are nice, but the weaving is shoddy (like this metaphor).		The problem is rampant throughout this book. Everly's background is complex & should be explored, but it's not. Her mother deserves dialogue, at least as much as the step-mother got (& the step-mother wasn't at all believable). Ben's background apparently doesn't exist. None of the characters are fleshed out. The whole thing is two dimensional when it should be vivid 3D.		I'm giving it two stars because of the story potential & because I liked the cover. I highly recommend the author get together with some writer friends & revamp this book & its successors. It's a lovely idea that requires more attention & sharpened skills.
1,This book was supposed to be an erotic short story but it actually just made me really mad. I was upset about the main female lead's position, I didn't think it was fair that she was being taken advantage of, the way she was. But if your into crooked cops forcing ladies who aren't even breaking any laws, to have sex with him, then you will love this short read.
1,Boring overall, with way too much M.A.C. (Mutual admiration club). "Your great". "No YOUR Great". "Ok. But your greater". it was never ending.		The hero was a moron. He had to have everything explained to him. Everything. And then there were the inconsistent moments, when he suddenly was smart.		Spoiler alert: Add in a Deus ex Machina, where a god steps in and gives him all knowledge magic, in a single moment. And follow that up, with the fact that he still is an ineffectual wizard.		As for "the story". It was basically a milieu piece, including a common flaw of that type of story - the story lacked forward momentum.		Even though, I know that there are other books, in the series, and they are likely free on Amazon unlimited, I don't intend to read more from this author.		As well, it was all soft magic. I prefer hard magic systems.		I guess i will end on a positive note. .the story didn't really have anything that I consider to be too offensive. It wasn't overly bloody. Didn't have gratuitous sex. No body got raped, murdered, captured or betrayed. The characters were mostly honorable and likable.
1,This writer needs to spend some more time developing her characters,the go from not knowing each other to loving each in seconds. There no slow building of emotions. She writes as if she were a 10 year-old.. the plot and story line was not bad she just need to take her time. I put the book down in anger so many times but I'd already paid for it so decided to finish it as best I could. Will not be reading another book written by this author though.
1,Why in the world would T.K. Leigh make her hero an ex navy seal, who's totally incompetent?  This author needs to read some Suzanne Brockmann before even going into the navy seal world.		Honestly, I've never understood what bloggers meant when they say they felt like they were told the story.  That the author didn't let them feel and discover the story on their own.  I understand completely now!!!		I had no emotional attachment to this story, or stories (I read the trilogy).  I never even pictured the characters in my head.  The way the author writes, skipping all over with the point of view, I often didn't know who was taking or thinking.		It's obvious this author is Indy.  It's sad really because it makes me not want to try other Indy authors.  My favorite all time series was from an Indy author and this author tarnished those out there who are trying to make a mark.		There was far too much going on in these books, but all that could've made this story great was skipped over, all the suspense was thrown out for repetitive sex scenes.  Everything about the love story became repetitive and I really didn't care to read the ending.  I did, but stl felt nothing for it.  There was no racing heart, gripping book, turning pages for me AT ALL.		I guess I'm one of the few to say these books left me with no emotion.  I feel like I was told a cheap version of a terrible story.
1,What is the difference between a picture and a list of letters?  One is a picture, and one is not. Too easy, you say? Well, the author doesn't seem to know the difference.		The "pictures" in this book consist of four lists of alphabets in different font styles, with a couple of punctuation marks thrown in. The last item references repeated letters, but the five items included don't make any sense. Yuck!
1,tried sorry ...lost from the beginning not sure if I missed a book...I could not get into the story. did not make past chapter 3
1,Loving just about every story Beat to a Pulp publish on their site, I looked forward to this. I don't know why, Im not mad for Westerns, unless they feature Clint smoking a cheroot and casually pushing his poncho to the side ready to slug lead into a squinty-eyed nemesis.		I couldn't help picture a young Eastwood as this books hero, Cash Laramie, but unfortunately the book didn't live up to expectations.	It starts with a young Laramie saving an older woman from a bunch of male chauvinists, killing one and helping send the rest to prison. She then beds him, despite being a few years older than his fourteen years, before sending him on his way to see the world.	Years later they meet up again as Cash, now a US Marshal, is sent to protect her as she runs for mayor of a town in lieu of her murdered husband. Laramie meets up with her again as a couple of criminals are about to rape her, and the rest of the story is about him, with the help of his colleague, Miles, protecting her and her son from further attempts on their lives by the towns corrupt mayor.	Theres violence here to make your bones shake, with pieces of skull flying about, and eyes shot out, along with a rape scene that surprises. So youd think the book would have the same amount of grit as the shorts featured in Beat to a Pulp. Instead, it feels more like a Saturday afternoon, 50s version of the old west, despite its violence. Its dialogue is a little stilted, and quite a bit of the action doesn't convince. The characters feel under-developed, including its protagonist, and the ending has a character turn round his enmity almost in the time it takes to make a cup of tea.	Its not a horrible novel by any means, it just felt rushed, and told way too straight, with little to say about gender politics in the old west.
1,I really wanted to like this book but it is so incredibly bad that I just can't give it a good review. The editing is terrible, the grammar is awful, the punctuation is completely misplaced. And what man, a policeman at that, says "lovely"? The story is all over the place, with no real rhyme or reason. At least I only paid $.99 for this book. Maybe with some editing the star rating might be a 2, possibly a 3.
1,The book is badly written and unbelievable. It's about a crazy, dumb and shallow woman who got rid of her child because the dad didn't want her and she wanted to keep an apartment in Manhattan. Don't waste your time or money on this one.
1,Only the introduction and the last book were good. The thread of sabotage was the only consistent line in the story. The romance was ridiculous and the declarations of love we're not believable.
1,The first two stories in this book are very nice and lovely. Even the flawed beauty excerpt. But that last story is really pointless and stupid. It free so get it for the first 2 stories but don't buy this book.
1,Can't tell where this is going.  I hope it gets better later on.
1,Well where should I start ..... I finished reading Board Resolution and the wonder that someone could write such a combination of a nebulous teenage wet dream and the fantasies of every inadequate woman hater was overwhelming.		The premise that a woman who was as powerful and masterful in a male dominated world of high finance could be reduced to some trembling and sexually desperate slave was such a stretch for my human mind to begin with that I could hardly believe that the author would push me even farther into fantasy land with the thought that a bit of date rape combined with a most creative gang-bang which would be "just what she needed" just pushed me over the edge of any possibility to see this as anything more than literary porn written to appeal to men with inadequate equipment and women with severe mental problems.		I should pause for a moment to make sure you understand that I am not a fan of erotica (much less BDSM). The reason has nothing to do with the sex but much to do with the fact that almost all of it (with a few notable exceptions) is poorly written, has little if anything resembling a plot outside of writing about sex in various incarnations and generally reduces the characters to little more than what can be done in the erogenous areas between ones legs. The writings of Larissa Ione are more to my speed in this area since she weaves her erotic scenes into an overall plot that while including sex in various forms have an end game that includes more than an orgasm.		Back to the story at hand, our dual personality heroine Savannah, who apparently can run a billion dollar corporation but has the need to be date raped and treated like a piece of meat by Matthew Lord Kensington (ya gotta love that name) and brought to the pinnacle of self awareness by a gang-bang of sorts with his buddies. I know what you are thinking, "What a fantastic love story" < sarcasm/off> but somewhere along the way anything resembling reality checked out and it might as well have been Star Trek porn (and the actions of this version of "Scotty the engineer" are about as impossible as getting that extra bit of warp drive).		The HEA of this makes my head spin since I would have tasered his ass on about page 11 and end of story or if I let things play out in this nightmarish scenario, the next step should have been Savannah getting a sexy 40 caliber Glock and polishing these boys off this earth. Apparently, my naivety in the world of BDSM did not realize the proper reaction is to be grateful to the rapists and fall madly in love with one of them. Such is this story and since I don't have a number smaller than the national debt to measure the incredulity of this story all I can say is that it does have a "train wreck" appeal but any lasting compulsion to read it again would have me wondering if my secret desire is to become a serial rapist.
1,i love the beginnings of the plot developing but can't stomach the vapid dialogue and the whole damsel in distress thing. When authors make strong women characters i'll read everything they write but this insipid romance is not appealing at all. I had high hopes as i love the theme but can't get more than 1/3 way thru the book.
1,I don't often write reviews.  I don't like to write a negative review because I know the authors put so much of themselves into their work.  But I feel obligated because I wish someone would have saved me from attempting this book.		The characters act like they are 10 years old.  It's not cute. I tried overlooking this and read on.  Every now and then I would think that the relationship between the main characters was going to progress due to a kiss or some sign of affection, only to be disappointed.		I persisted until I got to 80% and gave up. I couldn't stand anymore of the childish antics and by this point, I really didn't care if the couple ever got together.		I am really confused as to how this book has such high ratings.  I read 5 - 7 books a week and always finish them, but just couldn't do it.
1,This is not a book I would recommend.  The teenage babysitter is seduced by the father of the kids she is watching, with very descriptive erotic scenes.  That's bad enough, but then the wife/mother gets involved in a "three way."  I don't intend to read any more books by this author...waste of money, if you buy it.  Waste of time if you borrow it.
1,liked this short story well enough but if I hadn't read the other short stories set in this arc of the series, I would not have as most elements of the tale were underdeveloped.		The heroine has rage issues which is interesting. The love story is underdone.		So, yeah, meh.
1,Note: I received this at a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased review.  Here's the deal.  I order this, with the foreknowledge that it was a preview/reference type book. It also advertises free coloring pages via a link in the ebook. The link did not work. Let me clarify, the link redirects you to an image of a a hand coloring and there is nothing else on the page.  Thankfully I got this for free, otherwise, a refund would be requested.
1,I found this book by searching "free kindle Christian fiction", about halfway through the book I had to start skipping pages because it was very sexually explicit.  I just wanted to let anyone else who might be looking for a non sexually explicit story, that this is not it.
1,Great characters and a touching story.  I think my brain just can't get over the more formal,  southern genteel way of speaking.
1,This is the worst book I have ever come across. Despite all the bad reviews I wanted to give it a try but I should have known better. Everything is told to you, there's hardly any dialogue and what little dialogue there is, feels like it was written by a child. This books makes me want to scream!
1,A totally predictable story line for anyone who has read any other Hamish Macbeth. I read the series for the scenery.
1,Her other books, The Berkeley Method & Director's Cut were pretty good. The 3rd, The Final Act was boring and a long, predictable way to get to the end. This one was unfortunately the worst. Painfully slowing and boring, could not finish.
1,Read until chapter 13. Haven't stopped reading a book, no matter how bad but this book just didn't draw me in. Plus the big thing is I've read Irish books and they have dialects! This book has nothing interesting like that, just plain English. The author needs to incorporate and research dialects if she is going to write books with characters from a different country.
1,Kind of dry.
1,Not my kind of read, tho I read the whole book.  Just not f2f or me but good if you like this k I nd of book.
1,I enjoyed this story.  However, why in the world do some authors insist on steamy sex scenes?  I cannot pass the book to anyone else.  Please keep writing without it.
1,Not as hot as the first tale but interesting and definitely hot. Hoping we get some details of the dragons in the other books.
1,The preview got me interested but the book never lived up to the premise. There will be some who like this but for me there is just too much cutsie coincidence and deliberate miscommunication between characters. And there are a lot of characters! Obviously, there will be more books - not that I want to read them, but some will. The sex scenes are written for women-who-want-to-read-about-men-having-sex, which means they are long, repetitive and verbose.
1,No ending to this book unless you purchase the next book! SQ
1,I found this book irritating and frustrating. I usually give these regency romances by recent authors some benefit of doubt vis a vis the insertion of modern sentiments but not when there is almost a complete lack of historical details. So calling this a historical novel is a stretch. The language is too modern for my taste. I don't expect authentic early 1800 writing of course, but it could be a bit more formal. Also the author is not using the correct salutation for dukes and duchesses, e.g. referring to the duke as Lord Grayson. The correct usage is easy to attain simply by Googling. There are also grammatical errors and typos (e. g. taught for taut).  Referring to the music for a waltz as a "song" is wrong. The story is practically plotless and many of the conversations drivel.		The heroine is supposed to be forward thinking but she comes across as rude and arrogant. She lives an idle life and the reader is constantly reminded that she lives only for herself. Also it is incomprehensible why she should take to wearing hand-me-downs from her sisters that she refuses to re-fit since she is supposed to be from a wealthy and prestigious family. All of her behavior seems to be geared towards making a statement rather than from a true independence of mind. It's ridiculous that she thinks her behavior makes her independent when she is the spoiled daughter of aristocrats. There are also many uses of the hero's tripping/falling to get her to fall into the arms of the hero -- too common a gimmick to be effective. The "scandal" that sent the heroine into the country is ridiculous (spilling soup into the lap of a marquess).		The hero is a bit more likable and reminds me of the Duke of Sale in "The foundling" by Georgette Heyer but much more underdeveloped.		All in all, I will not be reading other books from this author unless she improves her writing and historical accuracy.
1,While I liked the characters, and some of their interaction, I wish the author had researched the period more, or made it clearer that this was an "alternate earth" of the "medievalesque" times.		There was just too much inconsistency in the "world building" which felt sloppy. Adalira's father is a Prince and yet he spent little time at Court?The two lead characters lived within less than a day's ride of each other and yet had never heard of each other? Castles in the medieval countryside close enough to have "a season"?  Bastian considering himself ugly because of some battle scars? Adalira riding out with no one but her companion to another house without asking permission (or at least letting her parents know?) Tea parties? Nope. Either it's an entirely different world, or it's medieval England and the writing should be consistent about the setting.		On the other hand, the main characters, Bastian and Adalira, have some nicely drawn qualities. The secondary characters, their friends and family are also well defined and individual, but could also have been fleshed out without dragging the plot around. (For instance, the writing in the letters between the two could have been summarized or edited.)		Sad, because it had so much potential.
1,I really liked Maxwell at the beginning of this series but by this 4th book I was totally disappointed. His rescue of Patience drug on and on and then came to such an abrupt end it made me mad. It was such a blatant way to suck more money from the reader that this author lost me totally. I no longer care what happens to any of these characters. Dont waste your time nor money.
1,I was really looking for something to scare my pants off and this was not it. I made it to the fourth story and deleted it. While the first story was pretty good, the next three I read were not so good.
1,The synopsis sounded promising,but  when I started to read this story I was  sorry I spent the money. The dialogue was stilted, the author kept  jumping from  a first  person to  a third person narrative which was very confusing. There  were grammatical  errors  , and at times she'd use  phrases that didn't make sense. Save Your money . I wish I had.
1,I liked the first book, "Either Side of Midnight" enough to want to read the sequel. It was a good story, but it ended in a cliffhanger! AND apparently there is no sequel in sight!		I won't waste my time on anything this author writes ever again! Stories that don't end aren't stories! They're simply gimmicks to part readers from their money!
1,I enjoyed it, it's a cute story. I think once the writers mature a little more they will be successful in the young adult genre.
1,Story is as you would imagine. No surprises.
1,The only reason I am giving this book a 2 stars because I really do love the males characters of this series, their are so amazing in their own ways, love the friendship and the bond of brotherhood and how protected they are of each others, loved the banter between them, I caught myself to many times, laughing out loud..Ms. Oliver does have a good sense of humor...	The main storyline of this book is about Clutch and Taylor..1st, let me start with Taylor, this character is what I call woman/child, she 18 years old, still in high school and living with mom and dad, very immature young lady..Since she was a kid, she always had a thing for Clutch..Now Clutch is what I call a gentle giant, good head on his shoulder, run his own successful business, loyal to a fault, a big brother that every one should has..Ms. Tess Oliver, never mentioned how old Clutch is, but I figured that he was over 21 or the twenty years range, he was very mature for his age and I really loved this character...So no matter how Ms. Oliver try to write a love story or romanticize, Clutch and Taylor love story, I just couldn't see it..All I saw in Taylor was an immature 18 years old child, sometime I saw this character in mom dress and shoes playing grow up, every time I read when Clutch and Taylor were holding hands, all I saw was Clutch holding hands with a 6 years old and about to wipe her nose..As I was reading the book I keep waiting for Taylor to do one of her immature move, she was famous for those kinda moves and Ms. Oliver didn't fail me and WOW and again, what the hell did Clutch see in this girl, I just didn't get it..If Ms. Oliver would had wrote Taylor finishing high school and going away to school and finally GROWING UP or at least part of the way, then come back as a mature young woman and the same level of maturity of Clutch, it would had been better as 2nd change of love..They was no common sense to this whole storyline between Clutch and Taylor, for me it was an epic fail..Now to be fair to Ms. Oliver, I did like the 1st book of this series and I have a feeling I'm going to like the 3rd one as well, at least the another women in the series are more or less the same age as the men and most important mature..
1,I honestly could ot get through this book. Too many spelling errors and the story line is not solid. It has potential, of it was edited at least.
1,Didnt lije
1,This book did not live up to the hype.  The first book in this series was better.  I found the romance to be rushed as well as the conclusion.  Ms Knowles can do better.  I am hoping that the final installment will tie everything together.  I really wanted to love it, but didn't.  I just expected more!
1,premise as old as time- innocent girl, a hardened man. Characters,plot and direction of the story could use a lot more development as well as an editor. For example, more time could have been spent describing the characters pasts, developing their relationship. The suspense and fear factor could have been more pronounced during the "she's being threatened by an old nemesis scene." If as much descriptive license was given to the characters and plot as the sex scenes this book would have been twice the length and ten times more appealing. sex scenes were hot but repetitive. Some made me cringe then say Wow. A wierd but great attribute of this book.
1,This is exactly the kind of story my husband always accuses me of reading when I'm not, I prefer something with a little more substance.	The story was better suited for a full length novel, but it was clear what the intentions were here.	Read it if it's still free for Kindle.
1,Concealed Power was part of an 11 book collect of fantasy authors. I didn't care for this one. I made it into chapter 24 of the 36 in book 1.	We are introduced to the main character when she is young, and she ages as the book progresses--but her voice, the things she thinks, and the way she says them never changes. She doesn't feel like she has grown up at all. To make matters worse, I found her annoying. She would whine about following orders and being lied to in one moment--bad, angry, thoughts of killing someone: then in the very next paragraph, 'Oh, but they love me and they know what's best, I'll be the good girl.' Maybe in the beginning I could see a young girl feeling this way, but chapter after chapter got on my nerves.	I never did figure out the political conflict. Too many groups and they were all south or north, and fighting and blackmailing but I couldn't keep who was who straight--and so didn't care.	While I didn't find many spelling type errors, there were a few times when either the sentence was constructed awkwardly or out of order. EX. "I put my mouth over my hands." Instead of hands over mouth. They were few but enough to pull be out of the story to re-read the sentence a few times to figure out what it meant.	***Spoiler Alert***	The final straw was to learn that girl was  a healer--healers are only women and can only heal men by sleeping with them. That can start at any age if the girls are kidnaped, or at the latest at 15 (no option to not participate) if they are registered with the government. Ick--yuck. The book was clean, but the idea was disturbing.	Again, I didn't finish the book so maybe she found a way to be a healer without the sex. I didn't want to wait around to find out she didn't, thought. No thank you.
1,Deadly R&R started out promising but the characters took a slow downward dive into being annoying. The plot started out like it contained a really good mystery but would take a backseat repeatedly to things that did not enhance the plot. Made me feel  as if I were reading a contemporary romance about a nice girl without any convictions and who relies too much on daddy.		I agree with another reviewer that the book lacked some focus. The writer did not do a good job with balancing the mystery and the romance. So both for me were rather lackluster. The romance felt more like puppy love.  The characters lacked focus too. They started out strong and independent but then became weak and ineffectual.  There were some parts were I desperately wished she would grow a spine and not rely on others. Shay and Tommy never seemed to progress with the book.		For the first quarter of this book I was really into it and looking forward to the mystery. By midway point I was basically wondering where was all the mystery-got kind of dull. By 75% of the story I just did not care what happened to the characters and started to skim the book to say I finished.  Maybe not a bad book for others but unfortunately I did not care for it.
1,SUMMER GIRL by Sophie Hill.		Some of the conflicts are described in Spoilers below.  If those don't bother you then you might like the book.  She's had a crush on him for years.  All of a sudden he notices her and they fall deeply and madly in love.  They are each dealing with different secrets from the past.  She wanting to uncover something.  He is still suffering from his.		One thing that bothered me.  Slade was sleeping with different girls every night for years, never wanting a relationship.  All of a sudden he spends a couple days with Heather and says "she was the best thing to ever happen to him."  I thought how?  Why?  I didn't see her doing anything different from other girls.  I wanted to see more support for that.		CAUTION SPOILERS:	Slade breaks up with Heather because he believed a lie.  Heather is grieving. The next day Slade believes the truth and calls Heather many times, but she won't answer her phone.  Her reason?  She didn't want "to let him get her hopes up and break her heart all over again."  That did not make sense.		Heather breaks up with Slade because she assumes something inaccurate, and she won't even discuss it with Slade.  Again Slade called her many times but she wouldn't answer the phone.  She even threw her phone away because she was afraid he would keep calling.		Slade shows up and tells Heather he wants to help her with something.  Heather lies and tells him she doesn't want his help.  She says if he doesn't go away she'll call the police.  That did not fit motivations.  It annoyed me.	END SPOILERS.		DATA:	Narrative mode: alternating 1st person Heather and Slade.  Kindle count length: 2,587 (342 KB) 191 pages.  Swearing language: strong including religious swear words.  Sexual language: strong.  Number of sex scenes: 3.  Setting: current day North Carolina.  Copyright: 2013.  Genre: contemporary romance.
1,I love this series. For some reason Steels and Vans stories were disappointing. Not much actionVan just going on and and about his family, they belonged to him. He  was beginning to sound like a stalker and a complete control freak.
1,Star Raider is about a thief who steals two priceless artifacts from a very wealthy man. When she sees the man abusing his ten-year-old daughter, she steals the kid, too. This is the basic plot. A plot with more holes that a screen door on a submarine.		At one point, after being pursued by the police, the thief, Cassie, says to herself, "I've got to get to the bottom of this conspiracy". She later finds out that there is a 60,000 'cred' bounty on her... and she can't figure out why. Even later, Cassie says to herself, "I have to start figuring out what this is all about". This is after she's gone to three planets and she's still being chased by bounty hunters.		Let me tell you, Cassie is CLUELESS. That's what it is all about! She's a thief who has stolen two priceless artifacts and kidnapped the daughter drom a wealthy man. Does she really think he's going to just let it slide?		Despite the fact that there's something up with one of the artifacts, some mystery to solve. This gal is too stupid to live. The girl, Lark, and the AI, Roger, are the most appealing characters in this book. I kept hoping that Cassie would bite the dust.		I made it through 60% of the book before I'd had enough of this waste of words. A criminal who is too stupid to understand that her victim might possibly want his property and daughter returned to him? A criminal who believes it's her right to steal from someone with impunity, not to mention all the poor folks who she's killed and injured in her attempt to get away... Yeah, I've had enough.		If you really want to waste your time and money on this farcical tale, be my guest.
1,Don't do it.  I thought I would give it another try but why?  It was an epic failure, enough said.
1,This book horrible, not a learning book or how to. This book was more of a kids inspirational book.
1,The story COULD be good, but it isn't. Adam is closed off, won't let Elea into his life, even though there's stuff going on that REALLY concerns her. Elea is successful on her own, yet she'll throw caution to the wind for Adam, even knowing something isn't right with their relationship. She gets threatened and attacked because of him, yet doesn't tell him until she's almost forced to.		Characters are one-dimensional. There's no back story to their lives. You'll have to purchase 3 more volumes to come to the end of their story.		This book DOES end on a cliffhanger, which it doesn't specify. You need to have money to purchase the next 3 volumes. Lame.
1,1. The missing punctuations really made reading this book incredibly difficult.  I don't know what the authors point in not using any quotation marks were, but whatever he was trying to do, he failed.		2. There are way too many details missing from the story.  For example: Tasneem survives while everyone dies the treatment. No explanation given on how or why she lived.  A revolution happened,  and the only mention of it is that it failed but succeeded in its goal.  There is no real mention of the relation of time from one story to the next.		3. Character development is weak.  You don't really get to know any if the characters in depth in this novel.  New characters are introduced for the sake of describing some event, but they are never to be seen again.  I suppose that Tasneem is the main character,  but even her appearance in the book is quite brief.		I read through the whole book because I thought that it had some potential, but it just continued to disappoint.		There where some nice touches in the book though.  While you didn't get to know many of the characters, the story of Micah was solid.  I was able to resonate with what he was going through,  and the story really did a good job of building his character so you feel like you got to know him.  This book needed a lot more of this.		For what it is, this book is way too short.  There seems to be too much story, which had potential, but was lacking because there was not enough space to give details and descriptions.		What I do hope is that Jason Gurley would go back, spend the time to really flesh out the characters and story making the people and events of this book matter to the reader.  That is a book that would be worth reading.
1,I like Toye Lawson Brown books but was really disappointed by this book. The story and characters were weak.
1,Poorly written and unbelievably trite.  This was a free book and I still feel like I overpaid. Don't waste your time.
1,If the premise of the story had been good I could have been more forgiving of the other issues but stilted language, many typos and  a weak story and characters combined into a completely forgettable book. Don't waste your time reading it.
1,*Note: review is a little spoilerish*	I was drawn to this book because its a BatB retelling. BatB is my favourite fairy tale and Im usually eager to read any retellings that I can get my hands on. On the one hand, this is a positive thing for The Subtle Beauty as it led me to purchase the book. On the other hand, however, it is not at all in its favour as it means that Ive got a lot to compare it with.		When held up against the likes of Juliet Marilliers Heart's Blood and Stacey Jays Of Beast and Beauty Im afraid that this book falls flat. Its certainly got some good ideas, with the story based on a form of Celtic mythology, but it still feels very unpolished. For one, the prologue takes up a whole 25% of the story. Its incredibly long and I personally found it boring as I didn't want to get caught up in that particular character.		At this point questions are already starting to crop up that don't get resolved: why would Xander go to the warlock for help then immediately threaten him? Why do the men suddenly decide to invade Xanders keep and threaten his wife? Why introduce the mythological creatures? After all, they have no particular role in the story beyond simply existing and could easily have been written out of it entirely. How does Xander manage to shake off the influence of the sword? Its like a drug, fundamentally changing him, but he somehow goes from being dependant on the blade to just not  How? Where did that come from? These are just the first of many unanswered questions that pile up throughout the story culminating in what happened to Xander? It goes from him being King of his realm to Eoghan being King with no mention of Xanders fate. I get the feeling that the author was still too caught up in the story in her head and forgot that the reader doesnt have access to all her knowledge.		Furthermore, the style is still a bit on the basic side. It often felt like I was reading a list of actions rather than a narrative. For example: Rhun slowed, no longer sure of his footing. Xander swatted a mosquito nuzzling the vein in his neck. Rhun nickered warily. Xander patted his shoulder to reassure him.		There was a tendency to over exaggerate each character as well. This storys Beauty is one of seven royal sisters, with each sister representing one of the seven deadly sins. The portrayal of each sisters sin felt somewhat over the top, though, and it just served to place another wedge between me and the story.		Beautys sin is pride, meaning shes very vain and convinced the sun worships her. It certainly made for a unique spin on the age old fairy tale but it also meant that Beautys personality repulsed me. When Im reading a book, I need to be able to connect with the main character on some level. That wasn't the case here. I couldn't understand why Eoghan, who is cursed for his fathers sins, caught in the body of a gryphon, would be interested in this vain creature, why he would keep making overtures, giving her yet another chance, given the way she treated him. I admire the authors guts, choosing to make her character so unlikeable but, for me, the story didn't have that flair that would have allowed it to carry off such a feat.		As a final note, theres some Gallic used in the story with a numbered reference that shows the translation in English on the last page of the Kindle edition. While a good idea in essence, its not really very practical. Im not going to faff about flicking to the back of the book for a translation each time; its not something I enjoy doing on the Kindle. In the end, I ignored all the contributions in Gallic. It might have been a better idea to include English repetitions of the Gallic terms, certainly in a digitally published novel.
1,Of course Damien and Nikki are beautiful and love each other, but this book was a waste of time and money.  This should have been the epilogue to the last book...It would have meant SO much more witht that book than in this stand alone version 94 pages.  It just seemed to syrupy sweet separated from the last book.  It would have been better to leave the trilogy where it was and let us all imagine their happily ever after.		Love, Love, Loved the rest of the series.  JK did us and herself an injustice with this addition.  Sorry...
1,Doesn't work at comic book or story book. Dumb at every level. Read it to see if this author did better than the Orangey fish debacle. Sadly, he doesn't. Don't think any child would sit still through this book. Glad it was free.
1,This book presents a very dogmatic approach to buddhism that is very steeped in the Asian tradition that the author was trained in. I have trouble translating this teaching into something that I can use in my western life.
1,Lots of editing problems which made it annoying to read otherwise I would of given it three stars
1,Well written interesting but really can't fairly rate because it's a come on tease...... Not a book review. Stop with number of words needed
1,It was ok out of all Fikes book it's my least favorite . Don't get me wrong . it's enjoyable but it just takes way to long to get to where I would have liked the story to go.
1,When I first saw this title, I honestly wanted to like the book.  While the theme is a familiar one present in quite a number of ebooks, I find that I often gain new insights by looking through a new set of eyes.  That said, this particular work falls victim to that all too common bugaboo of electronic publishing, appalling editorial standards.  Before I had finished chapter one, I resolved to cut my losses (after skipping somewhat ahead to see if the problem took care of itself).  Words have meaning; grammar and syntax perform important functions, and when these things are mangled or neglected, the work suffers.  Don't get me wrong, it is child's play to find any number of ebooks with worse editing and not a tenth of the narrative strength in this novel, but that doesn't excuse the problems that are present here.
1,Rachel Donnelly is a new author who clearly has a lot of potential.  However, she has yet to truly learn that words have power, and incorrectly-used words can prove disastrous to the mood of a story.		Poor grammar and sentence structure rendered the first few chapters difficult to read, but things went really wonky a few chapters in when our heroine, Kay, traveled to France to visit her grandmother.  Kay shows her mettle in being brave enough to enter a chateau suffering from "white shudders."  One cannot help wondering if this condition will prove to be contagious, and if all structures in the region will soon be trembling on their foundations.		Completely ignoring the ongoing tremors beneath her feet, Grandmere arranges for Kay to attend a masked ball.  There, Kay encounters at least two men with "well-formed physics."  Indeed.  Well.  That certainly provokes a mental image that is best not described.		To paraphrase Inigo Montoya, I ask the author, "Why do you keep using that word? I do not think it means what you think it means."		I threw in the towel when, later in the book, our Kay (while apparently channeling Humphrey Bogart) tells the Hot Guy that "..I shall always cherish Venice the most."		They had been in Vienna.		Ms. Donnelly - you do have talent.  I really liked your premise for the story. I liked the characters.  But please - please - find yourself a professional editor.  Thank you.
1,Became cluttered with too many distractions.  Too many side plots and people.  Frustrating trying to jump from one scenario to another that the main characters became a minor subplot.  Basically the H s daughter is to fall in love with the fathers friend who was in love with the daughters companion some 11years earlier when the friend and the companion got caught eloping..... were separated and ruined. All this is to happen while the father and companion fall in love while excavating a discovered Roman ruin on his property with two mischievous boys from the village.  And throw in multiple neighbors with a dastardly cousin who is seducing the daughter who is falling in love with this villain while she is falling in love with the fathers friend.  Oh and the friend proposes marriage again to the companion while becoming attracted to his friends daughter.  Top all that off with other intrigues, accidents, and witty challenging banter, plus teenage angst in love with anything in pants.........returned the book.
1,I was surprised by all the five star reviews quite honestly. I made it to page 52 before I couldn't take the perfection that was this woman a second longer. (And yet her name escapes me...)	Let me give you a brief synopsis: woman has unsatisfying job and boyfriend- gets rid of both. Flies off to NYC, ends up in Manhattan with engaged BFF and wealthy fianc.	It was the chauffeured black car for interview to her dream job, it was the instantly getting said dream job and starting that day, it was the oh so perfect black dress that someone else bought that somehow flattered her perfect figure further- it was all of that pure poorly written drizzle that made me want to retch.		Maybe I just need a pair of horrifically expensive red shoes to make my life as perfect... I'll just call the chauffeur.		Latent note: I gave it two stars only because I didn't want to be too mean.
1,This could be such an excellent series but the writer gets lost in her plot. Again the ending is abrupt and of course there is method in her madness she wants us to keep purchasing books.	No more I enjoy steamy novels but this one had me skipping pages, the angst was like pulling taffy enough is enough. The bones of the story is really good and I just wish she would have found her way. 2.5 Stars from me but read it for yourself and make up your own mind!
1,I am so tired of buying a book to find out it's only half of a story. There was no warning in the description that this is part one of a series. Now I'm expected to buy another book and wait a month if I want to find out how the story ends. Even then there's no guarantee it won't end in another cliffhanger. Come on! That's just RUDE! This new trend is a total rip off.
1,Overall, this book is not horrible. The author has a tendency to ramble. The descriptions are tedious at best. I spent much of the book skipping pages and trying to figure out why half  of the words were not relevant to the story.  Story line was good....the premise was solid. However, at one point, the h says her first name, introduces herself with her last. But somehow, the H doesn't notice or question. Made his anger rather irrational.
1,I chose this book because of the great synopsis and the 5 star reviews.	If the book was even half as well-written as it's synopsis this would have been a fantastic read.		I think the readers who gave this book 5 stars maybe read a different book than I did because I didn't think it was that great.		the character development was severely lacking, Chance didn't strike me as much of an alpha and if there was any romance, I couldn't find it. there was a little sexual chemistry and a few emotionally detached sex scenes but they seemed out of place to me.	this story could really use a good editor, I	 think maybe it was translated into English and possibly something was lost in translation. Also, there were lots of grammatical errors and typos.	I really liked the story line and I feel that with some tweaking, this could be a great book.		 I'm glad I didn't pay $$$ to read this book !!
1,too convoluted for me---I felt no connection to any of the characters and had trouble keeping up with them as they had multiple names. this was a difficult book to negotiate!!
1,This book was supposed to be a romance and humorous.  I laughed just once at the Clue style telling of how h got pregnant.	The H is easily manipulated by his ex.  The family dynamics are a mess. The complication between H and h was so predictable I found myself talking to my Kindle.	The story drags a bit and I had to force myself to finish.  I hate leaving a book unread once I've started.	This one needs a thorough edit.  There are grammatical mistakes, and the punctuation is terrible.	This author goes on my list of authors not to repeat.
1,Shareef I did not like the ending to this story at all...Tyce played Dallas for a ex cracked cheating skank. Tyce full of it he was mad at Dallas for lying about a pregnancy in book 1and 2, but it was ok for Angelique to screw and get pregnant by someone else. Hypocrite....I look forward to Dallas book, far as anymore Tyce series....I'm done. Dallas matured tremendously in this book, and Tyce still caught up on Angelique crackhead self. For the life of me I can't see how tyce was mad at Dallas for lying, but Angelique lied about doing drugs and was PREGNANT by another man. I hope Dallas finds her someone for her, and Tyce choice backfires in his face.
1,This story had the potential to be a wonderful story.		SPOILER!  SPOILER!  SPOILER!		1. Not enough description of the village or its residents for me to visualize what it looks like.		2. Zero chemistry between the trio.  Again, not enough description to convey what they each thought or felt.	As bakers you would think they were more in tuned to people's emotions.		3.  They boys didn't even court or woo her, didn't care about her feelings or the fact she never had anal sex.  They just jumped right in. Zero romance.		4.  The storytelling was choppy in some places and the storyline felt rushed.	Author really needs to develop her characters personalities and thoughts, write more emotional interaction between characters, describe the village in more details so that we can visualize what it looks like and end the story with an actual wedding in detail not just this is the dress and the end.		I know my review is harsh, but I see so much  potential in this author and would love for her to succeed.
1,When I first started reading romance as a wee little lass, my favorite authors to read were Beatrice Small and Victoria Holt. They wrote the naughtiest slave girl being sexually mastered by the sheik or desert ruler tales I've read. Well, Small was more on the erotic side, while Holt was a lot more subtle. When I saw Kitty Thomas had written her own spin on the sex slave girl being owned by a king of some alternate land where the general population is very open with their sexuality, much like the disturbing movie cult classic, Caligula, I decided to give The King's Pleasure a read. Kitty is known for writing dark and disturbing erotic but The King's Pleasure seemed more on the lighter side for me, even though Kitty does make a mention that The King's Pleasure is one of the "dirtiest" stories she'd written.		The King's Pleasure is a 34 page short story set in the kingdom of Himeros. Abigail is a poor half-gypsy who sneaks into the newly crowned king's castle to steal bread for her starving family. Abigail is caught by the king's guard and is about to have her hand cut off when Niall, the king is woken up. He finds this punishment to be too cruel and since he is a more compassionate ruler than his father was, he stops the punishment. Since Niall hasn't created his own harem of women to satisfy him sexually as is expected, he'll keep Abigail as his own one woman harem. Abigail is frightened because she was never taught to pleasure men like most of the gypsy women of Himeros have been. She doesn't understand why the king would be interested in a half-breed gypsy girl like her. But when Niall treats her kindly and makes certain her family is well taken care of, she sacrifices herself and welcomes his tutelage in the arts of sex, lovemaking and other sexual desires and positions.		Since Himeros is very open and accepting of sex, and in public. Niall has many festivals where men and women enjoy each other. Niall doesn't keep Abigail sequestered away in his bedroom for his own pleasure, but is very open in acting on his desire for her. He allows his trusted officials and friends to enjoy Abigail while he watches, but only he has the ultimate say and ownership over Abigail.		Abigail is now more open with her sexuality thanks to Niall, even with his sharing. Half way through I was enjoying this sexy tale, although I would have liked more scenes of bedroom play between the king and his innocent thinking slave girl. But then during a Roman orgy type sex party, something described stopped me in my tracks and icked me out. As a reader, I'm very open to most sexual acts described in erotic romance. I can handle BDSM, multiple partners, instruments stuck in places in a person's body that has no right being inserted, but when bestiality is added into the mix, that's where I say, no thank you.		The King's Pleasure has a mention of doggy love, and not the type where man's best friend plays fetch or even snuggles up to his/her owner. It seems here, that man's best friend is a woman's best friend thanks to what a dog's tongue can do for a woman in a not so pleasant and shocking way that really doesn't fit, but just adds to the sensationalism of the story.		I realize there's an audience for everything, even humans who have sex with animals in fiction, but I'm not that open or that understanding as a reader. I see no such reason for Kitty to add this description, even one mentioned in passing. It's one thing for humans to engage in shocking and disturbing the sex acts because it's consensual. Even if an animal like a dog, horse, or sheep may seem to be enjoying themselves based on what the author's describes such as in The King's Pleasure, it still leaves a bad taste in my mouth.		After reading that section, I found I couldn't continue, so I ended up DNFing The King's Pleasure and looked for something more innocent in the hopes to bleach my eyes by what I read. Such a shame, because I do feel Kitty has a skill as a writer of erotica, but perhaps it's best if she leaves the bestiality out of her work.		Final Grade: If there was no bestiality, I would have given this a C. The King's Pleasure was just too short and at times seemed rushed with the action and interaction with Niall and Abigail. Also I felt the price of $2.99 was too high for a 34 page story. Better to be priced at. 99 cents.		Katiebabs
1,Did not finish. Awkward writing style, no real back story for either character, too many themes jumbled together without a clear DIRECTION. And to be honest, some of the worst described sex scenes I've ever read. Both characters seem very one-dimensional, but especially Aura. Sad, I was looking forward to a good alien romance.
1,This book covers a grain free diet and an anti-inflammatory diet for weight loss.  Starting off, there are no reasons why a grain free diet or following an anti-inflammatory diet would help anyone lose weight.  If you are already eating a healthy diet and switch to one of these you aren't necessarily going to lose weight.  Conversely, if you eat mostly processed foods and junk and switch to even a reasonable diet you will probably lose weight.  Unless you have a reason to cut grains from your diet doing so isn't really going to help you that much.  Eating an anti-inflammatory diet may help you if you have that problem but the author provides no supporting evidence of why they are qualified to offer the diet and make the claims that they do.		Really, the only points to take from this book are to eat healthy, drink water, and exercise.  I received this book free in exchange for an honest review.
1,Not my cup of tea.
1,Rating: 2 stars		Arrrrggghhhh- I'm so mad right now. Not mad at the author or the book, but at myself. I feel like there's something wrong with me! I love love LOVE CM Stunich. I have yet to be disappointed, and yet, I feel somewhat let down after reading this story. I adore YA books too- they take me back to my younger days, in high school when everything was easy and my biggest worry was which boy I thought I liked more. 		In San Alplastar it is a yearly tradition for kids between the ages of 13-18 to participate in 'The Arrangement' where titles are rewarded to certain teens after voting, sort of like voting for homecoming king/queen, in a way. The main character in the story, Chloe Summers, decided to sit this years festivities out but is chosen as the Crush anyway. Having no idea how her signature was forged on the form and how she earned this title, the adventure unfolds and many mysteries remain, the most important being: who killed last years Crush, Tatiana? 		So there are several roles that are filled each year for this Arrangement. It doesn't last all year, just during the summer months and after it is over, everything is SUPPOSED to go back to normal. Chloe meets a guy whom she eventually falls for named Casper after he saves her from drowning in the beginning of the story. Casper's sister, Julie, is terminally ill and picked for the Outcast role during the Arrangement period. The Outcast deals with many hardships throughout this time, including: cruelty, hate, vandalism, harassment, and so on. Why do the townspeople and the police turn their backs away to this behavior? All because of some stupid tradition? Or is there more to it than that?		I really tried to get into this story but often times felt so confused. Maybe part of the reason was because I couldn't connect myself to the characters well enough and didn't pay attention to the extent I normally would. I found myself putting my Kindle down a lot! When I read CM's books I hardly EVER walk away- so this really came as a shock to me. I can't blame it on the author because I know how amazingly talented she is- I blame myself. This book just wasn't for me. I confirmed this after reading many wonderful reviews online. I don't want to sway any other potential readers opinions here, but an honest review is what I'm asked for so that's what I give.
1,I am one of those OCD people who can't start another book until the one I'm reading is finished, no matter how horrible it is.  This book cured me of my disorder. Thank you!!!
1,i could not get through this book, which is a rarity for me. i'm not even sure how far i have read, but i've not even come close to any part described in the posted summary. the book begins with characters who apparently have nothing to do with the alleged main character or the supposed plot. i understand the author prefers fast-pacing with a lot of action, but when unusual things are introduced, they need to be explained at least a little bit. there were too many details that left me hanging, wondering what the heck they were and why the heck they were relevant. which derailed my immersion in the story (which was already tenuous). there were also inexplicable contradictions in several of the characters. also, for a fantasy medieval setting, i just could not wrap my mind around characters walking around drinking coffee OUT OF PAPER CUPS, a'la starbucks. the book has potential. my advice to the author - do a lot more and more widespread reading in your chosen genre, and remember that your readers do not know the details that you do.
1,For a first book in a series, there's little background to understand the main character.  The grammar throughout the book was awful. "Ain't" was a favorite word.  Someone who supposedly grew up with a father who was a teacher would know better.  Waste of time.
1,I liked the thread of the story line, liked the skill set and history elements but the story simply degraded into a soft porn story. Literally pages of sexual interaction interposed with small bit of actual story - I love a bit of sex with appropriate development and lead up but this story was simply over the top. I only stayed with it because the pretense/plot was interesting
1,If you like 3/4 of your book to be explicit sexual content then you'll like the Return series.  Shallow story line and character development.
1,Several 4 star reviews said it was an easy read. This is true but,the word that jumped to my mind was juvenile. It impressed me as being written by a 15 year old.
1,A "unique" plot? Not so much. I have no idea what book the other reviewer read, but it can't have been this one.		The plot is ... so full of holes that a Supercarrier with its accompanying Battle Group and entire Air Wing on long range CAP could be floated through ... the characters, including the main ones, behave as they do for no discernible logical reason ... indeed, for no discernible *believable* (even if illogical) reason. They wander around the landscape doing downright stupid things (not all the time, to be fair) for a lot of the book.		They also display a mix of extreme gullibility, a total lack of common sense, and such piss poor planning (especially the so-called commanders of the whole project) that one would have to believe the entire population of the Old West and the entire modern day US military are drooling idiots with less than the IQ of a potted plant to actually behave in the way they do.		For example, the Project team shoot and kill a local lawman, downtime, 140 years in the past ... and, despite this being a Top Secret (and beyond) project, they report it to the Attorney General (not their own Chain of Command) who then appoints a *civilian* attorney with a hard on anti-military agenda, a *known* agenda, to "investigate" because "a US citizen was killed." Right. Pull the other one, it plays "Jingle Bells." On a Black Project! Right.		Or the agent they send into the past ... trained, allegedly, as a Gunsmith on old-time weapons (for no better reason, as far as I can tell, so the author can cut and paste archaic weapon arcana from Wikipedia, or somwhere, into the story in ways that are a pointless irrelevance) ... and, when he arrives in town, with no weapons, money, horse or equipment, he is only perfunctorily questioned even by the local gunsmith who makes such a cursory examination of his alleged skills that the whole scene is unbelievably lame.		Or the daughter of said Gunsmith, when he dies and the whole project goes to hell in a handbasket (unsurprising considering the morons in charge and at the coal face, both), and the agent tells her the "truth" she agrees to leave and go uptime with him ... *leaving her young (teenage) brother behind with nothing more than a letter from a distant relative offering him a job/training* ...		The dialog is so stilted that it's a whole crock in and of itself. *No-one* speaks the way the characters do ... no-one. Not even 140 years ago.		The "main" story meanders all over the place ... mainly because, as I said, the characters behave the way they do for no discernably logical or even obvious reason ... to the point where there seem to be at least three separate stories being told, only loosely interlinked ...		It's not *completely* awful. It's better than what a Fifth Grader could write, at the very least, and there are the germs of at least a couple of novels in it that, if handled by someone with a) greater experience and b) a ruthless agent and c) an equally ruthless editor, could possibly make interesting stories ... but, as they stand, don't waste your money or the hours of your life you'd have to invest to wade through the improbable plot, character behaviours and ridiculously stilted dialog.
1,Sorry, just boring.  Starting skimming around before halfway and just gave up with 25 percent left.  Just did not like either one of the to care what happens.
1,It's imcomplete.	The storyline is good, I'll grant you that, but it is very poorly developed.	The story jumps from one thing to the other without a link between the situations.	There was so much potential but unfortunately it did not deliver.
1,A very odd book. I won't comment on the content which was not romantic at all, but as far as writing goes, this book showed no signs of storytelling, going from random detail to another with very little connection.
1,I generally enjoy madcap mystery, but this story simply fizzled like a lackluster firework from the very first chapter.  I don't expect strong characterization from the genre, but the characters might have been cut out of cardboard and pasted on the page.  The plot was the merest trickle in a deluge of implausible events, and, rather than being funny, the names of each character just seemed oddball.  I gave up after the first half-dozen chapters and deleted it from my kindle.
1,This book wasn't for me. I need step by step instructions. Something I would get from a personal trainer. That's what I'm going to do.
1,Well this book is pissing me off.. Why why why, when a person try to do right someone is always trying to tear them down.. I gave this book 2 stars because of the mistakes.. I've been over looking the author's errors and I just couldn't do it in this book.. You have too many people going after one guy, Come on, Breeze is out of the game, you got someone trying to rob him, his so call girl is trying to set him up for a cop. Who want to put him behind bars. Because he is jealous of Breeze, for getting out of the game before getting busted with drugs.. Then you got the Carlton character, who thought Breeze's club belonged to him and just hiring people to come in and shoot cum all in the ladies faces on ladies night.. This book was just too much...
1,This book was WEIRD!!!!  Stupid, and just plain dumb.  I have no idea how else to describe this book.  It could have been better if the story line made any sence but it didnt.  Two people who have never met, wake up married and stay married and this was just plain stupid!!!
1,I did not enjoy this book nearly as much as all of her other works. Fell flat for me! disappointed
1,I think that the plot of the story took to long to come about. It's also kind of a weak story line.
1,Personally, I don't read Regency romances for tons of references to God, Jesus and the Lord, but if you do, then this may be for you. Way too preachy for me, and the heroine was as bland and boring as could be.
1,The story was interesting, but just STOPPED. 25 pages is NOT a Book! Its an intro to a book. And what's up with this......where is the real story that those pages were leading us to??? Or will we have to pay $3.99 for the next 20 page BOOK???	Sorry...not THAT interested.
1,This story would've had so much potential, had the author added details!	Stella is a female dragon who has never had her dragon come forward. In order to ensure she can shift back to her human self she needs to find her mate.		Okay. Let's pause here, there were so many details that could've been added to help make the reading easier. For instance, why is it a female shifter doesn't shift at will like the males? Why do they need their mate to ensure they can shift back? See there just was not any history about the dragons or anything that could help us understand a bit more of Stella's problem.		Brycen has been avoiding his mate to ensure he can do his job properly. He knows that if he mates with Stella right now he will be distracted. But when she starts to release him, all bets are off. Now he just has to hope he's in time to save her. Even with dragon hunters around trying to hurt them.		Again, details! Why was Brycen protecting a human? We have no idea what his job is. After he finds out about Alexandria's deceit what happens to her? Why couldn't he just let his other comrades watch over the human so he could've claimed his mate sooner?
1,I have all the Nikki Heat  and Derrick Storm books.  They were all four and five star until this one came out.  It is almost as bad as the eighth season.  Written well however, it follows a similar line to the last show, with Rook hardly represented and the end is as bad as the end in the series - up in the air, no REAL conclusion.  Don't waste your money like I did.
1,Let me start by saying that part of my favorite sentence in this book was "...as they circled each other like squabbling tiger lions." I think with just that one line you can see how this book is written. As other reviewers have said there are plenty of grammatical problems and this definitely needs an editor.		I think what I really dislike most about this book was that it was written in such a way that you'd hear most people thoughts along the lines of "Hey I should tell so and so about this and that" then in the next line or paragraph they would actually say "Hey so and so let me tell you about this and that."		This could be a much much better book, it just needs a good editor (and if it already had one they should be fired and a new one found)
1,I was given a free copy in return for a review.		I loved the premise. The introduction of the characters in the first two chapters caught my interest. However, by chapter 7 I was so bored that I didn't care about any of it anymore.		I'm trying to think of something constructive or useful to point out, but all I can say is that it felt very slow paced. I get the need to show the close proximity and set up background tension. I'm thinking that perhaps the lead-in prologue and first chapter could maybe have been condensed into character thoughts as the story progressed. Maybe that would have helped push the mystery aspect as well as allowed for the story to move forward at a faster pace.		I also felt that the two hopped into bed super fast. The reasons given felt superficial to me. At that point I decided I needed to move on to the next book in my tbr pile.		I wish this could have been a more positive review.
1,No comparison to her other books.  This was just a short little story with a bad ending.  Lots of action but not the sAme as her other books
1,I like this series, but I think this book is my least favorite. It was interesting how Chase was supposedly so in love with Jazzie in the last book, but immediately fell for Jenny in this one.		I didn't like Jenny through most of the book. Chase and Jenny had chemistry, but she just wasn't likeable. She seemed pretty childish to be a doctor.		I think I would have enjoyed this more if less time was spent on Jenny reacting to what she thought she knew about Chase, and more time spent on the oil rig issue. I admit that I skimmed some of this book because it was just plain boring.  I read the previous 6 books and didn't encounter that problem.  Maybe we can get back to the cowboys again. I think 3 of the characters made career changes before the book was done, and one changed  over to ranching.		More of Chase and Jenny's family were introduced.  You still got a global kids mode of the earlier characters in the series.  I liked Chase's brother, Joel.  I would be interested in his story.
1,Along with everyone else, this book hasn't been fixed yet. Still no content.
1,As slow as molasses in January. Never seemed to get off the ground. I gave up 2/3 of the way through it.
1,ok
1,I really disliked this book, perhaps because I have survived significant pain myself.  The main character faints whenever possible to any level of stress.  She can't deal with the problems of life.  And rather than giving us insight into how to deal with the pain of loss she bumbles around, mentions "embrace the pain" and just as she might finally face it head-on we get a twist and an unrealistic ending.		I was hoping for insight.  If you are too, don't bother reading this book.  You won't find it here!
1,this book started out with a bang and I thought it was going to be an enticing read.  it turned into a history of erotic spanking which took away the light-hearted essence of the story and made it very dry and wordy.  there wasn't much of a plot and the ending was kind of strange.  one thing this author needs to do is separate sections of the book better.  one minute the characters will be sitting at a table talking about something and then the very next paragraph they will suddenly be checking into a hotel.  when these types of things happen there needs to be some sort of break in the formatting.  I was always going back and rereading parts because I thought I had missed something.
1,Too many unanswered plots and questions.  Even the characters were sketchy.  I don't care to purchase the seven books in this series to find out..  sorry but I did not care for this book at all!
1,2 1/2 stars. I liked it up until book three.  It didn't understand the point of book three. Once I got there I had to finish but I honestly didn't read it. I skimmed through it. This was a cute story that could and should have been told in 1 or 2 stories. I don't recommend reading book 3. Just read 1 and 2 and test that it's a happy ending. No marriage or babies just a decent happy ending.
1,I love a good true crime story, but this was a collection of VERY abbreviated stories. I prefer a more in depth look at these certifiably crazy people!
1,This new trend of authors selling books that are incomplete is infuriating.  "Rush to Justice" was an enjoyable story right up until it ended in the middle of no where and to continue the story the reader must purchase the next book in the series.		I truly hope other readers out there will take the same stand that I have and refuse to purchase books that  end during the climax if the story.		It is also inconceivable to me that McIntosh asked readers to write a review  on an unfinished book.
1,I never read this as a child, and as an adult I find it too sugary and too dull.  I didn't get very far.
1,have not received this book. amazon is screwing up a lot lately.
1,Micro pinprick font on kindle. Mostly just a coloring book I can't color. A few patterns but once again too small to really see. Lots of blank cards to do your own tangles on, if ya could...
1,At 30% and not sure i want to finish. extremely boring so far. Nothing is holding my attention. sorry, will update if i can finish it.	Ok, nothing changed, still boring, but I gave 2 stars, because i did finish the book.
1,Not as user friendly as |I had hoped!  The description makes you think it is interactive and it isn't
1,although it was free really not worth the time
1,Paradise Lost is my favorite Christian literature of all time, in my opinion even surpassing the Authorized King James Version of the Holy Bible in its poetics. Paradise Lost is also one of my favorite poems of all times. Unfortunately, this poem was nowhere near as good as its prequel. On the plus side, there were a handful of good lines here, but over all not the strength and beauty of Paradise Lost. Which is unfortunate, from a Christian point of view. Paradise Lost concerns the fall of grace of mankind, while Paradise Regained is mostly about the temptation of Jesus by Satan in the desert. One would hope the poem focusing on Jesus would be better than the one focusing mostly upon Satan, but not so in this case. Ah, well.
1,Started out as a good book.  Well written, good plot and just beginning to develop characters when, to my surprise, it ended!
1,no comment
1,I think I was the wrong audience for this book. It was just too far fetched for me. It might, however, appeal to a recently divorced woman who wants to prove her worth to a self-centered ex-husband. Too bad it's usually (never?) that simple. It was a fast read and had some good moments though.
1,I liked the first one well enough.  I did not like this one.  The sophomoric love triangle was not a pleasure to work thru.  Our hero's angst over his fear of relationships exhausted me. Did not find much to recommend here
1,Good story that went rotten. I stopped the series. Wouldn't recommend.
1,couldnt even read the whole thing ... and I LOVE to read .. this was a waste of my time
1,Kind of predictable romance. The characters seemed one dimensional. It did not seem like a Christian book to me.
1,This book is REALLY short (esp for $2.99).  It also seems unfinished.  There is a lot more that could have been written to make the story better.
1,Would be a good book if it wasn't so overly sexual. It's hard to believe the characters when they use language that no one who respects their mate would ever say.
1,Since this is a public forum I will keep my thoughts clean on this review. I can normally keep an open mind about a lot but this book made me want to punch the author.
1,I didn't like it..I didn't like it at all ,couldn't make myself finish it... I'm soo completely	and utterly SICK of all this Dominate  Alpha male Bull s h i t  meaning he has to be a thoughtless	JERK bossing the woman around and her taking his rough often thoughtless treatment like its ok	and wonderful because a) he makes her panties wet and b) since she's not some skinny stick figure	no man is of course supposed to want her, so when this sexy stranger is making demands of her to	bend over in all sorta ways or demanding she obey all his commands other wise she must be wanting to be	"disciplined",BS but that's ok coz he's Hot and sexy right?  and she's just supposed to be thankful a healthy sized	woman can find a man that wants her right? coz honestly that's the message i get from it.. sexy guy wants to starts	yanking her around by her hair and wants to tie her up or subdue her before he'll f her.. Hey I tried reading 50 shades	it wasn't my things and I wished I listened to all the reviews about how sucky it was,why do i bring it up? well were the guys in the	books always such demanding jerks that thought of themselves 1st and the women 2nd and the women such willing doormats?	or did i miss something? I thought we'd left that with the harlequin romances back in the '80's..	off my soap box,while I'm soo completely for a strong yummy alpha type over flowing with passion wanting me!!! I would still want	kindness,and love and respect and treated like an f toy while I wet my panties, thats NOT hot :(
1,I read the teaser chapter for this novella and it sounded interesting so I bought it, even though for such a short story, it is expensive. I've not read anything by this author before and was willing to take a chance.		+++Spoilers+++	Sadly for me I didn't like the actual nitty gritty stuff of this story. The h dated the H's brother for a year and had an active, sexual relationship with him before he broke her heart and left her when he went off to follow his career. The H is his identical twin and had had a thing for the h for years. He keeps in touch with her for 2 years after her break-up before making his move and inviting her to Eden, a fictitious island made popular by 37 different authors I believe. I've read one or two of those stories but don't really remember them, which isn't a good sign. Anyway although the h was hoping the invitation was from the H's brother, she soon discovers that it's the H who invited her. After 2 years she's still pining for the brother. The H and h get heavy very quickly and that's the dealbreaker for me. I have issues with this kind of storyline. I can't help feeling that the h wasn't good enough for one brother so she 'settles' for another. The author really works hard for this not to be the case but I hate the idea of the h having been with both men. We can't get around the fact that she was with the other brother for a year. For me it's bit of an 'ick'.
1,Full disclosure: I was provided with a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.		The Good News: The author Jasmin Clara seems to have her finger accurately placed on the pulse of single young women faced with the daunting, competitive rituals associated with watching their girl friends get married.  While there is a some angst associated with being the little brown wren in a flock of white-gowned peacocks, there is also quite a lot of humor to be found.  This is what makes the premise of 'A Bride's Guide' so promising.		The Bad News: As this book was billed as a romantic comedy, it was my hope that the humor would take center stage.  Unfortunately the opportunity for smart, biting female relationship humor was lost in a sea of clothing and shoes descriptions, unlikely situations, weak character development, and poor writing characterized by awkward sentence structure, questionable capitalization, short, choppy paragraphs and narrative that lacked any kind of coherent flow.  The author's tendency to shy away from non-clothing related descriptive detail and extended dialog left this reader with long passages of 'tell, rather than show.'  All of these deficits could have been cleared up with the efforts of strong editor with a clear sense of coherent storytelling.		A Suggestion: The best ideas fail with poor execution which is what I believe happened with 'Bride's Guide.'  I wish Ms. Clara good luck and success in her writing endeavors, but urge her to hook up with a good, tough editor and some honest beta readers.  That way the next good idea may get the success it deserves.
1,It was one of the few books I couldn't finish. The plot doesnt make sense, the number of secrets kept from the main character are ridiculous, the way she acts is childish, its just not worth the time or money (thank goodness it was free this time)
1,This three book set can best be summed up as mediocre at best.		The author Ryk Brown sets the stage of his new series with a somewhat familiar plot.  A group of raw cadets are placed as the skeleton crew of a brand new spaceship, an accident happens that kills every single senior member of the crew leaving an unqualified rookie in command, add in the stoic first officer and a racial stereotype chief engineer.  If this sounds familiar it should, the book basically takes better known character archtypes from the Star Trek reboot movies and plunks knock offs into a Star Wars style story.  The rest of the story is a string of very vague plot threads and freak accidents that strand our novice heroes far from home in dangerous space.		The author has chosen to treat this as a "soft science fiction" story, wherein he chooses to gloss over the technical reasons for the technologies being used and simply goes with the standard ideas we have seen in other better known series such as Star Trek and Star Wars.  Unfortunately this tendency to avoid explaining things extends into the plot as well, the story teases the reader with glimmers of interesting things but then quickly pulls back without giving any proper explanations.  It almost feels as if the author is afraid of overwhelming the reader at times.  Sadly this means that we rarely get proper explanations for the stories current events or the major players involved.  We are teased with a villain that is threatening the people of Earth but we are given almost no information at all about who or what they are actually about.  We are teased with a backstory about a plague ravaging future Earth and plunging it into a thousand year dark age, but we never get the details until book three.		Many events in the story rely so heavily on blind luck and plot convenience that my willing suspension of disbelief was stretched beyond its limit.  Many aspects of the story are far beyond the realm of reasonable expectations.  For example a big part of the plot is how the Earth is in vital need of an advanced new faster than light propulsion system.  So the leadership of Earth sees fit to stick every member of their FTL research team onto an unfinished understaffed ship, with the only prototype and no copies of the blueprints back home, and then sends them off on a test flight.  Test flights using new technology are inherently dangerous, so putting all your eggs into that basket is beyond absurd.		Then that brings us to the situation of our main hero Nathan who goes from being fresh out of the academy to filling the role of captain in a matter of a single book.  Due to the circumstances we are led to believe that the ship departed so totally understaffed that a single accident was able to eliminate every member of the crew with more than two weeks of experience.  This is compounded by the fact that Nathan never comes across as having any professional training despite having just spent four years at Earth's officer training academy.  Every event only serves to make him look like a random college student who just happened to stumble on board the Earth's most important space ship.		The final flaw of the books is that they aren't really written as individual stories, but as a single multipart episodic series.  As such each book ignores the usual story telling format of having a defined beginning and ending and simply treats this as chunks of a single larger story.  This format unfortunately compounds many of the problems with the lack of proper explanations and details, as the readers are simply expected to read future "episodes" to fill in those blanks later.		Overall the book feels like it is geared towards a younger demographic.  The events and manner of the story telling come across like teenage wish fulfillment.  Older readers will find many of the ideas in the book to be derivative and lacking in terms of originality.  There is a small foundation of interesting ideas sprinkled in here, but they are never given enough time to really take root.  There just isn't anything to really hook the reader to keep going.		As such I can't give this three book set any higher a score than this.  It is simply mediocre in most regards and geared more towards children than adults.
1,This book was a complete waste of time and money, and it really didn't get anywhere talk about a total cliff hanger and why in the hell is Dallas back i was glad she was gone and now here she is again. Obviously the author just wanted some extra money and to piss people off, me anyways only to come out with the next part next month. Whatever
1,not my favorite book by this author.  I have loved everything else she has written this one just wasn't for me.
1,Finally finished this ridiculous book.	Let me start by saying Brant has the WORST. SISTERS. EVER.	These ungrateful (insert bad word here) are just horrible, selfish human beings.	Brant pissed me off over and over again. He had so many chances of running to the cops and tell them everything. Yet, he never did.	At times, it seemed as though he was enjoying being a thug.	I felt no chemistry between him and Wilber. And his supposedly sensual scenes were just super awkward and uncomfortable to read. (Who uses the word 'portal'?) ... Seriously.	Now, we know Constantine is a monster, but, the wife here is the real sociopath.	I did not enjoy this book at all.
1,Some spoilers ahead.	I don't even know where to begin. This book was not good. I was excited to read it after the first book in this series, but it was nowhere near as good as the first book. I'm not sure why these authors insist on creating a series for these books, as subsequent books are rarely as good as the first one. The two main characters were awful. Emma was not only self-centered and selfish, but also incredibly immature. She basically had no problem letting Andrew taking the blame for an accident that she caused after she begged him to let her drive. She knew he had been convicted of hitting someone while driving drunk and high - what did she think would happen to him!? She claims not to have known where he ended up after the accident which, frankly, is an unbelievable detail this author included. They lived in a small town where everyone seemed to know everyone else's business and there's google and the news, so it's almost impossible that she would not have known Andrew was sent to a reform school. She never really apologized to him or thanked him for taking the fall for her. Andrew is equally as annoying. He is portrayed as a tough badass (sorry, but I don't know any badass who lets their girlfriend verbally fight off bullies as he did in the beginning of the book), but he's really just a wishy washy wimp, and is nothing more than a doormat who gets paid to throw fights. He is also incredibly immature. What he did to Emma's roommate Lindsey is awful. Although neither Andrew or Emma seemed to concerned about Lindsey as they hooked up rather than try to mend things with her. I think the final straw for me was the ridiculous and unnecessary plot twist at the end. The only redeeming quality about this book was the brief inclusion of Owen and Kensi. I hate to compare this book to the first book, but it's hard not to. In the first book the characters were much more developed and were likable with depth to them. I didn't know much about Andrew or Emma (other than her parents overprotectiveness and her heart issues) and what I did know I did not like. Also, in the first book, there was more of a slow build romance. In this book Andrew and Emma were in love after just days? I honestly did not feel the chemistry between them. Their relationship had no real substance. They met and all of a sudden were in love. Their entire relationship was based on a couple of days or weeks spent together when they were 16. The entire plot of this book was just so boring and dragged until about the last 20% when it became absurd. I found myself frequently skimming and skipping over parts of this book and I could barely finish it. I'm really disappointed because I was looking forward to this book. This author should have quit while she was ahead.
1,If they had said this book was a preview it would have been better. To get a book and expect it to have an ending is not a great request. To end a book in the middle of a story is not good practice.  Then to say buy book 2 to find out what happens is atrocious.	What will they do, say buy book 3 and 4 to see what happens.
1,I was rather disappointed with myself for buying the book. It started out well and got more than boring by the time I was done. It was a total waste of time. If you are looking for a decent story with a plot,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS
1,I struggled to finish this book. The characters weren't very well developed and the story was just all over the place. Too much of how perfect, handsome, good looking, spectacular the h was. The story felt too modern, not very historical at all.
