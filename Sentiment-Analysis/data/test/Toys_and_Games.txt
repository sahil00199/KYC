0,Grandson had lots of fun with this.  Winding the hook up and down.
0,It's her spirit animal!! What more can I say?
0,This is the nice thicker plastic that is hard to find and it fits multiple kids at it and it is so cute. All the kids love it. It is hard to put together the seat was off a little and needed a little help fitting into the molded area where it was suppose to help but thanks to a handy husband it is up and getting played with a lot. Would recommend this one, this is now our 4th kitchen and my kids are 4 and under.
0,Nice
0,Super soft and beautiful music which plays good amount of time. Bought one for friends new baby. My mom who is a great-Grandma loved it n cuddled it so immediately ordered one for her. So newborn and a 91 Great Grammy enjoying them together.
0,I bought a few of these during Christmas and they are awesome. My kids and I have nerf wars all over the house. Word of caution: these things do shoot out with a good amount of force. Not really enough to hurt anyone, but definitely enough to break something if valuables are nearby. My 4 year old needs help to pull back the lever to make it shoot, because it does require a little bit of strength, but other tan that, these are perfect! Make sure to get plenty of ammo!
0,Good quality and the face was lovely!
0,nice size for gift table...good colors
0,perfect little transmitter.		minus one star for no power indicator. i leave it on accidentally about once per week.
0,Came in at perfect timing. My friend loves it a lot
0,Bought this for our toy room when grandkids or company come. I will say I was surprised it only came with one kitten... I bought on a lighting deal, so 40 bucks well worth that
0,My daughter now 4 loved this game it was her fav until she got her Olivia one from Santa.  It is easy to use and teaches them many things
0,Grandson loved Mr. Potato Head Tater Tub set for Christmas.  He's 4 and this was just what he uses at school so he knew immediately what to do with it.  For added fun we used the parts with a real potato just like when I was a kid.
0,My little on loves this!
0,My daughter's (ages 9-15) love this game so much we often give as a gift.
0,Needed this for a school program - it took longer to get here than expected with Prime.  My issue is probably more to do with Prime - "one-day" is really TWO days.  One day for processing and another day for shipping.  The waist on this is TINY.  I have a very small 8 year old so she was OK, but she only weighs 50 lbs.  It just isn't very proportional... it's quite long for as small as the waste is.
0,Very cute little toy.  Lots of things to do and my son uses the tools for everything else.  He especially loves the drill.
0,This costume is super well made of durable fabric.  It should last for years.  It fits true to size.  I bought a size larger in order to maximize the use it will get.  My son wore it for Halloween and was paid many compliments.
0,Nice detail and it looks good but the tracks aren't very sturdy.  The tracks on the Tiger tank were much better.	I would have given it three stars due to the tracks by my 7 year old said the cover that opens over the engine compartment more than made up for it.
0,Really great selection of objects.
0,Perfect little book to keep a baby entertained. The crunchy sound can keep a baby busy for a good 15 minutes.
0,Awesome graphics, somewhat difficult to understand instructions, but fairly easy to learn once you get the hang of it.		Nice playing time as a game can be completed in a half hour or so for two players.		This isn't a D&D style strategy game, but is more of a Go tile placement game.
0,Adorable and none of the glitter or color comes off! My three year old does have some trouble opening some of the containers though.
0,My son will be super happy for Christmas, this is sold out everywhere.  I think it was way over priced but it is sold out, and didn't want to take the chance that I wouldn't find it later.
0,My great grandson loves this Mickey Mouse............
0,loved this toy goes in water on carpet grass and even snow. I like this toy for small kids because it is not to fast and easy to control. my 6,5 and two year old love it and i play with it too. it is very durable takes the abuse of a rought 2 year old. make sure to check what frequency it is we have two of them the Rover and Killer Whale.
0,Great fun.
0,Very cute diary
0,Elenco has been a great company for DIY kits and parts. Also some nice test equipment at a nice price. May not be Top of the Line,but works fairly well for much less the price.
0,AHH Rick!
0,my grandson loved the book and has since passed it on
0,Grandaughter keeps a basket of Lalaloopsy mini littles in her bathroom when she is visiting and loves playing in the water with the littles. Color does not fade.
0,This is an excellent educational product for a small child, but not a toddler,  Because of the large number of small playing pieces this is not good for a toddler or a child likes to chomp on the pieces; with this aside, it is an outstanding educational product.  It is colorful and loaded with useful information about the nations of the world.  A young person can gather lots of information about the world, and it is a great interactive tool to use with an adult, and they can together discuss the illustrations and then look them up on the net for more information.  The one negative is the small size.  It would have been a terrific product if it was 50% larger.
0,My baby loved this.
0,they float, they stick , and my kid loves them.
0,Pretty easy to put together
0,The idea of having to put out a submarine fire definitely caught my attention, and I've enjoyed playing these scenarios when I get the chance!
0,Great item! Will make	A little boy very happy at Christmas!
0,So pretty!
0,Cute, but you definitely need the track with it.  It would be boring without it.
0,if you are looking for a great puzzle and one that will capture your attention while doing and fun to look at after ... this is for you!
0,Perfect for at home and in the car activities.  In sizes, LEGOS and plates can be housed in a shoebox and kept together for activities at home, in the car, and at Grandma's house.  Outstanding idea to have these made in sizes.  Grandson loves them.
0,These Silving Lining Cloud ball rattles are pretty cute.  I have the matching activity play mat gym and these are a nice addition to that set.  Each of the balls has a different sound when shaken, and the balls all offer a variety of textures for a fun sensory experience for baby as he or she plays with the toys.  There's a cute little sun with multi colored rays that crinkle, the moon has a crinkly star that dangles from it and the rainbow ball has two fuzzy white cloud flaps.  The only thing I don't really like about them is the nice fabrics are only on the front of the rattles.  The reverse is this fuzzy short nap polyester material that doesn't exactly feel nice when you touch it.  The toys would be a lot nicer if they didn't cheap out on the quality of the material on the backs of the toy.

0,I have been wanting to purchase this for some time and happy that I did. Now we don't have to keep track of the money, not to mention with the kiddos the money gets tossed around so re organizing the money is crazy. This comes with no actual money and has a cleaner, faster game play. The board looks great and the credit card reader keeps track of everything. The only thing I don't like is that they went cheap on the characters. Cheap plastic, :-( .. Would have been nice it they were metal.
0,Great Stem Project my daughter loves these activities! As a mom they have been pretty fun too
0,got it on time and it ended up making my hsbanded very happy
0,1.5 boy & 3.5 yr old girl fought over these toy and played for hrs w it. lol. not even in the bathtub yet. they like it so much on dry land/play room, im thinking of not making it a bath toy- but keeping it in the play room instead. when they get tired of it in the play room, then move it to the tub. we bought this toy w the seacopter at the same time, so the reviews for both the ferry boat w mini cars and the seacopter will be the same. they loved them both. will be buying these as gifts for other kids...
0,nice product
0,Love this (Mattel) GHOSTBUSTERS II "SLIME BLOWER"WINSTON ZEDDEMORE Adult Collector's Figure! Looks wonderful with the rest of the Mattel GB & GB 2 figures I currently own! Highly recommended to the collector!!! A -
0,:)
0,The Stegoceratops is awesome! In the movie, Hoskins shows Zach, Gray, Claire, and Owen a Stegoceratops and Gray says that it isn't a real dinosaur. Hoskins even ADMITS it's not! So to the person that said it's the only not real dinosaur in the line besides the Indominus, you're technically correct. The screw holes aren't a big problem, I don't mind them. Yes, It's not an electronic dinosaur, but there's probably a need for it. The wound is even more awesome! This is probably my favorite Bashers and Biters.
0,We love this toy! We love Green Toys! Great for the baby, and for the toddler to show the baby.
0,So cute and much bigger than expected. My daughter is going to love it.
0,Excelente educational toy, came on time and perfect packed, my son loves this toy and in general  Im very satisfied	thank you.	I'm definitely recommend this store.
0,Love it!  I love Melissa and Doug! Their toys are always very high-quality and creative. My son loves these. He fills them with all kinds of pretend foods.
0,At first I could not figure out how this winds up as there were no instructions. I was so disappointed until I discovered the arms do start to click if you wind them backwards. I felt stupid for not noticing but I was expecting a knob or something like many wind up toys have. My 16mo ild is mildly interested in it and is too young to wind up herself. When you lift it out of the water and drain the excess, put it back under and all the bubbles come rising to the surface like a real little scuba diver. Nice effect. It would be nice if the little feet also moved.
0,Small pieces. Need to take lots of times and follow the instructions carefully
0,My son aged 2 loves paw patrol and this is a great starter puzzle. Its nice, thick foam and easy enough for him to work on by himself. The foam also makes it easy to build on the carpet. It is a bit smaller than I expected but we are very happy with this puzzle and get use out of it daily!
0,This is a pretty fun addition to our Imaginext collection.  The remote isn't that easy to control but it does work.  My only complaint is that there really aren't many play options for Imaginext figures.  Other than that, it's a cool toy and the rapid fire projectiles are lots of fun.
0,So cute! Looks just as pictured, size is perfect for a little one. Really, really soft!
0,I have 3 boys (8, 5 and 1), at first they did not know what to do with these rubber things. It was a birthday present that I thought would be a bit neat. They opened it up and then forgot about it looking at all their new electronics and video games. Well, dad comes to the rescue. I broke open these suckers and started sticking them to the window and creating long chains. Lo and behold that caught the interest of the kids and the wrath of my wife but hey, the boys love it now.
0,My granddaughter loves it!!!!!!
0,I bought two of the Simon Micro Series Game.	One for a gift and one for my Grannie's Toy Chest for my grandchildren.	I have two larger kinds of Simon but I think this smaller one will be good for travel / sick bed use.	Good thing to say, this one comes with batteries.
0,Everyone pretty much expressed the beauty and fabulousness of those dolls and I totally agree, I think all had been said so now something that I think every parent who bought this doll for an older then 3 child and has younger children at home should absolutely know before making the purchase:		And this is coming from a parent who absolutely adore those dolls !...		So.. beware! each of the dolls comes with stud earrings! and the most surpisingly the studs are just .. stucked into the ears without anything holding them in place. They sit pretty tight I have to admit but.. it took my 5 year old one split second to remove them from the doll without any effort.		What came out was rather scary.. a sharp stud earring small and pointy.		I can not immagine horror of a mother who's little baby or toddler comes in contact with this doll and manages to pull EASILY the earrings from the ears and insert in to the mouth.		Since we rearly live in vacume and have our children and their toys isolated from younger siblings therefore parents at least should know that this doll comes with major safety issue when younger siblings are concerned.		We all know that toy manufacturers put all those chocking hazard warnnings on everything smaller then 2 inches and we all have seen many children under 3 playing with them this way or the other and most of them still have very minimal chocking hazard. However this doll series seemingly safe should never be left unsupervised around a young infant or a toddler because of the earrings issue.		I don't know if there is any part of the doll that could be hazardous to a child so a parent inspecting the doll might miss this issue but this seem rather major hazard as this is not only chocking hazard but also health hazard as even if a child won't chocke on the earring, it might cause some damage to the throath, or other organs not to mention unknown make up of the material in the earring iteslf and it's hazard to the blood system.		This could have been so simple if the maker would only made those earrings permanently implemented into the ears.		Again, I absolutely love the way the dolls look and we have all of them, however since my child surely will be playing with other younger children around first thing I did was to negotiate the removal of the earrings and luckily to full understanding and cooperation of the little owner. I still would never leave a child under 3 unsupervised for a moment with this doll but I am sure that now it is much less challenging task if a youngster comes about.
0,awesome figure
0,So cute! Great birthday present!
0,Just as big and fat as Jabba in the movie, this is an adorable Funko POP.  Each of the Funko POP figurines have remarkable resemblance to the actual characters.
0,We first saw it at one of the restaurants in Vermont.  They got coloring books and these crayons instead of cheap crayons that break.  Of course, we couldn't bring these home with us, but I ordered these on Amazon when we got back home.  Instead of buying boxes and boxes of crayons that are all over the place, just get this box.  One per kid.  Sooo nice!
0,This is super cute. Well made looks good on a book self. Great for kids of all ages. Ships fast no real complaints.
0,The possibilities for imaginative play are endless.  I love that all of the pieces are exactly the same, save the color.  My boys LOVE them.  If a piece is lost (they are pretty small), it isn't a deal breaker as it is with Legos because you always have more of the same piece.  Legos are great, but when you lose an important and one of a kind piece, there is some disappointment.  I give it four stars ONLY because they are REALLY pricey.  These are the smaller ones (mini) (5 yo-adult).  The bigger size are MIDI (more for 3-5 yo)
0,Even cuter and snuggelier  in person. My grandson loves it!
0,This was a very heavy duty, well made toy.  The boys played with this for hours and are still using it.  It was a very good buy and would recommend to anyone.  Great product.
0,Babies and children will love this fantastic drum. If purchasing for a baby just set aside the drumstick for when they are older. There is a handy holder for the drumstick attached to the drum.
0,Bought this for my three and four year olds for Christmas and they LOVE it.  It is super simple to transform between a vehicle and a robot, and they have had many hours of fun playing with it and their other rescue bots.  They like the rescue bots cartoon and I think that helped them enjoy these toys as they often quote lines form the show or sing the theme song as they play.  The light blue piece that attaches is kind of a pain, it doesn't stay on very well and for my kids they just don't play with that part.
0,I bought this to fill out an order and get overnight free shipping.	What a revelation.	At 2 months she was whacking at the Einstein to keep it flashing and playing.	The flashing lights are not the seizure inducing type.
0,My son loved this set. More mini figures and vehicles. And the directions seemed clearer on this set than other large sets we've built. Another great Lego product.
0,just what the wife was looking for.
0,Fun toy for my little Daniel Tiger fan. As advertised. Cute. Durable.
0,very cute and entertaining
0,Bought this to donate to a little girl who is fighting cancer. She loved it and was so thrilled. Thank you for having an affordable dress. It is beautiful.
0,Great card!  Bought this card to create a chaos deck for my son to play with.  He loves it!
0,I was amazed at how fast this boat actually was.  Some boats say they are fast and they are slower than a turtle.  This thing is super fast!  It throws water out the back of it like a jet ski because it is traveling so fast.  It makes sharp turns and since it is so fast you can actually ramp and get some airtime over the wake the boat makes.  It is pretty sturdy and makes quick sharp turns.  The only problem I would say is that the propellers are exposed and do not have a cover.  This means the things can easily be wrapped around them like small weeds and grass.  Other than that I am extremely happy!
0,thanks
0,Everything OK
0,Love the birthday ball line! I have Rosabella and Cedar. They look so pretty in their pastel dresses and LOVE the different hair colors! I can't wait for them to release the other three characters in this line! I wish I could give it a 4.5 rating, alas, it has to be either a four or five. The reason I didn't give it a perfect rating is because I would have liked them to have more accessories like tights, earrings, a ring or bracelet. They would have looked so beautiful with sheer tights or fishnets in the same pastel color as their dress! Still, I am very happy I bought them and they are a great addition to my collection.
0,Very pleased item was exact and got here very fast.
0,Excellent
0,Love the details and her look. She looks so unique compared to the other ladies in my collection.
0,It''s streamer. What else can I say.  Was very inexpensive so glad didn't get from party store.
0,Well made figure and very whimsical.  Good stuff!
0,This is very good, I used it for a 'boys' dolls house for my son. I had to glue some of it together as it was a bit loose, but overall it's great.
0,great
0,Great quality
0,My daughters loved these!
0,Something about deadpool in a blue looks wrong. Other than that it's great!
0,If you want the most realistic large scale construction or farm equipment toy for your child, look no further than a Bruder toy. This particular truck is enormous - about 3 feet long - and extremely realistic. The only downside is that the truck is not particularly durable. While my 4 year olds love to play with this, I know they will break it or parts of it sooner than they would break a Tonka truck.
0,Fairly easy to put together and my daughter likes it very much.  18" dolls fit nicely.	The mattress and pillows are cheap and disappointing but we can add our own.
0,perfect 100%
0,This set is a combination of the "Total Turbo Takeover" track set and a few of the smaller sets that you can buy in the hot wheel track builder series. Here is the current value breakdown:		The Total Turbo Takeover set consists of 2 x Quick kick loops, the two way booster, the rock slide, a launcher, two 180 degree curves, a single "blast alley" unit and a single hot wheel car .  This set is currently selling for $45 (but would cost out over $60 if all the parts were bought individually)...		You also get the following with the Mega Set (with costs if purchased separately):	1 x Launch pack (currently $10)	1 x Barrel Drop (currently $10)	1 x Cannon Launch (currently $10)	1 x Curve pack (currently $10)	1 x Crate Crash (currently $5)	1 x Track Pack (currently $10)	1 x Area 68 (currently $5)	3 hot wheel cars (currently $3)		This totals out at $103 so it is a marginal deal when prices are around $94 as they are now (1/2015) but watch for sales/promotions as this sometimes comes down to under $50 which is a screaming deal.		Playability wise, it does take a little while to put everything together but my son saw no reason to set up the course as they showed it but instead just kept adding and testing various pieces/stunts until the whole set was used. In fact, we break everything down for storage after playing with it and he builds in an entirely different way the every time. As others have noted, not all the cars make it through all the stunts/boosters without crashing but that generally only means you need to use a different hot wheel car (or just realign the track a bit).		Safety wise, there is a chance for little fingers to get smashed as the rubber band launchers have quite a bit of force and the two way booster fires cars off at a very high rate of speed. Also, the rock slide rocks and the cannon ball are both choking hazards that should be kept away from younger siblings.		Ultimately, I have had just as much fun as my son has with this set and we have purchased additional track packs to make even bigger and more exciting designs.
0,Great product, liked very much
0,Great organizer I use this one only for magnetic beads, I have one for each type of bead types I have they keep things organized
0,Great Condition!
0,cute but tiny
0,My daughter gave me this beautiful tiger for Mother's Day and I have come to love it very much!!! It's absolutely beautifully made, so natural, so elegant, so real.  I bought Hank the Husky dog from Alaska and Timurova the white Siberian tiger for my daughter and they are all beautiful, but Rohit is the most handsome, we all love him at home.
0,Easy enough to learn.  Pick 3 dice, and roll, score the brains, first player to 13 brains wins.  You can either roll a brain, footprints (meaning your prey got away) or a blast (meaning you got shot), 3 blasts and you're out, no score for brains you collected.  Trick is to stop before that happens.  3 different colored dice, red has more chances of getting shot, yellow less, and green more likely to roll brains.  You don't get to see the dice you choose to roll.  Select them blind from the shaker can. Everything stores in the can and has a very nice fitting lid to keep the dice from spilling out in storage.	The ONLY reason I didn't give this a 5 star is the can is VERY LOUD!!!  It hurts my ears to hear the dice hit the bottom of it!  Not something you'd play if you had to be quiet, or if someone has a headache.  Somehow the dice rolling is way quieter than shaking them in the can.	Otherwise a nice family game for all ages.
0,GREAT my girlfriends son loves it
0,A fun play set.
0,Me likey
0,Super great stuffy. Really nice detail and quality.

0,Great product, great price and fast shipping AA+
0,This card is the ultimate in terms of offense, I do enjoy the new secret rarity. A good look for a strong card. Definitely worth putting in your deck.
0,This doll was a gift for my granddaughter for her 10th birthday.  The doll is actually quite attractive, the clothes are stylish and modern, her accessories are very interesting (especially to a 10 year old) and the articulation of the body joints is really quite amazing.  We loved the fact that the wig can be removed and "Sophie" can go from long hair to a buzz cut instantly.  There is a piece of paper attached to the back of the cardboard explaining the trick of how to place the wig on the doll's head again after it is removed the first time.  The accessories which come with the doll are very, very small, as is to be expected for a doll of this size so the choking/hazard warnings should be taken very seriously.		There is one very important thing you will need to take into account when opening this package.  Do not expect to have your child playing with this product immediately.  Every single loose item attached to the doll, or even an item which MIGHT become loose, is anchored down with incredibly thin, clear filament line which takes some hard work to remove.  And a sharp pointed instrument!  Even this doll's hair was anchored down.  After the wrestling match involved in removing "Sophie" from the packaging was finished I then had to find and pick up all those tiny pieces of filament in order to throw them away.		The doll is really quite marvelous and my grandgirl absolutely loved her from the first minute she saw her, but there are many, many tiny pieces of accessories and the packaging was quite a struggle to deal with.  Especially with an excited 10 year old jumping from one foot to the other waiting for me to get all the tie-downs cut!
0,this was a gift for a peanuts loving friend. perfect!
0,This was a gift for my brother, who loves playing Minecraft.  Perhaps he's too old for Lego (oh who am I kidding?  You're never too old for Lego) but he was pretty excited to begin building.  Great variety in pieces and what you're able to do!
0,I used these as favors for my son's train themed birthday party. I bundled them up with bandanas and whistles and put them in a cute suitcase. They were a big hit. The quality of the product is not amazing but for favors they are just fine. My son still wears his train hat occasionally. It's adorable.
0,I bought this because my kids are so interested in pretending they are a doctor.  I wanted something where you could really hear a heartbeat.  You can hear the heartbeat through this but it needs to be quiet to hear it since it is a faint sound.
0,My children have discovered that if they want Furby to be nice to them they need to be nice to it.  Also, the iPad app is really fun for them to play with as well.  I ended up buying on for my three year old and she plays with it just as easily as my six year old does.
0,One of the highlights of early season three of AMC's The Walking Dead was the struggle of Rick and company to clear out the prison of walkers. Arguably, it was the zombies still decked out in their riot control gear that not only were the greatest challenge; but also the most memorable. And as far as Funko's Walking Dead POPs are concerned; the Prison Guard is among the best of them. Not only is the Prison Guard nicely detailed in the creepy but cute style that all the Walking Dead zombie POPs enjoy; but this guy also features something pretty unusual for a POP; what I'm talking about is articulation! The visor of his riot control helmet can be moved!	All in all, this little zombie makes a great POP. Nicely detailed and weathered and also has a good pose, hecanstand just fine on his own. He's gone up in value a tad since his initial release so grab one while you can!
0,My daughter got a few of these dolls for Christmas, and loves them, only complaint is the velcro on the clothes doesn't hold well, and the shoes are a bit hard for her to change (the shoes have a ball socket on the end and snap on and off)
0,A solid set!
0,How cute is this! My daughter isnthe perfect blend of girly with a little bit of tom boy. And she just adored this truck!
0,First, I want to say that my natural instinct is to wince a bit at anything of the stereotypical girl toys ... my 3-year-old daughter doesn't have barbie dolls, etc.  So when it comes to remote control cars, I wouldn't have really thought about My Little Pony.		Except ... wow.  This is one of the best toys she's ever gotten.  I write a lot of reviews on Amazon, and every so often I will call one product out as being stellar ... this toy qualifies.  Easily top 5% of all the things I've reviewed here. The remote control and car is solid, and my daughter totally gets how to use it, and can effectively maneuver.  There are 3 buttons ... Go Straight, Turn Around, and Horn.  The horn is a bit gimmicky, but the other two controls have exactly the right level of responsiveness.  In the past I tried to get my daughter some remote control cars, but the ones that catered to preschoolers were real duds.  But this is a real winner.  And yeah - my daughter loves brushing the pony's hair, and she has the pony in her bed with her right now, and I find myself realizing that My Little Pony is actually a pretty awesome toy brand.  They're cool, they're girly ... and they're strong.  But, without going into a monologue on girls and girl toys, I can just say that I think this toy is perfect.
0,LOVE ALL MY POPS
0,If you're wondering about the recommended age range, this grandma writes here to tell you that two year old grandgirl loves this set. The pieces have a nice heft but not too heavy; I predict they will hold up to the toting and the dropping that goes with small hands gaining fine motor skills.  I recommend this as a dandy birthday gift for two and up.
0,This figma is awesome! I ordered my figma from "Best Anime Shop" and I got my figma in two days! They reassured me that this figma is in fact authentic and is not a bootleg. I received it today and it looks great! The only problem is that the swords are really hard to get into the hands. I accidentally broke one of the swords trying to get it in one of the hands,but it was an easy fix. I suggest this figma to any SAO/Kirito fan! Great Quality!
0,looks good..but the music is bit soft...
0,Perfect for my cube. Shuffles great.
0,Adorable and great size!
0,Wow this thing inflates and deflates in an instant! I think I fully inflate it in about 20 seconds with the included pump, and because the bottom closes with a plug (several replacement plugs are included too) deflating takes all of 5 seconds. I would say this horse is on the smaller side- just about perfect for the age range around 18 months - 2 years. You can't get much "bounce" from it because it is a bit too unstable in the base and the feet don't help keep it upright very much, but light bouncing is fine and my little boy likes to bounce and "tumble" off of it, for some reason. The ears are a little on the soft side, so there is limited use for them as a spot for kids to "hold on", but they are still usually the only place for little hands to hold onto. My kids enjoy it and I'm happy that it is easier to store than a standard sit-and-ride toy when deflated. The floor-to-seat measurement is around 10 inches.
0,As advertised
0,good
0,High quality and holds up well if standing up or tossing. I bring in the car to hand my grandson when he gets cranky. Nice size to play with toy soldiers - when the toddler gets older. Love it.
0,Love it! my little niece love it!
0,Everything in perfect condition. Thanks!
0,Kids love it.  after 3 months of casual use (1 or 2 times a week) they still stick and are easy for 2.5 year olds (we have twins) to put on and take off.  We pull out all the pages so both can use different scenes.  there's plenty of animals that are nicely designed for each page.
0,Pertaining to the card art, there are some nice looking cards in this Starter Deck Yuya.  Liked the way that the Performapals, spells cards, and trap cards work against a stronger deck.  A few additional cards makes this deck a giant killer.  It also has the pendulum cards for more summoning per turn.
0,My Grandson loved this for his B-Day
0,I purchased Noah's Ark for my little nephew, Noah, for a baptism gift.  This set is even more adorable in person.  Great quality  I am not sure Noah will have a chance to ever play with it though. His 2 1/2 year old twin sisters saw it, fell in love and took it over.  What a great hit!  Arrived quickly.  Would definitely recommend.
0,My 6 year old granddaughter loves her doll. She is so cute & even cuter in real life. Thank you.
0,Grandson enjoys playing with toy.
0,So well made !!!
0,my grandsons like to paint and draw this has worked well for arts and crafts with mommy
0,really cute and durable, my 5 year old used them for crafts after the baby shower was over, good to get extra use out of them.
0,This worked so well. Made a little boy happy.
0,Adorable! Took a bit to put it all together but once done, it was the favorited gift of the holidays.
0,Our little super reader likes playing and it's really helping with speed and accuracy of letter identification.  As long as they're already learning letters, your little one is old enough for this game.
0,Fast shipper/no issues
0,Excellent product for the price!  Kids love them!
0,Bought for my wife. Great product, puzzle cut well and fit together well. Couldn't beat the price.
0,got  this a little while ago I liked it so decided to get two more from here this card annoys my friends because creatures they control become mine when they die
0,totally awesome
0,well worth the money, my granddaughter loves them.
0,Good for the price, arrived in working condition. Looks just like the picture.
0,High quality sticker set as w all Melissa and Doug toys! Like the idea that they are reusable, but their timeline of being so depends on how much wear and tear the get. Some of the stickiness is coming off of the back of the stickers. There are so many pieces that you aren't going to miss a few pieces when that happens. Ours have been well loved and are still providing fun. Worth the price for how much time my daughter is enjoying it!
0,This is the best activity table I've come across yet.  So much fun and so much to play with!  This will surely entertain your little one.  Mine was especially fond of putting the ball down the middle and trying to guess which one it'd come out of.
0,Ever since Webkinz were a fad, my family has been a fan of both the stuffed animals and the online site. Both are fun ways for children to play, and I personally think that these animals are too cute for just children alone, and I purchase them to keep me company whilst working at my desk. This Google has the traditional unique Webkinz fur, which I can only describe as thin fuzzy fur that seems to be standing up on end, almost like someone with goosebumps. As with all Webkinz, the quality is amazing. The stitches are even and well-made. There aren't any loose parts or dangers. This Google comes with an UNUSED code which was honestly a bonus, I was just expecting the stuffed animal. It was in a clear brand-new package from the factory. I recommend this toy to anyone. I am personally a huge fan of ducks and geese, and I can't seem to collect enough toys that represent either, and this was a wonderful new addition to my collection. I purchased this Google on May 10th and received it the 15th of May- I ordered from Furniture Creations which I would recommend you all do. One of the best experiences I've had so far.
0,great for any little girl
0,My niece love it so much, she got crazy with this toy.
0,so fun! but don't play with people bu has angry issues or are easy to hold a grudge...
0,SO CUTE!! I ordered this for my husband's niece as part of her birthday gift. She loved it! It is adorable. My daughter wanted to keep it!
0,I picked this up for my 10-year-old who struggles with his emotions from time to time. This journal allows him to write down his thoughts and keep them private. The lock on it provides him with an extra sense of security. It comes with two keys, so if you lose one, you'll have another one on hand. The pages are lined and large enough for him to write on. He has pretty neat handwriting, so for kids who write large letters, the lines might be too small. Overall, it's a great journal for the price, as he is happy with it.
0,great intro game for kids just learning how to play board games.  No cards makes it easy for little kids to catch on and begin to learn strategies before having to deal with cards, money, hotels, etc.
0,I'd say the quality is what I expected, which is to say, not spectacular, but more than adequate. The "pillar" pieces are open and hollow on one side, though. I'm amazed they have four different colors of blue.
0,This is a fun craft kit for girls. The set makes a star shaped decor item whose frame snaps together. This frame is then decorated with the included string as well as little beads and gems that come in the kit. It's a fun kit but it's the all that difficult or involved. An eight year old could easily complete the project without assistance and older girls, over twelve or so, will likely become bored with it or complete the project very quickly. What I like most about the kit is that it doesn't involve glue or anything messy. It's something that can be completed on a car trip.
0,grandson should have fun with this
0,Item arrived undamaged. This item seems to live up to the hype. It cuts cleanly(very sharp) and does a very good job.	Feels good in the hand. Will be using this for all my hobby projects. May even order a spare.	Give it a try. Good luck.
0,This is a nice little figurine and I do mean little. It's heavy though, made out of metal, and is a nice pose for the dragon. The paint job isn't the greatest, thus the 4 stars.
0,Loved this pool when we first got it. I have 3 young children (under the age of 4), so it was perfect for their size. We set it up ontop of a tarp to help protect the bottom. The pool has lasted about 1 month (a little over). It gets used almost everyday for about 30+ minutes. It sits out and we refill it as the water looks dirty. There's a quick drain plug In the bottom; which is a great feature. After about 1month of use it started getting random holes in the vinyl. The first we were able to patch with the kit. The second (or more) we haven't found but it looses air within an hour of set up. We have gotten out money out of it; but it would be better if it lasted all summer.  :(
0,This may be a bit challenging for my four year old grandson but I know he'll love it anyway
0,love it!  6 month old, 3 1/2 year old and 6 1/2 year old all play with it.  Great toy!
0,I love this figure!	I hesitated to get him when I saw him in the box. But I like the outfit so I grabbed him anyway. After I took him out of the packaging, I was blown away by the details on him, just stunning. He gets a real rope on his waist, a knife in the sheath on his leg, and an unremovable bow with a real string on his nicely painted backpack. Oh I almost forgot that he gets a really nice skin tone!
0,perfect for my 3 year old.
0,grandkids love it
0,Great Experience
0,This bear is so soft and my granddaughter loved it. I bought the panda to go with a quilt I made for our grandson. Since he was newborn our granddaughter took it over. So soft and cuddly!
0,this one looks nice and has a nice quality. my boys love playing with it a lot.
0,Your basic watercolors - must have, very cute - not tooooo messy.  :)
0,My daughter and her husband are addicted to this game! It game quickly, packaged nicely. They play this for hours.
0,PANDA was bought for a gift.  Now this cuddly and loveable stuffed guy is hanging at a workplace near his favorite meal - bamboo!
0,Fun to play
0,So this toy includes the blue taller level, the gray shorter level, three mix-n-match ramps to connect the two levels to each other and to the floor, a random caution sign for decoration I guess, and two cars: Batman and the Joker. There is also a little yellow switch on the gray piece to change the flow of traffic. All of the pieces fold up inside of each other for easy storing. It's a very cute design. My son received this for Christmas a couple months before he turned two and already loved it. We would show him how to put it together, and his favorite part was taking it apart, and trying to put it together exactly how mom or dad had just situated it. In fact, now at 2 and a half years old, he still does the same thing with it more often than he actually zooms the cars around on it. I have to say over the past year this has been one of his favorite toys, and it's just so simple. No lights or annoying sounds, he somehow manages to keep all of the pieces together, and we also found that standard Hot Wheels go down this thing pretty well too, so we will have a parade of cars tour the Bat Cave every so often, teehee. So glad I stumbled across this toy trying to find something that Daddy AND tiny tot son might both find somewhat entertaining.
0,We collect all the bubble guppies and love that Nonny is finally available. Great product. Great value for any fan of the adorable guppies.
0,Very heavy and well-machined parts make this a wonderful puzzle to handle.  The solution is straight forward, making for an enjoyable piece to fidget and play with, even after solving.
0,I was surprised by the Quality. Sometimes I buy toys online and am surprised it survived shipping or its so tiny I am surprised it didn't get lost in the mail but definitely not this set. I like that the ship acts as a base kinda to keep everything. I am always looking for stuff that has a case but play doh just really doesn't come that way. Bought these for 7 and 8 year old boys and girls at a birthday party and they went over great! So cute and this isn't some tiny Play Doh play set. Great size, great gift and it is adorable for star wars fans. HIGHLY recommend for your Play doh and Star Wars fans.
0,My four-year-old granddaughter loves Frozen and has had a blast playing with this. Very happy with purchase.
0,My nephew was thrilled and you cant keep him away from it...	The product was just as described and even better.
0,Abs version with a thicker hub area. Perfect every day 3s prop
0,THis is a great investment. We have to buy new bags of sand about every month, but my kids love the sand table. Its been in our backyard over a year now, and its shown no signs of wear. A must have!
0,My four month old loves this ball. Soft and fun to play with!
0,Nice, little tent for a good price. Large enough for an adult to crawl in for some shade, but better suited for children. Our infant naps well in it and my older son uses it as a changing room on the beach. Back "window" allows for airflow and set up is a snap. Stays in place on windy beaches because it's weighted down by sand.
0,great for the monster high fan
0,Fun and pretty tough. It held up well. This is easy enough for young children to [play with, but you will need to replace batteries.
0,Bought for my son for xmas.  great little fire truck
0,My daughter loves legos, You cant really go wrong with these sets, the instructions are clear
0,As advertised.
0,Nice
0,My cousins daughter and even my son love playing with these pretty small action figures
0,Great quality for the price.  Purchased this for our 7 year old and he uses it daily.  Our 4 year old abuses it as well and it is holding up fine.
0,Very sturdy.  Our grandson loves them.
0,I love this puzzle. When you complete the puzzle, it is a great piece of artwork to frame and hang
0,great Doctor Who costume piece.
0,I am new to 3D puzzles. I confess that I was surprised that only the base was the puzzle. Having never done a 3D puzzle before I decided to use the numbers to make the puzzle. At times I felt that I need extra hands to put the puzzle together and peices seemed to pop out very easily. Once the base is built you then have extra pieces to add to go around the edges. Overall it create a nice model of the statue but it wasn't the most interesting puzzle to make just fidelity. I would say this is probably a good starter puzzle that gives you an idea of how they work and then you can try better ones later.
0,Whistles were cute, great for a goodie bag for any train-themed party.  However, whistles hardly make a sound---could be a good thing too.
0,Nice companion piece to the Disney Princess Collection.  Nice realization of the Disneyworld castle.  This was a very big hit.
0,This set is 216 pieces.  While not a huge number of pieces it is sufficient to build quite a few items without using additional Legos.  This is a great starter set or transition set from Duplos to Legos.  It would also be a great addition to a current Lego collection.		We appreciated the fun bricks included such as: wheels, a jump rope, a door, a window, flowers, a glass, a scoop of ice cream, etc.  There are also an ample number of plain bricks (including several shades of pink)included to build with.		The set comes with a hard plastic contain to store the bricks in when you are done playing.  The container is big enough that you can add more bricks with it, or easily place completed projects back in the box.
0,I purchased this for our grandson for Easter and it is adorable.  As always the Jellycat animals are so soft!  We love them and so do our grand babies!  I would definitely recommend this for anyone wanting a soft and cuddly bunny.
0,If your kid loves lights & sounds this is the space gun for him or her! My 3 year old son absolutely loves this one. Stock up on batteries though. It uses them up pretty quickly, if your kid is anything like mine, he had a perma- trigger-finger with this gun!
0,At first, I was skeptical about such cheap-looking batteries...but, after several uses, it looks like the manufacturers have built a good quality battery and just skipped on the packaging, passing the savings on to us :)		I liked it enough that I bought several more, and thankfully came across this 2-pack that's a couple of bucks cheaper: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IHA4WJK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00IHA4WJK&linkCode=as2&tag=todmedblo-20&linkId=TNYTUSXAU5GBI2IJ		I'll keep this updated as I continue to use them - one downside of cheaper batteries is that they sometimes expire faster, but this one hasn't started bulging yet, so I have high hopes		Make sure to upvote if you found this helpful!
0,My son liked it and although he is now almost 2, if asked, he would recommend you purchase it for your child.
0,Every baby loves this.
0,Total hit.  Should have bought another one.  Very cute and stable for a minecraft fan.
0,She is an adorable new addition to the Monster High series.  Ghoulia is my daughter's favorite and this doll completely embodies her.  I love the bow tie and the glasses on the design of the skirt.  Her face is really nice and her side ponytail is neatly in place.  Warning for those that open the boxes she does not come with a stand, my daughter chose to keep her in the box and has stated that this version is her favorite thus far.
0,My son thought it was cool, pretty lifelike
0,My son loves it but I did notice the wheels will come off after a while so I crazy glued them. So far so good after the crazy glue.
0,Great for daughter's collection.
0,My daughter loves it.
0,Nice size best price
0,daugthers favorite laptop
0,These are cute.
0,Grandson loved Beyblades JAPANESE Metal Fusion Starter Set #BB118 Phantom Orion.  Perfect starter set for small children to decide if they want to start collecting.
0,This was a gift & it was well received.
0,Well made. Beautiful dolls.
0,Awesome family game. May take a few games for the kids to really get it, but once they do it's super fun. Recommended for about 8+.
0,Great toy
0,This toy is a great concept. My five year old has had fun finding the different discs and using them to create his "own" song. The smart scan wand is a good size and is easy to hold and scan the discs. There are nine discs that come with this toy initially, I am hoping that Fisher-Price will come out with more discs that can be added to this game. As is it's a great starter kit but more disc options are needed for this toy to stay fun over time. Keep in mind that you will need 3 AAA batteries (not included).
0,My grandson who are 8 loved this Xmas gift
0,A good handful of plastic cockroaches make a funny gag gift. I bought them for my son who loves bugs. But these things stink! They had a strong plastic chemical smell. I guess they were trying to mimic a real cockroach? Although I've never smelled a real cockroaches scent...These fake ones smelled horrible.
0,buy to my son's pinewood derby car, he ended up keeping this guy and using a Superman that came with a set. this Superman has two faces.
0,cute
0,This was one of 3 Minnie Mouse sets purchased for my niece and I couldn't say enough night things.  Both large pieces fit into a large tote (one measures 11x18x4 and the other measures 10x3x8 and there is still room to add on to the sets.  All the kids love to play with this set, they are between the ages and 2 and 8 and can all manipulate and dress the characters.
0,This game has quickly entered our top rotation of Euro games.  The fact that this game combines several different mechanics and contains a wide variety of cards helps to lend massive replay value.  This isn't a game that gets stale after a dozen plays.		Basically you are trying to build a long haul galaxy shipping vehicle and beat the other opponents to the goods.  There is a wonderful humorous side to the game as well: you might be fending off asteroids or space pirates and losing chunks of your ship - or watching the same happen to your opponents.		A few reviewers have said this and I will restate this: do not buy this game if you love winning.  Buy this game if you love playing the game and are okay with a random accident ruining your chances to win.  It's so fun that it doesn't really matter who wins.  And if you do win it's really based a little on skill and a lot on luck.  But it makes the game immensely fun and funny.		I cannot recommend this enough!		**Also in tier one rotation (as of time of review) and personally recommended: Isle of Skye, King of Tokyo, Firefly Fluxx, Carcassonne (always), San Juan, Smallworld, Morels.
0,So cute and it is a signature as my granddaughter said!!
0,Such a happy student!  so excited, very durable and perfect fit for a 3 - 4 year old.
0,this skye pillow pet is amazing. my daughter is so happy to have opened this gift to her. shes a big paw patrol lover, and honestly I love the values they teach to her too. skye is a fearless flyer and always willing to help. this pillow pet is a great toy/pillow. the pillow is very plush and soft material, there is nothing abrasive or uncomfortable to lay on (unless you lay flat on the Velcro piece, but even it has a fabric cover to lay on top when not in pet form so you don't get scratched.) the stitching is great, no loose threads, holes or anything to ruin the integrity of this toy. my daughter has enjoyed this pillow and been taking it everywhere as well as sleeping with it. shes also repeating skye's catchphrase "take to the sky" often, as she plays with the pet. As a parent- I'm also a big fan of how easy its been to clean this pillow, as you can imagine how dirty something gets when a 3 year old plays with it constantly. I received this pillow pet for a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
0,We ordered several of these kits for our kids. For our 8 year old daughter, they were a little complex but she was able to follow along with some of the instructions and just needed a little help from time to time. Our 10 year old daughter was able to read almost all of the directions for herself and had a fully functional device. The vehicle part was fun, but the building was really the emphasis for her. They move well on our hard wood floors, but less so on the carpeted areas, which is typical of motorized cars. She thoroughly enjoyed the building process. I'm impressed that they could put together a kit with clear enough instructions for her to do independently. That is was really "made" this for her.
0,a+
0,The only real complaint i have with this figuarts, if is you replace his normal right arm for his armored on one. Its hard to get the new arm to stay in place. Either then that this figuart is amazing. I love this figure, and greatly enjoy having him in my collection. Can't wait to get the rest of the Kyoryu Team.		Not meant for children as it is to a toy. The S.H. Figuart line are meant only for display. Please do not by for a small child as they do come with small parts, and sharp parts. Great for Collectors.
0,What a wonderful different toy for a 4 month old and older.	My Two year old Granddaughter played with this for almost a hour,  and also my 1 year old Grandson, found this very	intriguing , as he moved around the beads through the Maze.	Also since she is two she is bossy, so the one year just went to the other side of the toy to play.		From any angle all around the child has something to do with bright colors, and beads.	The beads go all through the curly thick colored wires , up, down, in circles. Little flowers that move.		I would not let a child use this to try and stand up, it will topple over. But you do not	have to put the tree type bottom on, and the child can sit and play.		Its All wood, and such nice craftsmanship. I think this is a special toy, that is Not plastic from China.	This toy will be  handed down in my family for the other children to enjoy		This also makes a very nice baby shower gift, or when you go see a new special baby. ( it is a bit pricey).	Its is Bigger and heavier then I expected.		I recommend this toy,
0,So happy that Playmobil has a line for the younger child.  Our 3 year old grandson is not ready for the other Playmobil sets with tiny parts, so this toy is great.  He really enjoys playing with it.
0,Great learning tool.
0,This was a perfect buy for us. I searched high and low for the best kitchen. My budget was $100.00  but after weighing the pros and cons of this one vs countless others, I decided it was worth the extra $40 and went ahead with the purchase. I'm so glad I did! I have two kids, five and one. I needed something tall enough for the oldest but not overly tall for the youngest. I also wanted something that made noise and something that was wide enough that they both could play at the same time. This was it! It came in two boxes and was easy enough to put together. We did have to drill holes for the screws ourselves, but I knew I would have to from reading previous reviews. I do find it funny that the instructions call for a simple screwdriver. That would never work, you need a drill, for sure. But, even before we drilled all the screws in, I put it together and let the kids play with it until dad got home with the tools. The only thing that was easy to detach was the sink, everything else stays together fairly well even without the screws. This set is great and the kids love when the pans bubbly and sizzle. Definitely worth the extra $40. And with the sturdiness of it, I think we are in for years of fun with this. Thanks Step2!
0,I really did not buy many vtech toys but when my daughter won an award for goob behavior I decided to buy her a camera and take her to the Earth Day Celebration to help me take pictures.  I thought I would just get the fisher price tough kids camera since I had seen so many adds for that one.  Upon reading about the two camera's I decided that the Vtech kidizoom sounded like a better value since it also had built in video games (how good is that in the car).  Well it was easy to use right out the package, had two cute games, had a nice big viewing screen and dropping it was not a problem-very durable.  The download was easy and it had fun editing software right in the camera-no downloading from CD's.  My daughter had a great time taking pictures of schoolmates with me at the festival. I would recommend this camera by all means.  It is great!		Val Ford
0,My daughter was shocked when this dresses arrived. She was so excited to wear it for Halloween but (between her and my youngest) it has been worn practically every day since then and it is still in great shape 3 1/2 months later even though they are pretty tough on it. It's a beautiful gown and the cape is a huge hit. I highly recommend it.
0,Grandson loved it.
0,Exactly what we wanted.  Great gift!
0,Very handy
0,This is a good matching game for kids who like Doc McStuffins. I bought it for a two-year-old family member for Christmas and she seems to enjoy it. It's just your basic matching game with Doc McStuffins characters. Good quality, vibrant pictures.
0,Of course a needed birthday girl accessory!
0,Very cute! It is a gift for my niece who LOVES Elsa. The material seems of good quality and I didn't notice any imperfections in the dress itself. The diamond snowflake is centered and not as wrinkled as I expected. The wrinkles come over very easily with some steam.
0,My daughter's aunt and uncle have gotten her a different LeapFrog Violet gift for every special occasion we've had so far. She has&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/LeapFrog-My-Pal-Violet/dp/B001W35I8I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">LeapFrog My Pal Violet</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/LeapFrog-Chat-And-Count-Cell-Phone-Violet/dp/B004MWN0MC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">LeapFrog Chat And Count Cell Phone, Violet</a>&nbsp;and now this tablet. We also have Tag Junior and 3 Tag Junior books but those were from a friend. We love Violet and LeapFrog products so we were excited about the tablet.		She got this for Christmas and at 15 months she was more interested in some of her other toys at first. She got so many toys for Christmas that we put a lot of them away for a while so she wouldn't get overwhelmed. This was one toy that she didn't seem ready for so we put it in her closet for about 3 weeks. Then we started giving this to her to play with in the car, since we like to save most of her things that talk and light up for car rides, and have her play with toys that require more creativity and activity at home. At first she got frustrated with it because Violet says to press certain buttons in order to make different things happen. She didn't understand that and I had to show her how to do it a few times before she got the hang of it. Now (at almost 18 months old) she knows how to push the buttons to "read email" and hear stories. Her favorite is alphabet mode. She loves pushing each letter and hearing the sounds. Her favorite letters are E, G, S, F, and I for some reason. She pushes those over and over and over. I hope she doesn't get tired of it anytime soon because this is one of the few toys she enjoys playing with on car rides.		Customization is easy, like other LeapFrog toys. I wish that customizing email messages was better and you could write a longer, more personal message. I do like being able to pick the songs and stories, but I do wish there was a larger variety to choose from.		Like My Pal Violet, you can customize the child's name, favorite color, food, and animal. The customizations are worked into the stories, songs, etc.		Violet can spell and say the name. When in Alphabet mode and the first letter of the child's name is pressed Violet says, "That's the first letter of your name! Let's celebrate your letter!" and then some music plays. Also in Alphabet mode the child pushes a letter button to hear the sound the letter makes (including both the long and short sounds for vowels) and then a couple of words that start with that letter. So if the letter K is pushed, a male voice says, "K says (k sound)" and then Violet says, "As in, Karate Kick! Hiyah!" and then there's a little animation to go with it.		You can choose 5 out of 10 stories for Storytime mode. All are pretty short and include the voices of the different LeapFrog animals (Violet, Scout, and whatever the cat and hamster are named). In Story mode you can hear the stories you picked. After each "page" you are supposed to push the arrow buttons to turn the "pages" but if the child doesn't push the button it will keep playing. (Good for if your child is like mine and forgets how to use the tablet if I'm not sitting there helping her) There are animations all along the way, so really its more like a cartoon than a book. Sometimes a female voice "reads" the story, or its just a cartoon of the LeapFrog characters playing or doing whatever.		You can save 3 customized emails with short messages. You can choose from a list of messages and various relatives' names. This is in addition to the messages the child can receive from Violet. The child also gets to "reply" to messages. Sometimes. After you read a message Violet says, "Let's reply to it" and then it crafts a response saying something like, "Dear Daddy, I love you so much. Love, Kid's Name." If you push the envelope button it takes you to Email/Messages and Notes. If you choose Email the child gets to hear a message from Violet or one of the customized messages, sometimes getting to reply. If you go to the notebook it takes you to Notes mode, and the child pushes buttons to "write" a story or message of their own. When you press the paw button Violet says, "What a great story!" and that's it. I  wish that Violet would read what the child wrote, if it was a real word, and maybe have the option of saving the messages and printing them out when the tablet is plugged in to the computer.		In Music mode you can choose to listen to music or play music. The music note plays the songs you pick while an animation of Violet dancing is on the screen. The keyboard allows you to make your own music. Each letter button is a different sound effect with accompanying animation. The top row plays silly sounds and animal noises and a wiggly, swirly line dances to the sound. The middle row plays percussion noises such as clapping hands, cymbals, and bongos while Violet plays the drums. The bottom row is all piano sounds and Violet plays the piano. During customization you can choose 4 songs with vocals, and 5 instrumental songs. There is a mix of traditional toddler/preschooler tunes such as "Do You Know The Muffin Man" and "Row, Row, Row Your Boat" as well as classical music from Beethoven, Brahms, and Mozart. They are mostly the same selections you get with My Pal Violet, so we try to choose ones that aren't on her My Pal Violet so she gets to hear different songs with each toy. Her favorites are "If You're Happy and You Know it" and "Itsy Bitsy Spider".		The LeapFrog character buttons talk when you push them. I think they each say a couple of different things.		The tablet is easy to hold and the buttons are easy to push. The toy itself is very easy to clean and disinfect with a Lysol wipe.		Compared to a lot of her other toys, the battery life is pretty long. The batteries it came with straight from the store lasted 3 months with us, and who knows how many people played with it before it got to our house. It takes 3 AA batteries (unlike several of her other toys that take hard to find/expensive batteries) and the compartment screws on with a single, standard sized, Phillips head screw.		The USB port is protected by a wall of plastic, which helps protect it against crumbs or sticky juice or whatever toddlers/preschoolers have on their hands at any given time.		The tablet is quite sturdy. Its been thrown and kicked on several occasions and has very minor scratches. It still is shiny and new and there has been no damage to the buttons. The tablet functions properly in spite of the abuse it has gone through.		The buttons are easy for little fingers to push. They don't stick out so crumbs and whatever can't get inside and gunk it up.		Overall I am thrilled with it and so is my daughter.
0,Excellent party favor. We had a car theme party & gave these to the kids as a favor. Cute car banks that come with their own set of paints & stickers. Big enough for a few dollars worth of change.
0,Adorable and soft. Great gift for my daughter.
0,My daughter got a ton of gifts for her third birthday but this was her favorite by far! She is obsessed. She takes Thomas everywhere! Loves this toy so much.
0,Christmas gift
0,This toy is so cute and baby loves it.  Amazon had a better price than other retailers, and fast shipping made sure it arrived in time for Christmas.  The bear is not particularly "cuddly" because of the metal frame for the "peek-a-boo" movement, but it's really cute and entertaining for a little one.
0,My daughter was very pleased with all her Shopkin stuff from Santa, Santa was very pleased with the prices on Amazon vs. the stores. Thanks for a great Christmas
0,What a lot of fun the kids had with this
0,I absolutely love this game. I've seen the original played, but never played it myself. Got this one for the extra elements added since the original game (stations, tunnels, etc). Pretty easy to learn and play. This version has a little more strategy compared to the original which is why I chose this one over Ticket to Ride. Definitely deserves a spot on your shelf.
0,My kids seem to love these. A bit too easy for me, with only 1-3 steps to transform, but I think my kids like the fact that they can do it all by themselves. We'll be moving to something more challenging soon.
0,I bought this for my 6 month old and he loves it sooo much. There are three different settings to play. ABC/123 learning so when you hit the buttons he says a couple letters and numbers, then there is music and play mode. I can just put my 6 month old down on the floor and set this toy in front of him and he goes crazy hitting the buttons and cranking the crank on the drill. it also comes with a hammer you can take off. It is a great toy and i wish i can find more like this. I highly recommend it!!		Update 11 months later and still amazing	I bought this toy for my son when he was about 6 months old. He loved pressing on the drill handle to see it spin around and make noise. Now at 17 months old he is more aware of how to play with the toy, he will actually change this toy to the music setting hisself so it will sing to him. He knows what each button does and which buttons sings to him. Very great hand eye coordination learning toy!
0,Tsuro but a little longer and a little deeper and yes better.  I still love those Tsuro components
0,Used these for Halloween, they are exactly as described, Very happy.
0,Perfect for your kid or dog/ cat haha!
0,cool
0,We bought these for our sons "montessori inspired" nursery.  They are perfect on the shelf, durable to play with, paint hasn't chipped with teething and frankly, very attractive.  I feel like a magazine Mom with these toys on his shelf - HA!
0,Love it!
0,Grandson loves playing with this. A gift from his new baby sister to him. He had another nabi, but it got broke. So he loves having a new one. Highly recommend for playing games and education. We all have iPads, so grandson thinks he has one also. Highly recommend. Prompt delivery.
0,Happy Child!
0,Very happy w/this colored pencil set.  Arrived very fast.
0,I have a three-year-old, five-year-old, two seven-year-olds and a fourteen-year-old daughter and as a group activity and appropriate supervision all of them loved this Barbie airbrush designer--I would not recommend this as a solo activity for younger children but as part of a group it worked out fine.  Everyone loved trying out the airbrush unit and creating their own patterns on the Barbie clothes.  The best part is that if the kids want to create new patterns you can just wash out the clothes and start all over again.  A great group craft activity that has the bonus of including Barbie dress-up as part of the fun.
0,my grandson is a big yugioh fan and this made him so happy! He is six and is teaching me how to battle the monsters against each other. Things that stretch his imagination and give him fantasy play are all right by me! It gives us something extra to fill our time together when he is visiting! Great stuff, excellent seller!
0,kids loved it
0,It's really helpful to have a base plate when putting together all those little Lego collections. My daughter set up several of the little Friends animal home sets on this one, so she had a little animal neighborhood.
0,It was quite awesome.  It looks just like the anime, and has all the rules shown in the show.
0,This is a really fun lighter strategy game. I say "strategy" because compared to monopoly and uno, this game offers much better choices and fun upgrades while pounding your opponents into submission. If that sounds violent, that's because IT IS! BAM! WHACK! POW! OOF! ZAP! It's actually not too bad. My nephews like it and it's one of the few games they seemed to enjoy that I actually also enjoy. If you're an serious board game strategist then this will seem like a filler game to you, and the key to enjoying it would be to not care about how random it is or whether or not your perfect strategist mind is perfectly engaged, expecting this game to pefectly execute your perfect strategy. Get over yourself. Not everything in life bends itself to your perfect plans. In fact, in any sort of warfare or combat experience when are things fair or go exactly according to plan? Not that I'm a veteran or anything but come on, live a little. Anyway this game is pretty neat.
0,We have really enjoyed this vegetable set!  It's very realistic and durable. The veggies were a little stinky when we first opened the box but that went away after a quick dish soap wash. I would definitely recommend this product!
0,This moose is so cute!  Larger than what I had thought it would be.  Hangs on car seat, stroller, pack n play.  The colors are bright and baby loves to grab onto it.
0,Anyone in the hobby knows that MIP makes the best drivers in the industry. Period! I've used PB Swiss, Wiha, and about half a dozen others. Nothing compares to the hardness and durability of the MIPs. Forget those other hobby branded sets by Integy, etc. Get yourself a set of MIPs and you will never need another driver.		I recently tried to take the threaded portion out of some pushrods. They were glued in there with some industrial adhesive. I had a PB Swiss on one end and my MIP driver on the other. The first PB Swiss started to turn inside the handle so it became useless. I then grabbed a PB Swiss bit with a wrench to hold it in place. The tip snapped off. My MIP never wavered, never failed. Why would you want to use anything else.
0,I purchased this for my daughter when she was a newborn. She loved to stare at it and once she was more inclined, it became a great noise maker and later teether. The picture is accurate for color. However I will note it's fairly good sized. On her infant carrier, it took up most of the span of the bar and majority of the area between my daughter and the bar. The material wipes clean easily. Overall a great product and durable- I would recommend for any infant/baby.
0,Sailor Saturn has came and I love her! She's so tiny compared to the others and just so beautiful! Very happy with this
0,I bought this for my 9 month old son and he absolutely loves it! Out of all of his toys (and trust me he has too many lol) he plays with this the most! Now that he's pulling up, all he wants to do is stand to play so this toy is perfect! I would definitely recommend this! It has different settings so that it can play music and also teach colors and shapes, etc.
0,For a toy that encourages and entertains kids this is all hands down a hit with the kids. Several kids including nieces and nephews all have their own "straw builder" set they liked it so much. It entertains kids for hours and hours. And the things that they build is mind blowing from forts to high rises, etc. The 720 piece set is the only way to go and technically you probably need two of these about 1400 pieces to really go all out and especially if you have more than one child playing at the same time. I also took several straws and cut them in half to make smaller pieces as all the kids ended up using them. One nephew actually made a motorcycle with a helmet with these straws. Yep, a motorcycle. He had no help and did it straight off of imagination. Seen the kids build Eiffel towers, army forts, bow and arrows, houses, etc. There really isn't anything they can't make and both girls and boys love it. It is just not boys the girls love making things too. Out of all the toys I have bought this is the only one I have seen that captivates them that is not an Xbox. I would say for 10 and under would be the age I would suggest this for. Note: One of my nephews is not really creative and he still had fun playing with and building with the straws. He built army forts, etc. so really it is for all types of kids from what I have personally witnessed.
0,Good quality. My 6-year-old loves them.
0,The kids really liked it
0,Packaging was awful to get everything out but my 7 year old daughter loves this. Great with her American Girl dolls and so much more affordable than that brand.
0,These are so cool!  They actually crunch a little.  The down side is that they pick up hair and dirt like crazy.  If you have a pet, be prepared for some hairy snowballs.
0,Cute
0,Fun game. Great for parties!
0,This is great for any child. I purchased two of these and both of my grandchildren love it! The tool box that is on the trailer is great and both of them enjoyed turning the screws to take it apart and then screw things back together. This practical toy encourages children to begin to learn how to take things apart and then put back together. We need to encourage that in our children these days that they can "fix" things...
0,Fun! Had to super glue some parts on, but my 4 year old loves it!
0,As far as kid games go, this is not my favorite. However, my daughter loves it. The gems are hard for her to take off the crown and bracelet at the end. I think that this game is something she will only want to play a handful of times. I was able to buy this as a lightening deal. However, I'm not sure I would have paid full price for it.
0,Great toy for the kids.
0,Very fun game. Quick to learn. Fun to master
0,Great job. Thank you!
0,Adorables!
0,My daughter got me this. I am tall and not a skinny model....it is wonderful...very roomy and comfy......blowing it up took a bit but if you use a pump, would be seconds.....but i love it......good balancing, you don't fall over.....if i can use this at age 65, anyone can......it is adult size.....just noticed the price....	 cheaper in stores as Walmart or Ocean State Job Lot.....$4 to $5
0,These shipped quickly and it they have brought hours of fun to my grandson.
0,I loved the idea, but haven't heard yet if my 6 year old grandson has done it.
0,love it
0,My 3 years old daughter loves them. They r a good bit of size. I thaught they were smaller than they are. But they r perfect size. Thank u
0,Great quality! I love Green Toys!
0,Just as described!
0,the product was defective but it was refunded by the seller. Thanks
0,We got this for my 4 year old nephew for Christmas. He has taken it apart and put it back together several times by himself.
0,Excellent item for creative kids!
0,We love these. Everything about these is fun. Building them is almost as much fun as flying them. Super cool birthday activity.
0,My 6 year old really enjoyed this game...It managed to keep his attention and his favorite was navigating his way through the mazes. This consists of 24 levels which gets a little bit harder the higher you go. This focuses on problem solving, strategy and puzzles with a little bit of creativity added. This is most defiantly a learning game which is a plus.
0,Great toy!
0,My daughter loves this for her nerf "wars" and holds her cell phone and keeps it protected during their little battles. I was a bit reluctant to let her use her cell phone for this but its made well and at almost 13 they are still playing outside and having fun..... I am all for it! :)
0,The slip in sheets are wonderful for working on different writing skills.		The board cleans easily enough and my daughter loves to work with this.
0,I love the cell phone. Very realistic and I like that the barbie can hold it.
0,Very pretty, my daughter loved it
0,Gave as a gift
0,I really love how wonderful and detailed this one is. Awesome job on her hair and the fire effects. Either Sailormoon or Sailor Mars fans should definitely get this.
0,Daughter loves this set!
0,big fun in the tub thanks
0,My toddler loves this toy. However, I don't feel the hammer part of the toy is safe, so I don't use this part of it.
0,I like these magnets for our white board. My toddler enjoys moving the numbers around to corresponding numbered drawings. Somehow, he did manage to get the magnets off the back of a few within milliseconds? So that's something to watch out for if you are using this with tots or have younger kids around. He uses this with supervision.
0,Great and beauty product!!!
0,Great price, arrived quick, and as expected
0,just as described
0,This is definitely a one on one teaching aid.  The cards aren't an ideal size for group teaching.  The fact that 17 languages are included is truly great.  The pictures are colorful and will certainly capture the child's attention.  This is indeed a great learning aid and I certainly recommend it for use with your children.
0,Such a fun and simple preschool game! My students love it and it only takes a couple minutes to play, which is perfect for the 3-year-olds in my class! They line up to have a turn with it during play time!
0,Nothing fancy here, just a plain old black playmate. It will hold my cards in place while I play. I read a review from another poster that this can be used as a backdrop. Maybe use it for my eBay listings.
0,This was a gift for my 3yr old granddaughter who be playing soccer in a "mini" league this year. "Frozen" is her absolute favorite right now so when she saw this she was ecstatic. The ball seems well made and is very colorful. Very satisfied with this purchase and would recommend it highly.
0,Grandkids love the Octonauts and these puzzles.
0,luv them
0,Great little cube!  My son loves it, he couldn't put it down for a week until he learned how to solve it quickly.  He had an official Rubiks cube but it was slow and stiff.  This cube really motivated him to practice.
0,I was born in the 80's and loved the first couple seasons of Power Rangers as a kid. I always wanted an accurate power morpher (even as a kid I wanted props more than figures) but they were so hard to find in my area. Fast forward a couple decades and Bandai has reproduced the props in extreme detail. Sure, the sound effects and music are unnecessary but they add something for anyone who wants these as a toy instead of a display. The item has a nice weight to it and includes all accessories one would expect given a familiarity with the source material.
0,This was a fun set for my 6 year old to put together.  He loves trucks and cars and tow trucks.
0,My grandson loves this! Very cute!
0,My 10 year old son loved receiving it for Christmas this year and we enjoyed the time we spend putting it together. It does require some adult help if this is your child's first time working with something like this. You will enjoy this if finessing things together is not an issue for you. The parts do require careful attention as you put them together as the spec tolerances are not as closely managed as you would find with say lego parts. When completed and tuned it worked nicely and we had a lot of fun working on it together. I would buy at again
0,I got this for my 8-year-old nephew.  It was more about the process of building it than playing with it.  Plus, it's a dinosaur; he was hooked from the time he opened it!  He loves puzzles and this was a really engaging one for him.  It gives him something to do indoors, especially in the coming colder months.
0,It was better than expected. My son is a little afraid of it still. He just turned 3.
0,Can't wait to grow these there is  100% satisfaction on this item ...no brainier.  Fast shipping thank you!
0,my daughter loved this cute kitty, she lost a cat that looked similer to this so she holds it dear to her heart
0,Cute, soft and cuddly. Mom-to-Be Loved it and want to keep it for herself.
0,Excellent.
0,For a 4-inch figure this is not a bad representation of one of the power rangers' most powerful foes. It has show accuracy, it's rich in color, and it will make a great addition to any child's epic toy adventures or collector's display case. Plus it comes with a power card to boost your Power Rangers Action Card Game collection. Definitely worth picking up.
0,This is a very well made dress. Even zips up the back; not velcro.		So nice that these clothes are offered so affordably without sacrificing quality.
0,This is fun, but do not, repeat...DO NOT, buy this version to play with younger kids.  And do not try to play with anyone who does not have a sense of humor and is easily offended as the cards have some pretty raunchy statements on them.  Rather fast moving game.
0,My two year old could reload all by himself.
0,He was Sick on Christmas Day! So he wasn't able to ride it until the day after and his parents weren't sure he was going to be tall enough, but he streched out and could reach the pedals and off he rode in a blizzard of bunny dust.
0,just what i needed for my collection
0,nice looking pup and the color change is cool, my son loves this at night time
0,My kiddos love Frozen and this playdough set was very fun for them to play. What I like best of all was that it was very user/kid friendly. Sven is easy to use rolling over the dough and Olaf was simple enough to smash together to make
0,Grad kids loved them
0,Happy grandson
0,OK!
0,Good quality. No imperfections.
0,Excellent
0,Got to me on time and it was a brand new minifigure. Opened but still in great conditions.
0,This is our first Mario K'nex set, and I have to say I'm really impressed.  It comes with 518 pieces for around $50. Considering the high cost of Legos, this really felt like a bargain to me.  The set is pretty complex and while I can imagine younger children having a very difficult time putting this together (not just for the complexity, but the tiny pieces), older children should find the challenge fun.  There's a lot of variety and a lot of moving pieces to the set and I had no trouble putting it together or changing it around.  My son can't quit playing with this set.  I really like it.  Should I encounter durability problems (which I don't foresee)I will be happy to update my review, but for now I can't recommend it enough and feel like it's a bargain.		I also wanted to add (since I forgot to at the time), that you shouldn't worry about the number of stickers that accompany this set.  Yes, there are around a dozen or so large decals, but they are enormously easy to apply.  The pieces they attach to have holes in them which prevents bubbling and I'm not sure if it's also attributable to the holes or not, but the stickers apply very easily.  Finally, I will say that after some time, my son has removed the boos and has just been using them as stand alone action figures instead of enjoying the set as a whole.  There's a little stand alone golf type thing in which you catapult the Mario figure towards the flag and he still plays with that. But overall and after time, the set has lost a bit of his interest.  I'm still happy with the overall product, and stand by my positive review.
0,Purchased for grandson on 1st birthday.  He (and his older sibs) loved it right away. The blocks are easy to hold and snap together for small hands. The wagon offers extra intrique for carrying blocks and other items. Picking up the blocks as it drives over is just "magic"! I would highly recommend this product to any one purchasing for a small child.
0,Thanks!
0,Fast delivery! I opened the package to see if everything was in there and it's almost impossible to fit it back in, but it's all there. I'm not sure if there will be enough connector pieces but the contents are as promised.
0,We loved this game.  We figured it out after playing it once.
0,Very pleased with it
0,My children LOVE these stars!  They are a great big size which makes them extra cool for my little ones.  They love, love, love, them!  My husband hung them with string with the included putty and they all fell.  But, I'm not positive it was the putty's fault.  He would lift up our 3 year old and she would stick them up herself.  So that may have been the problem. lol		I still used a different brand's putty and I stuck them flat on the ceiling.  I just think seeing them hang even 1/2 inch would drive me nuts after a while, visually.  So I can say that the included putty was easy to scrape off and did not leave a mark.		We used these stars with the 3-d solar system in the other room and they look great.  the stars included with that set are poor, so I am happy I used these. I hung those planets about 1.5 inches from the ceiling. lol.		I cannot really review how long the stars glow.  I don't expect them to be a night light.  I just know they glow brightly.
0,Great product!
0,Legos are always a huge hit, but this was even better!! My daughter had an absolute blast putting this together. Highly recommend!
0,Good size and hard to miss the value of the card.
0,Bought these for our Toy Story themed bday party. Tied some to fishing line and had them coming down the stairwell, across the ceiling and "repelling" on to the food table. Also got "The Claw Candy Toy Grabber Machine w/ LED Lights" on here and filled it up with these soldiers (there are a ton in the bag). Toy soldiers worked awesome in the grabber machine. Had a line at this game all through the party.
0,A must have product, same quality as the original one.
0,Great addition to original Kanoodle.  Loads of 3-d puzzles, which is why I bought it.  Play on a level surface..  The noodles are slippery.
0,For the price these are great. My son loves them. You can't see far with them, but for little explorers they are fun.

0,The best laser tag game set in the market. Unlike traditional wearable target sensors, having the sensors around the tip and the sides of the gun blasters prevent players from cheating. The players also naturally become vulnerable when shooting at others.
0,My three year old daughter absolutely LOVES this barbie.  She loves changing the clothes and the shoes.  There is a lot of variety in the outfits.  Great toy!
0,Bought for my grand daughter who is almost two and she absolutely loved it!!  Made me a rockstar grandpa!!
0,Quick.  Fills the bill
0,Great toy from a great company.  Made in the US from recycled bottles!  Fun for little ones!
0,My one year old loves the Go! Go! Smart Wheels vehicles! He is too little to enjoy all of the tracks and stations but he loved to play with the vehicles and dance to the songs. For a talking toy they are not annoying (although my husband and I do find ourselves singing the songs all day.)
0,A friend of mine had this for her kids years ago, and I was so excited to find it! My kids LOVE this. It has a volume control so it isn't real obnoxious. It says the letter and sound in a sing song kind of way that keeps the kids attention. Plus sings the ABC song and Wheels on the bus. Seems pretty durable it's been dropped about 1/2 dozen times already and it's still working!
0,Very happy granddaughter...thank you!
0,Awesome math toy. My 5 year old son started doing addition and subtraction with ease using this.
0,I bought these for my 2.5 year old in November and gave it to him not even a month ago and my 5 year old has commendeered it and played with it everyday since its arrival. Mommy has definite wear and tear since she is the most played with. They like the baby but the mommy repeats up to 10 seconds whenever you press the button on her chest and she says it different and sassy. I will post pics to show mommy a wear and tear. She's missing fur already baby's ok but he's not played with as much. I feel like it's been a good purchase they both still work great and everything I worried about such as them ripping the wings off haven't been an issue my boys really like it. Note: The dents in the moms eye brows are from where she has been dropped
0,Very cute magic trick. My 10yr old loved it. She had a magician come for her birthday and was very excited to be able to perform this trick. It's easy to use. Very simple but cute and fun for my daughter.
0,Love that this is waterproof! Holds up well
0,good
0,I love anything STRC. The products are top notch all the way. I bought these for my stampede because stock plastic ones broke. Worth the $ all the way!
0,The product arrived in the expected time. Its packaging has nothing bent or broken. The product was tested and works perfectly. My only annoyance is in handling the boxes in the mail. In several orders I have made have come battered. I suggest adding air pockets to cushion those blows.
0,On time, as ordered and easy to put together. In reality it does not weight that much assembled, so following some other reviews, I mounted it to a frame made of landscape timbers. I build the frame, taking measurements from the assembled ship. Placed the frame on a bed of drainage rock then fastened the ship to the frame with 2" angle pieces. Then filled it with sand.	Prior to this, I had also sprayed the assembled ship with waterproofing as it will be outdoors (covered in the winter) its entire life.	Grandkids were absolutely thrilled.
0,Awesome toys, great quality.
0,A great chalkboard.  Large area, no wasted space.  Thick metal, had extra mounting hardware in case a screw fell under the play area.  Used a competitors on my other grand-children's play structure, and it is smaller and has more wasted space.  This is much better than that one
0,Your kiddo will be the envy of the sandbox with this cool cement mixer. Its bright, durable, and very well-made. Best feature by far is the rotating cement mixer that moves via easy crank. The cab also opens and closes, and the truck comes with a "little people" style driver.		The truck is well sized (perfect for toddlers or younger children), and is simple enough that it encourages imaginative play. Best of all, it is SILENT and does not require any batteries. Brilliant!
0,A great buy. It's very nicely detailed and the glossy coat adds a slightly slimy look. Another great statue bank that will make an amazing bookend once weighed down.
0,Great Price - Fast Delivery
0,When I found out that Bandai(Japan) was making new vinyl figures for Legendary Pictures' film, I was thoroughly excited; Bandai hadn't produced new Godzilla vinyl figures since 2007. Now that I finally purchased this figure and beheld it firsthand, I can say that it doesn't disappoint.	Bandai's sculptors were at their A game producing this figure. Every detail on Godzilla's scaly, armored skin has been recreated faithfully. Godzilla's head may appear a little too small, but that makes the level of detail achieved all the more impressive. There is no paint slop anywhere on the figure; even his beady orange eyes are precisely colored. Godzilla is primarily a matte charcoal grey all over, with a light muddy brown wash on his claws and underbelly. oddly the wash stops halfway down his tail, but given its position on the figure, it's not too bad of an eyesore.	Articulation is present at its basics in the shoulders, hips, and tail - although Godzilla's tail is more oblong than round in circumference, so the articulation is somewhat negated. However, articulation should not be one's aim when purchasing this figure. For a standard Godzilla "kid's toy" by Bandai, this is perfectly acceptable.	While I said that this figure does not disappoint, I do admit I was surprised by the scale. Godzilla is actually a quarter-inch short of six inches, and while that may sound trivial, it makes a big difference for the figure's overall mass. It's ironic, but Bandai's figure of the biggest Godzilla to date may be one of their smaller figures of the monster king. The figure does make up for that in length, though: Godzilla is ten and a half inches long from toe to tail-tip, rivaling my otherwise larger Godzilla 2000 figure.	All in all, Bandai's six-inch Godzilla 2014 may not be a truly perfect figure, but it's fine entry to the Movie Monster line, and a figure worthy of any Godzilla fans collection. This figure comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
0,Bought this for my grand daughter who loves to color on this; best thing is she can't color on anything else!
0,Had one of these with both of my kids and they love it!!
0,Ah Salty! The dockside diesel! The crash and repair feature is cool.. only issue is the sticker was peeling as soon as we saw his sides open up. Other than that, we love him:)
0,I bought these for a ball pit (aka a blow- up swimming pool) for my baby for Christmas.  He loves them.  100 is just enough for the VERY SMALL pool.  Anything bigger (like a play pen) you'll need a couple hundred more balls!  They are indeed crush-proof as well.
0,got it for my daughters birthday party to decorate, the quality is great
0,This Beagle is very soft. It is a webkinz toy. I love it. I got it to be able to play with my grandkids,at the webkinz site on the computer. We have a lot of fun.
0,Was happy with the box's condition, the delivery time, & definitely happy to add him to my other Marvels'! Thanks!
0,Like it. Delivered promptly.
0,My 5 year old grandson loves this transformer.  Some transformers I have seen would be hard for a 5 year old.  He had nor trouble with this one.  He has played with it for hours.  It is a could quality nicely constructed toy.
0,My daughter loves her little camera.  The day she received it she figured everything out on it.  The kids will run around the house taking pictures of everything and then sit in the bathroom with the lights off and watch the little show of pictures that they just took.  The only downside to this camera is it does seem to eat through batteries like no tomorrow.  Other than that it's awesome to watch them make their own little shows and play nicely together.
0,Adorable, just like the picture. Very good quality. Will be a Christmas present.
0,Excelente producto.
0,Excellent product for the money.  The rockets go farther up in the air than I expected.  Young and old are entertained.

0,Lego's are very popular in our home and so is Star Wars, so this was perfect for my 8 yr old boys.  It kept them occupied for hours and was cheaper here than at the local stores

0,Great and detailed if you are okay with paying Lego prices. Arrived when expected and had no need to return.
0,Yes, this makes a huge mess.  As you chip away at the block, it falls apart in large sand-like pieces that bounce and end up everywhere.  The block is very hard and holds together well until they start chipping away at it.  Kit includes a real metal hammer and chisel... big fun!  We have uncovered just 1 bone so far and they were very excited.  We just sweep up well after playing.  No biggie.  It is well worth it as it's a nice kit and fun for all of the dinosaur fans.
0,My daughter loves this angry birds star wars Chewbacca. It's big and easy to carry around.  Very fluffy and plush.
0,Excellent product
0,Out of the park awesome! Bandai of America has successfully made a great, reasonably priced toy,
0,Love the bright cheerful colors! Good sturdy animal with no loose ends for baby to choke on. Quality seems very good, stitching is excellent. Perfect size too - not to big and not too small. Gave as a gift and they adored it!
0,Love this
0,excelent
0,great
0,Thanks
0,its fun and cute but the icing was not the best please make it better taste like horse crap
0,Came in a protective card case and sleeve. This was a bargain buy for me.
0,It was a gift...I believe "awesome" was the word!!!
0,Awesome toy!  My kiddo loves them so the little models are perfect stocking stuffers.
0,bought this for my sons 1st birthday and it was PERFECT!  The kids loved it and it stayed inflated without any issues with 10 kids in and out of it.  ages 1 year to 10. 3 1 year olds, a  3, 4, and 5 year old,  two 7 year olds and a few 8 and 9 year olds.
0,Again, just what she wanted for Christmas.  Until then, I had never heard of Sjimmer and Shine!
0,got it for my kids for this coming easter bunny season. i just hope they'll love it.
0,Great little toy. Lots of modes and options to keep it fresh for a while.
0,All my kids, ages 1  to 7, love these cars.  Nice size for little hands to maneuver around, and cool enough for the big kids to enjoy.  The shooter and launcher work well.  This was an addition to the loopy loop set, and both are well made and holding up strong after 6 months of vigorous play.
0,Water toys are my sons bath time fun and since he is a big, big, big fan of the movies Cars and Cars toy this made the perfect gift to his collection of hydro wheel toys.
0,This is a very good thing, I really like it, then I still need me will come again very good
0,I may fill these with helium and attach strings!
0,I like the leappad learning systems and thought this would be cool as they bring those to the Big screen.  This video game system is easy to setup and  get going.  I like that the games are educational as well.  This is a great first gaming system for younger kids.  It has an awesome transforming controller that is really cool.  Also has a Kinect style camera that makes certain parts of the game be controlled by movement.  The games are probable best for ages 4 to 6.  It does have some fun and educational games for those ages but then they get a little too easy for older ages.
0,4-6 month olds love this toy
0,Love it, thanks!
0,This excavator is a nice addition to my MegaBlok family.		-The colors are vibrant and it looks really rough and tough. The wheels are nicely oversized.	-Construction quality is very good. Wheels are beefy and solid and are made of tough plastic like the rest of the vehicle. The only weak point is the excavating arm which is a bit flimsy.	-Sounds are those of a typical construction vehicle and aren't overly annoying. There are 3 volume options as well as an off option which is nice for parents.	-The excavating arm doesn't attach securely to the vehicle. This means it will frequently be dragging on the ground behind the vehicle like a scorpion tail.	-A few color-coordinated blocks are included. There are 3 locations on the vehicle where blocks can be attached which is pretty cool.	-Decals come pre-stuck-on which is a plus. Batteries are pre-installed also. Take off the packaging and you are ready to go.		Overall, this is a simple, ride-on toy whose best feature is that it looks great.
0,Grandsons liked it.
0,Looks goo,d sturdy and promising. My only complaint is the missing screws. I had to go buy those from store after the handyman arrived. Had to pay for an extra hour due to this.		Giving four star for that reason. (The seller doesn't say the screws are included. But, would have been nice, if they atleast indicated the need to buy and size. {Like the toys that sayneeds twoAAA batteries not included}).
0,Great quality
0,Make sure you order the recommended RC Module Set for lots of hugs and thanks for your special little guy.
0,My two-year-old daughter loves the Little People figures, and has since before she was even eight months old. It doesn't look like her enjoyment in them is starting to wane. These are a staple in our home for every Christmas and birthday. Also make great gifts. I'm so glad my in-laws gave these to my daughter, as it has brought her hours of joy and fun.
0,16 days reached my hand.	Bobble Head. Box and Products were intact.	Very detail. I like it.
0,Cute
0,Great toys and a big hit on Christmas!
0,2.5 year old loves this toy.  This is probably one of his favoite toys ever.  Luckily, I purchased an extra set of characters that contained the crocodile.  I'm so glad because that is his abosolute favorite thing, although I didn't know before I bought it.  Every imaginary "game" he plays features the croc.  Most of the time various other characters chase the croc around the ship.  He loves to put the croc down the various holes in the different levels, with Jake following,  and then put the croc in jail.  He didn't want to have anything to do with Lord Fatham.  He immediately hid him away and hasn't touched him since.  He loves the "trap" door on deck and sliding the plank and dropping him to the lower level.  He uses one of the canon balls as a key and "unlocks" the screened trapdoor.  He has only seen the tv show a few times, but he is kind of obsessed with the ship regardless.  I very happy with this purchase because he's so happy.  I wasn't bothered by the assembly, maybe because from the reviews I was expecting much worse,  and haven't experience the "falling off" of parts except the masthead, which isn't all that important and easily goes back on.
0,It is an awesome motion toy, not necessarialoly used for timing - just enjoying.  The 2 colored "bubbles" make my old one-color version seem "boring"!!!
0,The 70's, now that was fun and interesting. Just to see what people wore will make you laugh.
0,Cute little outfits for my nieces twin dolls.
0,Great size.
0,LO likes this more than the other Thomas sets he has.  While it's a fairly simple run and pretty much one direction (insert Thomas, lift ramp, he rolls through, repeat - with some possible play on the loop at the base) he engages with it well. Bonus it doesn't require much parent involvement after assembly other than the occasional replacement of the dino skull.  Which can be nice after hours of assembling track runs only to have them destroyed in seconds due to some "climactic" activity or dino attack.  This did not get as fulsome as reaction initially as the other set we got (http://www.amazon.com/Thomas-Train-Take-n-Play-Adventure-Castle/dp/B00C3VMT58/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1425315829&sr=8-8&keywords=thomas+take+n+play+set) but it was the one he chose to bring home from the vacation home, and the one he plays with more often.  This one also seems to be much easier to loop into additional track than the other.	The other reviewers mentioned the small pieces of skeleton which come off the track. We haven't lost ours yet, but I wouldn't be surprised. They are fun for kiddo to play with though.  Given the price and the amount of play, I feel this toy was a great choice for my kid.
0,perfect for little hands and big imaginations
0,As always from Papo excellent detail.  An interesting pose and an articulated jaw is always a plus for me. Highly recommended.
0,Granddaughter loved it...  VERRRRRY happy....
0,Great!
0,We bought this for our granddaughter and she loves it! Keeps her busy and keeps her cool on those hot days when she gets soaked from playing in it :)
0,Super cute and the kids love it!  While the pieces are a bit slippery as the other reviewers mentioned, it's really nothing that a 3 year old can't handle.  Plus the "cheese" and 'lettuce" help to hold the "meat" in the buns.
0,My kids (3 1/2 & 5 1/2) and I had a lot of fun playing this game. My husband on the other hand is not a Disney buff, so he couldn't get any of the answers. Although we enjoyed showing and teaching him about the princess movies, I wouldn't recommend this to kids who don't watch Disney princess movies. It took a while to get the remote to work, but the instructions are great and as long as you're patient it will work eventually.		Great fun for the Disney family!
0,"Wow," I thought.  "SEVEN batteries for a toy gun?" Then I started playing with the thing and promptly forgot about the batteries. I fired it up and took it out in the backyard, and the next thing the neighbors knew, yellowish tracers were zipping through the night sky. After a couple of clips, I handed it over to my 6-year-old, who proceeded to make like a berserk Clone Trooper. The range isn't fantastic (especially considering the 4 batteries in the firing mechanism), but it's enough to get a nice effect. I could turn on the "charger" clip and within a couple of seconds fire off all 18 darts, each brightly streaking across my yard to splat against the back wall of my house. It's kind of expensive for a simple toy, but it certainly performs as advertised.		4 batteries power the dart-firing mechanism, while 3 more go in the clip to charge up the glowing darts. There's an on/ off switch on the clip, so you can use the gun in the daytime without running down the batteries. There are two triggers: hold down the lower one to spin up the launch motor, and pull the upper one to send the next dart on its way. The motor trigger doesn't require a lot of strength, so it's easy to hold it down and blast away. The firing trigger needs a little oomph and has a long throw, so the maximum fire rate is about 1 round per second. Reloading the clip is kind of a hassle (my kid needed a bit of guidance at first), but it's probably as easy as it could be. The generous 18-round capacity mitigates this a bit.		The gun uses a modular system that's compatible with other Nerf guns and accessories. The clip is interchangeable, and there are connectors for various attachments that can be purchased separately. Collectors should appreciate the flexibility. But none of that's required -- this toy is great fun all by itself.
0,I win AUNT OF THE YEAR!! Nephew could not contain himself, I couldn't each with the quality and the price. I'm looking for more!! Thanks.
0,I typically don't like glitter puzzles but decided to give this one a try as I LOVE the Josephine Wall images and have most of the collection.  I was pleasantly surprised that the glitter fit in nicely and didn't hinder my attempts at putting the puzzle together.  Beautiful image and colors.
0,This is a very good camera for kids.  It stores a lot of pictures and the quality is good enough for my 4 year old.  The only downfall is the projector.  It looks cool in the dark and if the camera is right up against the wall, but from any distance, it's not so good.  Overall, I am happy with the purchase.
0,This was another gift for my puzzle-loving mother. She lives in a small space. This has really helped her stay organized while she works a puzzle without having the project take over her entire table. I'm considering getting one for myself as well. I use ziploc bags to separate pieces right now. That's a quick, cheap solution but I only put together a puzzle like once a year. If you are the type to do several a year, this would be a good purchase for you.
0,Purchased this item a few weeks ago but just recently put it up and the kids have been on it non-stop!  They love it!  Would definitely recommend buying if you have small, athletic kids!
0,NICE TOY LOVELY  QUALITY
0,item not found anywhere else.  Great plane to add to boys collection
0,Sturdy, colorful, my kids love them!
0,ravensburger puzzles are great to do -nice cut, colorful, and challenging-but not too challenging! Enjoy them
0,Fits our wooden rail line perfectly.  At last we can make double loops!
0,Very fun, very durable (it's been dropped numerous times onto hardwood floors), and quite entertaining for all ages!!! My kids sometimes catch me using it without them!! :o)
0,Lightweight and cute. My 22 month old loves it - but it rarely has a doll in it, she just rolls it around and chases the dogs with it
0,My daughter is a big monster high fan... Problem was she has a twin brother who isn't a fan of dolls. They play together always so my daughter ordered this set so her brother might play with her. Yup, it worked! He plays with her now! Happy we got this! There are not many boy sets but this set was a decent price and the kids are very happy!
0,nice design and fit  well with others
0,Love Crowley and mark sheppard he does such an awesome job of playing the role and this one goes right along with my crossroads Crowley with red eyes
0,These are the absolute best toys available. I think I have bought every single toy from Green Toys because they are durable, last forever, and my kids love them! There are no metal parts to rust, and no cheap plastic to break. Absolutely perfect. This truck would be perfect for the one to three year old who loves cars. Perfect for little hands.
0,My 5 and 7 year olds like this.
0,Product arrived in a very timely fashion.  It is exactly as presented.	Excellent quality.  Works like a charm.  Completed my projects with my	grandsons in  half the time expected with absolutely no hassle.  Love it.	  I will definitely use this vendor again!
0,Got this for last Christmas when my daughter was 3 1/2, she liked opening it up each day.  The set was fun for her.
0,I children love light up things. We spend a lot of time outside in the dark by the fire and the light up items are always a plus for my kids. I seen this one and had to order it.		It is on a headband with teeth. The Mohawk portion then turns to resemble the Mohawk. The band itself I think is made a little small. It will go on the bigger kids heads, but it is tight. It fits best on my 2 year old but he hates the teeth. They bother him. There are several different light modes on this Mohawk. I personally like them to be moving and using all of the colors. My autistic son likes the steady lights as the moving and blinking ones seem to bother him. In order to change the setting you simply press the black button on the side of the device.		My children said after a while this started giving them a headache and they had to take it off. It is really cute and a neat design, just should be a little larger. It would be great for a Fourth of July Celebration, a birthday, or other special occasion. I would also like to see one made with pastel lights for girls instead of the traditional blue, green, and red combination.

0,bought these for the preschool kids. kids loved them!
0,Received toy on time. ..was the correct toy...everything was great. ...
0,Excellent pump! I love this thing!
0,Wonderful addition to my Zombicide collection. Perfect for the prison scenarios.
0,perfect for toddlers
0,My kids love this pool! and its perfect for the little ones, 3 and under. and it stays inflated! This was a great purchase, got it at target for 30.00. and it was worth every penny. If your looking for a great splash activity pool for kids around 3 and under this is the one to get :)
0,Works well
0,My son is 3, and really likes these. They can hold his interest for quite a while, and are FAIRLY sturdy to hold up to a toddler with supervision. I wouldn't let them do this on their own, however, as the cards are thin cardboard; similar to flash card weight, and they do bend/crease/peel.		This set includes a variety of cards that help kids learn how objects fit together, how to recognize shapes, and some spacial reasoning practice. It's pretty good. The only reason I've given it 4 stars is it's not the best set out of the series. It's OK, my kid liked it, I bought another to give as a gift, but the beginning science and alphabet sets are much better.
0,My granddaughter's boyfriend is loving this fun game!
0,thank you
0,Exactly what I was looking for.  These are really loud, garish and colorful lazer blasters.  I picked up four of these to send home with children when they left my house on Christmas Eve.  They were a revenge present for the loud machine gun toy they had purchased my boy the year prior.  Not sure I would want these for my own kids as the loud noises might drive you insane but they are perfect for other peoples childeren.
0,.this is a cute ganz.purple angelfish.it has	Purple ribbon on tail.and fins it has big yellow	eyes it is purple and yellow thanks for great price and delivery
0,I bought this as a gift for my 8 year old. He absolutely loves it. Its so detailed! I grew up playing legos and this is similar to older sets. There are no numbered bags, the instructions have more steps per page. I didn't mind though. I just dumped all 20 something bags out and got sorting. I freaking love legos! This goes well with the Lego Lord of the Rings sets. We figure it can be Dale or one of the other towns. :)
0,love this for dance competitions. I am well organized!
0,Great coop game.  Fun and challenging puzzle type teaches strategy with the path building required to collect the gold keys and outsmart the ogre.  I even enjoy playing this with my 5 yr old grandson.  Children over around 7 may find it easy (obvious) strategy, and the game would then be mostly chance based on the draw.
0,Love almost everything about this! Most of all, I love how everyone gets jealous when I'm easily folding this up after a tennis match and throwing in my car when they're struggling to get their big plastic one around the seat, bags, blankets, etc. Get this one over that one. The only thing that is a little annoying are the wobbly wheels. I wish they were rubber/ all-terrain but what can you do? I'd still get it.
0,Bought this along with the Hungry Monkey - my 2 year old and 5 year old love it at different levels.  Keeps their attention and is extremely well made. Carrots are big and solid, vinyl is sewn well constructed, it is packaged perfectly for easy storage.  Tweezers are great for all sizes of hands. This will definitely be one that I still have around for grandkids in 20+ years!
0,Very cute!  My husband and I think this is adorable.  Our 1 year old son has not been that interested in it though.  He does occasionally play with the vibrating drill or the hammer.  The design is clever though so maybe he will enjoy it when he is older.
0,Better than expected.
0,Love the cart. Nice and durable but could do without the flimsy boxes. I actually ended up throwing them all away because they kept breaking, tearing and getting smashed. I would recommend just sticking with the cart and plastic groceries.
0,OK
0,I got this for my 3yr old for our car trip.  he loved this and I didn't have to worry about any loose pieces all over the car, it is perfect!  My 7yr old even played with it for a bit lol
0,Good product. I have 4 and they're a must for the h501s. Last slightly longer than original and they have taken A LOT of 2c charge rates and still Charge to 8.39v every time.
0,We bought ours through Home Depot because it was Christmas and it just worked out a bit better. It's a massive hit with everyone who's seen it, from my 68 year old father to my toddler who likes to gently rotate her sister on it. Last week my husband and I stepped out into the backyard after the kids were asleep and he pushed me on the swing so high I could touch the leaves of the neighboring tree. The fireflies were everywhere and I fell in love with him again for what must be the millionth time.
0,Can you dig it?  Works great, bought it for a friend who has used it to dig up half of Indian Shores beach in Florida.  I got this for them because I broke their shovel trying to dig a small moat.  This is a serious tool and even though ours is being used for beach fun and sand castles it is a serious tool and withstands big boy sized castle wall construction.
0,My nephew showed me the magic tricks he learned from this set on facetime it looked like he was having so much fun. I recommend buying it for the kids.
0,This proved to be the best kit and fun my grandchildren had during their two week visit.  Both the two and four year old could play well with it and I only wish I had gotten more refills as we ended up with only two left with all the play we had.  One is still in the gutter and the rest are in the thick woods behind our fence.  No way to go back and its too thick to get through. I plan on ordering more and sending them for their birthdays this summer which are only three weeks apart.	The only problem I have with this and the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that the launch base is a piece of crap.  I have never seen anything so poorly made and completely not sturdy. My husband is going to build a base out of wood so this great item will work as it should.  We ended up with someone holding the base in place while the children played.
0,This little lamb far exceeded my expectations.	It is very soft, very sweet, super cute, snuggleable (if that is a word), and perfect size for a baby... and a great price.	Excellent addition to a baby shower gift basket
0,My son loved the legos and this is a perfect present !!! Good price !!!
0,These were awesome! My 2 year old loved them, but managed to lose all of them in 2 days!
0,excellent
0,My grandson enjoys playing with this new play dough. It is a little too soft for some things he wants to do, but we love the fact that it doesn't dry out as fast as regular play dough and smells better too.
0,These are just as fun as I remembered as a kid.
0,Grandaughter loves it. Takes it with her everywhere!!
0,My grand daughter loved her castle and is still playing with it. Great shape and will be passed down to next grand daughter.
0,We bought this set to keep in our trailer, as our granddaughters love tea parties. This is a good one. They love it, I'm glad I got it! Provides hours of playtime fun.
0,Cool toy, the kiddos love it.
0,went great with the trash truck
0,I bought this as an add-on item for $4.97 (a bargain in my opinion) and could not be happier with my purchase. There are 48 brightly colored large sticks included, and they are square rather than circular, so they don't roll down the driveway when the kiddos set them down. The quality is fantastic, very soft chalk, and the vast array of colors are absolutely brilliant. The downside to having such soft chalk is that over zealous kids can go through these pretty fast (our next door neighbor's child for example), especially if the drawing surface is particularly rough. My son has enjoyed these immensely and is much more inclined to color with these than those rock hard, pastel colored cheap brands you can buy for a couple bucks. Heck, I even find myself creating some driveway masterpieces! Crayola brand chalk is all we'll be buying from now on. Also, I added a couple of photos of all the colors and their brilliance in full sun and shade. I don't think any color is repeated, so it's quite the palette!
0,Nice travel game especially to encourage language, spelling and reading, for kids. My kids haven't yet explored this game fully but they seem fascinated by the well made pieces and have attempted to spell even complicated words (example, "peculiar"; complicated for a 4 year old) just because they can use the game cubes.
0,My one year old granddaughter love, love, loves this buggy. Wheels are a little noisy pushing her on the blacktop in our neighborhood (one can't hear cars for the noise) but I am sure they are working on that. I still give it 5 stars for the joy it has brought my grandbaby & the handle is perfect for grandma. Price is good also.
0,works great!
0,It was exactly as pictured. My panda lover couldn't be happier.
0,These Chuggington toys are so well designed. I used them on my son's actual birthday cake expecting them to be dinky, and they turned out to be study, very nicely painted and accented, and durable. I will be getting the rest of the set as well as some tracks to replace our Thomas toys. Chuggington is totally the new 'Thomas'. :) LOVE IT!		These cars are so cute and fit perfectly with the Frostini car. Great set. My children love Frostini, who doesn't love ice cream?? Enjoy it, these are terrific.
0,Super cute, real baby feel, definitely worth the price good quality.
0,Very well made, bright and cheery rainbow color. Allows my daughter daughter to scale a large front yard tree with first branch at 9 feet. Our monkey very happy with a ladder.
0,purchased several arctic sets for our daughter for her birthday.  She loved them!
0,My 4-year-old granddaughter thinks it is wonderful!
0,very nice and cheap party favor.
0,great toy with awesome details. Wing flaps are difficult to open (always feel like they are breaking) & the tower has already broken. Overall, great for imagination, sound effects & multiple uses (large ship, small shuttle, station, watch tower/front lines). Would be 5 star if a bit mor rugged.
0,This was a Christmas gift for my 15 month old son. He loves it! His feet couldn't quite touch while he was riding but that didn't stop him one bit. It came with the base already assembled so all I had to do was attach the plush horse to it by 4 nuts with washers. Very Easy!! It seems to be made of a decent quality. The base is just sanded pine without any varnish so it might be susceptible to liquids. It does not come with batteries and truth be told Im ok with it. Hes got so many other toys that make noise Ill just let this one go on without them for a while. He has room to grow with it. Overall pretty satisfied.
0,It was a gift for my son Who was born in the 90s. He loves it.
0,kids love it
0,Such a good invention, I need to buy another!
0,Really nice model. Relatively easy to construct... my 10 year old daughter assembled this entirely on her own. The instructions are easy to understand and follow. Pieces assemble securely and the entire model is very solid... enough for kids to play with without it constantly falling apart. Great learning toy at a decent price.
0,These are cool.
0,My 11 month old loves this toy. Its very cute, and for little ones who are obsessed with light switches this product is a winner!
0,okay
0,This is our second boat in three years. Sure they eventually wear out but the plastic is a nice thickness, very durable. 2 kids play in it and having the cover over it is a plus!!!
0,The helmet is a bit small but the chest plate and shield attach great to my son.
0,Perfect birthday decor!
0,very pretty. will give on grandaughter's birthday. Looked a little small for Barbies so we will see.
0,As advertised!
0,Awesome case. The tag pen is visible through the window in the case which is cute. We are using Tag Junior books right now and it will hold about 4-5 which is fine.
0,I purchased the Duck Pond water table for my 19mo after reading a number of reviews on various models. She loves ducks so I knew that feature alone would be a hit. I also wanted a "simple" one since you can always add additional water toys and we own plenty already. I like how the slide is a simple piece that isn't so tall my toddler can't reach and, if wanted, can be removed. My 6yo did take it off so he & his sister could play with the slide and other toys in their inflatable pool.		The spinner is a little troublesome for my toddler at the moment just because she can't reach it very well. She can grasp the handle - just not reach far enough to fully spin it - so she swings it back and forth instead. What I didn't think about was her older brother with it. He can, of course, spin it and prefers to at full speed so instead of a "lazy river" we end up with a full blown tidal pool!		The two included ducks are nice & large. Both have fun, bright detailing. I do wish they were solid instead of having a small hole in the bottom. This is one of the reasons I rated the table 4 stars instead of 5. If I had paid attention to their construction before putting the ducks in the water, I might have tried filling the hold with hot glue as I've seen suggested by other parents for similar water toys to help prevent water from getting inside the ducks. Two reasons for this - 1) to prevent any mold growth and 2) when the ducks do take on water, they tip and float sideways in the water. Not a huge issue, but still. Solid plastic would have been a better design.		The frog is cute and also has a hole as it's designed as a squirter. Place it on the little leaf flipper attachment to gently flip him into the pool. This had my toddler in a fit of laughter as she sent the frog flying over and over again. The simple cat tail scoop is a huge hit with her too. Amazing how entertaining it is to a toddler to scoop water and watch it drain over & over again.		This is a very nice water table. Nothing too fancy, but plenty to entertain with. Both of my kids have played with it quite a bit and I'm sure it will get plenty of use over the summer. I would recommend. There is another version of this table if your child is a big Dory & Nemo fan:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Step2-Finding-Dory-Swim-Swirl-Water-Table/dp/B0193MPOAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Step2 Finding Dory Swim & Swirl Water Table</a>.
0,My son absolutely love love loves this toy! It has the perfect power button, looks exactly like the power buttons on other electronic items so he is fascinated with turning it on and off which keeps him from turning on and off everything else! lol
0,A perfect addition to our backyard!
0,Great educational value for a child with needs! Very pleased.
0,Easy game to learn easy game to teach the kids all in all the production quality is wonderful we really enjoyed this game and it's great for youth groups and get together I would definitely recommend it to anybody that's looking for a good game
0,The Maxim Enterprise Over and Under Tunnel is a great addition to an existing wooden train track set.  The set consists of a wooden tunnel, two pieces that can serve as ascending or descending pieces and a small straight piece of track that fits on the top of the bridge to connect those two pieces together and to cover the gap in the top of the bridge.  The tunnel has a round connecting ball on one end and a rounded cut out area on the other side to connect train tracks.  Overall this is a pretty cool tunnel.  The small straight piece that fits in the top of the bridge has two tiny wooden pegs in it that helps it say put on the bridge.  This piece often blends in with all the other train track pieces so it can be difficult to locate, but not a deal breaker.  Sometimes the way that this little wooden piece fits together with the ascending and descending pieces is not be the best fit and can cause frustration in pedantic children but probably not all.
0,Everything was great
0,Another quality product from Melissa and Doug. Both of my girls, ages 21m and 3-1/2y love these puzzles. Plus, it is a great hand-eye coordination activity.
0,Great buy very nice and study
0,My 11 month old daughter doesn't seem to be interested in this toy. She loves to take things out of my bag, so I bought her own. But she prefers the real thing :-(
0,Used these for my daughter's mustache themed birthday party. Made great little favors. Still have plenty left to create things with.
0,Bought this for my 7 year old and he loves it. He's been using it non stop for the last 2 days and it's been able to take a punishment from him. Durable and fun gift. I would highly recommend.
0,My baby's first lego, he loves it!
0,Using this banner for my son's prehistoric dinosaur party.  Its is going to go great with the decorations.  Love it
0,Awesome figure!  So detailed and nice just what you'd expect from megahouse
0,Mulitple activities in one. It's very cute and kept the kids entertained for a while.
0,Love this little book. It was included in a baby gift package for my neice.
0,very cool cop car gargoyles cop comes with a look like for service at very cool must buy you will love it
0,Very nice first doll.  My 1-year old granddaughter is not interested in dolls yet.  She more or less tosses her around but that will change as she gets older.  This is a very nicely made first doll.  Nothing to pull off and possibly put in both and choke on.  Very cute looking and whould last long like all Gund products.
0,Perfect set for my son.  He loves the funko characters and these were a great addition.
0,This is the sweetest little wagon. I bought it for my two year old who fell in love with a friends full size version. This size is just right for him to reach and pull around by the handle. It's definitely too short for my 7 year old, but just right for a toddler, probably up until about an average sized kindergartener. It's lightweight so it doesn't hurt quite as much as getting smacked in the shins with a Tonka Truck. You know you were wondering.
0,Grandaughter who was 2 at time got for Christmas last year! She is CRAZY for Mermaids!  Likes to use in tub or out on porch with a container of water!  Has several of the small Ariel and other Barbie mermaids!  She left this little one at her dads and keeps asking for it so I am ordering her another! She never uses the clip on skirts but does like the little dolphin and sea horse!  The only negative is they're very easily lost! 4 stars just because they are about 4 dollars overpriced in my opinion but most of the mermaid toys are I have noticed!
0,Love this. Does everything I need it to and is the perfect size.  Runny foods will leak between compartments if tipped, but most containers will do that. No plastic smell. Just be careful about using a scrubby when washing the design - it will scratch it.

0,These dishes are going through several grandkids & they have held up very well. They aren't as tiny as soon so the little fingers can actually hold onto the cup handles. We love having tea together using this set.
0,My daughter loves it - this was her potty training reward (she's about to be 3).  She wished it walked further but was happy when we improvised a leash with some ribbon.  It is not soft and cuddly - you can clearly feel the moving parts inside - but this has not been a problem for her.
0,fun and cute, my Grandson at 11 months is a little scared of it at this age. I think he will learn to like it as he gets older
0,Well made, looks interesting.  Excited to have something "fun" to give as a gift!
0,2 yr old nephew couldn't stop playing with it. Liked how it was able to move on the carpet
0,My grandson is enjoying his hop ball! It was a big hit, and everything with the transaction was perfect!
0,Another great Hasbro product!
0,Grandson loves them
0,Great boxcar with independent suspension.
0,My little niece loved her doll for Christmas. This was one of her first Barbies and she plays with her all the time. SHe seems to be holding up material wise really well.
0,PVZ fan
0,jUST THE THING FOR PUZZLES MADE AT GRANDMA'S HOUSE.  WE DON'T ALWAYS FINISH AND WE CAN PUT IT AWAY UNTIL NEXT TIME WITH THIS TOOL.  NICE!
0,These caterpillar construction machines were exactly what I was looking for when making my son's 1st birthday cake. He loves trucks, so of course I went on the search of CAT machinery to add to his cake and birthday theme. Now that his birthday is over, he loves playing with the trucks. I do have to monitor him because they are small. These trucks are definitely durable.
0,My son loves paying with this set.
0,Easy for small kids! My 5 year old loves this!
0,The armoire is cute and was easy to put together.  Nice & sturdy.  It's a little on the small size (shorter than expected), so the AG hangers don't work with it.  The dresses are squished into the bottom, since they hang low even with the hangers that came with it.  If the height was a little taller, this would be perfect!!!
0,Cool
0,My 2 year old twins that love this train set!  There are a lot of pieces, initially we only put part of the set out and plan on deploying the rest over time. I see a lot of folks that have glued it down which will make sense later but again for simplicity an oval is working out just fine.		Pros:	Easy to assemble	Chose this over the trundle version because the drawer looked like a bear	All the pieces were there - and then some		Cons:	Shipping was slow	One edge is delaminating, but a touch of glue fixed it up	Trains are kinda rough.  We ordered some Orbrium trains that roll a touch smoother		Update 9/6/17	This train set gets at least 2 hours a day and we have not glued anything down yet.  The boys are starting to hook up their own track sections so that may not happen.  The laminate on the table map area is starting to peel, but these boys are beating the crap out of it. We had an initial break down when there was too much on the table so slowly cycle features on and off of it. Still sticking to my 4 stars.
0,We have to "tune" it frequently (I have no idea what I'm doing, so I guess I just tighten the strings), but my kid has had it for over a year and still gets a lot of pleasure out of it. It feels like a real guitar to her and for the price, I couldn't have expected more than what we received.
0,My 8 year old loves it.
0,Bought these to keep as last minute birthday gifts, when there is not enough time to run out and buy something. Now I just need to keep my kids away from it!
0,Cute castle!  My daughter was just as excited to play with it once we put it together, as she was when she saw it in the box.  Not much to it, more like a backdrop scenery for the two characters, but nicely made.
0,Kids really enjoyed this game and so did I. A little expensive but worth it.
0,awesome
0,Cute, durable, everything you expect from Fisher-Price.
0,Excellent service and product thanks!
0,great quality cards, my mom greatly appreciates them , and they are extremely hard to find locally so getting them here is great.
0,I am very pleased with this automoblox.  I was uncertain at first, but was reassured by the reviews I read.  I hope my review can reassure someone else.  The quality of these vehicles is top notch.  The kids love them, and they are increasing their brain power every time they take them apart and put them back together.  Mixing and matching the parts is fun as well as creatively stimulating.  I can't wait to add to our collection in the future!
0,I got this for my grandkids for Christmas 2017 and they loved it... built so many different things out of it!
0,Great addition to our Duplo box of toys.
0,This is an enjoyable game that  I bought my 8 year old for Christmas.  I do find that it is a little tougher than I expected, and my 8 year old struggles with it.  She is an experienced gamer and plays many board games that are recommended for older kids, but this one confuses her.  That said all the adults I have played with have enjoyed it and I expect that in another year or two or after another 5-10 plays she will be able to play it easily. Ravensburger games are always great quality and this is no exception. I would recommend this game to anyone 10 and up.
0,Great classic toy!
0,I was surprised at how small the cards are, but I guess with so many, it would be tough to play (stack and shuffle). The cards are about 1/3 the size of a playing card. The game is simple to understand and we are constantly surprised at how wrong we can be about the year something was made or invented. Each game is about 15 minutes or so since winning can be pretty easy at times. Our longest game was probably 30 minutes. But then you just start another game. Good filler game. We will probably buy some of the other related expansions and games.
0,I got only gold color confetti but it's okay because it's cute how it is.
0,This is a must have expansion for KoT. First, it gives you a 7th monster. Second, the power ups are unique to each monster giving them distinct powers, styles, and personalities. Third, it changes gameplay from the base game. Overall damage output is increase and ways to heal and mitigate damage is also increased. But you need to be wary since it can swing either way. Great fun.
0,This is just the cutest stuffed animal. My daughter got something on it the first day and it had to be cleaned. I popped it in a pillowcase to wash it and tumbled it on low for about 30 minutes - then hung it up to dry the rest of the way. still looks like new!
0,Star Trek fan.  Beautiful.  Love it!  Well made.  Love Diamond Select toys.  There is never anything perfect, but almost!
0,We purchased these to go with the Little People Princess Castle. They work great and my girls (ages 3&5) play with the princesses and castle often.
0,My husband and I enjoyed assembling this Bear Necessities puzzle tonight!  This is the second Bear Necessities puzzle we have put together.  The other was the pirate puzzle and we have the deli one to do next.  Overall, we really liked this puzzle.  The picture is so charming and all parts of the photo are in focus so you can see the many tiny details easily.  It's better than the pirate bear puzzle in that regard.  All the little details make it so you can pick up most of the pieces and figure out approximately where they go, which is nice!  So, the quality and appeal of the image on the puzzle are great.  The only issue we had was with the quality of the puzzle pieces.  The thickness is fine (though not as thick as some other brands like Ravensburger) and there were only a few pieces stuck together, but the pieces did not lock together super tight.  It wasn't so loose that we had trouble telling if two pieces fit together, but they were definitely wiggly and difficult to move around.  Oddly enough, the pirate bear puzzle was not like this so it will be interesting to see how the bear deli puzzle is.  I deducted 1 star for the loose fit, but would still recommend the puzzle if you like teddy bears and puzzles with lots of detail!
0,Grandson loved the colors and played with them for over 15 minutes.  Good choice.
0,Awesome choice for extra Husban X4 batteries.  Fit great, charge fast and last about as long as the stock batteries.  Great buy!
0,It arrived quickly. Super soft plush, exactly as pictured. I have a very happy child who wanted a lemur from the movie: lemurs if Madagascar.
0,Great game and quality. Great hand painted and hard cardboard. Has became on of the go to board games for my friends and I to play
0,Grandkids BOTH love this!!!
0,It wasn't as big as I thought but the kids lived it to cool thrm off on a hot day. Would buy again. Best bang for buck.
0,a really great puzzle. fun to do. best quality puzzle.
0,Nice R/C car... pretty durable and great for the kids.
0,Smooth finish on the wood beads and hole is large enough to string them easily.  Fun bright colors.  The lid has a flip up handle which we like and the container is sturdy and works as a permanent holder for the beads.
0,really cute.  good price.
0,I cannot wait to give this to my grandson for his birthday. I really like teaching toys. This one is really cool.
0,Relatively easy to assemble.  Has working horn, and engine sounds.  The remote control feature is particularly unique and impressive!  I purchased this for my 18 month old son, and he was scared.  But I think he will grow into it fondly.
0,Item arrived on time and as described.  Works well.
0,Nice product - good delivery
0,An excellent figure
0,Arrived in very good shape
0,good
0,We've had this almost a year & use it regularly.  My daughter loves it - totally worth the purchase.
0,My grand daughter loves these additions to our fairy garden!! They are bendy making it easy to hang or position well.
0,If you are a fan of the Manhattan Project then you will like this expansion. This expansion comes with new Hydrogen Bomb cards, V2 rocket missile programs, new countries, a new airstrike marker allowing only 1 or 3 airstrikes per round, unique characters you can draft (that grant unique abilities), new cube resource (lithium deuteride), a small board to place all your cubes, bombs, money, etc., and player aids.	The nations are the best part of the expansion to me. I never play the game without the nation cards. The H-Bomb cards are also always in the game as well.
0,THANK YOU!
0,Small toys, but a lot of fun. Our toddler enjoyed it, just make sure to supervise so no toys are swallowed.
0,Cute doll. Bought her for my niece and she loved her.
0,Good enough for a little extra color and light for decor by the RV. They're small in size and flimsy though. Still Ok for what they are. Just don't expect more. I would buy them again.
0,My son absolutely love this stuffed animal. It came exactly as described and on time. It is so soft and he sleeps with it every night,
0,My baby love it
0,Cute! I wish they'd decided to make these just a little bigger but for what they are they're neat little collectibles that don't take up much space. Well made and accurate.
0,our little boy loved this so much!
0,Can't wait for my son to see it on Christmas! I just know he'll love it
0,It was perfect for my little granddaughter.
0,Love this, but wish the lid snapped on instead of just laying on top. I live in Arizona and I worry about snakes and scorpions potentially making their way into my son's table and have to thoroughly inspect the sand before he uses it each time. I still have no idea what the big purple spinning thing is for as it really does nothing when water or sand is put in it lol I will also have to see how this product stands up to the summer heat here (plastic burning/fading/melting, sand getting too hot, etc) :)
0,easy to put it together	every piece works perfect	really funny for the kids
0,To me when i see these kind of prices for toys online, I look around for other deals like Target, walmart and so on, Sure I had to go to find this kind of toy in other stores and do a little toy shopping since there was only like 1 or maybe 2 on the shelves but come on really $40 no way, In target it is going for $19.99.	Now i cant find Bulkhead oh well, These are new Toys and been waiting 2 years for new toys to come out and when they do they are going so fast off the shelevs of the stores, So what i say is to get it while you can nbefore they are gone again and you see crazy prices again.
0,I like the tent and it was easy to install, although I did kind of think I wouldn't be putting it together since it was advertised as a "pop-up" tent.  The truth is, it is a pop-up tent, but then you have to put in three rods inside.  It still only took 10 minutes to put together.  I see some reviews complaining that it is flimsy, but all of these little tents are just for play, and eventually my kids will figure out how to destroy this too...only I didn't pay a fortune for it.  It is a good size and my son loves storing his toys in it.
0,Kids loved this!
0,Great tennis balls for our son to practice on. Low bounce rate means they don't fly very far when he hits them. This is our second bag of balls just because we wanted more to hit around during practice. Everything is great with them
0,What I like:	I like that there are 100 included in the pack. My son is always loosing his bullets. They work perfectly in his Nerf Elite gun. He carries the extras in a backpack that he calls his range bag. He likes to set up targets to shoot at and they work perfectly for that purpose. We have lost a few but have had none of them break or tear, so far. They are holding up very well.		What I dislike:	The tips are harder than the bullets that originally came with his Nerf gun. This is only an issue if you are using them for a Nerf gun battle. We have just deemed these as target bullets and they work great for that. Just be aware that the tips are harder and sting more than the normal Nerf bullets. Adults and older kids probably wouldn't care but it might leave marks or be too hard for little ones.		Final thoughts:	These are good replacement or extra bullets for a kid to practice his Nerf gun skills with. They have held up very well and there are plenty enough to last for some time.		A free sample was provided for review purposes. I did not guarantee a positive review. I did test this thoroughly and formed my own opinions on the product.
0,awesome
0,This drone is a decent size and has been a lot of fun for me and my kids. Even though the controls are too difficult/complex for my children (ages 4 and 1), they enjoy watching as I struggle to figure out how to fly this thing. Granted the controls are hard to figure out, in a large open space, there is a chance to get some air time and fly around a bit. Fun!
0,Happy with product!
0,nice
0,Warning: does NOT come awake at night and participate in shenanigans with other toys! Total rip off!		Other than that, it's great.
0,my child loved this! He is just barely six, could put it together with a little help from dad, but this lego set has stayed together longer than any other lego set, he likes it so much  He has already put the sub in the bathtub water. :)  It has stickers on it, but it didn't do much with one time submerssion play.  moving parts everywhere
0,awesome for kids
0,I bought this for my 10 year old, who is in the math club at school. He absolutely loves it, but so do my 6 and 9 year olds. It's a game everyone can play.
0,This will help complete my daughter's collection!
0,They fit really good on my daughter. Safety goggles should be warn due to the distance of darts and close range. I liked the clearness of these glasses, and you can really see the difference between the Nerf pair and actual sun glasses. I wish more kids wear eye-protection due to close range play.
0,My college age daughter is really into Sailor Moon figures and these came from Japan. She has a serious collection of items most of which came from Japan.
0,Like a Goldilocks but much more deadlier.
0,Amazing price on Amazon for these. Very happy with this purchase.
0,This Clifford is exactly what I was looking for. I purchase a small gift for siblings on Birthdays. Usually a book and something that goes along with the story. Well, this time around the first book I found about trucks had a plush truck, and the Sandra Boynton book I bought came with a plush piggy (actually bought Boynton set twice). So when I purchased the "Clifford Collection" book finding a small Clifford was pretty much a no brainer. I chose this particular Clifford because it looks exactly like a larger plush my son had when he was a little boy, right down to the 3 hairs sticking up on his head! My son loved that toy, the only plush he ever carried around everywhere! My grandson is a snuggle loving kiddo, so I can see him holding this close while mom or dad reads to him! Thanks again, Amazon for helping this grandma keep her babies happy!		This was a great purchase and a good price, for a good quality plush that looks like the plush from 30 years ago. I recommend this toy if you're buying for a toddler, it's just the right size to be carried around or placed in a little ones arms for a nap. If you're buying for a teenager or even an adult, this is the Clifford they remember.

0,My 8 year old niece got this as an early Christmas present. She loved it.  I might add my husband also spent a fair bit of time playing with it...		The device is little smaller than a hardcover book. The microphone is attached and has bout 3 feet of cord.  The child can choose different options, it has a few songs they can play and sing to, or they can just have it play the melody, or they can use it with music. It will also autotune their voice.  They can use it to modify their voice to sound really deep (my husband's favorite feature).  From an 8 year olds perspective, it sounds really cool and makes them sound a lot like current music.		However, the short distance of the cord means unless the child understands they need to hold the mic right up to their mouth and speak quietly, you are basically listening to both them yelling and the modified voice.		For what it is and for the price and for the ages of maybe 6 to 11, I give this 4 stars.  If you have an older child who wants something they can really create music with - look elsewhere.  The options are limited, the songs are very limited (there were only 3 song buttons) - it definitely isn't for someone serious about music.		Now, from a parent perspective, I'm going to give this one star.  We were only visiting and I was already sick of it after listening to it for a few minutes.  It gets pretty loud - probably a great feature from the kids perspective, but really annoying as an adult.  So, if you have a small living space where you can't send the child elsewhere to play with it, or you don't have a very high tolerance for that kind of stuff, pass on this, at least for your own child!
0,My 6 year old had a blast making these and they turned out really cute. I like that a lot of the accent pieces are reusable and can be moved from headband to headband. That's a great feature. Definitely recommend these!

0,I'm pleased with this purchase.
0,My son's preschool class had this game and he loved it so we got one for home. It is SO fun for the kids! Easy to play and store I highly recommend.  It does say ages 4 and up but my son and his friends all just turned 3 and they play it perfectly.  I have actually made this my go-to gift for fellow toddler parents because so few people know what it is but everyone loves it after they play. :)
0,These were SO much fun.  We learned a lot as a family by doing this project.  We ended up with 9 butterflies to release and we will do it again.  Make sure you have a couple weeks you will be home during the summer months to do this as they need a small amount of care and its difficult to determine the exact dates they will need moved and released.
0,Great product..
0,My daughter received the "Glow in the Dark Bendaroos - 300 Piece Set" for Christmas when she was 4 years old. She is now 6 years old, and she continues to go back to this toy over and over again. Now that she's used up some of the colors from that first set, I bought the "Bendaroos Glow In The Dark 500-Piece Mega Pack" to keep her supplied with a range of colors.		Only some of the colors are meant to glow in the dark, and of those, the lighter colors glow best. I don't put too much stake in the product's ability to glow in the dark - it's more like a bonus feature for me, and I really don't care if they glow or not. But, my daughter says she likes the way they glow in the dark because she likes to play with them in bed at night, and when I agreed to buy her new Bendaroos, she specifically asked for glow-in-the-dark ones.		My daughter can play with these for at least 20-30 minutes at a time, so they're good for keeping her occupied and quiet.		She sometimes tries to copy the suggested designs, but usually she uses her imagination and creates her own sculptures and art work. She does have trouble when she tries to follow the design instructions, but I don't hold that against the product because I really mostly value it for the way it encourages her to use her imagination.		My daughter's bedroom is wallpapered, and she likes to stick her designs onto her walls. They really do stick and will stay put! At the same time, when they do come down (by choice or by eventually falling down), they don't seem to leave any discoloration or residue on the walls, so I'm happy.		I would suggest using the Bendaroos in rooms with flooring, not carpeting, because their stickiness does pick up a lot of dirt and hair. Every now and then I will find a discarded, crumpled up Bendaroo on my daughter's bedroom floor, and it's pretty gross.		As long as unused pieces are returned to their plastic bags so they don't pick up dirt, they can be used over and over again, which I love. Their stickiness does not seem to wear off as long as you smoosh them around a bit. Whatever the stickiness is does come off on your hands, though, so you'll want to wash your hands after playing with them.

0,<div id="video-block-R1VQZWPYE4DKQA" class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block"></div><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C15Qj67dF6S.mp4" class="video-url"><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1RrIouxZcS.png" class="video-slate-img-url">This is adorable. Not only is there a cute little kangaroo that my kids get to hop around on there is another even cuter baby kangaroo in the pouch that comes out (there is velcro on the back so it doesn't come out while bouncing).  I love the look that the big kangaroo has on its face, like it is tired from kids jumping on it. :-)		Both of my kids love this. Technically it is for my son who is 3 and has no problem using this (he is a tall 3 at 41") but I think my daughter might have taken it which shows how durable this is because she is over 100 pounds and has been bouncing around on this both inside and outside since it came.		Make sure that you start to blow up the ball (the pump is include as well as extra plugs for the blow up hole) partially, then put the kangaroo on it and then finish blowing it up. If the ball is completely blown up before you put the kangaroo on it is much harder to do.		I personally think this is super cute but what is important is that my kids love it, and they do. My daughter's only complaint is that she wished the baby kangaroo had legs even if they were drawn on, he's pretty much just a head with a chest. I agree, that would have been the perfect finishing touch.		I received this complimentary product for my kid's honest and unbiased review and they love this ball hopper, it's a hit. :-)
0,My granddaughter love this palace pet!!!
0,The Kids and adults love it.
0,I ordered this for my 11 month old great granddaughter for her 1st birthday.  When it arrived, I decided to check it out before giving it to her.  Well,..............I loved it!!  My 6 year old great grandson was with me when I opened it and, needless to say, he loved it also.  So I gave it to my granddaughter early and we all played with it.  This is one of the first toys that the kids (of all ages) choose when they are at my house.  I kept it at my home because I sit with the kids during the week.	And, only $15.00!  WOW.
0,Unbeatable quality for the price. My 9 month old and 3 year old both use it. Sturdy wooden design stands up to both of them
0,love these dolls
0,My spout in my shower is wide and not standard and this little guy fits right on. My daughter loves him, she thinks he's so cute and mama love him bc no I don't have to worry about her bouncing her head off the water spout while taking a bath.
0,This Kaleidoscope is just as advertised.  It works well.  I'm pleased with this purchase.  I'm sure the child will be also when Christmas arrives.
0,The kids love playing this game. It is so easy and pretty fast to play.
0,Good price and good cards!
0,Bought two for granddaughters for Xmas they love flying them (still learning but getting there)
0,Was a gift for the child. Like it very much!
0,So much fun to play
0,I have 3D pens that heat up and use filament, so I was anxious to try these pens that are not connected to a plug and don't use filament. I do a lot of scrapbooking and I mainly wanted to use these pens for that.		There are 3 different colored pens in this kit; pink, purple and white (some of my favorite colors), and one LED light that the pens fit into (although not very easily and kept falling out until I pushed them in really hard). There's a booklet with some designs in it, a couple "domes" to make circular objects and a drawing sheet to put over designs when you're making them so the designs can be used again.		The video makes it look so easy; it's not. It's a learning curve, but I did end up making the bird in the case. I learned that I need to draw the lines or design before turning on the light. As soon as the light is turned on the ink dries and the ink that was coming out of the pen is now solid. So I have to break off the ink with a tissue and start another section. I have a hard time making straight lines, but after some practice I got better. It's also messy. The ink gets everywhere including my hands. I keep tissue handy; baby wipes work even better.		Do I like it? Yeah, it's fun to play with. By the way, there's no kids in the house, just 65 year old me. It actually does draw vertically once you get the hang of it. Since this is not filament, when the pens run out of ink that's it as far as I can tell and you'd need to buy a new kit.
0,It looks very nice in actual. I am so glad to have it.
0,Great quality toys, pretty colors and great size.

0,I wanted this particular kitchen for my daughter as her big Christmas present. I liked the vintage look, since it would be in our family room...I didn't want a big plastic dora kitchen in the midde of my family room. I also really liked that it was a fairly gender neutral girl, as I didn't want a pink kitchen that screams girl. For some reason, around Christmas time, there were some changes made to the kitchen, which meant that it was out of stock or backordered everywhere and I ended paying about $50-70 more for it from some independent seller I found on Amazon. I do think it is made in China, but I think it's still more durable than the plastic ones and pretty well made. In any case, it was super time consuming to put together. I (the mother) put it together because my husband doesn't believe in looking at instructions after whining after the first step, I relieved him of his duties. I honestly think it took me about 6 hours to put together. I am not particularly handy and wouldn't really be able to drill new holes where there are none, but I can follow directions. All in all, I would say it was not difficult to put together per se, as much as time consuming. All the parts were there, labeled and included in the instructions...you just have to go through many steps. In the end, it was worth it for me and our daughter. She loved it on Christmas morning and loves it to this day. I would say that there is not a day that goes by (9 months later) that she doesn't play with it. It has held up very well, with the exception of a piece of plastic that broke off one of the burners. I think it's a great size for toddlers. I love that it has many features in one, that a fridge, micro, and phone are included (not just a stove). My daughter loves the phone and often uses it to call Mickey and company. It is so cute that I realy don't mind it in my family room. Lastly, my daughter really loves our house, much more than the two other places we lived in her 2.5 years of life. My family lives nearby so she often goes to relatives houses with fun relatives and cousins and while she enjoys playing there, she often requests to go back to her house at a certain point. Obviously, I would hope that my husband and I have created a comfortable and homey feeling in her home, but I honestly think that she really loves her house because that's where she has her things, and top among that, is this kitchen. Even though I paid an annoying surcharge/overage for this particular kitchen (more than the pink one let's say) at the time I bought, I don't regret it at all and my daughter loves it.
0,Cute addition to an alligator ensemble for a sweet little one's first trip to the zoo. The pictures are precious!
0,These were very inexpensive, and my daughter loves them!  These seem to be one of the things that every kid that comes over goes to first...they love to put on little shows.  Great little set.
0,I'm surprised at just how stable this thing flies and the range it's capable of.  The X11 is a great little drone to learn on and can easily be used both indoors and outdoors. Despite the number of crashes mine has been involved in, it shows no sign of wear and I'm still on the first set of propellers.		Battery life isn't all too bad. I'd say it's around 5 minutes or more. I don't feel like I'm cut short with it no matter how hard it's being pushed. You'll certainly want to source some extra batteries if you plan on doing any extensive flying. The remote control it comes with isn't your typical square hobbyist controller. I don't see this as a con, because it's designed similar to the XBOX 360 controller and is very comfortable and plenty responsive.
0,These are some of the best sculpted figures I have run across in awhile that are sold in an accessible way. Smooth, excellent color incredible sculpting,great packaging. perfection. I can't wait to get the entire series.
0,Great gift for a 3 year old.
0,This plush animal of Disney's Goody is absolutely perfect and my niece loved it . Very well n made and at a great price . It is also the the perfect size for her to cuddle at night
0,Ordered for my five year old son for a school performance.  Fit his face perfectly.  A bit oversized but perfect for his role.  Arrived quickly and in good condition.
0,This game is great for my 4 year old grandchild, but it comes with 2 exact sets of cards in one box.  We just use one set now, and save the other set for later.  I thought there would be 36 different pairs, but there are only 18 pair.  Even so, it's a good matching game.
0,This cat is adorable, soft and cuddly. My friend loves Grumpy Cat and this is the perfect Christmas gift for her.
0,4 year old liked it.
0,I love this plush but the tail is made of just a flat piece of fabric. It was packaged badly compared to the other ones I bought though...
0,This was just as expected--a very durable toy that a variety of ages can have fun learning to count money with... and spend!
0,This is a neat concept. We used it for the first time to take my little guy to the beach. The only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is because it doesn't hold as much as we would like but other than that - the quality is good and we love it.
0,Alot of toys for candy bag stuffer
0,My 2.5 year old wants this puzzle.  It's a bit simplistic for her, so we take all the pieces out at once and mix them up, but she is amused by it and I like that I can throw it in the diaper bag for a quiet activity as needed.
0,I love this little buns. I bought him for my best friend's newborn and struggled letting him go! He's incredibly soft and cuddly and the 12in version is just the right size for hugging! I love his porportions and he sits very nicely all by himself without causing any trouble. Great detailing on the nose, eyes and mouth and nice floppy ears. He is the perfect companion for anyone who needs a good cuddle.		Secretly want to buy my own...I wonder how long I can resist the urge.
0,What can one say -- it's Spirograph!  Compact and still quite spellbinding.
0,I love the green ranger my favorite of all ranger mast have
0,Love that it is soft.  Very small though.  And if you don't turn it off on the bottom of the truck it will scare the life out of you when it moves on its own.
0,It's a pickle. It screams. As advertised.
0,great for looking like a sci-fi marine or just dork with awesome green glasses
0,I love the Hape dollhouse furniture! Very sturdy, my preschooler loves it! Fits fine in a Ryan's Room dollhouse.
0,Toys like this foster a child creative side. No bells, whistles and/or swipes.
0,Cool toy, recommend
0,Well, we do love this pizza and it is exceptionally well made, however I wish I would have paid attention to the previous reviewers' notes that the pizza doesn't stay on the little serving tray. The pizza is felt and the serving tray is a slick wood. It just slides right off. I'm considering trying some Velcro to hold it in place because I'm getting tired of constantly having to pick up all the pieces off the floor! But still happy with our purchase, it's the nicest pizza play set I've seen...
0,This is great!  I got this for 5 year old granddaughter along with a couple barbie dolls, vanity set, kitchen set, and bedroom set.  Everything fits in the box neatly.  And, the box sides fold out to make rooms.  After play time, just put it all back in the box - great!
0,this item was a gift and he loves it.  i think its almost time to buy more,lol
0,Grandson loves the fellow
0,The books are nice. I haven't read all of them yet. I bought 3 different bundles as the goodie bag gifts for my son's birthday, but they look like nice quality, he likes them, the colors are bright and the story lines are ok.
0,made my son happy
0,This set is fun and whimsical, as you'd expect from Cloud Cuckoo Land if you've seen the movie.  That said, the characters are the real reason we bought this set - you get Emmet, Wild Style and Uni kitty.  There's also a bad guy and a fun little snail.  The actual architecture pieces don't really have much long term value to us as anything besides scrap pieces... like I said, they are fun and whimsical, but nothing you really need to keep together.  It's more inspired by Cloud Cuckoo Land.  Unikitty doesn't stand up to play very well, but a little Kragl keeps her head on.
0,Great dolls and well made. They were a nice addition to our doll house. the children love playing with them.
0,These Harry Potter Funko Pops are adorable and perfect gift for my 12 year old daughter!
0,This adorable tea set is large enough for a tea party. It has been a go to you at grandmas house and lives on the counter of the kids kitchen. It is a home run when they keep going back to it and ask if they can borrow it	This has withstood the test of time, it has held up well. I highly recommend this	As an online shopper I rely heavily on reviews left by others when trying to decide what to buy so I try to leave useful reviews for those products that I feel strongly about. Please let me know if you find my review helpful. Thanks so much!
0,These baby critters are adorable my niece loves them.
0,good!
0,My daughter really enjoy this. I'm happy it's sturdier than their other play sets. The only thing they seem to have trouble is with the wings coming off but I think that's from there active play. Please make more play sets like this or like the old ones made of sturdier plastic. I refuse to buy another flimsy playset that hold together with cardboard  and plastic strips. They play with them in their wooden doll house because they are also tired of them coming apart.  Those were definitely not made for active play. More just to look at and have in the background. Bring back the big and medium sized play sets that fold close for easy storage.
0,Saving for Christmas but looks cute!  I am a fan of these carry case playlets and this one looks fun.
0,I was very happy with the quality of Model Magic in each pouch. All of it was fresh and ready to use. It was a great price for the number of packages I received.
0,I bought these blocks for my kids (2 and 4) when I saw them at Target after Christmas.  They reminded me of the Bristle blocks I had as a child.  I put them away for a "rainy day," and ended up pulling them out for a long road trip.  They were a perfect alternative to watching videos in the car because they stick together.  My children used them to build a variety of things: cars, trains, planes, people, pretend instruments, glasses, doctor equipment, phones, etc. You name it and they made it! My infant also likes the texture of these blocks. These were not only great for in the car, but they provided many options for play at our hotel.  The only complaint I really have about these blocks is that for whatever reason I can never get the lid on correctly.  My husband doesn't seem to have any trouble, but I seem to try to put it on and then it's not on secure and the blocks end up dumping out when I pick it up.  My husband says its just me!
0,This is probably my favorite game to play as an adult. Great with friends. When I was super young my favorite game was tag. When I was a teenager, it was how many different bathrooms I could leave poop on the top of the toilet lid. When I was in my 20's it was how many girls I could trick at the bar. *****30's & 40's spent in prison****** Now that I am in my 50's...Balderdash hits the spot!
0,Perfect for my 6 year old to play with
0,Granddaughter absolutely loves this education toy. It is a little hard to pull the pieces apart but pretty easy to snap the pieces back together in order.
0,I sat and played with this for several minutes one afternoon. I ended up going through two rolls of quarters by the time I lost interest. My dogs love to watch this so, it can be fun for them too.
0,This box looks authentic enough to fool anyone. We used this at Christmas for a family of five. We bought them a Wii game as their real gift and stuffed it in the box with a towel to make it feel like there was really a blanket in there. They were actually excited to get a "Blankeez" but it was still hysterical to see their confusion when they opened the box. You have to try this at least once if you know a family who could use a prank during the holidays.
0,Lego products always have good quality.
0,Fun and in perfect condition.
0,Nice model. Instruction sheet leaves a lot to be desired.
0,Very well done figurine, lots of details
0,muy buena
0,First Baptist Church of Sallisaw fills shoeboxes each year for Operation Christmas Child and we wanted to include some colorful, fun items for children who have never received a Christmas gift. I purchased these and I am so pleased with them!! They are really pretty and quite sturdy. I'm confident that the children who receive these will be thrilled. I'm so happy to be able to donate quality items for these children. Thank you for offering a wonderful product at a wonderful price.
0,Super cute for lego and Frozen lovers :)
0,These are the best thing that crayola has put out in a while.	My kids will sit and draw on our sliding glass door for hours.	It is a great way to even say Happy Birthday or welcome..	Yes we even used them for superbowl to take bets on who thought they were going to win,	Easy clean up and hours of fun.
0,My 2.5-year-old son LOVES these!  I like them, too....  haha.  They are hilariously fast and crazy and don't take much effort at all to get going!!  They go VERY fast with just a little push and we've had it for about six months and even with being as rough as can be with it, it is still in one piece and works like new!
0,This is a great product! We used it to make hand print molds for a gift. They came out PERFECT!! This is a very durable product as long as you use enough for the project at hand.
0,My 3 year old niece loved this.  It's a pretty good sized doll and horse.  The doll is just slightly smaller than a normal Barbie I think.  Cute doll.  I don't understand why the saddle is made the way it is though.  Maybe it's something to do with the movie?  I have boys, so we don't watch Barbie stuff in my house.  Anyway, good gift for little girls.
0,This gift will be given to a granddaughter on her birthday.  Service was great and I am sure she will be surprised.
0,How can you go wrong with Thomas the Train. The only issue I have is the picture that is posted with this product is misleading. The picture shows a red Tender, but it really is a blue Tender that can hold a little toy. So my only reason it does not get 5 stars is because of this.
0,I like this cute toy. However the vibration and giggles don't really last that long. I start it and put it on baby and before she can even realize what's going on, it stops. So I have to keep pushing the button. I like it, just wish it lasted longer.
0,Duplo cars, cars, and more cars - how could it get any better?!
0,I love the colorful melissa and doug floor puzzles!  They are fun to put together and usually educational too.
0,My daughter loves her crib!  She has put her doll accessories in the drawers, and at night we use it as storage for all her dolls by having them sit up. My 18 month old also plays with it, and even though he's rough, it is holding up very well.
0,Great Gift!~
0,Great purchase!
0,I have the 180MM version of this frame.  I can't believe the quality of it for the price.  I do wish the central hub were a bit longer though to carry Gopro/runcam/mobius more easily or even at all.		But if you don't want to carry an actioncam, this frame is reaaaallly nice.
0,Donated this to the police Christmas toy drive.  It looked challenging without being too hard and discouraging.  Hope it made Christmas a bit happier for some child.
0,Just as described.  Like the vivid crimson color.
0,Great stuffed animal for use in our preschool for Zoophonics.
0,This is a really cute, small version of a Play castle. I bought it for my 7 year old daughter and she loves it! The doll that comes with the set is colorful and her costume can come off  to change the look of the doll.
0,My kids lose Nerf bullets left and right, this is a good way to keep a giant pack when you have a birthday party at the playground and need some for all the guest kids.
0,Me and my toddler went nuts and had a blast! Lovely kid art keepsakes. Will be making ornaments for the tree next.
0,My daughter was using the huge colorful building blocks, but now since she is 4 years old the smaller ones are right up her alley.  I got this for a Christmas gift for her and am excited to give it to her for Christmas this year.  Very small box which will be easy to store, I am happy about that.
0,Thank you!
0,My son is 7 years old weghts 50 pounds and is 48" tall and the miedium size is great, has room for running and moving freely.
0,got for grandson
0,The model needed to finish my diorama. Looks and works great. Also price was right on. Very good,thank you.
0,I received this as a gift for Christmas and I am so glad I did! Love the surprise when the puzzle was finished. I've never seen another puzzle do anything like that before! The picture of the griffin is very well done. I enjoy finding something new each time you look closer at the details.		I would recommend getting this one-a challenge for even experienced puzzle builders!
0,A great product for young child, especially if they are afraid of the dark.
0,Purchased this for my granddaughter who is 2 years old.  She loves playing with it with her dolls.  Wish the powder and cream where made of plastic instead of wood.. It would be more "real like"..
0,We all know who Buzz Lightyear is, the iconic Pixar super hero that is a toy, well this buzz lets you have the same toy that Andy had in the "Toy Story" movies. This Buzz is very accurate to the figure in the movie. It stands 12" tall and has a lot of articulation, even the fingers move independently. The arms have ball joints to alow human like movement and the knees use ratchets so they can move but still hold buzz up. He has 2 voice modes. The red button on his chest makes him talk like a toy with phrases from the movie. The blue button then lets him talk in his clear, Tim Allen voice. In this mode his head will move and he will "talk" with you. His sound sensors pick up your voice and he will respond with his voice and head movement. He also picks up the tone of your voice and if you talk to loud he will panic or ask you to talk quietly. He has sensors in his helmet and wrist communicator so he knows what position they are in and will respond to them. He even has his flashing laser on his arm. The most impressive thing is his wings, he actually has film accurate wings that are the correct size and pop out the same way they do in the movie with the flashing lights. He even has motion sensors so he knows when he is "flying". A very cool toy from "Thinkway Toys" and an essential to any toy story fan or collector.
0,Barbie rocks
0,This is a simple fun, yet practical fun toy. I purchased it for my grand-daughter, and it was a hit in the tub everytime! So cute!
0,Great family game that utilizes a fun 'pick and pass' mechanic during gameplay.  Easy to learn and understand with colorful and whimsically illustrated cards.  Even very young children will enjoy this-
0,Great
0,Our son-in-law was very pleased to receive this as a birthday gift (toy).  Arrived on time and was just as advertised.
0,My daughter loves this!!
0,If you haven't got this yet, then the big box is quite the value.  In addition to the base game / core set, five of the available six expansions are included, making this even more fun.  It includes Expansion 1 - The Vizier's Favor, Expansion 2 - The City Gates, Expansion 3 - The Thief's Turn, Expansion 4 - The Treasure Chamber, and Expansion 5 - Power of the Sultan.  If you want it =all=, the only thing left to get would be the new Falconers expansion.  It's one of my favorite "go-to" games when we can't think of anything else.  One of my highest recommendations.
0,I purchased this toy for a one year old's birthday and I can't tell who enjoys it more, him or his sisters (3 and 5).  They love dancing with the music and using the repeat feature. Best of all, the adults don't find the sound annoying!
0,Great little fire station. Perfect for four year old into firefighters.
0,Great variety pack for 5th grade birthday present!  She loves it and it's loaded with shopkins!
0,Exactly what I wanted. Arrived safely.
0,This doll is attractive as described although the hair is almost too long to be managed. Also, the way it's packaged is awful. I've never seen so much elastic and metal and formed hard and sharp plastic to try to remove. Ridiculous and you can get cut.
0,Some shapes are a little difficult to work with, but overall a great product.  Hours of fun for kids who like to play with play doh!
0,a hard-working character who is cheerful and dedicated to digging as her place in life.
0,Cathedral is alot of fun...my husband and I enjoy games that require strategic thinking(9 men's morris is the best!)	This game is alot of fun and quite addictive! It's also pleasing to have a beautifully crafted, high quality wood game.  the only problem we had was that one of the pieces was received unglued but that was easily repaired!	I highly recommend this game for folks of all ages!!!!!
0,Granddaughter loves it!
0,This is a cute little craftiest that gives kids a chance make their own necklaces, bracelets , keychain  and charms. I bought this for my 4 year old granddaughter for birthday and she LOVE it. Very happy with the proudest.
0,My son plays magic, How do you review a card?	This card was very useful against most decks.  He was happy to find it on Amazon for a decent price.  He trades cards and the cards he buys here hold their value. This card allows you to get powered up by how many swamps you control.
0,Bought this for my 5 year old daughter and she had a blast. It definitely a project that you can start doing then walk away from and come back to. Making the block wet will help because it's pretty tough to dig. We also used a plastic knife to help and baby spoons. She loved finding the gems and still having to clean them off to see their beauty.
0,So cute and fit our 3 year old (he wears size 3t/4t) perfectly!
0,A talking monkey, perfect for the toddler and the fun grandparent.
0,This is another Figure from the walking dead line. Prison Yard rick is dressed in the attire Rick Grimes wore in season 3 of AMC's the walking dead.  Very Awesome.
0,This is my son's favorite saber. Very well made. Nice grip. Has held up to some pretty rough play.
0,Pencils are pencils, but mean more to a 5 year old boy when they have super heroes on them.
0,My 13 month old son pulls this snail around all day long. He hasn't quite figured out the shape sorter but he likes playing with the pieces.
0,I bought theses for my classroom my students love playing with magnets.
0,I did not realize how tiny the figure is, my grandson is always loosing pieces.  Not for small children....
0,Fit perfectly for my rustler transmission. Fixed one issue then I found another. No complaints about it.
0,good
0,Very nice product but kid should be intelligent or above 9 years. Nice projects. All components should have some picker to lift them from box else components like capacitors. connecting wire pins are giving way (snapping or damaging). PROVIDE A PICKER FOR LIFTING/HANDLING PARTS FROM BOX.
0,Great product! As described.
0,Wonderul sturdy doll.  Clothing well made.  She's fabulous.  So nice to see kid dolls.
0,Like others have mentioned, this isn't actually a tablet.  It is a learning toy that has buttons that make different noises.	The Smart Stages are designed to grow with your child.  The first stage (Explore) is for babies up to probably 12-18 months.  2nd stage (Encourage) for 12-24 months and 3rd (Pretend) for 24 months +.	Each level has different songs, phrases, and prompts.  There is a volume button as well.	My youngest (9 months) enjoys all stages of this toy, as she just likes to press buttons and hear them make noise.  My oldest (3 yrs) will play with this for a little while, but would much rather play with an actual tablet at this point.	I think this is a great price for this toy.  Comparing it to a toy remote control I had bought for the same price, this does much more and will grow with my child.  I would recommend it for babies as it will grow with them, but not for ages 2+
0,this requires no skill to use no special booklet you have to read to figure it out before you play with this.  child safe.
0,Awesome figure looks just like the character in the art work for the game. Very detailed. Light up gun is very bright and an excellent bonus.
0,Fun for granddaughters.  Good deal for the price a little flimsy and lots of putting together time!
0,This blade is great!  My sons love How To Train Your Dragon and this is a great compliment to their Hiccup costume!  The blade extends pretty far and works like most Starwars lightsabers.
0,These glow sticks don't just make bracelets, you can also make necklaces, or leave them straight and use them as wands, or do what we did and combine them with the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/100-8-Premium-Glow-Stick-Party-Pack/dp/B00N1R5SLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">100 8" Premium Glow Stick Party Pack</a>&nbsp;to expand the possibilities.  My daughter used them both at her sleepover and they were a huge hit.  That was 60 hours ago, and the glow sticks are still glowing.		I recommend combining the kits.  Add bracelets to the party pack to double the fun without doubling the price.		This product was provided for review by USA Toyz.
0,.....can never have too many of these.
0,It is more challenging than you'd think. You don't just match words to words, but words to pictures. And of course, pictures to pictures. So your brain has to keep switching tactics. My husband and I actually played this after the kids went to bed and found it fun!
0,Received quickly after I ordered - tutus are cute and perfect for party favors at my girls ballerina birthday party. A cute inexpensive way to make every girl at the party feel like a ballerina!
0,I want to begin by saying how much I LOVE that this set comes with its own bag!  Since purchasing this I have purchased similar bags to contain some of our other toys and now hang them on hooks in my kids rooms and toy area.  I would absolutely pay a little extra for a toy if the maker include smart durable storage solutions.  Brilliant!		My 2.5 year old daughter has yet to grasp the concept of playing the actual match game, but she really enjoys pairing up each animal.  The quality seems great and the imagines have not chipped and faded as I had originally feared.  My love for this product means I have added the PlanToys Number and Alphabet sets to our wishlist.
0,It's my understanding that White Mountain makes puzzle pieces in two different sizes and types and there is nothing on the box to tell you which you are getting. This particular puzzle has the large very odd-shaped pieces which are not interlocking and most pieces do not have an exact fit for adjoining another piece.  Therefore you mostly have to go by color rather than shape when assembling the puzzle.	This was very different from what my husband and I are used to. We had just completed four Buffalo Games puzzles which we enjoyed immensely and they're beautiful when finished but more challenging. It did seem a little easier to assemble this White Mountain puzzle but these odd sized pieces have their drawbacks. When you assemble two or more pieces outside the puzzle, you cannot pick them up and place them within the puzzle without their falling apart. You then have to join the pieces a second time. However, a day after we completed the puzzle we realized we had immensely enjoyed assembling it, mostly because of the different shapes of the pieces.
0,grandaughter  love toy
0,it's big, but my kids LOVE this toy
0,Love this pop.
0,Beyblade Temp Hammer Hit		This is one of Beyblade's stealth battlers.  The stealth part is the little hammers that pop out to knock the other guy's top over.  If you are old enough to remember Ben-Hur, think the pop out blades on the chariot wheels.		Beyblades are tops.  Probably the coolest tops I have ever seen.  My 5 year old grandson loves them.  They come with a ratcheted launch system that works very well.  They recommend only using them in their Beystadium but they work extremely well on hardwood and tile floors as just fun tops, no battle necessary.  However if you plan on using them in the Beystadium and battling another top, be prepared to be a winner with the stealth hammers on this little fellow.		Very cool, too bad I'm not 50 years younger, I would buy some for myself.	Good toy, lots of fun!
0,I'm a Homeschool mom and bought these for my 4 year old son to use. I like the 3 different sizes and colors. Very versatile.
0,I was looking for a hair accessory play set that would be functional for a 5 year old who loved to play with her American Girl dolls hair. It worked great, very cute product.
0,Very nice large bag.  Unfortunately I had to return because it was too big for the Mah Jongg carrying bag I bought.  Daily fits all your tiles with room to spare.
0,I got it as a gift for my 8 month old Collie puppy.  She LOVES it.  Sometimes chews on the eyes--I know, sounds gross--so if it can withstand that I am sure it'll hold together for anything your child does to it.  But she also loves to cuddle with it as it is so soft and snugly.
0,Really cool RC car, at $9 its an absolute bargain!
0,my girls both enjoyed this. I think it is a little pricey but it did occupy them for about 45 min's each. And we love how they can be stuck onto things like the back of our kindle, water bottles, pee-chee folders, etc.  We'll buy them again.
0,It's a neat carrying case, that's for sure. We haven't quite figured out how to get the ramps to stand up as pictured. The lid was a little disappointing- my son stepped back onto it and it immediately bent. Feels like it has pasteboard in it.
0,Even I enjoy this challenge! Great for kids maybe 8-12 year old. Good to keep them off the ipad and tv
0,Overpriced but worth it to keep stuffed animals in one place. Holds way more than I thought it would.
0,Transformers is not something I know a lot about.  I do have grandsons, so they are impressed with this figure.  I do want to say that the product details says the bottom age is 5, but the box say it is for ages 8+.  It does take quite a bit of maneuvering to change this into the dinosaur, so a younger child will probably need help and might get frustrated if they can't do it themselves.		I have also seen a lot of people wanting to know where items are manufactured.  This box says it is made in Vietnam.  The instructions also indicate there is an app for Apple and select Android devices.  I did not check into this.  The instructions also say that some parts are made to detach if excessive force is applied, and are designed to be reattached if separation occurs.  The instructions also show 18 steps to convert between the figures.  I find the joints move easily, but not too easily.
0,As expected
0,Bought this for my son and husband who enjoy solving rubix cubes.  This one drove my husband nuts for a few days. Challenging with different size cubes and all one color.  Cool concept and well received.  Very challenging, probably better for older kids/teens and adults.  Good quality!
0,amazing

0,Got this for my 3 year old, he saw it in walmart and asked for the phone. Hes getting it for christmas. Came on time. I haven't taken it out of the box yet, but its prettt big and pretty thick. I love how you can program mom, dad, grandma, and grandpa and a friend on this phone. You hit one the buttons and it repeats their number teaching them families numbers. All sorts of games and different ringtone s to choose from. My 3 year old will deff. Be a happy little man christmas morning. Thanks vtech!
0,Lots of fun for my daughter (9). Easy to put together. She's enjoyed playing with it and especially likes the puppies that were included.
0,The amount of floor space the assembled track requires is approx 2 ft by 4 1/2 ft.	At our house that's a manageable space to leave assembled for periods of time.	If needed stored a while = the track is sturdy to pull apart with no concern of damage.	The 11.81 ft is the distance around the track.		The set is very nice = the cars can go quite fast, and most of the time	stay on track on both straightaways and curves at full throttle.	Usually flying off when the second button  = turbo booster is pressed  = but not at a force that can do damage.		There's 6 guardrails included to install which help curves, but the whole idea of variable speeds is learning	control to stay on track, which is part of the challenge and fun.	Especially when both cars are on tracks trying to avoid each other at the center junction.		The Corvette & Ferrari (2" W by 4" L)  = are official G.M. & Ferrari licensed products.		The set is not recommended for under 8 yrs old. Being as the transformer needs plugged in an electric outlet.	And it takes a little strength to assemble / disassemble the track. (after first time = 5 min)	Plus the brushes need kept cleaned of dust/etc buildup for good working connection.		The 2 speed controller is 4 1/2" long to fit the hand of older children.	Which also nicely fits an adult hand, making this a great opportunity for parent / child quality time.	Yes = I think it's THAT fun.		The 15 pieces of track are 4 1/2" wide and seems quite durable.	The transformer is powerful = with 14.8 volt output.		U.S.A. = N.J phone # included.	Made in China.	-------------	The set I received contained 4 'H' and 2 small black pins = couldn't figure out there purpose. (cars work as are received)	Phoned the # inside box = who said there is supposed to be 4 extra brushes for the bottom of the cars.	and it sounded like the ones in the set we received are defective = will send out replacements (free)	If we need more in the future I can order extras = go to there site,	Part # 61510 - double contact brushes (10 per pack) For use only with GO!!! and digital 1/43 - $7.99	-------------	Sept 21, 15 - Received in 4 days, they're like on the cars. (the extra in box weren't complete)
0,I bought these a gift for one of my little nieces, she loved it.  I loved the way they looked that I bought the other dolls for her collection and hours of pretend play.  Looking forward to the new dolls of Ever After High!
0,I really can't wait to get all the other versions of Rick.
0,I bought this toy for my 8 month old for Christmas and he loves sitting in it. He is not crawling around yet, but I am sure he will enjoy having even more to discover once he can. My 20 month old also loves sitting in it and pretending he is driving. Would recommend this toy to anyone with a baby just learning to sit up and/or crawl.
0,perfect
0,Grandson was happy.
0,The cupcakes do not stay on the hand which frustrates my daughter.  Otherwise she loves changing Minnie's dresses and bows and at 18 months can almost do it completely by herself.  We store the parts in the original box, a storage case would be a great addition.
0,Great expansion pack!
0,My 1.5 years old loves this harmonica. She tries to play music in it like her grandpa. It plays a nice tune, the small size is perfect for little hands and it is easy to blow in it. Compared to a regular harmonica, less air pressure is required in order to make a sound. We love this product.
0,Mattel has introduced a LOT of new lines in recent times, but none was more anticipated than the Scaris: City of Frights line, because it promised a new movie special, and the introduction of THREE new characters, each one unique in some way. Catrine DeMew proved to be soft and beautiful; a Werecat with white fur, and beautiful blue eyes. Jinafire Long brought the spice of the Orient with her gorgeous golden hue, and unique body mold. The third new ghoul, Skelita Calaveras is equally exciting!  Skelita has the most unique and provocative body mold yet!  She is the daughter of "Los Eskelitos" (calacas, you know, those Skeleton decorations used during the Dia De Los Muertos celebrations), and as such she has a true "bare bones" body mold....in that she IS a skeleton; a beautiful, well dressed skeleton, at that.  Skelita has a beautiful face up done up in soft tones to represent a Day of The Dead Sugar Skull, and beautiful dark flowing locks with orange curls that frame her face perfectly.  Overall, she has TONS of eye appeal, and adds that WOW factor to any collection.		  Skelita comes dressed in what could be one of the best looking Monster High stock outfits, with an off the shoulder, black halter dress that could be worn by itself, and a multicolored, layered skirt that could also be paired with another top, and worn by itself. The beauty with her outfit comes with its overall simplicity: her shoes are a simple wedge heeled huaraches style in lime green, and her belt and wristlet are made to look like homemade leather goods. She comes with a character themed suitcase that opens and can hold a few pieces of clothing items or accessories, a brush, stand, and her journal.  Skelita is a great role model too, as the most important thing to her, and the source of her inspiration is: her family.		  Skelita would be a great addition to ANY collection, be it a doll collection, or a toy collection, and she is also a durable play doll. Mattel recommends Skelita for ghouls ages 6 and up, but I think with the articulated skeleton theme, the monster theme, the complexity of her detachable parts, and the complexity of removing her outfit, and redressing her, she is better suited for older children! I would recommend her for ages 9 and up, and BEST suited for per-teens! With her small removable parts, and accessories, households with tiny ghouls aged 3 and under, and pets need to be careful not to leave Skelita where curious hands, paws, and mouths can get to her!  With her highly articulated body, she lends herself to posing options that are only limited by one's imagination! Skelita is sure to provide years of fun, so invite her into your home with confidence!
0,The grandsons love these - even my almost two year old grandson can get the airplane together and he loves that.  It seems sturdy as well - seeing that the plane frequently "crashes" into the couch, the floor, etc.
0,My son loves firetrucks and robots, and he loves anything that has moving parts, so I thought this would be perfect for Christmas. Heatwave transforms easily, nothing overly complicated and easy to manage for a preschooler. As a truck, he rolls easily across the floor, and as a robot, he stands easily. My son also received the Optimus Prime Fire Station play set, so he's having a blast including the Heatwave robot in his play. It's a simple toy full of imaginative possibilities, and I'd recommend it to any car and robot-loving kid.
0,good quad
0,I got this for my baby when she was 9 months old.  We discovered she loves pressing buttons so we got this little toy for her.  She is now 19 months old and still loves this toy.  When she is being fussy while we're out, we give this toy to her and she calms down.  We do the same when we're home and she becomes fussy while eating.  It turns her focus on the toy and we continue feeding her.  It is baby and mommy's favorite toy.
0,These are cute. They are the size of my finger. Only problem the eyes are stickers and some come off but you really don't need them. Perfect for a 1year old
0,My LO loves this on his car seat!
0,Fisher-Price Little People is a Great Product for a Toy it is refreshing that you can still purchase a product that is durable and built to last. Fisher Price Little People makes their toys with the same detail and quality they made when I was a Kid. My 3 year old Love's It.

0,I loved it. My family loves to play games and sometimes the competition takes over leaving hurt feelings,  but not with this game- it is cooperative. Everyone was useful, once we understood what the different roles do. We still have not won- but we are getting closer.
0,This was a Christmas present for my 6-year-old, and she's having a wonderful time with it. She continues building it into different configurations. There are (obviously) a lot of small parts, so I have to be diligent about making her put everything back into the box after she's done so we don't lose our marbles or step on anything.
0,These are big and fun and perfect for a goodie bag at Halloween. For plastic insects, they are great!
0,some of the best gripping tires ive had on the losi min 8 t  rips on pavement and grass.
0,My 7 year old loves this cash register.  The play factor is great with the mic, credit card and working scanner.  As a parent, there's a few things I wish were done a bit better.		As for its function, it only performs basic add/subtract functions rather than real cash register functions like creating a total, inputting how much the person paid, then showing change due.		The mic volume isn't adjustable, and while that's sometimes good, it's actually a bit too low.  You have to have your mouth right next to it in order for it to pick up your voice, and then your own voice is almost louder than the mic.		The scanner works, but only if it's lined up correctly.  If you try to scan real barcode, it usually defaults to saying $4.99.  It works by having 3 LEDs that look for a thin or thick black line, which then controls how much light goes into the corresponding three sensors.		The drawer works, but sometimes takes a really firm press of the button to work right.  The drawer dividers are bigger than real money, so there's three spots for bills and four for change - plenty enough for any lemonade stand.		As compared to other registers, we've had better and worse.  The learning resources was probably the most durable, while other ones that had a nicer mic didn't have the real scanner.  So this one sits kind of in the middle, but it's fine for what it is and our son likes it.
0,awsome
0,If you've played DC DBG and Legendary: Marvel, this game may piss you off.		Seriously, you are going to be mad that neither of those are built more like this instead of "draft" style games.  Each Hero is actually their own unique deck of 40 cards, with a Hero card with different life values and special powers starting the game in play.  You also don't use and redraw your entire hand every turn.  In this regard it is more similar to playing a specialized deck of Magic the Gathering (MTG) cards playing against the Villain.		Now getting to the Villain, each of them has their own unique deck of cards that includes them attacking, their minions, or their special powers and abilities.  They have wildly different difficulties from wanting to pull your hair out tough to babies might accidently play the correct cards to beat them.  Later expansions also include more options to have "villain groups" to where there is one villain per player (highly recommend picking these up).		Finally there is an Environment deck.  These cards often effect both the villains and the players, and can be tactically used to help defeat the Villains and their minions.  Some environments massively help particular villains as well in ways you wouldn't expect until you play with those combinations.  Street thugs, to military defenses, to lava flows can pop up out of these decks and really ruin your day or secure the win.		So, why would this game piss you off?  Because this is the game many would have preferred when playing characters they know with specific powers and skills.  Instead of having a deck where you were playing Superman with swords and villains helping him out, or Iron Man cards being a part of each individual player's deck because you were all drafting his cards, they COULD have done something like this where you were playing a individual specialized deck for those heroes.  Those games often fail the players really feeling like those characters are the ones they are playing or utilizing and it often ends up being a random mash up of cards at the end.  That doesn't take away from the fact that both of those games are fun in and of themselves, but this game more captures the feel of you playing the selected hero against the selected Villain, in the selected environment.		The Villain decks are the biggest thing that's a shame the others couldn't have adopted a system closer to this.  Rarely do you really get the feel you are up against Magneto of Mr. Freeze or whoever in their respective games.  It's a card with art on it with other cards with art flying around on the table (again, I think both of these games are fun, just not as immersive as they could be).  Here, the Villain is throwing THEIR minions at you, using THEIR powers against you, and have their OWN personally plots and schemes they are trying to accomplish.  Imagine playing Dr. Doom with not only his Doombot army, but also using his magic against you, and if fighting in Latvia, the environment would actually compliment his deck.		I don't lack imagination and can appreciate everything the other games bring to the table, in particular since they are a completely different style.  But this one hits on so many points that the big comic company games slightly miss the mark on that it can frustrate you that you aren't playing AS Spider-man, Wolverine, Iron Man, and Captain America against the Baron Zemo while in the Rockies.  Oh what could have been............
0,There are so many monster truck die-cast available and this case works very nice as a central place to keep 15 of them.  Works fine and I have no issues with it.  Holds the 1:64 scale trucks (small).  Nice and rugged with good Grave Digger art on the front.  If there was 30 truck version I'd buy it.
0,This is a really fun game. It is great to use for your family, or even better, for parties. You can come up with your own rules if you want. You have to use the clues to try to guess the things. You can play in teams or just all play together. We used it for family game night. They range in how easy or difficult they are, but they are all fun. I'd recommend it.
0,Got it for my daughter, she loves it... came fast, in really nice condition, even better than i expected. Worth the money
0,xmas gift for my daughter she loved it cute purse
0,would purchase again.
0,These are great quality and quite large. Used them on my Oogie Boogie costume and they turned out great, though I needed another bucket of bugs to be the smaller filler bugs.
0,The blades are well-balanced and came as advertised performance wise I have noticed that they do help with quicker reaction time because they are a little bit more rigid than the original plastic blades.
0,The true test for this toy is my 3 1/2 year old grandson.  He was immediately attracted to this toy.  It is simple in design and color and can withstand the rigors of a child dropping,  crashing and having fun.  It is not a complicated toy and perfect for stimulating his imagination. He likes putting the men in and out of the rocket ship, taking off and flying around the room.  During his bath he asked for it and we found out it makes a good bath tub toy as well.  I like the simplicity of the toy and its being so durable.  I highly recommend this toy.
0,My 3.5 yr old loves this. He uses it in church for a quiet activity.
0,We first bought the Bubble Generator from Target, which only worked about a minute before breaking. So we were hesitant to try another machine, especially one in the same price range. But this machine is GREAT!! It works VERY well, it's a good value for the price, and it entertains my kids for a VERY long time. We are even planning on using it for my daughter's 5th birthday party. I would recomment this product to friends with confidence.
0,Our guests loved these bags. They were perfect little party favor bags for my son's construction party.
0,Used 2 of these as a guest book at my daughters party so when she uses the game they all have cute things written on each block.
0,These are a great compliment to play-dough. We keep a set of these in our diaperbag and take them with us to keep our 3yr old entertained. I bought some of these kits along with play-dough and made small gift baskets for his friends for Christmas.
0,Good size
0,A really cool set.  Very easy assembly for my 7 year old.
0,Wonderful game.  Super well balanced and easy to learn.  I have just as much fun playing with the kids as i do with my friends.  The ONLY bad part of this game is that it is addicting and expansion pieces are expensive.  So if you do go into this game, expect to shell out quite a bit to build yourself a collection to play with.  But personally I feel its worth it!!!
0,Very happy with this purchase.
0,100% satisfied.
0,The Twirl & Spin Ride playset is a pretty cool looking set. It's easy to assemble and just as easy to take apart after being played with. It's not too much of a problem to put the dolls on the seats, although the "adult" dolls (Barbie, Teresa, Raquelle, etc.) don't stay as well as Barbie's sisters do.		I think younger kids will get a kick out of this set. Those that are a bit older might get bored faster than the younger kids might. Although it's a fun idea, just spinning the ride around does get a little boring after all. But if your child has a big imagination (and some of the other carnival accessories that are sold separately probably doesn't hurt) than this is a great toy. The Stacie doll that comes with the set is very cute and a plus to buying this playset.
0,this set is so adorable
0,Let's just be clear.  We have numerous Barbies at home who have already had their hair "cut and styled".  So this was really not a bad idea for Barbie.  Pretend scissors and various hair extensions to let your little girl do exactly what you know she wants to do with Barbie anyway.  My eight year old enjoyed it!		Other than the scissors and extensions, this is a regular Barbie.  So when the kid has grown tired of cutting and styling, she fits right in with the other Barbie games.  I personally find that a real "plus" as opposed to some of the more gimmicky Barbies.		Not a bad price either.  $13 would make this a great gift for a niece or a friend's party.
0,great item and delivered as promised
0,Alright for traveling.
0,My 4 year old loves them!
0,compare to Rummikub, it;s the same game, identical, yet better.... 3 tier racks (better for play), sturdy racks, with legs that fit snug.	Also, better are that this set has 4 dictinct colors, unlike original Rummikub, which has a red and an orange which make it difficult for some people to decipher. This is THE SET to purchase.  Great for all ages, 8+
0,Great game, super fun. Great as an expansion to Kingdom Builder.
0,Exactly what I expected...my boys will love it.  The price did make me grumble just a little for what you get.  But I knew going in that Minecraft toys can be pricey
0,this is the cutest ever. There is not one person who doesn't smile when they see him on this- even teenagers! love the quality and the sounds it makes- very entertaining for him. Also like the handle - this weekend i had my 5 year old niece over and she pushed my son all over!!! 2 kids entertained at the same time- cant beat that. I took one star because there is no storage whatsoever to place a cup or snack or extra diapers....that would be perfect. Also, there is no option for the steering wheel to actually move the front wheel, which will be a problem when my son is old enough to push the car with his feet.
0,This is a great price for these!  Great stocking stuffer!
0,It's pretty much the same game of Life I remember playing as a child. The electronic banking is a nice enhancement, unless you have a cheater in your group of players. Then you might want to have someone designated as the banker to take care of the banking for everyone. Recommended.
0,Never met an automoblox car that this house didn't like. These are the most played with toys in our house. They are sturdy and withstand near constant abuse. The more you have the better so that the pieces can be interchanged for creative new cars. I plan on keeping these for grandkids when my now 5 and 2 year old are done with them.
0,I originally thought these were way too much like the toys we buy for our dog at about $2.99 each but my son LOVES them.  He is 9 months old and can hold them easily and loves to throw them with one hand.  Although it means a lot of picking them up, the amount of joy it brings him makes it totally worth it.  These are the first toys he goes to.
0,One of the best games I have ever played, fast and fun.  We play during the time I cook and in the night before bedtime.  Fast and fun for all ages.
0,Always love Puzzles
0,My great niece loves it
0,my son went nuts for this!
0,Very cute pop. Nice quality box and he just looks so cute and tough!
0,This is a fun game to play with my kids.  They enjoy solving the mystery, and while the optimal move is obvious for adults, try to restrain yourself and let the kids figure it out.
0,grandson enjoyed it
0,great for teaching kids to make a sandwich
0,Very cute.  My granddaughter loves it.
0,I bought this for my son for his birthday and at first he loved it but as soon as he achieved everything in the app he didn't play with it anymore. Its a brilliant toy but lets be honest there really isn't much you can do with it. Its tiny and cute and at first you're amazed but watching it stack cubes get old quick.
0,I received 24 eggs in their original blister packs, packaged 8 to a box (3 boxes).  Great throwback giveaway for an upcoming class I'm teaching!  Fun for kids and adults alike. I attached a photo of one of the eggs I received.  All were in this condition (no visible shelf-wear, brightly colored, individually wrapped).
0,These lanyards are much better quality than I expected, taking my 3 grandchildren to Disneyland and, as suggested by another review, am putting 40 quarters and 20 shiny pennies in the pouch for them to buy pressed pennies as souvenirs!  I was thinking of turning the actual lanyard around so that any trader pins that they buy will show up better on the solid side rather than on the Disney character side.  Also, I am putting our contact information in the clear vinyl side of the pouch just in case it is lost.
0,I am a huge one piece fan... every one knows P.O.P makes the greatest figures, but they are not cheap... so if you are looking for something cheaper with great details then you can't go wrong with Figuarts Zero... I finally got the whole crew and they look great on display :D
0,Great grandson loves this!!
0,I got this for my nephew and for the price it is such a great option. My nephew is 6 and really enjoys toys like this.
0,Fun toy:)
0,took a while to get the hang of it but now second nature,nice charger
0,good thanks
0,Great game
0,Purchased for 5 year old Granddaughter. She was thrilled with the guns and holster and the roll of caps! She enjoys playing with other friends!
0,My kids love these! Thank you!
0,I know it says styles may vary but i was kinds hoping to get mix of cars ( ambulance , police , trucks etc ) , i only received small cars with different colors , which is ok as well but was hoping more for a mix of different kinds of cars , not just different colors , other than that its nice
0,Great fit, even for small 3 year old arms! Softer plastic than the discount store ones and just what I remember from when I was a kid
0,my son loves the mystery packs. he was hoping for Mr. gold (haha) but got the grandpa instead. which is adorable. he comes with a coffee mug and newspaper.
0,Great for one-year-olds! I love that the cars are soft, so if your baby falls face first on them, it's okay! Because they are wind up, you can use them  to wear out crawling babies. Just wind them up and the baby will follow them back and forth across the room, giggling the whole time. So much fun for new crawlers.
0,These party cups are the perfect addition to a knight birthday party.  They were sturdy and colorful with fast delivery.
0,Renewable fun in a box
0,Very good quality. My child loves it.
0,Well made outfit that fits the 18 inch American Girl Dolls very well.  No complaints, good quality.  My daughter will soon be getting her black belt and she loved this.
0,As described
0,Okay, my son wanted a Mount Rushmore birthday cake. Although my husband is a great chef and will attempt anything in a cake, I purchased this kit to make the process easier.		We melted the white chocolate, added some food color and magic...Add it to a cake and you have a mount rushmore cake.		Once the day was over, my son enjoyed making the cement version!		Nice detail...easy to use
0,Definitely a treat for children 8 years and older.	The quality of this Blaster is very good.	We have a lot of fun with this Blaster, most adults who visit Love him too.	Children are delighted to hear its nasty sounds (burping and farting sounds are included).	You can watch my video about these little Rabbids and this blaster.	That way you can see how much fun it is.	youtu.be/NLcZp6mTuUA
0,High quality figures.  My son loves paying with them
0,The microphone has no volume control.
0,My 3 year old grandson lived these!!!
0,These little bottles of bubbles were a huge hit at my sons birthday party! Perfect for a little dinosaur lover.
0,Received as expected in a timely fashion.
0,Complicated game but wonderful strategy inducing challenge! My whole family is playing it and loving it. Inspires healthy competition among friends too
0,these  crayons are a great option for our daughter. She loves them! Along w most objects they do still end up in her mouth but they have had a long shelf life so far. She gets very excited when she can express herself w these crayons and even tho she chews them she colors more than she eats them
0,Perfect!!
0,My daughter (and I) love this line of Nerf products. It has been so fun to play with the "boys" with our new bows!
0,My 4 year old loved this for about a month and now visits it randomly. She still enjoys the noises and feeding her. It is a big and sturdy toy for the price but for the price I wish she spoke or walked or something.	My daughter isn't at all disappointed but she does not play with her more than a few minutes a week after the new has worn off.
0,My seven year old loves it and it was also a great birthday gift for a friend of hers.
0,Loads of fun - it REALLY takes off.  Be careful with it though because ours got caught in a tree too high up to retrieve.
0,As former SP, this is by far the best challenge coin I have seen and we will be buying more soon.  We have started exchanging them with other service members and other professionals as well.
0,Our 5 year old Granddaughter was delighted.  I gave it 5 stars even though I did make pillows and blankets for it and used the bedding that came with it as the mattress.  However, I expected that would be the case, so it was just as I expected.  It was easy to put together and the final product is sturdy and loved.
0,We first got baby Tiana when my daughter was about 20 months. She instantly fell in love and it's been a steady favorite doll. It has the perfect proportions, size, and weight. The face is absolutely beautiful and the head and extremities are made of a soft plastic. At first I didn't like the material of the clothing. It looked a little cheap, but I grew to really love it as there is no pilling or seams coming undone after 6 months of regular toddler play. They're also flexible enough to stuff into a diaper bag or backpack. My hands-down two favorite features: there is no hair and the clothes do not come off! I don't know why but I am really bothered by having naked dolls with matted hair everywhere and being unable to find their clothes. They look so messy and unkept after so little time. I stopped buying dolls with hair. For the next several years, until my daughter is able to really care for dolls hair and not be so interested in removing the clothes and losing them in the dark recesses of her toy box, I'll buy dolls like this.		I live abroad and came across these dolls in a toy store here, but didn't get them when I had the chance, and haven't seen one in a long while. I ordered the Mulan doll now and don't even think I would bat an eye at purchasing a couple more. Another thing I like is that this particular doll line is so diverse, there is a good chance you could find one to look like your child. Mulan looks just like my daughter when she was a baby. She picked out Tiana at the store who also is such a beautiful doll. She carries them around and plays with them together. Even after she's put them down after a while, she'l instantly become engaged with them if she sees someone else pick them up.		If I had to find something wrong with it, it's would definitely be that it has loose glitter on the skirt. I really dislike anything with glitter as it always seems to get on everything and never come off. I also have an infant at home and I'm always worried about getting glitter in his eyes by being around his sister's toys. They could make it shimmery by using a different fabric. In my opinion it's completely unnecessary.		I feel like I need to get more as I've heard they've discontinued this model and should anything happen to her "babies", I don't think I can find another one to be such a perfect fit.
0,Bought this for my 1 year old he loves it! Dances, sings! Its a great toy!
0,Excellent
0,Beautiful!
0,My first quadcopter ever. Took me about a week to fly well. Went through ten sets of blades. This quadcopter is worth every penny! Extremely durable. Extremely fast in expert mode. Perfect for beginners. Just be sure to buy extra blades and batteries. Crash pack also. I have already replaced  the body on mine after countless crashes. Motors are still strong even after 13 batteries going through it, every time I take it out. Be sure to let the motors cool in between battery swap.	Oh and look up the LED modification, it helps out greatly for night flights.
0,We have quite a few of the older track builder sets and they are all pretty good.  This is the 'stunt kit' for the new system (which is basically the same tracks but new items within it).  It's kind of slick in that there are 4-5 different layouts you can setup.  Unfortunately on their own there isn't a whole lot you can do with it after you've built the 4-5 things.  There is some play here (see how high you can jump the car, see how far you can jump it, etc), but it's limited.  There are a lot of fun pieces in this set though, and they work great with our existing track builder items.		The box itself is designed to work with the track as well, and be a storage set.  Which is a good intention unfortunately its still a thin cardboard box so it gets wrecked easily.  I like the intention though.
0,I purchased these in advance for my son's school classroom parties.  If I worrier at all about the quality I was wasting my time, because these are great!  Thick solid rubber, better than some I've bought for a dollar each.
0,I use this with the Chessex Dice boot and they work great together.  Since I have purchased this and the Dice boot I have not had to worry about pieces on the game board form being knock every where.
0,I am always looking for fun, creative gifts for our nieces and nephews.  Art sets such as these typically have lower quality items in them than if you purchased separately.  These seem to be on par with other similar sets - a good quality, but not as nice as if you purchased name brand separately.  That being said, this set is adorable and perfect for our nieces and nephews (all 12 years old or younger).  Older kids/teens may want a more advanced set.		Pros:	-Perfect for elementary kids and younger!	-Includes a variety of art materials	-Perfect for gifts, road trips, etc.		Cons:	-Not as high quality as name brand individual items, but on par with other sets of this sort.		How I rank products (with Amazon's ratings in parenthesis):	* 1 star (I hate it!): I would either return or throw away this product. It was a waste of my money and not functional.	** 2 star (I don't like it): I'm not a fan of this item and I won't order it again, but it has at least one positive quality.	*** 3 star (Its ok): This item has both positive and negative qualities. It may work for some people, but I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase or recommend it.	**** 4 star (I like it): This item arrived and functions as advertised. I would change a few things about this, but is a good product overall. I would use this item.	***** 5 star (I love it!): This item is AWESOME. I will use it and recommend it to others! I just LOVE it! It works as advertised and is an all-around great product.		I received this item for free or at a deeply discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. All opinions shared are completely my own.
0,My daughter broke the original piece off the beloved, fuzz-collecting, Serafina.  The lodged remnant of the ponytail plug in base required an exacto blade to pry out.  This was an excellent replacement.  The parts are flexible and kind of jiggle when she dances.  We could not find an exact replacement part, so I was happy to find this!  It arrived within the advertised time frame.
0,We are not real big on anything not co op. However, we have had a blast playing this one off and on. All decks seem to be  pretty balanced and unique.
0,More darts and a clip are always good for any clip fed boomco blaster!
0,These 12 packs are worth the money in my opinion if you're looking to dress up your home for Halloween.  In each individual pack, you get a strip of webbing that you can easily cover around a 3 square foot area.  And as the package states, the webbing looks better the more your stretch it out.  Not only that, each individual pack comes with two spiders.  They aren't the most realistic spiders, but they look real enough for my purposes.  Plus its nice they have a tiny hook underneath their bodies so they can attach to the webbing better.
0,He loves it and quickly put it together.  May not be much of a challenge for older boys (wasn't for my son) but it is typical great quality Lego product!
0,Beautiful figure. Well made.  Solid. Beautiful.  This is C3PO in SW VII. Hence the red arm.
0,Got this for my niece and she loved it.
0,Great!  My kids (3 year old and 10 month old) love it.  As soon as we put it in their room. They both played on it for a very long time.  The other reviewers who said there is a strong toxic smell are partly true.  I didn't think the smell was toxic and it aired out within a day and both kids are fine.  Highly recommend.  Thanks!
0,We love these.  They are a great quality and we can't wait to use them for Christmas.
0,Highly entertaining for kids of all ages...but my elementary school age boys really seem to have a blast with it. Great idea for a birthday gift!
0,Excellent product and seller I recommend both!
0,Very satisfied
0,This puzzles brings delight every time it is completed correctly.  I have two grandsons, ages 18 mtgs and 3 1/2 yrs; both enjoy this puzzle.
0,This is an awesome play castle. It folds up (think car windshield sun cover) easily and is easy to put up out of the way. It has lasted a month now with an energetic 3 year old playing "Sofia" in it and her over enthusiastic 5 year old brother playing with it to (even when told not to). It is well made. The back to sides that aren't shown are a solid pink with no decoration and it takes a bit of work to fluff out the towers so they sit right but in all it was a good buy. Well worth it.
0,Fun party game alternative to Cards Against Humanity. Also a good conversation starter as in "are you SURE you'd date somebody like that?"
0,My 8 year old son and his friends love this! The 3 levels are challenging enough to keep them playing again and again. Way better than a video game!
0,my grandson was the cutest cowboy in the neighborhood
0,This is a very worthy unauthorized expansion to CAH. Really solid content.
0,My grandchildren totally love playing with them. They even begged me to order more. And i did!
0,Adorable and well made.
0,i had one once and my sister stole it so now that i am an adult i feel the need to replace it.
0,The game itself is great. My wife and I enjoy playing this more than I thought we would. You have to match up two of the three numbers and the first one to get rid of their tri-ominos wins. Pretty straight forward game.		The pieces themselves are very high-quality. They feel like ivory, though I'm sure they're not. There is a little brass tack in the center of each one, which seems pointless, but makes they look/feel nice. The numbers are engraved, so they won't rub off. The plastic trays are nice as well and easily fit 10 tri-ominos on them.		The box itself is really weak though. Its a thin plastic and sags when you hold it. I'm afraid it's not going to last very long. It's so easy to have high quality boxes that it's really disappointing that they went for something so cheap when the rest of the components are really nice. I expect the game to outlast the box.
0,Arrived quickly, well-packed, and as described;  thanks!
0,Came in good condition
0,Interesting to watch the baby interact, colorful
0,My son sucked on the piece and it was a little ruined.  I wish it could stand up to some moisture.  Other than that I love this puzzle.  It helps children make a connection from shapes to the real world.  Great for nurseries and home use.  I love the knobs because they are easy to grasp.
0,We usually buy Copag cards but wow I'm glad we tried these! Great reviews posted here on Amazon. They are definitely thicker and better made than Copag's cards. We've played with them for about two months without needing to change them out. We have weekly games. Will definitely buy again!
0,Looked good for a pirate costume! Had some problems getting it to stand straight but a couple of pins later and we were in business!
0,Love it
0,Excellent game
0,LOVE the tegu toys - only complaint is that my son was able to get the rubber tire off and lose it. Also I got these on a mega Black Friday sale. Usually these are way out of our price range for toys. They're super cool though. Even my two year old enjoys the magnetic blocks more than his megablocks!		Actually one more flaw is the magnets in the wheels aren't strong enough to hold up anything super heavy. You have to be mindful and create very light vehicles otherwise the weight of the vehicle will make it fall to the ground instead of staying lifted onto the wheels. Maybe tegu should consider building some that have a whole axel?
0,my niece did not want to open any more presents until she could put this costume on first and be supergirl to finish opening her Christmas presents!  It was made very well with no itching or scratchy material...a bit sad that she did get the shoes!
0,Got this for my 5 year old great grandson's birthday. The sound effects are so very realistic, so even the adults enjoyed the duo. He loved them, and it seemed like it was his favorite gift. Exceptionally well made. He was very rough with both, but they took the punishment. All the sounds made everyone smile which means they're  not irritating like some toys can be. I even want one.
0,I was a bit reluctant to spend so much money on something like a board game organizer... But with all the add-ons for this game, I finally broke down and ordered it. I have the base game and all the bits and cards from all three expansions -everything, all in the core box nice and neat. The removable trays make all it easy to find everything without sifting through a bunch of bags and boxes. I still can't believe that all the cards fit, even in a full set of premium sleeves.		If you're on the fence about this, take it from a skeptic. Pick it up, follow the assembly instructions to a T, and you'll agree it's absolutely worth it.
0,PLEASE NOTE that if you buy the Edushape alphabet puzzle, you need to buy TWO of these edge packages to cover all the puzzle's edges.  aside from that, these are great and are nice and thick, like the puzzle.
0,Great
0,This game  is a lot of fun! Along with being fun, it really helps with reading readiness. My girls love the Letter Factory movies, so they were excited to play along with their favorite characters. It's very interactive and gets kids excited about letters. Disclosure: I received products for the purpose of review. All opinions are my own.
0,I was concerned about mixing an Enchantress with a Princess, Maiden and some of the other pieces. She looks great with the sorcerer.
0,My 5-year old loves this game! He is really into the ninja turtles right now, but this game is also very age-appropriate for him. He can do almost everything in the game on his own, but it's a step up from the video games he's played before, particularly on LeapPad.		Some of the math questions are a little much for his age, but I like how LeapPad games respond to your child's abilities by making questions easier or harder - and he's asking me more math questions, which is a great thing!		This game uses ImagiCards, which is a collection of cards that interacts with your LeapPad to bring more characters to your games. For our family, this was not really impressive. As a mom, I knew right away that I'd be finding cards all over the house, although a nice metal tin is available to hold cards. My 5-year old wasn't interested in the cards at all. He said the games already had pre-loaded cards, so he didn't care to use them in the games. He did use the cards for other, non-LeapPad, activities, though. :)		This review contains only my opinions. LeapPad provided the LeapPad Platinum and games for my review.

0,Ignore the idiotic reviews that don't focus on the product.	This new line of 1/12 size figures from Mezco is aimed at the audience that buys Hot Toys or Sideshow figures.  Premium figures with amazing articulation and exceptional detail.  This figure is impressive despite it's small size, in fact I find it preferable to the larger 12" figures.  If this line is successful, and next up is Judge Dredd and possibly the Mutant Leader from TDKR it's going to make these first figures in the line very popular among collectors.		Yes, retail on these is $65 so if you want them at that you should pre-order or expect to pay second party prices.  That's how it works.	Everyone who pre-ordered got a figure at retail.	Don't snooze on the rest of the line.
0,loved it
0,These seem to work better than the Aomway antennas I upgraded from.
1,This was NOT an easy toy to put together.  Some of the parts were very hard to get to snap together.  This was frustrating, because it only held my son's attention for an hour and then he stepped on it and it fell apart.  It hasn't been back together since, and he hasn't missed it.  I really regret buying it.
1,These are horrible quality. As soon as I picked them up out of the box 3 brush heads fell on the ground having come unglued from their handles. The brushes are extremely stiff and more brush heads fell off when I took them out of packaging. Junk.
1,This was a waste!  The package looked like it was a return from someone with how messy the packaging was and the tank wouldn't work.  Returned and will not purchase again!
1,Already would not order again
1,it's KO vision !
1,Very small. They are super dainty, as in a fuzzy finger width.
1,Ok
1,We were looking for a bedtime-friendly version of the Baby Einstein take-along-tunes.  Online the product description said that the toy plays music for 6 minutes continuously on lullaby mode which is what I was looking for.  Once we received the toy, the instructions said that it plays for only one minute on one mode and the other mode creates a "symphony" with three touches (but not for 6 minutes).  However, in reality, it only plays each tune for about 10-15 seconds.  And I can't tell any difference between the 2 modes.  That said, our daughter likes the other parts of it that she can chew on, etc.  However, I suggest that you save your money and get the "Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes" which has the same high quality classical music, plays longer and is only about $8.00.  Our daugther LOVES the Baby Einstein and is only marginally interested in this new one.
1,I was looking for clothes for a 15" doll and when I searched this came up. The clothes are beautiful, nicely made, but do not fit a 15 inch doll.  I think a 13" doll would be the right size.  The sleeper couldn't be buttoned, and the tights kept coming down.  We were disappointed that it was recommended for a 15" doll.
1,Terrible. Makes the Vision hard to fly in the wind
1,These are regular small-sized marbles. Not shooter size. Did not meet my needs - I was making a marble run for young children (see my post at gooddayswithkids.com to learn more) and wanted non-swallowable size marbles.
1,I was so excited for this product, it came on time and was well packaged. But unless you are in a pitch black room and hold the whole thing up high to the ceiling, its hard to even see what was drawn. The top piece falls off easily and the markers are very faint when drawn on to the plastic.
1,I purchased this for my sons birthday.  Put it all together and then nothing.  The motor rotates with the weight but it won't spin in a circle.  I followed the directions on how the pens and arms are to be positioned and yeah it just sits there.  If someone contacts me and tells me that I am doing something wrong I will consider changing my review but I expected it would at least draw a damn circle.
1,Suction cups don't stick. Makes using it pointless.
1,Missing days, my daughter was so sad to open up the 8 and 15 with nothing in the boxes. Nothing shifted. Just a shifty seller.
1,My granddaughter has no interest in these. Have tried for 2 months and she just doesn't like them
1,Very cheaply made. Kids are not able play on it. Strings are getting loose every time you use it.
1,Air come out somewhere, we did not even have chance using it. Poor quality.
1,kids love the toy
1,This was terribly painted.  You can't even tell that it's a moose.  Having said that you can't really tell what the rest of the animals are either unless you've seen the image on the site.  If I can figure out how to send it back I will.
1,Awful! Ours was not magnetic no matter what. And while stretching it, it dropped down to my son's shirt, stuck and leaned on our couch. Our couch is ruined! This expensive piece of junk putty ruined my new son! Bright sparkly pink on my powder blue sofa. Does not come out as per their directions on the website and even stained the cloth and scrubbing brush I used with the alcohol! Wish I never bought this terrible product; I warn you, buyer beware!
1,Neat trick but the directions are horrible. They don't make any sense. My husband had to look this trick up on you tube in order to know how to do it. He is able to goof around with this but it's not what I expected.
1,For jumbo rocks, they were very small, very disappointed do not buy them the pic is deceiving
1,Wanted to live this but it just didn't work out well.. First off I got this band over others like it for the container. It seemed like a good idea as it wild not fall apart like cardboard. Sadly the top does not stay on at all. It literally falls off when turned upside down with nothing in it!	As for the chairs they are cheap plastic as to be expected. However they seemed like there was some kind of oily feel to them? When my kids dumped them out every fuzzy they touched stuck to them. Now we just washed them with a little soap and hot water to fix that. The only problem is even after all that is really and I mean REALLY hard to play the game. Even adults playing it had a hard time stacking more then like 4 chairs. Our kids, 5 and 7 just could not play it.. :(
1,My son (2 years old) begged for this toy.  He's a big Sesame Street fan and it looked pretty fun on the package.  When we got it home, we discovered the parts DO NOT stay together.  At all.  We put on the legs, the head came off.  We put on the body, the legs fell off.  My son tried and tried to build his Elmo, and it finally ended in tears of frustration.	Please do not waste your money on this toy, or any of the other Sesame St. building sets.  I had bought grover and oscar at the same time, and of course they all have the same connection problem.
1,Bracelet is hard as a rock and huge. My four year old couldn't wear it.  She did like the extra bracelet what came with it, but they don't hold the picture charms.
1,Got as a present for 2.5 year old.	It took 1 hr to put it together  what a pain!!!!!		My son lost interested in it 5 minutes after it was put together. I think it will be better suited for 1.5 year old. I do not understand how recommended age is up to 5 However, be advised that all construction is not made of hard plastic ( read: if your 1.5 year old will try to lean on it its not going to be good.)		I would not recommend this item but if you buy it, advice to parents to assemble it before showing it to a child ( toddlers patience level does not warrant 1 hr assembly)
1,I could not believe how awful this puzzle set smelled.  I know it seems odd, but good grief you could smell it from down the hall. The puzzle pieces are difficult to fit together, the "wood" splinters, and it is a thin paper to the wood combo.  Perhaps it is the adhesive that puts off that horrible oder, whatever it is it is going back to the store.  If you want a quality puzzle that will last through a couple of kids try Ravensburger puzzles.
1,The suction cup is horrible, does not stick for more then a few seconds. The toy is off balanced and will not spin more then a half spin. Be careful of the black and white part/spinning toy, fingers can get caught not much clearance room between the two parts. It removes from the suction base, so baby can just pull it right off. It is NOT easy to clean and has creepy music!
1,no!
1,This is the cheapest cloth you will ever find.  Not worth the money at all. The mark up must be 6 billion percent.  Not even sure it's nine inches
1,My 9 yr old son loved this, but within a moth or so after purchasing, the hinge on the bottom which reveals the battery panel cracked and broke.  That was also part of the base which held it securely in place on the wall, so it was short-lived.
1,There is not enough force from the rear propeller to get this thing going.		It's also quite unstable.		Try to find a Youtube video of this in action.  Exactly, it doesn't work at all.
1,This thoy, like ALL her little friends, loose their hands, their legs BREAK OFF, and the arms that are 'removeable', come out and are hard for even ME as a MOM to put in, and they do NOT stay in!!!I think they come with stands so you can just DISPLAY THEM!!!DO NOT over pay for these toys that Mattel refuses to STOP making have removeable parts. Barbies, at least can last for a LONG time (generation to generation even!)AND are worth the money! MATTEL FIX THE MONSTER DOLLS!!!!
1,This material is really cheap and thin so it is a little tricky to get it laid out properly. It became fuzzy very quickly and because if the material it picked up and retained every piece of hair from the day care. Gross!!
1,I love the Leatherback figure, its very well made, and feels and looks expensive. However Gipsy looks cheap, is too thin, and doesn't even stand on his own well. I also have the Striker Eureka figure and this Gipsy looks like so much poorly made when comparing them, its unbillable they are from the same brand.
1,The picture this seller provided is rather misleading. I did not get receive any stamps but got 1 coil spring and 2 out of 12 wind-up toys are defective.  It's a shame coz' I really love those little wind-up toys.. Not so recommended as far as what I've received.
1,Material is very cheap, one broke after less than a week. You get what you pay for I guess. Pretty dresses though otherwise and daughter still loves them.
1,It smells very disgusting. That smells cause headaches.		If you think about your children's health, it is not good for you.
1,Product was fun but cheap and did not last long.  The part you step on to launch the rockets lacks pressure.  It takes an adult to launch it any real distance.
1,I am so disappointed with this thing. I got it thinking it was a good way to have our preschooler be able to read books in the car. Unfortunately this thing only hold about 3 books on it at a time and the batteries run out so fast! I would never buy this again it was a good concept but not worth the money.
1,Not happy with the quality of this backdrop! Plastic, tore easily! Wouldn't recommend at all.
1,Cute but not bouncy
1,When the blocks arrived, I felt it was not appropriate for a 4 year old. I thought the packaging was lacking to give it as a gift. Very disappointed with this purchase.
1,Poor quality.  One of the dragons only had 3 legs.  We convinced my son that that dragon was wounded in a fight.
1,Arrived broken. Microphone does not work. For nearly $40 this is not ok. Merry Christmas. :-/
1,I was very disappointed in this stick horse. I gave it to my daughter for her birthday a few weeks ago and about 2 weeks after she got it the audio for the horse neighing stopped working. Shes only used it a few times. I realize that the sound will go eventually but I expected it to last longer than a couple weeks w/a tiny bit of use! And there are no returns after 30 days and since I bought it as a gift and gave it to her 3 weeks later can't return it.
1,Let me start by saying I try to be very fair in my reviews. I'm sorry but there's nothing good I can say about this item. First the pictured item is a tan or sunburst color but the one I received was pink. The description says assorted colors but you can't choose between them. This was ordered for a 6yr old  boy so the pink one I received was not a good choice. Next, the anchor at the bottom for the strings was completely detached from the body. Lastly, it is very VERY small.	We decided to glue it back together and give it to our 2yr old girl as a toy but definitely would not order again.	If you're looking for a kids starter guitar, I highly recommend you keep looking.
1,Received this as a gift (along with a couple of metal earth models) - Noticed immediately that the teeth / jaws of both pliers didn't fit together and completely close / fit flush.  Never used them because of this. I wanted to return these but haven't had an opportunity to speak with Amazon customer service due to several family and work issues.  I highly advise getting smaller tools for ME models from your local hardware or hobbyist store.
1,useless, didn't work at all, came while I was OOT so not returnable. They just did not cut cleanly. Crushed, not cut. Other reviews say they are great so perhaps I got a bad pair?
1,my son insisted we get this "girly" race track for his 4 year old cousin for her birthday.		This track is basically the same in terms of set up and quality as most "do it yourself" race tracks for matchbox sized cars. Which means, for those who have never owned one of these sets, it will be cumbersome to put together, with loads of small pieces, and pieces that seem to fit together but don't.  Then once you finally figure out which track piece goes where, it will fall apart. All the time. You will constantly have to reassemble the track.  It will not store easily, or move easily, or last very long. But, when it does work, your kid will LOVE it. S/he will love to watch the cars zoom around the track, loop the loop, and even fly off into a crash.		As I mentioned, we gave this as a gift to my niece on her 4th birthday. She had her dad put it together immediately. It took maybe 30 minutes to figure out how to put it together. Then it worked for 15 minutes before it broke. We fixed it 3 times while I was there.  The kids had a blast with it. But I still felt embarrased that I had given such a flimsy gift.		As much fun as this was to play with, the quality was just so bad that I don't recommend it. I do recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Shake-N-Go-Crash-Ups-Crash-Course/dp/B000NW2AMG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Shake 'N Go Crash-Ups Crash Course</a>&nbsp;which is a much sturdier race track.  It's not pink and girly, but if you are looking for a quality track for your child to race and crash cars, it's much better. If you are looking for something more girly, I'd haven't seen any other girl themed race tracks but do recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Polly-Pocket-Fab-Tastic-Mall/dp/B0016BVN6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Polly Pocket Fab-Tastic Mall</a>
1,They were shorter than stock original pushrods.
1,This racing track is actually a good bit of fun - or at least it would be if it came with all the pieces. For $25 you only get half the product. Which is to say, two tracks and one car. If it had two cars, it would be much better. If it had all three tracks and three cars, it may actually be worth the asking price. This is a cute simple toy, but hey, kids like simple toys. Just be warned that if you buy it, be prepared to end up spending another $20 or so on the rest of the pieces.		Here's my pros and cons:		PROS:	- The lengthy track leads to an exciting finish. It is especially thrilling to see the flag shoot up when the winning car passes the finish line.		- Sound effects are a nice bonus. To start the race you press a button on the side which emits a nice sound effect, and also pushes the cars forward so they all start at the same time. I think this is especially nice!		- Fairly easy to put together.		CONS:	- Hard to store. When you want to put this track away you're dealing with a 3+ foot long mess. Yes, you can take it apart to make for easy storage. But, let's face it, who wants to play with a toy you have to assemble each time? At my house we call those toys "junk."		- Expensive. Assuming you buy the rest of the parts, we're dealing with a $50 slope for cars to slide down. Really?		- Quickly lose interest. The lacking bells and whistles makes this toy thrill-less quite fast. Had the cars slid down a circular slope or bumpy slope or something to make it more interesting I think it would have been better. I don't know much about this toy, but it seems a much more interesting version of the same idea:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Tonka-Wheel-Pals-Triple-Track-Tower/dp/B000BCEJ9A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Tonka Wheel Pals Triple Track Tower</a>		Overall I do think this toy has potential. Youngsters will no doubt be mesmerized by the action-reaction elements of the flag lifting and car rolling and built up momentum, but I just don't understand why they think they can sell a product that is missing important pieces. I think it's ridiculous.
1,You gave about 70 stickers to apply to this. For the price of this it should be complete. You gave to completely open to add stickers to make it presentable for a child.  The images and descriptions don't let you know you have to add these to the toy.
1,EDIT:  You can battle two MiPosaurs but the controls are so bad it only occasionally works and it's extremely frustrating.  We have two so I'm pretty sure we didn't just get "duds."		It does help somewhat to turn wifi off while playing.  Even while it's off and more responsive, single control does nothing and dual control is extremely difficult.		I am also returning the MIP robot because it's just kind of lame and doesn't do what it's supposed to do either.	These were a major disappointment.		Original review:		Cool but hard to control with iPad.  My kids seem to like anyway.		One major drawback that may have caused me to reconsider buying - you can't seem to battle two MiPosaurs!  Plus, if two are played with in a room together they get confused and the controls from their respective balls affect both MiPosaurs.		Wish they were more clear about this fact.  We even bought a MiP robot so we could battle but the MiPosaur seems much more powerful and takes out the robot very quickly.  Not a fair fight and not much fun.		P.S. The robot is much easier to control via the app than the MiPosaur.
1,The leg broke off within five minutes of my son playing with it.
1,Not worth the money.  Cheap plastic toy.  Not much to it.
1,I'll echo everyone else - great idea, but very poorly designed.  It's unstable so it frequently topples over onto the slide side.  Additionally, the slide comes off constantly.  I have 2 boys <5 years old & they play with it all the time.  When they're actively playing with it, I am asked practically nonstop to fix the slide that falls off almost as quickly as I get it back on.
1,JUNK!!!!!!  Terrible product. I purchased this in June 2017 for my Grandchild's visit.  Used once and put away until he visited today, Sept 2017,  the seams gave out in 3 places.  I just threw away 200.00 after two uses. No wonder the return window is so small. JUNK!!!!
1,Don't bother!
1,Extremely disappointed in this item.		I bought this for my four year old after seeing it several times in a target store- it was the one thing she wanted for her birthday. Out of the box it worked for about 10 minutes of gentle play before it started to get "stuck" and now stays in that stuck position. This ends up sounding like yelps in a small infinite loop and is only stopped if you hit his head against a hard surface with a lot of force- something we couldn't do more than a few times because it really upset my daughter. Needless to say, my daughter is very distraught but doesn't want to give her pup up because "we already adopted this one"- they are so sweet at four. Basically I paid $55 for a stuffed animal because it now sits without batteries.		JUNK.
1,Bought this for a gift and the containers just came in a brown box. Looks cheap. Very disappointed.
1,This toy cheaply made and constructed.  The little cars FREQUENTLY (more times than not) get stuck when they drop onto a lower track.  My daughter got this for Christmas when she was 9 months old (I know..small parts...we supervise her closely when she plays with this).  She was able to put the cars on the tracks at 10 months.  This toy holds her attention for about 2 car drops; then she's off.  And while I realize that babies don't have that long of an attention span, she will sit and play with puzzles, crayons, and stacking toys for MUCH longer.  This toy is a boring piece of junk!

1,This is a very cool concept...especially for a kid like my son who is really into animals and their origins and habitats.  Santa was super excited to put this out for him on Christmas Eve and upon removing it from the box, found that all of the tiny magnet animals were dislodged and it was a huge MESS.  It would have taken at least 30 minutes to an hour for my husband and I to put it back together, which we were prepared to do.  Then we looked closer and saw that there were about 8 glue globs that appeared to be holding the plastic to the board and that had all become dislodged and had ripped off the map paper background.  We were very disappointed as we had gotten this to go with an animal atlas for Christmas.  Obviously sent it back.
1,Spilled out & soaked it's own box. Had to return it....
1,This doll is worth 10 bucks at the most.  The material it is made of is cheap like felt.  Mine didn't  work so I returned it and amazon  processed my refund quickly.  I think a boy would get bored of this toy quickly.
1,These guys are terrible. Yes, they bare some semblance to their characters Rumble and Ravage, but emphasis on SOME. Start with Ravage - head and front legs - so-so. Looks a little more bat-like than jaguar/puma, but meh, ok. Then you look at his back legs. Yuck! Even in the stock photo it looks terrible. Very awkward tail section that is mostly empty/sticks up weird.	And Rumble - my goodness. If "Rumble" does not come with his massive arm-mounted piston-y attachments that he pounds the ground with, thus causing the ground to "rumble," then how is he Rumble?? He is a generic looking robot who transforms into a data disk.	Laserbeak isn't much better, but at least he comes with the actual Soundwave toy. These two guys are not worth it unless you are so SUPER diehard in which case you should probably wait for the Masterpiece version. Seriously, not to burst anyone's bubble, but these are lame. I can't imagine a kid or adult getting much entertainment from them. Don't buy unless it's like 5 or 6 bucks including shipping. As someone else already stated Toys R Us has them for 10.99 and we all know Toys R Us is no bargain, they usually overprice everything by a few bucks.
1,As much as I trim it, this thing always goes forward. To stop it I have to pull it back almost all the way back. This lil toy is garbage or just defective. Idk,  I still haven't heard a reply.
1,I've purchased many "flying gadgets" thru the years and this certainly ranks as "one of them" we bought it for a Christmas present as Our 5yo daughter specifically requested a "flying unicorn" from Santa this year, not really sure how we were going to pull that off I simply typed flying unicorn into Google and low an behold up pops this "flying remote controlled unicorn" on amazon. The good part it's not overly expensive, if you buy enough batteries of the right type you can charge it up and be flying in about a Half hour. The bad part is it's just like most light weight inexpensive flying toys it works well for about the first 3 uses and then with each crash it becomes more unbalanced and less accurate. It wrapped up my daughters hair on one flight and we had to cut it out of her hair after that not much damage or hair loss but also not the "magical flying unicorn" experience I think she was imagining. 4 stars for amazon on having enough variety that I could fulfill the technical requirements of my daughters letter to Santa. 2 stars for the flying unicorn, this is a one and done disposable toy. It's not likely to last beyond the first set of batteries, and probably hurt Santas elves reputation for making quality toys, I'll tell her it was my fault someday. For the rest of you it's a great gag gift or a single rainy day gymnasium toy but not hearty enough to survive the rigors of flight.
1,Unfortunately the people over at "Little Tikes" don't have a quality control department because this thing is woefully out of tune! The included simple songs don't sound right at all. Being a musically-inclined person myself (cellist) it is almost painful to listen to this horrible sounding scale.
1,Summary: the width of the fingers is to skinny, the length of the fingers is too long.	No complaints about quality - it is a toy glove. My complaint is the size for my kid. My 5 yr old kindergartner, who is on the tall/skinny side, had a terrible time getting these on his hands. He certainly couldn't put them on alone. Once we got one of them "kinda-sorta" on his left hand, after much wiggling and working together, the fingers were way too long. I measured these gloves un-stretched, and the fingers are almost exactly 1" in diameter, which is 1/2 inch when laying flat. I measured a #2 pencil here at the house, and yep, that is just about the right size. The gloves do stretch both long and wide, I could get my pinki in it, but trying to push a kid's fingers into a glove that HAS to stretch to get it on him, well, is very frustrating for both kid and parent (brought back memories of watching OJ!).
1,I did some research about this toy and read many negative reviews of how it lacks in quality.  My 8 yr old had this up at the top of her list and wanted it anyways so I gave in and bought it.  I put in fresh batteries, it blinked the screen and then stopped working.  I would not recommend this toy.  My daughter was so disappointed, she almost cried on her birthday.  This was her "big gift" and needless to say, I was not happy that it didn't even deliver for one day.  It takes 3 AAA batteries, installed with a small screwdriver.  My kids have had the Nintendo DS Lite for a couple of years with no problems, better graphics and an internal rechargeable battery.
1,I love Hape toys.  I have the red mini van, the little blue airplane, the block-stacker train and several other hape toys.  I love them all!		Sadly this one is disappointing.  Like another reviewer, I thought the circle in the sail was a hole, its not, it is a glass mirror on both sides.  I'm not sure how securely its attached, but on mine there is a gap in between one of the mirrors and the wooden sail.  This makes me concerned that the mirror could fall out and be a choking hazard.  Also the mirror seems unfinished on the edges so it could also be a sharp cutting hazard.  Not to mention, what about when this thing hits the floor?  Is the mirror going to break into a bunch of pieces?  Cute design but doesn't seem safe for a baby.		2 stars for cuteness (as a decoration or perhaps for older children)	minus 3 stars for safety
1,Does it work
1,Not a very interesting toy.  hard to keep the pieces together.
1,These bubble wands are attractive and you think they'll be great, but they're not.  The bubbles that come out of them are not well formed and some wand shapes barely work at all.
1,The holes are a little small. After 2 months a couple are leaking around the seal. A couple had the leftover plastic from the hole inside them that clogged the hole and I had to dig it out. But not a bad price.
1,These decks are shorter than a regular deck of cards. Also they will not slide when you deal them out. They stop as soon as they hit the table, as though they are some how slip resistant.
1,It's awesome !!! BUT I bought this exact one at Walmart for $11!!!!
1,Didn't meet my expectation. I had bought a few other doll outfits from the same company that were great; however I found this one to be lacking in quality and craftsmanship. When I showed it to my 11yr old she was very excited to see a Horse Outfit:, but even she noticed problems with the outfit as she dressed the doll. The pants are difficult to take on and off, the area in the legs are tight and she really had to pull, and patches around the pants had some loose stitching around patches. She said the boots were hard too, part of it is the soft material of them which is a bit understandably put if you look at the attached picture the sewing around the zipper just looks terrible. Also the riding jacket has two issues, the sleeves are longer then doll arms and one side of the jacket is longer looking giving a lopsided appearance. The ridging crop that came with the doll though was cute and nicely made and helped pull the whole outfit together. Disclosure: I did receive this item at a discount for a fair and honest review.
1,I wouldn't order again.  All three were the same character.
1,Garbage Theory are not very good they are loose connection
1,Track is cheeply made and didn't last long. Cars are also cheep and one never worked.
1,The worst thing I have ever ordered on Amazon. They look nothing and I mean nothing like the picture. I will be returning them
1,Unfortunately it did not work . Appeared rotor shaft was broken internally. I returned it.
1,I agree with other reviews. I brought this product for my 2 year old twins for bath play. I know it is aged for 24 mos+, but i think that it needs to be at least 3+. It is made of foam which tears and rips at the hands of toddlers. And they love to bite the pieces which are now missing several chunks. Again i realize this is due to them being a little too young for this product, just still wanted to mention. The 'spots' do not disappear at all. The water has to be absolutely scalding hot for them to go away, which is completely unreasonable for bath temperature for toddlers. Very disappointed, but my twins still like putting them in and out of the 'drying rack' and pretending they are dishes, so we let them play with them as they want. They definitely like playing with them, but it is me as the parent who is disappointed. The concept is very good, but it just doesnt work.  I would not recommend this or buy again.
1,Just out of the box and the only letter it recognizes is the letter "A", regardless of the different letters we have placed on the scale Read and followed instructions to no avail. Will be contacting the company to see what they recommend.		I called the 800 number for the Vtech company. After going through some troubleshooting the rep informed me that the toy could not be fixed and then said that I needed to contact Amazon to return it because that is where I bought it from. So after a fifteen minute wait, another ten for troubleshooting and then five while the rep consulted his manager, I circled back to Amazon. Printing out the label and returning tomorrow.		Received second toy and could not believe that it has the same issues as first. This time returning for refund. Always had good luck with Vtech in the past but this toy is a no go for us!
1,I've played Battleship before at a family member's house.  They had an older traditional version of the game with two separate cases, nice quality, etc.  I loved playing it.  My 8-year-old son enjoyed playing it with me, so I suggested that to my mother as a birthday present.  Unfortunately, I didn't know there were different versions these days.		In this version, there is a single 2-sided console that the two players share.  Unfortunately, the pegs and ships do not fit well into the holes, and since the board is vertical, they frequently fall out.  If someone lightly brushes against a peg, it will fall out.  If you look at a peg, it may fall out.  The whole point is to be able to mark your misses and hits, and if you don't know what you've already guessed, what's the point?  I was almost in tears with frustration after only 5-10 minutes of play.  Sadly, this is a cheaply designed game that is not ready to be on the broader market.		On a side note, this version has a hexagon grid, so that there are more options as to how to orient your boats.  In my mind, it makes the game a bit more complex, especially for children, and I prefer the traditional board with rows and columns.		Battleship is a great game, but do not buy this version.
1,I read reviews online about what toys were good to buy for a year old baby.  Ball poppers were at the top of the list.  Must have been the other ball popper!!  We put the toy together, and turned it on.  She fairly shrieked until we turned it off. Tried it several times with the same result.  The popper really does make a loud noise as it's trying to pop the balls.  It's so loud in fact that it drowns out the music.  This was her first birthday present from me, so I'm very disappointed in it:(.  She seems to like playing with it (for like 5 minutes) as she manually drops the balls in.  Will let her play with it manually for awhile and try again.
1,I purchased this toy based on the great reviews for my son's first birthday.  He does not care about this toy in the least.  He never picks it up to play with it.  He would much rather play with "guys" or cars.  Looking back I wish I would have purchased the "dog" version of this toy as he may have had a little more interest in it.  That said, it really is a beautiful, well-made, "no batteries" toy, just not enjoyed in my house.
1,I ordered this for my niece, but was really disappointed. It's hard plastic and when you shake it, the mouth opens and then slams shut while Mickey utters mostly partial phases, most of which you can't understand. It's just awful.
1,Having purchased the Batgirl and Wonder Woman statues in this series and being very happy with both, this one was a major disappointment. The paint job was terrible. The sculpt of the face and hair very unrealistic and unappealing. I was so unhappy with this product that I returned it.
1,It was a present for my Granddaughter for being brave for getting her required kindergarten immunizations. It was defective out of the package. I did contact the seller and they offered to make it good if I returned the defective product. Since it had been a gift and they did not keep it, I was out of the money. Very expensive lesson.  Don't buy this one. This is the second one and the first did not last too long with a 5 year old. Great and fun idea but needs to be more durable.
1,I was expecting something else.  First it was suppose to be 12 inch, but it was not the arms and legs kept falling off.  I think what he like the most is that the mouth open and  closed.
1,Delivery was very slow and not in time for the party.  Not as exciting as it looks in the picture.  I would not order again.
1,These were HORRIBLE!!! 11 of them didn't work! And yes, I know how to turn them on.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!!
1,Made out of foam and child tore I apart on day one . Wish it were made of rubber instead like other models we own
1,Mask is terrible, suffocating, and impossible to see through. Do not buy it if you want to be able to see while wearing your mask. The sight holes are in the nose and mouth FYI and they do not work at all.  We put them on, and stumbled in blindly to a party, immediately took them off, and will likely never wear them again.
1,My 2 year old daughter loves Doc and I couldn't wait to add the big book of boos to her collection - but this item fell short. It wasn't put together well  - looked pretty cheap compared to other items in the Doc collection.
1,The positioning of the tail caused my daughter to trip and fall multiple times. The costume is lovely but could be designed better.
1,After just now reading so many reviews, one would think the pictures of multiple stands would be changed. Disappointed to get only one stand. Getting ready for a doll show and now have to order more stands.  Shipping on product was great and timely.
1,This toy is a box full of tiny pieces ready to be lost.  The songs and theme are all about pet fashion and glamour.  I know it is a grooming shop but could not be more frivolous and insulting to little girls (and to groomers!).  Why not Minnie the vet?
1,waste of money
1,The hip to thigh joint was bad. It was stiff and it broke as soon as I moved it. No wonder they stopped this line. I returned it the next day.
1,Description is that it's a pop up castle... it's really a prop up castle using fiberglass rods to keep the unit erect. Disappointing and in my opinion a danger for children who may rough house.
1,We LOVE little people...but not this one.  Save your money and buy a different set.  This comes in a huge box for some reason but is only what is pictures and keeps her entertained for about 5 minutes.  Unlike a farm or playground or castle little people set there isn't anything to do but play the birthday song and play with the chairs and I think she is more imaginative with the other sets.  I highly recommend the little people happy home (even with no batteries still lots of fun), school bus, or barn.  If you are looking for something in the same price range, I recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/dp/B00SO7HLL2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fisher-Price Little People Jump & Play Swing Set</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Fisher-Price-Little-People-Lil-Movers-Airplane/dp/B012BIBLI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fisher-Price Little People Lil' Movers Airplane</a>. She would have preferred just a set of people to this I think.
1,Great
1,I bought this for my granddaughter, she is 7 yrs old, she said the soda is gummy and when you try to use the tiny straws that came with it there is no way it will come up the straw. It tastes awful.  I do not recommend buying this product.
1,When I received it, it was not packaged well so it was smashed. It was an inexpensive item, so not a big loss. Still not as I expected. You will get what you pay for. It works even though I was unable to put it back into its original condition.
1,Sent back for refund. This is huge. My son always wants to play with my real tape measure so I thought this would be perfect since it's plastic. Wrong, wrong, wrong. It was so big, it was to unrealistic and my son would t play with it.
1,I was missing over half of these and I am very unhappy about this!
1,It's good,I like this.
1,Great price, but cheap crayons. They are too waxy (I know!) and don't have enough pigment in them. When they were used, they flaked off and got all over his hands and face. He had to keep coloring over the same spot for the color to be true. It wasn't worth the energy. I washed him up and tossed them in the trash.	We will not re-order.
1,I thought that these figures were directly related the to Fisher Price Imaginext Pirate Ship. It just isn't so. Very disappointed that I just bought another senseless plastic item that doesn't work with the toy that I had wanted it to.
1,Not much to do with it. The car carrier only stays inplace if a little wooden shim is inplace. My two year old does not know how to place it and it often gets lost. Without the shim and the cars in their place the carrier just collaspses flat.
1,Unfortunately this doesn't work very well. Cute idea, but the cars have to be pushed around the track and they tumble off the slide. (They do not roll down as they should).
1,The car is cute.  It is not a real Porsche as advertised.  It says Moderno all over it.  The pink color is not the dark/hot pink color pictured but more of a light pink, but still cute.  The lights on the tires are super bright.  My biggest complaint is that NEITHER the USB and TDF card reader work.  The songs pre-loaded are awful and have a foreign accent.  For a $300 car, the USB and TDF card reader should both work. I have not tried the auxillary cord.  Also, the remote is incredibly cheaply made with a some random cat design on it.  If you are going to spend this kind of money for a toy card, I would look elsewhere.
1,If I could give this a zero. I would. I bought my daughter all of the star darlings after we donated some old dolls. She got the whole new set of star darlings for Christmas. We took one out of the package and lost an arm. Next she lost the legs within an hour from another doll. She isn't rough iwth these dolls, but it seems like the joins just fall apart. They are attached by thin plastic. It must be the way they designed the doll. It's two days after Christmas and I'm fairly sure the packaging is all gone so there is no chance of a refund. Do not buy these dolls.
1,These are pretty terrible as boats go.  They tip over, they don't link together.  They take on water.  The kids like the colors and the fact that they stack, but they're still pretty disappointing.
1,My five year old had this toy less than five minutes and is now missing a HUGE CHUNK of her hair because it was caught in the propeller.  DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM.  If you have one, THROW IT OUT.  IT IS DANGEROUS!
1,Wow! I must have really over looked the description part telling how not so big this mini thing is! Far cry from the size they were when I was a kid. My boys love it - but it could be a lot more fun if it were bigger than the palm of your hand!
1,My daughter enjoys feeding the discs to the hippo which is the only reason I gave it more than one star but it has a serious flaw! It gets the discs wrong. It's teaching the wrong colors and shapes and foods from the pictures on the disc. She puts in the red one and it says blue. She puts in the circle and it says square. Gives it the yellow cheese and it says blueberries yum... You get the picture. Not happy with this purchase. Would not recommend.
1,do not buy one small lego figure for these amounts.  It's ridiculous and your kid will lose the parts in days.
1,Typical cheap plastic party bag favors
1,Really wanted this to work for grandson but I'm sure we'll find a better one ,this came with some problems , looks like we had a winner ,not so .
1,I purchased this little 'jet' quadcopter thinking it would be fun to fly around inside.  Now, I have flown countless quads, from micros to larger size.  In this price range, there are many much better choices!  From the Hubsan X4, Blade Nano QX, and Cherrson CX10, there are awesome options!  That being said, this review is about this quad, so lets get into it.		Flight modes, it has 3.  In low and medium rates sometimes the 'jet' wouldn't go forward at all!  It would sometimes, then othertimes even with full forward stick it would struggle to move.  In high rates, it flew ok; however, I wouldn't call high rates, high rates... I would call their high rates, low rates.  The rate settings are simply horrible, there is simply no high rate, just extremely low, very low, and low.  Some interference happens from time to time and the quad will kind of twitch.  The flips actually work well.  Push in on the right stick then push it a direction and the quad will flip.  It has plenty of power for this and performs the tricks well.		Charge time is nowhere near their description stated 9min charge gives 6-7mins of flight.  Charge time is more around 30+ minutes for a 4minute flight.  Which is fine, that is pretty standard actually.  So don't lie, just tell the truth.		All in all, other than having a jet body cool factor, the quad itself flies very poor.  This is my 2nd attempt at a micro from top race, both have been major disappointments.
1,For the money I would hope that the product could withstand mixing easy bake oven mixes but it couldn't. It is very delicate and will stop working if you out anything in the bowl. The battery life is good but I wouldn't purchase it again or recommend it to anyone
1,I bought these for work so our employees could go dance on the sidewalk after dark and get us some more customers.  Problem is that about 1/4 of them don't work right out of the box.  That makes it quite costly when you are talking 75% success rate.  I won't be buying them again and will be searching for a higher quality alternative.

It's just not a well made toy and the "game" isn't much fun. Plus it is way overpriced. I know the box is big, but this shouldn't cost more than $15 and then only for big time fans of the TV show.
1,Magnets are too small for the letters.  They slowly slide down the magnetic board. Very dissapointing.
1,hard as rock, not fun to play with
1,Waste of my money
1,Broke the first day we had it. It was cool while it lasted, but not very durable.
1,deflated the first time i opened it out of the box...
1,These were ok. Everytime a child would reach in and get one, the small sloshing of the water would make a few ducks turn over revelling the drawing on the bottoms. Wished they came with pictures already on the bottoms because we had to draw them with a paint pen. One duck had some major paint bleeding from the beak  causing it to look really bad and kids could easily pick it out if they got the matching drawing and remembered it from a previous play. I wouldn't purchase again.
1,way to small was not happy with them, so I gave them to a small child
1,The ramp falls apart all the time I would not recomend this item to anyone it is not worth it if you are constantly having to fix the ramp.
1,Didnt care for this product. Was messy (very sticky) and after a while it doesnt work as well. It didn't work great from the beginning to start. The colors were very faint
1,Not good track connections and magnets are weak. Cheap set that is frustrating to use.
1,Junk
1,I very rarely give 1 star reviews, because usually there is something redeemable about it. Unfortunately, not in this case. I had an original stomp rocket back when I was 13 that was produced with high-quality materials. This is made of INCREDIBLY CHEAP plastic, tubing, etc. This may be one of the most disappointing products I have ever seen, compared to what it used to be. Ironically, I contacted my mother and she had the original one in her basement. I had her ship that to me, and it still works as good as it did 15 years ago!  The version that I just purchased through Amazon is a complete waste of money.		Before my mom told me she still had the old one, I seriously contemplated going to Lowe's and building my own. I strongly suggest buying the rockets, but building one yourself. It will be a fun project for you and your kids, and it will be a far superior product for not too much more money.
1,The toy Superman from Target has more articulation and durability than this one... If the uploaded picture comes through, you'll see the left foot is broken. I literally had it out of the box for less than 5 minutes before it broke. I currently have it taped back on for fear of losing it, but it broke because it's nearly impossible to move any of the body parts! I can't even bend the arms at the elbows, and I fear I will break it should I give it more force than I currently am putting on it. Also, the black coloring is extremely poor quality... it's rubbing off on the top of the head just from me trying to move the limbs. I will be contacting the sellers to see what my refund/return options are. I will be looking for another action figure option.
1,assumed already put together
1,It's cute but no volume control. Also, the car died (even with new batteries) and didn't respond to the remote.  It was fun while it lasted not even a month.
1,Tore up pretty fast and then I was irritated to realize they sell these same swords at the $.99 cent Only store for guess what.....$1 each!!! I overpaid and ended up replacing days later anyway.
1,Wack
1,Broke the day I recieved it after opening the package! I was just squeezing it for the first time and I wasn't even squeezing it that much, then it broke open.
1,Doesn't work. Couldn't return it because it was a gift and the buyer had it for over 30 days before we received it as a gift. The volume only worked for about five minutes total and it completely gave out. It was in perfect condition and nothing happened to it. It just stopped working. We did everything to try to get it to work again but, it is broken. It was bought from Amazon.
1,2 rings broken as soon as my daughter opened this on Xmas day. Junk. Skip this monster high item. Cheap.
1,We bought this for our children, but it really doesnt have the right parts for kids. The instructions suggest not to use the grip balls for beginners, so you are only left with 4 pieces to actually use. The line is essentially a slack line for your arms with loops for accessories.  We were hoping this would be fun, but the kids all complained about getting blisters & it being too far for them to reach. The adults equally had a challenging time using this. Perhaps yall could make 1 for children & another for adults with varying accessories to accomodate ages & skill levels. I think the Ninja Line should come with enough attachments that beginners can actually use to have plenty of opportunities to develop their skill.
1,DISAPPOINTING! So angry right now because we purchased TWO light sabers AS ADVERTISED, but when we opened the package, we found ONE Saber and one empty bubble wrap sleeve. Thanks for the gift of my two children's crestfallen, disappointed faces, blue green novelty. Wish we could give you fewer than one star. The one existing light saber is cheap and flimsy. Buyer, pay a little more elsewhere and get a more reliable, quality product.
1,This toy is terrible. The battery compartment cover broke the first time we opened it, so we had to tape the batteries in. It can only hold a very tiny amount of bubble solution. It is noisy. Lastly, most importantly, it doesn't even blow bubbles very well! In about 30 minutes of my 3 & 4 year olds trying, we got it to spit out bubbles three times. Each time produced about 10 very tiny bubbles. I want to say thank goodness this was a gift so we didn't waste our money on it, but I feel bad for the relative who did purchase it.
1,Feels cheap and nothing like the original.
1,Dull colors, lack of stretch, mediocre at best.
1,The ad says that it is new but it came in a little Ziploc bag with the lego mini figure OPENED package inside.  Was going to give this to my grandson in his Halloween bag.  This looks pretty cheesy.  Something someone opened and then didn't want.
1,The product instructions say talk and respond  to a bird. It's a man asking the same questions and the interrupting you when you try to respond. My son gets frustrated and annoyed with his "rudeness". The games are okay, the music is kind of lame.
1,Every Scooby foo fan knows you almost never solve a mystery without Velma. Product fail. You have to wait until Mystery Mansion to get her? Double product development fail unless your strategy is to coerce everyone into buying that product, which is may be smart but sinister. For service recovery they had better release small Velma and Daphne kits ASAP!
1,This is pretty complicated for a kid. And you'll need a whole lot of things that don't come in the kit to even make the stuff! You're better off just ordering the ingredients and following some Pinterest boards.
1,It does not come with directions. I feel bad for the kids that left the party early with their goody bag.
1,My 2 year old loves to tinker and explore but, unfortunately, he did not find much interest in this item.
1,Deceitful advertising. These aren't the thick plastic pieces- they are very thin. By the time your child is old enough to use them, they will be beyond this toy. They seem flimsy and may be useful in school buttheu are not for  average refrigerator magnets.
1,Fun game but this set is terrible quality! Cards are thin and some of ours were not printed on so we don't know which cards they are suppose to be and what we are missing. The directions have a ton of spelling errors too.
1,I can't believe anybody actually gave this a good review. If my daughter hadn't been crazy about it I would have returned it a while ago. The box is cute but when you open up the bags inside there's nothing to help keep it organized. What a mess.
1,Cheerson clearly has some quality control problems.  I purchased this CX10 on Amazon after a CX10A I purchased from another vendor arrived defective (awaiting replacement).  Well, this CX10 arrived, flew nicely for about 4 minutes, then went out of control with a failed motor.  It's on its way back to Amazon now.		About giving up on the CX10 series at this point and am going to try the Syma X12S (not the regular X12 which is not so great).  I have another Syma product and it has been very reliable.
1,Takes horrible pictures! Very disappointed
1,Not fun. Dumb questions. No one wants to play.
1,These ballons have an extremely foul odor, They smell like a rotting dead animal. Not sure what could possibly cause this but they are in the trash.
1,My costume came in opened bag. The Helmet was all bent out of shape. The pants are very long and are good for my 6 years old. The shirt is ok for my 3 years old. The Helmet would be nice if it would be not broken.
1,At first glance...What a disappointing piece of junk. Some pieces came bent, and others just completely malformed, not fitting together at all. Amazon did not have this in stock so I was forced to pay the gouge price of Babies R Us and this is completely not worth the $70+ it cost.	To give more detail...the latching pieces on the bottom of the hippo were bent, so they would not snap into the base. Some dangerous finagling with scissors through the bottom base got this together somehow. The "large ramp" was not formed correctly (seems to be missing plastic?!), and would not attach to the "small ramp," leaving a bizarre gap between the two rails. After struggling to get this together...the alligator did not work (did not trigger the music.) After trying to get it apart, it turns out that the screws holding the main arch to the end arch need to be LOOSE, and not snug. Loosening the screws magically got the alligator working.	I spent a long time trying to find this for a Christmas gift otherwise it would have gone straight back to BRU. I'm extremely disappointed, but it seems to be working and it being Dec 21, I'll keep it for my son.	I really had my hopes up that Amazon would get this back in stock before Christmas (They apparently had it for $31 in 2008) but to no avail. Then again even at $31 this is a risk since you very well may be sending it back.	On the plus side, I can see it being a fun toy.
1,I have two children who LOVE anything Mario or Sonic related.  My 9 yr old son decided he wanted a black Yoshi to go along with his officially licensed green one.  I ordered it for Valentine's Day knowing how excited he would be.		I received the item and was VERY disappointed.  The item is black but they used WHITE thread to sew it together.  The stitching along both arms and both legs were loose/stretched so that you could see the white threads everywhere.  In addition, there was a white "knot" of thread on the top of the head.  At first I thought it was stuffing coming through a hole.  Turns out it was just a bunch of threading.  Based on how rough they play with their other stuffed toys, this wouldn't have lasted a week.		Overall, I was incredibly unsatisfied and I returned the item.  If you are looking for something to just sit on a shelf for display, the item may work for you.  If you want it for actual use by a child, keep looking
1,My list of bad is rather long, so I'll be kind and limit it to four.		One - the instructions are horrific.  There is zero indication of where all the accessories are attached with the exception of the black bar connecting both halves.  Where do you put the hydrant, or the siren?  What attaches up to the fire truck? And you can't fit the X-ray scan and the patient in the same room, Doctor!		Two - how can a child be on both sides of the toy at once?  For instance, with the jail....you twist the action figure on top and the door BEHIND, out of sight, opens.  Who designed this? And just try getting the fire truck with accessories (I chose the water shots) through the overhead fire station door.  It's tricky!		Three - the fireman action figure cannot be seated in the fire truck when his uniform is on.  Interestingly, the policeman can be seated in the truck but I really had to smash him in.		Four - the sayings you see listed are the only sayings you will hear...outside of a welcome to Imaginext City (advertise much?).		Hints to Fisher-Price:	Develop a way to lock the front to the back for storage.	Put a carrying handle on it.	Make it so all the pieces can be stored and not fall out when moving the toy.	Better instructions for set up.
1,I wouldn't buy these again the stickers come off, and they only lasted a short while.
1,Cheap plastic toy that will not last very long. The inside plastic eventually ripped apart from the frame. Don't waste your money.
1,Orderd 2 of them and the both leak. i give up. Going to try to tape shut.
1,We received the tie that looks red in others' pictures - and it wasn't as cute as the darker tie (and it didn't exactly match the robe we had to go with it). But it was Halloween and we didn't have time to send it back...so buyer beware (or just buy it earlier so a return is possible if you get the red one!)...
1,Junk
1,It works. But it looks cheap and the lights are no very bright when you play with it. It works but I wouldn't buy it again.
1,Looks fun but sadly the handle broke on us within 2 minutes....first use....
1,WARNING:  THIS TRAIN DOES NOT FIT THROUGH BRIDGES OR MOST TUNNELS.  I had to buy a Salty because my son was so upset that his new train wouldn't go through all the fun stuff on the wooden train tracks.
1,The first thing you need to know about this puzzle is that this is a rectangular puzzle with a white boarder around the image.	By looking at the picture I had the impression the puzzle was an irregular shape, following the contour of the sandwich.	The second thing is... The pieces are large.	Which, to me personally, gave me the impression of doing a kid's puzzle.	I am not finished, but I would say the level of difficulty so far has been good. (By good I mean: not too easy)	The bottom part of the image is slightly fuzzy.	Overall, I'm enjoying this puzzle. But it will not be my favorite.	It's an interesting image.		UPDATE: I love puzzles, but this is close to impossible. I quit working on it. I never finished. You can put the surround together with some difficulty but by the time you reach the sandwich filling and bread it's almost impossible. NOT FUN AT ALL. Pretty image, but get another puzzle. I suggest the WASGIJ puzzles. They are interesting and extremely well engineered. (DO NOT BUY THIS ONE.)
1,Other than the flashy colors, this toy is a bummer! My son has virtually ignored this toy since day 1. Maybe he just doesn't get it. But I'd skip this one.
1,This thing was so much fun... the 2 times we got it to work. We can't figure out what happened but after only a couple uses it now only spits out a few bubbles occasionally
1,terrible waist of money
1,Pro: this is a great way to bulk up your collection if you are a casual player. Highly recommended.		Con #1: This is a random, bulk, collection. Card shops end up with ENORMOUS piles of cards that they sell off for dirt cheap. But the only way they make money is to spend very little time pulling these piles together - they just grab a pile and toss 'em in. Expect lots of duplicates, tons of junk, and not a lot of synergy. That's perfectly OK since you are getting a truckload of cards, but just make sure you know that ahead of time.		Con #2: Lots of online card shops offer this kind of deal. Just off the top of my head [..]offers their "Magic Instant Collection" of 1000 cards for only[..]. That's [..] cheaper. Shop around.
1,We never even opened the box. You could clearly see some of the paint was dried up without opening the package. My daughter was very disappointed. We sent it back for a refund.
1,I could not get this to work at all. The second you get a bubble on the paddle it breaks. It's useless and I don't recommend.
1,While the sleeping bag appears to be solid and my daughter absolutely adores it, the bag that it came in is a very poorly constructed. The straps came away from the top of the bag almost immediately after we took it out of the box. I am extremely disappointed and my daughter was devastated. We're now stuck spending an additional  $10 to get the bag fixed so my daughter can actually use it. If I were to do all over again, I certainly would consider a different option.
1,The Blade I received would only fly backwards, even with the elevation pushed all the way foward. If I gave it enough throttle to lift off it would start to go forward but then slide backwards and to the left rapidly. After 3 attemts to call the mfg.s customers service  over a period of a week, each time I was told it would be a 2 hour hold , I tried to email them and I was told by automated responce that it would be at least 3 to 5 days for a tech to contact me. Well at that rate I would go past the 30 day return window that Amazon has so I returned it. Cosidering all the positive ratings I've read I might give one another try someday. I ordered several of their coaxial models to give them a try so we'll see.
1,I got this for my six month old daughter because it looked like the perfect height for a sitting baby, and my daughter, like most  babies, loves to look in the mirror.  I should have read a better description of the  product  before ordering.		Below the mirror there is a panel of instrument-shaped buttons to press.  I wrongly assumed that the panel has several activities, or at least that each button would cause a different effect when pressed.  Turns out that regardless of which button the baby presses, the next song or sound plays.  Except for two little pop up babies,it has no interesting activities to keep baby occupied.		My daughters face lights up when I sit her in front of this toy, but within a few minutes, she's tired of it.  Besides for the toy being boring, the brightly flashing lights and obnoxious music are annoying (even for babies I think!). Come on Fisher Price, it's the 21st century.  There are great kids songs out there.  The least they could have done is added a few more songs, so they don't repeat as often.		This toy is the perfect height for a sitting baby, and there aren't too many of those.  It's a pity Fisher Price didn't put more thought into the design.  I don't expect too much from a toy.  If it keeps my daughter entertained for 15 minutes I consider it a success.  Unfortunately this toy failed.
1,Even though they look like they work, its very hard to get large items to stick..
1,So apparently cycling isn't safe and kids shouldn't ride a bike because they could end up in an ambulance? Where's the car crash kit? Way to put fear into children Playmobil.
1,Looks cheap, child was bored after an hour doesn't do much a small mirror, lion goes up and down, the black and white turn-able part bahhhhh..gum rings too small
1,My kids were so excited to try this product, as was I because we have an enormous container of broken crayon stubs I was hoping to repurpose (even though the kit does include 25 or so crayons in case you don't have your own). The instructions were easy to follow, the safety mechanisms worked well (though both of my kids keep trying to turn the knob the "wrong" direction--to speed it up--even though the instructions said this would break it), and the first crayon we made (ring shaped) worked moderately well. BUT that was it. I couldn't get it to make another one--it wouldn't heat enough a second time, and wouldn't melt the crayons well enough, and when I'd try pouring the freshly-melted wax it would get stuck on the old wax that was hardened on the front of the tray, which resulted in a solid layer that was 4 mm thick, so almost none of the liquid wax made it down into the mold. Although I could twist the knob back to "reheat," the light wouldn't turn on (maybe it sensed that it was already warm?), so we had to let it finish the entire 30-minute cycle before trying again, which was really annoying. Finally when it had finished I was able to remove the tray and studiously scrape off all the wax residue with a thumbnail (which was really messy and left little tiny scraps of crayon all over my fingers and table), and we tried again with that... and it still didn't melt it all the way. So on a THIRD try it finally melted, but with 3 crayons (the max allowed) in the top, it only filled up 1 of the 3 crayons in the mold below (and they're 3/4 size so there should have been plenty of wax for at least 2 of them).		This is all made more frustrating because each cycle takes 30 minutes and the SECOND you turn it on it locks, so you can't speed it up or attempt a reheat or anything else. You just. have. to. wait. So one bad cycle is 30 minutes down the drain, and two wasted attempts is a full hour. Ugh.  Even when this does work well (that one time!), it does take 30 minutes to run, and you have to keep an eye on the unit because the light turns off when it's ready to pour, but there's not a bell or anything to get your attention; you'll have to set your own timer on another device or risk forgetting.		I've now run this for 6 or 7 cycles (read: more than 3 hours of time invested) and have only gotten 2 usable crayons so far. This unit is seriously frustrating despite being a great concept.		UPDATE:	My daughter wanted to try this again, so we've put in a few more hours and gotten a few more crayons, and have figured out these tips:	* You MUST clean the heating pan every time (I recommend doing it over newspaper because it makes a mess); otherwise the thin, smooth layer of wax will prevent the next batch of crayon pieces from melting	* Even though it cautions not to use more than 3 (broken) crayons at a time, you'll have better luck filling the molds if you use 4 or 5. Though you _do_ still want to make sure they fit in a single layer	* When it's time to pour, you don't want to DUMP the wax and send it flying, but you DO want to pour it quite quickly (though the instructions say to pour slowly)--this minimizes the risk that the wax will harden too much before reaching the mold	* If the crayons aren't melted by the time it reaches the "pour" stage, just twist the knob to restart heating. Sometimes you'll have to do this 2, 3, or 4 times before it all melts. Unless you forgot to clean the pan, in which case there's no hope--you'll have to let it finish the full "heat and cool" cycle, then open it up, clean off the heating pan, and start over
1,Not worth experimenting with. Also very directional / parabolic signal distortion, and at times I've slipped them off and gotten better communication. Fun to play with at the cost, but don't get too serious about consistent better communication, drone/controller.
1,Returned the first one I got because it had obviously been opened before!  Sent it back for a new one, the ECM or the receiver is not the same one you would get from purchasing this from the redcat racing website!  I installed the correct voltage batteries, steering works, forward or reverse would not.  Thinking I had missed something, I took it to my hobby shop, three employees, all came to the conclusion that something was weird about the components, namely the ecm and the receiver.  They couldn't find the problem without tearing it down, I decided to return it and order direct form the Redcat Racing Website.  I forgot to take pictures of the ecm and receiver to match them to the one I got from Redcat, but I do know that they looked different!  These things are very cool and so much fun, but for some reason, the ones that amazon have are a little shady...
1,Omg. This is the worst. I bought this because I already own a few of the water wow books with the spiral binding, cover and reusable brush holder and I love them. This is a bunch of loose pages that DO NOT COMPARE. I. Can't stress this enough. These have one small area that does water react in the middle of a loose page that can not handle getting wet. The pages fall apart when they meet water which is the dumbest thing I have ever seen. This is supposed to be designed to use with the water brush that comes with! Don't buy this. Buy the separate books with spiral binding because they are great.
1,It's my own fault for not reading the product description more carefully, but seriously? Ribbons? What 1 year old sits still long enough for you to tie a ribbon around their chin? And what 1 year old keeps their hands off said ribbon? This lasted about 2 seconds on my child's head. I don't even think I got a good picture. When I told my husband I paid $10 for it, he let me know it was the worst $10 I'd ever spent. I agreed. Though if they switched from the ribbon to an elastic band, this would be a great product.
1,My niece of 1 1/2 years old flipped it forward twice while rocking within the first day.
1,The doll looks much better in picture then in reality. It is very cheaply made and the outfit is very cheap.	it looks like toysrus product and not Disney.  Still we wanted to be happy but:	One week later-	1. The hair looks like a bird nest. Comparing to our Disney store dolls this hair is like a bad perm.	2. The hands are a nightmare. They won't stay put and will go down. My daughter cries frustrated.	3. Any attempt to put on dresses of other dolls that come with any type of sleeve is a nightmare because of the joints and the	mobility of the wrists.		After reading other people's reviews about that Princess and me Disney store dolls  I asked around and my friend showed me their Snow White doll from that collection and OH MY GOSH! yes, I am going to look for Pocahontas in that collection till I find it. That design is unbelievable. Gorgeous and very strong feel to it. Not el chipo as this one.
1,For this much money, I'd expect the legs/arms to be wired.  The arms are sewn together - and the legs are unpositionable.  There's no way you can pose this elf.  He has one position.  That's it.
1,My son got this and has to put a cartridge in the pen to play with the right book.  The cartridges get LOST and you are out of luck.  This pen does not work all the time and it is pretty weak.  I also found out that this product is a KNOCK OFF of the Tag Pen by Leapfrog.  We picked Tag up recently to replace this one.  What a difference!
1,My daughter wanted a mooshka doll that sings when you push her hands together.  she was somewhat devastated when I gave her this for Christmas because the hands have Velcro but there is no singing.  I have returned it.  it's a cute doll, price was reasonable and it arrived in a timely manner and well packaged.  But, if you want the doll that plays a song, don't get this one.
1,I used this for my son's puzzles. I do not recommend! My son was able to pull out the pegs which is very dangerous!
1,My daughter got bored with it after 10 mins and never played with it again
1,Within minutes half the superheroes had a limb fall off.  I like how all the limbs move, but is has been six months now and wil very little play only Hawkeye and captain America remain whole- although their props no longer attach.
1,This was a total dud. I was searching for the Nerf brand shotgun & this was all I could find. The cat likes to chase Nerf darts and even he lost interest quickly. It jams easily & the darts don't travel very far.
1,My complaint is with the pricing - not yet given to my granddaughter so at this point in time I don't know how good or bad it is.  I purchased this CD from Finger Lakes Surplus (sold through AMAZON) for $49.00 - bought the computer too for $50.00!!!!  My stupidity to pay this much for software when the hardware was only $1.00 more!!!!  But since it appeared that this is a discontinued item (no longer on the Fisher Price website nor sold at Toys R Us), I thought I had no choice until a week later I see another seller  charging $25.00 - almost half the price - however, it had shipping of $4 and then another $6 to return the original CD to Amazon which means I would only save $14 in the end - was afraid I might encounter a problem (since the new seller had limited quantity) so I decided to keep the original CD but will be very wary of purchasing anything from this seller again!
1,I'd love to give this more than 2 stars but it did not function out of the box. The controller was not moving smoothly and felt like it was catching on some stuff. I was going to return it but it was a gift and I bought it more than 30 days ago so decided to try and fix it.		I Took the controller apart and found one of the wires attached to the lever was wrapped around a screw pole which was not allowing the lever to move freely. I fixed that issue and the controller worked well. The train would only move in reverse though.		So I took the engine apart. It looked like the the most likely culprit was a short on the motor leads. There was a piece of electrical tape in there but it was not covering all of the connections. I do want to note that there is a lot of manual soldering done on the circuit boards and on my example they are not done cleanly. I could resolder the entire board to clean it up but I don't think it's worth my time unless another issue crops up. Anyway, the heat shrink on the resistors was barely covering anything so I wrapped all of the motor leads with electrical tape. I then covered all of the metal on the motor with electrical tape, then reinstalled the engine shell.		The engine now works really well. It wouldn't even get up the incline before and now it easily climbs it. A sure sign of a short is the head light flickering. It should be constant on. If you have that issue pop the 2 screws on the bottom and wrap all of the motor leads with electrical tape. Should fix it right up.
1,Item came with one fish broken already. Doesn't play music as others say theirs do. Much more cheaply made than I remember, but it is enough to make the kids happy
1,We had high hopes for this toy, but it didn't live up to expectations.  I knew it wasn't meant to go on carpet but couldn't believe its proformance on hard wood as well.  It doesn't move well and isn't engaging at all.  Would not recommend to other mothers.
1,Child takes out puzzle pieces. Parent reassembles puzzles.  Repeat daily.		Foam tiles yes- puzzle piece foam tiles - No,
1,Very little to it
1,Only fits there tiny horses. I would not advise buying this to anyone unless you have their tiny horses which the fur comes off anyway.
1,I thought this would be bigger. It's not worth the price. Paper cut outs on a string. You can make one yourself.
1,I purchased this to look at coins, however, this is way too magnification. The seller will not allow you to return this item. Think carefully before purchasing it.
1,Awful...package was wrapped in what looked like Saran wrap.  The doll may have been used....tutu was cheaply made....look closely at the pictures because this is not your typical Barbie.  Would send back but too expensive to return and re-buy
1,Eh, cant say for my kids its so great. Not sure here is one thats any better tho
1,Locking device broke within a few days
1,My kids did not care much for this. This is one of those toys that serve no purpose.	Dont buy it.
1,It does not rotate like a ferris wheel because it just rocks back and forth when you turn it on.  So you have to use up batteries for it to keep any "perpetual motion".  Colors are not as bright in real life and is made of very cheap plastic.  Get what you pay for I guess.  Waste of money.
1,none
1,Great toy but missing pieces. :(. Just putting this together from Christmas and my son is so upset that it is missing pieces and can't be finished. Very disappointed.
1,These batteries are no where near the ones that came with Holy Stone Drone.  One of the batteries I only get 1 minute of flying time
1,cheap made and didn't balance correctly, no matter what we did to try to get it to work.  Funny little plastic "beans" were hard to handle and didn't seem to make much difference when you added them to the pot.  It might tump over after 1 bean or not tump over at all if they all were added.  Tried to play it once, doubt it ever leaves the box again unless the grand uses it for something else.
1,Would be really good- IF--- Metalbeard actually had ANY chance at all of standing up. Sadly- he doesn't, the peg leg is WAY too weak to hold the bulk of the upper portion of the kit. Guess it truly was designed by a kid who didn't follow the instructions. Also, how did the kid in the movie build this kit out ALL custom pieces- I am pretty sure 75% of the pieces in metal beard are one of a kind, unique pieces just for this model.
1,My 2 year old son really enjoys playing this piano and I enjoy that it comes with a songbook of simple songs I can play for him that he knows.  He is already trying to "play" the songs.		The downfall of this piano is the awful odor it is putting out.  It has been out of the box and open for 22 days and is still putting off a strong chemical smell.  (Smells like lacquer or paint or something.)  I don't like having my son around strong chemical smells.  You can smell it up to around 4 feet away as the air circulates.		The other lesser imperfections on this piano are that the strip of paper that identifies the keys fell off almost immediately.  It appears that it was only glued at either end of the strip.  Also the D key sounds off every time you play it.  I wouldn't return it just for these relatively minor issues.		I contacted customer service and the representative said that she'd never heard the smell complaint (I didn't even mention the lesser issues), although from reading the amazon reviews, there appears to be a number of people complaining about bad smells.  Perhaps it was a bad batch.  Customer service is planning to send a new piano... hopefully it will be better.  I would not recommend purchasing this piano if it is like the one we received.
1,very cheaply made
1,This was sent as a 7th birthday gift to grandson.  I was told that the battery life is extremely short and was overall unimpressive.  It turned out to be a disappointing gift and we are in the process of returning.
1,This item is of poor quality and should not be sold by a reputable company like Amazon.
1,Cute but way too small purchase  for my daughter birthday she was unhappy
1,Will not revolve.  Just slides on the table.  Should have returned it but too late now
1,Cheap
1,The t bent and broke and half...
1,Purchased this game for my son for Xmas.  The commercial and the actual packaging are very deceiving.  They do their best to purport that there are real laser beams, though it's just a bunch of red plastic clips and some blue string.  It seems pretty annoying to set up.  The word "lasers" is used on the front of the packaging and only in a small type font on the back do they state it's string.  We opened it, he was disappointed and we returned it.
1,its not a shinny silver its a dirty grey
1,Basically a $ store item. The picture shown is of a much higher quality item than I received.  But at least I didn't have to go hunting for them.  I ordered another set from another vendor ( looked different in picture) but both were the same. I purchased as a item for pretend play with my granddaughter And these will be OK but they are not worth what I paid.
1,too small
1,Everyone is better off buying everything in this set separately, it just includes at least 95% of everything that everyone else already has. Bandai, what in the Morphing Grid were you thinking?
1,After only three uses, the card holder started to come apart.  It was not roughly handled or played with, either.  I would rate it much higher if it stayed together better.
1,redundant game.  Each game is just trying to score as high as possible.
1,The product is cute and performs as described. However, the PRODUCT is NOT 11" rather the BOX is 11" the product itself is half the size and overpriced for a mini transformer!
1,as an eight yr old, I was thrilled to get 13 different minifigures for Christmas, but I haven't touched a one of them since I opened them nine months ago
1,Melissa and Doug products are usually first rate but these bubbles are useless.  Blow hard or soft, it doesn't matter, no bubbles will come out.  It can't be that hard to design a functional bubble wand, for Pete's sake.
1,I guess when I was little Transformers were a little easier to transform!!  My kids are having the HARDEST time with them!!  And they come apart sooo easily!  This particular one wouldn't stay together at all.  The kids kept losing the pieces...and got bored VERY fast with it.
1,Nice deck, a bit too small and flimsy
1,Ugh. I love Daniel Tiger. I think that maybe it is the best kid's show out there and a worthy successor to Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood, maybe the best children's show of all time. I understand what they were trying to do with this toy - provide a toy which allows for open ended and imaginative play. They wanted pieces that could double as different items, so that they were not boxing the kid in, but letting their imagination guide them. Great in theory.		In execution, this is a horrible toy in which none of the pieces fit securely together. When you take it out of the box, they seem as if they would, but they are held together by rubber bands and cardboard and such. That has to be removed to play, and then nothing fits securely anymore. You'd think it would snap together, but no.		And then there's the abundance of little toys, aka choking hazards. Well, hazardous if you don't lose them first, which is very likely you will since they are so small. Also I'm not sure what they are supposed to be really. Some are a bit too amorphous that even the best imagination won't be able to do anything with them. I've taken to just throwing these little parts out (whenever I actually find them, usually under the couch). The tree is cute, and I like that you get Katrina, Daniel and O. But for the money, it would have been better (and less frustrating) to purchase the friends action figures and then another set like the trolley or Daniel's house.		For what it is worth, my daughter loves the tree and the figurines. She doesn't play with the little toy pieces, except for the umbrella. She thinks that is cute.
1,I was so excited when I found this puzzle for my 18 month old daughter who is very interested in the alphabet and can already identify several letters. The chunky pieces are a good size for little fingers to grasp. The wood construction and brightly colored stains (not paint) are lovely. However, we are so disappointed with the puzzle in practice. The letters are shaped too abstractly for a child just learning the alphabet. Some letters are so similar that it's confusing - see my photo of the C and the G. Even worse, some similarly-shaped letters have been given the same color!  See my photos of the V and Y, as well as the K and X. My daughter keeps trying to put the curvy salmon colored X into the place for the curvy salmon colored K. We don't want her to get frustrated with letters, so we will be putting this puzzle away until she's older and ordering one with more distinct letters for now.
1,This tent is so cute...but so cheaply made! The fabric and the stitching are beyond poor. The 'lip' under the door ripped the second time my 4 year old went inside because he simply tripped over it and caused it to tug. I ended up being able to get it replaced and didn't the same thing happen to the second one within 15 minutes of use. One of the poles also began to poke through the top. I bought this for my 2 year old daughter and though she and my 4 year old son enjoy it, I have serious doubts that it will last longer than a week. I read previous reveiws but thought the problems were rectified because the box said something like "improved design" but apparently it still has the same problems. My son has two other pop up tents that cost roughly half the price and neither has a single flaw in three years of use. I think this tent is only appropriate for a really calm, careful child...if such a child exists. Invest in something else.		One week later...yup, completely destroyed!--I am utterly ashamed of Disney for putting their name on such a piece of garbage!
1,Very disappointed. I did some research about Pokemon cards and realized these were all fakes. Too cheap to be true, I guess. I bought some legitimate ones from Toyrus and compared to see the truth. Of course a few were obvious because the HP was like 9000. I doubt my son who is 6 would have cared, but after bringing the fakes to school, a few boys started to tease him about his "fake" cards. That inspired me to do some research. Several sites and YouTube videos out there to help you out.
1,We received the elephant lovie for Christmas.  I was pleased with it at first as my five month old son likes to rub his face or chew on a blanket to fall asleep for naps.  I thought this was safer than a blanket since it was smaller.  The lovie has an elephant tail on the end which my son particularly likes to chew on. Today for his morning nap, I got a bad feeling that I needed to check the blanket.  Lo and behold, the elephant tail was hanging by literally one thread!  We have only been using this lovie for two weeks now so needless to say I was shocked.  My son EASILY could've choked on this!  All it took was one simple tug and I ripped it off.  Upon closer inspection, I noticed that the tail and the elephant body had been very poorly sewn on with large gaps in the threading.  While it is cute, it is not safe for babies!
1,Its a fake
1,Glo Doddle is a lot of fun, but it breaks very very quickly with regular play. The erase design must have defective. We bough glo doodle on Wednesday morning, it was broken by Friday morning. It was not handled roughly. The outside was not broken. But the inner part that allows it to erase cracked and then the crack spread quickly. It is not fun enough to have it for only 2 days. Hopefully they can fix the problem.
1,They are fun but didn't even last a year they broke mins apart from each other.
1,I purchased these as xmas gifts for my office mates. When brand new batteries were put in, the light actually emitted was extremely small and dim. very disappointing.
1,Tiny beware this is tiny. It isn't beanie baby size it is smaller.
1,I wouldn't recommend it if you wanted to have good replicas of the animals. The workmanship on these pieces leaves a lot to be desired but guess its a good deal for the price.
1,Really hard to get the "hair" where you want it, and my kid was not very interested in it.
1,The Crayoloa Dry Erase Light Up Board seemed like a big hit when I told my 8 year old son about it.  As soon as the item came he was quick to open the package and was eager for me to help him set it up. Unfortunately that is when the excitement faded.  As we put the board together it turned out to be very cheaply made with construction that does not look like it will hold up. Once assembled the final result is a flimsy looking product that was difficult to use.  The pictures do look cool once lit up but honestly it was not enough to hold my son's attention for more than 15 minutes.  Add to this the difficult clean up and my my son did not want to play with the light up board again. This could have been a great product but its poor execution made this below average.
1,This product is straight to landfill junk!  The wood base is not even flat, the pegs are cheap, cheap plastic!  Worthless!
1,Terrible! Worked one time and now it just jams over and over. Pieces of the foam bullets get stuck in the gear and stops the gear from turning therefore doesn't fire. Really disappointing for a Nerf product.
1,Not for a toddler. Words too small and puzzle pieces too small and easily broken.
1,Cheaply made.did not have screw for battery compartment and batteries fell out and it kept tipping over. I returned it
1,Hasbro really scaled down the quality and components in this newest version of the game.	-No card box. (Last version dropped this already.)	-No card easel. You use the spaces in the black plastic box liner instead.	-No electronic buzzer, rubber "squeaker" instead.		Get one of the older versions. I've still seen the last 2010 edition in stores and it's still fairly updated with words.		Or just opt for the electronic version called Taboo Buzz'd and avoid the game pieces altogether with an incorporated timer, buzer, many more phrases, and automatic scoring. It's like Electronic Catchprase but more fun!
1,Cheap, flimsy and did not work at all.
1,A rather random race game with mild interaction, it relies on its theme to much and it just doesn't feel like a fun experience.  Everyone has the same options with their cards they just come out at different times.  There is a lot that is out of your control during the game and you can finish last over the finish line but win the game by having more money, which seems rather pointless.
1,This product itself had great reviews so I got it for you 2 year old for Christmas. We finally opened it today. I'm not sure if this issue is with the product itself or if I received a faulty one. The one we received didn't erase all the way. We wrote on it and had to swipe the eraser back and fourth over 10 times for it to almost erase the drawing. My child won't have the patience to do this. We have a very cheap drawing board like this that erases fine so it's a disappointment that this more expensive one doesn't work properly.
1,This is not for everyone. It's very expensive to have it destroyed in one flight. Very fragile and very difficult to get replacement parts.	I do not recommend at all. Looks like fun, but not worth the money.
1,This Bart is exactly the same edition that comes with Simpsons Lego Minifigures series 1 and the same slingshot as Bartman (series 2). (Homer's Dimensions release comes with a different accessory even if also the same minifigure.) Lego totally blew it to release this without obtaining voice license (so Bart is totally mute during the game). The soap box derby racer is adorably cute as a Lego collectible, but alas, the in-game abilities of figure and racer are not impressive. We're very disappointed.
1,Cute idea but my kids were just not interested in the table just the blocks
1,If pieces get lost (as they likely will), the manufacturer, Melissa & Doug, does not offer replacement pieces.  When I inquired about replacement pieces, they responded, "Our puzzles and toys are all cut by hand, and when the items are hand cut, the dimensions of each piece can vary slightly from puzzle to puzzle, and toy to toy. If we were to send you the missing pieces, they more than likely wouldn't fit into your puzzle, since they weren't originally cut for your puzzle. For that reason, we don't keep any extra pieces in our inventory." Although I generally like Melissa & Doug products, I would be more inclined to recommend it if I knew I could replace lost pieces.
1,We got this as a gift and got the kids excited at first.  Same as Jenga, whoever put the last piece before the tower falls loses.  The top of the tower where you attach the pieces are held magnetically on top.  Pieces are falling even just in the beginning of the game.  The game literature instruction tells you that all you have to do is to place again the pieces that fall prematurely.  But that does not happen once or twice in the game; it happens all the time, very frustrating.  There are 36 pieces to hang, even if you put all of them, the magnet is too strong that the tower will not fall.  So, what's the point?  This toy just does not work.  Why this game passes production phase puzzled me.		Everybody knows Jenga, a classic, simple and exciting game that uses rectangular blocks of wood or plastic.  Jenga is a great game, but this game that carries its name is a black sheep in the family.
1,Mine was delivered and it was broken in it's package
1,They didn't just make a pink one. They also dumbed it down the special girl's edition is packaged in a keepsake storage box with removable tray and non-glass mirrored insert the pink gameboard and dice with unique properties to buy such as spas and jewelry stores, boutiques and malls instead of houses and hotels	Instant Message and Text Message cards instead of Chance and Community Chest. It's not the experience I encourage my girl's to have with what was once a pretty good game!
1,It falls frequently due fact that the base is not width enough. So this issue is kind of frustrating for the kid and could trigger not playing enough with it or leave it.	The design and material is good though.  The fact of puzzle the pieces is great but when you try it falls due to the base size.
1,I guess you get what you pay for, but it arrived already out of batteries - and if you're like me, you don't have those teeny round battery thingies just HANGING around - so my kid was disappointed...
1,Bought it for my daughter for Christmas.  Doesn't work.  All it does it light up.
1,Worked for the minute it was on before going in the water. As soon as it touched the water it shorted out and has never worked again. I acutally went and got the packaging out of the trash to make sure it really was supposed to be a bath toy... Total junk don't bother
1,My 8 yr old son has been waiting for new Godzilla toys forever. He is an avid collector. For his 9th birthday he asked for any Godzilla 2014 I can get my hands on.  I was one of the 1st to get it. I was elated. Well it was gone, once my husband opened the package and the right leg popped off. Upsetting. The leg actually keeps popping off. Also the way his mouth is constructed is weird when the "atomic fire " comes out Godzilla mouth opens extremely wide, he looks like he is vomiting. The product was definitely a rushed job, not worth $35, more like $20. My 3 yr old son loves this Godzilla but it will not last in his hands, due to poor construction.
1,this broke in 5 min. DONT BUY
1,So bad.
1,Poor quality, does not go fast...in fact it is always slow.  A piece of junk!
1,AWFUL quality items!!
1,Puzzle pieces don't fit very well.  And under A is a picure of an airplane but then under J is a picture of a Jet.  Kind of confusing for toddlers learning words and the alphabet.
1,waaaayyy too small.. even for a travel toy.  The balls get stuck inside.. you have to shake it to release them.  Sitting in the yard sale pile!
1,The first few days the train ran like a champ, with some handling the wheels with the electric motor seem to bend easy and seems to force itself to run.		Was upset at low quality build.
1,Very cute stuffed animal, and perfect for our needs with it. However, I was very disappointed that the Velcro broke off immediately after we received this product. I'll do my best to repair it, but I'm no seamstress so I don't know if I'll be able to fix it properly or not.		Update...after only one week of use (after which it was washed because it was used in a school setting), there was a large hole that had to be sewn up.		Very poor quality. Incredibly upset with this purchase.
1,You have to buy all the characters separately...if you can find them. I've found one in the clearance bin at wallyworld for just a couple bucks. I've seen the system at steep discounts in stores as well, but I think they pretty much don't sell it anymore. My son likes it, but it's a little hard for him and he gets discouraged quickly. It's hard for me to play too. I like that the controller is wireless, but it had to be right in front of the console, only a few feet away or it does not work. My kids like to point the controller at the tv instead and so it doesn't work. I don't have a way to put the console right in front of the tv, only to the side so this becomes an issue as well. It's cute for my transformer loving son but not really worth a whole lot.
1,I will be returning this product ASAP! This is the biggest peice of crap I have ever purchased. It doesn't stay up with even one plastic cup inside. For something that says that it has extra heavy duty sticking cups it sure doesn't! I was so upset because I've been looking for something to put my	Sons bath toys in for such a long time!
1,Well, I'm sorry to report that this set arrived with some broken pieces.  I can't figure out how to contact the company to have them replaced.  Anyway, the set is not as clean as I'd like to see.  The pieces have mold seams, which is not unexpected but it's not so great for a chess set that it partially for display.  It's not a bad looking set but it feels kinda cheap.
1,Difficult to assemble. Kids (two 4 year old girls and a 2 year old girl) just weren't really into it. Just a lot of little plastic. If you have a polly pocket lover, this may be a good buy.
1,Not much to this toy, rather boring for my imaginative 4 year old.
1,I've purchased alot of Diamond Select/Art Asylum Trek toys and this is mostly plastic junk. First off the tiny cylindrical scanner in the bottom compartment had a broken on/off switch and since other than the battery compartment it's machine sealed so I can't even take it appart to fix it. The two drawers break off when you try to open them and the dials inside are completely non-functional. You literally have to tear the compartment covers off to open them thus getting at the main switch to turn it off of try me mode. Once you've finally found that switch since no instructions came with this you can flip back open the top with the stationery screen and buttons. The screen lights up but it's not very detailed. The center button makes a scannig noise while the left apparently does nothing. Pressing the right button you'll hear Nimoys voice as Spock say several phrases which is probably the only authentic aspect of this. It does have a black strap as well if you were to wear it as prop. I've requested a replacement mini cylindrical scanner but so far the company and amazon have not responded.
1,The ball smelled horrible. We had to inflate it outside and leave it there for a few days to air out.  I don't know what chemicals they use to produce this bouncy ball but we set it on our dining room chair and when I went to get it, it had stuck to the back of the chair. It pulled off the paint from the chair. This was a high end chair that was in perfect condition. Not sure I want to keep my hands on something that is loaded with chemicals that leach out.
1,Leg was broken when package was opened!
1,were horrible and reported for bad quality
1,Item was great.
1,The red buckle was not sewn. I did read some reviews stating the same issues. I just figured maybe it was a bad batch or one off situation. But I also received a defective toy. For the price, the quality control process is being missed and should be better. Disappointed that the red strap is broken and all the buckles are lose and sag. They overlap each other. They are not tight like in the picture
1,They were smaller then expected and didn't hold helium very long at all.
1,Children didn't care for the horn
1,It may have been the assortment of toys that came in the bucket I received but I was not too impressed. Came with a small flashlight that does not work. There was a small ghost with the words BOO on it that were half peeled off. Also had packaging issues with it being shipped in too small of a box, as a result the pumpkin was deformed and the black face was peeling off. I am sure had I taken the $10.99 I paid and went to the dollar store I would have been better off. :(
1,The stickers were stuck to the paper. Mostly all the stickers didn't end up as stickers.
1,Didnt work.
1,This toy only pops if rolled on carpet, and with exerted force while pushing down and walking.  My daughter is not able to do  this even at 20 months...  When she uses this toy, she walks with it but the wheels don't roll, they just glide across the floor and therefore no popping.  This is an incredible disappointment on a classic toy that was ruined in the new design.  We are going to be returning this.  Today.
1,choices are not very creative and very repetitive
1,Nothing to it.  Needs a better description.  All parts were lost with in 10 minutes.
1,These are my sons favorite toys, at the moment. He is 4 years old and I was happy because you can find great offers on the different mashers. He has almost all of them but unfortunately they break it is a recurrent problem and I am afraid the reason why these toys are affordable and almost always on sale. :( sad because otherwise the toys are great for imagination and motor skills development.
1,It just didn't really work
1,I purchased this for my 2 1/2 year old grandson for Christmas. Within an hour, the frame tubing were either bent or busted. My grandson is active but this was ridiculous! I was so disappointed. Now it's held together (barely) with duct tape. This should not be! I believe they should have an extra set or two of tubing with it...it's cheap enough! Not too happy with this item, although my grandson loves it!
1,I bought this for my daughter when she was 6m old.	The assembly was easy, although the back purple ear piece came off a lot...		Loading the balls into the tray was not hard, the one VERY frustrating thing about this toy is that the ball retrieval area at the bottom is TOO SMALL!!  I get that maybe the toy designer was thinking a child might be taking the balls out, maybe?  Let me tell you a 6m+ old is not taking them out to reload - you are and the area is too small and your hand doesn't fit.  I wanted to be able to grab a few to load into the top at the same time since I have a baby sitting there waiting to be entertained.  Instead I have to nearly take them out one by one, so annoying.		I would not buy this again - too bad I lost my receipt , this would have gone back to the store.
1,Didn't last long. It cracked and the beads were spilt out.
1,i have not deboxed the doll but want to confirm what Frosted Butts wrote in a review - this set contains the wrong Cleo. She appears to be Scaris Cleo instead of 13 Wishes Oasis Cleo.		[...]
1,Oh man, I really wanted to like these. I mean, I really did. I'm not a fussy person....These were pretty poor quality. They don't stick in place at all. I didn't expect much because of the price, but these fell flat at our house. Nobody likes them.
1,Way small.  I studied and studied in hopes of getting the right size for snackin Sara Baby Alive.  But these look way too small.  Even the diaper that she came with wasn't easy for 5 years olds to get on.  I had to help them.  Hoping to find something better later.
1,This was for my adult daughter, who wanted something to do as she would be alone on Christmas. She was totally disappointed, and returned it. She said it was flimsy, and not as described, and didn't have all the parts listed.
1,It's really hard to rate a series 1 bag when you receive a series 4 bag instead
1,difficult to use set up long and frustrating
1,This thing is garbage. It never works right and my kid has not touched it since Xmas day.
1,hated these cars broke in just couple of days poorly designed/made
1,THIS COMPANY SENDS A KNOCK OFF OF THE REAL AIR SWIMMERS by Animal Planet! My father just sent us one of these and it's a knock off. The real Air Swimmers has a green box and the Animal Planet logo on it. This one is a knock off by some company named Yu Yuan. This one doesn't even look like the real shark, it's got a cute pink tongue, not the sharp looking teeth and gums you see in the photos. It's cheap and useless, we're waiting to hear back from Amazon and hopefully get a refund.
1,Arrived not working.  We got it out of the box and put the batteries in, then turned the thing on and there was nothing but a white screen. We tried the troubleshooting suggestion...Nope! My poor daughter had camped out by the window all day, waiting for the truck to come deliver this piece of junk that she used her own Amazon card for. She was heartbroken. Her first Amazon experience did not go well - and it really made me angry to see that. Grrrrrrrr.....junk!
1,I don't know why they made this boy's version of the klip klop horses toy not as fun as the girl's stable.  My son loved the display at the store and I thought the klip klop horses were really neat, however, I felt some kind of gender pressure to buy the knight version over the princess version just because he's a boy.  Then we decided to just get the princess stable anyway because who cares if it's pink when he enjoys playing with it.  The stable has more ramps, more detail, plus lights and sounds which he loves.  It really makes this knight one look boring.  I wish companies would consider boys like to have fun too!  I definitely recommend checking out the stable over this toy.
1,I wanted a fun Olaf toy to go with my daughter's Elsa and Anna barbie dolls but he is too big and his head isn't attachable it's always off or just barely resting there which my daughter doesn't like.
1,Only good with no wind sucks with any wind
1,We bought this set while potty training our daughter thinking her doll could learn as she did. However this set completely fell short of all expectations.		The bottle is flimsy plastic that leaks when filled with water and the top does not fit well making it a chore to screw on or off.		The potty is not the right size for any toy I know. Too big for barbies but too small for bigger baby dolls and the bowl of the toilet does not extend far enough from the back to allow a doll to sit on it. Any doll we tried flopped forwards and fell off.		My daughter's initial squeals of delight quickly turned into whines of frustration when she tried to play with this. Any toy that has that effect gets the lowest rating possible.
1,Absolutely loved this for my 5 and almost 3 year old until I heard my son say oh no! The circular magnet had bounced off the granite. I'm a previous science teacher and know how dangerous magnets can be. This shouldn't have happened.
1,We bought this for our 2 year old granddaughter for when she visits us, which is usually once a week.  The phone stopped working after about 1/2 dozen times using it.  The phone just flashes red in crazy patterns and plays the same thing over and over.  Very disappointing.  This is the second Vtech product that has stopped working fairly quickly.  We won't buy Vtech anymore.
1,Also much smaller then the picture preceived for the money. the box of several kreo figures came late and one of the small figure boxes had been opened up with the contents spilled all over inside the box. I hope none of the pieces are missing as the gift went to an under priveleged child. You could tell the box had been trowen around a lot. I wouldn't order them again. There not worth the money charged
1,well ours arrived, we were so excited!!! and then he didn't work.... wanted a replacement but i guess that isn't an option has to be a refund... :-( very large let down
1,Just how different batteries are for Fisher Price 6 Volts are they? This wasn't compatible with one the grand kids power wheels
1,My son immediately opened it and started playing with it.  It was clumsy moving left to right and seemed rather loud for a small toy.  You need other Beyblades for this one to attack or repel, it must do it based upon magnets within itself and other Beyblades (??).  So the attack and repel modes didn't work without a second unit. It's basically just a spinning top. He played with it a few days and then the batteries were dead and he didn't ask for new ones so I know this toy was a bust. But later my husband looked at it and he tested the batteries as good, so it just quit working. And for the price? Wow, that's expensive.
1,I wouldn't even give it 1 star if that were possible. Everything is TINY! It might be good for 12 year olds but it's rated for 8 year olds! No way! It was extremely difficult to follow the directions and required other tools than those mentioned. You'd also need about 8 hands to complete the projects!
1,Cute. Broken easily & didn't entertain as I thought
1,This toy only comes with 1 disc - which is clearly stated in the description.  The problem is, the watch doesn't do anything else except trigger its discs.  When no disc is in, it simply does nothing.  It makes it hard to play imagination when nothing happens except nothing or "HUMONGOUSAUR".  It is only a teaser for how much fun this toy could be.  This toy was given to my son.  I wish the buyer had done some research to find that the discs are discontinued.  I am now in a bidding war on Ebay to buy the few discs that are left for sale in this world.  If I win, my kid will play with it for more than 1 minute but I spend $20-$30, if I lose, it sits in a bin in the toy room and maybe some play-date kid will play with it for 1 minute.  Don't buy - just frustrating!
1,Typically have nothing but positive things to say about hot wheel products but this was a disappointment! I got this for my 5 year old for Christmas and he was not impressed. The launcher in the front of the truck is difficult to figure out and my son quickly lost interest.
1,It is small..... Really small... And the decorations are scratched and in poor shape.....
1,I agree with what others have said, the dinosaurs are not painted nearly as nicely as the photo.  Most are one solid color with a tiny spray of another color.  Not at all realistic.
1,They broke so easily while trying to set up :(
1,I was very excited to find these and my kids were extremely happy, however they are made with cheap material. Some pieces broke within minutes of opening the packaging. I don't think they will last very long.
1,Kept about 15 minutes before returning. The poles seem really cheap and the tip that goes in fish mouth can pop off too easy.
1,Really poor quality. Does not look like rick. Looks like Benedict Cumberbatch playing a lumbersexual
1,not happy At all didn't work at all as a grandpa you don't like giving you grandkids something and not work when all the other kids does NOT COOL
1,I had high hopes for this blanket craft kit. The ties were too short. It was extremely frustrating to even tie a couple knots, even for an adult. We gave up. Really bummed.
1,This is a huge let down to me. It's not nearly as big as the picture led me to believe, which is fine. I would be happy enough with the size...except as everyone before has stated, it's cheaply made. The knob that is used to open and lower the gate is crooked, so bad so that it touches on one side while being WAY out on the other. The castle gate doesn't sit even close to flush, I've seen two cracks in the flimsy wood so far. I'm so heart broken. When I told my kids about the castle coming in, they were so excited. They were here when it arrived, ripped the box open all excitedly, and were just like "that's it?" This was supposed to be their "big toy" for a week long sca event coming up. No electronics, no modern toys, all wooden toys and poppets and such. I'm scared to even bring it. I don't know if it will make it there, if it does I know it will be ruined in days, even if we keep it in the tent when not in use. I can't believe I wasted my money on this. I should've just spent the extra and got the large building block castle set, it was $50 more, but I truly thought this would be more fun for them, and normally I utterly ADORE Melissa & Doug. I know I seem like I'm being a bit melodramatic, but seriously for a WEEK my kids go without modern toys, so for the one big cool toy to be such a failure, it's pretty sad.		I'm giving it 2 stars because my kids didn't hate it, despite how I feel. They just weren't as excited when they opened and saw how cruddy it was. They'll play with it, but I can see it was a waste of money and won't make it through one event.		*EDIT* It did not make it 1 day at 1 event!! IT BROKE BEFORE WE EVEN MADE IT THERE!! Sitting in the car with nothing but pillows and blankets it FELL APART!! The SELLER IS A JOKE. A Highjacker selling someone else's stolen products! They would do NOTHING to help me!!
1,waste money
1,I bought this for the kids after seeing so many great reviews on Amazon. I can't understand how so many people are having so much fun with this game. The first time through our kids got bored and didn't even want to finish. The premise is too simple and not very engaging. Further the fart machine tones as the button is pressed  make it obvious as to when to expect the next fart leaving very little anticipation. We all love farts in this family but did not love the game at all.
1,Cute tattoos but they come off in a few hours
1,Product does not work well it is cheaply made and doesn't float like it says it will.
1,I ordered 2 of these trolls for my kid, and I already knew they were the same one just by feeling the package.	Really really disappointing for her to have to open an identical toy.	The sellers should make sure it's not the same toy, it's not that difficult.
1,The punching bag doesn't hold air and the base is not sand like other punching bags.  You fill it with water to anchor the base of the bag.  If the top part can't hold air I'll certain the base won't hold water for long.  I've emptied it and am trying to dry it out, then we'll evaluate how to maybe get sand into the base instead of water.
1,It didn't work. Total waste of money!
1,Such a little bit of cake for the price of several store-bought decorated ones- just so a kid can make a mess! Hasbro holds all Moms. Grandmas, and Aunts hostage with this product. The kid gets an Easy Bake Oven as a gift and then wants to try baking. $10.00 to $20.00 for cake mixes that don't taste very good and have about 10 CENTS worth of flour in them....We should all rebel and just say NO- but then there are the yearly commercials that are so convincing. Better to teach little Janie how to bake for real and do the ovening yourself.
1,its very small. made of cheap card board. and comes flat, you have to put it together. But there is no instructions on HOW  to put it together. I wouldn't give it to a child it would brake within 10 mins.
1,Terrible RC car. Went through a spare battery, charger and still didn't fix this truck. The truck itself would not accelerate when you pull the trigger back all the way.		This is the 3rd on of these I've purchased and all 3 have had problems
1,It's ok if it's not on. But once I tuned it on the train kept falling off. I was really sad
1,All  the cards were very low value and the Full Art card was a trainer card - can't even trade it. A complete waste of money and a total disappointment to my son.
1,Very disappointed... Cheaply made like something from the dollar tree... over half of the rhinestones had fallen off when I received it.
1,Only one use. Rollers started falling apart. Makes more of a froth than paint.
1,Complete junk. Worked for about 4 hours however if you are giving to a younger child they will likely want to take it on/off as it if flashy and fun. Unfortunately the way it works is by a magnet that creates the connection. Heaven forbid your child pull generally on the bracelet versus the exact point of the join as this will simply result in the wires pulling straight out and unless you have a soldering iron, wire and a very steady hand that is good with very small wires this will be going in the trash. If you are OK with spending $1 an hour on a child's partial entertainment so be it, if not buy a real bracelet that may last.
1,The bear itself is okay its just that I envisioned it to a little bit bigger like some of the other animals I have gotten were.
1,Pretty disappointed in the condition the game came in. Currently trying to straighten out the face part so my anxious 4 year old can play.
1,Very  unsteady! Not Happy! OH well.
1,Don't bother.	Ignore all these 4 & 5 star reviews, they're obviously written by the manufacturers.	Sea Monkeys didn't work in the 70s and they don't work now.	I bought these for my son, we used purified water, had it at exactly the right temp, put them out of direct sunlight, followed the directions exactly.	What we got was about 3 living shrimp which died the same day and then nothing else. Very disappointing for my kids.	Just buy a goldfish, it's a lot easier.
1,Music not loud enough
1,They work okay but are cheap and the talk button is on the front instead of on the side, which is really dumb.
1,It is ok if you like HARD puzzles, this one has small pieces and many are the same, so you don't know until you try and fit another piece.  It will take me forever, I thought to just pack it up and stick in the closet, but I kept at it and found where I had put in the wrong piece...tough puzzle.
1,I bought this for the shield, as finding swords that are good quality for kids is rather easy. The "handle" on the back of the shield broke as I was taking it out of the box/packaging. Horribly constructed. The handle is a flimsy piece of plastic/styrofoam that is barely attached to the shield itself. An actual handle would be better. If you are looking for a good daggar sword, this is nice, but if you're after the shield, look elsewhere.
1,Overpriced. It's very small. May daughter could care lessabout it. The batteries last forever though.
1,Although it serves the purpose of a toy for a baby, isn't half the reason to have the baby play with the xylophone? Xylophone is completely off key. So, does this toy differ from any other toy in which you need to press or pound the balls? NO. This toy is absolutely an overpriced toy. I would return it, but I received it as a present from a very close friend. Please buy something else. It only looks cute and doesn't meet the expectations.
1,Not much to it. You could do better on you tube
1,Good thing we got two one wouldn't charge brand new but charges off of other control
1,Its a really slim battery for a 3s but wide it is a nice snug fit inside my slash 4x4 battery tray already cut that banana plug and put traxxas comes with real nice and thick 10g wire only 4 stars because i have not ran it yet but it already reads 2 per cell that kinda sucks as my other batteries read 0 when new but i will test it out this week and do an update		Update 5/25/16	Ok so after running this pack less than 5 times i have some very very surprised opinion and new review of this battery idk why and how everything went downhill so fast my other softcase packs feel like solid like it doesnt move up in down like if the cells were cracked or broken inside this one is straight junk after 2nd use the shrink wrap had already ripped apart and exposed the cells i got other ones that gone thru 10 times worse and still are better condition and last but not least is the warranty changing the plug damages the battery how does it so when they solder the original battery plug they damaged the battery already then will never be a cheapa** again
1,This is a great toy that is very popular in my house. However, the colored triangles broke off during the first use.
1,Work well. Only problem I've had is that my unit  loses signal randomly sometimes and the 8 AA's on it go pretty quickly. Otherwise it is great.
1,Not all its cracked up to be.
1,HORRIBLE JUNK! made of beads, I could make it for 15 cents ! Sending it back. Learned my lesson, NEVER BUY ANYTHING ON AMAZON FROM CHINA !!!!!
1,My daughter loved this! But it broke after one use! Microphone stopped working, but the stand still works. Disappointed.
1,The toy works better on the door than on the floor.  On the door its more challenging.  On the floor, its certainly not challenging, unless you're on the other side of a large room.  The quality is not great.  I was expecting much higher quality for the forty dollar current price.  Its certainly not worth it in the last.  Even at ten bucks, it would be expensive.  Do a search for indoor basketball hoop, and youll find a lot of much more affordable options.
1,some of the figurines fell apart... but my kid still liked it after some super glue.
1,Very small
1,This was just a cut out butterfly that had no properties to make it fly. A total rip off.
1,Fragile but fun.
1,Not worth the price.  Very cheaply made.  My daughter loves Rapunzel but she was not pleased with this.  Has not played with it once.
1,I am very disappointed in this product. I have purchased the 50 balloon kit for my daughter's 6th Birthday party. I was very excited to do so since buying 50 would have been more expensive.	Well, so I thought. Only under more careful inspection did I realize that I was able to only inflate 27 of 11" latex balloons. However, I didn't plan on buying extra balloon, so I figured I just use the 9" balloons included in the kit. There is where the problems started. One third of the balloons were faulty. They had holes in them or just plain burst while I inflated them (and I didn't over inflate them). Furthermore, it took me over an hour and a half to inflate the balloons, cut the ribbon and attached to the balloons. Then to my horror, as I woke up the morning of the party all balloons where on the floor. They didn't even last over night. I inflated them around 10pm and when I woke up at 7am they were all down. What a scam.	If I only purchased the balloons at the party store (89cents for an 11" balloon), I would have not only saved money but also been able to decorate the party as indented.
1,The paint came off, bleeding red and blue, when I wiped it with a little water before giving it to my baby. I tried wiping down several times in case the excess paint just needed to wear off a bit, but it just didn't stop. I had to return because everything goes in her mouth and it would have been red and blue drool all over! I assume it's safe paint but not good how easily it comes off and it was hard to get it out of the cloth I used to wipe off the toy!
1,The tiem was old and super tiny the paint of the figures was old and vanish from the edges they are quite an awful product.  The bag were they come it was home made and pretty old as if has been traveling back and forth, super disapointed since i planed to use them for my kids farm theme party. DO NOT BUY
1,Bad quality, falling apart. Very gentle and not kid resistant.
1,Not at all what we thought it was. This item was returned the same exact day that it was delivered.
1,Walk away.  Safe yourself and get regular window markers.  These are so wanky that there isn't any discernable color, just a haze.		VERY DISAPPOINTED
1,We purchased this for my daughter. It was from Billy & Sons but fulfilled by Amazon. The item arrived in an outer shipping box that wasn't even taped shut. The interior product box was also opened. It was pretty obvious that it was a return.		We didn't notice too much wrong with it other than a spot where it appeared the seam was coming loose in the window. We knew we wouldn't receive a replacement by my daughters birthday so we kept it. Within 2 days there were places where it had ripped through and the "door" was ripped at a seam.		Definitely not a durable product and for some reason we were sent an item that was a return and Amazon didn't even take the time to inspect it. One of my biggest gripes about the product is that what is pictured isn't a good representation of what you receive. The material is almost translucent it is so thing. The door and top in the photo almost looks like a velvety material. In reality it's an extremely thin translucent material that doesn't hold any shape. There is nothing "vibrant" about its appearance.
1,It is a bit flimsy, but has buttons, so my son loves it - not sure how long before it breaks.  The phone only has a couple of sounds, so not extremely entertaining to push several different buttons and hear the same thing over and over.  Wouldn't pay that price for something like this again, but it works for what I need right now.
1,Very disappointed to realize I need to run to Walmart at the last minute because 1/3rd of these eggs would not go together. Also disappointed to realize I could buy eggs already put together for the fraction of the price ($1.98 for 48 eggs at WM) lesson learned. Photo attached is the eggs that could not be put together, mostly because the tops were bigger than the bottoms.
1,Customer service has been amazingly helpful but overall really disappointed with this product.  I love Melissa & Doug and saw the furniture in the doll house at the public library.  The stuff in the library didn't look great but I figured that made sense given the number of kids handling.  When I received new in box the tub faucet was broken. It is a little piece only glued on top. 2nd box also had broken part.  Customer service shipped a new ones immediately.  But I can see now that the spindles on the towel rack are weak and.  Will not be surprised if break off in future. Not expecting faucets to hold up for long.  So sad.  Not like usual Melissa & Doug stuff.  Made in China making a difference?
1,When plugged in, the indicator light didn't light up at all and it didn't charge the battery. As I can see from other recent reviews in the last week or two, I am not alone. Must have been a bad production batch?? Thankful for Amazon's excellent customer service and the quick sending out of a replacement one, which hopefully will work.
1,awful
1,One daughter wanted to get this for my other daughter as an Xmas present.  Both ended up being disappointed.  No matter how long we used the little light pen, even after changing batteries, the gel never set up properly.  It ended up being a big mess with a bigger price tag than we would have liked.  Perhaps our pen was faulty, but I wouldn't recommend this based on our experience.
1,supper thin plastic not what you think rips so easy.
1,Arrived late but also feel this is WAY overpriced for what we received.  Had I not already shown my granddaughter the picture I would would definitely return it...not hardly any make up ane what is in it is little and not much to it. EXTREMELY Disappointed!!! Must have paid for Barbie name. I got much better set at Christmas at Walmart for half this cost....plus was late and missed her birthday. ...would not recommend.
1,I bought two of these (one for each child). One grew okay and one didn't grow. Would not purchased again.
1,TOO SIMPLE
1,very poor quality. Some lasted up to 4 minutes but most lasted less than 3 minutes in the hubsan x4 107 C
1,Science project for my daughter... it was ok. Didn't work as well we expected but we used it in a different capacity.
1,I just used to at a birthday party and several of them popped while twisting! I will not be purchasing this brand again.
1,This product was purchased as one of my 2 yr olds birthday presents. She tried to use it once and has not used it since. I t is small, the crayon barely fits in the pad. I do not suggest it at any age.
1,My daughter was so excited to receive this.  We ordered it and she bought it with her own money.  When it arrived 4 days ago, it had a HIGHLY toxic smell to it (almost like paint and plastic fumes).  I told her to only put it on quickly so that she could see what it looked like and to try to hold her breath.  Since then, we've been trying to air it out.  I had it turned inside out.  I had it right up by an open window overnight.  I've allowed 4 days to go by - and the smell is still there and I don't believe it has lessened.  I'm hoping in time, the smell will fade; however, I'm starting to think that if the smell does go away, it's going to take a LONG time.  I would seriously be concerned about anyone wearing this mask longer than a quick minute for a picture due to the toxic smells.  I don't believe that a product with the purpose of covering your face should be sold in this condition.  It definitely cannot be healthy to wear.  If the smell doesn't go away in the next week, I'm returning it so that my poor daughter can get her $$ back.
1,No no no, it was a mistake buy this crap.
1,This toy falls apart easily. Required lots of duct tape but with enough rigging can work well
1,Pitiful. Let's take cherries off a tree and put them in a basket. Yup.....lame. Only good thing is it teaches some colors.
1,Junk.  Get an expensive one, this one suuuuucks
1,Cute enough when assembled, if you ever get that far. I offered to put this together for a friend's child, and was moved to tears. Seriously.		The holes are not predrilled, so you better have an electric screwdriver or this is not happening. Things are slipping apart as you try to screw them together. You will never get the battery powered sound controls for the oven attached, so surrender that fantasy right now. Worst of all though was the hole in the sink that you need to pop the facuet through: they either switched the base size of the faucet or the hole in the sink, because they hole was much too small. I ended up having to get out the Dremmel to make it bigger, and then it was fine, but I fail to see how they could have overlooked this and not mentioned that power tools were a necessity if you wanted to get this thing standing within a reasonable timeframe. When they say an electric screwdriver is optional... it's not.		its junky and I would go with a wood one if I was you.
1,IMO it is very hard to control. Neither myself or my 8 year old nephews, or my son could get it to go in a straight line. My brother got my kids a cheaper version for $3.99 at five below and it works 10x better than this one :( bummer
1,worked only once. After that only one cell charged. Disappointing
1,The item depicted is the circa 2000 version. I received a newer version of cheaper production: plastic printed on eye brows, flimsy tail,	Okay, so the large image is the better old one, the tiny image (shown as I'm writing this review) is the one I got. You must "write a review" to see the correct image before you buy.
1,cheap - doesn't even fit properly over the doors in our house, guess it depends what frames you have. It was junky anyway.
1,The dominos are extremely small and light weight...not even heavy enough to trigger the cars (which are supposed to shoot around the Loops).  Even when the cars are manually triggered, they do not make it around the Loop...they, too, are much too light weight.		When setting up the dominos, they easily fall down..causing much frustration during set up.		The set came with pieces missing.		TERRIBLE TOY.  Very disappointed.
1,none of the things are in the house.
1,With 2 small kids, we go through a LOT of crayola products. They are consistently a high quality brand and a good value- but these are the exception.	They barely show up on dark colored construction paper like they advertise. SEE PIC.	Save you let money, or just buy regular crayola markers.
1,$95 really that's greedy way to much for a 3 inch pop vinyl
1,First, and most importantly, this toy does NOT come with a miniature Sofia doll.  I'm not sure why I thought it did - I honestly don't remember reading whether it came with one or not.  But her absence made a huge impact on my opinion of this toy.  For the price, she should have been included.		Second, this set is small and flimsy.  All of the plastic is thin and flexible and looked like it would break with the slightest pressure.  It's durability is questionable at best for the target age group.  Some of the tinier pieces would be lost or broken in minutes if unleashed on a three-year-old (which was the age I was catering to with this purchase).		Third, once it arrived I did not feel like the cost ($12 when I purchased) was worth what I received in shipment.  It just did not seem like enough toy for my dollar in the grand scheme of things.  I wound up returning this item in lieu of something more substantial for the gift I was attempting to give.
1,This toy is an excellent example of " you get what you pay for". It works but in order for it to be used correctly you must fit  the mountain, grass and trees into indentations in a tray. If you don't have them seated correctly the liquid you add will not reach everywhere and nothing will happen. The grooves are not correctly sized to the items to be placed. The mountain is the worst. We were able to get everything locked in but only after some trimming with scissors. Even then if the tray is bumped or jostled everything will fall apart or pop out of the groove.		We did not buy this from Amazon. It was a gift but I wanted to comment since it made an impression on my wife and me.
1,THE LENGTH OF THE DOLL WAS THE RIGHT SIZE BUT COULDN'T GET THEM TO STAY ON MY DOLL.  ALSO BOUGHT A RED PAIR OF A DIFFERENT KIND AND THEY DIDN'T FIT ANY BETTER
1,I read a number of reviews before deciding to give this a try. Looking for something fun to play with with my 2+ year old. I know it is a little old for him but figured I could have some fun too.		Assembly was a little more involved than any track set I remember. Tracks are a little more flimsy than anything I remember 30+ years ago - guess that is "progress".		As others mention - it only comes with 1 car - and it is a disappointingly poor quality one at that. It did not work very well at any point.		Being a little thrifty I decided to run it with 10,000mah NiMH rechargable D cells. Though aware they only put out 1.2volts. Ended up insufficient to really get the cars moving and only a few of the ones I tried went around the loop.	So as a DIYer I ran 6volts and 6amps from my full sized car charger - more than enough power though not more than the 6 volts it would normally get from batteries. So it spins the cars at a good pace. Not many cars I tried stay on the track. only 3 of the rally style cars I found work best - they will stay on  the track for 3 or 4 laps but ultimately they get stuck in the release chute from the loop. Just a poor design.		I get the impression the people at hotwheels have not spent a whole lot of time with one of these on the boardroom table using it. Because they would not in good conscience have released it as is.		As for my son - he lost interest in a matter of minutes - cannot say I blame him. I would hate to be trying to keep this thing supplied with D Cell batteries and continually recovering cars that crash because of the track - not the crash zones.		Feel like returning but perhaps I will put it aside and maybe in a few years it will be of more interest. Unlike sets I used as a kid - this set is not durable, functional, or adaptable to be used with other track layouts. Bit of a disappointment really!  (I may add some video shortly)
1,Wasn't big enough.
1,Very disappointed. I got these for twins, 2nd birthday, and their older siblings. I took for my local shop rite to fill up and all but two of them had the correct opening for the helium knob thingy. The ones that didn't have the correct opening ended up deflating and looking like crap. You get what you pay for I guess. Great concept but wish they were made better.
1,I ordered it for a birth day gift but, I received a used item ( may be returned item). It is very disappointing.
1,Lol. Not what i expected. So small. Doesn't really work. Oh my...
1,As a preschool teacher I help and watch children put together a lot of puzzles over the last 20 years. This puzzle is awful. Not only did it come brand new in the box with bent pieces and paper coming off the puzzle pieces. It's a nightmare trying to get the puzzle around the hair to work. The Pre-K class was so excited about this puzzle and were left very upset or frustrated. Even as an adult I thought it was a poorly planned out puzzle and the pieces won't really fit by the hair. You just sort have to lay them there and call it good to make it work. I would send it back in a heart beat if I could.
1,We purchased this for a 3 year old. They tent constantly came unattached under the mattress. The tent was always perfect on one side and sideways or partially on the mattress. The doors had a huge gap never closed nicely like the picture. The push light only worked 2 weeks. Very poor quality. The colors were very vibrant. But for the price we were not pleased and it didn't not stay on her bed over a month.
1,Thought it did a little more
1,awful product, I bought many other rolls around town and this was by far the worst. It is to thin to do anything with. And it was not the cheapest. Don't waste your money on this.
1,broke instantly
1,Cute toy, but cheaply made. The hooks broke within a few days. You get what you pay for.
1,Thought the item would have been bigger for the cost of it - could have bought 3 happy meals and gotten 3 larger sized toys.  Not going to buy more
1,These are poorly made even for this type of toy. I was fine with them being on the small side and even a bit flimsy. The jaws move with a string tied to the flimsy trigger. I liked that they were not cartoonish. Unfortunately I was hoping to play a party game with them but that will not be possible because the jaws do not close enough to grab anything. They will not grab anything even with an adults efforts. Boo! Grabbers need to grab!
1,Very poor quality.  Definitely not worth price.  Kids were disappointed in it.  Ordered a Ravensburger puzzle at the same time and the difference is dramatic.
1,But, their heads pop off!!! The neck is so thin and cheap that they broke in about a week! Boo
1,I am going crazy with having to check colors on a piece of scrap paper before almost every use.  So many are different than the cap color it is taking time to learn which ones.  I am not thrilled witht he color selection.  The selection of light colors is terrible.  There are very few pastel colors, despite caps suggesting it is so.  Count on yellow, light grey, light-sish pink and a sort of light green.  There is no light peach. No light blue.  No light tan.  No true lavender.  There is a cap that color the the color comes out fairly grey.  You can forget Caucasian and Latin skin tones, but there is a nice deep Coppertone circa 1970 fake tan Orangy color and several browns.  Actually you do get several of almost the same colors in the green family, the pinks, greys, and the browns.  They really need to work on spreading out the tones so they seem less redundant.
1,So loud!!!
1,With three young girls at home, one being a huge Monster High fan, the kids were quite excited and had high hopes for this playset.  After getting a lecture from my 8 year old on the difference between Monster High and Ever After High and the origins of Briar Beauty, I realized I was in over my head and just moved onto the assembly portion on the set.		Assembly for me took just under 20 minutes.  I had no specific issues except I did not realize the "spine" of the book was actually a storage area where the bed was stored.  Also, the railing at the very top of the set was missing in my set, or it is hidden well enough that I never found it.  While I did not spend any time playing with the set, my impression of the set was not very favorable.  To me, the set seemed flimsy and not very sturdy.  I then turned it over to my three children to test.		8 year old:  My eight year old really liked the doll and accessories.  However, they specifically said that they thought the house "was a mess".  They also commented that it was hard to get the mask on the doll.  They gave the set 3 stars, attributing most of the rating toward the doll, which they loved.		10 year old:  Their exact words are "I wouldn't give this as a present to anyone."  They hated the fact the DJ stand in the house was made out of paper and they felt the set would not withstand any significant usage.  They also mentioned they thought the hands pop off the doll real easy.  They gave the set 1 star.		6 year old:  Similar to my 10 year old, my 6 year old did not like the fact the DJ stand was made out of paper.  They commented that it was really hard to get the doll in the DJ stand and have the DJ stand keep the right shape.  They only gave the set 1 star as well.		Personally, I do think the set feels cheap and I am disappointed that it came missing a piece.  I will give the set some kudos for the overall design, how the bed is stored, and how compact the set can become for storage.  However, I was just not impressed with the execution of the idea.  If I had paid the current price of $49.99, I would have felt a little ripped off.  I would give the set 3 stars, but I am deducting a star for the missing piece, giving the set a rating of 2 stars.		After having the set for several weeks, it pretty much sits on the side unplayed with.  My children also got the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Barbie-Sisters-Life-in-The-Dreamhouse-Camper/dp/B00IVFC6QC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Barbie Sisters Life in The Dreamhouse Camper</a>&nbsp;around the same time and that playset is still being used on a daily basis while this one collects dust.		Averaging all our ratings together, as a family, we gave the set a mean rating of 1.75 stars which I will round up to 2 stars.
1,Glue stick doesn't hold.

1,You know you're in trouble when a five year old won't eat a cupcake!!  The packaged 'cake mix' that comes with this product is disgusting.  There's no other way to describe it.  The cake is gummy and the frosting is chalky.  My MIL bought this for my daughter.  I pray she didn't pay fifty bucks for it.  I'd say its worth more like five bucks, at best.  The machine doesn't actually do anything but spin the cupcake around and move it back and forth.  That's it, nothing more to it.  Really useless		CONS:	Comes with enough mix to make three tiny cupcakes, all disgusting.  The refills are way over priced.	Ridiculously difficult to clean and the frosting gets in every little crevice.	Machine doesn't cook the cupcake like an EasyBake oven.  You nuke the mix in a little steamer then place it on the frosting platform.	The frosting will run out all over the cupcake.	And then your kid won't eat it.  Because its foul.		PROS:	You'll realize that baking cupcakes from scratch and frosting them with an icing bag is a really fun way to spend an afternoon with your kid.
1,These cups stink, there's no other way to put it.  The first thing that I noticed when we got one was that they have so many parts to remove and clean.  Our daughter also has not taken to it at ALL.  She will drink from any other brand of sippy cup that I give her (Gerber, Playtex and Take n Toss) but not this one.  I think the spout is too long.  We have an assortment of all of these brands but I would recommend the Take n Toss anyday.  They are cheap, durable (we've been using the same ones for over 6 months, including washing them in the dishwasher everytime), and best of all, there are no valves to clean or have make sure they don't get moldy.  My advice is avoid the Avent unless you miraculously have tons of extra time on your hands (with a toddler?  yeah, right!).
1,Made water in tank cloudy
1,This should not be released with this paint.
1,This was fun for about 10 minutes - after first use the pieces were not all together as only cookies fit in tube - I am sure it is a never to be played with again item unfortunately.
1,My kids loved the Lego Star Wars games because they were EASY but it had many levels and kept them entertain.		We are also big Indy fans we have all 3 movies watch them many time and were excited about the Lego Indy game. But they ended up hating the game. They had a hard time figuring out what they needed to do to move on to the next level. They'd ask me to figure it out but jumping in the middle of the game I couldn't either and had to get on online many times to find the answers on how to pass to the next level. Something I NEVER had to do with Lego Star Wars.		I wasn't going to buy the Lego Batman after the kids had so many problems with Indy but my youngest is a huge Batman fan and I was hoping they made it easy again like Star Wars. So we bought the game and again just like Indy, my son can't figure out what to do in some levels!! I find myself online looking for answer Again. I wish they'd keep the Lego games simple like the star wars one for the kids!!		I'm sure the adults Love the game and the challenge of spending hours figuring out what you need to do to move on to the next level but my 6 and 7 year old toss Batman to the side and go back to playing Lego Star Wars.
1,My husband saw this and decided our 3-year old HAD to have it.  She opened it on her 3rd birthday.  It took my husband forever to get all the pieces together - and to stay together.  The plastic is flimsy, and the parts do not stay together well at all.  My daughter kept playing with it then parts would randomly fall off.		She was thrilled with the "put Cinderella in the bath/bed option" - then wanted to do the elevator.  Well, the kit only came with 2 of those leg braces that are needed to move the doll - WAY too complicated & difficult to use.  2 days later, she was playing with the little Cinderella doll, and 1 leg popped off (she was trying to get Cinderella into the leg holder without adult help).  We can't get the leg back in at all.  The pieces are so tiny also - we've got a Persian rug in our dining room - where we set it up - I'm still finding littly tiny teacups and other pieces that have blended into the pattern of the rug.  Painful to step on, bad on the vacuum when they get sucked up!!		My daughter still loves the "fireworks".  Downside?  THERE IS NO VOLUME CONTROL.  It is LOUD.  VERY LOUD. I cannot express that enough.  Our baby - sleeping 3 rooms over, woke up when she played it the first time.		Read up on the reviews - I wish I had before purchasing.  What a waste of money.
1,The paper peels off of you have infants who still put everything in their mouth I wouldn't recommend this.
1,This was such a waste of money!!!! The marker literally went dry after about 5 minutes!!!!!
1,Errrr...this was a cute idea. If your kid likes Ever After and drawing they'll probably like this just fine. The "quill" that came with the one I ordered did not write and the feather was coming out before we even messed with it. She did like the book part though so...
1,Don't waste your money. Each of these minute Wooly Willies is so small and just are terrible to use. They come in a package all taped together. When you try to separate them be careful or you will pull the backs off of them.
1,cheap stuff
1,totally disappointed ! no runt! and only two in the pouch , little girl in tears! all the little puppies were exactly the same size! only had 3 pups
1,These snap too easily and make a mess!	My twelve year old grandson had many of them break....	Would not buy these again!
1,Not worth it. Way to hard for me...how do they expect a 6 year old to do it?
1,It does not work, I have to return it.
1,I like the flushing lights and the sirens but it made from the chip plastic and after my grandson was playing with it for a half of the hour the weels fall off and I tried to fix it but couldnt. He got very upset about it!
1,Not looking like the photo
1,too small
1,Ended up returning it, I believe.
1,Leaks!
1,My kids and the neighborhood kids used this for 1 month and it worked great. The kids are ages 7-9. The day after I couldn't return it the rope broke! Disappointed and threw it in the trash. Waste of money!
1,Dromida products suck no matter what it is. 4th motor none have made it  more than 5 batteries before dying.
1,Nice but delicate. Request for Christmas for my son and hard one night, right foot and broke it is not integral with the leg and is not articulated.
1,They look really cheap but since I never got them I'll never know.
1,My 7y/o was really excited to get this doll, and was terribly let down.  She loves her other 2 Cabbage Patch dolls, but there are so many reasons this is not a great doll. It is nothing at all like what you expect from Cabbage Patch. First, the head is plastic and heavy which makes it flop around unnaturally and a lot. Its the first thing she noticed when she opened the doll.  As a result when this very expensive doll falls, it lands head first with a thud. That may be what causes the issues with the eyes closing intermittently at best.  Although slightly lighter than the head, the torso contains a heavy block inside where the batteries are kept. This is not the kind of snuggly doll my kid wants to sleep with. Most importantly, she was not at all impressed by the things it said or did. The doll did react to the medicine spoon and bottle, but the rest of her responses seemed consistently random. We never really got the feeling that this baby was responding to her.	We were never able to get it to connect to the app at all. I tried it on an ipad, ipad mini, iphone 5, and iphone 6. We had no luck. I do not know if this is an apple issue, but either way it was disappointing. We were able to get the app to work, but it would not sync with the doll as advertised.	In my opinion, Cabbage Patch tried to do too much all at once. There have been other "life like" dolls on the market for years that are far more realistic and impressive.	Finally, this doll does not appear to be African-American. It does not say so on the box, but the serial number comes up as African-American. I drove 30 miles to find the African American version in the store thinking it would look different, and it does not. This picture is a fairly accurate rendition.  I compared the two side by side in the store and I was not able to perceive a skin tone difference. The only difference I noted was that the tiny bit of hair that sticks out under the cap is dark.	My kid ended up returning the doll to the store for another toy. On the upside, she did learn a lesson about false advertising. I'm just glad this $100 doll didn't end up in the bottom of my toy box.
1,Not bright and go out right away
1,The kitchen is very cheaply, poorly made with thin plastic, several pieces of which were already bent/distorted when we opened the box. The sounds are extremely limited and get old fast (24 hours and I'm already sick to the back teeth of hearing about Ariel's banana bread). The oven door continually falls off if my children so much as look at it, let alone sneeze near it, to the point where it's just not worth attaching it at all.		Over all, I'm very disappointed with the kitchen and will be looking at how I can return it.
1,This is not nearly as good as the Melissa and Doug one. Bad paper, poor images, barely there paint. Do not waste your money.
1,:( The crystals didn't grow and we had it sitting there for like a month. Disappointing. I wanted some purple crystals!
1,When I get the rest of the plushies we ordered I will submit a more thorough review, with pictures for size comparisons. OK for the most part but some are way too small, and even gatlin peashooter seems kinda big. Tbh shouldn't be as big as gargantuar, IMO. Inconsistent scale aside, I'd rather they be on the big side than compared to the tiny disco and sunflower we received.
1,Better options out there.  I bought this and party string.  The same size party string lasted 2x.  This silly string can ran out in 30 seconds.  As soon as the kids and I started a "battle", we had to change cans.  Very disappointing.  Silly string was much better a few years ago.  I will not buy this again.
1,I bought this for my daughters hoping that a nice wooden buggy would last them years.....turns out it lasted about 5 minutes.	When I first received it, parts of the painted wood had some sort of crusty fungus growing on it and I mean huge chunks, I can't even imagine what it was. I complained and the seller sent me a new buggy replacement within 2 weeks.  When I received the 2nd buggy there was no fungus, but it was missing the hardware.  Fortunately, I had the original buggy still, so I was able to steal the hardware out of that box.  The paint finish is just a primer, not paint, so I will inevitably be repainting it, as other reviewers have mentioned before me. The axle is too long for the body so the wheels wobble when it is pushed and the end caps holding the wheels in place are useless leading to the wheels falling off within in the first five minutes. Of course I would love nothing more than to send it back, but my little girls are so smitten with this piece is crap, pushing it around and popping the wheels back on every 20 seconds, that I don't have the heart to box it up and send it back. I'm off to the hardware store to try buy paint and new hardware. Don't waste your money, this isn't even worth half it's price.
1,STATED THAT THIS ITEM APPROPRIATE FOR 3 YEAR OLD, NOT EVER. NOT STATED WHAT MATERIALS HAVE BEEN USED IN GLUE, PAINT, OR WIRES,ETC. SHARP EDGES, WIRES, BURLAP CLOTHING AND ALL GLUED. MY DAUGHTER WOULD NOT LET MY GRANDCHILD OF 3 PLAY WITH THESE, WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT MATERIALS USED.
1,If in the 1800's they printed on off-center, crooked cut paper with pixelated designs, then these cards would be perfect. I think they printed better back then, these were pretty bad
1,It's a very cute set. However, plug does not fit properly and POURS out water. Not just a tiny leak. This was a Christmas gift. Very embarrassing and disappointing.
1,Somewhat disappointed in this product. Not as friendly for young children and the controls seem to  "stick". To the extent I may return it. Bought a similar toy(different model) and was very pleased with it.
1,This was a hit when my son saw it, but unfortunately, the stilts under the bridge aren't very supportive. They don't hold the bridge up. In fact, I hid the stilts and the train track ramps so my son was stop getting so frustrated with it. Now, we just use the plain bridge laid flat. Kid of defeats the purpose.
1,She flops lopsided in the water and only swims sometimes.  When not in the water, she is a hard uncomfortable doll.  Kids lost interest pretty quickly.
1,These are very flimsy. When stacked you must push on the top and bottom of the plate to attach a block. pressing too hard causes all other blocks to pop off. I do like that you can snap the plates together to make them stronger.
1,I bought this thinking it is similar to the one I had as a kid.  No it is made of paper.
1,Very poorly constructed so unless it is glued, no way parts stay together. No real purpose in tower. We put it together-grandson and I-and threw out after it kept falling apart.
1,Didn't come with instructions, couldn't figure out how to put the net on it. I'm usually really good with assembly but I just couldn't figure this out.
1,Fun to use but stops taking charges after a few uses. Battery is not replaceable. Now I have a very expensive "junk" draw item.
1,So dam pissed, didn't get the first time I ordered it, now I got and there is parts missing. Sucks.
1,Cheap Chinese junk.
1,I never opened it.  Description was better than actual game play.  You have to guess who said what?  That's boring.  I would think it is funnier just reading the answers outloud.  I sent it back because I could probably come up with my own set of cards to ask.
1,takes forever to blow up.  Too many different valves.  The "rainbow" does not stand up like the picture shows, as the hose weighs it down.  The pool has to constantly be refilled with water - and there is no way it is as big as it looks in the picture.  Would definitely NOT purchase.
1,Complicated to use
1,Received this a few days ago and decide to start it today. First off, upon opening the box I can see that its not new the box was already open and put back together with tape! The puzzles in side were previously fitted as I can see that the person who put them back in the box didn't fully uncrumble them.  Secondly, as most customers complain the colours are way darker than displayed on the box. Everything looks alike at the bottom making it difficult and frustrating to put together. If I wanted frustration I would have chosen another puzzle that everything looks alike!  I just hope there isn't any missing pieces! I'll update.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone!
1,First, it is VERY high quality made! NOW for the constructive criticism . this figure while anatomicly made, is VERY articulatingly limited. EVEN the large INFINITE Series HULK, is better articulated. The previous MARVEL UNIVERSE FALCON is much better(REMOVEABLE WINGS BETTER POSEABILITY(except for the feet/ankles). Articulation is more important than perfect anatiomy. Unlike the other FALCON (Or the MARVEL INFINITE Series Figures) these thighs are on a pivot/hinge (elbow type) joint. Instead of the OBVIOUSLY BETTER ball-joint, Wrists do not rotate. PLEASE! remake The FALACON in the MARVEL INFINITE Series line. WITH REMOVEABLE WINGS, with modern geometric feathers (not actual bird looking feathers). Like in the AVENGERS ASSEMBLE SHOW.
1,Although these are really cute bath toys, they get really gross quickly. Water gets stuck inside them after a bath and then gets moldy and gross and is squirted out into the next bath. To  be fair, this is a problem with all squirtie toys, not just these. But it seemed to happen really quickly with these. I guess if you were willing to squirt water out of each one and make sure it was dry after each back this might not be a problem...but who has time for that? So, if you want squirtie toys, I guess these are cute. Just beware the moldy water.
1,It speaks only in French. What a disappointment.
1,Crap. But 7-yr old Jack loved it. Too expensive for junk.
1,This is by far the most disappointing garbage truck toy we have ever bought our son. As others have noted, pieces of it just fall off. The exhaust stacks and the two pieces where the can loader on the back hinge just fall off for no apparent reason. I will likely try to superglue the offending pieces onto the truck to keep it whole, but why should I have to ??		For the sake of comparison, my son has had the Playmobil school bus (with flashing lights) for a couple years and it has held up great, with many hours of play on it.		Only thing positive I can say about it is that my son loves the play garbage that comes with it ..... looks like old bottles and cans and such.
1,Deceiving.  Water bead covered in some sort of coating.  The green dissolves and then the water bead is suppose to get bigger.  They never got that big. One star because really it's crap. second star because my kid found it interesting.  Just buy water beads they are way more fun and interesting.
1,This is 3 inches small really! Fragile and tiny
1,The music box was already wound too tight but I gave the lamb to y great grandchild anyhow because it was beautiful.  Needs some quality control.
1,Be aware that this farm doesn't come with ants.  You have to go online and pay $20 ( mine had a 50% off coupon so it ended up being $10) for ants.  This information should be in the title or at the front of the description.
1,I didn't got the right item. I got Darkrai deck instead. I didn't even got this deck. it's the wrong item!!!! I didn't even got the right item.
1,We bought these for my 2 1/2 yr old son. They don't really have a strong magnetic force on all of them. Kinda lame and he hasn't really ever played with them.
1,This Taggies toy is not much fun for baby at all! It's too difficult for even a year old baby too pull out the pink vibrating piece and when you pull it out for baby the cord is so short it literally moves for 3 seconds max! Lastly it does not hold it's shape and flattens out over time even with barely any play time on it. For the price there are MUCH better toys out there!
1,Good size, magic disappearing liquid but disappointed in product when my daughter had dropped it and It started to leak fluid. I had to throw it away. They should keep in mind that toddlers and kids use this so they are bound to drop it on the floor.
1,A lot smaller then I thought it would be.  I bought it for a 3 year old, and personally I think it is too small for that age.  Looks nice, but very small.  Ponys are no more then about 2 inches tall.  It is written on the packaging, I didn't think to look at it.
1,My son loves this for bath time! Bad sadly its already not squirting water didn't last very long
1,Then it would not work again!  Sending it back as soon as possible.  The first couple of times we used it, it was very good, but then it just stopped working.
1,the product came destroyed
1,The description says it takes 2 batteries....there is no where to put batteries. This miscroscope is a pretend toy at best. Bought for an 8 year old boy and he was so excited to try it out. That quickly dissipated, as the microscope is nearly impossible to use. You have to manually adjust this tiny mirroy under the slide area in order to get enough light to see, but the second you try adjusting to lens, the mirror moves and you cannot see anything. Terrible. And it is VERY small (like it would fit in the palm of a man's hand)
1,It's ok.
1,Very small. Not worth the money!
1,The set I received had one leg of three that was about a half inch too short.  The instructions  really need tweaking. The way they are written makes assembly unnecessarily difficult.  Also, be warned it comes with NO pre-drilled holes.  You are expected to drill through the hard plastic with an electric drill. I wasn't anticipating this so I didn't have one ready and had to do the entire thing with a Phillips screwdriver. It is made of cheap flimsy plastic. I just wanted something inexpensive I could leave at my mom's, so I wasn't too disappointed. Also it looks bigger in the pictures. My pictures are with my 17 month old, & I don't think a much bigger child could use it.
1,Cheap
1,Although these look and feel awesome they are not easy to remove.	My daughter ended up coloring many household items and I had a hardtime of removing it.'	This would be perect if it was easy to remove.	This does work great for little ones who want to color vibrantly but struggle to ( because there too young.....because you could draw with a light hand and have a bold line color outcome
1,Very disappointed in this product. I ordered it last month and just opened it to wrap it for Christmas and the bottom hinge where it opens is broken so the lid falls right off of it.  Piece of junk.  It is too far past the return date so here I am with a waste of money
1,This is a really great product! Just be aware you can purchase it for $1.95 at Target instead of the $12 + that Amazon wants for it.
1,I found the quality of both the materials and the assembly itself to be very lacking relative to the price.  I would expect this from a toy costing about half as much.
1,Would not stay open so we returned it.
1,Great concept but is cheaply made mine broke while putting it together!!
1,My children really wanted these hexbugs to add to their collection.  While they are large and the matallic finish is cool, the bugs are terrible.  Although all of these toys are fragile, the two larger ones here are more like delicate.  They are also temperamental - half of the time, we can't even get them to work.
1,Purchased for my 23 mo daughter after seeing a neighbor with one.  $21 on clearance at Target so Amazon has that price beat.  I returned the mower because I had to be the one to push it in order for bubbles to be produced.  It was just frustrating for her.
1,I bought this returned it got a new one and it still doesn't work right.  For some reason in my building at least it keeps shutting itself off in mid flight.  I don't know if this is because it is an apartment building and there is more radio interference from lights,routers, phones and such, but it happens when you are 3 feet away from the thing.  It is impossible to fly outside, the slightest breeze sends it careening.  Production wise, seems high quality.  It just doesn't work like it should.
1,Absolute junk, both cars had pieces break off within hours of opening the set.  On both cars the part that keeps the battery in has broken off, and I have to use scotch tape to keep the battery lid on them now.  The hubcaps to the cars have already fallen off.  At least 8 pieces of track have had the edge broken off and aren't usable anymore.  For a $50 set, this does not meet expectations.  Do not buy this toy, your kids will be disappointed.
1,These are not very good quality. The gems fell off the sandals on the first day and the shoes are not easy to get on. They are cute though. :)
1,Dont know what was the hype all about. Bought this for my son, he chews it like any other items I would offer to him otherwise nothing special about it. He's almost 5 months old
1,The fish go too fast to easily catch and the stiff rod (as opposed to the flexible string rods the older versions had) makes for an even more difficult time playing it. The fish are smaller than the 80's version and a couple of them have already had their heads snapped off while trying to put the game back in the box. It won't be too much longer before this sadly becomes part of a landfill and all I was hoping for was to share a game with my kids that I enjoyed as a kid and have fond memories of. What a fail!
1,The red balloons was just what I needed perfect but the 12 so called black balloons which is the ones I needed most came in all purple!!!!!!! 11 purple polka dots and 1 solid purple! I don't know if someone couldn't tell their colors that day but I was very upset!!!! I had to improvise with all black balloons which is not what I wanted to do for my ladybug themed babyshower!  Plus the dots on the purple ones was overlapping and looked sloppy!
1,The kids were generally not that excited about such a small amount of play-doh.  Some even forgot and left them behind.  I don't think I'll get this again.		Our party was outside at a playground though, so there were lots of more exciting things to do than sit and sculpt.
1,unresponsive
1,Only three of the 12 "light up links" would activate and light up. Maybe this is a good thing, because the flashing neon is very hard on the eyes. My granddaughter played with the set for maybe 5 minutes. Very disappointing and a waste of money.
1,Some neat little things in the booklet but you can find them as well as others listed on websites for free....very small and a waste of money. I should have saved up a little longer and bought my daughter a decent set, my fault but won't scrimp on something like this again.
1,I have broken 4 of these. Enough is enough!
1,Came with a hole do not buy!
1,Very disappointed books had 7pages tiny 5x7 pages granddaughter was unhappy book was so small  they charged 449 in postage I will never order from this person again
1,I bought this set as a Christmas gift for my grandson.  One of the walkie talkies does not receive messages (thought they're on the same channels) and the other doesn't transmit across the room.  No directions booklet to explain how the walkie talkie works either.  VERY DISAPPOINTING!  He did not want me to send it back because he can still pretend.  What a kid!  The other SpyX kit was a big hit because of the motion detector.  It is what made his gift!
1,The playdough molded pretty quickly.
1,Robot Kit - ATR  is a hyper inflated toy that is hardly worth the small mental effort to put together a few indistinct mechanisms that resemble dumb cranes or hulking robotics. You can't do much with it, it's expensive and math and science lovers rave about it day in day out. It's overrated by everyone who has purchased one and there's no evidence that this is any more productive for the brain than a pile of bricks. This toy is pushed by the elitist robotic sub-culture who think they are the wave of the future.		If you are using it for kids, you're better off just getting a block set, an army set, and a classical Erector Building Set. You'll even have money left over to get a bike.		This is a robotic size piece of junk. I wasted my time and money on this.
1,Almost completely Pathfinder figs/minis...paint jobs worthless...
1,These are made more cheaply than the versions we bought a couple years ago. We got them for our wooden track, but they barely stay onagain, not like the older ones we have.
1,This toy is DANGEROUS.		The towers of this toy are dangerous. I am amazed this toy has not yet been recalled by Fisher Price.		The towers are pointy and sharp, and stick straight up into the air, so when placed on the floor around a 2 year old act as little daggers sticking straight up from the floor.		My 2 year old literally almost just lost an eye from tripping next to the toy and it scratched/bruised her pretty bad from her cheekbone to her eye socket.		DANGEROUS TOY!
1,The game doesn't rotate properly.  Rather disappointing.
1,This is what kits were like 40+ years ago.  That means raised rivets and panel lines and very little cockpit or engine detail. Newer decals are included, though, and they are pretty nice.		For a little more money--or even a little less, if you look at one of the older Tamiya kits--there are vastly superior 1/48-scale Zero kits available.
1,Not very effective. Almost impossible to get the slime into the toy.
1,I ordered the dinosaur. The sound is loud and annoying. The toy doesn't work properly. It gets stuck and you need to try it many times until the bubbles come out. Poorly made product.	It stoped working after two weeks.
1,The jaw kept coming detached and teeth would get stuck down resulting in me fighting with it to reset.  Will not buy again or recommend.
1,HORRIBLE
1,Way too hard for little kids.
1,Tiny pieces that are so tiny its ridiculous and they don't even attach securely to figures. It was only $5, but I would not buy it again. My toddler did play with it, so that's why it gets two stars, but I threw away the tiny cheap add ons.
1,Fast shipping but slight disappointment. I had ordered this one by accident and was going to return it ; however i missed the return by deadline. Bear does not look like the picture and was extremely understuffed and way smaller than expected. The positive is it has a zipper so I went to hobby lobby for more stuffing to attempt to get it to look halfway like the picture.
1,My boys were super excited to receive these to use in their Morpher... gosh they are Power Ranger fansssss...		But these toys are either dry rot or not made well.  They just fell apart without the slightest of play.		I am truly disappointed and the boys are heart broken... these were Christmas day gifts!
1,Terrible! Not slime at all. Hard solid in shape of the container. Haven't been disappointed in Amazon in quite some time.
1,I bought these planning on putting them into balloons for glow balloons.  Yup, good plan, but not enough glow for my idea to really work. You could just see a small glow stick in a balloon if you looked closely.  Might be good for fishing like other mentioned, but I can't see a real purpose for these for anything else.  The glow is just that faint.
1,Too expensive for just a few pieces.  Was super disappointed
1,Worked great when we first got it but it didn't even last 2 months. Changed batteries and it just stopped working.
1,This broke right out of the box.  Poor construction.  Cheap materials. Had to return it.  Will not buy it again.
1,Judging from other buyers, this is likely a cute, fun Plants vs. Zombies toy, with one caveat - if it is a licensed PopCap item. However, what we received several weeks later from an export company in godknowshwere China was not in any way a licensed authorized item; it did not even come close: Wrong size, wrong colors, fake label and no movement/sounds. Just ridiculously wrong all the way 'round. Not even fit for a $1 store item.
1,Came with a hole in one of the air chambers so it was not the best halloween costume accessory when part of it is flopping around flat on the side.  Garbage
1,would of been better if they gave you enough Legos to have all three put together at the same time
1,Leap tv is waste of money	Kids can learn better on I pad	Boring games	Bad camera ditiction
1,The costume itself was not terrible but the wings were very misleading. For some odd reasons the back of the wings are just dark foam! The company did not take the time to finish the back of the wings so when you look at this costume from behind it does not match the front! Very poor. The mask is a cheap plastic string mask too.
1,I knew when I bought it that this was not a traditional puzzle, and decided to give it a try anyway.	Although the material is nice, as well as the picture, this puzzle is just a nightmare to do with a kid!	The pieces keep moving around, each piece has a picture on it which would make it very hard to assemble if there was not a shape outline on the frame.	Overall not a fan.
1,I got this game with the intent to have something fun that my nephews could play and enjoy for hours. I mean what is there not to say about a game with a bunch of superhero characters as toys. You would think that this would be a plus.		While the instructions were easy to read and the setting up quick, it was not worth the time to go through to set it up and play. My nephews were able to figure out the object of the games very quickly and then they started making up their own games as they got bored setting up the tower just to knock it back down within 3 seconds.		Overall, this game is too childish for the age group that it is geared for and not worth the money.
1,its cheap but okay
1,The actual product box was open and had a goodwill price tag on it for $7.99 while I paid $19.99.  That makes the consumer feel real nice.  To top it off, the playdoh that was included was so old it grew mold.  Had to throw it out. Because of that the product was unuseable and left my 3 yr old not happy when they were psyched up to play.
1,This is a very poorly written game. The repetition involved for the age level asked for is beyond boring. We did not use it more that twice; two agonizing times.
1,WARNING!!!!!  I am contacting amazon for an immediate recall of this product.  The strap that came with the swing (to allow it to be hung on a tree) just broke while my kids were in mid air. The stitching that connects the two ends of the nylon strap became unsewn within 5 min of swinging with less less 100lbs of weight. 2 kids, each between 40-50 lbs.  We are icing the bumps and bruises and are very fortunate that the defect in the equipment didn't cause more damage to the kids. Absolutely horrifying to helplessly watch my kids fly through the air when the strap broke.
1,I've seen several reviews that say it does not go off at night, but most of them had not taken the toy out of the package yet.  Once you remove the toy from the package, and take it out of try me mode by removing the plastic piece, it is so loud, and it goes off all the time.  If your child sleeps with it, even if it's not near them, if the bed even slightly rattles or move as they stir in their sleep, it will start making this weird moaning noise.  I have no idea what's up with that.  I agree with those who have posted - what kind of toy comes with no on/off switch?  We have the Scare Pal Art and Scare Pal Mike as well, and those go off on their own as well, but not as bad as the Sulley.  It is a cuddly toy, and if your child loves Sulley, they won't want to be separated from it, but you will want to be after it goes off making scary ghost noises through your nursery monitor a few times.  This toy is great for kids, but bad for adults who want to sleep through the night.
1,My son has several transformer toys that I have ordered from him off of amazon.com, including the incredible&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Transformers-Dark-of-the-Moon-Ultimate-Optimus-Prime/dp/B004SGLDM6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Transformers: Dark of the Moon - Ultimate Optimus Prime</a>&nbsp;- a figure you can read my review of on its product page. Of all the transformer toys my son has, Sideswipe is the one he is the least content with. In fact, he regrets purchasing this toy. The main reason for this is that he cannot get the car mode to stay tight when he transforms it from robot to car (and neither can I). The side panels of the car just don't fit together snugly and stay put. They are always popping loose. This takes a great deal of the fun out of this toy, as he can't drive this car around the floor without it popping loose and not looking like a regular car, anymore. Additionally, this toy is practically devoid of paint. I've seen some other Sideswipe toys that have nice silver paint jobs on them that look classier than this one. This car is just colored, molded plastic that does not look all that great. I would not recommend purchasing this toy for your kids.
1,My son loves Strongarm and the show, so I thought it would be fun to get this Transformer for him. Before even transforming her once, both of her legs came off. My son finds her really frustrating to transform, mostly because pieces of her come off frequently. I've tried to convince him to take her back to the store and spend his money on something that works, but he'll have none of it because he has this angry love/hate relationship with it now.
1,My grandson, who is in first grade, really, really, wanted this game for Chanukkah.  It was not too much money, and I guess we got what we paid for, which was a poorly operated game.  The premise was cute, but Max's arm did not work well at all.  It kept falling down, and was a bit of a hassel to put in back in its proper place.  We did not enjoy the game due to Max.....very frustrating.
1,As a child, I always loved MONOPOLY. By the age of 10, my friends and I would have hours of marathon sessions playing Monopoly, trying desperately to crush my opponents into oblivion.  Since then, Monopoly has become a gigantic licensing opportunity for different types of fictional characters from TV shows, films, cartoons and novels to add to their market. MARVEL AVENGERS Monopoly is yet another variation where the properties are all based on areas of the Avengers mythology, the pieces are all characters from The Avengers, and the cards like Chance and Community Chest are replaced by SHIELD and HYDRA cards. The board is also circular as opposed to its normal square shape.		Now, if the differences stopped there, it might be worth a go. But the main difference is that this is much more of a game that is based around children than it is for adults, or children who really love Monopoly. Eventually, the game will end and not because you've successfully bankrupted the other players, but you're just going to get tired of it because there's not really a typical win. It's more of a group play experience because as you go around, you're accruing heroic points to beat villains as opposed to crushing your opponents via bankrupting them of funds. In a sense, you're like The Avengers as you're not so much playing against each other but playing against the villains of the Marvel Universe.		Now if that sounds like a fun evening of playing a family-oriented board game, you might have a winner on your hands. But if you're looking for a cool Marvel-oriented Monopoly game, you're going to be very VERY disappointed.
1,Baby was only interested in ONE of the tags, and ONE tag only on this ball: the one with content and washing instructions. Why not make the other ones of the same material, instead of faux tags?
1,Decent price at 20 bucks, but pieces are all ridiculously top heavy and fall over constantly when trying to play.  If you sneeze you will have to start over because the pieces are going to fall and scatter.  Pieces are cheap plastic and bases are undersized.		Also, why no emperor piece?  Common, man.  Emperor shooting lightning bolts would be a cool dark side king.
1,We are a board game family and horse-lovers, so this game should be perfect for us, but this game is HORRIBLE.  If you enjoy Monopoly, stick to the original.  What really ruins this game are the incredibly stupid "Horseplay" cards (equivalent to the "Chance" and "Community Chest" cards in the original game).  They say things like, "Do your best trot around the room or pay $50."  Sorry, but that is just plain dumb unless you are 4 yrs old.  Or trivia questions like, "Which two horse breeds on the board are named after their color?  If you answer wrong, pay each player $50."  Well, it doesn't take long to simply memorize the answers if you play the game more than once, so those trivia cards become boring.  Someone who knows nothing about horses and was asleep on the job wrote up those cards.  We've played this game three times and it is now in the Goodwill pile.  Don't waste your money.
1,I was very excited for this table. But after having set up for less then a week the plug in the bottom began to leak. I can't put the water in the other side or I can't dump it and clean it with sand in it. Otherwise I would be happy with it. Nice height and the kids love it.
1,Very flimsy.  Poor quality.  Good for a limited number of splats, and then it bursts.
1,Not all were hollow and some were filled with granite.
1,Disappointed. Very cheap looking. You have to practically run with it to get it to blow bubbles. I was trying to find my granddaughter something real looking so she can help her daddy mow the lawn. She has zero interest in this.
1,Broke after a few weeks, not very durable. A tent I bought for less and that was smaller is still okay and was mistreated a whole lot.
1,Like most of the larger solar figures, this one doesn't really move too much.  And, the bases on these are not very decorative.  Would have been better if they just left the base plain rather than trying to awkwardly dress it up with a couple of green things that you can't tell what they are.
1,too flimsy.
1,This picture is deceiving, this block set is TINY.
1,very disappointed in it because the sound is so slow you can barely hear the music. First time I have ever been disappointed in anything I ordered
1,Cape is thin and was already fraying when I took it out the package.
1,Need to come up with a better chair. Kids cannot push it down because there's nowhere to push it down besides the head Kids cannot push it down because there's nowhere to push it down besides the head
1,Very cheaply made. One was broken in the package. I gave them to the Good Will Store.
1,breaks super easy...looks cool
1,Fisher price is a reputable toy company with lots of innovative ideas and this CAN be one of them if and when it works. The killer app here is of course, the fact that the doll will remember you child's name and incorporate that into the speech.		The problem is that these dolls were discontinued several years ago.  The software has not been updated since.  So it will NOT work on Vista, or the upcoming Windows 7 (as tested on RC1). The last software it will work on is probably Windows 98; therefore buying this doll means that you essentially have to maintain a computer with an old operating system (unless you happen to have an old pc lying around).		There are several versions of Elmo and other characters, it may be necessary to check each one to see if it will work your computer.  Given the high costs of each of these dolls, this can become a very expensive and frustrating enterprise!		These dolls are great if you can find one, pay the high prices, and get them to work.  Shame on fisher price on not maintaining them, and having such a short service life for their products.
1,It's unclear if this is actually non-toxic. The pieces are flimsy.
1,They have air bubbles in them. They broke with minimal use.
1,I love to put these wooden puzzles together. They take some work and patience, but they look good when finished and decorated. I do have to say that this was a little more difficult than most of the others. Of course everything had to be glued and sanded. The biggest problem that I had was with the animals. There was difficulty getting the animals out of the wood sheet. They are very fragile and some of them are not laser cut all the way through so be prepared to take extra time getting them out of the sheet. Also, some of them had a tendency to split a layer of wood off and had to glue the little pieces back on. The instructions are a bit different also from other wooden puzzles. Some of the pieces do not match up with what is on the pattern, but since they are duplicate pieces-it doesn't matter what number goes in which slot. And you have to think a little before you glue stuff together because if you put it together by the instruction it will make it harder to build. Example: they have you putting the braces on the wheel where the animals go before you put the animals on the wheel. That will make it a lot harder to put the animals on. The animals are just kind of sporadically placed and some are too close together. The animals closest to the wheel are a lot better looking than what is on the outside.  I did a lot of referencing with the photo on the front. The wood is fragile in some spots and broke. I had to improvise and leave off a piece or two so that I could clamp the middle of the wheel to the base. And finally, the panels that go on the top- the slots will not fit. They are about 1/2 inch off and will not fit correctly. I ended up having to just glue them in place. So the top will not look very good. This is not for a small kid to try and put together and you can't let them play with it. It will not hold up. I wish I had more positive things to say about this. The main reason that I stuck with this and finished it is because I'm making a zombie carnival and I needed the carousel to complete. And one last thing-be sure to punch out the holes, (pieces H & I), in the top of the carousel before you put it together. It will be a lot easier than waiting until you get to that part. Very easy to damage the pieces where they are located. Glue and sand everything. this is the first puzzle that I would not recommend to anyone.
1,Dissatisfied with this clay. It says that it's soft enough for little hands to mold and use it. Well the two packages I received were hard as rocks. No matter how long I tried to kneed and work on the clay to make it soft enough for a 6 and -7 year olds to use it couldn't be done. The clay could only be used for hard snakes. Very disappointed as this was Christmas gifts.
1,This product did not work for us. I am so disappointed, this has been the first crayola product that has let me down. The first time my 3 year old use it, 2 of the markers rubbed off on the outside. You can barely see the color. It comes with a stencil but the markers won't show anything
1,over rated for intended hobby
1,When I first purchased this product I was pleased.  My grandson had received it as a gift for one of his birthdays and the children and I enjoyed playing it.  That is why I wanted one for my home.	We have only played it about 4 times and the musical timer broke; the game board does not stay together very well (unless you have it on a smooth surface - not carpeting); and the stickers come off the game pieces.  The box is not sturdy enough nor does it pack away well.  I paid too much for it and could not even find a contact address to write the manufacturer about the timer.  The children ask about it but I tell them it is broken.  WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!  It is a shame company's do not take pride in their products to make them durable.  It was not man-handled by any means.
1,Broke very easily
1,Very disappointed. The buttons stick and it is hard to see the hold buttons when pressed. I had another Yatzee game I bought years ago that was great and it finally died so I bought this to replace it and wish I had looked further and skipped this one.
1,I am not thrilled with these headphones. That little crown on top broke immediately. That wasn't a huge loss though. The bigger problem is that the cushions covering the headphones fall off relatively easily, and they're absolutely impossible to put back on. You can spend 20 minutes easily trying to get those things back on. I'm currently buying a new set of headphones for my daughter, so I felt compelled to leave a review saying how disappointed I am that I had to replace these so soon after buying them.
1,By the amount it pleased my son, but not the quality. The price does not warrantHorrible, not worth it
1,Fishing pole line gets knotted easily making game useless
1,I bought this for my 4 year old before a recent trip, figuring it would fit in our luggage and be a fun new toy to play with once we reached out destination. My son is very creative and good with building toys, but with these, he got quickly frustrated at the limited range of connections this set provides. Because of the angle of the piece connections, you can't really build anything besides funky triangular or hexagonal geometric shapes. My son was amused for a bit when we made a large wheel, and managed a few times to make things resembling flying machines, but for the most part quickly bored with the set each time he attempted it. It has not been played with at all since we returned from our trip and he was back with his old familiar Lego.
1,These tiny Legion Class figures (sometimes called Commander or Cyberverse Class) are way overpriced for what you get. They're good for tiny hands, and transform easily, but you should get a weapon; their hands are molded to hold one. These are practically the same size as one of the LEGO minifigs blind bags and those are only $3.99.
1,I'm not that impressed with these Stardolls in general. While they have such nice clothes and details, they have no articulation whatsoever.  Their arms and legs are as stiff as a board.  The head and arms are about the only parts you can move.  I understand these particular dolls are really made just for dressing like a little mannequin, but it takes the fun out of it if you cannot bend their arms and legs into poses!  And I HATE the painted bra and panties!  Painted on clothes always look stupid.  Their faces are nice, though their lashes are a bit too much.  Basically, the best things about these dolls are the clothes.  If you really want these dolls, go to Toys R Us store and buy them on clearance!
1,Terrible product.  the microphone stopped working after 1 week.
1,This had the potential to be a fun toy, but it keeps going awry. I had high hopes - this is probably the most "realistic" baby phone available, and has fun sights and sounds that could keep baby's attention.		When we first received it and turned it on, it was stuck on one "tune" over and over, it wouldn't do any of the other functions. Instructions said to remove batteries, wait a few minutes, and replace batteries. We did as specified, and it worked again for a while. It has now done the same thing again, and I essentially gave up. I wouldn't have given up so easily if the battery door didn't have screws. It's a lot of trouble every time it goes haywire to unscrew the back.
1,My 3.5 y.o. grandson really wanted a Pteranodon, which is my only reason for not returning this figurine. It's dimensions are pretty much as described and detail is good, But it seems a pretty poor specimen for $9.00. Overpriced should be included in the description. I find some solace in the two-day Prime delivery and will pretend the shipping cost was $6.00. It is probably worth checking dollar stores or other sources.
1,Much better quads on the market.
1,Started putting this together for my daughter's birthday, which is tomorrow.  One of the wheel pins is too short and can't be properly attached.  Ugh.  If there was an overnight shipping option I'd do that but there isn't.  Will have to send the defective one back and wait for a replacement.
1,The smell is pretty strong to this stuff, it is kind of like glue really...in fact it is just the same as the glue I got from amazon previously. You lay down a bead and then hit it with a UV LED and it "hardens" quickly. Only it doesn't really harden per se...it just gets more firmly rubbery. You can build the things they suggest, but it's only 3d once you assemble. You won't be drawing up from the base most likely. I had a disappointed girl on Christmas.	"It's cool" she shrugged, but hasn't touched it since that first trial.
1,Doesn't come with any packaging. I bought it as a gift and all it looked like was a little tackle box. No picture or	Anything on box showing what it is and also no instructions. Cheaper made then I expected as well.
1,Super cheap plastic. Breaks easily.
1,I went to open this box and found that I had received the Canadian version of this game...with Canadian money.  Nothing on the site says or shows that this will have Canadian money....I will seek to get the American money version as I am most upset about this.  I sure hope I won't have to pay to return the product so that I can get the correct version!!
1,Wow talk about cheap. I have no idea where to begin. Let me itemize.	1. There are a lot of little pieces. They do not always look like they look in the assembly booklet. But your troubles have only begun.	2. The pieces snap together with a dull sounding snap, almost as if the slave labor who built this monstrosity is laughing at you by proxy. Don't count on the snap holding, unless of course you put the wrong to pieces together. Expect that connection to be the envy of the JB WELD crew.	3. See the cute backgrounds? Cardboard. Flimsy cardboard. Flimsy cardboard with a tiny bend to it, just enough to not allow the piece to sit in its frame properly, and it falls out -- assuming you can get it in to start with. Get some tape.	4. See that blue and pink horseshoe shape on the top right? Your color may vary. Mine was a weird single color red. To snap it in place needed the Hand of God to press down with force enough to create diamonds.	5. See those little loose pieces? Throw them away right away. Or wear boots for a week in the house.		I'm always one to say that these tiny pictures online cannot do any product justice. In this case, the picture cannot show you how evil, ill contrived, inadequate, poorly designed, and decrepit this hunk of plastic from Hell really is.
1,The concept is great. Execution is horrible. It's like they came up with this amazing VR collaboration puzzle/game and then outsourced it to the cheapest company in India they could find to execute it (sorry if that's not PC). Image resolution is terrible. Puzzles are impossible. Collaboration doesn't really work. The VR has major flaws. If you were to use this as a prime example of VR to someone they would think it was a joke with no hope. I hope other packs are better otherwise buying the viewer was a total waste.
1,Leg broke within 5 minutes of playing with it.
1,This version of blitz wing stinks for collectors as well as kids.  It is designed horribly and will not transform completely firm except for robot mode. It falls apart constantly when my son plays with it.  Buy the original version on ebay. At least the original G1 stays together.  Huge waste of money!
1,Unfortunately this barbie was a big disappointment...the wings  stuck in the middle every time my daughter or I try to switch it into a dress.......I wish I can return it but I orderit for international shipping .....
1,I was very disappointed with this product. The area provided to turn on the music selections does not work in the colored area. When pressed several times it will eventually play but obviously is too discouraging for my twin girls who are just learning to play with their toys. I have removed the item from their toys and replaced it with another product that plays every time. This product must be related electronically tho the Baby Einstein bouncer who's keyboard stops working after a months use. After reading all of the unhappy reviews I decided to buy another bouncer.
1,This toy is ok, but complicated and hard to switch back and forth.  My 3 year old son does not play with this very much. Thought he would like it more because he loves dinos.
1,My 2 year old son LOVES mickey mouse so i was so excited to give him this for christmas.  The "trap" door doesn't work and if you manually push the mickey and minnie dolls down it they get stuck on the slide.  the dolls are too big to sit securely on the plane attachment or the table and chairs or the slide.  my son doest seem to mind these design failures but i do!
1,We received this is a gift for Christmas 2017.  Its been a year since all the bugs and it is still extremely buggy.  Still get error codes even after update you download.  Sometimes lights work, sometimes they dont.  Sometimes the elevator works sometimes it doesnt.  Kids are a little disappointed as it doesnt always work as intended.  Not worth the money because of all the issues.
1,Not so much fun.
1,the plastic on these toys are hard-plastic, not the kind that has a give. unfortunately had to return, but it's a good value for money if you are looking for additional colorful toys for your baby.
1,BEWARE THE BATTERIES I GOT WERE WIRED IN REVERSE. Red was negative and black was positive.
1,These are OK, but they lose mass, form, and function fast.
1,Flimsy and not very child friendly. Parts keep falling off and one part was broken when it arrived. No room to play with dolls in it.
1,The doll seems to be pretty nice. Unfortunately, her face paint seems a little fragile and rubbed off on the box when her face got squished against it in transit. That her mask was down also made it hard to tell how her eyes are placed. The product box doesn't do that much to protect her and is open at points on the edges from the squishing. It's really not a particularly well designed box. If you order her I'd recommend doing it alone or with items that won't put much pressure on her.
1,I did not like the feel or the smell!
1,We bought this for our just turned "2" year old grandson.  After we each played with the demo items, we agreed that it did NOT seem very intuitive.  We have watched him play with his parents phones - both Apple and Android OS - as well as the Kindle, and I think this Fisher Price toy is just not up to date with the newest types of interface systems.
1,One of the buttons stopped working after a week. The others still work so it is not a battery issue, too bad because it was a good toy otherwise, but too expensive to break that fast.
1,It did not erase the first picture. Amazon processed the return quickly and easily. This one even had decent reviews, so not sure what happened with the one we got.
1,I am sure this is a good product, the figure is well detailed and looks cool, but I bought these for the code to put into my assassin's creed game.  However when I tried to use the code, it is ONLY GOOD FOR XBOX 360, PS3, and PC.  NOT the Xbox One or PS4!!		It doesn't explain that anywhere, I had to contact support to find out, here is a letter from them in regards to my question;		"Hi ThommyGunn79,	I apologize, but the McFarlane promotion codes will not be available for next-gen consoles. The teams involved tried to ensure they were able to get these codes available to players, but as many factors of both next-gen consoles were unknown, it is now concluded that this content will not available for the Xbox One and the PS4.	Again - I apologize for the inconvenience and have submitted this ticket as a complaint on your behalf."		So again, if you want them as collector items or toys, good figures, but the codes in the package will NOT work with Next GEN which was my hope.
1,Pro:  It's much much much more sanitary than other options.  It holds a decent amount of toys for a child.  Holds enough for two children but be prepared for fighting.  Who am I joking?  Two kids enter the bathtub at the same time and there will be disagreements over who gets what toy.		Con's:  suction cups dislike uneven tile surfaces which our tile is sorta.  We still got the cups to work but they have to be in just the right spot.		Bag shape is weird and makes for lots of toys being on the bottom.  Which means little arms are reaching into the bag with enough force to pop the suction cups off.
1,My 2 year old grandchildren didn't really like it.
1,Pretty cheap cars, only 2 of them even worked correctly. But hey you pay for what you get.
1,really small
1,Loud!
1,Poorly made. Some of the parts will not stay together or they are molded wrong. Would not recommend
1,It's... Ok, I guess. Not much interaction. Kinda lame. Makes noise and keeps their attention for 5 seconds.
1,A bit disappointed. The rules are way too vague. We never really got to play the game. Not knowing the EXACT rules made us all too frustrated and confused to play.	Developers need to be more detailed with the rules.  Once they add more details i can see this habe being enjoyable.	As of now I wouldn't recommend the game.	Note to developers perhaps placing a video on YouTube or Amazon would help to understand how to truly play squirrels.
1,They are ok.
1,I saw this at TRU and decided to get it on Amazon to save a few bucks.  Love the design, characters and Batman!  Too bad the main feature of the car does not work.  The motor does not activate.  Called Fisher-Price and they said to change the batteries.  Tried that and it still did not work.  Shipping back to Amazon today.  I would wait till they fix this problem.  The funny thing is that if you go on Amazon or TRU there are comments about this problem everywhere and at Fisher-Price they siad they have not gotten any calls on this problem. Hmmmmm....
1,The idea of a machine/toy that takes old broken pieces of crayons that otherwise would have been thrown away and melts them into new and unique crayons is good, however this product has a serious design flaw.  I rarely give a product a two -star rating, but I have been very dissatisfied with this toy.  The crayons do melt well but only  if you turn the timer back and give it about 5 more minutes of heat, but what has consistently malfunctioned and is a critical aspect of this product is that it will not pour the melted crayons into the tubes.  I have tried many times to get it to work properly and each time after the crayons have melted a knob on the side of the machine is supposed to be turned counter-clockwise to raise a plastic arm located on the side of the metal crayon melting tray which is supposed to push the crayon tray up and into pouring position.  I have made sure that the crayon melting tray is properly inserted, and test turned the knob many times with the crayon tray in position prior to putting in crayons for melting.  When the knob is turned on a dry run it will lift the metal tray into the proper pouring position.  However, when it has melted crayons in it the lifting mechanism fails each time and only tilts the crayon tray side-ways causing melted crayon to run over the side of the tray onto the top and into the machine.  This is very frustrating.  This is a terrible design flaw that could have easily been made to function.  I hate to sound like my mother but toys are not made nearly to the quality they were when I was a kid.  It astounds me to consistently buy products that used to work great when I was a kid, but now function at a mediocre level at best.		I discovered that the clear-blue plastic cover can be left in the "up" position so waiting for the machine to cool down enough so that it will release the cover is not necessary.  With it left up, I can take a butter knife or some other tool to hold the other side of the crayon tray when turning the lifting knob to pour the melted crayons into the the 3 tube apparatus.  But this product is supposed to be used by kids and not by grown-ups with degrees in physics!  The tubes, once filled do a fairly good job of forming crayons if you are very careful and don't overfill it.  Otherwise you will have big squares at the end of your crayons which actually, are pretty cool looking and can be used to make the crayons stand straight up - like a rows of Terracotta Tomb Soldiers!		IN SUMMARY:	1. It will melt crayons but will only make 3 at a time.	2. It will take about 20 minutes to thoroughly melt the broken crayon pieces.	3. The tray containing the melted crayons does not lift into the proper pouring position when filled with melted crayons.	4.) It can be used with the plastic cover in the up position if you lift it up before beginning the melting process.  Otherwise it locks into place and you will have to wait until the machine cools down enough and releases the cover.	5.) You will have to buy a 60-watt candelabra bulb since it includes a pack of nice new unwrapped crayons to melt into into nice new crayons but does not give you a bulb.	6.) The melted but cooled down crayons are fairly easy to pick off anything that they may accidentally get poured onto.
1,There are many other tie models. Just avoid this one. Wings are poorly designed and built.
1,It pains me to write this review. For the price they were asking for this product this should have been better made. I'm grateful it was free because it would have been returned to Amazon for a full refund.		First for those of you wanting to order as a gift, be sure that you're home without the person who's receiving it as a gift being around because it ships in the manufacturers box so everyone knows what it is.		On the bright pink barbie box it looks gorgeous, something that you may want to live in if you're a Barbie but putting it together was almost a nightmare. There are no well written directions and it took us close to an hour to put it together and that's if all your parts are there and none of them are broken. When we finally did get it put together with batteries installed, none of the electronics worked. And these were brand new Duracell batteries.		This in my opinion is just one very expensive piece of plastic junk.
1,Product arrived open & missing pieces. Description was not accurate.
1,These are the mini teeny tiny tubs of play doh. I thought they were the full size.	$4.99 was NOT a great deal for these, I could have just went to the store and paid that, considering that's the actual price!	Very misleading.
1,This little guy is fun to look at, but cannot make it through the water.  I had higher hopes for this toy. It just does not have the strength to swim across the top of the water.
1,not a very well made toy im not happy with it but at least my child likes it. The arms are very flimsy and the toy doesn't stand to well at all.
1,So, so close to finally having a great Catwoman made.  Unfortunately, as others reviews state - no matter how wonderful this figure is - when the arms snap off within seconds of removing it from the package, it really doesn't matter how great everything else is.  And these aren't just arms falling off that need to be reattached, but actually snapped at the peg at the elbow.		The sculpt and portrait are exquisite.  The figure looks like it just stepped out of the cartoon and is very likely the most accurate Catwoman figure I've ever seen compared to their inspiration (in this case, Batman: The Animated Series).  The only slightest visual "blemish" is the visible hip pegs which are oddly placed in front - but I know, they are always trying to appease the "moar!" crowd when it comes to articulation.  She also has boot-cut articulation, which is just awesome - I couldn't believe it.  That said, it was needed because even with the visible leg pegs, the hips themselves don't really move.		What else is in the package aside from the figure is really amazing, when you look at what Mattel's DC figures come with at this price point.  You are lucky to get a single accessory with their figures - but DC Collectables really jazzed this up.  TWO sets of extra hands in various poses (with the two hands already on the figure, that's a total of SIX hands in the package!), a nicely detailed whip (easily the best Catwoman whip so far, not just string, not just plastic - it actually coils well and looks good extended, so rare!), a well-painted necklace for her to "steal", her kitty cat companion (who himself is articulated!!), and finally a small "device" that I don't immediately recognize but from the packaging seems associated with the particular episode this figure has been based on.  When you look at the Mattel DC figures (including their various Catwoman) at the $20ish price point, you are lucky to get anything at all and in total there are an extra 8 items in the package besides the figure.		But...as others have stated, the arms snap off almost instantly.  There is no reattachment unless you super-glue them, which defeats the purpose of all the extra hands, etc.  It's crushing.  The left arm broke pretty much as soon as I got it out of the package, one twist and it snapped.  The joints are very tight at first, quickly loosening all over the figure (but not too loose, and most have that great "dial" articulation where each position clicks into place) - it seems the arms are just *so* tight that the plastic snaps before the joint allows movement.		At first I thought perhaps it was just an anomaly, perhaps the plastic was still too cold and brittle from being delivered in the cold winter months, but after 48 hours in my house at room temp, as I was packing her back up to return I checked out the right arm a bit and it instantly snapped off.  So she's lost both arms now, and I am used to handling fragile figures - I didn't force anything, I was as gentle as possible while still making it move.  There simply is an issue with the elbow pegs.		I would have *run* here to give it 5 stars if nothing had snapped (you see how I gush on everything else); even with the snapping, I would have given her 3 or even 4, assuming that it may have been a freak error.  But when I came here and saw that on this brand new figure that was just released days ago, the other two initial reviewers had the same exact issue - it's a 2-star to me, because it obviously is a wide-spread issue and not an anomaly.		Again, so so close...
1,Um, no.  Bait and Switch.  Batman is very dull grey.  Not shiny at all.  This one's going back.
1,The hairs seem to just fall out of the mane, and there were several areas where it appeared that the hair was burnt, and had to be cut out.  Not impressed with the quality.
1,were not as large as advertised
1,IF YOU BUY YOU MUST BUY LIKE 5 BOXES TO FILL A BATH! IT'S SUPER DISAPPOINTING. WE BOUGHT 1 BOX AND COULD ONLY FILL ABOUT A 5" BATH AND IT WAS RUNNY AND WE USED ALL OF IT IN THOSE 5" OF WATER!!
1,My parents bought this desk for my almost 2 year old daughter for Chanukah.  We were very excited about this gift and we thought that our daughter would love it.  When my dad put it together, I was disappointed that it did not come with a little chair or stool, but I figured I could look past that.  However, I quickly learned that this desk has a major flaw.  The desk is designed to lift to reveal a piano.  When the plastic top is down to cover the piano, it can easily be lifted.  It doesn't lock into place.  My daughter accidentally slammed the plastic desk onto her fingers.  We also have a baby and I immediately became afraid that the baby would try to pull up on the desk to reach for the piano and end up getting her little fingers hurt.		Believe it or not, this serious design flaw was not the only problem with the desk.  Not one hour after it was assembled, it stopped working.  We tried using different batteries - even though the batteries we put in the first time were brand new - and it still didn't work.		Normally Fisher Price toys are great, but this one should have been better designed.
1,The fittings and machining are so poor that it wasn't fun for 5 seconds. My son was so disappointed and that leaves this father feeling angry that any company would dare to market such a poorly manufactured product.
1,I am having constant bad luck with ordering black series figures "brand new" from Amazon. This one had a giant slice from a box cutter across the top and the box was banged up pretty good. I got a deal on it and it still displays nice on the shelf so didn't bother sending the behemoth back.
1,They don't last very long --- and I certainly wasn't expecting them to be as robust as punch balls.  But a 4-year-old and I went through the entire package of them in less than half an hour.
1,It arrived broken.  The wire to the battery inside the toy was cut off by the ballast. Water gets easily in. The toy is unusable as it sinks without the propeller working.  My son is heartbroken.
1,Returned this, wasn't happy with the quality.  Very hard to take down.
1,Ambers head was loose in the package and even after opening it will not stay on.
1,I bought this pool and was ecstatic the first day, my daughter loved it. By day two the supports for the top started getting soft (deflated) and by day three the top was completely collapsed on the pool, so my option was to either hold it up or empty it out and re-inflate it. The top and bottom use the same air supply, so you can't just inflate the top. This pool would be great if it had hard plastic to support the top. I ended up returning it and purchased a $10 pool (same size) and a separate canopy.
1,This thing does not work at any level, Period!	I should have listened to the poor ratings and reviews but I somehow thought it might be just OK but I was wrong.	If you're lucky, you might see the shadow of the edge an an image.	The adults in the house could not even get this thing to work as advertised
1,I bought it as a gift and my daughter loved it until the leg broke off the same day she got it.  She is very careful with her toys and just went to sit the doll down and it broke.  This is the 2nd doll I bought in which the leg broke off.
1,I purchased two of these in February as a "Today's Deal." I didn't get our pool up and running until July, so I missed the time to return them. I wish I had inflated them before that! One of the loungers kept air in it, the other will not keep air in it and I haven't spent the time with some liquid soap to find out where the air is leaking out. So, basically, although buying one was a real deal at the time, doubling the price by having one of the loungers that is unusable makes me feel like I got taken. Caveat emptor! Purchase something that you are going to use right away, or test it right away so that it is returnable!
1,Ball deflated after a few kicks!
1,didn't add much to the game as far as cards or concept.  avoid.  not worth the money it cost.  should have read the details more closely.
1,Little small but had to make it work not enough time to get another one in.
1,Don't buy....unless you don't mind it randomly singing and making very loud noise in the middle of the night and waking your kid up. Cute concept but would not recommend. It does not have an off button and at best only works 1/3 of the time.
1,Having grown up with Playmobil sets, I was really excited when I found this set that said it was suitable for my toddler.  However, upon opening the box on my son's birthday, I found that the toy contains small parts that a two-year-old child could choke on, and some of the larger parts of the toy were scratched and dented from rolling around in the huge box without padding.  The second point falls far below the first point on importance, but it's still an issue for me.  I have posted pictures of the toy size, the marks on the toys, and the huge box it came in.		The flower and the toy cat are both smaller than an inch and a half.  The flower head is right under 1-1/2 inch and the base of the cat is exactly 1-1/4 inch and gets smaller towards the head.  Considering that my son can stick an entire Ritz cracker (which is 1-7/8 inch in diameter) in his mouth, I could easily see both of these parts becoming lodged in his throat.  I found the "U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission" Small Parts Regulations and they state: "A small part is any object that fits completely into a specially designed test cylinder 2.25 inches long by 1.25 inches wide that approximates the size of the fully expanded throat of a child under three years old."  Well, maybe these parts don't fit in that cylinder, but I'm not taking that chance with my little boy.		As for the marks on the toy: The box the set comes in is huge and the parts have no padding whatsoever.  The small parts are divided into plastic bags, but the large pieces are free to bounce around against each other.  Now, maybe this toy would have eventually been scratched up by son, but after paying over $65 for a toy, I expect it to come in pristine condition.  I managed to get some pictures of the marks (should be under the item pictures on the main page), but I couldn't get the lighter marks to show up.		Bottom line: I'm hoping that I can return this item, but if not, my son will have scratched up toy to play with in a few years....
1,Doesn't fly! Poor design!
1,Warning screws fall out very dangerous im not sure if ours is faulty sending back :(
1,Be careful with this product. It's got one horrid flaw: the handle. Other reviewers have mentioned this, and it's a serious dealbreaker for me. The packaging and website never mention that the handle does not stay upright. This is such a major problem because my son will push the mower along, then faceplant due to the swiveling handle. He's practically walking on his own, and has tons of fun with other toys that you can lean on and walk with. Avoid this unless your child is walking, I suppose.	My son loves the "poppity" balls, and other features on this toy. There's quite a bit to play with. So, it's fairly well-designed and interesting. I just can't get over the moronically designed handle. Actual mowers aren't designed this way, so what made Fisher-Price think this was a good idea? The "music" and "learning" modes are nothing special. There's nothing unique about the melodies or words, really. I feel that there's no real creative juice flowing in the baby/toddler toy market, and that's sad. The actual mower features seem interesting and different, but that's ruined my generic songs written and recorded over someone's lunch break, as well as the poorly designed handle.
1,Sad but true -- this is not a child friendly toy.  It does little or nothing and does not encourage creative play.  My grandsons gave it 10 minutes and have never played with it since because you cannot.
1,Those were the first words out of my 4-year-old granddaughter's mouth when we opened the box. And frankly, I don't blame her.		The box promises "Puzzles, games, coloring pages and more". It says there's a 100 page activity book inside. Well... I can't say there's any false advertising here. But it sure was a lot less than we expected.		First of all, our idea of an "activity book" is something that typically includes stickers (a big hit with most little kids), various games, and diverse other entertainments, including mazes and coloring pages. The activity book that comes with this set is really nothing more than a coloring book. No stickers; very few other "activities", and those that are there are really extremely lame.		The shoulder bag that comes with it is virtually useless other than to transport the "activity book" and the markers.		The markers themselves are almost useless. VERY poor ink flow. Lousy quality.		The munchkin was bored out of her mind with this set in under ten minutes.		If I were buying this set in a store, I'd value it at under ten bucks. As of right now, it's selling here on Amazon for thirty. You're paying for the Disney name, IMO.
1,Save your money...figurines were too small
1,Difficult for little hands to squeeze. I wish it had a a carrying case for the extra balls.
1,Not as funny as I had hoped. We ended up pulling all but a couple of the cards out of play because they just weren't funny.
1,This is perhaps the most difficult game I have ever encountered and I am fifty years old. Maybe I am just uncoordinated. My 8 year old also found it very frustrating.  This is billed as a travel game but the sound of the bells would drive you crazy and it is very hard to keep tracks of the bells.
1,We bought this for my daughters 7th birthday.  For the first couple of days, she loved it!!  It does jam pretty frequently but that was a minor setback.		Unfortunately, the auto button is getting stuck very often.  I am having to pry it out with a screwdriver.  The gun doesn't shoot without that auto button.  After I unstick it, it will work okay for maybe a day or so and then get stuck again.  I will not buy an auto/electric nerf gun again because of this.  My daughter is going back to the single shooters and manual guns because this one malfunctions too often.		Looks awesome and when it works, it IS awesome.  Maybe we just got a dud but we're not thrilled with this purchase.
1,We got this kit in the mail last week.  My son was very anxious to put it together.  But the manufacturer had evidently cut or crimped the wires leading to the motor when they had cut off the insulation so just a little handling was all it took to break off the wires where they were soldered on to the motor!  Buyer beware, this toy is not likely to last very long and if it stops working that is a good place to look for the problem!  We're buying the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Elenco-AmeriKit-Learn-to-Solder-Kit/dp/B0009Z3JJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Elenco AmeriKit Learn to Solder Kit</a>&nbsp;to teach my son soldering so he can try to repair it - may as well make lemonade when life throws you lemons!
1,This is possibly the worst squirting flower one could imagine - it doesn't work! You pay for what you get with this cheapo gag, or should I say non-gag.		It's almost impossible for the stream to spray because it gets caught on the cloth flower petal. If you do happen to get a spray out of this, it will spray sideways or spatter.		A waste of your time and money, I wouldn't recommend anyone buy this. It's just a piece of plastic that will be shipped to you before immediately being thrown away and shipped to a landfill.
1,They started falling apart before they were used more than twice.
1,Not as in picture, it's not the original blue border but the black vaulted one, I had 2 sent out and both are black, item is priced to high for it being a vaulted one
1,Junk. All of the green bases fell off. After glueing and re-glueing, we finally had to drive screws up through the posts from the bottom. Now the tops are falling off. Seriously, if you're buying for child's play, keep looking or you'll spend a lot of time repairing these things.
1,The figurins are tiny way smaller then expected.  Can't move there arms or anything.  Not a fun "toy"
1,waste of plastic...please don't dispose of in the ocean. 5 minutes of mildly fun entertainment.
1,Not bright and intensity doesnt change easily.  Sometimes you have to hit it kind of hard
1,I bought two of these at the same time. One was broken upon arrival, and the other broke shortly after from my kids' use. Next time I'll stick to splurging on the real deal. These are cute for sure, but okay quality at best.
1,While I give this model points for style, in practice it falls short.  We purchased numerous Nerf models to give to kids at my in-laws house for Christmas (which of course set things up for an afternoon of Nerf wars in the basement - FUN!).  While all the others worked well, this one was very finicky.  It was understandable that with only two "arrows" available and a unique design, it would take a little longer to load up.  However, when you follow the steps to load, it is hard to get it to release.  The arrow has to be set just right or it won't fire, and it is hard to find the sweet spot.  Additionally, the trigger is a hard pull.  While the other models were enjoyed, this one got set aside.  Perhaps with with practice they'll find the sweet spot and can use it for target practice.
1,My 4 yr.old grandson wanted a woodpecker after seeing a real one recently.  I thought he would enjoy the walkdown woodpecker and he did for about an hour.  It stopped working after that.  He was obviously a little too rough on it, but it was cute while it worked.
1,One of the handles is already broke. Difficult to put together. Radio Flyer needs to fix this problem.
1,If this is your first Pop On Pals set, the one pal that comes with it is going to be very lonely. I think it would be a lot more fun with at least one more pal. There are 3 seats in the Ferris wheel. I couldn't get it to go by pushing anything as the instructions tell you to do. The weight of the one pal did make it go until it was at the bottom. The pal, itself, seems very sturdy and should hold up to the play of a 2 year old, but I don't think the rest of the set is going to hold up. The rest of the activities, knocking down bottles, ringing the bell, making the ride go back and forth all worked as they were supposed to. It does require 3 AA batteries, but they are included.		I need to comment on the packaging. I know manufacturers package items with the store display in mind, but I wish they would also consider the people who are purchasing this as a gift and will have plans to wrap it. This would be very challenging to wrap. If you are getting it from Amazon, wrapping it in the big Amazon box it came in would probably work best. I also found getting it off the packaging was very challenging - far from frustration free. There are 13 twist ties to untwist. There are also several tabs that needs to be cut before you can even get to it. A child would be tired of waiting by the time it was all done.		I did receive this item through the Vine program, but they shut that page down for some unknown reasons.  Since the product is still being offered, I thought my review might help some to make a decision.
1,My 7 year old got this from Santa. She has played with it non stop and Monday morning his leg fell out and now it's just hanging there. This is a piece of JUNK.
1,I ordered these for Halloween game prizes at school.  I looked at the pictures and read the description  (which mentioned something about being great for boys and girls alike ) and thought they would be perfect.  Unfortunately,  out of 35 bracelets, 29 are geared towards girls.  My pack only had 6 solid colors that are orange or yellow,  every other bracelet is a traditional girl color or girly print.  Now I will have to order some extras specifically for the boys.  Not happy.
1,Very bad quality. Very misleading - too many small thing in half empty can!
1,I bought this for bead work and such and was surprised how cheaply constructed it was. It doesn't fit my head because while it's adjustable, it doesn't stay locked at the adjustment I set it at, making the band holding it on expand. Aside from the unit falling down to my nose every 2 minutes, the stabilizing adjusters don't tighten much, or practically at all. This causes the lenses to slide down easily. It's really cheap garbage and the only reason I gave it 2 stars was because the price was low. Even so, I don't feel like I got what I paid for since its construction is so poor it doesn't even function as it should.
1,Not very durable! Just days after opening, several pieces broke off. Also, the "smoke" it emits smells disgusting, like burning plastic. Surely not something anyone would want their children inhaling.
1,This toy has been a constant source of frustration since I bought it.  The toy itself was defective.  The slide part did not have holes that lined up so we had to glue it.  The swing set constantly fell down and wouldn't stay connected.  We tried gluing it as described in many of the reviews only to have it break beyond repair.  My husband is in the playroom at this moment with glue and packing tape just trying to rig this thing together enough for our daughter to play with it.  I am really disappointed.  I usually love Plan Toys and loved the activity bus.  Save your money on this thing though.
1,I bought this toy, few days back. It is the worst product I ve ever bought online.		Despite, being applied my all Engineering knowledge, the Space Shuttle didn't revolve on the string as it was advertised.		Finally, after I get failed to make it work, I opened the toy with the screw driver. And I was shocked to see that only a simple small Motor with a small fan beneath was there, without any gear or other mechanical system. So, $ 11 is too  much for having nothing useful inside.		Bad, rather very bad product !		Moreover, I found small signs of scratches beneath the toy. Thanks God, I had opened and checked this s***-product before being gifted.		Highly NOT-Recommended Product.
1,She loves it at first easy to break.
1,Lots of "debris" on the sides of the jar as the water evaporated and a tiny formation looking nothing like the photo at the bottom of the jar.  Won't purchase again.
1,They smelled horrible and had white powdery substance on them blew one up and instantly popped most of them didn't keep the air super disappointed
1,Lasted 5 days indoors before it mysteriously sprung an unpatchable leak. The ball is too expensive for such poor quality.  You overlook the cost because they claim it is virtually impossible to break and they will replace it if it does... Yeah for $8 plus the cost of shipping the valve.
1,too small
1,Not as pictured, son begggggggged for a hulk with blue pants, this one has purple pants.
1,Sad. My son picked this out in the store and after recharging the battery we went to use it again and it wouldn't work. Why? We realized the battery is not secure in any way to the truck and kept slipping backward and losing the connection. That is asinine for a product of this price point. We finally realized why it wouldn't work and taped it down. TAPED THE BATTERY. That shouldn't be a task we have to undertake for an item we have used once. The plastic of the truck and the remote are both flimsy, so I know this toy won't last long.
1,I am not impressed. These things are tiny. Not at all action figure sized. More like something from a gumball machine. Disappointing!
1,Cheap & so small it doesnt stay on. Bought for my 4 year old daughter & 6 year old neice. They love dress up but i don't see these getting much use & probably will end up broken in the trash quickly.
1,Cute but broke in record time.
1,I received ths set for my 5 and 2 year olds to play with and was disappointed with the overall build qaulity of the product.  To start, the included race track is made of very thin plastic that easily bends/warps/rips.  Putting the track together is very simple, however, we were unable to get any "races" to complete as the track would not sit flat.  The cars would end up crashing into each other or one would get hung up somewhere on the track.  After several attempts to get the track to work, I basically took it apart and put it back in the box.  Useless.		As for the cars, they do offer some fun.  As others have stated, the cars use a srange method of winding them up by attaching the front and rear sections of the car and then twisting them until fully wound.  The cars do move quite fast on a tile floor so the kids had fun with them.  However, we noticed that several of the cars (we got an additional set of vehicles for this) do not stay together that easily and a simple bump will have the two pieces break apart.  Here is where fun began...my kids decided to play a type of demolishion derby where they would be at opposite ends of the kitched and release the cars at each other.  Whichever coar stays togteher, wins...		So overall I would skip this set as the build quality is nowhere near other manufacturers.  But, if you do happen to own these or still want them, the demolishion game isn't that bad!
1,Received all dented
1,Baby hits himself in the head with the plastic part and it hurts!
1,Would not stay upright to be used. We tried both water and sand. A big disappointment
1,had a whole in the ball part  and holes in the pins too so no did not like them
1,Not impressed
1,The "altitude hold" is a terrible gimmick that inhibits normal flying. Look up some YouTube videos about this. This "feature" is universally hated and can not be disabled. Either buy an older model Hubsan or wait for Hubsan to realize how stupid of a mistake they made with the "altitude hold" feature and correct it, then buy. If you are new to quad-copter flying, this will teach you bad habits. If you are a seasoned flyer like myself, this feature only inhibits correct flying. This is a gimmick and in no way like the real altitude hold of the DJI Phantom.
1,This item is very cute but too realistic as it has begun shedding worse than the real pup.  Very disappointing as it was a gift for a friend who was extremely excited to have a replica of her lost pet.  I guess it is only good for a short time
1,It is a very cute product, very catchy for kids. I give it one star review because the ink pad was totally dry. I gave it as a present so I couldn't return it. I wish whoever is the person the checks the quality of the products would catch this little details.
1,the car was cool but the remote stopped working right away.  My son was devastated.
1,The quadrocopter comes in a nice little box which is great for travel. I got this becuase I wanted something fun to do inside when it is too windy. The first 3 flights were great. It was very fast and extremely stable which i loved about it. But the next few flight were not so good. It started to go backwards during hover and a little to the right. So a little trim fixed the problem. But It was getting steadily worse to where I had no more trim to get it to hover. It eventually was not able to be flown. So I changed out all the blades and rebound it to my transmitter. That worked at first but then it did the same thing. And after about another 5 flight of getting it to hover, it just wouldn't get off the ground at all. So I had to return it.	************UPDATE  8-22-13************	I just recently purchased the nano qx again. The first few flights it was great, but it took a long time for to self level itself. But I could live with that. But after about my 5 th flight, I saw a huge decrees in powerful. So I went to the manual and did everything that it's told me to do. But that didn't help. So I had to return it for the second time. I would definitely not recommend this product as it is very unreliable and I have had all sorts of problems with it. Blade should do some more work on it. You should try to stay away from this product.	******************update 10-2-14*******************	After quite a bit of time, i have decided to get it one last try. Again, it fly great for the first few hours, then it developed that drifting habit. But the main problem this time is that the at about 30 feet, the connection was lost and the quad flew way up and then the motors cut. It landed on a 3 story building. So that's my 3rd nano qx that has failed me. I honestly don't understand all these positive reviews. Maybe I have gotten terrible luck. Blade is a very good company but this product is absolutely awful.
1,There isn't much to this toy and the little pieces were lost quickly. Put your money toward other toys even those more expensive.
1,I bought these for my kids to use for the tooth fairy when they lose a tooth. There are 144 and is say a majority of them do not close. I figured for the price we would never use them all so I toss the broken ones. Wish they weren't so cheaply made.
1,broke in the first couple days. very poorly made! Better off buying from walmart:)
1,The big one was impossible to set up it kept going back to being flat
1,There is no way to easily charge.  You have to unscrew a cover.  Poor design Power Wheels.
1,Disappointed in the product. Ordered them for my sons birthday and they were extremely thin and flimsy. So much so that they were practically see through.
1,The containers weren't tightly sealed, the sand was loose in the bag which had a hole so my entire order was covered in neon sand. A big mess for sure.
1,My two year old has been gifted a LOT of toys since she was born, and this is probably the worst.		It's difficult for an adult to activate the motion and IMPOSSIBLE for a young child. You have to press VERY firmly upward on the elephant's nose (awkward) or smash it against something. Once you do activate it, all it does is vibrate and play a giggly song for a very short period of time.		I'm not sure what the toy designers were thinking when they put this one into production but it's TERRIBLE. No interactivity, no entertainment value, difficult to use... avoid at all costs.
1,Came yellow!
1,To work, the water fills the ring and spurts out of holes punched on the top.  The problem is that there are so many holes, in order to build enough pressure to make the water spray reasonably high into the air, you have to turn the water all the way up.  Turning the water all the way up means a lot of water ends out on the ground.  We had a mud patch within 10 minutes.  Plus, the kids quickly discovered that they could make the water sprouts "jump" by stomping on the ring.  The ring held up from the stomping, but the kids at our water party were 4.  I doubt it would have lasted the whole party with older kids.  My recommendation: skip this and get something else.  We'd of had just as much fun with a cheap garden sprinkler from the local hardware store.
1,I was just going through my e-mails to collect all my information to call Amazon when I found this request for review.  We bought all the figures that were offered at this time and were planing on purchasing the remaining when they became available in February.  The problem is they are not durable at all.  This figure has a movable head that just broke off on the second day as did the arm on the mad hatter,  killer croc was just standing on the table and fell over.... on the table and his arm broke off.  My son is almost 9 and he takes Very good care of his toys.  This is very disappointing.  We would like a replacement and if it happens again I'll request a refund.  Killer croc alone was $44.65.
1,They leak.
1,They lasted 3 days before the thumb was torn off.
1,Was missing one piece and never got to return it because I bought it to early from when I gave it as a gift. Over a month so I was stuck with999 piece puzzle
1,I bought this toy for my son because I remember having the racing ramps garage from the 80's and I loved it! This toy, however, is horribly constructed. No matter how hard my husband and I tried, we just couldn't get the ramp pieces to fit together to create a flush surface. So the cars would periodically get stuck or run off the ramp because the pieces did not fit together properly. My son got bored and moved on. I ended up selling it at a garage sale for $10.
1,My almost 3 year old little boy recently received this toy, as well as another Kid Galaxy remote control toy, and then a third RC car that was a no-name brand.  All three toys suffered the same problems:		1.  Battery life short.  This is a complaint I don't often make, either.	2.  Remote control operations are very imperfect.  I can't tell you how many times I've heard "why is it not working?"  I don't think it's an issue of interference from other household gadgets...these things just don't work well and give the impression of being designed very very cheaply.	3.  High initial interest for the child, tailing off very very sharply.  I think each of these toys enjoyed one partial day of being my son's favorite, and after that they've been completely forgotten and ignored.		I will say that watching a 2 year old boy figure out his first remote control toy was really fun for us as parents.  But would I recommend this toy or either of the other two similar ones?  No way.  There are countless better ways to spend money.
1,I was extremely disappointed in this Ice Cream Scoop Set.  There is a magnet in each of the ice cream scoops that works really well lifting the ice cream and setting it on the cone.  The problem is that there is nothing to hold the ice cream on the cone.  Every time my granddaughter tried to walk with the ice cream cone the ice cream fell off.  None of the scoops stay on the cone well at all. She got terribly frustrated. My son-in-law finally put double backed velcro inside each of the ice cream scoops so they would not fall off but could be pulled off but no one should have to do that.
1,I love my Nerf Phoenix LTX taggers which are hard to find these days so I was pretty excited to see this set with such great reviews and a reasonable price. Unfortunately I think reviews might be fake. The battery compartment is hard to open. Construction is poor. One of the six guns I ordered didn't work at all and one could tag but not be tagged. I returned all six guns.
1,Sucks that they're different colors. Got a rainbow one, the least thing wanted.
1,Don't waste your money I tried it but when I make my movies it goes to fast
1,It popped right away after I blew it up. It  scared the kids. It was cute up to that point.
1,I was excited to get this game, and thought it would be a great one for the wife and I to play-- after several games, it has just fell flat and I have no interest in getting it out of the box anymore.  It's a real shame too, b/c some of the game design was great... just not enough of it.		Pros:	* Theme - the game has rules that really support the theme well.  The "Darkness Spread" cards make each enemy faction feel like a different group with only slight changes.  The enemy action cards are the strongest point of the game-- really, really well thought out.	* Pieces - the quality of all the game pieces were great.  Even the box made storing the game easy.		Cons:	* Takes a while to set up and play-- not a major issue.	* Multi-player is weak-- most co-op games have this problem, where the game digresses to a veteran player instructing new players on what to do, and therefore they aren't playing but along for the ride.  One mechanic to correct this is to have a "winner" in a co-op game, so that there is still a sense of competition.  DotR does this... sorta, but in a game where the designer has said it has a 20% win rate, you can't capitalize on this.  To win the game at all you have no room for any game changing play to make you the hero-- right place-right time.  There's no difference in a 4 player game, than a single player playing 4 heroes.	* Hero balance-- some heroes are fun and awesome, some are rather weak and lackluster.	* Rule clarity-- there are a few (only few) cards that are really hard to understand (Cavalry Sweep being the worst offender).  There is a FAQ and online help for this, but at least one "clarification" from the game designer breaks the games rules to make the green general harder... which I just ignored.	* Almost completely luck based-- this is what killed it for me: there really is not strategy passed the basic.  There is no counter-play, the quest cards go from Awesome to why bother (and some of them make you risk the game for a 1:3 chance to get the item), or you need a really good draw from the Darkness cards.  I'm used to winning and losing some games b/c of good/bad luck, but after someone figures out the gist of the game, the play requires little choices and lots of luck.  Let me repeat-- this is much more luck based than say a card game like Spades which still is swayed by good and bad hands.		I really wanted to like it, it's just not there.
1,It was cracked and didn't work at all. I didn't even send it back, I just threw it away.
1,I was excited when we received this toy as a gift -- I think M&D products in general are pretty neat. But about 10 minutes after my son started playing with it, he burst into tears as he had gotten a huge splinter in his finger. I took a closer look, and it is quite obvious that when the holes were drilled in the tool box, they were drilled too fast -- the inside of each hole was broken out like it had been punched through, and there were up to 1/8 inch slivers of wood that could easily break off of the product. The wooden bolts also have some drill issues -- the paint is chipped around the holes (it was clearly drilled after painting). Even the inside of the wooden flat pieces to hammer or screw through are somewhat rough. All in all, disappointing craftmanship on what seemed like a nice product at first.
1,I read the bad reviews on this & decided to go used from an auction site.	I still spent more then this set is worth as it went into various recycle bins 2 days after the purchase.	My son was SO excited to open this on his birthday only to find mom had to work over an hour to get it stable (using sure-track) The trains get stuck on the way down & you need to push your hands in to move it..this knocks down tracks & the crying begins...do this for non stop for 2 days...in the trash it went.	I plan to try another spiral set before next Christmas. This time I will test it out in private so I can avoid upsetting a toddler who still thinks I should be able to make even a piece of junk work properly.
1,Pretty flimsy and cheap.
1,Bought this at a different location, worked for about 30 minutes and stopped working.  Also, you can buy at a local big box store for $4.99.
1,Not good. Falls apart easily.
1,Mattel made this fusion because they didn't want Clawdeen to eat vegetarian. As a matter of fact, Werewolves SHOULD eat vegan if they want to be part of some children-targeted franchise!		I've seen werewolf carnage on TV, and believe me, it is far WORSE than that of a Vampire. So much, that I don't even wanna see another werewolf eating meat!		I think Monster High should be shut down for ignoring ANY moral values of family friendly entertainment, period!
1,I bought 2 Grave Digger color shifters, received 1 Grave Digger and the other was not, disappointed!  Gave them to a 5 year old and 3 year old at a birthday party, and neither one changes color, very disappointed!  That is very costly for a small car that does not change colors, as advertised!
1,Avoid these!!!  Cheaply made.  I used them with my nursery class and the bells were flying right off.
1,I order this thinking it was for the mini erevo its not. its for the 1/10 scale erevo. but customer service was really good with me.
1,I needed something small.  And all the others are like 26 squares.  It looks cute, but in fact each image is composed of a bunch of pieces.  Like a puzzle. Some are quite small and fit in my sons mouth.  My son kept taking it apart and putting the little pieces in his mouth.  I had to finally take away the small pieces but it looked weird.  So I don't even use it anymore.  Plus any spit up gets in between the squares.  I bought this one insteafd and couldn't be happier&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Baby-Care-Play-Mat-Friends/dp/B0058K5IIQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Baby Care Play Mat Friends</a>
1,The kids really like this. But straight out of the package, as I was removing all the tape and things the yellow stripe on the vest ripped up just from pulling a piece of tape off of it
1,This doll is beautiful and excites kids when they first see it. But after a minute or two of playing with it, the choker breaks, the hair is too tangled and messed up (and unable to return to normal without it falling out when you brush it), and just doesn't hold my daughter's interest. She played with this a few times, then left it buried in the bottom of her Barbie box cause "it just wasn't very pretty anymore." I got my other daughter the Barbie ballerina doll, and that doll was more flexible, fun, and durable for both my girls to play with, and the hair stayed in when they brushed it. I'm going to have to get another one of the ballerina Barbie's for my other daughter, otherwise continue listening to them fight over it. :0)
1,If you have ever played the earlier version of life please do yourself a favor and avoid this "new" version like the blak plague. My friends and I used to play the old version every single day up to late hours. Once we learned the new version was out we ran and bought it. WHAT A DISAPOINTMENT!!!! Compared to the old version this one is HORRIBLE. It isn't fun. The new rules [are not good]. You can not bet anymore. Money isn't the way it used to be (what's with the litte pieces of carton?) Maybe if someone at MB reads this they will go back to the basics and bring back what was once a great and fun family game to play. Lucky for us we still have, and play with, our old and much better version of Life.
1,Got these for an educational activity for my 2 year old. I really don't get the point... Kind of a waste of money. Threw away
1,Product is made out of cheap plastic, the workbench is cracked and the drill is ruined on the top
1,this is one figure only complete rip off
1,These are useless - they just barely hold their own weight on a vertical surface. Forget about actually using them as magnets!
1,We love all the other boon bath toys (especially the pipes) but these creatures don't really do much. I don't get it. They're cute but that's it. Try some of the other bath toys, there are several others that are much more interesting for a 3 yr old.
1,Overpriced. Returned.
1,This thing is a piece of junk. Falls apart constantly. Yuck.
1,Cheap crap in a novelty box.
1,Terrible! I was so disappointed in this product. The product itself looks cheaply made, and it is quite a small box. In fact, my mom just said she found this companies products in the dollar store.  I wish I had known before spending way too much on this item. More disappointing was the box itself. It was ripped in one area, the corner was squished in, and the seal on one side was half off. It was meant to be a Birthday gift for my child's friend that likes super hero's. It looked so bad I had to buy another gift. Do not buy this!
1,Came broken. Ok, for the price.
1,I chose this for my 2 year old twins Christmas over the pottery barn version. It's adorable and my girls love playing with it. When shopping for items like this i do rely on reviews and that's why I'm sharing. Set up was a little time consuming for my husband but that can be expected with so many parts. There were a couple of flaws like the sink already chipping but we accepted it because hey it was cute at a fair price. After one month of play somehow the backsplash has been torn clean out of the countertop including bolts... My girls are each only 24 lbs...maybe I'm at fault for not supervising them while playing with it? We have many wooden toys from other brands that are in excellent condition after use. I have contacted KidKraft and because damage didn't occur during shipping they will not replace the parts without charge. $40 for a new countertop (minus the accessories) backsplash and shipping. I was hoping they would at least meet me in the middle if not replace free of charge just to guarantee the quality of their product and good customer service. Very disappointed because the girls do love it but for a toy we have had for 30 days it is already an eyesore because it's torn up. First KidsKraft purchase and my last.
1,Seam ripped with in minutes of play! Completely rip off.
1,I bought a pair of these for my sons, 3 and 5 years old, for Christmas.  Totally uninterested.  They've been using tablets for a year or so, and thus the watch is rather simplistic for them and haven't touched the watches since opening them and setting them up.  If this is your kid's first experience with cameras, touchscreens, etc., then it should be fine.  If your kids are already versed in these things, I'd guess they won't be interested.
1,I am disappointed with this toy. I bought it because my daughter's legs were still too short for a tricycle but this is even more frustrating. The steering wheel is just decorative. and the plastic wheels do not rotate. It is very very difficult for a child to maneuver around in this. Plus it was a pain to assemble.
1,When I bought it my son didn't ride until he is 2 year old then the rubber straps broke at 2 front legs.
1,Maybe I misread, but I expected this to be larger than it was. It works great and sounds great, it's just too small. My average size 2 year old can't "dance" on it like it shows on the pictures of TWO kids playing on it.
1,Not a fan at all.  Bought for my 3 y/o for Christmas to go with his Ninja Sewer Playhouse thing.  Bought 3 different Turtles, all listed and sold as a different Turtle.  They were all the exact same Turtle, same color band and everything- just had different weapons.  Lame.  He got much better ones from family.  If I had the packaging still, 'Santa' would be returning these..
1,I tried to return these, but UPS kept coming by right at the time I am supposed to pick up my kids from school. These do not work hardly at all. They barely glow, and what part does glow does so very dimly, to the point that you're not even sure its glowing, even in the dark. Huge waste of money, and because I kept having pickup issues with UPS, I have to just eat the cost on this one. Very annoying.
1,This product is okay, but the one we have isn't a very clear sound.  It's kind of rattly.  Plus there's minimal volume control.  My son just doesn't like this all that much and I find it annoying.
1,My son received these from his grandparents for Christmas and was super excited. My husband set them up for play yesterday and they enjoyed playing with them for a few minutes until the batteries died. No big deal since they were just out of the box. They were charged over night and worked for no more than ten minutes before becoming unresponsive. Surely the batteries would last longer than that?!? Both husband and son were so impressed with them before the tanks died. He thinks they're broken but says if it's a matter of the batteries lasting no longer than several minutes, they're just not worth it.
1,Defective.  Chicken does not stand.  Reason I bought it was because it states it stands up.  Nope, it only flops over even after reworking the wire legs and claws.
1,Well... got these as easter egg fillers. They are in all sizes and the kids loved it BUT  they are now all decorating my ceiling... argh	They are not joking when they say sticky  :-(
1,Not very happy with these figures. Cubbys stand broke off when we were opening the package on Christmas; since then we've had to super glue several pieces back together. Hats have come off, figures come off their stands, and Smees body came apart. Not very fun for a 3 year old. Figures look cute, but quality is lacking.
1,very tiny
1,Aluminum rings are super soft. Screws are nowhere near long enough. The holes they screw into split immediately. Tamiya... HAH!!!! I don't believe it.  Later
1,We didn't buy this set from Amazon, but I feel the need to review.  While these are beautiful they are poor quality puzzles.  Many pieces not cut through, with cardboard peeling off the backs, the picture was not glued down well in one corner and does not go all the way to the edge leaving bare cardboard.
1,Our yumbox lasted nearly 6 months of regular use, I absolutely loved it.  Then, one day it fell off the kitchen counter and the snap closure broke off, it's not reparable and I'm back on Amazon to find the truly unbreakable bento box that can hold up to a potential accidental fall.  This is not it.
1,I expected larger and more stickers.  I've purchased other character booklet of stickers (e.g. princess, spiderman, etc.) like these in the dollar stores. Nice but not worth the price.
1,I thought that it was going to be a set of 4 brushes but turns out its is just 1 pc! very expensive 1 pc.
1,Difficult for 3 to 4 years old to stay on
1,Looks kind of akward, too long, small feet, loose shoes, little hair, kind of bald.
1,This was SUCH a cool idea in theory... in practice, the "clings" are really fragile and rip very easily. My kids were excited to make them at first, but have been pretty disappointed with the finished product. It doesn't seem to matter how long they set for either. Even after a week or more, if you try to move them from one surface to another, they will tear apart in your hands.
1,MISLEADING PRODUCT INFORMATION. Despite the inclusion of Donald Duck in the first three photos displaying this product, there is no Donald Duck in this set. I was really disappointed, and rechecked the detailed narrative about the product (twice) and noted that despite the prominence of that character in the photos, Donald Duck was not mentioned in the included (or excluded) parts. MY MISTAKE. I didn't examine the description close enough to realize that I was being misled. The toy is nice, but BUYER BEWARE-you will not be getting what they have pictured, and will need to dish out another $10-$15 to replace the part that they have excluded. This was the first time that this sort of thing has happened to me shopping on Amazon, and I hope that this review prevents it from happening to you.
1,The wooden board isn't smooth- Im worried someone playing will get a splinter.
1,This would be neat if the photos were larger and the app was available for android, I do not have an ipad or iphone anymore so this is pretty useless and we cannot practice in the other languages.  So this is basically a bingo game with tiny photos and super thin bingo chips, with the recommended age starting at 3 this is not very practical to expect that young of a child to be able to find and cover so many small pictures without scattering the chips.
1,the instructions make it not look like minecraft  my son plays on xbox. you can not play with it or if you do it would break
1,Pointless purchase doesnt talk or anything don't waste your money
1,The rear door fell immediately opened the package. I received damaged and once opened the package I did not dare to return .
1,This art set is merely OK. There are very limited colors, and the markers were dried out at first use. I would highly recommend buying from a different brand. I will be replacing this with a Crayola set today.
1,Not very good.
1,The kids like it, but I think its a pain in the you-know-what.  Mixing is not easy or fast.  Be warned lol.
1,it's cute- but didn't work well for us. When we faced the trophy down for the cars to start racing they weren't at an angle so they don't go down the ramp we have to push them. Also, it comes with a car that goes down the ramp well, but unfortunately we have a Mater, The Sherrif, and another McQueen from that bath collection and they are somehow too big. They always hit the trophy part so they don't race down the ramp either.
1,Spinner is a joke. Daughter likes it so it's a good item in general but you don't need the whole contraption.
1,Overall the doll is pretty but the panties on the back side has a cut that shows her back. I think some pervert designed the panty, or there must've been a material shortage!
1,I wanted to like this so much. I was so excited to take my son out to ride in this.	-Firstly, there are numerous defects in the plastic body--it is very cheaply made. The plastic body came scuffed and dented.	-When my husband turned the car upside down to complete assembly, the extremely flimsy steering wheel cracked. He had to super glue it. We will see how it holds.	-The curvature of the buckle was facing the wrong direction/the tightening strap was on the inside. The head of the screws would've been sticking out/rubbing against our son. My husband had to re-strap the harness so the screws would sit correctly.	-The areas you are supposed to place the stickers inside of are not sized well...making it difficult to align the stickers symmetrically.	-If this car had been under $30, I would've given it 2 stars. However, for  $60 it literally deserves zero stars. Please don't waste your money like I did...this thing is garbage.
1,EDITED: my first review follows this... The cart keeps falling apart.  Very disappointing.  Was 3 stars now it is down to 2------------ I bought this for my grandson who is almost 3.  The assembled cart is significantly shorter in height compared to other push toys he has,  The photo on the box is of a child that is *maybe* 18 months old and shorter than a 3 year old that this toy is suggested for.  The hat is not well fitting as it is basically a short cap and not as pictured.  The tools are fine, about what I would expect them to be.  My husband said that the directions were clear and easy to follow and the construction is pretty solid.  No tools were needed except some snips in order to cut the pegs apart (they are mainly what keeps it held together)  This toy would be perfect if it came with a tool belt or box to keep the tools in.  I feel that the cost without these is too high - perhaps if it were taller I wouldn't mind the lack of storage so much? Overall I feel the height makes this purchase unworthy of the cost.  It cheapens it significantly and I would not recommend giving this as a gift because it looks a little ridiculous when assembled.  I purchased this at a discount in return for my honest and unbiased review. *update* this simply will not hold together.. Makes for one sad little boy!
1,Over the Christmas Holidays I observed my grandgals happily playing with their boy cousins' Hot Wheels sets, and thought that they would enjoy a set of their own...after all, they've seen "Cars" and they love a cartoon about huge trucks.		While Mattel and Hot Wheels are known for reliable products, this was an exception. We were never able to get this product to work. Time and time again the car "jumped" the track and couldn't be cut in half.		Also - this set includes only one car.
1,Disappointing. Two broke within first hour of use. Return policy requires you to send piece of the broken ball to them and for $7 they send you an equally crappy replacement. Great concept. Overly fragile material. Not worth giving to any kid unless you want to teach them the lesson: If it looks to good to be true it probably is.
1,This is not worth the money. My 7 year old has the larger version that was only $79 and it's awesome. Save your money and buy the large one.
1,I guess I shouldn't be too surprised, but my almost 3 year old got his hands on them for one bath, and they were pretty much destroyed.  They do not stay in their little containers, and they fall apart easily.
1,The owl I received looked nothing like the owl pictured!! It has brown spots. It does not have those cute large feet as pictured. Its actually quite ugly. Luckily my kid didn't see the picture of  the owl so he doesnt know how much he was jipped! If you want the owl pictured, its not what youll receive. Very disappointed.
1,We ordered this for our son after he found it in a toy magazine.  The price on Amazon was considerably cheaper than the magazine price.  The first playset we received in the mail had a broken piece (one of the track pieces) and it could not be assembled.  We sent it back to Amazon and received a new playset.  The instructions for assembly are limited.  All that is included is one page, that includes a few images of the assembly and sticker application without any written instructions.  As reported by previous reviewers, you pretty much have to take the whole thing apart to get it to fold up into the fire truck shaped carrying case.  It does not fold up easily.  The pieces have to be put in a certain way or the truck will not fold up.  Many of the pieces come off easily, which is helpful for taking it apart, but becomes a nuisance when attempting to actually play with the toy because pieces are constantly falling apart.  The track surrounding the tower is the worse about falling apart.  Even so, my son does enjoy playing with this toy.  Personally, I think it's junk and overpriced for the quality of the materials.
1,This puzzle is terrible quality compared to the other 3d puzzles we have purchased. We love to do 3d puzzles with our older kids but skip this one. Frustrating! Pieces fit together poorly.
1,The plastic piece that connects the wheel to the steering piece broke right out of the box. The first time this thing hit the wall, the piece broke. Lame. Also, the turning radius on this truck is horrible.
1,One pokeball came broken and my kid was disappointed
1,Did not last that long...Kids broke it fast and if left out in the sun it will melt.
1,My son just got this for Christmas and it's trash. First off the dome is smaller then the pictures and box make it look. Second, you can't battle to bay's in this dome, the minute the second one hits the other stops. The regular stadiums are way better and way cheaper. Watch the video someone posted, it's truly how it works.
1,looked great on the picture but what we got it was a broken fire truck	broken water hose on the ladder	the lights on the wheels does not work	the seller told us to deal with Amazon with these issues :(
1,My daughter was not a fan of this at all. It's bulky, heavy and gets really annoying to skip. Wish I can return this.
1,Couldn't get past the first game screen as there was some kind of glitch. My son was really disappointed. :(
1,When I ordered this, I did not realize that it wasn't a complete game, but rather an addon to a game that I don't have, nor have I ever played it. I almost purchased the game in order to be able to give this a proper review, but really, I can't afford to spend money on a game right now. All I can say is it is a couple of dice and a few cards that seem to me to be pretty high priced considering what you get and the fact that the actual games that these are for are only a couple of dollars more.
1,This game seemed really cool, but my kids hated it. They didn't understand the purpose and it was way over my 4-year-old's head. My 8-year-old tinkered with it until he figured it out and groans whenever I mention it. I liked it, but after playing for a while, I got tired of it too.
1,So here's what's interesting.  I purchased two of these frames.  The first one had 3mm arms and I was totally pleased with it.  I'd probably give it 4-5 stars.  5 stars for the price, 4 stars because the landing gear arms are junk and fall off but there are holes in the arms to mount a standoff and use it as landing gear.  So I liked the first frame and the price so I ordered another.  The second frame came with 2.5 mm arms.  So I give the now give it a 2 because the first frame deserves a 4 or 5 star, but now the company is misleading people and not providing 3mm arms so I give them and the product a 1 star.  If I average my experience I end with a 2 star review and will never buy from this company again.  Now if they send me the correct sized arms, I will change my review.  I bought this frame as a backup for the original I purchased. I cant use these 2.5 mm arms in place of a 3mm arm so the arms are worthless to me.  If I squeeze a 2.5mm arm into a 3mm space I will put stress on the two lower plates.
1,Had better made pinatas` but it did the job for kids under 7. Flimsy hook.
1,Very poorly constructed, The Gimmicked pen was very easy to tell apart from the regular one... And the magnet was glued in crooked to boot...
1,UPDATE 12/2016- one year later	This sandbox did not hold up well and was trash after one year, which is unfortunate because it was so cute. I would not recommend, unless you get it for a very good price, perhaps $75. All metal components rusted, therefore staining the cloth sides and the wood looked very dumpy after approximately 6 months. I'm changing my rating to 2 stars, taking into account how well it held up and the value for the money. I wish this was a better purchase, it really is adorable.		ORIGINAL REVIEW:		We're overall happy with this purchase- it's an adorable addition to the kids' backyard play area and I hope to add the matching picnic table set this summer. Here are a few points worth noting:		-You will need a drill for assembly.	-While designed for outside use, you do have to seal the wood yourself.	-Sides blow in the wind. They are weighted down by wooden bars, but the wood isn't heavy enough to really hold the sides down. We may add Velcro as others have mentioned. Not a deal breaker for us, but worth mentioning.	-No real way to keep debris or animals out of the sand, as the sides loosely hang when unrolled. We don't have neighborhood cats (that I've notoced- I guess we will find out!), but may be a concern if you have cats around.		Ours arrived unharmed without any broken wood.		I love the idea and styling of this sandbox and the cute factor it adds to the back yard. If the sides didn't blow so dramatically in the wind, I'd give this 5 stars.		Both our 4 year old and 18 month old fit (photo attached to get an idea of size with two small kids inside).
1,Very cheaply made. The car charges from the AA batteries in the controller via a small cord. It did not work on our short carpet or our walls at all. It worked on hard wood floors and something as smooth as a door. Our 5 year old was very disappointed. Returned this right away.
1,Ok- was super excited to find this because it is such a sweet costume! I got it for a very gentle 3 year old. Size fit perfectly, she loved it! It was opened on Christmas and LITERALLY 2 HOURS LATER!!! the hem was shredding, next day the side split. I typically find that my little ones get about 1 month of wear out of their costumes, not 1 day. Really really disappointed.
1,Cheap made
1,I probably just didn't read the product description well enough but I assumed this was a set of four based on the images. It's not; it's just one.
1,As with most Play-doh toys, the concept always sounds great, but execution always falls short. My 5 yr. old son had trouble getting the hair to "grow"  and it was very difficult to clean.
1,So very tiny, almost too tiny to fit on a little three-year-old finger, A petite three-year-old. But they did fit and she does like them, but got bored with them very quickly, they are so small and no one can play with her with them. If I would've known these were this small, I would've passed on the purchase. He puppet hole isn't a half inch long
1,Arm hard 2 move
1,Not no great.
1,Every single crayon arrived broken into unusable pieces. Two were crushed and the bits floating around got waxy scribble marks on all the other items in the box. These went directly into the garbage.
1,I expected it to be larger than it os.  Was very disappointed since it is part of my grandsons birthday present.
1,This is mostly user error, but I bought this for my 1 year old and he hates it. He runs over his fingers and toes on accident and cries. It doesn't turn. At all. I mean it really sucks. It is heavy and bulky and my dogs attack it. That being said, it's made of quality materials so 2 stars.
1,Cheap plastic, lightweight, really hard to play!  This is clearly the new version, and not one from my childhood :)  You can barely push the handles down without it breaking.  It's always getting stuck, and we spend more time trying to fix it than playing with it.  Too bad, this used to be such a fun game!
1,Very average quality eggs. Buy the expensive ones if you want little better quality.
1,The screw broke and not a left-hand thread! It came defective! Horrible!! Do not buy!
1,Does not fit the stampede XL-5 2wd chassis. Maybe the 4x4 stampede.
1,Several track pieces were bent out of the box and the whole thing will not stay flat on our hardwood floor.  The barrel drop off does not line up with the car so it never worked correctly.  maybe the bent track contributed to that.  Waiting for replacement to swap out the bent pieces.  If not for the quality issues, the set is pretty cute around the tree.
1,Not as exciting as we thought would be. Doesn't spin much
1,Flimsy and tiny. Looks like a diaper bag for the doll, not for a toddler to use. Retuned.
1,Do not buy this item.  It is very cheap and barely works.  The spinners constantly fall off the line and the arena floor grooves make your spinners fall over.  My son has used once since Christmas.  Save your money
1,I really like the box, the bright colors, and that it seems like a sturdy enough game (unlike some of the really cheaply made games out there). But beyond that, this game isn't even worth the space that it takes up on the game shelf. I have a 2.5 year old and a 6.5 year old. We have played this game maybe three times. Each game seems to go on for what feels like forever. It's just a dull dull game. It's a cute concept, good quality, but just so boring. I think I'll let my 7 year old write her own rules for the game. Maybe she can come up with something a little more exciting. We'll see :)
1,Cute for a photo op, but poorly designed. Steering wheel is for looks, and tired are close together so toddler has no room to use feet to make it go. My son was given one as a gift at Christmas when he was 9.5 months old. He was too short for it. At almost 15 months, he is tall enough, but has no room to maneuver.
1,This is similar to a sand timer. It's the size of my hand. Literally from the palm to the top of my middle finger. Its clear with pink on one side of the timer and blue on the other. Nothing like the picture. When u flip it over the colors move to the other end. It's just something to have for my son while he's in time out I guess. It didn't really interest him. I had something similar but way cooler when I was a kid. This is like a dollar store toy. Doesn't look as cool as the picture.
1,This was a must have on the wish list for xmas last year. After we got it and the kids played with it a couple times, it was just kinda boring. You just launch the cars and they roll down the ramp. Not sure why we or the kids thought it would be more interesting. Just one of those toys that isn't worth the money. Maybe for a very young child's first kind of race track toy.
1,This thing is creepy. It looks okay from the front, but the back of it looks like another reviewer said. IT's tail is huge and extremely inappropriate. All my four year old could say was look at it's booty, and what is that thing sticking out the back??!?!?!?!
1,this was a huge disapointment on Christmas morning. it constantly jams and misfires do not buy single shot ones are much better
1,Too small!  Ant fit it in my babys hands and feet.
1,Did not have the correct parts.  Gave two of the wrong pieces for the above ring assembly.  I had to actually use a drill and screws to finish putting it together.
1,I was expecting something better based off of everyone else's reviews. It's a pretty cheesy costume... Made of very thin "fabric". It won't last more than one use.
1,I suppose I should have read the description better, but this does not stick onto the tile in my son's bathroom. It does say in the fine print that it will work on smooth, non-porous surfaces. My tile is porous, so I suppose that it's my fault, but still a waste of $12.
1,The spiderman was folded, which made the decoration much less attractive.
1,Looks cute but they scratched my refrigerator and some of the tiny magnets in the back came out easily. I'd rather support a business closer to home...
1,I've had other tops.  This one is tiny and it doesn't spin well.  Others have a different story.
1,Every time I move this toy there is a sheet of mold underneath it.  I try to hang it upside down when not in use.  My son is almost three and we've had it for several months. It doesn't do much and I constantly have to bleach it.  It's also very small.  Save your money on this one.
1,Another so-quick-to-market toy that they skipped product testing.		I'm not sure who this toy is for but we will be trashing it soon. My 8 year old has only just barely figured out how to OCCASIONALLY wiggle the pieces out, with buzzing. The goal of operation is to extract the pieces without buzzing but because of terrible design this isn't physically possible.		All the pieces are non-descript white sea creatures. No useful identification possible.
1,Don't stay together. Sorry:(
1,My daughter didn't care for them. The sound was also really low
1,Falls into itself and will not stay up.  The head is top heavy and my boy gets frustrated trying to pull it and it just tips back into the slinky part.  Not well made even though it is very cute.  I love the idea of retro but this isn't worth bothering with!!
1,I ordered 2 of these balloons for my son's birthday party and took them to our local supermarket to get them filled with helium, along with the other balloons for the party.  Both of the pirate ship balloons were deflated by the time we got to the park from the supermarket.  The glue or sealant that holds them together is inadequate.  These were a complete waste of money.
1,Too many tiny pieces. Gets lost on the carpet.
1,This is pretty much my least favorite game that my children have ever owned. First of all, it is a serious pain to set up, because you really have to work at getting the "ice" to fit in there. Little kids cannot do it.		Then, they bang on the friggin thing making the worst, most annoying sound other than nails on a chalkboard and incessant whining). This sound literally goes through my bones and I have a high tolerance for kid toy sounds.		Not surprisingly, this game has mysteriously disappeared. FOREVER.
1,These were the worst! I couldn't even blow them up! Once air was inside it would leak out as soon as you tried to plug it.
1,I purchased this for my grandson for Christmas.  It stated new and I paid what you would pay for this at any store.  The little guy arrived yesterday in two separate sealed bags.  Pup in one, badge in the other.  I assumed it would come in its original box with paw patrol on it.  Will have to figure out how to creatively give it as a gift so it doesn't look used.
1,Spend an hour trying to get this out of your carpet and see if you buy it again. Good gift for people you don't like I guess.
1,Terrible quality. We bought one of these from a different brand and place and it lasted a year before it stopped erasing properly. Upon opening this, not only was it smaller than expected but we have to slide the eraser 4 or 5 times and it still doesn't erase all the way. Waste of 10 bucks.
1,returned did not lie tapefitti
1,Was a gift
1,Not water proof failed first use on a wet road with light rain with 1:10 scale rc truck for nitro motor throttle servo.		Update!  The new one as well just failed aslo in my mt!
1,Too small and pups don't come out. Returned.
1,My son wanted this to go with his dress knight costumes to play with his little sisters, very sweet.  It was so cheap and didn't even inflate all the way.  Major disappointment
1,Bought it. Didnt work so I returned it for a replacement and the replacement also didn't work
1,Every kid is different, so there's no way to be sure that your kid won't like this toy just because my kid didn't like this toy. In this house, it was a ball-holder and little else.		However, before you buy this, know that it assembles with screws. You can't make different paths for the balls, you can't build and explore new constructions with your child. You put it together, they play with it as is, end of story. It's big, too big to fit through some doorways, and can't be broken down quickly to be put away, so only get it if you have space for this to be a permanent feature in your home.
1,I'm writing this review as an experienced collected of action figures. The details and sculpture is great. I don't think she needed to come with 2 different sets of hands along with the ones she already has. The thing that got me was I didn't even have the chance to do anything with this figure before the left leg broke off. That is awful. I'm sure if I had tried to really pose this figure the other leg would have broken off as well. Not impressed to say the least. Being this fragile I would not recommend it and save your money for a different figure.
1,This is so expensive, very small, not easy to clean (which is essential for baby toys), and entirely unimpressive.  Huge waste of hard earned money...
1,Unable to properly review this product. It came delivered on my doorstep in a box so soggy the mailman put it in a bag. Upon opening, the goo from inside to make the kit had exploded. It also reeked of perfume, which I'm assuming was the goo.
1,I love coloring and drawing. I am also a teacher that can never have enough pens, pencils and crayons for my students. So, I was really excited to receive this set through Vine. Unfortunately, my excitement died shortly after receiving the product.		First of all, I will say that the case is pretty nice. It separates the pens into similar colors. It is great for keeping them organized. The pens come in a nice variety of gorgeous colors. There are duplicates of the colors, but that isn't a bad thing in my case as a teacher. I actually wouldn't mind it for my personal use either. It just means I have backups.		My real issue with these pens is that most of them do not work. The ones that do, have pretty colors. However, 3 of the first 5 I tried did not work. My Husband and I tried pushing hard on the ends, swirling them around on different pieces of blank paper, and we even went so far as to take a lighter to the end of one of the pens and try to get the ink out. Nothing worked. I have already thrown out most of the pens. I would not recommend spending your money on this product. The case is nice and for that, I will give it two stars.
1,Doesn't stick that well. But is visually interesting and can sometimes get to stick if I play around with it, and yes its on a flat clean surface.
1,Just Because it's for girls doesn't mean they have to design it differently than the boys --- the color is all it takes.  My lil one was so psyched to get this and then her excitement turned to frustration because of the jamming issue mentioned by other reviewers. In addition the code thing it just not warranted.  We thought because it kept jamming that the code was required every trigger pull but no it was just jamming.  thankfully we got this 50% off on amazon because if I paid full price I think I would have shipped it back to nerf directly and told them how awful of a product it is.	why can't the designers think logically?  It's a common sense issue with respect to the design of the loading.  Such a bummer.  Talk your receiver out of this gift and have her choose a different model.  or get a boy one and spray paint it purple if it's really an issue.
1,Did not work with my son's remote control car.  The description is not clear so be careful before ordering - no free returns with this one!
1,This game's high rating here on Amazon relies on three things: 1. The Oatmeal's inexplicable popularity. 2. The viral effect that the Kickstarter had on teens and early twenty-somethings. 3. The fact that the vast majority of people in the United States still believe that games like Uno, Phase 10, Monopoly, and Sorry! are the only board and card games out there, and therefore they must be good. The designers of this game clearly have never played modern designer board games, either.		This game is utter garbage. Completely random. Too long. No meaningful decisions. Player elimination. Unfunny artwork. The illusion of strategy, when really you have no control. And there are better light card games out there! Cheap and easily accessible! Love Letter, No Thanks, Pairs, Sushi Go, Fairy Tale, Belle of the Ball, Hanabi, Parade, Timeline....I could go on and on.		Please, don't support this kind of game. We need to move on. These are the types of games we grew up hating. Why revisit them?
1,Read the other reviews first. This horse is lame - literally. My mom bought it for my 10 month old. It can't sit up, at all. If I get it balanced, the moment you walk past it or he thinks of touching it, it falls over. He's terrified of the scary noise it makes, so we had to take the speaker out. I was hoping that would make it less top heavy, but it didn't help. Why the mfg didn't make it more bottom heavy by filling the body or hooves with plastic beans or something, we will never know. Otherwise, it isn't particularly interesting to play with since the part he sees most is the belly which is supposed to be on the floor...
1,On a super smooth surface, like a basement floor, this works great.  Outside with bumps this doesn't seem to work as well.  Is the front wheel supposed to touch the ground?  It doesn't.  It just turns back and forth and the other day my husband had to put the steering wheel back on because it came completely off.  I bought it for my 3 year old, even my 8 year old has problems with it.  Then I tried it (it says up to 220 pounds and I am well under that), nope, I could not get that thing going.  The frustrating thing is I tried it a couple years ago at a toy expo and loved it.  It had been on a smooth, indoor, cement floor, not the rough, bumpy cement like outside.  Is it really that temperamental that it can't work unless it's on a super smooth surface?  If you have a large, unfinished basement, this would be awesome.  Otherwise, this is just an extremely overpriced toy.
1,When the description said 10 inches, I assumed it meant height. Its actually front to tip of the tail. The height is about 5 inches. Also, its not solid. Its hollow soft vinyl. I expected more for this price.
1,Dosent really fit correctly and is to heavy for the micro's. Dosent have as fast of lift and the controls lag with it on and it dosent really protect the blades at all.		Would not recommend nor would I purchase again.
1,It will not turn off. As soon as batteries were pit in, it turn on even though not inbthe water. Then the sensors to do not work when out of the water and dry. Had to unscrew and take batteries out to get it to turn off. Also spouting water is not like product video. Very weak and boring. Wishing I never bought it.
1,It's great but I can't get the legs to pop inside, managed to hammer in only one out of three and I even used soap as per directions...
1,Like everyone else has written - way too short for the price.  Questions are good, but you'd have to provide triple the number of cards to make it worthwhile. There's really a lot of classic rock history - I think you could come up with the material...
1,First order:	Wow!!!  Very fast shipping.  The price is awesomely low!  I expected a typical low quality china brushless motor.  But I was very surprised that they are perfectly balanced bells on the motors.  That is hard to find on a lot of these motors you find online.  The winding's are very neat and clean and are potted.  There was a tiny bit of play up and down trust wise in one motor but with a light press and tighten up grub screw it's great.  PS locktite! all your shaft grub screws they do not come done!  All the blade holders and mount kits came complete and made like most.  Good lord great price and well made for cheap priced china motors!  I already ordered another set I hope the second set is as good as the first!!  Update when it arrives!		Second order:	Well I'm kind of disappointed in the second order of these.  I have not even tested them to see if they work yet.  Cause they smell so bad of chemicals I had to put everything that came in the package out in the garage cause it was making everyone sick from the strong chemical smell on them.  Even my postal person asked what the hell was in that package that smelled so bad.  Didn't really get the fully head on hit of it till i opened it up in the house.  From what I can tell it is some kind of cutting oil or lubricant used in making the motors on them.  Or something to clean them?  Either way it's been 4 hour now out there airing out and it still is really strong.  Sadly I think these will be a lose so my 5 star rating just went down to a one now!
1,Much smaller than description, not worth the money.
1,The bow didn't last too long; the string broke. Otherwise, it was pretty cool. Wish they had included a replacement rubber string.
1,This was a gift for my grandson, he loved it.
1,too small and not clear on how to use
1,My son still owns this.  He actually still likes it even though he has long since outgrown Cars.  However, as an adult, I do not think the games are very educational.  The screen is small and sometimes it is hard to determine what you are supposed to do.  As a small child searches for the correct letter on the keyboard, the music that plays is enough to make you crazy.  I wouldn't buy this again.
1,FUN FOR ONE DAY! Just like everyone stated in all the other reviews; popped after one day!  It should sell for $1
1,Using the Color Wonder Finger Paints is basically like dipping your hand in Vaseline.  It's greasy, hard to wash off, and stains.  I would never buy this again nor for anyone else.  I strongly urge against purchasing this product.  Crayola, shame on you!
1,Our Grandson loved the helmet...but....Dad struggled with the getting it put together.  It also kept coming apart as it was played with.
1,My son used his allowance for this purchase. He is EXTREMELY dissapointed to find out of the hundred cards 26 are the exact same as well as 39 exact same. So for 65 cards of the 100 he got essentially 2 cards. Sad to ripoff a kid of his allowance.
1,Not realistic.  Tail is (maybe)	2 inches long.	It's a chopped off tail !	  Should be 6"-8"+.	As a result, my cats completely ignored it.	Had it been a normal size tail, they would not be able to resist it because they are obsessed with tails !.	On a positive note, the cat was soft.	I will donate this to a shelter.
1,Had to return item as the transformer did not completely close tight.  Very disappointed as was opened as Christmas gift.  My son worked and worked on it, but could not make it close tight.
1,The inside ripped after one use. Not happy!
1,I read the previous reviews and I thought that by now maybe the magnet would be stronger- -it's not. It works, but drops the little ball frequently which is frustrating. Also, the colors are not very vibrant. We won't return it, but are less than thrilled.
1,The idea of these blocks is great; however, within 3 minutes of my 18 mo old son playing with them, he had scraped the stickers off the side with his teeth. If your child is a drooler or teeth scraper, you may want to avoid. The drool will get the stickers all gummy.
1,A lot smaller than expected like happy meal size not Barbie size
1,LeapFrog is so Slow to connect (no it's not my blazing fast wifi/internet, like I assumed with others who complained of speed).  Also, in order to cancel out of a game, you have to hit the power button on and off.  I plan on returning this hunk of junk and just getting an android tablet and downloading a bunch of kids games onto it and set up parent control.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  Our daughter is 4, and she is getting really frustrated with trying to exit from games and also with how long it takes to load stuff....  Good concept, but horrible implementation.  Not to mention, leapfrog was recently hacked, so make sure you don't put your kids real DOB in the setup when asked..
1,I bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas and it never worked. There is no box due to Christmas morning hub bub, it got trashed.
1,Not worth the price.
1,tire is used, way worn down tread side walls are like the ones on my car and Im a terrible paralell parker so you can imagine where this is going, I assumed the tire was actually new, as its being sold as "new" rather than in the used section. the chains are great, but if I knew I was getting an old tire with holes punched in it (also there were 5 holes punched in one side and 3 on the other think someone messed up and just did more......
1,weird stitching.. didn't even look like a cat.. very disappointed!!!!
1,Love the sounds but the the jaws won't stay open to play I won't buy this again the older one works so much better
1,It's a cute toy, but not what I expected. I thought the cards would slide all the way in but they only go in a little and don't even really read what is on the card just a short version of it, a little more than I would have spent for what it was. Also the necklace broke and we didn't even have it out for a whole day, being sent back.
1,Product did not say it had spinners on the back. It does and I don't want them.
1,Bought for our Lalaloopsy dolls but the dolls were too head heavy and kept falling over. :(
1,Thought the price was awesome & the reviews were fantastic...unfortunately, they do not live up to the hype.  The bullets were difficult to load & it doesnt shoot straight at all.  Now after 1 week (a handful of load/unload)..the bullets fall out when the gun is caulked to chamber the next shot. When it doesnt fall out, the bullet just blops out and barely makes it 15 feet.  I was really looking forward to enjoying this gun playing with the kids, but it plainly stinks.		Will not buy again.
1,My daughter and her friends and cousins love playing kitchen, the only problem is that its really small, and the microwave always comes off. Its just not sturdy enough for children to get good play out of it.
1,My two year old liked this station until it fell apart. The pieces simply do not seat firmly enough for normal play. It might be good for older kids but not for those who are still a bit reckless in their play. To be fair, he enjoyed it while the pieces stayed together (about an hour).
1,The tent and tunnel is cute but what the picture shows is not what you get I was very disappointed about that because I have a slide in my daughters room where I was going to have all 3 together if I was only going to receive a tent I could of paid cheaper and I wouldn't of done rush delivery other then that it's cute
1,If you are searching for barbie shoes to go along with mini skirts and stripper attire, this is the purchase to make.
1,My son loves this owl but it ripped within a week of getting it.
1,Much smaller than expected. Came promptly which worked for me
1,Not worth the price, ok in bath tub but doesn't work well in above ground pool. Antenna breaks off easy.
1,Purchased these to use as decoration for a birthday party.  I was quite disappointed when quite a few of the balloons had pinholes in them and leaked as I was blowing them up.  I ended up having to use a piece of tape to cover the holes so I would have enough balloons to decorate with.  I purchased these due to price, but in hindsight, it was not worth it.
1,Why did they change this ? It was perfect the way it WAS in 1970's. This one requires batteries. It is smaller and cheeoer plastic and for no good reason they put a door on the little place for the records ~ dumb. If you don't know the original then this one OK..............I guess.
1,Gonna try it this weekend
1,The Lion shown looks like a normal size beanie baby. But if you look closely at the tag it says beanie baby 2.0. I didn't realize this until I purchased the product. Nor does it list 2.0 version anywhere in the title of the product. This product is very small and fits in my hand.  Also the pic makes that lion look like the ''pluffies'' version of beanie baby. Not happy with my purchase and I returned it.
1,Expansion adds some nice cards to the base game but if you add too many the length of the game increases significantly.		My poor review is because the cards were not cut with the same size die as the original game and it makes it extremely difficult to shuffle the two sets together.  I expect better quality control on expansions.
1,I would return this item but for the price its not worth it.  The light never worked at all, it just a heavy item inside the ball.  Don't buy.
1,So cheap. We throw it out within a month. It's nothing like the old one we use to play with as kids. Not worth buying.
1,The tumble container disintegrated so that it wouldn't even close half way through our second batch of rocks.  For this price we expected to get many uses... Not just one.
1,Only 2 mermaids look SEMI-normal-- they ALL actually look very poop-face drunk-The eyes are on their foreheads,their lips are on their chins..They are ugly ..... and small ....andddd I order 2 bundles of 12 at the same time and only 1 pack of 12 came the other says delay and I won't get it in time for the party and a beach bowl..so much for 2 day shipping - Very unhappy at product.... Second package came and its horrible !!! ALL the girls faces are stamped incorrectly
1,too expensive for the use of it just get cheap markers n teach ur kids not to draw off the paper or on walls DUH! parents!
1,I wouldnt buy again.  Doesn't sit flat and son shows very little interest in it and he loves to play army but this he did not seem to like
1,Broke after five uses. The motor is so weak
1,The description for this product is misleading. It says "4 Pack Crayon Boxes: package of 12", but i only received one box, consisting of 4 pieces of crayon, not 48 pieces.
1,When I bought the Hubsan H107C+ you always get the "Others Bought" this or that as options. I seen the protection ring which gave me the illusion that it was going to fit the Plus model.	It does Not fit, totally different unit and not returnable.	Do not make the same mistake I made..
1,terrible.
1,Wasn't pleased with this item at all.  A waste of money. Kids like toys the make noise to awaken their senses.  This toy is a bunch of stick on plastic.
1,Too cheap looking, wouldn't recommend it.
1,bought three and none lasted more than 2 days get the cx10 mini drone instead and save 30 dollars don't waste your time on this. But I don't get what people are saying when they say requires spesifec blades cause guess what...ALL DRONES REQUIRE SPISIFIC BLADES and this drone comes with more proppelers than most drones and these are really well built blades it's just the drone isn't a good product for 50 dollars but now that it's 20 if you know how to fly it you won't crash it to much and it will work good i bought these for 50 dollars and when i checked how cheap they were at 9.88 i was about to get one then they raised the price to 35 dollars who would buy that raelly don't waste your money 10 dollars is the perfect price
1,apart from the fact that 2 bolts were missing, this thing will rip out of the ground if used to hold down a swing that's used by any kid older than 5y
1,Battleship is purely a game of luck. You call out a number and letter based on a grid that you have in front of you. If your opponent has a ship in that location they take a hit. First person to sink the other persons 5 ships is the winner.		As a board game Battleship is pretty boring, there's really no real strategy other than to blindly call out numbers until you guess right. The components for this game aren't really anything to write home about either. What I will give it is that the grid doesn't seem to be as tight of a fit as when I was a kid. I remember putting a peg in while I track my hits and misses and I would have to force it in and when it finally popped in the force would sometimes pop out other pegs in doing so.		I wouldn't say Battleship is a bad game...just that there are far better games out there.
1,do not buy, do not waste your money on this! barely stays together. my son lost interest after 5 mins.
1,This is even bigger than I expected. The material is a hard fishnet type of material. I thought it would be softer.
1,Amazon got it here ahead of time as usual	To many small pieces	Brian Cianfrani
1,Ordered this as a gift from "Santa" and it had pieces missing, NO FUN and luckily my daughter didn't question too much.  Just because it's a used game doesn't mean it shouldn't be sold in its entirety.  If a seller can take the time to ship it they should also be able to take the time to make sure it's complete.  Boo.
1,Great idea, not so great execution.  I wanted these to be as amazing as they sounded, sadly they have some flaws.  The stick gets kinda stuck in so you have to pull pretty hard to get it out and if there is any bubble mix left on the stick when you get it out you get like one bubble.  I was hoping this would be a mess free, or close to it,  fun activity for my toddler.  but since she has to pull so hard to get the stick out when it comes out it just flings bubble mix across the room.  For the price of these I was really hoping for better.. I will just get a bubble machine... I only gave it 2 stars because, even though it didn't work well and made a huge mess, my daughter played with it for a quite a long time and really enjoyed pretending like she was blowing bubbles I guess.  hahah.  she is 2.. most things entertain her..
1,Super small. Not worth the money.
1,Junk
1,Too difficult to use.  We had watched videos, but they made it look so easy.  Would not buy this again
1,This is sick. 799????? They cost 39.99. What a joke
1,Sub-par quality item. the front glass is loose i mean very loose. the box is cracked at one end. Seller did not inspect what they shipped out. the only choice i had was to return it for refund and no other options like replacement etc. (let's be honest it is a good item for the price if it's in one peice but who likes paying money for broken gifts). i bought it for a birthday gift for my kid and odered some other items together to receive free shipping. now i am stuck with it. it will cause more waste of time for me to ship it then its worth. SO SAD.. i wish they inspected the items before shipping it to their loyal customers. Never seen a  sub-par item like this being sold here before. they need to step up on quality control. WASTE OF MONEY FOR WHAT I RECEIVED. would have been a good gift for my son if it didn't had a chipped box and loose glass. Buyer's beware: you may get a clean peice when ordering, i think their product quality is not consistent.
1,I removed the clothes from this doll and the parts were not anatomically correct. What a C-Blocker!
1,this is a tiny bottle,took forever to get- arrived leaking and poorly packaged. this is not for regular airbrush
1,Very disappointed, after built, does not look like DeLorean at all. It looks like the car is made of pieces of scraps attached with chopsticks.
1,Horrible... I'm 110 lbs & it wouldn't hold me. It's crap
1,I was disappointed with this item. The bath essentially has to be empty to have any room to connect these pieces. Out of all the bath toys I've bought, the kids lost interest with these the quickest. I somehow thought we could sort of connect them together to drip into each other, even with the bath almost empty, that doesn't work. Plus, the water drips out wherever there is a spinney wheel.
1,Don't waste your money on this junk. Bought it at a local store and had one good day of using it. It is already broken. The bubbles leak from the bottom and no bubbles blow unless I hold it up in the air for some reason. I can't believe how poorly made this is.
1,I purchased this on for two grandchildren and the King Charles Spaniel for another.  All between the ages of 2 and 4.  Each loved it for the first 30 minutes and after a year non that was it they have none on them have played with it since.
1,Product came without pants..jacket seems large and it is!!! I ordered a small but the original cardboard insert says large just has a small sized sticker over it!! Ripoff!!!! I read other reviews should have ordered through another vendor!
1,Broke after first use.
1,While we are using these, they are not well made.  The scale of the wide end does not match up to other, official double track parts.  pins/holes do not line up requiring you to have a few straight pieces in between to allow for the slight difference in width.  Seems like with a few more careful measurements this could have been done correctly, especially considering the significant amount of wiggle in the connecting parts.  Lots of room for error and still come up with a working part.		Not a huge deal, but not a well designed track either.
1,too small for little kids
1,I wouldn't recommend this camera. I hot it for my 3yr old as I do photography as a hobby and he wanted to take pictures in the woods with me. The screen is tiny, it hard to see it or what you are taking a picture of, I did not notice a flash on it which in shaded woods is important, the games can't be disabled and in my opinion don't need to be on there. Also, one of the battery covers popped off the second time it was dropped. This cannot hold up to a child as children drop and throw things. Save your money, it's not worth it. Not even for a 3yr old.
1,Had to return it after 2 hours of use.  Motor burned up
1,Didn't work, but Amazon was nice enough to give me a full refund.
1,its small
1,My 4 year old loved it...but she got it for Christmas, it's March and she doesn't crawl anymore, just makes sounds. She was not rough with her. I don't know what happened, she just stopped working one day. Too bad.
1,I was very disappointed when I open the box. It's a very tiny and if I had another Christmas present for my niece, I would've sent it back.
1,This is a LOT smaller than it appears to be in the photo.	This is a 99 cent item. I gave it two stars because I think that the handle will be sturdy.	I really need to be more careful when l'm sleep-shopping for a trip to the beach.	Signed	Foolio
1,Arrived, assembled and no sound. I put two sets of fresh batteries in it to be sure- there is no input for a power adapter. Both sets of batteries yielded the same results. When the power button was pressed there is a light that would come on and that was it. Fortunately we opened and assembled this before Christmas so we had time to order a different piano. Now we notice that we are not the only ones who have had this problem.
1,I was very disappointed with these magnets! They are not very strong at all. I should have figured as much given the price! Don't waste your money. My grandkids...ranging from 5 to 12 were not interested in these the least little bit. They have almost no magnetability to them. Although it wasn't much, money is money so why buy something that isn't going to be used? Just saying.
1,Some I ordered came with such a low storage charge they couldn't be charged.  Others I got I cant ballance.
1,Very cute and arrived on time but there were only five in the pack, not six as advertised.
1,this is pretty much just a toy it isn't good for actually looking at things in any detail. I don't recommend it.
1,Too many misspelled words. The cards are beautiful but I cant get past it. Someone doesnt know how to spell out numbers.
1,This toy is alright.  I purchased it because my son likes dump trucks and always tries to ride in them so I thought this would be great.  The problem is that when you put the dump back so the child can sit on the seat, there are two black plastic protrusions that serve no purpose and kinda scrape my son's legs when he rides on it.  It looks uncomfortable.  He has to stick his legs out more in order not to scrape against this.  The person who posted about how to change the batteries brought up a good point.  I have no idea how to change the batteries if I need to.  This is an alright toy and you can use the large blocks on it but it's still just meh.  There are better toys out there and I am disappointed in this one.
1,Smaller than i thought.  My 10 months old daughter likes it, but not her favorite toys.  She rarely picks up this toy.
1,don't bother with this thing.  the head came away from the body and we could never get it to snap back in properly.  a total waste of money.
1,Arrived with a manufacturers defect - the characters didn't have the proper key openings on the bottom of each piece which allows the check-up station to speak in each character's voice.  Also it was extremely tiny.  Sent it back and didn't want a new one.
1,THIS IS NOT A JELLYCAT! I got it in the mail from some place in Asia and it is a horrible replication! DO NOT BUY THIS!
1,I ordered this from another website. It had good reviews except one reviewer that complained about it being too small. Well I should have listened. We hold a carving party every year for the kids - it would have been great for last years party when we only had 6 kids but this year we have 19. The cavity of the witch is very small. Candy will only fill her "core" - not her arms, legs or head. So needless to say I'm on the hunt for a bigger pinata one week before the party. Ugh. Otherwise she seems well constructed and she is super cute.
1,I got this on sale for $3.00.  For that price I'd say it is worth it, but I wouldn't pay a penny more.  It is something that belongs in a dollar store. My son likes it and all, but I am very disappointed with the product itself.  The product description said "simulated steam".  Don't fall for it like I did!  Their idea of "simulated steam" is a button that you press on top of the train that pops out a white piece of plastic.  The worst part is that the button gets stuck (and stays stuck).  To the train's defense, my son plays with it - but the quality just doesn't warrant the price in my opinion.  Also, maybe I got a defective one, but it doesn't really fit our take and play sets.  Its size is somewhere between take and play and wooden set....
1,Gimbal seems well made but it will not operate on a Walkera QR350 pro . The power to the controller comes on but it will not level itself.
1,Save your money, buy a Wii.  This doesn't compare in the least and is actually harder for the kids to control than a Wii.  The motion controller is hard to work, the games are dull even for my 3 year old and the graphics are beyond bad.  I thought there was something wrong with our tv when we started using it.  The kids have probably used it 3-4 times since Christmas even though it is set up and available to use at any time and they lose interest in less than 10 minutes.  Seriously not even worth [...].
1,This is one of the most horrible, cheaply made pieces of rubbish I've made the mistake of buying. It takes FOREVER to put together and then it's so shoddy and wonky that it collapses every time you use it. Taking it back to Toys R Us.
1,This is a sloppy toy.  Not a lot of fun, hard to set up, and they don't stay up too well.  I cant think of a reason to buy this thing.
1,This thing is a waste of money, waste of time.  do not recommend.
1,Very said for three reasons:	1. The rear wheels basically won't move when it is pushed forward/backward. One has to click the move button to move the vihicle	2. The doors can't be open	3. The ladder won't hold its' position
1,This is a bean bag plush. If the description would have stated this when I ordered I would not have ordered!
1,So complicated to  build and came cracked after building it
1,You probably had a eureka moment like I did when you saw this product.	But it will not work like how you had imagined it. Far from it.	It's a junk.. Save your money.
1,So I purchased these for my Alien and Predator figures. The Predator figures basically fall over religiously and the Aliens don't have holes in their feet (so very limited posing opportunities). The humans from the line all stand up no problem, but no doubt due to their limited weight. The Predators are all fairly top heavy. The stands would be perfect were they more dense/thick or had actual foot prints to place the figures in.		Overall, I would advise against purchase. They will work some of the time, but aren't worth the money.
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!  Arrived in a small plastic bag, as was expected.  Poorly made of a cheap, clear plastic and the paint jobs were even worse.  Candles from a dollar store are better made then these toys.  Wouldn't put on my grandson's birthday cake, much less let him play with these.  Also, desctiption noted a random mini-figure included but that wasn't there either.  Returned.
1,This looked so cute in the pic. But you have to hold the button down for it to run and it doesn't light up as nice as the pic shows.
1,This toy would be great if it actually works. The buttons stick so bad and my son and I both get really frustrated with it. He loves Mickey Mouse and loves the toy but I'm always having to twist the blue button around to get it unstuck so he can push the button and have mickey pop up. I would definitely invest in a different pop up toy even if your kid loves mickey. Just not worth it
1,They don't look like this at all
1,Arrived broken but I needed it for a party so I kept it. Kids NEVER play with it. Waste of money.
1,Doesn't fit 250 size quads, but advertised as a mini
1,The rocks are smaller than a golf ball and crumbled even when struck with precision and with minimal pressure. After the 5th one turned to dust we gave up and tossed the rest in the junk drawer. A complete waste of money. Wish I had gone with the name brand one. I would rather pay a little more than waste it all!
1,Love the new curvy body, being a person who's loved Barbie for years and has to look for plus size clothing for myself, but I don't know why this one is so popular. Her clothes are tacky and the hair quality of all of the new dolls are greasy looking and messy out of the package, it's disappointing. I hope Mattel makes Made to Move curvy, petite, and tall bodies also.
