0,As a child of the 80s I was pretty into transformers, and while I liked the first Michael Bay film, the franchise headed downhill fast. Sadly, the 80s show has not aged too well either- while it still has all the characters we loved, the animation is pretty inexcusably cheap. Transformers Prime is a great midpoint between the two, possessing all the bombastic action and production values of newer renditions of Transformers, but with the heart (and Peter Cullen and Frank Welker!) of the 80s cartoon.		There are concessions to it being a kids' show. The Autobots are saddled with not fewer than THREE teenage sidekicks, but the focus is rarely on the kids, and wisely remains on the bots. And for a children's program, Prime focuses an awful lo on revenge, torture, and straight up murder; presumable any violence directed at Robots is family friendly. It's not Devil's Due/EDW grim or anything though, and the end result is a surprisingly mature show for kids about robots that turn into cars. The overall mood is somewhat reminiscent of Batman: TAS, another kids' show adults could watch without shame.		This then is probably the best envisioning of Transformers presently available and possibly the best yet, a solid, crisply produced action show with just enough drama to make it a bit more than a glorified toy ad.*		PROS	-Looks really good (except the pilot, which is to be expected)	-Coherent plot arcs reward continuous viewing	-Great mix of new talent and classic TF voice actors		CONS	-It's a cartoon on commercial TV, so the episodes are super short	-Chris Latta is dead, and while Steven Blum does a great Starscream, nobody can truly replace Latta's unique portrayal of sniveling villainy.		*Not that that's a bad thing since if you're a transformers fan you probably want the toys anyway!
0,This was a christmas gift some years ago my son has really enjoyed this...some things are just too funny for words.		If you like comedy and funny jokes and to laugh then you really might enjoy this one.		I maked it I LOVE IT  ,,,due to my son really did		Ok with me I can take it or leave it...
0,Well played and informative on the way it probably was with the Jackie Robinson perspective.  A very seriously and extremely well acted movie. It will have you teary-eyed one minute and cheering the next.
0,It is a fun movie that the whole family can watch and enjoy together. I recommend this movie to all those Dr Suess fans!
0,If there is ever a film acting students must watch, WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? is it. Personally, I had no problem with the DVD. Burton and Taylor are simply marvelous in their roles as two seriously disturbed people who have been married for...much too long. Taylor won an Academy Award and Burton should have won (no disrespect towards Paul Scofield for A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS). Edward Albee's brilliant characters and writing is simply breath-taking. That is if you can take 2 1/2 hours of absorbing drama about four miserable people (George Segal and Sandy Dennis are also excellent as the guests). It is true that a film like this isn't for everyone. The negative reviewers concern themselves with the mood of the film...why would anyone want to watch 4 people yelling at each for over 2 hours...but that isn't a review, and people expecting a Disney version of Albee's play shouldn't be watching it in the first place. Real life isn't easy to watch. Albee's story about an alcoholic professor and his over-bearing alcoholic wife is not easy to watch. Instead, the viewer must watch the film as life-like art, and an example for all filmmakers to follow. Director Mike Nichols had it filmed in black and white (Haskell Wexler), and most of the original play (screenplay by Ernest Lehman) remained intact. In a day when your average movie-going experience involves empty-headed entertainment (Matrix, X-men, Hulk, American Pie, Dumb and Dumberer, etc. - you know what I mean), WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?, even if you need to be in the mood to watch it, is far easier to take in the long run.
0,Great movie and quality
0,Awesome Price and arrived quickly!!  Would buy additional products again!!
0,Great series!
0,The political humor, even though somewhat historic, was very funny!!
0,Good movie
0,I discovered 24 and Jack not that long ago.  I purchased seasons 1-4...I finished 4 about 2 weeks ago and I'm in withdrawl.  I've been trying to watch  5 on TV, but it's not the same because of the commercials and the week wait to get to the next hour.  This series is awesome.  You will be hooked!!
0,The other reviews previously posted pretty well describe the film itself.	It has a very good cast, Rod Taylor is great as the sometimes misunderstood pilot Jack Savage. Glenn Ford is fine as his usual scowling self.	I also enjoyed Wally Cox and Nermiah Persoff's performances as a former crewmate of Savage, and an airline rival of McBain, repectively.	The script gets a bit overblown at times, but it holds-up much better than many similarly-themed films of the era (The High and the Mighty and Ceiling Zero, to name two).	The flashback technique works very well, and is effective in showing you the sides of Savage his detractors missed.		About this product, it has great picture and sound quality. It was a real pleasure to finaly see the film in wide screen.	Extra features are limited to the trailer and isolated audio track, which finally lets you hear Jerry Goldsmith's haunting theme played by piano in the bar scene.	There is also a well-written apreciation of the film included in the well-illustrated DVD case (including some color promotional photos).		Well done to the DVD producers! It was well worth the wait.
0,great
0,Everything came on time and in order. There is a story to get out of this. I like to watch it over.
0,good price-quick delivery-DVD as described-I have not played it yet
0,It look awesome on the show
0,Excellent film!
0,I was very well written and the choice to cast Helen Mirren was perfect.	It showed a perspective of the monarchy which is more human and posed their existence against a21st century political mentality.
0,For those that like the B sci-fi movies this should be right up your alley.  While the movie is totally predictable and the graphics are weak, it is still fun to watch dump people get eaten by giant crocodiles in Maine.
0,I gave 2001 Maniacs 5 star because I liked this movie I rented it and after that I had to own it if you like blood and guts here is a movie you will like
0,As mentioned before, this is a remake of the original series, cut down to fit into a movie, and split into 3 parts. This is part 1, and despite the rush of plot points, manages to pull you in just like the show, at the worst unfortunate time, like the rebuild Evangelion movies!  Those bastards.		Animation in this movie is split into several sections.  The CGI for Objects, mostly weaponry, gives this movie a unique flair.  Swords, Armor, Helmets, Catapults.  It gives the item's it's own Look.  A soldiers helmet and a solider are two distinct things, and it shows.  People and Helmets don't mix in animation, everybody knows this.  Just try showing emotion when face is hidden.  Helmets in real life are just buckets over the head, the person is inside still, the CGI gives that effect, and provides a unique experience.		Problems include your Hero's looking like godly HD Blue-ray level armor with matching high detailed animated money money money detail, with mook's standing around in barely animated suits of low quality dreg.  These low quality extra's should be less....low quality as each new movie comes out, as CGI assets are simpler to carry over, it's like making more of the same movie, instead of starting from scratch.
0,Don't expect to have lot's of extras,but just to have the 1st 3 of the films is a fun time. get it if You still can & then get the others(like I did),then You'll have some of the best zombie films ever!
0,I gave this film 5 stars because the film was cheeky and off-beat and fun entertainment. And so much better than many of the other movies in its sub-genre. There were moments when transitions from scene to scene were too fast, and the aggressive female character controlling Costner's character was a wee bit over the top, but if you like Kevin Costner, and you enjoy Bond-esq type films this one is fun.
0,What Jim Hutton did for Ellery Queen, Timothy Hutton did for Nero Wolfe.  This Wolfe does not go out for strolls or go on about how someone rises from a chair.  Plots are followed extremely well and quite a great deal of the script actually comes from Stout's books.  The only thing I can pick at is they have a set of actors and use them for each story.  Rather disconcerting, but the quality of the series forgives that.  Would recommend this set to anyone who enjoys Rex Stout.
0,Great ballet! Perfect for the Christmas season!
0,I love this series! My box came in all bent sadly. I think it's because the mailman was a lazy ass who didn't want to bring the box to the door and just shoved it in the mailbox but whatever I need to invest in a DVD case anyway due to the amount of tv series I'm buying. But yes, this is quite an amazing tv show!
0,The modern zombie film may have been invented in America, but its real evolution took place in Italy.  While the undead were still shambling around shopping malls in the states, Italian zombies were wielding machine guns (Nightmare City), battling sharks (Zombie) and laying siege to castles with battering rams in copycat quickies like Andrea Bianchi's Burial Ground (1980), a pasty-faced piece of exploitation filmmaking made all the more notorious by a tasteless bit of oedipal violence that still has the power to trigger your gag reflex!		Vacationing at a family estate, a wealthy host and his guests are trapped inside after an archeological dig resurrects the angry remnants of the local peasant population.  But locked doors and barred windows won't keep out this horde of vengeful corpses!  Despite their rotting frames, these zombies use a wide array of tools, weaponry and good 'ol undead ingenuity to break in and extract their pound of raw flesh.		Using Lucio Fulci's Zombie as a template, Burial Ground doesn't even bother with the pretense of character development beyond the mother-son duo of Evelyn (Mariangela Giordano) and Michael (Peter Bark, a 26-year-old actor playing a 13-year-old boy), whose incestuous sexual tension becomes a running gag throughout the film, culminating in the aforementioned shocker of a finale where Michael, now a zombie, bites off his mother's breast!  It's a disgustingly brilliant moment of Italian excess, somewhat reflective of little Karen consuming her parents in the original Night of the Living Dead, but oh-so much more sexually grotesque.		Director Andrea Bianchi was no stranger to mixing sex and death; in fact, it was his cinematic signature in previous over-the-top outings like Strip Nude for Your Killer and Malabimba: The Malicious Whore, all coattail riding genre pictures that pushed things to the extreme.  Burial Ground (aka The Nights of Terror) dutifully arranges the naked flesh for display, and then promptly devours it!  The zombies themselves are rather slipshod in construction, ranging from light make-up work and Halloween masks (keep your eye out for Karloff's likeness) to full-blown applications that look like they were melted in a microwave.  But there's something ridiculously charming about them all the same, especially when Bianchi films them shuffling around the castle grounds in an endless eerie loop.		The gore is your typical "guts in a box," nothing that even comes close to Savini's work on Romero's trilogy...or even the ingenious eyeball puncture in Fulci's film.  Burial Ground leans towards Ossorio's Blind Dead series, relying on the strength in numbers and twisting the rules as needed; there's even a gathering of Knight Templars tossed in just for kicks!  The film's reputation rests mostly on little Michael's big mouth and a couple of humorous typos in the end credits.  So why all the fuss?  Italian horror doesn't make sense, and neither does the appeal for the uninitiated.  There are plenty of zombie flicks out there; feel free to enjoy their convincing special effects and professional acting...this one is ours!		And Severin Films is a perfect fit for Burial Ground's hi-def debut.  The self-described "Criterion of Smut" has put together an incredible special edition that starts with a stellar new 2K restoration of the film itself, looking consistently amazing all the way through.  Extras include a fascinating tour of the shooting location (which has been a hot spot since the early days of Italian Gothics), festival Q & A with actor Peter Bark, sit-down interview with actors Simone Mattioli and Mariangela Giordano and producer Gabriele Crisanti, plus deleted / extended scenes and a theatrical trailer.
0,good movie

0,Here is what I call a movie. It has everything,a terrific plot,fine dialogue,and the smooth talking menace of Mr Claude Rains. Who could ask for more?
0,Loved it
0,Fine film, rather slow but a good regift once viewed. Technically good.
0,Really enjoyed the Martian, first in the theatre and then at home.  Really pleased with the movie after having loved the book.
0,I'm a huge collector of anime. I started to read the manga a few years ago and got hooked. Unfortunately Suncoast went under years ago, so I couldn't buy the discs from them. Our blockbuster also went under, so I couldn't go and see if they had it for cheap, and everywhere else that I looked would've charged $29.99/disc--providing that they even had individual and not box-set of it... Finally came on here and was able to find them used, at a relatively cheap price--probably paid less for these discs than if I had gone out to buy a new disc or box set of it (starting at $29.99/disc, probably closer to a little over $100 for the boxset...). Very pleased with it since it runs like a charm and isn't too beaten up (doesn't skip, unlike some other discs I've gotten from sellers).
0,this movie is amazing. keeps you intrested and you want to watch it to the end. jason statham is always good, but this movie is very under-rated.
0,Great series , highly recommended
0,In my opinion, Ledger's best movie. A psychological thriller ... I love it!
0,Intelligent story line.  The lead male and most of the others aren't terrible actors.  Make up is good.  Nice surround sound.  I like it very much!!!
0,There's no question that director dm Csszi's film looks stunning, and benefits from some attractive leads, but this isn't the "hot three-way love story" Amazon's product description promises (although a hot threeway does feature). It's primarily a film about homophobia, and homophobic violence, and (spoiler alert) it doesn't end well.		There's some discussion in the other reviews for this film about anti-gay violence and unhappy endings, much of which I agree with. All too often it feels like the easy option for filmmakers, the sudden, violent death of the protagonist. It's a tactic I'm fed up with too. No one's asking for a happy ever after ending, but does it always have to end with the bloody slaying of the gay guy? It isn't shocking, you just think, "Gee, I didn't see that coming."		Climax aside, "Land of Storms" is well worth seeing. Enjoy the trip, but don't be surprised by the dark clouds rolling in...
0,Movie of the year
0,really great i liked the movie the concept actors everything was reall great me an the grandkids had a good time watching the movie thanks
0,Love this. I come back to it time and time again to revamp my sexual feminine energy and practice the art of using our eyes to be coquettish. A good practice of sensuality to slow down all of our magickal sexuality into a slow offering to our beloved, to our selves.
0,Loved this movie from the Rough Riders Buck Jones, Tim McCoy and Raymond Hatton, the interaction between the stars are what makes this and the other Rough Rider movies great
0,Many persons write and ask if this DVD has subtitles, closed captions or has Spanish dubbing. I am writing to inform every buyer the following things that I have learned after I bought this DVD	1-This series has NO SUBTITLES NOR IS CLOSED-CAPTIONED.	2-The spoken language is ENGLISH and no one else.	3-The actors, as everyone is aware are ALL BRITISH, so the english spoken is the BRITISH ENGLISH, very pleasant to the ear of the persons who are habituated to it, but not for everyone.	4-Many times I had to rewind and hear again what the actors were saying because the plot is so full of subtleties that if you lose a phrase or even a word you may not understand what is happening.	5-Pay attention to the names and if you are interested, anote them. They are German, Russian, French and other different names that you may not recognized at once. A tip: In the end of each episode, the names are displayed with the name of the actor that played the role. The nicknames also are hard to get: Nicky is Nicholas, the Tzar, Willy is Willhem II, the Kaiser, Vicky is the mother of the Kaiser, Alex is the Tzarina, and so on. Pay attention because they are all cousins and they call each other by their nicknames!	Well, these are the drawbacks. If you love a really good series about the 19th century that is one of the best I have ever seen. Even seeing the same episode (there are 13!) twice to understand the plot, I have enjoyed immensely the series. Patrick Stewart as Lenin is unforgettable. The other names of the cast are unknown but magnificent! I would say: Buy this series. Be patient. Hear carefully and rewind if necessary. It is worthwhile. But BBC COULD release this masterpiece at least with closed captions as they did with Henry the Eight and Elizabeth R, other superb series that EVERYONE SHOULD SEE.	Deniza Futuro-Brazil
0,Don't let the fact that the documentary "William Kunstler: Disturbing the Universe" was produced, written and directed by his two daughters, Emily and Sarah, lead you to assume that this is just some reflexive puff-piece on the man and his life.  Indeed, with a scrupulous desire for balance and fairness, the filmmakers acknowledge the controversial nature of their father and his work, while at the same time evincing the love and affection any daughters would feel for a devoted parent.  In fact, they even admit that, as youngsters, the sisters often disagreed with the types of cases he was willing to take on and the types of people he was willing to defend (gang-rapists, assassins, Islamic terrorists), and often lived in fear for their own safety due to those choices.  But with maturity comes the longer view, and now the Kunstler girls are able to appreciate more fully their father`s unwavering belief that true justice can be achieved only when it applies to everyone equally - those we love and admire as well as those we hate and fear.		Kunstler was, of course, the civil rights attorney who became a household name when he served as lead counsel for the Chicago 7 in the late 1960s, an act for which he served several months in prison on charges of "contempt of court," a sentence that was later overturned.  But it was this trial - and the obviously unjust way in which the defendants were treated (especially Bobby Seale) - that forever "radicalized" Kunstler, making him see the American legal system as a racist machine hell bent on discriminating against minorities and the poor and those who lacked favor in the eyes of society.  After this crucial turning point, Kunstler dedicated his life and his career as a defense attorney to full-time anti-war and civil rights activism, which garnered him the near-constant attention of an ever-suspicious FBI.  Kunstler was actively involved in trying to bring peaceful resolutions to the famous standoffs at Attica (where he clearly did not succeed) and Wounded Knee (where he did).		It was in the second half of his career, when, in his capacity as a criminal defense attorney for the city of New York, he began defending some pretty loathsome characters - he is even shown physically embracing John Gotti - that many of his former supporters, including his daughters, began to question his moral convictions.  But Kunstler, who died in 1995, always maintained that every person accused of a crime was entitled to a vigorous defense, and it is this philosophy that ultimately won over many of his critics and even his daughters in the end.		A mixture of file footage and interviews with numerous people who both knew Kunstler personally or were deeply affected by his work, the documentary itself is fairly conventional in style and form, but its portrait of a man who insisted, often at great personal risk to himself and his family, that all people be given a fair trial - and of his daughters' growing understanding and eventual acceptance of what he was all about - makes it truly inspiring.

0,4 Stars = Classic		"Stake Land" plays like an apocalyptic Zombie film with Vampires instead. That being said, the Vampires in this film are but Zombies with Vampire physical traits, & even that is minimal, with no supernatural shape shifting abilities, though their make up is effectively feral in appearance. Their mental capacity is about Zombie level, though they have evolved in to two types of Vampires, with one stronger & harder to kill than the other. It appears they may be evolving more, which is an interesting idea, but it is a thin line to hang a whole film on. Now most of what I've wrote so far, really doesn't sound to interesting, or original, but this is only one aspect of the plot...		"Stake Land" is a chameleon. Yes, it's an apocalyptic Zombie like, Vampire film, but it's also plays out like a western, especially a bounty hunter western. It is a road movie. It is a film that makes statements about how the human race will become fragmented, becoming just as much of a menace to it's self as the Vampires are, with fanatical religious groups, in this case extremist Christians, taking the appearance of Vampires as a sign of God's wrath, & feeding the non-believers to the Vampires as a sacrifice to God. It also taps into the male domination of women through religion, though it takes this premise to extremes, it is also conceivable that these things could & would happen with religious male extremists. So here's a little more fuel to the fire. Still, it's been done before, though...		The thing that makes "Stake Land" a great little film as opposed to a mediocre been there, done that film, is it's great acting, script, direction, & personal characters plot line interaction. Yes, this is an apocalyptic film, but seen at the very personal level of two characters, teenager "Martin," whose family was destroyed by Vampires, & "Mister," ( who reminds me of the Troll Hunter in "Troll Hunter") who saves his life & teaches him to be a Vampire hunter. There is a real relationship here, as "Mister" becomes a surrogate father figure to Martin, & as gruff & grizzled as Mister is, there are moments that shows his love of Martin, like a son. The two go on their journey meeting & helping other people, actually building strong relationships with these people, who are struggling against the Vampires & the religious extremists. These relationships are quite real, & touching. You get to know these characters. You get to care about these characters, & that is this film's saving grace, even though as preposterous a setting as Vampires taking over the world is, "Stake Land" remains a very human film, about human relationships, with all the love & hate that goes with human relationships. This makes "Stake Land" much deeper than most of it's sub-genre ilk. In a way, this makes "Stake Land" the Vampire equivalent to ""28 Days Later" & "28 Weeks Later." It gives you people to care about as those films did. It is no where as groundbreaking as those films, but in the end, it's those little everyday relationships we have, that make life & this movie, worth while.
0,It's Penn & Teller, ether you love them or hate them...... no middle ground
0,great buy for 3 movies, but will never watch the Wild bunch not my cup of tea
0,Captures a part of ancient history not often seen. The ending is rather violent for my taste, but illustrative of the period.
0,Great series.
0,Phenomenal film.  It grants that America has its faults (and honestly identifies them) but goes the extra step in examining those faults in the greater context of world, specifically in cultures past and present.  Imagining the world without the footprint of America and her ideological charge toward liberty is truly eye-opening.  It should be mandatory viewing for anyone prone to criticize this country... and any high school civics class... if our country would actually implement those :/
0,I own this series because of GM and her Marple is sublime and well paced. More doddering and which makes her seem more plausible as the Old Lady they should ignore. I love the ones with Julie Mckenzie as well. She is a very fine actor but for some reason these are so very dear to my heart I watch them over and over again and they calm down. Who every thought MURDER would lulls me to sleep....
0,good movie!
0,The Count of Monte Cristo is one of my favorite books of all time so I was hesitant to see it translated on film.  I purchased this version as opposed to the newer/American one, because I thought a French production would lend a certain authenticity to it.  Not surprisingly, the dvd leaves parts of the story out; that's the harsh reality of translating a book into film.  There were a few cheesy images--like a small boat surrounded by whipping waves but the boat didn't really move.  Oh well. It's not perfect. But it is VERY good.  I would rather rationalize a large Gerard Depardieu as a starved prisoner than watch a version that purports to condense a fabulous story like this one into a two hour movie.  Very well acted and I highly recommend.
0,Nice cases great cartoons.
0,Great
0,Based on the book series, the film did Odd justice. I was surprise this did not get more theater time, it is certainly one of the better movies made this year. The book series is a wonderful page turner. Anton Yelchin was wonderful as Odd. I hope he makes a sequel as I loved "seeing" Odd portrayed. If you are not familiar with the books, I would read it before you watch the movie.	Quirky and adorable, Odd Thomas is that mix of supernatural, sci-fi and love story that makes the genre worth following. So to the powers who be, loop us in, and make more Odd films.
0,One of the most beautifully shot films in cinematic history!!! and a must see in HD even if you've seen it before on regular DVD. The images are sharp and clearer than ever. Kubrick found this unique camera lenses to shoot in natural light. All costumes are real antiques!!! It's really like going back in time to the 18th century!! Although to many the story is slow and a little boring but the film is beautiful in captures you all the way through!!! The pace in my opinion is captured perfect. Let's face time was a lot slower back then. One of my favorite pictures of Kubrick - I would say definitely 2nd to 2001 A Space Odyssey!!
0,This is a quick review of the Blu-ray version.  As for the movie itself, I consider it a five star movie. It is one of those classics that you can sit through time and time again and, I believe at one point, Playboy rated this the ultimate number one "guy" movie while placing Gone with the Wind as the ultimate number one "gal" movie.		This Blu-ray version is the first version I have ever seen of an older movie that gets five stars for the transfer to Blu-ray.  I was shocked when I fired up the Blu-ray player and threw this DVD in.  The transfer is flawless.  The detail is amazing and is the best transfer of any movie I have ever seen.  I can not emphasize enough the quality of this transfer.  If you are hesitating the purchase because you are unsure the cost will be worth the quality, whip out that credit card because you are in for a wonderful experience.		This begs the question "Why aren't all transfers to Blu-ray this good?"  I don't know but this certainly sets the standard high.  Again, I am shocked and absolutely couldn't be happier with this Blu-ray version.  There are a couple of other perks with this purchase like the "making of" and interviews with the actors but, for me, it's all about the quality of the transfer and it is the best I have ever seen.		If you like this movie, you have got to purchase this Blu-ray.  You will not be disappointed.
0,Lots of people getting killed in sadistic ways. It's actually a pretty sick and messed up movie. It's over the top and pretty much the blueprint for a comedic slasher movie. If you know what you're getting into and like this sort of movie it's pretty entertaining. But it's not a serious slasher or horror movie. Take it for what it is and it's a lot of fun. If you don't want to see people getting senselessly murdered in terrible ways skip this one. It does have that 80's charm to it. 4/5.
0,This was a good, solid suspensful movie. you can always count on Morgan Freeman to turn out a solid performance in a good plot. Ashley Judd was wonderful as well.
0,this movie will make you a better American.....I will see it more and more
0,When you go to the video store looking for films with positive role models for kids (and adults!), with an inspirational message that you can accomplish something if you put your mind to it, you typically will find almost nothing.  Worse, even movies with a fraction of a positive message will be so silly or idiotic that watching them as an adult is torture.  With "Whale Rider" you get a movie that adults and teens (and many pre-teens) can both watch and enjoy.		As Roger Ebert pointed out in his review of "Whale Rider," something is horribly wrong with a ratings system that gives a movie like this a PG-13 rating.  Just watch this next to a movie like "Dodgeball" with its objectification of women, toilet humor and sexual innuendo.  Both movies have the same rating!  Don't be fooled.  The average 12 year old _should_ be watching "Whale Rider" while "Dodgeball" shouldn't be viewed even by 14 year olds.  All of this has me wondering about about the sanity and intelligence of the ratings board.		As many have pointed out, Keisha Castle-Hughes puts in a superb performance.  Ditto for the rest of the cast.		Perhaps even better than the performances are the positive roles played by most characters.  The kids are intelligent, confident and curious.  The adults are generally supportive and wise.  While the males in the movie have obvious faults, this movie is about them as it is about "girl power."  There's a scene where Keisha's character is riding a bike with her grandfather and a loving glance passes between them.  How rare it is to see such imagery - a father figure bonding with a child - in movies or TV!  "Whale Rider" isn't just about celebrating a girl's empowerment.  It's also about showing the love between male parental figures and their own personal growth as their children mature.		One caveat: "Whale Rider" is not typical Hollywood popcorn fare.  Viewers with short attention spans or those who hate all foreign film style films will likely not like this movie.  Still, "Whale Rider" is an excellent start to open the eyes of a youth (or an adult) to ideas outside of what the studies usually throw at us.		Bottom line: We'd all be better off if we had more movies like this.
0,Excellent Christmas movies.  The Most Wonderful Time of the Year was great!  Good movie, funny, just a good movie. The other two were also good, but would recommend the movie mentioned above.
0,Great screwball movie
0,I enjoy historical pieces including those that are not historically accurate.  However, that say, the historical inaccuracies drive me crazy and this movie is no exception.  Cinematography is appealing but the audio track gives the impression it was overlayed to the video after the video was shot.  This gives a distracting (not in a good way) element to the audio.
0,The kind of movie you think about for several days.  I would enhoy watching it again.  But it's probably a chik flick.
0,I love this show, sorry it's over.  The packages are perfect,  The DVD layout give you options of PLAY ALL or individually, each chapter on the individually selected option gives a summary, and language / setup options.  Totally satisfied, Season 7 and the Sam Ash DVD are separate,but worth it to complete the series.  As a former special forces soldier, I enjoyed re-visiting some of the devices shown here in these DVD"s.
0,I really enjoyed this movie.  Great actors/actresses added to the story.  Regina King was excellent as always.  This movie had a lot of well known stars.  Usually, when there are a many heavy hitters, the movie isn't as good as it is promoted.  Not in this case.  The movie was great from beginning to end.  It showed a a loving family with loving drama.  Even with the drama and or secret, the end result was love and support.
0,Beautifully done!!
0,Good
0,Love this show, but like with many TV series it didn't continue and fell short of a fantastic future. Season two was the last. I believe if it was up to the many fans of this show and shows like The Dresden Files, Terra Nova and many other incomplete TV series an ending would resolve the craving for more.  At least give us a conclusion like you did with FarScape with  The PeaceKeeper Wars to bring closure to some great TV series.
0,Great
0,Keeps getting funnier!!
0,Bought for my sister as a gift.  She always tries to take mine when visiting.  This is a true Disney classic for me--although I could do away with the show the dishes/silverware put on  I would recommend this for anytime and any age.
0,these guys are one of my favorites, love it

0,Downfall impressed me greatly on a number of different levels.  It can't be easy to make a movie showing your country's destruction and acknowledging the atrocities your own countrymen committed.  The fact that Germany won't allow publication or importing of Mein Kampf even as an historical document has always suggested to me a national desire to just pretend the events of the past never happened.  For obvious reasons, I was exceedingly interested in watching this film.  How would Hitler be portrayed?  Would there be any mention of the Holocaust?  I had these and many other questions.  All those questions were answered with a surprisingly nuanced film of great complexity and depth.		Downfall chronicles not only Hitler's last days inside the bunker but the immediate aftermath of his death and Germany's surrender.  To a significant degree, that story is reflected through the eyes of Traudl Junge, one of Hitler's personal secretaries.  Video clips of an interview with the elderly Junge from Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary (2002) frame the presentation (ringing rather hollow, if you ask me - but that's really neither here nor there).  In the claustrophobic confines of Hitler's bunker, we witness the final days of the already broken Fuhrer, the individual dramas of those in Hitler's inner circle as they wrestle with the decision to leave or stay, and the total destruction of German society along with National Socialism.		The treatment of Hitler is, to my mind, exceedingly well done.  Hitler was a much more complicated man than many give him credit for.  His personal demons came to consume him, but there was a human side to the man, as well - and this film brings that out in a very nuanced way.  This is not to say that Downfall makes of Hitler a sympathetic character - not in the slightest.  His hate and venom are never far from the forefront, but this actually stands to reinforce his exceedingly human weaknesses.  His mood swings are severe, especially as the end draws near - and he's not always rational.  Betrayal drives him into a fury, especially the ultimate betrayal by Himmler.  Yet he remains lucid enough to plan his death in an effort to keep his remains out of the hands of the Russians.		Almost as fascinating as Hitler himself, in both history as well as this film, are the Goebbels.  Joseph Goebbels himself remained loyal to the very end, and it can be said that his wife Magda was even more dedicated to Hitler and National Socialism than he was.  She, after all, killed all six of her children rather than let them grow up in a world without National Socialism - and that scene proves to be the most riveting of the entire film.  Eva Braun is an almost extraordinary character in the film; maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think the filmmakers gave an accurate picture of her at all.		Then there are the military leaders who watch Hitler give orders their decimated armies cannot possibly follow.  Loyalty is a powerful force in these men's lives - but their loyalty is to Germany rather than Hitler himself.  For this reason, they are the ones asking Hitler to spare the German people and to think about ending the war.  For some, though, the distaste of Germany's surrender from World War I overrides everything else in their determination to fight to the death - and I think that was a most telling point for the film to make.  The only real problem I had with the film was the fact that I was hard pressed to identify several of the most prominent characters.  All of the actors were made to resemble the men they played, but - even though I'm familiar with most of the historical figures - I really couldn't figure out the identities of several characters over the course of the film.		You may be wondering if the film actually shows Hitler's suicide on the screen - I wondered that myself.  Unfortunately, I'm not going to tell you how the scene plays out.  You will find a significant number of fairly graphic scenes in the film, though.  It truly is a realistic presentation of Germany's darkest days, with the increasingly devastating destruction of Berlin going hand in hand with the physical and mental breakdown of the man ultimately responsible for it all.  Honestly, I never expected any German filmmaker to produce such an honest, complex, awe-inspiring motion picture about their most infamous national leader.  Downfall is a must-see.
0,I absolutely love this movie. I went to go see it in the theater the first day it went in and I'm glad I went to see it. I would have missed out on one of the absolute best animated movies I've ever seen. I love every character, every song and I love the new villain. Everything about this movie was great for me. from the characters to the songs to the story to EVERYTHING! I think this movie was rated very unfairly and is an underrated masterpiece. Toto is honestly my favorite due to him being so darn cute and adorable. Even though he can't speak, his facial expressions and movements say it all. This is one of my absolute favorite animated films though. I do love the original 1939 film as well but I love cartoons and animation so I like this one so much more. it was easier for me to get into. I recommend it for everybody. please give this movie a chance. it is very wonderful =)
0,Surprisingly funny. I really loved the first season and can't wait for the second season. Gary is the best character.
0,I heard good things about this show, so,far I haven't been disappointed!
0,Thank you
0,THE ONLY WAY TO HAVE ALL THE EPISODES!!! ENJOYED!!!
0,Good movie
0,Very happy wiyh amazon prime.
0,Loved it!!
0,He just gets better and better.  The film was a little gory in places, but all in all a fun film.  I also like the fact that Amazon had this movie on Prime.
0,GREAT SEQUEL TO THE ORIGINAL
0,one of the best series of all time. loved everything about it. couldn't wait to see the next episode, however the last season they had for pay. so i had to wait to see.
0,Finally, a Clint Eastwood movie that does not belong to the Dirty Harry category. It's a tough story, with some tragic consequences. But it is a transformational process of a tough man who seems so hard to reach, so fixated in his beliefs and prejudices, and yet, I can't tell you the rest, you need to see it to find out more. The 1972 gran Torino was splendid, and the dog was very lovable...
0,good story about how foolish yet persistent existence is in the face of nuclear disaster
0,ok story line
0,Need more episodes!
0,Great movie. I love re-watching it but can't stand Fredric March. The other actors were great.
0,THIS MOVIE IS GOOD LOVE IT
0,Even law enforcement agents are not above the law, although their brethren find it hard to believe and band together to protect the guilty. Eventually, they all get caught and get what they deserve.
0,This series has lost none of its punch through the 3rd season.  You have to pay attention to the numerous story lines going on that will continually hold your attention.  Costumes and location are great and it provides good humor as well.  Looking forward to the 4th season.
0,What a great concert.  Everyone is so on.  Its great to see them jam like that.  Dan De Leo is the bomb. Incredible player, incredible live sound. no regrets.
0,Very interesting look at poverty in the US. It doesn't offer much resolution. It be nice to hear an update on the people involved.
0,Makes me wonder...Very inspiring...
0,The story line and the acting are superb...far better than American crime dramas that have too much fluff...
0,Finally after six years I know what every one is talking about.  This is a cute little story of a wanna be World's Greatest Villain who meets his match when he adopts 3 little girls that steal his heart.  Both of my kids who are 3 and 2 sat through this movie and there was no Olaf or Elsa to keep them entertained. They laughed out laud several times and so did I. I loved the minions and the adult humor, that is just for mom, dad, aunt or uncle is forced to watch the movie.  This is a cute family movie that I am positive I will see over and over again.
0,The Detective was one of Frank Sinatra's best movies. Tough as nails as always, determined, honest, and principled, Sinatra plays a New York City homicide investigator who is looking into a murder of a gay man. His investigation leads him into police corruption and conspiracy.		Sinatra gives a great performance, and the film may be somewaht dated, but presents gay characters that are not stereotypical. Lee Remick plays his wife, from whom he's separated, and gives her typical solid performance. Other great supporting performers include Jack Klugman, Ralph Meeker, Lloyd Bochner, and Tony Musante.		The Detective is definitely a worthwhile film for Sinatra fans, and for those who enjoy a nice, well-acted thriller.
0,Really good movie from stat to end action pack all the way
0,Great Bermuda Horror!!!
0,Of course we needed this one for the collection as well. Now our collection is complete. We bought this movie used as well. Another great bargain. We love this movie too and watch it all the time as well.
0,Solid show - didn't hold my attention for too long, but I think it would still make great education for the just-hit-double-digits-aged kids of this generation.
0,This is just a great movie for the familly.  It's a little on the schmaltzy side but it's not too violent for the younger kids.
0,Decent storyline about who will stand up to corporate interest and protect the little people. Well acted and good hiding of the real motive. Star Trek Next Generation fans -this one's for you!
0,good book

0,We recently discovered this show on PBS and we just can't get enough Doc.  This set enabled us to go back to the beginning and catch up on all the seasons we missed plus season 5 which isn't airing where we are.  Now I have Season 6 on pre-order and we can't wait to get it.  Love, love, love this show!  The writers and actors are brilliant!  The movies included were an interesting bonus as well.
0,Just as described
0,The plot was probably hackneyed back in 1927 - A childless, wealthy old man dies.  Twenty years later his will is to be read.  Relatives gather at his cobweb encrusted, dark and spooky old mansion.  One envelope will be opened naming the relative, a second envelope is to be opened only in the event the first heir is found to be insane.  Oh, yeah, and the night is dark and stormy and the old man's ghost is said to prowl about the drafty halls.  For some reason, everyone has to spend the night.  Hackneyed then, moth-eaten now, this story has been told and retold and parodied for 80 years.		  The silent THE CAT AND THE CANARY (1927) is a comedy-thriller, although the thrill-meter doesn't often move off zero, and when it does it doesn't move far.  The comedy depends in large part on a scared audience for tension-relieving laughter.  For a thriller-comedy that I didn't find much scary or funny, I enjoyed the heck out of this movie.		  German migr Paul Leni directed this visually stunning movie.  If the story itself was stale Leni redeemed it by pulling so many tricks out of his seemingly limitless repertoire and utilizing an uncanny sense of when to use what for greatest effect.  There are double and sometimes triple exposures, weird camera angles and character lighting, deep fields, narrow fields, claustrophobically tight close-ups.  You name it, Leni used it at the right time to achieve the right effect.  For instance, the character who is named first heir has to prove she is sane - a Dr. Caligari type alienist will arrive later.  There's a chance that the alternate heir is known, and none of the others can be trusted.  The heir is likened to old Cyrus West, who we see in the opening scene of the movie in a triple-exposed scene layering film of the old man languishing in a wheelchair, a screen full of medicine bottles, and glowering over it all is a trio of hissing cats, swiping sharps claws at the helpless old man.  The old man is the canary.  Later, after the will is read, the named heir is taken to a study by the lawyer, and the camera photographs her from behind a row of wooden chairs - the slats of which surround her, so she too looks like a golden-haired canary in a wooden cage. This is one of those rare, shining movies where seemingly every shot counts, and adds another layer of meaning to the story.		  Material enclosed with this dvd says Leni was in line to direct Universal's Dracula, but died of blood poisoning at the age of 44 in 1929, two years before Dracula was released.  It would have been interesting to see what this master director would done with the material.		  Also included on the Image dvd is a Hal Roach directed Harold Lloyd two-reeler, HAUNTED SPOOKS.  This slapstick silent IS funny, and like THE CAT AND THE CANARY the transfer print was in good to very good condition.  Overall recommended, primarily for a chance to see an example of a Paul Leni directed movie.
0,To say anything negative about this movie due to it's cast or it's predecessors is a wasteful shame.  No parent can hear these same messages too many times, too many ways, or by too many A - Z list actors.  If there are children in your life that you love, pay the $4 and get the messages this film was intended to give.  It's not a blockbuster, a grammy winner, or even likely to make it in any one person's top 100 all time favorite movie lists - it's a portrait of extremes meant to blatantly remind of you how increasingly complicated life becomes with forever evolving technology taking center stage.
0,I heard alot of different things about the movie but when I finally saw it I was laughing so hard, it was so funny and I'm glad I bought it.
0,When I first heard they were making a movie about the Guardians of the Galaxy, I had extremely low expectations. The Guardians are not exactly A-list Marvel characters. Not even B-List. Very obscure D-list heroes from the 1980s. The only one of the group I had even heard of was Rocket Raccoon. I therefore immediately dismissed the title as pure desperation on Marvel's part, to dig down so deep for new material.	I ignored the movie during its theatrical run. I gave it one week, two at most before oblivion. I was amazed when the movie stayed on and on and on.	Then after it finally closed I never gave it another thought.	On a whim I recently decided to rent it. I figured, if it sucks as bad as I think it will, I will only be out three bucks. I was very pleasantly surprised; decent acting for a superhero flick, and incredible effects. The two scene stealers are of course Rocket and Groot, the most unlikely team ever.	I was also surprised to see old Jack Kirby characters like Ronan the Accuser and Thanos in the movie. The only thing I disliked was the casting of "Yondu". I don't dislike the actor, but for me he will be forever typecast as Merle Dixon from the Walking Dead. And this was basically Merle Dixon in blueface. Overall though, I enjoyed the movie, and even ended up buying it. Looking forward to the sequel (s)..
0,This is an interesting movie of three nice and decent people whose settled inter-relationship in one stage of life is suddenly and unexpectedly threatened in another stage. Many of us are lucky enough to make lasting friendships in school; sadly for one reason or another (relocation, different colleges, varying careers), many of these friendships fade away.	This is a story of two boys and a girl whose friendship as children was as good as it could get. Now years later, the boys are into religion: one (Norton) an ordained Catholic priest working with youth, the other (Stiller) a Jewish rabbi auditioning for a congregation. Meanwhile, in a nice little twist, the girl (Elfman) has become a high powered businesswoman. The movie explores what happens when they meet again. The friendship is every bit as good as it used to be  the days seem hardly to have passed. But as adults, they have new priorities, new ambitions that complicate the picture. Happy as Norton is with his vocation, Elfman awakens questions in him (of relationships, of marriage, of sex) that he thought were settled, but in fact has no answers for. Stiller has other problems with his evident attraction to Elfman and hers for him. A rabbi unlike a priest is free (in fact almost expected!) to marry; yet marriage to a girl who is not Jewish (she is catholic) would jeopardize his ambition to be rabbi of an influential congregation where he can make a difference. Both Norton and Stiller are simultaneously battling conservative elders to draw more youth to their respective services. Elfman herself seems to be weighing career and family options. These are no perfect cut-outs; they are basically decent people with human flaws. Faced with choices that impact their fundamental beliefs, they struggle, make mistakes, hurt themselves and each other. The ending may be predictable, but they way Norton (who also directs) gets to the end is top quality. The film is filled with vignettes of humor. It does not preach but tries to understand the terrible conflicts that arise when worlds collide. I enjoyed the movie and before I end, let me recommend the bonus scene on the DVD of Anna and the vibrating cell phone (I will not say more lest I spoil it for you) which is hilarious.

0,Just when I think Season 1 was fantastic, Season 2 becomes my favorite.  I love this series.  I've seen the entire thing and every season is great.  My favorite character is Jack Bristow.  Victor Garber is one of my favorite actors. Great series.  You won't be disappointed.
0,Perhaps the bestwestern series EVER to come to tv or Hollywood. Ther was no better cast ever in a tv series. What can you say about Jack Elam, oneof the best charactor actors in the business. I thought Larry Ward did a fantastic job keeping the guys within the law which as we saw was not easy,props to Warner Bros. Fordoing their best to keep it Real. Please find and show the much talked about 20th episode. That would be most fitting for one, No the best western ever...If there are any of the cast still alive i want to thank you. All of you were SPECTACULAR!!!!!
0,Always a thriller!! Great actors, the best and worst of human nature! Hopefully mature audiences only....
0,Brilliantly done! Graphic in every sense of the word and done with a touch of Spagetti Western. Definitely a must see.
0,David Milch's profane masterpiece, "Deadwood," continues to demonstrate that HBO has mastered the art of the TV series.  Bloody, sexy, funny and sad, Season Two offers plenty of surprises for fans still thunderstruck from Season One.		Season Two opens about seven months or so after the close of the first season.  Sheriff Bullock (Tim Olyphant) and saloon-owner/prime mover-and-shaker Al Swearengen (Ian McShane) have settled into an uneasy alliance, but one as fragile and explosive as nitroglycerine.  A harsh look and some brash talk set these two at their throats in the very first episode.  It's no secret that Bullock's nerves are shot, as his affair with Alma Garrett (Molly Parker) is about to be terminated by the imminent arrival of his wife (Anna Gunn).		The various sub-plots of the camp continue to roil and seethe.  The continued prosperity of the camp has attracted the eyes of the outside world.  Montana and Dakota are jockeying to annex the camp for statehood, and Swearengen and Cy Tolliver (Powers Boothe) try to work the necessary angles to make sure they won't get lost in the shuffle.  George Hearst, the most successful and ruthless gold miner in the West, has sent his representative to scout out the town and use ruthless methods to acquire mining claims . . . and this representative is a "specialist" with the local prostitutes.  Trixie and Sol Starr continue their "relationship."  Doc continues his lonely war for the virtue of the camp.  There is even a battle for the alleys and shanties of the Chinese community in town. And Calamity Jane continues her struggles with the bottle and the death of her friend, Wild Bill Hickock.		This series is far to vast to be adequately summarized here.  Suffice it to say that "Deadwood" continues to offer some of the most colorful and insightful writing on TV, and the cast does an excellent job capturing the essence of frontier life in 19th century America in all its varied forms.		Several cast commentaries highlight various aspects of the show, including the actors' collective ignorance as to what is going on.  Aaron Sorkin was notorious for providing scripts to his actors that were still warm from the printer - David Milch does much the same here, but his scripts are much more complex and subtle.  There is also a great DVD extra showing how hard Milch actually works writing this stuff, lying on the floor reworking line after line of dialogue until it is just right.		If you haven't seen the show yet, get Season One immediately.  Then I won't have to convince you to watch Season Two.
0,wife loves this
0,Fan of Adam Carolla? Fan of sports movies with a Rom-Com twist? Or just looking for a good movie? Well, how about all three? That's what you get with this film. I've watched this with multiple friends, make & female. They weren't boxing fans or were unfamiliar with Adam. But they all loved it. It still has a Certified Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. So you can't go wrong here! Enjoy!
0,Was ok, good performances by all.
0,The show is like Seinfeld on herion. It's VERY dark but funny. If you liked the premise of Seinfeld you'll love this show.
0,Awesome!

0,This movie has held up very well over the years. The actors, the acting and the rich, elaborate settings are really worth it. The story line was translated very well from the original German book of old, via the black-and-white Parent Trap movie from 1961 to this more modern version. My family enjoyed this movie immensely.

0,Just as thought-provoking, clever, and humorous as his previous documentaries, Michael Moore's Capitalism: A Love Story turns its disapproving eye to the title economic system and its disastrous effects on people across America. As the film progresses and we're shown numerous examples of families thrown out of their houses, factory workers laid off without warning, and taxpayers shelling out billions to bail out banks, it becomes apparent that capitalism itself isn't to blame, but rather the avaricious few who abuse the policies and corrupt those in power. As it exposes the guilty further lining their pockets, it also offers plenty of hope, emphasizing the minor and major rebellions that prove that change is just around the corner. And for many frightened CEO's, so is Michael Moore, with his intimidating microphone and a demand for answers.		No stranger to tackling the big issues, documentarian Michael Moore takes on capitalism and the reasons behind America's recent economic "meltdown". Beginning in Rome and bringing us up to date with the recession, the purported evils of capitalism are compared to everything from vultures to Vegas casinos, and its negative impact blamed for death profiteering, predatorial bank lending, and the eventual downfall of democracy. But with the depressing realizations of a good system gone wrong, Moore invokes his trademark brand of clever humor, creative editing, and a little grandstanding pizzazz.		Michael Moore has reached a point of notoriousness that unfortunately prevents his opposition from ever seeing his material. Sadly, only those who admire his political viewpoints are likely to see Capitalism: A Love Story, and those who despise his ostentatious methods will avoid it outright. While his style of documenting facts is slanted at best, the way he edits his films is fascinating and highly entertaining. Instilled with plenty of humor, the largely depressing topics become resoundingly more absorbable, and are unquestionably important. Grand, thundering music highlights his focal points, frequently increasing the hilarity or aiding in the finger-pointing. At times it's thrilling, tear-jerking, comedic, and thought-provoking, but always educational.		Capitalism is essentially the pursuit of the American Dream and it didn't set out to be evil. It was a good intention that only spiraled downward when it started to negatively control democracy. The rich want to stay rich, so the poor have no choice but to stay poor. Too bad the rich control the government and getting a piece of the wealth pie requires deciphering the foreign language of Wall Street. Moore presents many stances on democracy, socialism, taking advantage of others' misfortunes, profit motives, free enterprise, employers profiting on the deaths of their workers, propaganda, the Senate Housing Committee's failure to police mortgage scams and other white collar crimes, and bail outs, but ultimately the real villain is self-indulgence, consumption and greed. And for that there is no cure.		- The Massie Twins
0,A completely charming movie that does a gentle job of sending up popular music not only in the Eighties, but also on today's music scene. The Pop! Video steals the show. I will sometimes put the movie on just to watch this video. My one regret is that in the special featuress there isn't more on the making of the video. Hugh Grant (and Drew Barrymore on the demo they make) turn out to have singing voices as pleasing and agreeable as their onscreen personas and chemistry. A very rewatchable movie. Despite the good job Barrymore and Grant do, I have to say I think the guy who plays Grant's former partner "Colin" steals the screen in the video. His dancing is so tongue-in-cheek, over-the-top Eighties boy toy that it's hilarious. The line from the song, "You are gold and silver" has become a family joke around here.
0,Creepy, exiting , seat of your pants thriller. Jake is phenomenal as an evil ,budding videographer, who would sell his soul (and yours) to be part of the action and get paid for it.
0,Pretty funny
0,Wow! What do I say about this movie. Very few movies do I want to watch again - but this movie was that good. The really sad thing is this man, who made the second world war end sooner, didn't get any acknowledgment until this movie came out. Only then did the Queen of England grant him some special recognition (in 2013). I don't want to ruin the story - so you'll have to watch the story to find out more. I laughed. I cried. And then I was so filled with appreciation that we have these beautiful alien souls who come here to help us - and we don't understand them - and try to change them - and we make them miserable instead of celebrating them. This movie celebrates this strange, and wonderful man.
0,Very sentimental and emotional look at war. It's not your everyday war film, but more about the inner struggle of war against the turpitude and heinousness we all engage in.		It's not about a villian and good guys, it's about the disgust of war.
0,This is probably as good as it will ever get, as a documentary on Hendrix. Some especially valuable moments include Eddie Kramer playing a master tape of Little Wing and demonstrating just how good the vocal is when he fades down all the other tracks, and pretty much all the comments by Chas Chandler and Linda Keith. They alone are worth the price of admission. Her commentary, and the clips from a couple other female friends, provide some perspective that was sadly missing from the otherwise comprehensive book, "setting the record straight."		But, like any documentary intended for a mass audience, unfortunately it assumes we are idiots. For instance, we have to sit through a little lecture on the flexibility provided by multi-track recording.		And, the selection of interviewees spreads the net much more widely than was necessary or desirable. What the hell is Dweezil Zappa doing here, pontificating in a way that underlines the obvious while looking as if he is on the edge of a psycho meltdown? As for Rolling Stone magazine journalist David Fricke, he has no business being here at all, yet is allowed more time than anyone else, in which to "sum it all up" in the half-baked, patronizing, pseudo-intellectual style so characteristic of that magazine. If he had been omitted, there would have been more time for the people who really matter, such as Mitch Mitchell, who is allowed far less than he deserved. Presumably Fricke was considered necessary to explain Hendrix--another problem of aiming this documentary at a mass audience.		The short segments of Paul McCartney are valuable. I especially liked his comment about shy musicians who blossom on stage: "It's like they're let out of jail."		But there are some glaring omissions. No mention whatsoever, for instance, of contractual problems, financial problems, and the use of band members as hired hands. Almost no mention of management issues. No explanation of cause of death. In short, nothing remotely controversial.		The clips and photos of early street scenes (including a photo of the Cafe Wha? sign, and stills of Jimi in early bands) are wonderful. Some serious photo research was done here.		Five stars because the positive elements matter so much. Maybe one star for the producer who allowed unimportant characters to chat ad-nauseam while editing down people who were actually involved in Hendrix's life and music.
0,Good
0,A great series.....and I knew absolutely nothing about the Witchblade comic book prior to viewing this series.  Yancy Butler is beautiful, and showed great skills as an actress in this series.  She was able to go the full range of emotions, be tough and physical when needed, but also beautiful and lady-like other times.  I was really impressed, and would recommend this to anyone with interests in witchcraft, comic books, the Charmed and/or Angel series, etc.
0,Comedy, Action, Spy vs. Spy with a tilt toward the absurd.  The only thing the characters didn't do was curve the bullet around corners.  I groaned at some of the over the top Bond style technology while still grinning from ear to ear.  I see Samual L. Jackson's character as cross between his Elijah Price from Unbreakable and his Zeus Carver from Die Hard with the voice of the Water Boy.  He plays a great villain! Very much like a villain of Clouseau.  I recommend a bowl of popcorn and enjoy.
0,This movie was super cheesy and extremely entertaining, just like any dark comedy should. If you ignore the follies to the laws of physics, then you too will enjoy this movie. Low budget, less than spectacular special effects, and corny story line makes one laugh and leaves one with a mischievous little grin.
0,Great
0,When Family Guy went on sale on Amazon, it was an instant no brainer to snatch up seasons I had yet to purchase. If your a fan of Family Guy, most likely will love this Season! Its a good one, well packaged and produced! Cannot go wrong with every buying anything to watch the antics of the Griffins!
0,This is a stunning period epic, though not historically accurate. Then again, these historical dramas seldom are. Nonetheless, Vanessa Redgrave, in the title role of Mary Stuart, the first Queen Regnant of Scotland, is luminous. She plays the beleagured Scottish Queen to perfection, at times skittish and capricious and, alternately, commanding and royal. Patrick McGooghan is marvelous as her bastard half brother, the dour Earl of Moray, who is coldly implacable in his ambition and desire to sit upon the Scottish throne. Nigel Davenport is excellent in the role of the virile and sexy Earl of Bothwell, whom he plays as a man of some integrity, who, while ambitious, is loyal to Mary, whom he loves. Glenda Jackson is magnificent in the role of Elizabeth I of England, imperious, wily, and intelligent, a master of political intrigue and statesmanship. Timothy Dalton strikes the only discordant note, as his portrayal of the dissolute Lord Darnley is one dimensional and falls flat, leaving the viewer to wonder what Mary saw in him in the first place.		The film begins with an idyllic scene in France, which shows Mary with her then husband, Francois, the King of France. He dies a premature death, and there being no love lost between Mary and her sharp tongued mother-in-law, she returns to her native Scotland, where she is Queen in her own right. When Mary, a staunch Catholic, arrives with her retinue in Scotland, she is given a most unroyal and barely civil welcome by her half brother, the Protestant Earl of Moray, and the Lords of the Congregation. She is also repudiated by the Calvinist reformer, John Knox, who denounces her in no uncertain terms. Mary is surprised by his vitriolic attack, as she is quite progressive for her time and believes in religious tolerance. She is all for worshipping according to one's own conscience. The terms of her reign, however, are finally made clear to her by her half brother, whom she, understandably, hates by now. She, an anointed Queen, is to be a puppet, and he, the power behind the throne.		Meanwhile, Protestant half brother dearest intrigues with the Protestant Elizabeth I of England. She is concerned about Mary, a Catholic Queen with a legitimate claim to the English throne, as her own kingdom has some unrest between Catholics and Protestants. As a direct result of the intrigue, Mary makes a most unfortunate marriage to the dissolute Lord Darnley, a handsome but morally weak noble with a proclivity for insalubrious activities. She soon provides Scotland with an heir, but her marriage to Darnley is doomed and sets off a chain of events from which would follow murder, regicide, and a second marriage to an ambitious Scottish border lord, the Earl of Bothwell. This event is ultimately the catalyst for an enforced abdication by Mary and exile to England, where she is under house arrest for nineteen years. Her son and husband denied her, this most unhappy of women is finally caught in an intrigue with Catholic English lords. Elizabeth I reluctantly orders her execution upon a finding of treason. In the end, however, it is Mary, who has the last laugh, as Elizabeth I is childless, and Mary's son, James, would one day ascend to the English throne, being next in the line of succession.
0,does anyone make movies like this anymore? Do screen personas exist like these anymore?  The writing, the acting (the hitch hiking scene..classic). You don't need me to tell you how wonderful this movie is.

0,Hopefully you know the story of this film. If not, I am sure you have heard of the Hollywood version ALIVE. This Mexican version from 1976 blows away the glossy Hollywood version! It is interesting that this clocks in right under two hours and when released here in states as SURVIVE! it ran under 90 minutes. I am sure that back in '76 American distributor was cashing in on the exploitation element of the film. It was popular at drive-ins here in the south, for its cannibalism elements. But this version from Urban Vision seems to be the better choice when viewing this classic (although its long running time) it just seems more complete in this form. It is in original Mexican dialog with English subtitles burned in the video (so you can't switch them off). The video is presented in 4x3 full frame format. This doesn't' really hurt this presentation in any way (in fact, it gives it more of a documentary feel to what you are seeing). If you can get it cheap enough, and if you know the story, this is a good find. Wouldn't waste my time on the truncated version, now that this version is out there. Grab a copy while you can!<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Survive-Supervivientes-de-los-Andes/dp/B00009MGGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Survive (Supervivientes de los Andes)</a>
0,Its a must have for any movie collector.
0,This live concert dvd of the B52's performing in their hometown of Athens, Georgia, during February of 2011 is 131 minutes of "PURE FUN". This is simply the B52's at their very best. This concert dvd certainly proves the B52's are the undisputed, "BEST PARTY BAND IN THE WORLD", period. The B52's are really "into it" and so is the huge, packed crowd, making this one fantastic concert dvd. Watching this live concert dvd is "almost like being there", but probably ever better, because of the close-ups, different camera angles and etc.		Along with the B52's, you also get additional backing musicians. B52 Band Members Kate, and Cindy are as lovely as ever. I noticed a sign in the crowd that stated "Ricky is Here". Ricky Wilson, the original guitarist for the B52's died from AIDS in 1985. He was Cindy's brother. It's was nice to see that he was remembered.		Since the Amazon Product Description does not list the songs, then I will. The songs are as follows:	1. Pump	2. Private Idaho	3. Mesoptamia	4. Ultraviolet	5. Dancing Now	6. Give Me Back My Man	7. Funplex	8. Whammy Kiss	9. Deadbeat Club	10. Roam	11. B52 Girls	12. Party Out of Bounds	13. Love in the Year 3000	14. Cosmic Thing	15. Hot Corner	16. Love Shack (Tin Roof RUSTED!!!!)	17. Wig	18. Stobe Light	19. Planet Claire	20. Rock Lobster		Also, you get a bonus Interview with the B52's. This is a very interesting interview, where Keith, Fred, Cindy & Kate recount a history of the band. Fred and Kate were from New Jersey, while Keith, Cindy and the late/great Ricky were from Athens, Georgia (home of The University of Georgia). Also, they recall Ricky's contribution to the band, especially the song "Rock Lobster".		The only shortcoming I could find, is that the 1992 hit "Good Stuff" was not included. However, this in only minor, the rest of the songs are more than good enough to make up for this.		The Bottom Line: This is the B52's after 34 years together, performing as only the "BEST PARTY BAND IN THE WORLD" can perform. BUY IT, YOU'LL LOVE IT!!!!
0,Great classic film.
0,Love this show!!
0,For once I bought a movie on Amazon that lived up to the high scores on reviews.  The token love story wasn't bad and worked for this one.  Acting was excellent, especially and as usual Holden.  And per other reviewers here, the aviation footage is spectacular.  All in color.  A very important of United States pioneering aviation history preserved!		Note early on in the movie Holden walks past the X-2 and the cockpit windows design is an identical match for the helmets of Darth Vader's storm troopers of Star Wars fame.  No joke, Spielberg and Lucas clearly lifted it from this movie and used it for the helmet design. No, I'm not crazy.  Take a look!  Just like they also lifted the Star Wars I death star attack sequence cockpit crew camera shots right out of "Mosquito Squadron" starring Cliff Robertson.  Go on.  Take a look at that one, too.		I also think parts of "The Right Stuff" was also adapted from this movie.  Notice the far off crash smoke from James Garner's plane matches that seen in "The Right Stuff" when Yeager's F-104 crashes in the desert.  The camera angle and cinematic photography is a match.  The only thing "The Right Stuff" has on this flick is the advanced production capabilities brought by decades of growth in the movie-making industry.  But that's all.  I liked this movie much better.  Because of the whole "Edwards AFB" real looks and the real shots of the aircraft of the time, it just seems more real to me.  This movie was made when all the advances in aviation depicted in "The Right Stuff" were actually and simultaneously taking place.  I think this gives it a much more authentic feel as a result.		I really enjoyed this movie.  More than worth the purchase price.  As other reviewers have noted, you'll watch it multiple times for the chance to see these historic airplanes fly again.
0,Great movie
0,We love this series and think it is the best of the British murder shows.  The characters are great and the shows are very well written.
0,All Avenger movies are fun to watch
0,Still loving it!
0,Incredible movie from start to finish. Cate is one of those actresses that I'd watch read the phone book. I thought they lessened Geoffrey Rush's character a bit in this film but I loved it nevertheless. I give it 5 stars and I think you will too!
0,I ordered this item as a pre-order.  During the process the price was adjusted from $21.99 to $12.99.  When I received this item April 27, 2013 I was charged $21.99 and no adjustment had been made to the $12.99 price.  I like the product but was deply disappointed in the pricing.  I spend a lot of money shopping on Amazon and would appreciate attention in this matter. This also applies to Season 2.  Season 4 did have the adjusted price.

0,About Ring the Bell:		Ring The Bell shares the story of a slick, big city sports agent Rob Decker who seems to have it all. But on his latest mission to sign a high school baseball superstar, Rob becomes stranded in a small town where the simplicity of life--and the faith of the people--stand in stark contrast to his own fast-paced, win-at-all-costs mindset. Torn between these two worlds, will Rob have the courage to let faith transform his life? This heartwarming story of redemption is sure to entertain and inspire the whole family.		Ring The Bell features a host of well-known Christian music artists, such as Mark Hall along with his band Casting Crowns, Steven Curtis Chapman, and Matthew West, all who play a role in this inspirational drama. Several former and current Major League Baseball all-stars are also featured in the film: ESPN analysts John Kruk and Rick Sutcliffe (a former Cy Young Award winner), along with Ben Zobrist.		This family-friendly movie was produced by Mark Miller, Beach Street Records' founder and Casting Crowns' producer. Miller, who is also the lead singer and founder of country music group Sawyer Brown, co-wrote the script with Thomas Weber and Weber directed the production.		  Ring the Bell is available on DVD for only $19.99		  DVD Special Features:		  		  The Heart of "Ring the Bell"		  Casting Crowns "The Well" Music Video		  On Set with Casting Crowns		  Famous Faces		  A Very Special Movie		  Ringing the Bell		  The Artists and Music of "Ring The Bell"		To watch a trailer of the film go to this link		My Review:		 First of all, an amazing film! My family and I enjoyed it so much. It is a great movie with an awesome message. Money and riches and the best career in the world should never take the place of a relationship with the Almighty. Rob Decker a sports agent on a mission seems to think he has this one in the bag. He will talk this young man into signing with him and the agency he represents and he will turn around and head back home. But this little town and the people who live here give him a look into the "real world". A world he didn't realize he would want to be a part of.		 This is a very endearing film one that is sure to stir things up in your family. It is for young and old alike. It applies to all of us. So there is definitely a lesson to learn in this one.

0,Nice how can you lose with a cast of Cosby, Raquel and Yates truly a classic
0,Show doesn't really need any more rave reviews, but this package is quite nice. Haven't viewed the bonus features yet...		Only issue I saw was a weird anomaly in that episode where Sansa discovers "Reek" in the kennels at Winterfell. Video got distorted for a second or two and then returned to normal. Could have been my PS4 having a panic attack though.
0,Peter Davison is superb, in this highly unusual series.		The supporting cast, too, are all highly enjoyable and convincing. The fact that Davison the hard working, plodding but, in the end brilliant detective, is such a wuss regarding his estranged wife, was brilliant in its conception. It is always good to have heroes who have Achilles heels!		This series is brilliant and extremely well directed. Everyone, who enjoys a good detective yarn and a genuine smile, should see it.
0,I'm torn on this one. Louie seems torn too. On the one hand, he wants to think he's a "good" person, but then he seems to really spend a lot of his show justifying his behavior; which seems to indicate he doesn't truly think he is.  I know he's a comedian and this is meant to be funny, and some of it genuinely is, but I really have to say that I hurt for him as I watch this show. I can't stop watching it, so I guess that's good from a review standpoint, but it's almost painful to see how he struggles to work through the issues with which he deals.		One thing that seems to be a recurrent theme is that Louie is only saying what we're all really thinking. If you said to him that you never wanted to kill your children, I get the sense that he'd accuse you of lying. We're all sinful, and we all have the capacity to have such feelings, but I think the religious struggle depicted here (he spends a lot of time on this subject BTW) shows that he was just thrown under the bus by his unbelieving mother, which really had an impact on him. After that, he spent a lot of time trying to reconcile his Christian education with his mother's mis-teachings.  Of course we all love our mothers and we look up to them, so how do we reconcile what they "teach" us and what is taught by the church.		As a Christian, I really do live in the world and pay attention to what's going on here.  I like to observe and interact with unbelivers so that I can better understand them.  I pray for LouieCK and everyone like him. I really do understand him better now.  I had turned off his comedy show one time because it was so very offensive and hard to watch, but after watching season 1 of this show, I understand him better now. I really think God could use someone as smart and funny as Louie. It would be nice to have him on our side.
0,Never disappointed
0,I agree that it's about time that they dropped the price on the Star Trek DVD sets!! It was extremely outrageous to expect normal people to pay $100.00 + for each Season! We are finally buying the different sets, now that they are half the price. I think that there will be a BIG increase in sales now, and hopefully it will make Paramount see that they need to KEEP the prices lower. It's better to sell them at this price and get more sales, than to sell them at a ridiculous price and maybe get a few sales. As much as I love Star Trek, I'm not willing to pay an inflated amount for the DVD sets.		I love all of the Star Trek series, but ST:TNG is the one that got me hooked! I highly recommend everyone adding to their DVD collection now!
0,Entertaining and well done. I was amazed about how much I didn't know regarding cultural differences.
0,Love it, like I love every new workout Jane Fonda makes. A nice way to spend 2 x 20 min. walking at home.
0,Great movie. Watched it with my granddaughter who's a year and half. She loved it
0,Good show. always proved to be interesting.
0,At last, an informed film about music. It took genuine commitment to produce a story that is understood to appeal only to a select audience. It traces the quartet's quest for perfection in the face of intruding personal problems. You will hear portions of music played of generous length. The story seems to borrow some of  the known performance additions of the Emerson String Quartet. The role of the second violin is explained to show the real challenge and importance of its role. For those serious about 'serious' music, this is your film.		Harold J. Diamond
0,Good season.  Binged watched to catch up for season 5
0,It's a really funny movie. It's expensive for an old movie but this is the price everywhere.
0,Funny movie
0,It was suspenseful and required using a little grey matter. As I recall, not a lot of foul language. Which is a good thing as that never adds anything worthwhile to a program.
0,We loved it! Amazing finish to a great series.
0,From the mind and imagination of Bruce Dickinson comes a film "based on real events dramatized for entertainment."  Okay, that's what the credits say at least.  What we can say is Crowley is a deeply disturbing film that, if it is based on a `true' story, then it must have been one heck of a true story.		 The death of the notorious occultist, Aleister Crowley in 1947 was the end of a life spent in debauchery, sadism, moral degradation, and sexual excess.  His dedication to the mystic arts and study of mystic texts was legendary.  Two visiting Cambridge students, Symons and Victor,  witness the unholy death of Crowley after he reads about L Ron Hubbard and Jack Parsons and Moonchild.  53 years later, Dr Mathers brings a super cooled suit  to be hooked up to the Z93 supercomputer, only to find out that Oliver Haddo, a mild mannered classics professor, has been transformed into a re-incarnated Crowley ready to wreak havoc on campus!  The college newspaper wants a story on Dr Joshua Mathers, and their crack reporter, Lia, is drawn into a web of murder and demonic forces.  "The Beast" lives in Haddo, and through him, evil runs free.  Ritual murders, sadistic  practises, and intense sexual perversion explode on the campus.  Crowley/Haddo desperately wants the chemical wedding described in his early writing, and Lia is his chosen.  Mathers enters the `other' world and through a familiar object, the watch of Crowley, defeats him and changes the world.		Truly, this is one disturbing film.  Bruce Dickinson and Julian Doyle  are to be congratulated on their successful, horror film .  Many new products in the genre do not make the grade, yet this one manages to repulse viewers, and yet make  you hang on to watch.  The orgy scene....what can you say.  Wicked (and not in a good way either).  Crowley/Haddo masturbating to the summons made me wonder why I was watching this.  Simon Callow is a remarkable madman/hell sent professor.	With Dickinson writing the film, I expected more Maiden/heavy metal during the film.  He did restrain his work, and what does make it to film is good.  If this is a B grade film, then Stephen King is a hack!		If you like horror films, you will enjoy this, right to the depths of your scared soul.		Tim Lasiuta
0,It was excitingly different with lots of suspense. We enjoyed it!
0,In the first film class I ever taught I screened "The Last American Virgin" and learned the valuable lesson that showing a movie that inflames viewers is always going to be productive to class discussion. What my students found so offensive was the idea that there were boys in this country that were taking girls to see this film. That was probably a bit far fetched simply because this 1982 film would be one of the worst date movies ever made; watch this film and imagine that you are a sixteen year old girl on a date seeing this film and think about what thoughts about boys in general it inspires.	That is not to say that this film written and directed by Boaz Davidson is not without value. The story starts off as another one of those films where three friends, nice guy Gary (Lawrence Monoson), study Rick (Steve Antin), and fat guy David (Joe Rubbo) are interesting in having sex. Towards this end they pick up some girls with promises of cocaine (it is really Sweet 'n' Low), visit an overly amorous woman whose boyfriend comes home early, and finally go to a prostitute who gives them venereal disease. What I found fascinating about this film was what "lessons" it taught its viewers; for example, did you know that "crabs" can be cured by the chlorine in a swimming pool?	But then the film turns out to be about a love triangle. Gary loves Karen (Diane Franklin), pure and chaste from afar. Of course, Karen only has eyes for Rick. That is until she discovers she is pregnant and Rick dumps her. That is when "The Last American Virgin" becomes an unforgettable adolescent horror story and offers one of the most brutal endings you have ever seen in a teenager sex flick. This particular plot line will remind you of one of the plots in "Fast Time at Ridgemont High," but Davidson is not going for anything remotely like a happy ending, even short term.	My only serious complaint with this film is that the comic excesses of the first two-thirds of the film make the ending seem like a radical shift (although in terms of qualitative form it certainly sets up the ending for ultimate shock value). The ends may well justify the means, but as much as I admire the brutal honesty of the film's conclusion I still find the transition a bit jarring. "The Last American Virgin" is an unforgettable film in an often forgettable genre of American cinema.

0,The movie opens in rain-drenched England as down-hearted and dispirited Lottie Wilkins trudges through her day.  An advertisement in the paper promising "Wisteria and Sunshine" at an Italian castle catches her eye.  She seeks out another forlorn soul, Rose Arbuthnot, and convinces her to share this villa for the month of April.  Because of expenses, they are forced to also take in two strangers to share the load.  Joining them will be Mrs. Fisher, an elderly woman who is hoping to remember "better times and better men," and the beautiful Lady Caroline who is tired of the constant attention she receives and longs for a restorative quiet time.  When they arrive it is still raining, but at least as one of them so aptly puts it, "This is Italian rain."  When morning dawns, the sun comes out and remains with them for the month.	Enchanted with the peace and tranquility of her new surroundings, Lottie longs to share her joy with her husband.  When he arrives, Lottie urges Rose to invite her husband as well, but Rose fears that her husband, an author of racy novels under a pen name, will not come.  Imagine her surprise when he shows up immediately.  Of course, the catch is that he had no idea his wife was there but was hoping to have a dalliance with Lady Caroline.	In the peaceful Italian sun, marriages heal, new love blossoms, and unlikely friendships are born.  The movie is light, filled with delicious humor and profound sentiments to stir your heart and soul.	Most enchanting of all may be the beautiful scenes filmed on location in Portofino.  This is a great movie for self-medication in the gloom of winter when you want to seek greener pastures or just plain wonderful any day.
0,I've seen this film many times and never get tired of watching	it.  Gene Kelly and Judy Garland are really wonderful in it.	It has some great song and dance numbers in it, especially the one Gene and Judy dance to in the barn at the dance.  I'd give it more stars if I could.  I'd a real keeper.

0,In the early 1970's the Monty Python troop (Michael Palin, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, and Terry Jones) stars from the immensely popular television series Monty Python's Flying Circus began producing, with the help of a fundraising concert headlined by Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd (You lie!! No, I didn't!), initial photography on what would later become (from all my extensive years of movie watching) the single most unforgivably sidesplitting, enormously irreverent, shrewdly perceptive, unremittingly uproariously aggressive, gruesomely hysterical, and endlessly quotable comedies EVER. Not even Mel Brooks's Best Efforts (The Producers, Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein) comes very close to the revolutionary medieval merriment sustained in this royal purebred of cult classics. BAR NONE. No contest here.		Endlessly stockpiled with hauntingly hysterical sketches that will probably never leave your mind (no matter how hard you try) including, The Knights Who Say Nei, The Self-Abusing Monks (Eah aay ess eay dom eay nay), The Black Knight, The Trojan Rabbit, the Ever-Appearing Verbally Abusing French (I don't want to talk to you no more!!!), The Enchanter Named Tim, The Killer Bunny, The Bridge of Death (What is the capital of Hysteria?), The Old Woman Named Dennis, and so many countless more great sketches to include here that I'd die trying. Monty and Python and the Holy Grail remains an ever-enriching mirthful cult-classic that just seems to improve with age. Since Columbia has a bountifully hefty new special edition of the Holy Grail out now there should be no excuse, if you've never seen it (I think I'll go for a walk!!), just drop everything your doing (including Bringing Out Your Dead) and go experience this life changing movie today. You won't be disappointed, just tell them the Knight Not Appearing In This Film sent you, and they'll know what to do.	As for the options on the special edition here's a run-down:	Disc One: -"21st Anniversary" cut of the film running an extra 24 seconds;  -Anamorphic Widescreen; -Dolby 5.1 track; -Original Mono Track; -Audio commentary with Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones, John Cleese, Eric Idle and Michael Palin; -subtitles "for people who don't like the film" (you get the text from Shakespeare's Henry IV instead); -an "on-screen screenplay" feature which lets you read the screenplay as you watch the film; -"Follow the Killer Rabbit" feature;	Disc Two: "Three Mindless Sing-Alongs"; -"The Quest for the Holy Grail  Locations" featurette; -"How to Use Your Coconuts" educational film; -"Monty Python and the Holy Grail in Japanese" (with English subtitles); -the BBC Film Night special "On Location with the Pythons; -an interactive cast directory; -still galleries with Terry Gilliam's original sketches and behind-the-scenes photos; -"A Load Of Rubbish" with mystery items; -unused ideas and other material; -two trailers	and web-links.	Both discs represent the absolute final word resource for EVERYTHING and I do mean everything you'd need to know about the Python's greatest film. An Absolute Necessity for any Python Fan!!	P.S. You can't base a system of government just because some watery tart threw a sword at you.

0,Few movie experiences have been as sublime or heartrending as the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, which began with the forming of a Fellowship and grew with the battle against the Two Towers.		And in "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Peter Jackson brings JRR Tolkien's epic fantasy to its powerful, heartbreaking close. While the ending is notoriously gradual to unfold -- not surprising in a story this long and complicated -- it's a glorious experience that can only end in beauty, sorrow and the ultimate battle between good and evil.		Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are still following the treacherous Gollum (Andy Serkis) on the path to Mordor, with Frodo unaware that Gollum is sowing suspicion between the two best friends. By the time he realizes his mistake, he's been dragged into the lair of Shelob, a monstrous spider, and then abducted by orcs who want the Ring he carries. Determined to find his friend, Sam heads into an orc citadel to get Frodo back.		Meanwhile, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) takes Pippin (Billy Boyd) with him to Minas Tirith, after the hobbit has a close encounter with Sauron through a palantir. Not only is the city under siege, but the Steward Denethor is slowly going insane, even sending his one remaining son, Faramir (David Wenham), on a suicide mission to reclaim a dead city. With Minas Tirith crumbling, Aragorn's (Viggo Mortensen) only hope may to be summon an army of the dead, who will only obey the King of Gondor. But even the joined forces of Gondor and Rohan will not be enough to stop Sauron unless Frodo destroys the Ring -- and with his mind being worn away by its evil, he might not be able to.		The "Lord of the Rings" trilogy is one of those once-in-a-lifetime movie experiences. There has never been anything quite like it in movie history, and there probably never will be again. It seems somehow fitting that the book that every other fantasy has to measure up to, has now become a sweeping cinematic triumph that actually stays halfway loyal to the books. Good things come to fans who wait, I guess.		Peter Jackson manages to craft a genuine sense that this is an epic story -- the scope of the story grows even larger when Gandalf and Pippin ride to Minas Tirith, especially when we see the sweeping grandeur of the signal fires. And of course, he sweeps through a series of increasingly explosive battle scenes (involving oliphaunts, Black Riders and glow-in-the-dark ghosts). Each action scene a shattering ride, and there's no guarantee that all the beloved characters will make it out alive. Some of them don't.		But if Jackson manages the epic battles well, he does an even better job with the gentler, quieter moments. The action slows down, and the characters take a moment to support and comfort each other. They cry, they hug, they think about home -- such as Gandalf comforting the frightened Pippin with a description of the afterlife. Jackson and his fellow screenwriters Fran Walsh and Phillippa Boyens throw themselves into the semi-formal language of Tolkien's world, resculpting Tolkien's words into equally rich movie dialogue.		Elijah Wood gives an unparalleled performance as Frodo Baggins. Frodo's gradual deterioration is wrenching to watch, and the climactic scene at Mount Doom displays just what the Ring can do to even the pure-hearted hobbit. Sean Astin follows up with his powerful performance as Sam, who is increasingly the "strong" unbowed hobbit, rather than the follower ("I can't carry it for you... but I can carry you!"). The final scenes between these two outstanding actors are beautiful and understated.		But all the supporting cast also give powerful performances -- Boyd and Dominic Monaghan put their characters through some intense growing pains, as both younger hobbits are forced to deal with the horrors of war. Ian McKellen balances action with grandfatherly wisdom, and Bernard Hill, Miranda Otto as the despairing Eowyn and David Wenham as the noble, kindly Faramir all give amazing performances. And of course, the titular king is Mortensen's Aragorn, now faced with the ultimate challenges -- and possibly the ultimate sacrifices -- that will decide whether he falls or triumphs over Sauron.		Perhaps the most striking thing about "Return of the King" is the final fourth of the film. While the "multiple endings" may annoy some viewers, it seems somehow right to gently let go of these characters rather than have a sudden, splashy finale. And whether they have a happy or sad ending, Jackson never lets us forget that they all made sacrifices to battle Sauron.		"Return of the King" brings the epic "Lord of the Rings" trilogy to a close, and cements Jackson's reputation as a master filmmaker. With the outstanding cast, beautiful scripting and amazing direction, this is a fitting capstone to the trilogy.
0,Was not a bad rocom, but just not a good one.  Predictable plot.  Acting not bad but not outstanding.  Something to watch if you do not have a Nicholas Sparks film to watch.
0,Book was better than movie, but the movie followed the book pretty good. John walker and his family of spies should have been executed.
0,MOTIVES is a beautiful movie played by beautiful people showing Blacks as human - successful, greedy, sexy, plotting, humanitarian, selfish, ambitious - all the faults and good qualities which make us human. Excellent acting, settings, music and an engaging, twist filled plot make this a winner. Whatever you do, do not stop this movie when you think this ends, there is a very important scene at the end of the movie after the credits start which explains why things happened as they did and adds a powerful punch to the movie. I wish I could give this 10 stars.
0,Live this movie
0,This is one of my all-time favorites. This is one of the best movies that actually defined the whole "thriller" genre: an innocent layperson gets sucked into a plot and has difficulty in understanding what's happening to him. Cary Grant, playing a smug Madison Avenue ad executive, is swept into an international intrigue when he is mistaken for George Kaplan, a spy who is chased by the bad guys.		The film is full of iconic images like the dust-cropper scene or the final battle on Mount Rushmore. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, the film has its number of flaws -- the most famous being a kid in the Mount Rushmore cafeteria closing his ears before a gun is fired :-) However, the narrative thread is so strong, the plot and the characters sweep us along while we suspend all judgement and enjoy the ride.		Cary Grant offers one of his top-notch performances as a handsome leading man on the run who always has time for a wisecrack or two. A MUST see film for movie fans of all ages. Highly recommended.

0,Love this movie. Great action and adventure. Definitely watch again
0,A silly but sometimes serious caper film set in WWII Europe. It features several major stars: Clint Eastwood, Telly Savalas, Donald Sutherland, Carroll O'Connor, Don Rickles and more.	Fanciful, though not completely impossible, tale of a US Army recon unit that stumbles onto the location of a supply of gold during the Allied liberation of Europe. Eastwood is the driving force behind the caper (stealing the gold), Savalas the tough sargent, O'Connor the commanding general, Rickles the deal maker, and Sutherland an outrageous hippie tank commander. The chemistry between the characters is great, and the story is well told.	The movie is well made, the dialog well written and well acted, and the DVD transfer seems quite good. The exteriors were shot in Yugoslavia, and most of the hardware seems accurate. The Sherman tanks, jeeps, and halftracks are real, and while I'm not an expert, the Tiger tanks appear to be the real thing also. While Hollywood can be quite good at illusion (that is their business, after all), the Tigers' drive and bogey wheels match the pix of Tigers I have seen much more closely than that of American APCs. I did find the sound of the machine guns off, however. German machine guns of that era had a higher rate of fire than American guns like the Thompson. If you listen to the firefights, it seems like the sounds are reversed, with the American machine guns firing faster than the German ones. A small nitpick.	All in all, a mostly fun film with some grim battle and death scenes. (It IS a war film) The thing that keeps bringing me back is Sutherland's portrayal of the completely anachronistic "Oddball," which is great for showing his range when compared to his roles in films like The Dirty Dozen, MASH, JFK, Ordinary People, Eye of the Needle, Buffy, Backdraft, Outbreak, etc. (Check out his filmography, it's impressive.)
0,Excellent DVD for any who are interested in Dinosaur's . Well worth it.
0,Love this show and wish we could get the entire series or box set.  The grand kids love watching them and spend many quiet hours watching.
0,This is a great parody of all the hood movies that came out in the early 90's.  "Don't Be a Menace" throws laughs at Hood Flicks such as "Juice", "Menace To Society", & "Boyz In Da Hood".  So if u haven't seen those movies, you might not understand a lot of the comedy in this....but if u have seen em, check this out!
0,Fun film. Beautiful music.
0,My wife and I both loved it, how often can you say that a movie?
0,I have read many reviews appropriately commenting on the wonderful performance of Audrey Tautou as Turkish Immigrant Senay in Stephen Frears' "Dirty Pretty Things", but I haven't seen a comparable amount of words praising the tight, believable script and the wonderfully noble performance by Chiwetel Ejiofor as Okwe, a Doctor from Lagos on the run from authorities for reasons that are not revealed until well into the final act.  My favorite movies ares ones with strong leading characters who act with heroic nobleness.  I get an absolute thrill watching Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch, or Humphrey Bogard as Rick Blaine, forcing Ilsa to get on that plane out of Casablanca because he loves her and knows there will be hell to pay to take any other course.  I love it when Indiana Jones is secretly watching the child slaves in "Temple of Doom" and he is just so outraged that without thinking he plunks a guard with a rock.		Okwe is such a character.  He is a man of principles, working shoulder to shoulder with desperate people in a world without principles.  His status as an illegal alien makes it impossible for him to even think about working as a Doctor.  So to make ends meet he works two menial jobs. He drives a cab for a company with other drivers who routinely stop him in the back room to get treatment for their gonorrhea.  At his other job he works as night porter at the kind of hotel that has an hourly rate to accommodate the prostitutes who bring their work to these rooms.		Okwe is the kind of man who plays chess and engages in deep, meaningful conversations for fun.  His friend Guo Yi works at the hospital morgue, loses to Okwe in chess, and procures antibiotics for all the cases of the drip back at the cab company.		This movie also has several characters who see nothing wrong with exploiting the perpetually scared immigrants.  Two different characters force desperate young women into having sex rather than being reported to Immigration, and in this movie these coerced rapes are just tips of the seedy iceburg underbelly.		The way the movie progresses was uplifting to me, though, although it would be too much of a spoiler to say why.  By the end I felt that the noble characters had escaped with their self-respect intact, and the two scumbags had received comeuppances of a painful sort.		The cinematography was reminiscent of Tautou's other famous film, Amelie.  If you like watching movies about characters that you can care about, I recommend Dirty Pretty Things highly.
0,this was a very good and educational film about one of our most important founding fathers. Everyone remembers Washington and Jefferson, but few remember Adams who was one of the driving forces behind our independence from England
0,The Aviator is a really good film you gotta see. I have yet to see Shutter Island.
0,Good
0,Funny movie with great color and clarity.
0,great
0,Excellent
0,I love this show its hilarious. I got the DVD set for someone as a gift, he hasn't watched it partly because we have it on TV all the time, but he was happy when he received it and whenever he gets around to watching it he will love it as will I because the show is great.
0,Super
0,I have only watched the first season so far, but I have really enjoyed it a lot.
0,If you are a fan of comedies, you will certainly enjoy these three films.	They are definitely some of my favorites.
0,Totally frightening!
0,Really good re-telling of the Dracula story
0,If you  are a fan of Torchwood...then you have to have this. It is a blend of the old team and the new American Team.  And completes any Torchwood fan's collection.  Miracle day is NOT the miracle it seems, in fact the rapid non-death quickly shows just what a curse eternal life might be not merely for those not dying but those being born on a planet with finite resources. But then Miracles are like two edged swords when Torchwood is involved.
0,Really liked this video
0,I love DreamWorks!
0,I'm not sure why I thought this movie was just ok back in 97' but after a fresh viewing it's a hell of a lot better then my memoir serves. Couple of things though. It's obvious now that the story is a cross between Solaris, the 1972 Russian Sci-Fi film, and Hellraiser. Not that that's a bad thing just interesting and something I didn't pick up on in '97. They even go as far as copy a direct scene from Solaris which is the wife killing herself and the husband reliving it. In Solaris, it turns out that the planet is a giant organism and can take those tragic memories and experiences and manifest them into physical form, though it's purpose was not evil doing, but experimentation. Probing another intelligence as the scientist were probing it with their x-Ray experiments. Of course Event Horizon takes this premise and turns into more horror elements via a Hellraiser scenario and it works very well. The only real complaint I had was the very last scene. It seemed like a badly executed after thought. Almost a cheap scare really. Glad I re-watched. I'll have to pick this up on Blu at some point.
0,I have ever seen, but it is very interesting and moving in certain ways.  The first 15 minutes of the film is fascinating, but it all makes sense at the end of the film.  I am a big fan of Lars VT, and Dogville is one of my favorite movies.  Melancholia is beautifully filmed and the acting is superb.  The beginning and the end are rather dramatic, but the middle is rather slow and nuanced.  Interesting film, and fascinating photography; very dramatic and effective.
0,I have liked the toy story movies... although I wish they had not put the sadistic kid in the one movie - too gross for me. But they are funny and sweet and just a hoot.
0,Sofia is the first princess show on Disney Jr.  My preschooler loves it.  I even like it.  Recommend it.  It is, as with all Disney products, excellent.
0,Very interesting and well made I like documentaries with survivors in them as this is
0,I bought this dvd for my 3 year old granddaughter she loves it.  She has watched it so much until she talks along with them. I bought 5 more just to keep her entertained.
0,Very funny!
0,AWESOME!
0,After watching MAXED OUT, I felt absolutely sick to know that I am one of millions Americans contributing to the increasingly dangerous and potentially crippling consumer debt; that, unfortunatly, is clearly identical to the National Debt.		This very organized, simple to understand documentary showed me the error of my ways and how to avoid any future credit pitfalls.		If you are living paycheck to paycheck, hand to mouth...whatever, you need to watch MAXED OUT.  You may think you've been smart with your money...but if you have debt, chances are you've paid some of the stupid taxes mentioned within this film.		This is a must see for everyone.  I even made my 16 year old son watch this movie so that he could [hopefully] bypass the heartbreak of college sponsored credit cards; and avoid the outcome of so many young people's lives because of getting into debt when they just weren't old enough to know better.		Watch it!  Think about it!  It will change your life!
0,I originally rented this film in the library. Its very long and thats a good thing since its a great film with a surprise element to it. If you enjoy the past, romance,the old ways which were very polite , and you want to be taken back to another time and place , watch this film . Its also very unique, you will see what I mean. I bought it because its a great film and it transports you to another time and place which we all need every now and then . You will not get bored I promise.
0,a bit juvenal but good story
0,Good, light,  Sci Fi, with a very good Brit actor baddy
0,Great plots, dialogue, acting, directing-one of the all time best British crime dramas.
0,This item is worthy of five stars
0,The movie is very amateurishly made but the story content is so good, the characters and their trials are real and the blessings they receive will have you grabbing a tissue.
0,Great family film.
0,The disc came from Amazon quickly, Good packaging. Excellent movie, recommned to everybody. I am very pleased with the order I placed.
0,I ENJOYED THIS DVD OF THE SERIES VERY MUCH. IT WAS A GOOD PROGRAM. ONLY WISH THEY STILL HAD IT ON TV.
0,It was a good show; but it didn't get any farther than them in their apartment and apartment hunting....
0,Great for my son
0,"World on a Wire" is a 1973 two-part film made for German TV by director Rainer Werner Fassbinder concerning the meaning of reality. It is science fiction in that it deals with people and ideas set against a scientific or technological background - not with space monsters.	A government research institute is attempting to build a simulated world inside a computer and populate it with artificial people, with the idea that social and economic problems can be simulated via the community inside the computer. With the project nearing completion, the project director, Professor Vollmer, begins acting strangely during a meeting with a government minister, and dies mysteriously shortly thereafter. But, not before revealing to a friend that he has discovered a secret connected with the project -- something no one is suppose to know about! Vollmer's assistant, Fred Stiller, is promoted to Director and told to complete the project quickly.	Stiller soon learns about Vollmer's claim to have found something wrong, and suspects his death was not accidental. Stiller looks and acts more like a 70s detective than a computer scientist: hard drinking, heavy smoking, and tailor-made suits. In fact, he spends much more time on his investigation than he does actually working on the project.	In a subplot, the Institute's overall director, Siskins, a polished, well-manicured money man, is planning to sell the project's data to private industry rather than release it to the public.	There is a major revelation at the end of Part One, with enough twists and turns in Part Two to keep you guessing right up to the end. In fact, the film gets better and better with subsequent viewings as you can appreciate how skillfully the story is peppered with clues - even the acting style itself is a clue.	I recommend it highly with a few words of warning. The film has the usual polish one expects from a Criterion restoration, but was shot on 16mm film and may be too grainy for some tastes, and since it was made for 70s TV it is not wide screen. Also, it is in German with English subtitles, but no English soundtrack.
0,I have always liked him in movies.  This was pretty good.  Love the butt kicking!!  He loved that dog!!
0,this movie i can watch it over and over and not get tired of it. a movie of wining love
0,I enjoyed it. Very different role for Meg Ryan.
0,Took me a while to accept Daniel as 007, but he kinda grows on you.	Casino Royale gave a good account of how James Bond became 007. Great story-telling.	Quantum sort of let down as the story continued from Casino...	Good thing Skyfall redeem it for Daniel as a human being who could fail.
0,awesome
0,Great romantic comedy....Tom Hanks falls in love with a dog and a vet, lol.  Truly a classic
0,a classic!!!!
0,Out on a Limb - Waiting for the Light - Postcards from the Edge - The Apartment ... these films show why this film is so successful. Shirley has a knack for bringing her A game to the screen. The chemistry for making a good film a great one has to include the screen presence - the making of characters real, and she and her co-star, Christopher Plummer make this film so real by making love between two people a reality. It's what all of us want, and this film delivers it.
0,The Blood Gulch Chronicles is one of the funniest shows I've seen in a long time. Very good story line, Perfect characters, great use of Halo 1 and 2's multiplayer actions. I recommend for all Halo series fans.
0,For me, crossword puzzles have been a casual thing, I might find one in the airline magazine on a flight and work on it to pass the time or my wife, who is a much more avid fan, might have left a partially finished one about, which I will pick up and see if I can find some answers.		Those who appear in this movie find crossword puzzles to be anything but casual. And this is not about just any crossword puzzle. This is the "gold standard." The NYT crossword puzzle. You may genuflect if you wish.		As the movie unfolds we hear how the NYT graduates the difficulty of its puzzles from Monday to Sunday. We learn how they are constructed, how they are made more difficult, what the rules of puzzle building are and how crossword puzzles infect and afflict those who are addicted to them. Celebrities from Ken Burns to Jon Stweart are utilized in cameo pieces, some of which are very entertaining.		This all culminates in the Marriott Hotel in Stamford, CT where the World Crossword Puzzle Championship takes place every year in March. We meet some of the contestants, we are shown how the tournament is organized and the friendships it has engendered during the years it has been held and as the days pass we get to the "A" finals where three finalists try to solve a puzzle against time on large easels set up at the front of the room which will really draws you in to the genre.		Whether crossword puzzles are your thing or not, this is an entertaining and interesting movie to see. It did not encourage me to increase my crossword puzzle activity, but it sure gave me a deeper appreciation of what those who are hooked on it go through. There is something in this movie for everyone.
0,Cannot review Blu-ray, do not own player yet, but purchased combo pack to get remastered DVD, as all other copies of this movie are poor picture quality. Originally reported this DVD to be faulty, as it skipped, and asked for a refund, which was given. After, thought maybe only wanted cleaning, despite being new and in a sealed pack. Used alcohol and lint free cloth. Movie now perfect, picture quality very good. Have advised customer service that refund not required. Waiting for their response.
0,Well done
0,Well written, well acted. I'm now a binge watcher!
0,Love the old shows its just good tv and I'm very happy with my product and service received here
0,Any film with a fellow natural American is a good win!
0,On one level, Terry Zwigoff's newest film is a tale of teenage angst and an odd romance.  The film's main character, Enid, has a genuinely dark and skeptical view of humanity and popular culture.  Zwigoff does a marvelous job in showing how Enid stumbles into a romance with Seymour, a nerdy, 40-something record collector, and how she reacts to that relationship.  At times, I saw Enid saying and doing things for no logical reason -- very accurate for an 18-year-old.  The director excels at creating a very realistic portrayal of how a teenager thinks and acts...much better than American Pie (1 or 2)!	More importantly, Ghost World is a biting satire on America's cultural ignorance, savaging popular culture left and right - sappy movies, political correctness, record collectors, cliched artwork (and art teachers), and more - you gotta look for it!  My favorite scene in the movie placed Enid and Seymour in a bar where an old blues legend was opening up for this cheesy, Blues Traveler-esque "blues" band that passes itself off as authentic "delta blues."  The frat boys in attendance pay more attention to the sports game on the TV than the bluesman, and when the headliner takes the stage, they all break out dancing like some lounge show (leaving Seymour aghast).	Yeah, the romance angle was nice, but I relished the director's sharp-witted stabs at popular culture.  Pardon me for snugly smirking at ya next time in the video store, but you'll know why after you've seen this film!
0,William Powell and Myrna Loy are GOLD as Nick and Nora Charles in this, the very best of the Thin Man Series. The laughs never stop coming, as one-liner after one-liner are exchanged. At times the characters names and their roles can become a bit confusing, but you'll enjoy this film never the less.		Jimmy Stewart also has a nice little role, and is the best of the supporting cast. One of the best scenes in the film is when Nora brings Nick to her family's for New Years Eve. As soon as they enter the living room, one of her aunts says very seriously, "Nora, you poor girl." (none of the relatives are very fond of her husband). Nick later enjoys some quality time with his in-laws, having a conversation with them as they snore (really quite a brilliantly funny scene). Also, for those of you who have seen Mel Brookes films and are quite familiar with the "walk this way" gag (recycled much too much), you'll like seeing it in this film.		The nice thing about After The Thin Man is that, unlike it's predecessor, it is never boring. I sort of thought The Thin Man got off on a slow start, where the second installment of the series gets started off right away. Another scene not to be missed: when Asta almost eats a clue! Nick and Nora go crazy trying to retrieve the info from the dog, who thinks it's all just a game. This a very fun comedy that is not to be missed!!
0,A continued Walker series that is as good as the others. He is a Good Guy that wins. Good family show.
0,The goofiness of the characters is sometimes too much and I have to fast forward scenes.
0,Fairly well written story. Typical ending, but no other way it could've been done so. Statham should be doing more dramatic roles.
0,Excellent film and unusually candid. This is the reason why my son does virtual school from home, and even then he is still influenced by State required assessments and a curriculum which sometimes doesn't make sense. If this continues I may have to go full home school.
0,Description is dead on. Everyone knows how great the movie is.	I am reviewing the package and presentation which are pretty good for a special edition. No complaints at all.
0,Better than the original
0,Good plot
0,Stille on of the best sci-fi movies ever made and will always be timeless. Much better without narration although one can turn it on.
0,great for the kids and adult alike
0,They did a good representation of Henry the 8th.  Though Henry the 8 got so big throughout his reign that they had to widen the castle's doors.  The costumes and Jewelry were outstanding. The actor were great and did outstanding performances.  Henry the 8th was a complex character who executed a number of his wives and ministers.  Though many of the ministers deserved their fates for their greed and pushing their own agendas. He forced his wants and desires which were his to force.  In some ways Jonathan Rhys Meyers made Henry the 8th as an almost likeable character.  I almost felt sorry for him.  Henry the 8th was a deadly man who ruled his kingdom with an iron fist and many many deaths to his subjects. Because he wanted, what he wanted, when he wanted it.
0,Love ~ Love ~ Love this movie! 5 stars.....
0,Great movie. Johnny Depp is awesome.
0,This movie I have watched at least 15 times. Forget overthinking the movie or the actors. It's a good story and worth watching. It has some great elements in the movie, and how can you not love Dennis Storhi. To me he made the movie. It has great scenes. The epic King Buliwyf ....just buy the movie and enjoy.
0,This was my 2nd time viewing this series, but the 1st time through Amazon Prime.  Technical details, actor's performances, & storyline are excellent.  It's a VERY good show & IMHO ranks right up with "Saving Private Ryan" as well as the other outstanding WWII series, (also by HBO, I think) "The Pacific."		Being able to get this free via Amazon is outstanding.
0,Every good myth starts with a foundation of fact and some vastly powerful being or beings - in this case, Beethoven fills both roles. Then the mythmaker adds some fictional elements to set the story in motion - here, Anna Holtz does the job. Finally, the story requires drama. Could anything be more dramatic than the birth of Beethoven's sublime Ninth Symphony? Throw in some very fine actors, including Ed Harris in the title role (he also starrd in&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Pollock/dp/B00005KHJJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Pollock</a>), and a good movie becomes almost unavoidable.		Anna enters the scene as an eager student, the best of her composition intructor's recent crop. Her job, as copyist, is to take the maestro's rough notes (musical nots, in this case), and transcribe them into final form. In this story, she's no mere scribe, but Beethoven's partner and intellectual soul-mate. You could call this a romance story of the most chaste and intellectual kind, but intimate nonetheless.		Beethoven comes across as fiercely driven, fiercely egotistical, and just plain fierce. Holtz's delicate beauty tames that "beast", as he was termed early on. That feat came about more through her own strength and artistic skill than through her comeliness, though. I enjoyed seeing the fictional Holtz in a strong role, as improbable as it might historically have been. If you don't mind Beethoven the man being co-opted into a fictional setting that rewrites a few of his historical facts, this movie offers plenty to enjoy.		-- wiredweird
0,I remember watching these with my parents when I was younger. I loved it. At that time it was the bomb.
0,FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE is one of the most underrated film epics of all time. It has a very intelligent script, witty dialogue and an insightful sense of humor (the intellectually amusing banter between Alec Guinness as Marcus Aurelius and James Mason as Timonides is far above that found in biblical type epics). The cast is impressive including Sophia Loren, Anthony Quail, John Ireland, Omar Sharif and Mel Ferrer (probably his best screen performance as the blind and deceitful Cleander). James Mason gives a lesson in histrionics giving yet another brilliant performance unlike anything he had done previously.		Robert Krasker's cinematography especially filmed on the frozen frontier with the ominous forest in the background and snowflakes blustering across the screen are astonishingly atmospheric combined with one of Dimitri Tiomkin's most impressionistic, elegiac and enigmatic scores. Dimitri Tiomkin's score is lush and beautifully haunting throughout. The action sequences are impressively staged. The chariot chase on the frontier road and downhill through the pines between the stoic Stephen Boyd (Livius) and a very flamboyantly psychotic Christopher Plumber (Commodus) is a highlight. Most impressive are the outstanding and unbelievable sets by production designers Veniero Colasanti and John Moore.		Director Anthony Mann has a great ability to use outdoor landscapes to full advantage enhancing the drama. He contrasts the beauty of nature with unscrupulous men's desires to control their environment through manipulation and deceit against other men of greater moral fortitude. The tranquil outdoor settings are the stage for this conflict of good and evil.  Unsung and most forgotten is producer Samuel Bronston who gave us great epic films as this. He had a penchant for producing grand epics (EL CID and 55 DAYS AT PEKING) that were not only opulent and stirring but were elevated to higher cinematic and artistic prominence for their intellect and thought provoking scripting and images.
0,This is an unusually good little horror flick, with those elements of utter wierdness that only Lovecraft adaptations seem to deliver on these days.  This one is unusal for Lovecraft in that it somewhat ties into traditional Christian mythology.		I agree the library scene was almost incongrous and some backstory would have been welcome, especially something from the original story.  But it was fairly faithful in spirit and though fairly slow in the beginning, has a truly horrific bang-up ending.  I rate this one roughly between re-animator and the recent Dagon which I also liked a lot.
0,Good picture and sound do justice to this classic UK comedy.
0,Awesome!
0,Trunks tells the story of the other's that Cell has created his own tournament where they will be fighting. Goku fought Cell but he wasn't strong enough instead it was Gohan who was strong enough. By unleashing his true power cell created little cell kids they kept own beating up his friends then Gohan got mad especially when android 16 got killed.
0,I loved his books and the movies are great, I hope they come out with more.  It is something I dreamed I could do.  as an avid outdoors person I enjoy watching the older films since they are not faked like the disney rubbish on wildlife!
0,Maybe the greatest production design ever. (I'm always amazed at the dust and trash on top of M. Emmet Walsh's office - such attention to a history of detail!) Nothing was ever the same again. And this is a beautiful re-cut. Definitely worth it.
0,This is an amazing, beautiful film. My granddaughter, aged 8, my son and I enjoyed it immensely. The music is great and it's available for purchase as a soundtrack.
0,Not only do I enjoy the cooking but Jenifer and Clarisa are so entertaining to just listen to.  They are very good cooks that really know there stuff.  I have re-watched this DVD many times.  Great entertainment.
0,Great movie. Love stories about dogs that have a good story
0,Guys, these movies are MOCKUMENTARIES. You watch them, and they want to see you get crazy and hate them. But actually I loved these films especially TRASH!! Trash is so good!!! You haters are so dumb, the way the documentaries are made with these films is that it's all raw footage, with NO MANIPULATION what's so ever!!! It's a highly realistic documentary. I think these are amazing because this is highly homo-erotic and I feel in most films there should be male nudity, I feel what Hollywood has been and is still doing is preventing male nudity which is so wrong and sexist!!		But seriously guys, these films are realistic, they want you to get the reality that's happening in front of the camera. You should at least appreciate that what you're seeing is all real except for the acting (conversation which mostly wasn't even scripted)...everything is very realistic!!! Amazing Anti-Hollywood satus quo film!!! Most films I see is always naked women and I do feel it's aweful!! We should be able to see what is being shown!5 stars!
0,A good chick-flick. Especially for Boomers!
0,Very funny movie. Wouldn't recommend for younger boys due to the nudity and some language but very funny. With cleaning it up a little, it could be a great movie to help encourage more boys to join scouting to learn some valuable life skills.
0,Great jewelry
0,LOVED this show!!!! But why isn't there a second season???
0,Awesome movie that definitely holds up over the years! So many classic lines amd just a hysterical film!
0,fun movie. The wife is a wolverine fan!
0,Outstanding story and outstanding acting.  I would rate it as a 5+.
0,This "Love for Lydia", book turned film, is done as masterfully as H. E. Bates wrote the novel. Bates was a master at depicting life in the country and this film, all 13 episodes takes one on a pleasant trip through the countryside of England, with occasional jaunts into London.  The scenery is beautiful.		H.E. Bates is also well known for "My Uncle Silas" and "The Darling Buds of May" which also have been converted to video versions. This indeed has become a Masterpiece Theatre classic.		Lydia is masterfully played by Mel Martin ("The Pallisers" & "Persuasion") giving such a performance that you can't quite decide if you love her or hate her. She seeks love, not found in her youth, after 2 decades. In the late 1920s, near her 21st birthday, she begins to become interested in men and love.  She struggles with what it is to be and how it is to be shown.  Her wealth seems of little consequence.		Young newspaperman, Edward Richardson (Christopher Blake)also a want-to-be writer, helps bashful Lydia, through the insistence of her aunts, get her skates wet and enter society of other young adults. He falls in love with Lydia, but will Lydia respond fully? Must it be unrequited love?  Richardson's friend, Alex (Jeremy Irons also of "Brideshead Revisited"), rich and always drinking, encourages Edward.  To a point!		Other friends join the trio and create a flapper-era dance group racing from one party to the next enjoyable outing. Till their worlds begin to crash, one at a time. In the end, who can survive the life-style and who will find love?  There seems to be a lot of love and lovers to pass around.		Is it drama or romance? Is it historical or period?  Perhaps all of the above.  It is an enjoyable 650 minutes done in 13 episodes that will delight any British literature fan as well as those who have come to expect excellence from Masterpiece Theatre.		Captioning would have been nice, but is not completely necessary. Make sure you buy the complete set, you will want to see the total once you get episode one started.  It's so nice having this on DVD and not being expected to wait a week between episodes.		I have read the book and watched the DVDs. I heartily recommend both.

0,a little violent but I like the action and enjoy the characters - could definitely do without the token staged sex scenes
0,Sons Of The Desert is considered to be their best feature film. I can understand why. This is definetly one of their funniest feature films. Laurel & Hardy's feature films often lack the ongoing belly laughs of their short films. Sons Of The Desert,Pack Up Your Troubles,The Devil's Brother,BlockHeads,Saps At Sea and The Big Noise are the exceptions. This movie in particular,is also one of Stan and Ollie's most entertaining films. Actor Ty Parvis's musical number"Honolulu Baby"is an unforgettable classic. Sons Of The Desert is a must see for fans of Stan and Ollie. My collection of L&H movies wouldn't be complete without this one.
0,OMG!I loved this movie!  I found it scary and loved how some shots had the cameras attached to the waist like in the show on MTV "Fear."  I absolutely love this film! I can't wait to get my own copy. The sequel is weak, but leaves room for #3!! YAY!!

0,Tender and uplifting. Very well done.
0,I love Sasha and the uniquely important work he did, and so I was happy to find this movie.  For that alone I'd give it 5 stars if it wasn't so poorly edited, i.e. too many extraneous segments that don't relate to the story.  For those who don't him and his work, this alone should make you grateful.  The FDA has approved research in using MDMA for treating PTSD that is proving to be incredibly effective in alleviating the terrible suffering that condition brings. Google it.  Also - the Through the Gateway of the Heart book has a heartful series of stories of this kind of healing.
0,Hispanic-American Rudy (Cheech Marin) is just having a fine day until an immigration raid as he's wrongfully prosecuted as an illegal immigrant. He doesn't know a word of spanish and forgot to bring his wallet and ID, he's forced to be deported to Mexico as he must find a way to get back to the U.S. even if he has to work for a club owner (Daniel Stern) for money.		Entertaining, underrated and hilarious cult comedy written and directed by Cheech Marin in based on his comedy parody album of the same name. Co-starring Paul Rodriguez, this lighthearted comedy has good laughs and an original storyline from Marin fresh off his Cheech and Chong stuff, this is one of the best and funniest comedy movies i've ever seen for i highly recommend it.		The DVD here has good picture and sound with both fullscreen and widescreen versions and one extra which is the theatrical trailer.
0,I am getting tired of righting the same sayings just so I can give you your five stars from now just to let you know all your products will get a five star rating I just won't be doing theses ratings again sorry it has to be like this
0,Other reviewers have spoken about such things as the plot in this movie, and the "competitive" aspects of two Bar Mitzvahs. Instead of repeating other reviewers, I primarily focus on more abstract matters. This comedy seems to capture the essence of the community-centered and culture-centered aspects of Jewish religious activities and rites of passage.		Imagine being a 13 year-old Jewish-American boy. Your rabbi, during the preparation for your Bar Mitzvah, teaches you things in a way that you do not fully understand. You have to learn difficult Hebrew letters. When told by your rabbi that, from now on, the sins you commit will not be laid on the parents, but will be your own, you do not feel so great. Yet you must become a man.		For one boy, the celebration he gets was extravagant. Another boy's was not so much. Still, his community came together big time. The HAVA NAGILA was sung. Benjamin was the center of attention. It was his moment of honor.

0,so far I have  season 1,2,3 ,5 only need  4.6.7 and I will be very happy with the world.  looking for them now.
0,That series works on a simple but extremely effective formula. The first characteristic is that there is only one plot going on, one investigation, as opposed to most American, and even French, detective series. That enables the episodes to go into detail a lot more and delve into intricate elements of psychology or economic interest, especially since the episodes are about one hour and thirty minutes, twice as long as standard episodes of detective series.. The second interest is that crime is always stated as being some kind of business. And that is fundamental. We think of crime as being asocial or antisocial. It is in a way, but not because it wants to disrupt and destroy society, but because it plays the rules of society in order to get an easy profit out of it. Easy? Way of speaking. Fast for sure. The pilot episode takes us into the business of undertaking and shows how that business can easily become a cover for another deadly and lethal business: heroin in exchange of diamonds, or vice versa if you prefer. "Electric Bill" is beautifully wrapped up so that the first suspect will be revealed as the culprit but after a long hesitating line of exploration and digging out. But this serial killer is only someone who is preparing the big case with little ones so that he is sure the target will pay because he will be frightened. Serial killing as an efficient business procedure. "Kiss and Tell" is funnier because a spa center is transformed into a hunting ground for a female serial killer who is only getting a lot of money out of some rich men who are looking for sexual variety and killing them when she gets the real prize. "Manic Munday" shows that sports, in that case snooker, are nothing but a business but with a lot of "agreements" and "contracts" that are little legal but much profitable for the manipulator. And you can always win when you use kidnapping and killing as a pressurizing argument. Finally "Reunion" shows how some of the clubbing and gambling business in Soho, London, are nothing but born bullies and that they are totally lost when some violence comes against them from an unknown source, when the bully becomes the prey of a vulture. Then you discover these bullies succeeded only because they killed or took advantage of the right person at the right moment in the right place to recuperate some business leverage. But when he is cornered, what's more in public he will only wet his pants, beg and cry. He will become what he always was: a capricious, whimsical child overcompensating some environmental problem by terrorizing his surroundings in order to avoid tears and wet under-wears, if not beds. But the best element of this series - and I will try to put my hand on the subsequent seasons - is that the main police investigator is systematically undercover among the criminals he is supposed to arrest sooner or later. That undercover element makes the dealing with the crime different, more interesting, more intimate even, and it is good to feel intimate with criminals: that may reassure you because criminals are just plain ordinary men and women who just want to make some dough fast. It is also true James Nesbitt is a hell of a cool investigator, as cold as an unmelting iceberg in the furnace of an incinerator.

0,I'm not sure why this only got 3 stars.  It was a very intriguing, tension-filled, and crazy the entire time.  The storyline was pretty thought provoking as well.
0,I would have given it 5 stars but I thought that at least 5 minutes could have gone into showing what happened in the 20+ years between retirement and Obamas election.

0,"A carnival of monsters living in their natural habitats in this little box of mine!"  So say Vorg, owner of a miniscope, "a unique artistic achievement, the supreme creative invention of the age."  Upon landing on the isolated Inter Minor, now undergoing a kind of glasnost under its liberal president, Zarb, the showman Vorg, resplendent in his flashy clothes, and his cute assistant Shirna, are met with hostility from the triad comprising the Aliens' Admission Commission.  There is factionalism between the three, Chairman Pletrac supporting Zarb's policies, the xenophobic and scheming Immigration Commissioner Kalik aided by the submissive Orum.  In fact Kalik becomes quite vitriolic:  "Don't talk to me about brotherhood and neighborliness!  We have survived in the past because of our strength!  Now we shall perish because of our weakness!"	Meanwhile, the Doctor and Jo take their first independent flight of the TARDIS, and instead of landing on Metebelis 3, end up on 4 June 1926, aboard the SS Bernice, en route from England to Bombay.  The Doctor senses something is wrong and he is right, as a plesiosaurus appears from the ocean.  They are captured as stowaways, but once locked in, Jo and the Doctor notices that it was 7:35 PM when they were shut in.  A few minutes later, it is 6:40 PM!  Also, it's broad daylight outside instead of dark.  The best cliffhanger is the end of Episode 1, when a giant hand plucks the TARDIS away from the SS Bernice.	By Episode 2, it's clear that the miniscope and the SS Bernice are connected, and regarding that, the Doctor marvels at the output and input lines, circuits, saying "It's like walking around inside a wristwatch," and the colourful set, with its pilars, red bulbs, shiny chrome-like walkways is a design triumph.	Another design triumph are the screaming caterpillar-like Drashigs.  As Vorg says of these ferocious monsters, "the most evil, the most vicious, and undoubtedly the most frightening form of life in the whole universe!"  They are the beasties on the cover, BTW.	Race relations is a big theme here.  On Inter Minor, there are two races, the more humanoid elite and the crude-looking and less intelligent Functionaries, who are getting more rebellious.  KKalik is worried that the Functionaries will eventually take over due to Zarb's liberal policies.  Orum says of the Functionaries, "No sense of responsibility.  Give them a hygiene chamber and they store fossil fuel in it."  And the elite refer themselves in the neutral person:  "One must do this" or "One believes that..." etc. is interesting.  Their first contact with Vorg and Shirna leads to Pletrac talking down to them:  "We give magic talk disks back.  All very good."  Shirna sarcastically tells Vorg, "You tellem tall fella we talk like him pretty good by and by."  And Vorg says of the Tellurians (Earth people) that they all look so much alike.  But Vorg's purpose to amuse ties back to the Functionaries, whose lack of entertainment is causing their rebelliousness, according to Pletrac.	A few continuity goofs:  the calendar structure aboard the SS Bernice is that of the 1925 calendar.  And the micrograph Vorg gives Pletrac is nothing more than an ordinary music cassette!  And Fred Astaire is mentioned seven years before he became famous.  Bad editing in Episode 2 leads to a previously unseen segment shown before a scene shown in Episode 1.	The supporting players are all first rate, especially Tenniel Evans as Major Daly, a typical friendly pukka sahib-type.  Ironically, Evans worked with Jon Pertwee in the British radio comedy The Navy Lark back in the 50's.  Veteran actor Leslie Dwyer (Vorg) steals the show, with firm support from Cheryl Hall (Shirna).  Ian Marter (Andrews) later became a regular in the Tom Baker Who years as Harry Sullivan.	"Our purpose is to amuse, simply amuse.  Nothing political," says Vorg.  What I hope Predator did for hunting, showing what it feels like  man to be the hunted animal, I hope Carnival Of Monsters will do for zoos.  But the concept of overcoming isolation-induced xenophobia and prejudice is key here, and despite not appearing, President Zarb is a well-felt presence due to his liberalism.  Rating:  4.5, rounded to 5.

0,These are the last stanzas in what is one of the monuments of Japanese anime, a rich fantasy story as memorable as any other notable series.  Hitomi, after fleeing Gaea back to earth finds that her experiences have left her with many unresolved feelings.  When Van flies Escaflowne across the gap between the worlds to retrieve her she joins him, even though it is to return to the middle of an horrific war.  Hitomi realizes that she can run no longer - that if Gaea is to heal, she must do her part.	By this DVD it is clear to the viewer that fate, and its changing, is the underlying theme of this series.  Isaac Newton attempts to manipulate it so that the Zaibach Empire will rule the world, nearly repeating the mistake of the Atlantean forebearers of the Gaeans.  Tarot cards reveal futures that seem inevitable.  And the intertwining of the characters defies the rules of coincidence.	Into this apparent march to cataclysmic disaster and tragedy enters Hitomi, the most atypical of anime heroines.  Thin and athletic rather than lush, cute rather than pretty, it is her inner nature rather than any physical ability that gives her the power to challenge the inevitable.  Hitomi's special skill is the power to believe.  And in doing so, she reveals that fate is far from ineluctable, that simply humans can change outcomes with their minds and hearts.	Hitomi's confusion about her feelings towards Van and Alan Schezar, her hatred of the continuous stream of violence that mars life on Gaea, and the struggle she has to accept what she can do make her a warm and accessible character to the viewer.  This is true of all the protagonists of Escaflowne, making what would otherwise be a pompous fantasy concoction into a compelling, life affirming drama.	As endings go, this one starts a bit too slowly and ends too soon.  I would have liked to see a stronger focus on the dynamics between Hitomi and Van as they realize their love for each other and must confront the roadblocks in their way.  There is room for an entire additional episode, although the movie version of Escaflowne fills in much of this touching connection between two people separated by worlds.  Even so, this is a fitting end to what has been a delightful series - one which I will always recommend without question.

0,My fiance and I have for years now talked about buying this set and finally did. It may seem like quite a bit of money to pay for it but it's well worth it. Someday this little jewel might not be available anymore so we jumped on it. Our friends envy us over it too.

0,It starts out with a brother and a sister at a cemetary, where the famous phrase "They're coming to get you Barbara" is coined. Once the brother is dispatched by a passing zombie, the sister makes her way to a seemingly abandoned house where she meets up with a black man who seems to be quite handy at boarding up doors and windows except for the most obvious ones behind him in key shots.		There's the typical idiot who decides boarding himself up with his family in the cellar is a good idea along with the usual dumb couple that blows themselves up in a truck after the boyfriend seems to forget that gas is flammable and shouldn't be splashed around a nearby lit torch. Of course there's also shots of zombies or rather people walking around aimlessly and sorta fighting to get in to munch on the people in the house.		Now while this is said to be a classic and did launch the zombie film genre it is quite boring, badly acted and not very well paced to be honest. The main actress is simply boring, the black guy is about the only halfway decent actor and everyone else is simply bad to say the least. Thankfully the guys do a fantastic job with the material, for the most part they slam this film quite well and in very funny fashion.		Some of their best riffs are aimed at the Pittsburgh natives and sports teams, also they take time to slam the midwest and the riffs they throw at the cast are gold especially those they have for the main actress who is truly a borefest. For fans of the guys, MST3K and Rifftrax this is a great addition to your DVD collection.

0,DVD  Works good.  Love this movie.  Who would have thought that Chris Rock would be this good .  Good movie.
0,Really loved the movie...Anything Dan Haggerty was a good movie, at least all the ones I saw. That is it
0,If I only knew there was a version without the narration before I got this...So the movie is cool but not phenomenal, but what they did back in the early 80s is phenomenal! However, all the atmosphere and vibe is killed by the sharp monotone narration explaining everything to you like you are 4 years old...not cool, not at all..

0,Excellent movie! Great for tweens thru adults.
0,I watched all the episodes on my Amazon Prime, which I thought only included the free two day shipping. I was watching a DVD, that I had purchased, when it was over I noticed the Amazon Prime icon on the TV,so I clicked on it with my remote.  Suddenly, I found a collection of TV shows I've never watched before. The shows that are available on "ON Demand" all have commercials, which you can't skip. Now I am able to watch episodes within their context.  What fun!  I enjoyed all episodes of Starter Wife because they were well written and the storyline has twists and humor that 'hook'.  I wish it had lasted longer.  Amazon Prime is really great for offering pilots and new series. The only frustration I have is that the networks don't continue the series after the first year.
0,Did you know that the obnoxiously humorous fat cat,. Garfield, was invented by master cartoonist Jim Davis just one year after the release of THE GOODBYE GIRl?  In interviews Davis readily admits that he borrowed the name of his feline creation from Richard Dreyfuss's character, the pushy actor Elliot Garfield, and not only the name, but his whole persona of the know it all smart aleck.  Methinks the recent animated version of GARFIELD should have used Richard Dreyfuss's voice instead of Bill Murray's.  Never mind, Dreyfuss has been laughing all the way to the bank ever since he won the Oscar at age 30 for playing the part in one of show business' most incredible and unaccountable upsets.  In Hollywood circles it has long been whispered that on that long ago Oscarcast, presenter Faye Dunaway (the previous year's Oscar winner for best actress) was feeling her oats when she blearily opened the envelope and read the wrong name as the winner.  It is said that John Travolta, who might conceivably have won the Oscar instead of Dreyfuss, has refused to speak to Dunaway ever since.		THE GOODBYE GIRL, although sluggish in places and terribly overacted by Richard Dreyfuss (although, to give him credit, he was just doing what he was supposed to do), is far from the worst Neil Simon movie of the 1970s and indeed might be the best!  In fact the success of THE GOODBYE GIRL encouraged producers to keep hiring Neil Simon for another 10 years of imitations of this formula.  If GG hadn't succeeded we might have been spared some of the treacle that was to follow, including CHAPTER TWO (where Marsha Mason marries James Caan), SEEMS LIKE OLD TIMES (with Goldie and Chevy) or ONLY WHEN I LAUGH (with Kristy McNichol playing the daughter of Marsha Mason).		Luckily in this picture the growing friendship between Marsha Mason and the 60s starlet Joan Hackett met with distaste by Mason's husband, and he divorced her ending their incredible partnership not too long afterwards.  They had a crazy streak of hits and flops together and will go down in history as the man who wrote the worst parts for an actress with a little bit of talent.  After that, for Neil Simon it was Matthew Broderick pictures and the Alec Baldwin-Kim Basinger disaster THE MARRYING MAN.  For Marsha Mason, well, there was the tragedy of Joan Hackett's untimely death, one Clint Eastwood movie in which most of her part was cut out, and a welcome return to the big screen last year in BRIDE AND PREJUDICE
0,A really fun story, with good depth of characters. I just wish there was more.
0,Loved it been looking for these for a long time
0,A deceptively simple plot will lure you into an emotionally charged, powerful and moving tale that you will NOT soon forget. This is a film about "finding yourself", confronting emotional obstacles, and intense mental anguish caused by judgemental views. But, most of all it's a film about LOVE.		A well crafted, sharply directed film with honest and heartfelt acting. Incredibly moving and unforgettable.		I loved this film.		- JM

0,"Old ghosts."  Reincarnation.  Romance.  Suspense.  A distressing pregnancy and a complicated relationship(s) make up the bulk of this drama/mystery.  I must confess I don't know why it's called The Eye 2; the first movie has no bearing on this follow-up.  This movie stands apart and can be viewed on its own.  It does, however, bring up that pesky question again, is this a horror movie or just an intense drama involving ghosts?  I'm more inclined to call it a supernatural drama; there are no frightening elements at work.  It could even be called a (one) character study.  The entire piece is driven forward by the sheer force of Shu Qi's stunning performance.  The fact that ghosts infrequently appear throughout the story does make it eerie at times but not what I'd call a full out fright-fest.  Instead, the Pang Brothers have delivered a poignant study in bad choices and not a little interference from the nether world.  This movie is intriguing, gripping, and at times agonizing to watch.  And sad to say, although I did appreciate the artistry that went into it, this is not something I could watch multiple times.  I'm glad I watched it once, but that's the extent of it, I'll never watch it again.
0,Keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time.  Tom Hanks does an outstanding job.
0,"Take Me Home" is a simple, charming, plausible story, well told.  It's not formulaic, smarmy, saccharine, or cute.  It's not rollicking, wild, or hysterical.  It's not tired, cliche-ridden, romantic rehash.  It is a fun, modestly-paced, clever, well-acted, carefully directed, clearly told, cleanly shot, elegant little comedy well worth watching.  I watched it twice, and found it consistently entertaining.

0,Ben Hur is a wonderful movie and a must have for any collection of classic films. Truly, one of the great epic films.  Also it is a Biblical epic that, sadly, even when made today is only done for TV and not the big screen.  I honestly believe the big studios don't think there is a large enough audience for a film like this anymore, but I think they would be suprised how many people would go to see a quality film like this if it were made today.  While I enjoyed the presentation on the DVD, colors are sharp, music excellent, I was dissapointed by the lack of choice in screen format. I had not bought this film already on Laserdisc because even though the widescreen is the "preferred" presentation that is far more equivalent to a theatrical presentation, some of us never saw these films in the theaters but only on TV in the scanned and cropped format. Buying both the widescreen and fullscreen laserdiscs was a hefty investment...  I had already bought two discs for "Lawrence of Arabia" and planned to eventually do the same for "Ben Hur".  Mind you it was not a case of studio double dipping.  The widecreen for "Lawrence" was a restoration released years after the fullscreen.  I waited on Ben-Hur because of the glitzy promotionals for the upcoming Digital Video Disc. DVD was supposed to have the capacity to show each movie either widescreen or fullscreen on the same disc, or even in both 70mm and Todd AO as some films were shot both ways.  As a matter of fact this extra video capacity was tooted as a big advantage, among others, over laserdiscs. So far I only have one DVD disc, "Legally Blonde" that contains both formats. I have noticed it advertised on some Warner Brothers films such as "The Lost Boys", but not many others. I realize that for a film like "Ben Hur" a lot is lost in the pan and scan "cropped format" for TV screens, but that is exactly the way I saw the movie for years on TV and I was very dissapointed not to have a disc where I could compare the two formats. I received the DVD as a gift. I was also dissatisfied with the cardboard holder of the DVD which is a bit flimsy.  Fine for a TV movie release like Salems Lot, but not for one of the great films like Ben-Hur.  I wonder if they are planning to release a box set?  I have been hearing a great deal about the studio practice of "Double-Dipping", re-releasing an enhanced version, extended version, directors cut or box set of a film only a few months to a year or so after they released it on disc for the first time.  The hope is that the same people who bought the disc, will buy it again just a short time later to get some extras not offered with the first release.  With a wonderful film like Ben-Hur anything new would be tempting to own, but this practice doesn't seem a very fair way for the movie studios to do business.  In the long run people will catch on and they may actually hesitate to buy some DVD's, even a great classic like Ben-Hur, for fear that something better is going to be released a few months later.
0,Enjoyed this series on PBS and was able to catch the full series including extras.  Highly recommend adding this to a Collection!
0,Wolf's Rain: does the title alone, by any chance, mean that the wolves are crying for some reason?  To tell you the truth, the show makes me want to cry.  The way to describe Wolf's Rain is "Stand By Me" hosing it down with "Balto" to the R-rated capacity with a hint of "Animorphs".  These descriptions didn't get to me at first, but there were other reasons why I think this anime is so involving.  Sure, "Last Exile" may have the stunning technical art design and "Witch Hunter Robin" has a complex storyline with a lovable main character, but this is one of those rare animes that, for lack of a practical term, has heart and soul.	The story takes place in a hostile future, where the people in urban-lifestyles believe that wolves were at the existent level as the Dodos for 200 years.  Not exactly.  Kiba, Hige, Tsume, and Toboe are few of the wolves that are still among the living, but in human incognito.  Kiba couldn't stand to be amongst human beings, so later when he joins the other three wolves, respectfully, he followed his nose to the flower scent as the wolves drift into the open cold field to find their eden, their "Paradise".  But later, when they found and join the flower girl Cheza to go along on their search, their one-way road trip would experience some pot holes on their way, such as a mysterious syndicate run by Darcia, army corps, and a hunter with his trusty dog whose job is to exterminated these "devils", as he calls them.	Characterization is the one thing I like so much about Wolf's Rain.  The wolves each have their own personality: Kiba is the serious, ambitious type; Hige is the laid-back, class clown of the group; Tsume is the type that doesn't care much about anything; and young Toboe is the naive type that see Tsume as his idol, as he sees him like an older brother.  Though what they are makes them distant to each other, as they travel to find Paradise, they learn how important it is to depend on each other to survive, and builds up on an interesting companionship which helps them build self-confidence and trust, which I think is what relates to the movie "Stand By Me."  While there were other characters that also play important roles to this series, Cheza is the one character that really got me looking on the greener side of the grass.  She was this angelic, calm force of nature(and literally, she IS part of nature), and she did her best to support and care for these wolves as if she was a mother to them, and I normally don't say this kind of optimism to any female anime character.  Now don't worry, this anime isn't all about one endless conversation after another, episode by episode.  Wolf's Rain has plenty of action to go well with its drama.	Did I mentioned that the people that made "Cowboy Bebop" also took part in making Wolf's Rain?  With CB's Character Designer, Producer, and Composer involved in this anime's production, these people alone are enough to convince fans to watch it.  And if it wasn't for them, Wolf's Rain wouldn't have such a wonderful constructive art design with the use of colors that add the mood to the environment and stunning wolf designs, and an eloquent musical score to top of the emotion scale.  I manage to check out the first episode dubbed, and surprisingly, Bandai did right with the casting.  Johnny Yong Bosch as Kiba, Crispin Freeman as Tsume, Joshua Seth as Hige, the English actors were on key to their Japanese counterpart.  I was skeptical when FLCL Haruko's Kari Wahlgren is going to play as the more serious Cher Degre, but after checking her vocal performance, she actually pulled it off.  When Cowboy Bebop had a great dub cast, expect the same thing here.	When people are going to see this, most are going to ask, "How can these wolves fool humans to think they are human?"  I asked myself the same question after watching half of the entire series in Japanese.  To me, after thinking about it, I don't think the question was meant to be explained, and I don't mind, because Wolf's Rain has such great qualities to consider it to be one of the best animes around.  It's not just a well-produced anime, it's also very engrossing and rewarding, too.  If you're looking for something atmospheric with heart-warming entertainment in the world of anime, you should not pass this one up.
0,awsome movie, very hard to find
0,Brittany does well here.	Ashton over acts.		Funny little story.		Adventurous, a real thought on marriage,	how does it work so well before marriage,	and not when married?		Not mature enough to handle marriage.
0,After the first Batman franchise was driven into the ground by a succession of terrible sequels, it seemed unlikely that there would ever be a respectable Batman film again. But then there came a hope from an unexpected source. Christopher Nolan (director of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Following/dp/B00000F3CD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Following</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Memento/dp/B0000640SA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Memento</a>) wanted to reinvent the character in a more realistic and epic way. He teamed up with screenwriter David S. Goyer (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Blade-Trilogy/dp/B0007WFX62/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Blade Trilogy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Dark-City/dp/B0018O4YT0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Dark City</a>) and together they wrote an exceptionally smart screenplay. The filmmakers have thoughtfully evaluated the mistakes made in the previous films (mainly poor acting, shallow characterization, campy humor and mindless action) and avoided repeating them.  They've brought a new level of depth to a genre that has recently been overexposed and streamlined. This is an intellectual superhero film. It deals with dark thematic subject matter, which is only appropriate considering that Batman is essentially a guilt-ridden vigilante who symbolically avenges the death of his parents.		The story looks at the origins of Gotham's Dark Knight. As a young boy, Bruce Wayne fell into a dilapidated well where bats attacked him. The incident would haunt him much of his life and helped to shape who he was to become. His parents, the wealthy Thomas and Martha Wayne, are altruistic and philanthropic. His father owns Wayne Enterprises, a large manufacturing company but he spends most of his time volunteering at the hospital. But one night when the Wayne family was leaving the opera, they were approached by a desperate criminal who shoots Bruce's parents. Years after their death, Bruce tries unsuccessfully to get revenge but ultimately learns that it wouldn't solve anything to perpetuate the cycle of killing. He attempts to infiltrate the criminal underworld so that he might better understand what drives people to "prey on the fearful", but he is caught stealing from his own company. He's thrown into a prison in an unnamed Asian province, where he daily fights the other inmates for "practice". A man calling himself Ducard visits him unexpectedly. He offers Bruce a "path" and suggests he joins a secret fraternity, The League of Shadows, which seeks to bring balance and sanity to the world. When he agrees he is subjected to a brutal training regiment that takes him to the breaking point. Mentally and physically exhausted, he is accepted into their ranks providing that he display his devotion to justice by executing a criminal. Bruce refuses to knowingly take a life and a great battle ensues. After barely escaping and saving Ducard from a fiery demise, he heads back to Gotham alone. He is reunited with his former girlfriend, Rachel and his parental butler, Alfred. He secretly assumes the identity of Batman. When Alfred asks, "Why bats, Master Wayne?" he responds, "Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies shared my dread." Soon Batman uncovers corruption within the police force, the legal system and even within Wayne Enterprises. But at the heart of this new crime wave is an insidious conspiracy being carried out by a psychotic psychiatrist and an old acquaintance. Ducard returns and reveals his intentions to destroy Gotham City by releasing a "fear-inducing toxin" upon the population. And only Bruce, his former apprentice can stop him from succeeding.		The film features an excellent cast featuring Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman, Michael Caine as Alfred, Liam Neeson as Ducard, Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes, Gary Oldman as Police Sergeant Jim Gordon, Cillian Murphy as Dr. Crane / The Scarecrow, Tom Wilkinson as Carmine Falcone, Rutger Hauer as Earle, Ken Watanabe as Ra's al Ghul, Linus Roache as Thomas Wayne, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox.	Arguably the best "comic book movie" ever made, Batman Begins resurrects the Dark Knight with style and sophistication. Rarely do these kinds of films touch upon philosophical beliefs, psychological disorders or social corruption and yet this film does so with ease. Batman Begins breathes new life into the legend and is the first chapter in a thrilling new Batman saga, which will be continued in 2008's The Dark Knight.

0,Great gift set with extended edition movie! If you like Lord of the Rings you have to get the extended edition of the movies. This gift set is great!
0,Not very difficult for power yoga. The sheva rea one was a better	choice and much more callenging. Good for beginners
0,One of the classic, fun films of the 80's.  Always brings smiles to our faces as we watch
0,Highly recommend this series!!!
0,I would compare this movie to like Southpark, Family Guy, most of all Beavis and Butt-Head volume 1, 2, and whatever season's they have come out with. Mike Judge is the creator of Beavis and Butt-Head. They make me laugh very hard. This seller also gave me a tracking # so that way I could keep an eye on where it was at. And the item was brand new. And there were no problems with it. I will order from this seller again. Only thing they need to change is there prices on standard shipping and expedited shipping. And stop sitting in the California state for more than 5-6 days when you order from Florida. It should really only take about 2-3-4 days at most.
0,If you like mob stories, then this is a good one. Very interesting.
0,Sam Jaeger writes, directs and stars in this romantic and believable situation comedy. This is neither overblown nor timid while costarring his own wife in the opposite lead role.  Scenery mixes with a definite palpable chemistry as these two take to the road for a trip that does not start with the happiest of farewells.		Thom (Sam Jaeger) is struggling to pay his rent. He's falling behind so he has to make money quickly.  He decides to drive a cab while living in New York City, although without proper licensing to drive it and carrying many of his possessions in his back seat.  Not having another choice, he picks up a hopeful but desperate fare in Claire.		Claire (Amber Jaeger), who is a high-powered businesswoman, catches her husband at their home in an obviously questionable situation with another woman. This woman compliments her on the "color of her bedroom" before leaving their home.  Within the same time frame, she receives a call to let her know that her father has had a heart attack and is hospitalized. These things happen just at the same time it all hits the fan with her marriage.  This causes her to run out into the street and randomly grab a cab that just so happens to be Thom.  In a "Shut up and just drive" situation, it is a go and Go Now!  The eventual destination is Encinitas, CA, but as far as Claire is concerned, anywhere would be better than where she is at the moment.		This is an easier, sometimes sarcastic, mix of a story, being more subtle than in your face as it gains momentum.  The action is slower paced and the humor comes at you at the same speed though there are some definite laughs catching one right out loud.  The couple goes from one mishap to another in some gorgeous and well shown scenery (Jesse Feldman), from the Big City to Middle America, and onward.  This is all scored with some original and snappy music by 'Bootstraps' all coming together very well for an enjoyable movie that I would absolutely watch again.
0,I really enjoy this program on TV.  It's fascinating how they find the perpetrators of the crimes!  The script is well done and the narrator's voice is easy to listen to.  They picked some good episodes although I haven't watched all of them.  If you are interested in detective work, you'll love these programs.
0,Great show.  I have enjoyed watching it again from the beginning.  It's so entertaining and fun to watch, can't wait for the new season!!!
0,A MUST FOR ALL EASTWOOD'S FANS.
0,Great film. Would highly recommend.
0,I love Sister Wendy.  She has the gift of bringing art to life.  Her knowledge is so extensive.  All of Sister Wendy's collections are excellent.  The time passes so fast when you travel with her and visit museums.
0,Excellent product, service and timely shipment. I would highly recommend!!! A+++
0,Beach Boys fans will clearly enjoy this. CUSACK is awesome, Banks is great. Never realized how key BrIan Wilson was to the  band.
0,I just found the BBC mini series, Lark Rise to Candleford. It is an excellent story of two communities, one in the country and on the city, yet the people's stories ring true, as folks travel back and forth. They have caught my heart and teach true principles of kindness, respect, hard work, forgiveness, charity. Dorcas seems to be not only the Post Mistress but the local confidant yet has her own trials of the heart. Young Laura has so much to learn as she leaves Lark Rise to begin her service as a Postal Carrier in Candleford. Good family entertainment. A must see for those who want great acting that stirs feelings of the heart and brings memories of life and learning.
0,good
0,Great movie... Will order from this seller... AGAIN....
0,Love, love, love this show. My absolute favorite is episode 1. I enjoy the character development and how relationships form and dissolve. The characters face hard choices constantly. Love blooms with the protagonists.
0,I have to admit that I am a fan of Joel McCrea, and this is one of his best westerns.  He plays Wyatt Earp, the Marshal of Wichita.  This version is in CinemaScope, which makes it even better.
0,Great acting....just three episodes a year is poor....Bernedict and Martin need more work!....still Jeremy Brett is my favorite Holmes...check out the American series...Elementary which is not bad..once you get use to the idea of Dr. Watson been a female....good acting and good scripts....
0,Quality product, no problems with any of the disca at all.
0,We watched Glenn's "Unlikely Mormon" together as a family.  It was a hit with everyone.  Our kids especially loved it.  This is a very honest portrayal of Glenn's life and we are glad we found it!
0,As good as this 1st Season of Saved By The Bell, The College Years happens to be, what bothers me is that the viewers are left hanging at the end of the 1st Season.  Zack is going to ask Kelly to marry him and Kelly excepts Zacks marrage proposal and they get married.  The only problem is that all of this and alot more occures within the 2nd Season, and they haven't yet come out with this one on to DVD, why not?  I'm still awaiting for this one to come out on to DVD;  Once the 2nd and Finial Season comes out, then I will have the entire Series of Saved By The Bell; begining with when they were in High School, and then moving onto College.  Other then that, I consider this show to being very good as well as Educational, uplifting and well done, despite the fact that the Company making up these DVD Disks had elimanated a number of eposoides from the very begining of the series from when they were back in High School!
0,Great love story.	Awesome cinematography.	Just a perfect movie.
0,Great movie
0,great great movie ! greatdeliver!
0,huh
0,Led by Chris Pratt, Guardians unleashes everything a superhero movie should be. In the same vein (without the in-your-face styling) of Deadpool, Guardians is set to be a hit franchise due to its unique approach to the (anti-) heroes involved.
0,I have all the Vision series and this is better than most.  Good music, great photo's, very interesting, enjoyed watching
0,Love Christmas, great addition to my collection
0,Dredd (HD)		 When I started watching Dredd, I was not too sure if I would like it, but  I did. It's violent, but it was not overkill. I really liked it.
0,Quick response - thanks!
0,As there are number of collections called "The Original Christmas Classics", and another called "The Original Television Christmas Classics" there can be some confusion about that is included in each set.  Particularly as they are all collections of features by Rankin/Bass (except as noted) primarily from the 1960's, and traditionally shown during the holiday season.		"The Original Christmas Classics" DVD set includes the seven features listed below, while the Bluray set with the same name, the subject of this review, only includes the first four titles.		1. Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer (1964  47 minutes)	2. Santa Claus Is Coming To Town (1970  51 minutes)	3. Frosty The Snowman (1969  25 minutes)	4. Frosty Returns (1992  23 minutes	5. Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol (1962  53 minutes)	6. Little Drummer Boy (1968  25 minutes)	7. Cricket On The Hearth (1967  49 Minutes)		The Bluray set has two video discs.  Disc One contains Santa Claus Is Coming to Town, while Disc Two features Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer, Frosty The Snowman, and Frosty Returns.  Apparently all of the features have been remastered and restored to full length.  Presentation is full screen, with no subtitles.  Some Bluray sets apparently have an audio CD with songs taken from the specials, and some do not.		Santa Claus Is Coming to Town (1970): Rating 4.5 stars	While the legend of Santa Claus may be well-known, this delightful stop action feature delves into his early years, and also explains some of the common myths regarding Santa.  The story is told partially through narration by a letter carrier (voiced by Fred Astaire) who delivers mail to Santa at the North Pole.  An orphan baby boy is taken in and raised by the Kringle's, a family of toymaking elves.  He is named Kris, and when he grows up, the red-haired young man (voiced by Mickey Rooney) leaves home with a big bag of toys.  Through the gift of giving, Kris melts the ice cold heart of the Winter Warlock (voiced by Keenan Wynn), and makes a special friend in a schoolteacher named Jessica (voiced by Robie Lester).  Kris faces numerous obstacles, but overcomes them with the help of his friends and family.  He marries Jessica, and builds a home at the North Pole.  As Santa Claus, he distributes toys to the children of the world.		The improvements made in the stop action technique, make for a smoother looking and more lifelike presentation, and the feature looks terrific on Bluray.  With a creative uplifting story and some fun songs, this wonderful take on the origin of Santa Claus, is great family entertainment.		Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer (1964): Rating 3.5 stars	A true holiday classic, Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer features Burl Ives, a warm, teddy bear of a man, lending his unforgettable voice to Sam the Snowman, the narrator of this tale.  Rudolph (voiced by Billie Richards) the son of Donner, runs away from home in shame, when his glowing red nose is discovered.  In the woods, he meets Hermey (voiced by Paul Soles), an elf who dreams of becoming a dentist.  The pair team up with prospector Yukon Cornelius (voiced by Larry D. Mann), and after escaping the clutches of the Abominable Snow Monster, they all make their way to the Island of Misfit Toys.		After growing into a young buck, Rudolph returns home, and tracks down his missing parents and friend Clarice, who are being held prisoner by the Snow Monster.  With the help of Yukon Cornelius and Hermy, the Snow Monster is defeated, and the prisoners are set free.  A raging storm threatens to ruin Christmas, but with Rudolph leading the sleigh team, Santa is able to deliver presents after all.		Memorable characters, an underlying message of acceptance, and quality songs, particularly those sung by Burl Ives, pretty much insures that this will continue to be a beloved holiday classic.  The Bluray image is reasonably sharp and blemish free.		Frosty The Snowman (1969): Rating 3 stars	This animated feature narrated by Jimmy Durante, tells the story of Frosty, who comes to life when the magical hat of Professor Hinkle (voiced by Billy De Wolf) lands on his head.  Together with his new friend Karen and Hinkle's rabbit Hocus Pocus, Frosty sneaks aboard a train headed north.  The trio ends up in the woods, with Hinkle trailing trying to retrieve his hat.  Fortunately Santa arrives to save the day, returning Karen home, and taking Frosty with him to the North Pole.  Based on the traditional song, Frosty The Snowman is a light and fun tale, probably best suited for young ones.  The Bluray looks fine, but probably won't blow you away.		Frosty Returns (1992): Rating 2.5 stars	This animated special was produced by CBS rather than Rankin/Bass, and features narration by Jonathan Winters.  Frosty arrives in the town of Beansboro, and becomes friends with children Holly and Charles.  A new invention called Summer Wheeze, a canned spray that instantly melts snow, threatens to ruin the town's traditional winter carnival.  John Goodman provides the voice of Frosty.  Image quality is just average.		Whether this Bluray collection with just four features is a better buy than Rankin/Bass'&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Original-Christmas-Classics-Rudolph-the-Red-Nosed-Reindeer-Santa-Claus-Is-Comin-to-Town-Frosty-the-Snowman-Frosty-Returns-Mr-Magoo-s-Christmas-Carol-Little-Drummer-Boy-Cricket-on-the-Hearth/dp/B000R7G6JA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Original Christmas Classics (Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer / Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town / Frosty the Snowman / Frosty Returns / Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol / Little Drummer Boy / Cricket on the Hearth)</a>, or&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Original-Television-Christmas-Classics-Rudolph-the-Red-Nosed-Reindeer-Santa-Claus-Is-Comin-to-Town-Frosty-the-Snowman-Frosty-Returns-The-Little-Drummer-Boy/dp/B0002I82Z0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Original Television Christmas Classics (Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer / Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town / Frosty the Snowman / Frosty Returns / The Little Drummer Boy)</a>, both which have more content, just depends.  The remastered stop action features look very good in high definition, however the animated ones seems just average.  Unless you are totally in love with Rudolph, and Santa Claus Is Coming To Town, one of the DVD collections might work out better.		If you do have a warm spot in your heart for holiday programming, you will want to at least take a look at all the options.  With so many similar products, some with the same name, it is easy to get confused, and Rankin/Bass probably needs to do a better job of making it clear to consumers just what they are buying.
0,DVD arrived in excellent quality and condition. DVD arrived in a very timely  fashion.
0,I watched this show growing up. Brings back memories. The quality of the Dvds are good. Looks really good on my 60 inch led 1080p tv.
0,White (Krzysztof Kieslowski, 1994)		When I mentioned to people that I was in the midst of watching Three Colours, Kieslowski's celebrated film trilogy, for the first time, to a person, I got the same reaction: "oh, Blue is my favorite of the three, but the other two are really good as well!" Of course, if you've been following along, you know me: if there's a sacred cow around, I have an overwhelming urge to turn it into shish-kebab, and that may be part of the reason that, now that I've given myself a few weeks' perspective from all three films, I've landed on White as my favorite of the three. But it could also be that White is the film that, in some odd way that I can't quite put my finger on, most reminded me of Dekalog, my favorite Kieslowski offering. Even though Blue has the most surface connection to Dekalog, White has a great deal of that same mindset going on under the hood. Kieskowski's masterful morality play would have fit right in with Dekalog, I think.		The wonderfully-named Karol Karol (The Call of the Toad's Zbigniew Zamachowski) is a Polish expatriate barely getting by in Paris. His lovely young wife Dominique (Killing Zoe's Julie Delpy) has just divorced him after only six months, and he finds himself homeless. While playing a comb in the metro to pick up spare change, he meets Mikolaj (Aquarium's Janusz Gajos), a wealthy Polish businessman who wants Karol to come back to Poland with him to perform a service (saying what would be a spoiler). Things turn out unexpectedly in Poland, and Karol, who has never forgotten Dominique's betrayal, alternately tries to go on with his life without her and concocts absurd schemes to win her back.		I think one of the reasons I liked White more than the other two films is that, of the Kieslowski works I've seen (all the major films at this point, and a few of the shorts-- not nearly as many as I'd like), it's the out-and-out funniest; it requires a warped sense of humor, to be sure, but Karol is without doubt meant to be a comic figure, and Zamachowski's hapless portrayal is spot-on. Karol never feels entirely comfortable in his skin, whether he's on top of the world or at the bottom of the trash heap, and it's Zamachowski's excellent portrayal of Karol that makes this film a success as much as it is Kieslowski's impressive directorial skills. Whereas Juliette Binoche's character in Blue was never less than self-assured, even when she was entirely lost, Karol is her opposite; he's never self-assured even when he's most found. And yet neither Zamachowski nor Kieslowski ever overplay their hands; Karol is usually at least sympathetic, if not outright pathetic, but Zamachowski does it so well that even the well-worn clich that forms the final movement of the film comes off as fresh and inviting.		White is Kieslowski at his finest, easily on a par with episodes five and seven of Dekalog. I cannot recommend the films of Kieslowski highly enough, if you haven't already experienced them; while I'd suggest starting with Dekalog, it does represent a serious chunk of time, and Three Colours gives you a taste of the genius without having to invest eleven hours and change. ****
0,Great cast, full of well known stars, very funny.
0,I really enjoy this show it's fun to watch I like when their then case connects with an old vegas case.
0,Wonderful, absolutely fantastic DVD.  Monty Python's crowning achievement in silliness is given fantastic treatment here and makes good use of it.  The behind the scenes bits are very interesting and quite funny.  The archives of the artwork and sketches are a nice inclusion, but it would have been nice if they were bigger or could be zoomed in on.  Maybe I'm missing a button somewhere.	The original trailers were brilliant and I had never viewed them before so it was great seeing them for the first time.	The movie itself looks great and should be standard issue for all mental hospitals or places where people are treated for depression.  Unstoppable giddiness is really the best way I can describe it.	There are some DVD's that you can be content to rent once or every so often.  The Holy Grail is a DVD that really must be owned.  No matter what awful events are happening in your life, this silly tale will certainly allow you to look on the bright side of life.	Just pop it in to see a scene or two, you'll feel better in no time.	Now go away, or I shall taunt you a second time!
0,I remember this whole story when I was in my 20's and didn't really think much, considering I lived in St. Louis at the time.  To me this was just the same old things I heard from my transplanted New Yorker Friends. That corruption in every aspect ran wild in NYC.  Not just the law, but in business as well.  Some 20+ years later I was astonished at how this whole thing played out.  The filmed statements from the 5 men were especially telling to me.  It is sad that these men lost years of their lives and are forever branded for the rest of their lives, while the law enforcement and judicial personel involved lived their lives with no remorse. It just amazes me how these people can sleep at night.
0,I thought this movie was a great prequel to the Robin Hood saga. Since there is no actual proof that Robin Hood was real, the story itself can have a bit of flexibility. And I thought this was a great interpretation of what drove Robin Hood into the robbing business. I would have liked to have seen more new scenes added in this director's cut, especially between Robin and Marian. But still, a great movie.  The scenery was beautiful and the life of the people seemed very realistic.		My only complaint is that on my blu-ray player, if I hit pause, when I come back I have to start the movie over (search for the scene). My son also bought it and he had a similar experience. The dvd played fine, so I guess I'll just watch that unless I can set a couple of hours aside with no interruptions. Ha! Did anyone else have this problem?
0,I read a reviewer say that this is the best family movie of all time.  And it might be.  If you love dogs.  This isn't sad like Old Yeller.  It's just a little movie filmed in Denton Texas about a dog who rams all over town.  And knows where to stop and get food.  He always stops at one house with two kids a brother and a sister.  Who want to keep him.  But their Father won't let them.  The kids get kidnapped by some not too menacing bad guys.  And as the movie goes along Benji leads the police to the kidnappers.  And the Father changes his mind.  You really have to see this movie to know how good it really is.
0,Really rhe only thing that made this a bit corny was the evil aliens (and also their evil animal "pets"), but even they weren't really SOOO bad.  Also, the reason why the aliens can only kill them IN ORDER was not explained.  The movie was good if you focus on the interaction between the characters.		The setting is that this teenager is unique & important to the world, and he's hiding out trying to grow up like a normal boy in high school.  He has to deal with all the hard-ships of being "different/special" from the all mundane kids.  In this way, the setting kinda resembles the high-school-age Clark Kent in Smallville or the teenage John Connor from Terminator Sarah Connor Chronicles.		I liked it.
0,Hilarious comedy movie with a nod to the low-budget horror genre.
0,Just can't go wrong with this whole series. Can't wait to buy season 11, and hope they continue to make them.	The Blue Frog Man!!!!!
0,Very cute movie with great family humor.
0,Whatever you thought this movie is about, the ending will surely comes as a large surprise to most of you. I knew what the choice would be, maybe you will also before it  ends!
0,I rented this movie primarily because I like the original Saints & Soldiers so much, and I read a few good reviews of this sequel.  And I was not disappointed!  This is a powerful story of combat in Southern France (August,1944) right after the Allied invasion of that area (Operation Dragoon).  It follows several paratroopers as they gradually find each other in enemy territory.  There are many plot twists and various scenes that are intense and riveting!  But most of all, it was told in a very human perspective from BOTH SIDES, and really illustrates the depravity and nobleness of men in ways that I will not soon forget!
0,2nd Round see first review
0,This story takes place in a school in England. The unconventional assistant teacher, the new teacher and the children decide to head to Wales for a competition. The competition involves writing and singing an original song for Christmas.		The children and the adults embark on a driving experience which is quite an adventure and you wonder if they will arrive at the castle where the competition is being held, in time for the song fest.  Be assured they do but with many challenges and opportunities to problem solve along the way.		There are funny moments but also moments where you see families connect in a new understanding of each other. You will see the "underdog" rise to the occasion and meet the challenges of the trip and competition and then there is the surprise ending in the stable on Christmas night.		This is a family movie. The beginning may be a bit confusing but as it progresses , you will become involved in the momentum of the children and the adults singing their way to the end.		*I received a copy of this for review - all opinions are my own*
0,Season 2 is every bit as good as season 1.
0,A thoughtful movie outside the box, very well done and so British.  What more can you ask for.
0,I feel like the characters were my friends.
0,I am a real Dilbert fan and the animated series is a load of laughs - this DVD brings you more than you will ever need of our favorite nerd and his adventures through a crazy business world, that often seems too close to reality!  I strongly recommend this DVD.
0,Good
0,Saw all these movies.  The Mummy 1932 is one of the best, but the rest are so entertaining. It's wonderful to have these back in my home as I enjoyed them so when I was a child.  Even better now.  Get them, you won't be disappointed if you are a fan of old horror and sci-fi.
0,Another great season with more great stories. The characters are the same with little detail about their lives. There is one particular episode that is not worth anyone's watching. It is gross and very disgusting. It is called Sons and Daughters. Other than this one episode I can recommend this tv series.
0,I bought this video looking to bring my workout up a notch and boy did I get what I was looking for.  The band adds a great deal of intensity and her infusion of ballet with pilates created a unique spin making it unlike any of my other dvds.  If you looking for a total body burn that challenges your entire body press play for all five 10 minute sessions.  Some of the moves are pretty hard to do correctly so I would recommend watching the workout through before doing them for the first time. Overall I am very happy with my purchase.
0,Enjoyable movie. Very fast service
0,All I want to say about Daredevil was that it was a fun hour and 40 minutes. I'm a DD fan and I had my reservations about this movie going in, and especially after the first 20 minutes which I think went by a bit slow. But once this movie got itself into the main plot with all the DD character staples it was just great. The movie went by in no time and I found myself wanting to see it again, which is abnormal for me. While it may not be as good as Spider-man, if only for its slow beginning, this film is easily one of the most fun I've seen for a long time.
0,If you love zombies and your a fan of "Mystery Science Theater 3000" then you must have this!  The commentary is hilarious and of course the movie is great.		I would gladly recommend this to a friend.
0,this is about 2 kids in a hospital for kids with illnesses.  there is nudity.  see in the movie the 2 main kids are in bubbles.  and they learn how to get out.  and play any where that it is not the bubble.  this is a good movie.
0,love this movie - Sidney is great
0,Great actors and enjoy Alfred Hitchcock
0,I was a big fan of Lucy Lawless in Xena: Warrior Princess so Spartacus was appealing to from the start. I wasn't a huge fan of Spartacus at first because I thought it was too slow in the scenes that weren't action orientated. While Andy Whitfield's charisma was certainly missed, I thought Gods of the Arena was an overall improvement on Blood and Sand.		What really made Gods of the Arena was the increased focus on the characters. It took a little while to get accustomed to the kind of storytelling that Blood and Sand used, but you really get a feel for the characters in this one.		John Hannah and Lawless make this prequel well worth your while. I don't generally like prequels and this looked like a load of filler from the start, but that ended up not being the case. The writers got over the loss of their lead actor, which generally cripples shows.		If you liked Blood and Sand, you'll love Gods of the Arena. If you haven't seen Blood and Sand, I still think there's something to be enjoyed about this series. It's an overall better series which might enhance your enjoyment of the first one.
0,pretty much what I expected from this movie but the plot was a familiar one
0,Great for all ages and is cute and funny at the same time
0,Good movie
0,I purchased the first Six Seasons of this remarkable and most importantly one of the best written and directed shows ever to grace television. The actors in this series are superb and the characters in which they play are as complex as the stories they portray. I without a doubt recommend Season Seven Part I to add to this magnificent series, which is in it's final and last season. It will not disappoint. While we all wait for the conclusion you will need this DVD to proceed to the final act.
0,This is the season I've been waiting for!!! The fifth season is when The Jeffersons really hit it's stride!!! Wow! There are so many fantastic episodes like when Florence gets to meet Billy Dee Williams. Needless to say she was truly his number one fan, considering he later guest-starred on an episode of her sitcom 227. Hint, Hint the second season release of that series is Long Overdue!!!		I'd have to say one of my all-time favorite episodes is when George and Helen get Disco Fever!!! I just loved watching George dance, but poor Tom Willis got a raw deal having absolutely no rhythm on the dance floor! I could go on and on about many more favorite episodes from this unforgettable fifth season, but I'll just wait with great anticipation until August 15th!!!!! Now only if Sony will get cracking with a complete first season release of Maude my life would be complete!!!!!
0,Based on a combination of two original ideas from the late Gene Roddenberry,Andromeda gives us another unique take on the Sci-Fi universe,and a wonderful trip it is.	There are so many plot turns and twists in this five year,110 ep show,that it is impossible in the space provided here to give you a proper synopsis of the show in any great detail.	The series story is based around the rescuing of the star ship Andromeda and its'Captain,Dylan Hunt,from the event horizon of a black hole. 300 years have gone by and the Commonwealth that he served during his lifetime has now fallen to two main factions,Nietzscheans and the Magog. Dylan sets out,with the help of the crew that rescued him,to restore the Commonwealth...quite the monumental task. That crew is made up of one Bekka Valentine(the captain of her own ship the Eureeka Maru),Tyr Anastazi(a Nietzschean),Trance Gemini(species unknown-purple,with a tail!),Rev Bem(a Magog seeking enlightenment and the true path)and Seamus Harper the genius with the wise cracking attitude(like a smart Morey Amsterdam).Along with the important main plots that move each show and the story arc along are the many sub plots involving each crew member and how their lives past,present and future, effect and fit into the entire puzzle. The story arc in toto is a gloriously rich tapestry of human endeavour and of good trying to triumph over evil,and some of the story line's journeys simply amaze. It is a smartly written series and the CGI effects throughout the series are nothing less than spectacular. Kevin Sorbo who plays Capt. Dylan Hunt is an extremely likable actor and plays his character with much elan and pinache. He is the star but that it is an ensemble work there is no doubt. Mr. Sorbo is always there and hits his marks and really anchors the show when it's most needed but the shows' main strength is what every actor in this show brings to the table...and none of them at any time fail to disappoint. There may be eps that are better than others,which is de rigeur of ANY show Sci-Fi or otherwise,but the acting throughout this series is first class all the way.	The shows themselves were shot on a no more than SIX day shooting schedule and sometimes were completed in FOUR! Budgets were apparently very tight throughout this series shooting which is all the more amazing when you look at the finished product. This was a Cadillac show produced on a Volkswagen budget. The show was shot in Vancouver,B.C. and from what little of the special features in this set I've seen there is consistently high praise for the crew and staff by the actors and production staff behind the cameras. And speaking of special features this set is packed with them. I do not believe there is anything that has been left out. You will learn everything about specific sets,set ups,make up,the camera crew,the producers and directors,the music and on and on and on. My favourites are the multi blooper reels for the crew in general,each crew member and even special guest stars! All 110 eps along with their trailers are here and in beautifully transferred(clean and crisp) widescreen formats.	This show was co-backed by Tribune Entertainment(U.S.) and Global-CanWest(Canada) which ran concurrently on both their respective networks. Global treated their product with what I can only describe as sheer neglect and disinterest. They ran the show on a fairly consistent basis for about the first two years in a regular time slot. After this Andromeda's appearances on the network were sporadic at best. You just never knew when and where the show would surface on its' schedule as it would preempt it for(it seemed) the local weather report! And of course they would never tell you why it was not showing or when it would reappear. I eventually gave up about a quarter of the way through the fourth season because I had totally missed so many eps of the third season. I understand now that Global was reluctant to carry on with Andromeda past the fourth year. It was only Tribunes' insistence that won the day. Thank goodness someone had the guts and vision to take it further.	I am glad also to see this set is now available on both Amazon.com and .ca. I however had to get my set from another source than Amazon. A few months back I did try to order it from Amazon.com when it was available. However a couple of months later(no explanation has ever been forthcoming) I was no nearer to getting a copy than before so I had to cancel my order. By this time Amazon.ca had also run out of copies so I ordered the first season set only from them. It was defective!(my luck).I returned that. So I got my set from elsewhere and my luck again there was a defect in some of the first season disks. I phoned ADV video in Texas which makes and distributes this set and got one Lisa,in the customer service department there. She,with no questions,sent me replacement discs for the set. Absolutely wonderful service. So if anyone ever has a problem that can't be resolved through Amazon(which is RARE!)then by all means contact Lisa at ADV Ent.(1-800-282-7202,ext#1).It's an extra bit of peace of mind to know that not only are you dealing with one of the best consumer oriented companies around in Amazon.ca. and .com,but also the very makers of the product you are buying!	In conclusion no fan of this show or of just good,intelligent and smartly written series in general,will be disappointed in their choice to buy this set. With 110 eps packed into 50 discs(two to a thin pack-less chance of damage),filled to the brim with special features and in their gloriously transferred widescreen format,Andromeda will not fail on any level to disappoint. Get your copy today and take your private journey with Dylan Hunt and his crew.
0,This is the question Alphonse (Jean-Pierre Leaud) keeps asking all the male characters in the film, trying to find the meaning of women, as he hopes to figure out his own relationship with the script-girl, who has just been found kissing the movie's stills guy.  Ahhh, but then he finds the luscious Jacqueline Bisset, who is at odds and struggling with her own relationship with a wealthy older American.  While this movie is about making movies, it still revisists Truffaut's main theme in most of his films: the relationships between men and women.		A brilliant movie by a brilliant director (the best, actually).  The opening one minute tracking shot of the "movie within the movie" emptiomizes Truffaut's own unique style: a bus zooms by as we seemingly focus on the main character? A woman dressed in red walking a busy street? No.... an elderly couple walking their dog? No... Jean-Pierre Leaud coming up the steps of a subway stop? No... a red convertible pulling up and parking?  Still no... but alas, after nearly one full minute of the camera looping around this busy Parisian street, we finally land on the intended main character of the scene, Jean-Pierre Aumont, as he gets slapped by an approaching Jean-Pierre Leaud.  This opening sequence sets the tone for a truly original film about film.		I love the camera style of Truffaut, where either at the beginning of a scene, or in most cases after it, he will pan off of the main characters or action, and sneakingly dwell on some other non-significant character or scenery.		Even though we don't make movies like they used to in 1972, this is still a fascinating look into the movie making world of the time, with all it's facets, responsiblities, and relationships. Very humorous at times, it is a true pleasure to sit back and enjoy this Oscar winning film, from a director who is unequaled in the history of films.
0,This is the third time I have watched the movie series and I still find something I missed.  it captures the human side of war with real people giving their side of it from the GI's who actually lived it. You need to watch it more than once to get the feelings of the men in it. Outstanding!
0,This was a surprisingly good movie. I enjoyed Simon Pegg in Hot Fuzz, which I thought was better than this movie, but I still enjoyed this one. It is a typical underdog story with a lot of laughs included. This is definately a good renter but would be a good addtion to your collection if you liked Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz.
0,funny show
0,It was a good ole time movie.
0,Love it!
0,Very entertaining popcorn film.  Great pacing, good plot, great cast.  Scary but not bloody.
0,Have seen it before, but tried to watch it again, and my connection kept failing
0,Should have been an OSCAR nominee (and winner) without a doubt. One of Hanks' very best films. One scene alone should have been enough for the Oscar nod. Cannot recall watching and enjoying any movie more than this one in the past year.
0,Added to collection.
0,Seniors having the courage to reinvent themselves - each listened to their own intuition and created a new life with purpose. A must watch fim over and over as there are multiple lessons each character presents.
0,Based on a real life story. Well done by all of the actors and the director. Worth watching.
0,Excellent bible movies!!  My daughter loves them and she is highly entertained by them and now asks so many questions about the bible which is forcing me to be better versed on these areas of the bible.
0,Yes
0,This was a deal of the day purchase - so it was an especially good buy.  If you like fantasy films this is the set for you.  The original film with Charlton Heston is a classic.  The subsequent films in the series, while not as good, are still very entertaining.  That the set also included the remake with Mark Wahlberg as well as the recent "Rise of the Planet of the Apes" made for a great package.  Highly recommended
0,Great
0,This is a very good movie, a man is sent out to deal with a former Nazi. This man has dementia and it is heartbreaking at times that he cannot remember what he is supposed to be doing. The ending is a real shocker. Remember the word and title, "Remember".
0,My kids had never seen this - they liked it.
0,omg...if you loved seeing Jennifer and Clarissa on tv...  you got to own this. ive waited for... what .... nearly 10 years for this series to finally come out on dvd. and im loving every minute of it. i think you will too. and the last dvd has a wonderful memorial of Jennifer Patterson's life that was amazing, facinating, and funny... God bless her!
0,Really good movie...surprise ending.  I always enjoy Richard Gere.  Good job by Topher Grace.  What else must I say?	Fast paced, good graphics, suspense, etc.
0,If I had owned a copy of this when I was like 12 years old, I would've watched this everyday for like a week straight. This film has a sorceress that walks around buck naked the entire film, sword play, friggin lasers and sh*#, and weirdo post apocalyptic ghouls, not to mention the guiding hand of Lucio Fulci (the master of trippy visuals). Honestly one of Fulci's most enjoyable films.
0,It's about time. After 10 or more years someone finally put this crazy and totally awsome show on dvd with more than just 4 episodes. I am a huge fan of Bobobo-bo. The best Anime with comedy and makes fun of other Anime as well. If you like slap stick, nutty, and stuff that just doesn't make sence at all, then you will love this. A first hero that uses his nose hairs as whips and listens to his nose hairs for battle, is one great comedy. You have to see it to believe it. This Bobobo-bo fights a guy called Baldy Bald a man who goes and tries to cut everones hair as one of his evil plans is wierd enough. But theres more to it than that. Theres tons of crazy heroes that helps him fight all these crazy battles along the way, and even weirder ones that becomes his side kicks. Once again, you have to see it to believe it.
0,My wife and I absolutely love both the Purge movies. In an effort not to give away much here (you can read summaries on the production description page), I will briefly say that the blu ray looks and sounds great just like when we saw the move in the theatre. We were hoping for an "unrated version" of this film seeing the obvious topic and content. Otherwise, a must buy.
0,R. Kelly is my favorite R&B / Soul singer. Trapped in the closet is sooooo brilliantly done with singing the whole time. It was like I was at a wonderful musical comedy show. I love Pimp Luscious and the many other characters that R. Kelly played. Amazing!	Great Job R. Kelly!	Thanks for this DVD. I support R. Kelly 200%
0,Great TV show

0,I first watched this on Netflix, and watched it a few times more later, and decided I had to buy it. It is a riveting, eye opening, uplifting documentary that is definitely worth watching!
0,Very absorbing and also comical movie.
0,American, Susie Banion, has just started at the prestigious Tam Dance Academy in Switzerland, but something isn't quite right. On the day she arrives, one of her fellow pupils is murdered, and in the weeks that follow a number of strange occurrences happen. Could it be that the dance academy is really run by a coven of witches? Why would a coven of witches even want to run a dance academy in the first place?		Along with Dario Argento's previous film, "Deep Red", "Suspiria" is considered to one of Argento's masterpieces. I recently watched both films, one after the other, and in my opinion, although "Deep Red" has the better plot ("Suspiria" is barely coherent at times), visually, "Suspiria" is the better film. Dario Argento is renowned for making some of the most visually stunning horror movies of all time (this man can make a gory murder a thing of beauty) and in "Suspiria" he has some of the most visually stylish shots of his career and of any film that I have ever seen. "Suspiria" also has a chilling score, written by the Goblins, that perfectly sets the scene and is my favourite score of all time.		"Suspiria" is the first film in Argento's "The Three Mothers" trilogy, the second film being "Inferno", and the third film being the recently released "Mother of Tears", which was made 30 years after "Suspiria".
0,Damon was great
0,Probably the best live-action Disney film i've EVER seen !!!	Some of the greatest actors of the 90's like Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, Chris O'Donnell and many more are at the top of there game in this very cool, action-packed and hilarious, live-action Disney picture. The film is supported by a good storyline, great music and a some nice historical setting which makes the film beautiful to watch. I would definitely recommend this film to everyone. It's a MUST SEE !
0,Great espionage.
0,For those not familiar with his work, Terence Davies (The Long Day Closes, Neon Bible) is more of a painter than a filmmaker, he just happens to use movies as his paint medium! So, in 'Distant Voices/Still Lives' we have a 'painterly' representation of a working-class family in Liverpool circa 1960. The story is told through the thoughts and memories of the various family members, all with different perspectives.	In my subject line, I call this movie a musical. That's because there are many scenes of the characters in pubs or at home, bursting into song, and usually the choice of song reflects the person's feelings at that moment. But these are not sequences like those you see in Musicals. There's no instrumental backing, the people are just singing out loud  for their own entertainment & to offset the grim 'kitchen sink' reality of their family life.	I'd like to add that although Freda Dowie is listed as the star (and she IS a standout as the Mum), another actor who may be more familiar is the father, played by Pete Postlethwaite (Romeo + Juliet, Brassed Off). Although his character is frighteningly unsympathetic, it is a wonderful performance.	So, all in all, probably not everyone's cup of tea, but worth the effort if you want a riveting artistic & emotional experience.
0,A fun fantasy, not to be taken seriously. Will probably become a cult classic one day. It reminds me of "John Cater" a little bit. Must see for"B Movie" science film fans.
0,Valkyrie is a movie based on the true story of the 1944 plot by German army officers to assassinate Adolf Hitler. Starring Tom Cruise, the film contains all of the necessary elements for successful cinema: good acting, a worthy plot and suspenseful drama. Despite knowing of the ultimate failure of the assassination plot, the movie still is able to hold the audience in rapt attention.		The movie begins when Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) is injured while fighting Allied forces in northern Africa. Losing an arm and an eye in the attack, Stauffenberg is sent back to Berlin as an officer in the German army reserves. There he becomes involved in a plot to assassinate Hitler and overthrow the Nazi government so that peace can be brokered with the Allies. After several failed attempts, Stauffenberg succeeds to detonate a bomb in a situation room where Hitler is briefing his top generals. Believing Hitler to be dead, Stauffenberg races back to Berlin while his co-conspirators seizes control of the German reserve army and order them to arrest all SS troops, falsely accusing them of killing Hitler. The coup begins to succeed but falls apart when Hitler makes a national broadcast to prove he was still alive.		Spoiler Alert!!!		The SS troops are released from prison and surround the conspirators' headquarters where Stauffenberg and his accomplices are summarily executed.		End Spoiler Alert!!!		Cruise does an excellent job of portraying Colonel Stauffenberg and turns in one of the better performances of his career. The movie is actually remarkably historically accurate, as far as it goes, and truthfully relates the events almost exactly as they transpired. One can't help but wonder how different history could have turned out if the bomb Stauffenberg detonated had succeeded in killing Hitler or if the Valkyrie coup had succeeded in overthrowing the Nazi government. There are several moments in the movie where you realize if people involved in the Valkyrie plot had faithfully carried out their part in the coup, things might have turned out quite differently.		I consider the film's criticism for not showcasing German accents to be minor and unrelated to the quality of the film.		I appreciate the movie's attempt to convey the courage and moral fortitude these German soldiers displayed to actually move forward with a plot to assassinate their country's leader. They recognized that in order to be a "good German" they had to stop the "bad Germans." Though it was unquestionably the right thing to do and a valiant attempt to save lives, the officers involved still had to make several tough decisions along the way, knowing that if they failed in their attempts they faced certain torture and death.		Many have pointed out, correctly, that Stauffenberg and his co-conspirators at first supported Hitler when he first rose to power.  This is true, yet they still deserve credit for realizing their errors and attempting to atone for their mistakes, even if it was belated.		The movie only briefly alludes to Stauffenberg's devout Catholicism which undoubtedly paid a pivotal role in his decision to oppose Hitler. Though the movie does not mention it, Stauffenberg was also a member of German nobility. This is interesting only because those who were most prone to opposing Hitler were either the Christians, German aristocracy or the capitalists. Thus Stauffenberg met two of these characteristics. Though it is shamefully nearly forgotten today, the Nazis were a radical left-wing socialist movement and publicized themselves as a worker party.
0,I love Stargate! The show has everything I am looking for Sci-fi, drama, mystery, comedy, a small amount of romance, and adventure all tossed together in one show. I call that AWESOME! I have been a fan since it started in 1997 and I re-watch them at least once a year. This was a great movie to tie up the loose ends of a Great Show!
0,I'm so pleased that this wonderful show will be available to enjoy again; I only saw a few episodes because our affiiate in Milwaukee bowed to the protests of a small few, and it was taken off. It's been a while, but I remember Aidan Quinn giving a fine interpretation of a conflicted man; a just and right and Christian man, facing issues that affect all of society. Also, a family man, with those profound concerns as an added challenge. As I recall, Jesus Christ had conversations with him, and this seemed to offend some closed-minded fundamentalist types. What I found intriguing was that we all like to think of our own clergymen as having some kind of connection to the Lord. Clergymen pray, and all this show portrayed was a clergyman's converations with the Lord, and his interpretation. Apparently, anyone who didn't appreciate "The Book of Daniel" are those who don't believe in prayer or their clergymen. Anyone who thinks that Jesus Christ isn't with us all the time shouldn't call himself a Christian. If the fundamentalists are offended by this show, then I'm offended by their idiot, closed-minded approach to spirituality. This show must have been especially interesting to the agnostics, if only for it's soft approach to a touchy subject matter. I write this with absolute respect to other religions, but encourage them to witness a well-written show, rife with humor as well as serious subject matter, to know that no one, even a clergyman, has all the answers, and that the Lord, whatever you may call him, is always there and it's comforting to know that we're not alone. We're also not alone with a brilliant cast and writing staff, that attempted to portray life and its foibles with aplomb and generous amounts of common sense. If you don't like it, don't watch it. How hard is that to understand...?  I particularly liked the idea that Jesus was portrayed with a sense of humor; the doom & gloom fundamentalists can stew in their virtue. Let the (majority) rest of us alone.
0,Ordered this for my 10 year old's birthday and we all love it. Has some fun episodes. He has watched the season and has gone back to watch several of the episodes again.
0,If I had viewed this beautifully filmed version of TESS without knowing who the director was, never in my wildest dreams would I have guessed it was Roman Polanski! It is very different from his other films. Of course Polanski is a versitile director. Anyone who could go from THE TENANT to FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS (a masterpiece of the comedy-horror genre) has got to be multifaceted artistically. Reading the negative reviews of TESS confirmed the opinion that many Amazon reviewers react more emotionally than rationally. TESS is totally UNLIKE any other Polanski production.		It's more BBC's Masterpiece Theatre than ROSEMARY'S BABY.		Nastassia Kinski is, of course, physically beautiful, but it is her "inner self" that captivates in the film. Her Tess is so completely understated--and this is where other reviewers may have a problem with this production--as to be ephemeral. Despite her beauty there is an illusive quality to the characterization. She's more spirit than flesh & blood. It's as if Tess advances through life with the forgone (perhaps, subconcious) conclusion of being ultimately doomed. This is so close to Thomas Hardy's vision of fate, that I'm surprised most negative reviewers either missed it or just didn't want to see because they had a pre-existing bias against Polanski. This isn't the place to go into RP's legal woes; suffice it to say that he was more set-up than predatory.		I thought the script still needed some work in showing motivation. I agree with reviwers who felt details of Tess' relationship are too truncated. For example, the whole "baby thing" happens so fast, it's almost like Tess never had a baby. However, this may be part of Polanski's intent on not wanting the audience to wallow in wet, 3 hanky emotion--a feature that overall I appreciated. He didn't want to create a melodrama bloated with nudity & sex scenes.		In ways--some obvious, some not so obvious--TESS reminded me of ELIVRA MADIGAN, another impressionistic style film about a compellingly strange & doomed heroine.		Here's a little heretical hint: The TESS I screened was a 1 Disk Director's Cut version available from Netflix--and, despite being passed around like a village hussy, it was in a spotlessly pristine condition with outstanding cinematography & exhibited none of the problems some reviewers complained about. It would be nice if there was more consistency in the film reproduction industry.

0,As a Trekkie and Trekker, I sometimes feel guilty about my impressions of different incarnations of Star Trek.  I should love everything Star Trek, but I do not.  I love some things more than others.  As a sci-fi fan, what I enjoy the most is a coherent story arc.  Star Trek, as a grand space opera, allows for that arc--but so often individual writers and stories interfere with that arc.  DS9 provides a very coherent arc that carries through much of the series, albeit with a fair amount of skipping forward, especially in the first couple of seasons.  TNG, like Voyager did have the Borg, but again, rewatching them there is a lot of skipping to get to the central arc. That brings us to the third season of Star Trek Enterprise....		The story of the Xindi threat to Earth, the Expanse, time traveling, interdimensional beings, along with the gathering of clues and information leading to a final resolution at the end of the season is the finest effort of Star Trek producers to make just about every episode have some element of the canon and arc.  Now, I cannot say everything was "edge of the seat", but the last 4 episodes of the season, and the satisfying resolution combined with another cliff hanger makes this season of Enterprise potentially my favorite of all the series.		I reserve the right to change this opinion since Amazon Prime is providing me the ability to sift through and rewatch DS9 (and truly there was a lot of satisfying canon within DS9)!		Update: 2-5-14  As I have sifted through the central story arc in the 7 seasons of DS9, and move towards the series finale in Season 7, I am thinking that I am about to change my mind.  The episodes dealing directly with the Prophets, along with those integrated with the Dominion War, present the best Star Trek ever.

0,My opinion of season 2 is pretty much the same as season 1 with the exception that the story lines seem to be improving, and by improving, I mean better variation.
0,I bought the DVD series because I always loved the show. It's a classic and how can you not love Anne Francis?!
0,Critically, as the film was innovative in its structure (avoiding most real Western  `action' until the end of the film), and avoided a number of stereotypes popularized by higher profile filmmakers like John Ford and Howard Hawks, and Western icon John Wayne, derided it as un-American, as well as worse things. That is has become so lauded, even as it was a low budget project, with almost no great nor spectacular battle scenes, is another reason so many of the classic Western film lovers have railed at it. Cinematographer Floyd Crosby does a good, if not spectacular, job. There is one infamous goof that he and film editors committed, and that is in a crane shot, late in the film, where the camera pulls back and up to reveal the town deserted and Kane alone. Unfortunately, in the upper left hand corner of the film, telephone poles and wires are clearly visible. Crosby's mot notable touch was in not fetishizing the Western tableaux, instead not filtering the light reflected from the surroundings, which led to a blanched, dessicated look to the black and white cinematography; along the lines of then contemporary documentary films.		  The DVD, put out by Lionsgate, comes with two disks. Disk one is in a 4:3 aspect ratio, and the transfer is spotless. The remastering of the film is superb. It scintillates with clarity. It also includes an audio commentary by the progeny of many of the people involved- the late actor, John Ritter, Carl Foreman's son, Jonathan, Fred Zinneman's son, Tim, and Gary Cooper's daughter, Maria Cooper-Janis. As in most commentaries featuring non-experts, this one quickly descends into meaningless banter and anecdotes, and many, `Gee, whiz, wasn't dad great' moments. The only comment of any worth comes when it's mentioned that, before he kills the first of the desperadoes, Kane calls out Miller's name, and shorts the man, therefore not plugging him in the back. The comment states this displays Kane's personal code of ethics, and while this is true, it is also one of the weaker moments in the film, because it goes against many of the other realistic moments (as does the plethora of 1950s-speak: Gollys and Gee whizzes abound)- a fact unmentioned in the commentary. But, good observations as this are rare on the track. Given the film's stature as a Western classic, one would have hoped for at least one expert commentary, by a noted historian of cinema. The second disk features a 50 minute making of film, Inside High Noon, and a shorter making of featurette. There is a featurette on singer Tex Ritter; a clip of Ritter singing the Oscar winning song Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darlin' on the Jimmy Dean tv show, a featurette called Behind High Noon, and a radio broadcast featuring Ritter. All of these features are useful, but none is really standout, nor top of the line, compared to the best DVD features. The real killer, as mentioned, is no expert commentary track.		  High Noon is certainly a classic, and with a few better decisions scriptwise and characterwise, and with a few better decisions technically, it would truly have been a great film. Greatness and classicality, however, are unrelated beasts. This film is classic melodrama stripped to its naked rot, and plays out almost like an episode of Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone. Its narrative bears down upon the viewer like the train that carries Frank Miller. It has moments of poignancy (see the looks between Kane and Helen), black humor (see when the hotel clerk asks Kane if he can find Helen's room when the marshal ascends the stairs), and mythos (scan the characters' names and personal traits for counterparts in assorted mythologies); as well as an ability to amplify these characteristics (note how every shot of the clocks, which visually builds tension, is accompanied by a slightly strumming sound). Technically, the film is top notch, but its fundamentals sag a bit. If only the bulk of films today could display such vices and virtues, what a wonderfully mortal art the masses could wallow in.
0,I am surprised that the distributor did not choose to include Season 3 into a collector set like they did with Season 1 and 2. For me I like either having an all-in-one collector set or buying individual titles so that my boxes are uniform. (Yes, my OCD kicks in like that)
0,Awesome!
0,Some of the best writing for a series, ever. The main thing, this series make you think and for many will create a need to search out the facts about government. It also gives us a great comedy of the idiocy of government.
0,I have already reviewed Amelie at Amazon's UK site, but that was after only one viewing (at the cinema), but I have now seen it a few more times after buying the (UK) DVD.	Needless to say, I still think this film is utterly brilliant. Having now seen Amelie 3 times I'm prepared to say it's definitely my favourite foreign language/subtitled film ever, surpassing previous favourites of mine like Life is beautiful & Cinema Paradiso. More importantly though, Amelie is fast becoming one of my all-time fave movies of ANY kind - regardless of the country of origin.	I won't bore you with the story, as you have in excess of 200 other reviews here you can get that from!, but just wanted to say a few points about the movie; Audrey Tautou is simply wonderful in the lead role, the film has a fantastic opening sequence with Amelie as a young girl, it is full of uplifting moments (like when the man finds his childhood treasure box in the phone booth), it is vibrant in colour and has a great visual style, and a superb soundtrack by Yann Tiersen which fits the film perfectly...Amelie is simply a wonderful film that deserves to be seen by as many people as possible, even those that don't normally watch subtitled movies.
0,Brought back great childhood memories. Really enjoyed watching this series 50 years later. I wonder if this is why I had a 26 year career in the US Navy,lol.  Thank you
0,Good
0,Got 2 copies not  so movie is great though.
0,I don't know why but I really enjoyed this movie so much so that I watched it twice. I give 5 stars only to movies that I want to watch over and over again.
0,Love this movie
0,thank you so much for this item! one of my all time favorite movies!
0,I first saw this movie as a young man, and I was amazed at the sheer number of first-rate acting talent it contained.  With stars like:  Peter Falk, David Niven, Peter Seller and Alec Guinness (to name a few) this movie should have been a more mainstream success, but sadly remains a cult-classic.  The main appeal of this film, comes in the form of it's spoofing of the Detective drama, and the methods of classic TV and Movie sleuths.  If you are fond of movies like "Scarey Movie," then you should enjoy this one.  The script and acting are top-notch, especially the characterization of Detective Wong, by Peter Sellers.  If you like Charlie Chan, Sam Spade, or the Thin Man movies, you will easily appreciate the humor and repect the writer give to the story.  It is especially funny, seeing these loner detectives trying to tell each other how to solve a case.  Even if you don't favor the realm of crime drama, there is more than enough goofy sight gags and slapstick comedy to appeal to most anyone.  I hope you enjoy!
0,This movie is so nice in the fact that they didn't add swear words, violence, or anything scary.  It is perfect for little girls.  It teaches about friendship and family.  So nice to see.  I wish there were more movies like these Holly Hobbie movies.
0,Brings back memories of the old days with the goodies always winning. Good 50's tv I like it, brings back memories of good tv was my favourite show as kid
0,it was good
0,A fun walk down memory lane with all the great games. It made for a great family movie night with preteens.
0,I bought this DVD for my son.  He is 3.  So far he is not into it.  I do the video to set a good example.  The workout makes me feel better and I break a sweat.  I hope as he gets older he will show more interest.  So far he prefers yoga, especially the DVDs that include animals or letters.
0,great
0,Having just watched the previous DVD version, I wasn't sure that the Blue Ray would make a big difference. But it does. Sight and sound is as good as it gets.
0,Great series.  Love watching it again.  Lt Columbo is hilarious!
0,"Basic had more twist then a twizler!" Basic was a fresh Military/Thriller for me, that entertained me till the end! I did not see this movie in theaters, but I did rent it. The movie had a much deeper story then the trailer let on. John Travolta and Sam Jackson light up the screen once again! A must rent DVD!
0,My girls absolutely loved this, I enjoyed it as well, although not as much as them, they were ready to rewatch this over and over again. Needless to say they are excited for the next Monster High movie.
0,This is a great starter for someone who is a beginner and has a lot of weight on thier bodies. It lets you pace yourself and still gets you moving to lose the pounds.
0,Had a hard time finding this movie very glad I did I really like watching it.
0,My children just love this movie.
0,I enjoy it very much. It is different from the usual  shows.
0,I like those movies that test the moral character of the leader...
0,Well, there's already several long and detailed reviews about this film, so I'll just keep mine sort and to the point.		Obviously this movie tells the tale of the Civil War in Sierra Leone over "conflict diamonds" in the late '90s...specifically 1999.  Conflict diamonds are basically those that are mined in Sierra Leone, but then smuggled into neighboring countries like Liberia (which was lead at the time by Charles Taylor) and then sold on the black market for much more than what the government Sierra Leone would be willing to pay and then sell them for.		This lead to a group of rebels (the RUF - Revolutionary United Front) to spring up to oppose the government.  However these rebels were brutal in their diamond mining process.  They'd shoot anybody that didn't provide their share of slave work to mine the diamonds, basically.  This got to the point of slaughtering entire villages and then even the capital city, Freetown.  It wasn't until 2003 when a Treaty was signed by all diamond-producing African countries to keep "conflict diamonds" out of Western retailers.  However, this treaty isn't perfect and even to this day, many diamonds make it through this somewhat loose treaty and make it to stores near you.		I may sound like a bleeding heart liberal on this issue, but this is pretty much the only issue I feel this way about.  I'm pretty much a hard conservative when it comes to everything else, but mining diamonds is pretty much legalized slavery and people die for the slighest infringement on their so-called duties.  Women really need to think twice before they request a huge rock from their fiances.  How many people have to die for you to wear a piece of ice?
0,Not bad independent flim give it a watch, the main actor is kinda annoying but all in all not a flim
0,I was quite happy to finally be able to get an uncut version compatible with US dvd players, so I ordered the cardboard bloody jewel case version of this film, its listed as English dub but its spoken in Serbian with english subtitles with no way to change it, Thought I would do a review because I did not read anyone else mentioning that in their review, when you click on audio during the movie its even listed as English but is indeed not. As far as the movie I see a lot of hatred for this film calling it garbage and so forth, that is not the case at all and I believe people are so taken back by the visual occurrences that I think they miss the political aspect of the film and don't quite understand the possibility of these very things being very common in third world countries...this film is shot very nicely and does not come across as low budget, the plot is insanity and the way its presented is crazy to, its definitely a work of art that I believe is very misunderstood solely based on shock value. I would give this movie 5 stars if it was actually dubbed in English like it stated and for that fact alone I have taken away a star just for this particular product.
0,I am pleased with my product
0,Typical Dukes!
0,You can never go wrong with Larry David's genius humor!  Love every season of "Curb!"
0,This was pretty good book too.
0,This is much more than a prison riot film. In fact, the entire first two hours are spent exploring the lives and back stories of a select group of prisoners. Using a technique that will be familiar to viewers of the HBO series "Oz", we follow each of the prisoners in flashback through the series of events that led to their imprisonment.  We also come to know what level of status (or lack of it) they each hold within the prison pecking order.		The result is for the most part a detailed portrait of daily life at Carandiru -- rivalries, loyalties, fights, love affairs, drug abuse, and murder -- along with a portrayal of the warden and his staff that is unexpectedly sympathetic.		It is worth noting that, while the conditions inside are certainly filthy and deplorable, the prisoners enjoy a surprising amount of freedom compared to similar facilities in the States. What surprised me most is a "family day" that is held each year where parents, wives, girlfriends, and children come to mingle throughout the facility with their jailed loved ones. Families picnic together and couples enjoy conjugal visits.		When the riot eventually does break out, it is not simply because the prisoners are rebelling against the poor conditions .. it is also because of one or more events that take place. (Nobody is quite capable of saying exactly which event or combination of them.) What is far more clear is the brutality shown by the police riot squad as it takes control of the facility once the prisoners have surrendered their weapons. Blood literally runs through the hallways and down the stairwells. Having come to know many of the prisoners as people makes these scenes very difficult to watch.		Overall this is an excellent movie, although anyone expecting 2-1/2 hours of hostage-taking and violence will be disappointed by its insistence on first taking the measure of the prisoners' humanity.
0,Make no mistake blood, and guts, with plenty of action and some G-shots, but this is not your'e typical t&A movie booooring ! Don't get me wrong love the ladies, this is a very well made movie you feel the action and sense of being involved highly recommended !!
0,Excellent movie!!
0,When you consider the impact of the Addams Family TV show it's really hard to wrap your mind around the fact that it was only on the air for 2 years.		But decades latter we have a broadway musical and two fairly recent movies to prove that it is still relevant and unique. This is truly a American classic! Nearly anyone over the age of 50 will recogize the finger snapping music and know at least somethine about Thing, Lurch, Cousin  IT, Uncle Fester, etc.		And, of course, we also have the orginial comics from an earlier time!		The pictue was, if anything, better than originally shown - it's hard to tell because of the differences in technology, etc. Sound was as good as it's going to be. Acting is 'hammy' just as I remembered. John Astin is superb as Gomez and  Carolyn Jones is wonderful as Morticia.		Ted Cassidy is great as Lurch - Jackie Coogan as Uncle Fester is very memorable as well. The phase, 'you rang' has entered the publics consciousness - in fact I still hear it from time to time today almost 50 years after it was 1st used on the TV show.		This a great show at a very good price - nearly everyone should buy or get this at their local library!		I would rate this a very high 9.0 to 9.5 out of 10 - HIGHLY RECOMENDED!
0,Perhaps the perfect popcorn movie.
0,Nice 'romance novel' adaptation. Mild suspense, not too violent, the usual suspects and like most romance novels, improbable solves and wins among the wealthy.
0,As others can scare small kids -not pet dino's
0,Craig is no Bond is this Brit Drug crime drama.  Solid cast of usual suspects.  Bloody at time and a shocker ending.	Recommended.
0,Bert I. Gordon's Earth Vs. The Spider (1958 - 73m) is a thoroughly enjoyable trip back into 50's era movie monsterdom. If you are a fan of these "there goes the neighborhood" films of its day, you must add this one to your early sci fi collection. A successful attempt at deciding not to use stop action animation, Gordon's idea of suspense and small town panic work well as a pretty great looking over sized furry eight legged demon terrorizes small town USA. Be prepared for a few laughs too but this one should not be seen without an industrial sized can of DECON. Have fun with this one!
0,Here's a great sports tale, based on a true story, that has all the components - lost opportunities, regret, a broken family, cute kids, a mini-movie about a Bad News Bears-like team, and a dream come true for an unlikely hero! Yay!!		Dennis Quaid is great as Jimmy Morris, who became the oldest rookie major league baseball player at age 35 when he played for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. The film covers Jimmy's childhood, his dreams of playing baseball, the constant family moves as his father shifted from job to job within the US military, and then his adulthood - first, as a high school baseball coach, then as a man on a mission to succeed. Each part of the film is sweet and well-made. Quaid plays the part very well, and we see a lot of agony on his twisted face... and occasionally some glee. His wife, who's hardly in the film for the first half, is given some crucial scenes in the second half, and this part sometimes feels a bit forced; but that's more than balanced by a great performance from cute child actor Angus T Jones, playing Morris' son Hunter (Morris' two daughters hardly appear in the film) who just wants to see his dad play in the big game and accidentally says wise things.		The disc comes with some pretty good extras, such as a cool 35-minute documentary on the real Jimmy Morris (and it is here that we realise that Dennis Quaid looks nothing like him), where he discloses his feelings from those years. We also get to meet one of the kids that Morris had coached to championship earlier on, and a 18-minute reel of deleted scenes and director's commentary on why these completed scenes were omitted (even though one of them was the director of photography's career-favorite, and another scene was a favorite of the screenwriter); none of them are spectacular, and some of them are hokey (the inspirational speech in the bus about chopping wood, for example). Most scenes were considered superfluous, and one scene where Jimmy hints as why he thinks he got his full pitching speed back was considered unnecessary as it interfered with peoples' natural tendency to come up with their own explanations for it (which is more fun). The last extra feature is a hokey "Spring training" video where the baseball coach from the set puts together a reel of tips for baseball players.
0,I watched DBZ as a youngster, now I watch it with my son. We love them.
0,HALLOWEEN 3: THE SEASON OF THE WITCH is the only sequel that doesn't revolve around Michael Myers since HALLOWEEN III focuses on an investigation by an alcoholic down-on-his-luck surgeon Dr. Challis(Tom Atkins)into the activities of a wicked warlock Conal Cochran(Daniel O'Herlihy)whom is the mysterious owner of a Silver Shamrock Novelties company in a fictional small remote town in Northern California called Santa Mira which was mostly filmed in the small coastal town of Loleta, CA.		Since writers John Carpenter & Debra Hill were reluctant about making a 3rd installment of the HALLOWEEN saga; Carpenter & Hill only agreed to participate if HALLOWEEN 3 wasn't a direct sequel to HALLOWEEN 2, which meant no Michael Myers, no obsessed Dr. Loomis(Donald Pleasance), no hapless victim Laurie Strode(Jamie Lee Curtis), no Sheriff Brackett(Charles Cyphers), and no Haddonfield, Illinois.		Therefore HALLOWEEN 3 departs from the slasher film genre which was spawned by the original HALLOWEEN in 1978 since HALLOWEEN 3 features a "mad scientist" theme for the villian instead of Michael Myers being the villian since the producers apparently felt that the Michael Myers character was getting tired and needed a rest and felt it was time for a change by having this HALLOWEEN sequel take place on the West Coast instead of the Midwest, especially since Michael Myers presumably died off along with Dr. Loomis in HALLOWEEN 2 which by the way was released in the Fall of 1981.		Therefore, the producers had also changed the slogan for HALLOWEEN III to "The Night Nobody Comes Home" which was the opposite to the slogan used in the original HALLOWEEN which was "The Night He Came Home".		Unfortunately, HALLOWEEN 3 had bombed at the box office since this thriller was produced on a budget of $2.5 million dollars, but only grossed $14.4 million at the box office during its release in the Fall of 1982 being rated the poorest performing HALLOWEEN sequel & was given very negative reviews by critics, unlike the original HALLOWEEN which had broken new ground in the Fall of 1978 and was imitated by many genre films following its wake.		Therefore, Six years later after HALLOWEEN 3's release, the producers had decided to bring Michael Myers and Dr. Loomis back when they finally released HALLOWEEN 4: THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS in the Fall of 1988 by revising the story around a little bit by having Michael Myers go back to Haddonfield on Halloween night of 1988 after being in a coma for 10 years and that Michael Myers & Dr. Loomis had nearly burned to death in the hospital fire on Halloween night of 1978 instead of actually dying off.		Something else I noticed was Nancy Loomis who played Dr. Challis's ex-wife(Linda Challis)in HALLOWEEN 3: THE SEASON OF THE WITCH was also the same gal who played Laurie's smart-aleck friend(Annie Brackett)in HALLOWEEN I and Dick Warlock which played one of Cochran's androids in HALLOWEEN III had played Michael Myers in HALLOWEEN II.
0,This movie has an alien invasion plot not unlike 1950's American science fiction. However there are peculiar Japanese elements, especially the debate about using what would now be called a weapon of mass destruction one time only, to save the earth. The special effects are surprisingly good.
0,Excellent documentary!
0,I like this series. They don't mess around. Action then it's over.
0,i bought this for my mom she love this Christmas movie she already watch it and she want to watch it again she is thinking about when she want to watch it
0,We enjoy all Critters movies.
0,People are such fools!!  They want to be ENTERTAINED, then they bitch that the movie isn't close to the truth!  The world doesn't know s*** about HISTORY or the TRUTH and this is as close to the truth as it gets!!  There is a HISTORICAL character Ambrosius Aurelianus; that was both ROMAN & BRITIAN, who led the Britians against the Anglo-Saxons.  Many Historians Agree that this is the "Mythical" Arthur.
0,We love these shows, very funny, cute, good one. We will looking for more products from you in future. Thank you guys and have a good day!!
0,For Laurel & Hardy fans this is a dream set. While the films vary widely as to how the prints survive this is a beautifully put together record of the best looking prints that there are. In the early days of sound there were version made in Spanish and other languages with L&H phonetically speaking their parts in versions that are sometimes much longer than the U.S. releases. This ten disc set allows true L&H fans to have access to the majority of the Hal Roach work. Some of the prints have comment tracks that give some interesting insights to where and how these classic were done. Only wish that their silent films were included.
0,I always wondered what would happen if you place a giant monster in the streets of NYC - other than complete and utter chaos. This movie is very clever. It's godzilla meets blair witch.		The intro is kind of boring because the movie takes too long introducing the characters. Once you get past that, it's a rollercoaster ride (with motion sickness).
0,Freddie Highmore is a charming young actor whose acting I enjoy and I've always loved children's fantasy stories.  It's good for adults to be in  touch their inner child.  This one was interesting in the fact that it was a little different from most.
0,This film is lighthearted, entertaining, and I love that the characters are based on real people.  I will be looking up the women portrayed in this film and the works they have accomplished for their people and sending money to their cause.  I am an aboriginal from Canada and I like escaping the horrors of history and enjoying the bright side of things, even if they are few are far between.  To my aboriginal sisters in Australia...Peace

0,The steel book is very nice and worth the pick up to a great film. No inside artwork, but it's no real big deal to a fantastic packaging.
0,First 5 minutes: Kira and Odo Eskimo kiss *gags*	  Jake is already complaining about everything...god this isn't looking to be a good episode		But don't worry it gets real interesting after that. An ancient artifact is discovered and Sisko; the Emissary, begins another mission to unravel a mystery concerning the prohets and their predictions recorded centuries ago. An epic battle ensues on the ethereal plain and the Spirits choose interesting hosts. However their struggle for good and evil is not contained to their reality but spills over into DS9 and could possibly destroy it. All in all a very intriguing episode, recommended.
0,I am a prime member and have watched the series from start to seventh season.  Why am I being charged as a prime member, when just last week it was free?  Not fair
0,Madea is in "rare form" in this play. She has new talent and delivers her Christmas spirit of great tidings of comfort and joy as only she can. There is a lesson to be learned and Madea is the teacher! Another movie to add to your collection. I enjoyed it!!!
0,My daughter loves this series.  I would say it's for teens.  While it says "complete series" -- look at the boxes' small print carefully, because there are a lot of seasons of this and as far as I know, they whole series isn't in any one boxed set.  Anyway, this is a very tongue-in-cheek view of WWII, for entertainment purposes only (though at least she now knows who was involved and where the alliances were--) and I would say that you may want to see if you can experience Hetalia elsewhere (you tube?) first before shelling out the money for this-- I think some people would find it offensive, but they do tease all nationalities equally and for anyone that has a good sense of humor and isn't too sensitive, they would probably find it it entertaining (Each country is personified in a hyper-stereotypical way into one character-- For example, America is a burger eater... slightly lazy.  Italy says "make pasta, not war!", etc.)
0,I absolutely love this movie.
0,Are You Being Served(AYBS)which ran from 1972 to 1985,certainly has to go down as one of the BBC's biggest television sitcom triumphs ever. This rather ordinary setting in an old style English department store was populated with some of the most eccentric but lovable characters you would ever find on TV anywhere.	Mrs Slocombe(Mollie Sugden)whose hairstyle/colour changed as often as the weather. Her catch phrases were,among others,"weak as water",when referring to the men. When she wanted to emphasize a statement she would say"...and I am unanimous in that...".	Miss. Brahms(Wendy Richards)was Mrs. Slocombe's assistant in the womens wear department,whose cockney accent and less than stellar mind,would sometimes rate an admonishment from Mrs. Slocombe in the form of"That will all,Miss Brahms".	Mr. Peacock(Frank Thornton)whose pompous attitude and sarcasm/stares as the stores floorwalker were something else to behold. He was always berating the maintenance staff for being on the floor during open hours.	Mr. Grainger(Arthur Brough)was the oldest and most crotchety man on the floor and senior salesman in the mens wear department. He seem to be doing a constant reprising of Winston Churchill. If trouble arose for him it was always"...a glass of water for Mr Grainger".	Mr. Humphries(John Inman)was the effeminate/mama's boy who never left home. He was second behind Mr. Grainger. When Capt. Peacock would glance his way with"Are you free,Mr. Humphries",an inevitably alone Mr. Humphries would respond"Yes,I am free" and do his famous quick walk over to the Captain.	Mr. Lucas(Trevor Bannister) was the young assistant to Mr Humphries,and he always had a comeback,especially towards Mrs. Slocombe.	Mr. Rumbold(Nicholas Smith)was the Mickey Mouse eared boss of all(next of course behind the young Mr Grace,the owner).He would steal others suggestions for his own and was sometimes hard to get a point through to;in other words,pretty thick.	This cornucopia of characters,along with so many other memorable ones,with all their foibles and quirks were quite lovable and one could easily empathize with them as they all had their feet firmly based in reality;the cornerstone of good comedy.	Technically speaking the shows(all 69 eps on 14 discs,two in one slip case)have been transferred wonderfully. The only glitch in the set that I found was on the ep "Pop Star".During the beginning music it suddenly stalls(stuck on one note)for two or three seconds then continues. The film itself is still moving so it is either a glitch from the original film master or something from the transfer. Along with the 69 eps are the original pilot. Also are some wonderful extras on the two end discs. They contain featurettes on three of its main stars,the best of AYBS,a AYBS special starring Inman playing Mr Humphries and his mother and ep#1 from Grace and Favour,the sequel series to AYBS.Along with many of the earlier eps comes some trivia about each and each ep features a lead in from a closing and opening elevator door,with the title of the ep being spoken. There is a lexicon of sorts included for those who don't quite get all of the English phraseology.	All in all a highly recommended box set of one of the funniest BBC shows ever to air. Some of the funniest double entendre's,farce and even slapstick will have you laughing out loud as you watch them. Highly Recommended.	FYI- Out of most of the main cast only Frank Thornton(Mr Peacock) and Nicholas Smith(Mr. Rumbold) are still with us as of this writing.
0,Wow! This video shows everything, and I mean EVERYTHING! The guys aren't just offering glimpses either... these are full-on extended scenes of the hottest young studs doing things to themselves that I would never expect to see outside a XXX movie. Very, very hot.
0,A really good movie.  Really  enjoyable.  A good movie for the kids.
0,Liked it!
0,A very touching story of loyalty, love and compassion. Well presented how a couple in a "none traditional" love can overcome obstacles, trials and distrust as one entity and come out stronger. If you have a heart and love love stories no matter who is involved check this movie/story out!!
0,Good Movie and Original Perspective From  Christ Life Up To 12 years Old. As You Know It's Speculative As Not Much Is Actually Written But Has A Few Interesting Thoughts... Bill Mahon Photo
0,What a wonderful set. Throughout the years I purchased and re-purchased these films. Now, for the very first time, all of these films are beautifully remastered. The  Wolf Man and Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein are the same as the Universal 100th Anniversary edition - the highest quality version of these films ever released. But now, add to it Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man, House of Frankenstein and House of Dracula, plus Werewolf of London and She-Wolf of London - all remastered.		I recently purchased a Blu-Ray version of Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man from France. Comparing the French Blu-Ray release to this one this release is top notch. The French release had white dots throughout the frames in the beginning and even a splice in the titles. This release is sharp and clear - free of artifacts and changes in lighting.		The worst of this collection - although still fantastic video - is Werewolf of London. Throughout the soundtrack are lots of audio pops, but still, the quality of this print compared to others is high quality.		She-Wolf of London (with June Lockhart of Lassie and Lost in Space) is another masterful release in the best quality possible. Sharp and clean, it's a great addition to the collection, although don't expect the same wolfy face you've come to expect in the other werewolf movies.		This is the ultimate Wolf Man collection. If you have this in DVD, I highly recommend upgrading to this Blu-Ray edition. You will be thrilled with the quality. Even though there aren't any extras on the Son/Ghost or the triple movie disc except for unmastered theatrical trailers, the value of such high-quality films outweighs the lack of extras.		If you're a fan of these classic film, this is a must-buy collection!
0,It's the new year, 2016. Along with 75% of the rest of the population, I resolve to get into better shape than I am currently in. I bought this workout video because I was looking for something that I could do that would change throughout the month so that I wouldn't get tired of the same old workouts. I was pleasantly surprised that the workouts are broken up into weekly routines. I like that the actual contestants from the show are the people doing the exercises on the tape, it makes me feel like a normal person when doing the workouts with them. I have done half of the workouts on the DVD and I have really enjoyed them. They are simple but effective routines that anyone new to working out can do easily. I personally am morbidly obese and I have been able to keep up with the routines with not trouble. I also likethat they have at least one person in the group doing the modified workout so that I know what to do when I get to a part that I can't do. Overall, this is a great DVD.
0,This was well cast. I rented this on the strength of Firth and Kidman without even knowing what it was about. They have both have a history of solid performances and continue that trend in this movie.		The story of a emotionally tortured POW is also solid. It's true, moving, gritty, and like life, is not particularly pretty.		So, why does feel like it fell short of the mark? I am just guessing here, but I think that perhaps the visuals and auditory support (sound, scenery) did not do a good job of supporting the acting and writing. Those were fine. It just didn't have the emotional impact that it could have. Good story. Not a great movie.
0,Really lovely transfer! The best the film has ever looked. Horror Hotel the shorter print is a rough old print as a special feature but then it's the same film as City of The Dead except that it's 2 or 3 mins shorter.
0,This is one of our most favorite movies! A great love story! I only wish they had actually filmed in Sitka.

0,This '60's series was a real good WW2 show. The weekly battles against "The Desert Fox" troops was entertaining to say the least. A good purchase for anyone who is into the history of WW2.
0,Good movie
0,Cute cute movie!  Left off right after the first one, and the first one was good too!
0,This film is a treasure. Based on the Charles Dickens novel, John Mills stars as Pip, a young man who leaves the world of apprenticing a blacksmith to becoming a young gentleman of society. Mills is excellent, as is the whole cast, which also includes Alec Guinness and Valerie Hobson (and Jean Simmons as the love of Pip's childhood).		Director David Lean, before he started doing epic dramas such as The Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia and others, was a master at small personal dramas early in his career (In Which We Serve, Brief Encounter, Oliver Twist). The black and white photography is used splendidly here, with sets that often reflect so much bleakness that black and white is perfect for them. There is so much atmosphere in every detail in every shot.		And it is all captured with incredible picture quality crispness on Blu-ray. The film hasn't been remastered but it is still an exceptional Blu disc to own. The audio is 2.0 mono and there are no extras, but I HIGHLY recommend buying this title. (As this is a classic British movie, it is unlikely that it will get an American release, so you should jump on it while it is available from places like Amazon UK. Luckily, this import can be played on all North American Blu-ray players.)
0,Well the only bad part about this, is yes it is blue ray, but the extras aren't there or suck. So enjoy the picture quality of this incredible movie, period.
0,nice movie
0,If you are a X-files fan, you must own the entire collection.	Amazing features and video quality. The 8th season has the best soundtrack and story about Mulder abduction and Scully pregnancy.
0,This is almost meditative.  Love it!
0,I enjoyed this film.	Jeremy Renner is a good action star.	Just much action as the other Bourne films.	I would recommend this.
0,What a romp!  Loved it!
0,Loved the story line and of course Maggie Smith.
0,There is no one else who could be as much of a filmmaking genius as producer Peter Jackson! The Prawns look so seem less within our real world, and the characters are all memorable. So much weight and emotion is into our main protagonist, that you want to see him succeed at what he does here. This was a sci fi movie which has never been seen before, and is completely original! A new timeless classic!
0,enjoyable movie

0,My husband loved reminiscing about the Dracula movies he saw when he was a child.
0,great
0,Great performances by Cate Blanchett and Tommy Lee Jones. Excellent movie. Better than most westerns.
0,I have enjoyed viewing this series again.  I had never watched the pilot, and I enjoyed it very much.  I do like the new captain better than the one in the pilot.  Excellent entertainment.
0,Rizzoli and Isles addicts.  Great to have on DVD to watch over and over again, and never get tired.
0,This was fun to watch, although Burt Reynolds doesn't get much action, like in later years. Darrin McGavin really has his hands full in these series!
0,very different angle for Holocaust detainees.  True love for a child.
0,love survivor
0,I love this show.
0,It's not too often that you get a fine mix of stoner comedy, and good horror/suspense rolled up together into the same movie. And to have them mix as well as the ingredients to a fried peanut butter, jelly and fluff sandwich with bananas. Mmmmmm, thats something worthy of note. Just make sure that the knife you use to make that sandwich with isn't covered in your parents blood.		Idle Hands is a gory thriller, about a demonic hand, that attaches itself to various hosts, and at some point figures out how to run amok by itself. I didn't think too much of this movie going in, but by the end I really enjoyed it. I remember this getting slammed with bad critical reviews back when it came out. Easy to see why. Really, the only ones who can appreciate this are stoned teenagers... or the few who can accept what a stoned teen movie should be all about. Things that will make a stoner movie stand out... Like a hot topless chick in KISS makeup, Mr. Magoo cartoons, and the pet cat getting chucked out a window windmill style by its tail. Add 'em up. Then factor in Jessica Alba, who I've gone all these years considering to be a little bit over rated by teen jock types. She is truly amazing in this film. I'd say her best role ever. She doesn't get topless like the KISS chick, but bedazzles the eyes throughout just the same... especially in that Halloween costume!		Some geniune fright filled scenes here, surely this movie holds up in the teen scream category (much better for instance then any of those "Scream" movies... ) as well as good stoner camp material, and a bunch of amusing action too. I recommend this one, I really liked it!
0,Based on the Cormac McCarthy novel, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MAN is quite simply a joy to watch, as it continually frustrates our expectations of what kind of movie it is expected to be.  Set in Texas, New Mexico and Mexico itself, it is a western that isn't a western; a chase film in which bad guy Anton Chigurh (Javier Badem) pursues Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), while being himself pursued by Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones).  One of those chases is resolved; the other is left hanging in the air.  The film builds up a fair amount of suspense, as we wonder whether Chigurh and Bell are going to get their men, yet the Coen Brothers continually combine that suspense with an eye for telling detail, or the inclusion of quirky sequences designed to show the futility of the entire quest theme.  One of my favorite quirky sequences takes place in a dirty roadside motel, where the camera cuts to a sign outside saying ("HBO Available").  The whole notion of cable television in this kind of motel seems particularly incongruous.  The performances are simply brilliant: Bardem doesn't have a lot to say, but communicates everything through telling glances.  By contrast Brolin seems more laid back, despite the fact that he is being continually pursued.  Jones goes through the motions of ensuring that justice should be done, but seems to be looking for a quiet life all the time.  It is significant that the dramatic tension slackens somewhat during his sequences.  NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is the kind of movie that befits repeated viewings in order to uncover its subtleties.  A true modern classic.
0,Coming from the 60s this was a blast to the past.
0,The movie was well done. I read all three books and can higly recommend them all.	The only suggestion I might have would be to perhaps recommend a dialog or narration as part of the film as this could clue individuals a little better as to what is going on. It is sometimes a little confusing to follow (in the film) unless you have read the books.	Still, I highly enjoyed the movie.
0,Chris Pratt: Dinosaur Whisperer		Before I get into my thoughts on Jurassic World, I think it's relevant to know about my relationship with it's great-grandfather, Jurassic Park.		In 1993, as a 12 year old, I was not able to go to see Jurassic Park in theaters because some kid down the block went and had to be taken out of the theater because he was 'too scared'. Thanks, kid - this was a real bummer to a person who loved dinosaurs as a boy. We got it on VHS about a year later and I was mesmerized. Spielberg had created a masterpiece. I've seen it at least 20 times by now (the last being when they re-released it in theaters in 3D a few years ago) and it still holds up today. The dinosaurs had to be amazing to sell that movie, and they were. I LOVE Jurassic Park.		Now surprisingly, I have never seen the two sequels. I remember seeing the trailer for The Lost World, seeing dinosaurs out in New York City or something and thinking, "Nope, I'm good." The third went back to the well, but I was already out by then. I didn't feel I needed to get back to that world, I mean...Jurassic Park was just so perfect.		22 years later, Jurassic World was here, and I decided it was time to get back to that world. I was excited for two reasons: Colin Trevorrow and Chris Pratt.		Everyone knows who Chris Pratt is by now - he was in two of the best and most popular movies last year in The Lego Movie and Guardians of the Galaxy - but I've been following him since 2009 as the lovable loser Andy Dwyer from Parks & Recreation. He's charismatic and hilarious, and I can't help but root for him. Trevorrow is a bit more under the radar. I became a Trevorrow fan after seeing his first (and only) feature, Safety Not Guaranteed. It's a fantastic little film about time travel that deserves to be seen. He has talent.		Anyway, on to the movie. The setup is that Jurassic World is an evolved version of the original - more attractions, more dinosaurs, and more money. In an allegory to the series, the people who run the park know that they need bigger, scarier, cooler dinosaurs to keep audiences coming back, so scientists on the island create a hybrid dinosaur. Predictably, things go wrong. It's up to a park manager and a dino-trainer to help save the day.		We follow a child through a crowded monorail as it approaches the park, introducing us to Jurassic World. He nears the window to see the monolith and the classic Jurassic Park theme song swells...it was amazing.  I felt like that kid, coming back to the park. The following 90 minutes were really great. The dinosaur effects were brilliant - particularly the I-Rex - and blended in with the scenery. There weren't any eye-rolling CGI moments like in San Andreas. The actors did a fine job with what they had to work with. The climax is thrilling.		The movie isn't perfect. The 'military' aspect of the movie is uninteresting. The writing is awful and some of the setup is just plain weird (you're telling me that a giant sea dwelling dinosaur can jump stories into the air to snatch a shark off of a string, but it can't turn a bit to the right to eat all of the people watching it?). The characters are very one dimensional, have weak dialogue, and are almost weak carbon copies of people in the first Jurassic Park (person who doesn't like kids but realizes how cool they are by being surrounded and responsible for two of them...Claire from Jurassic World or Dr. Grant from Jurassic Park?). I thought that a raptor was the most well written character - YOU'RE MY BOY, BLUE! My wife said the most unrealistic part of the movie was not that dinosaurs could be cloned...but that Claire could run around the entire movie in high heels. Yes, this woman ran through jungles from DINOSAURS and kept her heels on the entire time.		Story stupidity aside, it's a really fun movie and I'm glad that I saw it. Pratt is charming, the effects are fantastic, and there are plenty of put you on the edge of your seat moments. If you love Jurassic Park like I do, you'll really like Jurassic World.		Final Score: B+
0,I enjoyed this film a lot!  I was surprised at the problems Walt had getting his business off the ground.  His persistence in the face of so many obstacles was impressive!  I was also surprised that all my fave cartoonists worked together from the beginning of their careers, and a little sad that the Loony Toons guys left Disney the way that they did.
0,Very good. Angelique Boyer is a wonderful actress.
0,A good flick.  Didn't love it; didn't hate it.  Maybe I'm too old for the story.  Perceptions change as the decades roll by.
0,My kids love these!!!	Great Price!!	Fast Shipping!!! PERFECT CONDITION!!!	Made Christmas Shopping STRESS FREE!!!	Thank you!!! I will shop again!!!
0,Another classic... I got this one for my grandkids but more for my husband. This was one of his favorites as a child... this and " Fiddler on the Roof" which I bought for his birthday a few years ago. We've watched it numerous times and love it!
0,M. Night Shyamalan's THE SIXTH SENSE has ranked high on my list of favorite films ever since its 1999 theatrical release.	First of all, it hits close to home.  Why?  First off, Shyamalan graduated from Waldron Mercy Academy, my private Catholic school, back when it was Waldron Academy and all-boys.  Today, the nationally renowned school is coed.  Second, THE SIXTH SENSE is filmed in the bustling city of Philadelphia, PA, very close to where I lived.  I recognized most, if not all of the places shown in Shyamalan's thriller.	That said, it didn't necessarily mean I was going to automatically enjoy the film.  At the age of 11, I was hasty to see it.  But my Daddy, as usual, bribed me into it, assuring me I wouldn't regret seeing the movie.	"Whatever," I muttered as he dragged me to the neighborhood cinema.	I had set my standards low.  I arrived in the theatre, expecting a Pepsi, a Hershey bar, and a nap.	I was pleasantly surprised.  In fact, I was elated!	The talented Bruce Willis takes on the role of psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe, very distinguished in his profession.  Haley Joel Osment, newcomer to the big screen, plays Cole Sear, a disturbed 8 year-old.  His mother, up in arms about what to do with her withdrawn and unhappy son, calls Dr. Crowe to help sort out the situation.  Mrs. Sear, a single parent, is wonderfully played by Toni Colette, who brings life and significance to her character, giving off a near immaculate 3-dimensional performance.	Cole is blessed.  Or is he cursed?  You decide.  He has been bestowed/cursed with the power of the sixth sense, a skill both ugly and horrible, in a sense.  Cole, with this magical skill, can help others.  Yet at the same time, his sixth sense haunts him to the point of insanity.  "I see dead people," he eventually explains to Dr. Crowe.  Indeed, young Cole speaks the harrowing truth.  He sees ghostly apparations that haunt him by night and show themselves by day, terrifying and confusing him to no end.  Alas, Dr. Crowe is unprepared when Cole enlightens him with this information.	Yet this new knowledge is a beginning for various journeys.  Together, the doctor and his young patient travel to places previously unbeknownst to them.  Their adventures lead them to both saddening truths and irrevocable consequences.	THE SIXH SENSE proves to a fickle audience, namely America, that special effects aren't required to make a superb and memorable horror film.  M. Night Shyamalan's unforgettable effort (not his first, FYI) is bone chilling, dazzling, and beautiful, with performances that either launched careers or furthered them.  This film is a masterpiece, no matter how you try to look at it, and it deserved all 6 of its Oscar nods.  Yes, it broke my heart when it didn't win any...	Enjoy this thrilling treat, if you haven't already.
0,A live-action Terry Pratchett movie is either doomed to fail in every way, or succeed in practically everything.		And "The Colour of Magic," adapted from the first two novels in Pratchett's brilliant Discworld series, is more the former than the latter. This one is no "Hogather" -- it has rather slack direction at times -- but it preserves Pratchett's wry satirical sense of humour. And of course, it's all about a mercenary, cowardly failed wizard.		Rincewind (David Jason) is ejected from the Unseen University, on the very day that Twoflower (Sean Astin) arrives with his many-legged Luggage. He's come to the Disc... to "look at it." But after Rincewind tries to con Twoflower, the Patrician (Jeremy Irons) orders Rincewind to be the guide/bodyguard of the Disc's first ever tourist.		After a massive fire sweeps through the city, the two end up fleeing Ankh-Morpork and running into all sorts of weird things -- a very assertive magic sword, a floating island full of see-through dragons, a dramatic dragonlady in a leather bikini, astrozoologists trying to determine Great A'Tuin's gender, the aged Cohen the (retired) Barbarian, druids, and even getting thrown clear off the Disc in a strange spacecraft. And you thought YOU had problems.		Unfortunately the Unseen University is having troubles of its own -- the magical book Octavo is acting weird, and power-hungry Trymon (Tim Curry) is scheming against the Archchancellor. Even worse, a strange red star has appeared in the sky, and the world is facing destruction. The only thing that can save it is the spell in Rincewind's head.		Perhaps it's because it's based on the first, roughest Discworld books, but "Colour of Magic" is not quite as funny or tightly-written as its predecessor, "Hogather." The writing is not quite as complex or as witty, and the direction sometimes feels a bit slack (such as the bar fight scene, or Trymon skulking and schemind around the University).		But despite these drawbacks, "Colour of Magic" is still a vastly entertaining story -- it has a solid plotline and it chugs away nicely after a somewhat sluggish beginning, and blossoms into full-out complexity about halfway through.  Once it gets underway it starts to resemble a road-trip through fantasy-land, with our quirky tourist and wizard bungling their way across the Disc.		Along the way there's some fun action (an upside-down duel), humorous dialogue ("You weren't born with a mysterious birthmark in the shape of a crown, were you?"), and a general air of tongue-in-cheekness.  Best of all, it's a fantasy spoof -- Vadim Jean preserves Pratchett's clever satire aimed at the staples of your average fantasy: fantasy babes, prophecies, magic swords, retired barbarians, powerful artifacts, and even the idea of reality warping itself to save the "hero."		Jason is wonderfully snivelly and sour as Rincewind, a failed wizard who basically finds himself repeatedly swept up into bizarre, deadly circumstances even though he didn't want to be involved. Astin is even better as the hilariously oblivious Twoflower, who regards every disaster as yet another great adventure ("We're going to run out of world!" "I have to see that!").		And there's a talented supporting cast -- Curry chews the scenery with sneering aplomb, Karen David plays a humorously over-the-top dragon-lady, and Irons has a small but wonderful role as the chilly, efficient Vetinari. And of course, the brilliant Christopher Lee takes over as an increasingly disappointed Death.		"Colour of Magic" isn't as tightly directed as it could have been, but it still manages to be clever and quite amusing.

0,I can only recommend to everyone, even guys and men to watch this little movie only once. GAS FOOD LODGING is nothing less but A BEAUTIFUL TALE about coming of age, love, and caring despite all the little sticks in the wheels that might occur along the way.		A mother (Brooke Adams) tries to raise her 2 daughters alone in a deserted new Mexico town. The oldest one Trudi (Ion Skye)is a daydreamer, promiscuous young woman but when she happens to meet a young boy that will in return treat her as badly as she used to treat other guys, she's left with nothing but her mother (Not so much a role model). And her younger sister Shade (Fairuza Balk)who fantaisizes about love, and about finding a man for her mom while watching Mexican love stories in a deserted theater near her home. But Shade will too learn that love might hit you at the very moment, you thought you were full of it and it might not always be the first boy that a lady come across that will make them feel that way.		Later, Trudi meets a man and falls in love. She eventually falls pregnant but the man in question disappeared soon after that. And the two girls father (A STILL REALLY AMAZING JAMES BROLIN) reappears out of nowhere, offering Shade a ride home after she fled from a strange night out.		Directed by ALLISON LANDERS and landing FAIRUZA BALK the award for independant's best lead actress on its year of release, GAS FOOD LODGING has a whole lot to be acclaimed for. So my deepest congratulations to the whole talented team of workers on this one. This is a nice, touching little tale about coming of age in a small town in which everyone would feel the need to escape to find some freedom and fresh air. A little piece of art about caring for one an other. And this gorgeous little movie still touches me today.		9.5/10

0,Shakespearean actor Sir Donald Wolfit famously quipped, "Dying is easy; comedy is hard."  Jennifer Garner has enjoyed phenomenal success starring as Sydney Bristow is the superb action series ALIAS, but comedy acting is much more difficult than performing an action role.  The question with this film was whether Ms. Garner was going to be able to make the transition to comedy.  The verdict?  Quite well.  I don't want her to quit ALIAS, but I hope she takes another stab at comedy at some future point in her career.		The movie is basically BIG meets A CHRISTMAS CAROL.  A thirteen-old-girl, who like all teens yearns desperately for a host of things that seem important at the time.  After a particularly humiliating birthday party, she yearns to be thirty, and she gets her wish.  Jennifer Garner does a fine job of playing a thirteen-year-old girl trapped in a thirty-year-old's body.  She suffers by comparison with the extraordinary performance by Tom Hanks in BIG, but who wouldn't (I'm not aware of any comic actor ever who would have been more delightful in that role than Hanks).  But as the film goes along, it transforms from a female version of BIG to A CHRISTMAS CAROL, with Garner's character Jenna learning what a terrible person she has become, cut off from her parents, without having talked to her male best friend in seventeen years, ruthlessly stealing ideas from other people in her job, cheating on her boyfriend, sharing company secrets with another company, and just generally living a pretty rotten life.  Of course, we all know from the first seconds of the film that Jenna will get to go back and do her life over, getting it right this time.		There are a few scenes that are a bit too precious that I think could have been dispensed with, such as thirty-year-old Jenna giggling with a bunch of young teenaged girls, telling them about her kissing a guy.  But there were also a lot of fun scenes, and if as a whole it stretches credulity, this can be forgiven because the movie never pretends to be anything other than a fun time.  I especially enjoyed some of the scenes were grown up Jenna gets incredibly embarrassed by grown up behavior, such as when her self-absorbed hockey-playing boyfriend does a strip tease for her.		I enjoyed Mark Ruffalo as Jenna's thirteen-year-old male friend all grown up, and it was fun to see Andy Serkis in a role without CGI masking him (he memorably played Gollum in THE LORD OF THE RINGS) playing Jenna's boss.  The cast was not an especially strong one, but it was up to the task at hand.  The two main performers-Garner and Ruffalo-acquitted themselves well, and the teenaged actors playing them were convincing as younger versions.		This is not one of the great films ever made, but it is a very pleasant one.  I recommend it for an evening when you want to kick back, turn off your brain, and pass a pleasant couple of hours.
0,This movie is fun ! fun ! fun ! Johnny Depp steals the show as a nonreader who has  mastered the art of quirky entertaining. I've only seen it once, but in reading the reviews, I think I'll just have to see it again really  soon. I really wish there were more movies out there that are as sweetly  nutty!
0,Great for all ages and so sublime.  A beautiful piece of art.
0,Based on Darwyn Cooke's classic comic by the same name.  The animated adaption is hands down one of the best direct to video films WB has put out for DC properties.  It not only respects the source material, but makes for an entertaining adventure for DC fans of all Ages.
0,EXCELLENT
0,One of the best documentaries of its kind in some time and LIFE was included at a special package price.
0,It IS a beautiful story and Sean Patrick Flanery as the title character gives a marvellous performance.		Jeff Goldblum is, once again, Jeff Goldblum and you  can't ask for much better than that.		I've never been a huge fan of Mary Steenburgen but she was good in this. As for Lance Hendrickson and Ray Wise they always come through.		I'm not going to comment on Victor Salwa everyone else has done that.	I'll just say he owes God a debt and let it go at that.		Still I love Powder.

0,What can I say...all those washed out blurry episodes we watched and watched again on TV has now been reborn with the Blu-Ray...thank God for Blu-Ray!!!...this has cleaned up the whole image the quality is superb...get it!
0,good show
0,Wow! what a view of the Victorian era, This is a story about what  'Dickensian' characters can expect when they grow up A kind of underbelly view of merry old England which I'm sure was reflected here in America.
0,While this set may be lacking in the special features department (if you really care about that kinda thing) as far as the movies go they all look better than ever before. The films themselves may be a different story. These movies aren't for everyone, but if you are buying this trilogy you probably know what you're getting.		The first film was made under the American International imprint which was a Samuel Z Arkoff company known for making exploitation films. Arkoff was actually an acronym for a formula used to make these films, A for Action, R for Revolution, K for Killing, O for Oratory, F for Fantasy and lastly F for Fornication.		The first Mad Max film had all of these elements, but because of budgetary constraints and raw guerilla filmmaking, the quality of the product was not very high and felt more like and exploitation film than the others. After the cult success of the first movie, Warner Brothers acquired the rights to the Mad Max franchise and turned out 'The Road Warrior', certainly the best of the bunch.		Finally Beyond Thunderdome was released with the Hollywood presence was strongly felt with the casting of the well known diva Tina Turner (not to mention using her music to open and close the film). All in all it's a good set but fanatics may want a bit more.
0,We really enjoyed this movie.  Any grandparent can relate to it.  Paranoia about the 'other grandparents', not feeling like you know your own kids and grandkids, etc.  Also, trying to do it all for them while coping with the ups and downs of your own life.  It was great.  Having established great actors in it didn't hurt one bit.
0,Wow!  These stories are pretty fascinating.  Lots of action and intrigue, too.  Holds your interest all the way thru.  I particularly enjoyed all of the background scenery from all of the cities/countries where these movies were shot.  Jason Bourne really 'got around!'
0,Of the many versions of A Christmas Carol or "Scrooge" by Charles Dickens, this one has become a favorite.  Has a different slant than the other versions but delivers the same powerful message.  Many versions take poetic license with Dicken's book, but this version enhances the story.
0,Very touching film about a subject which everyone has confronted in their lives at one time or another: bigotry. Charlie (the bigot) is able to over come this shortcoming, and it changes (and saves) his life. Very well done film. I disagree with those who call this a "chick flick". It is not. What it is is a heartwarming story that both men and women can enjoy. To Annabella Piugattuk I say "well done". This was your first film role and ya nailed it kid. To anyone who wants to "Fill Your Heart" may I suggest that you fill your DVD tray with this film...you will TRUELY be glad that you did.
0,Love the old movies special Elizabeth Taylor!
0,The REAL deal.
0,Sophia Loren was perfect. She was so natural and one gets the feeling that they are actually a part of this horror called war WW11 was before my time but this movie brings into clarity the results of wars and what some of the implications may be for all of us as we continue in the world we live today.
0,i bought this dvd only seeing a trailer for it on my samurai 7 collection. let me tell you it was well worth the risk and the dollar. this is a very dark comedy style of anime. it stars a young hero (in a sense) forging his way through life in a desolate desert. his only companion is his trusty shotgun and bag of tricks. don't be fooled though he also encounters other forms of life that spark his lustful interests and his undying thirst for money. i will say this about the desert punk he is quite perverted so if you don't like anime with bouncing breasts every 5 minutes this probably isn't for you. there's also a big piece of the description of desert punk that i'm leaving out but that's for you to find out. it's very suprising. i highly recommend this for any adult anime collector.
0,Great show!
0,Clifford finds a jet pack that can strap around your back and make a man fly, not knowing that federal agents from the owner wants it back before mobsters hired by a unknown natzi wants to get his hands on it and create a new war with americans and to take over. An entertaining comic book movie that for the life of me didn't do well back in 1991, its a feel good movie with well written charectors, good story & special effects, great music score, packs a good winning combination. Worth checking out.
0,This is a Stallone classi, and that's why I can't give it 5-stars. Good action, who speeds up with time, great mountain scenarios, good adaptation from the boook.
0,Another classic WCW/NWA event that I was able to get my hands on. Most wrestling fans that have been around for a long time can argue that the NWA's run during the late 80s especially during the year of 1989 was the best run that the company had when it came to high quality wrestling matches that really became an alternative to the sports entertainment that WWF was doing at the time.		Z-Man vs Mike Rotunda. Z-Man is actually Tom Zenk while Rotunda was the man that would go on to be "I.R.S." during his WWF run. Besides that, this was just an average opener that was nothing really memorable but watchable.		The Midnight Express & "Dr. Death" Steve Williams vs The Samoan Swat Team. The crowd was heavily into this match as Dr. Death was really over at this point in his career & even showcased his dominance over the Samoans whenever he was in the ring. A good match to watch as it not only did it's job in continuing the tension between Jim Cornette & the Express but was so well done in getting Williams over.		Tommy Rich vs The Cuban Assassin. This was just another match that came off as a filler & was nothing memorable or special about it.		NWA Tag Team Champions The Fabulous Freebirds vs The Dynamic Dudes. An interesting fact to point out about this match was that even though the Freebirds were the heels, they were being wildly cheered by the crowd since the Dudes just weren't getting over with that stupid gimmick that they had. Besides that, this was a solid tag team match as both teams worked well together & the atmosphere was very interesting to hear as well.		The Steiner Brothers vs Doom. This was the debut of the tag team of Doom that was lead by Woman (Nancy Benoit, RIP) while Ron Simmons & Butch Reed were the ones that were under the mask. Anyone that knows me knows that I loved the Steiners when they were in their prime & this match continued to showcase that as this was a great tag team match with both teams taking turns to control the action including Doom cutting off the ring & double-teaming with the referee's back turned. The ending involved Woman getting involved that lead to a series of matches between both teams but this one lived up to the expectations going in.		United States Champion Lex Luger vs Brian Pillman. This was one of those matches where one man completely carried this match from start to finish as Pillman really showed just how great in the ring he really was as he dominated Luger. Pillman used his speed & quickness to out-wrestle Luger by working on the arm & even using his high-flying ability while Luger tried to use his power to try to take control of the action. It was a good match but again, that was thanks to the effort of Brian Pillman than Luger.		The Road Warriors vs The Skyscrapers. The beginning of their fued started here as this was probably the best match in the history of Skyscrapers as Sid & Spivey held their own against Hawk & Animal. A very good stiff contest between both teams with Sid actually showing more athleticism here than he is known for while Spivey used his power to clash with the Warriors. The ending was sort of a jip but it really didn't take away from a good match between both teams.		Thunderdome Cage Match: Sting & Ric Flair w/Ole Anderson vs Terry Funk & The Great Muta w/Gary Hart along with Special Referee Bruno Sammartino. Before I begin, I just want to mention that I never noticed before but the Thunderdome Cage looked very similar to the Hell in a Cell except that it was a bit smaller. Anyways, the rules of this match was that for the match to end, the cornerman must throw the towel in for his team which would result in submission for his team. This was a wild encounter that really started to pick up some steam as time went on with moments to look out for like Sting & Flair using the cage to their advantage, Sting swinging around the cage into Terry Funk, Muta putting out a fire near the top of the cage with his green mist that was kinda funny, the wild exchange between Flair & Funk along with Ole Anderson, Gary Hart & even Bruno Sammartino getting involved in the action as well.		Overall, this was a classic show from the NWA although I did enjoy Great American Bash & Starrcade from this same year more, this is still one event that I would recommend to check out as again, it was a classic show.

0,Great film.  Well written, casted and acted.  A nice, entertaining film that is well crafted and fun to watch unfold.
0,Aroused by a fanatical Moorish warlord, emir-king attack a Castilian village, where they are captured by Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar...		Vigorously brave and compassionate, the noble Rodrigo hates bloodshed and vows to see his country at peace, frees the prisoners on their solemn pledge never again to attack Castile...		For this act of courage and mercy, one of the Emirs, Moutamin, calls Rodrigo "El Cid," and pledges eternal friendship to the Cid of Vivar... And so, in freeing the Moors, Rodrigo, accidentally, stumbled onto a battle, not to his luscious bride, but to a battle that will change his whole life...		In the court of King Ferdinand, Rodrigo's act of clemency is misinterpreted, and he's accused of treason by his rival Don Ordonez for refusing to turn over to him the captures Moors...		Unfortunately, Rodrigo's aged father, Don Diego, is slapped by the Champion of the king, Count Gormaz, father of his beloved Chimene... Rodrigo begs Gormaz an apology; it is refused... A duel begins and the champion is badly wounded... Before he dies, however, he asks Chimene to avenge his death...		Chimene's wish is fulfilled when King Ramiro of Aragon challenges King Ferdinand for the possession of the city of Calahorra by the outcome of a single combat...El Cid convinces the king to permit him to fight Don Martin...Thus, according to the custom of trial by combat, God would judge Rodrigo's guilt or innocence...		"El Cid" is an intense film, lavish and spectacular, bigger than any in terms of cast and impressive as any in visual terms... Mikls Rzsa gave a new dimension to the emotion that Anthony Mann was trying to express...		Mann gives us a human story with a love story balanced with the most strongly image of a hero the world has ever seen... He presented a man of honor who thinks always of his wife, his country, and his king first... Even in death, his thoughts are for others and not himself...		El Cid insults kings and noblemen in the name of justice and integrity and does what he knows to be right... He battles the king's living sword in respect of his father... He accepts the challenge of a champion of a king to prove himself innocent of treason and other things... He shows a prince how any man can kill and only a king can give life... He fights 13 knights, at the same time, to free a prisoner... Yet he is in addition to all of this an extremely principled leader... He accepts exile for life from the country he loves, and yet he is the only man in Spain who 'could humble a king and would give a leper to drink from his own pouch...'		The joust sequence called "The fight for Calahorra," is perhaps the most rousing, exciting, one-to-one combat ever filmed... The battle scenes at Valencia are taken on an epic scale... But the value of Anthony Mann's movie is the characterization in which Charlton Heston played El Cid's life... For this reason alone, the film is of greater value than most any other motion picture experience...
0,thought this movie would be cheesy but it was very good!
0,Although I am not a Scary movies's Fan,I've bought Evil Dead Trilogy,They're Funny,Scary And The greatest Horror movies I've ever Seen Since The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,Simply BUY'EM AND ADD'EM TO YOUR COLLECTION :p
0,Classic.
0,expanding our holiday movie collection -
0,Just a great show to watch anywhere - Glad to watch this show once again. I love this awesome show.
0,One of the better nick cage movies. It's a more realistic version of a super hero movie and looks great on Blu ray.
0,Very funny movie!
0,Just as described.
0,Such an amazing, yet disheartening movie. I feel so ashamed to be a part of the human race when I see stories like this. The things we do to such amazing people just because we can't accept differences. I can only hope that we finally grow beyond such petty judgements before too many other great minds are sacrificed.
0,This is the story of Lance Armstrong and is based on the book by journalist David Walsh called "Seven Deadly Sins: My Pursuit of Lance Armstrong". Walsh worked for The Sunday Times and is played by the brilliant Chris ODowd in the film. Walsh was one of the few who questioned the phenomenal rise of Armstrong from mediocre hill climber to King of the mountains and unbeatable in The Tour de France.		Now the story is full of lies and deceit and evil doings and as such you would think it was full of Machiavellian twists  but no; it seems a bit flat to be honest. The story is interesting but seems to lack the oomph moments to bring it to anything approaching a dramatic crescendo.		I think half the problem is that we all know the story by now and so there is not that much to reveal and we have already gotten truly over our initial shock and disgust at what was a crime the perpetuated for years and corrupted so many  so called- athletes. Having said all that I really enjoyed it. Ben Foster puts in an excellent performance as the duplicitous Armstrong and was even convincing in the cancer bits and the double dealing lies. So one that rises from being above ok but do not expect to be blown away.
0,The strife between man building machine and machine reshaping man will be continuing until the day when it actually happens. This movie simply examines, and I do mean simply, the probability of a future when our constructs no longer need us. While that is not a new premise, It is a great look into what might happen if no safeties for the promotion of human existence get built into life. This film is more about a relationship between an engineer and his construct.  Again, that is not an original idea but this movie certainly entertains with blood - and love. The acting was captured well, most of the time, and the machine certainly captivates in several ways. I liked the movie enough to buy the Blue Ray after.
0,This flick is hilarious. Price and Lorre are comic geniuses and it's a shame they didn't make more. Karloff seems to be having as much fun as the others.	The story has nothing to do with Poe's poem. Price and Lorre are socerors, as is Karloff. The three are engaged in magical war while Lorre's son, Jack Nicholson, falls for Price's daughter, adding the romantic interest.	The laughs come fast and furious, ranging from slapstick to pithy sayings. It's about as far from horror as one can get.	It also shows that the horror genre was declining, awaiting Hammer's revival of the classic horror characters.
0,This show is a hoot.  The film is not quite up to current standards but it's still fun to watch.  I did not realize, back when it first aired, what a thinly disguised lesbian show this was.  And the fact that the series is so campy while playing it all straight makes it even more fun to watch.  Lucy Lawless is perfect in this show.  I can't imagine anybody else playing the part.  Great series
0,Great price for a blu-ray set. A total of 9 discs are included and loaded with extras. While X-Men: The Last Stand is by far the most inferior of the trilogy, there are tons of features including deleted and alternate scenes, scenes filmed with characters in different costumes, extended fight sequences and even a scene where Storm creates a massive wave. It's worth every penny.
0,Picture quality and audio are great. Special features are good. Would recommend anyone who enjoys the franchise to purchase this Blu-ray.
0,One of my favorite series of all times!  Unless I was at my students' football games, I was in front of he television laughing hysterically.  Ordered DVD'S for granddaughters--reba at her best!!!!!
0,never saw this movie before, enjoyed it, Ordered it to share with a friend. good acting, I was proud of the gal for the way it ended!
0,Saw this movie way back when I was in high school.  Wanted to add this to my collection as I loved it then.  Love it now too.
0,This is  a delightful cast and while some may write it off prematurely as just another cocoon, this movie has a charming theme and Maggie Smith adds razor edged charm to everything she stars in.
0,This was a good movie one that you can watch a few times.
0,This video is of a live concert Damn Yankees gave at the Rocky Mountain Jam in Denver.  Directed by Larry Jordan, who's also done concert videos for Rush, the live concert film is interspersed with "behind the scenes" footage of this supergroup collaborating on their second album "Don't Tread."  Basically, it's a lot of gags with drummer Michael Cartellone busting chops on how old Jack Blades, Tommy Shaw and Ted Nugent are, and the rest of the band's observations on how eccentric wild man Nugent is.	Damn Yankees was one supergroup that had great chemistry, so it was a shame that they never put out an album after "Don't Tread." Perhaps it was in the cards: Damn Yankees was the last great hair band to form (yep, they came out after Warrant, though the latter's "Cherry Pie" was officially Heavy Metal's swan song), and the mostly forgetable grunge movement wiped out everything groups like DY had built up.	But, hey, don't let the group's unfortunate timing stop you from seeing and hearing this video; DY wails on hit after hit.  Jack Blades and, especially, Tommy Shaw shoe they've got the vocal chops to kick rear on power ballads like "Come Again" and "Silence is Broken."  But the best are the heavy hitting slammers such as "Damn Yankees," "Don't Tread" and Nugent's paean to the spirit of all things American, the eagle, the vigilante and the American Indian who once rode the Great Plains, "Uprising."	This video is one of the best concert films I've seen, and the musicianship of lead guitarist Nugent, the acoustic rhythms of Shaw, the jackhammer bass of Blades and the frenetic drumming of Cartellone really work well in tandem.	They save the best for last, doing DY's unique versions of Styx's (Shaw's old band) "Renegade," Night Ranger's (Blade's band) "Rock in America," and -- of course -- Ted's mainstay, "Cat Scratch Fever."	Ted being the inimitable Ted, the concert ends with him shooting an arrow right at Saddam Hussein's groin!  We need to bring back this great hair band, if only to send a flaming arrow at Osama bin Laden's forehead.
0,Really enjoyed it.
0,love it
0,Really funny and fun to watch. Although I am not in favor of killing, this farce was hilarious.
0,Awesome disc and transaction. Thanks.
0,I can't wait to watch all of battle dimension! Even though they don't make complete season box sets, you can buy these at a reasonable price now. If you buy box sets 1, 2 and 3, then you will have all of Battle Dimension. On here, Amazon lists them as "Vols. 1 & 2" (which is all of BOX SET 1), then "Vols. 3 & 4" (which is all of BOX SET 2), followed by Box 3 (which is all of BOX SET 3). If you are a Pokemon fan and enjoy the anime and want to complete some dvd box sets, buy these. Like I said before, these are reasonably priced now. So enjoy!		Also, if you have Pokemon Indigo League (3 box sets), Orange Islands (1 box set), Master Quest (2 box sets), Advanced (2 box sets), Battle Frontier (2 box sets), and Diamond and Pearl (3 box sets) then you must have a lot of shelf room because all together these box sets do take up a lot of space. After you get through Galactic Battles (the next season after this) then the sets get thinner to save space.
0,This is a great series. I finally have all of them, I think. I hope they make some more of this series. I will be watching for more.
0,I watched it with my grandson a couple of days before we rode the Polar Express in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park System. It was a fabulous thing to do to get him ready for this experience. He is 6 years old.
0,fantastic as expected
0,This Season has some of the best episodes with the most memorable characters, such as Jimminy Lummox and Powdered Toast man!  I have the first 2 seasons so this is the perfect addition!
0,This stands up to the De Laurentis movie version - closer to the book.  The best looking Irulan of any version.  I have collected all the versions I could find and have been happy with all of them
0,Wish I'd watched this when it was on HBO.  Very good...violent at times.  You see the evil that gets the prisoners through the day mirrored by the evil on the outside...by the politicians and correction officers.  They use the same lies and treachery.  You will not believe how many stars there are in this....they weren't stars then, but they are now.  Lots of male nudity and harsh language so if that bothers you, don't watch this. The story lines have several ongoing plots by different characters.  Binge watching lets you follow these without forgetting who did what to whom.
0,Loved it
0,The Adventures of Robin Hood...this is, in my opinion, one of the best movies ever made.  This Academy Award winning film flawlessly tells a story based on English legend, about Robin of Locksley (Errol Flynn), a noble Saxon forced to take up arms against the Normans as the Prince John, the king's brother, tries to take the throne in his King Richard's absence.	In turning outlaw, Robin's following grows, as the Normans levy harsh taxes and exact brutal retribution against the Saxon population if they are unable to sate the greedy and uncaring reign of Prince John, played by Claude Rains.  Basil Rathebone plays Sir Guy of Gisbourne, a Norman noble supporting Prince John's absconding of the throne and vying for the hand in marriage of Maid Marion, a charge in the King's care, who falls in love with Robin once she sees that he is no mere thief, but a protector and provider of the people being oppressed by her Norman countrymen.	This film is a perfect example of every element of a movie coming together.  The immaculate direction, perfect casting, exquisite music score, sharp and witty dialogue, beautifully expansive sets and scenery and highly detailed, colorful  costumes...you are literally transported back to the 12th century as the movie draws you in and keeps your attention throughout.  Errol Flynn becomes Robin, with his sly smile and cheerfully upbeat nature, even in the face of such adversity.  The lovely Olivia deHavilland is Maid Marian, with her expressive eyes and loving nature.  Claude Rains brings to life the character of Prince Richard perfectly, as the back stabbing opportunist trying to steal the throne.  My favorite though has to be Basil Rathebone as Sir Guy of Gisbourne.  He really creates a character the viewer loves to hate.	Given this was a 65th anniversary release of the movie from Warner Brothers, I was very pleased to see that they did right by the film.  Not known for their including special features, Warner Brothers provides so many wonderful bits including making of features, outtakes, a look at other screen adaptations of the Robin Hood story, classic cartoons, historical materials, photo galleries, and so much more.  I have only touched the tip of the iceberg, so to speak, so view the product page to see a complete listing.  One thing I found exceptionally interesting was the recreation of a night at the movies, basically allowing us to see what it was like to go to the movies back in the late 30's, presenting newsreels, a cartoon, and other goodies prior to showing the feature.  Quite an interesting experience to see how the movies were actually a full night of entertainment for people back in the day.	If you like spectacular epics with thrilling action and adventure, with a dash of comedic element, then this movie is for you.  Heck, if you like movies in general, then treat yourself and your family, as they just don't get any better than this.	Cookieman108
0,4 giants of the movie world,Walter Brennan, Andy Devine,Edgar Buchanan and Pat O'Brien present one of the most hilarious films ever made. For collectors of Comedy Classics, not having this movie in their collection is a miss of a lifetime
0,The 10th Kingdom is a fantastic, classic, awesome, funny, cool, adventurous, and long movie! It is one of my favorite movies of all-time! I absolutely love it!!!!!!!
0,Best of Yash Chopra
0,First, this idea would have been enough to fill a 75 minute, and maybe a 90 minute time slot.  Unfortunately, they had two hours of TV time (94 minutes sans commercials) to use up.		Second, Judith Baldwin was adequate as Ginger, but Tina Louise was Ginger, even if she wanted nothing to do with reunions.  By the way, I think its neat that the surviving original cast (excluding Louise) seem to be close and enjoy being together.  It showed in this.  And Bob Denver is at his best.		Third, when my wife and I watched this, it has been years since seeing the original, and she didn't think the original was that silly; I pointed out it was.  But that is the best thing about it:  it was designed for those who loved the original, and it fit the bill.		Fourth, this movie clearly illustrates the goal of the series.  The cast consisted of people from all walks of lives, and how people can learn to get along with each other.		Fifth, when it got going, this movie had great ideas.  What interested me about this was it dealt with the characters adjusting to real life, and it did that very well.  The other plot, the Russians trying to get the disk back from Gilligan, was hilarious, and Vincent Schiavelli and Art LeFleur were excellent as Dimitri and Ivan.		Sixth, the ending was designed to allow for more reunion movies.  Nothing more.  And that was disappointing.
0,Was a Gift
0,This is a great series, intelligent, funny and creative.  The characters are colorful and multidimensional and there is never a dull moment.  As a fan of SG1 and science fiction, Farscape is at the top.  The set itself is beautifully cased in a quality dvd holder, the best I have seen.  This is well worth your time and money.
0,A must have DVD
0,I love these creatures  I use to watch them on YouTube until some hammerhead dubbed over every one of them now BBC has fixed them only with a theater like seating and I was so disappointed then I found them on amazon! love the sommerwine series!
0,came as described. nice packaging. The actors & actresses are great in these movies.	No scratches on the DVD's. Nice extras.
0,I didn't think it was going to be as good as the original, but it is. Love the 3D added effects. A must have for movie nights.
0,Love the movie despite William Hurt's attempt at an accent
0,Damn it feels good to be a gangster...  GREAT movie!
0,The first time I watched this movie, it was a little hard to follow. Once it got to the end, It was like my mind was blown. So of course I'm going to watch it a second time!! Great Movie!
0,Another great season of Night Court.  Comedy is great, the sound and video quality is good.  I can not find a reason to not have this DVD set as a part of my collection.  Thanks Amazon for making the purchase of this DVD set possible.
0,There are several movies about Hitler's last days in the bunker in April, 1945, and this is certainly a good one.  Alec Guinness plays a very convincing Hitler, both in looks and action.  The film includes contrasts between the luxuries enjoyed by Hitler and his elites down in the bunker, and the common people suffering from starvation and devastation in the city streets above (actual footage).  The Eva Braun character is developed throughout the film, with her youthfulness and devotion to Hitler.
0,Visually stunning. However, this film suffers from an identity crisis. It is a fairy tale. A real Grimm's Brother's tale--not some Disneyfied feel good animated adventure. Like the Grimm's original tales, it is full of darkness, shadows and things that go bump in the night. But also, it is a film full of the wonder of being a child.		Unlike most fairy tales, it lacks a moral or lesson; and the film is so full of graphic violence and blood shed, no adult in their right mind would take their kid to see it. And there you have this film's real failing. It doesn't know who its audience is. If the blood and violence had been toned down a bit and it's message more clearly defined it could have easily been one of the greatest children's fairy tales of all time.		Perhaps Del Toro feels people wouldn't take his work seriously if he made a children's film. And so he brings in the Nazi's and politics and all sorts of adult rubbish, splashes them all over his film and says "hey, it's ok for you to watch it. It's an adult fairy tale now." And, in this he almost succeeds.		Underneath the muck and filth of the adult world that surrounds her, the innocent and fantastic imaginings of a young girl remind us once again what it is like to be a child again. But these moments are few and fleeting, flashes of something greater in a film soiled by the ordinary. It comes so close at times, it makes me wonder whether it is just a fluke, or if Del Toro just failed miserably at bringing his latest work out of the fog of budgets, deadlines, and Hollywood profiteering.		However you look at it, this film is less then the sum of its parts. However, some parts are worth watching just for themselves. The Fawn for instance is simply . . . well, amazing. In an industry drowning in a sea of computer graphics, this simple earthy and real looking creation is just breathtaking. When I saw the trailer for the film, this was what drew me to it. Also, the fairy tale itself, following the classical framework of tales hundreds of years old is also, ironically, refreshing.		For the eyes, a thumbs up. For the collection, a thumbs down.
0,Again this is a subject that is of interest to me and I find all the movies regarding the 2 of there lives interesting to watch.
0,This is a fun series; however, it has no definite ending.
0,Like a horrible car wreck, you can't look away from as you pass by; this show demands your attention! Delightfully gruesome and strangely erotic, Jessica Lang steals the show! CREEPY! Wonderful!
0,Great cinematographer, music and scenery.
0,Great movie.  He was incredible
0,We got the 3rd season to add to our collection. We plan to obtain the rest of the seasons in the future. We enjoy the complete seasons. I always tell family & friends.....if you want someting......GO TO AMAZON
0,I love it but I love the hobbit series. I felt that this movie explain about the whole series and I would recommend this movie for not only hobbit fanatics but for everyone.
0,My husband is an American History buff and the two of us have loved watching John Adams.  The acting is wonderful and it has been very well set.  The part of John's wife is particularly good.  She represents a very strong woman and it is easy to see how she was an excellent match for John.  She is intelligent, articulate and knows when to counsel him.  I would recommend this series to anyone that loves American History.  I have no idea if this is supposed to be just one season or if there will be more but I'm all for as much as they give us.
0,Love all the episodes!!!!!!
0,Excellent.
0,Solid, well done western, with an elegiac, muted, deliberately paced feel, despite the tense plot.		A cowboy (Randolph Scott) `buys back' a stolen white woman from the Comanche's.  We quickly learn that other men are	searching for her too - there's a reward of $5000 for her return.  But Scott doesn't seem like a mercenary, unlike the three	men he's forced into joining up with after an Native American ambush.		Claude Akins plays Scott's opposite.  A man with no heart, for whom money is everything.  He has two young sidekicks, both	little more than kids, who seem to have fallen in with Akins mostly for having little other choices in life.		The film is always interesting, even if it feels pretty predictable about where it ends up.  There are a couple of good,	surprising twists however.  This lacks the moral complexity of Boetticher's earlier `Decision at Sundown', but it's better shot and acted.
0,Very well done.
0,One of Terry Gilliam's  best. I was very disappointed that my version had bilingual (English-French) packaging. Be on the lookout for that.
0,While not one of Pixar's finest films (Up, WALL-E, Toy Story), Brave is a hilarious, rousing, visually stunning, well-acted, beautifully crafted, excellent film for the whole family!	Four Brilliant Stars!
0,This was something I didn't expect to watch to completion, but it drew me in. You have a family who believes that they know Diane intimately and cannot reconcile what happened on that parkway. And perhaps they're right. Money can only go so far though, and their resources are limited. I applaud both Jay and Danny in their perseverance - I would want to know as well. All in all, I'm undecided, and would like a more in depth investigation of Diane Schuler's mental and physical state prior to the accident.
0,Watch these flicks in all their black and white glory back in the day on Saturday fright night tv. The colorization is well done but still can watch in glorious b/w. The figure is an added wonderful bonus. The stop motion effects are far better than the cold lifeless CGI stuff done today.  I highly recommend this set and even my young daughter enjoys the flicks.
0,Came fast brand new i think if they make more of these they will make some real dough...i love this movie its not the best Texas but as a 3 to 4 movie set it could have somthing
0,The third season raises the stakes and outdoes its previous seasons. With twists and turns it introduces lovable new characters and reveals some interesting tidbits about some of our heroes and the world as a whole's past.
0,It came in excellent condition.
0,This movie was cheap and worth more. It shows life before a family and as a super family! It is a good movie and my son loves it and I enjoy watching it on occasion as well. Between strong man, invisible girl, and some other fun characters this is one you can watch as a family.
0,Hysterical! There is no reason for you to not laugh your butt off, watching this!  Just make sure the kids are not around.
0,it has been ages since i saw this movie.it was when it first came out in the theaters.i saw this at least 3 times back then.i love al pacino such a great actor.i completely forgot this was a true story.if you are an al pacino fan YOU have to get this movie! it is serious but it is funny or i just have a wierd sence of humor.all the acting in this movie is fantastic.the scene where you see all coming out of the bank and talking to the police and the people waving the white hankerchief is identical to he actual film footage from the news reale they show of the actual robbery. they captured it in detail. i just think this is one of al pacinos best works. i guess he has sandra seacat to thank for prepping him in his career.
0,Love it
0,cute movie
0,Billy Bob Thorton is an actor that creates a rare psychological effect in the movies he makes. In his best roles (1998's A Simple Plan, 2001's Monster's Ball, this movie) he is so understated and so quietly graceful that the movie goes on around him and the awareness that a great actor is before us disappears. In Friday Night Lights, Thorton occupies such a low-key wavelength that I'm still wondering why he got that starring credit. It's a testament to the pitch-perfect casting of the film, and the wonderful young actors who play the roles, that any supporting player could have had his name in bold on the poster and it would have made sense.		  In Lights, Thorton is coach Gary Gaines, the mastermind behind the football juggernaut in Odessa Texas: the Permian Panthers. Gaines is at the head of a team with state championships under its belt, a gigantic reputation in its desolated surroundings, and a football stadium that dwarfs everything within miles of it. This is not Gaines' movie, though; Lights wisely focuses in on the young men who make up the team and the way their lives shape what goes into the game. The best performance of the movie belongs to quarterback Mike Winchell (Lucas Black), whose precise Texas drawl and shy personality make for a fascinating contrast with the louder guys on the team. Speaking of louder guys: there's Derek Luke of Antwone Fisher who plays Boobie Miles, the superstar of the team who gets a little life lesson of his own once the season begins.		  It's actual history, the fall of 1988, but David Aaron Cohen's adaptation of the book by H.G. Bissinger brings the inhabitants of the team and the town alive so that a real narrative progresses before your eyes. But the central idea behind Lights that you might have before seeing it is misleading: this is not a movie about a triumphant football team who starts a losing streak and has it all come down to a defining moment at state championships. Lights is a bittersweet tale of the disappointment, uncertainty, and occasional bleakness that accompanies a life totally consumed by a sport. The movie doesn't turn a head away from the fact that, yeah, some football players can't read really well (a particularly triumphant moment in my own mind :) ), they often go on to drive trucks and sell insurance instead of playing pro ball, and sometimes things are such a damn letdown you can't do anything but yank off your helmet and crash into a ball of heaving sobs.		  Friday Night Lights has moments of searing brilliance, propelled forward with an atmospheric musical score, but in the end it fails to make that final leap into greatness that it could have. I can't help but admire this film, though, for its bravery in the story that it has to tell. This is not the uplifting sports movie that will run over and over again on TBS a few years from now. This is a 'sports movie' that I thought about for quite a while after leaving the theater. With football, it seems it's all about winning; what Friday Night Lights makes us realize is that there's often more loss, in the very deepest sense of the word. B+
0,Received it fast. Love this.
0,A classic.
0,I love this collection of The Good Witch and I really enjoy watching These movies, I just can't get enough of this show!	I highly recommend The Good Witch Collection from Hallmark Movies.
0,everything was fine.
0,It's true what everyone says - this is a fantastic movie.  The choice to put Helen in as the Queen was superb.  She does a brilliant job and sometimes you almost can't believe that she isn't the real Queen.  Tony Blair was also really well cast and the actor did a fantastic job in looks and voice.		It doesn't always show the Queen in good light.  She made some poor decisions after Diana's death.  She took her sweet time in addressing the public and she didn't lower the flag at the Palace among other things.  It shows some real footage from news bulletins and a little of the funeral prossesion and it kept William and Harry away from the spotlight (therefore keeping some of their privacy).		There is fantastic acting in this and one thing I really liked about this is that it gives you a semi real glimpse into the mysterious life of a bizzare family and what happened behind the scenes after the death of their former daughter-in-law, wife and mother.  I really liked it and I was glad to finally get around to watching it yesterday.  I can't believe it took me so long.  I highly recommend it.
0,I didn't think I would like the two new members but they grew on me and they were very likeable added characters!
0,Fast cars. The girls...Originally, I didn't like this. I remember leaving the theater feeling disappointed, that the special effects much less story were over the top.		Now in the advent of the Daniel Craig era, 007 minus frills or thrills, it's nice to see a movie which allows James Bond to just actually have SOME fun.		Die Another Day's invisible car & flirty play vs. Skyfall's komodo dragon & sobbing all around..eh I'll take Peirce on this. :-)
0,Excellent
0,Cute movie for the time.
0,Now I have all the seasons.  Waiting to get the 6th season for my collection.
0,Great movie.
0,This movie introduces us to the secret life of plants. Awesome picture and very apt to all audiences. A little slow towards the end. Great and entertaining in all aspects!!
0,prefect!
0,Ahhhnold at his self-deprecating best, a parody of out-of-nowhere explosions, bodies flying around, and cars crashing for no apparent reason. If you like Arnold, you'll love this one.

0,Consider this one as the best of Lon Chaney silent films . Never before and hardly since there has been a version so magnificently mounted and idiomatic expressive , and personally I guess the plot fits adequately to mude movies , due his own nature allows . A musician hides in the bowels of a cavernous opera house waiting for his revenge moment . You had to wait until 1974 for De Palma to obtain a worthable second place  FORTY NINE YEARS after . But is more than just to recognize the enormous and expert merit made by Claude Rains in the 1943 version .		The makeup is silmply magic . Directed by Rupert Julian a real and forgotten master director.		A personal advise to get involved in this surrealist mood ; watch first The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari , The hands of Orlac at first , and once you are completely in expressionist waters , watch it . Otherwise , if you watch without the necessary requirements about the artistic meaning and certain visual , cinematic and light and shadows affects clues , may be you make a wrong statement . due a breakthrough with the fundaments of this genre
0,Excellent movie - very matrix-like but (imo) much better - very underrated movie.
0,Son got us watching.  95% of episodes are fantastic.  Later season (3rd and beyond) are BETTER than the first two years.
0,I liked some of the shows on Season 5. I use them to fall asleep after I take my sleeping pill.
0,My girls are both ostensibly beyond the age-range for Peppa and her family, but them so I am. This doesn't matter. Peppa Pig is so charming, so delightful warm and breezy that it is hard for me to imagine much of anybody at any age not being won over after a couple of episodes. The secret, to me, is that gentle and friendly as they are, they are completely devoid of mawkishness and sugary sentiment.		The humor is often sly, though never of the this-is-for-the-grown-ups-and-the-kids-won't-get-it variety. If you spend any time around little kids, you know good and well that there is a lot of overlapping sense of humor and Peppa does a nice job of this while never coming within miles of snark, sarcasm or mean spirit. Peppa and her family are, quite simply, wonderful.

0,fantastic
0,Heard about it on Drinkin' Bros Podcast. Great film!
0,...I didn't even mind the beginning of this season, although it certainly seemed to irk others.  I blew through the DVD set in 3 days -- I couldn't get enough.  Highly recommended.
0,This is a real classic.  The music is perfect and really adds to each scene.  The audio tracks sounds great and enhances the action.
0,I like it a lot.
0,Slow start but then started to get interesting. A very good movie and it is worth watching.
0,A good follow up for the first one.  Even better then the first one.  Only the cartoon GI Joes never died, right.
0,What a gift to be able to see a Tennessee Williams work that hadn't been produced before. Strong performances by Chris Evans and Bryce Dallas Howard. I enjoyed this film very much.
0,This  is a terrific movie and it always makes me wonder why Dan Ackroyd didn't make more great movies. Oh, he made a lot of films, but none has been the equal of this. Much of the success of this film is due to Eddie Murphy, of course, but still, Ackroyd seems to be acting at a much higher level in this film. There are a few weak points in the script and some bits that seemed cobbled together just to get them at a good ending (the train scene on New Year's eve is what I'm talking about), but overall this is a great film.		I think this should also be on everyone's Christmas movie list because some key elements take place around the holidays.
0,Love this movie. Scares the crap out of me every time.
0,The story of every fighter is fantastic
0,Terminator 2 is a more mainstream, thoughtful sequel to 1984's "The Terminator." Whereas Terminator 2, was a dark, horrific, brutal film, T2 is more about the theme of the future of humanity in a nuclear era.  Blessed with a huge budget and a superb script Cameron successfully turns  the tables on Arnie's character and Sarah Connor's developing relationship  with the Terminator. Also effective is John Connor's development into the  leader he becomes in the future during the film.	Previously only  available on special edition laserdisc, the DVD ultimate edition adds much  more background and detail to the story. As with Aliens, the 15 or so extra  minutes of footage add mainly depth to the characters, for example, the  Terminator learning to smile, Miles Dyson's family, and the T-1000 taking  pleasure in killing a dog. This is unlike "The Abyss" with the  half an hour which adds a whole new storyline at the end!	As with all  Cameron films the sound is amazing, really sharp, clear thumping sound  although the Brad Fiedel soundtrack is a bit wimpy in comparison to a James  Horner or Jerry Goldsmith score. It does work well - the dark synth score  fits with the metallic machinations. Expect the picture quality to be  amazing!	What would have made this release perfect is if was presented in  full screen as well as 16:9. As Cameron filmed it in Super 35 you miss some  of the film in widescreen and some of it in full screen (unlike pan and  scan). So, it looks like I'll still be using my full screen laserdisc for  sometime to come! All we need now is for them to go back to the original  Terminator film and remix the sound from Mono into Dolby 5.1!	Brilliant!  Buy it!
0,Old time favorite. Always makes u laugh
0,Be content with such things as you have, is the message of this movie. It's pretty cute. Our kids really liked it and so did we, as parents. I recommend any of the VeggieTales that are neither 1) the Netflix original Veggies in the House, based on the characters of Veggie Tales, nor 2) the new VeggieTales movies that use the same animation and characters from Netflix's Veggies in the House.
0,fAIRLY NICE MOVIE FOR A QUIET EVENING.

0,Great movie
0,It was very scary ....it really hit home and made you pray it NEVER happens again.  The people who filmed it had the guts to it the raw emotion down on film.  I'll keep this dvd for as long as I live.
0,The number one reason for the success of this series is Lynda Carter as the title character.  She is the perfect embodiment of the comic book character.  She was obviously born for the part.  The scripts are rather weak, tho, but the actors played their parts straight, and the guest stars were a boost.  Still, a fun show to watch.
0,Samuel Fuller's "Pickup on South Street" is an outrageously entertaining mashup of film noir conventions and the Red Scare of the early 1950s. Once again Richard Widmark plays a charismatic cad--but this time a redeemable one; he's pickpocket Skip McCoy, who grabs a package out of Candy's (Jean Peters) purse on the subway. What Skip doesn't know--and neither does Candy--is that the package contains microfilm that bears a top-secret formula the Soviets want. Joey (Richard Kiley), Candy's sinister boyfriend, has been using the unwitting Candy as a courier to steal U.S. secrets and hand them over to the Reds.		The story takes improbable but riveting twists and turns; Skip tries to pressure the Commies into a big payoff, while he and Candy, improbably but entertainingly, fall in love. Meanwhile, the evil Joey is out gunning for Skip and anyone else who gets in his way.		Fuller keeps the tension up at near-hysterical levels, and at the same time creates a fascinating, Dickensian underworld in 1950s New York. Just because someone beats you up or rats you out in that world doesn't mean he or she doesn't love you. The brilliant performances help a great deal; best of all is Thelma Ritter, in what may be her all-time best performance as Moe, a sad, worn-out snitch whose only remaining ambition is to buy herself a grave. (As for Jean Peters, who could believe that only two years later she would play the serene, virtuous Catherine Marshall in "A Man Called Peter"?) "Pickup on South Street" is great, outrageous, compelling fun for anyone interested in film noir.
0,Very good and entertaining movie.  Great assembled cast and fun to watch.  I especially liked the mix of old western firearms that were used and the complexity of some of the characters.  Highly recommened for western buffs like me.
0,Still fun to watch (after previous seasons), sad that this is all there is.
0,Must seea nd then read the blogs to get a fuller picture
0,I did like this movie. The only part that kind of buged me was the ending. I won't give it away but it was kinda dissapointing. The movie is worth seeing.
0,We had seen at the theatre but we really like Denzel Washington so we bought the movie to watch in our home.	There's more bad language in it than we like, but we deal with it to watch this movie.	Recommend to anyone who likes Denzel W.  The only thing:  he's a bad guy and we didn't like that part of it.
0,good
0,Taking issue #50 of "Spider-Man" as its starting point, Peter Parker decides he needs to get a life outside of Spider-Man. Parker discovers that crime never pays for the hero (or at least his overdue rent). Since he doesn't have time to do his college homework, is failing classes and no has relationship with MJ because of his alter-ego, Parker decides to give up the Spidey suit. When his powers begin failing him because of his indecision, it's the final web for Parker. Parker has lousy timing, though, as just as all this is occurring as Doctor Octavius (Alfred Molina in a marevlously nuanced performance)one of Peter's idols goes mad and becomes a supervillain causing havoc. J. K. Simmons is hillarious as J. Jonah Jameson capturing just the right element of tabloid journalism (and the scenes at The Daily Bugle plays like a miniature screwball comedy that could well have been made in the 40's)that drives Jameson to make Spidey a villain. The rest of the cast from Maguire, Dunst, Franco all the way down to Rosemary Harris as Aunt May capture elements of what made the comic characters so compelling.		With a witty script written by Alvin Sargent ("What About Bob?", "Julia", "Straight Time" and "Unfaithful" among many other scripts)and with contributions by other notable writers (Michael Chabon Pultizer Prize author of The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay), "Spider-Man" soars precisely because of the issues that Parker faces. Sam Raimi's sure handed direction and visual effects that rank among the best  (although sometimes the CGI Spider-Man looks exactly like, well, a CGI representation of Spider-Man)keeps "Spidey-2" from being earthbound. "Spider-Man 2" visits familiar territory for super hero films (already visited by "Superman 2")but has enough originality to stamp the story with its own stamp. Is it better than the original? You'll have to decide for yourself as the first film was exceptional but "Spider-Man 2" at least measures up precisely because it's more character driven.		Comparing the different versions of "Spider-Man 2" is a challenge (there's three out there in the US). The best looking of the bunch is the Superbit edition in which all the extras are shaved off with all the extra disc space devoted strictly to the high definition transfer of picture and sound. Not surprisingly, this edition looks and sounds the best with a crisper picture, sharper images and top notch sound that sounds only slighly better than the 2 disc convention set. The catch is that the Superbit Edition has no extras and is a single disc. You'd also have to have a top-of-the-line system to really, really appreciate the differences (although on a big screen TV you'll see some of them readily apparent). If the person you're buying this for is into the best looking and sounding digital audio and video, this is probably the edition to get.		The 2 disc set looks pretty darn good with a high definition transfer that looks and sounds almost as good as the Superbit Edition. We also get "Spider-Facts" which is, essentially, a text only commentary track. While it occasionally has some interesting tidits about the film (and many outside of the film such as tidbits about New York City), it's dispensable. There's also a blooper reel which is amusing included on the first disc as well as previews/trailers for various films.		The second disc (which could easily have been included in a deluxe 3 disc Superbit Edition set for videophiles)includes a stunning 12 part documentary that discusses the production of the movie from pre-production to the premiere. It's exhaustive and fascinating to watch all on its own as a documentary. "Ock-Umentary: Eight Arms to Hold You" (a rather witty reference to The Beatles' film "Help!") is also a very good documentary on the history of Doc Ock from his first appearence in Spider-Man # 3 to the 60's cartoons to how they adapted the character for the film. There's also a number of very good featurettes including a discussion of the women in Spidey's life (which is only appropriate as two women dominate his life and influence most of his personal decisions),"Enter the Web" uses multi-angle technology to give a glimpse behind-the-scenes of the shooting of the climax of the movie. There's also an art gallery of Alex Ross' paintings from the title sequence (which is used as a brilliant device to sum up the first film for viewers who missed it and reminding everyone of what happened). We don't get any worthwhile games (that's a definite negative for gamers who want to try "Spider-Man 2: The Game") but get a featurette on the making of the game. There's also the usual weblinks. Oh and if you click on one of Doc Ock's tentacles you'll find an Easter Egg showing a very funny practical joke director Sam Raimi played on actor Alfred Molina.		The commentary tracks feature director Raimi, Maguire and the producers and there's also a separate Technical Commentary featuring effects supervisor John Dykstra and others discussing how they achieved the look of the film. For those folks who purchased this at Best-Buy early enough got an extra disc that had the VH-1 Special on the production of the movie. It's OK and more promo piece fluff than behind-the-scenes documentary.		The boxed comes with the conventional two disc set (without the Best Buy disc which is a bit curious as it would have been a nice addition) plus a comic collector's dream team of 25 artists with paintings inspired by the film. There's a portfolio that allows you to view various scenes from conception to final product (which would have been put to better use on a multi-angle DVD for videophiles). Taking an idea from the re-release of "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" (a Raimi favorite), there's five postcard sized reproductions of the artwork used to publicize the film including the trio of promo posters that were plastered all over cities. Finally, there's a reproduction (reduced to fit in the set)of The Amazing Spider-Man # 50 issue that inspired much of the story. They probably also should have included The Amazing Spider-Man #3 where Doc Ock first appeared as well, but that's a pretty minor point.		All in all,the last set makes the better Christmas or birthday gift for fans. Regardless, the film is the same just differing in presentation. "Spider-Man 2" has a number of detractors that don't care for it. They probably shouldn't buy the film or rent it. For the rest of us who liked it, this is an intelligent, fun film thats only major flaws is that it runs about 15 minutes too long.
0,I love this DVD. Scott, the instructor,  explains all the steps, then you participate with him to the music. He is on the beach so you have the water there and the music  both are calming while doing the exercises. I liked this so much I bought one for my sister. She goes to a Tai Chi class but says Scott explains the moves better.
0,Love this movie
0,Great!!!
0,Ive owned this set for several years now and still enjoy watching it now and then. I didn't grow up with Paar, but came to appreciate him years later thanks to his appearances on Johnny Carson & Late Night With David Letterman. What a true talent Jack Paar was! I have no complaints with the set generally  the video quality could have been a bit better, perhaps, but considering this material is in some cases 50+ years old I think were lucky to have it at all! Whatever shape the source material is in, it certainly provides a pretty clear window onto a time that is now, sadly, long gone. Id thoroughly enjoy seeing more!
0,Consistently good.
0,love it
0,This was a gift for my grand daughter she loved it. Anne of Green Gables is one of her favorite movies.
0,Beautiful Movie The Hobbit,Great Peter Jackson. Thank You Amazon as always you are the best
0,I love these stories but the reason that I purchased this version is for the extra vignettes that fill in some of the gaps in the Underworld mythology.		If you love this series as I do, this item is a must.
0,I'm glad this series is available to watch.  Just amazing material, writing, acting and so relevant in a culture that seeks to run from the reality of death.  The juxtaposition of death with the lives of those who help others with the end of life for a loved one is always intriquing.  Once you start watching you can't look away.
0,Okay
0,I love rock and roll and this story about a middle-aged rocker was well done. Humorous, good music and a great story line.
0,So happy to have a new season of Banks
0,In the remarks of the company critic at the top of the page he mentions the plot to be very dated. I say who cares! I saw the movie two weeks ago and remember very little of the plot but the scene of Judy Garland singing "Meet the Beat of My Heart" was seared into my memory. To mangle its lyrics a bit this performance and a hundred others Excited, Delighted and Ignited the thought that this was the greatest song and dance entertainer ever!	"It Never Rains But It Pours" is also really good. "In Between," "Awful In Between" or whatever that song is called reflects somewhat on her own personal and professional quandaries close to the time of its performance.	If you think 10 minutes of music is worth the purchase price buy the DVD. If not do not.
0,Perfect!
0,Sean Connery is at his best since he first played Bond. He is having a blast. It is evident that everyone else is having fun too. This is the perfect apology for the major short comings that "Temple of Doom" had. Must for the collection of film lovers
0,This guy is one very funny pianist!  I laugh over and over again when viewing this or his other DVD's.  He had a real talent for facial expressions combined with his music abilities.  I would recommend this to anyone of any age.
0,I am not a football fan however I did find this film entertaining. As you'll read here this film draws mixed emotions from many here who have seen it. Being an Oliver Stone production I guess other felt this film should have had more depth due to him being the Director however my opinion was that maybe Stone for once didn't want to push the whole "message" thing he normally does and instead focused more on entertainment with the flamboyant actors who did fit with what I believe this film tried to project.		On the negative side however I wish they did add to the backstory of Cameron Diaz' character as I feel her role left questions unanswered and more about her character was needed to make sense of her actions. If you pay attention to the subtle background conversations and chatter you'll discover Cameron's character was making some bad calls like losing 3 draft picks for unknown reasons and her secret deal to move the franchise as well as the financial issues of needing a new stadium. Had these things been more thoroughly explained, Cameron Diaz would not have been outshined by LL and LT as an actor as she was in this film. LT for example had a simpler role in this film but outshined Cameron Diaz solely because his character fit him better.		Overall this was a very entertaining film and could be enjoyed provided you accept these weaknesses in the plot and instead enjoy the film for what I believe it's intention was; to be a fast paced action movie with subtle life lessons mixed in. Also, I wouldn't suggest this film for young children as some of the adult content may be disturbing. If not taken seriously, it's a fun film.
0,I enjoyed nearly all of the seasons of Law & Order, although Angie Harmon was one of my favorite actresses on the series. Also, the character of Lennie Briscoe was always interesting, as were most of the other characters. Although I preferred Michael Moriarty to Sam Watterson, the latter was competent in his role. It was nice when a conservative view was aired which was part of the appeal of the show, as the characters discussed different sides of the issues presented in the show. Angie Harmon took that view during the Tenth season, besides being one of the most beautiful woman on the series. I follow her now on Rizzoli & Isles. When she left they placed the conservative view with Fred Dalton Thompson, but it was nice to see a woman espouse the conservative view.
0,Blade Runner is my all-time favorite movie.  I bought various versions of the film in VHS as they were released, and the original 5-disk set when it came out on DVD.  Now, at a great price, I have the 5-disk Blu-ray set and am delighted with the improved definition.
0,looking forward to watching it,not had time yet
0,I am have now seen this movie twice. The 1st time at the show. I enjoyed it as much the 2nd time as the 1st. Very well done!!!
0,I watched this for the first time at the age of 38. Of course I'd heard about it my whole life but just never watched it. It was surprisingly good (previews looked campy and sappy.) I found it surprisingly romantic, upsetting and with action.
0,I'm addicted...even though there really is more violence and such than I like...can't get myself to stop watching this series...characters are what make it for me...
0,great acting
0,very good movie plays well, disk was in good condition
0,I have followed the UFO subject since the mid Seventies, and as you look back over the decades there are times in that story line where there were clear milestones, seminal events - that either changed or created awareness about UFO's. I think that years from now folks will look back and see this video as an important event in the history of UFOlogy. I say that for a couple of reasons, first, interest in UFO's was at a fairly low ebb at the time. After the buzz created by some of the abductee stuff of the early 90's and the Phoenix Lights in the late 90's there really wasn't much - in the public domain/consciousness, as it were. This video helped spike public interest again and spawned a lot of spin off programming for the next several years based on its success. Secondly, it pulled together in one place several of the best and most interesting cases, so that when viewed one was hit with a wall - a body of evidence that was extremely compelling. Most UFO programs in the past were rather disjointed, incomplete or spent a vast amount of time speculating or providing air time to the standard debunkers for "balance". This video focused on presenting its "case" in court. And it worked. Divide and conquer is one of the most successful strategies - and it has always been used to squash the case for the reality of UFO's. It is easy to dismiss a case here or a case there. And for the public in general - that may not have an interest or are predisposed not to believe - any individual case is easy to ignore or shoot down, but when they are presented as a whole and with the most credible witnesses then it becomes much harder to reject. James Fox did that with this video. The other thing that is important about this video - is that it is not a "professional" production. That is not a slam against James Fox. That is just the truth. There is no "money" behind this production. I know, I work in the business, and I know what I am looking at. And what I see is one very passionate and dedicated young man with a cheap video camera driven to tell this story - and as a result this individual has made the single most compelling argument for the reality of UFO's. He has earned a place among the giants of the field. His contribution is that important and shows the power and impact that one man can have - if focused, passionate and driven. Be sure to see his follow up to this program - "I Know What I Saw".
0,I don't believe that Ed Wood deserves to be called the worst directer is history. He certainly made so bad their good films. But,I believe he just didn't have the money to make grade A films. He took what he could get his hands on and made movies. Simple as that. Some are bad and some or the weirdest things you will ever watch. I put Glen or Glenda in this category.		This is a great place to start with your Ed Wood collection. This collection includes his most famous bad movie, "Plan 9 From Outer Space". Bela Lugosi is in 3 of the films in this set. Some say Ed Wood used Lugosi but i think they had a real friendship. I think they worst movie on this set is "Night of the Ghouls".		The picture quality of these films are top notch. All the films are in Dolby Digital Mono. Although, The Haunted World of Ed Wood is presented in 2.0 Stereo.		Anyway, if you ever wondering where to start with Ed Wood then buy this. You will not be disappointing.		Great set. Especially for B movie lovers.
0,I could literally go on for hours and hours (or pages and pages) about how simply wonderful the original Muppet Movie is. Dialogue from this film has seeped its way into my wife's and my daily conversations. When giving directions the term "Bear Right" is always immediately followed by "Right Frog.". When trying to get the other to lend a hand a monotone "Help. Help. This is a serious cry for help" will get the other up and to their side faster than anything else. Princess Bride is the only flick that has permeated itself more into our wedded subconscious.	The songs are immensely humable. The soundtrack has existed in our home on vinyl, cassette tape and is now sitting in our CD Jukebox in constant rotation. Movin' Right Along is the first thing to escape our lips on long car trips and I Hope That Something Better Comes Along was played at our wedding.	I won't even go into the cameos because they are a cacography of the time the film was made. Everyone wanted to be seen with the Muppets.	This is one of my favorite films of all times. That's what makes this review so hard to write.	These chunks of emotion and inspiration wrapped up in felt and fur deserve better than this. The bonus features on all the recently released disks are sparse at best. All come with "Muppetisms", very short commercials that I assume ran on TV at some point. They are at most 30 seconds long and, while amusing, really only whet the appetite.	The Muppets Take Manhattan comes with an interview done with Jim Henson, but it is spliced and diced up so that between each question the viewer is returned to a menu and forced to prompt the disk to play the next segment. At the minimum a Play All option should have been added.	There are literally tons of additional supplements that could have been added. Skits done on Saturday Night Live, Rowlf's appearances on the Jimmy Dean Variety show and Kermit hosting the Tonight Show would have been great. A feature length commentary with Frank Oz would have gotten me to turn handsprings. Toss in a DVD Muppet encyclopedia or a copy of the PC game that came out a few years ago and my head would have just exploded with a burst of confetti!	I can't not recommend this movie just because of the lack of supplements, but I don't have to be happy about it either.	I am sure that somewhere down the line there will be super-duper, ultra-collectors versions of these films and I can't wait for that day to come. Princess Bride was originally released in a similar version with no supplements and I was just happy to get it on disk and in Widescreen. There is now a two-disk collectors edition in the works coming out in September of this year. (2001). I guess they just saw me coming.
0,Most people don't like this movie for it's bad acting, lack of special effects, we never see the "witch," and other things.  But you have to understand that they were trying to make it look realistic.  It  wasn't scary, but it was fun to watch.  I had a couple of problems: (1)We  didn't see a witch.  Not even a glimpse of a foot or anything (2)The town  they lived in was never known as Blair (3)At first, it made me a little  upset that the creators tried to make us think it's real.  But now I see  the beauty of it.  This got such bad reviews from people because they don't  fully understand it.  Whether you like this movie or not, you have to  respect the creators for trying something new and unique.  I'm tempted to  get a copy of the DVD.  I don't think it's a very good idea to make a  sequel and a prequel.	I can't wait for Fox to start showing Fearsum!
0,Wonderful. Makes me think things are not any different back then as today.
0,Been waiting to start watching this series.  Finally was able to get some spare time to start Season 1.  Great show!
0,I really enjoyed this movie. It had a great cast and a rather interesting and satisfying twist to the ending, which I thought was perfect.		The scenes on the Orient Express in particular are so beautiful. They brought to mind a time not so long ago, when train travel was the height of elegance and style. Nice to see that some of that is still available now, if money is abundant! ;>) Makes me want to take a trip on this famous train too.		A great way to while away an evening.		I haven't seen the original version but now I plan to check that one out too.

0,CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER is probably, next to THE DARK KNIGHT and SPIDER-MAN, one of the best super-hero movies out there. One of the best things of the film is that it is a World War II movie and a super-hero movie all rolled into one. Faithful to the character's comic-book origin and with overtones of patriotism and good 'ol fashioned American values, the movie is somewhat of a throwback to old time movie-making story-telling. MARVEL studios went all out to make the tone just right and the production values top-notch with excellent casting. From Tommy Lee Jones in a great support roll as Col. Chester Phillips, Hugo Weaving as the Red Skull/Johann Schmidt, the Howard Hughes composit Howard Stark (father to Tony Stark aka IRON MAN)played by Dominic Cooper, Chris Evans is excellent in the title role, and finally Stanley Tucci is perfectly cast as Dr. Abraham Erskine (the kindly scientist who sees the good in Steve Rogers to make him the candidate to use his scientific research and create Captain America)... The film delivers on all parts of the super-hero film genre. A definite must-see film.

0,It is a very intriguing movie and Matthew does an outstanding job as always!!  Would recommend to everyone.
0,I rented this film solely on a chance and found myself really, really suprised at just how well done it was.	Since, as of this writing, there is no plot synopsis here, I will include a brief one. A travelling sideshow, run by Tim Curry, pulls into a small town. It's star attraction is a young girl born covered in hair and billed as The Wolfgirl. She encounters taunts and threats from a group of young townie teenagers, as well as the posibility for a cure for her malady from the local misfit. The cure seems to work, but with the side effect that the previously gentle girl begins to experience more animalistic urges even as she physically becomes more "human".	This film seems to have come out of nowhere. It actually saw life on the USA Network as "Wolfgirl". I hadn't heard of it under either title. Neither name is particularly good, but hey, it's nit picking. The film far outshines such a stuff for a number of reasons.	The cast: Tim Curry is a perfect choice for Harley. He balances a desire for the financial survival of his show with a paternal love and respect for his performers. His is a colorful, yet flawed character, one whom you can easily both like and be angry with, and he makes it very believable. Grace Jones shows far more range than usual and makes great use of her androgeny in playing a half man/half woman. Darlene Cates, the mother from "Gilbert Grape" again amazes as Athena The Fat Lady. One wishes she could grace the screen more often. And Victoria Sanchez, as Tara The Wolfgirl, manages to truly seem beautiful beneath a full hairy make-up job. She is really phenomenal in a brave role for such a lovely looking young lady.	The rest of the cast is equally talented, and I would speak more of them, but for the desire to compliment some very special members. The performers of the freak show are anything but freaks. With the exception of Sanchez and Jones, almost every other sideshow performer is the real deal, and they shine. We are given a chance to see these people in everyday mode, not just as part of the show. The family they portray is believable and breathtaking. Never are they shown in anything but the most repectful light and when they get individual chances to act within character, they are, to a one, believable. Of particular note is Jordan Prentice as Finger Finnian, Harley's right hand man. Not a single false note whenever he is on screen.	The production: What an amazing-looking film! Marvelous production design gives the sideshow scenes an almost other-worldly quality. That the film was shot in Romania only adds to this old world feel within contemporary society. And Paul Jones' JoJo the Dog-Faced Boy make up design for Sanchez as the Wolfgirl is completely convincing. Really. Thom Fitzgerald's direction is biased towards the actors, as it should be here, but he also keeps the pace going and the details clear.	The songs: The sideshow performances themselves are often in musical form with some delightfully bawdy and clever tunes by John Roby. It really gives the film a special touch. It's also great to hear Curry get to sing with the broadness that we remember from Rocky Horror. If there is a CD out there with these songs, I want it! There is also a great Ani DiFranco tune ofver the end credits.	So, why does this film only get four stars after all this laudatory talk? The screenplay, while hitting the mark on the human end of things, seems to go slightly awry when it comes to the horror end of things. When there is violence or the like, it seems somwhat out of place, as if there was a story to tell, but that it was felt that it would only be marketable as a horror flick. It's too bad, because the emotional root is so strong (with the added idea that the "freaks", who are so obviously different, are not the ones with something to be ashamed of). Also, where are the police in this town? With all the delinquint juvvie activity, fearsome wolf attacks, etc., there's nary a cop in sight! Still, I would not hesitate to recommend this film. The four stars is relative to all other films, but that lack of a fifth should not be counted against it.	One final note: This film was suprising in how little it held back in a number of areas, particularly nudity, which is sometimes used for a truly appropriate "shock". I didn't have a problem with it, but it was so unexpected (and I'm not spoiling anything here) and unique that I was a bit taken aback. It's not what we're used to seeing in any mainstream film and some more prickly folk should be made aware.	With "Ginger Snaps" a short while ago, the fem-Werewolf themed film is having a suprising little uprising of quality cinema!
0,I let someone borrow this and they never gave it back. So I bought a new one. The movie is one of my favorites. I am actually thinking about upgrading to blu-ray.
0,This is an outstanding show that really holds up over time.  These Blu Rays show the show in a crisp picture and great sound.
0,it has been awhile since i watched this movie but overall i recall it being a pretty good and the price was better than other sites.
0,To me there is nothing as wonderful as an old Hammer Classic Horror Movie.... They might not have the special affects the new horror movies offer but they are still entertaining with beautiful sets and scary plots.  The British know how to make good horror movies...love anything British, especially British actors Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee..
0,Everything and quality perfect of dark shadows 25. Just as crystal clear as if it was still 1971. Thanks for makeing it able to have in my collections---- L. Monti
0,Having just finished Life On Mars seasons one and two. I had to take the plunge. Not cheap, the set depicts a fast moving rather gritty british alternative to Kojak, McCloud, Columbo, ect. The Sweeney served as the inspiration for Life On Mars.	Fast moving ( for it's time ) you'll enjoy the car chases, roughing up of the bad guys, ect. Each show is fully independent	of the next. Some of the endings however; aren't quite the " happy endings " we've grown to expect. Lots of humor and british	slang circa 1970's. Though remastered, isn't quite up to the picture quality of the more modern shows. If you haven't seen Life On Mars you'll want to. Purchase the BRITISH release.
0,Either you like the series or you don't
0,This is simply a marvelous movie.  A rich story enveloped by wonderful cinematography.  I liked this so very much that I will find a copy of Mary Poppins to watch again.
0,Is better in Blue Ray. I replaced my older DVD version
0,If you want adventurous and humorous fun in your movies, these two are your cup of tea.  With a little bit of real history thrown in, both films move	at lightning speed, leaving little time to suspend any disbelief you might have.	To be honest, I slightly prefer Book of Secrets because of the presense of the wonderful Helen Mirren, reportedly to have had the time of her life making the film and it shows.	Advice: Watch them in order.	BTW/ the Blu-Ray transfers are wonderful.

0,A pleasant surprise.
0,We are working our way through the series with our boys and enjoyed this episode just as much as all the others!
0,Good
0,Very ornate and satisfying. Complex and socially conscious.
0,I'm such a fan of milla and I'm so happy to add this movie to my collection again. I originally had this movie from when it first came out but it happened to be one of the handful of dvd's that got broken when I moved a couple years ago. Finally replacing it. And I'm gonna watch it now!
0,Recently, saw this movie on the TV.  I thought the kids would like it!
0,Best street cop drama ever done....highly recommended to all....unfortunately not enough people knew about it to keep it going....very disappointed that all the cliff hangers were left...some rumors of a movie to wrap it up for fans.
0,This is a very sweet and funny movie!  It's also completely improvised - and includes a cast primarily made up of children!  Superbly cast (David Tennant is always incredible, regardless of what he does), this is a very enjoyable film to watch any time of the year!
0,ok

0,I enjoy movies with Teri Polo in them. I have approximately four, I loved her in Straight from the Heart.
0,Very nice 5 Stars
0,You have to stick with it to finally get the feeling you know what's going on, but was worth it.
0,An utterly sweet, inventive and charming film that examines our love	affair with the movies and our need to escape into fantasy. The central	device of the wall breaking down between the characters in a film and	those watching is great fun, and both Mia Farrow and Jeff Daniels do	some of their very best work in this.		That said, for me, it lacks a little of the depth and complexity of my	very favorite Allen films. It's a little too cute and simplistic	in the middle, although the first and last third, and the uncompromised	ending are terrific. It doesn't quite hold up on multiple viewings	the way 'Annie Hall', or 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' or 'Hannah and Her	Sisters' or 'Zelig' do. But even 2nd tier Woody Allen is better than	almost anything else out there. And on a certain level, with great	filmmakers its about personal taste, not right and wrong. (e.g. Is Chapln's	'Modern Times' better than 'City Lights' ?) So, if you like Allen's	work at all and you've never seen this, you owe yourself a look to	decide for yourself.
0,I remember the first time I watched "Cowboy Bebop" like it was yesterday. It was a cold Saturday night in September 2002 and I was eager to watch something fresh. This was during a time when Cartoon Network still hadn't reached a creative decline and didn't have ridiculous live-action shows cluttering the network like infested roaches. As I browse through the TV menu to see what I could watch on the channel, I accidentally highlighted "Cowboy Bebop" for Saturday night. I never heard of "Bebop" before, but what struck me about this show was that it was rated TV-14. Now back in those days, the highest rating of a show on Cartoon Network was TV-PG, so imagine my surprise when I found out that a Cartoon Network show that was for older audiences. Imagine my bigger surprise when this was an anime, which I never cared for at the time. But the biggest surprise was just how damn good this show was. Hell, it wasn't good. It was fantastic. Even though it was the final episode of "Bebop", I was immediately drawn into the show: it had interesting characters, marvelous art direction, exciting action scenes and...an ending that moved me to tears?!! No wonder this was TV-14; this show was created for the audiences' best interest, an interest that doesn't involve bulky robots, talking mice or space warriors spending three hours talking and three seconds fighting.		Much like how words cannot describe my love for "Cowboy Bebop", no review, no matter how long and deep, can entirely express the timelessness of that show. But I'll do the best I can. There may be greater Japanese cartoons. Cartoons of greater vision, emotional complexity and political importance. Cartoons that have significantly altered the course of an industry (ex: "Evangelion"). And even cartoons that we would put above it on our lists. But no Japanese cartoon is more loved and has greater appeal than "Cowboy Bebop". This is an anime that transcended categories and genre conventions. It has appeared on more "greatest anime" lists than any Japanese cartoon, even "Evangelion" and the Miyazaki films. It has outlived many of the climatic changes in the anime industry, including the poisonous moe phenomenon and even the closure of its distributor Bandai Entertainment. And whereas most anime of the 1990s have become interesting relics and forgotten, "Bebop" keeps growing and gaining more fans. And now with Funimation finally releasing this show on Blu-Ray this December, the popularity of "Bebop" will continue to endure. "Cowboy Bebop" isn't just an anime; it's THE anime.		What is it about "Cowboy Bebop" that makes it an enduring classic? What exactly makes this 15-year old Japanese cartoon so appealing that it outranks far more popular cartoons like "Evangelion", "Naruto" and "Fullmetal Alchemist"? For starters,  It's got great action, terrific comedy, a splendid blend of film noir, science-fiction and crime drama, dramatic moments that will move you to tears and a wonderful sense of pacing. It paints a marvelously convincing portrait of a universe smeared with corruption and on the verge of anarchy, a universe that may be set in the future but feels exactly like now. And lastly, it boasts one of the greatest soundtracks of all time, courtesy of the irreplaceable Yoko Kanno. In short, "Cowboy Bebop" is a show that has something for everyone and things that people don't like wind up enjoying anyway.		But most of all, "Cowboy Bebop" has got great characters that we identify with, characters that we love so much that we empathize their plights and even dread when their lives are threatened. There's Spike Spiegel, an expert gunman and martial artist whose seemingly laid-back attitude conceals his longing for a woman he loved and lost. There's Jet Black, a former ISSP police officer who has grown disillusioned with the world he used to serve. And last but not least, there's Faye Valentine, a gambling addict suffocating under a mountain of debt while also hiding a painful secret that has left her alienated and rejecting solitude. Adding to this cast of wounded souls are genius hacker Radical Edward and the data dog Ein, who is not your average Welsh Corgi.		"Cowboy Bebop" is about four bounty hunters who struggle to live in a universe while being haunted by their turbulent pasts. This is immensely appealing. Whereas in a typical sci-fi anime, a protagonist would seek a reward that would make them prosperously rich and escape somewhere at the far reaches of space, the "Bebop" try to make ends meet, hunting their targets to sustain themselves and coming in terms with their personal demons. Their top priority isn't wealth or even escape, but survival. If that isn't universal, then nothing is.		The beauty of watching "Cowboy Bebop" is seeing the characters grow and realize where their place in the universe is. At first, they seem like a squabbling family whose presence irks one another. The interplay between these four is touching, even hilarious; they could be four people at work, except their work is to hunt criminals. But by the end of the series, the characters (as well as us) mourn their hasty disbandment, as one returns to her home planet to find what she lost and the other goes back to confront HIS past, one that will never stop until either it or he is destroyed. It's melancholic without being overly depressing, but as they always say, every beginning as its end.		Watching "Cowboy Bebop" today, I'm amazed at how fresh it is. Seeing the whole 26-episode series is like getting acquainted with an old friend and remembering the fun moments we spent together. Anyone who saw "Cowboy Bebop" the first time will never forget the spectacular space battles ("Wild Horses", "Gateway Shuffle"), the intense action (the church shootout in "Ballad of Fallen Angels", the alley brawl in "Jupiter Jazz Pt. I", Spike's riveting battle with a psychotic madman in "Pierrot le Fou" and the climatic sequence in "The Real Folk Blues Pt. II", and more), hilarious comedy ("Mushroom Samba", "Cowboy Funk") and genuine moments of pathos ("Waltz for Venus", "Hard Luck Woman"). They certainly won't forget the wonderful dialogue ("In order to receive, you have to give". "There are three things I particularly hate: kids, animals and women with attitude". "How long you've been listening?"/"Too long. Your story needs editing". "If you see a stranger, follow him". "Man, I hate theme parks." "It's all a dream?". "Easy come, easy go." "I'm going out there to find out if I'm really alive", just to name a few), which now feels welcoming at a time when most Japanese cartoons feature uninspired one-liners and boring exposition.		And the music! Oh, how I love the music. For many viewers, including myself, my introduction towards jazz, blues, country, ambient music, salsa, funk, classical music and even 60s-70s rock n' roll came not from a radio station but from this very show. I would never have gotten into the likes of Miles Davis, Waylon Jennings, Moby, Funkadelic and Massive Attack if I didn't hear "Piano Black", "Forever Broke", "Cats on Mars", "Ave Maria", "Mushroom Hunting" and "Spokey Dokey". But praising the soundtrack because of its diversity is damning it with faint praise. Yoko Kanno and the Seatbelts' music represent the heart and soul of the show, capturing the mood, atmosphere and emotional power of what happens on screen. Fewer songs are charmingly hilarious as "Want It Back" and the Morricone-influenced "Go Go Cactus Man". Few anime song get you emotionally riled up like the thunderous "Rain" and the potent "Space Lion". And if you don't weep when listening to "Call Me, Call Me", "Blue" and the electrifying "Real Folk Blues" after watching this show, then there's something wrong with you.		And last but not least, let's talk about the English dub. My God, is it amazing? Most English dubs are either charmingly cheesy or feel like a pale imitation of the original Japanese version, but Bebop's English voice acting sounds just as good today as it did back in 1999. When released in America, Japanese cartoons either lived or died by the dubbing and "Cowboy Bebop"'s English voice acting is so superlative, so emotionally resonant that even the show's creator feels it surpasses the original. Not a bad compliment, considering that the Japanese version featured the likes of Koichi Yamadera, Megumi Hayashibara and Unsho Ishizuka.		"Cowboy Bebop" is on more of everyone's favorite anime lists than any Japanese cartoon in existence and for good reason; it is an anime that even people who hate anime love. Seeing the anime again and again, it never feels over-familiar, only fresher and more relevant. Funimation has truly hit a home run in snatching "Bebop" and preparing its Blu-Ray release in mid-December. And seriously, what better Christmas gift to give to a new generation of fans than the Blu-Ray box set of "Cowboy Bebop"? It is one of animation's greatest treasures, and like all great treasures, it will continue to endure while many of its contemporaries have been long forgotten and buried.		"Love never dies"/"Love never fails"/"Love never ever fades away"		And neither will this series.
0,I could NEVER get tired of watching "Buffy." This is one of my all time favorite shows EVER. The witty jabs SMG throws at the vampires are just as deadly as her weapons. The action scenes were great, but it did become a favorite pass time of mine to try to spot the stunt doubles (which was pretty easy to do).		This is one series that has aged well. It was great the first time I watched it on tv and still just as great when I watched it for the umpteenth time recently on Amazon.
0,I'm so happy these movies are finally available on DVD!		Having Wonderful Crime is a wonderful screwball comedy from 1945. It stars the beautiful actress Carole Landis in one of her best performances. She plays a ditzy newlywed who gets caught up trying to solve a crime on her honeymoon. There are lots of laughs and the entire cast is superb - Pat O'Brien, George Murphy, and Chili Williams (known as the polka-dot girl). If you're a Carole Landis fan you will love Having Wonderful Crime.		Mrs. O'Malley and Mr. Malone is a fun little film too with a completely different cast :-) Marjorie Main gives a great performance :-)

0,This was a really good movie depiction of the life of Genghis Khan. The story starts with him as a little boy and goes on to tell the story of how he became the leader of his group of Mongols and why he was so hardened by the things he suffered through in his lifetime.
0,How impressive some people are - they stand up for justice and humanity - without thinking about their own comfort. I am full of admiration for Janet "Prissy" Gregory, who fought so hard and in the end succeeded to get Calvin Willis out of jail.		This film is based on the true story of Calvin Willis wrongfully accused of raping a neighborhood girl. When Janet Gregory starts digging into his story, she gets convinced of his innocence. Willis served 22 years in prison due to miscarriage of justice and the film shows the struggle to free him and clear him from the indictment.		They are both heroes as well as Willis' grandmother that stood by his side all these long difficult years. Unjust can be righted, even though he will never get back the years he lost. Never give up, keep your hopes and fight the unjust in the legal system.
0,I love this series.  I felt it would be a good add to my movie library.
0,Mallrats- If you liked Clerks, get it. If you liked Chasing Amy, get it. If you like witty humor and tons of sarcasm, get it.	I don't understand people who claim this film is not as good as some of Kev Smith's other flicks.  It has much better acting than Clerks and is tremendously more humorous than Chasing Amy.  I could ramble for hours about what makes this View Askew piece as rewarding as any of the others, but I won't.  I will simply give you one reason to get this film....  Jason Lee.	Jason Lee (Almost Famous, Chasing Amy) blows away everyone in this flick (except Jay and his hetero life mate, Silent Bob, nootch.)  Watching this movie, you get the sense that Lee's character was expanded simply because of the authenticity that Lee oozes.  This was Jason Lee's first large role and he ran with the opportunity.  Brodie (Lee) is that guy that all of you know.  Half disgusting, half hilarious, and faster than Walt Flanigan's dog.  Treat yourself, get it.
0,Fabulous early career concert, nothing to dislike here. However, the plexiglass drum shield(hate it)keeps his excellent drummer clearly way to low in the mix.	Great audience shots of Yanni's mom, & Linda Evans.	Stands up to the test of time. Great video & audio!
0,James Caan was in some of the hardest hitting films by some of the hardest hitting directors of the seventies and early eighties including Coppola's Godfather I(72), Sam Peckinpah's The Killer Elite (75)and Michael Mann's Thief (81). He also played a number of athlete roles, including Rollerball(75). Whether he's playing an athlete or not Caan moves like an athlete, and he gets jumpy if he has to sit still for too long, and so he's interesting to watch even when he's just crossing the street because its like he's always on the scent of something, always on the prowl.		In the opening scenes of Gambler (74) Caan is playing the tables in an all-night casino and losing one hand after another. By morning, as he's driving home, he realizes he has lost 44,000 dollars. But the jumpy Caan still hasn't been satisfied and when he sees some teens playing basketball he stops his car and hustles up a game. They only have ten bucks but thats enough. It's the thrill of the game and the thrill of the bet that turns him on and he really comes to life on the courts.		His real job we soon find out is pretty high class. He's a college English professor who lectures on Dostoyevsky and the failed/corrupted/compromised American dream (good solid early 70's staple topic that last one). And he does it really well. He's certainly not your usual professor because its obvious just by looking at him and listening to him that he's more physycal than mental and he's actually interested in the thrill of living life and not the agony of writing books about it. Caan's "Axel Freed" is a guy who has seen a lot and done a lot and his students appreciate that he's not a guy who spends his afternoons in the library. But where he does spend his afternoons and evenings is getting him in deep trouble.		The gambling problem seems to stem from the fact that he's never really escaped from the safe confines and purse strings of his social class and this embarrases him and makes him feel inauthentic and unmanly. Its like he was born to a reality or class that never fit, and he's been trying to return to his rightful home (the streets, the basketball courts, the tennis courts, the boxing ring) ever since. Money has always stood between Axel Freed and the life he imagines tobe his own. Even when at home with his lady he can't stand still; he's perpetually shadow boxing in the mirror and perusing the sports page and ringin' up his bookie. Day to day, moment to moment, he lives for the thrill of those last seconds of a game when his whole life depends on whether the basketball will or will not go in. Watching him take incredible risks is painful because we fear where it will all lead, but its also exhilerating.		Caan is tough in The Gambler, no doubt, but the role of Axel Freed allows him to stretch and show that he can play not only a physical guy but a physical guy with a lot going on in his head. Its a pleasure to see James Caan sitting in front of an English class lecturing to a group of attentive students about why man does not always follow the dictates of reason. "Reason," Axel reads from his copy of Dostoyevsky, "satisfies our rational requirements, but desire encompasses everything." What makes this especially interesting is that we know Axel Freed isn't just some egghead with a set of theories but that he's taking his lessons from real life.		Axel seems to have a great job and a great sexy girlfriend (Lauren Hutton) but its just not enough to keep his attention; he needs that extra adrenalin rush that only extreme situations that sports and gambling and pushin' the bounds of reason can provide.		The film reminds me of Rafelson's Five Easy Pieces but its much grittier and the ending is so unexpected and raw that many may be turned off by it but it has the advantage of giving you a final glimpse of this character that you are not likely to forget.		Unexpected ending but hits right where it should.		If you wanted to you could probably analyze this film from a number of angles. One being that modern man just isn't satisfied living in his settled society doing mundane tasks but then that might sound too academic and too trite and thats just what Axel's trying to escape from.		O yes the film is like a yearbook of seventies actors as there are about fifteen recognizable faces in supporting roles: including Lauren Hutton as girlfriend, Paul Sorvino as bookie, Huggie Bear as a pimp, and James Woods as a snotty bank clerk who Caan has to rough up.		Karel Reisz was himself a Jewish refugee from Czechoslovakia. He fled to the UK to escape the Holocaust so the story of Axel Freed's uncle is especially interesting in that light. Reisz also directed another tremendous seventies film called Who'll Stop the Rain (1978) based on Robert Stone's Dog Soldiers and starring Nick Nolte and Tuesday Weld.
0,Innovative re-telling of a classic legend. enjoying the leads sexual tensions.
0,It has always irritated me to no visible end that people, to this day, blame Ms. Riefenstahl for Nazism.  It shows how people can be so narrow minded as to lay the blame of a horrifying political movement at the feet of an artist.  Richard Wagner also gets blamed for Nazism as well, but that's another review.  Leni is one of the few female film directors who has a great visual style (which is used to great effect, and horrifying effect, in Triumph of the Will).  Her film Olympia is still amongst the greatest sports documentaries ever made.  The techinques she uses are still used by TV sports directors today.  In this film, we see a 90 year old Leni Riefenstahl, who is as tenancious, vivacious, and as combative as ever.  Leni is the most beautiful 90 year old woman I have ever seen, personally.  She talks passionately about her work, and remembers the filming of the 1936 Olymipics and the Nuremberg rally as if it was only yesterday.  I think she is a great artist, and it is ridiculously narrow minded to blame her for the Nazis.  It is always easy to blame an artist for society's ills.  This usually shows the stupidity of politicians more than anything else.  Yes, she was associated with Hitler, one of the world's most heinous dictators, but that shouldn't dismiss her contribution to cinematic art.  At the time of this film, Leni was scuba diving, engaging in underwater photography, and had a male companion/boyfriend a third of her age.  Despite her age, she was incredibly active, and I think that's fantastic.  She is a great artist, period.
0,Exciting adventure, but just wished it covered the whole book instead of stopping midway through.  Luckily part 2 will be in the theaters soon.
0,I Know I was amped up about the release of the new Futurama movies and hopefully the series return, But all you who claim to be fans and down talk these new outings are helping to kill Futuramas return to tv. BBS had the carm of the series same humor and storytelling just in a longer format. I agree the series had better content but i still give both the first two movies 5 stars loved them! Any fan of the show pick them up and show fox that we want more Futurama in prime time Then we can have 23 brand new minutes of futurama every week.	Hypnotoad says "BUY FUTURAMA MOVIES NOW , BUY TWO!"
0,Had this on vhs but wanted it on dvd. Just love it. Surprising ending. Red is off limits to them.
0,Arrived  quickly  and  we'll packaged...love this  movie !  Have  always  liked  Patrick  McGoohan !
0,oh my goodness I love this couldn't wait couldn't resist good price good company
0,The show continues to add to its universe.  The good writing and acting show that the popularity of the program isn't a flash in the pan.
0,Classic Jack Nicholson at his very best. One of the best films ever made - and  the interactions between all of the characters - especially the roles played by Will Sampson and Louise Fletcher are superb. It would be hard to find anyone who would not enjoy this movie
0,I was pleasantly surprised of how well written and directed this movie was. The little girl (Ivana Baquero) does a great job in showing us her "Pure and kind" imaginary world where she is a lost princess trying to find her way back from the human world, set in contrast of the terrible and cruel reality around her taking place during the Spanish civil war. Sergio Lopez also does an splendid job as the villain. In summary this is a movie about the innocence and good of a child's imagination against the evil created by adults in the real world.
0,It's really interesting to see what goes on behind the camera!
0,One of the greatest movies
0,These are great old B & W  deyective movies.  Great acting, superb actors.  Fun to watch.  Amazing good quality of picturr for the age of the fiim.  Mr. Moto are almost as good as the Charlie Chan Movies. Real intertainment without the Blood Violence and Sex.
0,Love this movie I had to replace my dvd"s so I bought the digital versions. it's really nice that Amazon has them all in the extended editions. I bought all three movies.
0,Totally engaging!
0,The quality of this movie is outstanding. Where you really notice the video quality, is when you look at the details, now visable, in the far distance scenery. The sound quality is also very clear. If you are a John Wayne fan, this version is a must have. The quality runs circles around the DVD version.
0,If you like Twilight or anything with glitter, don't watch this movie.  If you truly appreciate a real vampire story, watch this movie.  This is not a horror movie.  This is a thought provoking and emotional movie.  Not for the simple minded.
0,Charlie's Angels meets Barbie! It's a very fun, colorful movie that really does show the true meaning of teamwork and girl power. "Spy Squad" is familiar if you're a fan of the old-school spy shows, and if you've seen movies like "Ultraviolet" with use of "dimension compressing technology", and even Star Wars with the G.L.I.S., a glowing, expandable launching stick that could be summoned back to Barbie, much like the light saber of the Star Wars saga. You'll find easter eggs reminiscent of past Barbie films hidden throughout the movie. I think the film is a great way to encourage girls that they can use their brains and their bodies for much more than just beauty and vanity.
0,It is a series of good light murder mysteries with good cast rapport. It always adds a side family story for each episode and there are continuing themes in the family story. This is the same I wrote for Season 1 because it just gets better with age and familiarity.
0,Some truly exquisite scenery and cinematography here, courtesy of the late great Andrew Lesnie. Russell Crowe makes his directorial debut with this,  and his sure touch and ability to craft a fascinating storyline without resorting to mawkishness and/or preachiness makes this a really wonderful film. I won't give away too much of the plot, other than to say it's set in the aftermath of the disastrous Gallipoli campaign of 1915, but this is not a sweeping war epic. The focus here is on individuals and how they are impacted, in various and sometimes surprising ways, by a horrific event. I eagerly await another movie directed by Crowe!
0,a classic
0,My 10-yr old says give it a 5!  It was a very nice family movie teaching the importance of working through adversity and staying true to your dream.
0,The good guys win!
0,In homage to the late Lavon Helm, tonight I watched the DVD "Ramble at the Ryman." The concert provided one of my "best ever" musical experiences. The horn section is a joy, and every other musician in the project makes a unique contribution. There is good camera work and editing, albeit the sound is a bit sloppy. The creativity, spontaneity, genre diversity, and energy are profound. Best of all, it is obvious that everyone on the stage is loving the sharing of an unforgettable musical production.
0,This is one of the best movies I've ever seen and that can keep my attention throughout its entirety.  I would recommend this for anyone who is into action movies, police/crime movies and, of course, any fans of Batman.  The 3rd one in the trilogy even tops this and I thought that was very hard to do.  It's lengthy, but it's worth it and its entertainment value is very high.
0,Good movie.
0,Awesome movie. Denzel is great
0,I was born in the 70's so the movies would play on the tv, but I had no idea what was going on. It was neat to watch them all in order as an adult to appreciate them. I passed them onto my niece who is in college to watch with her friends.
0,I don't like to give movie reviews.  Movies like books are so subjectivebut this movie was so funny and cheered me up so much  that I must recommend it and give the entire cast a big bravo! Should be one of your must watch movies at Christmas time...
0,At first I was finding it a bit hard to work out exactly what was the deal with the zombies in this one.  They were traditionally walking aimlessly through an airport with dazed looks on their face, grunting to one another like your movie norm zombie, but then R (as he would later become known) could open an airplane door, play old records, and obviously at some stage the zombies have got the generators going and maintained the power to the airport.  Then, well I don't know if I'd say I worked it out but I guess I just accepted whatever goes, goes, forgot to question it any longer in my mind and I ended up really enjoying this film.  It didn't hurt that his human kidnap victim was smoking hot (played by Teresa Palmer).  There are moments watching this where you're thinking, well if they have a BMW and can drive it, why doesn't she just drive it away herself and return to the humans.  Or where would she have got a weedwacker from in an airport terminal?		It's a situation light comedy. R eats the brains of the boyfriend of Julie, a hot girl who is part of a reluctant scavenger group and obtains bits of the boyfriend's memory including his fondness for Julie.  He kidnaps/saves her by rubbing blood over her alive scent and drags her back to the abandoned airport where the zombies reside, and his room (a powered up airliner) on the tarmac.  He wants to feel more human (which is why zombies particularly enjoy eating brains, they feel human from the memories) and to make Julie his girlfriend.  Julie wants to return to the human base, but is beginning to realise that zombies aren't just brain dead human eating machines that her father, the military leader of the compound, has portrayed them as.  Nicholas Hoult plays an interesting high functioning zombie, but it is really his zombie best friend M (played by Rob Corddry who bring the fun vibe to the zombie masses).		This Amazon product page lists the DVD as having no features, but the one I watched had plenty, in fact combined they went for longer than the film.  There's deleted scenes and a gag reel of course but also a lot of features on the behind the scenes stuff in Montreal. Such as casting, playing the zombies, shooting the movie, finding an abandoned airport, interviews with the author of the book, bringing the book to the screen (it's well done enough that I actually want to read the book now).  Theresa Palmer also shot a lot of footage with her own camera while the movie was being made and there's a feature of that footage.  Rob Corddry again steals the scenes in all these behind the scenes features, Teresa Palmer and Nicholas Hoult all seemed to be practical jokers and always having fun the whole time, making this features fun to watch. Interestingly everything was shot trying to push the limits but keep it a PG movie (although here in Australia it is rated M).  If you can a version with these features over a featureless DVD, it's worth the money.		Warm Bodies is a refreshing spin on the same old zombie survival film we've become used to.  It doesn't obey the laws of the zombie universe, but that's why it works!
0,Funny movie!
0,Great movie!
0,It is great news to hear that "The Lone Ranger" seasons one and two shall be released as a properly restored 13 disc set. This is the second of two good pieces of DVD news for me this fall, the first being the release of the 1929-1938 Little Rascals shorts.		There was a time, from my childhood up until the mid-1980's, when shows such as the Lone Ranger and The Little Rascals filled week-day afternoon and Saturday morning TV slots. Old movies could be readily found on TV late at night and on Sunday afternoons. Ever since TV stations began filling every extra additional minute with infomercials and their own first-run productions and reality shows, as well as the beginning of the continuous news cycle, these old classics have not seen the light of day. Even networks supposedly dedicated to classic TV seem to think that "Scrubs" and "The Fresh Prince" constitute classic TV. That's why it's great to have shows such as The Lone Ranger properly restored and available to us again.		I also appreciate that all 78 episodes of the first two seasons are in this set, oddly distributed as 52 weekly episodes in season one and 26 in season two. No stingy "Season 1 Volume 1" sets here, just because there were more episodes per season during the 50's and 60's than exist today. Do note that some of the episodes are very short - in some cases only 11 or 12 minutes long. That is because sometimes the sponsor would put two short serials in the same half hour slot. The time really belonged to the sponsor back in those days, and early TV schedules looked a lot like radio at first.		My favorite episode of the first two seasons was "The Silent Voice" towards the end of season two. The witness to a crime is a stroke victim who is completely paralyzed. The Lone Ranger comes up with a way for the woman to communicate by blinking in response to letters of the alphabet.		The other episode from this early part of the series that sticks out is one in which the wife in a husband/wife crime team betrays the husband and shoots him. He is presumed dead and taken to the undertaker's. The Lone Ranger discovers that the husband is not dead, and the husband makes a confession as to what is going on before he dies as he lies on a slab about to buried - alive. The Lone Ranger tricks the wife by claiming that her husband is still alive. That's what I liked about the Lone Ranger - it really could be very dark. There would always be the happy ending with the criminals rounded up and jailed, but that didn't mean that some good people didn't fall along the way or that something really creepy or cringe-worthy wasn't part of the plot. Highly recommended. The following is the listing of the episodes on each disc:		Disc #1	1. Enter the Lone Ranger [25:42] - (September 15,1949) - Six Texas Rangers, led by Captain Dan Reid, are ambushed in a canyon by the outlaw, Butch Cavendish and his gang.

0,Great
0,Well acted and interesting story. A lesson of life on fils.
0,Awesome flic,  but very disturbing the nature of the murders and that it really happened.  Gives chills
0,I love horse movies and this one is no exception. In fact, this is one of my favorite movies. I first saw this movie as a kid when Disney first released it. I have never forgotten it. Ive only ever seen it on TV a few times and the last time was approximately 20 years ago, at which time I taped it on VHS. I no longer have a VHS machine, but I still have the tape. The quality/resolution of this DVD exceeds the version I have seen on TV in years past. I had never searched for this movie until recently. I had to buy it as soon as I saw it on Amazon. Even though I have read in a review that this DVD version is missing about three minutes from the original movie, Im still very happy to have this great family movie about the Morgan Horse in my library of movies.
0,Kiefer Sutherland delivers another heroic action packed thriller. This is one of the best series to follow. You will not be disappointed.
0,One of his best movies..
0,nice item. price is good. couldn't have asked for anything more. i was pleased with the overall purchase and everything.
0,its a great family movie
0,I never saw this film until recently. I am just now beginning to appreciate the films of Alan Rudolph. I love this film, now having watched it twice. I love the look of L.A. here and the assorted lonely characters who interact with each other in some way. Some of the reviewers have been pretty negative, but I am not one of them. I also purchased Choose Me, a later film of his and that one impressed me even more. Lesley Ann Warren was at her peak with that film, probably her greatest performance ever And I like the fact that he uses the same actors in his films, particularly Keith Carradine and Genevieve Bujold, both of whom are wonderful actors.
0,I think I've seen every iteration of the Nikita franchise and this one has turned out to be the best.  The underlying story is really quite grim but this time around they've mixed things up with enough suspense to really move things along and enough brutal violence to make Wayne LaPierre happy.  Why four stars?  Well, I just think that at this point (end of third season) the story has run out of gas.  Of course, I have no idea what's coming but the stories have gotten more and more fanciful and just hard to believe.		In case you haven't seen this Nikita, my favorite episode is the sensational "All The Way" from season two, where Nikita, having escaped Division, fights her way back in.  There are scenes in this episode that are as exciting as anything you'll see in the movies.  Since things have gotten pretty familiar by the third season, I enjoyed the few humorous bits.  Early in season 3, Nikita is at CIA headquarters, locked in a fight to the death with an equally attractive Russian agent.  Two unsuspecting CIA guys walk by and the girls have to stand down for a minute.  During this time out, Nikita complements the Russian on the great shoes she's wearing and the Ruskie gal says "thanks!"  Then they get back to trying to kill each other.		The best moment, I thought, of the entire 3rd season was when Owen returns to his hotel room where he has Amanda shackled to the bed.  Owen's just made a multi-million dollar deal and he plans to dispose of Amanda as soon as possible.  Obviously, this is a tense situation but Owen says "I hope you haven't been using the mini bar.  They really kill you with the prices on those things."
0,Thank you.
0,I have a relative whom REALLY likes this film  but , we could only find it on VHS! ( Thus , the reason why we bought it on video tape in the 21st Century! ). He's a big fan of Sophia Loren , so that sort of sweetened the deal. ( Not so sure about his feelings towards Marcello Mastroianni. ). Anyhow  the VHS version of this film , worked perfectly well in his antique VCR , and it made for a pleasing Christmas gift.
0,Great
0,Excellent tv series, glad it was available on dvd.
0,My memories is childhood
0,Purchased this DVD for my three year old grandson. Since not on television, found on Amazo. My grandson loves this DVD. A much for all children.
0,This was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It's one of those movies where everything that can go wrong in one night does but there is still a happy ending. Particularly I loved the music included because nearly all of them were popular songs that I've heard before and enjoyed. My favorite character has got to be Bones the biker guy because he is not one to be judged by appearances.		It's clear that they tried to insert some kind of message about Christianity in it, but it wasn't so big as to ruin the rest of the movie. All in all it's a great comedy that beats most others because there is no sex and only very minimal violence while the group tries to find the missing baby.
0,Well worth the bills for all its detail and story.  Keep in mind if you buy from amazon (new) you probably won't get the bright orange case/extra stuff as that's the first pressing of the movie (more than likely limited).  Could be a deal breaker for some.
0,Perhaps, like me, you've come here after watching "Behind Enemy Lines" featuring Owen Wilson and, of course, Gene Hackman, who happens to star in this underrated film.  Okay, the plot is almost the same as that action filck made with the technology of the year 2001, but, let me tell you, "BAT*21" gives its stress on a different matter than "Behind," and that is the characters played by the two leads.	As the film claims in the opening, the story about Lieutenant Colonel Iceal Hambleton whose airplane is shot down behind enemy lines in Vietnam is based on truth.  Now becoming "BAT*21," his code name, he has to rely on a radio by which he maintains a contact with a pilot Captain Bartholomew Clerk (Danny Glover), who instructs and encourages him to overcome all the barriers waiting for him on the ground.  But Lieutenant Colonel has no previous combat experience in his career, and the time for massive air raid that is certain to kill him is coming closer.	Frankly, some of the scenes are too incredible (especially when Captain tries to fly the helicopter, which he has not done for a long time).  And you cannot expect the high-octaine action sequences, because the film's real focus is set in other places; that is, the bond between the two leading characters, which develops gradually through the unreliable radio contact.  Precisely this human part is the greatest asset of "BAT*21" of which quality is raised by the extremely superb acting by Gene  Hackman.  He is, as usual with any first-rate actor you name, the real energy with his depiction of toughness and frailty, and his powerhouse performance lifts this sometimes clithed film to the above-average level among many other ones about this war.
0,Great drama
0,Great Series, clean & well done.  The box office Superman movies are garbage compared to these. Fantastic show.  Cannot say enough good things about it.
0,reminded me of DEAD SPACE the game.
0,Love Martin Clunes. This series is excellent.
0,From the days when Elmore Leonard was best known for his Westerns, 3:10 to Yuma come close to being a masterpiece but just falls short in the final reel. Along with a tight, tense narrative, it's extremely well directed by unfairly overlooked Delmar Daves, whose mastery of the camera is visible in almost every frame. It also boasts a dazzling star performance from Glenn Ford that many of today's stars could pick up a few tricks from: between them, Daves and Ford almost (but not quite) manage to pull off the completely out of character ending. Leaves High Noon eating its dust.
0,Predicable story with a different twist
0,This is quirky, poignant with a bit of apocalyptic sci-fi thrown in. Quvenzhan Wallis will win over your heart. Its not a movie for the feint of heart, with some difficult-to-watch scenes. And yet, you will leave this film with a feeling of triumph and the richer for the viewing.		I did have some issues getting it to play about 15 minutes in. We have high speed Internet with good broadband, so not sure what was going on there. Had to leave it for awhile and come back and then it was fine.
0,The Straw Hat Pirates have depended on their beloved ship "Going Merry" in many of their battles in sea.  But with the Going Merry needing repairs, thew crew was given a map to visit Water Seven.  And  when they arrive, they learn that the location has its share of powerful people.  Even pirates have been beaten by the local craftsmen, members of the Galley La Company.		But as the crew needs to get cash by exchanging their gold that they have earned in many of their adventures, Luffy, Usopp and Nami go to exchange the treasure for cash and to use it for repairs on the Going Merry.		But all things go wrong for the Straw Hat Pirates when a group known as the Franky Family end up stealing all of the money from the Straw Hat Pirates.		As Usopp goes to get the money back from Franky Family, he is beaten badly.  But when the Straw Hat Pirates come to help their friend, they easily beat the Franky Family but find out that the money is being spent on blackmarket goods by their leader and the money is gone.  Also, to make matters worse, Nico Robin is now missing.		To make things worse, the Galley La Company inspects the Going Merry and find out that it is in the worse shape that it is not fixable.  So, Luffy makes the decision to abandon the Going Merry and find a new ship.  But Usopp, who considers the Going Merry as family, goes against Luffy in his decision, leading to an argument and fight.		Now Usopp has decided to quite the Straw Hat Pirates and if he wins, he will be taking Going Merry and leaving.		As friends are torn apart by this fight between Luffy and Usopp, trouble arises when the Galley La Company suspect the Straw Hat Pirates are responsible for a crime.		Find out how the Straw Hat Pirates will deal with predicament in "One Piece: Season Four, Voyage Three"!		While the DVD release is listed as season four for America, in Japan, "One Piece: Season Four, Voyage Three" is the beginning of season eight (note: Actually, episode 229 - featured in voyage two, is the first episode that begins season eight).  As the Straw Hat Pirates reach the land of Water Seven where powerful craftsmen, the Galley La Company reside, the crew needs the craftsmen to fix the Going Merry, which has been involved in major wear and tear through the many adventures of the Straw Hat Pirates.		But when misfortune hits the Straw Hat Pirates and pits Luffy vs. Usopp and even Nico Robin has disappeared.  Things between the Straw Hat Pirates have gotten worse, but can they get any better?		VIDEO :		For most television series, because they are created nearly before they are aired on television, unlike film and OVA's, there typically is not much detail involved in a Japanese animated television series. "ONE PIECE" is probably one of those rare exceptions in that it has really cool character designs and very detailed artistic backgrounds. Of course, since it is on DVD, you will see some artifacting, combing and edge enhancement but it's not so noticeable unless you are really looking for it.		The anime series is presented in standard 4:3 definition but for a television series, "ONE PIECE" sports cool and unique character designs and beautifully painted artistic backgrounds. Definitely one of the better looking anime series that has remained consistent and has not downgraded since it first aired on television. Character designer Kazuya Hisada (who worked on the "Dragon Ball" and "Dragon Ball GT" series) and Noboru Koizumi (who worked on "Giant Robo", "Dragon Ball GT" and "Tenchi Universe") have been very good of capturing "One Piece" creator Eiichiro Oda's unique style.		It's important to note that in Japan, the 207th episode was the first "One Piece" episode to be broadcasted in HD and in widescreen. So, it will be interesting to see if FUNimation will release these later seasons on Blu-ray in the near future.		AUDIO & SUBTITLES:		As for the audio, the series is presented in English 5.1 Dolby Surround Sound, English Stereo and Japanese Stereo. Of course, the English 5.1 Dolby Surround Sound is the better audio choice to listen to, although one who has a receiver that can set their audio to all channels can definitely enjoy the Japanese stereo track as well. But both audio tracks are done very well and I have to admit that "ONE PIECE" has one of the most solid English dub tracks for an anime TV series. Very well done on both audio tracks but again, have been very impressed by the voice talent for the series thus far.		Subtitles are in English.		SPECIAL FEATURES:		"One Piece: Season Four, Voyage Three" comes with the following special features:		DISC 1:		  EPISODE 233 Audio Commentary - Audio commentary by Mike McFarland (Line Producer/ADR Director) and voice talents Brina Palencia (Chopper) and Phillip Webber (Iceberg).		DISC 2:		  EPISODE 236 Audio Commentary - Audio commentary by Mike McFarland (Line Producer/ADR Director) and voice talent Colleen Clinkenbeard (Luffy) and Sonny Strait (Usopp).	  Textless Songs - Textless songs for "Kokoro no Chizu" and "Eternal Pose".	  Trailers - Trailers for upcoming FUNimation Entertainment releases.		JUDGMENT CALL:		It's a brand new adventure for the Straw Hat Pirates, but when circumstances  put members at odds with one another, what happens when Usopp and Nico Robin decide they must part ways?		With this latest season of "One Piece", things are not well with the Straw Hat Pirates as their beloved ship, the Going Merry is suffering from major damage.  So, they end up going to Water Seven in hopes that the best craftsmen, known as the Galley La Company can repair their ship using the cash that they earned from the treasure they have acquired on past adventures.		But when the money is stolen by the Franky Family and news that the Going Merry is not repairable, this leads to Luffy having to make a major decision and that is to part ways with their ship.		But Usopp, who looks at the Going Merry as part of their family will fight Luffy in order to keep it.  But Luffy is the Captain and unfortunately, their disagreement goes as far as to causing problems between the two.  And as for Nico Robin, she has gone missing and rumors are running rampant that a shooting that injured Iceberg was committed by one of the Straw Hat Pirates, Nico Robin.		Not wanting to hurt the group, Robin wants to distance herself away from her friends.		With "One Piece: Season Four, Voyage Three", this is probably the most emotional season we have seen internally with the Straw Hat Pirates.  We have seen them fight against many rivals and opponents, but this time, the battle is within and for Usopp, he has seen himself lucky to be alive because he has no special abilities like the other Straw Hat Pirates.  But one thing he did believe in, was fighting as a family and that includes the Going Merry.		For Usopp, the ship is family that he does not want to see destroyed or left behind and when it pits him and Luffy against each other, we can see how it hurts the other Straw Hat Pirates to see one of their own leave.		But as they worry about one former shipmate, now they have to worry about another, especially for themselves as they are all wanted by the people they just befriended.		As for the DVD, you get 12-episodes and picture quality is very good. Especially in Japan, all "One Piece" episodes since 2007 have been broadcast in HD and widescreen in Japan, it would be interesting if that means the series would get a Blu-ray release in the United States. But for the DVD, the DVD is colorful, vibrant and looks good on DVD, but it would be interesting to see how this series would look in HD and I'm looking forward to whenever that day comes. Audio is good, dialogue is clear. And for special features, there are two fun audio commentaries featuring the English dub voice talent, textless opening and ending themes plus trailers.		Overall, I enjoy the adventures of the Straw Hat Pirates and I'm in it for the long haul. While, we are 241 episodes down and are over 340-episodes behind Japan, it is the longest running action anime series in Japan and the fact that young and old continue to read and watch this series, its a testament of how addictive "One Piece" really is.  But what it comes down to is if you want to get started on a long anime series.		Personally, you can join in on any season and still be interested in "One Piece".  If you are new and want to jump in, just make sure it's the first voyage of the season, so you get an idea of what's going on.  While it would be good to at least catch the first season to know what the goal of the Straw Hat Pirates is and how they all joined to form their crew (note: you can either look for the anime series or purchase the manga).		Exciting, crazy and one of the awesome anime series that is still airing in Japan and being released in the US, "One Piece: Season Four, Voyage Three" is recommended!

0,I went searching for Spot videos for my preschooler and toddler. My older kids enjoyed Spot when they were little, but VCRs went out of style and we no longer had the VHS tapes. I wanted the American version with Jonathan Taylor Thomas as the voice of Spot. That's what this one is. It's cute, simple, and fun for the little ones. They both love it. Great price, too.
0,Great
0,Great family movie even if it is "old school."
0,Great!!!

0,This movie is hilarious, mainly in the kid's preformance. I believe Ice Cube did a great job in this as well. The little boy was my favorite character. I picked up a copy the first day, having loved it in the theatre. Don't listen to these people saying its bad, you'll laugh, and at times you'll want to even cry.
0,Kids love this
0,Good movie for the whole family. Good life lessons. Enjoyable !
0,I really  enjoyed the series. There were such strong personality traits in the characters that made them more realistic than so many of the hero detectives we see today. I enjoy the British detective series and hope that there will be more!
0,I now have the complete season of the tv show that i grew up watching all them year ago. just love them
0,My son loves this series and I was very happy to be able to get him the seasons he was missing.
0,Great acting and intense.
0,If you like Mr. Bean then you should have this on your shelf.  We enjoyed all the episodes and will likely watch them over and over.
0,good flick
0,This British TV series has a cast of very unique characters, and along with the beautiful setting of Portwenn, this series is great family entertainment.
0,Wow, this was really good! Al Jazeera is said to be too pro-American by the Arab world and has too much propaganda according to Mr. Bush and Donald Rumsfield.		But in reality, Al Jazeera is about as unbiased as you can get. They report everything, I mean literally everything as it happens, uncensored and people blame for trying to show things their way. An example is, our U.S. government thought that Al Jazeera was taking a supposedly "pro-Saddam" view by showing the dead civilians in Iraq.  Then on the same note, our government got mad that Al Jazeera showed the POWs and dead American soldiers when all Al Jazeera is trying to do is show that there is a human cost to war by showing the very unfortunate deaths on both sides.		In Control Room, American soldiers, the U.S. government, Iraqis, and people who work at Al Jazeera talk uncensored about their opinions and feelings.		The part that I thought was the most powerful is when a Al Jazeera worker is upset about the way U.S. government is handling it's foreign policies but admires the U.S. public and our constitution - he says that he believes in our constitution and Americans have enough sense and power to do what is right and they will.		This is a great documentary if want to see news which actually follows the saying - we report you decide.
0,Fun brit sci-fi series that anyone who is a fan of this genre should enjoy. The basic premise is that there's this portal that allows aliens to travel to Cardiff, Wales. Torchwood is the hip & sexy team of geniuses formed to identify & study anything/anyone who travels through the portal. It's set in present day, but is headed by an American naval flier who is a time traveler, among other amazing things. If this sparks your interest at all give it a try. I think you'll enjoy it!
0,Being from the age of ABBA and loving all of their music this movie brings back memories while tying their songs together into a wonderful storyline. This is a movie for all generations to watch and a must see!
0,This is not your typical Medieval swords and knights movie. First it takes place during the great plague (ie:Black Death) and its pretty dark and gruesome pretty much as you might think it was. While in search of witches etc. which it was believed caused the plague the group led by Sean Bean's character come upon an isolated village devoid of the plague. Obviously something's up there but it is only revealed bit by bit as the movie goes on. Really dark and creepy well directed and acted this movie was not only a pleasant surprise but one of my favorites of 2010. Great performances by Sean Bean, Carice van Houten and Eddie Redmayne. But really by the entire cast and a wonderful job done by Christopher Smith with his dark gritty and atmospheric direction. If you like this kind of movie run don't walk to buy it. It's a great addition to anyone's film library.
0,Wow.  The special martial arts action was fantastic.  Fun to watch with a little weirdness thrown in.
0,I wanted my own copies of this series!
0,Dressed to Kill (1946) has the distinction of being the final film starring Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Dr. Watson, and I think it closed out the series on something of a high note.  The film has a few weaknesses, but it does place the art of deduction on a pedestal above and beyond the action, and that is just what I want out of a Sherlock Holmes film.  Needless to say, the plot is not based on any work of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, but it does try to place itself within the milieu of the canon.  Early on, we see Dr. Watson perusing the latest issue of The Strand; A Scandal in Bohemia has just been published, and this leads to a few comments on "the woman," Irene Adler.  This sets up the new case in hand, one in which Holmes finds himself greatly tested by yet another woman.  Hilda Courtney (Patricia Morrison) is no Irene Adler, but she is devilishly clever enough to pose quite an interesting and dangerous challenge to the great detective.		Like many of the classic Holmes stories, this adventure starts with a common object - a music box.  One of Watson's old friends stops by and describes the theft of one of the plainest music boxes in his collection the night before.  Thinking it odd that a thief would steal only a seemingly insignificant piece of the collection, Holmes sets his mind to looking for an explanation more complicated than any petty thief theory.  He soon finds himself on a search for three music boxes, each of which plays the same tune (but with minor differences).  The ultimate quarry is a set of stolen plates from the Bank of England.  Convinced that the music boxes contain some type of code pointing to the location of the plates, Holmes is hard pressed to figure out the secret of the boxes.  His foe is a clever one; not only is she capable of playing Watson for a fool, she is clever enough to outmaneuver Holmes himself.		A needlessly elaborate method of disposing once and for all of the meddling detective definitely weakens the effectiveness of this story, but all in all I found this a perfectly enjoyable Holmesian adventure.  Watching Holmes try to figure out the secret of the music boxes calls to mind the spirit of Holmes' original adventures and showcases the detective doing what he does best.
0,Del Toro never ceases to amaze me! Marvelous story! Beautifully scary and visually stunning! I won't be the spoiler so if you loved Mama, this is a must see!
0,As a 4th movie very good.
0,An interesting concept added to a controversial sub context. if we only knew and would we want to.
0,Great mix of scary and humor with good acting and a "who done it " theme. I have watched it before and still enjoy it the second time around.
0,This is a great movie with a great message.	A definite must watch if you want to spend some quality time.
0,This is not a Spiritual video as it is created by Scientists evaluating physics yet I was continually amazed at how this material coincides with so many Spiritual principles of connectedness, and multi-dimensional along with parallel realities.  I could not recommend something more if you feel bleak or lost as this will surely provide you a different perspective.		Enjoy!
0,A new twist on a old story. I like this version
0,A classic for our family.
0,I was surprised by how much I loved this tightly written and sharply directed (Rupert Wyatt) prequel to Pierre Boulle's 1963 novel and the fine 1968 Franklin J. Schaffner film starring Charlton Heston as an astronaut who unwittingly returns to a future earth populated by intelligently evolved apes.  The subsequent films in the franchise were increasingly cheesy, but this prequel is a class act that stays on track with terrific action sequences that advance the story and crank up the tension of a desperate and dying human race.  The motion capture primates (there's a gorilla and a wise orangutan) are superb in their close-ups.  Even their eyes are rich in expression and detail.  The superb primate-miming Andy Serkis is the catalyst to surrendering disbelief.  The several allusions to Heston and the original film are subtle and perfectly integrated into the story.
0,very good
0,I espeically like thje death camp torrence episode.		They 1st showed the gerbil go in the gay mans ass(Mr Slave), lol
0,This set is funny EVERY time I watch it. Every time I have a guest who does not know this character ends up laughing their head off. The sound and picture quality is first rate and the packaging is wonderful except for one error on the info which exchanges 2 episodes on the actual discs.		 The ONLY disappointment is the "Turkey Contest and weigh-in" and another scene in the furniture department where he out wits a potential female customer on a lounge chair by rigging the wiring to fold her up in it... a very funny scene, unfortunately missing here. Never mind, there is so much more to this set and with the extras and good price, you will have many hours of fun on this one.		 The family will find it funny but be warned, Mr. Bean does appear naked in a couple of scenes.... but no one would dare want to look at his little body anyway, its strictly for laughs, and it works!
0,Derek Jacobi, Vanessa Redgrave, Albert Finney; oh my. What a cast! And a ripping good story to boot!
0,every conspiracy theorist must watch this
0,Great
0,Thomas Vinterberg's Celebration is without question one of the best of the Danish Dogme (spelled this way in Denmark, not Dogma) 95 films.	As the film opens, we see various people, in groups of two, three, and more, converge on a large house--walking, driving, and bicycling.  They are gathering to celebrate the 60th birthday of the man who fathered four children--they who have now come to pay their respects with their wives, husbands, boyfriends and girlfriends.  The man has made a tidy sum thanks to his unnamed business, and he and his wife live quite comfortably.  Also invited are the older couple's friends, and by the time everyone has arrived, there is a full house indeed, all seated at the host's large dinner table.	Speeches are made, glasses are chinked together in toasts, food is eaten.  The daughter has a black American boyfriend and it's a wicked foreshadowing that has him insulted by one of his girlfriend's brothers--an out and out racist remark.	This sets the stage for a shocking turn of events when one of the man's sons stands and proposes a toast to his father that leaves the guests completely stunned.  A dark secret is revealed that is so out of place with the reason for the "celebration", nothing can ever be the same following the younger man's toast.	The drama here is powerful, intense, seething.  One of the trademark strengths of Dogme 95 cinema, as many of us know by now, is its focus on story alone, without reliance on any special effects--CGI, lighting, or otherwise--and Vinterberg has here wisely chosen a story so strong that to "enhance" it with anything remotely resembling special effects would be doing it a major disservice--would be, in fact, blatantly stupid.	This is one of the best Danish films of the 20th century and should absolutely not be missed.	Very highly recommended.
0,Loved this movie, I am a sucker for these story lines.
1,It was great reading everyone's heads-up on all the music being replaced in season 2. After being impressed by the first season on DVD, season 2 "sounds" like a disaster. Like many, I still have all 120 episodes on VHS tape, recorded from Arts And Entertainment cable in 1990, but they are beginning to wear out, have 5 minutes edited from each episode, and lack decent color in season four. The color in Quinn Martin's abc series "The Invaders", season one, on CBS DVD, is outstanding, and is what a fourth season of "The Fugitive" would have looked like on remastered DVD, had it ever made it to release. Oh...well...
1,The moment I saw Rob's Wife and that horse I actually laughed! What a ludicrous way to put his Wife who CANNOT ACT in his film. I watched it with commentary to see what he said about this and he added the horse idea because one day on the way to the shoot he saw a horse?! Anyhow, HORRIBLE as you actually WANT Laurie to get killed! She was as unlikeable as the White trash scattered throughout the film. The language was appalling. This was Haddonfield, not Rob's home which he obviously after viewing his other so called films grew up around. There was NO need for that profanity from the lead character. Dr Loomis is now a jerk obsessed with fame? Danielle Harris was excellent and the ONLY reason to watch this. I was really hoping Michael would kill off Rob's Wife lol! Pathetic.
1,Well, I watched this nonsense twice. Yes, Italy looks nice, chicks hot, plenty of skin, plot awful. Producer dragging his foot till the end	hoping for something that never happened. Most important in this flick suppose to be supernatural but as this is not Jess Franco its all hope.	Sex parts severely stupid and dated and, in plain English, boring and, by contrast, remind me  'Midnight party'--yes, Lina Romay  always deliver.
1,Can't believe this movie cost 150 million dollars. The only good thing was the mythological creatures. Too much talking and not enough action. Not even Fiennes and Neeson can save this movie. There was some fighting scenes with weapons and they were badly edited with too many quick,close up cuts.		Save your money and if you're curious to watch it. Wait for the dvd. Only good performances were from Toby Kebell which was the comic relief.
1,every now and then, critics gang up on a movie, a book, a play of highest quality, and condemn it, or lowest, and praise it up likewise, as an unbreakable phalanx, and in direct contradiction of popular opinion.  they do this in order to sustain their authority.  after all, if they are always concurring with plebians, then who needs critics?  this is not one of those times.  i suggest as an alternate selection safe house...ciao.
1,Let me see... another idiot Adam Sandler movie where he talks like an idiot, dresses like an idiot and acts like an idiot, surrounded by a bunch of supporting idiots. Well, do I need to say more?
1,I was furious when I hastily purchased this for a 48 hour rental only to find out that this is the dubbed version!		Why, is there no original Thai version with English subtitles? This is a travesty.		Netflix often offers the option to switch between language and subtitle options on the fly during a film- why is this feature absent here?		My wife is from Thailand and was excited to watch Chocolate again and for me to see it for the first time,		During the first 5 minutes of the movie we were shaking our heads at the abysmal dubbing and voice acting they ruined this film with.
1,Again, Jonah Hill seems to be the common thread in a recent string of nonsensical movies. I was not sure if this thing was trying to be a sex ed movie or what! Thank God Heigl is easy to look at, but not believable hooking up with the dork squad.	As other reviewers have stated; I expected more from the 40 year old virgin director.
1,May be the worst spaghetti western ever made.  The barest sliver of a plot coupled with screwball acting.  Movie is so bad that it was almost surreal.
1,I purchased this set as a gift for someone who is losing their hearing and needs to use the closed caption feature. Although the description and the packaging describe the DVDs as closed captioned, they are not. Very disappointing.
1,Ehh
1,I tried to stay with it, but ultimately -- I drifted. Another Asian movie about homosexuality without any homosexual sexuality.
1,Too bad because while the film was formulaic and predictable (where any sport might have been substituted i.e. fill in if you like: race car driver, boxer, jockey, long distance runner, tennis player, sumo wrestler) with some tweaks here and there and a shift of focus upon and including some elaborated nuances of the game itself... hey, where all the drama was driving the film anyway, rather than allowing the cornball romantic interludes to intrude and diminish it? It might have been a great baseball movie where very few of the genre exist.	And Costner, as he proved in Field of Dreams, was just the guy to pull it off at that particular moment in time.	An unfortunate missed opportunity sadly lost forever.
1,You know the old saying, Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.  And YES, you heard that old chestnut here first!  Unaware of the music alteration, I DID buy S.2-V.1 but how can CBS/Paramount possibly think anyone would trust them to fix the music bastardization of S.2-V.1?  With all the public criticism, are the CBS suits so demented to actually distribute another debacle like Vol. 1?  I guess the asnswer is YES!		Remember Dr. Smith on Lost In Space quoting, "Oh the pain"!  The entire season two has been a complete washout and is just painful to watch.
1,Stephen King's rose red is a pretty stale film from start to finish while it grips you at times it just fails to catch your attention due to it's cliche formula throughout, the visuals also where a bit of a let down and whilst i'm not the type of person to mock a film for small errors these where just too bad. This film definatley had the potential it just failed to appear due to it's mis-haps, the ghosts where they sorround the wrong doer at the end (sound familiar) just really didn't get to me as your seeing nothing new just the same old pretentious horror movie with a lack of creativity, thats the thing with Stephen King aswell his books tend to focus on typical horror settings it's never anything new which alot of people who watch films like to see, i suppose it's enjoyable to a certain extent it just lacks the flare and creativity that would really be refreshing in this movie genre however i may have insulted this film (with my own opinions) but i would recommened it to fans of this genre or general Stephen King fans as in the fans eyes this would be seen as a good film.
1,Really...this is a yawn. With all the CGI and potential, this movie just falls flat. They have turned a classic novel into a dragging film that is mediocre at best. Don't waste the $$.
1,Never did see the meaning of this movie-really weird-stupid show. I kept watching thinking it had to get better but it never did!
1,Very difficult to watch.  The movie kept stopping.  Had to restart it several times.  The download was terrible.
1,This is one of those films that would probably cater to those who are able to see beauty in anything that is SUPPOSED TO BE beautiful, whether actual beauty exists or not.  It reminds me of the story of the emperor who has no clothes.  Some of you may know this story.  It's the story about an emperor who wants a great garment-worker to make him a garment for a great event.  The garment-worker has trouble coming up with a truly original design that will impress the emperor, so he chooses to tell the emperor that the garment is so unique and exquisite that it's invisible.  The emperor puts on the "invisible" garment and goes to the event naked.  Because the public is talking to, and about, the emperor, everyone comments on how beautiful his clothes are.  Only a child points out the obvious by saying, "But Mommy, the emperor has no clothes".		This film and films like it, fall into this category for me.  If you show enough people something that is completely senseless, and chaotic, some will find it to be beautiful because it was made by a great name (In this case Anthony Hopkins).  Or maybe they want to believe that it is designed to stimulate their intellect, so they make something out of nothing and call it genius.  It may be possible that this film, and films like it such as "The Fountain", are simply over-my-head.  But to me they're just chaos and confusion on the screen that is then passed of as being genius.		My guess is that more than 99% of the population will find this movie to be crap.  The other 1% is able to look at crap and convince themselves that something transcendent is taking place.  So if you're like most people, you probably won't like this movie.  If you choose to see it, you certainly shouldn't get your hopes up.  I realize that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but it's still true that most people wouldn't choose the word "cute" to describe a spider.		%%%%%% The following is an update to my review %%%%%%%		I was looking through my amazon reviews and have noticed that many people have not found this review to be helpful.  After reading it again, myself, I can understand why.  I failed to really say much about the movie, itself, other than that it is so abstract to the point of being terrible.  For this reason, I have decided to add more content to this review pertaining to the actual plot of the movie itself.		The movie contains lots of big-name actors that you've seen before including Christian Slater and Anthony Hopkins himself.  So acting ability isn't the problem with this movie.  The problem is that it's basically a senseless feature film that boils down to things going on that make absolutely no sense.		Imagine a director turning on a camera and telling the actors to just react to whatever is going on around them.  Don't give them a script, and don't offer a plot.  Just tell them to talk to each other about things that make no sense, jumping from subject to subject so that anyone watching would wonder "what in the world is going on?".  Then imagine the director telling the audience that the movie is about a director who is losing his mind -- That's "Slipstream".  That's the movie.		As I've said before.  There is no way for me to appreciate this movie because it made absolutely no sense whatsoever.  So for me, it's like someone showing you a blank sheet of paper and saying that it's a picture of polar bear in a snow storm.  Some may call this clever, but it's really just a blank piece of paper.		I don't know if this will make my review more useful to those who read it, but I really don't know what else to say about this movie.
1,Ya know I really want to like this movie and ignore most of the reviews. But I see that most of the reviews are true. This is a very hard movie to follow. I gave up a little past the mid point and turned it off.		The effects are very good and a redeeming point. My suggestion is to rent it before you buy it. I ended up selling mine on EBay to recoup a bit of my cost of buying it.
1,Watch this movie for the sound, picture, etc, but not the plot. There is no plot, just unsatisfying glipses into the minds of soldiers. True, it is an interesting attempt, but in the way it is executed  the entertainment  fails misersably.
1,Got  it smashed to pieces
1,Usually I like a good costume drama but I thought this to be tedious and very slow moving. I'll stick with Masterpiece Theatre from now on for my English period fix.
1,Over wrought melodramatic acting near its worst almost match by the music & directing.  The actors seem to explore every corner of a room from every angle as well as ever chair & sofa.  If the movie weren't so long, I could almost laugh.		Tyrone Power plays a former WWI pilot trying to find peace in post-WWI Chicago, Paris, India, and the French Riviera always pursued by Gene Tierney, a rich, spoiled, self-centered girl who never grows up or give up her demand for money.		One review claimed this film is thought-provoking.  True -- I kept thinking when will this ever end!
1,I watched the film with my teenaged daughter and her two friends during a sleepover. The movie wasn't as scary or suspenseful as we had hoped.  The effects weren't that great, and it wasn't very original.		I would not recommend this movie. There are many better horror movies available.
1,Wow, where do I start?  From the title on, this movie sucks.  Attack of the clones?  I could think of a better title for this movie in the next five seconds.  It sounds like the title of a B-list horror film, like Attack of the Killer Tomatoes or something cheesy like that.  Sadly, this movie wasn't meant to be a farce.  George Lucas was being serious when he made this garbage.  The story is slow.  The plot is unengaging.  Lucas seems more concerned with his so-called "plot" than in actual entertaining and storytelling.  This is why the first two (and possibly the third) prequels suck.  There is too much senate crap in this episode, and too many new characters for those who aren't familiar with Star Wars.  I've been a Star Wars fan for most of my life, and even I had trouble following along.  All the evil characters have two or three different names (Count Dooku, Darth Tyrannus, etc.), and there are too many characters to care about all of them.  The acting is terrible, almost laughably bad.  Samuel L. Jackson is among the worst.  It's almost like he's playing the role of the Black Jedi, strictly for racial diversity.  And speaking of diversity, what's the deal with Jango Fett and Boba Fett being Polynesian?  That's unacceptable.  Does Lucas feel like he has to include every race in his movies?  Will the next Jedi be Hispanic?  They should never have showed either of the Fett's faces in the movie.  You just don't picture a Poly under that mask and armor.  That really annoyed me, because it's such a blatant attempt to diversify the cast.  I'm glad they both die.  Hayden Christiansen is a very bad actor.  Lucas likes to cast newcomers for some reason, probably so he can take credit for discovering the next big thing.  Sorry George, you failed with Jake Lloyd and again with Hayden.  Natalie Portman, who is usually a good actress, was really bad in AOTC.  There were a few entertaining parts in the movie (Yoda's fight with Dooku, the arena scene, the chase in the city) but I wouldn't watch the whole thing again for a long time.  I have the DVD (I got it as a gift) and have yet to watch the whole thing straight through.  That's a bad commentary.  I'm not a Star Wars hater.  I'm just being honest.  Attack of the Clones was better than the Phantom Menace, but still very bad.  Trust me.
1,I honestly thought that Arnold was making fun of his own career in this movie it was that bad. ... Totally boring, unbelivable and wooden.
1,eeehhhh
1,It was do awful at the beginning I didn't watch it.
1,What the .... ?  I could not follow this ... maybe because it bored me.  First I thought it was because I was tired.  Attempted to watch it again - same reaction.  I gave up
1,I remember when this movie came out because it was arguably the best theater experience in my life. For months the hype had been building to a fever pitch, as me and my friends battled in the front yard with light-sabers, played the soundtracks constantly, read the Star Wars books, downloaded the trailers, and talked ENDLESSLY in speculation. And what with the media hype and advertising campaigns... well you get the idea. Then of course there was the opening night.		I waited in line for hours for a good seat, and that's only because my friends had been waiting in line for me since around 6:00 AM. When the people in from the previous showing came out there were cheers and screams so loud you couldn't hear yourself think (and earlier in the day my friends made the cover a newspaper with their cheering and cardboard sign holding {honk if you love Star Wars!}). When at last I finally got IN, the theater was packed with something like 300 people who were clapping their hands and stamping their feet BEFORE the movie started. I was so blown by the visuals (special effects), sound editing, fight scenes ect. that I saw the movie ELEVEN times in the theater!		Then my enthusiasm lessoned. I figured out what everyone meant when they talked about the wooden acting (the kid who plays Anakin is the worst, but the Queen is pretty bad too), bad dialog (Jar Jar is so bad it hurts my head), and a THIN plot. Above all, this film is badly directed. Scenes that could be cool instead feel forced, and lifeless. Every moment in the film is loaded with eye-candy, and eventually you may figure out (as I did) that without the eye-candy, there is NOTHING HAPPENING 90% of the time. No intrigue, no character development, nothing.		Of course almost every film has its good points. I'll say it again, AWESOME visuals. Sweet sound edited and not a bad sountrack (duel of the fates was sweet, no arguements there). Our new Obi-Wan was easily the best thing about the movie, and was totally believable in the role. Old senator Palpatine's manuevering and manipulating is great stuff. And Darth Maul, the guy with like two lines and only one purpose in the film (look evil, look scarey, try to kill the good guys, impress the audience, die) puts up one heck of a cool fight against our two jedi at the end of the film. Oh, and the fight choreography is sweet too, with the jedi knights slicing through droids like a hot knife through melting butter. But that does NOT a good movie make.		This movie is a must have on one condition. If you have a great sound system and a huge high-def TV the sweet visuals and sound edits will definitely please as far as picture and sound tests go. Just go straight to one of the battle scenes (or my favorite, the pod race), and crank up the volume. Nice.		At any rate, there are people who will love anything with the Star Wars name plastered on it no matter WHAT it is. This is one of those things. Personally I thought both of the prequels have been incredible disappointments compared to what they coulde have been. If you want more Star Wars and you're a serious fan, read some of the expanded universe books, play Knights of the Old Republic or one of the Jedi Knight games, or watch the excellent Clone Wars cartoons released by Cartoon Network. Just don't watch this one expecting greatness. It is not there.
1,Acting was so horrible it almost ruined the entire movie. Its best to watch this movie with the sound turned off.
1,I've seen my share of stupid movies, I've seen zombies bite though people's skulls, a giant snake slither though LA without anyone seeing it, and people taking out giant rhinos with a spear, but this movie takes the cake. There are really only two things I have to tell you about to prove this movie stupid, I don't even have to talk about the awful acting or the crazy nonsense plot. one, they shoot down a helicopter with a Civil War cannon that's been buried under the sand in the SAHARA desert for 150 years, and an armored column surrenders to cavalry.		Here's why that's so insanely stupid for all those who don't get it, and I'm going to use historical examples to prove it. During the battle of Gettysburg the army of Northern Virginia opened fire on the union army with their long ranged cannon, and MISSED! They couldn't even hit an army. now, fast forward to the modern day, give a cannon that's been buried under the sand since the end of the war to three Indiana Jones want to be's and give them the most impossible target to hit, a helicopter. What do you think happens? Well, they shoot it down, duh.		Second, an entire armored column, I think there must have been more then a dozen tanks, surrenders to an enemy army on horse back. Now, does anyone remember when the Polish army fought German tanks during WWII? Anyone? Well I'll tell you, uh, they died. Yeah, they all got killed because there is no possible way for mounted cavalry to defeat armor, and yet the tankers in this movie didn't seem to know that. Pathetic.		There's a lot more I could rant about, like how on earth could a Civil War battleship get to the Sahara desert, but I think I've made my point. This movie is simply one of the dumbest ever made, and I've seen some doozies. Stay away, for the love of god, stay away from this flick and just see Indiana Jones.		Replay value; Very low.
1,Where to start? Given the recent crop of actually good superhero movies ("Batman Begins" being at the top of the list, followed by "The Incredibles," "Spider-Man 2" and a few others), I had high hopes for this film. I confess, I know nothing about the comic-book history of the Fantastic Four, so I relied on the film to give me all the information I needed.		The film turns out to have done too thorough a job at this. There is suprisingly little action in the movie; at least the first hour is seemingly devoted to nothing but listing names and occupations and nick-names and special powers and responsibilities and theories and...well, you get the idea. I have nothing against a little backstory ("Batman Begins" is almost nothing but backstory and yet is one of the best movies I've seen in a long while) but "Fantastic Four" takes so long setting up the story that it fails to interest me in the protagonists. Additionally, their superhero names all-too-frequently are so similar to others that I had difficulty establishing them as unique entities.		The acting, for the most part, is lacklustre at best, though how much of this is the high-school-play-style script's fault and how much responsibility lies with the actors is an open question. I've been a fan of Ioan Gruffudd's since his Horatio Hornblower days, and he's acquitted himself well in many things, but here his Mr. Fantastic (could there BE a less inventive name for the guy?) is ramrod-stiff and unengaging as a dreary goody-two-shoes who couldn't be less believeable as a superhero if he tried. Jessica Alba is a pretty face but very little else as the Invisible Girl, and her smarmy yet surprisingly vapid delivery doesn't help me believe that she's a scientist or astronaut or whatever she's supposed to be. Julian McMahon is not quite as bad as Dr. Victor Von Doom, but really...why does that surname not make anyone in this movie uncomfortable? Isn't it rather a tip-off to his character? The only people who are at all engaging or entertaining to watch in this film are Michael Chiklis, who brings a certain pathos to his role as The Thing (though one really never gets to see much of his face beneath the foam latex, which is a shame), and Chris Evans as the Human Torch, who doesn't seem to be taking anything seriously and is the only one to nail the vapid light-heartedness that this film sorely needs.		The special-effects are sorely underwhelming, even cartoonish, which may or may not be intentional but look morbidly out of place on a large screen. This movie may be the only one this summer to have a chance of being improved by watching it on DVD. The Thing is very, very obviously Michael Chiklis in a foam latex suit. Mr. Fantastic is really, really NOT fantastic, and it's rather gruesome to watch him stretch and bend quite as much as he does, particularly as he gets grainier with every, ahem, stretch of the imagination. The plot does not suffer from the constraints of logical plausibility, nor does it appear to have given the screen-writers and story consultants much of a headache in terms of plotting or continuity as there clearly wasn't much effort put into it. I left the theatre more perplexed than I was when the movie began, never a pleasant way to leave a film experience.		I suppose I was most disappointed by the fact that it could have been a Good Dumb Movie, along the lines of the first two "Mummy" films, but fails spectacularly. The potential ramifications of being thrust into superhero-dom are not explored at all, nor are the complicated relationships that would inevitably arise from their situations. The only time the film really touches on this is when Ben Grimm/The Thing is unceremoniously (and embarassingly publicly) dumped by his wife because she cannot stand what he has become, but even this problem is handily dispatched by giving him a blind girlfriend. The potentially destructive powers of these people are never examined - the Human Torch can burn at supernova temperatures, which would destroy the earth, we are told, but it is all done rather flippantly, as though the thought of someone as irresponsible as Johnny Storm having the power to incinerate our planet wasn't something extraordinary and dangerous.		Even the roles that these characters would play in saving the world from disaster are not really defined, though their powers are explained and demonstrated at length. For instance, in the Four's first outing, the Human Torch (my, this naming thing gets repetitive) saves a girl from a fiery explosion by setting himself ablaze and holding her tightly to form a shield around her...but since he can burn at supernova temperatures and is ON FIRE while he's holding her, I cannot see where this wouldn't have been just as deadly to the poor little girl. Wreaking havoc on innocent bystanders is hardly a good thing for superheroes to do, yet the rescues by the Four are usually required by their own incompetence. Inconsistencies like this are everywhere, pointing to a sloppy storytelling job that is simply inexcusable.		Ultimately, if you've already seen "Batman Begins," "War of the Worlds," "Mr. and Mrs. Smith," and, well, everything else playing at your local multiplex, "Fantastic Four" isn't a completely horrid way to spend $6. There are a few good laughs and, as utter popcorn movies go, it's not the dumbest I've ever seen. If you have no other option and desperately really need to see something one lazy summer afternoon, this will do. And it is still better than "Herbie: Fully Loaded."
1,Very boring.
1,I really , really tried to watch this movie, but I just could not stand to watch much of it.		I found it annoying to try and watch.		Now that I am older, I appreciate movies about life's experiences ....	films like THE STRAIGHT STORY,  DOOR TO DOOR, etc ...		But somehow this movie seemed to abstract, incohesive and "artsy"		It felt like well framed scenes pasted together in random fashion but the sum of the parts ended up less than the whole.		Rather than get pulled in and compelled to watch, it was more of an effort to watch to the point it simply was not worth the effort -------- no care or concern for the characters at all.		After a few attempts, I simply could not tolerate more than 30 minutes of it.		The 2 people watching it with me were of the same opinion.		Beautifully filmed scenes, but it just never came together as a compelling story.		The background DRONING monotone music and heavy repetitive pedal points also were annoying
1,"Penguins!" is the worst penguin video I have ever seen.		First of all, the cover shows Emperor penguins but there are no Emperor penguins on this video.  The video only shows Humboldt penguins.		I like Humboldt penguins but these penguins are not in the wild.  The entire video was shot in the zoo.  Not only that, but apparently the photographer did not have any special access, so it was shot from outside the enclosure using consumer grade video equipment.  The camera quality is poor and the entire video was shot on a single visit.  There is no narration or sound from the penguin exhibit.  The only sound is some really lousy music.		This is one of the cheesiest videos I have ever seen.  Do not buy this video!
1,This was one of the most ridiculous movies I have ever seen..	The main problem being it takes itself seriously at least Piranha was campy and the effects in piranha were cool,these effects were hilarious in a bad way.	they used the same under water CGI shark for almost every scene and when the shark was above water it was like a Muppet.	The acting was horrible and I couldn't wait for it to end. There were so many miscues such as people being in 3 feet of water and the shark sneaking up on them yet the shark was supposed to be about 30 feet long and it would be sucking air at that depth. Too many more to even mention. Carmen Electra looked like an idiot trying to be extra sexy throwing back her hair and posing every 5 minutes..She's still beautiful but Really ? It's just plain bad and I like cheesy films.this had no cheese appeal it is an epic FAIL.

1,ok...after browsing a few opinions of the film, i have decided that it is bad, but also includes a lot of action, and cinema work that is at least no worse than wedding reception quality...i could use the action, but my instincts, combined with the experience of about 8,000 watched movies, are warning me away...so i think no...ciao.
1,Sandra Bullock is Lucy, a pro bono lawyer passionately devoted to saving the community from rapacious developers.  One day she is lying on the pavement between an historic building and the wrecker's ball when she meets playboy George (Hugh Grant), the public spokesman for the very corporation that wants to knock down the landmark.  George is between lawyers at the moment (his CEO brother fired the last one), and when he finds out Lucy actually has a degree from Harvard, he impulsively offers her a job and a promise to spare her Coney Island rec center.		And from there on it was just annoying.  A couple of critics called this screenplay undernourished; I'd say emaciated.  The best romantic comedies have a busy, likable supporting cast to add layers of interest and tone to the primary storyline (remember Notting Hill and While You Were Sleeping?); Grant and Bullock were pretty much on their own.  The two of them, mostly just the two of them, George`s outrageous insensitivity and Lucy's indignation in the same tiresome pattern that begged for denouement long before Lucy finally gave her two weeks' notice.  What bridesmaid leaves her cell phone on at the altar of her best friend's wedding, anyway?  And it still took too long for this to end.  Grant had a lot of witty one-liners; but I thought he was too offhand, as if contemptuous of the material.  Bullock was charming, but not charming enough to save this mess.		Obviously, production costs were kept to the minimum.  Locations were unvaried, supporting cast almost invisible, cinematography bland, clothes blah.  Bullock as Producer must have figured that two big stars would bring in the audience before word spread how awful this really was.  And she thought this romantic comedy was so good, she couldn't possibly make a better one?  I'm pretty charitable when it comes to a movie of this genre.  It only has to look good, sound good, and make me feel good.  This one was zero for three.		I've learned something.  If you're reading these reviews in order to decide whether or not to purchase the dvd, don't go by "Most Helpful" reviews.  People get on here and vote Yes, it was helpful, when they have already seen the movie and agree with the review.  This tends to inflate positive reviews.  Instead, look at the star rating profile at the top.  If most people really loved the movie and you probably will, too, the profile will have a bulge at 5 stars tapering down smoothly to a very thin or non-existent tail at 1.  If instead of a smooth descent from 5 the distribution is lumpy; or especially if 1-plus-2's add up to about the same as the 5's, maybe you ought to rent first.  Take a look at this one's profile.
1,I purchased this double for Richard Boone's performance.  Unfortunately, the movie was terrible and his much vaunted performance was not comparable to many of his other films and his iconic TV personna, Paladin.  The production itself is also very poor.  Looks like a copy off a poor VHS tape which has seen too many days.  If you're into quality westerns just re-watch The Searchers and give this a complete miss.  I gave it one star for Richard, the film and the DVD transfer are not even worth a star.
1,Not worth the time to watch
1,I'm not a big fan of the 10 Minute Solution series and this DVD just confirms it for me. Jennifer Galardi is a pleasent instructor and the workout is not extremely bad, but nothing I want to do again. The first two sections are soso, but then it just gets worse. The belly dance section was pretty bad and the two toning sections a total waste of time. Just not effective at all.
1,This film gives a very biased point of view. Scripture was taken out of it's biblical context, and any scripture that refuted the film's objectives were ignored, including the many that call sex outside of marriage a sin.	If you're looking for an honest, fair and balanced documentary, don't waste your time.
1,Some audio expresions from Robert Plant are missing on this dvd version	I notice that almost at the end of "The Song Remains The Same" track you don't hear a "come on, here we go" compared to the vhs, also at the middle of "Stairway to Heaven" there is another missing vocal bit when Robert repeats "wait a minute" for the second time...	Even at the end of the same track you can't find another line.	If you look for these discrepancies you will be amazed of how people dare to CHANGE MUSIC HISTORY during a remasterization process.	No one has the right to do that... I guess after all,	THE SONG DOESN'T REMAIN THE SAME.
1,I realize I must suspend disbelief some when I watch a movie but this movie was just too unbelievable even for a movie.  People in serious car wrecks and escape without a scratch, 3 men in a helicopter crash that destroyed the helicopter and they all walk away.  A guy doing precision shooting out of a bouncing helicopter. I couldn't even finish.  Goes to show that two great stars can make a lemon movie.
1,not so good
1,This review pertains only to the DVD special edition, which is a case study in how not to release an extended cut. The new cut of the film adds about an hour of footage, most of which are repetitive, ruin the continuity, have production problems, or disrupt the pacing. For example, pointless scenes of the original Sedgwick soldiers are included. Furthermore, there is no way to view the original theatrical cut of the film. There is no reason that the new scenes could not have been included separately in a "deleted scenes" section, or an option included to watch the original cut of the film.		Avoid the "special edition".
1,No stars!
1,Costner, as always, is good in this movie but the story is senseless and convoluted.  I wish I had the time back I gave to it!
1,This is somewhat of a hard film to measure because it is not bad, but it is not what it could have been. Vincent Price plays a wishy-washy wizard who is mourning the loss of his wife Lenore when he runs into Peter Lorre  who plays a drunken wizard who has been turned into a raven. Lorre informs  Price that he has seen his wife at the castle of  Dr. Scaribus (Boris  Karlof). Price and Lorre, along  with a young Jack Nicholson, set off to  confront Karlof.  This film tries hard to be a comedy with the trappings of  a horror film. This film has a great cast of horror veterens that is wasted  in a cornball comedy, but this cast also keeps this film from being a total  waste and they do make this film watchable. Karlof and Hazel Court are  ecspecially good in their roles as the heavies. This is probably the  weakest of Roger Corman's Poe films even though it boasts the best cast.
1,I'm giving the two stars for the part of the film I didn't watch.  Maybe it improved. The part I did see is whimsical only if that means lacking in imagination.  (I kept wondering what Tim Burton might have done with the idea.)  Creaky mechanics for bringing back Vincent weren't help by some amateurish acting.  Too often writers, filmmakers and the like seem to feel that getting across their message justifies totally abandoning logical devlopment.  This also happens here.		I have a friend who tries to watch any film that is about artists.  I could not recommend the film to him.
1,Had I been old enough to review "Airplane"  when it first came out, I know I would have raved on about how funny the film was. And, at that time and place (1980) it was funny to my then 14 year old mind. But, I'm commenting on the film now and I have to say it doesnt hold up well. Boring and stupid are the first words that come to mind. I realize that many people have a fondness for the film due to often spouted lines such as, "and don't call me Shirley." I tried to find it funny,  but not even a chuckle couldn't be mustered up. For me the only real humour in the film is Lloyd Bridges exclaiming, "looks like I picked the wrong day to quite sniffing glue." Comedy is a tricky business in films and some comedies produce seemingly never-ending laughs. This film is a nostalgic piece of 1970s comedy (since it came out in 80) that cements a unique approach to the genre onto celluloid , but without sustainability.
1,For many months, we've been allowing our tots to watch this movie (and other CGI-type "classics" like Toy Story I, Bugs Life, etc).  Of late, we realized, with horror, that our kids' recent aggression, and usage of snide and obnoxious remarks has been due to these "modern kids classics."---comments and demands like "WHERE'S MY FOOD!!!" (courtesy of "Bugs Life"); "YOU'RE STUPID!"; "YOU IDIOT" (Toy Story); "YOU STINK"....and the like.  Even the brilliant (for adults, that is) Monsters, Inc. has the characters castigating, berating, ridiculing each other (especially by the villain Randall, who viciously threatens and tries to Kill the protagonist at the end, snarling "STUPID" at him, etc).  Maybe "Finding Nemo" is the least objectionable of the bunch.  In retrospect, all the Disney movies in our collection are safe, tame, and benign by comparison, and far less objectionable if even at all.  (e.g., Cinderella, Little Mermaid, etc).  I wish we'd stuck to safer products for toddlers, like the afore-mentioned Disney titles, or The Wiggles, Baby Einstein, Bob the Builder, etc.  I choose politically correct but safe, over slyly entertaining and wickedly cutting-edge, any day!  Those "modern classics" are great for adults, what with their modern spin, dialogue, etc----but why give the kids a head-start on learning objectionable phrases and vocabulary that they're going to learn later from others? No one wants their kid to be the FIRST SOURCE of the poor habits and language being adopted by the other kids in the neighborhood and amongst the extended family.	The golden rule now in our house: If the adults enjoy it, and it's not tedious and boring, it's probably inappropriate for kids!
1,Save your money. What an absolute BOMB!!!
1,I still haven't finished the movie.  I got bored because the plot of the movie is very slow.  I have the 1959 version which I like a lot.  I can watch this version for only a few minutes at a time.  They should have not remade the movie.
1,ok
1,There was some disconnect in the story line. Not written well enough to deserve that cast!
1,So many questions here:  Why are the hospital corridors very dark and unstaffed at night; why does Jessica Alba get dreesed after a shower while still wet; why is Parker Posey in this movie?  There are no answers so save yourself the headache of trying to figure it out.  This is DUMB, not scary, uneven to the max and dull.  Must we remake every Japanese horror film?  Yet another question not worth thinking about in these days of completely uninspired, unoriginal filmaking.
1,I heard about this flick years ago but at the time it was an obscene cost to buy.	So finally I looked and found just 2 weeks ago. Wow what trash.	I don't know how anyone could be shocked or upset after watching.	The bodies were fake as hell. In no way looked real. Only one body that of a man with a Italian stash, but you will see no actual cutting was near this guy, just clever film cutting.	I was expecting awesome effects but this looks beyond trash. Maybe this was cool back in the 80's when the crap was filmed but this stands to be more of a joke than anything. Right down to the horrible dog at the start of this crap.	Even when he was humping the body, keep your hands to your sides and save the paper towles, if thats your kind of thing. Cuz it was so sexless and stupid. Her chest was open. It wasn't like he had sex with the woman. It was that of an open wound. Dumb.	Save your time.
1,I purchased the Chef based on the reviews that I read.  None of the reviews included "canned laughter" and had I known that, it would not have been a program I would have watched or a DVD that I would have bought. This is an AWFUL show! The actors are corny and in need of lessons, but if you enjoy a program with canned laughter, this is the show for you.  We love the BBC shows and have many of them but this was a real dud.
1,If I could give this zero stars I would. My daughter and I are huge fans of Broadway and musicals overall; this was perfectly horrid! The storyline was awful - what a disgrace to the novel. The acting was so bad we actually laughed throughout the video.  If this was billed as a comedy, I would have rated it quite high.
1,Hate it hute even give 1 star it's less
1,I just saw BOUNCE on cable.  While it starts out well enough (it begins so well that I decided to take a break from writing reviews on here), it somehow made me begin to lose interest after the first 40 minutes. The final half-hour was especially hard to sit through. I think that it's because of director Don Roos's lack of a cohesive narrative style. In the end, it just seems that the whole idea of this movie was to get Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow (who were famous for their on-again-off-again romance in real life) back together on the big screen. (...)	The crucial scene where Buddy (Affleck) and Abby (Paltrow) first meet is done so awkwardly: he arrives at her place of business, stands back to watch her take her Rottweiler out of the car to go inside her office, then approaches the front door and knocks, she comes out to greet him as a potential client, he interests her with a business offer, the dog who's locked in the bathroom barks loudly, she apologizes for that, he then makes a comment about Rottweilers, she freaks out because she hadn't mentioned that she had a Rottweiler (although the volume of the barking alone would've given that fact away), so now she things he's a stalker and as he tries to explain that he's not, she threatens to sic the dog after him, then accidentally opens the bathroom door a bit too much, the Rott then burts out and attacks him, tearing his suit-jacket and dress pants, after which he threatens to sue her till she apologizes profusely, and then they both spend the rest of the day talking outside the tailor's with the dog, who by now for some reason is totally docile.  This isn't a Meet Cute: it's a Meet Ridiculous!	So many similar opportunities for intelligent dialogue are missed throughout the movie. I'm not going to go into any further detail, as other reviewers have already done so, but I just wanted to express my disappoinment with the results of a system that greenlights sensationalism over substance.  Anybody who seriously thinks that this film would have been made without Ben & Gwyneth is seriously fooling themselves!	Ben Affleck has already proven himself to be a very good, natural actor (especially in SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE and GOOD WILL HUNTING) and Gwyneth Paltrow is nothing short of the Meryl Streep of her generation--but let's hope that if they ever co-headline another movie, they both carefully read the script first, as well as make sure they work with a director with more than a one-film resume` to his credit.
1,It takes a lot to make me give a one-star review, but this film has earned it.		First, in order to be capital A R T, the main character has to die in the end, otherwise it isn't.  This film is A R T.  Can't have anybody getting better in the end or getting it together!		Second, other than the main character dying (off stage of course, we can't have her die on stage, that would be melodrama)--other than that, in order for it to be A R T, nothing has to happen for the entire film.  This film is A R T.		It's challenging to make a film in which nothing happens, and Art-filmmaker wannabes work hard at it.  This one takes a more direct approach.  She has people sitting around taking drugs for 90 out of 94 minutes and mumbling incoherently.  How many different ways can you take drugs and stumble around and mumble?		Third, throw in background music that is also A R T--no, don't get me wrong!  Not classical music!  That isn't A R T !!!  This one makes sure you get that it's A R T by putting a loud high-pitched hum on the soundtrack for the first five minutes.  A R T -- get it?		Fourth, to make sure nobody is tempted to do some independent thinking, drop some names--Barthes, Derrida, etc.--that'll intimidate anybody.		And show some boring photographs and DARE anyone to say they're boring.		Oh, and that R rating?  And the nudity?  Gonzo!  This film is PG.  Or maybe PG-13 because of all the drug use.		In short, this film has absolutely nothing going for it.  If you want high value in this film, you'll have to supply it yourself.  Maybe you could invest in the acting--must take talent, after all, to stumble around and mumble incoherently, sway and roll your eyes.  Maybe you could come up with something else.  But you'll have to do it, because this film is not going to help you out.  It's up to you!
1,I have to say first of all that I enjoyed watching the film--as a fictionalized historical documentary, it works well. The scenery is amazing, the music (sounds, more like it) by Peter Gabriel is very nice, the camera work is good, and the acting decent, but there's really no story here at all. No characters change or learn anything, nobody learns any of the life lessons that drive fiction and drama. Things here just happen, one thing after another, like a plain narrative, and it leaves an empty feeling after the film is over.	The actors didn't have much to work with, it seems, and their performances show it--I agree with the reviewer who says that they seem to be caricatures. Almost all of the white people are prejudiced, unfeeling bigots, and all of the aborigines are subservient, passive people who depend on the handouts from the whites. I don't know if that's historically accurate, but it is somewhat painful to watch.	As a historical lesson about the depths to which people in power can sink when they're convinced of their own genetic "superiority," I would highly recommend this film. As a movie, a story that compels the viewer and helps us to learn more about life, I wouldn't recommend it at all--there's simply no story here.
1,Boring.
1,CANT RATE IT.. as it has not arrived yet.. wait till i get it before asking me to review it.
1,This lackluster comedy simply fails to deliver sufficient laughs per hour to justify spending the time to watch it.  Martin Lawrence, who is normally a funny guy, just isn't on his game in this flick.  Danny DeVito is better, but the material doesn't give him much with which to work.	There is a lot of talent wasted on stereotype bits that are more insulting than comical.  William Fichtner's flamingly effeminate detective would only be funny to homophobes.  John Leguizamo's Arab imitation is less humorous now than it might have been before September 11.	The only really funny bit in the film is a strictly visual gag by Stephanie Clayman as the sign language interpreter.  Without virtue of a solitary line of dialogue, she single handedly produces all the most hilarious moments in the film.	This film is a dud.  I rated it 3/10.  Martin Lawrence fans are likely to be disappointed.
1,backlash 2002 was just a bad ppv. i don't see why anybody would like this event. it just plain [disappointed]. the matches were slow and had [terrible] endings. but thi wasn't the worst ppv of the year. king of the ring was.
1,The fact that I got this movie as a gift from a coworker who couldn't finish it herself should have told me something...		So anyhow. Green Hornet is a modern updating of the classic pulp detective franchise, although it owes more to the TV show with Bruce Lee than the older properties. Left with tons of free time, poor self esteem, and a chip on his shoulder that nobody who owns a Bugatti should possess, newspaper heir Britt Ried (Seth Rogan) teams up with his boffin mechanic and barrista (this is a surprisingly big plot point) Kato (Jay Chou). Armed with a bulletproof car and the fighting skills of a movie Chinese guy (outstanding) and a doughy comedian (horrible) they wage a two-man war on crime, mostly for kicks. Cameron Diaz is there too but as in all of her movies, contributes nothing of meaning.		The film itself is a pretty inoffensive buddy action comedy, and I might have enjoyed it except for three things:	-Bizarre Benny-Hill style under-cranking used during practically any long cut	-Seth Rogan	-The writing (which is like 50% part of the Seth Rogan element)		The Benny Hill-vision is self explanatory so I'll jump to Rogan. He is, as always, horrible- a bleating frat boy with the voice of a muppet, zero comic timing, and surprisingly bad posture for a professional actor. Rogan waddles around the film talking over other actors, blurting humorless non-sequiters, and generally trying to evince the sort of "such an ass he's charming" ambiance as Vince Vaughn. Mr. Rogan, I have watched Vince Vaughn movies, and you are no Vince Vaughn. Chou is an exact opposite to Rogan, a blank slate with no personality save for a subtly murderous aggression. This is actually not unfaithful to Bruce Lee in many ways, but since Chou has very little screen presence and all his fights are wirework and CG, the emulation is incomplete at best. The writing is poor because there is far too much of it for this kind of film. Characters take long roundabout ways to say everything they say, awkward pauses go on so long they stop being funny and start seeming accidental, and the less said about the villain's interminable waxing on bad guy fashion the better.		There are doubtlessly people who will love this movie with all their hearts- the very easily impressed, for instance, who feel that the awful delivery of this movie's terrible dialog is actually clever, or the very old who are happy that there IS a Green Hornet movie then go to sleep five minutes in. But if you want the experience of past Green Hornet material, skip this pile. And if you just want a flashy movie based on pulp characters, Alec Baldwin's The Shadow or even Billy Zane's The Phantom (Slam Evil!) will both serve you better.		PROS	-There's a scene where Kato is making coffee and Jay Chou's stunt hands (apparently Mr. Chou cannot make espresso and couldn't be bothered to learn) show you how to make a sweet leaf pattern in the top with cream.	-The film ends at some point.		CONS	-Horrible acting and punishing dialog are murderous to endure.	-Seth Rogan is puppy-kicking unappealing and therefore a poor choice for the eponymous hero of the film.	-Kato's kung-fu sequences which should be a high point are instead silly music videos in which cables flail Mr. Chou at a bunch of stuntmen.	-You will guess every plot twist 120 minutes before it occurs. That's right, if you GUESS how the whole film goes right before you watch it, you will already know everything that happens.		THINGS TO WATCH FOR	-The late Mister Ried owns a car collection far in excess of what the owner of a single local paper could probably afford. Especially noteworthy is a scene in which Rogan systematically makes out with a party girl in every car in the garage, yet shies away from doing the deed in a Veyron. One assumes that there is simply no insurance that covers Seth Rogan defiling a 1.5 million dollar supercar (and wisely so).	-Kato goes overboard with the secret identity stuff. Like WAY overboard. His crime fighting car is hidden under and behind TWO OTHER PARKED CARS, a trick wall, and a hedge, and can still conceal all its weaponry. Note that he still gleefully wrecks it into cop cars and the environment at every opportunity.	-The villain has a trademark semi-automatic with two offset barrels. Neither seems to have an action of any kind, or a magazine. This is lampshaded when he mentions that it was "really hard to build."
1,Colin Firth should be ashamed to have wasted his talent in this ridiculous film.  Critics were right -- that Church mayhem/killing scene was outrageous.  Why I lasted that long indicates the utter lethargy this movie inspired.
1,This is about a hotel called The Tides in which case in the past a woman killed herself. Cut to the present where the woman is brought back as a vampire by a voice and a powerful presensce, because the voice wants her to get the deed and key and bring more people in so it can feed. But she falls for the Andy Garcia look a like, becomes his model and soon the guy falls for her and cant get her out of his head. It's an interesting premise and some of the directing is cool but by good this is an awful vampire movie. Christina Fulton is just to boring as the vampire chick, though hot, she is boring. Isaac Turner or Andy Garcia wannabe is just to constipated and that actor Leroy Jones, who played Zippo, looks like he could win an award for best Keith Richards impression. The person who did the voice talking to Fulton did a horrible job. Sounds like the guy was holding his breathe whilet talking. I admit I was very dissapointed because Vampire movies are what I love and this was just plain crap...this makes Van Helsing look like a masterpiece..just kidding because Van Helsing was horrible like this but this was even worser.
1,This movie was AWFUL.  I just watched it because I like Bruce Willis but it was AWFUL.  He must have made this movie because no one else asked him for anything else.  Don't waste your time.
1,I've been a huge Terry Pratchett fan for years and was thrilled to realize they'd come out with a live-action film. After the less-than-perfect animations, I'd been hoping actors could put a spin on the material that would not only follow the books faithfully (which all the films, animated and live do) but also capture that strange humor that makes the books so amazing. So I bought Hogfather back when it wasn't yet available for rent on region 2 just to see it. Did it perform as hoped?	Hmm. Not so much. I blame mostly the pacing. For some reason, and this applies to Colour of Magic too (though I'm praying not to the upcoming Going Postal that has a new director) the film just plods along from sequence to sequence with no feeling of continuity or punctuation. Also, Pratchett's hilarious lines and slapstick situations are based on a very solid connection to our own reality and without that recognition and bleed-through, the jokes are not very funny. Since they never explain the details of the Discworld, newcomers are left floating in uncertainty; no connection, no funny. Also, while I felt Susan was very well played and some of the other characters done well enough, the portrayal of Teatime as Johnny Depp's Willie Wonka--almost a direct rip-off--was so distracting and annoying I flinched everytime he was on screen. He's on screen a lot. He's only occasionally menacing and for a lead villian to be annoying instead of dangerous has a way of sapping the urgency out of a film.	That and the pacing. Geez, it dragged on. The sets and costumes are brilliant but many of the FX are super cheesy, reminding us this was made for TV. The slow strange timing of the script and editing made the cheesy extremely obvious as you sat there for a few seconds wondering what came after a line was delivered and nothing did but you staring at something that should've been shaved closer to the action. The action is...not exciting. Editing and pacing. Sucks. Same goes for Colour of Magic, by the way.
1,I watched only 10 min....terrible...don't waste your time...ZERO STARS!!
1,poor
1,I wonder what film the other reviewers saw that they garner with such praise, this is a dull 'thriller' that doesn't have anything new to	offer. It is lacking in terror, music or even atmosphere and anyone	with half a brain can guess already who the killer is. It isn't really	even a "giallo" type film because it lacks anything pertinent to that	type. Lenzi meanders from point A to point B fairly rapidly, minus the	chills one normally gets from any "creepy moments" or sustained plot.	He has the boring clichs to "inform" the audience (a news station, a	car radio, talking about the murders). A routine everyman (Sabato) is	uninspired in the lead role, how the killer never managed to kill him	or the dumb waif he is protecting is beyond intelligence. The film	lacks excitement and therefore it is only "average", just barely at	that even. And be prepared for the biggest let down when the killer is	exposed.
1,**1/2		"Alexander" is a handsome but clunky attempt to duplicate those sword-and-sandal epics of the past.  Although the screenplay gets many of the details of Alexander's biography right, the movie fails to being the character himself to life, thanks, primarily, to flat writing and a wooden performance by Colin Farrell, who turns the 4th Century B.C. Macedonian leader - who pretty much single-handedly changed the course of Western civilization - into little more than a whiny, teary-eyed mama's boy (and the actor they've chosen to portray Alex at 11 looks so much like little Mark Lester in "Oliver" that I half expected him to break out into a chorus of "Where Is Love?" before his part was over).  None of the other characters make much of an impact either, although Angelina Jolie, as Olympias, his scheming, diabolical mother, turns in a scenery-chewing performance that is at least fun to watch.  Anthony Hopkins brings his trademark pomposity to the role of Ptolemy, historian and narrator of the tale, lending an air of urbane pretentiousness to the film.		Almost the only thing of interest in the film is the surprisingly forthright way in which Stone deals with Alexander's long-recognized homosexuality, as reflected in his lifelong devotion to the pal of his youth, Hephaistion. Many filmmakers, aiming for the kind of mainstream audience a film of this budget and size demands, would have simply sidestepped the issue.  It's true that the one full-on sex scene is between Alexander and his Persian wife, but Stone at least leaves us with little doubt as to where Alexander's true inclinations lie.		For the most part, though, this is a surprisingly conventional and even conservative film for director Stone.  Missing are the human insights and fancy directorial flourishes we've come to expect from the maker of  "Platoon," "Born on the Fourth of July," "Nixon," and "JFK" (although the unsubstantiated conspiratorial ending reminds one of "JFK").  The dialogue is generally pedestrian and prosaic, and the story dawdles when it most needs to move on.  The battle scenes are fairly scanty and redundant, although the sight of a herd of elephants charging through the forest as part of an Indian army is definitely impressive.		At just a hair shy of three hours, the director's edition of "Alexander" is a mighty long haul indeed.
1,Boring.
1,This item as sold on Amazon as DVD and it is actually DVD-R. The disc would not play in my machine without skipping. The picture has been "matted" with black bars at the top and bottom to force the original 1.33:1 ratio to the modern 1.85:1 widescreen. Beware of Reel Classic Films products! I was forced to give this piece of junk one star. It does not deserve that high of a rating!
1,Slow and hard to follow
1,How many adventure movies of this type have heroes looking for a lost city in the jungle or a kings tomb buried under the sands of the Sahara Desert or an under water cave with riches beyond belief and when they find it, it begins to collaspe all around them and they have to flee for their lives. Well, this is another one of them and actually not a very good one of them. If I was restricted to review this movie with using only one word I would have to say "Boring".
1,Poor portrayal of Marines shaking in their boot with bombs and bullets flying around them.  If I was the producer of this movie I would go to the front lines in Afghanistan and watch how real Marines behave.  Too much camera shaking going on.  Hollywood needs to understand about this. Other than that it's the same old "bad aliens come to earth to conquer and kill humans" movie.  I've seen it before.
1,I got the none English version, did not turn out Good for Me.
1,I'm sorry, but I couldn't even get through the first episode.  So stupid and boring.  Who would want to watch a show like this?  Is society so lost that this is what they call entertainment?  Not educational, not funny, not even slightly interesting.  Just a waste of time.
1,not often dislike movies but this one sux
1,I really wanted to like this movie more and it was obvious the movie was trying to be be better than it was.  However, the movie was a little to drug friendly for my taste and beyond that, well it was a movie trying to be better than it was.  It is okay to watch but not a great or good movie.  The premise of the movie was good but the execution was poor.
1,This is the worst version of Batman that I have seen lo these many years. The villians are not themselves. And the lack of puns is lamentable. Disapointing.
1,Yes!! Finally...."This is the end" is what I said when the credits started to roll. Just not funny enough to deserve more than one star.
1,Usually I love S King but these except for Battleground are really rather ho-hum borrrring or just plain dumb.  I would give this one a pass and maybe shampoo the couch or watch the grass grow, which would be far more interesting.
1,Very strange movie!! Weird ending!!
1,Not great!
1,Other than George Smiley, I'm not really crazy about spies so I don't know why I got this. It was okay, though, until there was a brutal murder scene, completely unexpected although I don't know why since the victim was being held over a vat of boiling oil. They didn't even pull the camera away to leave the horror to the imagination.  I understand viewers in Britain called the station to complain about it.		There were some other unbelievable things going on, unbelievable as in "Where's your common sense, people?!"		So, not crazy about it.
1,its ok
1,Its one of the worst movies ive ever seen. Nothing remotley scary. Walk through your house at night with no lights. Thats 100 times scarier than this. This is boring as hell too. I love Elizabeth Olsen. Dont like her movies so much though. At least not yet. She was good in Godzilla for all the 10 minutes shes on screen. Lol skip this boring remake of a boring movie. The end really pissed me off. Only good thing imo- the blood coming from the urinals. Upside down.
1,It was slow moving, not anything to keep me intrigued or to keep watching. I love Ian and Noel but this just can't make the cut.
1,Some of the reviews of this movie are pretty wordy.  However, as Spinal Tap's album titled Shark Sandwich once got a two word review: "S**t Sandwich", I think the same applies here.  Unless you are doing some kind of thesis about the director Jesus Franco then there is no need to see this.
1,It was not for me and my wife didn't like it.
1,Not good at all
1,Bleh. Very very slow. Barely a story, more like a dream state fantasy. Kirsten Dunst takes it off, but nothing else really happens.
1,I guess this could have been worse. I mean, they probably didn't put much into it and I have seen bigger pieces of crap that obviously spent more money to be nothing. It isn't really confused about what it is. Kind of a waste of time but had some potential. Just kind of gets lost in a BS college love story and shallow characters (including a poor-man's jack black ripoff)
1,story about a dysfunctional mother/daughter relationship. mother is a drunken, irresponsible mess and daughter grows up fast; but in a good way.	She's intelligent, responsible and strong, instead of going the way of the mother, which is what one might expect.	The daughter is actually quite an admirable character.	Essentially:	car breaks down on a deserted road in the woods on way to the father.	auto repairman gets killed by forest creature feature.	EMT woman gets killed by forest creature feature.		the only good scene in the entire movie is when the daughter uses her smarts and devises a clever way to kill the forest creature.		no background is ever provided about the existence or origins of the creature, it simply exists conveniently courtesy of lazy scripting.
1,Watch this, if you want to see a woman, striving for independence, fall for an emotionally and a verbally abusive jerk.  This KDrama is dated and was apparently popular, in 2004.  The storyline, about mostly hearing an immature man/child verbally abuse a woman, over and over again, is draining.  Each episode was pretty much the same as the last one.  I'm amazed that this was even popular.
1,Another Disney film that strongly pushes their political agenda.
1,For some reason I thought it was the exhilarate DVD set, so I was disappointed I paid thirty bucks for one DVD in a clear (burnable) disc (that was cracked). Very disappointing, so I sent it back.
1,weird weird weird weird weird, need I say more
1,So boring I couldn't get past the first 8 minutes
1,Dumb
1,Very demeaning
1,I gave it 2 stars because the camerawork was high end with all its depth of field shots and still pensive shots, but it didn't seem to have a strong central driving character.		Alex seems to be the main subject, but I don't think there was enough of his story revealed.  Maybe more of his everyday struggles, and how he survived that school at his graduation.  He was a very frail boy and I could see how no matter what school he would go to, or even playing at the park after school, he would be a target.  His father was a clown expecting this weak kid, to take up arms against the bullies so that people would take him and his little sister seriously.  Really, dude?  You send your kid to school to let him fight alone?		The gay chick (why are we even focusing on this minor's fornication?) seemed like she had no real bullying problems like Alex.  Yes, the people are being small-minded in her public school, but her parents could just as easily homeschool her, or put her in good school versus the mediocre one she was in.		The black chick seemed to have the most compelling story, however there wasn't much of it in the film.  I would have liked them to go deeper on her progress especially since they made her a drug slave by putting her in an asylum and giving her drugs all day every day for months.		I wish the movie had more stats about bullying and bullying deaths from around the country and the world.  It seems to be more of a film to rally some young activists looking for something safe to combat or protest but there is not enough substance for my palate.
1,wouldn't watch it again
1,The spin off from the Mummy movies see's the Rock expanding his part of The Scorpion King. This time he is a good guy for some reason and is fighting some guy in egypt who has a British accent(?). He falls in love, has a Comic sidekick, conveniently named Comedic Sidekick. This name alone shows how little effort has been put into this cheeseball of a film. To get its low certificate we never see anyone get stabbed, we just get those annoying noises. Performances are terrible even Michael Clarke Duncan. With no CGI this really can't expect to stand up to The Mummy, but at least it had the guts to not use much CGI, or could they just not be bothered?
1,Didn't need to see explicit sex scenes to get the picture.  Otherwise the story was good.
1,not that good
1,The people in this dumb movie watch as everyone in the cabin disappears right before their eyes. Do they run away and try to save themselves ? NO ! They just remain in the cabin and sit and wait for their turn to disappear !  An extremely stupid movie !! Who in their right mind does this ?!
1,Horrible.
1,junk and useless film
1,It was good enough to watch, but not my kind of movie that's for sure!!!! Now, I remember why I didn't like it before much. Sweet November was a much better love story movie that Keanu Reeves was in. That's in my opinion!!
1,In reading some of these reviews, I wonder if we had seen the same movie.		Even if I did not have a degree in history, the terrible inaccuracies and inconsistencies would have been apparent to even a casual historical buff.  It is so bad I don't know where to begin.		Henry VIII came across as a blue collar worker who dutifully goes bowling every Saturday night.  There was not even a rudiment of royal aspect to this character; whether or not it was due to the terrible miscasting of the actor (one of many; more about that later) or a clueless director, one can only guess.  If I didn't know the main events and personages of this period, even a scorecard wouldn't have helped me understand what was going on.		Major historical events simply flew by without any rhyme, reason or explanation.  At least in some productions, actors are sought who bear some resemblance to the actual person.  In this case, an attempt to do so must have been thrown out the window.  Henry VIII was over 6 ft tall according to his skeleton unearthed in the 1800s.  In this movie almost everybody towers over him, in an age when most men were around 5'6"-5'8" in height.  And the rest--Wolsey, Cromwell, Cranmer--not one of the actors bore any recognizable resemblance at all to their historical personages, and in most cases were the exact opposites.  And why the crewcuts?		The personalities of Henry's wives were many and varied remarkably from one to the other.  This movie, however, took that fact of their differences in individual traits to a ludicrous extreme.  At times, they were downright incorrect.  Jane Seymour was way too overbearing, talkative and meddling.  In reality, Henry had been initially captivated by her because she was quiet and unassuming.  Catherine Howard was a promiscuous young girl, but I doubt she exhibited such sauciness in Henry's very presence.  Didn't anybody involved in this fiasco read a history book?		Skinny dipping in Tudor England?????????		I cannot finish this review without commenting on the total lack of  knowledge of the time period.  Didn't anyone know that women, especially those of the upper class, NEVER appeared in public without the sometimes elaborate headresses of the period?  The only exception would be when a woman was crowned; she would ride to her coronation with her hair loose.  Otherwise, women generally hid their tresses under headpieces and scarves.  I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the young Lady Mary in public without any head covering; likewise Catherine Howard.		What makes this especially disappointing is that usually the British are sticklers for historical accuracy.  Can someone tell me what happened with this movie?  Are they no longer teaching English History in the schools?		This sad movie is nothing but an elaborate soap opera set in Tudor England and altering the principles to such a degree that one had to guess whom they were portraying.		If you know very little about history, please do not use this movie as a starting point in your education.  As for those of us who have made an intense study of Tudor England--this film isn't even good enough for a laugh.  History massacred!  This production does not really even merit one star, but the scoring method does not give me the option of a "0".
1,Loved the first one but the second one the story was very weak....if you are a Star Trek fan maybe you got more out of it then I did. 2 stars
1,Not my type of comedy.
1,This review is about the version of A Boy & His Dog currently (March 2018) streaming on Amazon, not the movie itself. Two things you should know:		1. It's CROPPED from Scope widescreen (2.35:1) to matted (1.75:1). Only during the opening & closing credits is it presented in the proper aspect ratio.		2. Because of the cropping, the image is zoomed in more than it should be, which reveals what a muddy transfer this is. If you're watching on a laptop screen it might not be too noticeable; anything bigger than that & you're better off watching the blu-ray.
1,A lot of noise, cursing, violence and one- dimensional idiotic characters.  A real yawner.  If you need help falling asleep.
1,The main reason for the one star is because this movie was based on the Bible verses about the Rapture (as Christians call it).  It lured you into the movie using this story then they threw in the foursome sex scenes. It wasn't just the name of this movie, they tried make it look like what the Bible teaches about the subject.  So for those who were upset with my review with your comments, I say don't judge me for my morals and I will leave you to yours.
1,Not my kind of movie.
1,The critics panned this movie, but the premise interested me so much that I just had to see it.  I was largely disappointed.  Heather Graham was lovely and stylish as usual, and Robert Downey Jr. was wacky and weird as  usual, but that wasn't enough to carry the film.  The ending left me  thinking, "What was the point?"  This movie is not worth buying,  or even renting.
1,This is normally considered the best Godzilla movie among fans, but I don't know. Please don't hold it against me if you disagree with me, but I just found the whole enterprise kind of boring. Frankly, a nuclear message movie and a giant monster movie just don't mix. Likewise, it's too somber a movie. It just doesn't have the fun, silly elements that I see a Godzilla movie for. It takes itself too seriously. "Godzilla 2000" is my favorite of the series because it was constantly winking at its audience.	The DVD is about as good as you'd expect. There is a full frame version (1.33:1), and a widescreen version (1.37:1). The letterboxing is so modest it really doesn't matter which version you choose. The picture is about what you'd expect. Night scenes are murky and the picture is sometimes scratchy and sometimes clean. On the special features front, there is a collection of trailers (not the originals, unfortunately), an art gallery, a trivia game, and some hidden film facts and biographies on side one. On side two there is a sci-fi monsters documentary, which is basically a collection of theatrical trailers for movies from "War of the Worlds" and "The Day the Earth Stood Still" to "Robot Monster" and "The Giant Claw." It's not very professional, but it's enjoyable.
1,This is the old 70s version that sucks. Not the modern remake which is watchable. This is getting to be too common. We pay through the nose for a crap selection of movies and on top of it are misled ask over the place by false advertising. I'm getting sick of it.
1,Hated it boring!!!
1,The sometimes stellar acting cannot save this film from itself. I went in expecting something great, especially from all the hype that enveloped this movie during it's theatrical release. I was treated instead to a bland and pointless Catcher in the Rye rip-off that goes nowhere.	The movie strives to be great, and I kept expecting it to do something--anything--but fall flat. The worst part is that this should have been good; I wanted it to be a good film, as there's a real lack of stories of this nature. The only saving grace was the performance of Jeff Goldblum, and a few snatches of nice dialogue that are wasted on the end result. In contrast to other reviews, I didn't find Culkin's performance especially notable, either.	If you're looking for a story with a similar underlying theme, I suggest reading Salinger's novel.
1,It started out good but don't appreciate movies that are not 100% good, wholesome and clean and this was not.
1,Bad, bad, bad	Stupid,stupid,stupid	Cheeeeesy
1,just a tip that box set IS NOT worth it.  If you want all the movies> walmart has halloween 1 for $10, H-2, H-3 combo pack for i think $8.00 and then theres BEst bUY whom has H-4, H-5 for $15 ea.  Walmart just got in recently a NEW odd never seen b4 till recent a box set of Halloween 6, 7, 8 combo for $15.  Buy it if yur a hard  core fan.  Good $ price for 3 movies!!  Plus just about anywhere has the 2007 vs of halloween for about $20 i think.  so for bout $85  you can get all the Halloween movies if you got the $$$ and are a hard core fan!  SOOOO wish a produceers cut of  H=6 would come out. I heard its about 45min of additional footage that the theatrical release didn't show?? for whatever reason... SO there you go... AND another Halloween movie a sequal from last years (2007) will be out in 2009 i heard>?? who knows the more remakes and or ssequals they make there just ruining what few great halloween movies there are currently. If there going to make a sequal  make one w/ john(josh hartnett) lauries son coming back and facing michael one last time or something like that.  who knows what those joker producers will end up doing???
1,It was the same old thing over and over and over again...very tiresome.  I walked away from it and took a 20 minute break and came back and guess what, same old thing....freaks chasing freaks all over the desert trying to destroy each other. Weak plot and no real substance. If you're into spiked war-wagon-style souped-up vehicles blowing fire, explosions, and goons swinging on poles, then I guess this is for you.
1,it was too outdated for our enjoyment.
1,This movie is quirky and amusing, with Brooks reacting to some funny things in the afterlife (like being able to eat as much as he likes and visiting a horrible comedy club); but the trial scenes weigh the film down.  The afterlife as envisioned by Brooks has adopted an Oprah Winfrey type of personal growth program where people are judged primarily on how smart they have become and whether they have overcome their fears.  It would have been nice if Brooks had satirized those ideas more.  I think he sort of did with the "past life pavilion," scene, but ultimately this movie takes the new age philosophy too seriously.  I would have liked it more if Brooks and Streep had organized a prison break and found someplace else to go besides Judgement City.
1,I'm a hugh fan of the Doc Martin series - Have watched all four seasons and am eagerly awaiting season 5.  In the meantime, I purchased "Doc Martin, The Movies" because of my interest in understanding how the PBS series came to be.  Unfortunately, the first disc in the 2 disc set was defective and resulted in a return.  The second disc was fine and so all was not lost but I did so want to see that first movie.
1,Disturbing cult movie - diabolical evil vs good?
1,PLEASE BEWARE PEOPLE. There are companies selling videos in the United  States from Europe and those videos sold can not be played on DVD players sold in the United States. So you end up with a worthless to you DVD,  that you can only see if you take it along  with you on a vacation to the European continent.  And as for the return policy it is o long tedious one.  I caution you too look very carefully when purchasing DVDs  from Amazon the depiction of these companies are NOT  distinctly  apparent it is somewhat shrouded,  look carefully.
1,William Grefe: the name is synonymous with "horribly made movies." This little gem from 1976 cashes in on the "Jaws" craze with perhaps the most ridiculous concept in fish movies ever: a psychic hero who communes with the sharks telepathically (somehow via a necklace obtained on Mindanao during a "shark god" ceremony, in a subplot that involved much running through a jungle) and defends his toothy friends. Well, really not so toothy, actually. The movie uses Nurse Sharks (Ginglymostoma cirratum); large, sluggish sharks, which although they do have teeth, are generally harmless unless provoked. You can spot the Nurse Sharks by looking for the wide head with pronounced barbels (thin, whisker-looking organs in front of the nostrils that are used for sensing touch and taste). End of ichthyology lesson.		Back to the film: this poorly made rip-off contains some of the worst acting and screenwriting in memory, another signature of a Grefe production. The hero (Richard Jaeckel) grimaces through the movie like Mod-Hair Ken in need of Imodium AD. He takes his fish extremely seriously, and becomes a one man shark-feeding machine, placing anyone who crosses his path into the gums of his nurse shark friends. The leading lady is Jennifer Bishop, who may be the worst actress I have ever seen, and wears more eye makeup than Tura Satana. Her aquatic dance scenes are so exciting I believe I may have dozed off during the bulk of them, except during her brief tango with Sam the shark. Her husband, only slightly more overweight than Mr. Creosote, and unfortunately spending much of the film in shorts, is the evil villain, and is very scary (if you happen to be scared of a 500 pound Weeble.)		There is also a subplot about a hurricane. I was left completely stumped by how that in any way furthered the film. There is also a demonstration of why you shouldn't go shark fishing in a tam o'shanter.		I have seen "Piranha," and had previously considered it to be the worst fish movie I had ever seen, trailed very closely by "Jaws 3-D," but no more: this is it, the champion all-time worst fish movie I have ever seen, or ever hope to see. It is pure and classic Grefe.
1,I bought this thinking that this would be a really challenging disc. It is not. The instructor is not a native English speaker, and I find her voice annoying. But all this would not matter if only the routine were interesting. The poses are slow in coming and held for a long time. I kept on thinking, "Ok. Now we finished the warm-up. The interesting, challenging sequence is about to start." But it never did. Nice scenery in the woods though. And the music is the same as Maril Hadidi's which is execellent.
1,video quality was very good	dont like documentary movies	thought it was a actual movie was mislead into purchase	product
1,Previous DVDs to come out on DVD have had the Game almost Complete,	They have had either the international feed of play by play or as in the case of the Tampa Bay Bucs, they used the Radio calls of the teams along with the actual video.	So this is a huge disapointment, I am lucky to have the game recorded on a DVD recorder,	As far as the rest of the fetures on the DVD I would give them 5 Stars,	But without the game on it I can only give it 2 stars
1,It's better Greta Garbo's Version
1,Yes, even you can write a screenplay! All you need is one page of dialogue in 99 pages of "he walked slowly down the aisle, his shoes clicking on the tile," and "long shot of killer standing alone in an alley." Pitty Macdonald for wasting her talent in this tripe. She barely says ten lines of dialogue. Art should be more meaningful than life, not less so.
1,The actors were obviously way out of date ... last MIB was a decade ago and age has caught up with both actors.  I'm glad I rented instead of buying.
1,Did not watch it sorry
1,Is the market for Straight Supremacist Crypto Conspiracy Gay Bashers just not being served well enough?		Why else is this antiquated hate crime still being offered as a gay film?	Because it shows nudity? Buy a spank book for crying out loud. Or pick up something wholesome like Pasolini's&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Sal-or-the-120-Days-of-Sodom-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B005D0RDO8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Sal, or the 120 Days of Sodom (The Criterion Collection)</a>&nbsp;instead, but don't reward this hateful depiction of gays as power-mad pedophiles with your attention.		--Spoiler Alert BEGINS--		Ever hear how a gay agenda exists to recruit young people and convert them into homosexuals? More insidious than the Protocols of Zion! How about the secret brunch of powerful queens that controls Hollywood? A villainy more octopussy than the Illuminati!		The Everlasting Secret Family is just such a cabal with just that purpose. Unlike in&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Skulls/dp/B002DJV9VU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Skulls</a>, though, these recruits are bound for sex with their mentors. So, a dynasty of whoremasters as well. It's as if Bob Jones University bought the rights to Falconcrest to release an infomercial for Ex Gay Ministries. It makes seem quaint such propaganda of previous pograms as claims of drinking baby's blood or flying on brooms. Or showing these subversive homos to be eternal just like the soulless, decadent DorIan Grey (or Dracula, for that matter.)		--Spoiler Alert ENDS--		Conclusion: Seeing a few bare bums is no reason for tolerating this Victorian sickbed of repressed feelings and brandished self-loathing. So please subtract at least 2 stars from my rating above to get a fair estimation of how disgusted you'll feel with yourself  if you make yourself party to this.
1,Typical Zombie movie that adds nothing original to genre.
1,Well after 41 minuets one should want to know why the newsman was on a hit list. And this movie got 4 stars?. If a hit team was worth	their salt they'd have killed the target...	From now on I will avoid a Michael Madsen films...Ad nauseum...
1,I would give 2.5 stars if I could. Cute story, does try to be Gross Pointe Blank, but fails because the actors aren't great. Very attractive! Just not great. If you are bored and need to fill the time with something cute, then watch this movie.
1,When an American film is based on a dumb idea, this is plain from the start.  When a French film is based on a dumb idea, one thinks that perhaps one is missing its deeper meaning and the film will improve.  "Romance" is from that genre of French films based on dumb and pretentious ideas of Jean-Paul Sartre: we are what we do, we define ourselves by our actions, our freedom is our essence.  Misunderstanding Sartre has produced a deluge of idiotic French cinema in which unbelievable characters behave in bizarre and unsympathetic ways uttering nonsensical dialogue that conveys no coherent inner life or motivation but are animated instead by abstract metaphysical notions and ideology.		One can hear Marie (Caroline Ducey) philosophize her inner thoughts of sexual degradation but unlike the blurb on the cover "Genius! Possibly the sexiest movie ever made!" they are entirely unerotic, hard to watch, and laughable because even when attached to scenes in which the characters are really doing it on screen they reflect nothing like sexual passion for anyone who has ever had it.  I would not have watched it for free and regret paying $10 for it on Amazon (bought through a friend's Prime membership).
1,Supposedly motivated by suspense horror, this film is based upon a man's memory of his past childhood which became more true than he would let his conscience believe. Tim (Barry Watson) confronts his past in order to relieve his present stance of the memory that burdens him daily as he pursues to live a normal person's life.		Taking the advice of his girlfriend and a woman whom he knew as a younger boy after the incident, he journeys back into the old house which he tries to forget. During his stay there, he not only found out the truths of the myth of the Boogeyman (Andrew Glover), his past has also been reintroduced into his life and plays back in his mind like a film he thought he had forgotten and put aside long ago.		Through all the mystery he comes upon the truth of his childhood which haunted him so, about his Dad's death that very night as he was a little boy. He also came upon the truth of the missing children and the old man who tried to capture the Boogeyman himself, single-handedly.		Like I said, a suspense-filled film. The disappointment came with the single fact that the movie failed miserably at the end, like an old horror flick from the 80s. The Boogeyman himself wasn't as well thought out as one would hope and being a big factor, the role of the boogeyman should be more dramatic and significiant than what it is in this movie. Even though a disappointing movie, it is still "alright" and not a horrible and total disappointment of a film. The myth of the boogeyman therefore is shamed by this movie.
1,This movie was a big let-down. I LOVED the first two Mummy movies in the series and could watch them over and over. This one was written so bad that the lines could be laughed at throughout the entire thing (and I don't mean the comedic lines). The wife is a different person and is awful, son talks like John Wayne and is too old compared to the years that went by, and Jet Li was barely in the movie/had any lines. The special effects in this movie were mediocre in 1995 and that's saying something. The story of it completely broke off from what it was in the first two. The wife has no connection to her past like in the second one whatsoever. I would not recommend this to anyone that loves the first two. If you don't want to ruin the series and have not seen this movie, then don't even think about watching this. I have never been so disappointed in a movie.
1,Beware that Universal is out to fleece fans of "Columbo".  I have seasons 1-5 and seasons 2-5 are cheaply produced. No frills, no extras. Just the episodes. You will also see characters later in an episode that you should have met earlier, but that meeting is cut out. There is the classic episode with Janet Leigh in which she and her butler are beating on the door of the bedroom where her husband lies dead. However, they never enter the room, that part is cut out. The scene cuts to the arrival of homocide detective Columbo...with no dead body in sight yet because it was cut out. Universal also did this with the classic Burt Lancaster Western "Valdez is Coming" in which they cut out nearly 20 minutes.  The series guest stars are a who's who of a Hollywood long passed. You will see Janet Leigh, Jack Cassidy, John Payne, Forrest Tucker, Dick Van Dyke, William Shatner, Robert Culp and so many more great old stars. But...be warned...Universal is all about getting your money out of your pocket and into their hands. They could care less what they give you in return. The Columbo episodes they have released as "complete and uncut" are actually syndication cut episodes. I contacted Universal, the FTC, and several other governmental consumer protection departments; no one cares what the giant Universal releases.	This show is worth so much more than the cheap treatment it is being given by Universal.  The price for the set is still as high priced as most of the other shows being offered season by season, yet it is produced terribly 'on the cheap'.  Reason? Because the studio knows it can get by with it.
1,Rush is always Rush but this blue ray for me doesn't has song quality
1,The DVD is completely un-viewable. Zero Star. It should not have been sold at all.		The picture is always in zoom mode. As a result, I could see only the faces of the actors when they're fighting or shooting! The picture is blurry. The sound is noisy. I could hardly hear them talking.		I felt I was cheated.
1,A mysterious manipulation, but certainly not a passionate affair.
1,Sadly the producer must think that the F-word used every other word makes the movie funny and entertaining.	Don't waste your time or money on this movie
1,Very weird, slow movie with very little to do with Turing
1,Ending was truly sucked to the point of wanting to sue the people involved in making this.
1,I thought I was getting much more from this dvd set. I paid $40 but now you can get it new for about $33. thats a lot better but still not all that boxset. It's big and only comes with 3 dvds. If you want the Blueray that maybe its a good deal but if not, don't touch it. I thought it would slide in different parts to reveal the dvds, it just opens up to two parts with the dvds in the middle "not that cool." I would buy the special hellraiser dvds that just came out and look for a puzzle box online if you really want a hellraiser puzzlebox. I found some puzzle boxes a lot more detailed than this big flop.
1,Scott Eastwood looks just like his dad and does a good job as our protagonist/antagonist and the beautiful scenery and acting of both Walter Goggins and Danny Glover add some much needed luster to an otherwise lackluster film.
1,It was difficult to accept George Clooney in the role of a dumb redneck criminal. It seemed any moment he would say "ok all, I am just doing a poor imitation of a dumb redneck."
1,Omg, what a hot mess of a movie. Plot stupid, dialogue slipshod, the professionals phoned in their performances, and the non professionals, which should include Mrs. Duvall were stilted and wooden. She is a striking looking woman and looks great on a horse, but she couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. Most of the movie rentals are so cheap that it is rare that I regret spending the money on a couple hours of entertainment but I sure do regret this one. Mostly sad to see an actor of Robert Duvall's stature at the helm of this wreck of a movie.
1,This movie was all over the place.  It attempted to blend the story of survivors with that of a military group protecting a research facility with little success.  There was exploration of loss, effects of massive trauma/change on survivors and the exploration of relationships in a post-apocalyptic world in a not so clear or substantive manner.  The story jumped from one story line to the next never reconciling them.  There were elements that were interesting, such as the vaccine that potentially could slow the spread of the infection and the cannibals.  Unfortunately, there was this heavy focus on folks too stupid to pay attention during the zombie apocalypse.  And, how did that bottle of wine last so long?
1,hot mess
1,The recording of film is extremely poor. Its hard to make out the people, makes me thing twice before ordering again.
1,Lousy, waste of film and time!
1,I saw that Season 3 of Weeds had come out recently, and was tempted to purchase it as I had thoroughly enjoyed Seasons 1 and 2.  However, since I own way too many DVDs that I will never watch again, I opted to be patient and Netflix it instead.  I'm so glad I didn't buy this, as it will never get a repeated viewing from me.		There was an excellent cliff-hanger at the end of Season Two, although if the truth be told, even by that point things were getting a little too crazy in the show (but I was still left completely engaged).  After the first couple of episodes of Season 3, however, I started to get a sinking feeling.  It turned into a show about gangsters and thugs, and was a far cry from the 'soccer Mom who deals pot in suburbia' that the series began as.  Sure, there are still some funny parts, and I guess they were enough to make me get through the Season (but just barely), but even Doug and Andy's antics became a little too unbearable and ridiculous to fully enjoy.  There are so many plot twists that simply don't make sense, and many subplots that don't go anywhere and have no place in the series (what the heck did Andy's stint in the Army have to do with ANYTHING?).  Issues get 'resolved' in the most ludicrous ways; it almost feels like the writers want the show to be dumb.  I feel the show 'jumps the shark' a million times and becomes too unrealistic to take seriously.  As another reviewer stated, sometimes the show feels almost 'cartoony'.		I was glad after the last episode was done.  It was a hard watch, but for some reason I felt I had to see it through until the end.  For me the season finale felt like it wrapped the entire series up, and I don't care where Nancy goes now that Agrestic is up in flames.  I am done with Weeds, and I will not watch Season 4.  It's really a shame to know that a series that started off so strong sunk so low.  But this seems to be the trend all too often.		As for the DVD quality itself, of course the picture and sound are excellent.  I can't comment on commentaries or other special features, as I had no interest in watching/listening to them.
1,Really poor plot and equally poor acting.		I rented this because of all the hoopla about the new movie but wanted to turn it off several times and was really disappointed with the ending.		Some moves are just laborious -  they go way too far to make minor points in the plot. They waste scenes trying to lead you by the nose to make an obvious point.		This is one of those movies.
1,slow not a grab you movie spader was still cool like he is on blacklist
1,Didn't finish
1,I'm rather keen on short stories on film however, this collection was more than disappointing. I recall freshman year english class at university having to submit several drafts of a short story assignment in order to earn an A. I don't think this director has a clue what a short story is. The film is nothing more than a collection of Ideas, at best events. As for the "gay in America claim", no... the ideas presented transcend borders.
1,First of all, I love Donnie Yen. The man is talented enough to have convincingly stood up against Jet Li in 'Hero', and he has the ability to hold a staring role.		Second, 'Kill Zone' is a horrible movie. It's strange how such a simple premise as "cops investigate mob boss" can be executed so poorly in this day-and-age. The main issue is that the protagonists are all horrible people. They falsify evidence, beat witnesses to support their claims, murder suspects, steal money, and love every second of it. And rather than being antiheros, we're meant to believe that these are our noble heroes		Sammo Hung's character is far more interesting and compassionate, and his story of juggling his life as a brutal mafioso with his wife and newborn son is by far the best part of the movie.		However, what everyone wants to see is Donnie Yen. Well, he isn't in it. About 20 minutes in, Donnie just comes out of nowhere to join the team, and then all but vanishes until a little over the hour mark. His fights are very good, and are iconic of his style, but there are only a grand total of four in the whole movie, and only two that are more than 30 seconds long. Really, just look up the fight clips on the internet, and avoid this horribly cliched and botched movie.
1,I'll keep this review simple since there are already so many reviews for this DVD: 1) Most poses consist of a lot of stretching, which were not satisfying. 2) The entire dvd is very long, almost an hour. After following this video once, I never want to do it again.
1,Slow moving and just a dumb movie. Couldn't finish watching and that's too bad because it had some great actors, but it just didn't flow.
1,Um...that's it for 2:30 min.	Acting is pretty bad.	Dialogue is pretty bad.	Special effects....pretty good.	Save your cash and more importantly YOUR TIME.
1,After 30 min. we stopped watching.  It just did not interest us.
1,too bizzare for my taste.  not really sure what the point of the story was.  the filming was as bizzare as the story, made me dizzy watching.
1,Cheap, horrible, not worth my time to comment.
1,After a few minutes into the film you knew what the ending would be. This story could have been told in a much better way!
1,This is so incredibly bad! I can't believe Tom Six chose to make an appearance in the worst of the series. There's no way to express how wrong this is. I thought the first HC was outrageous, a sort of variation on David Cronenberg's excellent "new flesh" films of the seventies and eighties. Then number two was repulsive in all the right ways, actually approached "Eraserhead" arthouse meets midnight movie status. Even the black and white worked well although I would like to see HC2 in color; It looked seriously queasy enough  in B/W. The main problem with HC3 is Dieter Laser. He is so over the top he ruins the film. It was interesting having the two leads from the first two together in a whole different story but what was Six thinking with Laser's performance? Laser was perfect for the first film but here he comes across like a drunk and pissed off OLD Klaus Kinski mixed with a drunk and pissed off OLD Hunter Thompson! What's worse, he's becomes boring after a few minutes and he weighs the film down, you'll want him off the screen ASAP. One interesting aside, I went into this blind to the cast. When Governor Hughes makes an intro I kept thing this guy looks familiar. I was pretty surprised to see it was Eric Roberts. He certainly has changed... I'll always think of him in his best roles - Paul Schneider in Bob Fosse's "Star 80" and opposite Jon Voight in "Runaway Train". He was probably the best thing about this film. Hopefully Six will have a change of heart, admit it was a VERY bad joke and give the fans of the first two flicks a better ending to this saga. The concept is truly horrifying as a unique twist on traditional "mad doctor" genre mixed with modern shock horror. The Dutch let me down I guess it's off to France in the meantime... until American horror grows a set again and remembers how to use 'em. It seems everybody in the world is continuing the great American Grindhouse (original "Texas Chainsaw", original "Dawn of the Dead", "Original "Last House on the Left", "Deranged", etc.) except the folks who started it.
1,This is a pathetic excuse of a movie I manages to insult cinema and gamers at the same time I suggest if you like gaming or have any memories or nostalgia at all then don't watch this trash.
1,I'm a fan of fun, bad sci fi - but this was just bad, and not fun enough. Harvey's character was terribly written - I felt sorry for the great actors involved. No mythology or back story, not enough science, not enough character, not enough emotion. Just don't.
1,This has to be the worst movie ever!!  I thought it was a joke, but it stated at the beginning and towards the end to remember "this is s true story".  Who put these idiots on this planet...  it was like a dumb and dumber, but real.  I cannot believe I watched the whole thing!!
1,As you know, `Aeon Flux' has been either ignored or dismissed as nonsense by the critics, and its results on the US box-office are certainly not what the producers would have expected them to be. So here is a question: Is this so bad? If bad, how bad?		I finally saw the film, and at first I thought these critics were wrong. The earlier chapters, in which heroine Aeon Flux appears as ninja-like deadly assassin, are full of rip-roaring sequences that are fun to see, and there are many good ideas in them such as the deadly turf. Though I have not seen the original MTV series, I thought Charlize Theron (and her black costumes, if not her hairstyle) brings life to the thin story that betrays its origin.		But sadly `Aeon Flux' loses steam too soon, after she encounters the target Trevor (Marton Csokas) the leader of this futuristic, totalitarian society. Except for the secrets surrounding Trevor and Aeon, the film has little to tell, and that little is not very interesting. The film also has Aeon's sister Una (Amelia Warner), Aeon's partner Sithandra (Sophie Okonedo), but their characters have not much to do in the story. Even two veterans such as Frances McDormand and Pete Postlethwaite are buries in the CGI-created halo and the heavy make-up.		But if only there are healthy amount of good actions, every flaw would be forgiven. Sorry, but Karyn Kusama, who directed acclaimed `Girlfight' five years ago, may not be the right choice after all, for she fails to keep the film's good pace in the second half, slackening it with dull and uninspired actions. The concluding part is very disappointing, nothing that you have seen in sci-fi better actions like `Equilibrium.'		Now I checked out the informative site of Rotten Tomatoes, and found that as many as four critics cited the name of `Catwoman' in order to mercilessly ridicule `Aeon Flux.' The unkind comparison is understandable. These two films both contain talented (and safe to say beautiful) Oscar-winners; both have one strong woman in its central role; and both define the meaning of `stylish action' in a quite unique way. Add to them `Tomb Raider' if you like and what can you have? Three Oscar winners and three very good-looking posters.
1,Fair, but dragged in spots
1,Saw this in the theater. Loved it. After reading it is split up and the trailers are gone, won't buy it. Whoever is responsible for this decision is stupid. I looked forward to seeing this again in its original form on DVD and this is what they do. I'm not interested in the extra scenes. I'm interested in seeing this the way it was in the theater, i.e. two movies, fake trailers. I don't know why this flopped in theaters because it was great in its original format, but I hope these dual DVD releases sans fake trailers fail miserably. This was a bad, bad decision. I'm very disappointed.
1,It's not complete. No way is it complete!
1,It's a bunch of 30-40 year olds with sagging skin pretending to get it on.  Nothing erotic here.  Not even funny acting.  Do yourself a favor and check out Misty Mundae for some great erotic/funny movies.
1,Entertaining.
1,Couldnt watch it region code.
1,The plot is amazingly shallow, simple-minded and predictable. The acting is no better. The location settings in China, however, are  beautifully filmed.
1,Just being about the vibe of the movie - I expected more after all the great reviews and the hype.  It was just an ok movie.  Not too boring, but not enough action and suspense.  I just didn't get a feel of excitement from it.
1,returned
1,I bought these singly for $5.00 a piece from a bargain bin. They simply are unwatchable. Do not waste your money on these DVDs from Delta or Laserlight. They are complete garbage!
1,This movie is terrible. I could only watch 30 minutes of it.
1,i wanted this to be good but could not make it beyond the first 30 min.  if you watched the trailer you've seen the best of this movie.  corny awkward and painful too watch.  the male leads are metro, the scientists are nerdy, the dialogue is strained and manufactured . . . . but  . . . .the pet bull dog the killer soldiers kept on base was the cutest most adorable thing you have seen all daaaay!
1,There are two main tendencies in analyzing the picture. One group of reviewers says there is nothing in Mulholland Drive besides the director's whimsiness, overindulgence and the apparent lack of ideas - the trait that all the artsy/noirish vagueness fails to camouflage. The more enthusiastic viewers willfully abstain from any analysis of the film at all, calling it "impossible to comprehend", "intentionally irrational", "a dark meditation on the evilness of Hollywood" and "a surrealist dreamscape". And of course there are some people who exit a multiplex cursing or shrugging, regretting the time and money spent, common Joes and Janes with the plans of a nice Saturday night movie thwarted.	I'm happy for the "incomprehensible masterpiece" crowd - they'll get value for money. These are the people who like to think they can transcend their basically mainstream preferences and like to see from time to time "something with a twist", provided a couple of media gurus certify it's Art. They buy and proudly display Salvador Dali's albums, fascinated by the well-drawn realistic objects and figures in the funny combinations. That's all it takes for them to feel they are the advanced consumers of Art - something kitschy and conventional shredded, mixed, put together at random and lacquered with the gloss de jour.	But these who think Mr. Lynch is just having a good time messing with his mind and camera totally disregarding the plebeian preferences are not right, I think. He is acutely aware of his obligations. He must be amused watching the acolytes catalogizing all the droppings of the director's prolific imagination - the Dwarf, the Cowboy, the dark blue cube - attributing the meaning(s) to every nonsensical item Mr. Lynch throws in.	But he is not just taking, he's giving what he thinks his quasi-sophisticated clientele likes and needs. As much as they are fascinated with the blonde's and brunette's purpose(less/ful) fumblings the bonus of the soft-porno action is very welcome, the urge to see the ladies' mammae revealed is the lowest common denominator of every male from ultimately highbrow to the utterly proletarian. The leading characters MUST have an intercourse as the a film progresses - regardless of their sex - and the maestro is happy to oblige with the most gratuitous sex scenes in the recent cinema - with the dark seductress sporting the implanted frontal bounty worthy of any XXX starlet.	And the good old uaghaha is also a must to keep the audience entertained and grateful. It's hard to consciously "enjoy" the film's "artsiness" for such a long duration - so the comic relief comes in time, we see the slapstick Tarantinoid eccentrics of the hilarious hitman, stinging the fat lady's behind with a bullet, making funny for the fans' benefit, giving the break from the grateful scanning of the "surrealist dreamscape".	These who seek will find. The "meaning" is here spruced with a nice little bonuses that make 2  hours of experiencing "art cinema" endurable. Take the subdued pain of watching pretentious nonsense and gain the feeling of being "in".	I'm a bit surprised there is only one David Lynch in the USA - the country where all kinds of do-it-yourself are very popular. Is it so difficult to make a collage of the conventional scenes, putting the end before the beginning, making the characters search fervently not for million dollars or a small blue key but the tiny taxidermist's glass eye that can open the doors to another universe, easily? Then brunette is suddenly seen with the blond Afro hairstyle and has a different name and her former female lover wears a man's suit and talks in basso, the slimy spiked monster springs at the weirdo's face from the diner's paper cup - not from around the corner, Cowboy is replaced by the menacing Fireman in glass shoes or the grossly oversize Boy Scout with red beard and the small pet rhinoceros with poisoned horn. All this circus interacts to the pompous music composed by someone with a pompous Italian name. And everything must be soaked wet in the darkness, to be very noir - i.e moody and "meaningful", meditative.	Then the show opens to the satisfied grunts of these who prefer "to experience, not to understand", to look in your next offering for a new glimpse of the trademark Mean Fireman, Bearded Boy Scout and the blonde with enormous Afro riding the blue rhino to the mystic interworld portal in the McDonald's toilet.
1,As a fan who has watched the show from the beginning and has loved it all along, I must say that this film was overall a disappointment.		But let me start with some positives.  The production values of the film were awesome, and I loved the location filming in the mountains.  The photography in this was quite beautifully done.  And the actors did magnificent as always.  I also liked the elements of the story involving Tomin and his facing the actions he took as an Ori soldier, with Teal'c being the one most interested in and capable of helping him through it.  This also gave Christopher Judge a chance to really show his dramatic acting capabilities, when most of the time his role is based more on physicality.		But beyond that, I thought that the film had three major flaws that detracted from the quality and enjoyability of the film.  One-the whole plot device of the Ark of Truth was an overly simplistic solution to the Ori problem.  Open a box, let a Prior see it, and all the Ori followers will see the error of their ways and be nice from now on.  Come on!!  I know that they had to come up with some kind of simplified solution to the Ori problem because they didn't have a whole season to wrap the story, but this was a just plain stupid idea!		Two-bringing back the replicators!!  As soon as I saw that metallic bug, I hung my head and went "Argh, give me a (bleeping) break!"  The replicators were a lot of fun for a villain back when they were first introduced, but at this point, they have just gotten old!  I'm sick of them!  They've almost become an excuse for them to bring out big guns with really big ammo magazines so they can show a plethera of clips of really loud guns being fired by really cool looking dudes!  They could've thrown in Jean Claude Van Damm and made this a B action film.  I think if they had focused on the Ori story instead of devoting a full third of the film to the replicators, the film might have been much better served!  Instead, I felt like I had seen all of the replicator stuff before.  Of course, I had, in Seasons 4, 5, 6, 7, and a whole lot in Season 8!		Third-the replicator element brings us to the final problem I had with this film-Replicator Man!  At least, that's what I like to call the replicator-controlled zombie that Colonel Mitchell fights.  Through this whole sequence, I thought I was watching some cheesy zombie film mixed in with a little action-movie style fight scenes.  Replicator Man was a stupid enough plot device on its own, but then the sequence dragged on and on and on.  Only Ben Browder's whit in between the punches kept me even partially interested.		As I said, disappointing film overall that had some good points, but was rather poorly executed in terms of writing and plot.  Here's hoping for something better with Continuum.
1,I believe it is morbid and shameful that just for financial gain and sensationalism a movie about a women who apparently was ignored in life should now be paraded in such a way.  Oh, and by the way I did not finish it.
1,None of these are Laurel and Hardy films and all of them are so bad that no one bothered to renew the copyrights on them. Most of these were made before they were a team, and the rest are guest appearances they should have avoided. For die-hard fans ONLY - and even they might regret the purchase.
1,I  did not like this at all, and turned it off in the middle of it it did not make much sense to me at all.it is probably me!
1,So I was really happy to see this set come out with both the film and TV version all in one set. I already own the Universal Halloween 2 release on blu-ray that came out a few months back.		I was SHOCKED when I opened this blu-ray and found 2 discs. The Movie version is on blu-ray. HOWEVER.... The TV version is on DVD. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? So I am really only buying this version to get the TV version on blu-ray and I get a DVD.		DO NOT BUY THIS if you are expected to get both versions on Blu-ray.		For the price tag I have to say I have been totally ripped off and scammed by Shout Factory. NO WHERE does it say on the box is the TV version on DVD at all. If you buy a Blu-ray you expect to get the film on BLU-RAY!
1,Movie of course is a classic. However, this widescreen version is so-so. Picture not improved and just seem to be watching it in a zoom mode. Not letterbox version.
1,The plot in this film is weak and unexciting. I expected a lot more because of who was in the film. If you're looking for real comedy skip this film.
1,One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.  Bad acting, terrible writing.  Waste of time.
1,I bought this DVD on a friends recomendation, never listen to him again.  The only decent character was Ted Nugent.  The acting was week, the story was too predictable and the jokes were all recycled.  Might be worth a rental but wasn't a keeper.
1,As much as I love this opera, this production was awful.  I do not mind modern stagings but this one was just too weird.  Such a pity because Charles Castronova has a gorgeous voice and is an excellent actor.  What a waste of such an incredibly talented opera singer.
1,There is a place fearful to those of us who enjoy good and solid films.  This is a place where a person can watch a film and after about ten minutes desire to pull their own eyes out.  Truly Silver Hawk is one of the worst films I have ever seen.  After the first 10 minutes I truthfully felt like jumping out of a window for wasting 5 dollars at Blockbuster.  I later found the will to live by watching Spiderman 2, Blade, and Batman Begins.		I have no idea what the director or the actors were thinking of when they took on this assignment.  So as not to rant and rave forever about the emotions I felt upon watching this.....horrible thing called a DVD here are my problems with it.		The movie is basically a take off of the whole Bruce Wayne style hero who is wealthy aristacrate by day hero by night.  In this case though Michelle Yeoh's character, Lulu aka Silverhawk fights crime ONLY in broad daylight.  I don't think that night time even exists in this movie.  The action scenes are overdone and never present themselves as really anything of danger.  At one point Silver Hawk saves a bride at an outdoor wedding by catching a falling peice of plywood with her fingers.		There really is no plot, and Silver Hawk's war on crime seems really like pretend to begin with, as the film never presents itself as something that can be taken seriously.  What is also disappointing is the fact that Michelle Yeoh, Michael Jai White, and Luke Goss have played in major films before.		My best advice for anyone even considering watching this film is.....life is to precious to loose time on a movie this bad.
1,I could not sit through it
1,Great cast, horrid storyline.
1,Hollywood's grip on reality or politics just entered the flailing propaganda stage. Yuck! Hyper actors have no real wit or humor, et tu Brute?
1,The Bottom Line:		I know tons of people who esteem Ghost World but I found that it came off as pretentious and not terribly interesting--because the film is a polarizing piece of art, I would recommend (if you want to watch the film) renting before buying.
1,'Wondrous Oblivion' is a story that had the potential to be very good; unfortunately it fell far short of what it could have been.		On the positive side, the message communicated is quite good.  The story is set in London in the 1960s in a very racially intolerant area.  David Wiseman is a young Jewish boy who is also an immigrant from Germany.  He and his family face bigotry in their daily lives.		David is obsessed with the game of cricket.  He has no talent, but a great love for the game.  He has never had anyone to coach him and develop his ability.  Then another family of immigrants moves next door.  They also face discrimination from the neighbors.		The father, Dennis Samuels, takes young David under his wing and teaches him a lot about the game of cricket and develops his talents.  This and some other parts show some great human kindness.		On the negative side, this film is really boring and amateurish.  It could have even been worse with the plot built around cricket, which is probably the world's most boring sport.  (I once went to a match with some friends in another country and after being bored to tears for about six hours, I found out that they were just getting started on a game that lasts a week or so).  The creator did minimize the damage that cricket could do to the movie by not focusing on it too much.		Besides being boring, it was clearly the work of unskilled filmmakers.  Either that, or the movie industry is in worse shape even than I thought.  I think that from a professionalism standpoint, this DVD is several notches below 'Napolean Dynamite'.		My recommendation would be to pass on this one.
1,Jamie Foxx does an excellent impersonation of Ray Charles, but that's only good for about 20 minutes worth of entertainment. The movie goes on long after the novelty wears off, retelling events sequentially with the occasional childhood flashback. Who would've thought a musical legend's life could be so boring? Well, ok, I guess you wouldn't call philandering and drug addiction boring, but watching it repeatedly is another story. Occasionally a caption pops up telling you what year it is (and you really do feel it's been a year since the last one). Then it ends abruptly, almost as if someone said, "Whoo-boy, this sure getting long. We'd better just stop here."		As for the story, Ray Charles is not portrayed in a very sympathetic light. Early on he says, "Don't feel sorry for me because I'm blind." Not only did I not feel sorry for him, I actually started to like him less because of his callous behavior toward others. He eventually does defeat his demons, but then what? Then the movie's over, that's what.		Instead of a quick blurb about the final four decades of his life, maybe we could've been shown how he matured during that time. Did he regret having treated those close to him so shabbily? Did he do anything to make amends, where possible? Was he able to mend his relationships with his wife and kids? Too many questions were left hanging--and those were the things that might have helped me to understand him better as a person. I guess a lot could be inferred from the ending, but then so could most of the repetition of his seamier activities, which were dwelled upon so heavily. I found the whole thing overrated and disappointing.		By the way, the extended version with added scenes was very poorly done. There was no effort whatsoever to be selective or to blend the addional footage in seamlesslely--it was disruptive to the movie's flow, adding to the overall feeling of disjointedness. At one point there are actually four different "takes" of a brief scene, one after the other; it was disturbing and almost comical. If you do rent or buy this, I recommend you skip the extended version, at least the first time through.
1,Enough about the ending already, sure it was a clever move, but there`s so much more to find here...right? Well, that`s the problem, this movie works nicely on the first viewing, but I don`t really feel the need to watch it again. It`s not very engaging, moves too slowly and if it wasn`t for the final twist it would be quickly forgotten. Ok, the cinematography is alright, the acting good and the mood adequate, but there are a couple of plot inconsistencies and during the most part I was just waiting for something to happen. The ghost element is well done, though, but Shyamalan can do better ("Unbreakable"). A promising debut anyway.
1,Could have been so much more.
1,Lara Croft type of running and jumping around.	Marooned human colony wore clothing borrowed from Mad Max, which is now apparently the standard costume for the post-apocalyptic scenario. Also, various  "aliens"  had wobbly rubber prosthetics that were so unconvincing that it was tedious to watch. Robbed the movie of any potential for spectacle. Otherwise, if you are into endless aerobics, running and jumping in a bizarre context, it might be entertaining. Haha! Oh well! : )
1,Sad but slow movie. Great acting though!
1,My personal opinion		The Good:		Nothing was good about this movie.		The Bad:		1. Adam Sandler's Dracula voice	2. Overall plot was thin and required little imagination	3. Annoying characters that were LOUD throughout the movie	4. Animation wasn't particularly enjoyable to look at	5. Movie was comprised mostly of random scenes with boring jokes		Yes, I hated this movie.  It was completely boring.  The plot was dumb and uninteresting. The characters were annoying and the voices were grating.  Even for a kid's movie, this one is sub par to many other 3D animated kid's films past and present.
1,This is more of the same garbage of the blind leaders of the blind. The rapture DOES NOT COME BEFORE THE TRIBULATION. Jesus says his word will judge at the last day(John 12:48). So what does his word say. See Matthew 24:29-31:	Mat 24:29  Immediately after the tribulation of those days...	Mat 24:30	Mat 24:31  And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.	If you read 1 THES. 1:1 AND 1:4 YOU CAN SEE THE CHURCH IS THE ELECT.
1,ok, notwell written
1,Funny at times but way over the top with the F-bombs, would have been better with out the ruff language!!!
1,Murder By Death, 1976 film		A man sends invitations to famous detectives (from fiction) to visit his mansion. [No mention of fees, so you know this isn't real.] Lionel Twain lives on an island. A rickety bridge connects to this island. The detectives arrive and are shown to their rooms. The new cook cannot speak, hear, or read English. The butler can't see. They try to communicate. Sam Diamond arrives with his secretary Tess. Next Dick and Dora Charleston. Inspector Wang arrives with his son Willy. Inspector Perrier arrives with his chauffeur Marcel. Is Wang wrong? Miss Jessica Marbles arrives with her nurse. Why five detectives? Perrier explains the test with Wang. Blind people have a keen sense of smell. "Tacky?" The blind butler talks to the deaf cook. The lights go dead. "Franks and beans?" Then Lionel Twain appears. [No joke here.] "You look like number two."		Can the five greatest detectives solve a murder in a locked mansion? Two million cash plus film rights? Charades? The cook draws their attention. "This man is dead." "Where is everyone?" A voice speaks to them. "Say your pronouns." They find the butler again. Then the dining room is empty again. [A cheap trick?] "Two dining rooms." The cook disappeared. Midnight passes. They find a body, as predicted. "Nobody move!" Dick Charleston offers a solution, but Inspector Wang trumps him (and exposes a character). "I'm a Belgie!" There are more exposures and confessions from the others. [Believable?] There are threats for the occupants of each bedroom. [More silliness here.] Sidney Wang solves the crime! Who did it? A plastic body. Others have their solution. "How did you know?" There is a final surprise! When the show is over the detectives all leave. There is a final unmasking to end this story. Believable?		This is a parody of Agatha Christie's famous murder mystery "Ten Little Indians". Those who write parodies are usually less talented than the original writer, as shown by this story. If you don't know of the other fictional detectives you will miss the point of this story. A parody is limited to the original story. The ending with the switching of identities damages this story, as if they don't know when to end this joke.	Dashiell created "Nick and Nora Charles" and "Sam Spade"("The Thin Man", "The Maltese Falcon"). "Mr Wong" was a copy of "Charlie Chan". Agatha Christie created "Hercule Poirot" and "Miss Marple" for many mystery novels.
1,Horrible recording.  I'm not happy at all.  I was so excited to see another vincent price movie bit this was such a bad recording I couldn't watch it !
1,roo crazy for me
1,This film is like the Three Stooges having a bad drug trip.
1,Very different from District 9 in every way. District 9 was unique, uncomfortable (in a good way), and socially relevant. Elysium is Damon doing the liberal left wing dance... again. This guy should go ahead and enter politics, that is, officially. We all know where he stands and that's fine, but his movies are becoming less and less entertaining. Propaganda films are supposed to be far less expensive... documentaries are supposed to be non-fiction... and political adds for the left are supposed to air on CNBC, posing as news stories. I trusted the director for another gut wrenching film- one that challenged my soul; instead I just feel a sense of blah and nausea. Damon's self righteous blather is just plain boring. He has transformed from innovative to insufferable.
1,I initially thought this film would be a winner based on its title and storyline, but after watching I felt it could have utilized a better cast and  screenplay.
1,Either the last episode of "Sopranos" was infuenced by this flick when it was in-production, or vice versa.  All I know is that both open-ended "endings" DO NOT aestheticaly jive with all that precedes it.  This movie is like the Titanic in its last half-hour afloat: listing, horribly.  The first 2/3rds are damn good action thriller stuff - and the last 3rd is philosophic B.S. that makes the film not only tank - but makes it seem extremely artifically constructed.  A let-down!  And I'm not even saying that Good had to triumph over Evil to make this a satisfactory film - what I am saying is that the film is intrinsically unbalanced, artfully contrived and thereby the viewers are sucked into a Sopranos syndrome....and lest we sound stupid, we jump onto the praise bandwagon and the Oscar buzz hype hypnotizes people into becoming leemings!  If you want to see a great film that consistently delivers and was almost totally snubbed by the Oscars, watch "The Assassination of Jesse James..." Anyway, back to "Old Men":  much ado about nothing!  As to cinema now having a gripping new Oscar-worthy nut-case criminal to rival Hannibal, just because this killer drags around an oxygen tank and speaks softly with a slight smile does not make for great acting or a classic new criminal! Hype and hypnotism now rule not only what we get to see out of Hollwood's choice of what the powers-that-be choose to push and distribute - but we get sucked into the "bandwagon brainwash" syndrome.  "No Country for Old Men" = "No Film for Thinking Men"!
1,It felt like Terminator 2 was the end, I mean, skynets ruined, the chips have been destroyed, and it's suppose to leave the rest up to the people to decide the unwritten future.  So at first, I immedietly felt like they were blowing a $170,000,000 budget on a unexpected sequal.  But being a fan of this series, I had to check it out		Well it's gonna be hard to adjust with no Linda Hamilton, or Edward Furlong(Who was John Conor not Nick Stahl).  And it always has a bad guy or good, but it's bad, andthis time the antigonist is a female terminator, an enticer huh?		Arnold is back, which is a good thing, cuz replacing him would be a travesty.  Other than him, the only other cast member to return was Earl Boen(Dr. Silberman)  Who in this movie felt like he saw a ghost.  James Camron is not back to dierect, because of problems with Linda Hamilton, and he felt like the series was complete when T2 was finished.  Well is that good or bad.		Anyway onto the story.  Judgment day wasn't stopped it was postponed, so here we go again.  Well the action sceenes are nowhere near as spectacular as T2.  This Terminator feels like it ain't going all out, which the previous 2 did, they seemed like they wound never stop, but this one looked like one that could be challenged by the protagonist. And it doesn't give a real sense of danger like the previous 2 did.  Not only that, this film was nowhere near as groundbreaking as it's predicessors		I didn't expect alot from this movie, but dang!  I though it woulndn't be this bad.  Man if only James Camron were behind the film or if it were never made.  They were trying too hard for a sequal that never should have been made.  It was boring most of the way, it felt like it tried to move with the style of new films, and the real geniouses behind the series, sadly, weren't there to finish it off.  I'm very sad to see such a good series get tarnished by it's final film.(Nearly the same thing that happened in the Godfather PT.3)  The only reason this film is bairly even rentable, is because Arnold is still around, but he couldn't fill the shoes of those who left.		peace
1,I suspected this would be one of those movies with funny people and a lousy script.  I was right. Biggs character is just a dud and a waste of time in the story. Cook is at his foulest and over the top most of the movie.  There are only a  few funny parts.		Its just not very good. Save yourself the money and just rent it.
1,The acting was good but the movie was slow moving and boring.  But then again, back then things did move more slowly.
1,Where's a Zero rating when you need one?	This is just ... a mess. Overrun with mean-spiritedness, the vileness of the anti-female ramblings is matched only by the sub-amateur production values.	The writing is awful. The camerawork is headache-inducing. The acting would look bad on the stage of the worst gosapel stage show you ever saw.	Obviously, renting a camcorder and tripod from the local camera store does NOT qualify you as the next Spike Lee. If this is the best you can do, you're not even the next Matty Rich!	How bad is this movie? Take the "skeletons in the closet" rant from "Eddie Murphy: Raw" and multiply it by 1,000! Every woman these guys know is a "farm tool," "witch with a B in front" or worse. There's not one redeeming female character. There's not even one redeeming MALE character!	These are familiar faces, but these actors can do better than this. Based on these performances, they should really reconsider their career goals.	If Winky Dinky Dog won't take them back, there's always work at the post office.
1,"Minus one star!"
1,What creeps you out?  Zombies?  Masked intruders?  Carnivorous plants?  Cancer?  That guy at the gas station store who always smells like onions and never trims his nails?		Maybe I'm just not doing my homework, but it seems to me like, recently, writers/directors of "scary" movies have decided that what is really, truly scary is simply being scared.  In other words, forget the actual concept of horror, let's not go to the trouble of coming up with a creative and unsettling premise.  Let's just come up with a bad guy, toss him (or her, or it) some victims, and have the poor, doomed dopes get batted around for an hour and a half.		THE RUINS and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Strangers/dp/B00005JPSB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Strangers</a>&nbsp;are two remarkably different films in tone, pacing, style and substance, but at their core, they are both dismally, lamentably alike.  Both of them wholeheartedly believe that if they can scare the characters in their films, then that is the exact same thing as scaring the audience watching those characters.		THE RUINS will attract more viewers, but only because it's gorier.  It wears its blood on its sleeve, let's say.  Based on Scott Smith's flawed and overlong&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/book/dp/0307389715/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">book</a>, the movie takes the only thing about the book that worked -- the character development -- and completely tosses that out the window.  What you're left with are six carbon copy twenty-somethings (yes! younger viewers, there IS gratuitous nudity, and boy, is it gratuitous!) who must fight against an insidious force that dwells among them!		I'm just kidding.  I lifted that last line from the book jacket.  They don't fight the insidious force.  They just fight each other.  Aside from some squeamish bits involving legs and the threat of sepsis, the only thing about the film that's supposed to be scary is the fact that the "insidious force" takes its sweet, sweet time killing the vacationers when, by all accounts, it could've obliterated them within minutes of their arrival.  But, see, that wouldn't be scary, would it?  Eschewing even the tiniest shred of plausibility that would make it endurable, THE RUINS artlessly banks on the concept that watching a cat toy with a mouse is a riveting, suspenseful and horrifying experience.  When, in fact, you eventually just yell at the cat to eat the poor thing already.		<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Strangers/dp/B001D2WU9I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Strangers</a>, with its Hitchcockian patience and unsteady uncertainty, makes a bit more sense in this score.  A young couple returns from a wedding to a summer home, only to be terrorized all night by three masked intruders.  Just like THE RUINS, the ending is forcasted from the opening credits.  Unlike Scott Smith's movie, however, THE STRANGERS's devious devilry makes a bit more sense, considering its source.  After all, humans are more likely to thrive off of the power-trip of terror than vines.  (Whoops.  I think I may have just given away the secret of THE RUINS.  Ha ha.  I'm just kidding.  THE RUINS has no secrets.)		Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman (or, as I like to call them,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Aerosmith/dp/B000068QZI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Aerosmith</a>'s Daughter and That Guy From&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Felicity/dp/B00005JLJS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Felicity</a>) as our estranged and horrified young couple, do a pretty good job of making us feel their fear, but the movie still falls flat in the usual places.  Characters fail to believe anything odd is going on until it is Too Late.  The victims make the obligatory Dumbest Decision Ever ("Let's split up!").  And, of course, just like THE RUINS, the movie is only as scary as the Bad Guys are deliberately and gratuitously trying to be.  (No, younger viewers, the "gratuitous" in this case does not involve nudity.)		I've always been a fan of scary movies because of the primal reaction that terror engenders in me (and in most people, I think).  In that sense, I can empathize with the poor, clueless cannon fodder that get chewed and abused in both of these films.  But empathy, as necessary as it may be for horror films, will only get you so far.  After all, I am entertained by fear only as long as I feel that fear.  I don't get my jollies watching other people get scared out of their wits.		But if you do?  Well, now you know what to watch.
1,I find it grimly ironic that LucasFilm Ltd et al are falling all over themselves to provide DVDs of these two Ewok TV shows in all their uncut glory, rather than, say, A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi.  Apparently, according to LFL spokesman Jim Ward, it's because there is such demand in the fan base for these Ewok films.  Say what?		These two "films," effectively TV shows, aren't terrible, but they're pure 1980s drivel and are simply overrun with furry, reviled Ewoks that don't even have the benefit of turning into scaled horrors when dunked in water, unlike Mogwai.  I mean, I'm pretty sure there are neon headbands involved.  That's never a good sign.		Frankly I'm surprised Lucas hasn't chopped these things up into bits either to "get them to where he wanted if he'd had the appropriate technology at the time".  Here are some desperately needed changes that the boys down in the CGI Revisionism Department could pump out in a day:		1)  All the slain parents now appear as ghosts at the end of the films.  However, they are not the ages the parents were when they died, but are children for some reason.  This is accepted by all without question.		2)  The brother never shoots first.  In fact, he never shoots at all, and all blasters fatally backfire when triggered to demonstrate the perils of not sharing.		3)  Instead of spears, the Ewoks all wield harmless flashlights.		4)  Both films are narrated by beloved Lucas brainchild Jar Jar Binks.  In fact, he dubs all the character lines too.		5)  At the end of each film, Gungans are shown celebrating for some reason.		6)  A CGI Yoda bounds constantly around the landscape like Clay Aiken on speed, spouting hip phrases like "tubular to the max, dude," and "jam the pipe to the extremez!"		7)  As a consequence of the massively saccharine nature of the proceedings, a new "PG-0" rating is instituted, which means the films are suitable for playing against the stomachs of expectant mothers to better inculcate their children to a lifetime of mindless unquestioning grasping at the LucasFilm teat.		8)  Every human being who manages to do something is discovered to have billions of "midichlorians" and to be the result of an immaculate conception, presumably by God himself.		9)  Every tenth frame is a Hyperspace logo.		10)  The DVDs come with special, patented LFL "CGI Cancer", which spreads from scene to scene over the course of your ownership of the DVDs, gradually turning them into episodes of "The Thundercats".  Only a monthly payment of $9.95 to LucasFilm temporarily arrests this process.
1,Unlike many of the reviewers here, I'm not a biblical expert and really don't care if the movie adheres to the stories as they are portrayed in the bible. I would just judge the movie based on its entertainment value and ability to engage me emotionally.		The biggest problem with this movie was that it simply seemed to be too long and drawn out. There were also some scenes that felt like padding and added nothing to the story (and in some cases detracted from it). For instance, during the long voyage while the earth was covered by water, everyone goes a bit crazy. That's an acceptable premise but it's played out theatrically for far too long and in a variety of embarrassing scenes for the actors. The idea that they suffered madness was fine to introduce but it shouldn't have taken up so much time nor been quite so adbsurdly plotted out like a little play.		There were also a couple of ridiculous encounters on the water (between Lot acting as a pirate and a merchant who sold them various trinkets for water) which undermined the entire story of the great flood. Everyone was supposed to have perished in the flood and it was a bit absurd that a few would be sailing the high seas on little boats. It was just plain silly and, again, seemed to be put in just to pad the story or add unnecessary "spice" (it didn't work as a means of jazzing up the story).		I'm guessing the writers felt the time on the water had to be long to show how Noah and his family suffered or had their faith tested but they also felt it had to be more interesting than just lounging on the boat and taking care of the animals. This type of insecurity with telling a story in the most effective way is what causes so many productions to go bad.		To the movie's credit, the actors are quite good and there are some good moments but too much of the movie doesn't work.
1,A series of gruesome murders are rocking the city of Boston.  The latest to die is a prostitute.  The next morning, Dr. Jekyll (Dougray Scott) wakes up with blood on his hands.  That puts him in a panic, and he quickly returns home to his basement lab to work on some experiments.		But when things don't get better, Dr. Jekyll decides to turn himself in.  Going to his old friend Gabe Utterson (Tom Skerritt), he hires pretty lawyer Claire Wheaton (Krista Bridges) to help him quickly wave his trial and appeals so he can turn himself in and then be given the death sentence.  Why?  Because he is responsible for the crimes.  Almost.		Dr. Jekyll, it turns out, has been experimenting with the extract of a rare Amazon flower, rumor to be able to separate the good from a bad in a person.  And it has sort of worked.  Jekyll has created Edward Hyde (also Dougray Scott), and evil person responsible for the murders.  Since there seems to be no antidote in sight, Jekyll figures the only way to stop the monster is to die himself.  Will Claire go along with the plan?  Is there a cure?  Can Hyde be stopped?		I seem to have become more forgiving of literary adaptations, not expecting them to stick to the source page for page.  Still, the closer a book is to my heart, the harder time I have letting go.  I love the novella that is the inspiration for this story.  As a result, I find this movie pretty bad.		Most of the problem is that the movie strips the book of its power.  The original story is a tragedy and morality tale about allowing evil into our lives.  While that is still here, it isn't nearly as prominent, instead becoming a courtroom drama.		Even letting the book go, I find the movie hard to enjoy.  It's very slow.  I couldn't find the character's actions very believable.  I hated the "surprise" ending.  And the performances are only acceptable.		Other than that, I liked it.		The idea of filming the story in a modern setting could certainly work, but this isn't the film to do it.  Skip it and read the original novella instead.  It's a much better use of your time and won't take that much longer.
1,no comment
1,while the 3d looks good, and the cg is well done, and there is a thing that says "i am groot" 61 times during the movie, i don't see what the big deal is with this movie.		this movie is the same thing EVERY marvel movie has been in the last 6-7 years, or so. likeable good guy with proverbial chip on shoulder (thats probably worth money or likes or internet karma, or something), bad guy does a thing to try to steal the "chip" on heros shoulder. they chase each other around, they make friends, they chase more. space battles zOMG! duh and.		its retarded.
1,Let me start by saying that I love superhero movies...when they're well done. This movie isn't.		It's too long by at least 30 minutes, the plot is extremely weak, some of the newer superhero characters just don't fit, a couple of them are terrible, and the fights scenes are so frequent and similar that they just become repetitive and actually boring.		The newer additions; the version of Spiderman in this movie is awful. I know he's supposed to be a teenager and so nave and irreverent but he just comes off as annoying and actually kind of stupid. The witch girl (I can't even recall her name) is much more suited for one of the X-men movies, she doesn't fit at all in an Avengers movie, she was glaringly out of place. And Ant Man, I know Ant Man goes way back, I remember his comics as a kid. I found them absurd then and I still do. My wife, who is just a casual fan of these types of movies but had really liked some of them actually laughed out loud when Ant Man showed up, and not in a good way. Paul Rudd is a good comedic actor and he does his best but, Ant Man should have been left in the pages of his seldom read comic books.		As stated earlier, the fight scenes were so frequent and similar that they became meaningless. I mean, they spend half the movie pounding on one another to no appreciable outcome; no one dies, no one is seriously injured (yes, I know War Hammer is but by the scene at the end of the credits he's already getting better), the fights are pointless. They're also silly; Black Widow asks another character if they're still friends, while she's trying to beat him senseless...stupid. Captain America and Spider-boy bond because one's from Queens and the other from Brooklyn...even more stupid.		The impression I got from this movie was that someone from Marvel thought it would be cool if all the super heroes started fighting with each other but they couldn't come up with a viable plot to make that happen...so they came up with the semi-plot in this movie. Suddenly Iron Man and Captain America are sworn enemies, even though everyone knows, including Iron Man, that he's mistaken about the reason they started fighting in the first place. Doesn't make sense, doesn't work, isn't worth watching.
1,Dawn of the Living Dead (David Heavener, 2004)		NOTE: the following review (well, the first paragraph) contains a major spoiler for this movie. Be warned.		Is there anything more satisfying in low-budget horror these days than watching Joe Estevez die horribly? And the best part is, it's so easy to find. Per IMDB, Mr. Estevez (who, in case the look and the voice didn't tip you off, is Martin Sheen's brother, Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez' uncle) appeared in sixteen movies in 2010 alone. Without actually investigating, I'd say, simply judging by the titles, a little over half of those are horror movies. I'd further say, given my recent experiences with flicks in which Joe Estevez appears, he probably died (and horribly) in three-quarters of those. I mean, you can't really go wrong with a Joe Estevez movie, as long as you're only looking for "Joe Estevez Bites It. Horribly.". If you're looking for a good movie, on the other hand, you're almost certainly better off looking elsewhere. Estevez, over the past quarter-century, has made some choices that would have been career-killers for just about anyone else. Soultaker. Sigma Die!. Legend of the Roller Blade Seven. (And a sequel!) Zombie Farm. I Got the Hook-Up (which I think actually did kill a number of careers). Dawn of the Living Dead, which was originally titled Evil Grave: Curse of the Maya. Subsequently retitled, one assumes, to appeal to the Romero-loving crowd.		Plot: A former mental patient, Renee (Things You Don't Tell's Amanda Bauman), and her doctor, Jeffrey (Estevez), with whom she has fallen hopelessly in love, move out to the middle of the Arizona desert, presumably to continue her recovery. While wandering through the desert one afternoon, she comes upon Michael (martial artist Heavener), a caretaker for the surrounding windmills, and his mentally-challenged assistant Herardo (Todd Bridges... yes, that Todd Bridges). Since they seem to be the only people within hundreds of miles, Renee invites Michael back to the house for dinner, where he tells them that the house (which Jeffrey got on ebay, sight unseen) was the site of the recent murder of a family of illegal immigrants; immigrants, it seems, had been using it as a safe-house for some time. The dead are restless, and Renee finds that she must figure out who the killer is before they devour everyone in sight.		David Heavener's acting is... indescribable. Suffice to say that in the scenes they have together, he makes Joe Estevez (by far the best actor in this joint) look good. As Joe was never, shall we say, blessed with the talent of the rest of the family, that takes some doing. And then there is Bridges, who seems to have taken every emotion from the "I'm a mess" years and channelled them into this character, about whom nothing politically correct can be said (he is, in the classical sense of the phrase, a low-functioning moron). There are actors who have made careers out of effectively playing the mentally challenged, Billy Bob Thornton (Sling Blade) and Leonardo di Caprio (What's Eating Gilbert Grape?) being two modern examples. Todd Bridges will never gain that kind of recognition based on this performance. And, as Captain Peacock was won't to say, "thank heaven for that".		Heavener's IMDB page notes that, in addition to being a martial artist, he also composes and performs Christian music (whether contemporary or gospel is not specified). Judging by this movie, at least, he should abandon the film career and take up music full-time. It can't be any worse than this. A much better take on this same basic idea, though with ghosts instead of zombies, was released the same year, called <em>Kucuk Kiyamet</em>, in Turkey. Much harder to find in America, I'm sure, but a much, much more rewarding film than this. (half)
1,Extremely low budget, terrible acting, everywhere the characters go, it has a yellow tint in the camera. Not only that but before turning it off about 5 mins in, I realized that the beginning credits were done in windows movie maker with that generic fading text tool.
1,Not worth all the money I spent. No where near as good as original
1,I saw the trailer for this Keanu Reeve movie, and it looked very appealing, so much so that I lept at the opportunity to see it when it finally hit the theatres. Ah, such disappointments are not rare enough, sorry to say.	This was my first Keanu, and I believe it shall be my last. I think he might make a very good Curious George, but he's not a good leading man at all. Anthony Quinn at 80 is more attractive than this whippersnapper will ever be.	Other parts of the movie are not so bad, so if you want to go for a stroll, take "A Walk in the Clouds", but you won't bump into anything like an excellent movie while you're up there.
1,So there's risque language without the body-talk to back it up. It's like watching pretty girls and guys chatting stereotypically inside a teenager's dream with neither style nor substance.  I gave up with this film after this dialogue came out:  "Fleas are people too.".
1,I'm giving this 1 star for the beautiful scenery (what little of it there is) and for the charm of Heidi, though it's buried beneath a completely dreary and unloveable cast.  I entered into this film determined not to compare it to the book, but even in its own right it is depressing.  For the most part the people are a miserable lot of selfish, churlish personalities----all need to be socialized.  Leaving Heidi in a freezing cold barn all night?!  And what's with the whole "ghost" thing??  Or Heidi falling over a cliff?  Cheesy and predictable at best and utterly melodramatic.  Hollywood with their christian-phobia (unless they're beating and nailing Jesus to the cross) just couldn't make the leap and have Heidi pray to God.  Instead she talks to a star.  If we're going to massacre the Heidi story then I'll take the Shirley Temple version and walk away loving most of the characters and having some sympathy for Klara.  It would have helped to first develop the bond with the blind grandmother and Peter in the beginning.  This is 3 hours long----(and I mean l-o-n-g); surely there could have been plenty of time for us to revel in the beauty of the alps with some likable mountain people (except for the mean and cold grandfather).  But instead, we're shuffled off in no time to spend the vast majority of time  in a mansion with a bunch of sullen, dreary, melancholy and angry characters; even Klara comes across sniveling and unbelievable---even when she's trying (really hard) to be light and happy.  She's actually dull and unlikable, and concerned with her own selfish wants.  The father has issues; we'll just leave it at that.  Waste of money for me.  I won't even bother to drag my grandchildren through this.  I'll buy the Shirley Temple version and they'll be delighted.
1,This is nothing but rightwing propaganda. Pure lies. But hey, its what the right wing does best. LIE.~~~~~ Junk, not worth squat and a waste of time.
1,with stupid twists and actions scenes and triple crosses, I thought this movie was a yawn. proably the worst from Joel Shumacher if not that but its right up there with his worst list. Rock is a total bore and he jokes aren't great and Hopkins is wasted and never shouldve even been in this one. purely for stupid people.
1,I like a good wedding flick as well as the next person.  This movie was filled with dumb people trying to be the person that they thought everyone else wanted them to be.  Not my kind of movie at all.  Wasted hour.  Don't bother.
1,I was all ready to buy this set to replace the vhs tapes I have had for several years. However, I was so disappointed to see that these discs have neither subtitles nor closed captioning, which my husband and I need. We will continue to watch the tapes, which have closed captioning and hope for a better product at the same price.
1,husband is a believable actor, well done playing the evil guy, not the rest, just bad acting, bad action scenes, then I stopped watching when two cops sit in their car when they hear a gun shot, then see a puddle of blood and only think of tea, dumb, stupid, annoying and I could not watch any more.
1,Oh, man. Spoiler Alert!		I enjoyed this show, naiive Scandinavian writing aside (really, the plot development is pretty linear with a lot of unnecessary fluff). But! Episode six of season one saw one of the most bizaare plot twist/manipulations I've ever seen. It was so ham-fisted and insulting to the intelligence of the viewer that I found myself gasping: "wtf?". So, sorry for the spoiler alert, but this scene totally determines my review of the whole show. Yup. It's that defining and damning of a scene:		The little boy, Liam, who is cast with a kid upon whom zero requirements are made, had mumps. He was so sick, they sat watch on him all day and all night. His dad, a studly search-and-rescue guy, leaves his son's bedside to have sex with the sexy Spanish waitress who seems to have sex with everyone, which isn't so hard to do in this town of a few hundred. While dad is out gallivanting, Liam walks, half-naked, through the ice and snow to the professor's house. The professor is shocked to discover him on his porch, frozen and in a daze. He brings him in. Warms him up up. While he's inspecting the young lad's feet, the kid bashes his brains out with a cutting board. As if that isn't wtf enough, there follows the scene where they show us HOW they learned this tidbit about the sick young Liam: You see, Liam, the ten year old with the written dialogue of a five year old, had frostbite on his toesies after his midnight murder stroll. Though no toes were lost, they opted to put Liam into an induced coma. In an iron lung. From which he had to be awakened in order to be questioned. "But," argued the doctor to the amazing-as-always Steven Tucci, "if I wake him up the pain in his toesies will be unbearable. You are a monster for daring to awaken this ten year old boy from his INDUCED COMA. If you wake him up (I swear, I lost it. This review is proof!), he will not recover from his second-degree frostbite AS QUICKLY."		If that isn't dumb enough for you to avoid this show altogether, then you're a glutton for punishment. I have warned you. The feeling of bewilderment I, as the viewer, felt as they sunk Liam back into his induced coma FOR FROSTBITE, as he lay writhing and screaming inside his iron lung, screaming from the "unimaginable pain" (yes. This was said), was akin to my having witnessed a questionable act. I felt sort of guilty for having watched it. Like I'd scene a beheading, or watched a snuff film. It was so unimaginably badly and tastelessly portrayed. The convenience for the writers of having nothing what-so-ever to do with developing Liam. The murderer. Who committed the murder the whole show twists on. I felt sickened at the stupidly written abuse contained within this whole scene. The viewer's intelligence is abused. So is the child-character in the show. How is this not some sadistic Nazi-era method of torture? What culture uses this tech to treat a child? Three or four days in a coma. For frostbite. He did not lose any toesies.		So, I urge you not to watch this. Don't subject Tucci to any more embarrassment by seeing this. Let's just forget this, yet another Scandinavian offering of extremely questionable writing that can only stem from a cultural pattern of TV shows (far worse than the Brits for silly linear, convenient plot developments). I mean who didn't catch this as being sickening. Then on with the show? I don't think so.
1,It wasn't funny to me.
1,Last week while I was getting my van serviced so it could pass the state emissions test for tag renewal in an abandoned parking lot of Sears store. I overheard that Glenn Becked fella on the radio. He was going on and on about how our border on the United States side to Mexico were unsecured. What a burden to our economy this fiasco was. So much so, that people were just crossing the border by the truck and train loads in unaccountable numbers. It seemed as if it was some coordinated invasion from an unseen mastermind.	Knowing Mr Beckett, I can only imagine who he was referring to.	Most of those people were unaccompanied minors. He went on how we should feed and clothe them to help them feel welcome here in America. That in itself would be cause for alarm for most people, especially their parents. Where were their parents in all this?	Indeed, where were their parents?	Years ago, my grandma and I had trouble with raccoons digging through our trash at night. It wasn't until we turned on the porch light or left the sprinklers on all night that they stopped coming around. After seeing an old black and white Disney episode of Davy Crockett, I realized that I wanted a coon hat like his.	That night I left the porch light and sprinklers off.	The next day, I went to church with a fresh new coon hat.	In what was initially considered an annoyance, became an opportunity.	The next day, I took my van down to the border and sure enough, groups of ten to fifty people were making their way across the border. It was difficult to hold back tears of joy knowing they would soon be citizens of this good nation and vote Democrat by right of passage.	Then, I spotted a group of kids and called them over to my van. I offered them employment on the modest plot of land  near my grandmother's trailer. There was a small partially underground tool shed they could sleep in to stay out of the Texas heat.	As we headed north, one of the kids wanted to drive. He must of been ten or twelve. In his broken English he said he had been doing it for years.	I believed him and he did prove to be quite the driver, albeit very slow. Sitting in the back of the van with the other kids, I put in this movie. I thought it would be an inspirational instructional farming video similar to what the Disney Johnny Appleseed was. This movie was far removed from being that. It was just a bunch of foreign mumbo jumbo and things blowing up unnecessarily. Beyond that, it was difficult to get past the lead girl and her crossed eyes.	We never finished the movie, but we still managed to enjoy the ride home.	Home indeed.
1,Poorly made movie , video blurry
1,Boring
1,I really thought this movie was going to be great.  Jack Black and Jason Segel, this couldn't be bad !  Well, I was wrong.  My wife and I gutted out an hour of watching before we turned it off.  Don't waste your time here.  This is in my top 10 worst movies ever.
1,The movie is slow and despite star power they ever went to sleep filming it
1,save your money
1,Mike Myers ("Austin Powers," "Wayne's World") stars in this satire of New Age self-help. He's an Indian guru Pitka who's a star for his cheesy acronym-laden advice, but wants to get to the next level. He sees his chance when the owner of a hockey team (Jessica Biel) wants him to help one of her star players who's devastated about his girl leaving him. Myers has to get the player back together to get his girl so the player will start hitting pucks again.		This was Mike Myers' attempt to start a new franchise and re-launch his career. It may just have killed his career instead. This movie was just so horribly misguided. It was everything terrible about Austin Powers and none of the things we liked.		I think this movie started with Myers going through his bag of accents to see which ones he could build a character out of: "My British accent worked last time. I do a good Indian accent, let's do that." But the idea of a white man playing an Indian guru is just such a bad idea that it should have killed the movie. Then they doubled-down by deciding to put a prosthetic hooked nose on Myers to make him look "Indian," even though Pitka is supposed to be a white man adopted in India. When the movie opens with Pitka playing "9 to 5" on a sitar while riding around on elephants and fringed pillows, the racism crosses from kind of funny to flat-out offensive.		Besides the racism, the movie tries so hard to offend people, which I don't like. It's one thing to do edgy humor, but another to do humor just for the sake of being offensive. "Love Guru" has probably the most jokes about male anatomy of any comedy I've seen. For example, Justin Timberlake plays Jacque LeCoque, a well-endowed rival who is one of the few bright spots of the movie, even if his role is just a bunch of penis jokes. At a certain point, I felt like "okay, we get it. Find another source of humor."		I also felt like Myers only added the role of the coach (Verne Troyer) so he could make fun of him, since the coach's role existed almost entirely on short jokes.		All of the above could have been okay if the movie itself was funny, and it's just not. The tone is all over the place with jokes thrown at the screen every few seconds and very few of them are actually good. I did think a couple jokes were good, but they weren't worth grinding through the unfunny parts.		On the whole, "Love Guru" was a terrible movie with a terrible idea and a terrible story that wasn't very funny. I really hope Myers gets to make another movie, because he's a really funny guy. Maybe he'll do a better job next time.
1,....!  worst action movie ever.  the story in the first game was alot better.  for those who don't know in the game laura was contracted to seek out an artifact that would give its possesor the ability to evolve but she doesnt know that and at the end she ends up fighting this 3 story monster on a platform surrounded by liquid hot magma.  now thats exciting and dangerous.  in this movie?  i never cared less for a charater.  in order to have a good action movie, you need to believe that the main character was actually in danger but tomb raider failed on that at every chance.  every action sequence was uninspired and the jokes are almost non existant.  laura's survant was the guy from red dwarf and his comedic talents were grossly under untilized.  in otherwords, wait for the cassett, i wouldnt even waste money on the dvd.
1,Disc won't play on my Blu Ray player, just keeps reading no Disc.
1,Only watched about first 15 or 20minutes. NOT funny just gross, and not in a bloody or gory way either.  Waste of rental fee.
1,What a disappointment!  The first Alice In Wonderland, directed by Tim Burton, was amazing.  So, we figured this one would be amazing too.  Uh, Tim Burton didn't direct this one, he was just one of the producers.  Someone named James Bobin directed this one.  It was sappy, the production was terrible, and whoever wrote the script must have been partially brain dead.  It was not a Tim Burton film, it was a typical Disney piece of yuck.  The first film was exciting, wonderfully directed, the type of movie you want to watch over and over again.  This one, we kept facepalming throughout the movie.  It was sooo predictable.  We were able to tell each other what was going to happen next, it was so Disneyfied.  Now, the casting was wonderful.  But they were given such a terrible script that even though all of them were wonderful actors, and tried their hardest to work with the script they had, it was still terrible.  We feel sorry for the actors who had to endure doing such a bad movie after doing the one directed by Tim Burton.  And what the......?  It was a partial Steampunk movie, and though I love Steampunk, it didn't work with this movie.
1,Mediocre acting, trite dialog, repetitive, no character development at all.  A big YAWN.
1,I really disliked this sequel. Despite having the same cast, it had none of scares. The acting was disappointing, what a disappointing drag!
1,Disappointed in this movie.
1,I am a very big fan of Columbo and have impersonated him many times in voiceover work.  However, the movies that were done after the series essentially ended had many "character ," flaws. These were things that went against the original character of Columbo. This series contains the worst Columbo ever made, UNDERCOVER. It has Columbo going undercover to solve a crime and rarely in his trademark trench coat. (The unique element of Columbo was that we already see the crime and we watch him solve it.) This one also has him giving out money for information, when did Columbo ever have plenty of cash to hand out! Some of the other episodes are okay but the William Shatner one shows off just how bad an actor he is. This is the only Columbo series I don't have or want in my collection.
1,It was so contrived and stupid.
1,I gave this 2 stars because I think Dominique Swan is right on - she was the most wonderful Lolita ever - and because as a gal who loves her rock n' rollers I thought this was going to be the greatest movie ever.  But, it failed to impress.  I was the Dominique Swan character, running after my favorite rock band because I was hopelessly in love with the lead singer and would stop at nothing for him.  I've had those nights standing out in the rain or arriving at a show that's canceled because I loved that band so much.  And my determination paid off!  *Patting myself on the back*		But the subplotting lead me to see this as a silly teen movie.  The lesbian aspect was tripe, but I realize that were I in her (Dominique's) position at her age I wouldn't understand something like that either.  The other characters were shallow, and it wasn't all that swift a story line otherwise.
1,What I found most disgusting about this film was that the whole point was that Bridget was finding herself as separate from needing a man.  From being the tragic girl desperately running after a man.  And then she ran barefooted in the rain after Colin Firth.  Almost as if she couldn't simply tell him the truth, see him for what he was and love that and had to debase herself as she had worked so hard to erase from her habits.  Thats when the film really was a let down for me.
1,Kind sorta weird.
1,Didn't even watch 10 minutes into it. Wasn't funny in the beginning so I didn't bother watching the rest of it.
1,Too much CGI, too little plot. A fascinating time in history disappointingly portrayed. Fight, fight, fight, hump, hump hump.
1,Oh what a disappointment these movies were. Well made but they jammed a 3 hour movie into 9 hours. I'm not a hard card Tolken fan or a "the book was so much better" kind of guy, but I wish I'd never seen these movies. It was better wondering what I'd missed then seeing the awful mess they made.
1,Was looking forward to the DVD release--but its a dud. I loved the Lone Ranger as a kid but the biggest problem with this movie (among many) is that actors/characters just take themselves WAY too seriously. When you read that all of Klinton Spilsbury's lines were dubbed (by the actor James Keach)and he never did another film after this you can see why. The Tonto character isn't bad but they had to throw in some 80's 'politically correct' dialogue into this film which kind of spoils the whole thing. To be fair how can you make an intersting hero out of the Lone Ranger in modern times, when he only wounds bad guys when he uses his gun? Watching this film you realize the reason a lot of movies take a long time to be released on DVD is they're lousey movies to begin with.
1,the true story based on the movie is to be admired.	I found the movie shallow.	A big disappointment.	Muddy plot.	too bad
1,I turned this off early because I know this formula all too well: the bad guys are depicted as so evil and vicious the viewer revels in seeing them violently killed in the end.  But I don't want to feel good about anyone's violent and brutal death.  What are we doing to ourselves as a society?  I watch movies hoping they will make me feel good about myself and life in general- there is none of that here!  I also strongly object to demonizing Native Americans like was done here.
1,bought as a Christmas gift,, not all of the discs will play,, have tried them in multiple payers and some of the disc just say error so they can not watch them.  lot of money to spend on an item that doen't work.
1,Worst movie ever
1,Did not like this movie
1,Sorry, Disney Home Video.  If you won't release DVDs with their appropriate widescreen aspect ratio, I won't be buying them.	"Follow Me, Boys" is a good film, but you've given it a very poor DVD release by including only a pan & scan version.	I would have thought you might have learned from your mistake with "The Absent-Minded Professor", which you went back and corrected.	At a minimum, you could release both pan & scan AND widescreen on the same DVD or DVD set...	PLEASE show some respect for your company's considerable film heritage.
1,Imagine Clint on qualuudes.  You will have it then.		Okay movie.  Caine is great as usual.  The female detective is good.  The rest is not very good cliche.  This movie is slow.  As in real SLOW.  Not bad what is there, you just think it takes forever for anything to happen, and when it does it doesn't amount to much.		Simply, don't waste your time.  There is more to life than this dribble.  Even staring at a wall or looking out a window.  Go out in the evening and stare at the night sky, much more interesting and enjoyable.
1,My taste in movies has changed in the 50+ years since To Kill a Mockingbird was released. I loved it then (I loved the book too) and have remembered it fondly ever since. But now it seems stilted and phony, even the stuff with the kids. Everybody declaims; nobody talks the way real people talk; and Gregory Peck is overbearing and pompous, stiff and smug and cold as an icepick.		It's a self-important and pretentious movie, overloaded with phony down-homeness and condescending socio-political moralizing - not entertaining or enlightening at all. I'm glad I borrowed it from the library instead of paying anything for it, even the few cents an online rental costs.
1,Boring!!  I really don't know why I continued to keep watching the movie except to find out if they were brother and sister.
1,Paul Thomas Anderson once again fashions an original and ambitious film of layers filled with challenging themes that, despite producing an occasional scene of brutal realism, fails to be that good. This two-hour and forty-minute story of one man's greedy ambition and his unwavering quest for wealth at whatever cost, reminded me of a Charles Dickens story where all the characters are caricatures--and that is not a good thing.		Daniel Plainview is an oilman who is seeking to make a fortune by finding a piece of real estate with a profitable oil well. He has no family except for a baby boy he adopts and quickly turns into his young prodigy. He is approached by a boy, Paul (played by Paul Dano), who tells him of a ranch where there is such an abundance of oil it is seeping out of the ground. This is all Daniel needs to hear before setting off to find it. When he arrives he quickly goes about buying up the ranch as well as all the surrounding land and then with a crew starts drilling. He does run into some confrontation with Eli (also played by Paul Dano) the brother of Paul. Eli realizes the oil is worth something and wants a share of the profit for his church which he is minister of. Daniel agrees to this, but once he strikes oil and starts raking in money, he completely ignores his deal with Eli as his true colors are shown and he slowly turns completely bitter to everyone around him.		This is one of those films that seems to easily garner many award nominations and termed "masterpiece!", but when you go see it you are left wondering if you saw the same film. There were simply too many flaws in this film to be even close to a masterpiece.		To start, as I said before there are moments of true brilliance and some scenes were so engrossing that you would hang on every motion and line of the characters only to be shut back out the moment the scene was over or the acting would become so ferocious that serious parts were almost humorous. PTA, the director, seems to have this style of pushing his actors almost into the territory of over-acting (as was the case of Tome Cruise and Julian Moore in Magnolia).		The production was nothing new or magnificent. The cinematography was mediocre almost annoying at parts as it showed close-ups for extended periods of time. The score was a "nail-on-chalkboard" type with every note out of tune and absolutely no melody just repetitive clicking, banging, or stringing contrasted against the silence of the plains.	For the story to be almost three hours long it was too focused on the main character, so that the supporting characters (none of who are women) appear more like those extras who just have a few lines before they head to the next studio. Because of this fact I felt the reality was taken out of it as Daniel Plainview seemed to exist in his own world were there was no society and the people surrounding him were so vacant of any character that everyone did as he said. Also the lack of a female character (supporting or main) was a big mistake.		I give this film points for trying to bring a message, but there were too many messages and themes that got mixed together so at the end I was wondering if it was trying to show the affects of greed, money cannot buy happiness, capitalism vs. religion, etc. All of these themes are good but when they are not made clear enough.		Lastly I feel that since it is not an entertaining film, it is more a character study filled with different themes to critically analyze (which I LOVE) the director should have chosen a different actor and story to illustrate those themes instead of oil drilling, Daniel-Day Lewis and nearly three hours of screen time (half of which has Daniel covered in oil beyond the point of recognition).
1,Way too much nudity for me. It was totally not necessary. You can get the idea without all the nudity. Too bad, because it was not a half bad story. Only watched 4 episodes and then " called it quits".
1,This pathetic excuse for a film COULD have MAYBE been interesting if it had been directed any better and if some of the cast had been changed.  It was so slow and so boring and so over-acted I could not even force myself to watch the end of it.  The plot was too stupid {even for a movie}, its too unbelievable that no one called the cops.  All the characters were cardboard cut-out actors pretending to act, even Murphy sucked.  If you think this is really a "noir" style film I feel sorry for you.  See some real noir to get an education on it. The film was like a bunch of teenagers getting themselves in stupid situation.  No one came off as an adult or a real personality, or dimensional or interesting. Nothing. Very annoying movie. Don't bother !
1,After seeing this movie on instant video, I am certainly glad I did not waste my money to see it at the theater.
1,Didn't realize it was a totally different movie than the one I had watched many times before. Weird ending.
1,Directed by modern day schlock-meister Dominic Sena, Season of the Witch stars Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman as crusade deserters that are reluctantly tasked with escorting a young girl (Claire Foy) to trial by monks after being accused of being a witch and bringing the plague to the land.  Their party also features a few other characters, and naturally, things don't go particularly well on their journey.  Let it first be said that Season of the Witch is nowhere near as bad as I thought it would be when I first caught wind of it.  Cage and Perlman are good in their roles, but the unbelievably predictable script (granted the bit of a twist towards the end is a surprise) and overly brisk pace don't help matters any.  For all its flaws, Season of the Witch isn't all that bad really, and warrants a look as a decent enough time-waster on a rainy afternoon.
1,I love the "Bourne" series- books and movies. Jeremy Renner is a great actor, however a "Bourne" movie just isn't the same (and doesn't meet my expectations) without Matt Damon. I purchased this movie because of the three previous movies in the "Bourne" series. I thought this movie was a waste of money and a waste of time. Oddly enough, they incorporated many actual scenes from previous movies in the series (not sure why) into this movie. Gave it two stars because I like action/ adventure movies. Maybe they should re-release it with a different title and alternate ending and then people (like me) will view it for what it is, not for what they hoped it would be.
1,I did not like it
1,Watching all 85 hours of this extended edition made me wish--desperately wish--that Peter Jackson would make my dreams come true and finally release a version that unfolds in real time! I want to pop the DVD in my machine and have it still going for years, decades even. I want to have to quit my job so I can devote all my time to watching these hobbity goofballs dance around and fight every waking minute of every day of my life.
1,Terrible.  Just terrible.  I normally like Patchy the Pirate, but he was terrible and should not have been in this film.  Even if he wasn't with him though, I would have given this a one star.  The plot and acting were terrible.  And some parts made no sense.  For example, Spongebob said he married Sandy, but it was just a play and even though his friends were in it, they were surprised when he said that.  This movie should never have been made.
1,Terrible acting.  Terrible movie. Scenes dont't seem to f;ow from frame to frame. Woul not recommend this movie to anybody.
1,This DVD is a big disappointment. I love the Beatle's and McCartney's music, but this DVD is not about the music, it is a quickly packaged product that shows more footage of the audience than of the performers onstage. Paul seems to have no quality standards, indeed, the songs are incomplete, interupted by interviews, poorly edited, and some are very weak renditions when compared to the original Beatles recordings. The concert is constantly interupted by extraneous footage of Paul riding around in a limo, etc. In a nutshell, I found this DVD to be an unwatchable piece of garbage.
1,Boring
1,I went into this thinking it would probably be a little bit better than what the reviews suggest. Just based on the nostalgia factor alone, I thought this movie would at least be a 7 out of 10 for me. Unfortunately this movie is extremely dull, boring, and has bad acting.		Megan Fox is terrible. It's like she took an online acting class that taught her how to say lines convincingly, but since it's only an online class, one very essential part of the lesson was missed: FACIAL EXPRESSIONS. She can speak (I guess), but she can't emote with her face.		Let's stop for a second, I'm going to quote a line from my review of the first Transformers movie from 2007, so you can see a theme here:		"...that girl couldn't act at all. Look at the moment(s) where she encounters the Transformers. Instead of looking shocked and in complete disbelief at seeing a several story tall live robot, she has the same expression you would have if you saw someone at work, who you previously could've sworn had the day off, but you see them at work anyway. She had that SAME subtle look."		I guess she took a couple more online acting classes since then, since she upgraded her facial expressions for this movie. This time, instead of looking like she's wondering if her co-worker had the day off, when she encounters unbelievable things in this movie that for anyone else would've been HORRIFIC, she looks like someone who's troubled at not having any vacation days left for the year, and so is pondering if they should just call off next Monday and hopefully not get in trouble.		The first time she meets the turtles, she doesn't look appropriately shocked. When she goes on that rooftop, she essentially sees a monster. That's what they are. For all intents and purposes, these turtles would appear to you as monsters. So she meets these talking green monsters, who are no shorter than 6'3'' , but she just has the SAME stupid expression of *mild concern*. She also didn't scream. At all. I don't care who you are, if you're a woman, meeting four very tall green MONSTERS with dangerous WEAPONS, you're going to scream. But not Megan Fox, she just has the face of someone who's sorry that a very distant cousin she never met passed away.		**Splinter looked weird in this movie. His eyes were a bit TOO rodent-like and realistic, those perfect black orbs that were his eyes. Very unsettling.		**I don't like the minimal amount of martial arts done in this movie. Most of the fight scenes consisted of the turtles brute forcing their way through their opponents. Off the top of my head, the only impressive shot was when Mikey did some jumping attack with his nunchucks and took out two people before he tripped or something. Everything else was just punches, and throwing bad guys against walls.		**When April is first "kidnapped" by the turtles, and had the mask put on her head, why wasn't she afraid?? Shouldn't she show a BIT of concern? Sure, she doesn't really see these monsters as necessarily a threat, but even then, you just had a mask put over your head by monsters, you should at the very least ask "WHERE ARE WE GOING?" All of Megan Fox's interactions with the turtles are just so SUBDUED, as if she's too cool to play it as a fidgety, scared person. As if she's too cool to open her eyes really wide to show fear, and move her body in jumpy ways to look like someone who's in disbelief at meeting a talking green MONSTER. When Leo put his arm around her, she didn't even care that much.		**I didn't like how in typical cartoon like fashion, all of April's co-workers mocked and ridiculed her story when she tried to explain herself. When does that EVER happen? Your close buddy might rib you, but when does an entire office laugh AT you, and not with you?? Play that out in your mind as you in your own workplace, and you'll see how ridiculous this movie trope is.		**When April called Whoopi Goldberg over to show her the "evidence," why didn't she show her the cellphone picture of the turtles??? Why START OFF the explanation with a pin up picture of a real turtle on the wall and point to it and say that's the vigilante? OF COURSE Whoopi Goldberg is not going to believe you!!!! She already laughed your story off the first time, what makes you think you seem any MORE credible now??		**I hated how the ending pretty much gave April a very important role in the bad guy's defeat. I would've rather seen the turtles be able to accomplish this on their own.		Ugh, I can't see this franchise getting any better. To this day, the only good live action turtles movie was the original, I gave that a 10 out of 10, because that actually had a purposeful narrative and non-offensive acting.
1,i don't like it
1,Not what I expected slow pace .
1,not the greatest I've seen.
1,pretty boring, to me it was wasted money
1,This is a one-joke/one-issue movie that isn't clever, nor does it cover any new ground, and the central charater is a whining irritating self-centered dullard who can't accept that someone he loves might not love him back. (It sure wasn't hard for me to imagine.)		The supporting characters are dull and lifeless, and one of them proposes to the central character.  I had difficulty caring.  I kept looking at the time to see whether it was almost finished.		I must say that if you're interested in this movie, please do yourself a favor and see "All Over The Guy."  It's in ENGLISH, it's cute, funny, intelligent, manages to avoid scenes of public urination, and it's much more enjoyable and affecting that this clunker. "Just One Time" is also noteworthy, supporting the same basic story line as this movie, and is also far superior in every way.		I wouldn't say completely avoid this as a rental, but it's certainly not a "keeper" (or even close) for me.
1,Watching  "American Hustle" is like going to an art gallery to view a new piece of art all the critics are drooling and raving over. I stand before this art "masterpiece", and see nothing but a twisted mess of rusted pipes, and thinking ,"HUH? I don't get it". That's  my reaction to this movie. I don't get it. Why are all the critics raving about it, and WHY is this movie winning all the awards? Loosely based on the Abscam stings of the late 70's and early 80's, I did think the acting was very good, and anyone who could dream up this screenplay deserves some type of recognition. For me, it was an overlong parade of Amy Adams displaying $8,000 worth of hair extensions, and clothing cut to her navel, Christian Bale with a pathetic comb over, Jeremy Renner with a ridiculous pompadour, and Bradley Cooper with his white man's afro. At least the "dos" gave me which gave me something to watch, because otherwise the movie was pointless, and actually, boring. My biggest thought watching it was, when is thing going to end? Reading about all the praise being heaped on this movie, proved to me, critics don't always know what they are talking about, so don't take their reviews as gospel. If this movie goes on to win the Oscar for best picture, over films so much better, it will be the greatest joke since 'Saving Private Ryan" lost.
1,A little crude in the "revenge movie" genre - perhaps too graphic and not clever enough to keepup with Mel Gibson or Liam Neeson's offerings in this category.
1,OK, this is a true case of getting what you paid for. It's a cheap release (which is good because I'm not sure the movie is worth more than ten bucks) but, be warned: NO extras and this is OBVIOUSLY a transfer from a VHS copy. The image is soft and the  colors are either washed out or muddy. Nothing worse than an old VHS tape though. It's also "letterboxed" but I'm not sure I believe it, it looks more like a matte put on after it was transfered to DVD.		The movie itself is just OK, it has a few strong moments, but this sort of thing has been done better (the excellent "Tarzan the Magnificent" from 1960 comes to mind or, strangely, Ridley Scott's "Alien" has a similar character dynamic). To it's credit, though, "Tough to Kill" is kind of early in the mercenary/war cycle that really hit its stride by the mid 80's when Golan Globus' Cannon films was churning out hundreds of Rambo knock-offs!		The plot is pretty standard but the characters are nastier (imagine if every character was Tom Berenger in "Platoon"!). The locations are under-used and the cinematography is just God-awful! Also, even though it's a classic 42nd street device, the use of racism in this film can be hard to take at times.		Still, despite everything I just wrote, I'm glad that these obscure, little Z-grade films get DVD releases. I'm a big fan of the film's lead, Luc Merenda, so I was happy to get this. If you like 70's Italian jungle films with miserable characters inflicting pain on everyone around them than this is for you!
1,The sound quality was not good for me.  I had trouble understanding many words.  Usually I can use the subtitle option but this DVD had no option for that.  Very disappointed.  The story was interesting, no real plot, just tracking the life of ain't erecting but troubled mans life.  The scenery was very beautiful.  The cast and acting excellent...but since I cannot understand about 50% of the dialog! I'm donating mine to Salvation Army with my next load.
1,Well, I guess I should not have had high expectations of this restored version, especially one created in Korea.  I was disappointed that none of the extras were translated into English.
1,"...as for "The Grace Card," I honestly don't know of anyone outside of the Christian faith who might be able to relate to it.

1,I have too much money and I need to burn it on something, OH I KNOW, WHAT IF STAR WARS WAS RE-ENACTED BY MY FAVORITE ZANY CHARACTERS FROM FAMBLY GAY! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA THAT'D BE SOOOOOO FUNNEH XD! Even though I watched Star Wars once when I was like 9, I just can't stop talking about Star Wars because 80's nostalgia is trendy!		Hey guys, remember when Stewie was Darth vader!?!?!?? See that's funny because he's like a small little baby but he's made to be this powerful entity, that's funny because proportions!		If you love Star Wars starring family guy than be sure to check out Seth Mcfarlene's Cavalcade of Cartoon Diarrhea, unfortunately it's not all copmletely centered around Star Wars so NEVERMIND SCREW IT everything sucks now the 80's were the best right guize?? Check out my ironically unironic Kanye West glasses, sooooooooooo 80's!!@!! xDDDD		LOL ok guys see you at the next LMFAO concert!
1,Oh Rob!  The "art film" aspect with this movie does not work IMO.  I was very seriously looking forward to this as I have found his other three movies great (all 5 star).  There are films that can do wanton and gratuitous violence that really work (pick a Troma film) but this doesn't quite match up with those.  I wish Laurie Strode would quit screaming! High points of movie:  Laurie's 300GT, Malcolm McDowell's greedy bookseller part, and Brad Dourif.  Other than that.....
1,Very slow to start and story line took 45 mins to start awful.
1,Didn't even watch the whole movie!
1,After hearing that this was the scariest movie of the year, I rented the video.  Thankfully, I didn't buy it.  As a fan of X-Files, I love anything that puts me on the edge of my seat. Well, trying hard to remain awake, I tried watching this movie to the end. I like to think I have above average intelligence but did any one else have trouble figuring this one out?  Who made the phone calls?  Who made the video; a girl who died twenty-five years ago (when the VCR hadn't been invented)?  This movie was very [weak].  If you enjoyed the X-Files, don't waste your time with this one.
1,TO AMAZON REVIEWERS: WHY IS THIS NOT THE "TOP CRITICAL REVIEW?" THE ONE YOU PUT IN THAT CATEGORY IS VERY WEAK. THIS REVIEW POINTS OUT SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH THE FILM NO OTHER REVIEWER SEEMS TO NOTICE.		I co-founded an organization that does anti-bias work in my community, and a friend who thought Id be interested in this DVD loaned it to me. When I grew up, history books made you think the only people who made any contributions to the world were white, so a DVD about black contributions was of interest. Unfortunately, the parts of the film that I was able to research, or already had knowledge of, left me uncertain about what in the film is accurate and what is not. I will give a few examples.		(41:02+ = starting at 41 min. & 2 sec. into the film) We know for a factall the cathedrals built in England, the island of England, were built by the Moors. There were Moors in England but the Moors were associated with the Middle Ages  centuries ago. We certainly don't think of Moors as being around in modern times. If you research English cathedrals on the web, you will a problem with the DVDs statement I just quoted. For example, that there are 30 cathedrals in the Providence of Canterbury that were built between 597AD and 1965AD  a period of over 1,000 years. The idea that Moors were still building cathedrals in England in 1965 is not correct. And I could not find evidence that they ever built any in England.		(52:10+) The Bonampak tribe, that was a group of aboriginal people living in the Mexico area. If you go down to Mexico and you look at these murals [they painted] you can see the Bonampak tribe clearly have African features, African nose, lips, hair. This is also easy for you to verify for yourself. First of all, I have visited Bonampak and seen its murals and to refer to Bonampak as an aboriginal tribe is not at all accurate. If you do any research on the ancient Mayans (and there are plenty of books and web sources) it will be obvious that Bonampak was a powerful Mayan city-state that was part of a great civilization. Yes, the Mayans had dark skin from living in the jungle, but they did not have African hair or facial features as is evident when you see todays descendants of the ancient people. If you look carefully at the murals shown in the film, you will see people with long hair  not with afros. A few dozen yards from the building with the Bonampak murals there is an 8th century sculpture of the king of Bonampak. He has long straight hair, a pointed nose, and thin lips and does not look anything like an African. (My photo of the carving of him is attached to this review.) Near the end of this segment on Bonampak (52:25), the film flashes the image of a little sculpture, apparently of an African, but that is not what the Bonampak Mayans looked like.		(15:04+) To support the idea that blacks were in ancient China the DVD shows a Buddhist painting with the image of a scary black figure holding a sword and surrounded by flames. In Buddhism, which I have studied, it is called a wrathful deity and is one of many Buddhist deities. Other deities include the White Tara and the Green Tara. Just as those last two don't relate to white people or green people, wrathful deities don't relate to black people. (This does not mean that there were not blacks in ancient China. It just means their use of the wrathful deity is not correct.)		(52:50-53:09+) Evidence of Africans in America  [author] Frank Josephfound coins with African heads on them. The coin they show on the screen as an example does not look like an African head but more likely a Roman head. The description of Josephs book on Amazon claims he found a cache of over 7,000 artifacts in an Illinois cave. In spite of racism in America, how could a find like this  that supposedly was examined by numerous experts - not be public knowledge? (One Amazon book reviewers comments: There is just a huge gap between the early narrative and the contents of the cave, which should be there if the writer planned to really link the Illinois cave contents to early Roman era immigrants fleeing North Africa. It is also not entirely honest to call these immigrants Africans, especially when the many figures in the book are of Romans.)		(26:47+) Leonardo DiVinci, Gallelo, all of them studied with African peoplewho taught Leonardo Di Vinci brain anatomy, who taught him about the airplane? It is possible these great Europeans studied with black tutors, I don't know. It would be true that the contributions the Moors made in math and science gave DiVinci and Gallelo a foundation to work from. But that does not mean a black tutor should be given credit for DiVincis brain research or invention of the airplane or that the tutor somehow gave him ideas about those things. Can it not be OK for blacks to influence DiVinci AND for him to have done brilliant things that are to his credit? I know a woman (who happens to be black) who went to Catholic school as a child. The nuns made an impact on her life in music and other areas. My friend has gone on to do incredible anti-racist work in her adult life. Even if the nuns gave her a belief in racial equality (and I do not know if they did or not), should the nuns be given full credit for all she has done and achieved with none of the credit going to her?		(19:25+) The DVD makes the point that Christianity copied the Resurrection and other aspects of its religion from the Egyptian gods. It is true the Egyptian religious system pre-dates Christianity. It is also true that Europeans were in Egypt before Christ. But why can Christianity not have some similar elements as the Egyptians without it being copied? Notably, the theme of resurrection existed in a number of the ancient worlds religions, myths, and legends. It was not just found in Egypt. (This is not to say that the idea of a white male God or a white Jesus does not have racist aspects, which the film points out. That is a different subject.)		(52:28+) The film shows Mayan temples. It contends that since Egyptians had pyramids (that pre-date the Mayan temples) the Mayans in Mexico and Central America must have been influenced by Africans. I have been to a number of ancient Mayan cities and rarely have I seen a temple that in any way would suggest the shape of a pyramid. In general, Mayan temples (which varied in their shapes at different Mayan cities) are totally different than Egyptian pyramids and relate to a completely different religions system. Why can it not be the case that Egyptians and Mayans developed their structures independently of each other?		(53:35+)Matsumutsa [spelling?] who became [the Aztec king] Montezumaso Montezuma was actually Matsumutsa  he was a Mali king who came over here with the flotilla of 200 ships of Abu Kahdi II [spelling?]. He [Abu Kahdi II] sent a flotilla of ships, 200 of them in 1306 and then again in 1311. Together they constituted 500 ships that sailed here from the west coast of Africa. There are a couple of problems with this statement. When people refer to Montezuma, they refer to Montezuma II, who was born in 1460. He was killed by Cortez in 1520  over 200 years after the film says Matsumuta came to Mexico and became Montezuma. (There was a Montezuma I who ruled the Aztecs, but he was born in 1398.) How could Matsumutsa have become Montezuma if Montezuma was not even born yet? If the producers are saying Matsumutsa is the Montezuma who confronted Cortez, this runs counter to all the Spanish chronicles regarding Montezuma and the Aztecs. The Spanish conquerors were white and racist, but it is unlikely they would omit something in their chronicles as sensational as an African king among the Aztecs. And why 200 ships (or does it total up to 500 present in Mexico at one time)? Think about this last question a minute. Columbus had 3 ships. Cortes had 11 ships for 600 soldiers and sailors. The entire Spanish Armada, which had ships collected from 8 countries, had 132 ships for 30,000 soldiers and sailors. What were west African kings doing sending 200 (or up to 500) ships? And how could some primitive Mexican costal city even receive that many? It is not impossible that Africans sailed to Mexico at some point, but it would not make sense to send 200 to 500 ships.		I could go on, but this gives an idea of some of the problems I found with this film. A basic point the movie tries to bring home is correct: Africans had great civilizations and great people throughout history. The Moors were very advanced and made many important contributions to Europeans. Their understanding of science, mathematics, and philosophy, part of which came from the Greeks, laid a foundation for Europe that was nothing less than revolutionary. But, again, because of the films errors it is hard to know what parts are correct and what parts are not. Otherwise,		(Amazon, incidentally, offers a great DVD on advanced civilizations in Africas past, aside from Egypt: Lost Kingdoms of Africa with black archaeologist Dr. Gus Casely-Hayford; $23, 2 DVDs. I have had difficulty finding books on the Moors in Spain that are authoritative and do not overly romanticize that era. Moorish Spain by Richard Fletcher [on Amazon] gives a short [175pages] but detailed history. While it can be a little boring to read, at times the author refers to the incredible contributions the Moors made. A more readable account of Spanish history during the rule of the Moors is The Ornament of the World: How Muslims, Jews, and Christians Created a Culture of Tolerance in Medieval Spain, by Maria Rosa Menocal, [also via Amazon] but it has only a few references to the Moors achievements outside of the world of literature and poetry.)
1,Wow...what a jumpy, choppy, uninteresting story.  There are many great actors in this movie that just seem lost.  Hunt does a great job with her character, but the movie isn't strong enough for it.  Broderick was just an extra it seemed, appearing in random segments.  Midler's performance was annoying. Poor Firth should have picked a better script as well.		Don't bother with this one.  This movie just proves the extreme excess that Hollywood pays for substandard quality.
1,I'm not sure why this movie was made. There was so much killing and bizarre crap going on, who could tell if any acting was going on?!!	Not at all worth watching.
1,I never thought the Coen Brothers could make a bad movie -but they exceeded my expectations.  What were they thinking?  Is this something that is filled with Hollywood insider "wink winks"?  if so I missed them.  I also think George Clooney should be a bit chagrinned at taking part in this Hindenburg like disaster.
1,I don't think this messy production was the fault of any of the actors.  A director seems to have been absent during filming.  Zooey Deschanel (who I have liked in other movies) spends most of her time looking, either puzzled or defiant.  She waves her arms a bit and opens her eyes really wide.  All of the actors seem to be trying very hard to stay in character but there is no chemistry between any of them.  On the other hand, the production is lavish and the special effects are very good for a television production.  For all the money that was spent on this mini-series, there should have been more coherence, a better script and a director who was present during shooting.
1,I purchased the wrong version
1,A bit strange for my tastes.  Had to will myself not to turn it off hoping for a better outcome.
1,The see-through underwear premise adds nothing to an inane story. Nothing is shown but a metal image of a solar burst. This is a case of a tease that fails to offer anything erotic or even slightly sexy. No titilating images . . . only cartoon-like ones. YO YO is probably a good title considering the content, or lack thereof.		Sorry. I very much like Asian films, particularly those with daring Asian cuties, but this one was a disappointment. Japan and South Korea have turned out much better product.
1,Liked:	(1) Tyler Perry and Ed Burns are good; Cicely Tyson is good except in one scene, which I'll mention in the Disliked section; Mathew Fox was good, and the actress who played Tyler Perry's wife gave one of the best death scene performances I've seen, she was very believable; the lady who played Tyler and Ed's partner was good; the leads were mostly fine.	(2) Strong scene when Cicely Tyson's character tried to convince Tyler Perry's character not to seek revenge - best scene in the script.  Both characters told the truth, which I liked.	Disliked:	(1) Script - poorly executed story.  This story was the first time I'd seen or heard of the character so I knew nothing about him, and the opening sequences of him chasing down a criminal, chastising his co-workers ("you're like 6th graders"), going to visit a prisoner, then home, seeing him with his child and his mom - it was all too little information and poorly told, too choppy and abrupt for me to get a sense of him.  First, criticizing his co-workers, the writer should have shown me how they failed.  All I saw was 3 officers chasing a male, who they told numerous times to halt, and the suspect failed to do so.  In real life, if 3 police officers are chasing you and tell you numerous times to halt, and you do not, you most likely will be shot, multiple times, and probably will die.  Most American citizens know this, even many children know, so adults do certainly.  When one officer character shot the suspect in the leg, and the Tyler Perry and Ed Burns characters didn't, I found it unbelievable.  The writer should have shown me on what grounds Tyler Perry's character had to criticize the other two; at least the female officer slowed the suspect down.	Why did Alex Cross go visit the convict - in his discussion with her he said he believed she was innocent and was taking the rap for a family member - if he believed it was so, and he wanted her released, why didn't the writer show him working toward that goal.  Why would a prisoner trust a police officer she never met before she got into trouble?  Why did Alex Cross care about her particularly?  The writer needed to show the connection between him and the prisoner.  Alex Cross is a police officer, it makes sense a convict would be suspicious of him, and the audience is given no information about his motives.  This is the beginning of the story and this lack of information is not good.  The writer is supposed to be helping the audience enter the story, helping us to understand, attach to (care about) Alex Cross; we need to know what makes him tick - and the writer needs to show us, not tell us.  If Alex is trying to free an innocent person we need to see him working towards that with other officials either before he met with the prisoner or after, and we need to be told why he believes she's innocent, and, why he cares.  He says she has no priors, and that it doesn't make sense for her to suddenly kill these people, whereas her uncle has a long rap sheet and would go to prison basically for the rest of his life.  Okay, but why does he think this about a person he doesn't know?  The audience needs to see something (witness some information) regarding how he reached this conclusion.  After all, killers kill for the first time every day.  What was unusual about this person, as a first time killer, that made her stand out?  People with no previous criminal record perform heinous acts everyday.  It is not unusual to read in the paper that a psychopath had no previous criminal record, so what about this particular character made Alex Cross suspect she was taking the fall.	The interaction between Alex Cross and his daughter is awkward, and should have been better written.	Cicely Tyson's character came on too strong in ordering her granddaughter upstairs to do her homework.  It would have been okay if the writer had shown the audience her previously ordering the child, and the kid disobeying, to perhaps impishly get out of doing her homework by playing piano for her father, who hadn't known about the previous order.  Something along those lines; anything that made sense.  All grandparents are not soft and cuddly, but when they are coming down on their grandchild even harsher than the parent, the writer needs to show why.  Tyler Perry's character didn't say "but mom, she was just showing me blah, blah, blah," which would have made sense, given his mom's harsh tone.  Poor writing; this is our lead, this is his family, this is our family, our attaching characters in the story, and we need to recognize their behavior, at the very least.	(2) Editing - poor, no good transitions, perhaps they were not shot.	(3) Music - didn't care for it.	(4) Villain - weakest link.  Mathew Fox was fine, this is criticism of the character, how he was written.	(a) An insane villain is not a good film villain, because a good film villain needs to scare the audience, and the audience knows that a mentally ill villain is seriously disadvantaged.  The audience needs a film villain who is competent, intelligent, capable, and at the top of his/her game.  A mentally ill villain simply is not at the top of their game, no matter how brilliant they are, and an audience knows it.  Mental illness is a handicap; a film villain needs to be viewed by the audience as a predator, a successful predator; she/he can be human, they need not be superman/woman, but they need a high skill set, and they need to impress the audience.  Mental illness, no matter how scary in a film, also generates pity.  You want your audience to fear the film villain, not pity him/her.  A mentally ill villain is at some level, not in control of their actions - when a writer writes their villain as mentally ill, presenting him that way to the audience, the audience knows that person is not in total control of their behaviors, they are sick, and their illness is not their fault. The villain needs to be totally in control of themselves, totally responsible for their behavior - they do what they want to do and don't care about the cost to anyone else.  A sick film villain is not competent to assess the cost.	(b) High end mercenary - it's totally unbelievable that a high end mercenary would get so upset that Alex Cross could begin to anticipate his behavior, and almost catch him (at the building where his German target worked), that he would seek to avenge himself on Alex Cross, his team and their families.  I know no high end mercenaries, but think, you are a gun for hire, one of the best in the world, how do you get that way.  How is it you can charge what you want, and rich people can find you, though you're not listed in the phone book.  You must be intelligent, highly skilled at killing people, including knowing all kinds of machines to help you do that job (guns, just to name the obvious), and have lots of other technical knowledge about a wide range of subjects.  If you are a high end mercenary, it's doubtful that you are spiteful and stupid when it comes to your work.  You would probably be highly focused, and may not even enjoy killing, but simply be good at it and have no moral aversion to it.  You would not be a successful high end merc by going after police officers and their families.  Anyone physically attacking police officers and their families in retaliation against officers performing their jobs, are in effect, attacking the state, and attacking the state means you have declared war on the state - you have become a terrorist and the full force of national and international policing officials would be brought to bear against you.  So, it is obvious, that no high end merc would do this, certainly not in the context this film sets up.  If the Mathew Fox character as a high end merc found that his moves were being anticipated by the local law, what he would have done is completed his mission as soon as he possibly could, and then left.  He certainly would not have targeted the officers or their families, what professional needs that heat.  If, by some stretch, the merc became fascinated with the Alex Cross character, he might have followed Alex's future cases from afar.  At the most, he/she would have used the close call with Alex as a learning tool, as a professional is always striving to get better.  In the real world there are high end mercs, yet you never hear about them taking out police officers and their families.  High end mercs, high end assassins, wouldn't do this type of work (attack local police), they're on a whole other level; this movie merc is just poor storytelling.  If the writer needed the merc to fixate on Alex Cross, the merc could have had a loved one that got in the way and who Alex and his team took out.  That would have better explained the merc's interest in Alex, but no merc would believably take a loved one on a job, so the writer would have to show how Alex and his team's investigation lead them to someone the merc cared about, that may have worked.  But a professional assassin at the top of her/his game, and on a paying job, would not attack the investigating officers and their families, story just not believable as presented.	(5) Police officers as law breakers - the writer spent more time showing how Alex Cross became a criminal (breaking into the evidence room and assaulting the officer on duty, conspiring with the criminal who allowed his niece to take the fall for him, to break the law by giving him the weapons used in the criminal's murder of others, framing the villain who hired the merc in the first place, who Alex Cross blamed for ultimately killing his wife, assaulting the chemist who created the date rape drugs), than he did showing why Alex Cross was superb at his job; the writer told the audience Alex Cross was good, but he didn't show us Alex's process, how he reached his conclusions.  We were told Alex Cross is clever (Ed Burns character told his girlfriend that Alex could tell you what you ate for breakfast), but the audience didn't get to experience it for ourselves; we were told it, we weren't shown it.	I think writers should be careful about having heros in a story breaking the law with no negative repercussions for them, especially characters charged with upholding the law.  Unfortunately we know that our legal institutions are, like us, not perfect, and again unfortunately, our institutions reflect the racism and sexism of our society in many ways.  Also unfortunately times are about to get tougher for many Americans, especially the poorer of us, as petroleum prices are expected to begin rising significantly in the next 5, 10 years (see post carbon institute.com), and petroleum is used in the manufacture of nearly everything we eat and the items we use.  Prices will rise and the poor will become even more stressed, and some with undiagnosed mental illnesses, trapped by increasing prices, and unable to leave emotionally untenable, but paying jobs, may snap - we may see more people snap - and we don't need to see film stories with law officers matter of factly breaking the law, because they want to, and getting what they want with no repercussions; it may help a sick audience member, already angry and frustrated with their life, make an officer a target.  I am not saying don't show police corruption in film, I am saying writers should consider the world in which they are writing - if they want to show officers breaking the law, show that, but show them paying for the error of their ways, like an ordinary citizen would.  Don't let them be the hero, which in our culture has usually been the morally correct character, and the criminal getting away with crime too; if they are the hero, and they successfully break the law in your film, consider what you are suggesting to the audience.  Stories are not just stories; they help the culture know who we are; what laws and rules we share.  Over the next 10 or 20 years, this country, and the world, will be moving into a very different future than the one experienced in the recent past, because oil in the ground, but harder to access, will cost more.  Short term the world and the majority of us will have our income contract, and it will be painful.  I believe governments already know this.  Police officers, not perfect, but necessary enforcers of the law.  It is helpful to have at least the illusion of law for us ordinary folk.  I think writers should know and understand that even more challenging times are coming; be careful who you criminalize, and think very carefully about who they are in the story and in the real world, and how their behavior may be perceived by the audience.  In this story, Alex Cross began the film as a police officer who would not even shoot a fleeing suspect, and who visited a convicted felon in prison; he ended the story as a criminal himself, unconvicted and unpunished by the story's authorities, but clearly shown to be a criminal to the audience.  Is the writer saying that Alex Cross' behavior is okay because he is a police officer, and that police officers are above the law?  Alex Cross is the story hero, there is no other hero, so it makes sense for the audience to conclude that is what the writer is saying.  In an increasingly difficult world more people will be stressed, and I don't think it wise to show police officers as heros above the law; they can be heros, but within the law.  Telling a story this way may protect an officer from a person who has gone off the rails, and with increased stress on the world, more people may become ill who might have otherwise been able to cope in better times.  I am not the story police, just my opinion.	Rate story - one star for acting, one star for filmmaking team's effort.
1,Everybody dies
1,should be the name of this movie, as a huge frankie lymon fan, this movie really does him an injustice.  there's barely no mention of his childhood, his rise to success, talent and of course his passing.  instead, you just see 3 greedy golddiggers who sue his estate many years after he died and it's obvious they didn't have much remorse for him.  also, i'm not buying that all 3 women were legally married to him all around the same time, considering the age differences of them and frankie.  i think it's possible that they knew and possibly dated frankie, but he didn't live very long, and if they're truthful, why didn't they sue his estate in the late 60s-70s if they were entitled to this money?  i hope someone someday will do a factual and respectful documentary of his life instead of using his music and song title to show 3 greedy women fighting over his money and who probably didn't even attend his funeral. overall, decent movie about golddiggers....but not worthy of lymon's true talent and character.  if you love doo wop, buy his cds instead, i love 'em!!  and no golddiggers on there!!
1,AVENGERS could have been great.  But no.  Totally crap.  The worst script ever devised completely wasting the amazing talents of Thurman, Finnes and Connery!  Scenes are chewed!  Lines are tossed!  Catsuits are worn!  Bowlers are thrown!  The actors appear to be dazed in the delivery of ridiculous lines of dialog.  Is it a comedy?  Is it a drama? Is it slapstick? Who knows? certainly not the director.		Do yourself a favor and watch the original series.		Then if you need something more interesting that sill holds up after all these years check out 'The Prisoner'which is still ahead of it's time.  http://www.amazon.com/Prisoner-Complete-Blu-ray-Patrick-McGoohan/dp/B002C68WOG/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&ie=UTF8&qid=1398450685&sr=1-1&keywords=the+prisoner
1,Too much slapstick comedy for my tastes. Not a serious show, but funny in some parts and really stupid in others. I can't recommend it for adults, it's too dumb, yet it's not really suitable for children. That people really like it is a sad commentary on what is available. By the way, this is my last review since there is no point wasting words that accomplish nothing. Thanks, but no thanks.
1,"The Life After Death Project" is a fascinating documentary in which filmmaker Paul Davids conducts an investigation of a case of after-death communication with science-fiction luminary and one-time editor of "Famous Monsters of Filmland" magazine Forrest J. Ackerman. Ackerman was a skeptic about life after death, but promised close friends that if it turned out he was wrong, he would try to "drop them a line" from the Other Side. Featured are authors Richard Matheson, Whitley Strieber, and Dannion Brinkley, along with science professors and three mediums.		The two-disc set also includes the film's sequel, "Life After Death Project 2: Personal Encounters," which features first-person accounts of encounters with life after death from archaeologists, physicists, a retired colonel, a librarian, clinical psychologist, sales executive, publisher and doctors and nurses who've worked with hundreds of dying patients. They report seeing souls leaving the body at death, angelic beings, spirit entities, golden orbs, physical manifestations, and more. It includes updates on the continuing sage of Forrest J. Ackerman.		The movie attempts to make its case that there is an afterlife, but succeeds only in relying on an assortment of talking heads -- some charlatans, others basing their speculation on testimony of those who've had close flirtations with death. After all is said and done, the film is hardly convincing and not worth the time to watch it.		There are five bonus featurettes.
1,Some franchises should just know when it's time to hang it up once and for all.  Hannibal Rising is a prequel to everything else we've seen our favorite cannibal in, and upon viewing it you may wish you hadn't.  If you read Thomas Harris' Hannibal novel, then you'll probably remember the brief glimpse of backstory given to Hannibal Lecter's (Gaspard Ulliel) origin, of which this prequel capatilizes on.  As we witness the atrocities performed on Lecter and his family, we see the boy grow towards adulthood with revenge on his mind, and who can blame him really?  What kills Hannibal Rising is that Lecter isn't frightening at all throughout the film.  What helped make Silence of the Lambs so good, and to a degree Red Dragon (I wasn't fond of Ridley Scott's Hannibal at all) is that Lecter was a frightening, and brilliant, psychopath who became one of the most memorable screen villians of all time.  Here, he's relegated to a sympathetic state, and it doesn't work.  Not to mention that to say that Gaspard Ulliel doesn't fit the role is saying it lightly, and the rest of an otherwise solid cast (including Gong Li, Kevin McKidd, and Dominic West) are pretty much wasted in their roles.  Peter Webber's direction, while stylish, is ultimately empty, and a majority of the film plays out like an overlong slasher.  While there are a good amount of creepy moments and some solid, grisly effects, Hannibal Rising is a dud, and hopefully, the means to an end for a franchise that has been picked clean.
1,SLOW! Editing chaotic. Beautiful nature scenery. I bet the book was better.
1,Did not realize this was a kids movie. Probably entertaining for young people but didn't finish watching as it was boring
1,I was unfortunate enough to watch this movie on tv. While the general events followed history, little else did. The band of "heroes" and "villains" was laughably full of cliche's of this generally one sided attempt to show the event's of the Mexican American war. As the the saying goes, the winner of wars writes the history. This is a prime example.
1,It was slow and couldn't wait to see what the story was about. It seemed to be a low budget James Bond show.
1,It's ok but gets repetitive and bogged down in lack of imagination.  Jump out of the woods, shoot the enemy, back to camp, jump out of the woods, shoot the enemy, back to camp.  Move the camp, understandable camp discomfort - repeat.  True story and for that reason maybe you want to see it, but the acting is weak and seldom convincing.
1,I hated the first 43 minutes of this because it illustrates marital cheating, street drug use, laughing approval of street drug use and zombified students.  It's easy to say "well, it's just a movie," but many of the early scenes will look like fun to nave people who fail to realize their lives could easily be ruined by what sometimes results from observing that these activities look like fun.  At the 43-minute mark I didn't car how good the ending would be.  I could not stomach more and turned it off.
1,well at least it put me to sleep
1,"Smart Money" is a strange movie, to say the least. It was made right after Edward G Robinson's breakout performance as Rico in "Little Caesar" (The G was for Goldenberg, his real name), and Warner Brothers was anxious to spin off another crime film with Robinson asap. But Robinson was not at all like Rico nor was he interested in making a career as a tough guy, so he demanded changes in the script of "Smart Money" to soften his image. The result is a script that shows Nick the Barber (Robinson's character) alternately being sweet and sour, friendly and psychopathic. Robinson occasionally falls into the "Yeah, that's right sister" accent that he used so forcefully in "Little Caesar" but then reverts to a caring sweet small town barber.		Robinson's character is not the only strange part of this film. Early on a woman comes to him and whispers in his ear and Nick hands her $100 bill (making one wonder how a small town barber has a $100 bill in his wallet). She walks up the street and hands the bill to Boris Karloff (an uncredited role even though he speaks several lines) who is lurking in the shadows (where else?), and then Karloff shows up in the back room of the barber shop where Nick and his friends are playing craps.  Nick recognizes the $100 bill, forces Karloff to bet the entire sum, and then kicks him out when he loses. The two scenes make no sense and suggest that several more scenes were cut, which is possible when you consider "Smart Money" runs longer than "Little Caesar".		If these features aren't strange enough, we have Jimmy Cagney playing a supporting role. Cagney shot "Smart Money" while he was shooting "Public Enemy" and often had to run between the two sets (both were produced at Warners). Once "Public Enemy" came out, a few months after "Smart Money" debuted, Cagney became a major star and would never appear as a supporting actor again. In fact, even while "Smart Money" was being made, the studio knew that Cagney was going to be a huge hit, so they enlarged his part, but they didn't do it seamlessly, so Cagney seems to pop in and out of the film.		BTW - the guy who helps Cagney hold up the poker game is Donald Cook, the actor who played Cagney's brother, Mike Powers, in "Public Enemy". Cook's role goes uncredited.		As a historical film, we have Edward G Robinson, James Cagney, and Boris Karloff at the very starts of their careers ("Frankenstein" would be released about the same time as "Public Enemy"), all together in the same scene. Other than this, however, the film tends to be tedious. The "kinder, gentler" gangster film unless supporting a comedy usually falls flat, and given such contemporaneous films as "Scarface", "Little Caesar", and "Public Enemy", "Smart Money" has tended to be ignored.
1,It's always nice to see Willem Dafoe and Matt Dillon, but this movie just isn't very good---loved all the facial hair though!
1,This is the same 8 disk version of Carol's Crack-Ups that is sold at Costco for $28.99. Why pay nearly $50?
1,James Franco is my favorite young actor. But this movie is a waste of his talents. It is the biggest piece of garbage I have ever seen. I can't imagine how or why it made money. It is absolute rubbish---zero plot and utterly misogynistic.  It is offensive in every way. It has no script, it has no plot, it has no real cinematography.		This movie presents all young women as slutty and all black males as thugs and drug dealers.  Besides Piranha 2, it is the worst movie I've ever seen. Do NOT believe the 5-star reviews claiming that all the low reviews are the result of "not understanding the subtle genius" of this movie. That's utter nonsense. I'm a student of cinema, I go to indie movie houses all the time, and this film has no redeeming creative qualities.		And Franco's alleged "brilliant" performance?  No chance. They cornrow his hair, they laquer his teeth, they stick a pair of 70s shades on his face, they dress him gangsta, they give him cheap, silly dialogue. But what makes Franco so appealing is that he doesn't need all that stuff; his expressive face exudes a powerful inner pain and torment far beyond his years. Heck, he's at his best in a pair of ratty jeans and a black t-shirt, not disguised as some LA rapper.		The 4 female leads aren't in Franco's acting league. But they are not bad actresses. They do have potential that is never explored here. I don't think you ever see them not in bikinis, which means the director had no faith in their acting abilities.		The beach footage shows acres of bikini-clad women, with a sprinkling of men. Yeah, get real. Here's what spring break is really like: 10 drunken guys to every girl and if you're lucky enough to have a girl talk to you, it's because she wants to soak you for free booze.		Final word? This is a Frankie Avalon/Annette Funicello beach movie if it were directed by serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer.
1,I wasn't impressed by this biopic.  It just seemed really clumsy and pointless.  I'm guessing it was a pretty low-budget project and most of it just seems like a half-step above something done by a film school student.  I *love* Barry Williams' book, which has a great narrative and gives some nice blow-by-blow accounts of some tumultuous things that went on behind the camera for five years.  The highlight of Williams' book is the details of the feuding between Sherwood Schwartz and Robert Reed - the film just barely touches on this.  In the lead as Barry, Adam Brody does as well as can be expected.  But there is absolutely zero chemistry between him and the actress who played Maureen McCormick, as opposed to the real-life magnetism between Barry and Maureen that lasted for a while.  Incidentally, the actress who played Maureen was a dog - whereas Maureen (and Christine Taylor, a dead-ringer for her in the BB Movie) was and still is a sizzling hot babe...  A good portion of the film focuses on how the kids got moved into a musical career with their BB stage act, and getting an agent to represent them.  The beginning and ending are extremely corny - with Williams entering the Paramount Studios lot while having conversations with a cabbie and a network exec on the lot about "if Greg and Marcia ever...did anything".  If you want the real thing, just read Barry's book instead, it tells the whole story very well - and so vividly that you can almost feel like you were there.  This DVD....don't waste your time or money.
1,The reviews I read before purchasing this were very vague and now I understand why - The plot is weak and unoriginal. There is something happening at the house across the street - and it is something we have definitely seen before in everything from books, horror movies, to lifetime movies. The main character is severely depressed and angry and we don't learn the reason why until the end of the film. This makes it difficult to sympathize with her/understand her reasoning behind her actions. I would have offered up her story sooner in the movie to help us build a connection with her. Since everything is so vague for the first half of the movie, you really have to motivate yourself to keep watching. I would definitely save your money and wait until this becomes available on Prime.
1,A lot of talking and very little action. Thus, I quit watching half-way through. James Coburn is miscast and not believable as a German. Released in 1977. Better World War 2 action films are: "Enemy at the Gates" about Stalingrad with Rachel Weisz; "Panfilov's 28" about Russian soldiers holding a trench line against German tanks with improvised weapons. "1945" about the Estonians drafted into both the German and Russian armies and forced to fight each other.
1,I found this to b a short story of more blood and pathetic violence then needed. Don't get me wrong i love shoot em up movies , this one just bored me to death.
1,The movie just wasn't funny. Melissa McCarthy's epiphanies didn't ring true. Peter Dinklage was completely wasted.
1,cheaply made, poorly acted. people appear & disappear with no rhyme or reason.	stilted dialogue. i am rarely unable to finish a flick. i made it to the last 30 minutes or so. this was exactly one badly exploded blood bag too many.
1,I am surprised. This is probably the worst movie I ever watched. It is one of those "it can't be this bad, let's give it another 5 minutes". Didn't get better.
1,Season 6 review. First four seasons are good, but then the absolute decline starts. The characters get a little weirder, but that is because they have run out of ideas. This transition from year to year is like seeing everything through Karen's eyes. It is all fun in the beginning and you like Hank. However, as the seasons wear on, you just start getting tired of what a total screw up he is and it all gets very old.
1,B
1,Unnecessary, graphic nudity of Reese Witherspoon and unnecessary scenes of Reese having graphic sexual-intercourse attack the hearts of men and boys; soliciting men and boys to lust, and leaving an image in their minds forever. Reese, the feminist, clearly does not care about harming men and boys, and rejects responsibility and accountability; at least until she stands before God to give an account.		Why does Reese Witherspoon bother going to Catholic church when her actions are contrary to the Bible; contrary to God's ways; contrary to the moral-values she claims to promote; contrary to caring about men and boys. Imprinting the hearts of men and boys with graphic nudity and sex is contrary to God's ways. Reese claims to be outspoken, but has only been outspoken for immorality and has never been outspoken for Jesus. This film is a true story. The film dismisses the character's use of heroin and promiscuous-sex with acquaintances as a lot of fun and harmless. Reese was a vanity producer of this film in name only. Others are influencing her for the worse; rather than her ever being a positive influence of morality upon others.		Only some of the locations were on the Pacific Crest Trail. The film filmed elsewhere to save money. This film should have been all about the beauty of the Pacific Crest Trail; friendships made on the trail; positive experiences; and what to carry and how to make the trek a good one. Even without the graphic nudity and graphic sexual-intercourse; this film would be no more than 3-stars. A pretty woman hiking the trail alone is foolish, because of sexual-predators and robbers; another thing this film whitewashes over. Hiking the 2,600-mile trail; through deserts without water and over 13,000-foot snow-capped peaks is a great accomplishment. I bought this film for that adventure, but was not inspired.		There is some good scenery on location. Reese makes a few friends on the trail and has some experiences. The hike did not bring the character any closer to God, but was only a lucrative book deal and movie deal. I'm throwing it out.
1,As much as I enjoy Will Ferrell in some of his movies and routines this is not one of them. It's slow predictable and stupid. To me much of this is in poor taste.
1,There was no backstory - no character development - basically a live action cartoon with shallow players. The Enders books are worth reading, but this movie version did not do justice to the original.
1,This film does not do justice to Orwell's novel whatsoever.	The acting performances are mediocre and passionless, there is no emotional connection, and the way the movie handled scenes from the book seemed curiously amateurish. This feels like a dated and cheap made for TV movie, a total waste of time.		Maybe someday in the future a film adaptation of the novel will be done right, here's hoping for that day!
1,A movie which explores the absurdity of many art/independent films runs the risk of making the film itself absurd. The idea of casting A.S. as the lead may have been part of the joke but doesn't work for a second. The lack of dialogue and the uninspired performances again push the limits of parody, making this seem like a foreign film that may be played over and over again as torture in your most dreaded afterlife, make their point quickly but again - the lack of humor makes this an exercize only in self torture. The lack of a screenplay (which may or may not be all improvised - it isn't known) also strangely creates a sense of the most pretentious art film but there's no substance in the excercize - just a one-note joke. "Plot points" if you can call them that in this films show complete disregard for storytelling, a loss for story is also filled up with several minutes of color effects - apparently to get the movie to 90 minutes (the first time it did get some laughs, after that it gets old).	All in all it shows the humor in pretention but at the same time I think it could have been a 5 minute Saturday Night Live skit with a much stronger affect. Was P.T.A. making fun of bad art films or finding the humor in the classic ones? A good joke shouldn't take an hour and a half. Skip it - or watch it while you're doing chores or something. Paul Thomas Anderson is simply the most overrated and misplaced person in the film industry (Kevin Smith is a close 2nd but at least less money gets dumped into his projects). A shame and a waste of film, time and energy when there are so many other artists out there struggling to have their voice be heard. Definitely one of the worst films I've seen in my 34 years of watching movies. A classic example of why I get discouraged for the future of American film.
1,Didn't like this movie at all. Found it grim
1,Am a big fan of Babylon 5 series and the books.	Crusade starts off with one of the strongest story lines ever,	Earth has been infected with a plauge, everyone will be dead in 5 years, captain Gideon here's a ship and a crew - go out and find a cure before its too late!  Wow!  great start.		But episode 1 collapses 2/3rds of the way through starting with a lame puff ball fight with some Drakh soldiers and an even more odd silent space battle.	Episodes 2-8 are barely watchable.  Just filler, no furthering of plot line.		I stopped after 8 episodes and traded the set at the used DVD store for a copy of the new THING.
1,This is a mockumentary on the zombie community. In many ways it is a parody on the gay community. Unfortunately in order to capture the feel of a real documentary, the movie is very boring.		The low budget made for very few special effects or zombie make-up. The zombies they follow live boring if not pathetic lives. The real action in the movie starts at a festival called "live dead" which reminded me of a Grateful Dead parking lot. At this point the movie is well past the half way point. Feel free to tell people the surprise ending.
1,For an MI episode the plot was right out of a Steven Segal movie from 1996.  As Maxwell Smart might say "the old steal the nukes from the former Soviet Union" scenario.		If you ignore that the main premise has totally been done a gazillion times the action, thrills and cast interaction keep your attention.		One thing lacking was the jaw dropping final chase sequence, but the actors somehow made up for it.  This almost might make a better TV series than a movie franchise if you could get them to reprise their roles on the small screen.
1,I found it hard to relate to the characters. I do not think I would be interested in seeing anymore of this series.
1,Another over hyped anime.  Appears to have been made on too much of a budget.
1,Cannot recommend this to anyone.
1,Two scientists engaged in a dna splicing program decide to go the extra step by secretly adding some human genetics to the monstrous melange. Disaster ensues... but the plot takes a turn for the worse as well.		This movie can't decide what it wants to be... part science fiction, part horror, part family drama, part social commentary. It collapses under its own weight from the writers trying to shoe-horn every little bit of scrap into it. They seem to think this is something "profound" in the way of being a self-perceived indictment of science playing God, but it just comes off as being pretentious and scatterbrained.		The film never engaged me and is ultimately forgettable, but for now it's enough in my memory to leave a lingering aftertaste of annoyance. I've seen worse things (which is why I'll give it 2 stars) but there's no question there's better things out there to waste an evening on.
1,Give me something not redundant on what could be a fascinating subject and I won't turn and run. Underdeveloped characters left me with a sense of longing for this film to accomplish its goal of intelligent life somewhere in the universe.
1,My first Altman was Nashville (1975), until today a five star, like some of his later hits - The Player (1992), Short Cuts (1993) and Prt--porter (1994). Fool for Love is like a poor country version of Tennessee Williams' Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (Richard Brooks, 1958), only that the main characters are not played by Elizabeth Taylor, Paul Newman and Burl Ives. Kim Basinger tries hard to get some logic into her part, but literally collapses against an incoherent, rather empty script. Lots of unmotivated violence. Nothing to write home about!
1,The trailer looked promising, but the product delivered only disappointment.		The trailer doesn't show us a whole lot in terms of estimating what kind of horror this will be.  Really, we see just enough to know that the acting isn't awful (actually it looks quite good...for a horror flick) and the production value is competitive.  I'll go so far as to say that an unusually good job was done building the plot up to the "extreme tourism" trip to Chernobyl.  I liked the characters (enough, at least) and enjoyed a few clever, light-hearted laughs.  Jonathan Sadowski  is charmingly funny and he brings that to the screen here early in the movie.  Characters like his are typically fun to watch things hit the fan.  Makes me think of Grave Encounters (2011), where the jokester finds himself freaking out as he learns "it's not a joke."  This flick also features Nathan Phillips, Ingrid Bols Berdal, Olivia Dudley, and Jesse McCartney.		Though a bit prepackaged--a la Wrong Turn past the Cabin in the Woods where the Hills Have Eyes--the premise worked and the creepy setting created the opportunity for some great scenes.  Just the opportunity, though.  While the set design worked, the crux of the movie (i.e., the anthropophagous mutants), was poorly delivered.  Sadly, there are really no special effects at all in this movie.  That is not to say they are bad, but that the way the "action" and "horror" are presented no effects are really necessary.  Now, horror movies can vary.  Depending on the style they may not need any CGI or fake blood (e.g., Paranormal Activity had minimal FX).  Contrarily, movies in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre vein rely heavily on excellent make-up artists and mutant movies need solid mutant concepts that keep us from saying "hey that's just like in that other movie with that guy in it that came out last year."  Well, this was a mutant movie, and no one in the audience could pick one of these mutants out of a line up after seeing this movie.  That's how little you see, and the only blood/guts/whathaveyou is post-attack.  Bummer.		Producer Oren Peli (Paranormal Activity director/producer; PA 2 and PA 3 producer) has a great mind for creepy suspense.  I think he was going for a monsters-driven quite creeper; the reason we never really see more than blurry silhouettes of the flesh-eating antagonists.  This general mystery tactic worked in Insidious (2010), when the creature was some other-worldly specter.  But this movie was advertised as suggestive of The Hills Have Eyes in an abandoned fallout city.  Maybe there was a way to make this work, but Peli didn't find it.		I haven't really addressed the plot...there's not much to say that you don't get from watching the trailer.  Some likeable 20-somethings on a European vacation decide to take an extreme tourism excursion to a village in sight the Ukrainian power plant on record as having the worst "bad day" ever.  When they try to leave the car doesn't start.  Then they start dying one by one--and you never see it happen!  The escape strategy never gets anyway, the characters (not surprisingly) don't develop beyond a few cheap lines of dialogue, and there's an inexplicably stupid not-so-twisty ending.		WHAT TO WATCH INSTEAD?  Grave Encounters, the Paranormal Activity series and White Noise deliver the creepy suspense desired in this flick.  For hungry mutant redneck whatevers aim for The Cabin in the Woods, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre series or Wrong Turn.  For suspense and blood and guts galore: Final Destination 5.
1,I'm disappointed with this "Super Bowl XLIII" DVD set.  Sure, it contains four football games as advertised, but that's about all the good I can say about it.  In almost every way this set is inferior to the "<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Pittsburgh-Steelers-Road-to-Super-Bowl-XL-Post-Season-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000FTCLTO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Pittsburgh Steelers - Road to Super Bowl XL (Post-Season Collector's Edition)</a>" DVD box set.		The video quality is quite similar and almost exact.  However, the video presentation seems quite rushed on the XLIII set, as if the on-field action was cut even shorter than the XL set.  (The DVD menus are "flashier" this time around, although you look at them for about three seconds.)		The XLIII audio track features the inferior television commentary as opposed to the superior radio commentary used for the XL set.  The XLIII set also uses an audio track that seems to have been mixed in a studio with a four-year-old child constantly pushing buttons.  The audio track is very uneven and distractingly so. (The crowd noise keeps rising and falling although nothing is happening on-screen and it occurs too often to be replays on the "Jumbotron".)  BOTH sets, XL and XLIII, feature English-only subtitles.  (But considering the target audience, I'm not surprised.)		The XLIII set is without any extras.  NO extras.  None.  Zilch.  Zip.  Nada.  This is a major disappointment.  The XL set had one documentary per disc.		The packaging is different and less eco-friendly.  However, I personally prefer the hard plastic XLIII packaging to the cardboard XL packaging for long-lasting presentation.		Here's the short version:		Super Bowl XL (40) set	VIDEO - DVD	AUDIO - Radio commentary	EXTRA - One documentary per disc	PACKG - Cardboard		Super Bowl XLIII (43) set	VIDEO - DVD	AUDIO - TV commentary	EXTRA - None	PACKG - Plastic		While I believe that the video quality of the XLIII set "MAY" be better due to the fact that a Blu-Ray version was produced, it's imperceptible on DVD.  I also believe the extras were cut to make room on the discs for this imaginary "improved video quality".  The audio commentary difference is one purely of preference and is obviously inferior to me.  The omitted extras are a disappointment.		Aside from having four more football games on DVD, this set is almost a WASTE OF MONEY.  (A DVR-version would be better, at least then I'd have the commercials.)  The XL set is far superior. Buy that.

1,Anything with Casper Van Dien in it is 3rd rate. While he is an ok actor, he is just not convincing. It's torture watching his films even when he plays a small mediocre role.
1,Disappointing and slow without real delivery on the expectation of scary!  How many of these things will we on Prime have to endure?  Surely there are some good movies out there, but A seems to dredging up the slag the industry pumps out to supply the market with the endless array of boring, insipid bummers!
1,Quest for the Exit would be a better title for this tepid "action-adventure" movie.  Budget-minded to a fault, the actors, script, "special effects" - everything, REALLY BAD!!  An alternate rating system:  5 NAILS! would be more fitting...5 nails for the coffin, 5 nails for a six-foot grave, and 5 nails for entombment in a non-descript part of a dusty film archive warehouse, 5 levels below ground!!
1,A great novel, but the movie could not deliver, Gregory Peck earns a 5*.
1,If you haven't read the book this film is based on, you will probably enjoy the movie on its own; however, if you *have* read the book, and if you enjoyed it anywhere near as much as I did, you'll have some pretty serious issues with the film. I know, I know - not another "oh the book is SO much better" review. But even on its own merits, the film is just ... bad.	Despite the 2-hour length, this movie doesn't go into nearly enough depth with the plot to make it truly interesting; my boyfriend, who has not read the book, said that it was "OK," but that he felt the plot just skimmed along the surface. The dialogue is uninspired, and the acting only luke-warm. The Head Office scenes are almost laughable...as much as I love Chris Cooper, I really didn't care for him in this role at all.	I won't go off on a rant about the atrocious direction...suffice it to say that if you see this film, you'll become intimately familiar with every single pore on every single character's face. The director is *extremely* fond of the SUDDEN CLOSE-UP! Followed by yet another close-up, followed by another...it was painful.	The movie could have been so very much more than it was, and I honestly can't put my finger exactly on why it doesn't work - I feel it's just the sum of all the bad parts. But, if you like spy stories, pick up Ludlum's book - it's truly one of the cornerstones of the genre.
1,I like the mockumentary style but this just wasn't funny. Way too many sex-related jokes and scenes to be remotely family-friendly but the box does say it's PG-13 for "language and sex-related material". Take the warning seriously. This movie is bad just because it's not funny. If you want to see a funny mockumentary, watch Strictly Ballroom. But not this.
1,This film isn't really about Torah codes. It's really about current politics in Israel.
1,"John Wick - you did that to JOHN WICK? DO YOU KNOW WHO JOHN WICK IS?" "Oh my God, you did that to JOHN WICK?" "John Wick...killed three men with a pencil!" When I heard that, fifteen minutes into the film, I couldn't help but burst into laughter. Keanu Reeves has all the sinister brooding quality of...a teddy bear. Now, compare this to The Equalizer and Denzel, a smiling mild-mannered man. Just one look in Denzel's eyes and you know he could do you faster than a buzz saw. This film might have been better if (a) Reeves had bothered to speak more than five words every few hours. He doesn't speak for 1/2 hour! What the heck's wrong here? (b) the puppy sequence is absurd. Okay he gets a puppy and the killers whack it. This sends him on a homicidal rampage? Absurd. The film moves surprisingly slowly yet, for all that, compared to all the other garbage floating around...
1,Molly and Lawless John wouldn't play it skipped over most of the movie. I will never buy from that seller again.
1,The original "McMillan & Wife"--a wonderful TV-movie series along the lines of "The Thin Man" films--included only 36 episodes (not counting the few dull "McMillan" outings after Susan St. James departed). So why did Universal decide to issue this cheaply produced "season one" set?		Blank DVDs and plastic cases cost pennies--there's no valid financial reason for any production company to put out double-sided disks. All the complaints about defective disks have hurt sales. And if sales are slow, Universal will abandon the project, leaving those who did buy with only a fraction of the series in their libraries.		It would have been smarter to issue a well-made box set of the entire series--perhaps including a new interview with St. James--and charge a premium price. I'm willing to pay more to get the entire series in good condition. But I'm not willing to pay $25 or $30 for skipping disks when I know the rest of the series may not be released.
1,A little slow- not near as good as1st
1,I think if it wasn't for the fame that being a "video nasty" brought	it, "Bloody Moon" wouldn't be enjoying anything like the longevity it	currently has. Set in a Spanish language school for girls (how	original), the story sees our heroine Angela in peril as her friend	begin to die around her, and nobody believes her. Suspects are all over	the place, one gory murder follows another until the truth is revealed.	The thin plot is a threadbare mechanism with only enough substance to	it to drive the most basic of story events, and all attempts to	generate mystery and tension fall completely flat. A lot of this is due	to the English language soundtrack which has the most inept dubbing	I've seen for a long time. There's an excess of "sexy" giggling and	gossiping that goes with every scene of the female cast members, unless	they are being stalked or terrorised, in which case it changes to an	excess of screaming and wailing. None of the vocal performances match	what the actresses appear to be saying in the slightest. Trying to work	out whodunnit is hampered by the appalling direction, in which red	herring characters pop up and down every few moments before and after a	murder scene, making you wonder if anything you are seeing is by design	or just random.		Truly awful film-making is here in abundance, in such scenes as the one	where Inga is merrily driven to a saw mill and tied up, gabbling the	entire time, or the one in which Angela sees a shadow on the wall,	walks backwards (??) towards it and stabs the figure hysterically and	then runs off, or the one where a snake dangles into view and is	snipped to death by hedge cutters, or the one where a huge foam rock	bounces out of nowhere to menace Angela, or all the time we spend	watching the girls in their language class and nothing actually	happens, or the one with Inga (again - she's particularly bad) bouncing	on her bed pretending to be having sex, with a dead body in her	wardrobe that it would be impossible for her not to notice, and many,	many more. The only strength the film could possibly claim to have is	the graphic gore, but these scenes are also pretty poorly done. Some	work well for being crudely violent (the sawmill decapitation and the	knife through breast killing), but the death by neck- clamp is	blatantly out of focus, and most of the others are amateurishly	accomplished.		If you only want to see a lot of boobs and blood, plus some of the	worst 80's knitwear ever put on celluloid, then treat yourself.	Otherwise, this is almost laughably terrible. Even the soundtrack,	which underscores the drama with lots of deep "bloop-bloop" noises is	unforgivable. The 2 stars are for the saw mill murder as it has become	almost iconic, and at least the film has enough energy not to be	boring.
1,Ges, non  possibile dare zero quindi mi tocca mettere una stella ma un film cos brutto non l'ho mai visto! e pensare che  pure preso in considerazione per gli oscar nella sezione effetti speciali! spero sia uno scherzo altrimenti si sono bevuti tutti il cervello..............
1,It's ok
1,how many times can this guy say "Giant Stone Balls"?
1,Its about Joshua and the Israelites 7 day march around Jericho.  its entertaining, but it leaves out some facts.  One being Joshua had told the people they were not allowed to talk because their grumbling had caused the time to get to the Promised Land to be sooo long (40 years). In this they actually speak often and complain too at times the Bible says they were quiet.  While it does "entertain", I worry about teaching incorrect stories to our children. God did not put things in the Bible for kicks & giggles.  Everything has a purpose so for them to change this story's details changes the meaning behind it.		Sorry Veggie Tales, but I have to give this one a "Do Not Recommend". You must not change core facts when telling these stories.
1,Just a adult spend whole life with teddy bear and got so attach forget he's out grown itself. It's wasn't for me.
1,Wow, I saw this movie the same night as Max Payne and I was shocked at how much they have in common.  No, not actors or tones or even genres, but that they are both utterly predicatable in less than twenty minutes of viewing.		First, let me say I'm a huge fan of Saw.  Parts three and four had issues in over-plotting and just plain being overstuffed, but they basically worked in their grusome ways.  This one is not so lucky.  It's surprising too because the screenwriters previously wrote four, which was their first foray into Saw, but already seem dried up and out of ideas.  Leigh and Wan penned the previous three and still seemed fresh.  These guys are only on their second!  Basically every twist in this flick can be seen a mile away. *SPOILERS* As soon as you meet the five trapped people and they are told to go against their natures, and they start knocking each other off to get to the next trap, you know that they were supposed to work together.  Which is a nice sentiment to have in a modern horror movie.  Work together, no matter the gender, religion or race.  Whatever.  Detective Stahmer, oh where do I start with you?  Firstly, the actor, don't remember his name, is terrible in this movie.  He wasn't very good in part IV, but he had less screen time.  There are scenes where he actually recites exposition out loud to himself about the unraveling mystery that are absolutely hysterical.  You just want to yell at the screen, "Um hey, I just watched the moving pictures that told us that!  We get it!"  This is still a visual medium, right?  You know, movies?  Even worse than his performance is where he is lead in the climax.  Having seen four previous Saw films you know he's not getting Hoffman, and you know the trap he doesn't get inside of will be the reason he dies and Hoffman lives.  Didn't the main character in the last flick have a similar fate?		Plus, the traps aren't even interesting anymore.  The only one worth mentioning is the second one, The Box Trap, and that's only because the way the main character solves it was slightly unexpected, and kind of cool in it's grusome way.  Sure, there's nasty violence and gore, but so what?  Is it still that impressive, to anyone?  Is there any kind of graphic violence in this film that hasn't been seen before over the last 28 years or longer?  Nope, and the fact that the plot is so uninvolving and the characters so bland it's even harder to give a crap about whether anyone lives or dies.		On the good side Tobin Bell shows up for his requisite flashbacks.  The effects are gross and realistic looking, even though the traps themselves are more cartoony and Rube-Goldberg like(Hmm, maybe they should pick up where Jaws 3-D failed and make the next Saw film a parody.  Admit it, you would've much rather seen Jaws 3, People 0 than to ever watch Jaws 3-D again) but fairly creative in their look.  The thing I miss the most was what the earlier films had.  They made the audience believe they could be caught in these traps, to a degree with a dash of suspension of disbelief, and the films also made you think about what you would do if you were in the situation.  The jaw trap from the first film springs to mind.		Basically, the only thing this movie has to offer the Saw saga(that's pretty funny) is it explains the detective Hoffman plot hole from Saw IV.  You find out why this detective is in on it, and fairly well enough why Jigsaw seems to have so many allies.  The movie is predictable, boring, uninspired, and leaves enough open ends for Saw VI, which will involve a killer Jigsaw wife, or something along those lines, unless the writers woke up and decided to surprise me again.	PS: Fun fact-torture porn is a term of endearment created by a writer who enjoys horror films, and was looking for a funny way to describe the new wave of ultra violent ones emerging amongst the sea of remakes and PG-13 Tiger-Beat fair.  Yeah, the term is now used in a negative light by the morons who still blame movies for the country's woes. The term was originally used to examine and ask why horror had suddenly become more violent.  Could it be the war? Waterboarding? Angry Muslims beheading soldiers on the internet?  Yes, people art, and yes movies, horror movies reflect the current world.  It doesn't point it in a direction it's not already headed in.  We should take the term 'torture porn' back and remove the negativity wrongly attached to it.  Phew, I should write a blog...NATCH.
1,This movie has no plot-no climax. The script is weak. It's so ambiguous viewers are left wondering wtf they just wasted 2hrs of their lives watching. Story line is extremely lacking, I can't believe anybody financed this colossal failure. It should not be ON Amazon & ONLY available in bible thumper stores bc it's just another brainwashing, super Jesus bible thumper movie-don't be fooled by the fabulous cast line up!!
1,No quarrel with the musical properties of this DVD. All four soloists are in a stupendous form of voice. But why is the filming team concentrating so much (to a disgusting exaggeration) on Karajan's hands and movments and by=passing the singers at theirs most glorious moments ?	Is it because of the Karajan cult ?	Take an example of the filming team stupidity:	"Liber scriptus" - the mezzo-soprano solo, instead of the camera concentrating on her, the camera is 'searching' for faces in the female choir, but the female choir is silent at that passage, so why ?	Take the Dies Ira - the camera abandons the solo-quartet and goes to Karajan's hands instead of showing the climax high C - 'property' of Leontyne Price and the other soloists at the peak of that passage.	Too much of Karajan and too little if the singing quartet.	We have had enough of "little-Herbert"; we need the broader picture.
1,bad acting, unbelievable characters, lots of mumbling with script that can not be understood, unreal accents, a plot that goes all over the place.  Over acting, emotional scenes so bad they are seen as fake.  Scenes thrown in the movie that have no relevance, lots of cursing thrown in I guess to save the boring slow movie that only made it worse.  A couple of "sex scenes" that added more sickness to the film.  Eastwood really should not direct movies and Sean Penn was so over the top, and Bacon was his usual self.  Total waste of time watching this trash.
1,Disk 1 defective right out of the box....returned & refunded.
1,:(:(:(:(:(
1,I gave up just ten minutes into the movie. This appears to be one of the most mindbogglingly stupid movies ever made. Don't waste your time. (FWIW, I loved the first "Transformers" movie. The sequel was terrible. This is MUCH worse than the sequel.)
1,This is an excellent production of Pride and Prejudice, and we really enjoyed the DVD version. This Blu-ray edition is a real stinker though, video quality-wise. There's so much buzzing swirling movement in peoples skin and in the sky shots that it's completely distracting, and that's on a 40" HDTV. Yuck. I sure hope the studio takes the time for a do-over. This release looks absolutely awful, I'd recommend you stick with the DVD version and await a new transfer for high-def.
1,Ok OK, why did I watch this? I gave the last 2 previous films 1 star each (wanted to give half a star to both to be honest).		I must say, I was pleased to find out they weren't carrying on with the 'Fairy Secret' storyline, which was a sequel to 'Fashion Fairytale'. This is not the same girl, or is it?! The Fashion Fairytale Barbie said she 'acted' in all the Barbie films...confusing really!		Upon first seeing the cover of this DVD, I was yet again disgusted, "Another 'Plastic' and superficial tale" I thought. I was also angry they were keeping at the stories with these superficial plots and also Barbie's new look and voice judging by the glamourous DVD art. But I gave it a shot anyway.		Upon the first few minutes I was pleasantly surprised, it wasn't as bad as I thought. Yeah, I did not like the tacky 'Princess School' idea. But at least It didn't seem totally fashion related.	Boy oh boy..was I wrong! It wasn't too long into the story that it suddenly got plastic. It happened so fast I couldn't keep up! One second you see the girl in her house, next second you see her whisked off to 'Princess School' on a carriage and you see the area where she lives...graffiti and all, looks like a very run-down area. Then it gets plastic, the annoying fairies are back again too! This time they do sneaky deeds to bad characters and also help out with outfits which instantly disappointed me.		Overall the story WAS Better than the previous 2. I don't know if Mattel were trying, but it was better. But still not good enough. I did like how they told Barbie 'No one can make you inferior but yourself'. Which was good for children, but they did not incorporate it in a nice enough way as there was still so much nastiness and bullying towards Barbie as they told her this and even after they said it. Which didn't make that moral stand out. I think the film had too much bullying and cattiness.		I also did not like how Barbie was so willing to just go to this 'Charm School' when her adopted mother appeared sick and Barbie seemed to be the only income supporting the family. It was really unrealistic and just upsetting. It didn't seem so safe either, considering it looks like they live in an area of crime judging by the look of the area they live in.		I give the film 2 stars as at least it wasn't completely fashion related as the previous 2 and the fairies weren't so prominent in this film. But still not enough heart and morals to give it any higher sadly.		As an adult, I will always remember and treasure the original tales I felt taught children good lessons. It was not about how to do things 'properly' and being 'perfect' like the messages come across in this film, but about standing up yourself, being brave, kind, caring and doing things for friends.		I could tolerate the new look, new voice and just overall 'NEW' Barbie they are marketing if they made her role model material and not 'marketing' material for money. I really miss Kelly Sheridan, she made the stories more 'Magic'. But even adding her voice to the last 3 films won't do anything to these I'm afraid.		I'd personally suggest the original stories up to The Diamond Castle (I don't think Thumbelina, Mermaid Tale or the 3 Musketeers were very good). They taught great morals for girls I think!
1,Herschell Gordon Lewis retains a cult following, but he's an embarrassingly incompetent director. Turn off the sound and "She-Devils On Wheels" (1968) looks like a dreary collection of unedited Florida home movies. Exploitative roadkill without a shred of filmmaking skill  even worse than "Manos: The Hands of Fate."
1,This actress was far more compelling in "Esther Blueburger."  There the audience really had time to get to know both adult and child and have a strong feeling for each.  Here they get lost in the crowd.  Most of all, there is a sadistic and/or passive aggressive streak to most of them that destroys your sympathy.  Finally, I wasn't so much offended by it's flippant attitude towards mental illness as I was bored by it.
1,This title was never released on DVD by the company that owns the rights to it.  'Import all regions' should be a tipoff that it's a ripoff.  Buy the higher quality VHS real thing.
1,The premise of this film pretty much sells itself:  uber-hottie du jour Megan Fox plays a cheerleader possessed by a demon.  But that's about it, at least for me; the story they tack on to it was rather weak.  My main problem is that this film is told primarily in flashback, which pretty much dilutes any sort of tension.  And then they didn't really take advantage of their selling point.  This thing could've easily been ramped up into high camp, much like&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Grindhouse-Presents-Planet-Terror-Extended-and-Unrated-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000UAE7O0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Grindhouse Presents, Planet Terror - Extended and Unrated (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, but it fell far short of that.  Oh well...
1,Horrible. Just don't.
1,This was so much fun to watch! I'm a huge fan of the Flintstones franchise and I loved this cartoon as a child and was extremely excited to see that it was now on DVD. Unfortunately I didn't realize the content was shallow, silly and bad jokes  repeated over and over. In addition, Sally Struthers voice as Pebbles Flintstone is painful to hear. But I enjoy it as a visual while I listen to my favorite tunes.
1,I guess if you just have the prime membership you will get to watch all of the crappy movies for free!
1,Too bad the episodes were cut to shreds. Nice to see the show again, though.
1,Could have been made as a pretty good bona fide film noir, but instead it was done as a "police procedural" complete with silly narration. What a waste.
1,The Invoking 2 doesn't have anything to do with the equally boring The Invoking (2013). That was about a house with some dark family secrets. This one takes the anthology format, does nothing at all with it and adds some dull "paranormal events" and only in about an hour's time. It is the type of rubbish you'd find in a college film class without any art leanings. The acting is non-existent and so is the story-line.  Cheap special effects don't help much either.		"U-Turn" - A man picks up a silent hitchhiker and finds another accident on the road.		"Insane" - A filmmaker with his guide in an abandoned asylum are haunted.		"Alone"  - A druggie woman at home is bothered by the image of her double.		"Do Not Disturb" - A serial killer in a hotel room gets weird cards from a ghost.		"Natal" - A crazy woman at a cabin is driven nuts by the sound of scratching.		 "Melissa" - A girl dials 911 to tell them about  a masked man near her home.		You'd probably have more fun watching the old 1970's horror anthologies like The House That Dripped Blood (1971), Tales from the Crypt (1972), Asylum (1972), From Beyond the Grave (1974), The Vault of Horror (1973), and Trilogy of Terror (1975).		Barely recommended other horror anthology films:		Southbound (2015)		Mxico Brbaro (2014)		V/H/S (2012)		Tales of Halloween (2015)		All Hallows' Eve 2 (2015)		A Christmas Horror Story (2015)
1,The DVD was perfect, I just didn't the movie, that's me.
1,Fangoria Frightfest film number three is Hunger, which many people have compared to Saw. Yeah, this movie is Saw, if Saw had the people locked in an empty room, had no budget, and Jigsaw was a mute cannibal. Hunger is most defiantly a ten on the gross out scale, but besides that it has absolutely nothing going for it. Seldom have I seen a horror film that is as pointless or moves as slowly as Hunger did. The film is only one hundred minutes, but it felt as though I was watching it for days! The star of the film is veteran horror actress, Lori Huering, whose character is pretty well written, but is also unfortunately as dull as the rest of the cast. Most reviews for Hunger have been favorable and I can't understand that. Aside from the victims arguing with each other, there is hardly any dialogue. There is also zero character development, which is crucial in a film like this. If the audience doesn't give two s***s about the victims or what happens to them, then what's the point? Hunger tries to shock you with it's level of gore, but more concerning is the lack of substance and the laziness of the film makers. Yes, the ripped off most of their ideas from Saw. Saw had a tremendous villain and a fascinating story that spawned six squeals, while this film is so lazy that after a month of isolation, the men's beards didn't even grow! Somehow, Hunger got to be part of a major horror festival, but it most defiantly represents the festivals lowest point.
1,We kept waiting for the plot to pick up.  They had not signifficant story line. Very disappointing.  Sorry I bought it instead of renting it..  won't even give it away.
1,All the right ingredients for a good scary movie (scary mansion, stormy night, creepy caretakers, Vincent Price) can't overcome a rotten screenplay and bad acting. Even the cinematography was bad with most of the movie taking place in unlit rooms making it too dark to even see the bad acting.
1,Slow start but turned out okay
1,Lacked depth. Not worth the time.
1,A very tedious experience
1,Sappy, shallow, predictable story. It plays like a cheesy TV drama, complete with swelling dramatic music. Ew. I guess very young women and teenaged girls will like it.  The female lead is very lovely and fun to watch - her acting is over the top but I think that's the cultural norm. The male lead is soft and pudgy and I had trouble seeing him as attractive as her lover or taking him all that seriously. Again, maybe cultural norms are in the way... perhaps a little soft and overweight is sexy in other cultures.
1,An OK movie, but ultimately the subtle message of the books and the internal struggles of Ender are hard to be conveyed in a short motion picture.  Knowing something of the books I was able to fill in the missing information for the most part, but I can see that if I'd known nothing this would have been very confusing. The lessons learned they showed did not have the desired response.		Aside from not hitting the books very well, it was predictable, and not from my knowing the book standpoint, it was Hollywood predictable.  Not to mention within that scope a very weak finish.  Maybe the books and the recentness of them will help drive this for future, but box office losses in the millions do not make investors happy.  This movie had much more advertisement than recent box office Sci Fi flops such as Serenity, and Serenity was a much better movie based on the critics and fans who did see it.		It's too bad, other movies like John Carter, had it preceded Avatar, had a better cast, and been named The Princess of Mars like the books, it might not have lost a ton at the box office.  Now all those other Edgar Rice Burroughs non-Tarzan books will take many more decades before someone decides to film one.  Enders will probably share the same fate.  All you can say now is try again someday.  It took nearly 50 years to make a good movie trilogy out of the Lord of the Rings despite many poor animated attempts, so there is still hope.  Not recommended unless you're just a fan who wants to own the only movie.
1,Pointless, depressing and confusing, this film is NOT worth the extraordinarily long time it takes to watch it.  The dialogue, what of it there was, was bland and pointless, the cinematography was just horrible, the story was impossible to follow what with all the flashbacks and fade in/fade out to what ever vision and dream the director was trying to show.  Seriously, you could make a better movie yourself with a cheap VHS camcorder and make up a script as you go along.  I find it difficult to believe that any production company would have spent two cents - or "kopecks" on this drivel, I am still hating myself for wasting the time I spent watching it.
1,Not worth owning, and probably not even worth viewing if you are used to current DVD quality. Be warned: this is a faux 16:9 video (the black bands are part of the signal) and has some digital artifacts. The net effect is to destroy the experience of what (in the theater) was stunning. Unless you are stuck using an old TV and a low-end DVD player, you should avoid this. On an HDTV-capable system this will disappoint.
1,I bought all 7 seasons but I might now buy 8 because it just wasn't as good as the others.  I have not decided yet and it still isn't out in stores yet.
1,was not very interesting and would not keep you interested in movie.  would not advise to buy or rent movie to watch unless you like dull movies.
1,Just saw this on TV, and have happily now erased it. With a good script, this could have been an interesting film. It's a "very thin cup of tea" of a movie. All too thin. A good scriptwriter could have done something with the idea and given the characters something interesting to do and say. My advice: rent it before you buy it.
1,Some thieves accidentally release a toxin in a school which contaminates the water supply. This turns a bunch of students into blood thirsty ghouls. Unlike Zombies they can move quickly. The movie was designed to be cheesy and campy, but was simply stupid. The funniest scene was when the kids were chased into the auditorium by the ghouls. The doors swung out, but the kids were able to prevent the ghouls from entering by standing/blocking the inside of the door. The budget was too low to rehang a door.		The gore was typically scenes of blood and guts being ripped from a body, although you don't see a face on the body being ripped apart. They used fake body parts but couldn't figure out how to bury/cover a person so just their head shows, making it look like their body is being ripped. The extras were just as bad. The appearances of Joe Franklin and Jackie Martling added nothing to the movie.		F-bomb. No sex. No nudity.
1,I'm 16 now, and I remember most Disney movies with that warm, fuzzy feeling. I was at a friend's house and noticed Pocahontas and thought, I haven't seen that in years! Let's watch it! Then she said, We both remember the first one. I think we have the second one somewhere, let's watch that! So, we popped it in, and stared in dismay as it got worse...and worse...and worse. The history, for one, destroyed it, since I tend to like accurate things. Then, Smith comes in and the other guy(Rolf?) is heartbroken. Mmm hmmm. And Pocahontas saves Smith in the first one, and chooses Rolf in the second, and Smith WALKS AWAY like nothing happened? Take human nature into consideration: he would NOT have been so peaceful. Well, I guess if the kids didn't see/didn't like the first one, they'd like it. I personally hated it with a passion. Don't buy this. Rent it or borrow it. Please.
1,Got to say I started watching this without knowing it was a Scorsese film. It took me about half an hour before I started thinking "Something familiar about all this"  Quick look on the back of the DVD and yep, Scorsese.		Sorry but all this rubbish about him being some great director, it just amazes me that nobody seems to see through his pathetic one dimentional films.  The usual 'wise guys' 'kid growing up in 'da neighbourhood' with the 'local hoods' 'trying to make it good' everybody talking out the side of their mouths in some laughable pathetic attempt to rip off 1930s gangster movies.  Someone made a point of Scorsese being 'anti religion' I would have to ask what does Scorsese have against black people?  In almost every film he produces blacks/latinos pretty much anyone non white seems to be either devoid of any intelligence or topless dancers.  In almost all his films they are refered to using the 'n' word (even in this one in the first few lines of the film when there is not even a black person in sight!) The driver in Goodfellas after pulling off the biggest highjack in US history then gets drunk and falls asleap in the getaway car (as you do like!) I mean was he dropped by a black person as a baby or something?		The film is just awful.  Can Scorsese not think of anything else or has he given up hope after his pathetic attempt at looking at theology with last temptation?		So whats the film about?  Usual gangster drivel.  This time instead of Italian 'wise guys' it's the Irish.  Instead of going back in time and having poor Daniel Day Lewis speak with some stupid accent where he cant make out if he is an Al Capone gangster or a fishmonger from Sunderland or Vegas with Casino.  Blah blah baseball bat scene, Jewish bookmaker pointless anti semitism, blah blah blah......  This time we move to Boston (exactly the same set up though) Think I lost count of the amount of times in the first 20 odd minutes of the film they made a point of refering to themselves as Irish with the usual Irish stereotypes.  Irish jokes, the IRA, the Irish 'hood' 'Irish are all drunks' 'Irish are all mad' even the 'Irish president' for Gods sake.  Yeh so what you come from Boston so your great great grandfathers sisters aunties best friends cat once had some connection with Ireland so what?  Some would think that afer the 3 or 4 odd generations they would not be still speaking with Irish accents and if they did they could have at lest got Irish actors instead of American making a pathetic attempt at being Irish.		Cop who grew up in the 'Irish hood' goes undercover to investigate local Irish gangster.  Cant realy say much more about the story line because their isn't one.  Just a complete waste of such a great actor as Jack Nicholson.		Give it up Scorsese, Goodfellas was a great film but thats about it.  Sooner or later more people will see through your paper thin plots.
1,I saw this film when it was first issued. I found it dreadful, yet boring--which this play is not. The stupidest feature about the film is that it is performed in Italian.  Or if you search, you can  probably find it in Greek,  There was never a production of it in English,  This bordered on the absurd since I remember that the film had premiered in  Greece, where it was performed in Greek and then in Rome where it was performed in Italian.  There was a big discussion among the producers over which version should be shown in London and New York for English speaking audiences.  Italian won  out, since the Star, a former opera singer, had always sung the opera in  Italian.  The production is rendered more senseless since the film was originally intended for England and New York and the Medea was an American who naturally spoke English.	Now Amazon offers two filmed DVD's of the play., one in Italian and the  other in Danish. Neither will be well received by students or  people who have no patience for reading subtitles.	What use are these productions to a High  school or college students studying theater or ancient History?  Or to adults wanting to  introduce the play to their youngsters?  Won't somebody offer a Medea in English and with  subtitles so that this masterpiece will stay in the public memory!!!	The Zoe Caldwell version produced for Broadway was absolutely astonishing in its power and intensity.  I have always reveled in the discussions on the play  with my Ancient History Classes when I show it. The students go wild. It's in  with Zoe Caldwell, but  the  video tape is old and worn  out now.  The amazon cost is prohibitive and the college doesn't have any money and neither do I.  Come on Hollywood, help me out, now. The Maria Callas version in Italian just won't do, plus as a theater production it is dreadful  I Expect  that the Danish version is just as much a waste of time..
1,If you like Japanese trivial movies, this is a good one for you. Brought back memories of technology shortcomings of the '50's and '60's.		Still better than most of what Hollywood has to offer.
1,i actually watched the entire thing.	i don't think there's any excuse for a movie to be this bad. i do not see how this got made. i'm, literally, pissed off that it did. i'm offended by how stupid this movie is & i harbor personal resentment toward the folks as made it.	that is all.
1,The movie eschews logic and wit in favor of being a big-time action movie with no moral center and no emotional drive.		Which is a shame, b/c any good movie follows SOME kind of logic, and Green Lantern's world has benefited in the past by wit (a Superman episode using 2nd-tier Lantern Kyle Rainer comes to mind) and has most certainly suffered in the past without it (the John Stewart Green Lantern of the Justice League cartoon).		In brief, the film jumps right into the action, turning pilot Hal Jordon into superhero Green Lantern within the first 10 or 15 minutes. While that might sound fun, you end up with no emotional connect with the character. Imagine if Iron Man was missing the first 25 minutes or the first two Spider-Man movies were missing the first 30 -- that's what we have here.		While we see a host of characters fans have clamored for, and the voice work and casting is truly EXCELLENT (including an interestingly cast John Larroquette [Night Court, Boston Legal]), it does nothing to help this brainless actioner be anything but 2nd-rate ideas live-action action directors Roland Emerich or Michael Bay would have tossed aside.		Try Justice League: Savage Time -- far more depth, far more interesting, and far, far more clever.
1,Interesting premise but took too long to get to the climactic point and when it got there, it was a letdown. Seemed as if something significant was left out of the story line.  The film jumped from a very long beginning, to a very short puzzling ending with no middle.
1,I watch something like "The Secret of the Magic Gourd" and wonder what possessed someone to bring it over to the states.  There are plenty of great foreign movies that exist.  Most of what we get are made for adults but I have no doubt good family and children films exist outside of the states.  I can't start listing names of which of these films I consider worth bringing over and what aren't because I haven't seen too many of them, but my first impression of "The Secret of the Magic Gourd" is that it deserved to be left on the other side of the pond.  This is a harmless but headache inducing film.  It's one of those films where a young boy has dreams of doing something great and one day gets to do that...with a little bit of help of course.		The story involves said boy who fishes out a magic gourd one day (voiced in English by "High School Musical" supporting character Corbin Bleu) who has the ability to grant wishes.  Likewise the boy wishes for a lot of crazy stuff until some of it makes his life more complicated then it needs to be.  And...there's not a whole lot more to say because this is about as complicated as it gets.  This movie was made by Disney in conjunction with Centro, a Chinese film company.  The history behind the film itself is more interesting then anything in this film.  See, Disney has had a long, troubled history with China.  When Disney released Martin Scorsese's film "Kundun" they upset the Chinese government a great deal.		The Chinese government, who only lets 20 foreign films into their country each year, made it particularly difficult to crack the market.  This is one of the reasons Disney made "Mulan," to help get on the countries good side again.  Then someone at Disney had the idea if they co-produced a film with a Chinese film company they wouldn't need to fight to get that film on the Chinese market (not a bad idea really).  Thus we now have "The Secret of the Magic Gourd," which is the first in what I expect to be many co-productions between Disney and China.  Obviously the film is not great, but compared to some other Chinese films I've seen this one certainly is very advanced as far as film making is concerned (though by American standards it looks like something you'd see on Cartoon Network).		Sadly, though I didn't like the film much I must insist that in the future Disney take better care of the location.  An English dub is fine but the original language track needs to be provided as well (preferably with subtitles).  This is a Chinese production through and through, so it's perplexing that Disney is trying to pass it off as an American film (the cover itself doesn't clue you into the films origins very much).  I know this is for kids and adults likely won't care, but it seems just a tad disrespectful to still be doing this after the "Princess Mononoke" fiasco.  At least the bonus music video is in it's original language.  Do I recommend this film?  No.  For a better family Chinese import I'd recommend Stephen Chow's "CJ7."  Still, if Disney plans to get serious about their new partnership with China it could lead to some interesting family films in the future.		Rating: * Star
1,I am a huge fan of any reality shows about criminals or crime, I was so disappointed with this show, I feel like the producers just wanted to make a full season any way they can.		Most of the episodes are a pure joke, these so called gangs are nothing more than a bunch of teen high school drop outs waving gang signs and driving around in $200 dollar cars but the producers somehow thought they should dedicate a full episode to those losers.		Most of the characters are a joke, I couldn't stop from laughing when I was watching some of these clowns lecturing there ideals infront of the camera, truly the highest moment in there lives.		I'd say maybe 2 or 3 episodes are watchable , the American gangster and the Arian brotherhood thats about it, the rest are just pure garbage, I recommend MSNBC Lock Up.
1,Worse than the first, 'Agenda'. Although the failed Congressman uses a more diverse and more experienced set of presenters and interviewers, the message is more strongly Christian and exclusive this time around. I'm a right-winger but I'm not a Jesus-freak or Christian. That kind of narrative totally killed my enjoyment in the show, and killed his credibility. He obviously wants to win another award from a Christian org.		Btw, collectivism is not a bad thing in itself. It is not the same as communism. Nuance please!  There is a reason the Scandinavian nations enjoy a higher standard of living and longer life expectancy than America,,,duh.
1,SO SO
1,More fiction that science.
1,one of those movies that is slow, weird, and never goes anywhere and then just ends abrubtly
1,not the best show, slow, predictable and rather boring..... Really thought it would be much better - rather disappointing but I kept watching till the end.
1,Deep Shock should have truthfully been entitled Deep Schlock.  What an odd movie.  I'm not certain when I've last heard eel jaws "snap" underwater, but this movie gives you that.		David Keith (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/An-Officer-and-a-Gentleman/dp/B0035LSXDW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">An Officer and a Gentleman</a>,<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Rose/dp/B0000634AR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Rose</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Brubaker-HD/dp/B00K0EDRU6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Brubaker [HD</a>]), usually a pretty decent actor, does his best to keep this "C" movie afloat.  Calling it a B Movie would be an affront to B Movies everywhere.  Playing Captain Andrew 'Andy' Raines, USN, and having have been in the Navy for 20 years, I can attest to the WRONGNESS of his uniform, Keith is teamed with his on-screen ex-wife, Dr. Anne Fletcher (Simmone Mackinnon&nbsp;), and Chomsky (Mark Sheppard (Badger from&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Firefly-episode-Shindig-HD/dp/B004XUMOUW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Firefly episode Shindig [HD</a>])) to find out what is happening at the bottom of the northern polar sea.		Well, filmgoers, what's happening is that eels, yes, that's right, EELS are planning the eventual and inevitable take-over of Planet Earth.  Chomsky wants to put an end to the eels, Fletcher wants to learn from them and Raines wants Fletcher back and Chomsky to quit hassling the poor critters.		It's a pathetic movie and you'll soon forget you'd even spent 90-some odd minutes of your life watching it.
1,What is it with destroying the Enterprise in the TNG franchise?  They seem to treat her like a damn Yugo: cheap and easily replaceable.  Borrowing liberally from its own past, this film demonstrates how tired the franchise has become.  Not that we're tired of the characters, but they obviously need new direction.  There is no spirit of discovery left.  Berman and company have bled the turnip dry.  At least with the TOS films there seemed to be a desire to move the characters forward, despite the obvious and necessary commercial ambitions of the movies.  Berman seems content with just holding a record for spin-offs.  They tried to make this their Star Trek II with a black hat villain and heroic sacrifice in the end, but there's no emotional connection.  It's all too fantastic to believe.
1,i wanted halloween 2 the remake and they send me halloween 1 the remake i have that one already and they won't let me send it back was very upseat with them.
1,boring movie that's been done before and this time, not so good.
1,The stories are long and quite boring. Nothing truly interesting that I think make these couples stand out from the rest. Sure some have obstacles, but doesn't every individual and couple?
1,Keeping up with the tradition of pathetic Superman movies, Man of Steel does not disappoint. Im guessing the idea was to reboot the classic comic book hero for a younger, more descerning audience. The result ends up being a story-limp, CGI-heavy feature that simply falls flat on its face while pretty much ignoring decades of media cannon. I hate the Superman charactor but even I can see how far off the hinges this one went... For instance, here are three GLARRING problems with this movie from a comic-book lovers standpoint: 1) Does anyone in the movie NOT know Clark is Superman? I mean really? And lets say you lived in this world - how brain-dead stupid do you have to be not to realize Zod takes you right to his childhood home? One of the greatest story points at the beginning was Lois not knowing who Superman was, but that too went right out the window on this one. 2) Why did no one seem to care that thousands, upon thousands of bystanders were dying in those fight scenes? Not only that, but where were the bodies? If you're going to go through the effort to create the violence, at least have the balls to show its consequences. 3) And not lastly - How does a super-advanced race just die out when thier home world explodes, yet a group of convicts, in a broken ship, have everything they need to simply go terraform a planet?		I cannot believe a sequal was approved for this disaster...
1,Was not HD quality. Service buffered from time to time. Lot of pixelation was noticible. Film looked older than it was.
1,This movie was very Bad. This is one of the worst movies that I ever seen. Don't see this movie very bad.
1,Twists and turns were silly
1,Subtitled melodrama.
1,Could not get into this movie at all, even though it stars one of our all-time favorites, Maggie Smith.  Watched only about 30 min. and never finished it.
1,This movie is bad, folks.  It's rare that I regret spending $3.99 to watch a movie on Amazon but I wish I could ask for my money back for this one.  It's just bad.  I love Jonah Hill and thought this would be a modern spin on "Adventures in Babysitting" or even "Uncle Buck", but it's actually boring most of the time. I think the only really interesting thing about it is that Jonah helps one of the kids he's babysitting figure out and come to terms with the fact that he's gay -- that was a surprise the movie went there, and the way it was handled was well-done and beneficial to the kid.  But the rest of the movie feels like it was written over a weekend and the movie was made for $2 million dollars and filmed over the following weekend. I didn't find any of it funny, and I actually felt bad for Jonah Hill because he's usually in much better movies.		Avoid this one unless it's ever on here for free with Prime membership.
1,... for those who ask little more than sound, motion, and color of a film. The jarringly anachronistic soundtrack will heighten their experience. Viewers possessed of more refined sensibilities beware.
1,We can create a short list of the attributes of this movie. Let's see: dumb and incoherent script, dumb characters, dumb scientists that would seem to have been chosen for a hugely expensive space exploration by their level of incompetence and stupidity, a deranged android. One can easily imagine to be watching one of those awful and cheesy 1950s science fiction movies, if it not were for the beautiful and shamelessly wasted special effects of this one.
1,Watched about 8 minutes then turned it off. I recommend you watch 8 minutes less than I did.
1,Okay, I just saw this movie last night.  I was kind of looking forward to it.  I like Wahlberg and the film looked visually cool.  I've never played the game, never really heard of it, but due to the title I figured it was either a video game or a comic I've never heard of.  Putting on a movie based on a game is never something I'm overly-excited about, plus with the addition of the director John Moore(directed terrible remake of The Omen, Behind Enemy Lines, and the not so bad remake of Flight of the Pheonix) I started feeling less and less excited about this movie's prospects.		Well, lets just say the movie isn't terrible and it's a long way from great or even good.  The trailers that I saw led me to believe this had strong supernatural or horror elements to it, one of the reasons I was intrigued to watch it.*SPOILERS*  Well, it doesn't at all.  Despite its stylized look, color scheme, or the fact that angel like creatures appear every once in a while.  They aren't really there you see, they are hullicinations of the psychotic soldiers and various others that take a blue liquid drug(they drink it of course, no needles allowed in a PG-13 movie).  I was okay with this.  It was the only unexpected twist this clunker offered.  Part of me was sad that there was no supernatural elements but another was happy to have a kink in the mundane plot.		This is your basic police detective looking for revenge story. *SPOILERS*  I'm sorry to say but the whole movie is really easy to figure out about fifteen minutes in.  The only part I didn't get yet was the flying creatures, but in about 20 more minutes that becomes obvious and then there's nothing really interesting done with the concept beyond the dopey climax, where our hero is all doped up and maniacal has he shoots everyone.  This is basic connect the dots screenwriting and it's so ham-fisted that the only type of people who could possibly be entertained would be those who have never seen a film before...EVER.  And that's actually not necessarily a fact.  Once we meet Donal Logue's character you know he's dead, once you know that Wahlberg's dead wife worked for a drug company and everyone is downing viles of a blue drug, you know they were in on her death, as soon as Beau Bridges shows up as a friendly face and head of security for the drug company you know he's the main bad-guy, and so on...		There's one scene which I love the most.  It's towrads the middle when our dynamic duo of Mila Kunis and Wahlberg find out that all the victims in the story are linked by an angel-wing tattoo.  They track down the spot where one victim got the tattoo and the tattoo artist not only knows the meaning of the wings, he even has books about the subject, right next to him on the counter.  It's like he read the screenplay and knew which materials he needed to have.  Lame.  Plus, can anyone tell me why the Mila Kunis character was in this thing?  She wasn't interesting and the help she provides Wahlberg could've been acheived a million different ways on his own.		The acting is capable.  There's no bad performances, but there's no characters to play either.  Eveyone is just competent.  The visuals are the only memorable thing about this film.  I liked the snowy atmosphere and muted look of the film.  John Moore is a really good visualist.  He'd make a good director of photography, special effects technician or concept artist.  Unfortunately, he's the director and he is not very good at that.  He's like Michael Bay that way.  Though, Bay is getting better wtih his last two flicks having stronger material.  Maybe Moore will get better too, but four films in and we only have one decent remake...
1,Boring.  I'm a big fan of action films and loved IP man..for instance. Huge fan of the avenger movies, etc etc. This movie has some cool effects and ONE good actor. Mr. Always Sunny in Philly. He's great. The rest of the movie was just boring. It didn't suck, but not worth $5. Really, it's a $1 week long rental.
1,I really wanted this movie. I saw part of it on HBO or Starz. So I ordered it from Amazon. The transfer dub from the factory was garbled. There was a flaw in the whole movie. The images would not stay still. Just the video transfer was flawed. Amazon sent me a replacement. The same happened again. I asked for them to call the manufacture to do a make good on my purchase. To find me a decent dub of the movie.		Yes, Amazon refunded my money. But do you think the customer service department would even listen to me. I wanted to buy this movie. So why can't a manager from Amazon, call the distributor of the movie. Tell them the problem and I try to get me this movie.		I rate the movie as good. Amazon's customer service as very poor. Even trying to hear me out to make good my purchase. Yes, the refund is fine. But they could have tried harder to call the manufacture and make good my purchase.
1,I found this to be one of the most bombastic pieces of propaganda I've seen on the Afghanistan War. Frankly, it makes me leery of all of Mike Boettcher's past reports. This is not reportage, but patriotic jingoism. American and allied troops were under heavy pressure during the time of this filming.. There was (and is) widespread concern for the lack of achievable war aims both at tactical and strategic levels. Boettcher reduces all this to a Viet Nam like struggle for the hearts and minds of the Afghani's- grossly oversimplifying a dangerous and frustrating situation. Allied efforts at infrastructure creation and nation building have been undermined by the complexity of ethnic and tribal divisions, corruption fuelled by a wilfully blind eye regarding opium and hashish production on the part of "friendly" govt. officials, warlords and tribal leaders, and finally the complete failure to implement public education outside the sphere of radical Islamic fundamentalism.  Although the election of Mohammad Ashraf Ghani as President of Afghanistan is an enormously hopeful sign, the thousands of NATO troops remaining in the country are still mired in the failures of the early years of the war: alliances made to local leaders without regard to their legitimacy or integrity, the lack of viable alternatives to an opium based economy, and a lack of strategy regarding an educational systems that is almost entirely in the hands of anti-Western clerics. Compound all this with the destabilising efforts of our supposed friend Pakistan and it becomes amply evident that the blood shed by Americans, our Nato allies and as many as 200,000 Afghan civilians has bought very little security, freedom or even hope. This film's rah rah, can- do-ism is either naive or false. To be honest, I suspect Boettcher of the latter. Our soldiers have paid far too much on blood and sweat for so little in return.
1,Actors are old enough to know better
1,This product was a series of "out-takes." I was led to understand, by the product description, that this was a series of episodes. No worries, though.
1,I had high hopes for this flick, but I was let down again! This movie in a word: sucks. With a little editing, it could easily be ready for broadcast on The Disney Channel in prime time! Story is weak and the extensive use of CG effects renders this "Green Lantern" pretty much dead on arrival. Not even hunky Ryan Reynolds can save this beast. My recommendation? Save your money and rent or buy Ryan Reynold's earlier release "BURIED", directed by Rodrigo Corts. "BURIED" is way better than this turkey...IMHO.
1,I bought all 3 seasons of Gilligans Island and turn it on almost every evening. My son loves it . I thought this DVD would be a great add on to the other ones but boy was I wrong. They seemed to forget how to act, only the Skipper and Mrs H seemed to remember how to act. I thought the storyline was so stupid and boring, I was only about a half hour in and turned it off as I didn't want to ruin the way they once were. Picture quality was terrible, white specks through the picture and picture was not clear the old shows were sharper picture and nicer color. What ashame,  goes to show you no remake is as good as the original
1,Nothing great, just so-so.
1,Don't bother
1,For all of the promotional hype, I felt that this movie did not stand up to all of the critical acclaims.
1,Poor film with very predictable story line. Expected more out of the director with such a reputation. The two stars are for Kareena's performance.
1,This is such a lame excuse for a Sci-Fi movie and it's not even entertaining. The plot is basically just Predator set in Viking times with a stupid semi-love story thrown in. What a waste! You'll notice a bunch of 2nd-rate actors that you've seen in other movies and they are all unable to breathe even the slightest bit of life into this movie. I should have done something else with the 2 hrs I wasted on this junk!
1,The series is beautifully produced and well-acted. But the grisly focus is creepy and offensive. It's just porn in a pretty package.
1,Strange movie. Was expecting a biographical movie which it really isn't. Plummer's acting is great and wasted on the poor screenplay/story.
1,This is in my mind can be loosely considered a remake. If you watched the original Lone Ranger episodes with Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels, then trust me. Avoid this at all costs and save your money. I would not even give it a star, but it is unavoidable.  As my title says A Complete Disaster
1,One would think with Jackie Chan big picture on the front would mean he's the star, but after the first 5 minutes, well lets just say he turns into a magician and pulls a disappearing act. The movie feels like it was made by some Chinese high schoolers and Jackie's appearance was more of a moral support. Dumb plot, dumb acting, and dumb filming..
1,I saw this movie in the theatre when I was 12.  I'm now 30.  I still remember it as the worst movie I ever saw.  Ever.  (Raising Cain is #2 and Van Helsing is #3.)
1,I thought that The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring was incredibly boring and highly overrated.  It seemed to drag on, and finally at the end, when the excitement comes, you learn that in order to find out what happens...you have to watch 6 more hours of the movie.  The least Peter Jackson could've done would've been to give it a little more of an ending.  Otherwise, it's like an open-ended waste of time.  I recommend not wasting your time on this one.
1,Not scary at all. Very disappointed.
1,I'm hoping this review is for the amazon streaming video. I bought the actual DVD and then saw it on instant video and couldn't wait for my DVD to arrive. The movie was good... The quality of the streaming was TERRIBLE! So grainy and ugly that it was almost turned off. Can't believe I paid to see that horrible quality.
1,Has a glitch now it won't play
1,???Plot spoilers??? The reason why I question this is because there is a severe lack of plot.		Tania (Kanisha Buss) suspects all men and hates to see anyone happy. She is hanging out with Vicki (Gloria Huwiler) planting ideals in her head that her man Alex (Darric Terry) may be cheating, that she needs to pop into his office unannounced.		As it turns out Tania is correct. Alex is a sex addict, but not a bad guy as he realizes his fault and has asked God for help.		At this point the couple never talk to each other and resolve things in their own camp of friends with the help of God...eventually. That is the film. Grandma (Efe) was an over the top character, afraid of germs. The movie is shot on 4 sets, the office and living room, with minor bedroom and bar scenes. It feels like a play.		There is an Ed Wood moment with Alex's tie. Vicki picks out a blue and white stripe tie for him to wear. That day at the office when Maxi (Yazmin Watkins) shows up he has on a blue and red stripe tie. Later, when Grandma shows up and comments on his tie, it is blue with white dots. That night in the bar, the tie is black.		Perhaps the most ridiculous thing is that Alex keeps a massive black photo album with the word "CONQUESTS" on the front. Who does this besides Gene Simmons? Clearly this is playing to a woman's worst fears.		This is a faith based film that didn't hook me. No swear words, sex, or nudity. A little cleavage.
1,CHEAP THRILLS certainly lives up to its title, but I thought it failed to really offer anything besides increasingly grim stakes and a nihilistic worldview. Make no mistake, with the the exception of Sara Paxton (who really doesn't do too much talking anyway), the movie is well-acted. David Koechner is the standout, and he does a sort-of twisted version of his comic persona here. The movie is also well-made on a technical level, and is actually quite restrained in terms of gore. Granted, the movie isn't trying to be anything profound, but I've seen so much "torture porn" by this point, that I suppose I've become numb to it. This movie just didn't hit me in the way I thought it might. The best part of the movie is learning that all the events that transpired were part of a sick bet between a husband and wife. Everything else was just too familiar, and a little underwhelming. Overall, I thought it was a slight waste of my time, although fans of indie horror might get more enjoyment out of it than I did. My advice is to get your kicks elsewhere.
1,It's too bad so many people  are not really understanding how bad this movie really is. The comic book community, who are the vast majority supporting this film, need to have individual opinions and not love something because their "circle" of friends do. Anyone above a 12 year old mentality should recognize early that this film suffers from horrible dialog, misfire jokes, music that is totally out of place, bad acting and a plot that's same old same old. You can tell the producers wanted this to be exactly like the Avengers in style and tone but unfortunately they totally drop the ball. The problem is the actors. Whoever made the the decision for this casting should be fired and go back to working in the real world. Peter is a pretentious, loser sad-sack  character who is suppose to be the hero. The guy trys so hard to be Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark whipping off dialog that's suppose to be clever and funny but not. His character in the real world would be reading his very own comics in his moms basement. The Raccoon is about the most unlovable character in the movie. Telling Drax, "Who cares if your wife and daughter are dead" and walks away never apologizing. Speaking of Drax, he has to be the worst actor in the movie. I mean damn, it's actually cringing to listen and watch this guy try and act. Michael Rooker is so miscast. His character is basically Merle from Walking Dead. Every other word is boy or son in that white trash demeaning way. And what's up with the songs and music? I was born in 1970 and I even hated the songs. It seem so out of place when they kept sticking it in and pounding us over the head with it. Again it's very pretentious and out of place. We even get a extremely lame post credit scene. Howard The Duck?!? Really? I know it was suppose to be a joke, but Howard The Duck? This is what the producers pulled from the Marvel Files. A cameo by a character that flopped in is own movie and no one really gives a crap about. Except now, all these comic book geeks will think it was cool and probably make him a icon in the next few years. Save your time and money on this and stick to The Avenger films!!
1,Main character not scary, same old stuff, waste of time and money
1,Terrible story line - ruined the book - cut out the entire story - plot and everything that made it interesting.  Now it's just light porn and might as well have taken place by the pool with the plumber.  What a waste of time.  Read the book. That was worth it. This was a crying shame!  Left feeling less than horny.
1,Lots of new faces again. Loved 1,  really liked #2, 3 sucked.  So wanted to like this movie.  Thank God i only use up a free rental on my cable to watch it.  Save you money.  Pass on this.
1,This movie had almost none of the same characters.  Even Duke hardly has any screen time!  It seems like they threw together the same old action movie cast and slapped "GI Joe" on it for guaranteed ticket sales.  I should mention, though, Bruce Willis is great and deserves better than this.  Also, Byung-hun Lee was good in RED 2.
1,premise unbelievable, plot discombulated.  Bruce Willis must have owed the producers a favor.  Should have done my due diligence before ordering
1,IT was not worth a crap because all they did was sit and talk. No action  or  involvement or solutions.
1,Unless you're between the ages of 12 and 18, this is a terrible movie.  If you're an intelligent person between the ages of 12 and 18 and agree with me, that means you have a brain, and are not high.  This movie is gaspingly awful, and ranks among the top 100 worst movies ever.  It's poorly acted, directed, scripted and plotted.  If the first 30 minutes don't kill you with bad acting and teen angst, you should be decorated for bravery.  Avoid this movie at all costs.  I just wasted $4.99.
1,Very very lame
1,I saw it at a house party, having heard how wonderful a picture it was supposed to be.  The scenery was beautiful, and the mass movement of buffalo was impressive.  But for all the acclaim the movie has gotten, these were the only merits the movie had.		The story is very slow-moving, and the characters are all stereotypes.  The Sioux are the "good" Indians, the Pawnee, enemies of the Sioux, are the "evil" Indians, and the US military (except for the protagonist Lt. Dunbar) are such total buffoons they make the Keystone Kops look like models of professionalism.  The story itself is full of improbabilities too.  A white woman kidnapped by the Pawnee as a child (and later retrieved by the Sioux) is suddenly able to speak English to Lt. Dunbar, and when Dunbar returns to his fellow soldiers, they shoot his horse and after dozens of shots, kill Dunbar's pet wolf, who stayed around and let the bullets fly at him.  (Like even incompetent soldiers would waste valuable ammunition killing animals for no reason.  Sheesh.)		It should be noted that none other than MAD Magazine wrote a parody cartoon of this movie, in which it compared "Dances With Wolves" with other current movies-the major comparison being that none of them were an honest depiction of the American Indian.  I agree.
1,Characters not lovable. Show is silly.
1,Lacks the character development of the 1995 version with Amanda Root. The ending was like a bad romantic comedy with Anne running around like an infatuated teenager. I had so looked forward to this production and was sorely disappointed.
1,Awful.  Hundreds of brilliant possibilities with a forty-year world-renowned property and they come up with a played out, unfunny modern "comedy" with Eddie Murphy of all people.  It deserved better.  An animated version would have been better than this.
1,Despite taking place at the first gay weddings in Spain, don't expect any insight about marriage and homosexuality from this film.  The couples could have been straight and the movie would have been the same.  Also, despite featuring three Spanish actresses made famous by their work with Pedro Almodovar (Veronica Forque, Carmen Maura and Marisa Paredes), don't expect them to play anything that remotely resembles the gender-bending, sophisticated yet entertaining characters they portrayed for Almodovar. In this movie, their talents are uniformly wasted under the guidance of a far less talented director. "Queens" is just a frothy, mindless, and intermitently amusing comedy that centers of the mothers of three gay male couples that are about to get married.  The women have plenty of star appeal, and they make the whole thing watchable, but one wishes that the director had fully taken advantage of their talents.  My best advice is to get the DVDs of Almodovar's Matador, Kika, What Have I Done To Deserve This, Women on the Verge, The Flower of My Secret or All About My Mother to see these actresses at their best.  As for the gay men in the movie, they're indistinct from any other six gay men in your average US gay movie.  The movie hints at troubles between them (related to physical beauty, infidelity, social class, and nationality) but it simply glosses over them.  Still, if you're looking for close to two hours of gay-themed visual bubble-gum, "Queens" will be good enough for you... just leave your brain out the door.
1,embarassing flop for Johnson.  More plot holes than a ton of swiss cheeze
1,Perhaps the title should be Demons and Da Vinci ....I don't believe I have witnessed an online video/movie which is so skewed with bad guys. From the beginning to the end, the storyline of Da Vinci's Demon's perpetually develops and sustains more villain's than anything else I've viewed. Just when you think the Bad Guys have reached critical mass, another Bad Guy pops up and is far more surely than the previously introduced. Not another cheap, poorly produced film comes a close to Da Vinci's Demons, rank curt with such a thick competition of demons, villians and outright bad guys and chicks...Good luck to anyone who chooses to sustain any vision of a better world, and people who have the moral compass.
1,The only "Ultimate" with this item is the hype. The HD is perhaps 720i at best and the scenes are boring even for screensavers, which is all that you have when you buy this. Man, did I ever waste $14!  I gave it 2 stars just for the cloudy sky time lapse sequence; that one was actually pleasant.		If you want exciting, crisp HD of natural wonders, buy the Planet Earth series or any of the Sunrise Earth offerings in blu ray. Discovery HD does it right - not this amateurish melange of detritus.
1,The story is slow and boring, too much talk, not enough action.		Good for a nap. Don't waste your time.		I suggest you spend 2 hours of your life watching some other movie.
1,of the hundreds of war movies I've watched this is a lower than a B movie movie at best. CGI's were ok not planes looked fake, as they were ,but too obvious. Action scenes poor graphics real or generated....Dont waste time ...
1,Man kills dog. Man who owned deceased dog kills man who killed dog. The end.
1,I didn't see the first Messengers movie and I wish I had skipped this one. The only thing that seemed appealing about it was Norman Reedus but the film was too disappointing for him to make an impact.		This movie is NOT scary whatsoever in fact its attempts to be frightening are comedic. The film is boring, slow and has absolutely no point. The writing seemed nonexistent and it's like the movie is being made up as it's filmed. The characters weren't well-developed at all and things that were put out there to enhance the plot never came to a head.		For example, John and his wife have obvious friction from the beginning of the movie but we never really know why. We can only guess it's because John can't properly support his family but then again we get the idea that John resents his wife for her capabilities in comparison to his. Why I can't comprehend because she didn't do anything but stay in the kitchen. So I can't see why he felt threatened by her. It's not like she was some career woman. Whatever the reason, it wasn't executed. We just see two wooden characters with a huge lack of chemistry going back and forth for no reason.		I saw no point of the daughter in the film and she looked older than the parents. The little boy was thrown in to do a cliche "The Sixth Sense" type role. That's another plot hole. Supposedly the son can see and hear things others can't but it's NOT followed up or executed. We never know why the son has these powers. Is it just so someone could warn John? We also never understand why it's important for him to have these powers when he only "saw" something once or twice. It made no sense.		The wife was useless. I would've much rather the film be with John as a single dad with his son because the daughter and wife were not needed.		John's hopping around the cornfield for 90 minutes was relentless and torturous. I kept waiting for something scary to happen but ended up dozing off every five minutes. I had to keep rewinding scenes because the film was so slow I couldn't stay awake! If a horror is putting you to sleep then something is wrong.		The only interesting character was the old guy with the young wife. The wife was just an excuse to have a lame sex scene. And let's not forget the ridiculous scene when the dead girl pops outta the cornfield. Yawn!		This film is a big fail. They had a lot of interesting things to work with but fell incredibly short. The plot was horrid but if the story and acting had been decent I could've overlooked it. Unfortunately everything sucked.		Stay away from this dribble.
1,To slow... not enough scary scenes... it's about bugs.
1,This review is about the DVD set -- NOT the series. I love, love, LOVE Due South the TV series.		I bought this DVD set as a "backup" set to the 5 separate DVD sets I already had from the original releases of Due South on DVD, just in case anything ever happened to it. (Seasons 1-4 plus the two-part Call of the Wild series finale.)		I really wanted to like this complete set. I looked forward to having all seasons and Call of the Wild in one complete set in two DVD cases, instead of my previous complete set spread across 5 DVD cases, each purchased individually.		Unfortunately, as is often the case with DVDs, especially DVDs of TV series -- you get what you pay for (and I paid $10.99 with free Prime Shipping).		This DVD set is from Echo Bridge Home Entertainment. And it is of very poor video quality. Yes, I know there are limits to what can be done with original 4:3 aspect ratio broadcast TV shows in this day of HDTV, UHD, and Blu-Ray, etc. -- but there is a right way to put a 4:3 aspect ratio TV show on DVD, and there is a wrong way. Echo Bridge chose the wrong way.		The de-interlacing was done improperly. The picture quality is poor because the video compression is high -- that's what happens when you compress the video so you can fit 6 to 9 episodes on each DVD. There is pixellation of the image in some spots, and multiple discs I had skipped. I was able to rewind back over the skipped areas, and see the skipped footage. But this speaks volumes about the quality of the video and the discs themselves.		Due to the poor video quality, the DVDs actually look better on my old DVD player than on my Blu-Ray player.		That's because Blu-Ray players tend to "upscale" the video image of non-Blu-Ray discs. Unfortunately, upscaling a poorly compressed, shoddy video conversion only enhances the flaws -- it doesn't improve the picture quality, it makes it *worse*.		This DVD set actually looks like a slightly better-than-amateur bootleg in terms of visual quality -- as if they used Handbrake or something to rip the video from the original DVDs, then reconverted and compressed to fit more episodes per DVD with some other open-source conversion/compression/DVD burner software. Actually, I'd bet money that that's what they did -- and that's why they can sell it so cheaply and still make a profit.		The disc menus don't allow you to choose to view one episode at a time. You can only choose 2-3 episodes at a time (and you must move between them with your chapter-advance button >| ). That's fine for pivotal two-part episodes (such as the 3rd and 2nd to last episodes of Season 1, Victoria's Secret Part 1 and 2). But it's lousy if you want to skip around to different episodes, because then you have to use the chapter-skip button to go past episodes you don't want to watch if the episode you want to view is 2nd or 3rd in a block of 3-4 episodes.		There are no subtitles on this set. The originally released DVD sets had subtitles in English (and French, of course -- it's a Canadian-produced show shot primarily in Toronto, with only location shots in Chicago). This set doesn't even have the subtitle info. So you can't use your TV's CC (closed captioning) to get the closed captions/subtitles, either.		All in all, this is a hack job. The original set was much better. But since those are no longer available, I guess this is better than nothing. Makes me cherish my original set that much more, though. Glad this is my "backup" set and not my "real" set. Also very glad I didn't pay much for this set. It's not worth the original list price of $29.99, I can tell you that much. $10.99 is about all it's worth.		That being said -- if you can watch this on an older DVD player (not a Blu-Ray), the adventures of Constable Fraser and his two Chicago cop friends Ray and Ray are pretty entertaining. For the most part, it's one of those lovably quirky (Canadian) shows from before that was a thing. It is appropriate for family viewing.		But despite being appropriate family fare -- one might say deceptively appropriate family fare -- for sharper adults, there's plenty of unresolved sexual chemistry, deeper themes and hints, and the usual cop buddy tropes done with some unusual flourishes Canadian style. Some fans didn't like the changes made by Paul Gross, who plays Constable Benton Fraser and became executive producer in Season 3 (and 4)... but some fans liked the changes quite a bit. Your mileage may vary.
1,I had to send this movie back because it won't play. That broke my heart because I love Audie Murphy movies.
1,One word for this movie - ugh.  The biggest problem with this film, and there are many problems with this film, is that it seems to be edited by someone using all the finesse of Freddie Kruger slashing up a screaming teenager.  Scene changes are frequently abrupt, and flip to unrelated, often confusing, acts.  The film's prologue is too long, and often snooze-worthy.  I can suspend my disbelief long enough to allow for a gi-normous snake to rampage around a city, looking for someone.  I can't suspend my disbelief long enough to allow for virtually no one interrupting their day-to-day lives while a huge snake tears up their city.  In the world of Dragon Wars, apparently no one ever heard of the concept of "evacuation".  Hang out; dodge pieces of building torn loose by the big snake; grab a cappuccino; and go on with your day.  The hero was tiresome; the military and FBI were portrayed as incompetent; and the whole situation was tiresome.  I found myself rooting for the big, bad, snake to take them all out, and end the misery that is this film.  The best part was the end of the film.  One reason: the film was over!  Another reason being the final scene was actually well done, with a great CG fight scene between two CG snaky-dragons.  The actors actually provided some good acting in the final sequence, although the hero's presence was a big band-aid for one of the multitudinous plot holes.		Don't waste money on this dragon dud.
1,I gave this movie two viewing attempts and couldn't sit the whole way through it.  Someone asks me to describe this movie and I would say a whole lot of fight and chase scenes against a blizzard like backdrop of forgettable CGI scenery and eye candy amidst characters and a story I didn't care about for a second.  Another glitzy remake with a screenplay written by a marketing matrix that would get a D from a community college freshman writing class.  Other than one or two thought provoking dialogue snippets that didn't last long this movie is Eminently forgettable.
1,As movies go it's pleasant enough; Brendan Frasier plus a hot woman is watchable, but let's face it Brendan is no James Mason. The movie is an excuse for a 3D film (they used the RealD polarized system (passive glasses) in theaters which was dark but good), and would be all right IF the 3D was even remotely as watchable here, (It's not). To combat pirating they used a magenta-green system instead of the red-blue standard, and it's even worse than bad. Now that there are Mitsubishi and Samsung HDTVs that are 3D ready out there the studios need to get with the program and produce either field sequential or polarized versions,(watchable on affordable 22" iz3D monitors). Anaglyph just doesn't cut the mustard anymore. People who will pay for blu-ray will shell out for the hardware to get a decent 3D experience at home! If I were either of those 2 companies above I'd contract the studios to put out software for the Tri-def or Stereoscopic viewer format which they are compatible with. Without a decent format to view the 3D on, this picture didn't need to be made........stick with James Mason.
1,Hey Cuba! William H. Macy wants his Best Supporting Actor Oscar back for Fargo that you ripped of of him for your "performance" in Jerry Maguire!!
1,I am not a fan of the "killer family lurking in the woods" type movies. They all seem the same to me.	From the synopsis written and the creepy poster, you expect a supernatural presence to be somewhere in this movie. You also expect there to be more of a creep factor to be involved. Instead, I got a movie where I don't feel invested in any of the characters and there is nothing supernatural about this movie.	In fact, I never really caught on to if they were a family, or a bunch of guys who are just crazy. Either way, this movie just didn't do it for me. I'm glad I waited for it to be free on Prime.
1,I liked the whole "life lesson" component but the constant screaming was unnerving. I just don't think it was my cup of tea.  I imagine that during it original airing that it was quiet provocative in terms of exploring the pitfalls of the hippy lifestyle.
1,Alright
1,Some very funny moments and a different perspective of the Old West.  However, Seth MacFarlanes excessive use of the f-bomb becomes tiresome and offensive real quick.  Also quite a bit of toilet humor, it's almost as if much of the movie was produced by 14 year old boys.
1,I was quite disappointed with this film.  The director used some non-actors to play some of the parts, and it shows.  Also, the editing and camera work is shoddy.  In one particular scene, you see Mouchette turning her body, which causes a coffee cup to move toward the edge of the table.  In the next shot, the cup falls to the floor.  The effect is very self-conscious and clumsy.  Finally, the actress playing the girl fails to convince us of her state of mind that occurs at the fim's end.  Perhaps other viewers may like it.
1,The usual zombie movie.  This on takes place on a small Pacific island.  One of the humans never seems to 'get it' that you have to shoot them in the head.  He shoots 30 or 40 of them and they just keep coming.  His friends never tell him.  Once in a while, he gets one in the head and it dies.  But he doesn't catch on.  ho hum . . .
1,This movie sucked! I wish I had read all the information about it first. Made in Japan, language in Japanese. Bad acting! The movie was a little gory but in a fake way. Save your money and buy a HAMBURGER and FRIES.
1,Old technology poor quality
1,I love Abbott and Costello.  I always have.  Well, sure they were retired, if not dead, when I started seeing their films as a kid, but I loved them nonetheless.  I tell you this because if you are contemplating this DVD you must be a lover of Abbott & Costello.  I caution you now, this is no documentary, and a very sad attempt at a highlights reel.  It simply amounts to being trailors for several of their films.  I enjoyed it because I saw many of them on Saturday morning television with my grandfather, and only a small fraction of them seem to be available on DVD.  But, if you are not a big fan, this DVD may be a big disappointment.
1,what the hell this is in pan and scan universal is the worse this is the year 2015 and everybody has a hd tv i don't beleive the universal idiots are still selling this this film is a widesceen movie funny but the opening credits are widesceen then its goes to 1.33.
1,I am a big fan of parodies and dark humor, so I was really hoping that this would be good. Well, the first time around, I hated it. The non-stop babbling squeak-fest that is Excel's dialogue got on my nerves and was at times, almost intolerable. On top of that, laughs were scarce (except for a few moments about keeping a dog alive as a back-up food supply and a villian named "That Man"!). Sometime After seeing it all the way through, I discovered the existence of ADV Vid Notes on the DVDs and presto! Everything suddenly made sense and the funniness exemplified.		The thing with Excel Saga is that almost all of the humor/parodies in it, can only be picked up with an either an innate understanding of Japanese history/culture, or with these Vid Notes turned on. Trying to laugh without either of these is like driving in the dark with no lights. I cannot stress the importance of this feature enough. The Vid Notes are fascinating, educational and do a good job of clearing up everything so that no joke or parody does un-noticed. But here's the kicker: THE PRECIOUS VID NOTES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THIS BOX SET! You need to buy the individual DVDs or Excel Saga - The Imperfect Collection to get this feature. Thats why I'm giving this 2 stars less than that of Imperfect collection- its that important.		This show mostly focuses on the plotless misadventures of the annoying, blabbermouth Excel and Hyatt, the much quieter girl who basically just dies over and over. But there are side stories concerning a man named Pedro who is trying to win his wife's love back, and Excel's apartment neighbors who become civil servants. There are several crappy episodes, though. I find it very hard to enjoy the two Menchi Adventure episodes, all clips that have anything to do with the civil servants (the Power Ranger costumes they wear are the only thing remotely funny about them) and the two recap episodes. This series is plotless, yet there are recap episodes... sure, one of the characters makes a joke about the stupidity of doing this but that don't change the fact that those episodes suck.		Basically, this is really only worth getting if you can find DVDs with the Vid Notes and you have an incredible tolerance for floods of rapid-fire squeaky dialogue and bad filler.
1,Had a lot of good people but they didn't gel together--not fun at all really stupid
1,I found the pilot show boring. I just was not impressed with the acting, the story line, any of it. Didn't need to see more. Yawn...
1,I didn't like this movie at all. The first half of the movie dwells on sex too much - typical of Hollywood. It's definitely not a family movie. The happy ending is that she learns to live with an unfaithful spouse.
1,never liked this one, not really sure what they were going for with this one because it had nothing to do with the first class, nor was it tied to the later timelined movie series.  This movie is like the terminator series where they try to convince you they can prevent disaster before it even begins, and by the end of the movie, you're supposed to accept the new reality they created out of thin air.  I'm actually glad they made apocalypse, so i can skip this movie and pretend it doesn't exist.  The apocalypse did a great job of not not only tying the know with the later movies series timeline, but explained more properly how things ended up at the end of the prequels
1,didn;t mean to purchas this.  Not interested in it at all.  would like to get a refunds .
1,Honestly, this show is a joke.  Tries too hard by throwing into the plot every imaginable "scary" element just to come out looking insipid and boring.  Nothing here that makes me continue to watch.  Made it through two episodes and that was enough for me.
1,I saw this movie only a couple of days ago, and already I hardly remember it. It's just not very good. The production values are quite fine, and so are some of the performances. But the main character is somewhat aggravating, and the plot goes nowhere. I was glad to see it end.		It's hard to see what point this movie is trying to make. In a way, I guess it's attempting to update and incorporate some elements of the 1956 movie "Tea and Sympathy," where a straight man is mistaken for gay. But now, nearly half a century later, it's time to move on, isn't it?
1,The movie was okay, didn't care too much, sort of boring, but the end was the most stupid end. Terrible waste of my time!
1,Poverty Row's answer to Charlie Chan's entire output is assembled on this cheap DVD.  The picture's themselves are a mixed bag, but given their brevity they're never actually boring.  (The second in the series is easily the best and is a serviceable whodunit.  Like the Chan series Mr. Wong is less interesting when the stories are set in the underworld.)  What's best about the series is Karloff's performance which forgoes racial caricature.  He speaks in his regular voice and it's cultured, unbroken English. I'd like to think his famed courtly manner wouldn't allow for anything else. (Or maybe this is an apology for his earlier Fu Manchu.)		The bargain basement cast and sets are re-used from picture to picture.  Some of the actors are so unstudied that in some scenes they project something approaching naturalism.  Similarly, there are fights that are so under-rehearsed that they come across as unusually realistic and violent for the period.		The really curious entry is the last in the series which stars Keye Luke.  Here we have the novelty of an Asian actor playing an Asian detective -- there's even a hint of romance with an Asian actress!  (And there's a biting and subversive little throw-away line he delivers about raiding the tombs of Chinese antiquity.)  Of course, elsewhere this entry also includes the worst stereotypes of the series.  But there are some location scenes that take the series away from their dreary backlot.
1,For starters, I love The Honeymooners. I grew up on the "Classic 39" and was delighted to discover the lost episodes later on. The "Color" Honeymooners was an interesting curio in the history of The Honeymooners series but it's a total waste of time if you already have seen the lost episodes. A large majority of these new color episodes are little more than remakes of old honeymooners sketches from the early 1950's which were far better timed and acted. The songs in these new episodes are largely forgetable time wasters that merely justify an hour long time slot. Just skip this set and hunt the old B&W treasures.
1,Not plausible
1,No subtitle or caption for hearing loss and deaf!  Million of hearing loss and deaf in America!  That company already made captions from Season one to five  but  not six and seven.  They don't care about hearing loss and deaf.  I tried to talk to them and the president of company refused and he is SO GREEDY man!
1,Why did Kevin Sorbo agree to star in this movie? It was a terrible, low-budget, ripoff of "Predator." Mr. Sorbo at least tried to give a good performance, but the action and pace was herky-jerky, and the dialogue was simply awful. Watching it was a total waste of time. At least it was free on Amazon Prime.
1,I was an Ernie Reyes Jr fan back when I was little, from watching Sidekicks (TV series), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2, and Surf Ninjas. Well I knew this was written/produced/action directed by Ernie, 'The Process' as it was originally called was hyped up by the fans to be a good movie. I, along with other fans were expecting a good showcase of martial arts, being the players included both Ernie's and the West Coast Demo Team. Boy was I totally wrong. I go rent this movie for $4.00 and got basically get 90 minutes of fluff. Bad acting. I mean, BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD. Incomprehensible plot, incomprehensible all-around. Everything about this movie was bad. I'm not joking. I'm sorry that they spent $50,000 on the production of the movie, according to Ernie Jr's website. What a horrible waste of money. I say Ernie should hook up with Yuen Woo Ping and do some Hong Kong Cinema. Showcase his skills the way it was meant to. Seriously. All in all, please save your money and do not, I repeat, DO NOT rent or buy this movie!
1,I'll complete my full review later.  First problem is that the Digital copy expired on 3/5/2015 but it is still listed as having a Digital copy available.  If that is important to you, don't buy this.
1,What a garbage movie. I know the public doesn't have great taste, but man, we are truly witnessing the fall of modern society if people think this is a good flick in any way.
1,Couldn't get past the first 5 minutes. Just not what I expected. I guess I'm the wrong age.
1,I honestly cant recall watching another movie as straight up boring as this one was. And i thought about it for quite awhile before making that statement just to be sure I wasn't going to say something that was an exaggeration. Normally i would've shut this movie off after watching about 30-40 minutes of uninteresting, unentertaining nothingness. But because of the 7.1 IMDb rating and the 80% fresh rating on rotten tomatoes, i stuck with the whole movie thinking the entire time that because of those high marks, that this movie has just got to get better eventually. BUT NOPE! It remained thoroughly uninteresting, unentertaining and VERY BORING throughout. The only reason i gave this 2 stars and not 1 star is because of the dialoge and how it was recited. The words they spoke and the way the actors delivered those lines were very realistic. Like the way real people in real life speak and communicate with each other. For me, that was the only good thing about this waste of 2 hours of my life film. To me, this was an utter pointless waste of celluloid. And im not an action movie junkie or anything like that. I don't mind a slow-paced movie as long as it has a good story and a point to it with a satisfying ending. This movie had none of that. Only painfully sloooow and booooring.
1,Don't like it.
1,Awful, awful film. The snowboarding shots are pretty good, but no plot and terrible acting...don't waste your time.
1,After watching the DVD on Guilford, CT. I found this lacking so much of CT. history.  Too caught up in the Fairs.  Truly left out much of the shoreline
1,This movie I had high expectations for. It was a big disappointment. The scenery of romantic Italy was the best part of the movie. The actors were okay. How can you can this movie romantic? In the opening scene the husband is having sex with a much younger co-worker while his wife is visiting her doctor for her chemo treatment. Then late in the movie the groom is kissing his best friend before his wedding. It was very hard to like most of the characters. What a waste of time! It could have been a lovely romantic movie. I've watch thousands of movies and this was very disappointing. I am glad that I watched it before offering it to my friends. I will get rid of it as soon as possible. Pierce Bronson was much better in "Mama Mia" which was a far better movie than this one. Save your time and money and pass on this title!
1,This is one of the WORST transfers of a film to DVD I have ever seen. And I have a massive collection of DVDs, so I know from whence I write.		My DVR recording of the same title from cable TV looks better than the DVD, so it looks like I will be transferring that version to DVD and saving it in my expensive new DVD case . . . with artwork, of course.		Hey, I suppose I should be grateful that, at least, it's widescreen.
1,This movie oddly had all of the previews and lead up indicating it to be part of the After Dark collection, but it's not marketed that way. I didn't realize it was a SyFy movie, but that makes sense now that I know. It was pretty much on par with what they tend to put together. Teenage girl picks a red clover while hunting with her grandfather. Apparently this makes her a target for the (least leprechaun looking) leprechaun that the townsfolk had previously sucked all the luck out of. Meh at best.
1,The cannibalism scenes in the 'Troll' movies are more believable.
1,I watched the first one and it didn't seem to be that biblical. So I haven't watched the second part yet. Hopefully it gets better than the first
1,Wasn't worth watching lousy plot.
1,This movie breaks my heart.	It's well shot and well cast, and the actors do a good job.  It's based on the stories and novellas of Larry Brown, who is one of my favorite writers.  I've also always liked Arliss Howard, ever since I saw him in "Full Metal Jacket," and he gets behind the camera for this one, and stars; somehow he manages to make himself look a great deal like (what I imagine) a Brown hero would look like.  And the music on the soundtrack is fantastic.	But the movie totally misses the mark.  It probably looked good on paper -- a Southern "Barfly" with broad, surreal touches -- but on screen it just doesn't work.	The key element to Larry Brown's writing has always been simplicity.  He sketches scenes with precise characterizations, short concise images and lines of dialogue that read like a breeze.  "Big Bad Love" (the movie) trades all that in for flashy nonsense and makes the whole thing seem phony.  The stories whisper short sentences but the movie shouts through a bullhorn and repeats lines over and over.	The film is largely based on the short novel "92 Days," which is about a beer-thirsty, frustrated author who cranks out stories and gets into a whole lot of trouble without really trying to.  But where the book had, say, a moving scene with two brothers, the movie has a scene with twins... identical twins... who also dress exactly alike in nerdy shirts.  Everything in the movie is underlined, everything is QUIRKY.  By the time three characters picnic on a football field while an oblivious marching band stomps past, you'll feel you're watching one of those early 70s flicks made by straight people trying to recapture the spirit of "Easy Rider" with liberal amounts of inexplicable wackiness.	This movie is to Brown's work what "Where the Buffalo Roam" is to the writings of Hunter Thompson -- they got the right ingredients, they just didn't put in the right amounts.  I suspect the filmmakers' hearts are in the right place but they misjudged the source material and amplified all the wrong things.	Admission: there's one scene where a man scrapes Alpo out of a can onto a cinderblock for his dog.  The scene is a throwaway, taken from a fairly static section of the book "Joe," but it seemed to me to be the only true moment in the film.  If only the rest were anywhere near as good as that.	Read the books.  Skip the movie.
1,bad acting/bad plot
1,This is a disaster.... For some reason, Edvard looked like he had spent at least 10 years in the Gulags since the last movie.  The new Paige was obnoxious and pretentious.  Stay away from this one!
1,Worst Horror Movie	Boring, boring and boring.
1,I really love Elmo and Sesame street. But this movie is unsafe for a 2 year old. My baby loves Elmo. There is a scene with an objectified woman who dances curvy silhouette dance while Elmo looks at her mesmerised. Inappropriate. Do not recommend.
1,I love the book series, so I'm probably already biased against the film...		I think Russell Crowe was a terrible casting job for the main character.  Not only is Jack described repeatedly as Very Blond (Goldilocks is his nickname) and Russell far Too Dark headed, but he's also Regularly described as Noticeably Overweight...  I would love to have seen John Goodman (or similar) play Jack, as he's also meant to be a powerful and larger-than-life man...  Crowe plays him not only too subdued, but also a bit too 'clever' in a day to day sense...  Jack is meant to be a bit of a bumbler socially, and has a love of puns a bit beyond that of a wry man, but he is a genius seaman and naval tactician...  the two are Meant to play off of each other...  a jolly man, something of a bull in a china shop, but a firm and fast decision maker in his trade...  like a man who has learned his craft from boyhood, but somehow missed the social upbringing to be witty and clever among the city society folk...		Stephen Maturin, the series' other main character, is also sadly miscast...  'the doctor' as he is called, is regularly referenced as being a man that looks indeterminately Old and wizened...  he is foreign in nature to the English crew and is distinctly withdrawn into his science and naturalizing to the point of being impractical and distinctly absent minded...  he is described as unattractive and even nearly ugly in the sense that he does not care for his appearance, gets far too much sun, and wears old threadbare clothes all the time...  Again, Hollywood decided to replace him with someone distinctly too young and 'pretty'...  they even fail to have him wear his somewhat ridiculous worn out powdered wig all of the time...  and his rapport with Jack is distinctly lacking in the film...  he regularly makes naval faux pas and puts his foot in his mouth in the novels, and none of that is successfully presented.  By failing to represent his dottiness and clumsy social skills, he just comes off as a snobbish jerk, to my mind.		Add to that the overall youth of the crew, admittedly historically younger, but simply cast far too 'pretty' for the lifestyle as it is presented in the most excellent novels.  Endless sun, salt, surf, poor diet, rum, and hard labor at ropes all night long would make for a crew more along the lines of your usual 'pirate' standard...  not necessarily crippled, but distinctly 'weathered'...		Inaccurate as that was, I found the overall Acting and countenance of the crew not only silly, but a bit Insulting in the film...  The books make it quite clear that the life is hard, and storms and battles are rough, but the men of that time were very much Hardened to it and would Not cringe and cry in fear as they are portrayed in the film...  the Surprise (Not the first ship of the books) was, in fact, manned with a Seasoned crew of Experienced man-of-war's men...  they did Not get Seasick, or get weepy during a storm...  they knew the hardships of the sea, and were stoical and strong...  Any member of the captains crew so quick to give up, claim total destruction, and failure in all endeavors would have been kicked to the curb, or never made to rise as far as they are seen to be...  to watch the actors winge and whimper is just silly...  (somebody slap that man!)		Which, to make things all the worse, brings us to the complete shambles that is the story itself.  Among a series of 21 most excellent novels, there are countless battles, and the first book itself is full of events worthy of a film, but it seems that the writers put the first half dozen novels in a blender and poured out a chopped up mess of quips and quotes with complete disregard to the Reality that the books are so well known for, and do so well.  Oh, let's put in the cheap jokes, but disregard the plot line, history, and every single story as presented...	Even the title is a mishmash of more than one book title!		As a final failure, the film is full of pathetic attempts at the proper accents and slang terms of the seamen.  A language known the world over which itself has spawned linguistic subsections all over the globe, the complete lack of ability to capture that very distinct reality just made even the dialogue impossible to abide.		This film seems to have come and gone without much ado...  and I think we can safely say they will not be picking it up again anytime soon...  this is sad because the books are among the best writing of its sort ever made, but with the complete failure of this adaptation, I am sad to say I would rather see it wither and die.
1,Absolutely one of the worst action hero movies I have seen. Unless you are bored out of this world and want to wile away time with ANY movie, anything but this piece of shame would do.
1,so stupid
1,I intended to show this to friends with dinner. Took a quick look at the beginning and changed my mind. Grant's dialogue is so juvenile, not at all funny, just stupid. Hard to believe a movie that got such good ratings back when it came out has such a stupid beginning. Don't buy this movie; you will be disappointed. I doubt it gets much better; dialogue is just too clever and silly. Real disappointment but keep in mind there are a lot of people who like this movie big time. I just couldn't watch Grant's acting and dialogue in the beginning.
1,not quite as I remember it.
1,love this series!!!
1,We turned it off. Was a slow moving film.
1,I know this is an older type movie, and of war torn Italy,but it has such poor story content. And the way the mother treats the teenaged daughter like a two year old is very hard to swallow. The area it was filmed was very accurate, and the little bit of historcal content was fairly accurate. I'm just happy that I didn't have to pay a high price when I purchased it.
1,This was the last time I watched TV, I canceled my cable shortly after this last season.  It proved to me how bad Hollywood in general has gotten, they have no substance anymore, no character, no talent, nothing.		All TV is anymore is reality TV, and shows such as this that leave the audience wondering what happened over the last few years while watching this?
1,this movie literally had the identical plot as PA3. and i don't mean the same theme (as all the PA movies will obvi have the same general theme), i mean the exact same plot. they're clearly no longer trying to put out a quality product; only cashing in the success of the first movie.
1,Decent special effects and acting can't save the dopey tediousness of this made-for-TV sci-fi actioner that's ultimately done in by a clumsy plot and the worst title ever given a film, ever, ever.		Despite the obvious comparison to the big-budget "Independence Day" of more than a decade prior, the only similarity between that blockbuster and this DTV nonsense is the alien-invasion story and the ridiculously convenient and inane deus ex machina plot devices that let our heroes save the day.		Otherwise, this one is about aliens who decide to terraform the earth, using giant, robotic phalluses that burst out of the ground, and flying, spherical drones that protect a mother ship that emerges  suddenly!  from behind the moon.		That's all we get.		A ragtag group of nerds, teenagers and the president of the United States (!), team up to save the world. And it's a good thing they do, because this is one of those movies in which the only people who exist in the world are those with speaking parts. It's like the filmmakers spend so much money on special effects, they can't afford to pay an extra or two to stand in the background to at least make the town that's getting destroyed by alien robot drones look somewhat populated.		Tom Everett Scott from "That Thing You Do," the only player of note in this drivel, has matured into a handsome and confident actor who needs to fire his agent, and hire one who can talk him out of idiotic films like this one, "Santa Paws 2" and "Mars Needs Moms." Seriously, dude's got some chops. There's gotta be a "Law & Order" or "CSI" franchise for this guy somewhere.		Most of the other actors in this movie, surprisingly, give it all they've got. I mean, once their agent sent them a script that said "Independence Daysaster" on the cover, they should have been expected to phone it in. But these little nobodies act their little nobody hearts out, and it's so charming.		Not charming enough, however, to make this a good movie, or one worth recommending you spend 90 minutes of your life with. Despite everyone's good intentions, "Independence Daysaster" is a disaster.
1,I have seen the original many times, and any time it's aired, I'll watch it.  This remake was disappointing.  I'll never watch it again.  If I could have reviewed it without giving it any stars, I would have.
1,Even though the couple is attractive their Charactors were terrible. Story line and script are dull. Could have been cute but it was Raunchy and stupid.
1,Was really bad not worth watching. The acting was really bad. I wanted only to see Eric Estrada. His acting was really bad
1,Predictability ends up being a virtue rather than a sin with "Slumber Party Massacre 3," the 1990 film that was the third installment of the original trilogy (if repeating the same story counts as a trilogy).  A young girl has a slumber party with her girlfriends at her parent's beach house.  Their boyfriends show up to try and scare them, but out in the darkness lurks a homicidal maniac with a power drill who takes advantage of the situation.	This film was the one and only directorial effort of Sally Mattison, and the script was written by Catherine Cyran, which made me sit up a bit when the opening credits rolled by because I was curious as to how a sex & slasher flick that was directed and written by women was going to be different from the normal voyeuristic approach employed by their male counterparts.  Now that I have seen the movie I find it hard to believe that I have gained any insights into what young women do when they play "truth or dare" by themselves.  Then again, women have never been the target audience for these movies.  This is just another instance when I tried to have a semi-deep thought about this film and was brought back to some semblance of reality when such thoughts spiraled out of control.	Once again the soft core elements in "Slumber Party" outweigh the blood and gore of the "Massacre," but neither justifies getting this far into the series.  Watching the first one twice would be better because the second time around you could read a book or pick up stuff around the room.  It was a toss up as to whether this film was better or worse than the previous installment, "Slumber Part Massacre 2," and I ended up going with this one because it had more violations of my personal rules of things to do when a mass murderer is in your house and because I was rather offended by the revelation of the killer's motivation.  You do not watch these sorts of movies for social relevance.  Dismissing this film as a rehash of the first two is rather a moot point because if your title has "Slumber Party" and "Massacre" in it there is little reason to expect creativity in terms of the plot.  The killings are your one chance at being artistic, so to speak, and there is nothing special here in that regard.  The first killing is the best of the bunch and then the film deteriorates.	Final Note: If there were scenes where (a) the killer went out and nailed shut every door leading out of this house and (b) the teenagers tried every door and found it nailed shut, then I must have missed them, which is strange because I do not normally fall asleep during movies.  The victims in this film are definitely Top 10 nominees for stupidest teenagers in a splatter flick.  There is only so many times you can yell "OPEN...THE...DOOR!" at the screen before your voice gives out.

1,Juvenile, more for teen audience.
1,I think people should stick with the Norma from L'Orange with Caballe if they want a DVD of Norma. Caballe was a true Norma. Cedolins tries hard, but I think she fails vocally. She looks and acts the part reasonably well, but this is not bel canto singing. The production is interesting, but the only singer that sounds like she is up to her role is Sonia Ganassi as Adalgisa.
1,I know Disney had a dark time between their golden year stretches, but wow is this movie horrible. Probably a reason I went this long without seeing it until my own kids brought it home.  I honestly don't even review Disney or Pixar movies because almost every time it would just be the same 5 star awesomeness over and over :-)  Perhaps its unfair to then compare to its siblings as the bar is normally set too high.  If I had been told this was put out by another production company like DW or Nick I might have gone in with lower expectations and thus found it humorous.
1,I just watched Dragonwyck -- it was on You Tube -- and I'm not sure why it's part of this Fox Horror Classics compilation.  It's not a horror movie.  It's what would be called a Gothic movie or Gothic romance movie (although I don't think there was much of a romance here).  Dragonwyck can be considered a good movie but it's just not really to my liking.  Too much God talk.  Maybe it was true to the time and characters, I don't know.  But I didn't care for it.  And the big reveal about Vincent Price's character towards the end just wasn't that big a deal to me.  Some people will watch Dragonwyck and think it a four or five star movie.  But it just wasn't for me.  I'm going with two stars.
1,Found footage films should be illegal under pain of death! If you like these films then you know nothing about film and are of subhuman intelligence.  It probably costs under $5,000 to make one of these craptastrophes depending on how much the camera and airfare costs. Probably less if you get drunk art kids from the local brewhouse to act in it for top ramen. HIRE A REAL CAMERAMAN DAMN IT!!! I hate these movies almost as much as I hate first person shooter video games, contemporary modern "art" or watching TV on iphones.
1,It's not that it didn't stand the test of time, it's just for me Leslie Howard is about as exciting as watching mold grow (for the record I didn't like him in Gone With The Wind either. It's not that Bette Davis was that good, it's just Howard was so bad he made her look good.		I know I live in a different age, when teeth are so white they are blue but I couldn't get over how bad Leslie Howards teeth were. I was so zoned in I kept straying to the thought, my gosh his breath must be killer and they must be hurting him and thats whey he keeps his mouth closed.		Plus after a while you just wanted to slap Leslie Howards character for being so stupid.
1,my daughter was a big fan of this series but she was disappointed; maybe our memory made us think it was better than it really was.
1,I hope that they shot it digitally, as it would have been a waste of film and chemicals. Perhaps I needed to be drinking.
1,Three reasons to not see the movie are 1)Jake Gyllenhall,		2)Sella Ward, and 3) Randy Quaid. Im not sure I spelled their names correctly- but do I care? Absolutely NOT.  All 3 actors are horrible. Theyve got as much depth as actors, as President Bush actually doing a good job running our country. As for the movie itself? The story is as bad as the actors. The only positive thing I can say about the movie are the special effects.  They're great! Very realistic. So if theres any reason to watch this movie, watch it for the special effects. But if your expecting good actors and a good story, you'll surely be disappointed.
1,That this film is highly popular reveals the depths to which our culture has declined.  How bad can a movie be.  Well, the kids like all the action, apparently; explosions occur with regularity here.  The script is utterly brainless, the casting is ridiculous, and the overall product is shoddy in the extreme.  Maybe Weinstein is to blame; somebody was.
1,Boring. Predictable.
1,"Thumbs Down!"	SCARY MOVIE II has to be the worst sequel this summer!  It was weak, with little humor which couldn't surpass the original.  Though, I didn't even think the original was so great.  With spoofs on The Exorcist, Cast Away, Charlie's Angels and so on, Scary Movie II just won't be as appealing to audiences this time around.  Just because Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans and Anna Faris return, and Keenen Ivory Wayans returns as director, doesn't mean that the sequel is always promising.  Stupid, Stupid, Stupid is all I have to say for this movie.
1,not worth the rental fee
1,It was okay. Fairly predictable.
1,Not recommended
1,Duvall and his wonderful co-star Angie Cepeda deserve much better than this creaky, contrived, and often embarrassingly preposterous vehicle. The screenplay, by the pro Bill Witliff, is pretty awful. His old-fashioned story is littered with cliches, his instant romance between Duval's crusty old cowboy and the world-weary Cepeda is patently ridiculous, and though they both do their best with their poorly-written characters, they can't save the movie from itself.
1,I bought this because my husband thought it was a different version.  We love the story, but this version is terrible.  It was made for television a long time ago. Lots of old-fashioned singing instead of dialog. Parts of the stories were also left out.  Do not waste your money. It is truly awful.
1,If you like special effects there is something in this film for you. The casting choices are strange, the performances somewhat stiff. Some of the lines they say made me wince. I was embarassed for them
1,Boo. Boo. Throw the rotten tomatoes.
1,I normally only buy movies that I've seen before and know I will enjoy watching again. I think I bought this while I was under the influence of cold medicine and sleep deprivation. I hate General Patton but I really really hate MacArthur. I have no idea why I bought this movie.  I would upset if I rented it so you can imagine how I feel about buying it. I am sure some events and conversations were created by the directors. The real MacArthur was a pompous ignorant bugger who was a failure as a leader of men. The movie tried to make him out to be the 'good guy'. Why does every war movie have to have a romantic love story? Why include a woman at all in a movie about post war Japan? Ask a million women their favorite romance movie is and I bet not one says Emperor. Don't get me wrong....I like women. I think they are pretty awesome sometimes. I just don't understand why they feel the need to have a stupid romantic element in every movie. The movie would still sucked without women but not by much. Spoiler Alert: The United States are the victors.
1,Pretty Lame
1,Pink Flamingos was the first film of John Waters which went over all the underground circuits. But his career has nothing to do with Jonas Mekas, Ron Rice, Lionel Rogosin or Jim Jarmush. Water is absolutely unworried about the form; but engaged with unhealthy tendencies of the human being.		The aberrant competence is established between Divine and the Marbles. The main guests (in this beloved cult movie among whom I don' t belong) are perversion, coprology, torture, blood, overweight and visual aggressions that conform an obscure journey through an awesome exhibitionism.		As accurately Danny Peary states, that weird fascination by blood, meanness and pain around the camera would seem to delight itself may be suspicious of fascism.		If you have an iron stomach, watch it. If you don `t,  abstain yourself.
1,It's only a fair movie.
1,This is one of those movies where it's obvious that everyone involved in making it had fun doing so, but one wonders if they considered the enjoyment of the actual movie goers. The stunts, for example, I love a good action, but I really am frustrated when all the hyped stunts are overly edited and processed with all the pretentious slow-motion tricks and multi-angle camera movements. It actually ruins any potential viewing enjoyment. The more slow motion and rapid cuts there are, the less impressed I am.	The music is also a lead character in this movie, because obviously the dialog is of no importance, otherwise they wouldn't drown out all the good jokes with the plodding music.	Let's see though, there were a few good moments: Bernie Mac, John Cleese and Crispin Glover are in it. Crispin is such a cool and creepy 'baddy'. Demi, well, Demi is her usual gorgeous liposucked enhanced self. Oh and Diaz, Barrymore, and Liu are in it too.	I suppose the best scene would be the fight at the cargo warehouse at the harbour between Seamus and his gang versus the Angels. Not that the scene really needed it, but the Prodigy song lands an additional punch to the already fiesty, dirty, brutal hand-to-hand brawl. Nice and gritty.	As for the DVD: No deleted scenes even though some do appear briefly in the outtakes or the Making Of documentaries. The Full Throttle Jukebox is silly, especially since the director and his music supervisor's comments are, like, you know, totally, cool, like, ya know.	Sure is fun to point out all the things wrong with this flick, aye? Now you probably wanna run out and buy it, right?
1,I want to make it clear that the docu-drama itself is a masterpiece of the genre and if I were rating this product on the content of the primary film alone it would get a full 5 stars. The extras which are listed in some of the other reviews are valuable as well.	My beef with this edition is first, I don't want or need a Blu-ray - I don't intend to switch anytime soon and, besides, it makes no difference to the quality of the classic episodes which were shot long before HD; second, I don't need another copy of "An Unearthly Child" or the original pilot as I already own them from a different DVD boxed set. I understand why they included it but many of us collecting the series probably bought the "Beginnings" boxed set. For my money, this set simply has more than I want to spend money on.	Having made my complaints, I want to add that for the new collector of Whoviana, this film is a must-have and "An Unearthly Child" is a nice companion piece so the curious can see why the show might have died if not for preemption by the JFK assassination. Actually, truth be told, it would probably have been a good idea to include the entire "Beginnings" collection which included "The Daleks" (which saved the show) and "The Edge of Destruction" (which is more like an episode of "The Twilight Zone" than a "Doctor Who". Together these would compliment "An Adventure In Space And Time". Other episodes depicted in the docu-drama and are available include "The Reign of Terror", "The Aztecs", "The Web Planet" and William Hartnell's last episode "The Tenth Planet" which has just been released this year on DVD.
1,This was very disappointing, its about a girl who committs suicide,An inspector (koo,l think he was spoofing an english 40 ,sdetective,not funny crap acting)comes to interview a family that are all suspects in her death?l think its suppose to be funny ,it was,nt,only bit l liked was donnie yen singing as a group,eric tsang just shouted loudly was,nt funny, neither were rest family !CRAP
1,Wasn't like I thought. ...it was not all that
1,I received it for Christmas and was very disappointed to see that it's just a repackage of Gwen's Fit Body Yoga, (which is excellent - but I don't need two copies).  I'm returning it and Gaiam goes on my naughty list...
1,This is a made of TV movie (TV-14) that was titled "Social Nightmare."		Cat (Kirsten Prout) is a popular girl who gets told secrets and is on her way to Brown University. Emily (Chloe Bridges) is her BFF who didn't get accepted to Brown. Mom (Daryl Hannah) is her number two BFF and is over protective. Suddenly Emily's world is turned upside down as someone has hacked into her account and posted those secrets as well as launched viscous attacks against other students. This isn't hard to figure out as there are less suspects than a Scooby-Doo episode.		I felt embarrassed watching the film, hoping it wasn't as easy to figure out as it let on. "Oh Please God, Please please, have a twist, even a stupid one. Make it the father we never saw,  the NNSA, or maybe aliens...anything but..."		The acting was remarkably good for an Asylum film. Unfortunately the plot wasn't.
1,The irreverent handling of The Commandments by this writer and cast is simply blasphemy.  If you believe in the Lord who gave us these laws, I strongly warn you to pass over this glorification of sin.  Also, it was not humorous, romantic, inspiring, etc.; it fails on all levels.
1,Too bad you can't give less than one star. As another reviewer mentioned, you can't understand most of what they are saying, since they wear masks through most of the movie. The lighting is terrible, and what passes as a plot is barely tolerable. I honestly can't believe we made it through the entire thing. It was probably two hours long, but it felt more like 37 hours.
1,I'm a fan of Tim & Kate and was looking forward to watching this after reading all of the other reviews......but......the movie put me to sleep!! It took me a month to watch the whole movie as I was determined to get through it. The best part of the movie was children's snake story Tim tells at the end of the movie that had everyone crying! See, I did actually watch it.
1,This is the problem with movies that fall into the public domain.  Anyone can release a copy and BUYER BEWARE!  This version is one of the worst DVDs I have ever seen.  You know right from the opening titles which don't fit within the frame.  The whole thing looks like it a videotape of  the film being projected onto a bed sheet.  .....
1,Filthy language. No thanks.
1,I suspect that the work out is good - I liked that they had one of the participants at a lower level than the others - but I found the interactions between the trainer and the participants to be demeaning.  Who needs that?  I bought it because it supposedly had a good boxing-type workout, but I didn't find that to be the case.  I'm going to give it away.
1,so so
1,My husband and I only watched this because of the provocative DVD cover and lived to regret it. Sure, Asia Argento looks sexy on the cover, giving the impression that this is some sort of sexy thriller. It really is neither - the sexy bits are all kind of fuzzy, and some of the sexy scenes end up being more brutal than sexy, and as for the thriller part, the meandering script adds more to one's confusion than answer questions.		The basic plot - Argento plays Sandra, an ex-hooker who has a sordid history with financier, Miles [Michael Madsen] who is based in Paris. Sandra needs money to buy herself a new life running a club partnership in Beijing, and this causes her to re-enter Miles' life as well as an Asian couple, Lester and Sue [Carl Ng and Kelly Lin]. A tryst gone wrong ends with an unexpected murder and Sandra finds herself on the run - taking off to Hong Kong where even more plot intrigues abound and the movie itself becomes a derailed mess.		There is even an appearance by Kim Gordon [of Sonic Youth] here - quite memorable if only because she is spewing Cantonese. At various points in the movie, we not only get an earful of English [and badly spoken English at times ], but also French and Cantonese.		As for eroticism, yes, there is a bit of that in the sex scenes between Sandra and Miles/ Sandra and Lester - but the chemistry really isn't very credible. What is credible though is Asia Argento's performance - she portrays a troubled woman convincingly, one who is able to exude a sense of the erotic whilst appearing demented. She really should be in better movies [not B-graders like this].		Final verdict: watchable for Argento's performance.
1,I can't believe Paramount let them do this to such a respected franchise. The original series, subsequent series, and movies stuck to the same themes. This is just a cartoon with people in it occasionally. There's hardly any acting or drama, just computer generated animation. They've sacrificed principle for profit. When they were writing it, they must have said, "Lets see how many special effects we can cram into two hours."		There are a few chuckles to be had, but overall I rate it one star and two thumbs down. If you can see if for free, it's OK, but I'm glad I didn't spend any money on it.
1,The one star rating is reserved primarily for the very impressive special effects and even better make-up. Rick Baker does it again!	However...	It's plainly obvious that Tim Burton clearly has a massive ego. It's also obvious that the studio is very stupid to believe that his whimsical vision can turn anything into box office gold. And it's more than obvious that there's ONLY ONE "Planet Of The Apes", directed by FRANKLIN J. SCHAFFNER, written by PIERRE BOULLE (and ROD SERLING) and starring CHARLTON HESTON, RODDY MCDOWALL, KIM HUNTER, etc.	This one? Boy, Burton better check his ego at the door for his next project and 20th Century Fox better prepare for a future in licking wallpaper.	Impressive production qualities, loud Dolby Digital and clever, quirky Burton-treated in-jokes do NOT a movie make. Neither do the actors. Helena Bonham Carter gives it a nice try, but it makes you crave for some sort of Merchant-Ivory substance (as opposed to her combining McDowall & Hunter all into one...talk about ambitious). Mark Wahlberg is a big non-existence. Tim Roth overacts. Estella Warren pouts and pouts and pouts. And, on the up side, there are some nice moments with Michael Duncan Clarke & David Warner, a terrific Paul Giamatti and, of course, Heston (in a much talked-about cameo).	Overall, the story is a contradictive muddle, never really making up its mind whether it wants to be science fiction or parody. And, if your knowledge is top-dog on the five "Apes" movies (from 1968 to 1974), I'm pretty sure you'll know which scenes he tried to "reimagine" to make this peacemeal claptrap.	Yeah, it's entertaining, but pretty unmemorable by the time it's over.	Stick with the originals. You'll be rewarded again and again. And you won't be disappointed.
1,ok mystery
1,This movie was so bad that my wife left half way through and my friend and I looked at each other afterward with apish grins wondering why she was so much smarter than we were. We should have aped her and left before we spent any more time monkeying around.	There was no character development and no character motivation. The makeup was great; the wire work was bad. The physics of the movie was absurd. I was particularly amused by how bad the crash landing on the Lincoln memorial was and how he just popped right out of the pod afterward, fresh as a daisy.	If you were planning to see this, I don't mean to throw a monkey wrench into your plans, but skip it and read the book instead.
1,This was actually painful to watch. I was so glad when it was over! Normally, when I hate something this much, I just turn it off and never go back, but I gave this one a chance and watched it all the way through.	The writing was awful, the characters completely one-dimensional, and I even felt sorry for Guy Pearce (I like him as an actor, but what the hell was he doing in this travesty?!) and the idiotic "chemistry" they tried to build between him and Maggie Grace's character.	I could see the potential in this movie, which I think is why I kept watching...hoping it would get interesting. The only time I was remotely entertained was when it was finally revealed what Guy Pearce's character's first name is. But even that was trite and contrived.	This might have been better in the hands of a better director, and I thought I saw Luc Besson's name in the credits...if he had directed it, it may have been better. But still, the dialogue was so freakin' lame it was unbearable, and I doubt even the most talented director could have saved it.	I can't recommend this movie to anyone, and all I can say is STAY AWAY!		You have been warned...
1,I saw this the other night on Showtime.  In the near future, prison inmates are given the opportunity to compete in a Survivor type reality show in order to gain their freedom.  They are released onto a small island, and if they can make it to the other side, they win.  Unfortunately for them the island is populated by zombies.  Don't let the cover art on the DVD fool you, that creature looks a thousand times better than anything you'll see in this movie.		So for 90 minutes we get to watch people running through the forest, betraying each other at every opportunity, and every 10 minutes or so one gets killed by a swarm of zombies.  There's little in the way of plot other than what I just outlined.  There's little character development, though for the most part I found about half the characters sympathetic.  The ending is pretty crummy as well, featuring the most undeveloped character in the whole movie, and it basically played out like any other five minutes of the movie.		So what does this movie have going for it?  Hot babes in sweaty tank tops.  If you like watching pretty girls run through the forest in sweaty tank tops, then you'll like this movie.  If not, well, this movie doesn't have much of anything to offer.  Personally I really like watching hot babes in sweaty tank tops run through the forest, so I may pick this up on DVD, but not for this price, LOL.  Maybe for a few bucks on Ebay.
1,Terrible movie, one of the worst.
1,Pretty forgettable.
1,Will Smith needs to stop trying to promote his son's acting career. This movie is one of the worst science fiction flicks I've ever seen. There is more entertainment watching a 24 hour marathon of SpongeBob Squarepants.
1,Final season ruin series
1,I love the Toxic avenger. I found the original to be a classic example of how to make a fun, clever and extremely gory laugh fest on a shoestring budget. I actually own the film on dvd. And, yes, I am aware that Troma is not the place to go if you're looking for class or fine art. This is a company that deliberately panders to the basest impulses of the filmgoing experience- sort of the home video version of "grindhouse cinema". But this time they've gone too far. Billed as the "real" sequel to the original film, "Citizen Toxie" manages to be boring, disgusting, loathsome, cheap ( I'm not kidding..even by Troma's low standards the effects are just awful in this film...and Toxie's makeup is the worst in the series..so bad that the design of this character from the original film looks oscar-worthy by comparison) and unredeemingly brazen as it revels in the most disgusting images put to film since "Pink Flamingoes". The "plot" involves Toxie being transported to an alternate dimension where everything is evil, while at the same time an evil Toxie from said dimension pops up in our world to terrorize Tromaville. I am a guy who can usually laugh off any image a movie has to throw at me, but  this flick had moments that honestly made me sick. Do yourself a favor and avoid this one like the plague that it is. You'd be better of just watching the original again. Way to corrupt your one legitmately interesting franchise, Troma. If this is your idea of stellar entertainment, your day has definitely passed.
1,As the other reviewer said, neither one of these movies is all that bad (I quite enjoyed them both) but Warner Brothers has become a bunch of liars as of late.  The back of the box CLEARLY states these are WIDESCREEN and the movies are NOT widescreen at all.  They are presented in crappy full frame and had they been marked correctly on the packaging I would have saved my hard earned money.
1,okay movie.
1,I bought this movie because of the reviews on here that were so overwhelmingly positive. Some of the other reviews on here mention God and give off the idea that this is a Christian film but they never once mention God, so when they say "Just Believe" you're left to wonder are they referring to believing in God, one's self, or something else entirely.  I guess it's just me but this movie leaves a lot to be desired. I loved the story line behind the movie but it leaves you with a lot of unanswered questions. The story line needs a lot more development. This really could have been a much better film with more character development. You kinda feel like it starts in the middle and abruptly ends. It was a clean movie and we need more of those but there are much better Christian family friendly movies out there for the price.
1,Just okay. You could tell what was going to happen all along.
1,Seriously...don't waste your time.  I don't think I was scared once in this terrible movie.  Total piece of garbage.  Can I have my money and the last hour and a half of my life back, please?
1,I am a Gozilla fan.  I own almost all the Gozilla dvds.  This one is the worst.  Gozilla doesn't even move other than Roaring still.  It is a "dead" Gozilla.
1,This was not a very good movie. Also Amazon says it is rated R when it is actually rated PG13. I would have never rented it if it was only PG13. I believe this is false advertising.		The plot was boring and inferior to movies like Sinister and The Ring. It will not stick with you. Mama is about as scary as a cavity.
1,This really stinks. Fox's explanation of "it's on tv, it's on the internet, blah blah blah", holds the person who likes to collect items such as this, and say that you own a copy. Their excuse is akin to saying you don't need to buy a book, when you can borrow it from a friend - it's not yours. Please reconsider, and resume the releases for a classic show that deserves to have all of it's episodes available on physical media.
1,After winning a lot of Oscars for the great "DANCE WITH WOLVES", Costner apparently wente berserk, and started to think he's the greatest actor of all mankind!  One of the movies that shows this new phase is this one. The general idea is good, tryin to make a "real" portrait of  Wearp, not a action-filled package as "TOMBSTONE". But Costner's  acting is arrogant, boring, in a way that eclypses all the merits of the  movie (mainly, Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday)
1,Didn't intend to watch it. Not my type of movie
1,I so wanted to watch this movie. The story began with exploration on one of Jupiter's moons. It fell to B status quickly and did not redeem itself.
1,Ok. Definilty better than most in the genre
1,GARBAGE
1,this dvd was returned for a refund because the leading actors were not the same as advertised on amazon.com.
1,Kind of a silly concept for a movie, wasn't very engaging and although I normally quite like Matt Damon as an action star, this movie left me kind of flat.
1,When "plot-less" movies come out now and then; Woody Allen's "Radio Days", or Fellini's "Amarcord" some of these films work (like the two I mentioned) but some don't. When you make a career out of making films like that, like Altman has, your films usually become hit or miss. Movies that are structured like this can be praised or criticized for the same reasons. Either you can enjoy some of the bits, like the acting between certain people, and think some scenes work and some didn't, but you still enjoyed yourself. Or the other way to look at it is; you didn't like the fact that there's no central charcaters, no real relationship between the viewer and the actors involved. And, it doesn't feel "complete".  Now, I'm not a really big fan of Altman's. I'm just starting to get into his films. Some of his movies work like "M.A.S.H", and "The Player", and the more recent "Dr. T & The Women". Others don't work as well such as "Popeye", what was he thinking!! And this film. The real problems with this movie are the fact that number one it carries no energy. It just lags around, trying to pick up some steam only it never does. The characters are not real at all, but, I'll excuse that because after all this is a comedy. Are the characters in "Blazing Saddles" or "Scary Movie" real? No! The movie takes on more that it could handled. There were certain things that only could of made this film work. Like the whole story involving Rupert Everett (Jack Lowenthal) selling his mother's Anouk Aimee (Simone Lowenthal) fashion company. They could of been negotiating and Simone doesn't like what she's hearing and starts yelling as loud as she could while the models are on the runway. That could of been funny. But no time is paid to that part of the story. It's one scene. In one short scene they talk about it, and we never hear them mention it again. Then there was the fashion editors who wanted to get a photographer. They could of worked a lot more on this part of the movie. Or the stuff involving Sophia Loren (Isabella da la Fontaine), Marcello Mastroianni (Sergio) and Jean-Pierre Cassel (Oliver de la Fontaine) if they would of work it so what happens, happens while the show is going on, that could of been interesting also. But the script by Altman and Barbara Shulgasser barely touches these themes. Too many scenes don't work, it just becomes boring after a while. For older movie fans, try to remember those all-star cast movies of the 60's. Where there wasn't really a plot, but, it was all just an excuse to get a bunch of famous people in a movie, think about "What's New Pussycat" or "Casino Royale". That's sorta what this movie is like, without the laughs. We see a lot of famous people like Kim Basinger, Julia Roberts, Tim Robbins, Terri Garr, Danny Aiello, Tracey Ullman, Sally Kellerman, Lyle Lovett(Why is he even in this?  lol), Forest Whitaker and Laren Bacall(!). And if you were to ask me why. I wouldn't be able to answer you, there're just there to be there. The movie also has a score by Michel Legrand (Watch What Happens, What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life?). Really bad movie by Altman, truly one of the worst movies of the year it came out.
1,Bot my kinda movie only watched about ten minutes and switched
1,Great cast dragged down and dumbed by a slow crawling script.  If you watch it make sure you have a pot of coffee before hand or your likely to fall asleep.  There is some pretty Newfoundland scenery however.
1,The movie Iron man 3 is great. However, this 3D Blu-ray did not play correctly on my Sony 3D HDTV and 3D Blu-ray. It kept skipping and was jerky. I have found that the 3D movies have NOT caught up with the technology of the 3D hardware. I also purchased the new Star Trek movie and it did the same "jerky motion" thing. It was giving me a headache. However, the 3D Cirque du Soliel 3D movies work fantastic! I was again disappointed that a big movie like Iron man 3 still has not worked out the qinks in their 3D Blu-ray technology.  I paid for 3D and ended up seeing the 2D version. This sucks!
1,Slime City (Greg Lamberson, 1988)		If you're a fan of cult horror films, you've probably heard of Street Trash, an infamous 1987 splatter comedy by Mike Muro. The year after, sleaze merchant Greg Lamberson made his debut with Slime City, a picture that rips off Street Trash in every conceivable way save the plot. Which, if you think about it, is kind of impressive; you take everything else from a movie and attach a completely different plot to it? I like that. Not enough to change my original rating, because it's still a low-budget piece of tripe with no worthwhile actors, fumble-fingered direction, and the most godawful soundtrack this side of Ravenous, but you've got to admire the guy's gall.		Plot: Alex (Robert C. Sabin, who aside from debuting in I Was a Teenage Zombie, has appeared in nothing but Lambersom flicks) moves into a new apartment in a not-so-good neighborhood. On the way in, Alex and his pal Jerry (T. J. Merrick, who never acted again) are greeted by Nicole (Ghoul School's Mary Huner), and they both immediately fall in lust. Which makes life kind of tough for Alex, who has a girlfriend (also played by Huner!) who just won't go there. So he's trying to keep his hands off his new neighbor, but she's coming on strong. Meanwhile, Roman (Dennis Embry, who also never acted again), who lives upstairs, invites Alex up for a meal and feeds him something Roman calls "Himalayan yogurt."It's not, of course; in fact, when Alex wakes up the next morning, he's covered in slime and has an almost irresistible urge to go out and kill people. Obviously, there's something very wrong going on in this building besides the rent-control corruption...		That Lamberson was able to lure Kealan Patrick Burke, one of the fastest-rising horror authors on the planet, to star in the sequel, 2010's Slime City Massacre (which I haven't seen yet), is some testament as to the lasting effect this movie has had, on at least one consciousness anyway. But man, is this movie awful. The acting isn't all that far above grade-school level, the direction not any better. Even the lighting is bad enough that there are times the movie looks as if it was shot on DV (and I don't mean that as a compliment). This is an amateur film in every respect, and not a good one at that. (Charles Pinion released Twisted Issues the same year, also an amateur film, but so much better than this.) You may want to watch it if you stumble across it just for some of the unintentional hilarity, but you'll regret that you wasted ninety minutes of your life on it afterwards. *
1,Within the first 30 minutes of the film I thought I was watching another sequel or an imitation of the Chronicles of Narnia. Though some of the characters were interesting I found Great and Powerful Oz to be very un-original. James Franco's character is to Oz what the children were to Narnia in the Chronicles of Narnia. There is a prophecy....A chosen one foretold to come and save Oz from a witch....My wife and I saw it without the kids and glad we did because this movie is very suspensful and what I would call downright wicked at times with regard to the wicked witch played by Mila Kunis. There was a woman in the theater with small children who had to leave the theatre at one point because the scenes were very scary for the children she brought in the 5 to 6 yr old range. There were scenes that moments after I heard multiple children crying in the theater.
1,Anybody notice that the the entire plot of this movie was was stolen from Pixar's Cars? Hotshot drives through backwater town, gets sentenced to community service, has an epiphany, gets wisdom wisdomfetcrom an old doc,  hooks up with an amalgam of Mater and the girl car. I mean, sure it's a familiar story, but this is basically just the live action version of Cars. Plus some heavy handed, completely unsubtle preachiness.
1,Couldn't make it all the way through, I was bored out of my mind.  Maybe, like other Ferrell movies, it will grow on me and I'll increase the stars later.
1,Take six competent singers, a not overly-conceptual concept production, an established conductor and world-class orchestra, a young stage director cutting his chops, and you have a challenging evening of musical theater.  But record a large part of each act in startling, unflattering close-ups with hand-held, jolting cameras jumping between natural color and the nuclear green glow of night vision and you have a VERY annoying and disappointing viewing experience. Wagner's most intimate and intense love story was evidently not dumped on heavily enough by stage director Olivier Py for the label's taste; the cretinous video director Andy Sommer was engaged to pull the performance down to the sad level of eurotrash productions currently sweeping the continent.		What frustrates in the videography most of all is that one never has a clear concept of the stage space.  It wasn't until watching the documentary on the production that I found out there was actually a model ship sailing from one side of the stage to the other in Act I.  The bizarre angles are particularly puerile in the first act;  Act II is almost steady by comparison, and much is lost from upstage in Act III.  After viewing this DVD one could actually go to a live revival of the production and see it for the first time.		Musically, the revelation of the performance is the handsome American tenor Clifton Forbis, whose Baritone-like timbre and even production in all registers make him an admirable and heroic Tristan.  Showing no signs of vocal fatigue in the grueling marathon that is Act III, his voice only squeaks once in the frenzied last scene of Act II.  His total fearlessness in singing the role allows him to devote more energy to character refinement, which is rare among today's Tristans.  His German diction is flawless as well. I won't consider him the great white Heldentenor, though, until I see his Siegfried.		Also impressive is the American soprano Jeanne-Michele Charbonnet as Isolde.  She's a bit over the top with the teeth-gnashing in the first act, but delivers a performance varied in expression, dynamics and intensity.  Her post-potion personality seems to be the one closest to her true self, for the high C she sings in Act II is effortless compared with the forced one she sings in the Narrative/Curse of Act I.  She blends well vocally with Tristan, and actually KISSES him passionately and repeatedly, which is something you don't see often.  Unfortunately, by the time the Liebestod comes around, she has already spent her vocal capital.  Her final phrases are weak, flat, and flaccid, but she does manage to sing a beautiful last note on "Lust," even though it is mezzo forte (instead of pianissimo).		Mihoko Fujimara has a lovely voice, although it is only about half the size needed to sing Brangaene properly. As Koenig Marke, Alfred Reiter is lanky and melancholic, and has a smoothness to his not-so-deep bass voice that is fitting for the concept of his role as an ineffectual weakling.  Albert Dohmen wins the testosterone award for his swaggering Kurwenal with a voice that cuts like steel.  Do you really care about Melot?		I had truly expected more nuance from conductor Armin Jordan, who is by no means a stranger to Wagner.  All tempos are on the fast side, which is fine if you can still draw the necessary tension, beauty, and wonder from the score.  But all too often he seemed to be watching the clock.  I've always tended to speculate on what kind of lovers conductors are/were from the way they direct/directed the Liebestod, Wagner's musical depiction of orgasm.  M. Jordan, in contradistinction to his advanced age, would tend to border on the slam-bam-thank-you-ma'am.  (Or, perhaps he's just trying to help out his failing Isolde.)		The final image we get on the DVD is a Drer-like one of the conductor's uplifted hands with baton pointing toward the stage during the orchestral postlude, leading us to ask, "What the hell is up with Isolde?"  Again, the documentary is useful for actually being able to see what she's doing during the last bars of the piece.		The stage director, M. Py, states in the extras that Tristan and Isolde is a morbid opera about teenage suicide.  If only it could have been captured that way on DVD, instead of like some ineffably wretched teen video game.
1,movie was damage
1,It seemed very silly so I turned it off.
1,plot was ok but poor acting.
1,Almost at the end of the move then there is no sound. The best part and you can't hear anything.
1,I am glad I have never purchased this dog. The acting is fair but the movie is slow and never caught my attention. The death of one of the main characters was pretty bad. I rented this through Red Box and felt the $1 price was a waste.
1,Sadly, the trailer for this movie shows it all, the rest of the film dragging out like some kiddie story that never takes off.  The premise is promising, a sleeper agent suddenly awakened while he works in the local 7-11.  Of course, he's clueless and has now idea why he is filled with Jason-Bourne-like abilities, nor why people are after him...except, this is all supposed to be a comedy.  And that might be the problem, for this film can't decide whether to take things seriously or not, often drifting off into such over-played roles that you also begin to drift off; where exactly are the clips you saw in the previews (about 40 minutes in so it's a bit of slog to get there).  Cute enough if you're totally out of other things to watch...but not that cute.  Might want to skip this one, despite the trailer....
1,Very poorly acted and amateurishly filmed. Could have been interesting if the writer/director hadn't have tried to be artsy.
1,I give this movie one star for Wes Ramsey (Bram Stoker) who I kept wishing, as he was running across Europe, would run into a better movie. He was the one bright spot in the whole thing. There was only one segment out of Stoker's short story, and that was Bram being chased by the dog (a Rottweiler) which should have been a wolf(couldn't they even get a German Shepherd to be a fake wolf?) and then rescued. Andrew Bryniarski was one of the most unappealing Draculas I've ever seen. To the writer's credit, they did try to insert a bit from Stoker's book for Dracula to say, his speech where he's talking about himself: "we have a right to be proud...the Ugric tribe bore down from Iceland, etc.", but it was so garbled you could hardly understand what he was saying. He practically threw that speech away, he rushed through it so quickly.  And to be a bit picky-when was this movie set? Costumes were from the 1850s-90s. Women's hair was all wrong, they NEVER wore it loose during these years. And the French people in the cabin talked about the Bastille and the Revolution. Just how old were these people if it was even set in 1850? I agree with another reviewer about the Count's castle being a mausoleum?? uh-huh. Also, Dracula scorned Stoker's use of mortal weapons but later didn't seem to mind picking up a sword to fight Admiral Murray.  And for the record, Bram Stoker's wife's name was Florence. If you don't know anything about Stoker or Dracula, the book or short story and just want to watch a vampire flick, you might not mind it. However, if you do, this movie is just irritating because it could have been SO much better, so just skip it.
1,No closed caption for the deaf !!!  No caption is a discrimination against hearing impaired or deaf  The company have no heart for deaf or hard of hearing
1,The negative reviews were right. I was disappointed. And my bar for these cute chick flicks is set pretty low.
1,Interesting premise of a town cut off from the outside world, which is sparsely populated by humans, but busting at the seams with vampires. Very poor acting and poor sound quality make it a waste of money to rent, and a waste of time to watch. I love vampire movies that include at least good acting, good sound quality and a good plot; however, "Mostly Dead" is a flop!
1,Let me start by saying that everyone knows that Rachel is an amazing performer and she practically steals the show at Bellydance superstars, which is why I was so excited to get her DVD, but it was a dissapointment to her fans.		I also had a problem with the performance editing, it does not capture her beautiful dance, but I also was dissapointed with the rest of the DVD. I found it very cold, devoid of personality. Rachel does a voice-over and she has a sour expression on her face the whole time, not like how sensual I remember her in the performance. Half of the instruction is yoga and not bellydance yoga, but straight forward yoga, which would be fine if she told you how this would help your bellydance practice or a to perform a particular move. I found the yoga out of place and with all the great yoga videos out there, unnecessary. However the biggest dissapointment is she doesn't share her secrets to her dancing. She breaks down the moves thoroughly, but does not explain why the moves look so different when she does them.
1,Fantastic..if you're a 13 yr old girl with the brains of an avocado. This melodramatic, over-narrated drivel never stopped making me gasp in amazement with its tawdry attempts to jerk cheesy tears from the neighbor's Chihuahua ( about the only living creature within 500 yards of my computer that actually might get some emotional response to this movie ). Will Smith as Lucifer ?!? Oh puhleaze...absolutely pathetic. He was about as menacing as Mr Rodgers with earrings. This long drawn out movie is all about saving 1 little girl from cancer....uhm...so where is this all supposed to make a difference? I like Colin Farell but damn...I sure hope they paid him a lot of money for this. They should have just made this into a pop-up book and be done with it.
1,No depth. Just an endless string of computer generated special effects. The acting and dialogue were pure sap. 90% of the plot was simply fighting, and boring at that. If you liked the previous ones, don't ruin your happy memories on this weak contender.
1,There were a lot of good reviews for this film, and my wife and I love Jane Austen books and film adaptations, so it was a no-brainer. However, the film failed to live up to its excellent premise.	Jane Austen-enthusiasts deserve a true parody, because their numbers are legion and they truly would at least attempt to speak and act period-appropriate and with the wit with which Austen imbues her characters. However, much "humor" in this piece is about how only the main protagonist (and perhaps the Mr. Darcy figure) have even a basic understanding of Austen's world and concerns. The other two guests at Austenland are slobbering for man-flesh. The joke of "sex-starved unattractive woman hitting on beefcake" is as old as Aristophanes, but it's not really Austen, is it? The Darcy character is nicely played and Bret of "Flight Of the Conchords" is also very good, and I did enjoy the final rom-com ending. I could suspend my disbelief for that because that's what one does in rom-coms, but my disbelief in the ham-handed execution of the main plot points of the film was too great to be suspended. I would give this maybe 3 stars, but I wanted to warn true Austenites away.
1,Mega fox is not an actress. Will Arnett should known better. Utter garbage. I'm really disappointed. Where's the camp? The Ninja Rap?
1,I like Rodney Yee but I was disappointed in this dvd.  I was looking for a mix of short practices that I could fit into a busy day but the practices on this dvd are divided by poses so instead of a quick balanced routine, one routine is all twisting poses, one is all standing poses, etc.  Not at all what I was looking for.
1,not good very bad movie. I mean ok twist but still not as good as the first one
1,This was one of the worst movie ever made to cinema. I was suprised that this film didn't go straight dvd. Do not waste your money on this garbage. If you must see it, rent it.
1,another student consel
1,Let me say that I had purchased these exact same disks on another site because, like everyone else here, I was furious at the prices that Paramount is selling them at and the site claimed that the disks were the complete set and were about half the cost. Well, as they say, I got what I had paid for: about half the series. Almost all of the episodes were edited, with parts (sometimes very important to the story details) cut out. The picture quality was blurry at best, often very dark, and many times the disks were completely unreadable for several episodes and even whole disks! The packaging was very sloppy, with disks from different seasons all lumped together and no episode guides. This purchase was beyond disappointing to me and please don't let it happen to you. I now have to buy the series again on Amazon from a REAL vendeur and I will have lost quite a bit of money, but I learned a lesson. If you really love this series (and I do, it's my favourite of all the Treks) and want to enjoy it in its entirity (why else would you buy it at all?), then suck it up and pay for the real thing. If, like another reviewer had written, you just want a taste for the series and want to see an overview, then simply set your recording device to Spike and get the episodes there. Either way, don't waste your money on these.
1,Couldn't get through more than about 1/2 hour of this. Liked the other movies in the series, but this simply was incoherent. Probably better in book form. Would make more sense.
1,Serious minded but painfully tedious thriller about a woman who goes to a seaside house with her sister after a traumatic event at her mom's that we see larger and larger snippets of as the movie progresses.  This was originally called Not Alone which isn't a great title but The Haunting of Ellie Rose was a major miscalculation since it gives away the movie's biggest twist.		In any case, this hopelessly muddled film suggests that Ellie was abused by her husband, or molested as a child, or that she and her sister were molested as children--but Ellie turns out to not be the most reliable or honest heroine, so it's hard to say what, if anything, is the reason for everything that is going on in this movie.  The only certain thing is that this is one seriously long slog of an 80 minute film that offers no suspense or dramatic interest--although the acting and evocation of a 1950's setting are pretty impressive for what was likely a pretty low budget movie.  Still, The Haunting of Ellie Rose is flat out boring, despite its genuine ambition, never managing to create a lead character we care about or understand, a story that is mildly involving or even a single scene that generates a little tension.  Ellie Rose is a depressing misfire.
1,Boring! what a waste of time. purely low level . not much to see here. girls are ok. but they must get bored	filming this. really not a turn on. I find Peach dvd's not worth much time or money.
1,----------------------------------------	Public service announcement before I begin review.  Toonami is back!!!  Airs on Saturday Midnight, well technically Sunday, from 12:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m., with an encore beginning at 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.  Tune in and support it.  Now on to my review.	----------------------------------------		***Brief Review***		I know there are overall positive reviews for this movie.  This however is one of those times where I just don't see it.  (I can already feel a disturbance in the force, and the negative votes and comments coming).		Why did I not like this film?  For one, it's a strait out comedy.  Tom Cruise is killing people, shoting guns, and driving cars incredibly fast, all the while cracking jokes to Cameron Diaz.  He's hanging upside down once, getting ready to get tortured and all the while he keeps smiling and saying "Don't Worry June" we're almost home free.  The next minute they are in a plane, the next minute bailing out of said plane, and finally on a remote tropical island.  Frankly I just found the whole experience quite unwatchable.		Tom in this film is like every spy/action character he's ever played rolled into one, with a huge dash of bad comedy thrown in.  Diaz just screams the whole movie and is dragged from one place to the other by Cruise.		What's the story/premise?  Your guess is as good as mine.  Something about a cold fusion battery or something... Who knows.		Let me reiterate, this is my opinion of this film.  If you watched this and thought this was the best movie ever, that's your opinion.  I personally found it a chore to finish, and it took a while for me to finally to complete the whole thing.		Also it rented TERRIBLE.  Nobody wanted to watch it, we had like 40 copies of this thing and they just sat on the shelf.  I had to lie and tell people that Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz were naked in it for it to rent at all, nah I didn't really, but I probably should have.		---In Conclusion---		A solid pass in my humble opinion.  Nothing memorable at all.  Still interested?  All I can say then is it's probably in the bargin bin at Wal-Mart or FYE, check there and PLEASE don't pay more than 5 bucks for it.  Back when I was at the video store, we had to sell it for 2.99 and they still were hard to get rid of.		Well, that's my opinion of this film.  If your a die hard Tom fan and I offended you, all I can say is ask youself WWTCD?  He would probably say he didn't like 'Knight & Day' much either and to go watch his new rock & roll movie...
1,Watched it, but was not really into it.
1,Two percent of the U.S. population is Jewish but half or more of the meshuga/crazy in some way people in Hollywood movies are Jewish.	Oy vey.
1,Love Jennifer but the plot is weak. A "B" movie at best.
1,Stupid, foul language was unnecessary.
1,This movie was really stupid. I thought it would be neat to watch this movie, and I love the 3D look, but this was horrid. I wouldn't recommend this movie but the music was not bad.
1,I'm sadly disappointed in this DVD and wish I would have read the negative reviews before purchasing it. First off, how is it advertised as "two 45-minute workouts" when NEITHER workout is even close to 45 minutes long? I wanted longer workouts because I've worked my way up to picking two sessions from Jillian's 30 Day Shred, Yoga Meltdown, Killer Buns, or Ripped in 30 (which are all fabulous DVDs).		Workout one, I felt was an odd combination of moves that didn't really seem to do anything for me, mixed in with some good stuff. But the odd moves left me feeling bored. For example; there's one move where you're in a squat and waving your arms back and forth slowly in front of your face, apparently some Brazilian martial arts thing. And another one where you just step back, swing one arm up to block your face, and swing your other arm behind you. It's not even as challenging as Jillian's typical warm-up moves like jumping jacks or high kicks. Jillian doesn't explain the format on the moves like she usually does, but this didn't bother me because I was able to follow along after a few reps.		The second workout, I actually took issue with a few of the moves because I don't think that the average person without gymnastics training could actually complete them without hurting themselves in the process of learning them. I've done the advanced versions of the other Jillian DVDs I have, and sometimes it takes me a few weeks to work up to the advanced version, especially on the yoga poses. But here's a move I would never attempt: Basheera was in a pose with her feet flat on the floor, hands flat on the floor with fingertips pointing towards her feet, and whole body arched in an upside down "u" shape with belly pointing towards the sky. How on earth does a person even try that? And if you don't have the strength for it or your hands slip, you'll crash down onto your head, which seems extremely risky! However, as in workout one, there were a couple good redeeming moves, such as the Russian twist, which I'll incorporate into my workout routine.		I won't return this DVD, but I'm not planning to work out to it like I do the other Jillian DVDs, except to get a couple good moves from it.
1,This was not a typical Denise Austin workout video (and I would know, I've done most everything she has put out since the early 90's) moves are repetitive, - your up, your down, your in every position and nothing flows. I got so tired of T-stand I just stopped doing it. Since opened videos are non-returnable, this one will go in my yardsale pile.
1,It depends how many of these kind of films you have seen before, but I found it terrible.	The film seems more about Italian landscape and drinking coffee than anything else.	The acting at one point was terrible. Here is an example.		George Clooney is minding his own business having a coffee (what else ?) in a coffee bar.	His prostitute friend and her friend both drop in on the off chance.	She asks him if they want to meet that night. Here is the dialogue:		Pros: Where shall we meet ?	long silence	George. The usual place	long silence	Protitute: where is that ?	even longer stoney silence	george looks at her friend. Her friend smiles in embarassment.	george: Lets meet somewhere new	prostitute: ok	the prostitute and friend leave the coffee bar		end of scene.		I had to cringe. The film is just full of these kind of disjointed scenes.	The best way to describe it is like the Bourne supremacy but without the action and suspense.		Sorry two thumbs down.
1,PEW!!
1,Horribly written movie for a release date of 2010. In the dialogue, a crew member is elated because it was the first time anyone had ever achieved "Warp drive." ...Wow....the graphics in the trailer looked interesting , but the 4 star rating influenced me to rent the movie. I'm guessing that the writer had ADHD and was maybe 14 years old? ...Just plain poorly done. I had to turn it off....
1,wouldn't watch this again or tell anyone else to watch it. I could hardly get through it myself! very dumb!
1,This is not a Trek film.  This is not the intelligent show/movie I have watched for 30+ years.  This is 'Fast and Furious' in space.  The maker of this trash, I will not pay him the coutesy of naming him, has completely ignored Gene Rodenberry's vision.  He has ignored decades of work and lore.  He has made his own Sci-fi movie, and that is fine; but why did he have to destroy Star Trek to do it?		Simple: marketing.		By slapping the title 'Star Trek' on this pile of garbage he lures in fans from an established franchise.  If this movie had been called something else it would have failed, as it should have.		Let's examine the film's contradictions:	1) Kirk goes from juvenile delinquent to Starfleet Cadet over-night, amazing!  I wonder why we do not hear about Anapolis candidates who fit this model...oh, because its nonesense	2) Starfleet chooses to send an elderly, aged AMBASSADOR Spock on a crucial mission to save Romulus from it's dying star at a time when dozens of Star Fleet officers, who were better qualified to do so, would have been avaiable.	3) Our 'Bad Guy' is a miner...PATHETIC	4) Why change the warp engines?  Now they have thrust ejecting from the rear of the nacelles?  The moron that made this film did not take the time to do ANY research else he would have known that they do not use this method of propulsion.	5) Why change the way the weapons work on the starships?  It wasn't broke why did you 'fix' it?	6) 'Kirk' just happens to be ejected on the exact barren world that Spock landed on?  Give me a break.	7) 'Kirk' and 'Scotty' are able to beam across billions of miles onto a starship moving at warp?  This is not possible until well into The Next Generation era.  Even in this film it is established that it is difficult to beam a falling object, i.e. one with momentum, so how is it suddenly so easy to do this?	8) If you can beam across several lightyears of space why do you need ships?  The 'creator' of this film is truly an idiot.	9) The new hand phasers spin their fronts, why?  This chance is plain silly.  It serves no purpose other than to further modify that which did not need modification.	10) 'Kirk' is able to convince 'Spock' to relinquish his command by using 30 seconds of verbal goading?  You have got to be kidding me.	11)  Now a third year cadet is in command of the fleet's flagship.  Do I have to say it.	12) The Coup de grace: said Third year cadet 'Kirk' (I use quotes to denote his status as a fake or psuedo version of the REAL character) is now promoted directly to CAPTAIN!  This is off-the-scale stupid.  This thug doesn't even graduate from the Academy and jumps over 10 years of his career and at least four grades of rank.  I almost threw my beer at the screen when I saw this (Movie Tavern you can order beer there).		Let's also note how clumsy and foolish the Kobiashi Maru scene is.  This is a pivotal moment in 'Kirk's' career and the monkey-in-charge treats it like a scene from Animal House.		I used to say, "bad Star Trek is better than no Star Trek."  I think I am going to retire that phrase, even though this terrible film is not really a Trek film.  It has more in common with The Transporter than it does with The Wrath of Khan.		If this fool is allowed to make more trash like this Star Trek has a bleak future.
1,HORRENDOUS- What can be seen on our streets/in our schools every day...why pay for/be'enertained'by/ this???
1,Can't believe I bought this. Would be awful even if I hadn't seen the original to compare it to. Sloppily directed and cheap looking. Sam Rockwell isn't even trying. This Poltergeist has no idea what scares you. Don't let the cheap price suck you in.
1,Ok
1,Not a good one - my kids and me didn't found our selves... The Muppet had a better movies - if you have more options - go there...
1,The action was good, the 3D effects were OK, but if you are looking for a movie where the entire plot doesn't require you to suspend your disbelief the entire film, then you should take a pass on this film. I really like the Rock, but really disliked this film.
1,Absolutely terrible.  Loved the scene where Holmes is being choked to death, and choked to death, and choked to death, and ... Yawn!
1,Good movie to put on when you want to take a nap.
1,<<SPOILER>>  <<SPOILER>>  <<SPOILER>>  <<SPOILER>>  <<SPOILER>>		Short_N_Sweet: a mindless string of action sequences w/exceedingly little dialogue/plot development. A two hour film filled w/too ridiculous to believe stunts. The kicker is Connor getting a 2" wide steel bar rammed through his spinal column, & supposedly his heart. It's OK, though... He still walks w/assistance to a far away helicopter, undergoes emergency cardio-thoracic surgery in the dusty wide open desert. Then receives a heart transplant... Yeah, suuuuuuuuuuuuuuure. Bale was great in Batman. His performance here is uninspired & flat. This film is way too short on character/plot substance, & far too laden w/mindless action. I'm glad I only wasted $3.00 on a rental.
1,I  couldn't  get  into  it with  all  men -  but  I  will  try  again  because  I've  heard  good  reviews .
1,This movie is not bad. That would be good. Is awful. It sucks. It stinks to heaven. The world has never experienced such a dog since Attila the Hun.		No plot. No story. Lots and lots a talented people wasted. Peter Sellers, why you? And Orson Welles? Gimme a break! Beautiful Ursula. Well, perhaps the only thing worth watching there. Et tu, Woody Allen? Maybe he needed the money. Who knows? And the impossible end. Oh, Lord, they even throw in the U.S. Cavalry. But no, if you still want to watch this disaster, do it at your own risk. It may kill you, really: it's that bad.
1,Hard to fathom why there's no Region 1 DVD of this film available.  I don't mind a non-English version, though subtitles would be nice, but this one begs to be given the Criterion treatment, or at least MOD.  Look to it, Hollywood sophistos!  Give those young lawyers some work to do!
1,I only watched Disc #1 and then quit. Too boring for me. I had to fast forward through most of it. Even listening to some of the commentary didn't help get me interested. The characters are just too bland or over-the-top for my liking.		Although I'm a Debrah Farentino fan, not even her hot body could keep me hooked on this quirky drivel. I could see myself watching this if there were only a few tv shows released on Dvd. Instead, I'll be watching "The 4400", Season 1, Disc #2. It's not fantastic, but it does interest and entertain me long enough to keep me watching. I also enjoy "Stargate Atlantis", "Curb Your Enthusiasm" and Season #2 of "Weeds". I hate "Babylon 5".		I also recently saw "Sliders" Season 1-Disc #1(first few episodes) and found them mostly painful to watch. I remember enjoying the later season's episodes better (many years ago), but was shocked at how bad the early ones look to me now. They just don't hold up well, over time (but I guess they knew that would happen).		"Eureka" also shocked me. I wasn't expecting it to be so bland. With so many positive reviews, I'm obviously in the minority, but I still think you're all nuts for liking this so much. It's going on my list of 'Most Overated Tv shows', along with "Lost"-Season 2 and beyond. I guess we all can't have good taste. Just kidding...I think.
1,UGH!
1,Give Myrick and Sanchez credit. They found a gimmick that worked and milked it for a LOT of money. Like the inventors of the hoola hoop, the pet rock, and the web tailgate for pick up trucks, and, more specifically, Tom Lofton, they cashed in. P.T. Barnum would have been proud of them.	This movie will probably go down as the "Billy Jack" of the 1990s. If you have not watched Billy Jack, watch it first before you consider watching Blair Witch Project.	Essentially, this flick goes nowhere and takes 90 minutes to get there. Some say that one has to use one's imagination to really enjoy this movie. Maybe so, but not THAT much. If you find this movie frightening, you have lived a very sheltered life...
1,I did watch Resident Evil: Apocalypse back when it was in theaters & I rather enjoyed it! this movie, I just got to today & found myself wondering what the hell happened. the movie is just so much stupider then the second one. I found myself laughing at parts where we're "supposed to be scared". the acting is just not that good, it's corny as hell. hasn't anyone in this film ever heard of a zombie before? if a zombie was coming at you, would you lower your weapon or blast it apart? like, what are they doing? I got so mad at this film cause it's so stupid. why do the characters have to be so dumb? I'll blame the writers, the director's for this. Resident Evil is not worth your time or money. I found the second one more enjoyable for some reason. so please, look elsewhere. I'd be more entertained by a fish swimming in circles.
1,Perched stupidly between an austere prestige picture and a tempestuous bodice ripper, "The Other Boleyn Girl" is little more than a posturing goof ball that happens to feature a semi-decent turn from Natalie Portman. Why this movie was made, and the purpose of its tone, is beyond me. It almost makes "Marie Antoinette" look restrained.		Based on Phillppa Gregory's novel, which pads the story of Henry VIII and his marriage to Anne Boleyn - as if the split from the Catholic Church and Boleyn's eventual beheading needed it - "The Other Boleyn Girl" introduces us to Anne's moon-faced, guileless sister, Mary (Scarlett Johansson).  It's she, not Anne, who's the first pawn in Sir Thomas Boleyn's plan to ensnare Henry (Eric Bana) and cement the family's royal bloodlines. It's Mary who goes to court, bringing Anne in tow. Mary, who drops her sap of a husband to crawl into the king's bed.  Mary, who bears the son that Henry's first wife, Catherine of Aragon, couldn't provide.		But Anne only trails until halftime, so to speak, returning from a short exile in France to pour all kinds of sugar on the grim, sad-faced Henry while Mary's bed-ridden, awaiting her child. Anne taunts Mary with this knowledge as payback for Mary's betrayal during Anne's first, "secret" marriage. According to Peter Morgan's screenplay, Anne's hard-to-get routine is more or less the source of the great schism between Henry's England and the Catholic Church. When the king finally "has" Anne, it's in a fit of petulant  rage after a scolding from wife Catherine. The movie's final act concerns Anne's rule as queen and her eventual execution.		How accurate is any of this? Who knows. History generally tells us that Mary got around quite a bit more than Anne did in the French courts; a sweet simpleton she was not. Gregory's book  acknowledges this; the movie does not. The bigger problem lies in Justin Chadwick's oppressive direction, which throws an odd, dark tint on the visuals and the portentous music over too many scenes. That's a holdover from the movie's Oscar hopes - dashed once it became clear "The Other Boleyn Girl" has all kinds of lapses and absurdities, not the least of which features Mary riding alone on horseback, presumably for days, to save her sister's life, and walking out of the castle with Anne's daughter Elizabeth to ride that same horse back home.		Gregory's novel doesn't exactly have a healthy scorn of Henry's intelligence, but, as Bana plays him, Henry's a chiseled stud with a Dom DeLuise beard and a pea brain. The man was indeed an oaf, but history's shown him to be a brilliant one: A musician, a poet and an accomplished thinker. Henry enjoyed as much power, if not more, than any royal before or since. The movie doesn't reflect it. Bana, a dark-eyed brooder, is the wrong fit for the role.		Portman, however, makes an intriguing Anne. Her looks fit the paintings of the queen to some extent, and the actor manages to suppress that giant, unflattering grin of hers. Portman's  never going to be a particularly great actor - charmed lives such as hers rarely produce the needed range - but she's endearing in her own way, and the role of Anne lets her try on manipulation. It suits her, as does the trappings of the time period: Wardrobe, accents, etc. Better than Kirsten Dunst, anyhow.		And, frankly, Johansson, who glides through her scenes with her trademark opacity. We don't find out what makes Mary tick so much we hear the wind blowing through her ears. Although Mary smartens up by the end of the picture, she always seems a little slow on the uptake, and Johansson's bewildered, open-mouthed persona transforms virtue into the addled gaze of a milquetoast. It worked five years ago in "Girl With A Pearl Earring;" it's growing a little old now.
1,Thanks for shipping quickly. I am into so bad its good movies, but this pile stinks.
1,Give me a break. The movie is part comedy, part tragedy, part silly, and very overacted. What's up with 90% of the movie being about Gay Sex. I thought it was about a woman that could not have an orgasm. Not worth the money. But, thanks to the actors for giving a good try.
1,I am not a fan of this movie in the least bit. It was horrible and I am sad I wasted money and time watching it
1,I don't like this movie. I had to sell it.
1,boring as hell. bunch of incest scenes, masterbation, gang rape scenes..
1,Boooooooo
1,I'm not sure why anyone thought it would be a good idea to make this film. Jackie Chan and John Cusack should be ashamed of themselves.  The ridiculous plot could be overlooked if there were any redeeming qualities to the film.  Terrible editing, boring fight scenes, just bad all around.  Jackie makes an effort in the fight scenes, but he's slowing down in his older years.  There are plenty of warnings in the bad reviews this movie has received; read them.  Don't waste your money buying or renting this.
1,To be fair, this film received one extra "guy" star for the young stars -- cute girls in skimpy outfits -- and the fairly accomplished acting. I did watch the whole thing through; so it did keep my attention.  But, and this is the problem, I have no idea what happened. The plot is so convoluted, with temporal shifts, dream(?) sequences, and repeated but altered actions, that I cannot fathom what the film is trying to tell me. And I'm a fairly bright guy. This is one of those films, well photographed to be sure, that needs a set of notes for the viewer, so he comprehends what he is viewing. Perhaps some kind soul would care to explain to me what I just watched. Then maybe watching it again with this new understanding will tempt me to increase the rating to three stars.
1,I purchased this DVD without properly reviewing the reviews.  None the less, the sound is terrible, lost at times.  The frames freeze up way too much.  The actual video footage is poor to very poor.  A waste of money and the first time I have ever been disappointed with the purchase of a DVD from Amazon.
1,This documentary is a major dud. The Everglades is my favorite National Park. I've been there hundreds of times and witnessed startling  beauty like nowhere else. This amateurish film misses all of that. From a park ranger who drones on and on from a memorized script to the lifeless,passionless narration -all worthless. For people wanting to visit the "glades for the first time-this will turn them away,For those with a lifetime love affair of the park,this will have then groaning. That many species are mis-identified is unforgivable. I noticed a whole series of National Park Docs that I planned to watch. I've deletrd all of them. Where is Richard Attenborough when you need him ?
1,Okay, I promised myself that I wouldn't expend too much energy in writing this review after having seen this film (for free, thankfully) on Showtime, but I probably will anyway, so here goes: DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR? is one of the least funny so-called 'comedies' that I have seen in the past few years.  It's not just that it's a stupid movie (after all, what else would one expect from a film titled DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR?), it's that it's just not funny. A famous reviewer once said that although there are bad horror films and bad dramas, there is no kind of film that is worse than a bad comedy.  I have to agree with this philosophy--and DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR? is a very painful example of it.	Since humor is basically a subjective concept in the first place, let me illustrate my reaction to this movie with a comparison: I laughed throughout every single scene of BLAZING SADDLES, MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL, AIRPLANE!, THE NAKED GUN: FROM THE FILES OF POLICE SQUAD!, and SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER & UNCUT. I laughed most of the time during AMERICAN PIE and SCARY MOVIE. I laughed occasionally while watching SLUMS OF BEVERLY HILLS and ACE VENTURA: PET DETECTIVE. I chuckled sporadically at THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY and DUMB AND DUMBER. I think I kind of snickered once or twice during one scene of DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR? You get the idea.	Anybody wanting to see this movie because of how funny Ashton Kutcher is as the terminally clueless stoner Michael Kelso in the very-funny TV hit "That '70's Show", please stop yourself right now.  Although Kutcher does play a fairly similar character in this movie, if you expect the dialogue to be as smart and funny as on his TV show, you're going to be very disappointed.  This is a flick that assumes that people will find words like "shibby", "dude" and "sweet" funny--especially when repeated over and over and *over* again.  Well I didn't, you sweet shibby dude. Oh, and I'm sorry but, no matter how many times the phrase "continuum transfunctioner" is spoken--at least 50 times in this movie, believe it or not--it just doesn't get funny, either. Oh well...DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR? is probably not the unfunniest comedy I've ever seen (that distinction would go out equally to the mega-bombs HEART CONDITION and THE CABLE GUY), but it's pretty well up there in the Top Ten!	P.S.: the word "shibby" never caught on as the new 'cool word' the way the director and screenwriter had obviously thought that it would. Thank God for small favors--eh, dude? :)
1,These two had good chemistry but very unfortunate writing and less plot. Too bad - could have been fun, especially without the few "God does it all" insertions which had nothing to do with anything else in the story.
1,With all the talent behind and in front of the camera..you would think that the Coen brothers did it again...well think again.  This is by far the worst Coen brothers movie.  Cloony hams it up over acting, as does Brad Pitt. Malcovich and Mcdormand are good..but there is nothing in the screenplay for them to be good at...this movie is not even a rental...I'd say if you have to watch it on network television when it comes on...the commercials will break the horrid monotony of this mess.
1,I deleted this movie because of its early use of what is to me a despicably foul word that is commonly used but which I nevertheless hate.
1,Please spare yourselves the agony that is this "movie".
1,This was kind of a dumb movie.  I love Sandra Bullock and have watched an untold number of her movies.  She should have passed on this one as she's a great actress and this movie was beneath her - very poor writing and the plot was ridiculous.  The movie was over rated in the media when it came out, perhaps because George Clooney is in the beginning and it is a Sandra Bullock movie.		If you don't want to be disappointed, take a pass.
1,Boring.  Extremely boring.  I was expecting something more enthralling and exciting -- it wasn't.  It may have expressed the history well; however, it was just too humdrum for me.
1,Terrible. Extremely profane. Hard to understand some characters. Can the veep and staff really be that dumb? Not worth your time.
1,Encase you didn't know, the Ultimate Warrior and Vince McMahon have been on bad terms for a number of years now. The WWE wanted Warrior to participate in this DVD, but they couldn't come to terms.		So typical WWE and Vince McMahon showing no integrity, they decided to bury him in the DVD. This DVD makes a mockery out of him, completely bashes him. Ultimate Warrior reiterates this statement and completely bashes McMahon on his website (most of which is blatantly honest criticism.)		If you're a true Ultimate Warrior fan, DO NOT buy this DVD and put more money in Vince McMahon's pockets. You'll be doing no justice to the good memories you have as a wrestling fan years ago.		Why would Warrior fans want to buy a DVD bashing him? Just another example of WWE profiting off of the stars of the past because their product today is absolutely horrible.
1,They have truely come a long way. But I guess I was expecting a little different story about them. It was kind of trailer trashy.
1,With all the bad acting & the way it was shot, Watching Blood Feast brung back memories of the videos/ movies we use to have to shoot in High School film class. It was like watching all those videos/ movies now & thinking they were so good back then. Now you look at them & think what the hell was I thinking. Blood Feast was 1 of those videos/ movies. It felt like it was made for some High School film project
1,This is *not* the movie that is currently in theaters, starring Emily Blunt. This is a shameless, opportunistic attempt to cash in on the popularity of the movie of the same title, but in no other way bears any resemblance or connection to the book or movie with which it shares a title. I stopped watching as soon as I realized I had been misled. What little I did see was not compelling enough for me to care to see anything further.
1,It's cool if you want to watch a couple good matches. No way Randy's best matches. I love Randy, but I was expecting so much more. And it only has a few matches....not the best :(
1,This was a very disappointing movie.  Barry Levinson's record on Baltimore-based movies has been excellent:  "Avalon" and "Diner" are films to be seen over and over.  "...And Justice  for All" [as co-writer, not director] is a memorable black comedy.  And "Tin Men" is OK.  "Liberty Heights" just does not  come together; it's all over the place.  The segments featuring Ben Foster  as the younger son almost work, thanks to the actor.  Joe Mantegna shows  what a great professional actor can do with weak material.  Adrien Brody as  the older son spends much of the film [this is definitely a movie, not a  film] looking confused; probably more as the result of not receiving help  from the director as to what his segments are all about.  The confusion and  the stereotyping in these segments [about the supposed lifestyles of  wealthy English-Americans] are embarrassing.  Even more distressing are the  scenes involving a black drug dealer.  This is one of those cases where one  wishes a talented filmmaker had a good friend who could look at the filmed  bits and ask, "Are you sure you want to do this?"  With this kind  of semi-autobiographical movie, one is tempted to cut the director some  slack because of the overlap between hazy nostalgia and an ostensibly  accurate depiction of past events. However, in this case the result is not  worth the ambiguity.  This is the kind of movie people want to like.  It is  supposed to be personal and it is dealing with socially important issues.  Fine.  But, it has to be evaluated as a MOVIE and, as such, it fails.
1,No me gusta. Es una mala representacin de Bolivia. No tiene sentido.	I did not like this movie at all. It has a bad image for Bolivia. It was not written well, had no real theme or point. It is full of stereotypes.
1,This is a movie made for stupid people to watch so that they can feel like they've seen something smart.  The fact is that this is one of the dumbest films I've ever seen.  This is Besson's worst film despite high production values and a good cast.  What a waste.
1,This was pretty bad.  The acting was terrible.  Story was terrible.  But the very worst thing in this movie was the continuous annoying PIANO MUSIC!
1,I doubt if too many people laid awake at night in fear after watching this movie. The special effects really sucked, but the movie was good.(GOOD, NOT REALLY GOOD OR GREAT). There could have been abit more romance betwen the two main characters. Also one of the two should have been in greater jeopardy at the end. This threat mixed with romance would have made the movie better. I would actually give the movie a 2.75 score. The two dimwits got on my nerves. One of the many comical moments was the prfessor turning around in digust and telling them to shut up. It would not have taken much to have made this a better movie, but apparently someone ran out of money.		This is a movie that should be viewed just for fun. In that vane, it is well worth the ten bucks for the dvd. I say do it over again. Only this time, get a loan.
1,This is complete rubbish. Does not qualify as a movie. Maybe a bad college experiment for a young director. Anyone with half a brain and attention to details will be in physical pain watching this train wreck.
1,DUMB!
1,Pointless, soulless black and white (think In Cold Blood or opening of Wizard of Oz - only Nebraska's turn instead of Kansas).	A reality TV approach to a look at a mid-western family. Cold, cynical, and with stereotyping to the max.	This is to film making what reality TV is to entertainment.
1,Lucio Fulci's best known movie opens with a seemingly abandoned sailboat that nearly collides with other boats along the coast of New York City.  The Harbour Patrol board the boat, to find it a mess and abandoned.  Well, nearly.  One of them is attacked by a monster and killed.	The boat's identified as belonging to the father of Ann, who went to the Antilles for some research and from whom she hasn't heard of in three months.  She teams up with Peter West, a British reporter living in NYC who dissatisfied with the police's version of the story, finds a letter from Ann's father, who had contracted some strange disease on the island of Matoul.	The two get there with the help of Susan and Bryan, a couple on holiday.  However, Dr. Maynard, in charge of the hospital, has problems on his hands to the point that he wraps his patients in sheets, ties them down, then shoots them in the head as they rise up.  When he welcomes the quartet, the zombies have already started attacking, even killing the doctor's wife in a scene where her eyes gets pierced by an attacking zombie.  That unfortunate victim is played by Olga Karlatos, known for playing Prince's mother in Purple Rain.	Following the movie are movie and TV trailers, and a few radio spots for the movie, which aren't much to scream about.  However, one of the movie ads boasted the distribution of barf bags to the audience.  Amusing.	While achieving the shock level of flesh-eating zombies, blood gushing out from jugular veins, and heads squirting out blood when shot, there aren't many outstanding or appealing characters.  Plus there's no credible or scientific explanation, other than voodoo rituals, of what caused the zombies to start popping out of the ground, which by the way is one of the neat effects in the movie.  The grotesque look of the zombies and the siege on the church is best enhanced on a big screen.  Worth a look once in a while, but highly overrated.  Watch the original Night Of The Living Dead instead.
1,Amityville Haunting is another basic found-footage horror film.  A new family moves into the house and begin experiencing supernatural events; the events are capture by Luke, the son, and home security cameras. The acting ranges from terrible to mediocre; the scenes where Luke talks to himself are very bad and sound incredibly forced. There are only a few good scares, while most scares fell flat for me. The ending was simply okay. It claims to be real footage, but it obviously isn't. It really doesn't impress or try anything new at all, you've seen this movie before.		By the way, there is some nudity and sex at the beginning of the film and only a little blood. Save your money, I caught it on Netflix Streaming (available as of 6/21/12) and definitely wouldn't recommend paying for it.
1,A few weeks ago in my review for "Wrong Turn 4" I mentioned how horror fans are willing to watch just about anything. They live and die in the horror genre. "Sure "Wrong Turn 3" sucked but 4 has to be at least a little bit better...right?" It doesn't matter how many awful sequels we get, we are more than willing to watch another one. The same is true for direct-to-dvd horror. Mostly just franchises the studios realize they can no longer make money at the cinemas with, they cut the budget, release it on dvd, and watch the profits come in.		Case in point, today's entry in the direct-to-dvd horror sequel lottery, "Hostel: Part III." I will confess that I was not the biggest fan of the original "Hostel." I found the characters to be obnoxiously shallow and its 45 minutes of nudity mixed with 45 minutes of gore just didn't sit well with me. Nonetheless, I was pleasantly surprised by just how good "Hostel: Part II" was. It took all of the mistakes about the first one (unlikable characters, no villain backstory, too much nudity) and turned out to be a delicious black comedy with a perfect ending. Now, we have "Hostel: Part III." Does it live up to the expectations set by the second entry or does it die trying like the original?		"Hostel: Part III" begins with a fake out that is actually pretty ingenious. A young man is brought back to a hotel room by a slutty blond stripper and her beefy, bald boyfriend. One thing leads to another and two of them end up drugged and taken away. To say which two would ruin the surprise. Next, we have a group of four friends attending a bachelor party in Las Vegas. These characters are the typical beer guzzling, horny jocks that have become standard place in most horror movies and comedies today. Seriously it is that hard to write likable characters? I guess so. Okay, not off to a good start and we are only fifteen minutes into the movie. The overgrown frat boys are enticed by two sexy escorts to join them at a private party off the Strip. Because, as we all now, whatever happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Once there, they are horrified to find themselves the subjects of a perverse game of torture, where members of the Elite Hunting Club are hosting the most sadistic show in town.		Blah, blah, blah. "Hostel: Part III" brings nothing new to the torture table besides a few half-hearted twists and some lame deaths. What is the point in watching a "Hostel" film if nearly ALL of the deaths occur off screen? Not only that, but the few deaths that we actually do get to see are ruined by awful CGI. Note to filmmakers, CGI is easier and cheaper but note that easier and cheaper doesn't always mean better. The final twist in the last five minutes is just insulting. Think of it as a maggot on the top of a rancid ice cream sundae. Skip it.
1,It was slow and disjointed.  Didn't finish it.
1,This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  I thought about stopping it  half way through but I kept thinking it might have a saving grace.  IT DID NOT!
1,This film has such a boring, and long beginning, that I just turned it off after 20 minutes or so.
1,Movie starts off great, by the middle of the film you think "this movie is fantastic", however the ending is so lame it spoilt the whole movie for me.....	Not as lame as Aliens dying of a computer virus, but still very lame never the less.
1,The hinge-point of this whole film is when Bud Fox's father verbally abuses him and embarrasses him in front of his friends and business associates. Carl, the father, calls Bud's girlfriend a whore. He uses appeal to emotion after appeal to emotion to overlook the fact that Bluestar was massively unprofitable and needed restructuring immediately. He humiliates his son by mocking the several summers Bud worked for Bluestar. He torpedoes the very deal that will save the company and return it to profitability, choosing his "company men" (union workers) over the son he's abandoned repeatedly for decades (including providing him with "economic outpatient care"- i.e. enabling his son with loans that allow the son to enter into Wall Street in the first place).	Without Carl Fox's backing of the restructuring of Bluestar, Gordon Gecko chooses instead to liquidate the company. Since Bud Fox has a head full of emotional abuse he's just endured from his pathetic, weak father, he sides with his father and attacks Gordon Gecko in his office. "Reality" supposedly sets in after this and Bud Fox is able to have a "clean conscience" as the result of turning state's evidence against Gordon Gecko. Bud, just like his own father did to him, abandons the only father that nurtured him out of a genuine self-interest (which is true love). Under Gordon Gecko's tutelage, all of Bud's dreams come true and wealth is actually created in the market. By buckling under his father's abuse and returning to being a "good boy" for his father, Bud throws everything away and uses the State against Gordon Gecko for what is in truth wealth creation. Bud becomes his biological father and will be a loser and a leech for the rest of his life, especially because he will be going to prison.		The filmmaker clearly wants you to think that Gordon Gecko was a conniving snake the whole time and was just going to liquidate the company, regardless of what was achieved in a restructuring deal but I just don't buy it. The film was super solid up until this hinge point and then it just became a full-blown propaganda piece. Not a surprise to me that the character we're supposed sympathize with, the rootsy Carl Fox, is an emotional and verbal abuser with communistic tendencies. The screenwriters for the film are both NYC-born hard leftists with Jewish backgrounds that have turned to highly dissociative Buddhist practices in old-age. It wouldn't be a stretch of the imagination to say that their fathers, particularly Oliver Stone's, were abusive in much the same way that Carl Fox is in this film. Oliver Stone's father was an investment broker who ran his own father's securities firm into the ground. The firm was ultimately ended up in the hands of American Express.		This film engendered in a very big way the attitude of "too big to fail" (through emotional appeals to the "workers at Bluestar keeping their jobs"). This same attitude put $700 billion dollars of Federal Reserve currency into the hands of failed banks in 2008.		Businesses MUST fail, by the laws of nature and of free market economics. Verbal abuse from a father to a son is NEVER okay, even if done under the guise of "principles". What is so often decried as "greed" and "the profit motive" by leftists is actually man's inherent and natural inclination to create wealth and value in the market place. Bud is finally becoming independent of his father's poisonous pedagogy when one final dose of vitriolic abuse reels him back in. The brainwashing is complete.		It takes a certain kind of hardiness and pain tolerance to liquidate companies when they are no longer profitable nor have been for some time, particularly when restructuring plans fall through because of emotionally abusive leftists. This hardiness is portrayed to the viewers, and awkwardly so, as a kind of evil to be opposed. This is flat out wrong and this film is, in and of itself, abusive through manipulation.	To accept a life in the free market, where all human value is created, we must accept the hardiness of emotional pain tolerance and we must break from the poisonous doctrines of our collectivist parents. We must be willing to cut out the cancers when they are killing us (Bluestar was no doubt financed through deficit).	Remember, it was Gordon Gecko who was fully transparent in asking the employees to take a pay cut and work harder so that they may have a profit sharing program (take a look at Costco or Les Schwab, the employees LOVE their profit sharing). It was Carl Fox who was the verbal and emotional abuser with communist sympathies. It was Bud Fox who stabbed Gordon Gecko in the back, derailing all of Gordon's effort to remain out of the clutches of the State.	Despite his flaws, like being unfaithful to his wife (a depiction I find unrealistic given how sweet Gecko is to his wife and son) or having a cigarette addiction, make no mistake: Gecko is a valuable and important part of a free society. Bud Fox ruined his own life by subsidizing his father's romanticizing but ultimately anachronistic and unlearning lifestyle. Bud Fox ruined Darien's life by punishing her for her loyalty. Bud Fox ruined Gecko's life by snitching on him to a government that always wants a dishonest cut. Bud Fox took Gordon Gecko away from his family.	Oliver Stone sold out by making this film, just like Bud Fox sold out by screwing over Gordon Gecko (cringefully depicted as the "Devil" in this film). With this film, Oliver Stone stabbed in the back the very industry, finance, that made New York City great. Wall Street has never been the same. Oliver Stone, through his parental alter-ego Bud Fox, became the devil in 1986. He failed to grieve his father's failure as an investment broker and instead used his tremendous artistic talent to delude millions of people.	Oliver Stone will never be brought to justice for his collusion in the brainwashing of an entire generation. He will die a wealthy Buddhist in a gated community, rich from the money a now-decimated middle class gave to him.
1,just not for me still okay
1,Not my bag.
1,What happened to the ending?  You can't decide so you just leave it off?  That's such a coward's way.	If it had a bad or good ending I would have at least given it a 3 or even 4, but it had no ending.
1,I bought this movie before reading the reviews.  Big mistake.  I heard it was so good, and Meryl Streep always is, but not in this kind of film.  I watched for the first 20 minutes, maybe less, and came to the computer to read the reviews.  Was it me?  At first I couldn't figure out what was going on, but after a short while I realized they were doing re-runs of her life through a woman aging with dementia.  My mother suffered from Alzheimer's and I didn't want to watch it all over again.  It's a horror.  I will not watch the rest of this film. After reading the reviews, I realized that many other reviews were not good, and though it's Meryl Streep, and she's a great actress, it didn't help. I've recently purchased two DVD's with her in it,Julie and Julia and The Devil Wears Prada, I loved them both. Watched them many times.  She's great in both. The films are uplifting and enjoyable.  We all have enough of our own problems to watch something as awful as this. I hated Doubt as well, but at least I could watch it.  I guess I'm not interested in horror films.  That was what this film seemed to be moving into. Well, that's all I have to write.  I will probably never watch the rest, but I don't think I'll be missing anything.  Why didn't they make a film about the high points of her life and career? That's what I thought it would be.  Who knows?  Good advice.  Read these reviews before you purchase any films.
1,I only watched this movie because I had my 9 yo nephew visiting and he wanted to watch it, so of course he wins.  He liked it but even at 9 thought it was silly.  So imagine what a 40yo adult thought of it.  Anyway, it was worth a couple of quick laughs and was bearable to get through it.  Good for kids I guess.  There was no quality, no depth, no reflection, nothing of anything good or bad to remember about it. Between this and Bart Mall Cop, Kevin James has fallen far from his King of Queens days.
1,This review has 2 stars because of the discs.  The series would get 3 stars.  It took a long time to get the discs to play.  Over and over again I got an "incorrect disc" message.  Eventually all the discs played but these are marketed as Region 1 and should play with no issues. As far as the series goes, this is the last New Tricks season as UCOS disbands in the final episode.  Jerry leaves early on after he is threatened by organized crime and moves to New York City. It's just as well the series is ending because the current crew is a shadow of the original cast although Danny and Steve are good.  Just not Jack or Brian.
1,I have seen more than my share of low-budget, independently-made gay-themed films;  and I am glad that there are so many of my fellow viewers who give so much support to the filmmakers who deliver such a wide array of products.  Yet, I feel that there is nothing to be gained by giving false praise when there is so little of merit to recommend a film such as this.  I tend to keep my expectations low and am therefore often very pleasantly surprised by those indie gems that come along.  This film is definitely not in that category.  It suffers from bad writing, bad directing, and some very bad acting.  VERY bad. And it reeks of sincerity. Nuff said.
1,This DVD is a terrible video transfer. I hope some time in the future this great movie gets the attention it really deserves - A DVD set with BOTH versions of the movie, some good extras, directors commentary, and a decent transfer. This is a very poor presentation for an extraordinary movie.
1,This was a fantasy film, as with most Daniel Day-Lewis films. However, at times I nearly had to turn off the sound because I found the music score was the worst I had ever heard. That would include ALL Ed Wood films and the music of The New World. Not sure what the music director was trying to accomplish, it did NOT work.
1,This movie is quite obviously intent on being a "serious "version of the Frankenstein story .It comes across as dull and earnest and is marred by an excessive pomposity in script and overall treatment .In striving to be weighty it merely comes over as dull and stilted	Baron  Charles Frankenstein (Sting)has already created his male creature (Clancy Brown)when the movie starts and he is looking to make a mate for him ( Jennifer Beals) .As she is brought to life the laboratory explodes and she is carried to safety by Frankenstein who wrongly assumes that the male has perished in the fire .Quite obviously the good Baron has improved his skills considerably between making the male creature and building the woma -he is the archetypal  Frankenstein monster while she is a stunner .He decides to keep her for himself and raise her as a sort of Pygmalion experiment -he will create an educated ,  independent ,free spirited "new woman" (rather like Mary Shelley the author of the source novel).He names her Eve -the first woman- and tells her that she is an amnesia victim he found wandering in the nearby woods .		The movie proceeds to cut between Eve and the male monster .He has escaped from the fire and is wandering the roads where he meets a dwarf (David Rappaport)and they strike up a friendship eventually joining a circus and becoming moderately successful and the monster assumes the name Viktor .Things go wrong when the dwarf is murdered and Viktor takes it upon himself to avenge his death and is forced to go on the run. The two creations gradually find their way to each other and even develop a telepathic link with one amother  and events move to a violent climax		I suspect this would like to think of itself as a message movie specifically a feminist movie. Eve does learn to think for herself and defies her creator but only to the extent of wanting another man -a dashing youung soldier rather than him. The other message is not notably profound either-Dont tamper with Nature .In short the standard horror movie schtick	The movie is badly acted .Sting resembles a block of wood in period garments and as for Ms Beals !Well -I did wonder about Frankenstein trying to animate her because no director has managed to do so in any of her movie roles so far. In the words of the Sex Pistols song "We're all pretty ,we're so pretty.we're all pretty vacant"The best scenes are those between Brown and Rappaport which are both funny and moving		The score by Maurice Jarre is excellent -lush and romantic -as is the art direction by Michael Seymour .In an way they sum up the movie -nice to look at but with more pretnsions than actual substance
1,I really shouldn't even bother to review this as I did not watch the entire show.  What I did watch was horrible.
1,Great for chicks. Not much of a story line. Try it out.
1,What the hell is wrong with all the people that gave this piece of cinematic retardation good reviews... It's like a bad student film. I'm forced to give it at least one star, but it deserves a negative five...
1,8 old movies no one would want to watch and I love old b/w movies. maybe one out of the group was ok
1,It sucked.  Bad acting, stories didn't make sense.  Horrible movie.
1,Demi Moore's tortured screams of "Noooo! Noooo!" at the end of this garbage heap of a film were very appropriate, since that is exactly what I was thinking after realizing I had wasted 90 minutes of my life on this incomprehensible nonsense.
1,While represented to be "The Complete Series"  that is a misrepresentation.		I was looking for Naked Gun, 33 1/3 The Final Insult but when I saw I could get what was represented to be The Complete Series I purchased that figuring re-watching some of the other films in the series would be enjoyable.  The Complete Series did not include Naked Gun, 33 1/3 The Final Insult so I ended up having to purchase Naked Gun, 33 1/3 The Final Insult elsewhere
1,Even for a mindless action movie, it was sh177y.  I often try to give things the benefit of the doubt, but there was nothing that I liked about this movie at all.  The worst part for me was the terrible camera work, which, I believe, was filmed by an epileptic in an electric chair.  I could easily give it another star or two if it had ONE single steady shot in the entire film, but it just didn't happen.  Watching the movie gave me a headache and made me want to have a seizure of my very own.		I'm usually pretty cool with bad acting/thin plots/excessive explosions/etc., but mounting a camera to the head of a wild pig with an espresso IV is no way (in my opinion) to shoot a movie theater quality movie.		If this had gone straight to video, I would write a much different review.  Since I paid good money to see this in a movie theater on a big screen, I feel pretty ripped off.		I wanted to go to Wal-Mart and Target with a roll of stickers that read "This movie sucks a$$" when the DVD was released.
1,didn,t watch it
1,I LOVE IT.
1,an absolute load of rubbish--  like Jason Stratham, can't see how he would lower his standards to do a movie like this-- must have needed the money
1,This series could have been done in 1 season as they waste so much time going over the same info over and over.  We still don't know whats there.
1,Just finished watching "Predestination" released by Stage 6 Films.	When "Predestination" was first released, it was hailed as an outstanding film adaptation of Robert A. Heinlein's classic time travel short story "All You Zombies" - which sadly I never read. I have read most of what is called Heinlein's classic juvenile science fiction novels and enjoyed them years ago - okay, many many years ago.	So I was intrigued by the idea of a modern attempt at a movie of a Heinlein story.  I should have just stayed intrigued and waited until this kerstinker of movie was in the $5 at the nearby Wal-Mart.	"Predestination" tells  a simple tale that is quite well known to movie viewers - a Temporal Agent is investigating and trying to prevent attacks in the past by the "Fizzle Bomber."  His last attempt ends in failure when he's not able to seal the breach in the bomb containment box in time and is badly burned.	Now since he has just about reached the limit of time jumps he can make before temporal psychosis overwhelms him, he must jump back in time to recruit his younger self into the  unnamed Temporal Agency - at least unnamed in this movie.	What follows next is one of the oddest and longest pick up conversations in a bar that I have ever had the unfortunate experience to witnesses both auditory and visually.	Make NO mistake, "Predestination" is that most dreadful of movies, a self-absorbed and pretentious science fiction art film.	How pretentious?  SPOILER ALERT:  You will hear the song, "I'm My Own Grandpa" several times throughout the movie; along with seeing full frontal nudity from a side angle and see that ultimate of all time travel paradoxes - a take on self-love; and I just know I'm going to get in trouble for this observation, but if David Gerrold got the idea for Star Trek's Tribbles from Heinlein's Martian fuzzy cats; then its easy to see how Gerrold got some of his ideas for "The Man Who Folded Himself."	NOT RECOMMENDED!	NO STARS!
1,While I'm on my kick of watching horrible b movies I thought about revisiting Grim, which I saw at a young age. I had remembered it being laughable then so assumed it could only be that much better years later. Once I popped it in all these memories started coming back to me as I spent the next hour and a half with my jaw dropped. Right off the bat I starting cracking up with the opening credits that looked like a very poorly executed powerpoint presentation . Somehow things only got worse and worse leading me to one of the worst films I've ever seen, AGAIN!		After the extremely long powerpoint opening we start off with a group of terrible actors messing with an ouija board. There is no explanation to why they are all together nor does it matter. They somehow resurrect the Grim, who looks like a giant rubber mess. Now we take a shift to a group of spelunkers who are investigating a poorly made cave beneath a small town. Again no explanation to why. As they search the cave they become prey to Grim who chases them around in a hilarious fashion. He can also teleport through walls to sneak up on you with some of the funniest special effects ever created. It's simply amazing! I can't even explain what it looks like, I can only say that it's worth watching the film just to see these effects for yourself.		To sum it up Grim is easily one of the worst I have seen, and that is saying a lot. It's just amazing that while working on set the actors didn't just walk off realizing how terrible this would be. However I don't want to rip it apart too much because I did get a lot of laughs out of it. Lets face it, if you are watching Grim you aren't expecting too much just by looking at the cover. If you happen to be in the market for some poorly made b horror laughs then Grim is your vehicle.
1,Shrek 2 is definatly not the #1 comedy of all time. I never laughed during the whole movie and I think Barney is funnier than this piece of crap. Dont buy it because it says the #1 comedy of all time. It is the #1 worst movie of all time. In the movie all shrek wants to do is become a person. It was like a movie for 4 year olds.
1,The target audience for this Michael Apted directed sleeper, best I can tell, are probably any reluctant conservatives out there who are in the market for the experience of, for just once, being on the side of something right and just. "Look honey, not only are they against slavery, but they are for free education! I'm lovin' this being a liberal thing." As I've stated before, anybody can beat up on a conquered issue but it takes one brave soul to go after a pressing issue of the day. We need more movies like "Road to Guantanamo" and fewer movies like this. And there really is no mistaking who this film is aimed at. It is a throwback to the early 90's art house, when they were filled almost exclusively with little old ladies and proper entertainment like this. So as we wait around to see if slavery is actually abolished we get to watch rich white people enjoying their mansions. Our hero William Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd) flirts with a girl two times just so that they can justify throwing a wedding up on screen. We get death bed scenes that spew the virtue of faith. And we get a happy ending that is happy because it results in procreation. Yeehaw!		I pick on my dad a lot because he refuses to see costume dramas ("Take and adventure" I say) but he does have a point, these things always tend to be stale. At the center of the story is William, who we learn led the charge in England to do away with the grand tradition of forced labor. It is a whitewash as Williams appears as saintly as can be which means that he is not a character but an ideal. He builds a coalition, collects signatures, and battles a very neutered opposition led by Ciaran Hinds and Toby Jones (or Julius Caesar and Truman Capote if you prefer). There is no drama because we know how history turns out, and since the characters are either bad or good we can't turn to them for excitement either. There is some sly humor mixed in, but unfortunately most of the jokes were duds (although I'm sure the gag where he pops out of the slave box killed with those aforementioned little old ladies). So there I was, stuck watching a movie that had no interest in doing anything so as not to offend anybody.		I do find it disheartening that this film did so much better at the box office than Apted's last film "49 Up" ($19 million to $240,000) because that one was so much more intelligent than this one. Of course viewing habits in this country are disgraceful and the people only seem interested in showing up if you pander to them. In the middle of the film William tricks a bunch of stuffy pro-slave types into listening to his speech by promising them one thing and then delivering another. This gave me hope that, maybe possibly, Apted would pull a similar trick and deliver an unforeseen shot to the audience. But no such luck. On the plus side it does take a loving look at a true act of bravery in the campaign for equal rights for all. And Ciaran Hinds is always a welcome face. Still, those who are unseasoned in the art of sitting quietly through something of this type should stay home because it is exactly what the preview makes it out to be. I have no doubt that Apted's intentions were pure when he sat down to make "Amazing Grace" I just feel that somewhere along the way it turned into one big back patting session for Americans everywhere. **1/4
1,Watched 10 min bored to death
1,"How can we update the old haunted house/demonic possession/gory death/gotta get out of here storyline and convince people to buy tickets?"  "I know - let's make the house a spaceship and the  usual paranormal whacko ripe for possession is the guy that built the  spaceship" "Cool - let's do it and if we title it Event Horizon,  we can label it science fiction"	Very poor reworking of the standard  horror movie involving haunting/possession with a near criminal  mis-labeling as science fiction.  The only saving grace is the special  effects...
1,The only good thing about the film is the amazing quality of acting done by Ms. Theron. She quite deservedly won an Oscar for her role. However, the rest of the film stinks. This is a sympathetic portrait of a merciless serial killer. We are made to feel sorry for a woman who, in cold blood, murdered several men.
1,I'm all for real life and realistic stories but this was a depressing film without a satisfactory resolution. I am not referring to a happy ending, but more in the sense of a satisfactory ending that covers all things brought up in the story.
1,2 stars is almost two too many for this lame SCI-FI.  The special effects are the only reason I gave it a 2.  The acting is pitiful in this movie.  The screaming, possesed, Marilyn Manson look-a-like, was stupid and annoying.  Why couldn't the leader of the Ghost be more of an organized type of leader sending his troops out to fight in a more rational strategy against the human invaders?  Of course the human soldiers, cops, whatever, were idiots too.  I just thought this movie was not thought out well, AT ALL!...
1,I only watched it because my flight was 12 hours long and I already watched all the other movies	on my other flights.	what a cheesy story, what a stupid plot, I like chick flicks from time to time, but this was sooo bad.	The boyfriend (Owen) following the girl - taken directly from "Only you", and all the other tricks taken from other, better movies.	The characters were one-dimensional, the movie felt almost like a cartoon.	The girls were pretty, and costumes and sets glamorous, but this is no reason to spend almost 2 hours watching garbage of a movie.
1,I had been looking for a captioned dvd of this movie for years, I decided to get the single movie and hoped that it was captioned, instead I recieved the double movie disc with Colors, which Wal-Mart sells and is not captioned. They repackaged the double movie set with this listed cover. 1 star
1,This stupid miles from tomorrow land should be cancelled because the theme song from miles from tomorrow land which I find it annoying because it says miles miles from tomorrow land which is really stupid and annoying because miles from tomorrow land should get cancelled by Disney junior bring back house of mouse
1,I usually love Liam films but Dont waste your time on this one. The plot is terrible. bad character development.
1,Which sucks, really, that less than good has become the average for this series.		TV and comics spoilers to follow.		Yet again, I watch this show for one reason only: zombies. Here they make an appearance, but it's late in the first half, and then it's a weak attempt. I guess a stupid creature might just start gnawing at the first available limb, boot or no, but  wouldn't it naturally try different areas until it hit flesh? This one is wrestling with Daryl's boot enough to wake him before he beats it down (awesomely, side note).		After the end of the last episode I was so psyched to see Merle in action again. But then it's just a hallucination. And a two-handed one at that. That's just weak. And why wouldn't an experienced woodsman who is seriously wounded simply travel downstream instead of attempting--twice--to scale a dangerous cliff?		I get that Andrea needs a set-up to make her the wicked sniper she is in the comics. But in this particular case I can't imagine ANYONE, new to guns or not, thinking they're so cool they can shoot BETWEEN their own guys in order to take out a walker. She hit Daryl in the head as Rick and company were talking to him. So they were standing between her and the target. She shot through them, knowing a gun shot is a dinner bell, and seeing them already surround the problem. Someone needs to take that rifle and pistol whip her with it.		Herschel is upset about a missing horse? His family is keeping a horde of trouble in the barn not three hundred yards from where people are camped! And he doesn't share this? Of course people will go exploring, who wouldn't? Speaking of, wouldn't you secure some spikes in the ground surrounding your tent, or hang bells or something as an early warning system? It's not like the farm is heavily defended. Or really at all, as Andrea wasn't assigned sniper position, she just went up there on her own.		Sadly, this somewhat follows the comics. I think the difference is in comics you can imagine away anything missing from the story between the panels to justify actions. With TV you're seeing real people in these situations and you can't help but think, no wait, nobody is that dumb...		Again, sad that this series has established itself as sub par. Maybe it's a good thing that Darabont left. He certainly isn't going out on a high note.
1,Poor attempt at Jason Borne meets Dexter meets Manchuarian Candidate.  Who the hell is Tiziano Cella?  Did you (director) rate this movie a billion times at 5 star ratings to get people to watch it?  I'm sure you did.  Please don't quit your day job, there's no story behind this crappy ass film.  Viewer beware, look elsewhere!
1,Love Neve Campbell, adore James Franco and am absolutely obsessed with ballet, but still did not like this movie.  It was slow, dull, self-indulgent and missed the mark in portraying what young dancers go through to succeed:  angst, self-doubt, determination, tears - all suffered to reach joy and triumph.  The dancing is gorgeous and Campbell did not disappoint.  But the story lacks a soul.
1,This movie played well 20 years ago when short guys were the fashion and any action movie was all the rage. Too Hip, Gotta go.
1,Well that's 30 minutes of my life I'll never get back. I don't care that with my 'Prime' account it was free, my time is more valuable than this horrible remake. People have commented that they like it because it explains his childhood from the original, where he went bad, (A) that's not enough to make a movie worth watching, and (B) in the original his childhood doesn't matter, the kid/murderer/psycho was simply born with no soul, which by the way makes him even spookier. Trying to relate this to the original doesn't even make any sense as in the original Michael wasn't born into a white trash, low class family with mom stripping and a pole dancer and his dad wasn't a lazy, non-working, alcoholic child abuser. The original Halloween was a classic, they should never try to remake a classic, especially if they're going to go so low budget. I said that this took 30 minutes of my time, well that's actually not true, I fell asleep pretty shortly after it started. That should tell you something. Not to mention how dark all of the scenes are, that put a decent strain on my eyes. This is nothing like the original, just a bunch of gore so if that's what you're into then go ahead and watch it. Me? I prefer to actually be scared when watching a 'scary' movie, not bored to tears. I cannot in any good faith recommend this movie. Stick to the original. Whoever made this version should be ashamed!
1,First of all, why have 1,000 composers write the songs?  Second of all, the plot is way too modern for a musical.  Third of all, they should've only sung when they were performing for someone, like in Camp, Fame, and Cabaret (modern movie-musicals that I love, by the way) and not just break into song out of nowhere.  I think that Disney has just killed the movie-musical entirely.  And I am very saddened by that fact.		Plus, all of the girls are very horrible at lip-synching!
1,This film had everything going for it. It had a gutsy,bang up director, a hunky leading man, an academy award winning actress,a great big budget and all the magic available to filmakers today. It also had the story of one of the most fascinating men in history pre-written for it. So,how did it end up being a three hour dud?		The acting has a lot to do with it. Ferrell just doesn't have the power and charisma to pull off Alexander the Great. His "stirring" speeches to his troops aren't all that stirring. Mel Gibson (Braveheart) he ain't. I wouldn't follow this guy to the state line, let alone to the ends of the Earth. Stone replaces good acting with drawn out shots of Ferrell's face or soulfull dark eyes. It doesn't work. Ferrell may not deserve all the blame, he didn't have all that great a script to work with.		Angelina Jolie could have phoned this one in.		she is down right laughable as Alexander's mom, Olympias. Her acting is limited to squinting and hissing her lines. She really had no clue where to go with this part. There is no evidence of any real affection for her son. Her accent( what I would call ancient Vampira) is awful. Has the woman ever actually heard a Greek accent?		Jared Leto as Hepaistion is vapid at best. Lets leave it at that.		I was never able to really connect with any character. You simply do not give a darn what happens to these people. That may well be the films greatest weakness. The depth of the relationship with Hephaistion is never truly explored. The -were they or were they not- aside, an incredible bond of friendship existed between these two men. Historical sources tell us that after Hephaistion's death, Alexander locked himself away and mourned without food and water for many days. He began to decline, and never recovered. This film does not show that kind of passionate devotion. This was probably the single most important relationship in Alexander's life, and Stone's film glosses over it.		The film does have a few good points. The cinematography and costuming are wonderful. The battle scenes are big and gory, as warfare in that time most surely was. There is a good feel for time and place. Sadly,though, you simply do not ever get any sense of what made Alexander great.
1,Fell asleep multiple times while watching.  Performances are fine but the plot is confusing and the pace is sssssllllllloooooowwwwww.  The twist is neither interesting nor surprising.  Skip it.
1,if everyone liked this,what movie did i stumble into????this was ''alright'' up until the ridiculous ending.nowadays,especially with sequals,prequals,1/2 way through it seems like the director is on autopilot.it had its moments,some good ideas/effects.but compared to the first movie,it COMPLETELY LACKED EVERYTHING.THE CHEMISRTY WAS NON EXISTANT.THE ADDED CHARACTORS WERE BUFFOONS.why do i always get suckered into dishing out $$$$$$ to sequals i know thats gonna rot?my only hope is the matrix.only the ghost of ED WOOD could muck that up.
1,Just really terrible.  Poor effects, shallow plot, bad acting, luke warm action, not really much good, except the general idea.  "Automata" moved at a snails pace and both myself and my girlfriend had a hard time staying away to watch the whole thing.  Towards the end we just wanted it to be over.		The general idea is very interesting, a kind of take of on Asimov's "I,Robot" world, with a bit of end of the world disaster apocalypse tossed in.  They should have been able to make a good or even watchable movie out of that, but there was not a real plot, very superficial characters, a world that did not really make sense.		They even had a sexbot with boobs and butt attachment .... it was ridiculous.  It was a cool idea that the robots themselves somehow found or evolved the ability to redesign themselves, that really did not much enter into the movie or the plot.  Too bad.  Skip it, or wait until you can find it somewhere to watch for free.		Of if you really need to get to sleep ... turn this on and I guarantee it will take less than 10 minutes.
1,I remember this movie looking really cool on dvd. This was terrible on Blu ray. It actually made me laugh seeing how bad the effects were. Not a bad movie just terrible on Blu ray.
1,Poor premise, poor screen play, poor acting in most cases and just plain bad.  A big waste of time and really poor entertainment.
1,Feast (John Gulager, 2005)		Feast is one of those movies that has almost endless promise. It starts off great, introducing the characters in such a way that you can be sure the movie's going to start flaunting monster-movie convention right and left. And it does! The rules of monster movies go flying out the window... for the first thirty minutes. After that, however, things go downhill.		The plot, and a very straightforward one it is: a number of people are trapped in a bar by a number of hungry creatures, and have to fight their way out. With such a simple premise, one can do almost anything. And at the beginning of Feast, it seems as if John Gulager's going to try to do almost anything. Once we're past the point of introducing the characters (which is done in amusing videogame style-- Uwe Boll could learn a lot from John Gulager's approach), though, convention comes sticking its head right back in. Pretty soon, we're riding the same predictable rails we've seen in a thousand monster movies. A great deal of potential here, with very little of it realized. **
1,Sad to say, but this movie was a waste of all the talent that was in it.
1,The DVD played as anticipated. However, the content was lousy.
1,verrrrrrry  boring
1,I REALLY didn't like this movie! It was about 30 minutes too long for what it had to offer. And besides it's special effects and talented cast that isn't much. I not only dislike it for the fact that it is boring, but it is not historically accurate which has hurt some other recent films like The Patriot and Perfect Storm. For better submarine films, check out The Hunt for Red October or Crimson Tide. For U-571, wait for cable or just skip it altogher. Not worth the time.
1,A comedy?	More a farce; I guess that is a form of comedy.	DO NOT waste your time.
1,Okay so I caught a bunch of It Takes a Thief on a basic cable channel and it reminded me how much I  didn't like it them. They're nowhere near golden age of TV quality and are a poor man's Mission Impossible. Don't spend your money on this crap-tape it off your cable tv. It probably is just as lame in HDTV. Definitely don't spend your reverse mortgage money to buy this!!!!! Usa Network's WHITE COLLAR is a flashier depiction of this genre--semi reformed crook helps cops catch crooks....Count the toupees while watchung this clunker,,,,,,
1,The movie preview seemed interesting, unfortunately the plot was like watching one of those silly horror movies. You know what the characters should do, but they do the opposite just to keep the story dragging on way too long.
1,In spite of the fact that it's a good value, I'd skip this pack. Instead, if you don't already have it, get&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Horror-Classics-50-Movie-Pack-Collection/dp/B0001HAGTM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Horror Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection</a>. That gives you only 50 horror films, but it is the A-list of B horror films. There is no duplication between the 50 Movie Horror Pack and this 100 Movie Pack of horror films, although there is some duplication between this pack and the Chilling Classics, Tales of Terror and Nightmare Worlds packs. In fact, most of the best films in this pack are in the Tales of Terror pack.		Primarily, though, Mill Creek found these hundred films by going more to the 60's, 70's, and 80's, rather than the 30's through the 50's, and the quality of the content suffers for it. Especially by the 1970's, most B horror films are far inferior in quality to those made up to the 1950's. This is also the decade when horror films began to exchange graphic violence for atmosphere and campiness, and that simply doesn't appeal to an old movie fan like myself. The breakdown of films by decade is:		1920's - 1	1930's - 18	1940's - 11	1950's - 19	1960's - 20	1970's - 22	1980's - 9		The highlights of the package are the following:	The Amazing Transparent Man (1960) - combines safe-cracking and an invisibility formula with a criminal main character who seems to think he is John Wayne.	The Bat (1926) - a silent horror film that has a character dressed like Batman trying to scare away inhabitants of an old house so he can have the 200K hidden there to himself.	House of Mystery (1934) - a man kills a monkey in India and a curse follows him home twenty years later. Another of the "old dark house" thrillers plus there's a man in a monkey suit that is not particularly scary.	Eegah (1962) and another Arch Hall Jr. movie - Anything with Arch Hall was always fun to me. He'll always be the king of camp.	The Wasp Woman (1960) - 40 year old cosmetic queen longs to be 22 again. A cosmetic potion does the trick, but she literally becomes Queen Bee.	Strangers of the Evening (1932) - Eugene Pallette & Zasu Pitts in a mystery involving bodies disappearing from the city morgue.	Shock (1946) - Vincent Price is caught in the act of killing his wife and must do away with the only witness, who is in shock.	Midnight Warning (1932) - A man seems to disappear in thin air in front of several witnesses. A detective must determine what really happened. Good precode mystery.	One Frightened Night (1935) - A wealthy old man decides to divide his estate among a group of people UNLESS his long lost granddaughter returns. Of course she does just that. Mix that with a night of creepy events in the old man's mansion with the heirs all there as guests, and you have a good old-fashioned thriller.	The Ghost Walks (1934) - Everyone staying in an old dark house who says that they see ghosts winds up dead. This mystery must be solved!		That's about it for the best films in the set. If you think it is worth the price, go for it.
1,"Twist Around the Clock" (1961) was hurriedly made to capitalize on the new dance craze, the Twist. Columbia was in such a hurry to cash in that producer Sam Katzman simply took the script of the 1956 smash hit "Rock Around the Clock" and refilmed it almost verbatim. Most of the storyline and many entire dialogue sequences are lifted bodily from the older film. If you know "Rock Around the Clock," you'll find yourself reciting "Twist Around the Clock."		"Twist Around the Clock" is pretty low-voltage, despite guest-star turns by Dion (who lip-synchs "Runaround Sue," "The Wanderer," and "The Majestic"), The Marcels (not shown to best advantage with a mediocre rendition of "Merry Twist-mas"), Vicki Spencer (a Connie Francis wanna-be), and top-billed Twistmaster Chubby Checker. Chubby only has a few lines of dialogue but he is quite ingratiating in his limited role; his fans will be disappointed that he doesn't show up until the middle of the movie, and he doesn't sing his record hits "The Twist" or "Let's Twist Again." The plotline is handled by uninspired unknowns; John Cronin and Mary Mitchell do not distinguish themselves as the romantic leads, although Alvy Moore of "Green Acres" gets a chuckle or two in a deadpan comedy-relief role.		If you have to choose between the "Twist Around the Clock" and "Rock Around the Clock" DVDs, "Rock Around the Clock" is easily your better bet. "Twist Around the Clock" fares badly on all counts: the music is monotonous (not one of the "twist" numbers is memorable), the story portions between numbers are leaden, and the predictability of the whole enterprise will have you reaching for the fast-forward button. All this has going for it is an archaeological value: curious viewers can observe the Twist phenomenon in its original context, and film buffs can see for themselves just how much was stolen from an older and better movie.
1,What a waste of my time. Worst thing ever. Did anyone like it who wasn't a friend of the folks involved? Yucky! Please remove these images from my memory. Ugh.
1,Who ever wrote this movie clearly doesn't know the first thing about time travel. I suggest watching every episode of Star Trek to help them understand the subject. Great FX but that enough isn't enough to save this colossal failure.
1,I should have asked for a refund on this lame show. The acting was second rate for the top rated performers. It appeared to be a film made to give them something to do.
1,The movie never downloaded even after waiting an hour. It just kept saying " still downloading.
1,After all of the hype & much expectation, I was really hoping this would land on my list of favorites.  Unfortunately it was slow and boring.  I rented it twice on my Kindle because I fell asleep the first time during the first 30 minutes.  SLOW!  I rented it a second time, thinking I'd give it just one more chance.... same thing.  I got through it, but only because I felt obligated at that point because I'd dropped almost $10 in rental fees.  Now I can see why it didn't get much attention at the Oscars.
1,Ugh
1,Just bad...
1,Are the 5 star reviews from the cast?		A parody?	A satire?		(shrug) If you say so.
1,I always wonder what movies the Amazon reviewers have watched in their lives that would make them give something like this a four or five star rating. It's just a bunch of forgettable songs strung together on a really flimsy story. There is one memorable song--"Hurray for Hollywood"--but the main singer in the number is so freakily strange you want to turn away or close your eyes. The one bit of plot that might have been developed interestingly was using the waitress as a double for a famous star, but that story line fizzles out early on. Busby Berkeley directed, so why didn't he include any of his fabulous over-the-top production numbers?	Still, I always try to find at least one little thing that's worth seeing or remembering, and in this disaster it has to be Louella Parsons, who looks and talks just like Edith Massey. She's the egg lady in an earlier incarnation! I especially like her scene in the Orchid Room when she's wearing a formal and jewels that are truly worthy of a John Waters wardrobe choice.	But really, people, don't bother.
1,Following a thorough review of my experience watching The Black Dahlia, I have concluded that the reason this film doesn't work is: It Made Me Want To Pick My Nose More. (And secondly, it is all Mood.)..There is nothing more to be paid.
1,Tilda Swinton, what were you thinking?  Telling this dreadful story is not a bad thing, but the small details should be believable, or why do I care? I'm amazed that there is always money in her purse to buy beer, drinks, etc. that is part of the challenge of this addiction, yet it just magically appears.
1,What was billed as a children's fantasy was actually a bloody and horribly sadistic tale of Fascist Black Shirts torturing and murdering resistance fighters.		Only 20% of the film takes place in the girl's fantasy.		A more truthful cover for the dvd would be of a bound guy having his hand snipped apart with a pair of cable cutters.		Incredibly depressing film.  Skip it and drink the potassium cyanide instead.
1,I saw some of this on Net Flix and could not watch very much of it.	Honest opinion? If this was the last movie on earth I would toss my TV out the window!
1,"Supertanker" (also known as "Super Tanker" or "Battle Tanker") is one of SyFy's very worst movies, and that's saying something. I watched this first over a year ago but was so disgusted with it I'm just finally able to contemplate reviewing it now. This is a film that knows nothing about the military, though repeatedly makes the point the military consists of nothing but bad guys, and even has a completely insulting subplot about the Medal of Honor that justifies a one star review by itself.		The film starts with a terrible premise and nonsensical science, and couples it with a ridiculous script, inept direction, bad sets and effects, and painful acting to result in something that I actually had a hard time finishing. (Given the movies I have seen, that is also saying something.) Seriously, "Bermuda Tentacles" is orders of magnitude better than this. Colonel Hanley (Atanas Srebrev) is the bad guy in chief, while Adam (Callum Blue) is the sensitive brainy hero who left magnetic containment science because it was being used by the evil military to make weapons. The obligatory romance is especially saccharine, and is between Adam and Morgan (Jon Mack...yes, that's not a typo, it is a woman's name in this case), and you just know that they are bound to be torn asunder by a ridiculous dramatic conclusion. (You'd be right.)		Anyway, they decide to put this Cold War relic doomsday weapon (ICE-10) made from a meteor on a supertanker and sink it in the Marianas Trench, which will save all humanity. It's an unusual tanker, what with its bulk cargo hatches and self-unloading boom, but never mind; it's the most credible part of the movie (certainly better than the airplane related special effects). The ship's Captain Spyrou is played by SyFy and B-movie regular Velizar Binev, and he's the best actor in the ensemble; contrast him with the Press Secretary (Sarah Brown) who turns in easily the worst performance here, and you'll see what I mean.		Through an epic sea voyage, the supertanker manages to make a giant antimatter cloud that's drifting towards Honolulu, and a team of magnetic containment specialists are called in, though they are for some reason disproportionately intimidated by Colonel Hanley (who is trying to be the bargain bin Steven Seagal here). As if there isn't enough going on we are introduced to a comic relief Asian specialist named Jackie (Jacky Woo) and the running joke ("What'd he say?") about his accent wears out its welcome nearly instantly. After a nearly unbearable White House press conference and hilarious airliner scene (I didn't think anything could top the awfulness of the C-17 scene at the opening of the film) we get a lot of science babble about how the ship is venting "death clouds" whenever they do whatever it is that they're doing. Finally the former CIA agent Robert Jordan (Ben Cross) spills the beans about the death clouds in a scene that will confirm Sarah Brown as a dreadful actress, certainly the worst in this movie. You simply will not believe the level of technobabble that ensues, as they reveal the plan is to sink the ship with the ICE-10 by filling it with concrete. No, reallyI know, I know, they are surrounded by water, which is a more effective and much easier method of scuttling a ship, but that wouldn't allow for cast members to get trapped by concrete below decks and to die heroically. Of course Adam and the Colonel have an unlikely meeting of the minds as we get this message: "I have been authorized to implement secondary protocol!" Oh, whatever.  There is much drama: shootings, frantic typing to manually control magnetic fluxes, and the aforementioned Medal of Honor plotpoint that made me physically cringe. "There's a small matter of a tactical nuke headed towards us!" is another point loudly made that would normally make an audience sit up and take notice, but here only serves to further distract and make viewers look at their watches to see how much longer this is. I recommend you pay it no heed.		Despite a lot of melodrama (How many times can Morgan call Adam "baby"? I lost count.) and constant warnings about the extreme instability of the ICE-10 they elect to sink the ship by setting off explosive charges on its deck; there's also a highly probably helicopter versus missile encounter that you must see to believe. Amid ponderous dialogue like "We're sitting on a million Hiroshimas here!" and some of the worst editing I have ever seen in any movie ever (watch for the cemetery), the film resolves as you knew it would if minus a couple of the cast members that started with us what seems about two weeks ago, but was only really 83 minutes earlier. The DVD wraps up with a very poor behind the scenes feature (in the infinitesimal chance you'd want to see more) and a photo gallery.		Velizar Binev carries the cast here, but there's not much he can do to save the movie no matter how hard he tries: this is a nonsensical, boring, pretentious, ponderous, and almost unbearable excuse for a movie, and is truly one of SyFy's worst ever.
1,Words cannot describe my disappointment! Rented the movie on Amazon video through my Playstation, and wish I could get my $4.99 back! Turned the movie off after 20 minutes of trying to get in the groove, but I just couldn't have my intellect insulted any further with a pot smoking toy with potty mouth and manners worse than any Bostonian I've ever met! I thought Wahlberg had stepped up his game, but was mistaken.
1,This could've been better in the right hands. As it was, the primary twist was given away far too early; the other one didn't matter, because nothing was done to make it relevant. Most of the actors did poorly, but the "family" scenes with the rookie FBI agent were painfully unbelievable and disgusting (the actress playing his wife contributed significantly to this, to be blunt). The supporting actor was ridiculously unfit for the role...especially given the final twist. It's not really possible for someone like that to be allowed to develop like this -- a weak, "modern" American "nerd." Even without active external factors, I doubt it would be psychologically possible. Not to mention the influence of the type of parents who raised him. Whoever wrote this bilge was culturally, historically, and ideologically clueless. And Cassius...and the whole "weak spot." Even a superficial gander at Russian/Commie culture would immediately reveal the principal Russian spies in this movie to be psychological impossibilities. For that matter, any clear-eyed look at American culture of the Cold War era -- or even just pre-2000 -- would expose the treacly garbage demanding to be taken seriously in this movie. The cold-blooded murder (of the senator) that kicked off the present-day events of the story is massively psychologically unrealistic as well.
1,Wasn't that good not what I was expecting
1,Boring, scripted, unappealing characters, way too predictable.  Main marlboro man character carried a lever action rifle through the whole movie, rarely used it, and it did absolutely nothing when he did use it.
1,Assassination Games, 2011 film		Two women enter the Samovar Club after being scanned for weapons. The Boss is down! Men run after the killer, but he gets away. They show scenes of this foreign country. Brazil enters his apartment and goes into his secret room. Elsewhere three men talk about a loose end. They plan to remove this problem. One stranger visits a small town, he tells about Polo. A man visits a store to collect his pay and learn about a new job offer. There is a flashback to an earlier assault. The man remembers it and decides to take the job. Another man waits with a rifle. A van drives by, an arrow hits the wrong man. Another man fires with his rifle but misses! Another failed attempt. Brazil saves a young woman. [Is this bait for a trap?]		A man invades a guarded estate, then finds a rival. They make a deal. Flint meets the armorer and negotiates for information. There is a surprise! Polo has a picture of his hunter. The Boss is threatened in his own home! Polo seeks information and gets a surprise! They are looking for Flint too. Is the price right? People choose their death when they choose their life. Polo questions a captive to get information. Then a deal is made. City Hall at 9 am is the rendezvous. But a neighbor talks to Polo! Be careful is always good advice. But things go wrong, very wrong. Where is Flint? Flint is tortured to make tell where the money is. But these bad guys get a surprise! More bodies fall, and Flint is rescued. The line was cut. Theres another body.		Flint gets a call on his video phone, a threat. They surrender. Can twelve million buy a life? The fight starts, then the shooting. Please forgive me! yells Polo. Is it too late? Is it over? No, more bodies fall. Now the revenge is complete. Can Flints wife be cured? Its expensive. A man visits a church. Will he change?		Although the language is English the settings and story show a foreign European style. It is an action film about revenge among criminals. This is a simple story complicated by corruption among officials. Was it based on true events of Interpol corruption? There is little news about European activities in the local newspapers nowadays. I found it hard to follow, as if parts were omitted for broadcast TV. What was the source of these criminals funds? Was their official tolerance?
1,Why is the second season released in full screen? The European version of Season One was released in the 16:9 wide version. Will there also be a release of the wide version of Season Two? Because I won't buy full screen. Full screen is the most idiotic idea: chop off both sides of the picture to make it fit on older TVs - less worth for your money.
1,The story of King Kong is so simple that a 7-minute miniepisode of The Simpsons tells as much story as Peter Jackson's 3-hour movie.  But we all know the story anyway - Jackson's challenge is to bring modern filmmaking techniques to the story and to give us something we've never seen before.  Certainly, his recreation of 1930's NYC is impressive, and his Kong is amazing.  Unfortunately, that is where my praise for the film ends (except to mention Jack Black's performance, which was a treat to watch).		There are a lot of details that I could go into as to why I consider Jackson's film to be failure.  None of these would be fatal on their own, and in fact most would be quickly forgiven in an engaging film.  But therein lies the problem - this film is not engaging.  In fact, it's somewhat dull.  This is not the director that brought out such wonderful and subtle performances in the LotR trilogy but rather the director of B-level horror films like Braindead.  There is simply too much action over too long a time, and the brain tunes out.  The story is made to showcase the abilities of the special effects, rather than the effects serving the needs of the story.		Even then the effects are not the best I've seen.  How this film won an Oscar when Star Wars III wasn't even nominated is offensive!  As I mentioned, Kong himself is very impressive, but nothing else in the film matches that achievement.  This would not be a problem if the filmakers were aiming for a stylised cartoon-like vision.  But Kong's realism serves to highlight the inadequacies of the rest of the film.  Most damaging are the scenes on the water (see: Master and Commander for how a boat should look at sea!), the dinosaurs (that are no better than Spielberg's in Jurassic Park, now 12 years old!), and the actors' performances (who look like they are staring off into space rather than looking at something).		But basically it all comes down to the fact that there is too little story and no reason to tell it.  The scenes on Skull Island seem endless, and endlessly similar, as we see dinosaurs attacking the ship's crew, then fighting Kong, then fighting Kong some more, then attacking Ann Darrow, then fighting Kong, then.... but you get the idea.  Oddly, the first hour (setting up the expedition) was widely derided by the critics, but is really the only part of the film worth watching.		This DVD edition is actually quite nice, with the expected full-spread of extras.  The extras might even be better than those on the LotR special editions - certainly they are tighter and more eye-catching for the casual viewer.  The film looks and (especially) sounds great.  Too bad there is no real reason to own the film.  Or even to see it.
1,This is quite a good film (overshadowed by Disney's "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" being released sooner in the theaters), and it certainly doesn't deserve obscurity.  However, this Alpha Video edition is NOT the one to get as the print used is terrible in its scratches and faded color.		I'd suggest ordering the WinStar 60th Anniversary edition which has this charming animated feature restored in gorgeous color, and with many extra features (like Gabby cartoons) making that a really worthwhile purchase.  But avoid this Alpha Video version.
1,Not sure if it is the weird choice of venue (none), or that the guy is just not funny.  Perhaps a bit of both.
1,Would have been very interesting except I could only watch the first episode.  Seems Amazon indicated it was free with prime, but not the second and succeeding ones.  I now check that before starting a pilot.  A true bait and switch tactic.
1,Bad and stupid movie I ever seen !
1,Some of you may reasonably assume that you can't go wrong with a movie that only costs 99 cents. Well, you are wrong. Ryan Reynolds, as always, is pretty bad as an actor. However, the script and the plot don't help him at all. The film has to many cliches like a cell phone that works, but then doesn't work at the just the right moments, people that put him on hold, etc. For some reason, he is equipped with a lighter, a pen, an empty wallet, and a cell phone. I hear that he has other things in the coffin with him, but I couldn't watch anymore of the film. Most of us would realize that there is a limited supply of air in a coffin, but Reynolds keeps lighting the lighter to make phone calls. The cell phone provides its own light, so why use a lighter every time you make a call? This is one of the many puzzling things that I noticed during the short time that I watched. Also, I can understand that any person would panic if they found themselves locked in a coffin and buried in Iraq of all places, but some things really don't make sense. As a military contractor, he doesn't realize that the U.S. government won't pay ransoms for captured personnel. Also, he seems to want to antagonize everyone he calls to get help. On one call someone asks him for his social security number. He gets angry and starts asking why they want it instead of simply giving it to the person. I mean, how else are they going to be able to identify you as the appropriate person (he lost the security number that was given to him by the contract company). I don't know about you, but if I was given an emergency number to use in case something happened while working in Iraq during a war, I would make sure I memorized it, tattooed it on my skin, and do whatever else I could to make sure it is available in case something happened. In the end, .99 cents is way too much to pay for this movie. I would have been a lot more upset if I paid full price at the movies theatre, but it is just .99. I could have gotten something from the .99 menu at my local fast food joint. A chocolate Frosty feel kind of good right now.
1,My wife and I wanted to like Arthur Christmas, but the movie lacked the heart that all great Christmas movies have. None of the Santas were likable, in fact they were downright selfish. It could be hard to explain to a child why 3 of the Santas didn't care about missing one child at Christmas.		The jokes aren't funny, the voice acting is so-so, and the story is a bit ridiculous. Pass on this one and watch "It's A Wonderful Life" for the umpteenth time instead.
1,Did. Not.  Like.  ,,it
1,After sitting on Miramax's shelf for two years, "Waking Up In Reno" had a cup of coffee in selected theaters before hitting the video stores, and it's not hard to see why: Despite its star power - Billy Bob Thornton, Charlize Theron and Patrick Swayze - the movie is a meandering flotilla of throwaway sitcom lines and faux Oprah lessons.	Thornton is Lonnie Earl, an Arkansas car dealer, full of shiftiness and charm, with a sweet, repressed wife Darlene (Natasha Richardson - yes, that one) Married couple Candy (Theron) and Roy (Swayze) are the best friends. Lonnie Earl's the kind of man who plans vacations to Reno in January for the rates and a monster truck rally - with a stop at a steak-eating competition along the way - while Darlene suffers as an art. Candy and Roy don't seem well matched, but they are trying to have a baby; the trip to Reno is, in fact, a working vacation.	"Reno" makes no secret that Lonnie Earl and Candy sleep together - though their hearts aren't in it - and their infidelity figures heavily an hour into the movie, after the four have wandered all over the Southwest. Writers Brent Briscoe and Mark Fauser - Thornton buds - intend to poke fun at Southerners, but only Thornton, who's spent half his career on the bottom of double bills, squeezes out a half-dozen laughs - he's seen awful scripts before and he knows how to milk them. Candy is target for satire, but Theron, brimming with tears as usual, plays her dead straight. Richardson's performance is an absolute catastrophe and Swayze's just Swayze - staring blankly, stammering, flinching. I'd call it method if it hadn't become his performance of choice since "City of Joy."
1,This movie starts out very slowly but with great photography and a genuine creepy feeling.  But that is short lived.  I figured out the "twist" within 15 minutes of the show and halfway through the story it went from creepy with potential to repulsive and disgusting and mean spirited.  I had to fast forward through the last 20 minutes just to see how it ended, which of course was about as lame and empty as I expected.  If you like the feeling you get when you look at an open wound for too long, then you might enjoy this.  Frankly I'm sorry I wasted my time.
1,What a HORRIBLE, TOXIC, DYSFUNCTIONAL ENVIRONMENT for these girls ! It is evident that the food is awful, the staff unprofessional and vindictive. I would NEVER send a client, friend or family member to this MESS OF A PLACE !
1,this movie is awful!  I was just in shock that it was promoted so well as fun and great.  I kept wanting to just stop it.  If you like a bitchy old woman being beyond realistic mean, then this is for you.  But save your time and money.  It goes in the trash.
1,Like the other reviewers, I must agree that this is one of the worst films you can ever watch. It's timing release was bad, the story is more cheesy than a triple-cheese pizza, the inclusive add-ins of acting make no sense, and the circus stuff is even more ridiculous. I think the entire cast and crew were so high on cocaine and LSD that they completely justified it, include the hippie movement at the end of the film. Totally ludicrous.		This film also severely hurt the film career of Catherine Mry Stewart. She nearly bounced back after "Night of the Comet", but then "The Last Starfighter" shot her back down, mostly ending her film career. In all honesty, this is a movie to get high on, or to bang to. This film was exactly like Xanadu, musical and creative, but way too cheesy and timed all wrong. Yes, throw this into the Worst Films Ever bin with Blues Brothers 2000 and Poltergeist 2 & 3.
1,This is one of the worst movies I have seen. The volume goes from nearly whispers to loud yelling and screaming. Besides the obvious volume control, the actors were awful and the lines were worse. The camera keeps jumping from one person's view to the computer to another person's view and I would get lost at who we were viewing what scenes with. I couldn't bear to watch this for more than 20mins. Very very very bad movie.
1,A strange story about a paranoid with social problems.  It just goes to show that if you have enough money you can be accepted as normal.  What is most troubling is that this is supposedly a true story.
1,The "stuff" that passes for actual movies now a days is terrible. To be honest I give it 1.5 stars.
1,horrible, don't think he has the ability to create a good movie any more
1,A group of people band and form together to stay alive from huge mutated mosquitoes which if they kill you, you radiate radiation. They join forces in a farmhouse and board it up and get ready to face down these hilariously looking mosquitos. Must of had guys on the sides holding up those suckers on wires, I guess. It all rolls up to a final bug squatting showdown with a big bang or no wait, that was my head hitting the wall because I was trying to get my brain started. A big critter movie with people banning together in a home, just like Duane Jones and company did in the original Night OF The Living Dead although these people are running away from huge mosquitos. Among the group is Gunnar Hansen (Leatherface from the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre) who wields a, yes, you guessed it, a chainsaw and he revs it up slicing and dicing these blood humpers to kibbles and bits. Act people!
1,Not. Y type of movie.....some of the kids liked it
1,Not very good I wouldn't recommend to anyone.  Don't waste your money on this DVD, it'll disappoint you for sure
1,If you've seen the coming attractions for this 2012 film, you've seen ALL the funny (or vaguely funny) scenes in the film. There is nothing else except the interminable wait for something else to amuse, shock, or otherwise lift your spirits.		Unless you are very hard core Tim Burton or Johnny Depp fans, there is really nothing here for you. Even fans of the TV show will be disappointed.		While this certainly isn't the worst film ever made, when you look at the talent involved and the miserable product they give us, it's a real shame to see resources wasted in this manner.
1,There have been many comparisons between this movie and The Matrix, but the only similarity is the focus on ultrarelistic virtual reality, perhaps with a bit of "which is the real world" ambiguity thrown in. I've been a fan of David Cronenberg for years, but this movie just wasn't up to his considerable par. The themes are fascinating, and the storyline progesses nicely, but the entire feel of the movie left me a little bored. I didn't really care whether or not the characters were able to do what they had to do, even when that included Jude Law eating a double headed lizard, which should have been disgustingly interesting. I'll keep watching Cronenberg, and you may want to check this one out, but go into it with no expectations. You might enjoy it more that way.
1,Boring
1,I fell asleep(no joke).  Very slow pace.  Interesting moments.  Scarlette's phony accent was a no no.  Wanted to like this one.
1,This show was white men in black face? That's the way it looked to me, I couldn't bring myself to watch it.
1,This movie was terrible, you can harldy hear the actors (if you can call them actors)voices when they talk.  The sound, video, music were all awful.  I know two people who saw this movie and liked it.  I guess taste is in the "eye of the beholder".  Just awful.
1,Highly disappointed
1,Too silly for me
1,I think this movie should have been named the pursuit of money. I usually like Pacino and Walken. Some actors will take anything that comes their way. No pride in their art. Oh well, I had time to kill and this certainly did it.
1,didn't like it
1,This is really a ridiculous movie. It is worse than "The Origin of Fire" which was the only movie I ever walked out of a theater from- and being unfortunate to watch for 30 minutes. An Oscar nowadays does NOT mean a good movie. It is usually the opposite. This movie was incredibly boring. It was also pathetic as I expected more from such a cast. Thank God no one I know is like this. The people I know may have problems, but they are genuinely into helping others and leading a worthwhile existence. I am glad it just was not me who found this a waste of time. I gave up about 50 minutes into it. I fast forwarded it to get the general gist of the rest, and watched the end. It did not save the movie, but was far more enjoyable and meaningful that way. This was worthy of a (very) short story written by a high schooler with a bit of insight, but not able to pull it off, and having to resort to the current social mindset that trash is actually good. It would be "The Emperor's New Clothes" if written by a talented 5th grader. The moral is the same. It speaks a better commentary on what is wrong with our society that found this worthwhile, than any point this picture tried to make, and was poorly done. Not even worth watching for free.
1,Just not very good . .
1,The Jackie Chan Collection ("The Master is Back!!") has 5 discs but less movies. Discs one and four (Fantasy Mission Force and Fire Dragon)are basically hacked up versions of the Fantasy Mission Force I had previously seen. The Fantasy Mission Force in this set is pretty shabby and lacking some of the elements that made the original strange enough to be worthwhile. Fire Dragon, with even poorer dubbing , picture quality and butchered editing is incredibly bizarre.....even missing over half of the Jackie scenes. It is nonsensical to the point of absurdity.....which is worth watching if you have the time and a little "movie helper" to get through. I have not watched the other films as I own them on other dvds but I will have to check just to see if they may be other movies themselves.
1,After waiting how many years this was disappointing.  It was Finding Nemo redux
1,boring didn't keep me entertained only worth having on while cleaning the house for background noise or something wouldn't buy
1,I found this movie dull and two-dimensional.  The plot is about three women in three different time periods (only separated by about 40 years each), who are depressed.  The plot connects the people through a book by Virginia Woolf.  I am not sure what the point of view of the writer was.  There are several philosophical statements repeated.  It seems that the movie is about people not living the way they want to live.  It never seems to develop completely.  However, the acting is superb.  As a woman, I did not feel a connection to this movie.
1,So here's the deal: a priest friend of Dalgliesh invites him to visit him in his place near the Dorset coast.  The priest is connected to a stately home/rest/medical facility whose staff wear monk's robes, though they're not monks.  They may be murderers, arsonists, pornography readers, adulterers and drug dealers, but they're not monks.  Dalgliesh arrives to find his friend dead and soon other bodies begin to pile up.  Dalgliesh-on-holiday investigates, assessing the possible guilt of a relatively strong cast, including Pauline Collins and Art Malik.		Unfortunately, the resulting film/mini-series is quite disappointing.  I say this from the perspective of a viewer who has become accustomed to the quality of such shows as Morse, Inspector Lewis, Midsomer Murders, Frost, Pie in the Sky, The Last Detective and the incomparable Foyle's War.  The Black Tower is at least twice as long as it needs to be.  It is tediously talky; the acting is stilted and the production values poor.  In one scene we hear two of the characters talking.  They approach a house and the next shot is taken from the house's interior.  They are still outside, but since they are on the other side of the door and windows the volume of their voices is diminished and we can't hear them clearly.  In the final scene Dalgliesh runs to a phone to call the local constabulary, but the phone has been disconnected.  A few minutes later another character uses the phone and the cavalry arrive promptly.		Sound and continuity errors might be overlooked, but not when they affect major plot points.  Similarly, a certain amount of talkiness might be expected in an English mystery set in a hothouse environment with a collection of snarky characters, but much of the talk is dull and the acting which accompanies it is surprisingly amateurish.  Here, the actors sometimes perform as if they're on stage and need to indulge in exaggerated physical actions to hold the attention of the audience in the upper balcony, but film actors (as Michael Caine has taught us) act with their eyes (or should).  Here, there is additional awkwardness.  One of the characters has a bad leg and walks with a cane.  Sometimes he appears to be misshapen and in pain, sometimes he seems normal.		I don't want to spoil the story, but the crime turns on an action that involves a behavior that occurs only once a year and a criminal implement insufficient to accomplish anything beyond a relatively modest level of crime.  It is, in short, preposterous, particularly in light of the number of people who have been sacrificed to protect the criminal activity.		Rent this for a long evening's viewing when everything else is unavailable.
1,ok
1,This movie was very choppy, the lines sucked.  The accents were existent in ALL dialects.  The only things that were this movies saving graces were its sharp foul language, and the select scenes of Iceland.  Otherwise the king's realm was lacking.  It looked like he had 20 people to govern over, and the only building existing was his mead hall on the hill.  Yet they had beautiful clothing for the queen.  Where was all this made?		Sarah Polley was horrible.  No hint of an accent at all, and her lines were lacking enthusiasm as well as timing sometimes.  Her uppity attitude didn't seem to flow with the movie either.		Very interesting twist on how Grendel lost his arm, and even the beginning of the story. . .  The reason why Grendel is so angry and blood thirsty.  Also it had a lot more pagan flavor than I expected.  It was refreshing actually, but not that deep.		Very unbelievable, yet I watched it because of Gerard Butler, and Tony Curran.  But just because a few guys fro 300 and/or 13th Warrior were in this, obviously didn't make it a good movie.  Want a better Viking movie?  13th Warrior.  At least the story flowed better, the accents were adequate, and the characters lines were fitting.  I don't recommend it.
1,This movie definitely needed a laugh or two; it was deathly dull. Gillian Anderson's dialogue sounded as if she was reading from a book, and the rest of the characters weren't much better. We didn't particularly care what happened at the end; we just wanted the tedious affair to expire.  These period piece usually don't move very fast anyway, but this one made glaciers look like tornadoes in comparison.  The DVD picture quality was uneven; some shots were spectacular, while others (expecially those with Ms. Anderson) looked like they were shot through some sort of filter. I know this film was well received by most critics. I guess we just missed the point.
1,I love Jason Sudeikiss yummmmmm what a man.  So virile and witty. But other than that I hate white people.  Look me, up, I hate them.  So this movie is right up my ally.  The handsome black man makes me fantasize about his abilities, how it's superior to mine.  Overall I give the movie 1 star because while I dislike white people there were to many of them in this film.  Adolph Hitler would be proud but I'm not!  I only like jewish race and their not white!!  No offense bc I am white.  I wish I was jewish or a strong definate Black Man like Jesse James in this film!!  Stilll one star since theres to many whites.  I whish I didn't have to see or hear anything made by white people but this is a sstep in the right direction so I updated it and gave it 2 stars.
1,This is not only the worst horror movie I've ever seen, it's the worst movie I've ever seen, period.  This has to be the cheapest piece of crap I've ever had the displeasure of laying my eyes on.  And I dig movies about serial killers.  This one just sucks because it's possibly the lowest budget movie that's ever been filmed.  This movie literally looks like it was shot on a bad home video camera with cheap stock footage spliced in. The acting is beyond atrocious, and the script is something that could have come from the mind of a 3rd grader, to be generous.  DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!  UNBELIEVABLY AWFUL!!!
1,So in The Masseur we have yet another story about male prostitution in Asia. One would start to suspect, from watching this film and such others as&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Macho-Dancer/dp/B00005KCB7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Macho Dancer</a>or&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/No-Regrets-Standard-Edition-DVD/dp/B000NIQVVQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">No Regrets (Standard Edition) DVD</a>, that the majority of gay Asian work as escorts. But, unlike the far superior&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/No-Regrets-Standard-Edition-DVD/dp/B000NIQVVQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">No Regrets (Standard Edition) DVD</a>, The Masseur fails to incorporate a story arc beyond that of the character's journey.		Our young masseur deals with the same issues we have seen in countless gay films - a youth of questionable sexuality is forced into a life serviving older men because of financial needs. Love is not portrayed. Familial duty is. American audiences may have difficulty with this.		While the back and forth movement of what passes for plot is inventive at time and showcases the local culture, it also fails to make a statement about the life of these masseurs. Yes, we know it's rough to be poor and to whore out your bodies. But no one else in the film but the main character has any story, any characterization, any depth.		The happy ending, as narrated, is ridiculous and comes out of left field and is not at all believeable based on what we have just watched.		This is the director's debut work. While it has some promising vision, he really needs to take new directions, tell new stories rather than rehash work we are all familiar with.
1,not very historical in that the movie revolved around individuals more than events.
1,Proof that even multiple super stars can't make a sheep movie succeed.
1,Season 1 and Season 2 are  High Camp.  Too High and Too Camp.  Too many sex scenes, too many torture scenes, too many knife fights, too many poisonings, too many people spitting up blood.  At some point, intelligent viewers begin to want to know more about the socio-economic realities of seventeenth-century French life that made Versailles possible and the French Revolution inevitable.  Season 1 and Season 2 deliver only cloying sensationalism.  The costumes and sets are gorgeous, but the characters are cardboard cutouts and the plot is aimless.  I'll see Season 2 through to the bitter end, but I'm not optimistic it will teach me anything much about a dynasty whose progeny hold positions of influence in Europe to this very day.
1,It was dubbed English so we ended up not watching it through. Was very hard to follow the plot. There are enough English movies that we find no need to watch other language ones. So after this one, we now watch who stars in it and if it looks like foreigners we don't add it to our list in the first place.
1,Boring, boring, boring.
1,She's had a decent run thank to Larry David.  Her 'comedy' is based upon a lot of crass and divisive humor; of course all tethered to that filthy mouth. I am certainly no prude, but after a while one can easily surmise that the language provides caulking for the cracks in the level of talent. I was never a fan and for those of you on the fence about this woman, now is your chance to land on the side of the sane.  Utter garbage.
1,...this is the worst comic book movie I've ever seen. I don't know much about the comic book itself, but the movie was quite boring and lame actually. Batman, Spider Man, X-Men and Superman movies are far better. Well except for the exception of Batman and Robin which was terrible. Arnold SCHWARZENEGGER as Mr. Freeze?! WTF? Kind of like Ben Affleck as any comic book character. I enjoy him in Kevin Smith films and that's about it. Especially Chasing Amy (His best performance). His acting in Dare Devil was just kind of dull.		The action is not very exciting. The scene where he flips around slowly was copied off of Spider Man. This movie just didn't excite me very much. I couldn't get into it at all. For a comic book movie it didn't really have that great of special effects. The main villian (Played by Michael Clark Duncan, who is a pretty cool actor) wasn't evolved very well.		As a film it wasn't enjoyable at all. Maybe if I was a fan of the comics...
1,Weak....drug out story line war is war.....ugh
1,Just saw the dvd not bad.,but 1 sci fiction show with 3 under water shows don't make sense .suggest that you can put here comes tobor  with other science fiction shows better yet put the show with the movie Tobor the great!
1,Italian-American Danny Aiello gives		heartfelt performance, but those of		us who have done any research into		Jack Ruby, JFK, et, al know, he was		nowhere near like man portrayed in		here! And Aiello is about 6'2", 260		lbs., and the real Jakob Rubenstein		was about 5'8" and 185! Also, this		movie and publishers squib on back		cover make out like Oswald REALLY		DID kill JFK, which anybody knows		DIDN'T happen! Plus, there is no		such person as 'stripper' Candy		Kane! Movie made by Hollywood		Khazars to exonerate Zionist		and Masonic connection to JFK's		killing, with willing dupes play-		ing supporting roles. This Revis-		ionist Reviewer was not fooled!
1,It was dumb
1,As the Amazon sites expand their visitors are seen as an increasingly important. Mark Moskowitz, an independent filmmaker, sent an e-mail message to about 3,000 people this week asking them to review the DVD of his film "Stone Reader," which goes on sale soon.	"If you didn't see it but heard it was good, go ahead and post anyway, (what the heck)," Mr. Moskowitz told them. "It doesn't obligate you for anything, even the truth."	Not even the truth?  I beg to differ. . .
1,I am a Crawford fan, and also enjoy old B&W movies.  But this is just so boring to watch, and you wonder why they bothered going on location to Catalina Island - all you mostly see is the stage stuff anyway.  The film apparently got bad reviews when it was first released, and Crawford herself said if she could have re-done it, she would have as the overall film lacked spark -she also referred to her own acting as too over the top.  This is one of her worst films in my opinion, yet it was one of the first they released on DVD.  Why not release the good ones first - like Mildred Pierce?  What's wrong with movie companies? The quality of this DVD is also really bad despite my copy saying "Digitally remastered from the original print". It was so poor that it kept fading in and out.  For the collectors of oldies only.  Sorry the review could not be more positive, but  i don't want you wasting money on a bad product.
1,Silent Night, Deadly Night 1 and 2 were classics. Many may disagree with the second film being good but I think it's funny. Listen to the director's commentary on the dvd and you'll see why. That being said, I couldn't wait to view the rest of the series but Santa delivered a pile of coal instead. The picture quality is clear and crisp. The only extra's is trailers for other Lion Gates films and many of them were released long ago. The problem with this set is simple- these movies friggin SUCK! I couldn't get thru all of part 3 because the acting was so bad and it seemed censored because there is no gore at all, let alone action. I can understand buying this set to complete the series but don't buy them if you have not seen the first two movies. These are so really crappy films and I'd stay far away from them.
1,The acting is decent. The plot moves very slowly.  The main character, that the series is named for, is and will always be unknown. After 10 hours you will barely know what is going on. I'm being generous with 2 stars.
1,Ok but not very good
1,A new look at the origins of Spider-man, or so the summary of this movie claimed.		I felt the pacing of this movie to be slow, and it seemed to me that the storyline was borrowed from&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Spider-Man/dp/B000O19EWK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Spider-Man</a>&nbsp;with a few ideas borrowed from&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Spider-Man-2/dp/0345470540/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Spider-Man 2</a>.  The scene in the movie where Uncle Ben is murdered, I felt that was taken directly from the first Spider-man movie that Tobey Maguire did.  And the villian being misguided reminded me of Doc Ock in Spider-man 2.		My other big issue with the movie was that I am so used to Peter Parker's girlfriend is Mary Jane, but in the movie, they had her be a girl named Gwen.		While I can appreciate that the makers of the film were trying to do something new and fresh with the storyline, I just don't think it worked with this film.
1,not so great.  I rather stick to reading the books
1,so-so
1,Too weird for me.
1,Yes, even by the low standards of Lifetime's formulaic, crime dramas, this one is bad. Horrible Fatal Attraction rip-off (and there have been many of those) with no surprises, high school drama club-level acting and a terrible script. Don't let the title fool you--this is tame, TV-14 (I would have rated it PG) level stuff. In fact, it plays like one of those old, Afterschool Movies (don't have sex with your teacher, kids!) with just a bit of racy/violent stuff thrown in. Lifetime has made a few, somewhat-decent time-killers, but this is not one of them.
1,Getting old sucks, and I could not get past the first 15 minutes of this movie, as it rubbed it in.
1,I watched this because I love Clara Bow, and only she could make this movie watchable.		The plot of this movie was all over the place, difficult to follow, too long, dragged out, and boring.		The ending was abrupt.		The title did not fit the movie.		It would have been nice if this movie was restored and colorized.
1,There's a terrific movie waiting to be written about communal cults, but this isn't it.  The pacing is turgid, the dialogue is pedestrian, the lighting is annoyingly murky and all the actors seem to be on Thorazine.		As for all the praise for Elizabeth Olsen, I can only assume the enthusiasm is just carried over from her more famous, older twin sisters.  She's unattractive and chubby, with appalling posture.  And she simply cannot act.		Viewing this film was like watching a teenage girl sulk for two hours - which, now that I think about it - is exactly what the film was.
1,Junk movie. Those who produced this movie should be ashamed.
1,This copy is fuzzy in the playback. I ordered a different one and the playback was sharp and very clear
1,I am a physician and a soldier currently in Iraq on my third tour.  I have sent men home who were not left whole and I have sent men back in caskets.  Luckily, my experience has been far more of the former.  We have a greater than 90% save rate over here for the wounded.  (You should see "Baghdad ER", also on DVD from Amazon, for that story.)  I saw this trash while in Iraq and could not have been more offended.  I am over here risking my life for the free speech of those who dissent but I cannot stomach lies told over the bodies of soldiers who have proudly given all for their country.  The writers of this lie have obviously not spoken to any soldiers who have been over here.  The vast majority who are injured are very saddened that they are leaving their buddies and that they themselves are out of the fight.  Every soldier from my unit who has been injured felt this way.  I know, I see every one of them.  Many who have died left letters to be sent to their families stating that they believed in what we are doing here and that they were proud of their service.  This film is a lie and not even good horror or satire.	  Judged on its own merits as a film, it falls far short.  The script is atrocious.  The plot is beyond predictable.  The characters are as one dimensional as it gets.  I watched this episode as part of a boxed set purchased in-theater and never would have watched it if I had known the premise prior to popping the disc in my player.  This is precisely the point of my review.  If you don't want to see someone who has never been a soldier try to speak for soldiers who are more than capable of speaking for themselves then don't watch this.  If you think you will be seeing good horror or even good satire then you will be be sorely disappointed.	  Interestingly, a later reviewer makes comments regarding the political and racial make-up of the current military.  Based on his comments, it is obvious that he has neither donned a uniform nor been deployed into the line of fire in a combat zone.  He has certainly never been in the US military.  I have worn the uniform both as an enlisted soldier and as a commissioned officer.  The purported divide in political beliefs is not that wide.  As far as free speech goes, I support the right to free speech more than anyone else.  That being said, it is a lie for me to put words in someone else's mouth and state that I speak for him when, in fact, I do not.  If I said a crtain later reviewer uttered a racial slur and he did not, this is not protected free speech.  It is slander.  If I print that then it is libel.  For example, when Cindy Sheehan says she speaks for soldiers and expresses what they want to say but cannot, she is a liar.  Her views are overwhelmingly denounced by soldiers.  That said, I'm sure she loved this episode immensely.
1,Some of these reviewers speak of this drival as if it's art of some sort. It's not!!!! Hollywood Tom through and through. Media propaganda perpetuating the pro war mentality. I would imagine that most of the guys who liked this film also think W is tuff. So we have the usual pretense of depth or meaning sprinkled on top of yet another dark tribute to violence as some valid expression of human creativity...sick. Yes, so I watched it. Really though folks, when you get right down to it - a polished turdorama. Ooooh, style...ooooh Cruise....too cool, yep too cool....yuk!
1,It's always a bad sign when a movie adaptation includes the name of the original author -- it usually means that it has nothing to do with the original story.		So I had a feeling of dark foreboding before watching "Jules Verne's Mysterious Island," an alleged adaptation of Jules Verne's classic sci-fi/adventure novel. Technically it was made by the Hallmark Channel, but it's more the sort of fare that the Asylum churns out for the SyFy Chanel -- plotless and weak, horrendous special effects, and a couple of good actors clearly just there for the paycheck.		A bunch of escapees from a Confederate prison camp manage to escape in a conveniently-placed, unguarded hot-air balloon, and are quickly blown out to sea. When it crashes on a mysterious island (title check!), Captain Cyrus Smith (Kyle MacLachlan) is picked up and brought to the house of Captain Nemo (Patrick Stewart with a dishtowel on his head), an eccentric steampunk genius who wants the rest of the world kept at a distance.		While looking for food and water, Cyrus' companions quickly find that the island is overrun with giant, poorly-rendered CGI animals. But Cyrus immediately distrusts Nemo because of his obvious lies and his checkered past. And at the same time, a mysterious medallion that shows the location of "Isabella's Treasure" on the island have attracted Captain Bob Harvey (Vinnie Jones) -- which sounds like a folk singer's name -- and his crew of cutthroats.		"Jules Verne's Mysterious Island" could be forgiven for being a terrible adaptation of a Jules Verne novel, but it can't be forgiven for being a terrible movie. This entire trainwreck REEKS of casual ineptitude, and pretty much every part of it is embarrassingly halfhearted -- it genuinely feels like nobody cared, so they simply slapped together elements of Verne, "Treasure Island" and SyFy monster movies.		There isn't really a plot here -- people run around and things happen, but rarely with logical progression. Giant CGI animals (whose origins are never sufficiently explained) occasionally attack when things get too dull. The dialogue is too predictable and mediocre to even bother remembering, and there are a number of gaping plot holes that they never even try to address. It's hard to tell if laziness or lack of enthusiasm were responsible.		And the characters are as thin as paper, and can be summed up in two or three words -- Stalwart Hero, Generic Love Interest, Cowardly Confederate Soldier, Teen Girl, Faithful Manservant and so on. None of them develop beyond that, and it's a chore to even remember their names other than Nemo.		Most of the actors are either terrible or sleepwalking through their roles. Kyle McLachlan is particularly wooden, Gabrielle Anwar seems confused about where she is, and Vinnie Jones is just PAINFULLY bad, talking in a silly gravelly voice like a Monty Python parody of a pirate. Patrick Stewart is one of the few bright spots -- while he clearly doesn't care, he still gives a pretty decent depiction of Nemo. And you can spot the debut of Tom Mison (of "Sleepy Hollow") playing a smart, subtle young pirate who manages to make Jones look even worse, just because he's really good.		"Jules Verne's Mysterious Island" is too inept to be cheesy fun, too dull to be so-bad-it's-good. Aside from aficionados of Stewart and Mison, it's not worth seeing for anyone.
1,This was the most poorly made movie i think i have ever seen.... Well we got through about 13 min of the movie and then gave up. I think they had one camera for the entire filming so you only see one angle , as if the tapped the camera to a spot and left it in one view. Also the acting made me feel like I was watching a highschool theatre show. this movie gets a negative one star!
1,Great cast but horrible film, the plot was ridiculous. I can't believe Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig agreed to be in this POS.
1,These films are all about nurses who seduce their patients and have sex with them, but you don't see the real sex!  Roger Corman has edited out all the real sex and is trying to make money and not deliver the goods.  The films have been edited out and you can tell.  Very bad for the producers for when these films first came out, they included all the sex and it was acceptable then and now we are being short changed.  You better off finding people who have the original films on vhs and making copies from them.  The quality may not be so great but at least you will view the films in its entirety.
1,That was a very hard watch. I suppose the portrayal of Chapman was pretty well done if that's what you're after. As a viewing experience though, it dragged on a long time and felt very unsettling. There isn't really any redeeming quality. There are many things out there probably more worthy of your time.
1,Stupid, should be rated R. Not for children
1,we ended up throwing this in the trash because it had some sort of paper thing in the middle of the disc that should not have been there, and if you tried to take it off, it left a very sticky residue.
1,Huge Justice League/DC Comic Fan.  Have seen almost all iterations and movies.  This was terrible.  A rehash of a 1980s Challenge of the Superfriends (Legion of Doom) episode with the addition of two simpering kid "heros."  Pass it by, not with the $4.99.
1,I like Barbra Streisand, always have, yet "Guilt Trip" is not worth having her come out of retirement to waste her time. Actually, I cannot believe she did! I didn't like Seth Rogan in "Knocked Up" with lovely Kathryn Heigel and even less in this flop. He does not have good screen presence. Even less attractive men like Steve Buscemi can have great on-screen presence, but Mr. Rogan simply does not. Nor does he even vaguely resemble Streisand to pass as her son.		And I'm just beginning my objections to this celluloid mess, which could have been better with script tweaking, nah, script rewriting. Some scenes had me think, aha, a passibly good one, then it isn't. An example is the silly free meal if you eat a 50-ounce steak. No, not Rogan, it's Streisand. The little flirtation that developes in this scene just did not make sense in that context.		The only time I like Rogan occurs in the scene in which he finally, finally tells his mom to shut up! Streisand's character talks incessantly, INCESSANTLY! Even I was telling her to just shut it! Of course, her feelings are hurt. They always are when annoying people are finally told how annoying they are. It's this scene and all the preceding ones that make me curious why Streisand would take this role.		OK, bottom line: The movie is about a man who has invented a tremendous product but has a poor sales technique. He invites his mom to take a cross-country road trip with him as he tries to sell his product. She is unaware that he is a failure because she is yakking all the time, telling him how great he is, how successful, how wonderful, blah, blah. She knows he tired of her and went to college across country to get away from her and now only sees her once or twice a year. Thus, the raison d'etre for the road trip--guilt.		It's hard to read Rogan's face, except for ticks and twists and blips. He's not a convincing actor. And poor Streisand has had so much plastic surgery, her face is shrunken. She looks weird (although, I must add, she does not have a wrinkle on her face and she must be 70 at least!).		There are two nice scenes toward the end which could have saved the movie, but they are wasted. They just do not have the power to erase the bad taste the previous hour gives. It's like licking an ice cream cone then the ice cream falls out. It's a tease, then it's disappointing.		I wish I could give one good reason to see this movie, but, alas, I cannot.
1,THIS ITEM I HAD TO SENT BACK 3 TIMES WARNER BROS. WORKSHOP HAD BADLY MARKED UP DISCS ONE TIME MARKED UP DISCS BROKEN CASE THEN MARKED UP DISCS AGAIN WARNER BROS. WORKSHOP NEEDS TO GET THIER STUFF TOGETHER DEFECTIVE BURNING MACHINES I CONTACTED THE CORPRATE OFFICE HAD TO TAKE A CREDIT BACK  WAS NOT AMAZONS PROBLEM. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,It's just like kid's play. Both Robin and the sheriff had chances of finishing off each other but they did not.
1,This third edition of the Mummy is pushing a good idea too far.  Let us all hope that this puts an end to the series.
1,Wolverines in it. But not the one you watched. If this is your type of movie. 5 star it
1,worthless in just about every way. Two hours and forty-five minutes I could have spent hitting myself in the face with a hammer, wasted! The characters were clichd cardboard cut outs caricatures. The plot was just one long plodding along from shooting to shooting. This movie is nothing but a celebration of violence. The thin veneer of it being a righteous anger felt more like an excuse to substitute racial slurs for actual dialog. This simpleminded cartoon of a movie had me constantly wishing that it was going to pick up and make something of itself... but it never did.
1,Stupid stupid movie. Full of smut , immorality and crap. Can't believe I subjected myself to it.
1,I am always excited about a new zombie movie, so when my fiance brought this one in to watch of course I was game.		When we first put it in it was in German, but don't worry you can change it to English. It's sort of like a Japanese movie, their mouthing doesn't fit the words perfectly, but it didn't annoy me.		There are some pretty scary scenes in this movie. Does it live up to I Am Legend or The First Resident Evil? *Sorry if I am being biased, but those are my two favorite zombie movies* Certainly not. The production of this movie is not nearly the caliber of those two (obviously, haha) and it's a bit more of a funny zombie movie. Not Shaun of the Dead funny, but bad acting funny.		The main character Michael (Michael Fuith) is looking for his ex-girlfriend Gabby. You do not know that they are exes in the beginning because of how in love, almost obsessively, he is with her. Maybe it was just the voice that was dubbed in English, but it started to annoy me how many times he said "Gabby." (Would make a GREAT drinking game!)		The movie is short, very short at one hour, so it get's to the action right away... which isn't a bad thing. Of course the zombies (which are less than par special effect make up wise) do have a kryptonite, which is light... what I don't understand is that they do come out in sunlight, but they do not like bright flashes...		The end is romantic, but just not enough in my opinion. When it was over my fiance and I looked at each other and thought "that's it?" I was a bit disappointed for the price I paid. I would suggest only if you like corny zombie movies.
1,junk
1,What garbage.  Mark Wahlberg, you're better than this.  Take out the "F" word and there would be no dialogue at all.  Thank God I didn't pay full price to see it at the theater.
1,stupid story that was hard to follow and had no point. Great actors wasted. Had potential.
1,I am so ashamed of myself. I have a 3 digit IQ but still fell for the old film company writing there own propaganda as the first reviews and then publishing them as if they were the public who had watched the movie. This movie didn't cause even the slightest ripple in my nerves or mind. It didn't bother me, upset me or disturb me for months as they claimed. They actually wrote over and over in at least a dozen company reviews that I read that it is the most disturbing movie ever made. I went over all the reviews again and realized that they all sound the same, what a dummy I am. They all start out with, "well I'm not going to give away the plot or spoilers but this is seriously the most disturbing movie ever, still bothers me six months later. WHAT!!!! PLEASE!!!! They even made references to the movie," hostel "while trying to make one believe the torture scenes are bearable if you can handle the torture scenes in, ' Hostel ', which are very graphic. Well guess what THERE ARE NO ACTUAL TORTURE SCENES, JUST IMPLIED unless you consider being chained up and punched in the stomach 7 or 8 times torture. Unlike all the studio execs who wrote the propaganda,  I am going to tell you the plot . It's about a bunch of old geezers who have decided that they can't die unless they have proof of life after death so one old nut decides that  the best way to accomplish this is by kidnapping little children and torturing them until they see God and then the little tykes can tell the old geezers what heavens all about. Living Martyrs so to speak. It's nuts to know that to be martyred one has to be dead in the first place. The movie actually plays out like 2  separate short screenplays shoved together with some of the dumbest filler I have ever seen in a very transparent attempt to link what I consider 2 separate short stories into a complete movie  I have to admit that the first short,  that I could call, ' Lucia's revenge ', was very well done and very exciting to watch,  this is the only good part of the movie where one watching feels justified, it takes place 15 years after Lucia escaped from the clutches of her kidnappers. She tracks them down  and goes to their house with a shotgun, rings the doorbell and without hesitation blows away one by one every one in the house including blowing the heads off the children as they ate cereal mixed with a little bit of brain matter and she does it with the same sense of mercy that they showed her when she was 8 years old. The filler is absolutely unrealistic and just plain too stupid to believe. After Lucia blows the entire family  away and then takes her own life. Her friend instead of leaving right  away, she decided it's better to stay at some strangers house  with all the dead bodies for three or four days, just long enough for the old geezers to show up and capture her. This was so corny to me that it reminded me of the coed, ax murderer movies like one I just had the displeasure of watching were in one scene a coed is screaming running around the house with the axe murderer hot  on her trail, the coed turns a corner and starts screaming  louder because on the floor in front of her is the dead body of her friend, a dead friend who just happened to have a loaded 38 revolver in her cold dead hand . Now this is the part that reminds me of the filler used in, ' Martyr's' . The coed instead of picking up the loaded pistol and blowing away the axe murderer decides it's safer to start screaming even louder and takes off running around the house again. Come on guys you can do better than this. This is the kind of filler that the, Martyr's screenwriter thought was sufficient to tie one great short story with a lesser second short. Dumb, just dumb. But my guess is that all the 14 to 17 year olds are going to love this movie. Their is no deep or subtle spiritual meaning here as their reviews like you to believe, just a guy short on words and ideas when he wrote this screenplay.
1,Awful spoof of spaghetti westerns from Paul Bartel, director/ star of the cult black comedy EATING RAOUL.	At the beginning of the movie the narrator says "Those who lust in the dust, shall die in the dust". If only Divine had dropped dead in his/her first frame. If that isn't bad enough, not four minutes into the picture viewers are subjected to a Divine naked-butt shot. I thought I had a pretty strong stomach, being a fan of movies like BLOODSUCKING FREAKS and I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, but this was disturbing!	The plot- Divine has half a treasure map tattooed on that scary tuckus of hers/his. So she and Tab Hunter set out across the desert to find the other half of the map so Divine can fulfill his/her dream of becoming a singer when they locate the booty(bad choice of word). Will viewers be spared another gratuitous not-so divine rump flashing? Is this REALLY the comedy-western to end all comedy-westerns? Not just that- LUST IN THE DUST nearly killed westerns, period. Luckily seven years later along came UNFORGIVEN; which is how the makers of this picture should remain. The talents of Lainie Kazan, Henry Silva and Caesar Romero are wasted. Do yourself a favor and check out EATING RAOUL instead.
1,The attempt here was to creat "art" rather than entertainment, and in so doing failed at both.  Worthwhile for some very good acting, but little else.  If you like being depressed or feeling smart by saying you enjoy bleak, artsy films, this one's for you.
1,Another drug induced action movie that makes you wonder about the capacity of brain power that humans have and how much more powerful they could possibly be without the limitations most people have today after an experimental drug is released their bodies..  The movie was a little disappointing to me and I was left expecting more.  So much potential with a lousy ending.
1,It would not  play so I guess I'll have to make another purchase. Very disappointed.
1,This version tries to be more of a "thinking" movie than the last one but it doesn't work. Not terrible but not great.
1,Did not purchase
1,I cannot believe this movie is nominated for awards...  really?  It was terrible!  My husband and I watched it until the end continually hoping something endearing would change our minds.  Uh, nope.  I didn't give a crap about any of the characters since their personal development as well as the development of their relationships was so scant.  So much of the movie was unrealistic I don't know where to begin.  Anyway, I love reading reviews- so it's only fair that I give mine, too.  Sorry guys, but I wish I would have passed on this.
1,sad very very sad if there is a d movie then this was it.
1,The ONLY thing that was good in this film was the 'atmosphere.' The story was not suspenseful in the least. There is very little drama, no suspense and definitely nothing to even tie the events together. Some have described this movie as having 'subtle' suspense, but I wouldn't even go that far. This is one to avoid.
1,Kill Katie Malone was so disappointing,the only bright spot was looking at Steven Colletti whom is very attractive but his acting and demeanor is more suited for a PG movie at best,you can take the boy out of Laguna Beach but!	The effect's consisted of the actors throwing themselves on the ground and into walls as if a malevolent force was doing it..maybe a drop of blood and weak storyline.	I say skip it,If you think this is going to scare you or gross you out ,wrong,it will only bore you to death. I saw it for free on cable and still wanted my time back. For synopsis read the one given.
1,I'm sorry but I just can't help but laugh at this movie.  Okay, so I gave this two stars because that's all this movie is, which is junk, and it sometimes becomes tedious at times, which can make it a little hard to wade through in contrary to what other people are saying.  But I think it's saying something when this movie is cited to be one of the worst films of all times, and by god, I think it's up there.  And by god, I'll be damned if it isn't a damn good B-movie piece of garbage.		From start to finish, this movie is an absolutely joyride of stupid characters, terrible dialogue, utterly pointless and stupid $#% scenes and other things, logic holes bigger than Armageddon, an absolutely boring and inane story, and by far some of the WORST acting I've ever seen from Tommy Wiseau.  Nobody in this movie is even worth paying attention other than to laugh at, and really, these people are lamer than the D @ D playing nerds who avoid showers and spend their time in their basements all day.  Let me just say that when Tommy killed himself, I was crying with joy because I just hated the man (even though he provided some of the best laughter I've had in a while).  I wasn't sure if I wanted to laugh hysterically after what I saw, or cry after the terrible garbage I saw.		Tommy just can't write a single convincing dialogue scene, and it's so badly acted that it almost borders on surreal.  Sometimes I can't even tell if it's him talking as it sometimes even seems to be dubbed wrong!  This is one of the worst acting jobs I've ever seen, and most child actor scan school this guy any day of the weak.  Good grief, this guy makes Shaq look like John Travolta (seriously!  I'm being sincere here!), and makes John Travolta look like Peter O' Toole.  I'm pretty sure you've heard it all before, but this is my favorite scene of all time.		Johnny: Hi!	Clerk: Can I help you?	Johnny: Yeah, can I have a dozen red roses, please?	Clerk: Oh hi, Johnny, I didn't know it was you.	Johnny: That's me!  How much is it?	Clerk: It will be 18 dollars.	Johnny: Here you go, keep the change, hi doggie.	Clerk: You're my favorite customer.	Johnny: Thanks a lot. Bye.		That whole scene takes 19 seconds from when he's in and when he's out!!!! How in the right mind did the writer even convince himself this is natural? I used to think that talking in movies sometimes hit a little too close to home (as in, come on, does a movie have to have people talking about mundane things? I can do that in life?).  Watching this makes me appreciate John Cassavetes eons more than I already have before, and this incredibly laughable and unrealistic dialogue is probably one of the most surreal scenes I've ever seen in a movie, eve more so that it doesn't include shadow figures, doppelgangers, Lynchian visuals, Cronerberg wackiness, and Jodoroswky images.		I won't say much else, but rest assured, by god, have a tissue box handy.  You'll need it.  Enjoy, and remember one thing: It's only a movie!  Wait a second....
1,I love old movies but this one was horrible.
1,It was a thorough disappointment.  Many of the movies included were not combat movies.  Many of the movies were from off the wall producers who I didn't think were good.  This is not a good deal.
1,a complete waste of time.... unless you are  in high school and have no life.
1,This movie had a good idea but poor execution. The movie starts slow and really doesn't build any momentum. The acting is subpar and the story doesn't make alot of sense. The characters acted like no normal person would. I wasted my money buying a movie I would't watch on tv. Avoid at all cost.
1,Hard to watch him after Matt D's version.  No interesting plot, nothing new.  Seemed like they tried to repackage same story, except they some how blew it and managed to make it boring.
1,The movie's title refers to a popular married Hollywood couple who are a big box office draw. Unfortunately, just when they have a new movie coming out, their private acrimonious split has become public, and film publicist Lee tries to reunite them, at least for show, for a press junket. Also involved in matters are the wife's sister and publicist, as well as Hector, the wife's lover. Of course their involvement complicates matters further.		This might have been great as a screwball farce, but instead it is cute and sentimental, trying to make an unpleasant scenario "nice". It didn't work.
1,Do not waste your time on this movie. It is not worth your time or money. I gave this a two star because it was not as serious of a movie as the DVD cover lead you to believe.
1,my daughter was very disappointed in this version of Ariel.  She couldn't recognize that this could possibly be the same as the feisty original little mermaid.  We'll keep the original and probably ariel's beginning, but return to the sea is destined for the donation pile.
1,I bought this blueray twice but had to send both copies back and finally got the film on DVD.  I have two blueray players but this one didn't play on either and this is the first film that hasn't.  The DVD is fine and the movie is well worth seeing.  And if you like this one you'll love The East by the same writers, director, and actress.  I'm a big fan.  But the blueray was disappointing only because it wouldn't play.  But this movie doesn't lose anything by not being on blueray.
1,What the heck happened?  After a dramatic start that sets the table for pending doom and fatalism, 28 DAYS LATER devolves into a trite and lackluster military bash.  It was much more interesting watching Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris doing battle with hordes of infected humans rather than a platoon of nimrods, but apparently director Danny Boyle decided a jarhead in fatigues was scarier than a snarling pack of red-eyed demons.  I know I'm shaking in my sandals.	Again, the entire premise of this film is fascinating:  A young man (Murphy) awakens from a 28-day coma to discover a deserted world.  Well, not entirely deserted--the shadow of night brings out a demented population of enraged people infected with a very cranky virus.  And like the zombie movies of old, the infected have a desire to kill the uninfected.  Thus, Jim, our hero, is rescued by a tiny band of "normal" humans, led by Selena (Harris), who possesses loads of street smarts and attitude.	The stage is set for a spellbinding, apolcalpytic tale--a grand tale of survival against overwhelming odds--but instead, 28 DAYS LATER dissolves into utter nonsense when our group of heroes abandons London and travels north, lured by a military radio broadcast promising safety in the wildnerness.  When I discovered the "real reason" for the broadcast I laughed so hard I rolled out of my chair, and almost hit the "STOP" button once and for all.  Once the conflict with about one dozen soldiers is established, the zombies merely become props.  Heck, the zombies even become instruments for the protagonists.	Go figure.	On second thought, don't waste your time figuring.  28 DAYS LATER is one of the most frustrating films I've ever watched, as golden potential for a white-knuckle thriller was squandered and subsequently flushed away down a cinematic commode.	--D. Mikels
1,they were all trying to be funny - but they weren't. the story basically centers on this Asian guy that his father wants to go to med school and be something. instead, he decides to be a loser with the rest of his friends. the worst part is, they curse/punch the dad at the end.. REALLY. i'm sorry that parent wanted his son to be something more than some pot smoking loser. i'm sure some losers out there will watch and get it, but i don't.
1,I don't know why I thought this movie would be good.  Typically nowadays disaster films are all about CGI and zero about the character developement and script.  It was HORRIBLE, TERRIBLE, LOUSY ACTING AND JUST PLAIN BORING!		There's not much else to really say.  Danny Glover as the president was moronic and couldn't act his way out of a paper bag.  The rest of the totally forgetable characters (I can't even remember any of their names!) were not expanded, developed, or cared about at all. The CGI was great but good movies aren't built on CGI, as history has shown, but Hollywood still doesn't get it.  I invest time in these films and they disappoint everytime.		Don't wsate your time.
1,Boring. Not at all interesting . Fine actors in the film, but the writing was poor. I did not even finish the movie.
1,Instead of returning this I throw it in the garbage.  It is in german language with no english subtitles.  Worst purchase ever.  Sorry I spend  money  on this.
1,BAD REPRODUCTION, SOUND QUALITY POOR AND COULD NOT UNDERSTAND A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF DIALOG.  REALLY NEEDED SUBTITLES FOR THIS VIDEO.
1,The movie was cute and the guys were ok.  However, the acting left a lot to be desired.  I wish it had been available for free on Amazon Prime.
1,One of my favorite movies. Just had to give this blu-ray copy of the movie one star for not what I expected. Waiting on the 4k version.
1,There is no reason this movie was remade other than money. It is horrible and pointless just as the many sequels were.  What makes me the most sad  is that some kid in the next 10 years will read a review of how Halloween is on the list of best horror movies ever made and will pick up this garbage instead of the original. Art is dying this is proof.
1,none
1,One of the worse Tyler Perry Madea movies. Was disappointed.
1,Really bad dvd!
1,Good only if you are testing to see if you have your settings correct to watch soemthing on your computer but too short to enjoy as a story or movie.
1,Fair
1,The director took a chainsaw to the Prisoner of Azkaban novel, and in the style of Leatherface, hacked it up to nothing.		This movie fled so far off the path of the book it was frightening.  There were many non-canon moments, and many moments that could have been cut in favor of some more important deleted scenes.  The Knight Bus, while funny, was very different from the usual, and the  Marauders were practically non-existent.		If I had only seen the movie and not read the book, then I would've come out confused:		Who are the Marauders?  Maybe that'll be answered in a later movie...		But the question is answered in book 3, so why not in movie 3?		I did not like the Patronus, as this idea of rolling waves of light is not going to work, especially in the future movie adaptions (DA in movie 5, anyone?).		There were some non-canon moments that, again, could have been cut in favor of some of the more important canon deleted scenes.		The scene where Harry finds out about Sirius being his Godfather... the book did this about a million times better.  And Dan:  You are a good actor, but you need to learn how to fake cry.  You suck at it.  That whole scene was cheesey and badly invisioned.		So, why does this movie earn one star?  As a movie alone, it was the best.  So it would, actually, have five stars if HP was not a book series.  It loses 4 of those 5 stars for being the worst movie compared to the books.
1,Unwatchable. Jerky camera movements make me want to vomit. When will the filmmakers learn not to do this? I checked several places in the film and they all had the same deliberately handheld swimmy, jerky camera movements. Too bad - finally a movie that seemed aimed at intelligence rather than fart jokes and doofy romance.
1,"The Eye" tries to utilize the same formula as "The Ring" and a slew of other movies of the same type of genre.  These Japanese translated into American versions of "horror films" is redundant at this point, because none of them are delivering what they so desperately want, which is cover your eyes gasping terror.  I don't know who they are marketing these films to, horror fans?  Well try again,  there are too many good horror films that have all the suspense and blood and guts you can handle to even take 'The Eye" seriously.  "The Eye" was too busy trying to make each scene look pretty, and the story was borderline interesting.  But after seeing trash like "The Grudge" 1 and 2, all of the novelties of this amatuer scare tactic type suspense thriller doesn't work.  It's not creepy, it's not disturbing, it's not horrific, it's childish. This is yet another one that I couldn't sit through, I actually had to force myself to even watch half of it.  I'll stick to "The Ring", Naomi Watts rules!
1,Garbage
1,Just one word. Boring.	 Bad story.
1,Kind of losing me. Not sure I will  buy the rest of the season on Amazon. I am 3 shows into it.
1,As far as mysteries go, this was good and kept me guessing. The inspector shows more emotion in Season 2 but is bewildered why his wife, who he hardly sees because of his work, would be getting bored with her life. The nudity was distracting, even full frontal male nudity that wasn't necessary. I should have read the reviews better before buying.
1,Not worth the time to bother watching. I stopped after just a few minutes.
1,Snoozer.
1,Dave Carradine (what little we see of him, before he	gets bumped off), plays a overzealous FBI agent/MIB	type paranormal fiend-fighter, who runs into two ser-	ial killers among a bunch of weird residents of a small	texas town. Mike Bowen, Carradines Brother-in-law of his	fourth or fifth wife (in real life) in Serial Killer no. 1.		Here's the storyline; there are two serial killers in	the same small Texas town. One beats up and rapes the other	serial killers wife (!) and uses his killings as motivation	to not be outdone! There are interruptions galore as two	interviewers keep asking redudent q's out of a host of over-	the-top characters that are just plain weird and not funny!		Darren Burrows gets some overdue face time here,	but whatever Quinton Tarantino is smoking, is he ser-	ious when he claims this is 'great'? He just wanted Dave	back to sell his 'Kill Bill, II'!
1,Now, if you're offended or angered by someone not liking this movie because you DO, save yourself some grief and move on to the next review. If you're considering renting or purchasing this movie, what follows is just one person's opinion.		Impressive production design doesn't necessarily make for a successful movie. Case in point: MIRRORS. Where do I begin? Incredibly amateur dialogue, especially the howlingly unrealistic exposition. It sounds like a first draft, not a finished film script. Capable actors do their best with it but one wonders how they were directed. HUGE plot holes where logic flies out the window to serve getting the hero from point A to point B. Why go on and on about how a character is a fallen cop and then allow him access to all this police information? This convenience reaches new depths in the last half hour of the movie, with its far-from-unique possession cliche's.		After watching a film like this, I wonder why the people behind it didn't just make a video game. Why bother with plot and characters if they're going to be so unbelievable? Have your cool, scary images and leave it at that.		There are some promising ideas here and there. AND some different takes on themes which have been explored in other films. A few "every parent's nightmare" parts would've been more effective if the film was a bit more grounded in believability.		I wanted to like MIRRORS. I'd read some good reviews. However, it just made me angry and frustrated. Especially since it uses one of the most embarassingly formulaic ways of resolving a story like this. And a twist ending which could've been heartwrenching had it involved characters I could relate to.
1,It's ok movie
1,I would not waste my time.
1,I have waited to buy this box set on DVD, as the first box set didn't include two famous scenes. On the Christmas episode, the turkey weighing part was missing(one of the funniest parts). On the Do It Yourself episode, same thing! Missing part when older lady gets trapped by crazy recliner due to Mr. Beans intervention! So, I hung onto my old VHS copies, that are un-edited. I saw this newer version that includes both Bean movies and hoped they had listened to past complaints and re-did the editing on the t.v. episodes. OH NO! They are just copies of the original, badly edited first edition DVDs! Terrible, expected much better. I'm sure Mr. Atkinson and his fellow writers would be appalled!
1,I have this movie already on laserdisc and CED (the letterboxed laserdisc from 1990 is very good for its time.) I would like to comment on the quality of this HD-DVD, but I can't despite having gone through FOUR copies of it. NONE of them will even load on any of my 4 Toshiba HD-DVD players!		I've been collecting HD-DVDs since the format died and have almost every US title, but having just gotten around to watching some of them I've found Warner discs have either a very high defect rate or they are experiencing 'laser rot', where a disc may become unreadable over time. Regardless of HD-DVD ending up as a dead format, there's no excuse for this high of a defect rate. I contacted Warner about this problem to see if they might possibly replace my bad discs with Blu-Ray copies of the same movies, and was told that would only be possible if I still had the receipts and then ONLY if they were purchased from a regular retailer; Amazon 3rd-party sellers wouldn't qualify even though the discs were brand-new when I bought them. Contrast that with Universal's policy in the 80s and 90s of replacing ANY laserdisc that failed after ANY length of time, no questions asked, since they were designed to last forever when manufactured properly!		The Amazon seller I got this from has tried to help by sending replacements and will refund me for these if they can't obtain working copies, so at least that's something. Warner should be extremely ashamed for such shoddy disc manufacturing however, and even more shame on them for not owning up to it (at the time these were made Warner owned the manufacturing plant, though it has since been sold to Cinram, and Warner now uses Technicolor currently which had many problems of its own with standard DVDs a few years ago.)
1,...I watched it at school, and everyone in my class was either sleeping or scratching their heads in confusion. I just don't understand why Spielberg made this movie...along the way, people started talking in random languages (pardon me for being vague, I don't remember WHICH languages) and, well...it was just weird. Why did they? I have no idea. The ending just baffled me...*spoiler* why did he walk onto the spaceship? HUH? Maybe I was just having a bad day, but it really made no sense to me. I was alternating between bored and frustrated at not understanding the 'plotline'.		Quite a poor effort, conclusively...this movie was weak.
1,I love the dead zone.  I find it to be very interesting and gripping.  But I see no purpose for this DVD.  This is the first episode, which is included in season 1, which is only 10 dollars more, so I cannot really think of a reason to own this dvd.  5 stars to the show, 1 for this dvd, just buy the season.
1,Pros: Paula Patton is a natural for acting. She's very likable.		Cons:  The entire cast except for Patton was overacted.  Luke-warm storyline which dragged and dragged...to the point I found myself asking at different points throughout the movie if it was going to be over SOON.		Conclusion:  I'll be glad to watch Patton in a different feature but the bottom line remains that this film is a rip-off. Amazon should lower its price. Not worth the time or money.
1,I don't have this item
1,This is just an ordinary movie, not real bad, just below average.  John Rhys-Davies and Joss Acklund add a little in name value, but after an interesting inventive narrative at the beginning it never really comes across.  Good idea, too many flaws in the script and not really explained well backstories on many of the characters.  You follow a group of archeologist and others into a hidden pyramid that is revealed by a huge sandstorm just three days before a event that takes place once in 5000 years.  Now they have to get in in three days and find the secret that only John Rhys-Davies knows.  They tease you with a mummy and the idea of aliens (which you know because of the opening narrative), but none of the cast except John Rhys-Davies knows.  Everyone else is just confused.
1,I assure you that I'm not ruining it for you by saying the ending is as stupid as one could possibly imagine. It's really a film that leaves you wondering, through the whole thing, how it's going to turn out. Answer: It turns out really really stupid, as in "Man, whoever wrote this was an idiot" stupid. Not just disappointing. I mean ... why did this get to production stupid? How many Hollywood big-shots does it take to be really really stupid stupid. It's not a "smart but confusing" sci-fi film as the promoters describe it. It's confusing because it's wrong ... illogically wrong. The ending does not actually make any logical sense at all. No, that's not what would happen. It's just stupid.
1,What I really hate is the fact that I somehow was led to purchasing the movie without my knowledge. This happened once before and I wish Netflix would make it more difficult to order a pay for product so easily.
1,Director Seth Gordon's previous feature, "Horrible Bosses" (2012), wasn't anything special as a comedy despite its potential, but it contained a few clever moments to make it worthwhile. "Identity Thief" makes a fatal mistake when Gordon attempts to incorporate a dramatic element to the story line. By going in this direction, it is no longer possible to view "Identity Thief" as a compilation of marginal fat jokes, sex gags, and slapstick humor. Instead, we are forced to absorb a "serious" aspect that is so poorly rendered it's unbearable to watch. There are bad movies, and then there's "Identity Thief." keep your money.
1,I was unable to complete this movie.
1,The rating on this item is solely based on the packaging.  The DVD comes in a cardboard envelope which does not protect the disc against damage.  For $20.00, I would think the manufacturer could provide a standard DVD case for this item.
1,Worst movie ever!
1,bought this yesterday bc the previews lookd cool, when i started watching it i soon turned off the crappy 3d, and turnd on the 2d picture, wanted to see some 3d but first off this movie has the dreadful black lines on the top and bottom of the screen makin 3d watching so horrible to watch, just a crappy story,and crappy actors and doesnt tell you,how the aleins got here nor shows them beating them at the end, they just floated away in a sub. come on people and the aliens cant see you thru some glass, give me a break
1,I didn't laugh once! This movie sucks! Like what the heck were those morons thinking making this crap. It's not funny having random celebs and movie characters pop out of nowhere and say something stupid. people who enjoy this s#%* A. Have no taste in film and B. are like 12 years old. That's why these movies keep on getting made because the 12-14 year olds keep paying to see them at the box office!  worst movie ever! I'm applaud that people on amazon gave this a 5 star rating... What the hell?
1,There is no question Aaron Sorkin can tell a story through structure and dialogue.		There simple is no one better.		So I would give The Newsroom five stars...except...its political revenge porn for MSNBC viewers exclusively. If you're part of half the country Aaron Sorkin hates (anyone who doesnt vote Democrat, lives in stupid and adults who thinks angels are real), then this show isn't for you. I watch because each episode can be a masters course in writing. But I really, really, really have to hold my nose as Sorkin takes out his rage through his intolerance of anyone who doesnt believe as he believes politically and lives their lives in Church (Studio 60 was not as political but his disdain for religion pours out of the TV all over the floor).		You can tell Aaron Sorkin grew up on the East Coast and has lived his life on the West Coast. Im sure it makes his skin crawl to fly over Indiana or Ohio, Kentucky or Tennessee when flying back to New York.		Its really too bad. None of his shows benefit from being hateful like this. Just tell a story. Leave politics and religion alone. It really is too bad.
1,Three words, WTF? . After watching this movie, I thought about joining the armed forces so I could go exact some type of mindless violence on some unsuspecting individual I did not know in some foreign country with an unpronounceable name. Not only am I a fan, I now feel as if my sole mission in life is to educate those individuals who think they are fans, along with those whose first encounter with the Transformers will be this film, as to what they should expect, and more importantly what they should accept. I have traveled around the globe, bid vigorously on eBay, and sacrificed much in an attempt to acquire the toys I need to create the ultimate collection. Not a complete collection, but a collection that will one day, hopefully, be part of a Transformer display of museum quality. I have learned some Japanese, and manipulated 2 of my siblings into learning the language and the culture of the creators so that I might create a seamless conjunction of timelines to aid in my mission; (you may have even read one of their reviews.)		This travesty of a movie was so terrible, I believe many viewers were left in such denial as to be unable to provide rational reviews. Many fans wanted this movie to be so great so badly they must have become delusional, their minds creating the story they wanted to see. I challenge everyone who saw this movie to ask themselves, their friends, what happened during the movie. You will find yourselves drawing a blank. Those who have seen this flick more than once have done so only because subconsciously your trying to fill in the blank. Think about it.		I have, and while I can quote lines from the 1st movie verbatim, I have a hard time remembering anything about this movie other than the scenty, dangly thing hanging on Bumblebee's mirror...you know what I am talking about. Bah weep grahn ah weep ninee bahm. Another issue I have, not just with the movie, is the latest obsession with every Autobot Leader being Optimus Prime, and every Decepticon Leader being Megatron. If you are going to use these names you had d@#m well better put them in the movie. Optimus was a basic rig and Megatron was a gun. And, do not make excuses about mass to size ratios and gun laws. Anyone who has ever seen the Transformers knows that part of their arsenal of advanced technology includes mass shifting and subspace shunts. Their aliens for crying out loud, but they are not bugs. Furthermore, the question everyone should have been asking was "Where did Optimus Prime's trailer go?" Not, "Why does he have a mouth?"		Anybody involved in filmmaking or entertainment knows that a good story always has underlying themes. With the Transformers there were several. The proverbial battle between good and evil, the integration of biblical undertones, the political influence of the time; The Cold War, (why do you think the good guys had blue eyes and the bad guys had red eyes?) Even the names meant something. The name Optimus Prime, for example, is derived from the Latin words for best, and another meaning 1st in occurrence, and Megatron, mega meaning large/great/powerful and tron meaning machine. This movie does not possess any of these aspects. In layman's terms...it suc?ed big time.		Yes, I am a '80s child as well. I watched the cartoons and had the toys. Heck, I still have many of them still in the box; OCD. The whole machine to robot thing has always been awesome. Even now, I have some hope that the sequel will adhere to the spirit of the legend Transformers has become.		The special effects were great, the actors too. Unfortunately, there were too humans and not enough Transformers. The storyline behind this movie blew, and the movie ended with a whimper, not a bang. Too much of this movie was spent on the wrong thing, much like Deep Impact. This movie is supposed to be about TRANSFORMERS. The plot had massive holes through it, especially in the final scene.		I would strongly recommend that original fans of the 80's cartoon stay away from this movie. In addition, I also recommend that you write to Hasbro and tell them to get it together. If you see it you will be disappointed. The 80s cartoon movie was so much better than this in terms of storyline. Michael Bay is now on my list of most hated directors. Brian Goldner allowed Transformers to be distasteful and obnoxious, though I am not surprised considering his track record and lack of interest in the Transformers until he realized just how much money they can generate.		Why throw away your money so recklessly? That is the question you should ask yourself. Do yourself a favor...rent it. 'Till all are one.
1,Not particularly interesting.
1,Copying my e-mail to feedbackus@fox.com:		Your Blu-ray disc gives an error of unlicensed for playback in my Blu-ray player, a new purchase this Christmas.		Your Digital Copy mechanism does not work, at-all. I cannot play the movie in iTunes.		I'm getting my money back.		Sincerely,		David Goodnow
1,STUPID
1,As usual, this ''Star Wars: The Complete Saga (Episodes I-VI) (Blu-ray)'' contains the altered versions of the original trilogy from the 70s and 80s.
1,Horrible could not continue to watch.
1,I just watched this on cable television and am really glad  I spent neither money or shelf space on this movie.  The acting was bad and the story line forced.  I gave it two stars instead of one because was able to make it all the way through without turning it off and walking away in disgust.  On the up side, I got all my laundry folded and ironing done.
1,Boring
1,The "Mr. Bill" short films are as bizarrely endearing as ever, but the DVD is a disaster.  (Note that all the earlier reviews are for the VHS tape.)	Here's the rub: ***ALL*** scanning and skipping functions are disabled throughout the entire disc!  Want to go to  the next film? Don't press the skip button; it won't work.  You have to go back to the tedious menu and arrow your way slowly to the episode you want.  Want to back up or fast forward a little in the film you're watching?  Sorry, but there's  no way AT ALL to do that.	This disc is a cruel joke and should be withdrawn. It cannot be recommended at all as issued, though I found it impossible to give poor Mr. Bill only one star....
1,Regardless of the sale price, Good Advice isn't worth a dime. A true embarrassment for a quality actress, Angie Harmon.
1,Very dumb
1,They got 8 seasons? I did not like the first episode at all!	I will try to start watching from maybe season 4!
1,This movie was just stOOpid. You have Mrs. Spielberg, Shia LeBeouf and the girl from Kiss Kiss Bang Bang running around being controled by the Hal 3000 computer (nice of them to bite off of 2001 with A.I. computer that is driven to madness by trying to understand human hypocracy and frailties). Billy Bob is in it looking skinnier than ever with his horrible 'natural' looking hair piece. Rosario Dawson and Michael 'The Shield' Chick-lets round out the cast but I find it hard to review their performances because the movie was so dumb it was mind numbing.		This is one of those Bruckheimer type 'THRILL RIDES' that is devoid of an intelligent story and that is full of roller coaster ride like effects.		STUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUPID!
1,To slow.
1,If your idea of fun is to spend two hours in the presence of boring, directionless rich people as they waste their lives, by all means watch this. This is the sort of arty director's film in which critics find great meaning. Baloney. I found it stupid and a waste of time.
1,Not good.
1,[NINA - CRAZY SUICIDE GIRL - 2011 - Full screen - 80 minutes - Italian w/ English subtitles - directed by Christian Arioli] First, and most importantly, ignore the hyped details in the synopsis listed here, which are also on the dvd case, so no one's at fault except the rats promoting this swill. Sure, sure, ALL the ingredients for a great exploitation grindhouse paradise are depicted in the narrative, but the immature execution, lifeless acting, lousy direction and complete lack of budget negate any entertainment value entirely. So don't fall prey to the hype as I did, and often have as a lover of transgressive cinema. This clunker needs to remain under everyone's radar, except possibly the MST3K crowd and those seeking a new low in irredeemable films.		On the surface, the stratagem appears watertight - a bunch of female models are coerced into doing gonzo porno before being kidnapped by an underworld mob-run video group that has ties to a satanic cult that captures and kills in pursuit of supreme occult power who are being tracked down by a bounty-hunting female assassin who utilizes Japanese swordplay to bring dark justice to the criminals when she's not using a blow-torch to wrangle info out of sleazy smut peddlers, gangsters and druglords - so how can you screw this up, for chrissakes, when it's absolutely golden in concept? Oh, let me count the ways...		First, the female lead is wooden (leaden?) and too old for the role (a decent MILF maybe, but), exhibits no fighting skills and only uses a Katana sword once during the film - nothing like the grindhouse mixture of 70's Asian, Italian giallo and Tarantino pulp cinema influences touted here to sell this turkey. There are no highs, just lows, leaving every frame flat and thirsty for more of what we signed on for. There's a sprinkle of brutality and nudity, but not enough ultra-violence, bloodshed, undraped female flesh, satanic sleaze or indecent insanity to make a decent, enjoyable flick as described. You're better off watching a nostalgically bad but bona fide 70's Eurohorror or Italian crime drama by Fernando Di Leo (there'll be superior violence, gratuitous sleaze and better looking women) - this film wants to be those things, but comes off as disingenuous and deceptive, as well as poorly implemented. What a shame...		In short, NINA's no GIRL, you'd have to be CRAZY enough for SUICIDE to suffer through after reading this review. Spare yourself.
1,Crap
1,Was looking forward to the usual thrills with Denzel  at the helm, but this movie was all formula written with all the bells and whistles of an ice cream truck at the beach and requisite chase scenes, graphic gore, and body count amateurishly written for today's ADD audiences. First of all, Denzel has turned into The Mumbler - couldn't understand a thing he said several times even by turning up the sound. His presence always effuses a cool air, but he is kind of lame here. Then, there is the stone-cold-predictable Sam Shepard -one look at him, flashback to Swordfish, and VIOLA the plot is pre-solved.  One enjoyable role was his Weston's sexy girlfriend. And that's about it. I rent it first then decide to buy the DVD. Not this one. Dean Corso
1,If you're fond of distorted images associated with funhouse mirrors you may enjoy the pervasive image distortion that defines the transposition of this movie from its engineered wrap-around big screen CineRama format to your TV or computer screen.  Other than that visual insult, the events depicted contain a few grains of historical reality, which are thoroughly overwhelmed by patently untrue and unbelievable Hollyweird fantasy.  How The West Was Won is about as believable as Broadway musicals such as Brigadoon, Finnians Rainbow, South Pacific, Oklahoma and Lil Abner.  The actors who were conned into appearing in this fairy-tale fiasco on film have my sympathy.
1,I cannot find anything much to recommend in this mostly pointless remake. See the 1965 James Stewart/Richard Attenborough/Robert Aldrich film instead. I can't even recommend the remake for big fans of the original, such as myself, because this one adds nothing, loses much, and benefits no one except possibly the folks who got paid to make the film. On that score I'm happy for them, but this will not be at the top of anyone's resume.
1,Totally garbage movie.  Poor acting, poor directing, and Stupid storyline.  Should be shown to prisoners as punishment.  Do not recommend
1,So much f word turned it off. Distracts from action
1,Made for TV caliber stinker remake of a for-its-time decent horror movie. Acting is bad with TV actors. The dialogue is bad to corny at best. The story is completely unbelievable. Continuity was all over the place. This was just one of those plain old bad movies on cable that you somehow find yourself in front of after stumbling in late on a Saturday night.		I remember the original as being a bit more entertaining, but that was like 25 years ago (the original The Fog was actually the first movie that I saw on cable TV in like 1980). So if you're in the mood for a Foggy evening, rent the original. There's no way it couldn't be better than this amateurish remake.		More than enough said.
1,I saw a display in DC on the events leading up to and including what happened the night of Lincoln's assassination and the subsequent days that gave a great deal of detail that was completely missing from movie. While I can guess that Redford was trying to show the injustice of the trial, it only ended up coming across like a pro-assassin piece.		You have to watch this movie as the fiction that it is -- it has not tried to sell itself as a documentary and would never pass as such. Pretty much every major detail of the events were left out or flat out depicted incorrectly. Based on actual history, there was no doubt that Mary Surratt was guilty. While I have no doubt the tribunal was not friendly to Surratt, it would not have taken the complete railroading and disregard for the law that this movie portrayed to find her guilty.		I always enjoy McAvoy, which is why I put this movie on, but even he was hard to sit through. What could have been a truly interesting movie (I would have highly recommended the display I saw in DC if it was still showing, as it was fascinating) was just bogged down with fiction.
1,The kids like it but the characters are really annoying in this one.  No redeeming value, worst LBT yet.
1,I was given this by a friend and thought that I vaguely remembered it from my youth. As i watched this I was struck by how poor the animation was and how under cooked the stories were. I know most of the reviews on here are favorable but I just can't say that this one aged as well as some of the other shows that they are bring out now. This one just didn't work for me.
1,Just plain strange. Do not buy!
1,I know it's a popular show but it is really, really insipid and pointless.
1,Premise is promising. Whoever green lighted this at Asian Crush needs a ROPE around their necks. FAST!		All momentum and NO yield! I will NEVER get back the two hours I spent watching this "film". If I took that massive dump I should have during this film, I might have missed something. Oh well...		Pros: Subtle tension; so subtle that smooth glass is rougher. The male lead, Lee Dong Wook, is really, really superb. You think he's a loser bum or unemployed but he f**king OWNS a high-end Japanese restaurant in this Korean city. Damn, didn't see that coming.		Cons: No action, no big romantic end scene, everything implied. Did she end up going out with him? Great romance like Anthony and Cleopatra? Did it turn out to be a great marriage? Does she live a more meaningful life other than the routine one that every pretty single woman in Seoul lives? Does the female main character get out of that dead-end library job?		At first I was thinking I was some room temperature-IQ knuckledragger who missed the meaning of the "film" (term used loosely here) I do not have an MFA from some half-assed cinema school to defend or justify!		The curly-haired library volunteer was useless. He had no chance to get ANYWHERE with female lead; left to maintain his existence with his pathetic "one-hand romance plan"...		You want to give an epic beat-down to the good-for-nothing female characters. All are a waste of oxygen. They need to be bitch-slapped. HARD.		Overall, if you like all build-up and absolutely no release, torture yourself by watching this movie.		Warning: if you watch this during date night, I GUARANTEE you will get NO ACTION afterwards...PATHETIC....
1,The dragon on the cover as well as the use of the word DRAGON should have been banned.  It only appeared once at the very beginning and actually for 20seconds at the end.  This was a super low budget below High School drama level movie.  For fights they shook the camera and you only saw  blurred images. The story was worse than the actors and the 4' woman warrior/love interest teenybopper with the "padded outfit" to add "interest?" and the build of a 8 year old was really bad.  Forgive me this analogy, but I wonder if she was included for the pedophiles market, because she did nothing and there was NO STORY & NO ACTION & NO ACTORS, just stupid talking and slow walking in what may have been someone's backyard and maybe a city park for the shots with the trees.  Kmart sheets for tents must have doubled the cost of the movie. No one carried a bow till they appeared to want to use it but never did...except in the opening shot. I tossed this DVD after paying for it.  IT HAD NO REDEAMING QUALITIES...NONE!!! This was the worst video I have ever ever watched/purchased.
1,The first three Saw film weren't bad. They weren't exactly classics, but they weren't bad. After the third ended and Jigsaw died, apparently someone decided to really go for something and continue the whole Saw series anyway. What we get is a disastrous hodgepodge of bizarre plot twists, ridiculous new characters, poorly designed "traps" that come nowhere near as entertaining as the earlier ones, and worst of all, they try to add depth to John, also known as Jigsaw.		Look, Jigsaw was never scary. Ever. Nor was he profound in any way. He was even less scary with that totally ridiculous clown mask, and even more comical with the pig mask. If those were genuinely meant to be frightening, they had the exact opposite effect. The laughing doll on the tricycle was beyond stupid, and John's antihero motives were, to put it in a word, absurd. The writers continued to run with John somehow being deep or intelligent or somehow unique and worth following, and they failed so miserably that V makes sure not to make up for the catastrophic failure that was IV.		So, here we are again. If IV wasn't bad enough with the flashbacks and completely unnecessary backstory behind Jigsaw and some other characters that we could not care less about, V amps it up. Now we get more about his wife, the detectives, some more random flesh to blow up, and, worst of all, an attempt at adding meaning to the story, which turned into a dismal failure that grated on everyone's nerves. No one ever cared in the slightest about John, anything about him, his "antivillain" persona, or anyone related to him in any way. We simply do not care, and none of the Saw films after III succeeded in what they tried to do, which was to add depth to an already-ridiculous story. John still comes off as an insensible weirdo, everything is still mind-numbingly implausible, the "twists" are completely meaningless (especially for a series in which we never cared in the slightest about the story and just wanted to see the goddamned traps--this is a horror film, not a thriller, despite its best efforts), and nothing really changes. In-between trap scenes, we get all these flashbacks of the past Saw films with more context added. Why? Really, why? Who watched these films and thought the story had any potential to be something to be taken seriously? One person? No one?		V doesn't learn one bit from its mistakes with IV, and continues to run with the story, despite the fact that Jigsaw is dead, but somehow not dead, and also somehow has accomplices now. Really, the writers just had to come up with *something*, so this is the end result, but come on. I never watched another Saw film after this one, just because I knew I was going to get more of the same childish nonsense that takes itself seriously in-between terribly lame and boring traps. Backstory's the name of the game in V, and the fact still remains that it's boring, stupid, shallow, and Jigsaw is just not interesting, scary, profound, or in any way notable--just his traps. John is actually quite grating with his constant monologues of "rehabilitating" people with his traps, claiming not to be murderer, but do any of us believe for a second that his motives are what we care about? Why would anyone care? He's just some guy with a warped philosophy of how to "rehabilitate" criminals, drug dealers, rapists, or otherwise morally questionable people.		We. Do. Not. Care. Not about John, not about his wife, not about a single character that has ever existed in Saw who we're just assumed to care about. No one does. Why should we? The film doesn't bother with that part--the fact that they're connected to Jigsaw is apparently good enough. Well, no, it isn't, actually. Jigsaw is a ridiculous villain, a boring serial killer with childish ideas of morality, a completely not-scary persona, and that same mask he's been using since the beginning which has never once instilled the slightest fear in anyone who's at all familiar with well-designed horror villains. Even Freddy Krueger, through nearly ten Nightmare on Elm Street films, didn't bother that much with his backstory, because his backstory was never important. We just wanted to see him kill people in the dreams he created for them. That's it. The same goes for Jigsaw--we just want to see the traps. We don't care about who's doing it, because that's a moot point unless it's something really, really special. John is not special. He's boring and stupid. Just get to the freaking traps.		If IV wasn't bad enough, V just ignores everything that was wrong with it and keeps going with the insensible story and its trademark deep green color that seem to glow on every single object there is. It's not scary or suspenseful in any way, and V is the most boring one I've seen, as well as the most insulting, since I never got past this one, doubting they could make up for this new direction they were going in just for the sake of continuing the series.		Saw V fails on every single count. It's not as gory as the previous installments, the traps are boring, the characters are boring, the entire story is boring, the "twists" are beyond stupid and also meaningless, and the film tries the whole time to be something it can never be, as something intellectual on some level. We're supposed to feel something for John for some reason, despite that he's just not interesting, and, you know, we already saw him die once after the trilogy ended. Where do you go after that? Well, this film thinks the best course of action is to just add a lot of meaningless details in a mindless effort to allow for a new one next year. Terrible on any standard, and a yawn-inducing horror film, and a film that's meant to keep you on the edge of your seat that instead just keeps you checking your watch wondering when it's going to end definitely has a problem. Well, here you go, the continuation of the downward spiral of Saw's ability to entertain even shock-horror fans. Having never seen the sequels past this one, I can only imagine how those went, but V has officially stopped my involvement in a franchise that should have never continued past III.		Just disastrous.
1,Unimpressive and boring.  What could have been a good plot was predictable and slow.  Christopher Walken is quirky, but can't carry a whole movie.
1,The premise was good but there was no chemistry between the main characters. It was very predictable but had some pretty funny moments.
1,The movie has an opening shot of Scarlett Johanssen's buttocks-which proves to be prophetic.		With Bill Murray, I was expecting this to be a comedy. But it is not-unless you count the scenes of Japanese people acting like crude stereotypes.		Bill Murray plays a washed-up actor who goes to Japan to do a Japanese whiskey commercial, staying in an expensive hotel in the process. Scarlett plays the wife of a workaholic, also staying at the hotel while her husband is involved in his job, leaving her alone. Basically it's a pastiche of scenes of everyone talking, or lying around in their hotel rooms, or interacting with Japanese stereotypes, until the two meet in a bar. But then I stopped the movie-too many long,boring scenes of nothing happening. And from the negative comments here, I realized that there was no reward if I had watched to the end.		My review title means, in Japanese, "This movie is boring." I wonder if any Japanese saw it, and if any of them liked it.
1,Anyone considering buying this DVD should note that it was done in 1994. This DVD gives a cursory review of Mike Tyson and does NOT include his professional and personal battles after prison.  The interviews are good and keeps a steady pace, but more could have been said.
1,Summary of the movie: old Western meets Predator-like Indian people who barely wear clothes.		The actors did well. The movie was interesting at first but little could save this movie. Long and tedious, bad script, and unnecessarily gross at times. I wonder if it could have been better if they tightened the script and changed the antagonists. Kurt Russell was the star who gave this movie some credibility. Otherwise a real waste. Yikes. Even watched this for free and I still say stay far away. Give two stars simply because it's not the worst movie I've ever seen--just not good.
1,*** This review may contain spoilers ***		Have you ever seen a topic trampled to death, a scene duplicated so many times you could scream, an overkill of meanies, ne'er do wells, and evil doers? Well you are in luck with this gem! I was extremely unaware concerning the unfair cruel treatment of Japanese Americans in the Western US. What an educational opportunity to give just a simple glimpse of what horrors were incurred by these people. No, we get the same tired reaction with almost every character to an aged disabled one armed er, bandit???		The Jeep chase scene was ridiculously gratuitous and if they wanted the chap to high tail it, why not offer him a ride to Roswell???? Typically in most scripts, when you have a deep secret to hide, everyone plays over the top sweet and accommodating to DISTRACT the lone assassin. But here suspicion is aroused minute one, upon arrival in Black Rock and this deepens in every scene with gleeful repetition, BORING!		The saving grace of revenge is the judo match with Ernest and here lies the mystery of the entire film! Where did he learn those Bruce Lee moves??? They certainly did not teach that in Basic! Spence leans towards white on white, so any inclination towards a mixed heritage is sorely lost on his character.		This film had such a great opportunity to educate the masses concerning racism against Japanese Americans and failed miserably. I did find Tracy's acting superb and can recommend solely for this aspect.
1,I gave it a two-star rather than a one-star review, because I didn't "hate" the video, I just couldn't finish watching it.  I shut it off after the first five minutes; it not only failed to capture my attention, but the music score overshadowed the dialogue.  A few days later I tried again, for ten to fifteen minutes. Off again.  For those of you who prefer, or require closed caption, this video doesn't have it.
1,Oh joy.  Another thriller that places an attractive young (white) female struggling with mental illness confronts a seemingly supernatural force while stuck in her boyfriend's house.  The world doesn't have quite enough of these yet.  The empty characters, predictable plot, and lame attempts at scares will leave you wondering, "Why am I watching this" right up until the end.
